Existing methods\nsuch as heuristic simulations and LLM based generators often lack structural\ncoherence or controllability, producing synthetic data that fails to accurately\nrepresent real world system interactions. This paper presents a framework that\nintegrates Finite State Machines or FSMs with Generative Flow Networks or\nGFlowNets to generate structured, semantically valid, and diverse synthetic\nevent logs. Our FSM-constrained GFlowNet ensures syntactic validity and\nbehavioral variation through dynamic action masking and guided sampling. The\nFSM, derived from expert traces, encodes domain-specific rules, while the\nGFlowNet is trained using a flow matching objective with a hybrid reward\nbalancing FSM compliance and statistical fidelity. We instantiate the framework\nin the context of UI interaction logs using the UIC HCI dataset, but the\napproach generalizes to any symbolic sequence domain. Experimental results\nbased on distributional metrics show that our FSM GFlowNet produces realistic,\nstructurally consistent logs, achieving, for instance, under the real user logs\nbaseline, a KL divergence of 0.2769 and Chi squared distance of 0.3522,\nsignificantly outperforming GPT-4o's 2.5294/13.8020 and Gemini's\n3.7233/63.0355, alongside a leading bigram overlap of 0.1214 vs. GPT 4o's\n0.0028 and Gemini's 0.0007.

SEK-SMOD outperforms SRPT-$k$ across all loads and all job size\ndistributions. The key idea behind SEK-SMOD is to prioritize large jobs over\nsmall jobs in specific scenarios to improve server utilization, and thereby\nimprove the response time of subsequent jobs in expectation.

This service can\nreduce costs for both passengers and operators and reduce congestion and\nenvironmental impacts. A key limitation, however, is its myopic\ndecision-making, which overlooks long-term effects of dispatch decisions. To\naddress this, we propose a simulation-informed reinforcement learning (RL)\napproach. While RL has been widely studied in the context of ride-hailing\nsystems, its application in ride-pooling systems has been less explored. In\nthis study, we extend the learning and planning framework of Xu et al. (2018)\nfrom ride-hailing to ride-pooling by embedding a ride-pooling simulation within\nthe learning mechanism to enable non-myopic decision-making. In addition, we\npropose a complementary policy for rebalancing idle vehicles. By employing\nn-step temporal difference learning on simulated experiences, we derive\nspatiotemporal state values and subsequently evaluate the effectiveness of the\nnon-myopic policy using NYC taxi request data. Results demonstrate that the\nnon-myopic policy for matching can increase the service rate by up to 8.4%\nversus a myopic policy while reducing both in-vehicle and wait times for\npassengers. Furthermore, the proposed non-myopic policy can decrease fleet size\nby over 25% compared to a myopic policy, while maintaining the same level of\nperformance, thereby offering significant cost savings for operators.\nIncorporating rebalancing operations into the proposed framework cuts wait time\nby up to 27.3%, in-vehicle time by 12.5%, and raises service rate by 15.1%\ncompared to using the framework for matching decisions alone at the cost of\nincreased vehicle minutes traveled per passenger."}

To optimize instructions for black-box LLMs, recent methods employ\nwhite-box LLMs to generate candidate instructions from optimized soft prompts.\nHowever, white-box LLMs often map different soft prompts to the same\ninstruction, leading to redundant queries.

To\nachieve this, we construct a variational framework whose loss function\ncarefully balances data fidelity against the intrinsic geometric complexity of\nthe manifold. The former ensures the model effectively explains observed data,\nwhile the latter acts as a regularizer, penalizing overly curved or irregular\ngeometries to encourage simpler models and prevent overfitting. To address the\ncomputational challenges of this infinite-dimensional optimization problem, we\nintroduce a practical method based on discrete differential geometry: the\ncontinuous manifold is discretized into a triangular mesh, and the metric\ntensor is parameterized by edge lengths, enabling efficient optimization using\nautomatic differentiation tools.

Existing approaches often\nignore the geometry of the probability space or are computationally expensive.\nTo overcome these limitations, a new method is proposed that combines the\nparameterization of probability trajectories using a Bernstein basis and the\nminimization of the Wasserstein distance between distributions. The key idea is\nto model a conditional distribution as a smooth probability trajectory defined\nby a weighted sum of Gaussian components whose parameters -- the mean and\ncovariance -- are functions of the input variable constructed using Bernstein\npolynomials. The loss function is the averaged squared Wasserstein distance\nbetween the predicted Gaussian distributions and the empirical data, which\ntakes into account the geometry of the distributions. An autodiff-based\noptimization method is used to train the model. Experiments on synthetic\ndatasets that include complex trajectories demonstrated that the proposed\nmethod provides competitive approximation quality in terms of the Wasserstein\ndistance, Energy Distance, and RMSE metrics, especially in cases of pronounced\nnonlinearity. The model demonstrates trajectory smoothness that is better than\nor comparable to alternatives and robustness to changes in data structure,\nwhile maintaining high interpretability due to explicit parameterization via\ncontrol points. The developed approach represents a balanced solution that\ncombines geometric accuracy, computational practicality, and interpretability.\nProspects for further research include extending the method to non-Gaussian\ndistributions, applying entropy regularization to speed up computations, and\nadapting the approach to working with high-dimensional data for approximating\nsurfaces and more complex structures."}

To measure this, we introduce the Remote Labor Index (RLI), a\nbroadly multi-sector benchmark comprising real-world, economically valuable\nprojects designed to evaluate end-to-end agent performance in practical\nsettings. AI agents perform near the floor on RLI, with the highest-performing\nagent achieving an automation rate of 2.5%.

While prior work has attempted to mitigate this issue\nthrough algorithmic corrections or engineering alignments, we show that its\nroot cause lies in the floating point precision itself. The widely adopted\nBF16, despite its large dynamic range, introduces large rounding errors that\nbreaks the consistency between training and inference. In this work, we\ndemonstrate that simply reverting to \\textbf{FP16} effectively eliminates this\nmismatch. The change is simple, fully supported by modern frameworks with only\na few lines of code change, and requires no modification to the model\narchitecture or learning algorithm. Our results suggest that using FP16\nuniformly yields more stable optimization, faster convergence, and stronger\nperformance across diverse tasks, algorithms and frameworks. We hope these\nfindings motivate a broader reconsideration of precision trade-offs in RL\nfine-tuning."}

PCGs introduce substantial additional difficulty\nover linear congruential generators (LCGs) by applying a series of bit-wise\nshifts, XORs, rotations and truncations to the hidden state. We show that\nTransformers can nevertheless successfully perform in-context prediction on\nunseen sequences from diverse PCG variants, in tasks that are beyond published\nclassical attacks. In our experiments we scale moduli up to $2^{22}$ using up\nto $50$ million model parameters and datasets with up to $5$ billion tokens.\nSurprisingly, we find even when the output is truncated to a single bit, it can\nbe reliably predicted by the model. When multiple distinct PRNGs are presented\ntogether during training, the model can jointly learn them, identifying\nstructures from different permutations. We demonstrate a scaling law with\nmodulus $m$: the number of in-context sequence elements required for\nnear-perfect prediction grows as $\\sqrt{m}$. For larger moduli, optimization\nenters extended stagnation phases; in our experiments, learning moduli $m \\geq\n2^{20}$ requires incorporating training data from smaller moduli, demonstrating\na critical necessity for curriculum learning. Finally, we analyze embedding\nlayers and uncover a novel clustering phenomenon: the model spontaneously\ngroups the integer inputs into bitwise rotationally-invariant clusters,\nrevealing how representations can transfer from smaller to larger moduli."}

Many\nusers rely on cloud providers for elastic, isolated, and cost-efficient\nresources. Unfortunately, these platforms as a service use virtualization,\nwhich means operators have little insight into the users' workloads. This\nhinders resource optimizations by the operator, which is essential to ensure\ncost efficiency and minimize execution time. In this paper, we argue that\nworkload knowledge is unnecessary for system-level optimization. We propose\nSystem-X, which takes a \\emph{hardware-centric} approach, relying only on\nhardware signals -- fully accessible by operators. Using low-level signals\ncollected from the system, System-X detects anomalies through an unsupervised\nlearning pipeline. The pipeline is developed by analyzing over 30 popular ML\nmodels on various hardware platforms, ensuring adaptability to emerging\nworkloads and unknown deployment patterns. Using System-X, we successfully\nidentified both network and system configuration issues, accelerating the\nDeepSeek model by 5.97%."}
