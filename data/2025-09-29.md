### [1] [Redesigning GROMACS Halo Exchange: Improving Strong Scaling with GPU-initiated NVSHMEM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21527)
*Mahesh Doijade,Andrey Alekseenko,Ania Brown,Alan Gray,Szilárd Páll*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: 本文提出基于NVSHMEM的GPU内核启动的GROMACS域分解halo交换算法重设计，通过GPU内核融合数据打包和通信，利用硬件延迟隐藏实现细粒度重叠，显著提升分子动力学模拟的强扩展性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GROMACS分子动力学模拟在异构超级计算机上存在强扩展挑战，MPI的CPU中心特性在GPU驻留应用的关键路径上引入额外延迟，阻碍GPU利用率和可扩展性。

Method: 采用NVSHMEM的GPU内核启动重新设计域分解halo交换算法，高度调优的GPU内核融合数据打包和通信，利用异步复制引擎通过NVLink优化延迟和带宽。

Result: GPU驻留方案显著增加通信计算重叠，在NVLink上提升GROMACS强扩展性能达1.5倍（节点内）和2倍（多节点），在NVLink+InfiniBand多节点上提升1.3倍。

Conclusion: GPU启动通信对于强扩展各种延迟敏感应用具有深远益处。

Abstract: Improving time-to-solution in molecular dynamics simulations often requires
strong scaling due to fixed-sized problems. GROMACS is highly
latency-sensitive, with peak iteration rates in the sub-millisecond, making
scalability on heterogeneous supercomputers challenging. MPI's CPU-centric
nature introduces additional latencies on GPU-resident applications' critical
path, hindering GPU utilization and scalability. To address these limitations,
we present an NVSHMEM-based GPU kernel-initiated redesign of the GROMACS domain
decomposition halo-exchange algorithm. Highly tuned GPU kernels fuse data
packing and communication, leveraging hardware latency-hiding for fine-grained
overlap. We employ kernel fusion across overlapped data forwarding
communication phases and utilize the asynchronous copy engine over NVLink to
optimize latency and bandwidth. Our GPU-resident formulation greatly increases
communication-computation overlap, improving GROMACS strong scaling performance
across NVLink by up to 1.5x (intra-node) and 2x (multi-node), and up to 1.3x
multi-node over NVLink+InfiniBand. This demonstrates the profound benefits of
GPU-initiated communication for strong-scaling a broad range of
latency-sensitive applications.

*Chang Chen,Tiancheng Chen,Jiangfei Duan,Qianchao Zhu,Zerui Wang,Qinghao Hu,Peng Sun,Xiuhong Li,Chao Yang,Torsten Hoefler*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: Zeppelin是一个解决大语言模型训练中序列长度变化导致的负载不平衡问题的系统，通过分层序列分区、路由层和重映射层等技术，实现了比现有方法平均2.80倍的加速。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 训练大语言模型时，序列长度变化导致严重的负载不平衡问题，现有方法忽略了计算和通信成本随序列长度的变化，导致性能不佳。

Method: 1. 分层序列分区方法减少通信开销并平衡计算；2. 路由层协调节点间传输以充分利用NIC带宽；3. 重映射层在注意力和线性模块间转换序列布局。

Result: 在各种配置下的综合评估显示，Zeppelin相比最先进方法实现了平均2.80倍的加速。

Conclusion: Zeppelin通过解决序列长度变化带来的三个关键挑战，显著提高了大语言模型训练的效率。

Abstract: Training large language models (LLMs) with increasingly long and varying
sequence lengths introduces severe load imbalance challenges in large-scale
data-parallel training. Recent frameworks attempt to mitigate these issues
through data reorganization or hybrid parallel strategies. However, they often
overlook how computational and communication costs scale with sequence length,
resulting in suboptimal performance. We identify three critical challenges: (1)
varying computation-to-communication ratios across sequences of different
lengths in distributed attention, (2) mismatch between static NIC-GPU affinity
and dynamic parallel workloads, and (3) distinct optimal partitioning
strategies required for quadratic attention versus linear components. To
address these challenges, we present Zeppelin, a novel training system that
integrates three key techniques: (1) a hierarchical sequence partitioning
method for the attention module that reduces communication overhead and
balances computation, supported by an efficient attention engine that applies
divergent parallel strategies; (2) a routing layer that orchestrates inter-node
transfers to fully utilize NIC bandwidth; and (3) a remapping layer that
transforms sequence layouts between attention and linear modules, ensuring high
computational efficiency across both. Comprehensive evaluations across diverse
configurations show that Zeppelin delivers an average 2.80x speedup over
state-of-the-art methods.

### [3] [Code once, Run Green: Automated Green Code Translation in Serverless Computing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22068)
*Sebastian Werner,Mathis Kähler,Alireza Hakamian*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: 本文提出ReFaaS系统，利用LLM将无服务器函数翻译为更节能的编程语言，可减少高达70%的调用能耗，约3000-5000次调用后实现净节能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 计算基础设施的碳排放问题日益严重，现有节能策略依赖利益相关者干预，难以在已部署系统中实施，导致能源债务持续累积。

Method: 设计并实现ReFaaS系统，集成到Fission无服务器框架中，利用LLM进行代码翻译，评估不同LLM在保持功能正确性的同时提升能源效率的能力。

Result: 翻译后的函数调用能耗降低高达70%，约3000-5000次调用后实现净节能，但并非所有函数都适合翻译，部分函数的摊销阈值较高或无法达到。

Conclusion: 尽管面临挑战，但识别出四个关键研究挑战，解决这些挑战可为无服务器计算中的能源债务提供长期自动化缓解方案。

Abstract: The rapid digitization and the increasing use of emerging technologies such
as AI models have significantly contributed to the emissions of computing
infrastructure. Efforts to mitigate this impact typically focus on the
infrastructure level such as powering data centers with renewable energy, or
through the specific design of energy-efficient software. However, both
strategies rely on stakeholder intervention, making their adoption in legacy
and already-deployed systems unlikely. As a result, past architectural and
implementation decisions continue to incur additional energy usage - a
phenomenon we refer to as energy debt.
  Hence, in this paper, we investigate the potential of serverless computing
platforms to automatically reduce energy debt by leveraging the unique access
to function source code. Specifically, we explore whether large language models
(LLMs) can translate serverless functions into more energy-efficient
programming languages while preserving functional correctness. To this end, we
design and implement ReFaaS and integrate it into the Fission serverless
framework. We evaluate multiple LLMs on their ability to perform such code
translations and analyze their impact on energy consumption.
  Our preliminary results indicate that translated functions can reduce
invocation energy by up to 70%, achieving net energy savings after
approximately 3,000 to 5,000 invocations, depending on the LLM used.
Nonetheless, the approach faces several challenges: not all functions are
suitable for translation, and for some, the amortization threshold is
significantly higher or unreachable. Despite these limitations, we identify
four key research challenges whose resolution could unlock long-term, automated
mitigation of energy debt in serverless computing.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机器学习在科学软件中的应用日益广泛，但硬件加速器的配置和管理面临挑战。AI_INFN项目旨在促进INFN内部ML技术的采用，通过提供AI定制化计算资源支持。

Method: 利用Kubernetes平台，结合Virtual Kubelet和InterLink API的卸载机制，管理跨不同资源提供商（包括LHC计算网格和超级计算机）的工作流。

Conclusion: 该平台为需要专用基础设施的不同工作负载部分提供了一个可行模型，支持ML工作流在分布式计算环境中的开发和扩展。

Abstract: Machine Learning (ML) is driving a revolution in the way scientists design,
develop, and deploy data-intensive software. However, the adoption of ML
presents new challenges for the computing infrastructure, particularly in terms
of provisioning and orchestrating access to hardware accelerators for
development, testing, and production. The INFN-funded project AI_INFN
(Artificial Intelligence at INFN) aims at fostering the adoption of ML
techniques within INFN use cases by providing support on multiple aspects,
including the provisioning of AI-tailored computing resources. It leverages
cloud-native solutions in the context of INFN Cloud, to share hardware
accelerators as effectively as possible, ensuring the diversity of the
Institute's research activities is not compromised. In this contribution, we
provide an update on the commissioning of a Kubernetes platform designed to
ease the development of GPU-powered data analysis workflows and their
scalability on heterogeneous distributed computing resources, also using the
offloading mechanism with Virtual Kubelet and InterLink API. This setup can
manage workflows across different resource providers, including sites of the
Worldwide LHC Computing Grid and supercomputers such as CINECA Leonardo,
providing a model for use cases requiring dedicated infrastructures for
different parts of the workload. Initial test results, emerging case studies,
and integration scenarios will be presented with functional tests and
benchmarks.

### [5] [Orientation does not help with 3-coloring a grid in online-LOCAL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22233)
*Thomas Boudier,Filippo Casagrande,Avinandan Das,Massimo Equi,Henrik Lievonen,Augusto Modanese,Ronja Stimpert*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: 本文证明了在在线LOCAL模型中，即使算法明确获得网格的全局一致方向，3-着色仍然需要Ω(log n)的局部性下界。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 之前关于网格3-着色下界的研究都假设算法无法访问底层网格的方向信息。本文旨在消除这一限制，证明即使算法明确知道网格方向，下界仍然成立。

Method: 通过构建新的证明技术，展示了如何在算法明确知道网格方向的情况下，仍然保持Ω(log n)的局部性下界。

Result: 成功证明了在确定性或随机化的在线LOCAL模型中，网格3-着色需要Ω(log n)的局部性，即使算法拥有网格的全局方向信息。

Conclusion: 网格方向信息的可获得性并不影响3-着色问题的局部性下界，这加强了在线LOCAL模型中对复杂问题求解能力的理解。

Abstract: The online-LOCAL and SLOCAL models are extensions of the LOCAL model where
nodes are processed in a sequential but potentially adversarial order. So far,
the only problem we know of where the global memory of the online-LOCAL model
has an advantage over SLOCAL is 3-coloring bipartite graphs. Recently, Chang et
al. [PODC 2024] showed that even in grids, 3-coloring requires $\Omega(\log n)$
locality in deterministic online-LOCAL. This result was subsequently extended
by Akbari et al. [STOC 2025] to also hold in randomized online-LOCAL. However,
both proofs heavily rely on the assumption that the algorithm does not have
access to the orientation of the underlying grid. In this paper, we show how to
lift this requirement and obtain the same lower bound (against either model)
even when the algorithm is explicitly given a globally consistent orientation
of the grid.

### [6] [SAHM: State-Aware Heterogeneous Multicore for Single-Thread Performance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22405)
*Shayne Wadle,Karthikeyan Sankaralingam*

Main category: cs.PF

TL;DR: SAHM是一种状态感知异构多核架构，通过识别单线程工作负载的16种行为状态，使用专门优化的核心来提升性能，实验显示可实现17%的性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统单线程性能提升方法（如深度推测、宽流水线、复杂乱序执行）面临收益递减问题，需要新的架构设计来突破性能瓶颈。

Method: 通过性能计数器数据定义16种行为状态，设计专门针对特定状态优化的异构核心，并在运行时基于检测到的行为状态进行线程迁移。

Result: 在单线程和多程序场景下，SAHM能够保持核心利用率的同时提升整体性能，实验结果显示可实现17%的性能提升，且对高成本迁移具有鲁棒性（性能下降小于1%）。

Conclusion: 状态感知的核心专业化是提升单线程性能的新途径，能够在避免过高面积、功耗和复杂度成本的情况下实现可组合的微架构增强。

Abstract: Improving single-thread performance remains a critical challenge in modern
processor design, as conventional approaches such as deeper speculation, wider
pipelines, and complex out-of-order execution face diminishing returns. This
work introduces SAHM-State-Aware Heterogeneous Multicore-a novel architecture
that targets performance gains by exploiting fine-grained, time-varying
behavioral diversity in single-threaded workloads. Through empirical
characterization of performance counter data, we define 16 distinct behavioral
states representing different microarchitectural demands. Rather than
over-provisioning a monolithic core with all optimizations, SAHM uses a set of
specialized cores tailored to specific states and migrates threads at runtime
based on detected behavior. This design enables composable microarchitectural
enhancements without incurring prohibitive area, power, or complexity costs.
  We evaluate SAHM in both single-threaded and multiprogrammed scenarios,
demonstrating its ability to maintain core utilization while improving overall
performance through intelligent state-driven scheduling. Experimental results
show opportunity for 17% speed up in realistic scenarios. These speed ups are
robust against high-cost migration, decreasing by less than 1%. Overall,
state-aware core specialization is a new path forward for enhancing
single-thread performance.

*Runhan Xie,Esa Hyytiä,Rhonda Righter*

Main category: cs.PF

TL;DR: 开发了一个流体流模型用于路由问题，其中流体包含不同大小的粒子，目标是通过利用大小信息将流入的流体路由到n个并行服务器以最小化平均延迟。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为离散作业的调度问题提供连续流体模型，将路由问题简化为在n维空间中寻找最优路径来清空系统。

Method: 使用变分法来表征最优策略的结构，并通过数值示例进一步研究流体路由问题。

Result: 成功将路由问题转化为在n维空间中的最优路径问题，并使用变分法分析了最优策略的特性。

Conclusion: 流体模型为大规模分布式服务系统的路由问题提供了有效的分析框架，有助于最优控制策略的设计。

Abstract: We develop a fluid-flow model for routing problems, where fluid consists of
different size particles and the task is to route the incoming fluid to $n$
parallel servers using the size information in order to minimize the mean
latency. The problem corresponds to the dispatching problem of (discrete) jobs
arriving according to a stochastic process. In the fluid model the problem
reduces to finding an optimal path to empty the system in $n$-dimensional
space. We use the calculus of variation to characterize the structure of
optimal policies. Numerical examples shed further light on the fluid routing
problem and the optimal control of large distributed service systems.

Main category: cs.AR

TL;DR: 提出了一种能够实现行星级实时GPU性能分析的系统，解决无性能损失、用户隐私保护和在大规模GPU部署中有效数据收集三大核心问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着GPU应用和硬件复杂度的增加，芯片制造商需要从真实部署环境中收集全面的性能数据来优化芯片设计和应用性能，但现有工具只能提供单个用户级别的数据收集，缺乏更广泛的舰队级分析能力。

Method: 开发了一个系统，能够在100,000个GPU规模的部署中实时收集低层级硬件性能特征数据，同时确保零性能损失和用户隐私保护，通过Torchbench套件应用进行验证。

Result: 模拟10万GPU规模的部署测试表明，该系统成功解决了三个核心问题：无性能损失、隐私保护和在大规模GPU集群中的有效数据收集能力。

Conclusion: 该系统实现了行星级的实时GPU性能分析，为芯片制造商提供了宝贵的舰队级性能数据，同时保障了用户体验和隐私安全。

Abstract: GPUs are the dominant platform for many important applications today
including deep learning, accelerated computing, and scientific simulation.
However, as the complexity of both applications and hardware increases, GPU
chip manufacturers face a significant challenge: how to gather comprehensive
performance characteristics and value profiles from GPUs deployed in real-world
scenarios. Such data, encompassing the types of kernels executed and the time
spent in each, is crucial for optimizing chip design and enhancing application
performance. Unfortunately, despite the availability of low-level tools like
NSYS and NCU, current methodologies fall short, offering data collection
capabilities only on an individual user basis rather than a broader, more
informative fleet-wide scale. This paper takes on the problem of realizing a
system that allows planet-scale real-time GPU performance profiling of
low-level hardware characteristics. The three fundamental problems we solve
are: i) user experience of achieving this with no slowdown; ii) preserving user
privacy, so that no 3rd party is aware of what applications any user runs; iii)
efficacy in showing we are able to collect data and assign it applications even
when run on 1000s of GPUs. Our results simulate a 100,000 size GPU deployment,
running applications from the Torchbench suite, showing our system addresses
all 3 problems.

Conclusion: 该框架为微处理器设计提供了高效、准确的评估方法，能够在现有硬件上仿真未来设计，显著提升设计验证效率。

Abstract: The evaluation of new microprocessor designs is constrained by slow,
cycle-accurate simulators that rely on unrepresentative benchmark traces. This
paper introduces a novel deep learning framework for high-fidelity,
``in-the-wild'' simulation on production hardware. Our core contribution is a
DL model trained on microarchitecture-independent features to predict
cycle-level performance for hypothetical processor designs. This unique
approach allows the model to be deployed on existing silicon to evaluate future
hardware. We propose a complete system featuring a lightweight hardware trace
collector and a principled sampling strategy to minimize user impact. This
system achieves a simulation speed of 5 MIPS on a commodity GPU, imposing a
mere 0.1% performance overhead. Furthermore, our co-designed Neutrino on-chip
accelerator improves performance by 85x over the GPU. We demonstrate that this
framework enables accurate performance analysis and large-scale hardware A/B
testing on a massive scale using real-world applications.

TL;DR: AxLLM是一种针对量化大语言模型的硬件加速器架构，通过消除冗余计算实现高效部署


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型需要大量计算和内存资源，部署效率面临挑战。量化不仅减小模型规模，还能增加参数局部性，为计算重用创造机会

Method: 提出AxLLM硬件加速器架构，采用新颖的冗余消除技术，缓存并重用重复权重值的乘法结果。架构包含双乘法和重用流水线，支持基础模型和LoRA微调模型

Result: 实验结果显示，AxLLM最高减少90%计算量，能耗降低28%，速度提升1.7倍

Conclusion: AxLLM是专用于加速大语言模型的可扩展高效硬件解决方案

Abstract: Large language models demand massive computational power and memory
resources, posing significant challenges for efficient deployment. While
quantization has been widely explored to reduce model size and computation,
this paper demonstrates an additional benefit: quantization increases parameter
locality, creating opportunities for computation reuse. Building on this
insight, we propose AxLLM, a hardware accelerator architecture designed for
quantized models. Axllm introduces a novel redundancy elimination technique
that caches and reuses multiplication results for repeated weight values,
substantially reducing redundant operations. The architecture features dual
multiply and reuse pipelines, efficiently supporting both base models and LoRA
fine-tuned models without altering parameters, retraining, or requiring offline
preprocessing. Experimental results show that AxLLM achieves up to 90%
reduction in computations, delivering 28% lower energy consumption and a 1.7x
speedup over baseline execution. These results highlight Axllm as a scalable
and efficient solution for accelerating LLMs on specialized hardware.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决食品零售业中的食物浪费问题，通过优化供应策略与客户购买行为之间的平衡来防止过度供应导致的浪费和产品短缺。

Method: 首先从杂货店销售数据中发现连续时间马尔可夫链形式的随机过程模型，然后扩展供应活动，最后进行假设分析评估产品数量随时间的变化。

Result: 能够识别客户购买行为和供应策略之间的最优平衡，有效防止因过度供应导致的食物浪费和产品短缺。

Conclusion: 该方法为食品零售业提供了有效的工具来优化库存管理和减少食物浪费，实现了供需平衡的精确控制。

Abstract: This paper proposes a novel method for analyzing food retail processes with a
focus on reducing food waste. The approach integrates object-centric process
mining (OCPM) with stochastic process discovery and analysis. First, a
stochastic process in the form of a continuous-time Markov chain is discovered
from grocery store sales data. This model is then extended with supply
activities. Finally, a what-if analysis is conducted to evaluate how the
quantity of products in the store evolves over time. This enables the
identification of an optimal balance between customer purchasing behavior and
supply strategies, helping to prevent both food waste due to oversupply and
product shortages.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了两种基于维度分析的权重方案来改进物理信息神经网络(PINNs)的训练稳定性，其中第二种方案结合了可量化和不可量化项，在多个CFD基准测试中表现出更好的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 物理信息神经网络在求解偏微分方程时对损失权重选择高度敏感，传统方法难以在高Peclet数对流扩散等复杂问题中获得稳定准确的结果。

Method: 提出了两种基于维度分析的权重方案：第一种仅基于可量化项，第二种同时结合可量化和不可量化项，实现更平衡的训练过程。

Result: 在热传导、对流扩散和顶盖驱动腔流等基准测试中，第二种方案相比等权重方法显著提高了稳定性和准确性，特别是在高Peclet数对流扩散问题中实现了传统求解器无法达到的稳定准确预测。

Conclusion: 所提出的权重方案增强了PINNs在计算流体动力学问题中的鲁棒性和泛化能力，为复杂物理问题的求解提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Physics Informed Neural Networks offer a mesh free framework for solving PDEs
but are highly sensitive to loss weight selection. We propose two dimensional
analysis based weighting schemes, one based on quantifiable terms, and another
also incorporating unquantifiable terms for more balanced training. Benchmarks
on heat conduction, convection diffusion, and lid driven cavity flows show that
the second scheme consistently improves stability and accuracy over equal
weighting. Notably, in high Peclet number convection diffusion, where
traditional solvers fail, PINNs with our scheme achieve stable, accurate
predictions, highlighting their robustness and generalizability in CFD

*Rushil Gupta,Jason Hartford,Bang Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 评估LLMs作为实验设计代理的能力，发现当前模型对实验反馈不敏感，无法进行上下文实验设计，提出结合LLM先验知识和最近邻采样的混合方法LLMNN


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 验证LLMs是否真能作为通用实验设计代理执行上下文实验设计，并评估其在遗传扰动和分子属性发现任务中的表现

Method: 使用开源和闭源指令调优LLMs，比较传统方法（线性赌博机、高斯过程优化）与LLM代理的性能，提出LLMNN混合方法

Result: LLM代理对实验反馈不敏感，真实结果与随机标签替换对性能无影响；传统方法在所有基准测试中均优于LLM代理；LLMNN方法在不同领域实现竞争性或更优性能

Conclusion: 当前LLMs无法在实践中执行上下文实验设计，需要将基于先验的推理与具有更新后验的批量获取解耦的混合框架

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have recently been proposed as general-purpose
agents for experimental design, with claims that they can perform in-context
experimental design. We evaluate this hypothesis using both open- and
closed-source instruction-tuned LLMs applied to genetic perturbation and
molecular property discovery tasks. We find that LLM-based agents show no
sensitivity to experimental feedback: replacing true outcomes with randomly
permuted labels has no impact on performance. Across benchmarks, classical
methods such as linear bandits and Gaussian process optimization consistently
outperform LLM agents. We further propose a simple hybrid method, LLM-guided
Nearest Neighbour (LLMNN) sampling, that combines LLM prior knowledge with
nearest-neighbor sampling to guide the design of experiments. LLMNN achieves
competitive or superior performance across domains without requiring
significant in-context adaptation. These results suggest that current open- and
closed-source LLMs do not perform in-context experimental design in practice
and highlight the need for hybrid frameworks that decouple prior-based
reasoning from batch acquisition with updated posteriors.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出一种动态切换训练方法，在ViT-Large模型训练早期阶段从全参数训练切换到低秩适应(LoRA)，显著减少可训练参数和资源消耗


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型模型训练资源消耗巨大，且观察到大部分学习发生在训练早期阶段，后期权重变化趋于稳定，可用低秩矩阵表示

Method: 通过用户定义超参数确定切换点，根据各模块层的收敛程度分配特定秩，动态从全参数训练切换到LoRA

Result: 将可训练参数减少到原来的10%，吞吐量提升3倍，每轮平均训练时间减少1.5倍，GPU内存消耗降低20%，同时保持模型精度

Conclusion: 该方法能有效降低大型模型训练的资源需求，在保持性能的同时显著提升训练效率

Abstract: Training large models ranging from millions to billions of parameters is
highly resource-intensive, requiring significant time, compute, and memory. It
is observed that most of the learning (higher change in weights) takes place in
the earlier stage of the training loop. These changes stabilize as training
continues, enabling them to be captured by matrices of a low intrinsic rank.
Therefore, we propose an approach to identify such states of partial
convergence and dynamically switch from full parameter training to Low-Rank
Adaptation (LoRA) on the ViT-Large model. We introduce a flexible approach that
leverages user-defined hyperparameters to determine the switching point and
assign a rank specific to each module layer based on its level of convergence.
Experimental results show that this approach preserves model accuracy while
reducing the number of trainable parameters to 10% of its original size,
resulting in a 3x improvement in throughput, and a 1.5x reduction in average
training time per epoch while also reducing GPU memory consumption by 20%

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决数据自由持续模型融合中的核心挑战：如何在参数空间优化中确保对先前任务的透明性和对新任务的保真度，而无需访问任务数据。

Method: 提出零空间过滤器和LoRA适配器的联合方法，前者通过过滤新任务向量中的重叠分量确保透明性，后者通过投影替代损失训练适配器实现保真度。

Result: 在视觉和NLP基准测试中达到最先进性能，平均准确率比OPCM和WUDI-Merging提高4-7%，同时减少遗忘和计算开销。

Conclusion: NUFILT通过结构替代方法有效连接数据级期望与参数空间优化，为数据自由持续模型融合提供了理论保证和实用解决方案。

Abstract: Data-free continual model merging (DFCMM) aims to fuse independently
fine-tuned models into a single backbone that evolves with incoming tasks
without accessing task data. This paper formulate two fundamental desiderata
for DFCMM: transparency, avoiding interference with earlier tasks, and
fidelity, adapting faithfully to each new task. This poses a challenge that
existing approaches fail to address: how to bridge data-level desiderata with
parameter-space optimization to ensure transparency and fidelity in the absence
of task data. To this end, we propose NUFILT (NUll-space FILTering), a
data-free framework that directly links these desiderata to optimization. Our
key observation is that task vectors approximately align with representation
subspaces, providing structural surrogates for enforcing transparency and
fidelity. Accordingly, we design a null-space projector that preserves prior
responses by filtering out overlapping components of new task vectors, thereby
ensuring transparency, and a lightweight LoRA adapter that injects
complementary task-specific signals, enabling fidelity in adapting to new
tasks. The adapter is trained with a projection-based surrogate loss to retain
consistency with previous knowledge while introducing novel directions. This
joint filtering-adaptation process allows the backbone to absorb new knowledge
while retaining existing behaviors, and the updates are finally fused back in a
layer-wise linear fashion without extra parameters or inference cost.
Theoretically, we establish approximate subspace alignment guarantees that
justify null-space filtering. Empirically, NUFILT achieves state-of-the-art
performance with minimal forgetting on both vision and NLP benchmarks,
improving average accuracy by 4-7% over OPCM and WUDI-Merging, while narrowing
the gap to fine-tuning and reducing computation overhead.

TL;DR: 提出了一种联邦多模态钓鱼网站检测器，支持URL、HTML和图像输入，采用基于角色的桶聚合方法，通过硬门控选择模态专家，实现稳定的联邦训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发一个支持多模态输入且不绑定客户端固定模式的钓鱼检测系统，在严格隐私保护下实现稳定的联邦学习训练。

Method: 在FedProx基础上提出基于角色的桶聚合，借鉴混合专家和FedMM思想，使用硬门控选择模态专家，分离聚合模态特定参数以避免跨嵌入冲突。

Result: 在TR-OP数据集上，融合头达到97.5%准确率和2.4%误报率；图像子集达到95.5%准确率和5.9%误报率；WebPhish数据集达到96.5%准确率和1.8%误报率。

Conclusion: 桶聚合与硬门控专家能够在严格隐私保护下实现稳定的联邦训练，同时提高多模态钓鱼检测的可用性和灵活性。

Abstract: We present a federated, multi-modal phishing website detector that supports
URL, HTML, and IMAGE inputs without binding clients to a fixed modality at
inference: any client can invoke any modality head trained elsewhere.
Methodologically, we propose role-aware bucket aggregation on top of FedProx,
inspired by Mixture-of-Experts and FedMM. We drop learnable routing and use
hard gating (selecting the IMAGE/HTML/URL expert by sample modality), enabling
separate aggregation of modality-specific parameters to isolate cross-embedding
conflicts and stabilize convergence. On TR-OP, the Fusion head reaches Acc
97.5% with FPR 2.4% across two data types; on the image subset (ablation) it
attains Acc 95.5% with FPR 5.9%. For text, we use GraphCodeBERT for URLs and an
early three-way embedding for raw, noisy HTML. On WebPhish (HTML) we obtain Acc
96.5% / FPR 1.8%; on TR-OP (raw HTML) we obtain Acc 95.1% / FPR 4.6%. Results
indicate that bucket aggregation with hard-gated experts enables stable
federated training under strict privacy, while improving the usability and
flexibility of multi-modal phishing detection.

Method: 在自回归设置下训练Transformer模型，直接从波形数据学习时空依赖性，处理单站和阵列输入。

Result: 模型在即时预测窗口内表现良好，随着预测时间延长性能逐渐下降，符合自回归系统的预期行为。

Conclusion: 该方法为数据驱动的地震预测奠定了基础，有望支持引力波探测器的噪声抑制和实时控制。

Abstract: We introduce \textit{SeismoGPT}, a transformer-based model for forecasting
three-component seismic waveforms in the context of future gravitational wave
detectors like the Einstein Telescope. The model is trained in an
autoregressive setting and can operate on both single-station and array-based
inputs. By learning temporal and spatial dependencies directly from waveform
data, SeismoGPT captures realistic ground motion patterns and provides accurate
short-term forecasts. Our results show that the model performs well within the
immediate prediction window and gradually degrades further ahead, as expected
in autoregressive systems. This approach lays the groundwork for data-driven
seismic forecasting that could support Newtonian noise mitigation and real-time
observatory control.

Conclusion: 基于推理的LLM决策树生成方法为小样本表格问题提供了可解释的解决方案，允许人工检查和纠正，平衡了性能与透明度。

Abstract: Tabular foundation models are becoming increasingly popular for low-resource
tabular problems. These models make up for small training datasets by
pretraining on large volumes of synthetic data. The prior knowledge obtained
via pretraining provides the exceptional performance, but the resulting model
becomes a black box that is difficult to interpret and costly to inference. In
this work, we explore an alternative strategy: using reasoning-capable LLMs to
induce decision trees for small tabular datasets in agentic setup. We design a
minimal set of tools for constructing, analyzing and manipulating decision
trees. By using these tools, LLMs combine their prior knowledge with learning
from data to create a lightweight decision tree that outperforms traditional
CART on low-resource tabular problems. While a single decision tree does not
outperform state-of-the-art black box models, it comes with a human-readable
reasoning trace that can be checked for biases and data leaks. Furthermore, the
reasoning-based LLM's creation process allows for additional human input:
correcting biases or incorporating domain-specific intuition that is not
captured in the data.

Abstract: Idempotent generative networks (IGNs) are a new line of generative models
based on idempotent mapping to a target manifold. IGNs support both single-and
multi-step generation, allowing for a flexible trade-off between computational
cost and sample quality. But similar to Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs),
conventional IGNs require adversarial training and are prone to training
instabilities and mode collapse. Diffusion and score-based models are popular
approaches to generative modeling that iteratively transport samples from one
distribution, usually a Gaussian, to a target data distribution. These models
have gained popularity due to their stable training dynamics and high-fidelity
generation quality. However, this stability and quality come at the cost of
high computational cost, as the data must be transported incrementally along
the entire trajectory. New sampling methods, model distillation, and
consistency models have been developed to reduce the sampling cost and even
perform one-shot sampling from diffusion models. In this work, we unite
diffusion and IGNs by distilling idempotent models from diffusion model scores,
called SIGN. Our proposed method is highly stable and does not require
adversarial losses. We provide a theoretical analysis of our proposed
score-based training methods and empirically show that IGNs can be effectively
distilled from a pre-trained diffusion model, enabling faster inference than
iterative score-based models. SIGNs can perform multi-step sampling, allowing
users to trade off quality for efficiency. These models operate directly on the
source domain; they can project corrupted or alternate distributions back onto
the target manifold, enabling zero-shot editing of inputs. We validate our
models on multiple image datasets, achieving state-of-the-art results for
idempotent models on the CIFAR and CelebA datasets.

Result: 证明了即使是最优估计器也会产生幻觉，并给出了幻觉率的通用概率下界。

Conclusion: 幻觉是损失最小化与人类期望输出之间的结构性错配导致的校准错误问题。

Abstract: We formalize hallucinations in generative models as failures to link an
estimate to any plausible cause. Under this interpretation, we show that even
loss-minimizing optimal estimators still hallucinate. We confirm this with a
general high probability lower bound on hallucinate rate for generic data
distributions. This reframes hallucination as structural misalignment between
loss minimization and human-acceptable outputs, and hence estimation errors
induced by miscalibration. Experiments on coin aggregation, open-ended QA, and
text-to-image support our theory.

Conclusion: d2框架有效提升了扩散语言模型的推理能力，证明了掩码扩散模型在推理任务中的潜力。

Abstract: While diffusion language models (DLMs) have achieved competitive performance
in text generation, improving their reasoning ability with reinforcement
learning remains an active research area. Here, we introduce d2, a reasoning
framework tailored for masked DLMs. Central to our framework is a new policy
gradient algorithm that relies on properties of masking to accurately estimate
the likelihoods of sampling trajectories. Our estimators trade off computation
for approximation accuracy in an analytically tractable manner, and are
particularly effective for DLMs that support any-order likelihood estimation.
We characterize and study this property in popular DLMs and show that it is key
for efficient diffusion-based reasoning. Empirically, d2 significantly improves
over previous diffusion reasoning frameworks using only RL (without relying on
supervised fine-tuning), and sets a new state-of-the-art performance for DLMs
on logical reasoning tasks (Countdown and Sudoku) and math reasoning benchmarks
(GSM8K and MATH500).

Abstract: Reconstructing subsurface ocean dynamics, such as vertical velocity fields,
from incomplete surface observations poses a critical challenge in Earth
science, a field long hampered by the lack of standardized, analysis-ready
benchmarks. To systematically address this issue and catalyze research, we
first build and release KD48, a high-resolution ocean dynamics benchmark
derived from petascale simulations and curated with expert-driven denoising.
Building on this benchmark, we introduce VISION, a novel reconstruction
paradigm based on Dynamic Prompting designed to tackle the core problem of
missing data in real-world observations. The essence of VISION lies in its
ability to generate a visual prompt on-the-fly from any available subset of
observations, which encodes both data availability and the ocean's physical
state. More importantly, we design a State-conditioned Prompting module that
efficiently injects this prompt into a universal backbone, endowed with
geometry- and scale-aware operators, to guide its adaptive adjustment of
computational strategies. This mechanism enables VISION to precisely handle the
challenges posed by varying input combinations. Extensive experiments on the
KD48 benchmark demonstrate that VISION not only substantially outperforms
state-of-the-art models but also exhibits strong generalization under extreme
data missing scenarios. By providing a high-quality benchmark and a robust
model, our work establishes a solid infrastructure for ocean science research
under data uncertainty. Our codes are available at:

Abstract: With promising empirical performance across a wide range of applications,
synthetic data augmentation appears a viable solution to data scarcity and the
demands of increasingly data-intensive models. Its effectiveness lies in
expanding the training set in a way that reduces estimator variance while
introducing only minimal bias. Controlling this bias is therefore critical:
effective data augmentation should generate diverse samples from the same
underlying distribution as the training set, with minimal shifts. In this
paper, we propose conformal data augmentation, a principled data filtering
framework that leverages the power of conformal prediction to produce diverse
synthetic data while filtering out poor-quality generations with provable risk
control. Our method is simple to implement, requires no access to internal
model logits, nor large-scale model retraining. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of our approach across multiple tasks, including topic
prediction, sentiment analysis, image classification, and fraud detection,
showing consistent performance improvements of up to 40% in F1 score over
unaugmented baselines, and 4% over other filtered augmentation baselines.

Result: FedZero在联邦凸设置下以高概率实现接近最优的优化误差界限；在单工作器场景中建立了凸零阶优化的首个高概率收敛保证。

Conclusion: FedZero提供了具有严格理论保证的联邦零阶优化方法，其开发的集中不等式工具不仅对算法分析至关重要，也具有独立的研究价值。

Abstract: We study distributed learning in the setting of gradient-free zero-order
optimization and introduce FedZero, a federated zero-order algorithm that
delivers sharp theoretical guarantees. Specifically, FedZero: (1) achieves
near-optimal optimization error bounds with high probability in the federated
convex setting; and (2) in the single-worker regime-where the problem reduces
to the standard zero-order framework, establishes the first high-probability
convergence guarantees for convex zero-order optimization, thereby
strengthening the classical expectation-based results. At its core, FedZero
employs a gradient estimator based on randomization over the $\ell_1$-sphere.
To analyze it, we develop new concentration inequalities for Lipschitz
functions under the uniform measure on the $\ell_1$-sphere, with explicit
constants. These concentration tools are not only central to our
high-probability guarantees but may also be of independent interest.

Abstract: This paper presents a method for modeling transient fluid flow in subsurface
reservoir systems based on the developed neural operator architecture
(TFNO-opt). Reservoir systems are complex dynamic objects with distributed
parameters described by systems of partial differential equations (PDEs).
Traditional numerical methods for modeling such systems, despite their high
accuracy, are characterized by significant time costs for performing
calculations, which limits their applicability in control and decision support
problems. The proposed architecture (TFNO-opt) is based on Fourier neural
operators, which allow approximating PDE solutions in infinite-dimensional
functional spaces, providing invariance to discretization and the possibility
of generalization to various implementations of equations. The developed
modifications are aimed at increasing the accuracy and stability of the trained
neural operator, which is especially important for control problems. These
include adjustable internal time resolution of the integral Fourier operator,
tensor decomposition of parameters in the spectral domain, use of the Sobolev
norm in the error function, and separation of approximation errors and
reconstruction of initial conditions for more accurate reproduction of physical
processes. The effectiveness of the proposed improvements is confirmed by
computational experiments. The practical significance is confirmed by
computational experiments using the example of the problem of hydrodynamic
modeling of an underground gas storage (UGS), where the acceleration of
calculations by six orders of magnitude was achieved, compared to traditional
methods. This opens up new opportunities for the effective control of complex
reservoir systems.

Abstract: Foundation models pretrained on large-scale datasets have transformed such
fields as natural language processing and computer vision, but their
application to graph data remains limited. Recently emerged graph foundation
models, such as G2T-FM, utilize tabular foundation models for graph tasks and
were shown to significantly outperform prior attempts to create GFMs. However,
these models primarily rely on hand-crafted graph features, limiting their
ability to learn complex graph-specific patterns. In this work, we propose
GraphPFN: a prior-data fitted network for node-level prediction. First, we
design a prior distribution of synthetic attributed graphs. For graph structure
generation, we use a novel combination of multiple stochastic block models and
a preferential attachment process. We then apply graph-aware structured causal
models to generate node attributes and targets. This procedure allows us to
efficiently generate a wide range of realistic graph datasets. Then, we augment
the tabular foundation model LimiX with attention-based graph neighborhood
aggregation layers and train it on synthetic graphs sampled from our prior,
allowing the model to capture graph structural dependencies not present in
tabular data. On diverse real-world graph datasets with up to 50,000 nodes,
GraphPFN shows strong in-context learning performance and achieves
state-of-the-art results after finetuning, outperforming both G2T-FM and
task-specific GNNs trained from scratch on most datasets. More broadly, our
work demonstrates that pretraining on synthetic graphs from a well-designed
prior distribution is an effective strategy for building graph foundation
models.

Conclusion: 这是首个基于闭式解、激活指导的扩散模型结构压缩方法，完全无需训练，提供了理论清晰性和实际效率。

Abstract: Diffusion models (DMs), lauded for their generative performance, are
computationally prohibitive due to their billion-scale parameters and iterative
denoising dynamics. Existing efficiency techniques, such as quantization,
timestep reduction, or pruning, offer savings in compute, memory, or runtime
but are strictly bottlenecked by reliance on fine-tuning or retraining to
recover performance. In this work, we introduce SlimDiff, an automated
activation-informed structural compression framework that reduces both
attention and feedforward dimensionalities in DMs, while being entirely
gradient-free. SlimDiff reframes DM compression as a spectral approximation
task, where activation covariances across denoising timesteps define low-rank
subspaces that guide dynamic pruning under a fixed compression budget. This
activation-aware formulation mitigates error accumulation across timesteps by
applying module-wise decompositions over functional weight groups: query--key
interactions, value--output couplings, and feedforward projections, rather than
isolated matrix factorizations, while adaptively allocating sparsity across
modules to respect the non-uniform geometry of diffusion trajectories. SlimDiff
achieves up to 35\% acceleration and $\sim$100M parameter reduction over
baselines, with generation quality on par with uncompressed models without any
backpropagation. Crucially, our approach requires only about 500 calibration
samples, over 70$\times$ fewer than prior methods. To our knowledge, this is
the first closed-form, activation-guided structural compression of DMs that is
entirely training-free, providing both theoretical clarity and practical
efficiency.

Result: 实证研究表明基于评分标准的奖励显著缓解了奖励过度优化问题，并实现了有效的LLM后训练改进。

Conclusion: 基于评分标准的奖励机制是解决强化微调中奖励过度优化问题的有效方法，能够更好地捕捉高奖励尾部的质量差异。

Abstract: Reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT) often suffers from \emph{reward
over-optimization}, where a policy model hacks the reward signals to achieve
high scores while producing low-quality outputs. Our theoretical analysis shows
that the key lies in reward misspecification at the high-reward tail: the
inability to reliably distinguish Excellent responses from merely Great ones.
This motivate us to focus on the high-reward region. However, such tail
examples are scarce under the base LLM. While off-policy exemplars (e.g. from
stronger models or rewrites) are easier to obtain, naively training on them
yields a misspecified reward for the policy we aim to align. To address this,
we study rubric-based rewards. By design, rubrics can leverage off-policy
examples while remaining insensitive to their artifacts. To elicit rubrics that
capture the high-reward tail, we highlight the importance of distinguishing
among great and diverse responses, and introduce a workflow to implement this
idea. We empirically demonstrate that rubric-based rewards substantially
mitigate reward over-optimization and deliver effective LLM post-training
improvements. Our code can be accessed at

Abstract: Learning representations that transfer well to diverse downstream tasks
remains a central challenge in representation learning. Existing paradigms --
contrastive learning, self-supervised masking, and denoising auto-encoders --
balance this challenge with different trade-offs. We introduce the {contrastive
Mutual Information Machine} (cMIM), a probabilistic framework that extends the
Mutual Information Machine (MIM) with a contrastive objective. While MIM
maximizes mutual information between inputs and latents and promotes clustering
of codes, it falls short on discriminative tasks. cMIM addresses this gap by
imposing global discriminative structure while retaining MIM's generative
fidelity. Our contributions are threefold. First, we propose cMIM, a
contrastive extension of MIM that removes the need for positive data
augmentation and is substantially less sensitive to batch size than InfoNCE.
Second, we introduce {informative embeddings}, a general technique for
extracting enriched features from encoder-decoder models that boosts
discriminative performance without additional training and applies broadly
beyond MIM. Third, we provide empirical evidence across vision and molecular
benchmarks showing that cMIM outperforms MIM and InfoNCE on classification and
regression tasks while preserving competitive reconstruction quality. These
results position cMIM as a unified framework for representation learning,
advancing the goal of models that serve both discriminative and generative
applications effectively.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DistillKac是一种快速图像生成器，使用阻尼波动方程及其随机Kac表示，以有限速度移动概率质量。相比扩散模型，它确保有限速度传输和全局有界动能，并通过端点蒸馏实现高质量样本生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型的反向时间速度可能变得僵硬并隐含允许无界传播速度，而Kac动力学强制有限速度传输并产生全局有界动能，提供更好的数值稳定性。

Method: 使用阻尼波动方程和随机Kac表示；引入速度空间的分类器自由引导；提出端点蒸馏方法，训练学生模型在长区间内匹配冻结的教师模型。

Result: 实验证明DistillKac能够以极少的函数评估次数生成高质量样本，同时保持有限速度概率流的数值稳定性优势。

Conclusion: DistillKac结合了有限速度传输的理论优势和端点蒸馏的实践效率，在保持数值稳定性的同时实现了快速高质量的图像生成。

Abstract: We present DistillKac, a fast image generator that uses the damped wave
equation and its stochastic Kac representation to move probability mass at
finite speed. In contrast to diffusion models whose reverse time velocities can
become stiff and implicitly allow unbounded propagation speed, Kac dynamics
enforce finite speed transport and yield globally bounded kinetic energy.
Building on this structure, we introduce classifier-free guidance in velocity
space that preserves square integrability under mild conditions. We then
propose endpoint only distillation that trains a student to match a frozen
teacher over long intervals. We prove a stability result that promotes
supervision at the endpoints to closeness along the entire path. Experiments
demonstrate DistillKac delivers high quality samples with very few function
evaluations while retaining the numerical stability benefits of finite speed
probability flows.

Abstract: The main focus of research on Knowledge Tracing (KT) models is on model
developments with the aim of improving predictive accuracy. Most of these
models make the most incorrect predictions when students choose a distractor,
leading to student errors going undetected. We present an approach to add new
capabilities to KT models by capturing predictive uncertainty and demonstrate
that a larger predictive uncertainty aligns with model incorrect predictions.
We show that uncertainty in KT models is informative and that this signal would
be pedagogically useful for application in an educational learning platform
that can be used in a limited resource setting where understanding student
ability is necessary.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一个名为Li₂的数学框架，用于分析两层非线性网络中的grokking现象，揭示了梯度动态的三个关键阶段：惰性学习、独立特征学习和交互特征学习。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然grokking现象已被广泛研究，但缺乏一个数学框架来系统描述复杂结构化输入中特征如何出现、如何发展以及在什么条件下发生。

Method: 通过分析反向传播梯度GF的结构变化来表征三个学习阶段：GF随机时的惰性学习；GF携带标签信息且每个节点独立学习时的独立特征学习；以及节点交互学习缺失特征时的交互特征学习。

Result: 发现独立动态遵循能量函数E的梯度上升，其局部最大值正是涌现的特征。在群算术任务中研究了这些特征的可泛化性、表示能力及其随样本大小的变化。

Conclusion: 该研究阐明了权重衰减、学习率和样本大小等超参数在grokking中的作用，推导了记忆和泛化的可证明缩放规律，并从梯度动态的第一性原理揭示了Muon等优化器有效性的根本原因。

Abstract: While the phenomenon of grokking, i.e., delayed generalization, has been
studied extensively, it remains an open question whether there is a
mathematical framework to characterize what kind of features emerge, how and in
which conditions it happens from training, for complex structured inputs. We
propose a novel framework, named $\mathbf{Li_2}$, that captures three key
stages for the grokking behavior of 2-layer nonlinear networks: (I) Lazy
learning, (II) independent feature learning and (III) interactive feature
learning, characterized by the structure of backpropagated gradient $G_F$
across layers. In (I), $G_F$ is random, and top layer overfits to random hidden
representation. In (II), the gradient of each node (column of $G_F$) only
depends on its own activation, and thus each hidden node learns their
representation independently from $G_F$, which now carries information about
target labels, thanks to weight decay. Interestingly, the independent dynamics
follows exactly the gradient ascent of an energy function $E$, and its local
maxima are precisely the emerging features. We study whether these local-optima
induced features are generalizable, their representation power, and how they
change on sample size, in group arithmetic tasks. Finally, in (III), we
provably show how hidden nodes interact, and how $G_F$ changes to focus on
missing features that need to be learned. Our study sheds lights on roles
played by key hyperparameters such as weight decay, learning rate and sample
sizes in grokking, leads to provable scaling laws of memorization and
generalization, and reveals the underlying cause why recent optimizers such as
Muon can be effective, from the first principles of gradient dynamics. Our
analysis can be extended to multi-layer architectures.

TL;DR: TRiCo是一个新颖的三元博弈论协同训练框架，通过将教师、两个学生和一个对抗生成器整合到统一训练范式中，重新思考半监督学习的结构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有半监督学习框架的关键限制，如静态视图交互、不可靠的伪标签以及缺乏困难样本建模，提供原则性和可推广的解决方案。

Method: 将SSL形式化为三个角色之间的结构化交互：两个在冻结互补表示上训练的学生分类器、一个通过验证反馈自适应调节伪标签选择和损失平衡的元学习教师，以及一个扰动嵌入以揭示决策边界弱点的非参数生成器。伪标签基于互信息而非置信度选择，提供更稳健的认知不确定性度量。这种三元交互被形式化为Stackelberg博弈。

Result: 在CIFAR-10、SVHN、STL-10和ImageNet上的广泛实验表明，TRiCo在低标签情况下始终达到最先进的性能，同时保持架构无关性并与冻结视觉骨干兼容。

Conclusion: TRiCo通过三元博弈论框架为半监督学习提供了原则性和可推广的解决方案，在多个基准数据集上实现了最先进的性能。

Abstract: We introduce TRiCo, a novel triadic game-theoretic co-training framework that
rethinks the structure of semi-supervised learning by incorporating a teacher,
two students, and an adversarial generator into a unified training paradigm.
Unlike existing co-training or teacher-student approaches, TRiCo formulates SSL
as a structured interaction among three roles: (i) two student classifiers
trained on frozen, complementary representations, (ii) a meta-learned teacher
that adaptively regulates pseudo-label selection and loss balancing via
validation-based feedback, and (iii) a non-parametric generator that perturbs
embeddings to uncover decision boundary weaknesses. Pseudo-labels are selected
based on mutual information rather than confidence, providing a more robust
measure of epistemic uncertainty. This triadic interaction is formalized as a
Stackelberg game, where the teacher leads strategy optimization and students
follow under adversarial perturbations. By addressing key limitations in
existing SSL frameworks, such as static view interactions, unreliable
pseudo-labels, and lack of hard sample modeling, TRiCo provides a principled
and generalizable solution. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10, SVHN, STL-10,
and ImageNet demonstrate that TRiCo consistently achieves state-of-the-art
performance in low-label regimes, while remaining architecture-agnostic and
compatible with frozen vision backbones.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: BRT-Align是一个基于可达性分析的LLM安全对齐框架，在推理时通过可达性分析预测不安全生成，并提供运行时监控和最小干预的转向机制


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前主流的安全方法RLHF只在训练时有效，在推理时无法防止不安全内容的生成，需要一种推理时的安全保障机制

Method: 将自回归生成建模为潜在空间中的动态系统，通过后向可达性学习安全价值函数，实现运行时监控和最小限制的转向过滤

Result: 在多个LLM和毒性基准测试中，BRT-Align比基线方法更准确、更早地检测不安全延续，显著减少不安全生成，同时保持句子多样性和连贯性

Conclusion: 可达性分析为推理时LLM安全提供了原则性和实用的基础

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are now ubiquitous in everyday tools, raising
urgent safety concerns about their tendency to generate harmful content. The
dominant safety approach -- reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF)
-- effectively shapes model behavior during training but offers no safeguards
at inference time, where unsafe continuations may still arise. We propose
BRT-Align, a reachability-based framework that brings control-theoretic safety
tools to LLM inference. BRT-Align models autoregressive generation as a
dynamical system in latent space and learn a safety value function via backward
reachability, estimating the worst-case evolution of a trajectory. This enables
two complementary mechanisms: (1) a runtime monitor that forecasts unsafe
completions several tokens in advance, and (2) a least-restrictive steering
filter that minimally perturbs latent states to redirect generation away from
unsafe regions. Experiments across multiple LLMs and toxicity benchmarks
demonstrate that BRT-Align provides more accurate and earlier detection of
unsafe continuations than baselines. Moreover, for LLM safety alignment,
BRT-Align substantially reduces unsafe generations while preserving sentence
diversity and coherence. Qualitative results further highlight emergent
alignment properties: BRT-Align consistently produces responses that are less
violent, less profane, less offensive, and less politically biased. Together,
these findings demonstrate that reachability analysis provides a principled and
practical foundation for inference-time LLM safety.

Abstract: Data augmentation is a widely used strategy to improve model robustness and
generalization by enriching training datasets with synthetic examples. While
large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong generative capabilities
for this purpose, their applications in high-stakes domains like healthcare
present unique challenges due to the risk of generating clinically incorrect or
misleading information. In this work, we propose a novel query-based model
collaboration framework that integrates expert-level domain knowledge to guide
the augmentation process to preserve critical medical information. Experiments
on clinical prediction tasks demonstrate that our lightweight
collaboration-based approach consistently outperforms existing LLM augmentation
methods while improving safety through reduced factual errors. This framework
addresses the gap between LLM augmentation potential and the safety
requirements of specialized domains.

TL;DR: 本文研究了LLM中的归纳头如何支持上下文学习，特别是处理具有层次结构的复杂重复模式。研究发现存在自适应归纳头，能够学习在上下文中关注什么内容，并且这种学习受到揭示潜在上下文的注意力头的支持。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然已知归纳头在Transformer语言模型的上下文学习中起关键作用，但尚不清楚这种机制是否能支持具有层次结构的复杂重复模式的上下文学习。自然语言中存在大量此类情况，需要整合上下文线索来预测正确的后继标记。

Method: 设计了一个合成的上下文学习任务，其中标记以层次依赖关系重复出现。评估了一系列LLM在这些标记序列和自然语言类似物上的表现，并研究了归纳头本身如何在上下文中学习。

Result: 发现了支持预测的自适应归纳头，它们能够学习在上下文中关注什么内容。学习受到揭示一组潜在上下文的注意力头的支持，这些上下文决定了不同的标记转换关系。

Conclusion: 不仅证明了LLM具有学习的归纳头，而且提供了关于LLM如何在上下文中学习预测高阶重复模式的完整机制解释。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at in-context learning, the ability to use
information provided as context to improve prediction of future tokens.
Induction heads have been argued to play a crucial role for in-context learning
in Transformer Language Models. These attention heads make a token attend to
successors of past occurrences of the same token in the input. This basic
mechanism supports LLMs' ability to copy and predict repeating patterns.
However, it is unclear if this same mechanism can support in-context learning
of more complex repetitive patterns with hierarchical structure. Natural
language is teeming with such cases: The article "the" in English usually
prefaces multiple nouns in a text. When predicting which token succeeds a
particular instance of "the", we need to integrate further contextual cues from
the text to predict the correct noun. If induction heads naively attend to all
past instances of successor tokens of "the" in a context-independent manner,
they cannot support this level of contextual information integration. In this
study, we design a synthetic in-context learning task, where tokens are
repeated with hierarchical dependencies. Here, attending uniformly to all
successor tokens is not sufficient to accurately predict future tokens.
Evaluating a range of LLMs on these token sequences and natural language
analogues, we find adaptive induction heads that support prediction by learning
what to attend to in-context. Next, we investigate how induction heads
themselves learn in-context. We find evidence that learning is supported by
attention heads that uncover a set of latent contexts, determining the
different token transition relationships. Overall, we not only show that LLMs
have induction heads that learn, but offer a complete mechanistic account of
how LLMs learn to predict higher-order repetitive patterns in-context.

Motivation: LLM自我意识和感知能力的可能性日益受到关注，具有重要的安全和政策影响，但目前测量这些能力的科学仍处于起步阶段。

Method: 采用受非人类动物元认知研究启发的行为实验范式，避免模型自我报告，测试模型在多大程度上能够策略性地运用内部状态知识，并分析模型返回的token概率。

Result: 前沿LLMs显示出某些元认知能力，包括评估对事实和推理问题回答的置信度，以及预测自身回答并适当利用该信息的能力。这些能力具有有限分辨率、情境依赖性，且与人类元认知存在质的不同。

Conclusion: LLMs确实表现出某些元认知能力，但这些能力与人类不同，且模型后训练可能在发展元认知能力中发挥作用。

Abstract: The possibility of LLM self-awareness and even sentience is gaining
increasing public attention and has major safety and policy implications, but
the science of measuring them is still in a nascent state. Here we introduce a
novel methodology for quantitatively evaluating metacognitive abilities in
LLMs. Taking inspiration from research on metacognition in nonhuman animals,
our approach eschews model self-reports and instead tests to what degree models
can strategically deploy knowledge of internal states. Using two experimental
paradigms, we demonstrate that frontier LLMs introduced since early 2024 show
increasingly strong evidence of certain metacognitive abilities, specifically
the ability to assess and utilize their own confidence in their ability to
answer factual and reasoning questions correctly and the ability to anticipate
what answers they would give and utilize that information appropriately. We
buttress these behavioral findings with an analysis of the token probabilities
returned by the models, which suggests the presence of an upstream internal
signal that could provide the basis for metacognition. We further find that
these abilities 1) are limited in resolution, 2) emerge in context-dependent
manners, and 3) seem to be qualitatively different from those of humans. We
also report intriguing differences across models of similar capabilities,
suggesting that LLM post-training may have a role in developing metacognitive
abilities.

Conclusion: 本书系统性地提供了处理选择不确定性的统计框架，为机器学习算法的理论分析奠定了坚实基础，覆盖了从离线到在线学习的各种场景。

Abstract: Learning, whether natural or artificial, is a process of selection. It starts
with a set of candidate options and selects the more successful ones. In the
case of machine learning the selection is done based on empirical estimates of
prediction accuracy of candidate prediction rules on some data. Due to
randomness of data sampling the empirical estimates are inherently noisy,
leading to selection under uncertainty. The book provides statistical tools to
obtain theoretical guarantees on the outcome of selection under uncertainty. We
start with concentration of measure inequalities, which are the main
statistical instrument for controlling how much an empirical estimate of
expectation of a function deviates from the true expectation. The book covers a
broad range of inequalities, including Markov's, Chebyshev's, Hoeffding's,
Bernstein's, Empirical Bernstein's, Unexpected Bernstein's, kl, and split-kl.
We then study the classical (offline) supervised learning and provide a range
of tools for deriving generalization bounds, including Occam's razor,
Vapnik-Chervonenkis analysis, and PAC-Bayesian analysis. The latter is further
applied to derive generalization guarantees for weighted majority votes. After
covering the offline setting, we turn our attention to online learning. We
present the space of online learning problems characterized by environmental
feedback, environmental resistance, and structural complexity. A common
performance measure in online learning is regret, which compares performance of
an algorithm to performance of the best prediction rule in hindsight, out of a
restricted set of prediction rules. We present tools for deriving regret bounds
in stochastic and adversarial environments, and under full information and
bandit feedback.

Conclusion: GDM通过连续松弛和Gumbel噪声模型，扩展了可用状态动力学集合，使模型能够更忠实地近似平滑和非平稳的真实动力学，并在真实世界应用中表现出色。

Abstract: Switching dynamical systems can model complicated time series data while
maintaining interpretability by inferring a finite set of dynamics primitives
and explaining different portions of the observed time series with one of these
primitives. However, due to the discrete nature of this set, such models
struggle to capture smooth, variable-speed transitions, as well as stochastic
mixtures of overlapping states, and the inferred dynamics often display
spurious rapid switching on real-world datasets. Here, we propose the Gumbel
Dynamical Model (GDM). First, by introducing a continuous relaxation of
discrete states and a different noise model defined on the relaxed-discrete
state space via the Gumbel distribution, GDM expands the set of available state
dynamics, allowing the model to approximate smoother and non-stationary
ground-truth dynamics more faithfully. Second, the relaxation makes the model
fully differentiable, enabling fast and scalable training with standard
gradient descent methods. We validate our approach on standard simulation
datasets and highlight its ability to model soft, sticky states and transitions
in a stochastic setting. Furthermore, we apply our model to two real-world
datasets, demonstrating its ability to infer interpretable states in stochastic
time series with multiple dynamics, a setting where traditional methods often
fail.

study illustrates the utility of various machine learning classifiers in
detecting spam reviews, with Logistic Regression achieving an accuracy of
90.35%, thus contributing to a more trustworthy and transparent online shopping

Abstract: Operator learning is a recently developed generalization of regression to
mappings between functions. It promises to drastically reduce expensive
numerical integration of PDEs to fast evaluations of mappings between
functional states of a system, i.e., surrogate and reduced-order modeling.
Operator learning has already found applications in several areas such as
modeling sea ice, combustion, and atmospheric physics. Recent approaches
towards integrating uncertainty quantification into the operator models have
relied on likelihood based methods to infer parameter distributions from noisy
data. However, stochastic operators may yield actions from which a likelihood
is difficult or impossible to construct. In this paper, we introduce, GenUQ, a
measure-theoretic approach to UQ that avoids constructing a likelihood by
introducing a generative hyper-network model that produces parameter
distributions consistent with observed data. We demonstrate that GenUQ
outperforms other UQ methods in three example problems, recovering a
manufactured operator, learning the solution operator to a stochastic elliptic
PDE, and modeling the failure location of porous steel under tension.

Conclusion: FedProTIP通过梯度投影和任务身份预测有效缓解了联邦持续学习中的灾难性遗忘问题，在任务序列中保持了良好的性能。

Abstract: Federated continual learning (FCL) enables distributed client devices to
learn from streaming data across diverse and evolving tasks. A major challenge
to continual learning, catastrophic forgetting, is exacerbated in decentralized
settings by the data heterogeneity, constrained communication and privacy
concerns. We propose Federated gradient Projection-based Continual Learning
with Task Identity Prediction (FedProTIP), a novel FCL framework that mitigates
forgetting by projecting client updates onto the orthogonal complement of the
subspace spanned by previously learned representations of the global model.
This projection reduces interference with earlier tasks and preserves
performance across the task sequence. To further address the challenge of
task-agnostic inference, we incorporate a lightweight mechanism that leverages
core bases from prior tasks to predict task identity and dynamically adjust the
global model's outputs. Extensive experiments across standard FCL benchmarks
demonstrate that FedProTIP significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods
in average accuracy, particularly in settings where task identities are a
priori unknown.

Abstract: The study of causal abstractions bridges two integral components of human
intelligence: the ability to determine cause and effect, and the ability to
interpret complex patterns into abstract concepts. Formally, causal abstraction
frameworks define connections between complicated low-level causal models and
simple high-level ones. One major limitation of most existing definitions is
that they are not well-defined when considering lossy abstraction functions in
which multiple low-level interventions can have different effects while mapping
to the same high-level intervention (an assumption called the abstract
invariance condition). In this paper, we introduce a new type of abstractions
called projected abstractions that generalize existing definitions to
accommodate lossy representations. We show how to construct a projected
abstraction from the low-level model and how it translates equivalent
observational, interventional, and counterfactual causal queries from low to
high-level. Given that the true model is rarely available in practice we prove
a new graphical criteria for identifying and estimating high-level causal
queries from limited low-level data. Finally, we experimentally show the
effectiveness of projected abstraction models in high-dimensional image
settings.

### [45] [LANCE: Low Rank Activation Compression for Efficient On-Device Continual Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21617)
*Marco Paul E. Apolinario,Kaushik Roy*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LANCE提出了一种低秩激活压缩框架，通过一次性高阶SVD获得可重用的低秩子空间进行激活投影，显著减少内存和计算开销，同时支持设备端持续学习。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 设备端学习需要高效学习，但现有激活压缩方法依赖重复低秩分解带来计算开销，且未探索持续学习场景。

Method: 使用一次性高阶SVD获得固定低秩子空间进行激活投影，避免重复分解，并通过正交子空间分配任务实现持续学习。

Result: 在多个数据集上减少激活存储达250倍，保持与完整反向传播相当的精度；在持续学习基准测试中性能与正交梯度投影方法相当但内存成本大幅降低。

Conclusion: LANCE为边缘设备上的高效微调和持续学习提供了实用且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: On-device learning is essential for personalization, privacy, and long-term
adaptation in resource-constrained environments. Achieving this requires
efficient learning, both fine-tuning existing models and continually acquiring
new tasks without catastrophic forgetting. Yet both settings are constrained by
high memory cost of storing activations during backpropagation. Existing
activation compression methods reduce this cost but relying on repeated
low-rank decompositions, introducing computational overhead. Also, such methods
have not been explored for continual learning. We propose LANCE (Low-rank
Activation Compression), a framework that performs one-shot higher-order
Singular Value Decompsoition (SVD) to obtain a reusable low-rank subspace for
activation projection. This eliminates repeated decompositions, reducing both
memory and computation. Moreover, fixed low-rank subspaces further enable
on-device continual learning by allocating tasks to orthogonal subspaces
without storing large task-specific matrices. Experiments show that LANCE
reduces activation storage up to 250$\times$ while maintaining accuracy
comparable to full backpropagation on CIFAR-10/100, Oxford-IIIT Pets,
Flowers102, and CUB-200 datasets. On continual learning benchmarks (Split
CIFAR-100, Split MiniImageNet, 5-Datasets), it achieves performance competitive
with orthogonal gradient projection methods at a fraction of the memory cost.
These results position LANCE as a practical and scalable solution for efficient
fine-tuning and continual learning on edge devices.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种直接从深度学习模型预测分子Hessian矩阵的方法，无需自动微分或有限差分，实现了比传统方法快1-2个数量级、更准确、内存效率更高的Hessian计算。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 分子Hessian矩阵在计算化学中至关重要，但传统计算方法计算成本高昂且随系统规模扩展性差，无论是量子力学方法还是神经网络都存在这一问题。

Method: 利用图神经网络消息传递过程中计算得到的不可约表示特征（最高到l=2度），构建SE(3)-等变的对称Hessian矩阵。

Result: HIP Hessians在过渡态搜索、加速几何优化、零点能校正和振动分析基准测试中均表现出持续优越的性能。

Conclusion: HIP方法为直接预测Hessian矩阵提供了有效的解决方案，具有更快的速度、更高的精度和更好的扩展性。

Abstract: Fundamental tasks in computational chemistry, from transition state search to
vibrational analysis, rely on molecular Hessians, which are the second
derivatives of the potential energy. Yet, Hessians are computationally
expensive to calculate and scale poorly with system size, with both quantum
mechanical methods and neural networks. In this work, we demonstrate that
Hessians can be predicted directly from a deep learning model, without relying
on automatic differentiation or finite differences. We observe that one can
construct SE(3)-equivariant, symmetric Hessians from irreducible
representations (irrep) features up to degree $l$=2 computed during message
passing in graph neural networks. This makes HIP Hessians one to two orders of
magnitude faster, more accurate, more memory efficient, easier to train, and
enables more favorable scaling with system size. We validate our predictions
across a wide range of downstream tasks, demonstrating consistently superior
performance for transition state search, accelerated geometry optimization,
zero-point energy corrections, and vibrational analysis benchmarks. We
open-source the HIP codebase and model weights to enable further development of
the direct prediction of Hessians at https://github.com/BurgerAndreas/hip

*Feng Yu,Jia Hu,Geyong Min*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了BHRA方法，通过分块Hadamard调制解决LoRA类方法在参数高效微调中的全局调制限制问题，在保持参数效率的同时实现局部秩增强。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统LoRA方法受限于名义秩r，而HiRA等扩展方法虽然提高了名义秩但将每个更新与冻结权重矩阵的全局能量模式耦合，ABBA方法则完全学习密集中间层。为了解决全局调制的限制，需要一种既能保持参数效率又能实现局部秩增强的方法。

Method: 提出Block Hadamard high-Rank Adaptation (BHRA)，将每个权重矩阵分区，在每个块内独立应用HiRA风格的乘法调制，保持PEFT参数足迹的同时解锁局部秩放大。

Result: 在8个常识推理任务和2个算术基准测试中，使用Llama-3.2 1B/3B、Mistral-7B和Gemma-2 9B模型，BHRA在匹配参数预算下始终优于强PEFT基线。

Conclusion: 块状设计在保持丰富频谱的同时缓解了全局调制引起的崩溃，BHRA方法在参数高效微调中表现出色。

Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods must be resource-efficient yet
handle heterogeneous reasoning transformations, and classical low-rank
adaptation (LoRA) is constrained by the nominal rank $r$. Hadamard-style
extensions like HiRA raise the nominal rank but couple every update to the
global energy pattern of the frozen weight matrix, while ABBA trades this
inductive bias for fully learned dense intermediates. To address the limitation
of global modulation, we propose Block Hadamard high-Rank Adaptation (BHRA),
which partitions each weight matrix and applies HiRA-style multiplicative
modulation independently within every block, preserving the PEFT parameter
footprint while unlocking localized rank amplification. Our empirical analyses
reveal that this blockwise design maintains rich spectra across rank budgets,
mitigating the collapse induced by global modulation. Across eight commonsense
reasoning tasks and two arithmetic benchmarks with Llama-3.2 1B/3B, Mistral-7B,
and Gemma-2 9B, BHRA consistently surpasses strong PEFT baselines under matched
parameter budgets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管掩码预训练在语言、视觉和生物学领域取得了经验性成功，但其在数据表示学习中的作用和限制仍不清楚。研究旨在从理论角度理解掩码预训练的行为机制。

Method: 使用高维最小范数线性回归理论框架直接表征掩码预训练行为，不依赖额外模型规范。基于理论分析提出R²MAE方法，通过随机变化掩码比例强制模型捕获多尺度特征。

Result: 理论框架在多种神经网络架构上得到验证。R²MAE在视觉、语言、DNA序列和单细胞模型中均优于标准和复杂掩码方案，能提升最先进模型的性能。

Conclusion: 掩码预训练行为可通过线性回归理论框架直接表征，提出的R²MAE方法简单有效，在多个领域都能带来性能提升，为理解掩码预训练机制提供了理论基础。

Abstract: Mask-based pretraining has become a cornerstone of modern large-scale models
across language, vision, and recently biology. Despite its empirical success,
its role and limits in learning data representations have been unclear. In this
work, we show that the behavior of mask-based pretraining can be directly
characterized by test risk in high-dimensional minimum-norm ("ridge-less")
linear regression, without relying on further model specifications. Further
analysis of linear models uncovers several novel aspects of mask-based
pretraining. The theoretical framework and its implications have been validated
across diverse neural architectures (including MLPs, CNNs, and Transformers)
applied to both vision and language tasks. Guided by our theory, we propose an
embarrassingly simple yet overlooked pretraining scheme named Randomly Random
Mask AutoEncoding (R$^2$MAE), which enforces capturing multi-scale features
from data and is able to outperform optimal fixed mask ratio settings in our
linear model framework. We implement R$^2$MAE in vision, language, DNA
sequence, and single-cell models, where it consistently outperforms standard
and more complicated masking schemes, leading to improvements for
state-of-the-art models. Our code is available at:

TL;DR: 该论文通过严格的数学定义证明了安全、信任和通用人工智能之间的基本不兼容性：一个安全且可信的AI系统不可能是通用人工智能系统。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为人工智能系统中的安全性、信任和通用人工智能等概念提供严格的数学定义，并探索它们之间的基本关系。

Method: 采用形式化数学定义：安全性定义为系统从不做出虚假声明，信任定义为假设系统是安全的，AGI定义为AI系统始终匹配或超越人类能力。通过程序验证、规划和图可达性等领域的证明来展示不兼容性。

Result: 核心发现：对于这些形式化定义，安全且可信的AI系统不能是AGI系统——存在某些任务实例，人类可以轻松且可证明地解决，但系统无法解决。

Conclusion: 安全性、信任和通用人工智能在严格数学定义下存在根本性不兼容，这一结果与哥德尔不完备性定理和图灵停机问题不可判定性的证明有相似之处。

Abstract: Safety, trust and Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) are aspirational
goals in artificial intelligence (AI) systems, and there are several informal
interpretations of these notions. In this paper, we propose strict,
mathematical definitions of safety, trust, and AGI, and demonstrate a
fundamental incompatibility between them. We define safety of a system as the
property that it never makes any false claims, trust as the assumption that the
system is safe, and AGI as the property of an AI system always matching or
exceeding human capability. Our core finding is that -- for our formal
definitions of these notions -- a safe and trusted AI system cannot be an AGI
system: for such a safe, trusted system there are task instances which are
easily and provably solvable by a human but not by the system. We note that we
consider strict mathematical definitions of safety and trust, and it is
possible for real-world deployments to instead rely on alternate, practical
interpretations of these notions. We show our results for program verification,
planning, and graph reachability. Our proofs draw parallels to G\"odel's
incompleteness theorems and Turing's proof of the undecidability of the halting
problem, and can be regarded as interpretations of G\"odel's and Turing's
results.

TL;DR: DriftLite是一种轻量级、无需训练的粒子方法，通过最优稳定性控制来引导扩散模型的推理动态，在推理时适应新分布而无需重新训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于引导的方法简单但引入偏差，而基于粒子的校正方法存在权重退化和高计算成本的问题。

Method: 利用Fokker-Planck方程中漂移和粒子势之间未被探索的自由度，开发了方差控制引导(VCG)和能量控制引导(ECG)两种实例化方法。

Result: 在高斯混合模型、粒子系统和蛋白质-配体共折叠问题中，DriftLite相比纯引导和顺序蒙特卡罗基线方法，持续减少方差并提高样本质量。

Conclusion: DriftLite为扩散模型的可扩展推理时适应提供了一条原则性、高效的路径。

Abstract: We study inference-time scaling for diffusion models, where the goal is to
adapt a pre-trained model to new target distributions without retraining.
Existing guidance-based methods are simple but introduce bias, while
particle-based corrections suffer from weight degeneracy and high computational
cost. We introduce DriftLite, a lightweight, training-free particle-based
approach that steers the inference dynamics on the fly with provably optimal
stability control. DriftLite exploits a previously unexplored degree of freedom
in the Fokker-Planck equation between the drift and particle potential, and
yields two practical instantiations: Variance- and Energy-Controlling Guidance
(VCG/ECG) for approximating the optimal drift with minimal overhead. Across
Gaussian mixture models, particle systems, and large-scale protein-ligand
co-folding problems, DriftLite consistently reduces variance and improves
sample quality over pure guidance and sequential Monte Carlo baselines. These
results highlight a principled, efficient route toward scalable inference-time
adaptation of diffusion models.

TL;DR: 提出了一种可微分结构学习框架，能够捕捉离散变量间的任意依赖关系，避免了现有方法对特定结构方程模型和数据线性效应的限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有离散数据可微分结构学习方法通常假设数据来自特定结构方程模型，且仅考虑线性效应，这与真实数据生成过程不符，限制了方法的通用性。

Method: 将学习问题表述为最一般形式的单次可微分优化任务，避免先前方法采用的不切实际的简化假设，能够表征兼容参数和结构的完整集合。

Result: 实证结果表明，该方法能有效捕捉离散数据中的复杂关系。

Conclusion: 尽管一般离散模型从纯观测数据中不可识别，但在温和假设下可建立马尔可夫等价类的可识别性，提出的框架避免了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: Existing methods for differentiable structure learning in discrete data
typically assume that the data are generated from specific structural equation
models. However, these assumptions may not align with the true data-generating
process, which limits the general applicability of such methods. Furthermore,
current approaches often ignore the complex dependence structure inherent in
discrete data and consider only linear effects. We propose a differentiable
structure learning framework that is capable of capturing arbitrary
dependencies among discrete variables. We show that although general discrete
models are unidentifiable from purely observational data, it is possible to
characterize the complete set of compatible parameters and structures.
Additionally, we establish identifiability up to Markov equivalence under mild
assumptions. We formulate the learning problem as a single differentiable
optimization task in the most general form, thereby avoiding the unrealistic
simplifications adopted by previous methods. Empirical results demonstrate that
our approach effectively captures complex relationships in discrete data.

Abstract: Partial differential equation (PDE)-governed inverse problems are fundamental
across various scientific and engineering applications; yet they face
significant challenges due to nonlinearity, ill-posedness, and sensitivity to
noise. Here, we introduce a new computational framework, RED-DiffEq, by
integrating physics-driven inversion and data-driven learning. RED-DiffEq
leverages pretrained diffusion models as a regularization mechanism for
PDE-governed inverse problems. We apply RED-DiffEq to solve the full waveform
inversion problem in geophysics, a challenging seismic imaging technique that
seeks to reconstruct high-resolution subsurface velocity models from seismic
measurement data. Our method shows enhanced accuracy and robustness compared to
conventional methods. Additionally, it exhibits strong generalization ability
to more complex velocity models that the diffusion model is not trained on. Our
framework can also be directly applied to diverse PDE-governed inverse
problems.

Abstract: Treatment effect estimation is essential for informed decision-making in many
fields such as healthcare, economics, and public policy. While flexible machine
learning models have been widely applied for estimating heterogeneous treatment
effects, quantifying the inherent uncertainty of their point predictions
remains an issue. Recent advancements in conformal prediction address this
limitation by allowing for inexpensive computation, as well as distribution
shifts, while still providing frequentist, finite-sample coverage guarantees
under minimal assumptions for any point-predictor model. This advancement holds
significant potential for improving decision-making in especially high-stakes
environments. In this work, we perform a systematic review regarding conformal
prediction methods for treatment effect estimation and provide for both the
necessary theoretical background. Through a systematic filtering process, we
select and analyze eleven key papers, identifying and describing current
state-of-the-art methods in this area. Based on our findings, we propose
directions for future research.

Conclusion: MMPlanner通过显式建模对象状态转换和系统评估协议，在多模态程序规划任务中取得了显著改进

Abstract: Multimodal Procedural Planning (MPP) aims to generate step-by-step
instructions that combine text and images, with the central challenge of
preserving object-state consistency across modalities while producing
informative plans. Existing approaches often leverage large language models
(LLMs) to refine textual steps; however, visual object-state alignment and
systematic evaluation are largely underexplored. We present MMPlanner, a
zero-shot MPP framework that introduces Object State Reasoning Chain-of-Thought
(OSR-CoT) prompting to explicitly model object-state transitions and generate
accurate multimodal plans. To assess plan quality, we design LLM-as-a-judge
protocols for planning accuracy and cross-modal alignment, and further propose
a visual step-reordering task to measure temporal coherence. Experiments on
RECIPEPLAN and WIKIPLAN show that MMPlanner achieves state-of-the-art
performance, improving textual planning by +6.8%, cross-modal alignment by
+11.9%, and visual step ordering by +26.7%

Motivation: 神经符号集成领域存在两种方法：手工规则注入和数据驱动的规则学习，需要一种统一框架来灵活整合数据驱动的规则学习和符号先验知识。

Method: 扩展命题逻辑语法，引入具有可学习参数的选择操作符，使用模糊逻辑将公式编译为可微分计算图，通过反向传播学习最优选择。

Conclusion: LoH框架统一了神经符号集成的不同方法，支持任意程度的知识规范，同时保持模型的可解释性和性能。

Abstract: Neurosymbolic integration (NeSy) blends neural-network learning with symbolic
reasoning. The field can be split between methods injecting hand-crafted rules
into neural models, and methods inducing symbolic rules from data. We introduce
Logic of Hypotheses (LoH), a novel language that unifies these strands,
enabling the flexible integration of data-driven rule learning with symbolic
priors and expert knowledge. LoH extends propositional logic syntax with a
choice operator, which has learnable parameters and selects a subformula from a
pool of options. Using fuzzy logic, formulas in LoH can be directly compiled
into a differentiable computational graph, so the optimal choices can be
learned via backpropagation. This framework subsumes some existing NeSy models,
while adding the possibility of arbitrary degrees of knowledge specification.
Moreover, the use of Goedel fuzzy logic and the recently developed Goedel trick
yields models that can be discretized to hard Boolean-valued functions without
any loss in performance. We provide experimental analysis on such models,
showing strong results on tabular data and on the Visual Tic-Tac-Toe NeSy task,
while producing interpretable decision rules.

Conclusion: DIM通过应用领域知识驱动的单调性约束来正则化模型行为，减轻过拟合，从而增强深度神经网络的预测性能

Abstract: While deep learning models excel at predictive tasks, they often overfit due
to their complex structure and large number of parameters, causing them to
memorize training data, including noise, rather than learn patterns that
generalize to new data. To tackle this challenge, this paper proposes a new
regularization method, i.e., Enforcing Domain-Informed Monotonicity in Deep
Neural Networks (DIM), which maintains domain-informed monotonic relationships
in complex deep learning models to further improve predictions. Specifically,
our method enforces monotonicity by penalizing violations relative to a linear
baseline, effectively encouraging the model to follow expected trends while
preserving its predictive power. We formalize this approach through a
comprehensive mathematical framework that establishes a linear reference,
measures deviations from monotonic behavior, and integrates these measurements
into the training objective. We test and validate the proposed methodology
using a real-world ridesourcing dataset from Chicago and a synthetically
created dataset. Experiments across various neural network architectures show
that even modest monotonicity constraints consistently enhance model
performance. DIM enhances the predictive performance of deep neural networks by
applying domain-informed monotonicity constraints to regularize model behavior
and mitigate overfitting

Abstract: High-resolution neural datasets enable foundation models for the next
generation of brain-computer interfaces and neurological treatments. The
community requires rigorous benchmarks to discriminate between competing
modeling approaches, yet no standardized evaluation frameworks exist for
intracranial EEG (iEEG) recordings. To address this gap, we present Neuroprobe:
a suite of decoding tasks for studying multi-modal language processing in the
brain. Unlike scalp EEG, intracranial EEG requires invasive surgery to implant
electrodes that record neural activity directly from the brain with minimal
signal distortion. Neuroprobe is built on the BrainTreebank dataset, which
consists of 40 hours of iEEG recordings from 10 human subjects performing a
naturalistic movie viewing task. Neuroprobe serves two critical functions.
First, it is a mine from which neuroscience insights can be drawn. Its high
temporal and spatial resolution allows researchers to systematically determine
when and where computations for each aspect of language processing occur in the
brain by measuring the decodability of each feature across time and all
electrode locations. Using Neuroprobe, we visualize how information flows from
the superior temporal gyrus to the prefrontal cortex, and the progression from
simple auditory features to more complex language features in a purely
data-driven manner. Second, as the field moves toward neural foundation models,
Neuroprobe provides a rigorous framework for comparing competing architectures
and training protocols. We found that the linear baseline is surprisingly
strong, beating frontier foundation models on many tasks. Neuroprobe is
designed with computational efficiency and ease of use in mind. We make the
code for Neuroprobe openly available and maintain a public leaderboard, aiming
to enable rapid progress in the field of iEEG foundation models, at

Conclusion: SlotFM展示了感知基础模型的强泛化能力，为超越标准人类活动识别的多样化应用提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Wearable accelerometers are used for a wide range of applications, such as
gesture recognition, gait analysis, and sports monitoring. Yet most existing
foundation models focus primarily on classifying common daily activities such
as locomotion and exercise, limiting their applicability to the broader range
of tasks that rely on other signal characteristics. We present SlotFM, an
accelerometer foundation model that generalizes across diverse downstream
tasks. SlotFM uses Time-Frequency Slot Attention, an extension of Slot
Attention that processes both time and frequency representations of the raw
signals. It generates multiple small embeddings (slots), each capturing
different signal components, enabling task-specific heads to focus on the most
relevant parts of the data. We also introduce two loss regularizers that
capture local structure and frequency patterns, which improve reconstruction of
fine-grained details and helps the embeddings preserve task-relevant
information. We evaluate SlotFM on 16 classification and regression downstream
tasks that extend beyond standard human activity recognition. It outperforms
existing self-supervised approaches on 13 of these tasks and achieves
comparable results to the best performing approaches on the remaining tasks. On
average, our method yields a 4.5% performance gain, demonstrating strong
generalization for sensing foundation models.

Conclusion: 该方法为K-means聚类提供了一种高效的第二阶优化方法，在收敛速度和统计精度方面都表现出色。

Abstract: Clustering is a hard discrete optimization problem. Nonconvex approaches such
as low-rank semidefinite programming (SDP) have recently demonstrated promising
statistical and local algorithmic guarantees for cluster recovery. Due to the
combinatorial structure of the $K$-means clustering problem, current relaxation
algorithms struggle to balance their constraint feasibility and objective
optimality, presenting tremendous challenges in computing the second-order
critical points with rigorous guarantees. In this paper, we provide a new
formulation of the $K$-means problem as a smooth unconstrained optimization
over a submanifold and characterize its Riemannian structures to allow it to be
solved using a second-order cubic-regularized Riemannian Newton algorithm. By
factorizing the $K$-means manifold into a product manifold, we show how each
Newton subproblem can be solved in linear time. Our numerical experiments show
that the proposed method converges significantly faster than the
state-of-the-art first-order nonnegative low-rank factorization method, while
achieving similarly optimal statistical accuracy.

Motivation: 前馈神经网络的逻辑很大程度上体现在内部层神经元的激活状态中，通过分析这些状态可以提取出网络的形式化属性，用于解释、验证和修复神经网络。

Method: 基于神经元激活状态（数值或开关状态）提取规则，这些规则作为前提条件可以推导出期望的输出属性（如特定类别预测）。

Conclusion: Prophecy在大型视觉语言模型时代具有重要潜力，能够自动推断神经网络的形式化属性，为网络解释、验证和修复提供有效工具。

Abstract: We present Prophecy, a tool for automatically inferring formal properties of
feed-forward neural networks. Prophecy is based on the observation that a
significant part of the logic of feed-forward networks is captured in the
activation status of the neurons at inner layers. Prophecy works by extracting
rules based on neuron activations (values or on/off statuses) as preconditions
that imply certain desirable output property, e.g., the prediction being a
certain class. These rules represent network properties captured in the hidden
layers that imply the desired output behavior. We present the architecture of
the tool, highlight its features and demonstrate its usage on different types
of models and output properties. We present an overview of its applications,
such as inferring and proving formal explanations of neural networks,
compositional verification, run-time monitoring, repair, and others. We also
show novel results highlighting its potential in the era of large
vision-language models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自回归模型在蛋白质工程中面临生成延迟问题，且传统推测解码中的草稿模型忽略蛋白质结构和功能约束，导致生物不可信的序列输出

Method: 使用从多序列比对中提取的k-mer基序，结合生物、结构和功能先验知识，并行评分候选序列并选择最符合已知生物模式的序列

Result: SpecMER相比标准自回归解码实现了24-32%的加速，同时具有更高的接受率和改进的序列似然性

Conclusion: SpecMER成功将生物先验知识整合到推测解码中，在保持生成效率的同时显著提高了蛋白质序列的生物学合理性

Abstract: Autoregressive models have transformed protein engineering by enabling the
generation of novel protein sequences beyond those found in nature. However,
their sequential inference introduces significant latency, limiting their
utility in high-throughput protein screening. Speculative decoding accelerates
generation by employing a lightweight draft model to sample tokens, which a
larger target model then verifies and refines. Yet, in protein sequence
generation, draft models are typically agnostic to the structural and
functional constraints of the target protein, leading to biologically
implausible outputs and a shift in the likelihood distribution of generated
sequences. We introduce SpecMER (Speculative Decoding via k-mer Guidance), a
novel framework that incorporates biological, structural, and functional priors
using k-mer motifs extracted from multiple sequence alignments. By scoring
candidate sequences in parallel and selecting those most consistent with known
biological patterns, SpecMER significantly improves sequence plausibility while
retaining the efficiency of speculative decoding. SpecMER achieves 24-32%
speedup over standard autoregressive decoding, along with higher acceptance
rates and improved sequence likelihoods.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文提出了三种正交改进方法来提升仅使用PPG信号的心脏骤停预测系统：时间到事件建模、患者身份不变性特征学习和辅助网络伪标签回归，将24小时时间平均AUC从0.74提升到0.78-0.80范围。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于PPG的生理基础模型虽然能预测心脏骤停等关键事件，但其强大表征能力在数据/标签稀缺的下游任务中未能充分利用，需要更有效的利用方法。

Method: 1. 时间到事件建模：通过回归事件发生时间或精细离散生存建模；2. 患者身份不变性：训练大规模去识别生物特征识别模型(p-vector)，对抗性学习去除可能导致过拟合的身份线索；3. 辅助网络伪标签回归：利用预训练辅助网络生成伪连续估计值作为目标，丰富心脏骤停波形标签。

Result: 提出的方法独立地将24小时时间平均AUC从0.74提升到0.78-0.80范围，主要改善了较长时程的预测性能，在事件附近仅有最小退化。

Conclusion: 通过多任务公式和PCGrad优化技术缓解竞争损失间的高梯度冲突，推动了早期预警系统的研究进展。

Abstract: High-frequency physiological waveform modality offers deep, real-time
insights into patient status. Recently, physiological foundation models based
on Photoplethysmography (PPG), such as PPG-GPT, have been shown to predict
critical events, including Cardiac Arrest (CA). However, their powerful
representation still needs to be leveraged suitably, especially when the
downstream data/label is scarce. We offer three orthogonal improvements to
improve PPG-only CA systems by using minimal auxiliary information. First, we
propose to use time-to-event modeling, either through simple regression to the
event onset time or by pursuing fine-grained discrete survival modeling.
Second, we encourage the model to learn CA-focused features by making them
patient-identity invariant. This is achieved by first training the
largest-scale de-identified biometric identification model, referred to as the
p-vector, and subsequently using it adversarially to deconfound cues, such as
person identity, that may cause overfitting through memorization. Third, we
propose regression on the pseudo-lab values generated by pre-trained auxiliary
estimator networks. This is crucial since true blood lab measurements, such as
lactate, sodium, troponin, and potassium, are collected sparingly. Via
zero-shot prediction, the auxiliary networks can enrich cardiac arrest waveform
labels and generate pseudo-continuous estimates as targets. Our proposals can
independently improve the 24-hour time-averaged AUC from the 0.74 to the
0.78-0.80 range. We primarily improve over longer time horizons with minimal
degradation near the event, thus pushing the Early Warning System research.
Finally, we pursue multi-task formulation and diagnose it with a high gradient
conflict rate among competing losses, which we alleviate via the PCGrad
optimization technique.

Method: 结合精确子图枚举和神经网络，使用稀疏正则化实现有效的剪枝策略和重要子图识别。

Result: EIN相比标准图神经网络模型具有足够高的预测性能，并能通过选择的子图进行后验分析。

Conclusion: EIN通过子图枚举和稀疏正则化的结合，在保持预测性能的同时提高了模型的可解释性。

Abstract: In the graph-level prediction task (predict a label for a given graph), the
information contained in subgraphs of the input graph plays a key role. In this
paper, we propose Exact subgraph Isomorphism Network (EIN), which combines the
exact subgraph enumeration, neural network, and a sparse regularization. In
general, building a graph-level prediction model achieving high discriminative
ability along with interpretability is still a challenging problem. Our
combination of the subgraph enumeration and neural network contributes to high
discriminative ability about the subgraph structure of the input graph.
Further, the sparse regularization in EIN enables us 1) to derive an effective
pruning strategy that mitigates computational difficulty of the enumeration
while maintaining the prediction performance, and 2) to identify important
subgraphs that contributes to high interpretability. We empirically show that
EIN has sufficiently high prediction performance compared with standard graph
neural network models, and also, we show examples of post-hoc analysis based on
the selected subgraphs.

Abstract: Understanding urban human mobility patterns at various spatial levels is
essential for social science. This study presents a machine learning framework
to downscale origin-destination (OD) taxi trips flows in New York City from a
larger spatial unit to a smaller spatial unit. First, correlations between OD
trips and demographic, socioeconomic, and commuting characteristics are
developed using four models: Linear Regression (LR), Random Forest (RF),
Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Neural Networks (NN). Second, a
perturbation-based sensitivity analysis is applied to interpret variable
importance for nonlinear models. The results show that the linear regression
model failed to capture the complex variable interactions. While NN performs
best with the training and testing datasets, SVM shows the best generalization
ability in downscaling performance. The methodology presented in this study
provides both analytical advancement and practical applications to improve
transportation services and urban development.

Motivation: 联邦学习中数据异构性持续挑战全局模型性能，传统方法依赖所有客户端的协作训练后进行本地适配，需要更早的质量控制机制。

Method: 从客户端原始数据提取代表性特征，应用聚类技术估计客户端间数据集相似度，基于相似度估计实施客户端选择策略，让客户端与数据分布兼容的其他客户端协作。

Result: 在CIFAR-10和MNIST数据集上评估，与三种现有联邦学习算法集成，PQFed持续提升目标客户端模型性能，即使在参与者数量有限的情况下；相比基线聚类算法IFCA，在低参与场景下表现更好。

Conclusion: PQFed在个性化联邦学习设置中具有可扩展性和有效性，通过早期相似度估计和选择性协作改善了数据异构环境下的学习效果。

Abstract: Federated learning enables collaborative model training without sharing raw
data, but data heterogeneity consistently challenges the performance of the
global model. Traditional optimization methods often rely on collaborative
global model training involving all clients, followed by local adaptation to
improve individual performance. In this work, we focus on early-stage quality
control and propose PQFed, a novel privacy-preserving personalized federated
learning framework that designs customized training strategies for each client
prior to the federated training process. PQFed extracts representative features
from each client's raw data and applies clustering techniques to estimate
inter-client dataset similarity. Based on these similarity estimates, the
framework implements a client selection strategy that enables each client to
collaborate with others who have compatible data distributions. We evaluate
PQFed on two benchmark datasets, CIFAR-10 and MNIST, integrated with three
existing federated learning algorithms. Experimental results show that PQFed
consistently improves the target client's model performance, even with a
limited number of participants. We further benchmark PQFed against a baseline
cluster-based algorithm, IFCA, and observe that PQFed also achieves better
performance in low-participation scenarios. These findings highlight PQFed's
scalability and effectiveness in personalized federated learning settings.

Abstract: Harnessing parallelism in seemingly sequential models is a central challenge
for modern machine learning. Several approaches have been proposed for
evaluating sequential processes in parallel using fixed-point methods, like
Newton, Picard, and Jacobi iterations. In this work, we show that these methods
can be understood within a common framework based on linear dynamical systems
(LDSs), where different iteration schemes arise naturally as approximate
linearizations of a nonlinear recursion. This unifying view highlights shared
principles behind these techniques and clarifies when particular fixed-point
methods are most likely to be effective. By bridging diverse algorithms through
the language of LDSs, our framework provides a clearer theoretical foundation
for parallelizing sequential models and points toward new opportunities for
efficient and scalable computation.

Motivation: 双层优化问题具有复杂的嵌套结构，相比其他贝叶斯优化的扩展（如多目标或约束设置）研究较少。当上下层都涉及昂贵的黑盒函数时，需要有效的优化方法。

Conclusion: 提出的信息论方法能够有效处理双层优化问题，特别是在上下层都涉及昂贵黑盒函数的情况下，通过统一的信息增益标准实现了同时优化两个层级的目标。

Abstract: A bilevel optimization problem consists of two optimization problems nested
as an upper- and a lower-level problem, in which the optimality of the
lower-level problem defines a constraint for the upper-level problem. This
paper considers Bayesian optimization (BO) for the case that both the upper-
and lower-levels involve expensive black-box functions. Because of its nested
structure, bilevel optimization has a complex problem definition and, compared
with other standard extensions of BO such as multi-objective or constraint
settings, it has not been widely studied. We propose an information-theoretic
approach that considers the information gain of both the upper- and
lower-optimal solutions and values. This enables us to define a unified
criterion that measures the benefit for both level problems, simultaneously.
Further, we also show a practical lower bound based approach to evaluating the
information gain. We empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed
method through several benchmark datasets.

Method: 开发可解释的时空图神经网络框架，利用双重随机微分方程(SDEs)建模不规则采样的纵向功能磁共振成像(fMRI)数据，学习稀疏的区域和连接重要性概率。

Result: 在两个独立队列(OASIS-3和ADNI)上验证有效，识别出海马旁皮层、前额叶皮层和顶叶小叶等关键区域，发现腹侧注意、背侧注意和默认模式网络的显著破坏，这些异常与纵向AD相关临床症状密切相关。

Conclusion: 该框架揭示了已建立和新的神经系统水平和性别特异性生物标志物，为理解AD进展的神经生物学机制提供了新见解，突显了基于时空图的学习在早期个体化预测AD进展方面的潜力。

Abstract: Identifying objective neuroimaging biomarkers to forecast Alzheimer's disease
(AD) progression is crucial for timely intervention. However, this task remains
challenging due to the complex dysfunctions in the spatio-temporal
characteristics of underlying brain networks, which are often overlooked by
existing methods. To address these limitations, we develop an interpretable
spatio-temporal graph neural network framework to predict future AD
progression, leveraging dual Stochastic Differential Equations (SDEs) to model
the irregularly-sampled longitudinal functional magnetic resonance imaging
(fMRI) data. We validate our approach on two independent cohorts, including the
Open Access Series of Imaging Studies (OASIS-3) and the Alzheimer's Disease
Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). Our framework effectively learns sparse
regional and connective importance probabilities, enabling the identification
of key brain circuit abnormalities associated with disease progression.
Notably, we detect the parahippocampal cortex, prefrontal cortex, and parietal
lobule as salient regions, with significant disruptions in the ventral
attention, dorsal attention, and default mode networks. These abnormalities
correlate strongly with longitudinal AD-related clinical symptoms. Moreover,
our interpretability strategy reveals both established and novel neural
systems-level and sex-specific biomarkers, offering new insights into the
neurobiological mechanisms underlying AD progression. Our findings highlight
the potential of spatio-temporal graph-based learning for early, individualized
prediction of AD progression, even in the context of irregularly-sampled
longitudinal imaging data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统药物先导化合物优化方法在样本效率方面存在不足，需要大量评估才能获得良好性能。大语言模型虽然具有上下文学习和指令跟随能力，但现有方法未能充分利用这些优势，将每个优化步骤独立处理。

Method: 提出POLO框架，核心是偏好引导策略优化(PGPO)算法，从两个互补层面提取学习信号：轨迹级优化强化成功策略，轮级偏好学习通过排名中间分子提供密集比较反馈。

Result: POLO在单属性任务上达到84%的平均成功率（比基线方法高2.3倍），在多属性任务上达到50%成功率，仅使用500次评估，显著推进了样本高效分子优化的技术水平。

Conclusion: POLO通过从完整优化轨迹中学习，充分利用昂贵的评估调用，在药物先导化合物优化中实现了卓越的样本效率，为分子优化领域提供了新的先进方法。

Abstract: Lead optimization in drug discovery requires efficiently navigating vast
chemical space through iterative cycles to enhance molecular properties while
preserving structural similarity to the original lead compound. Despite recent
advances, traditional optimization methods struggle with sample
efficiency-achieving good optimization performance with limited oracle
evaluations. Large Language Models (LLMs) provide a promising approach through
their in-context learning and instruction following capabilities, which align
naturally with these iterative processes. However, existing LLM-based methods
fail to leverage this strength, treating each optimization step independently.
To address this, we present POLO (Preference-guided multi-turn Optimization for
Lead Optimization), which enables LLMs to learn from complete optimization
trajectories rather than isolated steps. At its core, POLO introduces
Preference-Guided Policy Optimization (PGPO), a novel reinforcement learning
algorithm that extracts learning signals at two complementary levels:
trajectory-level optimization reinforces successful strategies, while
turn-level preference learning provides dense comparative feedback by ranking
intermediate molecules within each trajectory. Through this dual-level learning
from intermediate evaluation, POLO achieves superior sample efficiency by fully
exploiting each costly oracle call. Extensive experiments demonstrate that POLO
achieves 84% average success rate on single-property tasks (2.3x better than
baselines) and 50% on multi-property tasks using only 500 oracle evaluations,
significantly advancing the state-of-the-art in sample-efficient molecular
optimization.

Conclusion: BrainPoG能够专门学习信息丰富的疾病相关知识，避免学习不相关信息，实现了高效的脑图学习，具有实际临床应用价值。

Abstract: Brain graph learning has demonstrated significant achievements in the fields
of neuroscience and artificial intelligence. However, existing methods struggle
to selectively learn disease-related knowledge, leading to heavy parameters and
computational costs. This challenge diminishes their efficiency, as well as
limits their practicality for real-world clinical applications. To this end, we
propose a lightweight Brain PathoGraph Learning (BrainPoG) model that enables
efficient brain graph learning by pathological pattern filtering and
pathological feature distillation. Specifically, BrainPoG first contains a
filter to extract the pathological pattern formulated by highly
disease-relevant subgraphs, achieving graph pruning and lesion localization. A
PathoGraph is therefore constructed by dropping less disease-relevant subgraphs
from the whole brain graph. Afterwards, a pathological feature distillation
module is designed to reduce disease-irrelevant noise features and enhance
pathological features of each node in the PathoGraph. BrainPoG can exclusively
learn informative disease-related knowledge while avoiding less relevant
information, achieving efficient brain graph learning. Extensive experiments on
four benchmark datasets demonstrate that BrainPoG exhibits superiority in both
model performance and computational efficiency across various brain disease
detection tasks.

Abstract: The goal of coreset selection methods is to identify representative subsets
of datasets for efficient model training. Yet, existing methods often ignore
the possibility of annotation errors and require fixed pruning ratios, making
them impractical in real-world settings. We present HyperCore, a robust and
adaptive coreset selection framework designed explicitly for noisy
environments. HyperCore leverages lightweight hypersphere models learned per
class, embedding in-class samples close to a hypersphere center while naturally
segregating out-of-class samples based on their distance. By using Youden's J
statistic, HyperCore can adaptively select pruning thresholds, enabling
automatic, noise-aware data pruning without hyperparameter tuning. Our
experiments reveal that HyperCore consistently surpasses state-of-the-art
coreset selection methods, especially under noisy and low-data regimes.
HyperCore effectively discards mislabeled and ambiguous points, yielding

Abstract: The goal of coreset selection is to identify representative subsets of
datasets for efficient model training. Yet, existing approaches paradoxically
require expensive training-based signals, e.g., gradients, decision boundary
estimates or forgetting counts, computed over the entire dataset prior to
pruning, which undermines their very purpose by requiring training on samples
they aim to avoid. We introduce SubZeroCore, a novel, training-free coreset
selection method that integrates submodular coverage and density into a single,
unified objective. To achieve this, we introduce a sampling strategy based on a
closed-form solution to optimally balance these objectives, guided by a single
hyperparameter that explicitly controls the desired coverage for local density
measures. Despite no training, extensive evaluations show that SubZeroCore
matches training-based baselines and significantly outperforms them at high
pruning rates, while dramatically reducing computational overhead. SubZeroCore
also demonstrates superior robustness to label noise, highlighting its
practical effectiveness and scalability for real-world scenarios.

### [73] [Reparameterizing 4DVAR with neural fields](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21751)
*Jaemin Oh*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出基于神经场的4DVAR重新参数化方法，将时空状态表示为神经网络参数化的连续函数，实现并行时间优化，无需真实状态数据即可获得更稳定的初始条件估计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统4DVAR代价函数优化困难且计算密集，存在时间序列依赖性问题，需要开发更高效稳定的数据同化方法。

Method: 使用神经网络参数化时空状态为连续函数，通过物理约束损失函数直接融入物理规律，实现参数空间中的并行时间优化。

Result: 在二维不可压缩Navier-Stokes方程测试中，相比基线4DVAR，该方法产生更稳定的初始条件估计，无虚假振荡，且计算成本更低。

Conclusion: 神经场重新参数化方法为4DVAR提供了有效的替代方案，具有更好的稳定性、并行性和适用性，特别适合缺乏参考数据的场景。

Abstract: Four-dimensional variational data assimilation (4DVAR) is a cornerstone of
numerical weather prediction, but its cost function is difficult to optimize
and computationally intensive. We propose a neural field-based reformulation in
which the full spatiotemporal state is represented as a continuous function
parameterized by a neural network. This reparameterization removes the
time-sequential dependency of classical 4DVAR, enabling parallel-in-time
optimization in parameter space. Physical constraints are incorporated directly
through a physics-informed loss, simplifying implementation and reducing
computational cost. We evaluate the method on the two-dimensional
incompressible Navier--Stokes equations with Kolmogorov forcing. Compared to a
baseline 4DVAR implementation, the neural reparameterized variants produce more
stable initial condition estimates without spurious oscillations. Notably,
unlike most machine learning-based approaches, our framework does not require
access to ground-truth states or reanalysis data, broadening its applicability
to settings with limited reference information.

TL;DR: 使用fNIRS和机器学习检测多发性硬化症患者手部灵巧任务中的脑活动生物标志物，发现MS患者在上缘/角回和中央前回区域活动抑制，脱氧血红蛋白是更好的预测指标


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多发性硬化症患者常报告手部灵巧性和认知疲劳问题，但损伤往往细微难以检测，需要寻找能够解释主观认知疲劳报告的脑活动生物标志物

Method: 招募15名MS患者和12名对照，完成单任务和双任务手部灵巧测试，使用fNIRS测量前额叶和感觉运动皮层血流动力学反应，采用机器学习框架分析数据

Result: K近邻分类器在单任务中准确率达75.0%，双任务中66.7%；XAI显示最重要的脑区是上缘/角回和中央前回，MS组活动抑制且神经血管反应较慢；脱氧血红蛋白比氧合血红蛋白是更好的预测指标

Conclusion: 这种非传统的fNIRS数据分析方法揭示了新的脑活动生物标志物，有助于开发个性化脑刺激靶点

Abstract: People with Multiple Sclerosis (MS) complain of problems with hand dexterity
and cognitive fatigue. However, in many cases, impairments are subtle and
difficult to detect. Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) is a
non-invasive neuroimaging technique that measures brain hemodynamic responses
during cognitive or motor tasks. We aimed to detect brain activity biomarkers
that could explain subjective reports of cognitive fatigue while completing
dexterous tasks and provide targets for future brain stimulation treatments. We
recruited 15 people with MS who did not have a hand (Nine Hole Peg Test
[NHPT]), mobility, or cognitive impairment, and 12 age- and sex-matched
controls. Participants completed two types of hand dexterity tasks with their
dominant hand, single task and dual task (NHPT while holding a ball between the
fifth finger and hypothenar eminence of the same hand). We analyzed fNIRS data
(oxygenated and deoxygenated hemoglobin levels) using a machine learning
framework to classify MS patients from controls based on their brain activation
patterns in bilateral prefrontal and sensorimotor cortices. The K-Nearest
Neighbor classifier achieved an accuracy of 75.0% for single manual dexterity
tasks and 66.7% for the more complex dual manual dexterity tasks. Using XAI, we
found that the most important brain regions contributing to the machine
learning model were the supramarginal/angular gyri and the precentral gyrus
(sensory integration and motor regions) of the ipsilateral hemisphere, with
suppressed activity and slower neurovascular response in the MS group. During
both tasks, deoxygenated hemoglobin levels were better predictors than the
conventional measure of oxygenated hemoglobin. This nonconventional method of
fNIRS data analysis revealed novel brain activity biomarkers that can help
develop personalized brain stimulation targets.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出有效信息准则(EIC)来评估符号回归发现的公式的结构合理性，通过分析公式作为信息处理系统在数值精度下的稳定性，能更好反映公式的可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有符号回归方法仅使用复杂度指标作为可解释性的代理，只考虑公式大小而忽略内部数学结构，导致发现的公式虽然形式紧凑但结构难以分析。

Method: 提出有效信息准则(EIC)，将公式视为具有特定内部结构的信息处理系统，通过数据流经系统时的有效数字损失或舍入噪声放大来识别不合理结构。

Result: EIC与搜索式符号回归算法结合改善了Pareto前沿性能并减少了结果中的不合理结构；与生成式算法结合将预训练所需样本数减少了2-4倍；与人类专家对公式可解释性偏好的吻合度达70.2%。

Conclusion: EIC通过衡量公式中的不合理结构，实际上反映了公式的可解释性，为符号回归提供了一种更有效的结构合理性评估标准。

Abstract: Symbolic regression discovers accurate and interpretable formulas to describe
given data, thereby providing scientific insights for domain experts and
promoting scientific discovery. However, existing symbolic regression methods
often use complexity metrics as a proxy for interoperability, which only
considers the size of the formula but ignores its internal mathematical
structure. Therefore, while they can discover formulas with compact forms, the
discovered formulas often have structures that are difficult to analyze or
interpret mathematically. In this work, inspired by the observation that
physical formulas are typically numerically stable under limited calculation
precision, we propose the Effective Information Criterion (EIC). It treats
formulas as information processing systems with specific internal structures
and identifies the unreasonable structure in them by the loss of significant
digits or the amplification of rounding noise as data flows through the system.
We find that this criterion reveals the gap between the structural rationality
of models discovered by existing symbolic regression algorithms and real-world
physical formulas. Combining EIC with various search-based symbolic regression
algorithms improves their performance on the Pareto frontier and reduces the
irrational structure in the results. Combining EIC with generative-based
algorithms reduces the number of samples required for pre-training, improving
sample efficiency by 2~4 times. Finally, for different formulas with similar
accuracy and complexity, EIC shows a 70.2% agreement with 108 human experts'
preferences for formula interpretability, demonstrating that EIC, by measuring
the unreasonable structures in formulas, actually reflects the formula's
interpretability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GRPO在提升大语言模型推理能力方面潜力巨大，但其实际部署受到训练过程过慢的限制，主要原因是每个查询需要自回归生成多个响应的计算密集型过程。

Method: 采用并发感知的推测解码框架，根据实时并发水平动态调整草稿和验证策略，并引入在线草稿学习机制使草稿模型能够持续适应目标模型的变化。

Result: 在多个数学推理数据集和模型上的实验结果表明，该方法实现了2.35倍到2.72倍的端到端加速，显著超越了基线方法的效率。

Conclusion: 所提出的方法有效解决了GRPO训练中的性能瓶颈问题，为加速大语言模型推理能力的强化学习训练提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Group relative policy optimization (GRPO) has demonstrated significant
potential in improving the reasoning capabilities of large language models
(LLMs) via reinforcement learning. However, its practical deployment is impeded
by an excessively slow training process, primarily attributed to the
computationally intensive autoregressive generation of multiple responses per
query, which makes the generation phase the primary performance bottleneck.
Although speculative decoding presents a promising direction for acceleration,
its direct application in GRPO achieves limited speedup under high-concurrency
training conditions. To overcome this limitation, we propose a
concurrency-aware speculative decoding framework that dynamically adjusts the
drafting and verification strategy according to real-time concurrency levels,
thereby maximizing the acceleration of the generation process. Furthermore, to
address performance degradation arising from distributional drift between the
evolving target model and the fixed draft model during training, we introduce
an online draft learning mechanism that enables the draft model to continuously
adapt using feedback signals from the target model. Experimental results across
multiple mathematical reasoning datasets and models demonstrate that the
proposed method achieves end-to-end speedups of 2.35x to 2.72x, significantly
surpassing baseline approaches in efficiency. The code is available at

Abstract: Fatigue detection using physiological signals is critical in domains such as

focus on single modalities, this work examines statistical relationships
between signal pairs to improve classification robustness. Using the DROZY
dataset, we extracted features from ECG, EMG, EOG, and EEG across 15 signal
combinations and evaluated them with Decision Tree, Random Forest, Logistic
Regression, and XGBoost. Results show that XGBoost with the EMG EEG combination
achieved the best performance. SHAP analysis highlighted ECG EOG correlation as
a key feature, and multi signal models consistently outperformed single signal
ones. These findings demonstrate that feature level fusion of physiological
signals enhances accuracy, interpretability, and practical applicability of
fatigue monitoring systems.

TL;DR: 提出了ChaosNexus基础模型，通过多尺度架构和专家混合层，在混沌系统预测中实现了卓越的零样本泛化能力，在合成和真实世界基准测试中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 混沌系统（如天气预报、流体动力学）对初始条件高度敏感且观测数据稀缺，传统模型缺乏泛化能力，无法应对现实世界中需要零样本或少样本预测的新场景。

Method: ChaosNexus基础模型，采用名为ScaleFormer的多尺度架构，结合专家混合层，在多样化混沌动态语料库上进行预训练，以捕捉通用模式和系统特定行为。

Result: 在包含9000多个合成混沌系统的大规模测试平台上，长期吸引子统计保真度比领先基线提高40%以上；在5天全球天气预报中，零样本平均误差低于1度，少样本微调后进一步改善。

Conclusion: ChaosNexus的扩展行为表明，科学基础模型的跨系统泛化能力源于训练系统的多样性，而非单纯的数据量。

Abstract: Accurately forecasting chaotic systems, prevalent in domains such as weather
prediction and fluid dynamics, remains a significant scientific challenge. The
inherent sensitivity of these systems to initial conditions, coupled with a
scarcity of observational data, severely constrains traditional modeling
approaches. Since these models are typically trained for a specific system,
they lack the generalization capacity necessary for real-world applications,
which demand robust zero-shot or few-shot forecasting on novel or data-limited
scenarios. To overcome this generalization barrier, we propose ChaosNexus, a
foundation model pre-trained on a diverse corpus of chaotic dynamics.
ChaosNexus employs a novel multi-scale architecture named ScaleFormer augmented
with Mixture-of-Experts layers, to capture both universal patterns and
system-specific behaviors. The model demonstrates state-of-the-art zero-shot
generalization across both synthetic and real-world benchmarks. On a
large-scale testbed comprising over 9,000 synthetic chaotic systems, it
improves the fidelity of long-term attractor statistics by more than 40%
compared to the leading baseline. This robust performance extends to real-world
applications with exceptional data efficiency. For instance, in 5-day global
weather forecasting, ChaosNexus achieves a competitive zero-shot mean error
below 1 degree, a result that further improves with few-shot fine-tuning.
Moreover, experiments on the scaling behavior of ChaosNexus provide a guiding
principle for scientific foundation models: cross-system generalization stems
from the diversity of training systems, rather than sheer data volume.

Motivation: 预测材料属性对于设计更好的电池、半导体和医疗设备至关重要，深度学习可以帮助科学家快速找到有前景的材料。公司在大规模深度学习模型上投入巨资，但需要了解如何有效扩展这些模型。

Method: 训练了transformer和EquiformerV2神经网络来预测材料属性，分析了训练数据规模、模型大小和计算资源三个超参数对性能的影响，发现了幂律缩放关系L = α·N^(-β)。

Result: 发现了经验性的缩放规律，能够预测增加训练数据、模型大小和计算资源对预测性能的影响，并提供了命令行参数来改变训练设置。

Conclusion: 未来工作可以进一步研究其他神经网络模型（如GemNet和全连接网络）在该领域的缩放规律，以评估它们与所训练模型的比较。

Abstract: Predicting material properties is crucial for designing better batteries,
semiconductors, and medical devices. Deep learning helps scientists quickly
find promising materials by predicting their energy, forces, and stresses.
Companies scale capacities of deep learning models in multiple domains, such as
language modeling, and invest many millions of dollars into such models. Our
team analyzes how scaling training data (giving models more information to
learn from), model sizes (giving models more capacity to learn patterns), and
compute (giving models more computational resources) for neural networks
affects their performance for material property prediction. In particular, we
trained both transformer and EquiformerV2 neural networks to predict material
properties. We find empirical scaling laws for these models: we can predict how
increasing each of the three hyperparameters (training data, model size, and
compute) affects predictive performance. In particular, the loss $L$ can be
measured with a power law relationship $L = \alpha \cdot N^{-\beta}$, where
$\alpha$ and $\beta$ are constants while $N$ is the relevant hyperparameter. We
also incorporate command-line arguments for changing training settings such as
the amount of epochs, maximum learning rate, and whether mixed precision is
enabled. Future work could entail further investigating scaling laws for other
neural network models in this domain, such as GemNet and fully connected
networks, to assess how they compare to the models we trained.

Motivation: 虽然SAM方法通常能引导训练找到更平坦的极小值点以提升泛化能力，但研究发现该方法可能收敛到虚假的极小值点。

Method: 理论证明虚假极小值点的存在性，建立局部收敛条件，并通过实验验证实际收敛现象，最后提出简单有效的避免方法。

Result: 证实了SAM确实可能收敛到虚假极小值点，这些点不是原始目标函数的真正极小值。

Conclusion: SAM方法存在收敛到虚假极小值点的风险，需要采取适当措施来避免这种现象。

Abstract: Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM) is a widely used method that steers
training toward flatter minimizers, which typically generalize better. In this
work, however, we show that SAM can converge to hallucinated minimizers --
points that are not minimizers of the original objective. We theoretically
prove the existence of such hallucinated minimizers and establish conditions
for local convergence to them. We further provide empirical evidence
demonstrating that SAM can indeed converge to these points in practice.
Finally, we propose a simple yet effective remedy for avoiding hallucinated
minimizers.

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了在线多智能体强化学习中的稀疏奖励挑战，展示了优越的性能表现。

Abstract: We study the problem of online multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) in
environments with sparse rewards, where reward feedback is not provided at each
interaction but only revealed at the end of a trajectory. This setting, though
realistic, presents a fundamental challenge: the lack of intermediate rewards
hinders standard MARL algorithms from effectively guiding policy learning. To
address this issue, we propose a novel framework that integrates online inverse
preference learning with multi-agent on-policy optimization into a unified
architecture. At its core, our approach introduces an implicit multi-agent
reward learning model, built upon a preference-based value-decomposition
network, which produces both global and local reward signals. These signals are
further used to construct dual advantage streams, enabling differentiated
learning targets for the centralized critic and decentralized actors. In
addition, we demonstrate how large language models (LLMs) can be leveraged to
provide preference labels that enhance the quality of the learned reward model.
Empirical evaluations on state-of-the-art benchmarks, including MAMuJoCo and
SMACv2, show that our method achieves superior performance compared to existing
baselines, highlighting its effectiveness in addressing sparse-reward
challenges in online MARL.

TL;DR: 本文对掩码离散扩散进行了理论分析，提出了MATU方法，在保持无偏离散分数近似的同时消除了有界分数假设，获得了接近ε无关的复杂度O(d ln d·(1-ε²))，显著优于均匀离散扩散。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 掩码离散扩散在文本生成中表现出强大的经验性能，但其在高维设置下的理论复杂性理解不足。现有分析主要集中在均匀离散扩散，对掩码扩散的分析要么忽略了广泛使用的欧拉采样器，要么施加了限制性的有界分数假设，或者未能展示掩码离散扩散相对于均匀扩散的优势。

Method: 首先证明了欧拉采样器可以在总变差距离上达到ε精度，需要Õ(d²ε⁻³/²)次离散分数评估。然后提出了掩码感知截断均匀化(MATU)方法，该方法既移除了有界分数假设，又保持了无偏离散分数近似，利用每个token最多只能被解掩码一次的特性。

Result: MATU方法获得了接近ε无关的复杂度O(d ln d·(1-ε²))，超越了均匀离散扩散下的现有均匀化方法，消除了ln(1/ε)因子并显著加速了收敛。

Conclusion: 研究结果为掩码离散扩散提供了严格的理论基础，展示了其在文本生成中相对于均匀扩散的实际优势，并为分析在掩码范式下开发的基于扩散的语言模型铺平了道路。

Abstract: We study masked discrete diffusion -- a flexible paradigm for text generation
in which tokens are progressively corrupted by special mask symbols before
being denoised. Although this approach has demonstrated strong empirical
performance, its theoretical complexity in high-dimensional settings remains
insufficiently understood. Existing analyses largely focus on uniform discrete
diffusion, and more recent attempts addressing masked diffusion either (1)
overlook widely used Euler samplers, (2) impose restrictive bounded-score
assumptions, or (3) fail to showcase the advantages of masked discrete
diffusion over its uniform counterpart. To address this gap, we show that Euler
samplers can achieve $\epsilon$-accuracy in total variation (TV) with
$\tilde{O}(d^{2}\epsilon^{-3/2})$ discrete score evaluations, thereby providing
the first rigorous analysis of typical Euler sampler in masked discrete
diffusion. We then propose a Mask-Aware Truncated Uniformization (MATU)
approach that both removes bounded-score assumptions and preserves unbiased
discrete score approximation. By exploiting the property that each token can be
unmasked at most once, MATU attains a nearly $\epsilon$-free complexity of
$O(d\,\ln d\cdot (1-\epsilon^2))$. This result surpasses existing
uniformization methods under uniform discrete diffusion, eliminating the
$\ln(1/\epsilon)$ factor and substantially speeding up convergence. Our
findings not only provide a rigorous theoretical foundation for masked discrete
diffusion, showcasing its practical advantages over uniform diffusion for text
generation, but also pave the way for future efforts to analyze diffusion-based
language models developed under masking paradigm.

Conclusion: 该框架为草图双线性形式提供了统一分析工具，在联邦学习和多臂老虎机等应用中获得了优于维度依赖边界的改进结果，证明了基于几何复杂度的分析方法的有效性。

Abstract: Uniform bounds on sketched inner products of vectors or matrices underpin
several important computational and statistical results in machine learning and
randomized algorithms, including the Johnson-Lindenstrauss (J-L) lemma, the
Restricted Isometry Property (RIP), randomized sketching, and approximate
linear algebra. However, many modern analyses involve *sketched bilinear
forms*, for which existing uniform bounds either do not apply or are not sharp
on general sets. In this work, we develop a general framework to analyze such
sketched bilinear forms and derive uniform bounds in terms of geometric
complexities of the associated sets. Our approach relies on generic chaining
and introduces new techniques for handling suprema over pairs of sets. We
further extend these results to the setting where the bilinear form involves a
sum of $T$ independent sketching matrices and show that the deviation scales as
$\sqrt{T}$. This unified analysis recovers known results such as the J-L lemma
as special cases, while extending RIP-type guarantees. Additionally, we obtain
improved convergence bounds for sketched Federated Learning algorithms where
such cross terms arise naturally due to sketched gradient compression, and
design sketched variants of bandit algorithms with sharper regret bounds that
depend on the geometric complexity of the action and parameter sets, rather
than the ambient dimension.

Result: 在六个文档问答基准测试中，GoA将检索增强生成的平均F1分数提升了5.7%，比使用固定协作结构的多代理基线提升了16.35%。仅使用2K上下文窗口的GoA在LongBench上超越了128K上下文窗口的Llama 3.1 8B。

Conclusion: GoA框架通过信息论压缩方法显著提高了多代理系统的长上下文建模能力，有效扩展了模型的上下文处理长度。

Abstract: As a model-agnostic approach to long context modeling, multi-agent systems
can process inputs longer than a large language model's context window without
retraining or architectural modifications. However, their performance often
heavily relies on hand-crafted multi-agent collaboration strategies and prompt
engineering, which limit generalizability. In this work, we introduce a
principled framework that formalizes the model-agnostic long context modeling
problem as a compression problem, yielding an information-theoretic compression
objective. Building on this framework, we propose Graph of Agents (GoA), which
dynamically constructs an input-dependent collaboration structure that
maximizes this objective. For Llama 3.1 8B and Qwen3 8B across six document
question answering benchmarks, GoA improves the average $F_1$ score of
retrieval-augmented generation by 5.7\% and a strong multi-agent baseline using
a fixed collaboration structure by 16.35\%, respectively. Even with only a 2K
context window, GoA surpasses the 128K context window Llama 3.1 8B on
LongBench, showing a dramatic increase in effective context length. Our source

Abstract: Recent advances in molecular foundation models have shown impressive
performance in molecular property prediction and de novo molecular design, with
promising applications in areas such as drug discovery and reaction prediction.
Nevertheless, most existing approaches rely exclusively on SMILES
representations and overlook both experimental spectra and 3D structural

where stereochemistry, spatial conformation, and experimental validation are
critical. To overcome these challenges, we propose MolSpectLLM, a molecular
foundation model pretrained on Qwen2.5-7B that unifies experimental
spectroscopy with molecular 3D structure. By explicitly modeling molecular
spectra, MolSpectLLM achieves state-of-the-art performance on spectrum-related
tasks, with an average accuracy of 0.53 across NMR, IR, and MS benchmarks.
MolSpectLLM also shows strong performance on the spectra analysis task,
obtaining 15.5% sequence accuracy and 41.7% token accuracy on
Spectra-to-SMILES, substantially outperforming large general-purpose LLMs. More
importantly, MolSpectLLM not only achieves strong performance on molecular
elucidation tasks, but also generates accurate 3D molecular structures directly
from SMILES or spectral inputs, bridging spectral analysis, molecular
elucidation, and molecular design.

TL;DR: 提出LDAR（学习分散注意力感知检索）方法，通过自适应检索来减轻干扰性段落的影响，相比长上下文方法在减少token使用的同时显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然大上下文窗口LLMs可以直接处理完整文档，但存在token效率低、"中间迷失"现象加剧、模型容量有限时干扰增强等问题，导致输出质量下降。

Method: LDAR是一种自适应检索器，学习检索能够减轻干扰性段落干扰的上下文，平衡信息覆盖与干扰之间的权衡。

Result: 在多种LLM架构和六个知识密集型基准测试上的广泛实验证明了该方法的有效性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: LDAR方法在减少token使用的同时显著提升性能，强调了平衡信息覆盖与干扰之间权衡的重要性。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a framework for grounding Large
Language Models (LLMs) in external, up-to-date information. However, recent
advancements in context window size allow LLMs to process inputs of up to 128K
tokens or more, offering an alternative strategy: supplying the full document
context directly to the model, rather than relying on RAG to retrieve a subset
of contexts. Nevertheless, this emerging alternative strategy has notable
limitations: (i) it is token-inefficient to handle large and potentially
redundant contexts; (ii) it exacerbates the `lost in the middle' phenomenon;
and (iii) under limited model capacity, it amplifies distraction, ultimately
degrading LLM output quality. In this paper, we propose LDAR (Learning
Distraction-Aware Retrieval), an adaptive retriever that learns to retrieve
contexts in a way that mitigates interference from distracting passages,
thereby achieving significantly higher performance with reduced token usage
compared to long-context approaches. Extensive experiments across diverse LLM
architectures and six knowledge-intensive benchmarks demonstrate the
effectiveness and robustness of our approach, highlighting the importance of
balancing the trade-off between information coverage and distraction.

TL;DR: ILP-CoT方法结合了归纳逻辑编程和多模态大语言模型，用于归纳逻辑规则。它利用MLLMs提出规则结构，然后通过ILP系统进行精确推理，解决了单独使用ILP或MLLMs时的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决单独使用ILP需要指定背景知识且计算成本高，以及单独使用MLLMs存在感知幻觉的问题，通过结合两者的优势来实现更好的逻辑规则归纳。

Method: 基于MLLMs提出结构正确的规则，自动构建ILP任务并修剪搜索空间，然后使用ILP系统基于修正的逻辑事实和形式归纳推理输出规则。

Result: 在具有挑战性的逻辑归纳基准测试中验证了有效性，并展示了在文本到图像定制生成中的应用潜力。

Conclusion: ILP-CoT成功地将ILP和MLLMs结合起来，克服了各自的局限性，实现了更有效的逻辑规则归纳。

Abstract: We propose ILP-CoT, a method that bridges Inductive Logic Programming (ILP)
and Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) for abductive logical rule
induction. The task involves both discovering logical facts and inducing
logical rules from a small number of unstructured textual or visual inputs,
which still remain challenging when solely relying on ILP, due to the
requirement of specified background knowledge and high computational cost, or
MLLMs, due to the appearance of perceptual hallucinations. Based on the key
observation that MLLMs could propose structure-correct rules even under
hallucinations, our approach automatically builds ILP tasks with pruned search
spaces based on the rule structure proposals from MLLMs, and utilizes ILP
system to output rules built upon rectified logical facts and formal inductive
reasoning. Its effectiveness is verified through challenging logical induction
benchmarks, as well as a potential application of our approach, namely
text-to-image customized generation with rule induction. Our code and data are
released at https://github.com/future-item/ILP-CoT.

*Chaoyang Luo,Yan Zou,Nanjing Huang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Zubov-Net是一个自适应稳定学习框架，通过将Zubov方程重新表述为吸引域与预设吸引域之间的一致性表征，解决了神经网络ODE中鲁棒性与准确性的权衡问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管神经ODE由于其动力学系统特性在输入扰动下具有内在鲁棒性，但现有方法往往需要施加Lyapunov稳定性条件来提供形式化鲁棒性保证，这导致了鲁棒性与准确性之间的紧张关系。

Method: 提出基于Zubov方程的一致性表征框架，通过三方损失（一致性、分类和分离损失）和并行边界采样算法共同优化神经ODE和Lyapunov函数，并设计了基于输入注意力的凸神经网络来增强Lyapunov函数的判别性。

Result: 实验表明，Zubov-Net在保持高分类准确性的同时，显著提高了对各种随机噪声和对抗攻击的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: Zubov-Net通过主动控制吸引域几何形状来协调准确性和鲁棒性，为神经ODE提供了有效的稳定学习框架。

Abstract: Despite neural ordinary differential equations (Neural ODEs) exhibiting
intrinsic robustness under input perturbations due to their dynamical systems
nature, recent approaches often involve imposing Lyapunov-based stability
conditions to provide formal robustness guarantees. However, a fundamental
challenge remains: the tension between robustness and accuracy, primarily
stemming from the difficulty in imposing appropriate stability conditions. To
address this, we propose an adaptive stable learning framework named Zubov-Net,
which innovatively reformulates Zubov's equation into a consistency
characterization between regions of attraction (RoAs) and prescribed RoAs
(PRoAs). Building on this consistency, we introduce a new paradigm for actively
controlling the geometry of RoAs by directly optimizing PRoAs to reconcile
accuracy and robustness. Our approach is realized through tripartite losses
(consistency, classification, and separation losses) and a parallel boundary
sampling algorithm that co-optimizes the Neural ODE and the Lyapunov function.
To enhance the discriminativity of Lyapunov functions, we design an
input-attention-based convex neural network via a softmax attention mechanism
that focuses on equilibrium-relevant features and also serves as weight
normalization to maintain training stability in deep architectures.
Theoretically, we prove that minimizing the tripartite loss guarantees
consistent alignment of PRoAs-RoAs, trajectory stability, and non-overlapping
PRoAs. Moreover, we establish stochastic convex separability with tighter
probability bounds and fewer dimensionality requirements to justify the convex
design in Lyapunov functions. Experimentally, Zubov-Net maintains high
classification accuracy while significantly improving robustness against
various stochastic noises and adversarial attacks.

Motivation: 验证RLVR方法在实际应用中的真实效果，探究其收益是否被夸大，以及是否存在隐藏成本（RLVR税收）。

Conclusion: RLVR具有价值且适合工业应用，但需要保持其实用优势的同时，优先考虑可靠性、安全性和测量准确性。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) is a practical and
scalable approach to enhancing large language models in areas such as math,
code, and other structured tasks. Two questions motivate this paper: how much
of the reported gains survive under strictly parity-controlled evaluation, and
whether RLVR is cost-free or exacts a measurable tax. We argue that progress is
real, but gains are often overstated due to three forces - an RLVR tax,
evaluation pitfalls, and data contamination. Using a partial-prompt
contamination audit and matched-budget reproductions across base and RL models,
we show that several headline gaps shrink or vanish under clean,
parity-controlled evaluation. We then propose a tax-aware training and
evaluation protocol that co-optimizes accuracy, grounding, and calibrated
abstention and standardizes budgeting and provenance checks. Applied to recent
RLVR setups, this protocol yields more reliable estimates of reasoning gains
and, in several cases, revises prior conclusions. Our position is constructive:
RLVR is valuable and industry-ready; we advocate keeping its practical benefits
while prioritizing reliability, safety, and measurement.

Motivation: 现有Rademacher复杂度界限只能应用于有限类型的模型，无法充分解释为什么具有高秩权重矩阵的深度神经网络模型能够良好泛化。

Method: 引入神经网络的代数表示和核函数来构建RKHS，结合Koopman算子和群表示理论推导新的复杂度界限。

Result: 推导出了适用于更广泛现实模型的Rademacher复杂度界限，为基于Koopman理论的复杂度界限在更实际场景下的有效性铺平了道路。

Conclusion: 所提出的界限能够解释高秩权重矩阵模型泛化良好的现象，扩展了现有理论的应用范围，使Koopman理论在更实际情况下有效。

Abstract: We derive a new Rademacher complexity bound for deep neural networks using
Koopman operators, group representations, and reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces
(RKHSs). The proposed bound describes why the models with high-rank weight
matrices generalize well. Although there are existing bounds that attempt to
describe this phenomenon, these existing bounds can be applied to limited types
of models. We introduce an algebraic representation of neural networks and a
kernel function to construct an RKHS to derive a bound for a wider range of
realistic models. This work paves the way for the Koopman-based theory for
Rademacher complexity bounds to be valid for more practical situations.

Motivation: 发现oracle解通常与先前任务最优解保持低损失的线性连接，这为解决灾难性遗忘提供了新思路

Method: IVT框架周期性地将模型参数传送到保持与先前任务最优解线性连接性的变换解，使用对角Fisher信息矩阵高效近似变换

Result: 在多个数据集上显著提升CIL基线性能，CIFAR-100上PASS基线最终准确率提升+5.12%，FGVCAircraft上CLIP预训练SLCA基线平均准确率提升+14.93%

Conclusion: IVT是有效的即插即用框架，能稳定保持先前任务性能，适用于无示例和有示例场景，与多种初始化策略兼容

Abstract: Class Incremental Learning (CIL) aims to sequentially acquire knowledge of
new classes without forgetting previously learned ones. Despite recent
progress, current CIL methods still exhibit significant performance gaps
compared to their oracle counterparts-models trained with full access to
historical data. Inspired by recent insights on Linear Mode Connectivity (LMC),
we revisit the geometric properties of oracle solutions in CIL and uncover a
fundamental observation: these oracle solutions typically maintain low-loss
linear connections to the optimum of previous tasks. Motivated by this finding,
we propose Increment Vector Transformation (IVT), a novel plug-and-play
framework designed to mitigate catastrophic forgetting during training. Rather
than directly following CIL updates, IVT periodically teleports the model
parameters to transformed solutions that preserve linear connectivity to
previous task optimum. By maintaining low-loss along these connecting paths,
IVT effectively ensures stable performance on previously learned tasks. The
transformation is efficiently approximated using diagonal Fisher Information
Matrices, making IVT suitable for both exemplar-free and exemplar-based
scenarios, and compatible with various initialization strategies. Extensive
experiments on CIFAR-100, FGVCAircraft, ImageNet-Subset, and ImageNet-Full
demonstrate that IVT consistently enhances the performance of strong CIL
baselines. Specifically, on CIFAR-100, IVT improves the last accuracy of the
PASS baseline by +5.12% and reduces forgetting by 2.54%. For the
CLIP-pre-trained SLCA baseline on FGVCAircraft, IVT yields gains of +14.93% in
average accuracy and +21.95% in last accuracy. The code will be released.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有离散数据引导方法主要基于一阶泰勒近似，但在离散状态空间中近似误差可能很大，需要更精确的引导框架。

Method: 推导期望分布的精确转移率，结合学习的离散流匹配模型，构建统一的引导框架，可应用于掩码扩散模型。

Result: 在能量引导模拟、文本到图像生成的偏好对齐以及多模态理解任务中展示了有效性，显著提高了采样效率。

Conclusion: 提出的离散引导匹配框架为离散数据提供了一种高效且精确的采样方法，统一了现有引导方法，并在多个任务中表现出优越性能。

Abstract: Guidance provides a simple and effective framework for posterior sampling by
steering the generation process towards the desired distribution. When modeling
discrete data, existing approaches mostly focus on guidance with the
first-order Taylor approximation to improve the sampling efficiency. However,
such an approximation is inappropriate in discrete state spaces since the
approximation error could be large. A novel guidance framework for discrete
data is proposed to address this problem: We derive the exact transition rate
for the desired distribution given a learned discrete flow matching model,
leading to guidance that only requires a single forward pass in each sampling
step, significantly improving efficiency. This unified novel framework is
general enough, encompassing existing guidance methods as special cases, and it
can also be seamlessly applied to the masked diffusion model. We demonstrate
the effectiveness of our proposed guidance on energy-guided simulations and
preference alignment on text-to-image generation and multimodal understanding
tasks. The code is available through

*Fumin Wang*

TL;DR: 提出了Multiplicative-Additive Constrained Models (MACMs)，结合了乘法模型和加法模型的优点，在保持可解释性的同时提升了预测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在高风险领域如医疗保健中，机器学习模型的可解释性至关重要。GAMs虽然可解释但忽略了高阶交互效应，CESR包含全特征交互但性能不如GAMs，需要一种既能保持可解释性又能提升性能的模型。

Method: MACMs由乘法部分和加法部分组成，通过引入加法部分来解耦CESR中交互项和独立项的系数，从而扩展假设空间。两个部分的形状函数都可以自然可视化。

Result: 基于神经网络的MACMs在预测性能上显著优于CESR和当前最先进的GAMs。

Conclusion: MACMs在保持可解释性的同时，通过结合乘法和加法结构有效提升了预测性能，是对CESR和GAMs的改进。

Abstract: Interpretability is one of the considerations when applying machine learning
to high-stakes fields such as healthcare that involve matters of life safety.
Generalized Additive Models (GAMs) enhance interpretability by visualizing
shape functions. Nevertheless, to preserve interpretability, GAMs omit
higher-order interaction effects (beyond pairwise interactions), which imposes
significant constraints on their predictive performance. We observe that Curve
Ergodic Set Regression (CESR), a multiplicative model, naturally enables the
visualization of its shape functions and simultaneously incorporates both
interactions among all features and individual feature effects. Nevertheless,
CESR fails to demonstrate superior performance compared to GAMs. We introduce
Multiplicative-Additive Constrained Models (MACMs), which augment CESR with an
additive part to disentangle the intertwined coefficients of its interactive
and independent terms, thus effectively broadening the hypothesis space. The
model is composed of a multiplicative part and an additive part, whose shape
functions can both be naturally visualized, thereby assisting users in
interpreting how features participate in the decision-making process.
Consequently, MACMs constitute an improvement over both CESR and GAMs. The
experimental results indicate that neural network-based MACMs significantly
outperform both CESR and the current state-of-the-art GAMs in terms of
predictive performance.

Conclusion: 实验验证了理论分析，在生成任务和分类等下游任务中支持了理论结果，为理解有限样本下生成模型的行为提供了理论依据。

Abstract: This paper investigates the theoretical behavior of generative models under
finite training populations. Within the stochastic interpolation generative
framework, we derive closed-form expressions for the optimal velocity field and
score function when only a finite number of training samples are available. We
demonstrate that, under some regularity conditions, the deterministic
generative process exactly recovers the training samples, while the stochastic
generative process manifests as training samples with added Gaussian noise.
Beyond the idealized setting, we consider model estimation errors and introduce
formal definitions of underfitting and overfitting specific to generative
models. Our theoretical analysis reveals that, in the presence of estimation
errors, the stochastic generation process effectively produces convex
combinations of training samples corrupted by a mixture of uniform and Gaussian
noise. Experiments on generation tasks and downstream tasks such as
classification support our theory.

Conclusion: 该工作连接了时间序列分析和可视化，为能源分析提供了可扩展且可解释的框架。

Abstract: The analysis of complex building time-series for actionable insights and
recommendations remains challenging due to the nonlinear and multi-scale
characteristics of energy data. To address this, we propose a framework that
fine-tunes visual language large models (VLLMs) on 3D graphical representations
of the data. The approach converts 1D time-series into 3D representations using
continuous wavelet transforms (CWTs) and recurrence plots (RPs), which capture
temporal dynamics and localize frequency anomalies. These 3D encodings enable
VLLMs to visually interpret energy-consumption patterns, detect anomalies, and
provide recommendations for energy efficiency. We demonstrate the framework on
real-world building-energy datasets, where fine-tuned VLLMs successfully
monitor building states, identify recurring anomalies, and generate
optimization recommendations. Quantitatively, the Idefics-7B VLLM achieves
validation losses of 0.0952 with CWTs and 0.1064 with RPs on the University of
Sharjah energy dataset, outperforming direct fine-tuning on raw time-series
data (0.1176) for anomaly detection. This work bridges time-series analysis and
visualization, providing a scalable and interpretable framework for energy
analytics.

Result: 在总体水平上，softmax达到贝叶斯风险，而线性注意力存在根本性不足；在有限样本情况下，softmax虽非贝叶斯最优但仍优于线性注意力。

Conclusion: softmax在注意力机制中具有优越性，能够达到最优性能，而线性注意力存在根本性限制，研究还探讨了与基于梯度优化算法的联系。

Abstract: Large language models rely on attention mechanisms with a softmax activation.
Yet the dominance of softmax over alternatives (e.g., component-wise or linear)
remains poorly understood, and many theoretical works have focused on the
easier-to-analyze linearized attention. In this work, we address this gap
through a principled study of the single-location regression task, where the
output depends on a linear transformation of a single input token at a random
location. Building on ideas from statistical physics, we develop an analysis of
attention-based predictors in the high-dimensional limit, where generalization
performance is captured by a small set of order parameters. At the population
level, we show that softmax achieves the Bayes risk, whereas linear attention
fundamentally falls short. We then examine other activation functions to
identify which properties are necessary for optimal performance. Finally, we
analyze the finite-sample regime: we provide an asymptotic characterization of
the test error and show that, while softmax is no longer Bayes-optimal, it
consistently outperforms linear attention. We discuss the connection with
optimization by gradient-based algorithms.

Conclusion: SIHD框架通过自适应层次结构和结构信息利用，有效解决了长时程稀疏奖励环境中的离线策略学习问题。

Abstract: Diffusion-based generative methods have shown promising potential for
modeling trajectories from offline reinforcement learning (RL) datasets, and
hierarchical diffusion has been introduced to mitigate variance accumulation
and computational challenges in long-horizon planning tasks. However, existing
approaches typically assume a fixed two-layer diffusion hierarchy with a single
predefined temporal scale, which limits adaptability to diverse downstream
tasks and reduces flexibility in decision making. In this work, we propose
SIHD, a novel Structural Information-based Hierarchical Diffusion framework for
effective and stable offline policy learning in long-horizon environments with
sparse rewards. Specifically, we analyze structural information embedded in
offline trajectories to construct the diffusion hierarchy adaptively, enabling
flexible trajectory modeling across multiple temporal scales. Rather than
relying on reward predictions from localized sub-trajectories, we quantify the
structural information gain of each state community and use it as a
conditioning signal within the corresponding diffusion layer. To reduce
overreliance on offline datasets, we introduce a structural entropy regularizer
that encourages exploration of underrepresented states while avoiding
extrapolation errors from distributional shifts. Extensive evaluations on
challenging offline RL tasks show that SIHD significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines in decision-making performance and demonstrates
superior generalization across diverse scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于RL的攻击方法在发现高奖励提示后难以探索新区域，导致攻击模式单一。需要一种能自动适应受害者模型变化、持续发现新漏洞的方法。

Method: 使用强化学习训练攻击者LLM，定期用收集的攻击提示对受害者LLM进行安全微调，使已利用区域的奖励减少，迫使攻击者寻找新漏洞。

Result: Active Attacks显著优于现有RL方法，将对抗GFlowNets的跨攻击成功率从0.07%提升至31.28%，计算成本仅增加6%。

Conclusion: Active Attacks通过主动学习机制实现了从易到难的探索课程，能逐步发现广泛的局部攻击模式，有效覆盖多模态分布。

Abstract: We address the challenge of generating diverse attack prompts for large
language models (LLMs) that elicit harmful behaviors (e.g., insults, sexual
content) and are used for safety fine-tuning. Rather than relying on manual
prompt engineering, attacker LLMs can be trained with reinforcement learning
(RL) to automatically generate such prompts using only a toxicity classifier as
a reward. However, capturing a wide range of harmful behaviors is a significant
challenge that requires explicit diversity objectives. Existing
diversity-seeking RL methods often collapse to limited modes: once high-reward
prompts are found, exploration of new regions is discouraged. Inspired by the
active learning paradigm that encourages adaptive exploration, we introduce
\textit{Active Attacks}, a novel RL-based red-teaming algorithm that adapts its
attacks as the victim evolves. By periodically safety fine-tuning the victim
LLM with collected attack prompts, rewards in exploited regions diminish, which
forces the attacker to seek unexplored vulnerabilities. This process naturally
induces an easy-to-hard exploration curriculum, where the attacker progresses
beyond easy modes toward increasingly difficult ones. As a result, Active
Attacks uncovers a wide range of local attack modes step by step, and their
combination achieves wide coverage of the multi-mode distribution. Active
Attacks, a simple plug-and-play module that seamlessly integrates into existing
RL objectives, unexpectedly outperformed prior RL-based methods -- including
GFlowNets, PPO, and REINFORCE -- by improving cross-attack success rates
against GFlowNets, the previous state-of-the-art, from 0.07% to 31.28% (a
relative gain greater than $400\ \times$) with only a 6% increase in

Abstract: Large Audio Language Models (LALMs), powered by the chain-of-thought (CoT)
paradigm, have shown remarkable reasoning capabilities. Intuitively, different
problems often require varying depths of reasoning. While some methods can
determine whether to reason for a given problem, they typically lack a
fine-grained mechanism to modulate how much to reason. This often results in a
``one-size-fits-all'' reasoning depth, which generates redundant overthinking
for simple questions while failing to allocate sufficient thought to complex
ones. In this paper, we conduct an in-depth analysis of LALMs and find that an
effective and efficient LALM should reason smartly by adapting its reasoning
depth to the problem's complexity. To achieve this, we propose a
difficulty-adaptive reasoning method for LALMs. Specifically, we propose a
reward function that dynamically links reasoning length to the model's
perceived problem difficulty. This reward encourages shorter, concise reasoning
for easy tasks and more elaborate, in-depth reasoning for complex ones.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method is both effective and
efficient, simultaneously improving task performance and significantly reducing
the average reasoning length. Further analysis on reasoning structure paradigm
offers valuable insights for future work.

TL;DR: GRAMDTI是一个多模态预训练框架，通过整合小分子和蛋白质的多模态信息来改进药物靶点相互作用预测，采用体积对比学习和自适应模态丢弃技术。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有DTI预测方法主要依赖SMILES-蛋白质对，未能充分利用小分子和蛋白质的多模态信息，限制了预测性能。

Method: 提出GRAMDTI框架，整合多模态分子和蛋白质输入，采用四模态体积对比学习捕获高阶语义对齐，使用自适应模态丢弃动态调节各模态贡献，并引入IC50活性测量作为弱监督。

Result: 在四个公开数据集上的实验表明，GRAMDTI持续优于现有最先进基线方法。

Conclusion: 高阶多模态对齐、自适应模态利用和辅助监督对于构建稳健且可泛化的DTI预测模型具有重要价值。

Abstract: Drug target interaction (DTI) prediction is a cornerstone of computational
drug discovery, enabling rational design, repurposing, and mechanistic
insights. While deep learning has advanced DTI modeling, existing approaches
primarily rely on SMILES protein pairs and fail to exploit the rich multimodal
information available for small molecules and proteins. We introduce GRAMDTI, a
pretraining framework that integrates multimodal molecular and protein inputs
into unified representations. GRAMDTI extends volume based contrastive learning
to four modalities, capturing higher-order semantic alignment beyond
conventional pairwise approaches. To handle modality informativeness, we
propose adaptive modality dropout, dynamically regulating each modality's
contribution during pre-training. Additionally, IC50 activity measurements,
when available, are incorporated as weak supervision to ground representations
in biologically meaningful interaction strengths. Experiments on four publicly
available datasets demonstrate that GRAMDTI consistently outperforms state of
the art baselines. Our results highlight the benefits of higher order
multimodal alignment, adaptive modality utilization, and auxiliary supervision
for robust and generalizable DTI prediction.

*Cheng Jin,Qitan Shi,Yuantao Gu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文分析了分类器自由引导(CFG)在扩散模型中的采样动态，揭示了CFG在采样过程中分为三个阶段：方向偏移、模式分离和集中阶段，解释了为什么强引导会提高语义对齐但降低多样性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解CFG对扩散模型采样动态的影响，特别是对于多模态条件分布的情况，因为之前的研究通常局限于单模态条件分布或简化情况。

Method: 通过理论分析CFG在多模态条件下的采样过程，将采样过程分解为三个连续阶段，并通过实验验证理论预测。

Result: 发现CFG采样过程包含三个阶段：方向偏移阶段（加速向加权均值移动）、模式分离阶段（抑制较弱模式）和集中阶段（放大模式内收缩）。实验证实早期强引导会侵蚀全局多样性，而后期强引导会抑制细粒度变化。

Conclusion: 提出了时间变化的引导调度方法，实验证明这种方法能同时提高生成质量和多样性，为CFG的实际应用提供了理论指导。

Abstract: Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) is widely used to improve conditional fidelity
in diffusion models, but its impact on sampling dynamics remains poorly
understood. Prior studies, often restricted to unimodal conditional
distributions or simplified cases, provide only a partial picture. We analyze
CFG under multimodal conditionals and show that the sampling process unfolds in
three successive stages. In the Direction Shift stage, guidance accelerates
movement toward the weighted mean, introducing initialization bias and norm
growth. In the Mode Separation stage, local dynamics remain largely neutral,
but the inherited bias suppresses weaker modes, reducing global diversity. In
the Concentration stage, guidance amplifies within-mode contraction,
diminishing fine-grained variability. This unified view explains a widely
observed phenomenon: stronger guidance improves semantic alignment but
inevitably reduces diversity. Experiments support these predictions, showing
that early strong guidance erodes global diversity, while late strong guidance
suppresses fine-grained variation. Moreover, our theory naturally suggests a
time-varying guidance schedule, and empirical results confirm that it
consistently improves both quality and diversity.

TL;DR: 提出了一种结构化目标引导强化学习方法，通过LLM生成可重用的结构化目标函数和动作剪枝机制，提升强化学习在复杂环境中的探索效率和长期规划能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实决策任务环境复杂开放，传统强化学习方法存在探索效率低和长期规划能力不足的问题，而现有LLM增强方法依赖频繁调用且存在语义不匹配问题。

Method: 结合结构化目标规划器和目标条件动作剪枝器，前者利用LLM生成带优先级权重的可重用目标函数，后者使用动作掩码机制过滤与目标不一致的动作。

Result: 在Crafter和Craftax-Classic环境上的实验结果表明，该方法相比现有最优方法取得了更优越的性能。

Conclusion: SGRL方法通过结构化目标引导和动作剪枝机制，有效提升了强化学习在复杂环境中的探索效率和决策质量。

Abstract: Real-world decision-making tasks typically occur in complex and open
environments, posing significant challenges to reinforcement learning (RL)
agents' exploration efficiency and long-horizon planning capabilities. A
promising approach is LLM-enhanced RL, which leverages the rich prior knowledge
and strong planning capabilities of LLMs to guide RL agents in efficient
exploration. However, existing methods mostly rely on frequent and costly LLM
invocations and suffer from limited performance due to the semantic mismatch.
In this paper, we introduce a Structured Goal-guided Reinforcement Learning
(SGRL) method that integrates a structured goal planner and a goal-conditioned
action pruner to guide RL agents toward efficient exploration. Specifically,
the structured goal planner utilizes LLMs to generate a reusable, structured
function for goal generation, in which goals are prioritized. Furthermore, by
utilizing LLMs to determine goals' priority weights, it dynamically generates
forward-looking goals to guide the agent's policy toward more promising
decision-making trajectories. The goal-conditioned action pruner employs an
action masking mechanism that filters out actions misaligned with the current
goal, thereby constraining the RL agent to select goal-consistent policies. We
evaluate the proposed method on Crafter and Craftax-Classic, and experimental
results demonstrate that SGRL achieves superior performance compared to
existing state-of-the-art methods.

TL;DR: Concept-SAE是一个通过混合解缠策略创建语义基础概念令牌的框架，相比标准稀疏自编码器，它能实现更可靠的因果探测和模型行为分析。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准稀疏自编码器虽然能发现模型学习到的特征字典，但这些特征具有模糊性和无基础性，使其在主动、因果探测模型行为时不可靠。

Method: 采用双重监督的混合解缠策略，创建语义基础的概念令牌，通过直接干预和系统定位来探测内部概念与预测之间的因果联系以及模型的失败模式。

Result: 双重监督方法产生的令牌具有显著忠实性和空间局部性，在解缠方面优于其他方法，验证的保真度支持了因果链接探测和对抗性漏洞定位。

Conclusion: Concept-SAE提供了一个经过验证的蓝图，使模型解释从相关性转向机制性、因果性的探测。

Abstract: Standard Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) excel at discovering a dictionary of a
model's learned features, offering a powerful observational lens. However, the
ambiguous and ungrounded nature of these features makes them unreliable
instruments for the active, causal probing of model behavior. To solve this, we
introduce Concept-SAE, a framework that forges semantically grounded concept
tokens through a novel hybrid disentanglement strategy. We first quantitatively
demonstrate that our dual-supervision approach produces tokens that are
remarkably faithful and spatially localized, outperforming alternative methods
in disentanglement. This validated fidelity enables two critical applications:
(1) we probe the causal link between internal concepts and predictions via
direct intervention, and (2) we probe the model's failure modes by
systematically localizing adversarial vulnerabilities to specific layers.
Concept-SAE provides a validated blueprint for moving beyond correlational
interpretation to the mechanistic, causal probing of model behavior.

TL;DR: AEGIS框架通过重采样现有训练边来增强稀疏二分知识图谱，避免伪造端点，在稀疏图和数据稀疏场景下提升链接预测性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决小众领域二分知识图谱数据贫乏和边稀疏的问题，这些特性阻碍了链接预测的性能

Method: 提出AEGIS边缘增强框架，通过均匀重采样或逆度偏置重采样现有训练边，保持原始节点集，避免伪造端点。在自然稀疏图和人工稀疏化基准数据集上测试

Result: 在Amazon和MovieLens上，基于复制的AEGIS变体与基线相当，而语义KNN增强是唯一能恢复AUC和校准的方法。在GDP图上，语义KNN实现最大AUC提升和Brier分数降低

Conclusion: 真实性约束的重采样是稀疏二分链接预测的数据高效策略，当有信息丰富的节点描述时，语义增强能提供额外提升

Abstract: Bipartite knowledge graphs in niche domains are typically data-poor and
edge-sparse, which hinders link prediction. We introduce AEGIS (Authentic Edge
Growth In Sparsity), an edge-only augmentation framework that resamples
existing training edges -either uniformly simple or with inverse-degree bias
degree-aware -thereby preserving the original node set and sidestepping
fabricated endpoints. To probe authenticity across regimes, we consider
naturally sparse graphs (game design pattern's game-pattern network) and induce
sparsity in denser benchmarks (Amazon, MovieLens) via high-rate bond
percolation. We evaluate augmentations on two complementary metrics: AUC-ROC
(higher is better) and the Brier score (lower is better), using two-tailed
paired t-tests against sparse baselines. On Amazon and MovieLens, copy-based
AEGIS variants match the baseline while the semantic KNN augmentation is the
only method that restores AUC and calibration; random and synthetic edges
remain detrimental. On the text-rich GDP graph, semantic KNN achieves the
largest AUC improvement and Brier score reduction, and simple also lowers the
Brier score relative to the sparse control. These findings position
authenticity-constrained resampling as a data-efficient strategy for sparse
bipartite link prediction, with semantic augmentation providing an additional
boost when informative node descriptions are available.

TL;DR: WeatherPEFT是一个针对天气基础模型的高效微调框架，通过动态提示和自适应参数选择，在保持性能的同时大幅减少可训练参数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有参数高效微调方法无法处理天气下游任务的独特挑战，如变量异质性、分辨率多样性和时空覆盖变化，导致在天气基础模型上表现不佳。

Method: WeatherPEFT包含两个创新：前向传播中的任务自适应动态提示(TADP)通过内外模式提取动态注入嵌入权重；反向传播中的随机Fisher引导自适应选择(SFAS)利用Fisher信息识别关键参数并引入随机性稳定选择。

Result: 在三个下游任务上，WeatherPEFT使用更少的可训练参数实现了与全微调相当的性能，而现有PEFT方法相比全微调存在显著差距。

Conclusion: WeatherPEFT有效解决了天气基础模型高效微调的挑战，为实际部署提供了可行方案。

Abstract: While recent advances in machine learning have equipped Weather Foundation
Models (WFMs) with substantial generalization capabilities across diverse
downstream tasks, the escalating computational requirements associated with
their expanding scale increasingly hinder practical deployment. Current
Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods, designed for vision or language
tasks, fail to address the unique challenges of weather downstream tasks, such
as variable heterogeneity, resolution diversity, and spatiotemporal coverage
variations, leading to suboptimal performance when applied to WFMs. To bridge
this gap, we introduce WeatherPEFT, a novel PEFT framework for WFMs
incorporating two synergistic innovations. First, during the forward pass,
Task-Adaptive Dynamic Prompting (TADP) dynamically injects the embedding
weights within the encoder to the input tokens of the pre-trained backbone via
internal and external pattern extraction, enabling context-aware feature
recalibration for specific downstream tasks. Furthermore, during
backpropagation, Stochastic Fisher-Guided Adaptive Selection (SFAS) not only
leverages Fisher information to identify and update the most task-critical
parameters, thereby preserving invariant pre-trained knowledge, but also
introduces randomness to stabilize the selection. We demonstrate the
effectiveness and efficiency of WeatherPEFT on three downstream tasks, where
existing PEFT methods show significant gaps versus Full-Tuning, and WeatherPEFT
achieves performance parity with Full-Tuning using fewer trainable parameters.
The code of this work will be released.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在组合问题（如数独、可满足性问题等）上表现不佳，需要填补这一能力空白。

Method: 将数独规则的模仿学习与显式深度优先搜索策略相结合，包括有根据的猜测和回溯机制，使用标准的解码器Transformer模型。

Result: 在数独问题上实现了99%的准确率，达到了最先进的性能水平。

Conclusion: 该方法成功地将神经网络的模仿学习与经典搜索算法相结合，为解决NP类问题提供了新思路，并建立了与上下文变体Min-Sum Set Cover问题的理论联系。

Abstract: Despite their proficiency in various language tasks, Large Language Models
(LLMs) struggle with combinatorial problems like Satisfiability, Traveling
Salesman Problem, or even basic arithmetic. We address this gap through a novel
approach for solving problems in the class NP. We focus on the paradigmatic
task of Sudoku and achieve state-of-the-art accuracy (99\%) compared to prior
neuro-symbolic approaches. Unlike prior work that used custom architectures,
our method employs a vanilla decoder-only Transformer (GPT-2) without external
tools or function calling. Our method integrates imitation learning of simple
Sudoku rules with an explicit Depth-First Search (DFS) exploration strategy
involving informed guessing and backtracking. Moving beyond imitation learning,
we seek to minimize the number of guesses until reaching a solution. We provide
a rigorous analysis of this setup formalizing its connection to a contextual
variant of Min-Sum Set Cover, a well-studied problem in algorithms and
stochastic optimization.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MCGM是一个轻量级的即插即用模块，通过高效聚类操作为几何图神经网络提供分层全局上下文，解决了传统方法在建模长程相互作用时的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 几何图神经网络在捕捉分子几何方面表现出色，但其局部偏置的消息传递机制难以建模长程相互作用。现有解决方案存在根本性限制：扩展截断半径会导致计算成本随距离立方增长；物理启发核缺乏通用性；傅里叶空间方法需要精细调参且计算开销大。

Method: MCGM通过多阶段聚类全局建模，构建原子簇的多分辨率层次结构，通过动态分层聚类提取全局信息，并通过学习变换传播这些上下文，最终通过残差连接增强原子特征。

Result: 在四种不同骨干架构中无缝集成MCGM，将OE62能量预测误差平均降低26.2%。在AQM数据集上，MCGM实现了最先进的精度（能量17.0 meV，力4.9 meV/Å），同时比Neural P3M少使用20%的参数。

Conclusion: MCGM是一个有效的解决方案，能够为几何图神经网络提供分层全局上下文，显著提升长程相互作用建模能力，同时保持计算效率。

Abstract: Geometric graph neural networks (GNNs) excel at capturing molecular geometry,
yet their locality-biased message passing hampers the modeling of long-range
interactions. Current solutions have fundamental limitations: extending cutoff
radii causes computational costs to scale cubically with distance;
physics-inspired kernels (e.g., Coulomb, dispersion) are often system-specific
and lack generality; Fourier-space methods require careful tuning of multiple
parameters (e.g., mesh size, k-space cutoff) with added computational overhead.
We introduce Multi-stage Clustered Global Modeling (MCGM), a lightweight,
plug-and-play module that endows geometric GNNs with hierarchical global
context through efficient clustering operations. MCGM builds a multi-resolution
hierarchy of atomic clusters, distills global information via dynamic
hierarchical clustering, and propagates this context back through learned
transformations, ultimately reinforcing atomic features via residual
connections. Seamlessly integrated into four diverse backbone architectures,
MCGM reduces OE62 energy prediction error by an average of 26.2%. On AQM, MCGM
achieves state-of-the-art accuracy (17.0 meV for energy, 4.9 meV/{\AA} for
forces) while using 20% fewer parameters than Neural P3M. Code will be made
available upon acceptance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统稀疏自编码器存在特征吸收（专用特征捕获通用特征实例）和特征组合（独立特征合并为复合表示）的问题，需要改进特征表示质量。

Method: 引入新的训练过程，通过惩罚SAE特征间的高余弦相似度来强制特征正交性，该方法计算复杂度随SAE规模线性增长。

Result: OrtSAE在不同模型和层上的实验显示：发现9%更多独特特征，减少65%特征吸收和15%特征组合，在虚假相关性移除任务上性能提升6%，其他下游任务性能与传统SAE相当。

Conclusion: 正交约束有效缓解了SAE的特征吸收和组合问题，提升了特征解耦能力，且计算开销可控，是改进稀疏特征学习的有效方法。

Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) are a technique for sparse decomposition of neural
network activations into human-interpretable features. However, current SAEs
suffer from feature absorption, where specialized features capture instances of
general features creating representation holes, and feature composition, where
independent features merge into composite representations. In this work, we
introduce Orthogonal SAE (OrtSAE), a novel approach aimed to mitigate these
issues by enforcing orthogonality between the learned features. By implementing
a new training procedure that penalizes high pairwise cosine similarity between
SAE features, OrtSAE promotes the development of disentangled features while
scaling linearly with the SAE size, avoiding significant computational
overhead. We train OrtSAE across different models and layers and compare it
with other methods. We find that OrtSAE discovers 9% more distinct features,
reduces feature absorption (by 65%) and composition (by 15%), improves
performance on spurious correlation removal (+6%), and achieves on-par
performance for other downstream tasks compared to traditional SAEs.

Abstract: Latent space is one of the key concepts in generative AI, offering powerful
means for creative exploration through vector manipulation. However, diffusion
models like Stable Diffusion lack the intuitive latent vector control found in
GANs, limiting their flexibility for artistic expression. This paper introduces
\workname, a framework for integrating customizable latent space operations
into the diffusion process. By enabling direct manipulation of conceptual and
spatial representations, this approach expands creative possibilities in
generative art. We demonstrate the potential of this framework through two
artworks, \textit{Infinitepedia} and \textit{Latent Motion}, highlighting its
use in conceptual blending and dynamic motion generation. Our findings reveal
latent space structures with semantic and meaningless regions, offering
insights into the geometry of diffusion models and paving the way for further
explorations of latent space.

Conclusion: CDP提供了一种可验证的降维方法，能够保持局部非凸性，并通过评估协议使实践者能够在数据上检查保证。

Abstract: We propose Convexity-Driven Projection (CDP), a boundary-free linear method
for dimensionality reduction of point clouds that targets preserving
detour-induced local non-convexity. CDP builds a $k$-NN graph, identifies
admissible pairs whose Euclidean-to-shortest-path ratios are below a threshold,
and aggregates their normalized directions to form a positive semidefinite
non-convexity structure matrix. The projection uses the top-$k$ eigenvectors of
the structure matrix. We give two verifiable guarantees. A pairwise
a-posteriori certificate that bounds the post-projection distortion for each
admissible pair, and an average-case spectral bound that links expected
captured direction energy to the spectrum of the structure matrix, yielding
quantile statements for typical distortion. Our evaluation protocol reports
fixed- and reselected-pairs detour errors and certificate quantiles, enabling
practitioners to check guarantees on their data.

Motivation: 在真实任务中，高度可靠的奖励模型往往不可用。特别是在多目标设置中，GRPO容易优化其中一个目标而牺牲其他目标，即奖励黑客问题。

Method: 提出MO-GRPO，使用归一化方法根据奖励函数值的方差自动重新加权奖励函数，确保所有奖励函数对损失函数的贡献均匀，同时保持偏好顺序。

Conclusion: MO-GRPO是多目标强化学习问题中一个有前景的算法，能够稳定学习并避免奖励黑客问题。

Abstract: Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) has been shown to be an effective
algorithm when an accurate reward model is available. However, such a highly
reliable reward model is not available in many real-world tasks. In this paper,
we particularly focus on multi-objective settings, in which we identify that
GRPO is vulnerable to reward hacking, optimizing only one of the objectives at
the cost of the others. To address this issue, we propose MO-GRPO, an extension
of GRPO with a simple normalization method to reweight the reward functions
automatically according to the variances of their values. We first show
analytically that MO-GRPO ensures that all reward functions contribute evenly
to the loss function while preserving the order of preferences, eliminating the
need for manual tuning of the reward functions' scales. Then, we evaluate
MO-GRPO experimentally in four domains: (i) the multi-armed bandits problem,
(ii) simulated control task (Mo-Gymnasium), (iii) machine translation tasks on
the WMT benchmark (En-Ja, En-Zh), and (iv) instruction following task. MO-GRPO
achieves stable learning by evenly distributing correlations among the
components of rewards, outperforming GRPO, showing MO-GRPO to be a promising
algorithm for multi-objective reinforcement learning problems.

Conclusion: BrainPro通过创新的空间学习和状态解耦设计，能够无缝适应多样化任务和硬件设置，为EEG分析提供了更有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) is a non-invasive technique for recording brain
electrical activity, widely used in brain-computer interface (BCI) and
healthcare. Recent EEG foundation models trained on large-scale datasets have
shown improved performance and generalizability over traditional decoding
methods, yet significant challenges remain. Existing models often fail to
explicitly capture channel-to-channel and region-to-region interactions, which
are critical sources of information inherently encoded in EEG signals. Due to
varying channel configurations across datasets, they either approximate spatial
structure with self-attention or restrict training to a limited set of common
channels, sacrificing flexibility and effectiveness. Moreover, although EEG
datasets reflect diverse brain states such as emotion, motor, and others,
current models rarely learn state-aware representations during self-supervised
pre-training. To address these gaps, we propose BrainPro, a large EEG model
that introduces a retrieval-based spatial learning block to flexibly capture
channel- and region-level interactions across varying electrode layouts, and a
brain state-decoupling block that enables state-aware representation learning
through parallel encoders with decoupling and region-aware reconstruction
losses. This design allows BrainPro to adapt seamlessly to diverse tasks and
hardware settings. Pre-trained on an extensive EEG corpus, BrainPro achieves
state-of-the-art performance and robust generalization across nine public BCI
datasets. Our codes and the pre-trained weights will be released.

originates from the multi-view structure present in the data. Feature
variations within samples of the same class allow the student model to
generalize better by learning diverse representations. However, in existing
distillation methods, teacher models predominantly adhere to ground-truth
labels as targets, without considering the diverse representations within the
same class. Therefore, we propose incorporating an intra-class contrastive loss
during teacher training to enrich the intra-class information contained in soft
labels. In practice, we find that intra-class loss causes instability in
training and slows convergence. To mitigate these issues, margin loss is
integrated into intra-class contrastive learning to improve the training
stability and convergence speed. Simultaneously, we theoretically analyze the
impact of this loss on the intra-class distances and inter-class distances. It
has been proved that the intra-class contrastive loss can enrich the
intra-class diversity. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of
the proposed method.

Abstract: Parameter transfer is a central paradigm in transfer learning, enabling
knowledge reuse across tasks and domains by sharing model parameters between
upstream and downstream models. However, when only a subset of parameters from
the upstream model is transferred to the downstream model, there remains a lack
of theoretical understanding of the conditions under which such partial
parameter reuse is beneficial and of the factors that govern its effectiveness.
To address this gap, we analyze a setting in which both the upstream and
downstream models are ReLU convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Within this
theoretical framework, we characterize how the inherited parameters act as
carriers of universal knowledge and identify key factors that amplify their
beneficial impact on the target task. Furthermore, our analysis provides
insight into why, in certain cases, transferring parameters can lead to lower
test accuracy on the target task than training a new model from scratch.
Numerical experiments and real-world data experiments are conducted to
empirically validate our theoretical findings.

TL;DR: 激活引导技术通过向LLM隐藏状态添加语义向量来控制模型行为，但研究发现这会系统性破坏模型的安全防护，使模型更容易响应有害请求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 验证激活引导技术是否真的能提供比微调更精确、可解释和安全的模型控制方法。

Method: 在不同模型系列上进行广泛实验，包括随机方向引导、使用稀疏自编码器提取的良性特征引导，以及组合多个随机向量创建通用攻击。

Result: 随机方向引导可将有害请求的响应概率从0%提升到2-27%；使用SAE良性特征引导进一步增加2-4%；组合20个随机向量可创建通用攻击，显著提高对未见请求的有害响应率。

Conclusion: 精确控制模型内部状态并不能保证精确控制模型行为，这挑战了"通过可解释性实现安全"的范式。

Abstract: Activation steering is a promising technique for controlling LLM behavior by
adding semantically meaningful vectors directly into a model's hidden states
during inference. It is often framed as a precise, interpretable, and
potentially safer alternative to fine-tuning. We demonstrate the opposite:
steering systematically breaks model alignment safeguards, making it comply
with harmful requests. Through extensive experiments on different model
families, we show that even steering in a random direction can increase the
probability of harmful compliance from 0% to 2-27%. Alarmingly, steering benign
features from a sparse autoencoder (SAE), a common source of interpretable
directions, increases these rates by a further 2-4%. Finally, we show that
combining 20 randomly sampled vectors that jailbreak a single prompt creates a
universal attack, significantly increasing harmful compliance on unseen
requests. These results challenge the paradigm of safety through
interpretability, showing that precise control over model internals does not
guarantee precise control over model behavior.

TL;DR: 本文提出NL-SME方法，首次引入非线性参数轨迹建模来改进联邦学习中的梯度反演攻击，通过可学习的二次贝塞尔曲线捕捉SGD的非线性特征，显著提升了攻击效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦学习通过保持原始数据本地化来保护隐私，但梯度反演攻击构成严重威胁。现有的代理模型方法假设线性参数轨迹，严重低估了SGD的非线性复杂性，限制了攻击有效性。

Method: 提出非线性代理模型扩展(NL-SME)，用可学习的二次贝塞尔曲线替代线性插值，通过控制点捕捉SGD的曲线特征，结合正则化和dvec缩放机制增强表达能力。

Result: 在CIFAR-100和FEMNIST数据集上的实验表明，NL-SME在所有指标上显著优于基线方法，余弦相似度损失实现了数量级改进，同时保持计算效率。

Conclusion: 这项工作揭示了联邦学习多步更新范式中的隐私脆弱性，并为开发鲁棒防御策略提供了新视角。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) preserves privacy by keeping raw data local, yet
Gradient Inversion Attacks (GIAs) pose significant threats. In FedAVG
multi-step scenarios, attackers observe only aggregated gradients, making data
reconstruction challenging. Existing surrogate model methods like SME assume
linear parameter trajectories, but we demonstrate this severely underestimates
SGD's nonlinear complexity, fundamentally limiting attack effectiveness. We
propose Non-Linear Surrogate Model Extension (NL-SME), the first method to
introduce nonlinear parametric trajectory modeling for GIAs. Our approach
replaces linear interpolation with learnable quadratic B\'ezier curves that
capture SGD's curved characteristics through control points, combined with
regularization and dvec scaling mechanisms for enhanced expressiveness.
Extensive experiments on CIFAR-100 and FEMNIST datasets show NL-SME
significantly outperforms baselines across all metrics, achieving
order-of-magnitude improvements in cosine similarity loss while maintaining
computational efficiency.This work exposes heightened privacy vulnerabilities
in FL's multi-step update paradigm and offers novel perspectives for developing
robust defense strategies.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved remarkable success across a range

challenge, especially for graph-level tasks. In this work, we introduce
SHAKE-GNN, a novel scalable graph-level GNN framework based on a hierarchy of
Kirchhoff Forests, a class of random spanning forests used to construct
stochastic multi-resolution decompositions of graphs. SHAKE-GNN produces
multi-scale representations, enabling flexible trade-offs between efficiency

Conclusion: 研究强调了将时间和行为动态纳入实用追索系统设计的重要性，确保建议在预定义时间范围内保持有效

Abstract: Algorithmic recourse seeks to provide individuals with actionable
recommendations that increase their chances of receiving favorable outcomes
from automated decision systems (e.g., loan approvals). While prior research
has emphasized robustness to model updates, considerably less attention has
been given to the temporal dynamics of recourse--particularly in competitive,
resource-constrained settings where recommendations shape future applicant
pools. In this work, we present a novel time-aware framework for algorithmic
recourse, explicitly modeling how candidate populations adapt in response to
recommendations. Additionally, we introduce a novel reinforcement learning
(RL)-based recourse algorithm that captures the evolving dynamics of the
environment to generate recommendations that are both feasible and valid. We
design our recommendations to be durable, supporting validity over a predefined
time horizon T. This durability allows individuals to confidently reapply after
taking time to implement the suggested changes. Through extensive experiments
in complex simulation environments, we show that our approach substantially
outperforms existing baselines, offering a superior balance between feasibility
and long-term validity. Together, these results underscore the importance of
incorporating temporal and behavioral dynamics into the design of practical
recourse systems.

Abstract: Psychological attributes rarely operate in isolation: coaches reason about
networks of related traits. We analyze a new dataset of 164 female volleyball
players from Italy's C and D leagues that combines standardized psychological
profiling with background information. To learn directed relationships among
mixed-type variables (ordinal questionnaire scores, categorical demographics,
continuous indicators), we introduce latent MMHC, a hybrid structure learner
that couples a latent Gaussian copula and a constraint-based skeleton with a
constrained score-based refinement to return a single DAG. We also study a
bootstrap-aggregated variant for stability. In simulations spanning sample
size, sparsity, and dimension, latent Max-Min Hill-Climbing (MMHC) attains
lower structural Hamming distance and higher edge recall than recent
copula-based learners while maintaining high specificity. Applied to
volleyball, the learned network organizes mental skills around goal setting and
self-confidence, with emotional arousal linking motivation and anxiety, and
locates Big-Five traits (notably neuroticism and extraversion) upstream of
skill clusters. Scenario analyses quantify how improvements in specific skills
propagate through the network to shift preparation, confidence, and
self-esteem. The approach provides an interpretable, data-driven framework for
profiling psychological traits in sport and for decision support in athlete
development.

Motivation: 对抗性机器学习挑战了训练和实现预测模型时基础分布保持一致的假设。在回归场景中，现有的悲观双层优化方法尚未适应，需要开发不依赖对手策略凸性和唯一性假设的防御方法。

Method: 提出了一种用于回归场景的悲观双层优化程序，该方法移除了关于对手最优策略凸性和唯一性的假设，能够捕捉对手的对抗性质。

Result: 该方法能够有效建模对抗性规避场景，训练出对恶意数据具有弹性的预测器。

Conclusion: 所提出的悲观双层优化程序为回归场景中的对抗性威胁提供了有效的缓解方案，扩展了对抗性机器学习在回归问题中的应用。

Abstract: Adversarial machine learning challenges the assumption that the underlying
distribution remains consistent throughout the training and implementation of a
prediction model. In particular, adversarial evasion considers scenarios where
adversaries adapt their data to influence particular outcomes from established
prediction models, such scenarios arise in applications such as spam email
filtering, malware detection and fake-image generation, where security methods
must be actively updated to keep up with the ever-improving generation of
malicious data. Game theoretic models have been shown to be effective at
modelling these scenarios and hence training resilient predictors against such
adversaries. Recent advancements in the use of pessimistic bilevel optimsiation
which remove assumptions about the convexity and uniqueness of the adversary's
optimal strategy have proved to be particularly effective at mitigating threats
to classifiers due to its ability to capture the antagonistic nature of the
adversary. However, this formulation has not yet been adapted to regression
scenarios. This article serves to propose a pessimistic bilevel optimisation
program for regression scenarios which makes no assumptions on the convexity or
uniqueness of the adversary's solutions.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出D³S框架，通过动态双级下采样优化策略学习效率，在样本级选择优势方差最大的rollouts，在token级选择优势幅度与策略熵乘积高的tokens，结合动态下采样调度提升收敛速度和泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决无critic方法如GRPO收敛慢的问题，这些方法因大量无信息样本和token稀释了关键学习信号。

Method: D³S框架包含样本级和token级两个层面的下采样：样本级最大化优势方差，token级选择|A|×H高的token；采用动态下采样调度，从激进下采样逐渐过渡到宽松采样。

Result: 在Qwen2.5和Llama3.1上的实验表明，D³S集成到先进RL算法中实现了SOTA性能和泛化能力，同时需要更少的样本和token。

Conclusion: D³S框架通过动态双级下采样有效提升了策略优化的效率和效果，在推理基准测试中表现出色。

Abstract: Critic-free methods like GRPO reduce memory demands by estimating advantages
from multiple rollouts but tend to converge slowly, as critical learning
signals are diluted by an abundance of uninformative samples and tokens. To
tackle this challenge, we propose the \textbf{Dynamic Dual-Level Down-Sampling
(D$^3$S)} framework that prioritizes the most informative samples and tokens
across groups to improve the efficient of policy optimization. D$^3$S operates
along two levels: (1) the sample-level, which selects a subset of rollouts to
maximize advantage variance ($\text{Var}(A)$). We theoretically proven that
this selection is positively correlated with the upper bound of the policy
gradient norms, yielding higher policy gradients. (2) the token-level, which
prioritizes tokens with a high product of advantage magnitude and policy
entropy ($|A_{i,t}|\times H_{i,t}$), focusing updates on tokens where the
policy is both uncertain and impactful. Moreover, to prevent overfitting to
high-signal data, D$^3$S employs a dynamic down-sampling schedule inspired by
curriculum learning. This schedule starts with aggressive down-sampling to
accelerate early learning and gradually relaxes to promote robust
generalization. Extensive experiments on Qwen2.5 and Llama3.1 demonstrate that
integrating D$^3$S into advanced RL algorithms achieves state-of-the-art
performance and generalization while requiring \textit{fewer} samples and
tokens across diverse reasoning benchmarks. Our code is added in the
supplementary materials and will be made publicly available.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: VITAL是一个基于大语言模型的框架，专门用于处理电子健康记录中不规则采样的生理时间序列数据，通过区分生命体征和实验室测试两种变量类型，分别采用不同的编码策略来处理缺失值问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 电子健康记录中的时间序列数据存在不规则采样和高缺失率的问题，临床变量根据工作流程和干预时间以不均匀间隔测量，这给建模带来了挑战。

Method: VITAL框架区分生命体征和实验室测试两种变量类型：生命体征被重新编程到语言空间，使LLM能够捕获时间上下文并通过显式编码推理缺失值；实验室变量则使用代表性汇总值或可学习的[未测量]标记进行嵌入。

Result: 在PhysioNet基准数据集上的广泛评估表明，VITAL优于为不规则时间序列设计的最先进方法，并在高缺失率情况下保持稳健性能。

Conclusion: VITAL能够有效处理真实世界临床场景中常见的高缺失率问题，为不规则采样的生理时间序列建模提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Irregular sampling and high missingness are intrinsic challenges in modeling
time series derived from electronic health records (EHRs),where clinical
variables are measured at uneven intervals depending on workflow and
intervention timing. To address this, we propose VITAL, a variable-aware, large
language model (LLM) based framework tailored for learning from irregularly
sampled physiological time series. VITAL differentiates between two distinct
types of clinical variables: vital signs, which are frequently recorded and
exhibit temporal patterns, and laboratory tests, which are measured
sporadically and lack temporal structure. It reprograms vital signs into the
language space, enabling the LLM to capture temporal context and reason over
missing values through explicit encoding. In contrast, laboratory variables are
embedded either using representative summary values or a learnable [Not
measured] token, depending on their availability. Extensive evaluations on the
benchmark datasets from the PhysioNet demonstrate that VITAL outperforms state
of the art methods designed for irregular time series. Furthermore, it
maintains robust performance under high levels of missingness, which is
prevalent in real world clinical scenarios where key variables are often
unavailable.

TL;DR: 提出了一种双切片Wasserstein（DSW）距离，作为Wasserstein over Wasserstein（WoW）距离的稳定且可扩展的替代方案，避免了高阶矩的不稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的切片WoW加速方法依赖于参数化元测度或高阶矩的存在，导致数值不稳定。需要一种更稳定的方法来比较数据集或图像和形状的分布。

Method: 利用1维Wasserstein空间与函数空间L2([0,1])中分位数函数的等距性，引入任意Banach空间的通用切片Wasserstein框架，通过高斯过程参数化的无限维L2投影定义1维元测度的切片距离。

Result: DSW最小化对于离散化元测度等价于WoW最小化，同时避免了不稳定的高阶矩并实现了计算节省。在数据集、形状和图像上的数值实验验证了DSW作为WoW距离的可扩展替代方案。

Conclusion: DSW提供了一个稳定且计算效率高的WoW距离替代方案，适用于比较元测度，在保持理论等价性的同时解决了现有方法的数值不稳定性问题。

Abstract: Wasserstein distances define a metric between probability measures on
arbitrary metric spaces, including meta-measures (measures over measures). The
resulting Wasserstein over Wasserstein (WoW) distance is a powerful, but
computationally costly tool for comparing datasets or distributions over images
and shapes. Existing sliced WoW accelerations rely on parametric meta-measures
or the existence of high-order moments, leading to numerical instability. As an
alternative, we propose to leverage the isometry between the 1d Wasserstein
space and the quantile functions in the function space $L_2([0,1])$. For this
purpose, we introduce a general sliced Wasserstein framework for arbitrary
Banach spaces. Due to the 1d Wasserstein isometry, this framework defines a
sliced distance between 1d meta-measures via infinite-dimensional
$L_2$-projections, parametrized by Gaussian processes. Combining this 1d
construction with classical integration over the Euclidean unit sphere yields
the double-sliced Wasserstein (DSW) metric for general meta-measures. We show
that DSW minimization is equivalent to WoW minimization for discretized
meta-measures, while avoiding unstable higher-order moments and computational
savings. Numerical experiments on datasets, shapes, and images validate DSW as
a scalable substitute for the WoW distance.

Conclusion: 所提出的正则化方法能够同时解决向量量化平滑中的两个关键问题，提供了一种简单有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Vector quantization, which discretizes a continuous vector space into a
finite set of representative vectors (a codebook), has been widely adopted in
modern machine learning. Despite its effectiveness, vector quantization poses a
fundamental challenge: the non-differentiable quantization step blocks gradient
backpropagation. Smoothed vector quantization addresses this issue by relaxing
the hard assignment of a codebook vector into a weighted combination of
codebook entries, represented as the matrix product of a simplex vector and the
codebook. Effective smoothing requires two properties: (1) smoothed quantizers
should remain close to a onehot vector, ensuring tight approximation, and (2)
all codebook entries should be utilized, preventing code collapse. Existing
methods typically address these desiderata separately. By contrast, the present
study introduces a simple and intuitive regularization that promotes both
simultaneously by minimizing the distance between each simplex vertex and its
$K$-nearest smoothed quantizers. Experiments on representative benchmarks,
including discrete image autoencoding and contrastive speech representation
learning, demonstrate that the proposed method achieves more reliable codebook
utilization and improves performance compared to prior approaches.

TL;DR: 本文系统分析了LLM中后训练N:M激活剪枝方法，发现激活剪枝比权重剪枝在相同稀疏度下能更好地保持生成能力，并推荐8:16稀疏模式作为硬件友好的最佳选择。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管半结构化(N:M)剪枝在权重剪枝中已广泛应用，但在激活剪枝领域仍未被充分探索，而激活剪枝具有动态、输入自适应的压缩潜力，并能减少I/O开销。

Method: 评估了轻量级即插即用的误差缓解技术和剪枝标准，建立了硬件友好的基线方法，仅需最小校准。探索了超越NVIDIA标准2:4的稀疏模式，包括16:32和8:16模式。

Result: 激活剪枝在多个LLM上相比权重剪枝在相同稀疏度下能更好地保持生成能力。16:32模式性能接近非结构化稀疏，但考虑到灵活性与硬件实现复杂度的权衡，8:16模式被确定为更优选择。

Conclusion: 研究为激活剪枝提供了有效的实用方法，并为未来硬件支持更灵活稀疏模式提供了动机。8:16稀疏模式在性能与硬件友好性之间取得了最佳平衡。

Abstract: The demand for efficient large language model (LLM) inference has intensified
the focus on sparsification techniques. While semi-structured (N:M) pruning is
well-established for weights, its application to activation pruning remains
underexplored despite its potential for dynamic, input-adaptive compression and
reductions in I/O overhead. This work presents a comprehensive analysis of
methods for post-training N:M activation pruning in LLMs. Across multiple LLMs,
we demonstrate that pruning activations enables superior preservation of
generative capabilities compared to weight pruning at equivalent sparsity
levels. We evaluate lightweight, plug-and-play error mitigation techniques and
pruning criteria, establishing strong hardware-friendly baselines that require
minimal calibration. Furthermore, we explore sparsity patterns beyond NVIDIA's
standard 2:4, showing that the 16:32 pattern achieves performance nearly on par
with unstructured sparsity. However, considering the trade-off between
flexibility and hardware implementation complexity, we focus on the 8:16
pattern as a superior candidate. Our findings provide both effective practical
methods for activation pruning and a motivation for future hardware to support
more flexible sparsity patterns. Our code is available

TL;DR: DYNAWEIGHT是一种新颖的分布式学习框架，通过动态分配邻居服务器权重来加速去中心化学习，特别适用于数据异构场景。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在完全去中心化基础设施中，由于缺乏集中聚合，本地处理变得至关重要。传统静态权重分配方法无法有效处理数据异构问题。

Method: DYNAWEIGHT根据邻居服务器在本地数据集上的相对损失动态分配权重，优先选择具有多样化信息的服务器。

Result: 在MNIST、CIFAR10和CIFAR100数据集上的实验表明，DYNAWEIGHT显著提高了训练速度，且通信和内存开销最小。

Conclusion: DYNAWEIGHT作为一种通用的聚合方案，可与任何底层服务器级优化算法兼容，具有广泛的集成潜力。

Abstract: In today's data-sensitive landscape, distributed learning emerges as a vital
tool, not only fortifying privacy measures but also streamlining computational
operations. This becomes especially crucial within fully decentralized
infrastructures where local processing is imperative due to the absence of
centralized aggregation. Here, we introduce DYNAWEIGHT, a novel framework to
information aggregation in multi-agent networks. DYNAWEIGHT offers substantial
acceleration in decentralized learning with minimal additional communication
and memory overhead. Unlike traditional static weight assignments, such as
Metropolis weights, DYNAWEIGHT dynamically allocates weights to neighboring
servers based on their relative losses on local datasets. Consequently, it
favors servers possessing diverse information, particularly in scenarios of
substantial data heterogeneity. Our experiments on various datasets MNIST,
CIFAR10, and CIFAR100 incorporating various server counts and graph topologies,
demonstrate notable enhancements in training speeds. Notably, DYNAWEIGHT
functions as an aggregation scheme compatible with any underlying server-level
optimization algorithm, underscoring its versatility and potential for
widespread integration.

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效从数据中发现对称群结构，构建简化的等变神经网络，在保持群对称性的同时提高学习效率。

Abstract: In this study, we introduce a method for learning group (known or unknown)
equivariant functions by learning the associated quadratic form $x^T A x$
corresponding to the group from the data. Certain groups, known as orthogonal
groups, preserve a specific quadratic form, and we leverage this property to
uncover the underlying symmetry group under the assumption that it is
orthogonal. By utilizing the corresponding unique symmetric matrix and its
inherent diagonal form, we incorporate suitable inductive biases into the
neural network architecture, leading to models that are both simplified and
efficient. Our approach results in an invariant model that preserves norms,
while the equivariant model is represented as a product of a norm-invariant
model and a scale-invariant model, where the ``product'' refers to the group
action.
  Moreover, we extend our framework to a more general setting where the
function acts on tuples of input vectors via a diagonal (or product) group
action. In this extension, the equivariant function is decomposed into an
angular component extracted solely from the normalized first vector and a
scale-invariant component that depends on the full Gram matrix of the tuple.
This decomposition captures the inter-dependencies between multiple inputs
while preserving the underlying group symmetry.
  We assess the effectiveness of our framework across multiple tasks, including
polynomial regression, top quark tagging, and moment of inertia matrix
prediction. Comparative analysis with baseline methods demonstrates that our
model consistently excels in both discovering the underlying symmetry and
efficiently learning the corresponding equivariant function.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一个基于机制独立性的统一框架来实现解耦表示，该框架通过潜在因子如何作用于观测变量而非其潜在分布来表征解耦，即使在非线性、非可逆混合下也能识别潜在子空间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解耦表示旨在恢复观测数据背后的潜在变化因子，但其可识别性尚未完全理解。现有方法通常依赖统计独立性假设，而本文探索在不依赖统计假设的条件下实现解耦表示。

Method: 引入机制独立性框架，提出从支撑集、稀疏性到高阶条件的多种相关独立性准则，并通过图论将潜在子空间表征为连通分量。

Result: 证明了每种准则都能在非线性、非可逆混合下实现潜在子空间的可识别性，并建立了这些准则之间的层次关系。

Conclusion: 该框架阐明了在不依赖统计假设的条件下解耦表示可被识别的条件，为解耦表示理论提供了新的视角。

Abstract: Disentangled representations seek to recover latent factors of variation
underlying observed data, yet their identifiability is still not fully
understood. We introduce a unified framework in which disentanglement is
achieved through mechanistic independence, which characterizes latent factors
by how they act on observed variables rather than by their latent distribution.
This perspective is invariant to changes of the latent density, even when such
changes induce statistical dependencies among factors. Within this framework,
we propose several related independence criteria -- ranging from support-based
and sparsity-based to higher-order conditions -- and show that each yields
identifiability of latent subspaces, even under nonlinear, non-invertible
mixing. We further establish a hierarchy among these criteria and provide a
graph-theoretic characterization of latent subspaces as connected components.
Together, these results clarify the conditions under which disentangled
representations can be identified without relying on statistical assumptions.

Motivation: 解决多维数据插补问题，特别是动态图流中缺失值的估计，需要既灵活又参数高效的方法

Conclusion: KReTTaH为多维数据插补提供了一个灵活且参数高效的框架，特别适用于包含图结构先验的动态图流估计问题

Abstract: A regression-based framework for interpretable multi-way data imputation,
termed Kernel Regression via Tensor Trains with Hadamard overparametrization
(KReTTaH), is introduced. KReTTaH adopts a nonparametric formulation by casting
imputation as regression via reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces. Parameter
efficiency is achieved through tensors of fixed tensor-train (TT) rank, which
reside on low-dimensional Riemannian manifolds, and is further enhanced via
Hadamard overparametrization, which promotes sparsity within the TT parameter
space. Learning is accomplished by solving a smooth inverse problem posed on
the Riemannian manifold of fixed TT-rank tensors. As a representative
application, the estimation of dynamic graph flows is considered. In this
setting, KReTTaH exhibits flexibility by seamlessly incorporating graph-based
(topological) priors via its inverse problem formulation. Numerical tests on
real-world graph datasets demonstrate that KReTTaH consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art alternatives-including a nonparametric tensor- and a
neural-network-based methods-for imputing missing, time-varying edge flows.

Method: 基于残差可逆消息传递的数学可逆设计，使用共享参数耦合正向动力学与逆向推理，不试图反转底层物理过程。

Result: 在三个耗散基准测试中，R-GNS仅用四分之一参数达到更高精度和一致性，逆向推理速度比优化基准快100倍以上，在目标条件任务中消除迭代优化实现数量级加速。

Conclusion: R-GNS是首个统一耗散流体系统正向和逆向模拟的可逆框架，能够生成复杂目标形状的物理一致轨迹。

Abstract: Simulating physically plausible trajectories toward user-defined goals is a
fundamental yet challenging task in fluid dynamics. While particle-based
simulators can efficiently reproduce forward dynamics, inverse inference
remains difficult, especially in dissipative systems where dynamics are
irreversible and optimization-based solvers are slow, unstable, and often fail
to converge. In this work, we introduce the Reversible Graph Network Simulator
(R-GNS), a unified framework that enforces bidirectional consistency within a
single graph architecture. Unlike prior neural simulators that approximate
inverse dynamics by fitting backward data, R-GNS does not attempt to reverse
the underlying physics. Instead, we propose a mathematically invertible design
based on residual reversible message passing with shared parameters, coupling
forward dynamics with inverse inference to deliver accurate predictions and
efficient recovery of plausible initial states. Experiments on three
dissipative benchmarks (Water-3D, WaterRamps, and WaterDrop) show that R-GNS
achieves higher accuracy and consistency with only one quarter of the
parameters, and performs inverse inference more than 100 times faster than
optimization-based baselines. For forward simulation, R-GNS matches the speed
of strong GNS baselines, while in goal-conditioned tasks it eliminates
iterative optimization and achieves orders-of-magnitude speedups. On
goal-conditioned tasks, R-GNS further demonstrates its ability to complex
target shapes (e.g., characters "L" and "N") through vivid, physically
consistent trajectories. To our knowledge, this is the first reversible
framework that unifies forward and inverse simulation for dissipative fluid
systems.

Motivation: 研究大规模深度学习模型的数据记忆现象，从数据重建角度分析模型参数何时能够泄露训练数据隐私。

Method: 在随机特征模型中分析特征空间训练样本子空间的信息量，提出基于优化的数据重建方法，并在多种架构上验证。

Result: 当p > dn时，可以从模型参数中成功重建训练数据集，在随机特征、全连接和残差网络等架构上都表现良好。

Conclusion: 揭示了数据重建的基本规律：当模型参数数量超过阈值dn时，整个训练数据集都可以从模型中被重建出来。

Abstract: Large-scale deep learning models are known to memorize parts of the training
set. In machine learning theory, memorization is often framed as interpolation
or label fitting, and classical results show that this can be achieved when the
number of parameters $p$ in the model is larger than the number of training
samples $n$. In this work, we consider memorization from the perspective of
data reconstruction, demonstrating that this can be achieved when $p$ is larger
than $dn$, where $d$ is the dimensionality of the data. More specifically, we
show that, in the random features model, when $p \gg dn$, the subspace spanned
by the training samples in feature space gives sufficient information to
identify the individual samples in input space. Our analysis suggests an
optimization method to reconstruct the dataset from the model parameters, and
we demonstrate that this method performs well on various architectures (random
features, two-layer fully-connected and deep residual networks). Our results
reveal a law of data reconstruction, according to which the entire training
dataset can be recovered as $p$ exceeds the threshold $dn$.

Motivation: SO(n)的单参数子群在机器人学、量子力学和分子结构分析等应用中至关重要，需要自动发现这些子群的方法。

Method: 利用斜对称矩阵的标准Jordan形式建立轨道规范形式，通过参数学习揭示底层单参数子群Hγ，推导Hγ不变函数的标准化表示。

Result: 在双摆建模、转动惯量预测、顶夸克标记和不变多项式回归等任务中成功恢复了有意义的子群结构，并产生了可解释的对称感知表示。

Conclusion: 该框架能够有效发现SO(n)的单参数子群，在多个应用中表现出色，为对称性感知的表示学习提供了新方法。

Abstract: We introduce a novel framework for the automatic discovery of one-parameter
subgroups ($H_{\gamma}$) of $SO(3)$ and, more generally, $SO(n)$. One-parameter
subgroups of $SO(n)$ are crucial in a wide range of applications, including
robotics, quantum mechanics, and molecular structure analysis. Our method
utilizes the standard Jordan form of skew-symmetric matrices, which define the
Lie algebra of $SO(n)$, to establish a canonical form for orbits under the
action of $H_{\gamma}$. This canonical form is then employed to derive a
standardized representation for $H_{\gamma}$-invariant functions. By learning
the appropriate parameters, the framework uncovers the underlying one-parameter
subgroup $H_{\gamma}$. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is
demonstrated through tasks such as double pendulum modeling, moment of inertia
prediction, top quark tagging and invariant polynomial regression, where it
successfully recovers meaningful subgroup structure and produces interpretable,
symmetry-aware representations.

Result: 在招聘和欺诈检测两个场景中，该框架学习到的策略在多个场景下更加公平，仅带来轻微的性能损失，同时发现群体公平和个体公平并不必然相互蕴含。

Conclusion: 该框架能够有效处理顺序决策中的公平性问题，为利益相关者提供可获得的性能-公平权衡指导，并给出了在不同问题设置中应用该框架的指南。

Abstract: Equity in real-world sequential decision problems can be enforced using
fairness-aware methods. Therefore, we require algorithms that can make suitable
and transparent trade-offs between performance and the desired fairness
notions. As the desired performance-fairness trade-off is hard to specify a
priori, we propose a framework where multiple trade-offs can be explored.
Insights provided by the reinforcement learning algorithm regarding the
obtainable performance-fairness trade-offs can then guide stakeholders in
selecting the most appropriate policy. To capture fairness, we propose an
extended Markov decision process, $f$MDP, that explicitly encodes individuals
and groups. Given this $f$MDP, we formalise fairness notions in the context of
sequential decision problems and formulate a fairness framework that computes
fairness measures over time. We evaluate our framework in two scenarios with
distinct fairness requirements: job hiring, where strong teams must be composed
while treating applicants equally, and fraud detection, where fraudulent
transactions must be detected while ensuring the burden on customers is fairly
distributed. We show that our framework learns policies that are more fair
across multiple scenarios, with only minor loss in performance reward.
Moreover, we observe that group and individual fairness notions do not
necessarily imply one another, highlighting the benefit of our framework in
settings where both fairness types are desired. Finally, we provide guidelines
on how to apply this framework across different problem settings.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的形式化语句相似度评估方法无法平衡语义和结构信息，字符串方法忽略语义，证明方法缺乏分级相似度评分。

Result: 在EPLA基准测试中，TransTED相似度方法达到最先进准确率和最高Kappa系数。

Conclusion: ASSESS框架有效整合语义和结构信息，为形式化语句相似度评估提供了连续评分，在EPLA基准上表现优异。

Abstract: Statement autoformalization, the automated translation of statements from
natural language into formal languages, has seen significant advancements, yet
the development of automated evaluation metrics remains limited. Existing
metrics for formal statement similarity often fail to balance semantic and
structural information. String-based approaches capture syntactic structure but
ignore semantic meaning, whereas proof-based methods validate semantic
equivalence but disregard structural nuances and, critically, provide no graded
similarity score in the event of proof failure. To address these issues, we
introduce ASSESS (A Semantic and Structural Evaluation Framework for Statement
Similarity), which comprehensively integrates semantic and structural
information to provide a continuous similarity score. Our framework first
transforms formal statements into Operator Trees to capture their syntactic
structure and then computes a similarity score using our novel TransTED
(Transformation Tree Edit Distance) Similarity metric, which enhances
traditional Tree Edit Distance by incorporating semantic awareness through
transformations. For rigorous validation, we present EPLA (Evaluating
Provability and Likeness for Autoformalization), a new benchmark of 524
expert-annotated formal statement pairs derived from miniF2F and ProofNet, with
labels for both semantic provability and structural likeness. Experiments on
EPLA demonstrate that TransTED Similarity outperforms existing methods,
achieving state-of-the-art accuracy and the highest Kappa coefficient. The
benchmark, and implementation code will be made public soon.

Abstract: We introduce WIRE: Wavelet-Induced Rotary Encodings. WIRE extends Rotary
Position Encodings (RoPE), a popular algorithm in LLMs and ViTs, to
graph-structured data. We demonstrate that WIRE is more general than RoPE,
recovering the latter in the special case of grid graphs. WIRE also enjoys a
host of desirable theoretical properties, including equivariance under node
ordering permutation, compatibility with linear attention, and (under select
assumptions) asymptotic dependence on graph resistive distance. We test WIRE on
a range of synthetic and real-world tasks, including identifying monochromatic
subgraphs, semantic segmentation of point clouds, and more standard graph
benchmarks. We find it to be effective in settings where the underlying graph
structure is important.

Conclusion: 研究强调了开发稳健且忠实的遗忘方法对于语言模型安全部署的必要性。

Abstract: Large language models trained on web-scale data can memorize private or
sensitive knowledge, raising significant privacy risks. Although some
unlearning methods mitigate these risks, they remain vulnerable to "relearning"
during subsequent training, allowing a substantial portion of forgotten
knowledge to resurface. In this paper, we show that widely used unlearning
methods cause shallow alignment: instead of faithfully erasing target
knowledge, they generate spurious unlearning neurons that amplify negative
influence to hide it. To overcome this limitation, we introduce Ssiuu, a new
class of unlearning methods that employs attribution-guided regularization to
prevent spurious negative influence and faithfully remove target knowledge.
Experimental results confirm that our method reliably erases target knowledge
and outperforms strong baselines across two practical retraining scenarios: (1)
adversarial injection of private data, and (2) benign attack using an
instruction-following benchmark. Our findings highlight the necessity of robust
and faithful unlearning methods for safe deployment of language models.

Abstract: Reliable detection of bearing faults is essential for maintaining the safety
and operational efficiency of rotating machinery. While recent advances in
machine learning (ML), particularly deep learning, have shown strong
performance in controlled settings, many studies fail to generalize to
real-world applications due to methodological flaws, most notably data leakage.
This paper investigates the issue of data leakage in vibration-based bearing
fault diagnosis and its impact on model evaluation. We demonstrate that common
dataset partitioning strategies, such as segment-wise and condition-wise
splits, introduce spurious correlations that inflate performance metrics. To
address this, we propose a rigorous, leakage-free evaluation methodology
centered on bearing-wise data partitioning, ensuring no overlap between the
physical components used for training and testing. Additionally, we reformulate
the classification task as a multi-label problem, enabling the detection of
co-occurring fault types and the use of prevalence-independent metrics such as
Macro AUROC. Beyond preventing leakage, we also examine the effect of dataset
diversity on generalization, showing that the number of unique training
bearings is a decisive factor for achieving robust performance. We evaluate our
methodology on three widely adopted datasets: CWRU, Paderborn University (PU),
and University of Ottawa (UORED-VAFCLS). This study highlights the importance
of leakage-aware evaluation protocols and provides practical guidelines for
dataset partitioning, model selection, and validation, fostering the
development of more trustworthy ML systems for industrial fault diagnosis
applications.

Conclusion: Spectral Uncertainty方法为大语言模型的不确定性量化和分解提供了有效的解决方案，在区分不同类型不确定性方面具有显著优势。

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly integrated in diverse
applications, obtaining reliable measures of their predictive uncertainty has
become critically important. A precise distinction between aleatoric
uncertainty, arising from inherent ambiguities within input data, and epistemic
uncertainty, originating exclusively from model limitations, is essential to
effectively address each uncertainty source. In this paper, we introduce
Spectral Uncertainty, a novel approach to quantifying and decomposing
uncertainties in LLMs. Leveraging the Von Neumann entropy from quantum
information theory, Spectral Uncertainty provides a rigorous theoretical
foundation for separating total uncertainty into distinct aleatoric and
epistemic components. Unlike existing baseline methods, our approach
incorporates a fine-grained representation of semantic similarity, enabling
nuanced differentiation among various semantic interpretations in model
responses. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that Spectral Uncertainty
outperforms state-of-the-art methods in estimating both aleatoric and total
uncertainty across diverse models and benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: PatchMoE框架成功解决了MoE在时间序列分析中的适应性挑战，通过任务感知的路由和时空相关性建模，为多样化时间序列任务提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Time Series Analysis is widely used in various real-world applications such
as weather forecasting, financial fraud detection, imputation for missing data
in IoT systems, and classification for action recognization. Mixture-of-Experts
(MoE), as a powerful architecture, though demonstrating effectiveness in NLP,
still falls short in adapting to versatile tasks in time series analytics due
to its task-agnostic router and the lack of capability in modeling channel
correlations. In this study, we propose a novel, general MoE-based time series
framework called PatchMoE to support the intricate ``knowledge'' utilization
for distinct tasks, thus task-aware. Based on the observation that hierarchical
representations often vary across tasks, e.g., forecasting vs. classification,
we propose a Recurrent Noisy Gating to utilize the hierarchical information in
routing, thus obtaining task-sepcific capability. And the routing strategy is
operated on time series tokens in both temporal and channel dimensions, and
encouraged by a meticulously designed Temporal \& Channel Load Balancing Loss
to model the intricate temporal and channel correlations. Comprehensive
experiments on five downstream tasks demonstrate the state-of-the-art
performance of PatchMoE.

Abstract: Semantic communication (SemCom) systems aim to learn the mapping from
low-dimensional semantics to high-dimensional ground-truth. While this is more
akin to a "domain translation" problem, existing frameworks typically emphasize
on channel-adaptive neural encoding-decoding schemes, lacking full exploration
of signal distribution. Moreover, such methods so far have employed
autoencoder-based architectures, where the encoding is tightly coupled to a
matched decoder, causing scalability issues in practice. To address these gaps,
diffusion autoencoder models are proposed for wireless SemCom. The goal is to
learn a "semantic-to-clean" mapping, from the semantic space to the
ground-truth probability distribution. A neural encoder at semantic transmitter
extracts the high-level semantics, and a conditional diffusion model (CDiff) at
the semantic receiver exploits the source distribution for signal-space
denoising, while the received semantic latents are incorporated as the
conditioning input to "steer" the decoding process towards the semantics
intended by the transmitter. It is analytically proved that the proposed
decoder model is a consistent estimator of the ground-truth data. Furthermore,
extensive simulations over CIFAR-10 and MNIST datasets are provided along with
design insights, highlighting the performance compared to legacy autoencoders
and variational autoencoders (VAE). Simulations are further extended to the
multi-user SemCom, identifying the dominating factors in a more realistic
setup.

Abstract: This paper proposes an efficient hypergraph partitioning framework based on a
novel multi-objective non-convex constrained relaxation model. A modified
accelerated proximal gradient algorithm is employed to generate diverse
$k$-dimensional vertex features to avoid local optima and enhance partition
quality. Two MST-based strategies are designed for different data scales: for
small-scale data, the Prim algorithm constructs a minimum spanning tree
followed by pruning and clustering; for large-scale data, a subset of
representative nodes is selected to build a smaller MST, while the remaining
nodes are assigned accordingly to reduce complexity. To further improve
partitioning results, refinement strategies including greedy migration,
swapping, and recursive MST-based clustering are introduced for partitions.
  Experimental results on public benchmark sets demonstrate that the proposed
algorithm achieves reductions in cut size of approximately 2\%--5\% on average
compared to KaHyPar in 2, 3, and 4-way partitioning, with improvements of up to
35\% on specific instances. Particularly on weighted vertex sets, our algorithm
outperforms state-of-the-art partitioners including KaHyPar, hMetis,
Mt-KaHyPar, and K-SpecPart, highlighting its superior partitioning quality and
competitiveness. Furthermore, the proposed refinement strategy improves hMetis
partitions by up to 16\%. A comprehensive evaluation based on virtual instance
methodology and parameter sensitivity analysis validates the algorithm's
competitiveness and characterizes its performance trade-offs.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Aurora是一个多模态时间序列基础模型，支持多模态输入和零样本推理，通过模态引导的注意力机制和原型引导的流匹配方法，在跨域时间序列预测中实现最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Method: 通过标记化、编码和蒸馏提取多模态领域知识，使用模态引导的多头自注意力机制将其注入时间表示建模，在解码阶段采用原型引导的流匹配进行生成式概率预测。

Result: 在TimeMMD、TSFM-Bench和ProbTS等基准测试中，Aurora在单模态和多模态场景下均取得一致的state-of-the-art性能。

Conclusion: Aurora通过有效利用多模态领域知识，显著提升了时间序列预测的跨域泛化能力，支持零样本推理，为多模态时间序列基础模型提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Cross-domain generalization is very important in Time Series Forecasting
because similar historical information may lead to distinct future trends due
to the domain-specific characteristics. Recent works focus on building unimodal
time series foundation models and end-to-end multimodal supervised models.
Since domain-specific knowledge is often contained in modalities like texts,
the former lacks the explicit utilization of them, thus hindering the
performance. The latter is tailored for end-to-end scenarios and does not
support zero-shot inference for cross-domain scenarios. In this work, we
introduce Aurora, a Multimodal Time Series Foundation Model, which supports
multimodal inputs and zero-shot inference. Pretrained on Corss-domain
Multimodal Time Series Corpus, Aurora can adaptively extract and focus on key
domain knowledge contained in corrsponding text or image modalities, thus
possessing strong Cross-domain generalization capability. Through tokenization,
encoding, and distillation, Aurora can extract multimodal domain knowledge as
guidance and then utilizes a Modality-Guided Multi-head Self-Attention to
inject them into the modeling of temporal representations. In the decoding
phase, the multimodal representations are used to generate the conditions and
prototypes of future tokens, contributing to a novel Prototype-Guided Flow
Matching for generative probabilistic forecasting. Comprehensive experiments on
well-recognized benchmarks, including TimeMMD, TSFM-Bench and ProbTS,
demonstrate the consistent state-of-the-art performance of Aurora on both
unimodal and multimodal scenarios.

*Ke Li,Zheng Yang,Zhongbin Zhou,Feng Xue,Zhonglin Jiang,Wenxiao Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: HEAPr是一种新颖的MoE模型剪枝算法，通过将专家分解为原子专家进行细粒度剪枝，利用二阶信息评估重要性，在保持性能的同时实现20%~25%的压缩比和20%的FLOPs减少。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MoE架构虽然性能优异且推理成本低，但参数数量庞大导致内存需求过高，限制了实际部署。现有的专家级剪枝方法粒度太粗，往往导致显著的精度下降。

Method: 将专家分解为更小的原子专家，利用类似OBS理论的二阶信息评估原子专家重要性。通过将二阶信息从专家参数转换为原子专家参数，再简化为原子专家输出的二阶信息，将空间复杂度从O(d^4)降低到O(d^2)。仅需在小校准集上进行两次前向传播和一次反向传播。

Result: 在DeepSeek MoE和Qwen MoE等模型上的实验表明，HEAPr在广泛的压缩比和基准测试中优于现有专家级剪枝方法。在大多数模型中实现20%~25%压缩比时几乎无精度损失，同时减少约20%的FLOPs。

Conclusion: HEAPr通过原子专家剪枝和高效二阶信息利用，为MoE模型提供了精确且灵活的压缩方案，显著降低了内存需求和计算成本，同时保持了模型性能。

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures in large language models (LLMs)
deliver exceptional performance and reduced inference costs compared to dense
LLMs. However, their large parameter counts result in prohibitive memory
requirements, limiting practical deployment. While existing pruning methods
primarily focus on expert-level pruning, this coarse granularity often leads to
substantial accuracy degradation. In this work, we introduce HEAPr, a novel
pruning algorithm that decomposes experts into smaller, indivisible atomic
experts, enabling more precise and flexible atomic expert pruning. To measure
the importance of each atomic expert, we leverage second-order information
based on principles similar to Optimal Brain Surgeon (OBS) theory. To address
the computational and storage challenges posed by second-order information,
HEAPr exploits the inherent properties of atomic experts to transform the
second-order information from expert parameters into that of atomic expert
parameters, and further simplifies it to the second-order information of atomic
expert outputs. This approach reduces the space complexity from $O(d^4)$, where
d is the model's dimensionality, to $O(d^2)$. HEAPr requires only two forward
passes and one backward pass on a small calibration set to compute the
importance of atomic experts. Extensive experiments on MoE models, including
DeepSeek MoE and Qwen MoE family, demonstrate that HEAPr outperforms existing
expert-level pruning methods across a wide range of compression ratios and
benchmarks. Specifically, HEAPr achieves nearly lossless compression at
compression ratios of 20% ~ 25% in most models, while also reducing FLOPs
nearly by 20%. The code can be found at

Motivation: 传统化学表示方法缺乏针对溶剂的物理背景信息，而有害溶剂的使用是化工行业主要气候问题，绿色溶剂替换研究需求迫切。

Method: 开发SoDaDE方法，使用小型Transformer模型和溶剂属性数据集来创建数据驱动的溶剂指纹表示。

Result: 在最近发布的产率预测数据集上，SoDaDE表现优于之前的表示方法，证明了数据驱动指纹在小数据集上的有效性。

Conclusion: 数据驱动指纹可以在小数据集上创建，并建立了可应用于其他领域的工作流程。

Abstract: Computational representations have become crucial in unlocking the recent
growth of machine learning algorithms for chemistry. Initially hand-designed,
machine learning has shown that meaningful representations can be learnt from
data. Chemical datasets are limited and so the representations learnt from data
are generic, being trained on broad datasets which contain shallow information
on many different molecule types. For example, generic fingerprints lack
physical context specific to solvents. However, the use of harmful solvents is
a leading climate-related issue in the chemical industry, and there is a surge
of interest in green solvent replacement. To empower this research, we propose
a new solvent representation scheme by developing Solvent Data Driven
Embeddings (SoDaDE). SoDaDE uses a small transformer model and solvent property
dataset to create a fingerprint for solvents. To showcase their effectiveness,
we use SoDaDE to predict yields on a recently published dataset, outperforming
previous representations. We demonstrate through this paper that data-driven
fingerprints can be made with small datasets and set-up a workflow that can be
explored for other applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 强化学习通常需要大量交互数据，实际部署受限。现有方法依赖先验知识（如预收集数据集或参考策略），但在训练与部署任务不匹配时效果下降，且现有工作主要局限于分布内设置。

Method: APB是一种元迁移强化学习方法，在共享骨干网络前后插入轻量级线性层，实现参数高效微调，在适应过程中保持先验知识。

Result: APB相比标准强化学习提高了样本效率，并能适应分布外任务，而现有元强化学习基线方法通常在这些任务上失败。

Conclusion: APB方法通过参数高效微调机制，有效解决了强化学习在任务不匹配情况下的适应问题，特别是在分布外任务上表现出色。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has achieved impressive results across domains,
yet learning an optimal policy typically requires extensive interaction data,
limiting practical deployment. A common remedy is to leverage priors, such as
pre-collected datasets or reference policies, but their utility degrades under
task mismatch between training and deployment. While prior work has sought to
address this mismatch, it has largely been restricted to in-distribution
settings. To address this challenge, we propose Adaptive Policy Backbone (APB),
a meta-transfer RL method that inserts lightweight linear layers before and
after a shared backbone, thereby enabling parameter-efficient fine-tuning
(PEFT) while preserving prior knowledge during adaptation. Our results show
that APB improves sample efficiency over standard RL and adapts to
out-of-distribution (OOD) tasks where existing meta-RL baselines typically
fail.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出渐进式权重加载(PWL)方法，通过先部署轻量学生模型，然后逐步替换为预训练教师模型的层，在保持初始推理速度的同时实现性能渐进提升


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习模型日益庞大复杂，导致内存消耗和计算需求增加，模型加载时间和初始推理延迟显著上升，在移动和延迟敏感环境中影响用户体验

Method: 提出PWL技术，先部署轻量学生模型，然后逐步替换为教师模型层；引入训练方法对齐学生和教师层的中间特征表示，提升学生模型整体输出性能

Result: 在VGG、ResNet和ViT架构上的实验表明，PWL训练的模型保持竞争力的蒸馏性能，随着教师层加载逐步提升准确率，最终达到完整教师模型的准确率

Conclusion: PWL特别适合动态、资源受限的部署场景，在保持响应性的同时不牺牲最终性能

Abstract: Deep learning models have become increasingly large and complex, resulting in
higher memory consumption and computational demands. Consequently, model
loading times and initial inference latency have increased, posing significant
challenges in mobile and latency-sensitive environments where frequent model
loading and unloading are required, which directly impacts user experience.
While Knowledge Distillation (KD) offers a solution by compressing large
teacher models into smaller student ones, it often comes at the cost of reduced
performance. To address this trade-off, we propose Progressive Weight Loading
(PWL), a novel technique that enables fast initial inference by first deploying
a lightweight student model, then incrementally replacing its layers with those
of a pre-trained teacher model. To support seamless layer substitution, we
introduce a training method that not only aligns intermediate feature
representations between student and teacher layers, but also improves the
overall output performance of the student model. Our experiments on VGG,
ResNet, and ViT architectures demonstrate that models trained with PWL maintain
competitive distillation performance and gradually improve accuracy as teacher
layers are loaded-matching the final accuracy of the full teacher model without
compromising initial inference speed. This makes PWL particularly suited for
dynamic, resource-constrained deployments where both responsiveness and
performance are critical.

where agents maintain a local AM to recall their own associations as well as
selective information from others. Specifically, we introduce a distributed

through communication over routing trees. Our theoretical analysis establishes
sublinear regret guarantees, and experiments demonstrate that the proposed
protocol consistently outperforms existing online optimization baselines.

TL;DR: 该论文研究了深度持续学习中神经网络失去可塑性的原因，发现这是由于Hessian谱崩溃导致的，并提出通过保持高有效特征秩和L2正则化来维持网络可塑性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究深度神经网络在深度持续学习中为何会失去可塑性，无法学习新任务而需要重新初始化参数。

Method: 引入τ-可训练性概念，基于Hessian的Kronecker分解近似，提出两种正则化增强方法：维持高有效特征秩和应用L2惩罚。

Result: 在持续监督学习和强化学习任务上的实验表明，结合这两种正则化器能有效保持网络可塑性。

Conclusion: Hessian谱崩溃是导致深度持续学习中可塑性丧失的关键原因，通过针对性的正则化方法可以有效维持网络的学习能力。

Abstract: We investigate why deep neural networks suffer from \emph{loss of plasticity}
in deep continual learning, failing to learn new tasks without reinitializing
parameters. We show that this failure is preceded by Hessian spectral collapse
at new-task initialization, where meaningful curvature directions vanish and
gradient descent becomes ineffective. To characterize the necessary condition
for successful training, we introduce the notion of $\tau$-trainability and
show that current plasticity preserving algorithms can be unified under this
framework. Targeting spectral collapse directly, we then discuss the Kronecker
factored approximation of the Hessian, which motivates two regularization
enhancements: maintaining high effective feature rank and applying $L2$
penalties. Experiments on continual supervised and reinforcement learning tasks
confirm that combining these two regularizers effectively preserves plasticity.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生存数据通常包含不完整的事件信息（如删失数据），这对合成数据生成提出了独特挑战，需要同时忠实再现事件时间分布和删失机制。

Method: 提出SurvDiff扩散模型，使用生存定制的损失函数联合生成混合类型协变量、事件时间和右删失，该损失函数编码时间到事件结构并直接优化下游生存任务。

Result: 在多个数据集上，SurvDiff在分布保真度和下游评估指标方面始终优于最先进的生成基线方法。

Conclusion: SurvDiff是首个明确为生成合成生存数据设计的扩散模型，能够真实再现事件时间分布并保持删失机制。

Abstract: Survival analysis is a cornerstone of clinical research by modeling
time-to-event outcomes such as metastasis, disease relapse, or patient death.
Unlike standard tabular data, survival data often come with incomplete event
information due to dropout, or loss to follow-up. This poses unique challenges
for synthetic data generation, where it is crucial for clinical research to
faithfully reproduce both the event-time distribution and the censoring
mechanism. In this paper, we propose SurvDiff, an end-to-end diffusion model
specifically designed for generating synthetic data in survival analysis.
SurvDiff is tailored to capture the data-generating mechanism by jointly
generating mixed-type covariates, event times, and right-censoring, guided by a
survival-tailored loss function. The loss encodes the time-to-event structure
and directly optimizes for downstream survival tasks, which ensures that
SurvDiff (i) reproduces realistic event-time distributions and (ii) preserves
the censoring mechanism. Across multiple datasets, we show that \survdiff
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art generative baselines in both
distributional fidelity and downstream evaluation metrics across multiple
medical datasets. To the best of our knowledge, SurvDiff is the first diffusion
model explicitly designed for generating synthetic survival data.

Motivation: 现有静态世界模型在处理新颖或罕见环境配置时表现不佳，需要研究世界模型如何动态适应环境变化。

Method: 形式化情境环境学习，识别环境识别和环境学习两种机制，推导误差上界，并通过实验验证不同ICL机制在世界模型中的存在。

Result: 实证确认世界模型中存在不同的情境学习机制，发现数据分布和模型架构以符合理论的方式影响ICL，长上下文和多样化环境是ICEL出现的关键因素。

Conclusion: 研究展示了自适应世界模型的潜力，揭示了ICEL机制出现的关键因素，特别是长上下文和多样化环境的必要性。

Abstract: The capability of predicting environmental dynamics underpins both biological
neural systems and general embodied AI in adapting to their surroundings. Yet
prevailing approaches rest on static world models that falter when confronted
with novel or rare configurations. We investigate in-context environment
learning (ICEL), shifting attention from zero-shot performance to the growth
and asymptotic limits of the world model. Our contributions are three-fold: (1)
we formalize in-context learning of a world model and identify two core
mechanisms: environment recognition and environment learning; (2) we derive
error upper-bounds for both mechanisms that expose how the mechanisms emerge;
and (3) we empirically confirm that distinct ICL mechanisms exist in the world
model, and we further investigate how data distribution and model architecture
affect ICL in a manner consistent with theory. These findings demonstrate the
potential of self-adapting world models and highlight the key factors behind
the emergence of ICEL, most notably the necessity of long context and diverse
environments.

TL;DR: 提出随机激活函数策略，在LLM的前馈层中随机选择SILU或RELU非线性函数，解决RELU的优化问题，并在预训练和生成任务中验证其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决RELU激活函数在负输入区域梯度消失的问题，同时探索在生成任务中增加文本多样性的方法。

Method: 使用伯努利分布随机选择SILU或RELU激活函数，在预训练阶段使用随机激活，推理时固定为RELU以获得稀疏性和加速效果。

Result: 预训练阶段使用随机激活后微调为RELU，比直接使用RELU训练效果更好，推理速度更快；在生成任务中表现接近最佳确定性非线性函数。

Conclusion: 随机激活函数策略有效解决了RELU的优化问题，提供了控制文本多样性的新方法，在推理效率和生成质量上都有优势。

Abstract: We introduce stochastic activations. This novel strategy randomly selects
between several non-linear functions in the feed-forward layer of a large
language model. In particular, we choose between SILU or RELU depending on a
Bernoulli draw. This strategy circumvents the optimization problem associated
with RELU, namely, the constant shape for negative inputs that prevents the
gradient flow. We leverage this strategy in two ways:
  (1) We use stochastic activations during pre-training and fine-tune the model
with RELU, which is used at inference time to provide sparse latent vectors.
This reduces the inference FLOPs and translates into a significant speedup in
the CPU. Interestingly, this leads to much better results than training from
scratch with the RELU activation function.
  (2) We evaluate stochastic activations for generation. This strategy performs
reasonably well: it is only slightly inferior to the best deterministic
non-linearity, namely SILU combined with temperature scaling. This offers an
alternative to existing strategies by providing a controlled way to increase
the diversity of the generated text.

Conclusion: 神经特征几何的演化类似于离散Ricci流，这一发现为理解神经网络工作原理提供了新的几何视角，并具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Deep neural networks learn feature representations via complex geometric
transformations of the input data manifold. Despite the models' empirical
success across domains, our understanding of neural feature representations is
still incomplete. In this work we investigate neural feature geometry through
the lens of discrete geometry. Since the input data manifold is typically
unobserved, we approximate it using geometric graphs that encode local
similarity structure. We provide theoretical results on the evolution of these
graphs during training, showing that nonlinear activations play a crucial role
in shaping feature geometry in feedforward neural networks. Moreover, we
discover that the geometric transformations resemble a discrete Ricci flow on
these graphs, suggesting that neural feature geometry evolves analogous to
Ricci flow. This connection is supported by experiments on over 20,000
feedforward neural networks trained on binary classification tasks across both
synthetic and real-world datasets. We observe that the emergence of class
separability corresponds to the emergence of community structure in the
associated graph representations, which is known to relate to discrete Ricci
flow dynamics. Building on these insights, we introduce a novel framework for
locally evaluating geometric transformations through comparison with discrete
Ricci flow dynamics. Our results suggest practical design principles, including
a geometry-informed early-stopping heuristic and a criterion for selecting
network depth.

TL;DR: 该研究评估了大型音频语言模型（LALMs）中思维链（CoT）的忠实性，通过多种干预方法在SAKURA和MMAR数据集上进行测试，发现LALMs生成的CoT通常能忠实反映其决策过程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 先前研究表明文本LLMs的思维链往往不忠实，但LALMs中的忠实性问题尚未探索。由于LALMs需要先从音频中提取线索再进行推理，其忠实性对安全敏感应用至关重要。

Method: 应用了多种针对性干预方法：转述、填充标记注入、提前回答和引入错误，在SAKURA和MMAR两个推理数据集上进行测试。

Result: 实验表明，经过多种干预测试后，LALMs生成的思维链总体上能够忠实反映其底层决策过程。

Conclusion: 与文本LLMs不同，LALMs产生的思维链具有较高的忠实性，这对安全敏感应用具有重要意义。

Abstract: Faithfulness measures whether chain-of-thought (CoT) representations
accurately reflect a model's decision process and can be used as reliable
explanations. Prior work has shown that CoTs from text-based LLMs are often
unfaithful. This question has not been explored for large audio-language models
(LALMs), where faithfulness is critical for safety-sensitive applications.
Reasoning in LALMs is also more challenging, as models must first extract
relevant clues from audio before reasoning over them. In this paper, we
investigate the faithfulness of CoTs produced by several LALMs by applying
targeted interventions, including paraphrasing, filler token injection, early
answering, and introducing mistakes, on two challenging reasoning datasets:
SAKURA and MMAR. After going through the aforementioned interventions across
several datasets and tasks, our experiments suggest that, LALMs generally
produce CoTs that appear to be faithful to their underlying decision processes.

Conclusion: 该研究为战略金融决策支持开发了更准确可靠的计算模型，成功解决了信用风险建模中的三个基本挑战。

Abstract: Effective credit risk management is fundamental to financial decision-making,
necessitating robust models for default probability prediction and financial
entity classification. Traditional machine learning approaches face significant
challenges when confronted with high-dimensional data, limited
interpretability, rare event detection, and multi-class imbalance problems in
risk assessment. This research proposes a comprehensive meta-learning framework
that synthesizes multiple complementary models: supervised learning algorithms,
including XGBoost, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, and Decision Tree;
unsupervised methods such as K-Nearest Neighbors; deep learning architectures
like Multilayer Perceptron; alongside LASSO regularization for feature
selection and dimensionality reduction; and Error-Correcting Output Codes as a
meta-classifier for handling imbalanced multi-class problems. We implement
Permutation Feature Importance analysis for each prediction class across all
constituent models to enhance model transparency. Our framework aims to
optimize predictive performance while providing a more holistic approach to
credit risk assessment. This research contributes to the development of more
accurate and reliable computational models for strategic financial decision
support by addressing three fundamental challenges in credit risk modeling. The
empirical validation of our approach involves an analysis of the Corporate
Credit Ratings dataset with credit ratings for 2,029 publicly listed US
companies. Results demonstrate that our meta-learning framework significantly
enhances the accuracy of financial entity classification regarding credit
rating migrations (upgrades and downgrades) and default probability estimation.

Conclusion: 使用基于损失函数的稀疏化技术相比随机分布方法可以获得更好的结果。

Abstract: Deep neural networks are widely used in practical applications of AI,
however, their inner structure and complexity made them generally not easily
interpretable. Model transparency and interpretability are key requirements for
multiple scenarios where high performance is not enough to adopt the proposed
solution. In this work, a differentiable approximation of $L_0$ regularization
is adapted into a logic-based neural network, the Multi-layer Logical
Perceptron (MLLP), to study its efficacy in reducing the complexity of its
discrete interpretable version, the Concept Rule Set (CRS), while retaining its
performance. The results are compared to alternative heuristics like Random
Binarization of the network weights, to determine if better results can be
achieved when using a less-noisy technique that sparsifies the network based on
the loss function instead of a random distribution. The trade-off between the
CRS complexity and its performance is discussed.

TL;DR: 提出了SpinGPT，这是首个针对三人在线扑克格式Spin & Go的LLM模型，通过监督微调和强化学习训练，在多人不完全信息游戏中表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CFR算法在多人游戏中计算复杂度指数级增长，且纳什均衡不再保证非负结果，限制了其在流行锦标赛格式中的应用。受LLM在棋类和外交游戏中的成功启发，探索LLM在多人不完全信息游戏中的潜力。

Method: 两阶段训练：1) 在32万手高注额专家决策上进行监督微调；2) 在27万手求解器生成的手牌上进行强化学习。

Result: SpinGPT在78%的决策中与求解器行动一致（容忍准确率）。使用简单深筹码启发式方法，在3万手牌中对Slumbot达到13.4±12.9 BB/100的胜率（95%置信区间）。

Conclusion: LLM可能是处理多人不完全信息游戏（如扑克）的新方法，展示了在多人扑克格式中的潜力。

Abstract: The Counterfactual Regret Minimization (CFR) algorithm and its variants have
enabled the development of pokerbots capable of beating the best human players
in heads-up (1v1) cash games and competing with them in six-player formats.
However, CFR's computational complexity rises exponentially with the number of
players. Furthermore, in games with three or more players, following Nash
equilibrium no longer guarantees a non-losing outcome. These limitations, along
with others, significantly restrict the applicability of CFR to the most
popular formats: tournaments. Motivated by the recent success of Large Language
Models (LLM) in chess and Diplomacy, we present SpinGPT, the first LLM tailored
to Spin & Go, a popular three-player online poker format. SpinGPT is trained in
two stages: (1) Supervised Fine-Tuning on 320k high-stakes expert decisions;
(2) Reinforcement Learning on 270k solver-generated hands. Our results show
that SpinGPT matches the solver's actions in 78% of decisions (tolerant
accuracy). With a simple deep-stack heuristic, it achieves 13.4 +/- 12.9 BB/100
versus Slumbot in heads-up over 30,000 hands (95% CI). These results suggest
that LLMs could be a new way to deal with multi-player imperfect-information
games like poker.

Motivation: 利率下降和经济稳定化提高了死亡率预测的重要性，特别是在保险和养老金市场。多步预测对公共卫生、人口规划和保险风险评估至关重要，但在数据有限时面临挑战。

Method: 使用混合系统结合统计和机器学习模型处理线性和非线性模式，评估了递归、直接和多输入多输出三种多步预测方法，以及不同ML模型对12个数据集和21个模型的影响。

Result: 结果表明，多步预测方法和ML模型的选择对提高性能至关重要，ARIMA-LSTM混合模型使用递归方法在大多数情况下优于其他模型。

Conclusion: 选择合适的多步预测方法和ML模型对混合系统的性能有显著影响，ARIMA-LSTM混合模型结合递归方法是死亡率预测的有效解决方案。

Abstract: The decline in interest rates and economic stabilization has heightened the
importance of accurate mortality rate forecasting, particularly in insurance
and pension markets. Multi-step-ahead predictions are crucial for public
health, demographic planning, and insurance risk assessments; however, they
face challenges when data are limited. Hybrid systems that combine statistical
and Machine Learning (ML) models offer a promising solution for handling both
linear and nonlinear patterns. This study evaluated the impact of different
multi-step forecasting approaches (Recursive, Direct, and Multi-Input
Multi-Output) and ML models on the accuracy of hybrid systems. Results from 12
datasets and 21 models show that the selection of both the multi-step approach
and the ML model is essential for improving performance, with the ARIMA-LSTM
hybrid using a recursive approach outperforming other models in most cases.

Result: 在复杂长视野操作任务中显著加速学习并实现优于最先进方法的性能。

Conclusion: ReLAM通过自动生成结构化奖励有效解决了视觉强化学习中的奖励设计挑战。

Abstract: Reward design remains a critical bottleneck in visual reinforcement learning
(RL) for robotic manipulation. In simulated environments, rewards are
conventionally designed based on the distance to a target position. However,
such precise positional information is often unavailable in real-world visual
settings due to sensory and perceptual limitations. In this study, we propose a
method that implicitly infers spatial distances through keypoints extracted
from images. Building on this, we introduce Reward Learning with Anticipation
Model (ReLAM), a novel framework that automatically generates dense, structured
rewards from action-free video demonstrations. ReLAM first learns an
anticipation model that serves as a planner and proposes intermediate
keypoint-based subgoals on the optimal path to the final goal, creating a
structured learning curriculum directly aligned with the task's geometric
objectives. Based on the anticipated subgoals, a continuous reward signal is
provided to train a low-level, goal-conditioned policy under the hierarchical
reinforcement learning (HRL) framework with provable sub-optimality bound.
Extensive experiments on complex, long-horizon manipulation tasks show that
ReLAM significantly accelerates learning and achieves superior performance
compared to state-of-the-art methods.

TL;DR: MoveFM-R是一个结合移动基础模型和大型语言模型的新框架，通过语义增强位置编码、渐进式课程学习和交互式自反机制，解决地理坐标与语言词汇不匹配的问题，显著提升了人类移动轨迹生成的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有移动基础模型在数据规模和语义理解方面存在局限，而大型语言模型虽然具备强大的语义推理能力，但缺乏对时空统计的固有理解。需要结合两者的优势来生成更真实的移动轨迹。

Method: 提出三个核心创新：语义增强位置编码来弥合地理与语言之间的差距；渐进式课程学习来对齐LLM推理与移动模式；交互式自反机制用于条件轨迹生成。

Result: 大量实验表明，MoveFM-R显著优于现有的MFM和LLM基线方法，在零样本设置下展现出强大的泛化能力，并能从自然语言指令生成真实的轨迹。

Conclusion: 通过将MFMs的统计能力与LLMs的深度语义理解相结合，MoveFM-R开创了一个更全面、可解释和强大的人类移动建模新范式。

Abstract: Mobility Foundation Models (MFMs) have advanced the modeling of human
movement patterns, yet they face a ceiling due to limitations in data scale and
semantic understanding. While Large Language Models (LLMs) offer powerful
semantic reasoning, they lack the innate understanding of spatio-temporal
statistics required for generating physically plausible mobility trajectories.
To address these gaps, we propose MoveFM-R, a novel framework that unlocks the
full potential of mobility foundation models by leveraging language-driven
semantic reasoning capabilities. It tackles two key challenges: the vocabulary
mismatch between continuous geographic coordinates and discrete language
tokens, and the representation gap between the latent vectors of MFMs and the
semantic world of LLMs. MoveFM-R is built on three core innovations: a
semantically enhanced location encoding to bridge the geography-language gap, a
progressive curriculum to align the LLM's reasoning with mobility patterns, and
an interactive self-reflection mechanism for conditional trajectory generation.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that MoveFM-R significantly outperforms
existing MFM-based and LLM-based baselines. It also shows robust generalization
in zero-shot settings and excels at generating realistic trajectories from
natural language instructions. By synthesizing the statistical power of MFMs
with the deep semantic understanding of LLMs, MoveFM-R pioneers a new paradigm
that enables a more comprehensive, interpretable, and powerful modeling of
human mobility. The implementation of MoveFM-R is available online at
https://anonymous.4open.science/r/MoveFM-R-CDE7/.

Abstract: The lattice Boltzmann equation (LBE), rooted in kinetic theory, provides a
powerful framework for capturing complex flow behaviour by describing the
evolution of single-particle distribution functions (PDFs). Despite its
success, solving the LBE numerically remains computationally intensive due to
strict time-step restrictions imposed by collision kernels. Here, we introduce
a physics-informed neural operator framework for the LBE that enables
prediction over large time horizons without step-by-step integration,
effectively bypassing the need to explicitly solve the collision kernel. We
incorporate intrinsic moment-matching constraints of the LBE, along with global
equivariance of the full distribution field, enabling the model to capture the
complex dynamics of the underlying kinetic system. Our framework is
discretization-invariant, enabling models trained on coarse lattices to
generalise to finer ones (kinetic super-resolution). In addition, it is
agnostic to the specific form of the underlying collision model, which makes it
naturally applicable across different kinetic datasets regardless of the
governing dynamics. Our results demonstrate robustness across complex flow
scenarios, including von Karman vortex shedding, ligament breakup, and bubble
adhesion. This establishes a new data-driven pathway for modelling kinetic
systems.

Conclusion: 图提示学习应专注于释放预训练模型的能力，而分类器应适应下游场景，UniPrompt方法为此提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Graph Prompt Learning (GPL) has emerged as a promising paradigm that bridges
graph pretraining models and downstream scenarios, mitigating label dependency
and the misalignment between upstream pretraining and downstream tasks.
Although existing GPL studies explore various prompt strategies, their
effectiveness and underlying principles remain unclear. We identify two
critical limitations: (1) Lack of consensus on underlying mechanisms: Despite
current GPLs have advanced the field, there is no consensus on how prompts
interact with pretrained models, as different strategies intervene at varying
spaces within the model, i.e., input-level, layer-wise, and
representation-level prompts. (2) Limited scenario adaptability: Most methods
fail to generalize across diverse downstream scenarios, especially under data
distribution shifts (e.g., homophilic-to-heterophilic graphs). To address these
issues, we theoretically analyze existing GPL approaches and reveal that
representation-level prompts essentially function as fine-tuning a simple
downstream classifier, proposing that graph prompt learning should focus on
unleashing the capability of pretrained models, and the classifier adapts to
downstream scenarios. Based on our findings, we propose UniPrompt, a novel GPL
method that adapts any pretrained models, unleashing the capability of
pretrained models while preserving the structure of the input graph. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our method can effectively integrate with various
pretrained models and achieve strong performance across in-domain and
cross-domain scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有分布式训练方法通过减少全局同步频率来降低通信开销，但效率仍有提升空间。需要更有效的方法来减少内存使用和计算成本。

Method: 在本地更新步骤中，每个节点只更新固定的参数子集，其余参数保持冻结。同时进行全参数前向传播以避免跨节点激活交换。

Result: 在32节点上训练13亿参数语言模型的实验表明，该方法在相同token和带宽预算下达到与现有低通信方法相当的困惑度，同时显著减少训练FLOPs和峰值内存。

Conclusion: 通过限制反向传播范围，该方法在保持模型性能的同时，有效提升了分布式训练的内存和计算效率。

Abstract: We introduce a memory- and compute-efficient method for low-communication
distributed training. Existing methods reduce communication by performing
multiple local updates between infrequent global synchronizations. We
demonstrate that their efficiency can be significantly improved by restricting
backpropagation: instead of updating all the parameters, each node updates only
a fixed subset while keeping the remainder frozen during local steps. This
constraint substantially reduces peak memory usage and training FLOPs, while a
full forward pass over all parameters eliminates the need for cross-node
activation exchange. Experiments on a $1.3$B-parameter language model trained
across $32$ nodes show that our method matches the perplexity of prior
low-communication approaches under identical token and bandwidth budgets while
reducing training FLOPs and peak memory.

Motivation: 博弈学习中多个智能体独立学习策略时存在优化差异，时间延迟会阻碍对未来奖励的预测，降低OFTRL算法的性能。

Method: 提出了加权OFTRL算法，对OFTRL中的下一个奖励预测向量进行n次加权，通过调整乐观权重来抵消时间延迟的影响。

Result: 当乐观权重超过时间延迟时，WOFTRL在一般和正规形式博弈中实现常数遗憾(O(1)-regret)，在多矩阵零和博弈中策略收敛到纳什均衡(最佳迭代收敛)。

Conclusion: WOFTRL算法能有效解决博弈学习中的时间延迟问题，理论结果得到实验验证和支持。

Abstract: This study raises and addresses the problem of time-delayed feedback in
learning in games. Because learning in games assumes that multiple agents
independently learn their strategies, a discrepancy in optimization often
emerges among the agents. To overcome this discrepancy, the prediction of the
future reward is incorporated into algorithms, typically known as Optimistic
Follow-the-Regularized-Leader (OFTRL). However, the time delay in observing the
past rewards hinders the prediction. Indeed, this study firstly proves that
even a single-step delay worsens the performance of OFTRL from the aspects of
regret and convergence. This study proposes the weighted OFTRL (WOFTRL), where
the prediction vector of the next reward in OFTRL is weighted $n$ times. We
further capture an intuition that the optimistic weight cancels out this time
delay. We prove that when the optimistic weight exceeds the time delay, our
WOFTRL recovers the good performances that the regret is constant
($O(1)$-regret) in general-sum normal-form games, and the strategies converge
to the Nash equilibrium as a subsequence (best-iterate convergence) in
poly-matrix zero-sum games. The theoretical results are supported and
strengthened by our experiments.

Motivation: 传统Vietoris-Rips复形计算复杂度呈指数级增长，Alpha复形和稀疏Rips近似等方法仍会产生过多单纯形，限制了在大规模点云数据上的应用。

Method: 引入Flood复形，通过从点云子集的Delaunay三角剖分中选择被半径为r的球完全覆盖的单纯形，实现高效持久同调计算，并支持GPU并行化。

Conclusion: Flood复形为解决大规模点云数据的持久同调计算提供了可扩展的解决方案，特别适用于几何或拓扑复杂的物体分析。

Abstract: We consider the problem of computing persistent homology (PH) for large-scale
Euclidean point cloud data, aimed at downstream machine learning tasks, where
the exponential growth of the most widely-used Vietoris-Rips complex imposes
serious computational limitations. Although more scalable alternatives such as
the Alpha complex or sparse Rips approximations exist, they often still result
in a prohibitively large number of simplices. This poses challenges in the
complex construction and in the subsequent PH computation, prohibiting their
use on large-scale point clouds. To mitigate these issues, we introduce the
Flood complex, inspired by the advantages of the Alpha and Witness complex
constructions. Informally, at a given filtration value $r\geq 0$, the Flood
complex contains all simplices from a Delaunay triangulation of a small subset
of the point cloud $X$ that are fully covered by balls of radius $r$ emanating
from $X$, a process we call flooding. Our construction allows for efficient PH
computation, possesses several desirable theoretical properties, and is
amenable to GPU parallelization. Scaling experiments on 3D point cloud data
show that we can compute PH of up to dimension 2 on several millions of points.
Importantly, when evaluating object classification performance on real-world
and synthetic data, we provide evidence that this scaling capability is needed,
especially if objects are geometrically or topologically complex, yielding
performance superior to other PH-based methods and neural networks for point
cloud data.

Result: 平滑激活函数保证前向和后向ODE的全局唯一解，充分非线性维持NTK谱特性，实现过参数化下的全局收敛

Conclusion: 激活函数的平滑性和非线性特性对神经ODE的全局收敛至关重要，为实际应用提供了理论指导

Abstract: Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs) have been successful in various
applications due to their continuous nature and parameter-sharing efficiency.
However, these unique characteristics also introduce challenges in training,
particularly with respect to gradient computation accuracy and convergence
analysis. In this paper, we address these challenges by investigating the
impact of activation functions. We demonstrate that the properties of
activation functions, specifically smoothness and nonlinearity, are critical to
the training dynamics. Smooth activation functions guarantee globally unique
solutions for both forward and backward ODEs, while sufficient nonlinearity is
essential for maintaining the spectral properties of the Neural Tangent Kernel
(NTK) during training. Together, these properties enable us to establish the
global convergence of Neural ODEs under gradient descent in overparameterized
regimes. Our theoretical findings are validated by numerical experiments, which
not only support our analysis but also provide practical guidelines for scaling
Neural ODEs, potentially leading to faster training and improved performance in
real-world applications.

Conclusion: 提供了具有强渐近保证的描述长度目标的理论框架，为实现更高压缩和泛化的神经网络训练指明了潜在路径。

Abstract: The Minimum Description Length (MDL) principle offers a formal framework for
applying Occam's razor in machine learning. However, its application to neural
networks such as Transformers is challenging due to the lack of a principled,
universal measure for model complexity. This paper introduces the theoretical
notion of asymptotically optimal description length objectives, grounded in the
theory of Kolmogorov complexity. We establish that a minimizer of such an
objective achieves optimal compression, for any dataset, up to an additive
constant, in the limit as model resource bounds increase. We prove that
asymptotically optimal objectives exist for Transformers, building on a new
demonstration of their computational universality. We further show that such
objectives can be tractable and differentiable by constructing and analyzing a
variational objective based on an adaptive Gaussian mixture prior. Our
empirical analysis shows that this variational objective selects for a
low-complexity solution with strong generalization on an algorithmic task, but
standard optimizers fail to find such solutions from a random initialization,
highlighting key optimization challenges. More broadly, by providing a
theoretical framework for identifying description length objectives with strong
asymptotic guarantees, we outline a potential path towards training neural
networks that achieve greater compression and generalization.

Conclusion: IPFM是有效的静电生成模型蒸馏框架，有限D值的PFGM++模型具有更优的优化和采样特性

Abstract: Electrostatic generative models such as PFGM++ have recently emerged as a
powerful framework, achieving state-of-the-art performance in image synthesis.
PFGM++ operates in an extended data space with auxiliary dimensionality $D$,
recovering the diffusion model framework as $D\to\infty$, while yielding
superior empirical results for finite $D$. Like diffusion models, PFGM++ relies
on expensive ODE simulations to generate samples, making it computationally
costly. To address this, we propose Inverse Poisson Flow Matching (IPFM), a
novel distillation framework that accelerates electrostatic generative models
across all values of $D$. Our IPFM reformulates distillation as an inverse
problem: learning a generator whose induced electrostatic field matches that of
the teacher. We derive a tractable training objective for this problem and show
that, as $D \to \infty$, our IPFM closely recovers Score Identity Distillation
(SiD), a recent method for distilling diffusion models. Empirically, our IPFM
produces distilled generators that achieve near-teacher or even superior sample
quality using only a few function evaluations. Moreover, we observe that
distillation converges faster for finite $D$ than in the $D \to \infty$
(diffusion) limit, which is consistent with prior findings that finite-$D$
PFGM++ models exhibit more favorable optimization and sampling properties.

Motivation: 现有物理信息图神经网络(PIGNNs)作为AC潮流快速求解器，在精度方面仍需改进，特别是物理损失在推理时无效，这阻碍了其在操作中的采用。

Method: 提出PIGNN-Attn-LS方法：1）边缘感知注意力机制，通过每边偏置显式编码线路物理特性，捕捉电网各向异性；2）基于回溯线搜索的全局化校正算子，在推理时恢复有效的下降准则。

Result: 在4-32总线电网的测试中，电压测试RMSE为0.00033 p.u.，角度为0.08°，分别比PIGNN-MLP基线提升99.5%和87.1%。使用流式微批次时，在4-1024总线电网上比NR快2-5倍。

Conclusion: PIGNN-Attn-LS通过结合注意力机制和校正算子，显著提升了物理信息图神经网络在AC潮流求解中的精度和效率，为电网操作提供了可靠的快速求解方案。

Abstract: Physics-informed graph neural networks (PIGNNs) have emerged as fast AC
power-flow solvers that can replace classic Newton--Raphson (NR) solvers,
especially when thousands of scenarios must be evaluated. However, current
PIGNNs still need accuracy improvements at parity speed; in particular, the
physics loss is inoperative at inference, which can deter operational adoption.
We address this with PIGNN-Attn-LS, combining an edge-aware attention mechanism
that explicitly encodes line physics via per-edge biases, capturing the grid's
anisotropy, with a backtracking line-search-based globalized correction
operator that restores an operative decrease criterion at inference. Training
and testing use a realistic High-/Medium-Voltage scenario generator, with NR
used only to construct reference states. On held-out HV cases consisting of
4--32-bus grids, PIGNN-Attn-LS achieves a test RMSE of 0.00033 p.u. in voltage
and 0.08$^\circ$ in angle, outperforming the PIGNN-MLP baseline by 99.5\% and
87.1\%, respectively. With streaming micro-batches, it delivers 2--5$\times$
faster batched inference than NR on 4--1024-bus grids.

Abstract: We propose a reduced-space formulation for optimizing over trained neural
networks where the network's outputs and derivatives are evaluated on a GPU. To
do this, we treat the neural network as a "gray box" where intermediate
variables and constraints are not exposed to the optimization solver. Compared
to the full-space formulation, in which intermediate variables and constraints
are exposed to the optimization solver, the reduced-space formulation leads to
faster solves and fewer iterations in an interior point method. We demonstrate
the benefits of this method on two optimization problems: Adversarial
generation for a classifier trained on MNIST images and security-constrained
optimal power flow with transient feasibility enforced using a neural network
surrogate.

TL;DR: 提出IIET（迭代隐式欧拉Transformer）来优化基于ODE的高阶Transformer架构，通过迭代隐式欧拉方法简化高阶方法，实现性能提升和模型压缩。同时引入IIAD蒸馏方法平衡性能-效率权衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高阶数值方法虽然提升Transformer在NLP和CV任务中的性能，但带来计算开销增加的性能-效率权衡问题。传统效率技术（如蒸馏）可能损害这些模型的性能。

Method: 1. 提出IIET，使用迭代隐式欧拉方法简化高阶方法；2. 引入IIAD蒸馏方法，通过灵活阈值平衡性能-效率权衡；3. 开发高效变体E-IIET。

Result: 在lm-evaluation-harness上：IIET比普通Transformer平均准确率提升2.65%，比PCformer提升0.8%；E-IIET推理开销减少55%，保留99.4%原始任务准确率；最高效IIET变体在可比速度下比普通Transformer性能提升超过1.6%。

Conclusion: IIET通过迭代隐式欧拉方法有效解决了高阶Transformer的性能-效率权衡问题，在保持高性能的同时显著提升推理效率，为ODE-based Transformer架构提供了更优的优化方案。

Abstract: High-order numerical methods enhance Transformer performance in tasks like
NLP and CV, but introduce a performance-efficiency trade-off due to increased
computational overhead. Our analysis reveals that conventional efficiency
techniques, such as distillation, can be detrimental to the performance of
these models, exemplified by PCformer. To explore more optimizable ODE-based
Transformer architectures, we propose the \textbf{I}terative \textbf{I}mplicit
\textbf{E}uler \textbf{T}ransformer \textbf{(IIET)}, which simplifies
high-order methods using an iterative implicit Euler approach. This
simplification not only leads to superior performance but also facilitates
model compression compared to PCformer. To enhance inference efficiency, we
introduce \textbf{I}teration \textbf{I}nfluence-\textbf{A}ware
\textbf{D}istillation \textbf{(IIAD)}. Through a flexible threshold, IIAD
allows users to effectively balance the performance-efficiency trade-off. On
lm-evaluation-harness, IIET boosts average accuracy by 2.65\% over vanilla
Transformers and 0.8\% over PCformer. Its efficient variant, E-IIET,
significantly cuts inference overhead by 55\% while retaining 99.4\% of the
original task accuracy. Moreover, the most efficient IIET variant achieves an
average performance gain exceeding 1.6\% over vanilla Transformer with
comparable speed.

TL;DR: C-FREE是一个无需对比学习的自监督预训练框架，通过整合2D分子图和3D构象集合来学习分子表示，在MoleculeNet上达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决分子表示学习中标记数据稀缺的问题，现有方法大多依赖手工增强或复杂生成目标，且主要使用2D拓扑信息，未能充分利用3D结构信息。

Method: 使用固定半径的ego-net作为建模单元，通过预测子图在潜在空间中与其互补邻域的嵌入来学习表示，结合2D图和3D构象，采用混合GNN-Transformer架构。

Result: 在GEOM数据集上预训练后，在MoleculeNet上超越对比学习、生成式和其他多模态自监督方法，达到最先进结果。

Conclusion: 3D信息增强的分子表示能有效迁移到新的化学领域，证明了3D结构信息在分子表示学习中的重要性。

Abstract: High-quality molecular representations are essential for property prediction
and molecular design, yet large labeled datasets remain scarce. While
self-supervised pretraining on molecular graphs has shown promise, many
existing approaches either depend on hand-crafted augmentations or complex
generative objectives, and often rely solely on 2D topology, leaving valuable
3D structural information underutilized. To address this gap, we introduce
C-FREE (Contrast-Free Representation learning on Ego-nets), a simple framework
that integrates 2D graphs with ensembles of 3D conformers. C-FREE learns
molecular representations by predicting subgraph embeddings from their
complementary neighborhoods in the latent space, using fixed-radius ego-nets as
modeling units across different conformers. This design allows us to integrate
both geometric and topological information within a hybrid Graph Neural Network
(GNN)-Transformer backbone, without negatives, positional encodings, or
expensive pre-processing. Pretraining on the GEOM dataset, which provides rich
3D conformational diversity, C-FREE achieves state-of-the-art results on
MoleculeNet, surpassing contrastive, generative, and other multimodal
self-supervised methods. Fine-tuning across datasets with diverse sizes and
molecule types further demonstrates that pretraining transfers effectively to
new chemical domains, highlighting the importance of 3D-informed molecular
representations.

Motivation: Koopman算子作为非线性动力系统的线性表示，结合再生核希尔伯特空间的概念，但在实际应用中面临计算复杂度高和传感器噪声敏感的问题。

Method: 采用高斯过程回归方法，通过减少计算需求并提高对传感器噪声的鲁棒性，同时优化超参数和字典学习以适应动力系统。

Conclusion: 该工作统一了高斯过程回归和动态模态分解，为基于核的Koopman算子方法提供了更高效和鲁棒的解决方案。

Abstract: The Koopman operator, as a linear representation of a nonlinear dynamical
system, has been attracting attention in many fields of science. Recently,
Koopman operator theory has been combined with another concept that is popular
in data science: reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces. We follow this thread into
Gaussian process methods, and illustrate how these methods can alleviate two
pervasive problems with kernel-based Koopman algorithms. The first being
sparsity: most kernel methods do not scale well and require an approximation to
become practical. We show that not only can the computational demands be
reduced, but also demonstrate improved resilience against sensor noise. The
second problem involves hyperparameter optimization and dictionary learning to
adapt the model to the dynamical system. In summary, the main contribution of
this work is the unification of Gaussian process regression and dynamic mode
decomposition.

Motivation: 大模型在敏感应用中需要能够遗忘特定知识（如用户请求、版权材料、过时信息），但现有方法存在训练不稳定和模型性能下降的问题

Method: 提出基于惩罚的双层优化框架，内层最大化步骤通过相似性感知惩罚强制遗忘，外层最小化步骤恢复模型效用，并开发了具有收敛保证的两环算法

Result: 在视觉和语言基准测试中，OFMU在遗忘效果和保留效用方面持续优于现有遗忘方法

Conclusion: OFMU框架通过分层结构有效解决了遗忘与保留目标之间的冲突，实现了更好的权衡

Abstract: Large language models deployed in sensitive applications increasingly require
the ability to unlearn specific knowledge, such as user requests, copyrighted
materials, or outdated information, without retraining from scratch to ensure
regulatory compliance, user privacy, and safety. This task, known as machine
unlearning, aims to remove the influence of targeted data (forgetting) while
maintaining performance on the remaining data (retention). A common approach is
to formulate this as a multi-objective problem and reduce it to a
single-objective problem via scalarization, where forgetting and retention
losses are combined using a weighted sum. However, this often results in
unstable training dynamics and degraded model utility due to conflicting
gradient directions. To address these challenges, we propose OFMU, a
penalty-based bi-level optimization framework that explicitly prioritizes
forgetting while preserving retention through a hierarchical structure. Our
method enforces forgetting via an inner maximization step that incorporates a
similarity-aware penalty to decorrelate the gradients of the forget and
retention objectives, and restores utility through an outer minimization step.
To ensure scalability, we develop a two-loop algorithm with provable
convergence guarantees under both convex and non-convex regimes. We further
provide a rigorous theoretical analysis of convergence rates and show that our
approach achieves better trade-offs between forgetting efficacy and model
utility compared to prior methods. Extensive experiments across vision and
language benchmarks demonstrate that OFMU consistently outperforms existing
unlearning methods in both forgetting efficacy and retained utility.

Abstract: We present a machine learning pipeline for biomarker discovery in Multiple
Sclerosis (MS), integrating eight publicly available microarray datasets from
Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells (PBMC). After robust preprocessing we
trained an XGBoost classifier optimized via Bayesian search. SHapley Additive
exPlanations (SHAP) were used to identify key features for model prediction,
indicating thus possible biomarkers. These were compared with genes identified
through classical Differential Expression Analysis (DEA). Our comparison
revealed both overlapping and unique biomarkers between SHAP and DEA,
suggesting complementary strengths. Enrichment analysis confirmed the
biological relevance of SHAP-selected genes, linking them to pathways such as
sphingolipid signaling, Th1/Th2/Th17 cell differentiation, and Epstein-Barr

value of combining explainable AI (xAI) with traditional statistical methods to
gain deeper insights into disease mechanism.

Result: 证明对偶乐观方法线性收敛到所有局部解，并为乐观超参数调优提供原则性指导。

Conclusion: 填补了对偶乐观方法经验成功与理论基础之间的关键空白。

Abstract: Constrained optimization is a powerful framework for enforcing requirements
on neural networks. These constrained deep learning problems are typically
solved using first-order methods on their min-max Lagrangian formulation, but
such approaches often suffer from oscillations and can fail to find all local
solutions. While the Augmented Lagrangian method (ALM) addresses these issues,
practitioners often favor dual optimistic ascent schemes (PI control) on the
standard Lagrangian, which perform well empirically but lack formal guarantees.
In this paper, we establish a previously unknown equivalence between these
approaches: dual optimistic ascent on the Lagrangian is equivalent to gradient
descent-ascent on the Augmented Lagrangian. This finding allows us to transfer
the robust theoretical guarantees of the ALM to the dual optimistic setting,
proving it converges linearly to all local solutions. Furthermore, the
equivalence provides principled guidance for tuning the optimism
hyper-parameter. Our work closes a critical gap between the empirical success
of dual optimistic methods and their theoretical foundation.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a promising decentralized learning
(DL) approach that enables the use of distributed data without compromising
user privacy. However, FL poses several key challenges. First, it is frequently
assumed that every client can train the same machine learning models, however,
not all clients are able to meet this assumption because of differences in
their business needs and computational resources. Second, statistical
heterogeneity (a.k.a. non-IID data) poses a major challenge in FL, which can
lead to lower global model performance. Third, while addressing these
challenges, there is a need for a cost-effective incentive mechanism to
encourage clients to participate in FL training. In response to these
challenges, we propose several methodologies: DL-SH, which facilitates
efficient, privacy-preserving, and communication-efficient learning in the
context of statistical heterogeneity; DL-MH, designed to manage fully
heterogeneous models while tackling statistical disparities; and I-DL-MH, an
incentive-based extension of DL-MH that promotes client engagement in federated
learning training by providing incentives within this complex federated
learning framework. Comprehensive experiments were carried out to assess the
performance and scalability of the proposed approaches across a range of
complex experimental settings. This involved utilizing various model
architectures, in diverse data distributions, including IID and several non-IID
scenarios, as well as multiple datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that
the proposed approaches significantly enhance accuracy and decrease
communication costs while effectively addressing statistical heterogeneity and
model heterogeneity in comparison to existing state-of-the-art approaches and
baselines, with DL-SH improving global model accuracy by 153%, and I-DL-MH
achieving a 225% improvement under non-IID conditions.

Conclusion: 联合建模是构建真实可控交互系统生成模型的关键，JointDiff框架成功统一了连续和离散过程的生成。

Abstract: Generative models often treat continuous data and discrete events as separate
processes, creating a gap in modeling complex systems where they interact
synchronously. To bridge this gap, we introduce JointDiff, a novel diffusion
framework designed to unify these two processes by simultaneously generating
continuous spatio-temporal data and synchronous discrete events. We demonstrate
its efficacy in the sports domain by simultaneously modeling multi-agent
trajectories and key possession events. This joint modeling is validated with
non-controllable generation and two novel controllable generation scenarios:
weak-possessor-guidance, which offers flexible semantic control over game
dynamics through a simple list of intended ball possessors, and text-guidance,
which enables fine-grained, language-driven generation. To enable the
conditioning with these guidance signals, we introduce CrossGuid, an effective
conditioning operation for multi-agent domains. We also share a new unified
sports benchmark enhanced with textual descriptions for soccer and football
datasets. JointDiff achieves state-of-the-art performance, demonstrating that
joint modeling is crucial for building realistic and controllable generative
models for interactive systems.

Motivation: 现有的大型EEG模型主要关注编码器架构，缺乏同等能力的解码器，限制了学习特征的充分利用。需要一种能够有效泛化到不同任务和数据集的新范式。

Method: ECHO将EEG建模重构为序列到序列学习，在序列空间中捕捉信号、标签和任务之间的层次关系，并整合离散支持样本构建上下文线索，实现上下文学习能力。

Result: 在多个数据集上的广泛实验表明，即使使用基本模型组件，ECHO在多任务设置中始终优于最先进的单任务LEM，展现出卓越的泛化能力和适应性。

Conclusion: ECHO通过解码器中心的序列到序列学习范式，成功解决了现有EEG模型解码能力不足的问题，实现了无需参数更新的动态任务适应和优越的跨任务泛化性能。

Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG), with its broad range of applications,
necessitates models that can generalize effectively across various tasks and
datasets. Large EEG Models (LEMs) address this by pretraining encoder-centric
architectures on large-scale unlabeled data to extract universal
representations. While effective, these models lack decoders of comparable
capacity, limiting the full utilization of the learned features. To address
this issue, we introduce ECHO, a novel decoder-centric LEM paradigm that
reformulates EEG modeling as sequence-to-sequence learning. ECHO captures
layered relationships among signals, labels, and tasks within sequence space,
while incorporating discrete support samples to construct contextual cues. This
design equips ECHO with in-context learning, enabling dynamic adaptation to
heterogeneous tasks without parameter updates. Extensive experiments across
multiple datasets demonstrate that, even with basic model components, ECHO
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art single-task LEMs in multi-task
settings, showing superior generalization and adaptability.

Motivation: 捆绑定价是一个经典的收益管理问题，但由于候选捆绑数量呈指数级增长，通常难以求解。本文探索使用GCN来解决这一棘手问题。

Method: 首先开发混合捆绑模型的图表示，然后训练GCN学习最优捆绑的潜在模式，提出两种推理策略来推导高质量可行解，并进一步使用局部搜索技术改进解的质量。

Result: 在5个产品的实例上训练的GCN，对于中小规模问题，仅用一小部分计算时间就能持续获得接近最优的解(优于97%)。对于更大规模问题，相比其他启发式方法如BSP，也能获得更优解。即使对于产品效用非加性的挑战性情况，也能为超过30个产品的实例提供高质量解。

Abstract: Bundle pricing refers to designing several product combinations (i.e.,
bundles) and determining their prices in order to maximize the expected profit.
It is a classic problem in revenue management and arises in many industries,
such as e-commerce, tourism, and video games. However, the problem is typically
intractable due to the exponential number of candidate bundles. In this paper,
we explore the usage of graph convolutional networks (GCNs) in solving the
bundle pricing problem. Specifically, we first develop a graph representation
of the mixed bundling model (where every possible bundle is assigned with a
specific price) and then train a GCN to learn the latent patterns of optimal
bundles. Based on the trained GCN, we propose two inference strategies to
derive high-quality feasible solutions. A local-search technique is further
proposed to improve the solution quality. Numerical experiments validate the
effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed GCN-based framework. Using a GCN
trained on instances with 5 products, our methods consistently achieve
near-optimal solutions (better than 97%) with only a fraction of computational
time for problems of small to medium size. It also achieves superior solutions
for larger size of problems compared with other heuristic methods such as
bundle size pricing (BSP). The method can also provide high quality solutions
for instances with more than 30 products even for the challenging cases where
product utilities are non-additive.

TL;DR: 本文研究发现激活函数选择是缓解持续学习中塑性损失的关键因素，提出了两种新的非线性激活函数（Smooth-Leaky和Randomized Smooth-Leaky），在监督学习和强化学习的持续学习场景中验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在持续学习中，模型不仅面临灾难性遗忘问题，还会逐渐丧失适应能力（塑性损失），而激活函数在这种失效模式中的作用尚未得到充分探索。

Method: 基于对负分支形状和饱和行为的属性分析，提出了两种即插即用的非线性激活函数，并在监督类增量基准和强化学习非平稳环境中进行评估，同时提供了简单的压力测试协议和诊断方法。

Result: 研究表明，精心设计的激活函数能够在持续学习中维持塑性，无需额外容量或任务特定调优，提供了一种轻量级、领域通用的解决方案。

Conclusion: 激活函数设计是缓解持续学习中塑性损失的有效方法，为持续学习系统提供了简单而强大的改进途径。

Abstract: In independent, identically distributed (i.i.d.) training regimes, activation
functions have been benchmarked extensively, and their differences often shrink
once model size and optimization are tuned. In continual learning, however, the
picture is different: beyond catastrophic forgetting, models can progressively
lose the ability to adapt (referred to as loss of plasticity) and the role of
the non-linearity in this failure mode remains underexplored. We show that
activation choice is a primary, architecture-agnostic lever for mitigating
plasticity loss. Building on a property-level analysis of negative-branch shape
and saturation behavior, we introduce two drop-in nonlinearities (Smooth-Leaky
and Randomized Smooth-Leaky) and evaluate them in two complementary settings:
(i) supervised class-incremental benchmarks and (ii) reinforcement learning
with non-stationary MuJoCo environments designed to induce controlled
distribution and dynamics shifts. We also provide a simple stress protocol and
diagnostics that link the shape of the activation to the adaptation under
change. The takeaway is straightforward: thoughtful activation design offers a
lightweight, domain-general way to sustain plasticity in continual learning
without extra capacity or task-specific tuning.

Motivation: 深度强化学习样本效率低，特别是在多任务设置中，这源于直接在冗余的高维参数空间中优化策略。

Abstract: Despite its recent successes, Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) is
notoriously sample-inefficient. We argue that this inefficiency stems from the
standard practice of optimizing policies directly in the high-dimensional and
highly redundant parameter space $\Theta$. This challenge is greatly compounded
in multi-task settings. In this work, we develop a novel, unsupervised approach
that compresses the policy parameter space $\Theta$ into a low-dimensional
latent space $\mathcal{Z}$. We train a generative model
$g:\mathcal{Z}\to\Theta$ by optimizing a behavioral reconstruction loss, which
ensures that the latent space is organized by functional similarity rather than
proximity in parameterization. We conjecture that the inherent dimensionality
of this manifold is a function of the environment's complexity, rather than the
size of the policy network. We validate our approach in continuous control
domains, showing that the parameterization of standard policy networks can be
compressed up to five orders of magnitude while retaining most of its
expressivity. As a byproduct, we show that the learned manifold enables
task-specific adaptation via Policy Gradient operating in the latent space
$\mathcal{Z}$.

Abstract: The northeastern region of the Czech Republic is among the most seismically
active areas in the country. The most frequent seismic events are
mining-induced since there used to be strong mining activity in the past.
However, natural tectonic events may also occur. In addition, seismic stations
often record explosions in quarries in the region. Despite the cessation of
mining activities, mine-induced seismic events still occur. Therefore, a rapid
differentiation between tectonic and anthropogenic events is still important.
  The region is currently monitored by the OKC seismic station in
Ostrava-Kr\'{a}sn\'{e} Pole built in 1983 which is a part of the Czech Regional
Seismic Network. The station has been providing digital continuous waveform
data at 100 Hz since 2007. In the years 1992--2002, the region was co-monitored
by the Seismic Polygon Fren\v{s}t\'{a}t (SPF) which consisted of five seismic
stations using a triggered STA/LTA system.
  In this study, we apply and compare machine learning methods to the SPF
dataset, which contains labeled records of tectonic and mining-induced events.
For binary classification, a Long Short-Term Memory recurrent neural network
and XGBoost achieved an F1-score of 0.94 -- 0.95, demonstrating the potential
of modern machine learning techniques for rapid event characterization.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多回合稀疏奖励环境中，完成单个任务需要30+回合交互，这对强化学习构成了根本性挑战。作者发现了一个独特的失败模式：探索-利用级联失败，包括早期策略过早收敛和晚期策略崩溃。

Method: 提出EPO框架，包含三个协同机制：(1)在多回合设置中采用熵正则化增强探索；(2)熵平滑正则化器，将策略熵限制在历史平均值内以防止突变；(3)自适应基于阶段的加权，在训练过程中平衡探索和利用。

Result: EPO在ScienceWorld上实现了高达152%的性能提升，在ALFWorld上实现了19.8%的性能提升。分析表明EPO能保证熵方差的单调递减同时维持收敛性。

Conclusion: 多回合稀疏奖励设置需要与传统RL根本不同的熵控制方法，这对LLM智能体训练具有广泛意义。

Abstract: Training LLM agents in multi-turn environments with sparse rewards, where
completing a single task requires 30+ turns of interaction within an episode,
presents a fundamental challenge for reinforcement learning. We identify a
critical failure mode unique to this setting: the exploration-exploitation
cascade failure. This cascade begins with early-stage policy premature
convergence, where sparse feedback causes agents to commit to flawed,
low-entropy strategies. Subsequently, agents enter late-stage policy collapse,
where conventional entropy regularization becomes counterproductive, promoting
chaotic exploration that destabilizes training. We propose Entropy-regularized
Policy Optimization (EPO), a general framework that breaks this failure cycle
through three synergistic mechanisms: (1) adopting entropy regularization in
multi-turn settings to enhance exploration, (2) an entropy smoothing
regularizer that bounds policy entropy within historical averages to prevent
abrupt fluctuations, and (3) adaptive phase-based weighting that balances
exploration and exploitation across training. Our analysis justifies that EPO
guarantees monotonically decreasing entropy variance while maintaining
convergence. EPO achieves up to 152% performance improvement on ScienceWorld
and up to 19.8% on ALFWorld. Our work demonstrates that multi-turn
sparse-reward settings require fundamentally different entropy control than
traditional RL, with broad implications for LLM agent training.

TL;DR: 本文提出EDGE评估协议，通过识别极端类别序列来更准确地评估类增量学习的性能分布，解决传统采样方法低估真实方差的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统类增量学习评估仅从少量随机序列计算均值和方差，无法捕捉完整性能范围，导致均值估计偏差和方差严重低估。

Method: 提出EDGE协议，利用任务间相似性与模型性能的正相关性，自适应识别和采样极端类别序列，更接近真实性能分布。

Result: 实验表明EDGE能有效捕捉性能极值，提供更准确的分布边界估计，为模型选择和鲁棒性检查提供可行见解。

Conclusion: EDGE通过极端序列评估提供了更可靠的类增量学习评估框架，能更准确地表征性能分布特征。

Abstract: Class Incremental Learning (CIL) requires models to continuously learn new
classes without forgetting previously learned ones, while maintaining stable
performance across all possible class sequences. In real-world settings, the
order in which classes arrive is diverse and unpredictable, and model
performance can vary substantially across different sequences. Yet mainstream
evaluation protocols calculate mean and variance from only a small set of
randomly sampled sequences. Our theoretical analysis and empirical results
demonstrate that this sampling strategy fails to capture the full performance
range, resulting in biased mean estimates and a severe underestimation of the
true variance in the performance distribution. We therefore contend that a
robust CIL evaluation protocol should accurately characterize and estimate the
entire performance distribution. To this end, we introduce the concept of
extreme sequences and provide theoretical justification for their crucial role
in the reliable evaluation of CIL. Moreover, we observe a consistent positive
correlation between inter-task similarity and model performance, a relation
that can be leveraged to guide the search for extreme sequences. Building on
these insights, we propose EDGE (Extreme case-based Distribution and
Generalization Evaluation), an evaluation protocol that adaptively identifies
and samples extreme class sequences using inter-task similarity, offering a
closer approximation of the ground-truth performance distribution. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that EDGE effectively captures performance extremes and
yields more accurate estimates of distributional boundaries, providing
actionable insights for model selection and robustness checking. Our code is

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种结合最优传输采样策略的Mean Flow框架，能够在单步生成中更好地保持原始多步流匹配过程的保真度和多样性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的Mean Flow方法虽然能实现单步快速生成，但在许多连续域中无法准确近似原始多步流匹配过程的行为，导致生成质量下降。

Method: 将最优传输采样策略整合到Mean Flow框架中，改进单步生成器的性能。

Result: 在低维控制设置和高维任务（如图像生成、图像到图像转换、点云生成）上的实验表明，该方法在单步生成建模中实现了更优的推理精度。

Conclusion: 提出的方法能够有效解决Mean Flow在连续域中的近似问题，在保持快速推理的同时显著提升生成质量。

Abstract: Flow-matching generative models have emerged as a powerful paradigm for
continuous data generation, achieving state-of-the-art results across domains
such as images, 3D shapes, and point clouds. Despite their success, these
models suffer from slow inference due to the requirement of numerous sequential
sampling steps. Recent work has sought to accelerate inference by reducing the
number of sampling steps. In particular, Mean Flows offer a one-step generation
approach that delivers substantial speedups while retaining strong generative
performance. Yet, in many continuous domains, Mean Flows fail to faithfully
approximate the behavior of the original multi-step flow-matching process. In
this work, we address this limitation by incorporating optimal transport-based
sampling strategies into the Mean Flow framework, enabling one-step generators
that better preserve the fidelity and diversity of the original multi-step flow
process. Experiments on controlled low-dimensional settings and on
high-dimensional tasks such as image generation, image-to-image translation,
and point cloud generation demonstrate that our approach achieves superior
inference accuracy in one-step generative modeling.

Conclusion: SPEAR通过渐进式探索-利用平衡和自模仿学习，有效解决了强化学习训练中的稳定性问题，为智能代理训练提供了新思路。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) is the dominant paradigm for sharpening strategic
tool use capabilities of LLMs on long-horizon, sparsely-rewarded agent tasks,
yet it faces a fundamental challenge of exploration-exploitation trade-off.
Existing studies stimulate exploration through the lens of policy entropy, but
such mechanical entropy maximization is prone to RL training instability due to
the multi-turn distribution shifting. In this paper, we target the progressive
exploration-exploitation balance under the guidance of the agent own
experiences without succumbing to either entropy collapsing or runaway
divergence. We propose SPEAR, a curriculum-based self-imitation learning (SIL)
recipe for training agentic LLMs. It extends the vanilla SIL framework, where a
replay buffer stores self-generated promising trajectories for off-policy
update, by gradually steering the policy evolution within a well-balanced range
of entropy across stages. Specifically, our approach incorporates a curriculum
to manage the exploration process, utilizing intrinsic rewards to foster
skill-level exploration and facilitating action-level exploration through SIL.
At first, the auxiliary tool call reward plays a critical role in the
accumulation of tool-use skills, enabling broad exposure to the unfamiliar
distributions of the environment feedback with an upward entropy trend. As
training progresses, self-imitation gets strengthened to exploit existing
successful patterns from replayed experiences for comparative action-level
exploration, accelerating solution iteration without unbounded entropy growth.
To further stabilize training, we recalibrate the advantages of experiences in
the replay buffer to address the potential policy drift. Reugularizations such
as the clipping of tokens with high covariance between probability and
advantage are introduced to the trajectory-level entropy control to curb
over-confidence.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了Quantile Advantage Estimation (QAE)方法，通过使用分位数基线替代均值基线，解决了强化学习中熵崩溃和熵爆炸的问题，实现了稳定的训练和性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于均值基线的强化学习方法在面对奖励异常值时，会不当惩罚负优势样本，导致训练在熵崩溃和熵爆炸之间振荡。

Method: 提出QAE方法，用分组K-分位数基线替代均值基线，在困难查询中强化罕见成功，在简单查询中针对剩余失败，通过一阶softmax更新实现双向熵安全。

Result: QAE稳定了熵值，稀疏化了信用分配（约80%响应获得零优势），在Qwen3-8B/14B-Base模型上持续提升了AIME 2024/2025和AMC 2023的pass@1分数。

Conclusion: 基线设计而非token级启发式是扩展RLVR的主要机制，QAE为强化学习提供了更稳定的训练框架。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) strengthens LLM
reasoning, but training often oscillates between {entropy collapse} and
{entropy explosion}. We trace both hazards to the mean baseline used in
value-free RL (e.g., GRPO and DAPO), which improperly penalizes
negative-advantage samples under reward outliers. We propose {Quantile
Advantage Estimation} (QAE), replacing the mean with a group-wise K-quantile
baseline. QAE induces a response-level, two-regime gate: on hard queries (p <=
1 - K) it reinforces rare successes, while on easy queries (p > 1 - K) it
targets remaining failures. Under first-order softmax updates, we prove
{two-sided entropy safety}, giving lower and upper bounds on one-step entropy
change that curb explosion and prevent collapse. Empirically, this minimal
modification stabilizes entropy, sparsifies credit assignment (with tuned K,
roughly 80% of responses receive zero advantage), and yields sustained pass@1
gains on Qwen3-8B/14B-Base across AIME 2024/2025 and AMC 2023. These results
identify {baseline design} -- rather than token-level heuristics -- as the
primary mechanism for scaling RLVR.

Motivation: ICL在数据稀缺场景下比SFT具有更好的泛化能力和校准响应，但推理计算成本更高。研究能否利用ICL的内部计算来改进SFT的质量。

Method: 提出ICL激活对齐(IA2)自蒸馏技术，旨在在SFT模型中复制ICL的激活模式，激励类似ICL的内部推理过程。

Result: 在12个流行基准测试和2个模型家族上的广泛实证结果表明，在SFT之前执行IA2显著提高了模型输出的准确性和校准性。

Conclusion: 该方法不仅具有实际应用价值，还为理解模型适应的内部机制提供了概念窗口。

Abstract: Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) is used to specialize model behavior by training
weights to produce intended target responses for queries. In contrast,
In-Context Learning (ICL) adapts models during inference with instructions or
demonstrations in the prompt. ICL can offer better generalizability and more
calibrated responses compared to SFT in data scarce settings, at the cost of
more inference compute. In this work, we ask the question: Can ICL's internal
computations be used to improve the qualities of SFT? We first show that ICL
and SFT produce distinct activation patterns, indicating that the two methods
achieve adaptation through different functional mechanisms. Motivated by this
observation and to use ICL's rich functionality, we introduce ICL Activation
Alignment (IA2), a self-distillation technique which aims to replicate ICL's
activation patterns in SFT models and incentivizes ICL-like internal reasoning.
Performing IA2 as a priming step before SFT significantly improves the accuracy
and calibration of model outputs, as shown by our extensive empirical results
on 12 popular benchmarks and 2 model families. This finding is not only
practically useful, but also offers a conceptual window into the inner
mechanics of model adaptation.

Motivation: DFM是一个有前景的离散生成建模框架，通过训练神经网络来近似变换速度场来学习底层生成动态。本文旨在为DFM的端到端训练提供理论保证。

Method: 通过分解最终分布估计误差来建立保证链：首先证明生成分布与目标分布之间的总变差距离由学习速度场的风险控制，然后通过分析两个主要误差源来界定该风险：(i)近似误差，量化Transformer架构表示真实速度的能力；(ii)估计误差，推导在有限数据集上训练的统计收敛率。

Conclusion: 该研究为DFM生成模型的端到端训练提供了坚实的理论基础，证明了其分布收敛的数学保证。

Abstract: We provide a theoretical analysis for end-to-end training Discrete Flow
Matching (DFM) generative models. DFM is a promising discrete generative
modeling framework that learns the underlying generative dynamics by training a
neural network to approximate the transformative velocity field. Our analysis
establishes a clear chain of guarantees by decomposing the final distribution
estimation error. We first prove that the total variation distance between the
generated and target distributions is controlled by the risk of the learned
velocity field. We then bound this risk by analyzing its two primary sources:
(i) Approximation Error, where we quantify the capacity of the Transformer
architecture to represent the true velocity, and (ii) Estimation Error, where
we derive statistical convergence rates that bound the error from training on a
finite dataset. By composing these results, we provide the first formal proof
that the distribution generated by a trained DFM model provably converges to
the true data distribution as the training set size increases.

Abstract: Heuristic functions are central to the performance of search algorithms such
as A-star, where admissibility - the property of never overestimating the true
shortest-path cost - guarantees solution optimality. Recent deep learning
approaches often disregard admissibility and provide limited guarantees on
generalization beyond the training data. This paper addresses both of these
limitations. First, we pose heuristic learning as a constrained optimization
problem and introduce Cross-Entropy Admissibility (CEA), a loss function that
enforces admissibility during training. On the Rubik's Cube domain, this method
yields near-admissible heuristics with significantly stronger guidance than
compressed pattern database (PDB) heuristics. Theoretically, we study the
sample complexity of learning heuristics. By leveraging PDB abstractions and
the structural properties of graphs such as the Rubik's Cube, we tighten the
bound on the number of training samples needed for A-star to generalize.
Replacing a general hypothesis class with a ReLU neural network gives bounds
that depend primarily on the network's width and depth, rather than on graph
size. Using the same network, we also provide the first generalization
guarantees for goal-dependent heuristics.

Abstract: Current biocomputing approaches predominantly rely on engineered circuits
with fixed logic, offering limited stability and reliability under diverse
environmental conditions. Here, we use the GRNN framework introduced in our
previous work to transform bacterial gene expression dynamics into a
biocomputing library of mathematical solvers. We introduce a sub-GRNN search
algorithm that identifies functional subnetworks tailored to specific
mathematical calculation and classification tasks by evaluating gene expression
patterns across chemically encoded input conditions. Tasks include identifying
Fibonacci numbers, prime numbers, multiplication, and Collatz step counts. The
identified problem-specific sub-GRNNs are then assessed using gene-wise and
collective perturbation, as well as Lyapunov-based stability analysis, to
evaluate robustness and reliability. Our results demonstrate that native
transcriptional machinery can be harnessed to perform diverse mathematical
calculation and classification tasks, while maintaining computing stability and
reliability.
