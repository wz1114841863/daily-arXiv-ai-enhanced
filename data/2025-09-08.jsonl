Map conflation\nis the process of augmentation of a GDB using another GDB to conflate missing\nspatial features.

NSF has two core\nprinciples: treating the optimizer as a spectral controller that dynamically\nbalances low- and high-frequency information; and periodically reweighting\nfrequency bands at negligible cost, without modifying the model, data, or\ntraining pipeline. We realize NSF via a p-exponent extension of the\nsecond-moment term, enabling both positive and negative exponents, and\nimplement it through cyclic scheduling. Theory and experiments show that\nadaptive methods emphasize low frequencies, SGD is near-neutral, and negative\nexponents amplify high-frequency information.

Conversely, TTA can perform\nmore stably with batch-agnostic norm layers, i.e., group or layer norm.\nHowever, we observe that TTA with group and layer norms does not always succeed\nand still suffers many failure cases, i.e., the model collapses into trivial\nsolutions by assigning the same class label for all samples. By digging into\nthis, we find that, during the collapse process: 1) the model gradients often\nundergo an initial explosion followed by rapid degradation, suggesting that\ncertain noisy test samples with large gradients may disrupt adaptation; and 2)\nthe model representations tend to exhibit high correlations and classification\nbias. To address this, we first propose a sharpness-aware and reliable entropy\nminimization method, called SAR, for stabilizing TTA from two aspects: 1)\nremove partial noisy samples with large gradients, 2) encourage model weights\nto go to a flat minimum so that the model is robust to the remaining noisy\nsamples. Based on SAR, we further introduce SAR^2 to prevent representation\ncollapse with two regularizers: 1) a redundancy regularizer to reduce\ninter-dimensional correlations among centroid-invariant features; and 2) an\ninequity regularizer to maximize the prediction entropy of a prototype\ncentroid, thereby penalizing biased representations toward any specific class.\nPromising results demonstrate that our methods perform more stably over prior\nmethods and are computationally efficient under the above wild test scenarios."}

When\nbenchmarked on CASIA 2.0 dataset, our method achieves an accuracy of 77.9%,\noutperforming traditional statistical methods. Despite its relatively weaker\nperformance compared to larger, more complex forgery detection pipelines, our\napproach balances computational complexity and detection reliability, making it\nready for practical deployment. It provides a strong methodology for forensic\nscrutiny of digital images. In a broader sense, it advances the state of the\nart in visual forensics, addressing an urgent requirement in media\nverification, law enforcement and digital content reliability."}

Among existing methods, the Alternating Direction Method\nof Multipliers (ADMM) has gained popularity due to its strong convergence\nguarantees and suitability for decentralized computation. However, ADMM often\nsuffers from slow convergence and sensitivity to hyperparameter choices. In\nthis work, we show that distributed ADMM iterations can be naturally\nrepresented within the message-passing framework of graph neural networks\n(GNNs). Building on this connection, we propose to learn adaptive step sizes\nand communication weights by a graph neural network that predicts the\nhyperparameters based on the iterates. By unrolling ADMM for a fixed number of\niterations, we train the network parameters end-to-end to minimize the final\niterates error for a given problem class, while preserving the algorithm's\nconvergence properties. Numerical experiments demonstrate that our learned\nvariant consistently improves convergence speed and solution quality compared\nto standard ADMM.

Traditional\nmanual tuning, while offering simplicity and interpretability, often yields\nsuboptimal results due to its unprincipled tuning objectives, the vast amount\nof parameter combinations, and its lack of personalization and adaptability to\nseasonality. In this work, we propose a general Deep Reinforcement Learning\nframework for Personalized Utility Tuning (DRL-PUT) to address the challenges\nof multi-objective optimization within ad recommender systems. Our key\ncontributions include: 1) Formulating the problem as a reinforcement learning\ntask: given the state of an ad request, we predict the optimal hyperparameters\nto maximize a pre-defined reward. 2) Developing an approach to directly learn\nan optimal policy model using online serving logs, avoiding the need to\nestimate a value function, which is inherently challenging due to the high\nvariance and unbalanced distribution of immediate rewards. We evaluated DRL-PUT\nthrough an online A/B experiment in Pinterest's ad recommender system. Compared\nto the baseline manual utility tuning approach, DRL-PUT improved the\nclick-through rate by 9.7% and the long click-through rate by 7.7% on the\ntreated segment. We conducted a detailed ablation study on the impact of\ndifferent reward definitions and analyzed the personalization aspect of the\nlearned policy model."}
