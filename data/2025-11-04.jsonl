In hydrological modeling, the\nincreasing demand for high-resolution, real-time simulations has led to the\nadoption of GPU-accelerated platforms and performance portable programming\nframeworks such as Kokkos. In this work, we present a comprehensive performance\nstudy of the SERGHEI-SWE solver, a shallow water equations code, across four\nstate-of-the-art heterogeneous HPC systems: Frontier (AMD MI250X), JUWELS\nBooster (NVIDIA A100), JEDI (NVIDIA H100), and Aurora (Intel Max 1550). We\nassess strong scaling up to 1024 GPUs and weak scaling upwards of 2048 GPUs,\ndemonstrating consistent scalability with a speedup of 32 and an efficiency\nupwards of 90\\% for most almost all the test range. Roofline analysis reveals\nthat memory bandwidth is the dominant performance bottleneck, with key solver\nkernels residing in the memory-bound region. To evaluate performance\nportability, we apply both harmonic and arithmetic mean-based metrics while\nvarying problem size.

Constrained to read margins, QLC always suffers from lateral charge\nmigration (LCM), which caused by non-uniform charge density across adjacent\nmemory cells. To suppress charge density gap between cells, there are some\nalgorithm in form of intra-page data mapping such as WBVM, DVDS. However, we\nobserve inter-page data arrangements also approach the suppression. Thus, we\nproposed an intelligent model PDA-LSTM to arrange intra-page data for LCM\nsuppression, which is a physics-knowledge-driven neural network model.

However, the transferability of adversarial attacks faces a\nfundamental dilemma between Exploitation (maximizing attack potency) and\nExploration (enhancing cross-model generalization). Traditional momentum-based\nmethods over-prioritize Exploitation, i.e., higher loss maxima for attack\npotency but weakened generalization (narrow loss surface). Conversely, recent\nmethods with inner-iteration sampling over-prioritize Exploration, i.e.,\nflatter loss surfaces for cross-model generalization but weakened attack\npotency (suboptimal local maxima). To resolve this dilemma, we propose a simple\nyet effective Gradient-Guided Sampling (GGS), which harmonizes both objectives\nthrough guiding sampling along the gradient ascent direction to improve both\nsampling efficiency and stability. Specifically, based on MI-FGSM, GGS\nintroduces inner-iteration random sampling and guides the sampling direction\nusing the gradient from the previous inner-iteration (the sampling's magnitude\nis determined by a random distribution). This mechanism encourages adversarial\nexamples to reside in balanced regions with both flatness for cross-model\ngeneralization and higher local maxima for strong attack potency. Comprehensive\nexperiments across multiple DNN architectures and multimodal large language\nmodels (MLLMs) demonstrate the superiority of our method over state-of-the-art\ntransfer attacks.

Motivated by this, we develop a unifying, predictive account\nof LLM control from a Bayesian perspective.

This results in\na closed-form Bayesian model that is highly predictive of LLM behavior across\ncontext- and activation-based interventions in a set of domains inspired by\nprior work on many-shot in-context learning.

We prove that an\nunnormalized DNN can exhibit exponentially large Lipschitz constants with\nrespect to either its parameters or inputs, implying excessive functional\ncapacity and potential overfitting. Such bad DNNs are uncountably many. In\ncontrast, the insertion of normalization layers provably can reduce the\nLipschitz constant at an exponential rate in the number of normalization\noperations.

We argue\nthat LLM development should be fundamentally reoriented toward\ncapability-per-resource rather than capability alone. We present a theoretical\nframework demonstrating that resource-allocation decisions guided by gradient\ninfluence patterns can dramatically improve efficiency throughout the AI\nlifecycle. Our analysis shows that in transformer-based models, where a small\nfraction of parameters exert outsized influence (following heavy-tailed\ndistributions), three critical insights emerge: (1) updating only\nhigh-influence parameters strictly outperforms full-parameter tuning on a\nperformance-per-resource basis; (2) simple gradient norms provide\ncomputationally efficient proxies for identifying these high-influence\ncomponents; and (3) coordinated parameter and data selection yields\nmultiplicative efficiency gains, potentially reducing resource requirements by\norders of magnitude. Building on these theoretical foundations, we propose a\ntwo stage paradigm marginal-return pretraining for foundation developers and\ninfluence guided adaptation for downstream users bridged by gradient\nblueprints, metadata describing which parameters matter most for various tasks.\nThis capability-per-resource perspective transforms what were once considered\npragmatic hardware workarounds into theoretically optimal strategies,\ndemocratizing access to cutting-edge AI capabilities while significantly\nreducing environmental impact.

Together, these steps produce a compact set of\nenergy-sensitive indicators with both statistical robustness and physical\nsignificance, resulting in impact energy predictions that remain interpretable\nand traceable to measurable structural responses. Using this optimised input\nspace, a fully-connected neural network is trained and validated with\nexperimental data from multiple impact scenarios, including pristine and\ndamaged states. The resulting model demonstrates significantly improved impact\nenergy prediction accuracy, reducing errors by a factor of three compared to\nconventional time-series techniques and purely data-driven models."}

While multi-task learning\ncan mitigate forgetting, it requires simultaneous access to all datasets and\nimposes computational overhead that scales linearly with the number of tasks.\nIn this work, we introduce a routing-based approach that enables the\nintegration of new tasks while preserving the foundational knowledge acquired\nduring pretraining. We evaluate our method using InternVL-2 models (2B and 8B\nparameters) and demonstrate that routing preserves the model's foundational\ncapabilities by maintaining performance on general-purpose benchmarks such as\nChartQA, MMBench, and DocVQA, while simultaneously improving accuracy on\nspecialized tasks. Importantly, our approach achieves this without requiring\nconcurrent access to data from all tasks, avoiding the significant\ncomputational and data overhead associated with traditional multi-task\nlearning. We further conduct extensive ablation studies to evaluate the\nscalability and robustness of routing-based learning, showing that the approach\nis resilient to a growing number of tasks and performs particularly well when\nnew tasks are semantically related. Finally, we show that the routing mechanism\nenables superior cross-modal transfer between language and vision capabilities,\nallowing knowledge learned in one modality to enhance performance in another\ncapability not achieved by existing continual learning methods."}

While existing feature extraction methods aim to\nidentify concepts that are independent directions, it is unclear if this\nassumption can capture the rich temporal structure of language. Specifically,\nvia a Bayesian lens, we demonstrate that Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) impose\npriors that assume independence of concepts across time, implying stationarity.\nMeanwhile, language model representations exhibit rich temporal dynamics,\nincluding systematic growth in conceptual dimensionality, context-dependent\ncorrelations, and pronounced non-stationarity, in direct conflict with the\npriors of SAEs. Taking inspiration from computational neuroscience, we\nintroduce a new interpretability objective -- Temporal Feature Analysis --\nwhich possesses a temporal inductive bias to decompose representations at a\ngiven time into two parts: a predictable component, which can be inferred from\nthe context, and a residual component, which captures novel information\nunexplained by the context. Temporal Feature Analyzers correctly parse garden\npath sentences, identify event boundaries, and more broadly delineate abstract,\nslow-moving information from novel, fast-moving information, while existing\nSAEs show significant pitfalls in all the above tasks.

Yet,\nprediction alone offers limited insight into the governing physical processes.\nTo bridge this gap, we integrated explainable machine learning (ML) with\nsymbolic modeling to uncover the drivers of RWT dynamics across ten reservoirs\nin the Red River Basin, USA, using over 10,000 depth-resolved temperature\nprofiles. We first employed ensemble and neural models, including Random Forest\n(RF), Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), and Multilayer Perceptron (MLP),\nachieving high predictive skill (best RMSE = 1.20 degree Celsius, R^2 = 0.97).\nUsing SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations), we quantified the contribution of\nphysical drivers such as air temperature, depth, wind, and lake volume,\nrevealing consistent patterns across reservoirs. To translate these data-driven\ninsights into compact analytical expressions, we developed Kolmogorov Arnold\nNetworks (KANs) to symbolically approximate RWT. Ten progressively complex KAN\nequations were derived, improving from R^2 = 0.84 using a single predictor\n(7-day antecedent air temperature) to R^2 = 0.92 with ten predictors, though\ngains diminished beyond five, highlighting a balance between simplicity and\naccuracy. The resulting equations, dominated by linear and rational forms,\nincrementally captured nonlinear behavior while preserving interpretability.\nDepth consistently emerged as a secondary but critical predictor, whereas\nprecipitation had limited effect. By coupling predictive accuracy with\nexplanatory power, this framework demonstrates how KANs and explainable ML can\ntransform black-box models into transparent surrogates that advance both\nprediction and understanding of reservoir thermal dynamics."}

QLC 3D NAND flash\nstores 4 bit per cell to expand the storage density, resulting in narrower read\nmargins. Constrained to read margins, QLC always suffers from lateral charge\nmigration (LCM), which caused by non-uniform charge density across adjacent\nmemory cells. To suppress charge density gap between cells, there are some\nalgorithm in form of intra-page data mapping such as WBVM, DVDS. However, we\nobserve inter-page data arrangements also approach the suppression. Thus, we\nproposed an intelligent model PDA-LSTM to arrange intra-page data for LCM\nsuppression, which is a physics-knowledge-driven neural network model. PDA-LSTM\napplies a long-short term memory (LSTM) neural network to compute a data\narrangement probability matrix from input page data pattern. The arrangement is\nto minimize the global impacts derived from the LCM among wordlines. Since each\npage data can be arranged only once, we design a transformation from output\nmatrix of LSTM network to non-repetitive sequence generation probability matrix\nto assist training process. The arranged data pattern can decrease the bit\nerror rate (BER) during data retention. In addition, PDA-LSTM do not need extra\nflag bits to record data transport of 3D NAND flash compared with WBVM, DVDS.\nThe experiment results show that the PDA-LSTM reduces the average BER by 80.4%\ncompared with strategy without data arrangement, and by 18.4%, 15.2% compared\nrespectively with WBVM and DVDS with code-length 64."}

One promising but challenging\napproach is to deploy such a computational workflow over heterogeneous GPUs.\nUnlike conventional large-scale LLM pretraining, RL training generally\ndecomposes into three coupled stages, i.e., rollout generation, reward\ncomputation, and policy/value updates, which exhibit markedly different compute\nintensities, memory footprints, and communication patterns. Recent research\nshows that fully asynchronous RL training can disaggregate these stages across\ndisjoint hardware pools without sacrificing training stability, creating a\ngreat opportunity for real-world heterogeneous deployment. To this end, we\npresent AReaL-Hex, a heterogeneity-aware asynchronous RL training system that\neffectively schedules how to execute rollout generation and policy model\ntraining over heterogeneous GPUs while enforcing data staleness bounds.\nConcretely, we use a two-phase scheduler: (i) a constrained search with MILP to\nselect per-stage parallelization strategies and workload assignments given a\nresource budget, and (ii) a graph-partitioning step that allocates\nheterogeneous GPUs and interconnects to maximize end-to-end throughput. Built\natop a fully asynchronous RL architecture, AReaL-Hex maps HBM-I/O-bound\ngeneration and compute-bound optimization to more cost-efficient resources and\nbalances their producer-consumer interactions to avoid both idleness and stale\nrollout trajectories. On the mathematical reasoning task with various model\nscales (1.5B, 7B, and 14B), compared to homogeneous deployments of\nstate-of-the-art asynchronous RL systems: (i) When maintaining the same total\nbudgets, AReaL-Hex delivers up to 1.50x higher training throughput; (ii) When\nachieving the same training throughput, AReaL-Hex results in up to 1.46x\nreduction in training cost."}
