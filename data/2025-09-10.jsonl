Further, optimistic\nconcurrency control and deferred validation in Fabric may lead to resource\ninefficiencies and contention, as conflicting transactions are identified only\nduring the commit phase. To address these challenges, we propose a\ndependency-aware execution model for Hyperledger Fabric. Our approach includes:\n(a) a dependency flagging system during endorsement, marking transactions as\nindependent or dependent using a hashmap; (b) an optimized block construction\nin the ordering service that prioritizes independent transactions; (c) the\nincorporation of a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) within each block to represent\ndependencies; and (d) parallel execution of independent transactions at the\ncommitter, with dependent transactions processed according to DAG order.\nIncorporated in Hyperledger Fabric v2.5, our framework was tested on workloads\nwith varying dependency levels and system loads. Results show up to 40% higher\nthroughput and significantly reduced rejection rates in high-contention\nscenarios. This demonstrates that dependency-aware scheduling and DAG-based\nexecution can substantially enhance Fabric's scalability while remaining\ncompatible with its existing consensus and smart contract layers."}

In this work, to trade off predictability and\nnon-stationarity, a new approach for multi-step ATP, named non-stationary ATP (\nNSATP), is proposed.

While numerous studies have explored\nrebalancing techniques to address this issue, less attention has been given to\nevaluating the performance of binary classifiers under imbalance when no such\ntechniques are applied. Therefore, the goal of this study is to assess the\nperformance of binary classifiers \"as-is\", without performing any explicit\nrebalancing. Specifically, we systematically evaluate the robustness of a\ndiverse set of binary classifiers across both real-world and synthetic\ndatasets, under progressively reduced minority class sizes, using one-shot and\nfew-shot scenarios as baselines. Our approach also explores varying data\ncomplexities through synthetic decision boundary generation to simulate\nreal-world conditions. In addition to standard classifiers, we include\nexperiments using undersampling, oversampling strategies, and one-class\nclassification (OCC) methods to examine their behavior under severe imbalance.\nThe results confirm that classification becomes more difficult as data\ncomplexity increases and the minority class size decreases. While traditional\nclassifiers deteriorate under extreme imbalance, advanced models like TabPFN\nand boosting-based ensembles retain relatively higher performance and better\ngeneralization compared to traditional classifiers.
