Drawing inspiration from the success of the reinforcement learning\nstage in fine-tuning large language models, we propose a two-stage\npost-training approach for robotics. The first stage, Supervised Fine-Tuning\n(SFT), fine-tunes pretrained foundation models using both: a) behavioral\ncloning, and b) steps-to-go prediction objectives. In the second stage,\nSelf-Improvement, steps-to-go prediction enables the extraction of a\nwell-shaped reward function and a robust success detector, enabling a fleet of\nrobots to autonomously practice downstream tasks with minimal human\nsupervision. Through extensive experiments on real-world and simulated robot\nembodiments, our novel post-training recipe unveils significant results on\nEmbodied Foundation Models. First, we demonstrate that the combination of SFT\nand Self-Improvement is significantly more sample-efficient than scaling\nimitation data collection for supervised learning, and that it leads to\npolicies with significantly higher success rates. Further ablations highlight\nthat the combination of web-scale pretraining and Self-Improvement is the key\nto this sample-efficiency. Next, we demonstrate that our proposed combination\nuniquely unlocks a capability that current methods cannot achieve: autonomously\npracticing and acquiring novel skills that generalize far beyond the behaviors\nobserved in the imitation learning datasets used during training. These\nfindings highlight the transformative potential of combining pretrained\nfoundation models with online Self-Improvement to enable autonomous skill\nacquisition in robotics.

Several\nrecent studies indicate that adapting precision levels across different\nparameters can maintain accuracy comparable to full-precision models while\nsignificantly reducing computational demands. However, existing embedded\nmicroprocessors lack sufficient architectural support for efficiently executing\nmixed-precision NNs, both in terms of ISA extensions and hardware design,\nresulting in inefficiencies such as excessive data packing/unpacking and\nunderutilized arithmetic units. In this work, we propose novel ISA extensions\nand a micro-architecture implementation specifically designed to optimize\nmixed-precision execution, enabling energy-efficient deep learning inference on\nRISC-V architectures. We introduce MaRVIn, a cross-layer hardware-software\nco-design framework that enhances power efficiency and performance through a\ncombination of hardware improvements, mixed-precision quantization, ISA-level\noptimizations, and cycle-accurate emulation. At the hardware level, we enhance\nthe ALU with configurable mixed-precision arithmetic (2, 4, 8 bits) for\nweights/activations and employ multi-pumping to reduce execution latency while\nimplementing soft SIMD for efficient 2-bit ops. At the software level, we\nintegrate a pruning-aware fine-tuning method to optimize model compression and\na greedy-based DSE approach to efficiently search for Pareto-optimal\nmixed-quantized models. Additionally, we incorporate voltage scaling to boost\nthe power efficiency of our system. Our experimental evaluation over widely\nused DNNs and datasets, such as CIFAR10 and ImageNet, demonstrates that our\nframework can achieve, on average, 17.6x speedup for less than 1% accuracy loss\nand outperforms the ISA-agnostic state-of-the-art RISC-V cores, delivering up\nto 1.8 TOPs/W."}

Unlike\nprior approaches such as Test-Time Reinforcement Learning (TTRL), which\nprimarily adapt models to the immediate unlabeled dataset at hand, our goal is\nbroader: to enable general improvements without sacrificing the model's\ninherent exploration capacity and generalization ability, i.e., evolving.

While most prior work assumes a known causal\nmodel, recent efforts relax this assumption by enforcing additional\nconstraints. However, these approaches often fail to capture broader attribute\nrelationships that are critical to maintaining utility. This raises a\nfundamental question: Can we harness the benefits of causal reasoning to design\nefficient and effective fairness solutions without relying on strong\nassumptions about the underlying causal model? In this paper, we seek to answer\nthis question by introducing CausalPre, a scalable and effective\ncausality-guided data pre-processing framework that guarantees justifiable\nfairness, a strong causal notion of fairness. CausalPre extracts causally fair\nrelationships by reformulating the originally complex and computationally\ninfeasible extraction task into a tailored distribution estimation problem. To\nensure scalability, CausalPre adopts a carefully crafted variant of\nlow-dimensional marginal factorization to approximate the joint distribution,\ncomplemented by a heuristic algorithm that efficiently tackles the associated\ncomputational challenge. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets\ndemonstrate that CausalPre is both effective and scalable, challenging the\nconventional belief that achieving causal fairness requires trading off\nrelationship coverage for relaxed model assumptions."}
