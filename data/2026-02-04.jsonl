Unlike classical consensus, no single output is required. We show Prefix Consensus is solvable asynchronously and give tight round-complexity bounds.\n  We then define \\emph{Strong Prefix Consensus}, requiring agreement on the \\emph{high} output. Our protocol is leaderless and partially synchronous: one Prefix Consensus instance decides (possibly different) lows, and additional instances yield a unique safe-to-extend high, even if an adversary can suspend one party per round.\n  We lift this to a leaderless, multi-proposer, censorship-resistant BFT SMR protocol: per slot, all parties broadcast proposals, deterministically rank them, and run one Strong Prefix Consensus on proposal hashes, committing honest proposals in \\emph{four rounds}. A deterministic demotion rule updates the ranking when a party's proposal is excluded, implying that after GST at most $f$ slots can miss an honest proposal while progress remains leaderless under suspension and up to $f{-}1$ Byzantine faults.\n  Finally, we connect Prefix Consensus to graded and binary/validated consensus: we obtain an optimal-latency graded consensus (3 message delays) and leaderless Binary/Validated Consensus with worst-case message complexity $O(n^3)$ and communication $O(n^4)$."}

A key operational challenge arises from the two-phase nature of LLM inference: a compute-intensive \\emph{prefill} phase that processes user input, followed by a memory-bound \\emph{decode} phase that generates output tokens. When these phases share GPU resources, prefill tasks throttle the processing speed of concurrent decodes, creating state-dependent contention. This contention is further complicated by workload heterogeneity, as different applications exhibit vastly different input and output lengths. We develop a stochastic control framework for scheduling heterogeneous LLM workloads across large GPU clusters. We formulate LLM inference as a multiclass many-server queueing network with state-dependent service rates, grounded in empirical iteration-time measurements. We analyze the fluid approximation of this system and solve steady-state linear programs that characterize optimal resource allocation. We design gate-and-route policies that regulate prefill admission and decode routing, and prove that they are asymptotically optimal in the many-GPU limit under both bundled and separate token-pricing schemes. We further extend the framework to incorporate Service Level Indicators (SLIs) such as latency and fairness, providing a general approach to constrained scheduling. Numerical experiments calibrated to empirical iteration-time data demonstrate that our policies outperform standard serving heuristics."}

We show that the resulting flow-weighted end-to-end delay minimization is a convex program, yielding a global system-optimal solution characterized by KKT conditions that equalize total marginal costs (a path marginal access term plus a node congestion price) across all utilized routes. This condition admits a Wardrop-type interpretation: for each source, all utilized options equalize total marginal cost, while any option with strictly larger total marginal cost receives no flow. Building on this structure, we develop a lightweight distributed pricing-based algorithm in which each service node locally computes and broadcasts a scalar congestion price from its observed aggregate load, while each source updates its traffic split by solving a small separable convex allocation problem under the advertised prices. Numerical illustrations demonstrate convergence of the distributed iteration to the centralized optimum and highlight the trade-offs induced by jointly modeling access and service congestion."}

Despite significant progress, existing methods still face challenges, such as inefficient parameter reuse across tasks, risking catastrophic forgetting when tasks are dissimilar, and the unnecessary introduction of new parameters for each task, which hampers knowledge sharing among similar tasks. To tackle these issues, we propose a Sparse Adapter Fusion Method (SAFM), which dynamically fuses old and new adapters to address these challenges. SAFM operates in two stages: the decision stage and the tuning stage. In the decision stage, SAFM determines whether to incorporate a new adapter, reuse an existing one, or add an empty adapter. The architecture search procedure, designed to prioritize reusing or adding empty adapters, minimizes parameter consumption and maximizes reuse. In the tuning stage, SAFM especially facilitates a layer-wise loss to encourage differentiation between adapters, effectively capturing knowledge within the same task. Experimental results consistently show that SAFM outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods, achieving comparable performance while utilizing less than 60% of the parameters."}

Offloading MoE expert parameters to host memory and leveraging both CPU and GPU computation has recently emerged as a promising direction to support such models on resourceconstrained local PC platforms. While promising, we notice that existing approaches mismatch the dynamic nature of expert workloads, which leads to three fundamental inefficiencies: (1) Static expert assignment causes severe CPUGPU load imbalance, underutilizing CPU and GPU resources; (2) Existing prefetching techniques fail to accurately predict high-workload experts, leading to costly inaccurate prefetches; (3) GPU cache policies neglect workload dynamics, resulting in poor hit rates and limited effectiveness. To address these challenges, we propose DALI, a workloaDAware offLoadIng framework for efficient MoE inference on local PCs. To fully utilize hardware resources, DALI first dynamically assigns experts to CPU or GPU by modeling assignment as a 0-1 integer optimization problem and solving it efficiently using a Greedy Assignment strategy at runtime. To improve prefetching accuracy, we develop a Residual-Based Prefetching method leveraging inter-layer residual information to accurately predict high-workload experts. Additionally, we introduce a Workload-Aware Cache Replacement policy that exploits temporal correlation in expert activations to improve GPU cache efficiency. By evaluating across various MoE models and settings, DALI achieves significant speedups in the both prefill and decoding phases over the state-of-the-art offloading frameworks."}

Such graph-central paradigm breaks down on composite materials, which possess continuous and nonlinear design spaces that lack well-defined graph structures. General composite descriptors, e.g., fiber volume and misalignment angle, cannot fully capture the fiber distributions that fundamentally determine microstructural characteristics, necessitating the integration of heterogeneous data sources through multimodal learning. Existing alignment-oriented multimodal frameworks have proven effective on abundant crystal or polymer data under discrete, unique graph-property mapping assumptions, but fail to address the highly continuous composite design space under extreme data scarcity. In this work, we introduce ORDinal-aware imagE-tabulaR alignment (ORDER), a multimodal pretraining framework that establishes ordinality as a core principle for composite material representations. ORDER ensures that materials with similar target properties occupy nearby regions in the latent space, which effectively preserves the continuous nature of composite properties and enables meaningful interpolation between sparsely observed designs. We evaluate ORDER on a public Nanofiber-enforced composite dataset and an internally curated dataset that simulates the construction of carbon fiber T700 with diverse fiber distributions.

This systematic review synthesizes computational methods used to predict length of stay in this patient population, highlighting model performance and key predictors. Methods: Following PRISMA guidelines, we systematically searched PubMed, Google Scholar, and ACM Digital Library for studies published between December 1st, 2015, and December 1st, 2024. Eligible studies applied statistical or machine learning models to predict length of stay for elective spine surgery patients. Three reviewers independently screened studies and extracted data. Results: Out of 1,263 screened studies, 29 studies met inclusion criteria. Length of stay was predicted as a continuous, binary, or percentile-based outcome. Models included logistic regression, random forest, boosting algorithms, and neural networks. Machine learning models consistently outperformed traditional statistical models, with AUCs ranging from 0.94 to 0.99. K-Nearest Neighbors and Naive Bayes achieved top performance in some studies. Common predictors included age, comorbidities (notably hypertension and diabetes), BMI, type and duration of surgery, and number of spinal levels. However, external validation and reporting practices varied widely across studies. Discussion: There is growing interest in artificial intelligence and machine learning in length of stay prediction, but lack of standardization and external validation limits clinical utility. Future studies should prioritize standardized outcome definitions and transparent reporting needed to advance real-world deployment. Conclusion: Machine learning models offer strong potential for length of stay prediction after elective spine surgery, highlighting their potential for improving discharge planning and hospital resource management."}

However, DL struggles to train a high accuracy model when the data distribution is non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) and when the communication topology is static. To address these issues, we propose Morph, a topology optimization algorithm for DL. In Morph, nodes adaptively choose peers for model exchange based on maximum model dissimilarity. Morph maintains a fixed in-degree while dynamically reshaping the communication graph through gossip-based peer discovery and diversity-driven neighbor selection, thereby improving robustness to data heterogeneity. Experiments on CIFAR-10 and FEMNIST with up to 100 nodes show that Morph consistently outperforms static and epidemic baselines, while closely tracking the fully connected upper bound. On CIFAR-10, Morph achieves a relative improvement of 1.12x in test accuracy compared to the state-of-the-art baselines. On FEMNIST, Morph achieves an accuracy that is 1.08x higher than Epidemic Learning. Similar trends hold for 50 node deployments, where Morph narrows the gap to the fully connected upper bound within 0.5 percentage points on CIFAR-10. These results demonstrate that Morph achieves higher final accuracy, faster convergence, and more stable learning as quantified by lower inter-node variance, while requiring fewer communication rounds than baselines and no global knowledge."}

The rationale for SDPA has been based upon \"query, key, value\" concepts borrowed from database theory, but these concepts are difficult to reconcile with standard methods in mathematical signal processing. We show that SDPA can be rewritten in a different but mathematically equivalent form as a projection of the input vectors onto a common surface determined by the inputs themselves. Therefore SDPA discovers nonlinear dependencies in the input that are time-dependent and context-dependent. The rewritten form of SDPA permits increased speed of both feedforward and learning algorithms, but more importantly suggests potential extensions. In the context of language, we re-interpret the role of SDPA as finding a time-dependent contextual meaning determined by the surface on which the set of input vectors lies. Input token embeddings are then modified by the local context surface. This interpretation differs substantially from the concept of \"self-attention\", and provides a strong justification for the use of SDPA for time-series data with time-varying local nonlinear dependencies."}

Under review", "summary": "Asynchronous pipeline parallelism maximizes hardware utilization by eliminating the pipeline bubbles inherent in synchronous execution, offering a path toward efficient large-scale distributed training. However, this efficiency gain can be compromised by gradient staleness, where the immediate model updates with delayed gradients introduce noise into the optimization process. Crucially, we identify a critical, yet often overlooked, pathology: this delay scales linearly with pipeline depth, fundamentally undermining the very scalability that the method originally intends to provide. In this work, we investigate this inconsistency and bridge the gap by rectifying delayed gradients through basis rotation, restoring scalable asynchronous training while maintaining performance. Specifically, we observe that the deleterious effects of delayed gradients are exacerbated when the Hessian eigenbasis is misaligned with the standard coordinate basis. We demonstrate that this misalignment prevents coordinate-wise adaptive schemes, such as Adam, from effectively leveraging curvature-aware adaptivity. This failure leads to significant oscillations in the optimization trajectory and, consequently, slower convergence. We substantiate these findings through both rigorous theoretical analysis and empirical evaluation. To address this challenge, we propose the use of basis rotation, demonstrating that it effectively mitigates the alignment issue and significantly accelerates convergence in asynchronous settings. For example, our training of a 1B-parameter LLM with basis rotation achieves the same training loss in 76.8% fewer iterations compared to the best-performing asynchronous pipeline parallel training baseline."}

However, there exists a very large category of high-value tabular data, including financial modeling and physical simulations, which are generated based upon deterministic computational processes, as opposed to stochastic and noisy relationships. Therefore, we investigate if tabular models can provide an extension from statistical interpolation to computational extrapolation.\n  We propose TabularMath, a diagnostic benchmark of 114 deterministic problems (233,472 rows) generated from verified programs based on GSM8K and AIME. We evaluate 9 tabular architectures and in-context learning (ICL) with GPT-OSS-120B. On standard regression metrics, TabPFN v2.5 performs remarkably well, achieving R^2=0.998 in-distribution and maintaining positive R^2 even under distribution shift, which is unique among the tabular models we tested. When we measure rounded consistency (exact integer match), a different picture emerges: TabPFN v2.5 drops below 10% on out-of-distribution data, while ICL maintains around 40%. This gap between R^2 and exact-match accuracy suggests that tabular models learn smooth function approximations but struggle to recover precise computational outputs under extrapolation. The two paradigms appear complementary: TabPFN scales efficiently with data; ICL achieves exact computation from few examples. We release all code and data to support further investigation."}

This phenomenon represents a total collapse of the latent manifold (Global Effective Rank 3.62 -> 2.22), where the model discards diverse world knowledge to optimize for statistically safe syntactic templates. To address this, we apply the Multi-Scale Negative Coupled Information Systems (MNCIS) framework recently established in Hou (2026) [arXiv:2601.11594]. We demonstrate that Adaptive Spectral Negative Coupling (ASNC) acts as a topological operator that actively induces \"Manifold Unfolding.\" MNCIS forces the model to expand its effective rank from the anisotropic baseline of 3.62 to a hyper-diverse state of 5.35, effectively constructing an \"Artificial Manifold\" that resists the gravitational pull of semantic attractors and preserves the long-tail distribution of the training data."}

However, most existing work focuses exclusively on capturing spatio-temporal dependencies from historical traffic data, while overlooking the fact that suddenly occurring transportation incidents, such as traffic accidents and adverse weather, serve as external disturbances that can substantially alter temporal patterns. We argue that this issue has become a major obstacle to modeling the dynamics of traffic systems and improving prediction accuracy, but the unpredictability of incidents makes it difficult to observe patterns from historical sequences. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a novel framework named the Incident-Guided Spatiotemporal Graph Neural Network (IGSTGNN). IGSTGNN explicitly models the incident's impact through two core components: an Incident-Context Spatial Fusion (ICSF) module to capture the initial heterogeneous spatial influence, and a Temporal Incident Impact Decay (TIID) module to model the subsequent dynamic dissipation. To facilitate research on the spatio-temporal impact of incidents on traffic flow, a large-scale dataset is constructed and released, featuring incident records that are time-aligned with traffic time series. On this new benchmark, the proposed IGSTGNN framework is demonstrated to achieve state-of-the-art performance. Furthermore, the generalizability of the ICSF and TIID modules is validated by integrating them into various existing models."}

Deploying RL in real-world settings, especially in the context of human-robot interaction, requires defining state representations and reward functions, which are critical for learning efficiency and policy performance. Traditional RL approaches often rely on domain expertise and trial-and-error, necessitating extensive human involvement as well as direct interaction with the environment, which can be costly and impractical, especially in complex and safety-critical applications. This work proposes a novel RL framework that leverages off-policy evaluation (OPE) for state space and reward function selection, using only logged interaction data. This approach eliminates the need for real-time access to the environment or human-in-the-loop feedback, greatly reducing the dependency on costly real-time interactions. The proposed approach systematically evaluates multiple candidate state representations and reward functions by training offline RL agents and applying OPE to estimate policy performance. The optimal state space and reward function are selected based on their ability to produce high-performing policies under OPE metrics. Our method is validated on two environments: the Lunar Lander environment by OpenAI Gym, which provides a controlled setting for assessing state space and reward function selection, and a NASA-MATB-II human subjects study environment, which evaluates the approach's real-world applicability to human-robot teaming scenarios. This work enhances the feasibility and scalability of offline RL for real-world environments by automating critical RL design decisions through a data-driven OPE-based evaluation, enabling more reliable, effective, and sustainable RL formulation for complex human-robot interaction settings."}

The in-house CFD solver enables high-fidelity simulations with adaptive mesh refinement, resolving key flow features, including shock motion, boundary-layer dynamics, and flow separation, that are essential for learning physically consistent control policies suitable for real-time deployment. The DRL controller robustly stabilizes the inlet over a wide range of back pressures representative of varying combustion chamber conditions. It further generalizes to previously unseen scenarios, including different back-pressure levels, Reynolds numbers, and sensor configurations, while operating with noisy measurements, thereby demonstrating strong zero-shot generalization. Control remains robust in the presence of noisy sensor measurements, and a minimal, optimally selected sensor set achieves comparable performance, enabling practical implementation.

In this paper, an explainable framework based on a fine-tuned hybrid Deep Neural Network (DNN) and Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) called HyExDNN-RNN model is proposed for ADHD detection, multi-class categorization, and decision interpretation. This framework not only detects ADHD, but also provides interpretable insights into the diagnostic process so that psychologists can better understand and trust the results of the diagnosis. We use the Pearson correlation coefficient for optimal feature selection and machine and deep learning models for experimental analysis and comparison.

Despite the success of textual safety moderation, its multimodal counterparts remain hindered by a dual sparsity of data and supervision. Conventional reliance on binary labels lead to shortcut learning, which obscures the intrinsic classification boundaries necessary for effective multimodal discrimination. Hence, we propose a novel learning paradigm (UniMod) that transitions from sparse decision-making to dense reasoning traces. By constructing structured trajectories encompassing evidence grounding, modality assessment, risk mapping, policy decision, and response generation, we reformulate monolithic decision tasks into a multi-dimensional boundary learning process. This approach forces the model to ground its decision in explicit safety semantics, preventing the model from converging on superficial shortcuts. To facilitate this paradigm, we develop a multi-head scalar reward model (UniRM). UniRM provides multi-dimensional supervision by assigning attribute-level scores to the response generation stage. Furthermore, we introduce specialized optimization strategies to decouple task-specific parameters and rebalance training dynamics, effectively resolving interference between diverse objectives in multi-task learning. Empirical results show UniMod achieves competitive textual moderation performance and sets a new multimodal benchmark using less than 40\\% of the training data used by leading baselines. Ablations further validate our multi-attribute trajectory reasoning, offering an effective and efficient framework for multimodal moderation.

Although this method is efficient, it suffers from quantization bias and error accumulation, resulting in suboptimal and unstable quantization, especially when the calibration data is biased. To overcome these issues, we propose Future-Aware Quantization (FAQ), which leverages future-layer activations to guide quantization. This allows better identification and preservation of important weights, while reducing sensitivity to calibration noise. We further introduce a window-wise preview mechanism to softly aggregate multiple future-layer activations, mitigating over-reliance on any single layer. To avoid expensive greedy search, we use a pre-searched configuration to minimize overhead. Experiments show that FAQ consistently outperforms prior methods with negligible extra cost, requiring no backward passes, data reconstruction, or tuning, making it well-suited for edge deployment."}

Represented by DeepSeek-OCR, these models encode rendered text into continuous vision tokens, achieving high compression rates without sacrificing recognition precision. However, viewing the vision encoder as a lossy channel with finite representational capacity raises a fundamental question: what is the information upper bound of visual tokens? To investigate this limit, we conduct controlled stress tests by progressively increasing the information quantity (character count) within an image. We observe a distinct phase-transition phenomenon characterized by three regimes: a near-perfect Stable Phase, an Instability Phase marked by increased error variance, and a total Collapse Phase. We analyze the mechanical origins of these transitions and identify key factors. Furthermore, we formulate a probabilistic scaling law that unifies average vision token load and visual density into a latent difficulty metric. Extensive experiments across various Vision-Language Models demonstrate the universality of this scaling law, providing critical empirical guidance for optimizing the efficiency-accuracy trade-off in visual context compression."}

To reduce the augmentation burden, we propose an end-to-end auto-augmentation contrastive learning (AutoCL) method for wearable-based HAR. AutoCL is based on a Siamese network architecture that shares the parameters of the backbone and with a generator embedded to learn auto-augmentation. AutoCL trains the generator based on the representation in the latent space to overcome the disturbances caused by noise and redundant information in raw sensor data. The architecture empirical study indicates the effectiveness of this design.

However, long sequences of edits often trigger abrupt model collapse in L&E beyond a critical point. We empirically identify a strong correlation between collapse and explosive growth of edited MLP weight norms, and formally prove that commonly used L&E update rules can induce exponential norm growth across sequential edits in the absence of explicit norm control. To address this issue, we propose Norm-Anchor Scaling NAS, a plug-and-play norm-constrained strategy.

To address these challenges, we present SPA-Cache that jointly optimizes update identification and budget allocation in DLM cache. First, we derive a low-dimensional singular proxy that enables the identification of update-critical tokens in a low-dimensional subspace, substantially reducing the overhead of update identification. Second, we introduce an adaptive strategy that allocates fewer updates to stable layers without degrading generation quality.

In this work, we challenge this accessibility boundary hypothesis by demonstrating that the latent reasoning space can be fundamentally expanded through targeted geometric interventions. We propose Manifold-Reshaping Policy Optimization (MRPO), a geometric framework designed to fundamentally restructure the inference space of LLMs. MRPO operates in two stages: first, we employ Spectral Orthogonal Exploration (SOE) to eject the policy initialization into the null space of the bias manifold; second, we integrate an Effective Rank regularization term into the policy optimization objective. This approach incentivizes the discovery and maintenance of high-dimensional reasoning trajectories against the entropy-reducing tendency of standard RL.

This approach allows models to be trained using only code, substantially increasing the available training examples. Evaluated on HumanEval and MBPP with a 7B model, BatCoder achieved 83.5% and 81.0% pass@1, outperforming strong open-source baselines. Moreover, the framework demonstrates consistent scaling with respect to both training corpus size and model capacity."}

We address this limitation with PSN-RLVR, which perturbs policy parameters before rollout generation to induce temporally consistent, trajectory-level exploration that better preserves long-horizon chain-of-thought coherence than action-space noise. To mitigate the resulting sampling-update mismatch, we incorporate truncated importance sampling (TIS). To avoid expensive KL-based adaptive noise control, we propose a computationally efficient real-time adaptive noise scheduler driven by a lightweight surrogate that combines semantic diversity with normalized self-certainty. Instantiated on GRPO, a widely used RLVR method, PSN-GRPO consistently expands the effective reasoning capability boundary across multiple mathematical reasoning benchmarks and model families, yielding higher pass-at-k under large sampling budgets and outperforming prior exploration-oriented RLVR methods (e.g., Pass-at-k-style training) while remaining orthogonal and thus composable for additional gains."}

In this work, we study the cross-modality transfer of jailbreak attacks from text to audio, motivated by the semantic similarity between the two modalities and the maturity of textual jailbreak methods. We first analyze the connection between modality alignment and cross-modality jailbreak transfer, showing that strong alignment can inadvertently propagate textual vulnerabilities to the audio modality, which we term the alignment curse. Guided by this analysis, we conduct an empirical evaluation of textual jailbreaks, text-transferred audio jailbreaks, and existing audio-based jailbreaks on recent omni-models. Our results show that text-transferred audio jailbreaks perform comparably to, and often better than, audio-based jailbreaks, establishing them as simple yet powerful baselines for future audio red-teaming. We further demonstrate strong cross-model transferability and show that text-transferred audio attacks remain effective even under a stricter audio-only access threat model."}

However, most existing methods are limited to providing prediction interpretability by locating the model's salient areas in a post-hoc manner, failing to offer more reliable and accountable explanations. In this work, we propose Phenotype-Aware Multiple Instance Learning (PA-MIL), a novel ante-hoc interpretable framework that identifies cancer-related phenotypes from WSIs and utilizes them for cancer subtyping. To facilitate PA-MIL in learning phenotype-aware features, we 1) construct a phenotype knowledge base containing cancer-related phenotypes and their associated genotypes. 2) utilize the morphological descriptions of phenotypes as language prompting to aggregate phenotype-related features. 3) devise the Genotype-to-Phenotype Neural Network (GP-NN) grounded in genotype-to-phenotype relationships, which provides multi-level guidance for PA-MIL. Experimental results on multiple datasets demonstrate that PA-MIL achieves competitive performance compared to existing MIL methods while offering improved interpretability. PA-MIL leverages phenotype saliency as evidence and, using a linear classifier, achieves competitive results compared to state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, we thoroughly analyze the genotype-phenotype relationships, as well as cohort-level and case-level interpretability, demonstrating the reliability and accountability of PA-MIL."}

This correlation-based approach overlooks the model's actual reasoning mechanism, necessitating a shift to causal verification to ensure robust decision-making before clinical deployment. We propose S(H)NAP, a model-agnostic auditing framework that constructs generative interventional attributions validated by expert radiologists. By leveraging realistic 3D diffusion bridge modeling to systematically modify anatomical features, our approach isolates object-specific causal contributions to the risk score.

However, these models frequently exhibit suboptimal performance when spatiotemporal discrepancies exist between inputs and labels, for instance, when nodes with similar time-series inputs manifest distinct future labels, or vice versa. To address this limitation, we propose explicitly incorporating label features during the training phase. Specifically, we introduce the Spatiotemporal Residual Theorem, which generalizes the conventional unidirectional spatiotemporal prediction paradigm into a bidirectional learning framework. Building upon this theoretical foundation, we design an universal module, termed ReLearner, which seamlessly augments Spatiotemporal Neural Networks (STNNs) with a bidirectional learning capability via an auxiliary inverse learning process. In this process, the model relearns the spatiotemporal feature residuals between input data and future data. The proposed ReLearner comprises two critical components: (1) a Residual Learning Module, designed to effectively disentangle spatiotemporal feature discrepancies between input and label representations; and (2) a Residual Smoothing Module, employed to smooth residual terms and facilitate stable convergence. Extensive experiments conducted on 11 real-world datasets across 14 backbone models demonstrate that ReLearner significantly enhances the predictive performance of existing STNNs.Our code is available on GitHub."}

Studies found that unfairness may be due to feedback loops and being trained on historically biased recorded data. However, comparative studies on predictive policing systems are few and are not sufficiently comprehensive. In this work, we perform a comprehensive comparative simulation study on the fairness and accuracy of predictive policing technologies in Baltimore. Our results suggest that the situation around bias in predictive policing is more complex than was previously assumed. While predictive policing exhibited bias due to feedback loops as was previously reported, we found that the traditional alternative, hot spots policing, had similar issues. Predictive policing was found to be more fair and accurate than hot spots policing in the short term, although it amplified bias faster, suggesting the potential for worse long-run behavior. In Baltimore, in some cases the bias in these systems tended toward over-policing in White neighborhoods, unlike in previous studies. Overall, this work demonstrates a methodology for city-specific evaluation and behavioral-tendency comparison of predictive policing systems, showing how such simulations can reveal inequities and long-term tendencies."}

Recent advances in artificial intelligence have facilitated the development of skillful pan-Arctic sea ice forecasting systems, where data-driven approaches showcase tremendous potential to outperform conventional physics-based numerical models in terms of accuracy, computational efficiency and forecasting lead times. Despite the latest progress made by deep learning (DL) forecasting models, most of their skillful forecasting lead times are confined to daily subseasonal scale and monthly averaged values for up to six months, which drastically hinders their deployment for real-world applications, e.g., maritime routine planning for Arctic transportation and scientific investigation. Extending daily forecasts from subseasonal to seasonal (S2S) scale is scientifically crucial for operational applications. To bridge the gap between the forecasting lead time of current DL models and the significant daily S2S scale, we introduce IceBench-S2S, the first comprehensive benchmark for evaluating DL approaches in mitigating the challenge of forecasting Arctic sea ice concentration in successive 180-day periods. It proposes a generalized framework that first compresses spatial features of daily sea ice data into a deep latent space. The temporally concatenated deep features are subsequently modeled by DL-based forecasting backbones to predict the sea ice variation at S2S scale. IceBench-S2S provides a unified training and evaluation pipeline for different backbones, along with practical guidance for model selection in polar environmental monitoring tasks."}

While amplifying rewards for preferred outputs can mitigate this bias, it also increases the risk of reward hacking. This tradeoff motivates the problem of optimally designing reward models under KL regularization. We formalize this reward model optimization problem as a Stackelberg game, and show that a simple reward shaping scheme can effectively approximate the optimal reward model.

We hypothesize that the smallest and largest weight updates during fine-tuning are more important than those of intermediate magnitude, a phenomenon we term \"protecting both ends\". Upon hypothesis validation, we introduce QuantLRM, which stands for weight quantization of LRMs via fine-tuning signals. We fit simple restricted quadratic functions on weight updates to protect both ends. By multiplying the average quadratic values with the count of zero weight updates of channels, we compute channel importance that is more effective than using activation or second-order information. We run QuantLRM to quantize various fine-tuned models (including supervised, direct preference optimization, and reinforcement learning fine-tuning) over four reasoning benchmarks (AIME-120, FOLIO, temporal sequences, and GPQA-Diamond) and empirically find that QuantLRM delivers a consistent improvement for LRMs quantization, with an average improvement of 6.55% on a reinforcement learning fine-tuned model.

In practice, however, system operators often lack access to fleet-level probabilistic models and instead rely on site-level forecasts produced by heterogeneous third-party providers. Constructing coherent and calibrated fleet-level probabilistic forecasts from such inputs remains challenging due to complex cross-site dependencies and aggregation-induced miscalibration. This paper proposes a calibrated probabilistic aggregation framework that directly converts site-level probabilistic forecasts into reliable fleet-level forecasts in settings where system-level models cannot be trained or maintained. The framework integrates copula-based dependence modeling to capture cross-site correlations with Context-Aware Conformal Prediction (CACP) to correct miscalibration at the aggregated level. This combination enables dependence-aware aggregation while providing valid coverage and maintaining sharp prediction intervals. Experiments on large-scale solar generation datasets from MISO, ERCOT, and SPP demonstrate that the proposed Copula+CACP approach consistently achieves near-nominal coverage with significantly sharper intervals than uncalibrated aggregation baselines."}

While effective in many settings, these measures entangle intrinsic changes in the data with variations induced by arbitrary parametrizations. We introduce a projective geometric view of representation drift grounded in the Fubini Study metric, which identifies representations that differ only by gauge transformations such as global rescalings or sign flips. Applying this framework to empirical high dimensional datasets, we explicitly construct representation trajectories and track their evolution through cumulative geometric drift. Comparing Euclidean, cosine and Fubini Study distances along these trajectories reveals that conventional metrics systematically overestimate change whenever representations carry genuine projective ambiguity. By contrast, the Fubini Study metric isolates intrinsic evolution by remaining invariant under gauge-induced fluctuations. We further show that the difference between cosine and Fubini Study drift defines a computable, monotone quantity that directly captures representation churn attributable to gauge freedom. This separation provides a diagnostic for distinguishing meaningful structural evolution from parametrization artifacts, without introducing model-specific assumptions. Overall, we establish a geometric criterion for assessing representation stability in high-dimensional systems and clarify the limits of angular distances. Embedding representation dynamics in projective space connects data analysis with established geometric programs and yields observables that are directly testable in empirical workflows."}

Our analysis reveals that the sampling strategy itself plays a central role in safety behavior, as a factor distinct from the underlying learned representations. Motivated by this analysis, we introduce the Step-Wise Refusal Internal Dynamics (SRI) signal, which supports interpretability and improved safety for both AR and DLMs. We demonstrate that the geometric structure of SRI captures internal recovery dynamics, and identifies anomalous behavior in harmful generations as cases of \\emph{incomplete internal recovery} that are not observable at the text level. This structure enables lightweight inference-time detectors that generalize to unseen attacks while matching or outperforming existing defenses with over $100\\times$ lower inference overhead."}

The resulting arc-lengths along these flows define interpretable intrinsic coordinates tied to a shared global frame. To prevent degenerate collapse, we enforce a non-shrinking constraint and derive a scalable, integration-free objective inspired by flow matching. Within our theoretical framework, we prove that minimizing the proposed objective recovers a global coordinate chart when one exists.

We study generalized behavior discovery in short multivariate motion snippets from gulls, where each sample is a sequence with 3-axis IMU acceleration (20 Hz) and GPS speed, spanning nine expert-annotated behavior categories. We propose a semi-supervised discovery pipeline that (i) learns an embedding function from the labeled subset, (ii) performs label-guided clustering over embeddings of both labeled and unlabeled samples to form candidate behavior groups, and (iii) decides whether a discovered group is truly novel using a containment score. Our key contribution is a KDE + HDR (highest-density region) containment score that measures how much a discovered cluster distribution is contained within, or contains, each known-class distribution; the best-match containment score serves as an interpretable novelty statistic. In experiments where an entire behavior is withheld from supervision and appears only in the unlabeled pool, the method recovers a distinct cluster and the containment score flags novelty via low overlap, while a negative-control setting with no novel behavior yields consistently higher overlaps. These results suggest that HDR-based containment provides a practical, quantitative test for generalized class discovery in ecological motion time series under limited annotation and severe class imbalance."}

The core bottleneck lies in the scarcity of training data that captures authentic long-dependency structures and cross-stage evolutionary dynamics--existing synthesis methods either confine to single-feature scenarios constrained by model distribution, or incur prohibitive human annotation costs, failing to provide scalable, high-quality supervision. We address this by reconceptualizing data synthesis through the lens of real-world software evolution. Our key insight: Pull Request (PR) sequences naturally embody the supervision signals for long-horizon learning. They decompose complex objectives into verifiable submission units, maintain functional coherence across iterations, and encode authentic refinement patterns through bug-fix histories. Building on this, we propose daVinci-Agency, which systematically mines structured supervision from chain-of-PRs through three interlocking mechanisms: (1) progressive task decomposition via continuous commits, (2) long-term consistency enforcement through unified functional objectives, and (3) verifiable refinement from authentic bug-fix trajectories. Unlike synthetic trajectories that treat each step independently, daVinci-Agency's PR-grounded structure inherently preserves the causal dependencies and iterative refinements essential for teaching persistent goal-directed behavior and enables natural alignment with project-level, full-cycle task modeling. The resulting trajectories are substantial--averaging 85k tokens and 116 tool calls--yet remarkably data-efficient: fine-tuning GLM-4.6 on 239 daVinci-Agency samples yields broad improvements across benchmarks, notably achieving a 47% relative gain on Toolathlon.

In this work, we investigate the performance of pretraining techniques for smaller-sized LLMs on an experimental testbed (with commodity GPUs) available to academic users at no charge. We consider data parallelism, intra-operator parallelism, and inter-operator/pipeline parallelism, and their combinations for pretraining.

We used GPT-2 medium and large models and pretrained them using open-source packages, namely, Alpa and Ray. We observed that Alpa's execution plans that collectively optimized intra-operator and inter-operator/pipeline parallelism consistently performed the best when GPUs were geographically distributed.

What governs the quality of generations in such systems? We present the first ever systematic investigation of this question. A priori, the expectation is that minimizing denoising trajectory sensitivity -- minimizing how perturbations amplify during sampling -- should govern generation quality. We demonstrate this hypothesis is incorrect: a stability-quality dissociation. Full ensemble routing, which combines all expert predictions at each step, achieves the most stable sampling dynamics and best numerical convergence while producing the worst generation quality (FID 47.9 vs. 22.6 for sparse Top-2 routing). Instead, we identify expert-data alignment as the governing principle: generation quality depends on routing inputs to experts whose training distribution covers the current denoising state. Across two distinct DDM systems, we validate expert-data alignment using (i) data-cluster distance analysis, confirming sparse routing selects experts with data clusters closest to the current denoising state, and (ii) per-expert analysis, showing selected experts produce more accurate predictions than non-selected ones, and (iii) expert disagreement analysis, showing quality degrades when experts disagree. For DDM deployment, our findings establish that routing should prioritize expert-data alignment over numerical stability metrics."}

Practically, it suggests that tasks requiring equality-like comparisons (exact match, membership, etc.) are especially sensitive to quantization. Dropping even one bit can cross a threshold where the model cannot represent the needed comparison reliably. Thus, it paves the way for developing heuristics that will help practitioners choose how much quantization is possible: the precision should be chosen as a function of the length of equality to be checked for the specific task.\n  Our proofs combine explicit finite-precision Transformer constructions with communication-complexity lower bounds, yielding a tight \"one-bit\" threshold."}

MaxRL addresses the challenges of non-differentiable sampling by defining a compute-indexed family of sample-based objectives that interpolate between standard reinforcement learning and exact maximum likelihood as additional sampling compute is allocated.

In this work, we propose a zero-shot generation framework for parametric engineering design based on TabPFN, enabling conditional design generation using only a limited number of reference samples and without any task-specific model training or fine-tuning. The proposed method generates design parameters sequentially conditioned on target performance indicators, providing a flexible alternative to conventional generative models. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is evaluated on three engineering design datasets, i.e., ship hull design, BlendedNet aircraft, and UIUC airfoil. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves competitive diversity across highly structured parametric design spaces, remains robust to variations in sampling, resolution and parameter dimensionality of geometry generation, and achieves a low performance error (e.g., less than 2% in generated ship hull designs' performance). Compared with diffusion-based generative models, the proposed framework significantly reduces computational overhead and data requirements while preserving reliable generation performance. These results highlight the potential of zero-shot, data-efficient generation as a practical and efficient tool for engineering design, enabling rapid deployment, flexible adaptation to new design settings, and ease of integration into real-world engineering workflows."}

Their reliance on extrinsic geometry renders them highly sensitive to latent space perturbations, causing performance to degrade during cross-architecture transfer or in the presence of feature noise. We introduce TopoPrune, a framework which resolves this challenge by leveraging topology to capture the stable, intrinsic structure of data. TopoPrune operates at two scales, (1) utilizing a topology-aware manifold approximation to establish a global low-dimensional embedding of the dataset. Subsequently, (2) it employs differentiable persistent homology to perform a local topological optimization on the manifold embeddings, ranking samples by their structural complexity. We demonstrate that our unified dual-scale topological approach ensures high accuracy and precision, particularly at significant dataset pruning rates (e.g., 90%). Furthermore, through the inherent stability properties of topology, TopoPrune is (a) exceptionally robust to noise perturbations of latent feature embeddings and (b) demonstrates superior transferability across diverse network architectures. This study demonstrates a promising avenue towards stable and principled topology-based frameworks for robust data-efficient learning."}

An IDM can act as a policy when paired with a video model (VM-IDM) or as a label generator to perform behavior cloning on action-free data (IDM labeling). In this work, we first show that VM-IDM and IDM labeling learn the same policy in a limit case, which we call the IDM-based policy. We then argue that the previously observed advantage of IDM-based policies over behavior cloning is due to the superior sample efficiency of IDM learning, which we attribute to two causes: (i) the ground-truth IDM tends to be contained in a lower complexity hypothesis class relative to the expert policy, and (ii) the ground-truth IDM is often less stochastic than the expert policy. We argue these claims based on insights from statistical learning theory and novel experiments, including a study of IDM-based policies using recent architectures for unified video-action prediction (UVA). Motivated by these insights, we finally propose an improved version of the existing LAPO algorithm for latent action policy learning."}

In contrast to single-objective misclassification attacks that disrupt explanation and spread attribution mass broadly, TSEF achieves targeted prediction changes while keeping explanations consistent with the reference.

Flattening fails to preserve temporal coherence even when it maintains valid marginal distributions. We introduce PATH, a novel generative framework that treats the full table as the unit of synthesis and leverages the autoregressive capabilities of privately fine-tuned large language models. Extensive evaluations show that PATH effectively captures long-range dependencies that traditional methods miss. Empirically, our method reduces the distributional distance to real trajectories by over 60% and reduces state transition errors by nearly 50% compared to leading marginal mechanisms while achieving similar marginal fidelity."}

A core challenge in this setting is catastrophic forgetting, where new learning interferes with past knowledge. Among various mitigation strategies, data-replay methods, where past samples are periodically revisited, are considered simple yet effective, especially when memory constraints are relaxed. However, the theoretical effectiveness of full data replay, where all past data is accessible during training, remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we present a comprehensive theoretical framework for analyzing full data-replay training in continual learning from a feature learning perspective. Adopting a multi-view data model, we identify the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) as a critical factor affecting forgetting. Focusing on task-incremental binary classification across $M$ tasks, our analysis verifies two key conclusions: (1) forgetting can still occur under full replay when the cumulative noise from later tasks dominates the signal from earlier ones; and (2) with sufficient signal accumulation, data replay can recover earlier tasks-even if their initial learning was poor. Notably, we uncover a novel insight into task ordering: prioritizing higher-signal tasks not only facilitates learning of lower-signal tasks but also helps prevent catastrophic forgetting. We validate our theoretical findings through synthetic and real-world experiments that visualize the interplay between signal learning and noise memorization across varying SNRs and task correlation regimes."}

We then adopt embedding-based deep learning models (ArcFace), first on features and then on ECG waveforms, showing a performance jump when moving from tabular inputs to waveforms, and a further gain with larger training sets and consistent normalization across train/val/test.

To address this gap, we frame MIA evaluation as a causal inference problem, defining memorization as the causal effect of including a data point in the training set. This novel formulation reveals and formalizes key sources of bias in existing protocols: one-run methods suffer from interference between jointly included points, while zero-run evaluations popular for LLMs are confounded by non-random membership assignment.

This slows training, reduces accuracy, and hurts generalization. To address these problems, we propose Continuous Number Modeling (CNM), an approach that directly models numbers as first-class, continuous values rather than discrete tokens. This formulation restores the mathematical elegance of the representation by aligning the model's inputs with the data's continuous nature, removing discretization artifacts introduced by token-based encoding.

We ask: can we enable traces to \"peer-review\" each other to resolve these near-miss errors?\n  We introduce Packet-Conditioned Revision (PACER), a training-free, inference-only framework that enables reasoning traces to revise their conclusions through a structured coordination step. After a preliminary screening of generated traces, PACER constructs a compact consensus packet containing (i) unique candidate answers, (ii) their aggregated confidence scores, and (iii) representative reasoning summaries for each candidate answer. Individual traces then perform a targeted self-review conditioned on this packet, allowing them to identify specific logical junctions where they diverged from the broader consensus and pivot if their original reasoning is found to be flawed. Final predictions are obtained via confidence-weighted voting over these revised trajectories.

These algorithms build on standard policy gradients, which assume that there is no unmeasured confounding in the data. However, this condition does not necessarily hold for pixel-based demonstrations when a mismatch exists between the demonstrator's and the learner's sensory capabilities, leading to implicit confounding biases in offline data. We address the challenge by investigating the problem of confounded observations in offline RL from a causal perspective. We develop a novel causal offline RL objective that optimizes policies' worst-case performance that may arise due to confounding biases. Based on this new objective, we introduce a practical implementation that learns expressive flow-matching policies from confounded demonstrations, employing a deep discriminator to assess the discrepancy between the target policy and the nominal behavioral policy. Experiments across 25 pixel-based tasks demonstrate that our proposed confounding-robust augmentation procedure achieves a success rate 120\\% that of confounding-unaware, state-of-the-art offline RL methods."}

We propose Recurrent Equivariant Constraint Modulation (RECM), a layer-wise constraint modulation mechanism that learns appropriate relaxation levels solely from the training signal and the symmetry properties of each layer's input-target distribution, without requiring any prior knowledge about the task-dependent target relaxation level. We demonstrate that under the proposed RECM update, the relaxation level of each layer provably converges to a value upper-bounded by its symmetry gap, namely the degree to which its input-target distribution deviates from exact symmetry. Consequently, layers processing symmetric distributions recover full equivariance, while those with approximate symmetries retain sufficient flexibility to learn non-symmetric solutions when warranted by the data. Empirically, RECM outperforms prior methods across diverse exact and approximate equivariant tasks, including the challenging molecular conformer generation on the GEOM-Drugs dataset."}

Leveraging a summary statistics description of the fine-tuning dynamics, we precisely characterize how the convergence rate depends on the initial fine-tuning alignment and the degree of non-linearity of the target task. The key take away is that even when the pre-training and down- stream tasks are well aligned, strong pre-training can induce a prolonged search phase and hinder convergence. Our theory thus provides a unified picture of how pre-training strength and task difficulty jointly shape the dynamics and limitations of LoRA fine-tuning in a nontrivial tractable model."}

We identify a previously unreported third phase of grokking in this training regime: \\emph{anti-grokking}, a late-stage collapse of generalization.\n  We revisit two canonical grokking setups: a 3-layer MLP trained on a subset of MNIST and a transformer trained on modular addition, but extended training far beyond standard. In both cases, after models transition from pre-grokking to successful generalization, test accuracy collapses back to chance while training accuracy remains perfect, indicating a distinct post-generalization failure mode.\n  To diagnose anti-grokking, we use the open-source \\texttt{WeightWatcher} tool based on HTSR/SETOL theory. The primary signal is the emergence of \\emph{Correlation Traps}: anomalously large eigenvalues beyond the Marchenko--Pastur bulk in the empirical spectral density of shuffled weight matrices, which are predicted to impair generalization. As a secondary signal, anti-grokking corresponds to the average HTSR layer quality metric $α$ deviating from $2.0$. Neither metric requires access to the test or training data.\n  We compare these signals to alternative grokking diagnostic, including $\\ell_2$ norms, Activation Sparsity, Absolute Weight Entropy, and Local Circuit Complexity.

While entropic risk objectives of this form arise in many machine learning problems, existing optimization algorithms suffer from several fundamental limitations including non-convergence, numerical instability, and slow convergence rates. To address these limitations, we propose a geometry-aware stochastic algorithm, termed $\\textbf{SCENT}$, for the dual formulation of entropic risk minimization cast as a min--min optimization problem.

We investigate this region by instantiating two novel models: Linear M-CBE, which learns a finite set of linear expressions, and Symbolic M-CBE, which leverages symbolic regression to discover expert functions from data under user-specified operator vocabularies.

Training-aware structured pruning addresses global dependencies, but its computational cost can be just as expensive as post-pruning training. To alleviate the computational burden of training-aware pruning and capture global structural dependencies, we propose TraceNAS, a training-free Neural Architecture Search (NAS) framework that jointly explores structured pruning of LLM depth and width. TraceNAS identifies pruned models that maintain a high degree of loss landscape alignment with the pretrained model using a scale-invariant zero-shot proxy, effectively selecting models that exhibit maximal performance potential during post-pruning training. TraceNAS is highly efficient, enabling high-fidelity discovery of pruned models on a single GPU in 8.5 hours, yielding a 10$\\times$ reduction in GPU-hours compared to training-aware methods. Evaluations on the Llama and Qwen families demonstrate that TraceNAS is competitive with training-aware baselines across commonsense and reasoning benchmarks."}

We prove that these errors are not random noise but systematically align with the dominant Hessian subspace, acting as structured perturbations that guide optimization toward flatter minima. Across image classification and machine translation benchmarks, DSGD-AC consistently surpasses both standard DSGD and centralized SGD in test accuracy and solution flatness.

MC-ETM learns a latent manifold of next states and generates near-manifold hard negatives by perturbing latent codes and running Langevin dynamics in latent space with the learned conditional energy, sharpening the energy landscape around the dataset support and improving sensitivity to subtle out-of-distribution deviations. For policy optimization, the learned energy provides a single reliability signal: rollouts are truncated when the minimum energy over sampled next states exceeds a threshold, and Bellman backups are stabilized via pessimistic penalties based on Q-value-level dispersion across energy-guided samples. We formalize MC-ETM through a hybrid pessimistic MDP formulation and derive a conservative performance bound separating in-support evaluation error from truncation risk. Empirically, MC-ETM improves multi-step dynamics fidelity and yields higher normalized returns on standard offline control benchmarks, particularly under irregular dynamics and sparse data coverage."}

We trace this consistency to a simple linear effect: the shared Gaussian statistics across splits already predict much of the generated images. To formalize this, we develop a random matrix theory (RMT) framework that quantifies how finite datasets shape the expectation and variance of the learned denoiser and sampling map in the linear setting. For expectations, sampling variability acts as a renormalization of the noise level through a self-consistent relation $σ^2 \\mapsto κ(σ^2)$, explaining why limited data overshrink low-variance directions and pull samples toward the dataset mean. For fluctuations, our variance formulas reveal three key factors behind cross-split disagreement: \\textit{anisotropy} across eigenmodes, \\textit{inhomogeneity} across inputs, and overall scaling with dataset size. Extending deterministic-equivalence tools to fractional matrix powers further allows us to analyze entire sampling trajectories. The theory sharply predicts the behavior of linear diffusion models, and we validate its predictions on UNet and DiT architectures in their non-memorization regime, identifying where and how samples deviates across training data split. This provides a principled baseline for reproducibility in diffusion training, linking spectral properties of data to the stability of generative outputs."}

We study the special case where a KL-regularized soft update is exactly a Bayesian posterior inside a single fixed probabilistic model, so the update variable is a genuine channel through which information is transmitted. In this regime, behavioral change is driven only by evidence carried by that channel: the update must be explainable as an evidence reweighing of the baseline. This yields a sharp identification result: posterior updates determine the relative, context-dependent incentive signal that shifts behavior, but they do not uniquely determine absolute rewards, which remain ambiguous up to context-specific baselines. Requiring one reusable continuation value across different update directions adds a further coherence constraint linking the reward descriptions associated with different conditioning orders."}

By revisiting optimization theory and energy-based model, we show that the instability of primal-dual methods arises from the non-convex Lagrangian landscape. In diffusion-based safe RL, the Lagrangian can be interpreted as an energy function guiding the denoising dynamics. Counterintuitively, direct usage destabilizes both policy generation and training.

In this paper, we introduce SDA2E, a Sparse Dual Adversarial Attention-based AutoEncoder designed to learn compact and discriminative latent representations from imbalanced, high-dimensional data. We further propose a similarity-guided active learning framework that integrates three novel strategies to refine decision boundaries efficiently: mormal-like expansion, which enriches the training set with points similar to labeled normals to improve reconstruction fidelity; anomaly-like prioritization, which boosts ranking accuracy by focusing on points resembling known anomalies; and a hybrid strategy that combines both for balanced model refinement and ranking. A key component of our framework is a new similarity measure, Normalized Matching 1s (SIM_NM1), tailored for sparse binary embeddings. We evaluate SDA2E extensively across 52 imbalanced datasets, including multiple DARPA Transparent Computing scenarios, and benchmark it against 15 state-of-the-art anomaly detection methods. Results demonstrate that SDA2E consistently achieves superior ranking performance (nDCG up to 1.0 in several cases) while reducing the required labeled data by up to 80% compared to passive training.

Furthermore, we frame early detection of post-trauma sepsis onset according to clinical workflow in ICUs in a daily basis resulting in a new rare event detection problem. We then establish a general benchmark through comprehensive experiments, which shows the necessity of further advancements using this new dataset.

However, these ML predictors are often vulnerable to out-of-distribution (OOD) samples at test time, leading to significant decision performance degradation due to large prediction errors. To address the generalization challenges under OOD conditions, we present the framework of Distributionally Robust Decision-Focused Learning (DR-DFL), which trains ML models to optimize decision performance under the worst-case distribution. Instead of relying on classical Distributionally Robust Optimization (DRO) techniques, we propose Diffusion-Augmented Distributionally Robust Decision-Focused Learning (3D-Learning), which searches for the worst-case distribution within the parameterized space of a diffusion model. By leveraging the powerful distribution modeling capabilities of diffusion models, 3D-Learning identifies worst-case distributions that remain consistent with real data, achieving a favorable balance between average and worst-case scenarios. Empirical results on an LLM resource provisioning task demonstrate that 3D-Learning outperforms existing DRO and Data Augmentation methods in OOD generalization performance."}

The architecture pairs a standard VAE encoding observations with a sparse VAE encoding quantities of interest, connected through a learned latent mapping. The variational structure enables uncertainty estimation, the paired architecture encourages interpretability by anchoring QoI representations to clean data, and sparse encodings provide structure by concentrating information into identifiable factors rather than diffusing across all dimensions. We also propose modifications to existing sparse VAE methods: a hard-concrete spike-and-slab relaxation for differentiable training and a beta hyperprior for adaptive sparsity levels.

Our key contribution is an action-branching discrete control formulation that decomposes corridor control into (i) local, per-intersection actions that allocate green time between the next two phases and (ii) a single global action that selects the total duration of those phases. This decomposition enables scalable coordination under discrete control while reducing the effective complexity of joint decision-making.

However, most progress in unlearning has been empirical, with little theoretical understanding of when and why unlearning works. We tackle this gap by framing unlearning through the lens of asymptotic linear stability to capture the interaction between optimization dynamics and data geometry. The key quantity in our analysis is data coherence which is the cross sample alignment of loss surface directions near the optimum. We decompose coherence along three axes: within the retain set, within the forget set, and between them, and prove tight stability thresholds that separate convergence from divergence. To further link data properties to forgettability, we study a two layer ReLU CNN under a signal plus noise model and show that stronger memorization makes forgetting easier: when the signal to noise ratio (SNR) is lower, cross sample alignment is weaker, reducing coherence and making unlearning easier; conversely, high SNR, highly aligned models resist unlearning. For empirical verification, we show that Hessian tests and CNN heatmaps align closely with the predicted boundary, mapping the stability frontier of gradient based unlearning as a function of batching, mixing, and data/model alignment. Our analysis is grounded in random matrix theory tools and provides the first principled account of the trade offs between memorization, coherence, and unlearning."}

As a privacy-preserving framework to leverage decentralized data for collaborative model training, Federated Learning (FL) is gaining popularity in LLM fine-tuning, but remains challenging due to the high cost of transmitting full model parameters and computing full gradients on resource-constrained clients. While Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods are widely used in FL to reduce communication and memory costs, they often sacrifice model performance compared to FFT. This paper proposes FedKRSO (Federated $K$-Seed Random Subspace Optimization), a novel method that enables communication and memory efficient FFT of LLMs in federated settings. In FedKRSO, clients update the model within a shared set of random low-dimension subspaces generated by the server to save memory usage. Furthermore, instead of transmitting full model parameters in each FL round, clients send only the model update accumulators along the subspaces to the server, enabling efficient global model aggregation and dissemination. By using these strategies, FedKRSO can substantially reduce communication and memory overhead while overcoming the performance limitations of PEFT, closely approximating the performance of federated FFT. The convergence properties of FedKRSO are analyzed rigorously under general FL settings. Extensive experiments on the GLUE benchmark across diverse FL scenarios demonstrate that FedKRSO achieves both superior performance and low communication and memory overhead, paving the way towards on federated LLM fine-tuning at the resource-constrained edge."}

We leverage this observation to design a statistically efficient evaluation framework that combines standard labeled outcomes with pairwise comparison signals obtained by having models judge auxiliary reasoning chains. Treating these comparison signals as control variates, we develop a semiparametric estimator based on the efficient influence function (EIF) for the setting where auxiliary reasoning chains are observed.

In a case where the majority of training data are dominated by a certain feature, neural networks prefer to learn such a feature even if the feature is not generalizable outside the training set. Based on the framework of Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK), we analyzed the case of linear neural networks to derive some important properties of shortcut learning. We defined a feature of a neural network as an eigenfunction of NTK. Then, we found that shortcut features correspond to features with larger eigenvalues when the shortcuts stem from the imbalanced number of samples in the clustered distribution. We also showed that the features with larger eigenvalues still have a large influence on the neural network output even after training, due to data variances in the clusters. Such a preference for certain features remains even when a margin of a neural network output is controlled, which shows that the max-margin bias is not the only major reason for shortcut learning.

While RL generally preserves broader model capabilities (retention) better than SFT, it comes with significant costs: complex reward engineering, instability, and expensive on-policy sampling. In contrast, SFT is efficient but brittle, often suffering from catastrophic forgetting due to $\\textbf{Supervision Mismatch}$: the divergence between the model's evolving policy and static training labels. We address this trade-off with $\\textbf{Trajectory-Mixed Supervision (TMS)}$, a reward-free framework that approximates the on-policy benefits of RL by creating a dynamic curriculum from the model's own historical checkpoints. TMS minimizes $\\textit{Policy-Label Divergence (PLD)}$, preventing the mode collapse that drives forgetting in standard SFT.

To address this, we unify these problems under a single framework, which enables the design of a general neural solver. Building on this unified view, we propose Neural Predictor-Corrector (NPC), which replaces hand-crafted heuristics with automatically learned policies. NPC formulates policy selection as a sequential decision-making problem and leverages reinforcement learning to automatically discover efficient strategies. To further enhance generalization, we introduce an amortized training mechanism, enabling one-time offline training for a class of problems and efficient online inference on new instances. Experiments on four representative homotopy problems demonstrate that our method generalizes effectively to unseen instances.

Standard fine-tuning paradigms, including Reinforcement Learning (RL), fundamentally rely on backpropagation and high-precision weights to compute gradients. Thus they cannot be used on quantized models, where the parameter space is discrete and non-differentiable. While Evolution Strategies (ES) offer a backpropagation-free alternative, optimization of the quantized parameters can still fail due to vanishing or inaccurate gradient. This paper introduces Quantized Evolution Strategies (QES), an optimization paradigm that performs full-parameter fine-tuning directly in the quantized space. QES is based on two innovations: (1) it integrates accumulated error feedback to preserve high-precision gradient signals, and (2) it utilizes a stateless seed replay to reduce memory usage to low-precision inference levels. QES significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art zeroth-order fine-tuning method on arithmetic reasoning tasks, making direct fine-tuning for quantized models possible. It therefore opens up the possibility for scaling up LLMs entirely in the quantized space. The source code is available at https://github.com/dibbla/Quantized-Evolution-Strategies ."}

Here, we introduce Contrastive Concept-Tree Search (CCTS), which extracts a hierarchical concept representation from the generated programs and learns a contrastive concept model that guides parent selection. By reweighting parents using a likelihood-ratio score between high- and low-performing solutions, CCTS biases search toward useful concept combinations and away from misleading ones, providing guidance through an explicit concept hierarchy rather than the algorithm lineage constructed by the LLM. We show that CCTS improves search efficiency over fitness-based baselines and produces interpretable, task-specific concept trees across a benchmark of open Erdős-type combinatorics problems. Our analysis indicates that the gains are driven largely by learning which concepts to avoid.

However, under sparse terminal rewards, GRPO often stalls because rollouts within a group frequently receive identical rewards, causing relative advantages to collapse and updates to vanish. We propose self-hint aligned GRPO with privileged supervision (SAGE), an on-policy reinforcement learning framework that injects privileged hints during training to reshape the rollout distribution under the same terminal verifier reward. For each prompt $x$, the model samples a compact hint $h$ (e.g., a plan or decomposition) and then generates a solution $τ$ conditioned on $(x,h)$. Crucially, the task reward $R(x,τ)$ is unchanged; hints only increase within-group outcome diversity under finite sampling, preventing GRPO advantages from collapsing under sparse rewards. At test time, we set $h=\\varnothing$ and deploy the no-hint policy without any privileged information. Moreover, sampling diverse self-hints serves as an adaptive curriculum that tracks the learner's bottlenecks more effectively than fixed hints from an initial policy or a stronger external model. Experiments over 6 benchmarks with 3 LLMs show that SAGE consistently outperforms GRPO, on average +2.0 on Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct, +1.2 on Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct and +1.3 on Qwen3-4B-Instruct.

Novel visual categories were embedded along a one-dimensional morph continuum using pretrained vision models, and selection strategies varied in their emphasis on prototypicality, joint representativeness, and diversity. Adult participants selected one to three exemplars to teach a learner. Model-human comparisons revealed that strategies based on joint representativeness, or its combination with diversity, best captured human judgments, whereas purely prototypical or diversity-based strategies performed worse. Moreover, transformer-based representations consistently aligned more closely with human behavior than convolutional networks.

Specifically, we learn experience from the training set and organize it into a hierarchical memory. This is achieved by summarizing prediction results into historical patterns, distilling inference trajectories into reasoning wisdom, and inducing extracted temporal features into general laws. Furthermore, during inference, we leverage historical patterns to guide the reasoning process and utilize reasoning wisdom to select better trajectories, while general laws serve as criteria for reflective iteration. Additionally, to enable continual evolution, we design a dynamic confidence adaptation strategy that updates the confidence of individual entries without leaking the test set distribution.

We observe that rigid splitting suffers from significant accuracy degradation (ranging from 5.5% to 55.1%) across different scenarios, owing to the scenario-dependent nature of the semantic boundaries. This highlights the necessity of dynamic semantic splitting to match semantics. To achieve this, we face two challenges.

As a result, most existing approaches restrict training to short horizons (typically 5-20 epochs), limiting sustained exploration and hindering further policy improvement. In addition, nearly all prior work relies on a single, fixed reasoning prompt or template during training. In this work, we introduce prompt augmentation, a training strategy that instructs the model to generate reasoning traces under diverse templates and formats, thereby increasing rollout diversity.

Building on this insight, we propose Spectral Evolution Search (SES), a plug-and-play framework for initial noise optimization that executes gradient-free evolutionary search within a low-frequency subspace. Theoretically, we derive the Spectral Scaling Prediction from perturbation propagation dynamics, which explains the systematic differences in the impact of perturbations across frequencies. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SES significantly advances the Pareto frontier of generation quality versus computational cost, consistently outperforming strong baselines under equivalent budgets."}

This paper studies a test-time scaling method that enables sampling from regions with higher human-aligned reward values. Existing gradient guidance methods approximate the expected future reward (EFR) at an intermediate particle $\\mathbf{x}_t$ using a Taylor approximation, but this approximation at each time step incurs high computational cost due to sequential neural backpropagation. We show that the EFR at any $\\mathbf{x}_t$ can be computed using only marginal samples from a pre-trained diffusion model. The proposed EFR formulation detaches the neural dependency between $\\mathbf{x}_t$ and the EFR, enabling closed-form guidance computation without neural backpropagation. To further improve efficiency, we introduce lookahead sampling to collect marginal samples. For final sample generation, we use an accurate solver that guides particles toward high-reward lookahead samples. We refer to this sampling scheme as LiDAR sampling. LiDAR achieves substantial performance improvements using only three samples with a 3-step lookahead solver, exhibiting steep performance gains as lookahead accuracy and sample count increase; notably, it reaches the same GenEval performance as the latest gradient guidance method for SDXL with a 9.5x speedup."}

Remarkably, ARM requires only early SFT checkpoints and, through iterative merging, surpasses the fully converged SFT model. Experimental results across model scales (1.7B to 14B) and diverse domains (e.g., math, code) demonstrate that ARM can transcend converged checkpoints.

To address this, we propose a novel detection framework based on Toxicity Association Graphs (TAGs), which systematically model semantic associations between innocuous entities and latent toxic implications. Leveraging TAGs, we introduce the first quantifiable metric for hidden toxicity, the Multimodal Toxicity Covertness (MTC), which measures the degree of concealment in toxic multimodal expressions. By integrating our detection framework with the MTC metric, our approach enables precise identification of covert toxicity while preserving full interpretability of the decision-making process, significantly enhancing transparency in multimodal toxicity detection.

Existing unsupervised anomaly detection algorithms rarely perform well across different anomaly types, often excelling only under specific structural assumptions. This lack of robustness also becomes particularly evident under noisy settings. We propose Mean Shift Density Enhancement (MSDE), a fully unsupervised framework that detects anomalies through their geometric response to density-driven manifold evolution. MSDE is based on the principle that normal samples, being well supported by local density, remain stable under iterative density enhancement, whereas anomalous samples undergo large cumulative displacements as they are attracted toward nearby density modes. To operationalize this idea, MSDE employs a weighted mean-shift procedure with adaptive, sample-specific density weights derived from a UMAP-based fuzzy neighborhood graph. Anomaly scores are defined by the total displacement accumulated across a small number of mean-shift iterations. We evaluate MSDE on the ADBench benchmark, comprising forty six real-world tabular datasets, four realistic anomaly generation mechanisms, and six noise levels. Compared to 13 established unsupervised baselines, MSDE achieves consistently strong, balanced and robust performance for AUC-ROC, AUC-PR, and Precision@n, at several noise levels and on average over several types of anomalies. These results demonstrate that displacement-based scoring provides a robust alternative to the existing state-of-the-art for unsupervised anomaly detection."}

However, as models often learn tasks in a similar order, we hypothesize that easier tasks will be easier regardless of how they are presented to the model. Indeed, in this paper, we show that as models approach high performance on a task, robustness is effectively achieved. Through an empirical analysis of multiple models across diverse datasets and configurations (e.g., paraphrases, different temperatures), we find a strong positive correlation. Moreover, we find that robustness is primarily driven by task-specific competence rather than inherent model-level properties, challenging current approaches that treat robustness as an independent capability. Thus, from a high-level perspective, we may expect that as new tasks saturate, model robustness on these tasks will emerge accordingly. For researchers, this implies that explicit efforts to measure and improve robustness may warrant reduced emphasis, as such robustness is likely to develop alongside performance gains.

Under standard assumptions, including smooth local losses, weak convexity of the regularizer, and bounded stochastic gradient variance, FedNMap achieves linear speedup with respect to both the number of clients $n$ and the number of local updates $Q$ for nonconvex losses, both with and without the Polyak-Łojasiewicz (PL) condition. To our knowledge, this is the first result establishing linear speedup for nonconvex composite federated learning."}

However, these strategies are impractical for edge device deployment due to limited RAM and NPU resources. Despite hardware constraints, deploying performant LLM on edge devices such as smartphone remains crucial for user experience. To address this, we propose MeKi (Memory-based Expert Knowledge Injection), a novel system that scales LLM capacity via storage space rather than FLOPs. MeKi equips each Transformer layer with token-level memory experts that injects pre-stored semantic knowledge into the generation process. To bridge the gap between training capacity and inference efficiency, we employ a re-parameterization strategy to fold parameter matrices used during training into a compact static lookup table. By offloading the knowledge to ROM, MeKi decouples model capacity from computational cost, introducing zero inference latency overhead. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MeKi significantly outperforms dense LLM baselines with identical inference speed, validating the effectiveness of memory-based scaling paradigm for on-device LLMs. Project homepage is at https://github.com/ningding-o/MeKi."}

However, the phenomenon of benign relearning, in which forgotten information reemerges even from benign fine-tuning data, reveals that existing unlearning methods remain fundamentally fragile. A common explanation attributes this effect to topical relevance, but we find this account insufficient. Through systematic analysis, we demonstrate that syntactic similarity, rather than topicality, is the primary driver: across benchmarks, syntactically similar data consistently trigger recovery even without topical overlap, due to their alignment in representations and gradients with the forgotten content. Motivated by this insight, we introduce syntactic diversification, which paraphrases the original forget queries into heterogeneous structures prior to unlearning. This approach effectively suppresses benign relearning, accelerates forgetting, and substantially alleviates the trade-off between unlearning efficacy and model utility."}

However, DL struggles to train a high accuracy model when the data distribution is non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) and when the communication topology is static. To address these issues, we propose Morph, a topology optimization algorithm for DL. In Morph, nodes adaptively choose peers for model exchange based on maximum model dissimilarity. Morph maintains a fixed in-degree while dynamically reshaping the communication graph through gossip-based peer discovery and diversity-driven neighbor selection, thereby improving robustness to data heterogeneity. Experiments on CIFAR-10 and FEMNIST with up to 100 nodes show that Morph consistently outperforms static and epidemic baselines, while closely tracking the fully connected upper bound. On CIFAR-10, Morph achieves a relative improvement of 1.12x in test accuracy compared to the state-of-the-art baselines. On FEMNIST, Morph achieves an accuracy that is 1.08x higher than Epidemic Learning. Similar trends hold for 50 node deployments, where Morph narrows the gap to the fully connected upper bound within 0.5 percentage points on CIFAR-10. These results demonstrate that Morph achieves higher final accuracy, faster convergence, and more stable learning as quantified by lower inter-node variance, while requiring fewer communication rounds than baselines and no global knowledge."}

We show how to control the bias accumulated by the surrogate gradients and use techniques from random reshuffling to prove a convergence theorem for PPO that sheds light on PPO's success.

While hierarchical approaches mitigate this issue by decomposing tasks, most existing methods rely on separate high- and low-level networks and generate only a single intermediate subgoal, making them inadequate for complex tasks that require coordinating multiple intermediate decisions. To address this limitation, we draw inspiration from the chain-of-thought paradigm and propose the Chain-of-Goals Hierarchical Policy (CoGHP), a novel framework that reformulates hierarchical decision-making as autoregressive sequence modeling within a unified architecture. Given a state and a final goal, CoGHP autoregressively generates a sequence of latent subgoals followed by the primitive action, where each latent subgoal acts as a reasoning step that conditions subsequent predictions. To implement this efficiently, we pioneer the use of an MLP-Mixer backbone, which supports cross-token communication and captures structural relationships among state, goal, latent subgoals, and action. Across challenging navigation and manipulation benchmarks, CoGHP consistently outperforms strong offline baselines, demonstrating improved performance on long-horizon tasks."}

While recent studies increasingly focus on monitoring and adjusting entropy to better balance exploration and exploitation in reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT), a principled understanding of entropy dynamics during this process is yet to be thoroughly investigated. In this paper, we establish a theoretical framework for analyzing the entropy dynamics during the RFT process, which begins with a discriminant expression that quantifies entropy change under a single logit update. This foundation enables the derivation of a first-order expression for entropy change, which can be further extended to the update formula of Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). The corollaries and insights drawn from the theoretical analysis inspire the design of entropy control methods, and also offer a unified lens for interpreting various entropy-based methods in existing studies. We provide empirical evidence to support the main conclusions of our analysis and demonstrate the effectiveness of the derived entropy-discriminator clipping methods. This study yields novel insights into RFT training dynamics, providing theoretical support and practical strategies for optimizing the exploration-exploitation balance during LLM fine-tuning."}

We theoretically ground this phenomenon in a dynamic signal-noise trade-off, demonstrating that generalization hinges on the competition between marginal signal realization and noise accumulation. To operationalize this insight, we propose a bi-level optimization framework that autonomously identifies the optimal proxy label within a single training run.

Prior work shows RLVR works with few prompts, but prompt selection is often based only on training-accuracy variance, leading to unstable optimization directions and weaker transfer. We revisit prompt selection from a mechanism-level view and argue that an effective minibatch should provide both (i) a reliable positive anchor and (ii) explicit negative learning signals from rare failures. Based on this principle, we propose \\emph{positive--negative pairing}: at each update, we sample a hard-but-solvable $q^{+}$ and an easy-but-brittle prompt $q^{-}$(high success rate but not perfect), characterized by low and high empirical success rates under multiple rollouts. We further introduce Weighted GRPO, which reweights binary outcomes at the pair level and uses group-normalized advantages to amplify rare successes on $q^{+}$ into sharp positive guidance while turning rare failures on $q^{-}$ into strong negative penalties. This bidirectional signal provides informative learning feedback for both successes and failures, improving sample efficiency without suppressing exploration. On Qwen2.5-Math-7B, a single paired minibatch per update consistently outperforms a GRPO baseline that selects two prompts via commonly used variance-based selection heuristics: AIME~2025 Pass@8 improves from 16.8 to 22.2, and AMC23 Pass@64 from 94.0 to 97.0, while remaining competitive with large-scale RLVR trained from a pool of 1209 training prompts.

To overcome this difficulty, existing methods typically impose an exposure mapping that compresses the treatment assignments in the network into a low-dimensional summary. However, if this mapping is misspecified, standard estimators for direct and spillover effects can be severely biased. We propose a novel partial identification framework for causal inference on networks to assess the robustness of treatment effects under misspecifications of the exposure mapping. Specifically, we derive sharp upper and lower bounds on direct and spillover effects under such misspecifications. As such, our framework presents a novel application of causal sensitivity analysis to exposure mappings. We instantiate our framework for three canonical exposure settings widely used in practice: (i) weighted means of the neighborhood treatments, (ii) threshold-based exposure mappings, and (iii) truncated neighborhood interference in the presence of higher-order spillovers. Furthermore, we develop orthogonal estimators for these bounds and prove that the resulting bound estimates are valid, sharp, and efficient. Our experiments show the bounds remain informative and provide reliable conclusions under misspecification of exposure mappings."}

This construction guarantees strict feasibility while preserving a full-rank Jacobian almost everywhere, thereby preventing the optimization stalls typical of boundary-based methods.

However, this efficiency gain can be compromised by gradient staleness, where the immediate model updates with delayed gradients introduce noise into the optimization process. Crucially, we identify a critical, yet often overlooked, pathology: this delay scales linearly with pipeline depth, fundamentally undermining the very scalability that the method originally intends to provide. In this work, we investigate this inconsistency and bridge the gap by rectifying delayed gradients through basis rotation, restoring scalable asynchronous training while maintaining performance. Specifically, we observe that the deleterious effects of delayed gradients are exacerbated when the Hessian eigenbasis is misaligned with the standard coordinate basis. We demonstrate that this misalignment prevents coordinate-wise adaptive schemes, such as Adam, from effectively leveraging curvature-aware adaptivity. This failure leads to significant oscillations in the optimization trajectory and, consequently, slower convergence. We substantiate these findings through both rigorous theoretical analysis and empirical evaluation. To address this challenge, we propose the use of basis rotation, demonstrating that it effectively mitigates the alignment issue and significantly accelerates convergence in asynchronous settings. For example, our training of a 1B-parameter LLM with basis rotation achieves the same training loss in 76.8% fewer iterations compared to the best-performing asynchronous pipeline parallel training baseline."}

PNS trains a dedicated model via reverse reinforcement learning (RL) guided by a composite reward combining format compliance, accuracy inversion, reward model assessment, and chain-of-thought evaluation, generating responses nearly indistinguishable from correct solutions. We further validate PNS as a plug-and-play data source for preference optimization across three backbone models on seven mathematical reasoning benchmarks. Results demonstrate that PNS consistently outperforms other negative sample synthesis methods, achieving an average improvement of 2.03% over RL-trained models."}

Examples include prioritizing patients for preventive care interventions, or ranking customers by the expected incremental impact of an advertisement. Surprisingly, while causal effect estimation has received substantial attention in the literature, the problem of directly learning rankings of treatment effects has largely remained unexplored. In this paper, we introduce Rank-Learner, a novel two-stage learner that directly learns the ranking of treatment effects from observational data. We first show that naive approaches based on precise treatment effect estimation solve a harder problem than necessary for ranking, while our Rank-Learner optimizes a pairwise learning objective that recovers the true treatment effect ordering, without explicit CATE estimation. We further show that our Rank-Learner is Neyman-orthogonal and thus comes with strong theoretical guarantees, including robustness to estimation errors in the nuisance functions. In addition, our Rank-Learner is model-agnostic, and can be instantiated with arbitrary machine learning models (e.g., neural networks). We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through extensive experiments where Rank-Learner consistently outperforms standard CATE estimators and non-orthogonal ranking methods. Overall, we provide practitioners with a new, orthogonal two-stage learner for ranking individuals by their treatment effects."}

However, it faces severe risks arising from sparse, coordinated malicious behaviors among multiple participants, which are often concealed within normal activities and challenging to detect timely and accurately. In this work, we provide a pioneering study on risk assessment in live streaming rooms, characterized by weak supervision where only room-level labels are available. We formulate the task as a Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) problem, treating each room as a bag and defining structured user-timeslot capsules as instances. These capsules represent subsequences of user actions within specific time windows, encapsulating localized behavioral patterns. Based on this formulation, we propose AC-MIL, an Action-aware Capsule MIL framework that models both individual behaviors and group-level coordination patterns. AC-MIL captures multi-granular semantics and behavioral cues through a serial and parallel architecture that jointly encodes temporal dynamics and cross-user dependencies. These signals are integrated for robust room-level risk prediction, while also offering interpretable evidence at the behavior segment level. Extensive experiments on large-scale industrial datasets from Douyin demonstrate that AC-MIL significantly outperforms MIL and sequential baselines, establishing new state-of-the-art performance in room-level risk assessment for live streaming. Moreover, AC-MIL provides capsule-level interpretability, enabling identification of risky behavior segments as actionable evidence for intervention.

We show that WARP yields the most parameter-efficient representation for exactly learning Boolean functions and that several prior approaches arise as restricted special cases. Training is improved by introducing learnable thresholding and residual initialization, while we bridge the gap between relaxed training and discrete logic inference through stochastic smoothing.

Through layer-wise analysis of token embeddings, we show that pretrained MAE progressively constructs its latent space in a class-aware manner across network depth: embeddings from different classes lie in subspaces that become increasingly separable. We further observe that MAE exhibits early and persistent global attention across encoder layers, in contrast to standard Vision Transformers (ViTs). To quantify feature robustness, we introduce two sensitivity indicators: directional alignment between clean and perturbed embeddings, and head-wise retention of active features under degradations. These studies help establish the robust classification performance of MAEs."}

In particular, the initial MatQuant relies on expensive quantization-aware training (QAT) variants, rather than fast one-shot post training quantization (PTQ), and lacks open-source and kernel support. We address all of these limitations by introducing Post-Training Matryoshka Quantization (MatGPTQ), a new PTQ pipeline that produces a single parent model jointly optimized for multiple target precisions in one-shot, based on a small calibration set. MatGPTQ casts Matryoshka quantization as a multi-precision objective with bit-slicing and cross-bit error compensation, resulting in an algorithm that produces a multi-bit-width, \"sliceable\" model in a single pass. We also incorporate a new budget-aware search for heterogeneous per-layer bit-witdhs and provide efficient kernels that implement slicing and mixed-precision execution. Across standard LLMs and benchmarks, MatGPTQ preserves high-bit accuracy while substantially improving performance at low-bit-witdh settings.

In this work, we propose CoGenCast, a hybrid generative framework that couples pre-trained LLMs with flow-matching mechanism for effective time series forecasting.

In this paper, we prove that any method for OT on manifolds that produces discrete approximations of transport maps necessarily suffers from the curse of dimensionality: achieving a fixed accuracy requires a number of parameters that grows exponentially with the manifold dimension. Motivated by this limitation, we introduce Riemannian Neural OT (RNOT) maps, which are continuous neural-network parameterizations of OT maps on manifolds that avoid discretization and incorporate geometric structure by construction. Under mild regularity assumptions, we prove that RNOT maps approximate Riemannian OT maps with sub-exponential complexity in the dimension.

Some existing approaches propose unlearning verification methods based on backdooring techniques. However, these methods typically require participation in the model's initial training phase to backdoor the model for later verification, which is inefficient and impractical. In this paper, we propose an efficient verification of erasure method (EVE) for verifying machine unlearning without requiring involvement in the model's initial training process. The core idea is to perturb the unlearning data to ensure the model prediction of the specified samples will change before and after unlearning with perturbed data. The unlearning users can leverage the observation of the changes as a verification signal. Specifically, the perturbations are designed with two key objectives: ensuring the unlearning effect and altering the unlearned model's prediction of target samples. We formalize the perturbation generation as an adversarial optimization problem, solving it by aligning the unlearning gradient with the gradient of boundary change for target samples. We conducted extensive experiments, and the results show that EVE can verify machine unlearning without involving the model's initial training process, unlike backdoor-based methods. Moreover, EVE significantly outperforms state-of-the-art unlearning verification methods, offering significant speedup in efficiency while enhancing verification accuracy.

We propose Asymmetric Hierarchical Anchoring (AHA), which enforces directional information allocation by designating a structured semantic anchor within a shared hierarchy. In our instantiation, we exploit the hierarchical discrete representations induced by audio Residual Vector Quantization (RVQ) to guide video feature distillation into a shared semantic space. To ensure representational purity, we replace fragile mutual information estimators with a GRL-based adversarial decoupler that explicitly suppresses semantic leakage in modality-specific branches, and introduce Local Sliding Alignment (LSA) to encourage fine-grained temporal alignment across modalities.

Reinforcement learning (RL) provides a promising solution to address this limitation, yet applying RL to retriever optimization introduces two fundamental challenges: 1) the deterministic retrieval is incompatible with RL formulations, and 2) state aliasing arises from query-only retrieval in multi-hop reasoning. To address these challenges, we replace deterministic retrieval with stochastic sampling and formulate RAG as a Markov decision process, making retriever optimizable by RL. Further, we incorporate retrieval history into the state at each retrieval step to mitigate state aliasing. Extensive experiments across diverse RAG pipelines, datasets, and retriever scales demonstrate consistent improvements of our approach in RAG performance."}

To gain insight into this question, we introduce the sequential group composition task. In this task, networks receive a sequence of elements from a finite group encoded in a real vector space and must predict their cumulative product. The task can be order-sensitive and requires a nonlinear architecture to be learned. Our analysis isolates the roles of the group structure, encoding statistics, and sequence length in shaping learning. We prove that two-layer networks learn this task one irreducible representation of the group at a time in an order determined by the Fourier statistics of the encoding. These networks can perfectly learn the task, but doing so requires a hidden width exponential in the sequence length $k$. In contrast, we show how deeper models exploit the associativity of the task to dramatically improve this scaling: recurrent neural networks compose elements sequentially in $k$ steps, while multilayer networks compose adjacent pairs in parallel in $\\log k$ layers. Overall, the sequential group composition task offers a tractable window into the mechanics of deep learning."}

Given their importance in applications, it is important to extend EP to nonconservative systems, $\\textit{i.e.}$ systems with non-reciprocal interactions. Previous attempts to generalize EP to such systems failed to compute the exact gradient of the cost function. Here we propose a framework that extends EP to arbitrary nonconservative systems, including feedforward networks. We keep the key property of equilibrium propagation, namely the use of stationary states both for inference and learning. However, we modify the dynamics in the learning phase by a term proportional to the non-reciprocal part of the interaction so as to obtain the exact gradient of the cost function. This algorithm can also be derived using a variational formulation that generates the learning dynamics through an energy function defined over an augmented state space. Numerical experiments using the MNIST database show that this algorithm achieves better performance and learns faster than previous proposals."}

Automated anomaly detection on logs is therefore critical, yet most established methods rely on log parsers that collapse messages into discrete templates, discarding variable values and semantic content. We propose ContraLog, a parser-free and self-supervised method that reframes log anomaly detection as predicting continuous message embeddings rather than discrete template IDs. ContraLog combines a message encoder that produces rich embeddings for individual log messages with a sequence encoder to model temporal dependencies within sequences. The model is trained with a combination of masked language modeling and contrastive learning to predict masked message embeddings based on the surrounding context. Experiments on the HDFS, BGL, and Thunderbird benchmark datasets empirically demonstrate effectiveness on complex datasets with diverse log messages. Additionally, we find that message embeddings generated by ContraLog carry meaningful information and are predictive of anomalies even without sequence context. These results highlight embedding-level prediction as an approach for log anomaly detection, with potential applicability to other event sequences."}

We present QuAIL, a quality-informed training mechanism that incorporates feature reliability priors directly into the learning process. QuAIL augments existing models with a learnable feature-modulation layer whose updates are selectively constrained by a quality-dependent proximal regularizer, thereby inducing controlled adaptation across features of varying trustworthiness. This stabilizes optimization under structured corruption without explicit data repair or sample-level reweighting. Empirical evaluation across 50 classification and regression datasets demonstrates that QuAIL consistently improves average performance over neural baselines under both random and value-dependent corruption, with especially robust behavior in low-data and systematically biased settings. These results suggest that incorporating feature reliability information directly into optimization dynamics is a practical and effective approach for resilient tabular learning."}

Inspired by the success of large language models (LLMs), we propose a pretrain-then-finetune approach built on a designed Transformer model to address this challenge. The model is first pretrained on large-scale, domain-informed synthetic data that encode managerial knowledge and structural features of the decision environment, and is then fine-tuned on real observations. This new pipeline offers two complementary advantages: pretraining injects domain knowledge into the learning process and enables the training of high-capacity models using abundant synthetic data, while finetuning adapts the pretrained model to the operational environment and improves alignment with the true data-generating regime. While we have leveraged the Transformer's state-of-the-art representational capacity, particularly its attention mechanism, to efficiently extract cross-task structure, our approach is not an off-the-shelf application. Instead, it relies on problem-specific architectural design and a tailored training procedure to match the decision setting. Theoretically, we develop the first comprehensive error analysis regarding Transformer learning in relevant contexts, establishing nonasymptotic guarantees that validate the method's effectiveness. Critically, our analysis reveals how pretraining and fine-tuning jointly determine performance, with the dominant contribution governed by whichever is more favorable. In particular, finetuning exhibits an economies-of-scale effect, whereby transfer learning becomes increasingly effective as the number of instances grows."}

To address these limitations, we propose the CoRSA (Conflict-Resolving and Sharpness-Aware Minimization) training framework, a parameter-efficient, holistic approach for knowledge editing with multiple updates. CoRSA tackles multiple challenges simultaneously: it improves generalization to different input forms and enhances stability across multiple updates by minimizing loss curvature, and resolves conflicts by maximizing the margin between new and prior knowledge. Across three widely used fact editing benchmarks, CoRSA achieves significant gains in generalization, outperforming baselines with average absolute improvements of 12.42% over LoRA and 10% over model editing methods. With multiple updates, it maintains high update efficacy while reducing catastrophic forgetting by 27.82% compared to LoRA. CoRSA also generalizes to the code domain, outperforming the strongest baseline by 5.48% Pass@5 in update efficacy."}

To scale, we implement filters with Chebyshev polynomial expansions, avoiding eigendecompositions. We further propose Transferable Adaptive Spectral Shaping (TASS): the baseline kernel is learned on source graphs and, on a target graph, kept fixed while only the shaping parameters are adapted, enabling few-shot transfer under matched compute. Across controlled synthetic benchmarks spanning graph families and signal regimes, Adaptive Spectral Shaping reduces reconstruction error relative to fixed-prototype wavelets and learned linear banks, and TASS yields consistent positive transfer. The framework provides compact spectral modules that plug into graph signal processing pipelines and graph neural networks, combining scalability, interpretability, and cross-graph generalization."}

In this work, we provide a theoretical analysis demonstrating the existence of anytime learning schedules for overparameterized linear regression, and we highlight the central role of weight averaging - also known as model merging - in achieving the minimax convergence rates of stochastic gradient descent. We show that these anytime schedules polynomially decay with time, with the decay rate determined by the source and capacity conditions of the problem. Empirically, we evaluate 150M and 300M parameter language models trained at 1-32x Chinchilla scale, comparing constant learning rates with weight averaging and $1/\\sqrt{t}$ schedules with weight averaging against a well-tuned cosine schedule. Across the full training range, the anytime schedules achieve comparable final loss to cosine decay. Taken together, our results suggest that weight averaging combined with simple, horizon-free step sizes offers a practical and effective anytime alternative to cosine learning rate schedules for large language model pretraining."}

We apply LDR in the off-policy setting in combination with standard data-based training objectives, without requiring additional on-policy samples. LDR acts as a shape regularizer of the energy landscape by leveraging additional information in the form of target energy labels. The proposed regularization framework is broadly applicable, supporting unbiased or biased simulation datasets as well as purely variational training without access to target samples. Across all benchmarks, LDR improves both final performance and data efficiency, with sample efficiency gains of up to one order of magnitude."}

As an example, we apply it to the 150-year-old problem of Indian monsoon forecasting, focusing on benefits to rain-fed agriculture, which is highly susceptible to climate change. AIWP models skillfully predict an agriculturally relevant onset index at regional scales weeks in advance when evaluated out-of-sample using deterministic and probabilistic metrics.

Ablating this joint prediction yields faster inference but degrades performance, revealing that accurate prediction at the decoded position relies on joint reasoning about the distribution of undecoded tokens. We interpret these as latent tokens and introduce a method for modulating their number, demonstrating empirically that this enables a smooth tradeoff between inference speed and sample quality. Furthermore, we demonstrate that latent tokens can be introduced into autoregressive models through an auxiliary multi-token prediction objective, yielding substantial improvements on the same reasoning tasks where they have traditionally struggled. Our results suggest that latent tokens, while arising naturally in diffusion, represent a general mechanism for improving performance on tasks requiring global coherence or lookahead."}

To address this, we introduce RC, an iterative decoding algorithm that replaces standard autoregressive decoding during both training and inference. RC exploits an asymmetry between the response generation and summarization capabilities of LLMs to construct reasoning chains that consistently improve across iterations. Models trained to use RC can extrapolate and continually improve over reasoning horizons more than an order of magnitude longer than those seen during training.

A classical resolution relies on state augmentation with a continuous variable. However, unless restricted to a specialized class of admissible value functions, this formulation induces sparse rewards and degenerate fixed points.

To appear in ICLR 2026", "summary": "Modern AI agents such as large language models are trained on diverse tasks -- translation, code generation, mathematical reasoning, and text prediction -- simultaneously. A key question is to quantify how each individual training task influences performance on a target task, a problem we refer to as task attribution. The direct approach, leave-one-out retraining, measures the effect of removing each task, but is computationally infeasible at scale. An alternative approach that builds surrogate models to predict a target task's performance for any subset of training tasks has emerged in recent literature. Prior work focuses on linear surrogate models, which capture first-order relationships, but miss nonlinear interactions such as synergy, antagonism, or XOR-type effects. In this paper, we first consider a unified task weighting framework for analyzing task attribution methods, and show a new connection between linear surrogate models and influence functions through a second-order analysis. Then, we introduce kernel surrogate models, which more effectively represent second-order task interactions. To efficiently learn the kernel surrogate, we develop a gradient-based estimation procedure that leverages a first-order approximation of pretrained models; empirically, this yields accurate estimates with less than $2\\%$ relative error without repeated retraining. Experiments across multiple domains -- including math reasoning in transformers, in-context learning, and multi-objective reinforcement learning -- demonstrate the effectiveness of kernel surrogate models. They achieve a $25\\%$ higher correlation with the leave-one-out ground truth than linear surrogates and influence-function baselines. When used for downstream task selection, kernel surrogate models yield a $40\\%$ improvement in demonstration selection for in-context learning and multi-objective reinforcement learning benchmarks."}

Furthermore, updating parameters using these unlearning procedures often degrades the general-purpose capabilities the model acquired during pre-training. Motivated by these shortcomings, this paper considers the paradigm of inference time unlearning -- wherein, the generative model is equipped with an (approximately correct) verifier that judges whether the model's response satisfies appropriate unlearning guarantees. This paper introduces a framework that iteratively refines the quality of the generated responses using feedback from the verifier without updating the model parameters.

As a by-product of our method, we re-discover recently introduced mechanism of Gaussian kernel approximation applied in particular to improve linear-attention Transformers, considering simple random walks on graphs and by-passing original complex mathematical computations. We complement our algorithm with a rigorous theoretical analysis and verify in thorough experimental studies."}

Previous work developed and deployed tube-based pure and hybrid ML models in the CTF subchannel code, however, full-scale reactor core simulations require the use of rod bundle geometries. Unlike isolated subchannels, rod bundles experience complex thermal hydraulic phenomena such as channel crossflow, spacer grid losses, and effects from unheated conductors. This study investigates the generalization of ML-based CHF prediction models in rod bundles after being trained on tube-based CHF data. A purely data-driven DNN and two hybrid bias-correction models were implemented in the CTF subchannel code and used to predict CHF location and magnitude in the Combustion Engineering 5-by-5 bundle CHF test series. The W-3 correlation, Bowring correlation, and Groeneveld LUT were used as baseline comparators. On average, all three ML-based approaches produced magnitude and location predictions more accurate than the baseline models, with the hybrid LUT model exhibiting the most favorable performance metrics."}

While online RL tends to perform better than offline RL, its higher training cost and instability hinders wide adoption. In this paper, we build on the observation that multi-turn code generation can be formulated as a one-step recoverable Markov decision process and propose contextual bandit learning with offline trajectories (Cobalt), a new method that combines the benefits of online and offline RL. Cobalt first collects code generation trajectories using a reference LLM and divides them into partial trajectories as contextual prompts. Then, during online bandit learning, the LLM is trained to complete each partial trajectory prompt through single-step code generation. Cobalt outperforms two multi-turn online RL baselines based on GRPO and VeRPO, and substantially improves R1-Distill 8B and Qwen3 8B by up to 9.0 and 6.2 absolute Pass@1 scores on LiveCodeBench. Also, we analyze LLMs' in-context reward hacking behaviors and augment Cobalt training with perturbed trajectories to mitigate this issue. Overall, our results demonstrate Cobalt as a promising solution for iterative decision-making tasks like multi-turn code generation.

To solve this problem, we propose a Curriculum-Guided Feature Learning and Three-Stage Attention Network (CL3AN-GNN), a learning network that uses a three-step attention system (Engage, Enact, Embed) similar to how humans learn. The model begins by engaging with structurally simpler features, defined as (1) local neighbourhood patterns (1-hop), (2) low-degree node attributes, and (3) class-separable node pairs identified via initial graph convolutional networks and graph attention networks (GCN and GAT) embeddings. This foundation enables stable early learning despite label skew. The Enact stage then addresses complicated aspects: (1) connections that require multiple steps, (2) edges that connect different types of nodes, and (3) nodes at the edges of minority classes by using adjustable attention weights. Finally, Embed consolidates these features via iterative message passing and curriculum-aligned loss weighting. We evaluate CL3AN-GNN on eight Open Graph Benchmark datasets spanning social, biological, and citation networks. Experiments show consistent improvements across all datasets in accuracy, F1-score, and AUC over recent state-of-the-art methods. The model's step-by-step method works well with different types of graph datasets, showing quicker results than training everything at once, better performance on new, imbalanced graphs, and clear explanations of each step using gradient stability and attention correlation learning curves. This work provides both a theoretically grounded framework for curriculum learning in GNNs and practical evidence of its effectiveness against imbalances, validated through metrics, convergence speeds, and generalisation tests."}

However, existing fingerprinting techniques that could be used to detect such distillation rely on heuristic perturbations that impose a steep trade-off between generation quality and fingerprinting strength, often requiring significant degradation of utility to ensure the fingerprint is effectively internalized by the student. We introduce antidistillation fingerprinting (ADFP), a principled approach that aligns the fingerprinting objective with the student's learning dynamics. Building upon the gradient-based framework of antidistillation sampling, ADFP utilizes a proxy model to identify and sample tokens that directly maximize the expected detectability of the fingerprint in the student after fine-tuning, rather than relying on the incidental absorption of the un-targeted biases of a more naive watermark. Experiments on GSM8K and OASST1 benchmarks demonstrate that ADFP achieves a significant Pareto improvement over state-of-the-art baselines, yielding stronger detection confidence with minimal impact on utility, even when the student model's architecture is unknown."}

SymPlex formulates symbolic PDE solving as tree-structured decision-making and optimizes candidate solutions using only the PDE and its boundary conditions. At its core is SymFormer, a structure-aware Transformer that models hierarchical symbolic dependencies via tree-relative self-attention and enforces syntactic validity through grammar-constrained autoregressive decoding, overcoming the limited expressivity of sequence-based generators. Unlike numerical and neural approaches that approximate solutions in discretized or implicit function spaces, SymPlex operates directly in symbolic expression space, enabling interpretable and human-readable solutions that naturally represent non-smooth behavior and explicit parametric dependence. Empirical results demonstrate exact recovery of non-smooth and parametric PDE solutions using deep learning-based symbolic methods."}

These interventions provide an important signal about where the current policy needs improvement, but are often noisy and incomplete. We define Robust Intervention Learning (RIL) as the problem of learning from intervention data while remaining robust to the quality and informativeness of the intervention signal. In the best case, interventions are precise and avoiding them is sufficient to solve the task, but in many realistic settings avoiding interventions is necessary but not sufficient for achieving good performance. We study robust intervention learning in the context of emergency stop interventions and propose Residual Intervention Fine-Tuning (RIFT), a residual fine-tuning algorithm that treats intervention feedback as an incomplete learning signal and explicitly combines it with a prior policy. By framing intervention learning as a fine-tuning problem, our approach leverages structure encoded in the prior policy to resolve ambiguity when intervention signals under-specify the task. We provide theoretical analysis characterizing conditions under which this formulation yields principled policy improvement, and identify regimes where intervention learning is expected to fail. Our experiments reveal that residual fine-tuning enables robust and consistent policy improvement across a range of intervention strategies and prior policy qualities, and highlight robust intervention learning as a promising direction for future work."}

However, in bandwidth-constrained distributed RL, scalability is often bottlenecked by the synchronization of policy weights from trainers to inference workers, particularly over commodity networks or in decentralized settings. While recent studies suggest that RL updates modify only a small fraction of model parameters, these observations are typically based on coarse checkpoint differences. We present a systematic empirical study of weight-update sparsity at both step-level and multi-step granularities, examining its evolution across training dynamics, off-policy delay, and model scale. We find that update sparsity is consistently high, frequently exceeding 99% across practically relevant settings. Leveraging this structure, we propose PULSE (Patch Updates via Lossless Sparse Encoding), a simple yet highly efficient lossless weight synchronization method that transmits only the indices and values of modified parameters. PULSE is robust to transmission errors and avoids floating-point drift inherent in additive delta schemes. In bandwidth-constrained decentralized environments, our approach achieves over 100x (14 GB to ~108 MB) communication reduction while maintaining bit-identical training dynamics and performance compared to full weight synchronization. By exploiting this structure, PULSE enables decentralized RL training to approach centralized throughput, reducing the bandwidth required for weight synchronization from 20 Gbit/s to 0.2 Gbit/s to maintain high GPU utilization."}

Our key observation is that pretrained networks exhibit substantial \\emph{geometric redundancy}, and that this redundancy can be exploited in two complementary ways. First, redundant neurons provide a proxy for dominant pretraining-era feature directions, enabling the construction of approximately protected update subspaces directly from pretrained weights. Second, redundancy offers a natural bias for \\emph{where} to place plasticity: by restricting updates to a subset of redundant neurons and constraining the remaining degrees of freedom, we obtain update families with reduced functional drift on the old-data distribution and improved worst-case retention guarantees.

Offloading MoE expert parameters to host memory and leveraging both CPU and GPU computation has recently emerged as a promising direction to support such models on resourceconstrained local PC platforms. While promising, we notice that existing approaches mismatch the dynamic nature of expert workloads, which leads to three fundamental inefficiencies: (1) Static expert assignment causes severe CPUGPU load imbalance, underutilizing CPU and GPU resources; (2) Existing prefetching techniques fail to accurately predict high-workload experts, leading to costly inaccurate prefetches; (3) GPU cache policies neglect workload dynamics, resulting in poor hit rates and limited effectiveness. To address these challenges, we propose DALI, a workloaDAware offLoadIng framework for efficient MoE inference on local PCs. To fully utilize hardware resources, DALI first dynamically assigns experts to CPU or GPU by modeling assignment as a 0-1 integer optimization problem and solving it efficiently using a Greedy Assignment strategy at runtime. To improve prefetching accuracy, we develop a Residual-Based Prefetching method leveraging inter-layer residual information to accurately predict high-workload experts. Additionally, we introduce a Workload-Aware Cache Replacement policy that exploits temporal correlation in expert activations to improve GPU cache efficiency. By evaluating across various MoE models and settings, DALI achieves significant speedups in the both prefill and decoding phases over the state-of-the-art offloading frameworks."}
