Conclusion: MLCommons科学基准本体论为科学机器学习中的可重现、跨领域基准测试提供了标准化、可扩展的基础。

Abstract: Scientific machine learning research spans diverse domains and data modalities, yet existing benchmark efforts remain siloed and lack standardization. This makes novel and transformative applications of machine learning to critical scientific use-cases more fragmented and less clear in pathways to impact. This paper introduces an ontology for scientific benchmarking developed through a unified, community-driven effort that extends the MLCommons ecosystem to cover physics, chemistry, materials science, biology, climate science, and more. Building on prior initiatives such as XAI-BENCH, FastML Science Benchmarks, PDEBench, and the SciMLBench framework, our effort consolidates a large set of disparate benchmarks and frameworks into a single taxonomy of scientific, application, and system-level benchmarks. New benchmarks can be added through an open submission workflow coordinated by the MLCommons Science Working Group and evaluated against a six-category rating rubric that promotes and identifies high-quality benchmarks, enabling stakeholders to select benchmarks that meet their specific needs. The architecture is extensible, supporting future scientific and AI/ML motifs, and we discuss methods for identifying emerging computing patterns for unique scientific workloads. The MLCommons Science Benchmarks Ontology provides a standardized, scalable foundation for reproducible, cross-domain benchmarking in scientific machine learning. A companion webpage for this work has also been developed as the effort evolves: https://mlcommons-science.github.io/benchmark/

### [2] [AGRAG: Advanced Graph-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation for LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05549)
*Yubo Wang,Haoyang Li,Fei Teng,Lei Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: AGRAG是一个先进的基于图的检索增强生成框架，通过统计方法构建图避免LLM幻觉，使用最小成本最大影响力子图生成算法创建显式推理路径，提升LLM的推理能力和回答质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于图的RAG方法面临三个关键挑战：不准确的图构建（由LLM幻觉引起）、推理能力差（无法生成显式推理路径）、回答不充分（LLM推理不足导致部分回答），导致在某些任务上表现不如NaiveRAG。

Method: AGRAG使用统计方法替代LLM实体提取来构建图；将图推理过程建模为最小成本最大影响力子图生成问题，提出贪心算法求解；生成的MCMI子图作为显式推理路径指导LLM。

Result: AGRAG避免了LLM幻觉和错误传播，生成的推理路径更全面（支持复杂图结构如环），使LLM能更好关注查询相关内容，减少噪声影响，提升推理能力。

Conclusion: AGRAG通过统计图构建和MCMI子图生成，有效解决了现有图基RAG方法的三个关键挑战，显著提升了检索增强生成的性能。

Abstract: Graph-based retrieval-augmented generation (Graph-based RAG) has demonstrated significant potential in enhancing Large Language Models (LLMs) with structured knowledge. However, existing methods face three critical challenges: Inaccurate Graph Construction, caused by LLM hallucination; Poor Reasoning Ability, caused by failing to generate explicit reasons telling LLM why certain chunks were selected; and Inadequate Answering, which only partially answers the query due to the inadequate LLM reasoning, making their performance lag behind NaiveRAG on certain tasks. To address these issues, we propose AGRAG, an advanced graph-based retrieval-augmented generation framework. When constructing the graph, AGRAG substitutes the widely used LLM entity extraction method with a statistics-based method, avoiding hallucination and error propagation. When retrieval, AGRAG formulates the graph reasoning procedure as the Minimum Cost Maximum Influence (MCMI) subgraph generation problem, where we try to include more nodes with high influence score, but with less involving edge cost, to make the generated reasoning paths more comprehensive. We prove this problem to be NP-hard, and propose a greedy algorithm to solve it. The MCMI subgraph generated can serve as explicit reasoning paths to tell LLM why certain chunks were retrieved, thereby making the LLM better focus on the query-related part contents of the chunks, reducing the impact of noise, and improving AGRAG's reasoning ability. Furthermore, compared with the simple tree-structured reasoning paths, our MCMI subgraph can allow more complex graph structures, such as cycles, and improve the comprehensiveness of the generated reasoning paths.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大模型分布式推理中的异常排查需要大量专家手动操作，诊断过程耗时且准确率低。

Method: 利用GPU工作器的同步性和一致性，通过函数追踪数据在纳秒级检测内核级异常；将检测结果集成到领域适配的LLM中，提供系统性因果推理。

Conclusion: KAT框架能够有效解决大模型分布式推理中的异常排查问题，提高诊断效率和成功率。

Abstract: Anomaly troubleshooting for large model distributed inference (LMDI) remains a critical challenge. Resolving anomalies such as inference performance degradation or latency jitter in distributed system demands significant manual efforts from domain experts, resulting in extremely time-consuming diagnosis processes with relatively low accuracy. In this paper, we introduce Kunlun Anomaly Troubleshooter (KAT), the first anomaly troubleshooting framework tailored for LMDI. KAT addresses this problem through two core innovations. First, KAT exploits the synchronicity and consistency of GPU workers, innovatively leverages function trace data to precisely detect kernel-level anomalies and associated hardware components at nanosecond resolution. Second, KAT integrates these detection results into a domain-adapted LLM, delivering systematic causal reasoning and natural language interpretation of complex anomaly symptoms. Evaluations conducted in Alibaba Cloud Service production environment indicate that KAT achieves over 0.884 precision and 0.936 recall in anomaly detection, providing detail anomaly insights that significantly narrow down the diagnostic scope and improve both the efficiency and success rate of troubleshooting.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本研究开发了能源安全指数的每日代理指标，使用XGBoost算法进行15天预测，解决了年度指数响应性不足的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 政策环境快速变化，但能源安全指数仅年度报告，无法响应短期波动，需要高频监测工具。

Method: 两阶段方法：首先用时序相似性度量选择每日代理指标，然后用XGBoost算法建模生成15天预测。

Result: 布伦特原油量被选为最佳代理指标，模型训练集R²为0.981，测试集为0.945，预测显示短期波动模式。

Conclusion: 该方法将低频宏观经济指标转化为高频可操作信号，为政策制定者提供实时监测工具，特别适用于数据稀缺环境。

Abstract: The policy environment of countries changes rapidly, influencing macro-level indicators such as the Energy Security Index. However, this index is only reported annually, limiting its responsiveness to short-term fluctuations. To address this gap, the present study introduces a daily proxy for the Energy Security Index and applies it to forecast energy security at a daily frequency.The study employs a two stage approach first, a suitable daily proxy for the annual Energy Security Index is identified by applying six time series similarity measures to key energy related variables. Second, the selected proxy is modeled using the XGBoost algorithm to generate 15 day ahead forecasts, enabling high frequency monitoring of energy security dynamics.As the result of proxy choosing, Volume Brent consistently emerged as the most suitable proxy across the majority of methods. The model demonstrated strong performance, with an R squared of 0.981 on the training set and 0.945 on the test set, and acceptable error metrics . The 15 day forecast of Brent volume indicates short term fluctuations, with a peak around day 4, a decline until day 8, a rise near day 10, and a downward trend toward day 15, accompanied by prediction intervals.By integrating time series similarity measures with machine learning based forecasting, this study provides a novel framework for converting low frequency macroeconomic indicators into high frequency, actionable signals. The approach enables real time monitoring of the Energy Security Index, offering policymakers and analysts a scalable and practical tool to respond more rapidly to fast changing policy and market conditions, especially in data scarce environments.

### [6] [Diversified Flow Matching with Translation Identifiability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05558)
*Sagar Shrestha,Xiao Fu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了多样化流匹配（DFM），这是一个基于ODE的框架，用于解决多样化分布匹配（DDM）问题，通过定制化的双层优化训练损失、非线性插值和结构重构来实现可识别性翻译。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DDM虽然解决了无配对域翻译中的内容不对齐问题，但只能使用GAN实现，存在训练不稳定且无法提供传输轨迹信息的局限性。而传输轨迹在单细胞进化分析和机器人路径规划等应用中很有价值。

Method: 提出DFM框架，通过定制化的双层优化训练损失、非线性插值和结构重构，将流匹配（FM）适应到DDM中，学习翻译函数的速度而非函数本身。

Result: 在合成和真实世界数据集上的实验验证了所提方法的有效性。

Conclusion: DFM是首个基于ODE且保证翻译可识别性的方法，克服了GAN在DDM中的局限性，同时提供了有用的传输轨迹信息。

Abstract: Diversified distribution matching (DDM) finds a unified translation function mapping a diverse collection of conditional source distributions to their target counterparts. DDM was proposed to resolve content misalignment issues in unpaired domain translation, achieving translation identifiability. However, DDM has only been implemented using GANs due to its constraints on the translation function. GANs are often unstable to train and do not provide the transport trajectory information -- yet such trajectories are useful in applications such as single-cell evolution analysis and robot route planning. This work introduces diversified flow matching (DFM), an ODE-based framework for DDM. Adapting flow matching (FM) to enforce a unified translation function as in DDM is challenging, as FM learns the translation function's velocity rather than the translation function itself. A custom bilevel optimization-based training loss, a nonlinear interpolant, and a structural reformulation are proposed to address these challenges, offering a tangible implementation. To our knowledge, DFM is the first ODE-based approach guaranteeing translation identifiability. Experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets validate the proposed method.

### [7] [Effective Test-Time Scaling of Discrete Diffusion through Iterative Refinement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05562)
*Sanghyun Lee,Sunwoo Kim,Seungryong Kim,Jongho Park,Dongmin Park*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了IterRef方法，一种针对离散扩散模型的测试时缩放技术，通过奖励引导的噪声-去噪转换逐步优化未对齐的中间状态。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 测试时缩放通过奖励引导生成在离散扩散模型中尚未充分探索，但具有作为有前景替代方案的潜力。

Method: 基于Multiple-Try Metropolis框架，利用奖励引导的噪声-去噪转换逐步精炼未对齐的中间状态，证明其收敛到奖励对齐分布。

Result: 在文本和图像领域的多种离散扩散模型上评估，观察到奖励引导生成质量的持续改进，特别是在低计算预算下取得显著增益。

Conclusion: IterRef方法在离散扩散模型中实现了有效的测试时缩放，显著超越了现有最先进基线方法。

Abstract: Test-time scaling through reward-guided generation remains largely unexplored for discrete diffusion models despite its potential as a promising alternative. In this work, we introduce Iterative Reward-Guided Refinement (IterRef), a novel test-time scaling method tailored to discrete diffusion that leverages reward- guided noising-denoising transitions to progressively refine misaligned intermediate states. We formalize this process within a Multiple-Try Metropolis (MTM) framework, proving convergence to the reward-aligned distribution. Unlike prior methods that assume the current state is already aligned with the reward distribution and only guide the subsequent transition, our approach explicitly refines each state in situ, progressively steering it toward the optimal intermediate distribution. Across both text and image domains, we evaluate IterRef on diverse discrete diffusion models and observe consistent improvements in reward-guided generation quality. In particular, IterRef achieves striking gains under low compute budgets, far surpassing prior state-of-the-art baselines.

### [8] [Lookahead Unmasking Elicits Accurate Decoding in Diffusion Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05563)
*Sanghyun Lee,Seungryong Kim,Jongho Park,Dongmin Park*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了Lookahead Unmasking (LookUM)方法，通过路径生成和验证机制优化掩码扩散模型的解码顺序，在多个基准测试中实现性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于置信度的采样方法存在短视问题，无法利用额外计算资源，且早期解码错误会级联传播，需要更智能的解码策略。

Method: 将采样重新定义为路径选择问题，包含路径生成器（从解掩码集合池中采样路径）和验证器（计算路径不确定性并进行重要性采样）。

Result: 在数学、规划和编程等6个基准测试中实现一致性能提升，仅需2-3条路径即可达到峰值性能，LLaDA模型结合LookUM可与RL调优的LLaDA 1.5相媲美。

Conclusion: 基于不确定性的验证为强化学习提供了正交优势，证明了该框架的通用性，错误解掩码会显著增加序列级不确定性，该方法能有效避免错误轨迹。

Abstract: Masked Diffusion Models (MDMs) as language models generate by iteratively unmasking tokens, yet their performance crucially depends on the inference time order of unmasking. Prevailing heuristics, such as confidence based sampling, are myopic: they optimize locally, fail to leverage extra test-time compute, and let early decoding mistakes cascade. We propose Lookahead Unmasking (LookUM), which addresses these concerns by reformulating sampling as path selection over all possible unmasking orders without the need for an external reward model. Our framework couples (i) a path generator that proposes paths by sampling from pools of unmasking sets with (ii) a verifier that computes the uncertainty of the proposed paths and performs importance sampling to subsequently select the final paths. Empirically, erroneous unmasking measurably inflates sequence level uncertainty, and our method exploits this to avoid error-prone trajectories. We validate our framework across six benchmarks, such as mathematics, planning, and coding, and demonstrate consistent performance improvements. LookUM requires only two to three paths to achieve peak performance, demonstrating remarkably efficient path selection. The consistent improvements on both LLaDA and post-trained LLaDA 1.5 are particularly striking: base LLaDA with LookUM rivals the performance of RL-tuned LLaDA 1.5, while LookUM further enhances LLaDA 1.5 itself showing that uncertainty based verification provides orthogonal benefits to reinforcement learning and underscoring the versatility of our framework. Code will be publicly released.

Motivation: 分布偏移和少数子群经常削弱基于经验风险最小化训练的深度神经网络的可靠性。传统分布鲁棒优化方法依赖单一全局鲁棒性预算，可能导致模型过于保守或鲁棒性分配不当。

Method: 提出方差驱动的自适应样本级DRO框架，自动识别高风险训练样本并基于其在线损失方差分配个性化鲁棒性预算。使用KL散度式双边约束，将内层最大化问题转化为线性规划，采用水填充算法高效求解。引入预热阶段和线性增长调度来稳定训练。

Conclusion: Var-DRO框架通过个性化鲁棒性预算分配，有效解决了传统DRO方法的局限性，在多个数据集上表现出优越性能，同时保持实现简便性和计算效率。

Abstract: Distribution shifts and minority subpopulations frequently undermine the reliability of deep neural networks trained using Empirical Risk Minimization (ERM). Distributionally Robust Optimization (DRO) addresses this by optimizing for the worst-case risk within a neighborhood of the training distribution. However, conventional methods depend on a single, global robustness budget, which can lead to overly conservative models or a misallocation of robustness. We propose a variance-driven, adaptive, sample-level DRO (Var-DRO) framework that automatically identifies high-risk training samples and assigns a personalized robustness budget to each based on its online loss variance. Our formulation employs two-sided, KL-divergence-style bounds to constrain the ratio between adversarial and empirical weights for every sample. This results in a linear inner maximization problem over a convex polytope, which admits an efficient water-filling solution. To stabilize training, we introduce a warmup phase and a linear ramp schedule for the global cap on per-sample budgets, complemented by label smoothing for numerical robustness. Evaluated on CIFAR-10-C (corruptions), our method achieves the highest overall mean accuracy compared to ERM and KL-DRO. On Waterbirds, Var-DRO improves overall performance while matching or surpassing KL-DRO. On the original CIFAR-10 dataset, Var-DRO remains competitive, exhibiting the modest trade-off anticipated when prioritizing robustness. The proposed framework is unsupervised (requiring no group labels), straightforward to implement, theoretically sound, and computationally efficient.

Abstract: Accurate forecasting of jet fuel demand is crucial for optimizing supply chain operations in the aviation market. Fuel distributors specifically require precise estimates to avoid inventory shortages or excesses. However, there is a lack of studies that analyze the jet fuel demand forecasting problem using machine learning models. Instead, many industry practitioners rely on deterministic or expertise-based models. In this research, we evaluate the performance of data-driven approaches using a substantial amount of data obtained from a major aviation fuel distributor in the Danish market. Our analysis compares the predictive capabilities of traditional time series models, Prophet, LSTM sequence-to-sequence neural networks, and hybrid models. A key challenge in developing these models is the required forecasting horizon, as fuel demand needs to be predicted for the next 30 days to optimize sourcing strategies. To ensure the reliability of the data-driven approaches and provide valuable insights to practitioners, we analyze three different datasets. The primary objective of this study is to present a comprehensive case study on jet fuel demand forecasting, demonstrating the advantages of employing data-driven models and highlighting the impact of incorporating additional variables in the predictive models.

Method: 构建多模态聚合物数据集，使用LoRA方法对视觉语言模型进行指令调优微调。

Result: 微调后的模型在聚合物属性预测任务中优于单模态和基线方法，证明了多模态学习的益处。

Conclusion: 该方法减少了为不同属性训练单独模型的需求，降低了部署和维护成本，展示了多模态学习在材料科学中的潜力。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have shown strong performance in tasks like visual question answering and multimodal text generation, but their effectiveness in scientific domains such as materials science remains limited. While some machine learning methods have addressed specific challenges in this field, there is still a lack of foundation models designed for broad tasks like polymer property prediction using multimodal data. In this work, we present a multimodal polymer dataset to fine-tune VLMs through instruction-tuning pairs and assess the impact of multimodality on prediction performance. Our fine-tuned models, using LoRA, outperform unimodal and baseline approaches, demonstrating the benefits of multimodal learning. Additionally, this approach reduces the need to train separate models for different properties, lowering deployment and maintenance costs.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了DAUM框架，通过多目标学习和不确定性建模的联合建模来解决实时竞价拦截中的两个关键挑战：准确估计流量质量和置信度，以及不确定性建模带来的效率瓶颈。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 实时竞价拦截需要过滤无效或不相关流量以提高下游数据的完整性和可靠性，但面临两个挑战：需要准确估计流量质量并提供足够高的预测置信度（通常通过不确定性建模解决），以及不确定性建模在实时应用中由于重复推理导致的效率瓶颈。

Method: 提出了DAUM联合建模框架，将多目标学习与不确定性建模相结合，同时生成流量质量预测和可靠的置信度估计。基于DAUM，进一步应用知识蒸馏来减少不确定性建模的计算开销，同时保持预测准确性和不确定性估计的优势。

Result: 在JD广告数据集上的实验表明，DAUM持续提高了预测性能，蒸馏后的模型实现了推理速度的十倍提升。

Conclusion: DAUM框架有效解决了实时竞价拦截中的准确性和效率问题，通过联合建模和知识蒸馏技术，在保持预测准确性的同时显著提升了推理效率。

Abstract: Real-Time Auction (RTA) Interception aims to filter out invalid or irrelevant traffic to enhance the integrity and reliability of downstream data. However, two key challenges remain: (i) the need for accurate estimation of traffic quality together with sufficiently high confidence in the model's predictions, typically addressed through uncertainty modeling, and (ii) the efficiency bottlenecks that such uncertainty modeling introduces in real-time applications due to repeated inference. To address these challenges, we propose DAUM, a joint modeling framework that integrates multi-objective learning with uncertainty modeling, yielding both traffic quality predictions and reliable confidence estimates. Building on DAUM, we further apply knowledge distillation to reduce the computational overhead of uncertainty modeling, while largely preserving predictive accuracy and retaining the benefits of uncertainty estimation. Experiments on the JD advertisement dataset demonstrate that DAUM consistently improves predictive performance, with the distilled model delivering a tenfold increase in inference speed.

Result: 实验结果表明所提方法的有效性，深度诱导NTK在深度趋于无穷时收敛到高斯过程。

Conclusion: 该研究显著扩展了神经核理论的现有格局，为深度学习和缩放定律提供了深入理解。

Abstract: While deep learning has achieved remarkable success across a wide range of applications, its theoretical understanding of representation learning remains limited. Deep neural kernels provide a principled framework to interpret over-parameterized neural networks by mapping hierarchical feature transformations into kernel spaces, thereby combining the expressive power of deep architectures with the analytical tractability of kernel methods. Recent advances, particularly neural tangent kernels (NTKs) derived by gradient inner products, have established connections between infinitely wide neural networks and nonparametric Bayesian inference. However, the existing NTK paradigm has been predominantly confined to the infinite-width regime, while overlooking the representational role of network depth. To address this gap, we propose a depth-induced NTK kernel based on a shortcut-related architecture, which converges to a Gaussian process as the network depth approaches infinity. We theoretically analyze the training invariance and spectrum properties of the proposed kernel, which stabilizes the kernel dynamics and mitigates degeneration. Experimental results further underscore the effectiveness of our proposed method. Our findings significantly extend the existing landscape of the neural kernel theory and provide an in-depth understanding of deep learning and the scaling law.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了RED方法，通过分析初始方程的残差来改进方程发现系统，无需大量搜索即可获得更好的方程建议。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有神经引导方程发现系统在方程不符合用户期望时，缺乏高效获取其他方程建议的方法，需要大量人工干预。

Method: 将初始方程解析为语法树，使用节点计算规则计算每个子方程的残差，将残差作为新目标变量生成新提示，用更好的子方程替换原有子方程。

Result: 在Feynman基准测试的53个方程上，RED方法显著提升了所有测试的神经引导系统和经典遗传编程系统的性能。

Conclusion: RED是一种通用、快速且易于扩展的后处理方法，能够有效改进各种方程发现系统，提高方程质量。

Abstract: Neural-guided equation discovery systems use a data set as prompt and predict an equation that describes the data set without extensive search. However, if the equation does not meet the user's expectations, there are few options for getting other equation suggestions without intensive work with the system. To fill this gap, we propose Residuals for Equation Discovery (RED), a post-processing method that improves a given equation in a targeted manner, based on its residuals. By parsing the initial equation to a syntax tree, we can use node-based calculation rules to compute the residual for each subequation of the initial equation. It is then possible to use this residual as new target variable in the original data set and generate a new prompt. If, with the new prompt, the equation discovery system suggests a subequation better than the old subequation on a validation set, we replace the latter by the former. RED is usable with any equation discovery system, is fast to calculate, and is easy to extend for new mathematical operations. In experiments on 53 equations from the Feynman benchmark, we show that it not only helps to improve all tested neural-guided systems, but also all tested classical genetic programming systems.

TL;DR: CoPRIS是一种异步强化学习系统，通过并发控制部分rollout和重要性采样校正，解决了传统同步RL系统因长轨迹导致的训练效率低下问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM的RL系统采用完全同步方式，长轨迹会阻塞整个rollout过程，导致GPU空闲，训练效率低下。

Method: 提出CoPRIS：1）维持固定数量的并发rollout；2）收集足够样本后提前终止；3）重用未完成轨迹；4）引入跨阶段重要性采样校正来减轻off-policy轨迹的影响。

Result: 在数学推理基准测试中，CoPRIS实现了1.94倍的训练加速，同时保持与同步RL系统相当或更好的性能。

Conclusion: CoPRIS有效解决了RL后训练中的长尾效率问题，显著提升了训练速度而不牺牲性能。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) post-training has become a trending paradigm for enhancing the capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Most existing RL systems for LLMs operate in a fully synchronous manner, where training must wait for the rollout of an entire batch to complete. This design leads to severe inefficiencies, as extremely long trajectories can stall the entire rollout process and leave many GPUs idle. To address this issue, we propose Concurrency- Controlled Partial Rollout with Importance Sampling (CoPRIS), which mitigates long-tail inefficiencies by maintaining a fixed number of concurrent rollouts, early-terminating once sufficient samples are collected, and reusing unfinished trajectories in subsequent rollouts. To mitigate the impact of off-policy trajectories, we introduce Cross-stage Importance Sampling Correction, which concatenates buffered log probabilities from the previous policy with those recomputed under the current policy for importance sampling correction. Experiments on challenging mathematical reasoning benchmarks show that CoPRIS achieves up to 1.94x faster training while maintaining comparable or superior performance to synchronous RL systems. The code of CoPRIS is available at https://github.com/777pomingzi/CoPRIS.

TL;DR: FedSparQ是一个轻量级联邦学习压缩框架，通过动态稀疏化、半精度量化和残差集成来减少通信开销，在保持模型精度的同时减少90%的通信量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦学习在保护数据隐私的同时面临显著的通信开销问题，需要频繁交换高维模型更新，这在受限网络中尤为突出。

Method: 采用自适应阈值动态稀疏化客户端梯度，对保留的条目应用半精度量化，并集成误差反馈的残差以防止信息丢失。无需手动调整稀疏率或量化计划，适应同质和异质数据分布，且与模型架构无关。

Result: 在IID和非IID数据下的视觉基准测试中，FedSparQ显著减少了通信开销（相比FedAvg减少90%的字节传输），同时保持或提高了模型精度（相比FedAvg未压缩方案或最先进的压缩模型提高6%），并增强了收敛鲁棒性（相比其他基线提高50%）。

Conclusion: FedSparQ为带宽受限的联邦学习部署提供了实用、易于部署的解决方案，并为自适应精度和隐私保护协议的未来扩展奠定了基础。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across decentralized clients while preserving data privacy by keeping raw data local. However, FL suffers from significant communication overhead due to the frequent exchange of high-dimensional model updates over constrained networks. In this paper, we present FedSparQ, a lightweight compression framework that dynamically sparsifies the gradient of each client through an adaptive threshold, applies half-precision quantization to retained entries and integrates residuals from error feedback to prevent loss of information. FedSparQ requires no manual tuning of sparsity rates or quantization schedules, adapts seamlessly to both homogeneous and heterogeneous data distributions, and is agnostic to model architecture. Through extensive empirical evaluation on vision benchmarks under independent and identically distributed (IID) and non-IID data, we show that FedSparQ substantially reduces communication overhead (reducing by 90% of bytes sent compared to FedAvg) while preserving or improving model accuracy (improving by 6% compared to FedAvg non-compressed solution or to state-of-the-art compression models) and enhancing convergence robustness (by 50%, compared to the other baselines). Our approach provides a practical, easy-to-deploy solution for bandwidth-constrained federated deployments and lays the groundwork for future extensions in adaptive precision and privacy-preserving protocols.

Conclusion: GRAVER通过生成式图词汇表实现了跨领域和任务的稳健知识迁移，解决了图基础模型微调的不稳定性问题

Abstract: Inspired by the remarkable success of foundation models in language and vision, Graph Foundation Models (GFMs) hold significant promise for broad applicability across diverse graph tasks and domains. However, existing GFMs struggle with unstable few-shot fine-tuning, where both performance and adaptation efficiency exhibit significant fluctuations caused by the randomness in the support sample selection and structural discrepancies between the pre-trained and target graphs. How to fine-tune GFMs robustly and efficiently to enable trustworthy knowledge transfer across domains and tasks is the major challenge. In this paper, we propose GRAVER, a novel Generative gRAph VocabulariEs for Robust GFM fine-tuning framework that tackles the aforementioned instability via generative augmentations. Specifically, to identify transferable units, we analyze and extract key class-specific subgraph patterns by ego-graph disentanglement and validate their transferability both theoretically and empirically. To enable effective pre-training across diverse domains, we leverage a universal task template based on ego-graph similarity and construct graph vocabularies via graphon-based generative experts. To facilitate robust and efficient prompt fine-tuning, we grave the support samples with in-context vocabularies, where the lightweight MoE-CoE network attentively routes knowledge from source domains. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of GRAVER over effectiveness, robustness, and efficiency on downstream few-shot node and graph classification tasks compared with 15 state-of-the-art baselines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 受隐私法规和"被遗忘权"驱动，需要在边缘设备上实现机器遗忘，但现有的服务器中心化或重训练方法在计算和能源预算紧张的情况下不实用。

Method: 结合上下文自适应遗忘（从后端层开始编辑，达到目标遗忘后停止）和平衡阻尼（按深度缩放阻尼强度以保持保留精度），在RISC-V边缘AI处理器中实现轻量级IP用于Fisher估计和阻尼。

Result: 在CIFAR-20和PinsFaceRecognition数据集上，FiCABU实现了随机猜测的遗忘精度，同时匹配SSD基线的保留精度，计算量减少高达87.52%（ResNet-18）和71.03%（ViT）。硬件原型进一步将能耗降至SSD基线的6.48%（CIFAR-20）和0.13%（PinsFaceRecognition）。

Conclusion: FiCABU证明后端优先、深度感知的遗忘学习可以在资源受限的边缘AI设备上实现实用性和高效性。

Abstract: Machine unlearning, driven by privacy regulations and the "right to be forgotten", is increasingly needed at the edge, yet server-centric or retraining-heavy methods are impractical under tight computation and energy budgets. We present FiCABU (Fisher-based Context-Adaptive Balanced Unlearning), a software-hardware co-design that brings unlearning to edge AI processors. FiCABU combines (i) Context-Adaptive Unlearning, which begins edits from back-end layers and halts once the target forgetting is reached, with (ii) Balanced Dampening, which scales dampening strength by depth to preserve retain accuracy. These methods are realized in a full RTL design of a RISC-V edge AI processor that integrates two lightweight IPs for Fisher estimation and dampening into a GEMM-centric streaming pipeline, validated on an FPGA prototype and synthesized in 45 nm for power analysis. Across CIFAR-20 and PinsFaceRecognition with ResNet-18 and ViT, FiCABU achieves random-guess forget accuracy while matching the retraining-free Selective Synaptic Dampening (SSD) baseline on retain accuracy, reducing computation by up to 87.52 percent (ResNet-18) and 71.03 percent (ViT). On the INT8 hardware prototype, FiCABU further improves retain preservation and reduces energy to 6.48 percent (CIFAR-20) and 0.13 percent (PinsFaceRecognition) of the SSD baseline. In sum, FiCABU demonstrates that back-end-first, depth-aware unlearning can be made both practical and efficient for resource-constrained edge AI devices.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables decentralized model training across multiple clients while optionally preserving data privacy. However, communication efficiency remains a critical bottleneck, particularly for large-scale models. In this work, we introduce two complementary algorithms: ProjFL, designed for unbiased compressors, and ProjFL+EF, tailored for biased compressors through an Error Feedback mechanism. Both methods rely on projecting local gradients onto a shared client-server subspace spanned by historical descent directions, enabling efficient information exchange with minimal communication overhead. We establish convergence guarantees for both algorithms under strongly convex, convex, and non-convex settings. Empirical evaluations on standard FL classification benchmarks with deep neural networks show that ProjFL and ProjFL+EF achieve accuracy comparable to existing baselines while substantially reducing communication costs.

Motivation: 联邦学习的通信成本限制了其部署，特别是在系统异构环境下。现有的误差有损压缩方法（如SZ）针对平滑科学数据设计，对低平滑度和弱空间相关性的梯度张量压缩效果不佳。

Method: 提出创新的预测机制：基于归一化指数移动平均的跨轮次幅度预测器，以及利用梯度振荡和核级符号一致性的符号预测器。该预测器与标准量化器和熵编码器兼容。

Conclusion: 该框架显著提升了联邦学习的通信效率，展示了在实际部署中的强可扩展性。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables collaborative model training without exposing clients' private data, but its deployment is often constrained by the communication cost of transmitting gradients between clients and the central server, especially under system heterogeneity where low-bandwidth clients bottleneck overall performance. Lossy compression of gradient data can mitigate this overhead, and error-bounded lossy compression (EBLC) is particularly appealing for its fine-grained utility-compression tradeoff. However, existing EBLC methods (e.g., SZ), originally designed for smooth scientific data with strong spatial locality, rely on generic predictors such as Lorenzo and interpolation for entropy reduction to improve compression ratio. Gradient tensors, in contrast, exhibit low smoothness and weak spatial correlation, rendering these predictors ineffective and leading to poor compression ratios. To address this limitation, we propose an EBLC framework tailored for FL gradient data to achieve high compression ratios while preserving model accuracy. The core of it is an innovative prediction mechanism that exploits temporal correlations across FL training rounds and structural regularities within convolutional kernels to reduce residual entropy. The predictor is compatible with standard quantizers and entropy coders and comprises (1) a cross-round magnitude predictor based on a normalized exponential moving average, and (2) a sign predictor that leverages gradient oscillation and kernel-level sign consistency. Experiments show that this new EBLC yields up to 1.53x higher compression ratios than SZ3 with lower accuracy loss. Integrated into a real-world FL framework, APPFL, it reduces end-to-end communication time by 76.1%-96.2% under various constrained-bandwidth scenarios, demonstrating strong scalability for real-world FL deployments.

Abstract: As machine learning (ML) is increasingly implemented in hardware to address real-time challenges in scientific applications, the development of advanced toolchains has significantly reduced the time required to iterate on various designs. These advancements have solved major obstacles, but also exposed new challenges. For example, processes that were not previously considered bottlenecks, such as hardware synthesis, are becoming limiting factors in the rapid iteration of designs. To mitigate these emerging constraints, multiple efforts have been undertaken to develop an ML-based surrogate model that estimates resource usage of ML accelerator architectures. We introduce wa-hls4ml, a benchmark for ML accelerator resource and latency estimation, and its corresponding initial dataset of over 680,000 fully connected and convolutional neural networks, all synthesized using hls4ml and targeting Xilinx FPGAs. The benchmark evaluates the performance of resource and latency predictors against several common ML model architectures, primarily originating from scientific domains, as exemplar models, and the average performance across a subset of the dataset. Additionally, we introduce GNN- and transformer-based surrogate models that predict latency and resources for ML accelerators. We present the architecture and performance of the models and find that the models generally predict latency and resources for the 75% percentile within several percent of the synthesized resources on the synthetic test dataset.

Abstract: In the era of smart manufacturing, predictive maintenance (PdM) plays a pivotal role in improving equipment reliability and reducing operating costs. In this paper, we propose a novel Markov Decision Process (MDP) framework that integrates advanced soft computing techniques - Fourier Neural Operator (FNO), Denoising Autoencoder (DAE), Graph Neural Network (GNN), and Proximal Policy Optimisation (PPO) - to address the multidimensional challenges of predictive maintenance in complex manufacturing systems. Specifically, the proposed framework innovatively combines the powerful frequency-domain representation capability of FNOs to capture high-dimensional temporal patterns; DAEs to achieve robust, noise-resistant latent state embedding from complex non-Gaussian sensor data; and GNNs to accurately represent inter-device dependencies for coordinated system-wide maintenance decisions. Furthermore, by exploiting PPO, the framework ensures stable and efficient optimisation of long-term maintenance strategies to effectively handle uncertainty and non-stationary dynamics. Experimental validation demonstrates that the approach significantly outperforms multiple deep learning baseline models with up to 13% cost reduction, as well as strong convergence and inter-module synergy. The framework has considerable industrial potential to effectively reduce downtime and operating expenses through data-driven strategies.

Abstract: Recent research has demonstrated that artificial intelligence (AI) can assist electronic design automation (EDA) in improving both the quality and efficiency of chip design. But current AI for EDA (AI-EDA) infrastructures remain fragmented, lacking comprehensive solutions for the entire data pipeline from design execution to AI integration. Key challenges include fragmented flow engines that generate raw data, heterogeneous file formats for data exchange, non-standardized data extraction methods, and poorly organized data storage. This work introduces a unified open-source library for EDA (AiEDA) that addresses these issues. AiEDA integrates multiple design-to-vector data representation techniques that transform diverse chip design data into universal multi-level vector representations, establishing an AI-aided design (AAD) paradigm optimized for AI-EDA workflows. AiEDA provides complete physical design flows with programmatic data extraction and standardized Python interfaces bridging EDA datasets and AI frameworks. Leveraging the AiEDA library, we generate iDATA, a 600GB dataset of structured data derived from 50 real chip designs (28nm), and validate its effectiveness through seven representative AAD tasks spanning prediction, generation, optimization and analysis. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/OSCC-Project/AiEDA, while the full iDATA dataset is being prepared for public release, providing a foundation for future AI-EDA research.

Conclusion: 建立了通过时空流交互建模复杂系统的原则性方法，FlowNet在性能和物理可解释性方面表现出色。

Abstract: Accurately modeling complex dynamic spatio-temporal systems requires capturing flow-mediated interdependencies and context-sensitive interaction dynamics. Existing methods, predominantly graph-based or attention-driven, rely on similarity-driven connectivity assumptions, neglecting asymmetric flow exchanges that govern system evolution. We propose Spatio-Temporal Flow, a physics-inspired paradigm that explicitly models dynamic node couplings through quantifiable flow transfers governed by conservation principles. Building on this, we design FlowNet, a novel architecture leveraging flow tokens as information carriers to simulate source-to-destination transfers via Flow Allocation Modules, ensuring state redistribution aligns with conservation laws. FlowNet dynamically adjusts the interaction radius through an Adaptive Spatial Masking module, suppressing irrelevant noise while enabling context-aware propagation. A cascaded architecture enhances scalability and nonlinear representation capacity. Experiments demonstrate that FlowNet significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches on seven metrics in the modeling of three real-world systems, validating its efficiency and physical interpretability. We establish a principled methodology for modeling complex systems through spatio-temporal flow interactions.

Conclusion: MoSKA为可扩展的LLM推理提供了一条清晰的架构路径，有效解决了KV缓存的内存瓶颈问题。

Abstract: The escalating context length in Large Language Models (LLMs) creates a severe performance bottleneck around the Key-Value (KV) cache, whose memory-bound nature leads to significant GPU under-utilization. This paper introduces Mixture of Shared KV Attention (MoSKA), an architecture that addresses this challenge by exploiting the heterogeneity of context data. It differentiates between per-request unique and massively reused shared sequences. The core of MoSKA is a novel Shared KV Attention mechanism that transforms the attention on shared data from a series of memory-bound GEMV operations into a single, compute-bound GEMM by batching concurrent requests. This is supported by an MoE-inspired sparse attention strategy that prunes the search space and a tailored Disaggregated Infrastructure that specializes hardware for unique and shared data. This comprehensive approach demonstrates a throughput increase of up to 538.7x over baselines in workloads with high context sharing, offering a clear architectural path toward scalable LLM inference.

Abstract: Flexible electronics offer unique advantages for conformable, lightweight, and disposable healthcare wearables. However, their limited gate count, large feature sizes, and high static power consumption make on-body machine learning classification highly challenging. While existing bendable RISC-V systems provide compact solutions, they lack the energy efficiency required. We present a mechanically flexible RISC-V that integrates a bespoke multiply-accumulate co-processor with fixed coefficients to maximize energy efficiency and minimize latency. Our approach formulates a constrained programming problem to jointly determine co-processor constants and optimally map Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) inference operations, enabling compact, model-specific hardware by leveraging the low fabrication and non-recurring engineering costs of flexible technologies. Post-layout results demonstrate near-real-time performance across several healthcare datasets, with our circuits operating within the power budget of existing flexible batteries and occupying only 2.42 mm^2, offering a promising path toward accessible, sustainable, and conformable healthcare wearables. Our microprocessors achieve an average 2.35x speedup and 2.15x lower energy consumption compared to the state of the art.

Abstract: This study presents a new high-fidelity multi-modal dataset containing 16000+ geometric variants of automotive hoods useful for machine learning (ML) applications such as engineering component design and process optimization, and multiphysics system surrogates. The dataset is centered on a practical multiphysics problem-hood deformation from fluid entrapment and inertial loading during rotary-dip painting. Each hood is numerically modeled with a coupled Large-Eddy Simulation (LES)-Finite Element Analysis (FEA), using 1.2M cells in total to ensure spatial and temporal accuracy. The dataset provides time-resolved physical fields, along with STL meshes and structured natural language prompts for text-to-geometry synthesis. Existing datasets are either confined to 2D cases, exhibit limited geometric variations, or lack the multi-modal annotations and data structures - shortcomings we address with AutoHood3D. We validate our numerical methodology, establish quantitative baselines across five neural architectures, and demonstrate systematic surrogate errors in displacement and force predictions. These findings motivate the design of novel approaches and multiphysics loss functions that enforce fluid-solid coupling during model training. By providing fully reproducible workflows, AutoHood3D enables physics-aware ML development, accelerates generative-design iteration, and facilitates the creation of new FSI benchmarks.

Method: 通过工业规模移动游戏玩家参与度预测任务进行实证分析，并设计受控合成实验对比已见和未见频率带的信号。

Result: 时间序列基础模型在工业任务中表现不如领域适应基线，在频谱不匹配情况下出现系统性性能下降。

Conclusion: 频率感知对于稳健的时间序列基础模型部署至关重要，需要开发考虑频谱多样性的新预训练和评估协议。

Abstract: Time series foundation models (TSFMs) have shown strong results on public benchmarks, prompting comparisons to a "BERT moment" for time series. Their effectiveness in industrial settings, however, remains uncertain. We examine why TSFMs often struggle to generalize and highlight spectral shift (a mismatch between the dominant frequency components in downstream tasks and those represented during pretraining) as a key factor. We present evidence from an industrial-scale player engagement prediction task in mobile gaming, where TSFMs underperform domain-adapted baselines. To isolate the mechanism, we design controlled synthetic experiments contrasting signals with seen versus unseen frequency bands, observing systematic degradation under spectral mismatch. These findings position frequency awareness as critical for robust TSFM deployment and motivate new pretraining and evaluation protocols that explicitly account for spectral diversity.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有关于非平稳老虎机下界的研究主要依赖稀疏采样论证，但这种方法存在局限性。本文旨在开发一种基于信念惯性的根本不同方法，更准确地捕捉算法在环境变化时的行为模式。

Method: 引入信念惯性论证，分析算法通过历史奖励平均值编码的经验信念如何产生抵抗新证据的动量。利用这种惯性构造对抗性实例来误导经典算法。

Conclusion: 信念惯性是推导非平稳老虎机尖锐下界的有力方法，揭示了现有算法在应对环境变化时的固有局限性。

Abstract: We study the problem of worst case regret in piecewise stationary multi armed bandits. While the minimax theory for stationary bandits is well established, understanding analogous limits in time-varying settings is challenging. Existing lower bounds rely on what we refer to as infrequent sampling arguments, where long intervals without exploration allow adversarial reward changes that induce large regret.
  In this paper, we introduce a fundamentally different approach based on a belief inertia argument. Our analysis captures how an algorithm's empirical beliefs, encoded through historical reward averages, create momentum that resists new evidence after a change. We show how this inertia can be exploited to construct adversarial instances that mislead classical algorithms such as Explore Then Commit, epsilon greedy, and UCB, causing them to suffer regret that grows linearly with T and with a substantial constant factor, regardless of how their parameters are tuned, even with a single change point.
  We extend the analysis to algorithms that periodically restart to handle non stationarity and prove that, even then, the worst case regret remains linear in T. Our results indicate that utilizing belief inertia can be a powerful method for deriving sharp lower bounds in non stationary bandits.

### [31] [Unveiling the Training Dynamics of ReLU Networks through a Linear Lens](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05628)
*Longqing Ye*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出一个分析框架，将多层ReLU网络重新表述为具有输入依赖"有效权重"的等效单层线性模型，通过追踪样本特定有效权重的演化来理解表示学习机制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度神经网络（特别是使用ReLU的）通常被视为复杂的高维非线性系统，这种复杂性给理解其内部学习机制带来了重大挑战。

Method: 通过ReLU单元的激活模式创建独特的计算路径，有效归零网络中的部分权重。通过组合所有层中的活动权重，可以为每个特定样本推导出将输入直接映射到输出的有效权重矩阵。

Result: 训练过程中，来自同一类样本的有效权重会收敛，而来自不同类的有效权重会发散。通过追踪这些样本特定有效权重的轨迹，可以解释类特定决策边界的形成和网络中语义表示的出现。

Conclusion: 有效权重的演化揭示了表示学习的基本原理，为理解深度神经网络内部机制提供了新的视角。

Abstract: Deep neural networks, particularly those employing Rectified Linear Units (ReLU), are often perceived as complex, high-dimensional, non-linear systems. This complexity poses a significant challenge to understanding their internal learning mechanisms. In this work, we propose a novel analytical framework that recasts a multi-layer ReLU network into an equivalent single-layer linear model with input-dependent "effective weights". For any given input sample, the activation pattern of ReLU units creates a unique computational path, effectively zeroing out a subset of weights in the network. By composing the active weights across all layers, we can derive an effective weight matrix, $W_{\text{eff}}(x)$, that maps the input directly to the output for that specific sample. We posit that the evolution of these effective weights reveals fundamental principles of representation learning. Our work demonstrates that as training progresses, the effective weights corresponding to samples from the same class converge, while those from different classes diverge. By tracking the trajectories of these sample-wise effective weights, we provide a new lens through which to interpret the formation of class-specific decision boundaries and the emergence of semantic representations within the network.

TL;DR: 提出了SSTODE框架，一种基于物理信息的神经常微分方程方法，用于海表温度预测，通过结合流体输运原理和能量交换积分器，提高预测精度和物理可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 数据驱动模型在海表温度预测中缺乏可解释性且忽略关键物理过程，现有物理信息神经网络难以处理复杂的海气动力学，特别是海水运动和外部驱动因素的表征不足。

Method: 从流体输运原理推导常微分方程，结合平流和扩散建模海洋时空动力学；通过变分优化恢复控制SST时间动态的潜速度场；引入基于海洋热收支方程的能量交换积分器来考虑外部强迫因素。

Result: 在全局和区域SST预测基准测试中达到最先进性能；可视化展示了平流动力学、热扩散模式和昼夜加热-冷却循环对SST演变的影响。

Conclusion: SSTODE框架不仅提高了预测精度，还增强了模型的可解释性和物理一致性，为理解SST动态提供了更深入的见解。

Abstract: Sea Surface Temperature (SST) is crucial for understanding upper-ocean thermal dynamics and ocean-atmosphere interactions, which have profound economic and social impacts. While data-driven models show promise in SST prediction, their black-box nature often limits interpretability and overlooks key physical processes. Recently, physics-informed neural networks have been gaining momentum but struggle with complex ocean-atmosphere dynamics due to 1) inadequate characterization of seawater movement (e.g., coastal upwelling) and 2) insufficient integration of external SST drivers (e.g., turbulent heat fluxes). To address these challenges, we propose SSTODE, a physics-informed Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (Neural ODEs) framework for SST prediction. First, we derive ODEs from fluid transport principles, incorporating both advection and diffusion to model ocean spatiotemporal dynamics. Through variational optimization, we recover a latent velocity field that explicitly governs the temporal dynamics of SST. Building upon ODE, we introduce an Energy Exchanges Integrator (EEI)-inspired by ocean heat budget equations-to account for external forcing factors. Thus, the variations in the components of these factors provide deeper insights into SST dynamics. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SSTODE achieves state-of-the-art performances in global and regional SST forecasting benchmarks. Furthermore, SSTODE visually reveals the impact of advection dynamics, thermal diffusion patterns, and diurnal heating-cooling cycles on SST evolution. These findings demonstrate the model's interpretability and physical consistency.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于卷积神经网络的混合ML-EPM框架，用于改进本征空间扰动方法(EPM)在湍流模拟中的不确定性量化，通过调制扰动幅度来获得更紧密且校准更好的不确定性估计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 湍流演化预测在科学和工程中至关重要，但现有湍流模型的简化会引入认知不确定性。EPM是广泛使用的物理基础方法，但纯物理基础的方法可能高估不确定性边界。

Method: 提出混合ML-EPM框架，使用卷积神经网络(CNN)来调制EPM的扰动幅度，在保持物理一致性的同时改进校准。

Result: 在典型测试案例中，混合ML-EPM框架相比基线EPM单独使用，产生了显著更紧密且校准更好的不确定性估计。

Conclusion: CNN调制的EPM方法能够有效改进湍流模型不确定性量化，在保持物理一致性的同时提供更准确的不确定性边界。

Abstract: Predicting the evolution of turbulent flows is central across science and engineering. Most studies rely on simulations with turbulence models, whose empirical simplifications introduce epistemic uncertainty. The Eigenspace Perturbation Method (EPM) is a widely used physics-based approach to quantify model-form uncertainty, but being purely physics-based it can overpredict uncertainty bounds. We propose a convolutional neural network (CNN)-based modulation of EPM perturbation magnitudes to improve calibration while preserving physical consistency. Across canonical cases, the hybrid ML-EPM framework yields substantially tighter, better-calibrated uncertainty estimates than baseline EPM alone.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统逆博弈理论方法假设代理的理性参数τ已知，当τ未知时会产生尺度模糊性，导致奖励参数θ和τ统计上不可识别。

Method: 引入归一化约束解决尺度模糊性，提出归一化最小二乘估计器，并扩展到马尔可夫博弈场景。

Result: 证明了NLS估计器达到最优收敛率O(N^{-1/2})，在强可识别性条件不满足时提供部分识别保证，在未知转移动态下仍表现良好。

Conclusion: Blind-IGT是第一个能够联合恢复θ和τ的统计框架，解决了逆博弈理论中的基本可识别性问题。

Abstract: Inverse Game Theory (IGT) methods based on the entropy-regularized Quantal Response Equilibrium (QRE) offer a tractable approach for competitive settings, but critically assume the agents' rationality parameter (temperature $τ$) is known a priori. When $τ$ is unknown, a fundamental scale ambiguity emerges that couples $τ$ with the reward parameters ($θ$), making them statistically unidentifiable. We introduce Blind-IGT, the first statistical framework to jointly recover both $θ$ and $τ$ from observed behavior. We analyze this bilinear inverse problem and establish necessary and sufficient conditions for unique identification by introducing a normalization constraint that resolves the scale ambiguity. We propose an efficient Normalized Least Squares (NLS) estimator and prove it achieves the optimal $\mathcal{O}(N^{-1/2})$ convergence rate for joint parameter recovery. When strong identifiability conditions fail, we provide partial identification guarantees through confidence set construction. We extend our framework to Markov games and demonstrate optimal convergence rates with strong empirical performance even when transition dynamics are unknown.

TL;DR: 提出了KL-Adaptive Stability Sampling (KLASS)方法，通过利用token级别的KL散度识别稳定预测，在保持样本质量的同时显著加速扩散模型的推理过程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于扩散模型的迭代细化过程，推理速度往往受到缓慢和静态采样速度的限制，需要开发更快的采样方法。

Method: KLASS方法利用token级别的KL散度来识别稳定、高置信度的预测，在每次迭代中同时解掩多个token，无需额外模型训练。

Result: 在推理基准测试中，KLASS实现了高达2.78倍的时钟加速，同时性能优于标准贪婪解码，在基于扩散的采样器中达到最先进结果。

Conclusion: KLASS在文本、图像和分子生成等多个领域都表现出有效性，证明其作为跨不同模型的通用采样器的广泛适用性。

Abstract: Masked diffusion models have demonstrated competitive results on various tasks including language generation. However, due to its iterative refinement process, the inference is often bottlenecked by slow and static sampling speed. To overcome this problem, we introduce `KL-Adaptive Stability Sampling' (KLASS), a fast yet effective sampling method that exploits token-level KL divergence to identify stable, high-confidence predictions. By unmasking multiple tokens in each iteration without any additional model training, our approach speeds up generation significantly while maintaining sample quality. On reasoning benchmarks, KLASS achieves up to $2.78\times$ wall-clock speedups while improving performance over standard greedy decoding, attaining state-of-the-art results among diffusion-based samplers. We further validate KLASS across diverse domains, including text, image, and molecular generation, showing its effectiveness as a broadly applicable sampler across different models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 强化学习策略在受控环境中训练后，在部署到真实环境时经常因分布偏移而失效。固定鲁棒性预算ε会导致性能与鲁棒性之间的权衡问题。

Method: 将ε作为连续课程，根据智能体进展自适应调度鲁棒性预算，实现名义性能和鲁棒性能的平衡。

Result: 在多个环境中，DR-SPCRL不仅稳定了训练，还实现了更优的鲁棒性-性能权衡，在变化扰动下平均奖励提高11.8%，性能约为名义RL算法的1.9倍。

Conclusion: DR-SPCRL方法通过自适应调度鲁棒性预算，有效解决了DRRL中固定ε带来的性能-鲁棒性权衡问题，实现了更稳定和优越的性能。

Abstract: A central challenge in reinforcement learning is that policies trained in controlled environments often fail under distribution shifts at deployment into real-world environments. Distributionally Robust Reinforcement Learning (DRRL) addresses this by optimizing for worst-case performance within an uncertainty set defined by a robustness budget $ε$. However, fixing $ε$ results in a tradeoff between performance and robustness: small values yield high nominal performance but weak robustness, while large values can result in instability and overly conservative policies. We propose Distributionally Robust Self-Paced Curriculum Reinforcement Learning (DR-SPCRL), a method that overcomes this limitation by treating $ε$ as a continuous curriculum. DR-SPCRL adaptively schedules the robustness budget according to the agent's progress, enabling a balance between nominal and robust performance. Empirical results across multiple environments demonstrate that DR-SPCRL not only stabilizes training but also achieves a superior robustness-performance trade-off, yielding an average 11.8\% increase in episodic return under varying perturbations compared to fixed or heuristic scheduling strategies, and achieving approximately 1.9$\times$ the performance of the corresponding nominal RL algorithms.

Abstract: Clinical trials play an important role in cancer care and research, yet participation rates remain low. We developed MSK-MATCH (Memorial Sloan Kettering Multi-Agent Trial Coordination Hub), an AI system for automated eligibility screening from clinical text. MSK-MATCH integrates a large language model with a curated oncology trial knowledge base and retrieval-augmented architecture providing explanations for all AI predictions grounded in source text. In a retrospective dataset of 88,518 clinical documents from 731 patients across six breast cancer trials, MSK-MATCH automatically resolved 61.9% of cases and triaged 38.1% for human review. This AI-assisted workflow achieved 98.6% accuracy, 98.4% sensitivity, and 98.7% specificity for patient-level eligibility classification, matching or exceeding performance of the human-only and AI-only comparisons. For the triaged cases requiring manual review, prepopulating eligibility screens with AI-generated explanations reduced screening time from 20 minutes to 43 seconds at an average cost of $0.96 per patient-trial pair.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer模型在表格数据的少样本场景下表现优异，但复杂度高、参数量大。需要找到既能保持少样本性能又参数高效的方法

Method: 提出TabDistill框架，将预训练Transformer模型的知识蒸馏到更简单的神经网络中

Result: 蒸馏后的神经网络在同等训练数据下超越了传统基线方法（常规神经网络、XGBoost、逻辑回归），在某些情况下甚至超过了原始Transformer模型

Conclusion: TabDistill框架实现了两全其美：参数高效的同时在有限训练数据下表现良好

Abstract: Transformer-based models have shown promising performance on tabular data compared to their classical counterparts such as neural networks and Gradient Boosted Decision Trees (GBDTs) in scenarios with limited training data. They utilize their pre-trained knowledge to adapt to new domains, achieving commendable performance with only a few training examples, also called the few-shot regime. However, the performance gain in the few-shot regime comes at the expense of significantly increased complexity and number of parameters. To circumvent this trade-off, we introduce TabDistill, a new strategy to distill the pre-trained knowledge in complex transformer-based models into simpler neural networks for effectively classifying tabular data. Our framework yields the best of both worlds: being parameter-efficient while performing well with limited training data. The distilled neural networks surpass classical baselines such as regular neural networks, XGBoost and logistic regression under equal training data, and in some cases, even the original transformer-based models that they were distilled from.

Abstract: We consider the problem of distributionally robust multimodal machine learning. Existing approaches often rely on merging modalities on the feature level (early fusion) or heuristic uncertainty modeling, which downplays modality-aware effects and provide limited insights. We propose a novel distributionally robust optimization (DRO) framework that aims to study both the theoretical and practical insights of multimodal machine learning. We first justify this setup and show the significance of this problem through complexity analysis. We then establish both generalization upper bounds and minimax lower bounds which provide performance guarantees. These results are further extended in settings where we consider encoder-specific error propogations. Empirically, we demonstrate that our approach improves robustness in both simulation settings and real-world datasets. Together, these findings provide a principled foundation for employing multimodal machine learning models in high-stakes applications where uncertainty is unavoidable.

TL;DR: GastroDL-Fusion是一个双模态深度学习框架，整合蛋白质-配体复合物数据和疾病相关基因序列信息，用于胃肠道疾病的药物和疫苗开发，显著提高了结合亲和力预测的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统计算模型仅依赖结构信息，无法捕捉影响疾病机制和治疗反应的遗传决定因素，因此需要整合结构信息和遗传特征来改进蛋白质-配体结合亲和力预测。

Method: 使用图同构网络(GIN)建模蛋白质-配体复合物的分子图表示，通过预训练Transformer(ProtBERT/ESM)将基因序列编码为生物学有意义的嵌入，通过多层感知机融合这两种互补模态以学习跨模态交互。

Result: 在胃肠道疾病相关靶点的基准数据集上，GastroDL-Fusion显著优于传统方法，达到平均绝对误差(MAE)1.12和均方根误差(RMSE)1.75，优于CNN、BiLSTM、GIN和仅使用Transformer的基线模型。

Conclusion: 结合结构和遗传特征能够更准确地预测结合亲和力，为加速胃肠道疾病靶向治疗和疫苗设计提供了可靠的计算工具。

Abstract: Accurate prediction of protein-ligand binding affinity plays a pivotal role in accelerating the discovery of novel drugs and vaccines, particularly for gastrointestinal (GI) diseases such as gastric ulcers, Crohn's disease, and ulcerative colitis. Traditional computational models often rely on structural information alone and thus fail to capture the genetic determinants that influence disease mechanisms and therapeutic responses. To address this gap, we propose GastroDL-Fusion, a dual-modal deep learning framework that integrates protein-ligand complex data with disease-associated gene sequence information for drug and vaccine development. In our approach, protein-ligand complexes are represented as molecular graphs and modeled using a Graph Isomorphism Network (GIN), while gene sequences are encoded into biologically meaningful embeddings via a pre-trained Transformer (ProtBERT/ESM). These complementary modalities are fused through a multi-layer perceptron to enable robust cross-modal interaction learning. We evaluate the model on benchmark datasets of GI disease-related targets, demonstrating that GastroDL-Fusion significantly improves predictive performance over conventional methods. Specifically, the model achieves a mean absolute error (MAE) of 1.12 and a root mean square error (RMSE) of 1.75, outperforming CNN, BiLSTM, GIN, and Transformer-only baselines. These results confirm that incorporating both structural and genetic features yields more accurate predictions of binding affinities, providing a reliable computational tool for accelerating the design of targeted therapies and vaccines in the context of gastrointestinal diseases.

Abstract: We introduce the first formal large-scale assessment of the utility of traditional chemical functional groups as used in chemical explanations. Our assessment employs a fundamental principle from computational learning theory: a good explanation of data should also compress the data. We introduce an unsupervised learning algorithm based on the Minimum Message Length (MML) principle that searches for substructures that compress around three million biologically relevant molecules. We demonstrate that the discovered substructures contain most human-curated functional groups as well as novel larger patterns with more specific functions. We also run our algorithm on 24 specific bioactivity prediction datasets to discover dataset-specific functional groups. Fingerprints constructed from dataset-specific functional groups are shown to significantly outperform other fingerprint representations, including the MACCS and Morgan fingerprint, when training ridge regression models on bioactivity regression tasks.

Conclusion: QiVC框架展示了在真实世界生物医学信号分析中推进不确定性感知建模的潜力，其实现已在GitHub上开源。

Abstract: This work introduces the quantum-inspired variational convolution (QiVC) framework, a novel learning paradigm that integrates principles of probabilistic inference, variational optimization, and quantum-inspired transformations within convolutional architectures. The central innovation of QiVC lies in its quantum-inspired rotated ensemble (QiRE) mechanism. QiRE performs differentiable low-dimensional subspace rotations of convolutional weights, analogously to quantum state evolution. This approach enables structured uncertainty modeling while preserving the intrinsic geometry of the parameter space, resulting in more expressive, stable, and uncertainty-aware representations. To demonstrate its practical potential, the concept is instantiated in a QiVC-based convolutional network (QiVC-Net) and evaluated in the context of biosignal classification, focusing on phonocardiogram (PCG) recordings, a challenging domain characterized by high noise, inter-subject variability, and often imbalanced data. The proposed QiVC-Net integrates an architecture in which the QiVC layer does not introduce additional parameters, instead performing an ensemble rotation of the convolutional weights through a structured mechanism ensuring robustness without added highly computational burden. Experiments on two benchmark datasets, PhysioNet CinC 2016 and PhysioNet CirCor DigiScope 2022, show that QiVC-Net achieves state-of-the-art performance, reaching accuracies of 97.84% and 97.89%, respectively. These findings highlight the versatility of the QiVC framework and its promise for advancing uncertainty-aware modeling in real-world biomedical signal analysis. The implementation of the QiVConv layer is openly available in GitHub.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一个名为PartiBandits的主动学习算法，用于在有限标签数量下高效估计多类别随机变量的均值，该算法结合了UCB和基于分歧的方法，并在模拟中展示了良好性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在标签数量有限但拥有辅助信息（协变量）的情况下，如何高效估计随机变量的均值是一个重要问题。现有的主动学习方法如UCB和基于分歧的方法分别针对不同任务设计，需要一种能够结合两者优势的统一框架。

Method: PartiBandits是一个两阶段算法：第一阶段学习未标记数据的划分以减少Y的条件方差；第二阶段使用WarmStart-UCB子程序从每个分层中轮询请求标签。

Result: 算法得到的估计量满足平方误差为$\tilde{\mathcal{O}}\left( \frac{ν+ \exp(c \cdot (-N/\log(N))) }{N} \right)$，其中ν是贝叶斯最优分类器的风险。该收敛率在经典设置下达到极小极大最优。

Conclusion: PartiBandits成功桥接了UCB和基于分歧的主动学习方法，提供了一个统一的框架来处理均值估计问题，并通过电子健康记录模拟验证了方法的有效性。

Abstract: We study the problem of efficiently estimating the mean of a $k$-class random variable, $Y$, using a limited number of labels, $N$, in settings where the analyst has access to auxiliary information (i.e.: covariates) $X$ that may be informative about $Y$. We propose an active learning algorithm ("PartiBandits") to estimate $\mathbb{E}[Y]$. The algorithm yields an estimate, $\widehatμ_{\text{PB}}$, such that $\left( \widehatμ_{\text{PB}} - \mathbb{E}[Y]\right)^2$ is $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}\left( \frac{ν+ \exp(c \cdot (-N/\log(N))) }{N} \right)$, where $c > 0$ is a constant and $ν$ is the risk of the Bayes-optimal classifier. PartiBandits is essentially a two-stage algorithm. In the first stage, it learns a partition of the unlabeled data that shrinks the average conditional variance of $Y$. In the second stage it uses a UCB-style subroutine ("WarmStart-UCB") to request labels from each stratum round-by-round. Both the main algorithm's and the subroutine's convergence rates are minimax optimal in classical settings. PartiBandits bridges the UCB and disagreement-based approaches to active learning despite these two approaches being designed to tackle very different tasks. We illustrate our methods through simulation using nationwide electronic health records. Our methods can be implemented using the PartiBandits package in R.

*Zhen Xu,Zhen Tan,Song Wang,Kaidi Xu,Tianlong Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了两种创新方法来解决MoE-SAE中专家专业化不足的问题：多专家激活和特征缩放，显著降低了重构误差和特征冗余。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 稀疏自编码器在解释大语言模型时面临可解释性与效率的矛盾：高维隐藏层带来更好的可解释性但计算成本过高，而现有的MoE方法中专家往往学习重叠特征，未能真正专业化。

Method: 1. 多专家激活：同时激活语义加权的专家子集以鼓励专业化；2. 特征缩放：通过自适应高频缩放增强特征多样性。

Result: 实验显示重构误差降低24%，特征冗余减少99%，相比现有MoE-SAE方法有显著改进。

Conclusion: 这项工作弥合了LLM分析中的可解释性与效率差距，实现了透明的模型检查而不牺牲计算可行性。

Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) have emerged as a powerful tool for interpreting large language models (LLMs) by decomposing token activations into combinations of human-understandable features. While SAEs provide crucial insights into LLM explanations, their practical adoption faces a fundamental challenge: better interpretability demands that SAEs' hidden layers have high dimensionality to satisfy sparsity constraints, resulting in prohibitive training and inference costs. Recent Mixture of Experts (MoE) approaches attempt to address this by partitioning SAEs into narrower expert networks with gated activation, thereby reducing computation. In a well-designed MoE, each expert should focus on learning a distinct set of features. However, we identify a \textit{critical limitation} in MoE-SAE: Experts often fail to specialize, which means they frequently learn overlapping or identical features. To deal with it, we propose two key innovations: (1) Multiple Expert Activation that simultaneously engages semantically weighted expert subsets to encourage specialization, and (2) Feature Scaling that enhances diversity through adaptive high-frequency scaling. Experiments demonstrate a 24\% lower reconstruction error and a 99\% reduction in feature redundancy compared to existing MoE-SAE methods. This work bridges the interpretability-efficiency gap in LLM analysis, allowing transparent model inspection without compromising computational feasibility.

Motivation: 在鲁棒约束平均成本MDP中，由于缺乏强对偶性，无法直接使用标准的对偶方法进行约束强化学习，且平均成本设置下的鲁棒Bellman算子不是任何范数下的收缩算子。

Method: 提出了一个actor-critic算法，用于解决平均成本鲁棒约束MDP问题。

Conclusion: 成功解决了鲁棒约束平均成本MDP中的关键挑战，提出的算法在理论上具有可证明的收敛保证和合理的样本复杂度。

Abstract: In this work, we study the problem of finding robust and safe policies in Robust Constrained Average-Cost Markov Decision Processes (RCMDPs). A key challenge in this setting is the lack of strong duality, which prevents the direct use of standard primal-dual methods for constrained RL. Additional difficulties arise from the average-cost setting, where the Robust Bellman operator is not a contraction under any norm. To address these challenges, we propose an actor-critic algorithm for Average-Cost RCMDPs. We show that our method achieves both \(ε\)-feasibility and \(ε\)-optimality, and we establish a sample complexities of \(\tilde{O}\left(ε^{-4}\right)\) and \(\tilde{O}\left(ε^{-6}\right)\) with and without slackness assumption, which is comparable to the discounted setting.

Abstract: Ambient sensor-based human activity recognition (HAR) in smart homes remains challenging due to the need for real-time inference, spatially grounded reasoning, and context-aware temporal modeling. Existing approaches often rely on pre-segmented, within-activity data and overlook the physical layout of the environment, limiting their robustness in continuous, real-world deployments. In this paper, we propose MARAuder's Map, a novel framework for real-time activity recognition from raw, unsegmented sensor streams. Our method projects sensor activations onto the physical floorplan to generate trajectory-aware, image-like sequences that capture the spatial flow of human movement. These representations are processed by a hybrid deep learning model that jointly captures spatial structure and temporal dependencies. To enhance temporal awareness, we introduce a learnable time embedding module that encodes contextual cues such as hour-of-day and day-of-week. Additionally, an attention-based encoder selectively focuses on informative segments within each observation window, enabling accurate recognition even under cross-activity transitions and temporal ambiguity. Extensive experiments on multiple real-world smart home datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms strong baselines, offering a practical solution for real-time HAR in ambient sensor environments.

Abstract: Deep Reinforcement Learning have achieved significant success in automatically devising effective traffic signal control (TSC) policies. Neural policies, however, tend to be over-parameterized and non-transparent, hindering their interpretability and deployability on resource-limited edge devices. This work presents SymLight, a priority function search framework based on Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) for discovering inherently interpretable and deployable symbolic priority functions to serve as the TSC policies. The priority function, in particular, accepts traffic features as input and then outputs a priority for each traffic signal phase, which subsequently directs the phase transition. For effective search, we propose a concise yet expressive priority function representation. This helps mitigate the combinatorial explosion of the action space in MCTS. Additionally, a probabilistic structural rollout strategy is introduced to leverage structural patterns from previously discovered high-quality priority functions, guiding the rollout process. Our experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate SymLight's superior performance across a range of baselines. A key advantage is SymLight's ability to produce interpretable and deployable TSC policies while maintaining excellent performance.

Conclusion: 本文成功将遗憾最小化和最优臂识别结合到词典序偏好框架中，提出的算法特别是第二种算法通过跨目标信息共享实现了超越单目标性能的突破。

Abstract: In multi-objective decision-making with hierarchical preferences, lexicographic bandits provide a natural framework for optimizing multiple objectives in a prioritized order. In this setting, a learner repeatedly selects arms and observes reward vectors, aiming to maximize the reward for the highest-priority objective, then the next, and so on. While previous studies have primarily focused on regret minimization, this work bridges the gap between \textit{regret minimization} and \textit{best arm identification} under lexicographic preferences. We propose two elimination-based algorithms to address this joint objective. The first algorithm eliminates suboptimal arms sequentially, layer by layer, in accordance with the objective priorities, and achieves sample complexity and regret bounds comparable to those of the best single-objective algorithms. The second algorithm simultaneously leverages reward information from all objectives in each round, effectively exploiting cross-objective dependencies. Remarkably, it outperforms the known lower bound for the single-objective bandit problem, highlighting the benefit of cross-objective information sharing in the multi-objective setting. Empirical results further validate their superior performance over baselines.

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种高效的内联安全监控机制，在推理链提交前检测上下文不一致性，具有实际部署价值。

Abstract: Agentic language models compose multi step reasoning chains, yet intermediate steps can be corrupted by inconsistent context, retrieval errors, or adversarial inputs, which makes post hoc evaluation too late because errors propagate before detection. We introduce a diagnostic that requires no additional training and uses only the forward pass to emit a binary accept or reject signal during agent execution. The method analyzes token graphs induced by attention and computes two spectral statistics in early layers, namely the high frequency energy ratio and spectral entropy. We formalize these signals, establish invariances, and provide finite sample estimators with uncertainty quantification. Under a two regime mixture assumption with a monotone likelihood ratio property, we show that a single threshold on the high frequency energy ratio is optimal in the Bayes sense for detecting context inconsistency. Empirically, the high frequency energy ratio exhibits robust bimodality during context verification across multiple model families, which enables gating decisions with overhead below one millisecond on our hardware and configurations. We demonstrate integration into retrieval augmented agent pipelines and discuss deployment as an inline safety monitor. The approach detects contamination while the model is still processing the text, before errors commit to the reasoning chain.

*Winston Chen,Michael W. Sjoding,Jenna Wiens*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的模型评估方法NPW，利用RCT中所有数据来减少干预带来的评估偏差，提高模型选择效率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在AI社会影响应用中，干预措施会影响结果，导致模型评估存在偏差。RCT虽然能提供无偏评估，但只使用控制组数据效率低下

Method: 提出nuisance parameter weighting (NPW)方法，通过重新加权治疗组数据来模拟无干预情况下的结果分布

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上的实验表明，NPW方法在各种干预效应和样本量设置下都比标准方法产生更好的模型选择结果

Conclusion: 该研究为实现现实环境中更高效的模型评估迈出了重要一步

Abstract: AI models are often evaluated based on their ability to predict the outcome of interest. However, in many AI for social impact applications, the presence of an intervention that affects the outcome can bias the evaluation. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) randomly assign interventions, allowing data from the control group to be used for unbiased model evaluation. However, this approach is inefficient because it ignores data from the treatment group. Given the complexity and cost often associated with RCTs, making the most use of the data is essential. Thus, we investigate model evaluation strategies that leverage all data from an RCT. First, we theoretically quantify the estimation bias that arises from naïvely aggregating performance estimates from treatment and control groups, and derive the condition under which this bias leads to incorrect model selection. Leveraging these theoretical insights, we propose nuisance parameter weighting (NPW), an unbiased model evaluation approach that reweights data from the treatment group to mimic the distributions of samples that would or would not experience the outcome under no intervention. Using synthetic and real-world datasets, we demonstrate that our proposed evaluation approach consistently yields better model selection than the standard approach, which ignores data from the treatment group, across various intervention effect and sample size settings. Our contribution represents a meaningful step towards more efficient model evaluation in real-world contexts.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MOSS是一个新颖的FP8训练框架，通过两级微缩放策略和自动权重缩放，在保持训练性能的同时显著提升训练效率，相比BF16基线实现高达34%的训练吞吐量提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: FP8格式训练大型语言模型能带来显著效率提升，但现有方法存在去量化开销大和在线量化效率低的问题，需要解决FP8训练中的效率和数值稳定性挑战。

Method: 提出两级微缩放策略：结合高精度全局缩放和紧凑的2次幂局部缩放来量化敏感激活；以及线性层权重自动缩放：通过预测和调整缩放因子来消除昂贵的最大归约操作。

Result: MOSS成功训练了70亿参数模型，性能与BF16基线相当，同时实现了高达34%的训练吞吐量提升。

Conclusion: MOSS框架通过创新的缩放策略有效解决了FP8训练中的效率和稳定性问题，为高效的大模型训练提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Training large language models with FP8 formats offers significant efficiency gains. However, the reduced numerical precision of FP8 poses challenges for stable and accurate training. Current frameworks preserve training performance using mixed-granularity quantization, i.e., applying per-group quantization for activations and per-tensor/block quantization for weights. While effective, per-group quantization requires scaling along the inner dimension of matrix multiplication, introducing additional dequantization overhead. Moreover, these frameworks often rely on just-in-time scaling to dynamically adjust scaling factors based on the current data distribution. However, this online quantization is inefficient for FP8 training, as it involves multiple memory reads and writes that negate the performance benefits of FP8. To overcome these limitations, we propose MOSS, a novel FP8 training framework that ensures both efficiency and numerical stability. MOSS introduces two key innovations: (1) a two-level microscaling strategy for quantizing sensitive activations, which balances precision and dequantization cost by combining a high-precision global scale with compact, power-of-two local scales; and (2) automatic scaling for weights in linear layers, which eliminates the need for costly max-reduction operations by predicting and adjusting scaling factors during training. Leveraging these techniques, MOSS enables efficient FP8 training of a 7B parameter model, achieving performance comparable to the BF16 baseline while achieving up to 34% higher training throughput.

Conclusion: 本研究为MoE模型解释和开发最小性能损失的MoE架构剪枝技术提供了启发，推动了MoE模型在资源受限环境中的部署。

Abstract: In today's landscape, Mixture of Experts (MoE) is a crucial architecture that has been used by many of the most advanced models. One of the major challenges of MoE models is that they usually require much more memory than their dense counterparts due to their unique architecture, and hence are harder to deploy in environments with limited GPU memory, such as edge devices. MoE offloading is a promising technique proposed to overcome this challenge, especially if it is enhanced with caching and pre-fetching, but prior work stopped at suboptimal caching algorithm and offered limited insights. In this work, we study MoE offloading in depth and make the following contributions: 1. We analyze the expert activation and LRU caching behavior in detail and provide traces. 2. We propose LFU caching optimization based on our analysis and obtain strong improvements from LRU. 3. We implement and experiment speculative expert pre-fetching, providing detailed trace showing its huge potential . 4. In addition, our study extensively covers the behavior of the MoE architecture itself, offering information on the characteristic of the gating network and experts. This can inspire future work on the interpretation of MoE models and the development of pruning techniques for MoE architecture with minimal performance loss.

Motivation: 分类数据聚类中，由于分类数据无法直接计算距离，需要合适的距离度量。现有方法未考虑不同簇中属性值距离的差异，导致距离度量不合理。

Method: 提出簇定制化距离度量，基于每个簇中属性的不同分布来竞争性地更新距离，并将该方法扩展到包含数值和分类属性的混合数据。

Conclusion: 所提出的簇定制化距离度量方法能够有效解决分类数据聚类中的距离计算问题，并在混合数据上表现优异。

Abstract: An appropriate distance metric is crucial for categorical data clustering, as the distance between categorical data cannot be directly calculated. However, the distances between attribute values usually vary in different clusters induced by their different distributions, which has not been taken into account, thus leading to unreasonable distance measurement. Therefore, we propose a cluster-customized distance metric for categorical data clustering, which can competitively update distances based on different distributions of attributes in each cluster. In addition, we extend the proposed distance metric to the mixed data that contains both numerical and categorical attributes. Experiments demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method, i.e., achieving an average ranking of around first in fourteen datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习模型在推理时只能依赖滑动窗口的局部上下文，无法显式访问全局历史知识，导致丰富的全局模式未被充分利用。

Method: 构建全局记忆库存储历史模式，使用检索机制提取相似模式生成全局预测，然后与局部预测模型输出自适应结合。

Result: 在7个真实世界数据集上的实验表明，PFRP将先进单变量预测模型的平均性能提升了8.4%。

Conclusion: PFRP通过显式整合全局历史数据，有效提升了时间序列预测的准确性和可解释性。

Abstract: Deep learning models such as MLP, Transformer, and TCN have achieved remarkable success in univariate time series forecasting, typically relying on sliding window samples from historical data for training. However, while these models implicitly compress historical information into their parameters during training, they are unable to explicitly and dynamically access this global knowledge during inference, relying only on the local context within the lookback window. This results in an underutilization of rich patterns from the global history. To bridge this gap, we propose Predicting the Future by Retrieving the Past (PFRP), a novel approach that explicitly integrates global historical data to enhance forecasting accuracy. Specifically, we construct a Global Memory Bank (GMB) to effectively store and manage global historical patterns. A retrieval mechanism is then employed to extract similar patterns from the GMB, enabling the generation of global predictions. By adaptively combining these global predictions with the outputs of any local prediction model, PFRP produces more accurate and interpretable forecasts. Extensive experiments conducted on seven real-world datasets demonstrate that PFRP significantly enhances the average performance of advanced univariate forecasting models by 8.4\%.

Conclusion: EMOD框架通过统一的V-A空间表示和对比学习，成功解决了EEG情感识别中的跨数据集泛化问题，为异构EEG情感分析提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Emotion recognition from EEG signals is essential for affective computing and has been widely explored using deep learning. While recent deep learning approaches have achieved strong performance on single EEG emotion datasets, their generalization across datasets remains limited due to the heterogeneity in annotation schemes and data formats. Existing models typically require dataset-specific architectures tailored to input structure and lack semantic alignment across diverse emotion labels. To address these challenges, we propose EMOD: A Unified EEG Emotion Representation Framework Leveraging Valence-Arousal (V-A) Guided Contrastive Learning. EMOD learns transferable and emotion-aware representations from heterogeneous datasets by bridging both semantic and structural gaps. Specifically, we project discrete and continuous emotion labels into a unified V-A space and formulate a soft-weighted supervised contrastive loss that encourages emotionally similar samples to cluster in the latent space. To accommodate variable EEG formats, EMOD employs a flexible backbone comprising a Triple-Domain Encoder followed by a Spatial-Temporal Transformer, enabling robust extraction and integration of temporal, spectral, and spatial features. We pretrain EMOD on eight public EEG datasets and evaluate its performance on three benchmark datasets. Experimental results show that EMOD achieves state-of-the-art performance, demonstrating strong adaptability and generalization across diverse EEG-based emotion recognition scenarios.

Abstract: Tabular Prior-Data Fitted Network (TabPFN) is a foundation model designed for small to medium-sized tabular data, which has attracted much attention recently. This paper investigates the application of TabPFN in Combinatorial Optimization (CO) problems. The aim is to lessen challenges in time and data-intensive training requirements often observed in using traditional methods including exact and heuristic algorithms, Machine Learning (ML)-based models, to solve CO problems. Proposing possibly the first ever application of TabPFN for such a purpose, we adapt and fine-tune the TabPFN model to solve the Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP), one of the most well-known CO problems. Specifically, we adopt the node-based approach and the node-predicting adaptation strategy to construct the entire TSP route. Our evaluation with varying instance sizes confirms that TabPFN requires minimal training, adapts to TSP using a single sample, performs better generalization across varying TSP instance sizes, and reduces performance degradation. Furthermore, the training process with adaptation and fine-tuning is completed within minutes. The methodology leads to strong solution quality even without post-processing and achieves performance comparable to other models with post-processing refinement. Our findings suggest that the TabPFN model is a promising approach to solve structured and CO problems efficiently under training resource constraints and rapid deployment requirements.

Conclusion: FusionLog通过有效融合通用和专有知识，实现了无需目标系统标注数据的跨系统日志异常检测，解决了现有方法的知识不匹配问题。

Abstract: Log-based anomaly detection is critical for ensuring the stability and reliability of web systems. One of the key problems in this task is the lack of sufficient labeled logs, which limits the rapid deployment in new systems. Existing works usually leverage large-scale labeled logs from a mature web system and a small amount of labeled logs from a new system, using transfer learning to extract and generalize general knowledge across both domains. However, these methods focus solely on the transfer of general knowledge and neglect the disparity and potential mismatch between such knowledge and the proprietary knowledge of target system, thus constraining performance. To address this limitation, we propose FusionLog, a novel zero-label cross-system log-based anomaly detection method that effectively achieves the fusion of general and proprietary knowledge, enabling cross-system generalization without any labeled target logs. Specifically, we first design a training-free router based on semantic similarity that dynamically partitions unlabeled target logs into 'general logs' and 'proprietary logs.' For general logs, FusionLog employs a small model based on system-agnostic representation meta-learning for direct training and inference, inheriting the general anomaly patterns shared between the source and target systems. For proprietary logs, we iteratively generate pseudo-labels and fine-tune the small model using multi-round collaborative knowledge distillation and fusion based on large language model (LLM) and small model (SM) to enhance its capability to recognize anomaly patterns specific to the target system. Experimental results on three public log datasets from different systems show that FusionLog achieves over 90% F1-score under a fully zero-label setting, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art cross-system log-based anomaly detection methods.

Result: 在6种膜上验证，达到极高精度(R²=99.84%，RMSE=0.0348%)，推理时间亚毫秒级。在超出训练范围2.5倍压力下仍保持R²>86%，显著优于纯神经网络(R²=43.4%)。可在从桌面CPU到边缘设备部署。

Conclusion: 该工作通过结合物理严谨性和计算效率，为实时电解槽监控建立了新范式，加速安全高效绿氢基础设施部署，对实现净零排放目标至关重要。

Abstract: Green hydrogen production via polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) water electrolysis is pivotal for energy transition, yet hydrogen crossover through membranes threatens safety and economic viability-approaching explosive limits (4 mol% H$_2$ in O$_2$) while reducing Faradaic efficiency by 2.5%. Current physics-based models require extensive calibration and computational resources that preclude real-time implementation, while purely data-driven approaches fail to extrapolate beyond training conditions-critical for dynamic electrolyzer operation. Here we present the first application of physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) for hydrogen crossover prediction, integrating mass conservation, Fick's diffusion law, and Henry's solubility law within a compact architecture (17,793 parameters). Validated across six membranes under industrially relevant conditions (0.05-5.0 A/cm$^2$, 1-200 bar, 25-85°C), our PINN achieves exceptional accuracy (R$^2$ = 99.84%, RMSE = 0.0348%) with sub-millisecond inference times suitable for real-time control. Remarkably, the model maintains R$^2$ > 86% when predicting crossover at pressures 2.5x beyond training range-substantially outperforming pure neural networks (R$^2$ = 43.4%). The hardware-agnostic deployment, from desktop CPUs to edge devices (Raspberry Pi 4), enables distributed safety monitoring essential for gigawatt-scale installations. By bridging physical rigor and computational efficiency, this work establishes a new paradigm for real-time electrolyzer monitoring, accelerating deployment of safe, efficient green hydrogen infrastructure crucial for net-zero emissions targets.

*Vasily Ilin,Peter Sushko*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一个基于注意力机制的框架，用于联合进行概率密度和分数估计，通过序列到序列任务实现，开发了置换和仿射等变transformer，可直接从i.i.d.样本估计概率密度和分数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统分数匹配方法需要为每个分布训练单独的模型，而本方法旨在学习一个分布无关的单一算子，能够在不同密度和样本大小间泛化。

Method: 使用交叉注意力连接观测样本与任意查询点，构建置换和仿射等变的transformer架构，注意力权重可恢复经典核密度估计。

Result: 模型在误差和扩展性方面显著优于KDE和SD-KDE，同时具有更好的运行时扩展性。

Conclusion: transformer可作为非参数密度和分数估计的通用、数据自适应算子。

Abstract: We introduce a unified attention-based framework for joint score and density estimation. Framing the problem as a sequence-to-sequence task, we develop a permutation- and affine-equivariant transformer that estimates both the probability density $f(x)$ and its score $\nabla_x \log f(x)$ directly from i.i.d. samples. Unlike traditional score-matching methods that require training a separate model for each distribution, our approach learns a single distribution-agnostic operator that generalizes across densities and sample sizes. The architecture employs cross-attention to connect observed samples with arbitrary query points, enabling generalization beyond the training data, while built-in symmetry constraints ensure equivariance to permutation and affine transformations. Analytically, we show that the attention weights can recover classical kernel density estimation (KDE), and verify it empirically, establishing a principled link between classical KDE and the transformer architecture. Empirically, the model achieves substantially lower error and better scaling than KDE and score-debiased KDE (SD-KDE), while exhibiting better runtime scaling. Together, these results establish transformers as general-purpose, data-adaptive operators for nonparametric density and score estimation.

TL;DR: 使用纵向电子健康记录预测COPD患者的住院和死亡风险，深度学习模型在性能上优于机器学习和统计方法，特别是对于较难预测的住院事件。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: COPD患者住院风险增加且与生存率下降密切相关，但预测这些事件的时间在文献中关注有限，需要更准确的风险分层方法。

Method: 使用西班牙加泰罗尼亚SIDIAP数据库中15万多名患者2013-2017年的纵向EHR数据，将住院建模为首要事件，死亡作为半竞争性终点事件，比较了Cox比例风险、SurvivalBoost、DeepPseudo、SurvTRACE、Dynamic Deep-Hit和Deep Recurrent Survival Machine等多种模型。

Result: 采用循环架构的深度学习模型在一致性和时间依赖性AUC方面优于机器学习和线性方法，特别是对于较难预测的住院事件。

Conclusion: 这是首次在纵向EHR数据上应用深度生存分析来联合预测COPD患者的多个时间到事件结果，突显了深度学习方法捕捉时间模式和改进风险分层的潜力。

Abstract: Patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) have an increased risk of hospitalizations, strongly associated with decreased survival, yet predicting the timing of these events remains challenging and has received limited attention in the literature. In this study, we performed survival analysis to predict hospitalization and death in COPD patients using longitudinal electronic health records (EHRs), comparing statistical models, machine learning (ML), and deep learning (DL) approaches. We analyzed data from more than 150k patients from the SIDIAP database in Catalonia, Spain, from 2013 to 2017, modeling hospitalization as a first event and death as a semi-competing terminal event. Multiple models were evaluated, including Cox proportional hazards, SurvivalBoost, DeepPseudo, SurvTRACE, Dynamic Deep-Hit, and Deep Recurrent Survival Machine. Results showed that DL models utilizing recurrent architectures outperformed both ML and linear approaches in concordance and time-dependent AUC, especially for hospitalization, which proved to be the harder event to predict. This study is, to our knowledge, the first to apply deep survival analysis on longitudinal EHR data to jointly predict multiple time-to-event outcomes in COPD patients, highlighting the potential of DL approaches to capture temporal patterns and improve risk stratification.

TL;DR: NextLat通过在潜在空间中添加自监督预测目标，使Transformer学习能够预测下一个潜在状态的紧凑表示，从而注入循环归纳偏置，提升泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准Transformer缺乏压缩历史为紧凑潜在状态的内在动机，导致泛化能力差。需要一种方法让Transformer学习具有一致转换规则的紧凑世界模型。

Method: 在标准下一个词预测训练基础上，增加潜在空间中的自监督预测目标，训练Transformer学习能够预测下一个潜在状态的表示，同时保持架构和并行训练不变。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，NextLat在准确性、表示压缩和前向规划方面显著优于标准下一个词预测训练。

Conclusion: NextLat是一个简单有效的范式，能够将Transformer表示塑造成更强的泛化形式，形成紧凑的内部世界模型。

Abstract: Transformers replace recurrence with a memory that grows with sequence length and self-attention that enables ad-hoc look ups over past tokens. Consequently, they lack an inherent incentive to compress history into compact latent states with consistent transition rules. This often leads to learning solutions that generalize poorly. We introduce Next-Latent Prediction (NextLat), which extends standard next-token training with self-supervised predictions in the latent space. Specifically, NextLat trains a transformer to learn latent representations that are predictive of its next latent state given the next output token. Theoretically, we show that these latents provably converge to belief states, compressed information of the history necessary to predict the future. This simple auxiliary objective also injects a recurrent inductive bias into transformers, while leaving their architecture, parallel training, and inference unchanged. NextLat effectively encourages the transformer to form compact internal world models with its own belief states and transition dynamics -- a crucial property absent in standard next-token prediction transformers. Empirically, across benchmarks targeting core sequence modeling competencies -- world modeling, reasoning, planning, and language modeling -- NextLat demonstrates significant gains over standard next-token training in downstream accuracy, representation compression, and lookahead planning. NextLat stands as a simple and efficient paradigm for shaping transformer representations toward stronger generalization.

TL;DR: 开发了一种基于深度学习的模型，结合可解释人工智能方法，用于从心电图精确定位Wolff-Parkinson-White综合征的辅助通路位置，准确率超过95%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统诊断树方法和机器学习方法在辅助通路定位上存在解剖定位分辨率有限、可解释性差和小数据集的问题，需要更准确、透明的非侵入性定位方法。

Method: 使用个性化虚拟心脏模型生成的大规模合成心电图数据库训练深度学习模型，并集成Guided Backpropagation、Grad-CAM和Guided Grad-CAM等可解释AI方法。

Result: 模型在24个心脏区域的定位准确率超过95%，敏感性94.32%，特异性99.78%。V2导联被识别为最重要的定位导联，其次是aVF、V1和aVL。

Conclusion: 结合心脏数字孪生和可解释深度学习，能够实现准确、透明、非侵入性的辅助通路定位，具有临床转化潜力。

Abstract: Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome is a cardiac electrophysiology (EP) disorder caused by the presence of an accessory pathway (AP) that bypasses the atrioventricular node, faster ventricular activation rate, and provides a substrate for atrio-ventricular reentrant tachycardia (AVRT). Accurate localization of the AP is critical for planning and guiding catheter ablation procedures. While traditional diagnostic tree (DT) methods and more recent machine learning (ML) approaches have been proposed to predict AP location from surface electrocardiogram (ECG), they are often constrained by limited anatomical localization resolution, poor interpretability, and the use of small clinical datasets. In this study, we present a Deep Learning (DL) model for the localization of single manifest APs across 24 cardiac regions, trained on a large, physiologically realistic database of synthetic ECGs generated using a personalized virtual heart model. We also integrate eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) methods, Guided Backpropagation, Grad-CAM, and Guided Grad-CAM, into the pipeline. This enables interpretation of DL decision-making and addresses one of the main barriers to clinical adoption: lack of transparency in ML predictions. Our model achieves localization accuracy above 95%, with a sensitivity of 94.32% and specificity of 99.78%. XAI outputs are physiologically validated against known depolarization patterns, and a novel index is introduced to identify the most informative ECG leads for AP localization. Results highlight lead V2 as the most critical, followed by aVF, V1, and aVL. This work demonstrates the potential of combining cardiac digital twins with explainable DL to enable accurate, transparent, and non-invasive AP localization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 时间序列插值的基础模型研究尚不充分，TabPFN-TS和MoTM作为时间索引基础模型的出现为这一领域提供了新的可能性，需要系统评估其在零样本设置下的性能。

Method: 在33个域外数据集（约130万个插值窗口）上进行广泛的单变量实验，评估模型在推理时整合协变量以提高准确性的能力，无需微调。

Result: 研究结果表明时间索引基础模型是实现真实世界时间序列通用零样本插值的强大且实用的步骤。

Conclusion: 时间索引基础模型为零样本时间序列插值提供了有效的解决方案，能够在不重新训练的情况下处理各种缺失值恢复场景。

Abstract: Foundation models for time series imputation remain largely unexplored. Recently, two such models, TabPFN-TS and MoTM, have emerged. These models share a common philosophy that places them within the family of time-indexed foundation models. This paper presents the first large-scale empirical study of these models for zero-shot imputation, which enables missing value recovery without retraining across a wide range of scenarios. We conduct extensive univariate experiments across 33 out-of-domain datasets (approximately 1.3M imputation windows) and evaluate their ability to integrate covariates at inference time to improve accuracy without fine-tuning. Our results demonstrate that time-indexed foundation models are a powerful and practical step toward achieving general-purpose, zero-shot imputation for real-world time series.

### [64] [Lethe: Layer- and Time-Adaptive KV Cache Pruning for Reasoning-Intensive LLM Serving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06029)
*Hui Zeng,Daming Zhao,Pengfei Yang,Wenxuan Hou,Tianyang Zheng,Hui Li,Weiye Ji,Jidong Zhai*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Lethe是一个动态KV缓存管理框架，通过空间维度的分层稀疏分配和时间维度的多轮token剪枝来优化长文本生成的推理效率，在保持生成质量的同时显著提升吞吐量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在生成式推理时会产生长解码序列，导致KV缓存占用大量内存和延迟。现有KV压缩方法主要关注减少长输入序列的预填充内存，但无法有效处理长文本生成的动态性和分层敏感性。

Method: Lethe框架在空间维度进行分层稀疏感知分配，根据估计的注意力冗余为每个transformer层分配token剪枝预算；在时间维度通过多轮token剪枝，采用基于注意模式演化的Recency-Aware Selective Retention机制来决定token的保留或淘汰。

Result: 实验结果表明Lethe在不同模型和任务上实现了效率与生成质量的良好平衡，吞吐量最高提升2.56倍。

Conclusion: Lethe通过空间和时间维度的自适应KV缓存管理，有效解决了长文本生成推理中的内存和延迟问题，为生成式推理提供了高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Generative reasoning with large language models (LLMs) often involves long decoding sequences, leading to substantial memory and latency overheads from accumulating key-value (KV) caches. While existing KV compression methods primarily focus on reducing prefill memory from long input sequences, they fall short in addressing the dynamic and layer-sensitive nature of long-form generation, which is central to reasoning tasks. We propose Lethe, a dynamic KV cache management framework that introduces adaptivity along both the spatial and temporal dimensions of decoding. Along the spatial dimension, Lethe performs layerwise sparsity-aware allocation, assigning token pruning budgets to each transformer layer based on estimated attention redundancy. Along the temporal dimension, Lethe conducts multi-round token pruning during generation, driven by a Recency-Aware Selective Retention} (RASR) mechanism. RASR extends traditional recency-based heuristics by also considering token relevance derived from evolving attention patterns, enabling informed decisions about which tokens to retain or evict. Empirical results demonstrate that Lethe achieves a favorable balance between efficiency and generation quality across diverse models and tasks, increases throughput by up to 2.56x.

TL;DR: ITPP是一种新颖的通道独立MTPP架构，通过ODE骨干网络和类型感知反向自注意力机制解耦事件类型信息，显著提升预测准确性和泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MTPP模型使用通道混合策略将不同类型事件信息编码到单一潜在表示中，这种纠缠会模糊类型特定动态，导致性能下降和过拟合风险增加。

Method: 提出通道独立架构，采用编码器-解码器框架和ODE骨干网络，核心是类型感知反向自注意力机制，显式建模异构事件类型间的通道间相关性。

Result: 在多个真实世界和合成数据集上的综合实验表明，ITPP在预测准确性和泛化能力方面持续优于最先进的MTPP模型。

Conclusion: ITPP通过解耦事件类型信息增强了有效性和鲁棒性，同时减少了过拟合，为MTPP建模提供了更优的解决方案。

Abstract: Marked Temporal Point Processes (MTPPs) provide a principled framework for modeling asynchronous event sequences by conditioning on the history of past events. However, most existing MTPP models rely on channel-mixing strategies that encode information from different event types into a single, fixed-size latent representation. This entanglement can obscure type-specific dynamics, leading to performance degradation and increased risk of overfitting. In this work, we introduce ITPP, a novel channel-independent architecture for MTPP modeling that decouples event type information using an encoder-decoder framework with an ODE-based backbone. Central to ITPP is a type-aware inverted self-attention mechanism, designed to explicitly model inter-channel correlations among heterogeneous event types. This architecture enhances effectiveness and robustness while reducing overfitting. Comprehensive experiments on multiple real-world and synthetic datasets demonstrate that ITPP consistently outperforms state-of-the-art MTPP models in both predictive accuracy and generalization.

Abstract: Accurate and efficient global ocean state estimation remains a grand challenge for Earth system science, hindered by the dual bottlenecks of computational scalability and degraded data fidelity in traditional data assimilation (DA) and deep learning (DL) approaches. Here we present an AI-driven Data Assimilation Framework for Ocean (ADAF-Ocean) that directly assimilates multi-source and multi-scale observations, ranging from sparse in-situ measurements to 4 km satellite swaths, without any interpolation or data thinning. Inspired by Neural Processes, ADAF-Ocean learns a continuous mapping from heterogeneous inputs to ocean states, preserving native data fidelity. Through AI-driven super-resolution, it reconstructs 0.25$^\circ$ mesoscale dynamics from coarse 1$^\circ$ fields, which ensures both efficiency and scalability, with just 3.7\% more parameters than the 1$^\circ$ configuration. When coupled with a DL forecasting system, ADAF-Ocean extends global forecast skill by up to 20 days compared to baselines without assimilation. This framework establishes a computationally viable and scientifically rigorous pathway toward real-time, high-resolution Earth system monitoring.

Abstract: We propose a consistency model based on the optimal-transport flow. A physics-informed design of partially input-convex neural networks (PICNN) plays a central role in constructing the flow field that emulates the displacement interpolation. During the training stage, we couple the Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) residual in the OT formulation with the original flow matching loss function. Our approach avoids inner optimization subproblems that are present in previous one-step OFM approaches. During the prediction stage, our approach supports both one-step (Brenier-map) and multi-step ODE sampling from the same learned potential, leveraging the straightness of the OT flow. We validate scalability and performance on standard OT benchmarks.

Conclusion: RBA不仅提供了实用的线性注意力机制，还为自注意力机制的理论建模提供了新工具，有助于未来注意力机制分析研究。

Abstract: Attention mechanism is a significant part of Transformer models. It helps extract features from embedded vectors by adding global information and its expressivity has been proved to be powerful. Nevertheless, the quadratic complexity restricts its practicability. Although several researches have provided attention mechanism in sparse form, they are lack of theoretical analysis about the expressivity of their mechanism while reducing complexity. In this paper, we put forward Random Batch Attention (RBA), a linear self-attention mechanism, which has theoretical support of the ability to maintain its expressivity. Random Batch Attention has several significant strengths as follows: (1) Random Batch Attention has linear time complexity. Other than this, it can be implemented in parallel on a new dimension, which contributes to much memory saving. (2) Random Batch Attention mechanism can improve most of the existing models by replacing their attention mechanisms, even many previously improved attention mechanisms. (3) Random Batch Attention mechanism has theoretical explanation in convergence, as it comes from Random Batch Methods on computation mathematics. Experiments on large graphs have proved advantages mentioned above. Also, the theoretical modeling of self-attention mechanism is a new tool for future research on attention-mechanism analysis.

Conclusion: 该方法揭示了表格数据的严重安全漏洞，在性能和隐蔽性方面超越了现有方法如Tabdoor。

Abstract: Backdoor attacks in machine learning have drawn significant attention for their potential to compromise models stealthily, yet most research has focused on homogeneous data such as images. In this work, we propose a novel backdoor attack on tabular data, which is particularly challenging due to the presence of both numerical and categorical features. Our key idea is a novel technique to convert categorical values into floating-point representations. This approach preserves enough information to maintain clean-model accuracy compared to traditional methods like one-hot or ordinal encoding. By doing this, we create a gradient-based universal perturbation that applies to all features, including categorical ones.
  We evaluate our method on five datasets and four popular models. Our results show up to a 100% attack success rate in both white-box and black-box settings (including real-world applications like Vertex AI), revealing a severe vulnerability for tabular data. Our method is shown to surpass the previous works like Tabdoor in terms of performance, while remaining stealthy against state-of-the-art defense mechanisms. We evaluate our attack against Spectral Signatures, Neural Cleanse, Beatrix, and Fine-Pruning, all of which fail to defend successfully against it. We also verify that our attack successfully bypasses popular outlier detection mechanisms.

Motivation: 短视频推荐系统需要利用极长的用户历史记录，但不能突破延迟或成本预算。现有方法难以在保持低延迟的同时处理10k长度的历史序列。

Method: 1. STCA：用堆叠的目标到历史交叉注意力替换历史自注意力，将复杂度从二次降低到线性；2. RLB：用户中心批处理方案，聚合同一用户的多个目标共享用户侧编码；3. 长度外推训练策略：在较短窗口上训练，在更长窗口上推理。

Conclusion: 该系统为将端到端长序列推荐扩展到10k级别提供了一条实用路径，证明了在保持生产可行性的同时处理极长用户历史的可行性。

Abstract: Short-video recommenders such as Douyin must exploit extremely long user histories without breaking latency or cost budgets. We present an end-to-end system that scales long-sequence modeling to 10k-length histories in production. First, we introduce Stacked Target-to-History Cross Attention (STCA), which replaces history self-attention with stacked cross-attention from the target to the history, reducing complexity from quadratic to linear in sequence length and enabling efficient end-to-end training. Second, we propose Request Level Batching (RLB), a user-centric batching scheme that aggregates multiple targets for the same user/request to share the user-side encoding, substantially lowering sequence-related storage, communication, and compute without changing the learning objective. Third, we design a length-extrapolative training strategy -- train on shorter windows, infer on much longer ones -- so the model generalizes to 10k histories without additional training cost. Across offline and online experiments, we observe predictable, monotonic gains as we scale history length and model capacity, mirroring the scaling law behavior observed in large language models. Deployed at full traffic on Douyin, our system delivers significant improvements on key engagement metrics while meeting production latency, demonstrating a practical path to scaling end-to-end long-sequence recommendation to the 10k regime.

Conclusion: NeuroPOL框架显著降低了计算和功耗需求，能够实现实时可靠性评估，并支持在边缘设备和数字孪生中的高效部署，为高维问题的可靠性分析提供了节能解决方案。

Abstract: Reliability analysis of engineering systems under uncertainty poses significant computational challenges, particularly for problems involving high-dimensional stochastic inputs, nonlinear system responses, and multiphysics couplings. Traditional surrogate modeling approaches often incur high energy consumption, which severely limits their scalability and deployability in resource-constrained environments. We introduce NeuroPOL, \textit{the first neuroscience-inspired physics-informed operator learning framework} for reliability analysis. NeuroPOL incorporates Variable Spiking Neurons into a physics-informed operator architecture, replacing continuous activations with event-driven spiking dynamics. This innovation promotes sparse communication, significantly reduces computational load, and enables an energy-efficient surrogate model. The proposed framework lowers both computational and power demands, supporting real-time reliability assessment and deployment on edge devices and digital twins. By embedding governing physical laws into operator learning, NeuroPOL builds physics-consistent surrogates capable of accurate uncertainty propagation and efficient failure probability estimation, even for high-dimensional problems. We evaluate NeuroPOL on five canonical benchmarks, the Burgers equation, Nagumo equation, two-dimensional Poisson equation, two-dimensional Darcy equation, and incompressible Navier-Stokes equation with energy coupling. Results show that NeuroPOL achieves reliability measures comparable to standard physics-informed operators, while introducing significant communication sparsity, enabling scalable, distributed, and energy-efficient deployment.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning has achieved remarkable success in complex decision-making environments, yet its lack of transparency limits its deployment in practice, especially in safety-critical settings. Shapley values from cooperative game theory provide a principled framework for explaining reinforcement learning; however, the computational cost of Shapley explanations is an obstacle to their use. We introduce FastSVERL, a scalable method for explaining reinforcement learning by approximating Shapley values. FastSVERL is designed to handle the unique challenges of reinforcement learning, including temporal dependencies across multi-step trajectories, learning from off-policy data, and adapting to evolving agent behaviours in real time. FastSVERL introduces a practical, scalable approach for principled and rigorous interpretability in reinforcement learning.

Abstract: Web agents struggle to adapt to new websites due to the scarcity of environment specific tasks and demonstrations. Recent works have explored synthetic data generation to address this challenge, however, they suffer from data quality issues where synthesized tasks contain hallucinations that cannot be executed, and collected trajectories are noisy with redundant or misaligned actions. In this paper, we propose SynthAgent, a fully synthetic supervision framework that aims at improving synthetic data quality via dual refinement of both tasks and trajectories. Our approach begins by synthesizing diverse tasks through categorized exploration of web elements, ensuring efficient coverage of the target environment. During trajectory collection, we refine tasks when conflicts with actual observations are detected, mitigating hallucinations while maintaining task consistency. After collection, we conduct trajectory refinement with a global context to mitigate potential noise or misalignments. Finally, we fine-tune open-source web agents on the refined synthetic data to adapt them to the target environment. Experimental results demonstrate that SynthAgent outperforms existing synthetic data methods, validating the importance of high-quality synthetic supervision.

Abstract: We study the sequential decision-making problem for automated weaning of mechanical circulatory support (MCS) devices in cardiogenic shock patients. MCS devices are percutaneous micro-axial flow pumps that provide left ventricular unloading and forward blood flow, but current weaning strategies vary significantly across care teams and lack data-driven approaches. Offline reinforcement learning (RL) has proven to be successful in sequential decision-making tasks, but our setting presents challenges for training and evaluating traditional offline RL methods: prohibition of online patient interaction, highly uncertain circulatory dynamics due to concurrent treatments, and limited data availability. We developed an end-to-end machine learning framework with two key contributions (1) Clinically-aware OOD-regularized Model-based Policy Optimization (CORMPO), a density-regularized offline RL algorithm for out-of-distribution suppression that also incorporates clinically-informed reward shaping and (2) a Transformer-based probabilistic digital twin that models MCS circulatory dynamics for policy evaluation with rich physiological and clinical metrics. We prove that \textsf{CORMPO} achieves theoretical performance guarantees under mild assumptions. CORMPO attains a higher reward than the offline RL baselines by 28% and higher scores in clinical metrics by 82.6% on real and synthetic datasets. Our approach offers a principled framework for safe offline policy learning in high-stakes medical applications where domain expertise and safety constraints are essential.

Abstract: As learning models continue to grow in size, enabling on-device local training of these models has emerged as a critical challenge in federated learning. A popular solution is sub-model training, where the server only distributes randomly sampled sub-models to the edge clients, and clients only update these small models. However, those random sampling of sub-models may not give satisfying convergence performance. In this paper, observing the success of SGD with shuffling, we propose a distributed shuffled sub-model training, where the full model is partitioned into several sub-models in advance, and the server shuffles those sub-models, sends each of them to clients at each round, and by the end of local updating period, clients send back the updated sub-models, and server averages them. We establish the convergence rate of this algorithm. We also study the generalization of distributed sub-model training via stability analysis, and find that the sub-model training can improve the generalization via amplifying the stability of training process. The extensive experiments also validate our theoretical findings.

Abstract: With the increase of data in day-to-day life, businesses and different stakeholders need to analyze the data for better predictions. Traditionally, relational data has been a source of various insights, but with the increase in computational power and the need to understand deeper relationships between entities, the need to design new techniques has arisen. For this graph data analysis has become an extraordinary tool for understanding the data, which reveals more realistic and flexible modelling of complex relationships. Recently, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have shown great promise in various applications, such as social network analysis, recommendation systems, drug discovery, and more. However, many adversarial attacks can happen over the data, whether during training (poisoning attack) or during testing (evasion attack), which can adversely manipulate the desired outcome from the GNN model. Therefore, it is crucial to make the GNNs robust to such attacks. The existing robustness methods are computationally demanding and perform poorly when the intensity of attack increases. This paper presents a computationally efficient framework, namely, pLAPGNN, based on weighted p-Laplacian for making GNNs robust. Empirical evaluation on real datasets establishes the efficacy and efficiency of the proposed method.

Abstract: A promising alternative to the computationally expensive Neural Architecture Search (NAS) involves the development of \textit{Zero Cost Proxies (ZCPs)}, which correlate well to trained performance, but can be computed through a single forward/backward pass on a randomly sampled batch of data. In this paper, we investigate the effectiveness of ZCPs for HAR on six benchmark datasets, and demonstrate that they discover network architectures that obtain within 5\% of performance attained by full scale training involving 1500 randomly sampled architectures. This results in substantial computational savings as high performing architectures can be discovered with minimal training. Our experiments not only introduce ZCPs to sensor-based HAR, but also demonstrate that they are robust to data noise, further showcasing their suitability for practical scenarios.

Abstract: Transfer learning of tabular data is non-trivial due to heterogeneity in the feature space across disparate domains. The limited success of traditional deep learning in tabular knowledge transfer can be advanced by leveraging large language models (LLMs). However, the efficacy of LLMs often stagnates for mixed data types structured in tables due to the limitations of text prompts and in-context learning. We propose a lightweight transfer learning framework that fine-tunes an LLM using source tabular data and transplants the LLM's selective $key$ and $value$ projection weights into a gated feature tokenized transformer (gFTT) built for tabular data. The gFTT model with cross-domain attention is fine-tuned using target tabular data for transfer learning, eliminating the need for shared features, LLM prompt engineering, and large-scale pretrained models. Our experiments using ten pairs of source-target data sets and 12 baselines demonstrate the superiority of the proposed LLM-attention transplant for transfer learning (LATTLE) method over traditional ML models, state-of-the-art deep tabular architectures, and transfer learning models trained on thousands to billions of tabular samples. The proposed attention transfer demonstrates an effective solution to learning relationships between data tables using an LLM in a low-resource learning environment. The source code for the proposed method is publicly available.

Abstract: We study the problem of learning the topology of a directed Gaussian Graphical Model under the equal-variance assumption, where the graph has $n$ nodes and maximum in-degree $d$. Prior work has established that $O(d \log n)$ samples are sufficient for this task. However, an important factor that is often overlooked in these analyses is the dependence on the condition number of the covariance matrix of the model. Indeed, all algorithms from prior work require a number of samples that grows polynomially with this condition number. In many cases this is unsatisfactory, since the condition number could grow polynomially with $n$, rendering these prior approaches impractical in high-dimensional settings. In this work, we provide an algorithm that recovers the underlying graph and prove that the number of samples required is independent of the condition number. Furthermore, we establish lower bounds that nearly match the upper bound up to a $d$-factor, thus providing an almost tight characterization of the true sample complexity of the problem. Moreover, under a further assumption that all the variances of the variables are bounded, we design a polynomial-time algorithm that recovers the underlying graph, at the cost of an additional polynomial dependence of the sample complexity on $d$. We complement our theoretical findings with simulations on synthetic datasets that confirm our predictions.

Abstract: Federated learning on clients with noisy labels is a challenging problem, as such clients can infiltrate the global model, impacting the overall generalizability of the system. Existing methods proposed to handle noisy clients assume that a sufficient number of clients with clean labels are available, which can be leveraged to learn a robust global model while dampening the impact of noisy clients. This assumption fails when a high number of heterogeneous clients contain noisy labels, making the existing approaches ineffective. In such scenarios, it is important to locally regularize the clients before communication with the global model, to ensure the global model isn't corrupted by noisy clients. While pre-trained self-supervised models can be effective for local regularization, existing centralized approaches relying on pretrained initialization are impractical in a federated setting due to the potentially large size of these models, which increases communication costs. In that line, we propose a regularization objective for client models that decouples the pre-trained and classification models by enforcing similarity between close data points within the client. We leverage the representation space of a self-supervised pretrained model to evaluate the closeness among examples. This regularization, when applied with the standard objective function for the downstream task in standard noisy federated settings, significantly improves performance, outperforming existing state-of-the-art federated methods in multiple computer vision and medical image classification benchmarks. Unlike other techniques that rely on self-supervised pretrained initialization, our method does not require the pretrained model and classifier backbone to share the same architecture, making it architecture-agnostic.

Abstract: Supply chains are integral to global economic stability, yet disruptions can swiftly propagate through interconnected networks, resulting in substantial economic impacts. Accurate and timely inference of supply chain resilience the capability to maintain core functions during disruptions is crucial for proactive risk mitigation and robust network design. However, existing approaches lack effective mechanisms to infer supply chain resilience without explicit system dynamics and struggle to represent the higher-order, multi-entity dependencies inherent in supply chain networks. These limitations motivate the definition of a novel problem and the development of targeted modeling solutions. To address these challenges, we formalize a novel problem: Supply Chain Resilience Inference (SCRI), defined as predicting supply chain resilience using hypergraph topology and observed inventory trajectories without explicit dynamic equations. To solve this problem, we propose the Supply Chain Resilience Inference Hypergraph Network (SC-RIHN), a novel hypergraph-based model leveraging set-based encoding and hypergraph message passing to capture multi-party firm-product interactions. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that SC-RIHN significantly outperforms traditional MLP, representative graph neural network variants, and ResInf baselines across synthetic benchmarks, underscoring its potential for practical, early-warning risk assessment in complex supply chain systems.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一个针对稀疏线性回归问题的通用正结果，能够在任意设计矩阵X下，通过多项式样本量和运行时间实现小预测误差，前提是稀疏信号w*的支持集是随机选择的。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 稀疏线性回归在信息理论上需要O(k log d/ε)样本量，但现有算法要么需要指数运行时间，要么需要O(d)样本量。计算效率与样本效率之间存在指数级差距，需要找到能在多项式时间内处理o(d)样本量的方法。

Method: 针对任意设计矩阵X，假设稀疏信号w*的支持集是随机选择的，使用多项式样本量N = poly(k, log d, 1/ε)和多项式运行时间poly(d,N)来估计w*，适用于条件数高达2^poly(d)的矩阵。

Result: 首次证明了对于任意设计矩阵X，在随机稀疏支持集的假设下，可以用poly(k, log d, 1/ε)样本量和poly(d,N)运行时间实现预测误差ε。

Conclusion: 这项工作填补了稀疏线性回归中计算效率与样本效率之间的重要空白，为处理任意设计矩阵提供了首个通用正结果，突破了以往方法对随机设计矩阵或特殊结构矩阵的限制。

Abstract: Sparse linear regression is one of the most basic questions in machine learning and statistics. Here, we are given as input a design matrix $X \in \mathbb{R}^{N \times d}$ and measurements or labels ${y} \in \mathbb{R}^N$ where ${y} = {X} {w}^* + ξ$, and $ξ$ is the noise in the measurements. Importantly, we have the additional constraint that the unknown signal vector ${w}^*$ is sparse: it has $k$ non-zero entries where $k$ is much smaller than the ambient dimension. Our goal is to output a prediction vector $\widehat{w}$ that has small prediction error: $\frac{1}{N}\cdot \|{X} {w}^* - {X} \widehat{w}\|^2_2$.
  Information-theoretically, we know what is best possible in terms of measurements: under most natural noise distributions, we can get prediction error at most $ε$ with roughly $N = O(k \log d/ε)$ samples. Computationally, this currently needs $d^{Ω(k)}$ run-time. Alternately, with $N = O(d)$, we can get polynomial-time. Thus, there is an exponential gap (in the dependence on $d$) between the two and we do not know if it is possible to get $d^{o(k)}$ run-time and $o(d)$ samples.
  We give the first generic positive result for worst-case design matrices ${X}$: For any ${X}$, we show that if the support of ${w}^*$ is chosen at random, we can get prediction error $ε$ with $N = \text{poly}(k, \log d, 1/ε)$ samples and run-time $\text{poly}(d,N)$. This run-time holds for any design matrix ${X}$ with condition number up to $2^{\text{poly}(d)}$.
  Previously, such results were known for worst-case ${w}^*$, but only for random design matrices from well-behaved families, matrices that have a very low condition number ($\text{poly}(\log d)$; e.g., as studied in compressed sensing), or those with special structural properties.

Method: 使用分数阶连续动力学，通过变化分数导数阶数α∈(0,1]产生连续谱的视图：小α产生局部特征，大α诱导更广泛的全局聚合。将α作为可学习参数，使模型能够自适应扩散尺度并自动发现信息丰富的视图。

Abstract: Graph contrastive learning (GCL) learns node and graph representations by contrasting multiple views of the same graph. Existing methods typically rely on fixed, handcrafted views-usually a local and a global perspective, which limits their ability to capture multi-scale structural patterns. We present an augmentation-free, multi-view GCL framework grounded in fractional-order continuous dynamics. By varying the fractional derivative order $α\in (0,1]$, our encoders produce a continuous spectrum of views: small $α$ yields localized features, while large $α$ induces broader, global aggregation. We treat $α$ as a learnable parameter so the model can adapt diffusion scales to the data and automatically discover informative views. This principled approach generates diverse, complementary representations without manual augmentations. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate that our method produces more robust and expressive embeddings and outperforms state-of-the-art GCL baselines.

Abstract: This paper focuses on dynamic origin-destination matrix estimation (DODE), a crucial calibration process necessary for the effective application of microscopic traffic simulations. The fundamental challenge of the DODE problem in microscopic simulations stems from the complex temporal dynamics and inherent uncertainty of individual vehicle dynamics. This makes it highly challenging to precisely determine which vehicle traverses which link at any given moment, resulting in intricate and often ambiguous relationships between origin-destination (OD) matrices and their contributions to resultant link flows. This phenomenon constitutes the credit assignment problem, a central challenge addressed in this study. We formulate the DODE problem as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and propose a novel framework that applies model-free deep reinforcement learning (DRL). Within our proposed framework, the agent learns an optimal policy to sequentially generate OD matrices, refining its strategy through direct interaction with the simulation environment. The proposed method is validated on the Nguyen-Dupuis network using SUMO, where its performance is evaluated against ground-truth link flows aggregated at 5-minute intervals over a 30-minute horizon. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves a 43.2% reduction in mean squared error (MSE) compared to the best-performing conventional baseline. By reframing DODE as a sequential decision-making problem, our approach addresses the credit assignment challenge through its learned policy, thereby overcoming the limitations of conventional methods and proposing a novel framework for calibration of microscopic traffic simulations.

Abstract: Human-computer interaction increasingly demands systems that recognize not only explicit user inputs but also implicit emotional states. While substantial progress has been made in affective computing, most emotion recognition systems rely on cloud-based inference, introducing privacy vulnerabilities and latency constraints unsuitable for real-time applications. This work presents a comprehensive evaluation of machine learning architectures for on-device emotion recognition from wrist-based photoplethysmography (PPG), systematically comparing different models spanning classical ensemble methods, deep neural networks, and transformers on the WESAD stress detection dataset. Results demonstrate that classical ensemble methods substantially outperform deep learning on small physiological datasets, with ExtraTrees achieving F1 = 0.826 on combined features and F1 = 0.623 on wrist-only features, compared to transformers achieving only F1 = 0.509-0.577. We deploy the wrist-only ExtraTrees model optimized via ONNX conversion, achieving a 4.08 MB footprint, 0.05 ms inference latency, and 152x speedup over the original implementation. Furthermore, ONNX optimization yields a 30.5% average storage reduction and 40.1x inference speedup, highlighting the feasibility of privacy-preserving on-device emotion recognition for real-world wearables.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个统一的理论框架，将缩放定律与transformer中的上下文学习涌现联系起来，揭示了ICL性能与模型深度、宽度、上下文长度和训练数据之间的幂律关系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管已有大量实证研究，但对大规模上下文学习涌现的理论理解仍然不足，需要建立连接缩放定律与ICL涌现的统一定理框架。

Method: 建立理论框架分析transformer在特定条件下如何在前向传播中实现基于梯度的元学习，推导ICL性能与模型参数的幂律关系，并进行系统实验验证。

Result: 理论预测与实验测量结果高度一致，发现了临界尺度处的急剧相变，并推导出最优深度-宽度分配比例L* ∝ N^{2/3}, d* ∝ N^{1/3}。

Conclusion: 该工作为ICL涌现提供了必要和充分条件，并建立了transformer在上下文中学习能力的基本计算极限。

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) enables large language models to adapt to new tasks from demonstrations without parameter updates. Despite extensive empirical studies, a principled understanding of ICL emergence at scale remains more elusive. We present a unified theoretical framework connecting scaling laws to ICL emergence in transformers. Our analysis establishes that ICL performance follows power-law relationships with model depth $L$, width $d$, context length $k$, and training data $D$, with exponents determined by task structure. We show that under specific conditions, transformers implement gradient-based metalearning in their forward pass, with an effective learning rate $η_{\text{eff}} = Θ(1/\sqrt{Ld})$. We demonstrate sharp phase transitions at critical scales and derive optimal depth-width allocations favoring $L^* \propto N^{2/3}$, $d^* \propto N^{1/3}$ for the fixed parameter budget $N = Ld$. Systematic experiments on synthetic tasks validate our predictions, with measured scaling exponents closely matching theory. This work provides both necessary and sufficient conditions for the emergence of ICLs and establishes fundamental computational limits on what transformers can learn in-context.

Conclusion: MoSEs框架有效解决了LLMs持续学习中的关键挑战，实现了最小化遗忘和高效可扩展性，为持续学习提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Adapting Large Language Models (LLMs) to a continuous stream of tasks is a critical yet challenging endeavor. While Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods have become a standard for this, they face a fundamental dilemma in continual learning. Reusing a single set of PEFT parameters for new tasks often leads to catastrophic forgetting of prior knowledge. Conversely, allocating distinct parameters for each task prevents forgetting but results in a linear growth of the model's size and fails to facilitate knowledge transfer between related tasks. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel adaptive PEFT method referred to as \textit{Mixtures of SubExperts (MoSEs)}, a novel continual learning framework designed for minimal forgetting and efficient scalability. MoSEs integrate a sparse Mixture of SubExperts into the transformer layers, governed by a task-specific routing mechanism. This architecture allows the model to isolate and protect knowledge within dedicated SubExperts, thereby minimizing parameter interference and catastrophic forgetting. Crucially, the router can adaptively select and combine previously learned sparse parameters for new tasks, enabling effective knowledge transfer while ensuring that the model's capacity grows sublinearly. We evaluate MoSEs on the comprehensive TRACE benchmark datasets. Our experiments demonstrate that MoSEs significantly outperform conventional continual learning approaches in both knowledge retention and scalability to new tasks, achieving state-of-the-art performance with substantial memory and computational savings.

Abstract: This paper studies optimization proxies, machine learning (ML) models trained to efficiently predict optimal solutions for AC Optimal Power Flow (ACOPF) problems. While promising, optimization proxy performance heavily depends on training data quality. To address this limitation, this paper introduces a novel active sampling framework for ACOPF optimization proxies designed to generate realistic and diverse training data. The framework actively explores varied, flexible problem specifications reflecting plausible operational realities. More importantly, the approach uses optimization-specific quantities (active constraint sets) that better capture the salient features of an ACOPF that lead to the optimal solution. Numerical results show superior generalization over existing sampling methods with an equivalent training budget, significantly advancing the state-of-practice for trustworthy ACOPF optimization proxies.

Result: 大量实验表明IEC在各种数据集、效率技术和模型架构上都能一致提高生成质量。

Conclusion: IEC是一个实用且可泛化的解决方案，能够无缝集成到现有扩散模型的推理过程中，实现性能与效率的灵活权衡。

Abstract: With the growing demand for high-quality image generation on resource-constrained devices, efficient diffusion models have received increasing attention. However, such models suffer from approximation errors introduced by efficiency techniques, which significantly degrade generation quality. Once deployed, these errors are difficult to correct, as modifying the model is typically infeasible in deployment environments. Through an analysis of error propagation across diffusion timesteps, we reveal that these approximation errors can accumulate exponentially, severely impairing output quality. Motivated by this insight, we propose Iterative Error Correction (IEC), a novel test-time method that mitigates inference-time errors by iteratively refining the model's output. IEC is theoretically proven to reduce error propagation from exponential to linear growth, without requiring any retraining or architectural changes. IEC can seamlessly integrate into the inference process of existing diffusion models, enabling a flexible trade-off between performance and efficiency. Extensive experiments show that IEC consistently improves generation quality across various datasets, efficiency techniques, and model architectures, establishing it as a practical and generalizable solution for test-time enhancement of efficient diffusion models.

Abstract: Model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) is a crucial approach to enhance the generalization capabilities and improve the sample efficiency of RL algorithms. However, current MBRL methods focus primarily on building world models for single tasks and rarely address generalization across different scenarios. Building on the insight that dynamics within the same simulation engine share inherent properties, we attempt to construct a unified world model capable of generalizing across different scenarios, named Meta-Regularized Contextual World-Model (MrCoM). This method first decomposes the latent state space into various components based on the dynamic characteristics, thereby enhancing the accuracy of world-model prediction. Further, MrCoM adopts meta-state regularization to extract unified representation of scenario-relevant information, and meta-value regularization to align world-model optimization with policy learning across diverse scenario objectives. We theoretically analyze the generalization error upper bound of MrCoM in multi-scenario settings. We systematically evaluate our algorithm's generalization ability across diverse scenarios, demonstrating significantly better performance than previous state-of-the-art methods.

Motivation: 现有质谱检索方法存在谱库覆盖范围有限和跨模态对齐不佳的问题，导致检索精度和泛化性能不理想。

Method: 采用两阶段框架：预检索阶段使用对比学习模型识别候选分子作为上下文先验；生成检索阶段整合候选分子和输入质谱，通过生成模型产生精炼分子结构并重新排序候选。

Conclusion: GLMR框架通过缓解跨模态对齐问题，为质谱数据的高效分子结构检索提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Retrieving molecular structures from tandem mass spectra is a crucial step in rapid compound identification. Existing retrieval methods, such as traditional mass spectral library matching, suffer from limited spectral library coverage, while recent cross-modal representation learning frameworks often encounter modality misalignment, resulting in suboptimal retrieval accuracy and generalization. To address these limitations, we propose GLMR, a Generative Language Model-based Retrieval framework that mitigates the cross-modal misalignment through a two-stage process. In the pre-retrieval stage, a contrastive learning-based model identifies top candidate molecules as contextual priors for the input mass spectrum. In the generative retrieval stage, these candidate molecules are integrated with the input mass spectrum to guide a generative model in producing refined molecular structures, which are then used to re-rank the candidates based on molecular similarity. Experiments on both MassSpecGym and the proposed MassRET-20k dataset demonstrate that GLMR significantly outperforms existing methods, achieving over 40% improvement in top-1 accuracy and exhibiting strong generalizability.

Conclusion: CAMP-HiVe方法通过动态自适应框架实现了计算效率与模型性能的良好平衡，为资源受限环境下的神经网络部署提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Deep learning algorithms are becoming an essential component of many artificial intelligence (AI) driven applications, many of which run on resource-constrained and energy-constrained systems. For efficient deployment of these algorithms, although different techniques for the compression of neural network models are proposed, neural pruning is one of the fastest and effective methods, which can provide a high compression gain with minimal cost. To harness enhanced performance gain with respect to model complexity, we propose a novel neural network pruning approach utilizing Hessian-vector products that approximate crucial curvature information in the loss function, which significantly reduces the computation demands. By employing a power iteration method, our algorithm effectively identifies and preserves the essential information, ensuring a balanced trade-off between model accuracy and computational efficiency. Herein, we introduce CAMP-HiVe, a cyclic pair merging-based pruning with Hessian Vector approximation by iteratively consolidating weight pairs, combining significant and less significant weights, thus effectively streamlining the model while preserving its performance. This dynamic, adaptive framework allows for real-time adjustment of weight significance, ensuring that only the most critical parameters are retained. Our experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method achieves significant reductions in computational requirements while maintaining high performance across different neural network architectures, e.g., ResNet18, ResNet56, and MobileNetv2, on standard benchmark datasets, e.g., CIFAR10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet, and it outperforms the existing state-of-the-art neural pruning methods.

Abstract: Drug-target interaction (DTI) prediction is of great significance for drug discovery and drug repurposing. With the accumulation of a large volume of valuable data, data-driven methods have been increasingly harnessed to predict DTIs, reducing costs across various dimensions. Therefore, this paper proposes a $\textbf{L}$arge $\textbf{L}$anguage $\textbf{M}$odel and $\textbf{M}$ulti-$\textbf{M}$odel data co-powered $\textbf{D}$rug $\textbf{T}$arget $\textbf{I}$nteraction prediction framework, named LLM$^3$-DTI. LLM$^3$-DTI constructs multi-modal data embedding to enhance DTI prediction performance. In this framework, the text semantic embeddings of drugs and targets are encoded by a domain-specific LLM. To effectively align and fuse multi-modal embedding. We propose the dual cross-attention mechanism and the TSFusion module. Finally, these multi-modal data are utilized for the DTI task through an output network. The experimental results indicate that LLM$^3$-DTI can proficiently identify validated DTIs, surpassing the performance of the models employed for comparison across diverse scenarios. Consequently, LLM$^3$-DTI is adept at fulfilling the task of DTI prediction with excellence. The data and code are available at https://github.com/chaser-gua/LLM3DTI.

Result: 在电力现货市场和金融市场的广泛实验中，COTN比最先进的深度学习模型Informer性能提升高达17%，比传统统计方法GARCH提升高达40%。

Conclusion: COTN在应对现实世界市场不确定性和复杂性方面表现出色，为在压力条件下预测高波动系统提供了强大工具。

Abstract: Accurate prediction of financial and electricity markets, especially under extreme conditions, remains a significant challenge due to their intrinsic nonlinearity, rapid fluctuations, and chaotic patterns. To address these limitations, we propose the Chaotic Oscillatory Transformer Network (COTN). COTN innovatively combines a Transformer architecture with a novel Lee Oscillator activation function, processed through Max-over-Time pooling and a lambda-gating mechanism. This design is specifically tailored to effectively capture chaotic dynamics and improve responsiveness during periods of heightened volatility, where conventional activation functions (e.g., ReLU, GELU) tend to saturate. Furthermore, COTN incorporates an Autoencoder Self-Regressive (ASR) module to detect and isolate abnormal market patterns, such as sudden price spikes or crashes, thereby preventing corruption of the core prediction process and enhancing robustness. Extensive experiments across electricity spot markets and financial markets demonstrate the practical applicability and resilience of COTN. Our approach outperforms state-of-the-art deep learning models like Informer by up to 17% and traditional statistical methods like GARCH by as much as 40%. These results underscore COTN's effectiveness in navigating real-world market uncertainty and complexity, offering a powerful tool for forecasting highly volatile systems under duress.

Abstract: As machine learning systems become increasingly integrated into human-centered domains such as healthcare, ensuring fairness while maintaining high predictive performance is critical. Existing bias mitigation techniques often impose a trade-off between fairness and accuracy, inadvertently degrading performance for certain demographic groups. In high-stakes domains like clinical diagnosis, such trade-offs are ethically and practically unacceptable. In this study, we propose a fairness-without-harm approach by learning distinct representations for different demographic groups and selectively applying demographic experts consisting of group-specific representations and personalized classifiers through a no-harm constrained selection. We evaluate our approach on three real-world medical datasets -- covering eye disease, skin cancer, and X-ray diagnosis -- as well as two face datasets. Extensive empirical results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in achieving fairness without harm.

Conclusion: LinearNO通过重新设计注意力机制，在保持性能的同时显著提升了效率，证明了线性注意力在PDE求解中的有效性。

Abstract: Recent advances in Transformer-based Neural Operators have enabled significant progress in data-driven solvers for Partial Differential Equations (PDEs). Most current research has focused on reducing the quadratic complexity of attention to address the resulting low training and inference efficiency. Among these works, Transolver stands out as a representative method that introduces Physics-Attention to reduce computational costs. Physics-Attention projects grid points into slices for slice attention, then maps them back through deslicing. However, we observe that Physics-Attention can be reformulated as a special case of linear attention, and that the slice attention may even hurt the model performance. Based on these observations, we argue that its effectiveness primarily arises from the slice and deslice operations rather than interactions between slices. Building on this insight, we propose a two-step transformation to redesign Physics-Attention into a canonical linear attention, which we call Linear Attention Neural Operator (LinearNO). Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on six standard PDE benchmarks, while reducing the number of parameters by an average of 40.0% and computational cost by 36.2%. Additionally, it delivers superior performance on two challenging, industrial-level datasets: AirfRANS and Shape-Net Car.

Conclusion: 3dSAGER通过专注于3D空间对象的内在几何特性，解决了跨数据集实体解析的挑战，特别是在坐标系不兼容的情况下表现出色。

Abstract: Urban environments are continuously mapped and modeled by various data collection platforms, including satellites, unmanned aerial vehicles and street cameras. The growing availability of 3D geospatial data from multiple modalities has introduced new opportunities and challenges for integrating spatial knowledge at scale, particularly in high-impact domains such as urban planning and rapid disaster management. Geospatial entity resolution is the task of identifying matching spatial objects across different datasets, often collected independently under varying conditions. Existing approaches typically rely on spatial proximity, textual metadata, or external identifiers to determine correspondence. While useful, these signals are often unavailable, unreliable, or misaligned, especially in cross-source scenarios. To address these limitations, we shift the focus to the intrinsic geometry of 3D spatial objects and present 3dSAGER (3D Spatial-Aware Geospatial Entity Resolution), an end-to-end pipeline for geospatial entity resolution over 3D objects. 3dSAGER introduces a novel, spatial-reference-independent featurization mechanism that captures intricate geometric characteristics of matching pairs, enabling robust comparison even across datasets with incompatible coordinate systems where traditional spatial methods fail. As a key component of 3dSAGER, we also propose a new lightweight and interpretable blocking method, BKAFI, that leverages a trained model to efficiently generate high-recall candidate sets. We validate 3dSAGER through extensive experiments on real-world urban datasets, demonstrating significant gains in both accuracy and efficiency over strong baselines. Our empirical study further dissects the contributions of each component, providing insights into their impact and the overall design choices.

Abstract: Since 2010, Kaggle has been a platform where data scientists from around the world come together to compete, collaborate, and push the boundaries of Data Science. Over these 15 years, it has grown from a purely competition-focused site into a broader ecosystem with forums, notebooks, models, datasets, and more. With the release of the Kaggle Meta Code and Kaggle Meta Datasets, we now have a unique opportunity to explore these competitions, technologies, and real-world applications of Machine Learning and AI. And so in this study, we take a closer look at 15 years of data science on Kaggle - through metadata, shared code, community discussions, and the competitions themselves. We explore Kaggle's growth, its impact on the data science community, uncover hidden technological trends, analyze competition winners, how Kagglers approach problems in general, and more. We do this by analyzing millions of kernels and discussion threads to perform both longitudinal trend analysis and standard exploratory data analysis. Our findings show that Kaggle is a steadily growing platform with increasingly diverse use cases, and that Kagglers are quick to adapt to new trends and apply them to real-world challenges, while producing - on average - models with solid generalization capabilities. We also offer a snapshot of the platform as a whole, highlighting its history and technological evolution.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种用于竞争性编程代码生成的强化学习与验证（RLVR）方法，通过两阶段训练流程和精心设计的数据集构建策略，在Qwen2.5-32B模型上实现了最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前推理优先模型的发展重新激发了RLVR的兴趣，但进展主要集中在数学领域，竞争性编程代码生成研究不足，且数据整理受到的关注少于RL算法设计。

Method: 采用监督微调（SFT）后接两阶段RL训练：第一阶段使用GRPO在大量均匀分布的竞争性编程问题上训练，第二阶段在少量高质量挑战性问题上进行Pre-GRPO训练，采用硬焦点课程设计。

Result: 在LeetCode和Codeforces周赛中评估，该模型在相似规模模型中达到最先进性能，与DeepSeek v3.1和Doubao-1.5-Thinking等领先系统相当。

Conclusion: 研究提炼了竞争性编程代码生成中数据整理、熵扩展和课程设计的简明最佳实践，并观察到在大规模MoE模型上RL具有良好的扩展性。

Abstract: Recent reasoning-first models (e.g., OpenAI o1, DeepSeek R1) have spurred a resurgence of interest in RLVR. Nevertheless, advances are dominated by mathematics (e.g., AIME), with competitive-programming code generation underexplored and data curation receiving less attention than RL algorithm design. We investigate how to construct RLVR datasets (i.e., RL prompts) and present practical training techniques that yield strong performance on competitive-programming code generation. Our pipeline begins with supervised fine-tuning (SFT) distilled from strong open-source models, augmented with general-purpose and reasoning-intensive data. RL then follows a two-stage process with executable, testcase-driven rewards: first, training on a large, uniformly distributed set of competitive-programming problems using Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with 8 rollouts per prompt and a relatively short response-generation window (e.g., 32k during SFT and 24k in this stage) to expand entropy and mitigate repetition and truncation; second, we perform \textbf{Pre-GRPO}: updating on a small, high-quality set of challenging problems with a large rollout budget (64 rollouts per prompt) under a hard-focus curriculum that continuously retains the most difficult instances throughout training. We implement our method on Qwen2.5-32B and evaluate on LeetCode and Codeforces weekly contests to avoid data leakage. The resulting model achieves state-of-the-art performance among models of similar scale and is comparable to leading systems such as DeepSeek v3.1 and Doubao-1.5-Thinking. We also examine scaling trends and observe strong RL scaling on an internal large-scale MoE model. Our study distills concise best practices for data curation, entropy expansion, and curriculum design in RLVR for competitive-programming code generation.

Conclusion: 所提出的框架通过线性边界传播和自适应细化策略，有效解决了神经网络CBF验证的计算瓶颈问题，实现了对更大规模网络的验证能力。

Abstract: Control barrier functions (CBFs) are a popular tool for safety certification of nonlinear dynamical control systems. Recently, CBFs represented as neural networks have shown great promise due to their expressiveness and applicability to a broad class of dynamics and safety constraints. However, verifying that a trained neural network is indeed a valid CBF is a computational bottleneck that limits the size of the networks that can be used. To overcome this limitation, we present a novel framework for verifying neural CBFs based on piecewise linear upper and lower bounds on the conditions required for a neural network to be a CBF. Our approach is rooted in linear bound propagation (LBP) for neural networks, which we extend to compute bounds on the gradients of the network. Combined with McCormick relaxation, we derive linear upper and lower bounds on the CBF conditions, thereby eliminating the need for computationally expensive verification procedures. Our approach applies to arbitrary control-affine systems and a broad range of nonlinear activation functions. To reduce conservatism, we develop a parallelizable refinement strategy that adaptively refines the regions over which these bounds are computed. Our approach scales to larger neural networks than state-of-the-art verification procedures for CBFs, as demonstrated by our numerical experiments.

TL;DR: ReaDISH是一个新颖的化学反应预测模型，通过对称差异shingle编码和几何结构交互注意力机制，解决了现有模型对输入排列敏感和子结构交互建模不足的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有机器学习模型在化学反应预测中存在两个关键局限：对输入排列（分子/原子顺序）的敏感性，以及对控制反应性的子结构交互建模不足，导致预测不一致和泛化能力差。

Method: 提出ReaDISH模型，包含两个创新：1) 对称差异shingle编码，计算分子shingle差异以捕捉反应特异性结构变化并消除顺序敏感性；2) 几何结构交互注意力机制，在shingle级别建模分子内和分子间交互。

Result: 大量实验表明，ReaDISH在多个基准测试中提升了反应预测性能，在排列扰动下R²平均提高了8.76%，显示出更强的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: ReaDISH通过引入排列不变表示和交互感知特征，有效解决了化学反应预测中的关键挑战，提高了模型的鲁棒性和预测性能。

Abstract: Chemical reaction prediction remains a fundamental challenge in organic chemistry, where existing machine learning models face two critical limitations: sensitivity to input permutations (molecule/atom orderings) and inadequate modeling of substructural interactions governing reactivity. These shortcomings lead to inconsistent predictions and poor generalization to real-world scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose ReaDISH, a novel reaction prediction model that learns permutation-invariant representations while incorporating interaction-aware features. It introduces two innovations: (1) symmetric difference shingle encoding, which computes molecular shingle differences to capture reaction-specific structural changes while eliminating order sensitivity; and (2) geometry-structure interaction attention, a mechanism that models intra- and inter-molecular interactions at the shingle level. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ReaDISH improves reaction prediction performance across diverse benchmarks. It shows enhanced robustness with an average improvement of 8.76% on R$^2$ under permutation perturbations.

TL;DR: FedFair-Traffic是一个保护隐私的联邦学习框架，首次同时优化交通效率、公平性和隐私保护，在METR-LA数据集上显示能减少7%平均出行时间，提升73%交通公平性，并提供高隐私保护。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前集中式交通管理方案侵犯用户位置隐私并加剧交通不平等，而现有联邦学习框架未考虑多目标交通设置中的公平约束。

Method: 结合图神经网络与差分隐私机制（ε-隐私保证）和基于基尼系数的公平约束，使用多目标优化方法，通过梯度裁剪和噪声注入实现联邦聚合。

Result: 相比集中式基线，平均出行时间减少7%（14.2分钟），交通公平性提升73%（基尼系数0.78），隐私保护得分0.8，通信开销减少89%。

Conclusion: FedFair-Traffic是一个可扩展的隐私感知智慧城市基础设施，适用于大都市交通流控制和联邦交通网络。

Abstract: The optimization of urban traffic is threatened by the complexity of achieving a balance between transport efficiency and the maintenance of privacy, as well as the equitable distribution of traffic based on socioeconomically diverse neighborhoods. Current centralized traffic management schemes invade user location privacy and further entrench traffic disparity by offering disadvantaged route suggestions, whereas current federated learning frameworks do not consider fairness constraints in multi-objective traffic settings. This study presents a privacy-preserving federated learning framework, termed FedFair-Traffic, that jointly and simultaneously optimizes travel efficiency, traffic fairness, and differential privacy protection. This is the first attempt to integrate three conflicting objectives to improve urban transportation systems. The proposed methodology enables collaborative learning between related vehicles with data locality by integrating Graph Neural Networks with differential privacy mechanisms ($ε$-privacy guarantees) and Gini coefficient-based fair constraints using multi-objective optimization. The framework uses federated aggregation methods of gradient clipping and noise injection to provide differential privacy and optimize Pareto-efficient solutions for the efficiency-fairness tradeoff. Real-world comprehensive experiments on the METR-LA traffic dataset showed that FedFair-Traffic can reduce the average travel time by 7\% (14.2 minutes) compared with their centralized baselines, promote traffic fairness by 73\% (Gini coefficient, 0.78), and offer high privacy protection (privacy score, 0.8) with an 89\% reduction in communication overhead. These outcomes demonstrate that FedFair-Traffic is a scalable privacy-aware smart city infrastructure with possible use-cases in metropolitan traffic flow control and federated transportation networks.

Motivation: 在搜索、广告和推荐领域的CTR和CVR估计模型中，基于大规模稀疏分类特征的模型在多轮训练时经常出现性能显著下降的问题，现有研究未能明确识别这一现象的根本原因。

Method: 首先对大规模稀疏分类特征导致过拟合的原因进行理论分析，然后基于分析提出一种自适应正则化方法。

Result: 该方法不仅防止了多轮训练中观察到的严重性能下降，还提高了单轮训练中的模型性能，并已在在线生产系统中部署。

Conclusion: 通过理论分析识别了大规模稀疏分类特征导致过拟合的根本原因，提出的自适应正则化方法有效解决了这一问题，并在实际应用中验证了其有效性。

Abstract: The one-epoch overfitting problem has drawn widespread attention, especially in CTR and CVR estimation models in search, advertising, and recommendation domains. These models which rely heavily on large-scale sparse categorical features, often suffer a significant decline in performance when trained for multiple epochs. Although recent studies have proposed heuristic solutions, they have not clearly identified the fundamental cause of this phenomenon. In this work, we provide a theoretical analysis that explains why overfitting occurs in models that use large-scale sparse categorical features. Based on this analysis, we propose an adaptive regularization method to address it. Our approach not only prevents the severe performance degradation observed during multi-epoch training, but also improves model performance within a single epoch. This method has already been deployed in online production systems.

Motivation: 探讨Transformer在词汇表上下文学习场景下的函数逼近能力，特别关注位置编码对通用逼近性质的影响。

Method: 理论分析单层Transformer在有无位置编码情况下的函数逼近能力，提供了位置编码实现UAP的充分条件。

Result: 无位置编码的单层Transformer在VICL场景下不具备UAP，但加入适当的位置编码后可以实现UAP。

Conclusion: 位置编码在上下文学习中具有重要的理论价值，能够增强模型的函数逼近能力。

Abstract: Numerous studies have demonstrated that the Transformer architecture possesses the capability for in-context learning (ICL). In scenarios involving function approximation, context can serve as a control parameter for the model, endowing it with the universal approximation property (UAP). In practice, context is represented by tokens from a finite set, referred to as a vocabulary, which is the case considered in this paper, \emph{i.e.}, vocabulary in-context learning (VICL). We demonstrate that VICL in single-layer Transformers, without positional encoding, does not possess the UAP; however, it is possible to achieve the UAP when positional encoding is included. Several sufficient conditions for the positional encoding are provided. Our findings reveal the benefits of positional encoding from an approximation theory perspective in the context of ICL.

Conclusion: 上下文引导的TTRL方法能有效提升测试时强化学习的性能和效率，特别是在设备端应用中具有实用价值。

Abstract: Test-time Reinforcement Learning (TTRL) has shown promise in adapting foundation models for complex tasks at test-time, resulting in large performance improvements. TTRL leverages an elegant two-phase sampling strategy: first, multi-sampling derives a pseudo-label via majority voting, while subsequent downsampling and reward-based fine-tuning encourages the model to explore and learn diverse valid solutions, with the pseudo-label modulating the reward signal. Meanwhile, in-context learning has been widely explored at inference time and demonstrated the ability to enhance model performance without weight updates. However, TTRL's two-phase sampling strategy under-utilizes contextual guidance, which can potentially improve pseudo-label accuracy in the initial exploitation phase while regulating exploration in the second. To address this, we propose context-guided TTRL (CG-TTRL), integrating context dynamically into both sampling phases and propose a method for efficient context selection for on-device applications. Our evaluations on mathematical and scientific QA benchmarks show CG-TTRL outperforms TTRL (e.g. additional 7% relative accuracy improvement over TTRL), while boosting efficiency by obtaining strong performance after only a few steps of test-time training (e.g. 8% relative improvement rather than 1% over TTRL after 3 steps).

TL;DR: 提出了C3E框架，通过信息论方法优化图神经网络的隐藏维度和传播深度选择，缓解过压缩问题，提升表示学习效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图神经网络通常依赖启发式选择隐藏维度和传播深度，导致传播过程中严重的信息丢失（过压缩问题）。

Method: 提出C3E框架，将隐藏维度和深度选择建模为基于信息论的非线性规划问题，将谱图神经网络建模为通信信道，连接信道容量与网络参数。

Result: 在9个公共数据集上的实验表明，C3E估计的参数能缓解过压缩并提升表示学习；发现过压缩源于表示矩阵中信息的累积压缩；增加隐藏维度确实能缓解信息压缩，而传播深度的作用更复杂。

Conclusion: 揭示了信息压缩与表示复杂性之间的基本平衡关系，为图神经网络参数选择提供了理论基础。

Abstract: Existing graph neural networks typically rely on heuristic choices for hidden dimensions and propagation depths, which often lead to severe information loss during propagation, known as over-squashing. To address this issue, we propose Channel Capacity Constrained Estimation (C3E), a novel framework that formulates the selection of hidden dimensions and depth as a nonlinear programming problem grounded in information theory. Through modeling spectral graph neural networks as communication channels, our approach directly connects channel capacity to hidden dimensions, propagation depth, propagation mechanism, and graph structure. Extensive experiments on nine public datasets demonstrate that hidden dimensions and depths estimated by C3E can mitigate over-squashing and consistently improve representation learning. Experimental results show that over-squashing occurs due to the cumulative compression of information in representation matrices. Furthermore, our findings show that increasing hidden dimensions indeed mitigate information compression, while the role of propagation depth is more nuanced, uncovering a fundamental balance between information compression and representation complexity.

Conclusion: FLEX标志着向可扩展和可继承的持续智能体进化迈出了重要一步。

Abstract: Autonomous agents driven by Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized reasoning and problem-solving but remain static after training, unable to grow with experience as intelligent beings do during deployment. We introduce Forward Learning with EXperience (FLEX), a gradient-free learning paradigm that enables LLM agents to continuously evolve through accumulated experience. Specifically, FLEX cultivates scalable and inheritable evolution by constructing a structured experience library through continual reflection on successes and failures during interaction with the environment. FLEX delivers substantial improvements on mathematical reasoning, chemical retrosynthesis, and protein fitness prediction (up to 23% on AIME25, 10% on USPTO50k, and 14% on ProteinGym). We further identify a clear scaling law of experiential growth and the phenomenon of experience inheritance across agents, marking a step toward scalable and inheritable continuous agent evolution.

TL;DR: ARBITER是一个风险中性的神经算子，用于在无套利约束下学习SPX-VIX联合期限结构。它通过约束解码器和外梯度更新来保证无套利条件，在历史数据上优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有模型难以同时保证SPX和VIX期限结构的无套利约束，需要开发能够学习联合期限结构并严格满足静态套利约束的神经算子。

Method: 结合算子学习与约束解码器，使用外梯度风格更新加投影，强制满足日历套利、垂直套利、蝶式套利、Lipschitz边界和单调性约束。

Result: 在历史SPX和VIX数据上优于傅里叶神经算子、DeepONet和状态空间序列模型，通过消融研究表明绑定SPX和VIX分支能减少对偶间隙并改善数值积分。

Conclusion: ARBITER提供了可识别的无套利插值和外推方法，Lipschitz投影稳定了校准过程，选择性状态更新改善了长期泛化能力。

Abstract: We propose ARBITER, a risk-neutral neural operator for learning joint SPX-VIX term structures under no-arbitrage constraints. ARBITER maps market states to an operator that outputs implied volatility and variance curves while enforcing static arbitrage (calendar, vertical, butterfly), Lipschitz bounds, and monotonicity. The model couples operator learning with constrained decoders and is trained with extragradient-style updates plus projection. We introduce evaluation metrics for derivatives term structures (NAS, CNAS, NI, Dual-Gap, Stability Rate) and show gains over Fourier Neural Operator, DeepONet, and state-space sequence models on historical SPX and VIX data. Ablation studies indicate that tying the SPX and VIX legs reduces Dual-Gap and improves NI, Lipschitz projection stabilizes calibration, and selective state updates improve long-horizon generalization. We provide identifiability and approximation results and describe practical recipes for arbitrage-free interpolation and extrapolation across maturities and strikes.

Abstract: Although multimodal fusion has made significant progress, its advancement is severely hindered by the lack of adequate evaluation benchmarks. Current fusion methods are typically evaluated on a small selection of public datasets, a limited scope that inadequately represents the complexity and diversity of real-world scenarios, potentially leading to biased evaluations. This issue presents a twofold challenge. On one hand, models may overfit to the biases of specific datasets, hindering their generalization to broader practical applications. On the other hand, the absence of a unified evaluation standard makes fair and objective comparisons between different fusion methods difficult. Consequently, a truly universal and high-performance fusion model has yet to emerge. To address these challenges, we have developed a large-scale, domain-adaptive benchmark for multimodal evaluation. This benchmark integrates over 30 datasets, encompassing 15 modalities and 20 predictive tasks across key application domains. To complement this, we have also developed an open-source, unified, and automated evaluation pipeline that includes standardized implementations of state-of-the-art models and diverse fusion paradigms. Leveraging this platform, we have conducted large-scale experiments, successfully establishing new performance baselines across multiple tasks. This work provides the academic community with a crucial platform for rigorous and reproducible assessment of multimodal models, aiming to propel the field of multimodal artificial intelligence to new heights.

Conclusion: 该研究为近似距离查询下的重构问题提供了理论框架，揭示了最优误差的几何本质和不同空间类型的渐近行为差异。

Abstract: Consider the task of locating an unknown target point using approximate distance queries: in each round, a reconstructor selects a query point and receives a noisy version of its distance to the target. This problem arises naturally in various contexts ranging from localization in GPS and sensor networks to privacy-aware data access, and spans a wide variety of metric spaces. It is relevant from the perspective of both the reconstructor (seeking accurate recovery) and the responder (aiming to limit information disclosure, e.g., for privacy or security reasons). We study this reconstruction game through a learning-theoretic lens, focusing on the rate and limits of the best possible reconstruction error. Our first result provides a tight geometric characterization of the optimal error in terms of the Chebyshev radius, a classical concept from geometry. This characterization applies to all compact metric spaces (in fact, even to all totally bounded spaces) and yields explicit formulas for natural metric spaces. Our second result addresses the asymptotic behavior of reconstruction, distinguishing between pseudo-finite spaces -- where the optimal error is attained after finitely many queries -- and spaces where the approximation curve exhibits nontrivial decay. We characterize pseudo-finiteness for convex Euclidean spaces.

Conclusion: NDDV方法在理论上具有稳定性保证，能够实现次线性收敛，为数据估值提供了可靠的理论基础。

Abstract: Data valuation quantifies data importance, but existing methods cannot ensure validity in a single training process. The neural dynamic data valuation (NDDV) method [3] addresses this limitation. Based on NDDV, we are the first to explore error estimation and convergence analysis in data valuation. Under Lipschitz and smoothness assumptions, we derive quadratic error bounds for loss differences that scale inversely with time steps and quadratically with control variations, ensuring stability. We also prove that the expected squared gradient norm for the training loss vanishes asymptotically, and that the meta loss converges sublinearly over iterations. In particular, NDDV achieves sublinear convergence.

Conclusion: 基于投影器分裂积分器的DyKAF方法能够有效提升Fisher矩阵近似质量，并在实际应用中表现出优越性能。

Abstract: Recently, optimizers that explicitly treat weights as matrices, rather than flattened vectors, have demonstrated their effectiveness. This perspective naturally leads to structured approximations of the Fisher matrix as preconditioners, where the matrix view induces a Kronecker-factorized form that enables memory-efficient representation. However, constructing such approximations both efficiently and accurately remains an open challenge, since obtaining the optimal factorization is resource-intensive and practical methods therefore rely on heuristic design choices. In this work, we introduce a novel approach that leverages projector-splitting integrators to construct effective preconditioners. Our optimizer, DyKAF (Dynamical Kronecker Approximation of the Fisher Matrix), consistently improves the Fisher matrix approximation quality. Experiments on large language model pre-training and fine-tuning demonstrate that DyKAF outperforms existing optimizers across a range of evaluation metrics.

In this study, we present an interpretable AI approach for sepsis analysis that integrates machine learning with clinical knowledge. Our method not only delivers accurate predictions of sepsis onset but also enables clinicians to understand, validate, and align model outputs with established medical expertise.

Conclusion: 基于Koopman自编码器的框架为处理时变图数据提供了一种有效方法，能够通过学习潜在空间中的非线性动态系统来实现图演化的预测和缺失数据重建。

Abstract: A wide variety of real-world data, such as sea measurements, e.g., temperatures collected by distributed sensors and multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) trajectories, can be naturally represented as graphs, often exhibiting non-Euclidean structures. These graph representations may evolve over time, forming time-varying graphs. Effectively modeling and analyzing such dynamic graph data is critical for tasks like predicting graph evolution and reconstructing missing graph data. In this paper, we propose a framework based on the Koopman autoencoder (KAE) to handle time-varying graph data. Specifically, we assume the existence of a hidden non-linear dynamical system, where the state vector corresponds to the graph embedding of the time-varying graph signals. To capture the evolving graph structures, the graph data is first converted into a vector time series through graph embedding, representing the structural information in a finite-dimensional latent space. In this latent space, the KAE is applied to learn the underlying non-linear dynamics governing the temporal evolution of graph features, enabling both prediction and reconstruction tasks.

TL;DR: SeqTopK是一种序列级专家路由方法，通过将专家预算从token级转移到序列级，实现动态分配：困难token分配更多专家，简单token分配更少专家，同时保持总预算不变。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准TopK路由为所有token分配固定数量的专家，忽略了token复杂度的差异。现有自适应路由方法需要额外模块和超参数，且通常需要从头重新训练。

Method: SeqTopK选择序列中所有token的前T·K个专家，实现端到端学习的动态分配。该方法只需几行代码，增加不到1%的开销，且与预训练MoE模型完全兼容。

Result: 在数学、编程、法律和写作等领域的实验显示，SeqTopK相比TopK和现有参数无关自适应方法有持续改进，在更高稀疏度下增益更大（最高达16.9%）。

Conclusion: SeqTopK是一种简单、高效且可扩展的路由策略，特别适合下一代LLM的极端稀疏机制。

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures scale large language models (LLMs) by activating only a subset of experts per token, but the standard TopK routing assigns the same fixed number of experts to all tokens, ignoring their varying complexity. Prior adaptive routing methods introduce additional modules and hyperparameters, often requiring costly retraining from scratch. We propose Sequence-level TopK (SeqTopK), a minimal modification that shifts the expert budget from the token level to the sequence level. By selecting the top $T \cdot K$ experts across all $T$ tokens, SeqTopK enables end-to-end learned dynamic allocation -- assigning more experts to difficult tokens and fewer to easy ones -- while preserving the same overall budget. SeqTopK requires only a few lines of code, adds less than 1% overhead, and remains fully compatible with pretrained MoE models. Experiments across math, coding, law, and writing show consistent improvements over TopK and prior parameter-free adaptive methods, with gains that become substantially larger under higher sparsity (up to 16.9%). These results highlight SeqTopK as a simple, efficient, and scalable routing strategy, particularly well-suited for the extreme sparsity regimes of next-generation LLMs. Code is available at https://github.com/Y-Research-SBU/SeqTopK.

Method: 采样ε-net并调用局部鲁棒性预言机，所需样本大小与输入维度、类别数量和学习算法无关。

Result: 实验证实该方法比最先进的采样方法更好地表征鲁棒性，且比形式化方法具有更好的可扩展性。

Conclusion: 该方法能够应用于超出传统形式化验证范围的大型神经网络，提供高效的概率鲁棒性保证。

Abstract: We propose and investigate probabilistic guarantees for the adversarial robustness of classification algorithms. While traditional formal verification approaches for robustness are intractable and sampling-based approaches do not provide formal guarantees, our approach is able to efficiently certify a probabilistic relaxation of robustness. The key idea is to sample an $ε$-net and invoke a local robustness oracle on the sample. Remarkably, the size of the sample needed to achieve probably approximately global robustness guarantees is independent of the input dimensionality, the number of classes, and the learning algorithm itself. Our approach can, therefore, be applied even to large neural networks that are beyond the scope of traditional formal verification. Experiments empirically confirm that it characterizes robustness better than state-of-the-art sampling-based approaches and scales better than formal methods.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了Tensor Head Averaging (THA)算法，通过构建在输入空间小子集上训练的局部MVMALS模型集合，显著降低了高维非线性动力系统识别的计算复杂度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统Tensor Network方法如MVMALS虽然通过利用Volterra核的低秩结构提供了可行方法，但仍面临计算和内存瓶颈，因为其复杂度随输入维度呈高阶多项式增长。

Method: THA算法构建局部MVMALS模型的集成，每个模型只在小输入子集上训练。通过理论分析建立了THA集成与完整MVMALS模型之间的误差界限，并推导了平方误差的精确分解。

Result: 证明了包含动态和省略动态之间的相关性会产生优化激励，使THA性能优于简单截断完整MVMALS模型。

Conclusion: THA为识别先前难以处理的高维系统提供了一种可扩展且理论上有依据的方法。

Abstract: The identification of high-dimensional nonlinear dynamical systems via the Volterra series has significant potential, but has been severely hindered by the curse of dimensionality. Tensor Network (TN) methods such as the Modified Alternating Linear Scheme (MVMALS) have been a breakthrough for the field, offering a tractable approach by exploiting the low-rank structure in Volterra kernels. However, these techniques still encounter prohibitive computational and memory bottlenecks due to high-order polynomial scaling with respect to input dimension. To overcome this barrier, we introduce the Tensor Head Averaging (THA) algorithm, which significantly reduces complexity by constructing an ensemble of localized MVMALS models trained on small subsets of the input space. In this paper, we present a theoretical foundation for the THA algorithm. We establish observable, finite-sample bounds on the error between the THA ensemble and a full MVMALS model, and we derive an exact decomposition of the squared error. This decomposition is used to analyze the manner in which subset models implicitly compensate for omitted dynamics. We quantify this effect, and prove that correlation between the included and omitted dynamics creates an optimization incentive which drives THA's performance toward accuracy superior to a simple truncation of a full MVMALS model. THA thus offers a scalable and theoretically grounded approach for identifying previously intractable high-dimensional systems.

Conclusion: 提出的TriShGAN方法通过三元组损失和Shapelet提取器，有效解决了多元时间序列反事实解释生成中的鲁棒性和效率问题，为决策支持提供了更可靠的解释工具。

Abstract: In decision-making processes, stakeholders often rely on counterfactual explanations, which provide suggestions about what should be changed in the queried instance to alter the outcome of an AI system. However, generating these explanations for multivariate time series presents challenges due to their complex, multi-dimensional nature. Traditional Nearest Unlike Neighbor-based methods typically substitute subsequences in a queried time series with influential subsequences from an NUN, which is not always realistic in real-world scenarios due to the rigid direct substitution. Counterfactual with Residual Generative Adversarial Networks-based methods aim to address this by learning from the distribution of observed data to generate synthetic counterfactual explanations. However, these methods primarily focus on minimizing the cost from the queried time series to the counterfactual explanations and often neglect the importance of distancing the counterfactual explanation from the decision boundary. This oversight can result in explanations that no longer qualify as counterfactual if minor changes occur within the model. To generate a more robust counterfactual explanation, we introduce TriShGAN, under the CounteRGAN framework enhanced by the incorporation of triplet loss. This unsupervised learning approach uses distance metric learning to encourage the counterfactual explanations not only to remain close to the queried time series but also to capture the feature distribution of the instance with the desired outcome, thereby achieving a better balance between minimal cost and robustness. Additionally, we integrate a Shapelet Extractor that strategically selects the most discriminative parts of the high-dimensional queried time series to enhance the sparsity of counterfactual explanation and efficiency of the training process.

Motivation: 电动汽车功率估计需要同时保证点估计精度和可信的不确定性，以支持续航预测和能源管理决策。

Method: 使用锚定集成LSTM结合Student-t似然函数，通过高斯权重先验实现后验多样性，无需测试时采样，t分布头提供重尾鲁棒性和闭式预测区间。

Conclusion: 该方法在精度、校准和系统效率之间取得平衡，为电动汽车能源管理提供可靠的续航估计和决策支持。

Abstract: Accurate EV power estimation underpins range prediction and energy management, yet practitioners need both point accuracy and trustworthy uncertainty. We propose an anchored-ensemble Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) with a Student-t likelihood that jointly captures epistemic (model) and aleatoric (data) uncertainty. Anchoring imposes a Gaussian weight prior (MAP training), yielding posterior-like diversity without test-time sampling, while the t-head provides heavy-tailed robustness and closed-form prediction intervals. Using vehicle-kinematic time series (e.g., speed, motor RPM), our model attains strong accuracy: RMSE 3.36 +/- 1.10, MAE 2.21 +/- 0.89, R-squared = 0.93 +/- 0.02, explained variance 0.93 +/- 0.02, and delivers well-calibrated uncertainty bands with near-nominal coverage. Against competitive baselines (Student-t MC dropout; quantile regression with/without anchoring), our method matches or improves log-scores while producing sharper intervals at the same coverage. Crucially for real-time deployment, inference is a single deterministic pass per ensemble member (or a weight-averaged collapse), eliminating Monte Carlo latency. The result is a compact, theoretically grounded estimator that couples accuracy, calibration, and systems efficiency, enabling reliable range estimation and decision-making for production EV energy management.

Abstract: Adopting artificial intelligence (AI) in radio access networks (RANs) presents several challenges, including limited availability of link-level measurements (e.g., CQI reports), stringent real-time processing constraints (e.g., sub-1 ms per TTI), and network heterogeneity (different spectrum bands, cell types, and vendor equipment). A critical yet often overlooked barrier lies in the computational and memory limitations of RAN baseband hardware, particularly in legacy 4th Generation (4G) systems, which typically lack on-chip neural accelerators. As a result, only lightweight AI models (under 1 Mb and sub-100~μs inference time) can be effectively deployed, limiting both their performance and applicability. However, achieving strong generalization across diverse network conditions often requires large-scale models with substantial resource demands. To address this trade-off, this paper investigates policy distillation in the context of a reinforcement learning-based link adaptation task. We explore two strategies: single-policy distillation, where a scenario-agnostic teacher model is compressed into one generalized student model; and multi-policy distillation, where multiple scenario-specific teachers are consolidated into a single generalist student. Experimental evaluations in a high-fidelity, 5th Generation (5G)-compliant simulator demonstrate that both strategies produce compact student models that preserve the teachers' generalization capabilities while complying with the computational and memory limitations of existing RAN hardware.

Conclusion: 现有公平性评估存在局限性，需要更全面的框架来检测系统性偏见，提出的方法能有效改善公平性表现。

Abstract: Link prediction is a fundamental task in graph machine learning with applications, ranging from social recommendation to knowledge graph completion. Fairness in this setting is critical, as biased predictions can exacerbate societal inequalities. Prior work adopts a dyadic definition of fairness, enforcing fairness through demographic parity between intra-group and inter-group link predictions. However, we show that this dyadic framing can obscure underlying disparities across subgroups, allowing systemic biases to go undetected. Moreover, we argue that demographic parity does not meet desired properties for fairness assessment in ranking-based tasks such as link prediction. We formalize the limitations of existing fairness evaluations and propose a framework that enables a more expressive assessment. Additionally, we propose a lightweight post-processing method combined with decoupled link predictors that effectively mitigates bias and achieves state-of-the-art fairness-utility trade-offs.

Abstract: In this work, we study offline convex optimization with smooth objectives, where the classical Nesterov's Accelerated Gradient (NAG) method achieves the optimal accelerated convergence. Extensive research has aimed to understand NAG from various perspectives, and a recent line of work approaches this from the viewpoint of online learning and online-to-batch conversion, emphasizing the role of optimistic online algorithms for acceleration. In this work, we contribute to this perspective by proposing novel optimistic online-to-batch conversions that incorporate optimism theoretically into the analysis, thereby significantly simplifying the online algorithm design while preserving the optimal convergence rates. Specifically, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our conversions through the following results: (i) when combined with simple online gradient descent, our optimistic conversion achieves the optimal accelerated convergence; (ii) our conversion also applies to strongly convex objectives, and by leveraging both optimistic online-to-batch conversion and optimistic online algorithms, we achieve the optimal accelerated convergence rate for strongly convex and smooth objectives, for the first time through the lens of online-to-batch conversion; (iii) our optimistic conversion can achieve universality to smoothness -- applicable to both smooth and non-smooth objectives without requiring knowledge of the smoothness coefficient -- and remains efficient as non-universal methods by using only one gradient query in each iteration. Finally, we highlight the effectiveness of our optimistic online-to-batch conversions by a precise correspondence with NAG.

Abstract: Message passing is the core operation in graph neural networks, where each node updates its embeddings by aggregating information from its neighbors. However, in deep architectures, this process often leads to diminished expressiveness. A popular solution is to use residual connections, where the input from the current (or initial) layer is added to aggregated neighbor information to preserve embeddings across layers. Following a recent line of research, we investigate an adaptive residual scheme in which different nodes have varying residual strengths. We prove that this approach prevents oversmoothing; particularly, we show that the Dirichlet energy of the embeddings remains bounded away from zero. This is the first theoretical guarantee not only for the adaptive setting, but also for static residual connections (where residual strengths are shared across nodes) with activation functions. Furthermore, extensive experiments show that this adaptive approach outperforms standard and state-of-the-art message passing mechanisms, especially on heterophilic graphs. To improve the time complexity of our approach, we introduce a variant in which residual strengths are not learned but instead set heuristically, a choice that performs as well as the learnable version.

Abstract: Lost circulation remains a major and costly challenge in drilling operations, often resulting in wellbore instability, stuck pipe, and extended non-productive time. Accurate prediction of fluid loss is therefore essential for improving drilling safety and efficiency. This study presents a probabilistic machine learning framework based on Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) for predicting drilling fluid loss in complex formations. The GPR model captures nonlinear dependencies among drilling parameters while quantifying predictive uncertainty, offering enhanced reliability for high-risk decision-making. Model hyperparameters are optimized using the Limited memory Broyden Fletcher Goldfarb Shanno (LBFGS) algorithm to ensure numerical stability and robust generalization. To improve interpretability, Local Interpretable Model agnostic Explanations (LIME) are employed to elucidate how individual features influence model predictions. The results highlight the potential of explainable probabilistic learning for proactive identification of lost-circulation risks, optimized design of lost circulation materials (LCM), and reduction of operational uncertainties in drilling applications.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved significant success in addressing node classification tasks. However, the effectiveness of traditional GNNs degrades on heterophilic graphs, where connected nodes often belong to different labels or properties. While recent work has introduced mechanisms to improve GNN performance under heterophily, certain key limitations still exist. Most existing models apply a fixed aggregation depth across all nodes, overlooking the fact that nodes may require different propagation depths based on their local homophily levels and neighborhood structures. Moreover, many methods are tailored to either homophilic or heterophilic settings, lacking the flexibility to generalize across both regimes. To address these challenges, we develop a theoretical framework that links local structural and label characteristics to information propagation dynamics at the node level. Our analysis shows that optimal aggregation depth varies across nodes and is critical for preserving class-discriminative information. Guided by this insight, we propose a novel adaptive-depth GNN architecture that dynamically selects node-specific aggregation depths using theoretically grounded metrics. Our method seamlessly adapts to both homophilic and heterophilic patterns within a unified model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach consistently enhances the performance of standard GNN backbones across diverse benchmarks.

Abstract: Accurate forecasting of complex high-dimensional dynamical systems from observational data is essential for several applications across science and engineering. A key challenge, however, is that real-world measurements are often corrupted by noise, which severely degrades the performance of data-driven models. Particularly, in chaotic dynamical systems, where small errors amplify rapidly, it is challenging to identify a data-driven model from noisy data that achieves short-term accuracy while preserving long-term invariant properties. In this paper, we propose the use of the weak formulation as a complementary approach to the classical strong formulation of data-driven time-series forecasting models. Specifically, we focus on the neural ordinary differential equation (NODE) architecture. Unlike the standard strong formulation, which relies on the discretization of the NODE followed by optimization, the weak formulation constrains the model using a set of integrated residuals over temporal subdomains. While such a formulation yields an effective NODE model, we discover that the performance of a NODE can be further enhanced by employing this weak formulation as a penalty alongside the classical strong formulation-based learning. Through numerical demonstrations, we illustrate that our proposed training strategy, which we coined as the Weak-Penalty NODE (WP-NODE), achieves state-of-the-art forecasting accuracy and exceptional robustness across benchmark chaotic dynamical systems.

Result: EnFo展现出显著的样本效率，仅用原始数据的一小部分就能匹配其性能，同时提供强大的隐私保护和抗滥用能力。

Conclusion: EnFo为企业提供了在不损害核心分析优势的情况下进行战略合作的实用解决方案。

Abstract: The non-rival nature of data creates a dilemma for firms: sharing data unlocks value but risks eroding competitive advantage. Existing data synthesis methods often exacerbate this problem by creating data with symmetric utility, allowing any party to extract its value. This paper introduces the Encapsulation-Forging (EnFo) framework, a novel approach to generate rival synthetic data with asymmetric utility. EnFo operates in two stages: it first encapsulates predictive knowledge from the original data into a designated ``key'' model, and then forges a synthetic dataset by optimizing the data to intentionally overfit this key model. This process transforms non-rival data into a rival product, ensuring its value is accessible only to the intended model, thereby preventing unauthorized use and preserving the data owner's competitive edge. Our framework demonstrates remarkable sample efficiency, matching the original data's performance with a fraction of its size, while providing robust privacy protection and resistance to misuse. EnFo offers a practical solution for firms to collaborate strategically without compromising their core analytical advantage.

Conclusion: DST框架通过双分支时空自监督学习有效解决了道路网络表示学习中的空间异质性和时间动态性问题，在多种任务中表现优异，特别是在零样本学习场景中具有显著优势。

Abstract: Road network representation learning (RNRL) has attracted increasing attention from both researchers and practitioners as various spatiotemporal tasks are emerging. Recent advanced methods leverage Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and contrastive learning to characterize the spatial structure of road segments in a self-supervised paradigm. However, spatial heterogeneity and temporal dynamics of road networks raise severe challenges to the neighborhood smoothing mechanism of self-supervised GNNs. To address these issues, we propose a $\textbf{D}$ual-branch $\textbf{S}$patial-$\textbf{T}$emporal self-supervised representation framework for enhanced road representations, termed as DST. On one hand, DST designs a mix-hop transition matrix for graph convolution to incorporate dynamic relations of roads from trajectories. Besides, DST contrasts road representations of the vanilla road network against that of the hypergraph in a spatial self-supervised way. The hypergraph is newly built based on three types of hyperedges to capture long-range relations. On the other hand, DST performs next token prediction as the temporal self-supervised task on the sequences of traffic dynamics based on a causal Transformer, which is further regularized by differentiating traffic modes of weekdays from those of weekends. Extensive experiments against state-of-the-art methods verify the superiority of our proposed framework. Moreover, the comprehensive spatiotemporal modeling facilitates DST to excel in zero-shot learning scenarios.

### [130] [CaberNet: Causal Representation Learning for Cross-Domain HVAC Energy Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06634)
*Kaiyuan Zhai,Jiacheng Cui,Zhehao Zhang,Junyu Xue,Yang Deng,Kui Wu,Guoming Tang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CaberNet是一个因果可解释的深度序列模型，通过学习不变表示来解决跨域HVAC能耗预测问题，在无需先验知识的情况下显著提升预测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 跨域HVAC能耗预测对可扩展的建筑能源管理至关重要，但为每个新建筑收集大量标注数据成本高昂且不切实际。现有方法面临数据稀缺性、异质性以及不同气候区域带来的变异性问题，容易过拟合伪相关或依赖专家干预。

Method: CaberNet整合了：1）通过自监督伯努利正则化训练的全局特征门，区分优质因果特征；2）域平衡训练方案，平衡域贡献、最小化跨域损失方差并促进潜在因子独立性。

Result: 在三个气候多样化城市的三座真实建筑数据集上评估，CaberNet始终优于所有基线方法，相比最佳基准实现了22.9%的归一化均方误差降低。

Conclusion: CaberNet提供了一种纯数据驱动的方法，无需先验知识即可实现稳健的跨域HVAC能耗预测，显著提升了预测性能。

Abstract: Cross-domain HVAC energy prediction is essential for scalable building energy management, particularly because collecting extensive labeled data for every new building is both costly and impractical. Yet, this task remains highly challenging due to the scarcity and heterogeneity of data across different buildings, climate zones, and seasonal patterns. In particular, buildings situated in distinct climatic regions introduce variability that often leads existing methods to overfit to spurious correlations, rely heavily on expert intervention, or compromise on data diversity. To address these limitations, we propose CaberNet, a causal and interpretable deep sequence model that learns invariant (Markov blanket) representations for robust cross-domain prediction. In a purely data-driven fashion and without requiring any prior knowledge, CaberNet integrates i) a global feature gate trained with a self-supervised Bernoulli regularization to distinguish superior causal features from inferior ones, and ii) a domain-wise training scheme that balances domain contributions, minimizes cross-domain loss variance, and promotes latent factor independence. We evaluate CaberNet on real-world datasets collected from three buildings located in three climatically diverse cities, and it consistently outperforms all baselines, achieving a 22.9\% reduction in normalized mean squared error (NMSE) compared to the best benchmark.

*Mohammadreza M. Kalan,Yuyang Deng,Eitan J. Neugut,Samory Kpotufe*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于Neyman-Pearson分类中迁移学习的自适应方法，能够同时控制两类错误，避免负迁移，并保证统计和计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统迁移学习主要关注标准分类问题，但在不平衡分类（如Neyman-Pearson分类）中研究较少。现有方法只处理μ₁分布的偏移，而实际场景中μ₀和μ₁都可能发生偏移，需要同时控制两类错误。

Method: 开发了一种自适应程序，当源数据有信息量时能改善两类错误，当源数据无信息量时能自动适应，避免负迁移。

Result: 该方法不仅提供了统计保证（改进的Type-I和Type-II错误），还展示了计算效率保证。

Conclusion: 提出的自适应方法解决了Neyman-Pearson分类中迁移学习的挑战，能够处理双分布偏移，同时保证统计性能和计算效率。

Abstract: We consider the problem of transfer learning in Neyman-Pearson classification, where the objective is to minimize the error w.r.t. a distribution $μ_1$, subject to the constraint that the error w.r.t. a distribution $μ_0$ remains below a prescribed threshold. While transfer learning has been extensively studied in traditional classification, transfer learning in imbalanced classification such as Neyman-Pearson classification has received much less attention. This setting poses unique challenges, as both types of errors must be simultaneously controlled. Existing works address only the case of distribution shift in $μ_1$, whereas in many practical scenarios shifts may occur in both $μ_0$ and $μ_1$. We derive an adaptive procedure that not only guarantees improved Type-I and Type-II errors when the source is informative, but also automatically adapt to situations where the source is uninformative, thereby avoiding negative transfer. In addition to such statistical guarantees, the procedures is efficient, as shown via complementary computational guarantees.

*Renato Castro,Rodrigo Paredes,Douglas Kahn*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个机器学习框架，用于预测哪些饮料客户在获得冷藏设备后最有可能实现销量增长，从而优化资产分配决策。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在快速消费品行业，物理资产（如商用饮料冷藏设备）的放置位置直接影响收入增长和执行效率。虽然客户流失预测和需求预测在B2B环境中已被广泛研究，但使用机器学习指导资产分配仍相对未被探索。

Method: 使用来自中美洲知名酿造和饮料公司的3,119个B2B传统贸易渠道客户的私有数据集，跟踪冷藏设备安装前后12个月的销售交易。定义了10%、30%和50%三个销量同比增长阈值。比较了XGBoost、LightGBM和CatBoost等机器学习模型，并结合SHAP进行可解释的特征分析。

Result: 最佳模型在验证集上的AUC得分分别为0.857、0.877和0.898（对应三个增长阈值）。模拟表明，与传统基于销量的方法相比，该方法能更好地选择有增长潜力的客户，并通过不分配给不会增长的客户来增加成本节约。

Conclusion: 该框架能够提高投资回报率，并为与冷藏设备分配相关的业务运营改进提供重要见解。

Abstract: In the fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) industry, deciding where to place physical assets, such as commercial beverage coolers, can directly impact revenue growth and execution efficiency. Although churn prediction and demand forecasting have been widely studied in B2B contexts, the use of machine learning to guide asset allocation remains relatively unexplored. This paper presents a framework focused on predicting which beverage clients are most likely to deliver strong returns in volume after receiving a cooler. Using a private dataset from a well-known Central American brewing and beverage company of 3,119 B2B traditional trade channel clients that received a cooler from 2022-01 to 2024-07, and tracking 12 months of sales transactions before and after cooler installation, three growth thresholds were defined: 10%, 30% and 50% growth in sales volume year over year. The analysis compares results of machine learning models such as XGBoost, LightGBM, and CatBoost combined with SHAP for interpretable feature analysis in order to have insights into improving business operations related to cooler allocation; the results show that the best model has AUC scores of 0.857, 0.877, and 0.898 across the thresholds on the validation set. Simulations suggest that this approach can improve ROI because it better selects potential clients to grow at the expected level and increases cost savings by not assigning clients that will not grow, compared to traditional volume-based approaches with substantial business management recommendations

TL;DR: 提出了首个结合知识图谱和电子健康记录的系统，通过教师-学生模型实现零样本药物相互作用预测，能够在未见药物上产生可解释的机制特异性警报。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有药物相互作用预测模型存在局限性：基于知识图谱的方法无法处理未见药物，基于电子健康记录的方法存在噪声、时间依赖性和站点依赖性问题。需要开发能够结合两者优势并实现零样本推理的系统。

Method: 使用融合教师模型学习药物对在两种数据源中的机制特异性关系，然后蒸馏为仅使用电子健康记录的学生模型。采用共享药理学机制本体，在推理时无需访问知识图谱。

Result: 在多机构测试数据上保持精度，产生机制特异性、临床一致的预测，在可比总体检测性能下减少误报，漏报更少的真实相互作用。零样本识别了知识图谱中缺失药物的CYP介导和药效学机制。

Conclusion: 该系统支持临床决策支持和药物警戒的实际应用，能够为未见药物产生可解释的机制特异性警报，优于现有方法。

Abstract: Drug-drug interactions (DDIs) remain a major source of preventable harm, and many clinically important mechanisms are still unknown. Existing models either rely on pharmacologic knowledge graphs (KGs), which fail on unseen drugs, or on electronic health records (EHRs), which are noisy, temporal, and site-dependent. We introduce, to our knowledge, the first system that conditions KG relation scoring on patient-level EHR context and distills that reasoning into an EHR-only model for zero-shot inference. A fusion "Teacher" learns mechanism-specific relations for drug pairs represented in both sources, while a distilled "Student" generalizes to new or rarely used drugs without KG access at inference. Both operate under a shared ontology (set) of pharmacologic mechanisms (drug relations) to produce interpretable, auditable alerts rather than opaque risk scores. Trained on a multi-institution EHR corpus paired with a curated DrugBank DDI graph, and evaluated using a clinically aligned, decision-focused protocol with leakage-safe negatives that avoid artificially easy pairs, the system maintains precision across multi-institutuion test data, produces mechanism-specific, clinically consistent predictions, reduces false alerts (higher precision) at comparable overall detection performance (F1), and misses fewer true interactions compared to prior methods. Case studies further show zero-shot identification of clinically recognized CYP-mediated and pharmacodynamic mechanisms for drugs absent from the KG, supporting real-world use in clinical decision support and pharmacovigilance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决阿尔茨海默病预测中的成本-准确性困境，常规认知测试和临床数据预测能力不足，而PET扫描和CSF生物标志物分析成本过高。

Method: 设计两阶段机器学习框架，基于预测的"信息价值"选择性获取昂贵的先进特征，应用于ADNI数据集预测MCI向AD的转化。

Result: 框架将高级检测需求减少20%，测试AUROC达到0.929，与使用所有特征的模型性能相当（AUROC=0.915，p=0.1010），并提供可解释性分析。

Conclusion: 该框架优化了AD诊断路径，平衡了准确性和成本，为实现早期可靠AD预测提供了可行方案，未来应考虑更多类别的高级特征和大规模验证。

Abstract: Accurate predictions of conversion from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to Alzheimer's disease (AD) can enable effective personalized therapy. While cognitive tests and clinical data are routinely collected, they lack the predictive power of PET scans and CSF biomarker analysis, which are prohibitively expensive to obtain for every patient. To address this cost-accuracy dilemma, we design a two-stage machine learning framework that selectively obtains advanced, costly features based on their predicted "value of information". We apply our framework to predict AD progression for MCI patients using data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). Our framework reduces the need for advanced testing by 20% while achieving a test AUROC of 0.929, comparable to the model that uses both basic and advanced features (AUROC=0.915, p=0.1010). We also provide an example interpretability analysis showing how one may explain the triage decision. Our work presents an interpretable, data-driven framework that optimizes AD diagnostic pathways and balances accuracy with cost, representing a step towards making early, reliable AD prediction more accessible in real-world practice. Future work should consider multiple categories of advanced features and larger-scale validation.

Motivation: 多模态学习通常期望优于单模态学习，但实际中由于模态间学习不平衡，有时甚至表现不如单模态方法。现有方法使用启发式策略解决不平衡问题，但往往计算密集。

Method: 将多模态学习问题重新表述为多目标优化问题，并提出基于梯度的算法来解决修改后的多模态学习问题。

Conclusion: 该方法通过多目标优化框架有效解决了多模态学习中的不平衡问题，在提升性能的同时显著降低了计算成本。

Abstract: Multi-modal learning (MML) aims to integrate information from multiple modalities, which is expected to lead to superior performance over single-modality learning. However, recent studies have shown that MML can underperform, even compared to single-modality approaches, due to imbalanced learning across modalities. Methods have been proposed to alleviate this imbalance issue using different heuristics, which often lead to computationally intensive subroutines. In this paper, we reformulate the MML problem as a multi-objective optimization (MOO) problem that overcomes the imbalanced learning issue among modalities and propose a gradient-based algorithm to solve the modified MML problem. We provide convergence guarantees for the proposed method, and empirical evaluations on popular MML benchmarks showcasing the improved performance of the proposed method over existing balanced MML and MOO baselines, with up to ~20x reduction in subroutine computation time.

TL;DR: CLaP是一个通过逐层分离因果信号与上下文来提升分子性质预测准确性和可解释性的框架，它整合多种分子图表示并生成原子级因果显著性图。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度模型用于分子性质预测时难以解释，且可能依赖虚假上下文而非因果结构，导致在分布偏移下可靠性降低和预测性能下降。

Method: 在每一层，因果块将特征软分割为因果和非因果分支，跨模态融合因果证据，逐步移除批次耦合的上下文以关注标签相关结构，限制捷径信号并稳定逐层优化。

Result: 在四个分子基准测试中，CLaP在MAE、MSE和R²指标上持续优于竞争基线方法。

Conclusion: 通过逐层剥离上下文与因果关系，该模型产生了既准确又可解释的分子设计预测器，并提供用于靶向分子编辑的可操作指导。

Abstract: Deep models are used for molecular property prediction, yet they are often difficult to interpret and may rely on spurious context rather than causal structure, which reduces reliability under distribution shift and harms predictive performance. We introduce CLaP (Causal Layerwise Peeling), a framework that separates causal signal from context in a layerwise manner and integrates diverse graph representations of molecules. At each layer, a causal block performs a soft split into causal and non-causal branches, fuses causal evidence across modalities, and progressively removes batch-coupled context to focus on label-relevant structure, thereby limiting shortcut signals and stabilizing layerwise refinement. Across four molecular benchmarks, CLaP consistently improves MAE, MSE, and $R^2$ over competitive baselines. The model also produces atom-level causal saliency maps that highlight substructures responsible for predictions, providing actionable guidance for targeted molecular edits. Case studies confirm the accuracy of these maps and their alignment with chemical intuition. By peeling context from cause at every layer, the model yields predictors that are both accurate and interpretable for molecular design.

Motivation: 机器学习推理规模巨大，但其环境影响，特别是在低资源硬件上的影响，仍然缺乏量化。需要工具来测量和评估推理过程的环境成本。

Method: 开发了ML-EcoLyzer工具，支持经典和现代模型，应用自适应监测和硬件感知评估。评估了超过1,900种推理配置，涵盖不同模型架构、任务模态、硬件类型和精度级别。

Result: 量化结果显示：量化技术可提高ESS，大型加速器在轻量级应用中可能效率低下，即使小型模型在实现不当时也可能产生显著成本。

Conclusion: ML-EcoLyzer为可持续性意识模型选择设定了标准，并提供了推理过程中环境成本的广泛实证评估。

Abstract: Machine learning inference occurs at a massive scale, yet its environmental impact remains poorly quantified, especially on low-resource hardware. We present ML-EcoLyzer, a cross-framework tool for measuring the carbon, energy, thermal, and water costs of inference across CPUs, consumer GPUs, and datacenter accelerators. The tool supports both classical and modern models, applying adaptive monitoring and hardware-aware evaluation.
  We introduce the Environmental Sustainability Score (ESS), which quantifies the number of effective parameters served per gram of CO$_2$ emitted. Our evaluation covers over 1,900 inference configurations, spanning diverse model architectures, task modalities (text, vision, audio, tabular), hardware types, and precision levels. These rigorous and reliable measurements demonstrate that quantization enhances ESS, huge accelerators can be inefficient for lightweight applications, and even small models may incur significant costs when implemented suboptimally. ML-EcoLyzer sets a standard for sustainability-conscious model selection and offers an extensive empirical evaluation of environmental costs during inference.

Motivation: 现有的等变图神经网络需要微调以适应新任务，但传统PEFT方法会破坏对称性，而ELoRA虽然保持等变性但自由度较高会干扰预训练特征分布

Result: 在多个基准测试中，MMEA持续改进能量和力预测至最先进水平，同时训练参数少于竞争方法

Conclusion: 在许多实际场景中，调制通道幅度足以使等变模型适应新化学环境而不破坏对称性，这为等变PEFT设计指明了新方向

Abstract: Pretrained equivariant graph neural networks based on spherical harmonics offer efficient and accurate alternatives to computationally expensive ab-initio methods, yet adapting them to new tasks and chemical environments still requires fine-tuning. Conventional parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) techniques, such as Adapters and LoRA, typically break symmetry, making them incompatible with those equivariant architectures. ELoRA, recently proposed, is the first equivariant PEFT method. It achieves improved parameter efficiency and performance on many benchmarks. However, the relatively high degrees of freedom it retains within each tensor order can still perturb pretrained feature distributions and ultimately degrade performance. To address this, we present Magnitude-Modulated Equivariant Adapter (MMEA), a novel equivariant fine-tuning method which employs lightweight scalar gating to modulate feature magnitudes on a per-order and per-multiplicity basis. We demonstrate that MMEA preserves strict equivariance and, across multiple benchmarks, consistently improves energy and force predictions to state-of-the-art levels while training fewer parameters than competing approaches. These results suggest that, in many practical scenarios, modulating channel magnitudes is sufficient to adapt equivariant models to new chemical environments without breaking symmetry, pointing toward a new paradigm for equivariant PEFT design.

Motivation: 现有设备端传感器校准研究仅关注三个宏观要求（精度、实时性、资源效率），但忽略了瞬时误差和最坏情况延迟等部署瓶颈。

Method: 1）序列透镜投影器对数压缩时间序列数据；2）高效位注意力模块用位运算替代乘法；3）哈希优化策略确保稳定训练。

Conclusion: SCARE是首个同时满足所有八个微观部署要求的传感器校准模型，显著提升了设备端部署的可行性。

Abstract: Most on-device sensor calibration studies benchmark models only against three macroscopic requirements (i.e., accuracy, real-time, and resource efficiency), thereby hiding deployment bottlenecks such as instantaneous error and worst-case latency. We therefore decompose this triad into eight microscopic requirements and introduce Scare (Sensor Calibration model balancing Accuracy, Real-time, and Efficiency), an ultra-compressed transformer that fulfills them all. SCARE comprises three core components: (1) Sequence Lens Projector (SLP) that logarithmically compresses time-series data while preserving boundary information across bins, (2) Efficient Bitwise Attention (EBA) module that replaces costly multiplications with bitwise operations via binary hash codes, and (3) Hash optimization strategy that ensures stable training without auxiliary loss terms. Together, these components minimize computational overhead while maintaining high accuracy and compatibility with microcontroller units (MCUs). Extensive experiments on large-scale air-quality datasets and real microcontroller deployments demonstrate that Scare outperforms existing linear, hybrid, and deep-learning baselines, making Scare, to the best of our knowledge, the first model to meet all eight microscopic requirements simultaneously.

Conclusion: 提出的多模态持续学习框架能有效整合多模态信息并防止灾难性遗忘，在多种增量学习场景下表现优异。

Abstract: Continual learning is essential for adapting models to new tasks while retaining previously acquired knowledge. While existing approaches predominantly focus on uni-modal data, multi-modal learning offers substantial benefits by utilizing diverse sensory inputs, akin to human perception. However, multi-modal continual learning presents additional challenges, as the model must effectively integrate new information from various modalities while preventing catastrophic forgetting. In this work, we propose a pre-trained model-based framework for multi-modal continual learning. Our framework includes a novel cross-modality adapter with a mixture-of-experts structure to facilitate effective integration of multi-modal information across tasks. We also introduce a representation alignment loss that fosters learning of robust multi-modal representations, and regularize relationships between learned representations to preserve knowledge from previous tasks. Experiments on several multi-modal datasets demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms baselines in both class-incremental and domain-incremental learning, achieving higher accuracy and reduced forgetting.

Method: 使用rank-1 LoRA为Qwen-2.5-32B-Instruct创建最小参数适配器，分析其激活模式，并在整个激活状态上训练稀疏自编码器识别细粒度特征。

Result: LoRA适配器恢复了73-90%的推理基准性能，其激活与MLP神经元一样可解释，且针对特定推理行为触发，识别出了细粒度和单义性特征。

Conclusion: 推理性能主要源于基础模型参数的微小改变，参数高效训练方法可作为揭示语言模型行为动态的有针对性工具。

Abstract: Reasoning models leverage inference-time compute to significantly enhance the performance of language models on difficult logical tasks, and have become a dominating paradigm in frontier LLMs. Despite their wide adoption, the mechanisms underpinning the enhanced performance of these reasoning models are not well understood. In this work, we show that the majority of new capabilities in reasoning models can be elicited by small, single-rank changes to base model parameters, with many of these changes being interpretable. Specifically, we use a rank-1 LoRA to create a minimal parameter adapter for Qwen-2.5-32B-Instruct which recovers 73-90% of reasoning-benchmark performance compared to a full parameter finetune. We find that the activations of this LoRA are as interpretable as MLP neurons, and fire for reasoning-specific behaviors. Finally, we train a sparse autoencoder on the entire activation state of this LoRA and identify fine-grained and monosemantic features. Our findings highlight that reasoning performance can arise largely from minimal changes to base model parameters, and explore what these changes affect. More broadly, our work shows that parameter-efficient training methods can be used as a targeted lens for uncovering fundamental insights about language model behavior and dynamics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法如残差连接和跳跃层未能显式建模节点表示在层间的节点特定渐进演化，且未考虑全局信息，无法有效解决过平滑问题。

Method: DMbaGCN包含两个模块：LSEMba用于局部邻域聚合，利用Mamba的选择性状态空间建模捕获节点特定表示动态；GCAMba利用Mamba的全局注意力能力为每个节点融入全局上下文。

Result: 在多个基准测试上的广泛实验证明了该方法的有效性和效率。

Conclusion: DMbaGCN通过结合局部状态演化和全局上下文感知，增强了深度GNN中节点的可区分性，从而缓解了过平滑问题。

Abstract: Over-smoothing remains a fundamental challenge in deep Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), where repeated message passing causes node representations to become indistinguishable. While existing solutions, such as residual connections and skip layers, alleviate this issue to some extent, they fail to explicitly model how node representations evolve in a node-specific and progressive manner across layers. Moreover, these methods do not take global information into account, which is also crucial for mitigating the over-smoothing problem. To address the aforementioned issues, in this work, we propose a Dual Mamba-enhanced Graph Convolutional Network (DMbaGCN), which is a novel framework that integrates Mamba into GNNs to address over-smoothing from both local and global perspectives. DMbaGCN consists of two modules: the Local State-Evolution Mamba (LSEMba) for local neighborhood aggregation and utilizing Mamba's selective state space modeling to capture node-specific representation dynamics across layers, and the Global Context-Aware Mamba (GCAMba) that leverages Mamba's global attention capabilities to incorporate global context for each node. By combining these components, DMbaGCN enhances node discriminability in deep GNNs, thereby mitigating over-smoothing. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our method.

TL;DR: 提出隐式联邦上下文学习框架IFed-ICL，通过将客户端本地上下文示例转换为隐式向量表示，在推理阶段实现分布式协作计算，避免传统微调方法的大量参数更新，同时减少联邦学习中的数据传输和本地计算开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型发展，其依赖的公共数据面临枯竭风险，利用组织内部私有数据提升大模型性能成为关键挑战。传统联邦学习结合模型微调虽然减少了可训练参数，但处理高维特征空间仍带来巨大计算开销。

Method: IFed-ICL框架借鉴联邦学习思想建立新型分布式协作范式，将客户端本地上下文示例转换为隐式向量表示，在推理阶段进行分布式协作计算，并通过注入模型残差流来增强模型性能。

Conclusion: IFed-ICL能够利用本地私有域数据进行高效的分布式上下文学习，显著提升模型在特定任务上的性能。

Abstract: As large language models continue to develop and expand, the extensive public data they rely on faces the risk of depletion. Consequently, leveraging private data within organizations to enhance the performance of large models has emerged as a key challenge. The federated learning paradigm, combined with model fine-tuning techniques, effectively reduces the number of trainable parameters. However,the necessity to process high-dimensional feature spaces results in substantial overall computational overhead. To address this issue, we propose the Implicit Federated In-Context Learning (IFed-ICL) framework. IFed-ICL draws inspiration from federated learning to establish a novel distributed collaborative paradigm, by converting client local context examples into implicit vector representations, it enables distributed collaborative computation during the inference phase and injects model residual streams to enhance model performance. Experiments demonstrate that our proposed method achieves outstanding performance across multiple text classification tasks. Compared to traditional methods, IFed-ICL avoids the extensive parameter updates required by conventional fine-tuning methods while reducing data transmission and local computation at the client level in federated learning. This enables efficient distributed context learning using local private-domain data, significantly improving model performance on specific tasks.

Motivation: Transformer模型在CV和NLP领域取得了突破性进展，但其中的非线性操作显著增加了推理延迟，给硬件加速带来了独特挑战。

Method: 提出QUARK框架，利用非线性操作中的共同模式实现电路共享，通过量化技术为Transformer模型中的所有非线性操作提供高效电路设计。

Abstract: Transformer-based models have revolutionized computer vision (CV) and natural language processing (NLP) by achieving state-of-the-art performance across a range of benchmarks. However, nonlinear operations in models significantly contribute to inference latency, presenting unique challenges for efficient hardware acceleration. To this end, we propose QUARK, a quantization-enabled FPGA acceleration framework that leverages common patterns in nonlinear operations to enable efficient circuit sharing, thereby reducing hardware resource requirements. QUARK targets all nonlinear operations within Transformer-based models, achieving high-performance approximation through a novel circuit-sharing design tailored to accelerate these operations. Our evaluation demonstrates that QUARK significantly reduces the computational overhead of nonlinear operators in mainstream Transformer architectures, achieving up to a 1.96 times end-to-end speedup over GPU implementations. Moreover, QUARK lowers the hardware overhead of nonlinear modules by more than 50% compared to prior approaches, all while maintaining high model accuracy -- and even substantially boosting accuracy under ultra-low-bit quantization.

TL;DR: 提出DTA框架，通过两阶段数据整理方法，将解题过程作为主要监督信号，在电信数学领域实现SOTA性能，同时显著提升边缘设备上的推理效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通用大语言模型在电信等垂直领域部署时面临数据稀缺、信息密度低和移动/边缘设备资源受限的挑战，需要高效的领域适应方法。

Method: DTA框架包含两个阶段：阶段I使用强教师模型合成多样化候选解；阶段II将教师解改写以对齐中间步骤和呈现风格，并通过一致性检查和反思评估进行信号感知的样本选择。

Result: 在TELEMATH数据集上达到72.45% pass@1准确率，比蒸馏训练提升17.65个百分点，比启用思维模式的Qwen3-32B基线提升2.94个百分点；在边缘推理设置下，能耗降低约42%，端到端延迟降低约60%。

Conclusion: 对齐解决方案生成方式能够为紧凑高效的监督提供高收益，为低资源垂直领域的领域适应提供了实用方案。

Abstract: General-purpose large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in verticals such as telecommunications, where adaptation is hindered by scarce, low-information-density corpora and tight mobile/edge constraints. We propose Data Trajectory Alignment (DTA), a two-phase, model-agnostic data curation framework that treats solution processes - not only final answers - as first-class supervision. Phase I (Initializing) synthesizes diverse, high-coverage candidates using an ensemble of strong teachers. Phase II (DTA) rewrites teacher solutions to align intermediate steps and presentation style with the target student's inductive biases and then performs signal-aware exemplar selection via agreement checks and reflection-based judging. Instantiated on telecommunications mathematics (e.g., link budgets, SNR/AMC selection, and power-control feasibility), DTA yields state-of-the-art (SOTA) accuracy on TELEMATH without enabling explicit "thinking" modes: 72.45% pass@1, surpassing distilled-only training by +17.65 points and outperforming a strong baseline (Qwen3-32B with thinking enabled) by +2.94 points. Token-shift analyses indicate that DTA concentrates gains on logical-structural discourse markers rather than merely amplifying domain nouns, indicating improved reasoning scaffolding. Under edge-like inference settings, DTA improves efficiency by reducing reliance on multi-sample voting and disabling expensive reasoning heuristics, cutting energy per output token by ~42% versus Qwen3-32B (thinking mode enabled) and end-to-end latency by ~60% versus Qwen3-32B (thinking mode disabled). These results demonstrate that aligning how solutions are produced enables compact, high-yield supervision that is effective for both accuracy and efficiency, offering a practical recipe for domain adaptation in low-resource verticals beyond telecom.

TL;DR: 该论文分析了变分自编码器(VAE)在协同过滤中的协作机制，提出了潜在共享半径的概念，研究了局部和全局协作的平衡，并提出了锚点正则化器来稳定用户表示。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VAE在推荐系统中广泛应用，但输入掩码技术虽然能提升性能，其理论机制尚未充分探索。需要理解VAE中协作如何产生，以及如何平衡局部和全局协作。

Method: 1. 推导潜在共享半径来分析用户间的协作影响；2. 比较β-KL正则化和输入掩码两种促进全局混合的机制；3. 提出锚点正则化器来对齐用户后验分布和物品嵌入，稳定用户表示。

Conclusion: VAE协同过滤中的协作由潜在邻近性主导，输入掩码通过几何收缩和扩张促进全局协作，而锚点正则化器能有效平衡用户身份保持和全局一致性。

Abstract: Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) are a powerful alternative to matrix factorization for recommendation. A common technique in VAE-based collaborative filtering (CF) consists in applying binary input masking to user interaction vectors, which improves performance but remains underexplored theoretically. In this work, we analyze how collaboration arises in VAE-based CF and show it is governed by latent proximity: we derive a latent sharing radius that informs when an SGD update on one user strictly reduces the loss on another user, with influence decaying as the latent Wasserstein distance increases. We further study the induced geometry: with clean inputs, VAE-based CF primarily exploits \emph{local} collaboration between input-similar users and under-utilizes global collaboration between far-but-related users. We compare two mechanisms that encourage \emph{global} mixing and characterize their trade-offs: (1) $β$-KL regularization directly tightens the information bottleneck, promoting posterior overlap but risking representational collapse if too large; (2) input masking induces stochastic geometric contractions and expansions, which can bring distant users onto the same latent neighborhood but also introduce neighborhood drift. To preserve user identity while enabling global consistency, we propose an anchor regularizer that aligns user posteriors with item embeddings, stabilizing users under masking and facilitating signal sharing across related items. Our analyses are validated on the Netflix, MovieLens-20M, and Million Song datasets. We also successfully deployed our proposed algorithm on an Amazon streaming platform following a successful online experiment.

Conclusion: MASS框架在现实世界低资源睡眠监测环境中具有高效和可扩展部署的潜力。

Abstract: Automatic sleep staging plays a vital role in assessing sleep quality and diagnosing sleep disorders. Most existing methods rely heavily on long and continuous EEG recordings, which poses significant challenges for data acquisition in resource-constrained systems, such as wearable or home-based monitoring systems. In this paper, we propose the task of resource-efficient sleep staging, which aims to reduce the amount of signal collected per sleep epoch while maintaining reliable classification performance. To solve this task, we adopt the masking and prompt learning strategy and propose a novel framework called Mask-Aware Sleep Staging (MASS). Specifically, we design a multi-level masking strategy to promote effective feature modeling under partial and irregular observations. To mitigate the loss of contextual information introduced by masking, we further propose a hierarchical prompt learning mechanism that aggregates unmasked data into a global prompt, serving as a semantic anchor for guiding both patch-level and epoch-level feature modeling. MASS is evaluated on four datasets, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance, especially when the amount of data is very limited. This result highlights its potential for efficient and scalable deployment in real-world low-resource sleep monitoring environments.

TL;DR: 本文提出Geo-Sharing方法，从群论视角重新定义参数共享，通过二阶几何准则选择共享组，在保持性能的同时实现高效压缩。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代深度模型参数量巨大，导致推理时内存占用高，限制了实际部署。现有参数共享方法局限于相邻层，缺乏对跨层共享的系统分析，且配置空间呈指数级增长，使得穷举搜索计算不可行。

Method: 将参数共享重新定义为在模型参数空间中引入结构对称性，提出基于泰勒展开和Hessian谱的二阶几何准则，通过将扰动投影到Hessian的低曲率特征子空间来选择共享组，最小化性能影响。

Result: 在多种架构和任务中，Geo-Sharing始终优于最先进的启发式共享策略，在更高压缩比下实现更小的精度损失。

Conclusion: Geo-Sharing提供了一种原则性和可扩展的配置过程，有效解决了参数共享中的配置空间爆炸问题。

Abstract: Modern deep models have massive parameter sizes, leading to high inference-time memory usage that limits practical deployment. Parameter sharing, a form of structured compression, effectively reduces redundancy, but existing approaches remain heuristic-restricted to adjacent layers and lacking a systematic analysis for cross-layer sharing. However, extending sharing across multiple layers leads to an exponentially expanding configuration space, making exhaustive search computationally infeasible and forming a critical bottleneck for parameter sharing. We recast parameter sharing from a group-theoretic perspective as introducing structural symmetries in the model's parameter space. A sharing configuration can be described by a coloring function $α:L\rightarrow C$ (L: layer indices and C: sharing classes), which determines inter-layer sharing groups while preserving structural symmetry. To determine the coloring function, we propose a second-order geometric criterion based on Taylor expansion and the Hessian spectrum. By projecting perturbations onto the Hessian's low-curvature eigensubspace, the criterion provides an analytic rule for selecting sharing groups that minimize performance impact, yielding a principled and scalable configuration procedure. Across diverse architectures and tasks, Geo-Sharing consistently outperforms state-of-the-art heuristic sharing strategies, achieving higher compression ratios with smaller accuracy degradation.

Motivation: 现有的因果发现方法通常假设完美先验知识或只能处理特定类型的错误，当面对未知位置和类型的错误约束时性能会显著下降。

Method: 首先通过代理模型评估不完美结构约束的可信度，然后使用稀疏惩罚项衡量学习到的邻接矩阵与约束邻接矩阵之间的损失。当理想假设被违反时，引入多任务学习框架通过多梯度下降联合最小化两个目标。

Result: 在多种噪声条件和结构方程模型类型下进行的大量实验表明，该方法在不完美结构约束下具有有效性和高效性。

Conclusion: 该方法能够在线性和非线性设置下保持鲁棒性，成功解决了不完美先验知识下的因果发现问题。

Abstract: Robust causal discovery from observational data under imperfect prior knowledge remains a significant and largely unresolved challenge. Existing methods typically presuppose perfect priors or can only handle specific, pre-identified error types. And their performance degrades substantially when confronted with flawed constraints of unknown location and type. This decline arises because most of them rely on inflexible and biased thresholding strategies that may conflict with the data distribution. To overcome these limitations, we propose to harmonizes knowledge and data through prior alignment and conflict resolution. First, we assess the credibility of imperfect structural constraints through a surrogate model, which then guides a sparse penalization term measuring the loss between the learned and constrained adjacency matrices. We theoretically prove that, under ideal assumption, the knowledge-driven objective aligns with the data-driven objective. Furthermore, to resolve conflicts when this assumption is violated, we introduce a multi-task learning framework optimized via multi-gradient descent, jointly minimizing both objectives. Our proposed method is robust to both linear and nonlinear settings. Extensive experiments, conducted under diverse noise conditions and structural equation model types, demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our method under imperfect structural constraints.

Abstract: Transitioning to sustainable and resilient energy systems requires navigating complex and interdependent trade-offs across environmental, social, and resource dimensions. Neglecting these trade-offs can lead to unintended consequences across sectors. However, existing assessments often evaluate emerging energy pathways and their impacts in silos, overlooking critical interactions such as regional resource competition and cumulative impacts. We present an integrated modeling framework that couples agent-based modeling and Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) to simulate how energy transition pathways interact with regional resource competition, ecological constraints, and community-level burdens. We apply the model to a case study in Southern California. The results demonstrate how integrated and multiscale decision making can shape energy pathway deployment and reveal spatially explicit trade-offs under scenario-driven constraints. This modeling framework can further support more adaptive and resilient energy transition planning on spatial and institutional scales.

Conclusion: MIP-Editor在多模态任务中实现了优异的遗忘性能，同时有效保持了模型的通用能力，为解决多模态大语言模型的知识遗忘问题提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) extend foundation models to real-world applications by integrating inputs such as text and vision. However, their broad knowledge capacity raises growing concerns about privacy leakage, toxicity mitigation, and intellectual property violations. Machine Unlearning (MU) offers a practical solution by selectively forgetting targeted knowledge while preserving overall model utility. When applied to MLLMs, existing neuron-editing-based MU approaches face two fundamental challenges: (1) forgetting becomes inconsistent across modalities because existing point-wise attribution methods fail to capture the structured, layer-by-layer information flow that connects different modalities; and (2) general knowledge performance declines when sensitive neurons that also support important reasoning paths are pruned, as this disrupts the model's ability to generalize. To alleviate these limitations, we propose a multimodal influential neuron path editor (MIP-Editor) for MU. Our approach introduces modality-specific attribution scores to identify influential neuron paths responsible for encoding forget-set knowledge and applies influential-path-aware neuron-editing via representation misdirection. This strategy also enables effective and coordinated forgetting across modalities while preserving the model's general capabilities. Experimental results demonstrate that MIP-Editor achieves a superior unlearning performance on multimodal tasks, with a maximum forgetting rate of 87.75% and up to 54.26% improvement in general knowledge retention. On textual tasks, MIP-Editor achieves up to 80.65% forgetting and preserves 77.9% of general performance. Codes are available at https://github.com/PreckLi/MIP-Editor.

Conclusion: DVWU框架能广泛适应现有机器遗忘方法，通过考虑数据价值异质性显著提升遗忘后模型的性能

Abstract: As the right to be forgotten becomes legislated worldwide, machine unlearning mechanisms have emerged to efficiently update models for data deletion and enhance user privacy protection. However, existing machine unlearning algorithms frequently neglect the fact that different data points may contribute unequally to model performance (i.e., heterogeneous data values). Treat them equally in machine unlearning procedure can potentially degrading the performance of updated models. To address this limitation, we propose Data Value-Weighted Unlearning (DVWU), a general unlearning framework that accounts for data value heterogeneity into the unlearning process. Specifically, we design a weighting strategy based on data values, which are then integrated into the unlearning procedure to enable differentiated unlearning for data points with varying utility to the model. The DVWU framework can be broadly adapted to various existing machine unlearning methods. We use the one-step Newton update as an example for implementation, developing both output and objective perturbation algorithms to achieve certified unlearning. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our methods achieve superior predictive performance and robustness compared to conventional unlearning approaches. We further show the extensibility of our framework on gradient ascent method by incorporating the proposed weighting strategy into the gradient terms, highlighting the adaptability of DVWU for broader gradient-based deep unlearning methods.

Conclusion: FedNET是一个实用的预测性流量工程和容量规划工具，能够在关键压力状态出现前提前识别高风险链路，同时保护网络数据隐私。

Abstract: We propose FedNET, a proactive and privacy-preserving framework for early identification of high-risk links in large-scale communication networks, that leverages a distributed multi-step traffic forecasting method. FedNET employs Federated Learning (FL) to model the temporal evolution of node-level traffic in a distributed manner, enabling accurate multi-step-ahead predictions (e.g., several hours to days) without exposing sensitive network data. Using these node-level forecasts and known routing information, FedNET estimates the future link-level utilization by aggregating traffic contributions across all source-destination pairs. The links are then ranked according to the predicted load intensity and temporal variability, providing an early warning signal for potential high-risk links. We compare the federated traffic prediction of FedNET against a centralized multi-step learning baseline and then systematically analyze the impact of history and prediction window sizes on forecast accuracy using the $R^2$ score. Results indicate that FL achieves accuracy close to centralized training, with shorter prediction horizons consistently yielding the highest accuracy ($R^2 >0.92$), while longer horizons providing meaningful forecasts ($R^2 \approx 0.45\text{--}0.55$). We further validate the efficacy of the FedNET framework in predicting network utilization on a realistic network topology and demonstrate that it consistently identifies high-risk links well in advance (i.e., three days ahead) of the critical stress states emerging, making it a practical tool for anticipatory traffic engineering and capacity planning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准Transformer架构在推理时仅进行前向计算，缺乏内部循环。本研究旨在实现无需外部循环的内部递归，让先前的潜在状态能动态重新进入计算流，近似自指计算。

Method: 开发FH-RL机制，整合快速权重关联记忆、稳态正则化和学习重入反馈。通过控制实验扫描重入增益γ，使用三个新指标评估内部动态：信息重入比(IRR)、特征谱递归指数(ESRI)和表示漂移周期性(RDP)。

Result: 重入量随γ增加而增加，学习反馈矩阵Wr保持有界并在中等增益时更具结构化。关键发现在γ≈0.10-0.20处出现稳定反射带，此时内部反馈表达力最大且光谱稳定：IRR平滑上升，ESRI接近零，RDP呈现一致低频周期。

Conclusion: 研究证明，通过反馈放大与稳态调节的平衡，可以产生类似思维的反射性内部处理，将现代快速权重架构与皮层重入和递归认知理论联系起来。

Abstract: This study introduces the Fast-Weights Homeostatic Reentry Layer (FH-RL), a neural mechanism that integrates fast-weight associative memory, homeostatic regularization, and learned reentrant feedback to approximate self-referential computation in neural networks. Unlike standard transformer architectures that operate in a purely feedforward manner during inference, FH-RL enables internal recurrence without external looping, allowing prior latent states to be dynamically re-entered into the ongoing computation stream. We conduct controlled experiments sweeping the reentry gain $γ$ and evaluate emergent internal dynamics using three novel metrics: the Information Reentry Ratio (IRR), Eigen-Spectrum Recursion Index (ESRI), and Representational Drift Periodicity (RDP). Results show that reentry quantity increases proportionally with~$γ$, while the learned feedback matrix $W_r$ remains bounded and becomes more structured at moderate gains. Critically, a stable reflective band emerges around $γ\approx 0.10-0.20$, where internal feedback is maximally expressive yet spectrally stable: IRR rises smoothly, ESRI remains near zero, and RDP exhibits consistent low-frequency cycles. These findings provide quantitative evidence that reflective, thought-like internal processing can arise from a principled balance between feedback amplification and homeostatic regulation, linking modern fast-weight architectures to theories of cortical reentry and recursive cognition.

First, a physics informed conditional neural field is trained to approximate the nonlinear parametric solutionof the governing equations. This establishes a continuous mapping between the parameter and solution spaces, which can then be evaluated for a given parameter at any spatial resolution. Second, since the neural approximation may not be exact, it is subsequently refined using a Newton-based correction initialized by the neural output. To evaluate the effectiveness of this hybrid approach, we compare three solution strategies: (i) the standard Newton-Raphson solver used in NFEM, which is robust and accurate but computationally demanding; (ii) physics-informed neural operators, which provide rapid inference but may lose accuracy outside the training distribution and resolution; and (iii) the neural-initialized Newton (NiN) strategy, which combines the efficiency of neural operators with the robustness of NFEM. The results demonstrate that the proposed hybrid approach reduces computational cost while preserving accuracy, highlighting its potential to accelerate large-scale nonlinear simulations.

Conclusion: 生成的多样化轨迹数据显著增强了策略学习的鲁棒性和跨任务泛化能力，在在线设置中表现出色。

Abstract: Model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) typically relies on modeling environment dynamics for data efficiency. However, due to the accumulation of model errors over long-horizon rollouts, such methods often face challenges in maintaining modeling stability. To address this, we propose CtrlFlow, a trajectory-level synthetic method using conditional flow matching (CFM), which directly modeling the distribution of trajectories from initial states to high-return terminal states without explicitly modeling the environment transition function. Our method ensures optimal trajectory sampling by minimizing the control energy governed by the non-linear Controllability Gramian Matrix, while the generated diverse trajectory data significantly enhances the robustness and cross-task generalization of policy learning. In online settings, CtrlFlow demonstrates the better performance on common MuJoCo benchmark tasks than dynamics models and achieves superior sample efficiency compared to standard MBRL methods.

Abstract: Monte Carlo random walk methods are widely used in capacitance extraction for their mesh-free formulation and inherent parallelism. However, modern semiconductor technologies with densely packed structures present significant challenges in unbiasedly sampling transition domains in walk steps with multiple high-contrast dielectric materials. We present DeepRWCap, a machine learning-guided random walk solver that predicts the transition quantities required to guide each step of the walk. These include Poisson kernels, gradient kernels, signs and magnitudes of weights. DeepRWCap employs a two-stage neural architecture that decomposes structured outputs into face-wise distributions and spatial kernels on cube faces. It uses 3D convolutional networks to capture volumetric dielectric interactions and 2D depthwise separable convolutions to model localized kernel behavior. The design incorporates grid-based positional encodings and structural design choices informed by cube symmetries to reduce learning redundancy and improve generalization. Trained on 100,000 procedurally generated dielectric configurations, DeepRWCap achieves a mean relative error of $1.24\pm0.53$\% when benchmarked against the commercial Raphael solver on the self-capacitance estimation of 10 industrial designs spanning 12 to 55 nm nodes. Compared to the state-of-the-art stochastic difference method Microwalk, DeepRWCap achieves an average 23\% speedup. On complex designs with runtimes over 10 s, it reaches an average 49\% acceleration.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 确定全连接神经网络的最小宽度是深度神经网络理论研究中的基本问题，这对于网络设计和训练具有重要意义。

Method: 通过分析不同激活函数（ELU、SELU、LeakyReLU、CELU、Softplus、ReLU等）的特性，结合Poincaré-Miranda定理构建几何方法，推导最小宽度的上下界。

Result: 对于ELU、SELU激活函数，最小宽度w_min ≤ max(2d_x+1, d_y)，当d_y=2d_x时达到上界；对于LeakyReLU、ELU、CELU、SELU、Softplus，d_x+1 ≤ w_min ≤ d_x+d_y；对于ReLU等单射函数，w_min ≥ d_y + 1_{d_x<d_y≤2d_x}。

Conclusion: 论文为不同激活函数的全连接神经网络提供了最小宽度的理论界限，并通过新的几何方法为相关理论提供了更直观的证明。

Abstract: Determining the minimum width of fully connected neural networks has become a fundamental problem in recent theoretical studies of deep neural networks. In this paper, we study the lower bounds and upper bounds of the minimum width required for fully connected neural networks in order to have universal approximation capability, which is important in network design and training. We show that $w_{min}\leq\max(2d_x+1, d_y)$ for networks with ELU, SELU, and the upper bound of this inequality is attained when $d_y=2d_x$, where $d_x$, $d_y$ denote the input and output dimensions, respectively. Besides, we show that $d_x+1\leq w_{min}\leq d_x+d_y$ for networks with LeakyReLU, ELU, CELU, SELU, Softplus, by proving that ReLU can be approximated by these activation functions. In addition, in the case that the activation function is injective or can be uniformly approximated by a sequence of injective functions (e.g., ReLU), we present a new proof of the inequality $w_{min}\ge d_y+\mathbf{1}_{d_x<d_y\leq2d_x}$ by constructing a more intuitive example via a new geometric approach based on Poincar$\acute{\text{e}}$-Miranda Theorem.

*Lionel Levine,Sajjad Ghiasvand,Haniyeh Ehsani Oskouie,Majid Sarrafzadeh*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: M2M-DC是一个双尺度、形状安全的压缩框架，通过互信息引导的块剪枝与渐进式内部切片和分阶段知识蒸馏相结合，在保持残差形状不变性的同时实现模型压缩。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发一个通用的压缩框架，能够在保持模型结构完整性的同时显著减少计算量和参数数量，实现部署就绪的紧凑模型。

Method: 首先基于标签感知互信息对残差块进行排序并剪枝最不重要的单元，然后交替进行短知识蒸馏阶段与残差安全的通道切片，包括阶段平面切片和可选的中通道修剪。

Result: 在CIFAR-100上，ResNet-18达到85.46%准确率，参数减少28%，计算量减少37%；ResNet-34达到85.02%准确率，参数减少26%，计算量减少26%；MobileNetV2准确率提升2.5个百分点，参数减少73%，计算量减少76%。

Conclusion: M2M-DC提供了一个紧凑实用的压缩方案，能够生成部署就绪的模型，在显著减少计算成本的同时匹配或超越教师模型的准确率，且具有跨架构的通用性。

Abstract: We introduce MI-to-Mid Distilled Compression (M2M-DC), a two-scale, shape-safe compression framework that interleaves information-guided block pruning with progressive inner slicing and staged knowledge distillation (KD). First, M2M-DC ranks residual (or inverted-residual) blocks by a label-aware mutual information (MI) signal and removes the least informative units (structured prune-after-training). It then alternates short KD phases with stage-coherent, residual-safe channel slicing: (i) stage "planes" (co-slicing conv2 out-channels with the downsample path and next-stage inputs), and (ii) an optional mid-channel trim (conv1 out / bn1 / conv2 in). This targets complementary redundancy, whole computational motifs and within-stage width while preserving residual shape invariants. On CIFAR-100, M2M-DC yields a clean accuracy-compute frontier. For ResNet-18, we obtain 85.46% Top-1 with 3.09M parameters and 0.0139 GMacs (72% params, 63% GMacs vs. teacher; mean final 85.29% over three seeds). For ResNet-34, we reach 85.02% Top-1 with 5.46M params and 0.0195 GMacs (74% / 74% vs. teacher; mean final 84.62%). Extending to inverted-residuals, MobileNetV2 achieves a mean final 68.54% Top-1 at 1.71M params (27%) and 0.0186 conv GMacs (24%), improving over the teacher's 66.03% by +2.5 points across three seeds. Because M2M-DC exposes only a thin, architecture-aware interface (blocks, stages, and down sample/skip wiring), it generalizes across residual CNNs and extends to inverted-residual families with minor legalization rules. The result is a compact, practical recipe for deployment-ready models that match or surpass teacher accuracy at a fraction of the compute.

Conclusion: iTimER通过利用重建误差作为学习信号，有效提升了不规则采样时间序列的表示学习性能，证明了重建误差在时间序列建模中的重要性。

Abstract: Irregularly sampled time series (ISTS), characterized by non-uniform time intervals with natural missingness, are prevalent in real-world applications. Existing approaches for ISTS modeling primarily rely on observed values to impute unobserved ones or infer latent dynamics. However, these methods overlook a critical source of learning signal: the reconstruction error inherently produced during model training. Such error implicitly reflects how well a model captures the underlying data structure and can serve as an informative proxy for unobserved values. To exploit this insight, we propose iTimER, a simple yet effective self-supervised pre-training framework for ISTS representation learning. iTimER models the distribution of reconstruction errors over observed values and generates pseudo-observations for unobserved timestamps through a mixup strategy between sampled errors and the last available observations. This transforms unobserved timestamps into noise-aware training targets, enabling meaningful reconstruction signals. A Wasserstein metric aligns reconstruction error distributions between observed and pseudo-observed regions, while a contrastive learning objective enhances the discriminability of learned representations. Extensive experiments on classification, interpolation, and forecasting tasks demonstrate that iTimER consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods under the ISTS setting.

Conclusion: NCGSB提供了更广泛的随机过程建模能力，CWG实现了高效的非迭代求解，支持任务特定的引导生成，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: The Schrödinger Bridge provides a principled framework for modeling stochastic processes between distributions; however, existing methods are limited by energy-conservation assumptions, which constrains the bridge's shape preventing it from model varying-energy phenomena. To overcome this, we introduce the non-conservative generalized Schrödinger bridge (NCGSB), a novel, energy-varying reformulation based on contact Hamiltonian mechanics. By allowing energy to change over time, the NCGSB provides a broader class of real-world stochastic processes, capturing richer and more faithful intermediate dynamics. By parameterizing the Wasserstein manifold, we lift the bridge problem to a tractable geodesic computation in a finite-dimensional space. Unlike computationally expensive iterative solutions, our contact Wasserstein geodesic (CWG) is naturally implemented via a ResNet architecture and relies on a non-iterative solver with near-linear complexity. Furthermore, CWG supports guided generation by modulating a task-specific distance metric. We validate our framework on tasks including manifold navigation, molecular dynamics predictions, and image generation, demonstrating its practical benefits and versatility.

Conclusion: TuckA方法通过集成多个小型专家，有效解决了复杂任务中数据多样性的挑战，在保持参数效率的同时显著提升了模型性能。

Abstract: Efficiently fine-tuning pre-trained models for downstream tasks is a key challenge in the era of foundation models. Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) presents a promising solution, achieving performance comparable to full fine-tuning by updating only a small number of adaptation weights per layer. Traditional PEFT methods typically rely on a single expert, where the adaptation weight is a low-rank matrix. However, for complex tasks, the data's inherent diversity poses a significant challenge for such models, as a single adaptation weight cannot adequately capture the features of all samples. To address this limitation, we explore how to integrate multiple small adaptation experts into a compact structure to defeat a large adapter. Specifically, we propose Tucker Adaptation (TuckA), a method with four key properties: (i) We use Tucker decomposition to create a compact 3D tensor where each slice naturally serves as an expert. The low-rank nature of this decomposition ensures that the number of parameters scales efficiently as more experts are added. (ii) We introduce a hierarchical strategy that organizes these experts into groups at different granularities, allowing the model to capture both local and global data patterns. (iii) We develop an efficient batch-level routing mechanism, which reduces the router's parameter size by a factor of $L$ compared to routing at every adapted layer (where $L$ is the number of adapted layers) (iv) We propose data-aware initialization to achieve loss-free expert load balancing based on theoretical analysis. Extensive experiments on benchmarks in natural language understanding, image classification, and mathematical reasoning speak to the efficacy of TuckA, offering a new and effective solution to the PEFT problem.

Conclusion: DeepBooTS通过增强的集成结构和残差校正机制，显著提高了对概念漂移的鲁棒性，同时增强了方法的通用性和可解释性。

Abstract: Time-Series (TS) exhibits pronounced non-stationarity. Consequently, most forecasting methods display compromised robustness to concept drift, despite the prevalent application of instance normalization. We tackle this challenge by first analysing concept drift through a bias-variance lens and proving that weighted ensemble reduces variance without increasing bias. These insights motivate DeepBooTS, a novel end-to-end dual-stream residual-decreasing boosting method that progressively reconstructs the intrinsic signal. In our design, each block of a deep model becomes an ensemble of learners with an auxiliary output branch forming a highway to the final prediction. The block-wise outputs correct the residuals of previous blocks, leading to a learning-driven decomposition of both inputs and targets. This method enhances versatility and interpretability while substantially improving robustness to concept drift. Extensive experiments, including those on large-scale datasets, show that the proposed method outperforms existing methods by a large margin, yielding an average performance improvement of 15.8% across various datasets, establishing a new benchmark for TS forecasting.

TL;DR: COGNOS提出了一种通用的时间序列异常检测增强框架，通过高斯白噪声正则化和卡尔曼平滑后处理，显著改善了基于重构方法的异常检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于重构的时间序列异常检测方法普遍依赖MSE损失，导致重构残差存在统计缺陷，产生噪声大、不稳定的异常分数，影响检测可靠性。

Method: COGNOS包含两个核心组件：1）高斯白噪声正则化策略，在训练时约束模型输出残差符合高斯白噪声分布；2）卡尔曼平滑后处理器，作为统计最优估计器对原始异常分数进行去噪。

Result: 在多个真实世界基准数据集上对12种不同骨干模型进行实验，COGNOS平均F分数提升了57.9%，证明其高度有效性。

Conclusion: 直接正则化输出统计特性是显著改进异常检测系统的强大且可泛化的策略。

Abstract: Reconstruction-based methods are a dominant paradigm in time series anomaly detection (TSAD), however, their near-universal reliance on Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss results in statistically flawed reconstruction residuals. This fundamental weakness leads to noisy, unstable anomaly scores with a poor signal-to-noise ratio, hindering reliable detection. To address this, we propose Constrained Gaussian-Noise Optimization and Smoothing (COGNOS), a universal, model-agnostic enhancement framework that tackles this issue at its source. COGNOS introduces a novel Gaussian-White Noise Regularization strategy during training, which directly constrains the model's output residuals to conform to a Gaussian white noise distribution. This engineered statistical property creates the ideal precondition for our second contribution: a Kalman Smoothing Post-processor that provably operates as a statistically optimal estimator to denoise the raw anomaly scores. The synergy between these two components allows COGNOS to robustly separate the true anomaly signal from random fluctuations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that COGNOS is highly effective, delivering an average F-score uplift of 57.9% when applied to 12 diverse backbone models across multiple real-world benchmark datasets. Our work reveals that directly regularizing output statistics is a powerful and generalizable strategy for significantly improving anomaly detection systems.

Result: 初步结果显示清晰的epoch-wise双下降曲线，策略进入第二下降区域与策略熵的持续显著降低相关，表明过度参数化作为隐式正则化器引导策略走向更稳健的平坦最小值。

Conclusion: 这些发现确立了双下降作为深度强化学习中的一个因素，并为设计更通用、可迁移和鲁棒的智能体提供了基于信息的机制。

Abstract: The double descent (DD) paradox, where over-parameterized models see generalization improve past the interpolation point, remains largely unexplored in the non-stationary domain of Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL). We present preliminary evidence that DD exists in model-free DRL, investigating it systematically across varying model capacity using the Actor-Critic framework. We rely on an information-theoretic metric, Policy Entropy, to measure policy uncertainty throughout training. Preliminary results show a clear epoch-wise DD curve; the policy's entrance into the second descent region correlates with a sustained, significant reduction in Policy Entropy. This entropic decay suggests that over-parameterization acts as an implicit regularizer, guiding the policy towards robust, flatter minima in the loss landscape. These findings establish DD as a factor in DRL and provide an information-based mechanism for designing agents that are more general, transferable, and robust.

Abstract: Accurate day-ahead electricity price forecasting (DAEPF) is critical for the efficient operation of power systems, but extreme condition and market anomalies pose significant challenges to existing forecasting methods. To overcome these challenges, this paper proposes a novel hybrid deep learning framework that integrates a Distilled Attention Transformer (DAT) model and an Autoencoder Self-regression Model (ASM). The DAT leverages a self-attention mechanism to dynamically assign higher weights to critical segments of historical data, effectively capturing both long-term trends and short-term fluctuations. Concurrently, the ASM employs unsupervised learning to detect and isolate anomalous patterns induced by extreme conditions, such as heavy rain, heat waves, or human festivals. Experiments on datasets sampled from California and Shandong Province demonstrate that our framework significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in prediction accuracy, robustness, and computational efficiency. Our framework thus holds promise for enhancing grid resilience and optimizing market operations in future power systems.

Conclusion: 提出的SAMD和NLD策略能够有效缓解ANN和SNN之间的架构差异，提升知识蒸馏效果。

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) become popular due to excellent energy efficiency, yet facing challenges for effective model training. Recent works improve this by introducing knowledge distillation (KD) techniques, with the pre-trained artificial neural networks (ANNs) used as teachers and the target SNNs as students. This is commonly accomplished through a straightforward element-wise alignment of intermediate features and prediction logits from ANNs and SNNs, often neglecting the intrinsic differences between their architectures. Specifically, ANN's outputs exhibit a continuous distribution, whereas SNN's outputs are characterized by sparsity and discreteness. To mitigate this issue, we introduce two innovative KD strategies. Firstly, we propose the Saliency-scaled Activation Map Distillation (SAMD), which aligns the spike activation map of the student SNN with the class-aware activation map of the teacher ANN. Rather than performing KD directly on the raw %and distinct features of ANN and SNN, our SAMD directs the student to learn from saliency activation maps that exhibit greater semantic and distribution consistency. Additionally, we propose a Noise-smoothed Logits Distillation (NLD), which utilizes Gaussian noise to smooth the sparse logits of student SNN, facilitating the alignment with continuous logits from teacher ANN. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods. Code is available~\footnote{https://github.com/SinoLeu/CKDSNN.git}.

Abstract: Currently, machine learning is widely used across various domains, including time series data analysis. However, some machine learning models function as black boxes, making interpretability a critical concern. One approach to address this issue is counterfactual explanation (CE), which aims to provide insights into model predictions. This study focuses on the relatively underexplored problem of generating counterfactual explanations for time series forecasting. We propose a method for extracting CEs in time series forecasting using exogenous variables, which are frequently encountered in fields such as business and marketing. In addition, we present methods for analyzing the influence of each variable over an entire time series, generating CEs by altering only specific variables, and evaluating the quality of the resulting CEs. We validate the proposed method through theoretical analysis and empirical experiments, showcasing its accuracy and practical applicability. These contributions are expected to support real-world decision-making based on time series data analysis.

Abstract: In the training of large deep neural networks, there is a need for vast amounts of training data. To meet this need, data is collected from multiple domains, such as Wikipedia and GitHub. These domains are heterogeneous in both data quality and the diversity of information they provide. This raises the question of how much we should rely on each domain. Several methods have attempted to address this issue by assigning sampling weights to each data domain using heuristics or approximations. As a first step toward a deeper understanding of the role of data mixing, this work revisits the problem by studying two kinds of weights: sampling weights, which control how much each domain contributes in a batch, and loss weights, which scale the loss from each domain during training. Through a rigorous study of linear regression, we show that these two weights play complementary roles. First, they can reduce the variance of gradient estimates in iterative methods such as stochastic gradient descent (SGD). Second, they can improve generalization performance by reducing the generalization gap. We provide both theoretical and empirical support for these claims. We further study the joint dynamics of sampling weights and loss weights, examining how they can be combined to capture both contributions.

*Daniel De Dios Allegue,Jinke He,Frans A. Oliehoek*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 在部分可观测强化学习中，标准自注意力机制效率低下，因为它在所有历史标记上均匀分配权重。本文引入结构化归纳先验到动态头的自注意力机制中，包括任务特定窗口的每头记忆长度先验和学习平滑高斯权重的分布先验。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 强化学习轨迹稀疏且奖励驱动，标准自注意力机制无法有效强调对控制关键的少数转换，导致在部分可观测环境中的模型效率低下。

Method: 在基于Transformer的世界模型UniZero中引入两种结构化归纳先验：(1) 每头记忆长度先验，限制注意力到任务特定窗口；(2) 分布先验，学习对过去状态-动作对的平滑高斯加权。

Result: 在Atari 100k基准测试中，高斯先验实现了77%的相对改进，大多数效率提升来自高斯先验，它能平滑分配注意力到信息丰富的转换，而记忆长度先验往往因过于严格的截断而丢失有用信号。

Conclusion: 在具有非平稳时间依赖性的部分可观测强化学习领域，离散记忆窗口难以可靠学习，而平滑分布先验能灵活适应不同时间范围并产生更稳健的数据效率，将结构化时间先验直接编码到自注意力中能改善对信息丰富历史的优先级排序。

Abstract: Transformers have shown strong ability to model long-term dependencies and are increasingly adopted as world models in model-based reinforcement learning (RL) under partial observability. However, unlike natural language corpora, RL trajectories are sparse and reward-driven, making standard self-attention inefficient because it distributes weight uniformly across all past tokens rather than emphasizing the few transitions critical for control. To address this, we introduce structured inductive priors into the self-attention mechanism of the dynamics head: (i) per-head memory-length priors that constrain attention to task-specific windows, and (ii) distributional priors that learn smooth Gaussian weightings over past state-action pairs. We integrate these mechanisms into UniZero, a model-based RL agent with a Transformer-based world model that supports planning under partial observability. Experiments on the Atari 100k benchmark show that most efficiency gains arise from the Gaussian prior, which smoothly allocates attention to informative transitions, while memory-length priors often truncate useful signals with overly restrictive cut-offs. In particular, Gaussian Attention achieves a 77% relative improvement in mean human-normalized scores over UniZero. These findings suggest that in partially observable RL domains with non-stationary temporal dependencies, discrete memory windows are difficult to learn reliably, whereas smooth distributional priors flexibly adapt across horizons and yield more robust data efficiency. Overall, our results demonstrate that encoding structured temporal priors directly into self-attention improves the prioritization of informative histories for dynamics modeling under partial observability.

Conclusion: 该方法通过结合不同结构编码器的互补优势，有效解决了表格数据上的小样本学习问题，为表格数据的自监督学习提供了新思路。

Abstract: Deep neural networks often under-perform on tabular data due to their sensitivity to irrelevant features and a spectral bias toward smooth, low-frequency functions. These limitations hinder their ability to capture the sharp, high-frequency signals that often define tabular structure, especially under limited labeled samples. While self-supervised learning (SSL) offers promise in such settings, it remains challenging in tabular domains due to the lack of effective data augmentations. We propose a hybrid autoencoder that combines a neural encoder with an oblivious soft decision tree (OSDT) encoder, each guided by its own stochastic gating network that performs sample-specific feature selection. Together, these structurally different encoders and model-specific gating networks implement model-based augmentation, producing complementary input views tailored to each architecture. The two encoders, trained with a shared decoder and cross-reconstruction loss, learn distinct yet aligned representations that reflect their respective inductive biases. During training, the OSDT encoder (robust to noise and effective at modeling localized, high-frequency structure) guides the neural encoder toward representations more aligned with tabular data. At inference, only the neural encoder is used, preserving flexibility and SSL compatibility. Spectral analysis highlights the distinct inductive biases of each encoder. Our method achieves consistent gains in low-label classification and regression across diverse tabular datasets, outperforming deep and tree-based supervised baselines.

Conclusion: 该方法支持大规模自动化模板发现，为表格集合的检索增强生成、模型训练和批量数据清理等下游应用提供支持。

Abstract: Traditional methods for identifying structurally similar spreadsheets fail to capture the spatial layouts and type patterns defining templates. To quantify spreadsheet similarity, we introduce a hybrid distance metric that combines semantic embeddings, data type information, and spatial positioning. In order to calculate spreadsheet similarity, our method converts spreadsheets into cell-level embeddings and then uses aggregation techniques like Chamfer and Hausdorff distances. Experiments across template families demonstrate superior unsupervised clustering performance compared to the graph-based Mondrian baseline, achieving perfect template reconstruction (Adjusted Rand Index of 1.00 versus 0.90) on the FUSTE dataset. Our approach facilitates large-scale automated template discovery, which in turn enables downstream applications such as retrieval-augmented generation over tabular collections, model training, and bulk data cleaning.

Abstract: Efficiently and accurately determining the symmetry is a crucial step in the structural analysis of crystalline materials. Existing methods usually mindlessly apply deep learning models while ignoring the underlying chemical rules. More importantly, experiments show that they face a serious sub-property confusion SPC problem. To address the above challenges, from a decoupled perspective, we introduce the XRDecoupler framework, a problem-solving arsenal specifically designed to tackle the SPC problem. Imitating the thinking process of chemists, we innovatively incorporate multidimensional crystal symmetry information as superclass guidance to ensure that the model's prediction process aligns with chemical intuition. We further design a hierarchical PXRD pattern learning model and a multi-objective optimization approach to achieve high-quality representation and balanced optimization. Comprehensive evaluations on three mainstream databases (e.g., CCDC, CoREMOF, and InorganicData) demonstrate that XRDecoupler excels in performance, interpretability, and generalization.

Abstract: Bayesian inference, while foundational to probabilistic reasoning, is often hampered by the computational intractability of posterior distributions, particularly through the challenging evidence integral. Conventional approaches like Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) and Variational Inference (VI) face significant scalability and efficiency limitations. This paper introduces a novel, unifying framework for fast Bayesian updates by leveraging harmonic analysis. We demonstrate that representing the prior and likelihood in a suitable orthogonal basis transforms the Bayesian update rule into a spectral convolution. Specifically, the Fourier coefficients of the posterior are shown to be the normalized convolution of the prior and likelihood coefficients. To achieve computational feasibility, we introduce a spectral truncation scheme, which, for smooth functions, yields an exceptionally accurate finite-dimensional approximation and reduces the update to a circular convolution. This formulation allows us to exploit the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), resulting in a deterministic algorithm with O(N log N) complexity -- a substantial improvement over the O(N^2) cost of naive methods. We establish rigorous mathematical criteria for the applicability of our method, linking its efficiency to the smoothness and spectral decay of the involved distributions. The presented work offers a paradigm shift, connecting Bayesian computation to signal processing and opening avenues for real-time, sequential inference in a wide class of problems.

Abstract: Strategic classification~(SC) explores how individuals or entities modify their features strategically to achieve favorable classification outcomes. However, existing SC methods, which are largely based on linear models or shallow neural networks, face significant limitations in terms of scalability and capacity when applied to real-world datasets with significantly increasing scale, especially in financial services and the internet sector. In this paper, we investigate how to leverage large language models to design a more scalable and efficient SC framework, especially in the case of growing individuals engaged with decision-making processes. Specifically, we introduce GLIM, a gradient-free SC method grounded in in-context learning. During the feed-forward process of self-attention, GLIM implicitly simulates the typical bi-level optimization process of SC, including both the feature manipulation and decision rule optimization. Without fine-tuning the LLMs, our proposed GLIM enjoys the advantage of cost-effective adaptation in dynamic strategic environments. Theoretically, we prove GLIM can support pre-trained LLMs to adapt to a broad range of strategic manipulations. We validate our approach through experiments with a collection of pre-trained LLMs on real-world and synthetic datasets in financial and internet domains, demonstrating that our GLIM exhibits both robustness and efficiency, and offering an effective solution for large-scale SC tasks.

Abstract: Anxiety disorders impact millions globally, yet traditional diagnosis relies on clinical interviews, while machine learning models struggle with overfitting due to limited data. Large-scale data collection remains costly and time-consuming, restricting accessibility. To address this, we introduce the Hyperbolic Curvature Few-Shot Learning Network (HCFSLN), a novel Few-Shot Learning (FSL) framework for multimodal anxiety detection, integrating speech, physiological signals, and video data. HCFSLN enhances feature separability through hyperbolic embeddings, cross-modal attention, and an adaptive gating network, enabling robust classification with minimal data. We collected a multimodal anxiety dataset from 108 participants and benchmarked HCFSLN against six FSL baselines, achieving 88% accuracy, outperforming the best baseline by 14%. These results highlight the effectiveness of hyperbolic space for modeling anxiety-related speech patterns and demonstrate FSL's potential for anxiety classification.

Abstract: Large models have achieved remarkable performance across a range of reasoning and understanding tasks. Prior work often utilizes model ensembles or multi-agent systems to collaboratively generate responses, effectively operating in a server-to-server paradigm. However, such approaches do not align well with practical deployment settings, where a limited number of server-side models are shared by many clients under modern internet architectures. In this paper, we introduce \textbf{CoLM} (\textbf{Co}llaboration in \textbf{L}arge-\textbf{M}odels), a novel framework for collaborative reasoning that redefines cooperation among large models from a client-server perspective. Unlike traditional ensemble methods that rely on simultaneous inference from multiple models to produce a single output, CoLM allows the outputs of multiple models to be aggregated or shared, enabling each client model to independently refine and update its own generation based on these high-quality outputs. This design enables collaborative benefits by fully leveraging both client-side and shared server-side models. We further extend CoLM to vision-language models (VLMs), demonstrating its applicability beyond language tasks. Experimental results across multiple benchmarks show that CoLM consistently improves model performance on previously failed queries, highlighting the effectiveness of collaborative guidance in enhancing single-model capabilities.

Abstract: Virtual screening (VS) is an essential task in drug discovery, focusing on the identification of small-molecule ligands that bind to specific protein pockets. Existing deep learning methods, from early regression models to recent contrastive learning approaches, primarily rely on structural data while overlooking protein sequences, which are more accessible and can enhance generalizability. However, directly integrating protein sequences poses challenges due to the redundancy and noise in large-scale protein-ligand datasets. To address these limitations, we propose \textbf{S$^2$Drug}, a two-stage framework that explicitly incorporates protein \textbf{S}equence information and 3D \textbf{S}tructure context in protein-ligand contrastive representation learning. In the first stage, we perform protein sequence pretraining on ChemBL using an ESM2-based backbone, combined with a tailored data sampling strategy to reduce redundancy and noise on both protein and ligand sides. In the second stage, we fine-tune on PDBBind by fusing sequence and structure information through a residue-level gating module, while introducing an auxiliary binding site prediction task. This auxiliary task guides the model to accurately localize binding residues within the protein sequence and capture their 3D spatial arrangement, thereby refining protein-ligand matching. Across multiple benchmarks, S$^2$Drug consistently improves virtual screening performance and achieves strong results on binding site prediction, demonstrating the value of bridging sequence and structure in contrastive learning.

Abstract: Graph anomaly detection (GAD), which aims to detect outliers in graph-structured data, has received increasing research attention recently. However, existing GAD methods assume identical training and testing distributions, which is rarely valid in practice. In real-world scenarios, unseen but normal samples may emerge during deployment, leading to a normality shift that degrades the performance of GAD models trained on the original data. Through empirical analysis, we reveal that the degradation arises from (1) semantic confusion, where unseen normal samples are misinterpreted as anomalies due to their novel patterns, and (2) aggregation contamination, where the representations of seen normal nodes are distorted by unseen normals through message aggregation. While retraining or fine-tuning GAD models could be a potential solution to the above challenges, the high cost of model retraining and the difficulty of obtaining labeled data often render this approach impractical in real-world applications. To bridge the gap, we proposed a lightweight and plug-and-play Test-time adaptation framework for correcting Unseen Normal pattErns (TUNE) in GAD. To address semantic confusion, a graph aligner is employed to align the shifted data to the original one at the graph attribute level. Moreover, we utilize the minimization of representation-level shift as a supervision signal to train the aligner, which leverages the estimated aggregation contamination as a key indicator of normality shift. Extensive experiments on 10 real-world datasets demonstrate that TUNE significantly enhances the generalizability of pre-trained GAD models to both synthetic and real unseen normal patterns.

Abstract: Fairness concerns are increasingly critical as machine learning models are deployed in high-stakes applications. While existing fairness-aware methods typically intervene at the model level, they often suffer from high computational costs, limited scalability, and poor generalization. To address these challenges, we propose a Bayesian data selection framework that ensures fairness by aligning group-specific posterior distributions of model parameters and sample weights with a shared central distribution. Our framework supports flexible alignment via various distributional discrepancy measures, including Wasserstein distance, maximum mean discrepancy, and $f$-divergence, allowing geometry-aware control without imposing explicit fairness constraints. This data-centric approach mitigates group-specific biases in training data and improves fairness in downstream tasks, with theoretical guarantees. Experiments on benchmark datasets show that our method consistently outperforms existing data selection and model-based fairness methods in both fairness and accuracy.

Abstract: Deploying continuous-control reinforcement learning policies on embedded hardware requires meeting tight latency and power budgets. Small FPGAs can deliver these, but only if costly floating point pipelines are avoided. We study quantization-aware training (QAT) of policies for integer inference and we present a learning-to-hardware pipeline that automatically selects low-bit policies and synthesizes them to an Artix-7 FPGA. Across five MuJoCo tasks, we obtain policy networks that are competitive with full precision (FP32) policies but require as few as 3 or even only 2 bits per weight, and per internal activation value, as long as input precision is chosen carefully. On the target hardware, the selected policies achieve inference latencies on the order of microseconds and consume microjoules per action, favorably comparing to a quantized reference. Last, we observe that the quantized policies exhibit increased input noise robustness compared to the floating-point baseline.

Conclusion: 联邦聚类中质心披露会显著损害隐私，揭示了隐私与效率之间的根本冲突。

Abstract: Federated clustering allows multiple parties to discover patterns in distributed data without sharing raw samples. To reduce overhead, many protocols disclose intermediate centroids during training. While often treated as harmless for efficiency, whether such disclosure compromises privacy remains an open question. Prior analyses modeled the problem as a so-called Hidden Subset Sum Problem (HSSP) and argued that centroid release may be safe, since classical HSSP attacks fail to recover inputs.
  We revisit this question and uncover a new leakage mechanism: temporal regularities in $k$-means iterations create exploitable structure that enables perfect input reconstruction. Building on this insight, we propose Trajectory-Aware Reconstruction (TAR), an attack that combines temporal assignment information with algebraic analysis to recover exact original inputs. Our findings provide the first rigorous evidence, supported by a practical attack, that centroid disclosure in federated clustering significantly compromises privacy, exposing a fundamental tension between privacy and efficiency.

Abstract: We introduce a novel equivariant graph neural network (GNN) architecture designed to predict the tensorial response properties of molecules. Unlike traditional frameworks that focus on regressing scalar quantities and derive tensorial properties from their derivatives, our approach maintains $SO(3)$-equivariance through the use of local coordinate frames. Our GNN effectively captures geometric information by integrating scalar, vector, and tensor channels within a local message-passing framework. To assess the accuracy of our model, we apply it to predict the polarizabilities of molecules in the QM7-X dataset and show that tensorial message passing outperforms scalar message passing models. This work marks an advancement towards developing structured, geometry-aware neural models for molecular property prediction.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在变分信息瓶颈模型中，KLD和属性正则化损失的平衡是一个微妙问题：KLD主导时模型缺乏可控性，AR主导时编码器会违反标准正态先验。

Method: 研究在符号音乐生成中通过属性变换来平衡KLD和AR损失，以实现对连续音乐属性的显式控制。

Result: 现有方法难以同时最小化两个正则化目标，而合适的属性变换可以帮助实现目标潜维度的可控性和正则化。

Conclusion: 通过适当的属性变换可以解决KLD和AR损失之间的权衡问题，同时实现生成模型的可控性和潜空间的正则化。

Abstract: Explicit latent variable models provide a flexible yet powerful framework for data synthesis, enabling controlled manipulation of generative factors. With latent variables drawn from a tractable probability density function that can be further constrained, these models enable continuous and semantically rich exploration of the output space by navigating their latent spaces. Structured latent representations are typically obtained through the joint minimization of regularization loss functions. In variational information bottleneck models, reconstruction loss and Kullback-Leibler Divergence (KLD) are often linearly combined with an auxiliary Attribute-Regularization (AR) loss. However, balancing KLD and AR turns out to be a very delicate matter. When KLD dominates over AR, generative models tend to lack controllability; when AR dominates over KLD, the stochastic encoder is encouraged to violate the standard normal prior. We explore this trade-off in the context of symbolic music generation with explicit control over continuous musical attributes. We show that existing approaches struggle to jointly minimize both regularization objectives, whereas suitable attribute transformations can help achieve both controllability and regularization of the target latent dimensions.

TL;DR: REACT-LLM是一个评估LLMs与因果特征结合在临床风险预测中表现的基准测试，发现LLMs在临床预后方面表现尚可但尚未超越传统ML模型，因果特征的整合带来的性能提升有限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs和因果学习在临床决策中都有潜力，但它们的协同作用尚未被充分理解，缺乏系统性的基准测试来评估它们在临床风险预测中的整合效果。

Method: 引入REACT-LLM基准，在2个真实世界数据集上评估7个临床结局，比较15个主流LLMs、6个传统ML模型和3个因果发现算法。

Result: LLMs在临床预后方面表现合理但尚未超越传统ML模型；将因果发现算法得到的因果特征整合到LLMs中仅带来有限的性能提升，主要因为许多因果发现方法的严格假设在复杂的临床数据中经常被违反。

Conclusion: 虽然直接整合带来的改进有限，但基准测试揭示了一个更有前景的协同作用方向。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) and causal learning each hold strong potential for clinical decision making (CDM). However, their synergy remains poorly understood, largely due to the lack of systematic benchmarks evaluating their integration in clinical risk prediction. In real-world healthcare, identifying features with causal influence on outcomes is crucial for actionable and trustworthy predictions. While recent work highlights LLMs' emerging causal reasoning abilities, there lacks comprehensive benchmarks to assess their causal learning and performance informed by causal features in clinical risk prediction. To address this, we introduce REACT-LLM, a benchmark designed to evaluate whether combining LLMs with causal features can enhance clinical prognostic performance and potentially outperform traditional machine learning (ML) methods. Unlike existing LLM-clinical benchmarks that often focus on a limited set of outcomes, REACT-LLM evaluates 7 clinical outcomes across 2 real-world datasets, comparing 15 prominent LLMs, 6 traditional ML models, and 3 causal discovery (CD) algorithms. Our findings indicate that while LLMs perform reasonably in clinical prognostics, they have not yet outperformed traditional ML models. Integrating causal features derived from CD algorithms into LLMs offers limited performance gains, primarily due to the strict assumptions of many CD methods, which are often violated in complex clinical data. While the direct integration yields limited improvement, our benchmark reveals a more promising synergy.

Conclusion: 该方法首次展示了在多样化音乐属性控制方面的通用性，为符号音乐生成提供了更精确和灵活的控制手段。

Abstract: Recent advances in latent diffusion models have demonstrated state-of-the-art performance in high-dimensional time-series data synthesis while providing flexible control through conditioning and guidance. However, existing methodologies primarily rely on musical context or natural language as the main modality of interacting with the generative process, which may not be ideal for expert users who seek precise fader-like control over specific musical attributes. In this work, we explore the application of denoising diffusion processes as plug-and-play latent constraints for unconditional symbolic music generation models. We focus on a framework that leverages a library of small conditional diffusion models operating as implicit probabilistic priors on the latents of a frozen unconditional backbone. While previous studies have explored domain-specific use cases, this work, to the best of our knowledge, is the first to demonstrate the versatility of such an approach across a diverse array of musical attributes, such as note density, pitch range, contour, and rhythm complexity. Our experiments show that diffusion-driven constraints outperform traditional attribute regularization and other latent constraints architectures, achieving significantly stronger correlations between target and generated attributes while maintaining high perceptual quality and diversity.

Abstract: Discovering functional crystalline materials entails navigating an immense combinatorial design space. While recent advances in generative artificial intelligence have enabled the sampling of chemically plausible compositions and structures, a fundamental challenge remains: the objective misalignment between likelihood-based sampling in generative modelling and targeted focus on underexplored regions where novel compounds reside. Here, we introduce a reinforcement learning framework that guides latent denoising diffusion models toward diverse and novel, yet thermodynamically viable crystalline compounds. Our approach integrates group relative policy optimisation with verifiable, multi-objective rewards that jointly balance creativity, stability, and diversity. Beyond de novo generation, we demonstrate enhanced property-guided design that preserves chemical validity, while targeting desired functional properties. This approach establishes a modular foundation for controllable AI-driven inverse design that addresses the novelty-validity trade-off across scientific discovery applications of generative models.

TL;DR: LRTrend是一个可解释的机器学习框架，通过聚合多个健康和行为数据流来实时识别疾病爆发，在COVID-19 Delta和Omicron疫情期间能在爆发开始后2周内检测到区域疫情波。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 疾病爆发监测受到流行病时间序列高噪声的阻碍，而跨数据源聚合信息在其他领域显示出强大的去噪能力，但在流行病学中尚未充分探索。

Method: LRTrend框架在一个区域内有效聚合多样化的健康和行为数据流，并通过学习疾病特定的流行病网络来跨区域聚合信息。

Result: 揭示了美国各地不同的流行病集群和连接，这些连接无法用常用的人类移动网络充分解释，可能对未来的公共卫生协调具有参考价值。在305个医院转诊区域的2年COVID-19数据中，经常在疫情波开始后2周内检测到区域Delta和Omicron波，此时病例数仅为疫情波峰的一小部分。

Conclusion: LRTrend提供了一种有效的实时疫情检测方法，能够早期识别疾病爆发，为公共卫生响应提供宝贵时间窗口。

Abstract: Responding to disease outbreaks requires close surveillance of their trajectories, but outbreak detection is hindered by the high noise in epidemic time series. Aggregating information across data sources has shown great denoising ability in other fields, but remains underexplored in epidemiology. Here, we present LRTrend, an interpretable machine learning framework to identify outbreaks in real time. LRTrend effectively aggregates diverse health and behavioral data streams within one region and learns disease-specific epidemic networks to aggregate information across regions. We reveal diverse epidemic clusters and connections across the United States that are not well explained by commonly used human mobility networks and may be informative for future public health coordination. We apply LRTrend to 2 years of COVID-19 data in 305 hospital referral regions and frequently detect regional Delta and Omicron waves within 2 weeks of the outbreak's start, when case counts are a small fraction of the wave's resulting peak.

Abstract: Label learning is a fundamental task in machine learning that aims to construct intelligent models using labeled data, encompassing traditional single-label and multi-label classification models. Traditional methods typically rely on logical labels, such as binary indicators (e.g., "yes/no") that specify whether an instance belongs to a given category. However, in practical applications, label annotations often involve significant uncertainty due to factors such as data noise, inherent ambiguity in the observed entities, and the subjectivity of human annotators. Therefore, representing labels using simplistic binary logic can obscure valuable information and limit the expressiveness of label learning models. To overcome this limitation, this paper introduces the concept of fuzzy labels, grounded in fuzzy set theory, to better capture and represent label uncertainty. We further propose an efficient fuzzy labeling method that mines and generates fuzzy labels from the original data, thereby enriching the label space with more informative and nuanced representations. Based on this foundation, we present fuzzy-label-enhanced algorithms for both single-label and multi-label learning, using the classical K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and multi-label KNN algorithms as illustrative examples. Experimental results indicate that fuzzy labels can more effectively characterize the real-world labeling information and significantly enhance the performance of label learning models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的GNN模型窃取方法依赖大量查询，但现实中查询次数可能严重受限，需要开发在严格查询限制下仍能有效窃取模型的方法

Method: 首先在不直接查询受害者模型的情况下获取模型主干，然后策略性地利用固定查询限制来提取最具信息量的数据

Result: 在8个真实世界数据集上的实验表明，即使在非常严格的查询限制下以及存在模型提取防御措施时，攻击仍然有效

Conclusion: 研究结果强调了需要针对GNN模型提取威胁开发更强大的防御措施

Abstract: Current graph neural network (GNN) model-stealing methods rely heavily on queries to the victim model, assuming no hard query limits. However, in reality, the number of allowed queries can be severely limited. In this paper, we demonstrate how an adversary can extract the GNN with very limited interactions with the model. Our approach first enables the adversary to obtain the model backbone without making direct queries to the victim model and then to strategically utilize a fixed query limit to extract the most informative data. The experiments on eight real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the attack, even under a very restricted query limit and under defense against model extraction in place. Our findings underscore the need for robust defenses against GNN model extraction threats.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate impressive generalization abilities, yet adapting them effectively across multiple heterogeneous domains remains challenging due to inter-domain interference. To overcome this challenge, we propose a partition-based multi-stage fine-tuning framework designed to exploit inter-domain synergies while minimizing negative transfer. Our approach strategically partitions domains into subsets (stages) by balancing domain discrepancy, synergy, and model capacity constraints. We theoretically analyze the proposed framework and derive novel generalization bounds that justify our partitioning strategy. Extensive empirical evaluations on various language understanding tasks show that our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines.

Conclusion: SMiLE框架作为未来研究和应用的平台具有巨大潜力。

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence systems are increasingly deployed in settings where ensuring robustness, fairness, or domain-specific properties is essential for regulation compliance and alignment with human values. However, especially on Neural Networks, property enforcement is very challenging, and existing methods are limited to specific constraints or local properties (defined around datapoints), or fail to provide full guarantees. We tackle these limitations by extending SMiLE, a recently proposed enforcement framework for NNs, to support global relational properties (defined over the entire input space). The proposed approach scales well with model complexity, accommodates general properties and backbones, and provides full satisfaction guarantees. We evaluate SMiLE on monotonicity, global robustness, and individual fairness, on synthetic and real data, for regression and classification tasks. Our approach is competitive with property-specific baselines in terms of accuracy and runtime, and strictly superior in terms of generality and level of guarantees. Overall, our results emphasize the potential of the SMiLE framework as a platform for future research and applications.

Conclusion: DETECT可单独或与其他自我报告指标结合使用，帮助医生更好地理解治疗效果，实现更个性化和响应性的患者护理。

Abstract: Chronic pain is a global health challenge affecting millions of individuals, making it essential for physicians to have reliable and objective methods to measure the functional impact of clinical treatments. Traditionally used methods, like the numeric rating scale, while personalized and easy to use, are subjective due to their self-reported nature. Thus, this paper proposes DETECT (Data-Driven Evaluation of Treatments Enabled by Classification Transformers), a data-driven framework that assesses treatment success by comparing patient activities of daily life before and after treatment. We use DETECT on public benchmark datasets and simulated patient data from smartphone sensors. Our results demonstrate that DETECT is objective yet lightweight, making it a significant and novel contribution to clinical decision-making. By using DETECT, independently or together with other self-reported metrics, physicians can improve their understanding of their treatment impacts, ultimately leading to more personalized and responsive patient care.

Abstract: We propose a deep neural-operator framework for a general class of probability models. Under global Lipschitz conditions on the operator over the entire Euclidean space-and for a broad class of probabilistic models-we establish a universal approximation theorem with explicit network-size bounds for the proposed architecture. The underlying stochastic processes are required only to satisfy integrability and general tail-probability conditions. We verify these assumptions for both European and American option-pricing problems within the forward-backward SDE (FBSDE) framework, which in turn covers a broad class of operators arising from parabolic PDEs, with or without free boundaries. Finally, we present a numerical example for a basket of American options, demonstrating that the learned model produces optimal stopping boundaries for new strike prices without retraining.

Abstract: Causal discovery is fundamental for multiple scientific domains, yet extracting causal information from real world data remains a significant challenge. Given the recent success on real data, we investigate whether TabPFN, a transformer-based tabular foundation model pre-trained on synthetic datasets generated from structural causal models, encodes causal information in its internal representations. We develop an adapter framework using a learnable decoder and causal tokens that extract causal signals from TabPFN's frozen embeddings and decode them into adjacency matrices for causal discovery. Our evaluations demonstrate that TabPFN's embeddings contain causal information, outperforming several traditional causal discovery algorithms, with such causal information being concentrated in mid-range layers. These findings establish a new direction for interpretable and adaptable foundation models and demonstrate the potential for leveraging pre-trained tabular models for causal discovery.

Abstract: Large-scale models are at the forefront of time series (TS) forecasting, dominated by two paradigms: fine-tuning text-based Large Language Models (LLM4TS) and training Time Series Foundation Models (TSFMs) from scratch. Both approaches share a foundational assumption that scaling up model capacity and data volume leads to improved performance. However, we observe a \textit{\textbf{scaling paradox}} in TS models, revealing a puzzling phenomenon that larger models do \emph{NOT} achieve better performance. Through extensive experiments on two model families across four scales (100M to 1.7B parameters) and diverse data (up to 6B observations), we rigorously confirm that the scaling paradox is a pervasive issue. We then diagnose its root cause by analyzing internal representations, identifying a phenomenon we call \textit{few-layer dominance}: only a small subset of layers are functionally important, while the majority are redundant, under-utilized, and can even distract training. Based on this discovery, we propose a practical method to automatically identify and retain only these dominant layers. In our models, retaining only 21\% of the parameters achieves up to a 12\% accuracy improvement and a 2.7$\times$ inference speedup. We validate the universality of our method on 8 prominent SOTA models (LLM4TS and TSFMs, 90M to 6B), showing that retaining less than 30\% of layers achieves comparable or superior accuracy in over 95\% of tasks.

Abstract: Overparameterized fully-connected neural networks have been shown to behave like kernel models when trained with gradient descent, under mild conditions on the width, the learning rate, and the parameter initialization. In the limit of infinitely large widths and small learning rate, the kernel that is obtained allows to represent the output of the learned model with a closed-form solution. This closed-form solution hinges on the invertibility of the limiting kernel, a property that often holds on real-world datasets. In this work, we analyze the sensitivity of large ReLU networks to increasing depths by characterizing the corresponding limiting kernel. Our theoretical results demonstrate that the normalized limiting kernel approaches the matrix of ones. In contrast, they show the corresponding closed-form solution approaches a fixed limit on the sphere. We empirically evaluate the order of magnitude in network depth required to observe this convergent behavior, and we describe the essential properties that enable the generalization of our results to other kernels.

Abstract: Multiple clustering aims to discover diverse latent structures from different perspectives, yet existing methods generate exhaustive clusterings without discerning user interest, necessitating laborious manual screening. Current multi-modal solutions suffer from static semantic rigidity: predefined candidate words fail to adapt to dataset-specific concepts, and fixed fusion strategies ignore evolving feature interactions. To overcome these limitations, we propose Multi-DProxy, a novel multi-modal dynamic proxy learning framework that leverages cross-modal alignment through learnable textual proxies. Multi-DProxy introduces 1) gated cross-modal fusion that synthesizes discriminative joint representations by adaptively modeling feature interactions. 2) dual-constraint proxy optimization where user interest constraints enforce semantic consistency with domain concepts while concept constraints employ hard example mining to enhance cluster discrimination. 3) dynamic candidate management that refines textual proxies through iterative clustering feedback. Therefore, Multi-DProxy not only effectively captures a user's interest through proxies but also enables the identification of relevant clusterings with greater precision. Extensive experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance with significant improvements over existing methods across a broad set of multi-clustering benchmarks.

Abstract: In recent years, multimodal anomaly detection methods have demonstrated remarkable performance improvements over video-only models. However, real-world multimodal data is often corrupted due to unforeseen environmental distortions. In this paper, we present the first-of-its-kind work that comprehensively investigates the adverse effects of corrupted modalities on multimodal anomaly detection task. To streamline this work, we propose RobustA, a carefully curated evaluation dataset to systematically observe the impacts of audio and visual corruptions on the overall effectiveness of anomaly detection systems. Furthermore, we propose a multimodal anomaly detection method, which shows notable resilience against corrupted modalities. The proposed method learns a shared representation space for different modalities and employs a dynamic weighting scheme during inference based on the estimated level of corruption. Our work represents a significant step forward in enabling the real-world application of multimodal anomaly detection, addressing situations where the likely events of modality corruptions occur. The proposed evaluation dataset with corrupted modalities and respective extracted features will be made publicly available.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新颖的多图异构GNN框架(MG-HGNN)，通过多类型任务导向的图构建和异构GNN结构来增强Wi-Fi指纹定位的精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的RSSI定位方法由于环境复杂性和多源信息处理困难导致精度下降，需要增强空间感知能力来改善定位性能。

Method: 使用两个图构建分支分别进行节点和边嵌入来生成信息丰富的图，然后采用异构图神经网络进行图表示学习，实现精确定位。

Result: 在UJIIndoorLoc和UTSIndoorLoc公开数据集上的评估表明，MG-HGNN相比多种最先进方法具有更优越的性能。

Conclusion: 该框架不仅实现了更好的定位性能，还为增强基于GNN的定位方法提供了新视角，消融研究进一步证实了框架的合理性和有效性。

Abstract: Received signal strength indicator (RSSI) is the primary representation of Wi-Fi fingerprints and serves as a crucial tool for indoor localization. However, existing RSSI-based positioning methods often suffer from reduced accuracy due to environmental complexity and challenges in processing multi-source information. To address these issues, we propose a novel multi-graph heterogeneous GNN framework (MG-HGNN) to enhance spatial awareness and improve positioning performance. In this framework, two graph construction branches perform node and edge embedding, respectively, to generate informative graphs. Subsequently, a heterogeneous graph neural network is employed for graph representation learning, enabling accurate positioning. The MG-HGNN framework introduces the following key innovations: 1) multi-type task-directed graph construction that combines label estimation and feature encoding for richer graph information; 2) a heterogeneous GNN structure that enhances the performance of conventional GNN models. Evaluations on the UJIIndoorLoc and UTSIndoorLoc public datasets demonstrate that MG-HGNN not only achieves superior performance compared to several state-of-the-art methods, but also provides a novel perspective for enhancing GNN-based localization methods. Ablation studies further confirm the rationality and effectiveness of the proposed framework.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 强化学习训练复杂策略时存在不稳定和收敛慢的问题，而最先进的模仿学习方法如GAIL由于基于on-policy算法导致样本效率低下

Method: 将离策略学习框架与双Q网络稳定化技术、无需奖励函数推断的价值学习相结合

Result: 显著减少了匹配专家行为所需的样本数量

Conclusion: 离策略学习可以有效提升对抗模仿学习的样本效率

Abstract: Learning complex policies with Reinforcement Learning (RL) is often hindered by instability and slow convergence, a problem exacerbated by the difficulty of reward engineering. Imitation Learning (IL) from expert demonstrations bypasses this reliance on rewards. However, state-of-the-art IL methods, exemplified by Generative Adversarial Imitation Learning (GAIL)Ho et. al, suffer from severe sample inefficiency. This is a direct consequence of their foundational on-policy algorithms, such as TRPO Schulman et.al. In this work, we introduce an adversarial imitation learning algorithm that incorporates off-policy learning to improve sample efficiency. By combining an off-policy framework with auxiliary techniques specifically, double Q network based stabilization and value learning without reward function inference we demonstrate a reduction in the samples required to robustly match expert behavior.

Conclusion: 该框架为解释训练动态提供了原则性基础，可能指导未来在超参数调整和学习率调度器设计方面的工作。

Abstract: Understanding the training dynamics of deep neural networks remains a major open problem, with physics-inspired approaches offering promising insights. Building on this perspective, we develop a thermodynamic framework to describe the stationary distributions of stochastic gradient descent (SGD) with weight decay for scale-invariant neural networks, a setting that both reflects practical architectures with normalization layers and permits theoretical analysis. We establish analogies between training hyperparameters (e.g., learning rate, weight decay) and thermodynamic variables such as temperature, pressure, and volume. Starting with a simplified isotropic noise model, we uncover a close correspondence between SGD dynamics and ideal gas behavior, validated through theory and simulation. Extending to training of neural networks, we show that key predictions of the framework, including the behavior of stationary entropy, align closely with experimental observations. This framework provides a principled foundation for interpreting training dynamics and may guide future work on hyperparameter tuning and the design of learning rate schedulers.

Motivation: Stratego作为具有大量隐藏信息的战略决策游戏，此前的人工智能训练需要数百万美元成本却未能达到顶级人类水平，这促使研究者寻找更高效的解决方案。

Method: 开发了不完全信息下的自博弈强化学习和测试时搜索的通用方法。

Result: 在Stratego游戏中实现了远超人类水平的性能，且训练成本大幅降低至数千美元。

Conclusion: 证明了通过创新的自博弈强化学习和搜索方法，可以在不完全信息游戏中以较低成本实现超人类性能。

Abstract: Few classical games have been regarded as such significant benchmarks of artificial intelligence as to have justified training costs in the millions of dollars. Among these, Stratego -- a board wargame exemplifying the challenge of strategic decision making under massive amounts of hidden information -- stands apart as a case where such efforts failed to produce performance at the level of top humans. This work establishes a step change in both performance and cost for Stratego, showing that it is now possible not only to reach the level of top humans, but to achieve vastly superhuman level -- and that doing so requires not an industrial budget, but merely a few thousand dollars. We achieved this result by developing general approaches for self-play reinforcement learning and test-time search under imperfect information.

Conclusion: Q-RAG为多步检索提供了竞争性强且资源高效的解决方案，在长上下文问答任务中表现优异。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) methods enhance LLM performance by efficiently filtering relevant context for LLMs, reducing hallucinations and inference cost. However, most existing RAG methods focus on single-step retrieval, which is often insufficient for answering complex questions that require multi-step search. Recently, multi-step retrieval approaches have emerged, typically involving the fine-tuning of small LLMs to perform multi-step retrieval. This type of fine-tuning is highly resource-intensive and does not enable the use of larger LLMs. In this work, we propose Q-RAG, a novel approach that fine-tunes the Embedder model for multi-step retrieval using reinforcement learning (RL). Q-RAG offers a competitive, resource-efficient alternative to existing multi-step retrieval methods for open-domain question answering and achieves state-of-the-art results on the popular long-context benchmarks Babilong and RULER for contexts up to 10M tokens.

Training utilizes PyTorch, Automatic Mixed Precision (AMP), and gradient checkpointing and is carried out on the CIFAR-10 dataset for five epochs. The outcomes show that fractal-based architectures are capable of strong performance and are computationally efficient. The paper positions fractal design as a feasible and resource-efficient method of automated architecture exploration.

Result: GroundNext在3B和7B规模下，在五个基准测试中均达到最先进水平，且所需训练数据不到先前工作的十分之一。在OSWorld基准测试中，使用o3作为规划器时，性能与使用更多数据训练的模型相当或更优。

Conclusion: 高质量、专家驱动的数据集在推进通用计算机使用代理方面发挥着关键作用。

Abstract: Building reliable computer-use agents requires grounding: accurately connecting natural language instructions to the correct on-screen elements. While large datasets exist for web and mobile interactions, high-quality resources for desktop environments are limited. To address this gap, we introduce GroundCUA, a large-scale desktop grounding dataset built from expert human demonstrations. It covers 87 applications across 12 categories and includes 56K screenshots, with every on-screen element carefully annotated for a total of over 3.56M human-verified annotations. From these demonstrations, we generate diverse instructions that capture a wide range of real-world tasks, providing high-quality data for model training. Using GroundCUA, we develop the GroundNext family of models that map instructions to their target UI elements. At both 3B and 7B scales, GroundNext achieves state-of-the-art results across five benchmarks using supervised fine-tuning, while requiring less than one-tenth the training data of prior work. Reinforcement learning post-training further improves performance, and when evaluated in an agentic setting on the OSWorld benchmark using o3 as planner, GroundNext attains comparable or superior results to models trained with substantially more data,. These results demonstrate the critical role of high-quality, expert-driven datasets in advancing general-purpose computer-use agents.

TL;DR: TNT是一种新的训练范式，通过两阶段过程解决深度测试时记忆RNN训练效率低的问题：第一阶段使用分层内存进行高效预训练，第二阶段进行简短微调，在提升17倍训练速度的同时提高模型精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的深度测试时记忆RNN（如Titans和TTT）虽然具有线性扩展潜力，但由于训练速度极慢和硬件利用率低，其潜力未被充分挖掘。现有并行化方法在速度和性能之间存在根本冲突。

Method: 提出TNT两阶段训练范式：第一阶段使用分层内存进行效率优先的预训练，全局模块处理大块上下文，并行本地模块处理细节，通过定期重置本地内存状态打破序列依赖；第二阶段仅对本地内存模块进行小规模高分辨率微调。

Result: 在Titans和TTT模型上评估，TNT实现了高达17倍的训练加速，同时提高了模型精度，突破了RNN的可扩展性瓶颈。

Conclusion: TNT为开发表达性RNN建立了实用基础，有助于未来工作缩小与Transformer的性能差距。

Abstract: Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) with deep test-time memorization modules, such as Titans and TTT, represent a promising, linearly-scaling paradigm distinct from Transformers. While these expressive models do not yet match the peak performance of state-of-the-art Transformers, their potential has been largely untapped due to prohibitively slow training and low hardware utilization. Existing parallelization methods force a fundamental conflict governed by the chunksize hyperparameter: large chunks boost speed but degrade performance, necessitating a fixed, suboptimal compromise. To solve this challenge, we introduce TNT, a novel training paradigm that decouples training efficiency from inference performance through a two-stage process. Stage one is an efficiency-focused pre-training phase utilizing a hierarchical memory. A global module processes large, hardware-friendly chunks for long-range context, while multiple parallel local modules handle fine-grained details. Crucially, by periodically resetting local memory states, we break sequential dependencies to enable massive context parallelization. Stage two is a brief fine-tuning phase where only the local memory modules are adapted to a smaller, high-resolution chunksize, maximizing accuracy with minimal overhead. Evaluated on Titans and TTT models, TNT achieves a substantial acceleration in training speed-up to 17 times faster than the most accurate baseline configuration - while simultaneously improving model accuracy. This improvement removes a critical scalability barrier, establishing a practical foundation for developing expressive RNNs and facilitating future work to close the performance gap with Transformers.

Motivation: 大型语言模型在多步推理任务中的可靠性和错误检测对其在高风险场景中的部署至关重要。现有研究主要关注单步输出的置信度估计，而忽视了多步推理的特殊挑战。

Method: 将自评估技术扩展到多步任务，测试了两种直观方法：整体评分和逐步评分，并在两个多步基准数据集上进行验证。

Result: 逐步评估方法在检测潜在错误方面普遍优于整体评分，AUC-ROC相对提升高达15%。自评估LLM系统能够为复杂推理提供有意义的置信度估计。

Conclusion: 自评估LLM系统能够提高复杂推理任务的可信度，为失败检测提供了实用框架，增强了多步推理场景下模型部署的可靠性。

Abstract: Reliability and failure detection of large language models (LLMs) is critical for their deployment in high-stakes, multi-step reasoning tasks. Prior work explores confidence estimation for self-evaluating LLM-scorer systems, with confidence scorers estimating the likelihood of errors in LLM responses. However, most methods focus on single-step outputs and overlook the challenges of multi-step reasoning. In this work, we extend self-evaluation techniques to multi-step tasks, testing two intuitive approaches: holistic scoring and step-by-step scoring. Using two multi-step benchmark datasets, we show that stepwise evaluation generally outperforms holistic scoring in detecting potential errors, with up to 15% relative increase in AUC-ROC. Our findings demonstrate that self-evaluating LLM systems provide meaningful confidence estimates in complex reasoning, improving their trustworthiness and providing a practical framework for failure detection.

Motivation: 线性回归广泛应用于各领域，但涉及敏感数据时需保护隐私。现有差分私有方法通常估计带噪声的参数向量，作者提出发布数据集的私有草图来改进这一方法。

Method: 开发差分私有草图方法，针对最小二乘回归和最小绝对偏差回归问题，通过生成私有数据摘要而非直接添加噪声到参数估计中。

Conclusion: 差分私有草图方法为敏感数据的线性回归分析提供了有效且实用的隐私保护解决方案，优于传统的噪声参数估计方法。

Abstract: Linear regression is frequently applied in a variety of domains. In order to improve the efficiency of these methods, various methods have been developed that compute summaries or \emph{sketches} of the datasets. Certain domains, however, contain sensitive data which necessitates that the application of these statistical methods does not reveal private information. Differentially private (DP) linear regression methods have been developed for mitigating this problem. These techniques typically involve estimating a noisy version of the parameter vector. Instead, we propose releasing private sketches of the datasets. We present differentially private sketches for the problems of least squares regression, as well as least absolute deviations regression. The availability of these private sketches facilitates the application of commonly available solvers for regression, without the risk of privacy leakage.

TL;DR: 本文通过多任务树状马尔可夫链模型解释了后训练中的探索悖论：虽然RLVR和ORM/PRM主要强化已有推理路径，但探索仍至关重要，因为它保留了解决困难问题所需的罕见推理路径。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基础模型具有广泛知识但任务特定推理能力有限，后训练策略如RLVR和推理缩放存在一个悖论：它们主要强化已有推理路径而非扩展推理范围，但探索却仍能提升性能。

Method: 采用多任务树状马尔可夫链模型，将预训练视为树扩展，后训练视为思维链重加权，分析后训练动态。

Result: 理论分析显示：(1)RLVR产生挤压效应，减少推理熵并遗忘某些正确路径；(2)ORM/PRM鼓励一致性而非准确性；(3)基础模型的罕见高不确定性推理路径负责解决困难问题。

Conclusion: 探索之所以重要，是因为它保留了解决困难问题所需的罕见推理路径，这些路径会被RLVR挤压或被推理缩放忽略。拒绝简单实例和KL正则化等探索策略有助于保护这些罕见推理路径。

Abstract: Foundation models exhibit broad knowledge but limited task-specific reasoning, motivating post-training strategies such as RLVR and inference scaling with outcome or process reward models (ORM/PRM). While recent work highlights the role of exploration and entropy stability in improving pass@K, empirical evidence points to a paradox: RLVR and ORM/PRM typically reinforce existing tree-like reasoning paths rather than expanding the reasoning scope, raising the question of why exploration helps at all if no new patterns emerge.
  To reconcile this paradox, we adopt the perspective of Kim et al. (2025), viewing easy (e.g., simplifying a fraction) versus hard (e.g., discovering a symmetry) reasoning steps as low- versus high-probability Markov transitions, and formalize post-training dynamics through Multi-task Tree-structured Markov Chains (TMC). In this tractable model, pretraining corresponds to tree expansion, while post-training corresponds to chain-of-thought reweighting. We show that several phenomena recently observed in empirical studies arise naturally in this setting: (1) RLVR induces a squeezing effect, reducing reasoning entropy and forgetting some correct paths; (2) population rewards of ORM/PRM encourage consistency rather than accuracy, thereby favoring common patterns; and (3) certain rare, high-uncertainty reasoning paths by the base model are responsible for solving hard problem instances.
  Together, these explain why exploration -- even when confined to the base model's reasoning scope -- remains essential: it preserves access to rare but crucial reasoning traces needed for difficult cases, which are squeezed out by RLVR or unfavored by inference scaling. Building on this, we further show that exploration strategies such as rejecting easy instances and KL regularization help preserve rare reasoning traces. Empirical simulations corroborate our theoretical results.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前观察到课程学习技术在LLM后训练阶段能显著提升推理性能，但其工作原理和有效范围缺乏理论理解，需要建立理论框架来解释为什么以及什么条件下课程学习有效。

Method: 基于CoT解决数学问题的洞察，将CoT生成建模为状态条件自回归推理树，定义均匀分支基础模型来捕捉预训练行为，并将课程阶段形式化为深度增加（更长推理链）或提示减少（更短前缀）的子任务。

Result: 分析表明，在仅结果奖励信号下，强化学习微调能以多项式样本复杂度实现高准确率，而直接学习则面临指数级瓶颈。测试时扩展也显示课程感知查询将奖励oracle调用和采样成本从指数级降至多项式级。

Conclusion: 课程学习通过渐进式学习可管理步骤，在模型有效能力范围内避免了指数级复杂度瓶颈，为课程学习在LLM推理增强中的有效性提供了理论保证。

Abstract: Recent curriculum techniques in the post-training stage of LLMs have been widely observed to outperform non-curriculum approaches in enhancing reasoning performance, yet a principled understanding of why and to what extent they work remains elusive. To address this gap, we develop a theoretical framework grounded in the intuition that progressively learning through manageable steps is more efficient than directly tackling a hard reasoning task, provided each stage stays within the model's effective competence. Under mild complexity conditions linking consecutive curriculum stages, we show that curriculum post-training avoids the exponential complexity bottleneck.
  To substantiate this result, drawing insights from the Chain-of-Thoughts (CoTs) solving mathematical problems such as Countdown and parity, we model CoT generation as a states-conditioned autoregressive reasoning tree, define a uniform-branching base model to capture pretrained behavior, and formalize curriculum stages as either depth-increasing (longer reasoning chains) or hint-decreasing (shorter prefixes) subtasks. Our analysis shows that, under outcome-only reward signals, reinforcement learning finetuning achieves high accuracy with polynomial sample complexity, whereas direct learning suffers from an exponential bottleneck. We further establish analogous guarantees for test-time scaling, where curriculum-aware querying reduces both reward oracle calls and sampling cost from exponential to polynomial order.

Conclusion: Transformer通过注意力集中机制能够实现状态跟踪任务中的长度泛化，递归自训练可以渐进扩展可解决问题的长度范围，为Transformer学习复杂推理任务提供了理论保证。

Abstract: The ability to reason lies at the core of artificial intelligence (AI), and challenging problems usually call for deeper and longer reasoning to tackle. A crucial question about AI reasoning is whether models can extrapolate learned reasoning patterns to solve harder tasks with longer chain-of-thought (CoT). In this work, we present a theoretical analysis of transformers learning on synthetic state-tracking tasks with gradient descent. We mathematically prove how the algebraic structure of state-tracking problems governs the degree of extrapolation of the learned CoT. Specifically, our theory characterizes the length generalization of transformers through the mechanism of attention concentration, linking the retrieval robustness of the attention layer to the state-tracking task structure of long-context reasoning. Moreover, for transformers with limited reasoning length, we prove that a recursive self-training scheme can progressively extend the range of solvable problem lengths. To our knowledge, we provide the first optimization guarantee that constant-depth transformers provably learn $\mathsf{NC}^1$-complete problems with CoT, significantly going beyond prior art confined in $\mathsf{TC}^0$, unless the widely held conjecture $\mathsf{TC}^0 \neq \mathsf{NC}^1$ fails. Finally, we present a broad set of experiments supporting our theoretical results, confirming the length generalization behaviors and the mechanism of attention concentration.

Conclusion: LoReTTA证明了时序图神经网络对中毒攻击的严重脆弱性，为评估和改进TGNN安全性提供了重要基准，其有效性、不可检测性和鲁棒性确立了其作为强大攻击方法的地位。

Abstract: Temporal Graph Neural Networks (TGNNs) are increasingly used in high-stakes domains, such as financial forecasting, recommendation systems, and fraud detection. However, their susceptibility to poisoning attacks poses a critical security risk. We introduce LoReTTA (Low Resource Two-phase Temporal Attack), a novel adversarial framework on Continuous-Time Dynamic Graphs, which degrades TGNN performance by an average of 29.47% across 4 widely benchmark datasets and 4 State-of-the-Art (SotA) models. LoReTTA operates through a two-stage approach: (1) sparsify the graph by removing high-impact edges using any of the 16 tested temporal importance metrics, (2) strategically replace removed edges with adversarial negatives via LoReTTA's novel degree-preserving negative sampling algorithm. Our plug-and-play design eliminates the need for expensive surrogate models while adhering to realistic unnoticeability constraints. LoReTTA degrades performance by upto 42.0% on MOOC, 31.5% on Wikipedia, 28.8% on UCI, and 15.6% on Enron. LoReTTA outperforms 11 attack baselines, remains undetectable to 4 leading anomaly detection systems, and is robust to 4 SotA adversarial defense training methods, establishing its effectiveness, unnoticeability, and robustness.

TL;DR: SCISOR是一种新颖的离散扩散模型，通过删除序列中的字母来生成类似自然蛋白质的缩短版本，在蛋白质缩短任务中表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 许多在医学和生物工程中有用的蛋白质序列过长，难以在实验室中制造、融合或递送，而传统的缩短方法成本高且耗时。

Method: 提出SCISOR离散扩散模型，训练去噪器来逆转在自然序列中添加随机插入的前向噪声过程，从而学习如何删除序列元素。

Result: SCISOR在ProteinGym上实现了最先进的删除功能效应预测，其建议的删除能产生更真实的蛋白质并更好地保留功能基序。

Conclusion: SCISOR为蛋白质缩短提供了一种有效的方法，能够生成更自然、功能保留更好的缩短蛋白质序列。

Abstract: Many proteins useful in modern medicine or bioengineering are challenging to make in the lab, fuse with other proteins in cells, or deliver to tissues in the body, because their sequences are too long. Shortening these sequences typically involves costly, time-consuming experimental campaigns. Ideally, we could instead use modern models of massive databases of sequences from nature to learn how to propose shrunken proteins that resemble sequences found in nature. Unfortunately, these models struggle to efficiently search the combinatorial space of all deletions, and are not trained with inductive biases to learn how to delete. To address this gap, we propose SCISOR, a novel discrete diffusion model that deletes letters from sequences to generate protein samples that resemble those found in nature. To do so, SCISOR trains a de-noiser to reverse a forward noising process that adds random insertions to natural sequences. As a generative model, SCISOR fits evolutionary sequence data competitively with previous large models. In evaluation, SCISOR achieves state-of-the-art predictions of the functional effects of deletions on ProteinGym. Finally, we use the SCISOR de-noiser to shrink long protein sequences, and show that its suggested deletions result in significantly more realistic proteins and more often preserve functional motifs than previous models of evolutionary sequences.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在复杂推理任务上表现出色，但高推理成本限制了实际部署。现有级联方法需要监督训练，缺乏理论保证，且成本控制有限。

Method: 提出C3PO框架，基于最强大模型的最小化后悔原则，使用无标签模型输出构建级联，通过保形预测约束推理成本不超过用户预算。

Result: 在GSM8K、MATH-500、BigBench-Hard和AIME等多个推理基准上，C3PO在准确性和成本效率方面均优于现有级联基线方法。

Conclusion: 基于原则的无标签级联优化能够实现可扩展的LLM部署，为实际应用提供了理论保证和实用解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved impressive results on complex reasoning tasks, but their high inference cost remains a major barrier to real-world deployment. A promising solution is to use cascaded inference, where small, cheap models handle easy queries, and only the hardest examples are escalated to more powerful models. However, existing cascade methods typically rely on supervised training with labeled data, offer no theoretical generalization guarantees, and provide limited control over test-time computational cost. We introduce C3PO (Cost Controlled Cascaded Prediction Optimization), a self-supervised framework for optimizing LLM cascades under probabilistic cost constraints. By focusing on minimizing regret with respect to the most powerful model (MPM), C3PO avoids the need for labeled data by constructing a cascade using only unlabeled model outputs. It leverages conformal prediction to bound the probability that inference cost exceeds a user-specified budget. We provide theoretical guarantees on both cost control and generalization error, and show that our optimization procedure is effective even with small calibration sets. Empirically, C3PO achieves state-of-the-art performance across a diverse set of reasoning benchmarks including GSM8K, MATH-500, BigBench-Hard and AIME, outperforming strong LLM cascading baselines in both accuracy and cost-efficiency. Our results demonstrate that principled, label-free cascade optimization can enable scalable LLM deployment.

Result: 该框架能准确模拟扰动下的异质细胞群体和高维生物分子系统中的稀有跃迁。

Conclusion: EntangledSBM填补了现有方法无法捕捉动态相互作用的空白，为复杂能量景观上的多粒子系统模拟提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Simulating trajectories of multi-particle systems on complex energy landscapes is a central task in molecular dynamics (MD) and drug discovery, but remains challenging at scale due to computationally expensive and long simulations. Previous approaches leverage techniques such as flow or Schrödinger bridge matching to implicitly learn joint trajectories through data snapshots. However, many systems, including biomolecular systems and heterogeneous cell populations, undergo dynamic interactions that evolve over their trajectory and cannot be captured through static snapshots. To close this gap, we introduce Entangled Schrödinger Bridge Matching (EntangledSBM), a framework that learns the first- and second-order stochastic dynamics of interacting, multi-particle systems where the direction and magnitude of each particle's path depend dynamically on the paths of the other particles. We define the Entangled Schrödinger Bridge (EntangledSB) problem as solving a coupled system of bias forces that entangle particle velocities. We show that our framework accurately simulates heterogeneous cell populations under perturbations and rare transitions in high-dimensional biomolecular systems.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出RoMA方法，通过路由流形对齐来改善MoE大语言模型的路由性能，仅需轻量级微调路由器参数，在多个MoE模型上显著提升泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MoE大语言模型的路由器在下游任务中表现不佳，与最优路由存在10-20%的性能差距，需要改进路由机制以提升模型泛化能力。

Method: RoMA方法在训练目标中引入流形正则化项，鼓励样本的路由权重在任务嵌入空间中接近其成功邻居的路由权重，使相似任务的样本在不同层共享相似的专家选择。

Result: 在OLMoE、DeepSeekMoE和Qwen3-MoE等模型上实验表明，RoMA方法在多样化基准测试中带来显著改进，与基线相比性能大幅提升。

Conclusion: RoMA展示了将任务理解（通过嵌入模型）与解决方案生成（通过MoE LLMs）统一起来的优势，有效缩小了路由性能差距并改善了MoE模型的泛化能力。

Abstract: Sparse Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) have been widely adopted in recent large language models since it can efficiently scale up the model capability without increasing the inference cost. However, evaluations on broad downstream tasks reveal a consistent suboptimality of the routers in existing MoE LLMs, which results in a severe performance gap (e.g., 10-20% in accuracy) to the optimal routing. In this paper, we show that aligning the manifold of routing weights with that of task embedding can effectively reduce the gap and improve MoE LLMs' generalization performance. Our method, "Routing Manifold Alignment (RoMA)", introduces an additional manifold regularization term in the post-training objective and only requires lightweight finetuning of routers (with other parameters frozen). Specifically, the regularization encourages the routing weights of each sample to be close to those of its successful neighbors (whose routing weights lead to correct answers) in a task embedding space. Consequently, samples targeting similar tasks will share similar expert choices across layers. Building such bindings between tasks and experts over different samples is essential to achieve better generalization. Moreover, RoMA demonstrates the advantage of unifying the task understanding (by embedding models) with solution generation (by MoE LLMs). In experiments, we finetune routers in OLMoE, DeepSeekMoE, and Qwen3-MoE using RoMA. Evaluations on diverse benchmarks and extensive comparisons with baselines show the substantial improvement brought by RoMA.

Conclusion: DWM-RO框架通过世界模型和选择性边缘协调，有效解决了多智能体在复杂无线网络环境中的样本效率低和协调差的问题，实现了显著性能提升和鲁棒性增强。

Abstract: Wireless networks are undergoing a paradigm shift toward massive connectivity with energy-efficient operation, driving the integration of satellite-terrestrial architectures with simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT). Optimizing transmit beamforming and power splitting in such systems faces formidable challenges, e.g., time-varying channels and multi-tier interference, which create a complex decision landscape where conventional model-free multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) suffers from sample inefficiency due to rarely-encountered state transitions and poor coordination as decentralized agents act independently. This paper proposes the Decentralized World Model with Reasoning Offloading (DWM-RO) framework to address these fundamental limitations. Specifically, each agent employs a world model to learn compact predictive representations of environment dynamics, enabling imagination-based policy training that dramatically reduces required environment interactions. An uncertainty-aware offloading gate monitors local interference levels and model reconstruction errors to trigger selective edge coordination. When activated, a lightweight latent decorrelation mechanism at the edge refines agents' strategic representations, guiding them toward orthogonal actions that minimize resource conflicts. Extensive simulations demonstrate that DWM-RO converges 5 times faster than state-of-the-art baselines while achieving 34.7% higher spectral efficiency and reducing constraint violations by 40%. In dense network scenarios with 10 users, DWM-RO maintains violation rates below 20% while baselines exceed 70%, validating superior robustness.

Motivation: 科学计算应用严重依赖多维数组的多级循环嵌套，但编译器低层表示难以分析跨步数据访问和循环携带依赖等常见模式，限制了并行化和数据移动优化的潜力。

Method: 引入符号归纳循环优化(SILO)，将数据访问和依赖关系建模为循环步长的函数，实现自动并行化、软件预取和指针递增优化以减少寄存器溢出。

Result: 在科学应用的基础内核上，特别是大气模型和数值求解器，相比现有技术实现了高达12倍的加速。

Conclusion: SILO通过高级抽象有效解决了编译器在分析复杂循环模式时的局限性，显著提升了科学计算应用的性能。

Abstract: Scientific computing applications heavily rely on multi-level loop nests operating on multidimensional arrays. This presents multiple optimization opportunities from exploiting parallelism to reducing data movement through prefetching and improved register usage. HPC frameworks often delegate fine-grained data movement optimization to compilers, but their low-level representations hamper analysis of common patterns, such as strided data accesses and loop-carried dependencies. In this paper, we introduce symbolic, inductive loop optimization (SILO), a novel technique that models data accesses and dependencies as functions of loop nest strides. This abstraction enables the automatic parallelization of sequentially-dependent loops, as well as data movement optimizations including software prefetching and pointer incrementation to reduce register spills. We demonstrate SILO on fundamental kernels from scientific applications with a focus on atmospheric models and numerical solvers, achieving up to 12$\times$ speedup over the state of the art.

Conclusion: 碳预测解决方案无需高度精确和复杂的预测即可实现大部分节省，关键在于保持预测相对于真实值的排名，LiteCast为此提供了高效实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Over recent decades, electricity demand has experienced sustained growth through widespread electrification of transportation and the accelerated expansion of Artificial Intelligence (AI). Grids have managed the resulting surges by scaling generation capacity, incorporating additional resources such as solar and wind, and implementing demand-response mechanisms. Altogether, these policies influence a region's carbon intensity by affecting its energy mix. To mitigate the environmental impacts of consumption, carbon-aware optimizations often rely on long-horizon, high-accuracy forecasts of the grid's carbon intensity that typically use compute intensive models with extensive historical energy mix data. In addition to limiting scalability, accuracy improvements do not necessarily translate into proportional increases in savings. Highlighting the need for more efficient forecasting strategies, we argue that carbon forecasting solutions can achieve the majority of savings without requiring highly precise and complex predictions. Instead, it is the preservation of the ranking of forecasts relative to the ground-truth that drives realized savings. In this paper, we present LiteCast, a lightweight time series forecasting method capable of quickly modeling a region's energy mix to estimate its carbon intensity. LiteCast requires only a few days of historical energy and weather data, delivering fast forecasts that can quickly adapt to sudden changes in the electrical grid. Our evaluation in 50 worldwide regions under various real-world workloads shows that LiteCast outperforms state-of-the-art forecasters, delivering 20% higher savings with near-optimal performance, achieving 97% of the maximum attainable average savings, while remaining lightweight, efficient to run, and adaptive to new data.

Conclusion: CDSP和Tetris系统通过细粒度的序列并行策略有效解决了LLM推理中的并行化挑战，显著提升了服务效率和资源利用率。

Abstract: With the advancement of large language models (LLMs), their context windows have rapidly expanded. To meet diverse demands from varying-length requests in online services, existing state-of-the-art systems tune the sequence parallelism (SP) allocation. However, current dynamic SP allocation lacks flexibility to (1) support stage-specific parallelism requirements in LLM inference, (2) mitigate the global latency degradation from excessive SP allocation, and (3) exploit resource fragments arising from SP size variation.
  To tackle this problem, we propose Chunkwise Dynamic Sequence Parallelism (CDSP), a fine-grained parallelism strategy that assigns SP sizes across \textit{intra-request} token segments. Based on CDSP, we build Tetris, an LLM serving system that (1) efficiently integrates CDSP into disaggregated cluster to satisfy parallelism heterogeneity, (2) dynamically regulates SP size expansion based on real-time load conditions, and (3) adaptively explores chunking plans to utilize fragmented resources while meeting per-request demands. Compared with state-of-the-art systems, Tetris achieves up to 4.35$\times$ lower time-to-first-token (TTFT) under max sustainable loads, reduces median time-between-tokens (TBT) by up to 40.1\%, and increases the max request capacity by up to 45\%.

Abstract: Designing high-performance kernels requires expert-level tuning and a deep understanding of hardware characteristics. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled automated kernel generation, yet most existing systems rely solely on correctness or execution time feedback, lacking the ability to reason about low-level performance bottlenecks. In this paper, we introduce PRAGMA, a profile-guided AI kernel generation framework that integrates execution feedback and fine-grained hardware profiling into the reasoning loop. PRAGMA enables LLMs to identify performance bottlenecks, preserve historical best versions, and iteratively refine code quality. We evaluate PRAGMA on KernelBench, covering GPU and CPU backends. Results show that PRAGMA consistently outperforms baseline AIKG without profiling enabled and achieves 2.81$\times$ and 2.30$\times$ averaged speedups against Torch on CPU and GPU platforms, respectively.

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: Saarthi是一个端到端的无服务器框架，通过输入感知的智能资源管理和多目标优化，解决了FaaS平台中的启动延迟、静态配置和资源分配问题，显著提升了系统吞吐量并降低了成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: FaaS平台虽然具有基础设施抽象、按需执行和无空闲资源定价等优势，但仍面临启动延迟、静态配置、资源分配和调度不优等问题，导致函数性能不一致和意外运营成本。

Method: Saarthi采用输入感知的方法，基于请求负载特征智能预测资源需求，结合主动容错冗余机制和多目标整数线性规划模型，优化函数数量和资源配置。

Result: 在OpenFaaS上实现Saarthi，相比基线OpenFaaS，吞吐量提升1.45倍，成本降低1.84倍，服务等级目标保持98.3%，开销仅增加0.2秒。

Conclusion: Saarthi代表了向自驱动无服务器平台迈出的重要一步，通过智能资源管理和优化机制，有效解决了FaaS平台的性能一致性和成本控制问题。

Abstract: FaaS offers significant advantages with its infrastructure abstraction, on-demand execution, and attractive no idle resource pricing for modern cloud applications. Despite these benefits, challenges such as startup latencies, static configurations, sub-optimal resource allocation and scheduling still exist due to coupled resource offering and workload-agnostic generic scheduling behaviour. These issues often lead to inconsistent function performance and unexpected operational costs for users and service providers. This paper introduces Saarthi, a novel, end-to-end serverless framework that intelligently manages the dynamic resource needs of function workloads, representing a significant step toward self-driving serverless platforms. Unlike platforms that rely on static resource configurations, Saarthi is input-aware, allowing it to intelligently anticipate resource requirements based on the characteristics of an incoming request payload. This input-driven approach reinforces function right-sizing and enables smart request orchestration across available function configurations. Saarthi further integrates a proactive fault-tolerant redundancy mechanism and employs a multi-objective Integer Linear Programming (ILP) model to maintain an optimal function quantity. This optimisation aims to maximise system throughput while simultaneously reducing overall operational costs. We validate the effectiveness of Saarthi by implementing it as a framework atop OpenFaaS. Our results demonstrate Saarthi's ability to achieve up to 1.45x better throughput, 1.84x reduced costs, while maintaining up to 98.3% service level targets with an overhead of up to 0.2 seconds as compared to the baseline OpenFaaS.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然将ML通信集合操作卸载到DMA引擎可以高效重叠计算和通信，但先前研究仅在有限背景下进行。本文旨在全面评估DMA集合在性能、功耗和同步成本方面的表现，并解决小数据传输的性能瓶颈问题。

Method: 在AMD Instinct MI300X GPU上对DMA集合操作进行综合性能分析，识别DMA传输延迟瓶颈，利用现有DMA架构创新构建优化的DMA集合实现，并在真实硬件上验证其有效性。

Result: 与RCCL库相比，DMA集合在大数据传输（10MB到GB）中性能提升16%，功耗降低32%；但在小数据传输中性能较差（all-gather慢4.5倍，all-to-all慢2.5倍）。优化后显著缩小了小数据性能差距（all-gather仅慢30%，all-to-all快20%），并在大数据传输中进一步提升了7%性能和3-10%功耗节省。

Conclusion: 这项工作通过全面分析和优化DMA集合操作，显著提升了其在小数据传输中的性能，使DMA集合更适合集成到主流集合库中，为高效重叠计算和通信提供了可行解决方案。

Abstract: Offloading machine learning (ML) communication collectives to direct memory access (DMA) engines has emerged as an interesting and low-cost solution to efficiently overlap computation and communication in inference and training. Doing so delivers superior concurrent performance by freeing up all GPU cores for computation and also lowers interference in the memory sub-system (caches). While DMA collectives show strong promise, prior works have only studied them in limited context (bandwidth-bound transfer sizes only, performance-only).
  To address this, we provide a comprehensive performance, power/energy and synchronization costs analysis of offloading ML communication collectives (all-gather, all-to-all) to DMA engines on state-of-the-art AMD Instinct MI300X GPUs. Our analysis reveals that, compared to the state-of-the-art RCCL communication collectives library, DMA collectives are at-par or better for large sizes (10s of MB to GB) in terms of both performance (16% better) and power (32% better). However, they significantly lag for latency-bound small sizes; 4.5X and 2.5X slower for all-gather and all-to-all, respectively. We provide a detailed latency breakdown of a DMA transfer and identify that DMA command scheduling and synchronization costs can limit DMA collective performance. To tackle this, we harness existing DMA architecture innovations, hitherto untapped, to build optimized DMA collectives and demonstrate their efficacy on real hardware. Our optimized implementations considerably close the performance gap for DMA collectives at smaller sizes (30% slower and 20% faster all-gather and all-to-all, respectively) and further improves performance (by 7%) and power savings at larger sizes (3-10%). Overall, this work represents a significant step toward making DMA collectives suitable for adoption in mainstream collective libraries.

This study introduces a novel hybrid clustering protocol that integrates the Water Strider Algorithm (WSA) with Fuzzy C-Means (FCM) clustering to achieve superior energy efficiency and network longevity. The proposed WSA-FCM method employs WSA for global optimization of cluster- head positions and FCM for refined node membership assignment with fuzzy boundaries. Through extensive experimentation across networks of 200-800 nodes with 10 independent simulation runs, the method demonstrates significant improvements: First Node Death (FND) delayed by 16.1% ($678\pm12$ vs $584\pm18$ rounds), Last Node Death (LND) extended by 11.9% ($1,262\pm8$ vs $1,128\pm11$ rounds), and 37.4% higher residual energy retention ($5.47\pm0.09$ vs $3.98\pm0.11$ J) compared to state-of-the-art hybrid methods. Intra-cluster distances are reduced by 19.4% with statistical significance (p < 0.001). Theoretical analysis proves convergence guarantees and complexity bounds of $O(n\times c\times T)$, while empirical scalability analysis demonstrates near-linear scaling behaviour. The method outperforms recent hybrid approaches including MOALO-FCM, MSSO-MST, Fuzzy+HHO, and GWO-FCM across all performance metrics with rigorous statistical validation.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于GPU加速的高性能多工况联合分析框架(GMAF)，用于加速轴向柱塞泵(APP)动力学模拟的Picard迭代，显著提升了带纹理表面APP在多周期内的动态分析性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统CPU设备和求解器在需要精细网格的纹理表面复杂情况下计算效率低下，且无法处理多周期模拟，需要开发高性能计算框架来加速轴向柱塞泵的动力学分析。

Method: 设计了GMAF框架，采用带近似对称逐次超松弛预处理器的预处理共轭梯度法(PCG)，通过提升计算强度和扩大大规模并行计算规模来充分利用GPU设备，并在PCG求解器中采用同步收敛策略。

Conclusion: GPU加速的GMAF框架有效解决了轴向柱塞泵动力学模拟中的计算效率问题，能够处理多周期复杂工况，并揭示了纹理表面对泵性能的提升作用。

Abstract: Accurate simulation to dynamics of axial piston pump (APP) is essential for its design, manufacture and maintenance. However, limited by computation capacity of CPU device and traditional solvers, conventional iteration methods are inefficient in complicated case with textured surface requiring refined mesh, and could not handle simulation during multiple periods. To accelerate Picard iteration for predicting dynamics of APP, a GPU-boosted high-performance Multi-working condition joint Analysis Framework (GMAF) is designed, which adopts Preconditioned Conjugate Gradient method (PCG) using Approximate Symmetric Successive Over-Relaxation preconditioner (ASSOR). GMAF abundantly utilizes GPU device via elevating computational intensity and expanding scale of massive parallel computation. Therefore, it possesses novel performance in analyzing dynamics of both smooth and textured APPs during multiple periods, as the establishment and solution to joint algebraic system for pressure field are accelerated magnificently, as well as numerical integral for force and moment due to oil flow. Compared with asynchronized convergence strategy pursuing local convergence, synchronized convergence strategy targeting global convergence is adopted in PCG solver for the joint system. Revealed by corresponding results, oil force in axial direction and moment in circumferential directly respond to input pressure, while other components evolve in sinusoidal patterns. Specifically, force and moment due to normal pressure instantly reach their steady state initially, while ones due to viscous shear stress evolve during periods. After simulating dynamics of APP and pressure distribution via GMAF, the promotion of pressure capacity and torsion resistance due to textured surface is revealed numerically, as several 'steps' exist in the pressure field corresponding to textures.

Abstract: Failures are the norm in highly complex and heterogeneous devices spanning the distributed computing continuum (DCC), from resource-constrained IoT and edge nodes to high-performance computing systems. Ensuring reliability and global consistency across these layers remains a major challenge, especially for AI-driven workloads requiring real-time, adaptive coordination. This paper introduces a Probabilistic Active Inference Resilience Agent (PAIR-Agent) to achieve resilience in DCC systems. PAIR-Agent performs three core operations: (i) constructing a causal fault graph from device logs, (ii) identifying faults while managing certainties and uncertainties using Markov blankets and the free-energy principle, and (iii) autonomously healing issues through active inference. Through continuous monitoring and adaptive reconfiguration, the agent maintains service continuity and stability under diverse failure conditions. Theoretical validations confirm the reliability and effectiveness of the proposed framework.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的LLM服务模拟器存在两个关键问题：硬件模型集成困难，以及仅支持有限的服务技术，缺乏能够捕捉现代LLM服务方法广度的基础设施。

Method: 采用基于跟踪的性能建模和操作级延迟分析器，支持通过单一命令集成新加速器，同时嵌入最新的服务技术，并提供灵活的路由、缓存管理和调度策略接口。

Conclusion: LLMServingSim2.0为硬件开发者和LLM服务提供商提供了一个低硬件扩展成本、高精度的综合平台。

Abstract: This paper introduces LLMServingSim2.0, a system simulator designed for exploring heterogeneous hardware in large-scale LLM serving systems. LLMServingSim2.0 addresses two key limitations of its predecessor: (1) integrating hardware models into system-level simulators is non-trivial due to the lack of a clear abstraction, and (2) existing simulators support only a narrow subset of serving techniques, leaving no infrastructure that captures the breadth of approaches in modern LLM serving. To overcome these issues, LLMServingSim2.0 adopts trace-driven performance modeling, accompanied by an operator-level latency profiler, enabling the integration of new accelerators with a single command. It further embeds up-to-date serving techniques while exposing flexible interfaces for request routing, cache management, and scheduling policies. In a TPU case study, our profiler requires 18.5x fewer LoC and outperforms the predecessor's hardware-simulator integration, demonstrating LLMServingSim2.0's low-effort hardware extensibility. Our experiments further show that LLMServingSim2.0 reproduces GPU-based LLM serving with 1.9% error, while maintaining practical simulation time, making it a comprehensive platform for both hardware developers and LLM service providers.

TL;DR: 对苹果芯片上五个本地大语言模型运行时的系统实证评估：MLX、MLC-LLM、llama.cpp、Ollama和PyTorch MPS。MLX实现最高持续生成吞吐量，MLC-LLM提供更低的首次令牌延迟，所有框架都完全在设备上运行，确保隐私保护。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估苹果芯片上不同LLM运行时的性能表现，为私有、设备端LLM推理提供基于证据的部署建议。

Method: 在配备M2 Ultra处理器和192GB统一内存的Mac Studio上，使用Qwen-2.5模型家族，测试从几百到10万令牌的提示，测量首次令牌时间、稳态吞吐量、延迟百分位数、长上下文行为等指标。

Result: MLX达到最高持续生成吞吐量，MLC-LLM在中等提示大小下提供更低的首次令牌延迟，llama.cpp在轻量级单流使用中高效，Ollama注重开发者体验但吞吐量和首次令牌延迟较差，PyTorch MPS受内存限制。

Conclusion: 苹果芯片推理框架虽然绝对性能仍落后于NVIDIA GPU系统，但正快速成熟为私有、设备端LLM推理的可行生产级解决方案。

Abstract: We present a systematic, empirical evaluation of five local large language model (LLM) runtimes on Apple Silicon: MLX, MLC-LLM, llama.cpp, Ollama, and PyTorch MPS. Experiments were conducted on a Mac Studio equipped with an M2 Ultra processor and 192 GB of unified memory. Using the Qwen-2.5 model family across prompts ranging from a few hundred to 100,000 tokens, we measure time-to-first-token (TTFT), steady-state throughput, latency percentiles, long-context behavior (key-value and prompt caching), quantization support, streaming performance, batching and concurrency behavior, and deployment complexity.
  Under our settings, MLX achieves the highest sustained generation throughput, while MLC-LLM delivers consistently lower TTFT for moderate prompt sizes and offers stronger out-of-the-box inference features. llama.cpp is highly efficient for lightweight single-stream use, Ollama emphasizes developer ergonomics but lags in throughput and TTFT, and PyTorch MPS remains limited by memory constraints on large models and long contexts.
  All frameworks execute fully on-device with no telemetry, ensuring strong privacy guarantees. We release scripts, logs, and plots to reproduce all results. Our analysis clarifies the design trade-offs in Apple-centric LLM deployments and provides evidence-based recommendations for interactive and long-context processing. Although Apple Silicon inference frameworks still trail NVIDIA GPU-based systems such as vLLM in absolute performance, they are rapidly maturing into viable, production-grade solutions for private, on-device LLM inference.

Abstract: Three-dimensional (3D) integration continues to advance Moore's Law by facilitating dense interconnects and enabling multi-tier system architectures. Among the various integration approaches, Cu-Cu hybrid bonding has emerged as a leading solution for achieving high interconnect density in chiplet integration. In this work, we present YAP+, a yield modeling framework specifically tailored for wafer-to-wafer (W2W) and die-to-wafer (D2W) hybrid bonding processes. YAP+ incorporates a comprehensive set of yield-impacting failure mechanisms, including overlay misalignment, particle defects, Cu recess variations, surface roughness, and Cu pad density. Furthermore, YAP+ supports pad layout-aware yield analysis, considering critical, redundant, and dummy pads across arbitrary 2D physical layout patterns. To support practical evaluation, we developed an open-source yield simulator, demonstrating that our near-analytical model matches simulation accuracy while achieving over 1,000x speedup in runtime. This performance makes YAP+ a valuable tool for co-optimizing packaging technologies, assembly design rules, and system-level design strategies. Beyond W2W-D2W comparisons, we leverage YAP+ to investigate the impact of pad layout patterns, bonding pitch, and pad ratios across different pad types, and explore the benefits of strategically placing redundant pad replicas.

Conclusion: 所提方法在FPGA基TDC中实现了竞争性或更优的性能，且硬件开销更低，适用于可编程逻辑平台的高分辨率时间测量和精确延迟校准。

Abstract: We present a Time-to-Digital Converter (TDC) implemented on a 16 nm Xilinx UltraScale Plus FPGA that achieves a resolution of 1.15 ps, RMS precision of 3.38 ps, a differential nonlinearity (DNL) of [-0.43, 0.24] LSB, and an integral nonlinearity (INL) of [-2.67, 0.15] LSB. This work introduces two novel hardware-independent post-processing techniques - Partial Order Reconstruction (POR) and Iterative Time-bin Interleaving (ITI) - that significantly enhance the performance of FPGA-based TDCs. POR addresses the missing code problem by inferring the partial order of each time bin through code density test data and directed acyclic graph (DAG) analysis, enabling near-complete recovery of usable bins. ITI further improves fine time resolution by merging multiple calibrated tapped delay lines (TDLs) into a single unified delay chain, achieving scalable resolution without resorting to averaging. Compared to state-of-the-art FPGA-based TDC architectures, the proposed methods deliver competitive or superior performance with reduced hardware overhead. These techniques are broadly applicable to high-resolution time measurement and precise delay calibration in programmable logic platforms.

Motivation: 虽然FPGA具有细粒度数据控制和高能效优势，但近期GPU优化缩小了FPGA的优势，特别是在基于算术的计算方面。需要利用FPGA丰富的片上内存，将LLM推理从算术计算转向基于内存的计算。

Abstract: The rapid progress of large language models (LLMs) has advanced numerous applications, yet efficient single-batch inference remains vital for on-device intelligence. While FPGAs offer fine-grained data control and high energy efficiency, recent GPU optimizations have narrowed their advantage, especially under arithmetic-based computation. To overcome this, we leverage FPGAs' abundant on-chip memory to shift LLM inference from arithmetic- to memory-based computation through table lookups. We present LUT-LLM, the first FPGA accelerator enabling 1B+ LLM inference via vector-quantized memory operations. Our analysis identifies activation-weight co-quantization as the most effective scheme, supported by (1) bandwidth-aware parallel centroid search, (2) efficient 2D table lookups, and (3) a spatial-temporal hybrid design minimizing data caching. Implemented on an AMD V80 FPGA for a customized Qwen 3 1.7B model, LUT-LLM achieves 1.66x lower latency than AMD MI210 and 1.72x higher energy efficiency than NVIDIA A100, scaling to 32B models with 2.16x efficiency gain over A100.

Motivation: 3D堆叠和多级单元技术虽然提高了NAND闪存容量，但引入了横向电荷扩散(LCS)等新的可靠性挑战，这会显著增加保留错误，影响现代SSD的寿命。

Method: 开发了状态感知随机化器(STAR)，主动消除导致LCS保留错误的弱数据模式，并通过优化方案高效集成到SSD控制器的现有I/O数据路径中。

Result: 实验结果显示，STAR将SSD寿命提升高达2.3倍，在实际工作负载下平均减少50%的读取延迟。

Conclusion: STAR方案能有效解决3D NAND闪存中的LCS问题，显著提升SSD可靠性和性能，且易于集成到现有SSD架构中。

Abstract: Although NAND flash memory has achieved continuous capacity improvements via advanced 3D stacking and multi-level cell technologies, these innovations introduce new reliability challenges, par- ticularly lateral charge spreading (LCS), absent in low-capacity 2D flash memory. Since LCS significantly increases retention errors over time, addressing this problem is essential to ensure the lifetime of modern SSDs employing high-capacity 3D flash memory. In this paper, we propose a novel data randomizer, STate-Aware Randomizer (STAR), which proactively eliminates the majority of weak data patterns responsible for retention errors caused by LCS. Unlike existing techniques that target only specific worst-case patterns, STAR effectively removes a broad spectrum of weak patterns, significantly enhancing reliability against LCS. By employing several optimization schemes, STAR can be efficiently integrated into the existing I/O datapath of an SSD controller with negligible timing overhead. To evaluate the proposed STAR scheme, we developed a STAR-aware SSD emulator based on characterization results from 160 real 3D NAND flash chips. Experimental results demonstrate that STAR improves SSD lifetime by up to 2.3x and reduces read latency by an average of 50% on real-world traces compared to conventional SSDs

Conclusion: 该混合精度可扩展的MX MAC设计有效解决了现有设计的局限性，在保持高能效的同时实现了混合精度累加，为持续学习应用提供了高效的NPU解决方案。

Abstract: Emerging continual learning applications necessitate next-generation neural processing unit (NPU) platforms to support both training and inference operations. The promising Microscaling (MX) standard enables narrow bit-widths for inference and large dynamic ranges for training. However, existing MX multiply-accumulate (MAC) designs face a critical trade-off: integer accumulation requires expensive conversions from narrow floating-point products, while FP32 accumulation suffers from quantization losses and costly normalization. To address these limitations, we propose a hybrid precision-scalable reduction tree for MX MACs that combines the benefits of both approaches, enabling efficient mixed-precision accumulation with controlled accuracy relaxation. Moreover, we integrate an 8x8 array of these MACs into the state-of-the-art (SotA) NPU integration platform, SNAX, to provide efficient control and data transfer to our optimized precision-scalable MX datapath. We evaluate our design both on MAC and system level and compare it to the SotA. Our integrated system achieves an energy efficiency of 657, 1438-1675, and 4065 GOPS/W, respectively, for MXINT8, MXFP8/6, and MXFP4, with a throughput of 64, 256, and 512 GOPS.

Abstract: The data centers of today are running diverse workloads sharing many common lower level functions called tax components. Any optimization to any tax component will lead to performance improvements across the data center fleet. Typically, performance enhancements in tax components are achieved by offloading them to accelerators, however, it is not practical to offload every tax component. The goal of this paper is to identify opportunities to offload more than one tax component together. We focus on MongoDB which is a common microservice used in a large number of applications in the datacenter. We profile MongoDB running as part of the DeathStarBench benchmark suite, identifying its tax components and their microarchitectural implications. We make observations and suggestions based on the inferences made to offload a few of the tax components in this application.

Abstract: Embedding vector operations are a key component of modern deep neural network workloads. Unlike matrix operations with deterministic access patterns, embedding vector operations exhibit input data-dependent and non-deterministic memory accesses. Existing neural processing unit (NPU) simulators focus on matrix computations with simple double-buffered on-chip memory systems, lacking the modeling capability for realistic embedding behavior. Next-generation NPUs, however, call for more flexible on-chip memory architectures that can support diverse access and management schemes required by embedding workloads. To enable flexible exploration and design of emerging NPU architectures, we present EONSim, an NPU simulator that holistically models both matrix and embedding vector operations. EONSim integrates a validated performance model for matrix computations with detailed memory simulation for embedding accesses, supporting various on-chip memory management policies. Validated against TPUv6e, EONSim achieves an average inference time error of 1.4\% and an average on-chip memory access count error of 2.2\%.

Abstract: Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) have become essential in cloud computing due to their reconfigurability, energy efficiency, and ability to accelerate domain-specific workloads. As FPGA adoption grows, research into task scheduling and preemption techniques has intensified. However, the field lacks a standardized benchmarking framework for consistent and reproducible evaluation. Many existing studies propose innovative scheduling or preemption mechanisms but often rely on proprietary or synthetic benchmarks, limiting generalizability and making comparison difficult. This methodical fragmentation hinders effective evaluation of scheduling strategies and preemption in multi-tenant FPGA environments.
  This paper presents the first open-source preemption-enabled benchmark suite for evaluating FPGA preemption strategies and testing new scheduling algorithms, without requiring users to create preemption workloads from scratch. The suite includes 27 diverse applications spanning cryptography, AI/ML, computation-intensive workloads, communication systems, and multimedia processing. Each benchmark integrates comprehensive context-saving and restoration mechanisms, facilitating reproducible research and consistent comparisons. Our suite not only simplifies testing FPGA scheduling policies but also benefits OS research by enabling the evaluation of scheduling fairness, resource allocation efficiency, and context-switching performance in multi-tenant FPGA systems, ultimately supporting the development of better operating systems and scheduling policies for FPGA-based environments. We also provide guidelines for adding new benchmarks, enabling future research to expand and refine FPGA preemption and scheduling evaluation.

Abstract: The integration of spiking neural networks (SNNs) with transformer-based architectures has opened new opportunities for bio-inspired low-power, event-driven visual reasoning on edge devices. However, the high temporal resolution and binary nature of spike-driven computation introduce architectural mismatches with conventional digital hardware (CPU/GPU). Prior neuromorphic and Processing-in-Memory (PIM) accelerators struggle with high sparsity and complex operations prevalent in such models. To address these challenges, we propose a memory-centric hardware accelerator tailored for spiking transformers, optimized for deployment in real-time event-driven frameworks such as classification with both static and event-based input frames. Our design leverages a hybrid analog-digital PIM architecture with input sparsity optimizations, and a custom-designed dataflow to minimize memory access overhead and maximize data reuse under spatiotemporal sparsity, for compute and memory-efficient end-to-end execution of spiking transformers. We subsequently propose inference-time software optimizations for layer skipping, and timestep reduction, leveraging Bayesian Optimization with surrogate modeling to perform robust, efficient co-exploration of the joint algorithmic-microarchitectural design spaces under tight computational budgets. Evaluated on both image(ImageNet) and event-based (CIFAR-10 DVS, DVSGesture) classification, the accelerator achieves up to ~467x and ~1.86x energy reduction compared to edge GPU (Jetson Orin Nano) and previous PIM accelerators for spiking transformers, while maintaining competitive task accuracy on ImageNet dataset. This work enables a new class of intelligent ubiquitous edge AI, built using spiking transformer acceleration for low-power, real-time visual processing at the extreme edge.

Abstract: The substantial memory bandwidth and computational demand of large language models (LLMs) present critical challenges for efficient inference. To tackle this, the literature has explored heterogeneous systems that combine neural processing units (NPUs) with DRAM-based processing-in-memory (PIM) for LLM acceleration. However, existing high-precision (e.g., FP16) PIM compute units incur significant area and power overhead in DRAM technology, limiting the effective computation throughput. In this paper, we introduce P3-LLM, a novel NPU-PIM integrated accelerator for LLM inference using hybrid numerical formats. Our approach is threefold: First, we propose a flexible mixed-precision quantization scheme, which leverages hybrid numerical formats to quantize different LLM operands with high compression efficiency and minimal accuracy loss. Second, we architect an efficient PIM accelerator co-design for P3-LLM, featuring lightweight compute units to support our hybrid numerical formats. The enhanced PIM compute units significantly boost the computation throughput under iso-area constraints. Third, we optimize the low-precision dataflow of different LLM modules by applying operator fusion to minimize the overhead of runtime dequantization. Our evaluation on a diverse set of representative LLMs and tasks demonstrates that P3-LLM achieves state-of-the-art quantization accuracy in terms of both KV-cache-only quantization and weight-activation quantization. Combining the proposed quantization scheme with PIM architecture co-design, P3-LLM yields an average of $4.9\times$, $2.0\times$, and $3.4\times$ speedups over the state-of-the-art LLM accelerators HBM-PIM, Ecco, and Pimba, respectively.

Abstract: General Matrix Multiplication (GEMM) is a fundamental operation in many scientific workloads, signal processing, and particularly deep learning. It is often a bottleneck for performance and energy efficiency, especially in edge environments with tight resource and power constraints. AMD's Versal ACAP offers heterogeneous components (AIEs, PL, PS) that can address these challenges, but mapping GEMM across them is complex, with prior works largely overlooking energy-performance trade-offs. In this paper, we propose an automated framework for Versal ACAP that generates GEMM mappings optimized for either performance or energy efficiency. Unlike prior analytical approaches, our method leverages a Machine Learning (ML) model, trained on approximately 6000 on-board experiments of different GEMM mappings, to guide Design Space Exploration, yielding more efficient designs. Evaluation on the Versal VCK190 shows geomean improvements of 1.23x (up to 2.5x) in throughput and 1.25x (up to 2.7x) in energy efficiency over state-of-the-art frameworks.

Hardware verification confirms successful FPGA deployment with verified 64 KB BRAM memory interface and AXI interconnect functionality. All performance metrics are obtained from physical hardware measurements. This work establishes a reproducible framework for ISA-guided FPGA acceleration that complements fixed-function ASICs by trading peak performance for programmability.

Abstract: Implantable devices for reliable intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG) require efficient, accurate, and real-time detection of seizures. Dense hyperdimensional computing (HDC) proves to be efficient over neural networks; however, it still consumes considerable switching power for an ultra-low energy application. Sparse HDC, on the other hand, has the potential of further reducing the energy consumption, yet at the expense of having to support more complex operations and introducing an extra hyperparameter, the maximum hypervector density. To improve the energy and area efficiency of the sparse HDC operations, this work introduces the compressed item memory (CompIM) and simplifies the spatial bundling. We also analyze how a proper hyperparameter choice improves the detection delay compared to dense HDC. Ultimately, our optimizations achieve a 1.73x more energy- and 2.20x more area-efficient hardware design than the naive sparse implementation. We are also 7.50x more energy- and 3.24x more area-efficient than the dense HDC implementation. This work highlights the hardware advantages of sparse HDC, demonstrating its potential to enable smaller brain implants with a substantially extended battery life compared to the current state-of-the-art.
