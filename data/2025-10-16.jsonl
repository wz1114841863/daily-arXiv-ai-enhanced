Quantization is\nfundamental to enable LLMs on resource-constrained edge devices, and llama.cpp\nutilizes block floating point (BFP) quantization to drastically reduce the bit\nwidth of weights and input tensors, the memory footprint, and the computational\npower required to run LLMs. LLMs are typically quantized with mixed BFP\nquantization across the model layers to reduce the loss of model accuracy due\nto quantization. Therefore, to efficiently accelerate across the layers of\nBFP-quantized LLMs, specialized accelerators need to support different BFP\nvariants without reconfiguration.

In\nthis work, we conduct a thorough investigation into the root causes of\npseudo-alignment in LLM4TS and build a connection of pseudo-alignment to the\ncone effect in LLM.

Most existing deep\nlearning methods for epilepsy detection rely solely on unimodal EEG signals,\nneglecting the potential benefits of multimodal information. To address this,\nwe propose a novel multimodal model, DistilCLIP-EEG, based on the CLIP\nframework, which integrates both EEG signals and text descriptions to capture\ncomprehensive features of epileptic seizures. The model involves an EEG encoder\nbased on the Conformer architecture as a text encoder, the proposed Learnable\nBERT (BERT-LP) as prompt learning within the encoders. Both operate in a shared\nlatent space for effective cross-modal representation learning. To enhance\nefficiency and adaptability, we introduce a knowledge distillation method where\nthe trained DistilCLIP-EEG serves as a teacher to guide a more compact student\nmodel to reduce training complexity and time. On the TUSZ, AUBMC, and CHB-MIT\ndatasets, both the teacher and student models achieved accuracy rates exceeding\n97%.

A Comparative Study In Terms of Basis Alignment and SGD Noise", "comment": null, "summary": "Diagonal preconditioners are computationally feasible approximate to\nsecond-order optimizers, which have shown significant promise in accelerating\ntraining of deep learning models. Two predominant approaches are based on Adam\nand Gauss-Newton (GN) methods: the former leverages statistics of current\ngradients and is the de-factor optimizers for neural networks, and the latter\nuses the diagonal elements of the Gauss-Newton matrix and underpins some of the\nrecent diagonal optimizers such as Sophia.\n  In this work, we compare these two diagonal preconditioning methods through\nthe lens of two key factors: the choice of basis in the preconditioner, and the\nimpact of gradient noise from mini-batching. To gain insights, we analyze these\noptimizers on quadratic objectives and logistic regression under all four\nquadrants. We show that regardless of the basis, there exist instances where\nAdam outperforms both GN$^{-1}$ and GN$^{-1/2}$ in full-batch settings.\nConversely, in the stochastic regime, Adam behaves similarly to GN$^{-1/2}$ for\nlinear regression under a Gaussian data assumption. These theoretical results\nare supported by empirical studies on both convex and non-convex objectives."}

To address these issues, we\npropose InfoRM, an information-theoretic reward modeling framework based on the\nInformation Bottleneck (IB) principle, which filters out preference-irrelevant\ninformation to alleviate reward misgeneralization. We further observe that\nreward-hacked responses manifest as pronounced outliers in InfoRM's IB latent\nspace, measured by Mahalanobis distance from the SFT-induced distribution.\nMotivated by this, we introduce IBL, a distribution-level regularization that\npenalizes such deviations, effectively expanding the optimization landscape\nwhile maintaining alignment. We prove that IBL is theoretically equivalent to\nthe pessimistic RL objective within the IB latent space. Finally, we present\nMahalanobis Outlier Probability (MOP), a statistical metric for quantifying\nreward hacking severity, enabling principled hyperparameter tuning and online\nmitigation such as early stopping.
