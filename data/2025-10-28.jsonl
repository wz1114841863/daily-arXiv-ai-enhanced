To address these challenges, we introduce preference\noptimization into precipitation nowcasting for the first time, motivated by the\nsuccess of reinforcement learning from human feedback in large language models.\nSpecifically, we propose SynCast, a method that employs the two-stage\npost-training framework of Diffusion Sequential Preference Optimization\n(Diffusion-SPO), to progressively align conflicting metrics and consistently\nachieve superior performance. In the first stage, the framework focuses on\nreducing FAR, training the model to effectively suppress false alarms. Building\non this foundation, the second stage further optimizes CSI with constraints\nthat preserve FAR alignment, thereby achieving synergistic improvements across\nthese conflicting metrics."}

Diffusion modeling starts by defining a\nforward process that gradually corrupts data into noise, linking the data\ndistribution to a simple prior through a continuum of intermediate\ndistributions. The goal is to learn a reverse process that transforms noise\nback into data while recovering the same intermediates. We describe three\ncomplementary views. The variational view, inspired by variational\nautoencoders, sees diffusion as learning to remove noise step by step. The\nscore-based view, rooted in energy-based modeling, learns the gradient of the\nevolving data distribution, indicating how to nudge samples toward more likely\nregions. The flow-based view, related to normalizing flows, treats generation\nas following a smooth path that moves samples from noise to data under a\nlearned velocity field.

Defending against novel jailbreaks\nrepresents a critical challenge in AI safety. Adversarial training -- designed\nto make models robust against worst-case perturbations -- has been the dominant\nparadigm for adversarial robustness. However, due to optimization challenges\nand difficulties in defining realistic threat models, adversarial training\nmethods often fail on newly developed jailbreaks in practice. This paper\nproposes a new paradigm for improving robustness against unseen jailbreaks,\ncentered on the Adversarial D\\'ej\\`a Vu hypothesis: novel jailbreaks are not\nfundamentally new, but largely recombinations of adversarial skills from\nprevious attacks. We study this hypothesis through a large-scale analysis of 32\nattack papers published over two years.

Our analysis reveals that unseen\nattacks can be effectively explained as sparse compositions of earlier skills,\nwith explanatory power increasing monotonically as skill coverage grows. Guided\nby this insight, we introduce Adversarial Skill Compositional Training (ASCoT),\nwhich trains on diverse compositions of skill primitives rather than isolated\nattack instances. ASCoT substantially improves robustness to unseen attacks,\nincluding multi-turn jailbreaks, while maintaining low over-refusal rates.

This experience\nstitching capability is often viewed as the purview of temporal difference (TD)\nmethods. However, outside of small tabular settings, trajectories never\nintersect, calling into question this conventional wisdom. Moreover, the common\nbelief is that Monte Carlo (MC) methods should not be able to recombine\nexperience, yet it remains unclear whether function approximation could result\nin a form of implicit stitching. The goal of this paper is to empirically study\nwhether the conventional wisdom about stitching actually holds in settings\nwhere function approximation is used. We empirically demonstrate that Monte\nCarlo (MC) methods can also achieve experience stitching. While TD methods do\nachieve slightly stronger capabilities than MC methods (in line with\nconventional wisdom), that gap is significantly smaller than the gap between\nsmall and large neural networks (even on quite simple tasks). We find that\nincreasing critic capacity effectively reduces the generalization gap for both\nthe MC and TD methods. These results suggest that the traditional TD inductive\nbias for stitching may be less necessary in the era of large models for RL and,\nin some cases, may offer diminishing returns. Additionally, our results suggest\nthat stitching, a form of generalization unique to the RL setting, might be\nachieved not through specialized algorithms (temporal difference learning) but\nrather through the same recipe that has provided generalization in other\nmachine learning settings (via scale).

This thesis, titled Epistemic Deep Learning: Enabling\nMachine Learning Models to 'Know When They Do Not Know', addresses these\ncritical challenges by advancing the paradigm of Epistemic Artificial\nIntelligence, which explicitly models and quantifies epistemic uncertainty: the\nuncertainty arising from limited, biased, or incomplete training data, as\nopposed to the irreducible randomness of aleatoric uncertainty, thereby\nempowering models to acknowledge their limitations and refrain from\noverconfident decisions when uncertainty is high.\n  Central to this work is the development of the Random-Set Neural Network\n(RS-NN), a novel methodology that leverages random set theory to predict belief\nfunctions over sets of classes, capturing the extent of epistemic uncertainty\nthrough the width of associated credal sets, applications of RS-NN, including\nits adaptation to Large Language Models (LLMs) and its deployment in weather\nclassification for autonomous racing. In addition, the thesis proposes a\nunified evaluation framework for uncertainty-aware classifiers. Extensive\nexperiments validate that integrating epistemic awareness into deep learning\nnot only mitigates the risks associated with overconfident predictions but also\nlays the foundation for a paradigm shift in artificial intelligence, where the\nability to 'know when it does not know' becomes a hallmark of robust and\ndependable systems. The title encapsulates the core philosophy of this work,\nemphasizing that true intelligence involves recognizing and managing the limits\nof one's own knowledge."}

The agent is rewarded when their selection improves the\nperformance on the primary task. We also experiment with learning optimal\nstrategies for weighing the auxiliary loss per data point. On the 20-Superclass\nCIFAR100 problem, our RL approach outperforms human-labeled auxiliary tasks and\nperforms as well as a prominent Bi-Level Optimization technique. Our weight\nlearning approaches significantly outperform all of these benchmarks. For\nexample, a Weight-Aware RL-based approach helps the VGG16 architecture achieve\n80.9% test accuracy while the human-labeled auxiliary task setup achieved\n75.53%. The goal of this work is to (1) prove that RL is a viable approach to\ndynamically generate auxiliary tasks and (2) demonstrate that per-sample\nauxiliary task weights can be learned alongside the auxiliary task labels and\ncan achieve strong results."}

To answer this, we introduce SimpleToolHalluBench,\na diagnostic benchmark measuring tool hallucination in two failure modes: (i)\nno tool available, and (ii) only distractor tools available. Through controlled\nexperiments, we establish three key findings. First, we demonstrate a causal\nrelationship: progressively enhancing reasoning through RL increases tool\nhallucination proportionally with task performance gains. Second, this effect\ntranscends overfitting - training on non-tool tasks (e.g., mathematics) still\namplifies subsequent tool hallucination. Third, the effect is method-agnostic,\nappearing when reasoning is instilled via supervised fine-tuning and when it is\nmerely elicited at inference by switching from direct answers to step-by-step\nthinking. We also evaluate mitigation strategies including Prompt Engineering\nand Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), revealing a fundamental\nreliability-capability trade-off: reducing hallucination consistently degrades\nutility.

However, these advantages have not been consistently observed, the\ninference and learning dynamics of PCNs are still poorly understood, and deep\nPCNs remain practically untrainable. Here, we make significant progress towards\nscaling PCNs by taking a theoretical approach grounded in optimisation theory.\nFirst, we show that the learning dynamics of PC can be understood as an\napproximate trust-region method using second-order information, despite\nexplicitly using only first-order local updates. Second, going beyond this\napproximation, we show that PC can in principle make use of arbitrarily\nhigher-order information, such that for feedforward networks the effective\nlandscape on which PC learns is far more benign and robust to vanishing\ngradients than the (mean squared error) loss landscape. Third, motivated by a\nstudy of the inference dynamics of PCNs, we propose a new parameterisation\ncalled ``$\\mu$PC'', which for the first time allows stable training of 100+\nlayer networks with little tuning and competitive performance on simple tasks.\nOverall, this thesis significantly advances our fundamental understanding of\nthe inference and learning dynamics of PCNs, while highlighting the need for\nfuture research to focus on hardware co-design if PC is to compete with BP at\nscale."}
