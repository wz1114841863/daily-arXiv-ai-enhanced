In this\npaper, we introduce a benchmarking tool named ELIB (edge LLM inference\nbenchmarking) to evaluate LLM inference performance of different edge\nplatforms, and propose a novel metric named MBU to indicate the percentage of\nthe theoretically efficient use of available memory bandwidth for a specific\nmodel running on edge hardware to optimize memory usage. We deploy ELIB on\nthree edge platforms and benchmark using five quantized models to optimize MBU\nin combination with other metrics such as FLOPS, throughput, latency and\naccuracy.

It allows processes to delay the visibility of\nwrites through store buffering. While this supports hardware-level\noptimizations and makes a significant contribution to multiprocessor\nefficiency, it complicates reasoning about correctness, as executions may\nviolate sequential consistency. Ensuring correct behavior often requires\ninserting synchronization primitives such as memory fences ($F$) or atomic\nread-modify-write ($RMW$) operations, but this approach can incur significant\nperformance costs. In this work, we develop a semantic framework that precisely\ncharacterizes when such synchronization is necessary under TSO. We introduce a\nnovel TSO-specific occurs-before relation, which adapts Lamport's celebrated\nhappens-before relation from asynchronous message-passing systems to the TSO\nsetting. Our main result is a theorem that proves that the only way to ensure\nthat two events that take place at different sites are temporally ordered is by\nhaving the execution create an occurs-before chain between the events. By\nstudying the role of fences and $RMW$s in creating occurs-before chains, we are\nthen able to capture cases in which these costly synchronization operations are\nunavoidable. Since proper real-time ordering of events is a fundamental aspect\nof consistency conditions such as Linearizability, our analysis provides a\nsound theoretical understanding of essential aspects of the TSO model. In\nparticular, we are able to generalize prior lower bounds for linearizable\nimplementations of shared memory objects. Our results capture the structure of\ninformation flow and causality in the TSO model by extending the standard\ncommunication-based reasoning from asynchronous systems to the TSO memory\nmodel."}

However, many real-world systems, such as social or\nbiological networks, exhibit complex interactions that are more naturally\nrepresented by higher-order topological domains. The emerging field of\nGeometric and Topological Deep Learning addresses this challenge by introducing\nmethods that utilize and benefit from higher-order structures. Central to TDL\nis the concept of lifting, which transforms data representations from basic\ngraph forms to more expressive topologies before the application of GNN models\nfor learning. In this work, we propose a structural lifting strategy using\nForman-Ricci curvature, which defines an edge-based network characteristic\nbased on Riemannian geometry. Curvature reveals local and global properties of\na graph, such as a network's backbones, i.e. coarse, structure-preserving graph\ngeometries that form connections between major communities - most suitably\nrepresented as hyperedges to model information flows between clusters across\nlarge distances in the network.
