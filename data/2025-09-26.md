### [1] [Sig2Model: A Boosting-Driven Model for Updatable Learned Indexes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20781)
*Alireza Heidari,Amirhossein Ahmad,Wei Zhang,Ying Xiong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Sig2Model是一种高效自适应的学习索引，通过局部sigmoid函数近似数据分布变化、高斯混合模型预测高更新概率区域以及神经联合优化框架，显著降低了动态更新时的重训练成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统学习索引在静态数据集上表现优异，但在动态更新场景下性能下降严重，因为维护CDF不变性需要全局模型重训练，这会阻塞查询并限制QPS。现有方法未能有效解决重训练成本问题。

Method: 1) 使用sigmoid增强近似技术动态调整索引模型；2) 通过高斯混合模型进行主动更新训练；3) 采用神经联合优化框架持续优化sigmoid集成和GMM参数。

Result: 在真实世界和合成工作负载上评估显示，Sig2Model将重训练成本降低高达20倍，QPS提升高达3倍，内存使用减少高达1000倍。

Conclusion: Sig2Model通过创新的局部近似和主动优化技术，有效解决了学习索引在动态更新环境中的性能瓶颈，为实际工作负载提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Learned Indexes (LIs) represent a paradigm shift from traditional index
structures by employing machine learning models to approximate the cumulative
distribution function (CDF) of sorted data. While LIs achieve remarkable
efficiency for static datasets, their performance degrades under dynamic
updates: maintaining the CDF invariant (sum of F(k) equals 1) requires global
model retraining, which blocks queries and limits the queries-per-second (QPS)
metric. Current approaches fail to address these retraining costs effectively,
rendering them unsuitable for real-world workloads with frequent updates. In
this paper, we present Sig2Model, an efficient and adaptive learned index that
minimizes retraining cost through three key techniques: (1) a sigmoid boosting
approximation technique that dynamically adjusts the index model by
approximating update-induced shifts in data distribution with localized sigmoid
functions while preserving bounded error guarantees and deferring full
retraining; (2) proactive update training via Gaussian mixture models (GMMs)
that identifies high-update-probability regions for strategic placeholder
allocation to speed up updates; and (3) a neural joint optimization framework
that continuously refines both the sigmoid ensemble and GMM parameters via
gradient-based learning. We evaluate Sig2Model against state-of-the-art
updatable learned indexes on real-world and synthetic workloads, and show that
Sig2Model reduces retraining cost by up to 20x, achieves up to 3x higher QPS,
and uses up to 1000x less memory.

### [2] [A Theory of Multi-Agent Generative Flow Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20408)
*Leo Maxime Brunswic,Haozhi Wang,Shuang Luo,Jianye Hao,Amir Rasouli,Yinchuan Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了多智能体生成流网络的理论框架，包括四种算法，实现了集中训练与分散执行的结合，实验证明优于强化学习和MCMC方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成流网络使用流匹配损失学习生成对象的随机策略，但目前缺乏多智能体生成流网络的理论框架。

Method: 提出了MA-GFlowNets理论框架，包含集中式流网络、独立流网络、联合流网络及其条件版本四种算法，基于局部-全局原则进行训练。

Result: 实验结果表明，所提框架在性能上优于强化学习和基于MCMC的方法。

Conclusion: MA-GFlowNets为多智能体协作生成对象提供了有效的理论框架和算法实现，具有理论保证和实际应用价值。

Abstract: Generative flow networks utilize a flow-matching loss to learn a stochastic
policy for generating objects from a sequence of actions, such that the
probability of generating a pattern can be proportional to the corresponding
given reward. However, a theoretical framework for multi-agent generative flow
networks (MA-GFlowNets) has not yet been proposed. In this paper, we propose
the theory framework of MA-GFlowNets, which can be applied to multiple agents
to generate objects collaboratively through a series of joint actions. We
further propose four algorithms: a centralized flow network for centralized
training of MA-GFlowNets, an independent flow network for decentralized
execution, a joint flow network for achieving centralized training with
decentralized execution, and its updated conditional version. Joint Flow
training is based on a local-global principle allowing to train a collection of
(local) GFN as a unique (global) GFN. This principle provides a loss of
reasonable complexity and allows to leverage usual results on GFN to provide
theoretical guarantees that the independent policies generate samples with
probability proportional to the reward function. Experimental results
demonstrate the superiority of the proposed framework compared to reinforcement
learning and MCMC-based methods.

### [3] [FastEagle: Cascaded Drafting for Accelerating Speculative Decoding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20416)
*Haiduo Huang,Jiangcheng Song,Wenzhe Zhao,Pengju Ren*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FastEagle是一种非自回归级联草稿器，通过单次前向传播生成整个草稿，替代了传统需要N次顺序传递的方法，实现了无损LLM推理加速。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的草稿器（如EAGLE）需要N次顺序传递来生成N个token，限制了推理速度。FastEagle旨在通过消除顺序依赖关系，实现更高效的并行验证。

Method: 使用轻量级层级级联替代时间步骤，通过层级监督训练减轻错误累积，结合约束草稿树保持无损验证成本。

Result: 在多个LLM（Vicuna-13B、LLaMA-Instruct 3.x、DeepSeek-R1-Distill-LLaMA）和任务上，FastEagle在贪婪和随机解码下均优于EAGLE-3，速度提升显著，同时保持可比较的平均接受长度。

Conclusion: 消除草稿生成中的顺序依赖是实现无损LLM推理加速的实用路径。

Abstract: Speculative decoding accelerates generation by drafting candidates and
verifying them in parallel, yet state-of-the-art drafters (e.g., EAGLE) still
require N sequential passes to propose N tokens. We present FastEagle, a
non-autoregressive cascaded drafter that emits an entire draft in a single
forward pass. FastEagle replaces temporal steps with a lightweight layer
cascade and trains with layer-wise supervision to mitigate error accumulation.
Coupled with a constrained draft tree that preserves lossless verification
cost, FastEagle delivers substantial wall-clock speedups over strong
autoregressive drafters while maintaining competitive acceptance behavior.
Across multiple LLMs (Vicuna-13B, LLaMA-Instruct 3.x, and
DeepSeek-R1-Distill-LLaMA) and tasks (MT-Bench, HumanEval, GSM8K, CNN/DM,
Alpaca), FastEagle consistently outperforms EAGLE-3 in speedup under both
greedy and stochastic decoding, with comparable average acceptance lengths.
These results indicate that removing sequential dependencies in drafting is a
practical path toward lossless LLM inference acceleration.

### [4] [mloz: A Highly Efficient Machine Learning-Based Ozone Parameterization for Climate Sensitivity Simulations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20422)
*Yiling Ma,Nathan Luke Abraham,Stefan Versick,Roland Ruhnke,Andrea Schneidereit,Ulrike Niemeier,Felix Back,Peter Braesicke,Peer Nowack*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 开发了一种机器学习参数化方法（mloz）来交互式模拟大气臭氧的日变化和趋势，比传统化学方案快31倍，可在不同气候模型间迁移使用


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大多数CMIP气候模型由于计算成本高而缺乏交互式臭氧表示，这影响了气候敏感性模拟的准确性

Method: 使用机器学习参数化方法，仅需大气温度剖面信息作为输入，在UKESM和ICON两个气候模型中在线实现臭氧交互模拟

Result: mloz在十年时间尺度上表现出高保真度，比UKESM化学方案快31倍，仅占气候模型总运行时间的不到4%，且可在模型间成功迁移

Conclusion: 该方法有潜力在缺乏交互化学的CMIP级气候模型中广泛采用，特别是在关注气候敏感性模拟时，臭氧趋势和变率对大气反馈过程有显著调节作用

Abstract: Atmospheric ozone is a crucial absorber of solar radiation and an important
greenhouse gas. However, most climate models participating in the Coupled Model
Intercomparison Project (CMIP) still lack an interactive representation of
ozone due to the high computational costs of atmospheric chemistry schemes.
Here, we introduce a machine learning parameterization (mloz) to interactively
model daily ozone variability and trends across the troposphere and
stratosphere in standard climate sensitivity simulations, including two-way
interactions of ozone with the Quasi-Biennial Oscillation. We demonstrate its
high fidelity on decadal timescales and its flexible use online across two
different climate models -- the UK Earth System Model (UKESM) and the German
ICOsahedral Nonhydrostatic (ICON) model. With atmospheric temperature profile
information as the only input, mloz produces stable ozone predictions around 31
times faster than the chemistry scheme in UKESM, contributing less than 4
percent of the respective total climate model runtimes. In particular, we also
demonstrate its transferability to different climate models without chemistry
schemes by transferring the parameterization from UKESM to ICON. This
highlights the potential for widespread adoption in CMIP-level climate models
that lack interactive chemistry for future climate change assessments,
particularly when focusing on climate sensitivity simulations, where ozone
trends and variability are known to significantly modulate atmospheric feedback
processes.

### [5] [Bridging Privacy and Utility: Synthesizing anonymized EEG with constraining utility functions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20454)
*Kay Fuhrmeister,Arne Pelzer,Fabian Radke,Julia Lechinger,Mahzad Gharleghi,Thomas Köllmer,Insa Wolf*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出基于transformer的自编码器方法，用于在保护用户隐私的同时保持EEG数据的实用性，特别针对睡眠分期任务进行验证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着EEG消费设备的普及，用户隐私保护需求日益迫切，需要在不影响EEG应用效用的前提下防止主体重识别。

Method: 使用transformer-based autoencoder对EEG数据进行匿名化处理，平衡隐私保护和数据效用。

Result: EEG信号的重识别能力显著降低，同时机器学习的实用性得到保持。

Conclusion: 该方法能有效保护EEG数据隐私，同时维持其在特定机器学习任务中的价值。

Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) is widely used for recording brain activity and
has seen numerous applications in machine learning, such as detecting sleep
stages and neurological disorders. Several studies have successfully shown the
potential of EEG data for re-identification and leakage of other personal
information. Therefore, the increasing availability of EEG consumer devices
raises concerns about user privacy, motivating us to investigate how to
safeguard this sensitive data while retaining its utility for EEG applications.
To address this challenge, we propose a transformer-based autoencoder to create
EEG data that does not allow for subject re-identification while still
retaining its utility for specific machine learning tasks. We apply our
approach to automatic sleep staging by evaluating the re-identification and
utility potential of EEG data before and after anonymization. The results show
that the re-identifiability of the EEG signal can be substantially reduced
while preserving its utility for machine learning.

### [6] [Efficiently Attacking Memorization Scores](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20463)
*Tue Do,Varun Chandrasekaran,Daniel Alabi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文研究了基于记忆化的影响力估计工具在对抗性攻击下的脆弱性，提出了一种实用的攻击方法，并验证了即使是最先进的影响力估计代理也容易受到针对性分数操纵。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着影响力估计工具在数据估值和负责任机器学习中的广泛应用，需要评估这些分数本身是否可能被对抗性操纵，以确保其可靠性和安全性。

Method: 提出了一种计算输入伪逆的实用攻击方法，仅需黑盒访问模型输出，计算开销适中。在多个图像分类任务上进行了实证验证。

Result: 实验表明，即使是最先进的影响力估计代理也容易受到针对性分数操纵，揭示了影响力估计在对抗性扰动下的固有脆弱性。

Conclusion: 研究结果凸显了基于影响力的归因方法存在关键漏洞，强调了开发鲁棒防御措施的必要性。

Abstract: Influence estimation tools -- such as memorization scores -- are widely used
to understand model behavior, attribute training data, and inform dataset
curation. However, recent applications in data valuation and responsible
machine learning raise the question: can these scores themselves be
adversarially manipulated? In this work, we present a systematic study of the
feasibility of attacking memorization-based influence estimators. We
characterize attacks for producing highly memorized samples as highly sensitive
queries in the regime where a trained algorithm is accurate. Our attack
(calculating the pseudoinverse of the input) is practical, requiring only
black-box access to model outputs and incur modest computational overhead. We
empirically validate our attack across a wide suite of image classification
tasks, showing that even state-of-the-art proxies are vulnerable to targeted
score manipulations. In addition, we provide a theoretical analysis of the
stability of memorization scores under adversarial perturbations, revealing
conditions under which influence estimates are inherently fragile. Our findings
highlight critical vulnerabilities in influence-based attribution and suggest
the need for robust defenses. All code can be found at

### [7] [Offline Goal-conditioned Reinforcement Learning with Quasimetric Representations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20478)
*Vivek Myers,Bill Chunyuan Zheng,Benjamin Eysenbach,Sergey Levine*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种统一对比表示和时态距离两种框架的方法，通过准度量表示空间结构和额外约束学习后继表示，实现最优目标达成。该方法能在次优数据和随机环境中学习最优目标达成距离。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的目标条件强化学习（GCRL）方法主要使用对比表示和时态距离两种框架，各有优势但存在局限性。作者希望结合两种方法的优点，开发一个更强大的统一框架。

Method: 使用准度量表示空间结构（三角不等式）配合额外约束来学习后继表示，能够学习最优目标达成距离，即使在次优数据和随机环境中也能保持稳定性。

Result: 在现有离线GCRL基准测试中，该方法在对比学习方法难以处理的拼接任务上表现更好，同时在准度量网络方法难以处理的高维噪声环境中也表现优异。

Conclusion: 该方法成功结合了对比学习和准度量网络的优势，既保持了蒙特卡洛对比RL方法的稳定性和长时程能力，又获得了准度量网络参数化的自由拼接能力。

Abstract: Approaches for goal-conditioned reinforcement learning (GCRL) often use
learned state representations to extract goal-reaching policies. Two frameworks
for representation structure have yielded particularly effective GCRL
algorithms: (1) *contrastive representations*, in which methods learn
"successor features" with a contrastive objective that performs inference over
future outcomes, and (2) *temporal distances*, which link the (quasimetric)
distance in representation space to the transit time from states to goals. We
propose an approach that unifies these two frameworks, using the structure of a
quasimetric representation space (triangle inequality) with the right
additional constraints to learn successor representations that enable optimal
goal-reaching. Unlike past work, our approach is able to exploit a
**quasimetric** distance parameterization to learn **optimal** goal-reaching
distances, even with **suboptimal** data and in **stochastic** environments.
This gives us the best of both worlds: we retain the stability and long-horizon
capabilities of Monte Carlo contrastive RL methods, while getting the free
stitching capabilities of quasimetric network parameterizations. On existing
offline GCRL benchmarks, our representation learning objective improves
performance on stitching tasks where methods based on contrastive learning
struggle, and on noisy, high-dimensional environments where methods based on
quasimetric networks struggle.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出一种新颖的端到端深度学习框架，用于从原始脑电图信号中提取多尺度特征，通过注意力机制和门控网络处理噪声和通道变异性，并在多种中枢神经系统疾病分类任务中验证有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 脑电图信号包含丰富的多尺度信息，但如何从原始EEG信号中提取有意义的特征，同时处理噪声和通道变异性是一个主要挑战。

Method: 设计了一个能够显式捕捉多尺度频率振荡的编码器，引入基于注意力的编码器来建模复杂依赖关系，集成门控网络动态过滤噪声通道，并使用结合监督和对比学习的新型损失函数。

Result: 在多种中枢神经系统疾病治疗效果的分类以及帕金森病和阿尔茨海默病的诊断等应用中验证了方法的有效性，能够从不同物种的原始EEG信号中提取生物学有意义的模式。

Conclusion: 提出的学习范式能够自主选择高质量通道，通过创新的架构和损失设计实现鲁棒的泛化能力，为EEG相关任务提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Electroencephalography signals (EEGs) contain rich multi-scale information
crucial for understanding brain states, with potential applications in
diagnosing and advancing the drug development landscape. However, extracting
meaningful features from raw EEG signals while handling noise and channel
variability remains a major challenge. This work proposes a novel end-to-end
deep-learning framework that addresses these issues through several key
innovations. First, we designed an encoder capable of explicitly capturing
multi-scale frequency oscillations covering a wide range of features for
different EEG-related tasks. Secondly, to model complex dependencies and handle
the high temporal resolution of EEGs, we introduced an attention-based encoder
that simultaneously learns interactions across EEG channels and within
localized {\em patches} of individual channels. We integrated a dedicated
gating network on top of the attention encoder to dynamically filter out noisy
and non-informative channels, enhancing the reliability of EEG data. The entire
encoding process is guided by a novel loss function, which leverages supervised
and contrastive learning, significantly improving model generalization. We
validated our approach in multiple applications, ranging from the
classification of effects across multiple Central Nervous System (CNS)
disorders treatments to the diagnosis of Parkinson's and Alzheimer's disease.
Our results demonstrate that the proposed learning paradigm can extract
biologically meaningful patterns from raw EEG signals across different species,
autonomously select high-quality channels, and achieve robust generalization
through innovative architectural and loss design.

*Kishor Datta Gupta,Mohd Ariful Haque,Marufa Kamal,Ahmed Rafi Hasan,Md. Mahfuzur Rahman,Roy George*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DARTVAE是一种结合领域特定规则的变分自编码器聚类框架，通过将显式规则、语义表示和数据特征整合到统一潜在空间中，实现更有意义的聚类结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统聚类方法仅依赖输入数据的相似性，无法捕捉领域特定的结构或语义约束，限制了在复杂领域中的应用效果。

Method: 扩展VAE架构，嵌入LLM生成的规则（结构化知识图谱），在损失函数中结合重构损失、KL散度、规则一致性和违反惩罚，将规则作为一等学习信号。

Result: 在飞机和汽车数据集上的实验表明，规则引导的聚类产生更具操作意义和可解释性的聚类（如分离无人机、统一隐形飞机、区分SUV和轿车），同时改进了传统聚类指标。

Conclusion: DARTVAE通过结合规则编码和学习表示，比纯数据驱动模型实现更有意义和一致的聚类结果，但面临LLM规则幻觉、规则冲突、过拟合和计算复杂性等挑战。

Abstract: Traditional clustering techniques often rely solely on similarity in the
input data, limiting their ability to capture structural or semantic
constraints that are critical in many domains. We introduce the Domain Aware
Rule Triggered Variational Autoencoder (DARTVAE), a rule guided multimodal
clustering framework that incorporates domain specific constraints directly
into the representation learning process. DARTVAE extends the VAE architecture
by embedding explicit rules, semantic representations, and data driven features
into a unified latent space, while enforcing constraint compliance through rule
consistency and violation penalties in the loss function. Unlike conventional
clustering methods that rely only on visual similarity or apply rules as post
hoc filters, DARTVAE treats rules as first class learning signals. The rules
are generated by LLMs, structured into knowledge graphs, and enforced through a
loss function combining reconstruction, KL divergence, consistency, and
violation penalties. Experiments on aircraft and automotive datasets
demonstrate that rule guided clustering produces more operationally meaningful
and interpretable clusters for example, isolating UAVs, unifying stealth
aircraft, or separating SUVs from sedans while improving traditional clustering
metrics. However, the framework faces challenges: LLM generated rules may
hallucinate or conflict, excessive rules risk overfitting, and scaling to
complex domains increases computational and consistency difficulties. By
combining rule encodings with learned representations, DARTVAE achieves more
meaningful and consistent clustering outcomes than purely data driven models,
highlighting the utility of constraint guided multimodal clustering for
complex, knowledge intensive settings.

*Evgenii Egorov,Hanno Ackermann,Markus Nagel,Hong Cai*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出一种基于树结构矩阵高效求逆的新算法，结合了注意力机制和状态空间模型的优势，解决序列长度二次方复杂度问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 注意力层在没有结构假设时，内存和计算随序列长度呈二次方增长。现有方法（引入稀疏性或循环依赖）各有缺点，需要结合两者优势。

Method: 通过树结构矩阵的高效求逆算法，将注意力机制与状态空间模型（SSM）的优点相结合。

Result: 提出了一种新颖的算法框架，能够有效处理长序列的二次方复杂度问题。

Conclusion: 该算法为长序列处理提供了新的解决方案，结合了稀疏性和循环依赖方法的优势。

Abstract: Attention layers apply a sequence-to-sequence mapping whose parameters depend
on the pairwise interactions of the input elements. However, without any
structural assumptions, memory and compute scale quadratically with the
sequence length. The two main ways to mitigate this are to introduce sparsity
by ignoring a sufficient amount of pairwise interactions or to introduce
recurrent dependence along them, as SSM does. Although both approaches are
reasonable, they both have disadvantages. We propose a novel algorithm that
combines the advantages of both concepts. Our idea is based on the efficient
inversion of tree-structured matrices.

*Liya Gaynutdinova,Petr Havlásek,Ondřej Rokoš,Fleur Hendriks,Martin Doškář*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种深度学习方法来预测混凝土中时间相关的全场损伤。研究使用自回归U-Net模型，在给定微观结构几何形状和施加收缩剖面演化的条件下，预测单元中标量损伤场的演化。通过将预测的损伤输出作为后续预测的输入，模型能够连续评估损伤进展。此外，还使用卷积神经网络（CNN）利用损伤估计来预测关键力学性能，包括观察到的收缩和残余刚度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统全场损伤评估计算量大，需要一种更高效的方法来预测混凝土损伤进展，并深入了解骨料特性（如形状、大小和分布）与有效收缩和刚度降低之间的关系，从而优化混凝土配合比设计。

Method: 采用双网络架构：自回归U-Net模型用于预测损伤场演化，CNN用于基于损伤估计预测力学性能。模型通过顺序使用预测输出作为后续输入来实现连续损伤评估。

Result: 所提出的方法在合成数据集上表现出高计算效率和稳健的预测性能，显著降低了传统全场损伤评估的计算负荷。

Conclusion: 该方法有助于优化混凝土配合比设计，提高耐久性并减少内部损伤，为混凝土材料性能预测提供了有效的计算工具。

Abstract: This paper introduces a deep learning approach for predicting time-dependent
full-field damage in concrete. The study uses an auto-regressive U-Net model to
predict the evolution of the scalar damage field in a unit cell given
microstructural geometry and evolution of an imposed shrinkage profile. By
sequentially using the predicted damage output as input for subsequent
predictions, the model facilitates the continuous assessment of damage
progression. Complementarily, a convolutional neural network (CNN) utilises the
damage estimations to forecast key mechanical properties, including observed
shrinkage and residual stiffness. The proposed dual-network architecture
demonstrates high computational efficiency and robust predictive performance on
the synthesised datasets. The approach reduces the computational load
traditionally associated with full-field damage evaluations and is used to gain
insights into the relationship between aggregate properties, such as shape,
size, and distribution, and the effective shrinkage and reduction in stiffness.
Ultimately, this can help to optimize concrete mix designs, leading to improved
durability and reduced internal damage.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决用户在超级计算机上运行昂贵的耦合簇方法等化学计算时面临的两个关键问题：如何找到最短执行时间的配置和如何最小化资源使用成本。

Method: 评估了一系列机器学习模型和策略，基于在DOE Frontier和Aurora超级计算机上收集的CCSD应用运行时参数值。使用梯度提升模型预测执行时间，并探索主动学习方法在数据收集成本高的情况下的应用。

Result: 梯度提升模型在预测CCSD迭代总执行时间时，在Aurora和Frontier上分别达到0.023和0.073的MAPE。主动学习方法仅需约450个实验就能达到约0.2的MAPE。

Conclusion: 机器学习方法能够有效预测化学计算资源需求，梯度提升模型表现优异，主动学习方法在数据稀缺情况下具有实用价值，为超级计算机用户提供了可靠的资源规划工具。

Abstract: In this work, we develop machine learning (ML) based strategies to predict
resources (costs) required for massively parallel chemistry computations, such
as coupled-cluster methods, to guide application users before they commit to
running expensive experiments on a supercomputer. By predicting application
execution time, we determine the optimal runtime parameter values such as
number of nodes and tile sizes. Two key questions of interest to users are
addressed. The first is the shortest-time question, where the user is
interested in knowing the parameter configurations (number of nodes and tile
sizes) to achieve the shortest execution time for a given problem size and a
target supercomputer. The second is the cheapest-run question in which the user
is interested in minimizing resource usage, i.e., finding the number of nodes
and tile size that minimizes the number of node-hours for a given problem size.
  We evaluate a rich family of ML models and strategies, developed based on the
collections of runtime parameter values for the CCSD (Coupled Cluster with
Singles and Doubles) application executed on the Department of Energy (DOE)
Frontier and Aurora supercomputers. Our experiments show that when predicting
the total execution time of a CCSD iteration, a Gradient Boosting (GB) ML model
achieves a Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) of 0.023 and 0.073 for Aurora
and Frontier, respectively. In the case where it is expensive to run
experiments just to collect data points, we show that active learning can
achieve a MAPE of about 0.2 with just around 450 experiments collected from
Aurora and Frontier.

*Luca Serfilippi,Giorgio Franceschelli,Antonio Corradi,Mirco Musolesi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出用复杂度奖励替代熵奖励的新算法CDPO，通过平衡随机性和结构化来改进策略梯度方法的探索效率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的熵最大化方法将策略推向均匀随机分布，这种探索策略缺乏结构且效率低下，需要更鲁棒的探索机制

Method: 基于PPO框架，引入复杂度奖励（熵与不平衡度的乘积），创建CDPO算法，抑制完全无序和完全有序的极端情况

Result: 在离散动作空间任务中，CDPO对复杂度系数的鲁棒性优于PPO对熵系数的鲁棒性，特别是在需要更多探索的环境中表现更好

Conclusion: 复杂度奖励能够引导智能体发现结构化且适应性强的策略，比传统熵奖励更有效地平衡探索与利用

Abstract: Policy gradient methods often balance exploitation and exploration via
entropy maximization. However, maximizing entropy pushes the policy towards a
uniform random distribution, which represents an unstructured and sometimes
inefficient exploration strategy. In this work, we propose replacing the
entropy bonus with a more robust complexity bonus. In particular, we adopt a
measure of complexity, defined as the product of Shannon entropy and
disequilibrium, where the latter quantifies the distance from the uniform
distribution. This regularizer encourages policies that balance stochasticity
(high entropy) with structure (high disequilibrium), guiding agents toward
regimes where useful, non-trivial behaviors can emerge. Such behaviors arise
because the regularizer suppresses both extremes, e.g., maximal disorder and
complete order, creating pressure for agents to discover structured yet
adaptable strategies. Starting from Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), we
introduce Complexity-Driven Policy Optimization (CDPO), a new learning
algorithm that replaces entropy with complexity. We show empirically across a
range of discrete action space tasks that CDPO is more robust to the choice of
the complexity coefficient than PPO is with the entropy coefficient, especially
in environments requiring greater exploration.

TL;DR: GWTF是第一个具有容错性的实用去中心化大语言模型训练框架，能够在异构客户端上实现高效协作训练，并解决节点流失和网络不稳定问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 受大语言模型兴起和训练民主化重要性的驱动，需要开发能够支持异构客户端自愿贡献资源的去中心化训练框架。

Method: GWTF采用新颖的去中心化流算法，找到最有效的路由以最大化微批次训练数量并最小化延迟。

Result: 在涉及10个不同地理位置的异构客户端节点和高节点流失率的挑战性场景中，GWTF将训练时间减少了高达45%。

Conclusion: GWTF是首个实用的容错去中心化LLM训练框架，在现实挑战性场景中显著优于现有技术。

Abstract: Motivated by the emergence of large language models (LLMs) and the importance
of democratizing their training, we propose GWTF, the first crash tolerant
practical decentralized training framework for LLMs. Differently from existing
distributed and federated training frameworks, GWTF enables the efficient
collaborative training of a LLM on heterogeneous clients that volunteer their
resources. In addition, GWTF addresses node churn, i.e., clients joining or
leaving the system at any time, and network instabilities, i.e., network links
becoming unstable or unreliable. The core of GWTF is a novel decentralized flow
algorithm that finds the most effective routing that maximizes the number of
microbatches trained with the lowest possible delay. We extensively evaluate
GWTF on GPT-like and LLaMa-like models and compare it against the prior art.
Our results indicate that GWTF reduces the training time by up to 45% in
realistic and challenging scenarios that involve heterogeneous client nodes
distributed over 10 different geographic locations with a high node churn rate.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然生成扩散模型在逆问题中表现出强大的数据驱动先验能力，但缺乏严格的理论恢复保证。本文旨在为基于扩散的逆问题求解算法提供理论分析框架。

Method: 开发理论框架分析确定性扩散算法，将噪声卷积分数解释为时变投影，将扩散先验算法建模为广义投影梯度下降，并在满足限制等距性质的传感矩阵下推导收敛率。

Result: 证明了当数据分布集中在低维模型集时，算法具有定量收敛率，并成功应用于低维紧凸集和低秩高斯混合模型等数据分布。

Conclusion: 该框架为扩散模型在逆问题中的应用提供了理论支撑，即使在非凸模型集下也能建立全局收敛保证，扩展了扩散先验的理论基础。

Abstract: Recovering high-dimensional signals from corrupted measurements is a central
challenge in inverse problems. Recent advances in generative diffusion models
have shown remarkable empirical success in providing strong data-driven priors,
but rigorous recovery guarantees remain limited. In this work, we develop a
theoretical framework for analyzing deterministic diffusion-based algorithms
for inverse problems, focusing on a deterministic version of the algorithm
proposed by Kadkhodaie \& Simoncelli \cite{kadkhodaie2021stochastic}. First, we
show that when the underlying data distribution concentrates on a
low-dimensional model set, the associated noise-convolved scores can be
interpreted as time-varying projections onto such a set. This leads to
interpreting previous algorithms using diffusion priors for inverse problems as
generalized projected gradient descent methods with varying projections. When
the sensing matrix satisfies a restricted isometry property over the model set,
we can derive quantitative convergence rates that depend explicitly on the
noise schedule. We apply our framework to two instructive data distributions:
uniform distributions over low-dimensional compact, convex sets and low-rank
Gaussian mixture models. In the latter setting, we can establish global
convergence guarantees despite the nonconvexity of the underlying model set.

*Xinyu Lian,Masahiro Tanaka,Olatunji Ruwase,Minjia Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了SuperOffload系统，针对Superchip异构架构优化LLM训练，通过自适应权重卸载、存储桶重新分区等技术，在单个Superchip上实现25B模型训练，相比现有系统提升2.5倍吞吐量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Superchip作为新一代AI硬件，集成了GPU和CPU的紧密耦合架构，但现有研究尚未充分探索LLM训练如何受益于此架构。传统卸载方案基于松散耦合架构的假设，不适用于Superchip。

Method: SuperOffload系统结合自适应权重卸载、存储桶重新分区、Superchip感知类型转换、推测执行等技术，并针对Grace CPU优化Adam优化器，充分利用Hopper GPU、Grace CPU和NVLink-C2C互连。

Result: 在NVIDIA GH200上的评估显示，SuperOffload相比最先进的卸载系统实现2.5倍吞吐量提升，单个Superchip可训练25B模型。扩展到8个GH200时，可训练13B模型并支持100万token序列长度，达到55% MFU。

Conclusion: SuperOffload证明了Superchip架构在LLM训练中的巨大潜力，为下一代AI硬件上的高效模型训练提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: The emergence of Superchips represents a significant advancement in
next-generation AI hardware. These Superchips employ a tightly coupled
heterogeneous architecture that integrates GPU and CPU on the same package,
which offers unprecedented computational power. However, there has been scant
research investigating how LLM training benefits from this new architecture. In
this work, for the first time, we study LLM training solutions based on
offloading for Superchips. We observe important differences between Superchips
and traditional loosely-coupled GPU-CPU architecture, which necessitate
revisiting prevailing assumptions about offloading. Based on that, we present
SuperOffload, a Superchip-centric offloading system that simultaneously uses
Hopper GPU, Grace CPU, and NVLink-C2C interconnect more efficiently.
SuperOffload accomplishes this via a combination of techniques, such as
adaptive weight offloading, bucketization repartitioning, Superchip-aware
casting, speculative execution, and a highly optimized Adam optimizer for Grace
CPUs. Our evaluation of SuperOffload on NVIDIA GH200 demonstrates up to 2.5x
throughput improvement compared to state-of-the-art offloading-based systems,
enabling training of up to 25B model on a single Superchip while achieving high
training throughput. We also extend SuperOffload with ZeRO-style data
parallelism and DeepSpeed-Ulysses sequence parallelism, enabling training of
13B model with sequence lengths up to 1 million tokens on 8 GH200 while
achieving 55% MFU.

TL;DR: MDBench是一个开源基准测试框架，用于评估动态系统的模型发现方法，评估了12种算法在14个偏微分方程和63个常微分方程上的表现，发现线性方法和遗传编程方法分别在PDE和ODE上表现最佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前缺乏针对动态模型发现的全面基准测试，现有研究主要关注单一方程的识别，需要系统评估模型发现方法的性能。

Method: 开发MDBench框架，在噪声条件下评估12种算法在14个PDE和63个ODE上的表现，使用导数预测精度、模型复杂度和方程保真度等指标。

Result: 线性方法在PDE上误差最低，遗传编程在ODE上表现最佳；线性模型对噪声更具鲁棒性；当前方法在处理流体动力学和热力学等复杂PDE系统时存在局限。

Conclusion: MDBench通过提供严谨可扩展的基准测试框架和丰富的动态系统数据集，加速模型发现方法的发展，支持系统性评估和改进方程精度与鲁棒性。

Abstract: Model discovery aims to uncover governing differential equations of dynamical
systems directly from experimental data. Benchmarking such methods is essential
for tracking progress and understanding trade-offs in the field. While prior
efforts have focused mostly on identifying single equations, typically framed
as symbolic regression, there remains a lack of comprehensive benchmarks for
discovering dynamical models. To address this, we introduce MDBench, an
open-source benchmarking framework for evaluating model discovery methods on
dynamical systems. MDBench assesses 12 algorithms on 14 partial differential
equations (PDEs) and 63 ordinary differential equations (ODEs) under varying
levels of noise. Evaluation metrics include derivative prediction accuracy,
model complexity, and equation fidelity. We also introduce seven challenging
PDE systems from fluid dynamics and thermodynamics, revealing key limitations
in current methods. Our findings illustrate that linear methods and genetic
programming methods achieve the lowest prediction error for PDEs and ODEs,
respectively. Moreover, linear models are in general more robust against noise.
MDBench accelerates the advancement of model discovery methods by offering a
rigorous, extensible benchmarking framework and a rich, diverse collection of
dynamical system datasets, enabling systematic evaluation, comparison, and
improvement of equation accuracy and robustness.

### [18] [Understanding and Improving Adversarial Robustness of Neural Probabilistic Circuits](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20549)
*Weixin Chen,Han Zhao*

TL;DR: 本文分析了神经概率电路（NPC）的对抗鲁棒性，并提出了一种新的鲁棒神经概率电路（RNPC）来抵御对抗攻击。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: NPC虽然提供了增强的可解释性和高性能，但其基于神经网络的属性识别模型仍然是黑盒，容易受到对抗攻击的影响，可能危及最终预测。

Method: 提出了RNPC，通过引入新颖的类级集成推理方法，确保两个模块输出的鲁棒组合。

Result: 理论分析表明RNPC相比NPC具有可证明的对抗鲁棒性提升。在图像分类任务上的实证结果显示，RNPC在保持良性输入高准确率的同时，相比现有概念瓶颈模型具有更优的对抗鲁棒性。

Conclusion: RNPC是第一个针对识别模块对抗攻击的鲁棒神经概率电路，在保持可解释性的同时显著提升了模型的对抗鲁棒性。

Abstract: Neural Probabilistic Circuits (NPCs), a new class of concept bottleneck
models, comprise an attribute recognition model and a probabilistic circuit for
reasoning. By integrating the outputs from these two modules, NPCs produce
compositional and interpretable predictions. While offering enhanced
interpretability and high performance on downstream tasks, the
neural-network-based attribute recognition model remains a black box. This
vulnerability allows adversarial attacks to manipulate attribute predictions by
introducing carefully crafted subtle perturbations to input images, potentially
compromising the final predictions. In this paper, we theoretically analyze the
adversarial robustness of NPC and demonstrate that it only depends on the
robustness of the attribute recognition model and is independent of the
robustness of the probabilistic circuit. Moreover, we propose RNPC, the first
robust neural probabilistic circuit against adversarial attacks on the
recognition module. RNPC introduces a novel class-wise integration for
inference, ensuring a robust combination of outputs from the two modules. Our
theoretical analysis demonstrates that RNPC exhibits provably improved
adversarial robustness compared to NPC. Empirical results on image
classification tasks show that RNPC achieves superior adversarial robustness
compared to existing concept bottleneck models while maintaining high accuracy
on benign inputs.

*Athar Parvez,Muhammad Jawad Mufti*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本研究比较了两种混合机器学习分类器（XGBoost+随机森林 vs SVM+逻辑回归）在糖尿病风险分层中的性能，并在外部验证集上评估其泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 糖尿病影响全球超过5.37亿人，预计到2045年将达到7.83亿人。早期风险分层可以从机器学习中受益，需要评估不同混合分类器的泛化性能。

Method: 构建两种混合分类器：XGBoost+随机森林（XGB-RF）和支持向量机+逻辑回归（SVM-LR）。采用防泄漏的标准化流程，包括编码、插补、最小-最大缩放、仅在训练折叠上使用SMOTE、SVM概率校准。在主要数据集上拟合并冻结流程，在PIMA队列（N=768）上进行外部验证。

Result: 在主要数据集上，XGB-RF（AUROC ~0.995；AUPRC ~0.998）优于SVM-LR（AUROC ~0.978；AUPRC ~0.947）。在PIMA外部验证集上，XGB-RF保持强劲性能（AUROC ~0.990；AUPRC ~0.959），而SVM-LR性能较低（AUROC ~0.963；AUPRC ~0.875）。

Conclusion: XGB-RF在内部和外部队列中始终优于SVM-LR，在ROC/PR上表现出较小的外部衰减和可接受的校准。这些结果支持基于梯度提升的混合方法作为糖尿病风险分层的稳健、可转移方法，并推动基于临床权衡的前瞻性多中心验证和部署时阈值选择。

Abstract: Background/Purpose: Diabetes affects over 537 million people worldwide and is
projected to reach 783 million by 2045. Early risk stratification can benefit
from machine learning. We compare two hybrid classifiers and assess their
generalizability on an external cohort.
  Methods: Two hybrids were built: (i) XGBoost + Random Forest (XGB-RF) and
(ii) Support Vector Machine + Logistic Regression (SVM-LR). A leakage-safe,
standardized pipeline (encoding, imputation, min-max scaling; SMOTE on training
folds only; probability calibration for SVM) was fit on the primary dataset and
frozen. Evaluation prioritized threshold-independent discrimination
(AUROC/AUPRC) and calibration (Brier, slope/intercept). External validation
used the PIMA cohort (N=768) with the frozen pipeline; any thresholded metrics
on PIMA were computed at the default rule tau = 0.5.
  Results: On the primary dataset (PR baseline = 0.50), XGB-RF achieved AUROC
~0.995 and AUPRC ~0.998, outperforming SVM-LR (AUROC ~0.978; AUPRC ~0.947). On
PIMA (PR baseline ~0.349), XGB-RF retained strong performance (AUROC ~0.990;
AUPRC ~0.959); SVM-LR was lower (AUROC ~0.963; AUPRC ~0.875). Thresholded
metrics on PIMA at tau = 0.5 were XGB-RF (Accuracy 0.960; Precision 0.941;
Recall 0.944; F1 0.942) and SVM-LR (Accuracy 0.900; Precision 0.855; Recall
0.858; F1 0.857).
  Conclusions: Across internal and external cohorts, XGB-RF consistently
dominated SVM-LR and exhibited smaller external attenuation on ROC/PR with
acceptable calibration. These results support gradient-boosting-based
hybridization as a robust, transferable approach for diabetes risk
stratification and motivate prospective, multi-site validation with
deployment-time threshold selection based on clinical trade-offs.

*Mingze Yuan,Pengfei Jin,Na Li,Quanzheng Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了PIRF方法，通过将物理约束生成建模为稀疏奖励优化问题，直接计算轨迹级奖励并反向传播梯度，避免了传统DPS方法中的值函数近似误差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型在科学领域生成能力强，但常违反物理定律。现有方法依赖DPS式值函数近似，存在误差大、训练不稳定和推理效率低的问题。

Method: PIRF方法：1）层间截断反向传播利用物理奖励的时空局部性；2）基于权重的正则化方案比传统蒸馏方法更高效。

Result: 在五个PDE基准测试中，PIRF在高效采样机制下始终实现更好的物理约束执行效果。

Conclusion: 奖励微调方法在推进科学生成建模方面具有巨大潜力。

Abstract: Diffusion models have demonstrated strong generative capabilities across
scientific domains, but often produce outputs that violate physical laws. We
propose a new perspective by framing physics-informed generation as a sparse
reward optimization problem, where adherence to physical constraints is treated
as a reward signal. This formulation unifies prior approaches under a
reward-based paradigm and reveals a shared bottleneck: reliance on diffusion
posterior sampling (DPS)-style value function approximations, which introduce
non-negligible errors and lead to training instability and inference
inefficiency. To overcome this, we introduce Physics-Informed Reward
Fine-tuning (PIRF), a method that bypasses value approximation by computing
trajectory-level rewards and backpropagating their gradients directly. However,
a naive implementation suffers from low sample efficiency and compromised data
fidelity. PIRF mitigates these issues through two key strategies: (1) a
layer-wise truncated backpropagation method that leverages the spatiotemporally
localized nature of physics-based rewards, and (2) a weight-based
regularization scheme that improves efficiency over traditional
distillation-based methods. Across five PDE benchmarks, PIRF consistently
achieves superior physical enforcement under efficient sampling regimes,
highlighting the potential of reward fine-tuning for advancing scientific
generative modeling.

### [21] [The Sensitivity of Variational Bayesian Neural Network Performance to Hyperparameters](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20574)
*Scott Koermer,Natalie Klein*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文对贝叶斯神经网络（BNNs）的超参数选择进行了全局敏感性分析，揭示了超参数之间的相互作用对预测准确性和不确定性量化（UQ）的影响，并建议使用全局敏感性分析或贝叶斯优化来改进BNNs在实际应用中的使用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 贝叶斯神经网络在科学应用中需要准确的不确定性量化，但实际中由于训练近似和超参数选择困难，难以获得准确的UQ。超参数数量多且影响不透明，因此需要研究超参数选择对BNN性能的影响。

Method: 采用全局敏感性分析方法，在不同超参数设置下评估BNN的性能，分析超参数之间的相互作用对预测准确性和UQ的影响。

Result: 研究表明，许多超参数之间存在相互作用，共同影响预测准确性和UQ。超参数的选择对BNN性能有显著影响。

Conclusion: 为了在实际应用中改进BNNs的使用，应使用全局敏感性分析或贝叶斯优化等方法进行维度缩减和超参数选择，以确保BNNs能够提供准确的UQ。

Abstract: In scientific applications, predictive modeling is often of limited use
without accurate uncertainty quantification (UQ) to indicate when a model may
be extrapolating or when more data needs to be collected. Bayesian Neural
Networks (BNNs) produce predictive uncertainty by propagating uncertainty in
neural network (NN) weights and offer the promise of obtaining not only an
accurate predictive model but also accurate UQ. However, in practice, obtaining
accurate UQ with BNNs is difficult due in part to the approximations used for
practical model training and in part to the need to choose a suitable set of
hyperparameters; these hyperparameters outnumber those needed for traditional
NNs and often have opaque effects on the results. We aim to shed light on the
effects of hyperparameter choices for BNNs by performing a global sensitivity
analysis of BNN performance under varying hyperparameter settings. Our results
indicate that many of the hyperparameters interact with each other to affect
both predictive accuracy and UQ. For improved usage of BNNs in real-world
applications, we suggest that global sensitivity analysis, or related methods
such as Bayesian optimization, should be used to aid in dimensionality
reduction and selection of hyperparameters to ensure accurate UQ in BNNs.

Conclusion: 该工作成功地将FMM的数学原理与深度学习相结合，为求解N体问题和PDE提供了新的高效计算框架。

Abstract: The Fast Multipole Method (FMM) is an efficient numerical algorithm for
computation of long-ranged forces in $N$-body problems within gravitational and
electrostatic fields. This method utilizes multipole expansions of the Green's
function inherent to the underlying dynamical systems. Despite its widespread
application in physics and engineering, the integration of FMM with modern
machine learning architectures remains underexplored. In this work, we propose
a novel neural network architecture, the Neural FMM, that integrates the
information flow of the FMM into a hierarchical machine learning framework for
learning the Green's operator of an Elliptic PDE. Our Neural FMM architecture
leverages a hierarchical computation flow of the FMM method to split up the
local and far-field interactions and efficiently learn their respective
representations.

Abstract: Quality of Experience (QoE) modeling is crucial for optimizing video
streaming services to capture the complex relationships between different
features and user experience. We propose a novel approach to QoE modeling in
video streaming applications using interpretable Machine Learning (ML)
techniques over raw time series data. Unlike traditional black-box approaches,
our method combines Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) as an interpretable
readout on top of compact frequency-domain features, allowing us to capture
temporal information while retaining a transparent and explainable model. We
evaluate our method on popular datasets and demonstrate its enhanced accuracy
in QoE prediction, while offering transparency and interpretability.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种新型稳定、近似可逆的Runge-Kutta方案（EES方案），用于解决神经SDE求解器的内存效率和梯度精度问题，克服了现有可逆求解器的不稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统神经SDE求解器的反向传播存在两难选择：离散化后优化方法内存成本高，优化后离散化方法梯度近似误差大。现有代数可逆求解器虽然承诺内存效率和梯度精度，但在复杂模型和大步长下不稳定。

Method: 开发了显式且有效对称（EES）的Runge-Kutta方案，这些方案保留了可逆求解器的优点，同时通过稳定性改进克服了其不稳定性问题。

Result: 数值实验表明，EES方案在稳定性和可靠性方面表现优越，能够在不受步长或模型复杂性严重限制的情况下实现内存高效训练。

Conclusion: EES方案为神经SDE的可扩展和精确训练提供了实用的基础，解决了传统方法在内存成本和梯度精度之间的权衡问题。

Abstract: Backpropagation through (neural) SDE solvers is traditionally approached in
two ways: discretise-then-optimise, which offers accurate gradients but incurs
prohibitive memory costs due to storing the full computational graph (even when
mitigated by checkpointing); and optimise-then-discretise, which achieves
constant memory cost by solving an auxiliary backward SDE, but suffers from
slower evaluation and gradient approximation errors. Algebraically reversible
solvers promise both memory efficiency and gradient accuracy, yet existing
methods such as the Reversible Heun scheme are often unstable under complex
models and large step sizes. We address these limitations by introducing a
novel class of stable, near-reversible Runge--Kutta schemes for neural SDEs.
These Explicit and Effectively Symmetric (EES) schemes retain the benefits of
reversible solvers while overcoming their instability, enabling
memory-efficient training without severe restrictions on step size or model
complexity. Through numerical experiments, we demonstrate the superior
stability and reliability of our schemes, establishing them as a practical
foundation for scalable and accurate training of neural SDEs.

Abstract: Function encoders are a recent technique that learn neural network basis
functions to form compact, adaptive representations of Hilbert spaces of
functions. We show that function encoders provide a principled connection to
feature learning and kernel methods by defining a kernel through an inner
product of the learned feature map. This kernel-theoretic perspective explains
their ability to scale independently of dataset size while adapting to the
intrinsic structure of data, and it enables kernel-style analysis of neural
models. Building on this foundation, we develop two training algorithms that
learn compact bases: a progressive training approach that constructively grows
bases, and a train-then-prune approach that offers a computationally efficient
alternative after training. Both approaches use principles from PCA to reveal
the intrinsic dimension of the learned space. In parallel, we derive
finite-sample generalization bounds using Rademacher complexity and PAC-Bayes
techniques, providing inference time guarantees. We validate our approach on a
polynomial benchmark with a known intrinsic dimension, and on nonlinear
dynamical systems including a Van der Pol oscillator and a two-body orbital
model, demonstrating that the same accuracy can be achieved with substantially
fewer basis functions. This work suggests a path toward neural predictors with
kernel-level guarantees, enabling adaptable models that are both efficient and
principled at scale.

Motivation: 互信息是衡量随机变量关系的重要指标，但复杂系统中的互信息估计具有挑战性。去噪扩散模型在密度估计方面表现出色，因此探索其是否也能改进互信息估计。

Method: 利用扩散模型的信息论框架，将互信息对应为条件与无条件扩散的最小均方误差差距在所有信噪比上的积分，并采用自适应重要性采样实现可扩展的估计。

Result: 该方法不仅通过了自一致性测试，而且在性能上超越了传统的和基于分数的扩散互信息估计器，即使在高互信息情况下仍保持强劲表现。

Conclusion: 扩散模型为互信息估计提供了一种直接有效的方法，通过信息论框架将互信息与扩散过程的最小均方误差联系起来，实现了可扩展且高性能的估计。

Abstract: Mutual information (MI) is one of the most general ways to measure
relationships between random variables, but estimating this quantity for
complex systems is challenging. Denoising diffusion models have recently set a
new bar for density estimation, so it is natural to consider whether these
methods could also be used to improve MI estimation. Using the recently
introduced information-theoretic formulation of denoising diffusion models, we
show the diffusion models can be used in a straightforward way to estimate MI.
In particular, the MI corresponds to half the gap in the Minimum Mean Square
Error (MMSE) between conditional and unconditional diffusion, integrated over
all Signal-to-Noise-Ratios (SNRs) in the noising process. Our approach not only
passes self-consistency tests but also outperforms traditional and score-based
diffusion MI estimators. Furthermore, our method leverages adaptive importance
sampling to achieve scalable MI estimation, while maintaining strong
performance even when the MI is high.

Conclusion: SIL-C框架成功解决了技能增量学习中的兼容性问题，为构建可重用和可泛化的分层策略提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Skill Incremental Learning (SIL) is the process by which an embodied agent
expands and refines its skill set over time by leveraging experience gained
through interaction with its environment or by the integration of additional
data. SIL facilitates efficient acquisition of hierarchical policies grounded
in reusable skills for downstream tasks. However, as the skill repertoire
evolves, it can disrupt compatibility with existing skill-based policies,
limiting their reusability and generalization. In this work, we propose SIL-C,
a novel framework that ensures skill-policy compatibility, allowing
improvements in incrementally learned skills to enhance the performance of
downstream policies without requiring policy re-training or structural
adaptation. SIL-C employs a bilateral lazy learning-based mapping technique to
dynamically align the subtask space referenced by policies with the skill space
decoded into agent behaviors. This enables each subtask, derived from the
policy's decomposition of a complex task, to be executed by selecting an
appropriate skill based on trajectory distribution similarity. We evaluate
SIL-C across diverse SIL scenarios and demonstrate that it maintains
compatibility between evolving skills and downstream policies while ensuring
efficiency throughout the learning process.

Motivation: 科学机器学习在复杂系统分析、建模和预测方面取得了进展，但表示学习和算法求解方法往往平行发展。需要一种统一的框架来弥合数据驱动的表示学习和传统科学建模之间的鸿沟。

Method: Latent Twins框架在潜在空间中为底层方程创建隐藏代理，通过学习的潜在空间中的算子来镜像数学系统。该框架将经典建模、反演、模型约简和算子逼近统一为单一原理的特殊情况。

Result: 在三个代表性场景中验证：1）典型ODE捕捉不同动态机制；2）浅水方程PDE基准测试，与DeepONet和4D-Var基线对比；3）真实地理位势再分析数据集，从稀疏噪声观测中重建和预测。Latent Twins提供了紧凑、可解释的解决方案算子代理。

Conclusion: Latent Twins提供了可扩展、理论基础的代理模型，弥合了数据驱动表示学习和跨学科经典科学建模之间的差距，与同化、控制和不确定性量化等科学流程兼容。

Abstract: Over the past decade, scientific machine learning has transformed the
development of mathematical and computational frameworks for analyzing,
modeling, and predicting complex systems. From inverse problems to numerical
PDEs, dynamical systems, and model reduction, these advances have pushed the
boundaries of what can be simulated. Yet they have often progressed in
parallel, with representation learning and algorithmic solution methods
evolving largely as separate pipelines. With \emph{Latent Twins}, we propose a
unifying mathematical framework that creates a hidden surrogate in latent space
for the underlying equations. Whereas digital twins mirror physical systems in
the digital world, Latent Twins mirror mathematical systems in a learned latent
space governed by operators. Through this lens, classical modeling, inversion,
model reduction, and operator approximation all emerge as special cases of a
single principle. We establish the fundamental approximation properties of
Latent Twins for both ODEs and PDEs and demonstrate the framework across three
representative settings: (i) canonical ODEs, capturing diverse dynamical
regimes; (ii) a PDE benchmark using the shallow-water equations, contrasting
Latent Twin simulations with DeepONet and forecasts with a 4D-Var baseline; and
(iii) a challenging real-data geopotential reanalysis dataset, reconstructing
and forecasting from sparse, noisy observations. Latent Twins provide a
compact, interpretable surrogate for solution operators that evaluate across
arbitrary time gaps in a single-shot, while remaining compatible with
scientific pipelines such as assimilation, control, and uncertainty
quantification. Looking forward, this framework offers scalable,
theory-grounded surrogates that bridge data-driven representation learning and
classical scientific modeling across disciplines.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种将多轮任务规划转化为单轮任务推理的新方法，通过GRPO算法利用专家轨迹的密集可验证奖励进行高效策略优化，在复杂任务规划基准上取得了优于更大基线模型的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 训练LLM代理进行复杂多轮任务规划面临稀疏奖励、长视野信用分配和强化学习计算开销等挑战，需要更高效的优化方法。

Method: 将多轮任务规划转化为单轮任务推理问题，采用Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO)算法，利用专家轨迹提供密集可验证奖励进行策略优化。

Result: 1.5B参数的模型在单轮GRPO训练下，在超过30步的长视野规划任务中达到70%的成功率，性能优于高达14B参数的基线模型。

Conclusion: 该方法不仅提高了多轮任务的成功概率，还展示了强大的跨任务泛化能力，训练在复杂任务上的模型能够成功完成所有更简单的子任务。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in
knowledge acquisition, reasoning, and tool use, making them promising
candidates for autonomous agent applications. However, training LLM agents for
complex multi-turn task planning faces significant challenges, including sparse
episode-wise rewards, credit assignment across long horizons, and the
computational overhead of reinforcement learning in multi-turn interaction
settings. To this end, this paper introduces a novel approach that transforms
multi-turn task planning into single-turn task reasoning problems, enabling
efficient policy optimization through Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO)
with dense and verifiable reward from expert trajectories. Our theoretical
analysis shows that GRPO improvement on single-turn task reasoning results in
higher multi-turn success probability under the minimal turns, as well as the
generalization to subtasks with shorter horizons. Experimental evaluation on
the complex task planning benchmark demonstrates that our 1.5B parameter model
trained with single-turn GRPO achieves superior performance compared to larger
baseline models up to 14B parameters, with success rates of 70% for
long-horizon planning tasks with over 30 steps. We also theoretically and
empirically validate the strong cross-task generalizability that the models
trained on complex tasks can lead to the successful completion of all simpler
subtasks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PFedDL是一种联邦字典学习框架，用于解决多站点fMRI研究中的数据隐私和站点异质性挑战，通过分解共享全局组件和个性化本地组件来提高模型泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多站点功能磁共振成像研究面临数据隐私约束和站点异质性导致的非独立同分布数据问题，这些因素阻碍了可泛化模型的开发。

Method: PFedDL在每个站点独立进行字典学习，将站点特定字典分解为共享全局组件和个性化本地组件。全局原子通过联邦聚合更新以促进跨站点一致性，本地原子独立优化以捕获站点特定变异性。

Result: 在ABIDE数据集上的实验表明，PFedDL在非独立同分布数据集上的准确性和鲁棒性优于现有方法。

Conclusion: PFedDL框架有效解决了多站点神经影像分析中的数据隐私和异质性挑战，为联邦学习在医学影像分析中的应用提供了新思路。

Abstract: Data privacy constraints pose significant challenges for large-scale
neuroimaging analysis, especially in multi-site functional magnetic resonance
imaging (fMRI) studies, where site-specific heterogeneity leads to
non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) data. These factors
hinder the development of generalizable models. To address these challenges, we
propose Personalized Federated Dictionary Learning (PFedDL), a novel federated
learning framework that enables collaborative modeling across sites without
sharing raw data. PFedDL performs independent dictionary learning at each site,
decomposing each site-specific dictionary into a shared global component and a
personalized local component. The global atoms are updated via federated
aggregation to promote cross-site consistency, while the local atoms are
refined independently to capture site-specific variability, thereby enhancing
downstream analysis. Experiments on the ABIDE dataset demonstrate that PFedDL
outperforms existing methods in accuracy and robustness across non-IID
datasets.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本研究使用MM-SHAP框架量化音频大语言模型中文本和音频模态对模型预测的相对贡献，发现高精度模型更多依赖文本回答问题，但音频模态仍能成功定位关键声音事件。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 音频大语言模型能够进行类似人类的音乐对话，但不确定它们是否真正在听音频还是仅使用文本推理。需要量化每个模态对模型输出的贡献。

Method: 采用基于Shapley值的MM-SHAP框架，在MuChoMusic基准上评估两个模型，量化文本和音频模态的相对贡献。

Result: 高精度模型更多依赖文本回答问题，但即使整体音频贡献较低，模型仍能成功定位关键声音事件，表明音频并未被完全忽略。

Conclusion: 这是MM-SHAP在音频大语言模型中的首次应用，为可解释AI和音频研究的未来发展奠定了基础。

Abstract: Audio Large Language Models (Audio LLMs) enable human-like conversation about
music, yet it is unclear if they are truly listening to the audio or just using
textual reasoning, as recent benchmarks suggest. This paper investigates this
issue by quantifying the contribution of each modality to a model's output. We
adapt the MM-SHAP framework, a performance-agnostic score based on Shapley
values that quantifies the relative contribution of each modality to a model's
prediction. We evaluate two models on the MuChoMusic benchmark and find that
the model with higher accuracy relies more on text to answer questions, but
further inspection shows that even if the overall audio contribution is low,
models can successfully localize key sound events, suggesting that audio is not
entirely ignored. Our study is the first application of MM-SHAP to Audio LLMs
and we hope it will serve as a foundational step for future research in
explainable AI and audio.

TL;DR: 提出CERMIC框架，通过观察同伴行为来校准内在好奇心，解决多智能体强化学习中稀疏奖励环境下的探索问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有好奇心机制将环境随机性与有意义的新颖性混淆，且忽视了同伴行为新颖性所编码的潜在任务动态，导致在去中心化、无通信的多智能体强化学习环境中探索效果不佳。

Method: 受人类儿童通过观察同伴自适应校准探索行为的启发，提出CERMIC框架：1）鲁棒过滤噪声惊喜信号；2）通过推断多智能体上下文动态校准内在好奇心；3）生成理论驱动的内在奖励，鼓励探索具有高信息增益的状态转移。

Result: 在VMAS、Meltingpot和SMACv2等基准测试中，CERMIC在稀疏奖励环境下的探索性能显著优于现有最先进算法。

Conclusion: CERMIC通过整合多智能体上下文信息有效提升了稀疏奖励环境中的探索效率，为多智能体强化学习提供了新的内在动机设计思路。

Abstract: Autonomous exploration in complex multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL)
with sparse rewards critically depends on providing agents with effective
intrinsic motivation. While artificial curiosity offers a powerful
self-supervised signal, it often confuses environmental stochasticity with
meaningful novelty. Moreover, existing curiosity mechanisms exhibit a uniform
novelty bias, treating all unexpected observations equally. However, peer
behavior novelty, which encode latent task dynamics, are often overlooked,
resulting in suboptimal exploration in decentralized, communication-free MARL
settings. To this end, inspired by how human children adaptively calibrate
their own exploratory behaviors via observing peers, we propose a novel
approach to enhance multi-agent exploration. We introduce CERMIC, a principled
framework that empowers agents to robustly filter noisy surprise signals and
guide exploration by dynamically calibrating their intrinsic curiosity with
inferred multi-agent context. Additionally, CERMIC generates
theoretically-grounded intrinsic rewards, encouraging agents to explore state
transitions with high information gain. We evaluate CERMIC on benchmark suites
including VMAS, Meltingpot, and SMACv2. Empirical results demonstrate that
exploration with CERMIC significantly outperforms SoTA algorithms in
sparse-reward environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 上下文学习虽然灵活，但其可靠性对提示长度高度敏感，需要建立理论框架来保证稳定性。

Method: 基于高维次高斯表示下的协方差谱特性分析，提出两阶段可观测估计器，包含单次校准步骤。

Result: 实验表明预测阈值与经验拐点高度一致，理论边界作为保守但可靠的上界，校准版本进一步缩小了差距。

Conclusion: 研究结果将谱覆盖与稳定的上下文学习联系起来，弥合了理论与部署之间的差距，提高了大规模提示在有限样本场景下的可解释性和可靠性。

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) is flexible but its reliability is highly sensitive
to prompt length. This paper establishes a non-asymptotic lower bound that
links the minimal number of demonstrations to ICL stability under fixed
high-dimensional sub-Gaussian representations. The bound gives explicit
sufficient conditions in terms of spectral properties of the covariance,
providing a computable criterion for practice. Building on this analysis, we
propose a two-stage observable estimator with a one-shot calibration that
produces practitioner-ready prompt-length estimates without distributional
priors. Experiments across diverse datasets, encoders, and generators show
close alignment between the predicted thresholds and empirical knee-points,
with the theory acting as a conservative but reliable upper bound; the
calibrated variant further tightens this gap. These results connect spectral
coverage to stable ICL, bridge theory and deployment, and improve the
interpretability and reliability of large-scale prompting in realistic
finite-sample regimes.

### [34] [Bispectral OT: Dataset Comparison using Symmetry-Aware Optimal Transport](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20678)
*Annabel Ma,Kaiying Hou,David Alvarez-Melis,Melanie Weber*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了Bispectral Optimal Transport（双谱最优传输），这是一种对称感知的离散OT扩展方法，通过使用双谱表示来比较元素，在对称丰富的设置中比传统基于几何距离的OT方法更好地保留数据的内在相干结构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在对称性丰富的场景中，仅基于原始特征间几何距离的OT对齐可能忽略数据的内在相干结构。传统OT方法无法有效处理由群作用引起的冗余变化，导致对应关系质量下降。

Method: 引入双谱最优传输方法，使用双谱（一种群傅里叶不变量）来表示元素。双谱保留了所有信号结构，同时仅去除由群作用引起的变化，从而实现对对称性的感知。

Result: 在经视觉对称变换的基准数据集上，Bispectral OT计算的传输计划比传统特征OT实现了更高的类别保持准确率，改善了有意义对应关系的质量。

Conclusion: Bispectral OT能够更好地捕获数据集中潜在的语义标签结构，同时去除不影响类别或内容的冗余变化，为对称性丰富的机器学习应用提供了更有效的对齐方法。

Abstract: Optimal transport (OT) is a widely used technique in machine learning,
graphics, and vision that aligns two distributions or datasets using their
relative geometry. In symmetry-rich settings, however, OT alignments based
solely on pairwise geometric distances between raw features can ignore the
intrinsic coherence structure of the data. We introduce Bispectral Optimal
Transport, a symmetry-aware extension of discrete OT that compares elements
using their representation using the bispectrum, a group Fourier invariant that
preserves all signal structure while removing only the variation due to group
actions. Empirically, we demonstrate that the transport plans computed with
Bispectral OT achieve greater class preservation accuracy than naive feature OT
on benchmark datasets transformed with visual symmetries, improving the quality
of meaningful correspondences that capture the underlying semantic label
structure in the dataset while removing nuisance variation not affecting class
or content.

Motivation: 组织希望利用联邦学习框架协作微调大语言模型，但担心隐私泄露问题。现有观点认为联邦学习通过参数共享保护隐私，但作者对此提出质疑。

Method: 通过大量实验验证联邦学习框架下的隐私泄露风险，包括使用简单生成方法提取训练数据，并开发了针对联邦学习的增强攻击策略，通过跟踪全局模型更新来加剧隐私泄露。

Result: 实验证明联邦学习无法完全保护隐私，攻击者能够成功提取训练数据，且模型规模越大泄露风险越高。作者还评估了差分隐私、正则化约束更新和安全对齐等隐私保护技术的效果。

Conclusion: 联邦学习框架下的大语言模型微调存在显著隐私风险，需要采用有效的隐私保护措施。研究为降低联邦学习中的隐私风险提供了实用指导。

Abstract: Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) with local data is a widely adopted
approach for organizations seeking to adapt LLMs to their specific domains.
Given the shared characteristics in data across different organizations, the
idea of collaboratively fine-tuning an LLM using data from multiple sources
presents an appealing opportunity. However, organizations are often reluctant
to share local data, making centralized fine-tuning impractical. Federated
learning (FL), a privacy-preserving framework, enables clients to retain local
data while sharing only model parameters for collaborative training, offering a
potential solution. While fine-tuning LLMs on centralized datasets risks data
leakage through next-token prediction, the iterative aggregation process in FL
results in a global model that encapsulates generalized knowledge, which some
believe protects client privacy. In this paper, however, we present
contradictory findings through extensive experiments. We show that attackers
can still extract training data from the global model, even using
straightforward generation methods, with leakage increasing as the model size
grows. Moreover, we introduce an enhanced attack strategy tailored to FL, which
tracks global model updates during training to intensify privacy leakage. To
mitigate these risks, we evaluate privacy-preserving techniques in FL,
including differential privacy, regularization-constrained updates and adopting
LLMs with safety alignment. Our results provide valuable insights and practical
guidelines for reducing privacy risks when training LLMs with FL.

Motivation: 现有深度学习模型通常通过简单拼接融合配体和蛋白质表示，缺乏明确的几何正则化，导致在化学空间和时间上的泛化能力差

Method: 使用特征线性调制层将分子嵌入条件化到蛋白质嵌入上，通过三元组损失强制度量结构，采用基于嵌入距离的RBF回归头进行亲和力预测

Result: 在Therapeutics Data Commons DTI-DG基准测试中达到最先进性能，通过消融研究和域外评估验证了有效性

Conclusion: 条件化和度量学习对于稳健的药物-靶点亲和力预测具有重要价值

Abstract: Accurate prediction of drug-target binding affinity can accelerate drug
discovery by prioritizing promising compounds before costly wet-lab screening.
While deep learning has advanced this task, most models fuse ligand and protein
representations via simple concatenation and lack explicit geometric
regularization, resulting in poor generalization across chemical space and
time. We introduce FIRM-DTI, a lightweight framework that conditions molecular
embeddings on protein embeddings through a feature-wise linear modulation
(FiLM) layer and enforces metric structure with a triplet loss. An RBF
regression head operating on embedding distances yields smooth, interpretable
affinity predictions. Despite its modest size, FIRM-DTI achieves
state-of-the-art performance on the Therapeutics Data Commons DTI-DG benchmark,
as demonstrated by an extensive ablation study and out-of-domain evaluation.
Our results underscore the value of conditioning and metric learning for robust
drug-target affinity prediction.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有PPO及其变体在训练过程中由于裁剪机制会丢弃低概率token的宝贵梯度信号，而这些信号对调节熵演化具有关键作用，需要一种能够温和引入这些梯度的方法。

Method: 提出CE-GPPO算法，以温和有界的方式重新引入被裁剪token的梯度，通过控制裁剪区间外token的梯度幅度来实现探索-利用平衡。

Result: 理论分析和实验证据表明CE-GPPO能有效缓解熵不稳定性，在数学推理基准测试中在不同模型规模下均优于强基线方法。

Conclusion: CE-GPPO通过梯度保留机制成功解决了PPO中梯度信号丢失问题，为强化学习优化大语言模型提供了更稳定的训练方法。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has become a powerful paradigm for optimizing
large language models (LLMs) to handle complex reasoning tasks. A core
challenge in this process lies in managing policy entropy, which reflects the
balance between exploration and exploitation during training. Existing methods,
such as proximal policy optimization (PPO) and its variants, discard valuable
gradient signals from low-probability tokens due to the clipping mechanism. We
systematically analyze the entropy dynamics and reveal that these clipped
tokens play a critical yet overlooked role in regulating entropy evolution. We
propose \textbf{C}ontrolling \textbf{E}ntropy via
\textbf{G}radient-\textbf{P}reserving \textbf{P}olicy \textbf{O}ptimization
(CE-GPPO), a novel algorithm that reintroduces gradients from clipped tokens in
native PPO in a gentle and bounded manner. By controlling the magnitude of
gradients from tokens outside the clipping interval, CE-GPPO is able to achieve
an exploration-exploitation trade-off. We provide theoretical justification and
empirical evidence showing that CE-GPPO effectively mitigates entropy
instability. Extensive experiments on mathematical reasoning benchmarks show
that CE-GPPO consistently outperforms strong baselines across different model
scales.

Conclusion: SynGA不仅是一个强大的独立基准，还可作为模块集成到更大的合成感知工作流中，因其轻量级和内置可合成性约束特性。

Abstract: Inspired by the effectiveness of genetic algorithms and the importance of
synthesizability in molecular design, we present SynGA, a simple genetic
algorithm that operates directly over synthesis routes. Our method features
custom crossover and mutation operators that explicitly constrain it to
synthesizable molecular space. By modifying the fitness function, we
demonstrate the effectiveness of SynGA on a variety of design tasks, including
synthesizable analog search and sample-efficient property optimization, for
both 2D and 3D objectives. Furthermore, by coupling SynGA with a machine
learning-based filter that focuses the building block set, we boost SynGA to
state-of-the-art performance. For property optimization, this manifests as a
model-based variant SynGBO, which employs SynGA and block filtering in the
inner loop of Bayesian optimization. Since SynGA is lightweight and enforces
synthesizability by construction, our hope is that SynGA can not only serve as
a strong standalone baseline but also as a versatile module that can be
incorporated into larger synthesis-aware workflows in the future.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文揭示了深度学习中的缩放定律本质上是冗余定律，通过核回归证明了数据协方差谱的多项式尾部会产生具有特定指数的幂律风险，表明学习曲线的斜率取决于数据冗余度而非普遍性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习中的缩放定律显示了模型性能随数据集和模型规模增加的幂律改进，但其数学起源特别是缩放指数一直难以解释。本文旨在从数学上严格解释缩放定律的本质。

Method: 使用核回归方法，分析数据协方差谱的多项式尾部对超额风险的影响，建立缩放指数与数据冗余度的数学关系，并在多种场景下验证该定律的普适性。

Result: 发现缩放指数α = 2s/(2s + 1/β)，其中β控制谱尾部，1/β衡量冗余度。更陡峭的谱会加速规模收益，学习曲线的斜率不是普适的而是依赖于数据冗余度。

Conclusion: 这项工作首次从数学上严格解释了缩放定律作为有限样本冗余定律的本质，统一了经验观察与理论基础，揭示了数据冗余在深度学习缩放中的核心作用。

Abstract: Scaling laws, a defining feature of deep learning, reveal a striking
power-law improvement in model performance with increasing dataset and model
size. Yet, their mathematical origins, especially the scaling exponent, have
remained elusive. In this work, we show that scaling laws can be formally
explained as redundancy laws. Using kernel regression, we show that a
polynomial tail in the data covariance spectrum yields an excess risk power law
with exponent alpha = 2s / (2s + 1/beta), where beta controls the spectral tail
and 1/beta measures redundancy. This reveals that the learning curve's slope is
not universal but depends on data redundancy, with steeper spectra accelerating
returns to scale. We establish the law's universality across boundedly
invertible transformations, multi-modal mixtures, finite-width approximations,
and Transformer architectures in both linearized (NTK) and feature-learning
regimes. This work delivers the first rigorous mathematical explanation of
scaling laws as finite-sample redundancy laws, unifying empirical observations
with theoretical foundations.

Method: 构建水印增强的训练和评估数据集（Watermark-Spoofing数据集），应用多种手工和神经水印方法到现有反欺骗数据集上，并提出知识保持水印学习（KPWL）框架

Result: 实验表明水印会持续降低反欺骗性能，水印密度越高，等错误率（EER）越高

Conclusion: 音频水印是一个被忽视的领域偏移，本研究为开发水印弹性反欺骗系统建立了首个基准

Abstract: This paper presents the first study on the impact of audio watermarking on
spoofing countermeasures. While anti-spoofing systems are essential for
securing speech-based applications, the influence of widely used audio
watermarking, originally designed for copyright protection, remains largely
unexplored. We construct watermark-augmented training and evaluation datasets,
named the Watermark-Spoofing dataset, by applying diverse handcrafted and
neural watermarking methods to existing anti-spoofing datasets. Experiments
show that watermarking consistently degrades anti-spoofing performance, with
higher watermark density correlating with higher Equal Error Rates (EERs). To
mitigate this, we propose the Knowledge-Preserving Watermark Learning (KPWL)
framework, enabling models to adapt to watermark-induced shifts while
preserving their original-domain spoofing detection capability. These findings
reveal audio watermarking as a previously overlooked domain shift and establish
the first benchmark for developing watermark-resilient anti-spoofing systems.

TL;DR: 本文研究了Transformer-based表格数据合成工具的超参数敏感性，发现轻量级LLM配置在保持数据质量的同时能降低计算需求，但运行时间仍高于其他工具。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer-based模型在表格数据合成质量上优于GAN和Diffusion模型，但计算成本高。本研究旨在评估超参数选择对合成数据质量和计算性能的影响。

Method: 在两个工具(GReaT和REaLTabFormer)上评估10种不同架构类型和深度的模型配置，从运行时间、ML效用和与真实数据分布的相似性三个维度进行敏感性分析，使用四个真实世界数据集进行实验。

Result: 运行时间与超参数数量成正比，浅层配置完成更快；GReaT运行时间始终低于REaLTabFormer；小数据集上两种工具都能产生高质量合成数据，但大数据集上只有REaLTabFormer能保持强效用和相似性。

Conclusion: REaLTabFormer配合轻量级LLM提供了最佳平衡，能在保持数据质量的同时降低计算需求，但其运行时间仍高于其他TDS工具，表明效率提升存在一定限度。

Abstract: Synthetic tabular data is used for privacy-preserving data sharing and
data-driven model development. Its effectiveness, however, depends heavily on
the used Tabular Data Synthesis (TDS) tool. Recent studies have shown that
Transformer-based models outperform other state-of-the-art models such as
Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Diffusion models in terms of data
quality. However, Transformer-based models also come with high computational
costs, making them sometimes unfeasible for end users with prosumer hardware.
This study presents a sensitivity assessment on how the choice of
hyperparameters, such as number of layers or hidden dimension affects the
quality of the resultant synthetic data and the computational performance. It
is performed across two tools, GReaT and REaLTabFormer, evaluating 10 model
setups that vary in architecture type and depth. We assess the sensitivity on
three dimensions: runtime, machine learning (ML) utility, and similarity to
real data distributions. Experiments were conducted on four real-world
datasets. Our findings reveal that runtime is proportional to the number of
hyperparameters, with shallower configurations completing faster. GReaT
consistently achieves lower runtimes than REaLTabFormer, and only on the
largest dataset they have comparable runtime. For small datasets, both tools
achieve synthetic data with high utility and optimal similarity, but on larger
datasets only REaLTabFormer sustains strong utility and similarity. As a
result, REaLTabFormer with lightweight LLMs provides the best balance, since it
preserves data quality while reducing computational requirements. Nonetheless,
its runtime remains higher than that of GReaT and other TDS tools, suggesting
that efficiency gains are possible but only up to a certain level.

Motivation: 现实世界时间序列数据存在非平稳性，传统MLP模型在处理具有不同分布的通道时存在局限性，无法有效捕捉季节模式和残差分量等局部变化。

Method: 提出MLP+CNN混合架构：MLP建模整体趋势和长期依赖，CNN使用多样化卷积核建模细粒度局部模式。设计了IConv卷积架构，独立处理时间依赖通道，通过不同层考虑通道间关系。

Result: 在多个时间序列数据集上的实验表明，所提方法在多元时间序列预测方面具有优越性能。

Abstract: Real-world time-series data often exhibit non-stationarity, including
changing trends, irregular seasonality, and residuals. In terms of changing
trends, recently proposed multi-layer perceptron (MLP)-based models have shown
excellent performance owing to their computational efficiency and ability to
capture long-term dependency. However, the linear nature of MLP architectures
poses limitations when applied to channels with diverse distributions,
resulting in local variations such as seasonal patterns and residual components
being ignored. However, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) can effectively
incorporate these variations. To resolve the limitations of MLP, we propose
combining them with CNNs. The overall trend is modeled using an MLP to consider
long-term dependencies. The CNN uses diverse kernels to model fine-grained
local patterns in conjunction with MLP trend predictions. To focus on modeling
local variation, we propose IConv, a novel convolutional architecture that
processes the temporal dependency channel independently and considers the
inter-channel relationship through distinct layers. Independent channel
processing enables the modeling of diverse local temporal dependencies and the
adoption of a large kernel size. Distinct inter-channel considerations reduce
computational cost. The proposed model is evaluated through extensive
experiments on time-series datasets. The results reveal the superiority of the
proposed method for multivariate time-series forecasting.

*Abhishek Moturu,Anna Goldenberg,Babak Taati*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LiLAW是一种轻量级自适应加权方法，通过三个可学习参数动态调整训练样本的损失权重，根据样本难度（简单、中等、困难）进行优先级排序，无需大量超参数调优或干净验证集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决在噪声标签和数据异质性存在的情况下训练深度神经网络的挑战，提高模型在噪声环境下的鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Method: 使用三个可学习参数动态调整每个训练样本的损失权重，基于样本的难度级别进行分类。在每个训练小批量后，使用验证集上的单个小批量梯度下降步骤更新权重。

Result: 在多个通用和医学影像数据集、不同噪声水平和类型、损失函数和架构上的广泛实验表明，LiLAW能持续提升性能，即使在高噪声环境下也有效。

Conclusion: LiLAW提供了一种计算高效的解决方案，可在任何神经网络训练设置中增强模型的泛化能力和鲁棒性，且不严重依赖数据增强或高级正则化技术。

Abstract: Training deep neural networks in the presence of noisy labels and data
heterogeneity is a major challenge. We introduce Lightweight Learnable Adaptive
Weighting (LiLAW), a novel method that dynamically adjusts the loss weight of
each training sample based on its evolving difficulty level, categorized as
easy, moderate, or hard. Using only three learnable parameters, LiLAW
adaptively prioritizes informative samples throughout training by updating
these weights using a single mini-batch gradient descent step on the validation
set after each training mini-batch, without requiring excessive hyperparameter
tuning or a clean validation set. Extensive experiments across multiple general
and medical imaging datasets, noise levels and types, loss functions, and
architectures with and without pretraining demonstrate that LiLAW consistently
enhances performance, even in high-noise environments. It is effective without
heavy reliance on data augmentation or advanced regularization, highlighting
its practicality. It offers a computationally efficient solution to boost model
generalization and robustness in any neural network training setup.

*Qiyu Chen,Guozhang Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了任务依赖初始化（TDI）框架，通过功率谱匹配方法使状态空间模型（SSMs）的归纳偏置与任务的光谱特性对齐，从而提高数据效率和泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模模型的成功依赖于缩放定律，但高质量数据的有限性带来了挑战。现有的状态空间模型使用固定的归纳偏置，当任务结构与模型偏置不匹配时会导致样本效率低下。

Method: 首先形式化线性时不变SSMs的归纳偏置，提出TDI方法：通过功率谱匹配在训练前将模型偏置与任务光谱特性对齐。

Result: 在多个真实世界基准测试中，TDI显著提高了泛化能力和样本效率，特别是在低数据情况下效果明显。

Conclusion: 这项工作为创建更数据高效的模型提供了理论和实践工具，是实现可持续缩放的关键一步。

Abstract: The remarkable success of large-scale models is fundamentally tied to scaling
laws, yet the finite nature of high-quality data presents a looming challenge.
One of the next frontiers in modeling is data efficiency: the ability to learn
more from less. A model's inductive bias is a critical lever for this, but
foundational sequence models like State Space Models (SSMs) rely on a fixed
bias. This fixed prior is sample-inefficient when a task's underlying structure
does not match. In this work, we introduce a principled framework to solve this
problem. We first formalize the inductive bias of linear time-invariant SSMs
through an SSM-induced kernel, mathematically and empirically proving its
spectrum is directly governed by the model's frequency response. Further, we
propose a method of Task-Dependent Initialization (TDI): power spectrum
matching, a fast and efficient method that aligns the model's inductive bias
with the task's spectral characteristics before large-scale training. Our
experiments on a diverse set of real-world benchmarks show that TDI
significantly improves generalization and sample efficiency, particularly in
low-data regimes. This work provides a theoretical and practical tool to create
more data-efficient models, a crucial step towards sustainable scaling.

*Zhengxiao Li,Liming Lu,Xu Zheng,Siyuan Liang,Zhenghan Chen,Yongbin Zhou,Shuchao Pang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了FERD框架，首个关注公平性的数据自由鲁棒性蒸馏方法，通过调整对抗样本的比例和分布来解决现有方法忽视的鲁棒公平性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数据自由鲁棒性蒸馏方法只关注整体鲁棒性，忽视了不同类别间的鲁棒性差异问题，导致学生模型在不同类别上表现出严重的鲁棒性差异。

Method: FERD采用鲁棒性引导的类别重加权策略调整样本比例，为鲁棒性较弱的类别合成更多样本；通过特征级预测均匀性约束生成公平感知样本，并构建均匀目标对抗样本来避免有偏攻击方向。

Result: 在三个公开数据集上的实验表明，FERD在所有对抗攻击下都实现了最先进的最差类别鲁棒性，例如在CIFAR-10上使用MobileNet-V2时，FGSM和AutoAttack下的最差类别鲁棒性分别提高了15.1%和6.4%。

Conclusion: FERD在鲁棒性和公平性方面都表现出优越性能，有效解决了数据自由鲁棒性蒸馏中的公平性问题。

Abstract: Data-Free Robustness Distillation (DFRD) aims to transfer the robustness from
the teacher to the student without accessing the training data. While existing
methods focus on overall robustness, they overlook the robust fairness issues,
leading to severe disparity of robustness across different categories. In this
paper, we find two key problems: (1) student model distilled with equal class
proportion data behaves significantly different across distinct categories; and
(2) the robustness of student model is not stable across different attacks
target. To bridge these gaps, we present the first Fairness-Enhanced data-free
Robustness Distillation (FERD) framework to adjust the proportion and
distribution of adversarial examples. For the proportion, FERD adopts a
robustness-guided class reweighting strategy to synthesize more samples for the
less robust categories, thereby improving robustness of them. For the
distribution, FERD generates complementary data samples for advanced robustness
distillation. It generates Fairness-Aware Examples (FAEs) by enforcing a
uniformity constraint on feature-level predictions, which suppress the
dominance of class-specific non-robust features, providing a more balanced
representation across all categories. Then, FERD constructs Uniform-Target
Adversarial Examples (UTAEs) from FAEs by applying a uniform target class
constraint to avoid biased attack directions, which distribute the attack
targets across all categories and prevents overfitting to specific vulnerable
categories. Extensive experiments on three public datasets show that FERD
achieves state-of-the-art worst-class robustness under all adversarial attack
(e.g., the worst-class robustness under FGSM and AutoAttack are improved by
15.1\% and 6.4\% using MobileNet-V2 on CIFAR-10), demonstrating superior
performance in both robustness and fairness aspects.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: T2I-Diff是一个基于时间-频率表示和去噪扩散的fMRI生成框架，通过将BOLD信号转换为窗口谱图并训练分类器无关的扩散模型来生成高质量的fMRI数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: fMRI数据采集资源密集，高质量样本稀缺，现有生成模型因忽略BOLD信号的非平稳性和非线性动态而性能不佳。

Method: 将BOLD信号通过时变傅里叶变换转换为窗口谱图，训练分类器无关的扩散模型生成类条件频率谱图，再通过逆傅里叶变换还原为BOLD信号。

Result: 该方法在下游fMRI脑网络分类任务中表现出更高的准确性和泛化能力。

Conclusion: T2I-Diff框架能有效生成高质量的fMRI数据，解决了现有生成模型在捕捉复杂BOLD动态方面的不足。

Abstract: Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) is an advanced neuroimaging
method that enables in-depth analysis of brain activity by measuring dynamic
changes in the blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) signals. However, the
resource-intensive nature of fMRI data acquisition limits the availability of
high-fidelity samples required for data-driven brain analysis models. While
modern generative models can synthesize fMRI data, they often underperform
because they overlook the complex non-stationarity and nonlinear BOLD dynamics.
To address these challenges, we introduce T2I-Diff, an fMRI generation
framework that leverages time-frequency representation of BOLD signals and
classifier-free denoising diffusion. Specifically, our framework first converts
BOLD signals into windowed spectrograms via a time-dependent Fourier transform,
capturing both the underlying temporal dynamics and spectral evolution.
Subsequently, a classifier-free diffusion model is trained to generate
class-conditioned frequency spectrograms, which are then reverted to BOLD
signals via inverse Fourier transforms. Finally, we validate the efficacy of
our approach by demonstrating improved accuracy and generalization in
downstream fMRI-based brain network classification.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CaTS-Bench是第一个大规模、真实世界的时间序列描述基准，包含46.5万训练样本和10.5万测试样本，每个样本包含数值序列、元数据、线图图像和描述文本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有时间序列描述基准通常依赖合成数据或过于简化的描述，且忽视元数据和视觉表示，需要建立更全面的基准。

Method: 从11个多样化数据集构建基准，采用可扩展的管道生成参考描述：大部分由oracle LLM生成并通过事实检查、人类不可区分性研究和多样性分析验证，同时提供579个人工修订的测试描述。

Result: 建立了CaTS-Bench基准，包含描述任务和460个多选题，提出了新的评估指标，并对领先的VLM进行了基准测试。

Conclusion: CaTS-Bench及其描述管道为时间序列分析与基础模型的交叉研究提供了可靠且可扩展的基础。

Abstract: Time series captioning, the task of describing numeric time series in natural
language, requires numerical reasoning, trend interpretation, and contextual
understanding. Existing benchmarks, however, often rely on synthetic data or
overly simplistic captions, and typically neglect metadata and visual
representations. To close this gap, we introduce CaTS-Bench, the first
large-scale, real-world benchmark for Context-aware Time Series captioning.
CaTS-Bench is derived from 11 diverse datasets reframed as captioning and Q&A
tasks, comprising roughly 465k training and 105k test timestamps. Each sample
includes a numeric series segment, contextual metadata, a line-chart image, and
a caption. A key contribution of this work is the scalable pipeline used to
generate reference captions: while most references are produced by an oracle
LLM and verified through factual checks, human indistinguishability studies,
and diversity analyses, we also provide a human-revisited subset of 579 test
captions, refined from LLM outputs to ensure accuracy and human-like style.
Beyond captioning, CaTS-Bench offers 460 multiple-choice questions targeting
deeper aspects of time series reasoning. We further propose new tailored
evaluation metrics and benchmark leading VLMs, highlighting both their
strengths and persistent limitations. Together, these contributions establish
CaTS-Bench and its captioning pipeline as a reliable and extensible foundation
for future research at the intersection of time series analysis and foundation
models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度神经网络训练动态中的后期现象（如grokking和信息瓶颈）机制及其关系尚不明确，需要统一的理论解释。

Method: 通过神经坍缩理论分析学习表示的几何特性，研究类内方差收缩的动态过程，并在多个数据集和架构上进行验证。

Result: 发现类内方差收缩是grokking和信息瓶颈现象的共同关键因素，不同时间尺度解释了后期训练行为。

Conclusion: 神经坍缩为理解深度神经网络训练后期现象提供了统一框架，揭示了表示几何动态在模型学习过程中的重要作用。

Abstract: The training dynamics of deep neural networks often defy expectations, even
as these models form the foundation of modern machine learning. Two prominent
examples are grokking, where test performance improves abruptly long after the
training loss has plateaued, and the information bottleneck principle, where
models progressively discard input information irrelevant to the prediction
task as training proceeds. However, the mechanisms underlying these phenomena
and their relations remain poorly understood. In this work, we present a
unified explanation of such late-phase phenomena through the lens of neural
collapse, which characterizes the geometry of learned representations. We show
that the contraction of population within-class variance is a key factor
underlying both grokking and information bottleneck, and relate this measure to
the neural collapse measure defined on the training set. By analyzing the
dynamics of neural collapse, we show that distinct time scales between fitting
the training set and the progression of neural collapse account for the
behavior of the late-phase phenomena. Finally, we validate our theoretical
findings on multiple datasets and architectures.

TL;DR: 提出两阶段训练框架，通过单模态预训练调整初始状态来缓解多模态融合中的模态竞争问题，引入有效竞争强度(ECS)概念和FastPID可计算诊断指标，实现更优的多模态融合性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态融合中常出现模态竞争问题，一个模态主导学习过程而其他模态优化不足。现有方法多在联合学习阶段处理此问题，忽视了模型初始状态的关键影响。

Method: 提出两阶段训练框架：1）单模态预训练阶段通过ECS理论分析调整初始状态；2）开发FastPID可计算指标分解信息为独特性、冗余性和协同性；3）异步控制器动态平衡模态并定位理想初始状态。

Result: 在多个基准测试中实现了最先进的性能，证明通过调整预融合模型的初始状态可以有效缓解模态竞争，实现协同多模态融合。

Conclusion: 在融合前调整预融合模型的初始状态是一种有效策略，可以在竞争开始前缓解问题，可靠地实现协同多模态融合。

Abstract: Multi-modal fusion often suffers from modality competition during joint
training, where one modality dominates the learning process, leaving others
under-optimized. Overlooking the critical impact of the model's initial state,
most existing methods address this issue during the joint learning stage. In
this study, we introduce a two-stage training framework to shape the initial
states through unimodal training before the joint training. First, we propose
the concept of Effective Competitive Strength (ECS) to quantify a modality's
competitive strength. Our theoretical analysis further reveals that properly
shaping the initial ECS by unimodal training achieves a provably tighter error
bound. However, ECS is computationally intractable in deep neural networks. To
bridge this gap, we develop a framework comprising two core components: a
fine-grained computable diagnostic metric and an asynchronous training
controller. For the metric, we first prove that mutual information(MI) is a
principled proxy for ECS. Considering MI is induced by per-modality marginals
and thus treats each modality in isolation, we further propose FastPID, a
computationally efficient and differentiable solver for partial information
decomposition, which decomposes the joint distribution's information into
fine-grained measurements: modality-specific uniqueness, redundancy, and
synergy. Guided by these measurements, our asynchronous controller dynamically
balances modalities by monitoring uniqueness and locates the ideal initial
state to start joint training by tracking peak synergy. Experiments on diverse
benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance.
Our work establishes that shaping the pre-fusion models' initial state is a
powerful strategy that eases competition before it starts, reliably unlocking
synergistic multi-modal fusion.

Conclusion: MOIRA方法具有生物学相关性，能够有效处理多组学数据中的缺失模态问题。

Abstract: Multi-omics data capture complex biomolecular interactions and provide
insights into metabolism and disease. However, missing modalities hinder
integrative analysis across heterogeneous omics. To address this, we present
MOIRA (Multi-Omics Integration with Robustness to Absent modalities), an early
integration method enabling robust learning from incomplete omics data via
representation alignment and adaptive aggregation. MOIRA leverages all samples,
including those with missing modalities, by projecting each omics dataset onto
a shared embedding space where a learnable weighting mechanism fuses them.
Evaluated on the Religious Order Study and Memory and Aging Project (ROSMAP)
dataset for Alzheimer's Disease (AD), MOIRA outperformed existing approaches,
and further ablation studies confirmed modality-wise contributions. Feature
importance analysis revealed AD-related biomarkers consistent with prior
literature, highlighting the biological relevance of our approach.

Conclusion: 本文提出了因果TSG任务家族，并通过CaTSG提供了概念验证，为在干预和反事实场景下实现更可靠的模拟开辟了有前景的方向。

Abstract: Time series generation (TSG) synthesizes realistic sequences and has achieved
remarkable success. Among TSG, conditional models generate sequences given
observed covariates, however, such models learn observational correlations
without considering unobserved confounding. In this work, we propose a causal
perspective on conditional TSG and introduce causal time series generation as a
new TSG task family, formalized within Pearl's causal ladder, extending beyond
observational generation to include interventional and counterfactual settings.
To instantiate these tasks, we develop CaTSG, a unified diffusion-based
framework with backdoor-adjusted guidance that causally steers sampling toward
desired interventions and individual counterfactuals while preserving
observational fidelity. Specifically, our method derives causal score functions
via backdoor adjustment and the abduction-action-prediction procedure, thus
enabling principled support for all three levels of TSG. Extensive experiments
on both synthetic and real-world datasets show that CaTSG achieves superior
fidelity and also supporting interventional and counterfactual generation that
existing baselines cannot handle. Overall, we propose the causal TSG family and
instantiate it with CaTSG, providing an initial proof-of-concept and opening a
promising direction toward more reliable simulation under interventions and
counterfactual generation.

Conclusion: 该方法可应用于研究数据集以支持AI风险算法开发，未来可集成到可穿戴FHR监测设备中，实现更早、更稳健的风险检测

Abstract: Approximately 10\% of newborns require assistance to initiate breathing at
birth, and around 5\% need ventilation support. Fetal heart rate (FHR)
monitoring plays a crucial role in assessing fetal well-being during prenatal
care, enabling the detection of abnormal patterns and supporting timely
obstetric interventions to mitigate fetal risks during labor. Applying
artificial intelligence (AI) methods to analyze large datasets of continuous
FHR monitoring episodes with diverse outcomes may offer novel insights into
predicting the risk of needing breathing assistance or interventions. Recent
advances in wearable FHR monitors have enabled continuous fetal monitoring
without compromising maternal mobility. However, sensor displacement during
maternal movement, as well as changes in fetal or maternal position, often lead
to signal dropouts, resulting in gaps in the recorded FHR data. Such missing
data limits the extraction of meaningful insights and complicates automated
(AI-based) analysis. Traditional approaches to handle missing data, such as
simple interpolation techniques, often fail to preserve the spectral
characteristics of the signals. In this paper, we propose a masked
transformer-based autoencoder approach to reconstruct missing FHR signals by
capturing both spatial and frequency components of the data. The proposed
method demonstrates robustness across varying durations of missing data and can
be used for signal inpainting and forecasting. The proposed approach can be
applied retrospectively to research datasets to support the development of
AI-based risk algorithms. In the future, the proposed method could be
integrated into wearable FHR monitoring devices to achieve earlier and more
robust risk detection.

Motivation: 当前对LLM推理风格、模型架构和任务类型之间相互作用的理解不足，需要系统性的评估框架。

Method: 构建StyleBench基准，评估CoT、ToT、AoT、SoT、CoD等5种推理风格在5个推理任务上的表现，使用15个开源模型（270M-120B参数）。

Result: 搜索型方法（AoT、ToT）在开放式问题上表现优异但需要大模型，简洁风格（SoT、CoD）在定义明确任务上效率更高；小模型常无法遵循输出指令而猜测，推理鲁棒性随规模增长。

Conclusion: 推理策略选择应基于具体约束条件，提供了选择最优推理策略的关键路线图，并开源了基准测试。

Abstract: The effectiveness of Large Language Models (LLMs) is heavily influenced by
the reasoning strategies, or styles of thought, employed in their prompts.
However, the interplay between these reasoning styles, model architecture, and
task type remains poorly understood. To address this, we introduce StyleBench,
a comprehensive benchmark for systematically evaluating reasoning styles across
diverse tasks and models. We assess five representative reasoning styles,
including Chain of Thought (CoT), Tree of Thought (ToT), Algorithm of Thought
(AoT), Sketch of Thought (SoT), and Chain-of-Draft (CoD) on five reasoning
tasks, using 15 open-source models from major families (LLaMA, Qwen, Mistral,
Gemma, GPT-OSS, Phi, and DeepSeek) ranging from 270M to 120B parameters. Our
large-scale analysis reveals that no single style is universally optimal. We
demonstrate that strategy efficacy is highly contingent on both model scale and
task type: search-based methods (AoT, ToT) excel in open-ended problems but
require large-scale models, while concise styles (SoT, CoD) achieve radical
efficiency gains on well-defined tasks. Furthermore, we identify key behavioral
patterns: smaller models frequently fail to follow output instructions and
default to guessing, while reasoning robustness emerges as a function of scale.
Our findings offer a crucial roadmap for selecting optimal reasoning strategies
based on specific constraints, we open source the benchmark in
https://github.com/JamesJunyuGuo/Style_Bench.

Abstract: Delays frequently occur in real-world environments, yet standard

may arrive out-of-sequence, a setting that has not been previously addressed in
RL. We analyze the structure of such delays and demonstrate that naive
approaches, such as stacking past observations, are insufficient for reliable
performance. To address this, we propose a model-based filtering process that
sequentially updates the belief state based on an incoming stream of
observations. We then introduce a simple delay-aware framework that
incorporates this idea into model-based RL, enabling agents to effectively
handle random delays. Applying this framework to Dreamer, we compare our
approach to delay-aware baselines developed for MDPs. Our method consistently
outperforms these baselines and demonstrates robustness to delay distribution
shifts during deployment. Additionally, we present experiments on simulated
robotic tasks, comparing our method to common practical heuristics and
emphasizing the importance of explicitly modeling observation delays.

*Christoph Düsing,Philipp Cimiano*

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种联邦学习中的客户端选择方法，通过将当前标签分布与目标分布（平衡分布或联邦组合标签分布）对齐来缓解数据不平衡问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦学习中客户端数据不平衡会降低共享模型的性能，现有方法主要通过客户端选择来缓解这一问题。

Method: 扩展现有联邦学习策略，选择能够使当前标签分布与目标分布（平衡分布或联邦组合标签分布）最佳对齐的活跃客户端。

Result: 在三种常见联邦学习策略和两个数据集上的实验表明，面对局部不平衡时，与平衡分布对齐效果最好；面对全局不平衡时，与联邦组合标签分布对齐更优。

Conclusion: 所提出的分布控制客户端选择方法能有效提升联邦学习在数据不平衡场景下的性能，具体选择策略应根据不平衡类型（局部或全局）而定。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) is a distributed learning paradigm that allows
multiple clients to jointly train a shared model while maintaining data
privacy. Despite its great potential for domains with strict data privacy
requirements, the presence of data imbalance among clients is a thread to the
success of FL, as it causes the performance of the shared model to decrease. To
address this, various studies have proposed enhancements to existing FL
strategies, particularly through client selection methods that mitigate the
detrimental effects of data imbalance. In this paper, we propose an extension
to existing FL strategies, which selects active clients that best align the
current label distribution with one of two target distributions, namely a
balanced distribution or the federations combined label distribution.
Subsequently, we empirically verify the improvements through our
distribution-controlled client selection on three common FL strategies and two
datasets. Our results show that while aligning the label distribution with a
balanced distribution yields the greatest improvements facing local imbalance,
alignment with the federation's combined label distribution is superior for
global imbalance.

*Christoph Düsing,Philipp Cimiano*

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于联邦学习的注意力增强LSTM模型，用于ICU脓毒症发病预测，支持可变预测窗口，在保护患者隐私的同时提高早期检测能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ICU脓毒症早期准确预测对改善患者预后至关重要，但单个医院数据有限且存在隐私问题，需要跨机构协作训练模型。

Method: 使用联邦学习框架结合注意力机制的LSTM模型，在多中心ICU数据上训练，支持可变预测窗口进行短期和长期预测。

Result: 联邦学习不仅整体性能接近集中式模型，而且特别有利于早期脓毒症预测；可变预测窗口在性能损失不大的情况下显著降低计算和通信开销。

Conclusion: 该方法通过联邦学习实现跨机构协作，在保护隐私的同时提高了脓毒症早期检测能力，可变预测窗口设计具有实用价值。

Abstract: Early and accurate prediction of sepsis onset remains a major challenge in
intensive care, where timely detection and subsequent intervention can
significantly improve patient outcomes. While machine learning models have
shown promise in this domain, their success is often limited by the amount and
diversity of training data available to individual hospitals and Intensive Care
Units (ICUs). Federated Learning (FL) addresses this issue by enabling
collaborative model training across institutions without requiring data
sharing, thus preserving patient privacy. In this work, we propose a federated,
attention-enhanced Long Short-Term Memory model for sepsis onset prediction,
trained on multi-centric ICU data. Unlike existing approaches that rely on
fixed prediction windows, our model supports variable prediction horizons,
enabling both short- and long-term forecasting in a single unified model.
During analysis, we put particular emphasis on the improvements through our
approach in terms of early sepsis detection, i.e., predictions with large
prediction windows by conducting an in-depth temporal analysis. Our results
prove that using FL does not merely improve overall prediction performance
(with performance approaching that of a centralized model), but is particularly
beneficial for early sepsis onset prediction. Finally, we show that our choice
of employing a variable prediction window rather than a fixed window does not
hurt performance significantly but reduces computational, communicational, and
organizational overhead.

TL;DR: 提出一种基于马尔可夫链的离散状态扩散模型确定性去噪算法，通过引入具有弱混沌动力学的herding算法变体来实现确定性离散状态转换，无需重新训练或连续状态嵌入。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的离散扩散模型使用随机去噪过程，本文旨在开发确定性反向过程来替代随机过程，提高离散扩散在生成建模中的重要性。

Method: 使用马尔可夫链和herding算法变体，引入弱混沌动力学来实现确定性离散状态转换，直接替代随机去噪过程。

Result: 在文本和图像生成任务中，效率和样本质量都得到了一致提升。

Conclusion: 确定性反向过程在离散状态空间中也同样有效，这一简单去随机化方法有望增强离散扩散在生成建模中的重要性。

Abstract: We propose a deterministic denoising algorithm for discrete-state diffusion
models based on Markov chains. The generative reverse process is derandomized
by introducing a variant of the herding algorithm with weakly chaotic dynamics,
which induces deterministic discrete state transitions. Our approach is a
direct replacement for the stochastic denoising process, requiring neither
retraining nor continuous state embeddings. We demonstrate consistent
improvements in both efficiency and sample quality on text and image generation
tasks. Thus, this simple derandomization approach is expected to enhance the
significance of discrete diffusion in generative modeling. Furthermore, our
results reveal that deterministic reverse processes, well established in
continuous diffusion, can also be effective in discrete state spaces.

TL;DR: 开发深度学习框架，结合微观移动特征、历史犯罪和社会人口数据，提升精细时空分辨率下的犯罪预测性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有犯罪预测研究缺乏对微观移动特征的整合，需要探索如何结合多种数据源来提升精细时空尺度下的预测准确性

Method: 使用ConvLSTM深度学习模型，结合犯罪事件数据、社会人口调查数据和人类移动数据，在四个美国城市进行12小时犯罪预测，并与逻辑回归、随机森林和标准LSTM等基线模型比较

Result: 结合移动特征和社会人口特征能获得最佳预测效果，深度学习模型在所有四个城市都取得了最高的召回率、精确率和F1分数，长输入序列对暴力犯罪预测更有效，短序列对财产犯罪更有效

Conclusion: 整合多样化数据源对时空犯罪预测至关重要，深度学习在处理精细时空尺度时具有优势但也存在局限性

Abstract: Objectives: To develop a deep learning framework to evaluate if and how
incorporating micro-level mobility features, alongside historical crime and
sociodemographic data, enhances predictive performance in crime forecasting at
fine-grained spatial and temporal resolutions.
  Methods: We advance the literature on computational methods and crime
forecasting by focusing on four U.S. cities (i.e., Baltimore, Chicago, Los
Angeles, and Philadelphia). We employ crime incident data obtained from each
city's police department, combined with sociodemographic data from the American
Community Survey and human mobility data from Advan, collected from 2019 to
2023. This data is aggregated into grids with equally sized cells of 0.077 sq.
miles (0.2 sq. kms) and used to train our deep learning forecasting model, a
Convolutional Long Short-Term Memory (ConvLSTM) network, which predicts crime
occurrences 12 hours ahead using 14-day and 2-day input sequences. We also
compare its performance against three baseline models: logistic regression,
random forest, and standard LSTM.
  Results: Incorporating mobility features improves predictive performance,
especially when using shorter input sequences. Noteworthy, however, the best
results are obtained when both mobility and sociodemographic features are used
together, with our deep learning model achieving the highest recall, precision,
and F1 score in all four cities, outperforming alternative methods. With this
configuration, longer input sequences enhance predictions for violent crimes,
while shorter sequences are more effective for property crimes.
  Conclusion: These findings underscore the importance of integrating diverse
data sources for spatiotemporal crime forecasting, mobility included. They also
highlight the advantages (and limits) of deep learning when dealing with
fine-grained spatial and temporal scales.

Motivation: 提高重型土方设备（特别是挖掘设备臂架）中线性执行器的能源效率，减少能量损失和环境影响。

Method: 使用MATLAB/Simulink进行液压回路仿真，比较PDCV和PFCV两种方案。PFCV通过在执行器两端之间设置人工泄漏来减少能量损失，采用模糊控制器调谐的PID控制器进行位置控制。

Result: PFCV液压回路比传统PDCV回路能效提高8.5%，通过旁路泵的多余流量减少热量形式的能量损失。

Conclusion: 所提出的PFCV方法可显著提高重型土方设备线性执行器的能效，从而降低环境影响和运营成本。

Abstract: The article focuses on enhancing the energy efficiency of linear actuators
used in heavy earth moving equipment, particularly in the booms ofexcavation
equipment. Two hydraulic circuits are compared in terms of energy efficiency,
with one using a conventional proportional directionalcontrol valve (PDCV) and
the other using an innovative solution of proportional flow control valve
(PFCV) with artificial leakage between thetwo ends of the actuator. The PFCV
reduces energy loss in the form of heat by bypassing the extra flow from the
pump during position control,unlike the PDCV that uses a pressure relief valve.
The hydraulic circuit using PFCV is found to be 8.5% more energy efficient than
theconventional circuit using PDCV. The article also discusses the position
control of the actuator, which is achieved using a PID controller tuned by a
fuzzy controller. Thesimulation of the hydraulic circuit is carried out using
MATLAB/Simulink, and the results are compared with experiments. Overall, the
proposedapproach could lead to significant improvements in the energy
efficiency of linear actuators used in heavy earth moving equipment,
therebyreducing their environmental impact and operating costs.

Motivation: 现有方法为多元时间序列生成的反事实解释往往无效、不合理或不直观，需要一种能够产生合理且用户可理解的反事实解释的方法。

Method: 基于类别判别变分自编码器的生成框架，集成对比学习和分类一致性目标，采用原型初始化和现实约束优化策略。

Result: 在雷达手势数据和手写字母轨迹数据集上，GenFacts在合理性方面比现有最优方法提升18.7%，在人类研究中获得最高的可解释性评分。

Conclusion: 对于时间序列数据的可操作反事实解释，合理性和以用户为中心的可解释性比稀疏性更为关键。

Abstract: Counterfactual explanations aim to enhance model transparency by showing how
inputs can be minimally altered to change predictions. For multivariate time
series, existing methods often generate counterfactuals that are invalid,
implausible, or unintuitive. We introduce GenFacts, a generative framework
based on a class-discriminative variational autoencoder. It integrates
contrastive and classification-consistency objectives, prototype-based
initialization, and realism-constrained optimization. We evaluate GenFacts on
radar gesture data as an industrial use case and handwritten letter
trajectories as an intuitive benchmark. Across both datasets, GenFacts
outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in plausibility (+18.7%) and achieves
the highest interpretability scores in a human study. These results highlight
that plausibility and user-centered interpretability, rather than sparsity
alone, are key to actionable counterfactuals in time series data.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文研究发现Transformer在时间序列预测中表现不佳的原因在于注意力机制失效，Transformer块会退化为简单的MLP，主要原因是当前嵌入方法无法让Transformer在良好结构的潜在空间中工作。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管Transformer在NLP和CV领域表现出色，但在时间序列预测中甚至不如简单线性基线，但之前的研究未能深入探索Transformer失败的原因。

Method: 设计了一系列实验，逐步将Transformer修改为MLP来研究注意力机制的影响；设计了可解释的数据集来分析注意力机制失效的原因；进行了理论分析。

Result: 发现现有的时间序列Transformer中，Transformer块经常退化为简单MLP；注意力机制没有按预期方式工作；当前嵌入方法无法让Transformer在良好结构的潜在空间中工作。

Conclusion: Transformer在时间序列预测中的失败主要源于嵌入方法的缺陷，导致注意力机制失效，使得模型退化为MLP结构。

Abstract: Transformer-based architectures achieved high performance in natural language
processing and computer vision, yet many studies have shown that they have not
demonstrated a clear advantage in time series forecasting and even underperform
simple linear baselines in some cases. However, most of these studies have not
thoroughly explored the reasons behind the failure of transformers. To better
understand time-series transformers(TST), we designed a series of experiments,
progressively modifying transformers into MLPs to investigate the impact of the
attention mechanism. Surprisingly, transformer blocks often degenerate into
simple MLPs in existing time-series transformers. We designed a interpretable
dataset to investigate the reasons behind the failure of the attention
mechanism and revealed that the attention mechanism is not working in the
expected way. We theoretically analyzed the reasons behind this phenomenon,
demonstrating that the current embedding methods fail to allow transformers to
function in a well-structured latent space, and further analyzed the deeper
underlying causes of the failure of embedding.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了解耦值注意力（DVA）方法，用于改进先验数据拟合网络（PFNs）在高维回归任务中的性能，使其能够更有效地替代高斯过程进行快速物理系统建模。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准Transformer注意力在PFNs中对高维回归任务效果有限，而高斯过程具有函数空间完全由输入核表征且预测均值是训练目标加权和的特性，这启发了DVA的设计。

Method: 引入解耦值注意力（DVA），仅从输入计算相似度，通过值传播标签，镜像高斯过程更新但保持无核特性。研究表明注意力规则而非架构本身是扩展PFNs的关键因素。

Result: 局部化注意力在不同维度设置下持续降低PFNs的样本外验证损失，5维和10维情况下验证损失降低超过50%。CNN-based PFNs性能可与Transformer-based相媲美。64维电力流方程近似平均绝对误差达1E-3量级，比精确GP推理快80倍以上。

Conclusion: DVA方法有效提升了PFNs在高维回归任务中的性能，证明了注意力规则对PFNs扩展的重要性大于架构选择，为快速物理系统建模提供了高效替代方案。

Abstract: Prior-data fitted networks (PFNs) are a promising alternative to
time-consuming Gaussian Process (GP) inference for creating fast surrogates of
physical systems. PFN reduces the computational burden of GP-training by
replacing Bayesian inference in GP with a single forward pass of a learned
prediction model. However, with standard Transformer attention, PFNs show
limited effectiveness on high-dimensional regression tasks. We introduce
Decoupled-Value Attention (DVA)-- motivated by the GP property that the
function space is fully characterized by the kernel over inputs and the
predictive mean is a weighted sum of training targets. DVA computes
similarities from inputs only and propagates labels solely through values.
Thus, the proposed DVA mirrors the Gaussian-process update while remaining
kernel-free. We demonstrate that the crucial factor for scaling PFNs is the
attention rule rather than the architecture itself. Specifically, our results
demonstrate that (a) localized attention consistently reduces out-of-sample
validation loss in PFNs across different dimensional settings, with validation
loss reduced by more than 50% in five- and ten-dimensional cases, and (b) the
role of attention is more decisive than the choice of backbone architecture,
showing that CNN-based PFNs can perform at par with their Transformer-based
counterparts. The proposed PFNs provide 64-dimensional power flow equation
approximations with a mean absolute error of the order of 1E-3, while being
over 80x faster than exact GP inference.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文揭示了流匹配方法在低噪声区域存在不稳定性问题，并提出了一种混合训练协议LCF来解决这一问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 流匹配框架在低噪声区域存在基本不稳定性，当噪声水平趋近于零时，输入的微小扰动会导致速度目标的巨大变化，使学习问题的条件数发散。这种病态性不仅减缓优化过程，还迫使编码器将有限的雅可比容量重新分配到噪声方向，从而降低语义表示质量。

Method: 提出了局部对比流（LCF），这是一种混合训练协议，在小噪声水平下用对比特征对齐替代直接速度回归，同时在中高噪声水平下保留标准流匹配。

Result: 实证结果表明，LCF不仅提高了收敛速度，还稳定了表示质量。

Conclusion: 研究强调了解决低噪声病态性对于充分发挥流匹配在生成和表示学习方面潜力的关键重要性。

Abstract: Flow matching has recently emerged as a powerful alternative to diffusion
models, providing a continuous-time formulation for generative modeling and
representation learning. Yet, we show that this framework suffers from a
fundamental instability in the low-noise regime. As noise levels approach zero,
arbitrarily small perturbations in the input can induce large variations in the
velocity target, causing the condition number of the learning problem to
diverge. This ill-conditioning not only slows optimization but also forces the
encoder to reallocate its limited Jacobian capacity toward noise directions,
thereby degrading semantic representations. We provide the first theoretical
analysis of this phenomenon, which we term the low-noise pathology,
establishing its intrinsic link to the structure of the flow matching
objective. Building on these insights, we propose Local Contrastive Flow (LCF),
a hybrid training protocol that replaces direct velocity regression with
contrastive feature alignment at small noise levels, while retaining standard
flow matching at moderate and high noise. Empirically, LCF not only improves
convergence speed but also stabilizes representation quality. Our findings
highlight the critical importance of addressing low-noise pathologies to unlock
the full potential of flow matching for both generation and representation
learning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多视图布尔电路学习具有巨大潜力，但不同视图（如AIG与XMG）之间的结构异质性阻碍了有效融合，特别是对于掩码建模等自监督技术，跨视图上下文被误认为是噪声

Method: 提出MixGate框架，采用原则性训练课程：首先通过等价对齐损失教导模型学习共享的功能感知表示空间，然后引入多视图掩码建模目标，利用对齐视图作为丰富的互补信号

Result: 大量实验（包括关键消融研究）证明，对齐优先策略成功地将掩码建模从无效技术转变为强大的性能驱动因素

Conclusion: 功能对齐是多视图自监督学习的必要前提条件，只有在视图对齐后才能有效利用多视图掩码建模的互补信号优势

Abstract: Multiview learning on Boolean circuits holds immense promise, as different
graph-based representations offer complementary structural and semantic
information. However, the vast structural heterogeneity between views, such as
an And-Inverter Graph (AIG) versus an XOR-Majority Graph (XMG), poses a
critical barrier to effective fusion, especially for self-supervised techniques
like masked modeling. Naively applying such methods fails, as the cross-view
context is perceived as noise. Our key insight is that functional alignment is
a necessary precondition to unlock the power of multiview self-supervision. We
introduce MixGate, a framework built on a principled training curriculum that
first teaches the model a shared, function-aware representation space via an
Equivalence Alignment Loss. Only then do we introduce a multiview masked
modeling objective, which can now leverage the aligned views as a rich,
complementary signal. Extensive experiments, including a crucial ablation
study, demonstrate that our alignment-first strategy transforms masked modeling
from an ineffective technique into a powerful performance driver.

Motivation: 个性化医疗需要基于患者个人基因和环境因素优化治疗方案，但现有替代模型难以泛化到未见过的患者-治疗组合，而领域特定先验知识可以提供有意义的替代信号。

Method: LEON采用基于提示的优化方法，将LLMs作为随机引擎提出治疗设计，无需任务特定微调，利用其上下文理解非结构化领域知识的能力。

Result: 在真实世界优化任务上的实验表明，LEON在提出个体化治疗方案方面优于传统方法和基于LLM的方法。

Conclusion: LEON提供了一种数学上严谨的方法，能够有效利用LLMs和领域知识来优化个性化治疗计划。

Abstract: The goal of personalized medicine is to discover a treatment regimen that
optimizes a patient's clinical outcome based on their personal genetic and
environmental factors. However, candidate treatments cannot be arbitrarily
administered to the patient to assess their efficacy; we often instead have
access to an in silico surrogate model that approximates the true fitness of a
proposed treatment. Unfortunately, such surrogate models have been shown to
fail to generalize to previously unseen patient-treatment combinations. We
hypothesize that domain-specific prior knowledge - such as medical textbooks
and biomedical knowledge graphs - can provide a meaningful alternative signal
of the fitness of proposed treatments. To this end, we introduce LLM-based
Entropy-guided Optimization with kNowledgeable priors (LEON), a mathematically
principled approach to leverage large language models (LLMs) as black-box
optimizers without any task-specific fine-tuning, taking advantage of their
ability to contextualize unstructured domain knowledge to propose personalized
treatment plans in natural language. In practice, we implement LEON via
'optimization by prompting,' which uses LLMs as stochastic engines for
proposing treatment designs. Experiments on real-world optimization tasks show
LEON outperforms both traditional and LLM-based methods in proposing
individualized treatments for patients.

Motivation: 现有基于定位的方法无法区分负责遗忘不良知识和保留必要技能的神经元，将它们视为单一纠缠组，导致统一干预可能造成灾难性过度遗忘或目标知识不完全擦除。

Method: 采用机制可解释性技术中的电路发现方法，识别遗忘和保留电路，将其转化为合取范式（CNF），根据可满足性解确定每个神经元应被遗忘还是保留，并为不同类别神经元提供针对性微调策略。

Conclusion: CLUE框架通过解耦遗忘和保留电路，为LLM遗忘提供了更精确和有效的解决方案，避免了现有方法的过度遗忘或擦除不完全问题。

Abstract: The LLM unlearning aims to eliminate the influence of undesirable data
without affecting causally unrelated information. This process typically
involves using a forget set to remove target information, alongside a retain
set to maintain non-target capabilities. While recent localization-based
methods demonstrate promise in identifying important neurons to be unlearned,
they fail to disentangle neurons responsible for forgetting undesirable
knowledge or retaining essential skills, often treating them as a single
entangled group. As a result, these methods apply uniform interventions,
risking catastrophic over-forgetting or incomplete erasure of the target
knowledge. To address this, we turn to circuit discovery, a mechanistic
interpretability technique, and propose the Conflict-guided Localization for
LLM Unlearning framEwork (CLUE). This framework identifies the forget and
retain circuit composed of important neurons, and then the circuits are
transformed into conjunctive normal forms (CNF). The assignment of each neuron
in the CNF satisfiability solution reveals whether it should be forgotten or
retained. We then provide targeted fine-tuning strategies for different
categories of neurons. Extensive experiments demonstrate that, compared to
existing localization methods, CLUE achieves superior forget efficacy and
retain utility through precise neural localization.

Conclusion: FracAug作为一个模型无关的模块，具有显著的通用性和有效性，能够显著提升图级异常检测性能

Abstract: Graph-level anomaly detection (GAD) is critical in diverse domains such as
drug discovery, yet high labeling costs and dataset imbalance hamper the
performance of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). To address these issues, we
propose FracAug, an innovative plug-in augmentation framework that enhances
GNNs by generating semantically consistent graph variants and pseudo-labeling
with mutual verification. Unlike previous heuristic methods, FracAug learns
semantics within given graphs and synthesizes fractional variants, guided by a
novel weighted distance-aware margin loss. This captures multi-scale topology
to generate diverse, semantic-preserving graphs unaffected by data imbalance.
Then, FracAug utilizes predictions from both original and augmented graphs to
pseudo-label unlabeled data, iteratively expanding the training set. As a
model-agnostic module compatible with various GNNs, FracAug demonstrates
remarkable universality and efficacy: experiments across 14 GNNs on 12
real-world datasets show consistent gains, boosting average AUROC, AUPRC, and
F1-score by up to 5.72%, 7.23%, and 4.18%, respectively.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代GPU推理中缓存效率是主要瓶颈，推荐模型中的嵌入命中率和大型语言模型中的KV缓存未命中严重影响性能。现有启发式策略在结构化访问模式下表现不佳，而基于学习的方法存在预测不准确时性能急剧下降或保守设计收益有限的问题。

Conclusion: LCR在基于学习的缓存领域架起了实证进展与理论进展之间的桥梁，提供了性能增益的同时确保鲁棒性和效率。

Abstract: In modern GPU inference, cache efficiency remains a major bottleneck. In
recommendation models, embedding hit rates largely determine throughput, while
in large language models, KV-cache misses substantially increase
time-to-first-token (TTFT). Heuristic policies such as \textsc{LRU} often
struggle under structured access patterns. Learning-based approaches are
promising, but in practice face two major limitations: they degrade sharply
when predictions are inaccurate, or they gain little even with accurate
predictions due to conservative designs. Some also incur high overhead, further
limiting practicality.
  We present \textsc{LCR}, a practical framework for learning-based GPU caching
that delivers performance gains while ensuring robustness and efficiency. Its
core algorithm, \textsc{LARU}, enhances \textsc{LRU} with machine-learned
predictions and dynamically adapts to prediction accuracy through online error
estimation. When predictions are accurate, \textsc{LARU} achieves near-optimal
performance. With inaccurate predictions, it degrades gracefully to
near-\textsc{LRU} performance. With \textsc{LCR}, we bridge the gap between
empirical progress and theoretical advances in learning-based caching.
  Experiments show that \textsc{LCR} delivers consistent gains under realistic
conditions. In DLRM and LLM scenarios, it improves throughput by up to 24.2\%
and reduces P99 TTFT by up to 28.3\%, outperforming widely used inference
systems. Even under poor predictions, its performance remains stable,
demonstrating practical robustness.

Abstract: We consider the problem of estimating inverse temperature parameter $\beta$
of an $n$-dimensional truncated Ising model using a single sample. Given a
graph $G = (V,E)$ with $n$ vertices, a truncated Ising model is a probability
distribution over the $n$-dimensional hypercube $\{-1,1\}^n$ where each
configuration $\mathbf{\sigma}$ is constrained to lie in a truncation set $S
\subseteq \{-1,1\}^n$ and has probability $\Pr(\mathbf{\sigma}) \propto
\exp(\beta\mathbf{\sigma}^\top A\mathbf{\sigma})$ with $A$ being the adjacency
matrix of $G$. We adopt the recent setting of [Galanis et al. SODA'24], where
the truncation set $S$ can be expressed as the set of satisfying assignments of
a $k$-SAT formula. Given a single sample $\mathbf{\sigma}$ from a truncated
Ising model, with inverse parameter $\beta^*$, underlying graph $G$ of bounded
degree $\Delta$ and $S$ being expressed as the set of satisfying assignments of
a $k$-SAT formula, we design in nearly $O(n)$ time an estimator $\hat{\beta}$
that is $O(\Delta^3/\sqrt{n})$-consistent with the true parameter $\beta^*$ for
$k \gtrsim \log(d^2k)\Delta^3.$
  Our estimator is based on the maximization of the pseudolikelihood, a notion
that has received extensive analysis for various probabilistic models without
[Chatterjee, Annals of Statistics '07] or with truncation [Galanis et al. SODA
'24]. Our approach generalizes recent techniques from [Daskalakis et al. STOC
'19, Galanis et al. SODA '24], to confront the more challenging setting of the
truncated Ising model.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为二元自编码器（BAE）的新方法，通过在小批量隐藏激活上施加最小熵约束，促进特征独立性和稀疏性，解决了现有方法中特征稠密化的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常依赖自编码器，但缺乏对全局稀疏性的显式保证，导致大量稠密特征，损害了特征的稀疏性和原子化。

Method: 提出BAE方法：通过步进函数将隐藏激活离散化为1位，应用梯度估计实现反向传播，在小批量隐藏激活上施加最小熵约束。

Result: BAE能够可靠估计特征集熵，有效表征LLM的推理动态和上下文学习；在特征解缠方面，BAE避免了稠密特征，产生了最多的可解释特征。

Conclusion: BAE作为一种特征提取器具有有效性，能够促进特征独立性和稀疏性，为LLM机制解释提供了新工具。

Abstract: Existing works are dedicated to untangling atomized numerical components
(features) from the hidden states of Large Language Models (LLMs) for
interpreting their mechanism. However, they typically rely on autoencoders
constrained by some implicit training-time regularization on single training
instances (i.e., $L_1$ normalization, top-k function, etc.), without an
explicit guarantee of global sparsity among instances, causing a large amount
of dense (simultaneously inactive) features, harming the feature sparsity and
atomization. In this paper, we propose a novel autoencoder variant that
enforces minimal entropy on minibatches of hidden activations, thereby
promoting feature independence and sparsity across instances. For efficient
entropy calculation, we discretize the hidden activations to 1-bit via a step
function and apply gradient estimation to enable backpropagation, so that we
term it as Binary Autoencoder (BAE) and empirically demonstrate two major
applications: (1) Feature set entropy calculation. Entropy can be reliably
estimated on binary hidden activations, which we empirically evaluate and
leverage to characterize the inference dynamics of LLMs and In-context
Learning. (2) Feature untangling. Similar to typical methods, BAE can extract
atomized features from LLM's hidden states. To robustly evaluate such feature
extraction capability, we refine traditional feature-interpretation methods to
avoid unreliable handling of numerical tokens, and show that BAE avoids dense
features while producing the largest number of interpretable ones among
baselines, which confirms the effectiveness of BAE serving as a feature
extractor.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于局部唯一标识符（Local-UID）的图神经网络方法来解决整数线性规划问题，通过d跳邻域内的唯一着色方案，在保持表达力的同时提升泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准匿名图神经网络在整数线性规划问题中的表达能力有限，而全局唯一标识符方法容易引入虚假相关性，严重损害泛化性能。需要一种平衡表达力和泛化能力的新方法。

Method: 提出了基于d跳唯一着色的局部唯一标识符方案，确保标识符仅在节点的d跳邻域内唯一。基于此方案开发了ColorGNN（通过颜色条件嵌入整合颜色信息）和ColorUID（轻量级特征级变体）。

Result: 实验表明该方法在三个ILP基准测试中取得显著提升，在线性规划数据集上表现出强大的OOD泛化能力，并且与最先进方法结合时能进一步提升图级任务的性能。

Conclusion: 局部唯一标识符方案在d层网络中能够达到全局唯一标识符的表达能力，同时提供更强的泛化性能，为解决整数线性规划问题提供了有效的学习优化方法。

Abstract: Integer Linear Programs (ILPs) are central to real-world optimizations but
notoriously difficult to solve. Learning to Optimize (L2O) has emerged as a
promising paradigm, with Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) serving as the standard
backbone. However, standard anonymous GNNs are limited in expressiveness for
ILPs, and the common enhancement of augmenting nodes with globally unique
identifiers (UIDs) typically introduces spurious correlations that severely
harm generalization. To address this tradeoff, we propose a parsimonious
Local-UID scheme based on d-hop uniqueness coloring, which ensures identifiers
are unique only within each node's d-hop neighborhood. Building on this scheme,
we introduce ColorGNN, which incorporates color information via
color-conditioned embeddings, and ColorUID, a lightweight feature-level
variant. We prove that for d-layer networks, Local-UIDs achieve the expressive
power of Global-UIDs while offering stronger generalization. Extensive
experiments show that our approach (i) yields substantial gains on three ILP
benchmarks, (ii) exhibits strong OOD generalization on linear programming
datasets, and (iii) further improves a general graph-level task when paired
with a state-of-the-art method.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统时间序列模型评估主要关注预测、插补、异常检测和分类等任务，但这些任务主要评估特定任务性能，无法严格衡量模型是否真正捕捉数据的生成分布。

Method: 定义了标准化评估协议和指标，开发了TSCom-Bench评估框架，能够快速将时间序列模型适配为无损压缩的骨干网络。

Result: 在多个数据集上对TimeXer、iTransformer、PatchTST等先进模型的实验表明，压缩评估能够揭示传统基准测试忽略的分布建模弱点。

Conclusion: 无损压缩作为一个原则性任务，能够补充和扩展现有时间序列建模的评估方法。

Abstract: The evaluation of time series models has traditionally focused on four
canonical tasks: forecasting, imputation, anomaly detection, and
classification. While these tasks have driven significant progress, they
primarily assess task-specific performance and do not rigorously measure
whether a model captures the full generative distribution of the data. We
introduce lossless compression as a new paradigm for evaluating time series
models, grounded in Shannon's source coding theorem. This perspective
establishes a direct equivalence between optimal compression length and the
negative log-likelihood, providing a strict and unified information-theoretic
criterion for modeling capacity. Then We define a standardized evaluation
protocol and metrics. We further propose and open-source a comprehensive
evaluation framework TSCom-Bench, which enables the rapid adaptation of time
series models as backbones for lossless compression. Experiments across diverse
datasets on state-of-the-art models, including TimeXer, iTransformer, and
PatchTST, demonstrate that compression reveals distributional weaknesses
overlooked by classic benchmarks. These findings position lossless compression
as a principled task that complements and extends existing evaluation for time
series modeling.

Motivation: 多智能体飞行轨迹预测对于理解当前空中交通流至关重要，但存在两大挑战：一是建模个体飞机行为随时间的变化和复杂交互，二是生成可解释的预测结果。

Method: MAIFormer框架包含两个关键注意力模块：(i) 掩码多变量注意力，捕获个体飞机的时空模式；(ii) 智能体注意力，建模复杂空中交通场景中多智能体之间的社交模式。

Result: 在韩国仁川国际机场终端空域的真实自动相关监视广播飞行轨迹数据集上评估，MAIFormer在多个指标上均取得最佳性能，优于其他方法。

Conclusion: MAIFormer不仅性能优越，还能从人类视角产生可解释的预测结果，提高了模型的透明度和在空管中的实际应用价值。

Abstract: Flight trajectory prediction for multiple aircraft is essential and provides
critical insights into how aircraft navigate within current air traffic flows.
However, predicting multi-agent flight trajectories is inherently challenging.
One of the major difficulties is modeling both the individual aircraft
behaviors over time and the complex interactions between flights. Generating
explainable prediction outcomes is also a challenge. Therefore, we propose a
Multi-Agent Inverted Transformer, MAIFormer, as a novel neural architecture
that predicts multi-agent flight trajectories. The proposed framework features
two key attention modules: (i) masked multivariate attention, which captures
spatio-temporal patterns of individual aircraft, and (ii) agent attention,
which models the social patterns among multiple agents in complex air traffic
scenes. We evaluated MAIFormer using a real-world automatic dependent
surveillance-broadcast flight trajectory dataset from the terminal airspace of
Incheon International Airport in South Korea. The experimental results show
that MAIFormer achieves the best performance across multiple metrics and
outperforms other methods. In addition, MAIFormer produces prediction outcomes
that are interpretable from a human perspective, which improves both the
transparency of the model and its practical utility in air traffic control.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于表型和基于靶点的策略各有局限性，要么实验成本高，要么忽视系统级细胞反应。为了弥补这一差距，需要开发能够协同整合表型和靶点特异性线索的方法。

Method: 表型引导的生成器首先在广泛的药物诱导转录谱上进行预训练，然后通过多目标强化学习进行微调。奖励函数融合对接亲和力和药物相似性评分，并增加了排序损失、先验似然正则化和熵最大化。

Result: 广泛的实验表明，ExMoIRL在多个特征明确的靶点上优于最先进的基于表型和基于靶点的模型。生成的分子表现出良好的药物样性质、高靶点亲和力和对癌细胞的抑制效力（IC50）。

Conclusion: 这个统一框架展示了结合表型引导和靶点感知策略的协同潜力，为从头药物发现提供了更有效的解决方案。

Abstract: The generation of high-quality candidate molecules remains a central
challenge in AI-driven drug design. Current phenotype-based and target-based
strategies each suffer limitations, either incurring high experimental costs or
overlook system-level cellular responses. To bridge this gap, we propose
ExMoIRL, a novel generative framework that synergistically integrates
phenotypic and target-specific cues for de novo molecular generation. The
phenotype-guided generator is first pretrained on expansive drug-induced
transcriptional profiles and subsequently fine-tuned via multi-objective
reinforcement learning (RL). Crucially, the reward function fuses docking
affinity and drug-likeness scores, augmented with ranking loss,
prior-likelihood regularization, and entropy maximization. The multi-objective
RL steers the model toward chemotypes that are simultaneously potent, diverse,
and aligned with the specified phenotypic effects. Extensive experiments
demonstrate ExMoIRL's superior performance over state-of-the-art
phenotype-based and target-based models across multiple well-characterized
targets. Our generated molecules exhibit favorable drug-like properties, high
target affinity, and inhibitory potency (IC50) against cancer cells. This
unified framework showcases the synergistic potential of combining
phenotype-guided and target-aware strategies, offering a more effective
solution for de novo drug discovery.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Error


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: In-context Learning (ICL) is an emerging few-shot learning paradigm based on
modern Language Models (LMs), yet its inner mechanism remains unclear. In this
paper, we investigate the mechanism through a novel perspective of information
removal. Specifically, we demonstrate that in the zero-shot scenario, LMs
encode queries into non-selective representations in hidden states containing
information for all possible tasks, leading to arbitrary outputs without
focusing on the intended task, resulting in near-zero accuracy. Meanwhile, we
find that selectively removing specific information from hidden states by a
low-rank filter effectively steers LMs toward the intended task. Building on
these findings, by measuring the hidden states on carefully designed metrics,
we observe that few-shot ICL effectively simulates such task-oriented
information removal processes, selectively removing the redundant information
from entangled non-selective representations, and improving the output based on
the demonstrations, which constitutes a key mechanism underlying ICL. Moreover,
we identify essential attention heads inducing the removal operation, termed
Denoising Heads, which enables the ablation experiments blocking the
information removal operation from the inference, where the ICL accuracy
significantly degrades, especially when the correct label is absent from the
few-shot demonstrations, confirming both the critical role of the information
removal mechanism and denoising heads.

TL;DR: rBridge是一种方法，通过使用小模型（≤1B参数）来预测大模型（7B+参数）的推理能力，从而大幅降低数据集优化的成本。该方法通过将负对数似然与任务对齐加权，利用前沿模型的推理轨迹作为黄金标签，实现了100倍以上的成本降低和最强的相关性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预训练大型语言模型的成本过高，需要利用小模型来优化数据集。但推理能力只在较大模型规模（通常超过7B参数）中可靠地出现，这使得小模型难以预测大模型的推理性能。

Method: rBridge通过将负对数似然与任务对齐加权，使用前沿模型的推理轨迹作为黄金标签，使小模型（≤1B）能够更接近地预测大模型的推理能力。该方法关注预训练目标和目标任务的更紧密对齐。

Result: rBridge在实验中：（i）相对于最佳基线将数据集排名成本降低了100倍以上；（ii）在1B到32B规模的六个推理基准上实现了最强的相关性；（iii）在1B到7B规模上实现了预测关系的零样本跨预训练数据集迁移。

Conclusion: rBridge为以较低成本探索面向推理的预训练提供了一条实用路径，表明小代理模型可以有效地预测大模型的推理能力。

Abstract: Given the prohibitive cost of pre-training large language models, it is
essential to leverage smaller proxy models to optimize datasets before scaling
up. However, this approach becomes challenging for reasoning capabilities,
which exhibit emergent behavior that only appear reliably at larger model
sizes, often exceeding 7B parameters. To address this, we introduce rBridge,
showing that small proxies ($\leq$1B) can effectively predict large-model
reasoning by aligning more closely with (1) the pre-training objective and (2)
the target task. rBridge achieves this by weighting negative log-likelihood
with task alignment, using reasoning traces from frontier models as gold
labels. In our experiments, rBridge (i) reduces dataset ranking costs by over
100x relative to the best baseline, (ii) achieves the strongest correlation
across six reasoning benchmarks at 1B to 32B scale, and (iii) zero-shot
transfers predictive relationships across pre-training datasets at 1B to 7B
scale. These findings indicate that rBridge offers a practical path for
exploring reasoning-oriented pre-training at lower cost.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLMs是否能真正学习和泛化新推理策略这一开放性问题，而不仅仅是依赖预训练中已掌握的技能。

Method: 通过模板化问题生成器创建合成编码问题家族，使用强化学习训练模型，并探索分阶段预热、经验回放、课程训练等关键训练要素。

Result: 模型在学习性方面表现出明显的顿悟现象，在家族内和技能重组方面有显著提升，但在转换性案例中仍存在持续弱点。

Conclusion: DELTA提供了一个清晰的测试平台，用于探索RL驱动推理的极限，理解模型如何超越现有先验知识获取新算法技能。

Abstract: It remains an open question whether LLMs can acquire or generalize genuinely
new reasoning strategies, beyond the sharpened skills encoded in their
parameters during pre-training or post-training. To attempt to answer this
debate, we introduce DELTA-Code--Distributional Evaluation of Learnability and
Transferrability in Algorithmic Coding, a controlled benchmark of synthetic
coding problem families designed to probe two fundamental aspects: learnability
-- can LLMs, through reinforcement learning (RL), solve problem families where
pretrained models exhibit failure with large enough attempts (pass@K=0)? --and
transferrability -- if learnability happens, can such skills transfer
systematically to out-of-distribution (OOD) test sets? Unlike prior public
coding datasets, DELTA isolates reasoning skills through templated problem
generators and introduces fully OOD problem families that demand novel
strategies rather than tool invocation or memorized patterns. Our experiments
reveal a striking grokking phase transition: after an extended period with
near-zero reward, RL-trained models abruptly climb to near-perfect accuracy. To
enable learnability on previously unsolvable problem families, we explore key
training ingredients such as staged warm-up with dense rewards, experience
replay, curriculum training, and verification-in-the-loop. Beyond learnability,
we use DELTA to evaluate transferability or generalization along exploratory,
compositional, and transformative axes, as well as cross-family transfer.
Results show solid gains within families and for recomposed skills, but
persistent weaknesses in transformative cases. DELTA thus offers a clean
testbed for probing the limits of RL-driven reasoning and for understanding how
models can move beyond existing priors to acquire new algorithmic skills.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于约束的因果发现需要大量条件独立性测试，计算成本极高，限制了实际应用。特别是CIT本身对样本大小具有高时间复杂度。

Method: 采用分治策略：将数据划分为子集，在每个子集上独立应用基础CIT，然后使用基于稳定分布特性的新方法聚合得到的p值。

Result: E-CIT将基础CIT的计算复杂度降低到样本大小的线性级别（当子集大小固定时），在保持理论一致性的同时显著减少了计算负担。

Conclusion: 实验结果表明E-CIT不仅显著降低了CIT和因果发现的计算负担，而且在复杂测试场景中表现出竞争力，特别是在真实世界数据集上有所改进。

Abstract: Constraint-based causal discovery relies on numerous conditional independence
tests (CITs), but its practical applicability is severely constrained by the
prohibitive computational cost, especially as CITs themselves have high time
complexity with respect to the sample size. To address this key bottleneck, we
introduce the Ensemble Conditional Independence Test (E-CIT), a general and
plug-and-play framework. E-CIT operates on an intuitive divide-and-aggregate
strategy: it partitions the data into subsets, applies a given base CIT
independently to each subset, and aggregates the resulting p-values using a
novel method grounded in the properties of stable distributions. This framework
reduces the computational complexity of a base CIT to linear in the sample size
when the subset size is fixed. Moreover, our tailored p-value combination
method offers theoretical consistency guarantees under mild conditions on the
subtests. Experimental results demonstrate that E-CIT not only significantly
reduces the computational burden of CITs and causal discovery but also achieves
competitive performance. Notably, it exhibits an improvement in complex testing
scenarios, particularly on real-world datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统actor-critic方法依赖分离的actor和critic网络，训练复杂且对架构决策敏感；扩散模型虽能表达多模态行为但带来额外设计负担。

Method: ACA框架消除显式actor网络，直接从critic的梯度场生成动作，保持策略改进与critic最新价值估计紧密对齐。

Result: 在标准在线RL基准测试中，ACA相比标准actor-critic和扩散方法实现了更优的学习曲线和竞争性能。

Conclusion: ACA提供了一个简单而强大的在线RL解决方案，结合了简洁性和表达能力。

Abstract: Actor-critic methods constitute a central paradigm in reinforcement learning
(RL), coupling policy evaluation with policy improvement. While effective
across many domains, these methods rely on separate actor and critic networks,
which makes training vulnerable to architectural decisions and hyperparameter
tuning. Such complexity limits their scalability in settings that require large
function approximators. Recently, diffusion models have recently been proposed
as expressive policies that capture multi-modal behaviors and improve
exploration, but they introduce additional design choices and computational
burdens, hindering efficient deployment. We introduce Actor-Critic without
Actor (ACA), a lightweight framework that eliminates the explicit actor network
and instead generates actions directly from the gradient field of a noise-level
critic. This design removes the algorithmic and computational overhead of actor
training while keeping policy improvement tightly aligned with the critic's
latest value estimates. Moreover, ACA retains the ability to capture diverse,
multi-modal behaviors without relying on diffusion-based actors, combining
simplicity with expressiveness. Through extensive experiments on standard
online RL benchmarks,ACA achieves more favorable learning curves and
competitive performance compared to both standard actor-critic and
state-of-the-art diffusion-based methods, providing a simple yet powerful
solution for online RL.

TL;DR: 该论文分析了多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）中视觉越狱攻击的局限性，发现现有攻击方法在跨模型迁移时效果不佳，原因是攻击位于高锐度区域，对参数变化敏感。作者提出了FORCE方法来纠正对特定层特征和频率特征的过度依赖，从而提升攻击的跨模型迁移能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视觉越狱攻击虽然能有效攻击开源MLLMs，但在跨模型迁移到闭源MLLMs时效果有限。需要深入理解攻击失效的原因并开发更通用的攻击方法。

Method: 提出FORCE方法：1）分析攻击在损失景观中的位置特征；2）通过引导攻击探索更广泛的可行区域；3）根据语义内容重新缩放频率特征的影响；4）消除对层特征和频谱特征的非泛化依赖。

Result: 实验表明FORCE方法能有效发现平坦的可行区域，显著提升视觉越狱攻击在闭源MLLMs上的跨模型迁移能力。

Conclusion: 通过纠正对特定特征的过度依赖，可以开发出更具泛化能力的视觉越狱攻击方法，为闭源MLLMs的红队评估提供有效工具。

Abstract: The integration of new modalities enhances the capabilities of multimodal
large language models (MLLMs) but also introduces additional vulnerabilities.
In particular, simple visual jailbreaking attacks can manipulate open-source
MLLMs more readily than sophisticated textual attacks. However, these
underdeveloped attacks exhibit extremely limited cross-model transferability,
failing to reliably identify vulnerabilities in closed-source MLLMs. In this
work, we analyse the loss landscape of these jailbreaking attacks and find that
the generated attacks tend to reside in high-sharpness regions, whose
effectiveness is highly sensitive to even minor parameter changes during
transfer. To further explain the high-sharpness localisations, we analyse their
feature representations in both the intermediate layers and the spectral
domain, revealing an improper reliance on narrow layer representations and
semantically poor frequency components. Building on this, we propose a Feature
Over-Reliance CorrEction (FORCE) method, which guides the attack to explore
broader feasible regions across layer features and rescales the influence of
frequency features according to their semantic content. By eliminating
non-generalizable reliance on both layer and spectral features, our method
discovers flattened feasible regions for visual jailbreaking attacks, thereby
improving cross-model transferability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
our approach effectively facilitates visual red-teaming evaluations against
closed-source MLLMs.

Motivation: 探索RL微调如何增强LLM能力的内部机制，特别是针对不同内在特性的模型，当前这一领域的研究还不够深入。

Method: 采用边缘归因修补(EAP)技术，对比分析多个模型家族在RL微调前后的内部差异，重点关注PPO、GRPO和DPO等不同RL方法的效果。

Result: 发现在线RL后训练产生两个稳健效应：1)整体激活强度增加，表明更多内部通路被激活；2)激活模式多样性提高，表现为更高熵值和更分散的边缘分布。DPO方法则显示出较弱或不一致的内部变化。

Conclusion: RL通过重塑信息流使其更具冗余性和灵活性，这解释了其泛化优势。研究为RL微调如何系统改变LLM内部电路提供了统一视角，并凸显了在线RL与基于偏好方法的方法学差异。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) acquire extensive prior knowledge through
large-scale pretraining and can be further enhanced via supervised fine-tuning
(SFT) or reinforcement learning (RL)-based post-training. A growing body of
evidence has shown that RL fine-tuning improves the capability of LLMs beyond
what SFT alone achieves. However, the underlying mechanisms why RL fine-tuning
is able to enhance the capability of various LLMs with distinct intrinsic
characteristics remain underexplored. In this study, we draw inspiration from
prior work on edge attribution patching (EAP) to investigate the internal
differences of LLMs before and after RL fine-tuning. Our analysis across
multiple model families shows two robust effects of online RL post-training:
(i) an overall increase in activation intensity, indicating that more internal
pathways are engaged and their signals become stronger, and (ii) greater
diversity in activation patterns, reflected by higher entropy and less
concentrated edge distributions. These changes suggest that RL reshapes
information flow to be both more redundant and more flexible, which may explain
its advantage in generalization. Notably, models fine-tuned with Direct
Preference Optimization (DPO) deviate from these trends, exhibiting
substantially weaker or inconsistent internal changes compared to PPO- and
GRPO-based training. Together, our findings provide a unified view of how RL
fine-tuning systematically alters the internal circuitry of LLMs and highlight
the methodological distinctions between online RL and preference-based
approaches. Our code is open source at

Abstract: We study the problem of building an efficient learning system. Efficient
learning processes information in the least time, i.e., building a system that
reaches a desired error threshold with the least number of observations.
Building upon least action principles from physics, we derive classic learning
algorithms, Bellman's optimality equation in reinforcement learning, and the
Adam optimizer in generative models from first principles, i.e., the Learning
$\textit{Lagrangian}$. We postulate that learning searches for stationary paths
in the Lagrangian, and learning algorithms are derivable by seeking the
stationary trajectories.

<details>

Abstract: AI-driven geometric problem solving is a complex vision-language task that
requires accurate diagram interpretation, mathematical reasoning, and robust
cross-modal grounding. A foundational yet underexplored capability for this
task is the ability to identify and interpret geometric elements based on
natural language queries. To address this, we introduce the task of Referring
Expression Comprehension (REC) for geometric problems, which evaluates whether
models can localize points, shapes, and spatial relations in diagrams in
response to textual prompts. We present GeoRef, a benchmark dataset constructed
from existing geometric problem corpora, featuring diverse, high-quality
annotations and queries. Due to the lack of annotated data for this task, we
generate a large-scale synthetic training dataset using a structured geometric
formal language, enabling broad coverage of geometric concepts and facilitating
model adaptation. We explore two fine-tuning approaches: Supervised Fine-Tuning
(SFT) and Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). Our results show that GRPO
significantly outperforms SFT by better aligning model behavior with
task-specific rewards. Furthermore, we propose a verify-and-regenerate
mechanism that detects incorrect predictions and re-infers answers using
contextual reasoning history, further boosting accuracy. Notably, even
state-of-the-art Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) struggle with this
task, underscoring the necessity of explicitly evaluating and strengthening
geometric grounding as a prerequisite for robust geometric problem solving.
Moreover, models trained on GeoRef demonstrate measurable improvements on
downstream geometric reasoning tasks, highlighting the broader value of REC as
a foundation for multimodal mathematical understanding.

Motivation: 解决大规模高成本多目标优化问题中Pareto最优解集计算效率低下的挑战

Method: 首先学习决策空间采样点的条件扩散过程，然后在每个反向扩散步骤中，通过自适应多重梯度下降更新实现快速收敛，同时使用高斯RBF排斥项保证多样性

Result: 在多目标优化基准测试中，SPREAD在离线设置和贝叶斯代理模型设置下，在效率、可扩展性和Pareto前沿覆盖度方面达到或超过了领先基线方法

Conclusion: SPREAD框架为大规模昂贵多目标优化问题提供了一种高效的解决方案

Abstract: Developing efficient multi-objective optimization methods to compute the
Pareto set of optimal compromises between conflicting objectives remains a key
challenge, especially for large-scale and expensive problems. To bridge this
gap, we introduce SPREAD, a generative framework based on Denoising Diffusion
Probabilistic Models (DDPMs). SPREAD first learns a conditional diffusion
process over points sampled from the decision space and then, at each reverse
diffusion step, refines candidates via a sampling scheme that uses an adaptive
multiple gradient descent-inspired update for fast convergence alongside a
Gaussian RBF-based repulsion term for diversity. Empirical results on
multi-objective optimization benchmarks, including offline and Bayesian
surrogate-based settings, show that SPREAD matches or exceeds leading baselines
in efficiency, scalability, and Pareto front coverage.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统图域自适应方法主要关注节点属性转换和对齐，但难以处理不同图域之间的结构异质性，导致分布对齐效果不佳。

Method: 提出SATMC框架，通过图结构和属性转换顺序对齐网络分布，引入私有域信息减少机制和经验Wasserstein距离来增强模型泛化能力。

Result: 在9对公开跨域数据集上的实验表明，SATMC在跨网络节点分类任务中优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: 理论证明SATMC能够实现比现有图域自适应方法更紧的跨网络节点分类误差界，实验验证了其有效性。

Abstract: Graph domain adaptation has gained significant attention in label-scarce
scenarios across different graph domains. Traditional approaches to graph
domain adaptation primarily focus on transforming node attributes over raw
graph structures and aligning the distributions of the transformed node
features across networks. However, these methods often struggle with the
underlying structural heterogeneity between distinct graph domains, which leads
to suboptimal distribution alignment. To address this limitation, we propose
Structure-Attribute Transformation with Markov Chain (SATMC), a novel framework
that sequentially aligns distributions across networks via both graph structure
and attribute transformations. To mitigate the negative influence of
domain-private information and further enhance the model's generalization,
SATMC introduces a private domain information reduction mechanism and an
empirical Wasserstein distance. Theoretical proofs suggest that SATMC can
achieve a tighter error bound for cross-network node classification compared to
existing graph domain adaptation methods. Extensive experiments on nine pairs
of publicly available cross-domain datasets show that SATMC outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in the cross-network node classification task. The

TL;DR: ScaleDiff是一个用于大规模生成高难度数学问题的简单有效pipeline，通过自适应思维模型识别现有数据集中的难题，然后训练专门的难题生成器，避免了复杂提示和高API成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在扩展数学问题生成方面面临高计算成本、复杂提示和生成问题难度有限的挑战，需要一种更高效的方式来大规模创建难题。

Method: 使用自适应思维模型单次前向传播识别现有数据集中的难题，然后训练专门的DiffGen-8B难题生成器，无需复杂提示即可大规模生成新难题。

Result: 在ScaleDiff-Math数据集上微调Qwen2.5-Math-7B-Instruct，相比原始数据集性能提升11.3%，在多个数学竞赛基准上达到65.9%平均准确率，超越了OpenThinker3等强模型。

Conclusion: ScaleDiff证明了使用成本效益高的教师模型可以有效转移高级推理能力，并且随着难题数量增加，模型在困难基准上的性能呈现明显的扩展现象。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have shown impressive capabilities in complex
problem-solving, often benefiting from training on difficult mathematical
problems that stimulate intricate reasoning. Recent efforts have explored
automated synthesis of mathematical problems by prompting proprietary models or
large-scale open-source models from seed data or inherent mathematical
concepts. However, scaling up these methods remains challenging due to their
high computational/API cost, complexity of prompting, and limited difficulty
level of the generated problems. To overcome these limitations, we propose
ScaleDiff, a simple yet effective pipeline designed to scale the creation of
difficult problems. We efficiently identify difficult problems from existing
datasets with only a single forward pass using an adaptive thinking model,
which can perceive problem difficulty and automatically switch between
"Thinking" and "NoThinking" modes. We then train a specialized difficult
problem generator (DiffGen-8B) on this filtered difficult data, which can
produce new difficult problems in large scale, eliminating the need for
complex, per-instance prompting and its associated high API costs. Fine-tuning
Qwen2.5-Math-7B-Instruct on the ScaleDiff-Math dataset yields a substantial
performance increase of 11.3% compared to the original dataset and achieves a
65.9% average accuracy on AIME'24, AIME'25, HMMT-Feb'25, BRUMO'25, and MATH500,
outperforming recent strong LRMs like OpenThinker3. Notably, this performance
is achieved using the cost-efficient Qwen3-8B model as a teacher, demonstrating
that our pipeline can effectively transfer advanced reasoning capabilities
without relying on larger, more expensive teacher models. Furthermore, we
observe a clear scaling phenomenon in model performance on difficult benchmarks
as the quantity of difficult problems increases. Code:

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TyphoonMLA是一种结合naive和absorb两种核实现的混合方法，用于改进Multi-Head Latent Attention (MLA)机制在解码阶段的性能，通过利用共享前缀实现计算效率提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的MLA解码内核采用absorb方法以减少HBM带宽使用，但其计算受限的特性无法充分利用注意力计算中的数据复用机会（如共享前缀），限制了性能提升。

Method: 提出TyphoonMLA混合方法：对注意力计算中计算受限的部分使用naive公式以利用共享前缀，对非共享部分使用absorb公式以减少带宽需求。

Result: 在NPU和GPU上分别实现了最高3倍和3.24倍的注意力计算吞吐量提升，HBM大小仅增加3%的开销。

Conclusion: TyphoonMLA成功结合了两种核实现的优势，显著提升了MLA架构的解码性能，为大型语言模型的推理优化提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Multi-Head Latent Attention (MLA) is a recent attention mechanism adopted in
state-of-the-art LLMs such as DeepSeek-v3 and Kimi K2. Thanks to its novel
formulation, MLA allows two functionally equivalent but computationally
distinct kernel implementations: naive and absorb. While the naive kernels
(e.g., FlashAttention) are typically preferred in training and prefill for
their computational efficiency, existing decoding kernels (e.g., FlashMLA) rely
on the absorb method to minimize HBM bandwidth usage. However, the
compute-bound nature of the absorb implementations prohibits performance
benefits from data reuse opportunities in attention calculations, such as
shared prefixes. In this work, we introduce TyphoonMLA, a hybrid approach that
combines naive and absorb formulations to harness the strengths of both.
TyphoonMLA effectively leverages the shared prefix by applying the naive
formulation to the compute-bound parts of attention calculations, while
reducing the bandwidth requirements for non-shared parts by using the absorb
formulation. As a result, TyphoonMLA improves the throughput of attention
calculations in MLA architectures by up to 3x and 3.24x on NPU and GPUs, with
only a 3% overhead in HBM size.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决图学习中模型如何泛化到新图的核心挑战，现有方法局限于单图传导式设置，缺乏对归纳泛化的系统性评估。

Method: 开发GraphUniverse框架，生成具有持久语义社区的图家族，控制结构属性如同质性和度分布，实现对分布偏移的鲁棒性测试。

Result: 基准测试显示传导性能不能预测归纳泛化能力，鲁棒性对模型架构和初始图状态高度敏感。

Conclusion: GraphUniverse的灵活性和可扩展性有助于开发真正可泛化的架构，包括下一代图基础模型。

Abstract: A fundamental challenge in graph learning is understanding how models
generalize to new, unseen graphs. While synthetic benchmarks offer controlled
settings for analysis, existing approaches are confined to single-graph,
transductive settings where models train and test on the same graph structure.
Addressing this gap, we introduce GraphUniverse, a framework for generating
entire families of graphs to enable the first systematic evaluation of
inductive generalization at scale. Our core innovation is the generation of
graphs with persistent semantic communities, ensuring conceptual consistency
while allowing fine-grained control over structural properties like homophily
and degree distributions. This enables crucial but underexplored robustness
tests, such as performance under controlled distribution shifts. Benchmarking a
wide range of architectures -- from GNNs to graph transformers and topological
architectures -- reveals that strong transductive performance is a poor
predictor of inductive generalization. Furthermore, we find that robustness to
distribution shift is highly sensitive not only to model architecture choice
but also to the initial graph regime (e.g., high vs. low homophily). Beyond
benchmarking, GraphUniverse's flexibility and scalability can facilitate the
development of robust and truly generalizable architectures -- including
next-generation graph foundation models. An interactive demo is available at
https://graphuniverse.streamlit.app.

TL;DR: VARL是一个利用视觉语言模型为强化学习代理提供动作建议的框架，通过增加样本多样性来提高样本效率，特别是在稀疏奖励任务中。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在线强化学习在复杂任务中耗时较长，需要大量交互步骤来学习最优Q函数。现有的视觉语言动作策略在低层控制方面性能有限，且通常需要任务特定的专家演示进行微调。

Method: VARL框架利用视觉语言模型的领域知识为强化学习代理提供动作建议，而不是设计启发式奖励，从而保证最优性和收敛性不变。建议的动作增加了样本多样性。

Result: 在不同环境和代理设置下的评估结果显示，VARL显著提高了样本效率，且没有引入显著的计算开销。

Conclusion: VARL是一个通用的在线强化学习框架，使得在现实世界环境中直接从零开始应用强化学习变得可行。

Abstract: Online reinforcement learning in complex tasks is time-consuming, as massive
interaction steps are needed to learn the optimal Q-function.Vision-language
action (VLA) policies represent a promising direction for solving diverse
tasks; however, their performance on low-level control remains limited, and
effective deployment often requires task-specific expert demonstrations for
fine-tuning. In this paper, we propose \textbf{VARL} (\textbf{V}LM as
\textbf{A}ction advisor for online \textbf{R}einforcement \textbf{L}earning), a
framework that leverages the domain knowledge of vision-language models (VLMs)
to provide action suggestions for reinforcement learning agents. Unlike
previous methods, VARL provides action suggestions rather than designing
heuristic rewards, thereby guaranteeing unchanged optimality and convergence.
The suggested actions increase sample diversity and ultimately improve sample
efficiency, especially in sparse-reward tasks. To validate the effectiveness of
VARL, we evaluate it across diverse environments and agent settings. Results
show that VARL greatly improves sample efficiency without introducing
significant computational overhead. These advantages make VARL a general
framework for online reinforcement learning and make it feasible to directly
apply reinforcement learning from scratch in real-world environments.

TL;DR: EvoMail是一个自进化的认知代理框架，通过构建统一异构邮件图、认知图神经网络和对抗性自进化循环，实现强大的垃圾邮件和钓鱼邮件检测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代垃圾邮件和钓鱼攻击已超越传统关键词黑名单或简单启发式方法，攻击者使用多模态策略结合文本、URL、伪造头部和恶意附件，传统检测系统难以整合异构信号和持续适应。

Method: 构建统一异构邮件图融合文本内容、元数据和嵌入资源；使用LLM增强的认知图神经网络进行上下文感知推理；采用红队-蓝队对抗性自进化循环，红队生成新规避策略，蓝队从失败中学习并压缩经验到记忆模块。

Result: 在真实数据集和合成对抗变体上的实验表明，EvoMail在检测准确性、对演化垃圾邮件策略的适应性和推理可解释性方面持续优于最先进基线方法。

Conclusion: EvoMail作为对抗下一代垃圾邮件和钓鱼威胁的弹性和可解释防御框架具有巨大潜力。

Abstract: Modern email spam and phishing attacks have evolved far beyond keyword
blacklists or simple heuristics. Adversaries now craft multi-modal campaigns
that combine natural-language text with obfuscated URLs, forged headers, and
malicious attachments, adapting their strategies within days to bypass filters.
Traditional spam detection systems, which rely on static rules or
single-modality models, struggle to integrate heterogeneous signals or to
continuously adapt, leading to rapid performance degradation.
  We propose EvoMail, a self-evolving cognitive agent framework for robust
detection of spam and phishing. EvoMail first constructs a unified
heterogeneous email graph that fuses textual content, metadata (headers,
senders, domains), and embedded resources (URLs, attachments). A Cognitive
Graph Neural Network enhanced by a Large Language Model (LLM) performs
context-aware reasoning across these sources to identify coordinated spam
campaigns. Most critically, EvoMail engages in an adversarial self-evolution
loop: a ''red-team'' agent generates novel evasion tactics -- such as character
obfuscation or AI-generated phishing text -- while the ''blue-team'' detector
learns from failures, compresses experiences into a memory module, and reuses
them for future reasoning.
  Extensive experiments on real-world datasets (Enron-Spam, Ling-Spam,
SpamAssassin, and TREC) and synthetic adversarial variants demonstrate that
EvoMail consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in detection
accuracy, adaptability to evolving spam tactics, and interpretability of
reasoning traces. These results highlight EvoMail's potential as a resilient
and explainable defense framework against next-generation spam and phishing
threats.

Motivation: 深度神经网络在图像分类任务中表现出色但容易受到精心设计的对抗性扰动攻击。本文重新审视线性降维作为一种简单、数据自适应的防御方法。

Method: 使用稀疏主成分分析(SPCA)作为前端特征提取器，与标准PCA进行对比。理论分析包括为SPCA特征上的线性头推导精确的鲁棒性证书，并通过Lipschitz组合论证证明稀疏性降低算子范数边界。

Result: 实验表明，在强白盒和黑盒攻击下，SPCA比PCA表现更稳健，同时保持竞争力的干净准确率。稀疏投影减少了对抗性杠杆效应。

Conclusion: 理论分析确定了稀疏投影减少对抗性杠杆的机制，实验验证了这种优势在线性设置之外仍然存在，SPCA是一种有效的对抗性防御方法。

Abstract: Deep neural networks perform remarkably well on image classification tasks
but remain vulnerable to carefully crafted adversarial perturbations. This work
revisits linear dimensionality reduction as a simple, data-adapted defense. We
empirically compare standard Principal Component Analysis (PCA) with its sparse
variant (SPCA) as front-end feature extractors for downstream classifiers, and
we complement these experiments with a theoretical analysis. On the theory
side, we derive exact robustness certificates for linear heads applied to SPCA
features: for both $\ell_\infty$ and $\ell_2$ threat models (binary and
multiclass), the certified radius grows as the dual norms of $W^\top u$ shrink,
where $W$ is the projection and $u$ the head weights. We further show that for
general (non-linear) heads, sparsity reduces operator-norm bounds through a
Lipschitz composition argument, predicting lower input sensitivity.
Empirically, with a small non-linear network after the projection, SPCA
consistently degrades more gracefully than PCA under strong white-box and
black-box attacks while maintaining competitive clean accuracy. Taken together,
the theory identifies the mechanism (sparser projections reduce adversarial
leverage) and the experiments verify that this benefit persists beyond the
linear setting. Our code is available at

TL;DR: LAVA是一种后处理、模型无关的方法，用于解释无监督黑盒模型的局部嵌入结构，通过分析输入特征与潜在空间组织的关系来揭示可解释的模式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 无监督黑盒模型虽然能驱动科学发现，但难以解释。现有的解释方法要么过于细粒度（单样本解释），要么过于简化（数据集级总结），缺乏基于潜在空间邻近性的自动化策略来关联相似样本。

Method: LAVA将潜在空间表示为一系列局部邻域，通过原始特征之间的相关性来描述这些邻域，然后揭示整个潜在空间中重复出现的相关性模式。该方法基于UMAP嵌入，在MNIST和单细胞肾脏数据集上进行验证。

Result: LAVA能够捕捉相关的特征关联，在潜在空间中看似遥远的区域之间发现视觉和生物学上相关的局部模式。

Conclusion: LAVA提供了一种有效的方法来解释无监督学习中的局部嵌入组织，有助于从复杂模型中提取有意义的科学见解。

Abstract: Unsupervised black-box models can be drivers of scientific discovery, but
remain difficult to interpret. Crucially, discovery hinges on understanding the
model output, which is often a multi-dimensional latent embedding rather than a
well-defined target. While explainability for supervised learning usually seeks
to uncover how input features are used to predict a target, its unsupervised
counterpart should relate input features to the structure of the learned latent
space. Adaptations of supervised model explainability for unsupervised learning
provide either single-sample or dataset-wide summary explanations. However,
without automated strategies of relating similar samples to one another guided
by their latent proximity, explanations remain either too fine-grained or too
reductive to be meaningful. This is especially relevant for manifold learning
methods that produce no mapping function, leaving us only with the relative
spatial organization of their embeddings. We introduce Locality-Aware Variable
Associations (LAVA), a post-hoc model-agnostic method designed to explain local
embedding organization through its relationship with the input features. To
achieve this, LAVA represents the latent space as a series of localities
(neighborhoods) described in terms of correlations between the original
features, and then reveals reoccurring patterns of correlations across the
entire latent space. Based on UMAP embeddings of MNIST and a single-cell kidney
dataset, we show that LAVA captures relevant feature associations, with
visually and biologically relevant local patterns shared among seemingly
distant regions of the latent spaces.

<details>

Motivation: 传统的LLM分词器将CAD序列分解为自然语言词片段，无法捕捉CAD的原始级语义和几何结构，限制了文本引导CAD原型设计的发展。

Method: 提出CAD-Tokenizer框架，使用基于序列的VQ-VAE，结合原始级池化和约束解码策略，生成紧凑且原始感知的CAD数据表示。

Result: 在统一的文本引导CAD原型设计中，CAD-Tokenizer显著提高了指令遵循能力和生成质量，在定量和定性评估上都优于通用LLM和任务特定基线。

Conclusion: 多模态分词策略与CAD的原始和结构特性对齐，能够为CAD数据处理提供更有效的表示方法，推动文本引导CAD原型设计的发展。

Abstract: Computer-Aided Design (CAD) is a foundational component of industrial
prototyping, where models are defined not by raw coordinates but by
construction sequences such as sketches and extrusions. This sequential
structure enables both efficient prototype initialization and subsequent
editing. Text-guided CAD prototyping, which unifies Text-to-CAD generation and
CAD editing, has the potential to streamline the entire design pipeline.
However, prior work has not explored this setting, largely because standard
large language model (LLM) tokenizers decompose CAD sequences into
natural-language word pieces, failing to capture primitive-level CAD semantics
and hindering attention modules from modeling geometric structure. We
conjecture that a multimodal tokenization strategy, aligned with CAD's
primitive and structural nature, can provide more effective representations. To
this end, we propose CAD-Tokenizer, a framework that represents CAD data with
modality-specific tokens using a sequence-based VQ-VAE with primitive-level
pooling and constrained decoding. This design produces compact, primitive-aware
representations that align with CAD's structural nature. Applied to unified
text-guided CAD prototyping, CAD-Tokenizer significantly improves instruction
following and generation quality, achieving better quantitative and qualitative
performance over both general-purpose LLMs and task-specific baselines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究GRPO算法中隐含的过程奖励模型特性，并解决原算法中过程步骤分布不均匀导致的探索和利用问题。

Method: 首先理论证明GRPO会诱导过程奖励模型，然后提出λ-GRPO改进算法来缓解过程步骤分布不均匀的问题。

Result: λ-GRPO训练的LLM在验证准确率和下游推理任务上表现优于标准GRPO，且达到峰值性能更快。

Conclusion: 研究表明可以利用GRPO算法中内置的隐藏过程奖励模型结构来提升性能，而无需使用成本高昂的显式定义的过程奖励模型。

Abstract: We prove theoretically that the GRPO RL algorithm induces a non-trivial
process reward model (PRM), under certain assumptions regarding within-group
overlap of token sequences across completions. We then show empirically that
these assumptions are met under real-world conditions: GRPO does in fact induce
a non-trivial PRM. Leveraging the framework of GRPO-as-a-PRM, we identify a
flaw in the GRPO objective: non-uniformly distributed process steps hinder both
exploration and exploitation (under different conditions). We propose a simple
modification to the algorithm to mitigate this defect ($\lambda$-GRPO), and
show that LLMs trained with $\lambda$-GRPO achieve higher validation accuracy
and performance on downstream reasoning tasks$-$and reach peak performance more
rapidly$-$than LLMs trained with standard GRPO. Our results call into question
the advantage of costly, explicitly-defined PRMs for GRPO: we show that it is
possible to instead leverage the hidden, built-in PRM structure within the
vanilla GRPO algorithm to boost model performance with a negligible impact on
training time and cost.

Result: 在标准基准和真实世界不平衡生物医学数据集上的广泛实验表明，相比最先进方法，DATS在降低跨任务校准误差方面表现稳定、可靠且一致。

Conclusion: DATS方法通过距离感知的温度缩放有效解决了持续学习中的校准问题，为安全关键应用提供了更可靠的模型不确定性评估。

Abstract: Continual Learning (CL) is recently gaining increasing attention for its
ability to enable a single model to learn incrementally from a sequence of new
classes. In this scenario, it is important to keep consistent predictive
performance across all the classes and prevent the so-called Catastrophic
Forgetting (CF). However, in safety-critical applications, predictive
performance alone is insufficient. Predictive models should also be able to
reliably communicate their uncertainty in a calibrated manner - that is, with
confidence scores aligned to the true frequencies of target events. Existing
approaches in CL address calibration primarily from a data-centric perspective,
relying on a single temperature shared across all tasks. Such solutions
overlook task-specific differences, leading to large fluctuations in
calibration error across tasks. For this reason, we argue that a more
principled approach should adapt the temperature according to the distance to
the current task. However, the unavailability of the task information at test
time/during deployment poses a major challenge to achieve the intended
objective. For this, we propose Distance-Aware Temperature Scaling (DATS),
which combines prototype-based distance estimation with distance-aware
calibration to infer task proximity and assign adaptive temperatures without
prior task information. Through extensive empirical evaluation on both standard
benchmarks and real-world, imbalanced datasets taken from the biomedical
domain, our approach demonstrates to be stable, reliable and consistent in
reducing calibration error across tasks compared to state-of-the-art
approaches.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MoT是一种在异构专家模型之间进行潜在层协作的新方法，通过轻量级路由器选择专家并在共享潜在空间中进行交叉注意力，实现单次推理的多模型协作。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多LLM方法要么将查询路由到一个或少数专家并独立生成，要么通过昂贵的多轮交换聚合输出，或者需要架构同质性进行权重融合。需要一种简单的方法来实现异构专家模型的潜在层协作。

Method: 为每个查询，轻量级路由器选择top-K专家并指定主专家；统一放置的交互层将隐藏状态投影到共享潜在空间，主专家对其活跃同伴进行交叉注意力。预训练专家保持冻结，仅训练路由器和轻量级交互层。

Result: 在5个分布内和3个分布外基准测试中，MoT超越了当前最先进的路由和聚合方法Avengers，分别提升+0.38%和+2.92%，且显著优于最佳单模型性能。

Conclusion: MoT提供了一种简单的潜在空间机制来组合异构LLM，是实现更广泛多LLM协作的实用步骤，具有单次推理、运行时与路由基线相当且无迭代聚合开销的优势。

Abstract: Open-source Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly specialize by domain
(e.g., math, code, general reasoning), motivating systems that leverage
complementary strengths across models. Prior multi-LLM approaches either (i)
route a query to one or a few experts and generate independently, (ii)
aggregate outputs from each model via costly multi-turn exchanges, or (iii)
fuse weights into a single model-typically requiring architectural homogeneity.
We introduce Mixture of Thoughts (MoT), a simple method for latent-level
collaboration among heterogeneous experts under a global routing scheme. For
each query, a lightweight router selects top-$K$ experts and designates a
primary expert; uniformly placed interaction layers project hidden states into
a shared latent space where the primary expert performs cross-attention over
its active (selected) peers. Pre-trained experts remain frozen; only the router
and the lightweight interaction layers are trained with a novel joint training
objective that improves both the expert selection and inter-expert
collaboration. Across five in-distribution (ID) and three out-of-distribution
(OOD) benchmarks, MoT surpasses the current routing and aggregation-based
state-of-the-art, Avengers, by $+0.38\%$ and $+2.92\%$, respectively. Further,
MoT significantly outperforms the best-performing single model. It achieves
this with single-pass inference, runtime comparable to routing baselines, and
none of the overheads of iterative aggregation. MoT offers a simple
latent-space mechanism for combining heterogeneous LLMs, a practical step
toward broader multi-LLM collaboration. Our code is publicly available at

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个基于f-散度的统一框架，用于扩散模型的机器遗忘，相比传统的MSE方法具有更好的灵活性和性能平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的文本到图像模型遗忘方法主要依赖均方误差（MSE），但这种方法只是f-散度的一个特例，缺乏灵活性。

Method: 构建基于f-散度的统一框架，允许使用任何f-散度进行遗忘，分析不同散度对算法收敛性和遗忘质量的影响。

Result: 提出的统一框架能够根据具体应用选择最优散度，在激进遗忘和概念保留之间实现更好的平衡。

Conclusion: f-散度框架为扩散模型遗忘提供了更灵活和有效的方法，超越了传统MSE方法的局限性。

Abstract: Machine unlearning aims to remove specific knowledge from a trained model.
While diffusion models (DMs) have shown remarkable generative capabilities,
existing unlearning methods for text-to-image (T2I) models often rely on
minimizing the mean squared error (MSE) between the output distribution of a
target and an anchor concept. We show that this MSE-based approach is a special
case of a unified $f$-divergence-based framework, in which any $f$-divergence
can be utilized. We analyze the benefits of using different $f$-divergences,
that mainly impact the convergence properties of the algorithm and the quality
of unlearning. The proposed unified framework offers a flexible paradigm that
allows to select the optimal divergence for a specific application, balancing
different trade-offs between aggressive unlearning and concept preservation.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的逆强化学习方法，将IRL简化为两个现成的监督学习问题：概率分类估计行为策略，以及迭代回归求解固定点方程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的最大熵IRL方法涉及复杂的内循环优化、重复动态规划或对抗训练，限制了现代高度表达性函数逼近器（如神经网络）的使用。

Method: 通过发现群体最大似然解可由涉及行为策略的线性固定点方程表征，将IRL分解为概率分类和迭代回归两个监督学习任务。

Result: 该方法简单模块化，适用于不同函数逼近类别和算法，实验结果显示其性能与MaxEnt IRL相当或更优。

Conclusion: 这种新方法简化了IRL的实现，使其更容易与现代函数逼近器结合使用，为模仿学习和经济学中的动态选择分析提供了更实用的工具。

Abstract: Inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) aims to explain observed behavior by
uncovering an underlying reward. In the maximum-entropy or
Gumbel-shocks-to-reward frameworks, this amounts to fitting a reward function
and a soft value function that together satisfy the soft Bellman consistency
condition and maximize the likelihood of observed actions. While this
perspective has had enormous impact in imitation learning for robotics and
understanding dynamic choices in economics, practical learning algorithms often
involve delicate inner-loop optimization, repeated dynamic programming, or
adversarial training, all of which complicate the use of modern, highly
expressive function approximators like neural nets and boosting. We revisit
softmax IRL and show that the population maximum-likelihood solution is
characterized by a linear fixed-point equation involving the behavior policy.
This observation reduces IRL to two off-the-shelf supervised learning problems:
probabilistic classification to estimate the behavior policy, and iterative
regression to solve the fixed point. The resulting method is simple and modular
across function approximation classes and algorithms. We provide a precise
characterization of the optimal solution, a generic oracle-based algorithm,
finite-sample error bounds, and empirical results showing competitive or
superior performance to MaxEnt IRL.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文研究了过参数化线性回归中最小ℓp插值器(p∈(1,2])的参数范数族随样本量的缩放规律，并通过双射线分析揭示了信号尖峰与零坐标之间的竞争关系，为DLNs提供了预测性桥梁。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决过参数化线性回归中ℓp偏置插值下所有ℓr范数(r∈[1,p])缩放规律这一基本但未解决的问题，为理解泛化代理指标提供理论依据。

Method: 采用简单的双射线分析，研究X⊤Y中信号尖峰与零坐标的竞争关系，并通过DLN可分离势将初始化尺度α校准为有效peff(α)。

Result: 发现了数据依赖的转折点n⋆和通用阈值r⋆=2(p-1)，该阈值区分了饱和的范数和持续增长的范数，DLNs实验验证了相同的肘部/阈值规律。

Conclusion: 建立了显式偏置和隐式偏置之间的预测桥梁，表明泛化代理指标的预测能力对所使用的ℓr范数敏感。

Abstract: For overparameterized linear regression with isotropic Gaussian design and
minimum-$\ell_p$ interpolator $p\in(1,2]$, we give a unified, high-probability
characterization for the scaling of the family of parameter norms $ \\{ \lVert
\widehat{w_p} \rVert_r \\}_{r \in [1,p]} $ with sample size.
  We solve this basic, but unresolved question through a simple dual-ray
analysis, which reveals a competition between a signal *spike* and a *bulk* of
null coordinates in $X^\top Y$, yielding closed-form predictions for (i) a
data-dependent transition $n_\star$ (the "elbow"), and (ii) a universal
threshold $r_\star=2(p-1)$ that separates $\lVert \widehat{w_p} \rVert_r$'s
which plateau from those that continue to grow with an explicit exponent.
  This unified solution resolves the scaling of *all* $\ell_r$ norms within the
family $r\in [1,p]$ under $\ell_p$-biased interpolation, and explains in one
picture which norms saturate and which increase as $n$ grows.
  We then study diagonal linear networks (DLNs) trained by gradient descent. By
calibrating the initialization scale $\alpha$ to an effective
$p_{\mathrm{eff}}(\alpha)$ via the DLN separable potential, we show empirically
that DLNs inherit the same elbow/threshold laws, providing a predictive bridge
between explicit and implicit bias.
  Given that many generalization proxies depend on $\lVert \widehat {w_p}
\rVert_r$, our results suggest that their predictive power will depend
sensitively on which $l_r$ norm is used.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TimeRCD是一个基于相对上下文差异预训练范式的时序异常检测基础模型，通过检测相邻时间窗口的差异而非重构输入来识别异常，在零样本场景下显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有基于重构的时序异常检测基础模型存在的目标不匹配问题：难以识别细微异常且易将复杂正常模式误判为异常，导致高假阴性和假阳性率。

Method: 提出相对上下文差异预训练范式，使用标准Transformer架构检测相邻时间窗口的显著差异来识别异常，并构建大规模合成语料库进行预训练。

Result: 在多个数据集上的广泛实验表明，TimeRCD在零样本时序异常检测中显著优于现有的通用和异常专用基础模型。

Conclusion: RCD范式为构建稳健且可泛化的时序异常检测基础模型提供了新的有效路径。

Abstract: Time series anomaly detection (TSAD) is a critical task, but developing
models that generalize to unseen data in a zero-shot manner remains a major
challenge. Prevailing foundation models for TSAD predominantly rely on
reconstruction-based objectives, which suffer from a fundamental objective
mismatch: they struggle to identify subtle anomalies while often
misinterpreting complex normal patterns, leading to high rates of false
negatives and positives. To overcome these limitations, we introduce
\texttt{TimeRCD}, a novel foundation model for TSAD built upon a new
pre-training paradigm: Relative Context Discrepancy (RCD). Instead of learning
to reconstruct inputs, \texttt{TimeRCD} is explicitly trained to identify
anomalies by detecting significant discrepancies between adjacent time windows.
This relational approach, implemented with a standard Transformer architecture,
enables the model to capture contextual shifts indicative of anomalies that
reconstruction-based methods often miss. To facilitate this paradigm, we
develop a large-scale, diverse synthetic corpus with token-level anomaly
labels, providing the rich supervisory signal necessary for effective
pre-training. Extensive experiments demonstrate that \texttt{TimeRCD}
significantly outperforms existing general-purpose and anomaly-specific
foundation models in zero-shot TSAD across diverse datasets. Our results
validate the superiority of the RCD paradigm and establish a new, effective
path toward building robust and generalizable foundation models for time series
anomaly detection.

Abstract: Accurately forecasting the long-term evolution of turbulence represents a
grand challenge in scientific computing and is crucial for applications ranging
from climate modeling to aerospace engineering. Existing deep learning methods,
particularly neural operators, often fail in long-term autoregressive
predictions, suffering from catastrophic error accumulation and a loss of
physical fidelity. This failure stems from their inability to simultaneously
capture the distinct mathematical structures that govern turbulent dynamics:
local, dissipative effects and global, non-local interactions. In this paper,
we propose the
{\textbf{\underline{D}}}ifferential-{\textbf{\underline{I}}}ntegral
{\textbf{\underline{N}}}eural {\textbf{\underline{O}}}perator (\method{}), a
novel framework designed from a first-principles approach of operator
decomposition. \method{} explicitly models the turbulent evolution through
parallel branches that learn distinct physical operators: a local differential
operator, realized by a constrained convolutional network that provably
converges to a derivative, and a global integral operator, captured by a
Transformer architecture that learns a data-driven global kernel. This
physics-based decomposition endows \method{} with exceptional stability and
robustness. Through extensive experiments on the challenging 2D Kolmogorov flow
benchmark, we demonstrate that \method{} significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art models in long-term forecasting. It successfully suppresses
error accumulation over hundreds of timesteps, maintains high fidelity in both
the vorticity fields and energy spectra, and establishes a new benchmark for
physically consistent, long-range turbulence forecast.

Abstract: Prognostics and Health Management ensures the reliability, safety, and
efficiency of complex engineered systems by enabling fault detection,
anticipating equipment failures, and optimizing maintenance activities
throughout an asset lifecycle. However, real-world PHM presents persistent
challenges: sensor data is often noisy or incomplete, available labels are
limited, and degradation behaviors and system interdependencies can be highly
complex and nonlinear. Physics-informed machine learning has emerged as a
promising approach to address these limitations by embedding physical knowledge
into data-driven models. This review examines how incorporating learning and
observational biases through physics-informed modeling and data strategies can
guide models toward physically consistent and reliable predictions. Learning
biases embed physical constraints into model training through physics-informed
loss functions and governing equations, or by incorporating properties like
monotonicity. Observational biases influence data selection and synthesis to
ensure models capture realistic system behavior through virtual sensing for
estimating unmeasured states, physics-based simulation for data augmentation,
and multi-sensor fusion strategies. The review then examines how these
approaches enable the transition from passive prediction to active
decision-making through reinforcement learning, which allows agents to learn
maintenance policies that respect physical constraints while optimizing
operational objectives. This closes the loop between model-based predictions,
simulation, and actual system operation, empowering adaptive decision-making.
Finally, the review addresses the critical challenge of scaling PHM solutions
from individual assets to fleet-wide deployment. Fast adaptation methods
including meta-learning and few-shot learning are reviewed alongside domain
generalization techniques ...

Abstract: Recent advances in reinforcement learning (RL) have significantly enhanced
the agentic capabilities of large language models (LLMs). In long-term and
multi-turn agent tasks, existing approaches driven solely by outcome rewards
often suffer from the problem of sparse supervision. To address the challenge,
we propose Tree-based Group Relative Policy Optimization (Tree-GRPO), a grouped
agent RL method based on tree search, where each tree node represents the
complete agent interaction step. By sharing common prefixes, the tree search
sampling increases the number of rollouts achievable within a fixed budget of
tokens or tool calls. Moreover, we find that the tree-structured trajectory
naturally allows the construction of step-wise process supervised signals even
using only the outcome reward. Based on this, Tree-GRPO estimates the grouped
relative advantages both on intra-tree and inter-tree levels. Through
theoretical analysis, we demonstrate that the objective of intra-tree level
group relative policy optimization is equivalent to that of step-level direct
preference learning. Experiments across 11 datasets and 3 types of QA tasks
demonstrate the superiority of the proposed tree-based RL over the chain-based
RL method.

Conclusion: 该工作为微调LLM的内部机制提供了新见解，并强调反事实图作为可解释AI的潜在工具。

Abstract: The widespread adoption of Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has enabled large
language models (LLMs) to acquire domain-specific knowledge with remarkable
efficiency. However, understanding how such a fine-tuning mechanism alters a
model's structural reasoning and semantic behavior remains an open challenge.
This work introduces a novel framework that explains fine-tuned LLMs via
counterfactuals grounded in knowledge graphs. Specifically, we construct
BioToolKG, a domain-specific heterogeneous knowledge graph in bioinformatics
tools and design a counterfactual-based fine-tuned LLMs explainer
(CFFTLLMExplainer) that learns soft masks over graph nodes and edges to
generate minimal structural perturbations that induce maximum semantic
divergence. Our method jointly optimizes structural sparsity and semantic
divergence while enforcing interpretability preserving constraints such as
entropy regularization and edge smoothness. We apply this framework to a
fine-tuned LLaMA-based LLM and reveal that counterfactual masking exposes the
model's structural dependencies and aligns with LoRA-induced parameter shifts.
This work provides new insights into the internal mechanisms of fine-tuned LLMs
and highlights counterfactual graphs as a potential tool for interpretable AI.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前数据分散在设备和机构中，隐私、所有权和法规限制阻止了数据集中化，因此需要在不进行中央聚合的情况下直接从分布式数据本地训练生成模型。

Method: 提出了三种方法：FFM-vanilla（客户端使用独立源和目标耦合进行本地训练）、FFM-LOT（使用局部最优传输耦合改善流直线性）和FFM-GOT（基于最优传输半对偶公式的联邦策略，通过共享全局势函数协调客户端耦合）。

Conclusion: FFM框架成功实现了隐私保护的分布式训练，在保持数据隐私的同时达到了与集中式训练相当的性能表现。

Abstract: Data today is decentralized, generated and stored across devices and
institutions where privacy, ownership, and regulation prevent centralization.
This motivates the need to train generative models directly from distributed
data locally without central aggregation. In this paper, we introduce Federated
Flow Matching (FFM), a framework for training flow matching models under
privacy constraints. Specifically, we first examine FFM-vanilla, where each
client trains locally with independent source and target couplings, preserving
privacy but yielding curved flows that slow inference. We then develop FFM-LOT,
which employs local optimal transport couplings to improve straightness within
each client but lacks global consistency under heterogeneous data. Finally, we
propose FFM-GOT, a federated strategy based on the semi-dual formulation of
optimal transport, where a shared global potential function coordinates
couplings across clients. Experiments on synthetic and image datasets show that
FFM enables privacy-preserving training while enhancing both the flow
straightness and sample quality in federated settings, with performance
comparable to the centralized baseline.

Abstract: Air pollution, a pressing global problem, threatens public health,
environmental sustainability, and climate stability. Achieving accurate and
scalable forecasting across spatially distributed monitoring stations is
challenging due to intricate multi-pollutant interactions, evolving
meteorological conditions, and region specific spatial heterogeneity. To
address this challenge, we propose AirPCM, a novel deep spatiotemporal
forecasting model that integrates multi-region, multi-pollutant dynamics with
explicit meteorology-pollutant causality modeling. Unlike existing methods
limited to single pollutants or localized regions, AirPCM employs a unified
architecture to jointly capture cross-station spatial correlations, temporal
auto-correlations, and meteorology-pollutant dynamic causality. This empowers
fine-grained, interpretable multi-pollutant forecasting across varying
geographic and temporal scales, including sudden pollution episodes. Extensive
evaluations on multi-scale real-world datasets demonstrate that AirPCM
consistently surpasses state-of-the-art baselines in both predictive accuracy

### [110] [It's Not You, It's Clipping: A Soft Trust-Region via Probability Smoothing for LLM RL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21282)
*Madeleine Dwyer,Adam Sobey,Adriane Chapman*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了概率平滑策略优化（PSPO）方法，通过平滑当前策略概率来替代传统的比率裁剪，在保持梯度信号的同时创建软信任区域，从而稳定大语言模型的强化学习训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RL方法如PPO和GRPO依赖比率裁剪来稳定更新，但裁剪会丢弃信息并引入梯度不连续性。需要一种既能防止不稳定更新又能保留更多信息的方法。

Method: PSPO方法在计算重要性比率之前，将当前策略的概率向旧策略平滑，类似于标签平滑。这种方法创建了软信任区域，避免大的破坏性更新，同时保持梯度信号。

Result: 在Qwen2.5-0.5B和Qwen2.5-1.5B模型上的实验显示，相比裁剪GRPO，GR-PSPO在GSM8K上的性能提升超过20%（0.5B模型：39.7% vs 17.6%；1.5B模型：59.4% vs 37.8%），并且产生更清晰、简洁和逻辑性更强的回答。

Conclusion: PSPO提供了一种有效的替代比率裁剪的方法，既能稳定训练过程，又能显著提升模型性能，特别是在数学推理任务上表现出色。

Abstract: Training large language models (LLMs) with reinforcement learning (RL)
methods such as PPO and GRPO commonly relies on ratio clipping to stabilise
updates. While effective at preventing instability, clipping discards
information and introduces gradient discontinuities. We propose Probability
Smoothing Policy Optimisation (PSPO), which smooths the current policy's
probabilities toward the old (behaviour) policy before computing the importance
ratio, analogous to label smoothing. Unlike clipping, PSPO preserves gradient
signal, while interpolation toward the old policy creates a soft trust region
that discourages large, destabilising updates, with formal guarantees.
  We instantiate PSPO within GRPO (GR-PSPO) and fine-tune Qwen2.5-0.5B and
Qwen2.5-1.5B on GSM8K, evaluating on GSM8K test and the cross-dataset
generalisation on SVAMP, ASDiv, and MATH-500. Relative to unclipped GRPO
(single iteration; no data reuse, ratio always = 1), GR-PSPO achieves similar
performance but improves the reasoning leading to clearer and more concise
responses which are more logical. Compared to clipped GRPO, GR-PSPO
substantially improves performance both the 0.5B and 1.5B models, with a boost
of over 20% on GSM8K (39.7% vs. 17.6% for 0.5B, 59.4% vs. 37.8% for 1.5B).

*Phone Kyaw,Kshitij Kayastha,Shahin Jabbari*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的算法，用于在L^p范数约束下计算广义线性模型的最优鲁棒追索，相比现有方法显著降低了追索成本并提高了有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有鲁棒追索方法主要使用L^∞范数来衡量模型变化，但这可能导致追索解决方案成本过高。需要一种更实用的方法来处理更受约束的模型变化。

Method: 开发了一种新算法，在L^p范数（p≥1但p≠∞）约束下，为广义线性模型提供可证明的最优鲁棒追索计算。

Result: 实验表明，该算法在线性和非线性模型上都显著降低了追索成本（最多降低几个数量级），并在追索实施成本与有效性之间实现了更好的权衡。

Conclusion: 该方法相比现有工作提供了更稀疏的追索解决方案，并且对保证可行性的后处理方法具有弹性，是鲁棒追索领域的重要改进。

Abstract: Recourse provides individuals who received undesirable labels (e.g., denied a
loan) from algorithmic decision-making systems with a minimum-cost improvement
suggestion to achieve the desired outcome. However, in practice, models often
get updated to reflect changes in the data distribution or environment,
invalidating the recourse recommendations (i.e., following the recourse will
not lead to the desirable outcome). The robust recourse literature addresses
this issue by providing a framework for computing recourses whose validity is
resilient to slight changes in the model. However, since the optimization
problem of computing robust recourse is non-convex (even for linear models),
most of the current approaches do not have any theoretical guarantee on the
optimality of the recourse. Recent work by Kayastha et. al. provides the first
provably optimal algorithm for robust recourse with respect to generalized
linear models when the model changes are measured using the $L^{\infty}$ norm.
However, using the $L^{\infty}$ norm can lead to recourse solutions with a high
price. To address this shortcoming, we consider more constrained model changes
defined by the $L^p$ norm, where $p\geq 1$ but $p\neq \infty$, and provide a
new algorithm that provably computes the optimal robust recourse for
generalized linear models. Empirically, for both linear and non-linear models,
we demonstrate that our algorithm achieves a significantly lower price of
recourse (up to several orders of magnitude) compared to prior work and also
exhibits a better trade-off between the implementation cost of recourse and its
validity. Our empirical analysis also illustrates that our approach provides
more sparse recourses compared to prior work and remains resilient to
post-processing approaches that guarantee feasibility.

*Yehonatan Refael,Guy Smorodinsky,Ofir Lindenbaum,Itay Safran*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文分析了神经网络训练数据记忆化带来的隐私安全问题，通过理论证明和实证研究揭示了现有重建方法的固有局限性，并发现训练更充分的网络反而更不容易遭受重建攻击。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 神经网络对训练数据的记忆化引发了严重的隐私和安全担忧，虽然已有研究表明在某些条件下可以从模型参数重建部分训练数据，但这些攻击的可靠性缺乏坚实的理论基础。

Method: 采用理论分析和实证验证相结合的方法，首先严格证明了在没有先验知识的情况下存在无限多的替代解，然后通过实验证明精确复制训练样本只是偶然现象。

Result: 研究发现重建攻击在理论上不可靠，且训练更充分的网络（满足隐式偏差条件更强）实际上更不容易遭受重建攻击。

Conclusion: 该研究完善了训练数据泄露可能性的理论理解，为缓解重建攻击提供了新见解，并在这一背景下调和了隐私保护与强泛化需求之间的矛盾。

Abstract: The memorization of training data by neural networks raises pressing concerns
for privacy and security. Recent work has shown that, under certain conditions,
portions of the training set can be reconstructed directly from model
parameters. Some of these methods exploit implicit bias toward margin
maximization, suggesting that properties often regarded as beneficial for
generalization may actually compromise privacy. Yet despite striking empirical
demonstrations, the reliability of these attacks remains poorly understood and
lacks a solid theoretical foundation. In this work, we take a complementary
perspective: rather than designing stronger attacks, we analyze the inherent
weaknesses and limitations of existing reconstruction methods and identify
conditions under which they fail. We rigorously prove that, without
incorporating prior knowledge about the data, there exist infinitely many
alternative solutions that may lie arbitrarily far from the true training set,
rendering reconstruction fundamentally unreliable. Empirically, we further
demonstrate that exact duplication of training examples occurs only by chance.
Our results refine the theoretical understanding of when training set leakage
is possible and offer new insights into mitigating reconstruction attacks.
Remarkably, we demonstrate that networks trained more extensively, and
therefore satisfying implicit bias conditions more strongly -- are, in fact,
less susceptible to reconstruction attacks, reconciling privacy with the need
for strong generalization in this setting.

Conclusion: HPC容器社区在支持GenAI工作负载方面存在实际挑战和机遇，本文的经验为未来研究和工具开发提供了指导方向。

Abstract: Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) applications are built from
specialized components -- inference servers, object storage, vector and graph
databases, and user interfaces -- interconnected via web-based APIs. While
these components are often containerized and deployed in cloud environments,
such capabilities are still emerging at High-Performance Computing (HPC)
centers. In this paper, we share our experience deploying GenAI workloads
within an established HPC center, discussing the integration of HPC and cloud
computing environments. We describe our converged computing architecture that
integrates HPC and Kubernetes platforms running containerized GenAI workloads,
helping with reproducibility. A case study illustrates the deployment of the
Llama Large Language Model (LLM) using a containerized inference server (vLLM)
across both Kubernetes and HPC platforms using multiple container runtimes. Our
experience highlights practical considerations and opportunities for the HPC
container community, guiding future research and tool development.

*Skyler Ruiter,Jiannan Tian,Fengguang Song*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: FZModules是一个异构框架，用于通过高性能模块组装误差有界的自定义压缩流水线，支持快速实验和领域定制设计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代科学模拟和仪器生成的数据量超过内存和存储容量，限制了可扩展性。虽然损失压缩通过控制误差来减少数据占用和提高吞吐量，但最优流水线高度依赖于数据和目标，需要压缩专业知识。GPU压缩器提供高吞吐量，但通常采用硬编码的融合内核，阻碍快速实验，且在率失真性能上表现不佳。

Method: FZModules框架通过简洁可扩展的接口从高性能模块组装误差有界的自定义压缩流水线。利用异步任务支持的执行库推断数据依赖、管理内存移动，并暴露分支和阶段级并发，实现强大的异步压缩流水线。

Result: 在四个代表性科学数据集上评估三个使用FZModules构建的流水线，结果显示它们可以达到与融合内核GPU压缩器相当的端到端加速，同时实现与更高保真度的CPU或混合压缩器相似的率失真性能。

Conclusion: FZModules框架能够实现快速、领域定制的压缩流水线设计，在保持高吞吐量的同时提供良好的率失真性能。

Abstract: Modern scientific simulations and instruments generate data volumes that
overwhelm memory and storage, throttling scalability. Lossy compression
mitigates this by trading controlled error for reduced footprint and throughput
gains, yet optimal pipelines are highly data and objective specific, demanding
compression expertise. GPU compressors supply raw throughput but often
hard-code fused kernels that hinder rapid experimentation, and underperform in
rate-distortion. We present FZModules, a heterogeneous framework for assembling
error-bounded custom compression pipelines from high-performance modules
through a concise extensible interface. We further utilize an asynchronous
task-backed execution library that infers data dependencies, manages memory
movement, and exposes branch and stage level concurrency for powerful
asynchronous compression pipelines. Evaluating three pipelines built with
FZModules on four representative scientific datasets, we show they can compare
end-to-end speedup of fused-kernel GPU compressors while achieving similar
rate-distortion to higher fidelity CPU or hybrid compressors, enabling rapid,
domain-tailored design.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mojo作为首个基于LLVM MLIR编译器基础设施的语言，旨在通过结合Python的互操作性和类似CUDA的语法来弥补性能和生产力差距，实现编译时便携的GPU编程。

Method: 针对四种科学计算工作负载进行测试：七点模板（内存受限）、BabelStream（内存受限）、miniBUDE（计算受限）和Hartree-Fock（具有原子操作的计算受限），在NVIDIA H100和AMD MI300A GPU上与供应商基线进行比较。

Result: Mojo在内存受限内核上的性能与CUDA和HIP相当，但在AMD GPU上的原子操作以及AMD和NVIDIA GPU上的快速数学计算受限内核存在性能差距。

Conclusion: 尽管学习曲线和编程要求仍处于较低水平，但Mojo可以在科学计算和AI融合的碎片化Python生态系统中弥补显著差距。

Abstract: We explore the performance and portability of the novel Mojo language for
scientific computing workloads on GPUs. As the first language based on the
LLVM's Multi-Level Intermediate Representation (MLIR) compiler infrastructure,
Mojo aims to close performance and productivity gaps by combining Python's
interoperability and CUDA-like syntax for compile-time portable GPU
programming. We target four scientific workloads: a seven-point stencil
(memory-bound), BabelStream (memory-bound), miniBUDE (compute-bound), and
Hartree-Fock (compute-bound with atomic operations); and compare their
performance against vendor baselines on NVIDIA H100 and AMD MI300A GPUs. We
show that Mojo's performance is competitive with CUDA and HIP for memory-bound
kernels, whereas gaps exist on AMD GPUs for atomic operations and for fast-math
compute-bound kernels on both AMD and NVIDIA GPUs. Although the learning curve
and programming requirements are still fairly low-level, Mojo can close
significant gaps in the fragmented Python ecosystem in the convergence of
scientific computing and AI.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种针对RRAM阵列设计的分布式内存原始-对偶混合梯度方法，通过算法-硬件协同设计解决大规模优化问题，相比GPU加速求解器实现能耗和延迟降低三个数量级。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统架构受限于基本物理限制，无法满足计算工作负载的指数增长需求。内存计算虽能提供低延迟和低能耗的模拟计算，但现有算法无法直接应用于内存计算，特别是对于需要频繁矩阵重编程的约束优化问题。

Method: 开发分布式内存原始-对偶混合梯度方法，最小化昂贵的写入周期，包含对设备非理想性的鲁棒性，利用对称块矩阵公式统一分布式交叉开关的操作，并集成物理模拟框架MELISO+评估性能。

Result: 在大规模线性程序上基准测试显示，RRAM求解器达到可比精度，同时能耗和延迟降低三个数量级。

Conclusion: 这是首个在RRAM上实现的PDHG线性规划求解器，展示了算法-硬件协同设计通过分布式内存计算解决大规模优化问题的变革潜力。

Abstract: The exponential growth of computational workloads is surpassing the
capabilities of conventional architectures, which are constrained by
fundamental limits. In-memory computing (IMC) with RRAM provides a promising
alternative by providing analog computations with significant gains in latency
and energy use. However, existing algorithms developed for conventional
architectures do not translate to IMC, particularly for constrained
optimization problems where frequent matrix reprogramming remains
cost-prohibitive for IMC applications. Here we present a distributed in-memory
primal-dual hybrid gradient (PDHG) method, specifically co-designed for arrays
of RRAM devices. Our approach minimizes costly write cycles, incorporates
robustness against device non-idealities, and leverages a symmetric
block-matrix formulation to unify operations across distributed crossbars. We
integrate a physics-based simulation framework called MELISO+ to evaluate
performance under realistic device conditions. Benchmarking against
GPU-accelerated solvers on large-scale linear programs demonstrates that our
RRAM-based solver achieves comparable accuracy with up to three orders of
magnitude reductions in energy consumption and latency. These results
demonstrate the first PDHG-based LP solver implemented on RRAMs, showcasing the
transformative potential of algorithm-hardware co-design for solving
large-scale optimization through distributed in-memory computing.

Motivation: 现有分布式稀疏矩阵操作库如CombBLAS和PETSc在通信和计算效率方面存在不足，需要开发更高效的算法来提升大规模稀疏矩阵处理的性能

Method: 采用Identify-Exchange-Build三阶段策略：识别要发送的本地非零元素、交换所需数据、从接收元素构建本地子矩阵，结合无同步多线程算法优化本地计算

Result: 在多个集群上的实验表明，该算法在矩阵置换、子图提取、流图应用等场景下性能显著优于CombBLAS和PETSc

Conclusion: 该工作为稀疏矩阵置换、提取和赋值操作提供了完整的算法研究、软件实现和实验评估，为大规模稀疏矩阵处理提供了高效解决方案

Abstract: We present scalable distributed-memory algorithms for sparse matrix
permutation, extraction, and assignment. Our methods follow an
Identify-Exchange-Build (IEB) strategy where each process identifies the local
nonzeros to be sent, exchanges the required data, and then builds its local
submatrix from the received elements. This approach reduces communication
compared to SpGEMM-based methods in distributed memory. By employing
synchronization-free multithreaded algorithms, we further accelerate local
computations, achieving substantially better performance than existing
libraries such as CombBLAS and PETSc. We design efficient software for these
operations and evaluate their performance on two university clusters and the
Perlmutter supercomputer. Our experiments span a variety of application
scenarios, including matrix permutation for load balancing, matrix reordering,
subgraph extraction, and streaming graph applications. In all cases, we compare
our algorithms against CombBLAS, the most comprehensive distributed library for
these operations, and, in some scenarios, against PETSc. Overall, this work
provides a comprehensive study of algorithms, software implementations,
experimental evaluations, and applications for sparse matrix permutation,
extraction, and assignment.

Motivation: 科学工作流越来越多地涉及HPC和机器学习任务的结合，但传统的启动器如Slurm的srun在并发性和吞吐量方面存在限制，不适合动态和异构的工作负载。

Method: 将RADICAL-Pilot（RP）与Flux和Dragon两种运行时系统集成，实现分层资源管理和高吞吐量函数执行。在Frontier系统上使用合成和生产规模的工作负载进行性能测试。

Result: RP+Flux可持续达到930任务/秒，RP+Flux+Dragon超过1,500任务/秒，利用率超过99.6%。而srun峰值仅为152任务/秒，利用率低于50%。在IMPECCABLE.v2药物发现活动中，RP+Flux相比srun/Slurm将完成时间缩短30-60%，吞吐量提高四倍以上。

Conclusion: RP与运行时系统的混合集成为混合AI-HPC工作负载提供了一种可扩展的方法，显著优于传统调度器。

Abstract: Scientific workflows increasingly involve both HPC and machine-learning
tasks, combining MPI-based simulations, training, and inference in a single
execution. Launchers such as Slurm's srun constrain concurrency and throughput,
making them unsuitable for dynamic and heterogeneous workloads. We present a
performance study of RADICAL-Pilot (RP) integrated with Flux and Dragon, two
complementary runtime systems that enable hierarchical resource management and
high-throughput function execution. Using synthetic and production-scale
workloads on Frontier, we characterize the task execution properties of RP
across runtime configurations. RP+Flux sustains up to 930 tasks/s, and
RP+Flux+Dragon exceeds 1,500 tasks/s with over 99.6% utilization. In contrast,
srun peaks at 152 tasks/s and degrades with scale, with utilization below 50%.
For IMPECCABLE.v2 drug discovery campaign, RP+Flux reduces makespan by 30-60%
relative to srun/Slurm and increases throughput more than four times on up to
1,024. These results demonstrate hybrid runtime integration in RP as a scalable

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为tail batching的新型rollout调度策略，通过将长尾响应整合到少数长轮次中，有效减少GPU空闲时间，显著加速RL训练而不牺牲准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 同步RL后训练存在GPU利用率低的问题，主要是由于rollout步骤中响应长度不平衡导致的气泡现象。现有系统通过放松同步来缓解此问题，但会损害训练准确性。

Method: 引入tail batching策略，系统地将导致长尾响应的提示整合到少量rollout步骤（长轮次）中，确保大多数步骤（短轮次）仅涉及平衡的短rollout。同时开发了RollPacker系统，在rollout、reward和训练三个阶段进行全面优化。

Result: 实验结果表明，RollPacker在128个H800 GPU上对Qwen2.5系列LLMs实现了2.03x-2.56x的端到端训练时间减少，相比veRL和RLHFuse分别达到2.24x的加速比。

Conclusion: tail batching策略和RollPacker系统能够有效解决同步RL训练中的GPU利用率问题，在保持训练准确性的同时显著提升训练效率。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a pivotal post-training technique for
enhancing the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). However,
synchronous RL post-training often suffers from significant GPU
underutilization, referred to as bubbles, caused by imbalanced response lengths
within rollout steps. Many RL systems attempt to alleviate this problem by
relaxing synchronization, but this can compromise training accuracy. In this
paper, we introduce tail batching, a novel rollout scheduling strategy for
synchronous RL that systematically consolidates prompts leading to long-tail
responses into a small subset of rollout steps (long rounds), while ensuring
that the majority of steps (short rounds) involve only balanced, short
rollouts. By excluding long responses from short rounds and rescheduling them
into a few designated long rounds, tail batching effectively reduces GPU idle
time during rollouts and significantly accelerates RL training without
sacrificing accuracy. We present RollPacker, a system that fully harnesses the
benefits of tail batching through holistic optimizations across all three RL
stages: elastic parallelism adaptation for rollout, dynamic resource allocation
and scheduling for reward, and stream-based training. Empirical results show
that RollPacker achieves a 2.03x-2.56x end-to-end training time reduction
compared to veRL and up to 2.24x speedup compared to RLHFuse for the Qwen2.5
family of LLMs on up to 128 H800 GPUs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着高性能计算集群性能主要依赖于GPU，需要加速域分解方法中的Schur补矩阵计算。显式组装密集Schur补矩阵成本高昂，是GPU加速的主要开销。

Method: 通过利用输入矩阵的稀疏性来优化GPU上的Schur补矩阵组装过程，在FETI方法框架下实现更高效的GPU计算。

Result: 在FETI方法中实现了GPU部分代码5.1倍的加速和整体组装3.3倍的加速，使得从仅10次迭代开始就能获得加速效益。

Conclusion: 智能利用输入矩阵稀疏性可以显著改进GPU上的Schur补矩阵组装性能，使GPU加速在更少的迭代次数下就具有实际效益。

Abstract: Schur complement matrices emerge in many domain decomposition methods that
can solve complex engineering problems using supercomputers. Today, as most of
the high-performance clusters' performance lies in GPUs, these methods should
also be accelerated.
  Typically, the offloaded components are the explicitly assembled dense Schur
complement matrices used later in the iterative solver for multiplication with
a vector. As the explicit assembly is expensive, it represents a significant
overhead associated with this approach to acceleration. It has already been
shown that the overhead can be minimized by assembling the Schur complements
directly on the GPU.
  This paper shows that the GPU assembly can be further improved by wisely
utilizing the sparsity of the input matrices. In the context of FETI methods,
we achieved a speedup of 5.1 in the GPU section of the code and 3.3 for the
whole assembly, making the acceleration beneficial from as few as 10
iterations.

TL;DR: 本文提出弹性流水线并行（EPP）方法，通过协调token级和batch级流水线并行来适应资源和负载异质性，并构建了InfiniPipe系统，实现了1.69倍的性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 长上下文训练对LLM上下文扩展至关重要。现有方案如序列并行会产生大量通信开销。流水线并行（PP）能降低此成本，但其效果取决于分区粒度。batch级PP在长上下文场景下内存消耗高，而token级PP能缓解内存开销但可能导致硬件利用率不足。此外，真实数据集序列长度分布的偏斜性对PP的负载均衡和高效调度构成挑战。

Method: 提出弹性流水线并行（EPP），协调token级和batch级PP以适应资源和负载异质性。构建InfiniPipe系统，包含：(1)资源感知和负载均衡的序列处理器，分割长序列并打包短序列；(2)协同优化方法，通过阶段感知的块级自适应检查点机制联合优化流水线调度和梯度检查点。

Result: 综合实验表明，InfiniPipe相比最先进系统实现了1.69倍的加速比。

Conclusion: EPP方法有效解决了长上下文训练中的资源利用和负载均衡问题，InfiniPipe系统通过创新的调度和优化机制显著提升了训练效率。

Abstract: Long context training is crucial for LLM's context extension. Existing
schemes, such as sequence parallelism, incur substantial communication
overhead. Pipeline parallelism (PP) reduces this cost, but its effectiveness
hinges on partitioning granularity. Batch-level PP dividing input samples
exhibits high memory consumption in long-context scenario, whereas token-level
PP splitting sequences into slices alleviates memory overhead but may incur
hardware under-utilization. This trade-off motivates adaptively selecting PP
granularity to match resource and workload characteristics. Moreover, sequence
length distribution of the real-world dataset exhibits skewness, posing a
challenge on PP's workload balance and efficient scheduling. Current static PP
scheduling methods overlook the variance of sequence length, leading to
suboptimal performance. In this paper, we propose Elastic Pipeline Parallelism
(EPP) that orchestrates token-level PP and batch-level PP to adapt to resource
and workload heterogeneity. We build InfiniPipe, a distributed training system
that unleashes the potential of EPP via (1) a resource-aware and
workload-balanced sequence processor that splits long sequences and packs short
ones; and (2) a co-optimization methodology that jointly optimizes pipeline
schedule and gradient checkpointing via a mechanism named stage-aware
chunk-level adaptive checkpointing. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that
InfiniPipe achieves a 1.69x speedup over state-of-the-art systems.

implementation could be obtained, it could be easily adapted for pedagogical
and amateur use. In this work we accomplish three goals in relation to this
outlook. First, we propose a set of criteria for evaluating the components of a
RISC-V implementation's ecosystem from a pedagogical perspective. Second, we
analyze a number of existing open-source RISC-V implementations to determine
how many of the criteria they fulfill. We then develop a comprehensive solution
that meets all of these criterion and is released open-source for other
instructors to use. The framework is developed in a composable way that it's
different components can be disaggregated per individual course needs. Finally,
we also report on a limited study of student feedback.

Abstract: As processors increase in complexity, costs grow even more rapidly, both for
functional verification and performance validation. Most often, silicon
characterizations comprise simple performance counters, which are aggregated
and separated to tell a story. Based on these inferences, performance engineers
employ microarchitectural simulation to inspect deeply into the core.
Unfortunately, dramatically longer runtimes make simulation infeasible for long
workloads.
  We propose a Scale-Down approach to modelling and validation. Rather than
up-sizing a prototyping platform to fit large and complex system designs, we
show that it can be more accurate, faster, and more economical to decompose a
system into manageable sub-components that can be prototyped independently. By
carefully designing the prototyping interface, it is possible to adhere to
strict non-interference of the Device Under Test (DUT). This allows architects
to have the best of both worlds: the speed of FPGA acceleration while
eliminating the inaccuracies of Scale-Out and the inherent costs of Scale-Up.
  In this work, we present ZynqParrot: a Scale-Down FPGA-based modelling
platform, capable of executing non-interfering, cycle-accurate co-emulations of
arbitrary RTL designs. ZynqParrot is capable of verifying functionality and
performance with arbitrary granularity. We also provide case studies using
ZynqParrot to analyze the full-stack performance of an open-source RISC-V
processor.
