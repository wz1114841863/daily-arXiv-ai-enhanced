### [1] [History-Aware Trajectory k-Anonymization Using an FPGA-Based Hardware Accelerator for Real-Time Location Services](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09688)
*Hiroshi Nakano,Hiroaki Nishi*

Main category: cs.AR

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合历史轨迹和最短路径的FPGA实时轨迹k-匿名化方法，相比仅使用最短路径的方法，能更好地保护用户隐私并保持数据实用性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 之前的FPGA轨迹匿名化方法仅依赖最短路径计算，无法捕捉真实出行行为，降低了匿名化数据的实用性。

Method: 开发了新型FPGA硬件架构，集成并行历史轨迹搜索和传统最短路径查找，使用自定义定点计数模块准确加权历史数据贡献。

Result: 实现超过6,000条记录/秒的实时吞吐量，数据保留率比之前设计提高1.2%，更有效地保留主干道路。

Conclusion: 该架构在LBS严格延迟约束下实现了高保真、历史感知的匿名化，同时保护隐私和行为准确性。

Abstract: Our previous work established the feasibility of FPGA-based real-time trajectory anonymization, a critical task for protecting user privacy in modern location-based services (LBS). However, that pioneering approach relied exclusively on shortest-path computations, which can fail to capture re- alistic travel behavior and thus reduce the utility of the anonymized data. To address this limitation, this paper introduces a novel, history-aware trajectory k-anonymization methodology and presents an advanced FPGA-based hardware architecture to implement it. Our proposed architecture uniquely integrates par- allel history-based trajectory searches with conventional shortest- path finding, using a custom fixed-point counting module to ac- curately weigh contributions from historical data. This approach enables the system to prioritize behaviorally common routes over geometrically shorter but less-traveled paths. The FPGA implementation demonstrates that our new architecture achieves a real-time throughput of over 6,000 records/s, improves data retention by up to 1.2% compared to our previous shortest-path- only design, and preserves major arterial roads more effectively. These results signify a key advancement, enabling high-fidelity, history-aware anonymization that preserves both privacy and behavioral accuracy under the strict latency constraints of LBS.

### [2] [AssertMiner: Module-Level Spec Generation and Assertion Mining using Static Analysis Guided LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10007)
*Hongqin Lyu,Yonghao Wang,Jiaxin Zhou,Zhiteng Chao,Tiancheng Wang,Huawei Li*

Main category: cs.AR

TL;DR: AssertMiner是一个模块级断言生成框架，利用AST静态信息辅助LLM挖掘模块级断言，提升验证覆盖率和错误检测能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于设计规范的断言生成方法通常只产生顶层断言，忽略了微架构级别模块中更频繁发生设计错误的实现细节验证需求。

Method: 通过AST结构提取获取模块调用图、I/O表和数据流图，指导LLM生成模块级规范并挖掘模块级断言。

Result: AssertMiner在生成高质量模块断言方面优于AssertLLM和Spec2Assertion，集成这些方法后可显著提升结构覆盖率和错误检测能力。

Conclusion: AssertMiner能够实现更全面高效的验证过程，解决了模块级验证的局限性。

Abstract: Assertion-based verification (ABV) is a key approach to checking whether a logic design complies with its architectural specifications. Existing assertion generation methods based on design specifications typically produce only top-level assertions, overlooking verification needs on the implementation details in the modules at the micro-architectural level, where design errors occur more frequently. To address this limitation, we present AssertMiner, a module-level assertion generation framework that leverages static information generated from abstract syntax tree (AST) to assist LLMs in mining assertions. Specifically, it performs AST-based structural extraction to derive the module call graph, I/O table, and dataflow graph, guiding the LLM to generate module-level specifications and mine module-level assertions. Our evaluation demonstrates that AssertMiner outperforms existing methods such as AssertLLM and Spec2Assertion in generating high-quality assertions for modules. When integrated with these methods, AssertMiner can enhance the structural coverage and significantly improve the error detection capability, enabling a more comprehensive and efficient verification process.

Abstract: The remarkable progress in Artificial Intelligence (AI) is foundation-ally linked to a concurrent revolution in computer architecture. As AI models, particularly Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), have grown in complexity, their massive computational demands have pushed traditional architectures to their limits. This paper provides a structured review of this co-evolution, analyzing the architectural landscape designed to accelerate modern AI workloads. We explore the dominant architectural paradigms Graphics Processing Units (GPUs), Appli-cation-Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs), and Field-Programmable Gate Ar-rays (FPGAs) by breaking down their design philosophies, key features, and per-formance trade-offs. The core principles essential for performance and energy efficiency, including dataflow optimization, advanced memory hierarchies, spar-sity, and quantization, are analyzed. Furthermore, this paper looks ahead to emerging technologies such as Processing-in-Memory (PIM) and neuromorphic computing, which may redefine future computation. By synthesizing architec-tural principles with quantitative performance data from industry-standard benchmarks, this survey presents a comprehensive picture of the AI accelerator landscape. We conclude that AI and computer architecture are in a symbiotic relationship, where hardware-software co-design is no longer an optimization but a necessity for future progress in computing.

Abstract: The demand for computer in our daily lives has led to the proliferation of Datacenters that power indispensable many services. On the other hand, computing has become essential for some research for various scientific fields, that require Supercomputers with vast computing capabilities to produce results in reasonable time. The scale and complexity of these systems, compared to our day-to-day devices, are like comparing a cell to a living organism. To make them work properly, we need state-of-the-art technology and engineering, not just raw resources. Interconnecting the different computer nodes that make up a whole is a delicate task, as it can become the bottleneck for the whole infrastructure. In this work, we explore two aspects of the network: how to prevent degradation under heavy use with congestion control, and how to save energy when idle with power management; and how the two may interact.

### [5] [Beamspace Equalization for mmWave Massive MIMO: Algorithms and VLSI Implementations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10563)
*Seyed Hadi Mirfarshbafan,Christoph Studer*

Main category: cs.AR

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于波束空间处理的复杂稀疏自适应均衡器(CSPADE)及其VLSI架构，用于毫米波大规模MIMO系统，相比天线域均衡器可节省高达66%的功耗。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模MIMO和毫米波通信在部署时会带来过高的基带处理硬件成本和功耗，需要利用毫米波频段的信道稀疏性来降低基带处理复杂度。

Method: 提出复杂稀疏自适应均衡器(CSPADE)算法及对应的VLSI架构，包括全并行实现和基于顺序MAC的架构。

Result: 在22nm FDSOI工艺中实现，全并行CSPADE相比天线域均衡节省54%功耗，基于MAC的架构节省66%功耗，同时达到现有大规模MIMO数据检测器中最高的吞吐量。

Conclusion: 波束空间处理能有效降低大规模MIMO系统的功耗，提出的CSPADE架构在功耗、吞吐量和能效方面均表现优异。

Abstract: Massive multiuser multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) and millimeter-wave (mmWave) communication are key physical layer technologies in future wireless systems. Their deployment, however, is expected to incur excessive baseband processing hardware cost and power consumption. Beamspace processing leverages the channel sparsity at mmWave frequencies to reduce baseband processing complexity. In this paper, we review existing beamspace data detection algorithms and propose new algorithms as well as corresponding VLSI architectures that reduce data detection power. We present VLSI implementation results for the proposed architectures in a 22nm FDSOI process. Our results demonstrate that a fully-parallelized implementation of the proposed complex sparsity-adaptive equalizer (CSPADE) achieves up to 54% power savings compared to antenna-domain equalization. Furthermore, our fully-parallelized designs achieve the highest reported throughput among existing massive MIMO data detectors, while achieving better energy and area efficiency. We also present a sequential multiply-accumulate (MAC)-based architecture for CSPADE, which enables even higher power savings, i.e., up to 66%, compared to a MAC-based antenna-domain equalizer.

*Josse Van Delm,Anton Lydike,Joren Dumoulin,Jonas Crols,Xiaoling Yi,Ryan Antonio,Jackson Woodruff,Tobias Grosser,Marian Verhelst*

Main category: cs.PF

TL;DR: 本文提出了配置墙问题——随着硬件加速器复杂度的增加，CPU在配置控制和同步上的时间开销限制了系统性能。作者引入了一种改进的roofline模型来量化配置约束性能，并提出了领域特定的编译器抽象和优化通道来消除冗余配置周期并隐藏剩余配置开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代计算平台越来越多地将计算内核从CPU卸载到集成硬件加速器以实现最佳能效，但随着加速器复杂度的增加，CPU在配置控制和同步上的时间开销也随之增加，导致性能受到配置限制，形成所谓的"配置墙"问题。

Method: 1) 引入改进的roofline模型来量化配置约束性能；2) 提出领域特定的编译器抽象和相关优化通道；3) 在MLIR编译器框架中实现该抽象和优化通道；4) 通过消除冗余配置周期和自动隐藏剩余配置周期来优化性能。

Result: 在开源OpenGeMM系统上的实验表明，通过该方法实现了2倍的几何平均性能提升。

Conclusion: 该工作提供了关于加速器性能如何受配置机制影响的关键见解，促进了自动代码生成以规避配置墙问题。

Abstract: Contemporary compute platforms increasingly offload compute kernels from CPU to integrated hardware accelerators to reach maximum performance per Watt. Unfortunately, the time the CPU spends on setup control and synchronization has increased with growing accelerator complexity. For systems with complex accelerators, this means that performance can be configuration-bound. Faster accelerators are more severely impacted by this overlooked performance drop, which we call the configuration wall. Prior work evidences this wall and proposes ad-hoc solutions to reduce configuration overhead. However, these solutions are not universally applicable, nor do they offer comprehensive insights into the underlying causes of performance degradation. In this work, we first introduce a widely-applicable variant of the well-known roofline model to quantify when system performance is configuration-bound. To move systems out of the performance-bound region, we subsequently propose a domain-specific compiler abstraction and associated optimization passes. We implement the abstraction and passes in the MLIR compiler framework to run optimized binaries on open-source architectures to prove its effectiveness and generality. Experiments demonstrate a geomean performance boost of 2x on the open-source OpenGeMM system, by eliminating redundant configuration cycles and by automatically hiding the remaining configuration cycles. Our work provides key insights in how accelerator performance is affected by setup mechanisms, thereby facilitating automatic code generation for circumventing the configuration wall.

### [7] [Probability-Biased Attention over Directed Bipartite Graphs for Long-Tail ICD Coding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09559)
*Tianlei Chen,Yuxiao Chen,Yang Li,Feifei Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于有向二分图编码器的自动化ICD编码方法，通过建模常见代码与罕见代码之间的细粒度共现关系，利用LLM生成代码描述增强嵌入，在长尾分布下显著提升Macro-F1性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动化ICD编码面临大规模标签空间（10,000-20,000个代码）和长尾分布挑战，少数常见代码主导而许多罕见代码缺乏足够训练数据。

Method: 构建有向二分图编码器，包含常见和罕见代码节点，边仅从常见代码指向罕见代码。基于条件概率定义连接偏置，注入注意力模块进行共现编码。使用LLM生成代码描述增强初始嵌入。

Result: 在三个自动化ICD编码基准数据集上实现了最先进的性能，特别是在长尾分类关键指标Macro-F1上有显著提升。

Conclusion: 该方法通过建模代码间共现关系和利用LLM增强嵌入，有效解决了ICD编码中的长尾分布问题，为罕见代码提供了更好的表示学习。

Abstract: Automated International Classification of Diseases (ICD) coding aims to assign multiple disease codes to clinical documents, constituting a crucial multi-label text classification task in healthcare informatics. However, the task is challenging due to its large label space (10,000 to 20,000 codes) and long-tail distribution, where a few codes dominate while many rare codes lack sufficient training data. To address this, we propose a learning method that models fine-grained co-occurrence relationships among codes. Specifically, we construct a Directed Bipartite Graph Encoder with disjoint sets of common and rare code nodes. To facilitate a one-way information flow, edges are directed exclusively from common to rare codes. The nature of these connections is defined by a probability-based bias, which is derived from the conditional probability of a common code co-occurring given the presence of a rare code. This bias is then injected into the encoder's attention module, a process we term Co-occurrence Encoding. This structure empowers the graph encoder to enrich rare code representations by aggregating latent comorbidity information reflected in the statistical co-occurrence of their common counterparts. To ensure high-quality input to the graph, we utilize a large language model (LLM) to generate comprehensive descriptions for codes, enriching initial embeddings with clinical context and comorbidity information, serving as external knowledge for the statistical co-occurrence relationships in the code system. Experiments on three automated ICD coding benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance with particularly notable improvements in Macro-F1, which is the key metric for long-tail classification.

### [8] [Steering Pretrained Drafters during Speculative Decoding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09844)
*Frédéric Berdoz,Peer Rheinboldt,Roger Wattenhofer*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出一种轻量级动态对齐机制，通过从验证器的隐藏状态计算转向向量并注入预训练的起草器，显著提高接受率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 推测解码的主要限制是起草器-验证器不对齐，这会限制令牌接受并降低整体效率。预训练的起草器虽然较慢，但接受率更高，需要改进其对齐效果。

Method: 引入轻量级动态对齐机制：从验证器的隐藏状态计算转向向量，并将其注入预训练的起草器中。

Result: 在标准采样下接受令牌数量提升高达35%，在贪婪采样下提升22%，同时计算开销可忽略不计。

Conclusion: 该方法可适配现有架构和预训练模型，实现快速采用，显著提升推测解码的效率。

Abstract: Speculative decoding accelerates language model inference by separating generation into fast drafting and parallel verification. Its main limitation is drafter-verifier misalignment, which limits token acceptance and reduces overall effectiveness. While small drafting heads trained from scratch compensate with speed, they struggle when verification dominates latency or when inputs are out of distribution. In contrast, pretrained drafters, though slower, achieve higher acceptance rates thanks to stronger standalone generation capabilities, making them competitive when drafting latency is negligible relative to verification or communication overhead. In this work, we aim to improve the acceptance rates of pretrained drafters by introducing a lightweight dynamic alignment mechanism: a steering vector computed from the verifier's hidden states and injected into the pretrained drafter. Compared to existing offline alignment methods such as distillation, our approach boosts the number of accepted tokens by up to 35\% under standard sampling and 22\% under greedy sampling, all while incurring negligible computational overhead. Importantly, our approach can be retrofitted to existing architectures and pretrained models, enabling rapid adoption.

### [9] [Let the Experts Speak: Improving Survival Prediction & Calibration via Mixture-of-Experts Heads](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09567)
*Todd Morrill,Aahlad Puli,Murad Megjhani,Soojin Park,Richard Zemel*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文提出了几种基于离散时间的深度混合专家模型用于生存分析，其中一种模型能够同时实现聚类、校准和预测准确性的目标。研究发现，表达能力更强的专家模型通过为每个患者定制预测，优于依赖固定组原型的专家模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的混合专家模型在生存分析中虽然能够聚类相似患者，但往往以牺牲校准误差和预测准确性为代价。这是因为混合专家模型施加了限制性归纳偏差，即个体患者的预测必须与其所属组的预测相似。

Method: 引入了多种基于离散时间的深度混合专家架构用于生存分析问题，比较了不同表达能力水平的专家模型。

Result: 研究发现表达能力更强的专家模型能够为每个患者定制预测，从而在聚类、校准和预测准确性方面都表现更好。

Conclusion: 在生存分析中，使用表达能力更强的专家模型能够同时实现患者聚类、模型校准和预测准确性的目标，优于依赖固定组原型的传统方法。

Abstract: Deep mixture-of-experts models have attracted a lot of attention for survival analysis problems, particularly for their ability to cluster similar patients together. In practice, grouping often comes at the expense of key metrics such calibration error and predictive accuracy. This is due to the restrictive inductive bias that mixture-of-experts imposes, that predictions for individual patients must look like predictions for the group they're assigned to. Might we be able to discover patient group structure, where it exists, while improving calibration and predictive accuracy? In this work, we introduce several discrete-time deep mixture-of-experts (MoE) based architectures for survival analysis problems, one of which achieves all desiderata: clustering, calibration, and predictive accuracy. We show that a key differentiator between this array of MoEs is how expressive their experts are. We find that more expressive experts that tailor predictions per patient outperform experts that rely on fixed group prototypes.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: JMFNet是一种基于模型的深度学习框架，用于具有未知噪声统计和模式转换动态的跳变马尔可夫系统的实时状态估计。该混合架构包含两个RNN：一个用于模式预测，另一个基于KalmanNet的滤波网络。通过交替最小二乘策略联合训练，在非平稳和高噪声环境下优于传统模型滤波器和无模型深度学习方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统跳变马尔可夫系统的状态估计方法需要已知噪声统计和模式转换动态，但在实际应用中这些参数往往是未知的。现有的深度学习方法缺乏模型结构，在复杂系统中性能受限。

Method: 提出混合架构：两个RNN分别负责模式预测和状态滤波，其中滤波网络基于KalmanNet架构。采用交替最小二乘策略进行无监督联合训练，无需潜在模式的监督信息。

Result: 在线性和非线性系统（目标跟踪、摆角跟踪、Lorenz吸引子等）上的实验表明，JMFNet在非平稳和高噪声环境下优于传统模型滤波器和无模型深度学习方法。相比KalmanNet有显著改进，特别是在复杂系统或长轨迹中。

Conclusion: JMFNet框架在未知噪声统计和模式转换动态的跳变马尔可夫系统中表现出色，具有一致可靠的性能，对初始条件、超参数选择和模型知识错误具有低敏感性。

Abstract: This paper presents the Jump Markov Filtering Network (JMFNet), a novel model-based deep learning framework for real-time state-state estimation in jump Markov systems with unknown noise statistics and mode transition dynamics. A hybrid architecture comprising two Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) is proposed: one for mode prediction and another for filtering that is based on a mode-augmented version of the recently presented KalmanNet architecture. The proposed RNNs are trained jointly using an alternating least squares strategy that enables mutual adaptation without supervision of the latent modes. Extensive numerical experiments on linear and nonlinear systems, including target tracking, pendulum angle tracking, Lorenz attractor dynamics, and a real-life dataset demonstrate that the proposed JMFNet framework outperforms classical model-based filters (e.g., interacting multiple models and particle filters) as well as model-free deep learning baselines, particularly in non-stationary and high-noise regimes. It is also showcased that JMFNet achieves a small yet meaningful improvement over the KalmanNet framework, which becomes much more pronounced in complicated systems or long trajectories. Finally, the method's performance is empirically validated to be consistent and reliable, exhibiting low sensitivity to initial conditions, hyperparameter selection, as well as to incorrect model knowledge

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了EDGC框架，一种基于梯度熵的动态梯度压缩方法，通过在LLM训练过程中根据梯度熵变化动态调整压缩率，显著减少通信延迟和训练时间，同时保持模型精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 训练大型语言模型面临计算资源和内存容量的挑战，现有静态梯度压缩方法忽略了训练过程中梯度动态变化的特性，导致性能下降。如何在压缩加速的同时不牺牲性能仍是挑战。

Method: EDGC框架包含三个核心组件：1）使用下采样方法高效估计梯度熵；2）建立压缩率与梯度熵的理论模型；3）基于窗口的调整机制在流水线阶段动态适应压缩率。

Result: 在32-NVIDIA-V100和64-NVIDIA-H100集群上分别训练GPT2-2.5B和GPT2-12.1B，EDGC将通信延迟和训练时间分别减少高达46.45%和16.13%，同时保持LLM精度。

Conclusion: EDGC通过动态调整压缩率有效解决了LLM训练中的通信瓶颈问题，在显著提升训练效率的同时保持了模型性能。

Abstract: Training large language models (LLMs) poses significant challenges regarding computational resources and memory capacity. Although distributed training techniques help mitigate these issues, they still suffer from considerable communication overhead. Existing approaches primarily rely on static gradient compression to enhance communication efficiency; however, these methods neglect the dynamic nature of evolving gradients during training, leading to performance degradation. Accelerating LLM training via compression without sacrificing performance remains a challenge. In this paper, we propose an entropy-driven dynamic gradient compression framework called EDGC. The core concept is to adjust the compression rate during LLM training based on the evolving trends of gradient entropy, taking into account both compression efficiency and error. EDGC consists of three key components.First, it employs a down-sampling method to efficiently estimate gradient entropy, reducing computation overhead. Second, it establishes a theoretical model linking compression rate with gradient entropy, enabling more informed compression decisions. Lastly, a window-based adjustment mechanism dynamically adapts the compression rate across pipeline stages, improving communication efficiency and maintaining model performance. We implemented EDGC on a 32-NVIDIA-V100 cluster and a 64-NVIDIA-H100 cluster to train GPT2-2.5B and GPT2-12.1B, respectively. The results show that EDGC significantly reduces communication latency and training time by up to 46.45% and 16.13% while preserving LLM accuracy.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出使用群平均技术使任何训练好的模型在测试时具有精确的等变性，无需改变模型结构或训练过程，能显著提高预测精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 许多自然科学中的机器学习任务需要特定的对称性等变性，但等变方法常因训练困难、期望模型自行学习对称性或实现复杂而未被采用。群平均技术可解决这些问题。

Method: 在评估时对训练好的模型进行小规模对称群的平均操作，该方法成本低且不依赖模型结构或训练过程。

Result: 实验表明群平均始终降低评估损失，VRMSE指标提升最高达37%，对连续动力学产生视觉上更好的预测结果。

Conclusion: 在常见情况下施加精确对称性没有缺点，群平均是提高模型精度的廉价简单方法，ML4PS社区应考虑采用。

Abstract: Many machine learning tasks in the natural sciences are precisely equivariant to particular symmetries. Nonetheless, equivariant methods are often not employed, perhaps because training is perceived to be challenging, or the symmetry is expected to be learned, or equivariant implementations are seen as hard to build. Group averaging is an available technique for these situations. It happens at test time; it can make any trained model precisely equivariant at a (often small) cost proportional to the size of the group; it places no requirements on model structure or training. It is known that, under mild conditions, the group-averaged model will have a provably better prediction accuracy than the original model. Here we show that an inexpensive group averaging can improve accuracy in practice. We take well-established benchmark machine learning models of differential equations in which certain symmetries ought to be obeyed. At evaluation time, we average the models over a small group of symmetries. Our experiments show that this procedure always decreases the average evaluation loss, with improvements of up to 37\% in terms of the VRMSE. The averaging produces visually better predictions for continuous dynamics. This short paper shows that, under certain common circumstances, there are no disadvantages to imposing exact symmetries; the ML4PS community should consider group averaging as a cheap and simple way to improve model accuracy.

TL;DR: 提出基于引导去噪扩散概率模型(DDPM)的生成优化框架，利用代理梯度生成最小化压降并保持表面温度低于阈值的热沉设计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统黑盒优化方法(如CMA-ES)在热沉设计优化中存在可扩展性差和计算成本高的问题，需要开发更高效、可扩展的生成优化方法。

Method: 使用边界表示法表示多翅片几何结构，采用多保真度方法生成训练数据。训练DDPM生成热沉设计，并训练两个残差神经网络预测压降和表面温度，利用代理梯度引导几何生成过程满足约束条件。

Result: 引导扩散模型生成的样本比传统黑盒优化方法获得的压降低限值低10%。

Conclusion: 该方法为构建电子冷却基础生成模型迈出了重要一步，具有可扩展性和计算效率优势。

Abstract: This study presents a generative optimization framework based on a guided denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM) that leverages surrogate gradients to generate heat sink designs minimizing pressure drop while maintaining surface temperatures below a specified threshold. Geometries are represented using boundary representations of multiple fins, and a multi-fidelity approach is employed to generate training data. Using this dataset, along with vectors representing the boundary representation geometries, we train a denoising diffusion probabilistic model to generate heat sinks with characteristics consistent with those observed in the data. We train two different residual neural networks to predict the pressure drop and surface temperature for each geometry. We use the gradients of these surrogate models with respect to the design variables to guide the geometry generation process toward satisfying the low-pressure and surface temperature constraints. This inference-time guidance directs the generative process toward heat sink designs that not only prevent overheating but also achieve lower pressure drops compared to traditional optimization methods such as CMA-ES. In contrast to traditional black-box optimization approaches, our method is scalable, provided sufficient training data is available. Unlike traditional topology optimization methods, once the model is trained and the heat sink world model is saved, inference under new constraints (e.g., temperature) is computationally inexpensive and does not require retraining. Samples generated using the guided diffusion model achieve pressure drops up to 10 percent lower than the limits obtained by traditional black-box optimization methods. This work represents a step toward building a foundational generative model for electronics cooling.

Abstract: LLM-based agents can autonomously accomplish complex tasks across various domains. However, to further cultivate capabilities such as adaptive behavior and long-term decision-making, training on static datasets built from human-level knowledge is insufficient. These datasets are costly to construct and lack both dynamism and realism. A growing consensus is that agents should instead interact directly with environments and learn from experience through reinforcement learning. We formalize this iterative process as the Generation-Execution-Feedback (GEF) loop, where environments generate tasks to challenge agents, return observations in response to agents' actions during task execution, and provide evaluative feedback on rollouts for subsequent learning. Under this paradigm, environments function as indispensable producers of experiential data, highlighting the need to scale them toward greater complexity, realism, and interactivity. In this survey, we systematically review representative methods for environment scaling from a pioneering environment-centric perspective and organize them along the stages of the GEF loop, namely task generation, task execution, and feedback. We further analyze benchmarks, implementation strategies, and applications, consolidating fragmented advances and outlining future research directions for agent intelligence.

TL;DR: DR-GNN是一种新颖的图神经网络方法，通过结合静态结构和多周期执行行为来学习RTL电路表示，在分支命中预测和翻转率预测等任务上优于现有模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的图神经网络主要关注电路的静态特性，无法捕捉电路运行时行为，而这对电路验证和优化等任务至关重要。

Method: 使用操作符级控制数据流图表示RTL电路，结合静态结构和多周期执行行为，构建包含6300个Verilog设计和63000个仿真轨迹的动态电路数据集进行训练。

Result: DR-GNN在分支命中预测和翻转率预测任务上表现优于现有模型，其学习到的表示能有效迁移到功耗估计和断言预测等相关动态电路任务。

Conclusion: DR-GNN通过整合静态和动态信息，能够有效捕捉电路运行时行为，为电路验证和优化提供了更强大的表示学习能力。

Abstract: There is a growing body of work on using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to learn representations of circuits, focusing primarily on their static characteristics. However, these models fail to capture circuit runtime behavior, which is crucial for tasks like circuit verification and optimization. To address this limitation, we introduce DR-GNN (DynamicRTL-GNN), a novel approach that learns RTL circuit representations by incorporating both static structures and multi-cycle execution behaviors. DR-GNN leverages an operator-level Control Data Flow Graph (CDFG) to represent Register Transfer Level (RTL) circuits, enabling the model to capture dynamic dependencies and runtime execution. To train and evaluate DR-GNN, we build the first comprehensive dynamic circuit dataset, comprising over 6,300 Verilog designs and 63,000 simulation traces. Our results demonstrate that DR-GNN outperforms existing models in branch hit prediction and toggle rate prediction. Furthermore, its learned representations transfer effectively to related dynamic circuit tasks, achieving strong performance in power estimation and assertion prediction.

*Houming Wu,Ling Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TawPipe是一种拓扑感知的权重流水线并行方法，通过利用分布式集群中的分层带宽来优化通信效率，解决了传统流水线并行中激活通信开销大的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 训练大语言模型受到设备内存限制和昂贵设备间通信的制约。传统流水线并行虽然缓解了内存压力，但激活通信开销随序列长度线性增长，限制了长上下文训练的效率。现有的权重传递方法存在冗余的点对点传输和节点内带宽利用不足的问题。

Method: TawPipe通过以下方式优化通信效率：(i) 基于拓扑对设备进行分组，优化节点内集体通信和节点间点对点通信；(ii) 为每个设备分配固定的模型权重和梯度分片，避免冗余传输；(iii) 将通信与计算重叠以隐藏延迟。与FSDP的全局集体操作不同，TawPipe将大部分通信限制在节点边界内。

Result: 在最多24个GPU上使用LLaMA风格模型进行的广泛实验表明，TawPipe相比最先进的基线方法实现了更优的吞吐量和可扩展性。

Conclusion: TawPipe通过拓扑感知的权重流水线并行方法，显著减少了跨节点通信流量，在大语言模型训练中提供了更好的通信效率和可扩展性。

Abstract: Training large language models (LLMs) is fundamentally constrained by limited device memory and costly inter-device communication. Although pipeline parallelism alleviates memory pressure by partitioning models across devices, it incurs activation communication overhead that scales linearly with sequence length, limiting efficiency in long-context training. Recent weight-passing approaches (e.g., WeiPipe) mitigate this by transmitting model weights instead of activations, but suffer from redundant peer-to-peer (P2P) transfers and underutilized intra-node bandwidth. We propose TawPipe--topology-aware weight pipeline parallelism, which exploits hierarchical bandwidth in distributed clusters for improved communication efficiency. TawPipe: (i) groups devices based on topology to optimize intra-node collective and inter-node P2P communication; (ii) assigns each device a fixed shard of model weights and gradients, avoiding redundant transfers; and (iii) overlaps communication with computation to hide latency. Unlike global collective operations used in fully sharded data parallelism (FSDP), TawPipe confines most communication within node boundaries, significantly reducing cross-node traffic. Extensive experiments on up to 24 GPUs with LLaMA-style models show that TawPipe achieves superior throughput and scalability compared to state-of-the-art baselines.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SPAttention通过引入"原则性结构稀疏性"新范式，将多头注意力计算从H个独立的O(N²)计算转变为单个协作的O(N²)计算，将复杂度降低H倍，在保持性能的同时实现约两倍的训练吞吐量提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLM核心注意力机制中计算复杂度O(H·N²)与表达能力之间的根本冲突，现有稀疏方法往往牺牲信息完整性换取计算效率。

Method: 将总注意力工作负载划分为平衡、非重叠的距离带，为每个头分配唯一片段，强制头间功能专业化，实现计算资源从冗余建模到跨序列跨度不同依赖的更高效分配。

Result: 在OLMoE-1B-7B和0.25B-1.75B模型系列上验证，训练吞吐量提升约两倍，性能与标准密集注意力相当甚至在某些关键指标上超越，在所有评估指标上一致优于Longformer、Reformer和BigBird等代表性稀疏注意力方法。

Conclusion: SPAttention通过原则性结构稀疏性有效解决了效率-性能权衡问题，为LLM设计提供了新的注意力机制范式。

Abstract: The design of Large Language Models (LLMs) has long been hampered by a fundamental conflict within their core attention mechanism: its remarkable expressivity is built upon a computational complexity of $O(H \cdot N^2)$ that grows quadratically with the context size ($N$) and linearly with the number of heads ($H$). This standard implementation harbors significant computational redundancy, as all heads independently compute attention over the same sequence space. Existing sparse methods, meanwhile, often trade information integrity for computational efficiency. To resolve this efficiency-performance trade-off, we propose SPAttention, whose core contribution is the introduction of a new paradigm we term Principled Structural Sparsity. SPAttention does not merely drop connections but instead reorganizes the computational task by partitioning the total attention workload into balanced, non-overlapping distance bands, assigning each head a unique segment. This approach transforms the multi-head attention mechanism from $H$ independent $O(N^2)$ computations into a single, collaborative $O(N^2)$ computation, fundamentally reducing complexity by a factor of $H$. The structured inductive bias compels functional specialization among heads, enabling a more efficient allocation of computational resources from redundant modeling to distinct dependencies across the entire sequence span. Extensive empirical validation on the OLMoE-1B-7B and 0.25B-1.75B model series demonstrates that while delivering an approximately two-fold increase in training throughput, its performance is on par with standard dense attention, even surpassing it on select key metrics, while consistently outperforming representative sparse attention methods including Longformer, Reformer, and BigBird across all evaluation metrics.

Result: 在多个真实数据集上的验证显示，SMoFi能提升全局模型准确性达7.1%，收敛速度提升达10.25倍，在更多客户端和更深模型时效果更显著。

Conclusion: SMoFi是轻量级且有效的框架，特别适用于资源受限环境下的模型训练，能有效应对数据异构性挑战。

Abstract: Split Federated Learning is a system-efficient federated learning paradigm that leverages the rich computing resources at a central server to train model partitions. Data heterogeneity across silos, however, presents a major challenge undermining the convergence speed and accuracy of the global model. This paper introduces Step-wise Momentum Fusion (SMoFi), an effective and lightweight framework that counteracts gradient divergence arising from data heterogeneity by synchronizing the momentum buffers across server-side optimizers. To control gradient divergence over the training process, we design a staleness-aware alignment mechanism that imposes constraints on gradient updates of the server-side submodel at each optimization step. Extensive validations on multiple real-world datasets show that SMoFi consistently improves global model accuracy (up to 7.1%) and convergence speed (up to 10.25$\times$). Furthermore, SMoFi has a greater impact with more clients involved and deeper learning models, making it particularly suitable for model training in resource-constrained contexts.

Motivation: 现实应用中需要在不同操作条件下解决昂贵的多目标优化问题族，这产生了参数化昂贵多目标优化问题(P-EMOPs)，其中每个任务参数定义一个独特的优化实例。现有方法无法处理连续任务参数空间中的无限问题。

Method: 交替进行：(1)利用任务间协同效应的获取驱动搜索，(2)通过条件生成模型进行生成解决方案采样。使用任务感知高斯过程理论证明更快收敛。

Conclusion: 该方法能够跨相关任务进行高效优化，最终实现对未见参数化EMOPs的直接解预测，无需额外昂贵评估。

Abstract: Many real-world applications require solving families of expensive multi-objective optimization problems~(EMOPs) under varying operational conditions. This gives rise to parametric expensive multi-objective optimization problems (P-EMOPs) where each task parameter defines a distinct optimization instance. Current multi-objective Bayesian optimization methods have been widely used for finding finite sets of Pareto optimal solutions for individual tasks. However, P-EMOPs present a fundamental challenge: the continuous task parameter space can contain infinite distinct problems, each requiring separate expensive evaluations. This demands learning an inverse model that can directly predict optimized solutions for any task-preference query without expensive re-evaluation. This paper introduces the first parametric multi-objective Bayesian optimizer that learns this inverse model by alternating between (1) acquisition-driven search leveraging inter-task synergies and (2) generative solution sampling via conditional generative models. This approach enables efficient optimization across related tasks and finally achieves direct solution prediction for unseen parameterized EMOPs without additional expensive evaluations. We theoretically justify the faster convergence by leveraging inter-task synergies through task-aware Gaussian processes. Meanwhile, empirical studies in synthetic and real-world benchmarks further verify the effectiveness of our alternating framework.

Conclusion: FedSTGD能够有效建模动态的客户端间空间依赖关系，在联邦学习环境中实现高性能，对超参数变化具有鲁棒性，为分布式交通数据建模提供了可行解决方案。

Abstract: Spatio-temporal graphs are powerful tools for modeling complex dependencies in traffic time series. However, the distributed nature of real-world traffic data across multiple stakeholders poses significant challenges in modeling and reconstructing inter-client spatial dependencies while adhering to data locality constraints. Existing methods primarily address static dependencies, overlooking their dynamic nature and resulting in suboptimal performance. In response, we propose Federated Spatio-Temporal Graph with Dynamic Inter-Client Dependencies (FedSTGD), a framework designed to model and reconstruct dynamic inter-client spatial dependencies in federated learning. FedSTGD incorporates a federated nonlinear computation decomposition module to approximate complex graph operations. This is complemented by a graph node embedding augmentation module, which alleviates performance degradation arising from the decomposition. These modules are coordinated through a client-server collective learning protocol, which decomposes dynamic inter-client spatial dependency learning tasks into lightweight, parallelizable subtasks. Extensive experiments on four real-world datasets demonstrate that FedSTGD achieves superior performance over state-of-the-art baselines in terms of RMSE, MAE, and MAPE, approaching that of centralized baselines. Ablation studies confirm the contribution of each module in addressing dynamic inter-client spatial dependencies, while sensitivity analysis highlights the robustness of FedSTGD to variations in hyperparameters.

Motivation: 传统强化学习基础未考虑目标函数的风险敏感性，这在医疗和金融等领域至关重要。通过优化累积奖励分布的特定分位数可以纳入风险敏感性。

Method: 开发了UCB-QRL算法，采用迭代方法：首先估计转移概率，然后在置信球内优化分位数价值函数。

Result: UCB-QRL在情景设置中获得了高概率遗憾界O((2/κ)^{H+1}H√(SATHlog(2SATH/δ)))，其中κ是捕捉MDP分位数价值敏感性的问题相关常数。

Conclusion: UCB-QRL为风险敏感的强化学习提供了一种有效的分位数优化方法，在有限时域MDP中具有理论保证的性能边界。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has achieved tremendous success in recent years. However, the classical foundations of RL do not account for the risk sensitivity of the objective function, which is critical in various fields, including healthcare and finance. A popular approach to incorporate risk sensitivity is to optimize a specific quantile of the cumulative reward distribution. In this paper, we develop UCB-QRL, an optimistic learning algorithm for the $τ$-quantile objective in finite-horizon Markov decision processes (MDPs). UCB-QRL is an iterative algorithm in which, at each iteration, we first estimate the underlying transition probability and then optimize the quantile value function over a confidence ball around this estimate. We show that UCB-QRL yields a high-probability regret bound $\mathcal O\left((2/κ)^{H+1}H\sqrt{SATH\log(2SATH/δ)}\right)$ in the episodic setting with $S$ states, $A$ actions, $T$ episodes, and $H$ horizons. Here, $κ>0$ is a problem-dependent constant that captures the sensitivity of the underlying MDP's quantile value.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 挑战当前观点：深度表格建模中的上下文学习需要在大规模合成语料库或大量真实数据上进行预训练才能实现广泛泛化。

Method: 在多个不同数据集上系统地进行自监督预训练和评估，分析数据的哪些方面对构建跨领域泛化的表格基础模型最重要。

Result: 发现相对少量的数据就足以实现泛化，单个真实表格的自监督预训练能在异构基准测试中产生强迁移效果。

Conclusion: 从数据集中可以构建的任务数量和质量是下游性能的关键，这连接了大多数表格基础模型共享的预训练过程。

Abstract: Deep tabular modelling increasingly relies on in-context learning where, during inference, a model receives a set of $(x,y)$ pairs as context and predicts labels for new inputs without weight updates. We challenge the prevailing view that broad generalization here requires pre-training on large synthetic corpora (e.g., TabPFN priors) or a large collection of real data (e.g., TabDPT training datasets), discovering that a relatively small amount of data suffices for generalization. We find that simple self-supervised pre-training on just a \emph{single} real table can produce surprisingly strong transfer across heterogeneous benchmarks. By systematically pre-training and evaluating on many diverse datasets, we analyze what aspects of the data are most important for building a Tabular Foundation Model (TFM) generalizing across domains. We then connect this to the pre-training procedure shared by most TFMs and show that the number and quality of \emph{tasks} one can construct from a dataset is key to downstream performance.

Motivation: 现有的差分隐私合成表格数据方法存在局限性：图形模型方法（如AIM）在高维数据上效率低下，需要大量内存且计算开销大；而基于生成器神经网络的方法（如GEM）主要在小型数据集上测试，限制了实际应用。

Method: GEM+整合了AIM的自适应测量框架和GEM的可扩展生成器网络，通过迭代测量低阶噪声边际并使用生成器神经网络来产生合成数据。

Result: 实验表明GEM+在效用和可扩展性方面均优于AIM，能够处理超过百列的数据集，而AIM由于内存和计算开销而无法处理此类高维数据。

Conclusion: GEM+通过结合自适应测量和可扩展生成器网络，为高维差分隐私合成数据提供了最先进的解决方案，在保持数据质量的同时显著提升了计算效率。

Abstract: State-of-the-art differentially private synthetic tabular data has been defined by adaptive 'select-measure-generate' frameworks, exemplified by methods like AIM. These approaches iteratively measure low-order noisy marginals and fit graphical models to produce synthetic data, enabling systematic optimisation of data quality under privacy constraints. Graphical models, however, are inefficient for high-dimensional data because they require substantial memory and must be retrained from scratch whenever the graph structure changes, leading to significant computational overhead. Recent methods, like GEM, overcome these limitations by using generator neural networks for improved scalability. However, empirical comparisons have mostly focused on small datasets, limiting real-world applicability. In this work, we introduce GEM+, which integrates AIM's adaptive measurement framework with GEM's scalable generator network. Our experiments show that GEM+ outperforms AIM in both utility and scalability, delivering state-of-the-art results while efficiently handling datasets with over a hundred columns, where AIM fails due to memory and computational overheads.

TL;DR: Boosted GFlowNets通过顺序训练集成模型来解决GFlowNets在探索奖励空间时的不平衡问题，每个后续模型优化残差奖励以补偿先前模型已捕获的质量，从而改善对高奖励区域的覆盖。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GFlowNets在实践中往往难以均匀探索奖励空间：容易到达区域的轨迹主导训练，而难以到达的模式获得消失或无效的梯度，导致高奖励区域覆盖不足。

Method: 提出Boosted GFlowNets方法，顺序训练GFlowNets集成，每个模型优化残差奖励来补偿先前模型已捕获的质量，重新激活未充分探索区域的学习信号。

Result: 在合成多模态基准和肽设计任务中，Boosted GFlowNets实现了显著更好的探索和样本多样性，同时保持了标准轨迹平衡训练的稳定性和简单性。

Conclusion: Boosted GFlowNets通过残差原则解决了GFlowNets的探索不平衡问题，确保学习分布不会恶化且通常得到改善，为组合对象采样提供了更有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNets) are powerful samplers for compositional objects that, by design, sample proportionally to a given non-negative reward. Nonetheless, in practice, they often struggle to explore the reward landscape evenly: trajectories toward easy-to-reach regions dominate training, while hard-to-reach modes receive vanishing or uninformative gradients, leading to poor coverage of high-reward areas. We address this imbalance with Boosted GFlowNets, a method that sequentially trains an ensemble of GFlowNets, each optimizing a residual reward that compensates for the mass already captured by previous models. This residual principle reactivates learning signals in underexplored regions and, under mild assumptions, ensures a monotone non-degradation property: adding boosters cannot worsen the learned distribution and typically improves it. Empirically, Boosted GFlowNets achieve substantially better exploration and sample diversity on multimodal synthetic benchmarks and peptide design tasks, while preserving the stability and simplicity of standard trajectory-balance training.

Motivation: 视觉强化学习在视觉控制和机器人领域取得显著进展，但其对抗扰动的脆弱性尚未充分探索。现有黑盒攻击主要针对基于向量或离散动作的RL，在图像连续控制中受限于大动作空间和过多环境查询。

Method: SEBA集成影子Q模型估计对抗条件下的累积奖励，使用生成对抗网络产生视觉不可察觉的扰动，并利用世界模型模拟环境动态以减少真实世界查询。通过两阶段迭代训练程序，交替学习影子模型和优化生成器。

Result: 在MuJoCo和Atari基准测试中，SEBA显著降低累积奖励，保持视觉保真度，并大幅减少环境交互次数，优于先前的黑盒和白盒方法。

Conclusion: SEBA提供了一个高效的黑盒对抗攻击框架，能够在视觉强化学习中实现强大的攻击性能，同时保持样本效率和视觉质量。

Abstract: Visual reinforcement learning has achieved remarkable progress in visual control and robotics, but its vulnerability to adversarial perturbations remains underexplored. Most existing black-box attacks focus on vector-based or discrete-action RL, and their effectiveness on image-based continuous control is limited by the large action space and excessive environment queries. We propose SEBA, a sample-efficient framework for black-box adversarial attacks on visual RL agents. SEBA integrates a shadow Q model that estimates cumulative rewards under adversarial conditions, a generative adversarial network that produces visually imperceptible perturbations, and a world model that simulates environment dynamics to reduce real-world queries. Through a two-stage iterative training procedure that alternates between learning the shadow model and refining the generator, SEBA achieves strong attack performance while maintaining efficiency. Experiments on MuJoCo and Atari benchmarks show that SEBA significantly reduces cumulative rewards, preserves visual fidelity, and greatly decreases environment interactions compared to prior black-box and white-box methods.

Conclusion: 提出的约束RL框架为Text2SQL提供了理论保证，并通过实验验证了其相对于现有RL方法的改进效果。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has demonstrated significant promise in enhancing the reasoning capabilities of Text2SQL LLMs, especially with advanced algorithms such as GRPO and DAPO. However, the performance of these methods is highly sensitive to the design of reward functions. Inappropriate rewards can lead to reward hacking, where models exploit loopholes in the reward structure to achieve high scores without genuinely solving the task. This work considers a constrained RL framework for Text2SQL that incorporates natural and interpretable reward and constraint signals, while dynamically balancing trade-offs among them during the training. We establish the theoretical guarantees of our constrained RL framework and our numerical experiments on the well-known Text2SQL datasets substantiate the improvement of our approach over the state-of-the-art RL-trained LLMs.

Motivation: MCR作为二进制散点码模型的泛化，旨在提供更高的表示能力，同时保持轻量级特性，但之前缺乏系统分析，其复杂性被认为超过了表达能力提升的价值。

Method: 对MCR进行首次全面评估，包括容量测量、123个数据集的准确性测试，以及设计首个专用硬件加速器来验证其硬件实现潜力。

Result: MCR在容量上优于二进制和整数向量，接近复数表示但内存占用更少；在123个数据集上显示一致性精度提升，内存使用比二进制散点码减少4倍；硬件加速实现3个数量级速度提升和显著能耗降低。

Conclusion: 尽管MCR需要比二进制散点码更复杂的操作，但其模运算和更高组件精度实现了更低维度，在专用硬件上成为更快、更节能、高精度的替代方案。

Abstract: The modular composite representation (MCR) is a computing model that represents information with high-dimensional integer vectors using modular arithmetic. Originally proposed as a generalization of the binary spatter code model, it aims to provide higher representational power while remaining a lighter alternative to models requiring high-precision components. Despite this potential, MCR has received limited attention. Systematic analyses of its trade-offs and comparisons with other models are lacking, sustaining the perception that its added complexity outweighs the improved expressivity. In this work, we revisit MCR by presenting its first extensive evaluation, demonstrating that it achieves a unique balance of capacity, accuracy, and hardware efficiency. Experiments measuring capacity demonstrate that MCR outperforms binary and integer vectors while approaching complex-valued representations at a fraction of their memory footprint. Evaluation on 123 datasets confirms consistent accuracy gains and shows that MCR can match the performance of binary spatter codes using up to 4x less memory. We investigate the hardware realization of MCR by showing that it maps naturally to digital logic and by designing the first dedicated accelerator. Evaluations on basic operations and 7 selected datasets demonstrate a speedup of up to 3 orders of magnitude and significant energy reductions compared to software implementation. When matched for accuracy against binary spatter codes, MCR achieves on average 3.08x faster execution and 2.68x lower energy consumption. These findings demonstrate that, although MCR requires more sophisticated operations than binary spatter codes, its modular arithmetic and higher per-component precision enable lower dimensionality. When realized with dedicated hardware, this results in a faster, more energy-efficient, and high-precision alternative to existing models.

Deep learning-based surrogate models typically specialize in a single PDE with fixed parameters. We present a framework for equation-aware emulation that generalizes to unseen PDEs, conditioning a neural model on a vector encoding representing the terms in a PDE and their coefficients. We present a baseline of four distinct modeling technqiues, trained on a family of 1D PDEs from the APEBench suite. Our approach achieves strong performance on parameter sets held out from the training distribution, with strong stability for rollout beyond the training window, and generalization to an entirely unseen PDE. This work was developed as part of a broader effort exploring AI systems that automate the creation of expert-level empirical software for scorable scientific tasks.

*Bernardo Perrone Ribeiro,Jana Faganeli Pucer*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FlowCast是首个将条件流匹配应用于降水临近预报的模型，相比扩散模型实现了更快速、高保真的样本生成，在预测准确性上达到新SOTA。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决雷达降水临近预报中的两个关键挑战：大气动力学的不确定性和高维数据的高效建模，同时克服扩散模型迭代采样过程计算成本高的问题。

Method: 采用条件流匹配方法，学习从噪声到数据的直接映射，相比扩散模型需要更少的函数评估次数。

Result: 实验表明FlowCast在预测准确性上达到新的最先进水平，CFM目标比相同架构下的扩散目标更准确且效率显著更高，在更少采样步数下保持高性能。

Conclusion: 条件流匹配是高维时空预报中强大且实用的替代方案。

Abstract: Radar-based precipitation nowcasting, the task of forecasting short-term precipitation fields from previous radar images, is a critical problem for flood risk management and decision-making. While deep learning has substantially advanced this field, two challenges remain fundamental: the uncertainty of atmospheric dynamics and the efficient modeling of high-dimensional data. Diffusion models have shown strong promise by producing sharp, reliable forecasts, but their iterative sampling process is computationally prohibitive for time-critical applications. We introduce FlowCast, the first model to apply Conditional Flow Matching (CFM) to precipitation nowcasting. Unlike diffusion, CFM learns a direct noise-to-data mapping, enabling rapid, high-fidelity sample generation with drastically fewer function evaluations. Our experiments demonstrate that FlowCast establishes a new state-of-the-art in predictive accuracy. A direct comparison further reveals the CFM objective is both more accurate and significantly more efficient than a diffusion objective on the same architecture, maintaining high performance with significantly fewer sampling steps. This work positions CFM as a powerful and practical alternative for high-dimensional spatiotemporal forecasting.

TL;DR: 本文研究了分裂联邦学习(SFL)中的数据异构性导致的灾难性遗忘问题，提出了Hydra方法来缓解这一问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在分裂联邦学习中，由于数据异构性，本地模型更新会偏离全局最优解，而服务器端的模型部分对处理顺序敏感，类似于持续学习中的遗忘现象，导致模型在序列末尾看到的类别上表现更好。

Method: 提出了Hydra方法，受多头神经网络启发并适应SFL设置，通过多头部设计来缓解灾难性遗忘问题。

Result: 广泛的数值评估表明，Hydra方法在性能上优于基线方法和文献中的现有方法。

Conclusion: Hydra方法能有效缓解分裂联邦学习中的灾难性遗忘问题，提升模型在异构数据环境下的性能表现。

Abstract: In Split Federated Learning (SFL), the clients collaboratively train a model with the help of a server by splitting the model into two parts. Part-1 is trained locally at each client and aggregated by the aggregator at the end of each round. Part-2 is trained at a server that sequentially processes the intermediate activations received from each client. We study the phenomenon of catastrophic forgetting (CF) in SFL in the presence of data heterogeneity. In detail, due to the nature of SFL, local updates of part-1 may drift away from global optima, while part-2 is sensitive to the processing sequence, similar to forgetting in continual learning (CL). Specifically, we observe that the trained model performs better in classes (labels) seen at the end of the sequence. We investigate this phenomenon with emphasis on key aspects of SFL, such as the processing order at the server and the cut layer. Based on our findings, we propose Hydra, a novel mitigation method inspired by multi-head neural networks and adapted for the SFL's setting. Extensive numerical evaluations show that Hydra outperforms baselines and methods from the literature.

TL;DR: SPARC是一种用于强化学习的单阶段适应方法，旨在解决机器人在未见环境中的泛化问题，特别是在没有显式上下文信息的情况下实现OOD泛化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决机器人在不同环境上下文（如不同地形、天气条件）中的泛化挑战，特别是在测试时无法获取显式上下文信息的情况下实现OOD泛化。

Method: 提出SPARC：单阶段适应鲁棒控制方法，简化了之前需要分别训练上下文编码器和历史适应模块的两阶段方法。

Result: 在Gran Turismo 7赛车模拟器和风扰动MuJoCo环境中测试，SPARC实现了可靠且鲁棒的OOD泛化性能。

Conclusion: SPARC简化了训练流程，在保持性能的同时实现了有效的OOD泛化，为机器人控制提供了更实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Generalization to unseen environments is a significant challenge in the field of robotics and control. In this work, we focus on contextual reinforcement learning, where agents act within environments with varying contexts, such as self-driving cars or quadrupedal robots that need to operate in different terrains or weather conditions than they were trained for. We tackle the critical task of generalizing to out-of-distribution (OOD) settings, without access to explicit context information at test time. Recent work has addressed this problem by training a context encoder and a history adaptation module in separate stages. While promising, this two-phase approach is cumbersome to implement and train. We simplify the methodology and introduce SPARC: single-phase adaptation for robust control. We test SPARC on varying contexts within the high-fidelity racing simulator Gran Turismo 7 and wind-perturbed MuJoCo environments, and find that it achieves reliable and robust OOD generalization.

*Sarthak Khanna,Armin Berger,Muskaan Chopra,Rafet Sifa*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一个基于宏观经济情境检索的金融预测框架，通过检索历史上相似的宏观经济环境来增强预测的稳健性，在分布外测试中显著优于传统多模态方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 金融市场具有非平稳性，结构性断裂和宏观经济体制转换导致传统预测模型在分布外部署时失效。现有融合数值指标和文本情感的多模态方法难以适应这种变化。

Method: 引入宏观情境检索框架，在共享相似性空间中联合嵌入宏观指标（CPI、失业率、收益率利差、GDP增长等）和金融新闻情感，在推理时无需重新训练即可因果检索历史相似时期。

Result: 在17年标普500数据上训练，在AAPL和XOM的2024年分布外测试中，该框架显著缩小了CV到OOD性能差距，实现了唯一正的样本外交易结果（AAPL：PF=1.18，Sharpe=0.95；XOM：PF=1.16，Sharpe=0.61）。

Conclusion: 通过实施"金融历史不会重演但会押韵"的原则，证明基于宏观意识的检索能够在分布变化下产生稳健、可解释的预测，检索到的邻居形成可解释的证据链，对应可识别的宏观情境。

Abstract: Financial markets are inherently non-stationary: structural breaks and macroeconomic regime shifts often cause forecasting models to fail when deployed out of distribution (OOD). Conventional multimodal approaches that simply fuse numerical indicators and textual sentiment rarely adapt to such shifts. We introduce macro-contextual retrieval, a retrieval-augmented forecasting framework that grounds each prediction in historically analogous macroeconomic regimes. The method jointly embeds macro indicators (e.g., CPI, unemployment, yield spread, GDP growth) and financial news sentiment in a shared similarity space, enabling causal retrieval of precedent periods during inference without retraining.
  Trained on seventeen years of S&P 500 data (2007-2023) and evaluated OOD on AAPL (2024) and XOM (2024), the framework consistently narrows the CV to OOD performance gap. Macro-conditioned retrieval achieves the only positive out-of-sample trading outcomes (AAPL: PF=1.18, Sharpe=0.95; XOM: PF=1.16, Sharpe=0.61), while static numeric, text-only, and naive multimodal baselines collapse under regime shifts. Beyond metric gains, retrieved neighbors form interpretable evidence chains that correspond to recognizable macro contexts, such as inflationary or yield-curve inversion phases, supporting causal interpretability and transparency. By operationalizing the principle that "financial history may not repeat, but it often rhymes," this work demonstrates that macro-aware retrieval yields robust, explainable forecasts under distributional change.
  All datasets, models, and source code are publicly available.

TL;DR: 本文研究了在恶意噪声和恶意噪声两种对抗性噪声模型下，高效学习算法的能力和局限性。主要发现在分布无关学习和固定分布学习之间存在显著差异：分布无关学习中两种噪声模型等价，而固定分布学习中存在任意大的分离。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究在对抗性噪声环境下高效学习算法的能力，特别是比较恶意噪声和恶意噪声两种重要噪声模型对学习性能的影响。

Method: 通过理论分析和证明，比较了分布无关学习和固定分布学习两种设置下，恶意噪声和恶意噪声的等价性和分离性。定义了忽略矛盾示例（ICE）算法类，并分析了其在不同噪声模型下的性能。

Result: 1. 分布无关学习中，恶意噪声和恶意噪声是等价的；2. 固定分布学习中，两种噪声模型存在任意大的分离；3. ICE算法在两种噪声模型下性能差异最多为2倍。

Conclusion: 学习设置（分布无关vs固定分布）对噪声容忍度有决定性影响，ICE算法为固定分布学习提供了实用的噪声鲁棒性保证。

Abstract: We consider the relative abilities and limitations of computationally efficient algorithms for learning in the presence of noise, under two well-studied and challenging adversarial noise models for learning Boolean functions: malicious noise, in which an adversary can arbitrarily corrupt a random subset of examples given to the learner; and nasty noise, in which an adversary can arbitrarily corrupt an adversarially chosen subset of examples given to the learner.
  We consider both the distribution-independent and fixed-distribution settings. Our main results highlight a dramatic difference between these two settings: For distribution-independent learning, we prove a strong equivalence between the two noise models: If a class ${\cal C}$ of functions is efficiently learnable in the presence of $η$-rate malicious noise, then it is also efficiently learnable in the presence of $η$-rate nasty noise. In sharp contrast, for the fixed-distribution setting we show an arbitrarily large separation: Under a standard cryptographic assumption, for any arbitrarily large value $r$ there exists a concept class for which there is a ratio of $r$ between the rate $η_{malicious}$ of malicious noise that polynomial-time learning algorithms can tolerate, versus the rate $η_{nasty}$ of nasty noise that such learning algorithms can tolerate.
  To offset the negative result for the fixed-distribution setting, we define a broad and natural class of algorithms, namely those that ignore contradictory examples (ICE). We show that for these algorithms, malicious noise and nasty noise are equivalent up to a factor of two in the noise rate: Any efficient ICE learner that succeeds with $η$-rate malicious noise can be converted to an efficient learner that succeeds with $η/2$-rate nasty noise. We further show that the above factor of two is necessary, again under a standard cryptographic assumption.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: NeuroLingua是一个受语言启发的睡眠分期框架，将睡眠视为结构化生理语言，通过双级Transformer和GCN多模态融合，在Sleep-EDF和ISRUC数据集上达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前自动睡眠分期存在三个主要限制：缺乏表达性时间层次结构、多模态EEG和EOG融合的挑战、深度学习模型可解释性有限。

Method: 将30秒epoch分解为3秒子窗口（"tokens"），使用CNN分词器，通过双级Transformer进行层次时间建模（局部依赖和3.5分钟扩展上下文），EEG和EOG通道通过图卷积网络进行多模态融合。

Result: 在Sleep-EDF数据集上达到85.3%准确率、0.800宏F1和0.796 Cohen's kappa；在ISRUC数据集上达到81.9%准确率、0.802宏F1和0.755 kappa，匹配或超过已发表基线。

Conclusion: 通过将睡眠框架化为组合语言，NeuroLingua统一了层次序列建模和多模态融合，为睡眠研究中的可解释性、可解释性和因果推理提供了原则性基础。

Abstract: Automated sleep stage classification from polysomnography remains limited by the lack of expressive temporal hierarchies, challenges in multimodal EEG and EOG fusion, and the limited interpretability of deep learning models. We propose NeuroLingua, a language-inspired framework that conceptualizes sleep as a structured physiological language. Each 30-second epoch is decomposed into overlapping 3-second subwindows ("tokens") using a CNN-based tokenizer, enabling hierarchical temporal modeling through dual-level Transformers: intra-segment encoding of local dependencies and inter-segment integration across seven consecutive epochs (3.5 minutes) for extended context. Modality-specific embeddings from EEG and EOG channels are fused via a Graph Convolutional Network, facilitating robust multimodal integration. NeuroLingua is evaluated on the Sleep-EDF Expanded and ISRUC-Sleep datasets, achieving state-of-the-art results on Sleep-EDF (85.3% accuracy, 0.800 macro F1, and 0.796 Cohen's kappa) and competitive performance on ISRUC (81.9% accuracy, 0.802 macro F1, and 0.755 kappa), matching or exceeding published baselines in overall and per-class metrics. The architecture's attention mechanisms enhance the detection of clinically relevant sleep microevents, providing a principled foundation for future interpretability, explainability, and causal inference in sleep research. By framing sleep as a compositional language, NeuroLingua unifies hierarchical sequence modeling and multimodal fusion, advancing automated sleep staging toward more transparent and clinically meaningful applications.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了针对去中心化GRPO训练的首个对抗性攻击，展示了恶意方可以通过注入恶意token来毒化良性模型，攻击成功率可达100%，并提出了两种防御方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GRPO在LLM后训练中应用广泛，其去中心化特性虽然适合多节点并发训练，但也为对抗性攻击提供了可乘之机，需要研究相应的安全威胁和防御措施。

Method: 通过在去中心化GRPO训练中注入任意恶意token，实现上下文内和上下文外攻击，使用数学和编程任务的实证例子验证攻击效果。

Result: 对抗性攻击可以轻松毒化良性节点，污染其本地LLM后训练，在仅50次迭代内攻击成功率可达100%。

Conclusion: 提出了两种防御方法（针对相同模型和不同模型训练场景），防御成功率可达100%，能够有效阻止此类攻击。

Abstract: Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) has demonstrated great utilization in post-training of Large Language Models (LLMs). In GRPO, prompts are answered by the model and, through reinforcement learning, preferred completions are learnt. Owing to the small communication volume, GRPO is inherently suitable for decentralised training as the prompts can be concurrently answered by multiple nodes and then exchanged in the forms of strings. In this work, we present the first adversarial attack in decentralised GRPO. We demonstrate that malicious parties can poison such systems by injecting arbitrary malicious tokens in benign models in both out-of-context and in-context attacks. Using empirical examples of math and coding tasks, we show that adversarial attacks can easily poison the benign nodes, polluting their local LLM post-training, achieving attack success rates up to 100% in as few as 50 iterations. We propose two ways to defend against these attacks, depending on whether all users train the same model or different models. We show that these defenses can achieve stop rates of up to 100%, making the attack impossible.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解释JEPAs为何能够自动聚类时间序列数据的动力学机制，这一现象目前缺乏理论解释。

Method: 提出理论假设：JEPA的预测目标隐式驱动其学习系统Koopman算子的不变子空间；在已知动力学的合成数据上验证理论；约束线性预测器为近似恒等算子作为关键归纳偏置。

Result: 证明理想化JEPA损失在编码器表示系统机制指示函数（Koopman特征函数）时最小化；验证约束预测器为近恒等算子是迫使编码器学习不变量的关键。

Conclusion: 揭示了JEPAs关键行为机制，建立了现代自监督学习与动力系统理论的原理性联系，为设计更鲁棒可解释的时间序列模型提供指导。

Abstract: Joint-Embedding Predictive Architectures (JEPAs), a powerful class of self-supervised models, exhibit an unexplained ability to cluster time-series data by their underlying dynamical regimes. We propose a novel theoretical explanation for this phenomenon, hypothesizing that JEPA's predictive objective implicitly drives it to learn the invariant subspace of the system's Koopman operator. We prove that an idealized JEPA loss is minimized when the encoder represents the system's regime indicator functions, which are Koopman eigenfunctions. This theory was validated on synthetic data with known dynamics, demonstrating that constraining the JEPA's linear predictor to be a near-identity operator is the key inductive bias that forces the encoder to learn these invariants. We further discuss that this constraint is critical for selecting this interpretable solution from a class of mathematically equivalent but entangled optima, revealing the predictor's role in representation disentanglement. This work demystifies a key behavior of JEPAs, provides a principled connection between modern self-supervised learning and dynamical systems theory, and informs the design of more robust and interpretable time-series models.

Conclusion: CaReTS框架成功地将分类和回归任务结合，不仅提高了预测精度，还提供了更可解释的时间动态分析。

Abstract: Recent advances in deep forecasting models have achieved remarkable performance, yet most approaches still struggle to provide both accurate predictions and interpretable insights into temporal dynamics. This paper proposes CaReTS, a novel multi-task learning framework that combines classification and regression tasks for multi-step time series forecasting problems. The framework adopts a dual-stream architecture, where a classification branch learns the stepwise trend into the future, while a regression branch estimates the corresponding deviations from the latest observation of the target variable. The dual-stream design provides more interpretable predictions by disentangling macro-level trends from micro-level deviations in the target variable. To enable effective learning in output prediction, deviation estimation, and trend classification, we design a multi-task loss with uncertainty-aware weighting to adaptively balance the contribution of each task. Furthermore, four variants (CaReTS1--4) are instantiated under this framework to incorporate mainstream temporal modelling encoders, including convolutional neural networks (CNNs), long short-term memory networks (LSTMs), and Transformers. Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that CaReTS outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) algorithms in forecasting accuracy, while achieving higher trend classification performance.

Conclusion: 无需单调性约束，非单调值分解能够自然收敛到IGM一致解，为未来基于值的MARL算法设计提供了重要见解。

Abstract: Value decomposition is a central approach in multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL), enabling centralized training with decentralized execution by factorizing the global value function into local values. To ensure individual-global-max (IGM) consistency, existing methods either enforce monotonicity constraints, which limit expressive power, or adopt softer surrogates at the cost of algorithmic complexity. In this work, we present a dynamical systems analysis of non-monotonic value decomposition, modeling learning dynamics as continuous-time gradient flow. We prove that, under approximately greedy exploration, all zero-loss equilibria violating IGM consistency are unstable saddle points, while only IGM-consistent solutions are stable attractors of the learning dynamics. Extensive experiments on both synthetic matrix games and challenging MARL benchmarks demonstrate that unconstrained, non-monotonic factorization reliably recovers IGM-optimal solutions and consistently outperforms monotonic baselines. Additionally, we investigate the influence of temporal-difference targets and exploration strategies, providing actionable insights for the design of future value-based MARL algorithms.

TL;DR: 本文研究了具有可行性约束的最佳臂识别问题，提出了一种高效的算法，该算法能自适应地选择测试臂的性能或可行性约束，并在固定置信度设置下实现渐进最优的样本复杂度。

Motivation: 现实世界中的最佳臂识别问题通常需要满足额外的可行性约束，且性能测量和可行性测试往往可以分开进行。现有方法假设两者同时观测，这与实际应用不符，如药物发现中需要分别测试药效和安全性。

Method: 提出了一种算法，允许决策者在每次选择时决定测试臂的性能（ℓ=0）或任一可行性约束（ℓ∈[N]），通过自适应地消除性能较差或不可行的臂来减少样本复杂度。

Result: 理论分析给出了算法的样本复杂度上界，证明其能自然适应问题难度，并通过下界证明算法在δ→0时是渐进最优的。实验表明该算法在合成和真实数据集上优于现有BAI算法。

Conclusion: 该工作为具有可行性约束的最佳臂识别问题提供了一种高效且渐进最优的解决方案，特别适用于性能测量和可行性测试可以分开进行的实际应用场景。

Abstract: Best arm identification (BAI) aims to identify the highest-performance arm among a set of $K$ arms by collecting stochastic samples from each arm. In real-world problems, the best arm needs to satisfy additional feasibility constraints. While there is limited prior work on BAI with feasibility constraints, they typically assume the performance and constraints are observed simultaneously on each pull of an arm. However, this assumption does not reflect most practical use cases, e.g., in drug discovery, we wish to find the most potent drug whose toxicity and solubility are below certain safety thresholds. These safety experiments can be conducted separately from the potency measurement. Thus, this requires designing BAI algorithms that not only decide which arm to pull but also decide whether to test for the arm's performance or feasibility. In this work, we study feasible BAI which allows a decision-maker to choose a tuple $(i,\ell)$, where $i\in [K]$ denotes an arm and $\ell$ denotes whether she wishes to test for its performance ($\ell=0$) or any of its $N$ feasibility constraints ($\ell\in[N]$). We focus on the fixed confidence setting, which is to identify the \textit{feasible} arm with the \textit{highest performance}, with a probability of at least $1-δ$. We propose an efficient algorithm and upper-bound its sample complexity, showing our algorithm can naturally adapt to the problem's difficulty and eliminate arms by worse performance or infeasibility, whichever is easier. We complement this upper bound with a lower bound showing that our algorithm is \textit{asymptotically ($δ\rightarrow 0$) optimal}. Finally, we empirically show that our algorithm outperforms other state-of-the-art BAI algorithms in both synthetic and real-world datasets.

Abstract: This paper investigates how the compositional structure of neural networks shapes their optimization landscape and training dynamics. We analyze the gradient flow associated with overparameterized optimization problems, which can be interpreted as training a neural network with linear activations. Remarkably, we show that the global convergence properties can be derived for any cost function that is proper and real analytic. We then specialize the analysis to scalar-valued cost functions, where the geometry of the landscape can be fully characterized. In this setting, we demonstrate that key structural features -- such as the location and stability of saddle points -- are universal across all admissible costs, depending solely on the overparameterized representation rather than on problem-specific details. Moreover, we show that convergence can be arbitrarily accelerated depending on the initialization, as measured by an imbalance metric introduced in this work. Finally, we discuss how these insights may generalize to neural networks with sigmoidal activations, showing through a simple example which geometric and dynamical properties persist beyond the linear case.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新算法，能够在满足因子化假设的分布下，以多项式时间学习两个半空间的交集，突破了之前CSQ方法的准多项式时间下界。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 学习半空间交集是计算学习理论的核心问题。即使只有两个半空间，能否在多项式时间内学习仍然是一个重要的开放性问题。已知的算法需要准多项式时间d^O(log(1/γ))，且CSQ方法无法避免这种复杂度。

Method: 采用新的对偶框架分析边际分布诱导的矩张量结构，结合Jennrich算法的改进版本、随机投影下的PCA以及基于梯度下降的非凸优化框架。

Result: 在因子化分布下，CSQ方法仍需准多项式时间，而我们的SQ算法能在poly(d,1/γ)时间内完成学习，建立了CSQ与SQ之间的强分离。

Conclusion: 该工作证明了在因子化分布假设下，通过利用更一般的统计查询(SQ)，可以突破CSQ方法的计算障碍，为半空间交集学习提供了高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Learning intersections of halfspaces is a central problem in Computational Learning Theory. Even for just two halfspaces, it remains a major open question whether learning is possible in polynomial time with respect to the margin $γ$ of the data points and their dimensionality $d$. The best-known algorithms run in quasi-polynomial time $d^{O(\log(1/γ))}$, and it has been shown that this complexity is unavoidable for any algorithm relying solely on correlational statistical queries (CSQ).
  In this work, we introduce a novel algorithm that provably circumvents the CSQ hardness barrier. Our approach applies to a broad class of distributions satisfying a natural, previously studied, factorizability assumption. Factorizable distributions lie between distribution-specific and distribution-free settings, and significantly extend previously known tractable cases. Under these distributions, we show that CSQ-based methods still require quasipolynomial time even for weakly learning, whereas our algorithm achieves $poly(d,1/γ)$ time by leveraging more general statistical queries (SQ), establishing a strong separation between CSQ and SQ for this simple realizable PAC learning problem.
  Our result is grounded in a rigorous analysis utilizing a novel duality framework that characterizes the moment tensor structure induced by the marginal distributions. Building on these structural insights, we propose new, efficient learning algorithms. These algorithms combine a refined variant of Jennrich's Algorithm with PCA over random projections of the moment tensor, along with a gradient-descent-based non-convex optimization framework.

TL;DR: ACT数据管道使用LLM作为标注者和错误检测者，通过让人类只审查可疑案例，在保持标注质量的同时显著提升人工标注效率，在多数基准数据集上性能差距小于2%，节省90%人工成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决监督学习依赖高质量标注数据但人工标注成本高、耗时长的问题，以及现有LLM标注方法质量仍不及人类水平的问题。

Method: 提出ACT数据管道，让LLM既作为标注者又作为判断者来识别潜在错误，人类只需审查最可疑的案例，从而提高标注效率。

Result: 实验表明，在大多数基准数据集上，使用ACT数据训练的模型与完全人工标注数据训练的模型性能差距小于2%，同时节省高达90%的人工成本。

Conclusion: ACT方法有效提升了标注效率，在保持标注质量的同时大幅降低了人工成本，适用于NLP、CV和多模态理解等多个领域。

Abstract: Supervised learning relies on high-quality labeled data, but obtaining such data through human annotation is both expensive and time-consuming. Recent work explores using large language models (LLMs) for annotation, but LLM-generated labels still fall short of human-level quality. To address this problem, we propose the Annotation with Critical Thinking (ACT) data pipeline, where LLMs serve not only as annotators but also as judges to critically identify potential errors. Human effort is then directed towards reviewing only the most "suspicious" cases, significantly improving the human annotation efficiency. Our major contributions are as follows: (1) ACT is applicable to a wide range of domains, including natural language processing (NLP), computer vision (CV), and multimodal understanding, by leveraging multimodal-LLMs (MLLMs). (2) Through empirical studies, we derive 7 insights on how to enhance annotation quality while efficiently reducing the human cost, and then translate these findings into user-friendly guidelines. (3) We theoretically analyze how to modify the loss function so that models trained on ACT data achieve similar performance to those trained on fully human-annotated data. Our experiments show that the performance gap can be reduced to less than 2% on most benchmark datasets while saving up to 90% of human costs.

TL;DR: ConSurv是首个用于生存分析的多模态持续学习方法，通过MS-MoE和FCR组件解决灾难性遗忘和模态间复杂交互问题，在MSAIL基准测试中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 静态模型无法适应动态变化的临床环境和连续数据流，现有持续学习方法主要关注单模态输入且在生存预测中存在严重灾难性遗忘，多模态输入提供更全面的信息但现有方法忽视了模态间相关性。

Method: 提出ConSurv方法，包含两个关键组件：多阶段专家混合(MS-MoE)捕获网络不同学习阶段的任务共享和特定知识，学习模态间关系；特征约束回放(FCR)通过限制先前数据在不同层次的特征偏差来增强学习知识并减轻遗忘。

Result: 在综合评估的持续学习设置中，ConSurv在多个指标上优于竞争方法。

Conclusion: ConSurv成功解决了多模态生存分析中的灾难性遗忘和复杂模态交互问题，为动态临床环境中的生存预测提供了有效的持续学习解决方案。

Abstract: Survival prediction of cancers is crucial for clinical practice, as it informs mortality risks and influences treatment plans. However, a static model trained on a single dataset fails to adapt to the dynamically evolving clinical environment and continuous data streams, limiting its practical utility. While continual learning (CL) offers a solution to learn dynamically from new datasets, existing CL methods primarily focus on unimodal inputs and suffer from severe catastrophic forgetting in survival prediction. In real-world scenarios, multimodal inputs often provide comprehensive and complementary information, such as whole slide images and genomics; and neglecting inter-modal correlations negatively impacts the performance. To address the two challenges of catastrophic forgetting and complex inter-modal interactions between gigapixel whole slide images and genomics, we propose ConSurv, the first multimodal continual learning (MMCL) method for survival analysis. ConSurv incorporates two key components: Multi-staged Mixture of Experts (MS-MoE) and Feature Constrained Replay (FCR). MS-MoE captures both task-shared and task-specific knowledge at different learning stages of the network, including two modality encoders and the modality fusion component, learning inter-modal relationships. FCR further enhances learned knowledge and mitigates forgetting by restricting feature deviation of previous data at different levels, including encoder-level features of two modalities and the fusion-level representations. Additionally, we introduce a new benchmark integrating four datasets, Multimodal Survival Analysis Incremental Learning (MSAIL), for comprehensive evaluation in the CL setting. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ConSurv outperforms competing methods across multiple metrics.

Conclusion: 通过整合技术和组织视角，本研究为构建能够按要求遗忘、同时维护隐私和公众信任的AI系统指明了路径。

Abstract: The growing use of large language models in sensitive domains has exposed a critical weakness: the inability to ensure that private information can be permanently forgotten. Yet these systems still lack reliable mechanisms to guarantee that sensitive information can be permanently removed once it has been used. Retraining from the beginning is prohibitively costly, and existing unlearning methods remain fragmented, difficult to verify, and often vulnerable to recovery. This paper surveys recent research on machine unlearning for LLMs and considers how far current approaches can address these challenges. We review methods for evaluating whether forgetting has occurred, the resilience of unlearned models against adversarial attacks, and mechanisms that can support user trust when model complexity or proprietary limits restrict transparency. Technical solutions such as differential privacy, homomorphic encryption, federated learning, and ephemeral memory are examined alongside institutional safeguards including auditing practices and regulatory frameworks. The review finds steady progress, but robust and verifiable unlearning is still unresolved. Efficient techniques that avoid costly retraining, stronger defenses against adversarial recovery, and governance structures that reinforce accountability are needed if LLMs are to be deployed safely in sensitive applications. By integrating technical and organizational perspectives, this study outlines a pathway toward AI systems that can be required to forget, while maintaining both privacy and public trust.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于不确定性的检查点选择方法(UGCS)，通过识别困难样本的预测不确定性来筛选最佳模型检查点，避免传统方法的高计算成本和不稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 强化学习微调过程中模型检查点选择困难，传统方法要么计算成本高（验证集评估），要么缺乏性能保证（仅用最终检查点），需要一种更稳定高效的选择策略。

Method: 使用基于不确定性的检查点选择方法，识别困难问答对的样本级不确定性，通过评估检查点在最具挑战性样本上的表现来排名，采用短训练窗口内高不确定性样本奖励的平均值作为选择信号。

Result: 在三个数据集和三个大语言模型上的实验表明，该方法能一致性地识别出具有更强泛化能力的检查点，优于依赖训练或验证性能的传统策略。

Conclusion: 能够以低不确定性解决最困难任务的模型是最可靠的，基于不确定性的检查点选择方法提供了一种稳定且有效的模型选择策略。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) finetuning is crucial to aligning large language models (LLMs), but the process is notoriously unstable and exhibits high variance across model checkpoints. In practice, selecting the best checkpoint is challenging: evaluating checkpoints on the validation set during training is computationally expensive and requires a good validation set, while relying on the final checkpoint provides no guarantee of good performance. We introduce an uncertainty-guided approach for checkpoint selection (UGCS) that avoids these pitfalls. Our method identifies hard question-answer pairs using per-sample uncertainty and ranks checkpoints by how well they handle these challenging cases. By averaging the rewards of the top-uncertain samples over a short training window, our method produces a stable and discriminative signal without additional forward passes or significant computation overhead. Experiments across three datasets and three LLMs demonstrate that it consistently identifies checkpoints with stronger generalization, outperforming traditional strategies such as relying on training or validation performance. These results highlight that models solving their hardest tasks with low uncertainty are the most reliable overall.

TL;DR: 提出了一种可扩展的双记忆持续学习方法，通过共享特征记忆和样本特定特征记忆的互补机制，结合自适应剪枝和正交正则化，有效解决传统方法中任务隔离导致的重复学习和特征过度分化问题。


<details>

Method: 使用两个可微分记忆：一个学习跨任务通用特征，另一个结合共享特征学习每个样本的判别性特征。通过内存调整模块自适应剪枝关键槽位并最小化扩展容量，正交正则化确保保留和新学习记忆组件间的几何分离。

Result: 在CIFAR-10、CIFAR-100和Tiny-ImageNet上超越14种最先进方法，分别达到55.13%、37.24%和30.11%的最终准确率。

Conclusion: 该方法通过有效整合和利用知识，提高了顺序任务的平均性能，产生的特征提取结果最接近理论上限，为持续学习设立了新的里程碑。

Abstract: Continual learning methods used to force neural networks to process sequential tasks in isolation, preventing them from leveraging useful inter-task relationships and causing them to repeatedly relearn similar features or overly differentiate them. To address this problem, we propose a fully differentiable, exemplar-free expandable method composed of two complementary memories: One learns common features that can be used across all tasks, and the other combines the shared features to learn discriminative characteristics unique to each sample. Both memories are differentiable so that the network can autonomously learn latent representations for each sample. For each task, the memory adjustment module adaptively prunes critical slots and minimally expands capacity to accommodate new concepts, and orthogonal regularization enforces geometric separation between preserved and newly learned memory components to prevent interference. Experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Tiny-ImageNet show that the proposed method outperforms 14 state-of-the-art methods for class-incremental learning, achieving final accuracies of 55.13\%, 37.24\%, and 30.11\%, respectively. Additional analysis confirms that, through effective integration and utilization of knowledge, the proposed method can increase average performance across sequential tasks, and it produces feature extraction results closest to the upper bound, thus establishing a new milestone in continual learning.

TL;DR: 提出了Anchor-based Fair Clustering Framework (AFCF)，一个线性时间可扩展的公平聚类框架，通过锚点选择和标签传播显著加速现有公平聚类算法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有公平聚类算法通常具有二次或超二次计算复杂度，无法处理大规模数据集，需要开发高效的解决方案。

Method: 使用公平采样策略选择代表性锚点，在锚点上应用现成公平聚类算法，然后通过优化问题构建锚点图传播标签，保持公平性约束。

Result: 在多个大规模基准测试中，AFCF将计算时间减少数个数量级，同时保持强大的聚类性能和公平性保证。

Conclusion: AFCF是一个通用、即插即用的框架，能够使任意公平聚类算法实现线性时间可扩展性，解决了大规模公平聚类的计算瓶颈问题。

Abstract: Fair clustering is crucial for mitigating bias in unsupervised learning, yet existing algorithms often suffer from quadratic or super-quadratic computational complexity, rendering them impractical for large-scale datasets. To bridge this gap, we introduce the Anchor-based Fair Clustering Framework (AFCF), a novel, general, and plug-and-play framework that empowers arbitrary fair clustering algorithms with linear-time scalability. Our approach first selects a small but representative set of anchors using a novel fair sampling strategy. Then, any off-the-shelf fair clustering algorithm can be applied to this small anchor set. The core of our framework lies in a novel anchor graph construction module, where we formulate an optimization problem to propagate labels while preserving fairness. This is achieved through a carefully designed group-label joint constraint, which we prove theoretically ensures that the fairness of the final clustering on the entire dataset matches that of the anchor clustering. We solve this optimization efficiently using an ADMM-based algorithm. Extensive experiments on multiple large-scale benchmarks demonstrate that AFCF drastically accelerates state-of-the-art methods, which reduces computational time by orders of magnitude while maintaining strong clustering performance and fairness guarantees.

TL;DR: SE-Diff是一种新颖的生理模拟器和经验增强的扩散模型，用于生成心电图(ECG)。它通过整合ODE基础ECG模拟器和LLM驱动的经验检索策略，解决了现有方法忽视生理模拟知识和临床经验知识的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 心血管疾病是全球主要死亡原因，但大型、标注良好的ECG数据集稀缺。生成ECG有助于理解心脏电活动机制、构建大型数据集并促进隐私保护的数据共享。现有方法忽视了生理模拟知识和临床经验知识。

Method: SE-Diff将轻量级ODE基础ECG模拟器通过节拍解码器和模拟器一致性约束集成到扩散过程中，注入机制先验。同时设计LLM驱动的经验检索增强策略来注入临床知识。

Result: 在真实ECG数据集上的广泛实验表明，SE-Diff在信号保真度和文本-ECG语义对齐方面优于基线方法，证明了其在文本到ECG生成方面的优越性。

Conclusion: 基于模拟器和经验的知识也有利于下游ECG分类任务，SE-Diff为ECG生成提供了一种全面有效的方法。

Abstract: Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a leading cause of mortality worldwide. Electrocardiograms (ECGs) are the most widely used non-invasive tool for cardiac assessment, yet large, well-annotated ECG corpora are scarce due to cost, privacy, and workflow constraints. Generating ECGs can be beneficial for the mechanistic understanding of cardiac electrical activity, enable the construction of large, heterogeneous, and unbiased datasets, and facilitate privacy-preserving data sharing. Generating realistic ECG signals from clinical context is important yet underexplored. Recent work has leveraged diffusion models for text-to-ECG generation, but two challenges remain: (i) existing methods often overlook the physiological simulator knowledge of cardiac activity; and (ii) they ignore broader, experience-based clinical knowledge grounded in real-world practice. To address these gaps, we propose SE-Diff, a novel physiological simulator and experience enhanced diffusion model for comprehensive ECG generation. SE-Diff integrates a lightweight ordinary differential equation (ODE)-based ECG simulator into the diffusion process via a beat decoder and simulator-consistent constraints, injecting mechanistic priors that promote physiologically plausible waveforms. In parallel, we design an LLM-powered experience retrieval-augmented strategy to inject clinical knowledge, providing more guidance for ECG generation. Extensive experiments on real-world ECG datasets demonstrate that SE-Diff improves both signal fidelity and text-ECG semantic alignment over baselines, proving its superiority for text-to-ECG generation. We further show that the simulator-based and experience-based knowledge also benefit downstream ECG classification.

TL;DR: 本文提出SWaST机制，通过交替进行权重剪枝和核心集选择来协同优化深度神经网络，解决大规模模型权重和训练样本带来的计算成本问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代深度神经网络依赖大量模型权重和训练样本，计算成本高昂。权重剪枝和核心集选择是两种提高计算效率的新兴范式，但现有方法往往独立开发，未能充分利用它们之间的协同效应。

Method: 开发了同时权重和样本裁剪机制(SWaST)，交替执行权重剪枝和核心集选择。为避免关键双损失现象，集成了状态保持机制以实现稳定的联合优化。

Result: 实验显示剪枝和核心集选择之间存在强协同效应，在10%到90%的FLOPs减少下，准确率最高提升17.83%。

Conclusion: 权重剪枝和核心集选择可以协同工作，通过SWaST机制实现计算效率的显著提升，同时保持甚至提高模型准确性。

Abstract: Modern deep neural networks rely heavily on massive model weights and training samples, incurring substantial computational costs. Weight pruning and coreset selection are two emerging paradigms proposed to improve computational efficiency. In this paper, we first explore the interplay between redundant weights and training samples through a transparent analysis: redundant samples, particularly noisy ones, cause model weights to become unnecessarily overtuned to fit them, complicating the identification of irrelevant weights during pruning; conversely, irrelevant weights tend to overfit noisy data, undermining coreset selection effectiveness. To further investigate and harness this interplay in deep learning, we develop a Simultaneous Weight and Sample Tailoring mechanism (SWaST) that alternately performs weight pruning and coreset selection to establish a synergistic effect in training. During this investigation, we observe that when simultaneously removing a large number of weights and samples, a phenomenon we term critical double-loss can occur, where important weights and their supportive samples are mistakenly eliminated at the same time, leading to model instability and nearly irreversible degradation that cannot be recovered in subsequent training. Unlike classic machine learning models, this issue can arise in deep learning due to the lack of theoretical guarantees on the correctness of weight pruning and coreset selection, which explains why these paradigms are often developed independently. We mitigate this by integrating a state preservation mechanism into SWaST, enabling stable joint optimization. Extensive experiments reveal a strong synergy between pruning and coreset selection across varying prune rates and coreset sizes, delivering accuracy boosts of up to 17.83% alongside 10% to 90% FLOPs reductions.

TL;DR: 本文证明了增量生成对于基于流的去噪模型在保向同胚空间中的通用逼近是必要且充分的，揭示了单步自治流无法实现通用逼近，但通过组合有限个自治流可以实现高效逼近。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于流的增量去噪模型在生成建模中表现出色，但缺乏严格的逼近理论基础。本文旨在为这类模型提供数学上的严格分析，明确增量生成在通用逼近中的必要性和充分性。

Method: 使用拓扑动力学方法证明单步自治流无法实现通用逼近，然后利用自治流的代数性质，通过组合有限个自治流来逼近保向Lipschitz同胚，并通过线性提升到高维空间来实现对连续函数和概率分布的逼近。

Result: 证明了单步自治流在保向同胚空间中是非通用的，但通过组合最多K_d个自治流可以实现O(n^{-1/d})的逼近速率，在光滑性假设下可实现维度无关的逼近速率，并能实现对连续函数和概率分布的通用逼近。

Conclusion: 增量生成是基于流去噪模型实现通用逼近的关键机制，通过有限步的自治流组合可以高效逼近复杂的变换，为这类生成模型提供了坚实的数学理论基础。

Abstract: Incremental flow-based denoising models have reshaped generative modelling, but their empirical advantage still lacks a rigorous approximation-theoretic foundation. We show that incremental generation is necessary and sufficient for universal flow-based generation on the largest natural class of self-maps of $[0,1]^d$ compatible with denoising pipelines, namely the orientation-preserving homeomorphisms of $[0,1]^d$. All our guarantees are uniform on the underlying maps and hence imply approximation both samplewise and in distribution.
  Using a new topological-dynamical argument, we first prove an impossibility theorem: the class of all single-step autonomous flows, independently of the architecture, width, depth, or Lipschitz activation of the underlying neural network, is meagre and therefore not universal in the space of orientation-preserving homeomorphisms of $[0,1]^d$. By exploiting algebraic properties of autonomous flows, we conversely show that every orientation-preserving Lipschitz homeomorphism on $[0,1]^d$ can be approximated at rate $\mathcal{O}(n^{-1/d})$ by a composition of at most $K_d$ such flows, where $K_d$ depends only on the dimension. Under additional smoothness assumptions, the approximation rate can be made dimension-free, and $K_d$ can be chosen uniformly over the class being approximated. Finally, by linearly lifting the domain into one higher dimension, we obtain structured universal approximation results for continuous functions and for probability measures on $[0,1]^d$, the latter realized as pushforwards of empirical measures with vanishing $1$-Wasserstein error.

TL;DR: PRISM是一种数据集蒸馏框架，通过使用不同架构的教师模型来解耦logit匹配和正则化目标，解决了单教师模型带来的归纳偏差问题，在ImageNet-1K上显著提升了性能和数据多样性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数据集蒸馏方法通常继承单一教师模型的归纳偏差，随着数据集规模增大，这种偏差会导致生成过于平滑、同质化的样本，降低类内多样性并限制泛化能力。

Method: PRISM框架将logit匹配和正则化目标解耦，分别用不同架构的教师模型进行监督：主模型用于logits，随机子集用于批量归一化对齐。还引入了可扩展的跨类批次形成方案进行快速并行合成。

Result: 在ImageNet-1K上，PRISM在低和中IPC机制下持续优于单教师方法（如SRe2L）和近期多教师变体（如G-VBSM）。生成的数据显示出显著更丰富的类内多样性，特征间余弦相似度显著下降。

Conclusion: PRISM通过解耦架构先验，有效提升了数据集蒸馏的性能和多样性，为大规模数据集蒸馏提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Dataset distillation (DD) promises compact yet faithful synthetic data, but existing approaches often inherit the inductive bias of a single teacher model. As dataset size increases, this bias drives generation toward overly smooth, homogeneous samples, reducing intra-class diversity and limiting generalization. We present PRISM (PRIors from diverse Source Models), a framework that disentangles architectural priors during synthesis. PRISM decouples the logit-matching and regularization objectives, supervising them with different teacher architectures: a primary model for logits and a stochastic subset for batch-normalization (BN) alignment. On ImageNet-1K, PRISM consistently and reproducibly outperforms single-teacher methods (e.g., SRe2L) and recent multi-teacher variants (e.g., G-VBSM) at low- and mid-IPC regimes. The generated data also show significantly richer intra-class diversity, as reflected by a notable drop in cosine similarity between features. We further analyze teacher selection strategies (pre- vs. intra-distillation) and introduce a scalable cross-class batch formation scheme for fast parallel synthesis. Code will be released after the review period.

TL;DR: 提出了M²V-UGAD框架，用于处理图结构数据中节点属性和边同时缺失的无监督异常检测问题，通过双路径编码器防止跨视图干扰，并利用硬负例缓解插补偏差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有无监督图异常检测方法假设完整的节点属性和结构信息，但现实场景中数据往往存在缺失。标准插补方法可能修复异常节点使其看起来正常，且节点属性和边同时缺失时会产生跨视图干扰，影响检测性能。

Method: 使用双路径编码器独立重建缺失的节点属性和图结构，防止错误传播；在联合潜在空间中融合和正则化，使正常节点占据紧凑内流形，异常节点位于外表面；采样潜在空间外部的编码解码为真实节点特征和子图，提供硬负例以锐化决策边界。

Result: 在七个公共基准测试上的实验表明，M²V-UGAD在不同缺失率下始终优于现有的无监督图异常检测方法。

Conclusion: M²V-UGAD有效解决了图数据中多重缺失值带来的挑战，通过防止跨视图干扰和缓解插补偏差，显著提升了无监督图异常检测的性能。

Abstract: Unsupervised graph anomaly detection (GAD) has received increasing attention in recent years, which aims to identify data anomalous patterns utilizing only unlabeled node information from graph-structured data. However, prevailing unsupervised GAD methods typically presuppose complete node attributes and structure information, a condition hardly satisfied in real-world scenarios owing to privacy, collection errors or dynamic node arrivals. Existing standard imputation schemes risk "repairing" rare anomalous nodes so that they appear normal, thereby introducing imputation bias into the detection process. In addition, when both node attributes and edges are missing simultaneously, estimation errors in one view can contaminate the other, causing cross-view interference that further undermines the detection performance. To overcome these challenges, we propose M$^2$V-UGAD, a multiple missing values-resistant unsupervised GAD framework on incomplete graphs. Specifically, a dual-pathway encoder is first proposed to independently reconstruct missing node attributes and graph structure, thereby preventing errors in one view from propagating to the other. The two pathways are then fused and regularized in a joint latent space so that normals occupy a compact inner manifold while anomalies reside on an outer shell. Lastly, to mitigate imputation bias, we sample latent codes just outside the normal region and decode them into realistic node features and subgraphs, providing hard negative examples that sharpen the decision boundary. Experiments on seven public benchmarks demonstrate that M$^2$V-UGAD consistently outperforms existing unsupervised GAD methods across varying missing rates.

Conclusion: TD-ES提供了一条简单、计算量小的路径，实现可靠的策略精炼，在保持早期样本效率的同时实现稳健的后期增益。

Abstract: Improving competent robot policies with on-policy RL is often hampered by noisy, low-signal gradients. We revisit Evolution Strategies (ES) as a policy-gradient proxy and localize exploration with bounded, antithetic triangular perturbations, suitable for policy refinement. We propose Triangular-Distribution ES (TD-ES) which pairs bounded triangular noise with a centered-rank finite-difference estimator to deliver stable, parallelizable, gradient-free updates. In a two-stage pipeline -- PPO pretraining followed by TD-ES refinement -- this preserves early sample efficiency while enabling robust late-stage gains. Across a suite of robotic manipulation tasks, TD-ES raises success rates by 26.5% relative to PPO and greatly reduces variance, offering a simple, compute-light path to reliable refinement.

Motivation: 传统MLP方法在时间序列预测中存在三个关键问题：弱季节性信号丢失、权重共享MLP的容量限制，以及通道独立策略中通道融合不足。这些问题限制了MLP方法的性能。

Method: 1. 自适应融合双域季节性MLP：将季节信号分为强弱分量，采用自适应零初始化通道融合策略；2. 能量不变注意力机制：自适应关注趋势和季节预测中的不同特征通道，保持总信号能量恒定；3. 动态容量调整机制：根据通道数平方根缩放神经元数量。

Conclusion: MDMLP-EIA通过创新的多域动态MLP架构，有效解决了传统MLP方法的局限性，在时间序列预测任务中实现了优异的性能表现。

Abstract: Time series forecasting is essential across diverse domains. While MLP-based methods have gained attention for achieving Transformer-comparable performance with fewer parameters and better robustness, they face critical limitations including loss of weak seasonal signals, capacity constraints in weight-sharing MLPs, and insufficient channel fusion in channel-independent strategies. To address these challenges, we propose MDMLP-EIA (Multi-domain Dynamic MLPs with Energy Invariant Attention) with three key innovations. First, we develop an adaptive fused dual-domain seasonal MLP that categorizes seasonal signals into strong and weak components. It employs an adaptive zero-initialized channel fusion strategy to minimize noise interference while effectively integrating predictions. Second, we introduce an energy invariant attention mechanism that adaptively focuses on different feature channels within trend and seasonal predictions across time steps. This mechanism maintains constant total signal energy to align with the decomposition-prediction-reconstruction framework and enhance robustness against disturbances. Third, we propose a dynamic capacity adjustment mechanism for channel-independent MLPs. This mechanism scales neuron count with the square root of channel count, ensuring sufficient capacity as channels increase. Extensive experiments across nine benchmark datasets demonstrate that MDMLP-EIA achieves state-of-the-art performance in both prediction accuracy and computational efficiency.

Abstract: Scalable and generalizable analysis of brain activity is essential for advancing both clinical diagnostics and cognitive research. Electroencephalography (EEG), a non-invasive modality with high temporal resolution, has been widely used for brain states analysis. However, most existing EEG models are usually tailored for individual specific tasks, limiting their utility in realistic scenarios where EEG analysis often involves multi-task and continuous reasoning. In this work, we introduce EEGAgent, a general-purpose framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) to schedule and plan multiple tools to automatically complete EEG-related tasks. EEGAgent is capable of performing the key functions: EEG basic information perception, spatiotemporal EEG exploration, EEG event detection, interaction with users, and EEG report generation. To realize these capabilities, we design a toolbox composed of different tools for EEG preprocessing, feature extraction, event detection, etc. These capabilities were evaluated on public datasets, and our EEGAgent can support flexible and interpretable EEG analysis, highlighting its potential for real-world clinical applications.

TL;DR: 提出动态阈值确定算法，通过随时间调整检测阈值来提升漂移检测性能，证明动态策略优于任何固定阈值。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有漂移检测方法将阈值设为固定超参数，但模型性能对该阈值高度敏感。从机器学习角度看，维持模型性能是关键目标，因此研究动态阈值是否能提供更好性能。

Method: 基于理论证明，提出动态阈值确定算法，在现有漂移检测框架中增加比较阶段来调整阈值。

Conclusion: 动态阈值策略在漂移检测中优于固定阈值，能够更好地平衡误报和延迟检测，从而有效维持模型性能。

Abstract: Existing drift detection methods focus on designing sensitive test statistics. They treat the detection threshold as a fixed hyperparameter, set once to balance false alarms and late detections, and applied uniformly across all datasets and over time. However, maintaining model performance is the key objective from the perspective of machine learning, and we observe that model performance is highly sensitive to this threshold. This observation inspires us to investigate whether a dynamic threshold could be provably better. In this paper, we prove that a threshold that adapts over time can outperform any single fixed threshold. The main idea of the proof is that a dynamic strategy, constructed by combining the best threshold from each individual data segment, is guaranteed to outperform any single threshold that apply to all segments. Based on the theorem, we propose a Dynamic Threshold Determination algorithm. It enhances existing drift detection frameworks with a novel comparison phase to inform how the threshold should be adjusted. Extensive experiments on a wide range of synthetic and real-world datasets, including both image and tabular data, validate that our approach substantially enhances the performance of state-of-the-art drift detectors.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI生成内容的快速扩散改变了数字营销和在线消费者行为，但由于数据异质性、非线性传播机制和不断变化的消费者互动，预测其传播轨迹和市场影响仍然具有挑战性。

Method: 集成多源数据（社交媒体流、营销支出记录、消费者参与日志和情感动态），使用混合图神经网络和时间变换器框架，通过双通道架构联合学习内容传播结构和时间影响演化，并利用因果推断模块分析营销刺激对投资回报率和市场可见度的影响。

Conclusion: 所提出的决策支持系统通过提供对AI生成内容驱动的传播和市场增长模式的可解释实时洞察，增强了营销决策能力。

Abstract: The rapid proliferation of AI-generated content (AIGC) has reshaped the dynamics of digital marketing and online consumer behavior. However, predicting the diffusion trajectory and market impact of such content remains challenging due to data heterogeneity, non linear propagation mechanisms, and evolving consumer interactions. This study proposes an AI driven Decision Support System (DSS) that integrates multi source data including social media streams, marketing expenditure records, consumer engagement logs, and sentiment dynamics using a hybrid Graph Neural Network (GNN) and Temporal Transformer framework. The model jointly learns the content diffusion structure and temporal influence evolution through a dual channel architecture, while causal inference modules disentangle the effects of marketing stimuli on return on investment (ROI) and market visibility. Experiments on large scale real-world datasets collected from multiple online platforms such as Twitter, TikTok, and YouTube advertising show that our system outperforms existing baselines in all six metrics. The proposed DSS enhances marketing decisions by providing interpretable real-time insights into AIGC driven content dissemination and market growth patterns.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 表格数据是最丰富的数据类型，随着数据集增长和涉及多个相关目标，需要利用共享任务信息来改进多任务泛化。现有多任务学习方法主要关注推荐系统，在更广泛的表格领域潜力未被充分探索，且现有方法难以捕捉复杂特征交互。

Conclusion: MultiTab-Net成功将transformer架构应用于表格数据的多任务学习，克服了传统方法的局限性，为表格数据的多任务学习提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Tabular data is the most abundant data type in the world, powering systems in finance, healthcare, e-commerce, and beyond. As tabular datasets grow and span multiple related targets, there is an increasing need to exploit shared task information for improved multitask generalization. Multitask learning (MTL) has emerged as a powerful way to improve generalization and efficiency, yet most existing work focuses narrowly on large-scale recommendation systems, leaving its potential in broader tabular domains largely underexplored. Also, existing MTL approaches for tabular data predominantly rely on multi-layer perceptron-based backbones, which struggle to capture complex feature interactions and often fail to scale when data is abundant, a limitation that transformer architectures have overcome in other domains. Motivated by this, we introduce MultiTab-Net, the first multitask transformer architecture specifically designed for large tabular data. MultiTab-Net employs a novel multitask masked-attention mechanism that dynamically models feature-feature dependencies while mitigating task competition. Through extensive experiments, we show that MultiTab-Net consistently achieves higher multitask gain than existing MTL architectures and single-task transformers across diverse domains including large-scale recommendation data, census-like socioeconomic data, and physics datasets, spanning a wide range of task counts, task types, and feature modalities. In addition, we contribute MultiTab-Bench, a generalized multitask synthetic dataset generator that enables systematic evaluation of multitask dynamics by tuning task count, task correlations, and relative task complexity. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/Armanfard-Lab/MultiTab.

Motivation: 探索如何通过符号回归自动重新发现物理定律，特别是天文学中的基本方程，同时研究领域知识嵌入对符号回归性能的影响。

Method: 使用AI Feynman符号回归算法，通过数据预处理和搜索空间限制引入观测和归纳偏差，从月球星历数据中重新发现中心方程，并提出了自动预处理扩展以寻找规范坐标系。

Result: AI Feynman成功恢复了中心方程的一阶解析形式，但发现依赖专家驱动的坐标系选择是一个关键限制。

Conclusion: 有针对性的领域知识嵌入使符号回归能够重新发现物理定律，但在利用领域知识通过定制偏差约束符号回归推导物理方程时仍面临挑战。

Abstract: This work explores using the physics-inspired AI Feynman symbolic regression algorithm to automatically rediscover a fundamental equation in astronomy -- the Equation of the Centre. Through the introduction of observational and inductive biases corresponding to the physical nature of the system through data preprocessing and search space restriction, AI Feynman was successful in recovering the first-order analytical form of this equation from lunar ephemerides data. However, this manual approach highlights a key limitation in its reliance on expert-driven coordinate system selection. We therefore propose an automated preprocessing extension to find the canonical coordinate system. Results demonstrate that targeted domain knowledge embedding enables symbolic regression to rediscover physical laws, but also highlight further challenges in constraining symbolic regression to derive physics equations when leveraging domain knowledge through tailored biases.

Abstract: The rapid evolution of machine learning has propelled neural networks to unprecedented success across diverse domains. In particular, multimodal learning has emerged as a transformative paradigm, leveraging complementary information from heterogeneous data streams (e.g., text, vision, audio) to advance contextual reasoning and intelligent decision-making. Despite these advancements, current neural network-based models often fall short in open-world environments characterized by inherent unpredictability, where unpredictable environmental composition dynamics, incomplete modality inputs, and spurious distributions relations critically undermine system reliability. While humans naturally adapt to such dynamic, ambiguous scenarios, artificial intelligence systems exhibit stark limitations in robustness, particularly when processing multimodal signals under real-world complexity. This study investigates the fundamental challenge of multimodal learning robustness in open-world settings, aiming to bridge the gap between controlled experimental performance and practical deployment requirements.

Motivation: 解决候选模型集合过大时，传统SRM（结构风险最小化）或正则化方法过度依赖先验假设的问题，寻求更充分利用经验数据的学习方法。

Method: 提出新的学习范式，更强地整合经验数据，减少基于先验假设的算法决策，无需事先知道假设的真实参数。

Result: 分析了该方法的泛化能力，并在多种常见学习假设下展示了其优势，包括邻近点相似性、标签同质性聚类、标注规则的Lipschitz假设和对比学习假设。

Conclusion: 该方法能够在不知道真实参数的情况下有效利用各种学习假设，提供了一种比传统SRM更数据驱动的方法。

Abstract: We address the general task of learning with a set of candidate models that is too large to have a uniform convergence of empirical estimates to true losses. While the common approach to such challenges is SRM (or regularization) based learning algorithms, we propose a novel learning paradigm that relies on stronger incorporation of empirical data and requires less algorithmic decisions to be based on prior assumptions. We analyze the generalization capabilities of our approach and demonstrate its merits in several common learning assumptions, including similarity of close points, clustering of the domain into highly label-homogeneous regions, Lipschitzness assumptions of the labeling rule, and contrastive learning assumptions. Our approach allows utilizing such assumptions without the need to know their true parameters a priori.

Motivation: 传统数据库参数手动调优效率低下，现有基于强化学习的自动调优方法在离线训练时收敛速度慢，需要利用文档中的调优提示来改进训练过程。

Method: 设计结构化思维链提示让LLM从文档中提取条件感知的调优提示，并提出提示感知的演示强化学习算法HA-DDPGfD来整合这些提示到RL代理训练中。

Result: 在MySQL和PostgreSQL上的实验表明，DemoTuner在性能提升和在线调优成本降低方面显著优于DB-BERT、GPTuner和CDBTune等基线方法，且对未知工作负载具有良好适应性。

Conclusion: DemoTuner是首个将演示强化学习引入数据库参数调优的工作，通过利用文档中的调优提示有效提升了RL方法的训练效率和调优性能。

Abstract: The performance of modern DBMSs such as MySQL and PostgreSQL heavily depends on the configuration of performance-critical knobs. Manual tuning these knobs is laborious and inefficient due to the complex and high-dimensional nature of the configuration space. Among the automated tuning methods, reinforcement learning (RL)-based methods have recently sought to improve the DBMS knobs tuning process from several different perspectives. However, they still encounter challenges with slow convergence speed during offline training. In this paper, we mainly focus on how to leverage the valuable tuning hints contained in various textual documents such as DBMS manuals and web forums to improve the offline training of RL-based methods. To this end, we propose an efficient DBMS knobs tuning framework named DemoTuner via a novel LLM-assisted demonstration reinforcement learning method. Specifically, to comprehensively and accurately mine tuning hints from documents, we design a structured chain of thought prompt to employ LLMs to conduct a condition-aware tuning hints extraction task. To effectively integrate the mined tuning hints into RL agent training, we propose a hint-aware demonstration reinforcement learning algorithm HA-DDPGfD in DemoTuner. As far as we know, DemoTuner is the first work to introduce the demonstration reinforcement learning algorithm for DBMS knobs tuning. Experimental evaluations conducted on MySQL and PostgreSQL across various workloads demonstrate the significant advantages of DemoTuner in both performance improvement and online tuning cost reduction over three representative baselines including DB-BERT, GPTuner and CDBTune. Additionally, DemoTuner also exhibits superior adaptability to application scenarios with unknown workloads.

*Pilsung Kang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种量子启发的交互建模方法，通过相干聚合（求和复数振幅后平方）与不相干聚合（求和平方幅度）的对比，实现对协同与拮抗作用的机制级控制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法将交互视为工程化乘积项或灵活模型中的涌现模式，无法控制协同与拮抗的产生机制。量子观点提供了更直接的机制级控制。

Method: 基于Born规则，提出干涉核分类器（IKC），使用相干聚合创建干涉交叉项，并引入相干增益和干涉信息两个诊断指标。

Result: 在XOR任务上IKC优于强基线；在真实数据上整体有竞争力但略逊于容量最大的基线；切换聚合方式能一致改善负对数似然、Brier分数和校准误差。

Conclusion: 量子启发的相干聚合为交互建模提供了机制级控制，相干增益在真实数据上表现积极，展示了该方法在理解协同与拮抗作用方面的潜力。

Abstract: Classical approaches often treat interaction as engineered product terms or as emergent patterns in flexible models, offering little control over how synergy or antagonism arises. We take a quantum-inspired view: following the Born rule (probability as squared amplitude), \emph{coherent} aggregation sums complex amplitudes before squaring, creating an interference cross-term, whereas an \emph{incoherent} proxy sums squared magnitudes and removes it. In a minimal linear-amplitude model, this cross-term equals the standard potential-outcome interaction contrast \(Δ_{\mathrm{INT}}\) in a \(2\times 2\) factorial design, giving relative phase a direct, mechanism-level control over synergy versus antagonism.
  We instantiate this idea in a lightweight \emph{Interference Kernel Classifier} (IKC) and introduce two diagnostics: \emph{Coherent Gain} (log-likelihood gain of coherent over the incoherent proxy) and \emph{Interference Information} (the induced Kullback-Leibler gap). A controlled phase sweep recovers the identity. On a high-interaction synthetic task (XOR), IKC outperforms strong baselines under paired, budget-matched comparisons; on real tabular data (\emph{Adult} and \emph{Bank Marketing}) it is competitive overall but typically trails the most capacity-rich baseline in paired differences. Holding learned parameters fixed, toggling aggregation from incoherent to coherent consistently improves negative log-likelihood, Brier score, and expected calibration error, with positive Coherent Gain on both datasets.

TL;DR: GraphSB框架通过结构平衡策略解决图神经网络中的不平衡节点分类问题，在节点合成前优化不平衡图结构，显著提升分类性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有不平衡节点分类方法主要关注数据层面（合成少数类节点）或算法层面（优化学习过程），但都忽略了内在的不平衡图结构问题，这是导致多数类主导和少数类同化的根本原因。

Method: 提出GraphSB框架，采用结构平衡策略进行两阶段结构优化：1）结构增强-自适应构建相似性边以加强少数类节点连通性；2）关系扩散-捕捉高阶依赖关系同时放大少数类信号。

Result: 大量实验表明GraphSB显著优于现有最先进方法，且结构平衡模块可作为即插即用组件集成到现有方法中，平均提升3.67%的准确率。

Conclusion: 图结构不平衡是影响GNN性能的关键因素，GraphSB通过结构平衡策略有效解决了这一问题，为不平衡节点分类提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Imbalanced node classification is a critical challenge in graph learning, where most existing methods typically utilize Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to learn node representations. These methods can be broadly categorized into the data-level and the algorithm-level. The former aims to synthesize minority-class nodes to mitigate quantity imbalance, while the latter tries to optimize the learning process to highlight minority classes. However, neither category addresses the inherently imbalanced graph structure, which is a fundamental factor that incurs majority-class dominance and minority-class assimilation in GNNs. Our theoretical analysis further supports this critical insight. Therefore, we propose GraphSB (Graph Structural Balance), a novel framework that incorporates Structural Balance as a key strategy to address the underlying imbalanced graph structure before node synthesis. Structural Balance performs a two-stage structure optimization: Structure Enhancement that adaptively builds similarity-based edges to strengthen connectivity of minority-class nodes, and Relation Diffusion that captures higher-order dependencies while amplifying signals from minority classes. Thus, GraphSB balances structural distribution before node synthesis, enabling more effective learning in GNNs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GraphSB significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods. More importantly, the proposed Structural Balance can be seamlessly integrated into state-of-the-art methods as a simple plug-and-play module, increasing their accuracy by an average of 3.67\%.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于傅里叶或图技术的神经算子方法对核积分算子的结构做出了强假设，这可能限制表达能力。需要一种更灵活的方法来近似完整核函数。

Method: 显式参数化核的奇异值分解：两个轻量级网络学习左右奇异函数，对角参数矩阵学习奇异值，使用Gram矩阵正则化器强制正交性。在低秩基中直接进行积分。

Result: 在五个不同的基准方程上进行广泛评估，SVD-NO实现了新的最优性能，特别是在解具有高度空间变异性的PDE上表现更佳。

Conclusion: SVD-NO通过近似完整核函数获得高表达能力，同时由于低秩结构保持合理的计算复杂度，是一个实用的系统。

Abstract: Neural operators have emerged as a promising paradigm for learning solution operators of partial differential equa- tions (PDEs) directly from data. Existing methods, such as those based on Fourier or graph techniques, make strong as- sumptions about the structure of the kernel integral opera- tor, assumptions which may limit expressivity. We present SVD-NO, a neural operator that explicitly parameterizes the kernel by its singular-value decomposition (SVD) and then carries out the integral directly in the low-rank basis. Two lightweight networks learn the left and right singular func- tions, a diagonal parameter matrix learns the singular values, and a Gram-matrix regularizer enforces orthonormality. As SVD-NO approximates the full kernel, it obtains a high de- gree of expressivity. Furthermore, due to its low-rank struc- ture the computational complexity of applying the operator remains reasonable, leading to a practical system. In exten- sive evaluations on five diverse benchmark equations, SVD- NO achieves a new state of the art. In particular, SVD-NO provides greater performance gains on PDEs whose solutions are highly spatially variable. The code of this work is publicly available at https://github.com/2noamk/SVDNO.git.

Conclusion: 该方法能有效处理受外部干扰的观测数据，通过引入潜在变量和利用专家知识提高了因果推断的可靠性。

Abstract: Inferring causal relationships from observed data is an important task, yet it becomes challenging when the data is subject to various external interferences. Most of these interferences are the additional effects of external factors on observed variables. Since these external factors are often unknown, we introduce latent variables to represent these unobserved factors that affect the observed data. Specifically, to capture the causal strength and adjacency information, we propose a new temporal latent variable structural causal model, incorporating causal strength and adjacency coefficients that represent the causal relationships between variables. Considering that expert knowledge can provide information about unknown interferences in certain scenarios, we develop a method that facilitates the incorporation of prior knowledge into parameter learning based on Variational Inference, to guide the model estimation. Experimental results demonstrate the stability and accuracy of our proposed method.

TL;DR: MoE模型通过仅激活部分专家网络来减少计算量，但模型规模增长导致参数超出GPU内存容量。现有系统通过将非活跃专家卸载到CPU内存来解决，但PCIe传输延迟显著。预取启发式方法旨在隐藏延迟，但预取失败会导致显著延迟或模型精度下降。


<details>

Motivation: 解决MoE模型中因预取失败导致的推理延迟和模型精度下降问题，在保持高推理速度的同时确保模型准确性。

Method: 通过将非活跃专家卸载到CPU内存，使用预取启发式方法预测所需专家，但面临预取失败时的挑战。

Result: 现有方法在预取失败时要么产生长延迟（按需获取专家），要么显著降低模型精度（丢弃专家）。

Conclusion: 关键挑战是在预取失败时同时保持高推理速度和模型精度。

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures scale language models by activating only a subset of specialized expert networks for each input token, thereby reducing the number of floating-point operations. However, the growing size of modern MoE models causes their full parameter sets to exceed GPU memory capacity; for example, Mixtral-8x7B has 45 billion parameters and requires 87 GB of memory even though only 14 billion parameters are used per token. Existing systems alleviate this limitation by offloading inactive experts to CPU memory, but transferring experts across the PCIe interconnect incurs significant latency (about 10 ms). Prefetching heuristics aim to hide this latency by predicting which experts are needed, but prefetch failures introduce significant stalls and amplify inference latency. In the event of a prefetch failure, prior work offers two primary solutions: either fetch the expert on demand, which incurs a long stall due to the PCIe bottleneck, or drop the expert from the computation, which significantly degrades model accuracy. The critical challenge, therefore, is to maintain both high inference speed and model accuracy when prefetching fails.

Conclusion: 该研究提供了对离散蛋白质结构表示本质的基本见解，并引入了一种强大、近乎瞬时的方法来建模蛋白质动力学，为理解结构标记化提供了新视角。

Abstract: Protein structure tokenization converts 3D structures into discrete or vectorized representations, enabling the integration of structural and sequence data. Despite many recent works on structure tokenization, the properties of the underlying discrete representations are not well understood. In this work, we first demonstrate that the successful utilization of structural tokens in a language model for structure prediction depends on using rich, pre-trained sequence embeddings to bridge the semantic gap between the sequence and structural "language". The analysis of the structural vocabulary itself then reveals significant semantic redundancy, where multiple distinct tokens correspond to nearly identical local geometries, acting as "structural synonyms". This redundancy, rather than being a flaw, can be exploited with a simple "synonym swap" strategy to generate diverse conformational ensembles by perturbing a predicted structure with its structural synonyms. This computationally lightweight method accurately recapitulates protein flexibility, performing competitively with state-of-the-art models. Our study provides fundamental insights into the nature of discrete protein structure representations and introduces a powerful, near-instantaneous method for modeling protein dynamics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在NISQ时代，混合量子神经网络在经典模拟器上训练时，FLOPs直接决定运行时间和可扩展性，因此需要将FLOPs作为计算复杂度的实用度量标准。

Method: 将HQNN设计建模为多目标优化问题，明确将FLOPs纳入优化目标，平衡准确性和计算成本。

Result: 在五个基准数据集上的实验表明，量子FLOPs主导准确性改进，而经典FLOPs基本固定。相比FLOPs无关的基线，Pareto最优解能在显著降低计算成本的同时保持竞争力。

Conclusion: FLOPs感知性是NISQ时代HQNN设计的实用标准，也是未来HQNN系统的可扩展原则。

Abstract: Hybrid Quantum Neural Networks (HQNNs), which combine parameterized quantum circuits with classical neural layers, are emerging as promising models in the noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) era. While quantum circuits are not naturally measured in floating point operations (FLOPs), most HQNNs (in NISQ era) are still trained on classical simulators where FLOPs directly dictate runtime and scalability. Hence, FLOPs represent a practical and viable metric to measure the computational complexity of HQNNs. In this work, we introduce FAQNAS, a FLOPs-aware neural architecture search (NAS) framework that formulates HQNN design as a multi-objective optimization problem balancing accuracy and FLOPs. Unlike traditional approaches, FAQNAS explicitly incorporates FLOPs into the optimization objective, enabling the discovery of architectures that achieve strong performance while minimizing computational cost. Experiments on five benchmark datasets (MNIST, Digits, Wine, Breast Cancer, and Iris) show that quantum FLOPs dominate accuracy improvements, while classical FLOPs remain largely fixed. Pareto-optimal solutions reveal that competitive accuracy can often be achieved with significantly reduced computational cost compared to FLOPs-agnostic baselines. Our results establish FLOPs-awareness as a practical criterion for HQNN design in the NISQ era and as a scalable principle for future HQNN systems.

Abstract: Urban Network Security Games (UNSGs), which model the strategic allocation of limited security resources on city road networks, are critical for urban safety. However, finding a Nash Equilibrium (NE) in large-scale UNSGs is challenging due to their massive and combinatorial action spaces. One common approach to addressing these games is the Policy-Space Response Oracle (PSRO) framework, which requires computing best responses (BR) at each iteration. However, precisely computing exact BRs is impractical in large-scale games, and employing reinforcement learning to approximate BRs inevitably introduces errors, which limits the overall effectiveness of the PSRO methods. Recent advancements in leveraging non-convex stochastic optimization to approximate an NE offer a promising alternative to the burdensome BR computation. However, utilizing existing stochastic optimization techniques with an unbiased loss function for UNSGs remains challenging because the action spaces are too vast to be effectively represented by neural networks. To address these issues, we introduce Tree-based Stochastic Optimization (TSO), a framework that bridges the gap between the stochastic optimization paradigm for NE-finding and the demands of UNSGs. Specifically, we employ the tree-based action representation that maps the whole action space onto a tree structure, addressing the challenge faced by neural networks in representing actions when the action space cannot be enumerated. We then incorporate this representation into the loss function and theoretically demonstrate its equivalence to the unbiased loss function. To further enhance the quality of the converged solution, we introduce a sample-and-prune mechanism that reduces the risk of being trapped in suboptimal local optima. Extensive experimental results indicate the superiority of TSO over other baseline algorithms in addressing the UNSGs.

Motivation: 当前后验可解释性方法存在安全漏洞，攻击者可以在不改变模型预测的情况下操纵解释结果，这在安全关键应用中存在严重风险。

Method: 开发了单步黑盒攻击方法，仅需模型的预测和解释结果，无需访问模型权重，针对显著性图、积分梯度和DeepLIFT SHAP等解释方法生成对抗样本。

Result: 攻击成功显著改变了所有测试解释方法的输出，同时保持了原始图像的视觉相似性和相同的预测概率，验证了攻击的有效性。

Conclusion: 当前可解释性方法存在严重脆弱性，攻击者可以轻易操纵解释结果而不被察觉，这对安全关键应用中的可解释AI可靠性提出了重大质疑。

Abstract: Post-hoc explainability methods are a subset of Machine Learning (ML) that aim to provide a reason for why a model behaves in a certain way. In this paper, we show a new black-box model-agnostic adversarial attack for post-hoc explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI), particularly in the image domain. The goal of the attack is to modify the original explanations while being undetected by the human eye and maintain the same predicted class. In contrast to previous methods, we do not require any access to the model or its weights, but only to the model's computed predictions and explanations. Additionally, the attack is accomplished in a single step while significantly changing the provided explanations, as demonstrated by empirical evaluation. The low requirements of our method expose a critical vulnerability in current explainability methods, raising concerns about their reliability in safety-critical applications. We systematically generate attacks based on the explanations generated by post-hoc explainability methods (saliency maps, integrated gradients, and DeepLIFT SHAP) for pretrained ResNet-18 and ViT-B16 on ImageNet. The results show that our attacks could lead to dramatically different explanations without changing the predictive probabilities. We validate the effectiveness of our attack, compute the induced change based on the explanation with mean absolute difference, and verify the closeness of the original image and the corrupted one with the Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM).

Motivation: 研究动机是调查文本到图像生成模型是否在其预训练潜在空间中系统性地编码了社会偏见，这些偏见可能损害组织伦理和负责任AI管理。

Method: 使用五个最流行的开源T2I模型，基于十个中性职业提示生成5000张图像，由代表不同种族和性别的多样化人类评估者进行评估。

Result: 所有五个模型都编码并放大了明显的社会偏见：护理角色持续女性化，而高管、政治家、医生和律师等高地位职业主要由男性和白人代表。不同模型有特定模式，如QWEN-Image专注于东亚输出，Kandinsky主导白人个体，SDXL分布较广但仍存在偏见。

Conclusion: 这些结果为AI项目经理提供了关键见解，帮助他们选择公平的AI模型和定制提示，以生成符合负责任AI原则的图像。研究还讨论了这些偏见风险，并提出了在构建负责任生成式AI系统中缓解偏见的可行策略。

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) generative models are largely used in AI-powered real-world applications and value creation. However, their strategic deployment raises critical concerns for responsible AI management, particularly regarding the reproduction and amplification of race- and gender-related stereotypes that can undermine organizational ethics. In this work, we investigate whether such societal biases are systematically encoded within the pretrained latent spaces of state-of-the-art T2I models. We conduct an empirical study across the five most popular open-source models, using ten neutral, profession-related prompts to generate 100 images per profession, resulting in a dataset of 5,000 images evaluated by diverse human assessors representing different races and genders. We demonstrate that all five models encode and amplify pronounced societal skew: caregiving and nursing roles are consistently feminized, while high-status professions such as corporate CEO, politician, doctor, and lawyer are overwhelmingly represented by males and mostly White individuals. We further identify model-specific patterns, such as QWEN-Image's near-exclusive focus on East Asian outputs, Kandinsky's dominance of White individuals, and SDXL's comparatively broader but still biased distributions. These results provide critical insights for AI project managers and practitioners, enabling them to select equitable AI models and customized prompts that generate images in alignment with the principles of responsible AI. We conclude by discussing the risks of these biases and proposing actionable strategies for bias mitigation in building responsible GenAI systems.

Abstract: Although recent generative models are remarkably capable of producing instruction-following and realistic outputs, they remain prone to notable physical plausibility failures. Though critical in applications, these physical plausibility errors often escape detection by existing evaluation methods. Furthermore, no framework exists for automatically identifying and interpreting specific physical error patterns in natural language, preventing targeted model improvements. We introduce Matryoshka Transcoders, a novel framework for the automatic discovery and interpretation of physical plausibility features in generative models. Our approach extends the Matryoshka representation learning paradigm to transcoder architectures, enabling hierarchical sparse feature learning at multiple granularity levels. By training on intermediate representations from a physical plausibility classifier and leveraging large multimodal models for interpretation, our method identifies diverse physics-related failure modes without manual feature engineering, achieving superior feature relevance and feature accuracy compared to existing approaches. We utilize the discovered visual patterns to establish a benchmark for evaluating physical plausibility in generative models. Our analysis of eight state-of-the-art generative models provides valuable insights into how these models fail to follow physical constraints, paving the way for further model improvements.

Method: 引入残差感知损失，通过强制残差序列与随机时间序列之间的依赖性来建模噪声结构，并推导了首个具有显式双样本复杂度项的非渐近HSIC边界

Result: 在8个真实世界基准测试和5个领先预测模型上的实验显示预测性能提升

Conclusion: RI-Loss方法能有效提高时间序列预测的鲁棒性和性能，代码将公开以确保可复现性

Abstract: Time series forecasting relies on predicting future values from historical data, yet most state-of-the-art approaches-including transformer and multilayer perceptron-based models-optimize using Mean Squared Error (MSE), which has two fundamental weaknesses: its point-wise error computation fails to capture temporal relationships, and it does not account for inherent noise in the data. To overcome these limitations, we introduce the Residual-Informed Loss (RI-Loss), a novel objective function based on the Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion (HSIC). RI-Loss explicitly models noise structure by enforcing dependence between the residual sequence and a random time series, enabling more robust, noise-aware representations. Theoretically, we derive the first non-asymptotic HSIC bound with explicit double-sample complexity terms, achieving optimal convergence rates through Bernstein-type concentration inequalities and Rademacher complexity analysis. This provides rigorous guarantees for RI-Loss optimization while precisely quantifying kernel space interactions. Empirically, experiments across eight real-world benchmarks and five leading forecasting models demonstrate improvements in predictive performance, validating the effectiveness of our approach. Code will be made publicly available to ensure reproducibility.

Conclusion: 仅使用能量偏好信号即可有效引导生成模型产生热力学一致的构象集成，为结构生物学和药物发现提供了替代长MD模拟的方法。

Abstract: Accurate exploration of protein conformational ensembles is essential for uncovering function but remains hard because molecular-dynamics (MD) simulations suffer from high computational costs and energy-barrier trapping. This paper presents Energy Preference Optimization (EPO), an online refinement algorithm that turns a pretrained protein ensemble generator into an energy-aware sampler without extra MD trajectories. Specifically, EPO leverages stochastic differential equation sampling to explore the conformational landscape and incorporates a novel energy-ranking mechanism based on list-wise preference optimization. Crucially, EPO introduces a practical upper bound to efficiently approximate the intractable probability of long sampling trajectories in continuous-time generative models, making it easily adaptable to existing pretrained generators. On Tetrapeptides, ATLAS, and Fast-Folding benchmarks, EPO successfully generates diverse and physically realistic ensembles, establishing a new state-of-the-art in nine evaluation metrics. These results demonstrate that energy-only preference signals can efficiently steer generative models toward thermodynamically consistent conformational ensembles, providing an alternative to long MD simulations and widening the applicability of learned potentials in structural biology and drug discovery.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实应用中强化学习通常面临样本有限的问题，离线强化学习在这种约束下性能往往不理想，需要寻找替代方法来处理有限样本问题

Method: 引入量子度量编码器(QME)，将状态嵌入到更紧凑且有意义的表示中，编码结构受量子电路启发。对于经典数据，QME是可经典模拟的可训练酉嵌入；对于量子数据，可直接在量子硬件上实现

Result: 在三个数据集（各100个样本）上评估，使用SAC和IQL算法，QME嵌入状态相比原始状态在最大奖励性能上平均提升116.2%（SAC）和117.6%（IQL），且嵌入状态表现出低Δ-双曲性

Conclusion: QME通过改变状态空间的几何结构来提升离线强化学习性能，低Δ-双曲性和QME的有效性可为开发有限样本条件下的高效离线强化学习方法提供有价值的信息

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) with limited samples is common in real-world applications. However, offline RL performance under this constraint is often suboptimal. We consider an alternative approach to dealing with limited samples by introducing the Quantum Metric Encoder (QME). In this methodology, instead of applying the RL framework directly on the original states and rewards, we embed the states into a more compact and meaningful representation, where the structure of the encoding is inspired by quantum circuits. For classical data, QME is a classically simulable, trainable unitary embedding and thus serves as a quantum-inspired module, on a classical device. For quantum data in the form of quantum states, QME can be implemented directly on quantum hardware, allowing for training without measurement or re-encoding.
  We evaluated QME on three datasets, each limited to 100 samples. We use Soft-Actor-Critic (SAC) and Implicit-Q-Learning (IQL), two well-known RL algorithms, to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. From the experimental results, we find that training offline RL agents on QME-embedded states with decoded rewards yields significantly better performance than training on the original states and rewards. On average across the three datasets, for maximum reward performance, we achieve a 116.2% improvement for SAC and 117.6% for IQL.
  We further investigate the $Δ$-hyperbolicity of our framework, a geometric property of the state space known to be important for the RL training efficacy. The QME-embedded states exhibit low $Δ$-hyperbolicity, suggesting that the improvement after embedding arises from the modified geometry of the state space induced by QME. Thus, the low $Δ$-hyperbolicity and the corresponding effectiveness of QME could provide valuable information for developing efficient offline RL methods under limited-sample conditions.

Conclusion: 向量量化的标记序列作为替代特征表示，在利用动物发声中的序列信息方面具有潜力。

Abstract: Animal vocalizations contain sequential structures that carry important communicative information, yet most computational bioacoustics studies average the extracted frame-level features across the temporal axis, discarding the order of the sub-units within a vocalization. This paper investigates whether discrete acoustic token sequences, derived through vector quantization and gumbel-softmax vector quantization of extracted self-supervised speech model representations can effectively capture and leverage temporal information. To that end, pairwise distance analysis of token sequences generated from HuBERT embeddings shows that they can discriminate call-types and callers across four bioacoustics datasets. Sequence classification experiments using $k$-Nearest Neighbour with Levenshtein distance show that the vector-quantized token sequences yield reasonable call-type and caller classification performances, and hold promise as alternative feature representations towards leveraging sequential information in animal vocalizations.

Conclusion: OCE-TS通过有序分类方法有效解决了传统回归模型的不确定性估计和异常值鲁棒性问题，在时间序列预测中表现出优越性能。

Abstract: Time series forecasting is an important task that involves analyzing temporal dependencies and underlying patterns (such as trends, cyclicality, and seasonality) in historical data to predict future values or trends. Current deep learning-based forecasting models primarily employ Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss functions for regression modeling. Despite enabling direct value prediction, this method offers no uncertainty estimation and exhibits poor outlier robustness. To address these limitations, we propose OCE-TS, a novel ordinal classification approach for time series forecasting that replaces MSE with Ordinal Cross-Entropy (OCE) loss, preserving prediction order while quantifying uncertainty through probability output. Specifically, OCE-TS begins by discretizing observed values into ordered intervals and deriving their probabilities via a parametric distribution as supervision signals. Using a simple linear model, we then predict probability distributions for each timestep. The OCE loss is computed between the cumulative distributions of predicted and ground-truth probabilities, explicitly preserving ordinal relationships among forecasted values. Through theoretical analysis using influence functions, we establish that cross-entropy (CE) loss exhibits superior stability and outlier robustness compared to MSE loss. Empirically, we compared OCE-TS with five baseline models-Autoformer, DLinear, iTransformer, TimeXer, and TimeBridge-on seven public time series datasets. Using MSE and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) as evaluation metrics, the results demonstrate that OCE-TS consistently outperforms benchmark models. The code will be published.

Abstract: Attention mechanisms underpin the computational power of Transformer models, which have achieved remarkable success across diverse domains. Yet understanding and extending the principles underlying self-attention remains a key challenge for advancing artificial intelligence. Drawing inspiration from the multiscale dynamics of biological attention and from dynamical systems theory, we introduce Fractional Neural Attention (FNA), a principled, neuroscience-inspired framework for multiscale information processing. FNA models token interactions through Lévy diffusion governed by the fractional Laplacian, intrinsically realizing simultaneous short- and long-range dependencies across multiple scales. This mechanism yields greater expressivity and faster information mixing, advancing the foundational capacity of Transformers. Theoretically, we show that FNA's dynamics are governed by the fractional diffusion equation, and that the resulting attention networks exhibit larger spectral gaps and shorter path lengths -- mechanistic signatures of enhanced computational efficiency. Empirically, FNA achieves competitive text-classification performance even with a single layer and a single head; it also improves performance in image processing and neural machine translation. Finally, the diffusion map algorithm from geometric harmonics enables dimensionality reduction of FNA weights while preserving the intrinsic structure of embeddings and hidden states. Together, these results establish FNA as a principled mechanism connecting self-attention, stochastic dynamics, and geometry, providing an interpretable, biologically grounded foundation for powerful, neuroscience-inspired AI.

Abstract: Out-of-context misinformation (OOC) is a low-cost form of misinformation in news reports, which refers to place authentic images into out-of-context or fabricated image-text pairings. This problem has attracted significant attention from researchers in recent years. Current methods focus on assessing image-text consistency or generating explanations. However, these approaches assume that the training and test data are drawn from the same distribution. When encountering novel news domains, models tend to perform poorly due to the lack of prior knowledge. To address this challenge, we propose \textbf{VDT} to enhance the domain adaptation capability for OOC misinformation detection by learning domain-invariant features and test-time training mechanisms. Domain-Invariant Variational Align module is employed to jointly encodes source and target domain data to learn a separable distributional space domain-invariant features. For preserving semantic integrity, we utilize domain consistency constraint module to reconstruct the source and target domain latent distribution. During testing phase, we adopt the test-time training strategy and confidence-variance filtering module to dynamically updating the VAE encoder and classifier, facilitating the model's adaptation to the target domain distribution. Extensive experiments conducted on the benchmark dataset NewsCLIPpings demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines under most domain adaptation settings.

TL;DR: FedCure是一个创新的半异步联邦学习框架，通过联盟构建和参与感知调度来解决非IID数据下的参与偏差问题，在四个真实数据集上相比基线方法准确率提升高达5.1倍。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 半异步联邦学习虽然结合了同步训练效率和异步更新灵活性，但存在参与偏差问题，特别是在非IID数据分布下更为严重。分层架构进一步加剧了这一问题，现有研究大多忽视非IID数据在云-边-客户端层次调度中的关键影响。

Conclusion: FedCure通过联盟构建和参与感知调度有效缓解了非IID数据下的参与偏差问题，在准确性和效率方面均表现出显著优势，为分层联邦学习系统提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: While semi-asynchronous federated learning (SAFL) combines the efficiency of synchronous training with the flexibility of asynchronous updates, it inherently suffers from participation bias, which is further exacerbated by non-IID data distributions. More importantly, hierarchical architecture shifts participation from individual clients to client groups, thereby further intensifying this issue. Despite notable advancements in SAFL research, most existing works still focus on conventional cloud-end architectures while largely overlooking the critical impact of non-IID data on scheduling across the cloud-edge-client hierarchy. To tackle these challenges, we propose FedCure, an innovative semi-asynchronous Federated learning framework that leverages coalition construction and participation-aware scheduling to mitigate participation bias with non-IID data. Specifically, FedCure operates through three key rules: (1) a preference rule that optimizes coalition formation by maximizing collective benefits and establishing theoretically stable partitions to reduce non-IID-induced performance degradation; (2) a scheduling rule that integrates the virtual queue technique with Bayesian-estimated coalition dynamics, mitigating efficiency loss while ensuring mean rate stability; and (3) a resource allocation rule that enhances computational efficiency by optimizing client CPU frequencies based on estimated coalition dynamics while satisfying delay requirements. Comprehensive experiments on four real-world datasets demonstrate that FedCure improves accuracy by up to 5.1x compared with four state-of-the-art baselines, while significantly enhancing efficiency with the lowest coefficient of variation 0.0223 for per-round latency and maintaining long-term balance across diverse scenarios.

Conclusion: LLM图推理器在对称性不变性方面存在鲁棒性问题，微调虽然能改善某些方面的敏感性但可能在其他方面产生负面影响，且不能保证在未见任务上的泛化性能提升。

Abstract: While promising, graph reasoners based on Large Language Models (LLMs) lack built-in invariance to symmetries in graph representations. Operating on sequential graph serializations, LLMs can produce different outputs under node reindexing, edge reordering, or formatting changes, raising robustness concerns. We systematically analyze these effects, studying how fine-tuning impacts encoding sensitivity as well generalization on unseen tasks. We propose a principled decomposition of graph serializations into node labeling, edge encoding, and syntax, and evaluate LLM robustness to variations of each of these factors on a comprehensive benchmarking suite. We also contribute a novel set of spectral tasks to further assess generalization abilities of fine-tuned reasoners. Results show that larger (non-fine-tuned) models are more robust. Fine-tuning reduces sensitivity to node relabeling but may increase it to variations in structure and format, while it does not consistently improve performance on unseen tasks.

Abstract: Transformers have demonstrated exceptional in-context learning (ICL) capabilities, enabling applications across natural language processing, computer vision, and sequential decision-making. In reinforcement learning, ICL reframes learning as a supervised problem, facilitating task adaptation without parameter updates. Building on prior work leveraging transformers for sequential decision-making, we propose Heuristic Transformer (HT), an in-context reinforcement learning (ICRL) approach that augments the in-context dataset with a belief distribution over rewards to achieve better decision-making. Using a variational auto-encoder (VAE), a low-dimensional stochastic variable is learned to represent the posterior distribution over rewards, which is incorporated alongside an in-context dataset and query states as prompt to the transformer policy. We assess the performance of HT across the Darkroom, Miniworld, and MuJoCo environments, showing that it consistently surpasses comparable baselines in terms of both effectiveness and generalization. Our method presents a promising direction to bridge the gap between belief-based augmentations and transformer-based decision-making.

Abstract: Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across various domains, including computer vision and natural language processing. However, they often struggle to accurately quantify the uncertainty of their predictions, limiting their broader adoption in critical real-world applications. Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) for Deep Learning seeks to address this challenge by providing methods to improve the reliability of uncertainty estimates. Although numerous techniques have been proposed, a unified tool offering a seamless workflow to evaluate and integrate these methods remains lacking. To bridge this gap, we introduce Torch-Uncertainty, a PyTorch and Lightning-based framework designed to streamline DNN training and evaluation with UQ techniques and metrics. In this paper, we outline the foundational principles of our library and present comprehensive experimental results that benchmark a diverse set of UQ methods across classification, segmentation, and regression tasks.

Conclusion: 该工作强调了当前MLLMs在内容安全方面的严重不足，提出了全面的评估框架和指标，为未来多模态模型的安全发展提供了重要基准。

Abstract: Since Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are increasingly being integrated into everyday tools and intelligent agents, growing concerns have arisen regarding their possible output of unsafe contents, ranging from toxic language and biased imagery to privacy violations and harmful misinformation. Current safety benchmarks remain highly limited in both modality coverage and performance evaluations, often neglecting the extensive landscape of content safety. In this work, we introduce OutSafe-Bench, the first most comprehensive content safety evaluation test suite designed for the multimodal era. OutSafe-Bench includes a large-scale dataset that spans four modalities, featuring over 18,000 bilingual (Chinese and English) text prompts, 4,500 images, 450 audio clips and 450 videos, all systematically annotated across nine critical content risk categories. In addition to the dataset, we introduce a Multidimensional Cross Risk Score (MCRS), a novel metric designed to model and assess overlapping and correlated content risks across different categories. To ensure fair and robust evaluation, we propose FairScore, an explainable automated multi-reviewer weighted aggregation framework. FairScore selects top-performing models as adaptive juries, thereby mitigating biases from single-model judgments and enhancing overall evaluation reliability. Our evaluation of nine state-of-the-art MLLMs reveals persistent and substantial safety vulnerabilities, underscoring the pressing need for robust safeguards in MLLMs.

Motivation: 现有方法通过全局平衡分布处理混淆偏差，但忽略了个体异质性和局部结构信息，影响个体治疗效果估计的准确性

Method: 定义基于相同治疗下相似个体的聚类中心作为原型，执行实例-原型匹配，设计多原型对齐策略使匹配原型在潜在空间中接近

Conclusion: PITE通过细粒度的原型级对齐减少分布偏移，同时保留处理组和对照组的局部结构，为个体治疗效果估计提供有意义的约束

Abstract: Estimating Individual Treatment Effects (ITE) from observational data is challenging due to confounding bias. Most studies tackle this bias by balancing distributions globally, but ignore individual heterogeneity and fail to capture the local structure that represents the natural clustering among individuals, which ultimately compromises ITE estimation. While instance-level alignment methods consider heterogeneity, they similarly overlook the local structure information. To address these issues, we propose an end-to-end Multi-\textbf{P}rototype alignment method for \textbf{ITE} estimation (\textbf{PITE}). PITE effectively captures local structure within groups and enforces cross-group alignment, thereby achieving robust ITE estimation. Specifically, we first define prototypes as cluster centroids based on similar individuals under the same treatment. To identify local similarity and the distribution consistency, we perform instance-to-prototype matching to assign individuals to the nearest prototype within groups, and design a multi-prototype alignment strategy to encourage the matched prototypes to be close across treatment arms in the latent space. PITE not only reduces distribution shift through fine-grained, prototype-level alignment, but also preserves the local structures of treated and control groups, which provides meaningful constraints for ITE estimation. Extensive evaluations on benchmark datasets demonstrate that PITE outperforms 13 state-of-the-art methods, achieving more accurate and robust ITE estimation.

Conclusion: DeMABAR算法为去中心化多智能体协作提供了对抗攻击下的鲁棒解决方案，在多种攻击场景下都能保持良好性能。

Abstract: Decentralized cooperative multi-agent multi-armed bandits (DeCMA2B) considers how multiple agents collaborate in a decentralized multi-armed bandit setting. Though this problem has been extensively studied in previous work, most existing methods remain susceptible to various adversarial attacks. In this paper, we first study DeCMA2B with adversarial corruption, where an adversary can corrupt reward observations of all agents with a limited corruption budget. We propose a robust algorithm, called DeMABAR, which ensures that each agent's individual regret suffers only an additive term proportional to the corruption budget. Then we consider a more realistic scenario where the adversary can only attack a small number of agents. Our theoretical analysis shows that the DeMABAR algorithm can also almost completely eliminate the influence of adversarial attacks and is inherently robust in the Byzantine setting, where an unknown fraction of the agents can be Byzantine, i.e., may arbitrarily select arms and communicate wrong information. We also conduct numerical experiments to illustrate the robustness and effectiveness of the proposed method.

Conclusion: 邻接矩阵表示揭示了损失函数的商空间结构，每个临界值在商空间中只出现一次，其他具有相同临界值的临界点属于相应的纤维。该方法还能确定鞍点处的稳定和不稳定子流形。

Abstract: The paper surveys recent progresses in understanding the dynamics and loss landscape of the gradient flow equations associated to deep linear neural networks, i.e., the gradient descent training dynamics (in the limit when the step size goes to 0) of deep neural networks missing the activation functions and subject to quadratic loss functions. When formulated in terms of the adjacency matrix of the neural network, as we do in the paper, these gradient flow equations form a class of converging matrix ODEs which is nilpotent, polynomial, isospectral, and with conservation laws. The loss landscape is described in detail. It is characterized by infinitely many global minima and saddle points, both strict and nonstrict, but lacks local minima and maxima. The loss function itself is a positive semidefinite Lyapunov function for the gradient flow, and its level sets are unbounded invariant sets of critical points, with critical values that correspond to the amount of singular values of the input-output data learnt by the gradient along a certain trajectory. The adjacency matrix representation we use in the paper allows to highlight the existence of a quotient space structure in which each critical value of the loss function is represented only once, while all other critical points with the same critical value belong to the fiber associated to the quotient space. It also allows to easily determine stable and unstable submanifolds at the saddle points, even when the Hessian fails to obtain them.

Motivation: 传统学习乘积分布需要Ω(d/ε²)样本，但如果有参考分布Q的参数作为先验知识，且P与Q相似，可能显著减少所需样本量。

Method: 开发了一个高效算法，利用参考分布Q的参数，在P和Q均值向量L1距离较小时实现更高效的学习。

Result: 当∥p-q∥₁ < εd^{0.5-Ω(η)}时，算法能以Õ(d^{1-η}/ε²)样本复杂度学习P，相比传统方法有指数级改进。

Conclusion: 在有相似参考分布的情况下，可以显著降低学习乘积分布的样本复杂度，为利用先验知识进行高效分布学习提供了新思路。

Abstract: Given i.i.d.~samples from an unknown distribution $P$, the goal of distribution learning is to recover the parameters of a distribution that is close to $P$. When $P$ belongs to the class of product distributions on the Boolean hypercube $\{0,1\}^d$, it is known that $Ω(d/\varepsilon^2)$ samples are necessary to learn $P$ within total variation (TV) distance $\varepsilon$. We revisit this problem when the learner is also given as advice the parameters of a product distribution $Q$. We show that there is an efficient algorithm to learn $P$ within TV distance $\varepsilon$ that has sample complexity $\tilde{O}(d^{1-η}/\varepsilon^2)$, if $\|\mathbf{p} - \mathbf{q}\|_1 < \varepsilon d^{0.5 - Ω(η)}$. Here, $\mathbf{p}$ and $\mathbf{q}$ are the mean vectors of $P$ and $Q$ respectively, and no bound on $\|\mathbf{p} - \mathbf{q}\|_1$ is known to the algorithm a priori.

Conclusion: 提出的RFF-KPKM和IP-RFF-MKPKM方法有效解决了KPKM的可扩展性和鲁棒性问题，并提供了理论保证。

Abstract: Kernel power $k$-means (KPKM) leverages a family of means to mitigate local minima issues in kernel $k$-means. However, KPKM faces two key limitations: (1) the computational burden of the full kernel matrix restricts its use on extensive data, and (2) the lack of authentic centroid-sample assignment learning reduces its noise robustness. To overcome these challenges, we propose RFF-KPKM, introducing the first approximation theory for applying random Fourier features (RFF) to KPKM. RFF-KPKM employs RFF to generate efficient, low-dimensional feature maps, bypassing the need for the whole kernel matrix. Crucially, we are the first to establish strong theoretical guarantees for this combination: (1) an excess risk bound of $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{k^3/n})$, (2) strong consistency with membership values, and (3) a $(1+\varepsilon)$ relative error bound achievable using the RFF of dimension $\mathrm{poly}(\varepsilon^{-1}\log k)$. Furthermore, to improve robustness and the ability to learn multiple kernels, we propose IP-RFF-MKPKM, an improved possibilistic RFF-based multiple kernel power $k$-means. IP-RFF-MKPKM ensures the scalability of MKPKM via RFF and refines cluster assignments by combining the merits of the possibilistic membership and fuzzy membership. Experiments on large-scale datasets demonstrate the superior efficiency and clustering accuracy of the proposed methods compared to the state-of-the-art alternatives.

Abstract: Autonomous agents powered by large language models (LLMs) have the potential to significantly enhance human productivity by reasoning, using tools, and executing complex tasks in diverse environments. However, current approaches to developing such agents remain costly and inefficient, as they typically require manually constructed task datasets and reinforcement learning (RL) pipelines with extensive random exploration. These limitations lead to prohibitively high data-construction costs, low exploration efficiency, and poor sample utilization. To address these challenges, we present AgentEvolver, a self-evolving agent system that leverages the semantic understanding and reasoning capabilities of LLMs to drive autonomous agent learning. AgentEvolver introduces three synergistic mechanisms: (i) self-questioning, which enables curiosity-driven task generation in novel environments, reducing dependence on handcrafted datasets; (ii) self-navigating, which improves exploration efficiency through experience reuse and hybrid policy guidance; and (iii) self-attributing, which enhances sample efficiency by assigning differentiated rewards to trajectory states and actions based on their contribution. By integrating these mechanisms into a unified framework, AgentEvolver enables scalable, cost-effective, and continual improvement of agent capabilities. Preliminary experiments indicate that AgentEvolver achieves more efficient exploration, better sample utilization, and faster adaptation compared to traditional RL-based baselines.

Abstract: Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) rely on inherent fluctuations in their internal parameters (weights and biases) to effectively navigate the complex optimization landscape and achieve robust performance. While these fluctuations are recognized as crucial for escaping local minima and improving generalization, their precise relationship with fundamental hyperparameters remains underexplored. A significant knowledge gap exists concerning how the learning rate, a critical parameter governing the training process, directly influences the dynamics of these neural fluctuations. This study systematically investigates the impact of varying learning rates on the magnitude and character of weight and bias fluctuations within a neural network. We trained a model using distinct learning rates and analyzed the corresponding parameter fluctuations in conjunction with the network's final accuracy. Our findings aim to establish a clear link between the learning rate's value, the resulting fluctuation patterns, and overall model performance. By doing so, we provide deeper insights into the optimization process, shedding light on how the learning rate mediates the crucial exploration-exploitation trade-off during training. This work contributes to a more nuanced understanding of hyperparameter tuning and the underlying mechanics of deep learning.

Conclusion: 不确定性校准与基于扰动的解释质量密切相关，ReCalX方法能有效提升解释的可靠性而不改变模型原有预测性能。

Abstract: Perturbation-based explanations are widely utilized to enhance the transparency of machine-learning models in practice. However, their reliability is often compromised by the unknown model behavior under the specific perturbations used. This paper investigates the relationship between uncertainty calibration - the alignment of model confidence with actual accuracy - and perturbation-based explanations. We show that models systematically produce unreliable probability estimates when subjected to explainability-specific perturbations and theoretically prove that this directly undermines global and local explanation quality. To address this, we introduce ReCalX, a novel approach to recalibrate models for improved explanations while preserving their original predictions. Empirical evaluations across diverse models and datasets demonstrate that ReCalX consistently reduces perturbation-specific miscalibration most effectively while enhancing explanation robustness and the identification of globally important input features.

Abstract: Imbalance in classification tasks is commonly quantified by the cardinalities of examples across classes. This, however, disregards the presence of redundant examples and inherent differences in the learning difficulties of classes. Alternatively, one can use complex measures such as training loss and uncertainty, which, however, depend on training a machine learning model. Our paper proposes using data Intrinsic Dimensionality (ID) as an easy-to-compute, model-free measure of imbalance that can be seamlessly incorporated into various imbalance mitigation methods. Our results across five different datasets with a diverse range of imbalance ratios show that ID consistently outperforms cardinality-based re-weighting and re-sampling techniques used in the literature. Moreover, we show that combining ID with cardinality can further improve performance. Code: https://github.com/cagries/IDIM.

TL;DR: 提出了Panda方法，一种基于负数据增强的测试时自适应方法，通过生成破坏语义内容的负样本来抑制图像损坏相关特征，相比正数据增强方法计算开销更小且能有效缓解预测偏差。

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预训练的视觉语言模型在零样本分类中表现良好，但在图像损坏情况下预测性能显著下降。现有的测试时自适应方法采用正数据增强，但存在计算开销大和无法解决预测偏差的问题。

Method: Panda通过负数据增强生成破坏语义的图像：将图像分割成小块，从共享块池中随机重组生成负样本。这些负样本保留损坏特征但丢弃物体相关信号，然后从原始图像特征中减去负样本的平均特征来抑制损坏相关成分。

Result: Panda相比正数据增强方法性能更优，且能显著提升各种测试时自适应方法的鲁棒性。计算开销极小，因为增强可以在批次内跨样本共享。

Conclusion: Panda是一种有效的测试时自适应方法，能够在不增加显著计算成本的情况下，通过负数据增强有效抑制图像损坏带来的预测偏差，提升模型在分布偏移下的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Pretrained VLMs exhibit strong zero-shot classification capabilities, but their predictions degrade significantly under common image corruptions. To improve robustness, many test-time adaptation (TTA) methods adopt positive data augmentation (PDA), which generates multiple views of each test sample to reduce prediction variance. However, these methods suffer from two key limitations. First, it introduces considerable computational overhead due to the large number of augmentations required per image. Second, it fails to mitigate prediction bias, where the model tends to predict certain classes disproportionately under corruption, as PDA operates on corrupted inputs and typically does not remove the corruption itself. To address these challenges, we propose Panda, a novel TTA method based on negative data augmentation (NDA). Unlike positive augmentations that preserve object semantics, Panda generates negative augmentations by disrupting semantic content. It divides images into patches and randomly assembles them from a shared patch pool. These negatively augmented images retain corruption-specific features while discarding object-relevant signals. We then subtract the mean feature of these negative samples from the original image feature, effectively suppressing corruption-related components while preserving class-relevant information. This mitigates prediction bias under distribution shifts. Panda allows augmentation to be shared across samples within a batch, resulting in minimal computational overhead. Panda can be seamlessly integrated into existing test-time adaptation frameworks and substantially improve their robustness. Our experiments indicate that Panda delivers superior performance compared to PDA methods, and a wide range of TTA methods exhibit significantly enhanced performance when integrated with Panda.

Abstract: We propose loss function week enforcement of the velocity relations between time-series points in the Kinematic-Informed artificial Neural Networks (KINN) for long-term stock prediction. Problems of the series volatility, Out-of-Distribution (OOD) test data, and outliers in training data are addressed by (Artificial Neural Networks) ANN's learning not only future points prediction but also by learning velocity relations between the points, such a way as avoiding unrealistic spurious predictions. The presented loss function penalizes not only errors between predictions and supervised label data, but also errors between the next point prediction and the previous point plus velocity prediction. The loss function is tested on the multiple popular and exotic AR ANN architectures, and around fifteen years of Dow Jones function demonstrated statistically meaningful improvement across the normalization-sensitive activation functions prone to spurious behaviour in the OOD data conditions. Results show that such architecture addresses the issue of the normalization in the auto-regressive models that break the data topology by weakly enforcing the data neighbourhood proximity (relation) preservation during the ANN transformation.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出Holonorm作为Transformer中替代Tanh的归一化方法，解决了Tanh的正交性、线性和失真问题，具有残差连接和非线性特性，能防止激活爆炸并提高模型稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Tanh作为层归一化的替代方案存在正交性、线性和失真问题，导致其不可靠，因此需要开发更好的归一化方法。

Method: 提出Holonorm方法，具有残差连接和非线性特性，保持信号的正交性、方向和可逆性，将向量映射到单位开球内。

Result: Holonorm能有效防止激活爆炸，提高深度Transformer模型的稳定性，且其值在0到1之间便于理解和评估模型。

Conclusion: Holonorm是softsign函数的广义形式，适合作为Transformer中的归一化函数，比Tanh更可靠且易于理解。

Abstract: Normalization is a key point in transformer training . In Dynamic Tanh (DyT), the author demonstrated that Tanh can be used as an alternative layer normalization (LN) and confirmed the effectiveness of the idea. But Tanh itself faces orthogonality, linearity and distortion problems. Due to that, his proposition cannot be reliable. So we propose a Holonorm (hn) which has residual connections and nonlinearity. Holonorm is suitable for replacing Tanh in the context of normalization. Although the HoloNorm expression could be similar to the softsign function in dimension one, softsign is a componentwise function which is not good for tensors and vectors of great dimension. Holonorm preserves the orthogonality, the direction, the invertibility of the signal. Holonorm is also a suitable metric, maps all vectors into the open unit ball. This prevents exploding activations and improves stability in deep Transformer models. In this work, we have meticulously examined the normalization in transformers and say that Holonorm, a generalized form of softsign function suited as a normalization function first.Second, defined between 0 and 1 hn serves as a percentage, and $1 - \text{Holonorm}$ is its complement, making it better understandable in evaluating a model.

*Benjamin Yu,Vincenzo Lordi,Daniel Schwalbe-Koda*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于信息理论的原子数据集压缩框架，通过最小集合覆盖问题识别包含原始数据集最多信息的最小结构子集，在保持多样性和异常值的同时实现高效压缩。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机器学习原子间势能需要大规模训练数据集，但大数据集计算成本高，小数据集可能遗漏重要原子环境。需要一种能平衡准确性和成本的压缩方法。

Method: 将原子数据集压缩建模为最小集合覆盖问题，在原子中心环境上识别信息量最大的最小结构子集，去除冗余信息。

Result: 在GAP-20、TM23和64个ColabFit数据集上验证，MSC方法能保持异常值、数据集多样性和力的长尾分布，在压缩率较高时仍优于其他子采样方法。

Conclusion: MSC压缩的训练数据集能降低分布外数据的误差，算法已开源实现，可用于数据子采样、异常检测和低成本训练改进的MLIPs。

Abstract: Machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) balance high accuracy and lower costs compared to density functional theory calculations, but their performance often depends on the size and diversity of training datasets. Large datasets improve model accuracy and generalization but are computationally expensive to produce and train on, while smaller datasets risk discarding rare but important atomic environments and compromising MLIP accuracy/reliability. Here, we develop an information-theoretical framework to quantify the efficiency of dataset compression methods and propose an algorithm that maximizes this efficiency. By framing atomistic dataset compression as an instance of the minimum set cover (MSC) problem over atom-centered environments, our method identifies the smallest subset of structures that contains as much information as possible from the original dataset while pruning redundant information. The approach is extensively demonstrated on the GAP-20 and TM23 datasets, and validated on 64 varied datasets from the ColabFit repository. Across all cases, MSC consistently retains outliers, preserves dataset diversity, and reproduces the long-tail distributions of forces even at high compression rates, outperforming other subsampling methods. Furthermore, MLIPs trained on MSC-compressed datasets exhibit reduced error for out-of-distribution data even in low-data regimes. We explain these results using an outlier analysis and show that such quantitative conclusions could not be achieved with conventional dimensionality reduction methods. The algorithm is implemented in the open-source QUESTS package and can be used for several tasks in atomistic modeling, from data subsampling, outlier detection, and training improved MLIPs at a lower cost.

TL;DR: Oya是一种利用地球静止卫星可见光和红外全光谱观测的新型实时降水反演算法，采用两阶段深度学习方法，在降水检测和定量降水估计方面优于现有基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 全球南方地区地面观测网络稀疏且预报能力有限，现有卫星降水产品主要依赖长波红外通道或使用可能引入显著误差的校准数据，特别是在次日时间尺度上。

Method: 采用两阶段深度学习框架，结合两个U-Net模型：一个用于降水检测，另一个用于定量降水估计，以解决雨和无雨事件之间的数据不平衡问题。使用GPM CORRA v07高分辨率数据作为地面真值，并在IMERG-Final反演数据上进行预训练以增强鲁棒性。

Result: 通过利用多个地球静止卫星，Oya实现了准全球覆盖，并在性能上优于现有的竞争性区域和全球降水基线方法。

Conclusion: Oya为改进降水监测和预报提供了一条有前景的途径。

Abstract: Accurate precipitation estimation is critical for hydrological applications, especially in the Global South where ground-based observation networks are sparse and forecasting skill is limited. Existing satellite-based precipitation products often rely on the longwave infrared channel alone or are calibrated with data that can introduce significant errors, particularly at sub-daily timescales. This study introduces Oya, a novel real-time precipitation retrieval algorithm utilizing the full spectrum of visible and infrared (VIS-IR) observations from geostationary (GEO) satellites. Oya employs a two-stage deep learning approach, combining two U-Net models: one for precipitation detection and another for quantitative precipitation estimation (QPE), to address the inherent data imbalance between rain and no-rain events. The models are trained using high-resolution GPM Combined Radar-Radiometer Algorithm (CORRA) v07 data as ground truth and pre-trained on IMERG-Final retrievals to enhance robustness and mitigate overfitting due to the limited temporal sampling of CORRA. By leveraging multiple GEO satellites, Oya achieves quasi-global coverage and demonstrates superior performance compared to existing competitive regional and global precipitation baselines, offering a promising pathway to improved precipitation monitoring and forecasting.

Motivation: 研究LayerNorm在Pre-LayerNorm和Post-LayerNorm transformer架构中对学习和记忆的影响差异。

Method: 通过分析13个模型在6个视觉和语言数据集上的表现，研究移除LayerNorm参数对学习和记忆的影响。

Result: 在Pre-LayerNorm模型中移除LayerNorm会加剧记忆化并破坏学习稳定性，而在Post-LayerNorm模型中移除LayerNorm能有效缓解记忆化。早期层的LayerNorm最为关键。

Conclusion: LayerNorm在transformer中塑造记忆和学习方面发挥着重要作用，其影响因架构类型而异。

Abstract: Layer Normalization (LayerNorm) is one of the fundamental components in transformers that stabilizes training and improves optimization. In recent times, Pre-LayerNorm transformers have become the preferred choice over Post-LayerNorm transformers due to their stable gradient flow. However, the impact of LayerNorm on learning and memorization across these architectures remains unclear. In this work, we investigate how LayerNorm influences memorization and learning for Pre- and Post-LayerNorm transformers. We identify that LayerNorm serves as a key factor for stable learning in Pre-LayerNorm transformers, while in Post-LayerNorm transformers, it impacts memorization. Our analysis reveals that eliminating LayerNorm parameters in Pre-LayerNorm models exacerbates memorization and destabilizes learning, while in Post-LayerNorm models, it effectively mitigates memorization by restoring genuine labels. We further precisely identify that early layers LayerNorm are the most critical over middle/later layers and their influence varies across Pre and Post LayerNorm models. We have validated it through 13 models across 6 Vision and Language datasets. These insights shed new light on the role of LayerNorm in shaping memorization and learning in transformers.

TL;DR: 提出Belief Net框架，通过将HMM前向滤波构建为结构化神经网络，使用梯度优化学习HMM参数，比Baum-Welch算法收敛更快，在过完备和欠完备设置下都能成功恢复参数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统HMM参数学习方法如Baum-Welch算法计算量大且易陷入局部最优，而现代谱算法虽有可证明保证但可能产生无效概率输出，需要一种更高效可靠的方法。

Method: 将HMM前向滤波构建为结构化神经网络，可学习权重明确对应初始分布、转移矩阵和发射矩阵的对数几率，采用仅解码器架构处理观测序列，使用标准自回归下一观测预测损失进行端到端训练。

Result: 在合成HMM数据上，Belief Net比Baum-Welch收敛速度更快，在谱方法失败的过完备和欠完备设置下都能成功恢复参数，并在真实语言数据上与Transformer模型进行了比较。

Conclusion: Belief Net提供了一种通过梯度优化学习HMM参数的有效方法，具有完全可解释性，在多种设置下优于传统方法。

Abstract: Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) are fundamental for modeling sequential data, yet learning their parameters from observations remains challenging. Classical methods like the Baum-Welch (EM) algorithm are computationally intensive and prone to local optima, while modern spectral algorithms offer provable guarantees but may produce probability outputs outside valid ranges. This work introduces Belief Net, a novel framework that learns HMM parameters through gradient-based optimization by formulating the HMM's forward filter as a structured neural network. Unlike black-box Transformer models, Belief Net's learnable weights are explicitly the logits of the initial distribution, transition matrix, and emission matrix, ensuring full interpretability. The model processes observation sequences using a decoder-only architecture and is trained end-to-end with standard autoregressive next-observation prediction loss. On synthetic HMM data, Belief Net achieves superior convergence speed compared to Baum-Welch, successfully recovering parameters in both undercomplete and overcomplete settings where spectral methods fail. Comparisons with Transformer-based models are also presented on real-world language data.

Conclusion: 该框架在机器学习策略优化中实现了同理心和责任的操作化，为行为健康、教育和数字疗法等领域的人本化系统提供了方法论基础。

Abstract: Personalized decision systems in healthcare and behavioral support often rely on static rule-based or engagement-maximizing heuristics that overlook users' emotional context and ethical constraints. Such approaches risk recommending insensitive or unsafe interventions, especially in domains involving serious mental illness, substance use disorders, or depression. To address this limitation, we propose a Responsible Reinforcement Learning (RRL) framework that integrates emotional and contextual understanding with ethical considerations into the sequential decision-making process. RRL formulates personalization as a Constrained Markov Decision Process (CMDP), where the agent optimizes engagement and adherence while ensuring emotional alignment and ethical safety. We introduce a multi-objective reward function that explicitly balances short-term behavioral engagement with long-term user well-being, and define an emotion-informed state representation that captures fluctuations in emotional readiness, affect, and risk. The proposed architecture can be instantiated with any RL algorithm (e.g., DQN, PPO) augmented with safety constraints or Lagrangian regularization. Conceptually, this framework operationalizes empathy and responsibility within machine learning policy optimization, bridging safe RL, affective computing and responsible AI. We discuss the implications of this approach for human-centric domains such as behavioral health, education, and digital therapeutics, and outline simulation-based validation paths for future empirical work. This paper aims to initiate a methodological conversation about ethically aligned reinforcement learning for emotionally aware and trustworthy personalization systems.

Conclusion: 提出的LC-KSVD2 + LISTA/LISTAConv流水线为现代深度架构提供了一个可解释且计算高效的替代方案。

Abstract: We present a semi-unified sparse dictionary learning framework that bridges the gap between classical sparse models and modern deep architectures. Specifically, the method integrates strict Top-$K$ LISTA and its convex FISTA-based variant (LISTAConv) into the discriminative LC-KSVD2 model, enabling co-evolution between the sparse encoder and the dictionary under supervised or unsupervised regimes. This unified design retains the interpretability of traditional sparse coding while benefiting from efficient, differentiable training.
  We further establish a PALM-style convergence analysis for the convex variant, ensuring theoretical stability under block alternation. Experimentally, our method achieves 95.6\% on CIFAR-10, 86.3\% on CIFAR-100, and 88.5\% on TinyImageNet with faster convergence and lower memory cost ($<$4GB GPU). The results confirm that the proposed LC-KSVD2 + LISTA/LISTAConv pipeline offers an interpretable and computationally efficient alternative for modern deep architectures.

Motivation: 现有的局部鲁棒性验证器主要依赖线性边界传播来处理凸扰动空间，但少数像素攻击的ℓ₀-ball扰动空间是非凸的，这给验证带来了挑战。

Method: 证明了ℓ₀-ball的凸包是其边界框与不对称缩放ℓ₁-like多面体的交集，并开发了一种精确计算凸包边界的线性边界传播方法。

Result: 该方法在最具挑战性的鲁棒性基准测试中，将最先进的ℓ₀验证器的性能提升了1.24倍到7.07倍，几何平均提升为3.16倍。

Conclusion: 通过精确建模ℓ₀-ball的凸包特性，提出的线性边界传播方法能够有效处理非凸扰动空间，显著提升了神经网络对少数像素攻击的鲁棒性验证能力。

Abstract: Few-pixel attacks mislead a classifier by modifying a few pixels of an image. Their perturbation space is an $\ell_0$-ball, which is not convex, unlike $\ell_p$-balls for $p\geq1$. However, existing local robustness verifiers typically scale by relying on linear bound propagation, which captures convex perturbation spaces. We show that the convex hull of an $\ell_0$-ball is the intersection of its bounding box and an asymmetrically scaled $\ell_1$-like polytope. The volumes of the convex hull and this polytope are nearly equal as the input dimension increases. We then show a linear bound propagation that precisely computes bounds over the convex hull and is significantly tighter than bound propagations over the bounding box or our $\ell_1$-like polytope. This bound propagation scales the state-of-the-art $\ell_0$ verifier on its most challenging robustness benchmarks by 1.24x-7.07x, with a geometric mean of 3.16.

Abstract: Batched synthesis and testing of molecular designs is the key bottleneck of drug development. There has been great interest in leveraging biomolecular foundation models as surrogates to accelerate this process. In this work, we show how to obtain scalable probabilistic surrogates of binding affinity for use in Batch Bayesian Optimization (Batch BO). This demands parallel acquisition functions that hedge between designs and the ability to rapidly sample from a joint predictive density to approximate them. Through the framework of Epistemic Neural Networks (ENNs), we obtain scalable joint predictive distributions of binding affinity on top of representations taken from large structure-informed models. Key to this work is an investigation into the importance of prior networks in ENNs and how to pretrain them on synthetic data to improve downstream performance in Batch BO. Their utility is demonstrated by rediscovering known potent EGFR inhibitors on a semi-synthetic benchmark in up to 5x fewer iterations, as well as potent inhibitors from a real-world small-molecule library in up to 10x fewer iterations, offering a promising solution for large-scale drug discovery applications.

Abstract: The improving multi-armed bandits problem is a formal model for allocating effort under uncertainty, motivated by scenarios such as investing research effort into new technologies, performing clinical trials, and hyperparameter selection from learning curves. Each pull of an arm provides reward that increases monotonically with diminishing returns. A growing line of work has designed algorithms for improving bandits, albeit with somewhat pessimistic worst-case guarantees. Indeed, strong lower bounds of $Ω(k)$ and $Ω(\sqrt{k})$ multiplicative approximation factors are known for both deterministic and randomized algorithms (respectively) relative to the optimal arm, where $k$ is the number of bandit arms. In this work, we propose two new parameterized families of bandit algorithms and bound the sample complexity of learning the near-optimal algorithm from each family using offline data. The first family we define includes the optimal randomized algorithm from prior work. We show that an appropriately chosen algorithm from this family can achieve stronger guarantees, with optimal dependence on $k$, when the arm reward curves satisfy additional properties related to the strength of concavity. Our second family contains algorithms that both guarantee best-arm identification on well-behaved instances and revert to worst case guarantees on poorly-behaved instances. Taking a statistical learning perspective on the bandit rewards optimization problem, we achieve stronger data-dependent guarantees without the need for actually verifying whether the assumptions are satisfied.

Abstract: Resource orchestration and configuration parameter search are key concerns for container-based infrastructure in cloud data centers. Large configuration search space and cloud uncertainties are often mitigated using contextual bandit techniques for resource orchestration including the state-of-the-art Drone orchestrator. Complexity in the cloud provider environment due to varying numbers of virtual machines introduces variability in workloads and resource metrics, making orchestration decisions less accurate due to increased nonlinearity and noise. Ksurf, a state-of-the-art variance-minimizing estimator method ideal for highly variable cloud data, enables optimal resource estimation under conditions of high cloud variability.
  This work evaluates the performance of Ksurf on estimation-based resource orchestration tasks involving highly variable workloads when employed as a contextual multi-armed bandit objective function model for cloud scenarios using Drone. Ksurf enables significantly lower latency variance of $41\%$ at p95 and $47\%$ at p99, demonstrates a $4\%$ reduction in CPU usage and 7 MB reduction in master node memory usage on Kubernetes, resulting in a $7\%$ cost savings in average worker pod count on VarBench Kubernetes benchmark.

Abstract: Transaction scheduling is crucial to efficiently allocate shared resources in a conflict-free manner in distributed systems. We investigate the efficient scheduling of transactions in a network of fog-cloud computing model, where transactions and their associated shared objects can move within the network. The schedule may require objects to move to transaction nodes, or the transactions to move to the object nodes. Moreover, the schedule may determine intermediate nodes where both objects and transactions meet. Our goal is to minimize the total combined cost of the schedule. We focus on networks of constant doubling dimension, which appear frequently in practice. We consider a batch problem where an arbitrary set of nodes has transactions that need to be scheduled. First, we consider a single shared object required by all the transactions and present a scheduling algorithm that gives an $O(\log n \cdot \log D)$ approximation of the optimal schedule, where $n$ is the number of nodes and $D$ is the diameter of the network. Later, we consider transactions accessing multiple shared objects (at most $k$ objects per transaction) and provide a scheduling algorithm that gives an $O(k \cdot \log n \cdot \log D)$ approximation. We also provide a fully distributed version of the scheduling algorithms where the nodes do not need global knowledge of transactions.

Abstract: The exponential growth in LLM scales, with parameters soaring from billions to trillions, has necessitated distributed pretraining across large clusters comprising thousands to tens of thousands of devices. While hybrid parallelization strategies enable such pretraining, the vast combinatorial strategy space introduces significant optimization challenges. Traditional manual tuning methods incur prohibitive trial-and-error costs, and existing performance modeling approaches exhibit critical limitations: they fail to comprehensively account for prevalent optimization features and ignore the substantial overhead imposed by essential fault tolerance mechanisms like checkpoint recovery in long-duration pretraining. To address these gaps, we propose MoFa, a novel pretraining performance modeling framework that unifies multi-dimensional optimization features and fault tolerance. MoFa incorporates an enhanced cost model to accurately capture the effects of key optimizations and integrates a fault tolerance model based on historical cluster reliability data. Besides, a MoFa-based tuning system is developed to explore optimal pretraining performance and potential bottlenecks in various scenarios. Extensive modeling evaluations demonstrate that MoFa can achieve high prediction accuracy across various scenarios. In addition, through comprehensive tuning experiments, our framework systematically reveals the key factors influencing pretraining performance under different configurations, which provides solid a priori guidance for LLM pretraining system design and deployment.

Such performance variation significantly impacts both high-performance computing and artificial intelligence workloads, such as cutting-edge large language models (LLMs). We analyze the performance of a single-node multi-GPU system running LLM training, and observe that the kernel-level performance variation is highly correlated with concurrent computation communication (C3), a technique to overlap computation and communication across GPUs for performance gains. We then take a further step to reason that thermally induced straggling coupling with C3 impacts performance variation, coined as the Lit Silicon effect. Lit Silicon describes that in a multi-GPU node, thermal imbalance across GPUs introduces node-level straggler GPUs, which in turn slow down the leader GPUs. Lit Silicon leads to node-level performance variation and inefficiency, impacting the entire datacenter from the bottom up. We propose analytical performance and power models for Lit Silicon, to understand the potential system-level gains. We further design simple detection and mitigation techniques to effectively address the Lit Silicon problem, and evaluate three different power management solutions, including power optimization under GPU thermal design power, performance optimization under node-level GPU power capping, and performance optimization under node-level CPU power sloshing. We conduct experiments on two workloads on two AMD InstinctTM MI300X GPU systems under two LLM training frameworks, and observe up to 6% performance and 4% power improvements, potentially saving hundreds of millions of dollars in datacenters. Our solution is almost free lunch and can be effortlessly adopted in datacenters as a new node-level power management layer.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 云虚拟机中的缓存优化通常无效，因为虚拟机无法了解和控制缓存配置细节，如CPU缓存分区和内存到缓存的映射。

Result: 在x86 Linux内核中实现的CacheX评估表明，它能有效提高公共云虚拟机中各种工作负载的缓存利用率。

Conclusion: CacheX提供了一种无需硬件或虚拟机监控程序支持的解决方案，能够有效改善云虚拟机中的缓存利用效率。

Abstract: This paper shows that cache-based optimizations are often ineffective in cloud virtual machines (VMs) due to limited visibility into and control over provisioned caches. In public clouds, CPU caches can be partitioned or shared among VMs, but a VM is unaware of cache provisioning details. Moreover, a VM cannot influence cache usage via page placement policies, as memory-to-cache mappings are hidden. The paper proposes a novel solution, CacheX, which probes accurate and fine-grained cache abstraction within VMs using eviction sets without requiring hardware or hypervisor support, and showcases the utility of the probed information with two new techniques: LLC contention-aware task scheduling and virtual color-aware page cache management. Our evaluation of CacheX's implementation in x86 Linux kernel demonstrates that it can effectively improve cache utilization for various workloads in public cloud VMs.

Result: MO-HAN在降低平均和尾部延迟方面持续优于静态和公平分配基准方法，同时相比纯机会选择减少了近50%的切换次数。

Conclusion: MO-HAN无需侵入式检测或重型学习基础设施，适用于资源受限的嵌入式设备，实现了延迟降低和切换优化的双重目标。

Abstract: Latency-sensitive embedded applications increasingly rely on edge computing, yet dynamic network congestion in multi-server architectures challenges proper edge server selection. This paper proposes a lightweight server-selection method for edge applications that fuses latency prediction with adaptive reliability and hysteresis-based handover. Using passive measurements (arrival rate, utilization, payload size) and an exponentially modulated rational delay model, the proposed Moderate Handover (MO-HAN) method computes a score that balances predicted latency and reliability to ensure handovers occur only when the expected gain is meaningful and maintain reduced end-to-end latency. Results show that MO-HAN consistently outperforms static and fair-distribution baselines by lowering mean and tail latencies, while reducing handovers by nearly 50% compared to pure opportunistic selection. These gains arise without intrusive instrumentation or heavy learning infrastructure, making MO-HAN practical for resource-constrained embedded devices.

Abstract: Sparse matrix ordering is a vital optimization technique often employed for solving large-scale sparse matrices. Its goal is to minimize the matrix bandwidth by reorganizing its rows and columns, thus enhancing efficiency. Conventional methods for algorithm selection usually depend on brute-force search or empirical knowledge, lacking the ability to adjust to diverse sparse matrix structures.As a result, we have introduced a supervised learning-based model for choosing sparse matrix reordering algorithms. This model grasps the correlation between matrix characteristics and commonly utilized reordering algorithms, facilitating the automated and intelligent selection of the suitable sparse matrix reordering algorithm. Experiments conducted on the Florida sparse matrix dataset reveal that our model can accurately predict the optimal reordering algorithm for various matrices, leading to a 55.37% reduction in solution time compared to solely using the AMD reordering algorithm, with an average speedup ratio of 1.45.

Abstract: Optimizing the performance of large language models (LLMs) on large-scale AI training and inference systems requires a scalable and expressive mechanism to model distributed workload execution. Such modeling is essential for pre-deployment system-level optimizations (e.g., parallelization strategies) and design-space explorations. While recent efforts have proposed collecting execution traces from real systems, access to large-scale infrastructure remains limited to major cloud providers. Moreover, traces obtained from existing platforms cannot be easily adapted to study future larger-scale system configurations. We introduce Symbolic Tensor grAph GEnerator(STAGE), a framework that synthesizes high-fidelity execution traces to accurately model LLM workloads. STAGE supports a comprehensive set of parallelization strategies, allowing users to systematically explore a wide spectrum of LLM architectures and system configurations. STAGE demonstrates its scalability by synthesizing high-fidelity LLM traces spanning over 32K GPUs, while preserving tensor-level accuracy in compute, memory, and communication. STAGE will be publicly available to facilitate further research in distributed machine learning systems.
