### [1] [On the energy efficiency of sparse matrix computations on multi-GPU clusters](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02878)
*Massimo Bernaschi,Alessandro Celestini,Pasqua D'Ambra,Giorgio Richelli*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: 该论文研究了一个用于稀疏矩阵并行计算库的能效性能，展示了该库在GPU加速器上的高能效表现，并提供了详细的能耗分析结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着现代高性能计算平台对可持续性要求的日益增长，需要评估和优化计算库的能源效率，而不仅仅是性能效率。

Method: 开发了用于准确测量库核心组件运行时能耗的方法和工具，通过优化GPU计算和最小化跨内存和计算节点的数据移动来提高能效。

Result: 结果表明，优化GPU计算和减少数据移动既能缩短求解时间又能降低能耗，该库在标准基准测试中相比同类软件框架具有显著优势。

Conclusion: 该稀疏矩阵并行计算库不仅性能高效，而且能效优越，能够满足现代HPC平台的可持续性要求，通过算法优化实现了性能与能耗的双重改善。

Abstract: We investigate the energy efficiency of a library designed for parallel
computations with sparse matrices. The library leverages high-performance,
energy-efficient Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) accelerators to enable
large-scale scientific applications. Our primary development objective was to
maximize parallel performance and scalability in solving sparse linear systems
whose dimensions far exceed the memory capacity of a single node. To this end,
we devised methods that expose a high degree of parallelism while optimizing
algorithmic implementations for efficient multi-GPU usage. Previous work has
already demonstrated the library's performance efficiency on large-scale
systems comprising thousands of NVIDIA GPUs, achieving improvements over
state-of-the-art solutions. In this paper, we extend those results by providing
energy profiles that address the growing sustainability requirements of modern
HPC platforms. We present our methodology and tools for accurate runtime energy
measurements of the library's core components and discuss the findings. Our
results confirm that optimizing GPU computations and minimizing data movement
across memory and computing nodes reduces both time-to-solution and energy
consumption. Moreover, we show that the library delivers substantial advantages
over comparable software frameworks on standard benchmarks.

*Gursimran Singh,Timothy Yu,Haley Li,Cheng Chen,Hanieh Sadri,Qintao Zhang,Yu Zhang,Ying Xiong,Yong Zhang,Zhenan Fan*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: ElasticMoE是一个用于MoE大语言模型的弹性扩展框架，通过解耦推理执行和内存操作，实现细粒度、低延迟、零停机的扩展，解决了现有扩展策略在突发流量模式下的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的MoE模型扩展策略存在粒度粗、延迟长、成本高的问题，无法适应云部署中常见的突发性、短时流量模式。水平扩展需要复制整个配置，垂直扩展需要重启实例，都难以实现高效的弹性扩展。

Method: ElasticMoE通过解耦推理执行和内存操作实现并发扩展；使用HBM管理模块通过零拷贝重映射复用权重和KV缓存；采用点对点传输在线添加加速器；基于虚拟内存的专家重分配机制迁移MoE专家，避免昂贵的缓冲区重新分配。

Result: 在Ascend NPU上的评估显示，ElasticMoE相比基线实现了高达9倍的扩展延迟降低、高达2倍的扩展期间吞吐量提升，并显著改善了SLO达成率。

Conclusion: ElasticMoE通过实现细粒度、并发的扩展且干扰最小，提升了在动态云环境中部署大规模MoE LLM的实用性。

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models promise efficient scaling of large language
models (LLMs) by activating only a small subset of experts per token, but their
parallelized inference pipelines make elastic serving challenging. Existing
strategies fall short: horizontal scaling provisions entire replicas of the
current configuration, often tens to hundreds of accelerators, leading to
coarse granularity, long provisioning delays, and costly overprovisioning.
Vertical scaling offers finer adjustments but typically requires instance
restarts, incurring downtime. These limitations make current approaches
ill-suited for the bursty, short-lived traffic patterns common in cloud
deployments.
  We present ElasticMoE, an elastic scaling framework for MoE LLMs that
achieves fine-grained, low-latency, and zero-downtime scaling. ElasticMoE
decouples inference execution from memory operations, enabling scaling steps to
proceed concurrently with serving. An HBM Management Module (HMM) reuses
weights and KV caches via zero-copy remapping, while high-bandwidth
peer-to-peer transfers bring newly added accelerators online without
interrupting service. A virtual memory based expert redistribution mechanism
migrates MoE experts without costly buffer reallocations, reducing peak memory
usage during expert parallelism reconfiguration.
  Our evaluation on Ascend NPUs with three popular MoE LLMs shows that
ElasticMoE achieves up to 9x lower scale-up latency, up to 2x better throughput
during scaling, and significantly improves SLO attainment compared to
baselines. By enabling fine-grained, concurrent scaling with minimal
disruption, ElasticMoE advances the practicality of deploying massive MoE LLMs
in dynamic cloud environments.

### [3] [GRNND: A GPU-Parallel Relative NN-Descent Algorithm for Efficient Approximate Nearest Neighbor Graph Construction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02774)
*Xiang Li,Qiong Chang,Yun Li,Jun Miyazaki*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: GRNND是首个针对RNN-Descent的GPU并行算法，通过无序邻居传播策略和GPU架构优化，显著提升了大规模高维数据下近似最近邻图的构建效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着数据量和维度的增加，RNN-Descent在图构建阶段的复杂度急剧上升，变得非常耗时，甚至影响后续查询处理。

Method: GRNND引入无序邻居传播策略缓解同步更新陷阱，利用warp级协作操作和双缓冲邻居池进行高效内存访问，实现高度并行化的邻居更新。

Result: GRNND在实验中持续优于现有CPU和GPU方法，相比GPU方法获得2.4到51.7倍加速，相比CPU方法获得17.8到49.8倍加速。

Conclusion: GRNND成功解决了RNN-Descent在大规模高维数据下的性能瓶颈，为近似最近邻图构建提供了高效的GPU并行解决方案。

Abstract: Relative Nearest Neighbor Descent (RNN-Descent) is a state-of-the-art
algorithm for constructing sparse approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) graphs by
combining the iterative refinement of NN-Descent with the edge-pruning rules of
the Relative Neighborhood Graph (RNG). It has demonstrated strong effectiveness
in large-scale search tasks such as information retrieval and related tasks.
However, as the amount and dimensionality of data increase, the complexity of
graph construction in RNN-Descent rises sharply, making this stage increasingly
time-consuming and even prohibitive for subsequent query processing. In this
paper, we propose GRNND, the first GPU-parallel algorithm of RNN-Descent
designed to fully exploit GPU architecture. GRNND introduces a disordered
neighbor propagation strategy to mitigate synchronized update traps, enhancing
structural diversity, and avoiding premature convergence during parallel
execution. It also leverages warp-level cooperative operations and a
double-buffered neighbor pool with fixed capacity for efficient memory access,
eliminate contention, and enable highly parallelized neighbor updates.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that GRNND consistently outperforms existing
CPU- and GPU-based methods. GRNND achieves 2.4 to 51.7x speedup over existing
GPU methods, and 17.8 to 49.8x speedup over CPU methods.

### [4] [TridentServe: A Stage-level Serving System for Diffusion Pipelines](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02838)
*Yifei Xia,Fangcheng Fu,Hao Yuan,Hanke Zhang,Xupeng Miao,Yijun Liu,Suhan Ling,Jie Jiang,Bin Cui*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: TridentServe是一个动态阶段级扩散模型服务系统，通过自动优化模型部署和请求路由，显著提升服务效率和延迟性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有扩散管道服务系统采用静态、手动、管道级的资源分配模式，无法适应不同阶段和请求的资源需求差异，导致效率低下。

Method: 提出动态阶段级服务范式，自动推导管道部署的放置计划和请求处理的分发计划，协同优化模型和请求的资源分配。

Result: 实验表明，TridentServe在各种工作负载下，相比现有方法，SLO达成率提升2.5倍，平均/P95延迟降低3.6倍/4.1倍。

Conclusion: 动态阶段级服务范式能有效解决扩散管道服务中的资源分配不匹配问题，显著提升系统性能。

Abstract: Diffusion pipelines, renowned for their powerful visual generation
capabilities, have seen widespread adoption in generative vision tasks (e.g.,
text-to-image/video). These pipelines typically follow an
encode--diffuse--decode three-stage architecture. Current serving systems
deploy diffusion pipelines within a static, manual, and pipeline-level
paradigm, allocating the same resources to every request and stage. However,
through an in-depth analysis, we find that such a paradigm is inefficient due
to the discrepancy in resource needs across the three stages of each request,
as well as across different requests. Following the analysis, we propose the
dynamic stage-level serving paradigm and develop TridentServe, a brand new
diffusion serving system. TridentServe automatically, dynamically derives the
placement plan (i.e., how each stage resides) for pipeline deployment and the
dispatch plan (i.e., how the requests are routed) for request processing,
co-optimizing the resource allocation for both model and requests. Extensive
experiments show that TridentServe consistently improves SLO attainment and
reduces average/P95 latencies by up to 2.5x and 3.6x/4.1x over existing works
across a variety of workloads.

### [5] [Energy Efficiency in Cloud-Based Big Data Processing for Earth Observation: Gap Analysis and Future Directions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02882)
*Adhitya Bhawiyuga,Serkan Girgin,Rolf A. de By,Raul Zurita-Milla*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: 本文分析了云处理地球观测大数据(EOBD)中的能源效率问题，识别了现有平台在能源监测、数据管理、资源分配和任务调度方面的不足，并提出了改进方向。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着地球观测数据量的快速增长和云计算的广泛应用，能源效率和碳足迹问题日益突出，但现有EOBD处理平台主要关注数据可访问性和计算可行性，忽视了能源效率。

Method: 通过分析当前EOBD处理现状和需求，调查其他大数据领域成功的能源效率策略，识别EOBD平台在能源效率方面的关键差距。

Result: 识别出四个主要差距：能源监测机制不足、数据管理缺乏能源意识、资源分配未充分考虑能源效率、任务调度缺少能源效率标准。

Conclusion: 提出了开发能源感知性能监测框架、优化基础设施编排技术、采用能源高效任务调度方法等研究方向，以在保持处理性能的同时降低能耗和环境影

Abstract: Earth observation (EO) data volumes are rapidly increasing. While cloud
computing are now used for processing large EO datasets, the energy efficiency
aspects of such a processing have received much less attention. This issue is
notable given the increasing awareness of energy costs and carbon footprint in
big data processing, particularly with increased attention on compute-intensive
foundation models. In this paper we identify gaps in energy efficiency
practices within cloud-based EO big data (EOBD) processing and propose several
research directions for improvement. We first examine the current EOBD
landscape, focus on the requirements that necessitate cloud-based processing
and analyze existing cloud-based EOBD solutions. We then investigate energy
efficiency strategies that have been successfully employed in well-studied big
data domains. Through this analysis, we identify several critical gaps in
existing EOBD processing platforms, which primarily focus on data accessibility
and computational feasibility, instead of energy efficiency. These gaps include
insufficient energy monitoring mechanisms, lack of energy awareness in data
management, inadequate implementation of energy-aware resource allocation and
lack of energy efficiency criteria on task scheduling. Based on these findings,
we propose the development of energy-aware performance monitoring and
benchmarking frameworks, the use of optimization techniques for infrastructure
orchestration, and of energy-efficient task scheduling approaches for
distributed cloud-based EOBD processing frameworks. These proposed approaches
aim to foster more energy awareness in EOBD processing , potentially reducing
power consumption and environmental impact while maintaining or minimally
impacting processing performance.

Abstract: The intelligent Distributed Dispatch and Scheduling (iDDS) service is a
versatile workflow orchestration system designed for large-scale, distributed
scientific computing. iDDS extends traditional workload and data management by
integrating data-aware execution, conditional logic, and programmable
workflows, enabling automation of complex and dynamic processing pipelines.
Originally developed for the ATLAS experiment at the Large Hadron Collider,
iDDS has evolved into an experiment-agnostic platform that supports both
template-driven workflows and a Function-as-a-Task model for Python-based
orchestration.
  This paper presents the architecture and core components of iDDS,
highlighting its scalability, modular message-driven design, and integration
with systems such as PanDA and Rucio. We demonstrate its versatility through
real-world use cases: fine-grained tape resource optimization for ATLAS,
orchestration of large Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) workflows for the Rubin
Observatory, distributed hyperparameter optimization for machine learning
applications, active learning for physics analyses, and AI-assisted detector
design at the Electron-Ion Collider.
  By unifying workload scheduling, data movement, and adaptive decision-making,
iDDS reduces operational overhead and enables reproducible, high-throughput
workflows across heterogeneous infrastructures. We conclude with current
challenges and future directions, including interactive, cloud-native, and
serverless workflow support.

### [8] [Extreme value forecasting using relevance-based data augmentation with deep learning models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02407)
*Junru Hua,Rahul Ahluwalia,Rohitash Chandra*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出一个用于极端值预测的数据增强框架，结合GAN和SMOTE等数据增强技术与Conv-LSTM、BD-LSTM深度学习模型，发现SMOTE策略在极端值预测中表现最佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决极端值预测这一具有挑战性的问题，该问题在金融和气候变化等领域有广泛应用，但传统方法在处理极端值时存在困难。

Method: 使用GAN和SMOTE进行数据增强，结合Conv-LSTM和BD-LSTM深度学习模型进行多步预测，并基于相关性函数提出新的数据增强策略。

Result: SMOTE策略在短期和长期预测中均表现出最佳适应性；Conv-LSTM在周期性稳定数据中表现优异，BD-LSTM在混沌或非平稳序列中表现更好。

Conclusion: 数据增强特别是SMOTE策略能有效提升极端值预测性能，不同深度学习模型在不同类型数据中具有互补优势。

Abstract: Data augmentation with generative adversarial networks (GANs) has been
popular for class imbalance problems, mainly for pattern classification and
computer vision-related applications. Extreme value forecasting is a
challenging field that has various applications from finance to climate change
problems. In this study, we present a data augmentation framework for extreme
value forecasting. In this framework, our focus is on forecasting extreme
values using deep learning models in combination with data augmentation models
such as GANs and synthetic minority oversampling technique (SMOTE). We use deep
learning models such as convolutional long short-term memory (Conv-LSTM) and
bidirectional long short-term memory (BD-LSTM) networks for multistep ahead
prediction featuring extremes. We investigate which data augmentation models
are the most suitable, taking into account the prediction accuracy overall and
at extreme regions, along with computational efficiency. We also present novel
strategies for incorporating data augmentation, considering extreme values
based on a relevance function. Our results indicate that the SMOTE-based
strategy consistently demonstrated superior adaptability, leading to improved
performance across both short- and long-horizon forecasts. Conv-LSTM and
BD-LSTM exhibit complementary strengths: the former excels in periodic, stable
datasets, while the latter performs better in chaotic or non-stationary
sequences.

TL;DR: OpenTSLM是一个时间序列语言模型家族，通过将时间序列作为原生模态集成到预训练LLMs中，实现了对任意长度多时间序列的推理。包含两种架构：SoftPrompt（隐式建模）和Flamingo（显式建模），在多个医疗时间序列推理任务中显著优于基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLMs无法处理时间序列数据的限制，特别是在医疗领域需要合成大量临床信息生成可操作洞察的应用场景。

Method: 开发了两种架构：OpenTSLM-SoftPrompt通过软提示将可学习时间序列标记与文本标记连接进行隐式建模；OpenTSLM-Flamingo通过交叉注意力机制将时间序列与文本集成进行显式建模。

Result: 在三个数据集（HAR-CoT、Sleep-CoT、ECG-QA-CoT）上，OpenTSLM模型均优于基线，睡眠分期达到69.9 F1，HAR达到65.4 F1，显著优于仅文本模型（9.05和52.2）。即使是1B参数的OpenTSLM也超越了GPT-4o。

Conclusion: OpenTSLM成功将时间序列作为原生模态集成到LLMs中，在医疗时间序列推理任务中表现出色，Flamingo架构在长序列处理上更具优势且内存需求稳定。

Abstract: LLMs have emerged as powerful tools for interpreting multimodal data. In
medicine, they hold particular promise for synthesizing large volumes of
clinical information into actionable insights and digital health applications.
Yet, a major limitation remains their inability to handle time series. To
overcome this gap, we present OpenTSLM, a family of Time Series Language Models
(TSLMs) created by integrating time series as a native modality to pretrained
LLMs, enabling reasoning over multiple time series of any length. We
investigate two architectures for OpenTSLM. The first, OpenTSLM-SoftPrompt,
models time series implicitly by concatenating learnable time series tokens
with text tokens via soft prompting. Although parameter-efficient, we
hypothesize that explicit time series modeling scales better and outperforms
implicit approaches. We thus introduce OpenTSLM-Flamingo, which integrates time
series with text via cross-attention. We benchmark both variants against
baselines that treat time series as text tokens or plots, across a suite of
text-time-series Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning tasks. We introduce three
datasets: HAR-CoT, Sleep-CoT, and ECG-QA-CoT. Across all, OpenTSLM models
outperform baselines, reaching 69.9 F1 in sleep staging and 65.4 in HAR,
compared to 9.05 and 52.2 for finetuned text-only models. Notably, even
1B-parameter OpenTSLM models surpass GPT-4o (15.47 and 2.95). OpenTSLM-Flamingo
matches OpenTSLM-SoftPrompt in performance and outperforms on longer sequences,
while maintaining stable memory requirements. By contrast, SoftPrompt grows
exponentially in memory with sequence length, requiring around 110 GB compared
to 40 GB VRAM when training on ECG-QA with LLaMA-3B. Expert reviews by
clinicians find strong reasoning capabilities exhibited by OpenTSLMs on ECG-QA.
To facilitate further research, we provide all code, datasets, and models
open-source.

*Lin Chen,Jun Chen,Minghui Qiu,Shuxin Zhong,Binghong Chen,Kaishun Wu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RainSeer是一个结构感知的降雨场重建框架，利用雷达反射率作为物理结构先验，通过两阶段物理信息架构解决雷达数据与地面降雨观测之间的空间对齐和物理转换问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有空间插值方法往往过度平滑关键结构，无法捕捉急剧变化和局地极端值，需要更准确地重建高分辨率降雨场以支持洪水预报、水文建模和气候分析。

Method: 采用物理信息的两阶段架构：结构-点映射器通过双向映射将中尺度雷达结构投影到局地地面降雨，实现空间对齐；地理感知降雨解码器通过因果时空注意力机制捕捉水凝物下降过程中的语义转换。

Result: 在两个公共数据集（RAIN-F和MeteoNet）上评估，相比最先进基线方法，MAE降低超过13.31%，重建降雨场的结构保真度显著提升。

Conclusion: RainSeer通过将雷达反射率重新解释为物理结构先验，有效解决了降雨场重建中的结构保持问题，在准确性和结构保真度方面均优于现有方法。

Abstract: Reconstructing high-resolution rainfall fields is essential for flood
forecasting, hydrological modeling, and climate analysis. However, existing
spatial interpolation methods-whether based on automatic weather station (AWS)
measurements or enhanced with satellite/radar observations often over-smooth
critical structures, failing to capture sharp transitions and localized
extremes. We introduce RainSeer, a structure-aware reconstruction framework
that reinterprets radar reflectivity as a physically grounded structural
prior-capturing when, where, and how rain develops. This shift, however,
introduces two fundamental challenges: (i) translating high-resolution
volumetric radar fields into sparse point-wise rainfall observations, and (ii)
bridging the physical disconnect between aloft hydro-meteors and ground-level
precipitation. RainSeer addresses these through a physics-informed two-stage
architecture: a Structure-to-Point Mapper performs spatial alignment by
projecting mesoscale radar structures into localized ground-level rainfall,
through a bidirectional mapping, and a Geo-Aware Rain Decoder captures the
semantic transformation of hydro-meteors through descent, melting, and
evaporation via a causal spatiotemporal attention mechanism. We evaluate
RainSeer on two public datasets-RAIN-F (Korea, 2017-2019) and MeteoNet (France,
2016-2018)-and observe consistent improvements over state-of-the-art baselines,
reducing MAE by over 13.31% and significantly enhancing structural fidelity in
reconstructed rainfall fields.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种残差学习框架，通过在多个交叉阵列瓦片上顺序学习来补偿低精度权重更新的残差误差，解决了模拟内存计算中由于设备状态有限导致的训练精度下降问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 模拟内存计算加速器使用电阻交叉阵列直接在内存中进行深度神经网络计算，但实际训练需要至少8位电导状态才能匹配数字基准。许多有前景的忆阻器件如ReRAM由于制造限制只能提供约4位分辨率，这种有限的更新精度显著降低了训练精度。

Method: 提出残差学习框架，在多个交叉阵列瓦片上顺序学习以补偿低精度权重更新的残差误差。理论分析显示最优性差距随瓦片数量缩小，并实现线性收敛速率。

Result: 在标准图像分类基准测试中，该方法在有限状态设置下始终优于最先进的模拟内存训练策略，成本分析确认仅产生适度的硬件开销。

Conclusion: 该残差学习框架能够在使用有限状态忆阻器件的芯片上实现有效训练，同时保持合理的硬件成本。

Abstract: Analog in-memory computing (AIMC) accelerators enable efficient deep neural
network computation directly within memory using resistive crossbar arrays,
where model parameters are represented by the conductance states of memristive
devices. However, effective in-memory training typically requires at least
8-bit conductance states to match digital baselines. Realizing such
fine-grained states is costly and often requires complex noise mitigation
techniques that increase circuit complexity and energy consumption. In
practice, many promising memristive devices such as ReRAM offer only about
4-bit resolution due to fabrication constraints, and this limited update
precision substantially degrades training accuracy. To enable on-chip training
with these limited-state devices, this paper proposes a \emph{residual
learning} framework that sequentially learns on multiple crossbar tiles to
compensate the residual errors from low-precision weight updates. Our
theoretical analysis shows that the optimality gap shrinks with the number of
tiles and achieves a linear convergence rate. Experiments on standard image
classification benchmarks demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art in-memory analog training strategies under limited-state
settings, while incurring only moderate hardware overhead as confirmed by our
cost analysis.

### [12] [How to Train Your Advisor: Steering Black-Box LLMs with Advisor Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02453)
*Parth Asawa,Alan Zhu,Matei Zaharia,Alexandros G. Dimakis,Joseph E. Gonzalez*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Advisor Models是轻量级参数化策略，通过强化学习训练，能够对黑盒模型进行动态的上下文自然语言指导，相比静态提示优化具有更好的适应性和性能表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基础模型作为黑盒服务部署时，模型权重无法修改，定制仅限于提示。静态提示优化产生单一固定提示，无法适应不同输入、用户或环境。

Method: 使用强化学习训练轻量级参数化策略（Advisor Models），在输入和模型之间插入第二个小模型，基于环境奖励信号对每个实例进行行为塑造。

Result: 在推理和个性化等多个领域，Advisor Models优于静态提示优化器，能够发现环境动态并提高下游任务性能，同时具有跨黑盒模型的可迁移性。

Conclusion: Advisor Models为黑盒系统提供了可学习的接口，是实现个性化和环境适应性AI的有前景方向，同时保持对分布外输入的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Foundation models are increasingly deployed as black-box services, where
model weights cannot be modified and customization is limited to prompting.
While static prompt optimization has shown promise, it produces a single fixed
prompt that fails to adapt to different inputs, users, or environments. We
introduce Advisor Models, lightweight parametric policies trained with
reinforcement learning to reactively issue natural language steering
instructions in-context to black-box models. The advisor is a second small
model that sits between the input and the model, shaping behavior on a
per-instance basis using reward signals from the environment. Across multiple
domains involving reasoning and personalization, we show that Advisor Models
outperform static prompt optimizers, discovering environment dynamics and
improving downstream task performance. We also demonstrate the generalizability
of advisors by transferring them across black-box models, as well as the
framework's ability to achieve specialization while retaining robustness to
out-of-distribution inputs. Viewed more broadly, Advisor Models provide a
learnable interface to black-box systems where the advisor acts as a
parametric, environment-specific memory. We argue that dynamic optimization of
black-box models via Advisor Models is a promising direction for enabling
personalization and environment-adaptable AI with frontier-level capabilities.

Method: 使用成本函数预测市场（LMSR）为每个样本定价，信号作为交易者，通过价格-每token规则处理token预算，加入轻量级多样性头提高覆盖度。

Result: 在GSM8K（60k token预算）上达到与强基线相当的性能，同时降低种子方差，选择开销<0.1 GPU小时；在AGNews（保留5-25%数据）上获得竞争性准确率，并改善平衡性和稳定性。

Conclusion: 该框架在固定计算预算下统一了多信号数据筛选，适用于提示级推理和分类任务，提供了透明可控的聚合机制。

Abstract: Selecting a small yet useful subset of training data is hard because signals
of example utility (uncertainty, rarity, diversity, etc.) are heterogeneous and
typically combined with ad hoc weights. We propose a market-based selector that
prices each example via a cost-function prediction market (LMSR), signals act
as traders, a single liquidity parameter controls concentration, and topic-wise
normalization stabilizes calibration. Token budgets are handled explicitly by a
price-per-token rule $\rho=p/\ell^{\gamma}$, with $\gamma$ exposing an
interpretable length bias; a lightweight diversity head improves coverage. We
quantify coverage via topic cluster coverage and effective sample size. On the
theory side, we show that LMSR implements a maximum-entropy aggregation with
exponential weighting and a convex objective, yielding transparent knobs for
aggregation strength. Empirically, on GSM8K (60k-token budget) the market with
diversity achieves parity with strong single-signal baselines while reducing
seed variance and incurring $<\!0.1$ GPU-hr selection overhead; on AGNews at
kept=5-25\% the market (with light balancing) delivers competitive accuracy
with improved balance and stability. The framework unifies multi-signal data
curation under fixed compute for prompt-level reasoning and classification.

TL;DR: 该论文研究了后训练量化(PTQ)在安全关键环境中可能导致的极端性能下降问题，通过知识蒸馏和强化学习发现了可能导致10-65%精度下降的"有害"网络-策略对。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索后训练量化在安全关键部署环境中可能导致的极端性能下降，研究输入分布特征如何引发这种下降，强调实际部署中需要谨慎考虑安全性。

Method: 使用知识蒸馏和强化学习来学习网络和比特宽度策略对，分析量化下最坏情况的灾难性故障潜力，通过系统实验识别最高脆弱点。

Result: 确认存在"有害"网络-策略对，多个实例显示精度下降10-65%，而"鲁棒"对应物仅下降<2%。系统实验提供了最高脆弱点的初步探索。

Conclusion: 研究结果强调在实际部署中需要谨慎，鼓励对鲁棒性进行更严格检查，并在深度学习领域更重视安全考虑。

Abstract: Post-training quantization (PTQ) has recently emerged as an effective tool
for reducing the computational complexity and memory usage of a neural network
by representing its weights and activations with lower precision. While this
paradigm has shown great success in lowering compute and storage costs, there
is the potential for drastic performance reduction depending upon the
distribution of inputs experienced in inference. When considering possible
deployment in safety-critical environments, it is important to investigate the
extent of potential performance reduction, and what characteristics of input
distributions may give rise to this reduction. In this work, we explore the
idea of extreme failure stemming from dynamic PTQ and formulate a knowledge
distillation and reinforcement learning task to learn a network and bit-width
policy pair such that catastrophic failure under quantization is analyzed in
terms of worst case potential. Our results confirm the existence of this
"detrimental" network-policy pair, with several instances demonstrating
performance reductions in the range of 10-65% in accuracy, compared to their
"robust" counterparts encountering a <2% decrease. From systematic
experimentation and analyses, we also provide an initial exploration into
points at highest vulnerability. While our results represent an initial step
toward understanding failure cases introduced by PTQ, our findings ultimately
emphasize the need for caution in real-world deployment scenarios. We hope this
work encourages more rigorous examinations of robustness and a greater emphasis
on safety considerations for future works within the broader field of deep
learning.

TL;DR: SAGE是一种流式数据子集选择方法，通过维护梯度几何的紧凑Frequent Directions草图，优先选择与共识方向对齐的样本，实现高效训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在大型数据集上训练现代神经网络计算和能耗密集，需要更高效的训练方法。

Method: 使用Frequent Directions草图在O(ℓD)内存中维护梯度几何，通过两遍GPU友好流水线选择与共识梯度方向对齐的样本。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，SAGE使用小子集预算训练，保持与全数据训练相当的准确率，同时减少端到端计算和峰值内存。

Conclusion: SAGE提供了一种实用的恒定内存替代方案，可与剪枝和模型压缩互补，实现高效训练。

Abstract: Training modern neural networks on large datasets is computationally and
energy intensive. We present SAGE, a streaming data-subset selection method
that maintains a compact Frequent Directions (FD) sketch of gradient geometry
in $O(\ell D)$ memory and prioritizes examples whose sketched gradients align
with a consensus direction. The approach eliminates $N \times N$ pairwise
similarities and explicit $N \times \ell$ gradient stores, yielding a simple
two-pass, GPU-friendly pipeline. Leveraging FD's deterministic approximation
guarantees, we analyze how agreement scoring preserves gradient energy within
the principal sketched subspace. Across multiple benchmarks, SAGE trains with
small kept-rate budgets while retaining competitive accuracy relative to
full-data training and recent subset-selection baselines, and reduces
end-to-end compute and peak memory. Overall, SAGE offers a practical,
constant-memory alternative that complements pruning and model compression for
efficient training.

*Jie Li,Andrew McCarthy,Zhizhuo Zhang,Stephen Young*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本研究提出了一种基于不确定性的模型选择策略，用于优化生物分子功效预测中的集成学习。通过使用TabPFN模型和序列特征，在siRNA敲低功效任务中超越了现有最佳预测器，并证明模型的不确定性（IQR）与真实预测误差负相关。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 上下文学习器如TabPFN在生物分子功效预测中很有前景，但其性能对提供的上下文高度敏感。在没有真实标签的情况下如何选择最佳模型进行集成是一个开放性问题。

Method: 使用TabPFN模型和简单序列特征，通过模型预测的区间范围（IQR）作为不确定性度量，选择具有最低平均IQR的模型进行集成平均。

Result: 在siRNA敲低功效任务中，TabPFN模型超越了专门的现有最佳预测器。模型的不确定性（IQR）与真实预测误差呈负相关。通过选择具有最低平均IQR的模型进行集成，性能优于朴素集成或使用单一模型。

Conclusion: 模型不确定性是优化生物分子功效预测的强大、无需标签的启发式方法。

Abstract: In-context learners like TabPFN are promising for biomolecule efficacy
prediction, where established molecular feature sets and relevant experimental
results can serve as powerful contextual examples. However, their performance
is highly sensitive to the provided context, making strategies like post-hoc
ensembling of models trained on different data subsets a viable approach. An
open question is how to select the best models for the ensemble without access
to ground truth labels. In this study, we investigate an uncertainty-guided
strategy for model selection. We demonstrate on an siRNA knockdown efficacy
task that a TabPFN model using simple sequence-based features can surpass
specialized state-of-the-art predictors. We also show that the model's
predicted inter-quantile range (IQR), a measure of its uncertainty, has a
negative correlation with true prediction error. By selecting and averaging an
ensemble of models with the lowest mean IQR, we achieve superior performance
compared to naive ensembling or using a single model trained on all available
data. This finding highlights model uncertainty as a powerful, label-free
heuristic for optimizing biomolecule efficacy predictions.

Abstract: Training Large Language Models (LLMs) is plagued by long training times and
massive energy consumption, with modern models requiring months of computation
and gigawatt-hours of electricity. In light of these challenges,we introduce
Litespark, a novel pre-training framework that addresses these inefficiencies
through targeted optimizations to transformer attention and MLP layers. Our
approach combines architectural improvements with algorithmic enhancements to
maximize Model FLOPs Utilization (MFU) while maintaining compatibility with
standard transformer implementations. Comprehensive benchmarking on 3B and 30B
parameter Llama models using the SlimPajama-627B dataset demonstrates
substantial performance gains: 2x-6x training throughput improvement and
$55\%-83$% energy consumption reduction across multi-node H200 GPU clusters.
These optimizations are model- and hardware-agnostic, enabling broad
applicability across transformer architectures and extending to post-training
phases including supervised fine-tuning and direct preference optimization.

*Rafael Rodriguez-Sanchez,Cameron Allen,George Konidaris*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出Action-Controllable Factorization (ACF)方法，通过对比学习从高维观察中发现可独立控制的潜在变量，解决了传统方法需要先验知识而深度强化学习无法利用分解结构的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有分解MDP方法需要已知分解表示，而深度强化学习无法利用分解结构，这限制了在仅能获得高维观察时的样本效率。

Method: 使用对比学习方法发现可独立控制的潜在变量，利用动作通常只影响变量子集而其他变量在环境动态下演化的稀疏性特性。

Result: 在三个已知分解结构的基准测试（Taxi、FourRooms、MiniGrid-DoorKey）中，ACF直接从像素观察恢复了真实可控因子，始终优于基线解耦算法。

Conclusion: ACF成功解决了高维观察下的表示问题，能够发现可独立控制的潜在变量，为利用分解结构提供了有效途径。

Abstract: Algorithms that exploit factored Markov decision processes are far more
sample-efficient than factor-agnostic methods, yet they assume a factored
representation is known a priori -- a requirement that breaks down when the
agent sees only high-dimensional observations. Conversely, deep reinforcement
learning handles such inputs but cannot benefit from factored structure. We
address this representation problem with Action-Controllable Factorization
(ACF), a contrastive learning approach that uncovers independently controllable
latent variables -- state components each action can influence separately. ACF
leverages sparsity: actions typically affect only a subset of variables, while
the rest evolve under the environment's dynamics, yielding informative data for
contrastive training. ACF recovers the ground truth controllable factors
directly from pixel observations on three benchmarks with known factored
structure -- Taxi, FourRooms, and MiniGrid-DoorKey -- consistently
outperforming baseline disentanglement algorithms.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合深度强化学习(DRL)和有界极值搜索(ES)的混合控制器，用于提高非线性时变系统的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DRL在处理多参数系统时具有快速学习能力，但在系统模型快速变化时性能会严重下降；而ES虽然能处理时变系统，但收敛速度慢且容易陷入局部最小值。

Method: 将DRL和ES结合形成混合控制器，DRL利用历史数据快速控制多参数系统，ES确保对时变性的鲁棒性。

Result: 混合控制器的性能超过了单独使用DRL或ES的效果，在数值研究和粒子加速器自动调谐应用中表现出色。

Conclusion: DRL和ES的结合能够互补各自的缺点，为时变多参数系统提供既快速又鲁棒的控制方案。

Abstract: In this paper, we study the use of robust model independent bounded extremum
seeking (ES) feedback control to improve the robustness of deep reinforcement
learning (DRL) controllers for a class of nonlinear time-varying systems. DRL
has the potential to learn from large datasets to quickly control or optimize
the outputs of many-parameter systems, but its performance degrades
catastrophically when the system model changes rapidly over time. Bounded ES
can handle time-varying systems with unknown control directions, but its
convergence speed slows down as the number of tuned parameters increases and,
like all local adaptive methods, it can get stuck in local minima. We
demonstrate that together, DRL and bounded ES result in a hybrid controller
whose performance exceeds the sum of its parts with DRL taking advantage of
historical data to learn how to quickly control a many-parameter system to a
desired setpoint while bounded ES ensures its robustness to time variations. We
present a numerical study of a general time-varying system and a combined
ES-DRL controller for automatic tuning of the Low Energy Beam Transport section
at the Los Alamos Neutron Science Center linear particle accelerator.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文揭示了监督微调(SFT)与逆强化学习的等价关系，证明SFT不仅能学习策略，还能学习隐式的密集token级奖励模型，并提出了从SFT模型中提取密集奖励信号的方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统上将SFT视为简单的模仿学习过程，本文挑战这一观点，旨在证明SFT实际上是一种强大的奖励学习机制。

Method: 建立了SFT与逆Q学习的等价关系，提出了从SFT模型中提取密集奖励信号的基线相对奖励函数，并开发了Dense-Path REINFORCE方法。

Result: Dense-Path REINFORCE方法在指令跟随基准测试中持续优于原始SFT模型。

Conclusion: 本文重新定义了SFT不仅是策略模仿，更是一种强大的奖励学习机制，为利用专家演示开辟了新可能性。

Abstract: Conventionally, supervised fine-tuning (SFT) is treated as a simple imitation
learning process that only trains a policy to imitate expert behavior on
demonstration datasets. In this work, we challenge this view by establishing a
fundamental equivalence between SFT and Inverse Reinforcement Learning. We
prove that the SFT objective is a special case of Inverse Q-Learning, which
implies that the SFT process does not just learn a policy, but also an
implicit, dense, token-level reward model that explains the expert
demonstrations. We then show how to recover this dense reward signal directly
from the SFT model by formulating a baseline-relative reward function. The
availability of such a dense reward model offers numerous benefits, providing
granular credit assignment for each token generated. We demonstrate one key
application by using these recovered rewards to further improve the policy with
reinforcement learning. Our method, Dense-Path REINFORCE, consistently
outperforms the original SFT models on instruction-following benchmarks. This
work reframes SFT not merely as policy imitation but as a powerful reward
learning mechanism, opening new possibilities for leveraging expert
demonstrations.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了Spectral Geodesic Flow Matching (SFMG)框架，通过谱特征映射将图嵌入到黎曼流形中，利用测地流进行图生成，在保持性能的同时显著提升训练效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图生成方法通常只对齐图的谱或度分布，但忽略了特征向量诱导的几何结构和图的全局结构。

Method: 使用谱特征映射将输入图和目标图嵌入到连续黎曼流形中，定义嵌入之间的测地流，并沿着这些流匹配分布来生成输出图。

Result: 在多种基准测试中，SFMG在图元、度和谱指标上与最先进方法性能相当，同时比基于扩散的模型快30倍，并能泛化到未见过的图规模。

Conclusion: SFMG通过将谱几何与流匹配相结合，为图合成提供了一种新方法，在保持性能的同时显著提升了可扩展性和训练效率。

Abstract: Graph generation is a fundamental task with wide applications in modeling
complex systems. Although existing methods align the spectrum or degree profile
of the target graph, they often ignore the geometry induced by eigenvectors and
the global structure of the graph. In this work, we propose Spectral Geodesic
Flow Matching (SFMG), a novel framework that uses spectral eigenmaps to embed
both input and target graphs into continuous Riemannian manifolds. We then
define geodesic flows between embeddings and match distributions along these
flows to generate output graphs. Our method yields several advantages: (i)
captures geometric structure beyond eigenvalues, (ii) supports flexible
generation of diverse graphs, and (iii) scales efficiently. Empirically, SFMG
matches the performance of state-of-the-art approaches on graphlet, degree, and
spectral metrics across diverse benchmarks. In particular, it achieves up to
30$\times$ speedup over diffusion-based models, offering a substantial
advantage in scalability and training efficiency. We also demonstrate its
ability to generalize to unseen graph scales. Overall, SFMG provides a new
approach to graph synthesis by integrating spectral geometry with flow
matching.

Main category: cs.LG

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前缺乏比较模型激活与大脑响应的标准方法，需要更严格的比较框架来评估神经网络作为大脑机制模型的准确性。

Method: 使用IATC方法，识别在动物群体中准确映射神经响应所需的最严格函数集，双向映射模型响应与大脑数据，评估模型伪装成典型被试的能力。

Result: IATC能够解析神经机制的细节特征（如非线性激活函数），实现神经活动准确预测和高特异性机制识别，在不同脑区响应模式分离和同脑区响应对齐方面表现优异。

Conclusion: IATC证明了模型预测性与机制识别准确性之间不存在固有权衡，为地形深度神经网络作为视觉系统模型提供了新证据，改进了模型-大脑比较方法。

Abstract: Artificial neural network models have emerged as promising mechanistic models
of the brain. However, there is little consensus on the correct method for
comparing model activations to brain responses. Drawing on recent work in
philosophy of neuroscience, we propose a comparison methodology based on the
Inter-Animal Transform Class (IATC) - the strictest set of functions needed to
accurately map neural responses between subjects in an animal population. Using
the IATC, we can map bidirectionally between a candidate model's responses and
brain data, assessing how well the model can masquerade as a typical subject
using the same kinds of transforms needed to map across real subjects. We
identify the IATC in three settings: a simulated population of neural network
models, a population of mouse subjects, and a population of human subjects. We
find that the IATC resolves detailed aspects of the neural mechanism, such as
the non-linear activation function. Most importantly, we find that the IATC
enables accurate predictions of neural activity while also achieving high
specificity in mechanism identification, evidenced by its ability to separate
response patterns from different brain areas while strongly aligning
same-brain-area responses between subjects. In other words, the IATC is a
proof-by-existence that there is no inherent tradeoff between the neural
engineering goal of high model-brain predictivity and the neuroscientific goal
of identifying mechanistically accurate brain models. Using IATC-guided
transforms, we obtain new evidence in favor of topographical deep neural
networks (TDANNs) as models of the visual system. Overall, the IATC enables
principled model-brain comparisons, contextualizing previous findings about the
predictive success of deep learning models of the brain, while improving upon
previous approaches to model-brain comparison.

Motivation: 开发能够同时进行时序聚类和结果预测的模型，从纵向可穿戴数据中识别行为亚型并预测抑郁风险。

Method: 使用注意力GRU自编码器联合优化三个目标：序列重构学习潜在表示、通过二元分类预测抑郁率、基于GMM的软聚类识别行为亚型。

Result: 在372名参与者数据上，聚类质量（轮廓分数0.70）和抑郁分类（AUC 0.74）均优于基线；在332名参与者外部验证中保持稳定性。

Conclusion: AttentiveGRUAE能有效识别临床可解释的行为亚型，通过可视化时间注意力机制揭示睡眠规律变化与抑郁风险的关系。

Abstract: In this study, we present AttentiveGRUAE, a novel attention-based gated
recurrent unit (GRU) autoencoder designed for temporal clustering and
prediction of outcome from longitudinal wearable data. Our model jointly
optimizes three objectives: (1) learning a compact latent representation of
daily behavioral features via sequence reconstruction, (2) predicting
end-of-period depression rate through a binary classification head, and (3)
identifying behavioral subtypes through Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) based soft
clustering of learned embeddings. We evaluate AttentiveGRUAE on longitudinal
sleep data from 372 participants (GLOBEM 2018-2019), and it demonstrates
superior performance over baseline clustering, domain-aligned self-supervised,
and ablated models in both clustering quality (silhouette score = 0.70 vs
0.32-0.70) and depression classification (AUC = 0.74 vs 0.50-0.67).
Additionally, external validation on cross-year cohorts from 332 participants
(GLOBEM 2020-2021) confirms cluster reproducibility (silhouette score = 0.63,
AUC = 0.61) and stability. We further perform subtype analysis and visualize
temporal attention, which highlights sleep-related differences between clusters
and identifies salient time windows that align with changes in sleep
regularity, yielding clinically interpretable explanations of risk.

Conclusion: 高阶节点导数提供了一种增强GNN表达能力的自然方式，HOD-GNN方法在理论和实验上都显示出优越性。

Abstract: Despite significant advances in Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), their limited
expressivity remains a fundamental challenge. Research on GNN expressivity has
produced many expressive architectures, leading to architecture hierarchies
with models of increasing expressive power. Separately, derivatives of GNNs
with respect to node features have been widely studied in the context of the
oversquashing and over-smoothing phenomena, GNN explainability, and more. To
date, these derivatives remain unexplored as a means to enhance GNN
expressivity. In this paper, we show that these derivatives provide a natural
way to enhance the expressivity of GNNs. We introduce High-Order Derivative GNN
(HOD-GNN), a novel method that enhances the expressivity of Message Passing
Neural Networks (MPNNs) by leveraging high-order node derivatives of the base
model. These derivatives generate expressive structure-aware node embeddings
processed by a second GNN in an end-to-end trainable architecture.
Theoretically, we show that the resulting architecture family's expressive
power aligns with the WL hierarchy. We also draw deep connections between
HOD-GNN, Subgraph GNNs, and popular structural encoding schemes. For
computational efficiency, we develop a message-passing algorithm for computing
high-order derivatives of MPNNs that exploits graph sparsity and parallelism.
Evaluations on popular graph learning benchmarks demonstrate HOD-GNN's strong
performance on popular graph learning tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目标网络方法虽然稳定但学习缓慢，而直接使用在线网络作为目标会导致学习不稳定。MINTO旨在结合两者的优点。

Method: 通过计算目标网络和在线网络的最小值来生成目标值，这种简单修改可以无缝集成到各种基于值和actor-critic算法中。

Result: 在在线和离线RL、离散和连续动作空间等多种基准测试中，MINTO始终提高性能，证明了其广泛适用性。

Conclusion: MINTO通过简单的修改实现了更快更稳定的值函数学习，有效缓解了在线网络引导时的过估计偏差。

Abstract: The use of target networks is a popular approach for estimating value
functions in deep Reinforcement Learning (RL). While effective, the target
network remains a compromise solution that preserves stability at the cost of
slowly moving targets, thus delaying learning. Conversely, using the online
network as a bootstrapped target is intuitively appealing, albeit well-known to
lead to unstable learning. In this work, we aim to obtain the best out of both
worlds by introducing a novel update rule that computes the target using the
MINimum estimate between the Target and Online network, giving rise to our
method, MINTO. Through this simple, yet effective modification, we show that
MINTO enables faster and stable value function learning, by mitigating the
potential overestimation bias of using the online network for bootstrapping.
Notably, MINTO can be seamlessly integrated into a wide range of value-based
and actor-critic algorithms with a negligible cost. We evaluate MINTO
extensively across diverse benchmarks, spanning online and offline RL, as well
as discrete and continuous action spaces. Across all benchmarks, MINTO
consistently improves performance, demonstrating its broad applicability and
effectiveness.

Here, we report on a CONUS-wide large-sample study (spanning diverse
hydro-geo-climatic conditions) using ML-augmented physically-interpretable
catchment-scale models of varying complexity based in the Mass-Conserving
Perceptron (MCP). Results were evaluated using attribute masks such as snow
regime, forest cover, and climate zone. Our results indicate the importance of
selecting model architectures of appropriate model complexity based on how
process dominance varies with hydrological regime. Benchmark comparisons show
that physically-interpretable mass-conserving MCP-based models can achieve
performance comparable to data-based models based in the Long Short-Term Memory
network (LSTM) architecture. Overall, this study highlights the potential of a
theory-informed, physically grounded approach to large-sample hydrology, with
emphasis on mechanistic understanding and the development of parsimonious and
interpretable model architectures, thereby laying the foundation for future
models of everywhere that architecturally encode information about spatially-
and temporally-varying process dominance.

TL;DR: MINERVA是一种基于神经网络互信息估计的监督特征选择方法，通过两阶段处理解耦表示学习和特征选择，能有效捕捉高阶特征交互依赖关系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有特征过滤器依赖统计成对依赖度量来建模特征-目标关系，但当目标依赖于高阶特征交互而非个体贡献时，这种方法可能失效。

Method: 使用神经网络参数化互信息近似，通过精心设计的损失函数和稀疏正则化进行特征选择，采用两阶段过程解耦表示学习和特征选择。

Conclusion: MINERVA方法能够有效处理传统方法难以捕捉的高阶特征交互依赖，在特征选择任务中表现出色。

Abstract: Existing feature filters rely on statistical pair-wise dependence metrics to
model feature-target relationships, but this approach may fail when the target
depends on higher-order feature interactions rather than individual
contributions. We introduce Mutual Information Neural Estimation Regularized
Vetting Algorithm (MINERVA), a novel approach to supervised feature selection
based on neural estimation of mutual information between features and targets.
We paramaterize the approximation of mutual information with neural networks
and perform feature selection using a carefully designed loss function
augmented with sparsity-inducing regularizers. Our method is implemented in a
two-stage process to decouple representation learning from feature selection,
ensuring better generalization and a more accurate expression of feature
importance. We present examples of ubiquitous dependency structures that are
rarely captured in literature and show that our proposed method effectively
captures these complex feature-target relationships by evaluating feature
subsets as an ensemble. Experimental results on synthetic and real-life fraud
datasets demonstrate the efficacy of our method and its ability to perform
exact solutions.

Abstract: Missing data is a pervasive problem in tabular settings. Existing solutions
range from simple averaging to complex generative adversarial networks.
However, due to huge variance in performance across real-world domains and
time-consuming hyperparameter tuning, no default imputation method exists.
Building on TabPFN, a recent tabular foundation model for supervised learning,
we propose TabImpute, a pre-trained transformer that delivers accurate and fast
zero-shot imputations requiring no fitting or hyperparameter tuning at
inference-time. To train and evaluate TabImpute, we introduce (i) an entry-wise
featurization for tabular settings, which enables a $100\times$ speedup over
the previous TabPFN imputation method, (ii) a synthetic training data
generation pipeline incorporating realistic missingness patterns, which boosts
test-time performance, and (iii) MissBench, a comprehensive benchmark for
evaluation of imputation methods with $42$ OpenML datasets and $13$ missingness
patterns. MissBench spans domains such as medicine, finance, and engineering,
showcasing TabImpute's robust performance compared to $11$ established

TL;DR: 提出了HyperAdaLoRA框架，通过基于注意力的超网络动态生成SVD参数，加速AdaLoRA的收敛速度，同时保持性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AdaLoRA虽然通过SVD和奇异值剪枝实现了动态秩分配，但在训练过程中存在收敛速度慢和计算开销高的问题。

Method: 使用基于注意力的超网络动态生成SVD参数（P, Λ, Q），通过剪枝超网络生成的奇异值输出实现动态秩分配，避免直接优化SVD组件。

Result: 在多个数据集和模型上的实验表明，该方法实现了更快的收敛速度且不牺牲性能，在其他基于LoRA的方法上的扩展实验验证了其广泛适用性。

Conclusion: HyperAdaLoRA通过超网络机制有效解决了AdaLoRA的收敛问题，为大语言模型的高效微调提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT), especially Low-Rank Adaptation
(LoRA), has emerged as a promising approach to fine-tuning large language
models(LLMs) while reducing computational and memory overhead. However, LoRA
assumes a uniform rank \textit{r} for each incremental matrix, not accounting
for the varying significance of weight matrices across different modules and
layers. AdaLoRA leverages Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to parameterize
updates and employs pruning of singular values to introduce dynamic rank
allocation, thereby enhancing adaptability. However, during the training
process, it often encounters issues of slow convergence speed and high
computational overhead. To address this issue, we propose HyperAdaLoRA, a novel
framework that accelerates the convergence of AdaLoRA by leveraging a
hypernetwork. Instead of directly optimizing the components of Singular Value
Decomposition $(P, \Lambda, Q)$, HyperAdaLoRA employs a hypernetwork based on
attention mechanisms to dynamically generate these parameters. By pruning the
outputs of the hypernetwork that generates the singular values, dynamic rank
allocation is achieved. Comprehensive experiments on various datasets and
models demonstrate that our method achieves faster convergence without
sacrificing performance. Additionally, further extension experiments on other
LoRA-based approaches validate the broad applicability of our method.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于对抗自编码器的无监督深度学习框架，用于优化桥梁健康监测中的巡检车辆参数，提高损伤检测灵敏度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的车载巡检方法中，车辆的机械和动态特性显著影响损伤检测性能，限制了该方法的有效性。

Method: 使用对抗自编码器重构加速度响应的频域表示，通过最小化健康与损伤状态下损伤指标分布的Wasserstein距离来优化车辆轮胎悬挂系统的质量和刚度参数，并采用Kriging元模型高效逼近目标函数。

Result: 研究发现，相对于桥梁第一固有频率的频率比在0.3-0.7之间的车辆效果最佳，而接近共振的车辆性能较差；较轻的车辆需要较低的固有频率以获得最佳检测效果。

Conclusion: 这是首个严格优化车载感知平台并建议定制巡检车辆的研究，为桥梁健康监测提供了优化的车辆配置方案。

Abstract: Drive-by inspection for bridge health monitoring has gained increasing
attention over the past decade. This method involves analysing the coupled
vehicle-bridge response, recorded by an instrumented inspection vehicle, to
assess structural integrity and detect damage. However, the vehicles mechanical
and dynamic properties significantly influence detection performance, limiting
the effectiveness of the approach. This study presents a framework for
optimising the inspection vehicle to enhance damage sensitivity. An
unsupervised deep learning methodbased on adversarial autoencoders (AAE)is used
to reconstruct the frequency-domain representation of acceleration responses.
The mass and stiffness of the tyre suspension system of a two-axle vehicle are
optimised by minimising the Wasserstein distance between damage index
distributions for healthy and damaged bridge states. A Kriging meta-model is
employed to approximate this objective function efficiently and identify
optimal vehicle configurations in both dimensional and non-dimensional
parameter spaces. Results show that vehicles with frequency ratios between 0.3
and 0.7 relative to the bridges' first natural frequency are most effective,
while those near resonance perform poorly. Lighter vehicles require lower
natural frequencies for optimal detection. This is the first study to
rigorously optimise the sensing platform for drive-by sensing and to propose a
purpose-built inspection vehicle.

TL;DR: TutorBench是一个用于评估LLMs辅导能力的基准数据集，包含1,490个由专家策划的高中和AP课程样本，涵盖自适应解释、反馈提供和提示生成三个核心辅导任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着学生越来越多地使用LLMs作为学习辅助工具，需要开发能够理解学生需求、具有适应性、提供个性化指导且准确的模型。

Method: 构建包含三个常见辅导任务的数据集：生成自适应解释、提供可操作反馈、促进主动学习的提示生成。使用样本特定评分标准和LLM-judge进行自动评估。

Result: 评估了16个前沿LLMs，结果显示所有模型得分均不超过56%，在指导、诊断和支持学生方面的评分标准通过率低于60%。不同模型家族表现出不同优势：Claude模型在支持主动学习方面表现最佳，但在其他两个用例中落后。

Conclusion: 当前前沿LLMs在展示完整辅导技能方面仍有不足，TutorBench为开发下一代AI导师提供了全面且未饱和的基准。

Abstract: As students increasingly adopt large language models (LLMs) as learning aids,
it is crucial to build models that are adept at handling the nuances of
tutoring: they need to identify the core needs of students, be adaptive,
provide personalized guidance, and be accurate. To this end, we introduce
TutorBench, a dataset and evaluation benchmark designed to rigorously evaluate
the core tutoring skills of LLMs. The dataset comprises 1,490 samples curated
by human experts, focused on high-school and AP-level curricula. The samples
are drawn from three common tutoring tasks: (i) generating adaptive
explanations tailored to a student's confusion, (ii) providing actionable
feedback on a student's work, and (iii) promoting active learning through
effective hint generation. To account for the inherent complexity of tutoring,
samples are accompanied by sample-specific rubrics which are used to judge
model responses during evaluation. TutorBench uses a reliable and fine-grained
automatic evaluation method that uses an LLM-judge and the sample-specific
rubrics. We evaluate 16 frontier LLMs on TutorBench and present a detailed
analysis of their performance and behavior. Our results show that none of the
frontier LLMs achieve a score of greater than $56\%$, showing a large room for
improvement. We find that LLMs fall short in exhibiting the full range of
tutoring skills needed to guide, diagnose, and support students effectively,
with all the frontier models achieving less than a $60\%$ pass rate on rubric
criteria related to these skills. We also find that different model families
exhibit varied strengths and limitations: the Claude models outperform others
in supporting active learning, while they lag behind in the other two use
cases. By releasing TutorBench, we provide a comprehensive and unsaturated
benchmark to guide the development of the next-generation of AI tutors.

TL;DR: 该论文证明，对于一类置换等变学习规则（包括SGD、Adam等），训练过程在神经元之间诱导出双Lipschitz映射，并强烈约束神经元分布的拓扑结构。学习率大小决定了拓扑结构是否被保留：低于临界点η*时保留所有拓扑结构，高于η*时允许拓扑简化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究神经网络训练过程中神经元分布的拓扑变化规律，揭示学习率对拓扑结构的影响，为理解深度学习的学习机制提供新的理论视角。

Method: 通过数学分析证明置换等变学习规则在训练过程中诱导双Lipschitz映射，建立学习率与拓扑结构变化的关系理论框架。

Result: 发现学习率存在拓扑临界点η*，低于该值时训练保持所有拓扑结构，高于该值时允许拓扑简化，使神经元流形逐渐粗糙化。

Conclusion: 梯度下降下神经网络学习动态可分为两个阶段：首先在拓扑约束下进行平滑优化，然后进入通过拓扑简化学习的阶段。该理论独立于具体架构和损失函数，可普遍应用于深度学习研究。

Abstract: We prove that for a broad class of permutation-equivariant learning rules
(including SGD, Adam, and others), the training process induces a bi-Lipschitz
mapping between neurons and strongly constrains the topology of the neuron
distribution during training. This result reveals a qualitative difference
between small and large learning rates $\eta$. With a learning rate below a
topological critical point $\eta^*$, the training is constrained to preserve
all topological structure of the neurons. In contrast, above $\eta^*$, the
learning process allows for topological simplification, making the neuron
manifold progressively coarser and thereby reducing the model's expressivity.
Viewed in combination with the recent discovery of the edge of stability
phenomenon, the learning dynamics of neuron networks under gradient descent can
be divided into two phases: first they undergo smooth optimization under
topological constraints, and then enter a second phase where they learn through
drastic topological simplifications. A key feature of our theory is that it is
independent of specific architectures or loss functions, enabling the universal
application of topological methods to the study of deep learning.

Conclusion: 指数集中是训练模型的统计规律，为FP8时代的无损低精度浮点设计提供了原则性路径。

Abstract: The scaling of Generative AI (GenAI) models into the hundreds of billions of
parameters makes low-precision computation indispensable for efficient
deployment. We argue that the fundamental solution lies in developing
low-precision floating-point formats, which inherently provide numerical
stability, memory savings, and hardware efficiency without dequantization
overhead. In this paper, we present a theoretical and empirical study of an
exponent concentration phenomenon in GenAI weights: exponents consistently
exhibit low entropy across architectures and modalities. We show that this
arises naturally from $\alpha$-stable distributions induced by stochastic
gradient descent, and we prove tight bounds on the entropy of exponents. Our
analysis establishes a theoretical compression limit near FP4.67, which
motivates the design of a practical FP8 format. Building on these insights, we
propose Exponent-Concentrated FP8 (ECF8), a lossless compression framework with
entropy-aware encoding and GPU-optimized decoding. Experiments on LLMs and DiTs
up to 671B parameters demonstrate up to 26.9% memory savings and 177.1%
throughput acceleration, with perfectly lossless computations, i.e., no
deviation in model outputs. Our results establish exponent concentration as a
statistical law of trained models and open a principled path for lossless
low-precision floating-point design in the FP8 era.

Abstract: Recently, neural operators have emerged as powerful tools for learning
mappings between function spaces, enabling data-driven simulations of complex
dynamics. Despite their successes, a deeper understanding of their learning
mechanisms remains underexplored. In this work, we classify neural operators
into two types: (1) Spatial domain models that learn on grids and (2)
Functional domain models that learn with function bases. We present several
viewpoints based on this classification and focus on learning data-driven
dynamics adhering to physical principles. Specifically, we provide a way to
explain the prediction-making process of neural operators and show that neural
operator can learn hidden physical patterns from data. However, this
explanation method is limited to specific situations, highlighting the urgent
need for generalizable explanation methods. Next, we show that a simple
dual-space multi-scale model can achieve SOTA performance and we believe that
dual-space multi-spatio-scale models hold significant potential to learn
complex physics and require further investigation. Lastly, we discuss the
critical need for principled frameworks to incorporate known physics into
neural operators, enabling better generalization and uncovering more hidden
physical phenomena.

Abstract: Genetic programming (GP) has demonstrated strong effectiveness in evolving
tree-structured heuristics for complex optimization problems. Yet, in dynamic
and large-scale scenarios, the most effective heuristics are often highly
complex, hindering interpretability, slowing convergence, and limiting
transferability across tasks. To address these challenges, we present EvoSpeak,
a novel framework that integrates GP with large language models (LLMs) to
enhance the efficiency, transparency, and adaptability of heuristic evolution.
EvoSpeak learns from high-quality GP heuristics, extracts knowledge, and
leverages this knowledge to (i) generate warm-start populations that accelerate
convergence, (ii) translate opaque GP trees into concise natural-language
explanations that foster interpretability and trust, and (iii) enable knowledge
transfer and preference-aware heuristic generation across related tasks. We
verify the effectiveness of EvoSpeak through extensive experiments on dynamic
flexible job shop scheduling (DFJSS), under both single- and multi-objective
formulations. The results demonstrate that EvoSpeak produces more effective
heuristics, improves evolutionary efficiency, and delivers human-readable
reports that enhance usability. By coupling the symbolic reasoning power of GP
with the interpretative and generative strengths of LLMs, EvoSpeak advances the
development of intelligent, transparent, and user-aligned heuristics for
real-world optimization problems.

Motivation: 扩散模型虽然能有效捕捉训练数据分布，但需要根据下游应用通过奖励函数来塑造这些分布。现有的策略梯度方法（如PPO）在扩散模型中由于边缘似然难以处理而面临挑战。

Method: 1. 将RAFT变体统一为GRAFT框架，证明其隐式执行PPO；2. 引入P-GRAFT在中间噪声级别进行分布塑造；3. 提出逆噪声校正方法改进流模型。

Result: 在文本到图像生成、布局生成、分子生成和无条件图像生成等任务上验证。Stable Diffusion 2在T2I基准测试中VQAScore优于策略梯度方法，相对基础模型提升8.81%。无条件图像生成中，逆噪声校正以更低FLOPs/image改善了FID。

Conclusion: GRAFT框架为扩散模型提供了一种有效的分布塑造方法，P-GRAFT通过中间噪声级别的优化进一步提升了性能，逆噪声校正为无奖励场景下的模型改进提供了新思路。

Abstract: Diffusion models are widely used for generative tasks across domains. While
pre-trained diffusion models effectively capture the training data
distribution, it is often desirable to shape these distributions using reward
functions to align with downstream applications. Policy gradient methods, such
as Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), are widely used in the context of
autoregressive generation. However, the marginal likelihoods required for such
methods are intractable for diffusion models, leading to alternative proposals
and relaxations. In this context, we unify variants of Rejection sAmpling based
Fine-Tuning (RAFT) as GRAFT, and show that this implicitly performs PPO with
reshaped rewards. We then introduce P-GRAFT to shape distributions at
intermediate noise levels and demonstrate empirically that this can lead to
more effective fine-tuning. We mathematically explain this via a bias-variance
tradeoff. Motivated by this, we propose inverse noise correction to improve
flow models without leveraging explicit rewards. We empirically evaluate our
methods on text-to-image(T2I) generation, layout generation, molecule
generation and unconditional image generation. Notably, our framework, applied
to Stable Diffusion 2, improves over policy gradient methods on popular T2I
benchmarks in terms of VQAScore and shows an $8.81\%$ relative improvement over
the base model. For unconditional image generation, inverse noise correction
improves FID of generated images at lower FLOPs/image.

Result: 在Stochastic-D4RL任务上，RAMAC在大多数任务中保持强回报的同时，在CVaR0.1指标上获得一致增益。

Conclusion: RAMAC框架成功解决了离线强化学习中风险敏感性与策略表达能力之间的权衡问题。

Abstract: In safety-critical domains where online data collection is infeasible,
offline reinforcement learning (RL) offers an attractive alternative but only
if policies deliver high returns without incurring catastrophic lower-tail
risk. Prior work on risk-averse offline RL achieves safety at the cost of value
conservatism and restricted policy classes, whereas expressive policies are
only used in risk-neutral settings. Here, we address this gap by introducing
the \textbf{Risk-Aware Multimodal Actor-Critic (RAMAC)} framework, which
couples an \emph{expressive generative actor} with a distributional critic. The
RAMAC differentiates composite objective combining distributional risk and BC
loss through the generative path, achieving risk-sensitive learning in complex
multimodal scenarios. We instantiate RAMAC with diffusion and flow-matching
actors and observe consistent gains in $\mathrm{CVaR}_{0.1}$ while maintaining
strong returns on most Stochastic-D4RL tasks. Code:

Abstract: The growing integration of drones across commercial, industrial, and civilian
domains has introduced significant cybersecurity challenges, particularly due
to the susceptibility of drone networks to a wide range of cyberattacks.
Existing intrusion detection mechanisms often lack the adaptability,
efficiency, and generalizability required for the dynamic and resource

Anomaly Detection Dataset, consisting of more than 2.3 million labeled records,
demonstrate the superior performance of TSLT-Net with 99.99 percent accuracy in
multiclass detection and 100 percent in binary anomaly detection, while
maintaining a minimal memory footprint of only 0.04 MB and 9722 trainable

Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for spatial feature extraction,
Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Units (BiGRUs) for capturing temporal
dependencies, and a dual attention mechanism, channel and temporal attention,
to enhance focus on critical patterns in the data. The proposed method was
trained and evaluated on the Edge IIoTset dataset, a comprehensive and
realistic benchmark containing more than 2.2 million labeled instances spanning
15 attack types and benign traffic, collected from a seven layer industrial
testbed. Our proposed model achieves outstanding accuracy for both 15 attack
types and benign traffic. CST AFNet achieves 99.97 percent accuracy. Moreover,
this model demonstrates exceptional performance with macro averaged precision,
recall, and F1 score all above 99.3 percent. Experimental results show that CST
AFNet achieves superior detection accuracy, significantly outperforming
traditional deep learning models. The findings confirm that CST AFNet is a
powerful and scalable solution for real time cyber threat detection in complex
IoT and IIoT environments, paving the way for more secure, intelligent, and
adaptive cyber physical systems.

Abstract: Hyperparameters greatly impact models' capabilities; however, modern models
are too large for extensive search. Instead, researchers design recipes that
train well across scales based on their understanding of the hyperparameters.
Despite this importance, few tools exist for understanding the hyperparameter
loss surface. We discover novel structure in it and propose a new theory
yielding such tools. The loss surface is complex, but as you approach the
optimum simple structure emerges. It becomes characterized by a few basic
features, like its effective dimension and the best possible loss. To uncover
this asymptotic regime, we develop a novel technique based on random search.
Within this regime, the best scores from random search take on a new
distribution we discover. Its parameters are exactly the features defining the
loss surface in the asymptotic regime. From these features, we derive a new
asymptotic law for random search that can explain and extrapolate its
convergence. These new tools enable new analyses, such as confidence intervals
for the best possible performance or determining the effective number of
hyperparameters. We make these tools available at

Abstract: Deep time series forecasting has emerged as a booming direction in recent
years. Despite the exponential growth of community interests, researchers are
sometimes confused about the direction of their efforts due to minor
improvements on standard benchmarks. In this paper, we notice that, unlike
image recognition, whose well-acknowledged and realizable goal is 100%
accuracy, time series forecasting inherently faces a non-zero error lower bound
due to its partially observable and uncertain nature. To pinpoint the research
objective and release researchers from saturated tasks, this paper focuses on a
fundamental question: how to estimate the performance upper bound of deep time
series forecasting? Going beyond classical series-wise predictability metrics,
e.g., ADF test, we realize that the forecasting performance is highly related
to window-wise properties because of the sequence-to-sequence forecasting
paradigm of deep time series models. Based on rigorous statistical tests of
over 2,800 newly trained deep forecasters, we discover a significant
exponential relationship between the minimum forecasting error of deep models
and the complexity of window-wise series patterns, which is termed the accuracy
law. The proposed accuracy law successfully guides us to identify saturated
tasks from widely used benchmarks and derives an effective training strategy
for large time series models, offering valuable insights for future research.

Conclusion: 这是首个基于几何布朗运动和乘法更新的生物启发生成模型，为生物兼容的机器学习算法提供了新思路。

Abstract: Gradient descent has proven to be a powerful and effective technique for
optimization in numerous machine learning applications. Recent advances in
computational neuroscience have shown that learning in standard gradient
descent optimization formulation is not consistent with learning in biological
systems. This has opened up interesting avenues for building biologically
inspired learning techniques. One such approach is inspired by Dale's law,
which states that inhibitory and excitatory synapses do not swap roles during
the course of learning. The resulting exponential gradient descent optimization
scheme leads to log-normally distributed synaptic weights. Interestingly, the
density that satisfies the Fokker-Planck equation corresponding to the
stochastic differential equation (SDE) with geometric Brownian motion (GBM) is
the log-normal density. Leveraging this connection, we start with the SDE
governing geometric Brownian motion, and show that discretizing the
corresponding reverse-time SDE yields a multiplicative update rule, which
surprisingly, coincides with the sampling equivalent of the exponential
gradient descent update founded on Dale's law. Furthermore, we propose a new
formalism for multiplicative denoising score-matching, subsuming the loss
function proposed by Hyvaerinen for non-negative data. Indeed, log-normally
distributed data is positive and the proposed score-matching formalism turns
out to be a natural fit. This allows for training of score-based models for
image data and results in a novel multiplicative update scheme for sample
generation starting from a log-normal density. Experimental results on MNIST,
Fashion MNIST, and Kuzushiji datasets demonstrate generative capability of the
new scheme. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first instance of a
biologically inspired generative model employing multiplicative updates,
founded on geometric Brownian motion.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种新颖的鲁棒属性图聚类方法RAGC，通过混合协作增强和对比样本自适应差分感知来解决现有对比属性图聚类方法在边级嵌入增强和样本对处理方面的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对比属性图聚类方法主要依赖边作为辅助信息获取节点级嵌入表示，仅关注节点级嵌入增强，忽视了边级嵌入增强以及不同粒度下节点级和边级嵌入增强的交互作用。同时，它们通常平等对待所有对比样本对，忽略了难易正负样本对之间的显著差异，限制了判别能力。

Method: 提出RAGC方法，包含混合协作增强和对比样本自适应差分感知两个核心模块。HCA同时执行节点级和边级嵌入表示与增强，建立更全面的相似性度量标准；CSADA利用高置信度伪标签信息自适应识别所有对比样本对，并通过创新的权重调制函数差异化处理它们。两个模块在良性循环中相互增强。

Result: 在六个基准数据集上的综合图聚类评估表明，所提出的RAGC方法在多个最先进的CAGC方法中表现出有效性。

Conclusion: RAGC通过混合协作增强和对比样本自适应差分感知的协同作用，有效提升了表示学习的判别能力，在属性图聚类任务中取得了优越性能。

Abstract: Due to its powerful capability of self-supervised representation learning and
clustering, contrastive attributed graph clustering (CAGC) has achieved great
success, which mainly depends on effective data augmentation and contrastive
objective setting. However, most CAGC methods utilize edges as auxiliary
information to obtain node-level embedding representation and only focus on
node-level embedding augmentation. This approach overlooks edge-level embedding
augmentation and the interactions between node-level and edge-level embedding
augmentations across various granularity. Moreover, they often treat all
contrastive sample pairs equally, neglecting the significant differences
between hard and easy positive-negative sample pairs, which ultimately limits
their discriminative capability. To tackle these issues, a novel robust
attributed graph clustering (RAGC), incorporating hybrid-collaborative
augmentation (HCA) and contrastive sample adaptive-differential awareness
(CSADA), is proposed. First, node-level and edge-level embedding
representations and augmentations are simultaneously executed to establish a
more comprehensive similarity measurement criterion for subsequent contrastive
learning. In turn, the discriminative similarity further consciously guides
edge augmentation. Second, by leveraging pseudo-label information with high
confidence, a CSADA strategy is elaborately designed, which adaptively
identifies all contrastive sample pairs and differentially treats them by an
innovative weight modulation function. The HCA and CSADA modules mutually
reinforce each other in a beneficent cycle, thereby enhancing discriminability
in representation learning. Comprehensive graph clustering evaluations over six
benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed RAGC against
several state-of-the-art CAGC methods.

TL;DR: TokenFlow是一个新颖的LLM服务系统，通过抢占式请求调度和主动KV缓存管理来提升文本流式传输性能，显著提高了有效吞吐量并降低了首token延迟。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 实时LLM交互需要流式token生成，但现有系统由于非抢占式请求调度和被动内存管理导致资源利用率低、请求处理并行度差，特别是在请求突发时表现不佳。

Method: TokenFlow采用动态优先级调度（基于token缓冲区占用率和token消耗率）和主动KV缓存在GPU与CPU内存间传输，同时重叠I/O与计算以最小化抢占开销。

Result: 在Llama3-8B和Qwen2.5-32B模型上的实验表明，TokenFlow实现了高达82.5%的有效吞吐量提升，P99 TTFT降低达80.2%，且不降低整体token吞吐量。

Conclusion: TokenFlow通过创新的调度和缓存管理策略，显著提升了LLM服务的流式传输性能，在保持高吞吐量的同时大幅改善了响应性。

Abstract: Real-time LLM interactions demand streamed token generations, where text
tokens are progressively generated and delivered to users while balancing two
objectives: responsiveness (i.e., low time-to-first-token) and steady
generation (i.e.,required time-between-tokens). Standard LLM serving systems
suffer from the inflexibility caused by non-preemptive request scheduling and
reactive memory management, leading to poor resource utilization and low
request processing parallelism under request bursts. Therefore, we present
TokenFlow, a novel LLM serving system with enhanced text streaming performance
via preemptive request scheduling and proactive key-value (KV) cache
management. TokenFlow dynamically prioritizes requests based on real-time token
buffer occupancy and token consumption rate, while actively transferring KV
cache between GPU and CPU memory in the background and overlapping I/O with
computation to minimize request preemption overhead. Extensive experiments on
Llama3-8B and Qwen2.5-32B across multiple GPUs (RTX 4090, A6000, H200)
demonstrate that TokenFlow achieves up to 82.5% higher effective throughput
(accounting for actual user consumption) while reducing P99 TTFT by up to
80.2%, without degrading overall token throughput.

Abstract: We present a self-supervised machine learning framework for detecting and
mapping harmful algal bloom (HAB) severity and speciation using multi-sensor

MODIS, Sentinel-3, PACE) with TROPOMI solar-induced fluorescence (SIF), our
framework, called SIT-FUSE, generates HAB severity and speciation products
without requiring per-instrument labeled datasets. The framework employs
self-supervised representation learning, hierarchical deep clustering to
segment phytoplankton concentrations and speciations into interpretable
classes, validated against in-situ data from the Gulf of Mexico and Southern
California (2018-2025). Results show strong agreement with total phytoplankton,
Karenia brevis, Alexandrium spp., and Pseudo-nitzschia spp. measurements. This

enabling exploratory analysis via hierarchical embeddings: a critical step
toward operationalizing self-supervised learning for global aquatic

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Gradient-based algorithms are a cornerstone of artificial neural network
training, yet it remains unclear whether biological neural networks use similar
gradient-based strategies during learning. Experiments often discover a
diversity of synaptic plasticity rules, but whether these amount to an
approximation to gradient descent is unclear. Here we investigate a previously
overlooked possibility: that learning dynamics may include fundamentally
non-gradient "curl"-like components while still being able to effectively
optimize a loss function. Curl terms naturally emerge in networks with
inhibitory-excitatory connectivity or Hebbian/anti-Hebbian plasticity,
resulting in learning dynamics that cannot be framed as gradient descent on any
objective. To investigate the impact of these curl terms, we analyze
feedforward networks within an analytically tractable student-teacher
framework, systematically introducing non-gradient dynamics through neurons
exhibiting rule-flipped plasticity. Small curl terms preserve the stability of
the original solution manifold, resulting in learning dynamics similar to
gradient descent. Beyond a critical value, strong curl terms destabilize the
solution manifold. Depending on the network architecture, this loss of
stability can lead to chaotic learning dynamics that destroy performance. In
other cases, the curl terms can counterintuitively speed learning compared to
gradient descent by allowing the weight dynamics to escape saddles by
temporarily ascending the loss. Our results identify specific architectures
capable of supporting robust learning via diverse learning rules, providing an
important counterpoint to normative theories of gradient-based learning in
neural networks.

Abstract: Open-weight LLMs can be modified at inference time with simple activation
edits, which raises a practical question for safety: do common safety
interventions like refusal training or metatag training survive such edits? We
study model abliteration, a lightweight projection technique designed to remove
refusal-sensitive directions, and conduct a controlled evaluation across a
granular sequence of Safety Pretraining checkpoints for SmolLM2-1.7B, alongside
widely used open baselines. For each of 20 systems, original and abliterated,
we issue 100 prompts with balanced harmful and harmless cases, classify
responses as **Refusal** or **Non-Refusal** using multiple judges, and validate
judge fidelity on a small human-labeled subset. We also probe whether models
can identify refusal in their own outputs. Our study produces a
checkpoint-level characterization of which data-centric safety components
remain robust under abliteration, quantifies how judge selection influences
evaluation outcomes, and outlines a practical protocol for integrating
inference-time edits into safety assessments. Code:

Abstract: Recent advances have significantly improved our understanding of the
generalization performance of gradient descent (GD) methods in deep neural
networks. A natural and fundamental question is whether GD can achieve
generalization rates comparable to the minimax optimal rates established in the
kernel setting. Existing results either yield suboptimal rates of
$O(1/\sqrt{n})$, or focus on networks with smooth activation functions,
incurring exponential dependence on network depth $L$. In this work, we
establish optimal generalization rates for GD with deep ReLU networks by
carefully trading off optimization and generalization errors, achieving only
polynomial dependence on depth. Specifically, under the assumption that the
data are NTK separable from the margin $\gamma$, we prove an excess risk rate
of $\widetilde{O}(L^4 (1 + \gamma L^2) / (n \gamma^2))$, which aligns with the
optimal SVM-type rate $\widetilde{O}(1 / (n \gamma^2))$ up to depth-dependent
factors. A key technical contribution is our novel control of activation
patterns near a reference model, enabling a sharper Rademacher complexity bound
for deep ReLU networks trained with gradient descent.

Conclusion: 通过考虑预测区间的相关性而不仅仅是有效性，可以改进在线保形预测方法，产生更窄的预测区间，同时保持统计覆盖保证。

Abstract: Uncertainty quantification has received considerable interest in recent works
in Machine Learning. In particular, Conformal Prediction (CP) gains ground in
this field. For the case of time series, Online Conformal Prediction (OCP)
becomes an option to address the problem of data distribution shift over time.
Indeed, the idea of OCP is to update a threshold of some quantity (whether the
miscoverage level or the quantile) based on the distribution observation. To
evaluate the performance of OCP methods, two key aspects are typically
considered: the coverage validity and the prediction interval width
minimization. Recently, new OCP methods have emerged, offering long-run
coverage guarantees and producing more informative intervals. However, during
the threshold update step, most of these methods focus solely on the validity
of the prediction intervals~--~that is, whether the ground truth falls inside
or outside the interval~--~without accounting for their relevance. In this
paper, we aim to leverage this overlooked aspect. Specifically, we propose
enhancing the threshold update step by replacing the binary evaluation
(inside/outside) with a broader class of functions that quantify the relevance
of the prediction interval using the ground truth. This approach helps prevent
abrupt threshold changes, potentially resulting in narrower prediction
intervals. Indeed, experimental results on real-world datasets suggest that
these functions can produce tighter intervals compared to existing OCP methods
while maintaining coverage validity.

Abstract: The rapid adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) has raised significant
environmental concerns. Unlike the one-time cost of training, LLM inference
occurs continuously at a global scale and now dominates the AI energy
footprint. Yet, most sustainability studies report only coarse, model-level
metrics due to the lack of fine-grained measurement methods, treating energy
efficiency more as an afterthought than as a primary objective. We present the
first fine-grained empirical analysis of inference energy across core
components of transformer architecture. We propose a novel methodology,
Component-Level Energy Assessment via Repeated sampling (CLEAR), to overcome
temporal mismatch between microsecond scale component execution and monitoring
of millisecond (ms) scale energy sensors. Using CLEAR, we evaluate 15 models
spanning four distinct architecture types and consistently keep component-wise
energy variance below 9.5\% while capturing more than 90\% of the model's total
energy as individual components. Our empirical analysis reveals that Attention
blocks consume significantly more energy per floating-point operation (FLOP),
indicating that energy consumption is not proportionally aligned with FLOP
counts. This shows that FLOPs alone fail to capture the true energy cost at a
component level. Our findings establish detailed component-level energy
baselines and provide insight as an initial step to build energy-efficient
transformer models through component-level optimizations.

Abstract: Conventional supervised learning methods are often vulnerable to spurious
correlations, particularly under distribution shifts in test data. To address
this issue, several approaches, most notably Group DRO, have been developed.
While these methods are highly robust to subpopulation or group shifts, they
remain vulnerable to intra-group distributional shifts, which frequently occur
in minority groups with limited samples. We propose a hierarchical extension of
Group DRO that addresses both inter-group and intra-group uncertainties,
providing robustness to distribution shifts at multiple levels. We also
introduce new benchmark settings that simulate realistic minority group
distribution shifts-an important yet previously underexplored challenge in
spurious correlation research. Our method demonstrates strong robustness under
these conditions-where existing robust learning methods consistently fail-while
also achieving superior performance on standard benchmarks. These results
highlight the importance of broadening the ambiguity set to better capture both
inter-group and intra-group distributional uncertainties.

Motivation: 随机顺序模型中的输入序列虽然渐近等同于独立同分布数据，但在有限时间内可能表现出显著的非平稳性，这会阻碍随机学习算法的性能。

Method: 设计了一个通用模板来适配随机学习算法到随机顺序模型，不显著影响其遗憾保证。

Result: 恢复了延迟预测、带约束在线学习和切换成本赌博机的改进遗憾界，并证明在随机顺序下可学习性由VC维而非Littlestone维刻画。

Conclusion: 随机顺序模型提供了对抗模型和随机模型之间的中间地带，其可学习性特征与完全对抗设置不同。

Abstract: In the random-order model for online learning,
  the sequence of losses is chosen upfront by an adversary and presented to the
learner
  after a random permutation. Any random-order input is \emph{asymptotically}
equivalent to a stochastic i.i.d. one, but, for finite times, it may exhibit
significant {\em non-stationarity}, which can hinder the performance of
stochastic learning algorithms.
  While algorithms for adversarial inputs naturally maintain their regret
guarantees in random order, simple no-regret algorithms exist for the
stochastic model that fail against random-order instances.
  In this paper, we propose a general template to adapt stochastic learning
algorithms to the random-order model without substantially affecting their
regret guarantees. This allows us to recover improved regret bounds for
prediction with delays, online learning with constraints, and bandits with
switching costs. Finally, we investigate online classification and prove that,
in random order, learnability is characterized by the VC dimension rather than
the Littlestone dimension, thus providing a further separation from the general
adversarial model.

TL;DR: FlexiQ是一种自适应混合精度量化方案，通过选择性应用低比特计算到值范围小的特征通道，并实时调整低比特通道比例，在保持推理精度的同时有效处理波动的工作负载。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 神经网络通常在NPU和GPU等硬件加速器上运行，但这些加速器成本高昂且难以扩展资源来处理实时工作负载波动。

Method: FlexiQ采用自适应混合精度量化，选择性对值范围小的特征通道应用低比特计算，使用高效的比特降低方法最小化量化误差，并实时调整低比特通道比例。

Result: 在11个卷积和基于transformer的视觉模型上评估，FlexiQ在4位模型上平均精度提高6.6%，优于四种最先进的量化技术。50% 4位模型仅损失0.6%精度，达到100% 4位模型相对于8位模型40%的加速效果。

Conclusion: FlexiQ在NPU和GPU上引入最小运行时开销，证明了其硬件效率和整体性能优势，能够有效管理波动的推理工作负载。

Abstract: Neural networks commonly execute on hardware accelerators such as NPUs and
GPUs for their size and computation overhead. These accelerators are costly and
it is hard to scale their resources to handle real-time workload fluctuations.
  We present FlexiQ, an adaptive mixed-precision quantization scheme for
computer vision models. FlexiQ selectively applies low-bitwidth computation to
feature channels with small value ranges and employs an efficient bit-lowering
method to minimize quantization errors while maintaining inference accuracy.
Furthermore, FlexiQ adjusts its low-bitwidth channel ratio in real time,
enabling quantized models to effectively manage fluctuating inference workload.
  We implemented FlexiQ prototype, including the mixed-precision inference
runtime on our custom NPU and GPUs. Evaluated on eleven convolution- and
transformer-based vision models, FlexiQ achieves on average 6.6% higher
accuracy for 4-bit models with finetuning and outperforms four state-of-the-art
quantization techniques. Moreover, our mixed-precision models achieved an
efficient accuracy-latency trade-off, with the 50% 4-bit model incurring only
0.6% accuracy loss while achieving 40% of the speedup of the 100% 4-bit model
over 8-bit model. Latency evaluations on our NPU and GPUs confirmed that FlexiQ
introduces minimal runtime overhead, demonstrating its hardware efficiency and
overall performance benefits.

TL;DR: 提出一种在训练过程中对状态空间模型进行降维的方法，利用Hankel奇异值分析识别和保留高影响力维度，显著加速优化同时保持模型表达能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 状态空间模型在处理长序列任务时需要平衡表达能力和计算负担，传统方法难以在保持性能的同时实现高效计算。

Method: 基于控制理论的Hankel奇异值分析，在训练过程中识别高能量状态维度并进行平衡截断，适用于线性时不变SSM和选择性模型。

Result: 实验表明训练中降维显著加速优化，压缩模型保留了任务关键结构，性能优于直接训练的小维度模型。

Conclusion: 从大模型开始并在训练中缩小的SSM能够实现计算效率与高性能的平衡。

Abstract: State Space Models (SSMs), developed to tackle long sequence modeling tasks
efficiently, offer both parallelizable training and fast inference. At their
core are recurrent dynamical systems that maintain a hidden state, with update
costs scaling with the state dimension. A key design challenge is striking the
right balance between maximizing expressivity and limiting this computational
burden. Control theory, and more specifically Hankel singular value analysis,
provides a potent framework for the measure of energy for each state, as well
as the balanced truncation of the original system down to a smaller
representation with performance guarantees. Leveraging the eigenvalue stability
properties of Hankel matrices, we apply this lens to SSMs during training,
where only dimensions of high influence are identified and preserved. Our
approach applies to Linear Time-Invariant SSMs such as Linear Recurrent Units,
but is also extendable to selective models. Experiments show that in-training
reduction significantly accelerates optimization while preserving expressivity,
with compressed models retaining task-critical structure lost by models trained
directly at smaller dimension. In other words, SSMs that begin large and shrink
during training achieve computational efficiency while maintaining higher
performance.

TL;DR: 本文提出将视觉自回归模型重新解释为迭代精炼框架，通过前向过程构建拉普拉斯式潜在金字塔，后向过程在少量粗到细步骤中重建，连接了VAR与去噪扩散模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 重新审视VAR模型，将其从单纯的下一个尺度自回归视角扩展到迭代精炼框架，以解释其效率和保真度优势。

Method: 将VAR形式化为确定性前向过程构建潜在金字塔，配合学习的后向过程进行粗到细重建，在学习的潜在空间中进行精炼，将预测视为代码索引的离散分类，按空间频率划分任务。

Result: 通过受控实验量化了每个设计因素对保真度和速度的贡献，展示了框架在置换不变图生成和概率性中程天气预报中的扩展应用。

Conclusion: 该框架为VAR提供了实用接口，使其能够利用扩散生态系统工具，同时保持少步、尺度并行生成的优势。

Abstract: We revisit Visual Autoregressive (VAR) models through the lens of an
iterative-refinement framework. Rather than viewing VAR solely as next-scale
autoregression, we formalise it as a deterministic forward process that
constructs a Laplacian-style latent pyramid, paired with a learned backward
process that reconstructs it in a small number of coarse-to-fine steps. This
view connects VAR to denoising diffusion and isolates three design choices that
help explain its efficiency and fidelity: refining in a learned latent space,
casting prediction as discrete classification over code indices, and
partitioning the task by spatial frequency. We run controlled experiments to
quantify each factor's contribution to fidelity and speed, and we outline how
the same framework extends to permutation-invariant graph generation and to
probabilistic, ensemble-style medium-range weather forecasting. The framework
also suggests practical interfaces for VAR to leverage tools from the diffusion
ecosystem while retaining few-step, scale-parallel generation.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了SASL框架，一种可解释的个性化健康预测方法，结合稀疏线性模型和LightGBM，在保持可解释性的同时达到与黑盒方法相当的预测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度神经网络和梯度提升模型在预测健康结果时牺牲了可解释性，且未能充分处理个体间差异问题。

Method: 使用普通最小二乘回归与个体特异性交互项，通过迭代后向特征消除构建稀疏模型，并采用回归-阈值方法优化有序目标的F1分数，通过置信度门控机制选择性集成LightGBM输出。

Result: 在CH-2025数据集（10个受试者约450个日观测）上，SASL-LightGBM混合框架在预测性能上与复杂黑盒方法相当，但参数更少、透明度更高。

Conclusion: SASL框架在保持可解释性的同时实现了与黑盒方法相当的预测性能，为临床实践提供了清晰可操作的见解。

Abstract: Improved prediction of personalized health outcomes -- such as sleep quality
and stress -- from multimodal lifelog data could have meaningful clinical and
practical implications. However, state-of-the-art models, primarily deep neural
networks and gradient-boosted ensembles, sacrifice interpretability and fail to
adequately address the significant inter-individual variability inherent in
lifelog data. To overcome these challenges, we propose the Subject-Adaptive
Sparse Linear (SASL) framework, an interpretable modeling approach explicitly
designed for personalized health prediction. SASL integrates ordinary least
squares regression with subject-specific interactions, systematically
distinguishing global from individual-level effects. We employ an iterative
backward feature elimination method based on nested $F$-tests to construct a
sparse and statistically robust model. Additionally, recognizing that health
outcomes often represent discretized versions of continuous processes, we
develop a regression-then-thresholding approach specifically designed to
maximize macro-averaged F1 scores for ordinal targets. For intrinsically
challenging predictions, SASL selectively incorporates outputs from compact
LightGBM models through confidence-based gating, enhancing accuracy without
compromising interpretability. Evaluations conducted on the CH-2025 dataset --
which comprises roughly 450 daily observations from ten subjects -- demonstrate
that the hybrid SASL-LightGBM framework achieves predictive performance
comparable to that of sophisticated black-box methods, but with significantly
fewer parameters and substantially greater transparency, thus providing clear
and actionable insights for clinicians and practitioners.

TL;DR: Karma是一个知识感知的频率自适应学习模型，用于电池容量估计和剩余使用寿命预测，通过双流深度学习架构结合信号分解和知识引导，在电池健康预测方面比现有算法平均误差降低50.6%和32.6%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数据驱动模型虽然能捕捉时间退化特征，但缺乏知识指导，导致长期健康预测不可靠。电池退化行为复杂，存在非线性、噪声、容量再生等问题，需要更准确稳健的预测方法。

Method: 首先进行信号分解得到不同频段的电池信号；开发双流深度学习架构：一个流捕捉长期低频退化趋势，另一个流建模高频短期动态；用基于经验研究的双指数函数对电池退化进行知识建模；使用粒子滤波器优化知识参数，确保物理一致性和可靠预测。

Result: 在两个主流数据集上，Karma在电池健康预测方面比最先进算法平均误差分别降低50.6%和32.6%，显示出优越的性能。

Conclusion: Karma模型具有鲁棒性、泛化能力，能够为各种应用提供更安全可靠的电池管理，验证了知识引导和频率自适应学习在电池健康预测中的有效性。

Abstract: Battery health prognostics are critical for ensuring safety, efficiency, and
sustainability in modern energy systems. However, it has been challenging to
achieve accurate and robust prognostics due to complex battery degradation
behaviors with nonlinearity, noise, capacity regeneration, etc. Existing
data-driven models capture temporal degradation features but often lack
knowledge guidance, which leads to unreliable long-term health prognostics. To
overcome these limitations, we propose Karma, a knowledge-aware model with
frequency-adaptive learning for battery capacity estimation and remaining
useful life prediction. The model first performs signal decomposition to derive
battery signals in different frequency bands. A dual-stream deep learning
architecture is developed, where one stream captures long-term low-frequency
degradation trends and the other models high-frequency short-term dynamics.
Karma regulates the prognostics with knowledge, where battery degradation is
modeled as a double exponential function based on empirical studies. Our
dual-stream model is used to optimize the parameters of the knowledge with
particle filters to ensure physically consistent and reliable prognostics and
uncertainty quantification. Experimental study demonstrates Karma's superior
performance, achieving average error reductions of 50.6% and 32.6% over
state-of-the-art algorithms for battery health prediction on two mainstream
datasets, respectively. These results highlight Karma's robustness,
generalizability, and potential for safer and more reliable battery management
across diverse applications.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RoiRL是一种轻量级的离线强化学习方法，用于改进大型语言模型的推理能力，无需真实奖励标签，比在线方法TTRL训练快2.5倍且性能更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统强化学习需要真实奖励，而测试时强化学习(TTRL)虽然使用多数投票奖励但计算成本高。需要一种更高效的离线学习方法。

Method: 提出RoiRL方法，通过优化加权对数似然目标来替代在线RL，无需维护参考模型，显著降低内存和计算需求。

Result: 实验显示RoiRL训练速度比TTRL快2.5倍，在推理基准测试中表现一致优于TTRL。

Conclusion: RoiRL为无标签自改进LLMs提供了一条可扩展的路径，实现了稳定高效的离线强化学习。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) is central to improving reasoning in large
language models (LLMs) but typically requires ground-truth rewards. Test-Time
Reinforcement Learning (TTRL) removes this need by using majority-vote rewards,
but relies on heavy online RL and incurs substantial computational cost. We
propose RoiRL: Reasoning with offline iterative Reinforcement Learning, a
family of lightweight offline learning alternatives that can target the same
regularized optimal policies. Unlike TTRL, RoiRL eliminates the need to
maintain a reference model and instead optimizes weighted log-likelihood
objectives, enabling stable training with significantly lower memory and
compute requirements. Experimental results show that RoiRL trains to 2.5x
faster and consistently outperforms TTRL on reasoning benchmarks, establishing
a scalable path to self-improving LLMs without labels.

TL;DR: 提出了首个专门为扩散大语言模型设计的水印框架DMark，解决了传统水印方法因扩散模型的非顺序解码而失效的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散大语言模型生成速度更快但保持相似质量，但现有水印方法因其非顺序解码而失效，需要专门的水印解决方案。

Method: DMark采用三种互补策略：预测性水印（使用模型预测的令牌）、双向水印（利用扩散解码特有的前后依赖关系）、以及预测-双向水印（结合两者最大化检测强度）。

Result: 实验显示DMark在1%误报率下达到92.0-99.5%的检测率，而现有方法适应版仅为49.6-71.2%，同时保持文本质量。

Conclusion: DMark证明了对非自回归语言模型进行有效水印是可行的，且对文本操作具有鲁棒性。

Abstract: Diffusion large language models (dLLMs) offer faster generation than
autoregressive models while maintaining comparable quality, but existing
watermarking methods fail on them due to their non-sequential decoding. Unlike
autoregressive models that generate tokens left-to-right, dLLMs can finalize
tokens in arbitrary order, breaking the causal design underlying traditional
watermarks. We present DMark, the first watermarking framework designed
specifically for dLLMs. DMark introduces three complementary strategies to
restore watermark detectability: predictive watermarking uses model-predicted
tokens when actual context is unavailable; bidirectional watermarking exploits
both forward and backward dependencies unique to diffusion decoding; and
predictive-bidirectional watermarking combines both approaches to maximize
detection strength. Experiments across multiple dLLMs show that DMark achieves
92.0-99.5% detection rates at 1% false positive rate while maintaining text
quality, compared to only 49.6-71.2% for naive adaptations of existing methods.
DMark also demonstrates robustness against text manipulations, establishing
that effective watermarking is feasible for non-autoregressive language models.

Motivation: 当前最先进的细胞分化动态模型依赖计算昂贵的预处理和多阶段训练，且无法发现明确的基因相互作用。

Method: 使用编码器-解码器架构，潜在表示是局部线性化的ODE，完全端到端训练（除标准PCA预处理外），学习生物一致且可解释的基因相互作用。

Conclusion: Cell-MNN是一个有前景的模型，能够有效建模细胞分化动态，同时提供可解释的基因相互作用分析。

Abstract: Modeling the dynamics of cellular differentiation is fundamental to advancing
the understanding and treatment of diseases associated with this process, such
as cancer. With the rapid growth of single-cell datasets, this has also become
a particularly promising and active domain for machine learning. Current
state-of-the-art models, however, rely on computationally expensive optimal
transport preprocessing and multi-stage training, while also not discovering
explicit gene interactions. To address these challenges we propose
Cell-Mechanistic Neural Networks (Cell-MNN), an encoder-decoder architecture
whose latent representation is a locally linearized ODE governing the dynamics
of cellular evolution from stem to tissue cells. Cell-MNN is fully end-to-end
(besides a standard PCA pre-processing) and its ODE representation explicitly
learns biologically consistent and interpretable gene interactions.
Empirically, we show that Cell-MNN achieves competitive performance on
single-cell benchmarks, surpasses state-of-the-art baselines in scaling to
larger datasets and joint training across multiple datasets, while also
learning interpretable gene interactions that we validate against the TRRUST
database of gene interactions.

Motivation: 解决联邦学习在非IID设置下性能下降和公平性问题，特别是提升表现不佳客户端的训练效果。

Method: 结合多类AdaBoost算法的权重机制，为本地错误率较低的客户端分配更高权重；同时动态增强表现不佳的客户端，通过调整焦点损失参数来强调难以分类的样本。

Result: 在MNIST、FEMNIST和CIFAR10三个基准数据集上的评估表明，FeDABoost相比FedAvg和Ditto实现了更好的公平性和竞争性性能。

Conclusion: FeDABoost框架有效提升了联邦学习在非IID设置下的公平性和整体性能，为联邦学习系统提供了更可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: This work focuses on improving the performance and fairness of Federated
Learning (FL) in non IID settings by enhancing model aggregation and boosting
the training of underperforming clients. We propose FeDABoost, a novel FL
framework that integrates a dynamic boosting mechanism and an adaptive gradient
aggregation strategy. Inspired by the weighting mechanism of the Multiclass
AdaBoost (SAMME) algorithm, our aggregation method assigns higher weights to
clients with lower local error rates, thereby promoting more reliable
contributions to the global model. In parallel, FeDABoost dynamically boosts
underperforming clients by adjusting the focal loss focusing parameter,
emphasizing hard to classify examples during local training. We have evaluated
FeDABoost on three benchmark datasets MNIST, FEMNIST, and CIFAR10, and compared
its performance with those of FedAvg and Ditto. The results show that FeDABoost
achieves improved fairness and competitive performance.

Result: 在四个医疗中心收集的iEEG记录上评估，实现了有竞争力的分类性能，并为从业者提供了更高的透明度和可解释性。

Conclusion: 该方法展示了在可靠且可解释的临床变长时间序列分类方面的潜力。

Abstract: Medical time series analysis is challenging due to data sparsity, noise, and
highly variable recording lengths. Prior work has shown that stochastic sparse
sampling effectively handles variable-length signals, while retrieval-augmented
approaches improve explainability and robustness to noise and weak temporal
correlations. In this study, we generalize the stochastic sparse sampling
framework for retrieval-informed classification. Specifically, we weight window
predictions by within-channel similarity and aggregate them in probability
space, yielding convex series-level scores and an explicit evidence trail for
explainability. Our method achieves competitive iEEG classification performance
and provides practitioners with greater transparency and explainability. We
evaluate our method in iEEG recordings collected in four medical centers,
demonstrating its potential for reliable and explainable clinical
variable-length time series classification.

Conclusion: 遍历风险度量为风险感知持续强化学习提供了理论基础，解决了传统风险度量在持续学习中的不兼容问题，具有理论和实践价值。

Abstract: Continual reinforcement learning (continual RL) seeks to formalize the
notions of lifelong learning and endless adaptation in RL. In particular, the
aim of continual RL is to develop RL agents that can maintain a careful balance
between retaining useful information and adapting to new situations. To date,
continual RL has been explored almost exclusively through the lens of
risk-neutral decision-making, in which the agent aims to optimize the expected
(or mean) long-run performance. In this work, we present the first formal
theoretical treatment of continual RL through the lens of risk-aware
decision-making, in which the agent aims to optimize a reward-based measure of
long-run performance beyond the mean. In particular, we show that the classical
theory of risk measures, widely used as a theoretical foundation in
non-continual risk-aware RL, is, in its current form, incompatible with the
continual setting. Then, building on this insight, we extend risk measure
theory into the continual setting by introducing a new class of ergodic risk
measures that are compatible with continual learning. Finally, we provide a
case study of risk-aware continual learning, along with empirical results,
which show the intuitive appeal and theoretical soundness of ergodic risk
measures.

Abstract: Inferring trajectories from longitudinal spatially-resolved omics data is
fundamental to understanding the dynamics of structural and functional tissue
changes in development, regeneration and repair, disease progression, and
response to treatment. We propose ContextFlow, a novel context-aware flow
matching framework that incorporates prior knowledge to guide the inference of
structural tissue dynamics from spatially resolved omics data. Specifically,
ContextFlow integrates local tissue organization and ligand-receptor
communication patterns into a transition plausibility matrix that regularizes
the optimal transport objective. By embedding these contextual constraints,
ContextFlow generates trajectories that are not only statistically consistent
but also biologically meaningful, making it a generalizable framework for
modeling spatiotemporal dynamics from longitudinal, spatially resolved omics
data. Evaluated on three datasets, ContextFlow consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art flow matching methods across multiple quantitative and
qualitative metrics of inference accuracy and biological coherence. Our code is

Motivation: 在现实部署中，当标记测试数据不可用时，评估模型在分布偏移下的泛化能力至关重要。需要解决两种常见部署场景：固定模型在多个无标签测试集上的准确率估计，以及候选模型在单个无标签测试集上的排名。

Method: 利用模型预测的两个内在属性：置信度（反映预测确定性）和分散度（捕获预测类别的多样性），系统性地评估基于置信度、分散度以及混合指标的多种度量方法。

Abstract: Assessing model generalization under distribution shift is essential for
real-world deployment, particularly when labeled test data is unavailable. This
paper presents a unified and practical framework for unsupervised model
evaluation and ranking in two common deployment settings: (1) estimating the
accuracy of a fixed model on multiple unlabeled test sets (dataset-centric
evaluation), and (2) ranking a set of candidate models on a single unlabeled
test set (model-centric evaluation). We demonstrate that two intrinsic
properties of model predictions, namely confidence (which reflects prediction
certainty) and dispersity (which captures the diversity of predicted classes),
together provide strong and complementary signals for generalization. We
systematically benchmark a set of confidence-based, dispersity-based, and
hybrid metrics across a wide range of model architectures, datasets, and
distribution shift types. Our results show that hybrid metrics consistently
outperform single-aspect metrics on both dataset-centric and model-centric
evaluation settings. In particular, the nuclear norm of the prediction matrix
provides robust and accurate performance across tasks, including real-world
datasets, and maintains reliability under moderate class imbalance. These
findings offer a practical and generalizable basis for unsupervised model
assessment in deployment scenarios.

Abstract: With the growth of global maritime transportation, energy optimization has
become crucial for reducing costs and ensuring operational efficiency. Shaft
power is the mechanical power transmitted from the engine to the shaft and
directly impacts fuel consumption, making its accurate prediction a paramount
step in optimizing vessel performance. Power consumption is highly correlated
with ship parameters such as speed and shaft rotation per minute, as well as
weather and sea conditions. Frequent access to this operational data can
improve prediction accuracy. However, obtaining high-quality sensor data is
often infeasible and costly, making alternative sources such as noon reports a
viable option. In this paper, we propose a transfer learning-based approach for
predicting vessels shaft power, where a model is initially trained on
high-frequency data from a vessel and then fine-tuned with low-frequency daily
noon reports from other vessels. We tested our approach on sister vessels
(identical dimensions and configurations), a similar vessel (slightly larger
with a different engine), and a different vessel (distinct dimensions and
configurations). The experiments showed that the mean absolute percentage error
decreased by 10.6 percent for sister vessels, 3.6 percent for a similar vessel,
and 5.3 percent for a different vessel, compared to the model trained solely on
noon report data.

Abstract: The development of diagnostic models is gaining traction in the field of
psychiatric disorders. Recently, machine learning classifiers based on
resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) have been
developed to identify brain biomarkers that differentiate psychiatric disorders
from healthy controls. However, conventional machine learning-based diagnostic
models often depend on extensive feature engineering, which introduces bias
through manual intervention. While deep learning models are expected to operate
without manual involvement, their lack of interpretability poses significant
challenges in obtaining explainable and reliable brain biomarkers to support
diagnostic decisions, ultimately limiting their clinical applicability. In this
study, we introduce an end-to-end innovative graph neural network framework
named BrainIB++, which applies the information bottleneck (IB) principle to
identify the most informative data-driven brain regions as subgraphs during
model training for interpretation. We evaluate the performance of our model
against nine established brain network classification methods across three
multi-cohort schizophrenia datasets. It consistently demonstrates superior
diagnostic accuracy and exhibits generalizability to unseen data. Furthermore,
the subgraphs identified by our model also correspond with established clinical
biomarkers in schizophrenia, particularly emphasizing abnormalities in the
visual, sensorimotor, and higher cognition brain functional network. This
alignment enhances the model's interpretability and underscores its relevance
for real-world diagnostic applications.

Result: 在合成基准、真实世界神经行为数据和MuJoCo控制任务上的实验表明，该方法能够恢复表达性奖励表示并实现最先进的模仿性能。

Conclusion: 该框架适用于行为分析和风险感知模仿学习，能够捕捉专家行为中更丰富的结构特征。

Abstract: We propose a distributional framework for offline Inverse Reinforcement
Learning (IRL) that jointly models uncertainty over reward functions and full
distributions of returns. Unlike conventional IRL approaches that recover a
deterministic reward estimate or match only expected returns, our method
captures richer structure in expert behavior, particularly in learning the
reward distribution, by minimizing first-order stochastic dominance (FSD)
violations and thus integrating distortion risk measures (DRMs) into policy
learning, enabling the recovery of both reward distributions and
distribution-aware policies. This formulation is well-suited for behavior
analysis and risk-aware imitation learning. Empirical results on synthetic
benchmarks, real-world neurobehavioral data, and MuJoCo control tasks
demonstrate that our method recovers expressive reward representations and
achieves state-of-the-art imitation performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Method: 基于似然最大化推导框架，将目标分解为生成组件（建模模糊标签分布）和分类组件（使用扩散分类器推断类后验概率），并通过优化的时间步采样策略提高效率。

Conclusion: DMIS是扩散模型中首个系统研究模糊监督问题的框架，能有效处理各种不精确监督形式，提升生成质量。

Abstract: Conditional diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in various
generative tasks recently, but their training typically relies on large-scale
datasets that inevitably contain imprecise information in conditional inputs.
Such supervision, often stemming from noisy, ambiguous, or incomplete labels,
will cause condition mismatch and degrade generation quality. To address this
challenge, we propose DMIS, a unified framework for training robust Diffusion
Models from Imprecise Supervision, which is the first systematic study within
diffusion models. Our framework is derived from likelihood maximization and
decomposes the objective into generative and classification components: the
generative component models imprecise-label distributions, while the
classification component leverages a diffusion classifier to infer
class-posterior probabilities, with its efficiency further improved by an
optimized timestep sampling strategy. Extensive experiments on diverse forms of
imprecise supervision, covering tasks of image generation, weakly supervised
learning, and noisy dataset condensation demonstrate that DMIS consistently
produces high-quality and class-discriminative samples.

Abstract: The Wasserstein barycenter is defined as the mean of a set of probability
measures under the optimal transport metric, and has numerous applications
spanning machine learning, statistics, and computer graphics. In practice these

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: EEG信号样本具有固有的反相关性，可以通过符号图中的负边很好地建模。为了区分癫痫患者和健康受试者，需要构建轻量级且可解释的神经网络模型。

Method: 构建轻量级Transformer网络，通过展开平衡符号图上的谱去噪算法实现。利用平衡符号图的频率映射到对应正图，通过Lanczos近似实现理想低通滤波器，从数据中学习最优截止频率。

Result: 实验表明该方法在分类性能上与代表性深度学习方案相当，但使用的参数数量显著减少。

Conclusion: 该方法实现了与深度学习方法相当的分类性能，同时具有参数少、可解释性强的优点，为EEG信号分析提供了有效的轻量级解决方案。

Abstract: Samples of brain signals collected by EEG sensors have inherent
anti-correlations that are well modeled by negative edges in a finite graph. To
differentiate epilepsy patients from healthy subjects using collected EEG
signals, we build lightweight and interpretable transformer-like neural nets by
unrolling a spectral denoising algorithm for signals on a balanced signed graph
-- graph with no cycles of odd number of negative edges. A balanced signed
graph has well-defined frequencies that map to a corresponding positive graph
via similarity transform of the graph Laplacian matrices. We implement an ideal
low-pass filter efficiently on the mapped positive graph via Lanczos
approximation, where the optimal cutoff frequency is learned from data. Given
that two balanced signed graph denoisers learn posterior probabilities of two
different signal classes during training, we evaluate their reconstruction
errors for binary classification of EEG signals. Experiments show that our
method achieves classification performance comparable to representative deep
learning schemes, while employing dramatically fewer parameters.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了CHORD框架，通过设备-云协作实现个性化混合精度量化，在移动设备上部署重排序模型，同时实现个性化偏好捕捉和资源自适应部署。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 移动设备能力提升使得在设备上直接部署重排序模型成为可能，但资源异构性需要模型压缩。现有量化方法忽略了设备特定用户兴趣，导致推荐准确性下降；而设备端微调虽然能捕获个性化偏好，但带来额外的计算负担。

Method: CHORD框架在异构设备上分发随机初始化模型，通过云端的辅助超网络模块识别用户特定关键参数。采用多粒度参数敏感性分析（层级、过滤器级和元素级），将用户画像映射到量化策略。通过设备端混合精度量化实现动态模型适配和加速推理，无需反向传播。

Result: 在三个真实世界数据集和两个流行骨干网络（SASRec和Caser）上的实验证明了CHORD的准确性、效率和适应性。通过仅使用每通道2位编码量化策略而非32位权重，最小化了通信开销。

Conclusion: CHORD框架成功解决了设备端模型部署中的个性化与资源自适应平衡问题，通过设备-云协作实现了无需重训练的高效个性化推荐。

Abstract: With the advancement of mobile device capabilities, deploying reranking
models directly on devices has become feasible, enabling real-time contextual
recommendations. When migrating models from cloud to devices, resource
heterogeneity inevitably necessitates model compression. Recent quantization
methods show promise for efficient deployment, yet they overlook
device-specific user interests, resulting in compromised recommendation
accuracy. While on-device finetuning captures personalized user preference, it
imposes additional computational burden through local retraining. To address
these challenges, we propose a framework for \underline{\textbf{C}}ustomizing
\underline{\textbf{H}}ybrid-precision \underline{\textbf{O}}n-device model for
sequential \underline{\textbf{R}}ecommendation with
\underline{\textbf{D}}evice-cloud collaboration (\textbf{CHORD}), leveraging
channel-wise mixed-precision quantization to simultaneously achieve
personalization and resource-adaptive deployment. CHORD distributes randomly
initialized models across heterogeneous devices and identifies user-specific
critical parameters through auxiliary hypernetwork modules on the cloud. Our
parameter sensitivity analysis operates across multiple granularities (layer,
filter, and element levels), enabling precise mapping from user profiles to
quantization strategy. Through on-device mixed-precision quantization, CHORD
delivers dynamic model adaptation and accelerated inference without
backpropagation, eliminating costly retraining cycles. We minimize
communication overhead by encoding quantization strategies using only 2 bits
per channel instead of 32-bit weights. Experiments on three real-world datasets
with two popular backbones (SASRec and Caser) demonstrate the accuracy,
efficiency, and adaptivity of CHORD.

Conclusion: 贝叶斯等变神经网络为开发具有不确定性感知的大规模原子模拟MLPs提供了强大框架。

Abstract: Machine learning potentials (MLPs) have become essential for large-scale
atomistic simulations, enabling ab initio-level accuracy with computational
efficiency. However, current MLPs struggle with uncertainty quantification,
limiting their reliability for active learning, calibration, and
out-of-distribution (OOD) detection. We address these challenges by developing
Bayesian E(3) equivariant MLPs with iterative restratification of many-body
message passing. Our approach introduces the joint energy-force negative
log-likelihood (NLL$_\text{JEF}$) loss function, which explicitly models
uncertainty in both energies and interatomic forces, yielding superior accuracy
compared to conventional NLL losses. We systematically benchmark multiple
Bayesian approaches, including deep ensembles with mean-variance estimation,
stochastic weight averaging Gaussian, improved variational online Newton, and
laplace approximation by evaluating their performance on uncertainty
prediction, OOD detection, calibration, and active learning tasks. We further
demonstrate that NLL$_\text{JEF}$ facilitates efficient active learning by
quantifying energy and force uncertainties. Using Bayesian active learning by
disagreement (BALD), our framework outperforms random sampling and
energy-uncertainty-based sampling. Our results demonstrate that Bayesian MLPs
achieve competitive accuracy with state-of-the-art models while enabling
uncertainty-guided active learning, OOD detection, and energy/forces
calibration. This work establishes Bayesian equivariant neural networks as a
powerful framework for developing uncertainty-aware MLPs for atomistic
simulations at scale.

Abstract: Global optimization of expensive, derivative-free black-box functions
requires extreme sample efficiency. While Bayesian optimization (BO) is the
current state-of-the-art, its performance hinges on surrogate and acquisition
function hyper-parameters that are often hand-tuned and fail to generalize
across problem landscapes. We present ZeroShotOpt, a general-purpose,
pretrained model for continuous black-box optimization tasks ranging from 2D to
20D. Our approach leverages offline reinforcement learning on large-scale
optimization trajectories collected from 12 BO variants. To scale pretraining,
we generate millions of synthetic Gaussian process-based functions with diverse
landscapes, enabling the model to learn transferable optimization policies. As
a result, ZeroShotOpt achieves robust zero-shot generalization on a wide array
of unseen benchmarks, matching or surpassing the sample efficiency of leading
global optimizers, including BO, while also offering a reusable foundation for
future extensions and improvements. Our open-source code, dataset, and model

Conclusion: UD3RL框架有效解决了接近旅行商问题，在性能、泛化能力和鲁棒性方面表现出色，为这类复杂组合优化问题提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: In recent years, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has gained traction for
solving the NP-hard traveling salesman problem (TSP). However, limited
attention has been given to the close-enough TSP (CETSP), primarily due to the
challenge introduced by its neighborhood-based visitation criterion, wherein a
node is considered visited if the agent enters a compact neighborhood around
it. In this work, we formulate a Markov decision process (MDP) for CETSP using
a discretization scheme and propose a novel unified dual-decoder DRL (UD3RL)
framework that separates decision-making into node selection and waypoint
determination. Specifically, an adapted encoder is employed for effective
feature extraction, followed by a node-decoder and a loc-decoder to handle the
two sub-tasks, respectively. A k-nearest neighbors subgraph interaction
strategy is further introduced to enhance spatial reasoning during location
decoding. Furthermore, we customize the REINFORCE algorithm to train UD3RL as a
unified model capable of generalizing across different problem sizes and
varying neighborhood radius types (i.e., constant and random radii).
Experimental results show that UD3RL outperforms conventional methods in both
solution quality and runtime, while exhibiting strong generalization across
problem scales, spatial distributions, and radius ranges, as well as robustness
to dynamic environments.

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) have struggled to outperform traditional
optimization methods on combinatorial problems, limiting their practical
impact. We address this gap by introducing a novel chaining procedure for the
graph alignment problem, a fundamental NP-hard task of finding optimal node
correspondences between unlabeled graphs using only structural information. Our
method trains a sequence of GNNs where each network learns to iteratively
refine similarity matrices produced by previous networks. During inference,
this creates a bootstrap effect: each GNN improves upon partial solutions by
incorporating discrete ranking information about node alignment quality from
prior iterations. We combine this with a powerful architecture that operates on
node pairs rather than individual nodes, capturing global structural patterns
essential for alignment that standard message-passing networks cannot
represent. Extensive experiments on synthetic benchmarks demonstrate
substantial improvements: our chained GNNs achieve over 3x better accuracy than
existing methods on challenging instances, and uniquely solve regular graphs
where all competing approaches fail. When combined with traditional
optimization as post-processing, our method substantially outperforms
state-of-the-art solvers on the graph alignment benchmark.

Motivation: 扩散和流模型在蛋白质骨架生成任务中表现出色，但生成速度慢（需要数百步迭代），限制了在大规模蛋白质发现中的实际应用。

Conclusion: 该方法显著降低了推理成本，使基于扩散的模型更接近实际的蛋白质工程应用，实现了大规模计算机辅助蛋白质设计。

Abstract: Diffusion- and flow-based generative models have recently demonstrated strong
performance in protein backbone generation tasks, offering unprecedented
capabilities for de novo protein design. However, while achieving notable
performance in generation quality, these models are limited by their generating
speed, often requiring hundreds of iterative steps in the reverse-diffusion
process. This computational bottleneck limits their practical utility in
large-scale protein discovery, where thousands to millions of candidate
structures are needed. To address this challenge, we explore the techniques of
score distillation, which has shown great success in reducing the number of
sampling steps in the vision domain while maintaining high generation quality.
However, a straightforward adaptation of these methods results in unacceptably
low designability. Through extensive study, we have identified how to
appropriately adapt Score identity Distillation (SiD), a state-of-the-art score
distillation strategy, to train few-step protein backbone generators which
significantly reduce sampling time, while maintaining comparable performance to
their pretrained teacher model. In particular, multistep generation combined
with inference time noise modulation is key to the success. We demonstrate that
our distilled few-step generators achieve more than a 20-fold improvement in
sampling speed, while achieving similar levels of designability, diversity, and
novelty as the Proteina teacher model. This reduction in inference cost enables
large-scale in silico protein design, thereby bringing diffusion-based models
closer to real-world protein engineering applications.

Conclusion: 提出的基于干预的自适应特征选择方法能够有效识别和移除不必要的节点特征，提高图神经网络的性能和可解释性，同时适应不同的图学习场景。

Abstract: We propose an adaptive node feature selection approach for graph neural
networks (GNNs) that identifies and removes unnecessary features during
training. The ability to measure how features contribute to model output is key
for interpreting decisions, reducing dimensionality, and even improving
performance by eliminating unhelpful variables. However, graph-structured data
introduces complex dependencies that may not be amenable to classical feature
importance metrics. Inspired by this challenge, we present a model- and
task-agnostic method that determines relevant features during training based on
changes in validation performance upon permuting feature values. We
theoretically motivate our intervention-based approach by characterizing how
GNN performance depends on the relationships between node data and graph
structure. Not only do we return feature importance scores once training
concludes, we also track how relevance evolves as features are successively
dropped. We can therefore monitor if features are eliminated effectively and
also evaluate other metrics with this technique. Our empirical results verify
the flexibility of our approach to different graph architectures as well as its
adaptability to more challenging graph learning settings.

Result: 在16对基准模型和数据集上评估，AdaBet比基于梯度的方法平均分类准确率提高5%，平均峰值内存消耗减少40%。

Conclusion: AdaBet提供了一种无需梯度的层选择方法，能够在资源受限的设备上实现高效的模型重训练和适应。

Abstract: To utilize pre-trained neural networks on edge and mobile devices, we often
require efficient adaptation to user-specific runtime data distributions while
operating under limited compute and memory resources. On-device retraining with
a target dataset can facilitate such adaptations; however, it remains
impractical due to the increasing depth of modern neural nets, as well as the
computational overhead associated with gradient-based optimization across all
layers. Current approaches reduce training cost by selecting a subset of layers
for retraining, however, they rely on labeled data, at least one full-model
backpropagation, or server-side meta-training; limiting their suitability for
constrained devices. We introduce AdaBet, a gradient-free layer selection
approach to rank important layers by analyzing topological features of their
activation spaces through Betti Numbers and using forward passes alone. AdaBet
allows selecting layers with high learning capacity, which are important for
retraining and adaptation, without requiring labels or gradients. Evaluating
AdaBet on sixteen pairs of benchmark models and datasets, shows AdaBet achieves
an average gain of 5% more classification accuracy over gradient-based
baselines while reducing average peak memory consumption by 40%.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提高城市地铁系统的实时调度效率，确保服务可靠性，最大化资源利用，提升乘客满意度。

Result: 在大规模地铁线路数据集上验证，模型表现出良好的间隔预测能力，为实时决策提供可行见解。

Conclusion: 该框架为铁路运营商提供了强大且计算高效的工具，可优化调度策略，显著改善服务一致性和乘客满意度。

Abstract: Efficient real-time dispatching in urban metro systems is essential for
ensuring service reliability, maximizing resource utilization, and improving
passenger satisfaction. This study presents a novel deep learning framework
centered on a Convolutional Long Short-Term Memory (ConvLSTM) model designed to
predict the complex spatiotemporal propagation of train headways across an
entire metro line. By directly incorporating planned terminal headways as a
critical input alongside historical headway data, the proposed model accurately
forecasts future headway dynamics, effectively capturing both their temporal
evolution and spatial dependencies across all stations. This capability
empowers dispatchers to evaluate the impact of various terminal headway control
decisions without resorting to computationally intensive simulations. We
introduce a flexible methodology to simulate diverse dispatcher strategies,
ranging from maintaining even headways to implementing custom patterns derived
from observed terminal departures. In contrast to existing research primarily
focused on passenger load predictioning or atypical disruption scenarios, our
approach emphasizes proactive operational control. Evaluated on a large-scale
dataset from an urban metro line, the proposed ConvLSTM model demonstrates
promising headway predictions, offering actionable insights for real-time
decision-making. This framework provides rail operators with a powerful,
computationally efficient tool to optimize dispatching strategies, thereby
significantly improving service consistency and passenger satisfaction.

Conclusion: 投资组合感知目标和几何感知归纳偏差对于机器学习系统中的风险感知资本分配至关重要。

Abstract: Robust asset allocation is a key challenge in quantitative finance, where
deep-learning forecasters often fail due to objective mismatch and error
amplification. We introduce the Signature-Informed Transformer (SIT), a novel
framework that learns end-to-end allocation policies by directly optimizing a
risk-aware financial objective. SIT's core innovations include path signatures
for a rich geometric representation of asset dynamics and a signature-augmented
attention mechanism embedding financial inductive biases, like lead-lag
effects, into the model. Evaluated on daily S\&P 100 equity data, SIT
decisively outperforms traditional and deep-learning baselines, especially when
compared to predict-then-optimize models. These results indicate that
portfolio-aware objectives and geometry-aware inductive biases are essential
for risk-aware capital allocation in machine-learning systems. The code is

Abstract: Explainable Artificial Intelligence has become a crucial area of research,
aiming to demystify the decision-making processes of deep learning models.
Among various explainability techniques, counterfactual explanations have been
proven particularly promising, as they offer insights into model behavior by
highlighting minimal changes that would alter a prediction. Despite their
potential, these explanations are often complex and technical, making them
difficult for non-experts to interpret. To address this challenge, we propose a
novel pipeline that leverages Language Models, large and small, to compose
narratives for counterfactual explanations. We employ knowledge distillation
techniques along with a refining mechanism to enable Small Language Models to
perform comparably to their larger counterparts while maintaining robust
reasoning abilities. In addition, we introduce a simple but effective
evaluation method to assess natural language narratives, designed to verify
whether the models' responses are in line with the factual, counterfactual
ground truth. As a result, our proposed pipeline enhances both the reasoning
capabilities and practical performance of student models, making them more
suitable for real-world use cases.

Result: 在合成和真实语言建模任务中，VGB在多种指标上优于基线方法

Conclusion: VGB通过随机回溯机制有效缓解验证器错误放大问题，为过程引导的测试时采样提供了理论基础和实用算法

Abstract: Test-time algorithms that combine the generative power of language models
with process verifiers that assess the quality of partial generations offer a
promising lever for eliciting new reasoning capabilities, but the algorithmic
design space and computational scaling properties of such approaches are still
opaque, and their benefits are far from apparent when one accounts for the cost
of learning a high-quality verifier. Our starting point is the observation that
seemingly benign errors in a learned verifier can lead to catastrophic failures
for standard decoding techniques due to error amplification during the course
of generation. We then ask: can this be improved with more sophisticated
decoding strategies?
  We introduce a new process-guided test-time sampling algorithm, VGB, which
uses theoretically grounded backtracking to achieve provably better robustness
to verifier errors. VGB interprets autoregressive generation as a random walk
on a tree of partial generations, with transition probabilities guided by the
process verifier and base model; crucially, backtracking occurs
probabilistically. This process generalizes the seminal Sinclair-Jerrum random
walk (Sinclair & Jerrum, 1989) from the literature on approximate counting and
sampling in theoretical computer science, and a conceptual contribution of our
work is to highlight parallels with this literature. Empirically, we
demonstrate on both synthetic and real language modeling tasks that VGB
outperforms baselines on a variety of metrics.

Result: 理论推导了一维输入的测试误差及其最小化分割，多维输入的测试误差上界，并分析了专家参数学习的统计特性。实证验证了专家数量对近似误差与估计误差权衡的影响。

Conclusion: MoE学习中的近似误差与估计误差之间存在权衡关系，这种关系取决于专家数量，为理解专家混合模型的性能提供了理论依据。

Abstract: This paper uses classical high-rate quantization theory to provide new
insights into mixture-of-experts (MoE) models for regression tasks. Our MoE is
defined by a segmentation of the input space to regions, each with a
single-parameter expert that acts as a constant predictor with zero-compute at
inference. Motivated by high-rate quantization theory assumptions, we assume
that the number of experts is sufficiently large to make their input-space
regions very small. This lets us to study the approximation error of our MoE
model class: (i) for one-dimensional inputs, we formulate the test error and
its minimizing segmentation and experts; (ii) for multidimensional inputs, we
formulate an upper bound for the test error and study its minimization.
Moreover, we consider the learning of the expert parameters from a training
dataset, given an input-space segmentation, and formulate their statistical
learning properties. This leads us to theoretically and empirically show how
the tradeoff between approximation and estimation errors in MoE learning
depends on the number of experts.

<details>

Motivation: 传统基于不确定性的主动学习方法在深度神经网络中效果不佳，因为DNN的不确定性通常未校准，这会影响获取函数的有效性，导致泛化性能差和校准误差高。

Conclusion: 通过主动学习校准误差，可以有效提升深度神经网络在主动学习中的性能，降低校准误差和泛化误差。

Abstract: We study the problem of actively learning a classifier with a low calibration
error. One of the most popular Acquisition Functions (AFs) in pool-based Active
Learning (AL) is querying by the model's uncertainty. However, we recognize
that an uncalibrated uncertainty model on the unlabeled pool may significantly
affect the AF effectiveness, leading to sub-optimal generalization and high
calibration error on unseen data. Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) make it even
worse as the model uncertainty from DNN is usually uncalibrated. Therefore, we
propose a new AF by estimating calibration errors and query samples with the
highest calibration error before leveraging DNN uncertainty. Specifically, we
utilize a kernel calibration error estimator under the covariate shift and
formally show that AL with this AF eventually leads to a bounded calibration
error on the unlabeled pool and unseen test data. Empirically, our proposed
method surpasses other AF baselines by having a lower calibration and
generalization error across pool-based AL settings.

Motivation: 学习率预热已成为深度学习中的普遍启发式方法，但其理论基础仍然薄弱，需要提供原理性解释。

Method: 基于广义(L0,L1)-平滑条件，该条件将局部曲率建模为损失次优性的线性函数，并证明了该条件在常见神经网络架构中成立。在此假设下，分析了带预热策略的梯度下降收敛性。

Conclusion: 学习率预热策略在理论和实践上都具有优势，能加速训练收敛，特别是在语言和视觉模型中表现显著。

Abstract: Learning rate warm-up - increasing the learning rate at the beginning of
training - has become a ubiquitous heuristic in modern deep learning, yet its
theoretical foundations remain poorly understood. In this work, we provide a
principled explanation for why warm-up improves training. We rely on a
generalization of the $(L_0, L_1)$-smoothness condition, which bounds local
curvature as a linear function of the loss sub-optimality and exhibits
desirable closure properties. We demonstrate both theoretically and empirically
that this condition holds for common neural architectures trained with
mean-squared error and cross-entropy losses. Under this assumption, we prove
that Gradient Descent with a warm-up schedule achieves faster convergence than
with a fixed step-size, establishing upper and lower complexity bounds.
Finally, we validate our theoretical insights through experiments on language
and vision models, confirming the practical benefits of warm-up schedules.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决联邦学习在资源受限边缘设备上部署的挑战，包括内存、能源和通信带宽限制，以及传统同步和异步方法在异构大规模网络中因慢节点导致的延迟和收敛缓慢问题。

Method: 采用半异步联邦学习框架，使用稀疏参数更新和基于客户端更新年龄与方差的加权聚合机制。

Result: 在包含500个客户端和90%慢节点的实验中，FTTE比同步联邦学习（如FedAVG）收敛速度快81%，设备内存使用降低80%，通信负载减少69%，并且在挑战性场景下达到与半异步方法（如FedBuff）相当或更高的目标精度。

Conclusion: FTTE是首个适用于异构且主要资源受限边缘设备的实用且可扩展的联邦学习解决方案。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across
distributed devices while preserving data privacy, but deployment on
resource-constrained edge nodes remains challenging due to limited memory,
energy, and communication bandwidth. Traditional synchronous and asynchronous
FL approaches further suffer from straggler induced delays and slow convergence
in heterogeneous, large scale networks. We present FTTE (Federated Tiny
Training Engine),a novel semi-asynchronous FL framework that uniquely employs
sparse parameter updates and a staleness-weighted aggregation based on both age
and variance of client updates. Extensive experiments across diverse models and
data distributions - including up to 500 clients and 90% stragglers -
demonstrate that FTTE not only achieves 81% faster convergence, 80% lower
on-device memory usage, and 69% communication payload reduction than
synchronous FL (eg.FedAVG), but also consistently reaches comparable or higher
target accuracy than semi-asynchronous (eg.FedBuff) in challenging regimes.
These results establish FTTE as the first practical and scalable solution for
real-world FL deployments on heterogeneous and predominantly
resource-constrained edge devices.

Motivation: 解决非平稳强化学习中的分布漂移问题，传统QUCB算法在分布变化后可能利用次优奖励，需要开发能够检测并适应分布变化的算法。

Method: 提出DQUCB算法，使用转移密度函数检测分布漂移，利用似然值增强Q-learning UCB的不确定性估计质量，实现探索与利用的平衡。

Result: 理论上证明DQUCB比QUCB具有更好的遗憾保证；实验显示DQUCB在多个RL任务和COVID-19患者分配任务中计算高效且遗憾更低。

Conclusion: DQUCB算法能够有效检测和适应分布漂移，在非平稳强化学习环境中优于传统QUCB算法，具有更好的理论保证和实际性能。

Abstract: We study the Non-Stationary Reinforcement Learning (RL) under distribution
shifts in both finite-horizon episodic and infinite-horizon discounted Markov
Decision Processes (MDPs). In the finite-horizon case, the transition functions
may suddenly change at a particular episode. In the infinite-horizon setting,
such changes can occur at an arbitrary time step during the agent's interaction
with the environment. While the Q-learning Upper Confidence Bound algorithm
(QUCB) can discover a proper policy during learning, due to the distribution
shifts, this policy can exploit sub-optimal rewards after the shift happens. To
address this issue, we propose Density-QUCB (DQUCB), a shift-aware
Q-learning~UCB algorithm, which uses a transition density function to detect
distribution shifts, then leverages its likelihood to enhance the uncertainty
estimation quality of Q-learning~UCB, resulting in a balance between
exploration and exploitation. Theoretically, we prove that our oracle DQUCB
achieves a better regret guarantee than QUCB. Empirically, our DQUCB enjoys the
computational efficiency of model-free RL and outperforms QUCB baselines by
having a lower regret across RL tasks, as well as a real-world COVID-19 patient
hospital allocation task using a Deep-Q-learning architecture.

Abstract: Benchmarks for competition-style reasoning have advanced evaluation in
mathematics and programming, yet physics remains comparatively explored. Most
existing physics benchmarks evaluate only final answers, which fail to capture
reasoning processes, while recent stepwise methods rely on heuristic
LLM-as-judge scoring or restrictive linear assumptions, limiting reliability
and diagnostic validity. We introduce PRISM-Physics, a process-level evaluation
framework and benchmark for complex physics reasoning problems. Solutions are
represented as directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) of formulas, explicitly encoding
causal dependencies among intermediate steps to enable fine-grained,
interpretable, and theoretically grounded scoring. We prove the optimality of
the DAG representation and the corresponding scoring policy. Combining with a
fully rule-based method for symbolic formula equivalence matching that we
developed, we ensure consistent validation across diverse formulations without
heuristic judgments. Results show that our evaluation framework is more aligned
with human experts' scoring. Experiments on state-of-the-art LLMs reveal
persistent reasoning failures in physics, while step-level scoring offers both
diagnostic insight and rich signals for later training. By combining structural
rigor, theoretical guarantees, and symbolic validation, PRISM-Physics provides
a principled foundation for advancing process-level evaluation and guiding the
development of models with deeper scientific reasoning capabilities.

Conclusion: 叠加解缠对于映射度量揭示神经代码之间真实表示对齐是必要的，不同叠加排列会干扰对齐度量，导致对齐度被低估。

Abstract: The superposition hypothesis states that a single neuron within a population
may participate in the representation of multiple features in order for the
population to represent more features than the number of neurons. In
neuroscience and AI, representational alignment metrics measure the extent to
which different deep neural networks (DNNs) or brains represent similar
information. In this work, we explore a critical question: \textit{does
superposition interact with alignment metrics in any undesirable way?} We
hypothesize that models which represent the same features in \textit{different
superposition arrangements}, i.e., their neurons have different linear
combinations of the features, will interfere with predictive mapping metrics
(semi-matching, soft-matching, linear regression), producing lower alignment
than expected. We first develop a theory for how the strict permutation metrics
are dependent on superposition arrangements. This is tested by training sparse
autoencoders (SAEs) to disentangle superposition in toy models, where alignment
scores are shown to typically increase when a model's base neurons are replaced
with its sparse overcomplete latent codes. We find similar increases for
DNN\(\rightarrow\)DNN and DNN\(\rightarrow\)brain linear regression alignment
in the visual domain. Our results suggest that superposition disentanglement is
necessary for mapping metrics to uncover the true representational alignment
between neural codes.

Conclusion: 证明了基于可穿戴传感器的RPE估计的可行性，并确定了提高模型泛化能力的关键挑战。

Abstract: Accurate estimation of rating of perceived exertion (RPE) can enhance
resistance training through personalized feedback and injury prevention. This
study investigates the application of machine learning models to estimate RPE
during single-arm dumbbell bicep curls, using data from wearable inertial and
electromyography (EMG) sensors. A custom dataset of 69 sets and over 1000
repetitions was collected, with statistical features extracted for model
training. Among the models evaluated, a random forest classifier achieved the
highest performance, with 41.4% exact accuracy and 85.9% $\pm1$ RPE accuracy.
While the inclusion of EMG data slightly improved model accuracy over inertial
sensors alone, its utility may have been limited by factors such as data
quality and placement sensitivity. Feature analysis highlighted eccentric
repetition time as the strongest RPE predictor. The results demonstrate the
feasibility of wearable-sensor-based RPE estimation and identify key challenges
for improving model generalizability.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的LLM推理策略Best-of-Majority(BoM)，结合了多数投票和Best-of-N的优势，在Pass@k设置下实现了最优的推理扩展性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的LLM推理策略如多数投票和Best-of-N在困难任务中表现不佳，特别是在Pass@k评估设置下，它们无法随着采样预算N和提交次数k的增加而有效扩展性能。

Method: 提出Best-of-Majority(BoM)策略，关键步骤是在选择top-k奖励之前，将候选响应限制在N个样本中出现频率高的响应中。

Result: 理论证明当采样预算N=Ω̃(C*)时，BoM的遗憾为O(ε_opt+√(ε_RM²C*/k))，并建立了匹配的下界，证明算法是最小极大最优的。实验结果显示BoM在数学问题推理中优于多数投票和BoN。

Conclusion: BoM策略在Pass@k推理设置中实现了最优的扩展性能，其性能不会随着N的增加而下降，为LLM推理提供了更有效的策略。

Abstract: LLM inference often generates a batch of candidates for a prompt and selects
one via strategies like majority voting or Best-of- N (BoN). For difficult
tasks, this single-shot selection often underperforms. Consequently,
evaluations commonly report Pass@$k$: the agent may submit up to $k$ responses,
and only the best of them is used when computing regret. Motivated by this, we
study inference scaling in the more general Pass@$k$ inference setting, and
prove that neither majority voting nor BoN exhibits the desirable scaling with
$k$ and the sampling budget $N$. Combining the advantages of majority voting
and BoN, we propose a new inference strategy called Best-of-Majority (BoM),
with a pivotal step that restricts the candidates to the responses with high
frequency in the $N$ samples before selecting the top-$k$ rewards. We prove
that when the sampling budget is $N=\tilde\Omega(C^*)$, the regret of BoM is
$O(\epsilon_{\mathrm{opt}}+\sqrt{\epsilon_{\mathrm{RM}}^2C^*/k})$, where $C^*$
is the coverage coefficient, $\epsilon_{\mathrm{RM}}$ is the estimation error
of the reward model, and $\epsilon_{\mathrm{opt}}$ is the estimation error of
reward at the optimal response. We further establish a matching lower bound,
certifying that our algorithm is minimax optimal. Beyond optimality, BoM has a
key advantage: unlike majority voting and BoN, its performance does not degrade
when increasing $N$. Experimental results of inference on math problems show
BoM outperforming both majority voting and BoN.

Abstract: Partial observability is a notorious challenge in reinforcement learning
(RL), due to the need to learn complex, history-dependent policies. Recent
empirical successes have used privileged expert distillation--which leverages
availability of latent state information during training (e.g., from a
simulator) to learn and imitate the optimal latent, Markovian policy--to
disentangle the task of "learning to see" from "learning to act". While expert
distillation is more computationally efficient than RL without latent state
information, it also has well-documented failure modes. In this paper--through
a simple but instructive theoretical model called the perturbed Block MDP, and
controlled experiments on challenging simulated locomotion tasks--we
investigate the algorithmic trade-off between privileged expert distillation
and standard RL without privileged information. Our main findings are: (1) The
trade-off empirically hinges on the stochasticity of the latent dynamics, as
theoretically predicted by contrasting approximate decodability with belief
contraction in the perturbed Block MDP; and (2) The optimal latent policy is
not always the best latent policy to distill. Our results suggest new
guidelines for effectively exploiting privileged information, potentially
advancing the efficiency of policy learning across many practical partially
observable domains.

TL;DR: 本文提出了低概率正则化(Lp-Reg)方法来解决RLVR训练中的探索瓶颈问题，通过保护有价值的低概率探索性token来维持模型在复杂推理任务中的持续探索能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RLVR方法在训练过程中存在性能瓶颈，当策略熵崩溃时探索能力下降。研究发现过度关注熵会导致无关token被放大，同时有价值的低概率探索token（推理火花）被系统性地消除。

Method: 提出Lp-Reg方法，通过构建启发式代理分布来正则化策略。该代理分布通过过滤噪声token并对剩余候选重新归一化来放大推理火花的概率，然后作为软正则化目标通过KL散度保护这些有价值的token。

Result: Lp-Reg能够在约1000步内实现稳定的在线训练，而基线熵控制方法在此阶段会崩溃。在五个数学基准测试上达到60.17%的平均准确率，比先前方法提升2.66%。

Conclusion: Lp-Reg通过保护推理火花实现了持续有效的探索，解决了RLVR训练中的探索瓶颈问题，显著提升了复杂推理任务的性能。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has propelled Large
Language Models in complex reasoning, yet its scalability is often hindered by
a training bottleneck where performance plateaus as policy entropy collapses,
signaling a loss of exploration. Previous methods typically address this by
maintaining high policy entropy, yet the precise mechanisms that govern
meaningful exploration have remained underexplored. Our analysis suggests that
an unselective focus on entropy risks amplifying irrelevant tokens and
destabilizing training. This paper investigates the exploration dynamics within
RLVR and identifies a key issue: the gradual elimination of valuable
low-probability exploratory tokens, which we term \textbf{\textit{reasoning
sparks}}. We find that while abundant in pre-trained models, these sparks are
systematically extinguished during RLVR due to over-penalization, leading to a
degeneracy in exploration. To address this, we introduce Low-probability
Regularization (Lp-Reg). Its core mechanism regularizes the policy towards a
heuristic proxy distribution. This proxy is constructed by filtering out
presumed noise tokens and re-normalizing the distribution over the remaining
candidates. The result is a less-noisy proxy where the probability of
\textit{reasoning sparks} is amplified, which then serves as a soft
regularization target to shield these valuable tokens from elimination via KL
divergence. Experiments show that Lp-Reg enables stable on-policy training for
around 1,000 steps, a regime where baseline entropy-control methods collapse.
This sustained exploration leads to state-of-the-art performance, achieving a
$60.17\%$ average accuracy on five math benchmarks, an improvement of $2.66\%$
over prior methods. Code is available at https://github.com/CarlanLark/Lp-Reg.

### [98] [HALO: Memory-Centric Heterogeneous Accelerator with 2.5D Integration for Low-Batch LLM Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02675)
*Shubham Negi,Kaushik Roy*

Main category: cs.AR

TL;DR: HALO是一种异构内存中心加速器，专为低批量LLM推理中的预填充和解码阶段设计，通过集成HBM基DRAM内计算和片上模拟内存内计算，在LLaMA-2 7B和Qwen3 8B模型上实现最高18倍加速。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM推理包含计算需求不同的预填充和解码阶段，现有工作主要针对高批量推理或短上下文，而交互式应用所需的低批量和长上下文场景研究不足。

Method: HALO通过2.5D集成将HBM基DRAM内计算与片上模拟内存内计算结合，采用阶段感知映射策略：预填充阶段的计算密集型操作映射到CiM，解码阶段的内存密集型操作映射到CiD。

Result: 在LLaMA-2 7B和Qwen3 8B模型上，HALO相比注意力优化映射AttAcc实现最高18倍几何平均加速，相比全CiD映射CENT实现2.5倍加速。

Conclusion: 异构设计HALO能有效应对LLM推理中预填充和解码阶段的多样化计算和内存需求，在低批量长上下文场景下显著提升性能。

Abstract: The rapid adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) has driven a growing
demand for efficient inference, particularly in latency-sensitive applications
such as chatbots and personalized assistants. Unlike traditional deep neural
networks, LLM inference proceeds in two distinct phases: the prefill phase,
which processes the full input sequence in parallel, and the decode phase,
which generates tokens sequentially. These phases exhibit highly diverse
compute and memory requirements, which makes accelerator design particularly
challenging. Prior works have primarily been optimized for high-batch inference
or evaluated only short input context lengths, leaving the low-batch and long
context regime, which is critical for interactive applications, largely
underexplored.
  We propose HALO, a heterogeneous memory centric accelerator designed for
these unique challenges of prefill and decode phases in low-batch LLM
inference. HALO integrates HBM based Compute-in-DRAM (CiD) with an on-chip
analog Compute-in-Memory (CiM), co-packaged using 2.5D integration. To further
improve the hardware utilization, we introduce a phase-aware mapping strategy
that adapts to the distinct demands of the prefill and decode phases. Compute
bound operations in the prefill phase are mapped to CiM to exploit its high
throughput matrix multiplication capability, while memory-bound operations in
the decode phase are executed on CiD to benefit from reduced data movement
within DRAM. Additionally, we present an analysis of the performance tradeoffs
of LLMs under two architectural extremes: a fully CiD and a fully on-chip
analog CiM design to highlight the need for a heterogeneous design. We evaluate
HALO on LLaMA-2 7B and Qwen3 8B models. Our experimental results show that LLMs
mapped to HALO achieve up to 18x geometric mean speedup over AttAcc, an
attention-optimized mapping and 2.5x over CENT, a fully CiD based mapping.

TL;DR: 本文探讨了在凸优化中使用扩展浮点精度来加速大规模Max-Cut问题的求解，特别是在使用共轭梯度等间接矩阵求逆方法时。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Max-Cut问题已成为评估量子与经典优化器局部搜索启发式算法的基准。与仅提供平均性能保证的局部搜索不同，Goemans和Williamson的凸半定松弛方法提供最坏情况保证，适合构建基准和性能关键应用。

Method: 在凸优化中引入扩展浮点精度，特别是在内点法中使用共轭梯度等间接矩阵求逆方法。这些方法比直接方法复杂度更低，适用于超大规模问题。

Result: 使用扩展精度可减少求解时间，且加速因子随系统规模增大而增加。当使用共轭梯度等间接矩阵求逆方法时，增加内部工作精度能显著提升性能。

Conclusion: 扩展浮点精度在凸优化代数子程序中的应用，特别是在大规模问题中使用间接矩阵求逆方法时，能够有效加速求解过程，且加速效果随问题规模增大而增强。

Abstract: The combinatorial problem Max-Cut has become a benchmark in the evaluation of
local search heuristics for both quantum and classical optimisers. In contrast
to local search, which only provides average-case performance guarantees, the
convex semidefinite relaxation of Max-Cut by Goemans and Williamson, provides
worst-case guarantees and is therefore suited to both the construction of
benchmarks and in applications to performance-critic scenarios.
  We show how extended floating point precision can be incorporated in
algebraic subroutines in convex optimisation, namely in indirect matrix
inversion methods like Conjugate Gradient, which are used in Interior Point
Methods in the case of very large problem sizes. Also, an estimate is provided
of the expected acceleration of the time to solution for a hardware
architecture that runs natively on extended precision. Specifically, when using
indirect matrix inversion methods like Conjugate Gradient, which have lower
complexity than direct methods and are therefore used in very large problems,
we see that increasing the internal working precision reduces the time to
solution by a factor that increases with the system size.

Abstract: The increasing demand for real-time, low-latency artificial intelligence
applications has propelled the use of Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs)
for Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) implementations. FPGAs offer
reconfigurability, energy efficiency, and performance advantages over GPUs,
making them suitable for edge devices and embedded systems. This work presents
a novel library of resource-efficient convolution IPs designed to automatically
adapt to the available FPGA resources. Developed in VHDL, these IPs are
parameterizable and utilize fixed-point arithmetic for optimal performance.
Four IPs are introduced, each tailored to specific resource constraints,
offering flexibility in DSP usage, logic consumption, and precision.
Experimental results on a Zynq UltraScale+ FPGA highlight the trade-offs
between performance and resource usage. The comparison with recent FPGA-based
CNN acceleration techniques emphasizes the versatility and independence of this
approach from specific FPGA architectures or technological advancements. Future
work will expand the library to include pooling and activation functions,
enabling broader applicability and integration into CNN frameworks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DNA作为数字信息存储介质具有超高密度和耐久性优势，但实际部署面临合成成本、测序错误和生物约束（GC含量不平衡、同聚物）等挑战。

Method: 整合生物约束与深度学习，将二进制数据流编码为符号DNA序列，在包含替换、插入和删除的噪声信道中传输，并使用深度学习进行高保真重建。

Conclusion: 通过将理论、工作流和仿真统一到一个管道中，NeuroDNAAI实现了可扩展且生物学有效的档案DNA存储。

Abstract: DNA is a promising medium for digital information storage for its exceptional
density and durability. While prior studies advanced coding theory, workflow
design, and simulation tools, challenges such as synthesis costs, sequencing
errors, and biological constraints (GC-content imbalance, homopolymers) limit
practical deployment. To address this, our framework draws from quantum
parallelism concepts to enhance encoding diversity and resilience, integrating
biologically informed constraints with deep learning to enhance error
mitigation in DNA storage. NeuroDNAAI encodes binary data streams into symbolic
DNA sequences, transmits them through a noisy channel with substitutions,
insertions, and deletions, and reconstructs them with high fidelity. Our
results show that traditional prompting or rule-based schemes fail to adapt
effectively to realistic noise, whereas NeuroDNAAI achieves superior accuracy.
Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate low bit error rates for both text
and images. By unifying theory, workflow, and simulation into one pipeline,
NeuroDNAAI enables scalable, biologically valid archival DNA storage
