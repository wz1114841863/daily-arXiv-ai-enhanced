This work integrates active learning\nwith an existing unsupervised anomaly detection method by selectively querying\nthe labels of multivariate time series, which are then used to refine the\nthreshold selection process. To achieve this, we introduce a novel query\nstrategy called the dissimilarity-based query strategy (DQS).

To capture this phenomenon, we consider the collection of data\npoints whose gradients approximate a target gradient within tolerance\n$\\epsilon$ -- which we call an $\\epsilon$-forging set -- and develop a\nframework for its analysis. For linear regression and one-layer neural\nnetworks, we show that the Lebesgue measure of this set is small.

The Lung\nCT Screening Reporting and Data System (Lung-RADS) has been widely used as the\nstandard framework for patient management and follow-up. Nevertheless,\nLung-RADS faces trade-offs between sensitivity and specificity, as it\nstratifies risk solely based on lung nodule characteristics without\nincorporating various risk factors. Here we propose a reasoning language model\n(RLM) to integrate radiology findings with longitudinal medical records for\nindividualized lung cancer risk assessment. Through a systematic study\nincluding dataset construction and distillation, supervised fine-tuning,\nreinforcement learning, and comprehensive evaluation, our model makes\nsignificant improvements in risk prediction performance on datasets in the\nnational lung screening trial. Notably, RLM can decompose the risk evaluation\ntask into sub-components, analyze the contributions of diverse risk factors,\nand synthesize them into a final risk score computed using our data-driven\nsystem equation. Our approach improves both predictive accuracy and\nmonitorability through the chain of thought reasoning process, thereby\nfacilitating clinical translation into lung cancer screening."}

Recent anomaly assumption (AA) approaches alleviate\nthe lack of anomalies by injecting synthetic samples and training\ndiscriminative models. Despite promising results, these methods often suffer\nfrom two fundamental limitations: patchy generation, where scattered anomaly\nknowledge leads to overly simplistic or incoherent anomaly injection, and\nAnomaly Shift, where synthetic anomalies either resemble normal data too\nclosely or diverge unrealistically from real anomalies, thereby distorting\nclassification boundaries. In this paper, we propose CAPMix, a controllable\nanomaly augmentation framework that addresses both issues. First, we design a\nCutAddPaste mechanism to inject diverse and complex anomalies in a targeted\nmanner, avoiding patchy generation. Second, we introduce a label revision\nstrategy to adaptively refine anomaly labels, reducing the risk of anomaly\nshift. Finally, we employ dual-space mixup within a temporal convolutional\nnetwork to enforce smoother and more robust decision boundaries.

To explain the mechanism by which this is achieved, we reframe\nthe problem as that of learning a particular $3$-tensor, which we show is\ntypically of low rank. A key insight is that low-rank implementations of this\ntensor can be obtained by decomposing it along triplets of basic self-conjugate\nrepresentations of the group and leveraging the fusion structure to rule out\nmany components. Focusing on a phenomenologically similar but more tractable\nsurrogate model, we show that the network is able to find such low-rank\nimplementations (or approximations thereof), thereby using limited width to\napproximate the word-tensor in a generalizable way. In the case of the simple\nmultiplication word, we further elucidate the form of these low-rank\nimplementations, showing that the network effectively implements efficient\nmatrix multiplication in the sense of Strassen. Our work also sheds light on\nthe mechanism by which a network reaches such a solution under gradient\ndescent."}

The occasional volatility in their behavior, such as the propensity\nof transformer models to hallucinate, impedes trust and adoption of emerging AI\nsolutions in high-stakes areas. In the present work, we establish how and when\nhallucinations arise in pre-trained transformer models through concept\nrepresentations captured by sparse autoencoders, under scenarios with\nexperimentally controlled uncertainty in the input space. Our systematic\nexperiments reveal that the number of semantic concepts used by the transformer\nmodel grows as the input information becomes increasingly unstructured. In the\nface of growing uncertainty in the input space, the transformer model becomes\nprone to activate coherent yet input-insensitive semantic features, leading to\nhallucinated output. At its extreme, for pure-noise inputs, we identify a wide\nvariety of robustly triggered and meaningful concepts in the intermediate\nactivations of pre-trained transformer models, whose functional integrity we\nconfirm through targeted steering. We also show that hallucinations in the\noutput of a transformer model can be reliably predicted from the concept\npatterns embedded in transformer layer activations. This collection of insights\non transformer internal processing mechanics has immediate consequences for\naligning AI models with human values, AI safety, opening the attack surface for\npotential adversarial attacks, and providing a basis for automatic\nquantification of a model's hallucination risk."}

Outcome-based RL,\nwhich rewards policies solely for the correctness of the final answer, yields\nsubstantial accuracy gains but also induces a systematic loss in generation\ndiversity. This collapse undermines real-world performance, where diversity is\ncritical for test-time scaling. We analyze this phenomenon by viewing RL\npost-training as a sampling process and show that, strikingly, RL can reduce\neffective diversity even on the training set relative to the base model. Our\nstudy highlights two central findings: (i) a transfer of diversity degradation,\nwhere reduced diversity on solved problems propagates to unsolved ones, and\n(ii) the tractability of the outcome space, since reasoning tasks admit only a\nlimited set of distinct answers. Motivated by these insights, we propose\noutcome-based exploration, which assigns exploration bonuses according to final\noutcomes. We introduce two complementary algorithms: historical exploration,\nwhich encourages rarely observed answers via UCB-style bonuses, and batch\nexploration, which penalizes within-batch repetition to promote test-time\ndiversity. Experiments on standard competition math with Llama and Qwen models\ndemonstrate that both methods improve accuracy while mitigating diversity\ncollapse. On the theoretical side, we formalize the benefit of outcome-based\nexploration through a new model of outcome-based bandits. Together, these\ncontributions chart a practical path toward RL methods that enhance reasoning\nwithout sacrificing the diversity essential for scalable deployment."}

Quantized models address memory constraints in LLMs and\nenhance GPU resource utilization through efficient GPU sharing. However,\nquantized models have smaller KV block sizes than non-quantized models, causing\nlimited memory efficiency due to memory fragmentation. Also, distinct resource\nusage patterns between quantized and non-quantized models require efficient\nscheduling to maximize throughput. To address these challenges, we propose\nFineServe, an inference serving framework for mixed-precision LLMs. FineServe's\nkey contributions include: (1) KV Slab, a precision-aware adaptive memory\nmanagement technique dynamically allocating KV cache based on model\nquantization characteristics, significantly reducing GPU memory fragmentation,\nand (2) a two-level scheduling framework comprising a global scheduler that\nplaces models to GPUs based on request rates, latency SLOs, and memory\nconstraints and efficiency, and a local scheduler that adaptively adjusts batch\nsizes according to real-time request fluctuations. Experimental results\ndemonstrate that FineServe achieves up to 2.2x higher SLO attainment and 1.8x\nhigher token generation throughput compared to the state-of-the-art GPU sharing\nsystems."}
