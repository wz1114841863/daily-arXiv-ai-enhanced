### [1] [ENLighten: Lighten the Transformer, Enable Efficient Optical Acceleration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01673)
*Hanqing Zhu,Zhican Zhou,Shupeng Ning,Xuhao Wu,Ray Chen,Yating Wan,David Pan*

Main category: cs.ET

TL;DR: 提出了Lighten和ENLighten的光电协同设计框架，通过权重分解和可重构光子加速器解决Transformer模型在光子计算中的瓶颈，在ImageNet上实现50%剪枝和2.5倍能效提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决光子计算在大型Transformer模型中的两个瓶颈：(1)光电转换和数据移动带来的能效损失；(2)有限光子资源与Transformer规模不匹配导致的吞吐量稀释问题。

Method: 硬件-软件协同设计：Lighten进行PTC感知的压缩，将权重矩阵分解为低秩和结构化稀疏组件；ENLighten是可重构光子加速器，支持动态自适应张量核心和细粒度稀疏性。

Result: 在ImageNet上，Lighten对Base级Vision Transformer实现50%剪枝，精度损失仅约1%，仅需3个epoch（约1小时）微调；在ENLighten上部署，相比最先进的光子Transformer加速器实现2.5倍能效延迟乘积提升。

Conclusion: 该协同设计框架有效解决了光子计算在Transformer加速中的关键瓶颈，通过压缩和硬件优化实现了显著的能效提升，为大规模AI模型的光子加速提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Photonic computing has emerged as a promising substrate for accelerating the
dense linear-algebra operations at the heart of AI, yet adoption for large
Transformer models remains in its infancy. We identify two bottlenecks: (1)
costly electro--optic conversions and data-movement overheads that erode energy
efficiency as model sizes scale; (2) a mismatch between limited on-chip
photonic resources and Transformer scale, which forces frequent reuse of
photonic tensor cores and dilutes throughput gains. To address these
challenges, we introduce a hardware--software co-design framework. First, we
propose \texttt{Lighten}, a PTC-aware compression flow that post-hoc decomposes
each Transformer weight matrix into a low-rank component plus a
structured-sparse component aligned to photonic tensor-core granularity,
without lengthy retraining. Second, we present \texttt{ENLighten}, a
reconfigurable photonic accelerator with dynamically adaptive tensor cores,
driven by broadband light redistribution, enabling fine-grained sparsity
support and full power gating of inactive parts. On ImageNet, \texttt{Lighten}
prunes a Base-scale Vision Transformer by 50\% with $\approx$1\% accuracy drop
after only 3 epochs (about 1 hour) of fine-tuning. Deployed on
\texttt{ENLighten}, it achieves a $2.5\times$ improvement in energy--delay
product over the state-of-the-art photonic Transformer accelerator.

### [2] [Edge GPU Aware Multiple AI Model Pipeline for Accelerated MRI Reconstruction and Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01730)
*Ashiyana Abdul Majeed,Mahmoud Meribout,Safa Mohammed Sali*

Main category: cs.AR

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种硬件加速的多模型系统，用于从CT图像同时进行MRI重建和诊断，通过优化硬件引擎分配和模型微调，在NVIDIA边缘GPU上实现了近150帧/秒的实时性能，且准确率提升5%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI在医学影像处理中取得了显著进展，但很少有人研究具有硬件加速的多模型系统优化。随着专用边缘设备的出现，有效利用其加速器变得至关重要。

Method: 利用现代NVIDIA边缘GPU中的硬件引擎（GPU和DLA）和调度技术，优化多个AI模型不同层的硬件分配，减少硬件引擎间的理想时间。对GAN模型进行微调，避免回退到GPU引擎执行，同时不损失准确性。

Result: 在NVIDIA Jetson AGX Xavier和Orin设备上实现了近150帧/秒的实时性能，微调后的边缘GPU感知AI模型准确率提升了5%，两个微调模型的硬件分配使性能比原始模型翻倍。

Conclusion: 结果证明了在医学图像分析和诊断中采用硬件感知并行模型的有效性。

Abstract: Advancements in AI have greatly enhanced the medical imaging process, making
it quicker to diagnose patients. However, very few have investigated the
optimization of a multi-model system with hardware acceleration. As specialized
edge devices emerge, the efficient use of their accelerators is becoming
increasingly crucial. This paper proposes a hardware-accelerated method for
simultaneous reconstruction and diagnosis of \ac{MRI} from \ac{CT} images.
Real-time performance of achieving a throughput of nearly 150 frames per second
was achieved by leveraging hardware engines available in modern NVIDIA edge
GPU, along with scheduling techniques. This includes the GPU and the \ac{DLA}
available in both Jetson AGX Xavier and Jetson AGX Orin, which were considered
in this paper. The hardware allocation of different layers of the multiple AI
models was done in such a way that the ideal time between the hardware engines
is reduced. In addition, the AI models corresponding to the \ac{GAN} model were
fine-tuned in such a way that no fallback execution into the GPU engine is
required without compromising accuracy. Indeed, the accuracy corresponding to
the fine-tuned edge GPU-aware AI models exhibited an accuracy enhancement of
5\%. A further hardware allocation of two fine-tuned GPU-aware GAN models
proves they can double the performance over the original model, leveraging
adequate partitioning on the NVIDIA Jetson AGX Xavier and Orin devices. The
results prove the effectiveness of employing hardware-aware models in parallel
for medical image analysis and diagnosis.

### [3] [Multiplier-free In-Memory Vector-Matrix Multiplication Using Distributed Arithmetic](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02099)
*Felix Zeller,John Reuben,Dietmar Fey*

Main category: cs.AR

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于分布式算法(DA)的ReRAM内存计算方法，用于向量矩阵乘法(VMM)，通过移位相加电路替代传统ADC/DAC，显著降低了功耗和延迟。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统内存计算中的VMM操作需要大量数据移动，且ADC/DAC消耗大量功耗和面积，需要更高效的实现方法。

Method: 扩展分布式算法(DA)技术，在ReRAM内存中存储权重和，使用移位相加电路实现VMM，避免使用硬件乘法器。

Result: 通过晶体管级仿真验证，相比传统位切片方法，延迟降低4.5倍，能耗降低12倍，完全消除了功耗大的ADC需求。

Conclusion: 基于DA的内存计算方法在VMM操作中具有显著优势，为神经网络推理提供了更高效的硬件实现方案。

Abstract: Vector-Matrix Multiplication (VMM) is the fundamental and frequently required
computation in inference of Neural Networks (NN). Due to the large data
movement required during inference, VMM can benefit greatly from in-memory
computing. However, ADC/DACs required for in-memory VMM consume significant
power and area. `Distributed Arithmetic (DA)', a technique in computer
architecture prevalent in 1980s was used to achieve inner product or dot
product of two vectors without using a hard-wired multiplier when one of the
vectors is a constant. In this work, we extend the DA technique to multiply an
input vector with a constant matrix. By storing the sum of the weights in
memory, DA achieves VMM using shift-and-add circuits in the periphery of ReRAM
memory. We verify functional and also estimate non-functional properties
(latency, energy, area) by performing transistor-level simulations. Using
energy-efficient sensing and fine grained pipelining, our approach achieves 4.5
x less latency and 12 x less energy than VMM performed in memory conventionally
by bit slicing. Furthermore, DA completely eliminated the need for power-hungry
ADCs which are the main source of area and energy consumption in the current
VMM implementations in memory.

### [4] [Odontoceti: Ultra-Fast DAG Consensus with Two Round Commitment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01216)
*Preston Vander Vos*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: Odontoceti是一种基于DAG的共识协议，通过将故障容忍度从33%降低到20%，实现了仅需两轮通信的快速确认，在现实网络条件下达到300毫秒中位延迟和10,000 TPS的高吞吐量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决区块链用户对可扩展性的需求，期望快速确认和即时交易处理，通过降低故障容忍度来换取更低的延迟和更高的吞吐量。

Method: 采用n=5f+1验证者架构，构建无认证DAG并使用新颖的决策规则来提交区块，包含优化机制在参与者响应缓慢时推进进度，特别针对实践中更常见的崩溃故障场景。

Result: 在现实网络条件下实现300毫秒中位延迟和10,000 TPS吞吐量，相比现有生产协议延迟改善20-25%，验证了将通信轮数从三轮减少到两轮带来的显著性能提升。

Conclusion: 证明了较低故障容忍度共识协议在区块链中的实际可行性，为追求更高性能的区块链系统提供了新的设计方向。

Abstract: Users of blockchains value scalability, expecting fast confirmations and
immediate transaction processing. Odontoceti, the latest in DAG-based
consensus, addresses these concerns by prioritizing low latency and high
throughput, making a strategic trade-off in security by operating with a 20%
fault tolerance instead of the established 33% level. It is the first DAG-based
protocol to achieve commitment in just two communication rounds, delivering
median latency of 300 milliseconds while processing 10,000 transactions per
second under realistic network conditions. Odontoceti operates with n = 5f + 1
validators and creates an uncertified DAG with a novel decision rule for
committing blocks. The protocol includes an optimization that advances progress
when participants are slow, benefiting crash fault scenarios which are more
common in practice than Byzantine faults. Evaluation results demonstrate 20-25%
latency improvements compared to an existing production protocol, validating
that reducing wave length from three rounds to two rounds yields meaningful
performance benefits. This paper establishes the practical viability of lower
fault tolerance consensus protocols for blockchains.

### [5] [Kant: An Efficient Unified Scheduling System for Large-Scale AI Clusters](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01256)
*Lingling Zeng,Gen Zhang,Jialin Peng,Xiang Xu,Yuan Xu,Lijun Ma*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: Kant是一个高效统一的大规模AI容器集群调度平台，支持训练和推理任务的协同调度，通过Backfill和增强Binpack等策略显著提升资源利用率和调度效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI集群规模扩大和大语言模型训练推理需求快速增长，传统调度系统在资源利用、调度效率和服务质量平衡方面面临挑战。

Method: 基于Kant系统实际实现，定义了GPU分配率、调度占用率、GPU节点碎片率、作业等待时间分布和作业训练时间估计分布等关键评估指标，采用Backfill和增强Binpack等调度策略。

Result: 实验结果表明Kant在数百到数万GPU规模的集群中表现优异，显著提高资源利用率、减少资源碎片和分布式训练通信开销，已在多个AI数据中心集群稳定部署。

Conclusion: 这项工作为构建高性能、高可用的AI原生调度基础设施提供了实用的工程方法。

Abstract: As AI cluster sizes continue to expand and the demand for
large-language-model (LLM) training and inference workloads grows rapidly,
traditional scheduling systems face significant challenges in balancing
resource utilization, scheduling efficiency, and service quality. This paper
presents and evaluates Kant: an efficient unified scheduling platform designed
for large-scale AI container clusters, supporting the co-scheduling of both
training and inference jobs. Based on the practical implementation of the Kant
system, we systematically define a set of key evaluation metrics for AI
clusters, including GPU Allocation Ratio (GAR), Scheduling Occupancy Rate
(SOR), GPU Node Fragmentation Ratio (GFR), Job Waiting Time Distribution
(JWTD), and Job Training Time Estimation Distribution (JTTED), providing a
foundation for quantitative performance analysis. Experimental results
demonstrate that Kant achieves exceptional performance in clusters ranging from
hundreds to tens of thousands of GPUs. By leveraging scheduling strategies such
as Backfill and Enhanced Binpack (E-Binpack), the system significantly improves
resource utilization and scheduling efficiency, while effectively reducing
resource fragmentation and communication overhead in distributed training. The
system has been deployed in multiple AI data center clusters, where it stably
supports large-scale intelligent computing workloads. This work provides a
practical engineering approach for building high-performance, highly available,
AI-native scheduling infrastructure.

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: 提出了IoT-MCP框架，通过边缘部署的MCP服务器连接LLM与IoT设备，并创建了IoT-MCP Bench基准测试，在22种传感器和6种微控制器上实现了100%任务成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLM与IoT系统集成面临的硬件异构性和控制复杂性挑战，MCP协议成为关键推动因素。

Method: 实施MCP协议通过边缘部署服务器，构建IoT-MCP框架连接LLM与IoT生态系统。

Result: 实验验证显示100%任务成功率，平均响应时间205ms，峰值内存占用74KB。

Conclusion: 该工作提供了开源集成框架和标准化评估方法，推动LLM-IoT系统发展。

Abstract: The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) with Internet-of-Things (IoT)
systems faces significant challenges in hardware heterogeneity and control
complexity. The Model Context Protocol (MCP) emerges as a critical enabler,
providing standardized communication between LLMs and physical devices. We
propose IoT-MCP, a novel framework that implements MCP through edge-deployed
servers to bridge LLMs and IoT ecosystems. To support rigorous evaluation, we
introduce IoT-MCP Bench, the first benchmark containing 114 Basic Tasks (e.g.,
``What is the current temperature?'') and 1,140 Complex Tasks (e.g., ``I feel
so hot, do you have any ideas?'') for IoT-enabled LLMs. Experimental validation
across 22 sensor types and 6 microcontroller units demonstrates IoT-MCP's 100%
task success rate to generate tool calls that fully meet expectations and
obtain completely accurate results, 205ms average response time, and 74KB peak
memory footprint. This work delivers both an open-source integration framework
(https://github.com/Duke-CEI-Center/IoT-MCP-Servers) and a standardized
evaluation methodology for LLM-IoT systems.

### [7] [QScale: Probabilistic Chained Consensus for Moderate-Scale Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01536)
*Hasan Heydari,Alysson Bessani,Kartik Nayak*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: 提出了QScale协议，针对中等规模分布式账本系统（数百到数千个节点），实现了每个进程O(κ√n)的通信复杂度、总通信复杂度O(nκ)和O(κ)轮的最佳延迟。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有分布式账本协议要么通信复杂度高（如PBFT），只适合小规模系统；要么依赖委员会抽样方法（如Algorand），只适合大规模系统。两者都不适合中等规模（数百到一千个节点）的生产系统。

Method: 设计QScale协议，通过优化通信结构实现亚线性通信复杂度，确保安全性和活性，同时保持低延迟。

Result: QScale实现了每个进程O(κ√n)的预期通信复杂度，总通信复杂度O(nκ)，最佳情况延迟为O(κ)轮，安全性和活性概率极高。

Conclusion: QScale填补了中等规模分布式账本系统的空白，在通信复杂度和延迟方面实现了显著改进，适合实际生产环境使用。

Abstract: Existing distributed ledger protocols either incur a high communication
complexity and are thus suited to systems with a small number of processes
(e.g., PBFT), or rely on committee-sampling-based approaches that only work for
a very large number of processes (e.g., Algorand). Neither of these lines of
work is well-suited for moderate-scale distributed ledgers ranging from a few
hundred to a thousand processes, which are common in production (e.g, Redbelly,
Sui). The goal of this work is to design a distributed ledger with sub-linear
communication complexity per process, sub-quadratic total communication
complexity, and low latency for finalizing a block into the ledger, such that
it can be used for moderate-scale systems. We propose QScale, a protocol in
which every process incurs only $\widetilde{O}(\kappa \sqrt{n})$ communication
complexity per-block in expectation, $\widetilde{O}(n\kappa)$ total
communication complexity per-block in expectation, and a best-case latency of
$O(\kappa)$ rounds while ensuring safety and liveness with overwhelming
probability, with $\kappa$ being a small security parameter.

### [8] [Accuracy vs Performance: An abstraction model for deadline constrained offloading at the mobile-edge](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01885)
*Jamie Cotter,Ignacio Castineiras,Victor Cionca*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: 提出一种面向移动边缘设备的低延迟DNN卸载调度算法，通过轻量级网络状态表示、优先级感知抢占和任务截止时间管理来减少延迟。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决移动边缘设备上DNN任务卸载的低延迟需求，特别是在高负载情况下保证任务按时完成。

Method: 设计包含设备可用性、网络链路通信、优先级感知抢占和任务截止时间的调度算法，采用资源可用性表示、网络离散化和动态带宽估计机制。

Result: 在废物分类场景下，相比之前的方法表现更好，在高负载下具有更好的性能，动态带宽估计提高了资源稀缺时的任务吞吐量。

Conclusion: 所提出的低延迟抽象模型在高负载下表现优异，动态带宽估计机制有效提升了任务放置效率和系统吞吐量。

Abstract: In this paper, we present a solution for low-latency deadline-constrained DNN
offloading on mobile edge devices. We design a scheduling algorithm with
lightweight network state representation, considering device availability,
communication on the network link, priority-aware pre-emption, and task
deadlines. The scheduling algorithm aims to reduce latency by designing a
resource availability representation, as well as a network discretisation and a
dynamic bandwidth estimation mechanism. We implement the scheduling algorithm
into a system composed of four Raspberry Pi 2 (model Bs) mobile edge devices,
sampling a waste classification conveyor belt at a set frame rate. The system
is evaluated and compared to a previous approach of ours, which was proven to
outcompete work-stealers and a non-pre-emption based scheduling heuristic under
the aforementioned waste classification scenario. Our findings show the novel
lower latency abstraction models yield better performance under high-volume
workloads, with the dynamic bandwidth estimation assisting the task placement
while, ultimately, increasing task throughput in times of resource scarcity.

### [9] [Programming RISC-V accelerators via Fortran](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02170)
*Nick Brown,Jake Davies,Felix LeClair*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: 提出一种让Fortran科学计算代码能够在RISC-V加速器上运行的方法，避免代码重写。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RISC-V加速器有潜力用于高性能计算，但需要专门的编程模型，而科学计算代码多为复杂的Fortran代码，重写不现实。

Method: 开发了一种通过Fortran驱动RISC-V加速器架构的方法。

Result: 该方法能够避免代码重新开发。

Conclusion: 提出的方法为在RISC-V加速器上运行现有Fortran科学计算代码提供了可行途径。

Abstract: A range of RISC-V based accelerators are available and coming to market, and
there is strong potential for these to be used for High Performance Computing
(HPC) workloads. However, such accelerators tend to provide bespoke programming
models and APIs that require codes to be rewritten. In scientific computing,
where many of the simulation code are highly complex, extensive, and written in
Fortran, this is not realistic. In this extended abstract we present an
approach that enables driving such architectures via Fortran, avoiding code
redevelopment.

*Hung Le,Sherif Abbas,Minh Hoang Nguyen,Van Dai Do,Huu Hiep Nguyen,Dung Nguyen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 将分子动力学模拟重新定义为时间序列预测问题，使用位移预测而非绝对位置，结合物理约束的Morse势函数来增强预测的物理合理性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统密度泛函理论(DFT)方法计算成本高昂，限制了长期分子动力学模拟的可行性，需要开发更高效的替代方案。

Method: 将MD模拟作为时间序列预测问题，使用位移预测模型，结合基于DFT参数化的Morse对势函数的物理约束损失和推理机制。

Result: 在多种材料上持续超越标准基线方法的模拟精度，能够在几分钟内稳定模拟数千个MD步骤。

Conclusion: 物理知识的融入对于提高原子轨迹预测的可靠性和精度至关重要，该方法为昂贵的DFT模拟提供了可扩展的替代方案。

Abstract: Efficient molecular dynamics (MD) simulation is vital for understanding
atomic-scale processes in materials science and biophysics. Traditional density
functional theory (DFT) methods are computationally expensive, which limits the
feasibility of long-term simulations. We propose a novel approach that
formulates MD simulation as a time-series forecasting problem, enabling
advanced forecasting models to predict atomic trajectories via displacements
rather than absolute positions. We incorporate a physics-informed loss and
inference mechanism based on DFT-parametrised pair-wise Morse potential
functions that penalize unphysical atomic proximity to enforce physical
plausibility. Our method consistently surpasses standard baselines in
simulation accuracy across diverse materials. The results highlight the
importance of incorporating physics knowledge to enhance the reliability and
precision of atomic trajectory forecasting. Remarkably, it enables stable
modeling of thousands of MD steps in minutes, offering a scalable alternative
to costly DFT simulations.

### [11] [Control the Temperature: Selective Sampling for Diverse and High-Quality LLM Outputs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01218)
*Sergey Troshin,Wafaa Mohammed,Yan Meng,Christof Monz,Antske Fokkens,Vlad Niculae*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出选择性采样方法，在数学推理任务中动态切换贪婪采样和高温度采样，以平衡多样性和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统高温度采样在需要高精度的任务（如数学推理）中会降低推理质量，因为会在敏感解码位置采样错误续写。

Method: 训练轻量级分类器预测采样风险，基于风险指标动态选择贪婪采样或高温度采样，最小化延迟开销。

Result: 在数学推理任务上的实验表明，选择性采样在高温设置下改善了质量-多样性权衡。

Conclusion: 选择性采样能有效解决高温度采样在精确任务中的准确性问题，同时保持输出多样性。

Abstract: Diversity is an essential metric for evaluating the creativity of outputs
generated by language models. Temperature-based sampling is a common strategy
to increase diversity. However, for tasks that require high precision, e.g.,
mathematical reasoning, uncontrolled high temperature sampling, e.g., min-$p$
or top-$p$, degrades reasoning quality. We demonstrate that the loss of
accuracy is caused by sampling incorrect continuations in sensitive decoding
positions. To address this, in this paper, we propose \textbf{selective
sampling}, a method that dynamically switches between greedy and
high-temperature sampling based on a sampling risk metric. This risk metric
estimates the likelihood of output errors when applying high-temperature
sampling on the current token position. To predict sampling risk, we train a
lightweight classifier on a small subset of verifiable problems. The trained
classifier can be integrated with the base language model with minimal latency
overhead. Experiments on mathematical reasoning tasks demonstrate that
selective sampling enhances the quality-diversity trade-off, even in
high-temperature settings.

### [12] [Automated Extraction of Material Properties using LLM-based AI Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01235)
*Subham Ghosh,Abhishek Tewari*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 开发了一种基于大语言模型的自动化工作流，从约10,000篇科学文献中提取热电和结构性能数据，构建了目前最大的热电材料数据集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有材料数据库规模小、手动整理或偏向第一性原理计算，实验文献数据未被充分利用，限制了材料快速发现。

Method: 采用动态令牌分配、零样本多智能体提取和条件表解析的LLM驱动工作流，平衡准确性与计算成本。

Result: 从50篇基准论文测试中，GPT-4.1达到最高准确率（热电性能F1=0.91，结构字段F1=0.82），构建了27,822条温度分辨的性能记录数据集。

Conclusion: 该研究提供了最大的LLM整理热电数据集，建立了可扩展的数据驱动材料发现基础，并发布了交互式网络浏览器工具。

Abstract: The rapid discovery of materials is constrained by the lack of large,
machine-readable datasets that couple performance metrics with structural
context. Existing databases are either small, manually curated, or biased
toward first principles results, leaving experimental literature
underexploited. We present an agentic, large language model (LLM)-driven
workflow that autonomously extracts thermoelectric and structural-properties
from about 10,000 full-text scientific articles. The pipeline integrates
dynamic token allocation, zeroshot multi-agent extraction, and conditional
table parsing to balance accuracy against computational cost. Benchmarking on
50 curated papers shows that GPT-4.1 achieves the highest accuracy (F1 = 0.91
for thermoelectric properties and 0.82 for structural fields), while GPT-4.1
Mini delivers nearly comparable performance (F1 = 0.89 and 0.81) at a fraction
of the cost, enabling practical large scale deployment. Applying this workflow,
we curated 27,822 temperature resolved property records with normalized units,
spanning figure of merit (ZT), Seebeck coefficient, conductivity, resistivity,
power factor, and thermal conductivity, together with structural attributes
such as crystal class, space group, and doping strategy. Dataset analysis
reproduces known thermoelectric trends, such as the superior performance of
alloys over oxides and the advantage of p-type doping, while also surfacing
broader structure-property correlations. To facilitate community access, we
release an interactive web explorer with semantic filters, numeric queries, and
CSV export. This study delivers the largest LLM-curated thermoelectric dataset
to date, provides a reproducible and cost-profiled extraction pipeline, and
establishes a foundation for scalable, data-driven materials discovery beyond
thermoelectrics.

### [13] [RSAVQ: Riemannian Sensitivity-Aware Vector Quantization for Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01240)
*Zukang Xu,Xing Hu,Qiang Wu,Dawei Yang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RSAVQ是一个新颖的向量量化框架，通过几何驱动的方法改进大语言模型的极低位量化，解决了方向误差无约束和比特分配次优的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型参数量指数增长给资源受限设备部署带来挑战，现有向量量化方法存在方向误差无约束和比特分配次优两个关键问题。

Method: 提出两个几何驱动创新：1) 误差方向敏感度引导(EDSG)，利用Fisher信息矩阵诱导的黎曼度量将量化误差投影到参数空间低敏感方向；2) 权重通道敏感度引导(WCSG)，通过FIM曲率分析构建通道级敏感度度量来动态指导比特资源分配。

Result: 在LLaMA-3 8B的2位量化中，RSAVQ在困惑度上领先基线方法VPTQ和QuIP# 0.4，在零样本准确率上领先1.5。

Conclusion: 该工作为受限环境提供了实用解决方案，并在信息几何和神经网络量化之间建立了理论桥梁，推动了高效深度学习的发展。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across
a wide range of natural language processing tasks. However, their exponentially
increasing parameters pose significant challenges for deployment on
resource-constrained devices. Vector Quantization (VQ) shows great promise for
low-bit quantization (e.g., 2 to 4 bits), but existing work faces two key
challenges: unconstrained direction error and suboptimal bit allocation. In
this paper, we propose RSAVQ, a novel VQ framework to enhance extremely low-bit
quantization for LLMs. RSAVQ introduces two geometry-driven innovations that
effectively mitigate above limitations: (1) Error Direction Sensitivity
Guidance (EDSG), which leverages the Fisher Information Matrix (FIM)-induced
Riemannian metric to project quantization errors onto low-sensitivity
directions in the parameter space. Specifically, this projection is performed
along the negative natural gradient direction, which effectively suppresses
error expansion. (2) Weight Channel Sensitivity Guidance (WCSG) , which
constructs a channel-wise sensitivity metric via FIM curvature analysis to
dynamically guide bit resource allocation. The approach facilitates a globally
optimal quantization solution within prescribed bit constraints. Experiments
demonstrate that RSAVQ outperforms existing methods for LLMs. For example, in
2-bit quantization of LLaMA-3 8B, RSAVQ leads baselines like VPTQ and QuIP# by
0.4 in perplexity (PPL) and 1.5 in zero-shot accuracy. This work offers a
practical solution for constrained environments and a theoretical bridge
between information geometry and the quantization of neural networks, advancing
efficient deep learning.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于信任感知深度Q网络的联邦学习防御方法，通过整合多信号证据来更新客户端信任度，优化长期鲁棒性-准确率目标，有效应对部分可观测性下的投毒和后门攻击。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦学习在部分可观测环境下容易受到投毒和后门攻击，现有防御方法难以有效应对这种威胁。

Method: 将防御建模为部分可观测序列决策问题，引入信任感知深度Q网络，整合多信号证据进行客户端信任更新，优化长期鲁棒性-准确率目标。

Result: 在CIFAR-10上的实验表明：1）基准测试显示准确率稳步提升；2）Dirichlet扫描显示增加客户端重叠能持续提高准确率并降低ASR；3）信号预算研究显示准确率保持稳定而ASR增加、ROC-AUC下降；4）与随机、线性Q和策略梯度控制器相比，DQN实现了最佳的鲁棒性-准确率权衡。

Conclusion: 信任感知深度Q网络能够有效防御联邦学习中的投毒和后门攻击，通过序列信念更新缓解弱信号问题，实现最优的鲁棒性-准确率权衡。

Abstract: Federated learning is vulnerable to poisoning and backdoor attacks under
partial observability. We formulate defence as a partially observable
sequential decision problem and introduce a trust-aware Deep Q-Network that
integrates multi-signal evidence into client trust updates while optimizing a
long-horizon robustness--accuracy objective. On CIFAR-10, we (i) establish a
baseline showing steadily improving accuracy, (ii) show through a Dirichlet
sweep that increased client overlap consistently improves accuracy and reduces
ASR with stable detection, and (iii) demonstrate in a signal-budget study that
accuracy remains steady while ASR increases and ROC-AUC declines as
observability is reduced, which highlights that sequential belief updates
mitigate weaker signals. Finally, a comparison with random, linear-Q, and
policy gradient controllers confirms that DQN achieves the best
robustness--accuracy trade-off.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of train delays is critical for efficient railway
operations, enabling better scheduling and dispatching decisions. While earlier
approaches have largely focused on forecasting the exact delays of individual
trains, recent studies have begun exploring station-level delay prediction to
support higher-level traffic management. In this paper, we propose the
Railway-centric Spatio-Temporal Graph Convolutional Network (RSTGCN), designed
to forecast average arrival delays of all the incoming trains at railway
stations for a particular time period. Our approach incorporates several
architectural innovations and novel feature integrations, including train
frequency-aware spatial attention, which significantly enhances predictive
performance. To support this effort, we curate and release a comprehensive
dataset for the entire Indian Railway Network (IRN), spanning 4,735 stations
across 17 zones - the largest and most diverse railway network studied to date.
We conduct extensive experiments using multiple state-of-the-art baselines,
demonstrating consistent improvements across standard metrics. Our work not
only advances the modeling of average delay prediction in large-scale rail
networks but also provides an open dataset to encourage further research in
this critical domain.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TetriServe提出了一种针对Diffusion Transformer模型的动态并行服务系统，通过步级序列并行和轮次调度机制，在保证图像质量的同时显著提高了服务级别目标的达成率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的DiT服务系统使用固定程度的序列并行，在处理混合分辨率和截止时间的异构工作负载时效率低下，导致GPU利用率差和SLO达成率低。

Method: 提出步级序列并行策略，根据请求的截止时间动态调整并行度；设计TetriServe系统，采用轮次调度机制，包括时间离散化、步级并行度适配和请求联合打包。

Result: 在先进的DiT模型上评估显示，TetriServe相比现有解决方案实现了高达32%的SLO达成率提升，且不降低图像质量。

Conclusion: TetriServe通过动态并行调度策略有效解决了DiT模型服务中的计算效率问题，为高质量图像生成提供了高效的服务解决方案。

Abstract: Diffusion Transformer (DiT) models excel at generating highquality images
through iterative denoising steps, but serving them under strict Service Level
Objectives (SLOs) is challenging due to their high computational cost,
particularly at large resolutions. Existing serving systems use fixed degree
sequence parallelism, which is inefficient for heterogeneous workloads with
mixed resolutions and deadlines, leading to poor GPU utilization and low SLO
attainment.
  In this paper, we propose step-level sequence parallelism to dynamically
adjust the parallel degree of individual requests according to their deadlines.
We present TetriServe, a DiT serving system that implements this strategy for
highly efficient image generation. Specifically, TetriServe introduces a novel
round-based scheduling mechanism that improves SLO attainment: (1) discretizing
time into fixed rounds to make deadline-aware scheduling tractable, (2)
adapting parallelism at the step level and minimize GPU hour consumption, and
(3) jointly packing requests to minimize late completions. Extensive evaluation
on state-of-the-art DiT models shows that TetriServe achieves up to 32% higher
SLO attainment compared to existing solutions without degrading image quality.

### [17] [Budgeted Broadcast: An Activity-Dependent Pruning Rule for Neural Network Efficiency](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01263)
*Yaron Meirovitch,Fuming Yang,Jeff Lichtman,Nir Shavit*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出Budgeted Broadcast (BB)剪枝方法，基于局部流量预算（活动率与扇出的乘积）来剪枝，通过最大化编码熵实现选择性与受众平衡，在多种网络结构中提升准确率和表示多样性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统剪枝方法基于参数对损失的影响（如幅度或梯度）进行剪枝，本文提出基于局部流量预算的新方法，旨在提高编码熵和表示效率。

Method: BB方法为每个单元分配局部流量预算（活动率×扇出），通过约束熵分析得出选择性与受众平衡公式，使用简单的局部执行器剪枝扇入（降低活动）或扇出（减少广播）。

Result: 在ASR Transformer、人脸识别ResNet和突触预测3D U-Net上，BB在相同稀疏度下提高了编码熵、去相关性和准确率，有时甚至超过密集基线。在电子显微镜图像上达到最先进的F1和PR-AUC。

Conclusion: BB方法易于集成，为学习更多样化和高效的表示提供了一条路径，通过局部流量预算实现更好的剪枝效果。

Abstract: Most pruning methods remove parameters ranked by impact on loss (e.g.,
magnitude or gradient). We propose Budgeted Broadcast (BB), which gives each
unit a local traffic budget (the product of its long-term on-rate $a_i$ and
fan-out $k_i$). A constrained-entropy analysis shows that maximizing coding
entropy under a global traffic budget yields a selectivity-audience balance,
$\log\frac{1-a_i}{a_i}=\beta k_i$. BB enforces this balance with simple local
actuators that prune either fan-in (to lower activity) or fan-out (to reduce
broadcast). In practice, BB increases coding entropy and decorrelation and
improves accuracy at matched sparsity across Transformers for ASR, ResNets for
face identification, and 3D U-Nets for synapse prediction, sometimes exceeding
dense baselines. On electron microscopy images, it attains state-of-the-art F1
and PR-AUC under our evaluation protocol. BB is easy to integrate and suggests
a path toward learning more diverse and efficient representations.

Abstract: Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) is central to robotic systems
cooperating in dynamic environments. While prior work has focused on these
collaborative settings, adversarial interactions are equally critical for
real-world applications such as pursuit-evasion, security, and competitive

scalable training of adversarial policies in high-fidelity physics simulations.
We introduce a suite of adversarial MARL environments featuring heterogeneous
agents with asymmetric goals and capabilities. Our platform integrates a
competitive variant of Heterogeneous Agent Reinforcement Learning with Proximal
Policy Optimization (HAPPO), enabling efficient training and evaluation under
adversarial dynamics. Experiments across several benchmark scenarios

morphologically diverse multi-agent competition while maintaining high

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前主流的大模型训练范式只在最后阶段引入强化学习，作者质疑这是否是最优方式，希望将强化学习的探索精神更早引入预训练阶段。

Method: 提出RLP目标，将思维链视为探索动作，奖励基于思维链对预测未来token的信息增益计算，形成无验证器的密集奖励信号，可在普通文本上进行预训练。

Result: 在Qwen3-1.7B-Base上预训练RLP，在8个数学科学基准上平均提升19%；在Nemotron-Nano-12B-v2上应用RLP，整体平均从42.81%提升至61.32%，科学推理提升23%。

Conclusion: RLP成功将强化学习重新定义为预训练目标，弥合了下一词预测与有用思维链推理之间的差距，证明可在预训练阶段有效培养独立思考能力。

Abstract: The dominant paradigm for training large reasoning models starts with
pre-training using next-token prediction loss on vast amounts of data.
Reinforcement learning, while powerful in scaling reasoning, is introduced only
as the very last phase of post-training, preceded by supervised fine-tuning.
While dominant, is this an optimal way of training? In this paper, we present
RLP, an information-driven reinforcement pretraining objective, that brings the
core spirit of reinforcement learning -- exploration -- to the last phase of
pretraining. The key idea is to treat chain-of-thought as an exploratory
action, with rewards computed based on the information gain it provides for
predicting future tokens. This training objective essentially encourages the
model to think for itself before predicting what comes next, thus teaching an
independent thinking behavior earlier in the pretraining. More concretely, the
reward signal measures the increase in log-likelihood of the next token when
conditioning on both context and a sampled reasoning chain, compared to
conditioning on context alone. This approach yields a verifier-free dense
reward signal, allowing for efficient training for the full document stream
during pretraining. Specifically, RLP reframes reinforcement learning for
reasoning as a pretraining objective on ordinary text, bridging the gap between
next-token prediction and the emergence of useful chain-of-thought reasoning.
Pretraining with RLP on Qwen3-1.7B-Base lifts the overall average across an
eight-benchmark math-and-science suite by 19%. With identical post-training,
the gains compound, with the largest improvements on reasoning-heavy tasks such
as AIME25 and MMLU-Pro. Applying RLP to the hybrid Nemotron-Nano-12B-v2
increases the overall average from 42.81% to 61.32% and raises the average on
scientific reasoning by 23%, demonstrating scalability across architectures and
model sizes.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合LQR和强化学习的混合控制框架，用于结构振动控制，避免RL训练期间对结构的潜在损害。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于模型的LQR控制需要繁琐的系统辨识，而纯RL控制训练期间可能损害结构。研究发现即使基于错误模型的LQR控制器也比无控制效果好。

Method: 使用基于随机选择模型的LQR控制器来指导RL控制器训练，形成混合控制框架，保持模型无关性同时降低探索风险。

Result: 该混合方法消除了对显式系统模型的依赖，同时最小化了朴素RL实现中的探索风险。

Conclusion: 这是首个解决RL振动控制训练安全挑战并提供验证解决方案的研究，为模型无关的结构振动控制提供了安全有效的方法。

Abstract: Structural vibrations induced by external excitations pose significant risks,
including safety hazards for occupants, structural damage, and increased
maintenance costs. While conventional model-based control strategies, such as
Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR), effectively mitigate vibrations, their
reliance on accurate system models necessitates tedious system identification.
This tedious system identification process can be avoided by using a model-free
Reinforcement learning (RL) method. RL controllers derive their policies solely
from observed structural behaviour, eliminating the requirement for an explicit
structural model. For an RL controller to be truly model-free, its training
must occur on the actual physical system rather than in simulation. However,
during this training phase, the RL controller lacks prior knowledge and it
exerts control force on the structure randomly, which can potentially harm the
structure. To mitigate this risk, we propose guiding the RL controller using a
Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) controller. While LQR control typically relies
on an accurate structural model for optimal performance, our observations
indicate that even an LQR controller based on an entirely incorrect model
outperforms the uncontrolled scenario. Motivated by this finding, we introduce
a hybrid control framework that integrates both LQR and RL controllers. In this
approach, the LQR policy is derived from a randomly selected model and its
parameters. As this LQR policy does not require knowledge of the true or an
approximate structural model the overall framework remains model-free. This
hybrid approach eliminates dependency on explicit system models while
minimizing exploration risks inherent in naive RL implementations. As per our
knowledge, this is the first study to address the critical training safety
challenge of RL-based vibration control and provide a validated solution.

Motivation: 理解RNN的内部动态对于提高其可解释性和改进设计至关重要，但目前缺乏有效的方法来识别信息传递的关键节点。

Method: 使用信息论方法量化节点间互信息，识别信息中继节点，并在合成和真实时间序列分类任务中应用，包括LSTM和GRU等架构，还进行了节点敲除实验。

Result: 发现了不同架构中信息中继的独特模式，揭示了信息如何随时间处理和保持，节点敲除实验证实了识别节点的重要性。

Conclusion: 该方法不仅增进了对RNN复杂机制的理解，还为设计更鲁棒和可解释的神经网络提供了有价值的工具。

Abstract: Understanding the internal dynamics of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) is
crucial for advancing their interpretability and improving their design. This
study introduces an innovative information-theoretic method to identify and
analyze information-transfer nodes within RNNs, which we refer to as
\textit{information relays}. By quantifying the mutual information between
input and output vectors across nodes, our approach pinpoints critical pathways
through which information flows during network operations. We apply this
methodology to both synthetic and real-world time series classification tasks,
employing various RNN architectures, including Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)
networks and Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs). Our results reveal distinct patterns
of information relay across different architectures, offering insights into how
information is processed and maintained over time. Additionally, we conduct
node knockout experiments to assess the functional importance of identified
nodes, significantly contributing to explainable artificial intelligence by
elucidating how specific nodes influence overall network behavior. This study
not only enhances our understanding of the complex mechanisms driving RNNs but
also provides a valuable tool for designing more robust and interpretable
neural networks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出NcPU框架，通过非对比学习解决PU学习中表示学习困难的问题，无需辅助信息即可在复杂数据集上显著提升性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有PU学习方法在复杂数据集上性能远低于监督学习方法（如CIFAR-100上存在14.26%差距），主要瓶颈在于不可靠监督下难以学习判别性表示

Method: 结合噪声对鲁棒的非对比监督损失（NoiSNCL）和幻影标签消歧（PLD）方案，NoiSNCL在不可靠监督下对齐类内表示，PLD通过基于遗憾的标签更新提供保守负监督

Result: NoiSNCL使简单PU方法达到竞争性能；NcPU在多样化数据集上显著优于最先进的PU方法，包括灾后建筑损伤测绘等实际应用

Conclusion: NcPU框架通过理论上的EM框架迭代优化NoiSNCL和PLD，在无需辅助信息的情况下有效解决了PU学习中的表示学习瓶颈

Abstract: Positive-Unlabeled (PU) learning aims to train a binary classifier (positive
vs. negative) where only limited positive data and abundant unlabeled data are
available. While widely applicable, state-of-the-art PU learning methods
substantially underperform their supervised counterparts on complex datasets,
especially without auxiliary negatives or pre-estimated parameters (e.g., a
14.26% gap on CIFAR-100 dataset). We identify the primary bottleneck as the
challenge of learning discriminative representations under unreliable
supervision. To tackle this challenge, we propose NcPU, a non-contrastive PU
learning framework that requires no auxiliary information. NcPU combines a
noisy-pair robust supervised non-contrastive loss (NoiSNCL), which aligns
intra-class representations despite unreliable supervision, with a phantom
label disambiguation (PLD) scheme that supplies conservative negative
supervision via regret-based label updates. Theoretically, NoiSNCL and PLD can
iteratively benefit each other from the perspective of the
Expectation-Maximization framework. Empirically, extensive experiments
demonstrate that: (1) NoiSNCL enables simple PU methods to achieve competitive
performance; and (2) NcPU achieves substantial improvements over
state-of-the-art PU methods across diverse datasets, including challenging
datasets on post-disaster building damage mapping, highlighting its promise for
real-world applications. Code: Code will be open-sourced after review.

Motivation: 从人类视觉感知中的微眼动现象获得灵感，微眼动能揭示隐藏的感知动态，类似地希望通过轻量级扰动来探测LLM的潜在错误信号。

Method: 使用轻量级位置编码扰动作为探测手段，无需微调或任务特定监督，通过扰动来引发指示模型错误行为的潜在信号。

Result: 在多个先进LLM上的实验表明，该方法能有效检测事实性、安全性、毒性及后门攻击等各类错误，且计算效率高。

Conclusion: 预训练的LLM已编码了标记自身错误的内部证据，微眼动启发的干预为检测和缓解不良行为提供了可行途径。

Abstract: We draw inspiration from microsaccades, tiny involuntary eye movements that
reveal hidden dynamics of human perception, to propose an analogous probing
method for large language models (LLMs). Just as microsaccades expose subtle
but informative shifts in vision, we show that lightweight position encoding
perturbations elicit latent signals that indicate model misbehaviour. Our
method requires no fine-tuning or task-specific supervision, yet detects
failures across diverse settings including factuality, safety, toxicity, and
backdoor attacks. Experiments on multiple state-of-the-art LLMs demonstrate
that these perturbation-based probes surface misbehaviours while remaining
computationally efficient. These findings suggest that pretrained LLMs already
encode the internal evidence needed to flag their own failures, and that
microsaccade-inspired interventions provide a pathway for detecting and
mitigating undesirable behaviours.

TL;DR: ThinKV是一个思想自适应的KV缓存压缩框架，通过混合量化-驱逐策略显著减少大模型推理时的GPU内存占用，在保持接近无损精度的同时提升推理吞吐量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大模型长输出上下文生成导致的KV缓存快速增长问题，该问题会迅速耗尽GPU内存。

Method: 基于注意力稀疏性识别不同重要程度的思想类型，采用混合量化-驱逐策略，根据思想重要性分配token精度，并随着推理轨迹演化逐步驱逐不太重要的思想中的token。

Result: 在数学和编程基准测试中，ThinKV仅使用不到5%的原始KV缓存就实现了接近无损的精度，推理吞吐量比最先进基线提高了最高5.8倍。

Conclusion: ThinKV通过思想自适应压缩有效解决了KV缓存的内存瓶颈问题，为大模型的长输出推理提供了高效的内存管理方案。

Abstract: The long-output context generation of large reasoning models enables extended
chain of thought (CoT) but also drives rapid growth of the key-value (KV)
cache, quickly overwhelming GPU memory. To address this challenge, we propose
ThinKV, a thought-adaptive KV cache compression framework. ThinKV is based on
the observation that attention sparsity reveals distinct thought types with
varying importance within the CoT. It applies a hybrid quantization-eviction
strategy, assigning token precision by thought importance and progressively
evicting tokens from less critical thoughts as reasoning trajectories evolve.
Furthermore, to implement ThinKV, we design a kernel that extends
PagedAttention to enable efficient reuse of evicted tokens' memory slots,
eliminating compaction overheads. Extensive experiments on DeepSeek-R1-Distill,
GPT-OSS, and NVIDIA AceReason across mathematics and coding benchmarks show
that ThinKV achieves near-lossless accuracy with less than 5% of the original
KV cache, while improving performance with up to 5.8x higher inference
throughput over state-of-the-art baselines.

Conclusion: 该框架提高了模型的可迁移性，支持更可靠的交通信号优化、拥堵管理和基于性能的规划，促进了机器学习技术在现实交通系统中的广泛应用

Abstract: Accurate vehicle delay estimation is essential for evaluating the performance
of signalized intersections and informing traffic management strategies. Delay
reflects congestion levels and affects travel time reliability, fuel use, and
emissions. Machine learning (ML) offers a scalable, cost-effective alternative;
However, conventional models typically assume that training and testing data
follow the same distribution, an assumption that is rarely satisfied in
real-world applications. Variations in road geometry, signal timing, and driver
behavior across intersections often lead to poor generalization and reduced
model accuracy. To address this issue, this study introduces a domain
adaptation (DA) framework for estimating vehicle delays across diverse
intersections. The framework separates data into source and target domains,
extracts key traffic features, and fine-tunes the model using a small, labeled
subset from the target domain. A novel DA model, Gradient Boosting with
Balanced Weighting (GBBW), reweights source data based on similarity to the
target domain, improving adaptability. The framework is tested using data from
57 heterogeneous intersections in Pima County, Arizona. Performance is
evaluated against eight state-of-the-art ML regression models and seven
instance-based DA methods. Results demonstrate that the GBBW framework provides
more accurate and robust delay estimates. This approach supports more reliable
traffic signal optimization, congestion management, and performance-based
planning. By enhancing model transferability, the framework facilitates broader
deployment of machine learning techniques in real-world transportation systems.

Abstract: Deep learning-based 3-dimensional (3D) shape reconstruction from
2-dimensional (2D) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has become increasingly
important in medical disease diagnosis, treatment planning, and computational

shape-aware, and volumetric models. For each category, we analyze the current
state-of-the-art techniques, their methodological foundation, limitations, and
applications across anatomical structures. We provide an extensive overview
ranging from cardiac to neurological to lung imaging. We also focus on the
clinical applicability of models to diseased anatomy, and the influence of
their training and testing data. We examine publicly available datasets,
computational demands, and evaluation metrics. Finally, we highlight the
emerging research directions including multimodal integration and
cross-modality frameworks. This review aims to provide researchers with a
structured overview of current 3D reconstruction methodologies to identify
opportunities for advancing deep learning towards more robust, generalizable,
and clinically impactful solutions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究通常假设训练数据和参数是各向同性的，这限制了理论分析的实际适用性。本文旨在放宽这些假设，研究在更一般的数据分布下神经网络梯度的结构特性。

Method: 采用尖峰数据模型，允许数据主体是各向异性和病态的，不要求数据和权重矩阵独立，同时分析了均值场和神经正切核两种缩放机制。

Result: 发现输入权重梯度近似低秩，由两个秩一成分主导：一个与数据残差对齐，另一个与输入数据中的秩一尖峰对齐。数据特性、缩放机制和激活函数决定了这两个成分的平衡。

Conclusion: 标准正则化方法（如权重衰减、输入噪声和雅可比惩罚）能够选择性地调节这两个梯度成分。理论预测在合成和真实数据实验中得到了验证。

Abstract: This paper investigates low-rank structure in the gradients of the training
loss for two-layer neural networks while relaxing the usual isotropy
assumptions on the training data and parameters. We consider a spiked data
model in which the bulk can be anisotropic and ill-conditioned, we do not
require independent data and weight matrices and we also analyze both the
mean-field and neural-tangent-kernel scalings. We show that the gradient with
respect to the input weights is approximately low rank and is dominated by two
rank-one terms: one aligned with the bulk data-residue , and another aligned
with the rank one spike in the input data. We characterize how properties of
the training data, the scaling regime and the activation function govern the
balance between these two components. Additionally, we also demonstrate that
standard regularizers, such as weight decay, input noise and Jacobian
penalties, also selectively modulate these components. Experiments on synthetic
and real data corroborate our theoretical predictions.

Result: 在相同资源分配下，IDE方法在QuIIEst流形上的准确率普遍低于现有基准。随着曲率不均匀性增加，性能下降很小，表明基准本身具有较高难度。

Conclusion: QuIIEst基准为IDE方法提供了更具挑战性的测试环境，揭示了现有方法在复杂流形上的局限性。同时发现某些方法能够提取非流形空间的有效维度。

Abstract: Machine learning models can generalize well on real-world datasets. According
to the manifold hypothesis, this is possible because datasets lie on a latent
manifold with small intrinsic dimension (ID). There exist many methods for ID
estimation (IDE), but their estimates vary substantially. This warrants
benchmarking IDE methods on manifolds that are more complex than those in
existing benchmarks. We propose a Quantum-Inspired Intrinsic-dimension
Estimation (QuIIEst) benchmark consisting of infinite families of topologically
non-trivial manifolds with known ID. Our benchmark stems from a quantum-optical
method of embedding arbitrary homogeneous spaces while allowing for curvature
modification and additive noise. The IDE methods tested were generally less
accurate on QuIIEst manifolds than on existing benchmarks under identical
resource allocation. We also observe minimal performance degradation with
increasingly non-uniform curvature, underscoring the benchmark's inherent
difficulty. As a result of independent interest, we perform IDE on the fractal
Hofstadter's butterfly and identify which methods are capable of extracting the
effective dimension of a space that is not a manifold.

Abstract: We study the identifiability of latent action policy learning (LAPO), a
framework introduced recently to discover representations of actions from video
data. We formally describe desiderata for such representations, their
statistical benefits and potential sources of unidentifiability. Finally, we
prove that an entropy-regularized LAPO objective identifies action

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文从变分互信息下界出发，推导出两种自监督表示学习训练范式：自蒸馏互信息(SDMI)和联合互信息(JMI)，为现有方法的架构组件提供了理论解释。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自监督表示学习虽然取得了显著经验成功，但其基本原理理解不足。现有工作往往将预测器网络、停止梯度操作等架构元素视为经验性添加，缺乏理论依据。

Method: 从变分互信息下界出发，推导出两种训练范式：SDMI需要交替优化，停止梯度操作理论上必需；JMI允许通过对称架构进行联合优化。预测器网络和统计正则化器分别作为互信息目标的可行替代。

Result: 证明许多现有自监督学习方法都是这两种范式的具体实例或近似，为不同架构组件的选择提供了理论解释。

Conclusion: 该研究为自监督表示学习的架构设计提供了理论基础，超越了启发式便利，揭示了学习目标如何决定可能的优化策略和模型设计选择。

Abstract: Self-supervised representation learning (SSRL) has demonstrated remarkable
empirical success, yet its underlying principles remain insufficiently
understood. While recent works attempt to unify SSRL methods by examining their
information-theoretic objectives or summarizing their heuristics for preventing
representation collapse, architectural elements like the predictor network,
stop-gradient operation, and statistical regularizer are often viewed as
empirically motivated additions. In this paper, we adopt a first-principles
approach and investigate whether the learning objective of an SSRL algorithm
dictates its possible optimization strategies and model design choices. In
particular, by starting from a variational mutual information (MI) lower bound,
we derive two training paradigms, namely Self-Distillation MI (SDMI) and Joint
MI (JMI), each imposing distinct structural constraints and covering a set of
existing SSRL algorithms. SDMI inherently requires alternating optimization,
making stop-gradient operations theoretically essential. In contrast, JMI
admits joint optimization through symmetric architectures without such
components. Under the proposed formulation, predictor networks in SDMI and
statistical regularizers in JMI emerge as tractable surrogates for the MI
objective. We show that many existing SSRL methods are specific instances or
approximations of these two paradigms. This paper provides a theoretical
explanation behind the choices of different architectural components of
existing SSRL methods, beyond heuristic conveniences.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种量化数据集各向异性（对称性破缺）的方法，通过双样本神经网络分类器测试来区分原始数据集与其随机增强版本，并揭示了基准点云数据集中存在的高度对齐现象。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 对称感知方法（如数据增强和等变架构）假设变换后的数据点在测试分布中具有高概率或"重要性"，但这一假设缺乏有效的评估方法。

Method: 开发了一种度量数据集各向异性的方法，使用双样本神经网络分类器测试来区分原始数据集和其随机增强版本，并在合成和基准点云数据集上进行验证。

Result: 在多个基准点云数据集中发现了出乎意料的高度对齐现象；理论上证明分布对称性破缺会阻止不变方法达到最优性能；经验发现等变方法的有效性取决于具体数据集。

Conclusion: 理解等变性（包括其何时有效及原因）可能需要重新思考数据中的对称性偏差，等变方法在部分各向异性数据集中仍有益处，但并非所有情况都适用。

Abstract: Symmetry-aware methods for machine learning, such as data augmentation and
equivariant architectures, encourage correct model behavior on all
transformations (e.g. rotations or permutations) of the original dataset. These
methods can improve generalization and sample efficiency, under the assumption
that the transformed datapoints are highly probable, or "important", under the
test distribution. In this work, we develop a method for critically evaluating
this assumption. In particular, we propose a metric to quantify the amount of
anisotropy, or symmetry-breaking, in a dataset, via a two-sample neural
classifier test that distinguishes between the original dataset and its
randomly augmented equivalent. We validate our metric on synthetic datasets,
and then use it to uncover surprisingly high degrees of alignment in several
benchmark point cloud datasets. We show theoretically that distributional
symmetry-breaking can actually prevent invariant methods from performing
optimally even when the underlying labels are truly invariant, as we show for
invariant ridge regression in the infinite feature limit. Empirically, we find
that the implication for symmetry-aware methods is dataset-dependent:
equivariant methods still impart benefits on some anisotropic datasets, but not
others. Overall, these findings suggest that understanding equivariance -- both
when it works, and why -- may require rethinking symmetry biases in the data.

Abstract: The ability to model mechanics of soft materials under flowing conditions is
key in designing and engineering processes and materials with targeted
properties. This generally requires solution of internal stress tensor, related
to the deformation tensor through nonlinear and history-dependent constitutive
models. Traditional numerical methods for non-Newtonian fluid dynamics often
suffer from prohibitive computational demands and poor scalability to new
problem instances. Developments in data-driven methods have mitigated some
limitations but still require retraining across varied physical conditions. In
this work, we introduce Rheological Operator Transformer (RheOFormer), a
generative operator learning method leveraging self-attention to efficiently
learn different spatial interactions and features of complex fluid flows. We
benchmark RheOFormer across a range of different viscometric and
non-viscometric flows with different types of viscoelastic and
elastoviscoplastic mechanics in complex domains against ground truth solutions.
Our results demonstrate that RheOFormer can accurately learn both scalar and
tensorial nonlinear mechanics of different complex fluids and predict the
spatio-temporal evolution of their flows, even when trained on limited
datasets. Its strong generalization capabilities and computational efficiency
establish RheOFormer as a robust neural surrogate for accelerating predictive
complex fluid simulations, advancing data-driven experimentation, and enabling
real-time process optimization across a wide range of applications.

Result: 发现更好的扩散模型在特定区域更准确地近似得分函数，而在其他区域欠拟合，这解释了其生成性能。

Conclusion: 选择性欠拟合是理解扩散模型泛化和生成性能的关键，提供了新的可测试见解。

Abstract: Diffusion models have emerged as the principal paradigm for generative
modeling across various domains. During training, they learn the score
function, which in turn is used to generate samples at inference. They raise a
basic yet unsolved question: which score do they actually learn? In principle,
a diffusion model that matches the empirical score in the entire data space
would simply reproduce the training data, failing to generate novel samples.
Recent work addresses this question by arguing that diffusion models underfit
the empirical score due to training-time inductive biases. In this work, we
refine this perspective, introducing the notion of selective underfitting:
instead of underfitting the score everywhere, better diffusion models more
accurately approximate the score in certain regions of input space, while
underfitting it in others. We characterize these regions and design empirical
interventions to validate our perspective. Our results establish that selective
underfitting is essential for understanding diffusion models, yielding new,
testable insights into their generalization and generative performance.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PRISM是一种轻量级、模型无关的方法，可在推理时对掩码扩散模型进行自校正，无需重新训练或架构修改。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成模型需要自校正能力来检测和修正低质量token，但现有方法要么需要重构模型架构/训练，要么依赖不精确的token质量代理，限制了应用。

Method: PRISM通过定义自校正损失来学习每个token的质量分数，无需强化学习或验证器。这些质量分数与MDM在前向传播中同时计算，用于检测低质量token。

Result: PRISM在多个领域和规模上提升了MDM推理性能：数独、无条件文本生成（170M参数）以及代码生成（LLaDA，8B参数）。

Conclusion: PRISM为掩码扩散模型提供了一种有效的推理时自校正方法，具有理论保证和实证效果。

Abstract: A natural desideratum for generative models is self-correction--detecting and
revising low-quality tokens at inference. While Masked Diffusion Models (MDMs)
have emerged as a promising approach for generative modeling in discrete
spaces, their capacity for self-correction remains poorly understood. Prior
attempts to incorporate self-correction into MDMs either require overhauling
MDM architectures/training or rely on imprecise proxies for token quality,
limiting their applicability. Motivated by this, we introduce PRISM--Plug-in
Remasking for Inference-time Self-correction of Masked Diffusions--a
lightweight, model-agnostic approach that applies to any pretrained MDM.
Theoretically, PRISM defines a self-correction loss that provably learns
per-token quality scores, without RL or a verifier. These quality scores are
computed in the same forward pass with MDM and used to detect low-quality
tokens. Empirically, PRISM advances MDM inference across domains and scales:
Sudoku; unconditional text (170M); and code with LLaDA (8B).

TL;DR: 提出基于潘多拉盒子问题的新推理时优化框架，通过UCB算法决定何时停止生成，在不知道奖励分布的情况下实现接近最优的性能，在LLM推理中平均减少15-35%的生成次数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM生成需要在输出质量和推理成本之间平衡，特别是在多次生成时。现有方法缺乏对推理时优化的理论指导。

Method: 将每次生成视为打开一个代价高昂的"盒子"，开发UCB风格的潘多拉盒子算法，并通过Bradley-Terry变换解决跨提示的奖励缩放问题，实现自适应推理时优化。

Result: 在AlpacaFarm和HH-RLHF数据集上的实验表明，自适应策略能达到与Best-of-N采样相同的性能，同时平均减少15-35%的生成次数。

Conclusion: 在最优停止理论和推理时扩展之间建立了原则性桥梁，为LLM部署提供了理论性能边界和实际效率提升。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) generation often requires balancing output quality
against inference cost, especially when using multiple generations. We
introduce a new framework for inference-time optimization based on the
classical Pandora's Box problem. Viewing each generation as opening a costly
"box" with random reward, we develop algorithms that decide when to stop
generating without knowing the underlying reward distribution. Our first
contribution is a UCB-style Pandora's Box algorithm, which achieves performance
that is provably close to Weitzman's algorithm, the optimal strategy when the
distribution is known. We further adapt this method to practical LLM settings
by addressing reward scaling across prompts via a Bradley-Terry inspired
transformation. This leads to an adaptive inference-time optimization method
that normalizes rewards and learns stopping thresholds on the fly. Experiments
on the AlpacaFarm and HH-RLHF datasets, using multiple LLM-reward model pairs,
show that our adaptive strategy can obtain the same performance as non-adaptive
Best-of-N sampling while requiring 15-35 percent fewer generations on average.
Our results establish a principled bridge between optimal stopping theory and
inference-time scaling, providing both theoretical performance bounds and
practical efficiency gains for LLM deployment.

Conclusion: 该框架使基于梯度的自由能方法能够整合复杂和机器学习的集体变量，拓宽了生物化学和材料模拟的应用范围。

Abstract: Free energy reconstruction methods such as Gaussian Process Regression (GPR)
require Jacobians of the collective variables (CVs), a bottleneck that
restricts the use of complex or machine-learned CVs. We introduce a neural
network surrogate framework that learns CVs directly from Cartesian coordinates
and uses automatic differentiation to provide Jacobians, bypassing analytical
forms. On an MgCl2 ion-pairing system, our method achieved high accuracy for
both a simple distance CV and a complex coordination-number CV. Moreover,
Jacobian errors also followed a near-Gaussian distribution, making them
suitable for GPR pipelines. This framework enables gradient-based free energy
methods to incorporate complex and machine-learned CVs, broadening the scope of
biochemistry and materials simulations.

Conclusion: 基于低秩表示的压缩-重建框架有效解决了神经压缩中的解码器瓶颈问题，为实际应用提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Image compression and reconstruction are crucial for various digital
applications. While contemporary neural compression methods achieve impressive
compression rates, the adoption of such technology has been largely hindered by
the complexity and large computational costs of the convolution-based decoders
during data reconstruction. To address the decoder bottleneck in neural
compression, we develop a new compression-reconstruction framework based on
incorporating low-rank representation in an autoencoder with vector
quantization. We demonstrated that performing a series of computationally
efficient low-rank operations on the learned latent representation of images
can efficiently reconstruct the data with high quality. Our approach
dramatically reduces the computational overhead in the decoding phase of neural
compression/reconstruction, essentially eliminating the decoder compute
bottleneck while maintaining high fidelity of image outputs.

TL;DR: SoftAdaClip是一种差分隐私训练方法，用平滑的tanh变换替代硬裁剪，在限制敏感性的同时保持梯度相对大小，显著减少子群体间的不公平性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 差分隐私（DP）虽然提供强隐私保护，但会降低模型性能和公平性，特别是对少数群体。DP-SGD中的梯度裁剪会不成比例地抑制少数子群体的学习信号，自适应裁剪虽能提升效用但仍依赖统一的硬裁剪，可能限制公平性。

Method: 提出SoftAdaClip方法，用基于tanh的平滑变换替代硬裁剪，在限制敏感性的同时保持梯度相对大小，并与自适应机制结合。

Result: 在MIMIC-III、GOSSIS-eICU和Adult Income等数据集上的评估显示，SoftAdaClip相比DP-SGD减少子群体差异达87%，相比Adaptive-DPSGD减少达48%，且这些差异减少具有统计显著性。

Conclusion: 将平滑变换与自适应机制结合对于实现公平且私有的模型训练至关重要。

Abstract: Differential privacy (DP) provides strong protection for sensitive data, but
often reduces model performance and fairness, especially for underrepresented
groups. One major reason is gradient clipping in DP-SGD, which can
disproportionately suppress learning signals for minority subpopulations.
Although adaptive clipping can enhance utility, it still relies on uniform hard
clipping, which may restrict fairness. To address this, we introduce
SoftAdaClip, a differentially private training method that replaces hard
clipping with a smooth, tanh-based transformation to preserve relative gradient
magnitudes while bounding sensitivity. We evaluate SoftAdaClip on various
datasets, including MIMIC-III (clinical text), GOSSIS-eICU (structured
healthcare), and Adult Income (tabular data). Our results show that SoftAdaClip
reduces subgroup disparities by up to 87% compared to DP-SGD and up to 48%
compared to Adaptive-DPSGD, and these reductions in subgroup disparities are
statistically significant. These findings underscore the importance of
integrating smooth transformations with adaptive mechanisms to achieve fair and
private model training.

Abstract: Transformer architectures have achieved remarkable success in various
domains. While efficient alternatives to Softmax Attention have been widely
studied, the search for more expressive mechanisms grounded in theoretical
insight-even at greater computational cost-has been relatively underexplored.
In this work, we bridge this gap by proposing Local Linear Attention (LLA), a
novel attention mechanism derived from nonparametric statistics through the
lens of test-time regression. First, we show that LLA offers theoretical
advantages over Linear and Softmax Attention for associative memory via a
bias-variance trade-off analysis. Next, we address its computational challenges
and propose two memory-efficient primitives to tackle the $\Theta(n^2 d)$ and
$\Theta(n d^2)$ complexity. We then introduce FlashLLA, a hardware-efficient,
blockwise algorithm that enables scalable and parallel computation on modern
accelerators. In addition, we implement and profile a customized inference
kernel that significantly reduces memory overheads. Finally, we empirically
validate the advantages and limitations of LLA on test-time regression,
in-context regression, associative recall and state tracking tasks. Experiment
results demonstrate that LLA effectively adapts to non-stationarity,
outperforming strong baselines in test-time training and in-context learning,
and exhibiting promising evidence for its scalability and applicability in
large-scale models. Code is available at

TL;DR: SCOPED是一种快速通用的扩散模型OOD检测方法，通过结合雅可比迹和得分函数平方范数，大幅减少前向传播次数，在多个视觉基准测试中达到竞争性或最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: OOD检测对于机器学习系统在视觉、机器人、强化学习等领域的可靠部署至关重要，需要一种计算效率高且通用的检测方法。

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is essential for reliable deployment of
machine learning systems in vision, robotics, reinforcement learning, and
beyond. We introduce Score-Curvature Out-of-distribution Proximity Evaluator
for Diffusion (SCOPED), a fast and general-purpose OOD detection method for
diffusion models that reduces the number of forward passes on the trained model
by an order of magnitude compared to prior methods, outperforming most
diffusion-based baselines and closely approaching the accuracy of the strongest
ones. SCOPED is computed from a single diffusion model trained once on a
diverse dataset, and combines the Jacobian trace and squared norm of the
model's score function into a single test statistic. Rather than thresholding
on a fixed value, we estimate the in-distribution density of SCOPED scores
using kernel density estimation, enabling a flexible, unsupervised test that,
in the simplest case, only requires a single forward pass and one
Jacobian-vector product (JVP), made efficient by Hutchinson's trace estimator.
On four vision benchmarks, SCOPED achieves competitive or state-of-the-art
precision-recall scores despite its low computational cost. The same method
generalizes to robotic control tasks with shared state and action spaces,
identifying distribution shifts across reward functions and training regimes.
These results position SCOPED as a practical foundation for fast and reliable
OOD detection in real-world domains, including perceptual artifacts in vision,
outlier detection in autoregressive models, exploration in reinforcement
learning, and dataset curation for unsupervised training.

Method: 识别MBPO失败的两个耦合问题：动态模型与奖励模型尺度不匹配导致评论家低估，以及目标表示选择不当增加模型方差。通过解决这些问题来改进算法性能。

Abstract: Synthetic data is a core component of data-efficient Dyna-style model-based
reinforcement learning, yet it can also degrade performance. We study when it
helps, where it fails, and why, and we show that addressing the resulting
failure modes enables policy improvement that was previously unattainable. We
focus on Model-Based Policy Optimization (MBPO), which performs actor and
critic updates using synthetic action counterfactuals. Despite reports of
strong and generalizable sample-efficiency gains in OpenAI Gym, recent work
shows that MBPO often underperforms its model-free counterpart, Soft
Actor-Critic (SAC), in the DeepMind Control Suite (DMC). Although both suites
involve continuous control with proprioceptive robots, this shift leads to
sharp performance losses across seven challenging DMC tasks, with MBPO failing
in cases where claims of generalization from Gym would imply success. This
reveals how environment-specific assumptions can become implicitly encoded into
algorithm design when evaluation is limited. We identify two coupled issues
behind these failures: scale mismatches between dynamics and reward models that
induce critic underestimation and hinder policy improvement during model-policy
coevolution, and a poor choice of target representation that inflates model
variance and produces error-prone rollouts. Addressing these failure modes
enables policy improvement where none was previously possible, allowing MBPO to
outperform SAC in five of seven tasks while preserving the strong performance
previously reported in OpenAI Gym. Rather than aiming only for incremental
average gains, we hope our findings motivate the community to develop
taxonomies that tie MDP task- and environment-level structure to algorithmic
failure modes, pursue unified solutions where possible, and clarify how
benchmark choices ultimately shape the conditions under which algorithms
generalize.

### [43] [How Well Can Preference Optimization Generalize Under Noisy Feedback?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01458)
*Shawn Im,Yixuan Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文研究了噪声反馈对大型语言模型偏好优化的影响，为在噪声条件下提供了泛化保证，分析了不同类型噪声对泛化性能的影响，并验证了理论发现在当代LLM中的实际相关性。

Result: 理论分析表明泛化性能随噪声类型和噪声率的变化而衰减，经验验证证实了理论发现在当代LLM中的实际相关性。

Conclusion: 该研究为在噪声条件下开发符合人类偏好的AI系统提供了有价值的见解，适用于DPO、IPO、SLiC等多种偏好优化损失函数。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) advance their capabilities, aligning these
models with human preferences has become crucial. Preference optimization,
which trains models to distinguish between preferred and non-preferred
responses based on human feedback, has become a crucial component for aligning
LLMs. However, most existing works assume noise-free feedback, which is
unrealistic due to the inherent errors and inconsistencies in human judgments.
This paper addresses the impact of noisy feedback on preference optimization,
providing generalization guarantees under these conditions. In particular, we
consider noise models that correspond to common real-world sources of noise,
such as mislabeling and uncertainty. Unlike traditional analyses that assume
convergence, our work focuses on finite-step preference optimization, offering
new insights that are more aligned with practical LLM training. We describe how
generalization decays with different types of noise across levels of noise
rates based on the preference data distribution and number of samples. Our
analysis for noisy preference learning applies to a broad family of preference
optimization losses such as DPO, IPO, SLiC, etc. Empirical validation on
contemporary LLMs confirms the practical relevance of our findings, offering
valuable insights for developing AI systems that align with human preferences.

TL;DR: 提出了LSPO算法，一种基于响应长度的动态采样元RLVR方法，能有效提升语言模型在推理任务上的学习效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 受到LLMs中过度思考现象研究的启发，旨在通过动态选择训练数据来提高RLVR的效率。

Method: LSPO（Length-aware Sampling for Policy Optimization），一种元RLVR算法，根据平均响应长度在每个步骤动态选择训练数据。

Result: 在多个基础模型和数据集上的评估表明，LSPO能持续提升学习效果。消融研究进一步验证了将长度信号融入动态采样的有效性。

Conclusion: LSPO为RLVR训练提供了有效的动态采样策略，并指出了将长度信息融入训练的未来研究方向。

Abstract: Since the release of Deepseek-R1, reinforcement learning with verifiable
rewards (RLVR) has become a central approach for training large language models
(LLMs) on reasoning tasks. Recent work has largely focused on modifying loss
functions to make RLVR more efficient and effective. In this paper, motivated
by studies of overthinking in LLMs, we propose Length-aware Sampling for Policy
Optimization (LSPO), a novel meta-RLVR algorithm that dynamically selects
training data at each step based on the average response length. We evaluate
LSPO across multiple base models and datasets, demonstrating that it
consistently improves learning effectiveness. In addition, we conduct a
detailed ablation study to examine alternative ways of incorporating length
signals into dynamic sampling, offering further insights and highlighting
promising directions for future research.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一个稳定性-可塑性原则来解释离线到在线强化学习中的不一致性，认为应该保留预训练策略或离线数据集中更好的知识，同时保持足够的可塑性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 离线到在线强化学习的经验行为高度不一致，在一个设置中有效的在线微调设计选择在另一个设置中可能完全失败。

Method: 提出了一个稳定性-可塑性原则框架，将在线微调分为三个需要不同稳定性特性的机制，并通过大规模实证研究验证该框架。

Result: 在63个案例中有45个案例的结果与该框架的预测高度一致。

Conclusion: 这项工作为基于离线数据集和预训练策略相对性能的离线到在线强化学习设计选择提供了一个原则性框架。

Abstract: Offline-to-online reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a practical
paradigm that leverages offline datasets for pretraining and online
interactions for fine-tuning. However, its empirical behavior is highly
inconsistent: design choices of online-fine tuning that work well in one
setting can fail completely in another. We propose a stability--plasticity
principle that can explain this inconsistency: we should preserve the knowledge
of pretrained policy or offline dataset during online fine-tuning, whichever is
better, while maintaining sufficient plasticity. This perspective identifies
three regimes of online fine-tuning, each requiring distinct stability
properties. We validate this framework through a large-scale empirical study,
finding that the results strongly align with its predictions in 45 of 63 cases.
This work provides a principled framework for guiding design choices in
offline-to-online RL based on the relative performance of the offline dataset
and the pretrained policy.

*Haotian Xiang,Jinwen Xu,Qin Lu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于LLM的贝叶斯优化方法，使用LoRA微调和变分贝叶斯线性层来处理高维不规则变量的黑盒优化问题，并通过集成方法自动选择超参数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统高斯过程在应对高维不规则变量（如分类、序数变量）的黑盒优化问题时表现不佳，而神经网络代理模型计算成本高。LLM具有强大的建模能力，但需要适应特定优化问题。

Method: 采用LLM作为代理模型，使用LoRA进行轻量级微调，结合变分贝叶斯线性层框架。开发了集成方法来自动选择LoRA秩和其他超参数，支持递归更新。

Result: 在各种高维基准测试和实际分子优化任务中，提出的(ENS-)LoRA-VBLL方法表现出色，性能优于现有替代方案。

Conclusion: 基于LLM的代理模型结合LoRA微调和变分贝叶斯方法，为高维不规则变量的黑盒优化问题提供了高效且性能优越的解决方案。

Abstract: A plethora of applications entail solving black-box optimization problems
with high evaluation costs, including drug discovery, material design, as well
as hyperparameter tuning. Toward finding the global optimum of such black-box
optimization problems with sample efficiency, Bayesian optimization (BO) is a
theoretically elegant framework that relies on a probabilistic surrogate model
so as to iteratively select the query point with well-balanced
exploration-exploitation tradeoffs. The Gaussian process (GP), as the de-facto
choice for surrogate modeling, has achieved compelling performances for vanilla
BO with low-dimensional continuous variables. However, GPs fall short in coping
with high-dimensional counterparts with {\it irregular} variables (e.g.,
categorical, ordinal, etc.). To alleviate this, neural network-based surrogates
have been explored. Inspired by the powerful capabilities of LLMs, we adopt the
LLM as the surrogate to model the mapping from the high-dimensional input
variables to the objective function. To adapt to the current problem, we
leverage the low-rank adaptation (LoRA) to fine-tune the LLM parameters
together with the posterior of a linear regression head via the variational
Bayesian last layer (VBLL) framework. The resulting LoRA-VBLL is not only
computationally light compared to existing alternatives, but also admits
recursive updates. To automate the critical selection of the LoRA rank as well
as other hyperparameters, a weighted ensemble (ENS) of LoRA-VBLL surrogates has
been devised, which further accommodates continual update of the per-model
weight and individual LoRA-VBLL parameters via recursive Bayes. Extensive
experimental results demonstrate the compelling performance of the proposed
(ENS-)LoRA-VBLL approaches on various high-dimensional benchmarks and the
real-world molecular optimization tasks.

*Hengyi Zhu,Grace Li Zhang,Shaoyi Huang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PEL-NAS是一种基于大语言模型的神经架构搜索方法，通过搜索空间分区、架构提示协同进化和零成本预测器，解决了传统方法搜索成本高和LLM方法探索偏差的问题，在保持精度的同时显著降低延迟和搜索时间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统超网络方法需要多GPU天/数据集，而LLM驱动方法存在探索偏差，无法在整个搜索空间中发现不同延迟范围的架构。需要一种既能快速搜索又能避免探索偏差的HW-NAS方法。

Method: 1) 复杂度驱动的分区引擎按复杂度划分搜索空间；2) LLM驱动的架构提示协同进化算子，LLM基于先前结果更新设计启发式知识库，然后执行引导进化；3) 零成本预测器避免从头训练大量候选架构。

Result: 在HW-NAS-Bench上，PEL-NAS实现了更高的HV、更低的IGD，在相似精度下延迟比基线降低达54%，搜索成本从几天降至几分钟。

Conclusion: PEL-NAS通过分区和协同进化有效解决了LLM的探索偏差问题，在保持精度的同时显著降低了延迟和搜索时间，为硬件感知神经架构搜索提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Hardware-Aware Neural Architecture Search (HW-NAS) requires joint
optimization of accuracy and latency under device constraints. Traditional
supernet-based methods require multiple GPU days per dataset. Large Language
Model (LLM)-driven approaches avoid training a large supernet and can provide
quick feedback, but we observe an exploration bias: the LLM repeatedly proposes
neural network designs within limited search space and fails to discover
architectures across different latency ranges in the entire search space. To
address this issue, we propose PEL-NAS: a search space Partitioned,
architecture prompt co-Evolutionary and LLM-driven Neural Architecture Search
that can generate neural networks with high accuracy and low latency with
reduced search cost. Our proposed PEL-NAS has three key components: 1) a
complexity-driven partitioning engine that divides the search space by
complexity to enforce diversity and mitigate exploration bias; 2) an
LLM-powered architecture prompt co-evolution operator, in which the LLM first
updates a knowledge base of design heuristics based on results from the
previous round, then performs a guided evolution algorithm on architectures
with prompts that incorporate this knowledge base. Prompts and designs improve
together across rounds which avoids random guesswork and improve efficiency; 3)
a zero-cost predictor to avoid training a large number of candidates from
scratch. Experimental results show that on HW-NAS-Bench, PEL-NAS can achieve
overall higher HV, lower IGD, and up to 54% lower latency than baselines at
similar accuracy. Meanwhile, the search cost drops from days to minutes
compared with traditional supernet baselines.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出Density-Ratio Weighted Behavioral Cloning (Weighted BC)方法，使用小型干净参考集通过二元判别器估计轨迹级密度比，在BC目标中加权以优先干净专家行为，提升离线强化学习在数据污染下的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 离线强化学习数据集常被对抗性投毒、系统错误或低质量样本污染，导致标准行为克隆和离线RL方法性能下降，需要开发对数据污染鲁棒的方法。

Method: 使用小型干净参考集训练二元判别器估计轨迹级密度比，对密度比进行裁剪后作为权重用于行为克隆目标，优先学习干净专家行为，无需知道污染机制。

Result: 建立了包含多种投毒协议的综合评估框架，实验显示Weighted BC在高污染率下仍能保持接近最优性能，优于传统BC、BCQ和BRAC等基线方法。

Conclusion: Weighted BC通过密度比加权有效提升了离线强化学习对数据污染的鲁棒性，具有理论保证且在实际应用中表现优异。

Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (RL) enables policy optimization from fixed
datasets, making it suitable for safety-critical applications where online
exploration is infeasible. However, these datasets are often contaminated by
adversarial poisoning, system errors, or low-quality samples, leading to
degraded policy performance in standard behavioral cloning (BC) and offline RL
methods. This paper introduces Density-Ratio Weighted Behavioral Cloning
(Weighted BC), a robust imitation learning approach that uses a small, verified
clean reference set to estimate trajectory-level density ratios via a binary
discriminator. These ratios are clipped and used as weights in the BC objective
to prioritize clean expert behavior while down-weighting or discarding
corrupted data, without requiring knowledge of the contamination mechanism. We
establish theoretical guarantees showing convergence to the clean expert policy
with finite-sample bounds that are independent of the contamination rate. A
comprehensive evaluation framework is established, which incorporates various
poisoning protocols (reward, state, transition, and action) on continuous
control benchmarks. Experiments demonstrate that Weighted BC maintains
near-optimal performance even at high contamination ratios outperforming
baselines such as traditional BC, batch-constrained Q-learning (BCQ) and
behavior regularized actor-critic (BRAC).

TL;DR: 该研究揭示了对抗性攻击可转移性的根本区别：输入数据空间的攻击可以转移，而模型表示空间的攻击则不能转移，除非表示空间几何对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解释为什么图像越狱攻击在视觉语言模型之间无法成功转移，而传统对抗样本和文本越狱攻击可以转移，探究对抗性转移的根本机制。

Method: 通过四个不同场景提供理论和实证证据：1）数学证明相同输入输出映射但不同表示的网络；2）构建图像分类器的表示空间攻击；3）构建语言模型的表示空间攻击；4）构建视觉语言模型的数据空间攻击和表示空间对齐实验。

Result: 数据空间攻击成功转移，表示空间攻击无法转移，但当视觉语言模型的潜在几何在投影后空间充分对齐时，表示空间攻击也可以转移。

Conclusion: 对抗性转移并非所有攻击的固有属性，而是取决于其操作域——共享数据空间与模型独特表示空间，这对构建更鲁棒模型具有关键意义。

Abstract: The field of adversarial robustness has long established that adversarial
examples can successfully transfer between image classifiers and that text
jailbreaks can successfully transfer between language models (LMs). However, a
pair of recent studies reported being unable to successfully transfer image
jailbreaks between vision-language models (VLMs). To explain this striking
difference, we propose a fundamental distinction regarding the transferability
of attacks against machine learning models: attacks in the input data-space can
transfer, whereas attacks in model representation space do not, at least not
without geometric alignment of representations. We then provide theoretical and
empirical evidence of this hypothesis in four different settings. First, we
mathematically prove this distinction in a simple setting where two networks
compute the same input-output map but via different representations. Second, we
construct representation-space attacks against image classifiers that are as
successful as well-known data-space attacks, but fail to transfer. Third, we
construct representation-space attacks against LMs that successfully jailbreak
the attacked models but again fail to transfer. Fourth, we construct data-space
attacks against VLMs that successfully transfer to new VLMs, and we show that
representation space attacks \emph{can} transfer when VLMs' latent geometries
are sufficiently aligned in post-projector space. Our work reveals that
adversarial transfer is not an inherent property of all attacks but contingent
on their operational domain - the shared data-space versus models' unique
representation spaces - a critical insight for building more robust models.

Motivation: 标准多数投票方法平等对待所有答案，忽略了模型间的潜在异质性和相关性，需要更有效的聚合方法。

Method: 设计了两种新算法：最优权重(OW)和逆惊喜流行度(ISP)，利用一阶和二阶信息来改进聚合效果。

Result: 在合成数据集、UltraFeedback和MMLU等LLM微调基准以及ARMMAN医疗场景中，新方法始终优于多数投票。

Conclusion: OW和ISP方法不仅提供实际性能提升，还为设计稳健的多智能体LLM管道提供了概念性见解。

Abstract: With the rapid progress of multi-agent large language model (LLM) reasoning,
how to effectively aggregate answers from multiple LLMs has emerged as a
fundamental challenge. Standard majority voting treats all answers equally,
failing to consider latent heterogeneity and correlation across models. In this
work, we design two new aggregation algorithms called Optimal Weight (OW) and
Inverse Surprising Popularity (ISP), leveraging both first-order and
second-order information. Our theoretical analysis shows these methods provably
mitigate inherent limitations of majority voting under mild assumptions,
leading to more reliable collective decisions. We empirically validate our
algorithms on synthetic datasets, popular LLM fine-tuning benchmarks such as
UltraFeedback and MMLU, and a real-world healthcare setting ARMMAN. Across all
cases, our methods consistently outperform majority voting, offering both
practical performance gains and conceptual insights for the design of robust
multi-agent LLM pipelines.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) applications in Clinical Decision Support Systems
(CDSS) frequently encounter skepticism from practitioners regarding inoperable
dosing decisions. We address this challenge with an end-to-end approach for
learning optimal drug dosing and control policies for dual vasopressor
administration in intensive care unit (ICU) patients with septic shock. For
realistic drug dosing, we apply action space design that accommodates discrete,
continuous, and directional dosing strategies in a system that combines offline
conservative Q-learning with a novel recurrent modeling in a replay buffer to
capture temporal dependencies in ICU time-series data. Our comparative analysis
of norepinephrine dosing strategies across different action space formulations
reveals that the designed action spaces improve interpretability and facilitate
clinical adoption while preserving efficacy. Empirical results1 on eICU and
MIMIC demonstrate that action space design profoundly influences learned
behavioral policies. The proposed methods achieve improved patient outcomes of
over 15% in survival improvement probability, while aligning with established
clinical protocols.

<details>

Motivation: 传统知识图谱基础模型(KGFMs)的确定性等变性限制了其表达能力，无法区分结构相似但语义不同的关系。需要突破这一限制以实现更好的零样本泛化能力。

Method: 提出概率性节点-关系等变性，在保持分布等变性的同时引入随机化来打破对称性。Flock模型通过迭代采样随机游走、编码序列、序列建模和池化聚合来学习节点和关系的表示。

Conclusion: 概率性等变性是提升知识图谱基础模型表达能力的关键，Flock模型证明了其在零样本链接预测任务中的有效性。

Abstract: We study the problem of zero-shot link prediction on knowledge graphs (KGs),
which requires models to generalize over novel entities and novel relations.
Knowledge graph foundation models (KGFMs) address this task by enforcing
equivariance over both nodes and relations, learning from structural properties
of nodes and relations, which are then transferable to novel graphs with
similar structural properties. However, the conventional notion of
deterministic equivariance imposes inherent limits on the expressive power of
KGFMs, preventing them from distinguishing structurally similar but
semantically distinct relations. To overcome this limitation, we introduce
probabilistic node-relation equivariance, which preserves equivariance in
distribution while incorporating a principled randomization to break symmetries
during inference. Building on this principle, we present Flock, a KGFM that
iteratively samples random walks, encodes them into sequences via a recording
protocol, embeds them with a sequence model, and aggregates representations of
nodes and relations via learned pooling. Crucially, Flock respects
probabilistic node-relation equivariance and is a universal approximator for
isomorphism-invariant link-level functions over KGs. Empirically, Flock
perfectly solves our new diagnostic dataset Petals where current KGFMs fail,
and achieves state-of-the-art performances on entity- and relation prediction
tasks on 54 KGs from diverse domains.

Abstract: The safe use of pharmaceuticals in food-producing animals is vital to protect
animal welfare and human food safety. Adverse events (AEs) may signal
unexpected pharmacokinetic or toxicokinetic effects, increasing the risk of
violative residues in the food chain. This study introduces a predictive
framework for classifying outcomes (Death vs. Recovery) using ~1.28 million
reports (1987-2025 Q1) from the U.S. FDA's OpenFDA Center for Veterinary
Medicine. A preprocessing pipeline merged relational tables and standardized
AEs through VeDDRA ontologies. Data were normalized, missing values imputed,
and high-cardinality features reduced; physicochemical drug properties were
integrated to capture chemical-residue links. We evaluated supervised models,
including Random Forest, CatBoost, XGBoost, ExcelFormer, and large language
models (Gemma 3-27B, Phi 3-12B). Class imbalance was addressed, such as
undersampling and oversampling, with a focus on prioritizing recall for fatal
outcomes. Ensemble methods(Voting, Stacking) and CatBoost performed best,
achieving precision, recall, and F1-scores of 0.95. Incorporating Average
Uncertainty Margin (AUM)-based pseudo-labeling of uncertain cases improved
minority-class detection, particularly in ExcelFormer and XGBoost.
Interpretability via SHAP identified biologically plausible predictors,
including lung, heart, and bronchial disorders, animal demographics, and drug
physicochemical properties. These features were strongly linked to fatal
outcomes. Overall, the framework shows that combining rigorous data
engineering, advanced machine learning, and explainable AI enables accurate,
interpretable predictions of veterinary safety outcomes. The approach supports
FARAD's mission by enabling early detection of high-risk drug-event profiles,
strengthening residue risk assessment, and informing regulatory and clinical
decision-making.

TL;DR: CarbonX是一个基于时间序列基础模型的开源工具，用于碳强度预测和插补等脱碳任务，仅需历史碳强度数据即可在全球214个电网实现零样本预测，MAPE为15.82%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有碳强度预测工具存在三大限制：需要电网特定电力结构数据、依赖单独电网模型难以提供全球覆盖、缺乏不确定性估计。这限制了碳感知应用的可靠性。

Method: 利用时间序列基础模型的通用性，仅使用历史碳强度数据和单一通用模型，支持零样本预测、插补等多种任务，并提供预测区间。

Result: 在214个全球电网实现15.82% MAPE的零样本预测；在13个基准电网平均MAPE为9.59%，尾部预测MAPE为16.54%，提供95%覆盖的预测区间；可预测21天且精度下降最小；插补任务比统计基线提升1.2-3.9倍。

Conclusion: CarbonX能够在数据有限的情况下在任何电网使用并提供强大性能，是实用的全球规模脱碳工具。

Abstract: Computational decarbonization aims to reduce carbon emissions in computing
and societal systems such as data centers, transportation, and built
environments. This requires accurate, fine-grained carbon intensity forecasts,
yet existing tools have several key limitations: (i) they require grid-specific
electricity mix data, restricting use where such information is unavailable;
(ii) they depend on separate grid-specific models that make it challenging to
provide global coverage; and (iii) they provide forecasts without uncertainty
estimates, limiting reliability for downstream carbon-aware applications.
  In this paper, we present CarbonX, an open-source tool that leverages Time
Series Foundation Models (TSFMs) for a range of decarbonization tasks. CarbonX
utilizes the versatility of TSFMs to provide strong performance across multiple
tasks, such as carbon intensity forecasting and imputation, and across diverse
grids. Using only historical carbon intensity data and a single general model,
our tool achieves a zero-shot forecasting Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE)
of 15.82% across 214 grids worldwide. Across 13 benchmark grids, CarbonX
performance is comparable with the current state-of-the-art, with an average
MAPE of 9.59% and tail forecasting MAPE of 16.54%, while also providing
prediction intervals with 95% coverage. CarbonX can provide forecasts for up to
21 days with minimal accuracy degradation. Further, when fully fine-tuned,
CarbonX outperforms the statistical baselines by 1.2--3.9X on the imputation
task. Overall, these results demonstrate that CarbonX can be used easily on any
grid with limited data and still deliver strong performance, making it a
practical tool for global-scale decarbonization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 二值神经网络的验证问题通常被建模为整数规划问题，但传统方法由于大M约束导致的积分间隙而难以求解，需要更有效的公式化方法。

Method: 1) 为多分类场景设计新的线性目标函数；2) 利用BNN的递归结构生成有效不等式来改进整数规划公式。

Result: 相比现有IP方法，本文方法在有限时间内能够验证BNN对抗更大范围的输入扰动。

Conclusion: 提出的两种技术显著改善了BNN验证的整数规划公式，提高了验证效率和鲁棒性评估能力。

Abstract: Binarized neural networks (BNNs) are feedforward neural networks with binary
weights and activation functions. In the context of using a BNN for
classification, the verification problem seeks to determine whether a small
perturbation of a given input can lead it to be misclassified by the BNN, and
the robustness of the BNN can be measured by solving the verification problem
over multiple inputs. The BNN verification problem can be formulated as an
integer programming (IP) problem. However, the natural IP formulation is often
challenging to solve due to a large integrality gap induced by big-$M$
constraints. We present two techniques to improve the IP formulation. First, we
introduce a new method for obtaining a linear objective for the multi-class
setting. Second, we introduce a new technique for generating valid inequalities
for the IP formulation that exploits the recursive structure of BNNs. We find
that our techniques enable verifying BNNs against a higher range of input
perturbation than existing IP approaches within a limited time.

*Lecheng Kong,Xiyuan Wang,Yixin Chen,Muhan Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了Round-Trip Reinforcement Learning (RTRL)框架，通过将往返一致性作为奖励信号来训练化学大语言模型，显著提升了模型性能和一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有化学大语言模型在双向任务中缺乏往返一致性，表明模型学习的是单向记忆而非灵活掌握，这种不一致性与主要任务性能密切相关。

Method: 引入RTRL框架，使用往返转换成功作为奖励信号训练模型；提出迭代变体，让前向和反向映射在自改进循环中交替训练彼此。

Result: RTRL在监督、自监督和合成数据机制下显著提升了基线模型的性能和一致性。

Conclusion: 往返一致性不仅是理想属性，而且是可训练目标，为构建更稳健可靠的基座模型提供了新路径。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are emerging as versatile foundation models for
computational chemistry, handling bidirectional tasks like reaction prediction
and retrosynthesis. However, these models often lack round-trip consistency.
For instance, a state-of-the-art chemical LLM may successfully caption a
molecule, yet be unable to accurately reconstruct the original structure from
its own generated text. This inconsistency suggests that models are learning
unidirectional memorization rather than flexible mastery. Indeed, recent work
has demonstrated a strong correlation between a model's round-trip consistency
and its performance on the primary tasks. This strong correlation reframes
consistency into a direct target for model improvement. We therefore introduce
Round-Trip Reinforcement Learning (RTRL), a novel framework that trains a model
to improve its consistency by using the success of a round-trip transformation
as a reward signal. We further propose an iterative variant where forward and
reverse mappings alternately train each other in a self-improvement loop, a
process that is highly data-efficient and notably effective with the massive
amount of unlabelled data common in chemistry. Experiments demonstrate that
RTRL significantly \textbf{boosts performance and consistency} over strong
baselines across supervised, self-supervised, and synthetic data regimes. This
work shows that round-trip consistency is not just a desirable property but a
trainable objective, offering a new path toward more robust and reliable
foundation models.

TL;DR: 提出一种绕过提示防护的新攻击方法，利用提示防护与主LLM之间的资源不对称性，成功越狱多个生产模型，揭示轻量级提示防护的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型发展，AI安全和对齐变得至关重要。提示防护是流行的轻量级防护机制，但本研究旨在揭示其安全漏洞。

Method: 利用提示防护与主LLM之间的资源不对称性，编码一个轻量级防护无法解码但主模型可以解码的越狱提示。

Result: 该方法在Google Gemini、DeepSeek Chat、Grok和Mistral Le Chat等高度保护的聊天接口中持续实现越狱，同时保持响应质量。

Conclusion: 揭示了现代LLM架构中轻量级提示防护固有的攻击面，强调需要将防御重点从阻止恶意输入转向防止恶意输出。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) advance, ensuring AI safety and alignment is
paramount. One popular approach is prompt guards, lightweight mechanisms
designed to filter malicious queries while being easy to implement and update.
In this work, we introduce a new attack that circumvents such prompt guards,
highlighting their limitations. Our method consistently jailbreaks production
models while maintaining response quality, even under the highly protected chat
interfaces of Google Gemini (2.5 Flash/Pro), DeepSeek Chat (DeepThink), Grok
(3), and Mistral Le Chat (Magistral). The attack exploits a resource asymmetry
between the prompt guard and the main LLM, encoding a jailbreak prompt that
lightweight guards cannot decode but the main model can. This reveals an attack
surface inherent to lightweight prompt guards in modern LLM architectures and
underscores the need to shift defenses from blocking malicious inputs to
preventing malicious outputs. We additionally identify other critical alignment
issues, such as copyrighted data extraction, training data extraction, and
malicious response leakage during thinking.

Abstract: 6G brings a paradigm shift towards AI-native wireless systems, necessitating
the seamless integration of digital signal processing (DSP) and machine
learning (ML) within the software stacks of cellular networks. This
transformation brings the life cycle of modern networks closer to AI systems,
where models and algorithms are iteratively trained, simulated, and deployed
across adjacent environments. In this work, we propose a robust framework that
compiles Python-based algorithms into GPU-runnable blobs. The result is a
unified approach that ensures efficiency, flexibility, and the highest possible
performance on NVIDIA GPUs. As an example of the capabilities of the framework,
we demonstrate the efficacy of performing the channel estimation function in
the PUSCH receiver through a convolutional neural network (CNN) trained in
Python. This is done in a digital twin first, and subsequently in a real-time
testbed. Our proposed methodology, realized in the NVIDIA AI Aerial platform,
lays the foundation for scalable integration of AI/ML models into
next-generation cellular systems, and is essential for realizing the vision of
natively intelligent 6G networks.

Motivation: 传统时间序列预测方法需要大量人工干预，且现有模型泛化能力差，亟需一个减少人工干预的通用、领域无关的预测框架。

Method: 框架包含四个专门代理：Curator进行LLM引导的数据诊断和预处理；Planner通过多模态诊断缩小模型选择空间；Forecaster执行模型拟合、验证和自适应集成；Reporter生成透明报告。

Conclusion: TSci成功将预测工作流转化为白盒系统，在保持高性能的同时显著提高了可解释性和跨任务扩展性。

Abstract: Time series forecasting is central to decision-making in domains as diverse
as energy, finance, climate, and public health. In practice, forecasters face
thousands of short, noisy series that vary in frequency, quality, and horizon,
where the dominant cost lies not in model fitting, but in the labor-intensive
preprocessing, validation, and ensembling required to obtain reliable
predictions. Prevailing statistical and deep learning models are tailored to
specific datasets or domains and generalize poorly. A general, domain-agnostic
framework that minimizes human intervention is urgently in demand. In this
paper, we introduce TimeSeriesScientist (TSci), the first LLM-driven agentic
framework for general time series forecasting. The framework comprises four
specialized agents: Curator performs LLM-guided diagnostics augmented by
external tools that reason over data statistics to choose targeted
preprocessing; Planner narrows the hypothesis space of model choice by
leveraging multi-modal diagnostics and self-planning over the input; Forecaster
performs model fitting and validation and, based on the results, adaptively
selects the best model configuration as well as ensemble strategy to make final
predictions; and Reporter synthesizes the whole process into a comprehensive,
transparent report. With transparent natural-language rationales and
comprehensive reports, TSci transforms the forecasting workflow into a
white-box system that is both interpretable and extensible across tasks.
Empirical results on eight established benchmarks demonstrate that TSci
consistently outperforms both statistical and LLM-based baselines, reducing
forecast error by an average of 10.4% and 38.2%, respectively. Moreover, TSci
produces a clear and rigorous report that makes the forecasting workflow more
transparent and interpretable.

TL;DR: 本文提出了可执行反事实框架，通过代码和数学问题评估LLM的反事实推理能力，发现从干预推理到反事实推理准确率下降25-40%，并证明强化学习能有效提升泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估LLM反事实推理能力的方法往往跳过溯因步骤，导致高估模型性能。需要开发能完整评估三个推理步骤的框架，以提升LLM在科学等高风险领域的应用。

Method: 引入可执行反事实框架，通过代码和数学问题操作化因果推理，要求完整执行溯因、干预和预测三个步骤，并创建可扩展的合成数据。

Result: SOTA模型从干预推理到反事实推理准确率下降25-40%。监督微调能提升域内性能但损害OOD泛化，而强化学习在代码和数学问题上均实现1.5-2倍提升，且能泛化到新领域。

Conclusion: 强化学习能有效诱导核心认知行为并实现跨领域泛化，为提升LLM反事实推理能力提供了有前景的方向。

Abstract: Counterfactual reasoning, a hallmark of intelligence, consists of three
steps: inferring latent variables from observations (abduction), constructing
alternatives (interventions), and predicting their outcomes (prediction). This
skill is essential for advancing LLMs' causal understanding and expanding their
applications in high-stakes domains such as scientific research. However,
existing efforts in assessing LLM's counterfactual reasoning capabilities tend
to skip the abduction step, effectively reducing to interventional reasoning
and leading to overestimation of LLM performance. To address this, we introduce
executable counterfactuals, a novel framework that operationalizes causal
reasoning through code and math problems. Our framework explicitly requires all
three steps of counterfactual reasoning and enables scalable synthetic data
creation with varying difficulty, creating a frontier for evaluating and
improving LLM's reasoning. Our results reveal substantial drop in accuracy
(25-40%) from interventional to counterfactual reasoning for SOTA models like
o4-mini and Claude-4-Sonnet. To address this gap, we construct a training set
comprising counterfactual code problems having if-else condition and test on
out-of-domain code structures (e.g. having while-loop); we also test whether a
model trained on code would generalize to counterfactual math word problems.
While supervised finetuning on stronger models' reasoning traces improves
in-domain performance of Qwen models, it leads to a decrease in accuracy on OOD
tasks such as counterfactual math problems. In contrast, reinforcement learning
induces the core cognitive behaviors and generalizes to new domains, yielding
gains over the base model on both code (improvement of 1.5x-2x) and math
problems. Analysis of the reasoning traces reinforces these findings and
highlights the promise of RL for improving LLMs' counterfactual reasoning.

Motivation: 现有交互式模仿学习方法只修正当前状态的动作，不调整未来可能更危险状态的动作

Method: 将每次人类干预引导到L个未来时间步（偏好视野），假设智能体执行相同动作且人类进行相同干预，在这些未来状态上应用偏好优化

Result: 在自动驾驶和机器人操作基准测试中验证了方法的效率和通用性，显著提高了学习效率并减少了人类演示需求

Conclusion: 选择合适的偏好视野L可以在风险状态覆盖和标签正确性之间取得平衡，从而限制算法最优性差距

Abstract: Learning from human involvement aims to incorporate the human subject to
monitor and correct agent behavior errors. Although most interactive imitation
learning methods focus on correcting the agent's action at the current state,
they do not adjust its actions in future states, which may be potentially more
hazardous. To address this, we introduce Predictive Preference Learning from
Human Interventions (PPL), which leverages the implicit preference signals
contained in human interventions to inform predictions of future rollouts. The
key idea of PPL is to bootstrap each human intervention into L future time
steps, called the preference horizon, with the assumption that the agent
follows the same action and the human makes the same intervention in the
preference horizon. By applying preference optimization on these future states,
expert corrections are propagated into the safety-critical regions where the
agent is expected to explore, significantly improving learning efficiency and
reducing human demonstrations needed. We evaluate our approach with experiments
on both autonomous driving and robotic manipulation benchmarks and demonstrate
its efficiency and generality. Our theoretical analysis further shows that
selecting an appropriate preference horizon L balances coverage of risky states
with label correctness, thereby bounding the algorithmic optimality gap. Demo
and code are available at: https://metadriverse.github.io/ppl

TL;DR: MIRA是一种无需训练、在推理时对齐扩散模型的方法，通过图像空间的KL代理正则化来防止奖励黑客行为，在保持提示一致性的同时提高奖励分数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型生成的图像虽然符合文本提示，但往往无法满足用户特定的标量奖励标准（如美学评分）。现有的推理时对齐方法存在奖励黑客问题，即模型生成高分数但偏离原始提示的图像。

Method: 提出MIRA方法，引入图像空间的基于分数的KL代理，使用冻结的主干网络正则化采样轨迹，约束输出分布以避免奖励黑客。还开发了MIRA-DPO，将偏好优化映射到推理时间，适用于不可微分的奖励。

Result: 在SDv1.5和SDXL模型、多种奖励函数（美学评分、HPSv2、PickScore）和公共数据集上，MIRA相对于强基线实现了超过60%的胜率，同时保持提示一致性。机制图显示奖励增益接近零漂移，而DNO方法随着计算增加而漂移。

Conclusion: MIRA提供了一种有效的推理时对齐方法，能够在不进行微调的情况下提高扩散模型的奖励分数，同时防止奖励黑客行为，适用于各种可微分和不可微分的奖励函数。

Abstract: Diffusion models excel at generating images conditioned on text prompts, but
the resulting images often do not satisfy user-specific criteria measured by
scalar rewards such as Aesthetic Scores. This alignment typically requires
fine-tuning, which is computationally demanding. Recently, inference-time
alignment via noise optimization has emerged as an efficient alternative,
modifying initial input noise to steer the diffusion denoising process towards
generating high-reward images. However, this approach suffers from reward
hacking, where the model produces images that score highly, yet deviate
significantly from the original prompt. We show that noise-space regularization
is insufficient and that preventing reward hacking requires an explicit
image-space constraint. To this end, we propose MIRA (MItigating Reward
hAcking), a training-free, inference-time alignment method. MIRA introduces an
image-space, score-based KL surrogate that regularizes the sampling trajectory
with a frozen backbone, constraining the output distribution so reward can
increase without off-distribution drift (reward hacking). We derive a tractable
approximation to KL using diffusion scores. Across SDv1.5 and SDXL, multiple
rewards (Aesthetic, HPSv2, PickScore), and public datasets (e.g.,
Animal-Animal, HPDv2), MIRA achieves >60\% win rate vs. strong baselines while
preserving prompt adherence; mechanism plots show reward gains with near-zero
drift, whereas DNO drifts as compute increases. We further introduce MIRA-DPO,
mapping preference optimization to inference time with a frozen backbone,
extending MIRA to non-differentiable rewards without fine-tuning.

TL;DR: 本文分析了RLHF中KL散度正则化的不同实现方式，证明了'k1 in reward'（如PPO）和'k2 as loss'在策略条件下梯度等价，都是RKL正则化的理论正确实现，而'k3 as loss'（如GRPO）只是有偏的一阶近似。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RLHF方法中KL散度正则化的实现存在混淆，有些方法将其作为数值估计系数而非优化损失，需要建立统一框架来分析不同实现方式的理论基础。

Method: 建立统一框架连接两种实现风格：将数学项kn作为策略评分函数的分离系数（'kn in reward'）或作为直接传播梯度的损失函数（'kn as loss'），并通过梯度等价性分析证明其关系。

Result: 证明'k1 in reward'是RKL正则化的原则性损失，在策略条件下'k2 as loss'与'k1 in reward'梯度等价，而'k3 as loss'是有偏的一阶近似。针对离策略实现提出原则性修正。

Conclusion: 为KL正则化的选择和正确实现提供了全面的梯度理论基础，有助于构建更稳健有效的RLHF系统。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) leverages a
Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence loss to stabilize training and prevent
overfitting. However, in methods such as GRPO, its implementation may be guided
by principles from numerical value estimation-a practice that overlooks the
term's functional role as an optimization loss. To analyze this issue, we
establish a unified framework that connects two seemingly distinct
implementation styles: using the mathematical term $k_n$ as a detached
coefficient for the policy's score function ('$k_n$ in reward') or as a direct
loss function through which gradients are propagated ('$k_n$ as loss'). We show
that the latter can always be analyzed via an equivalent gradient coefficient
in the former, unifying the two perspectives. Through this framework, we prove
that the conventional '$k_1$ in reward' (like in PPO) is the principled loss
for Reverse KL (RKL) regularization. We further establish a key finding: under
on-policy conditions, the '$k_2$ as loss' formulation is, in fact,
gradient-equivalent to '$k_1$ in reward'. This equivalence, first proven in our
work, identifies both as the theoretically sound implementations of the RKL
objective. In contrast, we show that the recently adopted '$k_3$ as loss' (like
in GRPO) is merely a first-order, biased approximation of the principled loss.
Furthermore, we argue that common off-policy implementations of '$k_n$ as loss'
methods are biased due to neglected importance sampling, and we propose a
principled correction. Our findings provide a comprehensive, gradient-based
rationale for choosing and correctly implementing KL regularization, paving the
way for more robust and effective RLHF systems.

<details>

Motivation: 现有因果发现方法在大规模任务上性能较差且无法量化不确定性，而高通量基因组扰动数据为改进模型识别提供了机会。

Method: 采用经验贝叶斯框架，建模总因果效应矩阵的似然（近似矩阵正态分布），使用尖峰-平板马蹄先验，从观测数据中学习无标度和Erdős-Rényi结构的权重，将每条边作为潜变量进行不确定性感知推断。

Result: 在大量模拟实验中，IBCD在结构恢复方面优于现有基线方法；应用于521个基因的CRISPR扰动数据，边缘后验包含概率能够识别稳健的图结构。

Conclusion: IBCD框架在因果发现中表现出优越性能，能够有效处理大规模任务并提供不确定性量化，为基因组扰动数据的因果推断提供了有力工具。

Abstract: Inferring the causal relationships among a set of variables in the form of a
directed acyclic graph (DAG) is an important but notoriously challenging
problem. Recently, advancements in high-throughput genomic perturbation screens
have inspired development of methods that leverage interventional data to
improve model identification. However, existing methods still suffer poor
performance on large-scale tasks and fail to quantify uncertainty. Here, we
propose Interventional Bayesian Causal Discovery (IBCD), an empirical Bayesian
framework for causal discovery with interventional data. Our approach models
the likelihood of the matrix of total causal effects, which can be approximated
by a matrix normal distribution, rather than the full data matrix. We place a
spike-and-slab horseshoe prior on the edges and separately learn data-driven
weights for scale-free and Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi structures from observational
data, treating each edge as a latent variable to enable uncertainty-aware
inference. Through extensive simulation, we show that IBCD achieves superior
structure recovery compared to existing baselines. We apply IBCD to CRISPR
perturbation (Perturb-seq) data on 521 genes, demonstrating that edge posterior
inclusion probabilities enable identification of robust graph structures.

Motivation: 探索强化学习是否能推动蛋白质语言模型超越其预训练先验，揭示潜在的序列-结构-功能规则，并评估RL在蛋白质设计中的实际价值。

Method: 在四个领域（抗菌肽设计、激酶变体优化、抗体工程和反向折叠）中，将多种RL算法与不同类别的PLM配对，比较RL与监督学习的表现。

Result: RL在所有基准测试中一致提高了成功率和采样效率。性能提升取决于三个因素的交互作用：任务改进空间、奖励准确性和策略容量。

Conclusion: 为蛋白质设计中的RL应用提供了实用指导：优先考虑奖励建模和校准，根据任务难度匹配算法和正则化强度，在边际收益最大的地方分配容量。

Abstract: Protein language models (PLMs) have advanced computational protein science
through large-scale pretraining and scalable architectures. In parallel,
reinforcement learning (RL) has broadened exploration and enabled precise
multi-objective optimization in protein design. Yet whether RL can push PLMs
beyond their pretraining priors to uncover latent sequence-structure-function
rules remains unclear. We address this by pairing RL with PLMs across four
domains: antimicrobial peptide design, kinase variant optimization, antibody
engineering, and inverse folding. Using diverse RL algorithms and model
classes, we ask if RL improves sampling efficiency and, more importantly, if it
reveals capabilities not captured by supervised learning. Across benchmarks, RL
consistently boosts success rates and sample efficiency. Performance follows a
three-factor interaction: task headroom, reward fidelity, and policy capacity
jointly determine gains. When rewards are accurate and informative, policies
have sufficient capacity, and tasks leave room beyond supervised baselines,
improvements scale; when rewards are noisy or capacity is constrained, gains
saturate despite exploration. This view yields practical guidance for RL in
protein design: prioritize reward modeling and calibration before scaling
policy size, match algorithm and regularization strength to task difficulty,
and allocate capacity where marginal gains are largest. Implementation is
available at https://github.com/chq1155/RL-PLM.

Motivation: 传统梯度裁剪使用固定的硬阈值，缺乏灵活性且忽略了梯度分布动态变化的问题，限制了深度网络训练的优化效果。

Method: SPAMP框架跟踪局部梯度统计信息，动态估计阈值，并应用基于幂的变换来以可微分方式调制更新幅度，将裁剪和预热重新表述为控制有效更新尺度的双重机制。

Result: 在图像和语言任务上的广泛实验表明，SPAMP在稳定性、收敛性和鲁棒性方面优于现有方法。

Conclusion: SPAMP提供了一个原则性的替代方案，取代了僵硬的启发式方法，通过统一的梯度整形框架显著改善了深度网络训练效果。

Abstract: Gradient clipping is widely used to stabilize deep network training, but its
formulation as a hard, fixed threshold limits flexibility and ignores gradient
distribution dynamics. We propose SPAMP (Statistical Per-layer Adaptive
Modulation and Projection), a unified framework that generalizes clipping into
smooth, per-layer gradient shaping. SPAMP tracks local gradient statistics,
dynamically estimates thresholds, and applies power-based transformations to
modulate update magnitudes in a differentiable manner. This perspective recasts
clipping and warmup as dual mechanisms for controlling the effective update
scale $\eta_t \|g_t\|$, offering a principled alternative to rigid heuristics.
Extensive experiments across image and language tasks demonstrate that SPAMP
improves stability, convergence, and robustness over existing methods.

TL;DR: TRAAC是一种在线后训练强化学习方法，通过自适应压缩推理步骤来解决模型在复杂推理任务中的欠适应性问题，平衡欠思考和过度思考，提高准确率同时减少推理长度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有思维模型在复杂推理任务中面临欠适应性问题：简单问题过度思考导致token效率低下，复杂问题欠思考导致错误。需要根据任务难度自适应调整推理长度。

Method: 提出TRAAC方法，利用模型在长推理轨迹上的自注意力识别重要步骤并剪枝冗余步骤，同时估计任务难度并将其纳入训练奖励，学习根据示例难度分配推理预算。

Result: 在多种任务上，TRAAC相比基础模型平均绝对准确率提升8.4%，推理长度相对减少36.8%；相比最佳RL基线准确率提升7.9%，长度减少29.4%。在分布外非数学数据集上也表现出强泛化能力。

Conclusion: TRAAC通过任务难度校准和基于注意力的压缩相结合，能够根据难度进行细粒度思考预算调整，在多样化任务上实现准确率和效率的提升。

Abstract: Recent thinking models solve complex reasoning tasks by scaling test-time
compute, but this scaling must be allocated in line with task difficulty. On
one hand, short reasoning (underthinking) leads to errors on harder problems
that require extended reasoning steps; but, excessively long reasoning
(overthinking) can be token-inefficient, generating unnecessary steps even
after reaching a correct intermediate solution. We refer to this as
under-adaptivity, where the model fails to modulate its response length
appropriately given problems of varying difficulty. To address under-adaptivity
and strike a balance between under- and overthinking, we propose TRAAC (Think
Right with Adaptive, Attentive Compression), an online post-training RL method
that leverages the model's self-attention over a long reasoning trajectory to
identify important steps and prune redundant ones. TRAAC also estimates
difficulty and incorporates it into training rewards, thereby learning to
allocate reasoning budget commensurate with example difficulty. Our approach
improves accuracy, reduces reasoning steps, and enables adaptive thinking
compared to base models and other RL baselines. Across a variety of tasks
(AIME, AMC, GPQA-D, BBEH), TRAAC (Qwen3-4B) achieves an average absolute
accuracy gain of 8.4% with a relative reduction in reasoning length of 36.8%
compared to the base model, and a 7.9% accuracy gain paired with a 29.4% length
drop compared to the best RL baseline. TRAAC also shows strong generalization:
although our models are trained on math datasets, they show accuracy and
efficiency gains on out-of-distribution non-math datasets like GPQA-D, BBEH,
and OptimalThinkingBench. Our analysis further verifies that TRAAC provides
fine-grained adjustments to thinking budget based on difficulty and that a
combination of task-difficulty calibration and attention-based compression
yields gains across diverse tasks.

Result: 通过可定制噪声注入模块的评估方法，实验表明NoRo能显著提升不同下游预测模型在各种噪声环境下的UPDRS预测鲁棒性。

Conclusion: NoRo框架有效解决了帕金森病远程监测中的噪声问题，为临床实践提供了更可靠的UPDRS评分预测工具。

Abstract: Parkinson's disease (PD) is one of the most common neurodegenerative
disorder. PD telemonitoring emerges as a novel assessment modality enabling
self-administered at-home tests of Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale
(UPDRS) scores, enhancing accessibility for PD patients. However, three types
of noise would occur during measurements: (1) patient-induced measurement
inaccuracies, (2) environmental noise, and (3) data packet loss during
transmission, resulting in higher prediction errors. To address these
challenges, NoRo, a noise-robust UPDRS prediction framework is proposed. First,
the original speech features are grouped into ordered bins, based on the
continuous values of a selected feature, to construct contrastive pairs.
Second, the contrastive pairs are employed to train a multilayer perceptron
encoder for generating noise-robust features. Finally, these features are
concatenated with the original features as the augmented features, which are
then fed into the UPDRS prediction models. Notably, we further introduces a
novel evaluation approach with customizable noise injection module, and
extensive experiments show that NoRo can successfully enhance the noise
robustness of UPDRS prediction across various downstream prediction models
under different noisy environments.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文提出使用自旋转移矩磁隧道结(STT-MTJs)生成硬件真随机数，以解决生成式AI模型中伪随机数生成器的安全漏洞问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成式AI模型中使用的确定性伪随机数生成器会产生可预测模式，易受攻击者利用，而传统防御方法存在显著的能耗和延迟开销。

Method: 开发基于STT-MTJs的硬件真随机数生成系统，通过FPGA辅助的原型计算系统实现高并行性，将硬件随机比特集成到生成对抗网络中。

Result: 系统能以兆比特/秒的速度生成真随机数，通过NIST随机性测试，在CIFAR-10训练的GAN中，相比低质量随机数生成器基线，不安全输出减少了18.6倍。

Conclusion: 基于STT-MTJ的系统具有纳秒级切换速度、高能效和可扩展性，有望扩展到超过10^6个并行单元，实现千兆比特/秒的吞吐量，适合大型语言模型采样，突显了自旋电子随机数生成器作为下一代GAI系统实用安全组件的潜力。

Abstract: Deterministic pseudo random number generators (PRNGs) used in generative
artificial intelligence (GAI) models produce predictable patterns vulnerable to
exploitation by attackers. Conventional defences against the vulnerabilities
often come with significant energy and latency overhead. Here, we embed
hardware-generated true random bits from spin-transfer torque magnetic tunnel
junctions (STT-MTJs) to address the challenges. A highly parallel,
FPGA-assisted prototype computing system delivers megabit-per-second true
random numbers, passing NIST randomness tests after in-situ operations with
minimal overhead. Integrating the hardware random bits into a generative
adversarial network (GAN) trained on CIFAR-10 reduces insecure outputs by up to
18.6 times compared to the low-quality random number generators (RNG) baseline.
With nanosecond switching speed, high energy efficiency, and established
scalability, our STT-MTJ-based system holds the potential to scale beyond 106
parallel cells, achieving gigabit-per-second throughput suitable for large
language model sampling. This advancement highlights spintronic RNGs as
practical security components for next-generation GAI systems.

Motivation: 深入理解变分自编码器中后验塌陷现象的本质，揭示其不仅是优化失败，而是数据结构和变分约束相互作用产生的相变现象。

Method: 通过分析后验塌陷相关平凡解的稳定性，识别临界超参数阈值，并在合成和真实数据集上验证临界行为。

Result: 发现后验塌陷与近似后验和先验分布之间KL散度的不连续性相关，确认了相变的存在，临界边界区分了有意义的潜在推断和塌陷状态。

Conclusion: 后验塌陷是一种新兴的相变现象，这一视角为深度生成模型的可训练性和表示能力提供了新见解。

Abstract: We investigate the phenomenon of posterior collapse in variational
autoencoders (VAEs) from the perspective of statistical physics, and reveal
that it constitutes a phase transition governed jointly by data structure and
model hyper-parameters. By analyzing the stability of the trivial solution
associated with posterior collapse, we identify a critical hyper-parameter
threshold. This critical boundary, separating meaningful latent inference from
collapse, is characterized by a discontinuity in the KL divergence between the
approximate posterior and the prior distribution. We validate this critical
behavior on both synthetic and real-world datasets, confirming the existence of
a phase transition. Our results demonstrate that posterior collapse is not
merely an optimization failure, but rather an emerging phase transition arising
from the interplay between data structure and variational constraints. This
perspective offers new insights into the trainability and representational
capacity of deep generative models.

*Feiyang Kang,Michael Kuchnik,Karthik Padthe,Marin Vlastelica,Ruoxi Jia,Carole-Jean Wu,Newsha Ardalani*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文挑战了SFT高分能提升RL性能的传统观点，发现SFT分数可能偏向简单数据，不能可靠预测RL效果。提出了泛化损失和Pass@large k作为更好的RL结果预测指标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM推理后训练采用SFT和RL两个独立阶段，但高SFT分数是否真的能提升RL性能存在疑问。作者发现SFT分数可能具有偏差，需要寻找更可靠的预测指标。

Method: 训练了数百个12B参数模型，使用SFT和GRPO进行RLVR，在7个数学基准上进行了多达256次重复的广泛评估，花费超过100万GPU小时。

Result: 泛化损失和Pass@large k相比直接基于SFT性能预测，显著提高了预测精度，R²系数和Spearman秩相关系数提升高达0.5（2倍）。

Conclusion: SFT分数不是RL结果的可靠预测指标，泛化损失和Pass@large k提供了更强的预测能力，对实际应用有重要价值。

Abstract: In post-training for reasoning Large Language Models (LLMs), the current
state of practice trains LLMs in two independent stages: Supervised Fine-Tuning
(SFT) and Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR, shortened as
``RL'' below). In this work, we challenge whether high SFT scores translate to
improved performance after RL. We provide extensive counter-examples where this
is not true. We find high SFT scores can be biased toward simpler or more
homogeneous data and are not reliably predictive of subsequent RL gains or
scaled-up post-training effectiveness. In some cases, RL training on models
with improved SFT performance could lead to substantially worse outcome
compared to RL on the base model without SFT. We study alternative metrics and
identify generalization loss on held-out reasoning examples and Pass@large k
performance to provide strong proxies for the RL outcome. We trained hundreds
of models up to 12B-parameter with SFT and RLVR via GRPO and ran extensive
evaluations on 7 math benchmarks with up to 256 repetitions, spending $>$1M GPU
hours. Experiments include models from Llama3, Mistral-Nemo, Qwen3 and multiple
state-of-the-art SFT/RL datasets. Compared to directly predicting from pre-RL
performance, prediction based on generalization loss and Pass@large k achieves
substantial higher precision, improving $R^2$ coefficient and Spearman's rank
correlation coefficient by up to 0.5 (2x). This provides strong utility for
broad use cases. For example, in most experiments, we find SFT training on
unique examples for a one epoch underperforms training on half examples for two
epochs, either after SFT or SFT-then-RL; With the same SFT budget, training
only on short examples may lead to better SFT performance, though, it often
leads to worse outcome after RL compared to training on examples with varying
lengths. Evaluation tool will be open-sourced.

TL;DR: 大规模实证研究表明：单独使用改写式合成数据预训练效果不优于自然网络文本，但1/3改写合成数据与2/3自然数据混合可加速5-10倍；单独使用教科书式合成数据会导致下游任务性能下降；合成数据最佳比例约为30%，且8B参数生成器已足够。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高质量训练数据对LLM扩展至关重要但供应有限，合成数据技术可能突破这一限制，需要系统评估不同合成数据类型的实际效果。

Method: 使用统一协议和缩放定律进行大规模实证研究（>1000个LLM，>10万GPU小时），比较自然网络数据、多种合成数据（改写文本、生成教科书）及其混合。

Result: 改写合成数据单独使用效果不佳，但与自然数据混合可显著加速训练；教科书式合成数据单独使用性能较差；合成数据最佳比例约30%；8B参数生成器效果足够；改写合成数据未见模型崩溃，但教科书式合成数据存在模型崩溃迹象。

Conclusion: 合成数据在预训练中具有条件性优势，改写式合成数据与自然数据混合使用效果最佳，为实际应用提供了实用指导。

Abstract: Training data plays a crucial role in Large Language Models (LLM) scaling,
yet high quality data is of limited supply. Synthetic data techniques offer a
potential path toward sidestepping these limitations. We conduct a large-scale
empirical investigation (>1000 LLMs with >100k GPU hours) using a unified
protocol and scaling laws, comparing natural web data, diverse synthetic types
(rephrased text, generated textbooks), and mixtures of natural and synthetic
data. Specifically, we found pre-training on rephrased synthetic data
\textit{alone} is not faster than pre-training on natural web texts; while
pre-training on 1/3 rephrased synthetic data mixed with 2/3 natural web texts
can speed up 5-10x (to reach the same validation loss) at larger data budgets.
Pre-training on textbook-style synthetic data \textit{alone} results in notably
higher loss on many downstream domains especially at small data budgets. "Good"
ratios of synthetic data in training data mixtures depend on the model size and
data budget, empirically converging to ~30% for rephrased synthetic data.
Larger generator models do not necessarily yield better pre-training data than
~8B-param models. These results contribute mixed evidence on "model collapse"
during large-scale single-round (n=1) model training on synthetic
data--training on rephrased synthetic data shows no degradation in performance
in foreseeable scales whereas training on mixtures of textbook-style
pure-generated synthetic data shows patterns predicted by "model collapse". Our
work demystifies synthetic data in pre-training, validates its conditional
benefits, and offers practical guidance.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了曲率自适应Transformer（CAT），通过可学习的门控机制动态路由token到三种几何注意力分支，解决了传统Transformer在非欧几里得数据上的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统Transformer假设欧几里得几何，限制了在非欧几里得结构数据上的效果。现有方法需要预先选择单一几何，无法适应混合几何特性的数据。

Method: 使用轻量级可微分门控机制，动态学习每个token在三种几何注意力分支（双曲、球面、欧几里得）之间的路由。每个分支采用针对各自流形优化的几何特定操作。

Result: 在知识图谱补全基准测试（FB15k-237, WN18RR）上，相比固定几何基线，MRR和Hits@10指标提升约10%，仅增加5%参数，推理时间相当。

Conclusion: 学习几何自适应优于任何单一固定几何，CAT为跨语言、视觉和多模态领域的混合几何架构提供了可扩展和可解释的基础。

Abstract: Transformers achieve strong performance across diverse domains but implicitly
assume Euclidean geometry in their attention mechanisms, limiting their
effectiveness on data with non-Euclidean structure. While recent extensions to
hyperbolic and spherical spaces show promise for hierarchical and cyclical
patterns, respectively, they require committing to a single geometry a priori,
reducing flexibility when data exhibits mixed geometric properties. We
introduce the Curvature-Adaptive Transformer (CAT), a novel architecture that
dynamically learns per-token routing across three geometric attention branches
through a lightweight, differentiable gating mechanism. Unlike fixed-geometry
approaches, CAT enables adaptive geometric specialization, routing tokens to
the appropriate curvature based on their local relational structure. The
routing network provides interpretable curvature preferences while each branch
employs geometry-specific operations optimized for its respective manifold. On
knowledge graph completion benchmarks (FB15k-237, WN18RR), CAT achieves
approximately 10% improvements in MRR and Hits@10 over fixed-geometry baselines
with minimal overhead (5% parameter increase, comparable inference time). These
results demonstrate that learned geometric adaptation outperforms any single
fixed geometry for complex relational reasoning, establishing CAT as a scalable
and interpretable foundation for mixture-of-geometry architectures across
language, vision, and multimodal domains.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在现实场景中，LLM生成的内容可能经过后生成编辑（如人工修订或欺骗攻击），因此需要检测和定位这些修改。

Method: 组合模式水印框架：将词汇表划分为不相交子集，在生成过程中通过在这些子集上强制执行确定性组合模式来嵌入水印，并设计全局统计量检测水印和轻量级本地统计量定位编辑。

Result: 在开源LLM和各种编辑场景下评估，展示了在编辑定位方面的强大实证性能。

Conclusion: 提出的组合水印方法能够有效检测和定位水印LLM输出中的后生成编辑，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Watermarking has become a key technique for proprietary language models,
enabling the distinction between AI-generated and human-written text. However,
in many real-world scenarios, LLM-generated content may undergo post-generation
edits, such as human revisions or even spoofing attacks, making it critical to
detect and localize such modifications. In this work, we introduce a new task:
detecting post-generation edits locally made to watermarked LLM outputs. To
this end, we propose a combinatorial pattern-based watermarking framework,
which partitions the vocabulary into disjoint subsets and embeds the watermark
by enforcing a deterministic combinatorial pattern over these subsets during
generation. We accompany the combinatorial watermark with a global statistic
that can be used to detect the watermark. Furthermore, we design lightweight
local statistics to flag and localize potential edits. We introduce two
task-specific evaluation metrics, Type-I error rate and detection accuracy, and
evaluate our method on open-source LLMs across a variety of editing scenarios,
demonstrating strong empirical performance in edit localization.

<details>

Motivation: 软注意力机制的二次复杂度是扩展大语言模型的主要瓶颈，现有次二次近似算法仅在受限的有界条目假设下有效，而该假设在实际中很少成立。

Method: 利用查询和键矩阵的子高斯特性，将大条目和小条目分离，在稀疏组件上精确计算，在密集组件上使用多项式近似，并扩展到多阈值设置以消除所有分布假设。

Result: 建立了严格的理论保证，证明了次二次运行时间，并为多项式注意力的经验成功提供了首个理论证明。

Conclusion: 支持基分解框架为软注意力提供了有效的次二次近似方法，突破了现有算法的限制，并理论证明了多项式注意力的有效性。

Abstract: The quadratic complexity of softmax attention remains a central bottleneck in
scaling large language models (LLMs). [Alman and Song, NeurIPS 2023] proposed a
sub-quadratic attention approximation algorithm, but it works only under the
restrictive bounded-entry assumption. Since this assumption rarely holds in
practice, its applicability to modern LLMs is limited.
  In this paper, we introduce support-basis decomposition, a new framework for
efficient attention approximation beyond bounded entries. We empirically
demonstrate that the entries of the query and key matrices exhibit sub-Gaussian
behavior. Our approach uses this property to split large and small entries,
enabling exact computation on sparse components and polynomial approximation on
dense components. We establish rigorous theoretical guarantees, proving a
sub-quadratic runtime, and extend the method to a multi-threshold setting that
eliminates all distributional assumptions. Furthermore, we provide the first
theoretical justification for the empirical success of polynomial attention
[Kacham, Mirrokni, and Zhong, ICML 2024], showing that softmax attention can be
closely approximated by a combination of multiple polynomial attentions with
sketching.

Motivation: 现有跨域持续学习方法需要完全标记的源域数据，这在隐私受限环境中不可行。本文旨在解决无源跨域持续学习问题，完全禁止使用源域样本。

Method: 结合源预训练模型和大规模视觉语言模型，采用频率感知提示技术（鼓励低频抑制高频）、不确定性加权策略（基于预测不确定性加权均值和协方差矩阵）、核线性判别分析（冻结主干网络，使用随机核方法指导的线性判别分析）。

Conclusion: REFEREE方法成功解决了无源跨域持续学习问题，通过频率感知动态提示协作有效处理域漂移、噪声伪标签和灾难性遗忘，性能优于需要源域样本的现有方法。

Abstract: Although existing cross-domain continual learning approaches successfully
address many streaming tasks having domain shifts, they call for a fully
labeled source domain hindering their feasibility in the privacy constrained
environments. This paper goes one step ahead with the problem of source-free
cross-domain continual learning where the use of source-domain samples are
completely prohibited. We propose the idea of rehearsal-free frequency-aware
dynamic prompt collaborations (REFEREE) to cope with the absence of labeled
source-domain samples in realm of cross-domain continual learning. REFEREE is
built upon a synergy between a source-pre-trained model and a large-scale
vision-language model, thus overcoming the problem of sub-optimal
generalizations when relying only on a source pre-trained model. The domain
shift problem between the source domain and the target domain is handled by a
frequency-aware prompting technique encouraging low-frequency components while
suppressing high-frequency components. This strategy generates frequency-aware
augmented samples, robust against noisy pseudo labels. The noisy pseudo-label
problem is further addressed with the uncertainty-aware weighting strategy
where the mean and covariance matrix are weighted by prediction uncertainties,
thus mitigating the adverse effects of the noisy pseudo label. Besides, the
issue of catastrophic forgetting (CF) is overcome by kernel linear discriminant
analysis (KLDA) where the backbone network is frozen while the classification
is performed using the linear discriminant analysis approach guided by the
random kernel method. Our rigorous numerical studies confirm the advantage of
our approach where it beats prior arts having access to source domain samples
with significant margins.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Elsa的神经网络剪枝方法，通过约束优化技术突破了现有方法在50-60%稀疏度下的瓶颈，实现了高达90%的极端稀疏度，同时保持高模型精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统神经网络剪枝方法在达到中等稀疏度（50-60%）后难以进一步提升，否则会严重损害模型精度，这限制了大型语言模型的计算和内存效率优化。

Method: Elsa方法基于ADMM约束优化技术，直接解决了现有方法依赖代理目标函数的局限性，并提出了量化变体Elsa-L以扩展到超大规模模型。

Result: 在广泛的模型和规模实验中，Elsa显著优于现有方法，在LLaMA-2-7B模型90%稀疏度下，困惑度比最佳现有方法低7.8倍，并能扩展到27B超大规模模型。

Conclusion: 这项工作在推进LLM稀疏化前沿方面取得了有意义的进展，表明在目前探索有限的方向上仍存在显著的进一步改进机会。

Abstract: Neural network pruning is a promising technique to mitigate the excessive
computational and memory requirements of large language models (LLMs). Despite
its promise, however, progress in this area has diminished, as conventional
methods are seemingly unable to surpass moderate sparsity levels (50-60%)
without severely degrading model accuracy. This work breaks through the current
impasse, presenting a principled and effective method called $\texttt{Elsa}$,
which achieves extreme sparsity levels of up to 90% while retaining high model
fidelity. This is done by identifying several limitations in current practice,
all of which can be traced back to their reliance on a surrogate objective
formulation. $\texttt{Elsa}$ tackles this issue directly and effectively via
standard and well-established constrained optimization techniques based on
ADMM. Our extensive experiments across a wide range of models and scales show
that $\texttt{Elsa}$ achieves substantial improvements over existing methods;
e.g., it achieves 7.8$\times$ less perplexity than the best existing method on
LLaMA-2-7B at 90% sparsity. Furthermore, we present
$\texttt{Elsa}_{\text{-L}}$, a quantized variant that scales to extremely large
models (27B), and establish its theoretical convergence guarantees. These
results highlight meaningful progress in advancing the frontier of LLM
sparsity, while promising that significant opportunities for further
advancement may remain in directions that have so far attracted limited
exploration.

TL;DR: AsyPPO是一种针对大语言模型强化学习的创新架构，通过引入轻量级mini-critics集合来解决传统价值函数在LLM规模下的计算瓶颈，提升学习稳定性和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前RL4LLM方法避免使用显式critics，主要因为传统价值函数在LLM规模下计算成本高，且在稀疏奖励和长推理视野下容易失效。作者从架构角度重新审视这一瓶颈。

Method: AsyPPO采用一组轻量级mini-critics，每个critic在不同提示分片上训练，鼓励多样性同时保持校准。利用critics间的不确定性来优化策略更新：在critics一致的状态中屏蔽优势值，从熵正则化中过滤高分歧状态。

Result: 仅用5000个样本训练后，AsyPPO在多个基准测试中持续提升学习稳定性和性能，相比GRPO等强基线，在Qwen3-4b-Base上获得超过6%的性能提升，在Qwen3-8b-Base和Qwen3-14b-Base上获得约3%的提升。

Conclusion: 这些结果强调了架构创新对于可扩展、高效算法的重要性，AsyPPO成功恢复了critics在RL4LLM中的作用，同时保持了大模型设置下的效率。

Abstract: Most recent RL for LLMs (RL4LLM) methods avoid explicit critics, replacing
them with average advantage baselines. This shift is largely pragmatic:
conventional value functions are computationally expensive to train at LLM
scale and often fail under sparse rewards and long reasoning horizons. We
revisit this bottleneck from an architectural perspective and introduce
Asymmetric Proximal Policy Optimization (AsyPPO), a simple and scalable
framework that restores the critics role while remaining efficient in
large-model settings. AsyPPO employs a set of lightweight mini-critics, each
trained on disjoint prompt shards. This design encourages diversity while
preserving calibration, reducing value-estimation bias. Beyond robust
estimation, AsyPPO leverages inter-critic uncertainty to refine the policy
update: (i) masking advantages in states where critics agree and gradients add
little learning signal, and (ii) filtering high-divergence states from entropy
regularization, suppressing spurious exploration. After training on open-source
data with only 5,000 samples, AsyPPO consistently improves learning stability
and performance across multiple benchmarks over strong baselines, such as GRPO,
achieving performance gains of more than six percent on Qwen3-4b-Base and about
three percent on Qwen3-8b-Base and Qwen3-14b-Base over classic PPO, without
additional tricks. These results highlight the importance of architectural
innovations for scalable, efficient algorithms.

Motivation: 为了在嵌入空间中有效平衡均匀性和容忍度特性，学习具有强表示能力的时间序列表示。

Method: 使用层次化设置学习实例级和时间信息，集成温度调度器平衡均匀性和容忍度，应用层次化角度边界损失增强正负样本对的几何边界。

Conclusion: TimeHUT通过层次化均匀性-容忍度平衡机制有效提升了时间序列表示学习性能，在多个任务上表现出色。

Abstract: We propose TimeHUT, a novel method for learning time-series representations
by hierarchical uniformity-tolerance balancing of contrastive representations.
Our method uses two distinct losses to learn strong representations with the
aim of striking an effective balance between uniformity and tolerance in the
embedding space. First, TimeHUT uses a hierarchical setup to learn both
instance-wise and temporal information from input time-series. Next, we
integrate a temperature scheduler within the vanilla contrastive loss to
balance the uniformity and tolerance characteristics of the embeddings.
Additionally, a hierarchical angular margin loss enforces instance-wise and
temporal contrast losses, creating geometric margins between positive and
negative pairs of temporal sequences. This approach improves the coherence of
positive pairs and their separation from the negatives, enhancing the capture
of temporal dependencies within a time-series sample. We evaluate our approach
on a wide range of tasks, namely 128 UCR and 30 UAE datasets for univariate and
multivariate classification, as well as Yahoo and KPI datasets for anomaly
detection. The results demonstrate that TimeHUT outperforms prior methods by
considerable margins on classification, while obtaining competitive results for
anomaly detection. Finally, detailed sensitivity and ablation studies are
performed to evaluate different components and hyperparameters of our method.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: KAN网络虽然能恢复符号表示，但其独特架构给网络剪枝带来挑战。传统基于幅度的剪枝方法由于对输入坐标偏移敏感而不可靠。

Method: 使用Shapley值归因来评估节点重要性，以平移不变的方式量化每个节点的实际贡献，确保重要性排名不受输入参数化影响。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上的广泛实验表明，ShapKAN能保持真实的节点重要性，同时实现有效的网络压缩。

Conclusion: ShapKAN提高了KAN的可解释性优势，便于在资源受限环境中部署。

Abstract: For many real-world applications, understanding feature-outcome relationships
is as crucial as achieving high predictive accuracy. While traditional neural
networks excel at prediction, their black-box nature obscures underlying
functional relationships. Kolmogorov--Arnold Networks (KANs) address this by
employing learnable spline-based activation functions on edges, enabling
recovery of symbolic representations while maintaining competitive performance.
However, KAN's architecture presents unique challenges for network pruning.
Conventional magnitude-based methods become unreliable due to sensitivity to
input coordinate shifts. We propose \textbf{ShapKAN}, a pruning framework using
Shapley value attribution to assess node importance in a shift-invariant
manner. Unlike magnitude-based approaches, ShapKAN quantifies each node's
actual contribution, ensuring consistent importance rankings regardless of
input parameterization. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world
datasets demonstrate that ShapKAN preserves true node importance while enabling
effective network compression. Our approach improves KAN's interpretability
advantages, facilitating deployment in resource-constrained environments.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种自适应门控融合网络（AGFN），通过基于信息熵和模态重要性的双门融合机制自适应调整特征权重，以解决多模态情感分析中模态质量变化（如噪声、缺失、语义冲突）的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多模态情感分析中，简单的融合技术往往无法考虑模态质量的变化（如噪声、缺失或语义冲突），导致性能不佳，特别是在识别细微情感变化方面。

Method: 采用自适应门控融合网络，通过双门融合机制（基于信息熵和模态重要性）自适应调整特征权重，在单模态编码和跨模态交互后优先考虑信息丰富的线索，减少噪声模态的影响。

Result: 在CMU-MOSI和CMU-MOSEI数据集上的实验表明，AGFN在准确率上显著优于强基线模型，能够有效识别细微情感，并展现出鲁棒性能。可视化分析显示AGFN通过减少特征位置与预测误差之间的相关性，增强了泛化能力。

Conclusion: AGFN通过自适应门控融合机制有效提升了多模态情感分析的性能，特别是在处理模态质量变化和识别细微情感方面表现出色，同时增强了模型的泛化能力和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Multimodal sentiment analysis (MSA) leverages information fusion from diverse
modalities (e.g., text, audio, visual) to enhance sentiment prediction.
However, simple fusion techniques often fail to account for variations in
modality quality, such as those that are noisy, missing, or semantically
conflicting. This oversight leads to suboptimal performance, especially in
discerning subtle emotional nuances. To mitigate this limitation, we introduce
a simple yet efficient \textbf{A}daptive \textbf{G}ated \textbf{F}usion
\textbf{N}etwork that adaptively adjusts feature weights via a dual gate fusion
mechanism based on information entropy and modality importance. This mechanism
mitigates the influence of noisy modalities and prioritizes informative cues
following unimodal encoding and cross-modal interaction. Experiments on
CMU-MOSI and CMU-MOSEI show that AGFN significantly outperforms strong
baselines in accuracy, effectively discerning subtle emotions with robust
performance. Visualization analysis of feature representations demonstrates
that AGFN enhances generalization by learning from a broader feature
distribution, achieved by reducing the correlation between feature location and
prediction error, thereby decreasing reliance on specific locations and
creating more robust multimodal feature representations.

*Juncheng Dong,Weibin Mo,Zhengling Qi,Cong Shi,Ethan X. Fang,Vahid Tarokh*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于悲观原则的离线数据驱动分类优化框架PASTA，在数据覆盖不足的情况下实现最优期望收益，并在多种选择模型下建立了有限样本遗憾界。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决分类优化问题中由于数据覆盖不足导致的挑战，传统方法需要所有可行分类的完整数据覆盖，这在组合优化中往往难以实现。

Method: 引入悲观分类优化(PASTA)框架，利用悲观原则，仅要求离线数据分布包含最优分类，而不需要所有可行分类的完整覆盖。

Result: 为多项logit和嵌套logit等广泛使用的选择模型建立了首个有限样本遗憾界，证明了PASTA在样本和模型复杂度方面的极小极大最优性。

Conclusion: PASTA框架在数据覆盖不足的情况下有效解决了离线分类优化问题，数值实验表明其性能优于现有基线方法。

Abstract: We study a broad class of assortment optimization problems in an offline and
data-driven setting. In such problems, a firm lacks prior knowledge of the
underlying choice model, and aims to determine an optimal assortment based on
historical customer choice data. The combinatorial nature of assortment
optimization often results in insufficient data coverage, posing a significant
challenge in designing provably effective solutions. To address this, we
introduce a novel Pessimistic Assortment Optimization (PASTA) framework that
leverages the principle of pessimism to achieve optimal expected revenue under
general choice models. Notably, PASTA requires only that the offline data
distribution contains an optimal assortment, rather than providing the full
coverage of all feasible assortments. Theoretically, we establish the first
finite-sample regret bounds for offline assortment optimization across several
widely used choice models, including the multinomial logit and nested logit
models. Additionally, we derive a minimax regret lower bound, proving that
PASTA is minimax optimal in terms of sample and model complexity. Numerical
experiments further demonstrate that our method outperforms existing baseline
approaches.

### [83] [Representational Alignment Across Model Layers and Brain Regions with Hierarchical Optimal Transport](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01706)
*Shaan Shah,Meenakshi Khosla*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出分层最优传输(HOT)框架，通过全局优化实现神经网络表示的对齐，解决了传统方法在深度不匹配网络中的局限性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统表示相似性方法存在不对称结果、缺乏全局对齐分数、难以处理不同深度网络的问题，因为它们忽略了全局激活结构并限制为一对一层对应

Method: HOT联合推断软性、全局一致的层到层耦合和神经元级传输计划，允许源神经元在多个目标层间分布质量，在边际约束下最小化总传输成本

Result: 在视觉模型、大语言模型和人类视觉皮层记录中，HOT在比对质量上匹配或超越标准成对匹配方法，并揭示了平滑、细粒度的分层对应关系

Conclusion: HOT能够实现更丰富、更可解释的表示比较，特别是在网络架构或深度不同的情况下

Abstract: Standard representational similarity methods align each layer of a network to
its best match in another independently, producing asymmetric results, lacking
a global alignment score, and struggling with networks of different depths.
These limitations arise from ignoring global activation structure and
restricting mappings to rigid one-to-one layer correspondences. We propose
Hierarchical Optimal Transport (HOT), a unified framework that jointly infers
soft, globally consistent layer-to-layer couplings and neuron-level transport
plans. HOT allows source neurons to distribute mass across multiple target
layers while minimizing total transport cost under marginal constraints. This
yields both a single alignment score for the entire network comparison and a
soft transport plan that naturally handles depth mismatches through mass
distribution. We evaluate HOT on vision models, large language models, and
human visual cortex recordings. Across all domains, HOT matches or surpasses
standard pairwise matching in alignment quality. Moreover, it reveals smooth,
fine-grained hierarchical correspondences: early layers map to early layers,
deeper layers maintain relative positions, and depth mismatches are resolved by
distributing representations across multiple layers. These structured patterns
emerge naturally from global optimization without being imposed, yet are absent
in greedy layer-wise methods. HOT thus enables richer, more interpretable
comparisons between representations, particularly when networks differ in
architecture or depth.

*Aidan Acquah,Shing Chan,Aiden Doherty*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ActiNet模型（自监督ResNet-V2 + 隐马尔可夫模型）在手腕加速度计数据上识别活动强度，性能优于基线随机森林+HMM方法，F1分数0.82 vs 0.77。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在大规模流行病学研究中，需要可靠准确的人类活动识别模型来分析手腕加速度计数据，以研究体力活动与健康结果的关系。

Method: 使用151名CAPTURE-24参与者的数据，训练ActiNet模型（18层自监督改进ResNet-V2），然后进行隐马尔可夫模型平滑，通过5折分层组交叉验证评估性能。

Result: ActiNet模型平均宏观F1分数0.82，Cohen's kappa分数0.86，优于RF+HMM的0.77和0.81，在不同年龄和性别亚组中表现一致。

Conclusion: 研究结果支持在未来的流行病学研究中使用ActiNet从手腕加速度计数据中提取活动强度标签。

Abstract: The use of reliable and accurate human activity recognition (HAR) models on
passively collected wrist-accelerometer data is essential in large-scale
epidemiological studies that investigate the association between physical
activity and health outcomes. While the use of self-supervised learning has
generated considerable excitement in improving HAR, it remains unknown the
extent to which these models, coupled with hidden Markov models (HMMs), would
make a tangible improvement to classification performance, and the effect this
may have on the predicted daily activity intensity compositions. Using 151
CAPTURE-24 participants' data, we trained the ActiNet model, a self-supervised,
18-layer, modified ResNet-V2 model, followed by hidden Markov model (HMM)
smoothing to classify labels of activity intensity. The performance of this
model, evaluated using 5-fold stratified group cross-validation, was then
compared to a baseline random forest (RF) + HMM, established in existing
literature. Differences in performance and classification outputs were compared
with different subgroups of age and sex within the Capture-24 population. The
ActiNet model was able to distinguish labels of activity intensity with a mean
macro F1 score of 0.82, and mean Cohen's kappa score of 0.86. This exceeded the
performance of the RF + HMM, trained and validated on the same dataset, with
mean scores of 0.77 and 0.81, respectively. These findings were consistent
across subgroups of age and sex. These findings encourage the use of ActiNet
for the extraction of activity intensity labels from wrist-accelerometer data
in future epidemiological studies.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于无人机的联邦多模态学习框架，通过联合优化无人机感知调度、功率控制、轨迹规划、资源分配和基站资源管理来最小化系统延迟，并提供收敛性分析。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 利用无人机进行多模态感知可以克服单模态系统的限制，提高模型准确性、泛化能力，并提供更全面的环境理解。主要目标是优化无人机网络中联邦多模态学习系统的延迟。

Method: 提出了一种结合块坐标下降和逐次凸逼近技术的高效迭代优化算法，解决了延迟最小化问题的计算复杂性，并提供高质量近似解。

Result: 数值实验表明，该联邦多模态学习框架在不同数据设置下，在系统延迟和模型训练性能方面优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该研究成功开发了一个无人机辅助的联邦多模态学习框架，通过联合优化多个参数实现了系统延迟的最小化，并提供了理论收敛分析，验证了方法的有效性。

Abstract: This paper investigates federated multimodal learning (FML) assisted by
unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) with a focus on minimizing system latency and
providing convergence analysis. In this framework, UAVs are distributed
throughout the network to collect data, participate in model training, and
collaborate with a base station (BS) to build a global model. By utilizing
multimodal sensing, the UAVs overcome the limitations of unimodal systems,
enhancing model accuracy, generalization, and offering a more comprehensive
understanding of the environment. The primary objective is to optimize FML
system latency in UAV networks by jointly addressing UAV sensing scheduling,
power control, trajectory planning, resource allocation, and BS resource
management. To address the computational complexity of our latency minimization
problem, we propose an efficient iterative optimization algorithm combining
block coordinate descent and successive convex approximation techniques, which
provides high-quality approximate solutions. We also present a theoretical
convergence analysis for the UAV-assisted FML framework under a non-convex loss
function. Numerical experiments demonstrate that our FML framework outperforms
existing approaches in terms of system latency and model training performance
under different data settings.

*Jialin Zhao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: BD Attention (BDA) 是基于基分解的注意力无损算法重构，通过矩阵恒等式将多头投影重构为紧凑形式，在保持精确输出的同时实现数学保证的加速。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 注意力是大语言模型和视觉语言模型的核心操作，现有优化如FlashAttention主要关注I/O层面的系统优化，缺乏数学保证的无损加速方法。

Method: 利用基分解的矩阵恒等式，将多头投影重构为紧凑形式，无需重新训练，仅需4秒离线准备即可应用。

Result: 在DeepSeek-V2-Lite模型上，BDA实现了32%更快的键值投影、25%更小的权重，端到端困惑度仅增加0.02%（FP16）或0.0004%（FP32），对模型性能影响可忽略。

Conclusion: BDA是首个理论精确的无损注意力加速方法，与现有工程级优化互补，为注意力机制提供了数学保证的加速方案。

Abstract: Attention is a core operation in large language models (LLMs) and
vision-language models (VLMs). We present BD Attention (BDA), the first
lossless algorithmic reformulation of attention. BDA is enabled by a simple
matrix identity from Basis Decomposition (BD), which restructures multi-head
projections into a compact form while preserving exact outputs. Unlike
I/O-aware system optimizations such as FlashAttention, BDA provides a
mathematically guaranteed acceleration that is architecture-agnostic. On
DeepSeek-V2-Lite (16B, FP16), BDA requires only 4s of offline preparation with
no retraining required and, on modern GPUs, achieves 32% faster key/value
projections and 25% smaller weights, while increasing end-to-end perplexity
(PPL) by just 0.02% (FP16) or 0.0004% (FP32), a negligible effect on model
performance. These results position BDA as the first theoretically exact method
for lossless attention acceleration that is complementary to existing
engineering-level optimizations. Our code is available at

### [87] [Finite-Time Bounds for Distributionally Robust TD Learning with Linear Function Approximation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01721)
*Saptarshi Mandal,Yashaswini Murthy,R. Srikant*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了首个使用线性函数逼近的鲁棒TD学习算法，解决了分布鲁棒强化学习中的模型不确定性，在总变差距离和Wasserstein距离不确定性集下实现了O(1/ε²)的样本复杂度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有鲁棒TD学习的收敛保证仅限于表格MDP或依赖于限制性折扣因子假设，无法满足函数逼近场景下的需求。

Method: 结合双时间尺度随机逼近更新和外循环目标网络更新，无需模型且不需要MDP的生成访问。

Result: 实现了ε-精确值估计的O(1/ε²)样本复杂度，填补了鲁棒RL算法经验成功与非鲁棒对应物理论保证之间的关键差距。

Conclusion: 该算法成功扩展了鲁棒TD学习至函数逼近场景，关键思想也可相对直接地扩展到鲁棒Q学习。

Abstract: Distributionally robust reinforcement learning (DRRL) focuses on designing
policies that achieve good performance under model uncertainties. In
particular, we are interested in maximizing the worst-case long-term discounted
reward, where the data for RL comes from a nominal model while the deployed
environment can deviate from the nominal model within a prescribed uncertainty
set. Existing convergence guarantees for robust temporal-difference (TD)
learning for policy evaluation are limited to tabular MDPs or are dependent on
restrictive discount-factor assumptions when function approximation is used. We
present the first robust TD learning with linear function approximation, where
robustness is measured with respect to the total-variation distance and
Wasserstein-l distance uncertainty set. Additionally, our algorithm is both
model-free and does not require generative access to the MDP. Our algorithm
combines a two-time-scale stochastic-approximation update with an outer-loop
target-network update. We establish an $\tilde{O}(1/\epsilon^2)$ sample
complexity to obtain an $\epsilon$-accurate value estimate. Our results close a
key gap between the empirical success of robust RL algorithms and the
non-asymptotic guarantees enjoyed by their non-robust counterparts. The key
ideas in the paper also extend in a relatively straightforward fashion to
robust Q-learning with function approximation.

*Tanay Rastogi,Anders Karlström*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于深度神经网络的工作地点选择模型，相比传统离散选择模型，DNN能更好地理解复杂决策模式并提供更优结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统离散选择模型在准确反映个体决策过程方面面临挑战，需要开发更精确的工作地点选择建模方法。

Method: 使用深度神经网络方法建模工作地点选择，并与传统离散选择模型进行比较分析。

Result: DNN在工作地点选择建模中显示出作为DCM稳健替代方案的显著潜力。DNN在某些方面优于DCM，但DCM在评估个体属性对工作距离影响时与数据更一致。DCM在短距离表现更优，而DNN在长距离与数据和DCM表现相当。

Conclusion: 选择工作地点选择分析模型时应基于具体应用需求，两种模型各有优势，需要根据实际情况进行选择。

Abstract: Discrete choice models (DCMs) have long been used to analyze workplace
location decisions, but they face challenges in accurately mirroring individual
decision-making processes. This paper presents a deep neural network (DNN)
method for modeling workplace location choices, which aims to better understand
complex decision patterns and provides better results than traditional discrete
choice models (DCMs). The study demonstrates that DNNs show significant
potential as a robust alternative to DCMs in this domain. While both models
effectively replicate the impact of job opportunities on workplace location
choices, the DNN outperforms the DCM in certain aspects. However, the DCM
better aligns with data when assessing the influence of individual attributes
on workplace distance. Notably, DCMs excel at shorter distances, while DNNs
perform comparably to both data and DCMs for longer distances. These findings
underscore the importance of selecting the appropriate model based on specific
application requirements in workplace location choice analysis.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究DPSGD对神经网络公平性的影响，验证直接优化差分隐私模型超参数是否能改善公平性，以及分析不同性能指标上的不均衡影响。

Method: 1) 比较DPSGD在不同性能指标上的不均衡影响；2) 在广泛的超参数设置下进行分析；3) 扩展到DPSGD-Global-Adapt变体。

Result: 不同指标上的不均衡影响不一致；直接优化超参数不能可靠缓解DPSGD的不均衡影响，但能改善效用-公平性权衡；超参数调优会带来额外隐私泄露；DPSGD-Global-Adapt对超参数选择不鲁棒。

Conclusion: 需要仔细权衡隐私、效用和公平性；直接优化超参数能改善效用-公平性权衡但无法可靠解决不均衡影响；DPSGD-Global-Adapt不是稳健解决方案。

Abstract: Differential privacy (DP) is a prominent method for protecting information
about individuals during data analysis. Training neural networks with
differentially private stochastic gradient descent (DPSGD) influences the
model's learning dynamics and, consequently, its output. This can affect the
model's performance and fairness. While the majority of studies on the topic
report a negative impact on fairness, it has recently been suggested that
fairness levels comparable to non-private models can be achieved by optimizing
hyperparameters for performance directly on differentially private models
(rather than re-using hyperparameters from non-private models, as is common
practice). In this work, we analyze the generalizability of this claim by 1)
comparing the disparate impact of DPSGD on different performance metrics, and
2) analyzing it over a wide range of hyperparameter settings. We highlight that
a disparate impact on one metric does not necessarily imply a disparate impact
on another. Most importantly, we show that while optimizing hyperparameters
directly on differentially private models does not mitigate the disparate
impact of DPSGD reliably, it can still lead to improved utility-fairness
trade-offs compared to re-using hyperparameters from non-private models. We
stress, however, that any form of hyperparameter tuning entails additional
privacy leakage, calling for careful considerations of how to balance privacy,
utility and fairness. Finally, we extend our analyses to DPSGD-Global-Adapt, a
variant of DPSGD designed to mitigate the disparate impact on accuracy, and
conclude that this alternative may not be a robust solution with respect to
hyperparameter choice.

TL;DR: 提出了一种无监督动态特征选择方法，用于增强视觉任务中的潜在表示，通过移除误导性或冗余信息来提高模型性能和泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉任务中的潜在表示常受到噪声或无关特征的影响，这会降低模型性能和泛化能力，需要一种方法来识别和移除这些有害信息。

Method: 使用无监督动态特征选择方法，针对每个实例识别并移除图像中的误导性或冗余信息，仅保留最相关特征贡献于潜在空间。

Result: 在图像数据集上的实验表明，配备无监督DFS的模型在各种任务中实现了显著的泛化性能提升，包括聚类和图像生成，计算成本增加最小。

Conclusion: 无监督动态特征选择方法能有效增强潜在表示，提高模型性能，且不依赖标注数据，具有广泛适用性。

Abstract: Latent representations are critical for the performance and robustness of
machine learning models, as they encode the essential features of data in a
compact and informative manner. However, in vision tasks, these representations
are often affected by noisy or irrelevant features, which can degrade the
model's performance and generalization capabilities. This paper presents a
novel approach for enhancing latent representations using unsupervised Dynamic
Feature Selection (DFS). For each instance, the proposed method identifies and
removes misleading or redundant information in images, ensuring that only the
most relevant features contribute to the latent space. By leveraging an
unsupervised framework, our approach avoids reliance on labeled data, making it
broadly applicable across various domains and datasets. Experiments conducted
on image datasets demonstrate that models equipped with unsupervised DFS
achieve significant improvements in generalization performance across various
tasks, including clustering and image generation, while incurring a minimal
increase in the computational cost.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) research requires diverse, challenging
environments that are both tractable and scalable. While modern video games may
offer rich dynamics, they are computationally expensive and poorly suited for
large-scale experimentation due to their CPU-bound execution. We introduce
Octax, a high-performance suite of classic arcade game environments implemented
in JAX, based on CHIP-8 emulation, a predecessor to Atari, which is widely
adopted as a benchmark in RL research. Octax provides the JAX community with a
long-awaited end-to-end GPU alternative to the Atari benchmark, offering
image-based environments, spanning puzzle, action, and strategy genres, all
executable at massive scale on modern GPUs. Our JAX-based implementation
achieves orders-of-magnitude speedups over traditional CPU emulators while
maintaining perfect fidelity to the original game mechanics. We demonstrate
Octax's capabilities by training RL agents across multiple games, showing
significant improvements in training speed and scalability compared to existing
solutions. The environment's modular design enables researchers to easily
extend the suite with new games or generate novel environments using large
language models, making it an ideal platform for large-scale RL
experimentation.

Conclusion: 提出的两种训练策略能够有效解决学习非正则哈密顿动力学时的数值不稳定问题，使长期模拟成为可能。

Abstract: This work focuses on learning non-canonical Hamiltonian dynamics from data,
where long-term predictions require the preservation of structure both in the
learned model and in numerical schemes. Previous research focused on either
facet, respectively with a potential-based architecture and with degenerate
variational integrators, but new issues arise when combining both. In
experiments, the learnt model is sometimes numerically unstable due to the
gauge dependency of the scheme, rendering long-time simulations impossible. In
this paper, we identify this problem and propose two different training
strategies to address it, either by directly learning the vector field or by
learning a time-discrete dynamics through the scheme. Several numerical test
cases assess the ability of the methods to learn complex physical dynamics,
like the guiding center from gyrokinetic plasma physics.

Conclusion: 后处理过滤方法存在关键限制，可能提供虚假的安全感而无法有效保护患者隐私，需要过滤器设计的重大改进才能用于敏感应用。

Abstract: The generation of privacy-preserving synthetic datasets is a promising avenue
for overcoming data scarcity in medical AI research. Post-hoc privacy filtering
techniques, designed to remove samples containing personally identifiable
information, have recently been proposed as a solution. However, their
effectiveness remains largely unverified. This work presents a rigorous
evaluation of a filtering pipeline applied to chest X-ray synthesis. Contrary
to claims from the original publications, our results demonstrate that current
filters exhibit limited specificity and consistency, achieving high sensitivity
only for real images while failing to reliably detect near-duplicates generated
from training data. These results demonstrate a critical limitation of post-hoc
filtering: rather than effectively safeguarding patient privacy, these methods
may provide a false sense of security while leaving unacceptable levels of
patient information exposed. We conclude that substantial advances in filter
design are needed before these methods can be confidently deployed in sensitive
applications.

Result: 沙漏架构在生成任务上始终优于传统设计，随着参数预算增加，最优沙漏配置倾向于更深的网络、更宽的跳跃连接和更窄的瓶颈，这与传统MLP的缩放模式不同。

Conclusion: 研究结果表明需要重新考虑现代架构中跳跃连接的放置方式，这种设计理念可能扩展到Transformer和其他残差网络。

Abstract: Multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) conventionally follow a narrow-wide-narrow
design where skip connections operate at the input/output dimensions while
processing occurs in expanded hidden spaces. We challenge this convention by
proposing wide-narrow-wide (Hourglass) MLP blocks where skip connections
operate at expanded dimensions while residual computation flows through narrow
bottlenecks. This inversion leverages higher-dimensional spaces for incremental
refinement while maintaining computational efficiency through parameter-matched
designs. Implementing Hourglass MLPs requires an initial projection to lift
input signals to expanded dimensions. We propose that this projection can
remain fixed at random initialization throughout training, enabling efficient
training and inference implementations. We evaluate both architectures on
generative tasks over popular image datasets, characterizing
performance-parameter Pareto frontiers through systematic architectural search.
Results show that Hourglass architectures consistently achieve superior Pareto
frontiers compared to conventional designs. As parameter budgets increase,
optimal Hourglass configurations favor deeper networks with wider skip
connections and narrower bottlenecks-a scaling pattern distinct from
conventional MLPs. Our findings suggest reconsidering skip connection placement
in modern architectures, with potential applications extending to Transformers
and other residual networks.

*Adam Filipek*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出Sparse Query Attention (SQA)架构，通过减少查询头数量来降低注意力机制的计算复杂度，在长序列处理中实现高达3倍的吞吐量提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统多头注意力机制存在二次计算复杂度问题，现有解决方案如MQA和GQA虽然解决了内存带宽瓶颈，但未减少注意力得分计算所需的FLOPs。

Method: SQA通过减少查询头数量来直接降低注意力机制的计算复杂度，提出理论基础和数学公式，以及一系列架构变体。

Result: 在32k-200k长序列基准测试中，SQA在模型预训练、微调和编码器任务等计算受限场景下实现高达3倍的吞吐量提升，且对模型质量影响极小。

Conclusion: SQA是一种有效的注意力优化方法，可作为构建更高效和可扩展模型的强大工具，在Reactive Transformer架构开发过程中偶然发现。

Abstract: The Transformer architecture, underpinned by the Multi-Head Attention (MHA)
mechanism, has become the de facto standard for state-of-the-art models in
artificial intelligence. However, the quadratic computational complexity of MHA
with respect to sequence length presents a significant barrier to scaling,
particularly for applications involving long contexts. Prevailing solutions,
such as Multi-Query Attention (MQA) and Grouped-Query Attention (GQA), have
effectively addressed the memory bandwidth bottleneck that dominates
autoregressive inference latency by sharing Key and Value projections. While
highly successful, these methods do not reduce the fundamental number of
floating-point operations (FLOPs) required for the attention score computation,
which remains a critical bottleneck for training and full-sequence processing.
This paper introduces Sparse Query Attention (SQA), a novel attention
architecture that pursues an alternative and complementary optimization path.
Instead of reducing Key/Value heads, SQA reduces the number of Query heads.
This architectural modification directly decreases the computational complexity
of the attention mechanism by a factor proportional to the reduction in query
heads, thereby lowering the overall FLOPs. This work presents the theoretical
foundation of SQA, its mathematical formulation, and a family of architectural
variants. Empirical benchmarks on long sequences (32k-200k tokens) demonstrate
that SQA can achieve significant throughput improvements of up to 3x in
computation-bound scenarios such as model pre-training, fine-tuning, and
encoder-based tasks, with only a minimal impact on model quality in preliminary
smallscale experiments. SQA was discovered serendipitously during the
development of the upcoming Reactive Transformer architecture, suggesting its
potential as a powerful tool for building more efficient and scalable models

TL;DR: 提出了一种顺序不变强化学习框架用于黑盒组合优化，通过随机生成顺序训练自回归生成模型，提高样本效率和搜索多样性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统分布估计算法依赖学习显式变量依赖图，成本高且难以有效捕捉复杂交互。需要一种更高效的组合优化方法。

Method: 使用多变量自回归生成模型，在训练时随机采样生成顺序（信息保留dropout），使模型对变量顺序不变，并采用GRPO进行稳定的策略梯度更新。

Result: 在多种基准算法和不同规模问题实例上，该方法经常获得最佳性能，并始终避免灾难性失败。

Conclusion: 顺序不变强化学习框架在组合优化中表现出色，通过促进搜索空间多样性和关注相关变量依赖，提高了样本效率和性能稳定性。

Abstract: We introduce an order-invariant reinforcement learning framework for
black-box combinatorial optimization. Classical estimation-of-distribution
algorithms (EDAs) often rely on learning explicit variable dependency graphs,
which can be costly and fail to capture complex interactions efficiently. In
contrast, we parameterize a multivariate autoregressive generative model
trained without a fixed variable ordering. By sampling random generation orders
during training - a form of information-preserving dropout - the model is
encouraged to be invariant to variable order, promoting search-space diversity
and shaping the model to focus on the most relevant variable dependencies,
improving sample efficiency. We adapt Generalized Reinforcement Policy
Optimization (GRPO) to this setting, providing stable policy-gradient updates
from scale-invariant advantages. Across a wide range of benchmark algorithms
and problem instances of varying sizes, our method frequently achieves the best
performance and consistently avoids catastrophic failures.

Conclusion: 该方法为AutoML工作流程提供了重要转变，通过预选模型选择显著降低了计算需求，同时保持了模型选择的性能。

Abstract: The field of AutoML has made remarkable progress in post-hoc model selection,
with libraries capable of automatically identifying the most performing models
for a given dataset. Nevertheless, these methods often rely on exhaustive
hyperparameter searches, where methods automatically train and test different
types of models on the target dataset. Contrastingly, pre-hoc prediction
emerges as a promising alternative, capable of bypassing exhaustive search
through intelligent pre-selection of models. Despite its potential, pre-hoc
prediction remains under-explored in the literature. This paper explores the
intersection of AutoML and pre-hoc model selection by leveraging traditional
models and Large Language Model (LLM) agents to reduce the search space of
AutoML libraries. By relying on dataset descriptions and statistical
information, we reduce the AutoML search space. Our methodology is applied to
the AWS AutoGluon portfolio dataset, a state-of-the-art AutoML benchmark
containing 175 tabular classification datasets available on OpenML. The
proposed approach offers a shift in AutoML workflows, significantly reducing
computational overhead, while still selecting the best model for the given
dataset.

Conclusion: 模型检查可以作为形式语言表示学习的目标，学习到的表示能有效迁移到下游任务并泛化到更复杂的公式。

Abstract: Model checking is a key technique for verifying safety-critical systems
against formal specifications, where recent applications of deep learning have
shown promise. However, while ubiquitous for vision and language domains,
representation learning remains underexplored in formal verification. We
introduce Contrastive Neural Model Checking (CNML), a novel method that
leverages the model checking task as a guiding signal for learning aligned
representations. CNML jointly embeds logical specifications and systems into a
shared latent space through a self-supervised contrastive objective. On
industry-inspired retrieval tasks, CNML considerably outperforms both
algorithmic and neural baselines in cross-modal and intra-modal settings.We
further show that the learned representations effectively transfer to
downstream tasks and generalize to more complex formulas. These findings
demonstrate that model checking can serve as an objective for learning
representations for formal languages.

Motivation: 对称性在等变网络设计和控制方程发现中广泛应用，但在复杂场景中通常未知。现有方法大多局限于线性对称性，非线性对称性发现方法无法显式获得李代数子空间。

Method: 指定无穷小群作用的函数库，求解其系数矩阵。证明微分方程的延拓公式对系数矩阵也是线性的，通过数据中心差分和神经网络雅可比矩阵代入无穷小准则，得到系数矩阵的线性方程组，使用SVD求解。

Conclusion: LieNLSD成功解决了非线性对称性发现中无法显式获得李代数子空间的问题，为复杂系统中的对称性分析提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Symmetry is widely applied in problems such as the design of equivariant
networks and the discovery of governing equations, but in complex scenarios, it
is not known in advance. Most previous symmetry discovery methods are limited
to linear symmetries, and recent attempts to discover nonlinear symmetries fail
to explicitly get the Lie algebra subspace. In this paper, we propose LieNLSD,
which is, to our knowledge, the first method capable of determining the number
of infinitesimal generators with nonlinear terms and their explicit
expressions. We specify a function library for the infinitesimal group action
and aim to solve for its coefficient matrix, proving that its prolongation
formula for differential equations, which governs dynamic data, is also linear
with respect to the coefficient matrix. By substituting the central differences
of the data and the Jacobian matrix of the trained neural network into the
infinitesimal criterion, we get a system of linear equations for the
coefficient matrix, which can then be solved using SVD. On top quark tagging
and a series of dynamic systems, LieNLSD shows qualitative advantages over
existing methods and improves the long rollout accuracy of neural PDE solvers
by over 20% while applying to guide data augmentation. Code and data are
available at https://github.com/hulx2002/LieNLSD.

Result: 模型成功恢复了规则学习和运动学习任务中的真实组件和统计信息，能够从单个示例快速推断新解决方案

Conclusion: 该框架结合了神经网络的表达能力和概率推理的数据效率，实现了快速的组合式元学习

Abstract: To solve a new task from minimal experience, it is essential to effectively
reuse knowledge from previous tasks, a problem known as meta-learning.
Compositional solutions, where common elements of computation are flexibly
recombined into new configurations, are particularly well-suited for
meta-learning. Here, we propose a compositional meta-learning model that
explicitly represents tasks as structured combinations of reusable
computations. We achieve this by learning a generative model that captures the
underlying components and their statistics shared across a family of tasks.
This approach transforms learning a new task into a probabilistic inference
problem, which allows for finding solutions without parameter updates through
highly constrained hypothesis testing. Our model successfully recovers ground
truth components and statistics in rule learning and motor learning tasks. We
then demonstrate its ability to quickly infer new solutions from just single
examples. Together, our framework joins the expressivity of neural networks
with the data-efficiency of probabilistic inference to achieve rapid
compositional meta-learning.

constraint functions are chosen arbitrarily by an adversary, and the constraint
functions need not contain any common feasible point. The results are
established by reducing the constrained learning problem to an instance of the
standard OCO problem with specially constructed surrogate cost functions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型训练常受极端内存需求限制，其中优化器状态占主导地位。现有方法通过将梯度投影到低维子空间来缓解这一成本，但需要更深入地理解梯度空间动态特性。

Method: 引入GrassWalk和GrassJump随机算法，利用子空间特性，通过分析梯度空间及其子空间的动态特性来设计更有效的优化策略。

Result: 在LLaMA-1B和LLaMA-7B预训练中实现了最先进的内存节省，同时提升了性能表现。

Conclusion: 梯度空间具有近平坦曲率特性，需要明确考虑这种几何特性的算法。基于子空间分析的随机算法能够有效解决内存瓶颈问题。

Abstract: Training large language models (LLMs) is often bottlenecked by extreme memory
demands, with optimizer states dominating the footprint. Recent works mitigates
this cost by projecting gradients into low-dimensional subspaces using
sophisticated update strategies. In this paper, we analyze the dynamics of
gradient space and its underlying subspaces. We find that while a small
subspace captures most gradient energy, a significant portion still resides in
the residual bulk; moreover, the influence of the core subspace diminishes over
time and in deeper layers. We also observe that the gradient space exhibits
near-flat curvature, calling for algorithms that explicitly account for this
geometry. Motivated by these insights, we introduce a suite of randomized
algorithms, GrassWalk and GrassJump, which exploit subspace and achieve
state-of-the-art memory savings while improving performance on LLaMA-1B and
LLaMA-7B pretraining.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 许多自然动态过程（如细胞分化、疾病进展）只能通过静态样本快照观察，重建其时间演化对科学研究至关重要。现有方法在高维情况下可扩展性差且需要严格假设。

Method: 扩展了Diffusion Schrödinger Bridge Matching，推导出迭代马尔可夫拟合算法，以新颖的因子化方式处理多个边际。

Result: 在玩具示例上保留理论性质，在真实世界数据集（如100维转录组轨迹推断）上达到最先进性能，首次在超高维图像设置中恢复耦合和动态。

Conclusion: 多边际Schrödinger桥是重建静态数据中隐藏动态的实用且有原则的方法。

Abstract: Many natural dynamic processes -- such as in vivo cellular differentiation or
disease progression -- can only be observed through the lens of static sample
snapshots. While challenging, reconstructing their temporal evolution to
decipher underlying dynamic properties is of major interest to scientific
research. Existing approaches enable data transport along a temporal axis but
are poorly scalable in high dimension and require restrictive assumptions to be
met. To address these issues, we propose \textit{\textbf{Multi-Marginal
temporal Schr\"odinger Bridge Matching}} (\textbf{MMtSBM}) \textit{for video
generation from unpaired data}, extending the theoretical guarantees and
empirical efficiency of Diffusion Schr\"odinger Bridge Matching
(arXiv:archive/2303.16852) by deriving the Iterative Markovian Fitting
algorithm to multiple marginals in a novel factorized fashion. Experiments show
that MMtSBM retains theoretical properties on toy examples, achieves
state-of-the-art performance on real world datasets such as transcriptomic
trajectory inference in 100 dimensions, and for the first time recovers
couplings and dynamics in very high dimensional image settings. Our work
establishes multi-marginal Schr\"odinger bridges as a practical and principled
approach for recovering hidden dynamics from static data.

Abstract: Healthcare generates diverse streams of data, including electronic health
records (EHR), medical imaging, genetics, and ongoing monitoring from wearable
devices. Traditional diagnostic models frequently analyze these sources in
isolation, which constrains their capacity to identify cross-modal correlations
essential for early disease diagnosis. Our research presents a multimodal
foundation model that consolidates diverse patient data through an
attention-based transformer framework. At first, dedicated encoders put each
modality into a shared latent space. Then, they combine them using multi-head
attention and residual normalization. The architecture is made for pretraining
on many tasks, which makes it easy to adapt to new diseases and datasets with
little extra work. We provide an experimental strategy that uses benchmark
datasets in oncology, cardiology, and neurology, with the goal of testing early
detection tasks. The framework includes data governance and model management
tools in addition to technological performance to improve transparency,
reliability, and clinical interpretability. The suggested method works toward a
single foundation model for precision diagnostics, which could improve the
accuracy of predictions and help doctors make decisions.

Motivation: Tsetlin Machine作为一种基于有限状态自动机和命题逻辑的新型机器学习范式，比神经网络更具可解释性。本文旨在探索该架构在大规模多通道图像分类中的适用性。

Method: 提出了一种生成局部解释和全局类别表示的方法论。局部解释用于解释模型预测，全局类别表示聚合每个类别的重要模式。这些解释总结了卷积子句捕获的知识，可以可视化为图像。

Result: 在MNIST数据集上达到98.5%准确率，在CelebA数据集上达到86.56% F1分数（相比ResNet50的88.07%）。TM在保持可解释性的同时，性能与深度学习模型相当。

Conclusion: TM在复杂大规模训练环境中仍能保持竞争力，同时维持其可解释性优势。这有助于更好地理解TM子句，并为将该模型应用于更复杂多样的数据集提供了见解。

Abstract: The Tsetlin Machine (TM) is a novel machine learning paradigm that employs
finite-state automata for learning and utilizes propositional logic to
represent patterns. Due to its simplistic approach, TMs are inherently more
interpretable than learning algorithms based on Neural Networks. The
Convolutional TM has shown comparable performance on various datasets such as
MNIST, K-MNIST, F-MNIST and CIFAR-2. In this paper, we explore the
applicability of the TM architecture for large-scale multi-channel (RGB) image
classification. We propose a methodology to generate both local interpretations
and global class representations. The local interpretations can be used to
explain the model predictions while the global class representations aggregate
important patterns for each class. These interpretations summarize the
knowledge captured by the convolutional clauses, which can be visualized as
images. We evaluate our methods on MNIST and CelebA datasets, using models that
achieve 98.5\% accuracy on MNIST and 86.56\% F1-score on CelebA (compared to
88.07\% for ResNet50) respectively. We show that the TM performs competitively
to this deep learning model while maintaining its interpretability, even in
large-scale complex training environments. This contributes to a better
understanding of TM clauses and provides insights into how these models can be
applied to more complex and diverse datasets.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了RoGRAD框架，通过检索增强的对比精炼来解决图神经网络在存在复合缺陷时的性能下降问题，相比传统GNN和LLM增强方法有显著改进。

Motivation: 现实世界中的图数据存在多种缺陷，严重影响GNN性能。现有研究缺乏对图原生方法和LLM增强方法在复合缺陷下表现的全面比较，且LLM增强方法是否始终优于传统方法尚不明确。

Method: 提出了RoGRAD框架，这是首个迭代式检索增强生成范式，通过RAG注入基于检索的增强，提供类别一致且多样化的增强，并通过迭代图对比学习强制区分性表示，将LLM增强从静态信号注入转变为动态精炼。

Result: 大量实验证明RoGRAD优于传统GNN和LLM增强基线，平均改进高达82.43%，揭示了被忽视的脆弱性并挑战了LLM增强始终优越的假设。

Conclusion: RoGRAD框架通过动态迭代精炼有效解决了图数据复合缺陷问题，为图神经网络在真实场景中的应用提供了更稳健的解决方案。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are widely adopted in Web-related applications,
serving as a core technique for learning from graph-structured data, such as
text-attributed graphs. Yet in real-world scenarios, such graphs exhibit
deficiencies that substantially undermine GNN performance. While prior
GNN-based augmentation studies have explored robustness against individual
imperfections, a systematic understanding of how graph-native and Large
Language Models (LLMs) enhanced methods behave under compound deficiencies is
still missing. Specifically, there has been no comprehensive investigation
comparing conventional approaches and recent LLM-on-graph frameworks, leaving
their merits unclear. To fill this gap, we conduct the first empirical study
that benchmarks these two lines of methods across diverse graph deficiencies,
revealing overlooked vulnerabilities and challenging the assumption that LLM
augmentation is consistently superior. Building on empirical findings, we
propose Robust Graph Learning via Retrieval-Augmented Contrastive Refinement
(RoGRAD) framework. Unlike prior one-shot LLM-as-Enhancer designs, RoGRAD is
the first iterative paradigm that leverages Retrieval-Augmented Generation
(RAG) to inject retrieval-grounded augmentations by supplying class-consistent,
diverse augmentations and enforcing discriminative representations through
iterative graph contrastive learning. It transforms LLM augmentation for graphs
from static signal injection into dynamic refinement. Extensive experiments
demonstrate RoGRAD's superiority over both conventional GNN- and LLM-enhanced
baselines, achieving up to 82.43% average improvement.

Motivation: LoRA在性能上仍落后于全参数微调，部分原因是未能充分利用低秩流形的几何结构。

Method: 采用三因子分解U·S·V⊤，约束U和V在Stiefel流形上保持正交性，使用几何优化设计将欧几里得优化器转换为黎曼优化器。

Result: 在常识推理、数学和代码生成、图像分类和图像生成等广泛下游任务中，性能优于最新的LoRA变体。

Conclusion: 提出的几何感知LoRA扩展方法在保持与现有微调流程兼容的同时，实现了更优的性能。

Abstract: Low-rank adaptation (LoRA) has been widely adopted as a parameter-efficient
technique for fine-tuning large-scale pre-trained models. However, it still
lags behind full fine-tuning in performance, partly due to its insufficient
exploitation of the geometric structure underlying low-rank manifolds. In this
paper, we propose a geometry-aware extension of LoRA that uses a three-factor
decomposition $U\!SV^\top$. Analogous to the structure of singular value
decomposition (SVD), it separates the adapter's input and output subspaces, $V$
and $U$, from the scaling factor $S$. Our method constrains $U$ and $V$ to lie
on the Stiefel manifold, ensuring their orthonormality throughout the training.
To optimize on the Stiefel manifold, we employ a flexible and modular geometric
optimization design that converts any Euclidean optimizer to a Riemannian one.
It enables efficient subspace learning while remaining compatible with existing
fine-tuning pipelines. Empirical results across a wide range of downstream
tasks, including commonsense reasoning, math and code generation, image
classification, and image generation, demonstrate the superior performance of
our approach against the recent state-of-the-art variants of LoRA. Code is

explicit characterizations for important cases such as the cross-entropy loss,
loss functions with a power form, and the quadratic loss, extending in this way
available results for the 0-1 loss. These reformulations enable efficient
computation of sharp lower bounds for adversarial risks and facilitate the
design of robust classifiers beyond the 0-1 loss setting. Our paper uncovers
interesting connections between adversarial robustness, $\alpha$-fair packing
problems, and generalized barycenter problems for arbitrary positive measures
where Kullback-Leibler and Tsallis entropies are used as penalties. Our
theoretical results are accompanied with illustrative numerical experiments
where we obtain tighter lower bounds for adversarial risks with the
cross-entropy loss function.

TL;DR: 提出Moon框架，通过模态转换方法将多元时间序列异常检测问题转化为图像分类问题，结合多模态CNN和SHAP解释器，在效率、准确性和可解释性方面优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多元时间序列异常检测方法存在三个主要问题：无监督方法依赖误差阈值导致不准确；半监督方法未充分利用异常标签；监督方法难以捕捉局部关系、计算成本高且受限于标注数据稀缺。

Method: 1. 提出多元马尔可夫转移场(MV-MTF)将数值时间序列转换为图像表示；2. 使用多模态CNN融合数值和图像数据；3. 基于SHAP的异常解释器识别关键变量。

Result: 在6个真实世界MTS数据集上的实验表明，Moon在效率上提升高达93%，准确性提升4%，解释性能提升10.8%，优于6种最先进方法。

Conclusion: Moon框架通过模态转换和多模态融合有效解决了现有MTS异常检测方法的局限性，在效率、准确性和可解释性方面均有显著提升。

Abstract: Multivariate time series (MTS) anomaly detection identifies abnormal patterns
where each timestamp contains multiple variables. Existing MTS anomaly
detection methods fall into three categories: reconstruction-based,
prediction-based, and classifier-based methods. However, these methods face two
key challenges: (1) Unsupervised learning methods, such as reconstruction-based
and prediction-based methods, rely on error thresholds, which can lead to
inaccuracies; (2) Semi-supervised methods mainly model normal data and often
underuse anomaly labels, limiting detection of subtle anomalies;(3) Supervised
learning methods, such as classifier-based approaches, often fail to capture
local relationships, incur high computational costs, and are constrained by the
scarcity of labeled data. To address these limitations, we propose Moon, a
supervised modality conversion-based multivariate time series anomaly detection
framework. Moon enhances the efficiency and accuracy of anomaly detection while
providing detailed anomaly analysis reports. First, Moon introduces a novel
multivariate Markov Transition Field (MV-MTF) technique to convert numeric time
series data into image representations, capturing relationships across
variables and timestamps. Since numeric data retains unique patterns that
cannot be fully captured by image conversion alone, Moon employs a
Multimodal-CNN to integrate numeric and image data through a feature fusion
model with parameter sharing, enhancing training efficiency. Finally, a
SHAP-based anomaly explainer identifies key variables contributing to
anomalies, improving interpretability. Extensive experiments on six real-world
MTS datasets demonstrate that Moon outperforms six state-of-the-art methods by
up to 93% in efficiency, 4% in accuracy and, 10.8% in interpretation
performance.

Abstract: The integration of online reinforcement learning (RL) into diffusion and flow
models has recently emerged as a promising approach for aligning generative
models with human preferences. Stochastic sampling via Stochastic Differential
Equations (SDE) is employed during the denoising process to generate diverse
denoising directions for RL exploration. While existing methods effectively
explore potential high-value samples, they suffer from sub-optimal preference
alignment due to sparse and narrow reward signals. To address these challenges,
we propose a novel Granular-GRPO ($\text{G}^2$RPO ) framework that achieves
precise and comprehensive reward assessments of sampling directions in
reinforcement learning of flow models. Specifically, a Singular Stochastic
Sampling strategy is introduced to support step-wise stochastic exploration
while enforcing a high correlation between the reward and the injected noise,
thereby facilitating a faithful reward for each SDE perturbation. Concurrently,
to eliminate the bias inherent in fixed-granularity denoising, we introduce a
Multi-Granularity Advantage Integration module that aggregates advantages
computed at multiple diffusion scales, producing a more comprehensive and
robust evaluation of the sampling directions. Experiments conducted on various
reward models, including both in-domain and out-of-domain evaluations,
demonstrate that our $\text{G}^2$RPO significantly outperforms existing
flow-based GRPO baselines,highlighting its effectiveness and robustness.

Abstract: Calibrating machine learning models so that predicted probabilities better
reflect the true outcome frequencies is crucial for reliable decision-making
across many applications. In Federated Learning (FL), the goal is to train a
global model on data which is distributed across multiple clients and cannot be
centralized due to privacy concerns. FL is applied in key areas such as
healthcare and finance where calibration is strongly required, yet federated
private calibration has been largely overlooked. This work introduces the
integration of post-hoc model calibration techniques within FL. Specifically,
we transfer traditional centralized calibration methods such as histogram
binning and temperature scaling into federated environments and define new
methods to operate them under strong client heterogeneity. We study (1) a
federated setting and (2) a user-level Differential Privacy (DP) setting and
demonstrate how both federation and DP impacts calibration accuracy. We propose
strategies to mitigate degradation commonly observed under heterogeneity and
our findings highlight that our federated temperature scaling works best for
DP-FL whereas our weighted binning approach is best when DP is not required.

Conclusion: 几何感知的探索为抗菌肽设计提供了强大的新范式。

Abstract: Antimicrobial peptide discovery is challenged by the astronomical size of
peptide space and the relative scarcity of active peptides. Generative models
provide continuous latent "maps" of peptide space, but conventionally ignore
decoder-induced geometry and rely on flat Euclidean metrics, rendering
exploration and optimization distorted and inefficient. Prior manifold-based
remedies assume fixed intrinsic dimensionality, which critically fails in
practice for peptide data. Here, we introduce PepCompass, a geometry-aware
framework for peptide exploration and optimization. At its core, we define a
Union of $\kappa$-Stable Riemannian Manifolds $\mathbb{M}^{\kappa}$, a family
of decoder-induced manifolds that captures local geometry while ensuring
computational stability. We propose two local exploration methods: Second-Order
Riemannian Brownian Efficient Sampling, which provides a convergent
second-order approximation to Riemannian Brownian motion, and Mutation
Enumeration in Tangent Space, which reinterprets tangent directions as discrete
amino-acid substitutions. Combining these yields Local Enumeration Bayesian
Optimization (LE-BO), an efficient algorithm for local activity optimization.
Finally, we introduce Potential-minimizing Geodesic Search (PoGS), which
interpolates between prototype embeddings along property-enriched geodesics,
biasing discovery toward seeds, i.e. peptides with favorable activity. In-vitro
validation confirms the effectiveness of PepCompass: PoGS yields four novel
seeds, and subsequent optimization with LE-BO discovers 25 highly active
peptides with broad-spectrum activity, including against resistant bacterial
strains. These results demonstrate that geometry-informed exploration provides
a powerful new paradigm for antimicrobial peptide design.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出GraphNC框架，通过教师模型的异常分数分布对齐和扰动正则化来校准图异常检测中的正态性，解决现有半监督方法过拟合标注正常节点的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有半监督图异常检测方法仅基于标注的正常节点学习正态性，容易过拟合给定模式，导致高误检率。需要利用未标注数据来校准正态性。

Method: GraphNC包含两个组件：异常分数分布对齐(ScoreDA)通过对齐教师模型的分数分布来优化异常分数；扰动正态正则化(NormReg)通过最小化标注节点上的扰动一致性损失来使正常节点表示更紧凑。

Result: ScoreDA将正常和异常类别的异常分数推向两端，产生更可分离的异常分数；NormReg缓解教师模型不准确分数的误导影响。

Conclusion: GraphNC框架通过联合利用标注和未标注数据，在异常分数和节点表示空间中校准正态性，有效提升图异常检测性能。

Abstract: Graph anomaly detection (GAD) has attracted growing interest for its crucial
ability to uncover irregular patterns in broad applications. Semi-supervised
GAD, which assumes a subset of annotated normal nodes available during
training, is among the most widely explored application settings. However, the
normality learned by existing semi-supervised GAD methods is limited to the
labeled normal nodes, often inclining to overfitting the given patterns. These
can lead to high detection errors, such as high false positives. To overcome
this limitation, we propose GraphNC , a graph normality calibration framework
that leverages both labeled and unlabeled data to calibrate the normality from
a teacher model (a pre-trained semi-supervised GAD model) jointly in anomaly
score and node representation spaces. GraphNC includes two main components,
anomaly score distribution alignment (ScoreDA) and perturbation-based normality
regularization (NormReg). ScoreDA optimizes the anomaly scores of our model by
aligning them with the score distribution yielded by the teacher model. Due to
accurate scores in most of the normal nodes and part of the anomaly nodes in
the teacher model, the score alignment effectively pulls the anomaly scores of
the normal and abnormal classes toward the two ends, resulting in more
separable anomaly scores. Nevertheless, there are inaccurate scores from the
teacher model. To mitigate the misleading by these scores, NormReg is designed
to regularize the graph normality in the representation space, making the
representations of normal nodes more compact by minimizing a
perturbation-guided consistency loss solely on the labeled nodes.

Abstract: As AI systems become more embedded in everyday life, the development of fair
and unbiased models becomes more critical. Considering the social impact of AI
systems is not merely a technical challenge but a moral imperative. As
evidenced in numerous research studies, learning fair and robust
representations has proven to be a powerful approach to effectively debiasing
algorithms and improving fairness while maintaining essential information for
prediction tasks. Representation learning frameworks, particularly those that
utilize self-supervised and contrastive learning, have demonstrated superior
robustness and generalizability across various domains. Despite the growing
interest in applying these approaches to tabular data, the issue of fairness in
these learned representations remains underexplored. In this study, we
introduce a contrastive learning framework specifically designed to address
bias and learn fair representations in tabular datasets. By strategically
selecting positive pair samples and employing supervised and self-supervised
contrastive learning, we significantly reduce bias compared to existing
state-of-the-art contrastive learning models for tabular data. Our results
demonstrate the efficacy of our approach in mitigating bias with minimum
trade-off in accuracy and leveraging the learned fair representations in
various downstream tasks.

Abstract: In deep learning, dense layer connectivity has become a key design principle
in deep neural networks (DNNs), enabling efficient information flow and strong
performance across a range of applications. In this work, we model densely
connected DNNs mathematically and analyze their learning problems in the
deep-layer limit. For a broad applicability, we present our analysis in a
framework setting of DNNs with densely connected layers and general non-local
feature transformations (with local feature transformations as special cases)
within layers, which is called dense non-local (DNL) framework and includes
standard DenseNets and variants as special examples. In this formulation, the
densely connected networks are modeled as nonlinear integral equations, in
contrast to the ordinary differential equation viewpoint commonly adopted in
prior works. We study the associated training problems from an optimal control
perspective and prove convergence results from the network learning problem to
its continuous-time counterpart. In particular, we show the convergence of
optimal values and the subsequence convergence of minimizers, using a piecewise
linear extension and $\Gamma$-convergence analysis. Our results provide a
mathematical foundation for understanding densely connected DNNs and further
suggest that such architectures can offer stability of training deep models.

Motivation: 单一流模型在不同类型的分布上表现不一致，需要一种能适应多种后验分布形状的鲁棒变分推断方法。

Method: 采用两阶段训练：先顺序训练各个流专家，然后通过似然驱动的更新进行自适应全局权重估计，无需逐样本门控或架构修改。

Result: 在六种典型后验分布上，AMF-VI实现了比单一流基线更低的负对数似然，并在Wasserstein-2和最大均值差异指标上获得稳定增益。

Conclusion: 自适应混合多样化流提供了一条可靠路径，可在保持各专家归纳偏好的同时，实现跨不同后验家族的鲁棒变分推断。

Abstract: Normalising-flow variational inference (VI) can approximate complex
posteriors, yet single-flow models often behave inconsistently across
qualitatively different distributions. We propose Adaptive Mixture Flow
Variational Inference (AMF-VI), a heterogeneous mixture of complementary flows
(MAF, RealNVP, RBIG) trained in two stages: (i) sequential expert training of
individual flows, and (ii) adaptive global weight estimation via
likelihood-driven updates, without per-sample gating or architectural changes.
Evaluated on six canonical posterior families of banana, X-shape, two-moons,
rings, a bimodal, and a five-mode mixture, AMF-VI achieves consistently lower
negative log-likelihood than each single-flow baseline and delivers stable
gains in transport metrics (Wasserstein-2) and maximum mean discrepancy (MDD),
indicating improved robustness across shapes and modalities. The procedure is
efficient and architecture-agnostic, incurring minimal overhead relative to
standard flow training, and demonstrates that adaptive mixtures of diverse
flows provide a reliable route to robust VI across diverse posterior families
whilst preserving each expert's inductive bias.

Abstract: Smart wearables enable continuous tracking of established biomarkers such as
heart rate, heart rate variability, and blood oxygen saturation via
photoplethysmography (PPG). Beyond these metrics, PPG waveforms contain richer
physiological information, as recent deep learning (DL) studies demonstrate.
However, DL models often rely on features with unclear physiological meaning,
creating a tension between predictive power, clinical interpretability, and
sensor design. We address this gap by introducing PPGen, a biophysical model
that relates PPG signals to interpretable physiological and optical parameters.
Building on PPGen, we propose hybrid amortized inference (HAI), enabling fast,
robust, and scalable estimation of relevant physiological parameters from PPG
signals while correcting for model misspecification. In extensive in-silico
experiments, we show that HAI can accurately infer physiological parameters
under diverse noise and sensor conditions. Our results illustrate a path toward
PPG models that retain the fidelity needed for DL-based features while
supporting clinical interpretation and informed hardware design.

Conclusion: 通过最大似然估计微调FM能有效缩小训练-推理差距，提高模型在高精度任务中的性能，特别是结合收缩特性的残差微调方法效果显著。

Abstract: Flow Matching (FM) algorithm achieves remarkable results in generative tasks
especially in robotic manipulation. Building upon the foundations of diffusion
models, the simulation-free paradigm of FM enables simple and efficient
training, but inherently introduces a train-inference gap. Specifically, we
cannot assess the model's output during the training phase. In contrast, other
generative models including Variational Autoencoder (VAE), Normalizing Flow and
Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) directly optimize on the reconstruction
loss. Such a gap is particularly evident in scenarios that demand high
precision, such as robotic manipulation. Moreover, we show that FM's
over-pursuit of straight predefined paths may introduce some serious problems
such as stiffness into the system. These motivate us to fine-tune FM via
Maximum Likelihood Estimation of reconstructions - an approach made feasible by
FM's underlying smooth ODE formulation, in contrast to the stochastic
differential equations (SDEs) used in diffusion models. This paper first
theoretically analyzes the relation between training loss and inference error
in FM. Then we propose a method of fine-tuning FM via Maximum Likelihood
Estimation of reconstructions, which includes both straightforward fine-tuning
and residual-based fine-tuning approaches. Furthermore, through specifically
designed architectures, the residual-based fine-tuning can incorporate the
contraction property into the model, which is crucial for the model's
robustness and interpretability. Experimental results in image generation and
robotic manipulation verify that our method reliably improves the inference
performance of FM.

Abstract: In the World Wide Web, reliable time series forecasts provide the
forward-looking signals that drive resource planning, cache placement, and
anomaly response, enabling platforms to operate efficiently as user behavior
and content distributions evolve. Compared with other domains, time series
forecasting for Web applications requires much faster responsiveness to support
real-time decision making. We present KAIROS, a non-autoregressive time series
forecasting framework that directly models segment-level multi-peak
distributions. Unlike autoregressive approaches, KAIROS avoids error
accumulation and achieves just-in-time inference, while improving over existing
non-autoregressive models that collapse to over-smoothed predictions. Trained
on the large-scale corpus, KAIROS demonstrates strong zero-shot generalization
on six widely used benchmarks, delivering forecasting performance comparable to
state-of-the-art foundation models with similar scale, at a fraction of their
inference cost. Beyond empirical results, KAIROS highlights the importance of
non-autoregressive design as a scalable paradigm for foundation models in time
series.

Abstract: The weights of neural networks have emerged as a novel data modality, giving
rise to the field of weight space learning. A central challenge in this area is
that learning meaningful representations of weights typically requires large,
carefully constructed collections of trained models, typically referred to as
model zoos. These model zoos are often trained ad-hoc, requiring large
computational resources, constraining the learned weight space representations
in scale and flexibility. In this work, we drop this requirement by training a
weight space learning backbone on arbitrary models downloaded from large,
unstructured model repositories such as Hugging Face. Unlike curated model
zoos, these repositories contain highly heterogeneous models: they vary in
architecture and dataset, and are largely undocumented. To address the
methodological challenges posed by such heterogeneity, we propose a new weight
space backbone designed to handle unstructured model populations. We
demonstrate that weight space representations trained on models from Hugging
Face achieve strong performance, often outperforming backbones trained on
laboratory-generated model zoos. Finally, we show that the diversity of the
model weights in our training set allows our weight space model to generalize
to unseen data modalities. By demonstrating that high-quality weight space
representations can be learned in the wild, we show that curated model zoos are
not indispensable, thereby overcoming a strong limitation currently faced by
the weight space learning community.

Abstract: AdaBoost sequentially fits so-called weak learners to minimize an exponential
loss, which penalizes mislabeled data points more severely than other loss
functions like cross-entropy. Paradoxically, AdaBoost generalizes well in
practice as the number of weak learners grows. In the present work, we
introduce Penalized Exponential Loss (PENEX), a new formulation of the
multi-class exponential loss that is theoretically grounded and, in contrast to
the existing formulation, amenable to optimization via first-order methods. We
demonstrate both empirically and theoretically that PENEX implicitly maximizes
margins of data points. Also, we show that gradient increments on PENEX
implicitly parameterize weak learners in the boosting framework. Across
computer vision and language tasks, we show that PENEX exhibits a regularizing
effect often better than established methods with similar computational cost.
Our results highlight PENEX's potential as an AdaBoost-inspired alternative for
effective training and fine-tuning of deep neural networks.

Result: 混合BiLSTM-XGBoost模型在准确性方面表现最佳，具有更低的RMSE、MAPE和MPE值，在数据有限的情况下也表现出稳健性能。

Abstract: Today, natural gas, as a clean fuel and the best alternative to crude oil,
covers a significant part of global demand. Iran is one of the largest
countries with energy resources and in terms of gas is the second-largest
country in the world. But, due to the increase in population and energy
consumption, it faces problems such as pressure drops and gas outages yearly in
cold seasons and therefore it is necessary to control gas consumption,
especially in the residential sector, which has the largest share in Iran. This
study aims to analyze and predict gas consumption for residential customers in
Zanjan province, Iran, using machine learning models, including LSTM, GRU, and
a hybrid BiLSTM-XGBoost model. The dataset consists of gas consumption and
meteorology data collected over six years, from 2017 to 2022. The models were
trained and evaluated based on their ability to accurately predict consumption
patterns. The results indicate that the hybrid BiLSTM-XGBoost model
outperformed the other models in terms of accuracy, with lower Root Mean
Squared Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) values, and Mean
Percentage Error (MPE). Additionally, the Hybrid model demonstrated robust
performance, particularly in scenarios with limited data. The findings suggest
that machine learning approaches, particularly hybrid models, can be
effectively utilized to manage and predict gas consumption, contributing to
more efficient resource management and reducing seasonal shortages. This study
highlights the importance of incorporating geographical and climatic factors in
predictive modeling, as these significantly influence gas usage across
different regions.

### [124] [Ensemble Threshold Calibration for Stable Sensitivity Control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02116)
*John N. Daras*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一个端到端框架，在大规模空间融合和实体匹配任务中实现精确的召回率控制，显著降低运行方差和冗余验证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在空间融合和实体匹配任务中，精确控制召回率至关重要，因为遗漏少量真实匹配会破坏下游分析，而过度的手动审查会增加成本。传统置信区间方法存在过度估计和高方差问题。

Method: 采用端到端流程：使用等网格边界框过滤和CSR候选表示减少对枚举；通过确定性xxHash引导样本训练轻量级神经排序器；构建可重现的分层校准集；集成四种阈值估计器并通过逆方差加权融合。

Result: 在两个真实地籍数据集（约631万和6734万对）上评估，该方法能稳定达到召回目标，减少冗余验证，并在单个TPU v3核心上运行。

Conclusion: 该框架在大规模空间匹配任务中实现了精确的召回率控制，显著降低了方差和成本，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Precise recall control is critical in large-scale spatial conflation and
entity-matching tasks, where missing even a few true matches can break
downstream analytics, while excessive manual review inflates cost. Classical
confidence-interval cuts such as Clopper-Pearson or Wilson provide lower bounds
on recall, but they routinely overshoot the target by several percentage points
and exhibit high run-to-run variance under skewed score distributions. We
present an end-to-end framework that achieves exact recall with sub-percent
variance over tens of millions of geometry pairs, while remaining TPU-friendly.
Our pipeline starts with an equigrid bounding-box filter and compressed sparse
row (CSR) candidate representation, reducing pair enumeration by two orders of
magnitude. A deterministic xxHash bootstrap sample trains a lightweight neural
ranker; its scores are propagated to all remaining pairs via a single forward
pass and used to construct a reproducible, score-decile-stratified calibration
set. Four complementary threshold estimators - Clopper-Pearson, Jeffreys,
Wilson, and an exact quantile - are aggregated via inverse-variance weighting,
then fused across nine independent subsamples. This ensemble reduces threshold
variance compared to any single method. Evaluated on two real cadastral
datasets (approximately 6.31M and 67.34M pairs), our approach consistently hits
a recall target within a small error, decreases redundant verifications
relative to other calibrations, and runs end-to-end on a single TPU v3 core.

TL;DR: DECOR是一个用于线性高斯结构方程模型的联合学习方法，能够同时学习有向无环图和相关噪声模型，在存在潜在混杂的情况下实现结构学习。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在误差独立时表现良好，而去混杂流程依赖于普遍因子结构或非线性。需要一种能够处理潜在混杂的统一方法。

Method: 提出DECOR方法，通过交替执行平滑无环图更新和凸噪声更新，联合学习DAG和相关噪声模型，可包含bow互补性惩罚或后处理协调步骤。

Result: 在合成基准测试中，DECOR匹配或优于强基线方法，特别在混杂非普遍时表现稳健，在普遍混杂情况下仍保持竞争力。

Conclusion: DECOR提供了一个完全可微的联合估计器，能够在存在潜在混杂的情况下有效学习线性高斯SEMs的结构和噪声模型。

Abstract: We study structure learning for linear Gaussian SEMs in the presence of
latent confounding. Existing continuous methods excel when errors are
independent, while deconfounding-first pipelines rely on pervasive factor
structure or nonlinearity. We propose \textsc{DECOR}, a single likelihood-based
and fully differentiable estimator that jointly learns a DAG and a correlated
noise model. Our theory gives simple sufficient conditions for global parameter
identifiability: if the mixed graph is bow free and the noise covariance has a
uniform eigenvalue margin, then the map from $(\B,\OmegaMat)$ to the
observational covariance is injective, so both the directed structure and the
noise are uniquely determined. The estimator alternates a smooth-acyclic graph
update with a convex noise update and can include a light bow complementarity
penalty or a post hoc reconciliation step. On synthetic benchmarks that vary
confounding density, graph density, latent rank, and dimension with $n<p$,
\textsc{DECOR} matches or outperforms strong baselines and is especially robust
when confounding is non-pervasive, while remaining competitive under
pervasiveness.

Abstract: Efficient and inexpensive energy storage is essential for accelerating the
adoption of renewable energy and ensuring a stable supply, despite fluctuations
in sources such as wind and solar. Electrocatalysts play a key role in hydrogen
energy storage (HES), allowing the energy to be stored as hydrogen. However,
the development of affordable and high-performance catalysts for this process
remains a significant challenge. We introduce Catalyst GFlowNet, a generative
model that leverages machine learning-based predictors of formation and
adsorption energy to design crystal surfaces that act as efficient catalysts.
We demonstrate the performance of the model through a proof-of-concept
application to the hydrogen evolution reaction, a key reaction in HES, for
which we successfully identified platinum as the most efficient known catalyst.
In future work, we aim to extend this approach to the oxygen evolution
reaction, where current optimal catalysts are expensive metal oxides, and open
the search space to discover new materials. This generative modeling framework
offers a promising pathway for accelerating the search for novel and efficient
catalysts.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 将扩散模型中的分类器自由引导机制扩展到经典策略梯度方法，提出策略梯度引导(PGG)，通过插值条件分支和无条件分支实现无需重新训练的行为调控。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 将扩散模型中成功的引导机制引入强化学习领域，为在线强化学习提供可控性，解决传统策略梯度方法缺乏测试时行为调控能力的问题。

Method: 在策略梯度中增加无条件分支，通过插值条件分支和无条件分支实现引导，理论推导显示在优势估计下归一化项消失，得到简洁的引导策略梯度更新公式。

Result: 在离散和连续控制基准测试中，条件丢弃在简单离散任务和低样本场景中有效，但会破坏连续控制的稳定性；适度增大引导系数能持续提升稳定性、样本效率和可控性。

Conclusion: 引导机制可以成功从扩散策略扩展到标准在线策略方法，为可控在线强化学习开辟了新方向。

Abstract: We introduce Policy Gradient Guidance (PGG), a simple extension of
classifier-free guidance from diffusion models to classical policy gradient
methods. PGG augments the policy gradient with an unconditional branch and
interpolates conditional and unconditional branches, yielding a test-time
control knob that modulates behavior without retraining. We provide a
theoretical derivation showing that the additional normalization term vanishes
under advantage estimation, leading to a clean guided policy gradient update.
Empirically, we evaluate PGG on discrete and continuous control benchmarks. We
find that conditioning dropout-central to diffusion guidance-offers gains in
simple discrete tasks and low sample regimes, but dropout destabilizes
continuous control. Training with modestly larger guidance ($\gamma>1$)
consistently improves stability, sample efficiency, and controllability. Our
results show that guidance, previously confined to diffusion policies, can be
adapted to standard on-policy methods, opening new directions for controllable
online reinforcement learning.

TL;DR: 本文研究了动作随机触发状态观测的强化学习问题，提出了ATST-MDP框架和动作序列学习范式，在线性MDP假设下开发了具有统计保证的离策略估计器和ST-LSVI-UCB算法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现实应用中状态观测由动作随机触发的强化学习问题，这类约束在许多实际场景中普遍存在。

Method: 提出了ATST-MDP框架，推导了定制的贝尔曼最优方程，引入了动作序列学习范式，并在线性MDP假设下开发了离策略估计器和ST-LSVI-UCB算法。

Result: ST-LSVI-UCB算法实现了$\widetilde O(\sqrt{Kd^3(1-\gamma)^{-3}})$的遗憾界，其中K是回合数，d是特征维度，γ是折扣因子。

Conclusion: 这项工作为在稀疏、动作触发的观测条件下学习建立了理论基础，证明了在这种观测约束下高效学习仍然是可行的。

Abstract: We study reinforcement learning problems where state observations are
stochastically triggered by actions, a constraint common in many real-world
applications. This framework is formulated as Action-Triggered Sporadically
Traceable Markov Decision Processes (ATST-MDPs), where each action has a
specified probability of triggering a state observation. We derive tailored
Bellman optimality equations for this framework and introduce the
action-sequence learning paradigm in which agents commit to executing a
sequence of actions until the next observation arrives. Under the linear MDP
assumption, value-functions are shown to admit linear representations in an
induced action-sequence feature map. Leveraging this structure, we propose
off-policy estimators with statistical error guarantees for such feature maps
and introduce ST-LSVI-UCB, a variant of LSVI-UCB adapted for action-triggered
settings. ST-LSVI-UCB achieves regret $\widetilde
O(\sqrt{Kd^3(1-\gamma)^{-3}})$, where $K$ is the number of episodes, $d$ the
feature dimension, and $\gamma$ the discount factor (per-step episode
non-termination probability). Crucially, this work establishes the theoretical
foundation for learning with sporadic, action-triggered observations while
demonstrating that efficient learning remains feasible under such observation
constraints.

Motivation: 传统SGLD无法偏向平坦最小值，而平坦最小值与深度学习泛化能力密切相关

Method: 使用随机权重扰动(RWP)评估随机梯度，优化随机平滑目标以捕获曲率信息，将fSGLD的不变测度与Hessian迹正则化损失函数的平稳测度联系起来

Result: 理论证明fSGLD收敛到全局最小化器，在Wasserstein距离上获得最佳收敛速率，实验在噪声标签和大规模视觉任务中显示优于或相当于基线算法，计算成本仅为SAM的一半

Conclusion: fSGLD能有效寻找平坦最小值，提供随机权重扰动的理论解释，在保持计算效率的同时提升泛化能力和鲁棒性

Abstract: Generalization in deep learning is closely tied to the pursuit of flat minima
in the loss landscape, yet classical Stochastic Gradient Langevin Dynamics
(SGLD) offers no mechanism to bias its dynamics toward such low-curvature
solutions. This work introduces Flatness-Aware Stochastic Gradient Langevin
Dynamics (fSGLD), designed to efficiently and provably seek flat minima in
high-dimensional nonconvex optimization problems. At each iteration, fSGLD uses
the stochastic gradient evaluated at parameters perturbed by isotropic Gaussian
noise, commonly referred to as Random Weight Perturbation (RWP), thereby
optimizing a randomized-smoothing objective that implicitly captures curvature
information. Leveraging these properties, we prove that the invariant measure
of fSGLD stays close to a stationary measure concentrated on the global
minimizers of a loss function regularized by the Hessian trace whenever the
inverse temperature and the scale of random weight perturbation are properly
coupled. This result provides a rigorous theoretical explanation for the
benefits of random weight perturbation. In particular, we establish
non-asymptotic convergence guarantees in Wasserstein distance with the best
known rate and derive an excess-risk bound for the Hessian-trace regularized
objective. Extensive experiments on noisy-label and large-scale vision tasks,
in both training-from-scratch and fine-tuning settings, demonstrate that fSGLD
achieves superior or comparable generalization and robustness to baseline
algorithms while maintaining the computational cost of SGD, about half that of
SAM. Hessian-spectrum analysis further confirms that fSGLD converges to
significantly flatter minima.

Conclusion: GRACE能够生成可解释的代码奖励函数，在多任务设置中构建复杂奖励API，解决了逆强化学习的可解释性问题。

Abstract: Inverse Reinforcement Learning aims to recover reward models from expert
demonstrations, but traditional methods yield "black-box" models that are
difficult to interpret and debug. In this work, we introduce GRACE (Generating
Rewards As CodE), a method for using Large Language Models within an
evolutionary search to reverse-engineer an interpretable, code-based reward
function directly from expert trajectories. The resulting reward function is
executable code that can be inspected and verified. We empirically validate
GRACE on the BabyAI and AndroidWorld benchmarks, where it efficiently learns
highly accurate rewards, even in complex, multi-task settings. Further, we
demonstrate that the resulting reward leads to strong policies, compared to
both competitive Imitation Learning and online RL approaches with ground-truth
rewards. Finally, we show that GRACE is able to build complex reward APIs in
multi-task setups.

Abstract: Objective: Chagas disease is a parasitic infection that is endemic to South
America, Central America, and, more recently, the U.S., primarily transmitted
by insects. Chronic Chagas disease can cause cardiovascular diseases and
digestive problems. Serological testing capacities for Chagas disease are
limited, but Chagas cardiomyopathy often manifests in ECGs, providing an
opportunity to prioritize patients for testing and treatment. Approach: The
George B. Moody PhysioNet Challenge 2025 invites teams to develop algorithmic
approaches for identifying Chagas disease from electrocardiograms (ECGs). Main
results: This Challenge provides multiple innovations. First, we leveraged
several datasets with labels from patient reports and serological testing,
provided a large dataset with weak labels and smaller datasets with strong
labels. Second, we augmented the data to support model robustness and
generalizability to unseen data sources. Third, we applied an evaluation metric
that captured the local serological testing capacity for Chagas disease to
frame the machine learning problem as a triage task. Significance: Over 630
participants from 111 teams submitted over 1300 entries during the Challenge,
representing diverse approaches from academia and industry worldwide.

TL;DR: Poolformer是一种序列到序列模型，用循环层和池化操作替换自注意力机制，解决了长序列处理中自注意力二次复杂度的问题，在音频处理任务中表现优于现有先进模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自注意力机制在长序列处理中存在二次复杂度问题，限制了其在实际应用中的实用性。需要开发更高效的序列建模方法来处理长序列数据。

Method: 提出Poolformer模型，用循环层替换自注意力，引入池化操作减少序列长度。模型采用递归定义的SkipBlocks结构，包含残差块、下采样池化层、嵌套SkipBlock、上采样池化层和额外残差块。

Result: 池化操作显著加速训练过程，改善感知指标（FID和IS），防止过拟合。在原始音频处理任务中，Poolformer优于SaShiMi和Mamba等先进模型。深层处理长程依赖，浅层处理短期特征。

Conclusion: Poolformer为长序列处理提供了高效解决方案，未来可应用于文本、视觉和多模态场景，基于Poolformer的大语言模型能有效处理图像和视频的密集表示。

Abstract: Sequence-to-sequence models have become central in Artificial Intelligence,
particularly following the introduction of the transformer architecture. While
initially developed for Natural Language Processing, these models have
demonstrated utility across domains, including Computer Vision. Such models
require mechanisms to exchange information along the time dimension, typically
using recurrent or self-attention layers. However, self-attention scales
quadratically with sequence length, limiting its practicality for very long
sequences.
  We introduce Poolformer, a sequence-to-sequence model that replaces
self-attention with recurrent layers and incorporates pooling operations to
reduce sequence length. Poolformer is defined recursively using SkipBlocks,
which contain residual blocks, a down-pooling layer, a nested SkipBlock, an
up-pooling layer, and additional residual blocks. We conduct extensive
experiments to support our architectural choices.
  Our results show that pooling greatly accelerates training, improves
perceptual metrics (FID and IS), and prevents overfitting. Our experiments also
suggest that long-range dependencies are handled by deep layers, while shallow
layers take care of short-term features.
  Evaluated on raw audio, which naturally features long sequence lengths,
Poolformer outperforms state-of-the-art models such as SaShiMi and Mamba.
Future directions include applications to text and vision, as well as
multi-modal scenarios, where a Poolformer-based LLM could effectively process
dense representations of images and videos.

Motivation: 现有金融基准主要测试静态知识问答，无法捕捉交易的动态和迭代特性，金融领域对LLM代理的评估仍未被充分探索。

Method: 引入StockBench基准，让代理接收每日市场信号（价格、基本面、新闻），并做出顺序的买入、卖出或持有决策，使用累积回报、最大回撤和索提诺比率等金融指标评估性能。

Result: 评估显示大多数LLM代理难以超越买入持有基准，但几个模型显示出提供更高回报和更有效管理风险的潜力。

Conclusion: 精通静态金融知识任务不一定能转化为成功的交易策略，StockBench作为开源资源发布以支持可重复性和未来研究。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated strong capabilities
as autonomous agents, showing promise in reasoning, tool use, and sequential
decision-making. While prior benchmarks have evaluated LLM agents in domains
such as software engineering and scientific discovery, the finance domain
remains underexplored, despite its direct relevance to economic value and
high-stakes decision-making. Existing financial benchmarks primarily test
static knowledge through question answering, but they fall short of capturing
the dynamic and iterative nature of trading. To address this gap, we introduce
StockBench, a contamination-free benchmark designed to evaluate LLM agents in
realistic, multi-month stock trading environments. Agents receive daily market
signals -- including prices, fundamentals, and news -- and must make sequential
buy, sell, or hold decisions. Performance is assessed using financial metrics
such as cumulative return, maximum drawdown, and the Sortino ratio. Our
evaluation of state-of-the-art proprietary (e.g., GPT-5, Claude-4) and
open-weight (e.g., Qwen3, Kimi-K2, GLM-4.5) models shows that while most LLM
agents struggle to outperform the simple buy-and-hold baseline, several models
demonstrate the potential to deliver higher returns and manage risk more
effectively. These findings highlight both the challenges and opportunities in
developing LLM-powered financial agents, showing that excelling at static
financial knowledge tasks does not necessarily translate into successful
trading strategies. We release StockBench as an open-source resource to support
reproducibility and advance future research in this domain.

TL;DR: DiFFPO是一个统一的强化学习框架，用于训练掩码扩散大语言模型（dLLMs），使其推理能力更强（furious）且速度更快（fast）。通过离策略RL训练代理策略，结合两阶段似然近似和重要性采样校正，提高样本效率和任务性能。同时联合训练高效采样器/控制器，让模型自适应分配推理阈值，在减少函数评估次数的同时获得更好性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法如d1在训练dLLMs时存在似然计算困难的问题。需要开发一个既能提升推理质量又能加快推理速度的统一框架，通过RL优化dLLMs的多token预测能力，改善推理时计算量的帕累托前沿。

Method: 1. 使用离策略RL训练代理策略，提出更准确的两阶段似然近似结合重要性采样校正；2. 联合训练dLLMs策略的高效采样器/控制器，让模型学习为每个提示自适应分配推理阈值；3. 在数学和规划基准任务上训练开源大扩散语言模型。

Result: 相比仅训练模型，联合训练采样器能在更少的函数评估次数（NFEs）下获得更好的准确率，在改善dLLMs推理时计算量的帕累托前沿方面达到最佳性能。

Conclusion: DiFFPO框架通过RL统一优化dLLMs的推理质量和速度，提出的两阶段似然近似和联合采样器训练方法有效提高了样本效率和任务性能，为dLLMs的推理优化提供了新方向。

Abstract: We propose DiFFPO, Diffusion Fast and Furious Policy Optimization, a unified
framework for training masked diffusion large language models (dLLMs) to reason
not only better (furious), but also faster via reinforcement learning (RL). We
first unify the existing baseline approach such as d1 by proposing to train
surrogate policies via off-policy RL, whose likelihood is much more tractable
as an approximation to the true dLLM policy. This naturally motivates a more
accurate and informative two-stage likelihood approximation combined with
importance sampling correction, which leads to generalized RL algorithms with
better sample efficiency and superior task performance. Second, we propose a
new direction of joint training efficient samplers/controllers of dLLMs policy.
Via RL, we incentivize dLLMs' natural multi-token prediction capabilities by
letting the model learn to adaptively allocate an inference threshold for each
prompt. By jointly training the sampler, we yield better accuracies with lower
number of function evaluations (NFEs) compared to training the model only,
obtaining the best performance in improving the Pareto frontier of the
inference-time compute of dLLMs. We showcase the effectiveness of our pipeline
by training open source large diffusion language models over benchmark math and
planning tasks.

TL;DR: 提出C2AL方法，通过分析数据集子结构和利用部分冲突的辅助标签来正则化共享表示，解决推荐模型中用户群体异质性导致的注意力机制失效问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模推荐模型在单一全局目标下训练时，假设用户群体同质性，但真实数据由异质群体组成。随着模型规模和复杂度增加，模型会偏向中心分布模式，忽视头部和尾部区域，导致注意力权重失效或神经元死亡。

Method: 分析数据集子结构，通过具有强分布对比的辅助学习来暴露这些结构。利用部分冲突的辅助标签正则化共享表示，定制注意力层学习过程以保持与少数群体的互信息，同时提升全局性能。

Result: 在包含数十亿数据点的生产数据集上评估六个SOTA模型，因子分解机能够使用该方法捕获细粒度用户-广告交互，整体归一化熵降低达0.16%，在目标少数群体上增益超过0.30%。

Conclusion: C2AL方法通过辅助学习有效解决了推荐模型中的分布不平衡问题，显著提升了模型在少数群体上的性能，同时改善了全局表现。

Abstract: Training large-scale recommendation models under a single global objective
implicitly assumes homogeneity across user populations. However, real-world
data are composites of heterogeneous cohorts with distinct conditional
distributions. As models increase in scale and complexity and as more data is
used for training, they become dominated by central distribution patterns,
neglecting head and tail regions. This imbalance limits the model's learning
ability and can result in inactive attention weights or dead neurons. In this
paper, we reveal how the attention mechanism can play a key role in
factorization machines for shared embedding selection, and propose to address
this challenge by analyzing the substructures in the dataset and exposing those
with strong distributional contrast through auxiliary learning. Unlike previous
research, which heuristically applies weighted labels or multi-task heads to
mitigate such biases, we leverage partially conflicting auxiliary labels to
regularize the shared representation. This approach customizes the learning
process of attention layers to preserve mutual information with minority
cohorts while improving global performance. We evaluated C2AL on massive
production datasets with billions of data points each for six SOTA models.
Experiments show that the factorization machine is able to capture fine-grained
user-ad interactions using the proposed method, achieving up to a 0.16%
reduction in normalized entropy overall and delivering gains exceeding 0.30% on
targeted minority cohorts.

Abstract: Imputation methods play a critical role in enhancing the quality of practical
time-series data, which often suffer from pervasive missing values. Recently,
diffusion-based generative imputation methods have demonstrated remarkable
success compared to autoregressive and conventional statistical approaches.
Despite their empirical success, the theoretical understanding of how well
diffusion-based models capture complex spatial and temporal dependencies
between the missing values and observed ones remains limited. Our work
addresses this gap by investigating the statistical efficiency of conditional
diffusion transformers for imputation and quantifying the uncertainty in
missing values. Specifically, we derive statistical sample complexity bounds
based on a novel approximation theory for conditional score functions using
transformers, and, through this, construct tight confidence regions for missing
values. Our findings also reveal that the efficiency and accuracy of imputation
are significantly influenced by the missing patterns. Furthermore, we validate
these theoretical insights through simulation and propose a mixed-masking
training strategy to enhance the imputation performance.

TL;DR: 提出一种基于copula的方法，能够从现有的多步时间序列基础模型中高效生成具有相关结构的预测样本路径，相比自回归采样速度提升数个数量级。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有时间序列基础模型只能预测每个时间步的独立边际分布，无法生成完整的联合预测分布。要生成具有现实相关结构的预测样本路径，通常需要昂贵的自回归采样。

Method: 采用copula方法，在单次前向传递中从现有的多步时间序列基础模型生成相关的样本路径。

Result: copula方法生成相关样本路径的速度比自回归采样快数个数量级，并通过减轻误差累积现象提高了样本路径质量。

Conclusion: 基于copula的方法能够高效生成准确、相关的样本路径，解决了现有模型只能预测独立边际分布的问题。

Abstract: Many time series applications require access to multi-step forecast
trajectories in the form of sample paths. Recently, time series foundation
models have leveraged multi-step lookahead predictions to improve the quality
and efficiency of multi-step forecasts. However, these models only predict
independent marginal distributions for each time step, rather than a full joint
predictive distribution. To generate forecast sample paths with realistic
correlation structures, one typically resorts to autoregressive sampling, which
can be extremely expensive. In this paper, we present a copula-based approach
to efficiently generate accurate, correlated sample paths from existing
multi-step time series foundation models in one forward pass. Our copula-based
approach generates correlated sample paths orders of magnitude faster than
autoregressive sampling, and it yields improved sample path quality by
mitigating the snowballing error phenomenon.

*Maximilian Beck,Kajetan Schweighofer,Sebastian Böck,Sebastian Lehner,Sepp Hochreiter*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 对比研究Transformer和xLSTM的缩放规律，发现在典型LLM训练和推理场景中，xLSTM相比Transformer具有更优的缩放特性，且随着训练和推理上下文长度的增加，xLSTM的优势更加明显。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然Transformer是主导架构，但xLSTM等替代方案在十亿参数级别保持竞争力的同时具有线性复杂度。需要比较不同架构的缩放行为，为未来模型设计和部署提供指导。

Method: 采用IsoFLOP和参数拟合方法，在80M-7B模型规模和2B-2T训练token范围内研究xLSTM在计算最优和过训练情况下的缩放行为；分析最优模型大小对上下文长度的依赖性；研究推理时的缩放特性。

Result: 在典型LLM训练和推理场景中，xLSTM相比Transformer具有更优的缩放特性；xLSTM的优势随着训练和推理上下文长度的增加而扩大。

Conclusion: xLSTM在缩放特性上优于Transformer，特别是在长上下文场景中表现更佳，这为未来大语言模型架构选择提供了重要参考。

Abstract: Scaling laws play a central role in the success of Large Language Models
(LLMs), enabling the prediction of model performance relative to compute
budgets prior to training. While Transformers have been the dominant
architecture, recent alternatives such as xLSTM offer linear complexity with
respect to context length while remaining competitive in the billion-parameter
regime. We conduct a comparative investigation on the scaling behavior of
Transformers and xLSTM along the following lines, providing insights to guide
future model design and deployment. First, we study the scaling behavior for
xLSTM in compute-optimal and over-training regimes using both IsoFLOP and
parametric fit approaches on a wide range of model sizes (80M-7B) and number of
training tokens (2B-2T). Second, we examine the dependence of optimal model
sizes on context length, a pivotal aspect that was largely ignored in previous
work. Finally, we analyze inference-time scaling characteristics. Our findings
reveal that in typical LLM training and inference scenarios, xLSTM scales
favorably compared to Transformers. Importantly, xLSTM's advantage widens as
training and inference contexts grow.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了PUL-Inter-Slice Defender，一种基于正未标记学习和LSTM自编码器+K-Means聚类的异常检测方案，用于保护5G网络切片免受分布式切片移动性攻击。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 5G网络中用户设备可以在多个网络切片间无缝切换，但这种灵活性可能被利用来发起分布式切片移动性攻击，这是一种分布式拒绝服务攻击形式。

Method: 采用正未标记学习，结合长短期记忆自编码器和K-Means聚类，利用3GPP关键性能指标和性能测量计数器作为机器学习模型特征。

Result: 在基于free5GC和UERANSIM的5G测试床上评估，当训练数据包含10%-40%攻击污染时，F1分数超过98.50%，优于对比方案。

Conclusion: PUL-Inter-Slice Defender能够有效检测分布式切片移动性攻击变体，并在训练数据受污染时保持鲁棒性。

Abstract: Network Slices (NSs) are virtual networks operating over a shared physical
infrastructure, each designed to meet specific application requirements while
maintaining consistent Quality of Service (QoS). In Fifth Generation (5G)
networks, User Equipment (UE) can connect to and seamlessly switch between
multiple NSs to access diverse services. However, this flexibility, known as
Inter-Slice Switching (ISS), introduces a potential vulnerability that can be
exploited to launch Distributed Slice Mobility (DSM) attacks, a form of
Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack. To secure 5G networks and their
NSs against DSM attacks, we present in this work, PUL-Inter-Slice Defender; an
anomaly detection solution that leverages Positive Unlabeled Learning (PUL) and
incorporates a combination of Long Short-Term Memory Autoencoders and K-Means
clustering. PUL-Inter-Slice Defender leverages the Third Generation Partnership
Project (3GPP) key performance indicators and performance measurement counters
as features for its machine learning models to detect DSM attack variants while
maintaining robustness in the presence of contaminated training data. When
evaluated on data collected from our 5G testbed based on the open-source
free5GC and UERANSIM, a UE/ Radio Access Network (RAN) simulator;
PUL-Inter-Slice Defender achieved F1-scores exceeding 98.50% on training
datasets with 10% to 40% attack contamination, consistently outperforming its
counterpart Inter-Slice Defender and other PUL based solutions combining
One-Class Support Vector Machine (OCSVM) with Random Forest and XGBoost.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出Drop-Muon方法，挑战传统深度学习优化中每步更新所有层的做法，通过随机选择部分层进行更新，结合渐进式训练和非欧几里得更新，实现更高效的训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统深度学习优化器（如Muon）每步更新所有层的做法可能不是最优的，作者希望探索部分层更新的潜力，以提高训练效率。

Method: Drop-Muon方法：随机选择部分层进行更新，采用渐进式训练策略，结合层特定的非欧几里得更新。

Result: 在CNN实验中，Drop-Muon比全网络更新的Muon快1.4倍达到相同精度，提供了收敛性理论保证。

Conclusion: 全网络更新不是最优策略，Drop-Muon提供了一种理论上严谨且实践高效的替代方案，有望改变大规模模型的训练方式。

Abstract: Conventional wisdom in deep learning optimization dictates updating all
layers at every step-a principle followed by all recent state-of-the-art
optimizers such as Muon. In this work, we challenge this assumption, showing
that full-network updates can be fundamentally suboptimal, both in theory and
in practice. We introduce a non-Euclidean Randomized Progressive Training
method-Drop-Muon-a simple yet powerful framework that updates only a subset of
layers per step according to a randomized schedule, combining the efficiency of
progressive training with layer-specific non-Euclidean updates for top-tier
performance. We provide rigorous convergence guarantees under both layer-wise
smoothness and layer-wise $(L^0, L^1)$-smoothness, covering deterministic and
stochastic gradient settings, marking the first such results for progressive
training in the stochastic and non-smooth regime. Our cost analysis further
reveals that full-network updates are not optimal unless a very specific
relationship between layer smoothness constants holds. Through controlled CNN
experiments, we empirically demonstrate that Drop-Muon consistently outperforms
full-network Muon, achieving the same accuracy up to $1.4\times$ faster in
wall-clock time. Together, our results suggest a shift in how large-scale
models can be efficiently trained, challenging the status quo and offering a
highly efficient, theoretically grounded alternative to full-network updates.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了ExGRPO框架，通过识别推理经验的价值指标（正确性和熵）来组织和优先利用有价值的经验，使用混合策略目标平衡探索与经验利用，显著提升了RLVR的训练效率和稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准在线策略训练在单次更新后丢弃经验，导致计算效率低下和不稳定性。虽然已有研究强调重用过去经验的好处，但经验特性在大型推理模型学习动态中的作用仍未被充分探索。

Method: 提出ExGRPO框架：1）识别推理经验的价值指标（正确性和熵）；2）组织和优先利用有价值的经验；3）使用混合策略目标平衡探索与经验利用。

Result: 在五个骨干模型（1.5B-8B参数）上的实验显示，ExGRPO在数学/通用基准上平均提升3.5/7.6分，比在线RLVR方法表现更好，并在强弱模型上都能稳定训练。

Conclusion: 原则性的经验管理是高效可扩展RLVR的关键要素，ExGRPO通过有效利用经验价值指标显著提升了推理性能和训练稳定性。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning from verifiable rewards (RLVR) is an emerging paradigm
for improving the reasoning ability of large language models. However, standard
on-policy training discards rollout experiences after a single update, leading
to computational inefficiency and instability. While prior work on RL has
highlighted the benefits of reusing past experience, the role of experience
characteristics in shaping learning dynamics of large reasoning models remains
underexplored. In this paper, we are the first to investigate what makes a
reasoning experience valuable and identify rollout correctness and entropy as
effective indicators of experience value. Based on these insights, we propose
ExGRPO (Experiential Group Relative Policy Optimization), a framework that
organizes and prioritizes valuable experiences, and employs a mixed-policy
objective to balance exploration with experience exploitation. Experiments on
five backbone models (1.5B-8B parameters) show that ExGRPO consistently
improves reasoning performance on mathematical/general benchmarks, with an
average gain of +3.5/7.6 points over on-policy RLVR. Moreover, ExGRPO
stabilizes training on both stronger and weaker models where on-policy methods
fail. These results highlight principled experience management as a key
ingredient for efficient and scalable RLVR.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 研究表明，未经修改的标准Transformer可以直接在笛卡尔坐标上训练，无需预定义图结构或物理先验，就能达到与最先进等变GNN相当的分子能量和力预测精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统GNN在分子机器学习中依赖预定义的图结构（如固定半径截断或k近邻），这种硬编码的图结构限制了表达能力并降低了推理速度。本文探索是否纯Transformer可以直接处理笛卡尔坐标来近似分子能量和力。

Method: 使用标准Transformer架构，直接在笛卡尔坐标上训练，不引入预定义图结构或物理先验。在OMol25数据集上，与等变GNN在相同训练计算预算下进行比较。

Result: Transformer达到了与最先进等变GNN竞争的能量和力平均绝对误差。模型自适应学习了物理一致的模式，如注意力权重随原子间距离反比衰减，并能灵活适应不同分子环境。

Conclusion: Transformer能够自适应地学习GNN的有利特性，挑战了硬编码图归纳偏置的必要性，为分子建模提供了标准化、可扩展的架构方向。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are the dominant architecture for molecular
machine learning, particularly for molecular property prediction and machine
learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs). GNNs perform message passing on
predefined graphs often induced by a fixed radius cutoff or k-nearest neighbor
scheme. While this design aligns with the locality present in many molecular
tasks, a hard-coded graph can limit expressivity due to the fixed receptive
field and slows down inference with sparse graph operations. In this work, we
investigate whether pure, unmodified Transformers trained directly on Cartesian
coordinates$\unicode{x2013}$without predefined graphs or physical
priors$\unicode{x2013}$can approximate molecular energies and forces. As a
starting point for our analysis, we demonstrate how to train a Transformer to
competitive energy and force mean absolute errors under a matched training
compute budget, relative to a state-of-the-art equivariant GNN on the OMol25
dataset. We discover that the Transformer learns physically consistent
patterns$\unicode{x2013}$such as attention weights that decay inversely with
interatomic distance$\unicode{x2013}$and flexibly adapts them across different
molecular environments due to the absence of hard-coded biases. The use of a
standard Transformer also unlocks predictable improvements with respect to
scaling training resources, consistent with empirical scaling laws observed in
other domains. Our results demonstrate that many favorable properties of GNNs
can emerge adaptively in Transformers, challenging the necessity of hard-coded
graph inductive biases and pointing toward standardized, scalable architectures
for molecular modeling.

Motivation: 研究如何应对采用动态策略选择信道和感知阈值的反应式干扰器，在缺乏信道条件和干扰策略先验知识的情况下避免干扰并优化吞吐量。

Method: 采用Q-learning处理离散干扰事件状态，使用深度Q网络(DQN)处理基于接收功率的连续状态，通过不同奖励函数和动作集进行学习。

Result: 强化学习能够快速适应频谱动态变化，在信道和干扰策略随时间变化时维持高传输速率。

Conclusion: 强化学习是应对反应式干扰的有效方法，能够自适应地优化传输策略以维持高吞吐量。

Abstract: This paper studies the problem of mitigating reactive jamming, where a jammer
adopts a dynamic policy of selecting channels and sensing thresholds to detect
and jam ongoing transmissions. The transmitter-receiver pair learns to avoid
jamming and optimize throughput over time (without prior knowledge of channel
conditions or jamming strategies) by using reinforcement learning (RL) to adapt
transmit power, modulation, and channel selection. Q-learning is employed for
discrete jamming-event states, while Deep Q-Networks (DQN) are employed for
continuous states based on received power. Through different reward functions
and action sets, the results show that RL can adapt rapidly to spectrum
dynamics and sustain high rates as channels and jamming policies change over
time.

TL;DR: Diffusion^2是一种基于扩散模型的方法，使用3D点云建模从Wi-Fi到毫米波的射频信号传播，通过RF-3D编码器捕捉3D几何特征，实现比现有方法快27倍、误差仅1.9 dB的准确预测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 射频信号传播建模对于环境理解和无线网络优化至关重要，但复杂环境中的准确预测仍然困难，因为信号会与障碍物发生吸收和反射等相互作用。

Method: 提出Diffusion^2方法，使用3D点云建模射频信号传播；开发RF-3D编码器捕捉3D几何特征和信号细节；采用多尺度嵌入模拟实际RF信号传播过程。

Result: 在合成和真实测量数据上的评估显示，Diffusion^2在各种频段和环境条件下准确估计RF信号行为，误差仅为1.9 dB，比现有方法快27倍。

Conclusion: Diffusion^2在射频信号传播建模领域取得了显著进展，为无线诊断、部署和优化提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Modeling radio frequency (RF) signal propagation is essential for
understanding the environment, as RF signals offer valuable insights beyond the
capabilities of RGB cameras, which are limited by the visible-light spectrum,
lens coverage, and occlusions. It is also useful for supporting wireless
diagnosis, deployment, and optimization. However, accurately predicting RF
signals in complex environments remains a challenge due to interactions with
obstacles such as absorption and reflection. We introduce Diffusion^2, a
diffusion-based approach that uses 3D point clouds to model the propagation of
RF signals across a wide range of frequencies, from Wi-Fi to millimeter waves.
To effectively capture RF-related features from 3D data, we present the RF-3D
Encoder, which encapsulates the complexities of 3D geometry along with
signal-specific details. These features undergo multi-scale embedding to
simulate the actual RF signal dissemination process. Our evaluation, based on
synthetic and real-world measurements, demonstrates that Diffusion^2 accurately
estimates the behavior of RF signals in various frequency bands and
environmental conditions, with an error margin of just 1.9 dB and 27x faster
than existing methods, marking a significant advancement in the field. Refer to

Abstract: Traffic forecasting on road networks is a complex task of significant
practical importance that has recently attracted considerable attention from
the machine learning community, with spatiotemporal graph neural networks
(GNNs) becoming the most popular approach. The proper evaluation of traffic
forecasting methods requires realistic datasets, but current publicly available
benchmarks have significant drawbacks, including the absence of information
about road connectivity for road graph construction, limited information about
road properties, and a relatively small number of road segments that falls
short of real-world applications. Further, current datasets mostly contain
information about intercity highways with sparsely located sensors, while city
road networks arguably present a more challenging forecasting task due to much
denser roads and more complex urban traffic patterns. In this work, we provide
a more complete, realistic, and challenging benchmark for traffic forecasting
by releasing datasets representing the road networks of two major cities, with
the largest containing almost 100,000 road segments (more than a 10-fold
increase relative to existing datasets). Our datasets contain rich road
features and provide fine-grained data about both traffic volume and traffic
speed, allowing for building more holistic traffic forecasting systems. We show
that most current implementations of neural spatiotemporal models for traffic
forecasting have problems scaling to datasets of our size. To overcome this
issue, we propose an alternative approach to neural traffic forecasting that
uses a GNN without a dedicated module for temporal sequence processing, thus
achieving much better scalability, while also demonstrating stronger
forecasting performance. We hope our datasets and modeling insights will serve
as a valuable resource for research in traffic forecasting.

Abstract: Hallucinations are a common issue that undermine the reliability of large
language models (LLMs). Recent studies have identified a specific subset of
hallucinations, known as confabulations, which arise due to predictive
uncertainty of LLMs. To detect confabulations, various methods for estimating
predictive uncertainty in natural language generation (NLG) have been
developed. These methods are typically evaluated by correlating uncertainty
estimates with the correctness of generated text, with question-answering (QA)
datasets serving as the standard benchmark. However, commonly used approximate
correctness functions have substantial disagreement between each other and,
consequently, in the ranking of the uncertainty estimation methods. This allows
one to inflate the apparent performance of uncertainty estimation methods. We
propose using several alternative risk indicators for risk correlation
experiments that improve robustness of empirical assessment of UE algorithms
for NLG. For QA tasks, we show that marginalizing over multiple LLM-as-a-judge
variants leads to reducing the evaluation biases. Furthermore, we explore
structured tasks as well as out of distribution and perturbation detection
tasks which provide robust and controllable risk indicators. Finally, we
propose to use an Elo rating of uncertainty estimation methods to give an
objective summarization over extensive evaluation settings.

Conclusion: DialTree-RPO能有效发现多样化的多轮攻击策略，证明了强化学习在自动发现模型安全漏洞方面的潜力。

Abstract: Despite recent rapid progress in AI safety, current large language models
remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks in multi-turn interaction settings,
where attackers strategically adapt their prompts across conversation turns and
pose a more critical yet realistic challenge. Existing approaches that discover
safety vulnerabilities either rely on manual red-teaming with human experts or
employ automated methods using pre-defined templates and human-curated attack
data, with most focusing on single-turn attacks. However, these methods did not
explore the vast space of possible multi-turn attacks, failing to consider
novel attack trajectories that emerge from complex dialogue dynamics and
strategic conversation planning. This gap is particularly critical given recent
findings that LLMs exhibit significantly higher vulnerability to multi-turn
attacks compared to single-turn attacks. We propose DialTree-RPO, an on-policy
reinforcement learning framework integrated with tree search that autonomously
discovers diverse multi-turn attack strategies by treating the dialogue as a
sequential decision-making problem, enabling systematic exploration without
manually curated data. Through extensive experiments, our approach not only
achieves more than 25.9% higher ASR across 10 target models compared to
previous state-of-the-art approaches, but also effectively uncovers new attack
strategies by learning optimal dialogue policies that maximize attack success
across multiple turns.

Conclusion: APS方法有效克服了离散扩散后验采样的现有挑战，在无需训练的风格化和文本引导编辑中展现出优势。

Abstract: We study the problem of posterior sampling using pretrained discrete
diffusion foundation models, aiming to recover images from noisy measurements
without retraining task-specific models. While diffusion models have achieved
remarkable success in generative modeling, most advances rely on continuous
Gaussian diffusion. In contrast, discrete diffusion offers a unified framework
for jointly modeling categorical data such as text and images. Beyond
unification, discrete diffusion provides faster inference, finer control, and
principled training-free Bayesian inference, making it particularly well-suited
for posterior sampling. However, existing approaches to discrete diffusion
posterior sampling face severe challenges: derivative-free guidance yields
sparse signals, continuous relaxations limit applicability, and split Gibbs
samplers suffer from the curse of dimensionality. To overcome these
limitations, we introduce Anchored Posterior Sampling (APS) for masked
diffusion foundation models, built on two key innovations -- quantized
expectation for gradient-like guidance in discrete embedding space, and
anchored remasking for adaptive decoding. Our approach achieves
state-of-the-art performance among discrete diffusion samplers across linear
and nonlinear inverse problems on the standard benchmarks. We further
demonstrate the benefits of our approach in training-free stylization and
text-guided editing.

real-world applications yet computationally challenging. We present a novel
learning strategy of Concept Neuron Selection (CNS), a simple yet effective
approach to perform personalization in a continual learning scheme. CNS
uniquely identifies neurons in diffusion models that are closely related to the
target concepts. In order to mitigate catastrophic forgetting problems while
preserving zero-shot text-to-image generation ability, CNS finetunes concept
neurons in an incremental manner and jointly preserves knowledge learned of
previous concepts. Evaluation of real-world datasets demonstrates that CNS
achieves state-of-the-art performance with minimal parameter adjustments,
outperforming previous methods in both single and multi-concept personalization
works. CNS also achieves fusion-free operation, reducing memory storage and
processing time for continual personalization.

TL;DR: 提出了Interactive Training框架，实现神经网络训练过程中的人机交互式干预，通过控制服务器让用户或AI代理实时调整优化器参数、训练数据和模型检查点。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统神经网络训练遵循固定的优化方案，缺乏动态响应训练不稳定或问题的灵活性。

Method: 使用控制服务器作为用户/代理与训练过程之间的中介，支持实时调整优化器超参数、训练数据和模型检查点。

Result: 通过三个案例研究表明，该框架实现了更好的训练稳定性、降低了对初始超参数的敏感性，并提高了对用户需求变化的适应性。

Conclusion: 该框架为未来AI代理自主监控训练日志、主动解决不稳定问题和优化训练动态的训练范式铺平了道路。

Abstract: Traditional neural network training typically follows fixed, predefined
optimization recipes, lacking the flexibility to dynamically respond to
instabilities or emerging training issues. In this paper, we introduce
Interactive Training, an open-source framework that enables real-time,
feedback-driven intervention during neural network training by human experts or
automated AI agents. At its core, Interactive Training uses a control server to
mediate communication between users or agents and the ongoing training process,
allowing users to dynamically adjust optimizer hyperparameters, training data,
and model checkpoints. Through three case studies, we demonstrate that
Interactive Training achieves superior training stability, reduced sensitivity
to initial hyperparameters, and improved adaptability to evolving user needs,
paving the way toward a future training paradigm where AI agents autonomously
monitor training logs, proactively resolve instabilities, and optimize training
dynamics.

TL;DR: 提出了平衡匹配(EqM)生成建模框架，通过平衡动态视角学习隐式能量景观的平衡梯度，采用基于优化的采样过程，在ImageNet 256×256上达到1.90 FID。


<details>

Motivation: 传统扩散和基于流的生成模型使用非平衡、时间条件动态，EqM旨在通过平衡动态视角改进生成建模。

Method: 丢弃传统模型的时间条件动态，学习隐式能量景观的平衡梯度，在推理时采用基于优化的采样过程，使用可调节步长、自适应优化器和自适应计算。

Result: 在ImageNet 256×256上达到1.90 FID，超越了扩散/流模型的生成性能，并能处理部分噪声图像去噪、OOD检测和图像合成等任务。

Conclusion: EqM通过用统一的平衡景观替代时间条件速度，在流模型和基于能量的模型之间建立了更紧密的桥梁，提供了优化驱动推理的简单途径。

Abstract: We introduce Equilibrium Matching (EqM), a generative modeling framework
built from an equilibrium dynamics perspective. EqM discards the
non-equilibrium, time-conditional dynamics in traditional diffusion and
flow-based generative models and instead learns the equilibrium gradient of an
implicit energy landscape. Through this approach, we can adopt an
optimization-based sampling process at inference time, where samples are
obtained by gradient descent on the learned landscape with adjustable step
sizes, adaptive optimizers, and adaptive compute. EqM surpasses the generation
performance of diffusion/flow models empirically, achieving an FID of 1.90 on
ImageNet 256$\times$256. EqM is also theoretically justified to learn and
sample from the data manifold. Beyond generation, EqM is a flexible framework
that naturally handles tasks including partially noised image denoising, OOD
detection, and image composition. By replacing time-conditional velocities with
a unified equilibrium landscape, EqM offers a tighter bridge between flow and
energy-based models and a simple route to optimization-driven inference.

Abstract: We propose the task of knowledge distillation detection, which aims to
determine whether a student model has been distilled from a given teacher,
under a practical setting where only the student's weights and the teacher's
API are available. This problem is motivated by growing concerns about model
provenance and unauthorized replication through distillation. To address this
task, we introduce a model-agnostic framework that combines data-free input
synthesis and statistical score computation for detecting distillation. Our
approach is applicable to both classification and generative models.
Experiments on diverse architectures for image classification and text-to-image
generation show that our method improves detection accuracy over the strongest
baselines by 59.6% on CIFAR-10, 71.2% on ImageNet, and 20.0% for text-to-image
generation. The code is available at

Motivation: 扩散模型在多个领域展现出卓越性能，但其成功机制尚不完全清楚。基于流形假设的领先猜想认为，这种成功源于模型适应数据低维几何结构的能力。

Method: 通过研究经验分数匹配目标最小化器的平滑效果来检查隐式正则化作用，分析分数函数平滑（或对数密度域平滑）如何产生沿数据流形的切向平滑。

Result: 理论和实证结果证实，平滑分数函数会产生沿数据流形的切向平滑，并且可以通过选择适当的平滑来控制扩散模型泛化的流形。

Conclusion: 该工作为扩散模型成功源于适应数据低维几何结构的猜想提供了有力证据，揭示了分数匹配中隐式正则化的几何机制。

Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved state-of-the-art performance, demonstrating
remarkable generalisation capabilities across diverse domains. However, the
mechanisms underpinning these strong capabilities remain only partially
understood. A leading conjecture, based on the manifold hypothesis, attributes
this success to their ability to adapt to low-dimensional geometric structure
within the data. This work provides evidence for this conjecture, focusing on
how such phenomena could result from the formulation of the learning problem
through score matching. We inspect the role of implicit regularisation by
investigating the effect of smoothing minimisers of the empirical score
matching objective. Our theoretical and empirical results confirm that
smoothing the score function -- or equivalently, smoothing in the log-density
domain -- produces smoothing tangential to the data manifold. In addition, we
show that the manifold along which the diffusion model generalises can be
controlled by choosing an appropriate smoothing.

TL;DR: 提出LEGO方法，利用图拉普拉斯低频特征向量的全局结构来指导局部切空间估计，解决了LPCA在高噪声环境下邻域大小选择的难题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准方法LPCA在高噪声环境下存在邻域大小选择的临界权衡问题，需要先验的几何和噪声特性知识，而这些信息通常不可得。

Method: LEGO通过正交化图拉普拉斯低频特征向量的梯度来估计每个数据点的切空间，利用数据的全局结构而非仅依赖局部邻域。

Result: 理论分析和实验表明，LEGO比LPCA对噪声更鲁棒，在流形学习、边界检测和局部本征维度估计等下游任务中表现显著提升。

Conclusion: LEGO方法通过利用全局结构信息，有效解决了高噪声环境下切空间估计的挑战，为数据流形分析提供了更鲁棒的解决方案。

Abstract: Estimating the tangent spaces of a data manifold is a fundamental problem in
data analysis. The standard approach, Local Principal Component Analysis
(LPCA), struggles in high-noise settings due to a critical trade-off in
choosing the neighborhood size. Selecting an optimal size requires prior
knowledge of the geometric and noise characteristics of the data that are often
unavailable. In this paper, we propose a spectral method, Laplacian Eigenvector
Gradient Orthogonalization (LEGO), that utilizes the global structure of the
data to guide local tangent space estimation. Instead of relying solely on
local neighborhoods, LEGO estimates the tangent space at each data point by
orthogonalizing the gradients of low-frequency eigenvectors of the graph
Laplacian. We provide two theoretical justifications of our method. First, a
differential geometric analysis on a tubular neighborhood of a manifold shows
that gradients of the low-frequency Laplacian eigenfunctions of the tube align
closely with the manifold's tangent bundle, while an eigenfunction with high
gradient in directions orthogonal to the manifold lie deeper in the spectrum.
Second, a random matrix theoretic analysis also demonstrates that low-frequency
eigenvectors are robust to sub-Gaussian noise. Through comprehensive
experiments, we demonstrate that LEGO yields tangent space estimates that are
significantly more robust to noise than those from LPCA, resulting in marked
improvements in downstream tasks such as manifold learning, boundary detection,
and local intrinsic dimension estimation.

Conclusion: 压缩KV缓存蒸馏为潜在推理提供了可扩展的监督信号，结合了思维链训练的准确性和潜在推理的效率与可部署性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at multi-step reasoning problems with
explicit chain-of-thought (CoT), but verbose traces incur significant
computational costs and memory overhead, and often carry redundant, stylistic
artifacts. Latent reasoning has emerged as an efficient alternative that
internalizes the thought process, but it suffers from a critical lack of
supervision, limiting its effectiveness on complex, natural-language reasoning
traces. In this work, we propose KaVa, the first framework that bridges this
gap by distilling knowledge directly from a compressed KV-cache of the teacher
into a latent-reasoning student via self-distillation, leveraging the
representational flexibility of continuous latent tokens to align stepwise KV
trajectories. We show that the abstract, unstructured knowledge within
compressed KV-cache, which lacks direct token correspondence, can serve as a
rich supervisory signal for a latent reasoning student. Empirically, the
approach consistently outperforms strong latent baselines, exhibits markedly
smaller degradation from equation-only to natural-language traces, and scales
to larger backbones while preserving efficiency. These results establish
compressed KV-cache distillation as a scalable supervision signal for latent
reasoning, combining the accuracy of CoT-trained teachers with the efficiency
and deployability of latent inference.
