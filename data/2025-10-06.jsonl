Drawing on recent work in\nphilosophy of neuroscience, we propose a comparison methodology based on the\nInter-Animal Transform Class (IATC) - the strictest set of functions needed to\naccurately map neural responses between subjects in an animal population. Using\nthe IATC, we can map bidirectionally between a candidate model's responses and\nbrain data, assessing how well the model can masquerade as a typical subject\nusing the same kinds of transforms needed to map across real subjects. We\nidentify the IATC in three settings: a simulated population of neural network\nmodels, a population of mouse subjects, and a population of human subjects. We\nfind that the IATC resolves detailed aspects of the neural mechanism, such as\nthe non-linear activation function. Most importantly, we find that the IATC\nenables accurate predictions of neural activity while also achieving high\nspecificity in mechanism identification, evidenced by its ability to separate\nresponse patterns from different brain areas while strongly aligning\nsame-brain-area responses between subjects. In other words, the IATC is a\nproof-by-existence that there is no inherent tradeoff between the neural\nengineering goal of high model-brain predictivity and the neuroscientific goal\nof identifying mechanistically accurate brain models.

Recent advances in\ncomputational neuroscience have shown that learning in standard gradient\ndescent optimization formulation is not consistent with learning in biological\nsystems.

One such approach is inspired by Dale's law,\nwhich states that inhibitory and excitatory synapses do not swap roles during\nthe course of learning. The resulting exponential gradient descent optimization\nscheme leads to log-normally distributed synaptic weights. Interestingly, the\ndensity that satisfies the Fokker-Planck equation corresponding to the\nstochastic differential equation (SDE) with geometric Brownian motion (GBM) is\nthe log-normal density.

In this work, we\nestablish optimal generalization rates for GD with deep ReLU networks by\ncarefully trading off optimization and generalization errors, achieving only\npolynomial dependence on depth. Specifically, under the assumption that the\ndata are NTK separable from the margin $\\gamma$, we prove an excess risk rate\nof $\\widetilde{O}(L^4 (1 + \\gamma L^2) / (n \\gamma^2))$, which aligns with the\noptimal SVM-type rate $\\widetilde{O}(1 / (n \\gamma^2))$ up to depth-dependent\nfactors. A key technical contribution is our novel control of activation\npatterns near a reference model, enabling a sharper Rademacher complexity bound\nfor deep ReLU networks trained with gradient descent."}

In particular, Conformal Prediction (CP) gains ground in\nthis field. For the case of time series, Online Conformal Prediction (OCP)\nbecomes an option to address the problem of data distribution shift over time.\nIndeed, the idea of OCP is to update a threshold of some quantity (whether the\nmiscoverage level or the quantile) based on the distribution observation. To\nevaluate the performance of OCP methods, two key aspects are typically\nconsidered: the coverage validity and the prediction interval width\nminimization. Recently, new OCP methods have emerged, offering long-run\ncoverage guarantees and producing more informative intervals. However, during\nthe threshold update step, most of these methods focus solely on the validity\nof the prediction intervals~--~that is, whether the ground truth falls inside\nor outside the interval~--~without accounting for their relevance. In this\npaper, we aim to leverage this overlooked aspect. Specifically, we propose\nenhancing the threshold update step by replacing the binary evaluation\n(inside/outside) with a broader class of functions that quantify the relevance\nof the prediction interval using the ground truth.

Specifically, we\nutilize a kernel calibration error estimator under the covariate shift and\nformally show that AL with this AF eventually leads to a bounded calibration\nerror on the unlabeled pool and unseen test data. Empirically, our proposed\nmethod surpasses other AF baselines by having a lower calibration and\ngeneralization error across pool-based AL settings."}

In this work, we provide a\nprincipled explanation for why warm-up improves training. We rely on a\ngeneralization of the $(L_0, L_1)$-smoothness condition, which bounds local\ncurvature as a linear function of the loss sub-optimality and exhibits\ndesirable closure properties. We demonstrate both theoretically and empirically\nthat this condition holds for common neural architectures trained with\nmean-squared error and cross-entropy losses. Under this assumption, we prove\nthat Gradient Descent with a warm-up schedule achieves faster convergence than\nwith a fixed step-size, establishing upper and lower complexity bounds.\nFinally, we validate our theoretical insights through experiments on language\nand vision models, confirming the practical benefits of warm-up schedules."}

Consequently,\nevaluations commonly report Pass@$k$: the agent may submit up to $k$ responses,\nand only the best of them is used when computing regret. Motivated by this, we\nstudy inference scaling in the more general Pass@$k$ inference setting, and\nprove that neither majority voting nor BoN exhibits the desirable scaling with\n$k$ and the sampling budget $N$. Combining the advantages of majority voting\nand BoN, we propose a new inference strategy called Best-of-Majority (BoM),\nwith a pivotal step that restricts the candidates to the responses with high\nfrequency in the $N$ samples before selecting the top-$k$ rewards. We prove\nthat when the sampling budget is $N=\\tilde\\Omega(C^*)$, the regret of BoM is\n$O(\\epsilon_{\\mathrm{opt}}+\\sqrt{\\epsilon_{\\mathrm{RM}}^2C^*/k})$, where $C^*$\nis the coverage coefficient, $\\epsilon_{\\mathrm{RM}}$ is the estimation error\nof the reward model, and $\\epsilon_{\\mathrm{opt}}$ is the estimation error of\nreward at the optimal response. We further establish a matching lower bound,\ncertifying that our algorithm is minimax optimal.

Recent\nempirical successes have used privileged expert distillation--which leverages\navailability of latent state information during training (e.g., from a\nsimulator) to learn and imitate the optimal latent, Markovian policy--to\ndisentangle the task of \"learning to see\" from \"learning to act\". While expert\ndistillation is more computationally efficient than RL without latent state\ninformation, it also has well-documented failure modes. In this paper--through\na simple but instructive theoretical model called the perturbed Block MDP, and\ncontrolled experiments on challenging simulated locomotion tasks--we\ninvestigate the algorithmic trade-off between privileged expert distillation\nand standard RL without privileged information. Our main findings are: (1) The\ntrade-off empirically hinges on the stochasticity of the latent dynamics, as\ntheoretically predicted by contrasting approximate decodability with belief\ncontraction in the perturbed Block MDP; and (2) The optimal latent policy is\nnot always the best latent policy to distill.

Previous methods typically address this by\nmaintaining high policy entropy, yet the precise mechanisms that govern\nmeaningful exploration have remained underexplored. Our analysis suggests that\nan unselective focus on entropy risks amplifying irrelevant tokens and\ndestabilizing training. This paper investigates the exploration dynamics within\nRLVR and identifies a key issue: the gradual elimination of valuable\nlow-probability exploratory tokens, which we term \\textbf{\\textit{reasoning\nsparks}}. We find that while abundant in pre-trained models, these sparks are\nsystematically extinguished during RLVR due to over-penalization, leading to a\ndegeneracy in exploration. To address this, we introduce Low-probability\nRegularization (Lp-Reg). Its core mechanism regularizes the policy towards a\nheuristic proxy distribution. This proxy is constructed by filtering out\npresumed noise tokens and re-normalizing the distribution over the remaining\ncandidates. The result is a less-noisy proxy where the probability of\n\\textit{reasoning sparks} is amplified, which then serves as a soft\nregularization target to shield these valuable tokens from elimination via KL\ndivergence. Experiments show that Lp-Reg enables stable on-policy training for\naround 1,000 steps, a regime where baseline entropy-control methods collapse.\nThis sustained exploration leads to state-of-the-art performance, achieving a\n$60.17\\%$ average accuracy on five math benchmarks, an improvement of $2.66\\%$\nover prior methods.
