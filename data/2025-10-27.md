### [1] [xMem: A CPU-Based Approach for Accurate Estimation of GPU Memory in Deep Learning Training Workloads](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21048)
*Jiabo Shi,Dimitrios Pezaros,Yehia Elkhatib*

Main category: cs.PF

TL;DR: xMem是一个通过CPU动态分析来准确预估GPU内存峰值需求的框架，相比现有方法将中位数相对误差降低了91%，显著提高了内存利用率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GPU资源稀缺需要更智能的深度学习作业调度策略，现有内存预估方法无法准确捕捉运行时动态且消耗GPU资源，需要非侵入式的精确内存需求预估方案。

Method: 提出xMem框架，利用仅CPU的动态分析来预估GPU内存峰值需求，无需消耗GPU资源且无需代码修改。

Result: 在25种不同模型的5209次运行评估中，xMem将中位数相对误差降低91%，安全OOM阈值失败概率减少75%，内存节省潜力提升368%。

Conclusion: xMem通过CPU动态分析实现了准确的非侵入式GPU内存预估，显著提升了集群环境中的GPU资源利用效率。

Abstract: The global scarcity of GPUs necessitates more sophisticated strategies for
Deep Learning jobs in shared cluster environments. Accurate estimation of how
much GPU memory a job will require is fundamental to enabling advanced
scheduling and GPU sharing, which helps prevent out-of-memory (OOM) errors and
resource underutilization. However, existing estimation methods have
limitations. Approaches relying on static analysis or historical data with
machine learning often fail to accurately capture runtime dynamics.
Furthermore, direct GPU analysis consumes scarce resources, and some techniques
require intrusive code modifications. Thus, the key challenge lies in precisely
estimating dynamic memory requirements, including memory allocator nuances,
without consuming GPU resources and non-intrusive code changes. To address this
challenge, we propose xMem, a novel framework that leverages CPU-only dynamic
analysis to accurately estimate peak GPU memory requirements a priori. We
conducted a thorough evaluation of xMem against state-of-the-art solutions
using workloads from 25 different models, including architectures like
Convolutional Neural Networks and Transformers. The analysis of 5209 runs,
which includes ANOVA and Monte Carlo results, highlights xMem's benefits: it
decreases the median relative error by 91% and significantly reduces the
probability of estimation failure as safe OOM thresholds by 75%, meaning that
the estimated value can often be used directly without causing OOM. Ultimately,
these improvements lead to a 368% increase in memory conservation potential
over current solutions.

### [2] [FIFOAdvisor: A DSE Framework for Automated FIFO Sizing of High-Level Synthesis Designs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20981)
*Stefan Abi-Karam,Rishov Sarkar,Suhail Basalama,Jason Cong,Callie Hao*

Main category: cs.AR

TL;DR: FIFOAdvisor是一个自动确定HLS设计中FIFO大小的框架，通过高精度模拟和优化算法，在保证无死锁的同时实现延迟和内存使用的权衡优化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 数据流硬件设计中，正确设置FIFO通道缓冲区大小具有挑战性：过小的FIFO会导致停顿和死锁，过大的FIFO会浪费内存。现有方法存在假设限制、保守分配或模拟速度慢的问题。

Method: 利用LightningSim（99.9%周期精度模拟器）进行毫秒级增量运行，将FIFO大小确定构建为双目标黑盒优化问题，探索启发式和基于搜索的方法来表征延迟-资源权衡。

Result: 在Stream-HLS设计基准测试中，FIFOAdvisor实现了Pareto最优的延迟-内存边界，相比基线设计显著降低内存使用且延迟开销最小，相比传统HLS/RTL协同模拟大幅提升运行速度。

Conclusion: FIFOAdvisor为数据依赖设计提供了实用的快速设计空间探索能力，能够有效优化复杂加速器中的数据相关控制流。

Abstract: Dataflow hardware designs enable efficient FPGA implementations via
high-level synthesis (HLS), but correctly sizing first-in-first-out (FIFO)
channel buffers remains challenging. FIFO sizes are user-defined and balance
latency and area-undersized FIFOs cause stalls and potential deadlocks, while
oversized ones waste memory. Determining optimal sizes is non-trivial: existing
methods rely on restrictive assumptions, conservative over-allocation, or slow
RTL simulations. We emphasize that runtime-based analyses (i.e., simulation)
are the only reliable way to ensure deadlock-free FIFO optimization for
data-dependent designs.
  We present FIFOAdvisor, a framework that automatically determines FIFO sizes
in HLS designs. It leverages LightningSim, a 99.9\% cycle-accurate simulator
supporting millisecond-scale incremental runs with new FIFO configurations.
FIFO sizing is formulated as a dual-objective black-box optimization problem,
and we explore heuristic and search-based methods to characterize the
latency-resource trade-off. FIFOAdvisor also integrates with Stream-HLS, a
framework for optimizing affine dataflow designs lowered from C++, MLIR, or
PyTorch, enabling deeper optimization of FIFOs in these workloads.
  We evaluate FIFOAdvisor on Stream-HLS design benchmarks spanning linear
algebra and deep learning workloads. Our results reveal Pareto-optimal
latency-memory frontiers across optimization strategies. Compared to baseline
designs, FIFOAdvisor achieves much lower memory usage with minimal delay
overhead. Additionally, it delivers significant runtime speedups over
traditional HLS/RTL co-simulation, making it practical for rapid design space
exploration. We further demonstrate its capability on a complex accelerator
with data-dependent control flow.

Method: 通过重新组织映射到LUT的逻辑函数，提出仅使用11个LUT和两个CARRY4模块的4位乘法器设计。

Result: 评估确认该电路实现了最小资源使用和2.750 ns的关键路径延迟，相比之前的12-LUT设计减少了一个LUT并缩短了关键路径。

Conclusion: 该设计在AMD Xilinx 7系列FPGA上实现了硬件高效的4位乘法器，在资源使用和延迟方面都有显著改进。

Abstract: As IoT and edge inference proliferate,there is a growing need to
simultaneously optimize area and delay in lookup-table (LUT)-based multipliers
that implement large numbers of low-bitwidth operations in parallel. This paper
proposes a hardwareefficientaccurate 4-bit multiplier design for AMD Xilinx
7-series FPGAs using only 11 LUTs and two CARRY4 blocks. By reorganizing the
logic functions mapped to the LUTs, the proposed method reduces the LUT count
by one compared with the prior 12-LUT design while also shortening the critical
path. Evaluation confirms that the circuit attains minimal resource usage and a
critical-path delay of 2.750 ns.

### [5] [Accelerating Mobile Inference through Fine-Grained CPU-GPU Co-Execution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21081)
*Zhuojin Li,Marco Paolieri,Leana Golubchik*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种在移动设备上通过CPU-GPU协同执行来加速深度神经网络推理的方法，包括轻量级同步机制和机器学习执行时间预测模型，在Pixel 5手机上实现接近理论最大值的加速效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 移动设备计算资源有限，但其统一内存架构和CPU-GPU性能差距缩小为协同执行提供了机会，主要挑战是同步开销和执行时间预测困难。

Method: 使用基于OpenCL细粒度共享虚拟内存的轻量级同步机制，以及机器学习模型来准确预测CPU和GPU任务的执行时间，包括GPU内核的性能特征和调度时间。

Result: 在四个移动平台上评估，线性层加速比达1.89倍，卷积层加速比达1.75倍，接近通过穷举搜索找到的理论最大值（分别为2.01倍和1.87倍）。

Conclusion: 提出的方法能够快速选择CPU-GPU协同执行策略，在移动设备上实现接近理论极限的推理加速效果。

Abstract: Deploying deep neural networks on mobile devices is increasingly important
but remains challenging due to limited computing resources. On the other hand,
their unified memory architecture and narrower gap between CPU and GPU
performance provide an opportunity to reduce inference latency by assigning
tasks to both CPU and GPU. The main obstacles for such collaborative execution
are the significant synchronization overhead required to combine partial
results, and the difficulty of predicting execution times of tasks assigned to
CPU and GPU (due to the dynamic selection of implementations and parallelism
level). To overcome these obstacles, we propose both a lightweight
synchronization mechanism based on OpenCL fine-grained shared virtual memory
(SVM) and machine learning models to accurately predict execution times.
Notably, these models capture the performance characteristics of GPU kernels
and account for their dispatch times. A comprehensive evaluation on four mobile
platforms shows that our approach can quickly select CPU-GPU co-execution
strategies achieving up to 1.89x speedup for linear layers and 1.75x speedup
for convolutional layers (close to the achievable maximum values of 2.01x and
1.87x, respectively, found by exhaustive grid search on a Pixel~5 smartphone).

### [6] [Incentivizing Consistent, Effective and Scalable Reasoning Capability in Audio LLMs via Reasoning Process Rewards](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20867)
*Jiajun Fan,Roger Ren,Jingyuan Li,Rahul Pandey,Prashanth Gurunath Shivakumar,Ivan Bulyko,Ankur Gandhe,Ge Liu,Yile Gu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CESAR通过在线强化学习框架解决音频大语言模型中的推理逆缩放问题，通过奖励推理过程而非结果验证，在MMAU Test-mini上达到SOTA性能，接近人类水平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 音频大语言模型中的推理能力未被充分探索，推理过程在推理时反而会降低性能，出现测试时逆缩放现象。

Method: 提出CESAR框架，采用在线强化学习和Group Relative Policy Optimization，通过多维度奖励机制激励正确性、格式、一致性、结构化分析模式、因果推理、领域知识整合和校准推理深度。

Result: 解决了测试时逆缩放问题，在MMAU Test-mini上大幅超越Gemini 2.5 Pro和GPT-4o Audio，在MMSU推理任务上接近人类水平，同时提升多模态推理和感知能力。

Conclusion: CESAR为开发音频大语言模型中稳健可扩展的推理能力建立了原则性方法。

Abstract: The role of reasoning in Audio Large Language Models remains widely
underexplored, as introducing a reasoning process often degrades rather than
improves performance during inference, a phenomenon we term test-time inverse
scaling, where longer reasoning chains yield progressively worse results. We
demonstrate that this stems not from fundamental limitations of reasoning
itself, but from inadequate training: models without proper guidance for the
reasoning process produce hallucinatory, inconsistent reasoning that
accumulates errors over longer chains. To address these challenges, we
introduce CESAR (Consistent, Effective, and Scalable Audio Reasoners), shifting
from outcome verification to rewarding the reasoning process. Our online
reinforcement learning framework employs Group Relative Policy Optimization
with a multi-faceted reward suite that incentivizes not only correctness and
format but also consistency, structured analytical patterns, causal reasoning,
domain-knowledge integration, and calibrated reasoning depth. CESAR resolves
test-time inverse scaling, transforming reasoning from detriments into gains
while revealing model-specific ``reasoning sweet spots", where performance
peaks during test-time scaling. We achieve state-of-the-art results on MMAU
Test-mini, substantially outperforming Gemini 2.5 Pro and GPT-4o Audio, and
near-human-level performance on MMSU reasoning tasks. Through AI-as-judge
evaluations and qualitative comparisons, we provide both quantitative and
qualitative validation of our improved reasoning quality. Importantly, enhanced
reasoning creates synergistic effects, simultaneously improving multimodal
reasoning and perception capabilities. Overall, CESAR establishes a principled
method for developing robust and scalable reasoning in Audio LLMs.

### [7] [Crisis-Resilient Portfolio Management via Graph-based Spatio-Temporal Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20868)
*Zan Li,Rui Fan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CRISP是一个基于图时空学习的危机弹性投资框架，通过自适应图注意力机制发现危机相关的资产关系，在通胀驱动市场等不同危机机制下实现稳健的资产配置预测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于图的时空学习方法依赖预定义的图拓扑结构，无法适应不同危机机制（信用传染、疫情冲击、通胀抛售）下市场动态的变化，导致资产相关性结构预测不准确。

Method: 使用图卷积网络编码空间关系，BiLSTM与自注意力机制编码时间动态，通过多头图注意力网络学习稀疏结构，过滤92.5%的噪声连接，保留危机相关的依赖关系。

Result: 在2005-2021年数据上训练，在2022-2024年通胀驱动市场中表现出稳健泛化能力，夏普比率达到3.76，相比等权重基准提升707%，比静态图方法提升94%。

Conclusion: CRISP通过自适应学习而非强加假设，能够准确预测特定机制下的相关性结构，提供可解释的机制检测，在危机期间实现盈利性资产配置。

Abstract: Financial time series forecasting faces a fundamental challenge: predicting
optimal asset allocations requires understanding regime-dependent correlation
structures that transform during crisis periods. Existing graph-based
spatio-temporal learning approaches rely on predetermined graph
topologies--correlation thresholds, sector classifications--that fail to adapt
when market dynamics shift across different crisis mechanisms: credit
contagion, pandemic shocks, or inflation-driven selloffs.
  We present CRISP (Crisis-Resilient Investment through Spatio-temporal
Patterns), a graph-based spatio-temporal learning framework that encodes
spatial relationships via Graph Convolutional Networks and temporal dynamics
via BiLSTM with self-attention, then learns sparse structures through
multi-head Graph Attention Networks. Unlike fixed-topology methods, CRISP
discovers which asset relationships matter through attention mechanisms,
filtering 92.5% of connections as noise while preserving crisis-relevant
dependencies for accurate regime-specific predictions.
  Trained on 2005--2021 data encompassing credit and pandemic crises, CRISP
demonstrates robust generalization to 2022--2024 inflation-driven markets--a
fundamentally different regime--by accurately forecasting regime-appropriate
correlation structures. This enables adaptive portfolio allocation that
maintains profitability during downturns, achieving Sharpe ratio 3.76: 707%
improvement over equal-weight baselines and 94% improvement over static graph
methods. Learned attention weights provide interpretable regime detection, with
defensive cluster attention strengthening 49% during crises versus 31%
market-wide--emergent behavior from learning to forecast rather than imposing
assumptions.

### [8] [MOBO-OSD: Batch Multi-Objective Bayesian Optimization via Orthogonal Search Directions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20872)
*Lam Ngo,Huong Ha,Jeffrey Chan,Hongyu Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MOBO-OSD是一种多目标贝叶斯优化算法，通过沿正交搜索方向求解多个约束优化问题来生成多样化的帕累托最优解，在2-6目标问题上优于现有算法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Conclusion: MOBO-OSD通过正交搜索方向和帕累托前沿估计，有效提高了多目标贝叶斯优化的解多样性和超体积性能。

Abstract: Bayesian Optimization (BO) is a powerful tool for optimizing expensive
black-box objective functions. While extensive research has been conducted on
the single-objective optimization problem, the multi-objective optimization
problem remains challenging. In this paper, we propose MOBO-OSD, a
multi-objective Bayesian Optimization algorithm designed to generate a diverse
set of Pareto optimal solutions by solving multiple constrained optimization
problems, referred to as MOBO-OSD subproblems, along orthogonal search
directions (OSDs) defined with respect to an approximated convex hull of
individual objective minima. By employing a well-distributed set of OSDs,
MOBO-OSD ensures broad coverage of the objective space, enhancing both solution
diversity and hypervolume performance. To further improve the density of the
set of Pareto optimal candidate solutions without requiring an excessive number
of subproblems, we leverage a Pareto Front Estimation technique to generate
additional solutions in the neighborhood of existing solutions. Additionally,
MOBO-OSD supports batch optimization, enabling parallel function evaluations to
accelerate the optimization process when resources are available. Through
extensive experiments and analysis on a variety of synthetic and real-world
benchmark functions with two to six objectives, we demonstrate that MOBO-OSD
consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art algorithms. Our code
implementation can be found at https://github.com/LamNgo1/mobo-osd.

Abstract: Landslides are a growing climate induced hazard with severe environmental and
human consequences, particularly in high mountain Asia. Despite increasing
access to satellite and temporal datasets, timely detection and disaster
response remain underdeveloped and fragmented. This work introduces CC-GRMAS, a
framework leveraging a series of satellite observations and environmental
signals to enhance the accuracy of landslide forecasting. The system is
structured around three interlinked agents Prediction, Planning, and Execution,
which collaboratively enable real time situational awareness, response
planning, and intervention. By incorporating local environmental factors and
operationalizing multi agent coordination, this approach offers a scalable and
proactive solution for climate resilient disaster preparedness across
vulnerable mountainous terrains.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的多模态学习范式"负学习"，通过让主导模态引导弱模态抑制非目标类别，而不是强制对齐，从而解决模态不平衡问题并保留模态特有信息。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统多模态学习方法存在模态不平衡问题，主导模态会压制弱模态的学习，强制对齐会抑制弱模态的独特信息。

Method: 提出多模态负学习框架，主导模态动态引导弱模态抑制非目标类别，稳定决策空间并保留模态特有信息。

Result: 理论证明该方法能收紧多模态学习的鲁棒性下界，提高单模态置信度边界，在噪声和不平衡场景下显著降低弱模态的实证误差。

Conclusion: 负学习范式能有效解决模态不平衡问题，保留弱模态的独特信息，在多个基准测试中表现出优越性能和泛化能力。

Abstract: Multimodal learning systems often encounter challenges related to modality
imbalance, where a dominant modality may overshadow others, thereby hindering
the learning of weak modalities. Conventional approaches often force weak
modalities to align with dominant ones in "Learning to be (the same)" (Positive
Learning), which risks suppressing the unique information inherent in the weak
modalities. To address this challenge, we offer a new learning paradigm:
"Learning Not to be" (Negative Learning). Instead of enhancing weak modalities'
target-class predictions, the dominant modalities dynamically guide the weak
modality to suppress non-target classes. This stabilizes the decision space and
preserves modality-specific information, allowing weak modalities to preserve
unique information without being over-aligned. We proceed to reveal multimodal
learning from a robustness perspective and theoretically derive the Multimodal
Negative Learning (MNL) framework, which introduces a dynamic guidance
mechanism tailored for negative learning. Our method provably tightens the
robustness lower bound of multimodal learning by increasing the Unimodal
Confidence Margin (UCoM) and reduces the empirical error of weak modalities,
particularly under noisy and imbalanced scenarios. Extensive experiments across
multiple benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and generalizability of our
approach against competing methods. The code will be available at
https://github.com/BaoquanGong/Multimodal-Negative-Learning.git.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了基于访问热度的RAG推理优化系统HA-RAG，通过混合精度压缩加载和热点数据放置策略，显著提升推理速度，在TTFT指标上平均加速2.10倍，最大加速10.49倍。


<details>

Conclusion: HA-RAG系统通过热度感知的优化策略，有效解决了RAG推理中的性能瓶颈，在保持准确性的同时显著提升了推理效率。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) improves model output accuracy by
leveraging external knowledge bases, serving as an effective solution to
address hallucination issues and knowledge-update delays in Large Language
Models (LLMs). However, the introduction of external knowledge bases presents
RAG with challenges in long-context processing, significantly increasing memory
consumption and inference latency. Existing research accelerates inference by
precomputing Key and Value (KV) of the knowledge base and loading them
on-demand during inference. Based on the access frequency of different KV
chunks within the external knowledge base, this paper proposes a hotness-aware
RAG (HA-RAG) inference optimization system. First, leveraging the numerical
distribution of KV chunks, we introduce a hotness-aware mixed-precision
compressing and loading method to reduce disk I/O and memory access overhead.
Second, we design a hotness-aware data placement strategy that prioritizes
storing frequently accessed KV chunks in high-speed memory to improve data
access efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate that, compared with
TurboRAG, the proposed HA-RAG achieves an average speedup of 2.10x and maximum
speedup of 10.49x in Time-To-First-Token (TTFT) with negligible accuracy loss.

Result: 重尾SGD能够找到几何形状更平坦的局部极小值，在测试数据上获得更好的泛化性能。

Conclusion: 重尾噪声注入与截断是提升SGD泛化能力的有效策略，理论和实验均证实了其优势。

Abstract: Stochastic gradient descent (SGD) and its variants enable modern artificial
intelligence. However, theoretical understanding lags far behind their
empirical success. It is widely believed that SGD has a curious ability to
avoid sharp local minima in the loss landscape, which are associated with poor
generalization. To unravel this mystery and further enhance such capability of
SGDs, it is imperative to go beyond the traditional local convergence analysis
and obtain a comprehensive understanding of SGDs' global dynamics. In this
paper, we develop a set of technical machinery based on the recent large
deviations and metastability analysis in Wang and Rhee (2023) and obtain sharp
characterization of the global dynamics of heavy-tailed SGDs. In particular, we
reveal a fascinating phenomenon in deep learning: by injecting and then
truncating heavy-tailed noises during the training phase, SGD can almost
completely avoid sharp minima and achieve better generalization performance for
the test data. Simulation and deep learning experiments confirm our theoretical
prediction that heavy-tailed SGD with gradient clipping finds local minima with
a more flat geometry and achieves better generalization performance.

Conclusion: 所提出的区间目标回归方法有效解决了精确标签不可得情况下的回归问题，通过理论分析和实验验证了其优越性能。

Abstract: We study the problem of regression with interval targets, where only upper
and lower bounds on target values are available in the form of intervals. This
problem arises when the exact target label is expensive or impossible to
obtain, due to inherent uncertainties. In the absence of exact targets,
traditional regression loss functions cannot be used. First, we study the
methodology of using a loss functions compatible with interval targets, for
which we establish non-asymptotic generalization bounds based on smoothness of
the hypothesis class that significantly relaxing prior assumptions of
realizability and small ambiguity degree. Second, we propose a novel min-max
learning formulation: minimize against the worst-case (maximized) target labels
within the provided intervals. The maximization problem in the latter is
non-convex, but we show that good performance can be achieved with the
incorporation of smoothness constraints. Finally, we perform extensive
experiments on real-world datasets and show that our methods achieve
state-of-the-art performance.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文提出了基于元学习的蛋白质突变特性预测方法，通过模型无关元学习和新型突变编码策略，显著提升了跨数据集泛化能力和训练效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖针对单个数据集的蛋白质特定transformer微调，但由于实验条件异质性和目标域数据有限，在跨数据集泛化方面表现不佳。

Method: 采用模型无关元学习和新型突变编码策略，使用分隔符标记将突变直接整合到序列上下文中，避免标准transformer将突变位置视为未知标记的问题。

Abstract: Protein mutations can have profound effects on biological function, making
accurate prediction of property changes critical for drug discovery, protein
engineering, and precision medicine. Current approaches rely on fine-tuning
protein-specific transformers for individual datasets, but struggle with
cross-dataset generalization due to heterogeneous experimental conditions and
limited target domain data. We introduce two key innovations: (1) the first
application of Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML) to protein mutation property
prediction, and (2) a novel mutation encoding strategy using separator tokens
to directly incorporate mutations into sequence context. We build upon
transformer architectures integrating them with MAML to enable rapid adaptation
to new tasks through minimal gradient steps rather than learning
dataset-specific patterns. Our mutation encoding addresses the critical
limitation where standard transformers treat mutation positions as unknown
tokens, significantly degrading performance. Evaluation across three diverse
protein mutation datasets (functional fitness, thermal stability, and
solubility) demonstrates significant advantages over traditional fine-tuning.
In cross-task evaluation, our meta-learning approach achieves 29% better
accuracy for functional fitness with 65% less training time, and 94% better
accuracy for solubility with 55% faster training. The framework maintains
consistent training efficiency regardless of dataset size, making it
particularly valuable for industrial applications and early-stage protein
design where experimental data is limited. This work establishes a systematic
application of meta-learning to protein mutation analysis and introduces an
effective mutation encoding strategy, offering transformative methodology for
cross-domain generalization in protein engineering.

*Sungjun Cho,Changho Shin,Suenggwan Jo,Xinya Yan,Shourjo Aditya Chaudhuri,Frederic Sala*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出LLM集成贝叶斯状态空间模型(LBS)，结合状态空间模型和大型语言模型，实现多模态时间序列预测，支持灵活的时间窗口和不确定性量化


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现实世界预测中需要整合结构化时间序列数据和非结构化文本信息的问题，现有方法在输入/输出时间范围固定且无法建模不确定性方面存在局限

Method: LBS包含两个组件：(1)状态空间模型(SSM)主干捕捉潜在状态的时间动态，(2)预训练LLM编码文本输入进行后验状态估计，并解码与潜在轨迹一致的文本预测

Result: 在TextTimeCorpus基准测试中，LBS将先前最先进方法提升了13.20%，同时提供人类可读的预测摘要

Conclusion: 这是首个统一LLM和SSM进行联合数值和文本预测的工作，为多模态时间推理提供了新的基础

Abstract: Forecasting in the real world requires integrating structured time-series
data with unstructured textual information, but existing methods are
architecturally limited by fixed input/output horizons and are unable to model
or quantify uncertainty. We address this challenge by introducing
LLM-integrated Bayesian State space models (LBS), a novel probabilistic
framework for multimodal temporal forecasting. At a high level, LBS consists of
two components: (1) a state space model (SSM) backbone that captures the
temporal dynamics of latent states from which both numerical and textual
observations are generated and (2) a pretrained large language model (LLM) that
is adapted to encode textual inputs for posterior state estimation and decode
textual forecasts consistent with the latent trajectory. This design enables
flexible lookback and forecast windows, principled uncertainty quantification,
and improved temporal generalization thanks to the well-suited inductive bias
of SSMs toward modeling dynamical systems. Experiments on the TextTimeCorpus
benchmark demonstrate that LBS improves the previous state-of-the-art by 13.20%
while providing human-readable summaries of each forecast. Our work is the
first to unify LLMs and SSMs for joint numerical and textual prediction,
offering a novel foundation for multimodal temporal reasoning.

*Jeff Pflueger,Michael Everett*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出一种基于可逆性的模型自由强化学习方法，通过模型预测路径积分控制检查学习策略的安全性，无需显式动态模型或安全约束知识


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 模型自由强化学习缺乏形式化安全保证，现有方法需要详细安全规范知识，而许多难以规范的安全问题本质上是保持不变性的问题

Method: 利用可逆性作为防止安全问题的机制，使用模型预测路径积分控制在整个训练过程中检查学习策略提出的动作安全性

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在所有不安全动作发生前成功中止，同时训练进度与允许违反安全的基线PPO方法相当

Conclusion: 基于可逆性的方法能够有效提供安全保证，仅需查询黑盒动态，无需显式动态模型或安全约束知识

Abstract: Model-free reinforcement learning approaches are promising for control but
typically lack formal safety guarantees. Existing methods to shield or
otherwise provide these guarantees often rely on detailed knowledge of the
safety specifications. Instead, this work's insight is that many
difficult-to-specify safety issues are best characterized by invariance.
Accordingly, we propose to leverage reversibility as a method for preventing
these safety issues throughout the training process. Our method uses
model-predictive path integral control to check the safety of an action
proposed by a learned policy throughout training. A key advantage of this
approach is that it only requires the ability to query the black-box dynamics,
not explicit knowledge of the dynamics or safety constraints. Experimental
results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm successfully aborts before all
unsafe actions, while still achieving comparable training progress to a
baseline PPO approach that is allowed to violate safety.

Conclusion: 为医疗环境中的跌倒检测提供了可扩展、安全且准确的解决方案，具有通过自适应反馈机制持续改进的潜力

Abstract: Falls among elderly and disabled individuals remain a leading cause of injury
and mortality worldwide, necessitating robust, accurate, and privacy-aware fall
detection systems. Traditional fall detection approaches, whether centralized
or point-wise, often struggle with key challenges such as limited
generalizability, data privacy concerns, and variability in individual movement
behaviors. To address these limitations, we propose EPFL-an Ensembled Penalized
Federated Learning framework that integrates continual learning, personalized
modeling, and a novel Specialized Weighted Aggregation (SWA) strategy. EPFL
leverages wearable sensor data to capture sequential motion patterns while
preserving user privacy through homomorphic encryption and federated training.
Unlike existing federated models, EPFL incorporates both penalized local
training and ensemble-based inference to improve inter-client consistency and
adaptability to behavioral differences. Extensive experiments on a benchmark
fall detection dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, achieving
a Recall of 88.31 percent and an F1-score of 89.94 percent, significantly
outperforming both centralized and baseline models. This work presents a
scalable, secure, and accurate solution for real-world fall detection in
healthcare settings, with strong potential for continuous improvement via its
adaptive feedback mechanism.

Abstract: Catastrophic forgetting (CF) poses a persistent challenge in continual
learning (CL), especially within federated learning (FL) environments
characterized by non-i.i.d. time series data. While existing research has
largely focused on classification tasks in vision domains, the regression-based
forecasting setting prevalent in IoT and edge applications remains
underexplored. In this paper, we present the first benchmarking framework
tailored to investigate CF in federated continual time series forecasting.
Using the Beijing Multi-site Air Quality dataset across 12 decentralized
clients, we systematically evaluate several CF mitigation strategies, including
Replay, Elastic Weight Consolidation, Learning without Forgetting, and Synaptic
Intelligence. Key contributions include: (i) introducing a new benchmark for CF
in time series FL, (ii) conducting a comprehensive comparative analysis of
state-of-the-art methods, and (iii) releasing a reproducible open-source
framework. This work provides essential tools and insights for advancing
continual learning in federated time-series forecasting systems.

TL;DR: 提出ColMAD协作多智能体辩论协议，将辩论重构为非零和博弈，通过相互支持性批评来提升大语言模型错误检测能力，相比竞争性方法提升19%


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多智能体辩论协议将辩论视为零和博弈，导致辩论黑客行为——辩论者通过误导法官来获胜而非寻求真相，反而引入更多错误

Method: ColMAD协议鼓励多个智能体以支持性方式相互批评，补充彼此的缺失点，使法官智能体能够基于更全面的证据做出更明智的结论

Result: ColMAD显著优于先前竞争性多智能体辩论方法19%，并在错误检测方面相比单智能体方法带来非平凡改进

Conclusion: 协作性多智能体辩论协议能有效缓解辩论黑客问题，通过非零和博弈框架提升大语言模型错误检测的准确性和可靠性

Abstract: Accurate detection of errors in large language models (LLM) responses is
central to the success of scalable oversight, or providing effective
supervision to superhuman intelligence. Yet, self-diagnosis is often unreliable
on complex tasks unless aided by reliable external feedback. Multi-agent debate
(MAD) seems to be a natural alternative to external feedback: multiple LLMs
provide complementary perspectives and cross-checks for error detection.
However, prior MAD protocols frame debate as a zero-sum game, where the
debaters compete to win the game instead of seeking the truth. Consequently, it
leads to debate hacking: debaters tend to mislead the judge by misinterpreting
the task or presenting overconfident claims, which introduce more mistakes and
underperform single-agent methods. To mitigate the issue, we introduce a new
collaborative MAD protocol, termed ColMAD, that reframes MAD as a non-zero sum
game. Specifically, ColMAD encourages multiple agents to criticize each other
in a supportive way, such that they can complement the missing points of each
other. Therefore, the judge agent can make a more informative conclusion based
on more comprehensive evidence. Empirically, we show that ColMAD significantly
outperforms previous competitive MAD by 19% and brings non-trivial improvements
over single-agent methods in error detection.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有互信息估计方法要么依赖需要大量数据的复杂模型（如神经网络），要么使用过于简化的模型（如高斯copula），无法有效处理复杂分布

Method: 基于最新的向量copula理论，在两种极端方法之间进行原则性插值

Result: 在先进合成基准测试和多种模态的真实世界数据上的实验证明了所提估计器的优势

Conclusion: 该方法在模型复杂度和容量之间实现了更好的权衡，在多种数据模态下都表现出优越性能

Abstract: Estimating mutual information (MI) is a fundamental task in data science and
machine learning. Existing estimators mainly rely on either highly flexible
models (e.g., neural networks), which require large amounts of data, or overly
simplified models (e.g., Gaussian copula), which fail to capture complex
distributions. Drawing upon recent vector copula theory, we propose a
principled interpolation between these two extremes to achieve a better
trade-off between complexity and capacity. Experiments on state-of-the-art
synthetic benchmarks and real-world data with diverse modalities demonstrate
the advantages of the proposed estimator.

TL;DR: 本文评估了隐式神经表示(INRs)在血流动力学场压缩和心血管解剖表示中的性能，通过多种策略缓解频谱偏差，实现了高达230的压缩比和毫米级的精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 隐式神经表示虽然具有分辨率独立性和高内存效率，但在特定领域应用中的准确性尚未充分了解，需要评估其在血流动力学场压缩和解剖表示中的性能。

Method: 研究了多种缓解频谱偏差的策略，包括专用激活函数、固定和可训练位置编码、非线性核的线性组合，在胸主动脉血流动力学场和48个胸主动脉解剖结构上进行测试。

Result: INRs实现了约230的压缩比，压力最大绝对误差1 mmHg，速度误差5-10 cm/s；解剖结构平均和最大绝对差异分别低于0.5 mm和1.6 mm。SIREN、MFN-Gabor和MHE架构表现最佳。

Conclusion: 隐式神经表示在血流动力学场压缩和心血管解剖表示中表现出色，实现了高压缩比和低误差，为医学图像和模拟数据的高效表示提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Implicit neural representations (INRs, also known as neural fields) have
recently emerged as a powerful framework for knowledge representation,
synthesis, and compression. By encoding fields as continuous functions within
the weights and biases of deep neural networks-rather than relying on voxel- or
mesh-based structured or unstructured representations-INRs offer both
resolution independence and high memory efficiency. However, their accuracy in
domain-specific applications remains insufficiently understood. In this work,
we assess the performance of state-of-the-art INRs for compressing hemodynamic
fields derived from numerical simulations and for representing cardiovascular
anatomies via signed distance functions. We investigate several strategies to
mitigate spectral bias, including specialized activation functions, both fixed
and trainable positional encoding, and linear combinations of nonlinear
kernels. On realistic, space- and time-varying hemodynamic fields in the
thoracic aorta, INRs achieved remarkable compression ratios of up to
approximately 230, with maximum absolute errors of 1 mmHg for pressure and 5-10
cm/s for velocity, without extensive hyperparameter tuning. Across 48 thoracic
aortic anatomies, the average and maximum absolute anatomical discrepancies
were below 0.5 mm and 1.6 mm, respectively. Overall, the SIREN, MFN-Gabor, and
MHE architectures demonstrated the best performance. Source code and data is

TL;DR: L2M3OF是首个用于MOF材料的多模态大语言模型，通过整合晶体结构表示学习和语言理解，在性能预测和知识生成任务中超越了仅基于文本的闭源LLM。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM在科学发现中的突破有限，因为理解复杂物理现象需要超越语言的多模态表示。MOF材料设计尤其困难，其三维原子排列和拓扑规则难以用语言表示，且依赖难以文本化的专家知识。

Method: L2M3OF整合了预训练的晶体编码器和轻量级投影层，将结构信息压缩到token空间，与语言指令对齐。构建了结构-属性-知识数据库进行训练和评估。

Result: 实验表明L2M3OF在性能预测和知识生成任务中超越了GPT-5、Gemini-2.5-Pro和DeepSeek-R1等最先进的闭源文本LLM，且参数量更少。

Conclusion: 多模态方法对于多孔材料理解至关重要，L2M3OF为下一代材料发现AI系统奠定了基础。

Abstract: Large language models have demonstrated remarkable reasoning capabilities
across diverse natural language tasks. However, comparable breakthroughs in
scientific discovery are more limited, because understanding complex physical
phenomena demands multifaceted representations far beyond language alone. A
compelling example is the design of functional materials such as MOFs-critical
for a range of impactful applications like carbon capture and hydrogen storage.
Navigating their vast and intricate design space in language-based
representations interpretable by LLMs is challenging due to the numerous
possible three-dimensional atomic arrangements and strict reticular rules of
coordination geometry and topology. Despite promising early results in
LLM-assisted discovery for simpler materials systems, MOF design remains
heavily reliant on tacit human expertise rarely codified in textual information
alone. To overcome this barrier, we introduce L2M3OF, the first multimodal LLM
for MOFs. L2M3OF integrates crystal representation learning with language
understanding to process structural, textual, and knowledge modalities jointly.
L2M3OF employs a pre-trained crystal encoder with a lightweight projection
layer to compress structural information into a token space, enabling efficient
alignment with language instructions. To facilitate training and evaluation, we
curate a structure-property-knowledge database of crystalline materials and
benchmark L2M3OF against state-of-the-art closed-source LLMs such as GPT-5,
Gemini-2.5-Pro and DeepSeek-R1. Experiments show that L2M3OF outperforms
leading text-based closed-source LLMs in property prediction and knowledge
generation tasks, despite using far fewer parameters. These results highlight
the importance of multimodal approaches for porous material understanding and
establish L2M3OF as a foundation for next-generation AI systems in materials
discovery.

Motivation: 设备端神经网络训练面临严重的内存限制，阻碍了预训练模型在下游任务上的适配。

Method: 提出LaRa（层排序）改进的层重要性度量方法，以及利用通道重要性分布时间稳定性的动态通道采样策略，在训练周期间根据重要性加权概率动态重采样通道。

Result: 在大量任务和架构上的广泛评估表明，MeDyate在极端内存约束下达到最先进性能，持续优于现有静态和动态方法，同时保持高计算效率。

Conclusion: 该方法通过展示在仅几百kB RAM内存预算下的有效微调，为实现高效设备端学习迈出了重要一步。

Abstract: On-device neural network training faces critical memory constraints that
limit the adaptation of pre-trained models to downstream tasks. We present
MeDyate, a theoretically-grounded framework for memory-constrained dynamic
subnetwork adaptation. Our approach introduces two key innovations: LaRa (Layer
Ranking), an improved layer importance metric that enables principled layer
pre-selection, and a dynamic channel sampling strategy that exploits the
temporal stability of channel importance distributions during fine-tuning.
MeDyate dynamically resamples channels between epochs according to
importance-weighted probabilities, ensuring comprehensive parameter space
exploration while respecting strict memory budgets. Extensive evaluation across
a large panel of tasks and architectures demonstrates that MeDyate achieves
state-of-the-art performance under extreme memory constraints, consistently
outperforming existing static and dynamic approaches while maintaining high
computational efficiency. Our method represents a significant step towards
enabling efficient on-device learning by demonstrating effective fine-tuning
with memory budgets as low as a few hundred kB of RAM.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型推理需要大量计算资源和内存，标准均匀量化在低比特场景下会导致显著的性能下降，需要更有效的量化方法来在严格资源约束下部署大模型。

Method: 使用分组格向量量化框架，为每组权重分配可学习生成矩阵定义的格码本，采用Babai舍入近似最近格点搜索来解决量化过程的不可微问题，训练后解码简化为矩阵向量乘法。

Conclusion: GLVQ框架通过定制化的格码本设计，为低比特量化提供了更优的解决方案，能够在大幅减小模型尺寸的同时保持较好的性能表现。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities but
typically require extensive computational resources and memory for inference.
Post-training quantization (PTQ) can effectively reduce these demands by
storing weights in lower bit-width formats. However, standard uniform
quantization often leads to notable performance degradation, particularly in
low-bit scenarios. In this work, we introduce a Grouped Lattice Vector
Quantization (GLVQ) framework that assigns each group of weights a customized
lattice codebook, defined by a learnable generation matrix. To address the
non-differentiability of the quantization process, we adopt Babai rounding to
approximate nearest-lattice-point search during training, which enables stable
optimization of the generation matrices. Once trained, decoding reduces to a
simple matrix-vector multiplication, yielding an efficient and practical
quantization pipeline. Experiments on multiple benchmarks show that our
approach achieves a better trade-off between model size and accuracy compared
to existing post-training quantization baselines, highlighting its
effectiveness in deploying large models under stringent resource constraints.

Abstract: In response to the increasingly critical demand for accurate prediction of
GPU memory resources in deep learning tasks, this paper deeply analyzes the
current research status and innovatively proposes a deep learning model that
integrates bidirectional gated recurrent units (BiGRU) to optimize the
Transformer architecture, aiming to improve the accuracy of memory demand
prediction. To verify the effectiveness of the model, a carefully designed
comparative experiment was conducted, selecting four representative basic
machine learning models: decision tree, random forest, Adaboost, and XGBoost as
benchmarks. The detailed experimental results show that the BiGRU Transformer
optimization model proposed in this paper exhibits significant advantages in
key evaluation indicators: in terms of mean square error (MSE) and root mean
square error (RMSE), the model achieves the lowest value among all comparison
models, and its predicted results have the smallest deviation from the actual
values; In terms of mean absolute error (MAE) and coefficient of determination
(R2) indicators, the model also performs well and the results are balanced and
stable, with comprehensive predictive performance far exceeding the benchmark
machine learning methods compared. In summary, the Transformer model based on
bidirectional gated recurrent unit optimization successfully constructed in
this study can efficiently and accurately complete GPU memory demand prediction
tasks in deep learning tasks, and its prediction accuracy has been
significantly improved compared to traditional machine learning methods. This
research provides strong technical support and reliable theoretical basis for
optimizing resource scheduling and management of deep learning tasks, and
improving the utilization efficiency of computing clusters.

Abstract: Despite the non-convexity of most modern machine learning parameterizations,
Lagrangian duality has become a popular tool for addressing constrained

mitigate the duality gap in non-convex settings while requiring only minimal

settings. We establish strong duality results under mild conditions, prove
convergence of dual ascent algorithms to feasible and optimal primal solutions,
and provide PAC-style generalization guarantees. Finally, we demonstrate its
effectiveness on fairness constrained classification tasks.

Motivation: 开发一个通用的SNN训练框架，能够在多元时间序列上进行二分类，特别关注逐步预测和在低误报率下实现高精度，同时降低计算复杂度和功耗。

Method: 使用EONS进化算法联合优化稀疏、有状态的SNNs架构和参数，将输入编码为脉冲序列，通过阈值化单个输出神经元的脉冲计数进行预测，并采用简单投票集成方法提高性能。

Result: 在放射性源检测任务中，仅49个神经元和66个突触的SNN实现了51.8%的真阳性率(误报率1/小时)，优于PCA(42.7%)和深度学习(49.8%)基线。三模型集成将真阳性率提升至67.1%。硬件部署功耗仅2mW，推理延迟20.2ms。在癫痫检测中，集成方法达到95%真阳性率和16%假阳性率。

Conclusion: 该框架能够训练出高效、低功耗的SNNs，在多个时间序列分类任务中表现出色，证明了其通用性和在边缘计算设备上的部署可行性。

Abstract: We present a general framework for training spiking neural networks (SNNs) to
perform binary classification on multivariate time series, with a focus on
step-wise prediction and high precision at low false alarm rates. The approach
uses the Evolutionary Optimization of Neuromorphic Systems (EONS) algorithm to
evolve sparse, stateful SNNs by jointly optimizing their architectures and
parameters. Inputs are encoded into spike trains, and predictions are made by
thresholding a single output neuron's spike counts. We also incorporate simple
voting ensemble methods to improve performance and robustness.
  To evaluate the framework, we apply it with application-specific
optimizations to the task of detecting low signal-to-noise ratio radioactive
sources in gamma-ray spectral data. The resulting SNNs, with as few as 49
neurons and 66 synapses, achieve a 51.8% true positive rate (TPR) at a false
alarm rate of 1/hr, outperforming PCA (42.7%) and deep learning (49.8%)
baselines. A three-model any-vote ensemble increases TPR to 67.1% at the same
false alarm rate. Hardware deployment on the microCaspian neuromorphic platform
demonstrates 2mW power consumption and 20.2ms inference latency.
  We also demonstrate generalizability by applying the same framework, without
domain-specific modification, to seizure detection in EEG recordings. An
ensemble achieves 95% TPR with a 16% false positive rate, comparable to recent
deep learning approaches with significant reduction in parameter count.

Abstract: Image Auto-regressive (AR) models have emerged as a powerful paradigm of

Although Distilled Decoding 1 (DD1) was recently proposed to enable few-step
sampling for image AR models, it still incurs significant performance
degradation in the one-step setting, and relies on a pre-defined mapping that
limits its flexibility. In this work, we propose a new method, Distilled
Decoding 2 (DD2), to further advances the feasibility of one-step sampling for
image AR models. Unlike DD1, DD2 does not without rely on a pre-defined
mapping. We view the original AR model as a teacher model which provides the
ground truth conditional score in the latent embedding space at each token
position. Based on this, we propose a novel \emph{conditional score
distillation loss} to train a one-step generator. Specifically, we train a
separate network to predict the conditional score of the generated distribution
and apply score distillation at every token position conditioned on previous
tokens. Experimental results show that DD2 enables one-step sampling for image
AR models with an minimal FID increase from 3.40 to 5.43 on ImageNet-256.
Compared to the strongest baseline DD1, DD2 reduces the gap between the
one-step sampling and original AR model by 67%, with up to 12.3$\times$
training speed-up simultaneously. DD2 takes a significant step toward the goal
of one-step AR generation, opening up new possibilities for fast and
high-quality AR modeling. Code is available at

Motivation: 在表示学习中确保公平性保证至关重要，以防止下游任务中对特定人口群体的不公平。需要保证每个下游预测中的人口统计差异以可控的高概率保持在用户定义的误差阈值内。

Method: 提出了FRG（Fair Representation learning with high-confidence Guarantees）框架，利用优化的对抗模型来提供高置信度的公平性保证。

Result: 在三个真实世界数据集上的实验表明，FRG在一系列下游模型和任务中始终能够限制不公平性，优于六种最先进的公平表示学习方法。

Conclusion: FRG框架能够有效学习具有高置信度公平性保证的表示，为下游任务提供可靠的人口统计差异控制。

Abstract: Representation learning is increasingly applied to generate representations
that generalize well across multiple downstream tasks. Ensuring fairness
guarantees in representation learning is crucial to prevent unfairness toward
specific demographic groups in downstream tasks. In this work, we formally
introduce the task of learning representations that achieve high-confidence
fairness. We aim to guarantee that demographic disparity in every downstream
prediction remains bounded by a *user-defined* error threshold $\epsilon$, with
*controllable* high probability. To this end, we propose the ***F**air
**R**epresentation learning with high-confidence **G**uarantees (FRG)*
framework, which provides these high-confidence fairness guarantees by
leveraging an optimized adversarial model. We empirically evaluate FRG on three
real-world datasets, comparing its performance to six state-of-the-art fair
representation learning methods. Our results demonstrate that FRG consistently
bounds unfairness across a range of downstream models and tasks.

TL;DR: 本文研究零阶优化在持续学习中的应用，发现它通过产生更平坦的损失景观来减少遗忘，但会牺牲可塑性。作者提出ZO-FC方法，在PEFT模块中使用ZO优化，在分类器中使用FO优化，有效平衡稳定性和可塑性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索零阶优化作为解决持续学习中可塑性-稳定性-效率三难问题的新方法，特别是在梯度计算昂贵或不切实际的场景下。

Method: 通过理论分析和实证研究评估ZO优化在持续学习中的应用，并提出ZO-FC方法：在PEFT模块使用ZO优化，在分类器使用FO优化。

Result: ZO优化能增强稳定性（减少遗忘）但会削弱可塑性（学习新知识能力）。ZO-FC方法在保持稳定性的同时保留了可塑性，且内存开销可忽略。

Conclusion: ZO-FC为设备端持续学习提供了实用且内存高效的解决方案，有效平衡了稳定性和可塑性之间的权衡。

Abstract: Zeroth-order (ZO) optimization has gained attention as a memory-efficient
alternative to first-order (FO) methods, particularly in settings where
gradient computation is expensive or even impractical. Beyond its memory
efficiency, in this work, we investigate ZO optimization for continual learning
(CL) as a novel approach to address the plasticity-stability-efficiency
trilemma. Through theoretical analysis and empirical evidence, we show that ZO
optimization naturally leads to flatter loss landscapes, which in turn reduce
forgetting in CL. However, this stability comes at a cost of plasticity: due to
its imprecise gradient estimates and slower convergence, ZO optimization tends
to be less effective than FO in acquiring new task-specific knowledge,
particularly under constrained training budgets. To better understand this
trade-off, we conduct a holistic evaluation of ZO optimization applied to
various existing CL methods. Our findings reveal that ZO optimization enhances
stability but often undermines plasticity, particularly when used with
learnable classifiers. Motivated by this insight, we propose ZO-FC, a simple
but effective approach that applies ZO optimization to a single adapter-based
PEFT module with FO optimized classifier. This design leverages the stability
benefits of ZO while preserving the adaptability of FO updates with negligible
memory overhead. Experiments demonstrate that ZO-FC achieves an effective
balance between stability and plasticity, offering a practical and
memory-efficient solution for on-device CL.

Conclusion: 学习率的选择与算法设计同样重要，对实现统计和计算效率至关重要。

Abstract: To understand feature learning dynamics in neural networks, recent
theoretical works have focused on gradient-based learning of Gaussian
single-index models, where the label is a nonlinear function of a latent
one-dimensional projection of the input. While the sample complexity of online
SGD is determined by the information exponent of the link function, recent
works improved this by performing multiple gradient steps on the same sample
with different learning rates -- yielding a non-correlational update rule --
and instead are limited by the (potentially much smaller) generative exponent.
However, this picture is only valid when these learning rates are sufficiently
large. In this paper, we characterize the relationship between learning rate(s)
and sample complexity for a broad class of gradient-based algorithms that
encapsulates both correlational and non-correlational updates. We demonstrate
that, in certain cases, there is a phase transition from an "information
exponent regime" with small learning rate to a "generative exponent regime"
with large learning rate. Our framework covers prior analyses of one-pass SGD
and SGD with batch reuse, while also introducing a new layer-wise training
algorithm that leverages a two-timescales approach (via different learning
rates for each layer) to go beyond correlational queries without reusing
samples or modifying the loss from squared error. Our theoretical study
demonstrates that the choice of learning rate is as important as the design of
the algorithm in achieving statistical and computational efficiency.

Abstract: Labeling or classifying time series is a persistent challenge in the physical
sciences, where expert annotations are scarce, costly, and often inconsistent.
Yet robust labeling is essential to enable machine learning models for
understanding, prediction, and forecasting. We present the \textit{Clustering
and Indexation Pipeline with Human Evaluation for Recognition} (CIPHER), a
framework designed to accelerate large-scale labeling of complex time series in
physics. CIPHER integrates \textit{indexable Symbolic Aggregate approXimation}
(iSAX) for interpretable compression and indexing, density-based clustering
(HDBSCAN) to group recurring phenomena, and a human-in-the-loop step for
efficient expert validation. Representative samples are labeled by domain
scientists, and these annotations are propagated across clusters to yield
systematic, scalable classifications. We evaluate CIPHER on the task of
classifying solar wind phenomena in OMNI data, a central challenge in space
weather research, showing that the framework recovers meaningful phenomena such
as coronal mass ejections and stream interaction regions. Beyond this case
study, CIPHER highlights a general strategy for combining symbolic
representations, unsupervised learning, and expert knowledge to address label
scarcity in time series across the physical sciences. The code and
configuration files used in this study are publicly available to support
reproducibility.

Abstract: Accurate long-term forecasting of spatiotemporal dynamics remains a
fundamental challenge across scientific and engineering domains. Existing
machine learning methods often neglect governing physical laws and fail to
quantify inherent uncertainties in spatiotemporal predictions. To address these
challenges, we introduce a physics-consistent neural operator (PCNO) that
enforces physical constraints by projecting surrogate model outputs onto
function spaces satisfying predefined laws. A physics-consistent projection
layer within PCNO efficiently computes mass and momentum conservation in
Fourier space. Building upon deterministic predictions, we further propose a
diffusion model-enhanced PCNO (DiffPCNO), which leverages a consistency model
to quantify and mitigate uncertainties, thereby improving the accuracy and
reliability of forecasts. PCNO and DiffPCNO achieve high-fidelity
spatiotemporal predictions while preserving physical consistency and
uncertainty across diverse systems and spatial resolutions, ranging from
turbulent flow modeling to real-world flood/atmospheric forecasting. Our
two-stage framework provides a robust and versatile approach for accurate,
physically grounded, and uncertainty-aware spatiotemporal forecasting.

Motivation: 当前脑机接口基准主要针对简单的基础任务，而实际应用如脑到文本转换仍难以实现。需要找到既实用又保护隐私的中间任务来推动研究进展。

Method: 使用52小时的LibriBrain语料库，提供标准化训练/验证/测试分割；采用AUPRC和FA/h评估指标；开发基于1-D Conv/ResNet的紧凑基线模型，使用焦点损失和top-k池化。

Conclusion: 关键词识别是脑机接口的可行中间任务，具有实际应用潜力；建立的基准和工具将促进该领域的研究进展。

Abstract: Non-invasive brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) are beginning to benefit from
large, public benchmarks. However, current benchmarks target relatively simple,
foundational tasks like Speech Detection and Phoneme Classification, while
application-ready results on tasks like Brain-to-Text remain elusive. We
propose Keyword Spotting (KWS) as a practically applicable, privacy-aware
intermediate task. Using the deep 52-hour, within-subject LibriBrain corpus, we
provide standardized train/validation/test splits for reproducible
benchmarking, and adopt an evaluation protocol tailored to extreme class
imbalance. Concretely, we use area under the precision-recall curve (AUPRC) as
a robust evaluation metric, complemented by false alarms per hour (FA/h) at
fixed recall to capture user-facing trade-offs. To simplify deployment and
further experimentation within the research community, we are releasing an
updated version of the pnpl library with word-level dataloaders and Colab-ready
tutorials. As an initial reference model, we present a compact 1-D Conv/ResNet
baseline with focal loss and top-k pooling that is trainable on a single
consumer-class GPU. The reference model achieves approximately 13x the
permutation baseline AUPRC on held-out sessions, demonstrating the viability of
the task. Exploratory analyses reveal: (i) predictable within-subject scaling -
performance improves log-linearly with more training hours - and (ii) the
existence of word-level factors (frequency and duration) that systematically
modulate detectability.

Conclusion: A-GPS是一个简单而强大的方法，能产生高质量帕累托集近似，灵活捕捉用户偏好，无需重新训练即可跨帕累托前沿采样。

Abstract: We introduce active generation of Pareto sets (A-GPS), a new framework for
online discrete black-box multi-objective optimization (MOO). A-GPS learns a
generative model of the Pareto set that supports a-posteriori conditioning on
user preferences. The method employs a class probability estimator (CPE) to
predict non-dominance relations and to condition the generative model toward
high-performing regions of the search space. We also show that this
non-dominance CPE implicitly estimates the probability of hypervolume
improvement (PHVI). To incorporate subjective trade-offs, A-GPS introduces
preference direction vectors that encode user-specified preferences in
objective space. At each iteration, the model is updated using both Pareto
membership and alignment with these preference directions, producing an
amortized generative model capable of sampling across the Pareto front without
retraining. The result is a simple yet powerful approach that achieves
high-quality Pareto set approximations, avoids explicit hypervolume
computation, and flexibly captures user preferences. Empirical results on
synthetic benchmarks and protein design tasks demonstrate strong sample
efficiency and effective preference incorporation.

Abstract: We study the online multi-class selection problem with group fairness
guarantees, where limited resources must be allocated to sequentially arriving
agents. Our work addresses two key limitations in the existing literature.
First, we introduce a novel lossless rounding scheme that ensures the integral
algorithm achieves the same expected performance as any fractional solution.
Second, we explicitly address the challenges introduced by agents who belong to
multiple classes. To this end, we develop a randomized algorithm based on a
relax-and-round framework. The algorithm first computes a fractional solution
using a resource reservation approach -- referred to as the set-aside mechanism
-- to enforce fairness across classes. The subsequent rounding step preserves
these fairness guarantees without degrading performance. Additionally, we
propose a learning-augmented variant that incorporates untrusted
machine-learned predictions to better balance fairness and efficiency in
practical settings.

Abstract: Policy optimization (PO) is a cornerstone of modern reinforcement learning
(RL), with diverse applications spanning robotics, healthcare, and large
language model training. The increasing deployment of PO in sensitive domains,
however, raises significant privacy concerns. In this paper, we initiate a
theoretical study of differentially private policy optimization, focusing
explicitly on its sample complexity. We first formalize an appropriate
definition of differential privacy (DP) tailored to PO, addressing the inherent
challenges arising from on-policy learning dynamics and the subtlety involved
in defining the unit of privacy. We then systematically analyze the sample
complexity of widely-used PO algorithms, including policy gradient (PG),
natural policy gradient (NPG) and more, under DP constraints and various
settings, via a unified framework. Our theoretical results demonstrate that
privacy costs can often manifest as lower-order terms in the sample complexity,
while also highlighting subtle yet important observations in private PO
settings. These offer valuable practical insights for privacy-preserving PO
algorithms.

as anomaly thresholds for each parameter. We reveal characteristic trends in
the inner heliosphere, including increasing solar wind speed with distance from
the Sun, decreasing proton density, and the inverse relationship between speed

Abstract: Reasoning models represent a significant advance in LLM capabilities,
particularly for complex reasoning tasks such as mathematics and coding.
Previous studies confirm that parallel test-time compute-sampling multiple
solutions and selecting the best one-can further enhance the predictive
performance of LLMs. However, strategies in this area often require complex
scoring, thus increasing computational cost and complexity. In this work, we
demonstrate that the simple and counterintuitive heuristic of selecting the
shortest solution is highly effective. We posit that the observed effectiveness
stems from models operating in two distinct regimes: a concise, confident
conventional regime and a verbose overthinking regime characterized by
uncertainty, and we show evidence of a critical point where the overthinking
regime begins to be significant. By selecting the shortest answer, the
heuristic preferentially samples from the conventional regime. We confirm that
this approach is competitive with more complex methods such as self-consistency
across two challenging benchmarks while significantly reducing computational
overhead. The shortest-answer heuristic provides a Pareto improvement over
self-consistency and applies even to tasks where output equality is not well
defined.

Abstract: Among many mysteries behind the success of deep networks lies the exceptional
discriminative power of their learned representations as manifested by the
intriguing Neural Collapse (NC) phenomenon, where simple feature structures
emerge at the last layer of a trained neural network. Prior works on the
theoretical understandings of NC have focused on analyzing the optimization
landscape of matrix-factorization-like problems by considering the last-layer
features as unconstrained free optimization variables and showing that their
global minima exhibit NC. In this paper, we show that gradient flow on a
two-layer ReLU network for classifying orthogonally separable data provably
exhibits NC, thereby advancing prior results in two ways: First, we relax the
assumption of unconstrained features, showing the effect of data structure and
nonlinear activations on NC characterizations. Second, we reveal the role of
the implicit bias of the training dynamics in facilitating the emergence of NC.

Conclusion: DictPFL首次证明基于同态加密的私有联邦学习在实际部署中是可行的，为真实世界应用提供了实用的隐私保护解决方案。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across
institutions without sharing raw data. However, gradient sharing still risks
privacy leakage, such as gradient inversion attacks. Homomorphic Encryption
(HE) can secure aggregation but often incurs prohibitive computational and
communication overhead. Existing HE-based FL methods sit at two extremes:
encrypting all gradients for full privacy at high cost, or partially encrypting
gradients to save resources while exposing vulnerabilities. We present DictPFL,
a practical framework that achieves full gradient protection with minimal
overhead. DictPFL encrypts every transmitted gradient while keeping
non-transmitted parameters local, preserving privacy without heavy computation.
It introduces two key modules: Decompose-for-Partial-Encrypt (DePE), which
decomposes model weights into a static dictionary and an updatable lookup
table, only the latter is encrypted and aggregated, while the static dictionary
remains local and requires neither sharing nor encryption; and
Prune-for-Minimum-Encrypt (PrME), which applies encryption-aware pruning to
minimize encrypted parameters via consistent, history-guided masks. Experiments
show that DictPFL reduces communication cost by 402-748$\times$ and accelerates
training by 28-65$\times$ compared to fully encrypted FL, while outperforming
state-of-the-art selective encryption methods by 51-155$\times$ in overhead and
4-19$\times$ in speed. Remarkably, DictPFL's runtime is within 2$\times$ of
plaintext FL, demonstrating for the first time, that HE-based private federated
learning is practical for real-world deployment. The code is publicly available

Conclusion: 将全局基序知识与细粒度局部上下文相结合，能够显著提升少样本分子属性预测的鲁棒性和性能。

Abstract: Molecular property prediction (MPP) is a cornerstone of drug discovery and
materials science, yet conventional deep learning approaches depend on large
labeled datasets that are often unavailable. Few-shot Molecular property
prediction (FSMPP) addresses this scarcity by incorporating relational
inductive bias through a context graph that links molecule nodes to property
nodes, but such molecule-property graphs offer limited structural guidance. We
propose a comprehensive solution: Motif Driven Global-Local Context Graph for
few-shot molecular property prediction, which enriches contextual information
at both the global and local levels. At the global level, chemically meaningful
motif nodes representing shared substructures, such as rings or functional
groups, are introduced to form a global tri-partite heterogeneous graph,
yielding motif-molecule-property connections that capture long-range
compositional patterns and enable knowledge transfer among molecules with
common motifs. At the local level, we build a subgraph for each node in the
molecule-property pair and encode them separately to concentrate the model's
attention on the most informative neighboring molecules and motifs. Experiments
on five standard FSMPP benchmarks demonstrate that our framework consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art methods. These results underscore the
effectiveness of integrating global motif knowledge with fine-grained local
context to advance robust few-shot molecular property prediction.

*Yunuo Zhang,Baiting Luo,Ayan Mukhopadhyay,Gabor Karsai,Abhishek Dubey*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ESCORT是一个基于粒子的框架，用于在高维信念空间中捕获复杂多模态分布，通过相关感知投影和时间一致性约束改进SVGD方法，在信念近似准确性和决策质量方面优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着环境变得更加真实，信念分布变得复杂，标准数学模型无法准确捕获，现有POMDP信念近似方法无法准确表示复杂不确定性结构（如高维多模态信念分布），导致估计误差和次优行为。

Method: ESCORT扩展SVGD，引入两个关键创新：相关感知投影（建模状态维度间的依赖关系）和时间一致性约束（在保持相关结构的同时稳定更新），保留SVGD的吸引-排斥粒子动力学，同时能够准确建模复杂相关模式。

Result: 在POMDP领域和合成多模态分布上的广泛评估表明，ESCORT在信念近似准确性和下游决策质量方面始终优于最先进方法。

Conclusion: ESCORT能够动态适应信念景观复杂性，无需重采样或限制性分布假设，为复杂高维信念分布提供了有效的近似方法。

Abstract: In Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs), maintaining and
updating belief distributions over possible underlying states provides a
principled way to summarize action-observation history for effective
decision-making under uncertainty. As environments grow more realistic, belief
distributions develop complexity that standard mathematical models cannot
accurately capture, creating a fundamental challenge in maintaining
representational accuracy. Despite advances in deep learning and probabilistic
modeling, existing POMDP belief approximation methods fail to accurately
represent complex uncertainty structures such as high-dimensional, multi-modal
belief distributions, resulting in estimation errors that lead to suboptimal
agent behaviors. To address this challenge, we present ESCORT (Efficient
Stein-variational and sliced Consistency-Optimized Representation for Temporal
beliefs), a particle-based framework for capturing complex, multi-modal
distributions in high-dimensional belief spaces. ESCORT extends SVGD with two
key innovations: correlation-aware projections that model dependencies between
state dimensions, and temporal consistency constraints that stabilize updates
while preserving correlation structures. This approach retains SVGD's
attractive-repulsive particle dynamics while enabling accurate modeling of
intricate correlation patterns. Unlike particle filters prone to degeneracy or
parametric methods with fixed representational capacity, ESCORT dynamically
adapts to belief landscape complexity without resampling or restrictive
distributional assumptions. We demonstrate ESCORT's effectiveness through
extensive evaluations on both POMDP domains and synthetic multi-modal
distributions of varying dimensionality, where it consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in terms of belief approximation accuracy and
downstream decision quality.

TL;DR: 提出一种模型无关的特征选择方法，通过贝叶斯最优预测器的方差优化，在多子群体中平衡下游预测性能，无需反向传播训练过程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在特征收集成本高的场景下（如问卷调查或物理传感器），需要选择有限特征来训练能同时在多个子群体中表现良好的模型。

Method: 将问题构建为传统变量选择的连续松弛，使用加噪机制，通过优化贝叶斯最优预测器的方差来平衡不同群体的预测性能。

Result: 在合成数据集和真实世界数据上的实验验证了该方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种模型无关的特征选择框架，能够在多群体设置下平衡预测性能，适用于特征收集成本高的应用场景。

Abstract: We study the problem of selecting limited features to observe such that
models trained on them can perform well simultaneously across multiple
subpopulations. This problem has applications in settings where collecting each
feature is costly, e.g. requiring adding survey questions or physical sensors,
and we must be able to use the selected features to create high-quality
downstream models for different populations. Our method frames the problem as a
continuous relaxation of traditional variable selection using a noising
mechanism, without requiring backpropagation through model training processes.
By optimizing over the variance of a Bayes-optimal predictor, we develop a
model-agnostic framework that balances overall performance of downstream
prediction across populations. We validate our approach through experiments on
both synthetic datasets and real-world data.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SolarBoost是一种用于分布式光伏系统功率输出预测的新方法，通过将聚合功率输出建模为小电网输出的组合，解决了DPV系统面临的电网级数据缺失、容量变化等挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有集中式光伏方法难以应用于分布式光伏系统，因为DPV面临电网级数据缺失、安装容量时间变化、地理变异性和面板多样性等挑战。

Method: 将聚合功率输出建模为小电网输出的组合，每个电网输出使用单位输出函数乘以其容量来建模，将同质单位输出函数与动态容量解耦以实现准确预测。

Result: 通过理论分析和实验验证了电网级建模的优越性，在中国多个城市部署验证，显著减少了潜在损失，为电网运行提供了宝贵见解。

Conclusion: SolarBoost通过创新的电网级建模方法，有效解决了分布式光伏系统功率预测的挑战，在实际部署中表现出色。

Abstract: This paper presents SolarBoost, a novel approach for forecasting power output
in distributed photovoltaic (DPV) systems. While existing centralized
photovoltaic (CPV) methods are able to precisely model output dependencies due
to uniformity, it is difficult to apply such techniques to DPV systems, as DPVs
face challenges such as missing grid-level data, temporal shifts in installed
capacity, geographic variability, and panel diversity. SolarBoost overcomes
these challenges by modeling aggregated power output as a composite of output
from small grids, where each grid output is modeled using a unit output
function multiplied by its capacity. This approach decouples the homogeneous
unit output function from dynamic capacity for accurate prediction. Efficient
algorithms over an upper-bound approximation are proposed to overcome
computational bottlenecks in loss functions. We demonstrate the superiority of
grid-level modeling via theoretical analysis and experiments. SolarBoost has
been validated through deployment across various cities in China, significantly
reducing potential losses and provides valuable insights for the operation of
power grids. The code for this work is available at

Motivation: 医疗物联网中的顺序工作流需要严格的端到端延迟保证，在异构云-雾-边缘基础设施上调度这些工作流以最小化完成时间是一个NP难问题。

Method: 采用两层DDPG调度框架：全局控制器执行层选择（边缘、雾或云），专用本地控制器处理选定层内的节点分配。

Result: 实验结果表明，随着工作流复杂度的增加，该方法相比基线方法表现出越来越优越的性能。

Conclusion: 该框架能够学习有效的长期策略，对于复杂、大规模的医疗物联网调度场景至关重要。

Abstract: The Medical Internet of Things (MIoT) demands stringent end-to-end latency
guarantees for sequential healthcare workflows deployed over heterogeneous
cloud-fog-edge infrastructures. Scheduling these sequential workflows to
minimize makespan is an NP-hard problem. To tackle this challenge, we propose a
Two-tier DDPG-based scheduling framework that decomposes the scheduling
decision into a hierarchical process: a global controller performs layer
selection (edge, fog, or cloud), while specialized local controllers handle
node assignment within the chosen layer. The primary optimization objective is
the minimization of the workflow makespan. Experiments results validate our
approach, demonstrating increasingly superior performance over baselines as
workflow complexity rises. This trend highlights the frameworks ability to
learn effective long-term strategies, which is critical for complex,
large-scale MIoT scheduling scenarios.

Abstract: Designing de novo 3D molecules with desirable properties remains a
fundamental challenge in drug discovery and molecular engineering. While
diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in generating
high-quality 3D molecular structures, they often struggle to effectively
control complex multi-objective constraints critical for real-world
applications. In this study, we propose an uncertainty-aware Reinforcement
Learning (RL) framework to guide the optimization of 3D molecular diffusion
models toward multiple property objectives while enhancing the overall quality
of the generated molecules. Our method leverages surrogate models with
predictive uncertainty estimation to dynamically shape reward functions,
facilitating balance across multiple optimization objectives. We
comprehensively evaluate our framework across three benchmark datasets and
multiple diffusion model architectures, consistently outperforming baselines
for molecular quality and property optimization. Additionally, Molecular
Dynamics (MD) simulations and ADMET profiling of top generated candidates
indicate promising drug-like behavior and binding stability, comparable to
known Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) inhibitors. Our results
demonstrate the strong potential of RL-guided generative diffusion models for
advancing automated molecular design.

Conclusion: 矩阵分解框架为经典和鲁棒聚类提供了统一的理论基础，l1,2-范数的使用有效提升了聚类算法对异常值的鲁棒性，所提算法具有良好的理论保证。

Abstract: This paper presents a unified matrix factorization framework for classical
and robust clustering. We begin by revisiting the well-known equivalence
between crisp k-means clustering and matrix factorization, following and
rigorously rederiving an unpublished formulation by Bauckhage. Extending this
framework, we derive an analogous matrix factorization interpretation for fuzzy
c-means clustering, which to the best of our knowledge has not been previously
formalized. These reformulations allow both clustering paradigms to be
expressed as optimization problems over factor matrices, thereby enabling
principled extensions to robust variants. To address sensitivity to outliers,
we propose robust formulations for both crisp and fuzzy clustering by replacing
the Frobenius norm with the l1,2-norm, which penalizes the sum of Euclidean
norms across residual columns. We develop alternating minimization algorithms
for the standard formulations and IRLS-based algorithms for the robust
counterparts. All algorithms are theoretically proven to converge to a local
minimum.

Abstract: The Meteorology is a field where huge amounts of data are generated, mainly
collected by sensors at weather stations, where different variables can be
measured. Those data have some particularities such as high volume and
dimensionality, the frequent existence of missing values in some stations, and
the high correlation between collected variables. In this regard, it is crucial
to make use of Big Data and Data Mining techniques to deal with those data and
extract useful knowledge from them that can be used, for instance, to predict
weather phenomena. In this paper, we propose a visual big data system that is
designed to deal with high amounts of weather-related data and lets the user
analyze those data to perform predictive tasks over the considered variables
(temperature and rainfall). The proposed system collects open data and loads
them onto a local NoSQL database fusing them at different levels of temporal
and spatial aggregation in order to perform a predictive analysis using
univariate and multivariate approaches as well as forecasting based on training
data from neighbor stations in cases with high rates of missing values. The
system has been assessed in terms of usability and predictive performance,
obtaining an overall normalized mean squared error value of 0.00013, and an
overall directional symmetry value of nearly 0.84. Our system has been rated
positively by a group of experts in the area (all aspects of the system except
graphic desing were rated 3 or above in a 1-5 scale). The promising preliminary
results obtained demonstrate the validity of our system and invite us to keep
working on this area.

Motivation: 解决道德风险和合同理论中的委托-代理问题，该问题在从市场设计到投资组合管理、对冲基金费用结构和高管薪酬等应用中都很重要。现实环境中非线性效用、随机动态或高维动作通常没有闭式解。

Method: 采用现代机器学习技术进行双层优化，使用隐式微分与共轭梯度法，通过Hessian-向量乘积高效计算超梯度。

Conclusion: 为合同设计提供了新的计算工具，使得系统研究分析上难以处理的模型成为可能。

Abstract: We study a bilevel \emph{max-max} optimization framework for principal-agent
contract design, in which a principal chooses incentives to maximize utility
while anticipating the agent's best response. This problem, central to moral
hazard and contract theory, underlies applications ranging from market design
to delegated portfolio management, hedge fund fee structures, and executive
compensation. While linear-quadratic models such as Holmstr"om-Milgrom admit
closed-form solutions, realistic environments with nonlinear utilities,
stochastic dynamics, or high-dimensional actions generally do not.
  We introduce a generic algorithmic framework that removes this reliance on
closed forms. Our method adapts modern machine learning techniques for bilevel
optimization -- using implicit differentiation with conjugate gradients (CG) --
to compute hypergradients efficiently through Hessian-vector products, without
ever forming or inverting Hessians. In benchmark CARA-Normal (Constant Absolute
Risk Aversion with Gaussian distribution of uncertainty) environments, the
approach recovers known analytical optima and converges reliably from random
initialization. More broadly, because it is matrix-free, variance-reduced, and
problem-agnostic, the framework extends naturally to complex nonlinear
contracts where closed-form solutions are unavailable, such as sigmoidal wage
schedules (logistic pay), relative-performance/tournament compensation with
common shocks, multi-task contracts with vector actions and heterogeneous
noise, and CARA-Poisson count models with $\mathbb{E}[X\mid a]=e^{a}$. This
provides a new computational tool for contract design, enabling systematic
study of models that have remained analytically intractable.

Motivation: 标准强化学习方法优化平均奖励，而专注于减少不良输出概率的方法通常以牺牲平均性能为代价。需要改进这种权衡关系。

Method: 在标准强化学习损失基础上增加额外损失，使用学习到的建议来引导采样低奖励输出，然后降低这些输出的概率。

Result: 实验表明RePULSe在期望奖励与不良输出概率之间实现了更好的权衡，并且比标准强化学习对齐方法和替代方法具有更强的对抗鲁棒性。

Conclusion: RePULSe方法有效改善了语言模型对齐中期望奖励与不良输出概率之间的权衡关系。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has become a predominant technique to align
language models (LMs) with human preferences or promote outputs which are
deemed to be desirable by a given reward function. Standard RL approaches
optimize average reward, while methods explicitly focused on reducing the
probability of undesired outputs typically come at a cost to average-case
performance. To improve this tradeoff, we introduce RePULSe, a new training
method that augments the standard RL loss with an additional loss that uses
learned proposals to guide sampling low-reward outputs, and then reduces those
outputs' probability. We run experiments demonstrating that RePULSe produces a
better tradeoff of expected reward versus the probability of undesired outputs
and is more adversarially robust, compared to standard RL alignment approaches
and alternatives.

Conclusion: PLAN框架通过主动的子空间管理和干扰最小化策略，成功解决了大型预训练模型在持续学习中的效率和知识保留问题。

Abstract: Continual learning (CL) requires models to continuously adapt to new tasks
without forgetting past knowledge. In this work, we propose
\underline{P}roactive \underline{L}ow-rank \underline{A}llocatio\underline{N}
(PLAN), a framework that extends Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to enable efficient
and interference-aware fine-tuning of large pre-trained models in CL settings.
PLAN proactively manages the allocation of task-specific subspaces by
introducing orthogonal basis vectors for each task and optimizing them through
a perturbation-based strategy that minimizes conflicts with previously learned
parameters. Furthermore, PLAN incorporates a novel selection mechanism that
identifies and assigns basis vectors with minimal sensitivity to interference,
reducing the risk of degrading past knowledge while maintaining efficient
adaptation to new tasks. Empirical results on standard CL benchmarks
demonstrate that PLAN consistently outperforms existing methods, establishing a
new state-of-the-art for continual learning with foundation models.

Conclusion: GenReview数据集为研究LLM在科学同行评审中的影响提供了重要资源，揭示了LLM在评审过程中的局限性和潜在问题。

Abstract: How does the progressive embracement of Large Language Models (LLMs) affect
scientific peer reviewing? This multifaceted question is fundamental to the
effectiveness -- as well as to the integrity -- of the scientific process.
Recent evidence suggests that LLMs may have already been tacitly used in peer
reviewing, e.g., at the 2024 International Conference of Learning
Representations (ICLR). Furthermore, some efforts have been undertaken in an
attempt to explicitly integrate LLMs in peer reviewing by various editorial
boards (including that of ICLR'25). To fully understand the utility and the
implications of LLMs' deployment for scientific reviewing, a comprehensive
relevant dataset is strongly desirable. Despite some previous research on this
topic, such dataset has been lacking so far. We fill in this gap by presenting
GenReview, the hitherto largest dataset containing LLM-written reviews. Our
dataset includes 81K reviews generated for all submissions to the 2018--2025
editions of the ICLR by providing the LLM with three independent prompts: a
negative, a positive, and a neutral one. GenReview is also linked to the
respective papers and their original reviews, thereby enabling a broad range of
investigations. To illustrate the value of GenReview, we explore a sample of
intriguing research questions, namely: if LLMs exhibit bias in reviewing (they
do); if LLM-written reviews can be automatically detected (so far, they can);
if LLMs can rigorously follow reviewing instructions (not always) and whether
LLM-provided ratings align with decisions on paper acceptance or rejection
(holds true only for accepted papers). GenReview can be accessed at the
following link: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/gen_review.

Motivation: AUC在类别不平衡分类任务中很重要，但直接优化面临非凸不连续损失函数和内存瓶颈的挑战，需要更高效的优化方法。

Method: 提出基于成对铰链损失的二阶代理损失，用训练数据的一阶和二阶统计量直接替代整个聚合的成对损失，并开发了高效的在线算法和核化扩展。

Conclusion: 提出的二阶代理损失方法为AUC优化提供了新的范式，在理论和实验上都表现出色，特别适合大规模在线学习场景。

Abstract: The Area Under the Curve (AUC) is an important performance metric for
classification tasks, particularly in class-imbalanced scenarios. However,
minimizing the AUC presents significant challenges due to the non-convex and
discontinuous nature of pairwise 0/1 losses, which are difficult to optimize,
as well as the substantial memory cost of instance-wise storage, which creates
bottlenecks in large-scale applications. To overcome these challenges, we
propose a novel second-order surrogate loss based on the pairwise hinge loss,
and develop an efficient online algorithm. Unlike conventional approaches that
approximate each individual pairwise 0/1 loss term with an instance-wise
surrogate function, our approach introduces a new paradigm that directly
substitutes the entire aggregated pairwise loss with a surrogate loss function
constructed from the first- and second-order statistics of the training data.
Theoretically, while existing online AUC optimization algorithms typically
achieve an $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{T})$ regret bound, our method attains a tighter
$\mathcal{O}(\ln T)$ bound. Furthermore, we extend the proposed framework to
nonlinear settings through a kernel-based formulation. Extensive experiments on
multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate the superior efficiency and
effectiveness of the proposed second-order surrogate loss in optimizing online
AUC performance.

Conclusion: 合成先验分布的设计对TFMs性能至关重要，Mitra通过精心设计的混合先验实现了更优的泛化能力。

Abstract: Since the seminal work of TabPFN, research on tabular foundation models
(TFMs) based on in-context learning (ICL) has challenged long-standing
paradigms in machine learning. Without seeing any real-world data, models
pretrained on purely synthetic datasets generalize remarkably well across
diverse datasets, often using only a moderate number of in-context examples.
This shifts the focus in tabular machine learning from model architecture
design to the design of synthetic datasets, or, more precisely, to the prior
distributions that generate them. Yet the guiding principles for prior design
remain poorly understood. This work marks the first attempt to address the gap.
We systematically investigate and identify key properties of synthetic priors
that allow pretrained TFMs to generalize well. Based on these insights, we
introduce Mitra, a TFM trained on a curated mixture of synthetic priors
selected for their diversity, distinctiveness, and performance on real-world
tabular data. Mitra consistently outperforms state-of-the-art TFMs, such as
TabPFNv2 and TabICL, across both classification and regression benchmarks, with
better sample efficiency.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 图神经网络面临适应性挑战，固定的消息传递架构难以处理现实世界中图结构的巨大多样性，而现有的图MoE方法依赖监督信号且训练不稳定。

Method: 采用骨干-残差专家架构，基础编码器提供稳定性，专用残差专家捕获多样化计算模式；使用结构感知门控网络进行细粒度节点路由；通过统一无监督目标进行端到端训练，结合重构任务和信息论多样性正则化。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) face a fundamental adaptability challenge: their
fixed message-passing architectures struggle with the immense diversity of
real-world graphs, where optimal computational strategies vary by local
structure and task. While Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) offers a promising pathway
to adaptability, existing graph MoE methods remain constrained by their
reliance on supervised signals and instability when training heterogeneous
experts. We introduce ADaMoRE (Adaptive Mixture of Residual Experts), a
principled framework that enables robust, fully unsupervised training of
heterogeneous MoE on graphs. ADaMoRE employs a backbone-residual expert
architecture where foundational encoders provide stability while specialized
residual experts capture diverse computational patterns. A structurally-aware
gating network performs fine-grained node routing. The entire architecture is
trained end-to-end using a unified unsupervised objective, which integrates a
primary reconstruction task with an information-theoretic diversity regularizer
to explicitly enforce functional specialization among the experts. Theoretical
analysis confirms our design improves data efficiency and training stability.
Extensive evaluation across 16 benchmarks validates ADaMoRE's state-of-the-art
performance in unsupervised node classification and few-shot learning,
alongside superior generalization, training efficiency, and faster convergence
on diverse graphs and tasks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种将物理约束嵌入流匹配生成模型的框架，通过2D Ising模型使生成过程的每一步都具有物理意义，解决了传统流匹配模型中间步骤缺乏可解释性的问题。

Motivation: 传统基于流匹配的生成模型虽然成功，但其中间生成步骤缺乏可解释性 - 向量场更新的每一步物理意义不明确。

Method: 将流轨迹映射到模拟物理过程的平衡状态，通过2D Ising模型实现，使流步骤成为参数化冷却调度中的热平衡点。架构包括编码器、流匹配网络和投影器。

Result: 在多种晶格尺寸下验证，在保持物理保真度的同时，随着晶格尺寸增大，生成速度优于蒙特卡洛方法。每个向量场代表2D Ising模型潜在空间中有意义的逐步转变。

Conclusion: 将物理语义嵌入生成流可以将不透明的神经轨迹转化为可解释的物理过程，为生成模型提供了物理可解释性。

Abstract: Generative models based on flow matching have demonstrated remarkable success
in various domains, yet they suffer from a fundamental limitation: the lack of
interpretability in their intermediate generation steps. In fact these models
learn to transform noise into data through a series of vector field updates,
however the meaning of each step remains opaque. We address this problem by
proposing a general framework constraining each flow step to be sampled from a
known physical distribution. Flow trajectories are mapped to (and constrained
to traverse) the equilibrium states of the simulated physical process. We
implement this approach through the 2D Ising model in such a way that flow
steps become thermal equilibrium points along a parametric cooling schedule.
  Our proposed architecture includes an encoder that maps discrete Ising
configurations into a continuous latent space, a flow-matching network that
performs temperature-driven diffusion, and a projector that returns to discrete
Ising states while preserving physical constraints.
  We validate this framework across multiple lattice sizes, showing that it
preserves physical fidelity while outperforming Monte Carlo generation in speed
as the lattice size increases. In contrast with standard flow matching, each
vector field represents a meaningful stepwise transition in the 2D Ising
model's latent space. This demonstrates that embedding physical semantics into
generative flows transforms opaque neural trajectories into interpretable
physical processes.

Conclusion: FDAs框架为模型合并提供了新的视角，连接了联合多任务训练和后验合并，具有鲁棒性和灵活性。

Abstract: Model merging is an efficient post-training strategy for integrating
knowledge from multiple finetuned checkpoints of a shared foundation model.
Existing methods operate in the parameter space, combining task vectors to
mitigate conflicts, but remain constrained by parameter inconsistencies. We
propose Functional Dual Anchors (FDAs), a framework that instead models the
input-representation space. FDAs are synthetic inputs whose induced gradients
align with task vectors, capturing task-specific functional shifts relative to
the pretrained model. This perspective bridges joint multi-task training and
post-hoc merging, offering both robustness and flexibility. We further
introduce a principled initialization scheme and show that FDAs are
complementary to parameter-space model merging. Comprehensive experiments
demonstrate the effectiveness of FDAs in model merging.

Conclusion: 通过对抗训练成功构建了神经网络世界模型中的最混淆实例，发现混淆程度与模型不确定性相关，为深度模型强化学习的理论探索策略提供了启示。

Abstract: In reinforcement learning (RL) theory, the concept of most confusing
instances is central to establishing regret lower bounds, that is, the minimal
exploration needed to solve a problem. Given a reference model and its optimal
policy, a most confusing instance is the statistically closest alternative
model that makes a suboptimal policy optimal. While this concept is
well-studied in multi-armed bandits and ergodic tabular Markov decision
processes, constructing such instances remains an open question in the general
case. In this paper, we formalize this problem for neural network world models
as a constrained optimization: finding a modified model that is statistically
close to the reference one, while producing divergent performance between
optimal and suboptimal policies. We propose an adversarial training procedure
to solve this problem and conduct an empirical study across world models of
varying quality. Our results suggest that the degree of achievable confusion
correlates with uncertainty in the approximate model, which may inform
theoretically-grounded exploration strategies for deep model-based RL.

Conclusion: 理论结果通过回归设置中的数值实验得到验证，表明SGLD在惰性训练机制下具有良好的收敛性质。

Abstract: Continuous-time models provide important insights into the training dynamics
of optimization algorithms in deep learning. In this work, we establish a
non-asymptotic convergence analysis of stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics
(SGLD), which is an It\^o stochastic differential equation (SDE) approximation
of stochastic gradient descent in continuous time, in the lazy training regime.
We show that, under regularity conditions on the Hessian of the loss function,
SGLD with multiplicative and state-dependent noise (i) yields a non-degenerate
kernel throughout the training process with high probability, and (ii) achieves
exponential convergence to the empirical risk minimizer in expectation, and we
establish finite-time and finite-width bounds on the optimality gap. We
corroborate our theoretical findings with numerical examples in the regression
setting.

Abstract: Recent advances in Scientific Machine Learning have shown that second-order
methods can enhance the training of Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs),
making them a suitable alternative to traditional numerical methods for Partial
Differential Equations (PDEs). However, second-order methods induce large
memory requirements, making them scale poorly with the model size. In this
paper, we define a local Mixture of Experts (MoE) combining the
parameter-efficiency of ensemble models and sparse coding to enable the use of
second-order training. Our model -- \textsc{PINN Balls} -- also features a
fully learnable domain decomposition structure, achieved through the use of
Adversarial Adaptive Sampling (AAS), which adapts the DD to the PDE and its
domain. \textsc{PINN Balls} achieves better accuracy than the state-of-the-art
in scientific machine learning, while maintaining invaluable scalability
properties and drawing from a sound theoretical background.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 图注意力在全局交互学习中面临过聚合问题，即大量消息被不加区分地聚合到单个节点，导致关键信息被稀释和丢失。

Result: 评估显示Wideformer能有效缓解过聚合，使骨干方法专注于信息丰富的消息，性能优于基线方法。

Conclusion: Wideformer通过并行聚合和引导机制成功解决了图注意力中的过聚合问题，提升了模型性能。

Abstract: Graph attention has demonstrated superior performance in graph learning
tasks. However, learning from global interactions can be challenging due to the
large number of nodes. In this paper, we discover a new phenomenon termed
over-aggregating. Over-aggregating arises when a large volume of messages is
aggregated into a single node with less discrimination, leading to the dilution
of the key messages and potential information loss. To address this, we propose
Wideformer, a plug-and-play method for graph attention. Wideformer divides the
aggregation of all nodes into parallel processes and guides the model to focus
on specific subsets of these processes. The division can limit the input volume
per aggregation, avoiding message dilution and reducing information loss. The
guiding step sorts and weights the aggregation outputs, prioritizing the
informative messages. Evaluations show that Wideformer can effectively mitigate
over-aggregating. As a result, the backbone methods can focus on the
informative messages, achieving superior performance compared to baseline
methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统测试时适应方法依赖归一化层更新存在关键问题：对批次大小敏感导致统计不稳定，且受限于预训练模型结构，在显著域偏移下效果有限

Method: 引入Buffer层概念，不修改模型核心参数，保持预训练主干完整性，模块化设计可无缝集成到现有TTA框架

Result: 在减轻域偏移和增强模型鲁棒性方面优于传统方法，表现出强大的抗遗忘能力，在各种架构上实现一致的性能提升

Conclusion: Buffer层方法有效且通用，为实际域适应场景提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: In recent advancements in Test Time Adaptation (TTA), most existing
methodologies focus on updating normalization layers to adapt to the test
domain. However, the reliance on normalization-based adaptation presents key
challenges. First, normalization layers such as Batch Normalization (BN) are
highly sensitive to small batch sizes, leading to unstable and inaccurate
statistics. Moreover, normalization-based adaptation is inherently constrained
by the structure of the pre-trained model, as it relies on training-time
statistics that may not generalize well to unseen domains. These issues limit
the effectiveness of normalization-based TTA approaches, especially under
significant domain shift. In this paper, we introduce a novel paradigm based on
the concept of a Buffer layer, which addresses the fundamental limitations of
normalization layer updates. Unlike existing methods that modify the core
parameters of the model, our approach preserves the integrity of the
pre-trained backbone, inherently mitigating the risk of catastrophic forgetting
during online adaptation. Through comprehensive experimentation, we demonstrate
that our approach not only outperforms traditional methods in mitigating domain
shift and enhancing model robustness, but also exhibits strong resilience to
forgetting. Furthermore, our Buffer layer is modular and can be seamlessly
integrated into nearly all existing TTA frameworks, resulting in consistent
performance improvements across various architectures. These findings validate
the effectiveness and versatility of the proposed solution in real-world domain
adaptation scenarios. The code is available at

Conclusion: 测试匹配的数据增强与基于变换器的集成策略是在噪声条件下实现鲁棒人类活动识别的有效方法。

Abstract: We present a noise-aware, sensor-specific ensemble approach for robust human
activity recognition on the 2nd WEAR Dataset Challenge. Our method leverages
the PatchTST transformer architecture, training four independent models-one per
inertial sensor location-on a tampered training set whose 1-second sliding
windows are augmented to mimic the test-time noise. By aligning the train and
test data schemas (JSON-encoded 50-sample windows) and applying randomized
jitter, scaling, rotation, and channel dropout, each PatchTST model learns to
generalize across real-world sensor perturbations. At inference, we compute
softmax probabilities from all four sensor models on the Kaggle test set and
average them to produce final labels. On the private leaderboard, this pipeline
achieves a macro-F1 substantially above the baseline, demonstrating that
test-matched augmentation combined with transformer-based ensembling is an
effective strategy for robust HAR under noisy conditions.

TL;DR: DVC是一种预算感知的数据选择方法，专门针对多层感知机训练，通过分层评估数据贡献度，在预算约束下实现更优的训练效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数据选择方法存在关键局限：过度简化非线性变换、忽略隐藏层中间表示、计算复杂度高难以扩展到大型MLP。需要一种能考虑网络参数动态演化的数据评估方法。

Method: 提出DVC方法，将数据贡献分解为层值贡献(LVC)和全局值贡献(GVC)，使用6个精心设计的指标从质量、相关性和分布多样性三个维度评估数据，并结合UCB算法进行自适应源选择。

Result: 在6个数据集和8个基线方法上的广泛实验表明，DVC在各种预算约束下始终优于现有方法，实现了更高的准确率和F1分数。

Conclusion: DVC是首个系统处理神经网络分层数据评估的方法，为大规模机器学习系统提供了理论保证和实际优势。

Abstract: Data selection is one of the fundamental problems in neural network training,
particularly for multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) where identifying the most
valuable training samples from massive, multi-source, and heterogeneous data
sources under budget constraints poses significant challenges. Existing data
selection methods, including coreset construction, data Shapley values, and
influence functions, suffer from critical limitations: they oversimplify
nonlinear transformations, ignore informative intermediate representations in
hidden layers, or fail to scale to larger MLPs due to high computational
complexity. In response, we propose DVC (Data Value Contribution), a novel
budget-aware method for evaluating and selecting data for MLP training that
accounts for the dynamic evolution of network parameters during training. The
DVC method decomposes data contribution into Layer Value Contribution (LVC) and
Global Value Contribution (GVC), employing six carefully designed metrics and
corresponding efficient algorithms to capture data characteristics across three
dimensions--quality, relevance, and distributional diversity--at different
granularities. DVC integrates these assessments with an Upper Confidence Bound
(UCB) algorithm for adaptive source selection that balances exploration and
exploitation. Extensive experiments across six datasets and eight baselines
demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms existing approaches under
various budget constraints, achieving superior accuracy and F1 scores. Our
approach represents the first systematic treatment of hierarchical data
evaluation for neural networks, providing both theoretical guarantees and
practical advantages for large-scale machine learning systems.

Motivation: 挑战关于GAMs解释生成计算效率的假设，研究在不同条件下生成GAMs解释的计算复杂性。

Method: 通过计算复杂性理论分析，在P!=NP等标准假设下，研究不同形式的GAMs在各种上下文中的解释生成复杂性。

Result: 发现：(1)GAMs解释复杂性受输入空间结构影响；(2)组件模型类型差异只在特定输入域下显现；(3)回归与分类任务解释复杂性不同；(4)将复杂模型表示为可加形式（如神经可加模型）在某些条件下可简化解释。

Conclusion: 为GAMs解释计算的可行性提供了严格的理论框架，揭示了在何种条件下这些计算是可能的或已被证明是困难的。

Abstract: Generalized Additive Models (GAMs) are commonly considered *interpretable*
within the ML community, as their structure makes the relationship between
inputs and outputs relatively understandable. Therefore, it may seem natural to
hypothesize that obtaining meaningful explanations for GAMs could be performed
efficiently and would not be computationally infeasible. In this work, we
challenge this hypothesis by analyzing the *computational complexity* of
generating different explanations for various forms of GAMs across multiple
contexts. Our analysis reveals a surprisingly diverse landscape of both
positive and negative complexity outcomes. Particularly, under standard
complexity assumptions such as P!=NP, we establish several key findings: (1) in
stark contrast to many other common ML models, the complexity of generating
explanations for GAMs is heavily influenced by the structure of the input
space; (2) the complexity of explaining GAMs varies significantly with the
types of component models used - but interestingly, these differences only
emerge under specific input domain settings; (3) significant complexity
distinctions appear for obtaining explanations in regression tasks versus
classification tasks in GAMs; and (4) expressing complex models like neural
networks additively (e.g., as neural additive models) can make them easier to
explain, though interestingly, this benefit appears only for certain
explanation methods and input domains. Collectively, these results shed light
on the feasibility of computing diverse explanations for GAMs, offering a
rigorous theoretical picture of the conditions under which such computations
are possible or provably hard.

Motivation: 现实世界数据集通常包含未被检测或错误标记的异常，导致现有异常检测方法性能显著下降，且现有解决方案需要访问训练流程、数据或异常比例的先验知识，限制了实际应用。

Method: 提出EPHAD框架，在测试时使用从多模态基础模型（如CLIP）、经典AD方法（如潜在异常因子）或领域特定知识收集的证据来更新在污染数据集上训练的AD模型的输出。

Conclusion: EPHAD展示了在不同AD模型和证据对之间的多功能性和鲁棒性，为解决训练数据污染的异常检测问题提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Unsupervised anomaly detection (AD) methods typically assume clean training
data, yet real-world datasets often contain undetected or mislabeled anomalies,
leading to significant performance degradation. Existing solutions require
access to the training pipelines, data or prior knowledge of the proportions of
anomalies in the data, limiting their real-world applicability. To address this
challenge, we propose EPHAD, a simple yet effective test-time adaptation
framework that updates the outputs of AD models trained on contaminated
datasets using evidence gathered at test time. Our approach integrates the
prior knowledge captured by the AD model trained on contaminated datasets with
evidence derived from multimodal foundation models like Contrastive
Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP), classical AD methods like the Latent
Outlier Factor or domain-specific knowledge. We illustrate the intuition behind
EPHAD using a synthetic toy example and validate its effectiveness through
comprehensive experiments across eight visual AD datasets, twenty-six tabular
AD datasets, and a real-world industrial AD dataset. Additionally, we conduct
an ablation study to analyse hyperparameter influence and robustness to varying
contamination levels, demonstrating the versatility and robustness of EPHAD
across diverse AD models and evidence pairs. To ensure reproducibility, our
code is publicly available at https://github.com/sukanyapatra1997/EPHAD.

Conclusion: 该方法成功地将深度学习的表达能力与概率建模的严谨性相结合，为部分标签学习提供了一种高效且准确的解决方案。

Abstract: Real-world data is frequently noisy and ambiguous. In crowdsourcing, for
example, human annotators may assign conflicting class labels to the same
instances. Partial-label learning (PLL) addresses this challenge by training
classifiers when each instance is associated with a set of candidate labels,
only one of which is correct. While early PLL methods approximate the true
label posterior, they are often computationally intensive. Recent deep learning
approaches improve scalability but rely on surrogate losses and heuristic label
refinement. We introduce a novel probabilistic framework that directly
approximates the posterior distribution over true labels using amortized
variational inference. Our method employs neural networks to predict
variational parameters from input data, enabling efficient inference. This
approach combines the expressiveness of deep learning with the rigor of
probabilistic modeling, while remaining architecture-agnostic. Theoretical
analysis and extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets
demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in both
accuracy and efficiency.

Motivation: 现有研究主要关注建模选择对多重性的影响，而忽视了数据的关键作用。本文旨在从最细粒度的角度——单个数据点差异——来研究数据对多重性的影响。

Method: 提出了相邻数据集框架来分析单个数据点差异对多重性的影响，通过严格的数学证明验证发现，并将该框架扩展到主动学习和数据插补两个实际应用领域。

Result: 发现了一个反直觉的结果：类别分布重叠度更高的相邻数据集表现出更低的多重性，这源于共享的Rashomon参数。提出了新的多重性感知数据获取策略和数据插补技术。

Conclusion: 数据在塑造模型多重性中起着关键作用，相邻数据集的分析框架为理解和缓解多重性提供了新的视角，并在主动学习和数据插补中展示了实际应用价值。

Abstract: Multiplicity -- the existence of distinct models with comparable performance
-- has received growing attention in recent years. While prior work has largely
emphasized modelling choices, the critical role of data in shaping multiplicity
has been comparatively overlooked. In this work, we introduce a neighbouring
datasets framework to examine the most granular case: the impact of a
single-data-point difference on multiplicity. Our analysis yields a seemingly
counterintuitive finding: neighbouring datasets with greater inter-class
distribution overlap exhibit lower multiplicity. This reversal of conventional
expectations arises from a shared Rashomon parameter, and we substantiate it
with rigorous proofs.
  Building on this foundation, we extend our framework to two practical
domains: active learning and data imputation. For each, we establish natural
extensions of the neighbouring datasets perspective, conduct the first
systematic study of multiplicity in existing algorithms, and finally, propose
novel multiplicity-aware methods, namely, multiplicity-aware data acquisition
strategies for active learning and multiplicity-aware data imputation
techniques.

*Dhruv Sarkar,Nishant Pandey,Sayak Ray Chowdhury*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种简单而有效的算法，通过初始均匀探索阶段后接标准UCB算法，实现了近乎最优的Nash遗憾，并能扩展到更广泛的p-均值遗憾公平度量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统随机多臂老虎机中的遗憾度量无法解决奖励分配的公平性问题，特别是在需要公平分配奖励的场景中，如临床试验中的患者分配。

Method: 采用初始均匀探索阶段后接标准上置信界(UCB)算法，仅依赖加法Hoeffding界，可自然扩展到亚高斯奖励分布。

Result: 该算法实现了近乎最优的Nash遗憾，并能推广到p-均值遗憾这一更广泛的公平度量类别，在所有p值上获得(近乎)最优的遗憾界。

Conclusion: 相比现有需要专门算法设计和强假设的方法，本文提出的简单算法在更弱的假设下实现了更好的性能，能够统一处理多种公平度量。

Abstract: Regret in stochastic multi-armed bandits traditionally measures the
difference between the highest reward and either the arithmetic mean of
accumulated rewards or the final reward. These conventional metrics often fail
to address fairness among agents receiving rewards, particularly in settings
where rewards are distributed across a population, such as patients in clinical
trials. To address this, a recent body of work has introduced Nash regret,
which evaluates performance via the geometric mean of accumulated rewards,
aligning with the Nash social welfare function known for satisfying fairness
axioms.
  To minimize Nash regret, existing approaches require specialized algorithm
designs and strong assumptions, such as multiplicative concentration
inequalities and bounded, non-negative rewards, making them unsuitable for even
Gaussian reward distributions. We demonstrate that an initial uniform
exploration phase followed by a standard Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) algorithm
achieves near-optimal Nash regret, while relying only on additive Hoeffding
bounds, and naturally extending to sub-Gaussian rewards. Furthermore, we
generalize the algorithm to a broad class of fairness metrics called the
$p$-mean regret, proving (nearly) optimal regret bounds uniformly across all
$p$ values. This is in contrast to prior work, which made extremely restrictive
assumptions on the bandit instances and even then achieved suboptimal regret
bounds.

*Xuan Tang,Jichu Li,Difan Zou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了首个分析自适应优化器在浮点量化下的收敛性理论框架，解释了低精度训练有效的理论原因，并比较了Adam和Muon对量化误差的敏感性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型的快速扩展使得低精度训练变得至关重要，但现有收敛理论假设所有组件都是精确的，忽略了硬件感知量化，无法解释为什么低精度训练仍然有效。

Method: 引入理论框架分析自适应优化器（包括Adam和Muon）在梯度、权重和优化器状态的浮点量化下的收敛性，推导平滑非凸目标上的收敛速率。

Result: 只要尾数长度随迭代次数对数增长，两种算法都能保持接近全精度对应物的收敛速率。Adam对权重和第二矩量化高度敏感，而Muon需要更弱的误差控制，因此可能更稳健。

Conclusion: 这些结果缩小了低精度训练方法的经验成功与理论理解之间的差距，数值实验验证了理论分析。

Abstract: The rapid scaling of large language models (LLMs) has made low-precision
training essential for reducing memory, improving efficiency, and enabling
larger models and datasets. Existing convergence theories for adaptive
optimizers, however, assume all components are exact and neglect hardware-aware
quantization, leaving open the question of why low-precision training remains
effective. We introduce the first theoretical framework for analyzing the
convergence of adaptive optimizers, including Adam and Muon, under
floating-point quantization of gradients, weights, and optimizer states (e.g.,
moment estimates). Within this framework, we derive convergence rates on smooth
non-convex objectives under standard stochastic gradient assumptions,
explicitly characterizing how quantization errors from different components
affect convergence. We show that both algorithms retain rates close to their
full-precision counterparts provided mantissa length scales only
logarithmically with the number of iterations. Our analysis further reveals
that Adam is highly sensitive to weights and second-moment quantization due to
its reliance on $\beta_2 \to 1$, while Muon requires weaker error control and
is thus potentially more robust. These results narrow the gap between empirical
success and theoretical understanding of low-precision training methods.
Numerical experiments on synthetic and real-world data corroborate our theory.

### [73] [Leverage Unlearning to Sanitize LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21322)
*Antoine Boutet,Lucas Magnana*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SANI是一种语言模型遗忘方法，通过擦除和修复两个阶段来清除模型对敏感信息的记忆，无需昂贵的额外微调。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预训练大语言模型在特定任务微调时会记忆敏感数据，存在隐私泄露风险，需要一种无需重新训练的安全清理方法。

Method: 采用两阶段方法：1）重置模型最后层的特定神经元以破坏细粒度信息记忆；2）在避免记忆敏感信息的情况下微调模型。

Result: 仅需少量遗忘训练周期，模型就能被有效清理，信息泄露数量显著减少。

Conclusion: SANI为医院等行业提供了一种实用的模型清理方案，可在共享模型前有效保护敏感信息。

Abstract: Pre-trained large language models (LLMs) are becoming useful for various
tasks. To improve their performance on certain tasks, it is necessary to
fine-tune them on specific data corpora (e.g., medical reports, business data).
These specialized data corpora may contain sensitive data (e.g., personal or
confidential data) that will be memorized by the model and likely to be
regurgitated during its subsequent use. This memorization of sensitive
information by the model poses a significant privacy or confidentiality issue.
To remove this memorization and sanitize the model without requiring costly
additional fine-tuning on a secured data corpus, we propose SANI. SANI is an
unlearning approach to sanitize language models. It relies on both an erasure
and repair phases that 1) reset certain neurons in the last layers of the model
to disrupt the memorization of fine-grained information, and then 2) fine-tune
the model while avoiding memorizing sensitive information. We comprehensively
evaluate SANI to sanitize both a model fine-tuned and specialized with medical
data by removing directly and indirectly identifiers from the memorization of
the model, and a standard pre-trained model by removing specific terms defined
as confidential information from the model. Results show that with only few
additional epochs of unlearning, the model is sanitized and the number of
regurgitations is drastically reduced. This approach can be particularly useful
for hospitals or other industries that have already spent significant resources
training models on large datasets and wish to sanitize them before sharing.

TL;DR: 提出ScoreNF框架，结合归一化流和独立Metropolis-Hastings模块，用于从未归一化概率分布中进行高效无偏采样


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统MCMC方法收敛慢、存在临界减速问题，而基于似然的机器学习方法需要大量数据且容易发生模式覆盖和模式崩溃

Method: 基于归一化流架构的得分学习框架，集成独立Metropolis-Hastings模块，即使在小训练集下也能保持高性能

Result: 在合成2D分布和高维φ⁴晶格场理论分布上验证了方法的有效性，减少了计算昂贵的MCMC训练数据依赖

Conclusion: ScoreNF为复杂物理系统建模提供了一种高效采样方法，能够处理未归一化分布并评估模式行为

Abstract: Unnormalized probability distributions are central to modeling complex
physical systems across various scientific domains. Traditional sampling
methods, such as Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), often suffer from slow
convergence, critical slowing down, poor mode mixing, and high autocorrelation.
In contrast, likelihood-based and adversarial machine learning models, though
effective, are heavily data-driven, requiring large datasets and often
encountering mode covering and mode collapse. In this work, we propose ScoreNF,
a score-based learning framework built on the Normalizing Flow (NF)
architecture, integrated with an Independent Metropolis-Hastings (IMH) module,
enabling efficient and unbiased sampling from unnormalized target
distributions. We show that ScoreNF maintains high performance even with small
training ensembles, thereby reducing reliance on computationally expensive
MCMC-generated training data. We also present a method for assessing
mode-covering and mode-collapse behaviours. We validate our method on synthetic
2D distributions (MOG-4 and MOG-8) and the high-dimensional $\phi^4$ lattice
field theory distribution, demonstrating its effectiveness for sampling tasks.

TL;DR: RAVEN是一个鲁棒的弱到强泛化框架，通过动态学习弱模型的最优组合来解决分布偏移下弱监督强模型性能下降的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着超人类模型越来越复杂，人类可能无法有效监督其行为。现有弱到强泛化方法在分布偏移下会失效，导致强模型性能比弱监督者更差。

Method: 提出RAVEN框架，动态学习弱模型的最优组合以及强模型的参数，自动识别可信的监督源。

Result: 在图像分类、文本分类和偏好对齐任务上，RAVEN在分布外任务上比基线方法提升超过30%，在分布内任务上匹配或超越现有方法。

Conclusion: RAVEN能够有效解决分布偏移下的弱到强泛化问题，自动分配更高权重给更准确的弱模型，展现了识别可信监督的能力。

Abstract: As future superhuman models become increasingly complex, accurately
supervising their behavior may exceed human capabilities. Recent works have
demonstrated that in such scenarios, weak models can effectively supervise
strong models, a phenomenon known as weak-to-strong generalization. However, we
find that naive weak-to-strong generalization fails under distribution shifts,
often leading to worse performance of the strong model than its weak
supervisors. To address this, we propose RAVEN, a robust weak-to-strong
generalization framework that dynamically learns the optimal combinations of
weak models in addition to parameters of the strong model. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of RAVEN on image classification, text classification, and
preference alignment tasks. RAVEN outperforms alternative baselines by over 30%
on out-of-distribution tasks while matching or surpassing existing methods on
in-distribution tasks. Moreover, our results show that RAVEN assigns higher
weights to more accurate weak models, demonstrating its ability to
automatically identify trustworthy supervision.

Conclusion: 新提出的重参数化方法能够显著提高微调模型的泛化性能，为迁移学习提供了更有效的工具。

Abstract: Fine-tuning has proven to be highly effective in adapting pre-trained models
to perform better on new desired tasks with minimal data samples. Among the
most widely used approaches are reparameterization methods, which update a
target module by augmenting its frozen weight matrix with an additional
trainable weight matrix. The most prominent example is Low Rank Adaption
(LoRA), which gained significant attention in recent years. In this paper, we
introduce a new class of reparameterization methods for transfer learning,
designed to enhance the generalization ability of fine-tuned models. We
establish the effectiveness of our approach in a high-dimensional binary
classification setting using tools from Random Matrix Theory, and further
validate our theoretical findings through more realistic experiments, such as
fine-tuning LLMs.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出基于神经网络的稳健收益率曲线估计框架，专门针对小型抵押债券市场，解决了传统方法在稀疏数据和噪声环境下的过拟合和不稳定性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统收益率曲线估计方法（如自举法和Nelson-Siegel模型）在债券稀疏、价格波动大或包含难以去除噪声时，容易出现过度拟合或不稳定性问题，特别是在小型抵押债券市场中。

Method: 开发神经网络框架，逐日独立估计收益率曲线，并引入新的损失函数来强制平滑性和稳定性，同时允许集成领域特定约束（如与无风险基准对齐）。

Result: 在瑞典抵押债券上的实证结果表明，该方法比Nelson-Siegel-Svensson和Kernel-Ridge等方法产生更稳健和稳定的收益率曲线估计。

Conclusion: 该神经网络框架为小型债券市场提供了更可靠的收益率曲线估计工具，允许从业者根据需求在平滑性和准确性之间进行权衡。

Abstract: Robust yield curve estimation is crucial in fixed-income markets for accurate
instrument pricing, effective risk management, and informed trading strategies.
Traditional approaches, including the bootstrapping method and parametric
Nelson-Siegel models, often struggle with overfitting or instability issues,
especially when underlying bonds are sparse, bond prices are volatile, or
contain hard-to-remove noise. In this paper, we propose a neural networkbased
framework for robust yield curve estimation tailored to small mortgage bond
markets. Our model estimates the yield curve independently for each day and
introduces a new loss function to enforce smoothness and stability, addressing
challenges associated with limited and noisy data. Empirical results on Swedish
mortgage bonds demonstrate that our approach delivers more robust and stable
yield curve estimates compared to existing methods such as
Nelson-Siegel-Svensson (NSS) and Kernel-Ridge (KR). Furthermore, the framework
allows for the integration of domain-specific constraints, such as alignment
with risk-free benchmarks, enabling practitioners to balance the trade-off
between smoothness and accuracy according to their needs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MCTD虽然结合了扩散模型和树搜索进行轨迹探索，但受限于训练轨迹长度和局部规划，无法进行全局上下文感知的规划。

Method: 提出三个互补组件：在线组合器进行全局感知规划，分布式组合器通过并行起点降低搜索复杂度，预规划组合器利用缓存图加速推理。

Result: C-MCTD将规划从单个轨迹优化提升到完整计划组合的推理，实现了更有效的长轨迹规划。

Conclusion: C-MCTD通过组合式方法显著提升了MCTD的规划能力和效率，为长序列推理任务提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Monte Carlo Tree Diffusion (MCTD) integrates diffusion models with structured
tree search to enable effective trajectory exploration through stepwise
reasoning. However, MCTD remains fundamentally limited by training trajectory
lengths. While periodic replanning allows plan concatenation for longer plan
generation, the planning process remains locally confined, as MCTD searches
within individual trajectories without access to global context. We propose
Compositional Monte Carlo Tree Diffusion (C-MCTD), a framework that elevates
planning from individual trajectory optimization to reasoning over complete
plan compositions. C-MCTD introduces three complementary components: (1) Online
Composer, which performs globally-aware planning by searching across entire
plan compositions; (2) Distributed Composer, which reduces search complexity
through parallel exploration from multiple starting points; and (3) Preplan
Composer, which accelerates inference by leveraging cached plan graphs.

Motivation: 现有的文本到图像扩散模型（如Stable Diffusion）经常复制和放大社会偏见，特别是在性别和种族等人口统计属性方面。

Method: 集成公平主成分分析，将基于CLIP的输入嵌入投影到最小化群体特定信息同时保留语义内容的子空间中，并通过经验噪声注入和统一跨人口统计投影方法增强去偏效果。

Result: 在性别、种族和交叉设置上的广泛实验表明，FairImagen显著提高了公平性，在图像质量和提示保真度方面有适度权衡，优于现有的后处理方法。

Conclusion: FairImagen提供了一个简单、可扩展且模型无关的解决方案，用于实现公平的文本到图像生成。

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models, such as Stable Diffusion, have demonstrated
remarkable capabilities in generating high-quality and diverse images from
natural language prompts. However, recent studies reveal that these models
often replicate and amplify societal biases, particularly along demographic
attributes like gender and race. In this paper, we introduce FairImagen
(https://github.com/fuzihaofzh/FairImagen), a post-hoc debiasing framework that
operates on prompt embeddings to mitigate such biases without retraining or
modifying the underlying diffusion model. Our method integrates Fair Principal
Component Analysis to project CLIP-based input embeddings into a subspace that
minimizes group-specific information while preserving semantic content. We
further enhance debiasing effectiveness through empirical noise injection and
propose a unified cross-demographic projection method that enables simultaneous
debiasing across multiple demographic attributes. Extensive experiments across
gender, race, and intersectional settings demonstrate that FairImagen
significantly improves fairness with a moderate trade-off in image quality and
prompt fidelity. Our framework outperforms existing post-hoc methods and offers
a simple, scalable, and model-agnostic solution for equitable text-to-image
generation.

Conclusion: 提出的OTCIL框架通过前向正则化和贝叶斯自适应调节，在在线任务无关类增量学习中实现了高效决策和低累积遗憾，显著优于传统方法。

Abstract: Class incremental learning (CIL) requires an agent to learn distinct tasks
consecutively with knowledge retention against forgetting. Problems impeding
the practical applications of CIL methods are twofold: (1) non-i.i.d batch
streams and no boundary prompts to update, known as the harsher online
task-free CIL (OTCIL) scenario; (2) CIL methods suffer from memory loss in
learning long task streams, as shown in Fig. 1 (a). To achieve efficient
decision-making and decrease cumulative regrets during the OTCIL process, a
randomized neural network (Randomized NN) with forward regularization (-F) is
proposed to resist forgetting and enhance learning performance. This general
framework integrates unsupervised knowledge into recursive convex optimization,
has no learning dissipation, and can outperform the canonical ridge style (-R)
in OTCIL. Based on this framework, we derive the algorithm of the ensemble deep
random vector functional link network (edRVFL) with adjustable forward
regularization (-kF), where k mediates the intensity of the intervention.
edRVFL-kF generates one-pass closed-form incremental updates and variable
learning rates, effectively avoiding past replay and catastrophic forgetting
while achieving superior performance. Moreover, to curb unstable penalties
caused by non-i.i.d and mitigate intractable tuning of -kF in OTCIL, we improve
it to the plug-and-play edRVFL-kF-Bayes, enabling all hard ks in multiple
sub-learners to be self-adaptively determined based on Bayesian learning.
Experiments were conducted on 2 image datasets including 6 metrics, dynamic
performance, ablation tests, and compatibility, which distinctly validates the
efficacy of our OTCIL frameworks with -kF-Bayes and -kF styles.

Abstract: In this paper, we address the problem of \emph{cost-sensitive} hyperparameter
optimization (HPO) built upon freeze-thaw Bayesian optimization (BO).
Specifically, we assume a scenario where users want to early-stop the HPO
process when the expected performance improvement is not satisfactory with
respect to the additional computational cost. Motivated by this scenario, we
introduce \emph{utility} in the freeze-thaw framework, a function describing
the trade-off between the cost and performance that can be estimated from the
user's preference data. This utility function, combined with our novel
acquisition function and stopping criterion, allows us to dynamically continue
training the configuration that we expect to maximally improve the utility in
the future, and also automatically stop the HPO process around the maximum
utility. Further, we improve the sample efficiency of existing freeze-thaw
methods with transfer learning to develop a specialized surrogate model for the
cost-sensitive HPO problem. We validate our algorithm on established
multi-fidelity HPO benchmarks and show that it outperforms all the previous
freeze-thaw BO and transfer-BO baselines we consider, while achieving a
significantly better trade-off between the cost and performance. Our code is
publicly available at https://github.com/db-Lee/CFBO.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) systems increasingly match or surpass human
experts in biomedical signal interpretation. However, their effective
integration into clinical practice requires more than high predictive accuracy.
Clinicians must discern \textit{when} and \textit{why} to trust algorithmic
recommendations. This work presents an application-grounded user study with
eight professional sleep medicine practitioners, who score nocturnal arousal
events in polysomnographic data under three conditions: (i) manual scoring,
(ii) black-box (BB) AI assistance, and (iii) transparent white-box (WB) AI
assistance. Assistance is provided either from the \textit{start} of scoring or
as a post-hoc quality-control (\textit{QC}) review. We systematically evaluate
how the type and timing of assistance influence event-level and clinically most
relevant count-based performance, time requirements, and user experience. When
evaluated against the clinical standard used to train the AI, both AI and
human-AI teams significantly outperform unaided experts, with collaboration
also reducing inter-rater variability. Notably, transparent AI assistance
applied as a targeted QC step yields median event-level performance
improvements of approximately 30\% over black-box assistance, and QC timing
further enhances count-based outcomes. While WB and QC approaches increase the
time required for scoring, start-time assistance is faster and preferred by
most participants. Participants overwhelmingly favor transparency, with seven
out of eight expressing willingness to adopt the system with minor or no
modifications. In summary, strategically timed transparent AI assistance
effectively balances accuracy and clinical efficiency, providing a promising
pathway toward trustworthy AI integration and user acceptance in clinical
workflows.

Abstract: Recent disentangled representation learning (DRL) methods heavily rely on
factor specific strategies-either learning objectives for attributes or model
architectures for objects-to embed inductive biases. Such divergent approaches
result in significant overhead when novel factors of variation do not align
with prior assumptions, such as statistical independence or spatial
exclusivity, or when multiple factors coexist, as practitioners must redesign
architectures or objectives. To address this, we propose a compositional bias,
a modular inductive bias decoupled from both objectives and architectures. Our
key insight is that different factors obey distinct recombination rules in the
data distribution: global attributes are mutually exclusive, e.g., a face has
one nose, while objects share a common support (any subset of objects can
co-exist). We therefore randomly remix latents according to factor-specific
rules, i.e., a mixing strategy, and force the encoder to discover whichever
factor structure the mixing strategy reflects through two complementary
objectives: (i) a prior loss that ensures every remix decodes into a realistic
image, and (ii) the compositional consistency loss introduced by Wiedemer et
al. (arXiv:2310.05327), which aligns each composite image with its
corresponding composite latent. Under this general framework, simply adjusting
the mixing strategy enables disentanglement of attributes, objects, and even
both, without modifying the objectives or architectures. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our method shows competitive performance in both attribute and
object disentanglement, and uniquely achieves joint disentanglement of global
style and objects. Code is available at

Conclusion: 大语言模型不仅是研究类人学习系统表征动态的强大工具，也是生成关于大脑记忆重组原理新假说的可访问通用计算模型

Abstract: Associative learning--forming links between co-occurring items--is
fundamental to human cognition, reshaping internal representations in complex
ways. Testing hypotheses on how representational changes occur in biological
systems is challenging, but large language models (LLMs) offer a scalable
alternative. Building on LLMs' in-context learning, we adapt a cognitive
neuroscience associative learning paradigm and investigate how representations
evolve across six models. Our initial findings reveal a non-monotonic pattern
consistent with the Non-Monotonic Plasticity Hypothesis, with moderately
similar items differentiating after learning. Leveraging the controllability of
LLMs, we further show that this differentiation is modulated by the overlap of
associated items with the broader vocabulary--a factor we term vocabulary
interference, capturing how new associations compete with prior knowledge. We
find that higher vocabulary interference amplifies differentiation, suggesting
that representational change is influenced by both item similarity and global
competition. Our findings position LLMs not only as powerful tools for studying
representational dynamics in human-like learning systems, but also as
accessible and general computational models for generating new hypotheses about
the principles underlying memory reorganization in the brain.

*Guanxiong Luo,Shoujin Huang,Yanlong Yang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出自扩散框架，无需预训练生成模型即可解决逆问题，通过交替加噪和去噪步骤迭代优化解估计


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统扩散方法需要预训练模型学习去噪过程，而自扩散旨在开发自包含的迭代过程，不依赖预训练模型

Method: 使用随机初始化的单卷积网络作为自去噪器，通过数据保真度损失连续训练，在加噪和去噪步骤间交替进行

Result: 在线性逆问题上表现出色，性能优于或与现有方法相当

Conclusion: 自扩散框架灵活适应各种前向算子和噪声观测，具有广泛应用潜力

Abstract: We propose self-diffusion, a novel framework for solving inverse problems
without relying on pretrained generative models. Traditional diffusion-based
approaches require training a model on a clean dataset to learn to reverse the
forward noising process. This model is then used to sample clean solutions --
corresponding to posterior sampling from a Bayesian perspective -- that are
consistent with the observed data under a specific task. In contrast,
self-diffusion introduces a self-contained iterative process that alternates
between noising and denoising steps to progressively refine its estimate of the
solution. At each step of self-diffusion, noise is added to the current
estimate, and a self-denoiser, which is a single untrained convolutional
network randomly initialized from scratch, is continuously trained for certain
iterations via a data fidelity loss to predict the solution from the noisy
estimate. Essentially, self-diffusion exploits the spectral bias of neural
networks and modulates it through a scheduled noise process. Without relying on
pretrained score functions or external denoisers, this approach still remains
adaptive to arbitrary forward operators and noisy observations, making it
highly flexible and broadly applicable. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our
approach on a variety of linear inverse problems, showing that self-diffusion
achieves competitive or superior performance compared to other methods.

### [87] [A Rapid Physics-Informed Machine Learning Framework Based on Extreme Learning Machine for Inverse Stefan Problems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21426)
*Pei-Zhi Zhuang,Ming-Yue Yang,Fei Ren,Hong-Ya Yue,He Yang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于物理信息的极限学习机（PIELM）框架，用于解决逆Stefan问题，相比传统PINNs方法，在预测精度和训练效率方面都有显著提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统物理信息神经网络（PINNs）在解决Stefan问题时存在超参数依赖性强、训练效率低和预测精度不足的问题，需要开发更高效的物理信息学习方法。

Method: 使用极限学习机网络替代传统深度神经网络，固定输入权重，通过优化由初始边界条件和控制偏微分方程组成的物理定律损失向量来确定输出权重，将逆Stefan问题转化为寻找Moore-Penrose广义逆的最小二乘问题。

Result: 案例研究表明，PIELM相比传统PINNs方法，相对L2误差提高了3-7个数量级的预测精度，同时节省了超过94%的训练时间。

Conclusion: PIELM框架为逆Stefan问题提供了一种快速、准确的物理信息学习方法，显著提升了计算效率和预测精度。

Abstract: The inverse Stefan problem, as a typical phase-change problem with moving
boundaries, finds extensive applications in science and engineering. Recent
years have seen the applications of physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) to
solving Stefan problems, yet they still exhibit shortcomings in hyperparameter
dependency, training efficiency, and prediction accuracy. To address this, this
paper develops a physics-informed extreme learning machine (PIELM), a rapid
physics-informed learning method framework for inverse Stefan problems. PIELM
replaces conventional deep neural networks with an extreme learning machine
network. The input weights are fixed in the PIELM framework, and the output
weights are determined by optimizing a loss vector of physical laws composed by
initial and boundary conditions and governing partial differential equations
(PDEs). Then, solving inverse Stefan problems is transformed into finding the
Moore-Penrose generalized inverse by the least squares method. Case studies
show that the PIELM can increase the prediction accuracy by 3-7 order of
magnitude in terms of the relative L2 error, and meanwhile saving more than 94%
training time, compared to conventional PINNs.

*Hao Liang,Shuqing Shi,Yudi Zhang,Biwei Huang,Yali Du*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GSAC框架结合因果表示学习和元actor-critic学习，通过稀疏局部因果掩码和近似紧凑表示实现大规模网络系统的可扩展性和领域泛化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大规模网络系统（如交通、电力、无线网络）中强化学习面临的规模和环境变化挑战，需要同时实现可扩展性和领域泛化能力。

Method: 每个智能体学习稀疏局部因果掩码识别影响其动态的最小邻域变量，获得近似紧凑表示；元actor-critic在多个源域上训练共享策略，并基于紧凑域因子进行条件化；测试时通过少量轨迹估计新域因子并部署适应策略。

Result: GSAC在因果恢复、actor-critic收敛和适应差距方面具有有限样本保证，能够快速适应并显著优于从零学习和传统适应基线方法。

Conclusion: GSAC框架成功解决了大规模网络系统中强化学习的可扩展性和领域泛化问题，通过因果表示和元学习实现了高效的学习和快速适应。

Abstract: Large-scale networked systems, such as traffic, power, and wireless grids,
challenge reinforcement-learning agents with both scale and environment shifts.
To address these challenges, we propose GSAC (Generalizable and Scalable
Actor-Critic), a framework that couples causal representation learning with
meta actor-critic learning to achieve both scalability and domain
generalization. Each agent first learns a sparse local causal mask that
provably identifies the minimal neighborhood variables influencing its
dynamics, yielding exponentially tight approximately compact representations
(ACRs) of state and domain factors. These ACRs bound the error of truncating
value functions to $\kappa$-hop neighborhoods, enabling efficient learning on
graphs. A meta actor-critic then trains a shared policy across multiple source
domains while conditioning on the compact domain factors; at test time, a few
trajectories suffice to estimate the new domain factor and deploy the adapted
policy. We establish finite-sample guarantees on causal recovery, actor-critic
convergence, and adaptation gap, and show that GSAC adapts rapidly and
significantly outperforms learning-from-scratch and conventional adaptation
baselines.

*Zhuojing Tian,Yushu Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出统一令牌表示(UTR)方法，将离线强化学习中的回报、状态和动作合并为单个令牌，显著减少序列长度和模型复杂度，在保持性能的同时大幅降低计算开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于Transformer的离线强化学习方法存在令牌冗余和二次注意力复杂度问题，限制了在实时或资源受限环境中的可扩展性。

Method: 开发统一令牌表示(UTR)，将回报、状态和动作合并为单个令牌；基于此构建UDT(Transformer骨干)和UDC(门控CNN骨干)两个变体。

Result: UTR方法在保持或超越现有最优方法性能的同时，显著降低了计算复杂度；理论分析显示UTR具有更紧的Rademacher复杂度界限，表明更好的泛化能力。

Conclusion: UTR方法在不同架构上都能良好泛化，为未来大规模决策模型提供了高效的基础框架。

Abstract: Transformers have demonstrated strong potential in offline reinforcement
learning (RL) by modeling trajectories as sequences of return-to-go, states,
and actions. However, existing approaches such as the Decision Transformer(DT)
and its variants suffer from redundant tokenization and quadratic attention
complexity, limiting their scalability in real-time or resource-constrained
settings. To address this, we propose a Unified Token Representation (UTR) that
merges return-to-go, state, and action into a single token, substantially
reducing sequence length and model complexity. Theoretical analysis shows that
UTR leads to a tighter Rademacher complexity bound, suggesting improved
generalization. We further develop two variants: UDT and UDC, built upon
transformer and gated CNN backbones, respectively. Both achieve comparable or
superior performance to state-of-the-art methods with markedly lower
computation. These findings demonstrate that UTR generalizes well across
architectures and may provide an efficient foundation for scalable control in
future large decision models.

*Federico Danieli,Pau Rodriguez,Miguel Sarabia,Xavier Suau,Luca Zappella*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ParaRNN是一个突破非线性RNN序列并行化障碍的框架，通过牛顿迭代和并行归约实现高达665倍的加速，成功训练了70亿参数的LSTM和GRU模型，性能媲美同等规模的Transformer和Mamba2架构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RNN的序列性质限制了并行计算能力，而现有的并行架构如Transformer和状态空间模型在线性约束下表达能力有限，无法建模复杂的非线性序列依赖关系。

Method: 将非线性递归关系转化为方程组，使用牛顿迭代结合自定义并行归约进行并行求解，实现非线性RNN的并行训练。

Result: 实现了665倍的加速比，成功训练70亿参数的LSTM和GRU模型，困惑度与同等规模的Transformer和Mamba2相当。

Conclusion: ParaRNN打破了非线性RNN的并行化障碍，为高效序列建模研究提供了开源框架，使研究人员能够大规模探索新的非线性RNN模型。

Abstract: Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) laid the foundation for sequence modeling,
but their intrinsic sequential nature restricts parallel computation, creating
a fundamental barrier to scaling. This has led to the dominance of
parallelizable architectures like Transformers and, more recently, State Space
Models (SSMs). While SSMs achieve efficient parallelization through structured
linear recurrences, this linearity constraint limits their expressive power and
precludes modeling complex, nonlinear sequence-wise dependencies. To address
this, we present ParaRNN, a framework that breaks the sequence-parallelization
barrier for nonlinear RNNs. Building on prior work, we cast the sequence of
nonlinear recurrence relationships as a single system of equations, which we
solve in parallel using Newton's iterations combined with custom parallel
reductions. Our implementation achieves speedups of up to 665x over naive
sequential application, allowing training nonlinear RNNs at unprecedented
scales. To showcase this, we apply ParaRNN to adaptations of LSTM and GRU
architectures, successfully training models of 7B parameters that attain
perplexity comparable to similarly-sized Transformers and Mamba2 architectures.
To accelerate research in efficient sequence modeling, we release the ParaRNN
codebase as an open-source framework for automatic training-parallelization of
nonlinear RNNs, enabling researchers and practitioners to explore new nonlinear
RNN models at scale.

TL;DR: 该论文提出将个性化解释作为推荐本身来学习，通过预测用户会为物品拍摄什么照片来生成有说服力的解释，从而提高推荐系统的可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解释复杂系统（如推荐系统）的输出对用户和公司都越来越重要。用户上传的照片可以强化或证明他们对物品的评价，因此预测用户会拍摄的照片可以作为最佳的说服论据。

Method: 提出一个形式化框架来估计给定（用户，照片）对的作者概率。使用TripAdvisor收集的餐厅评论数据（包含照片）进行验证，涵盖六个不同规模的城市。

Result: 通过预测用户可能拍摄的照片，推荐系统能够为其结果提供解释，从而增加系统的可靠性。同时，公司可以获得关于客户关注产品哪些方面的生动知识。

Conclusion: 将个性化解释作为推荐来学习是可行的，这种方法不仅能提高推荐系统的可信度，还能为企业提供有价值的客户洞察。

Abstract: Explaining the output of a complex system, such as a Recommender System (RS),
is becoming of utmost importance for both users and companies. In this paper we
explore the idea that personalized explanations can be learned as
recommendation themselves. There are plenty of online services where users can
upload some photos, in addition to rating items. We assume that users take
these photos to reinforce or justify their opinions about the items. For this
reason we try to predict what photo a user would take of an item, because that
image is the argument that can best convince her of the qualities of the item.
In this sense, an RS can explain its results and, therefore, increase its
reliability. Furthermore, once we have a model to predict attractive images for
users, we can estimate their distribution. Thus, the companies acquire a vivid
knowledge about the aspects that the clients highlight of their products. The
paper includes a formal framework that estimates the authorship probability for
a given pair (user, photo). To illustrate the proposal, we use data gathered
from TripAdvisor containing the reviews (with photos) of restaurants in six
cities of different sizes.

*Daan Caljon,Jente Van Belle,Wouter Verbeke*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: HINet提出了一种结合图神经网络和领域对抗训练的新方法，用于估计网络环境下的异质处理效应，解决了未知暴露映射和网络级协变量偏移的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有因果机器学习方法通常假设已知的暴露映射，这在现实中往往不切实际。此外，同质性倾向与处理分配机制的交互可能导致网络级协变量偏移，影响处理效应估计的准确性。

Method: HINet整合图神经网络与领域对抗训练，能够在未知暴露映射的情况下估计处理效应，同时减轻网络级协变量偏移的影响。

Result: 在合成和半合成网络数据集上的广泛实证评估证明了该方法的有效性。

Conclusion: HINet为解决网络环境下异质处理效应估计的挑战提供了一种有效方法，特别适用于未知暴露映射和存在网络级协变量偏移的情况。

Abstract: Estimating heterogeneous treatment effects in network settings is complicated
by interference, meaning that the outcome of an instance can be influenced by
the treatment status of others. Existing causal machine learning approaches
usually assume a known exposure mapping that summarizes how the outcome of a
given instance is influenced by others' treatment, a simplification that is
often unrealistic. Furthermore, the interaction between homophily -- the
tendency of similar instances to connect -- and the treatment assignment
mechanism can induce a network-level covariate shift that may lead to
inaccurate treatment effect estimates, a phenomenon that has not yet been
explicitly studied. To address these challenges, we propose HINet, a novel
method that integrates graph neural networks with domain adversarial training.
This combination allows estimating treatment effects under unknown exposure
mappings while mitigating the impact of (network-level) covariate shift. An
extensive empirical evaluation on synthetic and semi-synthetic network datasets
demonstrates the effectiveness of our approach.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决超图上少样本节点分类问题，现有超图神经网络（HNNs）虽然能有效编码高阶结构，但由于复杂的黑盒架构而存在过拟合和可扩展性问题。

Method: 基于线性化HNNs的统一公式，ZEN引入了权重矩阵的可处理闭式解和冗余感知传播方案，避免迭代训练并消除冗余自信息。

Result: 在11个真实世界超图基准测试中，ZEN在分类准确率上持续优于8个基线模型，同时实现高达696倍的加速。

Conclusion: ZEN不仅实现了表达能力和效率的平衡，其决策过程完全可解释，为数据集特征提供了洞察。

Abstract: Few-shot node classification on hypergraphs requires models that generalize
from scarce labels while capturing high-order structures. Existing hypergraph
neural networks (HNNs) effectively encode such structures but often suffer from
overfitting and scalability issues due to complex, black-box architectures. In
this work, we propose ZEN (Zero-Parameter Hypergraph Neural Network), a fully
linear and parameter-free model that achieves both expressiveness and
efficiency. Built upon a unified formulation of linearized HNNs, ZEN introduces
a tractable closed-form solution for the weight matrix and a redundancy-aware
propagation scheme to avoid iterative training and to eliminate redundant self
information. On 11 real-world hypergraph benchmarks, ZEN consistently
outperforms eight baseline models in classification accuracy while achieving up
to 696x speedups over the fastest competitor. Moreover, the decision process of
ZEN is fully interpretable, providing insights into the characteristic of a
dataset. Our code and datasets are fully available at

TL;DR: 本文扩展了Vapnik和Chervonenkis的经典框架，引入了均匀均值可估计性（UME-learnability）的概念，研究分布集合在任意估计器下是否允许均匀均值估计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统工作主要关注经验均值估计器的均匀收敛性（P-Glivenko-Cantelli原则），本文旨在超越这一限制，研究更一般的均匀均值估计问题。

Method: 在分布集合的均值向量空间上工作，分析均值向量的可分性条件，并构造非可分但UME可学习的分布集合。

Result: 证明了均值向量的可分性是UME可学习的充分条件，但非必要条件；建立了UME可学习集合的可数并集也是UME可学习的。

Conclusion: 解决了Cohen等人（2025）提出的猜想，为均匀均值估计理论提供了更完整的框架。

Abstract: We characterize conditions under which collections of distributions on
$\{0,1\}^\mathbb{N}$ admit uniform estimation of their mean. Prior work from
Vapnik and Chervonenkis (1971) has focused on uniform convergence using the
empirical mean estimator, leading to the principle known as $P-$
Glivenko-Cantelli. We extend this framework by moving beyond the empirical mean
estimator and introducing Uniform Mean Estimability, also called $UME-$
learnability, which captures when a collection permits uniform mean estimation
by any arbitrary estimator. We work on the space created by the mean vectors of
the collection of distributions. For each distribution, the mean vector records
the expected value in each coordinate. We show that separability of the mean
vectors is a sufficient condition for $UME-$ learnability. However, we show
that separability of the mean vectors is not necessary for $UME-$ learnability
by constructing a collection of distributions whose mean vectors are
non-separable yet $UME-$ learnable using techniques fundamentally different
from those used in our separability-based analysis. Finally, we establish that
countable unions of $UME-$ learnable collections are also $UME-$ learnable,
solving a conjecture posed in Cohen et al. (2025).

Motivation: 生成流网络能够根据奖励函数采样高奖励的复杂对象，但奖励函数通常从噪声数据中近似估计，导致学习策略存在认知不确定性。

Method: 构建一个基于多项式混沌展开的代理模型，通过少量训练好的流网络集合来学习奖励函数参数与流网络轨迹中每个步骤动作概率分布之间的关系。

Result: 该方法在离散和连续网格世界、符号回归以及贝叶斯结构学习任务中展示了良好的性能。

Conclusion: 提出的代理模型能够通过廉价的蒙特卡洛采样来估计在不确定奖励下的策略不确定性。

Abstract: Generative flow networks are able to sample, via sequential construction,
high-reward, complex objects according to a reward function. However, such
reward functions are often estimated approximately from noisy data, leading to
epistemic uncertainty in the learnt policy. We present an approach to quantify
this uncertainty by constructing a surrogate model composed of a polynomial
chaos expansion, fit on a small ensemble of trained flow networks. This model
learns the relationship between reward functions, parametrised in a
low-dimensional space, and the probability distributions over actions at each
step along a trajectory of the flow network. The surrogate model can then be
used for inexpensive Monte Carlo sampling to estimate the uncertainty in the
policy given uncertain rewards. We illustrate the performance of our approach
on a discrete and continuous grid-world, symbolic regression, and a Bayesian
structure learning task.

TL;DR: 提出统一模型(UM)解决8种灾后道路评估变体问题，通过单一神经网络实现多任务学习，显著减少训练时间和参数，在解质量和实时性上优于传统方法和单任务DRL方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统优化方法扩展性差且需要领域专业知识，现有深度强化学习方法采用单任务范式，缺乏对不断变化的操作需求的适应性，需要为每个问题变体训练单独模型。

Method: 使用现代transformer编码器-解码器架构，通过单一神经网络在多个问题配置上进行训练，捕捉共享结构知识，同时通过轻量级适配器机制适应变体特定约束，实现对新属性的高效微调。

Result: UM将训练时间和参数减少8倍，解质量比单任务DRL方法提高6-14%，比传统优化方法提高24-82%，在1000节点网络上实现1-10秒实时求解，微调实验显示能以最小成本有效整合未见属性。

Conclusion: UM推进了时间关键应用的神经组合优化，为基于无人机的灾后道路评估提供了计算高效、高质量且适应性强的解决方案。

Abstract: Post-disaster road assessment (PDRA) is essential for emergency response,
enabling rapid evaluation of infrastructure conditions and efficient allocation
of resources. Although drones provide a flexible and effective tool for PDRA,
routing them in large-scale networks remains challenging. Traditional
optimization methods scale poorly and demand domain expertise, while existing
deep reinforcement learning (DRL) approaches adopt a single-task paradigm,
requiring separate models for each problem variant and lacking adaptability to
evolving operational needs. This study proposes a unified model (UM) for drone
routing that simultaneously addresses eight PDRA variants. By training a single
neural network across multiple problem configurations, UM captures shared
structural knowledge while adapting to variant-specific constraints through a
modern transformer encoder-decoder architecture. A lightweight adapter
mechanism further enables efficient finetuning to unseen attributes without
retraining, enhancing deployment flexibility in dynamic disaster scenarios.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that the UM reduces training time and
parameters by a factor of eight compared with training separate models, while
consistently outperforming single-task DRL methods by 6--14\% and traditional
optimization approaches by 24--82\% in terms of solution quality (total
collected information value). The model achieves real-time solutions (1--10
seconds) across networks of up to 1,000 nodes, with robustness confirmed
through sensitivity analyses. Moreover, finetuning experiments show that unseen
attributes can be effectively incorporated with minimal cost while retaining
high solution quality. The proposed UM advances neural combinatorial
optimization for time-critical applications, offering a computationally
efficient, high-quality, and adaptable solution for drone-based PDRA.

TL;DR: 研究探索了使用探针作为训练信号时的Goodhart定律问题，发现基于探针的偏好优化比基于分类器的方法能更好地保持探针检测能力，且探针多样性益处有限，重新训练探针即可恢复高检测精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探针可以检测模型内部的不良行为（如欺骗或偏见），但将其作为训练目标时可能因Goodhart定律而失效，需要研究如何在训练中保持探针的可靠性。

Method: 提出了基于监督微调和直接偏好优化的两种方法，在毒性减少测试平台上评估探针精度下降程度，尝试了训练探针集成、保留未训练探针和训练后重新训练探针三种策略。

Result: 基于探针的偏好优化意外地比基于分类器的方法更好地保持了探针检测能力；探针多样性带来的实际益处有限，只需在优化后重新训练探针即可恢复高检测精度。

Conclusion: 基于探针的训练在某些对齐方法中是可行的，当重新训练可行时，探针集成基本上是不必要的。

Abstract: Probes trained on model activations can detect undesirable behaviors like
deception or biases that are difficult to identify from outputs alone. This
makes them useful detectors to identify misbehavior. Furthermore, they are also
valuable training signals, since they not only reward outputs, but also good
internal processes for arriving at that output. However, training against
interpretability tools raises a fundamental concern: when a monitor becomes a
training target, it may cease to be reliable (Goodhart's Law). We propose two
methods for training against probes based on Supervised Fine-tuning and Direct
Preference Optimization. We conduct an initial exploration of these methods in
a testbed for reducing toxicity and evaluate the amount by which probe accuracy
drops when training against them. To retain the accuracy of probe-detectors
after training, we attempt (1) to train against an ensemble of probes, (2)
retain held-out probes that aren't used for training, and (3) retrain new
probes after training.
  First, probe-based preference optimization unexpectedly preserves probe
detectability better than classifier-based methods, suggesting the preference
learning objective incentivizes maintaining rather than obfuscating relevant
representations. Second, probe diversity provides minimal practical benefit -
simply retraining probes after optimization recovers high detection accuracy.
Our findings suggest probe-based training can be viable for certain alignment
methods, though probe ensembles are largely unnecessary when retraining is
feasible.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为时空区域扭曲（SRD）的伪异常生成方法，通过增强弱监督视频异常检测模型对抗攻击的鲁棒性，显著提升了模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有弱监督视频异常检测模型容易受到对抗攻击的影响，但由于弱监督只提供视频级标签而需要帧级预测，传统对抗训练方法效果不佳。伪标签虽然能实现帧级对抗训练，但噪声严重影响性能。

Method: 提出时空区域扭曲（SRD）方法，通过对正常视频的局部区域应用严重增强来创建合成异常，同时保持时间一致性。将这些精确标注的合成异常与噪声伪标签结合，显著减少标签噪声。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，该方法显著提升了WSVAD模型对抗攻击的鲁棒性，整体AUROC性能平均比最先进方法高出71.0%。

Conclusion: SRD方法通过生成精确标注的合成异常，有效解决了弱监督视频异常检测中对抗训练面临的标签噪声问题，显著提升了模型鲁棒性。

Abstract: Weakly Supervised Video Anomaly Detection (WSVAD) has achieved notable
advancements, yet existing models remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks,
limiting their reliability. Due to the inherent constraints of weak
supervision, where only video-level labels are provided despite the need for
frame-level predictions, traditional adversarial defense mechanisms, such as
adversarial training, are not effective since video-level adversarial
perturbations are typically weak and inadequate. To address this limitation,
pseudo-labels generated directly from the model can enable frame-level
adversarial training; however, these pseudo-labels are inherently noisy,
significantly degrading performance. We therefore introduce a novel
Pseudo-Anomaly Generation method called Spatiotemporal Region Distortion (SRD),
which creates synthetic anomalies by applying severe augmentations to localized
regions in normal videos while preserving temporal consistency. Integrating
these precisely annotated synthetic anomalies with the noisy pseudo-labels
substantially reduces label noise, enabling effective adversarial training.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method significantly enhances the
robustness of WSVAD models against adversarial attacks, outperforming
state-of-the-art methods by an average of 71.0\% in overall AUROC performance
across multiple benchmarks. The implementation and code are publicly available
at https://github.com/rohban-lab/FrameShield.

Result: 在代码编辑评估中，ES相比最接近的竞争对手SARI提高了12%的皮尔逊相关性，比标准度量如BLEU提高了超过21%。当增加共享上下文时，ES的优势进一步扩大到20%和超过30%。

Conclusion: ES是一种有效的修订相似度度量方法，能够更好地与人类判断保持一致，特别是在处理共享内容较多的文档修订场景中表现出色。

Abstract: Many tasks revolve around editing a document, whether code or text. We
formulate the revision similarity problem to unify a wide range of machine
learning evaluation problems whose goal is to assess a revision to an existing
document. We observe that revisions usually change only a small portion of an
existing document, so the existing document and its immediate revisions share a
majority of their content. We formulate five adequacy criteria for revision
similarity measures, designed to align them with human judgement. We show that
popular pairwise measures, like BLEU, fail to meet these criteria, because
their scores are dominated by the shared content. They report high similarity
between two revisions when humans would assess them as quite different. This is
a fundamental flaw we address. We propose a novel static measure, Excision
Score (ES), which computes longest common subsequence (LCS) to remove content
shared by an existing document with the ground truth and predicted revisions,
before comparing only the remaining divergent regions. This is analogous to a
surgeon creating a sterile field to focus on the work area. We use
approximation to speed the standard cubic LCS computation to quadratic. In
code-editing evaluation, where static measures are often used as a cheap proxy
for passing tests, we demonstrate that ES surpasses existing measures. When
aligned with test execution on HumanEvalFix, ES improves over its nearest
competitor, SARI, by 12% Pearson correlation and by >21% over standard measures
like BLEU. The key criterion is invariance to shared context; when we perturb
HumanEvalFix with increased shared context, ES' improvement over SARI increases
to 20% and >30% over standard measures. ES also handles other corner cases that
other measures do not, such as correctly aligning moved code blocks, and
appropriately rewarding matching insertions or deletions.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于MADDPG-凸优化和联盟博弈的算法来解决空天地一体化边缘计算中的用户设备成本最小化问题，通过联合优化任务卸载比例、无人机轨迹规划、计算资源分配和用户设备关联来提升用户中心性能。

Motivation: 空天地一体化多接入边缘计算为低空经济提供灵活广域计算服务，但面临异构节点协调、移动性和网络变化建模、部分可观测环境下实时决策等挑战。

Method: 提出分层SAGIN-MEC架构，使用MADDPG算法优化连续时间决策，结合凸优化和联盟博弈方法处理混合和变维度决策。

Result: 仿真结果表明，相比基准算法，MADDPG-COCG显著降低了用户设备总成本、任务完成延迟和能耗，仅略微增加无人机能耗，并表现出优越的收敛稳定性和可扩展性。

Conclusion: MADDPG-COCG算法能有效解决SAGIN-MEC中的复杂优化问题，为低空经济提供高效的计算服务支持。

Abstract: Space-air-ground integrated multi-access edge computing (SAGIN-MEC) provides
a promising solution for the rapidly developing low-altitude economy (LAE) to
deliver flexible and wide-area computing services. However, fully realizing the
potential of SAGIN-MEC in the LAE presents significant challenges, including
coordinating decisions across heterogeneous nodes with different roles,
modeling complex factors such as mobility and network variability, and handling
real-time decision-making under partially observable environment with hybrid
variables. To address these challenges, we first present a hierarchical
SAGIN-MEC architecture that enables the coordination between user devices
(UDs), uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs), and satellites. Then, we formulate a UD
cost minimization optimization problem (UCMOP) to minimize the UD cost by
jointly optimizing the task offloading ratio, UAV trajectory planning,
computing resource allocation, and UD association. We show that the UCMOP is an
NP-hard problem. To overcome this challenge, we propose a multi-agent deep
deterministic policy gradient (MADDPG)-convex optimization and coalitional game
(MADDPG-COCG) algorithm. Specifically, we employ the MADDPG algorithm to
optimize the continuous temporal decisions for heterogeneous nodes in the
partially observable SAGIN-MEC system. Moreover, we propose a convex
optimization and coalitional game (COCG) method to enhance the conventional
MADDPG by deterministically handling the hybrid and varying-dimensional
decisions. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed MADDPG-COCG
algorithm significantly enhances the user-centric performances in terms of the
aggregated UD cost, task completion delay, and UD energy consumption, with a
slight increase in UAV energy consumption, compared to the benchmark
algorithms. Moreover, the MADDPG-COCG algorithm shows superior convergence
stability and scalability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决当前自动化ECG诊断系统在透明性和对未见病症泛化能力方面的不足，使AI诊断更符合临床工作流程。

Method: 使用预训练多模态模型对齐ECG和文本嵌入，通过LLM辅助、专家验证的过程构建结构化正负临床观察数据集，模拟鉴别诊断过程。

Result: 实证评估显示ZETA在零样本分类性能上具有竞争力，并在可解释性方面提供定性和定量证据，将预测基于具体的临床相关诊断特征。

Conclusion: ZETA展示了将ECG分析与结构化临床知识对齐的潜力，可构建更透明、可泛化且可信赖的AI诊断系统。

Abstract: Electrocardiogram (ECG) interpretation is essential for cardiovascular
disease diagnosis, but current automated systems often struggle with
transparency and generalization to unseen conditions. To address this, we
introduce ZETA, a zero-shot multimodal framework designed for interpretable ECG
diagnosis aligned with clinical workflows. ZETA uniquely compares ECG signals
against structured positive and negative clinical observations, which are
curated through an LLM-assisted, expert-validated process, thereby mimicking
differential diagnosis. Our approach leverages a pre-trained multimodal model
to align ECG and text embeddings without disease-specific fine-tuning.
Empirical evaluations demonstrate ZETA's competitive zero-shot classification
performance and, importantly, provide qualitative and quantitative evidence of
enhanced interpretability, grounding predictions in specific, clinically
relevant positive and negative diagnostic features. ZETA underscores the
potential of aligning ECG analysis with structured clinical knowledge for
building more transparent, generalizable, and trustworthy AI diagnostic
systems. We will release the curated observation dataset and code to facilitate
future research.

Motivation: 神经网络擅长处理非结构化数据但泛化能力差，经典算法保证正确性但缺乏灵活性，探索将两者结合能否提升图神经网络在分子预测任务上的表现。

Method: 在CLRS算法推理基准的24个经典算法上预训练图神经网络，然后用预训练模型初始化和冻结部分层，用于分子属性预测任务。

Result: 相比随机初始化基线，预训练模型在ogbg-molhiv任务上获得6%绝对增益，在ogbg-molclintox任务上获得3%增益，表现出一致的优势或持平。

Abstract: Neural networks excel at processing unstructured data but often fail to
generalise out-of-distribution, whereas classical algorithms guarantee
correctness but lack flexibility. We explore whether pretraining Graph Neural
Networks (GNNs) on classical algorithms can improve their performance on
molecular property prediction tasks from the Open Graph Benchmark: ogbg-molhiv
(HIV inhibition) and ogbg-molclintox (clinical toxicity). GNNs trained on 24
classical algorithms from the CLRS Algorithmic Reasoning Benchmark are used to
initialise and freeze selected layers of a second GNN for molecular prediction.
Compared to a randomly initialised baseline, the pretrained models achieve
consistent wins or ties, with the Segments Intersect algorithm pretraining
yielding a 6% absolute gain on ogbg-molhiv and Dijkstra pretraining achieving a
3% gain on ogbg-molclintox. These results demonstrate embedding classical
algorithmic priors into GNNs provides useful inductive biases, boosting
performance on complex, real-world graph data.

Conclusion: 深度神经网络通过层次化密度峰值构建语义表示，冗余神经元在正则化且训练误差为零时出现，有助于改善泛化性能。

Abstract: The goal of this thesis is to improve our understanding of the internal
mechanisms by which deep artificial neural networks create meaningful
representations and are able to generalize. We focus on the challenge of
characterizing the semantic content of the hidden representations with
unsupervised learning tools, partially developed by us and described in this
thesis, which allow harnessing the low-dimensional structure of the data.
Chapter 2. introduces Gride, a method that allows estimating the intrinsic
dimension of the data as an explicit function of the scale without performing
any decimation of the data set. Our approach is based on rigorous
distributional results that enable the quantification of uncertainty of the
estimates. Moreover, our method is simple and computationally efficient since
it relies only on the distances among nearest data points. In Chapter 3, we
study the evolution of the probability density across the hidden layers in some
state-of-the-art deep neural networks. We find that the initial layers generate
a unimodal probability density getting rid of any structure irrelevant to
classification. In subsequent layers, density peaks arise in a hierarchical
fashion that mirrors the semantic hierarchy of the concepts. This process
leaves a footprint in the probability density of the output layer, where the
topography of the peaks allows reconstructing the semantic relationships of the
categories. In Chapter 4, we study the problem of generalization in deep neural
networks: adding parameters to a network that interpolates its training data
will typically improve its generalization performance, at odds with the
classical bias-variance trade-off. We show that wide neural networks learn
redundant representations instead of overfitting to spurious correlation and
that redundant neurons appear only if the network is regularized and the
training error is zero.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有EEG基础模型难以泛化到不同采集协议、设备和电极配置的数据集，限制了在EEG领域的应用。

Method: 引入4D位置编码方案处理任意长度和电极配置的EEG信号，使用掩码自编码目标在92个数据集上预训练。

Conclusion: REVE展示了强大的泛化能力和精细的时空建模能力，支持标准化EEG研究并加速临床神经科学进展。

Abstract: Foundation models have transformed AI by reducing reliance on task-specific
data through large-scale pretraining. While successful in language and vision,
their adoption in EEG has lagged due to the heterogeneity of public datasets,
which are collected under varying protocols, devices, and electrode
configurations. Existing EEG foundation models struggle to generalize across
these variations, often restricting pretraining to a single setup, resulting in
suboptimal performance, in particular under linear probing. We present REVE
(Representation for EEG with Versatile Embeddings), a pretrained model
explicitly designed to generalize across diverse EEG signals. REVE introduces a
novel 4D positional encoding scheme that enables it to process signals of
arbitrary length and electrode arrangement. Using a masked autoencoding
objective, we pretrain REVE on over 60,000 hours of EEG data from 92 datasets
spanning 25,000 subjects, representing the largest EEG pretraining effort to
date. REVE achieves state-of-the-art results on 10 downstream EEG tasks,
including motor imagery classification, seizure detection, sleep staging,
cognitive load estimation, and emotion recognition. With little to no
fine-tuning, it demonstrates strong generalization, and nuanced spatio-temporal
modeling. We release code, pretrained weights, and tutorials to support
standardized EEG research and accelerate progress in clinical neuroscience.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为HOPSS的新数据生成算法，通过降采样和同源扰动方法，用更少的时间步长直接生成训练数据集，显著加速PDE数据生成过程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统数据驱动深度学习方法需要大量解对数据，这些数据通常通过传统数值方法生成，需要数千个时间步迭代，远多于训练所需的几十个，造成沉重的计算和时间开销。

Method: 首先从可靠求解器获取基础解函数，通过降采样对齐时间步；然后提出"同源扰动"方法：将两个解函数（一个作为主函数，另一个作为同源扰动项）与随机噪声结合，高效生成精度相当的PDE数据点；最后用这些数据点计算原方程右端项变化形成新的解对。

Result: 理论和实验结果表明HOPSS降低了时间复杂度。例如在Navier-Stokes方程上，生成10,000个样本仅需传统方法约10%的时间，且模型训练性能相当。

Conclusion: HOPSS算法能够同时加速数据集生成并保持模型训练所需的近似精度，为数据驱动深度学习方法提供了更高效的数据生成方案。

Abstract: Data-driven deep learning methods like neural operators have advanced in
solving nonlinear temporal partial differential equations (PDEs). However,
these methods require large quantities of solution pairs\u2014the solution
functions and right-hand sides (RHS) of the equations. These pairs are
typically generated via traditional numerical methods, which need thousands of
time steps iterations far more than the dozens required for training, creating
heavy computational and temporal overheads. To address these challenges, we
propose a novel data generation algorithm, called HOmologous Perturbation in
Solution Space (HOPSS), which directly generates training datasets with fewer
time steps rather than following the traditional approach of generating large
time steps datasets. This algorithm simultaneously accelerates dataset
generation and preserves the approximate precision required for model training.
Specifically, we first obtain a set of base solution functions from a reliable
solver, usually with thousands of time steps, and then align them in time steps
with training datasets by downsampling. Subsequently, we propose a "homologous
perturbation" approach: by combining two solution functions (one as the primary
function, the other as a homologous perturbation term scaled by a small scalar)
with random noise, we efficiently generate comparable-precision PDE data
points. Finally, using these data points, we compute the variation in the
original equation's RHS to form new solution pairs. Theoretical and
experimental results show HOPSS lowers time complexity. For example, on the
Navier-Stokes equation, it generates 10,000 samples in approximately 10% of
traditional methods' time, with comparable model training performance.

TL;DR: 本文提出了计算张量网络SHAP解释的通用框架，证明对于张量链结构的张量网络可以在多对数时间内并行计算SHAP，并将这一结果推广到决策树、树集成等模型，同时揭示了在二值化神经网络中宽度而非深度是SHAP计算的主要瓶颈。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SHAP解释对于简单模型可在多项式时间内计算，但对于神经网络等黑盒模型则变为NP难问题。本文旨在研究更广泛的张量网络模型的SHAP计算问题，特别是在神经网络抽象和压缩中广泛应用的张量网络。

Method: 提出了计算任意结构张量网络精确SHAP解释的通用框架，特别关注张量链结构，利用并行计算实现多对数时间复杂度的SHAP计算，并通过将二值化神经网络约简为张量网络表示来分析计算复杂度。

Result: 证明了张量链结构的张量网络可以在多对数时间内并行计算SHAP，这一结果可推广到决策树、树集成、线性模型和线性RNN等模型。同时发现对于二值化神经网络，当网络宽度固定时SHAP计算变得高效可处理，而深度固定时仍保持计算困难。

Conclusion: 张量网络为SHAP计算提供了高效的框架，张量链结构特别适合并行SHAP计算。在神经网络中，宽度而非深度是SHAP计算的主要计算瓶颈，这为模型设计和解释性提供了重要启示。

Abstract: Although Shapley additive explanations (SHAP) can be computed in polynomial
time for simple models like decision trees, they unfortunately become NP-hard
to compute for more expressive black-box models like neural networks - where
generating explanations is often most critical. In this work, we analyze the
problem of computing SHAP explanations for *Tensor Networks (TNs)*, a broader
and more expressive class of models than those for which current exact SHAP
algorithms are known to hold, and which is widely used for neural network
abstraction and compression. First, we introduce a general framework for
computing provably exact SHAP explanations for general TNs with arbitrary
structures. Interestingly, we show that, when TNs are restricted to a *Tensor
Train (TT)* structure, SHAP computation can be performed in *poly-logarithmic*
time using *parallel* computation. Thanks to the expressiveness power of TTs,
this complexity result can be generalized to many other popular ML models such
as decision trees, tree ensembles, linear models, and linear RNNs, therefore
tightening previously reported complexity results for these families of models.
Finally, by leveraging reductions of binarized neural networks to Tensor
Network representations, we demonstrate that SHAP computation can become
*efficiently tractable* when the network's *width* is fixed, while it remains
computationally hard even with constant *depth*. This highlights an important
insight: for this class of models, width - rather than depth - emerges as the
primary computational bottleneck in SHAP computation.

Conclusion: GFM框架成功地将少步生成模型推广到黎曼流形，在保持高质量生成的同时显著降低了推理计算成本。

Abstract: Geometric data and purpose-built generative models on them have become
ubiquitous in high-impact deep learning application domains, ranging from
protein backbone generation and computational chemistry to geospatial data.
Current geometric generative models remain computationally expensive at
inference -- requiring many steps of complex numerical simulation -- as they
are derived from dynamical measure transport frameworks such as diffusion and
flow-matching on Riemannian manifolds. In this paper, we propose Generalised
Flow Maps (GFM), a new class of few-step generative models that generalises the
Flow Map framework in Euclidean spaces to arbitrary Riemannian manifolds. We
instantiate GFMs with three self-distillation-based training methods:
Generalised Lagrangian Flow Maps, Generalised Eulerian Flow Maps, and
Generalised Progressive Flow Maps. We theoretically show that GFMs, under
specific design decisions, unify and elevate existing Euclidean few-step
generative models, such as consistency models, shortcut models, and meanflows,
to the Riemannian setting. We benchmark GFMs against other geometric generative
models on a suite of geometric datasets, including geospatial data, RNA torsion
angles, and hyperbolic manifolds, and achieve state-of-the-art sample quality
for single- and few-step evaluations, and superior or competitive
log-likelihoods using the implicit probability flow.

Result: 该方法能够生成保留源数据集全部相关结构的合成数据，包括成对和高阶相关性。

Conclusion: GCM方法为合成数据生成提供了新途径，在隐私保护数据共享、鲁棒模型训练和模拟方面具有潜在应用价值。

Abstract: The increasing need for data privacy and the demand for robust machine
learning models have fueled the development of synthetic data generation
techniques. However, current methods often succeed in replicating simple
summary statistics but fail to preserve both the pairwise and higher-order
correlation structure of the data that define the complex, multi-variable
interactions inherent in real-world systems. This limitation can lead to
synthetic data that is superficially realistic but fails when used for
sophisticated modeling tasks. In this white paper, we introduce Generative
Correlation Manifolds (GCM), a computationally efficient method for generating
synthetic data. The technique uses Cholesky decomposition of a target
correlation matrix to produce datasets that, by mathematical proof, preserve
the entire correlation structure -- from simple pairwise relationships to
higher-order interactions -- of the source dataset. We argue that this method
provides a new approach to synthetic data generation with potential
applications in privacy-preserving data sharing, robust model training, and
simulation.

Motivation: 现有任务感知蒸馏方法需要大量数据，但在实际场景中数据可能稀缺或获取成本高，因此需要开发小样本蒸馏方法。

Method: CoD策略系统性地注入反事实解释（CFEs），即能够以最小扰动翻转教师模型预测结果的输入，从而精确映射教师决策边界。

Result: 在多个数据集和LLM上的实验表明，CoD在小样本场景（8-512个样本）中优于标准蒸馏方法，仅使用基线方法一半的样本加上对应的CFEs就能提升性能。

Conclusion: 反事实解释在小样本知识蒸馏中具有重要作用，能够有效帮助学生模型模仿教师模型的决策边界，减少对大量数据的依赖。

Abstract: Knowledge distillation is a promising approach to transfer capabilities from
complex teacher models to smaller, resource-efficient student models that can
be deployed easily, particularly in task-aware scenarios. However, existing
methods of task-aware distillation typically require substantial quantities of
data which may be unavailable or expensive to obtain in many practical
scenarios. In this paper, we address this challenge by introducing a novel
strategy called Counterfactual-explanation-infused Distillation CoD for
few-shot task-aware knowledge distillation by systematically infusing
counterfactual explanations. Counterfactual explanations (CFEs) refer to inputs
that can flip the output prediction of the teacher model with minimum
perturbation. Our strategy CoD leverages these CFEs to precisely map the
teacher's decision boundary with significantly fewer samples. We provide
theoretical guarantees for motivating the role of CFEs in distillation, from
both statistical and geometric perspectives. We mathematically show that CFEs
can improve parameter estimation by providing more informative examples near
the teacher's decision boundary. We also derive geometric insights on how CFEs
effectively act as knowledge probes, helping the students mimic the teacher's
decision boundaries more effectively than standard data. We perform experiments
across various datasets and LLMs to show that CoD outperforms standard
distillation approaches in few-shot regimes (as low as 8-512 samples). Notably,
CoD only uses half of the original samples used by the baselines, paired with
their corresponding CFEs and still improves performance.

Abstract: Deploying reinforcement learning (RL) in safety-critical settings is
constrained by brittleness under distribution shift. We study
out-of-distribution (OOD) detection for RL time series and introduce DEEDEE, a
two-statistic detector that revisits representation-heavy pipelines with a
minimal alternative. DEEDEE uses only an episodewise mean and an RBF kernel
similarity to a training summary, capturing complementary global and local
deviations. Despite its simplicity, DEEDEE matches or surpasses contemporary
detectors across standard RL OOD suites, delivering a 600-fold reduction in
compute (FLOPs / wall-time) and an average 5% absolute accuracy gain over
strong baselines. Conceptually, our results indicate that diverse anomaly types
often imprint on RL trajectories through a small set of low-order statistics,
suggesting a compact foundation for OOD detection in complex environments.

TL;DR: 本文建立了在流行度调整块模型(PABM)下图聚类的理论极限，解决了现有模型的局限性。PABM引入了簇内和簇间连接的独立流行度参数，相比传统模型能更好地捕捉度异质性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图聚类模型如SBM和DCBM存在局限性：SBM假设顶点度均匀，DCBM在簇间应用统一的度校正。PABM旨在通过引入簇内和簇间连接的独立流行度参数来更好地建模现实世界图的度异质性。

Method: PABM模型为簇内和簇间连接分别引入独立的流行度参数，其期望邻接矩阵的秩在k到k²之间。研究表明需要包含k²个特征向量的谱嵌入方法才能充分捕捉结构信息。

Result: 证明了在PABM下，即使传统边密度信号消失，只要簇内和簇间流行度系数不同，聚类恢复仍然是可能的。数值实验表明包含k²个特征向量的谱聚类算法优于传统方法。

Conclusion: PABM捕捉了DCBM忽略的度异质性维度：连接模式的局部差异可以独立于全局边密度增强簇可分离性。谱聚类需要包含更多特征向量来充分利用PABM的丰富结构信息。

Abstract: This paper establishes the theoretical limits of graph clustering under the
Popularity-Adjusted Block Model (PABM), addressing limitations of existing
models. In contrast to the Stochastic Block Model (SBM), which assumes uniform
vertex degrees, and to the Degree-Corrected Block Model (DCBM), which applies
uniform degree corrections across clusters, PABM introduces separate popularity
parameters for intra- and inter-cluster connections. Our main contribution is
the characterization of the optimal error rate for clustering under PABM, which
provides novel insights on clustering hardness: we demonstrate that unlike SBM
and DCBM, cluster recovery remains possible in PABM even when traditional
edge-density signals vanish, provided intra- and inter-cluster popularity
coefficients differ. This highlights a dimension of degree heterogeneity
captured by PABM but overlooked by DCBM: local differences in connectivity
patterns can enhance cluster separability independently of global edge
densities. Finally, because PABM exhibits a richer structure, its expected
adjacency matrix has rank between $k$ and $k^2$, where $k$ is the number of
clusters. As a result, spectral embeddings based on the top $k$ eigenvectors
may fail to capture important structural information. Our numerical experiments
on both synthetic and real datasets confirm that spectral clustering algorithms
incorporating $k^2$ eigenvectors outperform traditional spectral approaches.

### [112] [On Uncertainty Calibration for Equivariant Functions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21691)
*Edward Berman,Jacob Ginesin,Marco Pacini,Robin Walters*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文首次系统研究了等变性与模型校准之间的关系，通过理论分析和实验验证了等变网络在不确定性估计方面的表现，揭示了对称性不匹配如何导致模型校准错误。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在数据稀疏场景（如机器人操作、分子物理等）中，等变网络能改善建模效果，不确定性估计能防止过度自信，但等变性与模型校准之间的关系尚未被系统研究。

Method: 通过证明等变性条件下不确定性校准误差（ECE和ENCE）的上下界，建立理论框架，并结合真实和模拟数据集进行数值实验，分析对称性不匹配、群大小以及偶然性和认知性不确定性的影响。

Result: 理论分析阐明了等变模型的泛化界限，实验验证了对称性不匹配会导致分类和回归任务中的校准错误，揭示了等变性与不确定性之间的复杂关系。

Conclusion: 等变性对模型校准有重要影响，对称性不匹配是导致模型校准错误的关键因素，这为在数据稀疏场景中设计更可靠的等变模型提供了理论指导。

Abstract: Data-sparse settings such as robotic manipulation, molecular physics, and
galaxy morphology classification are some of the hardest domains for deep
learning. For these problems, equivariant networks can help improve modeling
across undersampled parts of the input space, and uncertainty estimation can
guard against overconfidence. However, until now, the relationships between
equivariance and model confidence, and more generally equivariance and model
calibration, has yet to be studied. Since traditional classification and
regression error terms show up in the definitions of calibration error, it is
natural to suspect that previous work can be used to help understand the
relationship between equivariance and calibration error. In this work, we
present a theory relating equivariance to uncertainty estimation. By proving
lower and upper bounds on uncertainty calibration errors (ECE and ENCE) under
various equivariance conditions, we elucidate the generalization limits of
equivariant models and illustrate how symmetry mismatch can result in
miscalibration in both classification and regression. We complement our
theoretical framework with numerical experiments that clarify the relationship
between equivariance and uncertainty using a variety of real and simulated
datasets, and we comment on trends with symmetry mismatch, group size, and
aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties.

### [113] [Mechanistic Interpretability for Neural TSP Solvers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21693)
*Reuben Narad,Leonard Boussioux,Michael Wagner*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文首次将稀疏自编码器应用于Transformer旅行商问题求解器，揭示了神经网络内部学习到的几何特征，如边界检测器、聚类敏感特征和分隔符特征，为理解神经组合优化模型提供了新视角。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然基于Transformer的旅行商问题求解器能在毫秒内获得接近最优解，但这些模型作为黑盒运行，无法提供关于它们学习的几何模式或构建路径时使用的启发式方法的洞察。

Method: 使用强化学习训练指针网络处理100节点实例，然后在编码器的残差流上拟合稀疏自编码器，以发现可解释特征的过完备字典。

Result: 分析显示求解器自然发展出反映基本旅行商问题概念的特征：在凸包节点上激活的边界检测器、对局部密集区域响应的聚类敏感特征，以及编码几何分割的分隔符特征。

Conclusion: 这些发现首次提供了神经旅行商问题求解器在节点选择前计算内容的模型内部解释，证明了几何结构在没有显式监督的情况下出现，并为结合神经效率和算法可解释性的透明混合系统指明了路径。

Abstract: Neural networks have advanced combinatorial optimization, with
Transformer-based solvers achieving near-optimal solutions on the Traveling
Salesman Problem (TSP) in milliseconds. However, these models operate as black
boxes, providing no insight into the geometric patterns they learn or the
heuristics they employ during tour construction. We address this opacity by
applying sparse autoencoders (SAEs), a mechanistic interpretability technique,
to a Transformer-based TSP solver, representing the first application of
activation-based interpretability methods to operations research models. We
train a pointer network with reinforcement learning on 100-node instances, then
fit an SAE to the encoder's residual stream to discover an overcomplete
dictionary of interpretable features. Our analysis reveals that the solver
naturally develops features mirroring fundamental TSP concepts: boundary
detectors that activate on convex-hull nodes, cluster-sensitive features
responding to locally dense regions, and separator features encoding geometric
partitions. These findings provide the first model-internal account of what
neural TSP solvers compute before node selection, demonstrate that geometric
structure emerges without explicit supervision, and suggest pathways toward
transparent hybrid systems that combine neural efficiency with algorithmic
interpretability. Interactive feature explorer:

TL;DR: EbC方法从观察对(y, g·y)中学习等变嵌入，无需依赖群特定归纳偏置，成功实现了仅从群作用观察中学习通用编码器等变性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旨在从群作用观察中学习等变嵌入，而不依赖群特定的归纳偏置，实现通用编码器的等变学习。

Method: 联合学习潜在空间和群表示，使群作用对应可逆线性映射，通过对比学习实现等变性。

Result: 在dSprites数据集上实现了高保真等变性，群操作在潜在空间中忠实再现，在非阿贝尔正交群和一般线性群上也验证了有效性。

Conclusion: 这是首个仅从群作用观察中成功学习通用编码器等变性的方法，包括非平凡非阿贝尔群和乘积群，为计算机视觉中的仿射等变性建模提供了基础。

Abstract: We propose Equivariance by Contrast (EbC) to learn equivariant embeddings
from observation pairs $(\mathbf{y}, g \cdot \mathbf{y})$, where $g$ is drawn
from a finite group acting on the data. Our method jointly learns a latent
space and a group representation in which group actions correspond to
invertible linear maps -- without relying on group-specific inductive biases.
We validate our approach on the infinite dSprites dataset with structured
transformations defined by the finite group $G:= (R_m \times \mathbb{Z}_n
\times \mathbb{Z}_n)$, combining discrete rotations and periodic translations.
The resulting embeddings exhibit high-fidelity equivariance, with group
operations faithfully reproduced in latent space. On synthetic data, we further
validate the approach on the non-abelian orthogonal group $O(n)$ and the
general linear group $GL(n)$. We also provide a theoretical proof for
identifiability. While broad evaluation across diverse group types on
real-world data remains future work, our results constitute the first
successful demonstration of general-purpose encoder-only equivariant learning
from group action observations alone, including non-trivial non-abelian groups
and a product group motivated by modeling affine equivariances in computer
vision.

TL;DR: 提出MU-SplitFed算法解决Split Federated Learning中的straggler问题，通过非平衡更新机制实现线性加速


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Split Federated Learning结合了联邦学习和分割学习的优势，但面临严重的straggler问题，特别是在Split Server与客户端之间的依赖关系加剧了同步延迟

Method: 采用零阶优化方法，通过允许服务器在每个客户端轮次执行τ次本地更新，实现训练进度与straggler延迟的解耦

Result: 在非凸目标下达到O(√(d/(τT)))的收敛率，实验证明能有效缓解straggler影响并通过自适应调整τ获得更好性能

Conclusion: MU-SplitFed通过简单的非平衡更新机制成功解决了SFL中的straggler瓶颈问题，显著提升了系统的可扩展性和效率

Abstract: Split Federated Learning (SFL) enables scalable training on edge devices by
combining the parallelism of Federated Learning (FL) with the computational
offloading of Split Learning (SL). Despite its great success, SFL suffers
significantly from the well-known straggler issue in distributed learning
systems. This problem is exacerbated by the dependency between Split Server and
clients: the Split Server side model update relies on receiving activations
from clients. Such synchronization requirement introduces significant time
latency, making straggler a critical bottleneck to the scalability and
efficiency of the system. To mitigate this problem, we propose MU-SplitFed, a
straggler-resilient SFL algorithm in zeroth-order optimization that decouples
training progress from straggler delays via a simple yet effective unbalanced
update mechanism.
  By enabling the server to perform $\tau$ local updates per client round,
MU-SplitFed achieves a convergence rate of $O(\sqrt{d/(\tau T)})$ for
non-convex objectives, demonstrating a linear speedup of $\tau$ in
communication rounds. Experiments demonstrate that MU-SplitFed consistently
outperforms baseline methods with the presence of stragglers and effectively
mitigates their impact through adaptive tuning of $\tau$. The code for this
project is available at https://github.com/Johnny-Zip/MU-SplitFed.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 云消费者缺乏专业知识来实现SLA合规机制，且不同云提供商使用不同的低级指标，导致供应商锁定，阻碍多云环境的优势发挥

Method: 1) 智能知识系统将高级SLA转换为供应商中立指标条件；2) 定义供应商中立指标集并说明如何在不同云提供商中测量；3) 在由领先云提供商组成的多云环境中验证

Result: 通过两个用例(IaaS和PaaS)验证，证明解决方案使云消费者能够自动透明地利用多云环境

Conclusion: 该解决方案使云消费者能够在多云环境中自动透明地利用云服务，得到云专家认可

Abstract: Cloud computing has been consolidated as a support for the vast majority of
current and emerging technologies. However, there are some barriers that
prevent the exploitation of the full potential of this technology. First, the
major cloud providers currently put the onus of implementing the mechanisms
that ensure compliance with the desired service levels on cloud consumers.
However, consumers do not have the required expertise. Since each cloud
provider exports a different set of low-level metrics, the strategies defined
to ensure compliance with the established service-level agreement (SLA) are
bound to a particular cloud provider. This fosters provider lock-in and
prevents consumers from benefiting from the advantages of multi-cloud
environments. This paper presents a solution to the problem of automatically
translating SLAs into objectives expressed as metrics that can be measured
across multiple cloud providers. First, we propose an intelligent
knowledge-based system capable of automatically translating high-level SLAs
defined by cloud consumers into a set of conditions expressed as vendor-neutral
metrics, providing feedback to cloud consumers (intelligent tutoring system).
Secondly, we present the set of vendor-neutral metrics and explain how they can
be measured for the different cloud providers. Finally, we report a validation
based on two use cases (IaaS and PaaS) in a multi-cloud environment formed by
leading cloud providers. This evaluation has demonstrated that, thanks to the
complementarity of the two solutions, cloud consumers can automatically and
transparently exploit the multi-cloud in many application domains, as endorsed
by the cloud experts consulted in the course of this study.

Abstract: This paper proposes a generative adversarial network and federated
learning-based model to address various challenges of the smart prediction and
recommendation applications, such as high response time, compromised data
privacy, and data scarcity. The integration of the generative adversarial
network and federated learning is referred to as Generative Federated Learning
(GFL). As a case study of the proposed model, a heart health monitoring
application is considered. The realistic synthetic datasets are generated using
the generated adversarial network-based proposed algorithm for improving data
diversity, data quality, and data augmentation, and remove the data scarcity
and class imbalance issues. In this paper, we implement the centralized and
decentralized federated learning approaches in an edge computing paradigm. In
centralized federated learning, the edge nodes communicate with the central
server to build the global and personalized local models in a collaborative
manner. In the decentralized federated learning approach, the edge nodes
communicate among themselves to exchange model updates for collaborative
training. The comparative study shows that the proposed framework outperforms
the existing heart health monitoring applications. The results show that using
the proposed framework (i) the prediction accuracy is improved by 12% than the
conventional framework, and (ii) the response time is reduced by 73% than the
conventional cloud-only system.

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: 该论文提出了仲裁自由一致性(AFC)定理，揭示了仲裁自由性是区分无需协调的一致性模型与需要同步行为的基本属性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 分布式存储系统中可用性与一致性之间存在根本矛盾，现有理论只涵盖极端情况，缺乏对对象语义与一致性模型组合的精确解释。

Method: 开发了一个通用的语义框架，将操作语义和一致性模型结合，涵盖多种对象类型和一致性模型，并证明了AFC定理。

Result: 证明对象规范在一致性模型中具有可用实现的充要条件是该规范是仲裁自由的，即不需要总仲裁顺序来解决可见性或读取依赖。

Conclusion: AFC定理统一并推广了先前结果，揭示了仲裁自由性是协调自由一致性与固有同步行为之间的根本分界线。

Abstract: The fundamental tension between \emph{availability} and \emph{consistency}
shapes the design of distributed storage systems. Classical results capture
extreme points of this trade-off: the CAP theorem shows that strong models like
linearizability preclude availability under partitions, while weak models like
causal consistency remain implementable without coordination. These theorems
apply to simple read-write interfaces, leaving open a precise explanation of
the combinations of object semantics and consistency models that admit
available implementations.
  This paper develops a general semantic framework in which storage
specifications combine operation semantics and consistency models. The
framework encompasses a broad range of objects (key-value stores, counters,
sets, CRDTs, and transactional databases) and consistency models (from causal
consistency and sequential consistency to snapshot isolation and transactional
and non-transactional SQL).
  Within this framework, we prove the \emph{Arbitration-Free Consistency} (AFC)
theorem, showing that an object specification within a consistency model admits
an available implementation if and only if it is \emph{arbitration-free}, that
is, it does not require a total arbitration order to resolve visibility or read
dependencies.
  The AFC theorem unifies and generalizes previous results, revealing
arbitration-freedom as the fundamental property that delineates
coordination-free consistency from inherently synchronized behavior.

TL;DR: Parsley是一个基于组的弹性分布式哈希表，通过预对等节点重定位技术和动态数据分片机制提高鲁棒性和负载均衡。系统引入了软限制来主动维持稳定的组大小，防止违反硬限制，从而在节点变动下提升系统稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有分布式哈希表系统通常没有充分论证组大小限制参数的合理性。本文旨在通过系统性的覆盖网络特性研究，理解这些参数对性能和可扩展性的影响，为参数选择提供理论依据。

Method: 采用预对等节点重定位技术和动态数据分片机制，引入软限制和硬限制相结合的方法。通过系统性的覆盖网络特性研究，分析拓扑操作、大组行为以及整体权衡关系。

Result: 研究发现软限制能够有效预防硬限制的违反，显著提高系统在节点变动下的稳定性。通过参数化分析为系统配置提供了理论基础。

Conclusion: Parsley通过软硬限制结合的方法和系统性参数分析，为分布式哈希表的组大小管理提供了更可靠的理论基础和实践指导，显著提升了系统的鲁棒性和稳定性。

Abstract: Parsley is a resilient group-based Distributed Hash Table that incorporates a
preemptive peer relocation technique and a dynamic data sharding mechanism to
enhance robustness and balance. In addition to the hard limits on group size,
defined by minimum and maximum thresholds, Parsley introduces two soft limits
that define a target interval for maintaining stable group sizes. These soft
boundaries allow the overlay to take proactive measures to prevent violations
of the hard limits, improving system stability under churn. This work provides
an in-depth analysis of the rationale behind the parameter values adopted for
Parsley's evaluation. Unlike related systems, which specify group size limits
without justification, we conduct a systematic overlay characterization study
to understand the effects of these parameters on performance and scalability.
The study examines topology operations, the behavior of large groups, and the
overall trade-offs observed, offering a grounded explanation for the chosen
configuration values.

TL;DR: 提出了一种使用语义名称的分布式控制平面，用于在地理分散的计算集群上部署计算任务，替代传统的集中式控制器方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于Kubernetes等集中式控制器的计算任务部署方法不适用于多组织协作环境，且工作流通常需要针对单一平台的手动配置，无法适应基础设施的动态变化。

Method: 使用语义名称将计算任务与命名的Kubernetes服务端点进行匹配，实现去中心化的控制平面。

Result: 该方法使计算作业的部署与位置无关，允许任何具有足够资源的集群执行计算，并支持动态计算部署而无需预先了解集群位置或预定义配置。

Conclusion: 基于语义名称的分布式控制平面为地理分布式计算平台提供了更灵活、适应性更强的计算任务部署解决方案。

Abstract: Scientific communities are increasingly using geographically distributed
computing platforms. The current methods of compute placement predominantly use
logically centralized controllers such as Kubernetes (K8s) to match tasks to
available resources. However, this centralized approach is unsuitable in
multi-organizational collaborations. Furthermore, workflows often need to use
manual configurations tailored for a single platform and cannot adapt to
dynamic changes across infrastructure. Our work introduces a decentralized
control plane for placing computations on geographically dispersed compute
clusters using semantic names. We assign semantic names to computations to
match requests with named Kubernetes (K8s) service endpoints. We show that this
approach provides multiple benefits. First, it allows placement of
computational jobs to be independent of location, enabling any cluster with
sufficient resources to execute the computation. Second, it facilitates dynamic
compute placement without requiring prior knowledge of cluster locations or
predefined configurations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 分布式云环境中网络拥塞、带宽不对称和节点间数据混洗等因素导致应用性能下降，传统基于CPU/内存的主机级指标无法捕捉这些网络状况，造成调度决策不佳。

Method: 采用监督学习方法，收集所有节点的实时遥测数据，训练模型预测候选作业在各节点的完成时间，通过预测-排序机制选择最佳节点进行作业放置。

Result: 在FABRIC测试平台的分布式Kubernetes集群上评估，运行网络密集型Spark工作负载，相比默认Kubernetes调度器，节点选择准确率提高了34-54%。

Conclusion: 该研究展示了监督学习在多站点集群中实现实时网络感知作业调度的可行性，通过考虑网络状况显著改善了作业调度性能。

Abstract: Distributed cloud environments hosting data-intensive applications often
experience slowdowns due to network congestion, asymmetric bandwidth, and
inter-node data shuffling. These factors are typically not captured by
traditional host-level metrics like CPU or memory. Scheduling without
accounting for these conditions can lead to poor placement decisions, longer
data transfers, and suboptimal job performance. We present a network-aware job
scheduler that uses supervised learning to predict the completion time of
candidate jobs. Our system introduces a prediction-and-ranking mechanism that
collects real-time telemetry from all nodes, uses a trained supervised model to
estimate job duration per node, and ranks them to select the best placement. We
evaluate the scheduler on a geo-distributed Kubernetes cluster deployed on the
FABRIC testbed by running network-intensive Spark workloads. Compared to the
default Kubernetes scheduler, which makes placement decisions based on current
resource availability alone, our proposed supervised scheduler achieved 34-54%
higher accuracy in selecting optimal nodes for job placement. The novelty of
our work lies in the demonstration of supervised learning for real-time,
network-aware job scheduling on a multi-site cluster.

Abstract: Cycloids are particular Petri nets for modelling processes of actions and
events, belonging to the fundaments of Petri's general systems theory. Defined
by four parameters they provide an algebraic formalism to describe strongly
synchronized sequential processes. To further investigate their structure,
reduction systems of cycloids are defined in the style of rewriting systems and
properties of irreducible cycloids are proved. In particular the synthesis of
cycloid parameters from their Petri net structure is derived, leading to an
efficient method for a decision procedure for cycloid isomorphism.

Abstract: The distributed coloring problem is arguably one of the key problems studied
in the area of distributed graph algorithms. The most standard variant of the
problem asks for a proper vertex coloring of a graph with $\Delta+1$ colors,
where $\Delta$ is the maximum degree of the graph. Despite an immense amount of
work on distributed coloring problems in the distributed setting, determining
the deterministic complexity of $(\Delta+1)$-coloring in the standard message
passing model remains one of the most important open questions of the area. In
this paper, we aim to improve our understanding of the deterministic complexity
of $(\Delta+1)$-coloring as a function of $\Delta$ in a special family of
graphs for which significantly faster algorithms are already known. The
neighborhood independence $\theta$ of a graph is the maximum number of pairwise
non-adjacent neighbors of some node of the graph. In general, in graphs of
neighborhood independence $\theta=O(1)$ (e.g., line graphs), it is known that
$(\Delta+1)$-coloring can be solved in $2^{O(\sqrt{\log\Delta})}+O(\log^* n)$
rounds. In the present paper, we significantly improve this result, and we show
that in graphs of neighborhood independence $\theta$, a $(\Delta+1)$-coloring
can be computed in $(\theta\cdot\log\Delta)^{O(\log\log\Delta /
\log\log\log\Delta)}+O(\log^* n)$ rounds and thus in quasipolylogarithmic time
in $\Delta$ as long as $\theta$ is at most polylogarithmic in $\Delta$. We also
show that the known approach that leads to a polylogarithmic in $\Delta$
algorithm for $(2\Delta-1)$-edge coloring already fails for edge colorings of
hypergraphs of rank at least $3$.
