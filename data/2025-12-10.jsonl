As mechanisms of neuroplasticity have become better understood, vibration-based interventions have gained attention as potential tools to stimulate sensory pathways and motor circuits to support functional recovery. This survey reviews stochastic and resonant vibration modalities, describing their mechanisms, therapeutic rationales, and clinical applications. We synthesize evidence on whole-body vibration for improving balance, mobility, and fine motor function in aging adults, stroke survivors, and individuals with Parkinson's disease, with attention to challenges in parameter optimization, generalizability, and safety. We also assess recent developments in focused muscle vibration and wearable stochastic resonance devices for upper-limb rehabilitation, evaluating their clinical promise along with limitations in scalability, ecological validity, and standardization. Across these modalities, we identify key variables that shape therapeutic outcomes and highlight ongoing efforts to refine protocols, improve usability, and integrate vibration techniques into broader neurorehabilitation frameworks. We conclude by outlining the most important research needs for translating vibration-based interventions into reliable and deployable clinical tools."}

Hyperdimensional Computing (HDC) is a brain-inspired computing paradigm that encodes input features into low-precision, high-dimensional vectors with simple element-wise operations, making it well-suited for resource-constrained edge platforms. Recent work enhances HDC accuracy for graph classification via Nyström kernel approximations. Edge acceleration of such methods faces several challenges: (i) redundancy among (landmark) samples selected via uniform sampling, (ii) storing the Nyström projection matrix under limited on-chip memory, (iii) expensive, contention-prone codebook lookups, and (iv) load imbalance due to irregular sparsity in SpMV. To address these challenges, we propose NysX, the first end-to-end FPGA accelerator for Nyström-based HDC graph classification at the edge. NysX integrates four key optimizations: (i) a hybrid landmark selection strategy combining uniform sampling with determinantal point processes (DPPs) to reduce redundancy while improving accuracy; (ii) a streaming architecture for Nyström projection matrix maximizing external memory bandwidth utilization; (iii) a minimal-perfect-hash lookup engine enabling $O(1)$ key-to-index mapping with low on-chip memory overhead; and (iv) sparsity-aware SpMV engines with static load balancing. Together, these innovations enable real-time, energy-efficient inference on resource-constrained platforms. Implemented on an AMD Zynq UltraScale+ (ZCU104) FPGA, NysX achieves $6.85\\times$ ($4.32\\times$) speedup and $169\\times$ ($314\\times$) energy efficiency gains over optimized CPU (GPU) baselines, while improving classification accuracy by $3.4\\%$ on average across TUDataset benchmarks, a widely used standard for graph classification."}

After performing an evaluation in several domains, it is highly informative to compute a (weighted) mean performance and, as shown in this paper, to scrutinize what happens during this averaging. To achieve this goal, we adopt a probabilistic framework and consider a performance as a probability measure (e.g., a normalized confusion matrix for a classification task). It appears that the corresponding weighted mean is known to be the summarization, and that only some remarkable scores assign to the summarized performance a value equal to a weighted arithmetic mean of the values assigned to the domain-specific performances. These scores include the family of ranking scores, a continuum parameterized by user preferences, and that the weights to consider in the arithmetic mean depend on the user preferences. Based on this, we rigorously define four domains, named easiest, most difficult, preponderant, and bottleneck domains, as functions of user preferences. After establishing the theory in a general setting, regardless of the task, we develop new visual tools for two-class classification."}

While most are deployed in single node setups, CXL.mem is a technology that implements memories that can be attached to multiple nodes simultaneously, enabling shared memory pooling.

Our approach analyzes data access patterns of MPI applications: it analyzes on-node accesses to/from MPI buffers, as well as cross-node MPI traffic to gather a full understanding of the impact of memory performance. We combine this data in an extended performance model to predict which data transfers could benefit from direct CXL.mem implementations as compared to traditional MPI messages. Our model works on a per-MPI call granularity, allowing the identification and later optimizations of those MPI invocations in the code with the highest potential for speedup by using CXL.mem.\n  For our toolchain, we extend the memory trace sampling tool Mitos and use it to extract data access behavior. In the post-processing step, the raw data is automatically analyzed to provide performance models for each individual MPI call. We validate the models on two sample applications -- a 2D heat transfer miniapp and the HPCG benchmark -- and use them to demonstrate their support for targeted optimizations by integrating CXL.mem."}

Recent work on adaptive parallel reasoning aims to improve inference efficiency by decomposing the problem-solving process into concurrent reasoning threads when beneficial. However, existing methods on realistic tasks are either limited to supervised behavior cloning or exhibit significant accuracy drops compared to widely-used sequential long chain-of-thought (CoT) baselines. Moreover, many require customized inference engines, complicating deployment. We introduce ThreadWeaver, a framework for adaptive parallel reasoning that achieves accuracy on par with popular sequential reasoning models of comparable size while significantly reducing inference latency. ThreadWeaver's performance stems from three key innovations: 1) a two-stage parallel trajectory generator that produces large-scale, high-quality CoT data with parallel annotations for supervised fine-tuning; 2) a trie-based training-inference co-design that enables parallel reasoning on any off-the-shelf autoregressive inference engine without modifying position embeddings or KV caches; and 3) a parallelization-aware reinforcement learning framework that teaches the model to balance accuracy with effective parallelization. Across six challenging mathematical reasoning benchmarks, ThreadWeaver trained atop Qwen3-8B achieves accuracy comparable to cutting-edge sequential reasoning models (71.9% on average and 79.9% on AIME24) while delivering up to 1.53x average speedup in token latency, establishing a new Pareto frontier between accuracy and efficiency."}

However, despite empirical success, a principled understanding of how much gradient delay needs to be introduced at each layer to achieve desired level of pipelining was not addressed. This paper, LayerPipe2, fills that gap by formally deriving LayerPipe using variable delayed gradient adaptation and retiming. We identify where delays may be legally inserted and show that the required amount of delay follows directly from the network structure where inner layers require fewer delays and outer layers require longer delays. When pipelining is applied at every layer, the amount of delay depends only on the number of remaining downstream stages. When layers are pipelined in groups, all layers in the group share the same assignment of delays. These insights not only explain previously observed scheduling patterns but also expose an often overlooked challenge that pipelining implicitly requires storage of historical weights. We overcome this storage bottleneck by developing a pipeline--aware moving average that reconstructs the required past states rather than storing them explicitly. This reduces memory cost without sacrificing the accuracy guarantees that makes pipelined learning viable. The result is a principled framework that illustrates how to construct LayerPipe architectures, predicts their delay requirements, and mitigates their storage burden, thereby enabling scalable pipelined training with controlled communication computation tradeoffs."}

The architecture of CFS is methodically segmented into three integral components: Firstly, the DataCapsule server, tasked with the storage, dissemination, and replication of DataCapsules on the edge. Secondly, the middleware, a crucial element running in a Trusted Execution Environment responsible for the enforcement and management of write permissions and requests. Finally, the client component, which manifests as a POSIX-compliant filesystem, is adaptable and operational across many architectures. Experimental evaluations of CFS reveal that, while its read and write performances are comparatively modest, it upholds a high degree of functional correctness.

Current efforts predominantly seek to recover the ETF geometry by imposing constraints on features or classifier weights, yet overlook a critical problem: There is a pronounced misalignment between the feature and the classifier weight spaces. In this paper, we theoretically quantify the harm of such misalignment through an optimal error exponent analysis. Built on this insight, we propose three explicit alignment strategies that plug-and-play into existing long-tail methods without architectural change. Extensive experiments on the CIFAR-10-LT, CIFAR-100-LT, and ImageNet-LT datasets consistently boost examined baselines and achieve the state-of-the-art performances."}

Building on this framework, Uchino, Ozaki, and Imamura developed high-performance and power-efficient techniques for emulating single- and double-precision real matrix multiplication on INT8 matrix engines. Extending this line of research, the present study proposes high-performance emulation methods for single- and double-precision complex matrix multiplication on INT8 matrix engines, based on the Ozaki-II scheme. On an NVIDIA B200 GPU, the proposed methods achieve 4.0x--5.6x and 4.4x--6.5x speedups over the native single- and double-precision complex matrix multiplication routines from cuBLAS, respectively, for sufficiently large problem sizes. When lower accuracy than that of the standard routine is acceptable, the proposed methods can operate at even higher speed. Conversely, with only a modest increase in computation time, they can also deliver higher accuracy than the standard routines.

However, previous studies focus only on unimodal architectures and fail to generalize to multimodal models, even though the multimodal models are a common choice in agentic AI systems. To address this limitation, we propose a framework that predicts the peak GPU memory usage by analyzing the model architecture and training behavior of multimodal models.

However, implementations for access by programmable alternatives known as lightweight threads (also referred to as asynchronous calls or coroutines) have not been thoroughly studied. The main advantage of lightweight threads is their significantly lower overhead during launch and context switching. However, this comes at a cost: to achieve proper parallelism, context switches must be manually invoked in the code; without these switches, new lightweight threads will never be executed.\n  In this paper, we focus on the simplest multithreaded data structure: a mutex (also known as a lock). We demonstrate that original implementations for OS threads cannot be used effectively in this new context due to the potential for deadlocks. Furthermore, correctness is not the only concern. In certain languages, such as C++, there are various lightweight thread libraries, each with different implementations and interfaces, which necessitate distinct lock implementations.\n  In this work, we present a modification of TTAS and MCS locks for the use from lightweight threads and demonstrate that the two context switch mechanisms of lightweight threads, yielding and sleeping, are crucial. However, the performance of TTAS and MCS may differ significantly depending on the settings. If one wants to have a lock that works well for any library, we suggest using the cohort lock, which strikes a balance between MCS and TTAS by utilizing several MCS queues with a common TTAS."}

HSTMixer employs a hierarchical spatiotemporal mixing block to extract multi-resolution features through bottom-up aggregation and top-down propagation. Furthermore, an adaptive region mixer generates transformation matrices based on regional semantics, enabling our model to dynamically capture evolving spatiotemporal patterns for different regions.

Specifically, if the model of the system can be interpreted as a finite-state automaton, we can generate an exhaustive test suite for the implementation that covers all possible states and transitions.\n  In this paper, we discuss how to efficiently generate such a test suite for distributed systems written in the actor model. Importantly, our approach does not require any modifications to the code or interfering with the distributed system execution environment. As an example, we verified an implementation of a replication algorithm based on Viewstamped Replication, which is used in a real-world system."}

However, as the input sequence varies, the computational bottlenecks in Transformer models exhibit dynamic behavior across stages, which calls for a cross-stage sparse acceleration strategy.

To this end, this paper proposes a log-domain attention prediction algorithm-architecture co-design, named LAPA. First, an asymmetric leading one computing (ALOC) scheme is designed to eliminate expensive multiplications.

However, existing methods are typically structured around scoring individual points or simple pairs. Such {point- or pair-centric} view not only overlooks the contextual nature of anomalies, which are defined by their deviation from a collective group, but also fails to exploit the rich supervisory signals that can be generated from the combinatorial composition of sets. Consequently, such models struggle to exploit the high-order interactions within the data, which are critical for learning discriminative representations. To address these limitations, we propose SetAD, a novel framework that reframes semi-supervised AD as a Set-level Anomaly Detection task. SetAD employs an attention-based set encoder trained via a graded learning objective, where the model learns to quantify the degree of anomalousness within an entire set. This approach directly models the complex group-level interactions that define anomalies. Furthermore, to enhance robustness and score calibration, we propose a context-calibrated anomaly scoring mechanism, which assesses a point's anomaly score by aggregating its normalized deviations from peer behavior across multiple, diverse contextual sets. Extensive experiments on 10 real-world datasets demonstrate that SetAD significantly outperforms state-of-the-art models. Notably, we show that our model's performance consistently improves with increasing set size, providing strong empirical support for the set-based formulation of anomaly detection."}

Our methodology, applied to 100,000 trade records, combines several ML techniques. Unsupervised Clustering (K-Means) discovers natural trade archetypes based on shipment value and weight. Anomaly Detection (Isolation Forest and IQR) identifies rare \"mega-trades\" and shipments with commercially unusual price-per-kilogram values. This is supplemented by Heuristic Flagging to find tactics like vague shipment descriptions. These layers are combined into a priority score, which successfully identified 1,351 price outliers and 1,288 high-priority shipments for customs review. A key finding is that high-priority commodities show a different and more valuable value-to-weight ratio than general goods. This was validated using Explainable AI (SHAP), which confirmed vague descriptions and high value as the most significant risk predictors. The model's sensitivity was validated by its detection of a massive spike in \"mega-trades\" in early 2021, correlating directly with the real-world regulatory impact of the US AIM Act.

These life trajectories combine demographic information with annual changes in residence, work, education, income, and family circumstances, allowing us to assess how effectively such sequences support longitudinal prediction. We compare multiple NLP architectures (including LSTM, DistilBERT, BERT, and Qwen) and find that sequential and transformer-based models capture temporal and semantic structure more effectively than baseline models. The results show that textualized register data preserves meaningful information about individual pathways and supports complex, scalable modeling. Because few countries maintain longitudinal microdata with comparable coverage and precision, this dataset enables analyses and methodological tests that would be difficult or impossible elsewhere, offering a rigorous testbed for developing and evaluating new sequence-modeling approaches. Overall, our findings demonstrate that combining semantically rich register data with modern language models can substantially advance longitudinal analysis in social sciences."}

In many scientific and engineering settings the response is functional, varying smoothly over an index such as time or wavelength, which makes classical formulations inadequate. Existing methods often minimize integrated error, which captures average performance but neglects worst case deviations. To address this limitation we propose min-max Functional Bayesian Optimization (MM-FBO), a framework that directly minimizes the maximum error across the functional domain. Functional responses are represented using functional principal component analysis, and Gaussian process surrogates are constructed for the principal component scores. Building on this representation, MM-FBO introduces an integrated uncertainty acquisition function that balances exploitation of worst case expected error with exploration across the functional domain. We provide two theoretical guarantees: a discretization bound for the worst case objective, and a consistency result showing that as the surrogate becomes accurate and uncertainty vanishes, the acquisition converges to the true min-max objective. We validate the method through experiments on synthetic benchmarks and physics inspired case studies involving electromagnetic scattering by metaphotonic devices and vapor phase infiltration. Results show that MM-FBO consistently outperforms existing baselines and highlights the importance of explicitly modeling functional uncertainty in Bayesian optimization."}

Hence, we propose a novel Mixture of Experts (MoE)-based noise estimator within a score-based diffusion framework. Specifically, the Receptive Field Adaptive MoE (RFAMoE) module is designed to enable each channel to adap- tively select desired receptive fields throughout the diffusion process. Moreover, recent literature has found that when generating a physiological signal, performing multiple inferences and averaging the reconstructed signals can effectively reduce reconstruction errors, but at the cost of significant computational and latency over- head. We design a Fusion MoE module and innovatively leverage the nature of MoE module to generate K noise signals in parallel, fuse them using a routing mechanism, and complete signal reconstruction in a single inference step. This design not only improves performance over previous methods but also eliminates the substantial computational cost and latency associated with multiple inference processes.

CRAG constructs a structured latent space that disentangles normal and risk-related behaviors, enabling efficient use of limited crash data.

Existing algorithms, however, are typically derived from optimization viewpoints and do not explicitly exploit the conic geometry induced by NMF: data points lie in a convex cone whose extreme rays encode fundamental directions or \"topics\". In this work we revisit NMF from this geometric perspective and propose Cone Collapse, an algorithm that starts from the full nonnegative orthant and iteratively shrinks it toward the minimal cone generated by the data. We prove that, under mild assumptions on the data, Cone Collapse terminates in finitely many steps and recovers the minimal generating cone of $\\mathbf{X}^\\top$ . Building on this basis, we then derive a cone-aware orthogonal NMF model (CC-NMF) by applying uni-orthogonal NMF to the recovered extreme rays. Across 16 benchmark gene-expression, text, and image datasets, CC-NMF consistently matches or outperforms strong NMF baselines-including multiplicative updates, ANLS, projective NMF, ONMF, and sparse NMF-in terms of clustering purity.

Generalized Spatial Propagation Network (GSPN) addresses this by replacing quadratic self-attention with a line-scan propagation scheme, bringing the cost close to linear in the number of rows or columns, while retaining accuracy. Despite this advancement, the existing GSPN implementation still suffers from (i) heavy overhead due to repeatedly launching GPU kernels, (ii) excessive data transfers from global GPU memory, and (iii) redundant computations caused by maintaining separate propagation weights for each channel. We introduce GSPN-2, a joint algorithm-system redesign. In particular, we eliminate thousands of micro-launches from the previous implementation into one single 2D kernel, explicitly pin one warp to each channel slice, and stage the previous column's activations in shared memory. On the model side, we introduce a compact channel propagation strategy that replaces per-channel matrices, trimming parameters, and align naturally with the affinity map used in transformer attention. Experiments demonstrate GSPN-2's effectiveness across image classification and text-to-image synthesis tasks, matching transformer-level accuracy with significantly lower computational cost. GSPN-2 establishes a new efficiency frontier for modeling global spatial context in vision applications through its unique combination of structured matrix transformations and GPU-optimized implementation.

To that end we introduce Brush, an SR algorithm that combines decision-tree-like splitting algorithms with non-linear constant optimization, allowing for seamless integration of rule-based logic into symbolic regression and classification models. Brush achieves Pareto-optimal performance on SRBench, and was applied to recapitulate two widely used clinical scoring systems, achieving high accuracy and interpretable models.

In particular, self-explainable models are useful because they generate explanations during prediction, which can help preserve knowledge. However, most existing explainable approaches use post-hoc explanations or require additional memory for each new task, resulting in limited scalability. In this work, we introduce CIP-Net, an exemplar-free self-explainable prototype-based model designed for continual learning.

Single-objective Reinforcement Learning approaches typically address this by optimizing a fixed scalarized reward function, resulting in rigid policies that fail to adapt to varying clinical priorities. Multi-objective Reinforcement Learning (MORL) offers a solution by learning a set of optimal policies along the Pareto Frontier, allowing for dynamic preference selection at test time. However, applying MORL in healthcare necessitates strict offline learning from historical data.\n  In this paper, we benchmark three offline MORL algorithms, Conditioned Conservative Pareto Q-Learning (CPQL), Adaptive CPQL, and a modified Pareto Efficient Decision Agent (PEDA) Decision Transformer (PEDA DT), against three scalarized single-objective baselines (BC, CQL, and DDQN) on the MIMIC-IV dataset. Using Off-Policy Evaluation (OPE) metrics, we demonstrate that PEDA DT algorithm offers superior flexibility compared to static scalarized baselines. Notably, our results extend previous findings on single-objective Decision Transformers in healthcare, confirming that sequence modeling architectures remain robust and effective when scaled to multi-objective conditioned generation. These findings suggest that offline MORL is a promising framework for enabling personalized, adjustable decision-making in critical care without the need for retraining."}

Furthermore, in medical domain, models like MeWM typically ignore patient-specific temporal and clinical contexts and lack a feedback mechanism to link predictions to treatment decisions. To address these gaps, we introduce CLARITY, a medical world model that forecasts disease evolution directly within a structured latent space. It explicitly integrates time intervals (temporal context) and patient-specific data (clinical context) to model treatment-conditioned progression as a smooth, interpretable trajectory, and thus generate physiologically faithful, individualized treatment plans.

This reliance on static, data-agnostic kernels creates a fundamental trade-off, forcing practitioners to sacrifice significant model accuracy for computational efficiency. We introduce \\textsc{LUNA}, a kernelized linear attention mechanism that eliminates this trade-off, retaining linear cost while matching and surpassing the accuracy of quadratic attention. \\textsc{LUNA} is built on the key insight that the kernel feature map itself should be learned rather than fixed a priori. By parameterizing the kernel, \\textsc{LUNA} learns a feature basis tailored to the specific data and task, overcoming the expressive limitations of fixed-feature methods. \\textsc{Luna} implements this with a learnable feature map that induces a positive-definite kernel and admits a streaming form, yielding linear time and memory scaling in the sequence length. Empirical evaluations validate our approach across diverse settings. On the Long Range Arena (LRA), \\textsc{Luna} achieves state-of-the-art average accuracy among efficient Transformers under compute parity, using the same parameter count, training steps, and approximate FLOPs. \\textsc{Luna} also excels at post-hoc conversion: replacing softmax in fine-tuned BERT and ViT-B/16 checkpoints and briefly fine-tuning recovers most of the original performance, substantially outperforming fixed linearizations."}

However, the wide variation in crisis types makes achieving generalizable performance across unseen disasters a persistent challenge. Existing approaches primarily leverage deep learning to fuse textual and visual cues for crisis classification, achieving numerically plausible results under in-domain settings. However, they exhibit poor generalization across unseen crisis types because they 1. do not disentangle spurious and causal features, resulting in performance degradation under domain shift, and 2. fail to align heterogeneous modality representations within a shared space, which hinders the direct adaptation of established single-modality domain generalization (DG) techniques to the multimodal setting. To address these issues, we introduce a causality-guided multimodal domain generalization (MMDG) framework that combines adversarial disentanglement with unified representation learning for crisis classification. The adversarial objective encourages the model to disentangle and focus on domain-invariant causal features, leading to more generalizable classifications grounded in stable causal mechanisms. The unified representation aligns features from different modalities within a shared latent space, enabling single-modality DG strategies to be seamlessly extended to multimodal learning. Experiments on the different datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves the best performance in unseen disaster scenarios."}

However, how these models internally represent chemical knowledge remains poorly understood. In this work, we extend sparse autoencoder techniques to uncover and examine interpretable features within CLMs. Applying our methodology to the Foundation Models for Materials (FM4M) SMI-TED chemistry foundation model, we extract semantically meaningful latent features and analyse their activation patterns across diverse molecular datasets. Our findings reveal that these models encode a rich landscape of chemical concepts. We identify correlations between specific latent features and distinct domains of chemical knowledge, including structural motifs, physicochemical properties, and pharmacological drug classes.

Such dishonesty may arise due to the effects of reinforcement learning (RL), where challenges with reward shaping can result in a training process that inadvertently incentivizes the model to lie or misrepresent its actions.\n  In this work we propose a method for eliciting an honest expression of an LLM's shortcomings via a self-reported *confession*. A confession is an output, provided upon request after a model's original answer, that is meant to serve as a full account of the model's compliance with the letter and spirit of its policies and instructions. The reward assigned to a confession during training is solely based on its honesty, and does not impact positively or negatively the main answer's reward. As long as the \"path of least resistance\" for maximizing confession reward is to surface misbehavior rather than covering it up, this incentivizes models to be honest in their confessions. Our findings provide some justification this empirical assumption, especially in the case of egregious model misbehavior.\n  To demonstrate the viability of our approach, we train GPT-5-Thinking to produce confessions, and we evaluate its honesty in out-of-distribution scenarios measuring hallucination, instruction following, scheming, and reward hacking. We find that when the model lies or omits shortcomings in its \"main\" answer, it often confesses to these behaviors honestly, and this confession honesty modestly improves with training. Confessions can enable a number of inference-time interventions including monitoring, rejection sampling, and surfacing issues to the user."}

Common metrics used for this choice, such as Accuracy, Precision, and F1, are sensitive to class imbalance and to arbitrary choices of positive class, and can favor judges that distort prevalence estimates.

However, these approaches may fail: (1) when some (non-target) classes are easily discriminable from all others, in which case they may naturally achieve extreme detection statistics (e.g., decision confidence); and (2) when the backdoor is subtle, i.e., with its features weak relative to intrinsic class-discriminative features. A key observation is that the backdoor target class has contributions to its detection statistic from both the backdoor trigger and from its intrinsic features, whereas non-target classes only have contributions from their intrinsic features. To achieve more sensitive detectors, we thus propose to suppress intrinsic features while optimizing the detection statistic for a given class. For non-target classes, such suppression will drastically reduce the achievable statistic, whereas for the target class the (significant) contribution from the backdoor trigger remains. In practice, we formulate a constrained optimization problem, leveraging a small set of clean examples from a given class, and optimizing the detection statistic while orthogonalizing with respect to the class's intrinsic features. We dub this plug-and-play approach Class Subspace Orthogonalization (CSO) and assess it against challenging mixed-label and adaptive attacks."}

This paper describes the first component of a novel Biothreat Benchmark Generation (BBG) Framework. The BBG approach is designed to help model developers and evaluators reliably measure and assess the biosecurity risk uplift and general harm potential of existing and future AI models, while accounting for key aspects of the threat itself that are often overlooked in other benchmarking efforts, including different actor capability levels, and operational (in addition to purely technical) risk factors.

The BBG is built upon a hierarchical structure of biothreat categories, elements and tasks, which then serves as the basis for the development of task-aligned queries. This paper outlines the development of this biothreat task-query architecture, which we have named the Bacterial Biothreat Schema, while future papers will describe follow-on efforts to turn queries into model prompts, as well as how the resulting benchmarks can be implemented for model evaluation. Overall, the BBG Framework, including the Bacterial Biothreat Schema, seeks to offer a robust, re-usable structure for evaluating bacterial biological risks arising from LLMs across multiple levels of aggregation, which captures the full scope of technical and operational requirements for biological adversaries, and which accounts for a wide spectrum of biological adversary capabilities."}

In this thesis, we harness methodologies from open-endedness and multi-agent learning to train and evaluate robust AI agents capable of generalising to novel environments, out-of-distribution inputs, and interactions with other co-player agents. We begin by introducing MiniHack, a sandbox framework for creating diverse environments through procedural content generation. Based on the game of NetHack, MiniHack enables the construction of new tasks for reinforcement learning (RL) agents with a focus on generalisation. We then present Maestro, a novel approach for generating adversarial curricula that progressively enhance the robustness and generality of RL agents in two-player zero-sum games. We further probe robustness in multi-agent domains, utilising quality-diversity methods to systematically identify vulnerabilities in state-of-the-art, pre-trained RL policies within the complex video game football domain, characterised by intertwined cooperative and competitive dynamics. Finally, we extend our exploration of robustness to the domain of LLMs. Here, our focus is on diagnosing and enhancing the robustness of LLMs against adversarial prompts, employing evolutionary search to generate a diverse range of effective inputs that aim to elicit undesirable outputs from an LLM.

Yet, existing language identification tools struggle with key cases -- such as music requests where the song title and user language differ. Open-source tools like LangDetect, FastText are fast but less accurate, while large language models, though effective, are often too costly for low-latency or low-resource settings. We introduce PolyLingua, a lightweight Transformer-based model for in-domain language detection and fine-grained language classification. It employs a two-level contrastive learning framework combining instance-level separation and class-level alignment with adaptive margins, yielding compact and well-separated embeddings even for closely related languages. Evaluated on two challenging datasets -- Amazon Massive (multilingual digital assistant utterances) and a Song dataset (music requests with frequent code-switching) -- PolyLingua achieves 99.25% F1 and 98.15% F1, respectively, surpassing Sonnet 3.5 while using 10x fewer parameters, making it ideal for compute- and latency-constrained environments."}

From shared initial noise samples, TreeGRPO strategically branches to generate multiple candidate trajectories while efficiently reusing their common prefixes. This tree-structured approach delivers three key advantages: (1) \\emph{High sample efficiency}, achieving better performance under same training samples (2) \\emph{Fine-grained credit assignment} via reward backpropagation that computes step-specific advantages, overcoming the uniform credit assignment limitation of trajectory-based methods, and (3) \\emph{Amortized computation} where multi-child branching enables multiple policy updates per forward pass.

However, despite empirical success, a principled understanding of how much gradient delay needs to be introduced at each layer to achieve desired level of pipelining was not addressed. This paper, LayerPipe2, fills that gap by formally deriving LayerPipe using variable delayed gradient adaptation and retiming. We identify where delays may be legally inserted and show that the required amount of delay follows directly from the network structure where inner layers require fewer delays and outer layers require longer delays. When pipelining is applied at every layer, the amount of delay depends only on the number of remaining downstream stages. When layers are pipelined in groups, all layers in the group share the same assignment of delays. These insights not only explain previously observed scheduling patterns but also expose an often overlooked challenge that pipelining implicitly requires storage of historical weights. We overcome this storage bottleneck by developing a pipeline--aware moving average that reconstructs the required past states rather than storing them explicitly. This reduces memory cost without sacrificing the accuracy guarantees that makes pipelined learning viable. The result is a principled framework that illustrates how to construct LayerPipe architectures, predicts their delay requirements, and mitigates their storage burden, thereby enabling scalable pipelined training with controlled communication computation tradeoffs."}

Traditional physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have demonstrated substantial potential in solving differential equations, and their quantum counterparts, quantum-PINNs, exhibit enhanced representational capacity with fewer trainable parameters. However, both approaches face notable challenges in accurately solving multiscale features. Furthermore, their reliance on automatic differentiation for constructing loss functions introduces considerable computational overhead, resulting in longer training times. To overcome these challenges, we developed a wavelet-accelerated physics-informed quantum neural network that eliminates the need for automatic differentiation, significantly reducing computational complexity. The proposed framework incorporates the multiresolution property of wavelets within the quantum neural network architecture, thereby enhancing the network's ability to effectively capture both local and global features of multiscale problems.

A common approach to leverage this data is to train a graph neural network (GNN) on the KG. However, existing message-passing GNNs struggle to scale to large KGs because they rely on the iterative message passing process to learn the graph structure, which is inefficient, especially under mini-batch training, where a node sees only a partial view of its neighborhood. In this paper, we address this problem and present gHAWK, a novel and scalable GNN training framework for large KGs. The key idea is to precompute structural features for each node that capture its local and global structure before GNN training even begins. Specifically, gHAWK introduces a preprocessing step that computes: (a)~Bloom filters to compactly encode local neighborhood structure, and (b)~TransE embeddings to represent each node's global position in the graph. These features are then fused with any domain-specific features (e.g., text embeddings), producing a node feature vector that can be incorporated into any GNN technique. By augmenting message-passing training with structural priors, gHAWK significantly reduces memory usage, accelerates convergence, and improves model accuracy. Extensive experiments on large datasets from the Open Graph Benchmark (OGB) demonstrate that gHAWK achieves state-of-the-art accuracy and lower training time on both node property prediction and link prediction tasks, topping the OGB leaderboard for three graphs."}

Oblique forests address this with per-node hyperplane splits, but at added computational cost and implementation complexity. We propose a simple alternative: JARF, Jacobian-Aligned Random Forests. Concretely, we first fit an axis-aligned forest to estimate class probabilities or regression outputs, compute finite-difference gradients of these predictions with respect to each feature, aggregate them into an expected Jacobian outer product that generalizes the expected gradient outer product (EGOP), and use it as a single global linear preconditioner for all inputs. This supervised preconditioner applies a single global rotation of the feature space, then hands the transformed data back to a standard axis-aligned forest, preserving off-the-shelf training pipelines while capturing oblique boundaries and feature interactions that would otherwise require many axis-aligned splits to approximate. The same construction applies to any model that provides gradients, though we focus on random forests and gradient-boosted trees in this work. On tabular classification and regression benchmarks, this preconditioning consistently improves axis-aligned forests and often matches or surpasses oblique baselines while improving training time. Our experimental results and theoretical analysis together indicate that supervised preconditioning can recover much of the accuracy of oblique forests while retaining the simplicity and robustness of axis-aligned trees."}

It has been observed in recent works that learning in a federated manner may lead the aggregated global model to converge to a 'sharp minimum' thereby adversely affecting the generalizability of this FL-trained model. Therefore, in this work, we aim to improve the generalization performance of models trained in a federated setup by introducing a 'flatness' constrained FL optimization problem. This flatness constraint is imposed on the top eigenvalue of the Hessian computed from the training loss. As each client trains a model on its local data, we further re-formulate this complex problem utilizing the client loss functions and propose a new computationally efficient regularization technique, dubbed 'MAN,' which Minimizes Activation's Norm of each layer on client-side models. We also theoretically show that minimizing the activation norm reduces the top eigenvalue of the layer-wise Hessian of the client's loss, which in turn decreases the overall Hessian's top eigenvalue, ensuring convergence to a flat minimum. We apply our proposed flatness-constrained optimization to the existing FL techniques and obtain significant improvements, thereby establishing new state-of-the-art."}

Existing attack strategies typically rely on locally uniform perturbations, which treat all samples indiscriminately. This approach is inefficient, as it wastes the perturbation budget on low-impact samples, and lacks stealthiness due to significant statistical deviations. In this paper, we propose a novel Global Budget Allocation attack strategy. Leveraging the theoretical insight that a sample's influence on value function convergence is proportional to its Temporal Difference (TD) error, we formulate the attack as a global resource allocation problem. We derive a closed-form solution where perturbation magnitudes are assigned proportional to the TD-error sensitivity under a global L2 constraint. Empirical results on D4RL benchmarks demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms baseline strategies, achieving up to 80% performance degradation with minimal perturbations that evade detection by state-of-the-art statistical and spectral defenses."}

We apply spectral normalization to the hidden layers so the network preserves distances from input to latent space. PG-SNGP replaces the final dense layer with a Gaussian Process layer for distance-sensitive uncertainty, while PG-SNER outputs Normal Inverse Gamma parameters to model uncertainty in a coherent probabilistic form. We assess performance using standard accuracy metrics and a new distance-aware metric based on the Pearson Correlation Coefficient, which measures how well predicted uncertainty tracks the distance between test and training samples. We also design a dynamic weighting scheme in the loss to balance data fidelity and physical consistency. We test our methods on rolling-element bearing degradation using the PRONOSTIA dataset and compare them with Monte Carlo and Deep Ensemble PGNNs.

Traditional models rely mainly on historical prices, but recent work shows that financial news can provide useful external signals. This paper investigates a multimodal approach that integrates companies' news articles with their historical stock data to improve prediction performance. We compare a Graph Neural Network (GNN) model with a baseline LSTM model. Historical data for each company is encoded using an LSTM, while news titles are embedded with a language model. These embeddings form nodes in a heterogeneous graph, and GraphSAGE is used to capture interactions between articles, companies, and industries. We evaluate two targets: a binary direction-of-change label and a significance-based label. Experiments on the US equities and Bloomberg datasets show that the GNN outperforms the LSTM baseline, achieving 53% accuracy on the first target and a 4% precision gain on the second. Results also indicate that companies with more associated news yield higher prediction accuracy. Moreover, headlines contain stronger predictive signals than full articles, suggesting that concise news summaries play an important role in short-term market reactions."}

Our primary contribution is a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) architecture that leverages an extended sequence length of 9,840 games equivalent to eight full NBA seasons to capture evolving team dynamics and season-over-season dependencies. We compare this model against several traditional Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) baselines, including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The LSTM achieves the best performance across all metrics, with 72.35 accuracy, 73.15 precision and 76.13 AUC-ROC. These results demonstrate the importance of long-sequence temporal modeling in basketball outcome prediction and highlight the value of our new multi-season dataset for developing robust, generalizable NBA forecasting systems."}

Part qualification aims at verifying that an additively manufactured part meets performance requirements; therefore, predicting the complex stress-strain behaviors of additively manufactured parts is critical. We develop a dynamic time warping (DTW)-transfer learning (TL) framework for additive manufacturing part qualification by transferring knowledge of the stress-strain behaviors of additively manufactured low-cost polymers to metals. Specifically, the framework employs DTW to select a polymer dataset as the source domain that is the most relevant to the target metal dataset. Using a long short-term memory (LSTM) model, four source polymers (i.e., Nylon, PLA, CF-ABS, and Resin) and three target metals (i.e., AlSi10Mg, Ti6Al4V, and carbon steel) that are fabricated by different AM techniques are utilized to demonstrate the effectiveness of the DTW-TL framework. Experimental results show that the DTW-TL framework identifies the closest match between polymers and metals to select one single polymer dataset as the source domain. The DTW-TL model achieves the lowest mean absolute percentage error of 12.41% and highest coefficient of determination of 0.96 when three metals are used as the target domain, respectively, outperforming the vanilla LSTM model without TL as well as the TL model pre-trained on four polymer datasets as the source domain."}

Beside the curation cost, this also risks overlooking unanticipated, less obvious prompts that trigger biased generation, even in models that have undergone debiasing. In this work, we introduce Bias-Guided Prompt Search (BGPS), a framework that automatically generates prompts that aim to maximize the presence of biases in the resulting images. BGPS comprises two components: (1) an LLM instructed to produce attribute-neutral prompts and (2) attribute classifiers acting on the TTI's internal representations that steer the decoding process of the LLM toward regions of the prompt space that amplify the image attributes of interest. We conduct extensive experiments on Stable Diffusion 1.5 and a state-of-the-art debiased model and discover an array of subtle and previously undocumented biases that severely deteriorate fairness metrics. Crucially, the discovered prompts are interpretable, i.e they may be entered by a typical user, quantitatively improving the perplexity metric compared to a prominent hard prompt optimization counterpart. Our findings uncover TTI vulnerabilities, while BGPS expands the bias search space and can act as a new evaluation tool for bias mitigation."}

To address this challenge, we introduce Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (NODEs) as a dynamic framework for learning the complex interplay between the proteome and metabolome. We applied this framework to time-series data derived from engineered Escherichia coli strains, modeling the continuous dynamics of metabolic pathways. The proposed NODE architecture demonstrates superior performance in capturing system dynamics compared to traditional machine learning pipelines. Our results show a greater than 90% improvement in root mean squared error over baselines across both Limonene (up to 94.38% improvement) and Isopentenol (up to 97.65% improvement) pathway datasets.

In contrast, another promising line of research has investigated universal graph prompt tuning, which operates directly in the input graph's feature space and builds a theoretical foundation that universal graph prompt tuning can theoretically achieve an equivalent effect of any prompting function, eliminating dependence on specific pre-training strategies. Recent works propose selective node-based graph prompt tuning to pursue more ideal prompts. However, we argue that selective node-based graph prompt tuning inevitably compromises the theoretical foundation of universal graph prompt tuning. In this paper, we strengthen the theoretical foundation of universal graph prompt tuning by introducing stricter constraints, demonstrating that adding prompts to all nodes is a necessary condition for achieving the universality of graph prompts. To this end, we propose a novel model and paradigm, Learning and Editing Universal GrAph Prompt Tuning (LEAP), which preserves the theoretical foundation of universal graph prompt tuning while pursuing more ideal prompts. Specifically, we first build the basic universal graph prompts to preserve the theoretical foundation and then employ actor-critic reinforcement learning to select nodes and edit prompts. Extensive experiments on graph- and node-level tasks across various pre-training strategies in both full-shot and few-shot scenarios show that LEAP consistently outperforms fine-tuning and other prompt-based approaches."}

This enables TabPFN to perform direct node classification without any graph-specific training or language model dependencies. Our experiments on 12 benchmark datasets reveal that TabPFN-GN achieves competitive performance with GNNs on homophilous graphs and consistently outperforms them on heterophilous graphs.

However, the two approaches are synergistic: uplift models can be leveraged for counterfactual estimation. We propose a counterfactual estimator that fits a bivariate beta distribution to predicted uplift scores, yielding posterior distributions over counterfactual outcomes. Our approach requires no causal assumptions beyond those of uplift modeling. Simulations show the efficacy of the approach, which can be applied, for example, to the problem of customer churn in telecom, where it reveals insights unavailable to standard ML or uplift models alone."}

Using the ERA5 dataset and FourCastNet (Pathak et al. 2022), we demonstrate WAAPO's ability to generate adversarial trajectories that align closely with predefined targets, even under constrained conditions. Our experiments highlight critical vulnerabilities in AI-driven forecasting models, where small perturbations to initial conditions can result in significant deviations in predicted weather patterns.

We illustrate this point, both in simple two-state and three-state systems in which TD($λ$)--starting from an optimal policy--converges to a sub-optimal policy, and also in backgammon. We then present a modified form of TD($λ$), called STD($λ$), in which function approximators are trained with respect to relative state values on binary decision problems.

L_acc enforces consistency in the discrete second-order temporal differences of the generated motion, thereby aligning the diffusion prior with IMU-specific acceleration patterns. We integrate L_acc into the training objective of an existing diffusion model, finetune the model to obtain an IMU-specific motion prior, and evaluate the model with an existing text-to-IMU framework that comprises surface modelling and virtual sensor simulation. We analysed acceleration signal fidelity and differences between synthetic motion representation and actual IMU recordings. As a downstream application, we evaluated Human Activity Recognition (HAR) and compared the classification performance using data of our method with the earlier diffusion model and two additional diffusion model baselines. When we augmented the earlier diffusion model objective with L_acc and continued training, L_acc decreased by 12.7% relative to the original model. The improvements were considerably larger in high-dynamic activities (i.e., running, jumping) compared to low-dynamic activities~(i.e., sitting, standing). In a low-dimensional embedding, the synthetic IMU data produced by our refined model shifts closer to the distribution of real IMU recordings. HAR classification trained exclusively on our refined synthetic IMU data improved performance by 8.7% compared to the earlier diffusion model and by 7.6% over the best-performing comparison diffusion model.

Regulations such as GDPR and HIPAA impose strict controls on data handling, making it difficult to balance the need for insights with privacy requirements. Synthetic data offers a promising solution by creating artificial datasets that reflect real patterns without exposing sensitive information. However, traditional synthetic data methods often fail to capture complex, implicit rules that link different elements of the data and are essential in domains like healthcare. They may reproduce explicit patterns but overlook domain-specific constraints that are not directly stated yet crucial for realism and utility. For example, prescription guidelines that restrict certain medications for specific conditions or prevent harmful drug interactions may not appear explicitly in the original data. Synthetic data generated without these implicit rules can lead to medically inappropriate or unrealistic profiles. To address this gap, we propose ContextGAN, a Context-Aware Differentially Private Generative Adversarial Network that integrates domain-specific rules through a constraint matrix encoding both explicit and implicit knowledge. The constraint-aware discriminator evaluates synthetic data against these rules to ensure adherence to domain constraints, while differential privacy protects sensitive details from the original data. We validate ContextGAN across healthcare, security, and finance, showing that it produces high-quality synthetic data that respects domain rules and preserves privacy. Our results demonstrate that ContextGAN improves realism and utility by enforcing domain constraints, making it suitable for applications that require compliance with both explicit patterns and implicit rules under strict privacy guarantees."}

To bridge this gap, we propose Fed-SE, a Federated Self-Evolution framework for LLM agents. Fed-SE establishes a local evolution-global aggregation paradigm. Locally, agents employ parameter-efficient fine-tuning on filtered, high-return trajectories to achieve stable gradient updates. Globally, Fed-SE aggregates updates within a low-rank subspace that disentangles environment-specific dynamics, effectively reducing negative transfer across clients. Experiments across five heterogeneous environments demonstrate that Fed-SE improves average task success rates by approximately 18% over federated baselines, validating its effectiveness in robust cross-environment knowledge transfer in privacy-constrained deployments."}

In this work, we show that popular implementations from both regimes exhibit a tendency to compromise privacy by reproducing memorized patterns of numeric digits from their training data. To systematically analyze this risk, we introduce a simple No-box Membership Inference Attack (MIA) called LevAtt that assumes adversarial access to only the generated synthetic data and targets the string sequences of numeric digits in synthetic observations. Using this approach, our attack exposes substantial privacy leakage across a wide range of models and datasets, and in some cases, is even a perfect membership classifier on state-of-the-art models. Our findings highlight a unique privacy vulnerability of LLM-based synthetic data generation and the need for effective defenses. To this end, we propose two methods, including a novel sampling strategy that strategically perturbs digits during generation. Our evaluation demonstrates that this approach can defeat these attacks with minimal loss of fidelity and utility of the synthetic data."}

Disregarding this phenomenon, commonly referred to as concept drift, can significantly diminish a model's predictive accuracy. Furthermore, the presence of hyperparameters in online models exacerbates this issue. These parameters are typically fixed and cannot be dynamically adjusted by the user in response to the evolving data distribution. Gaussian Process (GP) models offer powerful non-parametric regression capabilities with uncertainty quantification, making them ideal for modeling complex data relationships in an online setting. However, conventional online GP methods face several critical limitations, including a lack of drift-awareness, reliance on fixed hyperparameters, vulnerability to data snooping, absence of a principled decay mechanism, and memory inefficiencies. In response, we propose DAO-GP (Drift-Aware Online Gaussian Process), a novel, fully adaptive, hyperparameter-free, decayed, and sparse non-linear regression model. DAO-GP features a built-in drift detection and adaptation mechanism that dynamically adjusts model behavior based on the severity of drift. Extensive empirical evaluations confirm DAO-GP's robustness across stationary conditions, diverse drift types (abrupt, incremental, gradual), and varied data characteristics. Analyses demonstrate its dynamic adaptation, efficient in-memory and decay-based management, and evolving inducing points.

This paper challenges that view by proposing a direct framework to model the scaling of benchmark performance from the training budget. We find that for a fixed token-to-parameter ratio, a simple power law can accurately describe the scaling behavior of log accuracy on multiple popular downstream tasks. Our results show that the direct approach extrapolates better than the previously proposed two-stage procedure, which is prone to compounding errors. Furthermore, we introduce functional forms that predict accuracy across token-to-parameter ratios and account for inference compute under repeated sampling. We validate our findings on models with up to 17B parameters trained on up to 350B tokens across two dataset mixtures. To support reproducibility and encourage future research, we release the complete set of pretraining losses and downstream evaluation results."}

Khasawneh"], "title": "Unsupervised Learning of Density Estimates with Topological Optimization", "comment": null, "summary": "Kernel density estimation is a key component of a wide variety of algorithms in machine learning, Bayesian inference, stochastic dynamics and signal processing. However, the unsupervised density estimation technique requires tuning a crucial hyperparameter: the kernel bandwidth. The choice of bandwidth is critical as it controls the bias-variance trade-off by over- or under-smoothing the topological features. Topological data analysis provides methods to mathematically quantify topological characteristics, such as connected components, loops, voids et cetera, even in high dimensions where visualization of density estimates is impossible. In this paper, we propose an unsupervised learning approach using a topology-based loss function for the automated and unsupervised selection of the optimal bandwidth and benchmark it against classical techniques -- demonstrating its potential across different dimensions."}

Kaggle Page: https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/neurips-open-polymer-prediction-2025. Website: https://open-polymer-challenge.github.io", "summary": "Machine learning (ML) offers a powerful path toward discovering sustainable polymer materials, but progress has been limited by the lack of large, high-quality, and openly accessible polymer datasets. The Open Polymer Challenge (OPC) addresses this gap by releasing the first community-developed benchmark for polymer informatics, featuring a dataset with 10K polymers and 5 properties: thermal conductivity, radius of gyration, density, fractional free volume, and glass transition temperature. The challenge centers on multi-task polymer property prediction, a core step in virtual screening pipelines for materials discovery. Participants developed models under realistic constraints that include small data, label imbalance, and heterogeneous simulation sources, using techniques such as feature-based augmentation, transfer learning, self-supervised pretraining, and targeted ensemble strategies. The competition also revealed important lessons about data preparation, distribution shifts, and cross-group simulation consistency, informing best practices for future large-scale polymer datasets. The resulting models, analysis, and released data create a new foundation for molecular AI in polymer science and are expected to accelerate the development of sustainable and energy-efficient materials. Along with the competition, we release the test dataset at https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/alexliu99/neurips-open-polymer-prediction-2025-test-data. We also release the data generation pipeline at https://github.com/sobinalosious/ADEPT, which simulates more than 25 properties, including thermal conductivity, radius of gyration, and density."}

While existing optimization efforts focus primarily on hardware energy efficiency, a significant but overlooked source of inefficiency is software energy waste caused by poor software design. This often includes redundant or poorly designed operations that consume more energy without improving performance. These inefficiencies arise in widely used ML frameworks and applications, yet developers often lack the visibility and tools to detect and diagnose them.\n  We propose differential energy debugging, a novel approach that leverages the observation that competing ML systems often implement similar functionality with vastly different energy consumption. Building on this insight, we design and implement Magneton, an energy profiler that compares energy consumption between similar ML systems at the operator level and automatically pinpoints code regions and configuration choices responsible for excessive energy use. Applied to 9 popular ML systems spanning LLM inference, general ML frameworks, and image generation, Magneton detects and diagnoses 16 known cases of software energy inefficiency and further discovers 8 previously unknown cases, 7 of which have been confirmed by developers."}

After performing an evaluation in several domains, it is highly informative to compute a (weighted) mean performance and, as shown in this paper, to scrutinize what happens during this averaging. To achieve this goal, we adopt a probabilistic framework and consider a performance as a probability measure (e.g., a normalized confusion matrix for a classification task). It appears that the corresponding weighted mean is known to be the summarization, and that only some remarkable scores assign to the summarized performance a value equal to a weighted arithmetic mean of the values assigned to the domain-specific performances. These scores include the family of ranking scores, a continuum parameterized by user preferences, and that the weights to consider in the arithmetic mean depend on the user preferences. Based on this, we rigorously define four domains, named easiest, most difficult, preponderant, and bottleneck domains, as functions of user preferences. After establishing the theory in a general setting, regardless of the task, we develop new visual tools for two-class classification."}
