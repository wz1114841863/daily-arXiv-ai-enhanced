We introduce the concepts of\nElement Tokens and Everything Tokens: elemental tokens represent standardized,\nfully collateralized components of an asset (e.g., outputs, rights, or\ncredits), while an everything token represents the entire asset as a fixed\ncombination of those elements. The architecture enables both fine-grained\npartial ownership and integrated whole-asset ownership through a system of\ntwo-way convertibility. We detail the design and mechanics of this system,\nincluding an arbitrage mechanism that keeps the price of the composite token\naligned with the net asset value of its constituents. Through illustrative\nexamples in the energy and industrial sectors, we demonstrate that our approach\nallows previously illiquid, high-value projects to be fractionalized and traded\nakin to stocks or exchange-traded funds (ETFs).

It allows processes to delay the visibility of\nwrites through store buffering. While this supports hardware-level\noptimizations and makes a significant contribution to multiprocessor\nefficiency, it complicates reasoning about correctness, as executions may\nviolate sequential consistency.

In this work, we develop a semantic framework that precisely\ncharacterizes when such synchronization is necessary under TSO.

Our main result is a theorem that proves that the only way to ensure\nthat two events that take place at different sites are temporally ordered is by\nhaving the execution create an occurs-before chain between the events. By\nstudying the role of fences and $RMW$s in creating occurs-before chains, we are\nthen able to capture cases in which these costly synchronization operations are\nunavoidable. Since proper real-time ordering of events is a fundamental aspect\nof consistency conditions such as Linearizability, our analysis provides a\nsound theoretical understanding of essential aspects of the TSO model. In\nparticular, we are able to generalize prior lower bounds for linearizable\nimplementations of shared memory objects.

However, current methods are often computationally\nexpensive and data-intensive, as they require constructing an uncertainty model\nbefore calibration. Moreover, existing approaches typically represent the\nprediction sets with intervals, which limits their ability to capture\ndependencies in multi-dimensional outputs. We address these limitations by\nintroducing zono-conformal prediction, a novel approach inspired by interval\npredictor models and reachset-conformant identification that constructs\nprediction zonotopes with assured coverage. By placing zonotopic uncertainty\nsets directly into the model of the base predictor, zono-conformal predictors\ncan be identified via a single, data-efficient linear program. While we can\napply zono-conformal prediction to arbitrary nonlinear base predictors, we\nfocus on feed-forward neural networks in this work. Aside from regression\ntasks, we also construct optimal zono-conformal predictors in classification\nsettings where the output of an uncertain predictor is a set of possible\nclasses. We provide probabilistic coverage guarantees and present methods for\ndetecting outliers in the identification data.

In such settings, practitioners often desire predictions that not only\nexhibit good overall accuracy, but also remain reliable within each source and\npreserve the differences that matter across sources. For instance, several\nasylum and refugee resettlement programs now use ML-based employment\npredictions to guide where newly arriving families are placed within a host\ncountry, which requires generating informative and differentiated predictions\nfor many and often small source locations. However, this task is made\nchallenging by several common characteristics of the data in these settings:\nthe presence of numerous distinct data sources, distributional shifts between\nthem, and substantial variation in sample sizes across sources. This paper\nintroduces Clustered Transfer Residual Learning (CTRL), a meta-learning method\nthat combines the strengths of cross-domain residual learning and adaptive\npooling/clustering in order to simultaneously improve overall accuracy and\npreserve source-level heterogeneity. We provide theoretical results that\nclarify how our objective navigates the trade-off between data quantity and\ndata quality.

This simplistic assumption prevents models from\naccurately capturing the complex, non-Gaussian landscapes of natural data,\nparticularly in demanding domains like complex biological data, severely\nhindering the fidelity of the model for scientific discovery. The\nphysically-grounded Boltzmann distribution offers a more expressive\nalternative, but it is computationally intractable on classical computers. To\ndate, quantum approaches have been hampered by the insufficient qubit scale and\noperational stability required for the iterative demands of deep learning.\nHere, we bridge this gap by introducing the Quantum Boltzmann\nMachine-Variational Autoencoder (QBM-VAE), a large-scale and long-time stable\nhybrid quantum-classical architecture. Our framework leverages a quantum\nprocessor for efficient sampling from the Boltzmann distribution, enabling its\nuse as a powerful prior within a deep generative model.

To address this, we propose an air quality PM2.5 index prediction\nmodel based on a hybrid CNN-LSTM architecture. The model effectively combines\nConvolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for local spatial feature extraction and\nLong Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for modeling temporal dependencies in\ntime series data. Using a multivariate dataset collected from an industrial\narea in Beijing between 2010 and 2015 -- which includes hourly records of PM2.5\nconcentration, temperature, dew point, pressure, wind direction, wind speed,\nand precipitation -- the model predicts the average PM2.5 concentration over\n6-hour intervals. Experimental results show that the model achieves a root mean\nsquare error (RMSE) of 5.236, outperforming traditional time series models in\nboth accuracy and generalization.

Notably,\nHGD operates in a streamlined implementation process, requiring no data-buffer,\nextra parameters, or prior knowledge, making it applicable to any learning\nmodels utilizing gradient descent for optimization. Theoretical analysis, based\non a few common and mild assumptions, shows that HGD achieves a satisfied\nsub-linear regret bound. The proposed algorithm are compared with the commonly\nused online imbalance learning methods under several imbalanced data stream\nscenarios. Extensive experimental evaluations demonstrate the efficiency and\neffectiveness of HGD in learning imbalanced data streams.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aHGD\u7684\u68af\u5ea6\u4e0b\u964d\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u89e3\u51b3\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u6570\u636e\u6d41\u5b66\u4e60\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5747\u8861\u4e0d\u540c\u7c7b\u522b\u7684\u68af\u5ea6\u8303\u6570\u5b9e\u73b0\u5e73\u8861\u5b66\u4e60\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u6570\u636e\u6d41\u5e38\u5b58\u5728\u7c7b\u522b\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5982\u91cd\u91c7\u6837\u6216\u91cd\u52a0\u6743\u6548\u679c\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u9700\u6539\u8fdb\u8bad\u7ec3\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faHGD\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5747\u8861\u68af\u5ea6\u8303\u6570\u89e3\u51b3\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u989d\u5916\u53c2\u6570\u6216\u6570\u636e\u7f13\u51b2\u3002", "result": "\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u548c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660eHGD\u5177\u6709\u6b21\u7ebf\u6027\u9057\u61be\u754c\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u6570\u636e\u6d41\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u3002", "conclusion": "HGD\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u901a\u7528\u7684\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u6570\u636e\u6d41\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u4efb\u4f55\u57fa\u4e8e\u68af\u5ea6\u4e0b\u964d\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u3002"}}

Gradient-based DFL requires computing\nthe derivative of the solution to the optimization problem with respect to the\npredicted parameters. However, for many optimization problems, such as linear\nprograms (LPs), the gradient of the regret with respect to the predicted\nparameters is zero almost everywhere. Existing gradient-based DFL approaches\nfor LPs try to circumvent this issue in one of two ways: (a) smoothing the LP\ninto a differentiable optimization problem by adding a quadratic regularizer\nand then minimizing the regret directly or (b) minimizing surrogate losses that\nhave informative (sub)gradients. In this paper, we show that the former\napproach still results in zero gradients, because even after smoothing the\nregret remains constant across large regions of the parameter space. To address\nthis, we propose minimizing surrogate losses -- even when a differentiable\noptimization layer is used and regret can be minimized directly.

However, existing methods for CBT learning\nsuch as conventional machine learning and graph neural networks (GNNs) are\nhindered by several limitations. These include: (i) poor interpretability due\nto their black-box nature, (ii) high computational cost, and (iii) an exclusive\nfocus on structure and topology, overlooking the cognitive capacity of the\ngenerated CBT. To address these challenges, we introduce mCOCO (multi-sensory\nCOgnitive COmputing), a novel framework that leverages Reservoir Computing (RC)\nto learn population-level functional CBT from BOLD\n(Blood-Oxygen-level-Dependent) signals. RC's dynamic system properties allow\nfor tracking state changes over time, enhancing interpretability and enabling\nthe modeling of brain-like dynamics, as demonstrated in prior literature. By\nintegrating multi-sensory inputs (e.g., text, audio, and visual data), mCOCO\ncaptures not only structure and topology but also how brain regions process\ninformation and adapt to cognitive tasks such as sensory processing, all in a\ncomputationally efficient manner. Our mCOCO framework consists of two phases:\n(1) mapping BOLD signals into the reservoir to derive individual functional\nconnectomes, which are then aggregated into a group-level CBT - an approach, to\nthe best of our knowledge, not previously explored in functional connectivity\nstudies - and (2) incorporating multi-sensory inputs through a cognitive\nreservoir, endowing the CBT with cognitive traits. Extensive evaluations show\nthat our mCOCO-based template significantly outperforms GNN-based CBT in terms\nof centeredness, discriminativeness, topological soundness, and multi-sensory\nmemory retention.

Specifically, in the scenario parameter space, a hierarchical\nrepresentation framework combines dimensionality reduction and\nmulti-dimensional subspace evaluation to efficiently localize diverse and\ncritical subspaces. This guides dynamic coordination between two generation\nmodes: local perturbation and global exploration, optimizing critical scenario\nquantity and diversity. Complementarily, in the agent behavior space,\nagent-environment interaction data are leveraged to quantify behavioral\ncriticality/diversity and adaptively support generation mode switching, forming\na closed feedback loop that continuously enhances scenario characterization and\nexploration within the parameter space.

Conventional explainable\nartificial-intelligence methods clarify individual predictions but overlook the\nupstream decisions and downstream quality checks that determine whether\ninsights can be trusted. In this work, we present Holistic Explainable\nArtificial Intelligence (HXAI), a user-centric framework that embeds\nexplanation into every stage of the data-analysis workflow and tailors those\nexplanations to users. HXAI unifies six components (data, analysis set-up,\nlearning process, model output, model quality, communication channel) into a\nsingle taxonomy and aligns each component with the needs of domain experts,\ndata analysts and data scientists. A 112-item question bank covers these needs;\nour survey of contemporary tools highlights critical coverage gaps. Grounded in\ntheories of human explanation, principles from human-computer interaction and\nfindings from empirical user studies, HXAI identifies the characteristics that\nmake explanations clear, actionable and cognitively manageable.
