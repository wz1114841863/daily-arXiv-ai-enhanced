Computing-in-Memory (CIM)\noffers a promising solution by storing document embeddings in CIM macros and\nenabling in-situ parallel retrievals but is constrained by either low memory\ndensity or limited computational accuracy. To address these challenges, we\npresent DIRCRAG, a novel edge RAG acceleration architecture leveraging Digital\nIn-ReRAM Computation (DIRC). DIRC integrates a high-density multi-level ReRAM\nsubarray with an SRAM cell, utilizing SRAM and differential sensing for robust\nReRAM readout and digital multiply-accumulate (MAC) operations. By storing all\ndocument embeddings within the CIM macro, DIRC achieves ultra-low-power,\nsingle-cycle data loading, substantially reducing both energy consumption and\nlatency compared to offchip DRAM. A query-stationary (QS) dataflow is supported\nfor RAG tasks, minimizing on-chip data movement and reducing SRAM buffer\nrequirements. We introduce error optimization for the DIRC ReRAM-SRAM cell by\nextracting the bit-wise spatial error distribution of the ReRAM subarray and\napplying targeted bit-wise data remapping. An error detection circuit is also\nimplemented to enhance readout resilience against deviceand circuit-level\nvariations.

Seven PRNGs were evaluated,\nranging from low-quality linear congruential generators (LCGs) with known\nstatistical deficiencies to high-quality generators such as Mersenne Twister,\nPCG, and Philox. We applied these PRNGs to four distinct tasks: an\nepidemiological agent-based model (ABM), two independent from-scratch MNIST\nclassification implementations (Python/NumPy and C++), and a reinforcement\nlearning (RL) CartPole environment. Each experiment was repeated 30 times per\ngenerator using fixed seeds to ensure reproducibility, and outputs were\ncompared using appropriate statistical analyses.

The problem of optimizing the computing resources for distributed\nmachine learning (ML) and optimization is considered in this paper. Given a set\nof data distributed over a network of computing-nodes/servers, the idea is to\noptimally assign the CPU (central processing unit) usage while simultaneously\ntraining each computing node locally via its own share of data. This formulates\nthe problem as a co-optimization setup to (i) optimize the data processing and\n(ii) optimally allocate the computing resources. The information-sharing\nnetwork among the nodes might be time-varying, but with balanced weights to\nensure consensus-type convergence of the algorithm. The algorithm is all-time\nfeasible, which implies that the computing resource-demand balance constraint\nholds at all iterations of the proposed solution.

These reasoning steps in\nCoT are often assumed as a faithful reflection of the model's internal thinking\nprocess, and used to monitor unsafe intentions. However, we find many reasoning\nsteps don't truly contribute to LLMs' prediction. We measure the step-wise\ncausal influence of each reasoning step on the model's final prediction with a\nproposed True Thinking Score (TTS). We reveal that LLMs often interleave\nbetween true-thinking steps (which are genuinely used to produce the final\noutput) and decorative-thinking steps (which only give the appearance of\nreasoning but have minimal causal impact). Notably, only a small subset of the\ntotal reasoning steps have a high TTS that causally drive the model's\nprediction: e.g., for the AIME dataset, only an average of 2.3% of reasoning\nsteps in CoT have a TTS >= 0.7 (range: 0-1) under the Qwen-2.5 model.\nFurthermore, we identify a TrueThinking direction in the latent space of LLMs.\nBy steering along or against this direction, we can force the model to perform\nor disregard certain CoT steps when computing the final result.

This paper introduces a novel architecture that\nintegrates a self-supervised, Transformer-based Change Point Detection (CPD)\nmodule into the Option-Critic framework, enabling adaptive segmentation of\nstate trajectories and the discovery of options. The CPD module is trained\nusing heuristic pseudo-labels derived from intrinsic signals to infer latent\nshifts in environment dynamics without external supervision.

Despite this industry\ntrend, a unified comparison of FP and integer (INT) quantization across varying\ngranularities has been missing, leaving algorithm and hardware co-design\nwithout clear guidance. This paper fills that gap by systematically\ninvestigating the trade-offs between FP and INT formats. We reveal a critical\nperformance crossover: while FP excels in coarse-grained quantization, the\ncomparison at fine-grained (block-wise) levels is more nuanced. Our\ncomprehensive comparison demonstrates that for popular 8-bit fine-grained\nformats (e.g., MX with block size 32), MXINT8 is superior to its FP counterpart\nin both algorithmic accuracy and hardware efficiency. However, for 4-bit\nformats, FP (e.g., MXFP4, NVFP4) often holds an accuracy advantage , though we\nshow that NVINT4 can surpass NVFP4 when outlier-mitigation techniques like\nHadamard rotation are applied. We also introduce a symmetric clipping method\nthat resolves gradient bias in fine-grained low-bit INT training, enabling\nnearly lossless performance for MXINT8 training. These findings challenge the\ncurrent hardware trajectory, demonstrating that a one-size-fits-all FP approach\nis suboptimal and advocating that fine-grained INT formats, particularly\nMXINT8, offer a better balance of accuracy, power, and efficiency for future AI\naccelerators."}

This question is especially important in differentially private low-rank\napproximation, where one aims to preserve the top-$p$ structure of a\ndata-derived matrix while ensuring privacy. Prior work often analyzes Frobenius\nnorm error or changes in reconstruction quality, but these metrics can over- or\nunder-estimate true subspace distortion. The spectral norm, by contrast,\ncaptures worst-case directional error and provides the strongest utility\nguarantees. We establish new high-probability spectral-norm perturbation bounds\nfor symmetric matrices that refine the classical Eckart--Young--Mirsky theorem\nand explicitly capture interactions between a matrix $A \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n\n\\times n}$ and an arbitrary symmetric perturbation $E$. Under mild eigengap and\nnorm conditions, our bounds yield sharp estimates for $\\|(A + E)_p - A_p\\|$,\nwhere $A_p$ is the best rank-$p$ approximation of $A$, with improvements of up\nto a factor of $\\sqrt{n}$.

Here we first show that RNNs can replicate\nHMM emission statistics and then reverse-engineer the trained networks to\nuncover the mechanisms they implement. In the absence of inputs, the activity\nof trained RNNs collapses towards a single fixed point. When driven by\nstochastic input, trajectories instead exhibit noise-sustained dynamics along\nclosed orbits.
