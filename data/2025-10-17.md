### [1] [Efficiently Executing High-throughput Lightweight LLM Inference Applications on Heterogeneous Opportunistic GPU Clusters with Pervasive Context Management](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14024)
*Thanh Son Phung,Douglas Thain*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: 提出了一种称为"Pervasive Context Management"的技术，通过将LLM初始化上下文与实际推理解耦，在GPU中保留上下文直到不再需要，解决了HPC集群中LLM工作负载的长等待时间和高启动成本问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成式AI引入了新型HPC工作负载，但当前HPC集群设计无法有效支持，要么在静态批处理队列中等待时间过长，要么在资源抢占时反复支付昂贵的LLM启动成本。

Method: 将LLM初始化上下文与实际LLM推理解耦，并在GPU中保留上下文直到不再需要，这种技术称为"Pervasive Context Management"。

Result: 在事实验证应用中，使用相同数量的GPU将执行时间减少了72.1%（从3小时减少到48分钟），并能在集群中32.8%的GPU上进行机会性扩展，进一步将执行时间减少到13分钟。

Conclusion: Pervasive Context Management技术有效解决了HPC集群中LLM工作负载的效率和成本问题，显著提升了科学发现的加速能力。

Abstract: The rise of Generative AI introduces a new class of HPC workloads that
integrates lightweight LLMs with traditional high-throughput applications to
accelerate scientific discovery. The current design of HPC clusters is
inadequate to support this new class however, either incurring long wait times
on static batch queues or repeatedly paying expensive LLM startup costs upon
resource preemption. To circumvent both the long queues and high startup costs,
we propose to "decouple" the LLM initialization context from the actual LLM
inferences, and retain the context in GPUs until it is no longer needed, a
technique we term "Pervasive Context Management". We transform a fact
verification application to enable this technique, allowing it to reduce its
execution time by 72.1% (from 3 hours to 48 minutes) using the same amount of
GPUs, and scale opportunistically on 32.8% of all GPUs in the cluster and
further reduce the execution time to 13 minutes.

### [2] [Anonymized Network Sensing using C++26 std::execution on GPUs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14050)
*Michael Mandulak,Sayan Ghosh,S M Ferdous,Mahantesh Halappanavar,George Slota*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: 本文探讨了使用C++26 Senders模型在密集GPU系统上开发匿名网络感知图挑战的实践方面，实现了比串行GraphBLAS基线高达55倍的性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着网络数据包数据日益庞大，基于GPU的并行方法成为网络分析的主流，但面临主机-设备内存管理和复杂工作负载移植等启动挑战。可组合框架通过现代C++编程语言为GPU高效部署分析任务提供了解决方案。

Method: 采用C++26 Senders模型的异步数据操作链，将GPU作为一等执行资源，通过表达性和标准化的异步语义开发多GPU应用工作负载。

Result: 基于商品库的实现相比参考串行GraphBLAS基线，在8个NVIDIA A100 GPU上实现了高达55倍的性能改进。

Conclusion: 采用通用且高效的程序模型不会影响关键路径性能，相比低级别专有供应商编程模型，C++26 Senders模型为密集GPU系统提供了有效的网络感知解决方案。

Abstract: Large-scale network sensing plays a vital role in network traffic analysis
and characterization. As network packet data grows increasingly large, parallel
methods have become mainstream for network analytics. While effective,
GPU-based implementations still face start-up challenges in host-device memory
management and porting complex workloads on devices, among others. To mitigate
these challenges, composable frameworks have emerged using modern C++
programming language, for efficiently deploying analytics tasks on GPUs.
Specifically, the recent C++26 Senders model of asynchronous data operation
chaining provides a simple interface for bulk pushing tasks to varied device
execution contexts.
  Considering the prominence of contemporary dense-GPU platforms and
vendor-leveraged software libraries, such a programming model consider GPUs as
first-class execution resources (compared to traditional host-centric
programming models), allowing convenient development of multi-GPU application
workloads via expressive and standardized asynchronous semantics. In this
paper, we discuss practical aspects of developing the Anonymized Network
Sensing Graph Challenge on dense-GPU systems using the recently proposed C++26
Senders model. Adopting a generic and productive programming model does not
necessarily impact the critical-path performance (as compared to low-level
proprietary vendor-based programming models): our commodity library-based
implementation achieves up to 55x performance improvements on 8x NVIDIA A100
GPUs as compared to the reference serial GraphBLAS baseline.

### [3] [Cortex: Workflow-Aware Resource Pooling and Scheduling for Agentic Serving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14126)
*Nikos Pagonas,Yeounoh Chung,Kostis Kaffes,Arvind Krishnamurthy*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: Cortex是一个面向智能体工作负载的工作流感知服务平台，通过阶段隔离策略为工作流的不同阶段分配专属资源池，提升KV缓存利用率和吞吐量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决智能体工作流中不同阶段之间的计算和内存干扰问题，提高服务性能和可预测性。

Method: 采用阶段隔离策略，为智能体工作流的每个不同阶段配置专用资源池，优化资源分配和调度。

Result: 实现了更好的KV缓存利用率、更高的吞吐量和更可预测的性能表现。

Conclusion: Cortex为更先进的智能体原生服务范式奠定了基础，支持可扩展资源管理、工作流分支推测执行和共享的多层智能体状态缓存。

Abstract: We introduce Cortex, a prototype workflow-aware serving platform designed for
agentic workloads. The core principle of Cortex is stage isolation: it
provisions dedicated resource pools for each distinct stage of an agentic
workflow. This simple yet powerful strategy mitigates inter-stage interference
in compute and memory, leading to better KV cache utilization, higher
throughput, and more predictable performance. By customizing resource
allocation and scheduling within each distinct stage of agentic workflows,
Cortex lays the groundwork for more advanced, agent-native serving paradigms,
including malleable resource management, speculative execution of workflow
branches, and a shared, multi-tiered cache for "agentic state."

### [4] [Deadlock-free routing for Full-mesh networks without using Virtual Channels](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14730)
*Alejandro Cano,Cristóbal Camarero,Carmen Martínez,Ramón Beivide*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: TERA是一种新型路由算法，在Full-mesh网络中通过嵌入物理子网络提供无死锁的非最小路径，无需使用虚拟通道(VCs)，在对抗性流量下性能显著优于传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统高基数低直径网络使用虚拟通道避免死锁，但VCs带来面积、功耗和设计复杂度开销，限制了交换机可扩展性。

Method: 提出TERA算法，在Full-mesh网络中嵌入物理子网络来提供无死锁的非最小路径，完全避免使用虚拟通道。

Result: 在Full-mesh网络中，TERA比链路排序路由算法在对抗性流量下性能提升80%，在应用内核中提升100%；相比VC方法减少50%缓冲区需求；在2D-HyperX中比最先进算法性能提升32%。

Conclusion: TERA通过消除虚拟通道需求，在保持性能的同时显著降低了硬件开销，为高基数网络提供了更高效的路由解决方案。

Abstract: High-radix, low-diameter networks like HyperX and Dragonfly use a Full-mesh
core, and rely on multiple virtual channels (VCs) to avoid packet deadlocks in
adaptive routing. However, VCs introduce significant overhead in the switch in
terms of area, power, and design complexity, limiting the switch scalability.
This paper starts by revisiting VC-less routing through link ordering schemes
in Full-mesh networks, which offer implementation simplicity but suffer from
performance degradation under adversarial traffic. Thus, to overcome these
challenges, we propose TERA (Topology-Embedded Routing Algorithm), a novel
routing algorithm which employs an embedded physical subnetwork to provide
deadlock-free non-minimal paths without using VCs.
  In a Full-mesh network, TERA outperforms link ordering routing algorithms by
80% when dealing with adversarial traffic, and up to 100% in application
kernels. Furthermore, compared to other VC-based approaches, it reduces buffer
requirements by 50%, while maintaining comparable latency and throughput.
Lastly, early results from a 2D-HyperX evaluation show that TERA outperforms
state-of-the-art algorithms that use the same number of VCs, achieving
performance improvements of up to 32%.

### [5] [Distributed-Memory Parallel Algorithms for Fixed-Radius Near Neighbor Graph Construction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14147)
*Gabriel Raulet,Dmitriy Morozov,Aydin Buluc,Katherine Yelick*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种可扩展的分布式内存算法，使用覆盖树在通用度量空间中计算固定半径近邻图，相比现有技术实现了显著的加速比。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着计算能力和数据采集方法的进步，大型科学数据集需要可扩展的近邻图计算解决方案。现有并行近邻算法主要关注欧几里得空间和近似解，但许多应用需要精确解和非欧几里得度量。

Method: 提出了共享内存的覆盖树构建算法，以及两种分布式内存算法：简单的点分区策略和空间分区策略，在节点上利用覆盖树算法。

Result: 在真实世界高维数据集上，使用1024核时相比现有技术实现了678.34倍加速（平均每个顶点70个邻居），使用4096核时实现了1590.99倍加速（平均每个顶点500个邻居）。

Conclusion: 该算法在各种真实和合成数据集上表现出良好的并行扩展性，适用于传统和非传统度量空间。

Abstract: Computing fixed-radius near-neighbor graphs is an important first step for
many data analysis algorithms. Near-neighbor graphs connect points that are
close under some metric, endowing point clouds with a combinatorial structure.
As computing power and data acquisition methods advance, diverse sources of
large scientific datasets would greatly benefit from scalable solutions to this
common subroutine for downstream analysis. Prior work on parallel nearest
neighbors has made great progress in problems like k-nearest and approximate
nearest neighbor search problems, with particular attention on Euclidean
spaces. Yet many applications need exact solutions and non-Euclidean metrics.
This paper presents a scalable sparsity-aware distributed memory algorithm
using cover trees to compute near-neighbor graphs in general metric spaces. We
provide a shared-memory algorithm for cover tree construction and demonstrate
its competitiveness with state-of-the-art fixed-radius search data structures.
We then introduce two distributed-memory algorithms for the near-neighbor graph
problem, a simple point-partitioning strategy and a spatial-partitioning
strategy, which leverage the cover tree algorithm on each node. Our algorithms
exhibit parallel scaling across a variety of real and synthetic datasets for
both traditional and non-traditional metrics. On real world high dimensional
datasets with one million points, we achieve speedups up to 678.34x over the
state-of-the-art using 1024 cores for graphs with 70 neighbors per vertex (on
average), and up to 1590.99x using 4096 cores for graphs with 500 neighbors per
vertex (on average).

### [6] [Privacy-Preserving and Incentive-Driven Relay-Based Framework for Cross-Domain Blockchain Interoperability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14151)
*Saeed Moradi,Koosha Esmaeilzadeh Khorasani,Sara Rouhani*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: 提出了一种区块链无关框架，实现许可链和无许可链之间的互操作性，通过加密技术确保安全数据交换，采用轻量级架构简化实现和维护，集成Clover和Dandelion++协议增强交易匿名性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 互操作性对于将区块链从孤立网络转变为协作生态系统至关重要。虽然公链互操作性已取得显著进展，但许可链和无许可链之间的桥接由于访问控制、架构和安全要求的差异而面临独特挑战。

Method: 引入区块链无关框架，利用加密技术确保安全数据交换，采用轻量级架构设计简化实现和维护，集成Clover和Dandelion++协议增强交易匿名性。

Result: 性能评估通过测量转发时间、吞吐量、可用性及其共谋影响，证明了该框架在异构区块链生态系统中实现安全高效互操作性的有效性。

Conclusion: 该框架成功解决了许可链和无许可链之间的互操作性挑战，为构建协作区块链生态系统提供了可行解决方案。

Abstract: Interoperability is essential for transforming blockchains from isolated
networks into collaborative ecosystems, unlocking their full potential. While
significant progress has been made in public blockchain interoperability,
bridging permissioned and permissionless blockchains poses unique challenges
due to differences in access control, architectures, and security requirements.
This paper introduces a blockchain-agnostic framework to enable
interoperability between permissioned and permissionless networks. Leveraging
cryptographic techniques, the framework ensures secure data exchanges. Its
lightweight architectural design simplifies implementation and maintenance,
while the integration of Clover and Dandelion++ protocols enhances transaction
anonymity. Performance evaluations demonstrate the framework's effectiveness in
achieving secure and efficient interoperability by measuring the forwarding
time, the throughput, the availability, and their collusion impact of the
system across heterogeneous blockchain ecosystems.

### [7] [Proof-Carrying Fair Ordering: Asymmetric Verification for BFT via Incremental Graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14186)
*Pengkun Ren,Hai Dong,Nasrin Sohrabi,Zahir Tari,Pengcheng Zhang*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: AUTIG是一个高性能、可插拔的订单公平性服务，通过非对称架构解决BFT共识中订单公平性问题，避免了传统对称协议中所有副本都需要重新计算昂贵排序计算的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的订单公平共识协议（如Themis）要求每个副本重新运行领导者的昂贵排序计算进行验证，这种对称冗余范式效率低下。AUTIG旨在打破这种对称性，提高性能。

Method: 采用非对称架构：领导者维护持久化的未确认交易增量图（UTIG）来分摊多轮图的构建成本，并随每个提案发出结构化公平性证明；跟随者无需维护历史状态即可验证证明。

Result: 实验表明，在部分同步条件下，AUTIG相比对称图基线具有更高的吞吐量和更低的端到端延迟，同时保持gamma批次订单公平性。

Conclusion: AUTIG通过创新的非对称架构、增量图维护和解耦流水线设计，成功实现了高性能的订单公平性服务，验证了验证公平订单无需重新计算的核心理念。

Abstract: Byzantine Fault-Tolerant (BFT) consensus protocols ensure agreement on
transaction ordering despite malicious actors, but unconstrained ordering power
enables sophisticated value extraction attacks like front running and sandwich
attacks - a critical threat to blockchain systems. Order-fair consensus curbs
adversarial value extraction by constraining how leaders may order
transactions. While state-of-the-art protocols such as Themis attain strong
guarantees through graph-based ordering, they ask every replica to re-run the
leader's expensive ordering computation for validation - an inherently
symmetric and redundant paradigm. We present AUTIG, a high-performance,
pluggable order-fairness service that breaks this symmetry. Our key insight is
that verifying a fair order does not require re-computing it. Instead,
verification can be reduced to a stateless audit of succinct, verifiable
assertions about the ordering graph's properties. AUTIG realizes this via an
asymmetric architecture: the leader maintains a persistent
Unconfirmed-Transaction Incremental Graph (UTIG) to amortize graph construction
across rounds and emits a structured proof of fairness with each proposal;
followers validate the proof without maintaining historical state. AUTIG
introduces three critical innovations: (i) incremental graph maintenance driven
by threshold-crossing events and state changes; (ii) a decoupled pipeline that
overlaps leader-side collection/update/extraction with follower-side stateless
verification; and (iii) a proof design covering all internal pairs in the
finalized prefix plus a frontier completeness check to rule out hidden external
dependencies. We implement AUTIG and evaluate it against symmetric graph-based
baselines under partial synchrony. Experiments show higher throughput and lower
end-to-end latency while preserving gamma-batch-order-fairness.

### [8] [FairBatching: Fairness-Aware Batch Formation for LLM Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14392)
*Hongtao Lyu,Boyue Liu,Mingyu Wu,Haibo Chen*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: FairBatching是一个新的LLM推理调度器，通过公平分配预填充和解码任务的计算资源，解决了现有调度器中的计算不公平问题，显著降低了TTFT延迟并提高了系统容量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM推理调度器在最小化TTFT延迟和维持高令牌生成率之间存在冲突，Sarathi提出的无停顿批处理调度器虽然防止了解码停顿，但引入了显著的计算不公平性，过度优先解码任务导致预填充队列延迟和系统QoS下降。

Method: 提出FairBatching调度器，采用自适应批容量确定机制动态调整计算预算，公平动态批形成算法打破解码优先范式，允许从突发解码任务回收计算资源服务预填充激增，并提供新颖的负载估计方法。

Result: 在真实跟踪评估中，FairBatching将TTFT尾部延迟降低达2.29倍，稳健维持TPOT SLOs，实现单节点容量20.0%提升和集群级容量54.3%提升。

Conclusion: FairBatching通过公平资源分配和自适应调度机制，有效解决了LLM推理系统中的计算不公平问题，显著提升了系统性能和容量。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) inference systems face a fundamental tension
between minimizing Time-to-First-Token (TTFT) latency for new requests and
maintaining a high, steady token generation rate (low Time-Per-Output-Token, or
TPOT) for ongoing requests. Existing stall-free batching schedulers proposed by
Sarathi, while effective at preventing decode stalls, introduce significant
computational unfairness. They prioritize decode tasks excessively,
simultaneously leading to underutilized decode slack and unnecessary prefill
queuing delays, which collectively degrade the system's overall quality of
service (QoS).
  This work identifies the root cause of this unfairness: the non-monotonic
nature of Time-Between-Tokens (TBT) as a scheduling metric and the rigid
decode-prioritizing policy that fails to adapt to dynamic workload bursts. We
therefore propose FairBatching, a novel LLM inference scheduler that enforces
fair resource allocation between prefill and decode tasks. It features an
adaptive batch capacity determination mechanism, which dynamically adjusts the
computational budget to improve the GPU utilization without triggering SLO
violations. Its fair and dynamic batch formation algorithm breaks away from the
decode-prioritizing paradigm, allowing computation resources to be reclaimed
from bursting decode tasks to serve prefill surges, achieving global fairness.
Furthermore, FairBatching provides a novel load estimation method, enabling
more effective coordination with upper-level schedulers. Implemented and
evaluated on realistic traces, FairBatching significantly reduces TTFT tail
latency by up to 2.29x while robustly maintaining TPOT SLOs, achieving overall
20.0% improvement in single-node capacity and 54.3% improvement in
cluster-level capacity.

*Hyein Woo,Miryeong Kwon,Jiseon Kim,Eunjee Na,Hanjin Choi,Seonghyeon Jang,Myoungsoo Jung*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: ScalePool是一种新型集群架构，通过统一硬件互连技术连接大量加速器，采用XLink-CXL混合结构实现低延迟通信和可扩展内存共享，显著提升LLM训练性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统长距离网络互连在加速器集群中存在延迟高、互操作性差的问题，需要一种统一的硬件互连架构来解决异构集群操作和资源解耦的挑战。

Method: 采用XLink-CXL混合结构：XLink用于集群内低延迟加速器通信，分层CXL交换结构用于可扩展的集群间内存共享。引入显式内存分层策略，第一层结合加速器本地内存与CXL/XLink，第二层使用专用内存节点通过CXL互连。

Result: 相比传统RDMA环境，LLM训练平均加速1.22倍，最高达1.84倍；第二层内存解耦策略使内存密集型工作负载延迟降低最高4.5倍。

Conclusion: ScalePool通过统一的硬件互连架构有效解决了加速器集群的互操作性和资源解耦问题，显著提升了训练性能和内存访问效率。

Abstract: This paper proposes ScalePool, a novel cluster architecture designed to
interconnect numerous accelerators using unified hardware interconnects rather
than traditional long-distance networking. ScalePool integrates
Accelerator-Centric Links (XLink) and Compute Express Link (CXL) into a unified
XLink-CXL hybrid fabric. Specifically, ScalePool employs XLink for
intra-cluster, low-latency accelerator communication, while using hierarchical
CXL-based switching fabrics for scalable and coherent inter-cluster memory
sharing. By abstracting interfaces through CXL, ScalePool structurally resolves
interoperability constraints, enabling heterogeneous cluster operation and
composable resource disaggregation. In addition, ScalePool introduces explicit
memory tiering: the latency-critical tier-1 combines accelerator-local memory
with coherence-centric CXL and XLink, whereas the highcapacity tier-2 employs
dedicated memory nodes interconnected by a CXL-based fabric, achieving scalable
and efficient memory pooling. Evaluation results show that ScalePool
accelerates LLM training by 1.22x on average and up to 1.84x compared to
conventional RDMA-based environments. Furthermore, the proposed tier-2 memory
disaggregation strategy reduces latency by up to 4.5x for memory-intensive
workloads.

*Michal Konopa,Jan Fesl,Ladislav Ber ánek*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: JASDA是一个基于拍卖理论和在线优化的去中心化GPU调度框架，通过双向迭代协商过程实现可扩展的资源管理


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统集中式调度在MIG-enabled GPU上难以应对工作负载的复杂性和时间变异性，需要更可扩展的解决方案

Method: 扩展SJA概念，采用去中心化协商：作业主动生成和评分可行子作业，调度器执行策略驱动的清算，平衡利用率、公平性和时间响应性

Result: 通过嵌入反馈、校准和概率安全到调度循环中，实现了自适应和透明的决策制定

Conclusion: JASDA为现代MIG-enabled环境提供了市场感知和公平驱动的可扩展资源管理基础，连接了理论调度模型与实际部署

Abstract: The increasing complexity and temporal variability of workloads on
MIG-enabled GPUs challenge the scalability of traditional centralized
scheduling. Building upon the SJA concept, this paper introduces JASDA-a novel
paradigm that extends SJA from a largely centralized scheduling model toward a
fully decentralized negotiation process. In JASDA, jobs actively generate and
score feasible subjobs in response to scheduler-announced execution windows,
while the scheduler performs policy-driven clearing that balances utilization,
fairness, and temporal responsiveness. This bidirectional, iterative
interaction embeds feedback, calibration, and probabilistic safety directly
into the scheduling loop, enabling adaptive and transparent decision-making. By
coupling principles from auction theory and online optimization with the
temporal granularity of GPU workloads, JASDA provides a scalable foundation for
market-aware and fairness-driven resource management-bridging theoretical
scheduling models with practical deployment in modern MIG-enabled environments
relevant to Artificial Intelligence and Agriculture 4.0.

TL;DR: MPI-over-CXL是一种利用CXL技术的新型MPI通信范式，通过共享内存访问替代传统数据拷贝方法，显著降低通信延迟和内存带宽使用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统MPI实现依赖显式内存拷贝操作，导致冗余数据移动和缓冲区管理的开销，特别是在涉及密集处理器间通信的HPC工作负载中影响显著。

Method: 利用CXL提供跨多主机的缓存一致性共享内存，将共享内存区域直接映射到MPI进程的虚拟地址空间，实现高效的基于指针的通信，消除冗余拷贝操作。

Result: 使用代表性基准测试进行评估，相比传统MPI系统显示出显著的性能提升。

Conclusion: MPI-over-CXL有潜力在大规模HPC环境中提高效率和可扩展性。

Abstract: MPI implementations commonly rely on explicit memory-copy operations,
incurring overhead from redundant data movement and buffer management. This
overhead notably impacts HPC workloads involving intensive inter-processor
communication. In response, we introduce MPI-over-CXL, a novel MPI
communication paradigm leveraging CXL, which provides cache-coherent shared
memory across multiple hosts. MPI-over-CXL replaces traditional data-copy
methods with direct shared memory access, significantly reducing communication
latency and memory bandwidth usage. By mapping shared memory regions directly
into the virtual address spaces of MPI processes, our design enables efficient
pointer-based communication, eliminating redundant copying operations. To
validate this approach, we implement a comprehensive hardware and software
environment, including a custom CXL 3.2 controller, FPGA-based multi-host
emulation, and dedicated software stack. Our evaluations using representative
benchmarks demonstrate substantial performance improvements over conventional
MPI systems, underscoring MPI-over-CXL's potential to enhance efficiency and
scalability in large-scale HPC environments.

Motivation: 为了解决企业级大规模LLM服务中的性能瓶颈和资源利用率问题，需要设计一个能够充分利用AI加速器的高性能推理框架。

Method: 构建解耦的服务-引擎架构：服务层包含智能调度模块、动态Prefill-Decode解耦策略和分布式KV缓存管理；引擎层通过多级执行流水线优化、自适应图模式和xTensor内存管理来饱和计算资源。

Result: 在相同TPOT约束下，xLLM的吞吐量达到MindIE的1.7倍和vLLM-Ascend的2.2倍（使用Qwen系列模型），在使用Deepseek系列模型时平均吞吐量为MindIE的1.7倍。

Conclusion: xLLM通过创新的架构设计和深度优化，在性能和资源效率方面显著优于现有解决方案，为企业级LLM服务提供了高效可靠的推理框架。

Abstract: We introduce xLLM, an intelligent and efficient Large Language Model (LLM)
inference framework designed for high-performance, large-scale enterprise-grade
serving, with deep optimizations for diverse AI accelerators. To address these
challenges, xLLM builds a novel decoupled service-engine architecture. At the
service layer, xLLM-Service features an intelligent scheduling module that
efficiently processes multimodal requests and co-locates online and offline
tasks through unified elastic scheduling to maximize cluster utilization. This
module also relies on a workload-adaptive dynamic Prefill-Decode (PD)
disaggregation policy and a novel Encode-Prefill-Decode (EPD) disaggregation
policy designed for multimodal inputs. Furthermore, it incorporates a
distributed architecture to provide global KV Cache management and robust
fault-tolerant capabilities for high availability. At the engine layer,
xLLM-Engine co-optimizes system and algorithm designs to fully saturate
computing resources. This is achieved through comprehensive multi-layer
execution pipeline optimizations, an adaptive graph mode and an xTensor memory
management. xLLM-Engine also further integrates algorithmic enhancements such
as optimized speculative decoding and dynamic EPLB, collectively serving to
substantially boost throughput and inference efficiency. Extensive evaluations
demonstrate that xLLM delivers significantly superior performance and resource
efficiency. Under identical TPOT constraints, xLLM achieves throughput up to
1.7x that of MindIE and 2.2x that of vLLM-Ascend with Qwen-series models, while
maintaining an average throughput of 1.7x that of MindIE with Deepseek-series
models. xLLM framework is publicly available at

### [13] [Balls and Bins and the Infinite Process with Random Deletions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14798)
*Petra Berenbrink,Tom Friedetzky,Peter Kling,Lars Nagel*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: Error


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We consider an infinite balls-into-bins process with deletions where in each
discrete step $t$ a coin is tossed as to whether, with probability $\beta(t)
\in (0,1)$, a new ball is allocated using the Greedy[2] strategy (which places
the ball in the lower loaded of two bins sampled uniformly at random) or, with
remaining probability $1-\beta(t)$, a ball is deleted from a non-empty bin
chosen uniformly at random. Let $n$ be the number of bins and $m(t)$ the total
load at time $t$. We are interested in bounding the discrepancy $x_{\max}(t) -
m(t)/n$ (current maximum load relative to current average) and the overload
$x_{\max}(t) - m_{\max}(t)/n$ (current maximum load relative to highest average
observed so far).
  We prove that at an arbitrarily chosen time $t$ the total number of balls
above the average is $O(n)$ and that the discrepancy is $ O(\log(n))$. For the
discrepancy, we provide a matching lower bound. Furthermore we prove that at an
arbitrarily chosen time $t$ the overload is $\log\log(n)+O(1)$. For "good"
insertion probability sequences (in which the average load of time intervals
with polynomial length increases in expectation) we show that even the
discrepancy is bounded by $\log\log(n)+O(1)$.
  One of our main analytical tools is a layered induction, as per [ABKU99].
Since our model allows for rather more general scenarios than what was
previously considered, the formal analysis requires some extra ingredients as
well, in particular a detailed potential analysis. Furthermore, we simplify the
setup by applying probabilistic couplings to obtain certain "recovery"
properties, which eliminate much of the need for intricate and careful
conditioning elsewhere in the analysis.

### [14] [Large Language Models for Real-World IoT Device Identification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13817)
*Rameen Mahmood,Tousif Ahmed,Sai Teja Peddinti,Danny Yuxing Huang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于语义推理的物联网设备识别方法，将设备识别重新定义为异构网络元数据的语言建模任务，通过指令调优的LLaMA3.18B模型实现了高精度和可扩展的设备识别。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 物联网设备的快速扩张超出了当前识别方法的能力，给安全、隐私和网络问责带来了重大风险，特别是在元数据不完整、有噪声或被故意混淆的开放世界环境中。

Method: 构建语义推理管道，使用基于互信息和熵的稳定性评分引导的大型语言模型集成，为最大的真实世界物联网流量语料库IoT Inspector数据集生成高保真供应商标签，然后通过课程学习对量化的LLaMA3.18B模型进行指令调优。

Result: 模型在2,015个供应商上实现了98.25%的top-1准确率和90.73%的宏观准确率，同时对缺失字段、协议漂移和对抗性操作保持弹性。

Conclusion: 指令调优的大型语言模型为现实世界大规模设备识别提供了可扩展和可解释的基础。

Abstract: The rapid expansion of IoT devices has outpaced current identification
methods, creating significant risks for security, privacy, and network
accountability. These challenges are heightened in open-world environments,
where traffic metadata is often incomplete, noisy, or intentionally obfuscated.
We introduce a semantic inference pipeline that reframes device identification
as a language modeling task over heterogeneous network metadata. To construct
reliable supervision, we generate high-fidelity vendor labels for the IoT
Inspector dataset, the largest real-world IoT traffic corpus, using an ensemble
of large language models guided by mutual-information and entropy-based
stability scores. We then instruction-tune a quantized LLaMA3.18B model with
curriculum learning to support generalization under sparsity and long-tail
vendor distributions. Our model achieves 98.25% top-1 accuracy and 90.73% macro
accuracy across 2,015 vendors while maintaining resilience to missing fields,
protocol drift, and adversarial manipulation. Evaluation on an independent IoT
testbed, coupled with explanation quality and adversarial stress tests,
demonstrates that instruction-tuned LLMs provide a scalable and interpretable
foundation for real-world device identification at scale.

### [15] [MX+: Pushing the Limits of Microscaling Formats for Efficient Large Language Model Serving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14557)
*Jungi Lee,Junyong Park,Soohyun Cha,Jaehoon Cho,Jaewoong Sim*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出MX+格式，通过重新利用异常值的指数字段作为扩展尾数，在4位精度下显著提升大语言模型性能，且存储开销和速度损失可忽略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有低精度格式需要侵入式修改软件框架或难以被硬件厂商广泛采用，而超低位BFP变体因块内异常值问题导致语言模型性能不佳。

Method: 基于行业驱动的块浮点格式变体，提出MX+扩展，关键洞察是异常值不需要使用其指数字段，可重新用作扩展尾数以提高异常值元素的精度。

Result: MX+相比4位MX格式（MXFP4）显著提高了模型性能，存储开销和速度损失可忽略，为高效LLM推理提供了有吸引力的替代方案。

Conclusion: MX+是一种成本效益高且非侵入式的扩展，可无缝集成到微缩放格式中，在4位精度下提供更好的语言模型性能。

Abstract: Reduced-precision data formats are crucial for cost-effective serving of
large language models (LLMs). While numerous reduced-precision formats have
been introduced thus far, they often require intrusive modifications to the
software frameworks or are rather unconventional for widespread adoption across
hardware vendors. In this paper, we instead focus on recent industry-driven
variants of block floating-point (BFP) formats and conduct a comprehensive
analysis to push their limits for efficient LLM serving. Our analysis shows
that existing ultra low-bit BFP variants struggle to provide reasonable
language model performance due to outlier values in blocks. To address the
outliers with BFPs, we propose MX+, a cost-effective and non-intrusive
extension designed for seamless integration into the microscaling (MX) formats.
MX+ builds on the key insight that the outlier does not need to use its
exponent field in the element data type, which allows us to repurpose the
exponent field as an extended mantissa to increase the precision of the outlier
element. Our evaluation shows that MX+ achieves significantly higher model
performance compared to the 4-bit MX format (MXFP4) with negligible storage
overhead and slowdown, thus offering a compelling alternative to MXFP4 or MXFP6
for efficient LLM inference.

*Zixi Wang,Yushe Cao,Yubo Huang,Jinzhu Wei,Jingzehua Xu,Shuai Zhang,Xin Lai*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为STDW的自训练动态加权方法，通过动态平衡源域和目标域损失贡献来增强渐进域适应的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统渐进域适应方法在通过中间域和自训练缓解域偏移时，常面临知识迁移效率低或中间数据不完整的问题。

Method: 引入动态加权机制，通过时间变化超参数ϱ控制域特定学习强度，结合自训练生成伪标签并优化加权目标函数进行迭代模型更新。

Result: 在旋转MNIST、颜色偏移MNIST、肖像数据集和Cover Type数据集上的实验表明，STDW优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: 该工作为鲁棒渐进域适应提供了理论洞见和实用框架，在动态现实场景中具有应用潜力。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a new method called Self-Training with Dynamic
Weighting (STDW), which aims to enhance robustness in Gradual Domain Adaptation
(GDA) by addressing the challenge of smooth knowledge migration from the source
to the target domain. Traditional GDA methods mitigate domain shift through
intermediate domains and self-training but often suffer from inefficient
knowledge migration or incomplete intermediate data. Our approach introduces a
dynamic weighting mechanism that adaptively balances the loss contributions of
the source and target domains during training. Specifically, we design an
optimization framework governed by a time-varying hyperparameter $\varrho$
(progressing from 0 to 1), which controls the strength of domain-specific
learning and ensures stable adaptation. The method leverages self-training to
generate pseudo-labels and optimizes a weighted objective function for
iterative model updates, maintaining robustness across intermediate domains.
Experiments on rotated MNIST, color-shifted MNIST, portrait datasets, and the
Cover Type dataset demonstrate that STDW outperforms existing baselines.
Ablation studies further validate the critical role of $\varrho$'s dynamic
scheduling in achieving progressive adaptation, confirming its effectiveness in
reducing domain bias and improving generalization. This work provides both
theoretical insights and a practical framework for robust gradual domain
adaptation, with potential applications in dynamic real-world scenarios. The

*Hongzheng Chen,Bin Fan,Alexander Collins,Bastian Hagedorn,Evghenii Gaburov,Masahiro Masuda,Matthew Brookhart,Chris Sullivan,Jason Knight,Zhiru Zhang,Vinod Grover*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Tawa是一个自动化编译器，能从高级瓦片化程序自动生成高性能、warp专业化的GPU代码，解决了SIMT编程模型与任务并行硬件之间的不匹配问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代GPU的专用硬件单元支持高性能异步数据流执行，但传统的SIMT编程模型与这种任务并行硬件不匹配，导致开发人员需要手动编排复杂的低级通信和软件管道，这既费时又容易出错。

Method: 提出Tawa编译器，采用新型IR抽象——异步引用(aref)来表达warp级通信，无需暴露低级硬件细节。Tawa自动将程序划分为生产者-消费者角色，并管理复杂的数据流管道。

Result: 在NVIDIA H100 GPU上的评估显示，Tawa实现了高硬件利用率，相比高度优化的cuBLAS GEMM内核达到1.1倍加速。对于注意力工作负载，相比Triton达到1.2倍加速，且与手工优化的CUTLASS C++ FlashAttention-3内核性能相当，但编程工作量大幅减少。

Conclusion: Tawa通过自动化warp专业化代码生成，显著降低了GPU编程的复杂性，在保持高性能的同时大幅减少了开发工作量。

Abstract: Modern GPUs feature specialized hardware units that enable high-performance,
asynchronous dataflow execution. However, the conventional SIMT programming
model is fundamentally misaligned with this task-parallel hardware, creating a
significant programmability gap. While hardware-level warp specialization is
the key to unlocking peak performance, it forces developers to manually
orchestrate complex, low-level communication and software pipelines--a process
that is labor-intensive, error-prone, and unsustainable. To address this
challenge, we present Tawa, an automated compiler that systematically generates
high-performance, warp-specialized code from a high-level, tile-based program.
Central to our approach is a novel IR abstraction, asynchronous references
(aref), which expresses warp-level communication without exposing low-level
hardware details. Using this abstraction, Tawa automatically partitions
programs into producer-consumer roles and manages the intricate dataflow
pipeline, relieving developers of invasive kernel rewriting. Evaluation on
NVIDIA H100 GPUs across representative LLM kernels shows that Tawa delivers
high hardware utilization, achieving up to 1.1$\times$ speedup over highly
optimized cuBLAS GEMM kernels. For attention workloads, Tawa attains
1.2$\times$ speedup over Triton and matches the performance of the
hand-optimized CUTLASS C++ FlashAttention-3 kernel with far less programming
effort.

TL;DR: Deep Edge Filter通过高通滤波深度神经网络特征来提升模型泛化能力，假设高频分量包含任务相关语义信息，低频分量包含领域特定偏差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 假设神经网络在深度特征的高频分量中编码任务相关语义信息，而在低频分量中存储领域特定偏差，通过分离这些分量来提升模型泛化性。

Method: 从原始特征中减去低通滤波输出，隔离可泛化表示同时保持架构完整性，实现特征稀疏化和高频分量分离。

Result: 在视觉、文本、3D和音频等多个领域的实验中，无论模型架构和数据模态如何，都显示出一致的性能提升。

Conclusion: 该方法有效验证了核心假设，通过特征稀疏化和高频分量隔离显著提升了模型泛化能力，且具有跨领域适用性。

Abstract: We introduce the Deep Edge Filter, a novel approach that applies high-pass
filtering to deep neural network features to improve model generalizability.
Our method is motivated by our hypothesis that neural networks encode
task-relevant semantic information in high-frequency components while storing
domain-specific biases in low-frequency components of deep features. By
subtracting low-pass filtered outputs from original features, our approach
isolates generalizable representations while preserving architectural
integrity. Experimental results across diverse domains such as Vision, Text,
3D, and Audio demonstrate consistent performance improvements regardless of
model architecture and data modality. Analysis reveals that our method induces
feature sparsification and effectively isolates high-frequency components,
providing empirical validation of our core hypothesis. The code is available at

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CoLoR-GAN提出了一种用于GAN的持续少样本学习方法，通过低秩适配技术减少参数数量，同时保持SOTA性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决GAN在持续学习中的挑战，特别是少样本学习时的灾难性遗忘问题，同时减少现有方法引入的大量新参数。

Method: 使用低秩张量适配模型，提出LLoRA技术优化卷积层适配器大小，并提供超参数选择的经验研究。

Result: 在多个基准CL和FS任务上验证了有效性，达到SOTA性能但资源需求大幅减少。

Conclusion: CoLoR-GAN是一个高效框架，能够同时处理少样本和持续学习，显著降低参数需求。

Abstract: Continual learning (CL) in the context of Generative Adversarial Networks
(GANs) remains a challenging problem, particularly when it comes to learn from
a few-shot (FS) samples without catastrophic forgetting. Current most effective
state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods, like LFS-GAN, introduce a non-negligible
quantity of new weights at each training iteration, which would become
significant when considering the long term. For this reason, this paper
introduces \textcolor{red}{\textbf{\underline{c}}}ontinual
few-sh\textcolor{red}{\textbf{\underline{o}}}t learning with
\textcolor{red}{\textbf{\underline{lo}}}w-\textcolor{red}{\textbf{\underline{r}}}ank
adaptation in GANs named CoLoR-GAN, a framework designed to handle both FS and
CL together, leveraging low-rank tensors to efficiently adapt the model to
target tasks while reducing even more the number of parameters required.
Applying a vanilla LoRA implementation already permitted us to obtain pretty
good results. In order to optimize even further the size of the adapters, we
challenged LoRA limits introducing a LoRA in LoRA (LLoRA) technique for
convolutional layers. Finally, aware of the criticality linked to the choice of
the hyperparameters of LoRA, we provide an empirical study to easily find the
best ones. We demonstrate the effectiveness of CoLoR-GAN through experiments on
several benchmark CL and FS tasks and show that our model is efficient,
reaching SOTA performance but with a number of resources enormously reduced.

*Xuwang Yin,Claire Zhang,Julie Steele,Nir Shavit,Tony T. Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出一种结合对抗训练的混合模型框架，同时实现鲁棒分类和高质量生成，解决了传统JEM模型训练不稳定和样本质量差的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在单一框架中同时实现鲁棒分类和高保真生成建模具有挑战性。传统联合能量模型(JEM)因基于SGLD的训练不稳定和样本质量差而受限。

Method: 1) 用基于对抗训练的稳定方法替代SGLD-based JEM学习；2) 协同对抗训练增强分类鲁棒性；3) 两阶段训练解决批归一化与EBM训练不兼容问题。

Result: 在CIFAR-10、CIFAR-100和ImageNet上显著提升对抗鲁棒性，同时保持竞争性生成性能。在ImageNet上生成质量超越BigGAN，接近扩散模型。

Conclusion: 该方法解决了JEM扩展的关键稳定性问题，证明对抗训练可作为统一视觉数据生成和鲁棒分类框架的有效基础。

Abstract: Simultaneously achieving robust classification and high-fidelity generative
modeling within a single framework presents a significant challenge. Hybrid
approaches, such as Joint Energy-Based Models (JEM), interpret classifiers as
EBMs but are often limited by the instability and poor sample quality inherent
in SGLD-based training. We address these limitations by proposing a novel
training framework that integrates adversarial training (AT) principles for
both discriminative robustness and stable generative learning. The proposed
method introduces three key innovations: (1) the replacement of SGLD-based JEM
learning with a stable, AT-based approach that optimizes the energy function by
discriminating between real data and PGD-generated contrastive samples using
the BCE loss; (2) synergistic adversarial training for the discriminative
component that enhances classification robustness while eliminating the need
for explicit gradient penalties; and (3) a two-stage training procedure to
resolve the incompatibility between batch normalization and EBM training.
Experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet demonstrate that our method
substantially improves adversarial robustness over existing hybrid models while
maintaining competitive generative performance. On ImageNet, when optimized for
generative modeling, our model's generative fidelity surpasses that of BigGAN
and approaches diffusion models, representing the first MCMC-based EBM approach
to achieve high-quality generation on complex, high-resolution datasets. Our
approach addresses key stability issues that have limited JEM scaling and
demonstrates that adversarial training can serve as an effective foundation for
unified frameworks capable of generating and robustly classifying visual data.

*Yifeng Yao,Yike Yun,Jing Wang,Huishuai Zhang,Dongyan Zhao,Ke Tian,Zhihao Wang,Minghui Qiu,Tao Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: K-frames提出了一种基于场景驱动的关键帧选择新范式，通过预测语义连贯的查询相关片段来保持时间连续性，支持任意数量的关键帧选择以适应不同用户预算。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多模态大语言模型在长视频理解中面临上下文窗口和计算成本的限制，均匀帧采样导致信息丢失，而现有关键帧选择方法产生的帧稀疏且时间不连续，缺乏多尺度选择的灵活性。

Method: 首先构建了包含20万个视频高光片段的PeakClips数据集，然后采用三阶段渐进式课程学习：两个监督微调阶段用于时间定位和关键片段感知，以及一个强化学习阶段直接优化场景驱动预测策略。

Result: 在主要长视频理解基准测试上的广泛实验表明，K-frames提供了有效、可解释且即插即用的多尺度关键帧选择解决方案。

Conclusion: K-frames通过场景驱动的关键帧选择方法，解决了长视频理解中的关键帧选择问题，在保持时间连续性的同时支持灵活的多尺度选择。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated significant
capabilities in image understanding, but long-video are constrained by context
windows and computational cost. Uniform frame sampling often leads to
substantial information loss. Meanwhile existing keyframe selection methods
such as text-frame retrieval or RL-based frame optimization typically yield
sparse and temporally disjointed frames, overlooking scene continuity and
lacking flexibility for multi-scale frame selection. To address these
limitations, we introduce K-frames, a novel paradigm for scene-driven keyframe
selection that preserves temporal continuity. Instead of selecting individual
frames, K-frames predicts semantically coherent, query-relevant clips, which
enables any-k keyframes selection to meet diverse user budgets. To achieve this
approach, we first introduce PeakClips, a dataset of 200K video highlights
conditioned by query. Building on this dataset, K-frames learns clip2frame
selection using a three-stage progressive curriculum. It involves two
Supervised Fine-Tuning stages for temporal grounding and key-clip perception,
followed by a Reinforcement Learning stage that directly optimizes the
scene-driven prediction policy for downstream task without further annotations.
Extensive experiments on major long-video understanding benchmarks demonstrate
that K-frames provides an effective, interpretable, and plug-and-play solution
for keyframe selection at various scales. Our dataset and model will be
available.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了多视图半监督标签分布学习方法MVSS-LDL，通过利用各视图的局部最近邻结构并强调多视图间的互补性，解决了多视图半监督标签分布学习问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的标签分布学习方法主要针对单视图和全监督场景，而多视图半监督标签分布学习问题尚未得到研究。

Method: 首先计算每个视图的k-最近邻结构，然后通过整合其他视图的最近邻信息来补充当前视图的最近邻集，最后基于补充后的最近邻集构建图学习模型。

Result: 数值研究表明，MVSS-LDL在分类性能上明显优于现有的单视图标签分布学习方法。

Conclusion: 这是首次尝试多视图标签分布学习，通过考虑局部最近邻结构的互补性，不同视图可以相互提供局部结构信息来补充彼此。

Abstract: Label distribution learning (LDL) is a paradigm that each sample is
associated with a label distribution. At present, the existing approaches are
proposed for the single-view LDL problem with labeled data, while the
multi-view LDL problem with labeled and unlabeled data has not been considered.
In this paper, we put forward the multi-view semi-supervised label distribution
learning with local structure complementarity (MVSS-LDL) approach, which
exploits the local nearest neighbor structure of each view and emphasizes the
complementarity of local nearest neighbor structures in multiple views.
Specifically speaking, we first explore the local structure of view $v$ by
computing the $k$-nearest neighbors. As a result, the $k$-nearest neighbor set
of each sample $\boldsymbol{x}_i$ in view $v$ is attained. Nevertheless, this
$k$-nearest neighbor set describes only a part of the nearest neighbor
information of sample $\boldsymbol{x}_i$. In order to obtain a more
comprehensive description of sample $\boldsymbol{x}_i$'s nearest neighbors, we
complement the nearest neighbor set in view $v$ by incorporating sample
$\boldsymbol{x}_i$'s nearest neighbors in other views. Lastly, based on the
complemented nearest neighbor set in each view, a graph learning-based
multi-view semi-supervised LDL model is constructed. By considering the
complementarity of local nearest neighbor structures, different views can
mutually provide the local structural information to complement each other. To
the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt at multi-view LDL.
Numerical studies have demonstrated that MVSS-LDL attains explicitly better
classification performance than the existing single-view LDL methods.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出Weight Weaving方法，通过池化函数在λ参数搜索空间内整合模型权重，无需评估数据即可提升模型合并性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有模型合并方法严重依赖缩放超参数λ，但缺乏无需数据的λ设置原则，导致实践中不可行

Method: 使用用户定义的池化函数（如平均、随机选择或现有合并方法）在λ值搜索空间内池化模型权重

Result: 在三个ViT变体和三种实验设置中，该方法将多个模型合并方法的平均准确率提升高达15.9个百分点

Conclusion: Weight Weaving具有高模块化特性，与现有方法正交，无需评估数据，能显著提升模型合并性能

Abstract: Model merging provides a cost-effective and data-efficient combination of
specialized deep neural networks through parameter integration. This technique
leverages expert models across downstream tasks without requiring retraining.
Most model merging approaches critically depend on scaling hyper-parameters
$\lambda$, which weight each model's contribution globally or individually.
Principled approaches for setting scaling factors without accessing any data
(data-free) are scarce, often leading researchers to tune $\lambda$ using
privileged data from the evaluation set, which is obviously unfeasible in
practice. To address this limitation, we introduce Weight Weaving, a
plug-and-play technique that pools model weights across $\lambda$ values search
space using user-defined pooling functions, such as averaging, random
selection, or even existing model merging methods. Our method demonstrates high
modularity, imposing minimal constraints on the search space. It operates
orthogonally to existing model merging methods and eliminates evaluation data
requirements. We validate Weight Weaving across three ViT variants in three
experimental setups: vision multi-task learning, vision continual learning, and
domain generalization. Our method consistently improves the performance of
several model merging methods, achieving average accuracy gains of up to 15.9
percentage points in a data-free setting.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的ICD编码分配方法，将问题视为分类和排序任务，而非传统的纯分类任务，以考虑ICD代码的顺序重要性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床笔记中的ICD代码顺序对医疗诊断和报销至关重要，但现有方法将其视为纯分类任务，忽略了代码顺序的重要性。

Method: 从检索系统角度处理该任务，将ICD编码分配问题重新表述为分类和排序任务，以同时考虑代码分配和排序。

Result: 在正确排序主要诊断代码方面，模型准确率达到47%，远超现有最佳分类器的20%；在分类指标上，微F1和宏F1分数分别为0.6065和0.2904，优于之前最佳模型的0.597和0.2660。

Conclusion: 所提出的框架在识别高优先级代码方面具有优越能力，证明了考虑ICD代码顺序的重要性，并在分类和排序任务上都超越了现有方法。

Abstract: Clinical notes contain unstructured text provided by clinicians during
patient encounters. These notes are usually accompanied by a sequence of
diagnostic codes following the International Classification of Diseases (ICD).
Correctly assigning and ordering ICD codes are essential for medical diagnosis
and reimbursement. However, automating this task remains challenging.
State-of-the-art methods treated this problem as a classification task, leading
to ignoring the order of ICD codes that is essential for different purposes. In
this work, as a first attempt, we approach this task from a retrieval system
perspective to consider the order of codes, thus formulating this problem as a
classification and ranking task. Our results and analysis show that the
proposed framework has a superior ability to identify high-priority codes
compared to other methods. For instance, our model accuracy in correctly
ranking primary diagnosis codes is 47%, compared to 20% for the
state-of-the-art classifier. Additionally, in terms of classification metrics,
the proposed model achieves a micro- and macro-F1 scores of 0.6065 and 0.2904,
respectively, surpassing the previous best model with scores of 0.597 and
0.2660.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的数据保真度损失函数——分布一致性损失，用于逆问题中的信号恢复，通过分布级校准替代传统的逐点匹配，避免对测量噪声的过拟合。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的MSE等数据保真度损失函数追求与噪声测量值的逐点一致性，容易导致对噪声的过拟合。本文旨在开发一种更统计合理的数据保真度目标。

Method: 引入分布一致性损失，通过基于模型的概率评分对每个测量值进行分布级校准，测试观测测量值是否与当前估计所隐含的噪声分布在统计上一致。

Result: 在图像去噪中，使用DC损失替代MSE损失无需早停即可获得更高PSNR；在医学图像重建中，DC损失减少了高度迭代重建中的伪影，增强了手工正则化的效果。

Conclusion: DC损失为逆问题提供了一种统计基础更牢固、性能更优的替代传统保真度损失的方法。

Abstract: Recovering true signals from noisy measurements is a central challenge in
inverse problems spanning medical imaging, geophysics, and signal processing.
Current solutions balance prior assumptions regarding the true signal
(regularization) with agreement to noisy measured data (data-fidelity).
Conventional data-fidelity loss functions, such as mean-squared error (MSE) or
negative log-likelihood, seek pointwise agreement with noisy measurements,
often leading to overfitting to noise. In this work, we instead evaluate
data-fidelity collectively by testing whether the observed measurements are
statistically consistent with the noise distributions implied by the current
estimate. We adopt this aggregated perspective and introduce distributional
consistency (DC) loss, a data-fidelity objective that replaces pointwise
matching with distribution-level calibration using model-based probability
scores for each measurement. DC loss acts as a direct and practical plug-in
replacement for standard data consistency terms: i) it is compatible with
modern regularizers, ii) it is optimized in the same way as traditional losses,
and iii) it avoids overfitting to measurement noise even without the use of
priors. Its scope naturally fits many practical inverse problems where the
measurement-noise distribution is known and where the measured dataset consists
of many independent noisy values. We demonstrate efficacy in two key example
application areas: i) in image denoising with deep image prior, using DC
instead of MSE loss removes the need for early stopping and achieves higher
PSNR; ii) in medical image reconstruction from Poisson-noisy data, DC loss
reduces artifacts in highly-iterated reconstructions and enhances the efficacy
of hand-crafted regularization. These results position DC loss as a
statistically grounded, performance-enhancing alternative to conventional
fidelity losses for inverse problems.

Motivation: 解决全精度大语言模型在特定任务上部署时计算和内存开销大的问题，通过极低位量化实现高效推理。

Method: 结合三个关键技术：BitNet的SubLN模块、基于MiniLM的多头注意力蒸馏、以及作为关键预热步骤的持续预训练。

Conclusion: BitDistill提供了一种高效的方法，能够在保持任务性能的同时大幅降低大语言模型在特定下游任务上的部署成本。

Abstract: In this paper, we present BitNet Distillation (BitDistill), a lightweight
pipeline that fine-tunes off-the-shelf full-precision LLMs (e.g., Qwen) into
1.58-bit precision (i.e., ternary weights {-1, 0, 1}) for specific downstream
tasks, achieving strong task-specific performance with minimal computational
cost. Specifically, BitDistill incorporates three key techniques: the SubLN
module, as introduced in BitNet; multi-head attention distillation, based on
MiniLM; and continual pre-training, which serves as a crucial warm-up step to
mitigate the scalability issue of the performance gap between finetuned
full-precision and 1.58-bit LLMs on specific tasks. Experimental results show
that BitDistill achieves performance comparable to the full-precision
counterpart models across model size, while enabling up to 10x memory savings
and 2.65x faster inference on CPUs. Code is available at

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为REAP的新剪枝方法，证明在生成任务中专家剪枝优于专家合并，通过考虑路由器门值和专家激活范数来实现高效压缩。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 稀疏激活的专家混合模型虽然预训练效率高且延迟低，但参数量大导致显著内存开销，需要研究专家压缩方法。

Method: 提出Router-weighted Expert Activation Pruning (REAP)剪枝准则，综合考虑路由器门值和专家激活范数来选择要剪枝的专家。

Result: 在20B到1T参数的SMoE模型上，REAP在生成基准测试中始终优于合并和其他剪枝方法，特别是在50%压缩率下。在代码生成和工具调用任务中，即使剪枝50%专家也能实现近乎无损的压缩。

Conclusion: 专家剪枝是生成任务的更优策略，REAP方法通过避免功能子空间崩溃实现了高效的模型压缩。

Abstract: Sparsely-activated Mixture-of-Experts (SMoE) models offer efficient
pre-training and low latency but their large parameter counts create
significant memory overhead, motivating research into expert compression.
Contrary to recent findings favouring expert merging on discriminative
benchmarks, we demonstrate that expert pruning is a superior strategy for
generative tasks. We prove that merging introduces an irreducible error by
causing a "functional subspace collapse", due to the loss of the router's
independent, input-dependent control over experts. Leveraging this insight, we
propose Router-weighted Expert Activation Pruning (REAP), a novel pruning
criterion that considers both router gate-values and expert activation norms.
Across a diverse set of SMoE models ranging from 20B to 1T parameters, REAP
consistently outperforms merging and other pruning methods on generative
benchmarks, especially at 50% compression. Notably, our method achieves
near-lossless compression on code generation and tool-calling tasks with
Qwen3-Coder-480B and Kimi-K2, even after pruning 50% of experts.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了条件Clifford-可转向核来解决CSCNNs核基不完整的问题，通过输入特征场的等变表示增强核，在多个PDE预测任务中表现优于基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Clifford-可转向CNNs的核基不完整，限制了模型表达能力，需要解决这一问题以提高在物理系统建模中的性能。

Method: 提出条件Clifford-可转向核，通过输入特征场的等变表示增强核，推导这些输入依赖核的等变约束，并通过隐式参数化高效求解。

Result: 在流体动力学和相对论电动力学等多个PDE预测任务中，该方法始终优于基线方法，证明了改进的表达能力。

Conclusion: 条件Clifford-可转向核有效解决了CSCNNs核基不完整的问题，显著提升了模型在物理系统建模中的表达能力。

Abstract: Clifford-Steerable CNNs (CSCNNs) provide a unified framework that allows
incorporating equivariance to arbitrary pseudo-Euclidean groups, including
isometries of Euclidean space and Minkowski spacetime. In this work, we
demonstrate that the kernel basis of CSCNNs is not complete, thus limiting the
model expressivity. To address this issue, we propose Conditional
Clifford-Steerable Kernels, which augment the kernels with equivariant
representations computed from the input feature field. We derive the
equivariance constraint for these input-dependent kernels and show how it can
be solved efficiently via implicit parameterization. We empirically demonstrate
an improved expressivity of the resulting framework on multiple PDE forecasting
tasks, including fluid dynamics and relativistic electrodynamics, where our
method consistently outperforms baseline methods.

*Jie Hao,Xiaochuan Gong,Jie Xu,Zhengdao Wang,Mingrui Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种在几何感知优化算法基础上添加噪声自适应分层学习率的方法，通过估计梯度方差来动态调整同一组内各层的学习率，显著加速了深度神经网络训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的几何感知优化算法（如Muon）虽然通过为不同层选择合适范数来利用DNN的几何结构，但在同一组内各层使用固定学习率。然而，同一组内各层的局部曲率可能异质且动态变化，这种固定学习率策略可能效率低下。

Method: 在几何感知优化算法基础上，提出噪声自适应分层学习率方案。通过实时估计由所选LMO诱导的对偶范数中的梯度方差，为每个组内的各层分配随时间变化的噪声自适应学习率。

Result: 理论分析表明该算法实现了尖锐的收敛率。在LLaMA和GPT等transformer架构上的实证结果显示，该方法比最先进的优化器收敛更快。

Conclusion: 提出的噪声自适应分层学习率方案能够有效解决几何感知优化中同一组内各层学习率固定的问题，显著加速DNN训练，特别是在transformer架构上表现出优越性能。

Abstract: Geometry-aware optimization algorithms, such as Muon, have achieved
remarkable success in training deep neural networks (DNNs). These methods
leverage the underlying geometry of DNNs by selecting appropriate norms for
different layers and updating parameters via norm-constrained linear
minimization oracles (LMOs). However, even within a group of layers associated
with the same norm, the local curvature can be heterogeneous across layers and
vary dynamically over the course of training. For example, recent work shows
that sharpness varies substantially across transformer layers and throughout
training, yet standard geometry-aware optimizers impose fixed learning rates to
layers within the same group, which may be inefficient for DNN training.
  In this paper, we introduce a noise-adaptive layerwise learning rate scheme
on top of geometry-aware optimization algorithms and substantially accelerate
DNN training compared to methods that use fixed learning rates within each
group. Our method estimates gradient variance in the dual norm induced by the
chosen LMO on the fly, and uses it to assign time-varying noise-adaptive
layerwise learning rates within each group. We provide a theoretical analysis
showing that our algorithm achieves a sharp convergence rate. Empirical results
on transformer architectures such as LLaMA and GPT demonstrate that our
approach achieves faster convergence than state-of-the-art optimizers.

TL;DR: FedHFT是一个高效的个性化联邦微调框架，通过混合掩码适配器处理客户端资源异构性，并使用双层优化方法处理非独立同分布数据，在数据和资源异构条件下显著提升了自然语言理解任务的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决预训练大语言模型微调中的两个主要挑战：(i) 由于数据保密性或隐私要求导致的有限和/或异构数据；(ii) 边缘设备等参与客户端之间不同的计算资源可用性。

Method: 1. 引入混合掩码适配器处理客户端资源异构性，实现分布式环境中多客户端的高性能协作微调；2. 采用基于掩码个性化和客户端聚类的双层优化方法处理非独立同分布数据分布。

Result: 在数据和资源异构条件下，相比代表性异构联邦学习方法，在各种自然语言理解任务上实现了显著的性能和效率提升。

Conclusion: FedHFT框架有效解决了联邦学习中数据和资源异构的挑战，为个性化自然语言理解应用提供了高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Fine-tuning pre-trained large language models (LLMs) has become a common
practice for personalized natural language understanding (NLU) applications on
downstream tasks and domain-specific datasets. However, there are two main
challenges: (i) limited and/or heterogeneous data for fine-tuning due to
proprietary data confidentiality or privacy requirements, and (ii) varying
computation resources available across participating clients such as edge
devices. This paper presents FedHFT - an efficient and personalized federated
fine-tuning framework to address both challenges. First, we introduce a mixture
of masked adapters to handle resource heterogeneity across participating
clients, enabling high-performance collaborative fine-tuning of pre-trained
language model(s) across multiple clients in a distributed setting, while
keeping proprietary data local. Second, we introduce a bi-level optimization
approach to handle non-iid data distribution based on masked personalization
and client clustering. Extensive experiments demonstrate significant
performance and efficiency improvements over various natural language
understanding tasks under data and resource heterogeneity compared to
representative heterogeneous federated learning methods.

*Riccardo Zattra,Giacomo Baggio,Umberto Casti,Augusto Ferrante,Francesco Ticozzi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: COFFEE模型是一种新型的时间变化状态空间模型，通过引入状态反馈机制实现上下文依赖的选择性，在保持并行实现能力的同时，显著提升了长序列依赖建模能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer模型存在二次复杂度问题和长序列依赖建模困难，而现有状态空间模型（如Mamba的S6模块）的选择性机制仅依赖当前输入，缺乏对序列历史的上下文理解。

Method: COFFEE模型通过内部状态反馈来计算选择性机制，将状态作为序列历史的紧凑表示，并采用高效模型参数化消除S6中的冗余，实现更紧凑可训练的架构。

Result: 在induction head任务中，COFFEE以两个数量级更少的参数和训练序列达到接近完美的准确率；在MNIST上，仅用3585个参数就达到97%准确率，大幅超越S6。

Conclusion: 状态反馈是构建可扩展高效序列模型的关键机制，COFFEE展示了通过状态反馈实现上下文依赖选择性的有效性。

Abstract: Transformers, powered by the attention mechanism, are the backbone of most
foundation models, yet they suffer from quadratic complexity and difficulties
in dealing with long-range dependencies in the input sequence. Recent work has
shown that state space models (SSMs) provide an efficient alternative, with the
S6 module at the core of the Mamba architecture achieving state-of-the-art
results on long-sequence benchmarks. In this paper, we introduce the COFFEE
(COntext From FEEdback) model, a novel time-varying SSM that incorporates state
feedback to enable context-dependent selectivity, while still allowing for
parallel implementation. Whereas the selectivity mechanism of S6 only depends
on the current input, COFFEE computes it from the internal state, which serves
as a compact representation of the sequence history. This shift allows the
model to regulate its dynamics based on accumulated context, improving its
ability to capture long-range dependencies. In addition to state feedback, we
employ an efficient model parametrization that removes redundancies present in
S6 and leads to a more compact and trainable formulation. On the induction head
task, COFFEE achieves near-perfect accuracy with two orders of magnitude fewer
parameters and training sequences compared to S6. On MNIST, COFFEE largely
outperforms S6 within the same architecture, reaching 97% accuracy with only
3585 parameters. These results showcase the role of state feedback as a key
mechanism for building scalable and efficient sequence models.

Abstract: Federated learning promises to revolutionize machine learning by enabling
collaborative model training without compromising data privacy. However,
practical adaptability can be limited by critical factors, such as the
participation dilemma. Participating entities are often unwilling to contribute
to a learning system unless they receive some benefits, or they may pretend to
participate and free-ride on others. This chapter identifies the fundamental
challenges in designing incentive mechanisms for federated learning systems. It
examines how foundational concepts from economics and game theory can be
applied to federated learning, alongside technology-driven solutions such as
blockchain and deep reinforcement learning. This work presents a comprehensive
taxonomy that thoroughly covers both centralized and decentralized
architectures based on the aforementioned theoretical concepts. Furthermore,
the concepts described are presented from an application perspective, covering
emerging industrial applications, including healthcare, smart infrastructure,
vehicular networks, and blockchain-based decentralized systems. Through this
exploration, this chapter demonstrates that well-designed incentive mechanisms
are not merely optional features but essential components for the practical
success of federated learning. This analysis reveals both the promising
solutions that have emerged and the significant challenges that remain in
building truly sustainable, fair, and robust federated learning ecosystems.

TL;DR: 提出了一个新的因果表示学习基准，使用高保真模拟视觉数据，在保持真实视觉复杂性的同时提供真实因果生成过程的访问权限。数据集包含约20万张图像和300万视频帧，涵盖4个领域的24个子场景。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有因果表示学习评估方法面临两难困境：要么使用过于简化的合成数据集，要么依赖真实世界任务的下游性能，难以在真实性和评估精度之间取得平衡。

Method: 创建包含静态图像生成、动态物理模拟、机器人操作和交通情境分析四个领域的高保真模拟视觉数据集，提供对底层因果结构的灵活访问，允许用户修改或配置因果结构以符合CRL假设。

Result: 构建了包含约20万张图像和300万视频帧的综合测试平台，涵盖从静态到动态、简单到复杂结构、单到多智能体交互的多样化场景。

Conclusion: 该基准填补了严格评估和现实世界应用之间的差距，通过对代表性CRL方法的评估提供了实证见解，帮助从业者选择或扩展适当的CRL框架来解决实际问题。

Abstract: Causal Representation Learning (CRL) aims to uncover the data-generating
process and identify the underlying causal variables and relations, whose
evaluation remains inherently challenging due to the requirement of known
ground-truth causal variables and causal structure. Existing evaluations often
rely on either simplistic synthetic datasets or downstream performance on
real-world tasks, generally suffering a dilemma between realism and evaluative
precision. In this paper, we introduce a new benchmark for CRL using
high-fidelity simulated visual data that retains both realistic visual
complexity and, more importantly, access to ground-truth causal generating
processes. The dataset comprises around 200 thousand images and 3 million video
frames across 24 sub-scenes in four domains: static image generation, dynamic
physical simulations, robotic manipulations, and traffic situation analysis.
These scenarios range from static to dynamic settings, simple to complex
structures, and single to multi-agent interactions, offering a comprehensive
testbed that hopefully bridges the gap between rigorous evaluation and
real-world applicability. In addition, we provide flexible access to the
underlying causal structures, allowing users to modify or configure them to
align with the required assumptions in CRL, such as available domain labels,
temporal dependencies, or intervention histories. Leveraging this benchmark, we
evaluated representative CRL methods across diverse paradigms and offered
empirical insights to assist practitioners and newcomers in choosing or
extending appropriate CRL frameworks to properly address specific types of real
problems that can benefit from the CRL perspective. Welcome to visit our:

TL;DR: 该论文研究了稀疏maxout网络的表达能力，建立了网络与虚拟多面体之间的对偶关系，推导了深度层次结构，并证明了在固定入度约束下，宽度无法补偿深度不足的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究稀疏maxout网络（如卷积神经网络和图神经网络）的表达能力，理解其深度和宽度对网络性能的影响。

Method: 建立稀疏maxout网络与虚拟多面体类之间的对偶关系，利用多面体几何分析网络表达能力，推导维度界限并构建深度层次结构。

Result: 证明了足够深的稀疏maxout网络具有通用性，但在固定入度约束下，如果深度不足，仅增加宽度无法补偿表达能力的损失。

Conclusion: 稀疏maxout网络的表达能力受深度和入度约束的共同影响，深度在补偿稀疏性方面起着关键作用。

Abstract: We study the expressivity of sparse maxout networks, where each neuron takes
a fixed number of inputs from the previous layer and employs a, possibly
multi-argument, maxout activation. This setting captures key characteristics of
convolutional or graph neural networks. We establish a duality between
functions computable by such networks and a class of virtual polytopes, linking
their geometry to questions of network expressivity. In particular, we derive a
tight bound on the dimension of the associated polytopes, which serves as the
central tool for our analysis. Building on this, we construct a sequence of
depth hierarchies. While sufficiently deep sparse maxout networks are
universal, we prove that if the required depth is not reached, width alone
cannot compensate for the sparsity of a fixed indegree constraint.

<details>

Motivation: 传统随机对照试验依赖人工假设且分析成本高，限制了因果效应的大规模估计，可能遗漏重要但未被假设的效应。

Method: 使用预训练基础模型将非结构化试验数据转化为有意义的表示，通过稀疏自编码器进行解释，并引入Neural Effect Search递归程序通过渐进分层解决多重检验和效应纠缠问题。

Result: 在半合成实验中验证了算法的鲁棒性，并在实验生态学背景下首次在真实世界科学试验中成功实现了无监督因果效应识别。

Conclusion: 该方法能够直接从数据中发现未知的因果效应，突破了传统试验方法的限制，为大规模因果效应探索提供了新途径。

Abstract: Randomized Controlled Trials are one of the pillars of science; nevertheless,
they rely on hand-crafted hypotheses and expensive analysis. Such constraints
prevent causal effect estimation at scale, potentially anchoring on popular yet
incomplete hypotheses. We propose to discover the unknown effects of a
treatment directly from data. For this, we turn unstructured data from a trial
into meaningful representations via pretrained foundation models and interpret
them via a sparse autoencoder. However, discovering significant causal effects
at the neural level is not trivial due to multiple-testing issues and effects
entanglement. To address these challenges, we introduce Neural Effect Search, a
novel recursive procedure solving both issues by progressive stratification.
After assessing the robustness of our algorithm on semi-synthetic experiments,
we showcase, in the context of experimental ecology, the first successful
unsupervised causal effect identification on a real-world scientific trial.

Abstract: Reaction-diffusion systems represent one of the most fundamental formulations
used to describe a wide range of physical, chemical, and biological processes.
With the increasing adoption of neural networks, recent research has focused on
solving differential equations using machine learning techniques. However, the
theoretical foundation explaining why neural networks can effectively
approximate such solutions remains insufficiently explored.
  This paper provides a theoretical analysis of the approximation power of
neural networks for one- and two-dimensional reaction-diffusion equations in
both homogeneous and heterogeneous media. Building upon the universal
approximation theorem, we demonstrate that a two-layer neural network can
approximate the one-dimensional reaction-diffusion equation, while a
three-layer neural network can approximate its two-dimensional counterpart. The
theoretical framework presented here can be further extended to elliptic and
parabolic equations.
  Overall, this work highlights the expressive power of neural networks in
approximating solutions to reaction-diffusion equations and related PDEs,
providing a theoretical foundation for neural network-based differential
equation solvers.

Abstract: Systematic, compositional generalization beyond the training distribution
remains a core challenge in machine learning -- and a critical bottleneck for
the emergent reasoning abilities of modern language models. This work
investigates out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization in Transformer networks
using a GSM8K-style modular arithmetic on computational graphs task as a

at enhancing OOD generalization: (i) input-adaptive recurrence; (ii)
algorithmic supervision; (iii) anchored latent representations via a discrete
bottleneck; and (iv) an explicit error-correction mechanism. Collectively,
these mechanisms yield an architectural approach for native and scalable latent
space reasoning in Transformer networks with robust algorithmic generalization
capabilities. We complement these empirical results with a detailed mechanistic
interpretability analysis that reveals how these mechanisms give rise to robust
OOD generalization abilities.

Conclusion: TENDE提供了一种灵活、可扩展的转移熵估计方法，能够有效克服现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: Transfer entropy measures directed information flow in time series, and it
has become a fundamental quantity in applications spanning neuroscience,
finance, and complex systems analysis. However, existing estimation methods
suffer from the curse of dimensionality, require restrictive distributional
assumptions, or need exponentially large datasets for reliable convergence. We
address these limitations in the literature by proposing TENDE (Transfer
Entropy Neural Diffusion Estimation), a novel approach that leverages
score-based diffusion models to estimate transfer entropy through conditional
mutual information. By learning score functions of the relevant conditional
distributions, TENDE provides flexible, scalable estimation while making
minimal assumptions about the underlying data-generating process. We
demonstrate superior accuracy and robustness compared to existing neural
estimators and other state-of-the-art approaches across synthetic benchmarks
and real data.

Conclusion: 所提出的策略在允许的γ范围内，在遗憾与平均队列长度的权衡上达到对数因子内的最优性，与已知需求供给曲线情况下的最优结果相匹配。

Abstract: We study a two-sided market, wherein, price-sensitive heterogeneous customers
and servers arrive and join their respective queues. A compatible
customer-server pair can then be matched by the platform, at which point, they
leave the system. Our objective is to design pricing and matching algorithms
that maximize the platform's profit, while maintaining reasonable queue
lengths. As the demand and supply curves governing the price-dependent arrival
rates may not be known in practice, we design a novel online-learning-based
pricing policy and establish its near-optimality. In particular, we prove a
tradeoff among three performance metrics: $\tilde{O}(T^{1-\gamma})$ regret,
$\tilde{O}(T^{\gamma/2})$ average queue length, and $\tilde{O}(T^{\gamma})$
maximum queue length for $\gamma \in (0, 1/6]$, significantly improving over
existing results [1]. Moreover, barring the permissible range of $\gamma$, we
show that this trade-off between regret and average queue length is optimal up
to logarithmic factors under a class of policies, matching the optimal one as
in [2] which assumes the demand and supply curves to be known. Our proposed
policy has two noteworthy features: a dynamic component that optimizes the
tradeoff between low regret and small queue lengths; and a probabilistic
component that resolves the tension between obtaining useful samples for fast
learning and maintaining small queue lengths.

Abstract: Diffusion models enable the synthesis of highly accurate samples from complex
distributions and have become foundational in generative modeling. Recently,
they have demonstrated significant potential for solving Bayesian inverse
problems by serving as priors. This review offers a comprehensive overview of
current methods that leverage \emph{pre-trained} diffusion models alongside
Monte Carlo methods to address Bayesian inverse problems without requiring
additional training. We show that these methods primarily employ a
\emph{twisting} mechanism for the intermediate distributions within the
diffusion process, guiding the simulations toward the posterior distribution.
We describe how various Monte Carlo methods are then used to aid in sampling
from these twisted distributions.

technique, addressing the overlooked issue of domain-inconsistent solutions
arising from the interaction of parametrised neural network models with
optimisation solvers. Applied to a 1180 MW capacity combined cycle gas power
plant, our framework delivers domain-consistent robust optimal solutions that
achieve a verified 0.76 percentage point mean improvement in energy efficiency.
For the first time, scaling this efficiency gain to the global fleet of gas
power plants, we estimate an annual 26 Mt reduction potential in CO$_2$ (with
10.6 Mt in Asia, 9.0 Mt in the Americas, and 4.5 Mt in Europe). These results
underscore the synergetic role of machine learning in delivering near-term,
scalable decarbonisation pathways for global climate action.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文首次揭示了无监督强化学习中涌现探索的机制，通过理论分析和实验验证了SGCRL算法如何通过隐式奖励和表示学习驱动探索行为。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解无监督强化学习算法中探索行为的内在机制，特别是SGCRL算法如何在没有外部奖励或课程的情况下解决长时程目标达成任务。

Method: 结合理论分析SGCRL的目标函数与受控实验，研究算法如何通过学习表示来塑造隐式奖励，从而驱动探索行为。

Result: 发现SGCRL通过隐式奖励最大化驱动探索，这些表示自动修改奖励景观以在达到目标前促进探索、之后促进利用；探索动态源于状态空间的低秩表示学习而非神经网络函数逼近。

Conclusion: 对SGCRL探索机制的深入理解使其能够适配为执行安全感知的探索。

Abstract: In this work, we take a first step toward elucidating the mechanisms behind
emergent exploration in unsupervised reinforcement learning. We study
Single-Goal Contrastive Reinforcement Learning (SGCRL), a self-supervised
algorithm capable of solving challenging long-horizon goal-reaching tasks
without external rewards or curricula. We combine theoretical analysis of the
algorithm's objective function with controlled experiments to understand what
drives its exploration. We show that SGCRL maximizes implicit rewards shaped by
its learned representations. These representations automatically modify the
reward landscape to promote exploration before reaching the goal and
exploitation thereafter. Our experiments also demonstrate that these
exploration dynamics arise from learning low-rank representations of the state
space rather than from neural network function approximation. Our improved
understanding enables us to adapt SGCRL to perform safety-aware exploration.

*Faezeh Dehghan Tarzjani,Bhaskar Krishnamachari*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出D-GCN架构，通过解耦节点自身传输概率与邻居干扰效应，解决异构多跳无线网络中p-persistent CSMA协议吞吐量预测问题，显著优于标准GCN和传统分析方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统简化模型在稀疏拓扑中低估吞吐量48-62%，精确马尔可夫链分析计算复杂度指数增长，标准GNN因对称归一化混淆直接干扰与高阶级联效应而表现不佳（63.94% NMAE）。

Method: 设计解耦图卷积网络（D-GCN），用可学习注意力替代均值聚合，显式分离节点自身传输概率与邻居干扰效应，捕获复杂多跳干扰模式。

Result: D-GCN达到3.3% NMAE，优于强基线方法，在精确分析方法计算不可行时仍可处理，基于梯度的网络优化达到理论最优解的1%以内。

Conclusion: D-GCN通过结构化解耦设计有效解决了无线网络吞吐量预测的挑战，为大规模网络性能分析和优化提供了可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: The p-persistent CSMA protocol is central to random-access MAC analysis, but
predicting saturation throughput in heterogeneous multi-hop wireless networks
remains a hard problem. Simplified models that assume a single, shared
interference domain can underestimate throughput by 48--62\% in sparse
topologies. Exact Markov-chain analyses are accurate but scale exponentially in
computation time, making them impractical for large networks. These
computational barriers motivate structural machine learning approaches like
GNNs for scalable throughput prediction in general network topologies. Yet
off-the-shelf GNNs struggle here: a standard GCN yields 63.94\% normalized mean
absolute error (NMAE) on heterogeneous networks because symmetric normalization
conflates a node's direct interference with higher-order, cascading effects
that pertain to how interference propagates over the network graph.
  Building on these insights, we propose the Decoupled Graph Convolutional
Network (D-GCN), a novel architecture that explicitly separates processing of a
node's own transmission probability from neighbor interference effects. D-GCN
replaces mean aggregation with learnable attention, yielding interpretable,
per-neighbor contribution weights while capturing complex multihop interference
patterns. D-GCN attains 3.3\% NMAE, outperforms strong baselines, remains
tractable even when exact analytical methods become computationally infeasible,
and enables gradient-based network optimization that achieves within 1\% of
theoretical optima.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出ProtGram-DirectGCN框架，通过层次化n-gram图和定向图卷积网络进行蛋白质-蛋白质相互作用预测，在计算成本较低的情况下实现稳健预测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有蛋白质-蛋白质相互作用预测方法计算成本高，需要探索更高效的替代方案，特别是利用蛋白质语言模型的序列嵌入和3D结构的图神经网络方法之外的轻量级方法。

Method: 采用两阶段图表示学习框架：1) ProtGram将蛋白质一级结构建模为层次化n-gram图，边权重由残基转移概率定义；2) DirectGCN定向图卷积网络，通过路径特定变换和可学习门控机制处理信息。

Result: DirectGCN在标准节点分类基准测试中表现优异，与现有方法相当，特别擅长处理复杂定向图和密集异质结构。ProtGram-DirectGCN框架在PPI预测中展现出强大预测能力，即使在有限训练数据下也能保持稳健性能。

Conclusion: ProtGram-DirectGCN框架为蛋白质-蛋白质相互作用预测提供了一种计算效率高且性能优异的替代方案，特别适用于复杂定向图结构和数据有限的情况。

Abstract: Introduction Accurate prediction of protein-protein interactions (PPIs) is
crucial for understanding cellular functions and advancing drug development.
Existing in-silico methods use direct sequence embeddings from Protein Language
Models (PLMs). Others use Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for 3D protein
structures. This study explores less computationally intensive alternatives. We
introduce a novel framework for downstream PPI prediction through link
prediction. Methods We introduce a two-stage graph representation learning
framework, ProtGram-DirectGCN. First, we developed ProtGram. This approach
models a protein's primary structure as a hierarchy of globally inferred n-gram
graphs. In these graphs, residue transition probabilities define edge weights.
Each edge connects a pair of residues in a directed graph. The probabilities
are aggregated from a large corpus of sequences. Second, we propose DirectGCN,
a custom directed graph convolutional neural network. This model features a
unique convolutional layer. It processes information through separate
path-specific transformations: incoming, outgoing, and undirected. A shared
transformation is also applied. These paths are combined via a learnable gating
mechanism. We apply DirectGCN to ProtGram graphs to learn residue-level
embeddings. These embeddings are pooled via attention to generate protein-level
embeddings for prediction. Results We first established the efficacy of
DirectGCN on standard node classification benchmarks. Its performance matches
established methods on general datasets. The model excels at complex, directed
graphs with dense, heterophilic structures. When applied to PPI prediction, the
full ProtGram-DirectGCN framework delivers robust predictive power. This strong
performance holds even with limited training data.

Motivation: 量化交易策略依赖准确的股票排序来识别盈利投资。虽然Transformer模型在理解金融时间序列方面很有前景，但不同训练损失函数如何影响其股票排序能力尚未被充分理解。标准损失函数追求简单预测精度，但无法直接教导模型学习正确的股票收益排序。

Conclusion: 损失函数的选择对Transformer模型在股票排序任务中的表现有显著影响。成对排序损失函数特别适合金融收益排序任务，为优化基于排名的交易策略提供了实用指导。

Abstract: Quantitative trading strategies rely on accurately ranking stocks to identify
profitable investments. Effective portfolio management requires models that can
reliably order future stock returns. Transformer models are promising for
understanding financial time series, but how different training loss functions
affect their ability to rank stocks well is not yet fully understood. Financial
markets are challenging due to their changing nature and complex relationships
between stocks. Standard loss functions, which aim for simple prediction
accuracy, often aren't enough. They don't directly teach models to learn the
correct order of stock returns. While many advanced ranking losses exist from
fields such as information retrieval, there hasn't been a thorough comparison
to see how well they work for ranking financial returns, especially when used
with modern Transformer models for stock selection. This paper addresses this
gap by systematically evaluating a diverse set of advanced loss functions
including pointwise, pairwise, listwise for daily stock return forecasting to
facilitate rank-based portfolio selection on S&P 500 data. We focus on
assessing how each loss function influences the model's ability to discern
profitable relative orderings among assets. Our research contributes a
comprehensive benchmark revealing how different loss functions impact a model's
ability to learn cross-sectional and temporal patterns crucial for portfolio
selection, thereby offering practical guidance for optimizing ranking-based
trading strategies.

enhanced interpretability and actionable intelligence. We advocate for the
adoption of tensor-based characterization, promising a leap forward in
understanding complex datasets and paving the way for intelligent, explainable

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统模型合并方法在应用于低秩权重时会导致严重的性能下降，需要一种新方法来保持压缩模型的性能。

Method: 提出可逆模型合并方法，构建紧凑基空间，通过线性组合恢复原始任务特定模型，提供闭式解选择最优基权重和任务特定系数。

Result: 在多个数据集和模型规模上的实验表明，RMM显著优于现有合并方法，大幅保留了低秩压缩模型的性能。

Conclusion: 模型合并应视为生成可重构模型空间而非单一合并模型，可逆方法能有效解决低秩模型合并的性能问题。

Abstract: Model merging aims to combine multiple fine-tuned models into a single set of
weights that performs well across all source tasks. While prior work has shown
that merging can approximate the performance of individual fine-tuned models
for each task, it largely overlooks scenarios where models are compressed into
low-rank representations, either through low-rank adaptation (LoRA) or
post-training singular value decomposition (SVD). We first demonstrate that
applying conventional merging methods to low-rank weights leads to severe
performance degradation in the merged model. Motivated by this phenomenon, we
propose a fundamentally different approach: instead of collapsing all adapters
into one set of weights, we construct a compact basis (e.g., an equivalent of
holding two or more models) from which original task-specific models can be
recovered via linear combination. This reframes merging as generating a
reconstruction-capable model space rather than producing a single merged model.
Crucially, this allows us to ``revert'' to each individual model when needed,
recognizing that no merged model can consistently outperform one specialized
for its task. Building on this insight, we introduce our method, Reversible
Model Merging (RMM), an efficient, data-free, and flexible method that provides
a closed-form solution for selecting the optimal basis of model weights and
task-specific coefficients for linear combination. Extensive experiments across
diverse datasets and model scales demonstrate that RMM consistently outperforms
existing merging approaches, preserving the performance of low-rank compressed
models by a significant margin.

Result: 实验表明OCNOpt在鲁棒性和效率方面优于现有方法，同时保持可管理的计算复杂度，支持层间反馈策略、博弈论应用和连续时间模型的高阶训练。

Conclusion: OCNOpt为基于动态系统和最优控制理论的原则性算法设计开辟了新途径，证明了将最优控制理论应用于神经网络优化的有效性。

Abstract: Optimization of deep neural networks (DNNs) has been a driving force in the
advancement of modern machine learning and artificial intelligence. With DNNs
characterized by a prolonged sequence of nonlinear propagation, determining
their optimal parameters given an objective naturally fits within the framework
of Optimal Control Programming. Such an interpretation of DNNs as dynamical
systems has proven crucial in offering a theoretical foundation for principled
analysis from numerical equations to physics. In parallel to these theoretical
pursuits, this paper focuses on an algorithmic perspective. Our motivated
observation is the striking algorithmic resemblance between the Backpropagation
algorithm for computing gradients in DNNs and the optimality conditions for
dynamical systems, expressed through another backward process known as dynamic
programming. Consolidating this connection, where Backpropagation admits a
variational structure, solving an approximate dynamic programming up to the
first-order expansion leads to a new class of optimization methods exploring
higher-order expansions of the Bellman equation. The resulting optimizer,
termed Optimal Control Theoretic Neural Optimizer (OCNOpt), enables rich
algorithmic opportunities, including layer-wise feedback policies,
game-theoretic applications, and higher-order training of continuous-time
models such as Neural ODEs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that OCNOpt
improves upon existing methods in robustness and efficiency while maintaining
manageable computational complexity, paving new avenues for principled
algorithmic design grounded in dynamical systems and optimal control theory.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MAFA是一个生产部署的多智能体标注框架，通过可配置的多智能体协作解决金融服务中的大规模标注积压问题，在摩根大通成功处理了100万条客户话语积压，平均与人工标注者达成86%一致，每年节省5000多小时人工标注工作。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决金融服务中数百万客户话语需要准确分类的标注积压关键挑战，传统标注方法效率低下且成本高昂。

Method: 结合专门化智能体与结构化推理，采用基于评判者的共识机制，支持通过配置而非代码修改来定义自定义标注类型，实现动态任务适应。

Result: 消除了100万条话语积压，平均与人工标注者达成86%一致，标注置信度分类显示85%高置信度、10%中等、5%低置信度，在内部意图分类数据集上比传统方法Top-1准确率提高13.8%，Top-5准确率提高15.1%，F1分数提高16.9%。

Conclusion: MAFA弥合了理论多智能体系统与实际企业部署之间的差距，为面临类似标注挑战的组织提供了蓝图，证明了多智能体协作在生产环境中的有效性。

Abstract: We present MAFA (Multi-Agent Framework for Annotation), a production-deployed
system that transforms enterprise-scale annotation workflows through
configurable multi-agent collaboration. Addressing the critical challenge of
annotation backlogs in financial services, where millions of customer
utterances require accurate categorization, MAFA combines specialized agents
with structured reasoning and a judge-based consensus mechanism. Our framework
uniquely supports dynamic task adaptation, allowing organizations to define
custom annotation types (FAQs, intents, entities, or domain-specific
categories) through configuration rather than code changes. Deployed at JP
Morgan Chase, MAFA has eliminated a 1 million utterance backlog while
achieving, on average, 86% agreement with human annotators, annually saving
over 5,000 hours of manual annotation work. The system processes utterances
with annotation confidence classifications, which are typically 85% high, 10%
medium, and 5% low across all datasets we tested. This enables human annotators
to focus exclusively on ambiguous and low-coverage cases. We demonstrate MAFA's
effectiveness across multiple datasets and languages, showing consistent
improvements over traditional and single-agent annotation baselines: 13.8%
higher Top-1 accuracy, 15.1% improvement in Top-5 accuracy, and 16.9% better F1
in our internal intent classification dataset and similar gains on public
benchmarks. This work bridges the gap between theoretical multi-agent systems
and practical enterprise deployment, providing a blueprint for organizations
facing similar annotation challenges.

Motivation: 扩散模型擅长生成，但其潜在空间未明确组织以实现可解释控制。需要将潜在几何与系统动态对齐。

Result: 在流体动力学、神经钙成像、神经刺激治疗和面部表情等基准测试中，ConDA产生可解释的潜在表示，相比线性遍历和基于条件的方法具有更好的可控性。

Conclusion: 扩散潜在编码包含动态相关结构，但利用此结构需要潜在组织并沿潜在流形进行遍历。

Abstract: Diffusion models excel at generation, but their latent spaces are not
explicitly organized for interpretable control. We introduce ConDA (Contrastive
Diffusion Alignment), a framework that applies contrastive learning within
diffusion embeddings to align latent geometry with system dynamics. Motivated
by recent advances showing that contrastive objectives can recover more
disentangled and structured representations, ConDA organizes diffusion latents
such that traversal directions reflect underlying dynamical factors. Within
this contrastively structured space, ConDA enables nonlinear trajectory
traversal that supports faithful interpolation, extrapolation, and controllable
generation. Across benchmarks in fluid dynamics, neural calcium imaging,
therapeutic neurostimulation, and facial expression, ConDA produces
interpretable latent representations with improved controllability compared to
linear traversals and conditioning-based baselines. These results suggest that
diffusion latents encode dynamics-relevant structure, but exploiting this
structure requires latent organization and traversal along the latent manifold.

TL;DR: 对分子核函数进行首次全面光谱分析，发现更丰富的光谱特征并不总是提高预测精度，在某些情况下甚至与性能负相关。领先特征值（前2%）即可恢复大部分性能，挑战了"更丰富光谱带来更好泛化"的常见启发式观点。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然深度模型在分子性质预测中达到最先进精度，但核方法因其在低数据环境中的鲁棒性和透明理论基础仍被广泛使用。尽管机器学习中已有大量核光谱研究，但对分子核的系统光谱分析却很稀缺。

Method: 在QM9数据集上对分子指纹、预训练transformer、全局和局部3D表示等七种分子性质进行核岭回归的全面光谱分析，使用四种不同光谱指标，并实现截断核来探究光谱与预测性能的关系。

Result: 更丰富的光谱特征并不一致提高准确性。对于transformer和局部3D表示，光谱丰富度甚至与性能呈负相关。在许多核中，仅保留前2%特征值即可恢复几乎所有性能。

Conclusion: 研究结果挑战了"更丰富光谱带来更好泛化"的常见启发式观点，揭示了表示、核特征与预测性能之间的微妙关系，为数据受限的科学和实际任务中核与自监督学习方法的评估提供了重要见解。

Abstract: Understanding the spectral properties of kernels offers a principled
perspective on generalization and representation quality. While deep models
achieve state-of-the-art accuracy in molecular property prediction, kernel
methods remain widely used for their robustness in low-data regimes and
transparent theoretical grounding. Despite extensive studies of kernel spectra
in machine learning, systematic spectral analyses of molecular kernels are
scarce. In this work, we provide the first comprehensive spectral analysis of
kernel ridge regression on the QM9 dataset, molecular fingerprint, pretrained
transformer-based, global and local 3D representations across seven molecular
properties. Surprisingly, richer spectral features, measured by four different
spectral metrics, do not consistently improve accuracy. Pearson correlation
tests further reveal that for transformer-based and local 3D representations,
spectral richness can even have a negative correlation with performance. We
also implement truncated kernels to probe the relationship between spectrum and
predictive performance: in many kernels, retaining only the top 2% of
eigenvalues recovers nearly all performance, indicating that the leading
eigenvalues capture the most informative features. Our results challenge the
common heuristic that "richer spectra yield better generalization" and
highlight nuanced relationships between representation, kernel features, and
predictive performance. Beyond molecular property prediction, these findings
inform how kernel and self-supervised learning methods are evaluated in
data-limited scientific and real-world tasks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文揭示了平坦最小值与对抗鲁棒性的复杂关系：平坦性仅能保证局部鲁棒性，而非全局鲁棒性。研究发现对抗样本常位于模型自信但错误的平坦区域。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管神经网络经验上成功，但仍易受微小对抗扰动攻击。长期假设认为平坦最小值能提供更好的鲁棒性，但这种联系缺乏严格形式化。

Method: 首先推导了倒数第二层相对平坦度的闭式表达式，利用此约束损失在输入空间的变化，从而形式化分析整个网络的对抗鲁棒性。

Result: 平坦性仅能保证局部鲁棒性，要维持超出局部邻域的鲁棒性，损失需要在数据流形外急剧弯曲。经验验证显示对抗样本常位于模型自信错误的平坦区域。

Conclusion: 研究挑战了对平坦性的简化理解，提供了关于其在鲁棒性中作用的细致理解：平坦性仅提供局部保护，全局鲁棒性需要不同的几何结构。

Abstract: Despite their empirical success, neural networks remain vulnerable to small,
adversarial perturbations. A longstanding hypothesis suggests that flat minima,
regions of low curvature in the loss landscape, offer increased robustness.
While intuitive, this connection has remained largely informal and incomplete.
By rigorously formalizing the relationship, we show this intuition is only
partially correct: flatness implies local but not global adversarial
robustness. To arrive at this result, we first derive a closed-form expression
for relative flatness in the penultimate layer, and then show we can use this
to constrain the variation of the loss in input space. This allows us to
formally analyze the adversarial robustness of the entire network. We then show
that to maintain robustness beyond a local neighborhood, the loss needs to
curve sharply away from the data manifold. We validate our theoretical
predictions empirically across architectures and datasets, uncovering the
geometric structure that governs adversarial vulnerability, and linking
flatness to model confidence: adversarial examples often lie in large, flat
regions where the model is confidently wrong. Our results challenge simplified
views of flatness and provide a nuanced understanding of its role in
robustness.

Abstract: Competitive programming has become a rigorous benchmark for evaluating the
reasoning and problem-solving capabilities of large language models (LLMs). The
International Olympiad in Informatics (IOI) stands out as one of the most
prestigious annual competitions in competitive programming and has become a key
benchmark for comparing human and AI-level programming ability. While several
proprietary models have been claimed to achieve gold medal-level performance at
the IOI, often with undisclosed methods, achieving comparable results with
open-weight models remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we present
\gencluster, a scalable and reproducible test-time compute framework that
attains IOI gold-level performance using open-weight models. It combines
large-scale generation, behavioral clustering, ranking, and a round-robin
submission strategy to efficiently explore diverse solution spaces under
limited validation budgets. Our experiments show that the performance of our
proposed approach scales consistently with available compute, narrowing the gap
between open and closed systems. Notably, we will show that GenCluster can
achieve a gold medal at IOI 2025 for the first time with an open-weight model
gpt-oss-120b, setting a new benchmark for transparent and reproducible
evaluation of reasoning in LLMs.

Abstract: Decision-making under distribution shift is a central challenge in
reinforcement learning (RL), where training and deployment environments differ.
We study this problem through the lens of robust Markov decision processes
(RMDPs), which optimize performance against adversarial transition dynamics.
Our focus is the online setting, where the agent has only limited interaction
with the environment, making sample efficiency and exploration especially
critical. Policy optimization, despite its success in standard RL, remains
theoretically and empirically underexplored in robust RL. To bridge this gap,
we propose \textbf{D}istributionally \textbf{R}obust \textbf{R}egularized
\textbf{P}olicy \textbf{O}ptimization algorithm (DR-RPO), a model-free online
policy optimization method that learns robust policies with sublinear regret.
To enable tractable optimization within the softmax policy class, DR-RPO
incorporates reference-policy regularization, yielding RMDP variants that are
doubly constrained in both transitions and policies. To scale to large
state-action spaces, we adopt the $d$-rectangular linear MDP formulation and
combine linear function approximation with an upper confidence bonus for
optimistic exploration. We provide theoretical guarantees showing that policy
optimization can achieve polynomial suboptimality bounds and sample efficiency
in robust RL, matching the performance of value-based approaches. Finally,
empirical results across diverse domains corroborate our theory and demonstrate
the robustness of DR-RPO.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出PhysAttnNet模型，通过物理先验引导的双流注意力网络改进弹性布拉格防波堤运动响应预测，解决了传统深度学习模型在未见海况下泛化能力不足的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统深度学习模型在预测弹性布拉格防波堤运动响应时，对未见海况的泛化能力有限，主要原因是忽略了海洋系统的自然衰减现象和波-结构相互作用的充分建模。

Method: 提出PhysAttnNet模型，包含衰减双向自注意力模块（模拟自然衰减）、相位差引导双向交叉注意力模块（捕捉波-结构相互作用），通过全局上下文融合模块整合，并采用混合时频损失函数训练。

Result: 在波浪水槽数据集上的实验表明，PhysAttnNet显著优于主流模型，跨场景泛化测试验证了模型对未见环境的鲁棒性和适应性。

Conclusion: PhysAttnNet为海洋工程中复杂系统的预测模型开发提供了一个有前景的框架，具有出色的泛化能力和实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Accurate motion response prediction for elastic Bragg breakwaters is critical
for their structural safety and operational integrity in marine environments.
However, conventional deep learning models often exhibit limited generalization
capabilities when presented with unseen sea states. These deficiencies stem
from the neglect of natural decay observed in marine systems and inadequate
modeling of wave-structure interaction (WSI). To overcome these challenges,
this study proposes a novel Physics Prior-Guided Dual-Stream Attention Network
(PhysAttnNet). First, the decay bidirectional self-attention (DBSA) module
incorporates a learnable temporal decay to assign higher weights to recent
states, aiming to emulate the natural decay phenomenon. Meanwhile, the phase
differences guided bidirectional cross-attention (PDG-BCA) module explicitly
captures the bidirectional interaction and phase relationship between waves and
the structure using a cosine-based bias within a bidirectional
cross-computation paradigm. These streams are synergistically integrated
through a global context fusion (GCF) module. Finally, PhysAttnNet is trained
with a hybrid time-frequency loss that jointly minimizes time-domain prediction
errors and frequency-domain spectral discrepancies. Comprehensive experiments
on wave flume datasets demonstrate that PhysAttnNet significantly outperforms
mainstream models. Furthermore,cross-scenario generalization tests validate the
model's robustness and adaptability to unseen environments, highlighting its
potential as a framework to develop predictive models for complex systems in
ocean engineering.

TL;DR: 本文通过51个任务全面比较了通用型和专用型时间序列基础模型在PPG信号分析中的表现，发现专用模型在完全微调场景下胜率高出27%


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着基础模型在时间序列分析中应用增多，特别是生理信号领域，需要系统比较通用型与专用型模型的性能差异，重点关注PPG信号

Method: 使用51个任务评估模型，涵盖心脏状态评估、实验室值估计和跨模态推理，从7个维度（胜率、平均性能、特征质量等）进行综合比较

Result: 在完全微调场景下，专用模型胜率比通用模型高出27%，在多个维度表现更优

Conclusion: 专用模型在PPG信号分析任务中表现更佳，研究还分析了泛化性、公平性、注意力可视化及训练数据选择的重要性

Abstract: Foundation models are large-scale machine learning models that are
pre-trained on massive amounts of data and can be adapted for various
downstream tasks. They have been extensively applied to tasks in Natural
Language Processing and Computer Vision with models such as GPT, BERT, and
CLIP. They are now also increasingly gaining attention in time-series analysis,
particularly for physiological sensing. However, most time series foundation
models are specialist models - with data in pre-training and testing of the
same type, such as Electrocardiogram, Electroencephalogram, and
Photoplethysmogram (PPG). Recent works, such as MOMENT, train a generalist time
series foundation model with data from multiple domains, such as weather,
traffic, and electricity. This paper aims to conduct a comprehensive
benchmarking study to compare the performance of generalist and specialist
models, with a focus on PPG signals. Through an extensive suite of total 51
tasks covering cardiac state assessment, laboratory value estimation, and
cross-modal inference, we comprehensively evaluate both models across seven
dimensions, including win score, average performance, feature quality, tuning
gain, performance variance, transferability, and scalability. These metrics
jointly capture not only the models' capability but also their adaptability,
robustness, and efficiency under different fine-tuning strategies, providing a
holistic understanding of their strengths and limitations for diverse
downstream scenarios. In a full-tuning scenario, we demonstrate that the
specialist model achieves a 27% higher win score. Finally, we provide further
analysis on generalization, fairness, attention visualizations, and the
importance of training data choice.

TL;DR: CAST是一个无需探针的框架，通过直接估计变换矩阵和频谱分析来理解Transformer层的功能，为现有可解释性方法提供补充视角。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型虽然成功但仍是黑盒，现有可解释性方法各有局限，需要新的视角来理解模型内部机制。

Method: 使用Moore-Penrose伪逆估计每层的实际变换矩阵，应用包含六个可解释指标的频谱分析，并进行核分析。

Result: 发现编码器和解码器模型行为差异：解码器呈现压缩-扩展循环，编码器保持一致的高秩处理；核相似性矩阵将层划分为特征提取、压缩和专业化三个阶段。

Conclusion: CAST提供了理解Transformer层功能的新视角，揭示了不同模型架构的独特行为模式，为模型可解释性研究贡献了有价值的工具。

Abstract: Large language models have achieved remarkable success but remain largely
black boxes with poorly understood internal mechanisms. To address this
limitation, many researchers have proposed various interpretability methods
including mechanistic analysis, probing classifiers, and activation
visualization, each providing valuable insights from different perspectives.
Building upon this rich landscape of complementary approaches, we introduce
CAST (Compositional Analysis via Spectral Tracking), a probe-free framework
that contributes a novel perspective by analyzing transformer layer functions
through direct transformation matrix estimation and comprehensive spectral
analysis. CAST offers complementary insights to existing methods by estimating
the realized transformation matrices for each layer using Moore-Penrose
pseudoinverse and applying spectral analysis with six interpretable metrics
characterizing layer behavior. Our analysis reveals distinct behaviors between
encoder-only and decoder-only models, with decoder models exhibiting
compression-expansion cycles while encoder models maintain consistent high-rank
processing. Kernel analysis further demonstrates functional relationship
patterns between layers, with CKA similarity matrices clearly partitioning
layers into three phases: feature extraction, compression, and specialization.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于数据非参数化的扩散模型归因方法，通过图像块级相似度衡量训练数据对生成输出的影响，无需模型梯度或重训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有扩散模型归因方法通常需要模型梯度或重训练，限制了在专有或大规模设置中的适用性，需要一种完全基于数据的归因方法。

Method: 基于最优得分函数的解析形式，通过图像块级相似度测量生成图像与训练图像之间的影响，支持多尺度表示，并通过基于卷积的加速保持计算效率。

Result: 实验表明该方法实现了强大的归因性能，与基于梯度的方法接近，并显著优于现有的非参数基线方法。

Conclusion: 该方法不仅产生空间可解释的归因结果，还揭示了训练数据与输出之间的内在关系，且独立于任何特定模型。

Abstract: Data attribution for generative models seeks to quantify the influence of
individual training examples on model outputs. Existing methods for diffusion
models typically require access to model gradients or retraining, limiting
their applicability in proprietary or large-scale settings. We propose a
nonparametric attribution method that operates entirely on data, measuring
influence via patch-level similarity between generated and training images. Our
approach is grounded in the analytical form of the optimal score function and
naturally extends to multiscale representations, while remaining
computationally efficient through convolution-based acceleration. In addition
to producing spatially interpretable attributions, our framework uncovers
patterns that reflect intrinsic relationships between training data and
outputs, independent of any specific model. Experiments demonstrate that our
method achieves strong attribution performance, closely matching gradient-based
approaches and substantially outperforming existing nonparametric baselines.

TL;DR: CAREBench是一个早期事件预测基准，评估多模态输入下的预测准确性和时间稳定性，发现现有方法难以同时优化这两个指标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前早期事件预测系统忽略风险评分稳定性，且主要评估表格输入，缺乏对风险轨迹行为的测试。

Method: 提出CAREBench基准，使用多模态输入（表格EHR、ECG波形、临床文本），引入基于局部Lipschitz常数的稳定性指标来量化短期风险变异性。

Result: 现有方法（特别是LLMs）在准确性和稳定性联合优化上表现不佳，在高精度操作点召回率较差。

Conclusion: 需要开发能产生证据对齐、稳定轨迹的模型，以赢得临床医生在连续监测环境中的信任。

Abstract: Early event prediction (EEP) systems continuously estimate a patient's
imminent risk to support clinical decision-making. For bedside trust, risk
trajectories must be accurate and temporally stable, shifting only with new,
relevant evidence. However, current benchmarks (a) ignore stability of risk
scores and (b) evaluate mainly on tabular inputs, leaving trajectory behavior
untested. To address this gap, we introduce CAREBench, an EEP benchmark that
evaluates deployability using multi-modal inputs-tabular EHR, ECG waveforms,
and clinical text-and assesses temporal stability alongside predictive
accuracy. We propose a stability metric that quantifies short-term variability
in per-patient risk and penalizes abrupt oscillations based on local-Lipschitz
constants. CAREBench spans six prediction tasks such as sepsis onset and
compares classical learners, deep sequence models, and zero-shot LLMs. Across
tasks, existing methods, especially LLMs, struggle to jointly optimize accuracy
and stability, with notably poor recall at high-precision operating points.
These results highlight the need for models that produce evidence-aligned,
stable trajectories to earn clinician trust in continuous monitoring settings.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了谱残差储层计算（SR-RC）方法，将无学习的谱残差注意力机制与储层计算结合，在保持学习效率的同时提升时间序列异常检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 储层计算在边缘AI应用中具有优势，但单独使用时需要过大的储层才能达到足够的异常检测性能，而传统注意力机制会损害学习效率。

Method: 将谱残差方法（一种无学习的自底向上注意力机制）与储层计算集成，形成SR-RC模型。

Result: 在基准任务和真实世界时间序列数据集上，SR-RC优于传统RC和基于谱残差特征提取的逻辑回归模型。

Conclusion: SR-RC为在边缘AI中部署储层计算进行时间序列异常检测提供了实用方向，因为谱残差方法与RC都适合硬件实现。

Abstract: Reservoir computing (RC) establishes the basis for the processing of
time-series data by exploiting the high-dimensional spatiotemporal response of
a recurrent neural network to an input signal. In particular, RC trains only
the output layer weights. This simplicity has drawn attention especially in
Edge Artificial Intelligence (AI) applications. Edge AI enables time-series
anomaly detection in real time, which is important because detection delays can
lead to serious incidents. However, achieving adequate anomaly-detection
performance with RC alone may require an unacceptably large reservoir on
resource-constrained edge devices. Without enlarging the reservoir, attention
mechanisms can improve accuracy, although they may require substantial
computation and undermine the learning efficiency of RC. In this study, to
improve the anomaly detection performance of RC without sacrificing learning
efficiency, we propose a spectral residual RC (SR-RC) that integrates the
spectral residual (SR) method - a learning-free, bottom-up attention mechanism
- with RC. We demonstrated that SR-RC outperformed conventional RC and
logistic-regression models based on values extracted by the SR method across
benchmark tasks and real-world time-series datasets. Moreover, because the SR
method, similarly to RC, is well suited for hardware implementation, SR-RC
suggests a practical direction for deploying RC as Edge AI for time-series
anomaly detection.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TED++是一个子流形感知的框架，通过构建围绕每个类隐藏特征流形的管状邻域，利用局部自适应排序检测偏离可接受管道的激活，有效识别逃避现有防御的隐蔽后门攻击。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着深度神经网络在关键应用中广泛使用，隐蔽的后门攻击（中毒训练输入触发恶意模型行为但看起来良性）构成严重安全风险。现有防御在面对攻击者利用微妙距离异常或干净样本稀缺时存在漏洞。

Method: TED++首先围绕每个类的隐藏特征流形构建管状邻域，从少量干净激活估计局部"厚度"。然后应用局部自适应排序检测任何偏离可接受管道的激活。通过在所有层聚合这些LAR调整的排名，捕获输入在演化类子流形上的忠实程度。

Result: 在基准数据集和任务上的广泛实验表明，TED++在自适应攻击和有限数据场景下均实现了最先进的检测性能。即使每类只有5个保留样本，TED++仍能实现近乎完美的检测，在AUROC上比次优方法提升高达14%。

Conclusion: TED++通过表征"管道约束"行为，能够有效识别LAR排名序列显著偏离的输入，为防御隐蔽后门攻击提供了强大解决方案。

Abstract: As deep neural networks power increasingly critical applications, stealthy
backdoor attacks, where poisoned training inputs trigger malicious model
behaviour while appearing benign, pose a severe security risk. Many existing
defences are vulnerable when attackers exploit subtle distance-based anomalies
or when clean examples are scarce. To meet this challenge, we introduce TED++,
a submanifold-aware framework that effectively detects subtle backdoors that
evade existing defences. TED++ begins by constructing a tubular neighbourhood
around each class's hidden-feature manifold, estimating its local ``thickness''
from a handful of clean activations. It then applies Locally Adaptive Ranking
(LAR) to detect any activation that drifts outside the admissible tube. By
aggregating these LAR-adjusted ranks across all layers, TED++ captures how
faithfully an input remains on the evolving class submanifolds. Based on such
characteristic ``tube-constrained'' behaviour, TED++ flags inputs whose
LAR-based ranking sequences deviate significantly. Extensive experiments are
conducted on benchmark datasets and tasks, demonstrating that TED++ achieves
state-of-the-art detection performance under both adaptive-attack and
limited-data scenarios. Remarkably, even with only five held-out examples per
class, TED++ still delivers near-perfect detection, achieving gains of up to
14\% in AUROC over the next-best method. The code is publicly available at
https://github.com/namle-w/TEDpp.

TL;DR: 提出了主动可观测马尔可夫决策过程(AOMDP)，智能体不仅选择控制动作，还决定是否测量潜在状态。测量会揭示真实状态但可能有负面延迟影响。研究表明减少不确定性可提高样本效率和最优策略价值。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在强化学习中测量状态可能成本高昂且对后续结果产生负面影响，需要平衡状态观测与控制决策的关系。

Method: 将AOMDP建模为周期性部分可观测MDP，提出基于信念状态的在线RL算法，使用序列蒙特卡洛方法联合近似未知静态环境参数和未观测潜在状态的后验分布。

Result: 在数字健康应用中评估算法，智能体决定何时提供数字干预和何时通过调查评估用户健康状态。

Conclusion: 主动观测策略能够有效平衡状态测量成本与不确定性减少带来的收益，在真实应用中具有实用价值。

Abstract: Measuring states in reinforcement learning (RL) can be costly in real-world
settings and may negatively influence future outcomes. We introduce the
Actively Observable Markov Decision Process (AOMDP), where an agent not only
selects control actions but also decides whether to measure the latent state.
The measurement action reveals the true latent state but may have a negative
delayed effect on the environment. We show that this reduced uncertainty may
provably improve sample efficiency and increase the value of the optimal policy
despite these costs. We formulate an AOMDP as a periodic partially observable
MDP and propose an online RL algorithm based on belief states. To approximate
the belief states, we further propose a sequential Monte Carlo method to
jointly approximate the posterior of unknown static environment parameters and
unobserved latent states. We evaluate the proposed algorithm in a digital
health application, where the agent decides when to deliver digital
interventions and when to assess users' health status through surveys.

TL;DR: LLM-ERM：一种结合LLM引导搜索和经验风险最小化的程序学习框架，在样本效率和计算可行性上优于传统方法


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决程序学习中样本效率和计算可行性的平衡问题。传统方法要么搜索成本高（枚举法），要么样本需求大（梯度训练法）

Method: 提出LLM-ERM框架：使用预训练LLM生成候选程序，在验证集上编译检查，选择最佳假设，无需反馈、自适应或梯度

Result: LLM-ERM仅需200个样本即可解决奇偶校验、模式匹配、素数测试等任务，而SGD训练的Transformer在10万样本下仍过拟合

Conclusion: 语言引导的程序合成在保持计算可行性的同时恢复了有限类ERM的统计效率，为学习简洁假设提供了实用路径

Abstract: We seek algorithms for program learning that are both sample-efficient and
computationally feasible. Classical results show that targets admitting short
program descriptions (e.g., with short ``python code'') can be learned with a
``small'' number of examples (scaling with the size of the code) via
length-first program enumeration, but the search is exponential in description
length. Consequently, Gradient-based training avoids this cost yet can require
exponentially many samples on certain short-program families.
  To address this gap, we introduce LLM-ERM, a propose-and-verify framework
that replaces exhaustive enumeration with an LLM-guided search over candidate
programs while retaining ERM-style selection on held-out data. Specifically, we
draw $k$ candidates with a pretrained reasoning-augmented LLM, compile and
check each on the data, and return the best verified hypothesis, with no
feedback, adaptivity, or gradients. Theoretically, we show that coordinate-wise
online mini-batch SGD requires many samples to learn certain short programs.
{\em Empirically, LLM-ERM solves tasks such as parity variants, pattern
matching, and primality testing with as few as 200 samples, while SGD-trained
transformers overfit even with 100,000 samples}. These results indicate that
language-guided program synthesis recovers much of the statistical efficiency
of finite-class ERM while remaining computationally tractable, offering a
practical route to learning succinct hypotheses beyond the reach of
gradient-based training.

TL;DR: 本文提出DARTS-GT，一种通过可微分架构搜索实现深度异构的图Transformer，同时开发了首个图Transformer的量化可解释性框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前图Transformer存在设计僵化、缺乏量化可解释性的问题，固定GNN类型无法充分利用深度特异性，复杂架构无法区分性能提升是来自有意义模式还是虚假相关。

Method: 通过非对称注意力设计，将结构编码与特征表示解耦：查询来自节点特征，键值来自GNN变换。在框架内使用DARTS为每层选择最优GNN算子，实现Transformer注意力内部的深度异构。

Result: 在8个基准测试中，DARTS-GT在4个数据集上达到最先进水平，其他数据集保持竞争力。发现架构揭示数据集特定模式，异构架构产生更可解释的模型。

Conclusion: 图Transformer无需在性能和可解释性之间做选择，视觉注意力显著性与因果重要性并不总是相关，可视化方法可能遗漏真正重要的组件。

Abstract: Graph Transformers (GTs) have emerged as powerful architectures for
graph-structured data, yet remain constrained by rigid designs and lack
quantifiable interpretability. Current state-of-the-art GTs commit to fixed GNN
types across all layers, missing potential benefits of depth-specific component
selection, while their complex architectures become opaque where performance
gains cannot be distinguished between meaningful patterns and spurious
correlations. We redesign GT attention through asymmetry, decoupling structural
encoding from feature representation: queries derive from node features while
keys and values come from GNN transformations. Within this framework, we use
Differentiable ARchiTecture Search (DARTS) to select optimal GNN operators at
each layer, enabling depth-wise heterogeneity inside transformer attention
itself (DARTS-GT). To understand discovered architectures, we develop the first
quantitative interpretability framework for GTs through causal ablation. Our
metrics (Head-deviation, Specialization, and Focus), identify which heads and
nodes drive predictions while enabling model comparison. Experiments across
eight benchmarks show DARTS-GT achieves state-of-the-art on four datasets while
remaining competitive on others, with discovered architectures revealing
dataset-specific patterns. Our interpretability analysis reveals that visual
attention salience and causal importance do not always correlate, indicating
widely used visualization approaches may miss components that actually matter.
Crucially, heterogeneous architectures found by DARTS-GT consistently produced
more interpretable models than baselines, establishing that Graph Transformers
need not choose between performance and interpretability.

TL;DR: 提出Stop-RAG方法，通过基于价值的控制器自适应决定何时停止检索，优化迭代RAG系统的效率和准确性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 迭代RAG系统每增加一次循环都会增加延迟、成本和引入干扰证据的风险，现有方法要么使用固定迭代次数，要么依赖不能准确反映是否需要更多检索的置信度代理

Method: 将迭代RAG建模为有限时域马尔可夫决策过程，使用基于价值的控制器，通过完整轨迹的全宽度前向视图Q(λ)目标进行训练

Result: 在多跳问答基准测试中，Stop-RAG始终优于固定迭代基线和基于提示的LLM停止方法

Conclusion: 自适应停止是当前代理系统中缺失的关键组件，基于价值的控制可以显著提高RAG系统的准确性

Abstract: Iterative retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) enables large language models
to answer complex multi-hop questions, but each additional loop increases
latency, costs, and the risk of introducing distracting evidence, motivating
the need for an efficient stopping strategy. Existing methods either use a
predetermined number of iterations or rely on confidence proxies that poorly
reflect whether more retrieval will actually help. We cast iterative RAG as a
finite-horizon Markov decision process and introduce Stop-RAG, a value-based
controller that adaptively decides when to stop retrieving. Trained with
full-width forward-view Q($\lambda$) targets from complete trajectories,
Stop-RAG learns effective stopping policies while remaining compatible with
black-box APIs and existing pipelines. On multi-hop question-answering
benchmarks, Stop-RAG consistently outperforms both fixed-iteration baselines
and prompting-based stopping with LLMs. These results highlight adaptive
stopping as a key missing component in current agentic systems, and demonstrate
that value-based control can improve the accuracy of RAG systems.

Motivation: 为自动微分理论提供几何基础，通过微分几何视角理解AD，为深度学习和科学计算中开发结构保持的微分方法奠定理论基础。

Method: 使用jet bundles和Weil代数的几何框架，将反向模式AD建模为余切拉回操作，泰勒模式作为Weil代数中的求值过程。

Result: 推导了反向模式的函子恒等式、高阶导数的代数精确性、截断误差的显式界，并证明张量化Weil代数可以单次计算所有混合导数，避免组合爆炸。

Conclusion: 该框架通过微分几何视角解释AD理论，为开发结构保持的微分方法提供了基础，在深度学习和科学计算中具有应用前景。

Abstract: We present a geometric formulation of automatic differentiation (AD) using
jet bundles and Weil algebras. Reverse-mode AD emerges as cotangent-pullback,
while Taylor-mode corresponds to evaluation in a Weil algebra. From these
principles, we derive concise statements on correctness, stability, and
complexity: a functorial identity for reverse-mode, algebraic exactness of
higher-order derivatives, and explicit bounds on truncation error. We further
show that tensorized Weil algebras permit one-pass computation of all mixed
derivatives with cost linear in the algebra dimension, avoiding the
combinatorial blow-up of nested JVP/VJP schedules. This framework interprets AD
theory through the lens of differential geometry and offers a foundation for
developing structure-preserving differentiation methods in deep learning and
scientific computing. Code and examples are available at

TL;DR: 本文首次系统分析了基于LLM的提示优化中的投毒风险，发现基于反馈的攻击比注入查询攻击更危险，提出了无需访问奖励模型的简单假奖励攻击，并设计了轻量级高亮防御方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM系统现在支撑着日常AI应用，性能通常依赖于精心设计的提示。基于LLM的提示优化器通过迭代优化减少这种努力，但优化阶段的安全性尚未得到充分研究。

Method: 使用HarmBench进行系统性分析，引入简单的假奖励攻击（无需访问奖励模型），并提出轻量级高亮防御方法。

Result: 发现系统对操纵反馈的脆弱性远高于注入查询：基于反馈的攻击使攻击成功率提升高达ΔASR=0.48。假奖励攻击将ΔASR从0.23提升到0.07，而防御方法在不降低效用的前提下将假奖励ΔASR从0.23降至0.07。

Conclusion: 这些结果表明提示优化管道是一类重要的攻击面，需要为反馈通道和优化框架提供更强的安全保障。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) systems now underpin everyday AI applications such
as chatbots, computer-use assistants, and autonomous robots, where performance
often depends on carefully designed prompts. LLM-based prompt optimizers reduce
that effort by iteratively refining prompts from scored feedback, yet the
security of this optimization stage remains underexamined. We present the first
systematic analysis of poisoning risks in LLM-based prompt optimization. Using
HarmBench, we find systems are substantially more vulnerable to manipulated
feedback than to injected queries: feedback-based attacks raise attack success
rate (ASR) by up to $\Delta$ASR = 0.48. We introduce a simple fake-reward
attack that requires no access to the reward model and significantly increases
vulnerability, and we propose a lightweight highlighting defense that reduces
the fake-reward $\Delta$ASR from 0.23 to 0.07 without degrading utility. These
results establish prompt optimization pipelines as a first-class attack surface
and motivate stronger safeguards for feedback channels and optimization
frameworks.

Similarly, state space models (SSMs) in varying designs have evolved as a
powerful alternative to transformers for target modeling in long sequences,
thereby overcoming the quadratic dependence on sequence length of a
transformer. Inspired by this progress, we here design SHaRe-SSM (Spiking
Harmonic Resonate and Fire State Space Model), for target variable modeling
(including both classification and regression) for very-long-range sequences.
Our second-order spiking SSM, on average, performs better than transformers or
first-order SSMs while circumventing multiplication operations, making it ideal
for resource-constrained applications. The proposed block consumes $73 \times$
less energy than second-order ANN-based SSMs for an 18k sequence, while
retaining performance. To ensure learnability over the long-range sequences, we
propose exploiting the stable and efficient implementation of the dynamical
system using parallel scans. Moreover, for the first time, we propose a
kernel-based spiking regressor using resonate and fire neurons for very
long-range sequences. Our network shows superior performance on even a 50k
sequence while being significantly energy-efficient. In addition, we conducted
a systematic analysis of the impact of heterogeneity, dissipation, and
conservation in resonate-and-fire SSMs.

### [69] [Revisit Modality Imbalance at the Decision Layer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14411)
*Xiaoyu Ma,Hao Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文揭示了多模态学习中的模态不平衡问题不仅发生在表示学习阶段，还显著体现在决策层，导致主导模态（如音频）压制较弱模态，并提出需要在决策层引入自适应权重分配机制来解决这一问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态学习通常面临模态不平衡问题，主导模态在联合优化过程中会压制较弱模态。本文发现这种不平衡不仅发生在表示学习阶段，在决策层也显著存在，即使经过充分预训练和平衡优化后，模型仍对某些模态（如音频）存在系统性偏好。

Method: 通过在音频-视觉数据集（CREMAD和Kinetic-Sounds）上进行实验，分析模型在决策层的偏差表现，并深入探究这种偏差的来源，发现其源于特征空间和决策权重分布的内在差异，而非仅由优化动态引起。

Result: 实验表明，即使经过广泛预训练和平衡优化，模型仍然对某些模态（如音频）表现出系统性偏差。进一步分析显示，这种偏差源于特征空间和决策权重分布的内在差异，融合阶段未校准的模态输出聚合会导致决策层权重偏差，阻碍较弱模态的有效贡献。

Conclusion: 未来的多模态系统应该更多地关注在决策层引入自适应权重分配机制，根据每个模态的能力进行相对平衡的权重分配，以解决模态不平衡问题。

Abstract: Multimodal learning integrates information from different modalities to
enhance model performance, yet it often suffers from modality imbalance, where
dominant modalities overshadow weaker ones during joint optimization. This
paper reveals that such an imbalance not only occurs during representation
learning but also manifests significantly at the decision layer. Experiments on
audio-visual datasets (CREMAD and Kinetic-Sounds) show that even after
extensive pretraining and balanced optimization, models still exhibit
systematic bias toward certain modalities, such as audio. Further analysis
demonstrates that this bias originates from intrinsic disparities in
feature-space and decision-weight distributions rather than from optimization
dynamics alone. We argue that aggregating uncalibrated modality outputs at the
fusion stage leads to biased decision-layer weighting, hindering weaker
modalities from contributing effectively. To address this, we propose that
future multimodal systems should focus more on incorporate adaptive weight
allocation mechanisms at the decision layer, enabling relative balanced
according to the capabilities of each modality.

TL;DR: 本文提出了交互一致性指数(IC-index)来评估药物-靶点亲和力预测中交互方向的准确性，补充了现有的预测性能评估指标。

Motivation: 现有药物-靶点亲和力预测方法主要关注亲和力值的准确性，但忽略了交互效应的方向性，而正确捕捉交互方向对于药物分配决策至关重要。

Method: 引入IC-index评估交互方向预测性能，证明当预测器无法捕捉交互时IC-index保持不变，并分析学习算法的置换等变性对交互捕捉能力的影响。

Conclusion: IC-index为药物-靶点亲和力预测提供了重要的交互方向评估维度，有助于提升药物分配决策的质量。

Abstract: Consider two sets of entities and their members' mutual affinity values, say
drug-target affinities (DTA). Drugs and targets are said to interact in their
effects on DTAs if drug's effect on it depends on the target. Presence of
interaction implies that assigning a drug to a target and another drug to
another target does not provide the same aggregate DTA as the reversed
assignment would provide. Accordingly, correctly capturing interactions enables
better decision-making, for example, in allocation of limited numbers of drug
doses to their best matching targets. Learning to predict DTAs is popularly
done from either solely from known DTAs or together with side information on
the entities, such as chemical structures of drugs and targets. In this paper,
we introduce interaction directions' prediction performance estimator we call
interaction concordance index (IC-index), for both fixed predictors and machine
learning algorithms aimed for inferring them. IC-index complements the
popularly used DTA prediction performance estimators by evaluating the ratio of
correctly predicted directions of interaction effects in data. First, we show
the invariance of IC-index on predictors unable to capture interactions.
Secondly, we show that learning algorithm's permutation equivariance regarding
drug and target identities implies its inability to capture interactions when
either drug, target or both are unseen during training. In practical
applications, this equivariance is remedied via incorporation of appropriate
side information on drugs and targets. We make a comprehensive empirical
evaluation over several biomedical interaction data sets with various
state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms. The experiments demonstrate how
different types of affinity strength prediction methods perform in terms of
IC-index complementing existing prediction performance estimators.

Motivation: MoE技术虽然能有效扩展模型规模，但其内存开销巨大，因此MoE模型压缩成为重要研究方向。

Method: 从专家输出合并的角度重新解释专家合并过程，将其视为在正向计算中插入额外矩阵，并基于此提出使用数学优化的MergeMoE方法。

Result: 在多个MoE模型上的评估显示，MergeMoE算法在相同压缩比下始终优于基线方法。

Conclusion: 从专家输出合并角度分析MoE压缩问题，提出的优化方法能有效提升压缩效果。

Abstract: The Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) technique has proven to be a promising solution
to efficiently scale the model size, which has been widely applied in recent
LLM advancements. However, the substantial memory overhead of MoE models has
made their compression an important research direction. In this work, we
provide a theoretical analysis of expert merging, a recently proposed technique
for compressing MoE models. Rather than interpreting expert merging from the
conventional perspective of parameter aggregation, we approach it from the
perspective of merging experts' outputs. Our key insight is that the merging
process can be interpreted as inserting additional matrices into the forward
computation, which naturally leads to an optimization formulation. Building on
this analysis, we introduce MergeMoE, a method that leverages mathematical
optimization to construct the compression matrices. We evaluate MergeMoE on
multiple MoE models and show that our algorithm consistently outperforms the
baselines with the same compression ratios.

Motivation: 研究大型语言模型剪枝后的权重恢复方法，比较重构与重训练的效果，挑战当前避免重训练的主流做法。

Method: 在GPT架构上进行广泛计算研究，比较不同粒度的重构方法（单矩阵、注意力组件、MLP组件、整个transformer块），并与完全重训练对比。

Result: 发现逐层重构注意力组件和MLP组件的方法在资源效率和困惑度方面都表现最优，甚至优于完全重训练，且简单剪枝标准配合适当重构能胜过复杂方法。

Conclusion: 重构方法比完全重训练更有效，挑战了"不惜一切代价避免重训练"的叙事，为LLM剪枝后的性能恢复提供了重要见解。

Abstract: While Neural Network pruning typically requires retraining the model to
recover pruning-induced performance degradation, state-of-the-art Large
Language Models (LLMs) pruning methods instead solve a layer-wise mask
selection and reconstruction problem on a small set of calibration data to
avoid full retraining, as it is considered computationally infeasible for LLMs.
Reconstructing single matrices in isolation has favorable properties, such as
convexity of the objective and significantly reduced memory requirements
compared to full retraining. In practice, however, reconstruction is often
implemented at coarser granularities, e.g., reconstructing a whole transformer
block against its dense activations instead of a single matrix. In this work,
we study the key design choices when reconstructing or retraining the remaining
weights after pruning. We conduct an extensive computational study on
state-of-the-art GPT architectures, and report several surprising findings that
challenge common intuitions about retraining after pruning. In particular, we
observe a free lunch scenario: reconstructing attention and MLP components
separately within each transformer block is nearly the most resource-efficient
yet achieves the best perplexity. Most importantly, this Pareto-optimal setup
achieves better performance than full retraining, despite requiring only a
fraction of the memory. Furthermore, we demonstrate that simple and efficient
pruning criteria such as Wanda can outperform much more complex approaches when
the reconstruction step is properly executed, highlighting its importance. Our
findings challenge the narrative that retraining should be avoided at all costs
and provide important insights into post-pruning performance recovery for LLMs.

Motivation: 当前生成建模方法难以准确再现地质结构特别是河流沉积物的连续性特征，而基于过程模型虽然准确但计算成本高昂。

Method: 使用生成对抗网络（GAN）进行生成建模，通过消融研究验证深度学习技术在3D河流沉积物图像生成中的适用性，并利用沉积时间监控GAN性能。

Result: GAN训练稳定，生成的样本能够再现沉积物的非平稳性和细节特征，没有出现模式崩溃或纯记忆训练数据的问题，且能够遵循地层叠加定律。

Conclusion: GAN在针对特定地质结构的训练数据集上表现出比预期更强的鲁棒性，利用地质原理如地层叠加定律来指导深度生成模型具有很大潜力。

Abstract: The distribution of resources in the subsurface is deeply linked to the
variations of its physical properties. Generative modeling has long been used
to predict those physical properties while quantifying the associated
uncertainty. But current approaches struggle to properly reproduce geological
structures, and fluvial deposits in particular, because of their continuity.
This study explores whether a generative adversarial network (GAN) - a type of
deep-learning algorithm for generative modeling - can be trained to reproduce
fluvial deposits simulated by a process-based model - a more expensive model
that mimics geological processes. An ablation study shows that developments
from the deep-learning community to generate large 2D images are directly
transferable to 3D images of fluvial deposits. Training remains stable, and the
generated samples reproduce the non-stationarity and details of the deposits
without mode collapse or pure memorization of the training data. Using a
process-based model to generate those training data allows us to include
valuable properties other than the usual physical properties. We show how the
deposition time let us monitor and validate the performance of a GAN by
checking that its samples honor the law of superposition. Our work joins a
series of previous studies suggesting that GANs are more robust that given
credit for, at least for training datasets targeting specific geological
structures. Whether this robustness transfers to larger 3D images and
multimodal datasets remains to be seen. Exploring how deep generative models
can leverage geological principles like the law of superposition shows a lot of
promise.

Abstract: Multi-class wine classification presents fundamental trade-offs between model
accuracy, feature dimensionality, and interpretability - critical factors for
production deployment in analytical chemistry. This paper presents a
comprehensive empirical study of One-vs-Rest logistic regression on the UCI
Wine dataset (178 samples, 3 cultivars, 13 chemical features), comparing
from-scratch gradient descent implementation against scikit-learn's optimized
solvers and quantifying L1 regularization effects on feature sparsity. Manual
gradient descent achieves 92.59 percent mean test accuracy with smooth
convergence, validating theoretical foundations, though scikit-learn provides
24x training speedup and 98.15 percent accuracy. Class-specific analysis
reveals distinct chemical signatures with heterogeneous patterns where color
intensity varies dramatically (0.31 to 16.50) across cultivars. L1
regularization produces 54-69 percent feature reduction with only 4.63 percent
accuracy decrease, demonstrating favorable interpretability-performance
trade-offs. We propose an optimal 5-feature subset achieving 62 percent
complexity reduction with estimated 92-94 percent accuracy, enabling
cost-effective deployment with 80 dollars savings per sample and 56 percent
time reduction. Statistical validation confirms robust generalization with
sub-2ms prediction latency suitable for real-time quality control. Our findings
provide actionable guidelines for practitioners balancing comprehensive
chemical analysis against targeted feature measurement in resource-constrained

Motivation: 现有大语言模型在分子优化中虽然能生成高层次编辑意图，但在执行具体结构修改时表现不佳，特别是在处理SMILES等非直观表示时。需要解决意图与执行之间的差距。

Method: 采用级联框架：首先生成人类可解释的编辑意图，然后将这些意图通过代码生成转换为可执行的结构编辑。

Result: 在化学反应和靶点特异性化合物对的真实编辑中达到98%以上的准确率，在下游优化基准测试中一致性提高38-86个百分点至90%以上，成功率高于基于SMILES的基线方法。

Conclusion: MECo通过将意图与执行对齐，实现了一致、可控和可解释的分子设计，为药物发现中的高保真反馈循环和人机协作工作流程奠定了基础。

Abstract: Molecular optimization is a central task in drug discovery that requires
precise structural reasoning and domain knowledge. While large language models
(LLMs) have shown promise in generating high-level editing intentions in
natural language, they often struggle to faithfully execute these
modifications-particularly when operating on non-intuitive representations like
SMILES. We introduce MECo, a framework that bridges reasoning and execution by
translating editing actions into executable code. MECo reformulates molecular
optimization for LLMs as a cascaded framework: generating human-interpretable
editing intentions from a molecule and property goal, followed by translating
those intentions into executable structural edits via code generation. Our
approach achieves over 98% accuracy in reproducing held-out realistic edits
derived from chemical reactions and target-specific compound pairs. On
downstream optimization benchmarks spanning physicochemical properties and
target activities, MECo substantially improves consistency by 38-86 percentage
points to 90%+ and achieves higher success rates over SMILES-based baselines
while preserving structural similarity. By aligning intention with execution,
MECo enables consistent, controllable and interpretable molecular design,
laying the foundation for high-fidelity feedback loops and collaborative
human-AI workflows in drug discovery.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前微调大型预训练语言模型时，噪声或偏离目标的训练样本会稀释监督信号。虽然小型精选数据集通常能与大型数据集性能相当，但系统高效识别高价值训练数据的方法仍未被充分探索。现有方法多依赖启发式或昂贵的重新训练。

Method: 核心是上下文近似（ICA）方法，通过在小规模精选holdout集上进行上下文条件化，估计模型在候选样本上训练后的holdout损失。ICA无需参考模型和额外微调，在局部线性化下等价于向holdout最优解的一阶更新。从ICA分数导出每个样本的权重，在模型参数演化时动态重加权梯度更新。

Result: 在SFT、DPO和SimPO等不同方法上，以及多种骨干网络和数据集上，基于ICA的重加权方法持续改进模型对齐效果，且开销极小。分析了分数更新频率和holdout示例数量k的敏感性。

Conclusion: ICA框架为数据选择和重加权提供了理论基础和高效实现，能显著提升模型对齐效果。但该方法在快速漂移的在线策略更新场景下存在局限性，为未来工作指明了方向。

Abstract: Fine-tuning large pretrained language models is a common approach for
aligning them with human preferences, but noisy or off-target examples can
dilute supervision. While small, well-chosen datasets often match the
performance of much larger ones, systematic and efficient ways to identify
high-value training data remain underexplored. Many current methods rely on
heuristics or expensive retraining. We present a theoretically grounded,
resource-efficient framework for data selection and reweighting. At its core is
an In-Context Approximation (ICA) that estimates the holdout loss a model would
incur after training on a candidate example by conditioning on a small, curated
holdout set in context. ICA requires no reference model and no additional
finetuning. Under a local linearization, ICA is equivalent to a first-order
update toward the holdout optimum, motivating its use as a proxy for data
value. We derive per-example weights from ICA scores, dynamically reweighting
gradient updates as model parameters evolve. Across SFT, DPO, and SimPO, and
over diverse backbones and datasets, ICA-based reweighting consistently
improves model alignment with minimal overhead. We analyze sensitivity to score
update frequency and the choice of $k$ holdout examples for in-context
demonstrations, and note limitations for rapidly drifting on-policy updates,
highlighting directions for future work. Code and prompts will be released.

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Causal discovery algorithms often perform poorly with limited samples. While
integrating expert knowledge (including from LLMs) as constraints promises to
improve performance, guarantees for existing methods require perfect
predictions or uncertainty estimates, making them unreliable for practical use.
We propose the Guess2Graph (G2G) framework, which uses expert guesses to guide
the sequence of statistical tests rather than replacing them. This maintains
statistical consistency while enabling performance improvements. We develop two
instantiations of G2G: PC-Guess, which augments the PC algorithm, and
gPC-Guess, a learning-augmented variant designed to better leverage
high-quality expert input. Theoretically, both preserve correctness regardless
of expert error, with gPC-Guess provably outperforming its non-augmented
counterpart in finite samples when experts are "better than random."
Empirically, both show monotonic improvement with expert accuracy, with
gPC-Guess achieving significantly stronger gains.

Motivation: 解决基于价值的强化学习智能体在部分不可逆环境中容易产生价值高估和不稳定的问题，提高决策的安全性和可靠性。

Method: 使用经验推导的状态-动作可逆性度量Phi(s,a)来量化返回先前状态的可能性，并引入选择性状态回滚操作，在预期回报显著低于估计值时回滚到前一个状态。

Result: 在CliffWalking v0环境中减少99.8%的灾难性跌落，平均回合回报提高55%；在Taxi v3环境中抑制99.9%的非法动作，累积奖励提高65.7%，同时显著降低奖励方差。

Conclusion: 可逆学习框架通过可逆性感知评估和针对性回滚，显著提升了强化学习的安全性和性能，特别是回滚机制是实现这些改进的关键组件。

Abstract: This paper proposes a reversible learning framework to improve the robustness
and efficiency of value based Reinforcement Learning agents, addressing
vulnerability to value overestimation and instability in partially irreversible
environments. The framework has two complementary core mechanisms: an
empirically derived transition reversibility measure called Phi of s and a, and
a selective state rollback operation. We introduce an online per state action
estimator called Phi that quantifies the likelihood of returning to a prior
state within a fixed horizon K. This measure is used to adjust the penalty term
during temporal difference updates dynamically, integrating reversibility
awareness directly into the value function. The system also includes a
selective rollback operator. When an action yields an expected return markedly
lower than its instantaneous estimated value and violates a predefined
threshold, the agent is penalized and returns to the preceding state rather
than progressing. This interrupts sub optimal high risk trajectories and avoids
catastrophic steps. By combining reversibility aware evaluation with targeted
rollback, the method improves safety, performance, and stability. In the
CliffWalking v0 domain, the framework reduced catastrophic falls by over 99.8
percent and yielded a 55 percent increase in mean episode return. In the Taxi
v3 domain, it suppressed illegal actions by greater than or equal to 99.9
percent and achieved a 65.7 percent improvement in cumulative reward, while
also sharply reducing reward variance in both environments. Ablation studies
confirm that the rollback mechanism is the critical component underlying these
safety and performance gains, marking a robust step toward safe and reliable
sequential decision making.

Abstract: Time Series Forecasting has made significant progress with the help of
Patching technique, which partitions time series into multiple patches to
effectively retain contextual semantic information into a representation space
beneficial for modeling long-term dependencies. However, conventional patching
partitions a time series into adjacent patches, which causes a fixed
representation space, thus resulting in insufficiently expressful
representations. In this paper, we pioneer the exploration of constructing a
selective representation space to flexibly include the most informative patches
for forecasting. Specifically, we propose the Selective Representation Space
(SRS) module, which utilizes the learnable Selective Patching and Dynamic
Reassembly techniques to adaptively select and shuffle the patches from the
contextual time series, aiming at fully exploiting the information of
contextual time series to enhance the forecasting performance of patch-based
models. To demonstrate the effectiveness of SRS module, we propose a simple yet
effective SRSNet consisting of SRS and an MLP head, which achieves
state-of-the-art performance on real-world datasets from multiple domains.
Furthermore, as a novel plugin-and-play module, SRS can also enhance the
performance of existing patch-based models. The resources are available at

Abstract: Selecting the latent dimensions (ranks) in tensor factorization is a central
challenge that often relies on heuristic methods. This paper introduces a
rigorous approach to determine rank identifiability in probabilistic tensor
models, based on prior predictive moment matching. We transform a set of moment
matching conditions into a log-linear system of equations in terms of marginal
moments, prior hyperparameters, and ranks; establishing an equivalence between
rank identifiability and the solvability of such system. We apply this
framework to four foundational tensor-models, demonstrating that the linear
structure of the PARAFAC/CP model, the chain structure of the Tensor Train
model, and the closed-loop structure of the Tensor Ring model yield solvable
systems, making their ranks identifiable. In contrast, we prove that the
symmetric topology of the Tucker model leads to an underdetermined system,
rendering the ranks unidentifiable by this method. For the identifiable models,
we derive explicit closed-form rank estimators based on the moments of observed
data only. We empirically validate these estimators and evaluate the robustness
of the proposal.

Motivation: 主流代理强化学习算法过度依赖熵信号来指导高不确定性工具调用步骤的自主探索，但过度依赖熵信号会施加额外约束，导致训练崩溃。

Method: AEPO包含两个核心组件：(1)动态熵平衡rollout机制，通过熵预监测自适应分配全局和分支采样预算，并对连续高熵工具调用步骤施加分支惩罚；(2)熵平衡策略优化，在高熵裁剪项中插入停止梯度操作，并结合熵感知优势估计优先学习高不确定性token。

high-uncertainty tool-call steps under the guidance of entropy, excessive
reliance on entropy signals can impose further constraints, leading to the
training collapse. In this paper, we delve into the challenges caused by
entropy and propose the Agentic Entropy-Balanced Policy Optimization (AEPO), an
agentic RL algorithm designed to balance entropy in both the rollout and policy
update phases. AEPO comprises two core components: (1) a dynamic
entropy-balanced rollout mechanism that adaptively allocate global and branch
sampling budget through entropy pre-monitoring, while imposing a branch penalty
on consecutive high-entropy tool-call steps to prevent over-branching issues;
and (2) Entropy-Balanced Policy Optimization that inserts a stop-gradient
operation into the high-entropy clipping term to preserve and properly rescale
gradients on high-entropy tokens, while incorporating entropy-aware advantage
estimation to prioritize learning on high-uncertainty tokens. Results across 14
challenging datasets show that AEPO consistently outperforms 7 mainstream RL
algorithms. With just 1K RL samples, Qwen3-14B with AEPO achieves impressive
results: 47.6% on GAIA, 11.2% on Humanity's Last Exam, and 43.0% on WebWalker
for Pass@1; 65.0% on GAIA, 26.0% on Humanity's Last Exam, and 70.0% on
WebWalker for Pass@5. Further analysis reveals that AEPO improves rollout
sampling diversity while maintaining stable policy entropy, facilitating
scalable web agent training.

*Yue Hou,He Zhu,Ruomei Liu,Yingke Su,Junran Wu,Ke Xu*

TL;DR: RedOUT是一个用于图分类的无监督OOD检测框架，通过结构熵减少结构冗余，提升检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 训练数据和测试数据之间的分布差异导致模型在遇到OOD样本时预测不准确，现有方法受结构冗余影响性能受限。

Method: 提出RedOUT框架，集成结构熵到测试时OOD检测中，引入冗余感知图信息瓶颈(ReGIB)，通过最小化结构熵减少冗余。

Result: 在真实数据集上的实验显示RedOUT在OOD检测方面表现优异，平均提升6.7%，在ClinTox/LIPO数据集对上比最佳竞争对手高出17.3%。

Conclusion: RedOUT通过结构熵有效减少图结构冗余，显著提升了图分类中的OOD检测性能。

Abstract: Distributional discrepancy between training and test data can lead models to
make inaccurate predictions when encountering out-of-distribution (OOD) samples
in real-world applications. Although existing graph OOD detection methods
leverage data-centric techniques to extract effective representations, their
performance remains compromised by structural redundancy that induces semantic
shifts. To address this dilemma, we propose RedOUT, an unsupervised framework
that integrates structural entropy into test-time OOD detection for graph
classification. Concretely, we introduce the Redundancy-aware Graph Information
Bottleneck (ReGIB) and decompose the objective into essential information and
irrelevant redundancy. By minimizing structural entropy, the decoupled
redundancy is reduced, and theoretically grounded upper and lower bounds are
proposed for optimization. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets
demonstrate the superior performance of RedOUT on OOD detection. Specifically,
our method achieves an average improvement of 6.7%, significantly surpassing
the best competitor by 17.3% on the ClinTox/LIPO dataset pair.

TL;DR: 本文研究了使用Hydra（一种双向线性时间结构化状态空间模型）替代TabPFN中的Transformer架构，以解决Transformer在序列长度上的二次复杂度问题，同时通过双向方法减轻SSM对输入顺序的敏感性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer架构在表格数据基础模型中表现出色，但其二次复杂度限制了处理长序列的能力。状态空间模型(SSM)具有线性复杂度，但天然对输入顺序敏感，这在行顺序无语义意义的表格数据中是不理想的性质。

Method: 使用Hydra双向线性时间结构化状态空间模型替代TabPFN中的Transformer，通过双向上下文聚合来减轻对输入顺序的依赖。

Result: 该方法显著降低了顺序依赖性，预测性能与原始TabPFN模型相当。

Conclusion: Hydra SSM作为Transformer的替代方案，在保持高效性的同时，通过双向方法有效缓解了顺序敏感性问题，为表格数据基础模型提供了有前景的替代架构。

Abstract: Recent advancements in foundation models for tabular data, such as TabPFN,
demonstrated that pretrained Transformer architectures can approximate Bayesian
inference with high predictive performance. However, Transformers suffer from
quadratic complexity with respect to sequence length, motivating the
exploration of more efficient sequence models. In this work, we investigate the
potential of using Hydra, a bidirectional linear-time structured state space
model (SSM), as an alternative to Transformers in TabPFN. A key challenge lies
in SSM's inherent sensitivity to the order of input tokens - an undesirable
property for tabular datasets where the row order is semantically meaningless.
We investigate to what extent a bidirectional approach can preserve efficiency
and enable symmetric context aggregation. Our experiments show that this
approach reduces the order-dependence, achieving predictive performance
competitive to the original TabPFN model.

TL;DR: 提出Conformal Labeling方法，通过控制假发现率(FDR)来识别AI预测可被证明可信的实例，确保AI分配标签的质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模数据集的高质量标注成本高昂，而AI模型预测标签存在不可避免的标注错误。现有选择性标注方法缺乏对AI分配标签质量的理论保证。

Method: 通过比较AI模型的预测置信度与校准实例中被AI误标的置信度，为每个测试实例构建符合性p值，选择p值低于数据依赖阈值的实例，证明AI预测可信。

Result: 实验表明该方法在图像和文本标注、LLM问答等多种任务中实现了严格的FDR控制和高功效。

Conclusion: Conformal Labeling方法提供了对AI分配标签质量的统计保证，能够有效控制标注错误率。

Abstract: Obtaining high-quality labels for large datasets is expensive, requiring
massive annotations from human experts. While AI models offer a cost-effective
alternative by predicting labels, their label quality is compromised by the
unavoidable labeling errors. Existing methods mitigate this issue through
selective labeling, where AI labels a subset and human labels the remainder.
However, these methods lack theoretical guarantees on the quality of
AI-assigned labels, often resulting in unacceptably high labeling error within
the AI-labeled subset. To address this, we introduce \textbf{Conformal
Labeling}, a novel method to identify instances where AI predictions can be
provably trusted. This is achieved by controlling the false discovery rate
(FDR), the proportion of incorrect labels within the selected subset. In
particular, we construct a conformal $p$-value for each test instance by
comparing AI models' predicted confidence to those of calibration instances
mislabeled by AI models. Then, we select test instances whose $p$-values are
below a data-dependent threshold, certifying AI models' predictions as
trustworthy. We provide theoretical guarantees that Conformal Labeling controls
the FDR below the nominal level, ensuring that a predefined fraction of
AI-assigned labels is correct on average. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that our method achieves tight FDR control with high power across various
tasks, including image and text labeling, and LLM QA.

Motivation: 现有蛋白质-配体结合构象预测方法难以平衡速度、准确性和物理合理性，需要开发更有效的方法。

Result: 在Astex和PDBbind测试集上表现出优异的对接成功率和物理合理性，比现代大规模共折叠模型快约25倍。

Conclusion: Matcha提供了一个高效准确的分子对接解决方案，在药物设计中具有重要应用价值。

Abstract: Accurate prediction of protein-ligand binding poses is crucial for
structure-based drug design, yet existing methods struggle to balance speed,
accuracy, and physical plausibility. We introduce Matcha, a novel molecular
docking pipeline that combines multi-stage flow matching with learned scoring
and physical validity filtering. Our approach consists of three sequential
stages applied consecutively to refine docking predictions, each implemented as
a flow matching model operating on appropriate geometric spaces
($\mathbb{R}^3$, $\mathrm{SO}(3)$, and $\mathrm{SO}(2)$). We enhance the
prediction quality through a dedicated scoring model and apply unsupervised
physical validity filters to eliminate unrealistic poses. Compared to various
approaches, Matcha demonstrates superior performance on Astex and PDBbind test
sets in terms of docking success rate and physical plausibility. Moreover, our
method works approximately 25 times faster than modern large-scale co-folding
models. The model weights and inference code to reproduce our results are

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前RAG系统主要处理单模态文本数据，在处理包含文本、图像、表格、方程和图形的非结构化多模态文档时效果有限。

Method: MAHA采用模态感知知识图谱，将密集向量检索与结构化图遍历相结合，编码跨模态语义和关系。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上，MAHA显著优于基线方法，ROUGE-L得分为0.486，实现完整的模态覆盖。

Conclusion: MAHA建立了一个可扩展且可解释的检索框架，通过结合嵌入和显式文档结构，实现了对非结构化多模态数据的模态感知推理。

Abstract: Current Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems primarily operate on
unimodal textual data, limiting their effectiveness on unstructured multimodal
documents. Such documents often combine text, images, tables, equations, and
graphs, each contributing unique information. In this work, we present a
Modality-Aware Hybrid retrieval Architecture (MAHA), designed specifically for
multimodal question answering with reasoning through a modality-aware knowledge
graph. MAHA integrates dense vector retrieval with structured graph traversal,
where the knowledge graph encodes cross-modal semantics and relationships. This
design enables both semantically rich and context-aware retrieval across
diverse modalities. Evaluations on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that
MAHA substantially outperforms baseline methods, achieving a ROUGE-L score of
0.486, providing complete modality coverage. These results highlight MAHA's
ability to combine embeddings with explicit document structure, enabling
effective multimodal retrieval. Our work establishes a scalable and
interpretable retrieval framework that advances RAG systems by enabling
modality-aware reasoning over unstructured multimodal data.

TL;DR: 提出FAL和FAL+高效Transformer架构，通过重定向第一层MHA输出到后续层MLP输入，消除每块的MHA-MLP连接，减少通信开销并实现并行执行。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有Transformer设计在多GPU并行训练中存在显著通信开销，特别是在张量并行中每个块的MHA-MLP连接需要all-reduce通信。研究发现MHA-MLP连接可以绕过以提高效率。

Method: FAL将第一层MHA输出重定向到后续层MLP输入，消除每块的MHA-MLP连接；FAL+在FAL基础上将归一化的第一注意力输出添加到后续层MHA输出中，增强MLP输入质量。

Result: FAL减少多GPU训练时间达44%，单GPU吞吐量提升1.18倍，困惑度优于基线GPT；FAL+在训练时间不增加的情况下实现更低的困惑度。

Conclusion: FAL和FAL+通过创新性地重定向注意力输出，有效解决了Transformer并行训练中的通信瓶颈，在保持模型质量的同时显著提升训练效率。

Abstract: As training billion-scale transformers becomes increasingly common, employing
multiple distributed GPUs along with parallel training methods has become a
standard practice. However, existing transformer designs suffer from
significant communication overhead, especially in Tensor Parallelism (TP),
where each block's MHA-MLP connection requires an all-reduce communication.
Through our investigation, we show that the MHA-MLP connections can be bypassed
for efficiency, while the attention output of the first layer can serve as an
alternative signal for the bypassed connection. Motivated by the observations,
we propose FAL (First Attentions Last), an efficient transformer architecture
that redirects the first MHA output to the MLP inputs of the following layers,
eliminating the per-block MHA-MLP connections. This removes the all-reduce
communication and enables parallel execution of MHA and MLP on a single GPU. We
also introduce FAL+, which adds the normalized first attention output to the
MHA outputs of the following layers to augment the MLP input for the model
quality. Our evaluation shows that FAL reduces multi-GPU training time by up to
44%, improves single-GPU throughput by up to 1.18x, and achieves better
perplexity compared to the baseline GPT. FAL+ achieves even lower perplexity
without increasing the training time than the baseline.

Conclusion: LeapFactual方法具有广泛适用性，增强了科学知识发现和非专家可解释性，为高风险领域提供了更可靠的反事实解释工具。

Abstract: The growing integration of machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence
(AI) models into high-stakes domains such as healthcare and scientific research
calls for models that are not only accurate but also interpretable. Among the
existing explainable methods, counterfactual explanations offer
interpretability by identifying minimal changes to inputs that would alter a
model's prediction, thus providing deeper insights. However, current
counterfactual generation methods suffer from critical limitations, including
gradient vanishing, discontinuous latent spaces, and an overreliance on the
alignment between learned and true decision boundaries. To overcome these
limitations, we propose LeapFactual, a novel counterfactual explanation
algorithm based on conditional flow matching. LeapFactual generates reliable
and informative counterfactuals, even when true and learned decision boundaries
diverge. Following a model-agnostic approach, LeapFactual is not limited to
models with differentiable loss functions. It can even handle human-in-the-loop
systems, expanding the scope of counterfactual explanations to domains that
require the participation of human annotators, such as citizen science. We
provide extensive experiments on benchmark and real-world datasets showing that
LeapFactual generates accurate and in-distribution counterfactual explanations
that offer actionable insights. We observe, for instance, that our reliable
counterfactual samples with labels aligning to ground truth can be beneficially
used as new training data to enhance the model. The proposed method is broadly
applicable and enhances both scientific knowledge discovery and non-expert
interpretability.

Abstract: We address the problem of distribution shift in unsupervised domain
adaptation with a moment-matching approach. Existing methods typically align
low-order statistical moments of the source and target distributions in an
embedding space using ad-hoc similarity measures. We propose a principled
alternative that instead leverages the intrinsic geometry of these
distributions by adopting a Riemannian distance for this alignment. Our key
novelty lies in expressing the first- and second-order moments as a single
symmetric positive definite (SPD) matrix through Siegel embeddings. This
enables simultaneous adaptation of both moments using the natural geometric
distance on the shared manifold of SPD matrices, preserving the mean and
covariance structure of the source and target distributions and yielding a more
faithful metric for cross-domain comparison. We connect the Riemannian manifold
distance to the target-domain error bound, and validate the method on image
denoising and image classification benchmarks. Our code is publicly available
at https://github.com/shayangharib/GeoAdapt.

Abstract: This paper proposes a low-power online anomaly detection framework based on
neuromorphic wireless sensor networks, encompassing possible use cases such as
brain-machine interfaces and remote environmental monitoring. In the considered
system, a central reader node actively queries a subset of neuromorphic sensor
nodes (neuro-SNs) at each time frame. The neuromorphic sensors are
event-driven, producing spikes in correspondence to relevant changes in the
monitored system. The queried neuro-SNs respond to the reader with impulse
radio (IR) transmissions that directly encode the sensed local events. The
reader processes these event-driven signals to determine whether the monitored
environment is in a normal or anomalous state, while rigorously controlling the
false discovery rate (FDR) of detections below a predefined threshold. The
proposed approach employs an online hypothesis testing method with e-values to
maintain FDR control without requiring knowledge of the anomaly rate, and it
dynamically optimizes the sensor querying strategy by casting it as a best-arm
identification problem in a multi-armed bandit framework. Extensive performance
evaluation demonstrates that the proposed method can reliably detect anomalies
under stringent FDR requirements, while efficiently scheduling sensor
communications and achieving low detection latency.

Conclusion: FedPPA方法有效解决了联邦学习中的模型和数据异构性问题，在保持强个性化的同时提升了全局模型性能

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is designed as a decentralized, privacy-preserving
machine learning paradigm that enables multiple clients to collaboratively
train a model without sharing their data. In real-world scenarios, however,
clients often have heterogeneous computational resources and hold
non-independent and identically distributed data (non-IID), which poses
significant challenges during training. Personalized Federated Learning (PFL)
has emerged to address these issues by customizing models for each client based
on their unique data distribution. Despite its potential, existing PFL
approaches typically overlook the coexistence of model and data heterogeneity
arising from clients with diverse computational capabilities. To overcome this
limitation, we propose a novel method, called Progressive Parameter Alignment
(FedPPA), which progressively aligns the weights of common layers across
clients with the global model's weights. Our approach not only mitigates
inconsistencies between global and local models during client updates, but also
preserves client's local knowledge, thereby enhancing personalization
robustness in non-IID settings. To further enhance the global model performance
while retaining strong personalization, we also integrate entropy-based
weighted averaging into the FedPPA framework. Experiments on three image
classification datasets, including MNIST, FMNIST, and CIFAR-10, demonstrate
that FedPPA consistently outperforms existing FL algorithms, achieving superior
performance in personalized adaptation.

TL;DR: 提出了Seesaw框架，通过在学习率衰减时同时增加批量大小来加速语言模型训练，在保持损失动态的同时减少串行步骤。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 批量大小增加是加速大语言模型预训练的有效策略，但对于自适应优化器如Adam的最优策略尚不明确，通常需要启发式调参。

Method: 开发了Seesaw框架：当标准调度器将学习率减半时，Seesaw将学习率乘以1/√2并加倍批量大小，保持损失动态同时减少串行步骤。

Result: 在150M/300M/600M参数模型上，Seesaw在相同FLOPs下与余弦衰减匹配，同时减少约36%的挂钟时间，接近理论极限。

Conclusion: Seesaw提供了一种原则性的批量大小调度方法，在保持训练质量的同时显著加速自适应优化器的训练过程。

Abstract: Increasing the batch size during training -- a ''batch ramp'' -- is a
promising strategy to accelerate large language model pretraining. While for
SGD, doubling the batch size can be equivalent to halving the learning rate,
the optimal strategy for adaptive optimizers like Adam is less clear. As a
result, any batch-ramp scheduling, if used at all, is typically tuned
heuristically. This work develops a principled framework for batch-size
scheduling and introduces Seesaw: whenever a standard scheduler would halve the
learning rate, Seesaw instead multiplies it by $1/\sqrt{2}$ and doubles the
batch size, preserving loss dynamics while reducing serial steps.
Theoretically, we provide, to our knowledge, the first finite-sample proof of
equivalence between learning-rate decay and batch-size ramp-up for SGD on noisy
linear regression, and we extend this equivalence to normalized SGD, a
tractable proxy for Adam, under a variance-dominated regime observed in
practice. Empirically, on 150M/300M/600M-parameter models trained at Chinchilla
scale using a constant (critical) batch size, Seesaw matches cosine decay at
equal FLOPs while reducing wall-clock time by $\approx 36\%$, approaching the
theoretical limit implied by our analysis.

Conclusion: INDAGO-Nexus通过多目标优化方法显著提高了测试效果和效率，能够发现更多样化的故障场景。

Abstract: Testing deep reinforcement learning (DRL) agents in safety-critical domains
requires discovering diverse failure scenarios. Existing tools such as INDAGO
rely on single-objective optimization focused solely on maximizing failure
counts, but this does not ensure discovered scenarios are diverse or reveal
distinct error types. We introduce INDAGO-Nexus, a multi-objective search
approach that jointly optimizes for failure likelihood and test scenario
diversity using multi-objective evolutionary algorithms with multiple diversity
metrics and Pareto front selection strategies. We evaluated INDAGO-Nexus on
three DRL agents: humanoid walker, self-driving car, and parking agent. On
average, INDAGO-Nexus discovers up to 83% and 40% more unique failures (test
effectiveness) than INDAGO in the SDC and Parking scenarios, respectively,
while reducing time-to-failure by up to 67% across all agents.

Motivation: 下一词预测(NTP)在长期推理、规划和创意写作方面存在局限，多词预测(MTP)只能捕捉短期依赖关系，改进有限。需要一种能处理长期依赖的方法。

Method: 提出未来摘要预测(FSP)，训练一个辅助头来预测长期未来的紧凑表示。探索两种变体：手工制作的摘要(如词袋摘要)和学习的摘要(使用从右到左训练的反向语言模型生成的嵌入)。

Result: 在3B和8B参数模型的大规模预训练实验中，FSP在数学、推理和编程基准测试中均优于NTP和MTP。

Conclusion: FSP通过预测长期未来摘要有效提升了语言模型的长期推理能力，为改进语言模型的生成质量提供了有前景的方向。

Abstract: Next-token prediction (NTP) has driven the success of large language models
(LLMs), but it struggles with long-horizon reasoning, planning, and creative
writing, with these limitations largely attributed to teacher-forced training.
Multi-token prediction (MTP) partially mitigates these issues by predicting
several future tokens at once, but it mostly captures short-range dependencies
and offers limited improvement. We propose future summary prediction (FSP),
which trains an auxiliary head to predict a compact representation of the
long-term future, preserving information relevant for long-form generations. We
explore two variants of FSP: handcrafted summaries, for example, a bag of words
summary of the future of the sequence, and learned summaries, which use
embeddings produced by a reverse language model trained from right to left.
Large-scale pretraining experiments (3B and 8B-parameter models) demonstrate
that FSP provides improvements over both NTP and MTP across math, reasoning,
and coding benchmarks.

Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of estimating causal directed acyclic graphs
in linear non-Gaussian acyclic models with latent confounders (LvLiNGAM).
Existing methods assume mutually independent latent confounders or cannot
properly handle models with causal relationships among observed variables.
  We propose a novel algorithm that identifies causal DAGs in LvLiNGAM,
allowing causal structures among latent variables, among observed variables,
and between the two. The proposed method leverages higher-order cumulants of
observed data to identify the causal structure. Extensive simulations and
experiments with real-world data demonstrate the validity and practical utility
of the proposed algorithm.

Abstract: We propose an active jammer localization framework that combines Bayesian
optimization with acquisition-aware path planning. Unlike passive crowdsourced
methods, our approach adaptively guides a mobile agent to collect high-utility
Received Signal Strength measurements while accounting for urban obstacles and
mobility constraints. For this, we modified the A* algorithm, A-UCB*, by
incorporating acquisition values into trajectory costs, leading to
high-acquisition planned paths. Simulations on realistic urban scenarios show
that the proposed method achieves accurate localization with fewer measurements
compared to uninformed baselines, demonstrating consistent performance under
different environments.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SPHeRe是一种新型无监督学习方法，通过整合正交性和结构信息保留来解决传统Hebbian学习在机器学习中的局限性，在图像分类、持续学习和迁移学习任务中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统Hebbian学习在机器学习中存在连接更新无约束和缺乏反馈调节的问题，限制了其在复杂网络架构和任务中的有效扩展。

Method: SPHeRe通过局部辅助非线性块整合正交性和结构信息保留，结构信息保留损失通过轻量级投影反向传播到输入作为反馈调节，正交性约束确保更新幅度的有界性。

Result: 在CIFAR-10、CIFAR-100和Tiny-ImageNet等标准图像分类基准上达到无监督突触可塑性方法的SOTA性能，在持续学习、迁移学习和图像重建任务中表现出强大效果。

Conclusion: 这项工作展示了Hebbian无监督学习规则在现代深度学习框架中的竞争力和潜力，证明了无需严格依赖反向传播的高效生物启发学习算法的可能性。

Abstract: Hebbian learning is a biological principle that intuitively describes how
neurons adapt their connections through repeated stimuli. However, when applied
to machine learning, it suffers serious issues due to the unconstrained updates
of the connections and the lack of accounting for feedback mediation. Such
shortcomings limit its effective scaling to complex network architectures and
tasks. To this end, here we introduce the Structural Projection Hebbian
Representation (SPHeRe), a novel unsupervised learning method that integrates
orthogonality and structural information preservation through a local auxiliary
nonlinear block. The loss for structural information preservation
backpropagates to the input through an auxiliary lightweight projection that
conceptually serves as feedback mediation while the orthogonality constraints
account for the boundedness of updating magnitude. Extensive experimental
results show that SPHeRe achieves SOTA performance among unsupervised synaptic
plasticity approaches on standard image classification benchmarks, including
CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Tiny-ImageNet. Furthermore, the method exhibits strong
effectiveness in continual learning and transfer learning scenarios, and image
reconstruction tasks show the robustness and generalizability of the extracted
features. This work demonstrates the competitiveness and potential of Hebbian
unsupervised learning rules within modern deep learning frameworks,
demonstrating the possibility of efficient and biologically inspired learning
algorithms without the strong dependence on strict backpropagation. Our code is
available at https://github.com/brain-intelligence-lab/SPHeRe.

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合学习排列矩阵的结构化稀疏训练方法PA-DST，在保持高精度的同时显著提升了训练和推理速度


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 结构化稀疏在现代GPU上能加速训练和推理，但在精度上仍落后于非结构化动态稀疏训练，主要原因是表达能力受限

Method: 为每个层学习一个排列矩阵与结构化权重矩阵联合训练，应用于块、N:M和对角线三种典型结构

Result: 在ImageNet-1K和WikiText-103上，PA-DST在90-95%稀疏度下匹配非结构化基线精度，同时训练速度提升1.21倍，推理速度提升2.9倍

Conclusion: 结构+学习排列的组合在精度和效率之间找到了最佳平衡点

Abstract: Structured sparsity accelerates training and inference on modern GPUs, yet it
still trails unstructured dynamic sparse training (DST) in accuracy. The
shortfall stems from a loss of expressivity: whereas a dense layer can realize
every possible mask obtained by choosing any $w$ active weights out of $n$, a
fixed block or N:M layout explores only a subset of those possibilities. We
propose to close this gap by learning, for each layer, a single permutation
matrix jointly with the structured weight matrix. Applied to three canonical
structures -- block, N:M, and diagonals -- we show that permutation-augmented
DST (PA-DST) matches unstructured baselines (RigL, SET) at 90--95\% sparsity on
ImageNet-1K (ViT-B/16) and WikiText-103 (GPT-2), yet trains up to $1.21\times$
and infers up to $2.9\times$ faster. The results position structure + learned
permutation as a sweet spot between accuracy and efficiency.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文提出了ShifTS框架，通过软注意力机制在时间序列预测中同时处理时间偏移和概念漂移问题，显著提升了预测精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 时间序列数据具有动态特性，存在分布偏移问题。现有研究主要关注时间偏移，但对概念漂移的处理相对不足。传统基于不变性学习的概念漂移方法在时间序列预测中面临挑战，需要专门的方法来同时解决这两种分布偏移。

Method: 提出ShifTS框架：1）使用软注意力机制从回看和预测时间序列中寻找不变模式；2）首先处理时间偏移作为解决概念漂移的前提；3）采用方法无关的统一框架，先处理时间偏移再处理概念漂移。

Result: 大量实验表明，ShifTS能够持续提升无关模型的预测精度，在多个数据集上优于现有的概念漂移、时间偏移及其组合基线方法。

Conclusion: ShifTS框架有效解决了时间序列预测中的分布偏移问题，特别是对概念漂移和时间偏移的统一处理，为时间序列预测提供了稳健的解决方案。

Abstract: Time-series forecasting finds broad applications in real-world scenarios. Due
to the dynamic nature of time series data, it is important for time-series
forecasting models to handle potential distribution shifts over time. In this
paper, we initially identify two types of distribution shifts in time series:
concept drift and temporal shift. We acknowledge that while existing studies
primarily focus on addressing temporal shift issues in time series forecasting,
designing proper concept drift methods for time series forecasting has received
comparatively less attention.
  Motivated by the need to address potential concept drift, while conventional
concept drift methods via invariant learning face certain challenges in
time-series forecasting, we propose a soft attention mechanism that finds
invariant patterns from both lookback and horizon time series. Additionally, we
emphasize the critical importance of mitigating temporal shifts as a
preliminary to addressing concept drift. In this context, we introduce ShifTS,
a method-agnostic framework designed to tackle temporal shift first and then
concept drift within a unified approach. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
efficacy of ShifTS in consistently enhancing the forecasting accuracy of
agnostic models across multiple datasets, and outperforming existing concept
drift, temporal shift, and combined baselines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统机器学习模型依赖特征工程，神经网络能自动学习特征但缺乏可解释性且需要专用硬件。希望找到既能自动学习有用特征又保持可解释性的方法。

Method: 使用LLM生成特征函数代码，结合决策树构建LeaPR模型。提出两种算法：基于FunSearch的特征学习算法和ID3变体算法，在决策树分裂时按需生成新特征。

Result: 在象棋位置评估、图像和文本分类等任务上，LeaPR模型学习到高质量的非神经网络预测器，性能与神经网络相当。

Conclusion: LeaPR提供了一种灵活的可解释端到端学习范式，特征和预测结果都可以被直接检查和理解。

Abstract: Classical models for supervised machine learning, such as decision trees, are
efficient and interpretable predictors, but their quality is highly dependent
on the particular choice of input features. Although neural networks can learn
useful representations directly from raw data (e.g., images or text), this
comes at the expense of interpretability and the need for specialized hardware
to run them efficiently. In this paper, we explore a hypothesis class we call
Learned Programmatic Representations (LeaPR) models, which stack arbitrary
features represented as code (functions from data points to scalars) and
decision tree predictors. We synthesize feature functions using Large Language
Models (LLMs), which have rich prior knowledge in a wide range of domains and a
remarkable ability to write code using existing domain-specific libraries. We
propose two algorithms to learn LeaPR models from supervised data. First, we
design an adaptation of FunSearch to learn features rather than directly
generate predictors. Then, we develop a novel variant of the classical ID3
algorithm for decision tree learning, where new features are generated on
demand when splitting leaf nodes. In experiments from chess position evaluation
to image and text classification, our methods learn high-quality, neural
network-free predictors often competitive with neural networks. Our work
suggests a flexible paradigm for learning interpretable representations
end-to-end where features and predictions can be readily inspected and
understood.

Motivation: SSMs作为Transformer的替代方案，主要优势在于长上下文和长序列生成效率。但研究发现SSMs在理论上存在根本性限制，无法处理真正长序列问题，这削弱了其主要竞争优势。

Method: 通过理论分析证明SSMs的局限性，然后提出通过让SSMs交互式访问外部工具来克服这一限制。在适当工具选择和问题相关训练数据下，SSMs可以学习解决任何可处理问题。

Result: 工具增强的SSMs在算术、推理和编程任务上实现了显著的序列长度泛化能力，表现出色。

Conclusion: SSMs在交互式工具和智能体环境中，有潜力成为Transformer的高效替代方案，特别是在需要长序列处理的场景中。

Abstract: State Space Models (SSMs) have become the leading alternative to Transformers
for sequence modeling. Their primary advantage is efficiency in long-context
and long-form generation, enabled by fixed-size memory and linear scaling of
computational complexity. We begin this work by showing a simple theoretical
result stating that SSMs cannot accurately solve any ``truly long-form''
generation problem (in a sense we formally define), undermining their main
competitive advantage. However, we show that this limitation can be mitigated
by allowing SSMs interactive access to external tools. In fact, we show that
given the right choice of tool access and problem-dependent training data, SSMs
can learn to solve any tractable problem and generalize to arbitrary problem
length/complexity (i.e., achieve length generalization). Following our
theoretical finding, we demonstrate that tool-augmented SSMs achieve remarkable
length generalization on a variety of arithmetic, reasoning, and coding tasks.
These findings highlight SSMs as a potential efficient alternative to
Transformers in interactive tool-based and agentic settings.

Motivation: 6G多RAT网络中，蜂窝和WiFi发射器共存，需要可靠的移动性决策来应对快速信道动态、干扰和异构覆盖。当前切换方法仍然是高度反应性和事件触发的。

Conclusion: 提出的P-CHO框架能够实现准确、低延迟和主动的切换，适用于6G多RAT部署中的ML辅助切换引导。

Abstract: The emerging paradigm of 6G multiple Radio Access Technology (multi-RAT)
networks, where cellular and Wireless Fidelity (WiFi) transmitters coexist,
requires mobility decisions that remain reliable under fast channel dynamics,
interference, and heterogeneous coverage. Handover in multi-RAT deployments is
still highly reactive and event-triggered, relying on instantaneous
measurements and threshold events. This work proposes a Machine Learning
(ML)-assisted Predictive Conditional Handover (P-CHO) framework based on a
model-driven and short-horizon signal quality forecasts. We present a
generalized P-CHO sequence workflow orchestrated by a RAT Steering Controller,
which standardizes data collection, parallel per-RAT predictions, decision
logic with hysteresis-based conditions, and CHO execution. Considering a
realistic multi-RAT environment, we train RAT-aware Long Short Term Memory
(LSTM) networks to forecast the signal quality indicators of mobile users along
randomized trajectories. The proposed P-CHO models are trained and evaluated
under different channel models for cellular and IEEE 802.11 WiFi integrated
coverage. We study the impact of hyperparameter tuning of LSTM models under
different system settings, and compare direct multi-step versus recursive P-CHO
variants. Comparisons against baseline predictors are also carried out.
Finally, the proposed P-CHO is tested under soft and hard handover settings,
showing that hysteresis-enabled P-CHO scheme is able to reduce handover
failures and ping-pong events. Overall, the proposed P-CHO framework can enable
accurate, low-latency, and proactive handovers suitable for ML-assisted
handover steering in 6G multi-RAT deployments.

Abstract: Reward machines are an established tool for dealing with reinforcement
learning problems in which rewards are sparse and depend on complex sequences
of actions. However, existing algorithms for learning reward machines assume an
overly idealized setting where rewards have to be free of noise. To overcome
this practical limitation, we introduce a novel type of reward machines, called
stochastic reward machines, and an algorithm for learning them. Our algorithm,
based on constraint solving, learns minimal stochastic reward machines from the
explorations of a reinforcement learning agent. This algorithm can easily be
paired with existing reinforcement learning algorithms for reward machines and
guarantees to converge to an optimal policy in the limit. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of our algorithm in two case studies and show that it outperforms
both existing methods and a naive approach for handling noisy reward functions.

Abstract: Machine Unlearning aims to remove specific data from trained models,
addressing growing privacy and ethical concerns. We provide a theoretical
analysis of a simple and widely used method - gradient ascent - used to reverse
the influence of a specific data point without retraining from scratch.
Leveraging the implicit bias of gradient descent towards solutions that satisfy
the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions of a margin maximization problem, we
quantify the quality of the unlearned model by evaluating how well it satisfies
these conditions w.r.t. the retained data. To formalize this idea, we propose a
new success criterion, termed \textbf{$(\epsilon, \delta, \tau)$-successful}
unlearning, and show that, for both linear models and two-layer neural networks
with high dimensional data, a properly scaled gradient-ascent step satisfies
this criterion and yields a model that closely approximates the retrained
solution on the retained data. We also show that gradient ascent performs
successful unlearning while still preserving generalization in a synthetic
Gaussian-mixture setting.

Method: 研究发现后门在模型权重空间中与良性任务是解耦的，基于这一发现提出了一种简单的遗忘方法，利用这种解耦特性来隔离和消除后门的影响。

Result: 在CLIP模型和常见对抗性触发器的实验中，该方法实现了近乎完美的后门遗忘，平均保持96%的干净准确率。即使攻击未知，也能通过逆向工程触发器成功移除后门。

Conclusion: 该方法在遗忘效果和干净准确率权衡方面优于现有最先进的防御方法，为后门攻击防御提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Foundation models have revolutionized computer vision by enabling broad
generalization across diverse tasks. Yet, they remain highly susceptible to
adversarial perturbations and targeted backdoor attacks. Mitigating such
vulnerabilities remains an open challenge, especially given that the
large-scale nature of the models prohibits retraining to ensure safety.
Existing backdoor removal approaches rely on costly fine-tuning to override the
harmful behavior, and can often degrade performance on other unrelated tasks.
This raises the question of whether backdoors can be removed without
compromising the general capabilities of the models. In this work, we address
this question and study how backdoors are encoded in the model weight space,
finding that they are disentangled from other benign tasks. Specifically, this
separation enables the isolation and erasure of the backdoor's influence on the
model with minimal impact on clean performance. Building on this insight, we
introduce a simple unlearning method that leverages such disentanglement.
Through extensive experiments with CLIP-based models and common adversarial
triggers, we show that, given the knowledge of the attack, our method achieves
approximately perfect unlearning, while retaining, on average, 96% of clean
accuracy. Additionally, we demonstrate that even when the attack and its
presence are unknown, our method successfully unlearns backdoors by proper
estimation using reverse-engineered triggers. Overall, our method consistently
yields better unlearning and clean accuracy tradeoffs when compared to present
state-of-the-art defenses.

Conclusion: HEA框架证明了在真实数据集上为复杂学习算法建立从数据集结构到模型性能的端到端理论是可行的。

Abstract: We study kernel regression with common rotation-invariant kernels on real
datasets including CIFAR-5m, SVHN, and ImageNet. We give a theoretical
framework that predicts learning curves (test risk vs. sample size) from only
two measurements: the empirical data covariance matrix and an empirical
polynomial decomposition of the target function $f_*$. The key new idea is an
analytical approximation of a kernel's eigenvalues and eigenfunctions with
respect to an anisotropic data distribution. The eigenfunctions resemble
Hermite polynomials of the data, so we call this approximation the Hermite
eigenstructure ansatz (HEA). We prove the HEA for Gaussian data, but we find
that real image data is often "Gaussian enough" for the HEA to hold well in
practice, enabling us to predict learning curves by applying prior results
relating kernel eigenstructure to test risk. Extending beyond kernel
regression, we empirically find that MLPs in the feature-learning regime learn
Hermite polynomials in the order predicted by the HEA. Our HEA framework is a
proof of concept that an end-to-end theory of learning which maps dataset
structure all the way to model performance is possible for nontrivial learning
algorithms on real datasets.

Conclusion: 谨慎探索策略能够在无导师情况下安全地部署学习智能体，避免不可逆错误，同时保持学习效率。

Abstract: In high-stakes AI applications, even a single action can cause irreparable
damage. However, nearly all of sequential decision-making theory assumes that
all errors are recoverable (e.g., by bounding rewards). Standard bandit
algorithms that explore aggressively may cause irreparable damage when this
assumption fails. Some prior work avoids irreparable errors by asking for help
from a mentor, but a mentor may not always be available. In this work, we
formalize a model of learning with unbounded rewards without a mentor as a
two-action contextual bandit with an abstain option: at each round the agent
observes an input and chooses either to abstain (always 0 reward) or to commit
(execute a preexisting task policy). Committing yields rewards that are
upper-bounded but can be arbitrarily negative, and the commit reward is assumed
Lipschitz in the input. We propose a caution-based algorithm that learns when
not to learn: it chooses a trusted region and commits only where the available
evidence does not already certify harm. Under these conditions and i.i.d.
inputs, we establish sublinear regret guarantees, theoretically demonstrating
the effectiveness of cautious exploration for deploying learning agents safely
in high-stakes environments.

Abstract: Frontier reasoning models have exhibited incredible capabilities across a
wide array of disciplines, driven by posttraining large language models (LLMs)
with reinforcement learning (RL). However, despite the widespread success of
this paradigm, much of the literature has been devoted to disentangling truly
novel behaviors that emerge during RL but are not present in the base models.
In our work, we approach this question from a different angle, instead asking
whether comparable reasoning capabilites can be elicited from base models at
inference time by pure sampling, without any additional training. Inspired by
Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques for sampling from sharpened
distributions, we propose a simple iterative sampling algorithm leveraging the
base models' own likelihoods. Over different base models, we show that our
algorithm offers substantial boosts in reasoning that nearly match and even
outperform those from RL on a wide variety of single-shot tasks, including
MATH500, HumanEval, and GPQA. Moreover, our sampler avoids the collapse in
diversity over multiple samples that is characteristic of RL-posttraining.
Crucially, our method does not require training, curated datasets, or a
verifier, suggesting broad applicability beyond easily verifiable domains.

Abstract: The fields of explainable AI and mechanistic interpretability aim to uncover
the internal structure of neural networks, with circuit discovery as a central
tool for understanding model computations. Existing approaches, however, rely
on manual inspection and remain limited to toy tasks. Automated
interpretability offers scalability by analyzing isolated features and their
activations, but it often misses interactions between features and depends
strongly on external LLMs and dataset quality. Transcoders have recently made
it possible to separate feature attributions into input-dependent and
input-invariant components, providing a foundation for more systematic circuit
analysis. Building on this, we propose WeightLens and CircuitLens, two
complementary methods that go beyond activation-based analysis. WeightLens
interprets features directly from their learned weights, removing the need for
explainer models or datasets while matching or exceeding the performance of
existing methods on context-independent features. CircuitLens captures how
feature activations arise from interactions between components, revealing
circuit-level dynamics that activation-only approaches cannot identify.
Together, these methods increase interpretability robustness and enhance
scalable mechanistic analysis of circuits while maintaining efficiency and
quality.

### [111] [Efficient Parallel Samplers for Recurrent-Depth Models and Their Connection to Diffusion Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14961)
*Jonas Geiping,Xinyu Yang,Guinan Su*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于扩散模型的采样器，用于加速循环深度语言模型的生成，在保持相同时间预算下获得比自回归生成更强的表达能力，并在3.5B参数模型上实现5倍加速。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索循环深度模型与扩散语言模型之间的关系，利用其相似性来加速模型推理生成过程。

Method: 开发了一种扩散强制采样器，通过在每次前向传播时解码新token，同时并行细化这些token的潜在状态。

Result: 该采样器可直接应用于现有3.5B循环深度transformer，无需调优即可实现5倍加速，生成表达能力严格优于基线自回归方法。

Conclusion: 循环深度模型可自然地视为强大的连续因果扩散语言模型，该采样器为并行化推理中的额外计算提供了高效机制。

Abstract: Language models with recurrent depth, also referred to as universal or looped
when considering transformers, are defined by the capacity to increase their
computation through the repetition of layers. Recent efforts in pretraining
have demonstrated that these architectures can scale to modern language
modeling tasks while exhibiting advantages in reasoning tasks. In this work, we
examine the relationship between recurrent-depth models and diffusion language
models. Building on their similarities, we develop a new diffusion forcing
sampler for these models to accelerate generation. The sampler advances by
decoding new tokens at every forward pass of the model, while the latent states
of these tokens can be further refined in parallel through recurrence.
Theoretically, generation with our sampler is strictly more expressive than the
baseline autoregressive generation using the same time budget on modern
hardware. Moreover, this sampler, based on principles from diffusion
literature, can be directly applied to existing 3.5B recurrent-depth
transformers without any tuning, leading to up to a 5x speedup. Consequently,
our findings not only provide an efficient mechanism for parallelizing the
extra computation in recurrent-depth models at inference, but also suggest that
such models can be naturally viewed as strong continuous, though causal,
diffusion language models.

*Zachary Robertson*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出使用恒等链接函数而非传统的logit/probit链接来保持TVD-MI成对比较的加性结构，通过Gini熵最大化推导出盒约束最小二乘模型，在保持代理排名的同时显著减少评估次数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统IRT方法使用logistic链接函数会引入曲率破坏TVD-MI成对比较的加性结构，需要找到保持这种几何特性的更合适方法。

Method: 使用恒等链接函数，基于Gini熵最大化推导出盒约束最小二乘模型，处理边界饱和问题，通过稀疏采样实现高效评估。

Result: 在33%覆盖率下获得保持集RMSE 0.117±0.008，代理排名Spearman相关系数0.972±0.015，评估次数比全密集方法减少三倍，不同评判者间排名一致性高(ρ=0.872)。

Conclusion: TVD-MI的几何特性最适合通过恒等映射来保持，这种方法为高效LLM评估提供了有效方案，并适用于其他有界响应领域。

Abstract: Pairwise comparisons of large language models using total variation distance
mutual information (TVD-MI) produce binary critic decisions per pair. We show
that averaging TVD-MI's binary trials yields centered-probability scores with
additive structure suitable for item-response theory (IRT) without nonlinear
link functions. Maximum-likelihood approaches to IRT use logistic links, but we
find empirically that these transformations introduce curvature that breaks
additivity: across three domains, the identity link yields median curl on raw
data of 0.080-0.150 (P95 = [0.474, 0.580]), whereas probit/logit introduce
substantially higher violations (median [0.245, 0.588], P95 [0.825, 2.252]). We
derive this clipped-linear model from Gini entropy maximization, yielding a
box-constrained least-squares formulation that handles boundary saturation. At
33% coverage, we achieve holdout RMSE $0.117 \pm 0.008$ while preserving agent
rankings (Spearman $\rho = 0.972 \pm 0.015$), three times fewer evaluations
than full dense. Judge robustness analysis (GPT-4o-mini vs. Llama3-70b) shows
strong agreement in agent rankings ($\rho = 0.872$) and consistent
identity-link advantage. TVD-MI's geometry is best preserved by identity
mapping for efficient LLM evaluation, applicable to other bounded-response
domains.

*Katiana Kontolati,Rini Jasmine Gladstone,Ian Davis,Ethan Pickering*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文扩展了生物信息神经网络(BINNs)用于作物基因组预测和选择，通过整合SNPs、多组学数据和先验生物知识，在仅使用基因型数据推理时显著提高预测准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基因型到表型模型精度有限，依赖大规模田间试验成本高昂。虽然结合分子表型数据可提高预测能力，但这些数据在部署时不可用。BINNs旨在克服这一限制。

Method: BINNs编码通路级归纳偏置，训练时利用多组学数据，推理时仅需基因型数据。应用于玉米基因表达和多环境田间试验数据。

Result: 在稀疏数据条件下，BINN将排序相关准确性提高达56%，非线性识别GWAS/TWAS未能发现的基因。在合成代谢组学基准测试中，相比传统神经网络减少75%预测误差。

Conclusion: BINNs建立了利用中间领域信息提高基因组预测准确性的框架，揭示非线性生物学关系，可指导基因组选择、候选基因选择、通路富集和基因编辑优先级排序。

Abstract: We extend biologically-informed neural networks (BINNs) for genomic
prediction (GP) and selection (GS) in crops by integrating thousands of
single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with multi-omics measurements and prior
biological knowledge. Traditional genotype-to-phenotype (G2P) models depend
heavily on direct mappings that achieve only modest accuracy, forcing breeders
to conduct large, costly field trials to maintain or marginally improve genetic
gain. Models that incorporate intermediate molecular phenotypes such as gene
expression can achieve higher predictive fit, but they remain impractical for
GS since such data are unavailable at deployment or design time. BINNs overcome
this limitation by encoding pathway-level inductive biases and leveraging
multi-omics data only during training, while using genotype data alone during
inference. Applied to maize gene-expression and multi-environment field-trial
data, BINN improves rank-correlation accuracy by up to 56% within and across
subpopulations under sparse-data conditions and nonlinearly identifies genes
that GWAS/TWAS fail to uncover. With complete domain knowledge for a synthetic
metabolomics benchmark, BINN reduces prediction error by 75% relative to
conventional neural nets and correctly identifies the most important nonlinear
pathway. Importantly, both cases show highly sensitive BINN latent variables
correlate with the experimental quantities they represent, despite not being
trained on them. This suggests BINNs learn biologically-relevant
representations, nonlinear or linear, from genotype to phenotype. Together,
BINNs establish a framework that leverages intermediate domain information to
improve genomic prediction accuracy and reveal nonlinear biological
relationships that can guide genomic selection, candidate gene selection,
pathway enrichment, and gene-editing prioritization.

*Hansheng Chen,Kai Zhang,Hao Tan,Leonidas Guibas,Gordon Wetzstein,Sai Bi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: π-Flow是一种基于策略的流模型，通过修改学生流模型的输出层来预测无网络策略，实现快速准确的ODE积分，避免了传统蒸馏方法中的质量-多样性权衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的少步扩散或流模型蒸馏方法存在格式不匹配问题，导致复杂的蒸馏过程经常面临质量-多样性权衡的困境。

Method: 提出策略流模型(π-Flow)，修改学生流模型的输出层来预测无网络策略，该策略能在未来子步产生动态流速度，通过模仿蒸馏方法匹配教师模型的行为。

Result: 在ImageNet 256²上达到1-NFE FID为2.85，优于相同DiT架构的MeanFlow；在FLUX.1-12B和Qwen-Image-20B上4 NFEs时，实现了比最先进少步方法更好的多样性，同时保持教师级别的质量。

Conclusion: π-Flow通过简单模仿教师行为，实现了稳定可扩展的训练，避免了质量-多样性权衡问题。

Abstract: Few-step diffusion or flow-based generative models typically distill a
velocity-predicting teacher into a student that predicts a shortcut towards
denoised data. This format mismatch has led to complex distillation procedures
that often suffer from a quality-diversity trade-off. To address this, we
propose policy-based flow models ($\pi$-Flow). $\pi$-Flow modifies the output
layer of a student flow model to predict a network-free policy at one timestep.
The policy then produces dynamic flow velocities at future substeps with
negligible overhead, enabling fast and accurate ODE integration on these
substeps without extra network evaluations. To match the policy's ODE
trajectory to the teacher's, we introduce a novel imitation distillation
approach, which matches the policy's velocity to the teacher's along the
policy's trajectory using a standard $\ell_2$ flow matching loss. By simply
mimicking the teacher's behavior, $\pi$-Flow enables stable and scalable
training and avoids the quality-diversity trade-off. On ImageNet 256$^2$, it
attains a 1-NFE FID of 2.85, outperforming MeanFlow of the same DiT
architecture. On FLUX.1-12B and Qwen-Image-20B at 4 NFEs, $\pi$-Flow achieves
substantially better diversity than state-of-the-art few-step methods, while
maintaining teacher-level quality.

TL;DR: 提出了第一个针对量子模拟优化的对角线加速器\name，通过利用哈密顿矩阵中常见的对角线结构，重新设计脉动阵列数据流，将对角线稀疏矩阵转换为密集计算，显著提升了经典哈密顿模拟的性能和能效。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 哈密顿模拟是量子计算中的关键工作负载，但希尔伯特空间维度随量子比特数指数增长，使得矩阵指数运算变得极其昂贵。现有加速器主要针对机器学习工作负载设计，其稀疏模式与哈密顿模拟中常见的结构化对角线模式存在根本差异。

Method: 利用哈密顿矩阵中常见的对角线结构，采用重新设计的脉动阵列数据流，将对角线稀疏矩阵转换为密集计算，从而提高利用率和性能。

Result: 在HamLib多样化基准测试中，\name相比SIGMA、外积算法和Gustavson算法分别实现了10.26倍、33.58倍和53.15倍的平均性能提升，峰值加速比达127.03倍，同时能耗平均降低471.55倍，最高达4630.58倍。

Conclusion: \name通过针对哈密顿模拟特有的对角线稀疏模式进行优化，显著提升了经典哈密顿模拟的可扩展性，为量子设备验证提供了高效的硬件支持。

Abstract: Hamiltonian simulation is a key workload in quantum computing, enabling the
study of complex quantum systems and serving as a critical tool for classical
verification of quantum devices. However, it is computationally challenging
because the Hilbert space dimension grows exponentially with the number of
qubits. The growing dimensions make matrix exponentiation, the key kernel in
Hamiltonian simulations, increasingly expensive. Matrix exponentiation is
typically approximated by the Taylor series, which contains a series of matrix
multiplications. Since Hermitian operators are often sparse, sparse matrix
multiplication accelerators are essential for improving the scalability of
classical Hamiltonian simulation. Yet, existing accelerators are primarily
designed for machine learning workloads and tuned to their characteristic
sparsity patterns, which differ fundamentally from those in Hamiltonian
simulations that are often dominated by structured diagonals.
  In this work, we present \name, the first diagonal-optimized quantum
simulation accelerator. It exploits the diagonal structure commonly found in
problem-Hamiltonian (Hermitian) matrices and leverages a restructured systolic
array dataflow to transform diagonally sparse matrices into dense computations,
enabling high utilization and performance. Through detailed cycle-level
simulation of diverse benchmarks in HamLib, \name{} demonstrates average
performance improvements of $10.26\times$, $33.58\times$, and $53.15\times$
over SIGMA, Outer Product, and Gustavson's algorithm, respectively, with peak
speedups up to $127.03\times$ while reducing energy consumption by an average
of $471.55\times$ and up to $4630.58\times$ compared to SIGMA.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CIM宏在深度学习加速中面临宏尺寸限制和ADC精度问题，导致吞吐量和精度瓶颈，需要优化模型适配以充分利用CIM硬件特性。

Method: 第一阶段：基于层重要性和宏尺寸约束进行模型压缩和资源重分配；第二阶段：结合部分和量化和ADC精度的量化感知训练。

Result: CIM阵列利用率提升至90%，支持256个字符线并发激活，实现93%压缩率，同时保持与现有方法相当的精度。

Conclusion: 该两阶段适配方法有效解决了CIM宏的吞吐量和精度瓶颈，为CIM加速器的高效部署提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Computing-in-Memory (CIM) macros have gained popularity for deep learning
acceleration due to their highly parallel computation and low power
consumption. However, limited macro size and ADC precision introduce throughput
and accuracy bottlenecks. This paper proposes a two-stage CIM-aware model
adaptation process. The first stage compresses the model and reallocates
resources based on layer importance and macro size constraints, reducing model
weight loading latency while improving resource utilization and maintaining
accuracy. The second stage performs quantization-aware training, incorporating
partial sum quantization and ADC precision to mitigate quantization errors in
inference. The proposed approach enhances CIM array utilization to 90\%,
enables concurrent activation of up to 256 word lines, and achieves up to 93\%
compression, all while preserving accuracy comparable to previous methods.

Motivation: 当前Transformer加速器主要关注自注意力机制的优化，但对于token长度较短的视觉Transformer，前馈网络(FFN)往往成为主要计算瓶颈，需要专门优化。

Method: 采用算法-硬件协同设计：模型复杂度通过硬件友好的动态token剪枝降低；用ReLU替换GELU激活函数；实施动态FFN2剪枝；硬件采用行向数据流和输出导向数据访问，支持动态操作。

Result: 操作量减少61.5%，FFN2权重减少59.3%，精度损失小于2%；在TSMC 28nm工艺下实现496.4K门面积和232KB SRAM缓冲器，峰值吞吐量1024 GOPS@1GHz，能效2.31 TOPS/W，面积效率858.61 GOPS/mm²。

Conclusion: 该工作展示了针对视觉Transformer中FFN瓶颈的有效优化策略，通过算法-硬件协同设计实现了高性能、低功耗的加速器设计。

Abstract: Current transformer accelerators primarily focus on optimizing self-attention
due to its quadratic complexity. However, this focus is less relevant for
vision transformers with short token lengths, where the Feed-Forward Network
(FFN) tends to be the dominant computational bottleneck. This paper presents a
low power Vision Transformer accelerator, optimized through algorithm-hardware
co-design. The model complexity is reduced using hardware-friendly dynamic
token pruning without introducing complex mechanisms. Sparsity is further
improved by replacing GELU with ReLU activations and employing dynamic FFN2
pruning, achieving a 61.5\% reduction in operations and a 59.3\% reduction in
FFN2 weights, with an accuracy loss of less than 2\%. The hardware adopts a
row-wise dataflow with output-oriented data access to eliminate data
transposition, and supports dynamic operations with minimal area overhead.
Implemented in TSMC's 28nm CMOS technology, our design occupies 496.4K gates
and includes a 232KB SRAM buffer, achieving a peak throughput of 1024 GOPS at
1GHz, with an energy efficiency of 2.31 TOPS/W and an area efficiency of 858.61
GOPS/mm2.

TL;DR: 发现DRAM芯片中新的列干扰现象ColumnDisturb，通过重复打开或保持某行激活状态，可干扰共享相同列的DRAM单元，影响范围可达三个子阵列的3072行，比RowHammer/RowPress影响范围更大。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 揭示DRAM芯片中存在的广泛读干扰现象，该现象影响所有主要制造商的芯片，且随着技术节点缩小而恶化，对现有DRAM刷新机制构成严重威胁。

Method: 使用216个DDR4和4个HBM2芯片进行实验，在多种操作条件下严格表征ColumnDisturb特性，获得27个关键实验观察结果。

Result: ColumnDisturb在标准DDR4刷新窗口内即可引发多位翻转，影响行数比保留故障多198倍，显著降低了基于保留时间异质性的刷新机制的有效性。

Conclusion: ColumnDisturb是DRAM技术缩放过程中日益严重的问题，对未来的DRAM设计和刷新机制提出了重大挑战，需要新的缓解策略。

Abstract: We experimentally demonstrate a new widespread read disturbance phenomenon,
ColumnDisturb, in real commodity DRAM chips. By repeatedly opening or keeping a
DRAM row (aggressor row) open, we show that it is possible to disturb DRAM
cells through a DRAM column (i.e., bitline) and induce bitflips in DRAM cells
sharing the same columns as the aggressor row (across multiple DRAM subarrays).
With ColumnDisturb, the activation of a single row concurrently disturbs cells
across as many as three subarrays (e.g., 3072 rows) as opposed to
RowHammer/RowPress, which affect only a few neighboring rows of the aggressor
row in a single subarray. We rigorously characterize ColumnDisturb and its
characteristics under various operational conditions using 216 DDR4 and 4 HBM2
chips from three major manufacturers. Among our 27 key experimental
observations, we highlight two major results and their implications.
  First, ColumnDisturb affects chips from all three major manufacturers and
worsens as DRAM technology scales down to smaller node sizes (e.g., the minimum
time to induce the first ColumnDisturb bitflip reduces by up to 5.06x). We
observe that, in existing DRAM chips, ColumnDisturb induces bitflips within a
standard DDR4 refresh window (e.g., in 63.6 ms) in multiple cells. We predict
that, as DRAM technology node size reduces, ColumnDisturb would worsen in
future DRAM chips, likely causing many more bitflips in the standard refresh
window. Second, ColumnDisturb induces bitflips in many (up to 198x) more rows
than retention failures. Therefore, ColumnDisturb has strong implications for
retention-aware refresh mechanisms that leverage the heterogeneity in cell
retention times: our detailed analyses show that ColumnDisturb greatly reduces
the benefits of such mechanisms.

Motivation: 研究在调度器只能间歇性访问队列状态信息的情况下，如何设计稳定的负载均衡策略，并分析其在重负载下的性能表现。

Method: 考虑一类广义策略，调度器基于最近访问时的缩放队列长度顺序和服务器处理速率进行调度决策，建立稳定性条件和重负载延迟最优性条件。

Result: 提出了易于验证的系统稳定性充要条件，以及重负载延迟最优性的充分条件，证明在重负载下队列长度收敛到缩放确定性向量。

Conclusion: 该研究为间歇性状态信息下的负载均衡系统提供了理论分析框架，证明了在适当条件下系统仍能保持稳定和延迟最优。

Abstract: We consider a load balancing system consisting of $n$ single-server queues
working in parallel, with heterogeneous service rates. Jobs arrive to a central
dispatcher, which has to dispatch them to one of the queues immediately upon
arrival. For this setting, we consider a broad family of policies where the
dispatcher can only access the queue lengths sporadically, every $T$ units of
time. We assume that the dispatching decisions are made based only on the order
of the scaled queue lengths at the last time that the queues were accessed, and
on the processing rate of each server. For these general policies, we provide
easily verifiable necessary and sufficient conditions for the stability of the
system, and sufficient conditions for heavy-traffic delay optimality. We also
show that, in heavy-traffic, the queue length converges in distribution to a
scaled deterministic vector, where the scaling factor is an exponential random
variable.
