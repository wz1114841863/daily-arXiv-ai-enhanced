Using the predicted times,\nthe second technique generates optimal execution plans for the machines by\ndrawing inspiration from the flexible job shop scheduling problem. The plans\nare executed via careful synchronization across different machines.

To evaluate this approach, we assessed both the point and\nprobabilistic prediction performance of KpR, using the TabPFN model across six\nfieldscale datasets from LimeSoDa. These datasets included soil organic carbon,\nclay content, and pH, along with features derived from remote sensing and\nin-situ proximal soil sensing. KpR with TabPFN demonstrated reliable\nuncertainty estimates and more accurate predictions in comparison to several\nother spatial techniques (e.g., regression/residual kriging with TabPFN), as\nwell as to established non-spatial machine learning algorithms (e.g., random\nforest).

This\nimprovement was due to the strong prediction performance of the TabPFN\nalgorithm itself and the complementary spatial information provided by KpR\nfeatures.

We leverage Prototypical Networks with spectrogram\nrepresentations of cough sounds to address the challenge of limited labeled\ndata. Our study evaluates whether few-shot learning can enable models to\nachieve performance comparable to traditional deep learning approaches while\nusing significantly fewer training samples. Additionally, we compare\nmulti-class and binary classification models to assess whether multi-class\nmodels can perform comparably to their binary counterparts. Experimental\nfindings show that few-shot learning models can achieve competitive accuracy.\nOur model attains 74.87% accuracy in multi-class classification with only 15\nsupport examples per class, while binary classification achieves over 70%\naccuracy across all class pairs. Class-wise analysis reveals Flu as the most\ndistinguishable class, and Healthy as the most challenging. Statistical tests\n(paired t-test p = 0.149, Wilcoxon p = 0.125) indicate no significant\nperformance difference between binary and multiclass models, supporting the\nviability of multi-class classification in this setting. These results\nhighlight the feasibility of applying few-shot learning in medical diagnostics,\nparticularly when large labeled datasets are unavailable."}

We demonstrate through extensive numerical experiments that\nProDiGy outperforms existing defenses in various scenarios. In particular, when\nthe clients' data do not follow an IID distribution, while other defense\nmechanisms fail, ProDiGy maintains strong defense capabilities and model\naccuracy. These findings highlight the effectiveness of a dual perspective\napproach that promotes natural similarity among honest clients while detecting\nsuspicious uniformity as a potential indicator of an attack."}

Most existing\nunsupervised methods embed node features into latent representations to enable\ncross-graph comparison without ground-truth correspondences. However, these\nmethods suffer from two critical limitations: the degradation of node\ndistinctiveness due to oversmoothing in GNN-based embeddings, and the\nmisalignment of latent spaces across graphs caused by structural noise, feature\nheterogeneity, and training instability, ultimately leading to unreliable node\ncorrespondences. We propose a novel graph alignment framework that\nsimultaneously enhances node distinctiveness and enforces geometric consistency\nacross latent spaces. Our approach introduces a dual-pass encoder that combines\nlow-pass and high-pass spectral filters to generate embeddings that are both\nstructure-aware and highly discriminative. To address latent space\nmisalignment, we incorporate a geometry-aware functional map module that learns\nbijective and isometric transformations between graph embeddings, ensuring\nconsistent geometric relationships across different representations. Extensive\nexperiments on graph benchmarks demonstrate that our method consistently\noutperforms existing unsupervised alignment baselines, exhibiting superior\nrobustness to structural inconsistencies and challenging alignment scenarios.\nAdditionally, comprehensive evaluation on vision-language benchmarks using\ndiverse pretrained models shows that our framework effectively generalizes\nbeyond graph domains, enabling unsupervised alignment of vision and language\nrepresentations."}

While\ndetecting this drift is a well-studied topic, explaining how and why the\nmodel's decision-making logic changes still remains a significant challenge. In\nthis paper, we introduce a novel methodology to explain concept drift by\nanalyzing the temporal evolution of group-based counterfactual explanations\n(GCEs). Our approach tracks shifts in the GCEs' cluster centroids and their\nassociated counterfactual action vectors before and after a drift. These\nevolving GCEs act as an interpretable proxy, revealing structural changes in\nthe model's decision boundary and its underlying rationale. We operationalize\nthis analysis within a three-layer framework that synergistically combines\ninsights from the data layer (distributional shifts), the model layer\n(prediction disagreement), and our proposed explanation layer. We show that\nsuch holistic view allows for a more comprehensive diagnosis of drift, making\nit possible to distinguish between different root causes, such as a spatial\ndata shift versus a re-labeling of concepts."}

This work proposes\ndeveloping molecule representations using the concept of Functional Groups (FG)\nin chemistry. We introduce the Functional Group Representation (FGR) framework,\na novel approach to encoding molecules based on their fundamental chemical\nsubstructures. Our method integrates two types of functional groups: those\ncurated from established chemical knowledge (FG), and those mined from a large\nmolecular corpus using sequential pattern mining (MFG). The resulting FGR\nframework encodes molecules into a lower-dimensional latent space by leveraging\npre-training on a large dataset of unlabeled molecules. Furthermore, the\nproposed framework allows the inclusion of 2D structure-based descriptors of\nmolecules. We demonstrate that the FGR framework achieves state-of-the-art\nperformance on a diverse range of 33 benchmark datasets spanning physical\nchemistry, biophysics, quantum mechanics, biological activity, and\npharmacokinetics while enabling chemical interpretability.

Quantization reduces memory through lower\nnumerical precision, but extreme 2-bit quantization suffers from catastrophic\nperformance loss due to outliers in activations. Rotation-based methods such as\nQuIP and QuaRot apply orthogonal transforms to eliminate outliers before\nquantization, using computational invariance: $\\mathbf{y} = \\mathbf{Wx} =\n(\\mathbf{WQ}^T)(\\mathbf{Qx})$ for orthogonal $\\mathbf{Q}$. However, these\nmethods use fixed transforms--Hadamard matrices achieving optimal worst-case\ncoherence $\\mu = 1/\\sqrt{n}$--that cannot adapt to specific weight\ndistributions. We identify that different transformer layers exhibit distinct\noutlier patterns, motivating layer-adaptive rotations rather than\none-size-fits-all approaches. We propose ButterflyQuant, which replaces\nHadamard rotations with learnable butterfly transforms parameterized by\ncontinuous Givens rotation angles. Unlike Hadamard's discrete $\\{+1, -1\\}$\nentries that are non-differentiable and prohibit gradient-based learning,\nbutterfly transforms' continuous parameterization enables smooth optimization\nwhile guaranteeing orthogonality by construction. This orthogonal constraint\nensures theoretical guarantees in outlier suppression while achieving $O(n \\log\nn)$ computational complexity with only $\\frac{n \\log n}{2}$ learnable\nparameters. We further introduce a uniformity regularization on\npost-transformation activations to promote smoother distributions amenable to\nquantization. Learning requires only 128 calibration samples and converges in\nminutes on a single GPU--a negligible one-time cost. On LLaMA-2-7B with 2-bit\nquantization, ButterflyQuant achieves 15.4 perplexity versus 22.1 for QuaRot."}
