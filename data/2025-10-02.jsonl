However, for practical\nproblems, obtaining large quantities of reward labels is often infeasible due\nto computational or financial constraints, particularly when relying on human\nfeedback.

We\nformalize this problem of reward selection for reinforcement learning from\nlimited feedback (RLLF), introducing a new problem formulation that facilitates\nthe study of strategies for selecting impactful rewards. Two types of selection\nstrategies are investigated: (i) heuristics that rely on reward-free\ninformation such as state visitation and partial value functions, and (ii)\nstrategies pre-trained using auxiliary evaluative feedback.

(2) Mechanism: the model encodes long-range dependencies using\nattention to construct a directed acyclic graph to ``cache'' and ``retrieve''\npairwise partial products.

With these\ninsights, we revisit the learning dynamics of standard fine-tuning and find\nthat the model converges to a local optimum that lacks the required long-range\ndependencies.

We achieve this by minimizing the\ndistributional mismatch between noised samples from the true conditional\ndistribution and samples from the guided diffusion process. We extend our\nframework to reward guided sampling, enabling the model to target distributions\ntilted by a reward function $R(x_0,c)$, defined on clean data and a\nconditioning $c$. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our methodology on\nlow-dimensional toy examples and high-dimensional image settings, where we\nobserve improvements in Fr\\'echet inception distance (FID) for image\ngeneration. In text-to-image applications, we observe that employing a reward\nfunction given by the CLIP score leads to guidance weights that improve\nimage-prompt alignment."}

However, the optimization stability of policy gradients in this setting\nremains understudied. As a result, existing implementations often resort to\nconservative hyperparameter choices to ensure stability, which requires more\ntraining samples and increases computational costs. Hence, developing models\nfor reliably tracking the underlying optimization dynamics and leveraging them\ninto training enables more sample-efficient regimes and further unleashes\nscalable post-training. We address this gap by formalizing the stochastic\noptimization problem of policy gradients with explicit consideration of\nsecond-order geometry. We propose a tractable computational framework that\ntracks and leverages curvature information during policy updates. We further\nemploy this framework to design interventions in the optimization process\nthrough data selection. The resultant algorithm, Curvature-Aware Policy\nOptimization (CAPO), identifies samples that contribute to unstable updates and\nmasks them out. Theoretically, we establish monotonic improvement guarantees\nunder realistic assumptions. On standard math reasoning benchmarks, we\nempirically show that CAPO ensures stable updates under aggressive learning\nregimes where baselines catastrophically fail.

First, we find that the improvements\narise from a redistribution of activations in the LLM's MLP layers, where near\nzero activations become less frequent while large magnitude activations\nincrease. This redistribution enhances the model's representational capacity by\nsuppressing weak signals and promoting stronger, more informative ones.\nBuilding on this insight, we propose the Activation Redistribution Module\n(ARM), a lightweight inference-time technique that modifies activations\ndirectly without altering the input sequence. ARM adaptively identifies\nnear-zero activations after the non-linear function and shifts them outward,\nimplicitly reproducing the beneficial effects of meaningless tokens in a\ncontrolled manner. Extensive experiments across diverse benchmarks and model\narchitectures clearly show that ARM consistently improves LLM performance on\nreasoning tasks while requiring only a few lines of simple code to implement.\nOur findings deliver both a clear mechanistic explanation for the unexpected\nbenefits of meaningless tokens and a simple yet effective technique that\nharnesses activation redistribution to further improve LLM performance."}

When\nno ground-truth trajectories are available, but one has only snapshots of data\ntaken at discrete time steps, the problem of modelling the dynamics, and thus\ninferring the underlying trajectories, can be solved by multi-marginal\ngeneralisations of flow matching algorithms. This paper proposes a novel flow\nmatching method that overcomes the limitations of existing multi-marginal\ntrajectory inference algorithms. Our proposed method, ALI-CFM, uses a\nGAN-inspired adversarial loss to fit neurally parametrised interpolant curves\nbetween source and target points such that the marginal distributions at\nintermediate time points are close to the observed distributions. The resulting\ninterpolants are smooth trajectories that, as we show, are unique under mild\nassumptions. These interpolants are subsequently marginalised by a flow\nmatching algorithm, yielding a trained vector field for the underlying\ndynamics. We showcase the versatility and scalability of our method by\noutperforming the existing baselines on spatial transcriptomics and cell\ntracking datasets, while performing on par with them on single-cell trajectory\nprediction.\n  Code: https://github.com/mmacosha/adversarially-learned-interpolants."}

We revisit this challenge and uncover a prosperity-before-collapse\nphenomenon: stale data can be as informative as on-policy data if exploited\nproperly. Building on this insight, we introduce M2PO (Second-Moment Trust\nPolicy Optimization), which constrains the second moment of importance weights\nto suppress only extreme outliers while preserving informative updates.\nNotably, M2PO sharply reduces the fraction of clipped tokens under high\nstaleness (from 1.22% to 0.06% over training), precisely masking high-variance\ntokens while maintaining stable optimization. Extensive evaluation across six\nmodels (from 1.7B to 32B) and eight benchmarks shows that M2PO delivers stable\noff-policy training even with data stale by at least 256 model updates and\nmatches on-policy performance."}

In this work, we investigate a complementary paradigm for\nscaling RL, BroR-Lincreasing the number of rollouts per example to hundreds to\nexhaustively Broaden exploration, which yields continuous performance gains\nbeyond the saturation point observed in ProRL when scaling the number of\ntraining steps. Our approach is motivated by a mass balance equation analysis\nallowing us to characterize the rate of change in probability mass for correct\nand incorrect tokens during the reinforcement process. We show that under a\none-step RL assumption, sampled rollout tokens always contribute to\ncorrect-mass expansion, while unsampled tokens outside rollouts may lead to\ngains or losses depending on their distribution and the net reward balance.\nImportantly, as the number of rollouts per example N increases, the effect of\nunsampled terms diminishes, ensuring overall correct-mass expansion. To\nvalidate our theoretical analysis, we conduct simulations under more relaxed\nconditions and find that a sufficiently large rollout size N-corresponding to\nample exploration-guarantees an increase in the probability mass of all correct\ntokens.
