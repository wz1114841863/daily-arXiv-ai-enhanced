To address the issue, one effective and well studied technique is cache prefetching. Many prefetching designs have been proposed, with varying approaches and effectiveness. For example, SPP is a popular prefetcher that leverages confidence throttled recursion to speculate on the future path of program's references, however it is very susceptible to the reference reordering of higher-level caches and the OoO core. Orthogonally, AMPM is another popular approach to prefetching which uses reordering-resistant access maps to identify patterns within a region, but is unable to speculate beyond that region. In this paper, we propose SPPAM, a new approach to prefetching, inspired by prior works such as SPP and AMPM, while addressing their limitations. SPPAM utilizes online-learning to build a set of access-map patterns. These patterns are used in a speculative lookahead which is throttled by a confidence metric.

Quantization is an effective solution, with INT weights and FP activations being widely adopted to preserve accuracy. Prior works further reduce FP overhead by using block floating point (BFP) activations in linear layers, but fail to extend BFP to attention layers due to severe accuracy degradation, limiting overall efficiency. To address this challenge, we propose Harmonia, an algorithm-hardware co-design framework that enables all-layer BFP activations with a configurable hardware architecture. First, we systematically explore BFP configurations to achieve a better trade-off between accuracy and activation compression across all layers. Second, to reduce KV-cache storage and computation in attention layers, we introduce an asymmetric bit-allocation strategy and computations in attention layers,we introduce an asymmetric bit-allocation strategy combined with a hybrid offline-online outlier smoothing technique. This allow aggressive KV-cache compression from FP16 to 4-bit-mantissa BFP with only 0.3% average accuracy loss. Third, to fully exploit all-layer BFP activations, we design dedicated hardware components, including a reconfigurable PE supporting mixed data formats (BFP-INT and BPF-BFP), a real-time FP16-to-BFP converter, and a tiling-aware dataflow to reduce memory traffic. We evaluate Harmonia on GEMM operations in both linear and attention layers across eight widely used LLMs. Compared with prior works, Harmonia achieves 3.84x (up to 5.05x) higher area efficiency, 2.03x (up to 3.90x) better energy efficiency, and 3.08x (up to 4.62x) speedup on average.", "AI": {"tldr": "Harmonia\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u7b97\u6cd5-\u786c\u4ef6\u534f\u540c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5168\u5c42BFP\u6fc0\u6d3b\u3001\u975e\u5bf9\u79f0\u4f4d\u5206\u914d\u7b56\u7565\u548c\u4e13\u7528\u786c\u4ef6\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347LLM\u63a8\u7406\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u867d\u7136\u5f3a\u5927\u4f46\u5185\u5b58\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u91cf\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u7ebf\u6027\u5c42\u4f7f\u7528BFP\u6fc0\u6d3b\uff0c\u4f46\u65e0\u6cd5\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5c42\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e25\u91cd\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u6574\u4f53\u6548\u7387\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "method": "1) \u7cfb\u7edf\u63a2\u7d22BFP\u914d\u7f6e\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u5168\u5c42\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0e\u6fc0\u6d3b\u538b\u7f29\u7684\u5e73\u8861\uff1b2) \u5f15\u5165\u975e\u5bf9\u79f0\u4f4d\u5206\u914d\u7b56\u7565\u548c\u6df7\u5408\u79bb\u7ebf-\u5728\u7ebf\u5f02\u5e38\u503c\u5e73\u6ed1\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5c06KV\u7f13\u5b58\u4eceFP16\u538b\u7f29\u52304\u4f4d\u5c3e\u6570BFP\uff1b3) \u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e13\u7528\u786c\u4ef6\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u652f\u6301\u6df7\u5408\u6570\u636e\u683c\u5f0f\u7684\u53ef\u91cd\u6784PE\u3001\u5b9e\u65f6FP16\u5230BFP\u8f6c\u6362\u5668\u548c\u5206\u5757\u611f\u77e5\u6570\u636e\u6d41\u3002", "result": "\u57288\u4e2a\u5e7f\u6cdb\u4f7f\u7528\u7684LLM\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u5148\u524d\u5de5\u4f5c\uff0cHarmonia\u5e73\u5747\u5b9e\u73b03.84\u500d\uff08\u6700\u9ad85.05\u500d\uff09\u7684\u9762\u79ef\u6548\u7387\u30012.03\u500d\uff08\u6700\u9ad83.90\u500d\uff09\u7684\u80fd\u6548\u548c3.08\u500d\uff08\u6700\u9ad84.62\u500d\uff09\u7684\u52a0\u901f\u3002", "conclusion": "Harmonia\u6210\u529f\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5c42BFP\u6fc0\u6d3b\u7684\u7cbe\u5ea6\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7b97\u6cd5-\u786c\u4ef6\u534f\u540c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5168\u5c42BFP\u6fc0\u6d3b\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86LLM\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u6548\u7387\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

Shen", "Di Wu"], "title": "A-Graph: A Unified Graph Representation for At-Will Simulation across System Stacks", "comment": null, "summary": "As computer systems continue to diversify across technologies, architectures, applications, and beyond, the relevant design space has become larger and more complex. Given such trends, design space exploration (DSE) at early stages is critical to ensure agile development towards optimal performance and cost. Industry-grade EDA tools directly take in RTL code and report accurate results, but do not perform DSE. Recent works have attempted to explore the design space via simulation. However, most of these works are domain-specific and constrain the space that users are allowed to explore, offering limited flexibility between technologies, architecture, and applications. Moreover, they often demand high domain expertise to ensure high accuracy. To enable simulation that is agnostic to technology, architecture, and application at any granularity, we introduce Architecture-Graph (Agraph), a graph that unifies the system representation surrounding any arbitrary application, software, architecture, and circuit. Such a unified representation distinguishes Agraph from prior works, which focus on a single stack, allowing users to freely explore the design space across system stacks. To fully unleash the potential of Agraph, we further present Archx, a framework that implements Agraph. Archx is user-friendly in two ways. First, Archx has an easy-to-use programming interface to automatically generate and sweep design points under user constraints, boosting the programmability.

Motivated by the observation that commuting operations can be executed in parallel, we introduce conflict-obstruction-freedom: a process is guaranteed to complete its operation if it runs for long enough without encountering step contention with conflicting (non-commuting) operations. This condition generalizes obstruction-freedom and wait-freedom by allowing progress as long as step contention is only induced by commuting operations. We prove that conflict-obstruction-free universal constructions are impossible to implement in the asynchronous read-write shared memory model. This result exposes a fundamental limitation of conflict-aware universal constructions: the mere invocation of conflicting operations imposes a synchronization cost.

Both experimentally demonstrated and simulated logic designs are critically examined, highlighting key challenges in reliability and the role of device-level optimization in enabling scalable and commercial viable PIM systems. The review begins with an overview of relevant logic families, memristive device types, and associated reliability metrics. Each logic family is then explored in terms of how it capitalizes on distinct device properties to implement logic techniques.

Such memorization raises serious privacy concerns, motivating the widespread adoption of differentially private training algorithms such as DP-SGD. However, a growing body of empirical work shows that DP-SGD often leads to suboptimal generalization performance, particularly on long-tailed data that contain a large number of rare or atypical samples. Despite these observations, a theoretical understanding of this phenomenon remains largely unexplored, and existing differential privacy analysis are difficult to extend to the nonconvex and nonsmooth neural networks commonly used in practice. In this work, we develop the first theoretical framework for analyzing DP-SGD on long-tailed data from a feature learning perspective.

Many open and proprietary stacks still execute LDPC on general-purpose CPUs, raising concerns about missed-slot events and limited scalability as bandwidths, modulation orders, and user multiplexing increase. This paper empirically quantifies the benefit of offloading 5G-style LDPC5G decoding from a Grace CPU to the integrated Blackwell GB10 GPU on an NVIDIA DGX~Spark platform. Using NVIDIA Sionna PHY/SYS on TensorFlow, we construct an NR-like link-level chain with an LDPC5G encoder/decoder, 16-QAM modulation, and AWGN, and sweep both the number of codewords decoded in parallel and the number of belief-propagation iterations, timing only the decoding phase while logging CPU and GPU utilization and power. Across the sweep we observe an average GPU/CPU throughput speedup of approximately $6\\times$, with per-codeword CPU latency reaching $\\approx 0.71$\\,ms at 20 iterations (exceeding the 0.5\\,ms slot), while the GB10 GPU remains within 6--24\\% of the slot for the same workloads. Resource-usage measurements show that CPU-based LDPC decoding often consumes around ten Grace cores, whereas GPU-based decoding adds only $\\approx10-15$\\,W over GPU idle while leaving most CPU capacity available for higher-layer tasks. Because our implementation relies on high-level Sionna layers rather than hand-tuned CUDA, these results represent conservative lower bounds on achievable accelerator performance and provide a reusable, scriptable methodology for evaluating LDPC and other physical-layer kernels on future Grace/Blackwell and Aerial/ACAR/AODT platforms.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5b9e\u8bc1\u91cf\u5316\u4e86\u5c065G LDPC\u89e3\u7801\u4eceGrace CPU\u5378\u8f7d\u5230Blackwell GB10 GPU\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u5728DGX Spark\u5e73\u53f0\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u7ea66\u500d\u7684\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u52a0\u901f\uff0cGPU\u89e3\u7801\u5ef6\u8fdf\u4fdd\u6301\u57280.5ms\u65f6\u9699\u5185\uff0c\u800cCPU\u89e3\u7801\u4f1a\u8d85\u65f6\u3002", "motivation": "5G NR\u7269\u7406\u5c42\u4e2d\u7684LDPC\u89e3\u7801\u662f\u8ba1\u7b97\u5bc6\u96c6\u578b\u6838\u5fc3\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u5fc5\u987b\u57280.5ms\u4f20\u8f93\u65f6\u95f4\u95f4\u9694\u5185\u5b8c\u6210\u3002\u8bb8\u591a\u73b0\u6709\u7cfb\u7edf\u4ecd\u5728\u901a\u7528CPU\u4e0a\u6267\u884cLDPC\u89e3\u7801\uff0c\u968f\u7740\u5e26\u5bbd\u3001\u8c03\u5236\u9636\u6570\u548c\u7528\u6237\u590d\u7528\u7684\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u65f6\u9699\u9519\u8fc7\u548c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u53d7\u9650\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528NVIDIA Sionna PHY/SYS\u5728TensorFlow\u4e0a\u6784\u5efaNR-like\u94fe\u8def\u7ea7\u94fe\uff0c\u5305\u542bLDPC5G\u7f16\u7801\u5668/\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u300116-QAM\u8c03\u5236\u548cAWGN\u4fe1\u9053\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u626b\u63cf\u5e76\u884c\u89e3\u7801\u7684\u7801\u5b57\u6570\u91cf\u548c\u7f6e\u4fe1\u4f20\u64ad\u8fed\u4ee3\u6b21\u6570\uff0c\u6d4b\u91cf\u89e3\u7801\u9636\u6bb5\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u8bb0\u5f55CPU\u548cGPU\u7684\u5229\u7528\u7387\u548c\u529f\u8017\u3002", "result": "GPU\u76f8\u6bd4CPU\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u7ea66\u500d\u7684\u5e73\u5747\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u52a0\u901f\u3002CPU\u89e3\u7801\u5ef6\u8fdf\u572820\u6b21\u8fed\u4ee3\u65f6\u8fbe\u5230\u7ea60.71ms\uff08\u8d85\u8fc70.5ms\u65f6\u9699\uff09\uff0c\u800cGB10 GPU\u5728\u76f8\u540c\u5de5\u4f5c\u8d1f\u8f7d\u4e0b\u4fdd\u6301\u5728\u65f6\u9699\u76846-24%\u8303\u56f4\u5185\u3002CPU\u89e3\u7801\u901a\u5e38\u6d88\u8017\u7ea610\u4e2aGrace\u6838\u5fc3\uff0c\u800cGPU\u89e3\u7801\u4ec5\u6bd4\u7a7a\u95f2\u72b6\u6001\u589e\u52a010-15W\u529f\u8017\u3002", "conclusion": "GPU\u5378\u8f7d\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347LDPC\u89e3\u7801\u6027\u80fd\u5e76\u6ee1\u8db3\u65f6\u9699\u8981\u6c42\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u91ca\u653eCPU\u8d44\u6e90\u7528\u4e8e\u66f4\u9ad8\u5c42\u4efb\u52a1\u3002\u7531\u4e8e\u4f7f\u7528\u9ad8\u5c42Sionna\u800c\u975e\u624b\u52a8\u4f18\u5316\u7684CUDA\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7ed3\u679c\u662f\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u7684\u52a0\u901f\u5668\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u4fdd\u5b88\u4e0b\u9650\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u5e73\u53f0\u4e0a\u7684\u7269\u7406\u5c42\u5185\u6838\u8bc4\u4f30\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u91cd\u7528\u3001\u53ef\u811a\u672c\u5316\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

The integration of autonomous vehicles (AVs) into transportation systems has introduced critical safety concerns, particularly regarding driver re-engagement during mode transitions. Past accidents underscore the risks of overreliance on automation and highlight the need to understand dynamic attention allocation to support safety in autonomous driving. A high-fidelity driving simulation was conducted. Eye-tracking technology was used to measure fixation duration, fixation count, and time to first fixation across distinct driving modes (automated, manual, and transition), which were then used to assess how drivers allocated attention to various areas of interest (AOIs). Findings show that drivers' attention varies significantly across driving modes. In manual mode, attention consistently focuses on the road, while in automated mode, prolonged fixation on the embedded HMI was observed. During the handover and takeover phases, attention shifts dynamically between environmental and technological elements. The study reveals that driver attention allocation is mode-dependent. These findings inform the design of adaptive HMIs in AVs that align with drivers' attention patterns. By presenting relevant information according to the driving context, such systems can enhance driver-vehicle interaction, support effective transitions, and improve overall safety. Systematic analysis of visual attention dynamics across driving modes is gaining prominence, as it informs adaptive HMI designs and driver readiness interventions. The GLMM findings can be directly applied to the design of adaptive HMIs or driver training programs to enhance attention and improve safety.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u4e2d\u9a7e\u9a76\u5458\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u9a7e\u9a76\u6a21\u5f0f\uff08\u81ea\u52a8\u3001\u624b\u52a8\u3001\u8fc7\u6e21\uff09\u4e0b\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u5206\u914d\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6a21\u5f0f\u968f\u9a7e\u9a76\u6a21\u5f0f\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u4e3a\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u4eba\u673a\u754c\u9762\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4f9d\u636e\u3002", "motivation": "\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u8f66\u8f86\u5f15\u5165\u4ea4\u901a\u7cfb\u7edf\u5e26\u6765\u5b89\u5168\u62c5\u5fe7\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u6a21\u5f0f\u8f6c\u6362\u65f6\u9a7e\u9a76\u5458\u91cd\u65b0\u53c2\u4e0e\u7684\u98ce\u9669\u3002\u8fc7\u5f80\u4e8b\u6545\u663e\u793a\u8fc7\u5ea6\u4f9d\u8d56\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u7684\u5371\u9669\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u7406\u89e3\u52a8\u6001\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5206\u914d\u4ee5\u652f\u6301\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u5b89\u5168\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u9a7e\u9a76\u6a21\u62df\u548c\u773c\u52a8\u8ffd\u8e2a\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u6d4b\u91cf\u4e0d\u540c\u9a7e\u9a76\u6a21\u5f0f\uff08\u81ea\u52a8\u3001\u624b\u52a8\u3001\u8fc7\u6e21\uff09\u4e0b\u7684\u6ce8\u89c6\u6301\u7eed\u65f6\u95f4\u3001\u6ce8\u89c6\u6b21\u6570\u548c\u9996\u6b21\u6ce8\u89c6\u65f6\u95f4\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u9a7e\u9a76\u5458\u5bf9\u4e0d\u540c\u5174\u8da3\u533a\u57df\u7684\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5206\u914d\u3002", "result": "\u9a7e\u9a76\u5458\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u9a7e\u9a76\u6a21\u5f0f\u4e0b\u663e\u8457\u53d8\u5316\uff1a\u624b\u52a8\u6a21\u5f0f\u4e0b\u6301\u7eed\u5173\u6ce8\u9053\u8def\uff1b\u81ea\u52a8\u6a21\u5f0f\u4e0b\u957f\u65f6\u95f4\u6ce8\u89c6\u5d4c\u5165\u5f0fHMI\uff1b\u4ea4\u63a5\u548c\u63a5\u7ba1\u9636\u6bb5\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5728\u73af\u5883\u548c\u6280\u672f\u5143\u7d20\u95f4\u52a8\u6001\u5207\u6362\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9a7e\u9a76\u5458\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5206\u914d\u662f\u6a21\u5f0f\u4f9d\u8d56\u7684\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u53d1\u73b0\u4e3a\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7b26\u5408\u9a7e\u9a76\u5458\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94HMI\u63d0\u4f9b\u4fe1\u606f\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u6839\u636e\u9a7e\u9a76\u60c5\u5883\u5448\u73b0\u76f8\u5173\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u589e\u5f3a\u9a7e\u9a76\u5458-\u8f66\u8f86\u4ea4\u4e92\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u6709\u6548\u8fc7\u6e21\u5e76\u63d0\u9ad8\u6574\u4f53\u5b89\u5168\u3002"}}

At inference time, we invert the same trained network to generate structure candidates from a spectrum code, which explicitly represents the one-to-many nature of spectrum-to-structure inference. On a filtered subset, the model is numerically invertible on trained examples, achieves spectrum-code prediction above chance, and produces coarse but meaningful structural signals when inverted on validation spectra. These results demonstrate that invertible architectures can unify spectrum prediction and uncertainty-aware candidate generation within one end-to-end model.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u7528\u4e8e13C NMR\u7684\u53ef\u9006\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u5355\u4e00\u6761\u4ef6\u53ef\u9006\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u5b9e\u73b0\u5206\u5b50\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0e\u5149\u8c31\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u53cc\u5411\u6620\u5c04", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u9700\u8981\u5206\u522b\u8bad\u7ec3\u6b63\u5411\uff08\u7ed3\u6784\u5230\u5149\u8c31\uff09\u548c\u9006\u5411\uff08\u5149\u8c31\u5230\u7ed3\u6784\uff09\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u7edf\u4e00\u5904\u7406\u5149\u8c31\u9884\u6d4b\u548c\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u5019\u9009\u7ed3\u6784\u751f\u6210", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8ei-RevNet\u98ce\u683c\u7684\u53cc\u5c04\u5757\u6784\u5efa\u6761\u4ef6\u53ef\u9006\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u4ece\u56fe\u7ed3\u6784\u7f16\u7801\u9884\u6d4b128\u4f4d\u5206\u7bb1\u5149\u8c31\u4ee3\u7801\uff0c\u5269\u4f59\u6f5c\u5728\u7ef4\u5ea6\u6355\u83b7\u6b8b\u5dee\u53d8\u5f02\u6027", "result": "\u5728\u8fc7\u6ee4\u5b50\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u793a\u4f8b\u4e0a\u6570\u503c\u53ef\u9006\uff0c\u5149\u8c31\u4ee3\u7801\u9884\u6d4b\u4f18\u4e8e\u968f\u673a\uff0c\u5728\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5149\u8c31\u4e0a\u9006\u5411\u751f\u6210\u7c97\u7cd9\u4f46\u6709\u610f\u4e49\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u4fe1\u53f7", "conclusion": "\u53ef\u9006\u67b6\u6784\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u5355\u4e00\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7edf\u4e00\u5149\u8c31\u9884\u6d4b\u548c\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u5019\u9009\u7ed3\u6784\u751f\u6210"}}

While most process mining efforts focus on intra-organizational scenarios, many real-world business processes span multiple independent organizations. Inter-organizational process mining, though, faces significant challenges, particularly regarding confidentiality guarantees: The analysis of data can reveal information that the participating organizations may not consent to disclose to one another, or to a third party hosting process mining services. To overcome this issue, this paper presents CONFINE, an approach for secrecy-preserving inter-organizational process mining. CONFINE leverages Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) to deploy trusted applications that are capable of securely mining multi-party event logs while preserving data secrecy. We propose an architecture supporting a four-stage protocol to secure data exchange and processing, allowing for protected transfer and aggregation of unaltered process data across organizational boundaries. To avoid out-of-memory errors due to the limited capacity of TEEs, our protocol employs a segmentation-based strategy, whereby event logs are transmitted to TEEs in smaller batches. We conduct a formal verification of correctness and a security analysis of the guarantees provided by the TEE core. We evaluate our implementation on real-world and synthetic data, showing that the proposed approach can handle realistic workloads. The results indicate logarithmic memory growth with respect to the event log size and linear growth with the number of provisioning organizations, highlighting scalability properties and opportunities for further optimization.", "AI": {"tldr": "CONFINE\uff1a\u57fa\u4e8e\u53ef\u4fe1\u6267\u884c\u73af\u5883\uff08TEE\uff09\u7684\u4fdd\u5bc6\u6027\u4fdd\u62a4\u8de8\u7ec4\u7ec7\u6d41\u7a0b\u6316\u6398\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u56db\u9636\u6bb5\u534f\u8bae\u5b9e\u73b0\u5b89\u5168\u6570\u636e\u4ea4\u6362\u548c\u5904\u7406\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u8de8\u7ec4\u7ec7\u6d41\u7a0b\u6316\u6398\u4e2d\u7684\u6570\u636e\u4fdd\u5bc6\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e1a\u52a1\u6d41\u7a0b\u5e38\u6d89\u53ca\u591a\u4e2a\u72ec\u7acb\u7ec4\u7ec7\uff0c\u4f46\u8de8\u7ec4\u7ec7\u6d41\u7a0b\u6316\u6398\u9762\u4e34\u4e25\u91cd\u7684\u6570\u636e\u4fdd\u5bc6\u6311\u6218\uff1a\u6570\u636e\u5206\u6790\u53ef\u80fd\u6cc4\u9732\u53c2\u4e0e\u7ec4\u7ec7\u4e0d\u613f\u5411\u5f7c\u6b64\u6216\u7b2c\u4e09\u65b9\u62ab\u9732\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u8fd9\u963b\u788d\u4e86\u8de8\u7ec4\u7ec7\u6d41\u7a0b\u6316\u6398\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faCONFINE\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u53ef\u4fe1\u6267\u884c\u73af\u5883\uff08TEE\uff09\u90e8\u7f72\u53ef\u4fe1\u5e94\u7528\u7a0b\u5e8f\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u56db\u9636\u6bb5\u534f\u8bae\u4fdd\u62a4\u6570\u636e\u4ea4\u6362\u548c\u5904\u7406\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u5206\u6bb5\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u5c06\u4e8b\u4ef6\u65e5\u5fd7\u5206\u6279\u4f20\u8f93\u5230TEE\u4ee5\u907f\u514d\u5185\u5b58\u9650\u5236\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "result": "\u5bf9\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u548c\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u5904\u7406\u5b9e\u9645\u5de5\u4f5c\u8d1f\u8f7d\uff0c\u5185\u5b58\u4f7f\u7528\u968f\u4e8b\u4ef6\u65e5\u5fd7\u5927\u5c0f\u5448\u5bf9\u6570\u589e\u957f\uff0c\u968f\u4f9b\u5e94\u7ec4\u7ec7\u6570\u91cf\u5448\u7ebf\u6027\u589e\u957f\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u826f\u597d\u7684\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "CONFINE\u901a\u8fc7TEE\u6280\u672f\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u8de8\u7ec4\u7ec7\u6d41\u7a0b\u6316\u6398\u4e2d\u7684\u6570\u636e\u4fdd\u5bc6\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5e76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

Most current methods are \"coupled\" in such a way that they generate explanations simultaneously with model inferences. As a result, these approaches incur redundant computation, high latency and poor scalability when deployed across heterogeneous sets of edge devices. In this work we propose Explainability-as-a-Service (XaaS), a distributed architecture for treating explainability as a first-class system service (as opposed to a model-specific feature). The key innovation in our proposed XaaS architecture is that it decouples inference from explanation generation allowing edge devices to request, cache and verify explanations subject to resource and latency constraints. To achieve this, we introduce three main innovations: (1) A distributed explanation cache with a semantic similarity based explanation retrieval method which significantly reduces redundant computation; (2) A lightweight verification protocol that ensures the fidelity of both cached and newly generated explanations; and (3) An adaptive explanation engine that chooses explanation methods based upon device capability and user requirement. We evaluated the performance of XaaS on three real-world edge-AI use cases: (i) manufacturing quality control; (ii) autonomous vehicle perception; and (iii) healthcare diagnostics. Experimental results show that XaaS reduces latency by 38\\% while maintaining high explanation quality across three real-world deployments. Overall, this work enables the deployment of transparent and accountable AI across large scale, heterogeneous IoT systems, and bridges the gap between XAI research and edge-practicality.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faXaaS\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u5c06\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u4f5c\u4e3a\u72ec\u7acb\u670d\u52a1\uff0c\u89e3\u8026\u63a8\u7406\u4e0e\u89e3\u91ca\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u964d\u4f4e\u8fb9\u7f18AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u5ef6\u8fdf38%", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524dXAI\u5728\u8fb9\u7f18\u548cIoT\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u96c6\u6210\u901a\u5e38\u662f\u4e34\u65f6\u4e14\u4f4e\u6548\u7684\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c06\u89e3\u91ca\u751f\u6210\u4e0e\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u8026\u5408\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5197\u4f59\u8ba1\u7b97\u3001\u9ad8\u5ef6\u8fdf\u548c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u5dee", "method": "\u63d0\u51faExplainability-as-a-Service (XaaS)\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u4e09\u4e2a\u521b\u65b0\uff1a1) \u57fa\u4e8e\u8bed\u4e49\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u89e3\u91ca\u7f13\u5b58\uff1b2) \u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u9a8c\u8bc1\u534f\u8bae\u786e\u4fdd\u89e3\u91ca\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\uff1b3) \u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u89e3\u91ca\u5f15\u64ce\u6839\u636e\u8bbe\u5907\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u7528\u6237\u9700\u6c42\u9009\u62e9\u89e3\u91ca\u65b9\u6cd5", "result": "\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u771f\u5b9e\u8fb9\u7f18AI\u7528\u4f8b\uff08\u5236\u9020\u8d28\u91cf\u63a7\u5236\u3001\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u611f\u77e5\u3001\u533b\u7597\u8bca\u65ad\uff09\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0cXaaS\u5c06\u5ef6\u8fdf\u964d\u4f4e38%\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u89e3\u91ca", "conclusion": "XaaS\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u900f\u660e\u548c\u53ef\u95ee\u8d23AI\u5728\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5f02\u6784IoT\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u90e8\u7f72\uff0c\u5f25\u5408\u4e86XAI\u7814\u7a76\u4e0e\u8fb9\u7f18\u5b9e\u8df5\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5dee\u8ddd"}}

This paper addresses the latency-resilient Layer 3 routing optimization problem in telecommunications networks with predefined Layer 1 optical links. We formulate this problem as a graph-based optimization problem with the objective of minimizing latency, creating vertex-disjoint paths from each site to the internet backbone, and maximizing overall resiliency by limiting the impact of dual-link failures. By framing the problem as finding two disjoint shortest paths, coupled together with a resiliency component to the objective function, we establish a single formulation to produce optimal path design. The mathematical formulation was adapted to solve the problem using quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) executed over both quantum simulator and quantum hardware. QAOA was tested on a toy graph topology with 5 vertices and 7 edges and considering two limiting scenarios respectively representing independent (uncorrelated) link failures and highly correlated failure for one pair of edges. Both explored scenarios produced the optimal network design-corresponding to the valid solution with highest frequency of occurrence and minimum energy state, hence, validating the proposed formulation for optimizing Layer 3 routing on quantum systems of the future.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u5c06\u7535\u4fe1\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u7684\u5ef6\u8fdf\u5f39\u6027Layer 3\u8def\u7531\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u56fe\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u91cf\u5b50\u8fd1\u4f3c\u4f18\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5\uff08QAOA\uff09\u5728\u91cf\u5b50\u6a21\u62df\u5668\u548c\u786c\u4ef6\u4e0a\u6c42\u89e3\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u8be5\u516c\u5f0f\u57285\u8282\u70b97\u8fb9\u6d4b\u8bd5\u62d3\u6251\u4e0a\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u7535\u4fe1\u7f51\u7edc\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u5177\u6709\u6307\u6570\u7ea7\u589e\u957f\u7684\u7ec4\u5408\u641c\u7d22\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u9ad8\u3002\u9700\u8981\u89e3\u51b3\u5177\u6709\u9884\u5b9a\u4e49Layer 1\u5149\u94fe\u8def\u7684Layer 3\u8def\u7531\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u76ee\u6807\u662f\uff1a\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u5ef6\u8fdf\u3001\u521b\u5efa\u4ece\u6bcf\u4e2a\u7ad9\u70b9\u5230\u4e92\u8054\u7f51\u9aa8\u5e72\u7f51\u7684\u9876\u70b9\u4e0d\u76f8\u4ea4\u8def\u5f84\u3001\u901a\u8fc7\u9650\u5236\u53cc\u94fe\u8def\u6545\u969c\u5f71\u54cd\u6765\u6700\u5927\u5316\u6574\u4f53\u5f39\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u95ee\u9898\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u56fe\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u76ee\u6807\u51fd\u6570\u5305\u542b\u5ef6\u8fdf\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u548c\u5f39\u6027\u6700\u5927\u5316\u3002\u5177\u4f53\u5316\u4e3a\u5bfb\u627e\u4e24\u6761\u4e0d\u76f8\u4ea4\u7684\u6700\u77ed\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u76ee\u6807\u51fd\u6570\u4e2d\u52a0\u5165\u5f39\u6027\u7ec4\u4ef6\u3002\u5c06\u8be5\u6570\u5b66\u516c\u5f0f\u9002\u914d\u4e3a\u91cf\u5b50\u8fd1\u4f3c\u4f18\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5\uff08QAOA\uff09\uff0c\u5728\u91cf\u5b50\u6a21\u62df\u5668\u548c\u91cf\u5b50\u786c\u4ef6\u4e0a\u6267\u884c\u3002\u5728\u5305\u542b5\u4e2a\u9876\u70b9\u548c7\u6761\u8fb9\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u62d3\u6251\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u8003\u8651\u4e24\u79cd\u6781\u9650\u573a\u666f\uff1a\u72ec\u7acb\u94fe\u8def\u6545\u969c\u548c\u9ad8\u5ea6\u76f8\u5173\u6545\u969c\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u63a2\u7d22\u7684\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u90fd\u4ea7\u751f\u4e86\u6700\u4f18\u7f51\u7edc\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u5bf9\u5e94\u51fa\u73b0\u9891\u7387\u6700\u9ad8\u7684\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u548c\u6700\u5c0f\u80fd\u91cf\u72b6\u6001\u3002\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u516c\u5f0f\u5728\u91cf\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e0a\u4f18\u5316Layer 3\u8def\u7531\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6210\u529f\u5c06\u5ef6\u8fdf\u5f39\u6027Layer 3\u8def\u7531\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u9002\u914d\u4e3a\u91cf\u5b50\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7QAOA\u5728\u6d4b\u8bd5\u62d3\u6251\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u91cf\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e0a\u7684\u7f51\u7edc\u4f18\u5316\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u8def\u5f84\u3002"}}

The looseness and estimator-dependent bias can make IB \"compression\" only indirectly controlled and optimization fragile.\n  We revisit the IB problem through the lens of information geometry and propose a \\textbf{Geo}metric \\textbf{I}nformation \\textbf{B}ottleneck (\\textbf{GeoIB}) that dispenses with mutual information (MI) estimation. We show that I(X;Z) and I(Z;Y) admit exact projection forms as minimal Kullback-Leibler (KL) distances from the joint distributions to their respective independence manifolds. Guided by this view, GeoIB controls information compression with two complementary terms: (i) a distribution-level Fisher-Rao (FR) discrepancy, which matches KL to second order and is reparameterization-invariant; and (ii) a geometry-level Jacobian-Frobenius (JF) term that provides a local capacity-type upper bound on I(Z;X) by penalizing pullback volume expansion of the encoder. We further derive a natural-gradient optimizer consistent with the FR metric and prove that the standard additive natural-gradient step is first-order equivalent to the geodesic update. We conducted extensive experiments and observed that the GeoIB achieves a better trade-off between prediction accuracy and compression ratio in the information plane than the mainstream IB baselines on popular datasets. GeoIB improves invariance and optimization stability by unifying distributional and geometric regularization under a single bottleneck multiplier.

However, their selection remains poorly understood and is often treated merely as another tunable hyperparameter rather than as a principled design decision. This work provides a theoretical analysis of target fixing in tabular Q-learning through the lens of approximate dynamic programming. We formulate periodic target updates as a nested optimization scheme in which each outer iteration applies an inexact Bellman optimality operator, approximated by a generic inner loop optimizer. Rigorous theory yields a finite-time convergence analysis for the asynchronous sampling setting, specializing to stochastic gradient descent in the inner loop. Our results deliver an explicit characterization of the bias-variance trade-off induced by the target update period, showing how to optimally set this critical hyperparameter. We prove that constant target update schedules are suboptimal, incurring a logarithmic overhead in sample complexity that is entirely avoidable with adaptive schedules. Our analysis shows that the optimal target update frequency increases geometrically over the course of the learning process.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u4ece\u8fd1\u4f3c\u52a8\u6001\u89c4\u5212\u89d2\u5ea6\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u4e86Q\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u76ee\u6807\u7f51\u7edc\u66f4\u65b0\u9891\u7387\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u6052\u5b9a\u66f4\u65b0\u9891\u7387\u662f\u6b21\u4f18\u7684\uff0c\u800c\u51e0\u4f55\u589e\u957f\u7684\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u8c03\u5ea6\u80fd\u907f\u514d\u5bf9\u6570\u7ea7\u6837\u672c\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u5f00\u9500\u3002", "motivation": "\u76ee\u6807\u7f51\u7edc\u66f4\u65b0\u9891\u7387\u662f\u6df1\u5ea6Q\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u6838\u5fc3\u7a33\u5b9a\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u4f46\u5f53\u524d\u5bf9\u5176\u9009\u62e9\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7406\u8bba\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u901a\u5e38\u4ec5\u4f5c\u4e3a\u53ef\u8c03\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u800c\u975e\u539f\u5219\u6027\u8bbe\u8ba1\u51b3\u7b56\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u63d0\u4f9b\u76ee\u6807\u7f51\u7edc\u56fa\u5b9a\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u9610\u660e\u5176\u5185\u5728\u673a\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u5468\u671f\u6027\u76ee\u6807\u66f4\u65b0\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u5d4c\u5957\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6848\uff1a\u5916\u5c42\u8fed\u4ee3\u5e94\u7528\u4e0d\u7cbe\u786e\u7684Bellman\u6700\u4f18\u7b97\u5b50\uff0c\u5185\u5c42\u5faa\u73af\u7528\u901a\u7528\u4f18\u5316\u5668\u8fd1\u4f3c\u3002\u5728\u5f02\u6b65\u91c7\u6837\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u8fdb\u884c\u6709\u9650\u65f6\u95f4\u6536\u655b\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u4ee5\u5185\u5c42\u4f7f\u7528\u968f\u673a\u68af\u5ea6\u4e0b\u964d\u4e3a\u4f8b\u3002", "result": "\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u660e\u786e\u523b\u753b\u4e86\u76ee\u6807\u66f4\u65b0\u5468\u671f\u5f15\u8d77\u7684\u504f\u5dee-\u65b9\u5dee\u6743\u8861\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5982\u4f55\u6700\u4f18\u8bbe\u7f6e\u8fd9\u4e00\u5173\u952e\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u3002\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u6052\u5b9a\u76ee\u6807\u66f4\u65b0\u8c03\u5ea6\u662f\u6b21\u4f18\u7684\uff0c\u4f1a\u4ea7\u751f\u53ef\u907f\u514d\u7684\u5bf9\u6570\u7ea7\u6837\u672c\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u5f00\u9500\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6700\u4f18\u76ee\u6807\u66f4\u65b0\u9891\u7387\u5e94\u5728\u5b66\u4e60\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u51e0\u4f55\u589e\u957f\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u4fdd\u6301\u6052\u5b9a\u3002\u8fd9\u4e3aQ\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u76ee\u6807\u7f51\u7edc\u66f4\u65b0\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u6307\u5bfc\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u8c03\u5ea6\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6837\u672c\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}

Focusing on monthly and quarterly time series with at most 20 years of historical data, we evaluate whether a fully automatic, purely feedback-driven ESN can serve as a competitive alternative to widely used statistical forecasting methods. The study adopts a rigorous two-stage evaluation approach: a Parameter dataset is used to conduct an extensive hyperparameter sweep covering leakage rate, spectral radius, reservoir size, and information criteria for regularization, resulting in over four million ESN model fits; a disjoint Forecast dataset is then used for out-of-sample accuracy assessment. Forecast accuracy is measured using MASE and sMAPE and benchmarked against simple benchmarks like drift and seasonal naive and statistical models like ARIMA, ETS, and TBATS. The hyperparameter analysis reveals consistent and interpretable patterns, with monthly series favoring moderately persistent reservoirs and quarterly series favoring more contractive dynamics. Across both frequencies, high leakage rates are preferred, while optimal spectral radii and reservoir sizes vary with temporal resolution. In the out-of-sample evaluation, the ESN performs on par with ARIMA and TBATS for monthly data and achieves the lowest mean MASE for quarterly data, while requiring lower computational cost than the more complex statistical models. Overall, the results demonstrate that ESNs offer a compelling balance between predictive accuracy, robustness, and computational efficiency, positioning them as a practical option for automated time series forecasting.", "AI": {"tldr": "ESN\u5728M4\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8fd9\u79cd\u7eaf\u53cd\u9988\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u7f51\u7edc\u5728\u6708\u5ea6\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u4e0eARIMA/TBATS\u76f8\u5f53\uff0c\u5728\u5b63\u5ea6\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\uff0c\u4e14\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u66f4\u4f4e\uff0c\u4e3a\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u9884\u6d4b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u9009\u62e9\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u8bc4\u4f30\u5b8c\u5168\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u7684\u7eaf\u53cd\u9988\u9a71\u52a8\u56de\u58f0\u72b6\u6001\u7f51\u7edc(ESN)\u662f\u5426\u80fd\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5e7f\u6cdb\u4f7f\u7528\u7684\u7edf\u8ba1\u9884\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u7ade\u4e89\u6027\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u6708\u5ea6/\u5b63\u5ea6\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u9884\u6d4b\u4e2d\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u4e25\u683c\u7684\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u8bc4\u4f30\uff1a\u4f7f\u7528\u53c2\u6570\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8fdb\u884c\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u626b\u63cf\uff08\u6cc4\u6f0f\u7387\u3001\u8c31\u534a\u5f84\u3001\u50a8\u5907\u6c60\u5927\u5c0f\u3001\u6b63\u5219\u5316\uff09\uff0c\u8d85\u8fc7400\u4e07\u6b21ESN\u62df\u5408\uff1b\u7136\u540e\u4f7f\u7528\u4e0d\u76f8\u4ea4\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8fdb\u884c\u6837\u672c\u5916\u7cbe\u5ea6\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u4ee5MASE\u548csMAPE\u4e3a\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u4e0e\u6f02\u79fb\u3001\u5b63\u8282\u6027\u6734\u7d20\u3001ARIMA\u3001ETS\u3001TBATS\u7b49\u57fa\u51c6\u5bf9\u6bd4\u3002", "result": "\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u5206\u6790\u663e\u793a\u4e00\u81f4\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6a21\u5f0f\uff1a\u6708\u5ea6\u5e8f\u5217\u504f\u597d\u4e2d\u7b49\u6301\u7eed\u6027\u50a8\u5907\u6c60\uff0c\u5b63\u5ea6\u5e8f\u5217\u504f\u597d\u6536\u7f29\u6027\u52a8\u6001\uff1b\u9ad8\u6cc4\u6f0f\u7387\u666e\u904d\u4f18\u9009\u3002\u6837\u672c\u5916\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\uff0cESN\u5728\u6708\u5ea6\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u4e0eARIMA/TBATS\u76f8\u5f53\uff0c\u5728\u5b63\u5ea6\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u83b7\u5f97\u6700\u4f4e\u5e73\u5747MASE\uff0c\u4e14\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u4f4e\u4e8e\u590d\u6742\u7edf\u8ba1\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "conclusion": "ESN\u5728\u9884\u6d4b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3001\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u4e4b\u95f4\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5f15\u4eba\u6ce8\u76ee\u7684\u5e73\u8861\uff0c\u4f7f\u5176\u6210\u4e3a\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u9009\u62e9\u3002"}}

We propose a novel, lightweight framework that relaxes the strict requirements on Super-Structure construction while preserving the algorithmic benefits of divide-and-conquer. By integrating weakly constrained Super-Structures with efficient graph partitioning and merging strategies, our approach substantially lowers CI test overhead without sacrificing accuracy. We instantiate the framework in a concrete causal discovery algorithm and rigorously evaluate its components on synthetic data. Comprehensive experiments on Gaussian Bayesian networks, including magic-NIAB, ECOLI70, and magic-IRRI, demonstrate that our method matches or closely approximates the structural accuracy of PC and FCI while drastically reducing the number of CI tests. Further validation on the real-world China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study (CHARLS) dataset confirms its practical applicability. Our results establish that accurate, scalable causal discovery is achievable even under minimal assumptions about the initial Super-Structure, opening new avenues for applying divide-and-conquer methods to large-scale, knowledge-scarce domains such as biomedical and social science research.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u653e\u5bbd\u5bf9\u8d85\u7ea7\u7ed3\u6784\u6784\u5efa\u7684\u4e25\u683c\u8981\u6c42\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u5206\u6cbb\u7b97\u6cd5\u4f18\u52bf\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u5927\u5e45\u964d\u4f4e\u6761\u4ef6\u72ec\u7acb\u6027\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u57fa\u4e8e\u8d85\u7ea7\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u5206\u6cbb\u56e0\u679c\u53d1\u73b0\u4e2d\u7684\u5173\u952e\u74f6\u9888\uff1a\u5f53\u6761\u4ef6\u72ec\u7acb\u6027\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u6602\u4e14\u9886\u57df\u77e5\u8bc6\u4e0d\u53ef\u7528\u65f6\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u51c6\u786e\u8d85\u7ea7\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u9ad8\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u5f31\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u8d85\u7ea7\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0e\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u56fe\u5212\u5206\u548c\u5408\u5e76\u7b56\u7565\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u5b9e\u4f8b\u5316\u4e3a\u5177\u4f53\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u53d1\u73b0\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\uff08\u9ad8\u65af\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u7f51\u7edc\uff09\u4e0a\uff0c\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u7ed3\u6784\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e0a\u5339\u914d\u6216\u63a5\u8fd1PC\u548cFCI\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5927\u5e45\u51cf\u5c11CI\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6570\u91cf\uff1b\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754cCHARLS\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5b9e\u9645\u9002\u7528\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5373\u4f7f\u5728\u521d\u59cb\u8d85\u7ea7\u7ed3\u6784\u5047\u8bbe\u6700\u5c0f\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u4e5f\u80fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u51c6\u786e\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u4e3a\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u3001\u77e5\u8bc6\u7a00\u7f3a\u9886\u57df\uff08\u5982\u751f\u7269\u533b\u5b66\u548c\u793e\u4f1a\u79d1\u5b66\u7814\u7a76\uff09\u5e94\u7528\u5206\u6cbb\u65b9\u6cd5\u5f00\u8f9f\u4e86\u65b0\u9014\u5f84\u3002"}}

To address this gap, we develop \\textbf{SpecMD}, a standardized framework for benchmarking ad-hoc cache policies on various hardware configurations. Using SpecMD, we perform an exhaustive benchmarking of several MoE caching strategies, reproducing and extending prior approaches in controlled settings with realistic constraints. Our experiments reveal that MoE expert access is not consistent with temporal locality assumptions (e.g LRU, LFU). Motivated by this observation, we propose \\textbf{Least-Stale}, a novel eviction policy that exploits MoE's predictable expert access patterns to reduce collision misses by up to $85\\times$ over LRU.

We develop a theoretical basis for OVQ-attention based on Gaussian mixture regression, and we test it on a variety of synthetic long context tasks and on long context language modeling. OVQ-attention shows significant improvements over linear attention baselines and the original VQ-attention, on which OVQ-attention was inspired.

To unify this landscape, we introduce WIND, a single pre-trained foundation model capable of replacing specialized baselines across a vast array of tasks. Crucially, in contrast to previous atmospheric foundation models, we achieve this without any task-specific fine-tuning. To learn a robust, task-agnostic prior of the atmosphere, we pre-train WIND with a self-supervised video reconstruction objective, utilizing an unconditional video diffusion model to iteratively reconstruct atmospheric dynamics from a noisy state. At inference, we frame diverse domain-specific problems strictly as inverse problems and solve them via posterior sampling. This unified approach allows us to tackle highly relevant weather and climate problems, including probabilistic forecasting, spatial and temporal downscaling, sparse reconstruction and enforcing conservation laws purely with our pre-trained model. We further demonstrate the model's capacity to generate physically consistent counterfactual storylines of extreme weather events under global warming scenarios.

AURA uses a regulatory-aware state encoding 127 federal and local constraints, Pareto-constrained policy gradients with feasibility guarantees, and reward decomposition separating immediate costs from long-term social outcomes. On datasets from 8 U.S. metros (47,392 candidate parcels), AURA attains 94.3% regulatory compliance and improves Pareto hypervolume by 37.2% over strong baselines.

While prior work has focused on training-time regularization and low-order representation statistics, little is known about whether the geometric structure of learned embeddings provides reliable post-hoc signals of robustness. We propose a geometry-based diagnostic framework that constructs class-conditional mutual k-nearest-neighbor graphs from in-distribution embeddings and extracts two complementary invariants: a global spectral complexity proxy based on the reduced log-determinant of the normalized Laplacian, and a local smoothness measure based on Ollivier--Ricci curvature. Across multiple architectures, training regimes, and corruption benchmarks, we find that lower spectral complexity and higher mean curvature consistently predict stronger OOD accuracy across checkpoints. Controlled perturbations and topological analyses further show that these signals reflect meaningful representation structure rather than superficial embedding statistics. Our results demonstrate that representation geometry enables interpretable, label-free robustness diagnosis and supports reliable unsupervised checkpoint selection under distribution shift.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u51e0\u4f55\u7684\u8bca\u65ad\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6784\u5efa\u7c7b\u522b\u6761\u4ef6\u4e92k\u8fd1\u90bb\u56fe\uff0c\u63d0\u53d6\u5168\u5c40\u8c31\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u548c\u5c40\u90e8\u5e73\u6ed1\u5ea6\u4e24\u4e2a\u51e0\u4f55\u4e0d\u53d8\u91cf\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u65e0\u6807\u7b7e\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u79fb\u4e0b\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u7f3a\u4e4f\u76ee\u6807\u57df\u6807\u7b7e\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u76d1\u63a7\u548c\u4f18\u5316\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u79fb\u4e0b\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6cdb\u5316\u4ecd\u7136\u56f0\u96be\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u548c\u4f4e\u9636\u8868\u793a\u7edf\u8ba1\u91cf\uff0c\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u5b66\u4e60\u5d4c\u5165\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\u662f\u5426\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u9760\u540e\u9a8c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4fe1\u53f7\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u51e0\u4f55\u8bca\u65ad\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1\uff09\u4ece\u5206\u5e03\u5185\u5d4c\u5165\u6784\u5efa\u7c7b\u522b\u6761\u4ef6\u4e92k\u8fd1\u90bb\u56fe\uff1b2\uff09\u63d0\u53d6\u4e24\u4e2a\u4e92\u8865\u4e0d\u53d8\u91cf\uff1a\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u62c9\u666e\u62c9\u65af\u77e9\u9635\u7ea6\u5316\u5bf9\u6570\u884c\u5217\u5f0f\u7684\u5168\u5c40\u8c31\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u4ee3\u7406\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u57fa\u4e8eOllivier-Ricci\u66f2\u7387\u7684\u5c40\u90e8\u5e73\u6ed1\u5ea6\u5ea6\u91cf\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u67b6\u6784\u3001\u8bad\u7ec3\u673a\u5236\u548c\u8150\u8d25\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u8f83\u4f4e\u7684\u8c31\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u548c\u8f83\u9ad8\u7684\u5e73\u5747\u66f2\u7387\u4e00\u81f4\u9884\u6d4b\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u5916\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3002\u53d7\u63a7\u6270\u52a8\u548c\u62d3\u6251\u5206\u6790\u8868\u660e\u8fd9\u4e9b\u4fe1\u53f7\u53cd\u6620\u4e86\u6709\u610f\u4e49\u7684\u8868\u793a\u7ed3\u6784\u800c\u975e\u8868\u9762\u5d4c\u5165\u7edf\u8ba1\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8868\u793a\u51e0\u4f55\u80fd\u591f\u5b9e\u73b0\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u3001\u65e0\u6807\u7b7e\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u8bca\u65ad\uff0c\u5e76\u652f\u6301\u5728\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u79fb\u4e0b\u8fdb\u884c\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u65e0\u4eba\u76d1\u7763\u68c0\u67e5\u70b9\u9009\u62e9\u3002"}}

The Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) data from Bangladesh for 2011-2022, with n = 33,962, are used in this paper. We trained the model on (2011-2014) data, validated it on 2017 data, and tested it on 2022 data. Eight years after the initial test of the model, a genetic algorithm-based Neural Architecture Search found a single-layer neural architecture (with 64 units) to be superior to XGBoost (AUROC = 0.76 vs. 0.73; p < 0.01). Additionally, through a detailed fairness audit, we identified an overall \"Socioeconomic Predictive Gradient,\" with a positive correlation between regional poverty level (r = -0.62) and the algorithm's AUC. In addition, we found that the model performed at its highest levels in the least affluent divisions (AUC 0.74) and decreased dramatically in the wealthiest divisions (AUC 0.66). These findings suggest that the model is identifying areas with the greatest need for intervention. Our model would identify approximately 1300 additional at-risk children annually than a Gradient Boosting model when screened at the 10% level and validated using SHAP values and Platt Calibration, and therefore provide a robust, production-ready computational phenotype for targeted maternal and child health interventions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4f7f\u7528\u9057\u4f20\u7b97\u6cd5\u795e\u7ecf\u67b6\u6784\u641c\u7d22\u5f00\u53d1\u513f\u7ae5\u6b7b\u4ea1\u7387\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5728\u65f6\u5e8f\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e2d\u4f18\u4e8eXGBoost\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u5ba1\u8ba1\u53d1\u73b0\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8d2b\u56f0\u5730\u533a\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u597d\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u51fa\u66f4\u591a\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u513f\u7ae5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u513f\u7ae5\u6b7b\u4ea1\u7387\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u5b58\u5728\u524d\u77bb\u6027\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u5728\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u672a\u6765\u4eba\u7fa4\u65f6\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u66f4\u7a33\u5065\u7684\u65f6\u5e8f\u9a8c\u8bc1\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u5b5f\u52a0\u62c9\u56fd2011-2022\u5e74DHS\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u65f6\u5e8f\u5212\u5206\u8bad\u7ec3(2011-2014)\u3001\u9a8c\u8bc1(2017)\u3001\u6d4b\u8bd5(2022)\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u9057\u4f20\u7b97\u6cd5\u795e\u7ecf\u67b6\u6784\u641c\u7d22\u627e\u5230\u6700\u4f18\u5355\u5c42\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u7ed3\u6784(64\u4e2a\u5355\u5143)\uff0c\u5e76\u4e0eXGBoost\u6bd4\u8f83\u3002\u4f7f\u7528SHAP\u503c\u548cPlatt\u6821\u51c6\u8fdb\u884c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "result": "\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc(AUROC=0.76)\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8eXGBoost(0.73)\u3002\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u5ba1\u8ba1\u663e\u793a\u533a\u57df\u8d2b\u56f0\u6c34\u5e73\u4e0e\u6a21\u578bAUC\u5448\u8d1f\u76f8\u5173(r=-0.62)\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6700\u8d2b\u56f0\u5730\u533a\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u597d(AUC 0.74)\uff0c\u5728\u6700\u5bcc\u88d5\u5730\u533a\u6700\u5dee(0.66)\u3002\u572810%\u7b5b\u67e5\u9608\u503c\u4e0b\uff0c\u6bcf\u5e74\u53ef\u6bd4\u68af\u5ea6\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u591a\u8bc6\u522b1300\u540d\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u513f\u7ae5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7a33\u5065\u3001\u53ef\u90e8\u7f72\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u8868\u578b\uff0c\u80fd\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u5730\u8bc6\u522b\u9700\u8981\u5e72\u9884\u7684\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u513f\u7ae5\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u6700\u9700\u8981\u5e2e\u52a9\u7684\u8d2b\u56f0\u5730\u533a\uff0c\u4e3a\u9488\u5bf9\u6027\u5987\u5e7c\u5065\u5eb7\u5e72\u9884\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

However, due to its linear nature, it often fails to capture the complex underlying structure of real-world data. While Kernel PCA (kPCA) addresses non-linearity, it sacrifices interpretability and struggles with hyperparameter selection. In this paper, we propose a robust non-linear PCA framework that unifies the interpretability of PCA with the flexibility of neural networks. Our method parametrizes variable transformations via neural networks, optimized using Evolution Strategies (ES) to handle the non-differentiability of eigendecomposition. We introduce a novel, granular objective function that maximizes the individual variance contribution of each variable providing a stronger learning signal than global variance maximization. This approach natively handles categorical and ordinal variables without the dimensional explosion associated with one-hot encoding. We demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms both linear PCA and kPCA in explained variance across synthetic and real-world datasets. At the same time, it preserves PCA's interpretability, enabling visualization and analysis of feature contributions using standard tools such as biplots.

Thus, a shock to one token may result in significant and uncontrolled contagion effects. As the DeFi ecosystem becomes increasingly linked with traditional financial infrastructure through instruments, such as stablecoins, the risk posed by this dynamic demands more powerful quantification tools. We introduce DeXposure-FM, the first time-series, graph foundation model for measuring and forecasting inter-protocol credit exposure on DeFi networks, to the best of our knowledge. Employing a graph-tabular encoder, with pre-trained weight initialization, and multiple task-specific heads, DeXposure-FM is trained on the DeXposure dataset that has 43.7 million data entries, across 4,300+ protocols on 602 blockchains, covering 24,300+ unique tokens. The training is operationalized for credit-exposure forecasting, predicting the joint dynamics of (1) protocol-level flows, and (2) the topology and weights of credit-exposure links. The DeXposure-FM is empirically validated on two machine learning benchmarks; it consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches, including a graph foundation model and temporal graph neural networks. DeXposure-FM further produces financial economics tools that support macroprudential monitoring and scenario-based DeFi stress testing, by enabling protocol-level systemic-importance scores, sector-level spillover and concentration measures via a forecast-then-measure pipeline. Empirical verification fully supports our financial economics tools. The model and code have been publicly available.

Unfortunately, CP uncertainty regions can grow significantly in long horizon missions, rendering the statistical guarantees uninformative. To that end, we propose infusing CP with geometric information via group-averaging of the pretrained predictor to distribute the non-conformity mass across the orbits. Each sample now is treated as a representative of an orbit, thus uncertainty can be mitigated by other samples entangled to it via the orbit inducing elements of the symmetry group. Our approach provably yields contracted non-conformity scores in increasing convex order, implying improved exponential-tail bounds and sharper conformal prediction sets in expectation, especially at high confidence levels.

We attempted to enforce this assumption by penalizing unfaithful reasoning, but found that surface-level compliance does not guarantee causal reliance. Our central finding is negative: even when CoT is verbose, strategic, and flagged by surface-level manipulation detectors, model answers are often causally independent of the CoT content. We present a diagnostic framework for auditing this failure mode: it combines (i) an interpretable behavioral module that scores manipulation-relevant signals in CoT text and (ii) a causal probe that measures CoT-mediated influence (CMI) via hidden-state patching and reports a bypass score ($1-\\mathrm{CMI}$), quantifying the degree to which the answer is produced by a bypass circuit independent of the rationale. In pilot evaluations, audit-aware prompting increases detectable manipulation signals (mean risk-score delta: $+5.10$), yet causal probes reveal task-dependent mediation: many QA items exhibit near-total bypass (CMI $\\approx 0$), while some logic problems show stronger mediation (CMI up to $0.56$).

While recent additive models (like KANs) attempt to address this using splines, they often suffer from computational inefficiency and boundary instability. We propose the Rational-ANOVA Network (RAN), a foundational architecture grounded in functional ANOVA decomposition and Pad\u00e9-style rational approximation. RAN models f(x) as a composition of main effects and sparse pairwise interactions, where each component is parameterized by a stable, learnable rational unit. Crucially, we enforce a strictly positive denominator, which avoids poles and numerical instability while capturing sharp transitions and near-singular behaviors more efficiently than polynomial bases. This ANOVA structure provides an explicit low-order interaction bias for data efficiency and interpretability, while the rational parameterization significantly improves extrapolation. Across controlled function benchmarks and vision classification tasks (e.g., CIFAR-10) under matched parameter and compute budgets, RAN matches or surpasses parameter-matched MLPs and learnable-activation baselines, with better stability and throughput.

The growing variety of such models, trained with different data and architectures, calls for principled methods to identify which types of prompts lead to distinct model behaviors. In this work, we propose PromptSplit, a kernel-based framework for detecting and analyzing prompt-dependent disagreement between generative models. For each compared model pair, PromptSplit constructs a joint prompt--output representation by forming tensor-product embeddings of the prompt and image (or text) features, and then computes the corresponding kernel covariance matrix. We utilize the eigenspace of the weighted difference between these matrices to identify the main directions of behavioral difference across prompts. To ensure scalability, we employ a random-projection approximation that reduces computational complexity to $O(nr^2 + r^3)$ for projection dimension $r$. We further provide a theoretical analysis showing that this approximation yields an eigenstructure estimate whose expected deviation from the full-dimensional result is bounded by $O(1/r^2)$. Experiments across text-to-image, text-to-text, and image-captioning settings demonstrate that PromptSplit accurately detects ground-truth behavioral differences and isolates the prompts responsible, offering an interpretable tool for detecting where generative models disagree.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faPromptSplit\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6838\u65b9\u6cd5\u68c0\u6d4b\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u95f4\u7684\u63d0\u793a\u4f9d\u8d56\u5206\u6b67\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u5bfc\u81f4\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u578b\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u63d0\u793a\u7c7b\u578b\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u63d0\u793a\u5f15\u5bfc\u751f\u6210AI\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u89c6\u89c9\u548c\u8bed\u8a00\u9886\u57df\u7684\u5feb\u901f\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u548c\u67b6\u6784\u4e0a\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\u5bfc\u81f4\u5bf9\u76f8\u540c\u63d0\u793a\u4ea7\u751f\u4e0d\u540c\u54cd\u5e94\u3002\u9700\u8981\u7cfb\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u8bc6\u522b\u54ea\u4e9b\u63d0\u793a\u7c7b\u578b\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u6a21\u578b\u884c\u4e3a\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faPromptSplit\u6846\u67b6\uff1a\u4e3a\u6bcf\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u6784\u5efa\u63d0\u793a-\u8f93\u51fa\u7684\u5f20\u91cf\u79ef\u5d4c\u5165\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6838\u534f\u65b9\u5dee\u77e9\u9635\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u52a0\u6743\u5dee\u77e9\u9635\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u7a7a\u95f4\u8bc6\u522b\u884c\u4e3a\u5dee\u5f02\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u65b9\u5411\u3002\u91c7\u7528\u968f\u673a\u6295\u5f71\u8fd1\u4f3c\u964d\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u81f3O(nr\u00b2 + r\u00b3)\u3002", "result": "\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u663e\u793a\u968f\u673a\u6295\u5f71\u8fd1\u4f3c\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u7ed3\u6784\u4f30\u8ba1\u4e0e\u5168\u7ef4\u7ed3\u679c\u7684\u671f\u671b\u504f\u5dee\u6709\u754c\u4e3aO(1/r\u00b2)\u3002\u5728\u6587\u751f\u56fe\u3001\u6587\u751f\u6587\u548c\u56fe\u50cf\u63cf\u8ff0\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cPromptSplit\u80fd\u51c6\u786e\u68c0\u6d4b\u771f\u5b9e\u884c\u4e3a\u5dee\u5f02\u5e76\u5b9a\u4f4d\u76f8\u5173\u63d0\u793a\u3002", "conclusion": "PromptSplit\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u68c0\u6d4b\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u54ea\u4e9b\u63d0\u793a\u4e0a\u5b58\u5728\u5206\u6b67\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u7406\u89e3\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u5dee\u5f02\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002"}}

Constraints from inference latency in scalable serving and fine-tuning cost in edge or rapid-deployment settings make the choice of which layers to fine-tune unavoidable. Yet current practice typically applies PEFT uniformly across all layers, with limited understanding or leverage of layer selection. This paper develops a unified projected residual view of PEFT on top of a frozen base model. Under a local quadratic approximation, layerwise adaptation is governed by three quantities: (i) the projected residual norm (resnorm), which measures how much correctable bias a layer can capture; (ii) the activation energy, which determines feature conditioning; and (iii) layer coupling, which quantifies how strongly residuals interact across layers. We show that, for squared loss and linear adapters, the resnorm equals a normalized gradient norm, activation energy controls ill-conditioning and noise amplification, and weak coupling yields approximately additive layerwise contributions. Building on these insights, we introduce the Layer Card, a reusable diagnostic that summarizes residual signal strength, compute cost, and performance for each layer of a given model. With an identical model and LoRA configuration, Layer Card-guided placement refines the choice of adapted layers to flexibly prioritize different objectives, such as maximizing performance or reducing fine-tuning cost. Moreover, on Qwen3-8B, we show that selectively adapting a subset of layers can achieve performance close to full-layer LoRA while substantially reducing fine-tuning cost and the number of adapter-augmented layers during inference, offering a more cost-performance-aware alternative to full-layer insertion.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86Layer Card\u8bca\u65ad\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u6307\u5bfc\u53c2\u6570\u9ad8\u6548\u5fae\u8c03\uff08PEFT\uff09\u4e2d\u7684\u5c42\u9009\u62e9\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u6b8b\u5dee\u8303\u6570\u3001\u6fc0\u6d3b\u80fd\u91cf\u548c\u5c42\u8026\u5408\u7b49\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u6210\u672c\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u5e73\u8861\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u89c4\u6a21\u589e\u957f\uff0c\u5168\u53c2\u6570\u5fae\u8c03\u6210\u672c\u8fc7\u9ad8\uff0c\u53c2\u6570\u9ad8\u6548\u5fae\u8c03\u6210\u4e3a\u4e3b\u6d41\u3002\u7136\u800c\u5f53\u524dPEFT\u901a\u5e38\u5747\u5300\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u6240\u6709\u5c42\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u5c42\u9009\u62e9\u7684\u6df1\u5165\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u6709\u6548\u5229\u7528\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u5ef6\u8fdf\u3001\u5fae\u8c03\u6210\u672c\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u4e4b\u95f4\u53d6\u5f97\u6700\u4f73\u5e73\u8861\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u6295\u5f71\u6b8b\u5dee\u89c6\u89d2\u5206\u6790PEFT\uff0c\u5728\u5c40\u90e8\u4e8c\u6b21\u8fd1\u4f3c\u4e0b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e09\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u91cf\u5206\u6790\u5c42\u9002\u5e94\uff1a\u6295\u5f71\u6b8b\u5dee\u8303\u6570\uff08\u8861\u91cf\u53ef\u7ea0\u6b63\u504f\u5dee\uff09\u3001\u6fc0\u6d3b\u80fd\u91cf\uff08\u51b3\u5b9a\u7279\u5f81\u6761\u4ef6\uff09\u3001\u5c42\u8026\u5408\uff08\u91cf\u5316\u5c42\u95f4\u6b8b\u5dee\u4ea4\u4e92\uff09\u3002\u57fa\u4e8e\u6b64\u5f00\u53d1Layer Card\u8bca\u65ad\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u603b\u7ed3\u6bcf\u5c42\u7684\u6b8b\u5dee\u4fe1\u53f7\u5f3a\u5ea6\u3001\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "result": "\u5728Qwen3-8B\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\uff0cLayer Card\u6307\u5bfc\u7684\u5c42\u9009\u62e9\u7b56\u7565\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u63a5\u8fd1\u5168\u5c42LoRA\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u5fae\u8c03\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u9002\u914d\u5668\u589e\u5f3a\u7684\u5c42\u6570\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u5177\u6210\u672c\u6548\u76ca\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "conclusion": "Layer Card\u4e3aPEFT\u5c42\u9009\u62e9\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7cfb\u7edf\u5316\u7684\u8bca\u65ad\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4f7f\u7814\u7a76\u4eba\u5458\u80fd\u591f\u6839\u636e\u6027\u80fd\u3001\u6210\u672c\u7b49\u4e0d\u540c\u76ee\u6807\u7075\u6d3b\u4f18\u5316\u5c42\u9002\u5e94\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u4e3a\u53c2\u6570\u9ad8\u6548\u5fae\u8c03\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u667a\u80fd\u3001\u66f4\u7ecf\u6d4e\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

Our primary contribution is GroupCLIP, a novel group-level contrastive loss that bridges the gap between CLIP for paired cross-modal data and SupCon for uni-modal supervised contrastive learning, addressing a fundamental gap in contrastive learning for weakly-paired settings. We integrate GroupCLIP with an on-the-fly backtranslating autoencoder framework to encourage cross-modally entangled representations while maintaining group-level coherence within a shared latent space. Critically, we introduce a comprehensive combinatorial evaluation framework that systematically assesses representation learners across multiple optimal transport aligners, addressing key limitations in existing evaluation strategies. This framework includes novel simulations that systematically vary shared versus modality-specific perturbation effects enabling principled assessment of method robustness. Our combinatorial benchmarking reveals that there is not yet an aligner that uniformly dominates across settings or modality pairs. Across simulations and two real single-cell genetic perturbation datasets, GROOVE performs on par with or outperforms existing approaches for downstream cross-modal matching and imputation tasks. Our ablation studies demonstrate that GroupCLIP is the key component driving performance gains.

By modeling directories as topics and users as agents within a multi-level interaction graph, we simulate access evolution using influence-weighted opinion dynamics. Logical dependencies between users are encoded in dynamic matrices Ci, and directory similarity is captured via a shared influence matrix W. Malicious behavior is injected as cross-component logical perturbations that violate structural norms of strongly connected components(SCCs). We apply theoretical guarantees from opinion dynamics literature to determine topic convergence and detect anomaly via scaled opinion variance. To quantify uncertainty, we introduce a Bayesian anomaly scoring mechanism that evolves over time, using both static and online priors.

Substantial progress has been made through domain representation learning to capture domain-specific information, thus enabling domain-aware decision making. We analyze the process of learning domain representations through dynamical prediction and find that selecting contexts adjacent to the current step causes the learned representations to entangle static domain information with varying dynamical properties. Such mixture can confuse the conditioned policy, thereby constraining zero-shot adaptation. To tackle the challenge, we propose DADP (Domain Adaptive Diffusion Policy), which achieves robust adaptation through unsupervised disentanglement and domain-aware diffusion injection. First, we introduce Lagged Context Dynamical Prediction, a strategy that conditions future state estimation on a historical offset context; by increasing this temporal gap, we unsupervisedly disentangle static domain representations by filtering out transient properties. Second, we integrate the learned domain representations directly into the generative process by biasing the prior distribution and reformulating the diffusion target. Extensive experiments on challenging benchmarks across locomotion and manipulation demonstrate the superior performance, and the generalizability of DADP over prior methods.

Existing approaches primarily assess robustness by comparing model outputs under transformed inputs, offering limited insight into how geometric information is organized within internal representations and failing to distinguish between information loss and re-encoding. In this work, we introduce SEIS (Subspace-based Equivariance and Invariance Scores), a subspace metric for analyzing layer-wise feature representations under geometric transformations, disentangling equivariance from invariance without requiring labels or explicit knowledge of the transformation. Synthetic validation confirms that SEIS correctly recovers known transformations. Applied to trained classification networks, SEIS reveals a transition from equivariance in early layers to invariance in deeper layers, and that data augmentation increases invariance while preserving equivariance. We further show that multi-task learning induces synergistic gains in both properties at the shared encoder, and skip connections restore equivariance lost during decoding.", "AI": {"tldr": "SEIS\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u5ea6\u91cf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5206\u6790\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u5728\u51e0\u4f55\u53d8\u6362\u4e0b\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u533a\u5206\u7b49\u53d8\u6027\u548c\u4e0d\u53d8\u6027\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u6807\u7b7e\u6216\u53d8\u6362\u77e5\u8bc6\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3b\u8981\u901a\u8fc7\u6bd4\u8f83\u53d8\u6362\u8f93\u5165\u4e0b\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u8f93\u51fa\u6765\u8bc4\u4f30\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u65e0\u6cd5\u6df1\u5165\u4e86\u89e3\u51e0\u4f55\u4fe1\u606f\u5728\u5185\u90e8\u8868\u793a\u4e2d\u7684\u7ec4\u7ec7\u65b9\u5f0f\uff0c\u4e5f\u65e0\u6cd5\u533a\u5206\u4fe1\u606f\u4e22\u5931\u4e0e\u91cd\u65b0\u7f16\u7801\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faSEIS\uff08\u57fa\u4e8e\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u7b49\u53d8\u6027\u548c\u4e0d\u53d8\u6027\u8bc4\u5206\uff09\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u5ea6\u91cf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5206\u6790\u5c42\u95f4\u7279\u5f81\u8868\u793a\u5728\u51e0\u4f55\u53d8\u6362\u4e0b\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u89e3\u8026\u7b49\u53d8\u6027\u548c\u4e0d\u53d8\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5408\u6210\u9a8c\u8bc1\u8868\u660eSEIS\u80fd\u6b63\u786e\u6062\u590d\u5df2\u77e5\u53d8\u6362\uff1b\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u8bad\u7ec3\u597d\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\u7f51\u7edc\u663e\u793a\uff1a\u65e9\u671f\u5c42\u5448\u73b0\u7b49\u53d8\u6027\uff0c\u6df1\u5c42\u5448\u73b0\u4e0d\u53d8\u6027\uff1b\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u589e\u52a0\u4e0d\u53d8\u6027\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u7b49\u53d8\u6027\uff1b\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u5171\u4eab\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u4e2d\u534f\u540c\u63d0\u5347\u4e24\u79cd\u5c5e\u6027\uff1b\u8df3\u8dc3\u8fde\u63a5\u6062\u590d\u89e3\u7801\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u4e22\u5931\u7684\u7b49\u53d8\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "SEIS\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u76d1\u7763\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u5206\u6790\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u8868\u793a\u4e2d\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u7f51\u7edc\u5982\u4f55\u5904\u7406\u51e0\u4f55\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u8868\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

Although classical algorithms, e.g., Dijkstra's algorithm, provide exact answers, their latency is prohibitive for modern real-time, large-scale deployments. Over the past two decades, numerous distance indexes have been proposed to speed up query processing for shortest distance queries. More recently, with the advancement in machine learning (ML), researchers have designed and proposed ML-based distance indexes to answer approximate shortest path and distance queries efficiently. However, a comprehensive and systematic evaluation of these ML-based approaches is lacking. This paper presents the first empirical survey of ML-based distance indexes on road networks, evaluating them along four key dimensions: Training time, query latency, storage, and accuracy. Using seven real-world road networks and workload-driven query datasets derived from trajectory data, we benchmark ten representative ML techniques and compare them against strong classical non-ML baselines, highlighting key insights and practical trade-offs. We release a unified open-source codebase to support reproducibility and future research on learned distance indexes.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u9996\u6b21\u5bf9\u57fa\u4e8e\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u9053\u8def\u7f51\u7edc\u8ddd\u79bb\u7d22\u5f15\u8fdb\u884c\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5b9e\u8bc1\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e8610\u79cdML\u6280\u672f\u4e0e\u7ecf\u5178\u975eML\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u95f4\u3001\u67e5\u8be2\u5ef6\u8fdf\u3001\u5b58\u50a8\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u56db\u4e2a\u7ef4\u5ea6\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "motivation": "\u9053\u8def\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u6700\u77ed\u8def\u5f84\u8ddd\u79bb\u8ba1\u7b97\u662f\u5bfc\u822a\u7cfb\u7edf\u3001\u4f4d\u7f6e\u670d\u52a1\u548c\u7a7a\u95f4\u5206\u6790\u7684\u6838\u5fc3\u64cd\u4f5c\u3002\u867d\u7136\u7ecf\u5178\u7b97\u6cd5\uff08\u5982Dijkstra\u7b97\u6cd5\uff09\u80fd\u63d0\u4f9b\u7cbe\u786e\u7b54\u6848\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u5ef6\u8fdf\u5bf9\u4e8e\u73b0\u4ee3\u5b9e\u65f6\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u90e8\u7f72\u6765\u8bf4\u8fc7\u9ad8\u3002\u8fd1\u5e74\u6765\uff0c\u968f\u7740\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u4eba\u5458\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8eML\u7684\u8ddd\u79bb\u7d22\u5f15\u6765\u9ad8\u6548\u56de\u7b54\u8fd1\u4f3c\u6700\u77ed\u8def\u5f84\u548c\u8ddd\u79bb\u67e5\u8be2\uff0c\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u8fd9\u4e9bML\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5168\u9762\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u4e03\u4e2a\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u9053\u8def\u7f51\u7edc\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u8f68\u8ff9\u6570\u636e\u7684\u5de5\u4f5c\u8d1f\u8f7d\u9a71\u52a8\u67e5\u8be2\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5bf9\u5341\u79cd\u4ee3\u8868\u6027ML\u6280\u672f\u8fdb\u884c\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u5e76\u4e0e\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u7ecf\u5178\u975eML\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u8fdb\u884c\u6bd4\u8f83\u3002\u8bc4\u4f30\u6cbf\u56db\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u7ef4\u5ea6\u8fdb\u884c\uff1a\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u95f4\u3001\u67e5\u8be2\u5ef6\u8fdf\u3001\u5b58\u50a8\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5bf9ML\u8ddd\u79bb\u7d22\u5f15\u7684\u5168\u9762\u5b9e\u8bc1\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5173\u952e\u89c1\u89e3\u548c\u5b9e\u9645\u6743\u8861\u3002\u4f5c\u8005\u53d1\u5e03\u4e86\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u5f00\u6e90\u4ee3\u7801\u5e93\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u53ef\u91cd\u590d\u6027\u548c\u672a\u6765\u5bf9\u5b66\u4e60\u8ddd\u79bb\u7d22\u5f15\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fd9\u662f\u9996\u6b21\u5bf9\u57fa\u4e8e\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u9053\u8def\u7f51\u7edc\u8ddd\u79bb\u7d22\u5f15\u8fdb\u884c\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5b9e\u8bc1\u8c03\u67e5\uff0c\u586b\u8865\u4e86\u8be5\u9886\u57df\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u7a7a\u767d\uff0c\u4e3a\u7814\u7a76\u4eba\u5458\u548c\u5b9e\u8df5\u8005\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\u548c\u57fa\u51c6\u3002"}}

Here we present the Brain-LLM Unified Model (BLUM), a framework that leverages lesion-symptom mapping, the gold standard for establishing causal brain-behavior relationships for over a century, as an external reference structure for evaluating LLM perturbation effects. Using data from individuals with chronic post-stroke aphasia (N = 410), we trained symptom-to-lesion models that predict brain damage location from behavioral error profiles, applied systematic perturbations to transformer layers, administered identical clinical assessments to perturbed LLMs and human patients, and projected LLM error profiles into human lesion space. LLM error profiles were sufficiently similar to human error profiles that predicted lesions corresponded to actual lesions in error-matched humans above chance in 67% of picture naming conditions (p < 10^{-23}) and 68.3% of sentence completion conditions (p < 10^{-61}), with semantic-dominant errors mapping onto ventral-stream lesion patterns and phonemic-dominant errors onto dorsal-stream patterns.

Yet, despite these advances, critical challenges remain -- most notably, ensuring robustness to small input perturbations and generalization to out-of-distribution data. These critical challenges underscore the need to understand the underlying fundamental principles that govern robustness and generalization. Among the theoretical tools available, Lipschitz continuity plays a pivotal role in governing the fundamental properties of neural networks related to robustness and generalization. It quantifies the worst-case sensitivity of network's outputs to small input perturbations. While its importance is widely acknowledged, prior research has predominantly focused on empirical regularization approaches based on Lipschitz constraints, leaving the underlying principles less explored. This thesis seeks to advance a principled understanding of the principles of Lipschitz continuity in neural networks within the paradigm of machine learning, examined from two complementary perspectives: an internal perspective -- focusing on the temporal evolution of Lipschitz continuity in neural networks during training (i.e., training dynamics); and an external perspective -- investigating how Lipschitz continuity modulates the behavior of neural networks with respect to features in the input data, particularly its role in governing frequency signal propagation (i.e., modulation of frequency signal propagation).", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u91cd\u70b9\u7814\u7a76Lipschitz\u8fde\u7eed\u6027\u5728\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u7684\u539f\u7406\u6027\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u4ece\u8bad\u7ec3\u52a8\u6001\u548c\u9891\u7387\u4fe1\u53f7\u4f20\u64ad\u4e24\u4e2a\u4e92\u8865\u89c6\u89d2\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u6790\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u6210\u529f\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u9762\u5bf9\u8f93\u5165\u6270\u52a8\u548c\u5206\u5e03\u5916\u6570\u636e\u65f6\u4ecd\u5b58\u5728\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u6311\u6218\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u591a\u5173\u6ce8\u57fa\u4e8eLipschitz\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u7ecf\u9a8c\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u800c\u5bf9\u5176\u5e95\u5c42\u539f\u7406\u63a2\u7d22\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4ece\u66f4\u57fa\u7840\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u5c42\u9762\u7406\u89e3Lipschitz\u8fde\u7eed\u6027\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u4e24\u4e2a\u4e92\u8865\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u89c6\u89d2\uff1a1\uff09\u5185\u90e8\u89c6\u89d2\uff1a\u5206\u6790\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u8bad\u7ec3\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2dLipschitz\u8fde\u7eed\u6027\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u6f14\u5316\uff08\u8bad\u7ec3\u52a8\u6001\uff09\uff1b2\uff09\u5916\u90e8\u89c6\u89d2\uff1a\u7814\u7a76Lipschitz\u8fde\u7eed\u6027\u5982\u4f55\u8c03\u8282\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u5bf9\u8f93\u5165\u6570\u636e\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5176\u5728\u63a7\u5236\u9891\u7387\u4fe1\u53f7\u4f20\u64ad\u4e2d\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "result": "\u8bba\u6587\u672a\u63d0\u4f9b\u5177\u4f53\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u4f46\u4ece\u6458\u8981\u53ef\u63a8\u65ad\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u5c06\u5efa\u7acbLipschitz\u8fde\u7eed\u6027\u4e0e\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3001\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u8054\u7cfb\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u8bad\u7ec3\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2dLipschitz\u7279\u6027\u7684\u6f14\u5316\u89c4\u5f8b\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5176\u5bf9\u9891\u7387\u4fe1\u53f7\u4f20\u64ad\u7684\u8c03\u5236\u673a\u5236\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u4ece\u5185\u90e8\u8bad\u7ec3\u52a8\u6001\u548c\u5916\u90e8\u9891\u7387\u4fe1\u53f7\u4f20\u64ad\u4e24\u4e2a\u89d2\u5ea6\u7cfb\u7edf\u7814\u7a76Lipschitz\u8fde\u7eed\u6027\uff0c\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u4e3a\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u6df1\u5165\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u4ece\u7ecf\u9a8c\u65b9\u6cd5\u5411\u539f\u7406\u6027\u7406\u89e3\u7684\u8f6c\u53d8\u3002"}}

After demonstrating a stability analysis of the Helmholtz operator, we present our numerical experiments across a wide range of frequencies, benchmarked against other popular data-driven and machine learning approaches for waves. We show that our probabilistic neural operator consistently produces robust predictions with the lowest errors in $L^2$, $H^1$, and energy norms. Moreover, unlike all the other tested deterministic approaches, our framework remarkably captures uncertainties in the input sound speed map propagated to the solution field.

However, concept annotations are expensive to obtain and rarely available at scale within a single data source. Federated learning (FL) could alleviate this limitation by enabling cross-institutional training that leverages concept annotations distributed across multiple data owners. Yet, FL lacks interpretable modeling paradigms. Integrating CMs with FL is non-trivial: CMs assume a fixed concept space and a predefined model architecture, whereas real-world FL is heterogeneous and non-stationary, with institutions joining over time and bringing new supervision. In this work, we propose Federated Concept-based Models (F-CMs), a new methodology for deploying CMs in evolving FL settings. F-CMs aggregate concept-level information across institutions and efficiently adapt the model architecture in response to changes in the available concept supervision, while preserving institutional privacy. Empirically, F-CMs preserve the accuracy and intervention effectiveness of training settings with full concept supervision, while outperforming non-adaptive federated baselines.

This creates cascade effects where initial inconsistencies misguide the remaining generation. Existing revision strategies attempt to mitigate this by relying on static confidence scores, but these signals are inherently myopic; inconsistent tokens can appear confident to the model itself. We propose Context-Robust Remasking (CoRe), a training-free framework for inference-time revision. Rather than trusting static token probabilities, CoRe identifies context-brittle tokens by probing their sensitivity to targeted masked-context perturbations. We formalize revision as a robust optimization objective over context shifts and efficiently approximate this objective to prioritize unstable tokens for revision.

However, recent evidence shows that perplexity can be unreliable, especially when irrelevant long inputs are used, raising concerns for both benchmarking and system deployment. While prior efforts have employed selective input filtering and curated datasets, the impact of input length on perplexity has not been systematically studied from a systems perspective and input length has rarely been treated as a first-class system variable affecting both fairness and efficiency. In this work, we close this gap by introducing LengthBenchmark, a system-conscious evaluation framework that explicitly integrates input length, evaluation protocol design, and system-level costs, evaluating representative LLMs under two scoring protocols (direct accumulation and fixed window sliding) across varying context lengths. Unlike prior work that focuses solely on accuracy-oriented metrics, LengthBenchmark additionally measures latency, memory footprint, and evaluation cost, thereby linking predictive metrics to deployment realities. We further incorporate quantized variants not as a main contribution, but as robustness checks, showing that length-induced biases persist across both full-precision and compressed models. This design disentangles the effects of evaluation logic, quantization, and input length, and demonstrates that length bias is a general phenomenon that undermines fair cross-model comparison. Our analysis yields two key observations: (i) sliding window evaluation consistently inflates performance on short inputs, and (ii) both full-precision and quantized models appear to realise gains as the evaluated segment length grows.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51faLengthBenchmark\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u7814\u7a76\u8f93\u5165\u957f\u5ea6\u5bf9LLM\u56f0\u60d1\u5ea6\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u957f\u5ea6\u504f\u5dee\u666e\u904d\u5b58\u5728\u4e14\u5f71\u54cd\u8de8\u6a21\u578b\u516c\u5e73\u6bd4\u8f83", "motivation": "\u56f0\u60d1\u5ea6\u4f5c\u4e3aLLM\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u5e38\u7528\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u5728\u5904\u7406\u957f\u8f93\u5165\u65f6\u4e0d\u53ef\u9760\uff0c\u4f46\u8f93\u5165\u957f\u5ea6\u5bf9\u56f0\u60d1\u5ea6\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u5c1a\u672a\u4ece\u7cfb\u7edf\u89d2\u5ea6\u7cfb\u7edf\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u4e5f\u5f88\u5c11\u88ab\u89c6\u4e3a\u5f71\u54cd\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u548c\u6548\u7387\u7684\u9996\u8981\u7cfb\u7edf\u53d8\u91cf", "method": "\u63d0\u51faLengthBenchmark\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u8f93\u5165\u957f\u5ea6\u3001\u8bc4\u4f30\u534f\u8bae\u8bbe\u8ba1\u548c\u7cfb\u7edf\u7ea7\u6210\u672c\u660e\u786e\u6574\u5408\uff0c\u5728\u4e24\u79cd\u8bc4\u5206\u534f\u8bae\uff08\u76f4\u63a5\u7d2f\u79ef\u548c\u56fa\u5b9a\u7a97\u53e3\u6ed1\u52a8\uff09\u4e0b\u8bc4\u4f30\u4ee3\u8868\u6027LLM\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u957f\u5ea6\u4e0b\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u5e76\u6d4b\u91cf\u5ef6\u8fdf\u3001\u5185\u5b58\u5360\u7528\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\u6210\u672c", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u4e24\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u89c2\u5bdf\uff1a(i)\u6ed1\u52a8\u7a97\u53e3\u8bc4\u4f30\u5728\u77ed\u8f93\u5165\u4e0a\u6301\u7eed\u5938\u5927\u6027\u80fd\uff0c(ii)\u5168\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u91cf\u5316\u6a21\u578b\u968f\u7740\u8bc4\u4f30\u7247\u6bb5\u957f\u5ea6\u589e\u52a0\u90fd\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u957f\u5ea6\u504f\u5dee\u662f\u666e\u904d\u73b0\u8c61", "conclusion": "\u957f\u5ea6\u504f\u5dee\u662f\u666e\u904d\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u4f1a\u7834\u574f\u8de8\u6a21\u578b\u516c\u5e73\u6bd4\u8f83\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u7cfb\u7edf\u7ea7\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u8003\u8651\u8f93\u5165\u957f\u5ea6\u5bf9\u8bc4\u4f30\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u548c\u6548\u7387\u7684\u5f71\u54cd"}}

Our bounds explicitly characterize the degree of overfitting of the learning algorithm and the mismatch between its inductive bias and the task as distinct terms.

We fully characterize these spurious solutions in the common regime where data concentrate on low-dimensional manifold: the objective is underconstrained off the data manifold, while the on-manifold transport signal remains identifiable. Following Choi, Choi, and Kwon (2025), we study additive-noise smoothing as a remedy and prove new map recovery guarantees as the noise vanishes. Our main practical contribution is a computable terminal noise level $\\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{stat}}(N)$ that attains the optimal statistical rate, with scaling governed by the intrinsic dimension $m$ of the data. The formula arises from a theoretical unified analysis of (i) quantitative stability of optimal plans, (ii) smoothing-induced bias, and (iii) finite-sample error, yielding rates that depend on $m$ rather than the ambient dimension. Finally, we show that the reduced semi-dual objective becomes increasingly ill-conditioned as $\\varepsilon \\downarrow 0$.

Data-driven discovery methods address this challenge by inferring governing equations from time-series data using a library of functions constructed from the measured variables. However, these methods typically assume time-invariant coefficients, which limits their ability to capture evolving system dynamics. To overcome this limitation, we allow some of the parameters to vary over time, learn their temporal evolution directly from data, and infer a system of equations that incorporates both constant and time-varying parameters. We then transform this framework into a forecasting model by predicting the time-varying parameters and substituting these predictions into the learned equations. The model is validated using datasets for Susceptible-Infected-Recovered, Consumer--Resource, greenhouse gas concentration, and Cyanobacteria cell count. By dynamically adapting to temporal shifts, our proposed model achieved a mean absolute error below 3\\% for learning a time series and below 6\\% for forecasting up to a month ahead. We additionally compare forecasting performance against CNN-LSTM and Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM), and show that our model outperforms these methods across most datasets. Our findings demonstrate that integrating time-varying parameters into data-driven discovery of differential equations improves both modeling accuracy and forecasting performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u65f6\u53d8\u53c2\u6570\u6765\u53d1\u73b0\u590d\u6742\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5fae\u5206\u65b9\u7a0b\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u5176\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u5047\u8bbe\u53c2\u6570\u65f6\u4e0d\u53d8\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u6355\u6349\u7cfb\u7edf\u52a8\u6001\u6f14\u5316\u3002\u5f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u673a\u5236\u672a\u77e5\u4e14\u53c2\u6570\u968f\u65f6\u95f4\u53d8\u5316\u65f6\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u5141\u8bb8\u90e8\u5206\u53c2\u6570\u968f\u65f6\u95f4\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u76f4\u63a5\u4ece\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e60\u5176\u65f6\u53d8\u6f14\u5316\uff0c\u63a8\u65ad\u5305\u542b\u5e38\u53c2\u6570\u548c\u65f6\u53d8\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u65b9\u7a0b\u3002\u7136\u540e\u5c06\u6b64\u6846\u67b6\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9884\u6d4b\u65f6\u53d8\u53c2\u6570\u5e76\u4ee3\u5165\u5b66\u4e60\u5230\u7684\u65b9\u7a0b\u8fdb\u884c\u9884\u6d4b\u3002", "result": "\u5728SIR\u3001\u6d88\u8d39\u8005-\u8d44\u6e90\u3001\u6e29\u5ba4\u6c14\u4f53\u6d53\u5ea6\u548c\u84dd\u85fb\u7ec6\u80de\u8ba1\u6570\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u5b66\u4e60\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u7684\u5e73\u5747\u7edd\u5bf9\u8bef\u5dee\u4f4e\u4e8e3%\uff0c\u63d0\u524d\u4e00\u4e2a\u6708\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u8bef\u5dee\u4f4e\u4e8e6%\u3002\u76f8\u6bd4CNN-LSTM\u548c\u68af\u5ea6\u63d0\u5347\u673a\uff0c\u5728\u5927\u591a\u6570\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u4f18\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5c06\u65f6\u53d8\u53c2\u6570\u6574\u5408\u5230\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u5fae\u5206\u65b9\u7a0b\u53d1\u73b0\u4e2d\uff0c\u80fd\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u9ad8\u5efa\u6a21\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u9002\u5e94\u7cfb\u7edf\u52a8\u6001\u53d8\u5316\u3002"}}

However, they mainly focus on Text-Attributed Graphs (TAGs), leaving Multimodal-Attributed Graphs (MAGs) largely untapped. Developing Multimodal Graph Foundation Models (MGFMs) allows for leveraging the rich multimodal information in MAGs, and extends applicability to broader types of downstream tasks. While recent MGFMs integrate diverse modality information, our empirical investigation reveals two fundamental limitations of existing MGFMs: (1)they fail to explicitly model modality interaction, essential for capturing intricate cross-modal semantics beyond simple aggregation, and (2)they exhibit sub-optimal modality alignment, which is critical for bridging the significant semantic disparity between distinct modal spaces. To address these challenges, we propose PLANET (graPh topoLogy-aware modAlity iNteraction and alignmEnT), a novel framework employing a Divide-and-Conquer strategy to decouple modality interaction and alignment across distinct granularities. At the embedding granularity, (1)Embedding-wise Domain Gating (EDG) performs local semantic enrichment by adaptively infusing topology-aware cross-modal context, achieving modality interaction. At the node granularity, (2)Node-wise Discretization Retrieval (NDR) ensures global modality alignment by constructing a Discretized Semantic Representation Space (DSRS) to bridge modality gaps.

Some work even trains low-rank parameterizations for reasoning, but conventional LoRA cannot scale below the model dimension. We question whether even rank=1 LoRA is necessary for learning to reason and propose TinyLoRA, a method for scaling low-rank adapters to sizes as small as one parameter.

Previous works have leveraged Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNets) to impose hard synthesizability constraints through the design of state and action spaces based on predefined reaction templates and building blocks. Despite the promising prospects of this approach, it currently lacks flexibility and scalability. As an alternative, we propose S3-GFN, which generates synthesizable SMILES molecules via simple soft regularization of a sequence-based GFlowNet. Our approach leverages rich molecular priors learned from large-scale SMILES corpora to steer molecular generation towards high-reward, synthesizable chemical spaces. The model induces constraints through off-policy replay training with a contrastive learning signal based on separate buffers of synthesizable and unsynthesizable samples. Our experiments show that S3-GFN learns to generate synthesizable molecules ($\\geq 95\\%$) with higher rewards in diverse tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "S3-GFN\uff1a\u901a\u8fc7\u5e8f\u5217\u5f0fGFlowNet\u7684\u7b80\u5355\u8f6f\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u751f\u6210\u53ef\u5408\u6210SMILES\u5206\u5b50\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u786c\u6027\u5408\u6210\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u53ef\u5408\u6210\u6027\uff08\u226595%\uff09\u548c\u9ad8\u5956\u52b1\u5206\u5b50\u751f\u6210", "motivation": "\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6027\u836f\u7269\u53d1\u73b0\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u53d7\u5230\u4e25\u91cd\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5b9e\u9645\u53ef\u5408\u6210\u7684\u5168\u65b0\u5206\u5b50\u975e\u5e38\u56f0\u96be\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u786c\u5408\u6210\u7ea6\u675f\uff08\u9884\u5b9a\u4e49\u53cd\u5e94\u6a21\u677f\u548c\u6784\u5efa\u5757\uff09\u7684GFlowNet\u65b9\u6cd5\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faS3-GFN\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5e8f\u5217\u5f0fGFlowNet\u7684\u7b80\u5355\u8f6f\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u751f\u6210\u53ef\u5408\u6210SMILES\u5206\u5b50\u3002\u5229\u7528\u4ece\u5927\u89c4\u6a21SMILES\u8bed\u6599\u5e93\u5b66\u4e60\u5230\u7684\u4e30\u5bcc\u5206\u5b50\u5148\u9a8c\uff0c\u5f15\u5bfc\u5206\u5b50\u751f\u6210\u671d\u5411\u9ad8\u5956\u52b1\u3001\u53ef\u5408\u6210\u7684\u5316\u5b66\u7a7a\u95f4\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u57fa\u4e8e\u53ef\u5408\u6210\u548c\u4e0d\u53ef\u5408\u6210\u6837\u672c\u7f13\u51b2\u533a\u7684\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u4fe1\u53f7\u8fdb\u884c\u79bb\u7b56\u7565\u56de\u653e\u8bad\u7ec3\u6765\u65bd\u52a0\u7ea6\u675f\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660eS3-GFN\u80fd\u591f\u5b66\u4e60\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u53ef\u5408\u6210\u6027\u5206\u5b50\uff08\u226595%\uff09\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u6837\u5316\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u83b7\u5f97\u66f4\u9ad8\u5956\u52b1\u3002", "conclusion": "S3-GFN\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7075\u6d3b\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8f6f\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u800c\u975e\u786c\u7ea6\u675f\u5b9e\u73b0\u53ef\u5408\u6210\u5206\u5b50\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u514b\u670d\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002"}}

However, the role of the discount factor is often overlooked, as it is typically treated as a fixed parameter of the Markov decision process or tunable hyperparameter, with little consideration of its effect on the learned policy. In the literature, it is well-known that the discounting function plays a major role in characterizing time preferences of an agent, which an exponential discount factor cannot fully capture. Building on this insight, we propose a novel framework that supports flexible discounting of future rewards and optimization of risk measures in distributional RL. We provide a technical analysis of the optimality of our algorithms, show that our multi-horizon extension fixes issues raised with existing methodologies, and validate the robustness of our methods through extensive experiments.

This paper studies the data efficiency for MPRM training.Our preliminary experiments reveal that MPRM training quickly saturates under random subsampling of the training data, indicating substantial redundancy within existing MC-annotated corpora.To explain this, we formalize a theoretical framework and reveal that informative gradient updates depend on two factors: label mixtures of positive/negative steps and label reliability (average MC scores of positive steps). Guided by these insights, we propose the Balanced-Information Score (BIS), which prioritizes both mixture and reliability based on existing MC signals at the rollout level, without incurring any additional cost. Across two backbones (InternVL2.5-8B and Qwen2.5-VL-7B) on VisualProcessBench, BIS-selected subsets consistently match and even surpass the full-data performance at small fractions.

Specifically, our method employs information-theoretic and correlation-based criteria to extract structurally informative subgraphs and features, resulting in a compact, semantically grounded representation. This optimized context is subsequently integrated into a spatiotemporal convolutional architecture to capture complex multivariate dynamics.

While post-training quantization (PTQ) maintains high fidelity at 4-bit, it deteriorates at 2-3 bits. Fundamentally, existing methods enforce a shape-invariant quantization grid (e.g., the fixed uniform intervals of UINT2) for each group, severely restricting the feasible set for error minimization. To address this, we propose Bit-Plane Decomposition Quantization (BPDQ), which constructs a variable quantization grid via bit-planes and scalar coefficients, and iteratively refines them using approximate second-order information while progressively compensating quantization errors to minimize output discrepancy. In the 2-bit regime, BPDQ enables serving Qwen2.5-72B on a single RTX 3090 with 83.85% GSM8K accuracy (vs. 90.83% at 16-bit). Moreover, we provide theoretical analysis showing that the variable grid expands the feasible set, and that the quantization process consistently aligns with the optimization objective in Hessian-induced geometry.

Early pruning decisions can lock the network into a brittle structure that is difficult to escape, especially in deep reinforcement learning (RL) where the evolving policy continually shifts the training distribution. We propose Topology-Aware Revival (TAR), a lightweight one-shot post-pruning procedure that improves static sparsity without dynamic rewiring. After static pruning, TAR performs a single revival step by allocating a small reserve budget across layers according to topology needs, randomly uniformly reactivating a few previously pruned connections within each layer, and then keeping the resulting connectivity fixed for the remainder of training. Across multiple continuous-control tasks with SAC and TD3, TAR improves final return over static sparse baselines by up to +37.9% and also outperforms dynamic sparse training baselines with a median gain of +13.5%.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faTAR\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u9759\u6001\u7a00\u758f\u8bad\u7ec3\u540e\u8fdb\u884c\u4e00\u6b21\u6027\u7684\u8fde\u63a5\u590d\u6d3b\uff0c\u6539\u5584\u6df1\u5ea6\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u9759\u6001\u7a00\u758f\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u6027\u80fd", "motivation": "\u9759\u6001\u7a00\u758f\u8bad\u7ec3\u867d\u7136\u9ad8\u6548\uff0c\u4f46\u56fa\u5b9a\u7684\u63a9\u7801\u6a21\u5f0f\u4f1a\u964d\u4f4e\u7f51\u7edc\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002\u65e9\u671f\u526a\u679d\u51b3\u7b56\u53ef\u80fd\u5c06\u7f51\u7edc\u9501\u5b9a\u5728\u8106\u5f31\u7ed3\u6784\u4e2d\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u6df1\u5ea6\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\uff0c\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u4e0d\u65ad\u6f14\u5316\u4f1a\u6301\u7eed\u6539\u53d8\u8bad\u7ec3\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u4f7f\u5f97\u7f51\u7edc\u96be\u4ee5\u9002\u5e94", "method": "TAR\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u7684\u4e00\u6b21\u6027\u540e\u526a\u679d\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u4e09\u4e2a\u6b65\u9aa4\uff1a1\uff09\u6839\u636e\u62d3\u6251\u9700\u6c42\u5728\u5404\u5c42\u5206\u914d\u5c0f\u89c4\u6a21\u9884\u7b97\uff1b2\uff09\u5728\u5404\u5c42\u5185\u968f\u673a\u5747\u5300\u5730\u91cd\u65b0\u6fc0\u6d3b\u5c11\u91cf\u5148\u524d\u88ab\u526a\u679d\u7684\u8fde\u63a5\uff1b3\uff09\u4fdd\u6301\u7ed3\u679c\u8fde\u63a5\u6027\u56fa\u5b9a\u8fdb\u884c\u540e\u7eed\u8bad\u7ec3", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u8fde\u7eed\u63a7\u5236\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0cTAR\u76f8\u6bd4\u9759\u6001\u7a00\u758f\u57fa\u7ebf\u5c06\u6700\u7ec8\u56de\u62a5\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u6700\u9ad837.9%\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u52a8\u6001\u7a00\u758f\u8bad\u7ec3\u57fa\u7ebf\u4e5f\u6709\u4e2d\u4f4d\u657013.5%\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347", "conclusion": "TAR\u901a\u8fc7\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u8fde\u63a5\u590d\u6d3b\u673a\u5236\u6709\u6548\u6539\u5584\u4e86\u9759\u6001\u7a00\u758f\u8bad\u7ec3\u5728\u6df1\u5ea6\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u590d\u6742\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u91cd\u8fde\uff0c\u4e3a\u9ad8\u6548\u7a00\u758f\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848"}}

Yet, current evaluations of reconstruction quality emphasize point-estimate accuracy metrics on a single sample, which do not reflect the stochastic nature of PnPDP solvers and the intrinsic uncertainty of inverse problems, critical for scientific tasks. This creates a fundamental mismatch: in inverse problems, the desired output is typically a posterior distribution and most PnPDP solvers induce a distribution over reconstructions, but existing benchmarks only evaluate a single reconstruction, ignoring distributional characterization such as uncertainty. To address this gap, we conduct a systematic study to benchmark the uncertainty quantification (UQ) of existing diffusion inverse solvers. Specifically, we design a rigorous toy model simulation to evaluate the uncertainty behavior of various PnPDP solvers, and propose a UQ-driven categorization.

We introduce LORE (Low Rank Ordinal Embedding), a scalable framework that jointly learns both the intrinsic dimensionality and an ordinal embedding from noisy triplet comparisons of the form, \"Is A more similar to B than C?\". Unlike existing methods that require the embedding dimension to be set apriori, LORE regularizes the solution using the nonconvex Schatten-$p$ quasi norm, enabling automatic joint recovery of both the ordinal embedding and its dimensionality.

Using the Fourier Multi-Component and Multi-Layer Neural Network (FMMNN) as the INR backbone improves representation of complex spatial fields and yields more stable optimization than sine-based INRs. We provide a conditional theoretical justification: under stable delay observability of point measurements on a low-dimensional parametric invariant set, the reconstruction operator factors through a finite-dimensional embedding, making STRIDE-type architectures natural approximators.

In this work, we attribute these failures to the generalization of the safe reasoning process, particularly their insufficiency against complex attack prompts. We provide both theoretical and empirical evidence to show the necessity of a more sufficient safe reasoning process to defend against advanced attack prompts. Building on this insight, we propose a Risk-Aware Preference Optimization (RAPO) framework that enables LRM to adaptively identify and address the safety risks with appropriate granularity in its thinking content.

Hence, incomplete verifiers are widely used because they scale efficiently and substantially reduce the cost of robustness verification compared to complete methods. However, relying on a single verifier can underestimate robustness because of loose approximations or misalignment with training methods. In this work, we propose Cascading Robustness Verification (CRV), which goes beyond an engineering improvement by exposing fundamental limitations of existing robustness metric and introducing a framework that enhances both reliability and efficiency. CRV is a model-agnostic verifier, meaning that its robustness guarantees are independent of the model's training process. The key insight behind the CRV framework is that, when using multiple verification methods, an input is certifiably robust if at least one method certifies it as robust. Rather than relying solely on a single verifier with a fixed constraint set, CRV progressively applies multiple verifiers to balance the tightness of the bound and computational cost. Starting with the least expensive method, CRV halts as soon as an input is certified as robust; otherwise, it proceeds to more expensive methods. For computationally expensive methods, we introduce a Stepwise Relaxation Algorithm (SR) that incrementally adds constraints and checks for certification at each step, thereby avoiding unnecessary computation. Our theoretical analysis demonstrates that CRV achieves equal or higher verified accuracy compared to powerful but computationally expensive incomplete verifiers in the cascade, while significantly reducing verification overhead. Empirical results confirm that CRV certifies at least as many inputs as benchmark approaches, while improving runtime efficiency by up to ~90%.", "AI": {"tldr": "CRV\u63d0\u51fa\u7ea7\u8054\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5668\u7ea7\u8054\u63d0\u5347\u9a8c\u8bc1\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u548c\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u5355\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5668\u53ef\u63d0\u9ad8\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7cbe\u5ea6\u5e76\u51cf\u5c1190%\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u5bf9\u6297\u6837\u672c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5b58\u5728\u6311\u6218\uff1a\u5b8c\u5168\u9a8c\u8bc1\u65b9\u6cd5\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\uff0c\u4e0d\u5b8c\u5168\u9a8c\u8bc1\u65b9\u6cd5\u867d\u9ad8\u6548\u4f46\u53ef\u80fd\u56e0\u8fd1\u4f3c\u677e\u5f1b\u6216\u4e0e\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u800c\u4f4e\u4f30\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002\u4f9d\u8d56\u5355\u4e00\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5668\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7ea7\u8054\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u9a8c\u8bc1(CRV)\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1) \u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u5173\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5668\uff1b2) \u591a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5668\u7ea7\u8054\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u4ece\u6700\u5ec9\u4ef7\u65b9\u6cd5\u5f00\u59cb\uff0c\u4e00\u65e6\u9a8c\u8bc1\u901a\u8fc7\u5373\u505c\u6b62\uff1b3) \u9488\u5bf9\u6602\u8d35\u65b9\u6cd5\u5f15\u5165\u9010\u6b65\u677e\u5f1b\u7b97\u6cd5(SR)\uff0c\u589e\u91cf\u6dfb\u52a0\u7ea6\u675f\u907f\u514d\u4e0d\u5fc5\u8981\u8ba1\u7b97\u3002", "result": "\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u8868\u660eCRV\u80fd\u8fbe\u5230\u6216\u8d85\u8fc7\u7ea7\u8054\u4e2d\u5f3a\u5927\u4f46\u8ba1\u7b97\u6602\u8d35\u7684\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5668\u7684\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5f00\u9500\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5b9eCRV\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u8f93\u5165\u6570\u91cf\u81f3\u5c11\u4e0e\u57fa\u51c6\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u5f53\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u8fd0\u884c\u6548\u7387\u63d0\u5347\u9ad8\u8fbe90%\u3002", "conclusion": "CRV\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5668\u7ea7\u8054\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u9a8c\u8bc1\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u5927\u5e45\u63d0\u5347\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u9a8c\u8bc1\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u5bf9\u6297\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u9a8c\u8bc1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u5b9e\u7528\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

To enhance the consistency of the features from different datasets, we propose a density maximization mean alignment algorithm with guaranteed convergence. The original graphs and generated node embeddings are fed into a graph neural network to achieve discriminative graph representations in contrastive learning. More importantly, to enhance the information preservation from node-level representations to the graph-level representation, we construct a multi-layer reference distribution module without using any pooling operation.

We show that Deep Bernstein Networks (which utilizes Bernstein polynomials as activation functions) can act as residual-free architecture while simultaneously optimize trainability and representation power. We provide a two-fold theoretical foundation for our approach. First, we derive a theoretical lower bound on the local derivative, proving it remains strictly bounded away from zero. This directly addresses the root cause of gradient stagnation; empirically, our architecture reduces ``dead'' neurons from 90\\% in standard deep networks to less than 5\\%, outperforming ReLU, Leaky ReLU, SeLU, and GeLU. Second, we establish that the approximation error for Bernstein-based networks decays exponentially with depth, a significant improvement over the polynomial rates of ReLU-based architectures. By unifying these results, we demonstrate that Bernstein activations provide a superior mechanism for function approximation and signal flow.

In this work, we introduce T2T(Thickening-to-Thinning), a dynamic reward framework inspired by human learning processes. Specifically, it implements a dual-phase mechanism: (1) On incorrect attempts, T2T incentivizes \"thickening\" (longer trajectories) to broaden the search space and explore novel solution paths; (2) Upon achieving correctness, it shifts to \"thinning\", imposing length penalties to discourage redundancy, thereby fostering model confidence and crystallizing reasoning capabilities.

A critical challenge in time-series analysis is to understand how these labels are encoded within the multi-trial observations, and disentangle the distinct effect of each label entry across categories. Here, we present MILCCI, a novel data-driven method that i) identifies the interpretable components underlying the data, ii) captures cross-trial variability, and iii) integrates label information to understand each category's representation within the data. MILCCI extends a sparse per-trial decomposition that leverages label similarities within each category to enable subtle, label-driven cross-trial adjustments in component compositions and to distinguish the contribution of each category. MILCCI also learns each component's corresponding temporal trace, which evolves over time within each trial and varies flexibly across trials.

However, their discontinuous spoke structures present challenges in stiffness tuning, durability, and high speed vibration. This study introduces an integrated generative design and machine learning driven framework to optimize UPTIS type spoke geometries for passenger vehicles. Upper and lower spoke profiles were parameterized using high order polynomial representations, enabling the creation of approximately 250 generative designs through PCHIP based geometric variation. Machine learning models like KRR for stiffness and XGBoost for durability and vibration achieved strong predictive accuracy, reducing the reliance on computationally intensive FEM simulations. Optimization using Particle Swarm Optimization and Bayesian Optimization further enabled extensive performance refinement.

FI-Conv is built on a U-Net architecture, in which most convolutional layers are replaced by ConvNeXt V2 blocks. This design preserves U-Net performance on inputs with high-frequency variations while maintaining low computational complexity. FI-Conv uses an initial state, PDE parameters, and evolution time as input to predict the system future state. As a representative example of a system exhibiting complex dynamics, we evaluate the performance of FI-Conv on the task of predicting turbulent plasma fields governed by the Hasegawa-Wakatani (HW) equations. The HW system models two-dimensional electrostatic drift-wave turbulence and exhibits strongly nonlinear behavior, making accurate approximation and long-term prediction particularly challenging. Using an autoregressive forecasting procedure, FI-Conv achieves accurate forward prediction of the plasma state evolution over short times (t ~ 3) and captures the statistic properties of derived physical quantities of interest over longer times (t ~ 100). Moreover, we develop a gradient-descent-based inverse estimation method that accurately infers PDE parameters from plasma state evolution data, without modifying the trained model weights.

However, the orchestration policies governing expert interaction and sequencing remain largely opaque. We introduce INFORM, an interpretability analysis that treats orchestration as an explicit, analyzable computation, enabling the decoupling of expert interaction structure, execution order, and causal attribution. We use INFORM to evaluate an orchestrator on GSM8K, HumanEval, and MMLU using a homogeneous consortium of ten instruction-tuned experts drawn from LLaMA-3.1 8B, Qwen-3 8B, and DeepSeek-R1 8B, with controlled decoding-temperature variation, and a secondary heterogeneous consortium spanning 1B-7B parameter models. Across tasks, routing dominance is a poor proxy for functional necessity. We reveal a divergence between relational importance, captured by routing mass and interaction topology, and intrinsic importance, measured via gradient-based causal attribution: frequently selected experts often act as interaction hubs with limited causal influence, while sparsely routed experts can be structurally critical. Orchestration behaviors emerge asynchronously, with expert centralization preceding stable routing confidence and expert ordering remaining non-deterministic. Targeted ablations show that masking intrinsically important experts induces disproportionate collapse in interaction structure compared to masking frequent peers, confirming that INFORM exposes causal and structural dependencies beyond accuracy metrics alone.", "AI": {"tldr": "INFORM\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u5206\u6790\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u591a\u4e13\u5bb6LLM\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u7f16\u6392\u89c6\u4e3a\u53ef\u5206\u6790\u7684\u663e\u5f0f\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u8def\u7531\u4e3b\u5bfc\u6027\u4e0e\u529f\u80fd\u5fc5\u8981\u6027\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5173\u7cfb\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u4e0e\u5185\u5728\u56e0\u679c\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5206\u6b67\u3002", "motivation": "\u591a\u4e13\u5bb6LLM\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u590d\u6742\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u7f16\u6392\u7b56\u7565\uff08\u4e13\u5bb6\u4ea4\u4e92\u548c\u6392\u5e8f\uff09\u901a\u5e38\u4e0d\u900f\u660e\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u7f16\u6392\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u5206\u6790\u3002", "method": "INFORM\u6846\u67b6\u5c06\u7f16\u6392\u89c6\u4e3a\u663e\u5f0f\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u89e3\u8026\u4e13\u5bb6\u4ea4\u4e92\u7ed3\u6784\u3001\u6267\u884c\u987a\u5e8f\u548c\u56e0\u679c\u5f52\u56e0\u3002\u4f7f\u7528\u540c\u8d28\uff0810\u4e2a\u6307\u4ee4\u8c03\u4f18\u4e13\u5bb6\uff09\u548c\u5f02\u8d28\uff081B-7B\u53c2\u6570\u6a21\u578b\uff09\u4e13\u5bb6\u8054\u76df\uff0c\u5728GSM8K\u3001HumanEval\u548cMMLU\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30\u7f16\u6392\u5668\u3002", "result": "\u8def\u7531\u4e3b\u5bfc\u6027\u4e0d\u80fd\u4ee3\u8868\u529f\u80fd\u5fc5\u8981\u6027\uff1b\u5173\u7cfb\u91cd\u8981\u6027\uff08\u8def\u7531\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u4ea4\u4e92\u62d3\u6251\uff09\u4e0e\u5185\u5728\u91cd\u8981\u6027\uff08\u57fa\u4e8e\u68af\u5ea6\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u5f52\u56e0\uff09\u5b58\u5728\u5206\u6b67\uff1b\u9891\u7e41\u9009\u62e9\u7684\u4e13\u5bb6\u5e38\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4ea4\u4e92\u67a2\u7ebd\u4f46\u56e0\u679c\u5f71\u54cd\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u800c\u7a00\u758f\u8def\u7531\u7684\u4e13\u5bb6\u53ef\u80fd\u7ed3\u6784\u5173\u952e\uff1b\u7f16\u6392\u884c\u4e3a\u5f02\u6b65\u51fa\u73b0\uff0c\u4e13\u5bb6\u96c6\u4e2d\u5316\u5148\u4e8e\u7a33\u5b9a\u8def\u7531\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "INFORM\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u7f16\u6392\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u8d85\u8d8a\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u6307\u6807\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u548c\u7ed3\u6784\u4f9d\u8d56\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u9891\u7e41\u8def\u7531\u7684\u4e13\u5bb6\u4e0d\u4e00\u5b9a\u662f\u529f\u80fd\u5fc5\u8981\u7684\uff0c\u800c\u7a00\u758f\u8def\u7531\u7684\u4e13\u5bb6\u53ef\u80fd\u5bf9\u7cfb\u7edf\u7ed3\u6784\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002"}}

We theoretically show that Mosaic Learning (i) shows state-of-the-art worst-case convergence rate, and (ii) leverages parameter correlation in an ML model, improving contraction by reducing the highest eigenvalue of a simplified system. We empirically evaluate Mosaic Learning on four learning tasks and observe up to 12 percentage points higher node-level test accuracy compared to epidemic learning (EL), a state-of-the-art baseline.

However, full-set fine-tuning MLLMs to assess such gains incurs significant time costs, hindering the iterative refinement cycles of the ChartU dataset. Reviewing the ChartU dataset synthesis and data selection domains, we find that subsets can potentially probe the MLLMs' capability gains from full-set fine-tuning. Given that data diversity is vital for boosting MLLMs' performance and entropy reflects this feature, we propose EXaMCaP, which uses entropy gain maximization to select a subset. To obtain a high-diversity subset, EXaMCaP chooses the maximum-entropy subset from the large ChartU dataset. As enumerating all possible subsets is impractical, EXaMCaP iteratively selects samples to maximize the gain in set entropy relative to the current set, approximating the maximum-entropy subset of the full dataset.

The core idea lies in effectively aligning the modality between natural language and time series. However, the multi-scale structures of natural language and time series have not been fully considered, resulting in insufficient utilization of LLMs capabilities. To this end, we propose MSH-LLM, a Multi-Scale Hypergraph method that aligns Large Language Models for time series analysis. Specifically, a hyperedging mechanism is designed to enhance the multi-scale semantic information of time series semantic space. Then, a cross-modality alignment (CMA) module is introduced to align the modality between natural language and time series at different scales. In addition, a mixture of prompts (MoP) mechanism is introduced to provide contextual information and enhance the ability of LLMs to understand the multi-scale temporal patterns of time series.

However, collecting new labelled data at each time step remains expensive and logistically difficult, especially in dynamic or remote ecological systems. As a response to this challenge, we demonstrate that a model with access to reference data solely from time step t0 can perform competitively on both t0 and a future time step t1, outperforming models trained separately on time-specific reference data (the gold standard). This finding suggests that effective temporal generalization can be achieved without requiring manual updates to reference labels beyond the initial time step t0. Drawing on concepts from change detection and semi-supervised learning (SSL), the most performant approach, \"Common Ground\", uses a semi-supervised framework that leverages temporally stable regions-areas with little to no change in spectral or semantic characteristics between time steps-as a source of implicit supervision for dynamic regions. We evaluate this strategy across multiple classifiers, sensors (Landsat-8, Sentinel-2 satellite multispectral and airborne imaging spectroscopy), and ecological use cases. For invasive tree species mapping, we observed a 21-40% improvement in classification accuracy using Common Ground compared to naive temporal transfer, where models trained at a single time step are directly applied to a future time step. We also observe a 10 -16% higher accuracy for the introduced approach compared to a gold-standard approach. In contrast, when broad land cover categories were mapped across Europe, we observed a more modest 2% increase in accuracy compared to both the naive and gold-standard approaches.

Despite extensive exploration of reward processing strategies and training dynamics, all existing group-based methods exclusively use KL divergence for policy regularization, leaving the choice of divergence function unexplored. We introduce Group-Based Mirror Policy Optimization (GBMPO), a framework that extends group-based policy optimization to flexible Bregman divergences, including hand-designed alternatives (L2 in probability space) and learned neural mirror maps. On GSM8K mathematical reasoning, hand-designed ProbL2-GRPO achieves 86.7% accuracy, improving +5.5 points over the Dr. GRPO baseline. On MBPP code generation, neural mirror maps reach 60.1-60.8% pass@1, with random initialization already capturing most of the benefit. While evolutionary strategies meta-learning provides marginal accuracy improvements, its primary value lies in variance reduction ($\\pm$0.2 versus $\\pm$0.6) and efficiency gains (15% shorter responses on MBPP), suggesting that random initialization of neural mirror maps is sufficient for most practical applications. These results establish divergence choice as a critical, previously unexplored design dimension in group-based policy optimization for LLM reasoning.", "AI": {"tldr": "GBMPO\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u7fa4\u4f53\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u7075\u6d3b\u7684Bregman\u6563\u5ea6\uff08\u5305\u62ec\u624b\u5de5\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684L2\u6982\u7387\u7a7a\u95f4\u6563\u5ea6\u548c\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u955c\u50cf\u6620\u5c04\uff09\uff0c\u5728\u6570\u5b66\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528KL\u6563\u5ea6\u7684\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u7fa4\u4f53\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u5982GRPO\uff09\u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528KL\u6563\u5ea6\u8fdb\u884c\u7b56\u7565\u6b63\u5219\u5316\uff0c\u6563\u5ea6\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u9009\u62e9\u8fd9\u4e00\u5173\u952e\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7ef4\u5ea6\u5c1a\u672a\u88ab\u63a2\u7d22\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faGroup-Based Mirror Policy Optimization (GBMPO)\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u57fa\u4e8e\u7fa4\u4f53\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u4f18\u5316\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u7075\u6d3b\u7684Bregman\u6563\u5ea6\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u624b\u5de5\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\uff08\u6982\u7387\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u7684L2\u6563\u5ea6\uff09\u548c\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u955c\u50cf\u6620\u5c04\u3002", "result": "\u5728GSM8K\u6570\u5b66\u63a8\u7406\u4e0a\uff0c\u624b\u5de5\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684ProbL2-GRPO\u8fbe\u523086.7%\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u6bd4Dr. GRPO\u57fa\u7ebf\u63d0\u53475.5\u4e2a\u767e\u5206\u70b9\uff1b\u5728MBPP\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u4e0a\uff0c\u795e\u7ecf\u955c\u50cf\u6620\u5c04\u8fbe\u523060.1-60.8% pass@1\uff1b\u968f\u673a\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u5df2\u80fd\u83b7\u5f97\u5927\u90e8\u5206\u6536\u76ca\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6563\u5ea6\u9009\u62e9\u662f\u57fa\u4e8e\u7fa4\u4f53\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u4f18\u5316\u4e2d\u4e00\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u4e14\u5148\u524d\u672a\u88ab\u63a2\u7d22\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7ef4\u5ea6\uff0c\u968f\u673a\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u795e\u7ecf\u955c\u50cf\u6620\u5c04\u5df2\u8db3\u591f\u5927\u591a\u6570\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u8fdb\u5316\u7b56\u7565\u5143\u5b66\u4e60\u4e3b\u8981\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b9\u5dee\u51cf\u5c11\u548c\u6548\u7387\u63d0\u5347\u3002"}}

While infrequent communication strategies reduce synchronization frequency, they remain bottlenecked by the memory and communication requirements of optimizer states. Low-rank optimizers can alleviate these constraints; however, in the local-update regime, workers lack access to the full-batch gradients required to compute low-rank projections, which degrades performance. We propose $\\texttt{LoRDO}$, a principled framework unifying low-rank optimization with infrequent synchronization. We first demonstrate that, while global projections based on pseudo-gradients are theoretically superior, they permanently restrict the optimization trajectory to a low-rank subspace. To restore subspace exploration, we introduce a full-rank quasi-hyperbolic update. $\\texttt{LoRDO}$ achieves near-parity with low-rank $\\texttt{DDP}$ in language modeling and downstream tasks at model scales of $125$M--$720$M, while reducing communication by $\\approx 10 \\times$.

Recent theoretical work has shown that this backward dynamics can undergo sharp qualitative transitions, known as speciation transitions, during which trajectories become dynamically committed to data classes. Existing theoretical analyses, however, are limited to settings where classes are identifiable through first moments, such as mixtures of Gaussians with well-separated means. In this work, we develop a general theory of speciation in diffusion models that applies to arbitrary target distributions admitting well-defined classes. We formalize the notion of class structure through Bayes classification and characterize speciation times in terms of free-entropy difference between classes. This criterion recovers known results in previously studied Gaussian-mixture models, while extending to situations in which classes are not distinguishable by first moments and may instead differ through higher-order or collective features. Our framework also accommodates multiple classes and predicts the existence of successive speciation times associated with increasingly fine-grained class commitment. We illustrate the theory on two analytically tractable examples: mixtures of one-dimensional Ising models at different temperatures and mixtures of zero-mean Gaussians with distinct covariance structures. In the Ising case, we obtain explicit expressions for speciation times by mapping the problem onto a random-field Ising model and solving it via the replica method. Our results provide a unified and broadly applicable description of speciation transitions in diffusion-based generative models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7269\u79cd\u5f62\u6210\u8f6c\u53d8\u7684\u901a\u7528\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u4efb\u610f\u5177\u6709\u660e\u786e\u5b9a\u4e49\u7c7b\u522b\u7684\u76ee\u6807\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e86\u4ec5\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e00\u9636\u77e9\u7684\u4f20\u7edf\u5206\u6790\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u4ec5\u9650\u4e8e\u7c7b\u522b\u53ef\u901a\u8fc7\u4e00\u9636\u77e9\uff08\u5982\u5747\u503c\u5206\u79bb\u7684\u9ad8\u65af\u6df7\u5408\uff09\u8bc6\u522b\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u5904\u7406\u7c7b\u522b\u901a\u8fc7\u9ad8\u9636\u6216\u96c6\u4f53\u7279\u5f81\u533a\u5206\u7684\u66f4\u4e00\u822c\u5206\u5e03\u3002\u9700\u8981\u5efa\u7acb\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u4efb\u610f\u76ee\u6807\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u7269\u79cd\u5f62\u6210\u7406\u8bba\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u5206\u7c7b\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u7c7b\u522b\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u7528\u7c7b\u522b\u95f4\u7684\u81ea\u7531\u80fd\u5dee\u8868\u5f81\u7269\u79cd\u5f62\u6210\u65f6\u95f4\u3002\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u53ef\u5904\u7406\u591a\u7c7b\u522b\u548c\u8fde\u7eed\u7ec6\u5316\u5206\u7c7b\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u53ef\u89e3\u6790\u5904\u7406\u7684\u793a\u4f8b\uff08\u4e0d\u540c\u6e29\u5ea6\u7684Ising\u6a21\u578b\u6df7\u5408\u548c\u96f6\u5747\u503c\u4e0d\u540c\u534f\u65b9\u5dee\u7684\u9ad8\u65af\u6df7\u5408\uff09\u4e2d\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7406\u8bba\u3002", "result": "\u7406\u8bba\u6062\u590d\u4e86\u9ad8\u65af\u6df7\u5408\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5df2\u77e5\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u7c7b\u522b\u65e0\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u4e00\u9636\u77e9\u533a\u5206\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u3002\u5728Ising\u6a21\u578b\u793a\u4f8b\u4e2d\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6620\u5c04\u5230\u968f\u673a\u573aIsing\u6a21\u578b\u5e76\u4f7f\u7528\u590d\u672c\u65b9\u6cd5\u83b7\u5f97\u7269\u79cd\u5f62\u6210\u65f6\u95f4\u7684\u663e\u5f0f\u8868\u8fbe\u5f0f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u5de5\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6269\u6563\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u7269\u79cd\u5f62\u6210\u8f6c\u53d8\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7edf\u4e00\u4e14\u5e7f\u6cdb\u9002\u7528\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u63cf\u8ff0\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5904\u7406\u4efb\u610f\u5177\u6709\u660e\u786e\u5b9a\u4e49\u7c7b\u522b\u7684\u76ee\u6807\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u901a\u8fc7\u9ad8\u9636\u6216\u96c6\u4f53\u7279\u5f81\u533a\u5206\u7684\u7c7b\u522b\u3002"}}

In addition, we characterize the conditions under which this trade-off becomes strict, providing a guide for trade-off selection in practice. Based on the theoretical characterization, we develop an empirical regularizer based on conditional mutual information (CMI) between predictions and sensitive attributes given the true outcome. The CMI regularizer is compatible with any deep model trained via gradient-based optimization and serves as a scalar monitor of residual separation violations, offering tractable guarantees during training. Finally, numerical experiments support our theoretical findings: across COMPAS, UCI Adult, UCI Bank, and CelebA, the proposed method substantially reduces separation violations while matching or exceeding the utility of established baseline methods.

In this work, we propose two simple techniques to improve policy gradient algorithms for LLMs. First, we replace the fixed anchor policy during RL with an Exponential Moving Average (EMA), similar to a target network in deep Q-learning. Second, we introduce Top-k KL estimator, which allows for flexible interpolation between exact KL and sampled KL. We derive the stability conditions for using EMA anchor; moreover, we show that our Top-k KL estimator yields both unbiased KL values and unbiased gradients at any k, while bringing the benefits of exact KL. When combined with GRPO, the two techniques (EMA-PG) lead to a significant performance boost. On math reasoning, it allows R1-distilled Qwen-1.5B to reach 53.9% on OlympiadBench compared to 50.8% by GRPO. On agentic RL domains, with Qwen-3B base, EMA-PG improves GRPO by an average of 33.3% across 7 datasets of Q&A with search engines, including 29.7% $\\rightarrow$ 44.1% on HotpotQA, 27.4% $\\rightarrow$ 40.1% on 2WikiMultiHopQA.

In this work, we study the automated design of agentic systems that remain safe even when a subset of agents is compromised. We formalize this challenge as a Stackelberg security game between a system designer (the Meta-Agent) and a best-responding Meta-Adversary that selects and compromises a subset of agents to minimize safety. We propose Meta-Adversary-Meta-Agent (MaMa), a novel algorithm for approximately solving this game and automatically designing safe agentic systems. Our approach uses LLM-based adversarial search, where the Meta-Agent iteratively proposes system designs and receives feedback based on the strongest attacks discovered by the Meta-Adversary. Empirical evaluations across diverse environments show that systems designed with MaMa consistently defend against worst-case attacks while maintaining performance comparable to systems optimized solely for task success.

However, conventional deep learning-based methods still suffer from high computational costs. To address this issue, we propose an Echo State Network (ESN) approach for radar-based HGR, using frequency-modulated-continuous-wave (FMCW) radar signals. Raw radar data is first converted into feature maps, such as range-time and Doppler-time maps, which are then fed into one or more recurrent neural network-based reservoirs. The obtained reservoir states are processed by readout classifiers, including ridge regression, support vector machines, and random forests. Comparative experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches on an 11-class HGR task using the Soli dataset and surpasses existing deep learning models on a 4-class HGR task using the Dop-NET dataset. The results indicate that parallel processing using multi-reservoir ESNs are effective for recognizing temporal patterns from the multiple different feature maps in the time-space and time-frequency domains. Our ESN approaches achieve high recognition performance with low computational cost in HGR, showing great potential for more advanced HCI technologies, especially in resource-constrained environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u56de\u58f0\u72b6\u6001\u7f51\u7edc\uff08ESN\uff09\u7684\u96f7\u8fbe\u624b\u52bf\u8bc6\u522b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528FMCW\u96f7\u8fbe\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u7279\u5f81\u56fe\u5e76\u884c\u5904\u7406\u548c\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u8bc6\u522b\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u3002", "motivation": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u591a\u666e\u52d2\u96f7\u8fbe\u7684\u624b\u52bf\u8bc6\u522b\u5728\u8f66\u8f7d\u754c\u9762\u548c\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u5e94\u7528\u5e7f\u6cdb\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\uff0c\u4e0d\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u73af\u5883\u3002\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u3001\u8ba1\u7b97\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u8bc6\u522b\u6280\u672f\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u539f\u59cb\u96f7\u8fbe\u6570\u636e\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u8ddd\u79bb-\u65f6\u95f4\u548c\u591a\u666e\u52d2-\u65f6\u95f4\u7279\u5f81\u56fe\uff0c\u8f93\u5165\u5230\u4e00\u4e2a\u6216\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u5faa\u73af\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u50a8\u5907\u6c60\u4e2d\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u4f7f\u7528\u5cad\u56de\u5f52\u3001\u652f\u6301\u5411\u91cf\u673a\u6216\u968f\u673a\u68ee\u6797\u7b49\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u5904\u7406\u50a8\u5907\u6c60\u72b6\u6001\u3002", "result": "\u5728Soli\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u768411\u7c7b\u624b\u52bf\u8bc6\u522b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728Dop-NET\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u76844\u7c7b\u624b\u52bf\u8bc6\u522b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8d85\u8d8a\u73b0\u6709\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u591a\u50a8\u5907\u6c60ESN\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u8bc6\u522b\u65f6\u7a7a\u548c\u65f6\u9891\u57df\u4e2d\u7684\u65f6\u5e8f\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u8bc6\u522b\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u5728\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u5de8\u5927\u5e94\u7528\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

In our preliminary experiments, we observe that naively applying full-parameter safety fine-tuning to MoE models can reduce attack success rates through routing or expert dominance effects, rather than by directly repairing Safety-Critical Experts. To address this challenge, we propose RASA, a routing-aware expert-level alignment framework that explicitly repairs Safety-Critical Experts while preventing routing-based bypasses. RASA identifies experts disproportionately activated by successful jailbreaks, selectively fine-tunes only these experts under fixed routing, and subsequently enforces routing consistency with safety-aligned contexts. Across two representative MoE architectures and a diverse set of jailbreak attacks, RASA achieves near-perfect robustness, strong cross-attack generalization, and substantially reduced over-refusal, while preserving general capabilities on benchmarks such as MMLU, GSM8K, and TruthfulQA.

We propose Greedy-Gradient norm (Greedy-Gnorm), a novel head pruning algorithm that dynamically recalculates head importance after each pruning step. Specifically, each head is scored by the elementwise product of the l2-norms of its Q/K/V gradient blocks, as estimated from a hold-out validation set and updated at every greedy iteration. This dynamic approach to scoring mitigates against stale rankings and better reflects gradient-informed importance as pruning progresses. Extensive experiments on BERT, ALBERT, RoBERTa, and XLM-RoBERTa demonstrate that Greedy-Gnorm consistently preserves accuracy under substantial head removal, outperforming attention entropy.

Federated Learning (FL) is an important paradigm for the Web because it enables privacy-preserving, collaborative machine learning across diverse user devices, web services and clients without needing to centralize sensitive data. However, its performance degrades severely under non-IID client distributions that is prevalent in real-world web systems. In this work, we propose a new training paradigm - Iterative Federated Adaptation (IFA) - that enhances generalization in heterogeneous federated settings through generation-wise forget and evolve strategy. Specifically, we divide training into multiple generations and, at the end of each, select a fraction of model parameters (a) randomly or (b) from the later layers of the model and reinitialize them. This iterative forget and evolve schedule allows the model to escape local minima and preserve globally relevant representations. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10, MIT-Indoors, and Stanford Dogs datasets show that the proposed approach improves global accuracy, especially when the data cross clients are Non-IID. This method can be implemented on top any federated algorithm to improve its generalization performance. We observe an average of 21.5%improvement across datasets.

In this work, we reformulate continual learning as a control problem where learning and preservation signals compete within neural activity dynamics. We convert regularization penalties into preservation signals that protect prior-task representations. Learning then proceeds by minimizing the control effort required to integrate new tasks while competing with the preservation of prior tasks. At equilibrium, the neural activities produce weight updates that implicitly encode the full prior-task curvature, a property we term the continual-natural gradient, requiring no explicit curvature storage.

Our key innovation is a formal power series expansion of the loss evolution, with coefficients encoded by diagrams akin to Feynman diagrams. We show that this expansion has a well-defined large-size limit that can be used to reveal different learning phases and, in some cases, to obtain explicit solutions of the nonlinear GF. We focus on learning Canonical Polyadic (CP) decompositions of high-order tensors, and show that this model has several distinct extreme lazy and rich GF regimes such as free evolution, NTK and under- and over-parameterized mean-field. We show that these regimes depend on the parameter scaling, tensor order, and symmetry of the model in a specific and subtle way. Moreover, we propose a general approach to summing the formal loss expansion by reducing it to a PDE; in a wide range of scenarios, it turns out to be 1st order and solvable by the method of characteristics.

Most methods address this by summing competing loss terms, creating gradient conflicts that are managed with complex and often inefficient strategies such as external memory replay or parameter regularization. We propose a reformulation of the continual learning objective using Douglas-Rachford Splitting (DRS). This reframes the learning process not as a direct trade-off, but as a negotiation between two decoupled objectives: one promoting plasticity for new tasks and the other enforcing stability of old knowledge. By iteratively finding a consensus through their proximal operators, DRS provides a more principled and stable learning dynamic. Our approach achieves an efficient balance between stability and plasticity without the need for auxiliary modules or complex add-ons, providing a simpler yet more powerful paradigm for continual learning systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4f7f\u7528Douglas-Rachford Splitting\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c06\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u91cd\u6784\u4e3a\u53ef\u5851\u6027\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u4e24\u4e2a\u89e3\u8026\u76ee\u6807\u7684\u534f\u5546\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u68af\u5ea6\u51b2\u7a81\u548c\u590d\u6742\u7b56\u7565", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u901a\u8fc7\u6c42\u548c\u7ade\u4e89\u635f\u5931\u9879\u6765\u5904\u7406\u53ef\u5851\u6027\u4e0e\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6743\u8861\uff0c\u8fd9\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u68af\u5ea6\u51b2\u7a81\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u590d\u6742\u4f4e\u6548\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u5982\u5916\u90e8\u8bb0\u5fc6\u56de\u653e\u6216\u53c2\u6570\u6b63\u5219\u5316", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4f7f\u7528Douglas-Rachford Splitting\u65b9\u6cd5\u91cd\u6784\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u5c06\u5b66\u4e60\u8fc7\u7a0b\u89c6\u4e3a\u53ef\u5851\u6027\uff08\u65b0\u4efb\u52a1\uff09\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff08\u65e7\u77e5\u8bc6\uff09\u4e24\u4e2a\u89e3\u8026\u76ee\u6807\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u534f\u5546\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8fd1\u7aef\u7b97\u5b50\u8fed\u4ee3\u5bfb\u627e\u5171\u8bc6", "result": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u53ef\u5851\u6027\u4e0e\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u4e4b\u95f4\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u5e73\u8861\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u8f85\u52a9\u6a21\u5757\u6216\u590d\u6742\u9644\u52a0\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff0c\u4e3a\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u7b80\u5355\u4f46\u66f4\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u8303\u5f0f", "conclusion": "DRS\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u539f\u5219\u6027\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u52a8\u6001\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u89e3\u8026\u76ee\u6807\u548c\u534f\u5546\u673a\u5236\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u68af\u5ea6\u51b2\u7a81\u95ee\u9898"}}

Annotations themselves are subject to aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty, which is typically ignored during annotation and evaluation. While crowdsourcing enables collecting multiple annotations per image to estimate these uncertainties, this approach is impractical at scale due to the required annotation effort. We introduce a probabilistic label spreading method that provides reliable estimates of aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty of labels. Assuming label smoothness over the feature space, we propagate single annotations using a graph-based diffusion method. We prove that label spreading yields consistent probability estimators even when the number of annotations per data point converges to zero. We present and analyze a scalable implementation of our method.

Training on unrolled trajectories is known to limit these divergences but quickly becomes too expensive due to the need for computing gradients over an iterative process. In this paper, we demonstrate that regularizing the Jacobian of the NDE model via its directional derivatives during training stabilizes long-term integration in the challenging context of short training rollouts. We design two regularizations, one for the case of known dynamics where we can directly derive the directional derivatives of the dynamic and one for the case of unknown dynamics where they are approximated using finite differences. Both methods, while having a far lower cost compared to long rollouts during training, are successful in improving the stability of long-term simulations for several ordinary and partial differential equations, opening up the door to training NDE methods for long-term integration of large scale systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e24\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u96c5\u53ef\u6bd4\u65b9\u5411\u5bfc\u6570\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u7a33\u5b9a\u795e\u7ecf\u5fae\u5206\u65b9\u7a0b\u7684\u957f\u671f\u79ef\u5206\uff0c\u964d\u4f4e\u8bad\u7ec3\u6210\u672c", "motivation": "\u6df7\u5408\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u795e\u7ecf\u5fae\u5206\u65b9\u7a0b\u5728\u7269\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\u5efa\u6a21\u4e2d\u8d8a\u6765\u8d8a\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u957f\u671f\u79ef\u5206\u65f6\u5b58\u5728\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u7cbe\u5ea6\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u4f20\u7edf\u57fa\u4e8e\u5c55\u5f00\u8f68\u8ff9\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\u867d\u7136\u80fd\u9650\u5236\u53d1\u6563\uff0c\u4f46\u8ba1\u7b97\u68af\u5ea6\u6210\u672c\u8fc7\u9ad8", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u4e24\u79cd\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a1\uff09\u5df2\u77e5\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u65f6\u76f4\u63a5\u63a8\u5bfc\u52a8\u6001\u7684\u65b9\u5411\u5bfc\u6570\uff1b2\uff09\u672a\u77e5\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u65f6\u4f7f\u7528\u6709\u9650\u5dee\u5206\u8fd1\u4f3c\u65b9\u5411\u5bfc\u6570\u3002\u4e24\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u90fd\u901a\u8fc7\u6b63\u5219\u5316NDE\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u96c5\u53ef\u6bd4\u77e9\u9635\u6765\u7a33\u5b9a\u957f\u671f\u79ef\u5206", "result": "\u4e24\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u6210\u672c\u8fdc\u4f4e\u4e8e\u957f\u8f68\u8ff9\u5c55\u5f00\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u591a\u4e2a\u5e38\u5fae\u5206\u65b9\u7a0b\u548c\u504f\u5fae\u5206\u65b9\u7a0b\u957f\u671f\u6a21\u62df\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u8bad\u7ec3\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u7cfb\u7edf\u957f\u671f\u79ef\u5206\u7684NDE\u65b9\u6cd5\u6253\u5f00\u4e86\u5927\u95e8\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u6539\u5584\u4e86\u957f\u671f\u6a21\u62df\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027"}}

If forecasts are inaccurate during those periods, power systems are more likely to face supply shortfalls or localized overloads, forcing emergency actions such as load shedding and increasing the risk of service disruptions and public-safety impacts. This problem is inherently difficult because extreme events can trigger abrupt regime shifts in load patterns, while relevant extreme samples are rare and irregular, making reliable learning and calibration challenging. We propose AdaCNP, a probabilistic forecasting model for data-scarce condition. AdaCNP learns similarity in a shared embedding space. For each target data, it evaluates how relevant each historical context segment is to the current condition and reweights the context information accordingly. This design highlights the most informative historical evidence even when extreme samples are rare. It enables few-shot adaptation to previously unseen extreme patterns. AdaCNP also produces predictive distributions for risk-aware decision-making without expensive fine-tuning on the target domain. We evaluate AdaCNP on real-world power-system load data and compare it against a range of representative baselines. The results show that AdaCNP is more robust during extreme periods, reducing the mean squared error by 22\\% relative to the strongest baseline while achieving the lowest negative log-likelihood, indicating more reliable probabilistic outputs. These findings suggest that AdaCNP can effectively mitigate the combined impact of abrupt distribution shifts and scarce extreme samples, providing a more trustworthy forecasting for resilient power system operation under extreme events.", "AI": {"tldr": "AdaCNP\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u7528\u4e8e\u6781\u7aef\u5929\u6c14\u4e0b\u7535\u529b\u8d1f\u8377\u6982\u7387\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5171\u4eab\u5d4c\u5165\u7a7a\u95f4\u5b66\u4e60\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\uff0c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u91cd\u52a0\u6743\u5386\u53f2\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u9002\u5e94\u548c\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u6982\u7387\u8f93\u51fa\u3002", "motivation": "\u6781\u7aef\u5929\u6c14\u4f1a\u663e\u8457\u6539\u53d8\u7535\u529b\u6d88\u8d39\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u8d1f\u8377\u66f2\u7ebf\u51fa\u73b0\u5c16\u5cf0\u548c\u5267\u70c8\u6ce2\u52a8\u3002\u4e0d\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u7535\u529b\u7cfb\u7edf\u4f9b\u5e94\u77ed\u7f3a\u6216\u5c40\u90e8\u8fc7\u8f7d\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u7d27\u6025\u63aa\u65bd\u5982\u51cf\u8f7d\uff0c\u589e\u52a0\u670d\u52a1\u4e2d\u65ad\u548c\u516c\u5171\u5b89\u5168\u98ce\u9669\u3002\u95ee\u9898\u96be\u70b9\u5728\u4e8e\u6781\u7aef\u4e8b\u4ef6\u4f1a\u89e6\u53d1\u8d1f\u8377\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684\u7a81\u7136\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u800c\u76f8\u5173\u6781\u7aef\u6837\u672c\u7a00\u5c11\u4e14\u4e0d\u89c4\u5219\uff0c\u4f7f\u5f97\u53ef\u9760\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u6821\u51c6\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\u3002", "method": "AdaCNP\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u7528\u4e8e\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u6982\u7387\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u5b83\u5728\u5171\u4eab\u5d4c\u5165\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e60\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\uff0c\u5bf9\u6bcf\u4e2a\u76ee\u6807\u6570\u636e\u8bc4\u4f30\u5386\u53f2\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u6bb5\u4e0e\u5f53\u524d\u6761\u4ef6\u7684\u76f8\u5173\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u76f8\u5e94\u5730\u5bf9\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4fe1\u606f\u8fdb\u884c\u91cd\u52a0\u6743\u3002\u8fd9\u79cd\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5373\u4f7f\u5728\u6781\u7aef\u6837\u672c\u7a00\u5c11\u65f6\u4e5f\u80fd\u7a81\u51fa\u6700\u6709\u4fe1\u606f\u91cf\u7684\u5386\u53f2\u8bc1\u636e\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9\u65b0\u6781\u7aef\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u9002\u5e94\uff0c\u5e76\u4ea7\u751f\u7528\u4e8e\u98ce\u9669\u611f\u77e5\u51b3\u7b56\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u5728\u76ee\u6807\u57df\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u6602\u8d35\u7684\u5fae\u8c03\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u7535\u529b\u7cfb\u7edf\u8d1f\u8377\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u663e\u793a\uff0cAdaCNP\u5728\u6781\u7aef\u65f6\u671f\u66f4\u52a0\u7a33\u5065\uff0c\u76f8\u5bf9\u4e8e\u6700\u5f3a\u57fa\u7ebf\u51cf\u5c11\u4e8622%\u7684\u5747\u65b9\u8bef\u5dee\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6700\u4f4e\u7684\u8d1f\u5bf9\u6570\u4f3c\u7136\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u5176\u6982\u7387\u8f93\u51fa\u66f4\u52a0\u53ef\u9760\u3002", "conclusion": "AdaCNP\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u7a81\u7136\u5206\u5e03\u53d8\u5316\u548c\u6781\u7aef\u6837\u672c\u7a00\u7f3a\u7684\u7efc\u5408\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u4e3a\u6781\u7aef\u4e8b\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u5f39\u6027\u7535\u529b\u7cfb\u7edf\u8fd0\u884c\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u53ef\u4fe1\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u3002"}}

Includes appendix. Preprint under review", "summary": "Protein inverse folding, the task of predicting amino acid sequences for desired structures, is pivotal for de novo protein design. However, existing GNN-based methods typically suffer from restricted receptive fields that miss long-range dependencies and a \"single-pass\" inference paradigm that leads to error accumulation. To address these bottlenecks, we propose RIGA-Fold, a framework that synergizes Recurrent Interaction with Geometric Awareness. At the micro-level, we introduce a Geometric Attention Update (GAU) module where edge features explicitly serve as attention keys, ensuring strictly SE(3)-invariant local encoding. At the macro-level, we design an attention-based Global Context Bridge that acts as a soft gating mechanism to dynamically inject global topological information. Furthermore, to bridge the gap between structural and sequence modalities, we introduce an enhanced variant, RIGA-Fold*, which integrates trainable geometric features with frozen evolutionary priors from ESM-2 and ESM-IF via a dual-stream architecture. Finally, a biologically inspired ``predict-recycle-refine'' strategy is implemented to iteratively denoise sequence distributions.

To address these limitations, we propose MTS-JEPA, a specialized architecture that integrates a multi-resolution predictive objective with a soft codebook bottleneck. This design explicitly decouples transient shocks from long-term trends, and utilizes the codebook to capture discrete regime transitions.

PPO performs well empirically but has a heuristic motivation and handles the KL-divergence constraint used in LM-RLHF in an ad-hoc manner and suffers form reward oscillations, entropy collapse, value function drift, and sudden policy divergence that require frequent restarts and extensive hyperparameter tuning. In this paper, we develop a new pure on policy actor-critic RL method for the LM-RLHF setting. We present SAFE (Stable Alignment Finetuning with Entropy-aware control),a novel RLHF algorithm that combines a Double Soft-Min Critic for pessimistic value estimation with a new multi-layer stabilization framework combining entropy-gated KL regulation, and PID-controlled adaptive thresholds. Unlike standard PPO's symmetric KL penalties, SAFE distinguishes high-entropy exploration from low-entropy mode collapse and adjusts penalties dynamically based on reward velocity. Experiments on a 3B parameter model show SAFE achieves +5.15\\% training-average reward than PPO (0.725 vs 0.689), negligible reward crashes, and superior KL control than ppo . Our method adds minimal computational overhead and provides an interpretable, crash-resistant RLHF framework that maintains aggressive learning speed while ensuring stable long-horizon optimization suitable for production deployment.

However, these tasks remain challenging because diffusion models have intractable likelihoods, which creates a barrier for directly applying popular policy-gradient type methods. Existing approaches primarily focus on crafting new objectives built on already heavily engineered LLM objectives, using ad hoc estimators for likelihood, without a thorough investigation into how such estimation affects overall algorithmic performance. In this work, we provide a systematic analysis of the RL design space by disentangling three factors: i) policy-gradient objectives, ii) likelihood estimators, and iii) rollout sampling schemes. We show that adopting an evidence lower bound (ELBO) based model likelihood estimator, computed only from the final generated sample, is the dominant factor enabling effective, efficient, and stable RL optimization, outweighing the impact of the specific policy-gradient loss functional.

In this work, we aim to address these questions through a unified spectral perspective. Specifically, we view Muon as the p = 0 endpoint of a family of spectral transformations of the form U \\boldsymbol\u03a3^{p} V' , and consider additional variants with p = 1/2 , p = 1/4 , and p = 1 . These transformations are applied to both first-moment updates, as in momentum SGD, and to root-mean-square (RMS) normalized gradient updates as in Adam. To enable efficient computation, we develop a coupled Newton iteration that avoids explicit singular value decomposition. Across controlled experiments, we find that RMS-normalized updates yield more stable optimization than first-moment updates. Moreover, while spectral compression provides strong stabilization benefits under first-moment updates, the Muon update (p = 0) does not consistently outperform Adam. These results suggest that Muon is best understood as an effective form of spectral normalization, but not a universally superior optimization method.

To address these issues, we introduce Generalized Schr\u00f6dinger Bridge on Graphs (GSBoG), a novel scalable data-driven framework for learning executable controlled continuous-time Markov chain (CTMC) policies on arbitrary graphs under state cost augmented dynamics. Notably, GSBoG learns trajectory-level policies, avoiding dense global solvers and thereby enhancing scalability. This is achieved via a likelihood optimization approach, satisfying the endpoint marginals, while simultaneously optimizing intermediate behavior under state-dependent running costs. Extensive experimentation on challenging real-world graph topologies shows that GSBoG reliably learns accurate, topology-respecting policies while optimizing application-specific intermediate state costs, highlighting its broad applicability and paving new avenues for cost-aware dynamical transport on general graphs.", "AI": {"tldr": "GSBoG\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5728\u4efb\u610f\u56fe\u4e0a\u5b66\u4e60\u53ef\u6267\u884c\u7684\u8fde\u7eed\u65f6\u95f4\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u94fe\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4f3c\u7136\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b66\u4e60\u8f68\u8ff9\u7ea7\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u5168\u5c40\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u56fe\u4f20\u8f93\u65b9\u6cd5\u7f3a\u4e4f\u53ef\u6267\u884c\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4f9d\u8d56\u9650\u5236\u6027\u5047\u8bbe\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u5728\u7a00\u758f\u62d3\u6251\u4e0a\u6cdb\u5316\uff0c\u4e14\u968f\u7740\u56fe\u5927\u5c0f\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u8303\u56f4\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u5dee\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u591f\u5b66\u4e60\u53ef\u6267\u884c\u7b56\u7565\u3001\u5c0a\u91cd\u62d3\u6251\u7ea6\u675f\u5e76\u4f18\u5316\u5e94\u7528\u7279\u5b9a\u6210\u672c\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5e7f\u4e49\u859b\u5b9a\u8c14\u6865\u5728\u56fe\u4e0a\u7684\u6846\u67b6(GSBoG)\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4f3c\u7136\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b66\u4e60\u8f68\u8ff9\u7ea7\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u6ee1\u8db3\u7aef\u70b9\u8fb9\u9645\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4f18\u5316\u72b6\u6001\u76f8\u5173\u8fd0\u884c\u6210\u672c\u4e0b\u7684\u4e2d\u95f4\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u4f7f\u7528\u5bc6\u96c6\u7684\u5168\u5c40\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u56fe\u62d3\u6251\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0cGSBoG\u80fd\u591f\u53ef\u9760\u5730\u5b66\u4e60\u51c6\u786e\u3001\u5c0a\u91cd\u62d3\u6251\u7684\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4f18\u5316\u5e94\u7528\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u4e2d\u95f4\u72b6\u6001\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5176\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u9002\u7528\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "GSBoG\u4e3a\u4e00\u822c\u56fe\u4e0a\u7684\u6210\u672c\u611f\u77e5\u52a8\u6001\u4f20\u8f93\u5f00\u8f9f\u4e86\u65b0\u9014\u5f84\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5b66\u4e60\u53ef\u6267\u884c\u7b56\u7565\u5e76\u4f18\u5316\u5e94\u7528\u7279\u5b9a\u6210\u672c\u3002"}}

However, conventional KD formulations - typically based on Kullback-Leibler divergence - assume that the teacher provides reliable soft targets. In practice, teacher predictions are often noisy or overconfident, and existing correction-based approaches rely on ad-hoc heuristics and extensive hyper-parameter tuning, which hinders generalization. We introduce REDistill (Robust Estimator Distillation), a simple yet principled framework grounded in robust statistics. REDistill replaces the standard KD objective with a power divergence loss, a generalization of KL divergence that adaptively downweights unreliable teacher output while preserving informative logit relationships. This formulation provides a unified and interpretable treatment of teacher noise, requires only logits, integrates seamlessly into existing KD pipelines, and incurs negligible computational overhead. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-100 and ImageNet-1k demonstrate that REDistill consistently improves student accuracy in diverse teacher-student architectures.

Despite their ecological and climatic significance, accurately simulating phytoplankton dynamics remains a major challenge for biogeochemical numerical models due to limited parameterizations, sparse observational data, and the complexity of oceanic processes. Here, we explore how deep learning models can be used to address these limitations predicting the spatio-temporal distribution of phytoplankton biomass in the global ocean based on satellite observations and environmental conditions. First, we investigate several deep learning architectures. Among the tested models, the UNet architecture stands out for its ability to reproduce the seasonal and interannual patterns of phytoplankton biomass more accurately than other models like CNNs, ConvLSTM, and 4CastNet. When using one to two months of environmental data as input, UNet performs better, although it tends to underestimate the amplitude of low-frequency changes in phytoplankton biomass. Thus, to improve predictions over time, an auto-regressive version of UNet was also tested, where the model uses its own previous predictions to forecast future conditions. This approach works well for short-term forecasts (up to five months), though its performance decreases for longer time scales. Overall, our study shows that combining ocean physical predictors with deep learning allows for reconstruction and short-term prediction of phytoplankton dynamics. These models could become powerful tools for monitoring ocean health and supporting marine ecosystem management, especially in the context of climate change.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u7d22\u4f7f\u7528\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u6d4b\u5168\u7403\u6d77\u6d0b\u6d6e\u6e38\u690d\u7269\u751f\u7269\u91cf\u7684\u65f6\u7a7a\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0UNet\u67b6\u6784\u5728\u91cd\u73b0\u5b63\u8282\u548c\u5e74\u9645\u6a21\u5f0f\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\uff0c\u81ea\u56de\u5f52UNet\u53ef\u7528\u4e8e\u77ed\u671f\u9884\u6d4b\uff08\u6700\u591a5\u4e2a\u6708\uff09\u3002", "motivation": "\u6d6e\u6e38\u690d\u7269\u662f\u6d77\u6d0b\u98df\u7269\u7f51\u7684\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u5bf9\u751f\u6001\u8fc7\u7a0b\u548c\u5168\u7403\u751f\u7269\u5730\u7403\u5316\u5b66\u5faa\u73af\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u7531\u4e8e\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u6709\u9650\u3001\u89c2\u6d4b\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u758f\u4ee5\u53ca\u6d77\u6d0b\u8fc7\u7a0b\u590d\u6742\uff0c\u51c6\u786e\u6a21\u62df\u6d6e\u6e38\u690d\u7269\u52a8\u6001\u4ecd\u7136\u662f\u751f\u7269\u5730\u7403\u5316\u5b66\u6570\u503c\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u7d22\u4e86\u591a\u79cd\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u5305\u62ecCNN\u3001ConvLSTM\u30014CastNet\u548cUNet\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u536b\u661f\u89c2\u6d4b\u548c\u73af\u5883\u6761\u4ef6\u6570\u636e\u9884\u6d4b\u6d6e\u6e38\u690d\u7269\u751f\u7269\u91cf\u3002\u7279\u522b\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e86\u4f7f\u75281-2\u4e2a\u6708\u73af\u5883\u6570\u636e\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8f93\u5165\u7684UNet\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u7248\u672c\u7684UNet\uff08\u5229\u7528\u81ea\u8eab\u5148\u524d\u9884\u6d4b\u6765\u9884\u6d4b\u672a\u6765\u6761\u4ef6\uff09\u3002", "result": "UNet\u67b6\u6784\u5728\u91cd\u73b0\u6d6e\u6e38\u690d\u7269\u751f\u7269\u91cf\u7684\u5b63\u8282\u548c\u5e74\u9645\u6a21\u5f0f\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u5176\u4ed6\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u4f7f\u75281-2\u4e2a\u6708\u8f93\u5165\u6570\u636e\u65f6\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u597d\uff0c\u4f46\u503e\u5411\u4e8e\u4f4e\u4f30\u4f4e\u9891\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u5e45\u5ea6\u3002\u81ea\u56de\u5f52UNet\u5728\u77ed\u671f\u9884\u6d4b\uff08\u6700\u591a5\u4e2a\u6708\uff09\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u4f46\u957f\u671f\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7ed3\u5408\u6d77\u6d0b\u7269\u7406\u9884\u6d4b\u56e0\u5b50\u4e0e\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u53ef\u4ee5\u91cd\u5efa\u548c\u77ed\u671f\u9884\u6d4b\u6d6e\u6e38\u690d\u7269\u52a8\u6001\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u80fd\u6210\u4e3a\u76d1\u6d4b\u6d77\u6d0b\u5065\u5eb7\u548c\u652f\u6301\u6d77\u6d0b\u751f\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u7ba1\u7406\u7684\u5f3a\u5927\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u6c14\u5019\u53d8\u5316\u80cc\u666f\u4e0b\u3002"}}

Although various limitations have been identified, their theoretical foundations remain poorly understood, leading to fragmented research efforts. In this thesis, we provide an in-depth theoretical analysis and identify several key properties limiting the performance of MPNNs. Building on these findings, we propose several frameworks that address these shortcomings. We identify two properties exhibited by many MPNNs: shared component amplification (SCA), where each message-passing iteration amplifies the same components across all feature channels, and component dominance (CD), where a single component gets increasingly amplified as more message-passing steps are applied. These properties lead to the observable phenomenon of rank collapse of node representations, which generalizes the established over-smoothing phenomenon. By generalizing and decomposing over-smoothing, we enable a deeper understanding of MPNNs, more targeted solutions, and more precise communication within the field. To avoid SCA, we show that utilizing multiple computational graphs or edge relations is necessary. Our multi-relational split (MRS) framework transforms any existing MPNN into one that leverages multiple edge relations. Additionally, we introduce the spectral graph convolution for multiple feature channels (MIMO-GC), which naturally uses multiple computational graphs. A localized variant, LMGC, approximates the MIMO-GC while inheriting its beneficial properties. To address CD, we demonstrate a close connection between MPNNs and the PageRank algorithm. Based on personalized PageRank, we propose a variant of MPNNs that allows for infinitely many message-passing iterations, while preserving initial node features.

This task arises in many application domains, such as healthcare and finance, where mispredictions can have a high cost and reduce trust. The learning with abstention framework tackles these problems by allowing a model to abstain from offering a prediction when it is at an elevated risk of making a misprediction. Unfortunately, existing abstention strategies are ill-suited for the multi-horizon setting: they target problems where a model offers a single prediction for each instance. Hence, they ignore the structured and correlated nature of the predictions offered by a multi-horizon forecaster. We formalize the problem of learning with abstention for multi-horizon forecasting setting and show that its structured nature admits a richer set of abstention problems. Concretely, we propose three natural notions of how a model could abstain for multi-horizon forecasting. We theoretically analyze each problem to derive the optimal abstention strategy and propose an algorithm that implements it.

Further, we find that the distance between embedded feature explanations increases with stricter orthogonality penalty, a desirable property for interpretability.

Despite rapid progress, existing PPG-based blood pressure estimation models have not consistently achieved the established clinical numerical limits such as AAMI/ISO 81060-2, and prior evaluations often lack the rigorous experimental controls necessary for valid clinical assessment. Moreover, the publicly available datasets commonly used are heterogeneous and lack physiologically controlled conditions for fair benchmarking. To enable fair benchmarking under physiologically controlled conditions, we created a standardized benchmarking subset NBPDB comprising 101,453 high-quality PPG segments from 1,103 healthy adults, derived from MIMIC-III and VitalDB. Using this dataset, we systematically benchmarked several state-of-the-art PPG-based models. The results showed that none of the evaluated models met the AAMI/ISO 81060-2 accuracy requirements (mean error $<$ 5 mmHg and standard deviation $<$ 8 mmHg). To improve model accuracy, we modified these models and added patient demographic data such as age, sex, and body mass index as additional inputs. Our modifications consistently improved performance across all models. In particular, the MInception model reduced error by 23\\% after adding the demographic data and yielded mean absolute errors of 4.75 mmHg (SBP) and 2.90 mmHg (DBP), achieves accuracy comparable to the numerical limits defined by AAMI/ISO accuracy standards.

However, most deep generative models focus exclusively on perfectly ordered crystals, neglecting the important class of disordered materials. To address this gap, we introduce DMFlow, a generative framework specifically designed for disordered crystals. Our approach introduces a unified representation for ordered, Substitutionally Disordered (SD), and Positionally Disordered (PD) crystals, and employs a flow matching model to jointly generate all structural components. A key innovation is a Riemannian flow matching framework with spherical reparameterization, which ensures physically valid disorder weights on the probability simplex. The vector field is learned by a novel Graph Neural Network (GNN) that incorporates physical symmetries and a specialized message-passing scheme. Finally, a two-stage discretization procedure converts the continuous weights into multi-hot atomic assignments. To support research in this area, we release a benchmark containing SD, PD, and mixed structures curated from the Crystallography Open Database. Experiments on Crystal Structure Prediction (CSP) and De Novo Generation (DNG) tasks demonstrate that DMFlow significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines adapted from ordered crystal generation.

We define an action in deployment to be perfectly rational if it maximises the hidden true value function in the steepest direction. The expected value discrepancy of a policy's actions against their rational counterparts, culminating over the trajectory in deployment, is defined to be expected rational risk; an empirical average version in training is also defined. Their difference, termed as rational risk gap, is decomposed into (1) an extrinsic component caused by environment shifts between training and deployment, and (2) an intrinsic one due to the algorithm's generalisability in a dynamic environment. They are upper bounded by, respectively, (1) the $1$-Wasserstein distance between transition kernels and initial state distributions in training and deployment, and (2) the empirical Rademacher complexity of the value function class. Our theory suggests hypotheses on the benefits from regularisers (including layer normalisation, $\\ell_2$ regularisation, and weight normalisation) and domain randomisation, as well as the harm from environment shifts.

Here we develop a dual-stage TransUNet-based multi-source precipitation merging framework (DDL-MSPMF) that integrates six MSPs with four ERA5 near-surface physical predictors. A first-stage classifier estimates daily precipitation occurrence probability, and a second-stage regressor fuses the classifier outputs together with all predictors to estimate daily precipitation amount at 0.25 degree resolution over China for 2001-2020. Benchmarking against multiple deep learning and hybrid baselines shows that the TransUNet - TransUNet configuration yields the best seasonal performance (R = 0.75; RMSE = 2.70 mm/day) and improves robustness relative to a single-regressor setting. For heavy precipitation (>25 mm/day), DDL-MSPMF increases equitable threat scores across most regions of eastern China and better reproduces the spatial pattern of the July 2021 Zhengzhou rainstorm, indicating enhanced extreme-event detection beyond seasonal-mean corrections. Independent evaluation over the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau using TPHiPr further supports its applicability in data-scarce regions.

In this work, we focus on gradient variation in Bandit Convex Optimization (BCO) with two-point feedback. By proposing a refined analysis on the non-consecutive gradient variation, a fundamental quantity in gradient variation with bandits, we improve the dimension dependence for both convex and strongly convex functions compared with the best known results (Chiang et al., 2013). Our improved analysis for the non-consecutive gradient variation also implies other favorable problem-dependent guarantees, such as gradient-variance and small-loss regrets. Beyond the two-point setup, we demonstrate the versatility of our technique by achieving the first gradient-variation bound for one-point bandit linear optimization over hyper-rectangular domains. Finally, we validate the effectiveness of our results in more challenging tasks such as dynamic/universal regret minimization and bandit games, establishing the first gradient-variation dynamic and universal regret bounds for two-point BCO and fast convergence rates in bandit games.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u6539\u8fdb\u4e86\u5e26\u68af\u5ea6\u53d8\u5316\u7684Bandit\u51f8\u4f18\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7cbe\u5316\u975e\u8fde\u7eed\u68af\u5ea6\u53d8\u5316\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u5728\u4e24\u70b9\u53cd\u9988\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u51f8\u548c\u5f3a\u51f8\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u7ef4\u5ea6\u4f9d\u8d56\uff0c\u5e76\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u5355\u70b9\u7ebf\u6027\u4f18\u5316\u3001\u52a8\u6001/\u901a\u7528\u9057\u61be\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u53ca\u535a\u5f08\u7b49\u4efb\u52a1\u3002", "motivation": "\u68af\u5ea6\u53d8\u5316\u5728\u7ebf\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u535a\u5f08\u8bba\u548c\u4f18\u5316\u4e2d\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u4f46\u5728bandit\u53cd\u9988\u4e0b\u7814\u7a76\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u4e24\u70b9\u53cd\u9988\u7684Bandit\u51f8\u4f18\u5316\u4e2d\u68af\u5ea6\u53d8\u5316\u5206\u6790\u4e0d\u591f\u7cbe\u7ec6\uff0c\u7ef4\u5ea6\u4f9d\u8d56\u6709\u5f85\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5bf9\u975e\u8fde\u7eed\u68af\u5ea6\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u7cbe\u5316\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u8fd9\u662fbandit\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u68af\u5ea6\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u6838\u5fc3\u91cf\u3002\u6539\u8fdb\u4e24\u70b9\u53cd\u9988Bandit\u51f8\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u5206\u6790\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5e76\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u5355\u70b9\u7ebf\u6027\u4f18\u5316\u3001\u52a8\u6001/\u901a\u7528\u9057\u61be\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u53cabandit\u535a\u5f08\u7b49\u573a\u666f\u3002", "result": "1. \u5728\u4e24\u70b9\u53cd\u9988Bandit\u51f8\u4f18\u5316\u4e2d\uff0c\u5bf9\u51f8\u548c\u5f3a\u51f8\u51fd\u6570\u6539\u8fdb\u4e86\u7ef4\u5ea6\u4f9d\u8d56\uff0c\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e86Chiang\u7b49\u4eba(2013)\u7684\u6700\u4f73\u7ed3\u679c\uff1b2. \u9996\u6b21\u4e3a\u5355\u70b9bandit\u7ebf\u6027\u4f18\u5316\u5728\u8d85\u77e9\u5f62\u57df\u4e0a\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u68af\u5ea6\u53d8\u5316\u754c\uff1b3. \u5728\u52a8\u6001/\u901a\u7528\u9057\u61be\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u548cbandit\u535a\u5f08\u4e2d\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u9996\u4e2a\u68af\u5ea6\u53d8\u5316\u52a8\u6001\u548c\u901a\u7528\u9057\u61be\u754c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7cbe\u5316\u975e\u8fde\u7eed\u68af\u5ea6\u53d8\u5316\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u663e\u8457\u63a8\u8fdb\u4e86bandit\u53cd\u9988\u4e0b\u7684\u68af\u5ea6\u53d8\u5316\u5728\u7ebf\u5b66\u4e60\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u4f18\u7684\u7ef4\u5ea6\u4f9d\u8d56\u548c\u66f4\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u4e3a\u76f8\u5173\u9886\u57df\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

Central to the recipe is the GraphBFF Transformer, a flexible and scalable architecture designed for practical billion-scale GFMs. Using the GraphBFF, we present the first neural scaling laws for general graphs and show that loss decreases predictably as either model capacity or training data scales, depending on which factor is the bottleneck. The GraphBFF framework provides concrete methodologies for data batching, pretraining, and fine-tuning for building GFMs at scale. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the framework with an evaluation of a 1.4 billion-parameter GraphBFF Transformer pretrained on one billion samples. Across ten diverse, real-world downstream tasks on graphs unseen during training, spanning node- and link-level classification and regression, GraphBFF achieves remarkable zero-shot and probing performance, including in few-shot settings, with large margins of up to 31 PRAUC points.

Recent efforts to encode EEG signals into large language models (LLMs) show promise in handling neural signals across diverse patients, but two significant challenges remain: (1) multi-channel heterogeneity, as seizure-relevant information varies substantially across EEG channels, and (2) computing inefficiency, as the EEG signals need to be encoded into a massive number of tokens for the prediction. To address these issues, we draw the EEG signal and propose the novel NeuroCanvas framework. Specifically, NeuroCanvas consists of two modules: (i) The Entropy-guided Channel Selector (ECS) selects the seizure-relevant channels input to LLM and (ii) the following Canvas of Neuron Signal (CNS) converts selected multi-channel heterogeneous EEG signals into structured visual representations. The ECS module alleviates the multi-channel heterogeneity issue, and the CNS uses compact visual tokens to represent the EEG signals that improve the computing efficiency. We evaluate NeuroCanvas across multiple seizure detection datasets, demonstrating a significant improvement of $20\\%$ in F1 score and reductions of $88\\%$ in inference latency. These results highlight NeuroCanvas as a scalable and effective solution for real-time and resource-efficient seizure detection in clinical practice.The code will be released at https://github.com/Yanchen30247/seizure_detect.", "AI": {"tldr": "NeuroCanvas\uff1a\u57fa\u4e8eLLM\u7684\u766b\u75eb\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u71b5\u5f15\u5bfc\u901a\u9053\u9009\u62e9\u5668\u548c\u795e\u7ecf\u4fe1\u53f7\u753b\u5e03\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3EEG\u591a\u901a\u9053\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0aF1\u5206\u6570\u63d0\u534720%\uff0c\u63a8\u7406\u5ef6\u8fdf\u964d\u4f4e88%\u3002", "motivation": "\u766b\u75eb\u68c0\u6d4b\u5bf9\u4e34\u5e8a\u5e72\u9884\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u4eba\u5de5\u5ba1\u67e5\u957f\u671fEEG\u8bb0\u5f55\u52b3\u52a8\u5bc6\u96c6\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u5c06EEG\u7f16\u7801\u5230LLM\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u9762\u4e34\u4e24\u5927\u6311\u6218\uff1a1\uff09\u591a\u901a\u9053\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\uff08\u766b\u75eb\u76f8\u5173\u4fe1\u606f\u5728\u4e0d\u540cEEG\u901a\u9053\u4e2d\u5dee\u5f02\u663e\u8457\uff09\uff1b2\uff09\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\uff08EEG\u4fe1\u53f7\u9700\u8981\u7f16\u7801\u4e3a\u5927\u91cftoken\u8fdb\u884c\u9884\u6d4b\uff09\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faNeuroCanvas\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u4e24\u4e2a\u6a21\u5757\uff1a1\uff09\u71b5\u5f15\u5bfc\u901a\u9053\u9009\u62e9\u5668\uff08ECS\uff09\uff1a\u9009\u62e9\u4e0e\u766b\u75eb\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u901a\u9053\u8f93\u5165LLM\uff1b2\uff09\u795e\u7ecf\u4fe1\u53f7\u753b\u5e03\uff08CNS\uff09\uff1a\u5c06\u9009\u5b9a\u7684\u591a\u901a\u9053\u5f02\u8d28EEG\u4fe1\u53f7\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u89c6\u89c9\u8868\u793a\u3002ECS\u7f13\u89e3\u591a\u901a\u9053\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0cCNS\u4f7f\u7528\u7d27\u51d1\u7684\u89c6\u89c9token\u8868\u793aEEG\u4fe1\u53f7\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u766b\u75eb\u68c0\u6d4b\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0cF1\u5206\u6570\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u534720%\uff0c\u63a8\u7406\u5ef6\u8fdf\u964d\u4f4e88%\u3002\u8bc1\u660eNeuroCanvas\u662f\u4e34\u5e8a\u5b9e\u8df5\u4e2d\u5b9e\u65f6\u4e14\u8d44\u6e90\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u766b\u75eb\u68c0\u6d4b\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "conclusion": "NeuroCanvas\u901a\u8fc7\u89e3\u51b3\u591a\u901a\u9053\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u57fa\u4e8eLLM\u7684\u766b\u75eb\u68c0\u6d4b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u4e14\u6709\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u4e34\u5e8a\u5b9e\u7528\u4ef7\u503c\u3002"}}

The pushforward behavior can be carried out iteratively at inference time, for example in diffusion and flow-based models. In this paper, we propose a new paradigm called Drifting Models, which evolve the pushforward distribution during training and naturally admit one-step inference. We introduce a drifting field that governs the sample movement and achieves equilibrium when the distributions match. This leads to a training objective that allows the neural network optimizer to evolve the distribution. In experiments, our one-step generator achieves state-of-the-art results on ImageNet at 256 x 256 resolution, with an FID of 1.54 in latent space and 1.61 in pixel space.

Engelhard"], "title": "Interval-Based AUC (iAUC): Extending ROC Analysis to Uncertainty-Aware Classification", "comment": null, "summary": "In high-stakes risk prediction, quantifying uncertainty through interval-valued predictions is essential for reliable decision-making. However, standard evaluation tools like the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and the area under the curve (AUC) are designed for point scores and fail to capture the impact of predictive uncertainty on ranking performance. We propose an uncertainty-aware ROC framework specifically for interval-valued predictions, introducing two new measures: $AUC_L$ and $AUC_U$. This framework enables an informative three-region decomposition of the ROC plane, partitioning pairwise rankings into correct, incorrect, and uncertain orderings. This approach naturally supports selective prediction by allowing models to abstain from ranking cases with overlapping intervals, thereby optimizing the trade-off between abstention rate and discriminative reliability. We prove that under valid class-conditional coverage, $AUC_L$ and $AUC_U$ provide formal lower and upper bounds on the theoretical optimal AUC ($AUC^*$), characterizing the physical limit of achievable discrimination. The proposed framework applies broadly to interval-valued prediction models, regardless of the interval construction method. Experiments on real-world benchmark datasets, using bootstrap-based intervals as one instantiation, validate the framework's correctness and demonstrate its practical utility for uncertainty-aware evaluation and decision-making.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7528\u4e8e\u533a\u95f4\u503c\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u611f\u77e5ROC\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5f15\u5165AUC_L\u548cAUC_U\u4f5c\u4e3a\u7406\u8bba\u6700\u4f18AUC\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u754c\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u9884\u6d4b\u548c\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u9884\u6d4b\u4e2d\uff0c\u533a\u95f4\u503c\u9884\u6d4b\u5bf9\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u91cf\u5316\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u6807\u51c6ROC\u66f2\u7ebf\u548cAUC\u4ec5\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u70b9\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u8bc4\u4f30\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u5bf9\u6392\u5e8f\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u611f\u77e5ROC\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4e13\u95e8\u9488\u5bf9\u533a\u95f4\u503c\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u5f15\u5165AUC_L\u548cAUC_U\u4e24\u4e2a\u65b0\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u5c06ROC\u5e73\u9762\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u6b63\u786e\u3001\u9519\u8bef\u548c\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u4e09\u4e2a\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u9884\u6d4b\u3002", "result": "\u8bc1\u660e\u5728\u6709\u6548\u7684\u7c7b\u6761\u4ef6\u8986\u76d6\u4e0b\uff0cAUC_L\u548cAUC_U\u4e3a\u7406\u8bba\u6700\u4f18AUC(AUC*)\u63d0\u4f9b\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u754c\uff0c\u523b\u753b\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u5224\u522b\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u7269\u7406\u6781\u9650\u3002\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u6846\u67b6\u7684\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u548c\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u533a\u95f4\u503c\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u9884\u6d4b\u51b3\u7b56\uff0c\u4f18\u5316\u5f03\u6743\u7387\u4e0e\u5224\u522b\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6743\u8861\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5404\u79cd\u533a\u95f4\u6784\u5efa\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

Here, we present a theoretical framework for coupled diffusion models, using coupled Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes as a tractable model. By using the nonequilibrium statistical physics of dynamical phase transitions, we demonstrate that multimodal generation is governed by a spectral hierarchy of interaction timescales rather than simultaneous resolution. A key prediction is the ``synchronization gap'', a temporal window during the reverse generative process where distinct eigenmodes stabilize at different rates, providing a theoretical explanation for common desynchronization artifacts. We derive analytical conditions for speciation and collapse times under both symmetric and anisotropic coupling regimes, establishing strict bounds for coupling strength to avoid unstable symmetry breaking. We show that the coupling strength acts as a spectral filter that enforces a tunable temporal hierarchy on generation. We support these predictions through controlled experiments with diffusion models trained on MNIST datasets and exact score samplers. These results motivate time dependent coupling schedules that target mode specific timescales, offering a potential alternative to ad hoc guidance tuning.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u8026\u5408\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u8026\u5408Ornstein-Uhlenbeck\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4f5c\u4e3a\u53ef\u5904\u7406\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u751f\u6210\u7531\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u65f6\u95f4\u5c3a\u5ea6\u7684\u8c31\u5c42\u6b21\u7ed3\u6784\u800c\u975e\u540c\u65f6\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u5e76\u9884\u6d4b\u4e86\"\u540c\u6b65\u95f4\u9699\"\u73b0\u8c61\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u57fa\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u7684\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u9ad8\u7ef4\u6570\u636e\u5408\u6210\u65b9\u9762\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u524d\u6240\u672a\u6709\u7684\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\uff0c\u4f46\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u751f\u6210\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u673a\u5236\u4ecd\u7136\u77e5\u4e4b\u751a\u5c11\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u5efa\u7acb\u7406\u89e3\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u751f\u6210\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u8026\u5408Ornstein-Uhlenbeck\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4f5c\u4e3a\u53ef\u5904\u7406\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e94\u7528\u975e\u5e73\u8861\u7edf\u8ba1\u7269\u7406\u4e2d\u7684\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u76f8\u53d8\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u63a8\u5bfc\u5bf9\u79f0\u548c\u5404\u5411\u5f02\u6027\u8026\u5408\u673a\u5236\u4e0b\u7684\u89e3\u6790\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7MNIST\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u7cbe\u786e\u5206\u6570\u91c7\u6837\u5668\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "result": "\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u751f\u6210\u7531\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u65f6\u95f4\u5c3a\u5ea6\u7684\u8c31\u5c42\u6b21\u7ed3\u6784\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u9884\u6d4b\u4e86\"\u540c\u6b65\u95f4\u9699\"\u73b0\u8c61\uff08\u53cd\u5411\u751f\u6210\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u4e0d\u540c\u7279\u5f81\u6a21\u4ee5\u4e0d\u540c\u901f\u7387\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u7a97\u53e3\uff09\uff0c\u63a8\u5bfc\u4e86\u7269\u79cd\u5f62\u6210\u548c\u5d29\u6e83\u65f6\u95f4\u7684\u89e3\u6790\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u907f\u514d\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u5bf9\u79f0\u7834\u7f3a\u7684\u8026\u5408\u5f3a\u5ea6\u4e25\u683c\u754c\u9650\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8026\u5408\u5f3a\u5ea6\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8c31\u6ee4\u6ce2\u5668\u5bf9\u751f\u6210\u65bd\u52a0\u53ef\u8c03\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u5c42\u6b21\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7ed3\u679c\u542f\u53d1\u4e86\u9488\u5bf9\u6a21\u6001\u7279\u5b9a\u65f6\u95f4\u5c3a\u5ea6\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u4f9d\u8d56\u8026\u5408\u8c03\u5ea6\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e3a\u66ff\u4ee3\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u6307\u5bfc\u8c03\u4f18\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6f5c\u5728\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

This paper focuses on achieving accurate, fast, and robust wind speed prediction by full use of cluster data with spatial-temporal correlation. First, weighted mean filtering (WMF) is applied to denoise wind speed data at the single-farm level. The Legendre memory unit (LMU) is then innovatively applied for the wind speed prediction, in combination with the Compensating Parameter based on Kendall rank correlation coefficient (CPK) of wind farm cluster data, to construct the multi-slice LMU (MSLMU). Finally, an innovative ensemble model WMF-CPK-MSLMU is proposed herein, with three key blocks: data pre-processing, forecasting, and multi-slice compensation. Advantages include: 1) LMU jointly models linear and nonlinear dependencies among farms to capture spatial-temporal correlations through backpropagation; 2) MSLMU enhances forecasting by using CPK-derived weights instead of random initialization, allowing spatial correlations to fully activate hidden nodes across clustered wind farms.; 3) CPK adaptively weights the compensation model in MSLMU and complements missing data spatially, to facilitate the whole model highly accurate and robust. Test results on different wind farm clusters indicate the effectiveness and superiority of proposed ensemble model WMF-CPK-MSLMU in the short-term prediction of wind farm clusters compared to the existing models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faWMF-CPK-MSLMU\u96c6\u6210\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u98ce\u7535\u573a\u96c6\u7fa4\u7684\u77ed\u671f\u98ce\u901f\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u52a0\u6743\u5747\u503c\u6ee4\u6ce2\u964d\u566a\u3001\u57fa\u4e8eKendall\u79e9\u76f8\u5173\u7cfb\u6570\u7684\u8865\u507f\u53c2\u6570\u548c\u591a\u5207\u7247LMU\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u51c6\u786e\u3001\u5feb\u901f\u3001\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u98ce\u7535\u573a\u96c6\u7fa4\u5316\u5e76\u7f51\uff0c\u77ed\u671f\u98ce\u901f\u9884\u6d4b\u5bf9\u7535\u529b\u7cfb\u7edf\u6b63\u5e38\u8fd0\u884c\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002\u9700\u8981\u5145\u5206\u5229\u7528\u96c6\u7fa4\u6570\u636e\u7684\u65f6\u7a7a\u76f8\u5173\u6027\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u51c6\u786e\u3001\u5feb\u901f\u3001\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u3002", "method": "1) \u4f7f\u7528\u52a0\u6743\u5747\u503c\u6ee4\u6ce2(WMF)\u5bf9\u5355\u573a\u98ce\u901f\u6570\u636e\u964d\u566a\uff1b2) \u521b\u65b0\u5e94\u7528Legendre\u8bb0\u5fc6\u5355\u5143(LMU)\u8fdb\u884c\u98ce\u901f\u9884\u6d4b\uff1b3) \u7ed3\u5408\u57fa\u4e8eKendall\u79e9\u76f8\u5173\u7cfb\u6570\u7684\u8865\u507f\u53c2\u6570(CPK)\u6784\u5efa\u591a\u5207\u7247LMU(MSLMU)\uff1b4) \u63d0\u51faWMF-CPK-MSLMU\u96c6\u6210\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u6570\u636e\u9884\u5904\u7406\u3001\u9884\u6d4b\u548c\u591a\u5207\u7247\u8865\u507f\u4e09\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u6a21\u5757\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u98ce\u7535\u573a\u96c6\u7fa4\u4e0a\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u7684WMF-CPK-MSLMU\u96c6\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u77ed\u671f\u9884\u6d4b\u65b9\u9762\u76f8\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u5177\u6709\u6709\u6548\u6027\u548c\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "WMF-CPK-MSLMU\u6a21\u578b\u901a\u8fc7\u5145\u5206\u5229\u7528\u98ce\u7535\u573a\u96c6\u7fa4\u7684\u65f6\u7a7a\u76f8\u5173\u6027\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u51c6\u786e\u3001\u5feb\u901f\u3001\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u77ed\u671f\u98ce\u901f\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u4e3a\u7535\u529b\u7cfb\u7edf\u6b63\u5e38\u8fd0\u884c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u652f\u6301\u3002"}}

Limited by the scarcity of observations, tabular datasets often exhibit critical deficiencies, such as class imbalance, selection bias, and low fidelity. To address these challenges, building on recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs), this paper introduces Team-then-Trim (T$^2$), a framework that synthesizes high-quality tabular data through a collaborative team of LLMs, followed by a rigorous three-stage plug-in data quality control (QC) pipeline. In T$^2$, tabular data generation is conceptualized as a manufacturing process: specialized LLMs, guided by domain knowledge, are tasked with generating different data components sequentially, and the resulting products, i.e., the synthetic data, are systematically evaluated across multiple dimensions of QC. Empirical results on both simulated and real-world datasets demonstrate that T$^2$ outperforms state-of-the-art methods in producing high-quality tabular data, highlighting its potential to support downstream models when direct data collection is practically infeasible.", "AI": {"tldr": "T\u00b2\u6846\u67b6\u5229\u7528LLM\u56e2\u961f\u534f\u4f5c\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u8868\u683c\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u4e09\u5c42\u8d28\u91cf\u63a7\u5236\u7ba1\u9053\u4f18\u5316\u6570\u636e\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u8868\u683c\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u5b9e\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u8868\u683c\u6570\u636e\u83b7\u53d6\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u3001\u96be\u5ea6\u5927\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5e38\u5b58\u5728\u7c7b\u522b\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u3001\u9009\u62e9\u504f\u5dee\u548c\u4f4e\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u6570\u636e\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faTeam-then-Trim (T\u00b2)\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1) \u7ec4\u7ec7\u4e13\u4e1aLLM\u56e2\u961f\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u9886\u57df\u77e5\u8bc6\u6309\u987a\u5e8f\u751f\u6210\u4e0d\u540c\u6570\u636e\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff1b2) \u5b9e\u65bd\u4e09\u5c42\u63d2\u4ef6\u5f0f\u8d28\u91cf\u63a7\u5236\u7ba1\u9053\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u7684\u591a\u4e2a\u8d28\u91cf\u7ef4\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6a21\u62df\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cT\u00b2\u5728\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u8868\u683c\u6570\u636e\u65b9\u9762\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u652f\u6301\u4e0b\u6e38\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "conclusion": "T\u00b2\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u89e3\u51b3\u8868\u683c\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5f53\u76f4\u63a5\u6570\u636e\u6536\u96c6\u4e0d\u53ef\u884c\u65f6\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u901a\u8fc7LLM\u534f\u4f5c\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u652f\u6301\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u5e94\u7528\u3002"}}

Given a nonnegative data matrix $X$, it aims at finding two lower dimensional matrices, $W$ and $H$, such that $X\\approx WH$, where the factors $W$ and $H$ are constrained to be element-wise nonnegative. The factor $W$ serves as a basis for the columns of $X$. In order to obtain more interpretable and unique solutions, minimum-volume NMF (MinVol NMF) minimizes the volume of $W$. In this paper, we consider the dual approach, where the volume of $H$ is maximized instead; this is referred to as maximum-volume NMF (MaxVol NMF). MaxVol NMF is identifiable under the same conditions as MinVol NMF in the noiseless case, but it behaves rather differently in the presence of noise. In practice, MaxVol NMF is much more effective to extract a sparse decomposition and does not generate rank-deficient solutions. In fact, we prove that the solutions of MaxVol NMF with the largest volume correspond to clustering the columns of $X$ in disjoint clusters, while the solutions of MinVol NMF with smallest volume are rank deficient. We propose two algorithms to solve MaxVol NMF. We also present a normalized variant of MaxVol NMF that exhibits better performance than MinVol NMF and MaxVol NMF, and can be interpreted as a continuum between standard NMF and orthogonal NMF. We illustrate our results in the context of hyperspectral unmixing.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u6700\u5927\u4f53\u79ef\u975e\u8d1f\u77e9\u9635\u5206\u89e3\uff08MaxVol NMF\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6700\u5927\u5316H\u7684\u4f53\u79ef\u6765\u83b7\u5f97\u66f4\u7a00\u758f\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u5206\u89e3\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u6700\u5c0f\u4f53\u79efNMF\u5728\u566a\u58f0\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u597d\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u6700\u5c0f\u4f53\u79efNMF\uff08MinVol NMF\uff09\u867d\u7136\u80fd\u83b7\u5f97\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u548c\u552f\u4e00\u7684\u89e3\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u566a\u58f0\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u53ef\u80fd\u4ea7\u751f\u79e9\u4e8f\u7f3a\u89e3\u3002\u4f5c\u8005\u63d0\u51fa\u7814\u7a76\u5176\u5bf9\u5076\u65b9\u6cd5\u2014\u2014\u6700\u5927\u4f53\u79efNMF\uff0c\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e9b\u95ee\u9898\u5e76\u83b7\u5f97\u66f4\u7a00\u758f\u7684\u5206\u89e3\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u6700\u5927\u4f53\u79efNMF\uff08MaxVol NMF\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6700\u5927\u5316\u56e0\u5b50H\u7684\u4f53\u79ef\u800c\u975e\u6700\u5c0f\u5316W\u7684\u4f53\u79ef\u3002\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e24\u79cd\u6c42\u89e3\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u53d8\u4f53\uff0c\u8be5\u53d8\u4f53\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u4e3a\u6807\u51c6NMF\u548c\u6b63\u4ea4NMF\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u8fde\u7eed\u4f53\u3002", "result": "MaxVol NMF\u5728\u65e0\u566a\u58f0\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u4e0eMinVol NMF\u5177\u6709\u76f8\u540c\u7684\u53ef\u8bc6\u522b\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u566a\u58f0\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u597d\uff1a\u80fd\u63d0\u53d6\u66f4\u7a00\u758f\u7684\u5206\u89e3\uff0c\u4e0d\u4ea7\u751f\u79e9\u4e8f\u7f3a\u89e3\uff0c\u4e14\u6700\u5927\u4f53\u79ef\u89e3\u5bf9\u5e94\u4e8e\u5c06X\u7684\u5217\u805a\u7c7b\u5230\u4e0d\u76f8\u4ea4\u7684\u7c07\u4e2d\u3002", "conclusion": "MaxVol NMF\u662fMinVol NMF\u7684\u6709\u6548\u5bf9\u5076\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u566a\u58f0\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u4f18\uff0c\u80fd\u83b7\u5f97\u66f4\u7a00\u758f\u3001\u66f4\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u5206\u89e3\uff0c\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u53d8\u4f53\u6027\u80fd\u6700\u4f73\uff0c\u5728\u9ad8\u5149\u8c31\u89e3\u6df7\u7b49\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u5b9e\u7528\u4ef7\u503c\u3002"}}

Inspired by biological systems, the framework uses a two-level architecture: evolutionary optimization (outer loop) discovers afferent sensing architectures that enable effective policy learning, while reinforcement learning (inner loop) trains damage-avoidance policies using these signals. This formalizes afferent sensing as providing an inductive bias for efficient learning: architectures are selected based on their ability to enable effective learning (rather than directly minimizing damage). We provide theoretical convergence guarantees under smoothness and bounded-noise assumptions. We illustrate the general approach in the challenging context of biomechanical digital twins operating over long time horizons (multiple decades of the life-course). Here, we find that CAT-based evolved architectures achieve significantly higher efficiency and better age-robustness than hand-designed baselines, enabling policies that exhibit age-dependent behavioral adaptation (23% reduction in high-risk actions).

These agents are typically trained in cyber gym environments using dense, highly engineered reward functions which combine many penalties and incentives for a range of (un)desirable states and costly actions. Dense rewards help alleviate the challenge of exploring complex environments but risk biasing agents towards suboptimal and potentially riskier solutions, a critical issue in complex cyber environments. We thoroughly evaluate the impact of reward function structure on learning and policy behavioural characteristics using a variety of sparse and dense reward functions, two well-established cyber gyms, a range of network sizes, and both policy gradient and value-based RL algorithms. Our evaluation is enabled by a novel ground truth evaluation approach which allows directly comparing between different reward functions, illuminating the nuanced inter-relationships between rewards, action space and the risks of suboptimal policies in cyber environments. Our results show that sparse rewards, provided they are goal aligned and can be encountered frequently, uniquely offer both enhanced training reliability and more effective cyber defence agents with lower-risk policies. Surprisingly, sparse rewards can also yield policies that are better aligned with cyber defender goals and make sparing use of costly defensive actions without explicit reward-based numerical penalties.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7a00\u758f\u5956\u52b1\u51fd\u6570\u5728\u7f51\u7edc\u5b89\u5168\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u5bc6\u96c6\u5956\u52b1\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u80fd\u4ea7\u751f\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u3001\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u3001\u98ce\u9669\u66f4\u4f4e\u7684\u9632\u5fa1\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u4e14\u65e0\u9700\u663e\u5f0f\u60e9\u7f5a\u6210\u672c\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u7f51\u7edc\u5b89\u5168\u9632\u5fa1\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u901a\u5e38\u4f7f\u7528\u5bc6\u96c6\u3001\u9ad8\u5ea6\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u5956\u52b1\u51fd\u6570\u8fdb\u884c\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u51fd\u6570\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u591a\u79cd\u60e9\u7f5a\u548c\u6fc0\u52b1\u3002\u5bc6\u96c6\u5956\u52b1\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u7f13\u89e3\u590d\u6742\u73af\u5883\u63a2\u7d22\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u4f46\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u504f\u5411\u6b21\u4f18\u4e14\u98ce\u9669\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u8fd9\u5728\u590d\u6742\u7f51\u7edc\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u662f\u4e25\u91cd\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u591a\u79cd\u7a00\u758f\u548c\u5bc6\u96c6\u5956\u52b1\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u6210\u719f\u7684\u7f51\u7edc\u8bad\u7ec3\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\uff0c\u9488\u5bf9\u4e0d\u540c\u7f51\u7edc\u89c4\u6a21\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u7b56\u7565\u68af\u5ea6\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u4ef7\u503c\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5168\u9762\u8bc4\u4f30\u5956\u52b1\u51fd\u6570\u7ed3\u6784\u5bf9\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u7b56\u7565\u884c\u4e3a\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u91c7\u7528\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5141\u8bb8\u76f4\u63a5\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e0d\u540c\u5956\u52b1\u51fd\u6570\u3002", "result": "\u7a00\u758f\u5956\u52b1\uff08\u53ea\u8981\u76ee\u6807\u5bf9\u9f50\u4e14\u80fd\u9891\u7e41\u9047\u5230\uff09\u80fd\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u548c\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u7684\u7f51\u7edc\u5b89\u5168\u9632\u5fa1\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\uff0c\u4ea7\u751f\u98ce\u9669\u66f4\u4f4e\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u3002\u4ee4\u4eba\u60ca\u8bb6\u7684\u662f\uff0c\u7a00\u758f\u5956\u52b1\u8fd8\u80fd\u4ea7\u751f\u66f4\u7b26\u5408\u7f51\u7edc\u5b89\u5168\u9632\u5fa1\u76ee\u6807\u3001\u66f4\u5c11\u4f7f\u7528\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u6602\u9632\u5fa1\u52a8\u4f5c\u7684\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u800c\u65e0\u9700\u663e\u5f0f\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u5956\u52b1\u7684\u6570\u503c\u60e9\u7f5a\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7a00\u758f\u5956\u52b1\u51fd\u6570\u5728\u7f51\u7edc\u5b89\u5168\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u72ec\u7279\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u80fd\u4ea7\u751f\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u3001\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u3001\u98ce\u9669\u66f4\u4f4e\u7684\u9632\u5fa1\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u4e14\u65e0\u9700\u663e\u5f0f\u60e9\u7f5a\u6210\u672c\u3002\u8fd9\u6311\u6218\u4e86\u5f53\u524d\u666e\u904d\u4f7f\u7528\u5bc6\u96c6\u5956\u52b1\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u505a\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e3a\u7f51\u7edc\u5b89\u5168\u9632\u5fa1\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

Konstantin Rusch"], "title": "The Key to State Reduction in Linear Attention: A Rank-based Perspective", "comment": null, "summary": "Linear attention offers a computationally efficient yet expressive alternative to softmax attention. However, recent empirical results indicate that the state of trained linear attention models often exhibits a low-rank structure, suggesting that these models underexploit their capacity in practice. To illuminate this phenomenon, we provide a theoretical analysis of the role of rank in linear attention, revealing that low effective rank can affect retrieval error by amplifying query noise. In addition to these theoretical insights, we conjecture that the low-rank states can be substantially reduced post-training with only minimal performance degradation, yielding faster and more memory-efficient models. To this end, we propose a novel hardware-aware approach that structurally prunes key and query matrices, reducing the state size while retaining compatibility with existing CUDA kernels. We adapt several existing pruning strategies to fit our framework and, building on our theoretical analysis, propose a novel structured pruning method based on a rank-revealing QR decomposition. Our empirical results, evaluated across models of varying sizes and on various downstream tasks, demonstrate the effectiveness of our state reduction framework. We highlight that our framework enables the removal of 50% of the query and key channels at only a marginal increase in perplexity.

Existing evaluations, such as microcanonical molecular dynamics (MD), are computationally expensive and primarily probe near-equilibrium states. To improve evaluation metrics for MLIPs, we introduce the Bond Smoothness Characterization Test (BSCT). This efficient benchmark probes the PES via controlled bond deformations and detects non-smoothness, including discontinuities, artificial minima, and spurious forces, both near and far from equilibrium. We show that BSCT correlates strongly with MD stability while requiring a fraction of the cost of MD. To demonstrate how BSCT can guide iterative model design, we utilize an unconstrained Transformer backbone as a testbed, illustrating how refinements such as a new differentiable $k$-nearest neighbors algorithm and temperature-controlled attention reduce artifacts identified by our metric. By optimizing model design systematically based on BSCT, the resulting MLIP simultaneously achieves a low conventional E/F regression error, stable MD simulations, and robust atomistic property predictions. Our results establish BSCT as both a validation metric and as an \"in-the-loop\" model design proxy that alerts MLIP developers to physical challenges that cannot be efficiently evaluated by current MLIP benchmarks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faBSCT\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53ef\u63a7\u952e\u53d8\u5f62\u63a2\u6d4b\u52bf\u80fd\u9762\u5e73\u6ed1\u6027\uff0c\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u5206\u5b50\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u8bc4\u4f30\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\uff0c\u80fd\u6307\u5bfcMLIP\u6a21\u578b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u539f\u5b50\u95f4\u52bf\u80fd\uff08MLIPs\uff09\u6709\u65f6\u65e0\u6cd5\u518d\u73b0\u91cf\u5b50\u52bf\u80fd\u9762\u7684\u7269\u7406\u5e73\u6ed1\u6027\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u4e0b\u6e38\u6a21\u62df\u51fa\u73b0\u9519\u8bef\u3002\u4f20\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u5982\u5fae\u6b63\u5219\u5206\u5b50\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u4e14\u4e3b\u8981\u63a2\u6d4b\u8fd1\u5e73\u8861\u6001\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u952e\u5e73\u6ed1\u6027\u8868\u5f81\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff08BSCT\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53ef\u63a7\u952e\u53d8\u5f62\u63a2\u6d4b\u52bf\u80fd\u9762\uff0c\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e0d\u8fde\u7eed\u6027\u3001\u4eba\u5de5\u6781\u5c0f\u503c\u548c\u865a\u5047\u529b\u7b49\u975e\u5e73\u6ed1\u73b0\u8c61\u3002\u4f7f\u7528\u65e0\u7ea6\u675fTransformer\u67b6\u6784\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5e73\u53f0\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u65b0\u7684\u53ef\u5fae\u5206k\u8fd1\u90bb\u7b97\u6cd5\u548c\u6e29\u5ea6\u63a7\u5236\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u6765\u51cf\u5c11BSCT\u8bc6\u522b\u7684\u4f2a\u5f71\u3002", "result": "BSCT\u4e0e\u5206\u5b50\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u5f3a\u76f8\u5173\uff0c\u4f46\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u8fdc\u4f4e\u4e8e\u5206\u5b50\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u3002\u901a\u8fc7BSCT\u6307\u5bfc\u6a21\u578b\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u5f97\u5230\u7684MLIP\u540c\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4f4e\u4f20\u7edf\u80fd\u91cf/\u529b\u56de\u5f52\u8bef\u5dee\u3001\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u5206\u5b50\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u6a21\u62df\u548c\u7a33\u5065\u7684\u539f\u5b50\u6027\u8d28\u9884\u6d4b\u3002", "conclusion": "BSCT\u65e2\u53ef\u4f5c\u4e3a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u4e5f\u53ef\u4f5c\u4e3a\"\u5faa\u73af\u5185\"\u6a21\u578b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4ee3\u7406\uff0c\u80fd\u9ad8\u6548\u8bc6\u522b\u5f53\u524dMLIP\u57fa\u51c6\u65e0\u6cd5\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u7269\u7406\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u4e3aMLIP\u5f00\u53d1\u63d0\u4f9b\u91cd\u8981\u6307\u5bfc\u3002"}}

We apply LLS to discover subsets of real-world datasets so that models trained on them exhibit behaviors ranging from having specific preferences, to responding to prompts in a different language not present in the dataset, to taking on a different persona.

In this work, we introduce a novel benchmark suite for CRL based on realistically simulated robots in the Gazebo simulator. Our Continual Robotic Simulation Suite (CRoSS) benchmarks rely on two robotic platforms: a two-wheeled differential-drive robot with lidar, camera and bumper sensor, and a robotic arm with seven joints. The former represent an agent in line-following and object-pushing scenarios, where variation of visual and structural parameters yields a large number of distinct tasks, whereas the latter is used in two goal-reaching scenarios with high-level cartesian hand position control (modeled after the Continual World benchmark), and low-level control based on joint angles. For the robotic arm benchmarks, we provide additional kinematics-only variants that bypass the need for physical simulation (as long as no sensor readings are required), and which can be run two orders of magnitude faster. CRoSS is designed to be easily extensible and enables controlled studies of continual reinforcement learning in robotic settings with high physical realism, and in particular allow the use of almost arbitrary simulated sensors. To ensure reproducibility and ease of use, we provide a containerized setup (Apptainer) that runs out-of-the-box, and report performances of standard RL algorithms, including Deep Q-Networks (DQN) and policy gradient methods.

Despite its ubiquity, we argue that the core ratio clipping mechanism in PPO is structurally ill-suited for the large vocabularies inherent to LLMs. PPO constrains policy updates based on the probability ratio of sampled tokens, which serves as a noisy single-sample Monte Carlo estimate of the true policy divergence. This creates a sub-optimal learning dynamic: updates to low-probability tokens are aggressively over-penalized, while potentially catastrophic shifts in high-probability tokens are under-constrained, leading to training inefficiency and instability. To address this, we propose Divergence Proximal Policy Optimization (DPPO), which substitutes heuristic clipping with a more principled constraint based on a direct estimate of policy divergence (e.g., Total Variation or KL). To avoid huge memory footprint, we introduce the efficient Binary and Top-K approximations to capture the essential divergence with negligible overhead.

Continual learning (CL) addresses this by adapting models over time without catastrophic forgetting. Meanwhile, contrastive learning has emerged as a powerful representation-learning paradigm that improves robustness and sample efficiency in a self-supervised manner. This paper reviews the usage of \\emph{contrastive continual learning} (CCL) for IoT, connecting algorithmic design (replay, regularization, distillation, prompts) with IoT system realities (TinyML constraints, intermittent connectivity, privacy). We present a unifying problem formulation, derive common objectives that blend contrastive and distillation losses, propose an IoT-oriented reference architecture for on-device, edge, and cloud-based CCL, and provide guidance on evaluation protocols and metrics. Finally, we highlight open unique challenges with respect to the IoT domain, such as spanning tabular and streaming IoT data, concept drift, federated settings, and energy-aware training.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7efc\u8ff0\u4e86\u5bf9\u6bd4\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u7269\u8054\u7f51\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u8fde\u63a5\u7b97\u6cd5\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e0e\u7cfb\u7edf\u73b0\u5b9e\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u7edf\u4e00\u95ee\u9898\u6846\u67b6\u3001\u53c2\u8003\u67b6\u6784\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u5357\u3002", "motivation": "\u7269\u8054\u7f51\u90e8\u7f72\u5728\u975e\u5e73\u7a33\u52a8\u6001\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u8fd0\u884c\uff0c\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u6f02\u79fb\u3001\u7528\u6237\u884c\u4e3a\u6f14\u53d8\u548c\u9690\u79c1\u9700\u6c42\u53d8\u5316\u4f1a\u5f71\u54cd\u5e94\u7528\u6548\u7528\u3002\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u901a\u8fc7\u9002\u5e94\u6a21\u578b\u800c\u4e0d\u53d1\u751f\u707e\u96be\u6027\u9057\u5fd8\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e00\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u800c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u8868\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\u8303\u5f0f\u80fd\u63d0\u9ad8\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u6837\u672c\u6548\u7387\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5bf9\u6bd4\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u95ee\u9898\u8868\u8ff0\uff0c\u63a8\u5bfc\u7ed3\u5408\u5bf9\u6bd4\u635f\u5931\u548c\u84b8\u998f\u635f\u5931\u7684\u5171\u540c\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u9762\u5411\u7269\u8054\u7f51\u7684\u53c2\u8003\u67b6\u6784\uff08\u8bbe\u5907\u7aef\u3001\u8fb9\u7f18\u3001\u4e91\u7aef\uff09\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u8bc4\u4f30\u534f\u8bae\u548c\u6307\u6807\u6307\u5357\u3002", "result": "\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u8fde\u63a5\u7b97\u6cd5\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff08\u91cd\u653e\u3001\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u3001\u84b8\u998f\u3001\u63d0\u793a\uff09\u4e0e\u7269\u8054\u7f51\u7cfb\u7edf\u73b0\u5b9e\uff08TinyML\u7ea6\u675f\u3001\u95f4\u6b47\u8fde\u63a5\u3001\u9690\u79c1\uff09\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4e3a\u7269\u8054\u7f51\u5bf9\u6bd4\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u4f9b\u7cfb\u7edf\u5316\u6307\u5bfc\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u4e3a\u7269\u8054\u7f51\u5bf9\u6bd4\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5168\u9762\u7efc\u8ff0\u548c\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5e76\u6307\u51fa\u4e86\u8be5\u9886\u57df\u9762\u4e34\u7684\u72ec\u7279\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u5904\u7406\u8868\u683c\u548c\u6d41\u5f0f\u6570\u636e\u3001\u6982\u5ff5\u6f02\u79fb\u3001\u8054\u90a6\u8bbe\u7f6e\u548c\u80fd\u91cf\u611f\u77e5\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b49\u5f00\u653e\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

Using the hierarchical nature of proteins, PAR generates structures that mimic sculpting a statue, forming a coarse topology and refining structural details over scales. To achieve this, PAR consists of three key components: (i) multi-scale downsampling operations that represent protein structures across multiple scales during training; (ii) an autoregressive transformer that encodes multi-scale information and produces conditional embeddings to guide structure generation; (iii) a flow-based backbone decoder that generates backbone atoms conditioned on these embeddings. Moreover, autoregressive models suffer from exposure bias, caused by the training and the generation procedure mismatch, and substantially degrades structure generation quality. We effectively alleviate this issue by adopting noisy context learning and scheduled sampling, enabling robust backbone generation. Notably, PAR exhibits strong zero-shot generalization, supporting flexible human-prompted conditional generation and motif scaffolding without requiring fine-tuning. On the unconditional generation benchmark, PAR effectively learns protein distributions and produces backbones of high design quality, and exhibits favorable scaling behavior. Together, these properties establish PAR as a promising framework for protein structure generation.", "AI": {"tldr": "PAR\u662f\u9996\u4e2a\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u86cb\u767d\u8d28\u9aa8\u67b6\u751f\u6210\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7c97\u5230\u7ec6\u7684\u5c3a\u5ea6\u9884\u6d4b\u5b9e\u73b0\u5206\u5c42\u7ed3\u6784\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u66dd\u5149\u504f\u5dee\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u5229\u7528\u86cb\u767d\u8d28\u7684\u5c42\u6b21\u5316\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u80fd\u591f\u6a21\u4eff\u96d5\u5851\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff08\u4ece\u7c97\u62d3\u6251\u5230\u7cbe\u7ec6\u7ed3\u6784\u7ec6\u8282\uff09\u7684\u86cb\u767d\u8d28\u7ed3\u6784\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u89e3\u51b3\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0e\u751f\u6210\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u66dd\u5149\u504f\u5dee\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u5305\u542b\u4e09\u4e2a\u6838\u5fc3\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff1a1) \u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u4e0b\u91c7\u6837\u64cd\u4f5c\uff0c\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u8868\u793a\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u86cb\u767d\u8d28\u7ed3\u6784\uff1b2) \u81ea\u56de\u5f52Transformer\u7f16\u7801\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u4fe1\u606f\u5e76\u4ea7\u751f\u6761\u4ef6\u5d4c\u5165\uff1b3) \u57fa\u4e8e\u6d41\u7684\u9aa8\u67b6\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u6839\u636e\u5d4c\u5165\u751f\u6210\u9aa8\u67b6\u539f\u5b50\u3002\u91c7\u7528\u566a\u58f0\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u8ba1\u5212\u91c7\u6837\u7f13\u89e3\u66dd\u5149\u504f\u5dee\u3002", "result": "PAR\u6709\u6548\u5b66\u4e60\u86cb\u767d\u8d28\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u9aa8\u67b6\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u826f\u597d\u7684\u7f29\u653e\u884c\u4e3a\u3002\u5728\u65e0\u6761\u4ef6\u751f\u6210\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u7075\u6d3b\u7684\u4eba\u4e3a\u63d0\u793a\u6761\u4ef6\u751f\u6210\u548c\u57fa\u5e8f\u652f\u67b6\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u5fae\u8c03\u3002", "conclusion": "PAR\u4f5c\u4e3a\u86cb\u767d\u8d28\u7ed3\u6784\u751f\u6210\u7684\u6709\u524d\u666f\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u9aa8\u67b6\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u66dd\u5149\u504f\u5dee\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}
