We argue that the heterogeneity in node types, nodal features, and\nlocal neighborhood topology poses significant challenges for ensemble learning,\nparticularly in accommodating diverse graph learners. Our HGEN framework\nensembles multiple learners through a meta-path and transformation-based\noptimization pipeline to uplift classification accuracy. Specifically, HGEN\nuses meta-path combined with random dropping to create Allele Graph Neural\nNetworks (GNNs), whereby the base graph learners are trained and aligned for\nlater ensembling. To ensure effective ensemble learning, HGEN presents two key\ncomponents: 1) a residual-attention mechanism to calibrate allele GNNs of\ndifferent meta-paths, thereby enforcing node embeddings to focus on more\ninformative graphs to improve base learner accuracy, and 2) a\ncorrelation-regularization term to enlarge the disparity among embedding\nmatrices generated from different meta-paths, thereby enriching base learner\ndiversity.

Despite\nits advantages, FL suffers from substantial communication overhead, which can\naffect training efficiency. Recent efforts have mitigated this issue by\nquantizing model updates to reduce communication costs. However, most existing\nmethods apply quantization only after local training, introducing quantization\nerrors into the trained parameters and potentially degrading model accuracy. In\nthis paper, we propose Federated Bit Freezing (FedBiF), a novel FL framework\nthat directly learns quantized model parameters during local training. In each\ncommunication round, the server first quantizes the model parameters and\ntransmits them to the clients. FedBiF then allows each client to update only a\nsingle bit of the multi-bit parameter representation, freezing the remaining\nbits. This bit-by-bit update strategy reduces each parameter update to one bit\nwhile maintaining high precision in parameter representation. Extensive\nexperiments are conducted on five widely used datasets under both IID and\nNon-IID settings. The results demonstrate that FedBiF not only achieves\nsuperior communication compression but also promotes sparsity in the resulting\nmodels. Notably, FedBiF attains accuracy comparable to FedAvg, even when using\nonly 1 bit-per-parameter (bpp) for uplink and 3 bpp for downlink communication.\nThe code is available at https://github.com/Leopold1423/fedbif-tpds25."}

Unlike providing full\nsolutions, inpainting steers exploration toward promising trajectory spaces\nwhile preserving self-generated reasoning, bridging supervised fine-tuning and\nreinforcement learning. We apply IGPO to group-based optimization methods such\nas GRPO, where exploration failures cause zero advantages and gradients. IGPO\nrestores meaningful gradients while improving sample efficiency. We also\npropose supervised fine-tuning on synthetically rewritten concise traces that\nbetter align with dLLM generation patterns. With additional techniques\nincluding entropy-based filtering, our training recipe yields substantial gains\nacross three mathematical benchmarks--GSM8K, Math500, and AMC--achieving new\nstate-of-the-art results for full-attention masked dLLMs."}

Our method addresses the quadratic computational\ncomplexity of transformers in the context length by clustering queries and keys\nseparately in their learned representation spaces, enabling a hierarchical\ntwo-stage attention mechanism. Unlike prior clustering approaches that group\nonly keys or use unified clustering, we maintain separate clusterings that\nrespect attention's asymmetric treatment of these spaces. We augment\ncentroid-based (monopole) approximations with dipole corrections that capture\ndirectional variance within clusters, preserving richer information during\ntraining. The method operates as a drop-in replacement for standard attention,\nrequiring only hyperparameter specification without architectural\nmodifications. Our approach achieves $\\mathcal{O}(NCD)$ complexity for acausal\nattention with $C$ clusters and $\\mathcal{O}(NCD \\log N)$ for causal attention.\nOn isolated attention layers, we demonstrate $3\\times$ speedup over CUDNN Flash\nAttention at 8k context length, with relative squared errors below 20%.

Although their software relies on strict\nverification and validation processes following well-established best-practices\nand certification standards, anomalies can still occur at run-time due to\nresidual faults, system and environmental modifications that were unknown at\ndesign-time, or other emergent cyber-threat scenarios. This paper explores\nrun-time control-flow anomaly detection using process mining to enhance the\nresilience of ERTMS/ETCS L2 (European Rail Traffic Management System / European\nTrain Control System Level 2). Process mining allows learning the actual\ncontrol flow of the system from its execution traces, thus enabling run-time\nmonitoring through online conformance checking. In addition, anomaly\nlocalization is performed through unsupervised machine learning to link\nrelevant deviations to critical system components. We test our approach on a\nreference ERTMS/ETCS L2 scenario, namely the RBC/RBC Handover, to show its\ncapability to detect and localize anomalies with high accuracy, efficiency, and\nexplainability."}

Communication becomes a major\nbottleneck in such settings but methods like Local Stochastic Gradient Descent\n(Local SGD) show great promise in reducing this additional communication\noverhead. Local SGD consists of three parts: a local optimization process, an\naggregation mechanism, and an outer optimizer that uses the aggregated updates\nfrom the nodes to produce a new model. While there exists an extensive\nliterature on understanding the impact of hyperparameters in the local\noptimization process, the choice of outer optimizer and its hyperparameters is\nless clear. We study the role of the outer optimizer in Local SGD, and prove\nnew convergence guarantees for the algorithm. In particular, we show that\ntuning the outer learning rate allows us to (a) trade off between optimization\nerror and stochastic gradient noise variance, and (b) make up for ill-tuning of\nthe inner learning rate. Our theory suggests that the outer learning rate\nshould sometimes be set to values greater than $1$. We extend our results to\nsettings where we use momentum in the outer optimizer, and we show a similar\nrole for the momentum-adjusted outer learning rate. We also study acceleration\nin the outer optimizer and show that it improves the convergence rate as a\nfunction of the number of communication rounds, improving upon the convergence\nrate of prior algorithms that apply acceleration locally. Finally, we also\nintroduce a novel data-dependent analysis of Local SGD that yields further\ninsights on outer learning rate tuning. We conduct comprehensive experiments\nwith standard language models and various outer optimizers to validate our\ntheory."}

We analyze dense and sparse models under various\nparallelism strategies -- tensor, pipeline, data, and expert -- and evaluate\ntheir effects on hardware utilization, power consumption, and thermal behavior.\nWe further evaluate the effectiveness of optimizations such as activation\nrecomputation and compute-communication overlap. Our findings show that\nperformance is not determined solely by scaling hardware capacity. Scale-up\nsystems with fewer, higher-memory GPUs can outperform scale-out systems in\ncommunication-bound regimes, but only under carefully tuned configurations; in\nother cases, scale-out deployments achieve superior throughput. We also show\nthat certain parallelism combinations, such as tensor with pipeline, lead to\nbandwidth underutilization due to inefficient data chunking, while increasing\nmicrobatch sizes beyond a certain point induces bursty execution and peak power\nexcursions that worsen thermal throttling. These insights reveal how training\nperformance is shaped by complex interactions between hardware, system\ntopology, and model execution.
