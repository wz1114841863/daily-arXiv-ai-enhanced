Recently, Large language models (LLMs) have become increasingly\nprevalent in tabular reasoning tasks. Previous work focuses on (1) finetuning\nLLMs using labeled data or (2) Training-free prompting LLM agents using\nchain-of-thought (CoT). Finetuning offers dataset-specific learning at the cost\nof generalizability. Training-free prompting is highly generalizable but does\nnot take full advantage of training data. In this paper, we propose a novel\nprompting-based reasoning approach, Learn then Retrieve: LRTab, which\nintegrates the benefits of both by retrieving relevant information learned from\ntraining data. We first use prompting to obtain CoT responses over the training\ndata. For incorrect CoTs, we prompt the LLM to predict Prompt Conditions to\navoid the error, learning insights from the data. We validate the effectiveness\nof Prompt Conditions using validation data. Finally, at inference time, we\nretrieve the most relevant Prompt Conditions for additional context for table\nunderstanding. We provide comprehensive experiments on WikiTQ and Tabfact,\nshowing that LRTab is interpretable, cost-efficient, and can outperform\nprevious baselines in tabular reasoning."}

Standard Neural Processes (NPs) often\nrely on a global latent variable and struggle with uncertainty calibration and\ncapturing local data dependencies. DNP addresses these limitations by\nintroducing a global latent variable to model task-level variations and a local\nlatent variable to capture input similarity within a distance-preserving latent\nspace. This is achieved through bi-Lipschitz regularization, which bounds\ndistortions in input relationships and encourages the preservation of relative\ndistances in the latent space. This modeling approach allows DNP to produce\nbetter-calibrated uncertainty estimates and more effectively distinguish in-\nfrom out-of-distribution data. Empirical results demonstrate that DNP achieves\nstrong predictive performance and improved uncertainty calibration across\nregression and classification tasks."}

To address this\ngap, we propose a constrained optimization framework that unifies alignment and\ncomposition of diffusion models by enforcing that the aligned model satisfies\nreward constraints and/or remains close to (potentially multiple) pre-trained\nmodels. We provide a theoretical characterization of the solutions to the\nconstrained alignment and composition problems and develop a Lagrangian-based\nprimal-dual training algorithm to approximate these solutions. Empirically, we\ndemonstrate the effectiveness and merits of our proposed approach in image\ngeneration, applying it to alignment and composition, and show that our aligned\nor composed model satisfies constraints effectively, and improves on the\nequally-weighted approach. Our implementation can be found at\nhttps://github.com/shervinkhalafi/constrained_comp_align."}

However, its effectiveness is often\nlimited by the high cost and low availability of reliable human input,\nespecially in domains where expert feedback is scarce or errors are costly. To\naddress this, we propose a novel framework that combines two complementary\nstrategies: probabilistic crowd modelling to handle noisy, multi-annotator\nfeedback, and active learning to prioritize feedback on the most informative\nagent actions. We extend the Advise algorithm to support multiple trainers,\nestimate their reliability online, and incorporate entropy-based query\nselection to guide feedback requests. We evaluate our approach in a set of\nenvironments that span both synthetic and real-world-inspired settings,\nincluding 2D games (Taxi, Pacman, Frozen Lake) and a blood glucose control task\nfor Type 1 Diabetes using the clinically approved UVA/Padova simulator. Our\npreliminary results demonstrate that agents trained with feedback on uncertain\ntrajectories exhibit faster learning in most tasks, and we outperform the\nbaselines for the blood glucose control task."}

We study a DAM\nbuilt upon a three-layer Boltzmann machine with Potts hidden units, which\nrepresent data clusters and classes. Through a statistical mechanics analysis,\nwe derive saddle-point equations that characterize both the stationary points\nof DAMs trained on real data and the fixed points of DAMs trained on synthetic\ndata within a teacher-student framework. Based on these results, we propose a\nnovel regularization scheme that makes training significantly more stable.\nMoreover, we show empirically that our DAM learns interpretable solutions to\nboth supervised and unsupervised classification problems. Pushing our\ntheoretical analysis further, we find that the weights learned by relatively\nsmall DAMs correspond to unstable saddle points in larger DAMs. We implement a\nnetwork-growing algorithm that leverages this saddle-point hierarchy to\ndrastically reduce the computational cost of training dense associative memory."}

We propose tower robustness to evaluate robustness, which is a\nnovel, practical metric based on hypothesis testing to quantitatively evaluate\nprobabilistic robustness, enabling more rigorous and efficient pre-deployment\nassessments.

Motivated by\nthis gap in the literature, in this paper we introduce \\emph{ambiguity-aware\nordinal} emotion representations, a novel framework that captures both the\nambiguity present in emotion annotation and the inherent temporal dynamics of\nemotional traces. Specifically, we propose approaches that model emotion\nambiguity through its rate of change. We evaluate our framework on two\naffective corpora -- RECOLA and GameVibe -- testing our proposed approaches on\nboth bounded (arousal, valence) and unbounded (engagement) continuous traces.\nOur results demonstrate that ordinal representations outperform conventional\nambiguity-aware models on unbounded labels, achieving the highest Concordance\nCorrelation Coefficient (CCC) and Signed Differential Agreement (SDA) scores,\nhighlighting their effectiveness in modeling the traces' dynamics. For bounded\ntraces, ordinal representations excel in SDA, revealing their superior ability\nto capture relative changes of annotated emotion traces."}

While LLMs integrated with tools like Python code\ninterpreters show great promise, a principled theory explaining why this\nparadigm is effective has been missing. This work provides the first formal\nproof that TIR fundamentally expands an LLM's capabilities. We demonstrate that\ntools enable a strict expansion of the model's empirical and feasible support,\nbreaking the capability ceiling of pure-text models by unlocking\nproblem-solving strategies that are otherwise impossible or intractably\nverbose. To guide model behavior without compromising training stability and\nperformance, we also introduce Advantage Shaping Policy Optimization (ASPO), a\nnovel algorithm that directly modifies the advantage function to guide the\npolicy behavior. We conduct comprehensive experiments on challenging\nmathematical benchmarks, leveraging a Python interpreter as the external tool.\nOur results show that the TIR model decisively outperforms its pure-text\ncounterpart on the pass@k metric. Crucially, this advantage is not confined to\ncomputationally-intensive problems but extends to those requiring significant\nabstract insight. We further identify the emergent cognitive patterns that\nillustrate how models learn to think with tools. Finally, we report improved\ntool usage behavior with early code invocation and much more interactive turns\nwith ASPO. Overall, our work provides the first principled explanation for\nTIR's success, shifting the focus from the mere fact that tools work to why and\nhow they enable more powerful reasoning."}

DL task collocation on GPUs is an opportunity to\naddress this challenge. However, it may result in (1) out-of-memory crashes for\nthe subsequently arriving task and (2) slowdowns for all tasks sharing the GPU\ndue to resource interference. The former challenge poses a threat to\nrobustness, while the latter affects the quality of service and energy\nefficiency.\n  We propose CARMA, a server-scale task-level collocation-aware resource\nmanagement system that handles both collocation challenges. CARMA encompasses\nGPUMemNet, a novel ML-based GPU memory estimator framework for DL training\ntasks, to minimize out-of-memory errors and introduces collocation policies\nthat cap GPU utilization to minimize interference. Furthermore, CARMA\nintroduces a recovery method to ensure robust restart of tasks that crash. Our\nevaluation on traces modeled after real-world DL training task traces shows\nthat CARMA increases the GPU utilization over time by 39.3\\%, decreases the\nend-to-end execution time by $\\sim$26.7\\%, and reduces the GPU energy use by\n$\\sim$14.2\\%."}
