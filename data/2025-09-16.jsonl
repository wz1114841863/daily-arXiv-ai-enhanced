Two seminal results established\nimpossibility of a solution in the oblivious robot (OBLOT) model in a\n$(2,0)$-fault system under semi-synchrony and in a $(3,1)$-Byzantine fault\nsystem under asynchrony. Recently, a breakthrough result circumvented the first\nimpossibility result by giving a deterministic algorithm in a $(2,0)$-fault\nsystem under asynchrony in the luminous robot (LUMI) model using 2-colored\nlights. However, a breakthrough result established impossibility of gathering\nin a $(2,1)$-crash system in the LUMI model under semi-synchrony. In this\npaper, we consider a {\\em mobility fault} model in which a robot crash only\nimpacts it mobility but not the operation of the light.\n  We establish four results under asynchrony in LUMI with the mobility fault\nmodel. We show that it is impossible to solve gathering in a $(2,1)$-mobility\nfault system using 2-colored lights, and then give a solution using 3-colored\nlights, which is optimal w.r.t. the number of colors. We then consider an\n$(N,f)$-mobility fault system, $f<N$, both $N,f$ not known, and give two\ndeterministic algorithms that exhibit a nice time-color trade-off: The first\nwith time $O(N)$ using 7-colored lights and the second with time\n$O(\\max\\{\\ell,f\\})$ using 26-colored lights, where $\\ell< N$ is the number of\ndistinct convex layers of robot positions in the initial configuration.\nInterestingly, for $l, f = O(1)$, our result is optimal. Our algorithms for an\n$(N,f)$-mobility fault system are the first to be analysed time complexity, can\nwithstand obstructed visibility (opaque robot model) and asynchronous\nscheduling."}

Unfortunately, existing data loaders\nturn out to waste GPU resources, with $76\\%$ GPU idleness when using the\nPyTorch data loader, for example. One key source of inefficiency is the\nvariability in preprocessing time across samples within the same dataset.\nExisting data loaders are oblivious to this variability, and they construct\nbatches without any consideration of slow or fast samples.

Despite its widespread adoption, MPI's low-level\ninterface and lack of built-in type safety make it prone to runtime errors,\nundefined behavior, and debugging challenges, especially in large-scale\napplications. Rust, a modern systems programming language, offers a compelling\nsolution with its strong type system, which enforces memory and type safety at\ncompile time without compromising performance. This paper introduces a\ntype-safe communication framework for MPI, built on the RSMPI library, to\naddress the limitations of traditional MPI programming. At its core is the\nTypedCommunicator, an abstraction that enforces static type safety in\npoint-to-point communication operations. By leveraging Rust's Equivalence\ntrait, our framework guarantees that only compatible types can participate in\ncommunication, catching mismatches either at compile time or through runtime\nvalidation. The framework supports both single-value and slice-based\ncommunication, providing an intuitive API for diverse data structures.

In this study, we assess the effectiveness and implications of\nminimum wage regulation in ride-sourcing markets while simulating the detailed\ndynamics of ride-sourcing markets under varying regulation intensities, both\nwith and without the so-called platform lockout strategy. Our findings reveal\nthat minimum wage regulation impacts substantially drivers income, and may lead\nto higher fares for travelers and threaten platforms survival.

To optimize these\noperations at hardware accelerators, multiplierless constant multiplication\n(MCM) blocks offer a promising solution.

Six different MCM block architectures for angular intra\nprediction are introduced, in which five use the approximation method\nintroduced in this work, and evaluate the trade-off between coefficient\nreduction and coding efficiency compared with a conventional multiplier\narchitecture.

Prevailing\ndistributed paradigms, while powerful in their intended domains, were not\ndesigned for this stringent regime and thus face fundamental challenges. This\npaper demonstrates that resolving this trilemma requires a shift in perspective\n- from seeking engineering trade-offs to deriving solutions from logical\nnecessity. We establish a rigorous axiomatic system that formalizes these\nphysical constraints and prove that for the broad class of computations\nadmitting an idempotent merge operator, there exists a unique, optimal\nparadigm. Any system satisfying these axioms must converge to a single normal\nform: Self-Describing Parallel Flows (SDPF), a purely data-centric model where\nstateless executors process flows that carry their own control logic. We\nfurther prove this unique paradigm is convergent, Turing-complete, and minimal.\nIn the same way that the CAP theorem established a boundary for what is\nimpossible in distributed state management, our work provides a constructive\ndual: a uniqueness theorem that reveals what is \\textit{inevitable} for\ndistributed computation flows under physical law."}

Traditional pruning approaches often depend on\nhand-crafted heuristics and local optimization perspectives, which can lead to\nsuboptimal performance and inefficient pruning strategies. Our framework\ntransforms the pruning process by introducing a graph representation of the\ntarget neural network that captures complete topological relationships between\nlayers and channels, replacing the limited layer-wise observation space with a\nglobal view of network structure. The core innovations include a Graph\nAttention Network (GAT) encoder that processes the network's graph\nrepresentation and generates a rich embedding. Additionally, for the action\nspace we transition from continuous pruning ratios to fine-grained binary\naction spaces which enables the agent to learn optimal channel importance\ncriteria directly from data, moving away from predefined scoring functions.\nThese contributions are modelled within a Constrained Markov Decision Process\n(CMDP) framework, allowing the agent to make informed pruning decisions while\nadhering to resource constraints such as target compression rates.

A strong correlation was found between DCS and HES (rs = .77).\nModel performance varied widely, indicating that safety is not an emergent\nproperty of scale alone.\n  Conclusion: This study establishes LLM psychogenicity as a quantifiable risk\nand underscores the urgent need for re-thinking how we train LLMs. We frame\nthis issue not merely as a technical challenge but as a public health\nimperative requiring collaboration between developers, policymakers, and\nhealthcare professionals."}

With multicore architectures becoming\ncommonplace, traditional prefetchers are severely challenged. Independent core\noperation creates significant redundancy (up to 20% of prefetch requests are\nduplicates), causing unnecessary memory bus traffic and wasted bandwidth.\nFurthermore, cutting-edge prefetchers such as Pythia suffer from about a 10%\nperformance loss when scaling from a single-core to a four-core system. To\nsolve these problems, we propose CRL-Pythia, a coordinated reinforcement\nlearning based prefetcher specifically designed for multicore systems. In this\nwork, CRL-Pythia addresses these issues by enabling cross-core sharing of\ninformation and cooperative prefetching decisions, which greatly reduces\nredundant prefetch requests and improves learning convergence across cores. Our\nexperiments demonstrate that CRL-Pythia outperforms single Pythia\nconfigurations in all cases, with approximately 12% IPC (instructions per\ncycle) improvement for bandwidth-constrained workloads, while imposing moderate\nhardware overhead. Our sensitivity analyses also verify its robustness and\nscalability, thereby making CRL-Pythia a practical and efficient solution to\ncontemporary multicore systems."}

Accepted by EPJ Quantum\n  Technology", "summary": "Protein-ligand binding affinity is critical in drug discovery, but\nexperimentally determining it is time-consuming and expensive. Artificial\nintelligence (AI) has been used to predict binding affinity, significantly\naccelerating this process. However, the high-performance requirements and vast\ndatasets involved in affinity prediction demand increasingly large AI models,\nrequiring substantial computational resources and training time. Quantum\nmachine learning has emerged as a promising solution to these challenges. In\nparticular, hybrid quantum-classical models can reduce the number of parameters\nwhile maintaining or improving performance compared to classical counterparts.\nDespite these advantages, challenges persist: why hybrid quantum models achieve\nthese benefits, whether quantum neural networks (QNNs) can replace classical\nneural networks, and whether such models are feasible on noisy\nintermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices. This study addresses these\nchallenges by proposing a hybrid quantum neural network (HQNN) that empirically\ndemonstrates the capability to approximate non-linear functions in the latent\nfeature space derived from classical embedding. The primary goal of this study\nis to achieve a parameter-efficient model in binding affinity prediction while\nensuring feasibility on NISQ devices. Numerical results indicate that HQNN\nachieves comparable or superior performance and parameter efficiency compared\nto classical neural networks, underscoring its potential as a viable\nreplacement. This study highlights the potential of hybrid QML in computational\ndrug discovery, offering insights into its applicability and advantages in\naddressing the computational challenges of protein-ligand binding affinity\nprediction."}

Recently, advanced and complex data processing has\ngained increasing importance in science experiments. Data processing workflows\ntypically consist of multiple intricate steps, and the precise specification of\nresource requirements is crucial for each step to allocate optimal resources\nfor effective processing. Estimating resource requirements in advance is\nchallenging due to a wide range of analysis scenarios, varying skill levels\namong community members, and the continuously increasing spectrum of computing\noptions. One practical approach to mitigate these challenges involves initially\nprocessing a subset of each step to measure precise resource utilization from\nactual processing profiles before completing the entire step. While this\ntwo-staged approach enables processing on optimal resources for most of the\nworkflow, it has drawbacks such as initial inaccuracies leading to potential\nfailures and suboptimal resource usage, along with overhead from waiting for\ninitial processing completion, which is critical for fast-turnaround analyses.\nIn this context, our study introduces a novel pipeline of machine learning\nmodels within a comprehensive workflow management system, the Production and\nDistributed Analysis (PanDA) system. These models employ advanced machine\nlearning techniques to predict key resource requirements, overcoming challenges\nposed by limited upfront knowledge of characteristics at each step. Accurate\nforecasts of resource requirements enable informed and proactive\ndecision-making in workflow management, enhancing the efficiency of handling\ndiverse, complex workflows across heterogeneous resources."}

Existing\nframeworks suffer from the trade-off between design flexibility and\nproductivity of RTL generation: either limited to very few hand-written\ntemplates or cannot automatically generate the RTL. To address this challenge,\nwe propose the LEGO framework, which targets tensor applications and\nautomatically generates spatial architecture design and outputs synthesizable\nRTL code without handwritten RTL design templates. Leveraging the\naffine-transformation-based architecture representation, LEGO front end finds\ninterconnections between function units, synthesizes the memory system, and\nfuses different spatial dataflow designs based on data reuse analysis. LEGO\nback end then translates the hardware in a primitive-level graph to perform\nlower-level optimizations, and applies a set of linear-programming algorithms\nto optimally insert pipeline registers and reduce the overhead of unused logic\nwhen switching spatial dataflows. Our evaluation demonstrates that LEGO can\nachieve 3.2x speedup and 2.4x energy efficiency compared to previous work\nGemmini, and can generate one architecture for diverse modern foundation models\nin generative AI applications."}
