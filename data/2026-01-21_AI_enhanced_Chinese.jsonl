A traditional fermentation tank is equipped with a piezoelectric transducer able to irradiate the tank with ultrasonic waves, providing an external abiotic stimulus to enhance the growth of yeast and accelerate the fermentation process. At its core, the digital twin incorporates a predictive model that estimates yeast's culture density over time based on the surrounding environmental conditions. To this end, we implement, tailor and extend the model proposed in Palacios et al., allowing us to effectively handle the limited number of available training samples by using temperature, ultrasonic frequency, and duty cycle as inputs.

However, supply chain entities involved in the design and fabrication of COTS components are considered untrusted from the consumer's standpoint due to the potential insertion of hidden malicious logic or hardware Trojans (HTs). Existing solutions to detect Trojans are largely inapplicable for COTS components due to their black-box nature and lack of access to a golden model. A few studies that apply require expensive equipment, lack scalability, and apply to a limited class of Trojans. In this work, we present a novel golden-free trust verification framework, COVERT for COTS microprocessors, which can efficiently test the presence of hardware Trojan implants by identifying microarchitectural rare events and transferring activation knowledge from existing processor designs to trigger highly susceptible internal nodes. COVERT leverages Large Language Models to automatically generate test programs that trigger rare microarchitectural events, which may be exploited to develop Trojan trigger conditions. By deriving these events from publicly available Register Transfer Level implementations, COVERT can verify a wide variety of COTS microprocessors that inherit the same Instruction Set Architecture. We have evaluated the proposed framework on open-source RISC-V COTS microprocessors and demonstrated its effectiveness in activating combinational and sequential Trojan triggers with high coverage, highlighting the efficiency of the trust verification. By pruning rare microarchitectural events from mor1kx Cappuccino OpenRISC processor design, COVERT has been able to achieve more than 80% trigger coverage for the rarest 5% of events in or1k Marocchino and PicoRV32 as COTS processors.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faCOVERT\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u9ec4\u91d1\u6a21\u578b\u5373\u53ef\u68c0\u6d4bCOTS\u5fae\u5904\u7406\u5668\u4e2d\u7684\u786c\u4ef6\u6728\u9a6c\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7LLM\u751f\u6210\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7a0b\u5e8f\u89e6\u53d1\u7f55\u89c1\u5fae\u67b6\u6784\u4e8b\u4ef6\u6765\u6fc0\u6d3b\u6f5c\u5728\u6728\u9a6c\u89e6\u53d1\u5668", "motivation": "COTS\u786c\u4ef6\u5e7f\u6cdb\u4f7f\u7528\u4f46\u4f9b\u5e94\u94fe\u4e0d\u53ef\u4fe1\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u6728\u9a6c\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0d\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u9ed1\u76d2COTS\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u65e0\u9700\u9ec4\u91d1\u6a21\u578b\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8eLLM\u81ea\u52a8\u751f\u6210\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7a0b\u5e8f\u89e6\u53d1\u7f55\u89c1\u5fae\u67b6\u6784\u4e8b\u4ef6\uff0c\u4ece\u516c\u5f00RTL\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e2d\u63a8\u5bfc\u4e8b\u4ef6\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u5c06\u6fc0\u6d3b\u77e5\u8bc6\u8fc1\u79fb\u5230\u4e0d\u540c\u5904\u7406\u5668\u8bbe\u8ba1", "result": "\u5728RISC-V COTS\u5fae\u5904\u7406\u5668\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u80fd\u9ad8\u8986\u76d6\u7387\u6fc0\u6d3b\u7ec4\u5408\u548c\u65f6\u5e8f\u6728\u9a6c\u89e6\u53d1\u5668\uff0c\u5bf9\u6700\u7f55\u89c15%\u4e8b\u4ef6\u5b9e\u73b0\u8d85\u8fc780%\u89e6\u53d1\u8986\u76d6\u7387", "conclusion": "COVERT\u63d0\u4f9b\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u65e0\u9700\u9ec4\u91d1\u6a21\u578b\u7684COTS\u5fae\u5904\u7406\u5668\u4fe1\u4efb\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u80fd\u68c0\u6d4b\u591a\u79cd\u786c\u4ef6\u6728\u9a6c\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4ef7\u503c"}}

Although stabilizers commute and admit many valid execution orders, different schedules induce distinct error-propagation paths under realistic noise, leading to large variations in logical error rate. Outside of surface codes, effective syndrome-measurement scheduling remains largely unexplored. We present AlphaSyndrome, an automated synthesis framework for scheduling syndrome-measurement circuits in general commuting-stabilizer codes under minimal assumptions: mutually commuting stabilizers and a heuristic decoder. AlphaSyndrome formulates scheduling as an optimization problem that shapes error propagation to (i) avoid patterns close to logical operators and (ii) remain within the decoder's correctable region. The framework uses Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to explore ordering and parallelism, guided by code structure and decoder feedback. Across diverse code families, sizes, and decoders, AlphaSyndrome reduces logical error rates by 80.6% on average (up to 96.2%) relative to depth-optimal baselines, matches Google's hand-crafted surface-code schedules, and outperforms IBM's schedule for the Bivariate Bicycle code.", "AI": {"tldr": "AlphaSyndrome\uff1a\u4e00\u4e2a\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u4f18\u5316\u91cf\u5b50\u7ea0\u9519\u7801\u4e2d\u7684\u75c7\u72b6\u6d4b\u91cf\u8c03\u5ea6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8499\u7279\u5361\u6d1b\u6811\u641c\u7d22\u51cf\u5c11\u903b\u8f91\u9519\u8bef\u7387", "motivation": "\u91cf\u5b50\u7ea0\u9519\u4e2d\u91cd\u590d\u7684\u75c7\u72b6\u6d4b\u91cf\u5faa\u73af\u5360\u636e\u4e86\u4e3b\u8981\u7684\u65f6\u7a7a\u548c\u786c\u4ef6\u6210\u672c\u3002\u867d\u7136\u7a33\u5b9a\u5b50\u53ef\u4ea4\u6362\u5e76\u5141\u8bb8\u591a\u79cd\u6267\u884c\u987a\u5e8f\uff0c\u4f46\u4e0d\u540c\u8c03\u5ea6\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u566a\u58f0\u4e0b\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u9519\u8bef\u4f20\u64ad\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u9020\u6210\u903b\u8f91\u9519\u8bef\u7387\u7684\u5de8\u5927\u5dee\u5f02\u3002\u9664\u4e86\u8868\u9762\u7801\u5916\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u7684\u75c7\u72b6\u6d4b\u91cf\u8c03\u5ea6\u7814\u7a76\u8f83\u5c11\u3002", "method": "AlphaSyndrome\u5c06\u8c03\u5ea6\u95ee\u9898\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u4e3a\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8499\u7279\u5361\u6d1b\u6811\u641c\u7d22\u63a2\u7d22\u6392\u5e8f\u548c\u5e76\u884c\u6027\u3002\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5229\u7528\u4ee3\u7801\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u53cd\u9988\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u4f7f\u9519\u8bef\u4f20\u64ad\u907f\u514d\u63a5\u8fd1\u903b\u8f91\u7b97\u5b50\u7684\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u5e76\u4fdd\u6301\u5728\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u53ef\u7ea0\u6b63\u533a\u57df\u5185\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u4ee3\u7801\u65cf\u3001\u5c3a\u5bf8\u548c\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u4e2d\uff0cAlphaSyndrome\u76f8\u5bf9\u4e8e\u6df1\u5ea6\u6700\u4f18\u57fa\u7ebf\u5e73\u5747\u51cf\u5c1180.6%\u7684\u903b\u8f91\u9519\u8bef\u7387\uff08\u6700\u9ad8\u8fbe96.2%\uff09\uff0c\u4e0eGoogle\u624b\u5de5\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u8868\u9762\u7801\u8c03\u5ea6\u76f8\u5339\u914d\uff0c\u5e76\u4f18\u4e8eIBM\u7684\u53cc\u53d8\u91cf\u81ea\u884c\u8f66\u7801\u8c03\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "AlphaSyndrome\u4e3a\u4e00\u822c\u53ef\u4ea4\u6362\u7a33\u5b9a\u5b50\u7801\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u75c7\u72b6\u6d4b\u91cf\u8c03\u5ea6\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u903b\u8f91\u9519\u8bef\u7387\uff0c\u4e3a\u91cf\u5b50\u7ea0\u9519\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u91cd\u8981\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

While these approaches raise the bar against attacks, they incur substantial overhead, much of which arises not from genuine functional reconfigurability need, but from artificial complexity intended solely to frustrate reverse engineering (RE). As a result, fabrics are often underutilized, and security is achieved at disproportionate cost. This paper introduces NuRedact, the first full-custom eFPGA redaction framework that embraces architectural non-uniformity to balance security and efficiency. Built as an extension of the widely adopted OpenFPGA infrastructure, NuRedact introduces a three-stage methodology: (i) custom fabric generation with pin-mapping irregularity, (ii) VPR-level modifications to enable non-uniform placement guided by an automated Python-based optimizer, and (iii) redaction-aware reconfiguration and mapping of target IP modules. Experimental results show up to 9x area reduction compared to conventional uniform fabrics, achieving competitive efficiency with LUT-based and even transistor-level redaction techniques while retaining strong resilience. From a security perspective, NuRedact fabrics are evaluated against state-of-the-art attack models, including SAT-based, cyclic, and sequential variants, and show enhanced resilience while maintaining practical design overheads.", "AI": {"tldr": "NuRedact\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u975e\u5747\u5300eFPGA\u91cd\u5199\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u67b6\u6784\u975e\u5747\u5300\u6027\u5e73\u8861\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u548c\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u5747\u5300\u7ed3\u6784\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u8fbe9\u500d\u9762\u79ef\u51cf\u5c11\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u5f3a\u5927\u6297\u653b\u51fb\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u53ef\u91cd\u6784\u7684\u91cd\u5199\u6280\u672f\uff08\u5982LUT\u548ceFPGA\u65b9\u6848\uff09\u867d\u7136\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u5b89\u5168\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u5e26\u6765\u4e86\u5de8\u5927\u5f00\u9500\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5f00\u9500\u4e3b\u8981\u6765\u81ea\u4e3a\u963b\u788d\u9006\u5411\u5de5\u7a0b\u800c\u4eba\u4e3a\u589e\u52a0\u7684\u590d\u6742\u6027\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u771f\u6b63\u7684\u529f\u80fd\u53ef\u91cd\u6784\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u7ed3\u6784\u5229\u7528\u7387\u4f4e\u4e14\u5b89\u5168\u6210\u672c\u8fc7\u9ad8\u3002", "method": "NuRedact\u91c7\u7528\u4e09\u9636\u6bb5\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a1\uff09\u751f\u6210\u5177\u6709\u5f15\u811a\u6620\u5c04\u4e0d\u89c4\u5219\u6027\u7684\u5b9a\u5236\u7ed3\u6784\uff1b2\uff09\u4fee\u6539VPR\u7ea7\u5de5\u5177\u4ee5\u652f\u6301\u57fa\u4e8ePython\u4f18\u5316\u5668\u7684\u975e\u5747\u5300\u5e03\u5c40\uff1b3\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u91cd\u5199\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u76ee\u6807IP\u6a21\u5757\u91cd\u914d\u7f6e\u548c\u6620\u5c04\u3002\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u57fa\u4e8eOpenFPGA\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\u6784\u5efa\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u5747\u5300\u7ed3\u6784\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u8fbe9\u500d\u9762\u79ef\u51cf\u5c11\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u5f3a\u5927\u6297\u653b\u51fb\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u8fbe\u5230\u4e0eLUT\u57fa\u751a\u81f3\u6676\u4f53\u7ba1\u7ea7\u91cd\u5199\u6280\u672f\u76f8\u7ade\u4e89\u7684\u6548\u7387\u3002\u5b89\u5168\u8bc4\u4f30\u8868\u660e\u5bf9SAT\u57fa\u3001\u5faa\u73af\u548c\u65f6\u5e8f\u53d8\u4f53\u7b49\u5148\u8fdb\u653b\u51fb\u6a21\u578b\u5177\u6709\u589e\u5f3a\u7684\u62b5\u6297\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "NuRedact\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u67b6\u6784\u975e\u5747\u5300\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u548c\u6548\u7387\u4e4b\u95f4\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u5e73\u8861\uff0c\u4e3a\u96c6\u6210\u7535\u8def\u4f9b\u5e94\u94fe\u5b89\u5168\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u5b9e\u7528\u7684\u91cd\u5199\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u53ef\u63a5\u53d7\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5f00\u9500\u3002"}}

On this issue, one promising approach is to reuse intermediate computational results across different queries to eliminate redundant computation. But most existing approaches, such as KV cache reuse and semantic cache reuse, are designed for cloud settings and perform poorly, overlooking the distinctive characteristics of mobile RAG.\n  We propose PerCache, a novel hierarchical cache solution designed for reducing end-to-end latency of personalized RAG applications on mobile platforms. PerCache adopts a hierarchical architecture that progressively matches similar queries and QKV cache to maximize the reuse of intermediate results at different computing stages. To improve cache hit rate, PerCache applies a predictive method to populate cache with queries that are likely to be raised in the future. In addition, PerCache can adapt its configurations to dynamic system loads, aiming at maximizing the caching utility with minimal resource consumption. We implement PerCache on top of an existing mobile LLM inference engine with commodity mobile phones.

Simulation-based study on cost-aware log retention", "summary": "Log data plays a critical role in observability, debugging, and performance monitoring in modern cloud-native systems. In small and early-stage cloud deployments, however, log retention policies are frequently configured far beyond operational requirements, often defaulting to 90 days or more, without explicit consideration of their financial and performance implications. As a result, excessive log retention becomes a hidden and recurring cost.\n  This study examines the financial and operational impact of log retention window selection from a cost-aware perspective. Using synthetic log datasets designed to reflect real-world variability in log volume and access patterns, we evaluate retention windows of 7, 14, 30, and 90 days. The analysis focuses on three metrics: storage cost, operationally useful log ratio, and cost per useful log. Operational usefulness is defined as log data accessed during simulated debugging and incident analysis tasks.\n  The results show that reducing log retention from 90 days to 14 days can lower log storage costs by up to 78 percent while preserving more than 97 percent of operationally useful logs. Longer retention windows provide diminishing operational returns while disproportionately increasing storage cost and query overhead. These findings suggest that modest configuration changes can yield significant cost savings without compromising system reliability.\n  Rather than proposing new logging mechanisms, this work offers a lightweight and accessible framework to help small engineering teams reason about log retention policies through a cost-effectiveness lens.

However, continued scaling exposes critical limitations in hardware, including constraints on computation, bandwidth, and memory. These dimensions are tightly interconnected, so improvements in one often create bottlenecks in others, making isolated optimizations less effective. Balancing them to maximize system efficiency remains a central challenge in scalable AI design. To address this challenge, we introduce {Computation-Bandwidth-Memory Trade-offs}, termed the {AI Trinity}, a unified paradigm that positions {computation}, {bandwidth}, and {memory} as coequal pillars for next-generation AI infrastructure. AI Trinity enables dynamic allocation of resources across these pillars, alleviating single-resource bottlenecks and adapting to diverse scenarios to optimize system performance. Within this framework, AI Trinity identifies three fundamental trade-offs: (1) {More Computation$\\rightarrow$Less Bandwidth}, wherein computational resources are exploited to reduce data transmission under limited bandwidth conditions, (2) {More Bandwidth$\\rightarrow$Less Memory}, which exploits abundant communication capacity to populate or refresh memory when local storage resources are constrained, and (3) {More Memory$\\rightarrow$Less Computation}, whereby storage capacity are utilized to mitigate redundant computation when computational costs are prohibitive. We illustrate the effectiveness of AI Trinity through representative system designs spanning edge-cloud communication, large-scale distributed training, and model inference. The innovations embodied in AI Trinity advance a new paradigm for scalable AI infrastructure, providing both a conceptual foundation and practical guidance for a broad range of application scenarios.", "AI": {"tldr": "AI Trinity\u63d0\u51fa\u8ba1\u7b97-\u5e26\u5bbd-\u5185\u5b58\u4e09\u8981\u7d20\u6743\u8861\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u8d44\u6e90\u5206\u914d\u4f18\u5316AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u5355\u4e00\u8d44\u6e90\u74f6\u9888\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u89c4\u6a21AI\u6a21\u578b\u53d1\u5c55\u9762\u4e34\u786c\u4ef6\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u3001\u5e26\u5bbd\u548c\u5185\u5b58\u4e09\u4e2a\u7ef4\u5ea6\u76f8\u4e92\u5236\u7ea6\uff0c\u5355\u4e00\u4f18\u5316\u5f80\u5f80\u5bfc\u81f4\u5176\u4ed6\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u7684\u5e73\u8861\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faAI Trinity\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u8ba1\u7b97\u3001\u5e26\u5bbd\u3001\u5185\u5b58\u89c6\u4e3a\u540c\u7b49\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u4e09\u5927\u652f\u67f1\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u4e09\u8005\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u4e09\u4e2a\u57fa\u672c\u6743\u8861\u5173\u7cfb\uff1a\u66f4\u591a\u8ba1\u7b97\u2192\u66f4\u5c11\u5e26\u5bbd\u3001\u66f4\u591a\u5e26\u5bbd\u2192\u66f4\u5c11\u5185\u5b58\u3001\u66f4\u591a\u5185\u5b58\u2192\u66f4\u5c11\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u52a8\u6001\u8d44\u6e90\u5206\u914d\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u8fb9\u7f18-\u4e91\u901a\u4fe1\u3001\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u7b49\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5c55\u793a\u4e86AI Trinity\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u7f13\u89e3\u5355\u4e00\u8d44\u6e90\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u9002\u5e94\u591a\u6837\u5316\u573a\u666f\u3002", "conclusion": "AI Trinity\u4e3a\u53ef\u6269\u5c55AI\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u65e2\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6982\u5ff5\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u53c8\u4e3a\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u573a\u666f\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u8df5\u6307\u5bfc\u3002"}}

Code available at: https://github.com/Yogeeth/neuromorphic-lif-rtl", "summary": "The deployment of Artificial Intelligence on edge devices (TinyML) is often constrained by the high power consumption and latency associated with traditional Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) and their reliance on intensive Matrix-Multiply (MAC) operations. Neuromorphic computing offers a compelling alternative by mimicking biological efficiency through event-driven processing. This paper presents the design and implementation of a cycle-accurate, hardware-oriented Spiking Neural Network (SNN) core implemented in SystemVerilog. Unlike conventional accelerators, this design utilizes a Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) neuron model powered by fixed-point arithmetic and bit-wise primitives (shifts and additions) to eliminate the need for complex floating-point hardware. The architecture features an on-chip Poisson encoder for stochastic spike generation and a novel active pruning mechanism that dynamically disables neurons post-classification to minimize dynamic power consumption. We demonstrate the hardware's efficacy through a fully connected layer implementation targeting digit classification. Simulation results indicate that the design achieves rapid convergence (89% accuracy) within limited timesteps while maintaining a significantly reduced computational footprint compared to traditional dense architectures.

We demonstrate that the L2 normalization constraint, a characteristic of many LLM architectures, results in a structured embedding space suitable for analysis using a Hamiltonian formalism. We derive relationships between cosine similarity and perturbations of embedding vectors, and explore direct and indirect semantic transitions. Furthermore, we explore a quantum-inspired perspective, deriving an analogue of zero-point energy and discussing potential connections to Koopman-von Neumann mechanics.

In this paper, we propose CD-PIM to address these challenges through three key innovations. First, we introduce a high-bandwidth compute-efficient mode (HBCEM) that enhances bandwidth by dividing each bank into four pseudo-banks through segmented global bitlines. Second, we propose a low-batch interleaving mode (LBIM) to improve component utilization by overlapping GEMV operations with GEMM operations. Third, we design a compute-efficient CU that performs enhanced GEMV operations in a pipelined manner by serially feeding weight data into the computing core. Forth, we adopt a column-wise mapping for the key-cache matrix and row-wise mapping for the value-cache matrix, which fully utilizes CU resources. Our evaluation shows that compared to a GPU-only baseline and state-of-the-art PIM designs, our CD-PIM achieves 11.42x and 4.25x speedup on average within a single batch in HBCEM mode, respectively. Moreover, for low-batch sizes, the CD-PIM achieves an average speedup of 1.12x in LBIM compared to HBCEM.", "AI": {"tldr": "CD-PIM\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u9488\u5bf9\u8fb9\u7f18\u4f4e\u6279\u6b21LLM\u90e8\u7f72\u7684\u5185\u5b58\u5904\u7406\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9ad8\u5e26\u5bbd\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u6a21\u5f0f\u3001\u4f4e\u6279\u6b21\u4ea4\u9519\u6a21\u5f0f\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u5355\u5143\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709PIM\u67b6\u6784\u7684\u5e26\u5bbd\u9650\u5236\u3001\u7ec4\u4ef6\u5229\u7528\u4e0d\u8db3\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u80fd\u529b\u4f4e\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u8fb9\u7f18\u90e8\u7f72\u4f4e\u6279\u6b21\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u9762\u4e34\u5185\u5b58\u5e26\u5bbd\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u6570\u5b57\u5185\u5b58\u5904\u7406\u67b6\u6784\u5b58\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u9650\u5236\uff1a\u5e26\u5bbd\u6539\u8fdb\u6709\u9650\u3001\u6df7\u5408\u5de5\u4f5c\u8d1f\u8f7d\u4e0b\u7ec4\u4ef6\u5229\u7528\u4e0d\u8db3\u3001\u8ba1\u7b97\u5355\u5143\u8ba1\u7b97\u80fd\u529b\u4f4e\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faCD-PIM\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u56db\u4e2a\u521b\u65b0\uff1a1\uff09\u9ad8\u5e26\u5bbd\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u6a21\u5f0f\uff08HBCEM\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6bb5\u5168\u5c40\u4f4d\u7ebf\u5c06\u6bcf\u4e2a\u5b58\u50a8\u4f53\u5206\u4e3a\u56db\u4e2a\u4f2a\u5b58\u50a8\u4f53\uff1b2\uff09\u4f4e\u6279\u6b21\u4ea4\u9519\u6a21\u5f0f\uff08LBIM\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u91cd\u53e0GEMV\u548cGEMM\u64cd\u4f5c\u63d0\u9ad8\u7ec4\u4ef6\u5229\u7528\u7387\uff1b3\uff09\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u5355\u5143\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u4ee5\u6d41\u6c34\u7ebf\u65b9\u5f0f\u4e32\u884c\u8f93\u5165\u6743\u91cd\u6570\u636e\uff1b4\uff09\u952e\u7f13\u5b58\u77e9\u9635\u91c7\u7528\u5217\u5411\u6620\u5c04\uff0c\u503c\u7f13\u5b58\u77e9\u9635\u91c7\u7528\u884c\u5411\u6620\u5c04\u3002", "result": "\u5728HBCEM\u6a21\u5f0f\u4e0b\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4GPU\u57fa\u7ebf\u548c\u6700\u5148\u8fdbPIM\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0cCD-PIM\u5728\u5355\u6279\u6b21\u5185\u5206\u522b\u5b9e\u73b011.42\u500d\u548c4.25\u500d\u7684\u5e73\u5747\u52a0\u901f\u3002\u5728\u4f4e\u6279\u6b21\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\uff0cLBIM\u76f8\u6bd4HBCEM\u5b9e\u73b01.12\u500d\u5e73\u5747\u52a0\u901f\u3002", "conclusion": "CD-PIM\u901a\u8fc7\u521b\u65b0\u7684\u67b6\u6784\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u8fb9\u7f18\u4f4e\u6279\u6b21LLM\u90e8\u7f72\u4e2d\u7684\u5185\u5b58\u5e26\u5bbd\u74f6\u9888\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86GEMV\u64cd\u4f5c\u7684\u6267\u884c\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}

While recent systems have decoupled the prefill and decode stages to improve throughput, they still rely on unified scheduling policies that fail to adapt to heterogeneous workload characteristics. We observe that prompt-length variations lead to distinct performance bottlenecks, motivating an adaptive scheduling strategy. PLA-Serve disaggregates multi-turn long-prefill requests from short-prefill ones and introduces a length-aware smart batching mechanism for short-prefill workloads. It adopts a dual-queue design that supports temporal disaggregation on a single prefill instance or spatial disaggregation across multiple instances. For short-prefill batches, a batch waiting window and CUDA Graph-based clustering mitigate interference from heterogeneous computation, reducing batching delay and lowering average latency. In real multi-turn workloads, PLA-Serve reduces prefill latency by over 30% compared to vanilla SGLang under prefill**--**decode disaggregation, and further decreases SLO violations by 28% in multi-instance deployments with vanilla data-parallel configuration. Compared to the SGLang router with load balancing, it further lowers SLO violations by 12% in multi-GPU settings.

However, policy gradient methods such as PPO suffer from high variance gradient estimates, requiring careful hyperparameter tuning and extensive computational resources. We introduce GRADE (Gumbel-softmax Relaxation for Alignment via Differentiable Estimation), a method that replaces high-variance policy gradient estimation with direct backpropagation through a differentiable relaxation of the discrete token sampling process. Using the Gumbel-Softmax reparameterization with straight-through estimation (GRADE-STE), we enable end-to-end gradient flow from reward signals through generated tokens to model parameters. On sentiment-controlled text generation using the IMDB dataset, GRADE-STE achieves a test reward of 0.763 +- 0.344 compared to PPO's 0.510 +- 0.313 and REINFORCE's 0.617 +- 0.378, representing a 50% relative improvement over PPO. Critically, GRADE-STE exhibits gradient variance over 14 times lower than REINFORCE and maintains stable training dynamics throughout optimization. Our rigorous evaluation with proper train/validation/test splits demonstrates that these improvements generalize to held-out data, with GRADE-STE showing the best generalization characteristics among all methods tested.

Each class presents distinct electrical characteristics, but data centers are drawing particular attention as AI deployment drives unprecedented capacity growth. Their scale, duty cycles, and converter-dominated interfaces introduce new challenges for transmission interconnections, especially regarding disturbance behavior, steady-state performance, and operational visibility. This paper reviews best practices for large-load interconnections across North America, synthesizing utility and system operator guidelines into a coherent set of technical requirements.

However, existing multimodal inference systems typically employ monolithic architectures that tightly couple the Encode, Prefill, and Decode stages on homogeneous hardware, neglecting the heterogeneous computational characteristics of each stage. This design leads to inefficient resource utilization and limited system throughput. To address these issues, we propose EPD-Serve, a stage-level disaggregated inference serving system for multimodal models. EPD-Serve decouples the inference pipeline into independent Encode, Prefill, and Decode stages, enabling logical isolation and flexible co-located deployment through dynamic orchestration. Leveraging the Ascend interconnect topology, EPD-Serve introduces asynchronous feature prefetching between Encode and Prefill stages and a hierarchical grouped KV cache transmission mechanism between Prefill and Decode stages to improve cross-node communication efficiency. In addition, EPD-Serve incorporates multi-route scheduling, instance-level load balancing, and multi-stage hardware co-location with spatial multiplexing to better support diverse multimodal workloads. Comprehensive experiments on multimodal understanding models demonstrate that, under high-concurrency scenarios, EPD-Serve improves end-to-end throughput by 57.37-69.48% compared to PD-disaggregated deployment, while satisfying strict SLO constraints, including TTFT below 2000 ms and TPOT below 50 ms.

We introduce Hindsight Preference Replay (HPR), a simple and general replay augmentation strategy that retroactively relabels stored transitions with alternative preferences. This densifies supervision across the preference simplex without altering the CAPQL architecture or loss functions. Evaluated on six MO-Gymnasium locomotion tasks at a fixed 300000-step budget using expected utility (EUM), hypervolume (HV), and sparsity, HPR-CAPQL improves HV in five of six environments and EUM in four of six. On mo-humanoid-v5, for instance, EUM rises from $323\\!\\pm\\!125$ to $1613\\!\\pm\\!464$ and HV from 0.52M to 9.63M, with strong statistical support. mo-halfcheetah-v5 remains a challenging exception where CAPQL attains higher HV at comparable EUM.

The most common implementation of MCP, proposed by Anthropic, heavily relies on a Large Language Model (LLM) to decompose tasks and issue instructions to servers, which act as stateless executors. In particular, the agents, models, and servers are stateless and do not have access to a global context. However, in tasks involving LLM-driven coordination, it is natural that a Shared Context Store (SCS) could improve the efficiency and coherence of multi-agent workflows by reducing redundancy and enabling knowledge transfer between servers. Thus, in this work, we design and assess the performance of a Context-Aware MCP (CA-MCP) that offloads execution logic to specialized MCP servers that read from and write to a shared context memory, allowing them to coordinate more autonomously in real time. In this design, context management serves as the central mechanism that maintains continuity across task executions by tracking intermediate states and shared variables, thereby enabling persistent collaboration among agents without repeated prompting. We present experiments showing that the CA-MCP can outperform the traditional MCP by reducing the number of LLM calls required for complex tasks and decreasing the frequency of response failures when task conditions are not satisfied, thereby improving overall efficiency and responsiveness. In particular, we conducted experiments on the TravelPlanner and REALM-Bench benchmark datasets and observed statistically significant results indicating the potential advantages of incorporating a shared context store via CA-MCP in LLM-driven multi-agent systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "CA-MCP\u5728\u4f20\u7edfMCP\u57fa\u7840\u4e0a\u5f15\u5165\u5171\u4eab\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5b58\u50a8\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u51cf\u5c11LLM\u8c03\u7528\u6b21\u6570\u548c\u54cd\u5e94\u5931\u8d25\u7387\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6548\u7387\u548c\u534f\u4f5c\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edfMCP\u6846\u67b6\u4e2d\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u3001\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u90fd\u662f\u65e0\u72b6\u6001\u7684\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5168\u5c40\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u534f\u4f5c\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u5197\u4f59\u548c\u77e5\u8bc6\u4f20\u9012\u56f0\u96be\u3002\u5728\u9700\u8981LLM\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u534f\u8c03\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0c\u5171\u4eab\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5b58\u50a8\u53ef\u4ee5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7684\u6548\u7387\u548c\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u611f\u77e5\u7684MCP\uff08CA-MCP\uff09\uff0c\u5c06\u6267\u884c\u903b\u8f91\u5378\u8f7d\u5230\u4e13\u95e8\u7684MCP\u670d\u52a1\u5668\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u80fd\u591f\u8bfb\u5199\u5171\u4eab\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5185\u5b58\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5b9e\u65f6\u81ea\u4e3b\u534f\u8c03\u3002\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7ba1\u7406\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6838\u5fc3\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8ddf\u8e2a\u4e2d\u95f4\u72b6\u6001\u548c\u5171\u4eab\u53d8\u91cf\u6765\u7ef4\u6301\u4efb\u52a1\u6267\u884c\u7684\u8fde\u7eed\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728TravelPlanner\u548cREALM-Bench\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cCA-MCP\u76f8\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edfMCP\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u590d\u6742\u4efb\u52a1\u6240\u9700\u7684LLM\u8c03\u7528\u6b21\u6570\uff0c\u964d\u4f4e\u4efb\u52a1\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0d\u6ee1\u8db3\u65f6\u7684\u54cd\u5e94\u5931\u8d25\u9891\u7387\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63d0\u5347\u6574\u4f53\u6548\u7387\u548c\u54cd\u5e94\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7CA-MCP\u5f15\u5165\u5171\u4eab\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5b58\u50a8\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5728LLM\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u66f4\u8fde\u8d2f\u7684\u534f\u4f5c\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u5197\u4f59\u5e76\u4fc3\u8fdb\u77e5\u8bc6\u4f20\u9012\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

State-of-the-art predictors generally perform very well but occasionally suffer from high Misprediction Per Kilo Instruction due to hard-to-predict branches. In this work, we investigate if predicting branches using microarchitectural information, in addition to traditional branch history, can improve prediction accuracy. Our approach considers branch timing information (resolution cycle) both for older branches in the Reorder Buffer (ROB) and recently committed, and for younger branches relative to the branch we re-predict. We propose Speculative Branch Resolution (SBR) in which, N cycles after a branch allocates in the ROB, various timing information is collected and used to re-predict. Using the gem5 simulator we implement and perform a limit-study of SBR using a TAGE-Like predictor. Our experiments show that the post-alloc timing information we used was not able to yield performance gains over an unbounded TAGE-SC. However, we find two hard to predict branches where timing information did provide an advantage and thoroughly analysed one of them to understand why. This finding suggests that predictors may benefit from specific microarchitectural information to increase accuracy on specific hard to predict branches and that overriding predictions in the backend may yet yield performance benefits, but that further research is needed to determine such information vectors.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u7d22\u4f7f\u7528\u5fae\u67b6\u6784\u4fe1\u606f\uff08\u5206\u652f\u65f6\u5e8f\uff09\u8f85\u52a9\u4f20\u7edf\u5206\u652f\u5386\u53f2\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u63d0\u51faSBR\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f46\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u5bf9\u6574\u4f53\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u4ec5\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u96be\u9884\u6d4b\u5206\u652f\u4e0a\u6709\u6548\u3002", "motivation": "\u5206\u652f\u9884\u6d4b\u9519\u8bef\u662f\u73b0\u4ee3\u5904\u7406\u5668\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u548c\u80fd\u8017\u6d6a\u8d39\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u539f\u56e0\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u9884\u6d4b\u5668\u867d\u7136\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u96be\u9884\u6d4b\u5206\u652f\u4e0a\u4ecd\u6709\u8f83\u9ad8\u8bef\u9884\u6d4b\u7387\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u7d22\u662f\u5426\u53ef\u4ee5\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u5fae\u67b6\u6784\u4fe1\u606f\uff08\u9664\u4f20\u7edf\u5206\u652f\u5386\u53f2\u5916\uff09\u6765\u63d0\u9ad8\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faSpeculative Branch Resolution (SBR)\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a\u5728\u5206\u652f\u5206\u914d\u5230ROB\u540eN\u4e2a\u5468\u671f\uff0c\u6536\u96c6\u5404\u79cd\u65f6\u5e8f\u4fe1\u606f\uff08\u5305\u62ecROB\u4e2d\u8f83\u8001\u5206\u652f\u3001\u5df2\u63d0\u4ea4\u5206\u652f\u4ee5\u53ca\u76f8\u5bf9\u4e8e\u5f53\u524d\u9884\u6d4b\u5206\u652f\u7684\u8f83\u65b0\u5206\u652f\u7684\u5206\u652f\u65f6\u5e8f\u4fe1\u606f\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u8fd9\u4e9b\u4fe1\u606f\u91cd\u65b0\u8fdb\u884c\u9884\u6d4b\u3002\u4f7f\u7528gem5\u6a21\u62df\u5668\u5b9e\u73b0SBR\uff0c\u5e76\u57fa\u4e8eTAGE-Like\u9884\u6d4b\u5668\u8fdb\u884c\u6781\u9650\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u6240\u4f7f\u7528\u7684\u5206\u914d\u540e\u65f6\u5e8f\u4fe1\u606f\u672a\u80fd\u5e26\u6765\u8d85\u8d8a\u65e0\u9650\u5236TAGE-SC\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u589e\u76ca\u3002\u4f46\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u96be\u9884\u6d4b\u5206\u652f\u4e0a\uff0c\u65f6\u5e8f\u4fe1\u606f\u786e\u5b9e\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u5e76\u6df1\u5165\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u5176\u4e2d\u4e00\u4e2a\u6848\u4f8b\u4ee5\u7406\u89e3\u539f\u56e0\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9884\u6d4b\u5668\u53ef\u80fd\u53d7\u76ca\u4e8e\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u5fae\u67b6\u6784\u4fe1\u606f\u6765\u63d0\u9ad8\u7279\u5b9a\u96be\u9884\u6d4b\u5206\u652f\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u540e\u7aef\u8986\u76d6\u9884\u6d4b\u53ef\u80fd\u5e26\u6765\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u4f46\u9700\u8981\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u7814\u7a76\u786e\u5b9a\u6709\u6548\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u5411\u91cf\u3002"}}

As a combinatorial optimization model for channel assignment, the radio labeling is recognized as an NP-hard problem. Therefore, converting the spectrum assignment problem into the radio labeling of graphs and studying the radio labeling of specific graph classes is of great significance. For $G$, a radio labeling $\\varphi: V(G) \\to \\{0, 1, 2, \\ldots\\}$ is required to satisfy $|\\varphi(u) - \\varphi(v)| \\geq \\text{diam}(G) + 1 -d_G(u, v)$, where ${diam(G)}$ and $d_G(u, v)$ are diameter and distance between $u$ and $v$. For a radio labeling $\\varphi$, its $\\text{span}$ is defined as the largest integer assigned by $\\varphi$ to the vertices of $G$; the radio labeling specifically denotes the labeling with the minimal span among possible radio labeling. The strong product is a crucial tool for constructing regular networks, and studying its radio labeling is necessary for the design of optimal channel assignment in wireless networks. Within this manuscript, we discuss the radio labeling of strong prismatic network with star, present the relevant theorems and examples, and propose a parallel algorithm to improve computational efficiency in large-scale network scenarios.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u661f\u5f62\u5f3a\u68f1\u67f1\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u65e0\u7ebf\u9891\u8c31\u5206\u914d\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u56fe\u8bba\u4e2d\u7684\u65e0\u7ebf\u7535\u6807\u53f7\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u76f8\u5173\u5b9a\u7406\u3001\u793a\u4f8b\u548c\u5e76\u884c\u7b97\u6cd5\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u7f51\u7edc\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u65e0\u7ebf\u901a\u4fe1\u5feb\u901f\u53d1\u5c55\u4f7f\u5f97\u9ad8\u6548\u9891\u8c31\u5206\u914d\u6210\u4e3a\u63d0\u5347\u7f51\u7edc\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5173\u952e\u56e0\u7d20\u3002\u65e0\u7ebf\u7535\u6807\u53f7\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4fe1\u9053\u5206\u914d\u7684\u7ec4\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u6a21\u578b\u662fNP\u96be\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u7279\u5b9a\u56fe\u7c7b\u7684\u65e0\u7ebf\u7535\u6807\u53f7\u5bf9\u65e0\u7ebf\u7f51\u7edc\u6700\u4f18\u4fe1\u9053\u5206\u914d\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u9891\u8c31\u5206\u914d\u95ee\u9898\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u56fe\u7684\u65e0\u7ebf\u7535\u6807\u53f7\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u661f\u5f62\u5f3a\u68f1\u67f1\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u65e0\u7ebf\u7535\u6807\u53f7\u3002\u63d0\u51fa\u76f8\u5173\u5b9a\u7406\u548c\u793a\u4f8b\uff0c\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5e76\u884c\u7b97\u6cd5\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u7f51\u7edc\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u3002", "result": "\u8ba8\u8bba\u4e86\u661f\u5f62\u5f3a\u68f1\u67f1\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u65e0\u7ebf\u7535\u6807\u53f7\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u76f8\u5173\u5b9a\u7406\u548c\u793a\u4f8b\uff0c\u5e76\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u5e76\u884c\u7b97\u6cd5\u6765\u63d0\u5347\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f3a\u79ef\u662f\u6784\u5efa\u89c4\u5219\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u5176\u65e0\u7ebf\u7535\u6807\u53f7\u5bf9\u65e0\u7ebf\u7f51\u7edc\u6700\u4f18\u4fe1\u9053\u5206\u914d\u8bbe\u8ba1\u662f\u5fc5\u8981\u7684\u3002\u672c\u6587\u7684\u5de5\u4f5c\u4e3a\u661f\u5f62\u5f3a\u68f1\u67f1\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u9891\u8c31\u5206\u914d\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u652f\u6301\u548c\u9ad8\u6548\u8ba1\u7b97\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

Using ubiquitous sensors such as Passive InfraRed sensors (PIR) and door sensors is drawing increasing interest for monitoring daily activities and facilitating preventative healthcare interventions for the elderly. Human Activity Recognition (HAR) from passive sensors mostly relies on traditional machine learning and includes data segmentation, feature extraction, and classification. While techniques like Sensor Weighting Mutual Information (SWMI) capture spatial context in a feature vector, effectively leveraging temporal information remains a challenge. We tackle this by clustering activities into morning, afternoon, and night, and encoding them into the feature weighting method calculating distinct mutual information matrices. We further propose to extend the feature vector by incorporating time of day and day of week as cyclical temporal features, as well as adding a feature to track the user's location. The experiments show improved accuracy and F1-score over existing state-of-the-art methods in three out of four real-world datasets, with highest gains in a low-data regime. These results highlight the potential of our approach for developing effective smart home solutions to support ageing in place.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408\u65f6\u95f4\u805a\u7c7b\u548c\u5faa\u73af\u65f6\u95f4\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u4eba\u4f53\u6d3b\u52a8\u8bc6\u522b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u667a\u80fd\u5bb6\u5c45\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u901a\u8fc7\u88ab\u52a8\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u76d1\u6d4b\u8001\u5e74\u4eba\u65e5\u5e38\u6d3b\u52a8\uff0c\u5728\u4f4e\u6570\u636e\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u8bc6\u522b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u5168\u7403\u4eba\u53e3\u8001\u9f84\u5316\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u8ba9\u8001\u5e74\u4eba\u80fd\u591f\u72ec\u7acb\u5b89\u5168\u5730\u5728\u5bb6\u4e2d\u751f\u6d3b\u3002\u4f7f\u7528\u88ab\u52a8\u7ea2\u5916\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u548c\u95e8\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u7b49\u666e\u904d\u5b58\u5728\u7684\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u6765\u76d1\u6d4b\u65e5\u5e38\u6d3b\u52a8\u5e76\u4fc3\u8fdb\u9884\u9632\u6027\u533b\u7597\u5e72\u9884\u53d8\u5f97\u8d8a\u6765\u8d8a\u91cd\u8981\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6709\u6548\u5229\u7528\u65f6\u95f4\u4fe1\u606f\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u6d3b\u52a8\u6309\u65e9\u6668\u3001\u4e0b\u5348\u548c\u665a\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u805a\u7c7b\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u8fd9\u4e9b\u65f6\u95f4\u4fe1\u606f\u7f16\u7801\u5230\u7279\u5f81\u52a0\u6743\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u4e92\u4fe1\u606f\u77e9\u9635\u3002\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u6269\u5c55\u7279\u5f81\u5411\u91cf\uff0c\u52a0\u5165\u4e00\u5929\u4e2d\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u548c\u4e00\u5468\u4e2d\u7684\u5929\u6570\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5faa\u73af\u65f6\u95f4\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u5e76\u6dfb\u52a0\u7528\u6237\u4f4d\u7f6e\u8ddf\u8e2a\u7279\u5f81\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u56db\u4e2a\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e2d\u7684\u4e09\u4e2a\u4e0a\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u548cF1\u5206\u6570\u90fd\u6709\u6240\u63d0\u9ad8\uff0c\u5728\u4f4e\u6570\u636e\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u83b7\u5f97\u6700\u9ad8\u589e\u76ca\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5f00\u53d1\u6709\u6548\u667a\u80fd\u5bb6\u5c45\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u4ee5\u652f\u6301\u8001\u5e74\u4eba\u5c45\u5bb6\u517b\u8001\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u5229\u7528\u65f6\u95f4\u4fe1\u606f\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u4eba\u4f53\u6d3b\u52a8\u8bc6\u522b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

We prove that the sets of linearizable objects satisfying wait-freedom (resp., lock-freedom or obstruction-freedom) form a bounded join-semilattice under the forward simulation relation, and that the sets of linearizable objects without liveness constraints form a bounded lattice under the same relation. As part of our lattice result, we propose an equivalent characterization of linearizability by reducing checking linearizability w.r.t. sequential specification $Spec$ into checking forward simulation by an object $\\mathcal{U}_{Spec}$. To demonstrate the forward simulation relation between linearizable objects, we prove that the objects that are strongly linearizable w.r.t. the same sequential specification and are wait-free (resp., lock-free, obstruction-free) simulate each other, and we prove that the time-stamped queue simulates the Herlihy-Wing queue. We also prove that the Herlihy-Wing queue is simulated by $\\mathcal{U}_{Spec}$, and thus, our equivalent characterization of linearizability can be used in the verification of linearizability.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u7cfb\u7edf\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u7ebf\u6027\u5316\u5bf9\u8c61\u4e0e\u5411\u524d\u6a21\u62df\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u6d3b\u6027\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b\u7ebf\u6027\u5316\u5bf9\u8c61\u96c6\u5408\u6784\u6210\u6709\u754c\u534a\u683c\u6216\u683c\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u7ebf\u6027\u5316\u7684\u7b49\u4ef7\u7279\u5f81\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u7ebf\u6027\u5316\u5bf9\u8c61\u4e0e\u5411\u524d\u6a21\u62df\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u8054\u7cfb\uff0c\u4e3a\u5e76\u53d1\u5bf9\u8c61\u7684\u9a8c\u8bc1\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b0\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u548c\u5de5\u5177\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6570\u5b66\u8bc1\u660e\u5efa\u7acb\u7ebf\u6027\u5316\u5bf9\u8c61\u96c6\u5408\u5728\u5411\u524d\u6a21\u62df\u5173\u7cfb\u4e0b\u7684\u683c\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u8c61$\\mathcal{U}_{Spec}$\u5c06\u7ebf\u6027\u5316\u68c0\u67e5\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u5411\u524d\u6a21\u62df\u68c0\u67e5\u7684\u7b49\u4ef7\u7279\u5f81\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u6d3b\u6027\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b\u7684\u7ebf\u6027\u5316\u5bf9\u8c61\u96c6\u5408\u6784\u6210\u6709\u754c\u534a\u683c\u6216\u683c\uff1b\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5f3a\u7ebf\u6027\u5316\u5bf9\u8c61\u4e4b\u95f4\u76f8\u4e92\u6a21\u62df\uff1b\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u65f6\u95f4\u6233\u961f\u5217\u6a21\u62dfHerlihy-Wing\u961f\u5217\uff1b\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86Herlihy-Wing\u961f\u5217\u88ab$\\mathcal{U}_{Spec}$\u6a21\u62df\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7ebf\u6027\u5316\u4e0e\u5411\u524d\u6a21\u62df\u4e4b\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u6df1\u523b\u7684\u6570\u5b66\u7ed3\u6784\u8054\u7cfb\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u7b49\u4ef7\u7279\u5f81\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u7528\u4e8e\u7ebf\u6027\u5316\u7684\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u4e3a\u5e76\u53d1\u5bf9\u8c61\u9a8c\u8bc1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

Thus, patients require lifelong insulin therapy, which has a side effect of hypoglycemia. Hypoglycemia is a critical state of decreased blood glucose levels (BGL) below 70 mg/dL and is associated with increased risk of mortality. Machine learning (ML) models can improve diabetes management by predicting hypoglycemia and providing optimal prevention methods. ML models are classified into regression and classification based, that forecast glucose levels and identify events based on defined labels, respectively. This review investigates state-of-the-art models trained on data of continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) devices from patients with T1D. We compare the models' performance across short-term (15 to 120 min) and long term (3 to more than 24 hours) prediction horizons (PHs). Particularly, we explore: 1) How much in advance can glucose values or a hypoglycemic event be accurately predicted? 2) Which models have the best performance? 3) Which factors impact the performance? and 4) Does personalization increase performance? The results show that 1) a PH of up to 1 hour provides the best results. 2) Conventional ML methods yield the best results for classification and DL for regression. A single model cannot adequately classify across multiple PHs. 3) The model performance is influenced by multivariate datasets and the input sequence length (ISL). 4) Personal data enhances performance but due to limited data quality population-based models are preferred.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7efc\u8ff0\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u8fde\u7eed\u8840\u7cd6\u76d1\u6d4b\u6570\u636e\u7684\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u57281\u578b\u7cd6\u5c3f\u75c5\u4f4e\u8840\u7cd6\u9884\u6d4b\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u9884\u6d4b\u65f6\u95f4\u7a97\u53e3\u4e0b\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u53d1\u73b01\u5c0f\u65f6\u5185\u7684\u77ed\u671f\u9884\u6d4b\u6548\u679c\u6700\u4f73\uff0c\u4f20\u7edfML\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u597d\uff0c\u800c\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u56de\u5f52\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u66f4\u4f18\u3002", "motivation": "1\u578b\u7cd6\u5c3f\u75c5\u60a3\u8005\u9700\u8981\u7ec8\u8eab\u80f0\u5c9b\u7d20\u6cbb\u7597\uff0c\u4f46\u80f0\u5c9b\u7d20\u6cbb\u7597\u6709\u5bfc\u81f4\u4f4e\u8840\u7cd6\u7684\u526f\u4f5c\u7528\u3002\u4f4e\u8840\u7cd6\uff08\u8840\u7cd6\u4f4e\u4e8e70 mg/dL\uff09\u4f1a\u589e\u52a0\u6b7b\u4ea1\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u51c6\u786e\u9884\u6d4b\u4f4e\u8840\u7cd6\u4e8b\u4ef6\u4ee5\u6539\u5584\u7cd6\u5c3f\u75c5\u7ba1\u7406\u3002", "method": "\u7efc\u8ff0\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u8fde\u7eed\u8840\u7cd6\u76d1\u6d4b\u6570\u636e\u7684\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u56de\u5f52\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u9884\u6d4b\u8840\u7cd6\u6c34\u5e73\uff09\u548c\u5206\u7c7b\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u8bc6\u522b\u4f4e\u8840\u7cd6\u4e8b\u4ef6\uff09\u3002\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86\u77ed\u671f\uff0815-120\u5206\u949f\uff09\u548c\u957f\u671f\uff083-24\u5c0f\u65f6\u4ee5\u4e0a\uff09\u9884\u6d4b\u65f6\u95f4\u7a97\u53e3\u4e0b\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u56db\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u95ee\u9898\uff1a\u9884\u6d4b\u65f6\u95f4\u7a97\u53e3\u3001\u6700\u4f73\u6a21\u578b\u7c7b\u578b\u3001\u5f71\u54cd\u56e0\u7d20\u4ee5\u53ca\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6548\u679c\u3002", "result": "1) 1\u5c0f\u65f6\u5185\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u65f6\u95f4\u7a97\u53e3\u6548\u679c\u6700\u4f73\uff1b2) \u4f20\u7edf\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u597d\uff0c\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u56de\u5f52\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u66f4\u4f18\uff0c\u5355\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u6cd5\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u9884\u6d4b\u65f6\u95f4\u7a97\u53e3\u4e0a\u90fd\u6709\u826f\u597d\u8868\u73b0\uff1b3) \u591a\u53d8\u91cf\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u8f93\u5165\u5e8f\u5217\u957f\u5ea6\u5f71\u54cd\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\uff1b4) \u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u6570\u636e\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4f46\u7531\u4e8e\u6570\u636e\u8d28\u91cf\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u4eba\u7fa4\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u66f4\u53d7\u9752\u7750\u3002", "conclusion": "\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u9884\u6d4b1\u578b\u7cd6\u5c3f\u75c5\u60a3\u8005\u7684\u4f4e\u8840\u7cd6\u4e8b\u4ef6\uff0c\u77ed\u671f\u9884\u6d4b\uff081\u5c0f\u65f6\u5185\uff09\u6548\u679c\u6700\u4f73\u3002\u6a21\u578b\u9009\u62e9\u5e94\u6839\u636e\u5177\u4f53\u4efb\u52a1\uff08\u5206\u7c7b\u6216\u56de\u5f52\uff09\u800c\u5b9a\uff0c\u4e14\u9700\u8981\u8003\u8651\u591a\u53d8\u91cf\u6570\u636e\u548c\u8f93\u5165\u5e8f\u5217\u957f\u5ea6\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u867d\u7136\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u6a21\u578b\u6709\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u76ee\u524d\u57fa\u4e8e\u4eba\u7fa4\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u66f4\u4e3a\u53ef\u884c\u3002"}}

Accepted by ASPLOS 2026", "summary": "Embodied Artificial Intelligence (AI) has recently attracted significant attention as it bridges AI with the physical world. Modern embodied AI systems often combine a Large Language Model (LLM)-based planner for high-level task planning and a reinforcement learning (RL)-based controller for low-level action generation, enabling embodied agents to tackle complex tasks in real-world environments. However, deploying embodied agents remains challenging due to their high computation requirements, especially for battery-powered local devices. Although techniques like lowering operating voltage can improve energy efficiency, they can introduce bit errors and result in task failures. In this work, we propose CREATE, a general design principle that leverages heterogeneous resilience at different layers for synergistic energy-reliability co-optimization. For the first time, we conduct a comprehensive error injection study on modern embodied AI systems and observe an inherent but heterogeneous fault tolerance. Building upon these insights, we develop an anomaly detection and clearance mechanism at the circuit level to eliminate outlier errors. At the model level, we propose a weight-rotation-enhanced planning algorithm to improve the fault tolerance of the LLM-based planner. Furthermore, we introduce an application-level technique, autonomy-adaptive voltage scaling, to dynamically adjust the operating voltage of the controllers. The voltage scaling circuit is co-designed to enable online voltage adjustment. Extensive experiments demonstrate that without compromising task quality, CREATE achieves 40.6% computational energy savings on average over nominal-voltage baselines and 35.0% over prior-art techniques. This further leads to 29.5% to 37.3% chip-level energy savings and approximately a 15% to 30% improvement in battery life.", "AI": {"tldr": "CREATE\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5f02\u6784\u5f39\u6027\u8bbe\u8ba1\u539f\u5219\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u7535\u8def\u5c42\u3001\u6a21\u578b\u5c42\u548c\u5e94\u7528\u5c42\u534f\u540c\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5177\u8eabAI\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u80fd\u6548\u4e0e\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u534f\u540c\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u5e73\u5747\u8282\u770140.6%\u8ba1\u7b97\u80fd\u8017\u3002", "motivation": "\u5177\u8eabAI\u7cfb\u7edf\u7ed3\u5408LLM\u89c4\u5212\u5668\u548cRL\u63a7\u5236\u5668\uff0c\u4f46\u90e8\u7f72\u5728\u7535\u6c60\u4f9b\u7535\u8bbe\u5907\u4e0a\u9762\u4e34\u9ad8\u8ba1\u7b97\u80fd\u8017\u6311\u6218\u3002\u964d\u4f4e\u5de5\u4f5c\u7535\u538b\u53ef\u63d0\u5347\u80fd\u6548\uff0c\u4f46\u4f1a\u5f15\u5165\u6bd4\u7279\u9519\u8bef\u5bfc\u81f4\u4efb\u52a1\u5931\u8d25\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u89e3\u51b3\u80fd\u6548\u4e0e\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u7684\u6743\u8861\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "1) \u5bf9\u73b0\u4ee3\u5177\u8eabAI\u7cfb\u7edf\u8fdb\u884c\u5168\u9762\u9519\u8bef\u6ce8\u5165\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5f02\u6784\u5bb9\u9519\u7279\u6027\uff1b2) \u7535\u8def\u5c42\uff1a\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e0e\u6e05\u9664\u673a\u5236\u6d88\u9664\u5f02\u5e38\u9519\u8bef\uff1b3) \u6a21\u578b\u5c42\uff1a\u6743\u91cd\u65cb\u8f6c\u589e\u5f3a\u89c4\u5212\u7b97\u6cd5\u63d0\u5347LLM\u89c4\u5212\u5668\u5bb9\u9519\u6027\uff1b4) \u5e94\u7528\u5c42\uff1a\u81ea\u4e3b\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u7535\u538b\u7f29\u653e\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u5de5\u4f5c\u7535\u538b\uff1b5) \u534f\u540c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7535\u538b\u7f29\u653e\u7535\u8def\u652f\u6301\u5728\u7ebf\u7535\u538b\u8c03\u6574\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e0d\u5f71\u54cd\u4efb\u52a1\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\uff0cCREATE\u76f8\u6bd4\u6807\u79f0\u7535\u538b\u57fa\u7ebf\u5e73\u5747\u8282\u770140.6%\u8ba1\u7b97\u80fd\u8017\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u6280\u672f\u8282\u770135.0%\u3002\u82af\u7247\u7ea7\u80fd\u8017\u8282\u770129.5%-37.3%\uff0c\u7535\u6c60\u5bff\u547d\u63d0\u5347\u7ea615%-30%\u3002", "conclusion": "CREATE\u901a\u8fc7\u8de8\u5c42\u5f02\u6784\u5f39\u6027\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u5b9e\u73b0\u5177\u8eabAI\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u80fd\u6548\u4e0e\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u534f\u540c\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u4e3a\u7535\u6c60\u4f9b\u7535\u8bbe\u5907\u4e0a\u7684\u5177\u8eabAI\u90e8\u7f72\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

However, the resulting exponential growth in computation workload is placing significant strain on data centers, while edge devices remain largely underutilized, leading to imbalanced workloads and resource inefficiency across the network. Integrating edge devices into the LLM inference process via speculative decoding helps balance the workload between the edge and the cloud, while maintaining lossless prediction accuracy. In this paper, we identify and formalize two critical bottlenecks that limit the efficiency and scalability of distributed speculative LLM serving: Wasted Drafting Time and Verification Interference. To address these challenges, we propose WISP, an efficient and SLO-aware distributed LLM inference system that consists of an intelligent speculation controller, a verification time estimator, and a verification batch scheduler. These components collaboratively enhance drafting efficiency and optimize verification request scheduling on the server. Extensive numerical results show that WISP improves system capacity by up to 2.1x and 4.1x, and increases system goodput by up to 1.94x and 3.7x, compared to centralized serving and SLED, respectively.", "AI": {"tldr": "WISP\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u5f0fLLM\u63a8\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u667a\u80fd\u63a8\u6d4b\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u3001\u9a8c\u8bc1\u65f6\u95f4\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\u548c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6279\u8c03\u5ea6\u5668\u89e3\u51b3\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u63a8\u6d4b\u89e3\u7801\u4e2d\u7684\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u7cfb\u7edf\u5bb9\u91cf\u548c\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740LLM\u5728\u8fb9\u7f18\u8bbe\u5907\u7684\u666e\u53ca\uff0c\u5927\u91cf\u63a8\u7406\u8bf7\u6c42\u96c6\u4e2d\u5728\u4e2d\u5fc3GPU\u96c6\u7fa4\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u5fc3\u538b\u529b\u5de8\u5927\u800c\u8fb9\u7f18\u8bbe\u5907\u5229\u7528\u7387\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u9020\u6210\u7f51\u7edc\u8d44\u6e90\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u548c\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u4e0b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faWISP\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u4e09\u4e2a\u6838\u5fc3\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff1a\u667a\u80fd\u63a8\u6d4b\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u4f18\u5316\u8349\u7a3f\u751f\u6210\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u65f6\u95f4\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\u9884\u6d4b\u9a8c\u8bc1\u65f6\u95f4\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6279\u8c03\u5ea6\u5668\u4f18\u5316\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u4e0a\u7684\u9a8c\u8bc1\u8bf7\u6c42\u8c03\u5ea6\uff0c\u5171\u540c\u89e3\u51b3\"\u6d6a\u8d39\u7684\u8349\u7a3f\u65f6\u95f4\"\u548c\"\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5e72\u6270\"\u4e24\u4e2a\u74f6\u9888\u3002", "result": "\u76f8\u6bd4\u96c6\u4e2d\u5f0f\u670d\u52a1\u548cSLED\uff0cWISP\u5c06\u7cfb\u7edf\u5bb9\u91cf\u5206\u522b\u63d0\u5347\u81f32.1\u500d\u548c4.1\u500d\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u5206\u522b\u63d0\u5347\u81f31.94\u500d\u548c3.7\u500d\u3002", "conclusion": "WISP\u901a\u8fc7\u6709\u6548\u6574\u5408\u8fb9\u7f18\u8bbe\u5907\u5230LLM\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u63a8\u6d4b\u89e3\u7801\u7684\u5173\u952e\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u7684SLO\u611f\u77e5\u5206\u5e03\u5f0fLLM\u63a8\u7406\u670d\u52a1\u3002"}}

In this work, we study MoEs through a geometric lens, interpreting routing as a form of soft partitioning of the representation space into overlapping local charts. We introduce a Dual Jacobian-PCA Spectral Geometry probe. It analyzes local function geometry via Jacobian singular-value spectra and representation geometry via weighted PCA of routed hidden states. Using a controlled MLP-MoE setting that permits exact Jacobian computation, we compare dense, Top-k, and fully-soft routing architectures under matched capacity. Across random seeds, we observe that MoE routing consistently reduces local sensitivity, with expert-local Jacobians exhibiting smaller leading singular values and faster spectral decay than dense baselines. At the same time, weighted PCA reveals that expert-local representations distribute variance across a larger number of principal directions, indicating higher effective rank under identical input distributions. We further find that average expert Jacobians are nearly orthogonal, suggesting a decomposition of the transformation into low-overlap expert-specific subspaces rather than scaled variants of a shared map. We analyze how routing sharpness modulates these effects, showing that Top-k routing produces lower-rank, more concentrated expert-local structure, while fully-soft routing yields broader, higher-rank representations. Together, these results support a geometric interpretation of MoEs as soft partitionings of function space that flatten local curvature while redistributing representation variance.", "AI": {"tldr": "MoE\u67b6\u6784\u901a\u8fc7\u8def\u7531\u673a\u5236\u5c06\u8868\u793a\u7a7a\u95f4\u8f6f\u5212\u5206\u4e3a\u91cd\u53e0\u7684\u5c40\u90e8\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u5c40\u90e8\u654f\u611f\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u8868\u793a\u7684\u6709\u6548\u79e9\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u53d8\u6362\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u4e13\u5bb6\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u4f4e\u91cd\u53e0\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76MoE\u67b6\u6784\u5bf9\u5b66\u4e60\u51fd\u6570\u548c\u8868\u793a\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u7406\u89e3\u8def\u7531\u673a\u5236\u5982\u4f55\u5851\u9020\u51fd\u6570\u7a7a\u95f4\u548c\u8868\u793a\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u7279\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u53cc\u91cd\u96c5\u53ef\u6bd4-PCA\u8c31\u51e0\u4f55\u63a2\u9488\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u96c5\u53ef\u6bd4\u5947\u5f02\u503c\u8c31\u5206\u6790\u5c40\u90e8\u51fd\u6570\u51e0\u4f55\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u52a0\u6743PCA\u5206\u6790\u8def\u7531\u9690\u85cf\u72b6\u6001\u7684\u8868\u793a\u51e0\u4f55\u3002\u5728\u53ef\u63a7\u7684MLP-MoE\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e2d\u6bd4\u8f83\u5bc6\u96c6\u3001Top-k\u548c\u5168\u8f6f\u8def\u7531\u67b6\u6784\u3002", "result": "MoE\u8def\u7531\u4e00\u81f4\u964d\u4f4e\u5c40\u90e8\u654f\u611f\u6027\uff0c\u4e13\u5bb6\u5c40\u90e8\u96c5\u53ef\u6bd4\u77e9\u9635\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u5c0f\u7684\u4e3b\u5bfc\u5947\u5f02\u503c\u548c\u66f4\u5feb\u7684\u8c31\u8870\u51cf\u3002\u52a0\u6743PCA\u663e\u793a\u4e13\u5bb6\u5c40\u90e8\u8868\u793a\u5728\u66f4\u591a\u4e3b\u65b9\u5411\u4e0a\u5206\u5e03\u65b9\u5dee\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u5728\u76f8\u540c\u8f93\u5165\u5206\u5e03\u4e0b\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u6709\u6548\u79e9\u3002\u5e73\u5747\u4e13\u5bb6\u96c5\u53ef\u6bd4\u77e9\u9635\u63a5\u8fd1\u6b63\u4ea4\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u53d8\u6362\u88ab\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u4f4e\u91cd\u53e0\u7684\u4e13\u5bb6\u7279\u5b9a\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u3002", "conclusion": "MoE\u53ef\u88ab\u51e0\u4f55\u89e3\u91ca\u4e3a\u51fd\u6570\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u8f6f\u5212\u5206\uff0c\u5b83\u5e73\u5766\u5316\u5c40\u90e8\u66f2\u7387\u540c\u65f6\u91cd\u65b0\u5206\u914d\u8868\u793a\u65b9\u5dee\u3002Top-k\u8def\u7531\u4ea7\u751f\u66f4\u4f4e\u79e9\u3001\u66f4\u96c6\u4e2d\u7684\u4e13\u5bb6\u5c40\u90e8\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u800c\u5168\u8f6f\u8def\u7531\u4ea7\u751f\u66f4\u5e7f\u6cdb\u3001\u66f4\u9ad8\u79e9\u7684\u8868\u793a\u3002"}}

However, it is critically challenged by the resource constraints of a single edge node. Distributed inference has emerged to aggregate and leverage computational resources across multiple devices. Yet, existing methods typically require strict synchronization, which is often infeasible due to the unreliable network conditions. In this paper, we propose HALO, a novel framework that can boost the distributed LLM inference in lossy edge network. The core idea is to enable a relaxed yet effective synchronization by strategically allocating less critical neuron groups to unstable devices, thus avoiding the excessive waiting time incurred by delayed packets. HALO introduces three key mechanisms: (1) a semantic-aware predictor to assess the significance of neuron groups prior to activation. (2) a parallel execution scheme of neuron group loading during the model inference. (3) a load-balancing scheduler that efficiently orchestrates multiple devices with heterogeneous resources. Experimental results from a Raspberry Pi cluster demonstrate that HALO achieves a 3.41x end-to-end speedup for LLaMA-series LLMs under unreliable network conditions. It maintains performance comparable to optimal conditions and significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art in various scenarios.", "AI": {"tldr": "HALO\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u7528\u4e8e\u8fb9\u7f18\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u5206\u5e03\u5f0fLLM\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u677e\u5f1b\u540c\u6b65\u548c\u667a\u80fd\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\u7ec4\u5206\u914d\u6765\u5e94\u5bf9\u4e0d\u53ef\u9760\u7f51\u7edc\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b03.41\u500d\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u52a0\u901f\u3002", "motivation": "\u8fb9\u7f18\u90e8\u7f72LLM\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u63d0\u9ad8\u54cd\u5e94\u901f\u5ea6\u5e76\u4fdd\u62a4\u9690\u79c1\uff0c\u4f46\u5355\u4e2a\u8fb9\u7f18\u8282\u70b9\u8d44\u6e90\u6709\u9650\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\u9700\u8981\u4e25\u683c\u540c\u6b65\uff0c\u8fd9\u5728\u4e0d\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u8fb9\u7f18\u7f51\u7edc\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u4e0d\u53ef\u884c\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faHALO\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1) \u8bed\u4e49\u611f\u77e5\u9884\u6d4b\u5668\u5728\u6fc0\u6d3b\u524d\u8bc4\u4f30\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\u7ec4\u91cd\u8981\u6027\uff1b2) \u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u671f\u95f4\u5e76\u884c\u6267\u884c\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\u7ec4\u52a0\u8f7d\uff1b3) \u8d1f\u8f7d\u5747\u8861\u8c03\u5ea6\u5668\u534f\u8c03\u5f02\u6784\u8bbe\u5907\u8d44\u6e90\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6811\u8393\u6d3e\u96c6\u7fa4\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cHALO\u5728\u4e0d\u53ef\u9760\u7f51\u7edc\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u4e3aLLaMA\u7cfb\u5217LLM\u5b9e\u73b03.41\u500d\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u52a0\u901f\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u63a5\u8fd1\u6700\u4f18\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "HALO\u901a\u8fc7\u677e\u5f1b\u540c\u6b65\u548c\u667a\u80fd\u8d44\u6e90\u5206\u914d\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u8fb9\u7f18\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u5206\u5e03\u5f0fLLM\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u4e3a\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u63a8\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Probe families induce an operational equivalence relation on kernels and therefore a gauge; anchors select representatives relative to that probe. Under a scalar relational-work representation and a multiplicative compositionality law for evidence, the admissible link family is exponential, yielding Gibbs weights; with row anchoring this includes the softmax kernel family as a subregime. After quotienting unary row/column score fields, the remaining interaction component admits a canonical rank-r normal form (Eckart-Young/SVD); dot-product score charts implement the corresponding low-rank interaction regime. Fixing the carrier and extensionalizing the update yields the standard fixed-token Transformer attention operator; allowing carrier updates yields adaptive-carrier and staged-depth regimes. The operator language also supports multihead/mixed kernels, plan-based anchors (e.g., entropic OT/Sinkhorn), and unary operators (e.g., FFN-style fields) as explicit regime choices.

One approach is to completely abandon the concept of CPU -- and thus serial imperative programming -- and instead to specify and execute tasks in parallel, compiling from programming languages to data flow digital logic. It is well-known that pure functional languages are inherently parallel, due to the Church-Rosser theorem, and CPU-based parallel compilers exist for many functional languages. However, these still rely on conventional CPUs and their von Neumann bottlenecks. An alternative is to compile functional languages directly into digital logic to maximize available parallelism. It is difficult to work with complete modern functional languages due to their many features, so we demonstrate a proof-of-concept system using lambda calculus as the source language and compiling to digital logic. We show how functional hardware can be tailored to a simplistic functional language, forming the ground for a new model of CPU-less functional computation. At the algorithmic level, we use a tree-based representation, with data localized within nodes and communicated data passed between them. This is implemented by physical digital logic blocks corresponding to nodes, and buses enabling message passing. Node types and behaviors correspond to lambda grammar forms, and beta-reductions are performed in parallel allowing branches independent from one another to perform transformations simultaneously. As evidence for this approach, we present an implementation, along with simulation results, showcasing successful execution of lambda expressions. This suggests that the approach could be scaled to larger functional languages. Successful execution of a test suite of lambda expressions suggests that the approach could be scaled to larger functional languages.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5c06\u7eaf\u51fd\u6570\u5f0f\u8bed\u8a00\u76f4\u63a5\u7f16\u8bd1\u4e3a\u6570\u5b57\u903b\u8f91\u7535\u8def\uff0c\u7ed5\u8fc7\u4f20\u7edfCPU\u548c\u51af\u00b7\u8bfa\u4f9d\u66fc\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5e76\u884c\u8ba1\u7b97", "motivation": "\u6676\u4f53\u7ba1\u5bc6\u5ea6\u6301\u7eed\u589e\u52a0\u4f46\u65f6\u949f\u901f\u5ea6\u505c\u6ede\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5bfb\u627e\u65b0\u7684\u5e76\u884c\u67b6\u6784\u3002\u4f20\u7edfCPU\u5b58\u5728\u51af\u00b7\u8bfa\u4f9d\u66fc\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u800c\u7eaf\u51fd\u6570\u5f0f\u8bed\u8a00\u5177\u6709\u5185\u5728\u5e76\u884c\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u7f16\u8bd1\u5668\u4ecd\u4f9d\u8d56\u4f20\u7edfCPU", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u03bb\u6f14\u7b97\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6e90\u8bed\u8a00\uff0c\u7f16\u8bd1\u4e3a\u6570\u5b57\u903b\u8f91\u7535\u8def\u3002\u91c7\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u6811\u7684\u8868\u793a\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8282\u70b9\u5bf9\u5e94\u03bb\u8bed\u6cd5\u5f62\u5f0f\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u603b\u7ebf\u8fdb\u884c\u6d88\u606f\u4f20\u9012\uff0c\u5e76\u884c\u6267\u884c\u03b2\u5f52\u7ea6", "result": "\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6982\u5ff5\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u62df\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u03bb\u8868\u8fbe\u5f0f\u7684\u6210\u529f\u6267\u884c\uff0c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5957\u4ef6\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u65e0CPU\u51fd\u6570\u5f0f\u8ba1\u7b97\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u6a21\u578b\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u66f4\u5927\u7684\u51fd\u6570\u5f0f\u8bed\u8a00\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u76f4\u63a5\u7f16\u8bd1\u51fd\u6570\u5f0f\u8bed\u8a00\u5230\u786c\u4ef6\u903b\u8f91\u7684\u6f5c\u529b"}}

A hybrid batch combines prefill and decode tokens of different requests in the same batch to improve resource utilization and throughput at the cost of increased latency per token. In contrast, disaggregated serving decouples compute-bound prefill and bandwidth-bound decode phases to optimize for service level objectives (SLOs) at the cost of resource under-utilization and KV-cache transfer overheads. To address the limitations of these techniques, we propose RAPID-Serve: a technique to concurrently execute prefill and decode on the same GPU(s) to meet latency SLOs while maintaining high throughput and efficient resource utilization. Furthermore, we propose Adaptive Resource Management for runtime compute resource allocation, optionally leveraging CU masking (a fine-grained Compute Unit partitioning feature on AMD Instinct\\textsuperscript{TM} GPUs).

As the models grow gigantic in terms of memory footprint, difficulties in fitting the model on a device like a GPU or an AI accelerator give rise to the need for multiple computing devices thereby escalating the computing cost. This increased training/inference cost paved the way for efficient model size reduction/parametric reduction deploying Sparse Attention techniques. In this paper, we start analyzing one of the techniques of Sparse Attention called Symmetric Dot-Product Attention (referred to as Symmetric Attention) and propose a novel unified model architecture called Noise Diffused Symmetric Attention Transformer to enhance the model's performance. While maintaining the memory gains of Symmetric Attention, with minute overhead in terms of model parameters and computational overhead, the proposed model brings in enhanced performance in terms of accuracy and inference-time sampling. The proposed model is validated upon GPT2 base model and the results reflect the performance gains falling between plain Symmetric attention and GPT2 base model on a variety of GLUE benchmark tasks in terms of accuracy, with significant model size reduction with respect to the base model.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u578b\u7684\u566a\u58f0\u6269\u6563\u5bf9\u79f0\u6ce8\u610f\u529bTransformer\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u5bf9\u79f0\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5185\u5b58\u4f18\u52bf\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5fae\u5c0f\u53c2\u6570\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5728GPT2\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5728GLUE\u57fa\u51c6\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u63d0\u5347\u548c\u663e\u8457\u6a21\u578b\u5927\u5c0f\u7f29\u51cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740Transformer\u6a21\u578b\u89c4\u6a21\u6025\u5267\u589e\u5927\uff0c\u5185\u5b58\u5360\u7528\u5bfc\u81f4\u96be\u4ee5\u5728\u5355\u8bbe\u5907\u4e0a\u90e8\u7f72\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u591a\u8bbe\u5907\u8ba1\u7b97\u4ece\u800c\u589e\u52a0\u6210\u672c\u3002\u7a00\u758f\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6280\u672f\u6210\u4e3a\u6a21\u578b\u538b\u7f29\u7684\u6709\u6548\u9014\u5f84\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u5bf9\u79f0\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6027\u80fd\u4e0a\u4ecd\u6709\u63d0\u5347\u7a7a\u95f4\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u566a\u58f0\u6269\u6563\u5bf9\u79f0\u6ce8\u610f\u529bTransformer\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u5728\u5bf9\u79f0\u70b9\u79ef\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u57fa\u7840\u4e0a\u5f15\u5165\u566a\u58f0\u6269\u6563\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u4fdd\u6301\u5bf9\u79f0\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u7684\u5185\u5b58\u4f18\u52bf\u540c\u65f6\u589e\u5f3a\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4ec5\u589e\u52a0\u5fae\u5c0f\u53c2\u6570\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u3002", "result": "\u5728GPT2\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2aGLUE\u57fa\u51c6\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\uff0c\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4ecb\u4e8e\u539f\u59cb\u5bf9\u79f0\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u548cGPT2\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u4e4b\u95f4\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u5927\u5c0f\u7f29\u51cf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u566a\u58f0\u6269\u6563\u5bf9\u79f0\u6ce8\u610f\u529bTransformer\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u5185\u5b58\u6548\u7387\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e3a\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6548\u7387\u4f18\u5316\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Code available at https://github.com/gogipav14/spectral-llm", "summary": "Learning precise Boolean logic via gradient descent remains challenging: neural networks typically converge to \"fuzzy\" approximations that degrade under quantization. We introduce Hierarchical Spectral Composition, a differentiable architecture that selects spectral coefficients from a frozen Boolean Fourier basis and composes them via Sinkhorn-constrained routing with column-sign modulation. Our approach draws on recent insights from Manifold-Constrained Hyper-Connections (mHC), which demonstrated that projecting routing matrices onto the Birkhoff polytope preserves identity mappings and stabilizes large-scale training. We adapt this framework to logic synthesis, adding column-sign modulation to enable Boolean negation -- a capability absent in standard doubly stochastic routing.\n  We validate our approach across four phases of increasing complexity: (1) For n=2 (16 Boolean operations over 4-dim basis), gradient descent achieves 100% accuracy with zero routing drift and zero-loss quantization to ternary masks. (2) For n=3 (10 three-variable operations), gradient descent achieves 76% accuracy, but exhaustive enumeration over 3^8 = 6561 configurations proves that optimal ternary masks exist for all operations (100% accuracy, 39% sparsity). (3) For n=4 (10 four-variable operations over 16-dim basis), spectral synthesis -- combining exact Walsh-Hadamard coefficients, ternary quantization, and MCMC refinement with parallel tempering -- achieves 100% accuracy on all operations. This progression establishes (a) that ternary polynomial threshold representations exist for all tested functions, and (b) that finding them requires methods beyond pure gradient descent as dimensionality grows. All operations enable single-cycle combinational logic inference at 10,959 MOps/s on GPU, demonstrating viability for hardware-efficient neuro-symbolic logic synthesis.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5206\u5c42\u8c31\u7ec4\u5408\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9009\u62e9\u5e03\u5c14\u5085\u91cc\u53f6\u57fa\u7684\u8c31\u7cfb\u6570\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408Sinkhorn\u7ea6\u675f\u8def\u7531\u548c\u5217\u7b26\u53f7\u8c03\u5236\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u7cbe\u786e\u5e03\u5c14\u903b\u8f91\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u786c\u4ef6\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u7b26\u53f7\u903b\u8f91\u5408\u6210\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u901a\u8fc7\u68af\u5ea6\u4e0b\u964d\u5b66\u4e60\u5e03\u5c14\u903b\u8f91\u65f6\uff0c\u901a\u5e38\u6536\u655b\u5230\"\u6a21\u7cca\"\u8fd1\u4f3c\uff0c\u5728\u91cf\u5316\u4e0b\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u591f\u5b66\u4e60\u7cbe\u786e\u5e03\u5c14\u903b\u8f91\u7684\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u786c\u4ef6\u9ad8\u6548\u5b9e\u73b0\u3002", "method": "\u5206\u5c42\u8c31\u7ec4\u5408\u67b6\u6784\uff1a\u4ece\u51bb\u7ed3\u7684\u5e03\u5c14\u5085\u91cc\u53f6\u57fa\u4e2d\u9009\u62e9\u8c31\u7cfb\u6570\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7Sinkhorn\u7ea6\u675f\u8def\u7531\u8fdb\u884c\u7ec4\u5408\uff0c\u5e76\u52a0\u5165\u5217\u7b26\u53f7\u8c03\u5236\u5b9e\u73b0\u5e03\u5c14\u5426\u5b9a\u3002\u57fa\u4e8e\u6d41\u5f62\u7ea6\u675f\u8d85\u8fde\u63a5\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u8def\u7531\u77e9\u9635\u6295\u5f71\u5230Birkhoff\u591a\u9762\u4f53\u4e0a\u3002", "result": "1) n=2\u65f6\uff0c\u68af\u5ea6\u4e0b\u964d\u8fbe\u5230100%\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff1b2) n=3\u65f6\uff0c\u68af\u5ea6\u4e0b\u964d76%\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u4f46\u679a\u4e3e\u8bc1\u660e\u5b58\u5728\u6700\u4f18\u4e09\u5143\u63a9\u7801(100%\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c39%\u7a00\u758f\u5ea6)\uff1b3) n=4\u65f6\uff0c\u8c31\u5408\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u8fbe\u5230100%\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3002GPU\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u5355\u5468\u671f\u7ec4\u5408\u903b\u8f91\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u901f\u5ea6\u8fbe10,959 MOps/s\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u6240\u6709\u6d4b\u8bd5\u51fd\u6570\u90fd\u5b58\u5728\u4e09\u5143\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u9608\u503c\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u4f46\u968f\u7740\u7ef4\u5ea6\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u8d85\u8d8a\u7eaf\u68af\u5ea6\u4e0b\u964d\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u652f\u6301\u786c\u4ef6\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u7b26\u53f7\u903b\u8f91\u5408\u6210\uff0c\u5728GPU\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u901f\u63a8\u7406\u3002"}}

However, rigorously quantifying how well a PINN captures the complete dynamical behavior of the system, beyond simple trajectory prediction, remains a challenge. This paper proposes a novel experimental framework to address this by employing Fisher information for differentiable dynamical systems, denoted $g_F^C$. This Fisher information, distinct from its statistical counterpart, measures inherent uncertainties in deterministic systems, such as sensitivity to initial conditions, and is related to the phase space curvature and the net stretching action of the state space evolution. We hypothesize that if a PINN accurately learns the underlying dynamics of a physical system, then the Fisher information landscape derived from the PINN's learned equations of motion will closely match that of the original analytical model. This match would signify that the PINN has achieved comprehensive fidelity capturing not only the state evolution but also crucial geometric and stability properties. We outline an experimental methodology using the dynamical model of a car to compute and compare $g_F^C$ for both the analytical model and a trained PINN. The comparison, based on the Jacobians of the respective system dynamics, provides a quantitative measure of the PINN's fidelity in representing the system's intricate dynamical characteristics.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4f7f\u7528Fisher\u4fe1\u606f\uff08g_F^C\uff09\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8bc4\u4f30PINNs\u5b66\u4e60\u7269\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\u5b8c\u6574\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u5b9a\u91cf\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6bd4\u8f83PINN\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u539f\u59cb\u89e3\u6790\u6a21\u578b\u7684Fisher\u4fe1\u606f\u666f\u89c2\u6765\u9a8c\u8bc1PINN\u7684\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524dPINNs\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u5fae\u5206\u65b9\u7a0b\u548c\u5efa\u6a21\u7269\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u91cf\u5316PINN\u662f\u5426\u5b8c\u6574\u6355\u6349\u7cfb\u7edf\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u884c\u4e3a\uff08\u800c\u4e0d\u4ec5\u4ec5\u662f\u8f68\u8ff9\u9884\u6d4b\uff09\u7684\u4e25\u683c\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u591f\u8bc4\u4f30PINN\u662f\u5426\u51c6\u786e\u5b66\u4e60\u5230\u7cfb\u7edf\u5185\u5728\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u3001\u76f8\u7a7a\u95f4\u66f2\u7387\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u7b49\u5173\u952e\u51e0\u4f55\u7279\u6027\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4f7f\u7528\u53ef\u5fae\u52a8\u529b\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684Fisher\u4fe1\u606f\uff08g_F^C\uff09\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u8be5\u4fe1\u606f\u4e0d\u540c\u4e8e\u7edf\u8ba1Fisher\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u6d4b\u91cf\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u5185\u5728\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff08\u5982\u5bf9\u521d\u59cb\u6761\u4ef6\u7684\u654f\u611f\u6027\uff09\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u8ba1\u7b97PINN\u5b66\u4e60\u5230\u7684\u8fd0\u52a8\u65b9\u7a0b\u4e0e\u539f\u59cb\u89e3\u6790\u6a21\u578b\u7684Jacobian\u77e9\u9635\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e24\u8005\u7684Fisher\u4fe1\u606f\u666f\u89c2\uff0c\u4ee5\u5b9a\u91cf\u8bc4\u4f30PINN\u7684\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u65b9\u6cd5\u91c7\u7528\u6c7d\u8f66\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u6a21\u578b\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6848\u4f8b\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "result": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u5b8c\u6574\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u65b9\u6cd5\u8bba\uff0c\u4f46\u672a\u63d0\u4f9b\u5177\u4f53\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\u80fd\u591f\u901a\u8fc7\u6bd4\u8f83PINN\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u539f\u59cb\u89e3\u6790\u6a21\u578b\u7684Fisher\u4fe1\u606f\u666f\u89c2\uff0c\u5b9a\u91cf\u8bc4\u4f30PINN\u662f\u5426\u51c6\u786e\u6355\u6349\u4e86\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5b8c\u6574\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u76f8\u7a7a\u95f4\u66f2\u7387\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u7b49\u51e0\u4f55\u6027\u8d28\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u57fa\u4e8eFisher\u4fe1\u606f\uff08g_F^C\uff09\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\u4e3aPINNs\u7684\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u8bc4\u4f30\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u5b9a\u91cf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u9a8c\u8bc1PINN\u662f\u5426\u4e0d\u4ec5\u51c6\u786e\u9884\u6d4b\u72b6\u6001\u6f14\u5316\uff0c\u8fd8\u5b8c\u6574\u6355\u6349\u4e86\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5173\u952e\u51e0\u4f55\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u8fd9\u5bf9\u4e8e\u786e\u4fddPINN\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u7269\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\u5efa\u6a21\u4e2d\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\u3002"}}

One of the key challenges of HPC codes is performance portability, i.e. the ability to maintain near-optimal performance across different accelerators. In the context of the \\textbf{REFMAP} project, which targets scalable, GPU-enabled multi-fidelity CFD for urban airflow prediction, this paper analyzes the performance portability of SOD2D, a state-of-the-art Spectral Elements simulation framework across AMD and NVIDIA GPU architectures. We first discuss the physical and numerical models underlying SOD2D, highlighting its computational hotspots. Then, we examine its performance and scalability in a multi-level manner, i.e. defining and characterizing an extensive full-stack design space spanning across application, software and hardware infrastructure related parameters. Single-GPU performance characterization across server-grade NVIDIA and AMD GPU architectures and vendor-specific compiler stacks, show the potential as well as the diverse effect of memory access optimizations, i.e. 0.69$\\times$ - 3.91$\\times$ deviations in acceleration speedup. Performance variability of SOD2D at scale is further examined on the LUMI multi-GPU cluster, where profiling reveals similar throughput variations, highlighting the limits of performance projections and the need for multi-level, informed tuning.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u5206\u6790\u4e86SOD2D CFD\u6846\u67b6\u5728AMD\u548cNVIDIA GPU\u67b6\u6784\u4e0a\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u53ef\u79fb\u690d\u6027\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5185\u5b58\u8bbf\u95ee\u4f18\u5316\u5bf9\u52a0\u901f\u6548\u679c\u5f71\u54cd\u663e\u8457\uff080.69\u00d7-3.91\u00d7\u5dee\u5f02\uff09\uff0c\u591aGPU\u6269\u5c55\u65f6\u5b58\u5728\u6027\u80fd\u6ce2\u52a8\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u9700\u8981\u591a\u5c42\u6b21\u8c03\u4f18\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u5f02\u6784\u8d85\u7ea7\u8ba1\u7b97\u67b6\u6784\u5728HPC\u4e2d\u65e5\u76ca\u91cd\u8981\uff0cCFD\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5178\u578bHPC\u8d1f\u8f7d\u9700\u8981\u9ad8\u6548\u5229\u7528GPU\u786c\u4ef6\u3002\u6027\u80fd\u53ef\u79fb\u690d\u6027\uff08\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u52a0\u901f\u5668\u4e0a\u4fdd\u6301\u8fd1\u6700\u4f18\u6027\u80fd\uff09\u662fHPC\u4ee3\u7801\u7684\u5173\u952e\u6311\u6218\u3002REFMAP\u9879\u76ee\u9488\u5bf9\u57ce\u5e02\u6c14\u6d41\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u591a\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6CFD\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5206\u6790SOD2D\u6846\u67b6\u5728AMD\u548cNVIDIA GPU\u4e0a\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u53ef\u79fb\u690d\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u9996\u5148\u8ba8\u8bbaSOD2D\u7684\u7269\u7406\u548c\u6570\u503c\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u8ba1\u7b97\u70ed\u70b9\u3002\u7136\u540e\u4ee5\u591a\u5c42\u6b21\u65b9\u5f0f\u5206\u6790\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\uff1a\u5b9a\u4e49\u8de8\u8d8a\u5e94\u7528\u3001\u8f6f\u4ef6\u548c\u786c\u4ef6\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u5b8c\u6574\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7a7a\u95f4\u3002\u5728\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u7ea7NVIDIA\u548cAMD GPU\u67b6\u6784\u53ca\u5382\u5546\u7279\u5b9a\u7f16\u8bd1\u5668\u6808\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u5355GPU\u6027\u80fd\u8868\u5f81\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u5185\u5b58\u8bbf\u95ee\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u5728LUMI\u591aGPU\u96c6\u7fa4\u4e0a\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u5206\u6790\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6027\u80fd\u5256\u6790\u63ed\u793a\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u53d8\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u5355GPU\u6027\u80fd\u8868\u5f81\u663e\u793a\u5185\u5b58\u8bbf\u95ee\u4f18\u5316\u5bf9\u52a0\u901f\u6548\u679c\u6709\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u52a0\u901f\u6bd4\u504f\u5dee\u8fbe0.69\u00d7-3.91\u00d7\u3002\u5728LUMI\u591aGPU\u96c6\u7fa4\u4e0a\u7684\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u80fd\u5206\u6790\u663e\u793a\u7c7b\u4f3c\u7684\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u6027\u80fd\u9884\u6d4b\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002\u4e0d\u540cGPU\u67b6\u6784\u548c\u7f16\u8bd1\u5668\u6808\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u7279\u5f81\u3002", "conclusion": "SOD2D\u5728AMD\u548cNVIDIA GPU\u67b6\u6784\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u6027\u80fd\u53ef\u79fb\u690d\u6027\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5185\u5b58\u8bbf\u95ee\u4f18\u5316\u5bf9\u6027\u80fd\u5f71\u54cd\u663e\u8457\u4e14\u591a\u6837\u5316\u3002\u591aGPU\u6269\u5c55\u65f6\u5b58\u5728\u6027\u80fd\u6ce2\u52a8\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u9700\u8981\u57fa\u4e8e\u591a\u5c42\u6b21\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u8c03\u4f18\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u800c\u4e0d\u80fd\u4f9d\u8d56\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u9884\u6d4b\u3002\u8fd9\u4e3a\u5f02\u6784HPC\u67b6\u6784\u4e0a\u7684CFD\u4ee3\u7801\u4f18\u5316\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u91cd\u8981\u89c1\u89e3\u3002"}}

As scientific simulations attempt to exploit exascale systems, there has been a growing demand for distributed FFT algorithms that can effectively utilize modern heterogeneous high-performance computing (HPC) systems. Conventional FFT algorithms commonly encounter performance bottlenecks, especially when run on heterogeneous platforms. Most distributed FFT approaches rely on static task distribution and require synchronization barriers, limiting scalability and impacting overall resource utilization. In this paper we present DaggerFFT, a distributed FFT framework, developed in Julia, that treats highly parallel FFT computations as a dynamically scheduled task graph. Each FFT stage operates on a separately defined distributed array. FFT operations are expressed as DTasks operating on pencil or slab partitioned DArrays. Each FFT stage owns its own DArray, and the runtime assigns DTasks across devices using Dagger's dynamic scheduler that uses work stealing. We demonstrate how DaggerFFT's dynamic scheduler can outperform state-of-the-art distributed FFT libraries on both CPU and GPU backends, achieving up to a 2.6x speedup on CPU clusters and up to a 1.35x speedup on GPU clusters. We have integrated DaggerFFT into Oceananigans.jl, a geophysical fluid dynamics framework, demonstrating that high-level, task-based runtimes can deliver both superior performance and modularity in large-scale, real-world simulations.", "AI": {"tldr": "DaggerFFT\uff1a\u57fa\u4e8eJulia\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u4efb\u52a1\u8c03\u5ea6\u5206\u5e03\u5f0fFFT\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5728CPU\u548cGPU\u96c6\u7fa4\u4e0a\u5206\u522b\u5b9e\u73b02.6\u500d\u548c1.35\u500d\u52a0\u901f", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u79d1\u5b66\u6a21\u62df\u5411\u767e\u4ebf\u4ebf\u6b21\u8ba1\u7b97\u7cfb\u7edf\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u5229\u7528\u73b0\u4ee3\u5f02\u6784\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u8ba1\u7b97\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u5f0fFFT\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002\u4f20\u7edfFFT\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u5f02\u6784\u5e73\u53f0\u4e0a\u5b58\u5728\u6027\u80fd\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u5206\u5e03\u5f0fFFT\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u9759\u6001\u4efb\u52a1\u5206\u914d\u548c\u540c\u6b65\u5c4f\u969c\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u548c\u8d44\u6e90\u5229\u7528\u7387\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faDaggerFFT\u5206\u5e03\u5f0fFFT\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u9ad8\u5ea6\u5e76\u884c\u7684FFT\u8ba1\u7b97\u89c6\u4e3a\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u5ea6\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u56fe\u3002\u6bcf\u4e2aFFT\u9636\u6bb5\u64cd\u4f5c\u5728\u5355\u72ec\u5b9a\u4e49\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u6570\u7ec4\u4e0a\uff0cFFT\u64cd\u4f5c\u8868\u793a\u4e3a\u5728\u94c5\u7b14\u6216\u5e73\u677f\u5206\u533aDArray\u4e0a\u8fd0\u884c\u7684DTasks\u3002\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u4f7f\u7528Dagger\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u5ea6\u5668\uff08\u652f\u6301\u5de5\u4f5c\u7a83\u53d6\uff09\u5728\u8bbe\u5907\u95f4\u5206\u914d\u4efb\u52a1\u3002", "result": "DaggerFFT\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u5ea6\u5668\u5728CPU\u548cGPU\u540e\u7aef\u4e0a\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u5f0fFFT\u5e93\uff0c\u5728CPU\u96c6\u7fa4\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u6700\u9ad82.6\u500d\u52a0\u901f\uff0c\u5728GPU\u96c6\u7fa4\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u6700\u9ad81.35\u500d\u52a0\u901f\u3002\u5df2\u6210\u529f\u96c6\u6210\u5230\u5730\u7403\u7269\u7406\u6d41\u4f53\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u6846\u67b6Oceananigans.jl\u4e2d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\uff08\u5982DaggerFFT\uff09\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5b9e\u9645\u6a21\u62df\u4e2d\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u4f9b\u5353\u8d8a\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u6a21\u5757\u5316\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u9ad8\u7ea7\u4efb\u52a1\u8c03\u5ea6\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u5f02\u6784HPC\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e0a\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\u3002"}}

While scaling model size addresses complexity in broader AI, this approach yields diminishing returns for physics modeling. Drawing inspiration from Hybrid Lagrangian-Eulerian (HLE) numerical methods, we introduce deformable physics-aware recurrent convolutions (D-PARC) to overcome the rigidity of CNNs. Across Burgers' equation, Navier-Stokes, and reactive flows, D-PARC achieves superior fidelity compared to substantially larger architectures. Analysis reveals that kernels display anti-clustering behavior, evolving into a learned \"active filtration\" strategy distinct from traditional h- or p-adaptivity. Effective receptive field analysis confirms that D-PARC autonomously concentrates resources in high-strain regions while coarsening focus elsewhere, mirroring adaptive refinement in computational mechanics. This demonstrates that physically intuitive architectural design can outperform parameter scaling, establishing that strategic learning in lean networks offers a more effective path forward for PADL than indiscriminate network expansion.", "AI": {"tldr": "D-PARC\uff08\u53ef\u53d8\u5f62\u7269\u7406\u611f\u77e5\u5faa\u73af\u5377\u79ef\uff09\u901a\u8fc7\u53d7\u6df7\u5408\u62c9\u683c\u6717\u65e5-\u6b27\u62c9\u65b9\u6cd5\u542f\u53d1\u7684\u53ef\u53d8\u5f62\u5377\u79ef\u6838\uff0c\u5728\u5c0f\u578b\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6bd4\u5927\u578b\u7f51\u7edc\u66f4\u4f18\u7684\u7269\u7406\u6a21\u62df\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u7269\u7406\u76f4\u89c9\u67b6\u6784\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4f18\u4e8e\u53c2\u6570\u6269\u5c55\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524dCNN\u67b6\u6784\u5728\u5904\u7406\u9ad8\u5ea6\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u6d41\u4f53\u65f6\u5b58\u5728\u56f0\u96be\uff0c\u800c\u5355\u7eaf\u6269\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u89c4\u6a21\u5bf9\u7269\u7406\u5efa\u6a21\u6548\u679c\u6709\u9650\u3002\u9700\u8981\u501f\u9274\u8ba1\u7b97\u529b\u5b66\u4e2d\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u66f4\u7b26\u5408\u7269\u7406\u76f4\u89c9\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u67b6\u6784\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faD-PARC\uff08\u53ef\u53d8\u5f62\u7269\u7406\u611f\u77e5\u5faa\u73af\u5377\u79ef\uff09\uff0c\u53d7\u6df7\u5408\u62c9\u683c\u6717\u65e5-\u6b27\u62c9\u6570\u503c\u65b9\u6cd5\u542f\u53d1\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u53ef\u53d8\u5f62\u5377\u79ef\u6838\u66ff\u4ee3\u4f20\u7edfCNN\u7684\u521a\u6027\u5377\u79ef\u6838\uff0c\u4f7f\u7f51\u7edc\u80fd\u591f\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5730\u8c03\u6574\u611f\u53d7\u91ce\u3002", "result": "\u5728Burgers\u65b9\u7a0b\u3001Navier-Stokes\u65b9\u7a0b\u548c\u53cd\u5e94\u6d41\u7b49\u591a\u4e2a\u7269\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\uff0cD-PARC\u5728\u8f83\u5c0f\u7f51\u7edc\u89c4\u6a21\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6bd4\u5927\u578b\u67b6\u6784\u66f4\u4f18\u7684\u6a21\u62df\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002\u5206\u6790\u663e\u793a\u5377\u79ef\u6838\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u53cd\u805a\u96c6\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u5f62\u6210\u4e86\u72ec\u7279\u7684\"\u4e3b\u52a8\u8fc7\u6ee4\"\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7269\u7406\u76f4\u89c9\u7684\u67b6\u6784\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4f18\u4e8e\u53c2\u6570\u6269\u5c55\uff0c\u7cbe\u7b80\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u6027\u5b66\u4e60\u4e3a\u7269\u7406\u611f\u77e5\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u7684\u8def\u5f84\uff0cD-PARC\u80fd\u591f\u81ea\u4e3b\u5730\u5728\u9ad8\u5e94\u53d8\u533a\u57df\u96c6\u4e2d\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\uff0c\u7c7b\u4f3c\u4e8e\u8ba1\u7b97\u529b\u5b66\u4e2d\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7ec6\u5316\u3002"}}

In this study, we present a machine learning (ML) framework capable of accurately predicting the wettability of laser-textured metal alloys using experimentally derived morphological and chemical features. Superhydrophilic and superhydrophobic surfaces were fabricated on AA6061 and AISI 4130 alloys via nanosecond laser texturing followed by chemical immersion treatments. Surface morphology was quantified using the Laws texture energy method and profilometry, while surface chemistry was characterized through X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), extracting features such as functional group polarity, molecular volume, and peak area fraction. These features were used to train an ensemble neural network model incorporating residual connections, batch normalization, and dropout regularization. The model achieved high predictive accuracy (R2 = 0.942, RMSE = 13.896), outperforming previous approaches. Feature importance analysis revealed that surface chemistry had the strongest influence on contact angle prediction, with topographical features also contributing significantly.

These continual changes pose significant challenges for efficient inference in graph neural networks (GNNs). Existing vertex-wise and layer-wise inference approaches are ill-suited for dynamic graphs, as they incur redundant computations, large neighborhood traversals, and high communication costs, especially in distributed settings. Additionally, while sampling-based approaches can be adopted to approximate final layer embeddings, these are often not preferred in critical applications due to their non-determinism. These limitations hinder low-latency inference required in real-time applications. To address this, we propose RIPPLE++, a framework for streaming GNN inference that efficiently and accurately updates embeddings in response to changes in the graph structure or features. RIPPLE++ introduces a generalized incremental programming model that captures the semantics of GNN aggregation functions and incrementally propagates updates to affected neighborhoods. RIPPLE++ accommodates all common graph updates, including vertex/edge addition/deletions and vertex feature updates. RIPPLE++ supports both single-machine and distributed deployments. On a single machine, it achieves up to $56$K updates/sec on sparse graphs like Arxiv ($169$K vertices, $1.2$M edges), and about $7.6$K updates/sec on denser graphs like Products ($2.5$M vertices, $123.7$M edges), with latencies of $0.06$--$960$ms, and outperforming state-of-the-art baselines by $2.2$--$24\\times$ on throughput.

Two dominant paradigms have emerged: activation-aware methods such as AWQ prioritize channels with large activation magnitudes, while second-order methods such as GPTQ allocate quantization error according to input covariance structure. Despite strong empirical performance, these approaches remain conceptually fragmented, and it is unclear what underlying quantity they are approximating. In this work, we present a unified theoretical framework for PTQ by formalizing activation sensitivity, defined as the expected impact of channel-wise perturbations on the loss. Using a first-order Taylor expansion, we show that sensitivity naturally arises as the squared norm of gradient-weighted activations, yielding a principled measure of channel importance that captures both activation magnitude and downstream error propagation. Within this framework, AWQ and GPTQ can be interpreted as complementary approximations that recover sensitivity under distinct simplifying assumptions. We analyze the design space of sensitivity metrics, connect gradient-based saliency, Fisher information, and Hessian-based criteria, and clarify their relationships to classical pruning methods such as Optimal Brain Damage and Optimal Brain Surgeon.

We present ASAS-BridgeAMM, a bridge-coupled automated market maker that introduces Contained Degradation: a formally specified operational state where the system gracefully degrades functionality in response to adversarial signals. By treating cross-chain message latency as a quantifiable execution risk, the protocol dynamically adjusts collateral haircuts, slippage bounds, and withdrawal limits. Across 18 months of historical replay on Ethereum and two auxiliary chains, ASAS-BridgeAMM reduces worst-case bridge-induced insolvency by 73% relative to baseline mint-and-burn architectures, while preserving 104.5% of transaction volume during stress periods. In rigorous adversarial simulations involving delayed finality, oracle manipulation, and liquidity griefing, the protocol maintains solvency with probability $>0.9999$ and bounds per-epoch bad debt to $<0.2%$ of total collateral.

We address both issues by first transferring weights from the pretrained full-attention modules to its linear attention counterparts through blockwise local distillation, and second, introducing a greedy layer replacement strategy that iteratively substitutes full attention blocks with linear ones while monitoring validation performance on the target task.

However, deploying such collaboration at scale remains difficult when communication bandwidth is limited and no roadside infrastructure is available. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a fully decentralized framework that enables vehicles to self organize into cooperative groups using only vehicle to vehicle communication. The approach decomposes the problem into two sequential game theoretic stages. In the first stage, vehicles form stable clusters by evaluating mutual sensing complementarity and motion coherence, and each cluster elects a coordinator. In the second stage, the coordinator guides its members to selectively transmit point cloud segments from perceptually salient regions through a non cooperative potential game, enabling efficient local fusion.

To ensure sample quality, we design a robust dual-filtering mechanism that assesses each query sample based on both global prediction confidence and local discriminative ability. By aggregating this auxiliary set with the support set in subsequent tasks, IPEC builds progressively more stable and representative prototypes, effectively reducing its reliance on the initial support set. We ground this approach in a Bayesian interpretation, conceptualizing the support set as a prior and the auxiliary set as a data-driven posterior, which in turn motivates the design of a practical \"warm-up and test\" two-stage inference protocol.

In practice, deep networks are often overconfident: high-confidence predictions can still be wrong, while informative low-confidence samples near decision boundaries are discarded. This paper introduces a Confidence-Variance (CoVar) theory framework that provides a principled joint reliability criterion for pseudo-label selection. Starting from the entropy minimization principle, we derive a reliability measure that combines maximum confidence (MC) with residual-class variance (RCV), which characterizes how probability mass is distributed over non-maximum classes. The derivation shows that reliable pseudo-labels should have both high MC and low RCV, and that the influence of RCV increases as confidence grows, thereby correcting overconfident but unstable predictions. From this perspective, we cast pseudo-label selection as a spectral relaxation problem that maximizes separability in a confidence-variance feature space, and design a threshold-free selection mechanism to distinguish high- from low-reliability predictions. We integrate CoVar as a plug-in module into representative semi-supervised semantic segmentation and image classification methods. Across PASCAL VOC 2012, Cityscapes, CIFAR-10, and Mini-ImageNet with varying label ratios and backbones, it consistently improves over strong baselines, indicating that combining confidence with residual-class variance provides a more reliable basis for pseudo-label selection than fixed confidence thresholds.

Collaborative perception improves accuracy by mitigating the sensing limitations of individual vehicles, such as limited perception range and occlusion-induced blind spots. However, collaborative perception often suffers from high communication overhead due to redundant data transmission, as well as increasing computation latency caused by excessive load with growing connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) participation. To address these challenges, we propose a novel local-to-global collaborative perception framework (LGCP) to achieve collaboration in a communication- and computation-efficient manner. The road of interest is partitioned into non-overlapping areas, each of which is assigned a dedicated CAV group to perform localized perception. A designated leader in each group collects and fuses perception data from its members, and uploads the perception result to the roadside unit (RSU), establishing a link between local perception and global awareness.

A recent trend is to develop RL systems with a fully disaggregated architecture, which decouples the three RL phases (rollout, reward, and training) onto separate resources and executes them asynchronously. However, two critical data-level concerns arise: (1) asynchronous execution leads to data staleness in trajectories (the data generated by rollout) as the model parameters used in rollout may not be up to date, which impairs RL convergence; and (2) the length variation of trajectories introduces severe data skewness, leading to workload imbalance and degraded system performance.\n  Existing systems fail to address these two concerns in a unified manner. Techniques that tightly control data staleness often constrain effective data skewness mitigation, while aggressive data skewness mitigation tends to exacerbate data staleness. As a result, systems are forced to trade off convergence for performance, or vice versa. To address this, we propose StaleFlow, an RL post-training system that jointly tackles data staleness and skewness. First, to control staleness, StaleFlow introduces a global consistency protocol that tracks the full lifecycle of each trajectory and constrains staleness. Second, to mitigate skewness, StaleFlow re-designs the RL system architecture by constructing data servers for trajectories and parameters to achieve flexible rollout coordination. Subsequently, we develop a suite of staleness-aware, throughput-oriented strategies to enhance system performance. Evaluations show that StaleFlow achieves up to 1.42-2.68$\\times$ (1.17-2.01$\\times$ on average) higher throughput than state-of-the-art systems, without compromising convergence.", "AI": {"tldr": "StaleFlow\uff1a\u4e00\u4e2a\u89e3\u51b3\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u6570\u636e\u9648\u65e7\u6027\u548c\u504f\u659c\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5168\u5c40\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u534f\u8bae\u548c\u91cd\u6784\u67b6\u6784\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u4e14\u4e0d\u635f\u5bb3\u6536\u655b\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5b8c\u5168\u89e3\u8026\u67b6\u6784\u7684RL\u7cfb\u7edf\u9762\u4e34\u4e24\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u6570\u636e\u95ee\u9898\uff1a\u5f02\u6b65\u6267\u884c\u5bfc\u81f4\u8f68\u8ff9\u6570\u636e\u9648\u65e7\uff08\u5f71\u54cd\u6536\u655b\uff09\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u8f68\u8ff9\u957f\u5ea6\u53d8\u5316\u5bfc\u81f4\u6570\u636e\u504f\u659c\uff08\u5f71\u54cd\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u80fd\uff09\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u7cfb\u7edf\u65e0\u6cd5\u7edf\u4e00\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e24\u4e2a\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5fc5\u987b\u5728\u6536\u655b\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u4e4b\u95f4\u505a\u51fa\u6743\u8861\u3002", "method": "1. \u5f15\u5165\u5168\u5c40\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u534f\u8bae\u8ddf\u8e2a\u6bcf\u4e2a\u8f68\u8ff9\u7684\u5168\u751f\u547d\u5468\u671f\u4ee5\u63a7\u5236\u6570\u636e\u9648\u65e7\u6027\uff1b2. \u91cd\u6784RL\u7cfb\u7edf\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u8f68\u8ff9\u548c\u53c2\u6570\u6570\u636e\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u5b9e\u73b0\u7075\u6d3b\u7684rollout\u534f\u8c03\uff1b3. \u5f00\u53d1\u4e00\u5957\u9762\u5411\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u7684\u9648\u65e7\u6027\u611f\u77e5\u7b56\u7565\u6765\u63d0\u5347\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "result": "StaleFlow\u76f8\u6bd4\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7cfb\u7edf\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e861.42-2.68\u500d\uff08\u5e73\u57471.17-2.01\u500d\uff09\u7684\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u4e14\u4e0d\u635f\u5bb3\u6536\u655b\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "StaleFlow\u6210\u529f\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86RL\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u7684\u6570\u636e\u9648\u65e7\u6027\u548c\u504f\u659c\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6536\u655b\u6027\u548c\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u4e3a\u5927\u89c4\u6a21RL\u8bad\u7ec3\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

This approach significantly advances orbital management by establishing a benchmark for renewable solar propulsion that minimizes reliance on conventional fuels and extends mission longevity for multi-target removal.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u578b\u8f68\u9053\u788e\u7247\u6e05\u9664\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u673a\u68b0\u5939\u6301\u7cfb\u7edf\u3001\u592a\u9633\u80fd\u63a8\u8fdb\u5668\u548c\u81ea\u4e3b\u5bfc\u822a\u534f\u8bae\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u71c3\u6599\u4f9d\u8d56\u5ea6\u4f4e\u7684\u788e\u7247\u6e05\u9664\u65b9\u6848", "motivation": "\u8f68\u9053\u788e\u7247\u65e5\u76ca\u589e\u591a\u5a01\u80c1\u7a7a\u95f4\u64cd\u4f5c\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u6027\uff0c\u5f53\u524d\u71c3\u6599\u4f9d\u8d56\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u7684\u6e05\u9664\u65b9\u6848", "method": "\u6574\u5408\u673a\u68b0\u5939\u6301\u7cfb\u7edf\u7528\u4e8e\u5b89\u5168\u6355\u83b7\u788e\u7247\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u9ad8\u6548\u592a\u9633\u80fdNASA\u8fdb\u5316\u6c19\u63a8\u8fdb\u5668(NEXT)\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u81ea\u4e3b\u5bfc\u822a\u534f\u8bae\u548c\u96f7\u8fbe\u6269\u5c55\u5361\u5c14\u66fc\u6ee4\u6ce2\u5bfc\u822a\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u5ef6\u8fdf/\u4e2d\u65ad\u5bb9\u5fcd\u7f51\u7edc\u534f\u8bae\u8fdb\u884c\u6570\u636e\u4f20\u8f93", "result": "\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u4eff\u771f\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6210\u529f\u5b9e\u73b0\u4ece800\u516c\u91cc\u5230100\u516c\u91cc\u7684\u9006\u884c\u79bb\u8f68\uff0c\u4f4d\u7f6e\u5747\u65b9\u6839\u8bef\u5dee\u5c0f\u4e8e10\u7c73\uff0c\u5ef6\u8fdf/\u4e2d\u65ad\u5bb9\u5fcd\u7f51\u7edc\u534f\u8bae\u57281\u79d2\u5185\u5b9e\u73b093%\u7684\u6570\u636e\u4f20\u8f93\u6548\u7387", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u67b6\u6784\u663e\u8457\u63a8\u8fdb\u8f68\u9053\u7ba1\u7406\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u53ef\u518d\u751f\u592a\u9633\u80fd\u63a8\u8fdb\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u5bf9\u4f20\u7edf\u71c3\u6599\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\uff0c\u5ef6\u957f\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u6e05\u9664\u4efb\u52a1\u5bff\u547d"}}

This phenomenon describes the behavior of gradient alignment in SGD updates. Specifically, during the initial phase of SGD updates, the alignment between the gradient and the dominant subspace tends to decrease. Subsequently, it enters a rising phase and eventually stabilizes in a high-alignment phase. The alignment is considered ``suspicious'' because, paradoxically, the projected gradient update along this highly-aligned dominant subspace proves ineffective at reducing the loss. The focus of this work is to give a fine-grained analysis in a high-dimensional quadratic setup about how step size selection produces this phenomenon. Our main contribution can be summarized as follows: We propose a step-size condition revealing that in low-alignment regimes, an adaptive critical step size $\u03b7_t^*$ separates alignment-decreasing ($\u03b7_t < \u03b7_t^*$) from alignment-increasing ($\u03b7_t > \u03b7_t^*$) regimes, whereas in high-alignment regimes, the alignment is self-correcting and decreases regardless of the step size. We further show that under sufficient ill-conditioning, a step size interval exists where projecting the SGD updates to the bulk space decreases the loss while projecting them to the dominant space increases the loss, which explains a recent empirical observation that projecting gradient updates to the dominant subspace is ineffective. Finally, based on this adaptive step-size theory, we prove that for a constant step size and large initialization, SGD exhibits this distinct two-phase behavior: an initial alignment-decreasing phase, followed by stabilization at high alignment.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86SGD\u5728\u75c5\u6001\u4f18\u5316\u4e2d\u7684\"\u53ef\u7591\u5bf9\u9f50\"\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u68af\u5ea6\u4e0e\u4e3b\u5bfc\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u5bf9\u9f50\u5448\u73b0\u5148\u4e0b\u964d\u3001\u540e\u4e0a\u5347\u3001\u6700\u7ec8\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u4e09\u9636\u6bb5\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u5e76\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u6b65\u957f\u9009\u62e9\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u8fd9\u4e00\u73b0\u8c61\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76SGD\u5728\u75c5\u6001\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u4e2d\u51fa\u73b0\u7684\"\u53ef\u7591\u5bf9\u9f50\"\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u5373\u68af\u5ea6\u4e0eHessian\u4e3b\u5bfc\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u5bf9\u9f50\u884c\u4e3a\u3002\u8fd9\u79cd\u5bf9\u9f50\u88ab\u79f0\u4e3a\"\u53ef\u7591\"\u7684\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u5c3d\u7ba1\u68af\u5ea6\u4e0e\u4e3b\u5bfc\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u9ad8\u5ea6\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u4f46\u6cbf\u8be5\u65b9\u5411\u7684\u66f4\u65b0\u5374\u65e0\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u964d\u4f4e\u635f\u5931\u3002\u9700\u8981\u6df1\u5165\u7406\u89e3\u6b65\u957f\u9009\u62e9\u5982\u4f55\u4ea7\u751f\u8fd9\u79cd\u73b0\u8c61\u3002", "method": "\u5728\u9ad8\u7ef4\u4e8c\u6b21\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u5206\u6790\u3002\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u6b65\u957f\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5728\u4f4e\u5bf9\u9f50\u533a\u57df\u5b58\u5728\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u4e34\u754c\u6b65\u957f\u03b7_t^*\uff0c\u533a\u5206\u4e86\u5bf9\u9f50\u4e0b\u964d\u548c\u5bf9\u9f50\u4e0a\u5347\u7684\u6b65\u957f\u533a\u95f4\u3002\u5728\u9ad8\u5bf9\u9f50\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u5bf9\u9f50\u5177\u6709\u81ea\u6821\u6b63\u7279\u6027\u3002\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5728\u8db3\u591f\u75c5\u6001\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u6b65\u957f\u533a\u95f4\u4f7f\u5f97\u5411bulk\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u6295\u5f71\u80fd\u964d\u4f4e\u635f\u5931\uff0c\u800c\u5411\u4e3b\u5bfc\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u6295\u5f71\u53cd\u800c\u589e\u52a0\u635f\u5931\u3002", "result": "\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u6b65\u957f\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5728\u5e38\u6570\u6b65\u957f\u548c\u5927\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\uff0cSGD\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u660e\u663e\u7684\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u884c\u4e3a\uff1a\u521d\u59cb\u5bf9\u9f50\u4e0b\u964d\u9636\u6bb5\uff0c\u968f\u540e\u7a33\u5b9a\u5728\u9ad8\u5bf9\u9f50\u9636\u6bb5\u3002\u8fd9\u89e3\u91ca\u4e86\u6700\u8fd1\u5b9e\u8bc1\u89c2\u5bdf\u5230\u7684\u73b0\u8c61\uff1a\u5c06\u68af\u5ea6\u66f4\u65b0\u6295\u5f71\u5230\u4e3b\u5bfc\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u662f\u65e0\u6548\u7684\u3002", "conclusion": "SGD\u5728\u75c5\u6001\u4f18\u5316\u4e2d\u7684\"\u53ef\u7591\u5bf9\u9f50\"\u73b0\u8c61\u53ef\u4ee5\u901a\u8fc7\u6b65\u957f\u9009\u62e9\u7406\u8bba\u5f97\u5230\u89e3\u91ca\u3002\u5728\u4f4e\u5bf9\u9f50\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u6b65\u957f\u76f8\u5bf9\u4e8e\u4e34\u754c\u6b65\u957f\u7684\u4f4d\u7f6e\u51b3\u5b9a\u4e86\u5bf9\u9f50\u53d8\u5316\u65b9\u5411\uff1b\u5728\u9ad8\u5bf9\u9f50\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u5bf9\u9f50\u5177\u6709\u81ea\u6821\u6b63\u7279\u6027\u3002\u8fd9\u4e00\u7406\u8bba\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3SGD\u5728\u75c5\u6001\u95ee\u9898\u4e2d\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u89c6\u89d2\u3002"}}

Traditional deep learning denoising approaches demand large datasets impractical to obtain from limited UAV flight campaigns. We present PC$^2$DAE, a physics-informed denoising autoencoder that addresses data scarcity by embedding physical constraints directly into the network architecture. Non-negative concentration estimates are enforced via softplus activations and physically plausible temporal smoothing, ensuring outputs are physically admissible by construction rather than relying on loss function penalties. The architecture employs hierarchical decoder heads for Black Carbon, Gas, and CO$_2$ sensor families, with two variants: PC$^2$DAE-Lean (21k parameters) for edge deployment and PC$^2$DAE-Wide (204k parameters) for offline processing. We evaluate on 7,894 synchronized 1 Hz samples collected from UAV flights during prescribed burns in Saskatchewan, Canada (approximately 2.2 hours of flight data), two orders of magnitude below typical deep learning requirements. PC$^2$DAE-Lean achieves 67.3\\% smoothness improvement and 90.7\\% high-frequency noise reduction with zero physics violations.

Such tool-based agents are rapidly becoming the dominant paradigm for deploying language models in production. Unlike traditional single-turn inference, agentic workloads chain together multiple LLM calls and tool executions before producing a final response, creating a new performance bottleneck that manifests as increased latency in First Token Rendered (FTR) of the final answer. Through analysis of synthetic requests at production scale, we reveal three critical challenges: tool calls account for 30-80% of FTR latency, KV cache hit rates collapse despite substantial context reuse across iterations, and sequential orchestration wastes potential intra-request parallelism by sequentially executing LLM calls and tools. These bottlenecks stem from a design gap in which orchestrators and LLM engines operate as decoupled black boxes, preventing cross-layer optimizations. We present SUTRADHARA, a co-designed agentic inference system that integrates orchestration with LLM serving through a thin API enabling three optimizations: overlap tool execution with subsequent LLM prefill using tool-aware prompt splitting, streaming tool execution to dispatch tools incrementally during decode rather than waiting for complete output, and orchestrator-aware cache management that uses semantic hints to improve hit rates and reduce thrashing. Implemented on vLLM, SUTRADHARA reduces median FTR latency by 15% and end-to-end latency by 10% across workloads on A100 GPUs, demonstrating that co-design can systematically tame latency in agentic systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "SUTRADHARA\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u534f\u540c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u63a8\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6574\u5408\u7f16\u6392\u4e0eLLM\u670d\u52a1\uff0c\u4f18\u5316\u5de5\u5177\u8c03\u7528\u4e0eLLM\u6267\u884c\u7684\u5e76\u884c\u6027\uff0c\u964d\u4f4e\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5e94\u7528\u7684\u5ef6\u8fdf\u3002", "motivation": "\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u5de5\u5177\u8c03\u7528\u5360\u6700\u7ec8\u7b54\u6848\u9996\u6b21\u6e32\u67d3\u5ef6\u8fdf\u768430-80%\uff0cKV\u7f13\u5b58\u547d\u4e2d\u7387\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u987a\u5e8f\u7f16\u6392\u6d6a\u8d39\u4e86\u6f5c\u5728\u7684\u5e76\u884c\u6027\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u7f16\u6392\u5668\u548cLLM\u5f15\u64ce\u4f5c\u4e3a\u89e3\u8026\u7684\u9ed1\u76d2\u8bbe\u8ba1\u963b\u788d\u4e86\u8de8\u5c42\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faSUTRADHARA\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8584API\u6574\u5408\u7f16\u6392\u4e0eLLM\u670d\u52a1\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e09\u79cd\u4f18\u5316\uff1a1) \u5de5\u5177\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u63d0\u793a\u5206\u5272\uff0c\u91cd\u53e0\u5de5\u5177\u6267\u884c\u4e0e\u540e\u7eedLLM\u9884\u586b\u5145\uff1b2) \u6d41\u5f0f\u5de5\u5177\u6267\u884c\uff0c\u5728\u89e3\u7801\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u589e\u91cf\u8c03\u5ea6\u5de5\u5177\uff1b3) \u7f16\u6392\u5668\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u7f13\u5b58\u7ba1\u7406\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u8bed\u4e49\u63d0\u793a\u63d0\u9ad8\u547d\u4e2d\u7387\u3002", "result": "\u5728vLLM\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\uff0c\u5728A100 GPU\u4e0a\uff0cSUTRADHARA\u5c06\u4e2d\u4f4d\u6570\u9996\u6b21\u6e32\u67d3\u5ef6\u8fdf\u964d\u4f4e15%\uff0c\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u5ef6\u8fdf\u964d\u4f4e10%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u534f\u540c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u53ef\u4ee5\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5730\u964d\u4f4e\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u5ef6\u8fdf\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u5de5\u5177\u8c03\u7528\u3001\u7f13\u5b58\u7ba1\u7406\u548c\u5e76\u884c\u6267\u884c\u7b49\u5173\u952e\u74f6\u9888\u3002"}}

Although they exhibit strong average zero-shot performance on forecasting tasks, their predictions on certain critical regions of the data are not always reliable, limiting their usability in real-world applications, especially when data exhibits unique trends. In this paper, we propose a selective forecasting framework to identify these critical segments of time series using shapelets. We learn shapelets using shift-invariant dictionary learning on the validation split of the target domain dataset. Utilizing distance-based similarity to these shapelets, we facilitate the user to selectively discard unreliable predictions and be informed of the model's realistic capabilities. Empirical results on diverse benchmark time series datasets demonstrate that our approach leveraging both zero-shot and full-shot fine-tuned models reduces the overall error by an average of 22.17% for zero-shot and 22.62% for full-shot fine-tuned model.

However, with the emergence of Maximal Extractable Value (MEV), concerns about economic centralization and content manipulation have intensified. To address these vulnerabilities, the Ethereum community has introduced Proposer Builder Separation (PBS), which separates block construction from block proposal. Later, enshrined Proposer Builder Separation (ePBS) was also proposed in EIP-7732, which embeds PBS directly into the Ethereum consensus layer.\n  Our work identifies key limitations of ePBS by developing a formal framework that combines mathematical analysis and agent-based simulations to evaluate its auction-based block-building mechanism, with particular emphasis on MEV dynamics. Our results reveal that, although ePBS redistributes responsibilities between builders and proposers, it significantly amplifies profit and content centralization: the Gini coefficient for profits rises from 0.1749 under standard PoS without ePBS to 0.8358 under ePBS. This sharp increase indicates that a small number of efficient builders capture most value via MEV-driven auctions. Moreover, 95.4% of the block value is rewarded to proposers in ePBS, revealing a strong economic bias despite their limited role in block assembly. These findings highlight that ePBS exacerbates incentives for builders to adopt aggressive MEV strategies, suggesting the need for future research into mechanism designs that better balance decentralization, fairness, and MEV mitigation.", "AI": {"tldr": "ePBS\u867d\u7136\u5206\u79bb\u4e86\u533a\u5757\u6784\u5efa\u548c\u63d0\u8bae\uff0c\u4f46\u663e\u8457\u52a0\u5267\u4e86\u5229\u6da6\u96c6\u4e2d\u5316\uff0cGini\u7cfb\u6570\u4ece0.1749\u5347\u81f30.8358\uff0c\u5c11\u6570\u9ad8\u6548\u6784\u5efa\u8005\u901a\u8fc7MEV\u62cd\u5356\u83b7\u53d6\u5927\u90e8\u5206\u4ef7\u503c\uff0c95.4%\u533a\u5757\u4ef7\u503c\u6d41\u5411\u63d0\u8bae\u8005\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u65b0\u673a\u5236\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5e73\u8861\u53bb\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316\u3001\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u548cMEV\u7f13\u89e3\u3002", "motivation": "PoS\u5171\u8bc6\u673a\u5236\u4e2d\u4ea4\u6613\u5904\u7406\u7684\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u5bf9\u7ef4\u62a4\u53bb\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316\u548c\u7528\u6237\u4fe1\u4efb\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46MEV\u7684\u51fa\u73b0\u52a0\u5267\u4e86\u7ecf\u6d4e\u96c6\u4e2d\u5316\u548c\u5185\u5bb9\u64cd\u7eb5\u7684\u62c5\u5fe7\u3002\u867d\u7136ePBS\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u79bb\u533a\u5757\u6784\u5efa\u548c\u63d0\u8bae\u6765\u5e94\u5bf9\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6f0f\u6d1e\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u5b9e\u9645\u6548\u679c\u9700\u8981\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7ed3\u5408\u6570\u5b66\u5206\u6790\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u4ee3\u7406\u6a21\u62df\u7684\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u5173\u6ce8MEV\u52a8\u6001\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30ePBS\u7684\u62cd\u5356\u5f0f\u533a\u5757\u6784\u5efa\u673a\u5236\u3002", "result": "ePBS\u663e\u8457\u52a0\u5267\u4e86\u5229\u6da6\u548c\u5185\u5bb9\u96c6\u4e2d\u5316\uff1a\u5229\u6da6\u7684Gini\u7cfb\u6570\u4ece\u6807\u51c6PoS\u76840.1749\u4e0a\u5347\u5230ePBS\u4e0b\u76840.8358\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u5c11\u6570\u9ad8\u6548\u6784\u5efa\u8005\u901a\u8fc7MEV\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u62cd\u5356\u83b7\u53d6\u5927\u90e8\u5206\u4ef7\u503c\u300295.4%\u7684\u533a\u5757\u4ef7\u503c\u5956\u52b1\u7ed9\u63d0\u8bae\u8005\uff0c\u5c3d\u7ba1\u4ed6\u4eec\u5728\u533a\u5757\u7ec4\u88c5\u4e2d\u4f5c\u7528\u6709\u9650\u3002", "conclusion": "ePBS\u52a0\u5267\u4e86\u6784\u5efa\u8005\u91c7\u7528\u6fc0\u8fdbMEV\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u6fc0\u52b1\uff0c\u7a81\u663e\u4e86\u672a\u6765\u9700\u8981\u7814\u7a76\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u673a\u5236\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u4ee5\u5e73\u8861\u53bb\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316\u3001\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u548cMEV\u7f13\u89e3\u3002"}}

We introduce MixFlow, a conditional flow-matching framework for descriptor-controlled generation that directly targets this limitation by jointly learning a descriptor-conditioned base distribution and a descriptor-conditioned flow field via shortest-path flow matching. By modeling the base distribution as a learnable, descriptor-dependent mixture, MixFlow enables smooth interpolation and extrapolation to unseen conditions, leading to substantially improved out-of-distribution generalization. We provide analytical insights into the behavior of the proposed framework and empirically demonstrate its effectiveness across multiple domains, including prediction of responses to unseen perturbations in single-cell transcriptomic data and high-content microscopy-based drug screening tasks. Across these diverse settings, MixFlow consistently outperforms standard conditional flow-matching baselines.

However, traditional global norm clipping erroneously presupposes gradient homogeneity across different functional modules, leading to an adverse \"spill-over\" effect where volatile parameters force unnecessary scaling on stable ones. To overcome this, we propose Adaptive Group-wise Gradient Clipping (AGGC). AGGC partitions parameters into groups based on functional types and regulates each according to its historical behavior using an Exponential Moving Average (EMA). Specifically, it constructs an adaptive interval to simultaneously mitigate gradient explosion and vanishing, while employing a time-dependent scheduling mechanism to balance exploration and convergence. Experiments on LLaMA 2-7B, Mistral-7B, and Gemma-7B models show that AGGC consistently outperforms LoRA and frequently surpasses Full Fine-Tuning. On the GSM8K benchmark, Mistral-7B fine-tuned with AGGC achieves an accuracy of 72.93%, exceeding LoRA's 69.5%. AGGC also effectively stabilizes Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR), enhancing the logic deduction of Qwen 2.5 and Llama 3.2 models. Experimental results demonstrate that AGGC effectively addresses the limitations of traditional gradient clipping methods, particularly in overcoming gradient heterogeneity, by utilizing a modular, adaptive clipping strategy to stabilize the training process. Due to its lightweight design, AGGC can be seamlessly integrated into existing post-training pipelines with negligible overhead.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5206\u7ec4\u68af\u5ea6\u88c1\u526a(AGGC)\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6309\u529f\u80fd\u7c7b\u578b\u5206\u7ec4\u5e76\u57fa\u4e8e\u5386\u53f2\u884c\u4e3a\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8c03\u8282\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4f20\u7edf\u5168\u5c40\u68af\u5ea6\u88c1\u526a\u4e2d\u7684\u68af\u5ea6\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2aLLM\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8eLoRA\u548c\u5168\u5fae\u8c03\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u5168\u5c40\u68af\u5ea6\u88c1\u526a\u5047\u8bbe\u6240\u6709\u53c2\u6570\u68af\u5ea6\u540c\u8d28\uff0c\u4f46\u5b9e\u9645\u4e0a\u4e0d\u540c\u529f\u80fd\u6a21\u5757\u68af\u5ea6\u884c\u4e3a\u5dee\u5f02\u5f88\u5927\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\"\u6ea2\u51fa\u6548\u5e94\"\u2014\u2014\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u53c2\u6570\u8feb\u4f7f\u7a33\u5b9a\u53c2\u6570\u88ab\u4e0d\u5fc5\u8981\u5730\u7f29\u653e\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u8bad\u7ec3\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "method": "AGGC\u5c06\u53c2\u6570\u6309\u529f\u80fd\u7c7b\u578b\u5206\u7ec4\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u6307\u6570\u79fb\u52a8\u5e73\u5747(EMA)\u8ddf\u8e2a\u6bcf\u7ec4\u5386\u53f2\u68af\u5ea6\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u533a\u95f4\u540c\u65f6\u7f13\u89e3\u68af\u5ea6\u7206\u70b8\u548c\u6d88\u5931\uff0c\u5e76\u91c7\u7528\u65f6\u95f4\u76f8\u5173\u8c03\u5ea6\u673a\u5236\u5e73\u8861\u63a2\u7d22\u4e0e\u6536\u655b\u3002", "result": "\u5728LLaMA 2-7B\u3001Mistral-7B\u3001Gemma-7B\u4e0a\uff0cAGGC\u6301\u7eed\u4f18\u4e8eLoRA\u5e76\u7ecf\u5e38\u8d85\u8d8a\u5168\u5fae\u8c03\u3002GSM8K\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\uff0cMistral-7B+AGGC\u8fbe\u523072.93%\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8eLoRA\u768469.5%\u3002AGGC\u8fd8\u80fd\u7a33\u5b9aRLVR\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u63d0\u5347Qwen 2.5\u548cLlama 3.2\u7684\u903b\u8f91\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "AGGC\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u88c1\u526a\u7b56\u7565\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u68af\u5ea6\u88c1\u526a\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u68af\u5ea6\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u5176\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u8bbe\u8ba1\u53ef\u65e0\u7f1d\u96c6\u6210\u5230\u73b0\u6709\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u6d41\u7a0b\u4e2d\uff0c\u5f00\u9500\u53ef\u5ffd\u7565\u3002"}}

The $1$-Interval Connectivity model was introduced by Kuhn et al.~[STOC 2010], and the Connectivity Time model was proposed by Michail et al.~[JPDC 2014]. Recently, Saxena et al.~[TCS 2025] investigated the exploration problem under both models. In this work, we first strengthen the existing impossibility results for the $1$-Interval Connectivity model. We then show that, in Connectivity Time dynamic graphs, exploration is impossible with $\\frac{(n-1)(n-2)}{2}$ mobile agents, even when the agents have full knowledge of all system parameters, global communication, full visibility, and infinite memory. This significantly improves the previously known bound of $n$. Moreover, we prove that to solve exploration with $\\frac{(n-1)(n-2)}{2}+1$ agents, $1$-hop visibility is necessary. Finally, we present an exploration algorithm that uses $\\frac{(n-1)(n-2)}{2}+1$ agents, assuming global communication, $1$-hop visibility, and $O(\\log n)$ memory per agent.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u52a8\u6001\u56fe\u4e2d\u79fb\u52a8\u4ee3\u7406\u7684\u63a2\u7d22\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u57281-Interval Connectivity\u548cConnectivity Time\u4e24\u79cd\u6a21\u578b\u4e0b\uff0c\u6539\u8fdb\u4e86\u4e0d\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u63a2\u7d22\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u52a8\u6001\u56fe\u4e2d\u79fb\u52a8\u4ee3\u7406\u7684\u63a2\u7d22\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u4e24\u79cd\u91cd\u8981\u6a21\u578b\uff081-Interval Connectivity\u548cConnectivity Time\uff09\u4e0b\uff0c\u6539\u8fdb\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u4e0d\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u7ed3\u679c\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6709\u6548\u7684\u63a2\u7d22\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u9996\u5148\u52a0\u5f3a\u4e861-Interval Connectivity\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u73b0\u6709\u4e0d\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u7ed3\u679c\uff1b\u7136\u540e\u8bc1\u660e\u5728Connectivity Time\u52a8\u6001\u56fe\u4e2d\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u4ee3\u7406\u5177\u6709\u5b8c\u5168\u7cfb\u7edf\u53c2\u6570\u77e5\u8bc6\u3001\u5168\u5c40\u901a\u4fe1\u3001\u5b8c\u5168\u53ef\u89c1\u6027\u548c\u65e0\u9650\u5185\u5b58\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528(n-1)(n-2)/2\u4e2a\u4ee3\u7406\u4e5f\u65e0\u6cd5\u5b8c\u6210\u63a2\u7d22\uff1b\u6700\u540e\u63d0\u51fa\u4f7f\u7528(n-1)(n-2)/2+1\u4e2a\u4ee3\u7406\u7684\u63a2\u7d22\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5047\u8bbe\u5168\u5c40\u901a\u4fe1\u30011\u8df3\u53ef\u89c1\u6027\u548cO(log n)\u5185\u5b58\u3002", "result": "1. \u52a0\u5f3a\u4e861-Interval Connectivity\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4e0d\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u7ed3\u679c\uff1b2. \u8bc1\u660e\u5728Connectivity Time\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528(n-1)(n-2)/2\u4e2a\u4ee3\u7406\u65e0\u6cd5\u5b8c\u6210\u63a2\u7d22\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u6539\u8fdb\u4e86\u5148\u524d\u5df2\u77e5\u7684n\u4e2a\u4ee3\u7406\u7684\u754c\u9650\uff1b3. \u8bc1\u660e\u8981\u4f7f\u7528(n-1)(n-2)/2+1\u4e2a\u4ee3\u7406\u89e3\u51b3\u63a2\u7d22\u95ee\u9898\uff0c1\u8df3\u53ef\u89c1\u6027\u662f\u5fc5\u8981\u7684\uff1b4. \u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4f7f\u7528(n-1)(n-2)/2+1\u4e2a\u4ee3\u7406\u7684\u63a2\u7d22\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u56fe\u63a2\u7d22\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u91cd\u8981\u8fdb\u5c55\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u6539\u8fdb\u4e86Connectivity Time\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u4e0d\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u754c\u9650\uff0c\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u63a5\u8fd1\u6700\u4f18\u7684\u63a2\u7d22\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e3a\u52a8\u6001\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u7684\u79fb\u52a8\u4ee3\u7406\u63a2\u7d22\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u7ed3\u679c\u3002"}}

However, their performance in synthesizing treasury futures data is still underexplored. This work emphasizes the characteristics of treasury futures data, including its low volume, market dependencies, and the grouped correlations among multivariables. To overcome these challenges, we propose TF-CoDiT, the first DiT framework for language-controlled treasury futures synthesis. To facilitate low-data learning, TF-CoDiT adapts the standard DiT by transforming multi-channel 1-D time series into Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) coefficient matrices. A U-shape VAE is proposed to encode cross-channel dependencies hierarchically into a latent variable and bridge the latent and DWT spaces through decoding, thereby enabling latent diffusion generation. To derive prompts that cover essential conditions, we introduce the Financial Market Attribute Protocol (FinMAP) - a multi-level description system that standardizes daily$/$periodical market dynamics by recognizing 17$/$23 economic indicators from 7/8 perspectives. In our experiments, we gather four types of treasury futures data covering the period from 2015 to 2025, and define data synthesis tasks with durations ranging from one week to four months. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that TF-CoDiT can produce highly authentic data with errors at most 0.433 (MSE) and 0.453 (MAE) to the ground-truth.

The traditional k-center problem, a fundamental theoretical challenge in clustering, has a best possible approximation ratio of 2, and any improvement to a ratio of 2 - \u03b5 would imply P = NP. In this work, we study the constrained k-center clustering problem, where instance-level cannot-link (CL) and must-link (ML) constraints are incorporated as background knowledge. Although general CL constraints significantly increase the hardness of approximation, previous work has shown that disjoint CL sets permit constant-factor approximations.

More precisely, different state-action pairs exhibit different degree of importance or difficulty which must be actively and explicitly built into a controlled exploration strategy. To this end, we propose a weighted and parameterized family of concave coverage objectives, denoted by $U_\u03c1$, defined directly over state--action occupancy measures. This family unifies several widely studied objectives within a single framework, including divergence-based marginal matching, weighted average coverage, and worst-case (minimax) coverage. While the concavity of $U_\u03c1$ captures the diminishing return associated with over-exploration, the simple closed form of the gradient of $U_\u03c1$ enables an explicit control to prioritize under-explored state--action pairs. Leveraging this structure, we develop a gradient-based algorithm that actively steers the induced occupancy toward a desired coverage pattern. Moreover, we show that as $\u03c1$ increases, the resulting exploration strategy increasingly emphasizes the least-explored state--action pairs, recovering worst-case coverage behavior in the limit.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u52a0\u6743\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u7684\u51f9\u8986\u76d6\u76ee\u6807\u65cfU_\u03c1\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u6307\u5bfc\u5956\u52b1\u65e0\u5173MDP\u4e2d\u7684\u5b9a\u5411\u63a2\u7d22\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u7edf\u4e00\u4e86\u591a\u79cd\u73b0\u6709\u8986\u76d6\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u5e76\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u68af\u5ea6\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\u4e3b\u52a8\u5f15\u5bfc\u5360\u7528\u5206\u5e03\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u5956\u52b1\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u51b3\u7b56\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\uff0c\u4e0d\u540c\u72b6\u6001-\u52a8\u4f5c\u5bf9\u5177\u6709\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u6216\u96be\u5ea6\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e3b\u52a8\u4e14\u663e\u5f0f\u5730\u6784\u5efa\u5230\u63a7\u5236\u63a2\u7d22\u7b56\u7565\u4e2d\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u5e73\u8861\u63a2\u7d22\u7684\u4f18\u5148\u7ea7\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u72b6\u6001-\u52a8\u4f5c\u5360\u7528\u6d4b\u5ea6\u7684\u52a0\u6743\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u51f9\u8986\u76d6\u76ee\u6807\u65cfU_\u03c1\uff0c\u8be5\u65cf\u7edf\u4e00\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u6563\u5ea6\u7684\u8fb9\u7f18\u5339\u914d\u3001\u52a0\u6743\u5e73\u5747\u8986\u76d6\u548c\u6700\u574f\u60c5\u51b5\u8986\u76d6\u7b49\u76ee\u6807\u3002\u5229\u7528U_\u03c1\u7684\u51f9\u6027\u548c\u68af\u5ea6\u95ed\u5f0f\u89e3\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u57fa\u4e8e\u68af\u5ea6\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\u4e3b\u52a8\u5f15\u5bfc\u5360\u7528\u5206\u5e03\u3002", "result": "U_\u03c1\u6846\u67b6\u6210\u529f\u7edf\u4e00\u4e86\u591a\u79cd\u8986\u76d6\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u5176\u68af\u5ea6\u95ed\u5f0f\u89e3\u4f7f\u5f97\u80fd\u591f\u663e\u5f0f\u63a7\u5236\u4f18\u5148\u63a2\u7d22\u672a\u5145\u5206\u63a2\u7d22\u7684\u72b6\u6001-\u52a8\u4f5c\u5bf9\u3002\u968f\u7740\u03c1\u589e\u5927\uff0c\u63a2\u7d22\u7b56\u7565\u8d8a\u6765\u8d8a\u5f3a\u8c03\u6700\u5c11\u63a2\u7d22\u7684\u72b6\u6001-\u52a8\u4f5c\u5bf9\uff0c\u5728\u6781\u9650\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u6062\u590d\u6700\u574f\u60c5\u51b5\u8986\u76d6\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u52a0\u6743\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u51f9\u8986\u76d6\u76ee\u6807\u65cfU_\u03c1\u4e3a\u5956\u52b1\u65e0\u5173MDP\u4e2d\u7684\u5b9a\u5411\u63a2\u7d22\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u901a\u8fc7\u68af\u5ea6\u7b97\u6cd5\u4e3b\u52a8\u5f15\u5bfc\u63a2\u7d22\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5e73\u8861\u4e0d\u540c\u72b6\u6001-\u52a8\u4f5c\u5bf9\u7684\u63a2\u7d22\u4f18\u5148\u7ea7\u3002"}}

This article presents a detailed analysis focused on quantifying and improving HPC resource utilization efficiency specifically within the LAGO computational environment. The core objective is to understand how LAGO's distinct computational workloads-characterized by a prevalent coarse-grained, task-parallel execution model-consume resources in practice. To achieve this, we analyze historical job accounting data from the EGI FedCloud platform, identifying primary workload categories (Monte Carlo simulations, data processing, user analysis/testing) and evaluating their performance using key efficiency metrics (CPU utilization, walltime utilization, and I/O patterns). Our analysis reveals significant patterns, including high CPU efficiency within individual simulation tasks contrasted with the distorting impact of short test jobs on aggregate metrics. This work pinpoints specific inefficiencies and provides data-driven insights into LAGO's HPC usage.

Orthogonal to prior work, which improved the reliability of IoT communication, our work focuses on improving the observability and programmability of IoT actions. We present the RASC (Request-Acknowledge-Start-Complete) abstraction, which provides acknowledgments at critical points after an IoT device action is initiated. RASC is a better fit for IoT actions, which naturally vary in length spatially (across devices) and temporally (across time, for a given device). RASC also enables the design of several new features: predicting action completion times accurately, detecting failures of actions faster, allowing fine-grained dependencies in programming, and scheduling. RASC is intended to be implemented atop today's available RPC mechanisms, rather than as a replacement. We integrated RASC into a popular and open-source IoT framework called Home Assistant. Our trace-driven evaluation finds that RASC meets latency SLOs, especially for long actions that last O(mins), which are common in smart spaces. Our scheduling policies for home automations (e.g., routines) outperform state-of-the-art counterparts by 10%-55%.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51faRASC\u62bd\u8c61\uff0c\u4e3a\u7269\u8054\u7f51\u8bbe\u5907\u64cd\u4f5c\u63d0\u4f9b\u8bf7\u6c42-\u786e\u8ba4-\u5f00\u59cb-\u5b8c\u6210\u56db\u9636\u6bb5\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u7269\u8054\u7f51\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u53ef\u89c2\u5bdf\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u7f16\u7a0b\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edfRPC\u867d\u7136\u6784\u6210\u7cfb\u7edf\u6808\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u4f46\u9762\u5bf9\u667a\u80fd\u5bb6\u5c45\u3001\u4ed3\u5e93\u3001\u529e\u516c\u697c\u7b49\u7528\u6237\u9762\u5411\u7684\u7269\u8054\u7f51\u8bbe\u5907\u96c6\u5408\u65f6\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u5bcc\u8868\u8fbe\u529b\u7684\u62bd\u8c61\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u5de5\u4f5c\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u7269\u8054\u7f51\u901a\u4fe1\u53ef\u9760\u6027\uff0c\u800c\u672c\u6587\u4e13\u6ce8\u4e8e\u63d0\u5347\u7269\u8054\u7f51\u64cd\u4f5c\u7684\u53ef\u89c2\u5bdf\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u7f16\u7a0b\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faRASC\uff08\u8bf7\u6c42-\u786e\u8ba4-\u5f00\u59cb-\u5b8c\u6210\uff09\u62bd\u8c61\uff0c\u5728\u7269\u8054\u7f51\u8bbe\u5907\u64cd\u4f5c\u542f\u52a8\u540e\u7684\u5173\u952e\u8282\u70b9\u63d0\u4f9b\u786e\u8ba4\u673a\u5236\u3002RASC\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e3a\u5728\u73b0\u6709RPC\u673a\u5236\u4e4b\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u800c\u975e\u66ff\u4ee3\u3002\u5c06RASC\u96c6\u6210\u5230\u5f00\u6e90\u7269\u8054\u7f51\u6846\u67b6Home Assistant\u4e2d\u3002", "result": "\u57fa\u4e8etrace\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u663e\u793aRASC\u6ee1\u8db3\u5ef6\u8fdfSLO\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5bf9\u4e8e\u6301\u7eed\u6570\u5206\u949f\u7684\u957f\u65f6\u95f4\u64cd\u4f5c\u3002\u5bb6\u5ead\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u8c03\u5ea6\u7b56\u7565\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u6700\u4f18\u65b9\u6848\u63d0\u534710%-55%\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "RASC\u62bd\u8c61\u66f4\u9002\u5408\u7269\u8054\u7f51\u64cd\u4f5c\u7684\u81ea\u7136\u65f6\u7a7a\u53d8\u5316\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u51c6\u786e\u9884\u6d4b\u64cd\u4f5c\u5b8c\u6210\u65f6\u95f4\u3001\u5feb\u901f\u68c0\u6d4b\u64cd\u4f5c\u5931\u8d25\u3001\u652f\u6301\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u4f9d\u8d56\u7f16\u7a0b\u548c\u8c03\u5ea6\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u7269\u8054\u7f51\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u53ef\u89c2\u5bdf\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u7f16\u7a0b\u6027\u3002"}}

For fair supervised learning, particularly in pre-processing, there have been two main categories: data fairness and task-tailored fairness. The former directly finds an intermediate distribution among the groups, independent of the type of the downstream model, so a learned downstream classification/regression model returns similar predictive scores to individuals inputting the same covariates irrespective of their sensitive attributes. The latter explicitly takes the supervised learning task into account when constructing the pre-processing map. In this work, we study algorithmic fairness for supervised learning and argue that the data fairness approaches impose overly strong regularization from the perspective of the HGR correlation. This motivates us to devise a novel pre-processing approach tailored to supervised learning. We account for the trade-off between fairness and utility in obtaining the pre-processing map. Then we study the behavior of arbitrary downstream supervised models learned on the transformed data to find sufficient conditions to guarantee their fairness improvement and utility preservation. To our knowledge, no prior work in the branch of task-tailored methods has theoretically investigated downstream guarantees when using pre-processed data. We further evaluate our framework through comparison studies based on tabular and image data sets, showing the superiority of our framework which preserves consistent trade-offs among multiple downstream models compared to recent competing models. Particularly for computer vision data, we see our method alters only necessary semantic features related to the central machine learning task to achieve fairness.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u9488\u5bf9\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u9884\u5904\u7406\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7HGR\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u5206\u6790\u53d1\u73b0\u73b0\u6709\u6570\u636e\u516c\u5e73\u65b9\u6cd5\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u8fc7\u5f3a\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4efb\u52a1\u5b9a\u5236\u5316\u9884\u5904\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\u5e73\u8861\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u4e0e\u6548\u7528\uff0c\u5e76\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u4e0b\u6e38\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u4fdd\u8bc1\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u9884\u5904\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\u5206\u4e3a\u4e24\u7c7b\uff1a\u6570\u636e\u516c\u5e73\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u72ec\u7acb\u4e8e\u4e0b\u6e38\u6a21\u578b\uff09\u548c\u4efb\u52a1\u5b9a\u5236\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u6570\u636e\u516c\u5e73\u65b9\u6cd5\u4eceHGR\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u89d2\u5ea6\u770b\u65bd\u52a0\u4e86\u8fc7\u5f3a\u7684\u6b63\u5219\u5316\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u8bbe\u8ba1\u66f4\u9002\u5408\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u9884\u5904\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u5b9a\u5236\u5316\u9884\u5904\u7406\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5728\u83b7\u53d6\u9884\u5904\u7406\u6620\u5c04\u65f6\u8003\u8651\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u4e0e\u6548\u7528\u7684\u6743\u8861\uff0c\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u4efb\u610f\u4e0b\u6e38\u76d1\u7763\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u53d8\u6362\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u627e\u5230\u4fdd\u8bc1\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u6539\u8fdb\u548c\u6548\u7528\u4fdd\u6301\u7684\u5145\u5206\u6761\u4ef6\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u8868\u683c\u548c\u56fe\u50cf\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u7ade\u4e89\u6a21\u578b\u5177\u6709\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\uff0c\u80fd\u4fdd\u6301\u591a\u4e2a\u4e0b\u6e38\u6a21\u578b\u95f4\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u6743\u8861\u3002\u7279\u522b\u5728\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u89c6\u89c9\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\uff0c\u4ec5\u6539\u53d8\u4e0e\u6838\u5fc3\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u4efb\u52a1\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u5fc5\u8981\u8bed\u4e49\u7279\u5f81\u6765\u5b9e\u73b0\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u5de5\u4f5c\u4e3a\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u9884\u5904\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u4fdd\u8bc1\uff0c\u9996\u6b21\u5728\u4efb\u52a1\u5b9a\u5236\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u5206\u652f\u4e2d\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u9884\u5904\u7406\u6570\u636e\u5bf9\u4e0b\u6e38\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4fdd\u8bc1\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u4e0e\u6548\u7528\u7684\u66f4\u597d\u5e73\u8861\u3002"}}

In compute-intensive scenarios, these models outperform the default Kubernetes scheduler as well as Transformer-and LSTM-based alternatives, reducing average CPU utilization per cluster node by 10%, and by over 20% when using SDQN-n. Moreover, our results show that SDQN-n approach of consolidating pods onto fewer nodes further amplifies resource savings and helps advance greener, more energy-efficient data centers.Therefore, pod scheduling must employ different strategies tailored to each scenario in order to achieve better performance.Since the reinforcement-learning components of the SDQN and SDQN-n architectures proposed in this paper can be easily tuned by adjusting their parameters, they can accommodate the requirements of various future scenarios.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e24\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7684Kubernetes\u8c03\u5ea6\u5668SDQN\u548cSDQN-n\uff0c\u5728\u8ba1\u7b97\u5bc6\u96c6\u578b\u5de5\u4f5c\u8d1f\u8f7d\u4e0b\u6bd4\u9ed8\u8ba4\u8c03\u5ea6\u5668\u6027\u80fd\u66f4\u597d\uff0c\u80fd\u964d\u4f4e\u96c6\u7fa4\u8282\u70b9CPU\u5229\u7528\u738710-20%\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u4e91\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u5bb9\u5668\u6280\u672f\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\uff0cDocker\u548cKubernetes\u6210\u4e3a\u4e3b\u6d41\u90e8\u7f72\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u4f46\u9ed8\u8ba4Kubernetes\u8c03\u5ea6\u5668\u5728\u5904\u7406\u8ba1\u7b97\u5bc6\u96c6\u578b\u5de5\u4f5c\u8d1f\u8f7d\uff08\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5bb9\u5668\u5316\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u8bad\u7ec3\uff09\u65f6\u65e0\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u6700\u4f18\u8c03\u5ea6\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e24\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6df1\u5ea6Q\u7f51\u7edc\uff08DQN\uff09\u6846\u67b6\u7684\u81ea\u5b9a\u4e49\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u8c03\u5ea6\u5668\uff1aSDQN\u548cSDQN-n\u3002SDQN-n\u91c7\u7528\u5c06pod\u6574\u5408\u5230\u66f4\u5c11\u8282\u70b9\u4e0a\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u8ba1\u7b97\u5bc6\u96c6\u578b\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\uff0cSDQN\u548cSDQN-n\u4f18\u4e8e\u9ed8\u8ba4Kubernetes\u8c03\u5ea6\u5668\u4ee5\u53ca\u57fa\u4e8eTransformer\u548cLSTM\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5e73\u5747\u964d\u4f4e\u96c6\u7fa4\u8282\u70b9CPU\u5229\u7528\u738710%\uff0cSDQN-n\u53ef\u964d\u4f4e\u8d85\u8fc720%\u3002", "conclusion": "pod\u8c03\u5ea6\u9700\u8981\u6839\u636e\u4e0d\u540c\u573a\u666f\u91c7\u7528\u5b9a\u5236\u7b56\u7565\u4ee5\u83b7\u5f97\u66f4\u597d\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u63d0\u51fa\u7684SDQN\u548cSDQN-n\u67b6\u6784\u4e2d\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7ec4\u4ef6\u53ef\u901a\u8fc7\u8c03\u6574\u53c2\u6570\u8f7b\u677e\u8c03\u4f18\uff0c\u9002\u5e94\u672a\u6765\u5404\u79cd\u573a\u666f\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u63a8\u8fdb\u66f4\u7eff\u8272\u3001\u66f4\u8282\u80fd\u7684\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u5fc3\u3002"}}

In each of $T$ rounds, each of $N$ agents selects an arm, the environment generates a clean reward vector, and an adversary perturbs the observed feedback subject to a global corruption budget $\u0393$. Performance is measured by team regret under a coordinate-wise nondecreasing, $L$-Lipschitz scalarization $\u03c6$, covering linear, Chebyshev, and smooth monotone utilities. Our main contribution is a communication-corruption coupling: we show that a fixed environment-side budget $\u0393$ can translate into an effective corruption level ranging from $\u0393$ to $N\u0393$, depending on whether agents share raw samples, sufficient statistics, or only arm recommendations. We formalize this via a protocol-induced multiplicity functional and prove regret bounds parameterized by the resulting effective corruption. As corollaries, raw-sample sharing can suffer an $N$-fold larger additive corruption penalty, whereas summary sharing and recommendation-only sharing preserve an unamplified $O(\u0393)$ term and achieve centralized-rate team regret. We further establish information-theoretic limits, including an unavoidable additive $\u03a9(\u0393)$ penalty and a high-corruption regime $\u0393=\u0398(NT)$ where sublinear regret is impossible without clean information. Finally, we characterize how a global budget $\u03bd$ of verified observations restores learnability. That is, verification is necessary in the high-corruption regime, and sufficient once it crosses the identification threshold, with certified sharing enabling the team's regret to become independent of $\u0393$.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u534f\u4f5c\u968f\u673a\u591a\u81c2\u8001\u864e\u673a\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u8003\u8651\u5411\u91cf\u5956\u52b1\u3001\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u8150\u8d25\u548c\u6709\u9650\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u901a\u4fe1\u534f\u8bae\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u8150\u8d25\u653e\u5927\u6548\u5e94", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u534f\u4f5c\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u901a\u4fe1-\u8150\u8d25\u8026\u5408\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63a2\u7d22\u4e0d\u540c\u901a\u4fe1\u534f\u8bae\uff08\u539f\u59cb\u6837\u672c\u5171\u4eab\u3001\u7edf\u8ba1\u6458\u8981\u5171\u4eab\u3001\u63a8\u8350\u5171\u4eab\uff09\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u8150\u8d25\u7684\u653e\u5927\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b9e\u9645\u90e8\u7f72\u63d0\u4f9b\u7406\u8bba\u6307\u5bfc", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u534f\u8bae\u8bf1\u5bfc\u7684\u591a\u91cd\u6027\u51fd\u6570\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u901a\u4fe1-\u8150\u8d25\u8026\u5408\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e0d\u540c\u901a\u4fe1\u534f\u8bae\u4e0b\u7684\u9057\u61be\u754c\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u4fe1\u606f\u8bba\u4e0b\u754c\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u9a8c\u8bc1\u89c2\u6d4b\u5982\u4f55\u6062\u590d\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u6027", "result": "\u539f\u59cb\u6837\u672c\u5171\u4eab\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4N\u500d\u8150\u8d25\u653e\u5927\uff0c\u800c\u6458\u8981\u5171\u4eab\u548c\u63a8\u8350\u5171\u4eab\u4fdd\u6301O(\u0393)\u8150\u8d25\u9879\u5e76\u8fbe\u5230\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316\u901f\u7387\uff1b\u9ad8\u8150\u8d25\u0393=\u0398(NT)\u4e0b\u65e0\u5e72\u51c0\u4fe1\u606f\u65e0\u6cd5\u83b7\u5f97\u6b21\u7ebf\u6027\u9057\u61be\uff1b\u9a8c\u8bc1\u89c2\u6d4b\u03bd\u8d85\u8fc7\u8bc6\u522b\u9608\u503c\u53ef\u6062\u590d\u5b66\u4e60\u80fd\u529b", "conclusion": "\u901a\u4fe1\u534f\u8bae\u9009\u62e9\u5bf9\u8150\u8d25\u653e\u5927\u6709\u51b3\u5b9a\u6027\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5728\u6781\u7aef\u8150\u8d25\u4e0b\u662f\u5fc5\u8981\u7684\uff0c\u8ba4\u8bc1\u5171\u4eab\u53ef\u4f7f\u56e2\u961f\u9057\u61be\u72ec\u7acb\u4e8e\u8150\u8d25\u9884\u7b97\u0393"}}

Building on this architecture, we introduce a curriculum optimization protocol that progressively increases circuit depth and transitions from SPSA-based stochastic exploration to Adam-based gradient fine-tuning. We evaluate the approach on PDE-informed regression benchmarks and standard regression datasets under a fixed training budget in a simulator setting. Empirically, the proposed framework consistently improves over pure QNN baselines and yields more stable convergence in data-limited regimes.

However, existing CRL algorithms often encounter significant constraint violations during training, limiting their applicability in safety-critical scenarios. In this paper, we identify the underestimation of the cost value function as a key factor contributing to these violations. To address this issue, we propose the Memory-driven Intrinsic Cost Estimation (MICE) method, which introduces intrinsic costs to mitigate underestimation and control bias to promote safer exploration. Inspired by flashbulb memory, where humans vividly recall dangerous experiences to avoid risks, MICE constructs a memory module that stores previously explored unsafe states to identify high-cost regions. The intrinsic cost is formulated as the pseudo-count of the current state visiting these risk regions. Furthermore, we propose an extrinsic-intrinsic cost value function that incorporates intrinsic costs and adopts a bias correction strategy. Using this function, we formulate an optimization objective within the trust region, along with corresponding optimization methods. Theoretically, we provide convergence guarantees for the proposed cost value function and establish the worst-case constraint violation for the MICE update. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MICE significantly reduces constraint violations while preserving policy performance comparable to baselines.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faMICE\u65b9\u6cd5\u89e3\u51b3\u7ea6\u675f\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u6210\u672c\u51fd\u6570\u4f4e\u4f30\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8bb0\u5fc6\u6a21\u5757\u5b58\u50a8\u5371\u9669\u72b6\u6001\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u5185\u5728\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u7ea6\u675f\u8fdd\u53cd\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u7b56\u7565\u6027\u80fd", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7ea6\u675f\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7ecf\u5e38\u51fa\u73b0\u4e25\u91cd\u7684\u7ea6\u675f\u8fdd\u53cd\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u5b89\u5168\u5173\u952e\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u3002\u4f5c\u8005\u53d1\u73b0\u6210\u672c\u4ef7\u503c\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u4f4e\u4f30\u662f\u5bfc\u81f4\u8fd9\u4e9b\u8fdd\u53cd\u7684\u5173\u952e\u56e0\u7d20\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u8bb0\u5fc6\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u5185\u5728\u6210\u672c\u4f30\u8ba1\uff08MICE\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a1\uff09\u6784\u5efa\u8bb0\u5fc6\u6a21\u5757\u5b58\u50a8\u5148\u524d\u63a2\u7d22\u7684\u4e0d\u5b89\u5168\u72b6\u6001\u4ee5\u8bc6\u522b\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u533a\u57df\uff1b2\uff09\u5c06\u5185\u5728\u6210\u672c\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e3a\u5f53\u524d\u72b6\u6001\u8bbf\u95ee\u8fd9\u4e9b\u98ce\u9669\u533a\u57df\u7684\u4f2a\u8ba1\u6570\uff1b3\uff09\u63d0\u51fa\u7ed3\u5408\u5185\u5728\u6210\u672c\u7684\u5916\u5728-\u5185\u5728\u6210\u672c\u4ef7\u503c\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u504f\u5dee\u6821\u6b63\u7b56\u7565\uff1b4\uff09\u5728\u4fe1\u4efb\u533a\u57df\u5185\u5236\u5b9a\u4f18\u5316\u76ee\u6807\u53ca\u76f8\u5e94\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660eMICE\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u7ea6\u675f\u8fdd\u53cd\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u4e0e\u57fa\u7ebf\u76f8\u5f53\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6210\u672c\u4ef7\u503c\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u6536\u655b\u4fdd\u8bc1\uff0c\u5e76\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86MICE\u66f4\u65b0\u7684\u6700\u574f\u60c5\u51b5\u7ea6\u675f\u8fdd\u53cd\u754c\u9650\u3002", "conclusion": "MICE\u901a\u8fc7\u89e3\u51b3\u6210\u672c\u4ef7\u503c\u51fd\u6570\u4f4e\u4f30\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u7ea6\u675f\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\uff0c\u4f7f\u5176\u66f4\u9002\u5408\u5b89\u5168\u5173\u952e\u5e94\u7528\u573a\u666f\u3002"}}

Traditional approaches typically pre-train models using dynamic link prediction and directly apply the resulting node temporal embeddings to specific downstream tasks. However, the significant differences among downstream tasks often lead to performance degradation, especially under few-shot settings. Prompt tuning has emerged as an effective solution to this problem. Existing prompting methods are often strongly coupled with specific model architectures or pretraining tasks, which makes it difficult to adapt to recent or future model designs. Moreover, their exclusive focus on modifying node or temporal features while neglecting spatial structural information leads to limited expressiveness and degraded performance. To address these limitations, we propose DDGPrompt, a data-centric prompting framework designed to effectively refine pre-trained node embeddings at the input data level, enabling better adaptability to diverse downstream tasks. We first define a unified node expression feature matrix that aggregates all relevant temporal and structural information of each node, ensuring compatibility with a wide range of dynamic graph models. Then, we introduce three prompt matrices (temporal bias, edge weight, and feature mask) to adjust the feature matrix completely, achieving task-specific adaptation of node embeddings. We evaluate DDGPrompt under a strict few-shot setting on four public dynamic graph datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms traditional methods and prompting approaches in scenarios with limited labels and cold-start conditions.", "AI": {"tldr": "DDGPrompt\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u9762\u5411\u52a8\u6001\u56fe\u7684\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316\u63d0\u793a\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8c03\u6574\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u8282\u70b9\u5d4c\u5165\u6765\u9002\u5e94\u4e0d\u540c\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u5728\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u548c\u51b7\u542f\u52a8\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u52a8\u6001\u56fe\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u94fe\u63a5\u9884\u6d4b\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u5c06\u8282\u70b9\u65f6\u95f4\u5d4c\u5165\u76f4\u63a5\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u3002\u4f46\u7531\u4e8e\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u5dee\u5f02\u5927\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u660e\u663e\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u63d0\u793a\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u4e0e\u7279\u5b9a\u6a21\u578b\u67b6\u6784\u6216\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u4efb\u52a1\u5f3a\u8026\u5408\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u9002\u5e94\u65b0\u6a21\u578b\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u4e14\u53ea\u5173\u6ce8\u4fee\u6539\u8282\u70b9\u6216\u65f6\u95f4\u7279\u5f81\u800c\u5ffd\u7565\u7a7a\u95f4\u7ed3\u6784\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\u6709\u9650\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faDDGPrompt\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1\uff09\u5b9a\u4e49\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u8282\u70b9\u8868\u8fbe\u7279\u5f81\u77e9\u9635\uff0c\u805a\u5408\u6bcf\u4e2a\u8282\u70b9\u7684\u6240\u6709\u76f8\u5173\u65f6\u95f4\u548c\u7ed3\u6784\u4fe1\u606f\uff1b2\uff09\u5f15\u5165\u4e09\u4e2a\u63d0\u793a\u77e9\u9635\uff08\u65f6\u95f4\u504f\u7f6e\u3001\u8fb9\u6743\u91cd\u548c\u7279\u5f81\u63a9\u7801\uff09\u6765\u5b8c\u5168\u8c03\u6574\u7279\u5f81\u77e9\u9635\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u8282\u70b9\u5d4c\u5165\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u5b9a\u9002\u5e94\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u56db\u4e2a\u516c\u5171\u52a8\u6001\u56fe\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u4e25\u683c\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6807\u7b7e\u6709\u9650\u548c\u51b7\u542f\u52a8\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u73b0\u6709\u63d0\u793a\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "DDGPrompt\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u6709\u6548\u7684\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316\u63d0\u793a\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u901a\u8fc7\u8c03\u6574\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u8282\u70b9\u5d4c\u5165\u6765\u9002\u5e94\u591a\u6837\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u5728\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u548c\u51b7\u542f\u52a8\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\u3002"}}

Federated Learning (FL) enables local-data training, yet existing methods either rely on memory-intensive backpropagation or use zeroth-order optimization (ZOO), which avoids backward passes but suffers from slow convergence and degraded accuracy. We propose CooperLLM, a cloud-assisted edge-end cooperative federated fine-tuning framework that combines ZOO on mobile devices with cloud-guided gradient rectification. Mobile clients perform lightweight ZOO updates on private data, while the cloud fine-tunes on auxiliary public data using backpropagation and injects guided perturbations to rectify local updates, improving convergence and accuracy without violating privacy. To address system bottlenecks, CooperLLM introduces pipeline scheduling and adaptive compression to overlap computation and communication and reduce memory usage. Experiments on multiple Transformer models and datasets show that CooperLLM reduces on-device memory by up to $86.4\\%$, accelerates convergence by $8.8 \\times$, and improves accuracy by up to 10 percentage points over state-of-the-art ZOO-based baselines.", "AI": {"tldr": "CooperLLM\uff1a\u4e91\u8f85\u52a9\u7684\u8fb9\u7aef\u534f\u540c\u8054\u90a6\u5fae\u8c03\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u79fb\u52a8\u8bbe\u5907\u4e0a\u7684\u96f6\u9636\u4f18\u5316\u548c\u4e91\u7aef\u68af\u5ea6\u6821\u6b63\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u5185\u5b58\u5360\u7528\u3001\u52a0\u901f\u6536\u655b\u5e76\u63d0\u5347\u7cbe\u5ea6", "motivation": "\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u79fb\u52a8\u8bbe\u5907\u4e0a\u5fae\u8c03\u9762\u4e34\u9ad8\u5185\u5b58\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u800c\u73b0\u6709\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u8981\u4e48\u4f9d\u8d56\u5185\u5b58\u5bc6\u96c6\u578b\u53cd\u5411\u4f20\u64ad\uff0c\u8981\u4e48\u4f7f\u7528\u6536\u655b\u6162\u3001\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4f4e\u7684\u96f6\u9636\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5", "method": "\u63d0\u51faCooperLLM\u6846\u67b6\uff1a\u79fb\u52a8\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u5728\u79c1\u6709\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u6267\u884c\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u96f6\u9636\u4f18\u5316\u66f4\u65b0\uff0c\u4e91\u7aef\u5728\u8f85\u52a9\u516c\u5171\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u4f7f\u7528\u53cd\u5411\u4f20\u64ad\u5fae\u8c03\u5e76\u6ce8\u5165\u5f15\u5bfc\u6270\u52a8\u6765\u6821\u6b63\u672c\u5730\u66f4\u65b0\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u91c7\u7528\u6d41\u6c34\u7ebf\u8c03\u5ea6\u548c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u538b\u7f29\u6280\u672f\u4f18\u5316\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u80fd", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2aTransformer\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cCooperLLM\u5c06\u8bbe\u5907\u5185\u5b58\u964d\u4f4e\u9ad8\u8fbe86.4%\uff0c\u52a0\u901f\u6536\u655b8.8\u500d\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u96f6\u9636\u4f18\u5316\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u7cbe\u5ea6\u63d0\u5347\u9ad8\u8fbe10\u4e2a\u767e\u5206\u70b9", "conclusion": "CooperLLM\u901a\u8fc7\u4e91\u8f85\u52a9\u7684\u8fb9\u7aef\u534f\u540c\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u79fb\u52a8\u8bbe\u5907\u4e0a\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8054\u90a6\u5fae\u8c03\u7684\u5185\u5b58\u3001\u6536\u655b\u548c\u7cbe\u5ea6\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u4e0b\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u4e2a\u6027\u5316"}}

Traditional forecasting methods require significant expert knowledge and struggle to generalize across diverse deployment scenarios. Recent advancements in pre-trained time series models offer new opportunities, but their zero-shot performance on domain-specific tasks remains limited. To address these challenges, we propose a novel MoE Encoder module that augments pretrained forecasting models by injecting a sparse mixture-of-experts layer between tokenization and encoding. This design enables two key capabilities: (1) trans forming multivariate forecasting into an expert-guided univariate task, allowing the model to effectively capture inter-variable relations, and (2) supporting localized training and lightweight parameter sharing in federated settings where raw data cannot be exchanged. Extensive experiments on public multivariate datasets demonstrate that MoE-Encoder significantly improves forecasting accuracy compared to strong baselines.

Constrained Reinforcement Learning (CRL) addresses this by maximizing returns under predefined constraints, typically formulated as the expected cumulative cost. However, expectation-based constraints overlook rare but high-impact extreme value events in the tail distribution, such as black swan incidents, which can lead to severe constraint violations. To address this issue, we propose the Extreme Value policy Optimization (EVO) algorithm, leveraging Extreme Value Theory (EVT) to model and exploit extreme reward and cost samples, reducing constraint violations. EVO introduces an extreme quantile optimization objective to explicitly capture extreme samples in the cost tail distribution. Additionally, we propose an extreme prioritization mechanism during replay, amplifying the learning signal from rare but high-impact extreme samples. Theoretically, we establish upper bounds on expected constraint violations during policy updates, guaranteeing strict constraint satisfaction at a zero-violation quantile level. Further, we demonstrate that EVO achieves a lower probability of constraint violations than expectation-based methods and exhibits lower variance than quantile regression methods. Extensive experiments show that EVO significantly reduces constraint violations during training while maintaining competitive policy performance compared to baselines.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faEVO\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u6781\u503c\u7406\u8bba\u5904\u7406\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u6781\u7aef\u98ce\u9669\u4e8b\u4ef6\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u7ea6\u675f\u8fdd\u53cd", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u7ea6\u675f\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u57fa\u4e8e\u671f\u671b\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u5c3e\u90e8\u5206\u5e03\u4e2d\u7684\u7f55\u89c1\u4f46\u9ad8\u5f71\u54cd\u6781\u7aef\u4e8b\u4ef6\uff08\u5982\u9ed1\u5929\u9e45\u4e8b\u4ef6\uff09\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u4e25\u91cd\u7ea6\u675f\u8fdd\u53cd", "method": "\u63d0\u51faEVO\u7b97\u6cd5\uff1a1\uff09\u5f15\u5165\u6781\u7aef\u5206\u4f4d\u6570\u4f18\u5316\u76ee\u6807\u6355\u6349\u6210\u672c\u5c3e\u90e8\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u6781\u7aef\u6837\u672c\uff1b2\uff09\u63d0\u51fa\u6781\u7aef\u4f18\u5148\u91cd\u653e\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u653e\u5927\u7f55\u89c1\u4f46\u9ad8\u5f71\u54cd\u6781\u7aef\u6837\u672c\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u4fe1\u53f7\uff1b3\uff09\u57fa\u4e8e\u6781\u503c\u7406\u8bba\u5efa\u6a21\u548c\u5229\u7528\u6781\u7aef\u5956\u52b1\u548c\u6210\u672c\u6837\u672c", "result": "\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u7b56\u7565\u66f4\u65b0\u671f\u95f4\u9884\u671f\u7ea6\u675f\u8fdd\u53cd\u7684\u4e0a\u754c\uff0c\u4fdd\u8bc1\u5728\u96f6\u8fdd\u53cd\u5206\u4f4d\u6570\u6c34\u5e73\u7684\u4e25\u683c\u7ea6\u675f\u6ee1\u8db3\uff1b\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660eEVO\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u8bad\u7ec3\u671f\u95f4\u7684\u7ea6\u675f\u8fdd\u53cd\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e0e\u57fa\u7ebf\u76f8\u5f53\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u6027\u80fd", "conclusion": "EVO\u7b97\u6cd5\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u5904\u7406\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u6781\u7aef\u98ce\u9669\u4e8b\u4ef6\uff0c\u6bd4\u57fa\u4e8e\u671f\u671b\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u4f4e\u7684\u7ea6\u675f\u8fdd\u53cd\u6982\u7387\uff0c\u6bd4\u5206\u4f4d\u6570\u56de\u5f52\u65b9\u6cd5\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u4f4e\u7684\u65b9\u5dee"}}

While it fails to alter the terminal learning phase in overparameterized deep neural networks (DNNs) trained on high-dimensional datasets, empirical evidence consistently shows it offers significant benefits early in training. To transparently demonstrate and analyze this phenomenon, we introduce a small-scale model (SSM). This model is specifically designed to abstract the inherent complexities of both the DNN architecture and the input data, while maintaining key information about the structure of imbalance within its spectral components. On the one hand, the SSM reveals how vanilla empirical risk minimization preferentially learns to distinguish majority classes over minorities early in training, consequently delaying minority learning.

Substantially extending our preliminary conference version, we present FactoST-v2, an enhanced factorized framework redesigned for full weight transfer and arbitrary-length generalization. FactoST-v2 decouples universal temporal learning from domain-specific spatial adaptation. The first stage pretrains a minimalist encoder-only backbone using randomized sequence masking to capture invariant temporal dynamics, enabling probabilistic quantile prediction across variable horizons. The second stage employs a streamlined adapter to rapidly inject spatial awareness via meta adaptive learning and prompting. Comprehensive evaluations across diverse domains demonstrate that FactoST-v2 achieves state-of-the-art accuracy with linear efficiency - significantly outperforming existing foundation models in zero-shot and few-shot scenarios while rivaling domain-specific expert baselines.

Answering this question requires rigorous evaluation and effective mitigation, but existing approaches fall short on both fronts: evaluation methods force outputs into predefined cultural categories without a neutral option, while mitigation relies on expensive multi-cultural corpora or agent frameworks that use functional roles (e.g., Planner--Critique) lacking explicit cultural representation. To address these gaps, we introduce CEBiasBench, a Chinese--English bilingual benchmark, and Multi-Agent Vote (MAV), which enables explicit ``no bias'' judgments. Using this framework, we find that Chinese prompting merely shifts bias toward East Asian perspectives rather than eliminating it. To mitigate such persistent bias, we propose Multi-Agent Cultural Debate (MACD), a training-free framework that assigns agents distinct cultural personas and orchestrates deliberation via a \"Seeking Common Ground while Reserving Differences\" strategy. Experiments demonstrate that MACD achieves 57.6% average No Bias Rate evaluated by LLM-as-judge and 86.0% evaluated by MAV (vs. 47.6% and 69.0% baseline using GPT-4o as backbone) on CEBiasBench and generalizes to the Arabic CAMeL benchmark, confirming that explicit cultural representation in agent frameworks is essential for cross-cultural fairness.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u9488\u5bf9LLM\u5b58\u5728\u7684\u897f\u65b9\u4e2d\u5fc3\u504f\u89c1\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86CEBiasBench\u4e2d\u82f1\u53cc\u8bed\u57fa\u51c6\u548cMulti-Agent Cultural Debate\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u4e2d\u6587\u63d0\u793a\u4ec5\u5c06\u504f\u89c1\u8f6c\u5411\u4e1c\u4e9a\u89c6\u89d2\u800c\u975e\u6d88\u9664\uff0c\u800cMACD\u901a\u8fc7\u8d4b\u4e88\u4ee3\u7406\u4e0d\u540c\u6587\u5316\u89d2\u8272\u5e76\u91c7\u7528\"\u6c42\u540c\u5b58\u5f02\"\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u65e0\u504f\u89c1\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5b58\u5728\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u897f\u65b9\u4e2d\u5fc3\u504f\u89c1\uff0c\u4f46\u4f7f\u7528\u975e\u897f\u65b9\u8bed\u8a00\uff08\u5982\u4e2d\u6587\uff09\u63d0\u793a\u80fd\u5426\u7f13\u89e3\u8fd9\u79cd\u504f\u89c1\u5c1a\u672a\u5145\u5206\u7814\u7a76\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u4e0d\u8db3\uff1a\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u5f3a\u5236\u8f93\u51fa\u5230\u9884\u5b9a\u4e49\u7684\u6587\u5316\u7c7b\u522b\u4e14\u7f3a\u4e4f\u4e2d\u7acb\u9009\u9879\uff1b\u7f13\u89e3\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u6602\u8d35\u7684\u591a\u6587\u5316\u8bed\u6599\u5e93\u6216\u4f7f\u7528\u7f3a\u4e4f\u660e\u786e\u6587\u5316\u8868\u5f81\u7684\u529f\u80fd\u89d2\u8272\u4ee3\u7406\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "1) \u63d0\u51faCEBiasBench\u4e2d\u82f1\u53cc\u8bed\u57fa\u51c6\uff1b2) \u5f15\u5165Multi-Agent Vote(MAV)\u652f\u6301\u660e\u786e\u7684\"\u65e0\u504f\u89c1\"\u5224\u65ad\uff1b3) \u63d0\u51faMulti-Agent Cultural Debate(MACD)\u8bad\u7ec3\u514d\u8d39\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4e3a\u4ee3\u7406\u5206\u914d\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u6587\u5316\u89d2\u8272\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\"\u6c42\u540c\u5b58\u5f02\"\u7b56\u7565\u534f\u8c03\u8fa9\u8bba\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u53d1\u73b0\u4e2d\u6587\u63d0\u793a\u4ec5\u5c06\u504f\u89c1\u8f6c\u5411\u4e1c\u4e9a\u89c6\u89d2\u800c\u975e\u6d88\u9664\u504f\u89c1\u3002MACD\u5728CEBiasBench\u4e0a\u901a\u8fc7LLM-as-judge\u8bc4\u4f30\u8fbe\u523057.6%\u5e73\u5747\u65e0\u504f\u89c1\u7387\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7MAV\u8bc4\u4f30\u8fbe\u523086.0%\uff08\u4f7f\u7528GPT-4o\u4f5c\u4e3a\u9aa8\u5e72\u7684\u57fa\u7ebf\u5206\u522b\u4e3a47.6%\u548c69.0%\uff09\u3002MACD\u8fd8\u80fd\u63a8\u5e7f\u5230\u963f\u62c9\u4f2f\u8bedCAMeL\u57fa\u51c6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5728\u4ee3\u7406\u6846\u67b6\u4e2d\u660e\u786e\u7684\u6587\u5316\u8868\u5f81\u5bf9\u4e8e\u8de8\u6587\u5316\u516c\u5e73\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002MACD\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u6587\u5316\u89d2\u8272\u5206\u914d\u548c\"\u6c42\u540c\u5b58\u5f02\"\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u4e86LLM\u7684\u6587\u5316\u504f\u89c1\uff0c\u4e14\u65e0\u9700\u989d\u5916\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002"}}

Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have emerged as a powerful solution that embeds physical laws in training by enforcing equation residuals. However, these struggle to model nonlinear dynamics, suffering from limited generalization across problems and long training times. To address these limitations, we propose a perturbation-guided transfer learning framework for PINNs (PTL-PINN), which integrates perturbation theory with transfer learning to efficiently solve nonlinear equations. Unlike gradient-based transfer learning, PTL-PINNs solve an approximate linear perturbative system using closed-form expressions, enabling rapid generalization with the time complexity of matrix-vector multiplication. We show that PTL-PINNs achieve accuracy comparable to various Runge-Kutta methods, with computational speeds up to one order of magnitude faster. To benchmark performance, we solve a broad set of problems, including nonlinear oscillators across various damping regimes, the equilibrium-centered Lotka-Volterra system, the KPP-Fisher and the Wave equation. Since perturbation theory sets the accuracy bound of PTL-PINNs, we systematically evaluate its practical applicability.

To mitigate these problems, we propose using embedding vectors for numbers instead of directly using their raw values. These embeddings aim to retain essential algebraic properties while preventing numerical instabilities. In this paper, we introduce, for the first time, a fixed-length number embedding vector that preserves algebraic operations, including addition, multiplication, and comparison, within the field of rational numbers. We propose a novel Neural Isomorphic Field, a neural abstraction of algebraic structures such as groups and fields. The elements of this neural field are embedding vectors that maintain algebraic structure during computations. Our experiments demonstrate that addition performs exceptionally well, achieving over 95 percent accuracy on key algebraic tests such as identity, closure, and associativity. In contrast, multiplication exhibits challenges, with accuracy ranging from 53 percent to 73 percent across various algebraic properties.

A major challenge is the absence of accessible benchmark datasets for evaluating privacy risks, due to difficulties in acquiring sensitive data. To address this, we introduce SynQP, an open framework for benchmarking privacy in synthetic data generation (SDG) using simulated sensitive data, ensuring that original data remains confidential. We also highlight the need for privacy metrics that fairly account for the probabilistic nature of machine learning models. As a demonstration, we use SynQP to benchmark CTGAN and propose a new identity disclosure risk metric that offers a more accurate estimation of privacy risks compared to existing approaches. Our work provides a critical tool for improving the transparency and reliability of privacy evaluations, enabling safer use of synthetic data in health-related applications. % In our quality evaluations, non-private models achieved near-perfect machine-learning efficacy \\(\\ge0.97\\). Our privacy assessments (Table II) reveal that DP consistently lowers both identity disclosure risk (SD-IDR) and membership-inference attack risk (SD-MIA), with all DP-augmented models staying below the 0.09 regulatory threshold.

However, MoE models are plagued by two fundamental challenges: 1) a load imbalance problem known as the``rich get richer\" phenomenon, where a few experts are over-utilized, and 2) an expert homogeneity problem, where experts learn redundant representations, negating their purpose. Current solutions typically employ an auxiliary load-balancing loss that, while mitigating imbalance, often exacerbates homogeneity by enforcing uniform routing at the expense of specialization. To resolve this, we introduce the Eigen-Mixture-of-Experts (EMoE), a novel architecture that leverages a routing mechanism based on a learned orthonormal eigenbasis. EMoE projects input tokens onto this shared eigenbasis and routes them based on their alignment with the principal components of the feature space. This principled, geometric partitioning of data intrinsically promotes both balanced expert utilization and the development of diverse, specialized experts, all without the need for a conflicting auxiliary loss function.

We tackle these problems with Threshold Differential Attention (TDA), a sink-free attention mechanism that achieves ultra-sparsity and improved robustness at longer sequence lengths without the computational overhead of projection methods or the performance degradation caused by noise accumulation of standard rectified attention. TDA applies row-wise extreme-value thresholding with a length-dependent gate, retaining only exceedances. Inspired by the differential transformer, TDA also subtracts an inhibitory view to enhance expressivity. Theoretically, we prove that TDA controls the expected number of spurious survivors per row to $O(1)$ and that consensus spurious matches across independent views vanish as context grows.

Shi", "Haipeng Chen"], "title": "Speculative Sampling with Reinforcement Learning", "comment": "Accepted to AAAI 2026", "summary": "Inference time latency has remained an open challenge for real world applications of large language models (LLMs). State-of-the-art (SOTA) speculative sampling (SpS) methods for LLMs, like EAGLE-3, use tree-based drafting to explore multiple candidate continuations in parallel. However, the hyperparameters controlling the tree structure are static, which limits flexibility and efficiency across diverse contexts and domains. We introduce Reinforcement learning for Speculative Sampling (Re-SpS), the first reinforcement learning (RL)-based framework for draft tree hyperparameter optimization. Re-SpS dynamically adjusts draft tree hyperparameters in real-time, learning context-aware policies that maximize generation speed by balancing speculative aggression with computational overhead. It leverages efficient state representations from target model hidden states and introduces multi-step action persistence for better context modeling.

In this paper, we revisit this problem in an ultra-sparse sampling regime, where each entry of an unknown, $n\\times d$ matrix $M$ (with $n \\ge d$) is observed independently with probability $p = C / d$, for a fixed integer $C \\ge 2$. This setting is motivated by applications involving large, sparse panel datasets, where the number of rows far exceeds the number of columns. When each row contains only $C$ entries -- fewer than the rank of $M$ -- accurate imputation of $M$ is impossible. Instead, we estimate the row span of $M$ or the averaged second-moment matrix $T = M^{\\top} M / n$.\n  The empirical second-moment matrix computed from observed entries exhibits non-random and sparse missingness. We propose an unbiased estimator that normalizes each nonzero entry of the second moment by its observed frequency, followed by gradient descent to impute the missing entries of $T$. The normalization divides a weighted sum of $n$ binomial random variables by the total number of ones. We show that the estimator is unbiased for any $p$ and enjoys low variance. When the row vectors of $M$ are drawn uniformly from a rank-$r$ factor model satisfying an incoherence condition, we prove that if $n \\ge O({d r^5 \u03b5^{-2} C^{-2} \\log d})$, any local minimum of the gradient-descent objective is approximately global and recovers $T$ with error at most $\u03b5^2$.\n  Experiments on both synthetic and real-world data validate our approach. On three MovieLens datasets, our algorithm reduces bias by $88\\%$ relative to baseline estimators. We also empirically validate the linear sampling complexity of $n$ relative to $d$ on synthetic data. On an Amazon reviews dataset with sparsity $10^{-7}$, our method reduces the recovery error of $T$ by $59\\%$ and $M$ by $38\\%$ compared to baseline methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u8d85\u7a00\u758f\u91c7\u6837\u4e0b\u7684\u77e9\u9635\u8865\u5168\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u504f\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\u6765\u6062\u590d\u77e9\u9635\u7684\u884c\u7a7a\u95f4\u6216\u4e8c\u9636\u77e9\u77e9\u9635\uff0c\u5728\u884c\u6570\u8fdc\u5927\u4e8e\u5217\u6570\u7684\u7a00\u758f\u9762\u677f\u6570\u636e\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u77e9\u9635\u8865\u5168\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u8d85\u7a00\u758f\u91c7\u6837\uff08\u6bcf\u4e2a\u6761\u76ee\u72ec\u7acb\u89c2\u6d4b\u6982\u7387p=C/d\uff0cC\u22652\uff09\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u5931\u6548\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5f53\u6bcf\u884c\u53ea\u6709C\u4e2a\u89c2\u6d4b\u503c\uff08\u5c11\u4e8e\u77e9\u9635\u79e9\uff09\u65f6\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u51c6\u786e\u8865\u5168\u77e9\u9635\u3002\u9700\u8981\u7814\u7a76\u5982\u4f55\u5728\u8fd9\u79cd\u6781\u7aef\u7a00\u758f\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u4f30\u8ba1\u77e9\u9635\u7684\u884c\u7a7a\u95f4\u6216\u4e8c\u9636\u77e9\u77e9\u9635\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u65e0\u504f\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\uff1a\u9996\u5148\u5bf9\u4e8c\u9636\u77e9\u77e9\u9635\u7684\u975e\u96f6\u6761\u76ee\u6309\u89c2\u6d4b\u9891\u7387\u8fdb\u884c\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u5904\u7406\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u4f7f\u7528\u68af\u5ea6\u4e0b\u964d\u6cd5\u8865\u5168\u4e8c\u9636\u77e9\u77e9\u9635\u7684\u7f3a\u5931\u6761\u76ee\u3002\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5c06n\u4e2a\u4e8c\u9879\u968f\u673a\u53d8\u91cf\u7684\u52a0\u6743\u548c\u9664\u4ee5\u603b\u89c2\u6d4b\u6570\u3002", "result": "\u7406\u8bba\u8bc1\u660e\uff1a\u5f53\u77e9\u9635\u884c\u5411\u91cf\u6765\u81ea\u6ee1\u8db3\u4e0d\u76f8\u5e72\u6761\u4ef6\u7684\u79e9r\u56e0\u5b50\u6a21\u578b\u65f6\uff0c\u82e5n\u2265O(dr\u2075\u03b5\u207b\u00b2C\u207b\u00b2log d)\uff0c\u68af\u5ea6\u4e0b\u964d\u7684\u4efb\u610f\u5c40\u90e8\u6700\u5c0f\u503c\u90fd\u8fd1\u4f3c\u5168\u5c40\u6700\u4f18\uff0c\u80fd\u4ee5\u8bef\u5dee\u81f3\u591a\u03b5\u00b2\u6062\u590d\u4e8c\u9636\u77e9\u77e9\u9635T\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff1a\u5728MovieLens\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u504f\u5dee\u51cf\u5c1188%\uff0c\u5728\u7a00\u758f\u5ea610\u207b\u2077\u7684Amazon\u8bc4\u8bba\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cT\u7684\u6062\u590d\u8bef\u5dee\u51cf\u5c1159%\uff0cM\u7684\u6062\u590d\u8bef\u5dee\u51cf\u5c1138%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u8d85\u7a00\u758f\u91c7\u6837\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u77e9\u9635\u884c\u7a7a\u95f4\u548c\u4e8c\u9636\u77e9\u77e9\u9635\u7684\u4f30\u8ba1\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u548c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5747\u8868\u660e\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u7a00\u758f\u9762\u677f\u6570\u636e\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u52bf\u3002"}}

While recent progress has been made in large-scale pretraining, most approaches overlook the spectral structure of photoplethysmography (PPG) signals, wherein physiological rhythms unfold across multiple frequency bands. Motivated by the insight that many downstream health-related tasks depend on multi-resolution features spanning fine-grained waveform morphology to global rhythmic dynamics, we introduce Masked Multiscale Reconstruction (MMR) for PPG representation learning - a self-supervised pretraining framework that explicitly learns from hierarchical time-frequency scales of PPG data. The pretraining task is designed to reconstruct randomly masked out coefficients obtained from a wavelet-based multiresolution decomposition of PPG signals, forcing the transformer encoder to integrate information across temporal and spectral scales. We pretrain our model with MMR using ~17 million unlabeled 10-second PPG segments from ~32,000 smartwatch users. On 17 of 19 diverse health-related tasks, MMR trained on large-scale wearable PPG data improves over or matches state-of-the-art open-source PPG foundation models, time-series foundation models, and other self-supervised baselines. Extensive analysis of our learned embeddings and systematic ablations underscores the value of wavelet-based representations, showing that they capture robust and physiologically-grounded features.

These logs are often multi-channel, non-stationary, and anomalies are rare, making anomaly detection challenging.

Our approach first applies a deviation-aware modulation scheme to suppress routine behaviors while amplifying anomalous deviations. Next, discrete wavelet transform (DWT) decomposes the log signals into multi-resolution representations, capturing both long-term trends and short-term anomalies. Finally, a learnable attention mechanism dynamically reweights the most discriminative frequency bands for detection.

This motivates an investigation into the reasons behind such behavior beyond algorithmic design. In this study, we find that one such reason lies in the distribution shift across training domains. A large degree of distribution shift can lead to better performance even under ERM. Specifically, we derive several theoretical and empirical findings demonstrating that distribution shift plays a crucial role in model learning and benefits learning invariant prediction. Firstly, the proposed upper bounds indicate that the degree of distribution shift directly affects the prediction ability of the learned models. If it is large, the models' ability can increase, approximating invariant prediction models that make stable predictions under arbitrary known or unseen domains; and vice versa.

They are hazardous to communities, infrastructure, and ecosystems further downstream. The classical methods of GLOF detection and prediction have so far mainly relied on hydrological modeling, threshold-based lake monitoring, and manual satellite image analysis. These approaches suffer from several drawbacks: slow updates, reliance on manual labor, and losses in accuracy when clouds interfere and/or lack on-site data. To tackle these challenges, we present IceWatch: a novel deep learning framework for GLOF prediction that incorporates both spatial and temporal perspectives. The vision component, RiskFlow, of IceWatch deals with Sentinel-2 multispectral satellite imagery using a CNN-based classifier and predicts GLOF events based on the spatial patterns of snow, ice, and meltwater. Its tabular counterpart confirms this prediction by considering physical dynamics. TerraFlow models glacier velocity from NASA ITS_LIVE time series while TempFlow forecasts near-surface temperature from MODIS LST records; both are trained on long-term observational archives and integrated via harmonized preprocessing and synchronization to enable multimodal, physics-informed GLOF prediction. Both together provide cross-validation, which will improve the reliability and interpretability of GLOF detection.

While traditional methods like Bayesian Optimization (BO) struggle with cold-start issues, Large Language Models (LLMs) can mitigate these via semantic priors. However, existing LLM-based optimizers generalize poorly to the high-dimensional, structured CASH space. We propose LB-MCTS, a framework synergizing LLMs and BO within a Monte Carlo Tree Search structure. It maximizes LLM reasoning with Selective Tuning Memory (STM) and explicit exploration-exploitation trade-off. It combines the strengths of both paradigms by dynamically shifting from LLM-driven to BO-driven proposals as data accumulates.

Many plants still operate with conventional valves that lack real time monitoring, making early predictions challenging. This study presents a machine learning (ML) framework for detecting and predicting stiction using only routinely collected process signals: the controller output (OP) from control systems and the process variable (PV), such as flow rate. Three deep learning models were developed and compared: a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), a hybrid CNN with a Support Vector Machine (CNN-SVM), and a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network. To train these models, a data-driven labeling method based on slope ratio analysis was applied to a real oil and gas refinery dataset. The LSTM model achieved the highest accuracy and was able to predict stiction up to four hours in advance. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first study to demonstrate ML based early prediction of control valve stiction from real industry data.

CPFA learns head-wise prior-strength coefficients $\\{\u03bb_h\\}$ that softly regularize attention toward the prior while allowing data-driven deviations when nonlinear patterns appear to be present in the data. Beyond imputation, SNI aggregates attention maps into a directed feature-dependency matrix that summarizes which variables the imputer relied on, without requiring post-hoc explainers. We evaluate SNI against six baselines (Mean/Mode, MICE, KNN, MissForest, GAIN, MIWAE) on six datasets spanning ICU monitoring, population surveys, socio-economic statistics, and engineering applications. Under MCAR/strict-MAR at 30\\% missingness, SNI is generally competitive on continuous metrics but is often outperformed by accuracy-first baselines (MissForest, MIWAE) on categorical variables; in return, it provides intrinsic dependency diagnostics and explicit statistical-neural trade-off parameters.

Model performance was assessed using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis and calibration curves. Explainability was achieved using SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) to provide global and individual-level interpretation of predictions.\n  Results: The model achieved modest discrimination (AUC = 0.61) with conservative calibration, underestimating risk at higher probability levels.

In this work, we show that many of these approaches implicitly conflate two fundamental and independent design choices: (i) the sampling geometry, which determines which samples dominate the gradient signal, and (ii) the optimization geometry, which determines how deviations in value are penalized. We formalize this observation by expressing alignment as the minimization of a generalized distance between policy energy and target energy, parameterized by an alpha-divergence-based sampling weight and a Bregman-divergence-based value metric. We demonstrate that the commonly used KL divergence induces an exponential penalty on unbounded value signals, leading to numerical instability and vanishing gradients in high-confidence regimes. To address this issue, we propose Orthogonalized Policy Optimization (OPO), a framework that explicitly decouples sampling geometry from optimization geometry. By combining alpha-weighted importance sampling with a chi-square-induced quadratic regularization in ratio coordinates, OPO yields a simple and well-conditioned objective with linear gradient dynamics. This formulation maintains stable optimization while preserving peak-seeking behavior and avoids gradient saturation even when model confidence is high. Our analysis positions OPO as a unifying perspective on existing alignment methods and provides a principled foundation for robust reasoning-oriented training.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u6b63\u4ea4\u5316\u7b56\u7565\u4f18\u5316\uff08OPO\uff09\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u5bf9\u9f50\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e2d\u7684\u91c7\u6837\u51e0\u4f55\u4e0e\u4f18\u5316\u51e0\u4f55\u89e3\u8026\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86KL\u6563\u5ea6\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u6570\u503c\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u73b0\u6709\u5bf9\u9f50\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7edf\u4e00\u89c6\u89d2\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u9f50\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u5982PPO\u3001DPO\u3001IPO\uff09\u5f80\u5f80\u9690\u542b\u5730\u5c06\u4e24\u4e2a\u72ec\u7acb\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u9009\u62e9\u6df7\u4e3a\u4e00\u8c08\uff1a\u91c7\u6837\u51e0\u4f55\uff08\u51b3\u5b9a\u54ea\u4e9b\u6837\u672c\u4e3b\u5bfc\u68af\u5ea6\u4fe1\u53f7\uff09\u548c\u4f18\u5316\u51e0\u4f55\uff08\u51b3\u5b9a\u5982\u4f55\u60e9\u7f5a\u4ef7\u503c\u504f\u5dee\uff09\u3002KL\u6563\u5ea6\u5bf9\u65e0\u754c\u4ef7\u503c\u4fe1\u53f7\u65bd\u52a0\u6307\u6570\u60e9\u7f5a\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6570\u503c\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u548c\u9ad8\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u4e0b\u7684\u68af\u5ea6\u6d88\u5931\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u6b63\u4ea4\u5316\u7b56\u7565\u4f18\u5316\uff08OPO\uff09\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u03b1\u52a0\u6743\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u91c7\u6837\u548c\u5361\u65b9\u8bf1\u5bfc\u7684\u4e8c\u6b21\u6b63\u5219\u5316\uff08\u5728\u6bd4\u7387\u5750\u6807\u4e2d\uff09\u5c06\u91c7\u6837\u51e0\u4f55\u4e0e\u4f18\u5316\u51e0\u4f55\u663e\u5f0f\u89e3\u8026\u3002\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u4ea7\u751f\u7b80\u5355\u4e14\u6761\u4ef6\u826f\u597d\u7684\u76ee\u6807\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u7ebf\u6027\u68af\u5ea6\u52a8\u6001\u3002", "result": "OPO\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u5cf0\u503c\u5bfb\u6c42\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u7a33\u5b9a\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u6a21\u578b\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u9ad8\u65f6\u4e5f\u80fd\u907f\u514d\u68af\u5ea6\u9971\u548c\u3002\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u73b0\u6709\u5bf9\u9f50\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7edf\u4e00\u89c6\u89d2\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u5bfc\u5411\u8bad\u7ec3\u5960\u5b9a\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u91c7\u6837\u51e0\u4f55\u4e0e\u4f18\u5316\u51e0\u4f55\u6b63\u4ea4\u5316\uff0cOPO\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u5bf9\u9f50\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e2d\u7684\u6570\u503c\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u9f50\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u7a33\u5065\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u7684\u5bf9\u9f50\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

However, their effectiveness depends critically on the quality and structure of input representations derived from raw multivariate time-series data. This work proposes a two-stage forecasting framework that explicitly separates local temporal representation learning from global dependency modelling. In the first stage, a convolutional neural network (CNN) operates on fixed-length temporal patches to extract short-range temporal dynamics and non-linear feature interactions, producing compact patch-level token embeddings. Token-level self-attention is subsequently applied during representation learning to refine these embeddings by enabling interactions across temporal patches. In the second stage, a Transformer encoder processes the resulting token sequence to model inter-patch temporal dependencies and generate per-patch forecasts. Experiments conducted on synthetic multivariate time-series data with controlled static and dynamic factors demonstrate that the proposed patch-based tokenization strategy achieves competitive forecasting performance compared to convolutional and patch-based Transformer baselines. The results highlight the importance of structured temporal representations and show that decoupling local temporal encoding from global attention-based modelling yields more effective and stable time-series forecasting.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u9884\u6d4b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u5c40\u90e8\u65f6\u95f4\u8868\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\u4e0e\u5168\u5c40\u4f9d\u8d56\u5efa\u6a21\u5206\u79bb\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7CNN\u63d0\u53d6\u5c40\u90e8\u52a8\u6001\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u518d\u7528Transformer\u5efa\u6a21\u5168\u5c40\u4f9d\u8d56\uff0c\u5728\u5408\u6210\u591a\u5143\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97\u7ade\u4e89\u6027\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "Transformer\u5728\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u9884\u6d4b\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u6548\u679c\u4e25\u91cd\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u4ece\u539f\u59cb\u591a\u5143\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6\u7684\u8f93\u5165\u8868\u793a\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u7ed3\u6784\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u5904\u7406\u5c40\u90e8\u65f6\u95f4\u52a8\u6001\u4e0e\u5168\u5c40\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "method": "\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u6846\u67b6\uff1a\u7b2c\u4e00\u9636\u6bb5\u4f7f\u7528CNN\u5728\u56fa\u5b9a\u957f\u5ea6\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u7247\u6bb5\u4e0a\u63d0\u53d6\u77ed\u7a0b\u65f6\u95f4\u52a8\u6001\u548c\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u7279\u5f81\u4ea4\u4e92\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u7d27\u51d1\u7684\u7247\u6bb5\u7ea7token\u5d4c\u5165\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7token\u7ea7\u81ea\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u7cbe\u70bc\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5d4c\u5165\uff1b\u7b2c\u4e8c\u9636\u6bb5\u4f7f\u7528Transformer\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u5904\u7406token\u5e8f\u5217\uff0c\u5efa\u6a21\u7247\u6bb5\u95f4\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u4f9d\u8d56\u5e76\u751f\u6210\u6bcf\u4e2a\u7247\u6bb5\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5177\u6709\u53d7\u63a7\u9759\u6001\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u56e0\u7d20\u7684\u5408\u6210\u591a\u5143\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u7247\u6bb5\u7684token\u5316\u7b56\u7565\u76f8\u6bd4\u5377\u79ef\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u7247\u6bb5\u7684Transformer\u57fa\u7ebf\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u7ade\u4e89\u6027\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u65f6\u95f4\u8868\u793a\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u5f97\u5230\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u5c06\u5c40\u90e8\u65f6\u95f4\u7f16\u7801\u4e0e\u57fa\u4e8e\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u7684\u5168\u5c40\u5efa\u6a21\u89e3\u8026\u80fd\u591f\u4ea7\u751f\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u9884\u6d4b\u3002"}}

When the total fidelity can be represented as a ratio of two quadratic forms (e.g., in the case of mapping a mixed state to a pure state, projective operators, unitary learning, and others), Semidefinite Programming (SDP) can be applied to solve the fidelity optimization problem with respect to the Choi matrix. A remarkable feature of SDP is that the optimization is convex, which allows the problem to be efficiently solved by a variety of numerical algorithms. We have tested several commercially available SDP solvers, all of which allowed for the reconstruction of quantum channels of different forms. A notable feature is that the Kraus rank of the obtained quantum channel typically comprises less than a few percent of its maximal possible value. This suggests that a relatively small Kraus rank quantum channel is typically sufficient to describe experimentally observed classical data. The theory was also applied to the problem of reconstructing projective operators from data.

When communication is limited, agents must rely on outdated information to estimate gradients and update their policies. A common approach to handle missing data is called importance sampling, in which we reweigh old data from a base policy to estimate gradients for the current policy. However, it quickly becomes unstable when the communication is limited (i.e. missing data probability is high), so that the base policy in importance sampling is outdated. To address this issue, we propose a technique called base policy prediction, which utilizes old gradients to predict the policy update and collect samples for a sequence of base policies, which reduces the gap between the base policy and the current policy. This approach enables effective learning with significantly fewer communication rounds, since the samples of predicted base policies could be collected within one communication round. Theoretically, we show that our algorithm converges to an $\\varepsilon$-Nash equilibrium in potential games with only $O(\\varepsilon^{-3/4})$ communication rounds and $O(poly(\\max_i |A_i|)\\varepsilon^{-11/4})$ samples, improving existing state-of-the-art results in communication cost, as well as sample complexity without the exponential dependence on the joint action space size. We also extend these results to general Markov Cooperative Games to find an agent-wise local maximum.

We propose several improvements that address these fundamental challenges, namely, a Hessian regularization scheme that penalizes unphysical signatures in the Lagrangian's second derivatives with respect to velocities, preventing the network from learning unstable dynamics, activation functions that are better suited to the problem of learning Lagrangians, and a physics-aware coordinate scaling that improves stability. We systematically evaluate these techniques alongside previously proposed methods for improving stability. Our improved architecture successfully trains on systems of unprecedented complexity, including triple pendulums, and achieved 96.6\\% lower validation loss value and 90.68\\% better stability than baseline LNNs in double pendulum systems. With the improved framework, we show that our LNNs can learn Lagrangians representing geodesic motion in both non-relativistic and general relativistic settings. To deal with the relativistic setting, we extended our regularization to penalize violations of Lorentzian signatures, which allowed us to predict a geodesic Lagrangian under AdS\\textsubscript{4} spacetime metric directly from trajectory data, which to our knowledge has not been done in the literature before. This opens new possibilities for automated discovery of geometric structures in physics, including extraction of spacetime metric tensor components from geodesic trajectories.

While the most common decision tree learning algorithms treat data as a batch, numerous algorithms have been proposed to construct decision trees from a data stream. A standard training strategy involves augmenting the current tree by changing a leaf node into a split. Here we typically maintain counters in each leaf which allow us to determine the optimal split, and whether the split should be done. In this paper we focus on how to speed up the search for the optimal split when dealing with sparse binary features and a binary class. We focus on finding splits that have the approximately optimal information gain or Gini index. In both cases finding the optimal split can be done in $O(d)$ time, where $d$ is the number of features. We propose an algorithm that yields $(1 + \u03b1)$ approximation when using conditional entropy in amortized $O(\u03b1^{-1}(1 + m\\log d) \\log \\log n)$ time, where $m$ is the number of 1s in a data point, and $n$ is the number of data points. Similarly, for Gini index, we achieve $(1 + \u03b1)$ approximation in amortized $O(\u03b1^{-1} + m \\log d)$ time. Our approach is beneficial for sparse data where $m \\ll d$. In our experiments we find almost-optimal splits efficiently, faster than the baseline, overperforming the theoretical approximation guarantees.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u9488\u5bf9\u7a00\u758f\u4e8c\u503c\u7279\u5f81\u548c\u4e8c\u503c\u5206\u7c7b\u7684\u51b3\u7b56\u6811\u5206\u88c2\u4f18\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u8fd1\u4f3c\u6700\u4f18\u4fe1\u606f\u589e\u76ca\u6216\u57fa\u5c3c\u6307\u6570\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u7a00\u758f\u6570\u636e\u573a\u666f\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u51b3\u7b56\u6811\u5b66\u4e60\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u5904\u7406\u6570\u636e\u6d41\u65f6\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5728\u6bcf\u4e2a\u53f6\u5b50\u8282\u70b9\u7ef4\u62a4\u8ba1\u6570\u5668\u4ee5\u786e\u5b9a\u6700\u4f18\u5206\u88c2\u70b9\uff0c\u5f53\u9762\u5bf9\u7a00\u758f\u4e8c\u503c\u7279\u5f81\u548c\u4e8c\u503c\u5206\u7c7b\u95ee\u9898\u65f6\uff0c\u5bfb\u627e\u6700\u4f18\u5206\u88c2\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u4e3aO(d)\uff0c\u5176\u4e2dd\u662f\u7279\u5f81\u6570\u91cf\u3002\u5bf9\u4e8e\u7a00\u758f\u6570\u636e\uff08m << d\uff09\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\u6765\u52a0\u901f\u5206\u88c2\u641c\u7d22\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u8fd1\u4f3c\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u9488\u5bf9\u6761\u4ef6\u71b5\u548c\u57fa\u5c3c\u6307\u6570\u4e24\u79cd\u60c5\u51b5\uff1a1) \u5bf9\u4e8e\u6761\u4ef6\u71b5\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0(1+\u03b1)\u8fd1\u4f3c\uff0c\u644a\u9500\u65f6\u95f4\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u4e3aO(\u03b1\u207b\u00b9(1+m log d) log log n)\uff1b2) \u5bf9\u4e8e\u57fa\u5c3c\u6307\u6570\uff0c\u540c\u6837\u5b9e\u73b0(1+\u03b1)\u8fd1\u4f3c\uff0c\u644a\u9500\u65f6\u95f4\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u4e3aO(\u03b1\u207b\u00b9 + m log d)\u3002\u5176\u4e2dm\u662f\u6570\u636e\u70b9\u4e2d1\u7684\u6570\u91cf\uff0cn\u662f\u6570\u636e\u70b9\u6570\u91cf\u3002", "result": "\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u7a00\u758f\u6570\u636e\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u5206\u88c2\u641c\u7d22\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\u80fd\u591f\u9ad8\u6548\u627e\u5230\u8fd1\u4f3c\u6700\u4f18\u5206\u88c2\u70b9\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e14\u5b9e\u9645\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u7406\u8bba\u8fd1\u4f3c\u4fdd\u8bc1\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7b97\u6cd5\u4e3a\u7a00\u758f\u4e8c\u503c\u7279\u5f81\u548c\u4e8c\u503c\u5206\u7c7b\u7684\u51b3\u7b56\u6811\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u5206\u88c2\u641c\u7d22\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u6570\u636e\u6d41\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u4fdd\u8bc1\u8fd1\u4f3c\u6700\u4f18\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u5927\u5e45\u964d\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u3002"}}

In this problem, a central authority must decide, in real time, when to charge dynamically arriving electric vehicles (EVs), subject to capacity limits, with the objective of balancing load across a finite planning horizon. To solve the problem, we first gamify it; that is, we model it as a game where charging blocks are placed within temporal and capacity constraints on a grid. We design heuristic policies, train learning agents with expert demonstrations, and improve them using Dataset Aggregation (DAgger). From a theoretical standpoint, we show that gamification reduces model complexity and yields tighter generalization bounds than vector-based formulations. Experiments across multiple EV arrival patterns confirm that gamified learning enhances load balancing. In particular, the image-to-movement model trained with DAgger consistently outperforms heuristic baselines, vector-based approaches, and supervised learning agents, while also demonstrating robustness in sensitivity analyses.

Submitted and accepted in AAAI-26 (IAAI Emerging Applications track)", "summary": "Future direct-imaging flagship missions, such as NASA's Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO), face critical decisions in prioritizing observations due to extremely stringent time and resource constraints. In this paper, we introduce two advanced machine-learning architectures tailored for predicting biosignature species fluxes from exoplanetary reflected-light spectra: a Bayesian Convolutional Neural Network (BCNN) and our novel model architecture, the Spectral Query Adaptive Transformer (SQuAT). The BCNN robustly quantifies both epistemic and aleatoric uncertainties, offering reliable predictions under diverse observational conditions, whereas SQuAT employs query-driven attention mechanisms to enhance interpretability by explicitly associating spectral features with specific biosignature species. We demonstrate that both models achieve comparably high predictive accuracy on an augmented dataset spanning a wide range of exoplanetary conditions, while highlighting their distinct advantages in uncertainty quantification and spectral interpretability.

Iterative refinements of these models have introduced an increasing number of architectural mechanisms, leading to increased complexity and computational costs. Nevertheless, systematic direct comparisons among these models remain limited. Existing benchmark tasks are either too simplistic to reveal substantial differences or excessively resource-intensive for experimentation. In this work, we propose a refined taxonomy of linear recurrent models and introduce SelectivBench, a set of lightweight and customizable synthetic benchmark tasks for systematically evaluating sequence models. SelectivBench specifically evaluates selectivity in sequence models at small to medium scale, such as the capacity to focus on relevant inputs while ignoring context-based distractors. It employs rule-based grammars to generate sequences with adjustable complexity, incorporating irregular gaps that intentionally violate transition rules. Evaluations of linear recurrent models on SelectivBench reveal performance patterns consistent with results from large-scale language tasks. Our analysis clarifies the roles of essential architectural features: gating and rapid forgetting mechanisms facilitate recall, in-state channel mixing is unnecessary for selectivity, but critical for generalization, and softmax attention remains dominant due to its memory capacity scaling with sequence length. Our benchmark enables targeted, efficient exploration of linear recurrent models and provides a controlled setting for studying behaviors observed in large-scale evaluations.

In particular, the widely used softmax parameterization can induce ill-conditioned optimization landscapes and lead to exponentially slow convergence.

Instead, we propose replacing the softmax with an alternative family of policy parameterizations based on the generalized f-softargmax. We further advocate coupling this parameterization with a regularizer induced by the same f-divergence, which improves the optimization landscape and ensures that the resulting regularized objective satisfies a Polyak-Lojasiewicz inequality. Leveraging this structure, we establish the first explicit non-asymptotic last-iterate convergence guarantees for stochastic policy gradient methods for finite MDPs without any form of preconditioning.

Standard methods combine matrix-vector products with polynomial approximations. We study a different model: access to trace powers $p_k = \\tr(A^k)$, natural when matrix powers are available.\n  Classical moment-based approximations Taylor-expand $\\log(\u03bb)$ around the arithmetic mean. This requires $|\u03bb- \\AM| < \\AM$ and diverges when $\u03ba> 4$. We work instead with the moment-generating function $M(t) = \\E[X^t]$ for normalized eigenvalues $X = \u03bb/\\AM$. Since $M'(0) = \\E[\\log X]$, the log-determinant becomes $\\log\\det(A) = n(\\log \\AM + M'(0))$ -- the problem reduces to estimating a derivative at $t = 0$. Trace powers give $M(k)$ at positive integers, but interpolating $M(t)$ directly is ill-conditioned due to exponential growth. The transform $K(t) = \\log M(t)$ compresses this range. Normalization by $\\AM$ ensures $K(0) = K(1) = 0$. With these anchors fixed, we interpolate $K$ through $m+1$ consecutive integers and differentiate to estimate $K'(0)$. However, this local interpolation cannot capture arbitrary spectral features.\n  We prove a fundamental limit: no continuous estimator using finitely many positive moments can be uniformly accurate over unbounded conditioning. Positive moments downweight the spectral tail; $K'(0) = \\E[\\log X]$ is tail-sensitive. This motivates guaranteed bounds. From the same traces we derive upper bounds on $(\\det A)^{1/n}$.

Evolutionary algorithms offer a promising approach to generating such perturbations due to their ability to navigate non-convex, gradient-free landscapes. In this work, we introduce a float-coded, penalty-driven single-objective evolutionary framework for UAP generation that achieves lower visibility perturbations while enhancing attack success rates. Our approach leverages continuous gene representations aligned with contemporary deep learning scales, incorporates dynamic evolutionary operators with adaptive scheduling, and utilizes a modular PyTorch implementation for seamless integration with modern architectures. Additionally, we ensure the universality of the generated perturbations by testing across diverse models and by periodically switching batches to prevent overfitting. Experimental results on the ImageNet dataset demonstrate that our framework consistently produces perturbations with smaller norms, higher misclassification effectiveness, and faster convergence compared to existing evolutionary-based methods.

Yet most 3D molecular graph neural networks still rely on globally fixed neighborhood heuristics, typically defined by distance cutoffs and maximum neighbor limits, to define local message-passing neighborhoods, leading to rigid, data-agnostic interaction budgets. We propose Multiscale Interaction Mixture of Experts (MI-MoE) to adapt interaction modeling across geometric regimes. Our contributions are threefold: (1) we introduce a distance-cutoff expert ensemble that explicitly captures short-, mid-, and long-range interactions without committing to a single cutoff; (2) we design a topological gating encoder that routes inputs to experts using filtration-based descriptors, including persistent homology features, summarizing how connectivity evolves across radii; and (3) we show that MI-MoE is a plug-in module that consistently improves multiple strong 3D molecular backbones across diverse molecular and polymer property prediction benchmark datasets, covering both regression and classification tasks.

SHAP, in particular, is often treated as a reliable account of which features drove an individual prediction. Yet SHAP explanations can vary substantially across repeated runs even when the input, task, and trained model are held fixed. We term this phenomenon explanation multiplicity: multiple internally valid but substantively different explanations for the same decision. We present a methodology to characterize multiplicity in feature-attribution explanations and to disentangle sources due to model training/selection from stochasticity intrinsic to the explanation pipeline.

To contextualize observed disagreement, we derive randomized baseline values under plausible null models.

DBS involves stimulating specific regions of the brain's Basal Ganglia (BG) using electric impulses to alleviate symptoms of PD such as tremors, rigidity, and bradykinesia. Although most clinical DBS approaches today use a fixed frequency and amplitude, they suffer from side effects (such as slurring of speech) and shortened battery life of the implant. Reinforcement learning (RL) approaches have been used in recent research to perform DBS in a more adaptive manner to improve overall patient outcome. These RL algorithms are, however, too complex to be trained in vivo due to their long convergence time and requirement of high computational resources.\n  We propose a new Time & Threshold-Triggered Multi-Armed Bandit (T3P MAB) RL approach for DBS that is more effective than existing algorithms. Further, our T3P agent is lightweight enough to be deployed in the implant, unlike current deep-RL strategies, and even forgoes the need for an offline training phase. Additionally, most existing RL approaches have focused on modulating only frequency or amplitude, and the possibility of tuning them together remains greatly unexplored in the literature. Our RL agent can tune both frequency and amplitude of DBS signals to the brain with better sample efficiency and requires minimal time to converge.

Theoretically, we show that susceptibilities decompose as a sum over modes of the data distribution, explaining why tokens that follow their contexts \"for similar reasons\" cluster together in susceptibility space.

A wide range of techniques (from classical statistical models to neural network-based approaches such as Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)) have been employed to address time series forecasting challenges. In this paper, we reframe time series forecasting as a two-part task: (1) predicting the trend (directional movement) of the time series at the next time step, and (2) forecasting the quantitative value at the next time step. The trend can be predicted using a binary classifier, while quantitative values can be forecasted using models such as LSTM and Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM). Building on this reframing, we propose the Trend-Adjusted Time Series (TATS) model, which adjusts the forecasted values based on the predicted trend provided by the binary classifier. We validate the proposed approach through both theoretical analysis and empirical evaluation. The TATS model is applied to a volatile financial time series (the daily gold price) with the objective of forecasting the next days price. Experimental results demonstrate that TATS consistently outperforms standard LSTM and Bi-LSTM models by achieving significantly lower forecasting error. In addition, our results indicate that commonly used metrics such as MSE and MAE are insufficient for fully assessing time series model performance. Therefore, we also incorporate trend detection accuracy, which measures how effectively a model captures trends in a time series.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51faTATS\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5c06\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u9884\u6d4b\u91cd\u6784\u4e3a\u8d8b\u52bf\u9884\u6d4b\u548c\u6570\u503c\u9884\u6d4b\u4e24\u90e8\u5206\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8d8b\u52bf\u8c03\u6574\u63d0\u5347\u9884\u6d4b\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u5728\u91d1\u878d\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edfLSTM\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u9884\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u5305\u62ec\u4f20\u7edf\u7edf\u8ba1\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u5982LSTM\uff09\u5728\u9884\u6d4b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0a\u4ecd\u6709\u63d0\u5347\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5bf9\u4e8e\u6ce2\u52a8\u6027\u5f3a\u7684\u91d1\u878d\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u3002\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u5e38\u7528\u7684MSE\u548cMAE\u6307\u6807\u4e0d\u80fd\u5168\u9762\u8bc4\u4f30\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u52a0\u5165\u8d8b\u52bf\u68c0\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u9884\u6d4b\u91cd\u6784\u4e3a\u4e24\u90e8\u5206\u4efb\u52a1\uff1a1) \u4f7f\u7528\u4e8c\u5143\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0b\u4e00\u65f6\u95f4\u6b65\u7684\u8d8b\u52bf\uff08\u65b9\u5411\u6027\u8fd0\u52a8\uff09\uff1b2) \u4f7f\u7528LSTM\u6216Bi-LSTM\u9884\u6d4b\u5b9a\u91cf\u6570\u503c\u3002\u63d0\u51faTATS\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e8c\u5143\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u8d8b\u52bf\u8c03\u6574\u9884\u6d4b\u503c\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6bcf\u65e5\u9ec4\u91d1\u4ef7\u683c\u8fd9\u4e00\u6ce2\u52a8\u6027\u91d1\u878d\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cTATS\u6a21\u578b\u76f8\u6bd4\u6807\u51c6LSTM\u548cBi-LSTM\u6a21\u578b\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u9884\u6d4b\u8bef\u5dee\u3002\u540c\u65f6\u53d1\u73b0\u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528MSE\u548cMAE\u6307\u6807\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u7ed3\u5408\u8d8b\u52bf\u68c0\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u6765\u5168\u9762\u8bc4\u4f30\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "TATS\u6a21\u578b\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u9884\u6d4b\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u8d8b\u52bf\u9884\u6d4b\u548c\u6570\u503c\u9884\u6d4b\u4e24\u90e8\u5206\uff0c\u5e76\u57fa\u4e8e\u9884\u6d4b\u8d8b\u52bf\u8c03\u6574\u6570\u503c\uff0c\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u9884\u6d4b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002\u8d8b\u52bf\u68c0\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u5e94\u4f5c\u4e3a\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u6a21\u578b\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u8865\u5145\u6307\u6807\u3002"}}

Submitted to Operations Research", "summary": "Estimating the unknown reward functions driving agents' behaviors is of central interest in inverse reinforcement learning and game theory. To tackle this problem, we develop a unified framework for reward function recovery in two-player zero-sum matrix games and Markov games with entropy regularization, where we aim to reconstruct the underlying reward functions given observed players' strategies and actions. This task is challenging due to the inherent ambiguity of inverse problems, the non-uniqueness of feasible rewards, and limited observational data coverage. To address these challenges, we establish the reward function's identifiability using the quantal response equilibrium (QRE) under linear assumptions. Building upon this theoretical foundation, we propose a novel algorithm to learn reward functions from observed actions.

With Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), training tends to be exploitation driven: entropy decreases monotonically, samples convergence, and exploration fades. Most existing fixes are \\textbf{sample-centric}: they seek or bonus rare samples, assuming exploration comes from novel trajectories and tokens. These heuristics depend on the \"luck\" of informative samples, lack principled control of the policy, and often yield limited or inconsistent gains. In this work, we are the first to introduce a \\textbf{distribution-centric} perspective for RL, in which exploration is always guided by a \"better\" target distribution, and reveal that a policy's ability to resist entropy collapse is governed by the distribution itself rather than individual samples. Building on this insight, we propose Distribution-Centric Policy Optimization (DCPO), which reformulates entropy regulation as distribution-level regularization. DCPO achieves controllable entropy fully on-policy without sampling from external distributions, enabling efficient exploration while maintaining training stability. Across multiple models and seven benchmarks, DCPO improves over GRPO by about 20\\% on average. Overall, DCPO replaces sample-level heuristics with distribution-level principles, offering a theoretically grounded and flexible framework for controllable exploration and a stronger EE trade-off.

Existing anomaly detection methods in multi-temporal modal data scenarios have the problems of insufficient extraction of spatio-temporal correlation features, high cost of anomaly sample category annotation, and imbalance of anomaly samples. In this paper, a graph neural network anomaly detection backbone network incorporating spatio-temporal correlation features and a multi-task self-supervised training strategy of \"pre-training - graph prompting - fine-tuning\" are designed for the characteristics of WSN graph structure data. First, the anomaly detection backbone network is designed by improving the Mamba model based on a multi-scale strategy and inter-modal fusion method, and combining it with a variational graph convolution module, which is capable of fully extracting spatio-temporal correlation features in the multi-node, multi-temporal modal scenarios of WSNs. Secondly, we design a three-subtask learning \"pre-training\" method with no-negative comparative learning, prediction, and reconstruction to learn generic features of WSN data samples from unlabeled data, and design a \"graph prompting-fine-tuning\" mechanism to guide the pre-trained self-supervised learning. The model is fine-tuned through the \"graph prompting-fine-tuning\" mechanism to guide the pre-trained self-supervised learning model to complete the parameter fine-tuning, thereby reducing the training cost and enhancing the detection generalization performance.

Our theoretical results identify Fourier degree, circuit class (AC$^0$, NC$^1$), and influence as key barriers to expressivity in fairness-aware GNNs. We design a circuit-traversal-based fairness algorithm capable of handling subpopulations defined by high-complexity Boolean functions, such as parity, which break existing baselines. Experiments on real-world graphs show that our method achieves low fairness gaps across intersectional groups where state-of-the-art methods fail, providing the first principled treatment of GNN expressivity tailored to fairness.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u5e03\u5c14\u51fd\u6570\u7406\u8bba\u7684GNN\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u5b50\u7fa4\u4f53\u5e03\u5c14\u540c\u6784(SBI)\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u8d85\u8d8a\u73b0\u6709\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\u5ea6\u91cf\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u5085\u91cc\u53f6\u5ea6\u3001\u7535\u8def\u7c7b\u548c\u5f71\u54cd\u529b\u4e3a\u516c\u5e73\u6027GNN\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u5173\u952e\u969c\u788d\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u80fd\u5904\u7406\u9ad8\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u5e03\u5c14\u51fd\u6570\u5b9a\u4e49\u5b50\u7fa4\u4f53\u7684\u516c\u5e73\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u56fe\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\u5206\u6790\u6846\u67b6\uff08\u5982WL\u3001\u53cc\u8fde\u901a\u6027\u3001\u540c\u6001\u7b49\uff09\u65e0\u6cd5\u7cbe\u7ec6\u5206\u6790GNN\u6355\u6349\u590d\u6742\u5b50\u7fa4\u4f53\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u5904\u7406\u7531\u9ad8\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u5e03\u5c14\u51fd\u6570\u5b9a\u4e49\u7684\u4ea4\u53c9\u5b50\u7fa4\u4f53\u65f6\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u5e03\u5c14\u51fd\u6570\u7406\u8bba\u6784\u5efaGNN\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u5b50\u7fa4\u4f53\u5e03\u5c14\u540c\u6784(SBI)\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u5173\u952e\u969c\u788d\uff08\u5085\u91cc\u53f6\u5ea6\u3001\u7535\u8def\u7c7b\u3001\u5f71\u54cd\u529b\uff09\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u57fa\u4e8e\u7535\u8def\u904d\u5386\u7684\u516c\u5e73\u7b97\u6cd5\u5904\u7406\u9ad8\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u5e03\u5c14\u51fd\u6570\u5b9a\u4e49\u7684\u5b50\u7fa4\u4f53\u3002", "result": "SBI\u4e25\u683c\u5305\u542b\u73b0\u6709\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\u5ea6\u91cf\uff1b\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u56fe\u4e0a\uff0c\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5931\u8d25\u7684\u4ea4\u53c9\u5b50\u7fa4\u4f53\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4f4e\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u9996\u6b21\u4e3a\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u91cf\u8eab\u5b9a\u5236\u4e86GNN\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u5904\u7406\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u5de5\u4f5c\u4e3aGNN\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u5e03\u5c14\u51fd\u6570\u7406\u8bba\u7684\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u9996\u6b21\u7cfb\u7edf\u5904\u7406\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u7684SBI\u6982\u5ff5\u548c\u7535\u8def\u904d\u5386\u7b97\u6cd5\u4e3a\u5904\u7406\u590d\u6742\u5b50\u7fa4\u4f53\u7ed3\u6784\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u4fdd\u8bc1\u548c\u5b9e\u8df5\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

This study proposes a multi-scale graph neural network-based ocean model for 10-day global forecasting that improves short-term prediction skill and enhances the representation of multi-scale ocean variability. The model employs an encoder-processor-decoder architecture and uses two spherical meshes with different resolutions to better capture the multi-scale nature of ocean dynamics. In addition, the model incorporates surface atmospheric variables along with ocean state variables as node inputs to improve short-term prediction accuracy by representing atmospheric forcing. Evaluation using surface kinetic energy spectra and case studies shows that the model accurately represents a broad range of spatial scales, while root mean square error comparisons demonstrate improved skill in short-term predictions.

While knowledge distillation offers a natural and effective approach for model compression, techniques developed for general machine learning tasks are not directly applicable to time series forecasting due to the unique characteristics. To address this, we present DistilTS, the first distillation framework specifically designed for TSFMs. DistilTS addresses two key challenges: (1) task difficulty discrepancy, specific to forecasting, where uniform weighting makes optimization dominated by easier short-term horizons, while long-term horizons receive weaker supervision; and (2) architecture discrepancy, a general challenge in distillation, for which we design an alignment mechanism in the time series forecasting. To overcome these issues, DistilTS introduces horizon-weighted objectives to balance learning across horizons, and a temporal alignment strategy that reduces architectural mismatch, enabling compact models. Experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that DistilTS achieves forecasting performance comparable to full-sized TSFMs, while reducing parameters by up to 1/150 and accelerating inference by up to 6000x.

While instruction tuning is the prevailing method for adapting pre-trained LLMs to graph learning tasks like node classification, it requires a substantial volume of annotated (INSTRUCTION, OUTPUT) pairs deriving from labeled nodes. This requirement is particularly prohibitive in the social domain, where obtaining expert labels for sensitive or evolving content is costly and slow. Furthermore, standard graph instruction tuning fails to exploit the vast amount of unlabeled nodes, which contain latent correlations due to edge connections that are beneficial for downstream predictions. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel Semi-supervised Instruction Tuning pipeline for Graph Learning, named SIT-Graph. Notably, SIT-Graph is model-agnostic and can be seamlessly integrated into any graph instruction tuning method that utilizes LLMs as the predictor. SIT-Graph operates via an iterative self-training process. Initially, the model is fine-tuned using instruction pairs constructed solely from the labeled nodes.

While Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) effectively capture local structural patterns, they struggle to internalize multi hop, logic driven motifs such as fund dispersal and layering that characterize sophisticated money laundering, limiting their forensic accountability under regulations like the FATF Travel Rule. To address this limitation, we propose Relational Domain Logic Integration (RDLI), a framework that embeds expert derived heuristics as differentiable, logic aware latent signals within representation learning. Unlike static rule based approaches, RDLI enables the detection of complex transactional flows that evade standard message passing. To further account for market volatility, we incorporate a Retrieval Grounded Context (RGC) module that conditions anomaly scoring on regulatory and macroeconomic context, mitigating false positives caused by benign regime shifts. Under extreme label scarcity (0.01%), RDLI outperforms state of the art GNN baselines by 28.9% in F1 score.

Their restricted conformational flexibility provides structural pre-organization that is key to their function in drug discovery and catalysis. However, reliably sampling the conformer ensembles of ring systems remains challenging. Here, we introduce PuckerFlow, a generative machine learning model that performs flow matching on the Cremer-Pople space, a low-dimensional internal coordinate system capturing the relevant degrees of freedom of rings. Our approach enables generation of valid closed rings by design and demonstrates strong performance in generating conformers that are both diverse and precise. We show that PuckerFlow outperforms other conformer generation methods on nearly all quantitative metrics and illustrate the potential of PuckerFlow for ring systems relevant to chemical applications, particularly in catalysis and drug discovery.

In such systems, evaluating long-run performance measures typically relies on costly simulation.\n  This paper proposes a supervised learning framework via a neural network model for approximating stationary performance measures of (s,S) inventory systems with general distributions for the interarrival time between demands and lead times under lost sales. Simulations are first used to generate training labels, after which the neural network is trained. After training, the neural network provides almost instantaneous predictions of various metrics of the system, such as the stationary distribution of inventory levels, the expected cycle time, and the probability of lost sales. We find that using a small number of low-order moments of the distributions as input is sufficient to train the neural networks and to accurately capture the steady-state distribution. Extensive numerical experiments demonstrate high accuracy over a wide range of system parameters. As such, it effectively replaces repeated and costly simulation runs.

Compared with existing static graph clustering, it can find the balance between time requirement and space requirement (Time-Space Balance) through the interaction sequence-based batch-processing pattern. However, there are two major challenges that hinder the development of TGC, i.e., inapplicable clustering techniques and inapplicable datasets. To address these challenges, we propose a comprehensive benchmark, called BenchTGC. Specially, we design a BenchTGC Framework to illustrate the paradigm of temporal graph clustering and improve existing clustering techniques to fit temporal graphs. In addition, we also discuss problems with public temporal graph datasets and develop multiple datasets suitable for TGC task, called BenchTGC Datasets.

It has a high global prevalence and places a significant burden on healthcare systems, especially in resource-limited regions. Automated classification of sickle cells in blood images is crucial, allowing the specialist to reduce the effort required and avoid errors when quantifying the deformed cells and assessing the severity of a crisis. Recent studies have proposed various erythrocyte representation and classification methods. Since classification depends solely on cell shape, a suitable approach models erythrocytes as closed planar curves in shape space. This approach employs elastic distances between shapes, which are invariant under rotations, translations, scaling, and reparameterizations, ensuring consistent distance measurements regardless of the curves' position, starting point, or traversal speed. While previous methods exploiting shape space distances had achieved high accuracy, we refined the model by considering the geometric characteristics of healthy and sickled erythrocytes. Our method proposes (1) to employ a fixed parameterization based on the major axis of each cell to compute distances and (2) to align each cell with two templates using this parameterization before computing distances. Aligning shapes to templates before distance computation, a concept successfully applied in areas such as molecular dynamics, and using a fixed parameterization, instead of minimizing distances across all possible parameterizations, simplifies calculations. This strategy achieves 96.03\\% accuracy rate in both supervised classification and unsupervised clustering. Our method ensures efficient erythrocyte classification, maintaining or improving accuracy over shape space models while significantly reducing computational costs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f62\u72b6\u7a7a\u95f4\u548c\u5f39\u6027\u8ddd\u79bb\u7684\u9570\u72b6\u7ec6\u80de\u81ea\u52a8\u5206\u7c7b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u56fa\u5b9a\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u548c\u6a21\u677f\u5bf9\u9f50\u7b80\u5316\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u8fbe\u523096.03%\u51c6\u786e\u7387", "motivation": "\u9570\u72b6\u7ec6\u80de\u75c5\u5728\u5168\u7403\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u8d44\u6e90\u6709\u9650\u5730\u533a\u9020\u6210\u4e25\u91cd\u533b\u7597\u8d1f\u62c5\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u5206\u7c7b\u6765\u51cf\u5c11\u4e13\u5bb6\u5de5\u4f5c\u91cf\u3001\u907f\u514d\u4eba\u5de5\u9519\u8bef\uff0c\u5e76\u51c6\u786e\u8bc4\u4f30\u75c5\u60c5\u4e25\u91cd\u7a0b\u5ea6", "method": "\u5c06\u7ea2\u7ec6\u80de\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u5f62\u72b6\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u7684\u95ed\u5408\u5e73\u9762\u66f2\u7ebf\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u5f39\u6027\u8ddd\u79bb\uff08\u5bf9\u65cb\u8f6c\u3001\u5e73\u79fb\u3001\u7f29\u653e\u548c\u91cd\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u4e0d\u53d8\uff09\u3002\u6539\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\u5305\u62ec\uff1a(1) \u57fa\u4e8e\u7ec6\u80de\u957f\u8f74\u4f7f\u7528\u56fa\u5b9a\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u8ba1\u7b97\u8ddd\u79bb\uff0c(2) \u5728\u8ba1\u7b97\u8ddd\u79bb\u524d\u4f7f\u7528\u8be5\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u5c06\u6bcf\u4e2a\u7ec6\u80de\u4e0e\u4e24\u4e2a\u6a21\u677f\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u7b80\u5316\u8ba1\u7b97", "result": "\u5728\u76d1\u7763\u5206\u7c7b\u548c\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u805a\u7c7b\u4e2d\u90fd\u8fbe\u523096.03%\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u6216\u63d0\u9ad8\u5f62\u72b6\u7a7a\u95f4\u6a21\u578b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u7ea2\u7ec6\u80de\u5206\u7c7b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u56fa\u5b9a\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u548c\u6a21\u677f\u5bf9\u9f50\u7b56\u7565\u7b80\u5316\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f62\u72b6\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u4e3a\u9570\u72b6\u7ec6\u80de\u75c5\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u8bca\u65ad\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848"}}

Similarly, online time series forecasting (OTSF) is a real-world problem where data evolve in time and success depends on both rapid adaptation and long-term memory. Indeed, time-varying and regime-switching forecasting models have been extensively studied, offering a strong justification for the use of OCL in these settings. Building on recent work that applies OCL to OTSF, this paper aims to strengthen the theoretical and practical connections between time series methods and OCL. First, we reframe neural network optimization as a parameter filtering problem, showing that natural gradient descent is a score-driven method and proving its information-theoretic optimality. Then, we show that using a Student's t likelihood in addition to natural gradient induces a bounded update, which improves robustness to outliers. Finally, we introduce Natural Score-driven Replay (NatSR), which combines our robust optimizer with a replay buffer and a dynamic scale heuristic that improves fast adaptation at regime drifts. Empirical results demonstrate that NatSR achieves stronger forecasting performance than more complex state-of-the-art methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u5c06\u5728\u7ebf\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u5728\u7ebf\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u63d0\u51faNatSR\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u7136\u68af\u5ea6\u4e0b\u964d\u4e0e\u91cd\u653e\u7f13\u51b2\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u957f\u671f\u8bb0\u5fc6\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u5feb\u901f\u9002\u5e94\uff0c\u5728\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u7ebf\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u9884\u6d4b\u9700\u8981\u540c\u65f6\u5177\u5907\u5feb\u901f\u9002\u5e94\u65b0\u6570\u636e\u548c\u4fdd\u6301\u957f\u671f\u8bb0\u5fc6\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e0e\u5728\u7ebf\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u76ee\u6807\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4e00\u81f4\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u7406\u8bba\u8054\u7cfb\u548c\u5b9e\u8df5\u6548\u679c\u4e0a\u4ecd\u6709\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5efa\u7acb\u66f4\u7d27\u5bc6\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u548c\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "1) \u5c06\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u4f18\u5316\u91cd\u6784\u4e3a\u53c2\u6570\u6ee4\u6ce2\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u81ea\u7136\u68af\u5ea6\u4e0b\u964d\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u5f97\u5206\u9a71\u52a8\u65b9\u6cd5\u5e76\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u4fe1\u606f\u7406\u8bba\u6700\u4f18\u6027\uff1b2) \u4f7f\u7528Student's t\u4f3c\u7136\u4e0e\u81ea\u7136\u68af\u5ea6\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u6709\u754c\u66f4\u65b0\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u5bf9\u5f02\u5e38\u503c\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff1b3) \u63d0\u51faNatSR\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u9c81\u68d2\u4f18\u5316\u5668\u3001\u91cd\u653e\u7f13\u51b2\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u5c3a\u5ea6\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u5728\u72b6\u6001\u6f02\u79fb\u65f6\u7684\u5feb\u901f\u9002\u5e94\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "result": "NatSR\u5728\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u4e0a\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e86\u66f4\u590d\u6742\u7684\u73b0\u6709\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u5f3a\u5316\u4e86\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0e\u5728\u7ebf\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u5b9e\u8df5\u8054\u7cfb\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u7684NatSR\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5728\u7ebf\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u9884\u6d4b\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u5feb\u901f\u9002\u5e94\u548c\u957f\u671f\u8bb0\u5fc6\u5e73\u8861\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4ef7\u503c\u3002"}}

While the effectiveness of these models can be theoretically explained using differential equations related to the sampling process, previous work by Song and Ermon (2020) demonstrated that neural networks using multiplicative noise conditioning can still generate satisfactory samples. In this setup, the model is expressed as the product of two functions: one depending on the spatial variable and the other on the noise magnitude.

In practice, however, their performance is often hindered by limited representational capacity and optimization difficulties caused by competing physical constraints and conflicting gradients. In this work, we study PINN training from a unified architecture-optimization perspective. We first propose a layer-wise dynamic attention mechanism to enhance representational flexibility, resulting in the Layer-wise Dynamic Attention PINN (LDA-PINN). We then reformulate PINN training as a multi-task learning problem and introduce a conflict-resolved gradient update strategy to alleviate gradient interference, leading to the Gradient-Conflict-Resolved PINN (GC-PINN). By integrating these two components, we develop the Architecture-Conflict-Resolved PINN (ACR-PINN), which combines attentive representations with conflict-aware optimization while preserving the standard PINN loss formulation. Extensive experiments on benchmark PDEs, including the Burgers, Helmholtz, Klein-Gordon, and lid-driven cavity flow problems, demonstrate that ACR-PINN achieves faster convergence and significantly lower relative $L_2$ and $L_\\infty$ errors than standard PINNs.

Recent progress in large language models (LLMs) has therefore spurred interest in autonomous agents that can read scientific papers and extract task-relevant information. However, most existing approaches rely either on heavily engineered prompting or on a conventional SFT-RL training pipeline, both of which often lead to excessive and low-yield exploration. Drawing inspiration from cognitive science, we propose PaperCompass, a framework that mitigates these issues by separating high-level planning from fine-grained execution. PaperCompass first drafts an explicit plan that outlines the intended sequence of actions, and then performs detailed reasoning to instantiate each step by selecting the parameters for the corresponding function calls. To train such behavior, we introduce Draft-and-Follow Policy Optimization (DFPO), a tailored RL method that jointly optimizes both the draft plan and the final solution. DFPO can be viewed as a lightweight form of hierarchical reinforcement learning, aimed at narrowing the `knowing-doing' gap in LLMs. We provide a theoretical analysis that establishes DFPO's favorable optimization properties, supporting a stable and reliable training process.

We propose a Hyper-Temporal Graph Neural Network (HT-GNN), which jointly models demographic heterogeneity and temporal dynamics through three key components: (i) a hypergraph-supervised module capturing inter-segment relationships; (ii) a transformer-based temporal encoder with adaptive weighting; and (iii) a task-adaptive mixture-of-experts with dynamic prediction towers for multi-horizon LTV forecasting.

A common strategy is to isolate updates by routing inputs to different LoRA experts. However, existing LoRA-based Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) methods often jointly update the router and experts in an indiscriminate way, causing the router's preferences to co-drift with experts' adaptation pathways and gradually deviate from early-stage input-expert specialization. We term this phenomenon Misaligned Co-drift, which blurs expert responsibilities and exacerbates forgetting.To address this, we introduce the pathway activation subspace (PASs), a LoRA-induced subspace that reflects which low-rank pathway directions an input activates in each expert, providing a capability-aligned coordinate system for routing and preservation. Based on PASs, we propose a fixed-capacity PASs-based MoE-LoRA method with two components: PAS-guided Reweighting, which calibrates routing using each expert's pathway activation signals, and PAS-aware Rank Stabilization, which selectively stabilizes rank directions important to previous tasks. Experiments on a CIT benchmark show that our approach consistently outperforms a range of conventional continual learning baselines and MoE-LoRA variants in both accuracy and anti-forgetting without adding parameters.

In this work, we present the first systematic kernel interpretability study of the diagonalized state-space model (S4D) trained on a real-world task (vulnerability detection in source code). Through time and frequency domain analysis of the S4D kernel, we show that the long-range modeling capability of S4D varies significantly under different model architectures, affecting model performance. For instance, we show that the depending on the architecture, S4D kernel can behave as low-pass, band-pass or high-pass filter. The insights from our analysis can guide future work in designing better S4D-based models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u9996\u6b21\u5bf9\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u4efb\u52a1\uff08\u6e90\u4ee3\u7801\u6f0f\u6d1e\u68c0\u6d4b\uff09\u4e0a\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684S4D\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6838\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86S4D\u7684\u957f\u7a0b\u5efa\u6a21\u80fd\u529b\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u67b6\u6784\u4e0b\u5dee\u5f02\u663e\u8457\uff0c\u5176\u6838\u53ef\u8868\u73b0\u4e3a\u4f4e\u901a\u3001\u5e26\u901a\u6216\u9ad8\u901a\u6ee4\u6ce2\u5668\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u72b6\u6001\u7a7a\u95f4\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u957f\u5e8f\u5217\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u5927\u591a\u5173\u6ce8\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u800c\u975e\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u586b\u8865\u8fd9\u4e00\u7a7a\u767d\uff0c\u5bf9S4D\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6838\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u5206\u6790\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u5728\u6e90\u4ee3\u7801\u6f0f\u6d1e\u68c0\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684S4D\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u65f6\u57df\u548c\u9891\u57df\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u5176\u6838\u7279\u6027\u3002\u5206\u6790S4D\u6838\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u578b\u67b6\u6784\u4e0b\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0S4D\u7684\u957f\u7a0b\u5efa\u6a21\u80fd\u529b\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u67b6\u6784\u4e0b\u5dee\u5f02\u663e\u8457\uff0c\u76f4\u63a5\u5f71\u54cd\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u5177\u4f53\u800c\u8a00\uff0cS4D\u6838\u53ef\u8868\u73b0\u4e3a\u4f4e\u901a\u3001\u5e26\u901a\u6216\u9ad8\u901a\u6ee4\u6ce2\u5668\uff0c\u8fd9\u53d6\u51b3\u4e8e\u5177\u4f53\u7684\u67b6\u6784\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u7684\u5206\u6790\u7ed3\u679c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u8bbe\u8ba1\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u57fa\u4e8eS4D\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6307\u5bfc\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u67b6\u6784\u9009\u62e9\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u957f\u7a0b\u5efa\u6a21\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u6ee4\u6ce2\u5668\u7279\u6027\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u5f71\u54cd\u3002"}}

To address these challenges, this paper presents a novel, edge-first IoT framework that integrates Tiny Machine Learning (TinyML) for intelligent, offline-capable precision irrigation. The proposed four-layer architecture leverages low-cost hardware, an ESP32 microcontroller as an edge inference node, and a Raspberry Pi as a local edge server to enable autonomous decision-making without cloud dependency. The system utilizes capacitive soil moisture, temperature, humidity, pH, and ambient light sensors for environmental monitoring. A rigorous comparative analysis of ensemble models identified gradient boosting as superior, achieving an R^2 score of 0.9973 and a Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) of 0.99%, outperforming a random forest model (R^2 = 0.9916, MAPE = 1.81%). This optimized model was converted and deployed as a lightweight TinyML inference engine on the ESP32 and predicts irrigation needs with exceptional accuracy (MAPE < 1%). Local communication is facilitated by an MQTT-based LAN protocol, ensuring reliable operation in areas with limited or no internet connectivity. Experimental validation in a controlled environment demonstrated a significant reduction in water usage compared to traditional methods, while the system's low-power design and offline functionality confirm its viability for sustainable, scalable deployment in resource-constrained rural settings.

Chadwick"], "title": "Recursive Meta-Distillation: An Axiomatic Framework for Iterative Knowledge Refinement", "comment": null, "summary": "Recent work in probability-domain knowledge distillation has established axiomatic frameworks for temperature scaling, multi-teacher aggregation, and bias-variance trade-offs in single-stage settings. However, the mathematical behavior of recursive or multi-generation distillation remains poorly understood, with prior approaches relying primarily on empirical heuristics. In this work, we introduce an axiomatic and operator-theoretic framework for recursive meta-distillation, formalizing iterative knowledge distillation as a sequence of probability-distribution operators with explicit anchoring to base teachers.\n  We define structural axioms for valid meta-teacher construction and prove the existence of non-trivial operator families satisfying these axioms without specifying particular algorithms or loss functions. Under mild realizability and convexity assumptions, we show that anchored recursive distillation induces contraction in KL divergence, yielding geometric convergence to base teacher distributions and a unique, globally attractive fixed point.\n  The contribution is foundational rather than algorithmic: the framework characterizes when recursive distillation is mathematically well-posed and convergent rather than error-accumulating, independent of model architecture, optimization details, or specific operator instantiations. These results provide a theoretical basis for understanding stability, bias-variance behavior, and failure modes in iterative and multi-teacher distillation under capacity constraints.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u9012\u5f52\u5143\u84b8\u998f\u7684\u516c\u7406\u5316\u548c\u7b97\u5b50\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u8fed\u4ee3\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u4e3a\u4e00\u7cfb\u5217\u6982\u7387\u5206\u5e03\u7b97\u5b50\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5728\u6e29\u548c\u5047\u8bbe\u4e0b\u951a\u5b9a\u9012\u5f52\u84b8\u998f\u80fd\u8bf1\u5bfcKL\u6563\u5ea6\u6536\u7f29\uff0c\u6536\u655b\u5230\u57fa\u7840\u6559\u5e08\u5206\u5e03\u3002", "motivation": "\u867d\u7136\u6982\u7387\u57df\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u5728\u6e29\u5ea6\u7f29\u653e\u3001\u591a\u6559\u5e08\u805a\u5408\u548c\u5355\u9636\u6bb5\u8bbe\u7f6e\u7684\u504f\u5dee-\u65b9\u5dee\u6743\u8861\u65b9\u9762\u5df2\u6709\u516c\u7406\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4f46\u9012\u5f52\u6216\u591a\u4ee3\u84b8\u998f\u7684\u6570\u5b66\u884c\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u5148\u524d\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3b\u8981\u4f9d\u8d56\u7ecf\u9a8c\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u9012\u5f52\u5143\u84b8\u998f\u7684\u516c\u7406\u5316\u548c\u7b97\u5b50\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u8fed\u4ee3\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u4e3a\u6982\u7387\u5206\u5e03\u7b97\u5b50\u5e8f\u5217\uff0c\u5b9a\u4e49\u6709\u6548\u5143\u6559\u5e08\u6784\u5efa\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u516c\u7406\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u6ee1\u8db3\u8fd9\u4e9b\u516c\u7406\u7684\u975e\u5e73\u51e1\u7b97\u5b50\u65cf\u5b58\u5728\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6e29\u548c\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u6027\u548c\u51f8\u6027\u5047\u8bbe\u4e0b\uff0c\u951a\u5b9a\u9012\u5f52\u84b8\u998f\u8bf1\u5bfcKL\u6563\u5ea6\u6536\u7f29\uff0c\u4ea7\u751f\u51e0\u4f55\u6536\u655b\u5230\u57fa\u7840\u6559\u5e08\u5206\u5e03\u548c\u552f\u4e00\u7684\u5168\u5c40\u5438\u5f15\u4e0d\u52a8\u70b9\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u662f\u57fa\u7840\u6027\u7684\u800c\u975e\u7b97\u6cd5\u6027\u7684\uff0c\u523b\u753b\u4e86\u9012\u5f52\u84b8\u998f\u4f55\u65f6\u5728\u6570\u5b66\u4e0a\u662f\u9002\u5b9a\u548c\u6536\u655b\u7684\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u8bef\u5dee\u7d2f\u79ef\u7684\uff0c\u72ec\u7acb\u4e8e\u6a21\u578b\u67b6\u6784\u3001\u4f18\u5316\u7ec6\u8282\u6216\u7279\u5b9a\u7b97\u5b50\u5b9e\u4f8b\u5316\uff0c\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u8fed\u4ee3\u548c\u591a\u6559\u5e08\u84b8\u998f\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3001\u504f\u5dee-\u65b9\u5dee\u884c\u4e3a\u548c\u5931\u6548\u6a21\u5f0f\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

While token pruning has been actively explored in standard large language models (LLMs) and vision-language models (LVLMs), its application to AV-LLMs has received little attention, even though multimodal integration substantially increases their token demands. To address this gap, we introduce a pruning strategy that utilizes attention weights to identify tokens emphasized at different stages and estimates their importance. Building on this analysis, FastAV applies a two-stage pruning strategy: (1) global pruning in intermediate layers to remove broadly less influential tokens, and (2) fine pruning in later layers considering the impact on next token generation. Notably, our method does not rely on full attention maps, which makes it fully compatible with efficient attention mechanisms such as FlashAttention.

This is essential for ensuring both operational performance and long-term safety. While high fidelity multiphase simulators are widely used for this purpose, they become prohibitively expensive once many forward runs are required for inversion purposes and quantify uncertainty. To tackle this challenge we propose LAViG-FLOW, a latent autoregressive video generation diffusion framework that explicitly learns the coupled evolution of saturation and pressure fields. Each state variable is compressed by a dedicated 2D autoencoder, and a Video Diffusion Transformer (VDiT) models their coupled distribution across time. We first train the model on a given time horizon to learn their coupled relationship and then fine-tune it autoregressively so it can extrapolate beyond the observed time window.

In this work, we conduct a comprehensive and unified evaluation of reasoning paradigms, spanning direct single-model generation, CoT-augmented single-model reasoning, and representative MAS workflows, characterizing their reasoning performance across a diverse suite of closed-form benchmarks. Beyond overall performance, we probe role-specific capability demands in MAS using targeted role isolation analyses, and analyze cost-accuracy trade-offs to identify which MAS workflows offer a favorable balance between cost and accuracy, and which incur prohibitive overhead for marginal gains. We further introduce MIMeBench, a new open-ended benchmark that targets two foundational yet underexplored semantic capabilities - semantic abstraction and contrastive discrimination - thereby providing an alternative evaluation axis beyond closed-form accuracy and enabling fine-grained assessment of semantic competence that is difficult to capture with existing benchmarks. Our results show that increased structural complexity does not consistently lead to improved reasoning performance, with its benefits being highly dependent on the properties and suitability of the reasoning paradigm itself.

We investigate this by evaluating base and instruction-tuned models on standard math benchmarks, structurally perturbed variants, and domain-shifted tasks. Our analysis highlights two key (often overlooked) limitations of instruction tuning. First, the performance advantage is unstable and depends heavily on evaluation settings. In zero-shot CoT settings on GSM8K, base models consistently outperform instruction-tuned variants, with drops as high as 32.67\\% (Llama3-70B). Instruction-tuned models only match or exceed this performance when provided with few-shot exemplars, suggesting a reliance on specific prompting patterns rather than intrinsic reasoning. Second, tuning gains are brittle under distribution shift. Our results show that base models surpass instruction-tuned variants on the domain-specific MedCalc benchmark.

Well-calibrated confidence enables downstream systems to decide when to trust a model and when to defer to fallback mechanisms. In this work, we conduct a systematic study of calibration in two widely used fine-tuning paradigms: supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR). We show that while RLVR improves task performance, it produces extremely overconfident models, whereas SFT yields substantially better calibration, even under distribution shift, though with smaller performance gains. Through targeted experiments, we diagnose RLVR's failure, showing that decision tokens act as extraction steps of the decision in reasoning traces and do not carry confidence information, which prevents reinforcement learning from surfacing calibrated alternatives. Based on this insight, we propose a calibration-aware reinforcement learning formulation that directly adjusts decision-token probabilities.

As AI agents increasingly collaborate on complex work, they must develop coordination capabilities to function as effective teammates. Yet we hypothesize that current agents lack these capabilities. To test this, we introduce CooperBench, a benchmark of over 600 collaborative coding tasks across 12 libraries in 4 programming languages. Each task assigns two agents different features that can be implemented independently but may conflict without proper coordination. Tasks are grounded in real open-source repositories with expert-written tests. Evaluating state-of-the-art coding agents, we observe the curse of coordination: agents achieve on average 30% lower success rates when working together compared to performing both tasks individually. This contrasts sharply with human teams, where adding teammates typically improves productivity. Our analysis reveals three key issues: (1) communication channels become jammed with vague, ill-timed, and inaccurate messages; (2) even with effective communication, agents deviate from their commitments; and (3) agents often hold incorrect expectations about others' plans and communication. Through large-scale simulation, we also observe rare but interesting emergent coordination behavior including role division, resource division, and negotiation.

However, the computational cost of verifying large-scale models remains a significant barrier to adoption. This paper investigates the impact of pruning on formal local robustness certificates with different ratios. Using the state-of-the-art $\u03b1,\u03b2$-CROWN verifier, we evaluate ResNet4 models across varying pruning ratios on MNIST and, more importantly, on the NASA JPL Mars Frost Identification datasets. Our findings demonstrate a non-linear relationship: light pruning (40%) in MNIST and heavy pruning (70%-90%) in JPL improve verifiability, allowing models to outperform unpruned baselines in proven $L_\\infty$ robustness properties. This suggests that reduced connectivity simplifies the search space for formal solvers and that the optimal pruning ratio varies significantly between datasets. This research highlights the complex nature of model compression, offering critical insights into selecting the optimal pruning ratio for deploying efficient, yet formally verified, DNNs in high-stakes environments where reliability is non-negotiable.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u526a\u679d\u5bf9\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6709\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u5f71\u54cd\uff1a\u8f7b\u91cf\u526a\u679d\uff0840%\uff09\u5728MNIST\u4e0a\u3001\u91cd\u5ea6\u526a\u679d\uff0870%-90%\uff09\u5728NASA JPL\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6027\uff0c\u4f7f\u6a21\u578b\u5728L\u221e\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u8bc1\u660e\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u672a\u526a\u679d\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002", "motivation": "\u6df1\u5ea6\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5bf9\u5b89\u5168\u5173\u952e\u5e94\u7528\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9a8c\u8bc1\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u6602\uff0c\u963b\u788d\u4e86\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u3002\u9700\u8981\u63a2\u7d22\u6a21\u578b\u538b\u7f29\uff08\u5982\u526a\u679d\uff09\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6548\u679c\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u03b1,\u03b2-CROWN\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5668\uff0c\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u526a\u679d\u6bd4\u4f8b\u4e0b\u8bc4\u4f30ResNet4\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5728MNIST\u548cNASA JPL\u706b\u661f\u971c\u51bb\u8bc6\u522b\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u526a\u679d\u5bf9\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u5c40\u90e8\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u8bc1\u4e66\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u526a\u679d\u4e0e\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6027\u4e4b\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u5173\u7cfb\uff1aMNIST\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8f7b\u91cf\u526a\u679d\uff0840%\uff09\u6548\u679c\u6700\u4f73\uff0c\u800cNASA JPL\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u91cd\u5ea6\u526a\u679d\uff0870%-90%\uff09\u53cd\u800c\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6027\uff0c\u4f7f\u6a21\u578b\u5728L\u221e\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u8bc1\u660e\u4e0a\u8d85\u8d8a\u672a\u526a\u679d\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u51cf\u5c11\u7f51\u7edc\u8fde\u63a5\u7b80\u5316\u4e86\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u7684\u641c\u7d22\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u6700\u4f18\u526a\u679d\u6bd4\u4f8b\u56e0\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5dee\u5f02\u663e\u8457\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u5728\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u90e8\u7f72\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u7ecf\u8fc7\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684DNN\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5173\u952e\u89c1\u89e3\u3002"}}

In this work, we propose to interpret smoothed transport plans as adjacency matrices of bipartite graphs connecting source to target domain and derive domain-invariant samples' representations through spectral embedding.

Recently, deterministic state space models have re-emerged in natural language processing through architectures such as S4 and Mamba, raising new questions about the relationship between classical probabilistic SSMs, HMMs, and modern neural sequence models.\n  In this paper, we present a unified and systematic comparison of HMMs, linear Gaussian state space models, Kalman filtering, and contemporary NLP state space models. We analyze their formulations through the lens of probabilistic graphical models, examine their inference algorithms -- including forward-backward inference and Kalman filtering -- and contrast their learning procedures via Expectation-Maximization and gradient-based optimization. By highlighting both structural similarities and semantic differences, we clarify when these models are equivalent, when they fundamentally diverge, and how modern NLP SSMs relate to classical probabilistic models.

We present RoundTripCodeEval (RTCE), a comprehensive benchmark consisting of four distinct code execution reasoning tasks designed to rigorously test round-trip consistency. RTCE provides an execution-free, exact-match evaluation of bijection fidelity, assessing whether models preserve a consistent one-to-one mapping between encoding and decoding operations across various algorithms and directions. We systematically evaluate state-of-the-art Code-LLMs using zero-shot prompting, supervised fine-tuning on execution traces, and self-reflection mechanisms. Each yields modest improvements, but none closes the gap, indicating that current LLMs struggle with true round-trip consistency, which demonstrates that they lack the internal coherence required for trustworthy code reasoning. RTCE surfaces several new and previously unmeasured insights that are not captured by existing I/O-prediction, execution-reasoning, or round-trip natural-language benchmarks.

Although a plethora of deep learning approaches have been proposed to perform this task, most of them either overlook the essential spatial correlations across households or fail to scale to individualized prediction, making them less effective for accurate fine-grained user-level prediction. In addition, due to the dynamic and uncertain nature of energy usage caused by various factors such as extreme weather events, quantifying uncertainty for reliable prediction is also significant, but it has not been fully explored in existing work. In this paper, we propose a unified framework called TrustEnergy for accurate and reliable user-level energy usage prediction. There are two key technical components in TrustEnergy, (i) a Hierarchical Spatiotemporal Representation module to efficiently capture both macro and micro energy usage patterns with a novel memory-augmented spatiotemporal graph neural network, and (ii) an innovative Sequential Conformalized Quantile Regression module to dynamically adjust uncertainty bounds to ensure valid prediction intervals over time, without making strong assumptions about the underlying data distribution. We implement and evaluate our TrustEnergy framework by working with an electricity provider in Florida, and the results show our TrustEnergy can achieve a 5.4% increase in prediction accuracy and 5.7% improvement in uncertainty quantification compared to state-of-the-art baselines.", "AI": {"tldr": "TrustEnergy\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u7528\u4e8e\u51c6\u786e\u53ef\u9760\u7528\u6237\u7ea7\u80fd\u6e90\u4f7f\u7528\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u5206\u5c42\u65f6\u7a7a\u8868\u793a\u6a21\u5757\u548c\u987a\u5e8f\u7b26\u5408\u5206\u4f4d\u6570\u56de\u5f52\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u5728\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u91cf\u5316\u65b9\u9762\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u80fd\u6e90\u4f7f\u7528\u9884\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u5927\u591a\u5ffd\u89c6\u5bb6\u5ead\u95f4\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u76f8\u5173\u6027\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u4e2a\u4f53\u5316\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u4e14\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u52a8\u6001\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u7684\u91cf\u5316\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u6ee1\u8db3\u51c6\u786e\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u7684\u7528\u6237\u7ea7\u9884\u6d4b\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faTrustEnergy\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1) \u5206\u5c42\u65f6\u7a7a\u8868\u793a\u6a21\u5757\u4f7f\u7528\u8bb0\u5fc6\u589e\u5f3a\u65f6\u7a7a\u56fe\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u6355\u83b7\u5b8f\u89c2\u548c\u5fae\u89c2\u80fd\u6e90\u4f7f\u7528\u6a21\u5f0f\uff1b2) \u987a\u5e8f\u7b26\u5408\u5206\u4f4d\u6570\u56de\u5f52\u6a21\u5757\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u8fb9\u754c\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u5bf9\u6570\u636e\u5206\u5e03\u505a\u5f3a\u5047\u8bbe\u3002", "result": "\u4e0e\u4f5b\u7f57\u91cc\u8fbe\u7535\u529b\u4f9b\u5e94\u5546\u5408\u4f5c\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0cTrustEnergy\u76f8\u6bd4\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u63d0\u53475.4%\uff0c\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u91cf\u5316\u6539\u8fdb5.7%\u3002", "conclusion": "TrustEnergy\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u6709\u6548\u6355\u6349\u65f6\u7a7a\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u91cf\u5316\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u51c6\u786e\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u7528\u6237\u7ea7\u80fd\u6e90\u4f7f\u7528\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u4e3a\u7535\u7f51\u7ba1\u7406\u3001\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\u89c4\u5212\u548c\u707e\u5bb3\u54cd\u5e94\u7b49\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

We propose \\emph{WaveLSFormer}, a learnable wavelet-based long-short Transformer that jointly performs multi-scale decomposition and return-oriented decision learning. Specifically, a learnable wavelet front-end generates low-/high-frequency components via an end-to-end trained filter bank, guided by spectral regularizers that encourage stable and well-separated frequency bands. To fuse multi-scale information, we introduce a low-guided high-frequency injection (LGHI) module that refines low-frequency representations with high-frequency cues while controlling training stability. The model outputs a portfolio of long/short positions that is rescaled to satisfy a fixed risk budget, and is optimized directly with a trading objective and risk-aware regularization. Extensive experiments on five years of hourly data across six industry groups, evaluated over ten random seeds, demonstrate that WaveLSFormer consistently outperforms MLP, LSTM and Transformer backbones, with and without fixed discrete wavelet front-ends. On average in all industries, WaveLSFormer achieves a cumulative overall strategy return of $0.607 \\pm 0.045$ and a Sharpe ratio of $2.157 \\pm 0.166$, substantially improving both profitability and risk-adjusted returns over the strongest baselines.", "AI": {"tldr": "WaveLSFormer\uff1a\u4e00\u79cd\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u5c0f\u6ce2\u53d8\u6362\u957f\u77ed\u671fTransformer\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u65e5\u5185\u4ea4\u6613\u7b56\u7565\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u5206\u89e3\u548c\u98ce\u9669\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u884c\u4e1a\u7ec4\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u8d85\u8d8a\u4f20\u7edf\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u91d1\u878d\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u7684\u65e5\u5185\u4ea4\u6613\u7b56\u7565\u5b66\u4e60\u9762\u4e34\u4e09\u5927\u6311\u6218\uff1a\u9ad8\u566a\u58f0\u3001\u975e\u5e73\u7a33\u6027\u548c\u8d44\u4ea7\u95f4\u7684\u5f3a\u6a2a\u622a\u9762\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\u3002\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u5904\u7406\u8fd9\u4e9b\u590d\u6742\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u591f\u8054\u5408\u8fdb\u884c\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u5206\u89e3\u548c\u6536\u76ca\u5bfc\u5411\u51b3\u7b56\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faWaveLSFormer\u6a21\u578b\uff1a1) \u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u5c0f\u6ce2\u524d\u7aef\u901a\u8fc7\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u6ee4\u6ce2\u5668\u7ec4\u751f\u6210\u4f4e/\u9ad8\u9891\u5206\u91cf\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u9891\u8c31\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u5668\u786e\u4fdd\u7a33\u5b9a\u4e14\u5206\u79bb\u826f\u597d\u7684\u9891\u5e26\uff1b2) \u4f4e\u5f15\u5bfc\u9ad8\u9891\u6ce8\u5165(LGHI)\u6a21\u5757\u878d\u5408\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u7528\u9ad8\u9891\u7ebf\u7d22\u7ec6\u5316\u4f4e\u9891\u8868\u793a\u5e76\u63a7\u5236\u8bad\u7ec3\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff1b3) \u8f93\u51fa\u957f/\u77ed\u5934\u5bf8\u7ec4\u5408\uff0c\u6309\u56fa\u5b9a\u98ce\u9669\u9884\u7b97\u91cd\u65b0\u7f29\u653e\uff0c\u76f4\u63a5\u901a\u8fc7\u4ea4\u6613\u76ee\u6807\u548c\u98ce\u9669\u611f\u77e5\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u8fdb\u884c\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u57285\u5e74\u6bcf\u5c0f\u65f6\u6570\u636e\u30016\u4e2a\u884c\u4e1a\u7ec4\u300110\u4e2a\u968f\u673a\u79cd\u5b50\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0cWaveLSFormer\u59cb\u7ec8\u4f18\u4e8eMLP\u3001LSTM\u548cTransformer\u57fa\u7ebf\uff08\u65e0\u8bba\u662f\u5426\u4f7f\u7528\u56fa\u5b9a\u79bb\u6563\u5c0f\u6ce2\u524d\u7aef\uff09\u3002\u5728\u6240\u6709\u884c\u4e1a\u5e73\u5747\u4e2d\uff0cWaveLSFormer\u5b9e\u73b0\u7d2f\u8ba1\u603b\u7b56\u7565\u6536\u76ca0.607\u00b10.045\uff0c\u590f\u666e\u6bd4\u73872.157\u00b10.166\uff0c\u5728\u76c8\u5229\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u98ce\u9669\u8c03\u6574\u6536\u76ca\u65b9\u9762\u663e\u8457\u8d85\u8d8a\u6700\u5f3a\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002", "conclusion": "WaveLSFormer\u901a\u8fc7\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u5c0f\u6ce2\u5206\u89e3\u548cTransformer\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u91d1\u878d\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u4ea4\u6613\u4e2d\u7684\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u7279\u5f81\u63d0\u53d6\u548c\u98ce\u9669\u63a7\u5236\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u65e5\u5185\u4ea4\u6613\u7b56\u7565\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5f3a\u5927\u4e14\u7a33\u5065\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

This paper introduces a domain-specific implicit generative framework for turbine blade geometry using DeepSDF, addressing critical gaps in performance-aware modeling and manufacturable design generation. The proposed method leverages a continuous signed distance function (SDF) representation to reconstruct and generate smooth, watertight geometries with quantified accuracy. It establishes an interpretable, near-Gaussian latent space that aligns with blade-relevant parameters, such as taper and chord ratios, enabling controlled exploration and unconditional synthesis through interpolation and Gaussian sampling. In addition, a compact neural network maps engineering descriptors, such as maximum directional strains, to latent codes, facilitating the generation of performance-informed geometry. The framework achieves high reconstruction fidelity, with surface distance errors concentrated within $1\\%$ of the maximum blade dimension, and demonstrates robust generalization to unseen designs.

This issue arises frequently in traditional in-processing approaches such as fairness-through-regularization. In contrast, existing Pareto-efficient approaches are biased towards a certain perspective on fairness and fail to adapt to the broad range of fairness metrics studied in the literature. In this paper, we present BADR, a simple framework to recover the optimal Pareto-efficient model for any fairness metric. Our framework recovers its models through a Bilevel Adaptive Rescalarisation procedure. The lower level is a weighted empirical risk minimization task where the weights are a convex combination of the groups, while the upper level optimizes the chosen fairness objective. We equip our framework with two novel large-scale, single-loop algorithms, BADR-GD and BADR-SGD, and establish their convergence guarantees. We release badr, an open-source Python toolbox implementing our framework for a variety of learning tasks and fairness metrics.

Proceedings for the 26th International Symposium on Spin Physics (SPIN2025), September 21-26, 2025; Qingdao, Shandong, China", "summary": "As quantum machine-learning architectures mature, a central challenge is no longer their construction, but identifying the regimes in which they offer practical advantages over classical approaches. In this work, we introduce a framework for addressing this question in data-driven hadronic physics problems by developing diagnostic tools - centered on a quantitative quantum qualifier - that guide model selection between classical and quantum deep neural networks based on intrinsic properties of the data. Using controlled classification and regression studies, we show how relative model performance follows systematic trends in complexity, noise, and dimensionality, and how these trends can be distilled into a predictive criterion. We then demonstrate the utility of this approach through an application to Compton form factor extraction from deeply virtual Compton scattering, where the quantum qualifier identifies kinematic regimes favorable to quantum models. Together, these results establish a principled framework for deploying quantum machine-learning tools in precision hadronic physics.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u91cf\u5b50\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u8bca\u65ad\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u91cf\u5b50\u9650\u5b9a\u5668\u6307\u5bfc\u5728\u5f3a\u5b50\u7269\u7406\u95ee\u9898\u4e2d\u9009\u62e9\u7ecf\u5178\u6216\u91cf\u5b50\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u5eb7\u666e\u987f\u5f62\u72b6\u56e0\u5b50\u63d0\u53d6\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u91cf\u5b50\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u67b6\u6784\u7684\u6210\u719f\uff0c\u5173\u952e\u6311\u6218\u4e0d\u518d\u662f\u6784\u5efa\u8fd9\u4e9b\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u800c\u662f\u8bc6\u522b\u5b83\u4eec\u5728\u54ea\u4e9b\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u80fd\u63d0\u4f9b\u76f8\u5bf9\u4e8e\u7ecf\u5178\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u4f18\u52bf\u3002\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u5f3a\u5b50\u7269\u7406\u95ee\u9898\u4e2d\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u6307\u5bfc\u6a21\u578b\u9009\u62e9\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u8bca\u65ad\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6838\u5fc3\u662f\u5b9a\u91cf\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u9650\u5b9a\u5668\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u6570\u636e\u7684\u5185\u5728\u7279\u6027\u6307\u5bfc\u7ecf\u5178\u4e0e\u91cf\u5b50\u6df1\u5ea6\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u9009\u62e9\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u53d7\u63a7\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\u548c\u56de\u5f52\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u968f\u590d\u6742\u6027\u3001\u566a\u58f0\u548c\u7ef4\u5ea6\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u8d8b\u52bf\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u8fd9\u4e9b\u8d8b\u52bf\u63d0\u70bc\u4e3a\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u5219\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\u76f8\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u9075\u5faa\u590d\u6742\u6027\u3001\u566a\u58f0\u548c\u7ef4\u5ea6\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u8d8b\u52bf\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u8d8b\u52bf\u53ef\u4ee5\u63d0\u70bc\u4e3a\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u5219\u3002\u5728\u6df1\u5ea6\u865a\u62df\u5eb7\u666e\u987f\u6563\u5c04\u7684\u5eb7\u666e\u987f\u5f62\u72b6\u56e0\u5b50\u63d0\u53d6\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\uff0c\u91cf\u5b50\u9650\u5b9a\u5668\u6210\u529f\u8bc6\u522b\u51fa\u6709\u5229\u4e8e\u91cf\u5b50\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8fd0\u52a8\u5b66\u533a\u57df\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7ed3\u679c\u4e3a\u5728\u7cbe\u5bc6\u5f3a\u5b50\u7269\u7406\u4e2d\u90e8\u7f72\u91cf\u5b50\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u5de5\u5177\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u539f\u5219\u6027\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4e3a\u91cf\u5b50\u4f18\u52bf\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7cfb\u7edf\u6307\u5bfc\u3002"}}

However, the underlying mechanisms of Muon -- particularly the role of gradient orthogonalization -- remain poorly understood, with very few works providing end-to-end analyses that rigorously explain its advantages in concrete applications. We take a step by studying the effectiveness of a simplified variant of Muon through two case studies: matrix factorization, and in-context learning of linear transformers. For both problems, we prove that simplified Muon converges linearly with iteration complexities independent of the relevant condition number, provably outperforming gradient descent and Adam. Our analysis reveals that the Muon dynamics decouple into a collection of independent scalar sequences in the spectral domain, each exhibiting similar convergence behavior. Our theory formalizes the preconditioning effect induced by spectral orthogonalization, offering insight into Muon's effectiveness in these matrix optimization problems and potentially beyond.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u5206\u6790\u4e86Muon\u4f18\u5316\u5668\u7684\u7b80\u5316\u53d8\u4f53\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5728\u77e9\u9635\u5206\u89e3\u548c\u7ebf\u6027Transformer\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\uff0c\u8be5\u7b97\u6cd5\u5177\u6709\u72ec\u7acb\u4e8e\u6761\u4ef6\u6570\u7684\u7ebf\u6027\u6536\u655b\u6027\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u68af\u5ea6\u4e0b\u964d\u548cAdam\u3002", "motivation": "Muon\u4f18\u5316\u5668\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5229\u7528\u68af\u5ea6\u8c31\u6b63\u4ea4\u5316\u7684\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u91cc\u7a0b\u7891\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5176\u5e95\u5c42\u673a\u5236\u7279\u522b\u662f\u68af\u5ea6\u6b63\u4ea4\u5316\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\u4ecd\u4e0d\u660e\u786e\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u6765\u89e3\u91ca\u5176\u5728\u5177\u4f53\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u4e2a\u6848\u4f8b\u7814\u7a76\u7b80\u5316\u7248Muon\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff1a\u77e9\u9635\u5206\u89e3\u548c\u7ebf\u6027Transformer\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5b66\u4e60\u3002\u5728\u8c31\u57df\u4e2d\u5c06Muon\u52a8\u6001\u89e3\u8026\u4e3a\u72ec\u7acb\u7684\u6807\u91cf\u5e8f\u5217\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u5176\u6536\u655b\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "result": "\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u7b80\u5316Muon\u5728\u8fd9\u4e24\u4e2a\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\u90fd\u5177\u6709\u72ec\u7acb\u4e8e\u76f8\u5173\u6761\u4ef6\u6570\u7684\u7ebf\u6027\u6536\u655b\u6027\uff0c\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u68af\u5ea6\u4e0b\u964d\u548cAdam\u3002\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u8c31\u6b63\u4ea4\u5316\u8bf1\u5bfc\u7684\u9884\u5904\u7406\u6548\u5e94\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7406\u8bba\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u4e86\u8c31\u6b63\u4ea4\u5316\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u9884\u5904\u7406\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u4e3aMuon\u5728\u77e9\u9635\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u4e2d\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u89e3\u91ca\uff0c\u5e76\u53ef\u80fd\u63a8\u5e7f\u5230\u66f4\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u573a\u666f\u3002"}}

However, real-world EV datasets are often plagued by missing records, and existing imputation methods are ill-equipped for the complex, multimodal context of charging data, often relying on a restrictive one-model-per-station paradigm that ignores valuable inter-station correlations. To address these gaps, we develop a novel PRobabilistic variational imputation framework that leverages the power of large lAnguage models and retrIeval-augmented Memory (PRAIM). PRAIM employs a pre-trained language model to encode heterogeneous data, spanning time-series demand, calendar features, and geospatial context, into a unified, semantically rich representation. This is dynamically fortified by retrieval-augmented memory that retrieves relevant examples from the entire charging network, enabling a single, unified imputation model empowered by variational neural architecture to overcome data sparsity.

Among various tensor models, low-Tucker-rank tensors are particularly attractive for capturing multi-mode subspace structures in high-dimensional data. Existing recovery methods either operate on the full tensor variable with expensive tensor projections, or adopt factorized formulations that still rely on full-gradient computations, while most stochastic factorized approaches are restricted to tensor decomposition settings. In this work, we propose a stochastic alternating minimization algorithm that operates directly on the core tensor and factor matrices under a Tucker factorization. The proposed method avoids repeated tensor projections and enables efficient mini-batch updates on low-dimensional tensor factors. Numerical experiments on synthetic tensor sensing demonstrate that the proposed algorithm exhibits favorable convergence behavior in wall-clock time compared with representative stochastic tensor recovery baselines.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8eTucker\u5206\u89e3\u7684\u968f\u673a\u4ea4\u66ff\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u76f4\u63a5\u5728\u6838\u5fc3\u5f20\u91cf\u548c\u56e0\u5b50\u77e9\u9635\u4e0a\u64cd\u4f5c\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u91cd\u590d\u5f20\u91cf\u6295\u5f71\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4f4e\u7ef4\u5f20\u91cf\u56e0\u5b50\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u5c0f\u6279\u91cf\u66f4\u65b0\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f4eTucker\u79e9\u5f20\u91cf\u611f\u77e5\u662f\u4fe1\u53f7\u5904\u7406\u548c\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u57fa\u672c\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u8981\u4e48\u5728\u5168\u5f20\u91cf\u53d8\u91cf\u4e0a\u64cd\u4f5c\u4e14\u9700\u8981\u6602\u8d35\u7684\u5f20\u91cf\u6295\u5f71\uff0c\u8981\u4e48\u91c7\u7528\u56e0\u5b50\u5316\u516c\u5f0f\u4f46\u4ecd\u4f9d\u8d56\u5168\u68af\u5ea6\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u800c\u5927\u591a\u6570\u968f\u673a\u56e0\u5b50\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ec5\u9650\u4e8e\u5f20\u91cf\u5206\u89e3\u8bbe\u7f6e\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u968f\u673a\u4ea4\u66ff\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u76f4\u63a5\u5728Tucker\u5206\u89e3\u4e0b\u7684\u6838\u5fc3\u5f20\u91cf\u548c\u56e0\u5b50\u77e9\u9635\u4e0a\u64cd\u4f5c\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u91cd\u590d\u5f20\u91cf\u6295\u5f71\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9\u4f4e\u7ef4\u5f20\u91cf\u56e0\u5b50\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u5c0f\u6279\u91cf\u66f4\u65b0\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5408\u6210\u5f20\u91cf\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u6570\u503c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0c\u4e0e\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u968f\u673a\u5f20\u91cf\u6062\u590d\u57fa\u7ebf\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u4f18\u7684\u6536\u655b\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u4f4eTucker\u79e9\u5f20\u91cf\u611f\u77e5\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u968f\u673a\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u5728\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\u4e0a\u5177\u6709\u4f18\u52bf\u3002"}}

However, most existing methods assume regularly sampled observations and fixed output resolutions, which are often misaligned with real-world scenarios where data are irregularly sampled and sparsely observed. This mismatch is particularly problematic in applications such as clinical monitoring, where irregular measurements must support downstream tasks requiring continuous and high-resolution time series.\n  Neural Controlled Differential Equations (NCDEs) have shown strong potential for modeling irregular time series, yet they still face challenges in capturing complex dynamic temporal patterns and supporting continuous TSG. To address these limitations, we propose MN-TSG, a novel framework that explores Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)-based NCDEs and integrates them with existing TSG models for irregular and continuous generation tasks.\n  The core of MN-TSG lies in a MoE-NCDE architecture with dynamically parameterized expert functions and a decoupled design that facilitates more effective optimization of MoE dynamics. Furthermore, we leverage existing TSG models to learn the joint distribution over the mixture of experts and the generated time series. This enables the framework not only to generate new samples, but also to produce appropriate expert configurations tailored to each sample, thereby supporting refined continuous TSG.\n  Extensive experiments on ten public and synthetic datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of MN-TSG, consistently outperforming strong TSG baselines on both irregular-to-regular and irregular-to-continuous generation tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "MN-TSG\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e13\u5bb6\u6df7\u5408\u795e\u7ecf\u63a7\u5236\u5fae\u5206\u65b9\u7a0b\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u751f\u6210\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4e13\u95e8\u5904\u7406\u4e0d\u89c4\u5219\u91c7\u6837\u548c\u7a00\u758f\u89c2\u6d4b\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u8fde\u7eed\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u751f\u6210\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u5927\u591a\u5047\u8bbe\u89c4\u5219\u91c7\u6837\u548c\u56fa\u5b9a\u8f93\u51fa\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\uff0c\u4e0e\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u4e2d\u4e0d\u89c4\u5219\u91c7\u6837\u3001\u7a00\u758f\u89c2\u6d4b\u7684\u573a\u666f\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u4e34\u5e8a\u76d1\u6d4b\u7b49\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u9700\u8981\u652f\u6301\u8fde\u7eed\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u751f\u6210\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faMN-TSG\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u4e13\u5bb6\u6df7\u5408\u795e\u7ecf\u63a7\u5236\u5fae\u5206\u65b9\u7a0b\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u52a8\u6001\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u7684\u4e13\u5bb6\u51fd\u6570\u548c\u89e3\u8026\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u73b0\u6709TSG\u6a21\u578b\u5b66\u4e60\u4e13\u5bb6\u6df7\u5408\u4e0e\u751f\u6210\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u7684\u8054\u5408\u5206\u5e03\u3002", "result": "\u572810\u4e2a\u516c\u5171\u548c\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cMN-TSG\u5728\u4ece\u4e0d\u89c4\u5219\u5230\u89c4\u5219\u548c\u4e0d\u89c4\u5219\u5230\u8fde\u7eed\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u5f3a\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "MN-TSG\u901a\u8fc7\u4e13\u5bb6\u6df7\u5408NCDE\u67b6\u6784\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4e0d\u89c4\u5219\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u7684\u8fde\u7eed\u751f\u6210\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u4e3a\u6bcf\u4e2a\u6837\u672c\u751f\u6210\u9002\u5f53\u7684\u4e13\u5bb6\u914d\u7f6e\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u7cbe\u7ec6\u7684\u8fde\u7eed\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u751f\u6210\u3002"}}

We introduce patterning as the dual problem: given a desired form of generalization, determine what training data produces it. Our approach is based on susceptibilities, which measure how posterior expectation values of observables respond to infinitesimal shifts in the data distribution. Inverting this linear response relationship yields the data intervention that steers the model toward a target internal configuration. We demonstrate patterning in a small language model, showing that re-weighting training data along principal susceptibility directions can accelerate or delay the formation of structure, such as the induction circuit. In a synthetic parentheses balancing task where multiple algorithms achieve perfect training accuracy, we show that patterning can select which algorithm the model learns by targeting the local learning coefficient of each solution.

Current compression methods like quantization, pruning and low-rank factorization reduce constant factors but leave the scaling bottleneck unresolved. We introduce ButterflyMoE, a method that treats experts not as independent weight matrices but as geometric reorientations of a unified shared quantized substrate. Diversity among experts arises from viewing different angles of shared capacity, not from redundant storage. By applying learned rotations to a shared ternary prototype, each expert yields $\\mathcal{O}(d^2 + N \\cdot d \\log d)$ memory -- sub-linear in the number of experts. The key insight: training these rotations with quantization reduces activation outliers and stabilizes extreme low bit training, where static methods collapse. Across language modeling benchmarks, ButterflyMoE achieves 150 times memory reduction at 256 experts with negligible accuracy loss.

Conventional generate-score-screen approaches become impractical under such realistic design specifications, owing to their low search efficiency, unreliable generalizability of machine-learning prediction, and the prohibitive cost of quantum chemical calculation. Here we present LUMOS, a data-and-physics driven framework for inverse design of fluorescent molecules. LUMOS couples generator and predictor within a shared latent representation, enabling direct specification-to-molecule design and efficient exploration. Moreover, LUMOS combines neural networks with a fast time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT) calculation workflow to build a suite of complementary predictors spanning different trade-offs in speed, accuracy, and generalizability, enabling reliable property prediction across diverse scenarios. Finally, LUMOS employs a property-guided diffusion model integrated with multi-objective evolutionary algorithms, enabling de novo design and molecular optimization under multiple objectives and constraints. Across comprehensive benchmarks, LUMOS consistently outperforms baseline models in terms of accuracy, generalizability and physical plausibility for fluorescence property prediction, and demonstrates superior performance in multi-objective scaffold- and fragment-level molecular optimization. Further validation using TD-DFT and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations demonstrates that LUMOS can generate valid fluorophores that meet various target specifications.

Existing watermarking methods primarily operate on graph structures or entangled graph representations, which compromise the transparency and robustness of watermarks due to the information coupling in representing graphs and uncontrollable discretization in transforming continuous numerical representations into graph structures. This motivates us to propose DRGW, the first graph watermarking framework that addresses these issues through disentangled representation learning. Specifically, we design an adversarially trained encoder that learns an invariant structural representation against diverse perturbations and derives a statistically independent watermark carrier, ensuring both robustness and transparency of watermarks.

By combining the flexibility of deep learning with the principled dynamical structure of SSMs, recent studies have achieved powerful fits to functional neuroimaging data. However, most existing approaches still view the brain as a set of loosely connected regions or impose oversimplified network priors, falling short of a truly holistic and self-organized dynamical system perspective. Brain functional connectivity (FC) at each time point naturally forms a symmetric positive definite (SPD) matrix, which resides on a curved Riemannian manifold rather than in Euclidean space. Capturing the trajectories of these SPD matrices is key to understanding how coordinated networks support cognition and behavior. To this end, we introduce GeoDynamics, a geometric state-space neural network that tracks latent brain-state trajectories directly on the high-dimensional SPD manifold. GeoDynamics embeds each connectivity matrix into a manifold-aware recurrent framework, learning smooth and geometry-respecting transitions that reveal task-driven state changes and early markers of Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and autism.

In this setting, model merging offers a practical mechanism for integrating multiple RL-trained agents from different tasks into a single generalist model. However, existing merging methods are designed for supervised fine-tuning (SFT), and they are suboptimal to preserve task-specific capabilities on RL-trained agentic models. The root is a task-vector mismatch between RL and SFT: on-policy RL induces task vectors that are highly sparse and heterogeneous, whereas SFT-style merging implicitly assumes dense and globally comparable task vectors. When standard global averaging is applied under this mismatch, RL's non-overlapping task vectors that encode critical task-specific behaviors are reduced and parameter updates are diluted. To address this issue, we propose Reinforced Agent Merging (RAM), a distribution-aware merging framework explicitly designed for RL-trained agentic models. RAM disentangles shared and task-specific unique parameter updates, averaging shared components while selectively preserving and rescaling unique ones to counteract parameter update dilution. Experiments across multiple agent domains and model architectures demonstrate that RAM not only surpasses merging baselines, but also unlocks synergistic potential among agents to achieve performance superior to that of specialized agents in their domains.", "AI": {"tldr": "RAM\uff1a\u9488\u5bf9RL\u8bad\u7ec3\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u611f\u77e5\u5408\u5e76\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u79bb\u5171\u4eab\u548c\u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u5b9a\u53c2\u6570\u66f4\u65b0\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4f20\u7edf\u5408\u5e76\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728RL\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u4e0a\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u635f\u5931\u95ee\u9898", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u5408\u5e76\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3b\u8981\u9488\u5bf9\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u4e0d\u9002\u7528\u4e8eRL\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6a21\u578b\u3002RL\u4ea7\u751f\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u5411\u91cf\u7a00\u758f\u4e14\u5f02\u6784\uff0c\u800cSFT\u5408\u5e76\u5047\u8bbe\u5bc6\u96c6\u4e14\u5168\u5c40\u53ef\u6bd4\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6807\u51c6\u5168\u5c40\u5e73\u5747\u4f1a\u7a00\u91caRL\u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u5173\u952e\u884c\u4e3a\u53c2\u6570\u66f4\u65b0", "method": "RAM\uff08Reinforced Agent Merging\uff09\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1\uff09\u89e3\u8026\u5171\u4eab\u548c\u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u72ec\u7279\u53c2\u6570\u66f4\u65b0\uff1b2\uff09\u5bf9\u5171\u4eab\u7ec4\u4ef6\u8fdb\u884c\u5e73\u5747\uff1b3\uff09\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u4fdd\u7559\u5e76\u91cd\u65b0\u7f29\u653e\u72ec\u7279\u7ec4\u4ef6\u4ee5\u62b5\u6d88\u53c2\u6570\u66f4\u65b0\u7a00\u91ca", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u9886\u57df\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u67b6\u6784\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cRAM\u4e0d\u4ec5\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u5408\u5e76\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u8fd8\u80fd\u89e3\u9501\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u95f4\u7684\u534f\u540c\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u5728\u67d0\u4e9b\u9886\u57df\u751a\u81f3\u4f18\u4e8e\u4e13\u95e8\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u4f53", "conclusion": "RAM\u662f\u9488\u5bf9RL\u8bad\u7ec3\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4e13\u95e8\u5408\u5e76\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4efb\u52a1\u5411\u91cf\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u6574\u5408\u591a\u4e2aRL\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u4e13\u95e8\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7684\u6027\u80fd"}}

This incomplete forgetting risks security breaches and disrupts retention balance, especially in IU scenarios. We propose FG-OrIU (\\textbf{F}eature-\\textbf{G}radient \\textbf{Or}thogonality for \\textbf{I}ncremental \\textbf{U}nlearning), the first framework unifying orthogonal constraints on both features and gradients level to achieve deep forgetting, where the forgetting effect is irreversible. FG-OrIU decomposes feature spaces via Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), separating forgetting and remaining class features into distinct subspaces. It then enforces dual constraints: feature orthogonal projection on both forgetting and remaining classes, while gradient orthogonal projection prevents the reintroduction of forgotten knowledge and disruption to remaining classes during updates. Additionally, dynamic subspace adaptation merges newly forgetting subspaces and contracts remaining subspaces, ensuring a stable balance between removal and retention across sequential unlearning tasks.

Code and checkpoints: https://github.com/zuraiqi/neural-organ-transplant", "summary": "We introduce Neural Organ Transplantation (NOT), a modular adaptation framework that enables trained transformer layers to function as reusable transferable checkpoints for domain adaptation. Unlike conventional fine-tuning approaches that tightly couple trained parameters to specific model instances and training data, NOT extracts contiguous layer subsets (\"donor organs\") from pre-trained models, trains them independently on domain-specific data, and saves them as standalone checkpoint files that can be transplanted into compatible recipient models without access to the original training data. Through experiments on three decoder-only transformer architectures spanning 124M to 20B parameters (GPT-2, TinyLlama, and GPT-OSS), we demonstrate that donor transplantation substantially outperforms existing adaptation methods, achieving an order-of-magnitude improvement in perplexity over LoRA while training significantly faster. The method exhibits position dependence, with early insertion positions yielding optimal results. Cross-domain transfer at billion-parameter scale reveals unexpected regularization benefits. These findings demonstrate that transformer middle layers can support efficient modular transfer for decoder-only architectures, enabling privacy-preserving expertise sharing through checkpoint distribution. We note that this approach is currently limited to decoder-only models; preliminary experiments on encoder-based architectures show reduced effectiveness.", "AI": {"tldr": "Neural Organ Transplantation (NOT) \u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u9002\u914d\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u53ef\u5c06\u8bad\u7ec3\u597d\u7684Transformer\u5c42\u4f5c\u4e3a\u53ef\u91cd\u7528\u68c0\u67e5\u70b9\u8fdb\u884c\u8de8\u6a21\u578b\u79fb\u690d\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8eLoRA\u7b49\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u5fae\u8c03\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c06\u8bad\u7ec3\u53c2\u6570\u4e0e\u7279\u5b9a\u6a21\u578b\u5b9e\u4f8b\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u7d27\u5bc6\u8026\u5408\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u548c\u53ef\u91cd\u7528\u6027\u3002NOT\u65e8\u5728\u5b9e\u73b0\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u7684\u4e13\u5bb6\u77e5\u8bc6\u5171\u4eab\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u68c0\u67e5\u70b9\u5206\u53d1\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u9886\u57df\u9002\u914d\u3002", "method": "\u4ece\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6\u8fde\u7eed\u5c42\u5b50\u96c6\uff08\"\u6350\u8d60\u5668\u5b98\"\uff09\uff0c\u5728\u9886\u57df\u7279\u5b9a\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u72ec\u7acb\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u4fdd\u5b58\u4e3a\u72ec\u7acb\u68c0\u67e5\u70b9\u6587\u4ef6\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u79fb\u690d\u5230\u517c\u5bb9\u7684\u63a5\u6536\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u539f\u59cb\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u3002", "result": "\u5728124M\u523020B\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u4e09\u79cd\u4ec5\u89e3\u7801\u5668Transformer\u67b6\u6784\u4e0a\uff0c\u6350\u8d60\u79fb\u690d\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u9002\u914d\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u56f0\u60d1\u5ea6\u6bd4LoRA\u63d0\u5347\u4e00\u4e2a\u6570\u91cf\u7ea7\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u901f\u5ea6\u66f4\u5feb\u3002\u65e9\u671f\u63d2\u5165\u4f4d\u7f6e\u6548\u679c\u6700\u4f73\uff0c\u5341\u4ebf\u53c2\u6570\u89c4\u6a21\u7684\u8de8\u9886\u57df\u8f6c\u79fb\u663e\u793a\u51fa\u610f\u5916\u7684\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u6548\u76ca\u3002", "conclusion": "Transformer\u4e2d\u95f4\u5c42\u652f\u6301\u4ec5\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u67b6\u6784\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u8f6c\u79fb\uff0c\u53ef\u901a\u8fc7\u68c0\u67e5\u70b9\u5206\u53d1\u5b9e\u73b0\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u7684\u4e13\u5bb6\u77e5\u8bc6\u5171\u4eab\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u76ee\u524d\u4ec5\u9650\u4e8e\u4ec5\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5728\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u67b6\u6784\u4e0a\u6548\u679c\u6709\u9650\u3002"}}

One solution is to use machine learning methods to simulate the radiation process to improve computational efficiency. From an operational standpoint, this study investigates critical limitations inherent to hybrid forecasting frameworks that embed deep neural networks into numerical prediction models, with a specific focus on two fundamental bottlenecks: coupling compatibility and long-term integration stability. A residual convolutional neural network is employed to approximate the Rapid Radiative Transfer Model for General Circulation Models (RRTMG) within the global operational system of China Meteorological Administration. We adopted an offline training and online coupling approach. First, a comprehensive dataset is generated through model simulations, encompassing all atmospheric columns both with and without cloud cover. To ensure the stability of the hybrid model, the dataset is enhanced via experience replay, and additional output constraints based on physical significance are imposed. Meanwhile, a LibTorch-based coupling method is utilized, which is more suitable for real-time operational computations. The hybrid model is capable of performing ten-day integrated forecasts as required. A two-month operational reforecast experiment demonstrates that the machine learning emulator achieves accuracy comparable to that of the traditional physical scheme, while accelerating the computation speed by approximately eightfold.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4f7f\u7528\u6b8b\u5dee\u5377\u79ef\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u66ff\u4ee3RRTMG\u8f90\u5c04\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u79bb\u7ebf\u8bad\u7ec3\u5728\u7ebf\u8026\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u5c06\u8ba1\u7b97\u901f\u5ea6\u63d0\u5347\u7ea68\u500d\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b010\u5929\u7a33\u5b9a\u9884\u62a5\u3002", "motivation": "\u8f90\u5c04\u8fc7\u7a0b\u662f\u6570\u503c\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u6700\u8017\u65f6\u7684\u7269\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u63d0\u9ad8\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u5173\u6ce8\u6df7\u5408\u9884\u62a5\u6846\u67b6\u4e2d\u5d4c\u5165\u6df1\u5ea6\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u4e24\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u9650\u5236\uff1a\u8026\u5408\u517c\u5bb9\u6027\u548c\u957f\u671f\u79ef\u5206\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u6b8b\u5dee\u5377\u79ef\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u8fd1\u4f3cRRTMG\u8f90\u5c04\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u79bb\u7ebf\u8bad\u7ec3\u5728\u7ebf\u8026\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u578b\u6a21\u62df\u751f\u6210\u5305\u542b\u6709\u4e91\u548c\u65e0\u4e91\u5927\u6c14\u67f1\u7684\u5b8c\u6574\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u7ecf\u9a8c\u56de\u653e\u589e\u5f3a\u6570\u636e\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u57fa\u4e8e\u7269\u7406\u610f\u4e49\u6dfb\u52a0\u8f93\u51fa\u7ea6\u675f\u3002\u4f7f\u7528\u57fa\u4e8eLibTorch\u7684\u8026\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u65f6\u8ba1\u7b97\u3002", "result": "\u6df7\u5408\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u591f\u5b8c\u621010\u5929\u79ef\u5206\u9884\u62a5\u9700\u6c42\u3002\u4e24\u4e2a\u6708\u7684\u4e1a\u52a1\u56de\u7b97\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u62df\u5668\u8fbe\u5230\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edf\u7269\u7406\u65b9\u6848\u76f8\u5f53\u7684\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5c06\u8ba1\u7b97\u901f\u5ea6\u63d0\u5347\u7ea68\u500d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6210\u529f\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u80fd\u591f\u7a33\u5b9a\u8fd0\u884c10\u5929\u9884\u62a5\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u66ff\u4ee3\u4f20\u7edf\u8f90\u5c04\u65b9\u6848\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u548c\u6548\u7387\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u4e3a\u4e1a\u52a1\u6570\u503c\u9884\u62a5\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u7684\u52a0\u901f\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

However, their strict unidirectional block dependencies introduce irreversibility and sacrifice the global planning capabilities for which diffusion models are renowned. In order to address these issues, we propose Diffusion in Diffusion, a draft-then-refine framework designed to overcome the irreversibility and myopia problems inherent in block diffusion models. Our approach first employs block diffusion to generate rapid drafts using small blocks, then refines these drafts through global bidirectional diffusion with a larger bidirectional receptive field.

Empirical results demonstrate that our approach sets a new benchmark for discrete diffusion models on the OpenWebText dataset.

However, traditional numerical solvers often fall short in meeting real-time performance requirements. To overcome this, we introduce a deep learning-based surrogate model that efficiently simulates transient brain deformation caused by continuous interactions between surgical instruments and the virtual brain geometry. Building on Universal Physics Transformers, our approach operates directly on large-scale mesh data and is trained on an extensive dataset generated from nonlinear finite element simulations, covering a broad spectrum of temporal instrument-tissue interaction scenarios. To reduce the accumulation of errors in autoregressive inference, we propose a stochastic teacher forcing strategy applied during model training. Specifically, training consists of short stochastic rollouts in which the proportion of ground truth inputs is gradually decreased in favor of model-generated predictions. Our results show that the proposed surrogate model achieves accurate and efficient predictions across a range of transient brain deformation scenarios, scaling to meshes with up to 150,000 nodes. The introduced stochastic teacher forcing technique substantially improves long-term rollout stability, reducing the maximum prediction error from 6.7 mm to 3.5 mm. We further integrate the trained surrogate model into an interactive neurosurgical simulation environment, achieving runtimes below 10 ms per simulation step on consumer-grade inference hardware.

Despite extensive research on these individual topics, the relationship between fairness and privacy has received significantly less attention. In this paper, we utilize the information-theoretic measure Chernoff Information to highlight the data-dependent nature of the relationship among the triad of fairness, privacy, and accuracy. We first define Noisy Chernoff Difference, a tool that allows us to analyze the relationship among the triad simultaneously. We then show that for synthetic data, this value behaves in 3 distinct ways (depending on the distribution of the data). We highlight the data distributions involved in these cases and explore their fairness and privacy implications. Additionally, we show that Noisy Chernoff Difference acts as a proxy for the steepness of the fairness-accuracy curves. Finally, we propose a method for estimating Chernoff Information on data from unknown distributions and utilize this framework to examine the triad dynamic on real datasets.

We study pre-operative prediction of clinically meaningful improvement in chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS), defining success as a more than 8.9-point reduction in SNOT-22 at 6 months (MCID). In a prospectively collected cohort where all patients underwent surgery, we ask whether models using only pre-operative clinical data could have identified those who would have poor outcomes, i.e. those who should have avoided surgery. We benchmark supervised ML (logistic regression, tree ensembles, and an in-house MLP) against generative AI (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, Perplexity), giving each the same structured inputs and constraining outputs to binary recommendations with confidence. Our best ML model (MLP) achieves 85 % accuracy with superior calibration and decision-curve net benefit. GenAI models underperform on discrimination and calibration across zero-shot setting. Notably, GenAI justifications align with clinician heuristics and the MLP's feature importance, repeatedly highlighting baseline SNOT-22, CT/endoscopy severity, polyp phenotype, and physchology/pain comorbidities.

Many deep learning models face a persistent trade-off between capturing local spatiotemporal patterns and maintaining informative long-range context when operating on ultralong sequences. We propose EEG-Titans, a dualbranch architecture that incorporates a modern neural memory mechanism for long-context modeling. The model combines sliding-window attention to capture short-term anomalies with a recurrent memory pathway that summarizes slower, progressive trends over time. On the CHB-MIT scalp EEG dataset, evaluated under a chronological holdout protocol, EEG-Titans achieves 99.46% average segment-level sensitivity across 18 subjects. We further analyze safety-first operating points on artifact-prone recordings and show that a hierarchical context strategy extending the receptive field for high-noise subjects can markedly reduce false alarms (down to 0.00 FPR/h in an extreme outlier) without sacrificing sensitivity. These results indicate that memory-augmented long-context modeling can provide robust seizure forecasting under clinically constrained evaluation", "AI": {"tldr": "EEG-Titans\uff1a\u4e00\u79cd\u53cc\u5206\u652f\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u6ed1\u52a8\u7a97\u53e3\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u548c\u5faa\u73af\u8bb0\u5fc6\u901a\u8def\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u766b\u75eb\u53d1\u4f5c\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u5728CHB-MIT\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fbe\u523099.46%\u7684\u5e73\u5747\u6bb5\u7ea7\u654f\u611f\u5ea6", "motivation": "\u766b\u75eb\u53d1\u4f5c\u9884\u6d4b\u9762\u4e34\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u53d1\u4f5c\u524d\u52a8\u6001\u53ef\u80fd\u8de8\u8d8a\u957f\u65f6\u95f4\u8303\u56f4\uff0c\u800c\u4e34\u5e8a\u76f8\u5173\u7279\u5f81\u53ef\u80fd\u5fae\u5999\u4e14\u77ed\u6682\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6355\u83b7\u5c40\u90e8\u65f6\u7a7a\u6a21\u5f0f\u548c\u4fdd\u6301\u957f\u8ddd\u79bb\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4fe1\u606f\u4e4b\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u6743\u8861\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faEEG-Titans\u53cc\u5206\u652f\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u73b0\u4ee3\u795e\u7ecf\u8bb0\u5fc6\u673a\u5236\u8fdb\u884c\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5efa\u6a21\u3002\u4f7f\u7528\u6ed1\u52a8\u7a97\u53e3\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6355\u83b7\u77ed\u671f\u5f02\u5e38\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u91c7\u7528\u5faa\u73af\u8bb0\u5fc6\u901a\u8def\u603b\u7ed3\u968f\u65f6\u95f4\u63a8\u79fb\u7684\u7f13\u6162\u6e10\u8fdb\u8d8b\u52bf\u3002", "result": "\u5728CHB-MIT\u5934\u76aeEEG\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u6309\u65f6\u95f4\u987a\u5e8f\u4fdd\u7559\u534f\u8bae\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0cEEG-Titans\u572818\u540d\u53d7\u8bd5\u8005\u4e2d\u8fbe\u523099.46%\u7684\u5e73\u5747\u6bb5\u7ea7\u654f\u611f\u5ea6\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u5c42\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7b56\u7565\u6269\u5c55\u9ad8\u566a\u58f0\u53d7\u8bd5\u8005\u7684\u611f\u53d7\u91ce\uff0c\u53ef\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u8bef\u62a5\uff08\u6781\u7aef\u5f02\u5e38\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u964d\u81f30.00 FPR/h\uff09\u800c\u4e0d\u727a\u7272\u654f\u611f\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bb0\u5fc6\u589e\u5f3a\u7684\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5efa\u6a21\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u4e34\u5e8a\u7ea6\u675f\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0b\u63d0\u4f9b\u7a33\u5065\u7684\u766b\u75eb\u53d1\u4f5c\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u8fd9\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u5e73\u8861\u5c40\u90e8\u7279\u5f81\u6355\u83b7\u548c\u957f\u8ddd\u79bb\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5efa\u6a21\u7684\u9700\u6c42\u3002"}}

Many state-of-the-art forecasters rely on self-attention or its variants to capture multivariate correlations, typically incurring $\\mathcal{O}(N^2)$ computational complexity with respect to the number of variates $N$. To address this, we propose vecTrans, a lightweight module that utilizes a learnable vector to model multivariate correlations, reducing the complexity to $\\mathcal{O}(N)$. Notably, vecTrans can be seamlessly integrated into Transformer-based forecasters, delivering up to 5$\\times$ inference speedups and consistent performance gains. Furthermore, we introduce WFMLoss (Weighted Flow Matching Loss) as the objective. In contrast to typical \\textbf{velocity-oriented} flow matching objectives, we demonstrate that a \\textbf{final-series-oriented} formulation yields significantly superior forecasting accuracy. WFMLoss also incorporates path- and horizon-weighted strategies to focus learning on more reliable paths and horizons. Empirically, vLinear achieves state-of-the-art performance across 22 benchmarks and 124 forecasting settings.

Inspired by latent diffusion in other modalities, a natural idea is to compress graphs into a low-dimensional latent space and perform diffusion there. However, unlike images or text, graph generation requires nearly lossless reconstruction, as even a single error in decoding an adjacency matrix can render the entire sample invalid. This challenge has remained largely unaddressed. We propose LG-Flow, a latent graph diffusion framework that directly overcomes these obstacles. A permutation-equivariant autoencoder maps each node into a fixed-dimensional embedding from which the full adjacency is provably recoverable, enabling near-lossless reconstruction for both undirected graphs and DAGs.

As autonomous driving and intelligent transportation systems become increasingly prevalent, the need for accurate and reliable ETA estimation has grown, playing a vital role in navigation, mobility planning, and traffic management. However, predicting ETA remains a challenging task due to the dynamic and complex nature of traffic flow. Traditional methods often combine real-time and historical traffic data in simplistic ways, or rely on complex rule-based computations. While recent deep learning models have shown potential, they often require high computational costs and do not effectively capture the spatio-temporal patterns crucial for ETA prediction. ETA prediction inherently involves spatio-temporal causality, and our proposed model addresses this by leveraging attention mechanisms to extract and utilize temporal features accumulated at each spatio-temporal point along a route. This architecture enables efficient and accurate ETA estimation while keeping the model lightweight and scalable. We validate our approach using real-world driving datasets and demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing baselines by effectively integrating road characteristics, real-time traffic conditions, and historical speed patterns in a task-aware manner.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u7684ETA\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5386\u53f2\u9053\u8def\u901f\u5ea6\u6a21\u5f0f\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u5230\u8fbe\u65f6\u95f4\u4f30\u8ba1", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u548c\u667a\u80fd\u4ea4\u901a\u7cfb\u7edf\u666e\u53ca\uff0c\u51c6\u786e\u53ef\u9760\u7684ETA\u9884\u6d4b\u5728\u5bfc\u822a\u3001\u51fa\u884c\u89c4\u5212\u548c\u4ea4\u901a\u7ba1\u7406\u4e2d\u53d8\u5f97\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u7531\u4e8e\u4ea4\u901a\u6d41\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u590d\u6742\u6027\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u8981\u4e48\u7b80\u5355\u7ec4\u5408\u5b9e\u65f6\u548c\u5386\u53f2\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u8981\u4e48\u4f9d\u8d56\u590d\u6742\u89c4\u5219\uff0c\u800c\u73b0\u6709\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u4e14\u672a\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u6355\u6349\u65f6\u7a7a\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u7684ETA\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u63d0\u53d6\u548c\u5229\u7528\u6cbf\u8def\u7ebf\u6bcf\u4e2a\u65f6\u7a7a\u70b9\u7d2f\u79ef\u7684\u65f6\u7a7a\u7279\u5f81\u3002\u8be5\u67b6\u6784\u80fd\u591f\u9ad8\u6548\u51c6\u786e\u5730\u4f30\u8ba1ETA\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u6a21\u578b\u8f7b\u91cf\u5316\u548c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u4f7f\u7528\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u9a7e\u9a76\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u6574\u5408\u9053\u8def\u7279\u5f81\u3001\u5b9e\u65f6\u4ea4\u901a\u6761\u4ef6\u548c\u5386\u53f2\u901f\u5ea6\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u7684ETA\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65f6\u7a7a\u56e0\u679c\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u5230\u8fbe\u65f6\u95f4\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u4e3a\u5bfc\u822a\u548c\u4ea4\u901a\u7ba1\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u9760\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

To address these, we propose ELSA (Efficient LLM-centric Split Aggregation), a novel framework that systematically integrates split learning (SL) and hierarchical federated learning (HFL) for distributed LLM fine-tuning over resource-constrained edge networks. ELSA introduces three key innovations. First, it employs a task-agnostic, behavior-aware client clustering mechanism that constructs semantic fingerprints using public probe inputs and symmetric KL divergence, further enhanced by prediction-consistency-based trust scoring and latency-aware edge assignment to jointly address data heterogeneity, client unreliability, and communication constraints. Second, it splits the LLM into three parts across clients and edge servers, with the cloud used only for adapter aggregation, enabling an effective balance between on-device computation cost and global convergence stability. Third, it incorporates a lightweight communication scheme based on computational sketches combined with semantic subspace orthogonal perturbation (SS-OP) to reduce communication overhead while mitigating privacy leakage during model exchanges. Experiments across diverse NLP tasks demonstrate that ELSA consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of adaptability, convergence behavior, and robustness, establishing a scalable and privacy-aware solution for edge-side LLM fine-tuning under resource constraints.", "AI": {"tldr": "ELSA\u6846\u67b6\u7ed3\u5408\u5206\u5272\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u5206\u5c42\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u805a\u7c7b\u3001\u6a21\u578b\u5206\u5272\u548c\u8f7b\u91cf\u901a\u4fe1\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5728\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u7684\u8fb9\u7f18\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u9ad8\u6548\u5fae\u8c03\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "motivation": "\u8fb9\u7f18\u8bbe\u5907\u8bad\u7ec3\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u9762\u4e34\u4e09\u5927\u6311\u6218\uff1a\u8bbe\u5907\u8d44\u6e90\u9650\u5236\u3001\u6570\u636e\u5f02\u6784\u6027\u548c\u9690\u79c1\u98ce\u9669\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u540c\u65f6\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e9b\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u652f\u6301\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u8fb9\u7f18\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u5f0fLLM\u5fae\u8c03\u3002", "method": "1. \u4efb\u52a1\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u611f\u77e5\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u805a\u7c7b\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u516c\u5171\u63a2\u9488\u8f93\u5165\u548c\u5bf9\u79f0KL\u6563\u5ea6\u6784\u5efa\u8bed\u4e49\u6307\u7eb9\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u9884\u6d4b\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u4fe1\u4efb\u8bc4\u5206\u548c\u5ef6\u8fdf\u611f\u77e5\u8fb9\u7f18\u5206\u914d\uff1b2. \u5c06LLM\u5206\u5272\u4e3a\u4e09\u90e8\u5206\u5206\u5e03\u5728\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u548c\u8fb9\u7f18\u670d\u52a1\u5668\uff0c\u4e91\u7aef\u4ec5\u7528\u4e8e\u9002\u914d\u5668\u805a\u5408\uff1b3. \u57fa\u4e8e\u8ba1\u7b97\u8349\u56fe\u7ed3\u5408\u8bed\u4e49\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u6b63\u4ea4\u6270\u52a8\u7684\u8f7b\u91cf\u901a\u4fe1\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u79cdNLP\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cELSA\u5728\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u3001\u6536\u655b\u884c\u4e3a\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u6301\u7eed\u4f18\u4e8e\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e3a\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u7684\u8fb9\u7f18\u4fa7LLM\u5fae\u8c03\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u4e14\u9690\u79c1\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "conclusion": "ELSA\u901a\u8fc7\u7cfb\u7edf\u96c6\u6210\u5206\u5272\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u5206\u5c42\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u8fb9\u7f18LLM\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u8d44\u6e90\u7ea6\u675f\u3001\u6570\u636e\u5f02\u6784\u548c\u9690\u79c1\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u8fb9\u7f18\u667a\u80fd\u4e2d\u7684\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u90e8\u7f72\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u6846\u67b6\u3002"}}

We derive a closed-form expression for the expected generalization loss in the high-dimensional regime that holds for arbitrary linear teachers. We demonstrate that isotropic regularization mitigates label noise under both single-teacher and multiple i.i.d. teacher settings, whereas prior work accommodating multiple teachers either did not employ regularization or used memory-demanding methods.

In this work, we show that the activation pattern of a SOM - the squared distances to its prototypes - can be inverted to recover the exact input under mild geometric conditions. This follows from a classical fact in Euclidean distance geometry: a point in $D$ dimensions is uniquely determined by its distances to $D{+}1$ affinely independent references. We derive the corresponding linear system and characterize the conditions under which the inversion is well-posed. Building upon this mechanism, we introduce the Manifold-Aware Unified SOM Inversion and Control (MUSIC) update rule, which enables controlled, semantically meaningful trajectories in latent space. MUSIC modifies squared distances to selected prototypes while preserving others, resulting in a deterministic geometric flow aligned with the SOM's piecewise-linear structure. Tikhonov regularization stabilizes the update rule and ensures smooth motion on high-dimensional datasets. Unlike variational or probabilistic generative models, MUSIC does not rely on sampling, latent priors, or encoder-decoder architectures. If no perturbation is applied, inversion recovers the exact input; when a target cluster or prototype is specified, MUSIC produces coherent semantic variations while remaining on the data manifold. This leads to a new perspective on data augmentation and controllable latent exploration based solely on prototype geometry. We validate the approach using synthetic Gaussian mixtures, the MNIST and the Faces in the Wild dataset. Across all settings, MUSIC produces smooth, interpretable trajectories that reveal the underlying geometry of the learned manifold, illustrating the advantages of SOM-based inversion over unsupervised clustering.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faMUSIC\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u81ea\u7ec4\u7ec7\u6620\u5c04(SOM)\u7684\u539f\u578b\u8ddd\u79bb\u51e0\u4f55\u7279\u6027\u5b9e\u73b0\u7cbe\u786e\u8f93\u5165\u6062\u590d\u548c\u53ef\u63a7\u8bed\u4e49\u8f68\u8ff9\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u91c7\u6837\u3001\u5148\u9a8c\u6216\u7f16\u7801\u5668-\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u67b6\u6784\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edfSOM\u4e3b\u8981\u7528\u4e8e\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\u548c\u805a\u7c7b\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u6fc0\u6d3b\u6a21\u5f0f\uff08\u5230\u539f\u578b\u7684\u5e73\u65b9\u8ddd\u79bb\uff09\u5305\u542b\u8db3\u591f\u4fe1\u606f\u6765\u7cbe\u786e\u6062\u590d\u8f93\u5165\u3002\u5229\u7528\u6b27\u6c0f\u8ddd\u79bb\u51e0\u4f55\u539f\u7406\uff0c\u63a2\u7d22\u5982\u4f55\u57fa\u4e8eSOM\u539f\u578b\u5b9e\u73b0\u6570\u636e\u6062\u590d\u548c\u53ef\u63a7\u8bed\u4e49\u64cd\u4f5c\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8eD+1\u4e2a\u4eff\u5c04\u72ec\u7acb\u53c2\u8003\u70b9\u7684\u8ddd\u79bb\u552f\u4e00\u786e\u5b9aD\u7ef4\u70b9\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u539f\u7406\uff0c\u63a8\u5bfc\u7ebf\u6027\u7cfb\u7edf\u5e76\u5206\u6790\u53cd\u6f14\u6761\u4ef6\u3002\u63d0\u51faMUSIC\u66f4\u65b0\u89c4\u5219\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4fee\u6539\u9009\u5b9a\u539f\u578b\u7684\u5e73\u65b9\u8ddd\u79bb\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u5176\u4ed6\u8ddd\u79bb\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u51e0\u4f55\u6d41\u3002\u4f7f\u7528Tikhonov\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u7a33\u5b9a\u66f4\u65b0\u89c4\u5219\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5408\u6210\u9ad8\u65af\u6df7\u5408\u3001MNIST\u548cFaces in the Wild\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0cMUSIC\u80fd\u751f\u6210\u5e73\u6ed1\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\u6d41\u5f62\u7684\u5e95\u5c42\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u7cbe\u786e\u8f93\u5165\u6062\u590d\u548c\u53ef\u63a7\u8bed\u4e49\u53d8\u5316\u3002", "conclusion": "SOM\u6fc0\u6d3b\u6a21\u5f0f\u5305\u542b\u8db3\u591f\u4fe1\u606f\u7528\u4e8e\u7cbe\u786e\u8f93\u5165\u6062\u590d\u548c\u53ef\u63a7\u8bed\u4e49\u64cd\u4f5c\uff0cMUSIC\u4e3a\u57fa\u4e8e\u539f\u578b\u51e0\u4f55\u7684\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u548c\u6f5c\u5728\u63a2\u7d22\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u89c6\u89d2\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86SOM\u53cd\u6f14\u76f8\u6bd4\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u805a\u7c7b\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\u3002"}}

Conventional strategies rank high in benchmarks due to their intrinsic capabilities to handle numerical inputs and careful modelling choices that balance exploration and Pareto-front exploitation, as well as handle multiple (conflicting) objectives. In this paper, we close this gap by leveraging LLMs as surrogate models and candidate samplers inside a structured hierarchical search strategy. By adaptively partitioning the input space into disjoint hyperrectangular regions and ranking them with a composite score function, we restrict the generative process of the LLM to specific, high-potential sub-spaces, hence making the problem easier to solve as the LLM doesn't have to reason about the global structure of the problem, but only locally instead. We show that under standard regularity assumptions, our algorithm generates candidate solutions that converge to the true Pareto set in Hausdorff distance.

Although traditional methods relied mainly on classical deterministic and probabilistic approaches, recent progress has benefited from supervised deep learning (DL) and deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to improve tract reconstruction. A persistent challenge in tractography is accurately reconstructing white matter tracts while minimizing spurious connections. To address this, we propose TractRLFusion, a novel GPT-based policy fusion framework that integrates multiple RL policies through a data-driven fusion strategy. Our method employs a two-stage training data selection process for effective policy fusion, followed by a multi-critic fine-tuning phase to enhance robustness and generalization.

Although this paradigm is promising for utilizing unlabeled data, static or random augmentation strategies often fail to preserve intrinsic information due to the non-stationarity of EEG signals where statistical properties change over time. To address this, we propose RL-BioAug, a framework that leverages a label-efficient reinforcement learning (RL) agent to autonomously determine optimal augmentation policies. While utilizing only a minimal fraction (10\\%) of labeled data to guide the agent's policy, our method enables the encoder to learn robust representations in a strictly self-supervised manner. Experimental results demonstrate that RL-BioAug significantly outperforms the random selection strategy, achieving substantial improvements of 9.69\\% and 8.80\\% in Macro-F1 score on the Sleep-EDFX and CHB-MIT datasets, respectively. Notably, this agent mainly chose optimal strategies for each task -- for example, Time Masking with a 62\\% probability for sleep stage classification and Crop \\& Resize with a 77\\% probability for seizure detection. Our framework suggests its potential to replace conventional heuristic-based augmentations and establish a new autonomous paradigm for data augmentation.

We introduce Linearized Subspace Refinement (LSR), a general and architecture-agnostic framework that exploits the Jacobian-induced linear residual model at a fixed trained network state. By solving a reduced direct least-squares problem within this subspace, LSR computes a subspace-optimal solution of the linearized residual model, yielding a refined linear predictor with substantially improved accuracy over standard gradient-trained solutions, without modifying network architectures, loss formulations, or training procedures. Across supervised function approximation, data-driven operator learning, and physics-informed operator fine-tuning, we show that gradient-based training often fails to access this attainable accuracy, even when local linearization yields a convex problem. This observation indicates that loss-induced numerical ill-conditioning, rather than nonconvexity or model expressivity, can constitute a dominant practical bottleneck. In contrast, one-shot LSR systematically exposes accuracy levels not fully exploited by gradient-based training, frequently achieving order-of-magnitude error reductions. For operator-constrained problems with composite loss structures, we further introduce Iterative LSR, which alternates one-shot LSR with supervised nonlinear alignment, transforming ill-conditioned residual minimization into numerically benign fitting steps and yielding accelerated convergence and improved accuracy.

This paper proposes a machine learning-based framework for like-for-like operational assessment of internal combustion engine vehicles (ICEVs) and electric vehicles (EVs) under identical, real-world driving conditions. The approach isolates technology-specific effects by holding the observed speed profile and environmental context fixed, enabling direct comparison of powertrain performance. Recurrent neural network models are trained independently for each domain to learn the mapping from contextual driving variables (speed, acceleration, temperature) to internal actuation variables (torque, throttle) and instantaneous CO2-equivalent emission rates. This structure allows the construction of counterfactual scenarios that answer: What emissions would an EV have generated if it had followed the same driving profile as an ICEV? By aligning both vehicle types on a unified instantaneous emissions metric, the framework enables fair and reproducible evaluation of powertrain technologies.

This renders standard weight-privatization methods (e.g. DP-SGD) unnecessarily noisy at the cost of utility. While model weights may vary significantly across training datasets, model responses to specific inputs are much lower dimensional and more stable. This motivates enforcing privacy guarantees directly on model outputs.\n  We approach this under PAC privacy, which provides instance-based privacy guarantees for arbitrary black-box functions by controlling mutual information (MI). Importantly, PAC privacy explicitly rewards output stability with reduced noise levels. However, a central challenge remains: response privacy requires composing a large number of adaptively chosen, potentially adversarial queries issued by untrusted users, where existing composition results on PAC privacy are inadequate. We introduce a new algorithm that achieves adversarial composition via adaptive noise calibration and prove that mutual information guarantees accumulate linearly under adaptive and adversarial querying.\n  Experiments across tabular, vision, and NLP tasks show that our method achieves high utility at extremely small per-query privacy budgets. On CIFAR-10, we achieve 87.79% accuracy with a per-step MI budget of $2^{-32}$. This enables serving one million queries while provably bounding membership inference attack (MIA) success rates to 51.08% -- the same guarantee of $(0.04, 10^{-5})$-DP. Furthermore, we show that private responses can be used to label public data to distill a publishable privacy-preserving model; using an ImageNet subset as a public dataset, our model distilled from 210,000 responses achieves 91.86% accuracy on CIFAR-10 with MIA success upper-bounded by 50.49%, which is comparable to $(0.02,10^{-5})$-DP.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8ePAC\u9690\u79c1\u7684API\u90e8\u7f72\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u6a21\u578b\u8f93\u51fa\u5c42\u9762\u800c\u975e\u6743\u91cd\u5c42\u9762\u5b9e\u65bd\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u7528\u548c\u5f3a\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u8bc1\u7684\u5e73\u8861\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u4ee3\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u8d8a\u6765\u8d8a\u591a\u5730\u901a\u8fc7API\u90e8\u7f72\uff0c\u8fd9\u4f7f\u5f97\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u6743\u91cd\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u5982DP-SGD\uff09\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u6548\u7528\u65b9\u9762\u4ea7\u751f\u4e0d\u5fc5\u8981\u7684\u566a\u58f0\u3002\u6a21\u578b\u6743\u91cd\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u95f4\u53d8\u5316\u5f88\u5927\uff0c\u4f46\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u7279\u5b9a\u8f93\u5165\u7684\u53cd\u5e94\u7ef4\u5ea6\u66f4\u4f4e\u4e14\u66f4\u7a33\u5b9a\uff0c\u8fd9\u4fc3\u4f7f\u76f4\u63a5\u5728\u6a21\u578b\u8f93\u51fa\u5c42\u9762\u5b9e\u65bd\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528PAC\u9690\u79c1\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u63a7\u5236\u4e92\u4fe1\u606f\uff08MI\uff09\u4e3a\u4efb\u610f\u9ed1\u76d2\u51fd\u6570\u63d0\u4f9b\u57fa\u4e8e\u5b9e\u4f8b\u7684\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u8bc1\u3002\u5f15\u5165\u65b0\u7b97\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u566a\u58f0\u6821\u51c6\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u7ec4\u5408\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5728\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u548c\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u67e5\u8be2\u4e0b\u4e92\u4fe1\u606f\u4fdd\u8bc1\u7ebf\u6027\u7d2f\u79ef\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u8868\u683c\u3001\u89c6\u89c9\u548cNLP\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6781\u5c0f\u7684\u6bcf\u67e5\u8be2\u9690\u79c1\u9884\u7b97\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u7528\u3002\u5728CIFAR-10\u4e0a\u8fbe\u523087.79%\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u6bcf\u6b65MI\u9884\u7b97\u4e3a2^{-32}\u3002\u80fd\u591f\u670d\u52a1100\u4e07\u6b21\u67e5\u8be2\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u53ef\u8bc1\u660e\u5730\u5c06\u6210\u5458\u63a8\u7406\u653b\u51fb\u6210\u529f\u7387\u9650\u5236\u572851.08%\u2014\u2014\u76f8\u5f53\u4e8e(0.04, 10^{-5})-DP\u4fdd\u8bc1\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u79c1\u6709\u54cd\u5e94\u6807\u8bb0\u516c\u5171\u6570\u636e\u84b8\u998f\u51fa\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u5728CIFAR-10\u4e0a\u8fbe\u523091.86%\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0cMIA\u6210\u529f\u7387\u4e0a\u9650\u4e3a50.49%\uff0c\u76f8\u5f53\u4e8e(0.02,10^{-5})-DP\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u6a21\u578b\u8f93\u51fa\u5c42\u9762\u5b9e\u65bdPAC\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86API\u90e8\u7f72\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6548\u7528\u548c\u9690\u79c1\u7684\u4f18\u5f02\u5e73\u8861\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u67e5\u8be2\u670d\u52a1\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u4f9b\u5f3a\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u8bc1\uff0c\u5e76\u80fd\u84b8\u998f\u51fa\u53ef\u53d1\u5e03\u7684\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u6a21\u578b\u3002"}}

We present LLMOrbit, a comprehensive circular taxonomy navigating the landscape of large language models spanning 2019-2025. This survey examines over 50 models across 15 organizations through eight interconnected orbital dimensions, documenting architectural innovations, training methodologies, and efficiency patterns defining modern LLMs, generative AI, and agentic systems. We identify three critical crises: (1) data scarcity (9-27T tokens depleted by 2026-2028), (2) exponential cost growth ($3M to $300M+ in 5 years), and (3) unsustainable energy consumption (22x increase), establishing the scaling wall limiting brute-force approaches. Our analysis reveals six paradigms breaking this wall: (1) test-time compute (o1, DeepSeek-R1 achieve GPT-4 performance with 10x inference compute), (2) quantization (4-8x compression), (3) distributed edge computing (10x cost reduction), (4) model merging, (5) efficient training (ORPO reduces memory 50%), and (6) small specialized models (Phi-4 14B matches larger models). Three paradigm shifts emerge: (1) post-training gains (RLHF, GRPO, pure RL contribute substantially, DeepSeek-R1 achieving 79.8% MATH), (2) efficiency revolution (MoE routing 18x efficiency, Multi-head Latent Attention 8x KV cache compression enables GPT-4-level performance at <$0.30/M tokens), and (3) democratization (open-source Llama 3 88.6% MMLU surpasses GPT-4 86.4%).

Causal feature selection can enhance the performance of soft sensor models in industrial applications. However, existing methods ignore two critical characteristics of industrial processes. Firstly, causal relationships between variables always involve time delays, whereas most causal feature selection methods investigate causal relationships in the same time dimension. Secondly, variables in industrial processes are often interdependent, which contradicts the decorrelation assumption of traditional causal inference methods. Consequently, soft sensor models based on existing causal feature selection approaches often lack sufficient accuracy and stability. To overcome these challenges, this paper proposes a causal feature selection framework based on time-delayed cross mapping. Time-delayed cross mapping employs state space reconstruction to effectively handle interdependent variables in causality analysis, and considers varying causal strength across time delay. Time-delayed convergent cross mapping (TDCCM) is introduced for total causal inference, and time-delayed partial cross mapping (TDPCM) is developed for direct causal inference. Then, in order to achieve automatic feature selection, an objective feature selection strategy is presented. The causal threshold is automatically determined based on the model performance on the validation set, and the causal features are then selected. Two real-world case studies show that TDCCM achieves the highest average performance, while TDPCM improves soft sensor stability and performance in the worst scenario.

This limitation introduces significant geometric distortion when representing real-world graphs with inherent non-Euclidean structures (e.g., hierarchies and cycles), degrading representation quality. To overcome this limitation, we introduce the Riemannian Liquid Spatio-Temporal Graph Network (RLSTG), a framework that unifies continuous-time liquid dynamics with the geometric inductive biases of Riemannian manifolds. RLSTG models graph evolution through an Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) formulated directly on a curved manifold, enabling it to faithfully capture the intrinsic geometry of both structurally static and dynamic spatio-temporal graphs. Moreover, we provide rigorous theoretical guarantees for RLSTG, extending stability theorems of LTCs to the Riemannian domain and quantifying its expressive power via state trajectory analysis. Extensive experiments on real-world benchmarks demonstrate that, by combining advanced temporal dynamics with a Riemannian spatial representation, RLSTG achieves superior performance on graphs with complex structures.

To address this limitation, we propose a novel regularization strategy based on local Dirichlet energies defined on small hypercubes centered at the training points. Leveraging pretrained TPBS models, we also introduce two estimators for inference from incomplete samples. Comparative experiments with neural networks demonstrate that TPBS models outperform neural networks in the overfitting regime for most datasets, and maintain competitive performance otherwise.

The two parameters vary with the prompt and the model; they can be interpreted in terms of an elementary noise rate, and the number of plausible erroneous tokens that can be predicted. Our analysis is inspired by an ``effective field theory'' perspective: the LLM's many raw parameters can be reorganized into just two parameters that govern the error rate. We perform extensive empirical tests, using Gemini 2.5 Flash, Gemini 2.5 Pro and DeepSeek R1, and find excellent agreement between the predicted and observed accuracy for a variety of tasks, although we also identify deviations in some cases.

However, these benefits may be negated when customers drive to pick up their orders. This study proposes a Differentiated Pickup Point Offering (DPO) policy that aims to jointly reduce emissions from delivery truck routes and customer travel. Under DPO, each arriving customer is offered a single recommended pickup point, rather than an unrestricted choice among all locations, while retaining the option of home delivery. We study this problem in a dynamic and stochastic setting, where the pickup point offered to each customer depends on previously realized customer locations and delivery choices. To design effective DPO policies, we adopt a reinforcement learning-based approach that accounts for spatial relationships between customers and pickup points and their implications for future route consolidation. Computational experiments show that differentiated pickup point offerings can substantially reduce total carbon emissions. The proposed policies reduce total emissions by up to 9% relative to home-only delivery and by 2% on average compared with alternative policies, including unrestricted pickup point choice and nearest pickup point assignment. Differentiated offerings are particularly effective in dense urban settings with many pickup points and short inter-location distances. Moreover, explicitly accounting for the dynamic nature of customer arrivals and choices is especially important when customers are less inclined to choose pickup point delivery over home delivery.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5dee\u5f02\u5316\u53d6\u8d27\u70b9\u63d0\u4f9b\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e3a\u6bcf\u4f4d\u987e\u5ba2\u63a8\u8350\u5355\u4e2a\u53d6\u8d27\u70b9\u800c\u975e\u65e0\u9650\u5236\u9009\u62e9\uff0c\u8054\u5408\u51cf\u5c11\u914d\u9001\u5361\u8f66\u548c\u987e\u5ba2\u51fa\u884c\u7684\u78b3\u6392\u653e\uff0c\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u968f\u673a\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u4f7f\u7528\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f18\u5316\u63a8\u8350\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "motivation": "\u53d6\u8d27\u70b9\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5bb6\u5ead\u914d\u9001\u7684\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8ba2\u5355\u6574\u5408\u53ef\u4ee5\u7f29\u77ed\u914d\u9001\u8def\u7ebf\u5e76\u63d0\u9ad8\u9996\u6b21\u6295\u9012\u6210\u529f\u7387\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u5f53\u987e\u5ba2\u9a7e\u8f66\u53d6\u8d27\u65f6\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u73af\u5883\u6548\u76ca\u53ef\u80fd\u88ab\u62b5\u6d88\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u7b56\u7565\u6765\u540c\u65f6\u51cf\u5c11\u914d\u9001\u5361\u8f66\u8def\u7ebf\u548c\u987e\u5ba2\u51fa\u884c\u7684\u78b3\u6392\u653e\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5dee\u5f02\u5316\u53d6\u8d27\u70b9\u63d0\u4f9b\u7b56\u7565\uff1a\u4e3a\u6bcf\u4f4d\u5230\u8fbe\u7684\u987e\u5ba2\u63a8\u8350\u5355\u4e2a\u53d6\u8d27\u70b9\uff08\u800c\u975e\u65e0\u9650\u5236\u9009\u62e9\u6240\u6709\u4f4d\u7f6e\uff09\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u7559\u5bb6\u5ead\u914d\u9001\u9009\u9879\u3002\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u968f\u673a\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u8003\u8651\u987e\u5ba2\u4e0e\u53d6\u8d27\u70b9\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u5173\u7cfb\u53ca\u5176\u5bf9\u672a\u6765\u8def\u7ebf\u6574\u5408\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u8ba1\u7b97\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5dee\u5f02\u5316\u53d6\u8d27\u70b9\u63d0\u4f9b\u7b56\u7565\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u603b\u78b3\u6392\u653e\u3002\u76f8\u5bf9\u4e8e\u7eaf\u5bb6\u5ead\u914d\u9001\uff0c\u603b\u6392\u653e\u6700\u591a\u51cf\u5c119%\uff1b\u76f8\u5bf9\u4e8e\u66ff\u4ee3\u7b56\u7565\uff08\u5305\u62ec\u65e0\u9650\u5236\u53d6\u8d27\u70b9\u9009\u62e9\u548c\u6700\u8fd1\u53d6\u8d27\u70b9\u5206\u914d\uff09\uff0c\u5e73\u5747\u51cf\u5c112%\u3002\u5728\u5bc6\u96c6\u57ce\u5e02\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\uff0c\u5f53\u53d6\u8d27\u70b9\u591a\u4e14\u8ddd\u79bb\u77ed\u65f6\uff0c\u5dee\u5f02\u5316\u63d0\u4f9b\u7279\u522b\u6709\u6548\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5dee\u5f02\u5316\u53d6\u8d27\u70b9\u63d0\u4f9b\u7b56\u7565\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u51cf\u5c11\u603b\u78b3\u6392\u653e\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u5bc6\u96c6\u57ce\u5e02\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u3002\u5f53\u987e\u5ba2\u4e0d\u592a\u503e\u5411\u4e8e\u9009\u62e9\u53d6\u8d27\u70b9\u914d\u9001\u800c\u975e\u5bb6\u5ead\u914d\u9001\u65f6\uff0c\u660e\u786e\u8003\u8651\u987e\u5ba2\u5230\u8fbe\u548c\u9009\u62e9\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u7279\u6027\u5c24\u4e3a\u91cd\u8981\u3002"}}

However, standard RL assigns credit only at the level of the final answer, penalizing entire reasoning traces when the outcome is incorrect and uniformly reinforcing all steps when it is correct. As a result, correct intermediate steps may be discouraged in failed traces, while spurious steps may be reinforced in successful ones. We refer to this failure mode as the problem of credit assignment. While a natural remedy is to train a process reward model, accurately optimizing such models to identify corrective reasoning steps remains challenging. We introduce Intervention Training (InT), a training paradigm in which the model performs fine-grained credit assignment on its own reasoning traces by proposing short, targeted corrections that steer trajectories toward higher reward. Using reference solutions commonly available in mathematical reasoning datasets and exploiting the fact that verifying a model-generated solution is easier than generating a correct one from scratch, the model identifies the first error in its reasoning and proposes a single-step intervention to redirect the trajectory toward the correct solution. We then apply supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to the on-policy rollout up to the point of error concatenated with the intervention, localizing error to the specific step that caused failure. We show that the resulting model serves as a far better initialization for RL training. After running InT and subsequent fine-tuning with RL, we improve accuracy by nearly 14% over a 4B-parameter base model on IMO-AnswerBench, outperforming larger open-source models such as gpt-oss-20b.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faIntervention Training (InT)\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8ba9\u6a21\u578b\u81ea\u6211\u4fee\u6b63\u63a8\u7406\u8f68\u8ff9\u4e2d\u7684\u9519\u8bef\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u4fe1\u7528\u5206\u914d\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6570\u5b66\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u6700\u7ec8\u7b54\u6848\u5c42\u9762\u5206\u914d\u4fe1\u7528\uff0c\u4f1a\u60e9\u7f5a\u6574\u4e2a\u63a8\u7406\u8f68\u8ff9\uff08\u5373\u4f7f\u4e2d\u95f4\u6b65\u9aa4\u6b63\u786e\uff09\uff0c\u6216\u5f3a\u5316\u6240\u6709\u6b65\u9aa4\uff08\u5373\u4f7f\u5305\u542b\u9519\u8bef\u6b65\u9aa4\uff09\u3002\u8fd9\u79cd\u7c97\u7c92\u5ea6\u7684\u4fe1\u7528\u5206\u914d\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "method": "InT\u8bad\u7ec3\u8303\u5f0f\uff1a\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u81ea\u8eab\u63a8\u7406\u8f68\u8ff9\u4e0a\u63d0\u51fa\u7b80\u77ed\u3001\u6709\u9488\u5bf9\u6027\u7684\u4fee\u6b63\uff0c\u5f15\u5bfc\u8f68\u8ff9\u83b7\u5f97\u66f4\u9ad8\u5956\u52b1\u3002\u5229\u7528\u6570\u5b66\u63a8\u7406\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e2d\u53ef\u7528\u7684\u53c2\u8003\u89e3\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u8bc6\u522b\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u7684\u7b2c\u4e00\u4e2a\u9519\u8bef\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u5355\u6b65\u5e72\u9884\u5c06\u8f68\u8ff9\u5bfc\u5411\u6b63\u786e\u89e3\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u5bf9\u9519\u8bef\u70b9\u4e4b\u524d\u7684\u8f68\u8ff9\u52a0\u4e0a\u5e72\u9884\u8fdb\u884c\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\u3002", "result": "\u5728IMO-AnswerBench\u4e0a\uff0c\u7ecf\u8fc7InT\u548c\u540e\u7eedRL\u5fae\u8c03\u540e\uff0c4B\u53c2\u6570\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u63d0\u5347\u8fd114%\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8egpt-oss-20b\u7b49\u66f4\u5927\u7684\u5f00\u6e90\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "conclusion": "InT\u901a\u8fc7\u8ba9\u6a21\u578b\u81ea\u6211\u4fee\u6b63\u63a8\u7406\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u4fe1\u7528\u5206\u914d\uff0c\u4e3a\u540e\u7eedRL\u8bad\u7ec3\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u521d\u59cb\u5316\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6570\u5b66\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

We introduce KAGE-Env, a JAX-native 2D platformer that factorizes the observation process into independently controllable visual axes while keeping the underlying control problem fixed. By construction, varying a visual axis affects performance only through the induced state-conditional action distribution of a pixel policy, providing a clean abstraction for visual generalization. Building on this environment, we define KAGE-Bench, a benchmark of six known-axis suites comprising 34 train-evaluation configuration pairs that isolate individual visual shifts. Using a standard PPO-CNN baseline, we observe strong axis-dependent failures, with background and photometric shifts often collapsing success, while agent-appearance shifts are comparatively benign.

Effective optimization requires exploiting the first-order information of the critic, but it is challenging to do so for flow or diffusion policies because direct gradient-based optimization via backpropagation through their multi-step denoising process is numerically unstable. Existing methods work around this either by only using the value and discarding the gradient information, or by relying on approximations that sacrifice policy expressivity or bias the learned policy. QAM sidesteps both of these challenges by leveraging adjoint matching, a recently proposed technique in generative modeling, which transforms the critic's action gradient to form a step-wise objective function that is free from unstable backpropagation, while providing an unbiased, expressive policy at the optimum.

However, existing RL training pipelines are computationally inefficient and resource-intensive, with the rollout phase accounting for over 70% of total training time. Quantized RL training, particularly using FP8 precision, offers a promising approach to mitigating this bottleneck. A commonly adopted strategy applies FP8 precision during rollout while retaining BF16 precision for training. In this work, we present the first comprehensive study of FP8 RL training and demonstrate that the widely used BF16-training + FP8-rollout strategy suffers from severe training instability and catastrophic accuracy collapse under long-horizon rollouts and challenging tasks. Our analysis shows that these failures stem from the off-policy nature of the approach, which introduces substantial numerical mismatch between training and inference. Motivated by these observations, we propose Jet-RL, an FP8 RL training framework that enables robust and stable RL optimization. The key idea is to adopt a unified FP8 precision flow for both training and rollout, thereby minimizing numerical discrepancies and eliminating the need for inefficient inter-step calibration. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of Jet-RL: our method achieves up to 33% speedup in the rollout phase, up to 41% speedup in the training phase, and a 16% end-to-end speedup over BF16 training, while maintaining stable convergence across all settings and incurring negligible accuracy degradation.", "AI": {"tldr": "Jet-RL\uff1a\u9996\u4e2a\u5168\u9762\u7684FP8\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u8bad\u7ec3\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7edf\u4e00\u7684FP8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u6d41\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709BF16\u8bad\u7ec3+FP8 rollout\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u8fbe33%\u7684rollout\u52a0\u901f\u548c16%\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u52a0\u901f\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709RL\u8bad\u7ec3\u7ba1\u9053\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u4e0b\uff0crollout\u9636\u6bb5\u5360\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u95f470%\u4ee5\u4e0a\u3002\u867d\u7136FP8\u91cf\u5316\u8bad\u7ec3\u6709\u671b\u7f13\u89e3\u8fd9\u4e00\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u4f46\u5e38\u7528\u7684BF16\u8bad\u7ec3+FP8 rollout\u7b56\u7565\u5728\u957f\u5e8f\u5217\u548c\u590d\u6742\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u4f1a\u51fa\u73b0\u4e25\u91cd\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u548c\u7cbe\u5ea6\u5d29\u6e83\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faJet-RL\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u7edf\u4e00\u7684FP8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u6d41\u540c\u65f6\u7528\u4e8e\u8bad\u7ec3\u548crollout\uff0c\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u6570\u503c\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u6d88\u9664\u4f4e\u6548\u7684\u8de8\u6b65\u6821\u51c6\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u7a33\u5b9a\u4f18\u5316\u7684FP8 RL\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1Jet-RL\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff1arollout\u9636\u6bb5\u52a0\u901f33%\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u9636\u6bb5\u52a0\u901f41%\uff0c\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u52a0\u901f16%\uff08\u76f8\u6bd4BF16\u8bad\u7ec3\uff09\uff0c\u5728\u6240\u6709\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e2d\u4fdd\u6301\u7a33\u5b9a\u6536\u655b\uff0c\u7cbe\u5ea6\u635f\u5931\u53ef\u5ffd\u7565\u3002", "conclusion": "Jet-RL\u662f\u9996\u4e2a\u5168\u9762\u7684FP8 RL\u8bad\u7ec3\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7edf\u4e00\u7cbe\u5ea6\u6d41\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u6df7\u5408\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u52a0\u901fRL\u8bad\u7ec3\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e3a\u9ad8\u6548RL\u8bad\u7ec3\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}
