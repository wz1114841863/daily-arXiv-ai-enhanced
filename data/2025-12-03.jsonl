Corners are essential low-level features in event-driven computer vision, and novel algorithms utilizing event-based representations, such as Threshold-Ordinal Surface (TOS), have been developed for corner detection. However, the implementation of these algorithms on resource-constrained edge devices is hindered by significant latency, undermining the advantages of EBCs. To address this challenge, a near-memory architecture for efficient TOS updates (NM-TOS) is proposed. This architecture employs a read-write decoupled 8T SRAM cell and optimizes patch update speed through pipelining. Hardware-software co-optimized peripheral circuits and dynamic voltage and frequency scaling (DVFS) enable power and latency reductions. Compared to traditional digital implementations, our architecture reduces latency/energy by 24.7x/1.2x at Vdd = 1.2 V or 1.93x/6.6x at Vdd = 0.6 V based on 65nm CMOS process. Monte Carlo simulations confirm robust circuit operation, demonstrating zero bit error rate at operating voltages above 0.62 V, with only 0.2% at 0.61 V and 2.5% at 0.6 V.

State of the Art compilation techniques achieve mapping through modulo scheduling, a strategy which attempts to minimize the II (Iteration Interval) needed to execute a loop, and they do so usually through well known graph algorithms, such as Max-Clique Enumeration.\n  We address the mapping problem through a SAT formulation, instead, and thus explore the solution space more effectively than current SoA tools. To formulate the SAT problem, we introduce an ad-hoc schedule called the \\textit{kernel mobility schedule} (KMS), which we use in conjunction with the data-flow graph and the architectural information of the CGRA in order to create a set of boolean statements that describe all constraints to be obeyed by the mapping for a given II. We then let the SAT solver efficiently navigate this complex space. As in other SoA techniques, the process is iterative: if a valid mapping does not exist for the given II, the II is increased and a new KMS and set of constraints is generated and solved.\n  Our experimental results show that SAT-MapIt obtains better results compared to SoA alternatives in $47.72\\%$ of the benchmarks explored: sometimes finding a lower II, and others even finding a valid mapping when none could previously be found."}

One popular approach overlays the pharmacophore-shape profile of the known binder to 3D conformations enumerated for each of the library molecules, computes overlaps, and picks a set of diverse library molecules with high overlaps. While this virtual screening workflow has had considerable success in hit diversification, scaffold hopping, and patent busting, it scales poorly with library sizes and restricts candidate generation to existing library compounds. Leveraging recent advances in voxel-based generative modelling, we propose a pharmacophore-based generative model and workflows that address the scaling and fecundity issues of conventional pharmacophore-based virtual screening. We introduce \\emph{VoxCap}, a voxel captioning method for generating SMILES strings from voxelised molecular representations. We propose two workflows as practical use cases as well as benchmarks for pharmacophore-based generation: \\emph{de-novo} design, in which we aim to generate new molecules with high pharmacophore-shape similarities to query molecules, and fast search, which aims to combine generative design with a cheap 2D substructure similarity search for efficient hit identification. Our results show that VoxCap significantly outperforms previous methods in generating diverse \\textit{de-novo} hits. When combined with our fast search workflow, VoxCap reduces computational time by orders of magnitude while returning hits for all query molecules, enabling the search of large libraries that are intractable to search by brute force."}

I propose the SFL Transformer, a novel deep learning model that utilizes a Contextual Gating mechanism (an Intermediate SFL) to modulate the sequence of hidden states within the BERT encoder stack, rather than fusing features at the final output layer. This approach modulates the deep, contextualized semantic features (Hseq) using low-dimensional structural cues (Fstruct). The model is applied to a challenging binary classification task derived from UMAP-reduced lyrical embeddings. The SFL Transformer achieved an Accuracy of 0.9910 and a Macro F1 score of 0.9910, significantly improving the state-of-the-art established by the previously published SFL model (Accuracy 0.9894). Crucially, this Contextual Gating strategy maintained exceptional reliability, with a low Expected Calibration Error (ECE = 0.0081) and Log Loss (0.0489).

However, this approach is not scalable, as it places a heavy load on the sender. This work presents an autonomic algorithm that enables the $n$ processes in a distributed system to build and maintain a spanning tree connecting themselves. In this context, processes are the vertices of the spanning tree. By definition, a spanning tree connects all processes without forming cycles. The proposed algorithm ensures that every vertex in the spanning tree has both an in-degree and the tree depth of at most $log_2 n$. When all processes are correct, the degree of each process is exactly $log_2 n$. A spanning tree is dynamically created from any source process and is transparently reconstructed as processes fail or recover. Up to $n-1$ processes can fail, and the correct processes remain connected through a scalable, functioning spanning tree. To build and maintain the tree, processes use the VCube virtual topology, which also serves as a failure detector. Two broadcast algorithms based on the autonomic spanning tree algorithm are presented: one for best-effort broadcast and one for reliable broadcast.

Starting from only 32 experimental samples in an aerial K439B superalloy castings repair welding case, we first augment physically plausible synthetic data through a three-stage protocol: differentiated noise injection calibrated to process variabilities, enforcement of hard physical constraints, and preservation of inter-parameter relationships. We then employ a nested optimization strategy for constitutive model discovery, where symbolic regression explores equation structures while differential evolution optimizes parameters, followed by intensive parameter refinement using hybrid global-local optimization. The resulting interpretable constitutive equation achieves 88% accuracy in predicting hot-cracking tendency. This equation not only provides quantitative predictions but also delivers explicit physical insight, revealing how thermal, geometric, and metallurgical mechanisms couple to drive cracking-thereby advancing engineers' cognitive understanding of the process.

These centers operate with hardware configurations, software environments, and security requirements that differ substantially from most users' local systems. As a result, users often develop customized digital artifacts that are tightly coupled to a given HPC center. This practice can lead to significant duplication of effort as multiple users independently create similar solutions to common problems. The FAIR Principles offer a framework to address these challenges. Initially designed to improve data stewardship, the FAIR approach has since been extended to encompass software, workflows, models, and infrastructure. By encouraging the use of rich metadata and community standards, FAIR practices aim to make digital artifacts easier to share and reuse, both within and across scientific domains. Many FAIR initiatives have emerged within individual research communities, often aligned by discipline (e.g. bioinformatics, earth sciences). These communities have made progress in adopting FAIR practices, but their domain-specific nature can lead to silos that limit broader collaboration. Thus, we propose that HPC centers play a more active role in fostering FAIR ecosystems that support research across multiple disciplines. This requires designing infrastructure that enables researchers to discover, share, and reuse computational components more effectively. Here, we build on the architecture of the European Open Science Cloud (EOSC) EOSC-Life FAIR Workflows Collaboratory to propose a model tailored to the needs of HPC.

Specifically, too few experts can lead to the overlooking of critical information, while too many can introduce noise. To this end, we propose Ada-MoGE, an adaptive Gaussian Mixture of Experts model. Ada-MoGE integrates spectral intensity and frequency response to adaptively determine the number of experts, ensuring alignment with the input data's frequency distribution. This approach prevents both information loss due to an insufficient number of experts and noise contamination from an excess of experts.

We introduce TokenPowerBench, the first lightweight and extensible benchmark designed for LLM-inference power consumption studies. The benchmark combines (i) a declarative configuration interface covering model choice, prompt set, and inference engine, (ii) a measurement layer that captures GPU-, node-, and system-level power without specialized power meters, and (iii) a phase-aligned metrics pipeline that attributes energy to the prefill and decode stages of every request. These elements make it straight-forward to explore the power consumed by an LLM inference run; furthermore, by varying batch size, context length, parallelism strategy and quantization, users can quickly assess how each setting affects joules per token and other energy-efficiency metrics. We evaluate TokenPowerBench on four of the most widely used model series (Llama, Falcon, Qwen, and Mistral).

While Transformer-based models effectively capture long-range dependencies, they often suffer from quadratic complexity and overfitting due to data sparsity.

Furthermore, existing multi-scale frameworks typically rely on average pooling, which acts as a non-ideal low-pass filter, leading to spectral aliasing and the irreversible loss of high-frequency transients. In response, this paper proposes DPWMixer, a computationally efficient Dual-Path architecture. The framework is built upon a Lossless Haar Wavelet Pyramid that replaces traditional pooling, utilizing orthogonal decomposition to explicitly disentangle trends and local fluctuations without information loss. To process these components, we design a Dual-Path Trend Mixer that integrates a global linear mapping for macro-trend anchoring and a flexible patch-based MLP-Mixer for micro-dynamic evolution.

However, existing GCL approaches with structural augmentations often struggle to identify task-relevant topological structures, let alone adapt to the varying coarse-to-fine topological granularities required across different downstream tasks. To remedy this issue, we introduce Hierarchical Topological Granularity Graph Contrastive Learning (HTG-GCL), a novel framework that leverages transformations of the same graph to generate multi-scale ring-based cellular complexes, embodying the concept of topological granularity, thereby generating diverse topological views. Recognizing that a certain granularity may contain misleading semantics, we propose a multi-granularity decoupled contrast and apply a granularity-specific weighting mechanism based on uncertainty estimation. Comprehensive experiments on various benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of HTG-GCL, highlighting its superior performance in capturing meaningful graph representations through hierarchical topological information."}

To address three core challenges in real-world scenarios: limited and non-IID data, effective extraction and fusion of multi-modal information, and susceptibility to catastrophic forgetting in model learning, a task-driven supervised multi-modal federated feature extraction method is proposed. The method integrates multi-modal information extraction and contrastive learning mechanisms, and can adapt to different neural network structures as the latent mapping functions for data of each modality. It supports each client to independently learn low-dimensional representations of multi-modal data, and can flexibly control the degree of retention of effective information about the response variable in the predictive variables within the low-dimensional features through parameter tuning. The multi-constraint learning framework constructed by the method guarantees regression accuracy using Mean Squared Error loss. Through the synergistic effect of mutual information preservation constraint, symmetric Kullback-Leibler divergence constraint, and inter-model contrastive constraint, it achieves the retention of task-related information, the extraction, fusion, and alignment of multi-modal features, and the mitigation of representation drift and catastrophic forgetting in non-IID scenarios, respectively. This ensures that the feature extraction process always centers on improving the performance of downstream regression tasks. Experimental results from simulations and real-world data analysis demonstrate that the proposed method achieves more significant performance improvement on downstream regression tasks compared with classical feature extraction techniques."}

This paper offers a thorough analysis of four pricing algorithms -- Q-Learning, PSO, Double DQN, and DDPG -- across three classic duopoly models (Logit, Hotelling, Linear) and under various demand-shock regimes created by auto-regressive processes. By utilizing profit- and price-based collusion indices, we investigate how the interactions among algorithms, market structure, and stochastic demand collaboratively influence competitive outcomes. Our findings reveal that reinforcement-learning algorithms often sustain supra-competitive prices under stable demand, with DDPG demonstrating the most pronounced collusive tendencies. Demand shocks produce notably varied effects: Logit markets suffer significant performance declines, Hotelling markets remain stable, and Linear markets experience shock-induced profit inflation. Despite marked changes in absolute performance, the relative rankings of the algorithms are consistent across different environments. These results underscore the critical importance of market structure and demand uncertainty in shaping algorithmic competition, while also contributing to the evolving policy discussions surrounding autonomous pricing behavior."}

Single-lead ECG recording is integrated into both clinical-grade and consumer wearables.

We introduce a novel contrastive learning approach that utilizes an established clinical risk score to adaptively weight negative pairs: clinically-guided contrastive learning. It aligns the similarities of ECG embeddings with clinically meaningful differences between subjects, with an explicit mechanism to handle missing metadata. On 12-lead ECGs from 161K patients in the MIMIC-IV dataset, we pretrain single-lead ECG foundation models at three scales, collectively called CLEF, using only routinely collected metadata without requiring per-sample ECG annotations. We evaluate CLEF on 18 clinical classification and regression tasks across 7 held-out datasets, and benchmark against 5 foundation model baselines and 3 self-supervised algorithms. When pretrained on 12-lead ECG data and tested on lead-I data, CLEF outperforms self-supervised foundation model baselines: the medium-sized CLEF achieves average AUROC improvements of at least 2.6% in classification and average reductions in MAEs of at least 3.2% in regression. Comparing with existing self-supervised learning algorithms, CLEF improves the average AUROC by at least 1.8%. Moreover, when pretrained only on lead-I data for classification tasks, CLEF performs comparably to the state-of-the-art ECGFounder, which was trained in a supervised manner.

In this paper, we introduce InstructLR, a novel framework designed to generate high-quality instruction datasets for LRLs. Our approach integrates LLM-driven text generation with a dual-layer quality filtering mechanism: an automated filtering layer based on retrieval-augmented-generation (RAG)-based n-shot prompting, and a human-in-the-loop validation layer.

In this study, we examine how enhancing fairness through bias mitigation techniques reshapes Shapley-based feature rankings. We quantify changes in feature importance rankings after applying fairness constraints across three datasets: pediatric urinary tract infection risk, direct anticoagulant bleeding risk, and recidivism risk. We also evaluate multiple model classes on the stability of Shapley-based rankings. We find that increasing model fairness across racial subgroups can significantly alter feature importance rankings, sometimes in different ways across groups. These results highlight the need to jointly consider accuracy, fairness, and explainability in model assessment rather than in isolation."}

We show that in the \\emph{testable learning} model of Rubinfeld and Vasilyan [RV23], membership queries cannot decrease the time complexity of testable learning algorithms beyond the complexity of sample-only distribution-specific learning. In the testable learning model, the learner must output a hypothesis whenever the data distribution satisfies a desired property, and if it outputs a hypothesis, the hypothesis must be near-optimal.\n  We give a general reduction from sample-based \\emph{refutation} of boolean concept classes, as presented in [Vadhan17, KL18], to testable learning with queries (TL-Q). This yields lower bounds for TL-Q via the reduction from learning to refutation given in [KL18]. The result is that, relative to a concept class and a distribution family, no $m$-sample TL-Q algorithm can be super-polynomially more time-efficient than the best $m$-sample PAC learner.\n  Finally, we define a class of ``statistical'' MQ algorithms that encompasses many known distribution-specific MQ learners, such as those based on influence estimation or subcube-conditional statistical queries. We show that TL-Q algorithms in this class imply efficient statistical-query refutation and learning algorithms. Thus, combined with known SQ dimension lower bounds, our results imply that these efficient membership query learners cannot be made testable."}

We investigate this by deriving a principled measure of equivariance error that, for convex losses, calculates the percent of total loss attributable to imperfections in learned symmetry. We focus our empirical investigation to 3D-rotation equivariance on high-dimensional molecular tasks (flow matching, force field prediction, denoising voxels) and find that models reduce equivariance error quickly to $\\leq$2\\% held-out loss within 1k-10k training steps, a result robust to model and dataset size. This happens because learning 3D-rotational equivariance is an easier learning task, with a smoother and better-conditioned loss landscape, than the main prediction task. For 3D rotations, the loss penalty for non-equivariant models is small throughout training, so they may achieve lower test loss than equivariant models per GPU-hour unless the equivariant ``efficiency gap'' is narrowed. We also experimentally and theoretically investigate the relationships between relative equivariance error, learning gradients, and model parameters."}

More accurate learning typically requires Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) Boltzmann sampling, but it is time-consuming due to the difficulty of parallelization for more expressive models. To address this limitation, we first propose a new Boltzmann sampler inspired by a quantum-inspired combinatorial optimization called simulated bifurcation (SB). This SB-inspired approach, which we name Langevin SB (LSB), enables parallelized sampling while maintaining accuracy comparable to MCMC. Furthermore, this is applicable not only to RBMs but also to BMs with general couplings. However, LSB cannot control the inverse temperature of the output Boltzmann distribution, which hinders learning and degrades performance. To overcome this limitation, we also developed an efficient method for estimating the inverse temperature during the learning process, which we call conditional expectation matching (CEM). By combining LSB and CEM, we establish an efficient learning framework for BMs with greater expressive power than RBMs. We refer to this framework as sampler-adaptive learning (SAL). SAL opens new avenues for energy-based generative modeling beyond RBMs."}

We study online classification in non-stationary environments and propose Retrieval-Augmented Memory for Online Learning (RAM-OL), a simple extension of stochastic gradient descent that maintains a small buffer of past examples. At each time step, RAM-OL retrieves a few nearest neighbours of the current input in the hidden representation space and updates the model jointly on the current example and the retrieved neighbours. We compare a naive replay variant with a gated replay variant that constrains neighbours using a time window, similarity thresholds, and gradient reweighting, in order to balance fast reuse of relevant past data against robustness to outdated regimes. From a theoretical perspective, we interpret RAM-OL under a bounded drift model and discuss how retrieval can reduce adaptation cost and improve regret constants when patterns recur over time. Empirically, we instantiate RAM-OL on a simple online multilayer perceptron and evaluate it on three real-world data streams derived from electricity pricing, electricity load, and airline delay data. On strongly and periodically drifting streams, RAM-OL improves prequential accuracy by up to about seven percentage points and greatly reduces variance across random seeds, while on a noisy airline stream the gated variant closely matches the purely online baseline. These results show that retrieval-augmented memory is a practical and robust tool for online learning under concept drift."}

To do so, this research considers factors that tend to affect public transportation, such as day of week, season, pressure, wind speed, average temperature, and precipitation. This paper evaluates the performance of 10 statistical and machine learning models on predicting next-day subway usage. On predicting delay count, the number of models is extended to 11 per day by introducing a self-exciting point process model, representing a unique application of a point-process framework for MBTA delay modeling. This research involves experimenting with the selective inclusion of features to determine feature importance, testing model accuracy via Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE). Remarkably, it is found that providing either day of week or season data has a more substantial benefit to predictive accuracy compared to weather data; in fact, providing weather data generally worsens performance, suggesting a tendency of models to overfit."}

Allocating spaces for on-street parking, further hinders traffic flow, by limiting the effective road width available for driving. With the advancement of vehicle-to-infrastructure connectivity technologies, we explore how the impact of on-street parking on traffic congestion could be minimized, by dynamically configuring on-street parking spaces. Towards that end, we formulate dynamic on-street parking space configuration as an optimization problem, and we follow a data driven approach, considering the nature of our problem. Our proposed solution comprises a two-layer multi agent reinforcement learning based framework, which is inherently scalable to large road networks. The lane level agents are responsible for deciding the optimal parking space configuration for each lane, and we introduce a novel Deep Q-learning architecture which effectively utilizes long short term memory networks and graph attention networks to capture the spatio-temporal correlations evident in the given problem. The block level agents control the actions of the lane level agents and maintain a sufficient level of parking around the block. We conduct a set of comprehensive experiments using SUMO, on both synthetic data as well as real-world data from the city of Melbourne.

Commercial Microwave Links (CMLs) are an emerging data source with great potential for this task.While traditional rainfall retrieval from CMLs relies on physicsbased models, these often struggle with real-world complexities like signal noise and nonlinear attenuation. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a novel hybrid deep learning architecture based on the Transformer and a Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Unit (BiGRU), which we name TabGRU. This design synergistically captures both long-term dependencies and local sequential features in the CML signal data. The model is further enhanced by a learnable positional embedding and an attention pooling mechanism to improve its dynamic feature extraction and generalization capabilities. The model was validated on a public benchmark dataset from Gothenburg, Sweden (June-September 2015). The evaluation used 12 sub-links from two rain gauges (Torp and Barl) over a test period (August 22-31) covering approximately 10 distinct rainfall events. The proposed TabGRU model demonstrated consistent advantages, outperforming deep learning baselines and achieving high coefficients of determination (R2) at both the Torp site (0.91) and the Barl site (0.96). Furthermore, compared to the physics-based approach, TabGRU maintained higher accuracy and was particularly effective in mitigating the significant overestimation problem observed in the PL model during peak rainfall events.

In this paper, we investigate dual (both train-time and test-time) robustness against dynamics shifts in cross-domain offline RL. We first empirically show that the policy trained with cross-domain offline RL exhibits fragility under dynamics perturbations during evaluation, particularly when target domain data is limited.

In federated learning (FL) in its naive form, often biases toward certain users, and a single global model fails to capture the statistical heterogeneity across users and BSs. In contrast, the proposed DMTFL algorithm personalizes content delivery by learning individual caching models at each BS. These models are further optimized to perform well under any target distribution, while providing theoretical guarantees via Rademacher complexity and a probably approximately correct (PAC) bound on the loss.

However, executing agents at scale using high-capacity LLMs incurs high inference costs. We propose a simple method for reducing LLM agent inference costs without incurring the development friction costs associated with LLM fine-tuning (long training cycles, optimization hyperparameter tweaking loops) or manual prompt engineering (laborious trial and error). Most importantly, we introduce $\\textit{in-context distillation}$, which adapts the idea of knowledge distillation (training a low cost-student model to mimic a high-cost teacher) to an in-context learning setting. Our approach retrieves relevant teacher demonstrations at each agent step and provides them to the student as in-context examples, enabling the student to imitate teacher behavior on-the-fly. We combine in-context distillation with the established idea of $\\textit{self-consistency cascades}$ to know when the trust the student. This adaptive strategy realizes the cost benefits of model specialization while preserving the productivity of working with frozen models. On the multi-step embodied reasoning benchmark ALFWorld, our method matches teacher-level accuracy at $\\textbf{2.5$\\times$ lower cost}$, reducing per-episode costs from \\$0.059 to \\$0.024.

However, another important aspect of model training - identifying optimal feature hyperparameters - has not been addressed and is typically handled using the standard cross-validation approach. In this paper, we introduce the Feature Learning (FL) model, which addresses this issue by representing tensor-product features as a learnable Canonical Polyadic Decomposition (CPD). By leveraging this CPD structure, we efficiently learn the hyperparameters associated with different features alongside the model parameters using an Alternating Least Squares (ALS) optimization method.

Gaussian policies provide tractable likelihoods and smooth gradients, but their unimodal form limits expressiveness. Conversely, generative policies based on diffusion or flow matching can model rich multimodal behaviors; however, in online RL, they are frequently unstable due to intractable likelihoods and noisy gradients propagating through deep sampling chains. We address this tension with a key structural principle: decoupling optimization from generation. Building on this insight, we introduce GoRL (Generative Online Reinforcement Learning), a framework that optimizes a tractable latent policy while utilizing a conditional generative decoder to synthesize actions. A two-timescale update schedule enables the latent policy to learn stably while the decoder steadily increases expressiveness, without requiring tractable action likelihoods. Across a range of continuous-control tasks, GoRL consistently outperforms both Gaussian policies and recent generative-policy baselines.

To address these challenges, we introduce HeatTransFormer, a physics-guided Transformer architecture for interface-dominated diffusion problems. The framework integrates physically informed spatiotemporal sampling, a Laplace-based activation emulating analytical diffusion solutions, and a mask-free attention mechanism supporting bidirectional spatiotemporal coupling. These components enable the model to resolve steep gradients, maintain physical consistency, and remain stable where PINNs typically fail. HeatTransFormer produces coherent temperature fields across the interface when applied to a finite layer and semi-infinite substrate configuration. Coupled with a physics-constrained inverse strategy, it further enables reliable identification of three unknown thermal properties simultaneously using only external measurements.

In this work, we propose an efficient transfer learning method using a tensor kernel machine.

The main advantage of using tensor kernel machines is that they leverage low-rank tensor networks to learn a compact non-linear model in the primal domain. This allows for a more efficient adaptation without adding more parameters to the model. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, we apply the adaptive tensor kernel machine (Adapt-TKM) to seizure detection on behind-the-ear EEG. By personalizing patient-independent models with a small amount of patient-specific data, the patient-adapted model (which utilizes the Adapt-TKM), achieves better performance compared to the patient-independent and fully patient-specific models. Notably, it is able to do so while requiring around 100 times fewer parameters than the adaptive SVM model, leading to a correspondingly faster inference speed.

First, to reduce perception hallucinations of the visual module of the VLN agent, a dual-view Visual Prompt (VP) technique is introduced in the input space, which can also improve the agent's understanding of current spatial states. Subsequently, a novel step-level Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (RFT) method, Step Reward Group Policy Optimization (SRGPO), is designed for the post-training of VLN agents.

SRGPO provides dense reward signals for the reinforcement learning process of the VLN agent and enhances its planning capability. Experimental results on the EmbodiedBench Navigation benchmark indicate that by introducing the zero-shot VP module, the GPT-4.1 achieves a navigation success rate of 86.7%, surpassing the current best LVLM by approximately 20 percentage points (pp).

Yet paradoxically, some of today's best generative models -- diffusion and flow-based models -- still require hundreds to thousands of neural function evaluations (NFEs) to compute a single likelihood. While recent distillation methods have successfully accelerated sampling to just a few steps, they achieve this at the cost of likelihood tractability: existing approaches either abandon likelihood computation entirely or still require expensive integration over full trajectories. We present fast flow joint distillation (F2D2), a framework that simultaneously reduces the number of NFEs required for both sampling and likelihood evaluation by two orders of magnitude. Our key insight is that in continuous normalizing flows, the coupled ODEs for sampling and likelihood are computed from a shared underlying velocity field, allowing us to jointly distill both the sampling trajectory and cumulative divergence using a single model. F2D2 is modular, compatible with existing flow-based few-step sampling models, and requires only an additional divergence prediction head.

This necessitates machine unlearning (MU) to remove specific concepts without the prohibitive cost of retraining. However, existing MU techniques are fundamentally ill-equipped for real-world scenarios where deletion requests arrive sequentially, a setting known as continual unlearning (CUL). Naively applying one-shot methods in a continual setting triggers a stability crisis, leading to a cascade of degradation characterized by retention collapse, compounding collateral damage to related concepts, and a sharp decline in generative quality. To address this critical challenge, we introduce a novel generative distillation based continual unlearning framework that ensures targeted and stable unlearning under sequences of deletion requests. By reframing each unlearning step as a multi-objective, teacher-student distillation process, the framework leverages principles from continual learning to maintain model integrity. Experiments on a 10-step sequential benchmark demonstrate that our method unlearns forget concepts with better fidelity and achieves this without significant interference to the performance on retain concepts or the overall image quality, substantially outperforming baselines. This framework provides a viable pathway for the responsible deployment and maintenance of large-scale generative models, enabling industries to comply with ongoing data removal requests in a practical and effective manner."}

In this work, we introduce the Graph VQ-Transformer (GVT), a two-stage generative framework that achieves both high accuracy and efficiency. The core of our approach is a novel Graph Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoder (VQ-VAE) that compresses molecular graphs into high-fidelity discrete latent sequences. By synergistically combining a Graph Transformer with canonical Reverse Cuthill-McKee (RCM) node ordering and Rotary Positional Embeddings (RoPE), our VQ-VAE achieves near-perfect reconstruction rates. An autoregressive Transformer is then trained on these discrete latents, effectively converting graph generation into a well-structured sequence modeling problem. Crucially, this mapping of complex graphs to high-fidelity discrete sequences bridges molecular design with the powerful paradigm of large-scale sequence modeling, unlocking potential synergies with Large Language Models (LLMs). Extensive experiments show that GVT achieves state-of-the-art or highly competitive performance across major benchmarks like ZINC250k, MOSES, and GuacaMol, and notably outperforms leading diffusion models on key distribution similarity metrics such as FCD and KL Divergence.

We use this result as inspiration for a novel approach to distribution matching in the latent space, utilising jamming as an auxiliary objective to encourage the aggregated latent posterior to match a diagonal Gaussian distribution. Using this new technique, we achieve distribution matching comparable to standard variational autoencoders and to Wasserstein autoencoders.

Analyzing this oracle velocity field reveals that flow-based diffusion models inherently formulate a two-stage training target: an early stage guided by a mixture of data modes, and a later stage dominated by the nearest data sample. The two-stage objective leads to distinct learning behaviors: the early navigation stage generalizes across data modes to form global layouts, whereas the later refinement stage increasingly memorizes fine-grained details.

To address these limitations, we develop here a novel adaptive DFL (aDFL) approach for robust estimation. The key idea is to adaptively adjust the learning rates of clients. By assigning smaller rates to suspicious clients and larger rates to normal clients, aDFL mitigates the negative impact of abnormal clients on the global model in a fully adaptive way. Our theory does not put any stringent conditions on neighboring nodes and requires no prior knowledge. A rigorous convergence analysis is provided to guarantee the oracle property of aDFL.

This study investigates the performance of multi-fidelity neural emulators, neural networks designed to learn the input-to-output mapping by integrating limited high-fidelity data with abundant low-fidelity model solutions. We investigate the performance of such emulators for low and high-dimensional functions, with oscillatory character, in the presence of discontinuities, for collections of models with equal and dissimilar parametrization, and for a possibly large number of potentially corrupted low-fidelity sources.

Here we present Fairy2i, a universal framework that transforms pre-trained real-valued layers into an equivalent widely-linear complex form, enabling extremely low-bit quantization while reusing existing checkpoints. By proving a lossless mathematical equivalence between real and widely-linear maps, we convert standard Transformers into the complex domain and employ a phase-aware quantization scheme with a highly efficient codebook of fourth roots of unity. Furthermore, we introduce a recursive residual quantization mechanism that iteratively minimizes quantization error, allowing inference to proceed via efficient multiplication-free accumulation. We demonstrate that Fairy2i restores the performance of LLaMA-2 7B at an effective 2-bit precision to levels nearly comparable with full-precision baselines, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art real-valued binary and ternary quantization methods.

The Gaussian process model is a powerful tool commonly used in nonlinear regression applications. Standard regression modeling assumes random samples and an independently, identically distributed noise. Various fast approximations that speed up Gaussian process regression work under this standard setting. But for autocorrelated data, failing to account for autocorrelation leads to a phenomenon known as temporal overfitting that deteriorates model performance on new test instances. To handle autocorrelated data, existing fast Gaussian process approximations have to be modified; one such approach is to segment the originally correlated data points into blocks in which the blocked data are de-correlated. This work explains how to make some of the existing Gaussian process approximations work with blocked data. Numerical experiments across diverse application datasets demonstrate that the proposed approaches can remarkably accelerate computation for Gaussian process regression on autocorrelated data without compromising model prediction performance."}
