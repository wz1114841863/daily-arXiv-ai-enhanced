However, because\nthey have high computational throughput, they can lead to significant\nperformance gains in other algorithms if they can be successfully exploited. We\nexamine using TCs to compute Euclidean distance calculations, which are used in\nmany data analytics applications. Prior work has only investigated using 64 bit\nfloating point (FP64) data for computation; however, TCs can operate on lower\nprecision floating point data (i.e., 16 bit matrix multiplication and 32 bit\naccumulation), which we refer to as FP16-32. FP16-32 TC peak throughput is so\nhigh that TCs are easily starved of data. We propose a Fast and Scalable Tensor\ncore Euclidean Distance (FaSTED) algorithm. To achieve high computational\nthroughput, we design FaSTED for significant hierarchical reuse of data and\nmaximize memory utilization at every level (global memory, shared memory, and\nregisters). We apply FaSTED to the application of similarity searches, which\ntypically employ an indexing data structure to eliminate superfluous Euclidean\ndistance calculations. We compare to the state-of-the-art (SOTA) TC Euclidean\ndistance algorithm in the literature that employs FP64, as well as to two\nsingle precision (FP32) CUDA core algorithms that both employ an index. We find\nthat across four real-world high-dimensional datasets spanning 128-960\ndimensions, the mixed-precision brute force approach achieves a speedup over\nthe SOTA algorithms of 2.5-51x. We also quantify the accuracy loss of our mixed\nprecision algorithm to be less than <0.06% when compared to the FP64 baseline."}

FL can be categorized into centralized and\ndecentralized paradigms. The centralized paradigm relies on a central server to\naggregate local models, potentially resulting in single points of failure,\ncommunication bottlenecks, and exposure of model parameters. In contrast, the\ndecentralized paradigm, which does not require a central server, provides\nimproved robustness and privacy. The essence of federated learning lies in\nleveraging multiple local updates for efficient communication. However, this\napproach may result in slower convergence or even convergence to suboptimal\nmodels in the presence of heterogeneous and imbalanced data. To address this\nchallenge, we study decentralized federated averaging via random walk (DFedRW),\nwhich replaces multiple local update steps on a single device with random walk\nupdates. Traditional Federated Averaging (FedAvg) and its decentralized\nversions commonly ignore stragglers, which reduces the amount of training data\nand introduces sampling bias. Therefore, we allow DFedRW to aggregate partial\nrandom walk updates, ensuring that each computation contributes to the model\nupdate. To further improve communication efficiency, we also propose a\nquantized version of DFedRW. We demonstrate that (quantized) DFedRW achieves\nconvergence upper bound of order $\\mathcal{O}(\\frac{1}{k^{1-q}})$ under convex\nconditions. Furthermore, we propose a sufficient condition that reveals when\nquantization balances communication and convergence. Numerical analysis\nindicates that our proposed algorithms outperform (decentralized) FedAvg in\nboth convergence rate and accuracy, achieving a 38.3\\% and 37.5\\% increase in\ntest accuracy under high levels of heterogeneities."}

Managing such massive data streams presents significant\nchallenges, as transmission and storage infrastructures become prohibitively\nexpensive. Machine learning (ML) offers a promising solution for real-time data\nreduction, but conventional implementations introduce excessive latency, making\nthem unsuitable for high-speed experimental environments. To address these\nchallenges, SLAC developed the SLAC Neural Network Library (SNL), a specialized\nframework designed to deploy real-time ML inference models on\nField-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGA). SNL's key feature is the ability to\ndynamically update model weights without requiring FPGA resynthesis, enhancing\nflexibility for adaptive learning applications. To further enhance usability\nand accessibility, we introduce Auto-SNL, a Python extension that streamlines\nthe process of converting Python-based neural network models into\nSNL-compatible high-level synthesis code. This paper presents a benchmark\ncomparison against hls4ml, the current state-of-the-art tool, across multiple\nneural network architectures, fixed-point precisions, and synthesis\nconfigurations targeting a Xilinx ZCU102 FPGA.

In contrast, sharp minima are typically more\nsensitive and less stable. Motivated by two key empirical observations - the\ninherent heavy-tailed distribution of gradient noise in stochastic gradient\ndescent and the Edge of Stability phenomenon during neural network training, in\nwhich curvature grows before settling at a plateau, we introduce Adaptive Heavy\nTailed Stochastic Gradient Descent (AHTSGD). The algorithm injects\nheavier-tailed noise into the optimizer during the early stages of training to\nenhance exploration and gradually transitions to lighter-tailed noise as\nsharpness stabilizes.
