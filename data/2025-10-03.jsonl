In\nthis paper, we propose RSAVQ, a novel VQ framework to enhance extremely low-bit\nquantization for LLMs. RSAVQ introduces two geometry-driven innovations that\neffectively mitigate above limitations: (1) Error Direction Sensitivity\nGuidance (EDSG), which leverages the Fisher Information Matrix (FIM)-induced\nRiemannian metric to project quantization errors onto low-sensitivity\ndirections in the parameter space.

The submission\n  includes 10 pages and 6 figures", "summary": "Structural vibrations induced by external excitations pose significant risks,\nincluding safety hazards for occupants, structural damage, and increased\nmaintenance costs. While conventional model-based control strategies, such as\nLinear Quadratic Regulator (LQR), effectively mitigate vibrations, their\nreliance on accurate system models necessitates tedious system identification.\nThis tedious system identification process can be avoided by using a model-free\nReinforcement learning (RL) method. RL controllers derive their policies solely\nfrom observed structural behaviour, eliminating the requirement for an explicit\nstructural model. For an RL controller to be truly model-free, its training\nmust occur on the actual physical system rather than in simulation. However,\nduring this training phase, the RL controller lacks prior knowledge and it\nexerts control force on the structure randomly, which can potentially harm the\nstructure. To mitigate this risk, we propose guiding the RL controller using a\nLinear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) controller. While LQR control typically relies\non an accurate structural model for optimal performance, our observations\nindicate that even an LQR controller based on an entirely incorrect model\noutperforms the uncontrolled scenario. Motivated by this finding, we introduce\na hybrid control framework that integrates both LQR and RL controllers. In this\napproach, the LQR policy is derived from a randomly selected model and its\nparameters. As this LQR policy does not require knowledge of the true or an\napproximate structural model the overall framework remains model-free. This\nhybrid approach eliminates dependency on explicit system models while\nminimizing exploration risks inherent in naive RL implementations. As per our\nknowledge, this is the first study to address the critical training safety\nchallenge of RL-based vibration control and provide a validated solution."}

In this paper, we adopt a first-principles\napproach and investigate whether the learning objective of an SSRL algorithm\ndictates its possible optimization strategies and model design choices. In\nparticular, by starting from a variational mutual information (MI) lower bound,\nwe derive two training paradigms, namely Self-Distillation MI (SDMI) and Joint\nMI (JMI), each imposing distinct structural constraints and covering a set of\nexisting SSRL algorithms.

However,\nexisting efforts in assessing LLM's counterfactual reasoning capabilities tend\nto skip the abduction step, effectively reducing to interventional reasoning\nand leading to overestimation of LLM performance.

In this work, we introduce a new task:\ndetecting post-generation edits locally made to watermarked LLM outputs.

To overcome\nthis limitation, we propose GraphNC , a graph normality calibration framework\nthat leverages both labeled and unlabeled data to calibrate the normality from\na teacher model (a pre-trained semi-supervised GAD model) jointly in anomaly\nscore and node representation spaces. GraphNC includes two main components,\nanomaly score distribution alignment (ScoreDA) and perturbation-based normality\nregularization (NormReg). ScoreDA optimizes the anomaly scores of our model by\naligning them with the score distribution yielded by the teacher model. Due to\naccurate scores in most of the normal nodes and part of the anomaly nodes in\nthe teacher model, the score alignment effectively pulls the anomaly scores of\nthe normal and abnormal classes toward the two ends, resulting in more\nseparable anomaly scores.

Approach: The\nGeorge B. Moody PhysioNet Challenge 2025 invites teams to develop algorithmic\napproaches for identifying Chagas disease from electrocardiograms (ECGs). Main\nresults: This Challenge provides multiple innovations. First, we leveraged\nseveral datasets with labels from patient reports and serological testing,\nprovided a large dataset with weak labels and smaller datasets with strong\nlabels. Second, we augmented the data to support model robustness and\ngeneralizability to unseen data sources. Third, we applied an evaluation metric\nthat captured the local serological testing capacity for Chagas disease to\nframe the machine learning problem as a triage task. Significance: Over 630\nparticipants from 111 teams submitted over 1300 entries during the Challenge,\nrepresenting diverse approaches from academia and industry worldwide."}

In this paper, we introduce\nInteractive Training, an open-source framework that enables real-time,\nfeedback-driven intervention during neural network training by human experts or\nautomated AI agents. At its core, Interactive Training uses a control server to\nmediate communication between users or agents and the ongoing training process,\nallowing users to dynamically adjust optimizer hyperparameters, training data,\nand model checkpoints. Through three case studies, we demonstrate that\nInteractive Training achieves superior training stability, reduced sensitivity\nto initial hyperparameters, and improved adaptability to evolving user needs,\npaving the way toward a future training paradigm where AI agents autonomously\nmonitor training logs, proactively resolve instabilities, and optimize training\ndynamics."}

EqM discards the\nnon-equilibrium, time-conditional dynamics in traditional diffusion and\nflow-based generative models and instead learns the equilibrium gradient of an\nimplicit energy landscape. Through this approach, we can adopt an\noptimization-based sampling process at inference time, where samples are\nobtained by gradient descent on the learned landscape with adjustable step\nsizes, adaptive optimizers, and adaptive compute. EqM surpasses the generation\nperformance of diffusion/flow models empirically, achieving an FID of 1.90 on\nImageNet 256$\\times$256. EqM is also theoretically justified to learn and\nsample from the data manifold. Beyond generation, EqM is a flexible framework\nthat naturally handles tasks including partially noised image denoising, OOD\ndetection, and image composition. By replacing time-conditional velocities with\na unified equilibrium landscape, EqM offers a tighter bridge between flow and\nenergy-based models and a simple route to optimization-driven inference."}

This problem is motivated by growing concerns about model\nprovenance and unauthorized replication through distillation. To address this\ntask, we introduce a model-agnostic framework that combines data-free input\nsynthesis and statistical score computation for detecting distillation. Our\napproach is applicable to both classification and generative models.\nExperiments on diverse architectures for image classification and text-to-image\ngeneration show that our method improves detection accuracy over the strongest\nbaselines by 59.6% on CIFAR-10, 71.2% on ImageNet, and 20.0% for text-to-image\ngeneration.

However, the\nmechanisms underpinning these strong capabilities remain only partially\nunderstood. A leading conjecture, based on the manifold hypothesis, attributes\nthis success to their ability to adapt to low-dimensional geometric structure\nwithin the data. This work provides evidence for this conjecture, focusing on\nhow such phenomena could result from the formulation of the learning problem\nthrough score matching. We inspect the role of implicit regularisation by\ninvestigating the effect of smoothing minimisers of the empirical score\nmatching objective. Our theoretical and empirical results confirm that\nsmoothing the score function -- or equivalently, smoothing in the log-density\ndomain -- produces smoothing tangential to the data manifold. In addition, we\nshow that the manifold along which the diffusion model generalises can be\ncontrolled by choosing an appropriate smoothing."}

Robertson", "Gal Mishne", "Alexander Cloninger"], "title": "Robust Tangent Space Estimation via Laplacian Eigenvector Gradient Orthogonalization", "comment": null, "summary": "Estimating the tangent spaces of a data manifold is a fundamental problem in\ndata analysis. The standard approach, Local Principal Component Analysis\n(LPCA), struggles in high-noise settings due to a critical trade-off in\nchoosing the neighborhood size. Selecting an optimal size requires prior\nknowledge of the geometric and noise characteristics of the data that are often\nunavailable. In this paper, we propose a spectral method, Laplacian Eigenvector\nGradient Orthogonalization (LEGO), that utilizes the global structure of the\ndata to guide local tangent space estimation. Instead of relying solely on\nlocal neighborhoods, LEGO estimates the tangent space at each data point by\northogonalizing the gradients of low-frequency eigenvectors of the graph\nLaplacian. We provide two theoretical justifications of our method. First, a\ndifferential geometric analysis on a tubular neighborhood of a manifold shows\nthat gradients of the low-frequency Laplacian eigenfunctions of the tube align\nclosely with the manifold's tangent bundle, while an eigenfunction with high\ngradient in directions orthogonal to the manifold lie deeper in the spectrum.\nSecond, a random matrix theoretic analysis also demonstrates that low-frequency\neigenvectors are robust to sub-Gaussian noise. Through comprehensive\nexperiments, we demonstrate that LEGO yields tangent space estimates that are\nsignificantly more robust to noise than those from LPCA, resulting in marked\nimprovements in downstream tasks such as manifold learning, boundary detection,\nand local intrinsic dimension estimation."}

Under Review", "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at multi-step reasoning problems with\nexplicit chain-of-thought (CoT), but verbose traces incur significant\ncomputational costs and memory overhead, and often carry redundant, stylistic\nartifacts. Latent reasoning has emerged as an efficient alternative that\ninternalizes the thought process, but it suffers from a critical lack of\nsupervision, limiting its effectiveness on complex, natural-language reasoning\ntraces. In this work, we propose KaVa, the first framework that bridges this\ngap by distilling knowledge directly from a compressed KV-cache of the teacher\ninto a latent-reasoning student via self-distillation, leveraging the\nrepresentational flexibility of continuous latent tokens to align stepwise KV\ntrajectories. We show that the abstract, unstructured knowledge within\ncompressed KV-cache, which lacks direct token correspondence, can serve as a\nrich supervisory signal for a latent reasoning student. Empirically, the\napproach consistently outperforms strong latent baselines, exhibits markedly\nsmaller degradation from equation-only to natural-language traces, and scales\nto larger backbones while preserving efficiency. These results establish\ncompressed KV-cache distillation as a scalable supervision signal for latent\nreasoning, combining the accuracy of CoT-trained teachers with the efficiency\nand deployability of latent inference."}
