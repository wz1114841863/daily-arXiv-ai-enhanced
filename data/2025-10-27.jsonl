Accurate estimation of how\nmuch GPU memory a job will require is fundamental to enabling advanced\nscheduling and GPU sharing, which helps prevent out-of-memory (OOM) errors and\nresource underutilization. However, existing estimation methods have\nlimitations. Approaches relying on static analysis or historical data with\nmachine learning often fail to accurately capture runtime dynamics.\nFurthermore, direct GPU analysis consumes scarce resources, and some techniques\nrequire intrusive code modifications. Thus, the key challenge lies in precisely\nestimating dynamic memory requirements, including memory allocator nuances,\nwithout consuming GPU resources and non-intrusive code changes. To address this\nchallenge, we propose xMem, a novel framework that leverages CPU-only dynamic\nanalysis to accurately estimate peak GPU memory requirements a priori. We\nconducted a thorough evaluation of xMem against state-of-the-art solutions\nusing workloads from 25 different models, including architectures like\nConvolutional Neural Networks and Transformers. The analysis of 5209 runs,\nwhich includes ANOVA and Monte Carlo results, highlights xMem's benefits: it\ndecreases the median relative error by 91% and significantly reduces the\nprobability of estimation failure as safe OOM thresholds by 75%, meaning that\nthe estimated value can often be used directly without causing OOM.

First, the\nmajor cloud providers currently put the onus of implementing the mechanisms\nthat ensure compliance with the desired service levels on cloud consumers.\nHowever, consumers do not have the required expertise. Since each cloud\nprovider exports a different set of low-level metrics, the strategies defined\nto ensure compliance with the established service-level agreement (SLA) are\nbound to a particular cloud provider.

However, theoretical understanding lags far behind their\nempirical success. It is widely believed that SGD has a curious ability to\navoid sharp local minima in the loss landscape, which are associated with poor\ngeneralization. To unravel this mystery and further enhance such capability of\nSGDs, it is imperative to go beyond the traditional local convergence analysis\nand obtain a comprehensive understanding of SGDs' global dynamics. In this\npaper, we develop a set of technical machinery based on the recent large\ndeviations and metastability analysis in Wang and Rhee (2023) and obtain sharp\ncharacterization of the global dynamics of heavy-tailed SGDs. In particular, we\nreveal a fascinating phenomenon in deep learning: by injecting and then\ntruncating heavy-tailed noises during the training phase, SGD can almost\ncompletely avoid sharp minima and achieve better generalization performance for\nthe test data. Simulation and deep learning experiments confirm our theoretical\nprediction that heavy-tailed SGD with gradient clipping finds local minima with\na more flat geometry and achieves better generalization performance."}

However, the reliance on normalization-based adaptation presents key\nchallenges. First, normalization layers such as Batch Normalization (BN) are\nhighly sensitive to small batch sizes, leading to unstable and inaccurate\nstatistics. Moreover, normalization-based adaptation is inherently constrained\nby the structure of the pre-trained model, as it relies on training-time\nstatistics that may not generalize well to unseen domains. These issues limit\nthe effectiveness of normalization-based TTA approaches, especially under\nsignificant domain shift. In this paper, we introduce a novel paradigm based on\nthe concept of a Buffer layer, which addresses the fundamental limitations of\nnormalization layer updates. Unlike existing methods that modify the core\nparameters of the model, our approach preserves the integrity of the\npre-trained backbone, inherently mitigating the risk of catastrophic forgetting\nduring online adaptation. Through comprehensive experimentation, we demonstrate\nthat our approach not only outperforms traditional methods in mitigating domain\nshift and enhancing model robustness, but also exhibits strong resilience to\nforgetting. Furthermore, our Buffer layer is modular and can be seamlessly\nintegrated into nearly all existing TTA frameworks, resulting in consistent\nperformance improvements across various architectures. These findings validate\nthe effectiveness and versatility of the proposed solution in real-world domain\nadaptation scenarios. The code is available at\nhttps://github.com/hyeongyu-kim/Buffer_TTA."}

Such divergent approaches\nresult in significant overhead when novel factors of variation do not align\nwith prior assumptions, such as statistical independence or spatial\nexclusivity, or when multiple factors coexist, as practitioners must redesign\narchitectures or objectives. To address this, we propose a compositional bias,\na modular inductive bias decoupled from both objectives and architectures. Our\nkey insight is that different factors obey distinct recombination rules in the\ndata distribution: global attributes are mutually exclusive, e.g., a face has\none nose, while objects share a common support (any subset of objects can\nco-exist). We therefore randomly remix latents according to factor-specific\nrules, i.e., a mixing strategy, and force the encoder to discover whichever\nfactor structure the mixing strategy reflects through two complementary\nobjectives: (i) a prior loss that ensures every remix decodes into a realistic\nimage, and (ii) the compositional consistency loss introduced by Wiedemer et\nal. (arXiv:2310.05327), which aligns each composite image with its\ncorresponding composite latent. Under this general framework, simply adjusting\nthe mixing strategy enables disentanglement of attributes, objects, and even\nboth, without modifying the objectives or architectures. Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate that our method shows competitive performance in both attribute and\nobject disentanglement, and uniquely achieves joint disentanglement of global\nstyle and objects.

ZETA uniquely compares ECG signals\nagainst structured positive and negative clinical observations, which are\ncurated through an LLM-assisted, expert-validated process, thereby mimicking\ndifferential diagnosis. Our approach leverages a pre-trained multimodal model\nto align ECG and text embeddings without disease-specific fine-tuning.\nEmpirical evaluations demonstrate ZETA's competitive zero-shot classification\nperformance and, importantly, provide qualitative and quantitative evidence of\nenhanced interpretability, grounding predictions in specific, clinically\nrelevant positive and negative diagnostic features. ZETA underscores the\npotential of aligning ECG analysis with structured clinical knowledge for\nbuilding more transparent, generalizable, and trustworthy AI diagnostic\nsystems.
