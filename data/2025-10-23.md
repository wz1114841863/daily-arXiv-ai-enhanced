Main category: cs.AR

TL;DR: Res-DPU是一种资源共享的数字内存计算单元，采用5T SRAM锁存器和共享2T AND计算逻辑，显著降低了晶体管数量和功耗，提高了边缘AI加速器的能效和可扩展性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有数字内存计算方法中计算密度低、晶体管数量多、能效差的问题，为边缘AI加速器提供更高效的解决方案。

Method: 提出Res-DPU架构，包括双端口5T SRAM锁存器、共享2T AND计算逻辑、TRAIT加法器树和CIA2M乘法方法，实现资源优化和运行时精度-延迟权衡。

Result: 在TSMC 65nm工艺下，16KB Res-DPIM宏实现0.43 TOPS吞吐量和87.22 TOPS/W能效，ResNet-18/VGG-16在CIFAR-10上达到96.85%质量结果（含30%剪枝）。

Conclusion: Res-DPU为实时边缘AI加速器提供了高度可扩展和节能的解决方案，显著提升了计算密度和能效。

Abstract: Processing-in-memory (PIM) has emerged as the go to solution for addressing
the von Neumann bottleneck in edge AI accelerators. However, state-of-the-art
(SoTA) digital PIM approaches suffer from low compute density, primarily due to
the use of bulky bit cells and transistor-heavy adder trees, which impose
limitations on macro scalability and energy efficiency. This work introduces
Res-DPU, a resource-shared digital PIM unit, with a dual-port 5T SRAM latch and
shared 2T AND compute logic. This reflects the per-bit multiplication cost to
just 5.25T and reduced the transistor count of the PIM array by up to 56% over
the SoTA works. Furthermore, a Transistor-Reduced 2D Interspersed Adder Tree
(TRAIT) with FA-7T and PG-FA-26T helps reduce the power consumption of the
adder tree by up to 21.35% and leads to improved energy efficiency by 59%
compared to conventional 28T RCA designs. We propose a Cycle-controlled
Iterative Approximate-Accurate Multiplication (CIA2M) approach, enabling
run-time accuracy-latency trade-offs without requiring error-correction
circuitry. The 16 KB REP-DPIM macro achieves 0.43 TOPS throughput and 87.22
TOPS/W energy efficiency in TSMC 65nm CMOS, with 96.85% QoR for ResNet-18 or
VGG-16 on CIFAR-10, including 30% pruning. The proposed results establish a
Res-DPU module for highly scalable and energy-efficient real-time edge AI
accelerators.

Main category: cs.AR

TL;DR: 开发了一个基于大语言模型的gem5协同驾驶代理，用于自动化计算机体系结构设计空间探索，通过网页GUI界面、设计空间数据库和检索增强生成系统来提高设计效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 计算机体系结构设计空间探索复杂耗时，需要分析大量参数设置和仿真统计数据，而大语言模型能够加速长文本数据分析和智能决策，这正是成功设计空间探索所需的关键功能。

Method: 构建gem5协同驾驶代理，包括网页GUI界面、自动化代理和结果总结功能；实现设计空间探索语言和设计空间数据库(DSDB)；通过DSDB实现检索增强生成系统。

Result: 在四个成本范围下进行成本约束优化实验，与两个基线模型比较，结果显示gem5协同驾驶代理能够基于性能和成本快速识别特定设计约束的最优参数，且用户交互有限。

Conclusion: gem5协同驾驶代理能够有效加速计算机体系结构设计空间探索过程，在有限用户交互下快速找到满足特定约束的最优设计参数。

Abstract: Generative AI is increasing the productivity of software and hardware
development across many application domains. In this work, we utilize the power
of Large Language Models (LLMs) to develop a co-pilot agent for assisting gem5
users with automating design space exploration. Computer architecture design
space exploration is complex and time-consuming, given that numerous parameter
settings and simulation statistics must be analyzed before improving the
current design. The emergence of LLMs has significantly accelerated the
analysis of long-text data as well as smart decision making, two key functions
in a successful design space exploration task. In this project, we first build
gem5 Co-Pilot, an AI agent assistant for gem5, which comes with a webpage-GUI
for smooth user interaction, agent automation, and result summarization. We
also implemented a language for design space exploration, as well as a Design
Space Database (DSDB). With DSDB, gem5 Co-Pilot effectively implements a
Retrieval Augmented Generation system for gem5 design space exploration. We
experiment on cost-constraint optimization with four cost ranges and compare
our results with two baseline models. Results show that gem5 Co-Pilot can
quickly identify optimal parameters for specific design constraints based on
performance and cost, with limited user interaction.

a new industry that brings with it a global chemosensory infrastructure. We
cover exemplary industrial, military and consumer applications and address some
of the ethical and legal concerns arising. We find that machine olfaction is
poised to bring forth a planet-wide molecular awareness tech layer with the
potential of spawning vast emerging markets in health, security, and
environmental sensing via scent.

### [4] [CodeCRDT: Observation-Driven Coordination for Multi-Agent LLM Code Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18893)
*Sergey Pugachev*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: CodeCRDT提出了一种基于观察驱动的协调模式，使用CRDT技术实现多智能体LLM系统的无锁、无冲突并行代码生成，避免了显式消息传递的开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统多智能体LLM系统由于昂贵的协调成本无法实现并行加速，需要一种更高效的协调机制。

Method: 采用观察驱动协调模式，通过监控共享状态的可观察更新和确定性收敛来协调智能体，使用冲突无关复制数据类型(CRDTs)实现强最终一致性。

Result: 在600次试验中，某些任务加速达21.1%，某些任务减速达39.4%，100%收敛且无合并失败，语义冲突率5-10%。

Conclusion: 该研究形式化了随机LLM智能体的观察驱动协调，揭示了语义冲突率和质量-性能权衡，为基于任务结构的并行协调成功与失败提供了经验特征。

Abstract: Multi-agent LLM systems fail to realize parallel speedups due to costly
coordination. We present CodeCRDT, an observation-driven coordination pattern
where agents coordinate by monitoring a shared state with observable updates
and deterministic convergence, rather than explicit message passing. Using
Conflict-Free Replicated Data Types (CRDTs), CodeCRDT enables lock-free,
conflict-free concurrent code generation with strong eventual consistency.
Evaluation across 600 trials (6 tasks, 50 runs per mode) shows both benefits
and trade-offs: up to 21.1% speedup on some tasks, up to 39.4% slowdown on
others, and 100% convergence with zero merge failures. The study formalizes
observation-driven coordination for stochastic LLM agents, revealing semantic
conflict rates (5-10%) and quality-performance tradeoffs, and provides
empirical characterization of when parallel coordination succeeds versus fails
based on task structure.

### [5] [AI for Distributed Systems Design: Scalable Cloud Optimization Through Repeated LLMs Sampling And Simulators](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18897)
*Jacopo Tagliabue*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: 结合LLM的随机代码生成与确定性验证，通过生成-验证循环设计分布式系统调度策略，在保持可解释性的同时探索大规模设计空间


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索AI驱动的分布式系统策略设计方法，结合大语言模型的生成能力和领域特定模拟器的验证能力

Method: 使用生成-验证循环：LLM生成Python调度策略，模拟器在标准化trace上评估，结构化反馈指导后续生成

Result: 在多个模型上实现了吞吐量提升的初步结果

Conclusion: 当前方法存在局限，AI对于扩展该方法论至关重要，特别是帮助引导新模拟器的开发

Abstract: We explore AI-driven distributed-systems policy design by combining
stochastic code generation from large language models (LLMs) with deterministic
verification in a domain-specific simulator. Using a Function-as-a-Service
runtime (Bauplan) and its open-source simulator (Eudoxia) as a case study, we
frame scheduler design as an iterative generate-and-verify loop: an LLM
proposes a Python policy, the simulator evaluates it on standardized traces,
and structured feedback steers subsequent generations. This setup preserves
interpretability while enabling targeted search over a large design space. We
detail the system architecture and report preliminary results on throughput
improvements across multiple models. Beyond early gains, we discuss the limits
of the current setup and outline next steps; in particular, we conjecture that
AI will be crucial for scaling this methodology by helping to bootstrap new
simulators.

### [6] [Comparative analysis of large data processing in Apache Spark using Java, Python and Scala](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19012)
*Ivan Borodii,Illia Fedorovych,Halyna Osukhivska,Diana Velychko,Roman Butsii*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: 比较了Apache Spark在Java、Python和Scala三种编程语言下处理大数据集的性能差异，发现语言选择对ETL工作流效率有显著影响


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注单个处理阶段，缺乏对完整ETL工作流在不同编程语言下的全面性能比较，特别是结合Apache Iceberg的使用场景

Method: 通过执行从CSV文件下载数据、转换并加载到Apache Iceberg分析表的完整ETL流程，测试三种语言在不同数据量（5MB和1.6GB）和复杂操作下的性能表现

Result: 小文件（5MB）处理Python最快（6.71秒），大文件（1.6GB）三种语言性能相近（Python 46.34秒，Scala 47.72秒，Java 50.56秒），复杂操作（合并两个CSV文件）时Scala最快（374.42秒），Python最慢（398.32秒）

Conclusion: 编程语言显著影响Spark算法效率：Python在处理小数据量时有优势，而Scala和Java在处理大数据量和复杂操作时更高效；选择应基于具体性能需求和数据处理量

Abstract: During the study, the results of a comparative analysis of the process of
handling large datasets using the Apache Spark platform in Java, Python, and
Scala programming languages were obtained. Although prior works have focused on
individual stages, comprehensive comparisons of full ETL workflows across
programming languages using Apache Iceberg remain limited. The analysis was
performed by executing several operations, including downloading data from CSV
files, transforming and loading it into an Apache Iceberg analytical table. It
was found that the performance of the Spark algorithm varies significantly
depending on the amount of data and the programming language used. When
processing a 5-megabyte CSV file, the best result was achieved in Python: 6.71
seconds, which is superior to Scala's score of 9.13 seconds and Java's time of
9.62 seconds. For processing a large CSV file of 1.6 gigabytes, all programming
languages demonstrated similar results: the fastest performance was showed in
Python: 46.34 seconds, while Scala and Java showed results of 47.72 and 50.56
seconds, respectively. When performing a more complex operation that involved
combining two CSV files into a single dataset for further loading into an
Apache Iceberg table, Scala demonstrated the highest performance, at 374.42
seconds. Java processing was completed in 379.8 seconds, while Python was the
least efficient, with a runtime of 398.32 seconds. It follows that the
programming language significantly affects the efficiency of data processing by
the Apache Spark algorithm, with Scala and Java being more productive for
processing large amounts of data and complex operations, while Python
demonstrates an advantage in working with small amounts of data. The results
obtained can be useful for optimizing data handling processes depending on
specific performance requirements and the amount of information being
processed.

### [7] [On the Randomized Locality of Matching Problems in Regular Graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19151)
*Seri Khoury,Manish Purohit,Aaron Schild,Joshua Wang*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: 本文研究了正则图中匹配问题的局部性，证明了(1+ε)-近似匹配的局部性仅依赖于ε，而最大匹配需要依赖节点数n或度数Δ，并建立了节点平均复杂度与最坏情况复杂度之间的强分离。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究分布式对称性破坏问题中的局部性，特别是正则图中匹配问题的局部性特征，这是建立对称性破坏问题局部性下界和分类结果的主要基准。

Method: 开发随机化算法，使用基于鞅的分析方法对Luby已有40年历史的算法进行新分析，证明在Δ-正则图的线图上应用一轮Luby算法会产生几乎Δ/2-正则的图。

Result: 在正则图中，(1+ε)-近似匹配的局部性仅依赖于ε（当Δ≥poly(1/ε)时仅为对数依赖），而最大匹配需要依赖n或Δ；节点平均复杂度仅为O(1)。

Conclusion: 近似匹配在正则图中是真正局部的，与最大匹配形成鲜明对比，且节点平均复杂度和最坏情况复杂度之间存在强分离。

Abstract: The main goal in distributed symmetry-breaking is to understand the locality
of problems; i.e., the radius of the neighborhood that a node needs to explore
in order to arrive at its part of a global solution. In this work, we study the
locality of matching problems in the family of regular graphs, which is one of
the main benchmarks for establishing lower bounds on the locality of
symmetry-breaking problems, as well as for obtaining classification results.
For approximate matching, we develop randomized algorithms to show that $(1 +
\epsilon)$-approximate matching in regular graphs is truly local; i.e., the
locality depends only on $\epsilon$ and is independent of all other graph
parameters. Furthermore, as long as the degree $\Delta$ is not very small
(namely, as long as $\Delta \geq \text{poly}(1/\epsilon)$), this dependence is
only logarithmic in $1/\epsilon$. This stands in sharp contrast to maximal
matching in regular graphs which requires some dependence on the number of
nodes $n$ or the degree $\Delta$. We show matching lower bounds for both
results. For maximal matching, our techniques further allow us to establish a
strong separation between the node-averaged complexity and worst-case
complexity of maximal matching in regular graphs, by showing that the former is
only $O(1)$. Central to our main technical contribution is a novel
martingale-based analysis for the $\approx 40$-year-old algorithm by Luby. In
particular, our analysis shows that applying one round of Luby's algorithm on
the line graph of a $\Delta$-regular graph results in an almost
$\Delta/2$-regular graph.

### [8] [RLBoost: Harvesting Preemptible Resources for Cost-Efficient Reinforcement Learning on LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19225)
*Yongji Wu,Xueshen Liu,Haizhong Zheng,Juncheng Gu,Beidi Chen,Z. Morley Mao,Arvind Krishnamurthy,Ion Stoica*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: RLBoost是一个利用可抢占GPU资源进行高效强化学习训练的系统，通过混合架构和三项关键技术，显著提升训练吞吐量和成本效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RL框架无法有效解决强化学习中rollout和训练阶段资源需求矛盾的问题，同时未能充分利用可抢占GPU资源带来的成本节省机会。

Method: 采用混合架构，包含自适应rollout卸载、基于拉取的权重传输和令牌级响应收集与迁移三项关键技术。

Result: 实验显示RLBoost相比仅使用按需GPU资源，训练吞吐量提升1.51-1.97倍，成本效率提高28%-49%。

Conclusion: RLBoost通过有效利用可抢占GPU资源，成功解决了RL训练中的资源利用效率问题，实现了显著的性能提升和成本节省。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has become essential for unlocking advanced
reasoning capabilities in large language models (LLMs). RL workflows involve
interleaving rollout and training stages with fundamentally different resource
requirements. Rollout typically dominates overall execution time, yet scales
efficiently through multiple independent instances. In contrast, training
requires tightly-coupled GPUs with full-mesh communication. Existing RL
frameworks fall into two categories: co-located and disaggregated
architectures. Co-located ones fail to address this resource tension by forcing
both stages to share the same GPUs. Disaggregated architectures, without
modifications of well-established RL algorithms, suffer from resource
under-utilization. Meanwhile, preemptible GPU resources, i.e., spot instances
on public clouds and spare capacity in production clusters, present significant
cost-saving opportunities for accelerating RL workflows, if efficiently
harvested for rollout.
  In this paper, we present RLBoost, a systematic solution for cost-efficient
RL training that harvests preemptible GPU resources. Our key insight is that
rollout's stateless and embarrassingly parallel nature aligns perfectly with
preemptible and often fragmented resources. To efficiently utilize these
resources despite frequent and unpredictable availability changes, RLBoost
adopts a hybrid architecture with three key techniques: (1) adaptive rollout
offload to dynamically adjust workloads on the reserved (on-demand) cluster,
(2) pull-based weight transfer that quickly provisions newly available
instances, and (3) token-level response collection and migration for efficient
preemption handling and continuous load balancing. Extensive experiments show
RLBoost increases training throughput by 1.51x-1.97x while improving cost
efficiency by 28%-49% compared to using only on-demand GPU resources.

### [9] [RailS: Load Balancing for All-to-All Communication in Distributed Mixture-of-Experts Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19262)
*Heng Xu,Zhiwei Yu,Chengze Du,Ying Zhou,Letian Li,Haojie Wang,Weiqiang Cheng,Jialong Li*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: RailS是一个分布式负载均衡框架，通过利用Rail架构的拓扑对称性，将全局协调转化为本地调度，显著提升MoE训练中的all-to-all通信效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MoE模型训练中的稀疏且高度不平衡的all-to-all通信主导了迭代时间，传统负载均衡方法无法充分利用Rail架构的确定性拓扑，导致多NIC带宽利用率不足。

Method: RailS利用Rail拓扑的对称性证明均匀发送确保均匀接收，每个节点独立执行LPT喷洒调度器进行主动流量平衡，激活N条并行轨道进行细粒度、拓扑感知的多路径传输。

Result: 在合成和真实MoE工作负载中，RailS将总线带宽提升20%-78%，完成时间减少17%-78%。对于Mixtral工作负载，迭代时间缩短18%-40%，实现接近最优的负载平衡。

Conclusion: RailS通过拓扑感知的负载均衡，充分利用分布式训练中的架构并行性，显著提升MoE训练效率。

Abstract: Training Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models introduces sparse and highly
imbalanced all-to-all communication that dominates iteration time. Conventional
load-balancing methods fail to exploit the deterministic topology of Rail
architectures, leaving multi-NIC bandwidth underutilized. We present RailS, a
distributed load-balancing framework that minimizes all-to-all completion time
in MoE training. RailS leverages the Rail topology's symmetry to prove that
uniform sending ensures uniform receiving, transforming global coordination
into local scheduling. Each node independently executes a Longest Processing
Time First (LPT) spraying scheduler to proactively balance traffic using local
information. RailS activates N parallel rails for fine-grained, topology-aware
multipath transmission. Across synthetic and real-world MoE workloads, RailS
improves bus bandwidth by 20%--78% and reduces completion time by 17%--78%. For
Mixtral workloads, it shortens iteration time by 18%--40% and achieves
near-optimal load balance, fully exploiting architectural parallelism in
distributed training.

### [10] [FLASH Viterbi: Fast and Adaptive Viterbi Decoding for Modern Data Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19301)
*Ziheng Deng,Xue Liu,Jiantong Jiang,Yankai Li,Qingxu Deng,Xiaochun Yang*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: 提出了FLASH Viterbi算法，一种快速、轻量级、自适应且硬件友好的Viterbi解码算子，通过非递归分治策略、剪枝和并行化技术提升时间和内存效率，特别适合资源受限的数据系统。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着工作负载迁移到资源受限的边缘平台，标准Viterbi解码仍然内存密集且计算不灵活，现有方法通常在解码时间和空间效率之间权衡，但会产生显著的运行时开销且缺乏适应性。

Method: 结合非递归分治策略与剪枝和并行化技术，提出FLASH-BS Viterbi变体使用动态波束搜索和内存高效数据结构，进一步解耦空间复杂度与隐藏状态空间大小。

Result: 实验表明，所提算法在解码时间和内存效率方面持续优于现有基线，同时保持适应性和硬件友好特性。

Conclusion: FLASH Viterbi算法通过创新的分治策略和硬件优化，为资源受限系统提供了高效、自适应的Viterbi解码解决方案，并开发了FPGA硬件加速器确保实际部署。

Abstract: The Viterbi algorithm is a key operator for structured sequence inference in
modern data systems, with applications in trajectory analysis, online
recommendation, and speech recognition. As these workloads increasingly migrate
to resource-constrained edge platforms, standard Viterbi decoding remains
memory-intensive and computationally inflexible. Existing methods typically
trade decoding time for space efficiency, but often incur significant runtime
overhead and lack adaptability to various system constraints. This paper
presents FLASH Viterbi, a Fast, Lightweight, Adaptive, and Hardware-Friendly
Viterbi decoding operator that enhances adaptability and resource efficiency.
FLASH Viterbi combines a non-recursive divide-and-conquer strategy with pruning
and parallelization techniques to enhance both time and memory efficiency,
making it well-suited for resource-constrained data systems.To further decouple
space complexity from the hidden state space size, we present FLASH-BS Viterbi,
a dynamic beam search variant built on a memory-efficient data structure. Both
proposed algorithms exhibit strong adaptivity to diverse deployment scenarios
by dynamically tuning internal parameters.To ensure practical deployment on
edge devices, we also develop FPGA-based hardware accelerators for both
algorithms, demonstrating high throughput and low resource usage. Extensive
experiments show that our algorithms consistently outperform existing baselines
in both decoding time and memory efficiency, while preserving adaptability and
hardware-friendly characteristics essential for modern data systems. All codes
are publicly available at https://github.com/Dzh-16/FLASH-Viterbi.

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: HybridEP是一个针对受限带宽场景优化的混合专家并行框架，通过动态调整专家空间放置来减少数据传输量和频率，在低带宽环境下相比现有MoE训练系统性能提升最高达5.6倍。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着MoE模型规模快速增长，单数据中心训练已无法满足需求，转向跨数据中心训练。但在跨数据中心场景下，专家并行面临严重的可扩展性问题，主要受限于有限的跨数据中心带宽。现有优化方法在低带宽场景下效果有限。

Method: 提出HybridEP框架，核心思想是动态调整专家空间放置以减少通信开销。构建基于流的模型确定最优传输比例，采用领域划分构建混合模式与GPU级通信拓扑的映射，并通过参数高效迁移进一步优化拓扑结构。

Result: 实验结果显示HybridEP在受限带宽下比现有最优MoE训练系统性能提升最高达5.6倍。在大规模模拟中，HybridEP在1000个数据中心下不同带宽场景中实现最高1.45倍加速。

Conclusion: HybridEP是一个具有更好可扩展性的通用专家并行框架，有效解决了跨数据中心环境下MoE模型训练的带宽瓶颈问题。

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) has become a popular architecture for scaling large
models. However, the rapidly growing scale outpaces model training on a single
DC, driving a shift toward a more flexible, cross-DC training paradigm. Under
this, Expert Parallelism (EP) of MoE faces significant scalability issues due
to the limited cross-DC bandwidth. Specifically, existing EP optimizations
attempt to overlap data communication and computation, which has little benefit
in low-bandwidth scenarios due to a much longer data communication time.
Therefore, the trends of cross-DC EP scaling is fast becoming a critical
roadblock to the continued growth of MoE models.
  To address this, we propose HybridEP, a modeling-guided framework to optimize
EP under constrained bandwidth. Our key idea is to dynamically transform the
spatial placement of experts to reduce data communication traffic and
frequency, thereby minimizing EP's communication overheads. However, it is
non-trivial to find the optimal solution because it complicates the original
communication pattern by mixing data and expert communication. We therefore
build a stream-based model to determine the optimal transmission ratio. Guided
by this, we incorporate two techniques: (1) domain-based partition to construct
the mapping between hybrid patterns and specific communication topology at GPU
level, and (2) parameter-efficient migration to further refine this topology by
reducing expert transmission overhead and enlarging the domain size. Combining
all these designs, HybridEP can be considered as a more general EP with better
scalability. Experimental results show that HybridEP outperforms existing
state-of-the-art MoE training systems by up to 5.6x under constrained
bandwidth. We further compare HybridEP and EP on large-scale simulations.
HybridEP achieves up to 1.45x speedup with 1k DCs under different bandwidths.

TL;DR: Propius是一个用于协作机器学习的可扩展资源管理系统，通过控制平面和数据平面解决多租户资源管理和模型共享的可扩展性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前协作机器学习缺乏可扩展的基础设施，开发者通常为特定用例构建服务端-客户端系统，这不可扩展且不可复用。随着协作机器学习规模增长，需要可扩展、高效且支持多租户的资源管理系统。

Method: Propius系统包含控制平面和数据平面。控制平面支持多协作ML作业间的资源高效共享和多种资源共享策略，数据平面提升协作ML模型共享和结果收集的可扩展性。

Result: 评估显示Propius在资源利用率（最高1.88倍）、吞吐量（最高2.76倍）和作业完成时间（最高1.26倍）方面优于现有资源管理技术和框架。

Conclusion: Propius能够适应客户端机器的异构性，以可扩展方式高效管理和控制ML作业与边缘资源间的计算流，解决了协作机器学习基础设施的可扩展性问题。

Abstract: Collaborative Machine Learning is a paradigm in the field of distributed
machine learning, designed to address the challenges of data privacy,
communication overhead, and model heterogeneity. There have been significant
advancements in optimization and communication algorithm design and ML hardware
that enables fair, efficient and secure collaborative ML training. However,
less emphasis is put on collaborative ML infrastructure development. Developers
and researchers often build server-client systems for a specific collaborative
ML use case, which is not scalable and reusable. As the scale of collaborative
ML grows, the need for a scalable, efficient, and ideally multi-tenant resource
management system becomes more pressing. We propose a novel system, Propius,
that can adapt to the heterogeneity of client machines, and efficiently manage
and control the computation flow between ML jobs and edge resources in a
scalable fashion. Propius is comprised of a control plane and a data plane. The
control plane enables efficient resource sharing among multiple collaborative
ML jobs and supports various resource sharing policies, while the data plane
improves the scalability of collaborative ML model sharing and result
collection. Evaluations show that Propius outperforms existing resource
management techniques and frameworks in terms of resource utilization (up to
$1.88\times$), throughput (up to $2.76$), and job completion time (up to
$1.26\times$).

Motivation: 传统分布式框架如Spark和Flink在大规模批处理或流分析中有效，但在中等规模、延迟敏感的推理场景中引入协调复杂性和审计开销，不符合需求。云提供商提供无服务器GPU和TabNet等可解释表格ML模型，为受监管环境部署提供了新可能。

Method: 设计集成单节点无服务器GPU运行时与TabNet的BDaaS蓝图，利用GPU加速提高吞吐量，无服务器弹性降低成本，特征掩码可解释性满足IL4/FIPS合规要求。

Result: 在HR、Adult和BLS数据集上的基准测试显示，GPU流水线相比Spark基线实现高达4.5倍吞吐量提升、98倍延迟降低和90%每千次推理成本降低，合规机制仅增加约5.7ms延迟且p99<22ms。

Conclusion: 该研究提供了合规感知基准、可复现的Helm打包蓝图和决策框架，证明了在受监管企业和政府环境中安全、可解释且成本高效的无服务器GPU分析的实用性。

Abstract: Industrial and government organizations increasingly depend on data-driven
analytics for workforce, finance, and regulated decision processes, where
timeliness, cost efficiency, and compliance are critical. Distributed
frameworks such as Spark and Flink remain effective for massive-scale batch or
streaming analytics but introduce coordination complexity and auditing
overheads that misalign with moderate-scale, latency-sensitive inference.
Meanwhile, cloud providers now offer serverless GPUs, and models such as TabNet
enable interpretable tabular ML, motivating new deployment blueprints for
regulated environments. In this paper, we present a production-oriented Big
Data as a Service (BDaaS) blueprint that integrates a single-node serverless
GPU runtime with TabNet. The design leverages GPU acceleration for throughput,
serverless elasticity for cost reduction, and feature-mask interpretability for
IL4/FIPS compliance. We conduct benchmarks on the HR, Adult, and BLS datasets,
comparing our approach against Spark and CPU baselines. Our results show that
GPU pipelines achieve up to 4.5x higher throughput, 98x lower latency, and 90%
lower cost per 1K inferences compared to Spark baselines, while compliance
mechanisms add only ~5.7 ms latency with p99 < 22 ms. Interpretability remains
stable under peak load, ensuring reliable auditability. Taken together, these
findings provide a compliance-aware benchmark, a reproducible Helm-packaged
blueprint, and a decision framework that demonstrate the practicality of
secure, interpretable, and cost-efficient serverless GPU analytics for
regulated enterprise and government settings.

### [14] [CommonSense: Efficient Set Intersection (SetX) Protocol Based on Compressed Sensing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19725)
*Jingfan Meng,Tianji Yang,Jun Xu*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的集合交集协议SetX，通过压缩感知技术和多轮通信，显著降低了通信成本，相比传统的集合协调协议SetR，通信开销减少了8-10倍。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的集合交集解决方案通常复用集合协调协议，但存在误解认为两者成本相当。实际上集合交集问题本质上比集合协调更便宜，因此需要专门的优化协议。

Method: 使用多轮通信协议：Alice发送A的压缩感知草图给Bob，Bob识别其独特元素；若A不是B的子集，Bob将无法解码的残差发送回Alice，Alice解码其独特元素。双方通过迭代更新直到达成交集共识。

Result: 在真实数据集上的实验表明，该SetX协议相比基于IBLT的SetR协议，通信成本降低了8-10倍。

Conclusion: 集合交集问题可以通过专门的压缩感知和多轮通信协议实现显著优于集合协调协议的通信效率，打破了传统认知中两者成本相当的误解。

Abstract: In the set reconciliation (\textsf{SetR}) problem, two parties Alice and Bob,
holding sets $\mathsf{A}$ and $\mathsf{B}$, communicate to learn the symmetric
difference $\mathsf{A} \Delta \mathsf{B}$. In this work, we study a related but
under-explored problem: set intersection (\textsf{SetX})~\cite{Ozisik2019},
where both parties learn $\mathsf{A} \cap \mathsf{B}$ instead. However,
existing solutions typically reuse \textsf{SetR} protocols due to the absence
of dedicated \textsf{SetX} protocols and the misconception that \textsf{SetR}
and \textsf{SetX} have comparable costs. Observing that \textsf{SetX} is
fundamentally cheaper than \textsf{SetR}, we developed a multi-round
\textsf{SetX} protocol that outperforms the information-theoretic lower bound
of \textsf{SetR} problem. In our \textsf{SetX} protocol, Alice sends Bob a
compressed sensing (CS) sketch of $\mathsf{A}$ to help Bob identify his unique
elements (those in $\mathsf{B \setminus A}$). This solves the \textsf{SetX}
problem, if $\mathsf{A} \subseteq \mathsf{B}$. Otherwise, Bob sends a CS sketch
of the residue (a set of elements he cannot decode) back to Alice for her to
decode her unique elements (those in $\mathsf{A \setminus B}$). As such, Alice
and Bob communicate back and forth %with a set membership filter (SMF) of
estimated $\mathsf{B \setminus A}$. Alice updates $\mathsf{A}$ and
communication repeats until both parties agrees on $\mathsf{A} \cap
\mathsf{B}$. On real world datasets, experiments show that our $\mathsf{SetX}$
protocol reduces the communication cost by 8 to 10 times compared to the
IBLT-based $\mathsf{SetR}$ protocol.

### [16] [QiMeng-SALV: Signal-Aware Learning for Verilog Code Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19296)
*Yang Zhang,Rui Zhang,Jiaming Guo,Lei Huang,Di Huang,Yunpu Zhao,Shuyao Cheng,Pengwei Jin,Chongxiao Li,Zidong Du,Xing Hu,Qi Guo,Yunji Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出QiMeng-SALV方法，通过利用功能正确输出信号的代码段来优化Verilog代码生成的强化学习训练，实现了从模块级到细粒度信号级优化的范式转变。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在Verilog代码生成方面取得显著进展，但缺乏有意义的功能奖励阻碍了基于强化学习的偏好优化，难以生成功能正确的Verilog代码。

Method: 通过比较生成模块与参考模块的信号功能正确性，使用抽象语法树识别信号感知代码段，引入信号感知DPO在正确信号级代码段上进行优化。

Result: 在VerilogEval和RTLLM上达到最先进性能，7B参数模型匹配DeepSeek v3 671B模型的性能，显著优于在同一数据集上训练的开源模型CodeV。

Conclusion: QiMeng-SALV解决了功能奖励不足的问题，实现了Verilog代码生成从模块级到信号级优化的范式转变，显著提升了生成代码的功能正确性。

Abstract: The remarkable progress of Large Language Models (LLMs) presents promising
opportunities for Verilog code generation which is significantly important for
automated circuit design. The lacking of meaningful functional rewards hinders
the preference optimization based on Reinforcement Learning (RL) for producing
functionally correct Verilog code. In this paper, we propose Signal-Aware
Learning for Verilog code generation (QiMeng-SALV) by leveraging code segments
of functionally correct output signal to optimize RL training. Considering
Verilog code specifies the structural interconnection of hardware gates and
wires so that different output signals are independent, the key insight of
QiMeng-SALV is to extract verified signal-aware implementations in partially
incorrect modules, so as to enhance the extraction of meaningful functional
rewards. Roughly, we verify the functional correctness of signals in generated
module by comparing with that of reference module in the training data. Then
abstract syntax tree (AST) is employed to identify signal-aware code segments
which can provide meaningful functional rewards from erroneous modules.
Finally, we introduce signal-aware DPO which is optimized on the correct
signal-level code segments, thereby preventing noise and interference from
incorrect signals. The proposed QiMeng-SALV underscores the paradigm shift from
conventional module-level to fine-grained signal-level optimization in Verilog
code generation, addressing the issue of insufficient functional rewards.
Experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance
on VerilogEval and RTLLM, with a 7B parameter model matching the performance of
the DeepSeek v3 671B model and significantly outperforming the leading
open-source model CodeV trained on the same dataset. Our code is available at

TL;DR: 提出了一个3D优化框架，联合校准AI推理的准确性、成本和延迟，通过多目标优化实现约束感知的推理扩展。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的1D启发式和2D双变量权衡方法无法同时考虑成本、延迟和准确性约束，需要更全面的优化框架。

Method: 使用蒙特卡洛模拟在三个代表性场景和九个模拟大语言模型上评估四种优化方法，解决3D多目标优化问题。

Result: 膝点优化实现了最佳平衡，当精度优先时准确性最大化方法仍占优势。该框架为不同操作环境下的部署感知推理扩展建立了理论基础。

Conclusion: 3D多目标优化框架能够捕捉1D和2D优化无法覆盖的可行空间，实现环境自适应的推理扩展参数选择。

Abstract: AI inference scaling is often tuned through 1D heuristics (a fixed reasoning
passes) or 2D bivariate trade-offs (e.g., performance vs. compute), which fail
to consider cost and latency constraints. We introduce a 3D optimization
framework that jointly calibrates accuracy, cost, and latency within a unified
decision space, enabling constraints-aware inference scaling. Using Monte Carlo
simulations across three representative scenarios and nine simulated large
language models, we evaluate four optimization methods to address the 3D
multi-objective optimization (MOO) problem. Framing inference scaling in MOO
shapes a feasible space that 1D and 2D optimizations fail to capture, enabling
environmentadaptive selection of the inference scaling k. Results show that
knee-point optimization achieves the best balance, while accuracy-maximization
remains favorable when precision is prioritized. The framework establishes a
theoretical foundation for deployment-aware inference scaling across diverse
operational contexts.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI模型在临床应用中因样本量有限而性能受限，需要可靠的功能神经影像基础模型。自监督学习与脑-结果关系不一定对齐，现有基础模型对下游任务不够优化

Method: 利用丰富的环境变量和人口统计数据，将脑建模构建为多任务学习：1）通过标记多个脑-环境交互进行多任务预训练；2）使用预训练BEI的伪标签进行半监督微调

Result: 在性别预测、人类行为识别以及自闭症、帕金森病、阿尔茨海默病和精神分裂症的早期诊断等多种应用中评估，结果显示有促进当前神经影像临床应用的巨大潜力

Conclusion: 提出的基础模型架构能够有效促进神经影像在临床常规应用中的发展

Abstract: A reliable foundation model of functional neuroimages is critical to promote
clinical applications where the performance of current AI models is
significantly impeded by a limited sample size. To that end, tremendous efforts
have been made to pretraining large models on extensive unlabeled fMRI data
using scalable self-supervised learning. Since self-supervision is not
necessarily aligned with the brain-to-outcome relationship, most foundation
models are suboptimal to the downstream task, such as predicting disease
outcomes. By capitalizing on rich environmental variables and demographic data
along with an unprecedented amount of functional neuroimages, we form the brain
modeling as a multitask learning and present a scalable model architecture for
(i) multitask pretraining by tokenizing multiple brain-environment interactions
(BEI) and (ii) semi-supervised finetuning by assigning pseudo-labels of
pretrained BEI. We have evaluated our foundation model on a variety of
applications, including sex prediction, human behavior recognition, and disease
early diagnosis of Autism, Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, and
{Schizophrenia}, where promising results indicate the great potential to
facilitate current neuroimaging applications in clinical routines.

### [19] [ADPO: Anchored Direct Preference Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18913)
*Wang Zixian*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ADPO是一个统一框架，扩展了DPO，引入软偏好概率、任意参考策略锚定和列表式偏好建模，在噪声环境中显著提升性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准DPO假设硬二元标签和成对比较，存在梯度漂移问题，需要更鲁棒的方法处理不确定性和噪声偏好

Method: 引入软偏好概率编码不确定性，任意参考策略锚定提供训练稳定性，Plackett-Luce分布实现列表式偏好建模

Result: 在上下文赌博机中锚定使WinMass提升38-63%，KDE平滑在重尾噪声下达到0.68 vs 0.32（112%相对增益）；在顺序RL中锚定提升噪声偏好性能15-29%

Conclusion: 推荐在干净或中等噪声下使用成对锚定Soft-DPO，在极端污染下使用基于KDE的列表式ADPO

Abstract: Anchored Direct Preference Optimization (ADPO) is a unified framework that
generalizes Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) with soft preferences,
reference-policy anchoring, and groupwise extensions. While standard DPO
assumes hard binary labels and pairwise comparisons, ADPO introduces: (i) soft
preference probabilities that encode uncertainty and mitigate gradient drift;
(ii) arbitrary reference-policy anchors that stabilize training via groupwise
shift invariance and implicit KL regularization; and (iii) listwise preference
modeling through Plackett-Luce distributions. We prove that DPO, Bradley-Terry
objectives, and Top-1-vs-Rest formulations emerge as special cases. ADPO yields
three practical variants: pairwise anchored Soft-DPO, listwise anchored
Soft-DPO with raw rewards, and KDE-based listwise smoothing for heavy-tailed
noise. In contextual bandits, anchoring improves WinMass by 38-63% over
standard DPO, while KDE smoothing achieves 0.68 vs 0.32 under heavy-tailed
contamination (112% relative gain). In sequential reinforcement learning
(CartPole, LunarLander), anchoring improves noisy-preference performance by
15-29%, confirming transfer from single-step to multi-step settings.
Experiments with 10-256 parameter models provide clear guidance: use pairwise
anchored Soft-DPO for clean or moderate noise, and KDE-based listwise ADPO for
extreme contamination.

Motivation: 随着大语言模型和机器学习的广泛应用，需要能在笔记本电脑和移动电话等小型设备上部署这些模型的框架，MLX框架正是为此而开发。

Method: 创建MLX-transformers框架，包含不同的transformer实现，并将PyTorch模型检查点转换为MLX格式，在苹果硅设备上对BERT、RoBERTa和XLM-RoBERTa模型进行推理延迟基准测试。

Result: 研究结果显示MLX在苹果生态系统内能够实现高效且更易访问的端侧机器学习应用。

Conclusion: MLX框架在苹果硅设备上展现出良好的性能潜力，为端侧机器学习应用提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: The recent widespread adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) and machine
learning in general has sparked research interest in exploring the
possibilities of deploying these models on smaller devices such as laptops and
mobile phones. This creates a need for frameworks and approaches that are
capable of taking advantage of on-device hardware. The MLX framework was
created to address this need. It is a framework optimized for machine learning
(ML) computations on Apple silicon devices, facilitating easier research,
experimentation, and prototyping.
  This paper presents a performance evaluation of MLX, focusing on inference
latency of transformer models. We compare the performance of different
transformer architecture implementations in MLX with their Pytorch
counterparts. For this research we create a framework called MLX-transformers
which includes different transformer implementations in MLX and downloads the
model checkpoints in pytorch and converts it to the MLX format. By leveraging
the advanced architecture and capabilities of Apple Silicon, MLX-Transformers
enables seamless execution of transformer models directly sourced from Hugging
Face, eliminating the need for checkpoint conversion often required when
porting models between frameworks.
  Our study benchmarks different transformer models on two Apple Silicon
macbook devices against an NVIDIA CUDA GPU. Specifically, we compare the
inference latency performance of models with the same parameter sizes and
checkpoints. We evaluate the performance of BERT, RoBERTa, and XLM-RoBERTa
models, with the intention of extending future work to include models of
different modalities, thus providing a more comprehensive assessment of MLX's
capabilities. The results highlight MLX's potential in enabling efficient and
more accessible on-device ML applications within Apple's ecosystem.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RLHF或RLVR等标准对齐方法对不一致或错误奖励的噪声高度敏感，但噪声与广泛使用的基于组的策略优化方法之间的相互作用研究不足。

Method: 引入GRPO和Dr.GRPO框架，将奖励腐败建模为伯努利噪声，在估计奖励翻转概率后应用噪声校正来消除学习信号的偏差，提供可证明无偏的梯度估计。

Result: 在数学和代码任务上观察到一致改进，在数学任务上准确率提升高达6.7个百分点，在代码任务上提升1.5个百分点。

Conclusion: 这项工作将监督学习中的标签噪声校正与现代RLHF连接起来，为噪声现实世界部署提供了理论见解和实用算法。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) or verifiable rewards
(RLVR), the standard paradigm for aligning LLMs or building recent SOTA
reasoning models, is highly sensitive to noise from inconsistent or erroneous
rewards. Yet, the interaction between such noise and widely used group-based
policy optimization methods remains underexplored. We introduce a noise-robust
Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) and Done Right GRPO (Dr.GRPO)
framework that explicitly models reward corruption as Bernoulli noise. Our
method applies noise correction after estimating reward flip probabilities to
debias the learning signal, yielding provably unbiased gradient estimates.
Theoretical analysis shows that group-based methods inherently mitigate
individual-level noise, and our correction strategy amplifies this robustness.
Empirically, we observe consistent improvements across math and code tasks when
applying our noise correction to standard reward model usage, with particular
gains of up to 6.7 percentage points in accuracy on math tasks and 1.5 on code
tasks under realistic reward model conditions. This work bridges label-noise
correction from supervised learning with modern RLHF, offering both theoretical
insights and a practical algorithm for noisy real-world deployment.

Conclusion: 该框架为复杂多尺度系统提供了有效的建模和预测方法，能够在所有时间尺度上提供近似和解释，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Modeling and predicting the dynamics of complex multiscale systems remains a
significant challenge due to their inherent nonlinearities and sensitivity to
initial conditions, as well as limitations of traditional machine learning
methods that fail to capture high frequency behaviours. To overcome these
difficulties, we propose three approaches for multiscale learning. The first
leverages the Partition of Unity (PU) method, integrated with neural networks,
to decompose the dynamics into local components and directly predict both
macro- and micro-scale behaviors. The second applies the Singular Value
Decomposition (SVD) to extract dominant modes that explicitly separate macro-
and micro-scale dynamics. Since full access to the data matrix is rarely
available in practice, we further employ a Sparse High-Order SVD to reconstruct
multiscale dynamics from limited measurements. Together, these approaches
ensure that both coarse and fine dynamics are accurately captured, making the
framework effective for real-world applications involving complex, multi-scale
phenomena and adaptable to higher-dimensional systems with incomplete
observations, by providing an approximation and interpretation in all time
scales present in the phenomena under study.

TL;DR: 提出了BAPO方法，通过动态调整裁剪边界来平衡正负样本贡献，解决离策略强化学习中策略熵下降和优化不稳定的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 离策略强化学习虽然提高了样本效率，但存在策略熵急剧下降、优化不稳定甚至崩溃的问题，需要解决负优势样本主导和固定裁剪机制抑制探索的问题。

Method: 提出BAPO方法，基于熵裁剪规则，动态调整裁剪边界来平衡正负样本贡献，保持策略熵并稳定优化过程。

Result: 在AIME 2024和2025基准测试中，7B BAPO模型超越开源对手SkyWork-OR1-7B，32B BAPO模型在同规模模型中达到SOTA，甚至优于o3-mini和Gemini-2.5-Flash-Thinking等专有系统。

Conclusion: BAPO方法通过自适应裁剪机制有效解决了离策略强化学习的稳定性问题，实现了快速、稳定且数据高效的训练。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has recently become the core paradigm for
aligning and strengthening large language models (LLMs). Yet, applying RL in
off-policy settings--where stale data from past policies are used for
training--improves sample efficiency, but remains challenging: policy entropy
declines sharply, optimization often becomes unstable and may even collapse.
Through theoretical and empirical analysis, we identify two key insights: (i)
an imbalance in optimization, where negative-advantage samples dominate the
policy gradient, suppressing useful behaviors and risking gradient explosions;
and (ii) the derived Entropy-Clip Rule, which reveals that the fixed clipping
mechanism in PPO-like objectives systematically blocks entropy-increasing
updates, thereby driving the policy toward over-exploitation at the expense of
exploration. Building on these insights, we propose BAlanced Policy
Optimization with Adaptive Clipping (BAPO), a simple yet effective method that
dynamically adjusts clipping bounds to adaptively re-balance positive and
negative contributions, preserve entropy, and stabilize RL optimization. Across
diverse off-policy scenarios--including sample replay and partial rollout--BAPO
achieves fast, stable, and data-efficient training. On AIME 2024 and AIME 2025
benchmarks, our 7B BAPO model surpasses open-source counterparts such as
SkyWork-OR1-7B, while our 32B BAPO model not only achieves state-of-the-art
results among models of the same scale but also outperforms leading proprietary
systems like o3-mini and Gemini-2.5-Flash-Thinking.

### [24] [Position: Many generalization measures for deep learning are fragile](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18934)
*Shuofeng Zhang,Ard Louis*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文指出许多深度神经网络的事后泛化度量是脆弱的：微小的训练修改可能显著改变度量的值、趋势或缩放行为，即使这些修改几乎不影响DNN本身。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然深度神经网络的泛化度量难以获得紧致边界，但通常被认为能重现定性泛化趋势。本文旨在揭示这些事后泛化度量的脆弱性。

Method: 通过实验分析不同训练修改（如超参数调整、优化器变体）对多种泛化度量的影响，包括路径范数、谱范数、Frobenius范数、平坦度代理和确定性PAC-Bayes替代度量。

Result: 发现许多泛化度量对微小训练修改高度敏感，例如学习率调整或SGD变体切换可以反转学习曲线的斜率。PAC-Bayes原点度量虽然对超参数调整较不敏感，但无法捕捉数据复杂度的差异。

Conclusion: 许多泛化度量存在脆弱性问题，新度量开发者应明确审计其脆弱性。函数基边际似然PAC-Bayes边界能捕捉数据复杂度差异，但不是事后度量。

Abstract: A wide variety of generalization measures have been applied to deep neural
networks (DNNs). Although obtaining tight bounds remains challenging, such
measures are often assumed to reproduce qualitative generalization trends. In
this position paper, we argue that many post-mortem generalization measures --
those computed on trained networks -- are \textbf{fragile}: small training
modifications that barely affect the underlying DNN can substantially change a
measure's value, trend, or scaling behavior. For example, minor hyperparameter
changes, such as learning rate adjustments or switching between SGD variants
can reverse the slope of a learning curve in widely used generalization
measures like the path norm. We also identify subtler forms of fragility. For
instance, the PAC-Bayes origin measure is regarded as one of the most reliable,
and is indeed less sensitive to hyperparameter tweaks than many other measures.
However, it completely fails to capture differences in data complexity across
learning curves. This data fragility contrasts with the function-based
marginal-likelihood PAC-Bayes bound, which does capture differences in
data-complexity, including scaling behavior, in learning curves, but which is
not a post-mortem measure. Beyond demonstrating that many bounds -- such as
path, spectral and Frobenius norms, flatness proxies, and deterministic
PAC-Bayes surrogates -- are fragile, this position paper also argues that
developers of new measures should explicitly audit them for fragility.

TL;DR: NeuroAda是一种新颖的参数高效微调方法，通过识别重要参数并为其添加旁路连接，在保持高内存效率的同时实现细粒度模型微调。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有参数高效微调方法存在权衡：基于添加的方法（如LoRA）内存效率高但表示能力有限，而选择性原位适应方法适应效果好但内存消耗大。NeuroAda旨在调和这一权衡。

Method: 首先识别网络中的重要参数（连接），然后为这些选定的参数引入旁路连接。在微调过程中，只更新旁路连接，原始模型参数保持冻结。

Result: 在23+个自然语言生成和理解任务上的实验表明，NeuroAda仅需≤0.02%的可训练参数就能达到最先进性能，同时将CUDA内存使用量减少高达60%。

Conclusion: NeuroAda在保持高内存效率的同时实现了细粒度模型微调，为参数高效微调提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Existing parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods primarily fall into
two categories: addition-based and selective in-situ adaptation. The former,
such as LoRA, introduce additional modules to adapt the model to downstream
tasks, offering strong memory efficiency. However, their representational
capacity is often limited, making them less suitable for fine-grained
adaptation. In contrast, the latter directly fine-tunes a carefully chosen
subset of the original model parameters, allowing for more precise and
effective adaptation, but at the cost of significantly increased memory
consumption. To reconcile this trade-off, we propose NeuroAda, a novel PEFT
method that enables fine-grained model finetuning while maintaining high memory
efficiency. Our approach first identifies important parameters (i.e.,
connections within the network) as in selective adaptation, and then introduces
bypass connections for these selected parameters. During finetuning, only the
bypass connections are updated, leaving the original model parameters frozen.

*Yifei Sun*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出对抗性师生蒸馏框架，使用可微分数值求解器监督紧凑神经算子，通过PGD风格主动采样寻找最坏情况输入，提升神经算子的分布外泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Method: 使用可微分谱求解器进行梯度对抗搜索，通过PGD风格主动采样在平滑性和能量约束下寻找最坏情况输入来扩展训练集，实现对抗蒸馏。

Result: 在Burgers和Navier-Stokes系统上的实验表明，对抗蒸馏显著提高了分布外鲁棒性，同时保持了神经算子的低参数成本和快速推理优势。

Conclusion: 对抗蒸馏框架有效解决了神经算子的分布外泛化问题，在保持计算效率的同时显著提升了鲁棒性。

Abstract: Nonlinear PDE solvers require fine space-time discretizations and local
linearizations, leading to high memory cost and slow runtimes. Neural operators
such as FNOs and DeepONets offer fast single-shot inference by learning
function-to-function mappings and truncating high-frequency components, but
they suffer from poor out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization, often failing
on inputs outside the training distribution. We propose an adversarial
teacher-student distillation framework in which a differentiable numerical
solver supervises a compact neural operator while a PGD-style active sampling
loop searches for worst-case inputs under smoothness and energy constraints to
expand the training set. Using differentiable spectral solvers enables
gradient-based adversarial search and stabilizes sample mining. Experiments on
Burgers and Navier-Stokes systems demonstrate that adversarial distillation
substantially improves OOD robustness while preserving the low parameter cost
and fast inference of neural operators.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的编码-分解范式，通过将编码表示分解为稳定和辅助表示来增强在污染时间序列训练时的鲁棒性，并使用基于互信息的新指标替代重构误差进行异常检测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自编码器在时间序列异常检测中广泛应用，但其学习到的表示对训练时间序列中的异常敏感，导致准确性降低。需要一种更鲁棒的方法来处理训练数据可能被污染的情况。

Method: 采用编码-分解范式，将编码表示分解为稳定表示和辅助表示；提出基于互信息的新指标来识别异常，替代传统的重构误差方法。

Result: 在8个常用的多变量和单变量时间序列基准测试中表现出竞争性或最先进的性能，对不同污染比例的时间序列展现出鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 提出的编码-分解范式和基于互信息的异常检测方法能够有效提升在污染训练数据下的异常检测性能，具有很好的鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Time series anomaly detection is important in modern large-scale systems and
is applied in a variety of domains to analyze and monitor the operation of
diverse systems. Unsupervised approaches have received widespread interest, as
they do not require anomaly labels during training, thus avoiding potentially
high costs and having wider applications. Among these, autoencoders have
received extensive attention. They use reconstruction errors from compressed
representations to define anomaly scores. However, representations learned by
autoencoders are sensitive to anomalies in training time series, causing
reduced accuracy. We propose a novel encode-then-decompose paradigm, where we
decompose the encoded representation into stable and auxiliary representations,
thereby enhancing the robustness when training with contaminated time series.
In addition, we propose a novel mutual information based metric to replace the
reconstruction errors for identifying anomalies. Our proposal demonstrates
competitive or state-of-the-art performance on eight commonly used multi- and
univariate time series benchmarks and exhibits robustness to time series with
different contamination ratios.

Motivation: 当前医疗实践依赖标准化治疗框架，忽视患者个体差异，导致次优健康结果。

Method: 使用LLM处理非结构化医疗文本为结构化数据，CTGAN生成合成患者数据，T-learner预测个体治疗反应，上下文bandit优化治疗选择。

Result: LLM处理准确率93.2%，CTGAN生成数据55%准确率，T-learner预测84.3%准确率，KernelUCB在5000轮中获得0.60-0.61平均奖励分数。

Conclusion: 该系统克服了在线学习环境的冷启动限制，提高了计算效率，在个性化医疗方面取得了显著进展。

Abstract: Current medical practice depends on standardized treatment frameworks and
empirical methodologies that neglect individual patient variations, leading to
suboptimal health outcomes. We develop a comprehensive system integrating Large
Language Models (LLMs), Conditional Tabular Generative Adversarial Networks
(CTGAN), T-learner counterfactual models, and contextual bandit approaches to
provide customized, data-informed clinical recommendations. The approach
utilizes LLMs to process unstructured medical narratives into structured
datasets (93.2% accuracy), uses CTGANs to produce realistic synthetic patient
data (55% accuracy via two-sample verification), deploys T-learners to forecast
patient-specific treatment responses (84.3% accuracy), and integrates
prior-informed contextual bandits to enhance online therapeutic selection by
effectively balancing exploration of new possibilities with exploitation of
existing knowledge. Testing on stage III colon cancer datasets revealed that
our KernelUCB approach obtained 0.60-0.61 average reward scores across 5,000
rounds, exceeding other reference methods. This comprehensive system overcomes
cold-start limitations in online learning environments, improves computational
effectiveness, and constitutes notable progress toward individualized medicine
adapted to specific patient characteristics.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种理论框架，解释人工神经网络中类别学习的机制。研究表明，最小化贝叶斯成本（交叉熵损失均值）意味着最大化类别与决策层前神经活动之间的互信息。在低维特征空间的结构化数据中，这会导致在类别边界附近扩展神经空间表示。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是解释动物和人工神经网络中观察到的类别感知现象，即类别学习会增强类别边界附近刺激的区分能力。作者希望将之前基于神经科学数据的建模工作扩展到人工网络，建立统一的理论框架。

Method: 方法包括：1）建立理论框架，将最小化贝叶斯成本与最大化互信息联系起来；2）分析结构化数据在低维特征空间中的表示学习；3）引入Fisher信息矩阵来衡量神经活动对投影空间变化的敏感性；4）通过玩具模型和MNIST数据集进行数值验证。

Result: 研究发现：1）最优学习使神经Fisher信息遵循类别特定的Fisher信息；2）类别学习在决策边界附近诱导神经空间扩展；3）Fisher信息矩阵的特征向量给出了投影空间各点最具区分性的方向；4）Fisher信息的最大值通常不在类别边界上，而是在其附近。

Conclusion: 结论是类别学习通过最大化互信息来优化神经表示，导致在类别边界附近形成扩展的神经空间表示。该框架与信息瓶颈方法相关，并展示了贝叶斯成本的偏差-方差分解，为理解人工神经网络中的类别学习提供了理论基础。

Abstract: In animals, category learning enhances discrimination between stimuli close
to the category boundary. This phenomenon, called categorical perception, was
also empirically observed in artificial neural networks trained on
classification tasks. In previous modeling works based on neuroscience data, we
show that this expansion/compression is a necessary outcome of efficient
learning. Here we extend our theoretical framework to artificial networks. We
show that minimizing the Bayes cost (mean of the cross-entropy loss) implies
maximizing the mutual information between the set of categories and the neural
activities prior to the decision layer. Considering structured data with an
underlying feature space of small dimension, we show that maximizing the mutual
information implies (i) finding an appropriate projection space, and, (ii)
building a neural representation with the appropriate metric. The latter is
based on a Fisher information matrix measuring the sensitivity of the neural
activity to changes in the projection space. Optimal learning makes this neural
Fisher information follow a category-specific Fisher information, measuring the
sensitivity of the category membership. Category learning thus induces an
expansion of neural space near decision boundaries. We characterize the
properties of the categorical Fisher information, showing that its eigenvectors
give the most discriminant directions at each point of the projection space. We
find that, unexpectedly, its maxima are in general not exactly at, but near,
the class boundaries. Considering toy models and the MNIST dataset, we
numerically illustrate how after learning the two Fisher information matrices
match, and essentially align with the category boundaries. Finally, we relate
our approach to the Information Bottleneck one, and we exhibit a bias-variance
decomposition of the Bayes cost, of interest on its own.

### [30] [Empowering Decision Trees via Shape Function Branching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19040)
*Nakul Upadhya,Eldan Cohen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种新型决策树——形状广义树(SGT)，通过在每个内部节点应用可学习的轴对齐形状函数，实现非线性分割，在保持可解释性的同时提升性能并减小模型规模。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统决策树依赖简单的轴对齐线性分割，需要深度复杂的结构来捕捉非线性特征效应，这削弱了模型的可解释性。

Method: 提出SGT框架，每个内部节点对单个特征应用可学习的轴对齐形状函数；开发ShapeCART算法来学习SGT；扩展到双变量形状函数(S²GT)和多路树(SGT_K)。

Result: 在多个数据集上的实验表明，SGT相比传统轴对齐线性树实现了更优的性能和更小的模型规模。

Conclusion: SGT通过引入可学习的形状函数，在保持决策树可解释性的同时，显著提升了模型性能并减小了模型复杂度。

Abstract: Decision trees are prized for their interpretability and strong performance
on tabular data. Yet, their reliance on simple axis-aligned linear splits often
forces deep, complex structures to capture non-linear feature effects,
undermining human comprehension of the constructed tree. To address this
limitation, we propose a novel generalization of a decision tree, the Shape
Generalized Tree (SGT), in which each internal node applies a learnable
axis-aligned shape function to a single feature, enabling rich, non-linear
partitioning in one split. As users can easily visualize each node's shape
function, SGTs are inherently interpretable and provide intuitive, visual
explanations of the model's decision mechanisms. To learn SGTs from data, we
propose ShapeCART, an efficient induction algorithm for SGTs. We further extend
the SGT framework to bivariate shape functions (S$^2$GT) and multi-way trees
(SGT$_K$), and present Shape$^2$CART and ShapeCART$_K$, extensions to ShapeCART
for learning S$^2$GTs and SGT$_K$s, respectively. Experiments on various
datasets show that SGTs achieve superior performance with reduced model size
compared to traditional axis-aligned linear trees.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: POLAR是首个使用强化学习解决联邦学习中后门关键层选择问题的框架，通过伯努利采样动态学习攻击策略，在保持隐蔽性的同时显著提升攻击成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦学习的分布式特性使其易受后门攻击，现有基于规则的后门关键层选择方法未考虑层间相互关系，效果有限且易被先进防御检测。

Method: 采用基于策略的层间强化学习，通过伯努利采样实现轻量级设计，使用策略梯度更新基于后门成功率优化层选择，并引入正则化约束限制修改层数以保持隐蔽性。

Result: 在对抗六种最先进防御方法的实验中，POLAR比最新攻击方法性能提升高达40%。

Conclusion: POLAR证明了强化学习在后门关键层选择中的有效性，为联邦学习安全研究提供了新思路。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables decentralized model training across multiple
clients without exposing local data, but its distributed feature makes it
vulnerable to backdoor attacks. Despite early FL backdoor attacks modifying
entire models, recent studies have explored the concept of backdoor-critical
(BC) layers, which poison the chosen influential layers to maintain
stealthiness while achieving high effectiveness. However, existing BC layers
approaches rely on rule-based selection without consideration of the
interrelations between layers, making them ineffective and prone to detection
by advanced defenses. In this paper, we propose POLAR (POlicy-based LAyerwise
Reinforcement learning), the first pipeline to creatively adopt RL to solve the
BC layer selection problem in layer-wise backdoor attack. Different from other
commonly used RL paradigm, POLAR is lightweight with Bernoulli sampling. POLAR
dynamically learns an attack strategy, optimizing layer selection using policy
gradient updates based on backdoor success rate (BSR) improvements. To ensure
stealthiness, we introduce a regularization constraint that limits the number
of modified layers by penalizing large attack footprints. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that POLAR outperforms the latest attack methods by up to 40%
against six state-of-the-art (SOTA) defenses.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 研究发现Maximal Update Parameterization (muP)的学习率缩放规则仅在训练初期有效，而在实际LLM训练中，权重衰减才是稳定内部表示更新动态的关键因素，muP主要起到隐式学习率预热的作用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在理解如何将小神经网络的最优学习率有效转移到大型网络中，以解决在大规模模型训练中超参数调优成本过高的问题。

Method: 通过大规模实证研究，分析muP学习率缩放规则在实际训练中的有效性，特别关注权重衰减在稳定内部表示更新动态中的作用。

Result: 发现muP的假设仅在训练初期成立，而在大部分训练过程中，权重衰减才是实现学习率转移的关键机制。

Conclusion: muP主要作为隐式学习率预热机制，可以通过修改预热计划来替代，这挑战了当前关于学习率转移的普遍认知。

Abstract: Transferring the optimal learning rate from small to large neural networks
can enable efficient training at scales where hyperparameter tuning is
otherwise prohibitively expensive. To this end, the Maximal Update
Parameterization (muP) proposes a learning rate scaling designed to keep the
update dynamics of internal representations stable across different model
widths. However, the scaling rules of muP rely on strong assumptions,
particularly about the geometric alignment of a layer's inputs with both its
weights and gradient updates. In this large-scale empirical investigation, we
show that these assumptions hold only briefly at the start of training in the
practical setups where learning rate transfer is most valuable, such as LLM
training. For the remainder of training it is weight decay rather than muP that
correctly stabilizes the update dynamics of internal representations across
widths, facilitating learning rate transfer. This suggests muP's scaling
primarily acts as a form of implicit learning rate warmup, allowing us to
largely replace it with modified warmup schedules. Together these findings
fundamentally challenge prevailing beliefs about learning rate transfer and can
explain empirical practice such as why muP requires the independent weight
decay variant for successful transfer.

TL;DR: 本研究通过统一的离线评估框架，分解课程难度为五个维度，发现课程学习的效果取决于模型能力和任务复杂性，没有统一的策略。任务对齐课程关注最终表示和泛化，而内部状态课程调节置信度和不确定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决课程学习中存在的核心问题：何时课程学习有效？正向还是反向课程更好？答案是否取决于评估指标？通过统一框架比较不同难度指标和训练设置。

Method: 使用统一的离线评估框架，将课程难度分解为五个维度：问题难度、模型惊奇度、置信度边际、预测不确定性和决策变异性。在数学推理基准上对Llama3.1-8B、Mistral-7B和Gemma3-4B进行受控后训练实验。

Result: 发现：(i) 没有通用的课程策略 - 正向与反向课程学习的相对有效性取决于模型能力和任务复杂性；(ii) 即使在单一指标内，不同难度级别的样本根据任务需求产生不同的收益；(iii) 任务对齐课程关注最终表示和泛化，而内部状态课程调节内部状态如置信度和不确定性。

Conclusion: 研究结果挑战了通用课程策略的概念，为不同模型和任务领域提供可操作的指导，某些指标显示优先处理决策不确定样本可以进一步改善学习效果。

Abstract: Curriculum learning (CL) - ordering training data from easy to hard - has
become a popular strategy for improving reasoning in large language models
(LLMs). Yet prior work employs disparate difficulty metrics and training
setups, leaving open fundamental questions: When does curriculum help? Which
direction - forward or reverse - is better? And does the answer depend on what
we measure? We address these questions through a unified offline evaluation
framework that decomposes curriculum difficulty into five complementary
dimensions: Problem Difficulty, Model Surprisal, Confidence Margin, Predictive
Uncertainty, and Decision Variability. Through controlled post-training
experiments on mathematical reasoning benchmarks with Llama3.1-8B, Mistral-7B,
and Gemma3-4B, we find that (i) no curriculum strategy dominates universally -
the relative effectiveness of forward versus reverse CL depends jointly on
model capability and task complexity; (ii) even within a single metric, samples
at different difficulty levels produce distinct gains depending on task
demands; and (iii) task-aligned curricula focus on shaping the model's final
representations and generalization, whereas inner-state curricula modulate
internal states such as confidence and uncertainty. Our findings challenge the
notion of a universal curriculum strategy and offer actionable guidance across
model and task regimes, with some metrics indicating that prioritizing
decision-uncertain samples can further enhance learning outcomes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: KANs用每边系数向量替代标量权重提高了表达能力，但导致参数和内存呈倍数增长，需要高效的压缩方法。

Method: 联合训练轻量级元学习器将低维嵌入映射到系数向量，在系数空间进行K-means聚类，用共享质心替换每边向量，然后微调质心码本。

Result: 在MNIST、CIFAR-10和CIFAR-100数据集上，对标准KANs和ConvKANs实现高达80倍的参数存储减少，且无精度损失。

Conclusion: MetaCluster成功解决了KANs参数存储效率低的问题，通过系数向量聚类实现了高效的模型压缩。

Abstract: Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) replace scalar weights with per-edge
vectors of basis coefficients, thereby boosting expressivity and accuracy but
at the same time resulting in a multiplicative increase in parameters and
memory. We propose MetaCluster, a framework that makes KANs highly compressible
without sacrificing accuracy. Specifically, a lightweight meta-learner, trained
jointly with the KAN, is used to map low-dimensional embedding to coefficient
vectors, shaping them to lie on a low-dimensional manifold that is amenable to
clustering. We then run K-means in coefficient space and replace per-edge
vectors with shared centroids. Afterwards, the meta-learner can be discarded,
and a brief fine-tuning of the centroid codebook recovers any residual accuracy
loss. The resulting model stores only a small codebook and per-edge indices,
exploiting the vector nature of KAN parameters to amortize storage across
multiple coefficients. On MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100, across standard KANs
and ConvKANs using multiple basis functions, MetaCluster achieves a reduction
of up to 80$\times$ in parameter storage, with no loss in accuracy. Code will
be released upon publication.

Conclusion: 同伴影响力概率学习存在基本权衡，提出的算法能够灵活控制探索与利用的平衡，在估计精度和性能优化之间取得良好效果。

Abstract: In networked environments, users frequently share recommendations about
content, products, services, and courses of action with others. The extent to
which such recommendations are successful and adopted is highly contextual,
dependent on the characteristics of the sender, recipient, their relationship,
the recommended item, and the medium, which makes peer influence probabilities
highly heterogeneous. Accurate estimation of these probabilities is key to
understanding information diffusion processes and to improving the
effectiveness of viral marketing strategies. However, learning these
probabilities from data is challenging; static data may capture correlations
between peer recommendations and peer actions but fails to reveal influence
relationships. Online learning algorithms can learn these probabilities from
interventions but either waste resources by learning from random exploration or
optimize for rewards, thus favoring exploration of the space with higher
influence probabilities. In this work, we study learning peer influence
probabilities under a contextual linear bandit framework. We show that a
fundamental trade-off can arise between regret minimization and estimation
error, characterize all achievable rate pairs, and propose an
uncertainty-guided exploration algorithm that, by tuning a parameter, attains
any pair within this trade-off. Our experiments on semi-synthetic network
datasets show the advantages of our method over static methods and contextual
bandits that ignore this trade-off.

Motivation: 现有可控音乐生成方法通常需要重新训练模型或会产生可听伪影，因此需要一种能够在不影响生成质量的前提下实现精细控制的方法。

Method: 训练轻量级RFM探针来发现MusicGen隐藏状态中的概念方向，然后在推理过程中将这些方向注入回模型，通过动态时间变化调度和多属性同时执行机制实现实时控制。

Result: 将目标音符生成的准确率从0.23提高到0.82，同时文本提示的遵循度保持在未引导基线的约0.02范围内，在控制效果和生成质量之间取得了良好平衡。

Conclusion: MusicRFM框架成功展示了在保持预训练模型质量的同时实现细粒度音乐控制的能力，为音乐领域的RFM应用开辟了新方向。

Abstract: Controllable music generation remains a significant challenge, with existing
methods often requiring model retraining or introducing audible artifacts. We
introduce MusicRFM, a framework that adapts Recursive Feature Machines (RFMs)
to enable fine-grained, interpretable control over frozen, pre-trained music
models by directly steering their internal activations. RFMs analyze a model's
internal gradients to produce interpretable "concept directions", or specific
axes in the activation space that correspond to musical attributes like notes
or chords. We first train lightweight RFM probes to discover these directions
within MusicGen's hidden states; then, during inference, we inject them back
into the model to guide the generation process in real-time without per-step
optimization. We present advanced mechanisms for this control, including
dynamic, time-varying schedules and methods for the simultaneous enforcement of
multiple musical properties. Our method successfully navigates the trade-off
between control and generation quality: we can increase the accuracy of
generating a target musical note from 0.23 to 0.82, while text prompt adherence
remains within approximately 0.02 of the unsteered baseline, demonstrating
effective control with minimal impact on prompt fidelity. We release code to
encourage further exploration on RFMs in the music domain.

Motivation: 传统Granger因果性测试基于线性模型，难以检测非线性因果关系。现有方法依赖因果充分性和已知干预目标两个关键假设，但实际中常存在潜在混杂因素，且时间序列数据通常来自异质环境，缺乏干预的先验知识。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上的广泛实验表明，该方法相比最先进方法具有竞争性性能。

Conclusion: 建立了在这些条件下的可识别性，证明了InvarGC在存在潜在混杂因素和未知干预环境下的有效性。

Abstract: Granger causality is widely used for causal structure discovery in complex
systems from multivariate time series data. Traditional Granger causality tests
based on linear models often fail to detect even mild non-linear causal
relationships. Therefore, numerous recent studies have investigated non-linear
Granger causality methods, achieving improved performance. However, these
methods often rely on two key assumptions: causal sufficiency and known
interventional targets. Causal sufficiency assumes the absence of latent
confounders, yet their presence can introduce spurious correlations. Moreover,
real-world time series data usually come from heterogeneous environments,
without prior knowledge of interventions. Therefore, in practice, it is
difficult to distinguish intervened environments from non-intervened ones, and
even harder to identify which variables or timesteps are affected. To address
these challenges, we propose Invariant Granger Causality (InvarGC), which
leverages cross-environment heterogeneity to mitigate the effects of latent
confounding and to distinguish intervened from non-intervened environments with
edge-level granularity, thereby recovering invariant causal relations. In
addition, we establish the identifiability under these conditions. Extensive
experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the
competitive performance of our approach compared to state-of-the-art methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着机器学习模型越来越多地在合成数据上进行微调，存在微妙错位通过互连AI系统传播的关键风险，需要量化理解潜隐污染的动力学机制。

Method: 使用GPT-2构建师生设置，系统研究潜隐污染的缩放规律、阈值和机制，包括行为交叉、相变分析和可解释性分析。

Result: 发现三个关键结果：行为交叉导致整体对齐性退化；对齐性在污染数据临界阈值处发生急剧相变而非渐进退化；污染机制模仿自然微调过程难以检测。

Conclusion: 结果表明依赖合成数据的AI系统存在关键脆弱性，需要能够考虑潜在威胁的新安全协议。

Abstract: As machine learning models are increasingly fine-tuned on synthetic data,
there is a critical risk of subtle misalignments spreading through
interconnected AI systems. This paper investigates subliminal corruption, which
we define as undesirable traits are transmitted through semantically neutral
data, bypassing standard safety checks. While this phenomenon has been
identified, a quantitative understanding of its dynamics is missing. To address
this gap, we present a systematic study of the scaling laws, thresholds, and
mechanisms of subliminal corruption using a teacher-student setup with GPT-2.
Our experiments reveal three key findings: (1) subliminal corruption causes
behavioral crossover, degrading the model's overall alignment, not just the
targeted trait; (2) alignment fails in a sharp phase transition at a critical
threshold of poisoned data, rather than degrading gradually; and (3)
interpretability analysis shows the corruption mechanism mimics the model's
natural fine-tuning process, making it difficult to detect. These results
demonstrate a critical vulnerability in AI systems that rely on synthetic data
and highlight the need for new safety protocols that can account for latent
threats.

Conclusion: 特征空间微调能有效缓解灾难性遗忘，保持预训练知识，提升模型在分布偏移下的泛化能力。

Abstract: Catastrophic forgetting is a common issue in model fine-tuning, especially
when the downstream domain contains limited labeled data or differs greatly
from the pre-training distribution. Existing parameter-efficient fine-tuning
methods operate in the weight space by modifying or augmenting the pre-trained
model's parameters, which can yield models overly specialized to the available
downstream data. To mitigate the risk of overwriting pre-trained knowledge and
enhance robustness, we propose to fine-tune the pre-trained model in the
feature space. Two new fine-tuning methods are proposed: LoRFA (Low-Rank
Feature Adaptation) and VeFA (Vector-Based Feature Adaptation). Feature space
adaptation is inspired by the idea of effect equivalence modeling (EEM) of
downstream lurking variables causing distribution shifts, which posits that
unobserved factors can be represented as the total equivalent amount on
observed features. By compensating for the effects of downstream lurking
variables via a lightweight feature-level transformation, the pre-trained
representations can be preserved, which improves model generalization under
distribution shift. We evaluate LoRFA and VeFA versus LoRA on image
classification, NLU, and NLG, covering both standard fine-tuning metrics and
robustness. Feature space adaptation achieves comparable fine-tuning results
and consistently stronger robustness.

Conclusion: 该模型涵盖了新旧部分信息设置，在某些有趣情况下对游戏结构的依赖可能是紧的。

Abstract: In contrast to the classic formulation of partial monitoring, linear partial
monitoring can model infinite outcome spaces, while imposing a linear structure
on both the losses and the observations. This setting can be viewed as a
generalization of linear bandits where loss and feedback are decoupled in a
flexible manner. In this work, we address a nonstochastic (adversarial),
finite-actions version of the problem through a simple instance of the
exploration-by-optimization method that is amenable to efficient
implementation. We derive regret bounds that depend on the game structure in a
more transparent manner than previous theoretical guarantees for this paradigm.
Our bounds feature instance-specific quantities that reflect the degree of
alignment between observations and losses, and resemble known guarantees in the
stochastic setting. Notably, they achieve the standard $\sqrt{T}$ rate in easy
(locally observable) games and $T^{2/3}$ in hard (globally observable) games,
where $T$ is the time horizon. We instantiate these bounds in a selection of
old and new partial information settings subsumed by this model, and illustrate
that the achieved dependence on the game structure can be tight in interesting
cases.

Motivation: 整合多样化数据对改善科学探索至关重要，该研究旨在建立能编码小鼠行为视频的模型，支持跨学科研究人员研究复杂行为问题。

Method: 使用开源Qwen2.5-VL模型，通过提示工程、上下文学习和帧级预处理来增强性能，无需模型微调。

Conclusion: 该模型将为研究小鼠行为的跨学科研究人员提供支持，使他们能够整合多样化的行为特征，构建可用于解决复杂研究问题的综合数据集。

Abstract: Integration of diverse data will be a pivotal step towards improving
scientific explorations in many disciplines. This work establishes a
vision-language model (VLM) that encodes videos with text input in order to
classify various behaviors of a mouse existing in and engaging with their
environment. Importantly, this model produces a behavioral vector over time for
each subject and for each session the subject undergoes. The output is a
valuable dataset that few programs are able to produce with as high accuracy
and with minimal user input. Specifically, we use the open-source Qwen2.5-VL
model and enhance its performance through prompts, in-context learning (ICL)
with labeled examples, and frame-level preprocessing. We found that each of
these methods contributes to improved classification, and that combining them
results in strong F1 scores across all behaviors, including rare classes like
freezing and fleeing, without any model fine-tuning. Overall, this model will
support interdisciplinary researchers studying mouse behavior by enabling them
to integrate diverse behavioral features, measured across multiple time points
and environments, into a comprehensive dataset that can address complex
research questions.

Motivation: 随机自然梯度变分推断虽然在实践中广泛应用，但其理论基础有限，特别是在非共轭似然情况下。现有收敛保证仅适用于共轭模型，无法扩展到非共轭设置。

Method: 针对均值场参数化，推导了变分损失满足相对平滑性的充分条件；提出了结合非欧投影的改进NGVI算法；在额外结构假设下分析了变分损失的隐藏凸性。

Conclusion: 该工作显著推进了NGVI在非共轭模型中的理论理解，为变分推断的收敛行为提供了新的几何视角和理论保证。

Abstract: Stochastic Natural Gradient Variational Inference (NGVI) is a widely used
method for approximating posterior distribution in probabilistic models.
Despite its empirical success and foundational role in variational inference,
its theoretical underpinnings remain limited, particularly in the case of
non-conjugate likelihoods. While NGVI has been shown to be a special instance
of Stochastic Mirror Descent, and recent work has provided convergence
guarantees using relative smoothness and strong convexity for conjugate models,
these results do not extend to the non-conjugate setting, where the variational
loss becomes non-convex and harder to analyze. In this work, we focus on
mean-field parameterization and advance the theoretical understanding of NGVI
in three key directions. First, we derive sufficient conditions under which the
variational loss satisfies relative smoothness with respect to a suitable
mirror map. Second, leveraging this structure, we propose a modified NGVI
algorithm incorporating non-Euclidean projections and prove its global
non-asymptotic convergence to a stationary point. Finally, under additional
structural assumptions about the likelihood, we uncover hidden convexity
properties of the variational loss and establish fast global convergence of
NGVI to a global optimum. These results provide new insights into the geometry
and convergence behavior of NGVI in challenging inference settings.

TL;DR: 多任务后训练中，不同任务产生的梯度大小存在显著差异，大梯度任务并不一定带来更大的学习收益，这暴露了数据集混合方法的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统多任务后训练假设所有任务贡献相似大小的梯度，但研究发现RL后训练中某些任务会产生显著更大的梯度，导致优化偏向这些任务，而这种梯度不平衡并不能通过学习收益来证明其合理性。

Method: 通过分析不同任务在RL后训练中产生的梯度大小和学习收益之间的关系，研究梯度不平衡现象及其成因。

Result: 发现大梯度任务并不一定带来更大的学习收益，某些情况下甚至比小梯度任务的学习收益更低；梯度不平衡不能通过训练奖励或优势等典型统计量来解释，而是源于任务本身的固有差异。

Conclusion: 需要警惕简单的数据集混合方法，呼吁未来研究开发基于梯度层面的校正方法来解决LLMs中的梯度不平衡问题。

Abstract: Multi-task post-training of large language models (LLMs) is typically
performed by mixing datasets from different tasks and optimizing them jointly.
This approach implicitly assumes that all tasks contribute gradients of similar
magnitudes; when this assumption fails, optimization becomes biased toward
large-gradient tasks. In this paper, however, we show that this assumption
fails in RL post-training: certain tasks produce significantly larger
gradients, thus biasing updates toward those tasks. Such gradient imbalance
would be justified only if larger gradients implied larger learning gains on
the tasks (i.e., larger performance improvements) -- but we find this is not
true. Large-gradient tasks can achieve similar or even much lower learning
gains than small-gradient ones. Further analyses reveal that these gradient
imbalances cannot be explained by typical training statistics such as training
rewards or advantages, suggesting that they arise from the inherent differences
between tasks. This cautions against naive dataset mixing and calls for future
work on principled gradient-level corrections for LLMs.

Motivation: 解决多智能体系统中通信受限的问题，通过减少通信频率来降低通信负担，同时维持系统协调性。

Method: 采用去中心化actor-critic框架，每个智能体在与其邻居交换信息之前进行多次局部策略和价值函数更新，其中价值函数由多层神经网络近似。

Result: 在马尔可夫采样下建立了有限时间收敛分析，达到ε精度稳定点的样本复杂度为O(ε⁻³)，通信复杂度为O(ε⁻¹τ⁻¹)，其中τ为局部训练步数。

Conclusion: 该算法在合作控制场景中的数值实验验证了理论发现，展示了在减少通信的同时保持协调的有效性。

Abstract: In this paper, we study the problem of reinforcement learning in multi-agent
systems where communication among agents is limited. We develop a decentralized
actor-critic learning framework in which each agent performs several local
updates of its policy and value function, where the latter is approximated by a
multi-layer neural network, before exchanging information with its neighbors.
This local training strategy substantially reduces the communication burden
while maintaining coordination across the network. We establish finite-time
convergence analysis for the algorithm under Markov-sampling. Specifically, to
attain the $\varepsilon$-accurate stationary point, the sample complexity is of
order $\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon^{-3})$ and the communication complexity is of
order $\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon^{-1}\tau^{-1})$, where tau denotes the number of
local training steps. We also show how the final error bound depends on the
neural network's approximation quality. Numerical experiments in a cooperative
control setting illustrate and validate the theoretical findings.

Conclusion: ADGNN通过主动扩散机制成功解决了传统扩散方法的过平滑问题，在保持节点特征的同时获得了对图全局结构的全面洞察。

Abstract: The analogy to heat diffusion has enhanced our understanding of information
flow in graphs and inspired the development of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs).
However, most diffusion-based GNNs emulate passive heat diffusion, which still
suffers from over-smoothing and limits their ability to capture global graph
information. Inspired by the heat death of the universe, which posits that
energy distribution becomes uniform over time in a closed system, we recognize
that, without external input, node representations in a graph converge to
identical feature vectors as diffusion progresses. To address this issue, we
propose the Active Diffusion-based Graph Neural Network (ADGNN). ADGNN achieves
active diffusion by integrating multiple external information sources that
dynamically influence the diffusion process, effectively overcoming the
over-smoothing problem. Furthermore, our approach realizes true infinite
diffusion by directly calculating the closed-form solution of the active
diffusion iterative formula. This allows nodes to preserve their unique
characteristics while efficiently gaining comprehensive insights into the
graph's global structure. We evaluate ADGNN against several state-of-the-art
GNN models across various graph tasks. The results demonstrate that ADGNN
significantly improves both accuracy and efficiency, highlighting its
effectiveness in capturing global graph information and maintaining node
distinctiveness.

Abstract: Knowledge distillation (KD) techniques have emerged as a powerful tool for
transferring expertise from complex teacher models to lightweight student
models, particularly beneficial for deploying high-performance models in
resource-constrained devices. This approach has been successfully applied to
graph neural networks (GNNs), harnessing their expressive capabilities to
generate node embeddings that capture structural and feature-related
information. In this study, we depart from the conventional KD approach by
exploring the potential of collaborative learning among GNNs. In the absence of
a pre-trained teacher model, we show that relatively simple and shallow GNN
architectures can synergetically learn efficient models capable of performing
better during inference, particularly in tackling multiple tasks. We propose a
collaborative learning framework where ensembles of student GNNs mutually teach
each other throughout the training process. We introduce an adaptive logit
weighting unit to facilitate efficient knowledge exchange among models and an
entropy enhancement technique to improve mutual learning. These components
dynamically empower the models to adapt their learning strategies during
training, optimizing their performance for downstream tasks. Extensive
experiments conducted on three datasets each for node and graph classification
demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统近似遗忘方法作为单目标优化问题面临三个主要挑战：过度遗忘风险、缺乏对遗忘过程的细粒度控制、以及缺乏全面评估权衡的指标。需要一种能够精确控制遗忘强度的方法。

Method: 将机器遗忘重新定义为多目标优化问题，提出CUP算法，采用梯度枢轴机制，通过单个直观的超参数'遗忘强度'来可控地导航整个帕累托前沿。

Result: 实验结果表明，CUP能够生成更优的帕累托最优解集，在各种视觉任务中持续优于现有方法。使用超体积指标评估，该指标能捕捉算法生成解集的质量和多样性。

Conclusion: CUP算法通过多目标优化框架和梯度枢轴机制，成功解决了机器遗忘中的权衡问题，提供了精确的遗忘强度控制，并在多个任务中展现出优越性能。

Abstract: Machine unlearning (MU) aims to remove the influence of specific data from a
trained model. However, approximate unlearning methods, often formulated as a
single-objective optimization (SOO) problem, face a critical trade-off between
unlearning efficacy and model fidelity. This leads to three primary challenges:
the risk of over-forgetting, a lack of fine-grained control over the unlearning
process, and the absence of metrics to holistically evaluate the trade-off. To
address these issues, we reframe MU as a multi-objective optimization (MOO)
problem. We then introduce a novel algorithm, Controllable Unlearning by
Pivoting Gradient (CUP), which features a unique pivoting mechanism. Unlike
traditional MOO methods that converge to a single solution, CUP's mechanism is
designed to controllably navigate the entire Pareto frontier. This navigation
is governed by a single intuitive hyperparameter, the `unlearning intensity',
which allows for precise selection of a desired trade-off. To evaluate this
capability, we adopt the hypervolume indicator, a metric that captures both the
quality and diversity of the entire set of solutions an algorithm can generate.
Our experimental results demonstrate that CUP produces a superior set of
Pareto-optimal solutions, consistently outperforming existing methods across
various vision tasks.

Abstract: Infants discover categories, detect novelty, and adapt to new contexts
without supervision -- a challenge for current machine learning. We present a
brain-inspired perspective on configurations, a finite-resolution clustering
framework that uses a single resolution parameter and attraction-repulsion
dynamics to yield hierarchical organization, novelty sensitivity, and flexible
adaptation. To evaluate these properties, we introduce mheatmap, which provides
proportional heatmaps and a reassignment algorithm to fairly assess
multi-resolution and dynamic behavior. Across datasets, configurations are
competitive on standard clustering metrics, achieve 87% AUC in novelty
detection, and show 35% better stability during dynamic category evolution.
These results position configurations as a principled computational model of
early cognitive categorization and a step toward brain-inspired AI.

Conclusion: 通过异常值处理的案例研究展示了多重偏差如何复杂交互，讨论了研究结果对学习苦涩教训和构建时间序列基础模型的意义。

Abstract: Time series foundation models (TSFMs) are a class of potentially powerful,
general-purpose tools for time series forecasting and related temporal tasks,
but their behavior is strongly shaped by subtle inductive biases in their
design. Rather than developing a new model and claiming that it is better than
existing TSFMs, e.g., by winning on existing well-established benchmarks, our
objective is to understand how the various ``knobs'' of the training process
affect model quality. Using a mix of theory and controlled empirical
evaluation, we identify several design choices (patch size, embedding choice,
training objective, etc.) and show how they lead to implicit biases in
fundamental model properties (temporal behavior, geometric structure, how
aggressively or not the model regresses to the mean, etc.); and we show how
these biases can be intuitive or very counterintuitive, depending on properties
of the model and data. We also illustrate in a case study on outlier handling
how multiple biases can interact in complex ways; and we discuss implications
of our results for learning the bitter lesson and building TSFMs.

Motivation: 在高风险决策中，可解释的强化学习策略至关重要，但在马尔可夫决策过程中优化决策树策略仍然具有挑战性。

Method: 将优化问题表述为混合整数线性规划，采用缩减空间的分支定界方法，解耦MDP动态和树结构约束，实现高效并行搜索。

Result: 在标准基准测试中，SPOT实现了显著加速，可扩展到具有更多状态的更大MDP，决策树策略保持可解释性和紧凑性，性能不妥协。

Conclusion: 该方法同时实现了可解释性和可扩展性，以比现有方法快一个数量级的速度提供高质量策略。

Abstract: Interpretable reinforcement learning policies are essential for high-stakes
decision-making, yet optimizing decision tree policies in Markov Decision
Processes (MDPs) remains challenging. We propose SPOT, a novel method for
computing decision tree policies, which formulates the optimization problem as
a mixed-integer linear program (MILP). To enhance efficiency, we employ a
reduced-space branch-and-bound approach that decouples the MDP dynamics from
tree-structure constraints, enabling efficient parallel search. This
significantly improves runtime and scalability compared to previous methods.
Our approach ensures that each iteration yields the optimal decision tree.
Experimental results on standard benchmarks demonstrate that SPOT achieves
substantial speedup and scales to larger MDPs with a significantly higher
number of states. The resulting decision tree policies are interpretable and
compact, maintaining transparency without compromising performance. These
results demonstrate that our approach simultaneously achieves interpretability
and scalability, delivering high-quality policies an order of magnitude faster
than existing approaches.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度强化学习虽然性能卓越但缺乏可解释性，限制了对其策略行为的信任。现有的SILVER框架仅限于低维、二元动作领域，无法处理多动作和高维环境。

Method: 首先从图像观察中提取紧凑特征表示，执行基于SHAP的特征归因，然后采用RL引导标记生成行为一致的边界数据集，最后训练决策树和回归函数等替代模型来解释RL策略的决策结构。

Result: 在两个Atari环境中使用三种深度RL算法进行评估，并通过人类主体研究评估可解释策略的清晰度和可信度。结果表明该方法在保持竞争性任务性能的同时，显著提高了透明度和人类对智能体行为的理解。

Conclusion: 通过将SILVER转变为可扩展且行为感知的框架，推进了可解释强化学习在高维多动作设置中解释深度RL智能体的能力。

Abstract: Deep reinforcement learning (RL) achieves remarkable performance but lacks
interpretability, limiting trust in policy behavior. The existing SILVER
framework (Li, Siddique, and Cao 2025) explains RL policy via Shapley-based
regression but remains restricted to low-dimensional, binary-action domains. We
propose SILVER with RL-guided labeling, an enhanced variant that extends SILVER
to multi-action and high-dimensional environments by incorporating the RL
policy's own action outputs into the boundary points identification. Our method
first extracts compact feature representations from image observations,
performs SHAP-based feature attribution, and then employs RL-guided labeling to
generate behaviorally consistent boundary datasets. Surrogate models, such as
decision trees and regression-based functions, are subsequently trained to
interpret RL policy's decision structure. We evaluate the proposed framework on
two Atari environments using three deep RL algorithms and conduct human-subject
study to assess the clarity and trustworthiness of the derived interpretable
policy. Results show that our approach maintains competitive task performance
while substantially improving transparency and human understanding of agent
behavior. This work advances explainable RL by transforming SILVER into a
scalable and behavior-aware framework for interpreting deep RL agents in
high-dimensional, multi-action settings.

Conclusion: 配置比寄存器令牌具有更低的冗余性，并且消除了临时选择的需要。GraMixC作为一种即插即用模块，能够有效提取和融合配置，显著提升下游任务的性能。

Abstract: Humans possess an innate ability to group objects by similarity, a cognitive
mechanism that clustering algorithms aim to emulate. Recent advances in
community detection have enabled the discovery of configurations -- valid
hierarchical clusterings across multiple resolution scales -- without requiring
labeled data. In this paper, we formally characterize these configurations and
identify similar emergent structures in register tokens within Vision
Transformers. Unlike register tokens, configurations exhibit lower redundancy
and eliminate the need for ad hoc selection. They can be learned through
unsupervised or self-supervised methods, yet their selection or composition
remains specific to the downstream task and input. Building on these insights,
we introduce GraMixC, a plug-and-play module that extracts configurations,
aligns them using our Reverse Merge/Split (RMS) technique, and fuses them via
attention heads before forwarding them to any downstream predictor. On the DSN1
16S rRNA cultivation-media prediction task, GraMixC improves the R2 score from
0.6 to 0.9 across multiple methods, setting a new state of the art. We further
validate GraMixC on standard tabular benchmarks, where it consistently
outperforms single-resolution and static-feature baselines.

fairness in regression tasks remains underexplored. Existing approaches mainly
target classification and representation-level debiasing, which cannot fully
address the continuous nature of node-level regression. We propose FnRGNN, a
fairness-aware in-processing framework for GNN-based node regression that
applies interventions at three levels: (i) structure-level edge reweighting,
(ii) representation-level alignment via MMD, and (iii) prediction-level
normalization through Sinkhorn-based distribution matching. This multi-level
strategy ensures robust fairness under complex graph topologies. Experiments on
four real-world datasets demonstrate that FnRGNN reduces group disparities
without sacrificing performance. Code is available at

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了CAB框架，通过注意力桥和灵活的层间对齐策略，实现从Transformer教师模型到状态空间学生模型的高效知识蒸馏


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 状态空间模型虽然具有可扩展性优势，但训练成本高且生态系统不成熟，与Transformer的结构异质性使得知识蒸馏困难

Method: 使用轻量级注意力桥实现token级监督，结合灵活的层间对齐策略来处理架构差异

Result: 在视觉和语言领域的广泛实验中，该方法在有限训练数据下持续提升状态空间模型性能，优于标准和跨架构蒸馏方法

Conclusion: 基于注意力的知识可以有效转移到循环模型中，为构建更强的SSM社区提供了快速利用Transformer专业知识的途径

Abstract: State-space models (SSMs) have emerged as efficient alternatives to
Transformers for sequence modeling, offering superior scalability through
recurrent structures. However, their training remains costly and the ecosystem
around them is far less mature than that of Transformers. Moreover, the
structural heterogeneity between SSMs and Transformers makes it challenging to
efficiently distill knowledge from pretrained attention models. In this work,
we propose Cross-architecture distillation via Attention Bridge (CAB), a novel
data-efficient distillation framework that efficiently transfers attention
knowledge from Transformer teachers to state-space student models. Unlike
conventional knowledge distillation that transfers knowledge only at the output
level, CAB enables token-level supervision via a lightweight bridge and
flexible layer-wise alignment, improving both efficiency and transferability.
We further introduce flexible layer-wise alignment strategies to accommodate
architectural discrepancies between teacher and student. Extensive experiments
across vision and language domains demonstrate that our method consistently
improves the performance of state-space models, even under limited training
data, outperforming both standard and cross-architecture distillation methods.
Our findings suggest that attention-based knowledge can be efficiently
transferred to recurrent models, enabling rapid utilization of Transformer
expertise for building a stronger SSM community.

*Sehyun Park,Jongjin Lee,Yunseop Shin,Ilsang Ohn,Yongdai Kim*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为高斯蒸馏的新方法，通过深度潜在因子模型将教师集成压缩为学生分布，解决了传统知识蒸馏在不确定性量化方面的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度集成虽然能提供最先进的不确定性量化，但计算和内存需求大，难以部署到实际应用中。现有的知识蒸馏技术难以保持不确定性，因为减小DNN尺寸通常会导致变异减少。

Method: 使用深度潜在因子模型将教师集成视为随机过程的实现，通过期望最大化算法稳定估计均值和协方差函数，实现分布蒸馏。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上，高斯蒸馏优于现有基线方法，在语言模型微调和分布偏移问题上表现良好。

Conclusion: 高斯蒸馏是一种有效的分布蒸馏方法，能够在压缩模型的同时保持不确定性量化能力。

Abstract: Deep ensembles deliver state-of-the-art, reliable uncertainty quantification,
but their heavy computational and memory requirements hinder their practical
deployments to real applications such as on-device AI. Knowledge distillation
compresses an ensemble into small student models, but existing techniques
struggle to preserve uncertainty partly because reducing the size of DNNs
typically results in variation reduction. To resolve this limitation, we
introduce a new method of distribution distillation (i.e. compressing a teacher
ensemble into a student distribution instead of a student ensemble) called
Gaussian distillation, which estimates the distribution of a teacher ensemble
through a special Gaussian process called the deep latent factor model (DLF) by
treating each member of the teacher ensemble as a realization of a certain
stochastic process. The mean and covariance functions in the DLF model are
estimated stably by using the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm. By using
multiple benchmark datasets, we demonstrate that the proposed Gaussian
distillation outperforms existing baselines. In addition, we illustrate that
Gaussian distillation works well for fine-tuning of language models and
distribution shift problems.

*Mingyu Jo,Jaesik Yoon,Justin Deschenaux,Caglar Gulcehre,Sungjin Ahn*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出Loopholing机制，通过确定性潜在路径保留分布信息，解决了离散扩散模型采样时信息丢失的问题，显著提升文本生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 离散扩散模型在并行解码时存在采样墙问题：一旦进行类别采样，丰富的分布信息会坍缩为one-hot向量，无法在步骤间传播，导致后续步骤信息受限。

Method: 引入Loopholing机制，通过确定性潜在路径保留分布信息，结合自条件训练策略，构建Loopholing离散扩散模型(LDDMs)。

Result: 生成困惑度比基线降低高达61%，接近甚至超越自回归模型性能，在算术推理任务(如Countdown和Game of 24)上表现更好，生成文本更连贯。

Conclusion: Loopholing机制有效缓解了空闲步骤和振荡问题，为非自回归文本生成提供了可扩展的高质量解决方案。

Abstract: Discrete diffusion models offer a promising alternative to autoregressive
generation through parallel decoding, but they suffer from a sampling wall:
once categorical sampling occurs, rich distributional information collapses
into one-hot vectors and cannot be propagated across steps, forcing subsequent
steps to operate with limited information. To mitigate this problem, we
introduce Loopholing, a novel and simple mechanism that preserves this
information via a deterministic latent pathway, leading to Loopholing Discrete
Diffusion Models (LDDMs). Trained efficiently with a self-conditioning
strategy, LDDMs achieve substantial gains-reducing generative perplexity by up
to 61% over prior baselines, closing (and in some cases surpassing) the gap
with autoregressive models, and producing more coherent text. Applied to
reasoning tasks, LDDMs also improve performance on arithmetic benchmarks such
as Countdown and Game of 24. These results also indicate that loopholing
mitigates idle steps and oscillations, providing a scalable path toward
high-quality non-autoregressive text generation.

Motivation: 传统物种监测方法覆盖范围有限且不完整，需要更精确的物种分布建模来支持保护工作。

Method: 使用深度学习、数据插补、数据平衡和特征选择技术，构建多模态集成模型，整合土地覆盖、NDVI等环境变量。

Result: 多模态集成模型在未见区域表现出强大的泛化能力，青蛙计数和栖息地分类分别达到84.9%准确率和0.90 AUC。

Conclusion: 多模态学习和数据预处理技术能够显著改善生态建模的预测能力，为生物多样性监测提供更精确和可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Monitoring species distribution is vital for conservation efforts, enabling
the assessment of environmental impacts and the development of effective
preservation strategies. Traditional data collection methods, including citizen
science, offer valuable insights but remain limited in coverage and
completeness. Species Distribution Modelling (SDM) helps address these gaps by
using occurrence data and environmental variables to predict species presence
across large regions. In this study, we enhance SDM accuracy for frogs (Anura)
by applying deep learning and data imputation techniques using data from the
"EY - 2022 Biodiversity Challenge." Our experiments show that data balancing
significantly improved model performance, reducing the Mean Absolute Error
(MAE) from 189 to 29 in frog counting tasks. Feature selection identified key
environmental factors influencing occurrence, optimizing inputs while
maintaining predictive accuracy. The multimodal ensemble model, integrating
land cover, NDVI, and other environmental inputs, outperformed individual
models and showed robust generalization across unseen regions. The fusion of
image and tabular data improved both frog counting and habitat classification,
achieving 84.9% accuracy with an AUC of 0.90. This study highlights the
potential of multimodal learning and data preprocessing techniques such as
balancing and imputation to improve predictive ecological modeling when data
are sparse or incomplete, contributing to more precise and scalable
biodiversity monitoring.

Motivation: 机器学习模型在决策和风险评估中需要高度可靠的预测，特别是校准性能在临床预测等关键决策中至关重要。虽然校准通常被忽视，但它对于确保预测概率的准确性极为重要。

Method: 利用学习到的输入样本表示簇，训练校准函数集合的校准管道。该通用方案适应任何底层表示、聚类、校准方法和度量，提供灵活性。

Result: 将各种方法的校准分数从82.28%提升到100%，并引入了确保模型选择同时优化判别和校准的独特匹配度量。

Conclusion: 该方法在常用校准方法中展现出卓越性能，为机器学习模型提供了同时优化判别能力和校准性能的有效解决方案。

Abstract: Machine learning models are essential for decision-making and risk
assessment, requiring highly reliable predictions in terms of both
discrimination and calibration. While calibration often receives less
attention, it is crucial for critical decisions, such as those in clinical
predictions. We introduce a novel calibration pipeline that leverages an
ensemble of calibration functions trained on clusters of learned
representations of the input samples to enhance overall calibration. This
approach not only improves the calibration score of various methods from 82.28%
up to 100% but also introduces a unique matching metric that ensures model
selection optimizes both discrimination and calibration. Our generic scheme
adapts to any underlying representation, clustering, calibration methods and
metric, offering flexibility and superior performance across commonly used
calibration methods.

Motivation: 解决长上下文推理场景中的I/O和计算开销问题，通过混合注意力架构优化推理效率。

Method: 采用线性注意力和softmax注意力的混合架构，系统探索不同注意力机制的比例，并使用自研的高性能FP8算子库linghe。

Conclusion: Ring-linear模型系列通过混合注意力架构和高效算子库，在保持高性能的同时显著降低了推理和训练成本，为长上下文推理提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: In this technical report, we present the Ring-linear model series,
specifically including Ring-mini-linear-2.0 and Ring-flash-linear-2.0.
Ring-mini-linear-2.0 comprises 16B parameters and 957M activations, while
Ring-flash-linear-2.0 contains 104B parameters and 6.1B activations. Both
models adopt a hybrid architecture that effectively integrates linear attention
and softmax attention, significantly reducing I/O and computational overhead in
long-context inference scenarios. Compared to a 32 billion parameter dense
model, this series reduces inference cost to 1/10, and compared to the original
Ring series, the cost is also reduced by over 50%. Furthermore, through
systematic exploration of the ratio between different attention mechanisms in
the hybrid architecture, we have identified the currently optimal model
structure. Additionally, by leveraging our self-developed high-performance FP8
operator library-linghe, overall training efficiency has been improved by 50%.
Benefiting from the high alignment between the training and inference engine
operators, the models can undergo long-term, stable, and highly efficient
optimization during the reinforcement learning phase, consistently maintaining
SOTA performance across multiple challenging complex reasoning benchmarks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文分析了时间序列基础模型（TSFMs）的预测类型对实际应用价值的影响，指出虽然这些模型在预测精度上表现良好，但预测形式（点预测、分位数预测、参数预测或轨迹集成预测）决定了其能支持的操作任务类型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前时间序列基础模型主要关注预测精度，但忽略了预测形式对实际应用价值的关键影响。许多操作任务需要轨迹集成预测来保持时间依赖性，而现有模型大多只提供点预测或参数预测。

Method: 通过调查近期TSFMs，分析不同预测类型之间的转换可能性，证明边际分布无法确定路径依赖事件概率，并将六种基本预测任务映射到最小充分预测类型。

Result: 研究发现三分之二的TSFMs只产生点预测或参数预测，而许多操作任务需要轨迹集成预测。轨迹集成可以通过边际化转换为更简单的形式，但反向转换需要额外假设。

Conclusion: 预测类型而非精度决定了实际效用，需要任务对齐的评估框架来确保预测模型能够支持特定的操作需求。

Abstract: Time-series foundation models (TSFMs) achieve strong forecast accuracy, yet
accuracy alone does not determine practical value. The form of a forecast --
point, quantile, parametric, or trajectory ensemble -- fundamentally constrains
which operational tasks it can support. We survey recent TSFMs and find that
two-thirds produce only point or parametric forecasts, while many operational
tasks require trajectory ensembles that preserve temporal dependence. We
establish when forecast types can be converted and when they cannot: trajectory
ensembles convert to simpler forms via marginalization without additional
assumptions, but the reverse requires imposing temporal dependence through
copulas or conformal methods. We prove that marginals cannot determine
path-dependent event probabilities -- infinitely many joint distributions share
identical marginals but yield different answers to operational questions. We
map six fundamental forecasting tasks to minimal sufficient forecast types and
provide a task-aligned evaluation framework. Our analysis clarifies when
forecast type, not accuracy, differentiates practical utility.

Motivation: 传统对抗样本关注微小扰动导致模型错误分类，本文探索相反方向：显著不同但保持相同分类结果的样本，揭示样本空间中对抗样本的广泛分布。

Method: 提出了负向迭代快速梯度符号法(NI-FGSM)、负向迭代快速梯度法(NI-FGM)及其动量变体NMI-FGSM和NMI-FGM，通过迭代优化生成与原始样本差异最大化但分类结果相同的样本。

Result: 成功生成了与原始样本显著不同但保持相同分类的对抗样本，证明此类样本不仅存在于原始样本邻域，而是广泛分布于整个样本空间。

Conclusion: 对抗样本在样本空间中的分布比传统认知更广泛，这种反向对抗样本可用于特定场景下的机器学习系统攻击，并揭示了模型决策边界的复杂性。

Abstract: Most machine learning models are vulnerable to adversarial examples, which
poses security concerns on these models. Adversarial examples are crafted by
applying subtle but intentionally worst-case modifications to examples from the
dataset, leading the model to output a different answer from the original
example. In this paper, adversarial examples are formed in an exactly opposite
manner, which are significantly different from the original examples but result
in the same answer. We propose a novel set of algorithms to produce such
adversarial examples, including the negative iterative fast gradient sign
method (NI-FGSM) and the negative iterative fast gradient method (NI-FGM),
along with their momentum variants: the negative momentum iterative fast
gradient sign method (NMI-FGSM) and the negative momentum iterative fast
gradient method (NMI-FGM). Adversarial examples constructed by these methods
could be used to perform an attack on machine learning systems in certain
occasions. Moreover, our results show that the adversarial examples are not
merely distributed in the neighbourhood of the examples from the dataset;
instead, they are distributed extensively in the sample space.

Motivation: 分支定界求解器的性能很大程度上受变量选择启发式的影响，现有工作尝试用强化学习学习最优分支策略，但缺乏统一的MDP框架。

Method: 提出了BBMDP——一种用于分支定界变量选择的纯MDP公式，能够利用广泛的RL算法来学习最优分支启发式策略。

Result: 计算实验验证了该模型的有效性，在四个标准MILP基准测试中，作者的分支代理超越了先前最先进的RL代理。

Conclusion: BBMDP提供了一个原则性的MDP框架，能够有效学习分支定界中的最优变量选择策略，显著提升了求解性能。

Abstract: Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) is a powerful framework used to
address a wide range of NP-hard combinatorial optimization problems, often
solved by Branch and Bound (B&B). A key factor influencing the performance of
B&B solvers is the variable selection heuristic governing branching decisions.
Recent contributions have sought to adapt reinforcement learning (RL)
algorithms to the B&B setting to learn optimal branching policies, through
Markov Decision Processes (MDP) inspired formulations, and ad hoc convergence
theorems and algorithms. In this work, we introduce BBMDP, a principled vanilla
MDP formulation for variable selection in B&B, allowing to leverage a broad
range of RL algorithms for the purpose of learning optimal B\&B heuristics.
Computational experiments validate our model empirically, as our branching
agent outperforms prior state-of-the-art RL agents on four standard MILP
benchmarks.

Conclusion: Scalable LinUCB算法显著降低了线性上下文赌博机的计算和内存需求，同时保持性能

Abstract: Linear contextual bandits, especially LinUCB, are widely used in recommender
systems. However, its training, inference, and memory costs grow with feature
dimensionality and the size of the action space. The key bottleneck becomes the
need to update, invert and store a design matrix that absorbs contextual
information from interaction history. In this paper, we introduce Scalable
LinUCB, the algorithm that enables fast and memory efficient operations with
the inverse regularized design matrix. We achieve this through a dynamical
low-rank parametrization of its inverse Cholesky-style factors. We derive
numerically stable rank-1 and batched updates that maintain the inverse without
directly forming the entire matrix. To control memory growth, we employ a
projector-splitting integrator for dynamical low-rank approximation, yielding
average per-step update cost $O(dr)$ and memory $O(dr)$ for approximation rank
$r$. Inference complexity of the suggested algorithm is $O(dr)$ per action
evaluation. Experiments on recommender system datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness of our algorithm.

Conclusion: 该框架在严重环境干扰下仍保持鲁棒性，适用于网络物理系统中的安全智能导航。

Abstract: Data-driven inertial sequence learning has revolutionized navigation in
GPS-denied environments, offering superior odometric resolution compared to
traditional Bayesian methods. However, deep learning-based inertial tracking
systems remain vulnerable to privacy breaches that can expose sensitive
training data. \hl{Existing differential privacy solutions often compromise
model performance by introducing excessive noise, particularly in
high-frequency inertial measurements.} In this article, we propose ConvXformer,
a hybrid architecture that fuses ConvNeXt blocks with Transformer encoders in a
hierarchical structure for robust inertial navigation. We propose an efficient
differential privacy mechanism incorporating adaptive gradient clipping and
gradient-aligned noise injection (GANI) to protect sensitive information while
ensuring model performance. Our framework leverages truncated singular value
decomposition for gradient processing, enabling precise control over the
privacy-utility trade-off. Comprehensive performance evaluations on benchmark
datasets (OxIOD, RIDI, RoNIN) demonstrate that ConvXformer surpasses
state-of-the-art methods, achieving more than 40% improvement in positioning
accuracy while ensuring $(\epsilon,\delta)$-differential privacy guarantees. To
validate real-world performance, we introduce the Mech-IO dataset, collected
from the mechanical engineering building at KAIST, where intense magnetic
fields from industrial equipment induce significant sensor perturbations. This
demonstrated robustness under severe environmental distortions makes our
framework well-suited for secure and intelligent navigation in cyber-physical
systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 许多系统会随时间老化或退化，但传感器数据中可能没有直接的"年龄"信息。需要从现有多变量时间序列中发现能代表系统老化过程的潜在代理特征。

Method: 使用精心定义的语法生成候选公式，通过优化公式的单调性（基于Spearman秩相关系数）来评估和选择最佳代理特征。

Result: 在人工生成数据集和两个真实世界数据集上的实验表明，该方法能将单调性较低的单传感器组合成单调性高的潜在特征。在InfraWatch结构健康监测项目中，将两个Spearman ρ值分别为0.13和0.09的特征组合成ρ值为0.95的代理特征。

Conclusion: 所提出的方法能够找到可解释的公式，作为系统"年龄"的有效代理，即使单个传感器的单调性很低，也能通过组合获得高单调性的代理特征。

Abstract: Many systems in our world age, degrade or otherwise move slowly but steadily
in a certain direction. When monitoring such systems by means of sensors, one
often assumes that some form of `age' is latently present in the data, but
perhaps the available sensors do not readily provide this useful information.
The task that we study in this paper is to extract potential proxies for this
`age' from the available multi-variate time series without having clear data on
what `age' actually is. We argue that when we find a sensor, or more likely
some discovered function of the available sensors, that is sufficiently
monotonic, that function can act as the proxy we are searching for. Using a
carefully defined grammar and optimising the resulting equations in terms of
monotonicity, defined as the absolute Spearman's Rank Correlation between time
and the candidate formula, the proposed approach generates a set of candidate
features which are then fitted and assessed on monotonicity. The proposed
system is evaluated against an artificially generated dataset and two
real-world datasets. In all experiments, we show that the system is able to
combine sensors with low individual monotonicity into latent features with high
monotonicity. For the real-world dataset of InfraWatch, a structural health
monitoring project, we show that two features with individual absolute
Spearman's $\rho$ values of $0.13$ and $0.09$ can be combined into a proxy with
an absolute Spearman's $\rho$ of $0.95$. This demonstrates that our proposed
method can find interpretable equations which can serve as a proxy for the
`age' of the system.

TL;DR: ADAligner是一个动态、质量感知的图-文本对齐框架，通过根据监督质量动态调整多对多和一对一对齐目标，解决了现有图-文本对齐方法在处理多对多关系和噪声监督时的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的CLIP风格图-文本对齐方法存在两个关键限制：假设节点和文本之间存在严格的一对一对应关系，忽略了现实图中固有的多对多关系；依赖静态对齐目标无法适应不同的数据质量，在噪声监督下变得脆弱。

Method: ADAligner实时估计批次级别的对齐可靠性，并相应调整优化策略：在监督干净时促进软性的子图级多对多对齐，在噪声情况下通过动态过滤低置信度对来强调可靠的一对一对齐。

Result: 在九个不同的TAG数据集上的综合实验表明，ADAligner在零样本/少样本节点分类、链接预测和跨模态检索任务上始终优于先前的图-文本对齐方法，在噪声监督下保持强鲁棒性，与多模态基线相比预训练速度提高了约2到3倍。

Conclusion: ADAligner为现实网络环境中的图-文本表示学习建立了可扩展且可靠的基础，通过动态质量感知机制有效平衡了表达性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Pre-training Graph Foundation Models (GFMs) on text-attributed graphs (TAGs)
is central to web-scale applications such as search, recommendation, and
knowledge discovery. However, existing CLIP-style graph-text aligners face two
key limitations: they assume strict one-to-one correspondences between nodes
and texts, overlooking the inherent many-to-many relations in real-world
graphs; and they rely on static alignment objectives that cannot adapt to
varying data quality, making them brittle under noisy supervision. Together,
these limitations expose a core dilemma: embracing expressive many-to-many
alignment amplifies noise, while reverting to strict one-to-one strategies
sacrifices semantic diversity and fails to handle inherently mismatched pairs.
To address these challenges, we propose ADAligner, a dynamic, quality-aware
graph-text alignment framework that dynamically adjusts between expressive
many-to-many and conservative one-to-one objectives according to supervision
quality. ADAligner estimates batch-level alignment reliability in real time and
adapts its optimization accordingly, promoting soft, subgraph-level
many-to-many alignment when supervision is clean, while emphasizing reliable
one-to-one alignment by dynamically filtering low-confidence pairs under noise.
Theoretically, we prove that this dynamic mechanism forms a stable negative
feedback process, ensuring convergence and robustness. Comprehensive
experiments on nine diverse TAG datasets demonstrate that ADAligner
consistently outperforms prior graph-text aligners on zero-/few-shot node
classification, link prediction and cross-modal retrieval tasks. It maintains
strong robustness under noisy supervision and accelerates pre-training by
approximately 2 to 3 times compared to multimodal baselines, establishing a
scalable and reliable foundation for graph-text representation learning in
real-world web environments.

*Lin Xv,Jingsheng Gao,Xian Gao,Ting Li,Yuzhuo Fu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出CPSVD方法改进基于SVD的LLM压缩，通过智能分割参数矩阵，直接保留高分解误差的列，仅对低误差列应用SVD，并自适应分配非均匀压缩率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有SVD方法将整个参数矩阵统一处理，忽略了SVD近似误差在不同矩阵部分差异显著的问题，导致压缩效果不佳。

Method: CPSVD方法识别并直接保留高分解误差的矩阵列，仅对低分解误差的列应用SVD，同时自适应地为LLM中不同模块分配非均匀压缩率。

Result: 大量实验表明CPSVD在零样本任务上持续优于最先进的基于SVD的LLM压缩方法，实现了更低的困惑度和更高的准确率。

Conclusion: CPSVD通过智能矩阵分割和自适应压缩率分配，显著提升了SVD在LLM压缩中的性能。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) faces a critical
bottleneck in their immense size, necessitating efficient compression
techniques. While Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) is a promising approach,
existing SVD-based methods treat the entire parameter matrix uniformly,
overlooking that SVD approximation errors vary significantly across different
matrix parts, which often leads to suboptimal compression. To address this, we
propose \textbf{C}olumn-\textbf{P}reserving \textbf{S}ingular \textbf{V}alue
\textbf{D}ecomposition (CPSVD), a novel method that refines SVD-based LLM
compression by intelligently segmenting the parameter matrix. Unlike
traditional SVD, CPSVD identifies and directly preserves matrix columns with
high decomposition errors, applying SVD only to columns with low decomposition
errors, while precisely determining the optimal balance point between these two
strategies to minimize error. Furthermore, leveraging the inherent
heterogeneity in decomposition errors across different matrices within an LLM,
CPSVD adaptively allocates non-uniform compression rates to modules within that
layer, while adhering to a target layer-wise compression ratio, thereby further
enhancing compression performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CPSVD
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art SVD-based LLM compression methods,
achieving lower perplexity and higher accuracy on zero-shot tasks.

*Lin Xv,Jingsheng Gao,Xian Gao,Ting Liu,Yuzhuo Fu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种自适应秩分配(ARA)方法，用于解决大语言模型SVD压缩中的秩分配问题，通过专用掩码设计和额外损失函数实现全局最优解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有SVD压缩方法存在局限性：启发式算法搜索空间受限，基于掩码的训练难以有效捕捉奇异值谱与可训练参数的关系，且忽略了增益函数在压缩比为1时的非光滑特性，导致训练陷入局部最优。

Method: ARA方法包含：(1)专用掩码设计，实现保留秩与可训练参数之间的高效映射和更新；(2)额外损失函数，引导参数选择朝向全局最优解。

Result: 在LLaMA2-7B模型上，80%压缩比下，WikiText2困惑度从8.38降至6.42，零样本任务平均准确率相比均匀压缩提升9.72个百分点。

Conclusion: ARA方法在基于SVD的LLM压缩中实现了最先进的性能，证明了该方法在秩分配方面的有效性。

Abstract: In the field of large language model (LLM) compression, singular value
decomposition (SVD) is a widely studied and adopted low-rank decomposition
technique. Since SVD operates exclusively on linear modules, and these modules
in LLMs are separated by nonlinear components, SVD can only be applied
independently to each linear module. Under a global compression ratio
constraint, determining the appropriate rank for different linear modules
becomes a critical problem. Existing approaches, such as heuristic algorithms
and mask-based training, have made progress in addressing this challenge.
However, these methods still suffer from several limitations: heuristic
algorithms explore the solution space within restricted regions, while
mask-based training struggles to efficiently capture the relationship between
singular value spectra and trainable parameters. More importantly, current
methods overlook the key property that the gain function is non-smooth at a
compression ratio of 1, which often leads the training process to suboptimal
local minima. To address these issues, we propose an Adaptive Rank Allocation
(ARA) method. Specifically, (1) ARA introduces a dedicated mask design that
enables efficient mapping and updating between retained ranks and trainable
parameters; and (2) it employs an additional loss function to guide parameter
selection toward globally optimal solutions. Experimental results demonstrate
that ARA achieves state-of-the-art performance. On the LLaMA2-7B model with a
80\% compression ratio, ARA reduces perplexity on WikiText2 from 8.38 to 6.42
and improves average zero-shot task accuracy by 9.72 percentage points compared
with uniform compression. These results highlight the effectiveness of our
method for rank allocation in SVD-based LLM compression.

TL;DR: 提出IFeF-PINN算法，通过傅里叶特征增强来克服物理信息神经网络中的频谱偏差问题，实现高频率PDE的准确逼近。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决神经网络在物理信息神经网络训练中优先学习低频特征的频谱偏差问题。

Method: 使用随机傅里叶特征增强潜在空间，创建两阶段训练：估计特征空间基函数和执行回归确定增强基函数系数。

Result: 通过经典基准问题的广泛数值评估，证明了该方法在性能上优于现有最先进算法，并展示了在整个频域上的改进逼近能力。

Conclusion: IFeF-PINN通过傅里叶特征增强有效克服了频谱偏差，能够准确逼近高频率PDE，且迭代训练方案具有收敛性保证。

Abstract: Spectral bias, the tendency of neural networks to learn low-frequency
features first, is a well-known issue with many training algorithms for
physics-informed neural networks (PINNs). To overcome this issue, we propose
IFeF-PINN, an algorithm for iterative training of PINNs with Fourier-enhanced
features. The key idea is to enrich the latent space using high-frequency
components through Random Fourier Features. This creates a two-stage training
problem: (i) estimate a basis in the feature space, and (ii) perform regression
to determine the coefficients of the enhanced basis functions. For an
underlying linear model, it is shown that the latter problem is convex, and we
prove that the iterative training scheme converges. Furthermore, we empirically
establish that Random Fourier Features enhance the expressive capacity of the
network, enabling accurate approximation of high-frequency PDEs. Through
extensive numerical evaluation on classical benchmark problems, the superior
performance of our method over state-of-the-art algorithms is shown, and the
improved approximation across the frequency domain is illustrated.

*Songqi Zhou,Zeyuan Liu,Benben Jiang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FairNet是一个动态实例级公平性校正框架，通过偏置检测器和条件LoRA机制，在保持无偏实例性能的同时，仅对有偏实例进行公平性校正，有效解决了现有方法在性能折衷、静态策略和数据稀疏性方面的局限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有去偏方法存在性能折衷、依赖静态校正策略、难以处理数据稀疏性（特别是少数群体）等问题，且在敏感属性利用上不够优化——要么过度依赖完整标签，要么完全忽略这些属性。

Method: FairNet整合偏置检测器与条件低秩适应（LoRA），仅对识别为有偏的实例激活公平性校正机制；提出新的对比损失函数训练LoRA模块，最小化不同敏感群体间的类内表示差异；可灵活处理完整、部分或完全缺失的敏感属性标签场景。

Result: 理论分析表明，在偏置检测器具有中等TPR/FPR的情况下，FairNet能提升最差群体性能而不降低整体性能，甚至可能带来轻微性能提升；在多种视觉和语言基准测试上的实证评估验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: FairNet提供了一个动态、实例级的公平性校正解决方案，能够在不牺牲整体性能的情况下有效提升少数群体的表现，且对敏感属性标签的完整性要求具有灵活性。

Abstract: Ensuring fairness in machine learning models is a critical challenge.
Existing debiasing methods often compromise performance, rely on static
correction strategies, and struggle with data sparsity, particularly within
minority groups. Furthermore, their utilization of sensitive attributes is
often suboptimal, either depending excessively on complete attribute labeling
or disregarding these attributes entirely. To overcome these limitations, we
propose FairNet, a novel framework for dynamic, instance-level fairness
correction. FairNet integrates a bias detector with conditional low-rank
adaptation (LoRA), which enables selective activation of the fairness
correction mechanism exclusively for instances identified as biased, and
thereby preserve performance on unbiased instances. A key contribution is a new
contrastive loss function for training the LoRA module, specifically designed
to minimize intra-class representation disparities across different sensitive
groups and effectively address underfitting in minority groups. The FairNet
framework can flexibly handle scenarios with complete, partial, or entirely
absent sensitive attribute labels. Theoretical analysis confirms that, under
moderate TPR/FPR for the bias detector, FairNet can enhance the performance of
the worst group without diminishing overall model performance, and potentially
yield slight performance improvements. Comprehensive empirical evaluations
across diverse vision and language benchmarks validate the effectiveness of
FairNet.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的遗忘学习框架，通过联合抑制目标响应和模型信念来对抗梯度上升方法导致的"挤压效应"，实现更彻底的遗忘。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有遗忘学习方法依赖梯度上升来降低目标响应概率，但会导致概率质量重新分布到高似然区域（语义相关的重述），形成"挤压效应"，造成虚假遗忘。

Method: 提出引导式遗忘框架，将挤压效应与模型自身高置信度生成（模型信念）联系起来。通过联合抑制目标响应和模型信念，BS-T方法衰减高概率词元，BS-S方法移除整个高置信度生成序列。

Result: 在多样化基准测试和多种模型家族上的广泛实验证实了该方法的有效性，能够实现更彻底的遗忘同时保持实用性。

Conclusion: 该引导式遗忘框架通过直接对抗挤压效应，解决了现有方法导致的虚假遗忘问题，为语言模型的安全部署提供了更可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models trained on vast corpora inherently risk memorizing
sensitive or harmful content, which may later resurface in their outputs.
Prevailing unlearning methods generally rely on gradient ascent and its
variants to lower the probability of specific target responses. However, we
find that this strategy induces a critical side effect: probability mass is
redistributed into high-likelihood regions, often corresponding to semantically
related rephrasings of the targets. We refer to this as the squeezing effect,
which explains why many methods yield merely spurious unlearning, a problem
further obscured by automated metrics (e.g., ROUGE, truth ratio) that misreport
actual success. To address this, we propose a bootstrapping (BS) framework that
explicitly links the squeezing effect with the model's own high-confidence
generations, namely its model beliefs. Since model beliefs inherently capture
the very high-likelihood regions where probability mass is squeezed,
incorporating them into the unlearning objective directly counters the
squeezing effect. By jointly suppressing both target responses and model
beliefs, BS-T (token) attenuates high-probability tokens, whereas BS-S
(sequence) removes entire high-confidence generations, together achieving more
thorough forgetting while preserving utility. Extensive experiments across
diverse benchmarks with various model families confirm the effectiveness of our
approach.

Method: 使用低秩伯努利专家元模型进行内存高效的dropout率映射，基于任务特定dropout建模条件后验分布，采用基于整个任务数据的新先验优化变分推断。

Result: 在1D随机回归、图像修复和分类等少样本学习任务中，NVDPs相比其他元学习方法表现出优异性能。

Conclusion: NVDPs能够稳健地近似任务特定dropout率，处理广泛的功能模糊性和不确定性，实现快速任务适应。

Abstract: Learning to infer the conditional posterior model is a key step for robust
meta-learning. This paper presents a new Bayesian meta-learning approach called
Neural Variational Dropout Processes (NVDPs). NVDPs model the conditional
posterior distribution based on a task-specific dropout; a low-rank product of
Bernoulli experts meta-model is utilized for a memory-efficient mapping of
dropout rates from a few observed contexts. It allows for a quick
reconfiguration of a globally learned and shared neural network for new tasks
in multi-task few-shot learning. In addition, NVDPs utilize a novel prior
conditioned on the whole task data to optimize the conditional \textit{dropout}
posterior in the amortized variational inference. Surprisingly, this enables
the robust approximation of task-specific dropout rates that can deal with a
wide range of functional ambiguities and uncertainties. We compared the
proposed method with other meta-learning approaches in the few-shot learning
tasks such as 1D stochastic regression, image inpainting, and classification.
The results show the excellent performance of NVDPs.

Motivation: 重新检验Jones等人（2022）提出的修正普适性假设，该假设认为针对特定任务的对抗鲁棒训练模型具有高度相似性。

Method: 在不同数据集上测试该假设的普适性，分析表示相似性和预测行为，并尝试通过重新训练分类器来改善预测行为的普适性。

Result: 在特定设置下验证了Jones关于高表示相似性的主要主张，但结果在不同数据集间不一致。预测行为不会随鲁棒性增加而收敛，但通过重新训练分类器可以实现更普适的预测行为。

Conclusion: 神经网络在特定设置下具有部分普适性，而非严格的普适性概念。

Abstract: The modified universality hypothesis proposed by Jones et al. (2022) suggests
that adversarially robust models trained for a given task are highly similar.
We revisit the hypothesis and test its generality. While we verify Jones' main
claim of high representational similarity in specific settings, results are not
consistent across different datasets. We also discover that predictive behavior
does not converge with increasing robustness and thus is not universal. We find
that differing predictions originate in the classification layer, but show that
more universal predictive behavior can be achieved with simple retraining of
the classifiers. Overall, our work points towards partial universality of
neural networks in specific settings and away from notions of strict
universality.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准DPO方法在蛋白质序列设计中的训练对数量随标注序列呈二次增长，导致训练时间过长，限制了在大规模数据集上的应用。

Method: 使用序列空间聚类来剪枝冗余训练对，同时通过分组近似方法来分摊似然计算，从而减少计算负担。

Result: 在三个蛋白质工程任务中，g-DPO保持了与标准DPO相当的硅内和体外性能，同时训练速度提升了1.8到3.7倍。

Conclusion: g-DPO框架有效解决了DPO的可扩展性瓶颈，在大规模数据集上预期会有更大的性能提升。

Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) is an effective approach for aligning
protein language models with experimental design goals. However, DPO faces a
scalability bottleneck: the number of possible training pairs grows
quadratically with the number of labeled sequences, leading to prohibitive
training times even for modestly sized datasets. We introduce g-DPO, a
framework that (i) uses sequence space clustering to prune redundant pairs
while preserving training signal, and (ii) amortizes likelihood computations
with group-based approximations. Across three protein engineering tasks, g-DPO
maintains in-silico and in-vitro performance that is statistically
indistinguishable from standard DPO, while converging 1.8 to 3.7 times faster,
with greater gains expected as the size of the dataset increases.

Abstract: As AI systems approach dangerous capability levels where inability safety
cases become insufficient, we need alternative approaches to ensure safety.
This paper presents a roadmap for constructing safety cases based on
chain-of-thought (CoT) monitoring in reasoning models and outlines our research
agenda. We argue that CoT monitoring might support both control and
trustworthiness safety cases. We propose a two-part safety case: (1)
establishing that models lack dangerous capabilities when operating without
their CoT, and (2) ensuring that any dangerous capabilities enabled by a CoT
are detectable by CoT monitoring. We systematically examine two threats to
monitorability: neuralese and encoded reasoning, which we categorize into three
forms (linguistic drift, steganography, and alien reasoning) and analyze their
potential drivers. We evaluate existing and novel techniques for maintaining
CoT faithfulness. For cases where models produce non-monitorable reasoning, we
explore the possibility of extracting a monitorable CoT from a non-monitorable
CoT. To assess the viability of CoT monitoring safety cases, we establish
prediction markets to aggregate forecasts on key technical milestones
influencing their feasibility.

Abstract: Recent advancements in graph unlearning models have enhanced model utility by
preserving the node representation essentially invariant, while using gradient
ascent on the forget set to achieve unlearning. However, this approach causes a
drastic degradation in model utility during the unlearning process due to the
rapid divergence speed of gradient ascent. In this paper, we introduce
\textbf{INPO}, an \textbf{I}nfluence-aware \textbf{N}egative
\textbf{P}reference \textbf{O}ptimization framework that focuses on slowing the
divergence speed and improving the robustness of the model utility to the
unlearning process. Specifically, we first analyze that NPO has slower
divergence speed and theoretically propose that unlearning high-influence edges
can reduce impact of unlearning. We design an influence-aware message function
to amplify the influence of unlearned edges and mitigate the tight topological
coupling between the forget set and the retain set. The influence of each edge
is quickly estimated by a removal-based method. Additionally, we propose a
topological entropy loss from the perspective of topology to avoid excessive
information loss in the local structure during unlearning. Extensive
experiments conducted on five real-world datasets demonstrate that INPO-based
model achieves state-of-the-art performance on all forget quality metrics while
maintaining the model's utility. Codes are available at

Conclusion: ELUTQ框架通过HLQ量化格式有效解决了边缘设备上LLM部署的内存和延迟瓶颈，实现了高效的低比特量化推理。

Abstract: The deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) on CPU-based edge devices is
crucial for enabling on-device intelligence and expanding AI accessibility.
However, it remains challenging due to limited memory and computational
resources. During edge inference, memory usage and latency are the primary
bottlenecks. Although weight quantization can effectively reduce memory
consumption, existing hardware-friendly approaches often rely on uniform
quantization, which poorly fits weight distributions and incurs high
dequantization overhead at low bit widths. To address these limitations, we
propose ELUTQ, an efficient quantization framework introducing a novel
quantization format, Hierarchical Linear Quantization (HLQ). HLQ better
captures the statistical characteristics of weights without increasing the
computational cost of Bit-serial LUT-based GEMM operations, thereby eliminating
dequantization overhead. It is orthogonal to existing quantization algorithms
and can be seamlessly integrated into various quantization pipelines. For
efficient on-device deployment, ELUTQ provides optimized CPU kernels for
end-to-end inference. Experiments show that for LLaMA3-8B, HLQ reduces
perplexity by about 8% at 3-bit and 85% at 2-bit precision under post-training
quantization, completing quantization within one hour. With efficient
finetuning, HLQ further improves 2-bit performance within two hours. In terms
of inference efficiency, our 2-bit LLaMA2-7B achieves over 25 tokens/s on an
Apple M2 chip (4 threads, batch size = 1).

Abstract: In the era of large language models (LLMs), weight-activation quantization
helps fit models on edge device by reducing memory and compute bit-widths.
However, three challenges persist for energy constrained hardware: (1) even
after quantization, multiply-accumulate (MAC) operations remain unavoidable and
continue to dominate energy consumption; (2) dequantization (or
per-tensor/channel rescaling) introduces extra arithmetic and data movement,
increasing latency and energy; (3) uniform parameters bit widths clip salient
values-while intra-channel mixed precision is generally impractical on current
matrix hardware and memory. In contrast, brain-inspired Spiking Neural Networks
(SNNs), owing to their binary spike-based information representation and the
Integrate-and-Fire (IF) paradigm, naturally support mixed-precision storage and
energy-efficient computation by replacing complex MACs with temporal Accumulate
(ACCs). Motivated by this property, we propose SpikeQuant, which selectively
applies mixed-precision quantization to activations with salient values and
re-encodes them into binary spike counts, thereby enabling dynamic mixed
storage of different bitwidths. Furthermore, by embedding the quantization
scale into the threshold of the IF mechanism, our approach performs
energy-efficient linear transformations on weights and activations while
avoiding explicit dequantization. Experimental results demonstrate that
SpikeQuant consistently achieves near-FP16 perplexity under W4A4 quantization
while reducing energy cost by up to 4.6 times compared to existing methods,
highlighting its effectiveness for accurate and energy-efficient LLM
deployment.

Abstract: Recent work has demonstrated state-of-the-art results in large language model
(LLM) hallucination detection and mitigation through consistency-based
approaches which involve aggregating multiple responses sampled from a single
LLM for a given prompt. These approaches help offset limitations stemming from
the imperfect data on which LLMs are trained, which includes biases and
under-representation of information required at deployment time among other
limitations which can lead to hallucinations. We show that extending these
single-model consistency methods to combine responses from multiple LLMs with
different training data, training schemes and model architectures can result in
substantial further improvements in hallucination detection and mitigation
capabilities beyond their single-model consistency counterparts. We evaluate
this \emph{consortium consistency} approach across many model teams from a pool
of 15 LLMs and explore under what conditions it is beneficial to team together
different LLMs in this manner. Further, we show that these performance
improvements often come with reduced inference costs, offsetting a significant
drawback with single-model consistency methods.

Result: 生成的稀疏反事实仅修改78%原始信号，在所有类别中保持81.3%有效性，时间稳定性提升43%，心肌梗死类别有效性达98.9%，但肥厚检测面临挑战(13.2%)，支持近实时生成(<1秒)。

Abstract: In eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI), instance-based explanations for
time series have gained increasing attention due to their potential for
actionable and interpretable insights in domains such as healthcare. Addressing
the challenges of explainability of state-of-the-art models, we propose a
prototype-driven framework for generating sparse counterfactual explanations
tailored to 12-lead ECG classification models. Our method employs SHAP-based
thresholds to identify critical signal segments and convert them into interval
rules, uses Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) and medoid clustering to extract
representative prototypes, and aligns these prototypes to query R-peaks for
coherence with the sample being explained. The framework generates
counterfactuals that modify only 78% of the original signal while maintaining
81.3% validity across all classes and achieving 43% improvement in temporal
stability. We evaluate three variants of our approach, Original, Sparse, and
Aligned Sparse, with class-specific performance ranging from 98.9% validity for
myocardial infarction (MI) to challenges with hypertrophy (HYP) detection
(13.2%). This approach supports near realtime generation (< 1 second) of
clinically valid counterfactuals and provides a foundation for interactive
explanation platforms. Our findings establish design principles for
physiologically-aware counterfactual explanations in AI-based diagnosis systems
and outline pathways toward user-controlled explanation interfaces for clinical
deployment.

TL;DR: 提出Bi-DFCL方法解决在线平台营销中的预测-决策错位和偏差-方差困境，通过双层优化框架联合利用观察和实验数据，实现决策质量优化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统两阶段方法存在预测-决策错位问题，且观察数据有偏差、实验数据稀缺，导致营销决策效果不佳。

Method: 开发基于实验数据的无偏决策质量估计器，建立双层优化框架，通过隐式微分联合利用观察和实验数据。

Result: 在公开基准、工业数据集和在线A/B测试中均取得显著改进，已在美团平台部署应用。

Conclusion: Bi-DFCL有效解决了营销决策中的关键挑战，实现了更好的偏差-方差权衡和决策质量。

Abstract: Online Internet platforms require sophisticated marketing strategies to
optimize user retention and platform revenue -- a classical resource allocation
problem. Traditional solutions adopt a two-stage pipeline: machine learning
(ML) for predicting individual treatment effects to marketing actions, followed
by operations research (OR) optimization for decision-making. This paradigm
presents two fundamental technical challenges. First, the prediction-decision
misalignment: Conventional ML methods focus solely on prediction accuracy
without considering downstream optimization objectives, leading to improved
predictive metrics that fail to translate to better decisions. Second, the
bias-variance dilemma: Observational data suffers from multiple biases (e.g.,
selection bias, position bias), while experimental data (e.g., randomized
controlled trials), though unbiased, is typically scarce and costly --
resulting in high-variance estimates. We propose Bi-level Decision-Focused
Causal Learning (Bi-DFCL) that systematically addresses these challenges.
First, we develop an unbiased estimator of OR decision quality using
experimental data, which guides ML model training through surrogate loss
functions that bridge discrete optimization gradients. Second, we establish a
bi-level optimization framework that jointly leverages observational and
experimental data, solved via implicit differentiation. This novel formulation
enables our unbiased OR estimator to correct learning directions from biased
observational data, achieving optimal bias-variance tradeoff. Extensive
evaluations on public benchmarks, industrial marketing datasets, and
large-scale online A/B tests demonstrate the effectiveness of Bi-DFCL, showing
statistically significant improvements over state-of-the-art. Currently,
Bi-DFCL has been deployed at Meituan, one of the largest online food delivery
platforms in the world.

TL;DR: REBMBO结合高斯过程与能量模型，使用PPO算法实现自适应多步前瞻，有效克服传统贝叶斯优化的一步偏差问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统贝叶斯优化方法存在显著的一步偏差，容易收敛到局部最优，在复杂或高维任务中表现不佳。

Method: 将贝叶斯优化迭代定义为马尔可夫决策过程，使用近端策略优化进行自适应多步前瞻，结合高斯过程提供局部指导和能量模型捕获全局结构信息。

Result: 在合成和真实世界基准测试中表现出优越性能，在不同高斯过程配置下展现出适应性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: REBMBO通过集成局部和全局信息，有效克服了传统贝叶斯优化的局限性，在复杂优化任务中表现出色。

Abstract: Existing Bayesian Optimization (BO) methods typically balance exploration and
exploitation to optimize costly objective functions. However, these methods
often suffer from a significant one-step bias, which may lead to convergence
towards local optima and poor performance in complex or high-dimensional tasks.
Recently, Black-Box Optimization (BBO) has achieved success across various
scientific and engineering domains, particularly when function evaluations are
costly and gradients are unavailable. Motivated by this, we propose the
Reinforced Energy-Based Model for Bayesian Optimization (REBMBO), which
integrates Gaussian Processes (GP) for local guidance with an Energy-Based
Model (EBM) to capture global structural information. Notably, we define each
Bayesian Optimization iteration as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and use
Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) for adaptive multi-step lookahead,
dynamically adjusting the depth and direction of exploration to effectively
overcome the limitations of traditional BO methods. We conduct extensive
experiments on synthetic and real-world benchmarks, confirming the superior
performance of REBMBO. Additional analyses across various GP configurations
further highlight its adaptability and robustness.

Result: 在综合控制套件上的基准测试表明，MED-LQ在各种场景下实现了竞争性性能。

Conclusion: MED-LQ展示了在大型马尔可夫决策过程中更广泛应用潜力，为未知动态系统控制提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: We revisit the problem of controlling linear systems with quadratic cost
under unknown dynamics with model-based reinforcement learning. Traditional
methods like Optimism in the Face of Uncertainty and Thompson Sampling, rooted
in multi-armed bandits (MABs), face practical limitations. In contrast, we
propose an alternative based on the Confusing Instance (CI) principle, which
underpins regret lower bounds in MABs and discrete Markov Decision Processes
(MDPs) and is central to the Minimum Empirical Divergence (MED) family of
algorithms, known for their asymptotic optimality in various settings. By
leveraging the structure of LQR policies along with sensitivity and stability
analysis, we develop MED-LQ. This novel control strategy extends the principles
of CI and MED beyond small-scale settings. Our benchmarks on a comprehensive
control suite demonstrate that MED-LQ achieves competitive performance in
various scenarios while highlighting its potential for broader applications in
large-scale MDPs.

Motivation: AI方法在药物发现中的应用受到公共数据集规模和多样性不足的限制，联邦学习虽然能整合私有数据，但联邦数据访问方式使得数据多样性评估等任务变得复杂。

Method: 比较了三种联邦聚类方法（Fed-kMeans、Fed-PCA+Fed-kMeans、Fed-LSH）与其集中式对应方法在八个分子数据集上的表现，使用了标准数学指标和新提出的化学感知指标SF-ICF。

Result: 大规模基准测试显示，结合领域知识的化学感知评估指标对于分子数据的联邦多样性分析至关重要，客户端可解释性分析也具有重要意义。

Conclusion: 在分子数据的联邦多样性分析中，需要结合领域知识并通过化学感知指标和客户端可解释性分析来获得更准确的结果。

Abstract: AI methods are increasingly shaping pharmaceutical drug discovery. However,
their translation to industrial applications remains limited due to their
reliance on public datasets, lacking scale and diversity of proprietary
pharmaceutical data. Federated learning (FL) offers a promising approach to
integrate private data into privacy-preserving, collaborative model training
across data silos. This federated data access complicates important
data-centric tasks such as estimating dataset diversity, performing informed
data splits, and understanding the structure of the combined chemical space. To
address this gap, we investigate how well federated clustering methods can
disentangle and represent distributed molecular data. We benchmark three
approaches, Federated kMeans (Fed-kMeans), Federated Principal Component
Analysis combined with Fed-kMeans (Fed-PCA+Fed-kMeans), and Federated
Locality-Sensitive Hashing (Fed-LSH), against their centralized counterparts on
eight diverse molecular datasets. Our evaluation utilizes both, standard
mathematical and a chemistry-informed evaluation metrics, SF-ICF, that we
introduce in this work. The large-scale benchmarking combined with an in-depth
explainability analysis shows the importance of incorporating domain knowledge
through chemistry-informed metrics, and on-client explainability analyses for
federated diversity analysis on molecular data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机器学习在COVID-19疫情预测中显示出价值，但在地方性传染病预测方面仍未被充分探索，需要开发能够准确预测RSV等疾病的模型。

Method: 基于XGBoost+CNN+BiLSTM的集成模型，结合高分辨率特征学习和长程时间依赖捕捉机制，通过自回归模块训练气候控制的滞后关系，使用随机推理返回概率区间。

Result: 在美国34个州的评估中，ForecastNet-XCL在州内和跨州场景中均可靠地优于统计基线、单个神经网络和传统集成方法，在延长预测时间范围内保持准确性。

Conclusion: ForecastNet-XCL的效率、性能和不确定性感知设计使其成为在气候压力加剧和监测资源受限情况下的可部署早期预警工具。

Abstract: Precise outbreak forecasting of infectious diseases is essential for
effective public health responses and epidemic control. The increased
availability of machine learning (ML) methods for time-series forecasting
presents an enticing avenue to enhance outbreak forecasting. Though the
COVID-19 outbreak demonstrated the value of applying ML models to predict
epidemic profiles, using ML models to forecast endemic diseases remains
underexplored. In this work, we present ForecastNet-XCL (an ensemble model
based on XGBoost+CNN+BiLSTM), a deep learning hybrid framework designed to
addresses this gap by creating accurate multi-week RSV forecasts up to 100
weeks in advance based on climate and temporal data, without access to
real-time surveillance on RSV. The framework combines high-resolution feature
learning with long-range temporal dependency capturing mechanisms, bolstered by
an autoregressive module trained on climate-controlled lagged relations.
Stochastic inference returns probabilistic intervals to inform decision-making.
Evaluated across 34 U.S. states, ForecastNet-XCL reliably outperformed
statistical baselines, individual neural nets, and conventional ensemble
methods in both within- and cross-state scenarios, sustaining accuracy over
extended forecast horizons. Training on climatologically diverse datasets
enhanced generalization furthermore, particularly in locations having irregular
or biennial RSV patterns. ForecastNet-XCL's efficiency, performance, and
uncertainty-aware design make it a deployable early-warning tool amid
escalating climate pressures and constrained surveillance resources.

TL;DR: DiffEvac是一种基于生成模型的新方法，通过学习建筑疏散模式实现高效疏散模拟，相比传统方法建模负担更轻、速度更快。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统疏散模拟依赖精细建模和大量参数，难以在早期设计阶段快速迭代过程中采用，需要更高效的方法。

Method: 建立399个不同功能布局和对应疏散热力图的数据集，提出解耦特征表示嵌入物理特征，基于图像提示的扩散模型学习疏散模式。

Result: 相比现有条件GAN方法，DiffEvac在SSIM上提升37.6%，PSNR提升142%，速度快16倍，模拟时间缩短至2分钟。

Conclusion: 该方法显著增强快速设计迭代过程，为智能建筑安全优化提供新见解，降低建模负担，支持大规模假设探索和多目标设计工具耦合。

Abstract: Evacuation simulation is essential for building safety design, ensuring
properly planned evacuation routes. However, traditional evacuation simulation
relies heavily on refined modeling with extensive parameters, making it
challenging to adopt such methods in a rapid iteration process in early design
stages. Thus, this study proposes DiffEvac, a novel method to learn building
evacuation patterns based on Generative Models (GMs), for efficient evacuation
simulation and enhanced safety design. Initially, a dataset of 399 diverse
functional layouts and corresponding evacuation heatmaps of buildings was
established. Then, a decoupled feature representation is proposed to embed
physical features like layouts and occupant density for GMs. Finally, a
diffusion model based on image prompts is proposed to learn evacuation patterns
from simulated evacuation heatmaps. Compared to existing research using
Conditional GANs with RGB representation, DiffEvac achieves up to a 37.6%
improvement in SSIM, 142% in PSNR, and delivers results 16 times faster,
thereby cutting simulation time to 2 minutes. Case studies further demonstrate
that the proposed method not only significantly enhances the rapid design
iteration and adjustment process with efficient evacuation simulation but also
offers new insights and technical pathways for future safety optimization in
intelligent building design. The research implication is that the approach
lowers the modeling burden, enables large-scale what-if exploration, and
facilitates coupling with multi-objective design tools.

Conclusion: 这项工作代表了开发可微分线性代数工具并将其广泛应用于机器学习实践的下一个迭代。

Abstract: This paper argues that the method of least squares has significant
unfulfilled potential in modern machine learning, far beyond merely being a
tool for fitting linear models. To release its potential, we derive custom
gradients that transform the solver into a differentiable operator, like a
neural network layer, enabling many diverse applications. Empirically, we
demonstrate: (i) scalability by enforcing weight sparsity on a 50 million
parameter model; (ii) imposing conservativeness constraints in score-based
generative models; and (iii) hyperparameter tuning of Gaussian processes based
on predictive performance. By doing this, our work represents the next
iteration in developing differentiable linear-algebra tools and making them
widely accessible to machine learning practitioners.

Motivation: 现有的LoRA变体缺乏明确分离任务相关信息与残差信息的机制，限制了在下游任务中的性能表现。

Method: 使用变分自编码器学习两个不同的潜在空间，通过新的证据下界公式促进潜在空间之间的因子分解，一个空间专门用于任务显著特征，另一个用于残差信息。

Result: 在文本、音频和图像任务上的广泛实验表明，FVAE-LoRA始终优于标准LoRA。虚假相关性评估证实FVAE-LoRA能更好地隔离任务相关信号，在分布偏移下具有更好的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: FVAE-LoRA通过明确分离任务相关特征和残差信息，提高了参数高效微调的性能和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Low-rank adaptation (LoRA) is a widely used method for parameter-efficient
finetuning. However, existing LoRA variants lack mechanisms to explicitly
disambiguate task-relevant information within the learned low-rank subspace,
potentially limiting downstream performance. We propose Factorized Variational
Autoencoder LoRA (FVAE-LoRA), which leverages a VAE to learn two distinct
latent spaces. Our novel Evidence Lower Bound formulation explicitly promotes
factorization between the latent spaces, dedicating one latent space to
task-salient features and the other to residual information. Extensive
experiments on text, audio, and image tasks demonstrate that FVAE-LoRA
consistently outperforms standard LoRA. Moreover, spurious correlation
evaluations confirm that FVAE-LoRA better isolates task-relevant signals,
leading to improved robustness under distribution shifts. Our code is publicly

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的重叠加权正交元学习器，用于在时间变化设置中估计异质处理效应，解决了传统方法在治疗序列重叠度低时的方差爆炸问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在时间变化设置中估计异质处理效应面临严重的数据重叠问题，因为观察到某些治疗序列的概率随着预测时间范围的延长而指数下降，导致现有元学习器在重叠度低时估计方差爆炸。

Method: 开发了一种新颖的重叠加权正交元学习器，通过针对观察数据中接受干预治疗序列概率高的区域进行估计，使用Neyman正交总体风险函数最小化重叠加权的oracle风险。

Result: 通过使用transformer和LSTM骨干网络的广泛实验，证明了新WO学习器的优势，能够获得更可靠的异质处理效应估计。

Conclusion: 提出的WO学习器具有Neyman正交性，对干扰函数的错误设定具有鲁棒性，完全模型无关，可以应用于任何机器学习模型，有效解决了时间变化设置中异质处理效应估计的挑战。

Abstract: Estimating heterogeneous treatment effects (HTEs) in time-varying settings is
particularly challenging, as the probability of observing certain treatment
sequences decreases exponentially with longer prediction horizons. Thus, the
observed data contain little support for many plausible treatment sequences,
which creates severe overlap problems. Existing meta-learners for the
time-varying setting typically assume adequate treatment overlap, and thus
suffer from exploding estimation variance when the overlap is low. To address
this problem, we introduce a novel overlap-weighted orthogonal (WO)
meta-learner for estimating HTEs that targets regions in the observed data with
high probability of receiving the interventional treatment sequences. This
offers a fully data-driven approach through which our WO-learner can counteract
instabilities as in existing meta-learners and thus obtain more reliable HTE
estimates. Methodologically, we develop a novel Neyman-orthogonal population
risk function that minimizes the overlap-weighted oracle risk. We show that our
WO-learner has the favorable property of Neyman-orthogonality, meaning that it
is robust against misspecification in the nuisance functions. Further, our
WO-learner is fully model-agnostic and can be applied to any machine learning
model. Through extensive experiments with both transformer and LSTM backbones,
we demonstrate the benefits of our novel WO-learner.

Motivation: 传统策略学习方法在预测不确定时仍强制决策，这在高风险场景中很危险。需要允许策略在不确定时弃权，选择安全默认选项。

Method: 提出两阶段学习方法：首先识别一组近似最优策略，然后基于它们的分歧构建弃权规则。使用双重稳健目标处理未知倾向得分情况。

Result: 在已知倾向得分时获得O(1/n)型快速后悔保证，并扩展到未知倾向得分情况。弃权机制还能改善边界条件下的性能，连接分布鲁棒策略学习，支持安全策略改进。

Conclusion: 弃权是策略学习中的多功能工具，能在不确定时提供安全机制，同时改善其他核心问题的性能保证。

Abstract: Policy learning algorithms are widely used in areas such as personalized
medicine and advertising to develop individualized treatment regimes. However,
most methods force a decision even when predictions are uncertain, which is
risky in high-stakes settings. We study policy learning with abstention, where
a policy may defer to a safe default or an expert. When a policy abstains, it
receives a small additive reward on top of the value of a random guess. We
propose a two-stage learner that first identifies a set of near-optimal
policies and then constructs an abstention rule from their disagreements. We
establish fast O(1/n)-type regret guarantees when propensities are known, and
extend these guarantees to the unknown-propensity case via a doubly robust (DR)
objective. We further show that abstention is a versatile tool with direct
applications to other core problems in policy learning: it yields improved
guarantees under margin conditions without the common realizability assumption,
connects to distributionally robust policy learning by hedging against small
data shifts, and supports safe policy improvement by ensuring improvement over
a baseline policy with high probability.

approaches. We introduce a dynamic channel selection approach that
stochastically resamples channels between epochs within preselected layers.
Extensive experiments demonstrate TraDy achieves state-of-the-art performance
across various downstream tasks and architectures while maintaining strict

Motivation: 现有的推测解码方法通常只使用单个草稿模型，但实际应用中存在多个潜在草稿模型，从快速但不准确到慢速但可靠的模型都有。为了充分利用这些模型的优势，需要一种能够组合多个草稿模型的方法。

Method: 提出层次化推测解码(HSD)算法，将多个草稿模型堆叠成层次结构。每个模型生成token，下一级更大的模型在单次前向传播中验证这些token，最终由目标模型完成验证。

Result: HSD相比最佳单草稿基线实现了最高1.2倍的加速效果，证明了该算法在减少生成延迟方面的实用性。

Conclusion: HSD算法能够有效利用多个草稿模型的层次结构，在多项式时间内选择延迟最优的层次配置，显著提升了Transformer语言模型的推理效率。

Abstract: Transformer language models generate text autoregressively, making inference
latency proportional to the number of tokens generated. Speculative decoding
reduces this latency without sacrificing output quality, by leveraging a small
draft model to propose tokens that the larger target model verifies in
parallel. In practice, however, there may exist a set of potential draft
models- ranging from faster but less inaccurate, to slower yet more reliable.
We introduce Hierarchical Speculative Decoding (HSD), an algorithm that stacks
these draft models into a hierarchy, where each model proposes tokens, and the
next larger model verifies them in a single forward pass, until finally the
target model verifies tokens. We derive an expression for the expected latency
of any such hierarchy and show that selecting the latency-optimal hierarchy can
be done in polynomial time. Empirically, HSD gives up to 1.2x speed-up over the
best single-draft baseline, demonstrating the practicality of our algorithm in
reducing generation latency beyond previous techniques.

<details>

Motivation: 现有时间序列基础模型存在网络架构庞大、需要大规模预训练数据的问题，难以在资源受限环境中部署。需要在通用性和可负担性之间找到平衡。

Method: 1) 能量感知频谱分解模块：同时建模高能量和低能量频率信号，提高预训练数据利用率；2) 混合提示Transformer：通过数据集特定提示学习异构时序模式，自适应路由时间序列token到基于提示的专家模块。

Conclusion: SEMPO显著减少了预训练数据规模和模型大小，同时保持了强大的泛化能力，为资源受限环境中的时间序列预测提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: The recent boom of large pre-trained models witnesses remarkable success in
developing foundation models (FMs) for time series forecasting. Despite
impressive performance across diverse downstream forecasting tasks, existing
time series FMs possess massive network architectures and require substantial
pre-training on large-scale datasets, which significantly hinders their
deployment in resource-constrained environments. In response to this growing
tension between versatility and affordability, we propose SEMPO, a novel
lightweight foundation model that requires pretraining on relatively
small-scale data, yet exhibits strong general time series forecasting.
Concretely, SEMPO comprises two key modules: 1) energy-aware SpEctral
decomposition module, that substantially improves the utilization of
pre-training data by modeling not only the high-energy frequency signals but
also the low-energy yet informative frequency signals that are ignored in
current methods; and 2) Mixture-of-PrOmpts enabled Transformer, that learns
heterogeneous temporal patterns through small dataset-specific prompts and
adaptively routes time series tokens to prompt-based experts for
parameter-efficient model adaptation across different datasets and domains.
Equipped with these modules, SEMPO significantly reduces both pre-training data
scale and model size, while achieving strong generalization. Extensive
experiments on two large-scale benchmarks covering 16 datasets demonstrate the
superior performance of SEMPO in both zero-shot and few-shot forecasting
scenarios compared with state-of-the-art methods. Code and data are available

Result: Enhanced TimeAutoDiff将真实-合成评估差距减少了70%以上，达到Δ_TRTS ≤ 0.014 AUROC，同时保持训练效用。在32个交叉亚组中，大型合成队列将亚组级AUROC估计误差降低了50%，在72-84%的亚组中优于小型真实测试集。

Conclusion: 这项工作为关键医疗中可信赖、细粒度的模型评估提供了一个实用的隐私保护路线图，能够在不同患者群体中进行稳健可靠的性能分析，而无需暴露敏感EHR数据，有助于提高医疗AI的整体可信度。

Abstract: We present a novel framework for leveraging synthetic ICU time-series data
not only to train but also to rigorously and trustworthily evaluate predictive
models, both at the population level and within fine-grained demographic
subgroups. Building on prior diffusion and VAE-based generators (TimeDiff,
HealthGen, TimeAutoDiff), we introduce \textit{Enhanced TimeAutoDiff}, which
augments the latent diffusion objective with distribution-alignment penalties.
We extensively benchmark all models on MIMIC-III and eICU, on 24-hour mortality
and binary length-of-stay tasks. Our results show that Enhanced TimeAutoDiff
reduces the gap between real-on-synthetic and real-on-real evaluation (``TRTS
gap'') by over 70\%, achieving $\Delta_{TRTS} \leq 0.014$ AUROC, while
preserving training utility ($\Delta_{TSTR} \approx 0.01$). Crucially, for 32
intersectional subgroups, large synthetic cohorts cut subgroup-level AUROC
estimation error by up to 50\% relative to small real test sets, and outperform
them in 72--84\% of subgroups. This work provides a practical,
privacy-preserving roadmap for trustworthy, granular model evaluation in
critical care, enabling robust and reliable performance analysis across diverse
patient populations without exposing sensitive EHR data, contributing to the
overall trustworthiness of Medical AI.

### [96] [Statistical Inference for Linear Functionals of Online Least-squares SGD when $t \gtrsim d^{1+δ}$](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19734)
*Bhavya Agrawalla,Krishnakumar Balasubramanian,Promit Ghosal*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文为在线最小二乘SGD建立了非渐近Berry-Esseen界限，在增长维度机制下提供高斯中心极限定理，显著扩展了先前工作的维度范围并提高了计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在关键应用中使用SGD需要量化其不确定性，现有高维推断方法计算成本高且维度扩展受限。

Method: 提出基于在线SGD的程序，开发在线方差估计器，并建立该估计器的高概率偏差界限。

Result: 证明当迭代次数增长为t ≳ d^(1+δ)时，SGD迭代满足CLT，运行时间为O(td)，内存需求为O(d)，优于现有方法的O(td² + d³)运行时间。

Conclusion: 这些结果首次在接近最优的扩展机制t ≳ d^(1+δ)下，为SGD迭代构建置信区间提供了完全在线和数据驱动的框架。

Abstract: Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) has become a cornerstone method in modern
data science. However, deploying SGD in high-stakes applications necessitates
rigorous quantification of its inherent uncertainty. In this work, we establish
\emph{non-asymptotic Berry--Esseen bounds} for linear functionals of online
least-squares SGD, thereby providing a Gaussian Central Limit Theorem (CLT) in
a \emph{growing-dimensional regime}. Existing approaches to high-dimensional
inference for projection parameters, such as~\cite{chang2023inference}, rely on
inverting empirical covariance matrices and require at least $t \gtrsim
d^{3/2}$ iterations to achieve finite-sample Berry--Esseen guarantees,
rendering them computationally expensive and restrictive in the allowable
dimensional scaling. In contrast, we show that a CLT holds for SGD iterates
when the number of iterations grows as $t \gtrsim d^{1+\delta}$ for any $\delta
> 0$, significantly extending the dimensional regime permitted by prior works
while improving computational efficiency. The proposed online SGD-based
procedure operates in $\mathcal{O}(td)$ time and requires only $\mathcal{O}(d)$
memory, in contrast to the $\mathcal{O}(td^2 + d^3)$ runtime of
covariance-inversion methods. To render the theory practically applicable, we
further develop an \emph{online variance estimator} for the asymptotic variance
appearing in the CLT and establish \emph{high-probability deviation bounds} for
this estimator. Collectively, these results yield the first fully online and
data-driven framework for constructing confidence intervals for SGD iterates in
the near-optimal scaling regime $t \gtrsim d^{1+\delta}$.

Motivation: 解决物种分布模型中因空间数据偏差导致的性能限制问题，特别是在数据稀缺区域提升模型可靠性。

Conclusion: 贝叶斯深度学习可以大幅提升物种分布模型在数据稀缺位置的可靠性，有助于生态理解和保护工作。

Abstract: Species distribution models (SDMs), which aim to predict species occurrence
based on environmental variables, are widely used to monitor and respond to
biodiversity change. Recent deep learning advances for SDMs have been shown to
perform well on complex and heterogeneous datasets, but their effectiveness
remains limited by spatial biases in the data. In this paper, we revisit deep
SDMs from a Bayesian perspective and introduce BATIS, a novel and practical
framework wherein prior predictions are updated iteratively using limited
observational data. Models must appropriately capture both aleatoric and
epistemic uncertainty to effectively combine fine-grained local insights with
broader ecological patterns. We benchmark an extensive set of uncertainty
quantification approaches on a novel dataset including citizen science
observations from the eBird platform. Our empirical study shows how Bayesian
deep learning approaches can greatly improve the reliability of SDMs in
data-scarce locations, which can contribute to ecological understanding and
conservation efforts.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer模型经常学习脆弱的启发式方法而非通用算法，本文旨在从理论和实证角度解释这一现象，特别关注图连通性这一测试平台。

Method: 使用简化的解耦Transformer架构，理论证明L层模型能处理直径不超过3^L的图，相当于计算邻接矩阵的幂。分析训练动态，研究模型在不同容量图上的学习策略。

Result: 在模型容量范围内的图（直径≤3^L）驱动学习正确的算法解，而超出容量的图则导致学习基于节点度的简单启发式方法。实证表明限制训练数据在模型容量内可使标准和解耦Transformer学习精确算法。

Conclusion: Transformer学习算法的能力受限于模型容量，超出容量限制会导致模型退化为启发式方法而非通用算法。通过适当限制训练数据范围，可以引导模型学习正确的算法解决方案。

Abstract: Transformers often fail to learn generalizable algorithms, instead relying on
brittle heuristics. Using graph connectivity as a testbed, we explain this
phenomenon both theoretically and empirically. We consider a simplified
Transformer architecture, the disentangled Transformer, and prove that an
$L$-layer model has capacity to solve for graphs with diameters up to exactly
$3^L$, implementing an algorithm equivalent to computing powers of the
adjacency matrix. We analyze the training-dynamics, and show that the learned
strategy hinges on whether most training instances are within this model
capacity. Within-capacity graphs (diameter $\leq 3^L$) drive the learning of a
correct algorithmic solution while beyond-capacity graphs drive the learning of
a simple heuristic based on node degrees. Finally, we empirically demonstrate
that restricting training data within a model's capacity leads to both standard
and disentangled transformers learning the exact algorithm rather than the
degree-based heuristic.

TL;DR: CONFEX是一种基于共形预测和混合整数线性规划的不确定性感知反事实解释方法，提供局部覆盖保证和最优性保证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有反事实解释方法往往忽视预测不确定性，缺乏将不确定性以形式化保证机制纳入解释的合理方法，导致解释可能具有误导性或不适用。

Method: 使用共形预测和混合整数线性规划，开发了一种新的局部化CP程序，通过离线树基输入空间划分实现高效的MILP编码。

Result: 在多个基准测试和指标上评估表明，CONFEX的不确定性感知方法能产生更鲁棒和合理的解释。

Conclusion: CONFEX能够生成具有严格预测不确定性和最优性保证的反事实解释，解决了CFX生成违反可交换性的问题。

Abstract: Counterfactual explanations (CFXs) provide human-understandable
justifications for model predictions, enabling actionable recourse and
enhancing interpretability. To be reliable, CFXs must avoid regions of high
predictive uncertainty, where explanations may be misleading or inapplicable.
However, existing methods often neglect uncertainty or lack principled
mechanisms for incorporating it with formal guarantees. We propose CONFEX, a
novel method for generating uncertainty-aware counterfactual explanations using
Conformal Prediction (CP) and Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP). CONFEX
explanations are designed to provide local coverage guarantees, addressing the
issue that CFX generation violates exchangeability. To do so, we develop a
novel localised CP procedure that enjoys an efficient MILP encoding by
leveraging an offline tree-based partitioning of the input space. This way,
CONFEX generates CFXs with rigorous guarantees on both predictive uncertainty
and optimality. We evaluate CONFEX against state-of-the-art methods across
diverse benchmarks and metrics, demonstrating that our uncertainty-aware
approach yields robust and plausible explanations.

Motivation: 扩散模型的多步迭代和复杂网络结构导致计算开销大、生成延迟高，阻碍实时应用。现有加速技术存在适用性有限、训练成本高或质量下降等问题。

Method: 通过识别扩散过程中的内在计算冗余，实现特征级跨步重用和层间调度，形成从静态重用到动态预测的演进趋势。

Conclusion: 该范式将成为实时高效生成AI的关键推动者，为高效生成智能的理论和实践注入新活力，适用于未来多模态和交互式应用。

Abstract: Diffusion Models have become a cornerstone of modern generative AI for their
exceptional generation quality and controllability. However, their inherent
\textit{multi-step iterations} and \textit{complex backbone networks} lead to
prohibitive computational overhead and generation latency, forming a major
bottleneck for real-time applications. Although existing acceleration
techniques have made progress, they still face challenges such as limited
applicability, high training costs, or quality degradation.
  Against this backdrop, \textbf{Diffusion Caching} offers a promising
training-free, architecture-agnostic, and efficient inference paradigm. Its
core mechanism identifies and reuses intrinsic computational redundancies in
the diffusion process. By enabling feature-level cross-step reuse and
inter-layer scheduling, it reduces computation without modifying model
parameters. This paper systematically reviews the theoretical foundations and
evolution of Diffusion Caching and proposes a unified framework for its
classification and analysis.
  Through comparative analysis of representative methods, we show that
Diffusion Caching evolves from \textit{static reuse} to \textit{dynamic
prediction}. This trend enhances caching flexibility across diverse tasks and
enables integration with other acceleration techniques such as sampling
optimization and model distillation, paving the way for a unified, efficient
inference framework for future multimodal and interactive applications. We
argue that this paradigm will become a key enabler of real-time and efficient
generative AI, injecting new vitality into both theory and practice of
\textit{Efficient Generative Intelligence}.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有最先进的成员推理攻击需要训练大量计算昂贵的参考模型，限制了其实际应用。

Method: 利用训练和测试损失分布的特性，特别是高损失区域异常值的缺失作为风险预测指标，使用简单的损失攻击的真负率来估计模型脆弱性。

Result: 该方法在多种架构和数据集上都能准确估计模型对最先进MIA攻击的脆弱性，且优于低成本和其它分布差异度量方法。

Conclusion: 该方法为评估大型语言模型等复杂模型的隐私风险提供了一种有前景的无参考模型方法。

Abstract: Membership inference attacks (MIAs) have emerged as the standard tool for
evaluating the privacy risks of AI models. However, state-of-the-art attacks
require training numerous, often computationally expensive, reference models,
limiting their practicality. We present a novel approach for estimating
model-level vulnerability, the TPR at low FPR, to membership inference attacks
without requiring reference models. Empirical analysis shows loss distributions
to be asymmetric and heavy-tailed and suggests that most points at risk from
MIAs have moved from the tail (high-loss region) to the head (low-loss region)
of the distribution after training. We leverage this insight to propose a
method to estimate model-level vulnerability from the training and testing
distribution alone: using the absence of outliers from the high-loss region as
a predictor of the risk. We evaluate our method, the TNR of a simple loss
attack, across a wide range of architectures and datasets and show it to
accurately estimate model-level vulnerability to the SOTA MIA attack (LiRA). We
also show our method to outperform both low-cost (few reference models) attacks
such as RMIA and other measures of distribution difference. We finally evaluate
the use of non-linear functions to evaluate risk and show the approach to be
promising to evaluate the risk in large-language models.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为GaLLoP的稀疏微调技术，通过选择梯度幅度大但预训练幅度小的参数进行微调，在保持预训练知识的同时提升下游任务性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 稀疏微调技术的效果依赖于最优选择要微调的模型参数，现有方法在参数选择上存在优化空间。

Method: GaLLoP技术只微调那些在下游任务上梯度幅度最大且预训练幅度最小的模型参数，优先选择任务相关度高但对预训练知识破坏小的参数。

Result: 在LLaMA3 8B和Gemma 2B上的实验表明，GaLLoP在分布内和分布外性能上均优于或匹配其他参数高效微调技术（如LoRA、DoRA、SAFT），并减轻了灾难性遗忘和任务数据记忆问题。

Conclusion: GaLLoP通过选择性地微调关键参数，实现了稳定的性能提升和更好的泛化能力，在大多数随机种子下都能稳健地推广。

Abstract: Sparse fine-tuning techniques adapt LLMs to downstream tasks by only tuning a
sparse subset of model parameters. However, the effectiveness of sparse
adaptation depends on optimally selecting the model parameters to be
fine-tuned. In this work, we introduce a novel sparse fine-tuning technique
named GaLLoP: Gradient-based Sparse Learning on Low-Magnitude Parameters, which
fine-tunes only those model parameters which have the largest gradient
magnitudes on downstream tasks and the smallest pre-trained magnitudes,
intuitively prioritizing parameters that are highly task-relevant, but
minimally disruptive to pre-trained knowledge. Our experimentation with LLaMA3
8B and Gemma 2B as base models shows that GaLLoP consistently improves or
matches the in-distribution as well as out-of-distribution performance obtained
via the usage of other leading parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques,
including LoRA, DoRA, and SAFT. Our analysis demonstrates that GaLLoP mitigates
catastrophic forgetting and memorization of task data, as important pre-trained
parameters remain unchanged, and stabilizes performance relative to other
fine-tuning techniques, robustly generalizing across most random seeds.

Motivation: 数据驱动方法依赖I.I.D.数据假设，但实际应用中环境标签往往不可得，这限制了现有泛化技术的应用。DynaInfer旨在解决由于数据采集挑战、隐私问题和环境变异性导致的环境标签缺失问题。

Method: 通过分析固定神经网络在每轮训练中的预测误差来推断环境规范，实现直接从数据中进行环境分配。该方法解决了无标签场景下的交替优化问题。

Result: 实验表明DynaInfer优于现有环境分配技术，能快速收敛到真实标签，甚至在环境标签可用时也能实现更优性能。

Conclusion: DynaInfer为处理复杂动态系统中的环境差异提供了一种有效的无标签解决方案，在多种动态系统中都表现出色。

Abstract: Data-driven methods offer efficient and robust solutions for analyzing
complex dynamical systems but rely on the assumption of I.I.D. data, driving
the development of generalization techniques for handling environmental
differences. These techniques, however, are limited by their dependence on
environment labels, which are often unavailable during training due to data
acquisition challenges, privacy concerns, and environmental variability,
particularly in large public datasets and privacy-sensitive domains. In
response, we propose DynaInfer, a novel method that infers environment
specifications by analyzing prediction errors from fixed neural networks within
each training round, enabling environment assignments directly from data. We
prove our algorithm effectively solves the alternating optimization problem in
unlabeled scenarios and validate it through extensive experiments across
diverse dynamical systems. Results show that DynaInfer outperforms existing
environment assignment techniques, converges rapidly to true labels, and even
achieves superior performance when environment labels are available.

Motivation: 为了解决模型版权保护问题，即如何证明他人使用了基于自己训练的开源模型，即使对方声称是独立开发的。

Method: 将问题建模为独立性测试，利用语言模型对训练数据顺序的记忆特性，通过相关性分析来检测模型抄袭。在查询设置中直接估计Bob模型对Alice训练数据顺序的似然度；在观察设置中通过文本重叠度或重新训练模型来检测。

Result: 在查询设置中，对40多个Pythia和OLMo微调模型进行测试，大多数情况下p值达到1e-8级别；在观察设置中，第二种方法仅需几百个token就能可靠区分，第一种方法需要几十万个token。

Conclusion: 该方法能有效检测模型抄袭，为开源模型版权保护提供了可行的技术方案，特别是在查询设置下效果显著。

Abstract: Suppose Alice trains an open-weight language model and Bob uses a blackbox
derivative of Alice's model to produce text. Can Alice prove that Bob is using
her model, either by querying Bob's derivative model (query setting) or from
the text alone (observational setting)? We formulate this question as an
independence testing problem--in which the null hypothesis is that Bob's model
or text is independent of Alice's randomized training run--and investigate it
through the lens of palimpsestic memorization in language models: models are
more likely to memorize data seen later in training, so we can test whether Bob
is using Alice's model using test statistics that capture correlation between
Bob's model or text and the ordering of training examples in Alice's training
run. If Alice has randomly shuffled her training data, then any significant
correlation amounts to exactly quantifiable statistical evidence against the
null hypothesis, regardless of the composition of Alice's training data. In the
query setting, we directly estimate (via prompting) the likelihood Bob's model
gives to Alice's training examples and order; we correlate the likelihoods of
over 40 fine-tunes of various Pythia and OLMo base models ranging from 1B to
12B parameters with the base model's training data order, achieving a p-value
on the order of at most 1e-8 in all but six cases. In the observational
setting, we try two approaches based on estimating 1) the likelihood of Bob's
text overlapping with spans of Alice's training examples and 2) the likelihood
of Bob's text with respect to different versions of Alice's model we obtain by
repeating the last phase (e.g., 1%) of her training run on reshuffled data. The
second approach can reliably distinguish Bob's text from as little as a few
hundred tokens; the first does not involve any retraining but requires many
more tokens (several hundred thousand) to achieve high power.

TL;DR: 本文首次从理论上证明，通过梯度下降训练的简化Transformer架构可以在线性分类设置中作为近乎最优的元学习器，仅需少量上下文示例就能适应新任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究Transformer是否能够作为元学习器，仅使用少量上下文示例适应新任务，而无需额外训练。现有的理论分析大多未涉及正式的元学习设置。

Method: 使用简化的Transformer架构，通过梯度下降训练，在线性分类设置中分析其元学习能力。考虑任务家族，每个任务对应类别条件高斯混合模型，均值向量位于共享的k维子空间中。

Result: 训练足够多的任务后，Transformer仅需O(k/R^4)个上下文示例就能泛化到新任务，这几乎匹配了知道共享子空间的最优学习器性能，显著优于仅使用上下文数据的学习器（需要Ω(d/R^4)示例）。

Conclusion: Transformer可以作为有效的元学习器，其训练任务数量和每个任务的示例数量与环境维度d无关，证明了其在元学习中的理论可行性。

Abstract: Transformers have demonstrated impressive in-context learning (ICL)
capabilities, raising the question of whether they can serve as metalearners
that adapt to new tasks using only a small number of in-context examples,
without any further training. While recent theoretical work has studied
transformers' ability to perform ICL, most of these analyses do not address the
formal metalearning setting, where the objective is to solve a collection of
related tasks more efficiently than would be possible by solving each task
individually. In this paper, we provide the first theoretical analysis showing
that a simplified transformer architecture trained via gradient descent can act
as a near-optimal metalearner in a linear classification setting. We consider a
natural family of tasks where each task corresponds to a class-conditional
Gaussian mixture model, with the mean vectors lying in a shared $k$-dimensional
subspace of $R^d$. After training on a sufficient number of such tasks, we show
that the transformer can generalize to a new task using only $O(k / R^4)$
in-context examples, where $R$ denotes the signal strength at test time. This
performance (almost) matches that of an optimal learner that knows exactly the
shared subspace and significantly outperforms any learner that only has access
to the in-context data, which requires $\Omega(d / R^4)$ examples to
generalize. Importantly, our bounds on the number of training tasks and
examples per task needed to achieve this result are independent of the ambient
dimension $d$.

Motivation: 大型语言模型训练的计算需求加剧了全球南方国家与高容量地区之间的结构性不对称，研究旨在探索中等收入国家在硬件、能源和财政约束下建立可持续AI能力的可行路径。

Method: 采用双轴设计，比较不同加速器（NVIDIA H100 vs A100）和训练时长（90天 vs 150天），评估计算需求、能耗、资本支出和监管兼容性。

Result: 所有配置均低于出口管制和电力基础设施阈值，H100方案因硬件效率更高而更具财政可行性，成本为8-14百万美元，A100方案为19-32百万美元。

Conclusion: 延长训练时间应被视为缓解硬件约束的政策工具，使中等收入国家能够生产可用、可审计且本地对齐的模型，建立可持续和战略充足的AI能力。

Abstract: The rapid escalation of computational requirements for training large-scale
language models has reinforced structural asymmetries between high-capacity
jurisdictions and countries in the Global South. This paper examines the
technical and fiscal feasibility of sovereign-scale language model training in
Brazil and Mexico under conditions of constrained hardware access, energy
availability, and fiscal ceilings. Using a dual-axis design that varies
accelerator generation (NVIDIA H100 vs. A100) and training duration (90 vs. 150
days), we estimate compute demand, energy consumption, capital expenditures,
and regulatory compatibility for the training of a 10-trillion-token model. Our
findings show that while all configurations remain below export-control and
electrical infrastructure thresholds, fiscal viability is determined by
hardware efficiency. H100-based scenarios achieve training feasibility at a
total cost of 8-14 million USD, while A100 deployments require 19-32 million
USD due to higher energy and hardware demand. We argue that extending training
timelines should be treated as a policy lever to mitigate hardware constraints,
enabling the production of usable, auditable, and locally aligned models
without competing at the global frontier. This study contributes to the
discourse on AI compute governance and technological sovereignty by
highlighting context-sensitive strategies that allow middle-income countries to
establish sustainable and strategically sufficient AI capabilities.

Abstract: Planning with world models offers a powerful paradigm for robotic control.
Conventional approaches train a model to predict future frames conditioned on
current frames and actions, which can then be used for planning. However, the
objective of predicting future pixels is often at odds with the actual planning
objective; strong pixel reconstruction does not always correlate with good
planning decisions. This paper posits that instead of reconstructing future
frames as pixels, world models only need to predict task-relevant semantic
information about the future. For such prediction the paper poses world
modeling as a visual question answering problem about semantic information in
future frames. This perspective allows world modeling to be approached with the
same tools underlying vision language models. Thus vision language models can
be trained as "semantic" world models through a supervised finetuning process
on image-action-text data, enabling planning for decision-making while
inheriting many of the generalization and robustness properties from the
pretrained vision-language models. The paper demonstrates how such a semantic
world model can be used for policy improvement on open-ended robotics tasks,
leading to significant generalization improvements over typical paradigms of
reconstruction-based action-conditional world modeling. Website available at
