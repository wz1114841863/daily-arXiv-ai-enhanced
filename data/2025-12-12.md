Main category: cs.AR

Abstract: Growing interest in semiconductor workforce development has generated demand for platforms capable of supporting large numbers of independent hardware designs for research and training without imposing high per-project overhead. Traditional multi-project wafer (MPW) services based solely on physical co-placement have historically met this need, yet their scalability breaks down as project counts rise. Recent efforts towards scalable chip tapeouts mitigate these limitations by integrating many small designs within a shared die and attempt to amortize costly resources such as IO pads and memory macros. However, foundational principles for arranging, linking, and validating such densely integrated design sites have received limited systematic investigation. This work presents a new approach with three key techniques to address this gap. First, we establish a structured formulation of the design space that enables automated, algorithm-driven packing of many projects, replacing manual layout practices. Second, we introduce an architecture that exploits only the narrow-area regions between sites to deliver on off-chip communication and other shared needs. Third, we provide a practical approach for on-chip power domains enabling per-project power characterization at a standard laboratory bench and requiring no expertise in low-power ASIC design. Experimental results show that our approach achieves substantial area reductions of up to 13x over state-of-the-art physical-only aggregation methods, offering a scalable and cost-effective path forward for large-scale tapeout environments.

### [2] [A Vertically Integrated Framework for Templatized Chip Design](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10155)
*Jeongeun Kim,Christopher Torng*

Main category: cs.AR

TL;DR: 提出一种从面向对象软件规范生成芯片的方法，通过软件对象与芯片区域的一一映射，降低软件开发者参与芯片设计的门槛


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 软件开发者难以将定制硬件集成到应用中，尽管专用芯片能为机器学习和AI等应用带来显著性能优势。现有芯片设计对软件开发者门槛过高，需要简化设计流程。

Method: 采用模块化构建策略：1）软件对象映射为芯片上的对应区域；2）使用基于序列的形式类型系统检查硬件模块交互是否符合软件模型通信模式；3）开发适合对象对齐设计风格的硬件互连和布局技术。

Result: 实现了从高级面向对象软件规范到芯片设计的映射，保持了软件到芯片设计的思维连续性，使软件开发者能够参与芯片创建，降低了专业知识要求。

Conclusion: 该方法通过软件对象与硬件区域的一一映射、形式化类型系统和专门的布局技术，成功降低了芯片设计的门槛，使软件开发者能够更轻松地利用定制硬件优势。

Abstract: Developers who primarily engage with software often struggle to incorporate custom hardware into their applications, even though specialized silicon can provide substantial benefits to machine learning and AI, as well as to the application domains that they enable. This work investigates how a chip can be generated from a high-level object-oriented software specification, targeting introductory-level chip design learners with only very light performance requirements, while maintaining mental continuity between the chip layout and the software source program. In our approach, each software object is represented as a corresponding region on the die, producing a one-to-one structural mapping that preserves these familiar abstractions throughout the design flow. To support this mapping, we employ a modular construction strategy in which vertically composed IP blocks implement the behavioral protocols expressed in software. A direct syntactic translation, however, cannot meet hardware-level efficiency or communication constraints. For this reason, we leverage formal type systems based on sequences that check whether interactions between hardware modules adhere to the communication patterns described in the software model. We further examine hardware interconnect strategies for composing many such modules and develop layout techniques suited to this object-aligned design style. Together, these contributions preserve mental continuity from software to chip design for new learners and enables practical layout generation, ultimately reducing the expertise required for software developers to participate in chip creation.

Abstract: Neuromorphic computing, inspired by biological neural systems, holds immense promise for ultra-low-power and real-time inference applications. However, limited access to flexible, open-source platforms continues to hinder widespread adoption and experimentation. In this paper, we present a low-cost neuromorphic processor implemented on a Xilinx Zynq-7000 FPGA platform. The processor supports all-to-all configurable connectivity and employs the leaky integrate-and-fire (LIF) neuron model with customizable parameters such as threshold, synaptic weights, and refractory period. Communication with the host system is handled via a UART interface, enabling runtime reconfiguration without hardware resynthesis. The architecture was validated using benchmark datasets including the Iris classification and MNIST digit recognition tasks. Post-synthesis results highlight the design's energy efficiency and scalability, establishing its viability as a research-grade neuromorphic platform that is both accessible and adaptable for real-world spiking neural network applications. This implementation will be released as open source following project completion.

### [4] [SemanticBBV: A Semantic Signature for Cross-Program Knowledge Reuse in Microarchitecture Simulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10231)
*Zhenguo Liu,Chengao Shi,Chen Ding,Jiang Xu*

Main category: cs.AR

TL;DR: SemanticBBV：基于语义的BBV框架，通过两阶段方法生成性能感知的程序签名，支持跨程序模拟重用，实现7143倍加速


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统BBV存在顺序依赖ID和缺乏语义内容的限制，无法实现跨程序知识重用和硬件性能预测，有巨大优化潜力未被开发

Method: 两阶段框架：1) 轻量级RWKV语义编码器将汇编基本块转换为基本块嵌入(BBEs)；2) 顺序不变Set Transformer聚合BBEs，通过三重损失和CPI回归任务联合训练，生成性能敏感签名

Result: 仅模拟14个通用程序点即可估计10个SPEC CPU基准测试性能，平均准确率86.3%，实现7143倍模拟加速；签名对新微架构有强适应性，只需少量微调

Conclusion: SemanticBBV突破了传统BBV的限制，实现了跨程序模拟重用，大幅加速微架构模拟，为性能分析和优化开辟了新途径

Abstract: For decades, sampling-based techniques have been the de facto standard for accelerating microarchitecture simulation, with the Basic Block Vector (BBV) serving as the cornerstone program representation. Yet, the BBV's fundamental limitations: order-dependent IDs that prevent cross-program knowledge reuse and a lack of semantic content predictive of hardware performance have left a massive potential for optimization untapped.
  To address these gaps, we introduce SemanticBBV, a novel, two-stage framework that generates robust, performance-aware signatures for cross-program simulation reuse. First, a lightweight RWKV-based semantic encoder transforms assembly basic blocks into rich Basic Block Embeddings (BBEs), capturing deep functional semantics. Second, an order-invariant Set Transformer aggregates these BBEs, weighted by execution frequency, into a final signature. Crucially, this stage is co-trained with a dual objective: a triplet loss for signature distinctiveness and a Cycles Per Instruction (CPI) regression task, directly imbuing the signature with performance sensitivity. Our evaluation demonstrates that SemanticBBV not only matches traditional BBVs in single-program accuracy but also enables unprecedented cross-program analysis. By simulating just 14 universal program points, we estimated the performance of ten SPEC CPU benchmarks with 86.3% average accuracy, achieving a 7143x simulation speedup. Furthermore, the signature shows strong adaptability to new microarchitectures with minimal fine-tuning.

*Zhiming Liang,Bin Chen,Litao Ye,Chen Sun,Shuo Wang,Zhe Peng*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: 本文提出M-ERC4907扩展方法，解决ERC4907标准在去中心化多时段调度场景中的局限性，支持多时段批量配置和多用户同时授权，显著降低链上交易和Gas消耗。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ERC4907标准仅支持单用户、单时段授权，在去中心化多时段调度场景中适用性和效率严重受限，需要更灵活的授权机制。

Method: 提出M-ERC4907扩展方法，引入支持多时段批量配置和多用户同时授权的新功能，消除ERC4907的严格顺序授权约束。

Result: 在Remix开发平台上的实验结果显示，M-ERC4907方法显著减少了链上交易和总体Gas消耗，提高了可扩展性和资源分配效率。

Conclusion: M-ERC4907方法有效解决了ERC4907在多时段调度中的局限性，通过批量配置和并行授权机制提升了NFT租赁系统的效率和可扩展性。

Abstract: The ERC4907 standard enables rentable Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) but is limited to single-user, single-time-slot authorization, which severely limits its applicability and efficiency in decentralized multi-slot scheduling scenarios. To address this limitation, this paper proposes Multi-slot ERC4907 (M-ERC4907) extension method. The M-ERC4907 method introduces novel functionalities to support the batch configuration of multiple time slots and simultaneous authorization of multiple users, thereby effectively eliminating the rigid sequential authorization constraint of ERC4907. The experiment was conducted on the Remix development platform. Experimental results show that the M-ERC4907 method significantly reduces on-chain transactions and overall Gas consumption, leading to enhanced scalability and resource allocation efficiency.

*Shagnik Pal,Shaizeen Aga,Suchita Pati,Mahzabeen Islam,Lizy K. John*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: FiCCO提出细粒度计算-通信重叠技术，通过比分片级更深层次的细粒度重叠，解锁更广泛的网络拓扑和更细粒度数据流的计算/通信重叠，同时通过启发式方法选择定制化调度方案，实现最高1.6倍加速。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前分布式ML训练和推理中，分片技术普遍存在数据依赖的通信和计算操作，通信暴露导致性能损失高达理想性能的1.7倍。现有工作主要在分片级别进行粗粒度重叠，但存在局限性。

Method: 提出FiCCO细粒度计算-通信重叠技术，在比分片级更深层次进行重叠；分析操作分解导致的效率损失；设计FiCCO调度空间；通过启发式方法根据ML操作特性选择定制化调度；将通信卸载到GPU DMA引擎以减少竞争。

Result: 在现实ML部署场景中，提出的定制化调度方案实现最高1.6倍加速；启发式方法在81%的未见场景中提供准确指导。

Conclusion: FiCCO通过细粒度计算-通信重叠扩展了执行调度设计空间，结合效率损失分析和启发式调度选择，能够有效提升分布式ML系统的性能。

Abstract: As both ML training and inference are increasingly distributed, parallelization techniques that shard (divide) ML model across GPUs of a distributed system, are often deployed. With such techniques, there is a high prevalence of data-dependent communication and computation operations where communication is exposed, leaving as high as 1.7x ideal performance on the table. Prior works harness the fact that ML model state and inputs are already sharded, and employ careful overlap of individual computation/communication shards. While such coarse-grain overlap is promising, in this work, we instead make a case for finer-grain compute-communication overlap which we term FiCCO, where we argue for finer-granularity, one-level deeper overlap than at shard-level, to unlock compute/communication overlap for a wider set of network topologies, finer-grain dataflow and more. We show that FiCCO opens up a wider design space of execution schedules than possible at shard-level alone. At the same time, decomposition of ML operations into smaller operations (done in both shard-based and finer-grain techniques) causes operation-level inefficiency losses. To balance the two, we first present a detailed characterization of these inefficiency losses, then present a design space of FiCCO schedules, and finally overlay the schedules with concomitant inefficiency signatures. Doing so helps us design heuristics that frameworks and runtimes can harness to select bespoke FiCCO schedules based on the nature of underlying ML operations. Finally, to further minimize contention inefficiencies inherent with operation overlap, we offload communication to GPU DMA engines. We evaluate several scenarios from realistic ML deployments and demonstrate that our proposed bespoke schedules deliver up to 1.6x speedup and our heuristics provide accurate guidance in 81% of unseen scenarios.

Abstract: The latency and power consumption of large language models (LLMs) are major constraints when serving them across a wide spectrum of hardware platforms, from mobile edge devices to cloud GPU clusters. Benchmarking is crucial for optimizing efficiency in both model deployment and next-generation model development. To address this need, we open-source a simple profiling tool, \textbf{ELANA}, for evaluating LLMs. ELANA is designed as a lightweight, academic-friendly profiler for analyzing model size, key-value (KV) cache size, prefilling latency (Time-to-first-token, TTFT), generation latency (Time-per-output-token, TPOT), and end-to-end latency (Time-to-last-token, TTLT) of LLMs on both multi-GPU and edge GPU platforms. It supports all publicly available models on Hugging Face and offers a simple command-line interface, along with optional energy consumption logging. Moreover, ELANA is fully compatible with popular Hugging Face APIs and can be easily customized or adapted to compressed or low bit-width models, making it ideal for research on efficient LLMs or for small-scale proof-of-concept studies. We release the ELANA profiling tool at: https://github.com/enyac-group/Elana.

Result: 在包含282个真实AWS访问控制策略的数据集上测试，CloudFix在不同请求规模下均优于基线方法，显著提高了修复准确率，首次展示了LLM在访问控制策略修复中的有效性。

Conclusion: CloudFix是首个利用LLM进行策略修复的框架，证明了LLM在访问控制领域的有效性，能够实现云访问控制策略的高效自动化修复，相关工具和数据集已开源。

Abstract: Access control policies are vital for securing modern cloud computing, where organizations must manage access to sensitive data across thousands of users in distributed system settings. Cloud administrators typically write and update policies manually, which can be an error-prone and time-consuming process and can potentially lead to security vulnerabilities. Existing approaches based on symbolic analysis have demon- strated success in automated debugging and repairing access control policies; however, their generalizability is limited in the context of cloud-based access control. Conversely, Large Language Models (LLMs) have been utilized for automated program repair; however, their applicability to repairing cloud access control policies remains unexplored. In this work, we introduce CloudFix, the first automated policy repair framework for cloud access control that combines formal methods with LLMs. Given an access control policy and a specification of allowed and denied access requests, CloudFix employs Formal Methods-based Fault Localization to identify faulty statements in the policy and leverages LLMs to generate potential repairs, which are then verified using SMT solvers. To evaluate CloudFix, we curated a dataset of 282 real-world AWS access control policies extracted from forum posts and augmented them with synthetically generated request sets based on real scenarios. Our experimental results show that CloudFix improves repair accuracy over a Baseline implementation across varying request sizes. Our work is the first to leverage LLMs for policy repair, showcasing the effectiveness of LLMs for access control and enabling efficient and automated repair of cloud access control policies. We make our tool Cloudfix and AWS dataset publicly available.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Web3.0从中心化向去中心化转型，用户获得数据自主权，但面临冗余数据复制导致的效率问题和数据不一致带来的安全漏洞挑战

Method: 开发TDC-Cache框架，采用两层架构：DON层作为可信中介平台；提出基于深度强化学习的DRL-DC算法动态优化缓存策略；设计PoCL共识机制确保缓存决策一致性

Result: 实验结果显示：相比现有方法，平均访问延迟降低20%，缓存命中率最高提升18%，平均共识成功率提高10%

Conclusion: 本文首次探索Web3.0去中心化缓存框架和策略，TDC-Cache能有效解决效率和安全问题，为Web3.0基础设施提供重要支撑

Abstract: The rapid growth of Web3.0 is transforming the Internet from a centralized structure to decentralized, which empowers users with unprecedented self-sovereignty over their own data. However, in the context of decentralized data access within Web3.0, it is imperative to cope with efficiency concerns caused by the replication of redundant data, as well as security vulnerabilities caused by data inconsistency. To address these challenges, we develop a Trustworthy Decentralized Cooperative Caching (TDC-Cache) framework for Web3.0 to ensure efficient caching and enhance system resilience against adversarial threats. This framework features a two-layer architecture, wherein the Decentralized Oracle Network (DON) layer serves as a trusted intermediary platform for decentralized caching, bridging the contents from decentralized storage and the content requests from users. In light of the complexity of Web3.0 network topologies and data flows, we propose a Deep Reinforcement Learning-Based Decentralized Caching (DRL-DC) for TDC-Cache to dynamically optimize caching strategies of distributed oracles. Furthermore, we develop a Proof of Cooperative Learning (PoCL) consensus to maintain the consistency of decentralized caching decisions within DON. Experimental results show that, compared with existing approaches, the proposed framework reduces average access latency by 20%, increases the cache hit rate by at most 18%, and improves the average success consensus rate by 10%. Overall, this paper serves as a first foray into the investigation of decentralized caching framework and strategy for Web3.0.

Conclusion: GOODSPEED为多用户分布式LLM推理系统提供了一个可扩展、公平且高效的解决方案，通过自适应推测解码优化goodput并确保服务器间的比例公平性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized natural language processing, yet their high computational demands pose significant challenges for real-time inference, especially in multi-user server speculative decoding and resource-constrained environments. Speculative decoding has emerged as a promising technique to accelerate LLM inference by using lightweight draft models to generate candidate tokens, which are subsequently verified by a larger, more accurate model. However, ensuring both high goodput (the effective rate of accepted tokens) and fairness across multiple draft servers cooperating with a central verification server remains an open challenge. This paper introduces GOODSPEED, a novel distributed inference framework that optimizes goodput through adaptive speculative decoding. GOODSPEED employs a central verification server that coordinates a set of heterogeneous draft servers, each running a small language model to generate speculative tokens. To manage resource allocation effectively, GOODSPEED incorporates a gradient scheduling algorithm that dynamically assigns token verification tasks, maximizing a logarithmic utility function to ensure proportional fairness across servers. By processing speculative outputs from all draft servers in parallel, the framework enables efficient collaboration between the verification server and distributed draft generators, streamlining both latency and throughput. Through rigorous fluid sample path analysis, we show that GOODSPEED converges to the optimal goodput allocation in steady-state conditions and maintains near-optimal performance with provably bounded error under dynamic workloads. These results demonstrate that GOODSPEED provides a scalable, fair and efficient solution for multi- in distributed LLM inference systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代云平台面临大规模深度学习工作负载的调度挑战，GPU集群日益异构化且缺乏对应用特性的可见性，现有调度器依赖离线性能分析或特定应用假设，难以有效应对这些挑战。

Method: RLTune采用强化学习驱动的优先级调度与混合整数线性规划（MILP）的作业到节点映射相结合的方法，实现动态的深度学习作业调度。该框架无需针对每个作业进行性能分析，能够适应异构GPU集群环境。

Conclusion: RLTune能够跨不同工作负载进行泛化，无需针对每个作业进行性能分析，为云提供商提供了可大规模部署的高效、公平和可持续的深度学习工作负载管理解决方案。

Abstract: Modern cloud platforms increasingly host large-scale deep learning (DL) workloads, demanding high-throughput, low-latency GPU scheduling. However, the growing heterogeneity of GPU clusters and limited visibility into application characteristics pose major challenges for existing schedulers, which often rely on offline profiling or application-specific assumptions. We present RLTune, an application-agnostic reinforcement learning (RL)-based scheduling framework that dynamically prioritizes and allocates DL jobs on heterogeneous GPU clusters. RLTune integrates RL-driven prioritization with MILP-based job-to-node mapping to optimize system-wide objectives such as job completion time (JCT), queueing delay, and resource utilization. Trained on large-scale production traces from Microsoft Philly, Helios, and Alibaba, RLTune improves GPU utilization by up to 20%, reduces queueing delay by up to 81%, and shortens JCT by as much as 70 percent. Unlike prior approaches, RLTune generalizes across diverse workloads without requiring per-job profiling, making it practical for cloud providers to deploy at scale for more efficient, fair, and sustainable DL workload management.

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: 提出CP-LRCs（级联奇偶校验LRCs），通过将全局奇偶校验块分解到所有局部奇偶校验块中，实现宽条带LRCs中奇偶校验块的协作，显著降低修复时间和带宽。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LRCs在宽条带设置中存在结构限制：增大的局部组增加单节点修复成本，多节点故障频繁触发昂贵的全局修复，可靠性急剧下降。根本原因是局部和全局奇偶校验块独立设计，无法在修复时协作。

Method: 提出CP-LRCs，通过在所有局部奇偶校验块中嵌入全局奇偶校验块的依赖关系，创建级联奇偶校验组。提供通用系数生成框架，开发利用级联特性的修复算法，并实例化为CP-Azure和CP-Uniform两种实现。

Result: 在阿里云上的评估显示，单节点故障修复时间减少高达41%，两节点故障修复时间减少26%，同时保持MDS级别的容错能力。

Conclusion: CP-LRCs通过局部和全局奇偶校验块的协作设计，解决了宽条带LRCs的修复效率问题，显著提升了存储系统的修复性能和可靠性。

Abstract: Erasure coding with wide stripes is increasingly adopted to reduce storage overhead in large-scale storage systems. However, existing Locally Repairable Codes (LRCs) exhibit structural limitations in this setting: inflated local groups increase single-node repair cost, multi-node failures frequently trigger expensive global repair, and reliability degrades sharply. We identify a key root cause: local and global parity blocks are designed independently, preventing them from cooperating during repair. We present Cascaded Parity LRCs (CP-LRCs), a new family of wide stripe LRCs that embed structured dependency between parity blocks by decomposing a global parity block across all local parity blocks. This creates a cascaded parity group that preserves MDS-level fault tolerance while enabling low-bandwidth single-node and multi-node repairs. We provide a general coefficient-generation framework, develop repair algorithms exploiting cascading, and instantiate the design with CP-Azure and CP-Uniform. Evaluations on Alibaba Cloud show reductions in repair time of up to 41% for single-node failures and 26% for two-node failures.

Abstract: Clustered Federated Learning (CFL) has emerged as a powerful approach for addressing data heterogeneity and ensuring privacy in large distributed IoT environments. By clustering clients and training cluster-specific models, CFL enables personalized models tailored to groups of heterogeneous clients. However, conventional CFL approaches suffer from fragmented learning for training independent global models for each cluster and fail to take advantage of collective cluster insights. This paper advocates a shift to hierarchical CFL, allowing bi-level aggregation to train cluster-specific models at the edge and a unified global model at the cloud. This shift improves training efficiency yet might introduce communication challenges. To this end, we propose CFLHKD, a novel personalization scheme for integrating hierarchical cluster knowledge into CFL. Built upon multi-teacher knowledge distillation, CFLHKD enables inter-cluster knowledge sharing while preserving cluster-specific personalization. CFLHKD adopts a bi-level aggregation to bridge the gap between local and global learning. Extensive evaluations of standard benchmark datasets demonstrate that CFLHKD outperforms representative baselines in cluster-specific and global model accuracy and achieves a performance improvement of 3.32-7.57\%.

*Xinhang Chen,Chao Zhang,Jiahuan He,Wei Liu,Jianming Zhang,Wenlong Zhou,Xiao Li,Pai Zeng,Shiyong Li,Yuanpan Qian,Dong Li,Zhaogeng Li*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: ESS系统通过将Latent-Cache卸载到CPU内存，解决了DeepSeek-V3.2-Exp在长上下文推理中的GPU内存瓶颈，显著提升解码阶段吞吐量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DeepSeek-V3.2-Exp虽然通过稀疏注意力机制减少了长上下文推理延迟，但解码阶段的PD解耦仍然是主要瓶颈。瓶颈源于Latent-Cache随序列长度线性增长与GPU内存容量有限之间的矛盾，这限制了批处理大小并抑制了解码阶段吞吐量。

Method: 提出ESS（Extended Sparse Server）系统，这是一种针对DeepSeek-V3.2-Exp的卸载中心化系统设计。ESS选择性地将Latent-Cache卸载到CPU内存，同时将延迟关键组件保留在GPU上。通过释放GPU内存，ESS有效地将批处理大小扩展与GPU内存约束解耦。

Result: 高保真模拟显示，ESS在32K上下文长度下提供69.4%的吞吐量提升，在128K上下文长度下提供高达123%的吞吐量提升，证明了其在大上下文推理工作负载中的有效性。

Conclusion: ESS是长上下文LLM服务的实用且可扩展的解决方案，通过解决GPU内存瓶颈显著提高解码阶段吞吐量，从而降低实际部署成本。

Abstract: DeepSeek-V3.2-Exp introduces a sparse attention mechanism that significantly reduces inference latency in long-context scenarios. Although the overall throughput has improved greatly, the Decode-stage of PD disaggregation remains to be a major bottleneck. This bottleneck primarily stems from the conflict between linear growth of Latent-Cache with sequence length and the limited GPU memory capacity, which constrains the feasible batch-size and thereby suppresses Decode-stage throughput.
  To address this challenge, we propose ESS (Extended Sparse Server), an offload-centric system design tailored for DeepSeek-V3.2-Exp. ESS selectively offloads Latent-Cache to CPU memory while preserving latency-critical components on GPU. By freeing up GPU memory, ESS effectively decoupling batch-size scaling from GPU memory constraints. This design significantly improves Decode-stage throughput, thereby reducing deployment costs in real-world settings.
  Our high-fidelity simulations show that ESS delivers 69.4\% throughput improvement at 32K context length and up to 123\% throughput improvement at 128K, demonstrating its effectiveness for large-context inference workloads. These results highlight ESS as a practical and scalable solution for long-context LLM serving.

### [16] [Design and Implementation of a High-Precision Wind-Estimation UAV with Onboard Sensors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10428)
*Haowen Yu,Na Fan,Xing Liu,Ximin Lyu*

Main category: cs.ET

TL;DR: 提出一种仅使用机载传感器的实时风矢量估计方法，通过扰动观测器估计气动力，薄板样条模型映射到风矢量，风桶增强气动灵敏度，在多种场景下实现高精度风估计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 无人机需要精确的实时风矢量估计来提升安全性、导航精度和能源效率。传统方法依赖外部传感器或简化车辆动力学，在敏捷飞行或资源受限平台上适用性有限。

Method: 1. 使用扰动观测器(DOB)估计外部气动力；2. 通过薄板样条(TPS)模型将气动力映射到风矢量；3. 采用定制设计的"风桶"增强气动灵敏度。

Result: 在风洞、室内外飞行实验中验证：风速RMSE低至0.06 m/s（风洞）、0.22 m/s（室外悬停）、低于0.38 m/s（室内外动态飞行）；风向RMSE低于7.3°；垂直风估计RMSE低于0.17 m/s（室内快速平移），优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: 该方法仅使用机载传感器实现了高精度实时风矢量估计，在受控和真实条件下均表现优异，特别在垂直风估计方面填补了现有方法的空白。

Abstract: Accurate real-time wind vector estimation is essential for enhancing the safety, navigation accuracy, and energy efficiency of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). Traditional approaches rely on external sensors or simplify vehicle dynamics, which limits their applicability during agile flight or in resource-constrained platforms. This paper proposes a real-time wind estimation method based solely on onboard sensors. The approach first estimates external aerodynamic forces using a disturbance observer (DOB), and then maps these forces to wind vectors using a thin-plate spline (TPS) model. A custom-designed wind barrel mounted on the UAV enhances aerodynamic sensitivity, further improving estimation accuracy. The system is validated through comprehensive experiments in wind tunnels, indoor and outdoor flights. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves consistently high-accuracy wind estimation across controlled and real-world conditions, with speed RMSEs as low as \SI{0.06}{m/s} in wind tunnel tests, \SI{0.22}{m/s} during outdoor hover, and below \SI{0.38}{m/s} in indoor and outdoor dynamic flights, and direction RMSEs under \ang{7.3} across all scenarios, outperforming existing baselines. Moreover, the method provides vertical wind estimates -- unavailable in baselines -- with RMSEs below \SI{0.17}{m/s} even during fast indoor translations.

Conclusion: 该分类法不仅具有理论贡献，还支持决策支持系统和数据估值模型的实际应用，推进了建立跨行业一致、动态的数据评估和货币化方法的更广泛目标。

Abstract: Data valuation and monetisation are emerging as central challenges in data-driven economies, yet no unified framework exists to measure or manage data value across organisational contexts. This paper presents a systematic literature review of metrics and key performance indicators (KPIs) relevant to data valuation and monetisation, focusing on the Internal Processes Perspective of the Balanced Scorecard (BSC). As part of a broader effort to explore all four BSC perspectives, we identify, categorise, and interrelate hundreds of metrics within a comprehensive taxonomy structured around three core clusters: Data Quality, Governance & Compliance, and Operational Efficiency. The taxonomy consolidates overlapping definitions, clarifies conceptual dependencies, and links technical, organisational, and regulatory indicators that underpin data value creation. By integrating these dimensions, it provides a foundation for the development of standardised and evidence-based valuation frameworks. Beyond its theoretical contribution, the taxonomy supports ongoing practical applications in decision-support systems and data valuation models, advancing the broader goal of establishing a coherent, dynamic approach to assessing and monetising data across industries.

Abstract: This paper presents the Unified Smart Factory Model (USFM), a comprehensive framework designed to translate high-level sustainability goals into measurable factory-level indicators with a systematic information map of manufacturing activities. The manufacturing activities were modelled as set of manufacturing, assembly and auxiliary processes using Object Process Methodology, a Model Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) language. USFM integrates Manufacturing Process and System, Data Process, and Key Performance Indicator (KPI) Selection and Assessment in a single framework. Through a detailed case study of Printed Circuit Board (PCB) assembly factory, the paper demonstrates how environmental sustainability KPIs can be selected, modelled, and mapped to the necessary data, highlighting energy consumption and environmental impact metrics. The model's systematic approach can reduce redundancy, minimize the risk of missing critical information, and enhance data collection. The paper concluded that the USFM bridges the gap between sustainability goals and practical implementation, providing significant benefits for industries specifically SMEs aiming to achieve sustainability targets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 异构图神经网络在处理大规模图时面临结构冗余和高维节点特征带来的可扩展性挑战，现有基于梯度匹配的图压缩方法主要针对同构图，计算和内存开销大

Method: HGC-Herd采用免训练框架，集成轻量级特征传播编码多跳关系上下文，使用类内聚类机制识别每类的代表性节点，生成平衡且具有判别性的子集

Result: 在ACM、DBLP和Freebase数据集上的实验表明，HGC-Herd在保持与全图训练相当或更优准确率的同时，显著降低了运行时间和内存消耗

Conclusion: HGC-Herd为高效可扩展的异构图表示学习提供了实用价值，能够在保持语义和结构保真度的同时生成紧凑的异构图

Abstract: Heterogeneous graph neural networks (HGNNs) have demonstrated strong capability in modeling complex semantics across multi-type nodes and relations. However, their scalability to large-scale graphs remains challenging due to structural redundancy and high-dimensional node features. Existing graph condensation approaches, such as GCond, are primarily developed for homogeneous graphs and rely on gradient matching, resulting in considerable computational, memory, and optimization overhead. We propose HGC-Herd, a training-free condensation framework that generates compact yet informative heterogeneous graphs while maintaining both semantic and structural fidelity. HGC-Herd integrates lightweight feature propagation to encode multi-hop relational context and employs a class-wise herding mechanism to identify representative nodes per class, producing balanced and discriminative subsets for downstream learning tasks. Extensive experiments on ACM, DBLP, and Freebase validate that HGC-Herd attains comparable or superior accuracy to full-graph training while markedly reducing both runtime and memory consumption. These results underscore its practical value for efficient and scalable heterogeneous graph representation learning.

TL;DR: BAMBO框架通过贝叶斯自适应多目标块级优化，自动构建LLM的帕累托前沿，解决现有方法在能力-效率权衡中的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM合并技术无法有效构建帕累托集：粗粒度模型级方法只能产生稀疏的次优解，而细粒度层级方法面临"维度灾难"，导致搜索空间计算不可行。

Method: 提出BAMBO框架，采用混合最优块划分策略（形式化为1D聚类问题，使用动态规划平衡块内同质性和块间信息分布），在qEHVI采集函数驱动的进化循环中自动优化。

Result: 实验表明BAMBO比基线方法发现更优越、更全面的帕累托前沿，能够根据不同的操作约束进行敏捷的模型选择。

Conclusion: BAMBO成功解决了LLM能力-效率权衡中的帕累托集构建问题，通过智能块划分降低维度同时保持关键粒度，实现了高效的自动化优化。

Abstract: Constructing a Pareto set is pivotal for navigating the capability-efficiency trade-offs in Large Language Models (LLMs); however, existing merging techniques remain inadequate for this task. Coarse-grained, model-level methods yield only a sparse set of suboptimal solutions, while fine-grained, layer-wise approaches suffer from the "curse of dimensionality," rendering the search space computationally intractable. To resolve this dichotomy, we propose BAMBO (Bayesian Adaptive Multi-objective Block-wise Optimization), a novel framework that automatically constructs the LLM Pareto set. BAMBO renders the search tractable by introducing a Hybrid Optimal Block Partitioning strategy. Formulated as a 1D clustering problem, this strategy leverages a dynamic programming approach to optimally balance intra-block homogeneity and inter-block information distribution, thereby dramatically reducing dimensionality without sacrificing critical granularity. The entire process is automated within an evolutionary loop driven by the q-Expected Hypervolume Improvement (qEHVI) acquisition function. Experiments demonstrate that BAMBO discovers a superior and more comprehensive Pareto frontier than baselines, enabling agile model selection tailored to diverse operational constraints.

TL;DR: 提出一种潜在动作世界模型，通过联合使用动作条件数据和无动作数据，学习共享的潜在动作表示，从而在少量动作标注样本下实现高效的世界模型学习。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统世界模型依赖动作条件轨迹，当动作标签稀缺时效果受限。人类能够结合直接交互和无动作经验（如视频），因此需要能够从异构数据中学习的世界模型。

Method: 引入潜在动作世界模型家族，通过将观测到的控制信号与从被动观察推断的动作对齐，学习共享的潜在动作表示。使用单个动力学模型在大规模无标签轨迹上训练，仅需少量动作标注数据。通过离线强化学习学习潜在动作策略。

Result: 在DeepMind Control Suite上，该方法在使用比纯动作条件基线少约一个数量级的动作标注样本情况下，实现了强大的性能。

Conclusion: 潜在动作使世界模型能够在被动和交互数据上训练，提高了学习效率，弥合了离线强化学习和无动作训练这两个传统上分离的领域。

Abstract: Inspired by how humans combine direct interaction with action-free experience (e.g., videos), we study world models that learn from heterogeneous data. Standard world models typically rely on action-conditioned trajectories, which limits effectiveness when action labels are scarce. We introduce a family of latent-action world models that jointly use action-conditioned and action-free data by learning a shared latent action representation. This latent space aligns observed control signals with actions inferred from passive observations, enabling a single dynamics model to train on large-scale unlabeled trajectories while requiring only a small set of action-labeled ones. We use the latent-action world model to learn a latent-action policy through offline reinforcement learning (RL), thereby bridging two traditionally separate domains: offline RL, which typically relies on action-conditioned data, and action-free training, which is rarely used with subsequent RL. On the DeepMind Control Suite, our approach achieves strong performance while using about an order of magnitude fewer action-labeled samples than purely action-conditioned baselines. These results show that latent actions enable training on both passive and interactive data, which makes world models learn more efficiently.

Motivation: 当前因果发现方法在处理高维数据和复杂依赖关系时面临挑战，需要利用系统先验知识来辅助因果发现

Method: 使用Cluster-DAG作为先验知识框架来预热启动因果发现，提出改进的约束型算法Cluster-PC（完全可观测）和Cluster-FCI（部分可观测）

Result: 在模拟数据上的实证评估表明，Cluster-PC和Cluster-FCI在性能上优于没有先验知识的基线方法

Conclusion: Cluster-DAG提供了比现有分层背景知识方法更大的灵活性，能够有效提升因果发现算法的性能

Abstract: Finding cause-effect relationships is of key importance in science. Causal discovery aims to recover a graph from data that succinctly describes these cause-effect relationships. However, current methods face several challenges, especially when dealing with high-dimensional data and complex dependencies. Incorporating prior knowledge about the system can aid causal discovery. In this work, we leverage Cluster-DAGs as a prior knowledge framework to warm-start causal discovery. We show that Cluster-DAGs offer greater flexibility than existing approaches based on tiered background knowledge and introduce two modified constraint-based algorithms, Cluster-PC and Cluster-FCI, for causal discovery in the fully and partially observed setting, respectively. Empirical evaluation on simulated data demonstrates that Cluster-PC and Cluster-FCI outperform their respective baselines without prior knowledge.

TL;DR: HB-SGE是一种结合重球动量和预测梯度外推的鲁棒一阶优化方法，在病态和非凸问题上比NAG和标准动量方法更稳定。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 加速梯度方法（如NAG）在良好条件问题上收敛快，但在病态或非凸问题上容易因动量积累而发散。需要一种既能保持加速效果又能在复杂地形上稳定的方法。

Method: 提出HB-SGE方法，结合重球动量和预测梯度外推。不同于传统动量方法积累历史梯度，HB-SGE使用局部泰勒近似估计未来梯度方向，提供自适应加速同时保持稳定性。

Result: 在病态二次问题（条件数κ=50）上，HB-SGE在119次迭代收敛，而SGD和NAG都发散。在非凸Rosenbrock函数上，HB-SGE在2,718次迭代收敛，而经典动量方法在10步内发散。HB-SGE在强凸函数上有收敛保证。

Conclusion: 虽然NAG在良好条件问题上更快，但HB-SGE提供了鲁棒的替代方案，在多样化地形上比SGD有加速效果，仅需O(d)内存开销，且与标准动量方法使用相同的超参数。

Abstract: Accelerated gradient methods like Nesterov's Accelerated Gradient (NAG) achieve faster convergence on well-conditioned problems but often diverge on ill-conditioned or non-convex landscapes due to aggressive momentum accumulation. We propose Heavy-Ball Synthetic Gradient Extrapolation (HB-SGE), a robust first-order method that combines heavy-ball momentum with predictive gradient extrapolation. Unlike classical momentum methods that accumulate historical gradients, HB-SGE estimates future gradient directions using local Taylor approximations, providing adaptive acceleration while maintaining stability. We prove convergence guarantees for strongly convex functions and demonstrate empirically that HB-SGE prevents divergence on problems where NAG and standard momentum fail. On ill-conditioned quadratics (condition number $κ=50$), HB-SGE converges in 119 iterations while both SGD and NAG diverge. On the non-convex Rosenbrock function, HB-SGE achieves convergence in 2,718 iterations where classical momentum methods diverge within 10 steps. While NAG remains faster on well-conditioned problems, HB-SGE provides a robust alternative with speedup over SGD across diverse landscapes, requiring only $O(d)$ memory overhead and the same hyperparameters as standard momentum.

TL;DR: 本文提出四种新的参考权重设置策略来改进多参考偏好优化(MRPO)，实验发现单参考DPO通常优于多参考方法，对多参考方法的实际价值提出质疑。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前MRPO方法中设置参考权重的策略是临时性的且缺乏统计依据，导致性能不可靠，需要更系统的方法来利用多个参考模型的集体优势。

Method: 提出四种新的权重设置策略：两种离线方法利用验证集信号；一种在线方法使用滑动窗口估计器减少过拟合；另一种在线方法将参考权重设置视为K臂老虎机问题，采用Thompson Sampling。

Result: 在Qwen2.5-0.5B作为策略模型、7个不同家族的参考模型(0.5B-14B)的实验中，所有4种新策略在UltraFeedback和SafeRLHF数据集上的偏好准确率均优于现有MRPO权重方法。但更引人深思的是，使用7个参考中任意6个的单参考DPO方法持续优于所有测试的多参考方法。

Conclusion: 虽然提出的新权重策略改进了MRPO性能，但单参考DPO的优越表现对多参考方法的实际吸引力提出了质疑，需要重新评估多参考方法的实用价值。

Abstract: Fine-tuning is integral for aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences. Multiple-Reference Preference Optimization (MRPO) builds on Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) by fine-tuning LLMs on preference datasets while regularizing the policy towards a mixture of reference models to leverage their collective desirable properties. However, current methods for setting the reference weights are ad-hoc and statistically unsound, leading to unreliable performance. To address this, we introduce four new weighting strategies: two offline methods that leverage held-out validation signal; one online method that uses a sliding-window estimator to reduce overfitting; and an online method that treats reference weighting as a $K$-armed bandit via Thompson Sampling. Experiments using Qwen2.5-0.5B as the policy model and seven reference models from the Llama, Mistral, Qwen, Yi, and Phi families (0.5B-14B each) show that all 4 of our strategies outperform the current MRPO weighting methods on UltraFeedback and SafeRLHF in preference accuracy. More thought-provokingly, however, we find that single-reference DPO, using any of 6 out of 7 references, consistently outperforms all tested multiple-reference approaches -- calling into question the practical appeal of multiple-reference approaches.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在无监督强化学习预训练中，智能体需要在没有任务特定奖励函数的情况下学习下游任务的先验策略。状态熵最大化（SEM）旨在学习最大化状态平稳分布熵的策略，但现有方法存在局限性。

Method: 提出SEMDICE算法，一种原则性的离策略方法，直接从任意离策略数据集中计算SEM策略。该方法在平稳分布空间中直接优化策略，计算单一、平稳的马尔可夫状态熵最大化策略。

Result: 实验结果表明，SEMDICE在最大化状态熵方面优于基线算法，同时在基于SEM的无监督RL预训练方法中实现了最佳的下游任务适应效率。

Conclusion: SEMDICE是一种有效的无监督预训练方法，能够从任意离策略数据集中学习状态熵最大化策略，为下游任务提供良好的先验知识。

Abstract: In the unsupervised pre-training for reinforcement learning, the agent aims to learn a prior policy for downstream tasks without relying on task-specific reward functions. We focus on state entropy maximization (SEM), where the goal is to learn a policy that maximizes the entropy of the state stationary distribution. In this paper, we introduce SEMDICE, a principled off-policy algorithm that computes an SEM policy from an arbitrary off-policy dataset, which optimizes the policy directly within the space of stationary distributions. SEMDICE computes a single, stationary Markov state-entropy-maximizing policy from an arbitrary off-policy dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that SEMDICE outperforms baseline algorithms in maximizing state entropy while achieving the best adaptation efficiency for downstream tasks among SEM-based unsupervised RL pre-training methods.

TL;DR: 提出一种用于葡萄牙语零样本命名实体识别的三步集成方法，通过组合多个本地运行的小型LLM，在多数数据集上超越单个模型性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM在NLP任务中表现出色，但在命名实体识别（NER）方面表现不佳，特别是对于葡萄牙语等低资源语言。虽然开源LLM支持本地部署，但没有单一模型在所有任务上占优，这促使需要集成方法。现有LLM集成主要关注文本生成或分类，NER领域研究不足。

Method: 提出新颖的三步集成流程：1）使用启发式方法选择最优模型组合；2）利用少量标注数据；3）在零样本设置下组合多个本地运行的小型LLM。该方法不需要对当前任务进行微调。

Result: 在五个葡萄牙语NER数据集中，该方法在四个数据集上超越了单个LLM的性能。此外，在不同源数据集上获得的集成模型在跨数据集配置中通常优于单个LLM，可能消除了对当前任务标注数据的需求。

Conclusion: 该工作通过有效组合多个小型LLM而不需要微调，推进了可扩展、低资源和零样本NER的发展。代码已开源，为低资源语言的NER任务提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in many Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks through in-context learning but often under-perform in Named Entity Recognition (NER), especially for lower-resource languages like Portuguese. While open-weight LLMs enable local deployment, no single model dominates all tasks, motivating ensemble approaches. However, existing LLM ensembles focus on text generation or classification, leaving NER under-explored. In this context, this work proposes a novel three-step ensemble pipeline for zero-shot NER using similarly capable, locally run LLMs. Our method outperforms individual LLMs in four out of five Portuguese NER datasets by leveraging a heuristic to select optimal model combinations with minimal annotated data. Moreover, we show that ensembles obtained on different source datasets generally outperform individual LLMs in cross-dataset configurations, potentially eliminating the need for annotated data for the current task. Our work advances scalable, low-resource, and zero-shot NER by effectively combining multiple small LLMs without fine-tuning. Code is available at https://github.com/Joao-Luz/local-llm-ner-ensemble.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM)-driven agents are emerging as a powerful new paradigm for solving complex problems. Despite the empirical success of these practices, a theoretical framework to understand and unify their macroscopic dynamics remains lacking. This Letter proposes a method based on the least action principle to estimate the underlying generative directionality of LLMs embedded within agents. By experimentally measuring the transition probabilities between LLM-generated states, we statistically discover a detailed balance in LLM-generated transitions, indicating that LLM generation may not be achieved by generally learning rule sets and strategies, but rather by implicitly learning a class of underlying potential functions that may transcend different LLM architectures and prompt templates. To our knowledge, this is the first discovery of a macroscopic physical law in LLM generative dynamics that does not depend on specific model details. This work is an attempt to establish a macroscopic dynamics theory of complex AI systems, aiming to elevate the study of AI agents from a collection of engineering practices to a science built on effective measurements that are predictable and quantifiable.

TL;DR: 提出DB2-TransF架构，用可学习的Daubechies小波系数层替代自注意力机制，在保持预测精度的同时显著降低计算复杂度


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer在时间序列预测中能有效捕捉长程依赖，但其二次计算复杂度限制了可扩展性和适应性，需要更高效的架构

Method: 设计基于Daubechies小波系数的可学习层替代自注意力机制，该小波模块能有效捕捉多尺度局部和全局模式，增强多时间序列间的相关性建模

Result: 在13个标准预测基准测试中，DB2-TransF达到与传统Transformer相当或更优的预测精度，同时显著减少内存使用

Conclusion: DB2-TransF为时间序列预测提供了一个可扩展且资源高效的高级框架，平衡了预测精度和计算效率

Abstract: Time series forecasting requires models that can efficiently capture complex temporal dependencies, especially in large-scale and high-dimensional settings. While Transformer-based architectures excel at modeling long-range dependencies, their quadratic computational complexity poses limitations on scalability and adaptability. To overcome these challenges, we introduce DB2-TransF, a novel Transformer-inspired architecture that replaces the self-attention mechanism with a learnable Daubechies wavelet coefficient layer. This wavelet-based module efficiently captures multi-scale local and global patterns and enhances the modeling of correlations across multiple time series for the time series forecasting task. Extensive experiments on 13 standard forecasting benchmarks demonstrate that DB2-TransF achieves comparable or superior predictive accuracy to conventional Transformers, while substantially reducing memory usage for the time series forecasting task. The obtained experimental results position DB2-TransF as a scalable and resource-efficient framework for advanced time series forecasting.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SoTra方法通过传播连续概率分布来缓解暴露偏差，实现校准的不确定性感知轨迹预测，结合风险感知解码最小化临床风险，在血糖和血压预测中分别降低18%和15%的风险。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自回归预测在糖尿病和血流动力学管理中至关重要，但标准模型使用教师强制训练会遭受暴露偏差，导致闭环使用时多步预测不稳定，无法满足不同临床风险区域的需求。

Method: 提出Soft-Token Trajectory Forecasting (SoTra)方法，通过传播连续概率分布（软标记）来缓解暴露偏差，学习校准的不确定性感知轨迹，并引入风险感知解码模块最小化预期临床危害。

Result: 在血糖预测中，SoTra将平均区域风险降低18%；在血压预测中，将有效临床风险降低约15%，支持其在安全关键预测控制中的应用。

Conclusion: SoTra方法通过缓解暴露偏差和整合风险感知解码，显著改善了临床风险预测，为安全关键医疗应用中的预测控制提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Autoregressive forecasting is central to predictive control in diabetes and hemodynamic management, where different operating zones carry different clinical risks. Standard models trained with teacher forcing suffer from exposure bias, yielding unstable multi-step forecasts for closed-loop use. We introduce Soft-Token Trajectory Forecasting (SoTra), which propagates continuous probability distributions (``soft tokens'') to mitigate exposure bias and learn calibrated, uncertainty-aware trajectories. A risk-aware decoding module then minimizes expected clinical harm. In glucose forecasting, SoTra reduces average zone-based risk by 18\%; in blood-pressure forecasting, it lowers effective clinical risk by approximately 15\%. These improvements support its use in safety-critical predictive control.

Motivation: 大型语言模型作为零样本分类器虽然有效，但计算需求高、环境成本大，限制了其在高性能计算环境中大规模标注的实用性。需要更可持续的工作流程。

Method: 开发Text2Graph开源框架，结合LLM部分标注和图神经网络标签传播，提供模块化设计，可灵活替换特征提取器、边构建方法和采样策略等组件。

Result: 在5个主题分类和情感分析数据集上的零样本测试表明，基于图的传播方法能以极低的能耗和环境成本获得有竞争力的性能。

Conclusion: Text2Graph框架通过LLM与GNN的结合，在保持分类性能的同时显著降低了计算能耗和碳排放，为可持续的大规模文本标注提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have become effective zero-shot classifiers, but their high computational requirements and environmental costs limit their practicality for large-scale annotation in high-performance computing (HPC) environments. To support more sustainable workflows, we present \textsc{Text2Graph}, an open-source Python package that provides a modular implementation of existing text-to-graph classification approaches. The framework enables users to combine LLM-based partial annotation with Graph Neural Network (GNN) label propagation in a flexible manner, making it straightforward to swap components such as feature extractors, edge construction methods, and sampling strategies. We benchmark \textsc{Text2Graph} on a zero-shot setting using five datasets spanning topic classification and sentiment analysis tasks, comparing multiple variants against other zero-shot approaches for text classification. In addition to reporting performance, we provide detailed estimates of energy consumption and carbon emissions, showing that graph-based propagation achieves competitive results at a fraction of the energy and environmental cost.

TL;DR: MedXAI是一个可解释的医学影像分类框架，通过整合深度学习模型与临床专家知识，提升泛化能力、减少罕见类别偏见，并提供临床可理解的解释，在跨域泛化和罕见类别检测上显著优于基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学AI面临域偏移和罕见类别条件下的准确性和可解释性挑战。深度学习模型在真实世界分布变化中表现不佳，对罕见病理存在偏见，且缺乏临床部署所需的透明度。

Method: 提出MedXAI框架，将深度视觉模型与临床专家知识相结合，通过定位相关诊断特征而非依赖技术性后处理方法（如显著性图、LIME）来提供人类可理解的解释。

Result: 在10个多中心数据集上的实验显示，跨域泛化能力提升3%，罕见类别的F1分数提升10%，显著优于强深度学习基线。消融实验证实符号组件作为有效的临床先验和正则化器，提升了分布偏移下的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: MedXAI在提供临床对齐解释的同时，实现了优越的域内和跨域性能，特别是在多模态医学AI中的罕见疾病诊断方面。

Abstract: Accurate and interpretable image-based diagnosis remains a fundamental challenge in medical AI, particularly un- der domain shifts and rare-class conditions. Deep learning mod- els often struggle with real-world distribution changes, exhibit bias against infrequent pathologies, and lack the transparency required for deployment in safety-critical clinical environments. We introduce MedXAI (An Explainable Framework for Med- ical Imaging Classification), a unified expert knowledge based framework that integrates deep vision models with clinician- derived expert knowledge to improve generalization, reduce rare- class bias, and provide human-understandable explanations by localizing the relevant diagnostic features rather than relying on technical post-hoc methods (e.g., Saliency Maps, LIME). We evaluate MedXAI across heterogeneous modalities on two challenging tasks: (i) Seizure Onset Zone localization from resting-state fMRI, and (ii) Diabetic Retinopathy grading. Ex periments on ten multicenter datasets show consistent gains, including a 3% improvement in cross-domain generalization and a 10% improvmnet in F1 score of rare class, substantially outperforming strong deep learning baselines. Ablations confirm that the symbolic components act as effective clinical priors and regularizers, improving robustness under distribution shift. MedXAI delivers clinically aligned explanations while achieving superior in-domain and cross-domain performance, particularly for rare diseases in multimodal medical AI.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在混合系统（同时具有连续和离散时间动态）学习中，需要学习每个离散模式的动态，这面临模式切换和流不连续性的组合问题，导致学习困难。

Conclusion: CHyLL通过将混合系统重构为连续流形，避免了传统方法中的模式切换和不连续性问题，为混合系统学习提供了更有效和准确的框架。

Abstract: Learning the flows of hybrid systems that have both continuous and discrete time dynamics is challenging. The existing method learns the dynamics in each discrete mode, which suffers from the combination of mode switching and discontinuities in the flows. In this work, we propose CHyLL (Continuous Hybrid System Learning in Latent Space), which learns a continuous neural representation of a hybrid system without trajectory segmentation, event functions, or mode switching. The key insight of CHyLL is that the reset map glues the state space at the guard surface, reformulating the state space as a piecewise smooth quotient manifold where the flow becomes spatially continuous. Building upon these insights and the embedding theorems grounded in differential topology, CHyLL concurrently learns a singularity-free neural embedding in a higher-dimensional space and the continuous flow in it. We showcase that CHyLL can accurately predict the flow of hybrid systems with superior accuracy and identify the topological invariants of the hybrid systems. Finally, we apply CHyLL to the stochastic optimal control problem.

Abstract: Reliable data-driven estimation of Shannon entropy from small data sets, where the number of examples is potentially smaller than the number of possible outcomes, is a critical matter in several applications. In this paper, we introduce a discrete entropy estimator, where we use the decomposability property in combination with estimations of the missing mass and the number of unseen outcomes to compensate for the negative bias induced by them. Experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms some classical estimators in undersampled regimes, and performs comparably with some well-established state-of-the-art estimators.

Abstract: Traditional feature engineering approaches for molecular sequence classification suffer from sparsity issues and computational complexity, while deep learning models often underperform on tabular biological data. This paper introduces a novel topological approach that transforms molecular sequences into images by combining Chaos Game Representation (CGR) with Rips complex construction from algebraic topology. Our method maps sequence elements to 2D coordinates via CGR, computes pairwise distances, and constructs Rips complexes to capture both local structural and global topological features. We provide formal guarantees on representation uniqueness, topological stability, and information preservation. Extensive experiments on anticancer peptide datasets demonstrate superior performance over vector-based, sequence language models, and existing image-based methods, achieving 86.8\% and 94.5\% accuracy on breast and lung cancer datasets, respectively. The topological representation preserves critical sequence information while enabling effective utilization of vision-based deep learning architectures for molecular sequence analysis.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: COVID-19早期检测和特征分析对临床响应和公共卫生规划至关重要。现有方法存在局限性：基于系统发育树的方法计算密集，难以扩展到数百万序列的数据集；现有嵌入方法要么依赖序列比对，要么预测性能不佳且运行成本高，阻碍了大规模实际分析。

Abstract: Early detection and characterization of coronavirus disease (COVID-19), caused by SARS-CoV-2, remain critical for effective clinical response and public-health planning. The global availability of large-scale viral sequence data presents significant opportunities for computational analysis; however, existing approaches face notable limitations. Phylogenetic tree-based methods are computationally intensive and do not scale efficiently to today's multi-million-sequence datasets. Similarly, current embedding-based techniques often rely on aligned sequences or exhibit suboptimal predictive performance and high runtime costs, creating barriers to practical large-scale analysis. In this study, we focus on the most prevalent SARS-CoV-2 lineages associated with the spike protein region and introduce a scalable embedding method that leverages hashing to generate compact, low-dimensional representations of spike sequences. These embeddings are subsequently used to train a variety of machine learning models for supervised lineage classification. We conduct an extensive evaluation comparing our approach with multiple baseline and state-of-the-art biological sequence embedding methods across diverse metrics. Our results demonstrate that the proposed embeddings offer substantial improvements in efficiency, achieving up to 86.4\% classification accuracy while reducing embedding generation time by as much as 99.81\%. This highlights the method's potential as a fast, effective, and scalable solution for large-scale viral sequence analysis.

*Tiago Brogueira,Mário Figueiredo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文主张将因果发现的i.i.d.设置重新框架为更一般的可交换性原理，并创建了仅基于可交换性假设的合成数据集，该数据集比传统i.i.d.数据集更接近真实世界数据特征。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统因果发现方法在i.i.d.和时间序列数据下采用不同的建模假设，作者认为i.i.d.设置应该基于更一般的可交换性原理重新框架，因为真实世界的"i.i.d."基准数据集实际上主要包含可交换而非严格i.i.d.的样本。

Method: 1) 概念论证：将实验因果推断对可交换性的依赖扩展到因果发现；2) 实证论证：分析现有i.i.d.因果发现方法实际依赖可交换性假设，以及Tübingen数据集主要包含可交换样本；3) 创建仅基于可交换性假设的新合成数据集；4) 开发基于神经网络的因果发现算法，仅在新合成数据集上训练。

Result: 1) 新的可交换性合成数据集比所有其他i.i.d.合成数据集更接近真实世界"i.i.d."数据集(Tübingen)的统计结构；2) 仅在新合成数据集上训练的神经网络因果发现算法在真实世界基准测试中表现与最先进的i.i.d.方法相当。

Conclusion: 因果发现的i.i.d.设置应该重新框架为可交换性原理，这为开发更符合真实世界数据特征的因果发现方法提供了理论基础，并展示了仅基于可交换性假设的合成数据集在训练有效因果发现算法方面的潜力。

Abstract: Causal discovery methods have traditionally been developed under two distinct regimes: independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) and timeseries data, each governed by separate modelling assumptions. In this paper, we argue that the i.i.d. setting can and should be reframed in terms of exchangeability, a strictly more general symmetry principle. We present the implications of this reframing, alongside two core arguments: (1) a conceptual argument, based on extending the dependency of experimental causal inference on exchangeability to causal discovery; and (2) an empirical argument, showing that many existing i.i.d. causal-discovery methods are predicated on exchangeability assumptions, and that the sole extensive widely-used real-world "i.i.d." benchmark (the Tübingen dataset) consists mainly of exchangeable (and not i.i.d.) examples. Building on this insight, we introduce a novel synthetic dataset that enforces only the exchangeability assumption, without imposing the stronger i.i.d. assumption. We show that our exchangeable synthetic dataset mirrors the statistical structure of the real-world "i.i.d." dataset more closely than all other i.i.d. synthetic datasets. Furthermore, we demonstrate the predictive capability of this dataset by proposing a neural-network-based causal-discovery algorithm trained exclusively on our synthetic dataset, and which performs similarly to other state-of-the-art i.i.d. methods on the real-world benchmark.

TL;DR: CIEGAD是一个几何感知和领域对齐的数据增强框架，通过聚类条件、插值/外推合成和几何约束过滤，系统性地补充现实数据分布中的语义未覆盖区域，特别适用于长尾和多类分类任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 实际深度学习部署中，数据稀缺和标签分布不平衡导致现实数据分布中存在语义未覆盖区域，这阻碍模型训练，导致类别边界附近的错误分类以及边缘区域的不稳定行为。虽然大语言模型在数据增强方面有潜力，但尚未建立能够同时实现生成方向控制、领域对齐和质量控制的集成框架。

Method: 提出CIEGAD框架：1) 通过聚类条件构建领域配置文件；2) 使用集成类别频率和几何指标的分层频率-几何分配来分配生成；3) 通过插值和外推合成的共存精细控制生成方向；4) 通过几何约束过滤结合LLM-as-a-Judge机制进行质量控制。

Result: 在多个分类任务上的实验表明，CIEGAD能有效扩展现实数据分布的边缘，同时保持生成数据与现实数据的高对齐度以及语义多样性。特别在长尾和多类分类任务中，CIEGAD持续提升F1和召回率，验证了分布一致性、多样性和质量的三重和谐。

Conclusion: CIEGAD作为一个实用导向的数据增强框架，能够补充代表性不足的区域，同时保持与现实数据的对齐，为解决数据稀缺和分布不平衡问题提供了有效方案。

Abstract: In practical deep learning deployment, the scarcity of data and the imbalance of label distributions often lead to semantically uncovered regions within the real-world data distribution, hindering model training and causing misclassification near class boundaries as well as unstable behaviors in peripheral areas. Although recent large language models (LLMs) show promise for data augmentation, an integrated framework that simultaneously achieves directional control of generation, domain alignment, and quality control has not yet been fully established. To address these challenges, we propose a Cluster-conditioned Interpolative and Extrapolative framework for Geometry-Aware and Domain-aligned data augmentation (CIEGAD), which systematically complements both in-distribution and out-of-distribution semantically uncovered regions. CIEGAD constructs domain profiles through cluster conditioning, allocates generation with a hierarchical frequency-geometric allocation integrating class frequency and geometric indicators, and finely controls generation directions via the coexistence of interpolative and extrapolative synthesis. It further performs quality control through geometry-constrained filtering combined with an LLM-as-a-Judge mechanism. Experiments on multiple classification tasks demonstrate that CIEGAD effectively extends the periphery of real-world data distributions while maintaining high alignment between generated and real-world data as well as semantic diversity. In particular, for long-tailed and multi-class classification tasks, CIEGAD consistently improves F1 and recall, validating the triple harmony of distributional consistency, diversity, and quality. These results indicate that CIEGAD serves as a practically oriented data augmentation framework that complements underrepresented regions while preserving alignment with real-world data.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 比较SNN和TCN从HD-sEMG解码指尖力的性能，TCN更准确但SNN作为神经形态基准有改进潜力


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高密度表面肌电图（HD-sEMG）为非侵入式神经接口提供了可能，但将神经活动映射到用户运动意图仍然具有挑战性。需要评估不同神经网络架构在解码指尖力方面的性能。

Method: 使用单个参与者的数据（10次试验），通过两个前臂电极阵列收集HD-sEMG信号。采用FastICA分解获取运动单元（MU）放电活动，使用重叠窗口训练模型，采用端到端的因果卷积架构。比较脉冲神经网络（SNN）和时间卷积网络（TCN）的性能。

Result: 在保留试验中，TCN实现了4.44% MVC的RMSE（Pearson r = 0.974），而SNN实现了8.25% MVC的RMSE（r = 0.922）。TCN在准确性上优于SNN。

Conclusion: 虽然TCN更准确，但SNN作为一个现实的神经形态基准，通过适度的架构和超参数优化可以显著缩小与TCN的性能差距，具有进一步改进的潜力。

Abstract: High-density surface electromyography (HD-sEMG) provides a noninvasive neural interface for assistive and rehabilitation control, but mapping neural activity to user motor intent remains challenging. We assess a spiking neural network (SNN) as a neuromorphic architecture against a temporal convolutional network (TCN) for decoding fingertip force from motor-unit (MU) firing derived from HD-sEMG. Data were collected from a single participant (10 trials) with two forearm electrode arrays; MU activity was obtained via FastICA-based decomposition, and models were trained on overlapping windows with end-to-end causal convolutions. On held-out trials, the TCN achieved 4.44% MVC RMSE (Pearson r = 0.974) while the SNN achieved 8.25% MVC (r = 0.922). While the TCN was more accurate, we view the SNN as a realistic neuromorphic baseline that could close much of this gap with modest architectural and hyperparameter refinements.

Abstract: We present miniF2F-Dafny, the first translation of the mathematical reasoning benchmark miniF2F to an automated theorem prover: Dafny. Previously, the benchmark existed only in interactive theorem provers (Lean, Isabelle, HOL Light, Metamath). We find that Dafny's automation verifies 99/244 (40.6%) of the test set and 109/244 (44.7%) of the validation set with empty proofs--requiring no manual proof steps. For problems where empty proofs fail, we evaluate 12 off-the-shelf LLMs on providing proof hints. The best model we test achieves 55.7% pass@4 success rate employing iterative error correction. These preliminary results highlight an effective division of labor: LLMs provide high-level guidance while automation handles low-level details.

TL;DR: 提出LRTC-TIDT模型，通过时间等距延迟嵌入变换构建Hankel张量，利用时间序列的平滑性和周期性自然诱导低秩性，解决非随机缺失多维时间序列的精确恢复问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 非随机缺失数据是多维时间序列中普遍存在但处理不足的问题，严重威胁数据驱动分析和决策的可靠性。传统的低秩张量补全方法在处理非随机缺失时存在方法和理论上的不足，而现有的Hankel结构方法缺乏明确的低秩性来源理论支撑。

Method: 提出时间等距延迟嵌入变换，构建Hankel张量，其低秩性由底层时间序列的平滑性和周期性自然诱导。在此基础上开发LRTC-TIDT模型，在张量奇异值分解框架下刻画低秩结构。

Result: 在满足规定的非随机采样条件和温和的不相干假设下，LRTC-TIDT模型能够实现精确恢复。在各种非随机缺失模式下的仿真实验验证了该理论。在实际应用中，包括网络流量重建、城市交通估计和温度场预测等任务中，LRTC-TIDT始终优于现有的基于张量的方法。

Conclusion: LRTC-TIDT模型通过时间等距延迟嵌入变换为Hankel张量提供了明确的低秩性来源，并建立了非随机缺失数据下的精确恢复理论，为多维时间序列的非随机缺失问题提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Non-random missing data is a ubiquitous yet undertreated flaw in multidimensional time series, fundamentally threatening the reliability of data-driven analysis and decision-making. Pure low-rank tensor completion, as a classical data recovery method, falls short in handling non-random missingness, both methodologically and theoretically. Hankel-structured tensor completion models provide a feasible approach for recovering multidimensional time series with non-random missing patterns. However, most Hankel-based multidimensional data recovery methods both suffer from unclear sources of Hankel tensor low-rankness and lack an exact recovery theory for non-random missing data. To address these issues, we propose the temporal isometric delay-embedding transform, which constructs a Hankel tensor whose low-rankness is naturally induced by the smoothness and periodicity of the underlying time series. Leveraging this property, we develop the \textit{Low-Rank Tensor Completion with Temporal Isometric Delay-embedding Transform} (LRTC-TIDT) model, which characterizes the low-rank structure under the \textit{Tensor Singular Value Decomposition} (t-SVD) framework. Once the prescribed non-random sampling conditions and mild incoherence assumptions are satisfied, the proposed LRTC-TIDT model achieves exact recovery, as confirmed by simulation experiments under various non-random missing patterns. Furthermore, LRTC-TIDT consistently outperforms existing tensor-based methods across multiple real-world tasks, including network flow reconstruction, urban traffic estimation, and temperature field prediction. Our implementation is publicly available at https://github.com/HaoShu2000/LRTC-TIDT.

Abstract: Federated domain generalization (FedDG) addresses distribution shifts among clients in a federated learning framework. FedDG methods aggregate the parameters of locally trained client models to form a global model that generalizes to unseen clients while preserving data privacy. While improving the generalization capability of the global model, many existing approaches in FedDG jeopardize privacy by sharing statistics of client data between themselves. Our solution addresses this problem by contributing new ways to perform local client training and model aggregation. To improve local client training, we enforce (domain) invariance across local models with the help of a novel technique, \textbf{latent space inversion}, which enables better client privacy. When clients are not \emph{i.i.d}, aggregating their local models may discard certain local adaptations. To overcome this, we propose an \textbf{important weight} aggregation strategy to prioritize parameters that significantly influence predictions of local models during aggregation. Our extensive experiments show that our approach achieves superior results over state-of-the-art methods with less communication overhead.

TL;DR: 提出自适应信息路由（AIR）框架，通过文本数据动态指导时间序列模型，改进多模态时间序列预测准确性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统时间序列预测仅依赖历史数据，信息有限导致预测准确性不足。多模态方法结合文本数据可提供额外信息，但现有方法将文本数据与时间序列数据同等对待，未能充分利用文本信息来指导时间序列模型的动态行为。

Method: 提出自适应信息路由（AIR）框架，利用文本信息动态控制多元时间序列信息的组合方式和程度。同时开发文本精炼流水线，使用大语言模型将原始文本数据转换为适合多模态预测的形式，并建立基于该流水线的基准测试。

Result: 在原油价格和汇率等真实市场数据上的实验表明，AIR能够有效利用文本输入调节时间序列模型的行为，在各种时间序列预测任务中显著提高预测准确性。

Conclusion: AIR框架通过文本数据动态指导时间序列模型，相比现有方法能更有效地利用多模态信息，显著提升预测性能，为多模态时间序列预测提供了新的有效方法。

Abstract: Time series forecasting is a critical task for artificial intelligence with numerous real-world applications. Traditional approaches primarily rely on historical time series data to predict the future values. However, in practical scenarios, this is often insufficient for accurate predictions due to the limited information available. To address this challenge, multimodal time series forecasting methods which incorporate additional data modalities, mainly text data, alongside time series data have been explored. In this work, we introduce the Adaptive Information Routing (AIR) framework, a novel approach for multimodal time series forecasting. Unlike existing methods that treat text data on par with time series data as interchangeable auxiliary features for forecasting, AIR leverages text information to dynamically guide the time series model by controlling how and to what extent multivariate time series information should be combined. We also present a text-refinement pipeline that employs a large language model to convert raw text data into a form suitable for multimodal forecasting, and we introduce a benchmark that facilitates multimodal forecasting experiments based on this pipeline. Experiment results with the real world market data such as crude oil price and exchange rates demonstrate that AIR effectively modulates the behavior of the time series model using textual inputs, significantly enhancing forecasting accuracy in various time series forecasting tasks.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多输出高斯过程在迁移学习中面临三大挑战：1）源域和目标域输入空间异构导致直接知识转移困难；2）忽略先验知识和物理信息，导致不稳定映射；3）不当的信息共享容易引发负迁移。传统模型无法统一解决这些问题。

Method: 提出双正则化异构高斯过程框架（R²-HGP）：1）可训练先验概率映射模型对齐异构输入域；2）将对齐结果作为潜变量构建多源迁移GP模型；3）将整个结构集成到条件变分自编码器框架中；4）加入物理知识作为正则项；5）对迁移系数施加稀疏惩罚以自适应选择信息源。

Result: 通过大量仿真和实际工程案例验证，R²-HGP在多种评估指标上均优于现有最先进基准方法，表现出一致优越性。

Conclusion: R²-HGP框架有效解决了异构迁移学习中的三大挑战，通过输入域对齐、物理知识整合和自适应源选择，实现了更稳定、更准确的知识转移，避免了负迁移问题。

Abstract: Multi-output Gaussian process (MGP) models have attracted significant attention for their flexibility and uncertainty-quantification capabilities, and have been widely adopted in multi-source transfer learning scenarios due to their ability to capture inter-task correlations. However, they still face several challenges in transfer learning. First, the input spaces of the source and target domains are often heterogeneous, which makes direct knowledge transfer difficult. Second, potential prior knowledge and physical information are typically ignored during heterogeneous transfer, hampering the utilization of domain-specific insights and leading to unstable mappings. Third, inappropriate information sharing among target and sources can easily lead to negative transfer. Traditional models fail to address these issues in a unified way. To overcome these limitations, this paper proposes a Double-Regularized Heterogeneous Gaussian Process framework (R^2-HGP). Specifically, a trainable prior probability mapping model is first proposed to align the heterogeneous input domains. The resulting aligned inputs are treated as latent variables, upon which a multi-source transfer GP model is constructed and the entire structure is integrated into a novel conditional variational autoencoder (CVAE) based framework. Physical insights is further incorporated as a regularization term to ensure that the alignment results adhere to known physical knowledge. Next, within the multi-source transfer GP model, a sparsity penalty is imposed on the transfer coefficients, enabling the model to adaptively select the most informative source outputs and suppress negative transfer. Extensive simulations and real-world engineering case studies validate the effectiveness of our R^2-HGP, demonstrating consistent superiority over state-of-the-art benchmarks across diverse evaluation metrics.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 代理模型在气动设计和优化中需要快速替代昂贵的仿真计算，但传统方法在计算资源受限条件下效率较低。本研究旨在开发一种能在资源受限条件下平衡精度和效率的多保真度气动场预测方法。

Conclusion: KHRONOS及其类似架构在多保真度气动场预测中能够有效平衡精度和效率，特别适用于计算资源受限的应用场景，为气动设计和优化提供了高效的代理模型解决方案。

Abstract: Surrogate models provide fast alternatives to costly aerodynamic simulations and are extremely useful in design and optimization applications. This study proposes the use of a recent kernel-based neural surrogate, KHRONOS. In this work, we blend sparse high-fidelity (HF) data with low-fidelity (LF) information to predict aerodynamic fields under varying constraints in computational resources. Unlike traditional approaches, KHRONOS is built upon variational principles, interpolation theory, and tensor decomposition. These elements provide a mathematical basis for heavy pruning compared to dense neural networks. Using the AirfRANS dataset as a high-fidelity benchmark and NeuralFoil to generate low-fidelity counterparts, this work compares the performance of KHRONOS with three contemporary model architectures: a multilayer perceptron (MLP), a graph neural network (GNN), and a physics-informed neural network (PINN). We consider varying levels of high-fidelity data availability (0%, 10%, and 30%) and increasingly complex geometry parameterizations. These are used to predict the surface pressure coefficient distribution over the airfoil. Results indicate that, whilst all models eventually achieve comparable predictive accuracy, KHRONOS excels in resource-constrained conditions. In this domain, KHRONOS consistently requires orders of magnitude fewer trainable parameters and delivers much faster training and inference than contemporary dense neural networks at comparable accuracy. These findings highlight the potential of KHRONOS and similar architectures to balance accuracy and efficiency in multi-fidelity aerodynamic field prediction.

TL;DR: 开发可解释的处方框架，通过最优策略树为主动脉瓣狭窄患者提供个体化的TAVR或SAVR治疗建议，以最小化5年死亡率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前临床实践中，对于低至中危严重主动脉瓣狭窄患者的治疗选择（SAVR vs TAVR）存在变异性，缺乏能够直接优化长期结果的可解释、个体化治疗推荐模型。

Method: 提出可解释的处方框架，整合预后匹配、反事实结果建模和最优策略树（OPT）。通过预后匹配和样本加权模拟随机化，估计SAVR和TAVR下的反事实死亡率，训练策略模型将患者划分为临床一致的亚组并推荐风险较低的治疗。

Result: 应用OPT建议后，反事实评估显示5年死亡率在Hartford医院降低20.3%，在St. Vincent's医院降低13.8%（相对于实际处方），显示出对未见数据的良好泛化能力。学习到的决策边界与实际临床观察一致。

Conclusion: 该可解释处方框架首次为TAVR vs SAVR提供透明、数据驱动的推荐，在内部和外部队列中均改善了估计的长期结果，同时保持临床相关性，为结构性心脏病精准医学提供了更系统、循证的方法。

Abstract: Background. Treatment selection for low to intermediate risk patients with severe aortic stenosis between surgical (SAVR) and transcatheter (TAVR) aortic valve replacement remains variable in clinical practice, driven by patient heterogeneity and institutional preferences. While existing models predict postprocedural risk, there is a lack of interpretable, individualized treatment recommendations that directly optimize long-term outcomes.
  Methods. We introduce an interpretable prescriptive framework that integrates prognostic matching, counterfactual outcome modeling, and an Optimal Policy Tree (OPT) to recommend the treatment minimizing expected 5-year mortality. Using data from Hartford Hospital and St. Vincent's Hospital, we emulate randomization via prognostic matching and sample weighting and estimate counterfactual mortality under both SAVR and TAVR. The policy model, trained on these counterfactual predictions, partitions patients into clinically coherent subgroups and prescribes the treatment associated with lower estimated risk.
  Findings. If the OPT prescriptions are applied, counterfactual evaluation showed an estimated reduction in 5-year mortality of 20.3\% in Hartford and 13.8\% in St. Vincent's relative to real-life prescriptions, showing promising generalizability to unseen data from a different institution. The learned decision boundaries aligned with real-world outcomes and clinical observations.
  Interpretation. Our interpretable prescriptive framework is, to the best of our knowledge, the first to provide transparent, data-driven recommendations for TAVR versus SAVR that improve estimated long-term outcomes both in an internal and external cohort, while remaining clinically grounded and contributing toward a more systematic and evidence-based approach to precision medicine in structural heart disease.

Abstract: Distributed machine learning systems require strong privacy guarantees, verifiable compliance, and scalable deploy- ment across heterogeneous and multi-cloud environments. This work introduces a cloud-native privacy-preserving architecture that integrates federated learning, differential privacy, zero- knowledge compliance proofs, and adaptive governance powered by reinforcement learning. The framework supports secure model training and inference without centralizing sensitive data, while enabling cryptographically verifiable policy enforcement across institutions and cloud platforms. A full prototype deployed across hybrid Kubernetes clusters demonstrates reduced membership- inference risk, consistent enforcement of formal privacy budgets, and stable model performance under differential privacy. Ex- perimental evaluation across multi-institution workloads shows that the architecture maintains utility with minimal overhead while providing continuous, risk-aware governance. The pro- posed framework establishes a practical foundation for deploying trustworthy and compliant distributed machine learning systems at scale.

Abstract: Agentic systems built on large language models operate through recursive feedback loops, where each output becomes the next input. Yet the geometric behavior of these agentic loops (whether they converge, diverge, or exhibit more complex dynamics) remains poorly understood. This paper introduces a geometric framework for analyzing agentic trajectories in semantic embedding space, treating iterative transformations as discrete dynamical systems. We distinguish the artifact space, where linguistic transformations occur, from the embedding space, where geometric measurements are performed. Because cosine similarity is biased by embedding anisotropy, we introduce an isotonic calibration that eliminates systematic bias and aligns similarities with human semantic judgments while preserving high local stability. This enables rigorous measurement of trajectories, clusters and attractors. Through controlled experiments on singular agentic loops, we identify two fundamental regimes. A contractive rewriting loop converges toward a stable attractor with decreasing dispersion, while an exploratory summarize and negate loop produces unbounded divergence with no cluster formation. These regimes display qualitatively distinct geometric signatures of contraction and expansion. Our results show that prompt design directly governs the dynamical regime of an agentic loop, enabling systematic control of convergence, divergence and trajectory structure in iterative LLM transformations.

Motivation: 现有方法主要关注有球动作（如拦截、抢断），但有效防守往往体现在阻止危险机会发生之前，导致防守球员的真实影响未被充分衡量。

Method: 使用图注意力网络估计每个进攻选项的成功概率和预期价值，以及每个防守球员的责任。通过计算进攻方预期控球价值（EPV）在动作前后的变化，给防守球员分配正负积分。

Conclusion: DEFCON提供了一个全面的框架来量化足球防守贡献，超越了传统的有球动作评估，能够更准确地衡量防守球员的真实影响，并具有多种实际应用价值。

Abstract: Evaluating defensive performance in soccer remains challenging, as effective defending is often expressed not through visible on-ball actions such as interceptions and tackles, but through preventing dangerous opportunities before they arise. Existing approaches have largely focused on valuing on-ball actions, leaving much of defenders' true impact unmeasured. To address this gap, we propose DEFCON (DEFensive CONtribution evaluator), a comprehensive framework that quantifies player-level defensive contributions for every attacking situation in soccer. Leveraging Graph Attention Networks, DEFCON estimates the success probability and expected value of each attacking option, along with each defender's responsibility for stopping it. These components yield an Expected Possession Value (EPV) for the attacking team before and after each action, and DEFCON assigns positive or negative credits to defenders according to whether they reduced or increased the opponent's EPV. Trained on 2023-24 and evaluated on 2024-25 Eredivisie event and tracking data, DEFCON's aggregated player credits exhibit strong positive correlations with market valuations. Finally, we showcase several practical applications, including in-game timelines of defensive contributions, spatial analyses across pitch zones, and pairwise summaries of attacker-defender interactions.

Abstract: Magnetization of a ferromagnetic substance in response to an externally applied magnetic field increases with the strength of the field. This is because at the microscopic level, magnetic moments in certain regions or domains of the substance increasingly align with the applied field, while the amount of misaligned domains decreases. The alignment of such magnetic domains with an applied magnetic field forms the physical basis for the nonlinearity of magnetization. In this paper, the nonlinear function is approximated as a combination of continued fraction of straight lines. The resulting fit is used to interpret the nonlinear behavior in both growing and shrinking magnetic domains. The continued fraction of straight lines used here is an algebraic expression which can be used to estimate parameters using nonlinear regression.

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) underpin critical applications yet remain vulnerable to backdoor attacks, typically reliant on heuristic brute-force methods. Despite significant empirical advancements in backdoor research, the lack of rigorous theoretical analysis limits understanding of underlying mechanisms, constraining attack predictability and adaptability. Therefore, we provide a theoretical analysis targeting backdoor attacks, focusing on how sparse decision boundaries enable disproportionate model manipulation. Based on this finding, we derive a closed-form, ambiguous boundary region, wherein negligible relabeled samples induce substantial misclassification. Influence function analysis further quantifies significant parameter shifts caused by these margin samples, with minimal impact on clean accuracy, formally grounding why such low poison rates suffice for efficacious attacks. Leveraging these insights, we propose Eminence, an explainable and robust black-box backdoor framework with provable theoretical guarantees and inherent stealth properties. Eminence optimizes a universal, visually subtle trigger that strategically exploits vulnerable decision boundaries and effectively achieves robust misclassification with exceptionally low poison rates (< 0.1%, compared to SOTA methods typically requiring > 1%). Comprehensive experiments validate our theoretical discussions and demonstrate the effectiveness of Eminence, confirming an exponential relationship between margin poisoning and adversarial boundary manipulation. Eminence maintains > 90% attack success rate, exhibits negligible clean-accuracy loss, and demonstrates high transferability across diverse models, datasets and scenarios.

Abstract: Modern deep networks operate in a rough, finite-regularity regime where Jacobian-induced operators exhibit heavy-tailed spectra and strong basis drift. In this work, we derive a unified operator-theoretoretic description of neural training dynamics directly from gradient descent. Starting from the exact evolution $\dot e_t = -M(t)e_t$ in function space, we apply Kato perturbation theory to obtain a rigorous system of coupled mode ODEs and show that, after coarse-graining, these dynamics converge to a spectral transport--dissipation PDE \[ \partial_t g + \partial_λ(v g) = -λg + S, \] where $v$ captures eigenbasis drift and $S$ encodes nonlocal spectral coupling.
  We prove that neural training preserves functional regularity, forcing the drift to take an asymptotic power-law form $v(λ,t)\sim -c(t)λ^b$. In the weak-coupling regime -- naturally induced by spectral locality and SGD noise -- the PDE admits self-similar solutions with a resolution frontier, polynomial amplitude growth, and power-law dissipation. This structure yields explicit scaling-law exponents, explains the geometry of double descent, and shows that the effective training time satisfies $τ(t)=t^αL(t)$ for slowly varying $L$.
  Finally, we show that NTK training and feature learning arise as two limits of the same PDE: $v\equiv 0$ recovers lazy dynamics, while $v\neq 0$ produces representation drift. Our results provide a unified spectral framework connecting operator geometry, optimization dynamics, and the universal scaling behavior of modern deep networks.

Conclusion: 为AI模型提供了新颖的行为描述框架，将集成选择重新定义为评估短期信号（置信度预测分数）和中期特征（元认知敏感性）的问题

Abstract: A key aspect of human cognition is metacognition - the ability to assess one's own knowledge and judgment reliability. While deep learning models can express confidence in their predictions, they often suffer from poor calibration, a cognitive bias where expressed confidence does not reflect true competence. Do models truly know what they know? Drawing from human cognitive science, we propose a new framework for evaluating and leveraging AI metacognition. We introduce meta-d', a psychologically-grounded measure of metacognitive sensitivity, to characterise how reliably a model's confidence predicts its own accuracy. We then use this dynamic sensitivity score as context for a bandit-based arbiter that performs test-time model selection, learning which of several expert models to trust for a given task. Our experiments across multiple datasets and deep learning model combinations (including CNNs and VLMs) demonstrate that this metacognitive approach improves joint-inference accuracy over constituent models. This work provides a novel behavioural account of AI models, recasting ensemble selection as a problem of evaluating both short-term signals (confidence prediction scores) and medium-term traits (metacognitive sensitivity).

This study introduces a novel Robust Hybrid Physics-ML framework employing Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) for highly accurate, uncertainty-aware Jw prediction. The core innovation lies in training the GPR on the residual error between the detailed, non-linear FO physical model prediction (Jw_physical) and the experimental water flux (Jw_actual). Crucially, we implement a full UQ methodology by decomposing the total predictive variance (sigma2_total) into model uncertainty (epistemic, from GPR's posterior variance) and input uncertainty (aleatoric, analytically propagated via the Delta method for multi-variate correlated inputs). Leveraging the inherent strength of GPR in low-data regimes, the model, trained on a meagre 120 data points, achieved a state-of-the-art Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) of 0.26% and an R2 of 0.999 on the independent test data, validating a truly robust and reliable surrogate model for advanced FO process optimization and digital twin development.

Result: 在DCOPF case118基准测试中：后处理模式4.27ms/项，最大最优性间隙0.0025%；联合训练模式5.25ms/项，最大最优性间隙0.0008%；相比pandapower求解器加速25倍以上，在给定容差下保持零约束违反

Conclusion: 首次系统地将SKM方法集成到神经网络约束满足中，提供了理论保证和实际性能验证，在保持零约束违反的同时显著提升求解效率

Abstract: Neural network constraint satisfaction is crucial for safety-critical applications such as power system optimization, robotic path planning, and autonomous driving. However, existing constraint satisfaction methods face efficiency-applicability trade-offs, with hard constraint methods suffering from either high computational complexity or restrictive assumptions on constraint structures. The Sampling Kaczmarz-Motzkin (SKM) method is a randomized iterative algorithm for solving large-scale linear inequality systems with favorable convergence properties, but its argmax operations introduce non-differentiability, posing challenges for neural network applications. This work proposes the Trainable Sampling Kaczmarz-Motzkin Network (T-SKM-Net) framework and, for the first time, systematically integrates SKM-type methods into neural network constraint satisfaction. The framework transforms mixed constraint problems into pure inequality problems through null space transformation, employs SKM for iterative solving, and maps solutions back to the original constraint space, efficiently handling both equality and inequality constraints. We provide theoretical proof of post-processing effectiveness in expectation and end-to-end trainability guarantees based on unbiased gradient estimators, demonstrating that despite non-differentiable operations, the framework supports standard backpropagation. On the DCOPF case118 benchmark, our method achieves 4.27ms/item GPU serial forward inference with 0.0025% max optimality gap with post-processing mode and 5.25ms/item with 0.0008% max optimality gap with joint training mode, delivering over 25$\times$ speedup compared to the pandapower solver while maintaining zero constraint violations under given tolerance.

Abstract: Robust adversarial reinforcement learning has emerged as an effective paradigm for training agents to handle uncertain disturbance in real environments, with critical applications in sequential decision-making domains such as autonomous driving and robotic control. Within this paradigm, agent training is typically formulated as a zero-sum Markov game between a protagonist and an adversary to enhance policy robustness. However, the trainable nature of the adversary inevitably induces non-stationarity in the learning dynamics, leading to exacerbated training instability and convergence difficulties, particularly in high-dimensional complex environments. In this paper, we propose a novel approach, Uncertainty-Aware Critic Ensemble for robust adversarial Reinforcement learning (UACER), which consists of two strategies: 1) Diversified critic ensemble: a diverse set of K critic networks is exploited in parallel to stabilize Q-value estimation rather than conventional single-critic architectures for both variance reduction and robustness enhancement. 2) Time-varying Decay Uncertainty (TDU) mechanism: advancing beyond simple linear combinations, we develop a variance-derived Q-value aggregation strategy that explicitly incorporates epistemic uncertainty to dynamically regulate the exploration-exploitation trade-off while simultaneously stabilizing the training process. Comprehensive experiments across several MuJoCo control problems validate the superior effectiveness of UACER, outperforming state-of-the-art methods in terms of overall performance, stability, and efficiency.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出自适应回放缓冲区（ARB），通过动态优先采样基于"策略一致性"的数据，解决离线到在线强化学习中固定数据混合比例导致的早期稳定性与渐进性能之间的权衡问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 离线到在线强化学习面临关键困境：如何在固定离线数据集和新收集的在线经验之间取得平衡。标准方法通常依赖固定的数据混合比例，难以在早期学习稳定性和渐进性能之间进行有效权衡。

Method: 提出自适应回放缓冲区（ARB），这是一种基于轻量级"策略一致性"指标动态优先采样数据的方法。ARB无需复杂学习过程，易于实现，可无缝集成到现有O2O RL算法中。它评估收集的轨迹与当前策略行为的接近程度，并为该轨迹中的每个转移分配相应的采样权重。

Result: 在D4RL基准测试上的广泛实验表明，ARB能够持续缓解早期性能下降，并显著提高各种O2O RL算法的最终性能。

Conclusion: 自适应、行为感知的回放缓冲区设计对于离线到在线强化学习至关重要，ARB通过动态数据优先采样有效平衡了离线数据的稳定性和在线经验的相关性。

Abstract: Offline-to-Online Reinforcement Learning (O2O RL) faces a critical dilemma in balancing the use of a fixed offline dataset with newly collected online experiences. Standard methods, often relying on a fixed data-mixing ratio, struggle to manage the trade-off between early learning stability and asymptotic performance. To overcome this, we introduce the Adaptive Replay Buffer (ARB), a novel approach that dynamically prioritizes data sampling based on a lightweight metric we call 'on-policyness'. Unlike prior methods that rely on complex learning procedures or fixed ratios, ARB is designed to be learning-free and simple to implement, seamlessly integrating into existing O2O RL algorithms. It assesses how closely collected trajectories align with the current policy's behavior and assigns a proportional sampling weight to each transition within that trajectory. This strategy effectively leverages offline data for initial stability while progressively focusing learning on the most relevant, high-rewarding online experiences. Our extensive experiments on D4RL benchmarks demonstrate that ARB consistently mitigates early performance degradation and significantly improves the final performance of various O2O RL algorithms, highlighting the importance of an adaptive, behavior-aware replay buffer design.

Conclusion: DDE框架成功解决了在资源受限设备上部署解耦OOD推理器的问题，通过蒸馏压缩模型同时保持解耦特性，具有理论保证和实际应用价值

Abstract: Recently, the disentangled latent space of a variational autoencoder (VAE) has been used to reason about multi-label out-of-distribution (OOD) test samples that are derived from different distributions than training samples. Disentangled latent space means having one-to-many maps between latent dimensions and generative factors or important characteristics of an image. This paper proposes a disentangled distilled encoder (DDE) framework to decrease the OOD reasoner size for deployment on resource-constrained devices while preserving disentanglement. DDE formalizes student-teacher distillation for model compression as a constrained optimization problem while preserving disentanglement with disentanglement constraints. Theoretical guarantees for disentanglement during distillation based on Rademacher complexity are established. The approach is evaluated empirically by deploying the compressed model on an NVIDIA

Conclusion: VML-MAP为逆问题求解提供高效准确的MAP估计方法，无需任务特定训练，在计算效率和性能上均有优势

Abstract: A pre-trained unconditional diffusion model, combined with posterior sampling or maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimation techniques, can solve arbitrary inverse problems without task-specific training or fine-tuning. However, existing posterior sampling and MAP estimation methods often rely on modeling approximations and can be computationally demanding. In this work, we propose the variational mode-seeking loss (VML), which, when minimized during each reverse diffusion step, guides the generated sample towards the MAP estimate. VML arises from a novel perspective of minimizing the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between the diffusion posterior $p(\mathbf{x}_0|\mathbf{x}_t)$ and the measurement posterior $p(\mathbf{x}_0|\mathbf{y})$, where $\mathbf{y}$ denotes the measurement. Importantly, for linear inverse problems, VML can be analytically derived and need not be approximated. Based on further theoretical insights, we propose VML-MAP, an empirically effective algorithm for solving inverse problems, and validate its efficacy over existing methods in both performance and computational time, through extensive experiments on diverse image-restoration tasks across multiple datasets.

Motivation: KV缓存是长上下文大语言模型的主要内存瓶颈，但通常被视为不透明的数值张量。作者希望将KV缓存分解为可解释的语义原子，以弥合机制可解释性与忠实注意力建模之间的差距。

Method: 提出STA-Attention框架，使用Top-K稀疏自编码器分解KV缓存，避免标准L1正则化SAE的收缩偏差。发现Key-Value不对称性：Key向量作为稀疏路由器，Value向量携带密集内容负载。基于此提出双预算策略，选择性保留信息量最大的语义成分。

Result: 在Yi-6B、Mistral-7B、Qwen2.5-32B等模型上的实验表明，语义重建保持了与原始模型相当的困惑度和零样本性能，有效弥合了机制可解释性与注意力建模之间的差距。

Conclusion: STA-Attention框架成功将KV缓存分解为可解释的语义原子，通过双预算策略优化内存使用，为长上下文LLM的KV缓存效率提升提供了新思路，同时保持了模型性能。

Abstract: The Key-Value (KV) cache is the primary memory bottleneck in long-context Large Language Models, yet it is typically treated as an opaque numerical tensor. In this work, we propose \textbf{STA-Attention}, a framework that utilizes Top-K Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) to decompose the KV cache into interpretable ``semantic atoms.'' Unlike standard $L_1$-regularized SAEs, our Top-K approach eliminates shrinkage bias, preserving the precise dot-product geometry required for attention. Our analysis uncovers a fundamental \textbf{Key-Value Asymmetry}: while Key vectors serve as highly sparse routers dominated by a ``Semantic Elbow,'' deep Value vectors carry dense content payloads requiring a larger budget. Based on this structure, we introduce a Dual-Budget Strategy that selectively preserves the most informative semantic components while filtering representational noise. Experiments on Yi-6B, Mistral-7B, Qwen2.5-32B, and others show that our semantic reconstructions maintain perplexity and zero-shot performance comparable to the original models, effectively bridging the gap between mechanistic interpretability and faithful attention modeling.

Conclusion: LaT-IB通过理论推导和实验验证，成功解决了信息瓶颈方法对标签噪声的脆弱性问题，为现实世界中的噪声标签场景提供了有效的表示学习解决方案。

Abstract: The Information Bottleneck (IB) principle facilitates effective representation learning by preserving label-relevant information while compressing irrelevant information. However, its strong reliance on accurate labels makes it inherently vulnerable to label noise, prevalent in real-world scenarios, resulting in significant performance degradation and overfitting. To address this issue, we propose LaT-IB, a novel Label-Noise ResistanT Information Bottleneck method which introduces a "Minimal-Sufficient-Clean" (MSC) criterion. Instantiated as a mutual information regularizer to retain task-relevant information while discarding noise, MSC addresses standard IB's vulnerability to noisy label supervision. To achieve this, LaT-IB employs a noise-aware latent disentanglement that decomposes the latent representation into components aligned with to the clean label space and the noise space. Theoretically, we first derive mutual information bounds for each component of our objective including prediction, compression, and disentanglement, and moreover prove that optimizing it encourages representations invariant to input noise and separates clean and noisy label information. Furthermore, we design a three-phase training framework: Warmup, Knowledge Injection and Robust Training, to progressively guide the model toward noise-resistant representations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LaT-IB achieves superior robustness and efficiency under label noise, significantly enhancing robustness and applicability in real-world scenarios with label noise.

Abstract: Heterogeneous Graph Neural Networks (HGNNs) are effective for modeling Heterogeneous Information Networks (HINs), which encode complex multi-typed entities and relations. However, HGNNs often suffer from type information loss and structural noise, limiting their representational fidelity and generalization. We propose THeGAU, a model-agnostic framework that combines a type-aware graph autoencoder with guided graph augmentation to improve node classification. THeGAU reconstructs schema-valid edges as an auxiliary task to preserve node-type semantics and introduces a decoder-driven augmentation mechanism to selectively refine noisy structures. This joint design enhances robustness, accuracy, and efficiency while significantly reducing computational overhead. Extensive experiments on three benchmark HIN datasets (IMDB, ACM, and DBLP) demonstrate that THeGAU consistently outperforms existing HGNN methods, achieving state-of-the-art performance across multiple backbones.

Abstract: This thesis develops theoretical frameworks and algorithms that advance constrained reinforcement learning (RL) across control, preference learning, and alignment of large language models. The first contribution addresses constrained Markov Decision Processes (CMDPs) under the average-cost criterion through the Average-Constrained Policy Optimization (ACPO) algorithm. ACPO integrates sensitivity analysis with trust-region updates to ensure stable constraint handling, achieving state-of-the-art empirical performance with theoretical guarantees. Constrained RL is then extended to finite-horizon settings via e-COP, the first policy optimization method for episodic CMDPs. Built on an episodic policy difference lemma, e-COP offers provable performance, simplicity, and scalability in safety-critical environments. The thesis then investigates reinforcement learning from human preferences. warmPref-PS introduces a posterior sampling strategy for linear bandits that integrates offline preference data from heterogeneous raters into online learning. Explicit modeling of rater competence yields substantial regret reduction and more efficient data collection for RLHF. The PSPL algorithm further advances preference-based RL by jointly sampling reward models and transition dynamics from pairwise trajectory comparisons, providing Bayesian simple-regret guarantees and robust empirical identification of optimal policies. The final contribution applies these methods to large-scale model alignment. A multi-objective constrained optimization view yields MOPO, an iterative algorithm with closed-form updates that scales to multi-billion-parameter language models and remains robust across alignment settings. Collectively, the thesis unifies constrained RL across average-cost, episodic, and preference-driven paradigms, delivering theoretical advances and practical tools for safe and aligned decision-making.

Abstract: Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs) provide principled uncertainty quantification but suffer from substantial computational and memory overhead compared to deterministic networks. While quantization techniques have successfully reduced resource requirements in standard deep learning models, their application to probabilistic models remains largely unexplored. We introduce a systematic multi-level quantization framework for Stochastic Variational Inference based BNNs that distinguishes between three quantization strategies: Variational Parameter Quantization (VPQ), Sampled Parameter Quantization (SPQ), and Joint Quantization (JQ). Our logarithmic quantization for variance parameters, and specialized activation functions to preserve the distributional structure are essential for calibrated uncertainty estimation. Through comprehensive experiments on Dirty-MNIST, we demonstrate that BNNs can be quantized down to 4-bit precision while maintaining both classification accuracy and uncertainty disentanglement. At 4 bits, Joint Quantization achieves up to 8x memory reduction compared to floating-point implementations with minimal degradation in epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty estimation. These results enable deployment of BNNs on resource-constrained edge devices and provide design guidelines for future analog "Bayesian Machines" operating at inherently low precision.

Abstract: This paper presents a mixed-methodology to forecast illegal border crossings in Europe across five key migratory routes, with a one-year time horizon. The methodology integrates machine learning techniques with qualitative insights from migration experts. This approach aims at improving the predictive capacity of data-driven models through the inclusion of a human-assessed covariate, an innovation that addresses challenges posed by sudden shifts in migration patterns and limitations in traditional datasets. The proposed methodology responds directly to the forecasting needs outlined in the EU Pact on Migration and Asylum, supporting the Asylum and Migration Management Regulation (AMMR). It is designed to provide policy-relevant forecasts that inform strategic decisions, early warning systems, and solidarity mechanisms among EU Member States. By joining data-driven modeling with expert judgment, this work aligns with existing academic recommendations and introduces a novel operational tool tailored for EU migration governance. The methodology is tested and validated with known data to demonstrate its applicability and reliability in migration-related policy context.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型上下文窗口不断扩大，需要研究注意力机制在极端序列长度下的行为特征，特别是注意力如何随着token数量增加而收敛到其无限token极限。

Method: 引入token-sample复杂度概念，从两个层面分析收敛性：1) 注意力图的逐点一致收敛；2) 变换后token分布矩的收敛。针对紧支撑分布和亚高斯分布，推导有限token数下的收敛界。同时研究了注意力参数趋于无穷时softmax接近hardmax的情况。

Result: 对于紧支撑分布，注意力图在半径为R的球上以C(R)/√n速率一致收敛，其中C(R)随R指数增长。对于变换后token分布的矩，收敛速率为C'(R)/n^β（β<1/2），C'(R)与分布支撑大小呈多项式关系。在softmax接近hardmax的极限情况下，收敛速率为对数级。在合成高斯数据和真实BERT模型上的实验验证了理论预测。

Conclusion: 该研究为理解注意力机制在长序列下的行为提供了理论框架，揭示了注意力收敛速率与分布特性、注意力几何结构的关系，对设计更高效的长上下文模型具有指导意义。

Abstract: As context windows in large language models continue to expand, it is essential to characterize how attention behaves at extreme sequence lengths. We introduce token-sample complexity: the rate at which attention computed on $n$ tokens converges to its infinite-token limit. We estimate finite-$n$ convergence bounds at two levels: pointwise uniform convergence of the attention map, and convergence of moments for the transformed token distribution. For compactly supported (and more generally sub-Gaussian) distributions, our first result shows that the attention map converges uniformly on a ball of radius $R$ at rate $C(R)/\sqrt{n}$, where $C(R)$ grows exponentially with $R$. For large $R$, this estimate loses practical value, and our second result addresses this issue by establishing convergence rates for the moments of the transformed distribution (the token output of the attention layer). In this case, the rate is $C'(R)/n^β$ with $β<\tfrac{1}{2}$, and $C'(R)$ depends polynomially on the size of the support of the distribution. The exponent $β$ depends on the attention geometry and the spectral properties of the tokens distribution. We also examine the regime in which the attention parameter tends to infinity and the softmax approaches a hardmax, and in this setting, we establish a logarithmic rate of convergence. Experiments on synthetic Gaussian data and real BERT models on Wikipedia text confirm our predictions.

Abstract: Outlier detection identifies data points that significantly deviate from the majority of the data distribution. Explaining outliers is crucial for understanding the underlying factors that contribute to their detection, validating their significance, and identifying potential biases or errors. Effective explanations provide actionable insights, facilitating preventive measures to avoid similar outliers in the future. Counterfactual explanations clarify why specific data points are classified as outliers by identifying minimal changes required to alter their prediction. Although valuable, most existing counterfactual explanation methods overlook the unique challenges posed by outlier detection, and fail to target classical, widely adopted outlier detection algorithms. Local Outlier Factor (LOF) is one the most popular unsupervised outlier detection methods, quantifying outlierness through relative local density. Despite LOF's widespread use across diverse applications, it lacks interpretability. To address this limitation, we introduce Density-based Counterfactuals for Outliers (DCFO), a novel method specifically designed to generate counterfactual explanations for LOF. DCFO partitions the data space into regions where LOF behaves smoothly, enabling efficient gradient-based optimisation. Extensive experimental validation on 50 OpenML datasets demonstrates that DCFO consistently outperforms benchmarked competitors, offering superior proximity and validity of generated counterfactuals.

Abstract: Compositional generalization -- the ability to understand and generate novel combinations of learned concepts -- enables models to extend their capabilities beyond limited experiences. While effective, the data structures and principles that enable this crucial capability remain poorly understood. We propose that compositional generalization fundamentally requires decomposing high-level concepts into basic, low-level concepts that can be recombined across similar contexts, similar to how humans draw analogies between concepts. For example, someone who has never seen a peacock eating rice can envision this scene by relating it to their previous observations of a chicken eating rice.
  In this work, we formalize these intuitive processes using principles of causal modularity and minimal changes. We introduce a hierarchical data-generating process that naturally encodes different levels of concepts and their interaction mechanisms. Theoretically, we demonstrate that this approach enables compositional generalization supporting complex relations between composed concepts, advancing beyond prior work that assumes simpler interactions like additive effects. Critically, we also prove that this latent hierarchical structure is provably recoverable (identifiable) from observable data like text-image pairs, a necessary step for learning such a generative process. To validate our theory, we apply insights from our theoretical framework and achieve significant improvements on benchmark datasets.

Abstract: Vertical Federated Learning (VFL) offers a privacy-preserving paradigm for Edge AI scenarios like mobile health diagnostics, where sensitive multimodal data reside on distributed, resource-constrained devices. Yet, standard VFL systems often suffer performance limitations due to simplistic feature fusion. This paper introduces HybridVFL, a novel framework designed to overcome this bottleneck by employing client-side feature disentanglement paired with a server-side cross-modal transformer for context-aware fusion. Through systematic evaluation on the multimodal HAM10000 skin lesion dataset, we demonstrate that HybridVFL significantly outperforms standard federated baselines, validating the criticality of advanced fusion mechanisms in robust, privacy-preserving systems.

TL;DR: 基于因果最小化原则，为深度生成模型建立可解释的理论基础，通过稀疏/压缩约束实现潜在变量的因果识别和分层概念提取，实现细粒度模型控制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前深度生成模型（如扩散模型和自回归语言模型）虽然取得了显著成功，但通常作为黑箱运行，缺乏可解释性、可控性和对齐保证。现有方法如稀疏自编码器（SAEs）虽有经验成功，但缺乏理论保证，可能导致主观见解。

Conclusion: 因果最小化原则为深度生成模型提供了可解释的理论基础，使潜在表示具有清晰的因果解释和组件级可识别控制。这种方法为构建透明、可靠的AI系统开辟了新途径，实现了模型内部知识的可解释提取和细粒度操控。

Abstract: Deep generative models, while revolutionizing fields like image and text generation, largely operate as opaque black boxes, hindering human understanding, control, and alignment. While methods like sparse autoencoders (SAEs) show remarkable empirical success, they often lack theoretical guarantees, risking subjective insights. Our primary objective is to establish a principled foundation for interpretable generative models. We demonstrate that the principle of causal minimality -- favoring the simplest causal explanation -- can endow the latent representations of diffusion vision and autoregressive language models with clear causal interpretation and robust, component-wise identifiable control. We introduce a novel theoretical framework for hierarchical selection models, where higher-level concepts emerge from the constrained composition of lower-level variables, better capturing the complex dependencies in data generation. Under theoretically derived minimality conditions (manifesting as sparsity or compression constraints), we show that learned representations can be equivalent to the true latent variables of the data-generating process. Empirically, applying these constraints to leading generative models allows us to extract their innate hierarchical concept graphs, offering fresh insights into their internal knowledge organization. Furthermore, these causally grounded concepts serve as levers for fine-grained model steering, paving the way for transparent, reliable systems.

Abstract: Neural operators offer powerful approaches for solving parametric partial differential equations, but extending them to spherical domains remains challenging due to the need to preserve intrinsic geometry while avoiding distortions that break rotational consistency. Existing spherical operators rely on rotational equivariance but often lack the flexibility for real-world complexity. We propose a general operator-design framework based on the designable spherical Green's function and its harmonic expansion, establishing a solid operator-theoretic foundation for spherical learning. Based on this, we propose an absolute and relative position-dependent Green's function that enables flexible balance of equivariance and invariance for real-world modeling. The resulting operator, Green's-function Spherical Neural Operator (GSNO) with a novel spectral learning method, can adapt to anisotropic, constraint-rich systems while retaining spectral efficiency. To exploit GSNO, we develop GSHNet, a hierarchical architecture that combines multi-scale spectral modeling with spherical up-down sampling, enhancing global feature representation. Evaluations on diffusion MRI, shallow water dynamics, and global weather forecasting, GSNO and GSHNet consistently outperform state-of-the-art methods. Our results position GSNO as a principled and general framework for spherical operator learning, bridging rigorous theory with real-world complexity.

TL;DR: LGAN是一种基于线图的高阶图神经网络，通过构建以每个节点为中心的诱导子图的线图进行聚合，在保持较低计算复杂度的同时超越了2-WL的表达能力，并提供了更好的可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有GNN主要依赖邻居节点间的消息传递，表达能力受限于1-WL测试。虽然k-WL-based GNN可以克服这一限制，但计算成本随k快速增加，且无法保留节点或边级别的细粒度语义，导致可解释性差。

Method: 提出Line Graph Aggregation Network (LGAN)，为每个节点构建以其为中心的诱导子图的线图，在线图上执行高阶聚合。该方法在单射聚合假设下具有比2-WL更强的表达能力，同时时间复杂度更低。

Result: 在基准测试中，LGAN优于最先进的k-WL-based GNN，同时提供了更好的可解释性。理论证明LGAN不仅表达能力超过2-WL，而且具有更低的时间复杂度。

Conclusion: LGAN通过线图聚合策略有效解决了现有k-WL-based GNN的计算成本高和可解释性差的问题，在保持高效计算的同时实现了更强的表达能力和更好的可解释性。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as a dominant paradigm for graph classification. Specifically, most existing GNNs mainly rely on the message passing strategy between neighbor nodes, where the expressivity is limited by the 1-dimensional Weisfeiler-Lehman (1-WL) test. Although a number of k-WL-based GNNs have been proposed to overcome this limitation, their computational cost increases rapidly with k, significantly restricting the practical applicability. Moreover, since the k-WL models mainly operate on node tuples, these k-WL-based GNNs cannot retain fine-grained node- or edge-level semantics required by attribution methods (e.g., Integrated Gradients), leading to the less interpretable problem. To overcome the above shortcomings, in this paper, we propose a novel Line Graph Aggregation Network (LGAN), that constructs a line graph from the induced subgraph centered at each node to perform the higher-order aggregation. We theoretically prove that the LGAN not only possesses the greater expressive power than the 2-WL under injective aggregation assumptions, but also has lower time complexity. Empirical evaluations on benchmarks demonstrate that the LGAN outperforms state-of-the-art k-WL-based GNNs, while offering better interpretability.

Abstract: Retrosynthesis reaction prediction seeks to infer plausible reactant molecules for a given product and is a central problem in computer-aided organic synthesis. Despite recent progress, many existing models still fall short of the accuracy and robustness required for practical deployment. This work studies a template-free, Transformer-based framework that eliminates reliance on handcrafted reaction templates or additional chemical rule engines. The model injects molecular graph information into the attention mechanism to jointly exploit \SMILES\ sequences and structural cues, and further applies a paired data augmentation strategy to enhance training diversity and scale. On the USPTO-50K benchmark, our proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art performance among template-free methods and substantially outperforming a vanilla Transformer baseline.

Motivation: 现有稀疏自编码器（SAE）存在两个主要问题：1）大多数神经元解释性或可控性低，难以实际应用；2）无监督学习导致用户需要的概念往往不在学习到的字典中，限制了实用价值。

Method: 提出概念瓶颈稀疏自编码器（CB-SAE）：1）剪枝低效用神经元；2）在潜在空间中添加轻量级概念瓶颈层，与用户定义的概念集对齐。

Result: CB-SAE在LVLMs和图像生成任务中，解释性提升32.1%，可控性提升14.5%。

Conclusion: CB-SAE通过后处理框架有效解决了SAE的局限性，为LLMs和LVLMs的机制解释性、概念发现和模型控制提供了更实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) promise a unified approach for mechanistic interpretability, concept discovery, and model steering in LLMs and LVLMs. However, realizing this potential requires that the learned features be both interpretable and steerable. To that end, we introduce two new computationally inexpensive interpretability and steerability metrics and conduct a systematic analysis on LVLMs. Our analysis uncovers two observations; (i) a majority of SAE neurons exhibit either low interpretability or low steerability or both, rendering them ineffective for downstream use; and (ii) due to the unsupervised nature of SAEs, user-desired concepts are often absent in the learned dictionary, thus limiting their practical utility. To address these limitations, we propose Concept Bottleneck Sparse Autoencoders (CB-SAE) - a novel post-hoc framework that prunes low-utility neurons and augments the latent space with a lightweight concept bottleneck aligned to a user-defined concept set. The resulting CB-SAE improves interpretability by +32.1% and steerability by +14.5% across LVLMs and image generation tasks. We will make our code and model weights available.

Result: 使用NB2E编码后，普通MLP成功外推了多种周期信号，无需事先知道函数形式；内部激活分析显示NB2E诱导了位相表示

Conclusion: 二进制编码为神经网络外推周期函数提供了有效方法，NB2E通过位相表示使MLP能够独立于位置学习和外推信号结构

Abstract: We report the discovery that binary encoding allows neural networks to extrapolate periodic functions beyond their training bounds. We introduce Normalized Base-2 Encoding (NB2E) as a method for encoding continuous numerical values and demonstrate that, using this input encoding, vanilla multi-layer perceptrons (MLP) successfully extrapolate diverse periodic signals without prior knowledge of their functional form. Internal activation analysis reveals that NB2E induces bit-phase representations, enabling MLPs to learn and extrapolate signal structure independently of position.

Abstract: This paper introduces a reinforcement learning framework that enables controllable and diverse player behaviors without relying on human gameplay data. Existing approaches often require large-scale player trajectories, train separate models for different player types, or provide no direct mapping between interpretable behavioral parameters and the learned policy, limiting their scalability and controllability. We define player behavior in an N-dimensional continuous space and uniformly sample target behavior vectors from a region that encompasses the subset representing real human styles. During training, each agent receives both its current and target behavior vectors as input, and the reward is based on the normalized reduction in distance between them. This allows the policy to learn how actions influence behavioral statistics, enabling smooth control over attributes such as aggressiveness, mobility, and cooperativeness. A single PPO-based multi-agent policy can reproduce new or unseen play styles without retraining. Experiments conducted in a custom multi-player Unity game show that the proposed framework produces significantly greater behavioral diversity than a win-only baseline and reliably matches specified behavior vectors across diverse targets. The method offers a scalable solution for automated playtesting, game balancing, human-like behavior simulation, and replacing disconnected players in online games.

Conclusion: 该方法为科学发现和工程设计中更稳健的符号回归铺平了道路，通过贝叶斯框架提供了鲁棒性和不确定性量化能力。

Abstract: Symbolic regression is a powerful tool for discovering governing equations directly from data, but its sensitivity to noise hinders its broader application. This paper introduces a Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) framework for Bayesian symbolic regression that approximates the posterior distribution over symbolic expressions, enhancing robustness and enabling uncertainty quantification for symbolic regression in the presence of noise. Differing from traditional genetic programming approaches, the SMC-based algorithm combines probabilistic selection, adaptive tempering, and the use of normalized marginal likelihood to efficiently explore the search space of symbolic expressions, yielding parsimonious expressions with improved generalization. When compared to standard genetic programming baselines, the proposed method better deals with challenging, noisy benchmark datasets. The reduced tendency to overfit and enhanced ability to discover accurate and interpretable equations paves the way for more robust symbolic regression in scientific discovery and engineering design applications.

Abstract: Transport-based methods have emerged as a leading paradigm for building generative models from large, clean datasets. However, in many scientific and engineering domains, clean data are often unavailable: instead, we only observe measurements corrupted through a noisy, ill-conditioned channel. A generative model for the original data thus requires solving an inverse problem at the level of distributions. In this work, we introduce a novel approach to this task based on Stochastic Interpolants: we iteratively update a transport map between corrupted and clean data samples using only access to the corrupted dataset as well as black box access to the corruption channel. Under appropriate conditions, this iterative procedure converges towards a self-consistent transport map that effectively inverts the corruption channel, thus enabling a generative model for the clean data. We refer to the resulting method as the self-consistent stochastic interpolant (SCSI). It (i) is computationally efficient compared to variational alternatives, (ii) highly flexible, handling arbitrary nonlinear forward models with only black-box access, and (iii) enjoys theoretical guarantees. We demonstrate superior performance on inverse problems in natural image processing and scientific reconstruction, and establish convergence guarantees of the scheme under appropriate assumptions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代LLM预训练消耗大量计算资源和训练数据，不同模型的缩放规律成为关键区分因素。离散扩散语言模型作为自回归语言模型的替代方案，其缩放行为尚未充分探索，先前研究表明DLMs需要更多数据和计算才能达到ALMs的性能水平。

Method: 通过平滑插值掩码扩散和均匀扩散来研究不同噪声类型的DLMs缩放行为，重点关注批量大小和学习率等关键超参数。实验在计算约束和数据约束两种设置下进行，最终将均匀扩散模型扩展到100亿参数规模。

Result: DLMs的缩放行为强烈依赖于噪声类型，与ALMs显著不同。所有噪声类型在计算约束缩放中收敛到相似的损失值，但均匀扩散在计算效率训练中需要更多参数和更少数据，在数据受限场景下表现更优。成功训练了100亿参数的均匀扩散模型，验证了预测的缩放规律。

Conclusion: DLMs的缩放行为与噪声类型密切相关，均匀扩散在数据受限场景下是更有前景的选择。研究通过大规模实验验证了缩放规律，为未来扩散语言模型的发展提供了重要参考。

Abstract: Modern LLM pre-training consumes vast amounts of compute and training data, making the scaling behavior, or scaling laws, of different models a key distinguishing factor. Discrete diffusion language models (DLMs) have been proposed as an alternative to autoregressive language models (ALMs). However, their scaling behavior has not yet been fully explored, with prior work suggesting that they require more data and compute to match the performance of ALMs.
  We study the scaling behavior of DLMs on different noise types by smoothly interpolating between masked and uniform diffusion while paying close attention to crucial hyperparameters such as batch size and learning rate. Our experiments reveal that the scaling behavior of DLMs strongly depends on the noise type and is considerably different from ALMs. While all noise types converge to similar loss values in compute-bound scaling, we find that uniform diffusion requires more parameters and less data for compute-efficient training compared to masked diffusion, making them a promising candidate in data-bound settings. We scale our uniform diffusion model up to 10B parameters trained for $10^{22}$ FLOPs, confirming the predicted scaling behavior and making it the largest publicly known uniform diffusion model to date.

Results show that linear baselines (Linear, NLinear, DLinear) consistently outperform more complex Transformer-family architectures, with DLinear achieving the best overall accuracy across all splits. These findings highlight that carefully designed linear models remain strong baselines for time series forecasting in challenging exogenous-only settings.

Abstract: Discrete diffusion models achieve strong performance across language and other discrete domains, providing a powerful alternative to autoregressive models. However, their strong performance relies on large training datasets, which are costly or risky to obtain, especially when adapting to new domains. Transfer learning is the natural way to adapt pretrained discrete diffusion models, but current methods require fine-tuning large diffusion models, which is computationally expensive and often impractical. Building on ratio-based transfer learning for continuous diffusion, we provide Guided Transfer Learning for discrete diffusion models (GTL). This enables sampling from a target distribution without modifying the pretrained denoiser. The same guidance formulation applies to both discrete-time diffusion and continuous-time score-based discrete diffusion, yielding a unified treatment. Guided discrete diffusion often requires many forward passes of the guidance network, which becomes impractical for large vocabularies and long sequences. To address this, we further present an efficient guided sampler that concentrates evaluations on planner-selected positions and top candidate tokens, thus lowering sampling time and computation. This makes guided language modeling practical at scale for large vocabularies and long sequences. We evaluate GTL on sequential data, including synthetic Markov chains and language modeling, and provide empirical analyses of its behavior.

Abstract: Counterfactual explanations provide actionable insights by identifying minimal input changes required to achieve a desired model prediction. Beyond their interpretability benefits, counterfactuals can also be leveraged for model reconstruction, where a surrogate model is trained to replicate the behavior of a target model. In this work, we demonstrate that model reconstruction can be significantly improved by recognizing that counterfactuals, which typically lie close to the decision boundary, can serve as informative though less representative samples for both classes. This is particularly beneficial in settings with limited access to labeled data. We propose a method that integrates original data samples with counterfactuals to approximate class prototypes using the Wasserstein barycenter, thereby preserving the underlying distributional structure of each class. This approach enhances the quality of the surrogate model and mitigates the issue of decision boundary shift, which commonly arises when counterfactuals are naively treated as ordinary training instances. Empirical results across multiple datasets show that our method improves fidelity between the surrogate and target models, validating its effectiveness.

*Stefan Matthes,Markus Schramm*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出一个物理信息学习框架，利用夜间均质化期间的数据，从常规运行数据中推断抛物槽式CSP电站的回路质量流量比和随时间变化的接收器传热系数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 抛物槽式CSP电站的大型液压收集器回路网络需要提供均匀的出口温度，但存在空间异质的光学性能、热损失和压降问题。回路温度可测量，但回路级质量流量和接收器热损失参数无法观测，导致无法使用标准监测工具诊断液压不平衡或接收器退化。

Method: 利用夜间均质化期间（热油在非辐照场中循环）来隔离液压和热损失效应。将可微分的共轭传热模型离散化，并嵌入端到端学习管道中，使用Andasol 3太阳能电站的历史数据进行优化。

Result: 模型准确重建回路温度（RMSE <2°C），产生物理上有意义的回路不平衡和接收器热损失估计。与基于无人机的红外热成像（QScan）对比显示强相关性，正确识别了所有高损失接收器区域。

Conclusion: 嘈杂的真实世界CSP运行数据包含足够信息来恢复潜在物理参数，前提是结合适当的建模和可微分优化。该方法为CSP电站的液压不平衡和接收器退化诊断提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Parabolic trough Concentrating Solar Power (CSP) plants operate large hydraulic networks of collector loops that must deliver a uniform outlet temperature despite spatially heterogeneous optical performance, heat losses, and pressure drops. While loop temperatures are measured, loop-level mass flows and receiver heat-loss parameters are unobserved, making it impossible to diagnose hydraulic imbalances or receiver degradation using standard monitoring tools.
  We present a physics-informed learning framework that infers (i) loop-level mass-flow ratios and (ii) time-varying receiver heat-transfer coefficients directly from routine operational data. The method exploits nocturnal homogenization periods -- when hot oil is circulated through a non-irradiated field -- to isolate hydraulic and thermal-loss effects. A differentiable conjugate heat-transfer model is discretized and embedded into an end-to-end learning pipeline optimized using historical plant data from the 50 MW Andasol 3 solar field.
  The model accurately reconstructs loop temperatures (RMSE $<2^\circ$C) and produces physically meaningful estimates of loop imbalances and receiver heat losses. Comparison against drone-based infrared thermography (QScan) shows strong correspondence, correctly identifying all areas with high-loss receivers. This demonstrates that noisy real-world CSP operational data contain enough information to recover latent physical parameters when combined with appropriate modeling and differentiable optimization.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型剪枝面临挑战：完全重训练成本过高，传统全局幅度剪枝对Transformer架构效果不佳，现有方法依赖近似或启发式算法，整数规划求解计算不可行。

Method: 提出1-swap剪枝算法：1) 通过行级等稀疏约束解耦问题；2) 利用校准数据的Gram矩阵高效计算最优1-swap（交换一个保留权重和一个剪枝权重）；3) 从任意剪枝掩码开始，在GPU上高效运行，基本无超参数。

Result: 相比Wanda方法，将每层剪枝误差降低高达60%；在多种GPT架构上一致提升困惑度和零样本准确率。

Conclusion: 通过行级约束和1-swap优化，将大语言模型剪枝问题变得可处理，提供了一种高效、超参数少且性能优越的剪枝解决方案。

Abstract: The resource requirements of Neural Networks can be significantly reduced through pruning -- the removal of seemingly less important parameters. However, with the rise of Large Language Models (LLMs), full retraining to recover pruning-induced performance degradation is often prohibitive and classical approaches such as global magnitude pruning are suboptimal on Transformer architectures. State-of-the-art methods hence solve a layer-wise mask selection problem, the problem of finding a pruning mask which minimizes the per-layer pruning error on a small set of calibration data. Exactly solving this problem to optimality using Integer Programming (IP) solvers is computationally infeasible due to its combinatorial nature and the size of the search space, and existing approaches therefore rely on approximations or heuristics. In this work, we demonstrate that the mask selection problem can be made drastically more tractable at LLM scale. To that end, we decouple the rows by enforcing equal sparsity levels per row. This allows us to derive optimal 1-swaps (exchanging one kept and one pruned weight) that can be computed efficiently using the Gram matrix of the calibration data. Using these observations, we propose a tractable and simple 1-swap algorithm that warm starts from any pruning mask, runs efficiently on GPUs at LLM scale, and is essentially hyperparameter-free. We demonstrate that our approach reduces per-layer pruning error by up to 60% over Wanda (Sun et al., 2023) and consistently improves perplexity and zero-shot accuracy across state-of-the-art GPT architectures.

Motivation: 水下环境自主导航面临GPS缺失、能见度差、水下障碍物等挑战，需要开发鲁棒的导航算法来应对这些困难。

Method: 采用基于PPO的深度强化学习方法，结合目标导向导航信息、虚拟占用网格和操作区域边界的射线投射作为观测空间，在BlueROV2平台上实现。

Abstract: Autonomous navigation in underwater environments remains a major challenge due to the absence of GPS, degraded visibility, and the presence of submerged obstacles. This article investigates these issues through the case of the BlueROV2, an open platform widely used for scientific experimentation. We propose a deep reinforcement learning approach based on the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm, using an observation space that combines target-oriented navigation information, a virtual occupancy grid, and ray-casting along the boundaries of the operational area. The learned policy is compared against a reference deterministic kinematic planner, the Dynamic Window Approach (DWA), commonly employed as a robust baseline for obstacle avoidance. The evaluation is conducted in a realistic simulation environment and complemented by validation on a physical BlueROV2 supervised by a 3D digital twin of the test site, helping to reduce risks associated with real-world experimentation. The results show that the PPO policy consistently outperforms DWA in highly cluttered environments, notably thanks to better local adaptation and reduced collisions. Finally, the experiments demonstrate the transferability of the learned behavior from simulation to the real world, confirming the relevance of deep RL for autonomous navigation in underwater robotics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 时间差分方法存在自举偏差问题，块评论家方法通过估计短动作序列的价值来加速价值备份，但从中提取策略面临挑战：策略必须开环输出整个动作块，这在需要策略反应性的环境中可能次优，且当块长度增长时建模困难。

Method: 提出解耦评论家与策略的块长度，策略在较短动作块上运行。通过从原始块评论家乐观回溯构建部分动作块的蒸馏评论家，近似部分动作块扩展为完整块时可实现的最大价值，从而优化策略。

Result: 在具有挑战性的长时域离线目标条件任务上评估，该方法可靠地优于先前方法。

Conclusion: 该方法既保留了多步价值传播的优势，又避免了开环次优性和学习长动作块策略的困难，为块评论家方法提供了有效的策略提取解决方案。

Abstract: Temporal-difference (TD) methods learn state and action values efficiently by bootstrapping from their own future value predictions, but such a self-bootstrapping mechanism is prone to bootstrapping bias, where the errors in the value targets accumulate across steps and result in biased value estimates. Recent work has proposed to use chunked critics, which estimate the value of short action sequences ("chunks") rather than individual actions, speeding up value backup. However, extracting policies from chunked critics is challenging: policies must output the entire action chunk open-loop, which can be sub-optimal for environments that require policy reactivity and also challenging to model especially when the chunk length grows. Our key insight is to decouple the chunk length of the critic from that of the policy, allowing the policy to operate over shorter action chunks. We propose a novel algorithm that achieves this by optimizing the policy against a distilled critic for partial action chunks, constructed by optimistically backing up from the original chunked critic to approximate the maximum value achievable when a partial action chunk is extended to a complete one. This design retains the benefits of multi-step value propagation while sidestepping both the open-loop sub-optimality and the difficulty of learning action chunking policies for long action chunks. We evaluate our method on challenging, long-horizon offline goal-conditioned tasks and show that it reliably outperforms prior methods. Code: github.com/ColinQiyangLi/dqc.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM的推理过程需要顺序执行（先思考后回答），这限制了实时交互应用（如语音助手）的实用性。人类可以异步处理信息，而现有LLM无法做到这一点

Method: 利用旋转嵌入（rotary embeddings）的特性，使原本设计用于顺序交互的LLM能够同时进行思考、倾听和输出生成，无需额外训练

Conclusion: 通过利用旋转嵌入的特性，成功实现了LLM的异步推理能力，显著提升了实时交互性能，为语音助手等实时应用提供了可行的解决方案

Abstract: Many state-of-the-art LLMs are trained to think before giving their answer. Reasoning can greatly improve language model capabilities and safety, but it also makes them less interactive: given a new input, a model must stop thinking before it can respond. Real-world use cases such as voice-based or embedded assistants require an LLM agent to respond and adapt to additional information in real time, which is incompatible with sequential interactions. In contrast, humans can listen, think, and act asynchronously: we begin thinking about the problem while reading it and continue thinking while formulating the answer. In this work, we augment LLMs capable of reasoning to operate in a similar way without additional training. Our method uses the properties of rotary embeddings to enable LLMs built for sequential interactions to simultaneously think, listen, and generate outputs. We evaluate our approach on math, commonsense, and safety reasoning and find that it can generate accurate thinking-augmented answers in real time, reducing time to first non-thinking token from minutes to <= 5s. and the overall real-time delays by 6-11x.

Motivation: 神经网络对抗攻击构建对其部署至关重要，需要快速有效的方法评估对抗鲁棒性。由于对抗攻击构建本质上是优化问题，需要从数值优化角度寻找高效解决方案。

Method: 采用先进的免投影方法（改进的Frank-Wolfe方法）构建白盒对抗攻击，进行理论和数值评估，并与基于投影操作或几何直觉的标准方法进行比较。

Abstract: The construction of adversarial attacks for neural networks appears to be a crucial challenge for their deployment in various services. To estimate the adversarial robustness of a neural network, a fast and efficient approach is needed to construct adversarial attacks. Since the formalization of adversarial attack construction involves solving a specific optimization problem, we consider the problem of constructing an efficient and effective adversarial attack from a numerical optimization perspective. Specifically, we suggest utilizing advanced projection-free methods, known as modified Frank-Wolfe methods, to construct white-box adversarial attacks on the given input data. We perform a theoretical and numerical evaluation of these methods and compare them with standard approaches based on projection operations or geometrical intuition. Numerical experiments are performed on the MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets, utilizing a multiclass logistic regression model, the convolutional neural networks (CNNs), and the Vision Transformer (ViT).

TL;DR: 本文提出Derf函数作为归一化层的替代方案，在多个领域超越LayerNorm、RMSNorm和DyT，主要优势在于更好的泛化能力而非拟合能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然归一化层长期以来被视为深度学习架构的必备组件，但最近的Dynamic Tanh (DyT)表明存在替代方案。本研究旨在寻找比DyT更有效的函数设计，探索点函数的内在特性如何影响训练和性能。

Method: 首先研究点函数的内在特性对训练和性能的影响，然后进行大规模搜索寻找更有效的函数设计。最终提出Derf(x) = erf(αx + s)函数，其中erf(x)是重新缩放的高斯累积分布函数。

Result: Derf在多个领域（视觉、语音表示、DNA序列建模）均优于LayerNorm、RMSNorm和DyT。性能提升主要源于更好的泛化能力而非更强的拟合能力。

Conclusion: Derf的简单性和更强的性能使其成为无归一化Transformer架构的实用选择，为归一化层提供了有效的替代方案。

Abstract: Although normalization layers have long been viewed as indispensable components of deep learning architectures, the recent introduction of Dynamic Tanh (DyT) has demonstrated that alternatives are possible. The point-wise function DyT constrains extreme values for stable convergence and reaches normalization-level performance; this work seeks further for function designs that can surpass it. We first study how the intrinsic properties of point-wise functions influence training and performance. Building on these findings, we conduct a large-scale search for a more effective function design. Through this exploration, we introduce $\mathrm{Derf}(x) = \mathrm{erf}(αx + s)$, where $\mathrm{erf}(x)$ is the rescaled Gaussian cumulative distribution function, and identify it as the most performant design. Derf outperforms LayerNorm, RMSNorm, and DyT across a wide range of domains, including vision (image recognition and generation), speech representation, and DNA sequence modeling. Our findings suggest that the performance gains of Derf largely stem from its improved generalization rather than stronger fitting capacity. Its simplicity and stronger performance make Derf a practical choice for normalization-free Transformer architectures.

Conclusion: DaSH在低资源设置和缺乏相关数据集的情况下表现稳健，适用于实际多源学习工作流中的可扩展自适应数据集选择

Abstract: The success of modern machine learning hinges on access to high-quality training data. In many real-world scenarios, such as acquiring data from public repositories or sharing across institutions, data is naturally organized into discrete datasets that vary in relevance, quality, and utility. Selecting which repositories or institutions to search for useful datasets, and which datasets to incorporate into model training are therefore critical decisions, yet most existing methods select individual samples and treat all data as equally relevant, ignoring differences between datasets and their sources. In this work, we formalize the task of dataset selection: selecting entire datasets from a large, heterogeneous pool to improve downstream performance under resource constraints. We propose Dataset Selection via Hierarchies (DaSH), a dataset selection method that models utility at both dataset and group (e.g., collections, institutions) levels, enabling efficient generalization from limited observations. Across two public benchmarks (Digit-Five and DomainNet), DaSH outperforms state-of-the-art data selection baselines by up to 26.2% in accuracy, while requiring significantly fewer exploration steps. Ablations show DaSH is robust to low-resource settings and lack of relevant datasets, making it suitable for scalable and adaptive dataset selection in practical multi-source learning workflows.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统归一化流需要精确的解析逆变换，这限制了架构设计和损失函数的灵活性。TARFlow等基于Transformer的自回归流方法虽然复兴了NF，但暴露了因果解码作为主要瓶颈的问题。

Method: 提出BiFlow框架，学习一个近似噪声到数据逆映射的反向模型，而不是依赖精确的解析逆。这使得可以使用更灵活的损失函数和架构设计。

Result: 在ImageNet上，相比因果解码对应方法，BiFlow提高了生成质量，同时将采样速度加速了高达两个数量级。在基于NF的方法中达到最先进水平，在单评估方法中具有竞争力。

Conclusion: BiFlow通过移除精确解析逆的要求，为归一化流提供了更灵活的设计空间，有望进一步推动这一经典范式的发展。

Abstract: Normalizing Flows (NFs) have been established as a principled framework for generative modeling. Standard NFs consist of a forward process and a reverse process: the forward process maps data to noise, while the reverse process generates samples by inverting it. Typical NF forward transformations are constrained by explicit invertibility, ensuring that the reverse process can serve as their exact analytic inverse. Recent developments in TARFlow and its variants have revitalized NF methods by combining Transformers and autoregressive flows, but have also exposed causal decoding as a major bottleneck. In this work, we introduce Bidirectional Normalizing Flow ($\textbf{BiFlow}$), a framework that removes the need for an exact analytic inverse. BiFlow learns a reverse model that approximates the underlying noise-to-data inverse mapping, enabling more flexible loss functions and architectures. Experiments on ImageNet demonstrate that BiFlow, compared to its causal decoding counterpart, improves generation quality while accelerating sampling by up to two orders of magnitude. BiFlow yields state-of-the-art results among NF-based methods and competitive performance among single-evaluation ("1-NFE") methods. Following recent encouraging progress on NFs, we hope our work will draw further attention to this classical paradigm.
