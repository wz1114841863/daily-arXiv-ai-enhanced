Despite these\nchanges, publicly available test cases remain scarce, due to security concerns\nand the significant effort required to anonymize real systems. Such limitations\ncall for generative tools that can jointly synthesize grid structure and nodal\ndynamics. However, modeling the joint distribution of network topology, branch\nattributes, bus properties, and dynamic load profiles remains a major\nchallenge, while preserving physical feasibility and avoiding prohibitive\ncomputational costs. We present PowerGrow, a co-generative framework that\nsignificantly reduces computational overhead while maintaining operational\nvalidity. The core idea is dependence decomposition: the complex joint\ndistribution is factorized into a chain of conditional distributions over\nfeasible grid topologies, time-series bus loads, and other system attributes,\nleveraging their mutual dependencies. By constraining the generation process at\neach stage, we implement a hierarchical graph beta-diffusion process for\nstructural synthesis, paired with a temporal autoencoder that embeds\ntime-series data into a compact latent space, improving both training stability\nand sample fidelity. Experiments across benchmark settings show that PowerGrow\nnot only outperforms prior diffusion models in fidelity and diversity but also\nachieves a 98.9\\% power flow convergence rate and improved N-1 contingency\nresilience.

Hyperparameter tuning provided further insight into suitable\nconfigurations for wave scattering problems. At comparable accuracy, PINNs\nproduced consistent solutions but required training times approximately 42\ntimes longer than BEM. However, once trained, PINNs achieved evaluation times\nup to 204 times faster. The generalization capacity was also assessed outside\nthe PINN training domain, where the relative error increased from $7.46 \\times\n10^{-2}$ to 8.22, while BEM maintained a similar error level in the extended\nregion.\n  Originality/value - This work presents a direct comparison between PINNs and\nBEM for the Helmholtz equation.

Regularization methods are vital for preventing catastrophic\nforgetting in GCL, particularly in the challenging replay-free,\nclass-incremental setting, where each task consists of a set of unique classes.\nIn this work, we first establish a general regularization framework for GCL\nbased on the curved parameter space induced by the Fisher information matrix\n(FIM). We show that the dominant Elastic Weight Consolidation (EWC) and its\nvariants are a special case within this framework, using a diagonal\napproximation of the empirical FIM based on parameters from previous tasks. To\novercome their limitations, we propose a new unbiased online curvature\napproximation of the full FIM based on the model's current learning state. Our\nmethod directly estimates the regularization term in an online manner without\nexplicitly evaluating and storing the FIM itself.

On LLaMA3-8B instruction tuning, NoRA++\nconsistently improves generation quality, yielding average MMLU gains of\n+0.3\\%--0.8\\%, including +1.6\\% on STEM (Alpaca) and +1.3\\% on OpenOrca. We\nfurther show that NoRA constrains adaptation to a low-dimensional functional\nsubspace, implicitly regularizing update magnitude and direction. These results\nestablish activation-space tuning as a complementary and highly\nparameter-efficient alternative to weight-based PEFT, positioning activation\nfunctions as first-class objects for model adaptation."}

Technical Report submitted to a\n  journal for publication", "summary": "Uncertainty quantification (UQ) is vital for trustworthy deep learning, yet\nexisting methods are either computationally intensive, such as Bayesian or\nensemble methods, or provide only partial, task-specific estimates, such as\nsingle-forward-pass techniques. In this paper, we propose a post-hoc\nsingle-forward-pass framework that jointly captures aleatoric and epistemic\nuncertainty without modifying or retraining pretrained models. Our method\napplies \\emph{Split-Point Analysis} (SPA) to decompose predictive residuals\ninto upper and lower subsets, computing \\emph{Mean Absolute Residuals} (MARs)\non each side. We prove that, under ideal conditions, the total MAR equals the\nharmonic mean of subset MARs; deviations define a novel \\emph{Self-consistency\nDiscrepancy Score} (SDS) for fine-grained epistemic estimation across\nregression and classification. For regression, side-specific quantile\nregression yields prediction intervals with improved empirical coverage, which\nare further calibrated via SDS. For classification, when calibration data are\navailable, we apply SPA-based calibration identities to adjust the softmax\noutputs and then compute predictive entropy on these calibrated probabilities.\nExtensive experiments on diverse regression and classification benchmarks\ndemonstrate that our framework matches or exceeds several state-of-the-art UQ\nmethods while incurring minimal overhead.\n  Our source code is available at https://github.com/zzz0527/SPC-UQ."}

The success of such attacks\nheavily relies on their stealthiness, the ability to blend in with the original\ngraph and evade detection. However, existing methods often achieve stealthiness\nby relying on indirect proxy metrics, lacking consideration for the fundamental\ncharacteristics of the injected content, or focusing only on imitating local\nstructures, which leads to the problem of local myopia. To overcome these\nlimitations, we propose a dual-constraint stealthy node injection framework,\ncalled Joint Alignment of Nodal and Universal Structures (JANUS). At the local\nlevel, we introduce a local feature manifold alignment strategy to achieve\ngeometric consistency in the feature space. At the global level, we incorporate\nstructured latent variables and maximize the mutual information with the\ngenerated structures, ensuring the injected structures are consistent with the\nsemantic patterns of the original graph. We model the injection attack as a\nsequential decision process, which is optimized by a reinforcement learning\nagent. Experiments on multiple standard datasets demonstrate that the JANUS\nframework significantly outperforms existing methods in terms of both attack\neffectiveness and stealthiness."}

However, whether large language models (LLMs) can\naccurately predict nutritional values based solely on text descriptions of\nfoods consumed remains unknown. If effective, this approach could enable\nsimpler dietary monitoring without the need for photographs. METHODS: We used\n24-hour dietary recalls from adolescents aged 12-19 years in the National\nHealth and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). An open-source quantized LLM\nwas prompted using a 10-shot, chain-of-thought approach to estimate energy and\nfive macronutrients based solely on text strings listing foods and their\nquantities. We then applied parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) to evaluate\nwhether predictive accuracy improved. NHANES-calculated values served as the\nground truth for energy, proteins, carbohydrates, total sugar, dietary fiber\nand total fat. RESULTS: In a pooled dataset of 11,281 adolescents (49.9% male,\nmean age 15.4 years), the vanilla LLM yielded poor predictions. The mean\nabsolute error (MAE) was 652.08 for energy and the Lin's CCC <0.46 across\nendpoints. In contrast, the fine-tuned model performed substantially better,\nwith energy MAEs ranging from 171.34 to 190.90 across subsets, and Lin's CCC\nexceeding 0.89 for all outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: When prompted using a\nchain-of-thought approach and fine-tuned with PEFT, open-source LLMs exposed\nsolely to text input can accurately predict energy and macronutrient values\nfrom 24-hour dietary recalls. This approach holds promise for low-burden,\ntext-based dietary monitoring tools."}

Proprietary agentic systems like DeepResearch have demonstrated\nsuperhuman capabilities on extremely complex information-seeking benchmarks\nsuch as BrowseComp, a feat previously unattainable.

Based on this insight, we introduce WebSailor, a\ncomplete post-training methodology designed to instill this crucial capability.\nOur approach involves generating novel, high-uncertainty tasks through\nstructured sampling and information obfuscation, RFT cold start, and an\nefficient agentic RL training algorithm, Duplicating Sampling Policy\nOptimization (DUPO).
