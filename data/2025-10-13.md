TL;DR: 提出EDS框架，通过基于能量的推理时干预，在保持安全性的同时显著降低大语言模型的错误拒绝率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的安全对齐技术往往只关注对抗有害提示，导致模型变得过度谨慎，拒绝回答良性提示。需要在增强安全性的同时减少错误拒绝

Method: 训练轻量级外部能量模型，将LLM内部激活映射到能量景观，使用能量函数的梯度动态引导隐藏状态到低能量区域，实时修正模型响应

Result: 在ORB-H基准测试中，合规率从57.3%提升到82.6%，同时保持基线安全性能，显著降低错误拒绝率

Conclusion: EDS提供了一种有效范式，构建同时具有低错误拒绝率和高安全性的大语言模型

Abstract: Safety alignment of large language models (LLMs) faces a key challenge:
current alignment techniques often only focus on improving safety against
harmful prompts, causing LLMs to become over-cautious and refuse to respond to
benign prompts. Therefore, a key objective of safe alignment is to enhance
safety while simultaneously reducing false refusals. In this paper, we
introduce Energy-Driven Steering (EDS), a novel, fine-tuning free framework
designed to resolve this challenge through dynamic, inference-time
intervention. We trained a lightweight, external Energy-Based Model (EBM) to
assign high energy to undesirable (false refusal or jailbreak) states and low
energy to desirable (helpful response or safe reject) ones. During inference,
EBM maps the LLM's internal activations to an "energy landscape". We use the
gradient of the energy function to dynamically steer the LLM's hidden states to
low energy regions, correcting the model to generate a desirable response in
real-time without modifying its weights. This method decouples behavioral
control from the model's core knowledge, offering a flexible solution with
minimal computational overhead. Extensive experiments across a wide range of
models show our method successfully achieves this objective: it substantially
lowers false refusal rates. For example, raising compliance on the ORB-H
benchmark from 57.3% to 82.6% while maintaining the baseline safety
performance. Our work presents an effective paradigm for building LLMs that
achieve both low false refusal rates and high safety.

### [2] [Inverse-Free Wilson Loops for Transformers: A Practical Diagnostic for Invariance and Order Sensitivity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08648)
*Edward Y. Chang,Ethan Y. Chang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: WILSON是一个后处理诊断工具包，通过检查内部表示的循环和重排序来检测大语言模型在无害编辑下的答案变化问题，帮助在不改变模型架构或训练的情况下提高可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在实际应用中存在答案不稳定的问题：RAG输出随段落重排序而翻转、微调侵蚀预训练学到的恒定性、辩论或思维链提示依赖路径选择、编译器融合或重排序在决策边界附近扰动logits。这些违反预期恒定性，破坏持续集成，迫使团队在安全性和速度之间权衡。

Method: WILSON结合了基于位置和层的无逆曲率图（使用JVP和Hutchinson探针计算）和激活级交换子来标记重排序风险。信号计算成本低，适用于标准Transformer模型，并导出为阈值和CSV文件供编排器使用。

Result: WILSON能够实现具体行动：保护RAG免受顺序效应影响、捕获微调回归、稳定辩论路径和长多轮上下文、在部署中控制融合或重排序。

Conclusion: WILSON帮助预测故障并批准安全优化，使得可靠性和吞吐量能够共同提升，而无需改变模型架构或训练。

Abstract: Large language models can change answers under harmless edits that matter in
practice: RAG outputs flip when passages are reordered, fine-tuning erodes
invariances learned at pretraining, debate or chain-of-thought prompts take
path-dependent routes, and compiler fusion or reordering perturbs logits near
decision boundaries. These failures violate intended invariances, break
continuous integration, and force teams to trade safety for speed. The effects
are small yet distributed across layers and positions, sensitive to context
length and evaluation order, and costly to repair with retraining or formal
verification. We present WILSON, a minimal post-hoc diagnostic suite that
converts simple loop and reordering checks on internal representations into
system signals. WILSON combines an inverse-free curvature map over positions
and layers, computed with JVPs and Hutchinson probes, with activation-level
commutators that flag reorder risk. Signals are cheap to compute,
model-agnostic for standard Transformers, and exported as thresholds and CSV
artifacts for orchestrators. This enables concrete actions: guard RAG against
order effects, catch fine-tuning regressions, stabilize debate pathways and
long multi-turn contexts, and gate fusions or reorders in deployment. In short,
WILSON helps anticipate failures and approve safe optimizations so reliability
and throughput can improve together without changing model architecture or
training.

### [3] [Knowledge Graph Sparsification for GNN-based Rare Disease Diagnosis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08655)

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RareNet是一种基于子图的图神经网络，仅需患者表型数据即可识别最可能的致病基因，并检索相关患者子图用于临床调查，特别适用于资源有限的环境。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 罕见遗传病诊断面临患者数据不足、全基因组测序难以获取、致病基因数量庞大等挑战，导致诊断周期长、治疗不当和关键延误，特别是在资源有限的环境中。

Method: 提出RareNet，一种基于子图的图神经网络方法，仅使用患者表型数据来识别最可能的致病基因，并检索相关的患者子图进行针对性临床调查。

Result: 在两个生物医学数据集上的综合评估显示，RareNet在致病基因预测方面具有竞争力和鲁棒性，与其他框架集成时能显著提升性能。

Conclusion: RareNet通过仅需表型数据，使复杂遗传分析更易获取，特别对缺乏先进基因组基础设施的服务不足人群具有重要价值。

Abstract: Rare genetic disease diagnosis faces critical challenges: insufficient
patient data, inaccessible full genome sequencing, and the immense number of
possible causative genes. These limitations cause prolonged diagnostic
journeys, inappropriate treatments, and critical delays, disproportionately
affecting patients in resource-limited settings where diagnostic tools are
scarce. We propose RareNet, a subgraph-based Graph Neural Network that requires
only patient phenotypes to identify the most likely causal gene and retrieve
focused patient subgraphs for targeted clinical investigation. RareNet can
function as a standalone method or serve as a pre-processing or post-processing
filter for other candidate gene prioritization methods, consistently enhancing
their performance while potentially enabling explainable insights. Through
comprehensive evaluation on two biomedical datasets, we demonstrate competitive
and robust causal gene prediction and significant performance gains when
integrated with other frameworks. By requiring only phenotypic data, which is
readily available in any clinical setting, RareNet democratizes access to
sophisticated genetic analysis, offering particular value for underserved
populations lacking advanced genomic infrastructure.

### [4] [Reinforcement Learning-Driven Edge Management for Reliable Multi-view 3D Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08839)
*Motahare Mounesan,Sourya Saha,Houchao Gan,Md. Nurul Absur,Saptarshi Debroy*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出基于强化学习的边缘资源管理框架，用于在资源受限和易受干扰的环境中实现可靠的实时多视角3D重建。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 边缘环境中的动态和不可预测资源可用性（如图像质量下降、网络不稳定、服务器负载波动）对3D重建管道的可靠性构成挑战，特别是在消防救援等关键应用中需要及时准确的三维场景建模。

Method: 采用两个协作的Q-learning智能体：一个用于相机选择，一个用于服务器选择，两者完全在线运行，通过与边缘环境交互学习策略。在包含实验室终端设备和FABRIC基础设施托管边缘服务器的分布式测试床上进行实现和评估。

Result: 结果表明，所提出的框架通过有效平衡端到端延迟和重建质量，在动态环境中提高了应用可靠性。

Conclusion: 基于强化学习的边缘资源管理框架能够在资源受限和易受干扰的环境中实现可靠的3D重建，确保在合理时间内获得高质量的重建结果。

Abstract: Real-time multi-view 3D reconstruction is a mission-critical application for
key edge-native use cases, such as fire rescue, where timely and accurate 3D
scene modeling enables situational awareness and informed decision-making.
However, the dynamic and unpredictable nature of edge resource availability
introduces disruptions, such as degraded image quality, unstable network links,
and fluctuating server loads, which challenge the reliability of the
reconstruction pipeline. In this work, we present a reinforcement learning
(RL)-based edge resource management framework for reliable 3D reconstruction to
ensure high quality reconstruction within a reasonable amount of time, despite
the system operating under a resource-constrained and disruption-prone
environment. In particular, the framework adopts two cooperative Q-learning
agents, one for camera selection and one for server selection, both of which
operate entirely online, learning policies through interactions with the edge
environment. To support learning under realistic constraints and evaluate
system performance, we implement a distributed testbed comprising lab-hosted
end devices and FABRIC infrastructure-hosted edge servers to emulate smart city
edge infrastructure under realistic disruption scenarios. Results show that the
proposed framework improves application reliability by effectively balancing
end-to-end latency and reconstruction quality in dynamic environments.

### [5] [Inner-Instance Normalization for Time Series Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08657)
*Zipo Jibao,Yingyi Fu,Xinyang Chen,Guoting Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文提出了两种点级方法（LD和LCD）来解决时间序列预测中的实例内分布偏移问题，通过在不同时间步使用不同参数来消除内部差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界时间序列具有复杂的非平稳特性，导致分布偏移，影响模型性能。现有方法未能处理实例内的分布偏移，导致性能不佳。

Method: 提出了两种点级方法：学习分布（LD）通过在不同时间步使用不同参数拟合输入和输出的内部分布；学习条件分布（LCD）使用神经网络预测输出的缩放系数。

Result: 在多个公共基准测试中，使用不同骨干模型评估了两种方法的性能，通过对比实验证明了点级范式的有效性。

Conclusion: 点级方法能够有效解决时间序列预测中的实例内分布偏移问题，提升模型性能。

Abstract: Real-world time series are influenced by numerous factors and exhibit complex
non-stationary characteristics. Non-stationarity can lead to distribution
shifts, where the statistical properties of time series change over time,
negatively impacting model performance. Several instance normalization
techniques have been proposed to address distribution shifts in time series
forecasting. However, existing methods fail to account for shifts within
individual instances, leading to suboptimal performance. To tackle
inner-instance distribution shifts, we propose two novel point-level methods:
Learning Distribution (LD) and Learning Conditional Distribution (LCD). LD
eliminates internal discrepancies by fitting the internal distribution of input
and output with different parameters at different time steps, while LCD
utilizes neural networks to predict scaling coefficients of the output. We
evaluate the performance of the two methods with various backbone models across
public benchmarks and demonstrate the effectiveness of the point-level paradigm
through comparative experiments.

### [6] [Provably Robust Adaptation for Language-Empowered Foundation Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08659)
*Yuni Lai,Xiaoyu Xue,Linghui Shen,Yulun Wu,Gaolei Li,Song Guo,Kai Zhou,Bin Xiao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了第一个针对语言赋能基础模型的具有可证明鲁棒性的少样本分类器LeFCert，通过双重修剪均值原型和自适应混合机制，在中毒攻击下提供可证明的鲁棒性保证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的语言赋能基础模型在少样本学习中依赖开放环境中收集的小型任务特定支持数据集，容易受到中毒攻击，而现有防御方法缺乏形式化保证且对未知和自适应攻击脆弱。

Method: LeFCert整合文本和特征嵌入与自适应混合机制，提出双重修剪均值原型，推导分类分数的可证明上下界。还提出了LeFCert-L（引入随机平滑）和LeFCert-C（集体认证）两个变体。

Result: 实验表明LeFCert实现了最先进的性能，在干净准确率和认证准确率方面均显著优于现有基线方法，同时计算效率高。

Conclusion: LeFCert是第一个为语言赋能基础模型提供可证明鲁棒性的少样本分类器，在保持计算效率的同时显著提升了对抗中毒攻击的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Language-empowered foundation models (LeFMs), such as CLIP and GraphCLIP,
have transformed multimodal learning by aligning visual (or graph) features
with textual representations, enabling powerful downstream capabilities like
few-shot learning. However, the reliance on small, task-specific support
datasets collected in open environments exposes these models to poisoning
attacks, where adversaries manipulate the support samples to degrade
performance. Existing defenses rely on empirical strategies, which lack formal
guarantees and remain vulnerable to unseen and adaptive attacks. Certified
robustness offers provable guarantees but has been largely unexplored for
few-shot classifiers based on LeFMs. This study seeks to fill these critical
gaps by proposing the first provably robust few-shot classifier that is
tailored for LeFMs. We term our model Language-empowered Few-shot Certification
(\textbf{LeFCert}). It integrates both textual and feature embeddings with an
adaptive blending mechanism. To achieve provable robustness, we propose a
twofold trimmed mean prototype and derive provable upper and lower bounds for
classification scores, enabling certification under worst-case poisoning
scenarios. To further enhance the performance, we extend LeFCert with two
variants by considering a more realistic and tighter attack budget: LeFCert-L
incorporates randomized smoothing to provide Lipschitz continuity and derive
robustness under dual budget constraints, and LeFCert-C provides collective
certification for scenarios where attackers distribute a shared poisoning
budget across multiple samples. Experiments demonstrate that LeFCert achieves
state-of-the-art performance, significantly improving both clean and certified
accuracy compared to existing baselines. Despite its advanced robustness
mechanisms, LeFCert is computationally efficient, making it practical for
real-world applications.

### [7] [How Scale Breaks "Normalized Stress" and KL Divergence: Rethinking Quality Metrics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08660)
*Kiran Smelser,Kaviru Gunaratne,Jacob Miller,Stephen Kobourov*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文分析了高维数据可视化中常用的质量指标（归一化应力和KL散度）对尺度变换的敏感性，并提出了一种简单方法使这些指标具有尺度不变性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前高维数据可视化中常用的质量指标对均匀缩放敏感，即使缩放不会实质性改变投影的特性，这影响了维度缩减技术评估的准确性。

Method: 通过分析和实证研究尺度对应力和KL散度的影响，提出了一种简单技术使这两个质量指标具有尺度不变性。

Result: 研究表明尺度变换会显著改变质量指标值，提出的尺度不变方法在小基准测试中准确捕捉了预期行为。

Conclusion: 质量指标的尺度敏感性会影响维度缩减技术的评估，提出的尺度不变方法能够更准确地评估投影质量。

Abstract: Complex, high-dimensional data is ubiquitous across many scientific
disciplines, including machine learning, biology, and the social sciences. One
of the primary methods of visualizing these datasets is with two-dimensional
scatter plots that visually capture some properties of the data. Because
visually determining the accuracy of these plots is challenging, researchers
often use quality metrics to measure the projection's accuracy and faithfulness
to the original data. One of the most commonly employed metrics, normalized
stress, is sensitive to uniform scaling (stretching, shrinking) of the
projection, despite this act not meaningfully changing anything about the
projection. Another quality metric, the Kullback--Leibler (KL) divergence used
in the popular t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) technique,
is also susceptible to this scale sensitivity. We investigate the effect of
scaling on stress and KL divergence analytically and empirically by showing
just how much the values change and how this affects dimension reduction
technique evaluations. We introduce a simple technique to make both metrics
scale-invariant and show that it accurately captures expected behavior on a
small benchmark.

*Zipo Jibao,Yingyi Fu,Xinyang Chen,Guoting Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CATS-Linear模型通过分类辅助通道独立机制，将不同时间序列实例动态路由到专用预测器，并结合趋势-季节性解耦框架，在固定超参数下达到最先进的预测精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究显示线性模型在预测性能上可与复杂架构竞争，但增强线性模型的方法仍待探索。基于不同时间序列实例可能遵循异质线性映射的假设，需要开发更有效的线性模型增强方法。

Method: 提出CATS-Linear模型，采用分类辅助通道独立机制动态路由实例到专用预测器；重新设计趋势-季节性分解架构，添加解耦-线性映射-重耦合框架处理趋势分量，使用复数域线性投影处理季节性分量。

Result: 大量实验验证CATS-Linear在固定超参数下达到与超参数调优基线相当的SOTA精度，同时在固定超参数对比中提供SOTA准确性。

Conclusion: CATS-Linear通过动态实例路由和重新设计的分解架构，有效提升了线性模型的预测性能，在固定超参数设置下实现了竞争性的最先进精度。

Abstract: Recent research demonstrates that linear models achieve forecasting
performance competitive with complex architectures, yet methodologies for
enhancing linear models remain underexplored. Motivated by the hypothesis that
distinct time series instances may follow heterogeneous linear mappings, we
propose the Classification Auxiliary Trend-Seasonal Decoupling Linear Model
CATS-Linear, employing Classification Auxiliary Channel-Independence (CACI).
CACI dynamically routes instances to dedicated predictors via classification,
enabling supervised channel design. We further analyze the theoretical expected
risks of different channel settings. Additionally, we redesign the
trend-seasonal decomposition architecture by adding a decoupling -- linear
mapping -- recoupling framework for trend components and complex-domain linear
projections for seasonal components. Extensive experiments validate that
CATS-Linear with fixed hyperparameters achieves state-of-the-art accuracy
comparable to hyperparameter-tuned baselines while delivering SOTA accuracy
against fixed-hyperparameter counterparts.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DPCformer是一种结合CNN和自注意力机制的深度学习模型，用于基因组选择，在多种作物性状预测中显著优于传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基因组选择方法在处理复杂性状和大数据集时预测精度不足，需要更有效的模型来捕捉复杂的基因型-表型关系。

Method: 使用8维one-hot编码SNP数据，按染色体排序，采用PMF算法进行特征选择，结合CNN和自注意力机制建模。

Result: 在5种作物13个性状上测试，玉米性状精度提升达2.92%，棉花纤维性状提升8.37%，番茄小样本场景PCC提升57.35%，鹰嘴豆产量相关性提升16.62%。

Conclusion: DPCformer在精度、小样本鲁棒性和可解释性方面表现优异，为精准育种和粮食安全提供了有力工具。

Abstract: Genomic Selection (GS) uses whole-genome information to predict crop
phenotypes and accelerate breeding. Traditional GS methods, however, struggle
with prediction accuracy for complex traits and large datasets. We propose
DPCformer, a deep learning model integrating convolutional neural networks with
a self-attention mechanism to model complex genotype-phenotype relationships.
We applied DPCformer to 13 traits across five crops (maize, cotton, tomato,
rice, chickpea). Our approach uses an 8-dimensional one-hot encoding for SNP
data, ordered by chromosome, and employs the PMF algorithm for feature
selection. Evaluations show DPCformer outperforms existing methods. In maize
datasets, accuracy for traits like days to tasseling and plant height improved
by up to 2.92%. For cotton, accuracy gains for fiber traits reached 8.37%. On
small-sample tomato data, the Pearson Correlation Coefficient for a key trait
increased by up to 57.35%. In chickpea, the yield correlation was boosted by
16.62%. DPCformer demonstrates superior accuracy, robustness in small-sample
scenarios, and enhanced interpretability, providing a powerful tool for
precision breeding and addressing global food security challenges.

### [10] [FreqCa: Accelerating Diffusion Models via Frequency-Aware Caching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08669)
*Jiacheng Liu,Peiliang Cai,Qinming Zhou,Yuqi Lin,Deyang Kong,Benhao Huang,Yupei Pan,Haowen Xu,Chang Zou,Junshu Tang,Shikang Zheng,Linfeng Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出频率感知缓存(FreqCa)方法，通过分析扩散模型中不同频率分量的动态特性，对低频分量直接复用，对高频分量使用二阶Hermite插值预测，显著降低扩散变换器的推理成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有特征缓存方法假设相邻时间步的特征相似或连续，但这种假设并不总是成立。通过频域分析发现，扩散模型特征中不同频率分量具有不同的动态特性：低频分量相似度高但连续性差，高频分量连续性好但相似度低。

Method: 提出频率感知缓存(FreqCa)：1) 基于相似性直接复用低频分量特征；2) 使用二阶Hermite插值器预测易变的高频分量；3) 缓存累积残差特征(CRF)而非所有层特征，减少99%内存占用。

Result: 在FLUX.1-dev、FLUX.1-Kontext-dev、Qwen-Image和Qwen-Image-Edit等数据集上的广泛实验表明，该方法在生成和编辑任务中均有效。

Conclusion: 频率感知缓存方法通过利用不同频率分量的不同动态特性，有效降低了扩散变换器的推理成本，同时保持了生成和编辑质量。

Abstract: The application of diffusion transformers is suffering from their significant
inference costs. Recently, feature caching has been proposed to solve this
problem by reusing features from previous timesteps, thereby skipping
computation in future timesteps. However, previous feature caching assumes that
features in adjacent timesteps are similar or continuous, which does not always
hold in all settings. To investigate this, this paper begins with an analysis
from the frequency domain, which reveal that different frequency bands in the
features of diffusion models exhibit different dynamics across timesteps.
Concretely, low-frequency components, which decide the structure of images,
exhibit higher similarity but poor continuity. In contrast, the high-frequency
bands, which decode the details of images, show significant continuity but poor
similarity. These interesting observations motivate us to propose
Frequency-aware Caching (FreqCa)
  which directly reuses features of low-frequency components based on their
similarity, while using a second-order Hermite interpolator to predict the
volatile high-frequency ones based on its continuity.
  Besides, we further propose to cache Cumulative Residual Feature (CRF)
instead of the features in all the layers, which reduces the memory footprint
of feature caching by 99%.
  Extensive experiments on FLUX.1-dev, FLUX.1-Kontext-dev, Qwen-Image, and
Qwen-Image-Edit demonstrate its effectiveness in both generation and editing.
Codes are available in the supplementary materials and will be released on
GitHub.

*Yunzhen Feng,Parag Jain,Anthony Hartshorn,Yaqi Duan,Julia Kempe*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Error


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has become a standard
recipe for improving large language models (LLMs) on reasoning tasks, with
Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) widely used in practice. Yet GRPO
wastes substantial compute on negative groups: groups in which no sampled
response is correct yield zero advantage and thus no gradient. We ask whether
negative groups can be leveraged without extra supervision. Starting from a
maximum-likelihood (MLE) objective in reward modeling, we show that the MLE
gradient is equivalent to a policy gradient for a modified value function. This
value function adds a confidence-weighted penalty on incorrect responses,
imposing larger penalties on more confident mistakes. We refer to this as
\textbf{L}ikelihood \textbf{E}stimation with \textbf{N}egative \textbf{S}amples
(\textbf{LENS}). LENS modifies GRPO to assign non-zero, confidence-dependent
rewards to incorrect generations, making negative groups informative and
converting previously wasted samples into useful gradient updates. On the MATH
benchmark with Llama-3.1-8B and Qwen-2.5-3B, the proposed variant consistently
outperforms GRPO baseline, with significant gains on harder items. These
results demonstrate a principled and practical way to "rescue" negative groups,
improving efficiency and performance in RLVR.

TL;DR: 本文研究了基于上下文学习(ICL)的通道均衡器在非平稳时变信道中的适应能力，提出了从经典自适应信号处理算法(如LMS、LRMS)中汲取灵感的新型注意力机制设计，显著提升了在动态环境中的适应性和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的ICL均衡器主要针对静态信道设计，缺乏对非平稳时变信道的适应能力。本文旨在探索ICL在非平稳任务中的潜力，特别是时变信道均衡问题。

Method: 采用原则性框架设计高效的注意力机制，利用自适应信号处理算法(如LMS、LRMS)指导更好的设计，推导出新的注意力变体，包括多步梯度更新以改进长期跟踪能力。

Result: 实验结果表明ICL在非平稳MIMO均衡中表现出强大潜力，受经典自适应算法启发的注意力机制能显著增强动态环境中的适应性和性能。

Conclusion: ICL在非平稳信道均衡中具有重要应用前景，基于经典自适应算法的注意力机制设计为开发具有更强适应性和鲁棒性的下一代无线基础模型提供了关键见解。

Abstract: Channel equalization is fundamental for mitigating distortions such as
frequency-selective fading and inter-symbol interference. Unlike standard
supervised learning approaches that require costly retraining or fine-tuning
for each new task, in-context learning (ICL) adapts to new channels at
inference time with only a few examples. However, existing ICL-based equalizers
are primarily developed for and evaluated on static channels within the context
window. Indeed, to our knowledge, prior principled analyses and theoretical
studies of ICL focus exclusively on the stationary setting, where the function
remains fixed within the context. In this paper, we investigate the ability of
ICL to address non-stationary problems through the lens of time-varying channel
equalization. We employ a principled framework for designing efficient
attention mechanisms with improved adaptivity in non-stationary tasks,
leveraging algorithms from adaptive signal processing to guide better designs.
For example, new attention variants can be derived from the Least Mean Square
(LMS) adaptive algorithm, a Least Root Mean Square (LRMS) formulation for
enhanced robustness, or multi-step gradient updates for improved long-term
tracking. Experimental results demonstrate that ICL holds strong promise for
non-stationary MIMO equalization, and that attention mechanisms inspired by
classical adaptive algorithms can substantially enhance adaptability and
performance in dynamic environments. Our findings may provide critical insights
for developing next-generation wireless foundation models with stronger
adaptability and robustness.

TL;DR: 实例判别是一种自监督表示学习方法，将数据集中的每个实例视为独立类别，通过生成不同视图学习对变换不变的表示。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发自监督学习方法，无需人工标注即可学习有意义的表示，通过将每个实例视为独立类别来训练模型。

Method: 对每个实例应用随机变换生成两个不同视图，训练模型识别同一实例的不同视图，学习对变换不变的表示。

Result: 模型能够学习到对常见变换具有不变性的表示，捕捉实例的潜在语义特征。

Conclusion: 实例判别是有效的自监督学习范式，通过将实例视为类别并学习视图不变性，能够学习有意义的表示。

Abstract: Instance discrimination is a self-supervised representation learning paradigm
wherein individual instances within a dataset are treated as distinct classes.
This is typically achieved by generating two disparate views of each instance
by applying stochastic transformations, which encourages the model to learn
representations that are invariant to the common underlying object across these
views.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了Counterfactually Fair Conformal Prediction (CF-CP)方法，通过对称化受保护属性干预下的符合度分数，在保持边际覆盖性质的同时实现反事实公平的预测集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然点预测器的反事实公平性已有研究，但预测集的公平性（在不确定性下进行公平决策的关键）仍未被充分探索。同时，保形预测能提供有效的预测集但不保证反事实公平性。

Method: 通过对称化受保护属性干预下的符合度分数来开发CF-CP方法，该方法保持训练无关的简单路径。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上的回归和分类任务中，CF-CP实现了期望的反事实公平性，并以最小的预测集大小增加达到目标覆盖率。

Conclusion: CF-CP为反事实公平的不确定性量化提供了一个简单、训练无关的解决方案。

Abstract: While counterfactual fairness of point predictors is well studied, its
extension to prediction sets--central to fair decision-making under
uncertainty--remains underexplored. On the other hand, conformal prediction
(CP) provides efficient, distribution-free, finite-sample valid prediction
sets, yet does not ensure counterfactual fairness. We close this gap by
developing Counterfactually Fair Conformal Prediction (CF-CP) that produces
counterfactually fair prediction sets. Through symmetrization of conformity
scores across protected-attribute interventions, we prove that CF-CP results in
counterfactually fair prediction sets while maintaining the marginal coverage
property. Furthermore, we empirically demonstrate that on both synthetic and
real datasets, across regression and classification tasks, CF-CP achieves the
desired counterfactual fairness and meets the target coverage rate with minimal
increase in prediction set size. CF-CP offers a simple, training-free route to
counterfactually fair uncertainty quantification.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文为大型语言模型推理时内部状态控制技术提供了理论基础，解释了这些干预如何从Transformer架构的基本计算中产生，并提出了将文本输入转化为可重用权重更新的原则性方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大语言模型行为控制技术虽然有效，但往往基于经验启发式方法，缺乏理论支撑。本文旨在为这些向量和矩阵干预技术提供理论基础。

Method: 基于Dherin等人关于提示影响可数学映射为隐式权重更新的发现，将理论推广到深度多块Transformer。推导出将提示信息压缩为token无关的思想向量和思想矩阵的原则性方法。

Conclusion: 该研究为模型编辑技术提供了坚实的理论基础，展示了如何从Transformer架构的基本计算中推导出这些干预方法，并为文本到权重更新的转换提供了直接的计算基础。

Abstract: A growing body of research has demonstrated that the behavior of large
language models can be effectively controlled at inference time by directly
modifying their internal states, either through vector additions to their
activations or through updates to their weight matrices. These techniques,
while powerful, are often guided by empirical heuristics, such as deriving
steering vectors from the average activations of contrastive prompts. This work
provides a theoretical foundation for these interventions, explaining how they
emerge from the fundamental computations of the transformer architecture.
Building on the recent finding that a prompt's influence can be mathematically
mapped to implicit weight updates (Dherin et al., 2025), we generalize this
theory to deep, multi-block transformers. We show how the information contained
in any chunk of a user prompt is represented and composed internally through
weight vectors and weight matrices. We then derive a principled method for
condensing this information into token-independent thought vectors and thought
matrices. These constructs provide a theoretical explanation for existing
vector- and matrix-based model editing techniques and offer a direct,
computationally-grounded method for transmuting textual input into reusable
weight updates.

*Justin Lin,Julia Fukuyama*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文提出通过聚类SHAP值来理解黑盒模型的预测过程，将具有相似预测原因的数据样本分组，从而揭示模型决策的不同路径。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大数据和黑盒模型的普及，这些模型缺乏可解释性，在高风险应用中存在信任问题。需要开发方法来解释模型预测过程。

Method: 使用SHAP分析量化特征对预测的贡献，然后对SHAP值进行聚类，将具有相似预测原因的数据样本分组。通过模拟实验和阿尔茨海默病案例研究验证方法，并提出多分类瀑布图的新泛化。

Result: 成功展示了如何通过SHAP值聚类识别数据中不同的预测路径，在阿尔茨海默病案例中揭示了模型决策的多种机制。

Conclusion: SHAP值聚类提供了一种有效的方法来理解黑盒模型的预测过程，增强了模型的可解释性和可信度，特别是在高风险医疗应用中。

Abstract: In this growing age of data and technology, large black-box models are
becoming the norm due to their ability to handle vast amounts of data and learn
incredibly complex input-output relationships. The deficiency of these methods,
however, is their inability to explain the prediction process, making them
untrustworthy and their use precarious in high-stakes situations. SHapley
Additive exPlanations (SHAP) analysis is an explainable AI method growing in
popularity for its ability to explain model predictions in terms of the
original features. For each sample and feature in the data set, we associate a
SHAP value that quantifies the contribution of that feature to the prediction
of that sample. Clustering these SHAP values can provide insight into the data
by grouping samples that not only received the same prediction, but received
the same prediction for similar reasons. In doing so, we map the various
pathways through which distinct samples arrive at the same prediction. To
showcase this methodology, we present a simulated experiment in addition to a
case study in Alzheimer's disease using data from the Alzheimer's Disease
Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database. We also present a novel generalization
of the waterfall plot for multi-classification.

### [17] [Faithful and Interpretable Explanations for Complex Ensemble Time Series Forecasts using Surrogate Models and Forecastability Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08739)
*Yikai Zhao,Jiekai Ma*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出一个双方法框架，通过替代模型解释和频谱可预测性分析来解决复杂时间序列集成模型的解释性和可预测性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代时间序列预测依赖复杂的AutoML集成模型，虽然精度高但缺乏透明度和可解释性，需要解决准确性与可解释性之间的权衡问题。

Method: 1. 使用LightGBM替代模型模仿AutoGluon预测，实现SHAP特征归因；2. 集成频谱可预测性分析量化时间序列固有可预测性；3. 通过特征注入实验验证方法有效性。

Result: 在M5数据集上验证，高频谱可预测性不仅与预测精度正相关，还与替代模型保真度正相关；逐项归一化对生成有意义的SHAP解释至关重要。

Conclusion: 该框架为最先进的集成预测提供可解释的实例级解释，同时通过可预测性指标为用户提供预测和解释的可靠性指示。

Abstract: Modern time series forecasting increasingly relies on complex ensemble models
generated by AutoML systems like AutoGluon, delivering superior accuracy but
with significant costs to transparency and interpretability. This paper
introduces a comprehensive, dual-approach framework that addresses both the
explainability and forecastability challenges in complex time series ensembles.
First, we develop a surrogate-based explanation methodology that bridges the
accuracy-interpretability gap by training a LightGBM model to faithfully mimic
AutoGluon's time series forecasts, enabling stable SHAP-based feature
attributions. We rigorously validated this approach through feature injection
experiments, demonstrating remarkably high faithfulness between extracted SHAP
values and known ground truth effects. Second, we integrated spectral
predictability analysis to quantify each series' inherent forecastability. By
comparing each time series' spectral predictability to its pure noise
benchmarks, we established an objective mechanism to gauge confidence in
forecasts and their explanations. Our empirical evaluation on the M5 dataset
found that higher spectral predictability strongly correlates not only with
improved forecast accuracy but also with higher fidelity between the surrogate
and the original forecasting model. These forecastability metrics serve as
effective filtering mechanisms and confidence scores, enabling users to
calibrate their trust in both the forecasts and their explanations. We further
demonstrated that per-item normalization is essential for generating meaningful
SHAP explanations across heterogeneous time series with varying scales. The
resulting framework delivers interpretable, instance-level explanations for
state-of-the-art ensemble forecasts, while equipping users with forecastability
metrics that serve as reliability indicators for both predictions and their
explanations.

*Gang Liu,Jie Chen,Yihan Zhu,Michael Sun,Tengfei Luo,Nitesh V Chawla,Meng Jiang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DemoDiff是一种基于演示条件的扩散模型，通过少量分子-评分示例来定义任务上下文，实现分子设计的上下文学习，在33个设计任务中超越大100-1000倍的语言模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决分子设计中上下文学习效果有限的问题，现有数据库如ChEMBL包含数百万生物测定数据，但每个属性的标记数据仍然稀缺。

Method: 使用演示条件扩散模型，通过少量分子-评分示例指导去噪Transformer生成符合目标属性的分子；开发了节点对编码的分子标记器，在基序级别表示分子；构建了包含数百万上下文任务的数据集，预训练了7亿参数模型。

Result: 在6个类别的33个设计任务中，DemoDiff匹配或超越了比其大100-1000倍的语言模型，平均排名为3.63，优于领域特定方法的5.25-10.20。

Conclusion: DemoDiff可作为分子设计的分子基础模型，在上下文分子设计中表现出色。

Abstract: In-context learning allows large models to adapt to new tasks from a few
demonstrations, but it has shown limited success in molecular design. Existing
databases such as ChEMBL contain molecular properties spanning millions of
biological assays, yet labeled data for each property remain scarce. To address
this limitation, we introduce demonstration-conditioned diffusion models
(DemoDiff), which define task contexts using a small set of molecule-score
examples instead of text descriptions. These demonstrations guide a denoising
Transformer to generate molecules aligned with target properties. For scalable
pretraining, we develop a new molecular tokenizer with Node Pair Encoding that
represents molecules at the motif level, requiring 5.5$\times$ fewer nodes. We
curate a dataset containing millions of context tasks from multiple sources
covering both drugs and materials, and pretrain a 0.7-billion-parameter model
on it. Across 33 design tasks in six categories, DemoDiff matches or surpasses
language models 100-1000$\times$ larger and achieves an average rank of 3.63
compared to 5.25-10.20 for domain-specific approaches. These results position
DemoDiff as a molecular foundation model for in-context molecular design. Our
code is available at https://github.com/liugangcode/DemoDiff.

### [19] [RFOD: Random Forest-based Outlier Detection for Tabular Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08747)
*Yihao Ang,Peicheng Yao,Yifan Bao,Yushuo Feng,Qiang Huang,Anthony K. H. Tung,Zhiyong Huang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了RFOD框架，一种基于随机森林的表格数据异常检测方法，通过特征级条件重构处理混合类型数据，结合调整Gower距离和不确定性加权平均实现精确可解释的检测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有异常检测方法在处理混合类型表格数据时存在语义信息丢失和可解释性不足的问题，在网络安全、金融欺诈检测和医疗等高风险领域需要更有效的解决方案。

Method: 将异常检测重构为特征级条件重构问题，为每个特征训练专门的随机森林模型；使用调整Gower距离进行单元格级评分，结合不确定性加权平均聚合为行级异常分数。

Result: 在15个真实数据集上的实验表明，RFOD在检测准确率上持续优于最先进的基线方法，同时对混合类型表格数据具有更好的鲁棒性、可扩展性和可解释性。

Conclusion: RFOD框架有效解决了混合类型表格数据异常检测的挑战，在保持语义完整性的同时提供了精确且可解释的检测结果。

Abstract: Outlier detection in tabular data is crucial for safeguarding data integrity
in high-stakes domains such as cybersecurity, financial fraud detection, and
healthcare, where anomalies can cause serious operational and economic impacts.
Despite advances in both data mining and deep learning, many existing methods
struggle with mixed-type tabular data, often relying on encoding schemes that
lose important semantic information. Moreover, they frequently lack
interpretability, offering little insight into which specific values cause
anomalies. To overcome these challenges, we introduce \textsf{\textbf{RFOD}}, a
novel \textsf{\textbf{R}}andom \textsf{\textbf{F}}orest-based
\textsf{\textbf{O}}utlier \textsf{\textbf{D}}etection framework tailored for
tabular data. Rather than modeling a global joint distribution, \textsf{RFOD}
reframes anomaly detection as a feature-wise conditional reconstruction
problem, training dedicated random forests for each feature conditioned on the
others. This design robustly handles heterogeneous data types while preserving
the semantic integrity of categorical features. To further enable precise and
interpretable detection, \textsf{RFOD} combines Adjusted Gower's Distance (AGD)
for cell-level scoring, which adapts to skewed numerical data and accounts for
categorical confidence, with Uncertainty-Weighted Averaging (UWA) to aggregate
cell-level scores into robust row-level anomaly scores. Extensive experiments
on 15 real-world datasets demonstrate that \textsf{RFOD} consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in detection accuracy while offering
superior robustness, scalability, and interpretability for mixed-type tabular
data.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种控制优化确定性等价(OCE)风险的方法，扩展了传统的保形风险控制框架，能够处理尾部风险，并引入了端到端的保形风险训练方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习模型虽然预测准确率高，但缺乏可证明的风险或可靠性保证，这在高风险应用中至关重要。现有保形风险控制方法只能控制期望损失，无法处理对尾部风险敏感的实际应用。

Method: 开发了控制OCE风险类的方法，包括条件风险价值等尾部风险度量；引入了端到端的保形风险训练，在模型训练或微调期间通过保形OCE风险控制进行微分。

Result: 方法实现了可证明的风险保证，在控制分类器假阴性率和电池存储操作中的金融风险应用中，相比后处理方法显著提高了平均情况性能。

Conclusion: 提出的方法能够为深度学习模型提供可证明的风险保证，特别是对尾部风险的控制，同时通过端到端训练改善了平均性能。

Abstract: While deep learning models often achieve high predictive accuracy, their
predictions typically do not come with any provable guarantees on risk or
reliability, which are critical for deployment in high-stakes applications. The
framework of conformal risk control (CRC) provides a distribution-free,
finite-sample method for controlling the expected value of any bounded monotone
loss function and can be conveniently applied post-hoc to any pre-trained deep
learning model. However, many real-world applications are sensitive to tail
risks, as opposed to just expected loss. In this work, we develop a method for
controlling the general class of Optimized Certainty-Equivalent (OCE) risks, a
broad class of risk measures which includes as special cases the expected loss
(generalizing the original CRC method) and common tail risks like the
conditional value-at-risk (CVaR). Furthermore, standard post-hoc CRC can
degrade average-case performance due to its lack of feedback to the model. To
address this, we introduce "conformal risk training," an end-to-end approach
that differentiates through conformal OCE risk control during model training or
fine-tuning. Our method achieves provable risk guarantees while demonstrating
significantly improved average-case performance over post-hoc approaches on
applications to controlling classifiers' false negative rate and controlling
financial risk in battery storage operation.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一个联邦学习框架，用于量化跨样本记忆化风险，包括客户端内和客户端间记忆化，并通过实验揭示了影响记忆化的关键因素。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有联邦学习记忆化检测技术一次只能关注一个样本，低估了跨样本记忆化的风险，而集中式学习的细粒度记忆化评估方法无法直接应用于联邦学习。

Method: 提出了一个量化框架，使用细粒度跨样本记忆化测量来评估所有客户端中的客户端内和客户端间记忆化。

Result: 联邦学习模型确实会记忆客户端数据，特别是客户端内数据比客户端间数据更容易被记忆，记忆化程度受训练和推理因素的影响。

Conclusion: 联邦学习存在记忆化风险，特别是跨样本记忆化，需要开发更有效的检测和缓解方法来保护数据隐私。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables collaborative training without raw data
sharing, but still risks training data memorization. Existing FL memorization
detection techniques focus on one sample at a time, underestimating more subtle
risks of cross-sample memorization. In contrast, recent work on centralized
learning (CL) has introduced fine-grained methods to assess memorization across
all samples in training data, but these assume centralized access to data and
cannot be applied directly to FL. We bridge this gap by proposing a framework
that quantifies both intra- and inter-client memorization in FL using
fine-grained cross-sample memorization measurement across all clients. Based on
this framework, we conduct two studies: (1) measuring subtle memorization
across clients and (2) examining key factors that influence memorization,
including decoding strategies, prefix length, and FL algorithms. Our findings
reveal that FL models do memorize client data, particularly intra-client data,
more than inter-client data, with memorization influenced by training and
inferencing factors.

*Mujin Kwun,Depen Morwani,Chloe Huangyuan Su,Stephanie Gil,Nikhil Anand,Sham Kakade*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出LOTION框架，通过随机噪声平滑方法优化量化神经网络的训练，解决了量化目标梯度不连续的问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 量化神经网络优化面临根本挑战，因为量化器是分段常数函数，除了量化阈值处梯度未定义外，其他地方梯度为零。现有方法使用STE等技术放松梯度计算，但无法保证收敛性

Method: 受Nesterov平滑启发，提出LOTION框架，用无偏随机舍入噪声的期望来近似量化损失表面，将原始量化损失替换为连续损失表面

Result: 在该框架下，标准优化器保证收敛到损失表面的局部最小值。使用随机舍入噪声时，原始量化损失的全局最小值得以保留。实验表明该方法在合成测试集和150M/300M参数语言模型上优于标准QAT

Conclusion: LOTION提供了一个有原则的平滑框架，有效解决了量化神经网络优化的收敛性问题，并在实际应用中表现出优越性能

Abstract: Optimizing neural networks for quantized objectives is fundamentally
challenging because the quantizer is piece-wise constant, yielding zero
gradients everywhere except at quantization thresholds where the derivative is
undefined. Most existing methods deal with this issue by relaxing gradient
computations with techniques like Straight Through Estimators (STE) and do not
provide any guarantees of convergence. In this work, taking inspiration from
Nesterov smoothing, we approximate the quantized loss surface with a continuous
loss surface. In particular, we introduce LOTION, \textbf{L}ow-precision
\textbf{O}ptimization via s\textbf{T}ochastic-no\textbf{I}se
sm\textbf{O}othi\textbf{N}g, a principled smoothing framework that replaces the
raw quantized loss with its expectation under unbiased randomized-rounding
noise. In this framework, standard optimizers are guaranteed to converge to a
local minimum of the loss surface. Moreover, when using noise derived from
stochastic rounding, we show that the global minima of the original quantized
loss are preserved. We empirically demonstrate that this method outperforms
standard QAT on synthetic testbeds and on 150M- and 300M- parameter language
models.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出Spatial Deconfounder方法，通过将空间干扰转化为多原因信号，同时解决空间因果推断中的未测量混杂和干扰问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 空间因果推断面临两个交织挑战：未测量的空间混杂因素（如天气、污染）和附近处理的干扰效应。现有方法通常只解决其中一个而忽略另一个。

Method: 两阶段方法：使用具有空间先验的条件变分自编码器从局部处理向量重构替代混杂因子，然后通过灵活的结果模型估计因果效应。

Result: 在环境健康和社会科学真实数据集上，Spatial Deconfounder持续改进效应估计，扩展了SpaCE基准套件以包含处理干扰。

Conclusion: 通过将干扰转化为多原因信号，该框架连接了空间和去混杂文献，推进了结构化数据中的稳健因果推断。

Abstract: Causal inference in spatial domains faces two intertwined challenges: (1)
unmeasured spatial factors, such as weather, air pollution, or mobility, that
confound treatment and outcome, and (2) interference from nearby treatments
that violate standard no-interference assumptions. While existing methods
typically address one by assuming away the other, we show they are deeply
connected: interference reveals structure in the latent confounder. Leveraging
this insight, we propose the Spatial Deconfounder, a two-stage method that
reconstructs a substitute confounder from local treatment vectors using a
conditional variational autoencoder (CVAE) with a spatial prior, then estimates
causal effects via a flexible outcome model. We show that this approach enables
nonparametric identification of both direct and spillover effects under weak
assumptions--without requiring multiple treatment types or a known model of the
latent field. Empirically, we extend SpaCE, a benchmark suite for spatial
confounding, to include treatment interference, and show that the Spatial
Deconfounder consistently improves effect estimation across real-world datasets
in environmental health and social science. By turning interference into a
multi-cause signal, our framework bridges spatial and deconfounding literatures
to advance robust causal inference in structured data.

TL;DR: 结合虚拟成像工具与强化学习优化CT协议，在保证图像质量的同时显著减少计算步骤


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统CT协议优化方法需要穷举参数组合，计算成本高且不实用，需要更高效的优化方法

Method: 使用虚拟成像工具模拟人体肝脏病变模型，结合PPO强化学习算法优化CT采集和重建参数

Result: 强化学习方法在测试案例中达到了全局最大可检测性指数，比穷举搜索减少了79.7%的计算步骤

Conclusion: 虚拟成像工具与强化学习的结合为CT协议管理提供了准确且计算高效的解决方案

Abstract: Protocol optimization is critical in Computed Tomography (CT) to achieve high
diagnostic image quality while minimizing radiation dose. However, due to the
complex interdependencies among CT acquisition and reconstruction parameters,
traditional optimization methods rely on exhaustive testing of combinations of
these parameters, which is often impractical. This study introduces a novel
methodology that combines virtual imaging tools with reinforcement learning to
optimize CT protocols more efficiently. Human models with liver lesions were
imaged using a validated CT simulator and reconstructed with a novel CT
reconstruction toolkit. The optimization parameter space included tube voltage,
tube current, reconstruction kernel, slice thickness, and pixel size. The
optimization process was performed using a Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)
agent, which was trained to maximize an image quality objective, specifically
the detectability index (d') of liver lesions in the reconstructed images.
Optimization performance was compared against an exhaustive search performed on
a supercomputer. The proposed reinforcement learning approach achieved the
global maximum d' across test cases while requiring 79.7% fewer steps than the
exhaustive search, demonstrating both accuracy and computational efficiency.
The proposed framework is flexible and can accommodate various image quality
objectives. The findings highlight the potential of integrating virtual imaging
tools with reinforcement learning for CT protocol management.

TL;DR: 提出基于白金汉π定理的零样本迁移方法，通过无量纲缩放实现RL策略在不同物理参数环境中的泛化，无需重新训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决RL策略在新机器人、任务或不同物理参数环境中泛化能力差的问题，提升实际应用价值。

Method: 利用白金汉π定理将预训练策略的输入（观测）和输出（动作）缩放到无量纲空间，实现零样本迁移。

Result: 在三个复杂度递增的环境中验证：模拟钟摆、物理钟摆（sim-to-real验证）和高维HalfCheetah。缩放迁移在动态相似环境中无性能损失，在非相似环境中始终优于朴素迁移。

Conclusion: 量纲分析为增强RL策略的鲁棒性和泛化能力提供了强大实用的工具。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) policies often fail to generalize to new robots,
tasks, or environments with different physical parameters, a challenge that
limits their real-world applicability. This paper presents a simple, zero-shot
transfer method based on Buckingham's Pi Theorem to address this limitation.
The method adapts a pre-trained policy to new system contexts by scaling its
inputs (observations) and outputs (actions) through a dimensionless space,
requiring no retraining. The approach is evaluated against a naive transfer
baseline across three environments of increasing complexity: a simulated
pendulum, a physical pendulum for sim-to-real validation, and the
high-dimensional HalfCheetah. Results demonstrate that the scaled transfer
exhibits no loss of performance on dynamically similar contexts. Furthermore,
on non-similar contexts, the scaled policy consistently outperforms the naive
transfer, significantly expanding the volume of contexts where the original
policy remains effective. These findings demonstrate that dimensional analysis
provides a powerful and practical tool to enhance the robustness and
generalization of RL policies.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种在LLM内部编码过程中直接整合文本结构信息的新范式，通过顺序拼接和并行缓存两种方法生成结构感知的文本嵌入，在多个任务中优于仅使用文本和后处理聚合的方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM文本嵌入模型通常只处理原始文本，忽略了超链接、引用等丰富的结构信息，而这些结构信息在许多现实世界数据集中提供关键上下文。

Method: 研究了两种主要的内部处理方法：顺序拼接和并行缓存。还引入了上下文蒸馏和语义平衡两种技术来处理噪声结构数据。

Result: 在检索、聚类、分类和推荐任务的零样本实验中，结构感知方法始终优于仅文本和后处理基线。顺序拼接在噪声中等长度上下文中表现更好，而并行缓存在长高信号上下文中扩展性更强但更容易受干扰项影响。

Conclusion: 这项工作首次全面分析了内部结构感知编码，为构建更强大和上下文感知的嵌入模型提供了蓝图。

Abstract: Text embeddings from Large Language Models (LLMs) have become foundational
for numerous applications. However, these models typically operate on raw text,
overlooking the rich structural information, such as hyperlinks or citations,
that provides crucial context in many real-world datasets. This paper
introduces and systematically evaluates a new paradigm for generating
structure-aware text embeddings by integrating these structural relations
directly into the LLM's internal encoding process, rather than relying on
traditional post-hoc aggregation. We investigate two primary in-process
methods: sequential concatenation and parallel caching. Through extensive
zero-shot experiments across retrieval, clustering, classification, and
recommendation tasks, we demonstrate that our structure-aware approaches
consistently outperform both text-only and post-hoc baselines. Our analysis
reveals critical trade-offs: sequential concatenation excels with noisy,
moderate-length contexts, while parallel caching scales more effectively to
long, high-signal contexts but is more susceptible to distractors. To address
the challenge of noisy structural data, we also introduce and validate two
effective techniques: Context Distillation and Semantic Balancing. This work
provides the first comprehensive analysis of in-process structure-aware
encoding, offering a blueprint for building more powerful and contextually
aware embedding models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RL智能体在稀疏奖励环境中探索困难，而LLM具有程序性知识和推理能力，但现有方法过于刚性，需要RL策略必须遵循LLM建议或将其纳入奖励函数。

Method: 通过增强观察空间提供LLM生成的动作建议，允许RL智能体学习何时遵循或忽略这些指导，利用LLM的世界知识和推理能力，同时通过软约束保持灵活性。

Result: 在三个复杂度递增的BabyAI环境中评估，LLM指导的益处随任务难度而增加。在最挑战的环境中，最终成功率相对基线提升71%，样本效率提升高达9倍。

Conclusion: 该方法有效利用LLM规划能力加速RL在挑战性环境中的训练，无需修改现有RL算法。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) agents often struggle in sparse-reward
environments where traditional exploration strategies fail to discover
effective action sequences. Large Language Models (LLMs) possess procedural
knowledge and reasoning capabilities from text pretraining that could guide RL
exploration, but existing approaches create rigid dependencies where RL
policies must follow LLM suggestions or incorporate them directly into reward
functions. We propose a framework that provides LLM-generated action
recommendations through augmented observation spaces, allowing RL agents to
learn when to follow or ignore this guidance. Our method leverages LLMs' world
knowledge and reasoning abilities while maintaining flexibility through soft
constraints. We evaluate our approach on three BabyAI environments of
increasing complexity and show that the benefits of LLM guidance scale with
task difficulty. In the most challenging environment, we achieve 71% relative
improvement in final success rates over baseline. The approach provides
substantial sample efficiency gains, with agents reaching performance
thresholds up to 9 times faster, and requires no modifications to existing RL
algorithms. Our results demonstrate an effective method for leveraging LLM
planning capabilities to accelerate RL training in challenging environments.

Motivation: 解决神经网络函数逼近面临的三个主要挑战：每个目标函数需要从头训练新模型、性能对架构和超参数高度敏感、模型在训练域外泛化能力差。

Method: 首先训练基神经网络来逼近参考域上的多项式族，然后使用学习到的参数初始化更复杂目标函数的网络。引入域映射机制将任意域输入转换到参考域，保持与预训练模型的结构对应。

Result: 在一维和二维设置中的大量数值实验显示，该方法在训练效率、泛化性和模型可迁移性方面都有显著提升。

Conclusion: 基于初始化的策略为可扩展和模块化的神经函数逼近提供了有前景的解决方案。

Abstract: Neural network-based function approximation plays a pivotal role in the
advancement of scientific computing and machine learning. Yet, training such
models faces several challenges: (i) each target function often requires
training a new model from scratch; (ii) performance is highly sensitive to
architectural and hyperparameter choices; and (iii) models frequently
generalize poorly beyond the training domain. To overcome these challenges, we
propose a reusable initialization framework based on basis function
pretraining. In this approach, basis neural networks are first trained to
approximate families of polynomials on a reference domain. Their learned
parameters are then used to initialize networks for more complex target
functions. To enhance adaptability across arbitrary domains, we further
introduce a domain mapping mechanism that transforms inputs into the reference
domain, thereby preserving structural correspondence with the pretrained
models. Extensive numerical experiments in one- and two-dimensional settings
demonstrate substantial improvements in training efficiency, generalization,
and model transferability, highlighting the promise of initialization-based
strategies for scalable and modular neural function approximation. The full
code is made publicly available on Gitee.

TL;DR: 本文研究多臂老虎机中的欺骗性学习问题，代理在公共奖励约束下最大化私有奖励，同时避免被观察者检测到。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在现实应用中，代理可能需要在满足外部观察者期望的同时，追求自己的私有目标。本文旨在研究如何在Thompson Sampling框架下，既快速识别最佳私有臂，又不被观察者发现其欺骗行为。

Method: 将可检测性形式化为实际拉动概率与预期拉动概率之间的KL散度约束，将拉动公共次优臂建模为伯努利过程，提出基于公共和私有均值的极大极小问题，并设计受top-two算法启发的自适应算法。

Result: 在KL约束下，拉动公共次优臂最多只能以Θ(√T)的速率进行，并给出了最佳私有臂识别的最优错误指数特征。

Conclusion: 本文为欺骗性多臂老虎机问题提供了理论框架和实用算法，证明了在检测约束下私有目标优化的基本极限。

Abstract: We consider a multi-armed bandit setting in which each arm has a public and a
private reward distribution. An observer expects an agent to follow Thompson
Sampling according to the public rewards, however, the deceptive agent aims to
quickly identify the best private arm without being noticed. The observer can
observe the public rewards and the pulled arms, but not the private rewards.
The agent, on the other hand, observes both the public and private rewards. We
formalize detectability as a stepwise Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence
constraint between the actual pull probabilities used by the agent and the
anticipated pull probabilities by the observer. We model successful pulling of
public suboptimal arms as a % Bernoulli process where the success probability
decreases with each successful pull, and show these pulls can happen at most at
a $\Theta(\sqrt{T}) $ rate under the KL constraint. We then formulate a maximin
problem based on public and private means, whose solution characterizes the
optimal error exponent for best private arm identification. We finally propose
an algorithm inspired by top-two algorithms. This algorithm naturally adapts
its exploration according to the hardness of pulling arms based on the public
suboptimality gaps. We provide numerical examples illustrating the
$\Theta(\sqrt{T}) $ rate and the behavior of the proposed algorithm.

TL;DR: PO-CKAN是一个基于分块有理Kolmogorov-Arnold网络的物理信息深度算子框架，用于近似偏微分方程的解算子，相比PI-DeepONet在Burgers方程上减少了约48%的平均相对L2误差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发一个能够高效学习物理一致的时空解算子，并能快速预测参数化时变偏微分方程的框架，解决传统方法在物理一致性和计算效率方面的挑战。

Method: 采用DeepONet架构，结合分块有理Kolmogorov-Arnold网络(CKAN)子网络进行函数近似，并集成物理信息神经网络(PINNs)原理来强制物理一致性。

Result: 在Burgers方程(ν=0.01)上，PO-CKAN相比PI-DeepONet减少了约48%的平均相对L2误差，在Eikonal和扩散-反应基准测试中也达到了竞争性精度。

Conclusion: PO-CKAN框架能够准确学习算子，结果与高保真解高度匹配，证明了其在参数化时变偏微分方程求解中的有效性和优越性。

Abstract: We propose PO-CKAN, a physics-informed deep operator framework based on
Chunkwise Rational Kolmogorov--Arnold Networks (KANs), for approximating the
solution operators of partial differential equations. This framework leverages
a Deep Operator Network (DeepONet) architecture that incorporates Chunkwise
Rational Kolmogorov--Arnold Network (CKAN) sub-networks for enhanced function
approximation. The principles of Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) are
integrated into the operator learning framework to enforce physical
consistency. This design enables the efficient learning of physically
consistent spatio-temporal solution operators and allows for rapid prediction
for parametric time-dependent PDEs with varying inputs (e.g., parameters,
initial/boundary conditions) after training. Validated on challenging benchmark
problems, PO-CKAN demonstrates accurate operator learning with results closely
matching high-fidelity solutions. PO-CKAN adopts a DeepONet-style branch--trunk
architecture with its sub-networks instantiated as rational KAN modules, and
enforces physical consistency via a PDE residual (PINN-style) loss. On Burgers'
equation with $\nu=0.01$, PO-CKAN reduces the mean relative $L^2$ error by
approximately 48\% compared to PI-DeepONet, and achieves competitive accuracy
on the Eikonal and diffusion--reaction benchmarks.

Motivation: AI攻击LWE在某些参数设置下优于传统攻击，但缺乏可访问数据限制了AI实践者研究和改进这些攻击。创建LWE数据耗时且需要专业知识。

Conclusion: TAPAS数据集填补了AI研究LWE攻击的数据空白，将加速后量子密码学的AI研究进展。

Abstract: AI-powered attacks on Learning with Errors (LWE), an important hard math
problem in post-quantum cryptography, rival or outperform "classical" attacks
on LWE under certain parameter settings. Despite the promise of this approach,
a dearth of accessible data limits AI practitioners' ability to study and
improve these attacks. Creating LWE data for AI model training is time- and
compute-intensive and requires significant domain expertise. To fill this gap
and accelerate AI research on LWE attacks, we propose the TAPAS datasets, a
Toolkit for Analysis of Post-quantum cryptography using AI Systems. These
datasets cover several LWE settings and can be used off-the-shelf by AI
practitioners to prototype new approaches to cracking LWE. This work documents
TAPAS dataset creation, establishes attack performance baselines, and lays out
directions for future work.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在线教育中理解学习者情绪对提高参与度和个性化教学至关重要。现有情感识别方法通常采用静态融合策略，并假设模态输入始终可靠，这在真实学习环境中很少成立。

Method: 模型包含三个关键组件：跨模态注意力对齐模块用于动态跨模态上下文共享，模态重要性估计器为每个时间步的每个模态分配基于置信度的权重，时间反馈循环利用先前预测来强制时间一致性。

Result: 在IEMOCAP和MOSEI的教育子集上评估，Edu-EmotionNet实现了最先进的性能，并对缺失或噪声模态表现出强大的鲁棒性。可视化证实其能够捕捉情感转换并自适应地优先考虑可靠信号。

Conclusion: 该框架非常适合部署在实时学习系统中，能够有效识别学习者的困惑、好奇、无聊和沮丧等情绪状态。

Abstract: Understanding learner emotions in online education is critical for improving
engagement and personalized instruction. While prior work in emotion
recognition has explored multimodal fusion and temporal modeling, existing
methods often rely on static fusion strategies and assume that modality inputs
are consistently reliable, which is rarely the case in real-world learning
environments. We introduce Edu-EmotionNet, a novel framework that jointly
models temporal emotion evolution and modality reliability for robust affect
recognition. Our model incorporates three key components: a Cross-Modality
Attention Alignment (CMAA) module for dynamic cross-modal context sharing, a
Modality Importance Estimator (MIE) that assigns confidence-based weights to
each modality at every time step, and a Temporal Feedback Loop (TFL) that
leverages previous predictions to enforce temporal consistency. Evaluated on
educational subsets of IEMOCAP and MOSEI, re-annotated for confusion,
curiosity, boredom, and frustration, Edu-EmotionNet achieves state-of-the-art
performance and demonstrates strong robustness to missing or noisy modalities.
Visualizations confirm its ability to capture emotional transitions and
adaptively prioritize reliable signals, making it well suited for deployment in
real-time learning systems

Result: 通过LoRA微调在所有评估指标上获得一致改进，小型语言模型展现出对图结构数据的非平凡推理能力。

Conclusion: 小型语言模型具备图结构推理能力，可通过高效参数调优有效适应结构推理任务。

Abstract: Graphs provide a universal framework for representing complex relational
systems, and inferring their structural properties is a core challenge in graph
analysis and reasoning. While large language models have recently demonstrated
emerging abilities to perform symbolic and numerical reasoning, the potential
of smaller, resource-efficient models in this context remains largely
unexplored. This paper investigates whether compact transformer-based language
models can infer graph-theoretic parameters directly from textual graph
representations. To enable systematic evaluation, we introduce the
TinyGraphEstimator dataset - a balanced collection of connected graphs
generated from multiple random graph models and annotated with detailed
structural metadata. We evaluate several small open models on their ability to
predict key graph parameters such as density, clustering, and chromatic number.
Furthermore, we apply lightweight fine-tuning using the Low-Rank Adaptation
(LoRA) technique, achieving consistent improvements across all evaluated
metrics. The results demonstrate that small language models possess non-trivial
reasoning capacity over graph-structured data and can be effectively adapted
for structural inference tasks through efficient parameter tuning.

<details>

Motivation: 现实世界数据分布往往存在不平衡（长尾）特性，这导致深度分类模型偏向频繁类别，对尾部类别表现不佳。

Method: 两阶段方法：第一阶段从信息理论角度提出新的表示学习技术，理论上等价于最小化类内距离；第二阶段开发新颖的采样策略，选择数学信息丰富的实例来修正多数偏向的决策边界。

Result: 在多个长尾基准数据集上实现了最先进的性能，通过广泛实验验证。

Conclusion: 该方法能有效缓解多数偏向趋势，同时保留数据集中的有价值信息，在长尾分类问题上表现优异。

Abstract: The imbalance (or long-tail) is the nature of many real-world data
distributions, which often induces the undesirable bias of deep classification
models toward frequent classes, resulting in poor performance for tail classes.
In this paper, we propose a novel two-stage learning approach to mitigate such
a majority-biased tendency while preserving valuable information within
datasets. Specifically, the first stage proposes a new representation learning
technique from the information theory perspective. This approach is
theoretically equivalent to minimizing intra-class distance, yielding an
effective and well-separated feature space. The second stage develops a novel
sampling strategy that selects mathematically informative instances, able to
rectify majority-biased decision boundaries without compromising a model's
overall performance. As a result, our approach achieves the state-of-the-art
performance across various long-tailed benchmark datasets, validated via
extensive experiments. Our code is available at

Motivation: 现有公平性方法主要关注医学图像诊断任务，忽视了预后场景中的时间到事件预测，需要填补这一研究空白。

Method: 整合先进的TTE预测和公平性算法，采用因果分析技术系统分析医学影像预后中的公平性问题。

Result: 大规模评估显示偏见在不同成像模态中普遍存在，现有公平性方法缓解效果有限，分布偏移下公平性更难维持。

Conclusion: 需要针对所有偏见形式的整体方法，开发更稳健、公平的预后模型，现有解决方案在分布偏移下存在局限性。

Abstract: As machine learning (ML) algorithms are increasingly used in medical image
analysis, concerns have emerged about their potential biases against certain
social groups. Although many approaches have been proposed to ensure the
fairness of ML models, most existing works focus only on medical image
diagnosis tasks, such as image classification and segmentation, and overlooked
prognosis scenarios, which involve predicting the likely outcome or progression
of a medical condition over time. To address this gap, we introduce FairTTE,
the first comprehensive framework for assessing fairness in time-to-event (TTE)
prediction in medical imaging. FairTTE encompasses a diverse range of imaging
modalities and TTE outcomes, integrating cutting-edge TTE prediction and
fairness algorithms to enable systematic and fine-grained analysis of fairness
in medical image prognosis. Leveraging causal analysis techniques, FairTTE
uncovers and quantifies distinct sources of bias embedded within medical
imaging datasets. Our large-scale evaluation reveals that bias is pervasive
across different imaging modalities and that current fairness methods offer
limited mitigation. We further demonstrate a strong association between
underlying bias sources and model disparities, emphasizing the need for
holistic approaches that target all forms of bias. Notably, we find that
fairness becomes increasingly difficult to maintain under distribution shifts,
underscoring the limitations of existing solutions and the pressing need for
more robust, equitable prognostic models.

TL;DR: 本文分析了自监督对比学习(CL)与仅负样本监督对比学习(NSCL)在表示层面的对齐性，证明了在共享随机性条件下，两者的相似性矩阵保持相近，但参数空间耦合不稳定。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有理论表明CL损失近似于NSCL损失，但这种损失层面的相似性是否意味着表示层面也保持对齐是一个开放问题。

Method: 在共享随机性条件下训练CL和NSCL模型，分析其表示相似性矩阵的接近程度，并证明参数空间耦合的不稳定性。

Result: CL和NSCL的表示保持相似，相似性矩阵在现实条件下保持接近，且对齐性随类别数、温度增加而改善，但参数空间耦合会随时间指数级发散。

Conclusion: NSCL可作为自监督与监督学习之间的原则性桥梁，CL-NSCL对齐性随规模和温度增强，NSCL比其它监督目标更接近CL。

Abstract: Self-supervised contrastive learning (CL) has achieved remarkable empirical
success, often producing representations that rival supervised pre-training on
downstream tasks. Recent theory explains this by showing that the CL loss
closely approximates a supervised surrogate, Negatives-Only Supervised
Contrastive Learning (NSCL) loss, as the number of classes grows. Yet this
loss-level similarity leaves an open question: {\em Do CL and NSCL also remain
aligned at the representation level throughout training, not just in their
objectives?}
  We address this by analyzing the representation alignment of CL and NSCL
models trained under shared randomness (same initialization, batches, and
augmentations). First, we show that their induced representations remain
similar: specifically, we prove that the similarity matrices of CL and NSCL
stay close under realistic conditions. Our bounds provide high-probability
guarantees on alignment metrics such as centered kernel alignment (CKA) and
representational similarity analysis (RSA), and they clarify how alignment
improves with more classes, higher temperatures, and its dependence on batch
size. In contrast, we demonstrate that parameter-space coupling is inherently
unstable: divergence between CL and NSCL weights can grow exponentially with
training time.
  Finally, we validate these predictions empirically, showing that CL-NSCL
alignment strengthens with scale and temperature, and that NSCL tracks CL more
closely than other supervised objectives. This positions NSCL as a principled
bridge between self-supervised and supervised learning. Our code and project

TL;DR: 提出自适应时间掩码(ATM)方法来解决稀疏自编码器训练中的特征吸收问题，通过动态调整特征选择来学习更稳定的可解释特征


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前稀疏自编码器训练方法存在特征吸收问题，特征相互吸收以最小化L1惩罚，导致难以一致识别和分析模型行为

Method: ATM通过跟踪激活幅度、频率和重构贡献来计算随时间演化的重要性分数，基于统计阈值应用概率掩码机制进行特征选择

Result: 在Gemma-2-2b模型上的实验表明，ATM相比TopK和JumpReLU SAEs实现了显著更低的吸收分数，同时保持优秀的重构质量

Conclusion: ATM为学习稳定、可解释的神经网络特征提供了原则性解决方案，为更可靠的模型分析奠定了基础

Abstract: Understanding the internal representations of large language models is
crucial for ensuring their reliability and safety, with sparse autoencoders
(SAEs) emerging as a promising interpretability approach. However, current SAE
training methods face feature absorption, where features (or neurons) are
absorbed into each other to minimize $L_1$ penalty, making it difficult to
consistently identify and analyze model behaviors. We introduce Adaptive
Temporal Masking (ATM), a novel training approach that dynamically adjusts
feature selection by tracking activation magnitudes, frequencies, and
reconstruction contributions to compute importance scores that evolve over
time. ATM applies a probabilistic masking mechanism based on statistical
thresholding of these importance scores, creating a more natural feature
selection process. Through extensive experiments on the Gemma-2-2b model, we
demonstrate that ATM achieves substantially lower absorption scores compared to
existing methods like TopK and JumpReLU SAEs, while maintaining excellent
reconstruction quality. These results establish ATM as a principled solution
for learning stable, interpretable features in neural networks, providing a
foundation for more reliable model analysis.

Motivation: 探索为什么在单任务训练的深度神经网络能够很好地建模整个视觉系统，尽管人类视觉皮层中的腹侧、背侧和外侧通路涉及不同的功能过程。

Method: 应用稀疏分解方法识别各视觉通路的主导表征组件，并引入稀疏组件对齐(SCA)方法来测量大脑与机器之间的表征对齐。

Result: 发现各视觉通路的组件响应特征存在明显差异：腹侧通路对脸、地点、身体、文字和食物敏感；外侧通路对社会互动、隐含运动和手部动作敏感；背侧通路则包含一些较难解释的组件。SCA显示标准视觉DNN与腹侧通路的对齐度高于背侧或外侧通路。

Conclusion: SCA方法能够比传统群体水平几何方法更精确地揭示大脑与机器视觉系统之间的表征对齐差异，提供了对系统潜在神经调谐轴的敏感测量。

Abstract: The ventral, dorsal, and lateral streams in high-level human visual cortex
are implicated in distinct functional processes. Yet, deep neural networks
(DNNs) trained on a single task model the entire visual system surprisingly
well, hinting at common computational principles across these pathways. To
explore this inconsistency, we applied a novel sparse decomposition approach to
identify the dominant components of visual representations within each stream.
Consistent with traditional neuroscience research, we find a clear difference
in component response profiles across the three visual streams -- identifying
components selective for faces, places, bodies, text, and food in the ventral
stream; social interactions, implied motion, and hand actions in the lateral
stream; and some less interpretable components in the dorsal stream. Building
on this, we introduce Sparse Component Alignment (SCA), a new method for
measuring representational alignment between brains and machines that better
captures the latent neural tuning of these two visual systems. Using SCA, we
find that standard visual DNNs are more aligned with the ventral than either
dorsal or lateral representations. SCA reveals these distinctions with greater
resolution than conventional population-level geometry, offering a measure of
representational alignment that is sensitive to a system's underlying axes of
neural tuning.

Abstract: Many science and engineering problems rely on expensive computational
simulations, where a multi-fidelity approach can accelerate the exploration of
a parameter space. We study efficient allocation of a simulation budget using a
Gaussian Process (GP) model in the binary simulation output case. This paper
introduces Bernoulli Parameter Mutual Information (BPMI), a batch active
learning algorithm for multi-fidelity GP classifiers. BPMI circumvents the
intractability of calculating mutual information in the probability space by
employing a first-order Taylor expansion of the link function. We evaluate BPMI
against several baselines on two synthetic test cases and a complex, real-world
application involving the simulation of a laser-ignited rocket combustor. In
all experiments, BPMI demonstrates superior performance, achieving higher
predictive accuracy for a fixed computational budget.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于乐观DEC的方法只能处理随机环境，无法扩展到对抗性环境。需要一种模型自由的方法来消除乐观主义，通过纯信息增益驱动探索，从而在更广泛的环境中实现更好的性能。

Method: 引入Dig-DEC，这是一种基于信息增益的模型自由决策估计系数。它通过信息增益而非乐观主义来驱动探索，适用于对抗性环境。同时改进了在线函数估计过程，包括平均估计误差最小化和贝尔曼完备MDP中的平方误差最小化。

Result: Dig-DEC始终不大于乐观DEC，在某些情况下可以小得多。在混合MDP中获得了首个模型自由遗憾边界，解决了Liu等人(2025)留下的主要开放问题。在贝尔曼完备MDP中，遗憾边界从T^{2/3}改进到√T，首次与基于乐观主义的方法性能匹配。

Conclusion: Dig-DEC提供了一种有效的模型自由方法，通过信息增益驱动探索，在随机和对抗性环境中都表现出色，解决了现有方法的局限性，并在多个设置中实现了最先进的遗憾边界。

Abstract: We study decision making with structured observation (DMSO). Previous work
(Foster et al., 2021b, 2023a) has characterized the complexity of DMSO via the
decision-estimation coefficient (DEC), but left a gap between the regret upper
and lower bounds that scales with the size of the model class. To tighten this
gap, Foster et al. (2023b) introduced optimistic DEC, achieving a bound that
scales only with the size of the value-function class. However, their
optimism-based exploration is only known to handle the stochastic setting, and
it remains unclear whether it extends to the adversarial setting.
  We introduce Dig-DEC, a model-free DEC that removes optimism and drives
exploration purely by information gain. Dig-DEC is always no larger than
optimistic DEC and can be much smaller in special cases. Importantly, the
removal of optimism allows it to handle adversarial environments without
explicit reward estimators. By applying Dig-DEC to hybrid MDPs with stochastic
transitions and adversarial rewards, we obtain the first model-free regret
bounds for hybrid MDPs with bandit feedback under several general transition
structures, resolving the main open problem left by Liu et al. (2025).
  We also improve the online function-estimation procedure in model-free
learning: For average estimation error minimization, we refine the estimator in
Foster et al. (2023b) to achieve sharper concentration, improving their regret
bounds from $T^{3/4}$ to $T^{2/3}$ (on-policy) and from $T^{5/6}$ to $T^{7/9}$
(off-policy). For squared error minimization in Bellman-complete MDPs, we
redesign their two-timescale procedure, improving the regret bound from
$T^{2/3}$ to $\sqrt{T}$. This is the first time a DEC-based method achieves
performance matching that of optimism-based approaches (Jin et al., 2021; Xie
et al., 2023) in Bellman-complete MDPs.

Result: 在AIME、MATH和AMC等具有挑战性的基准测试中，ACPO显著优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: ACPO通过平衡探索与利用，有效解决了RLVR中的关键问题，为复杂推理任务提供了更优的解决方案。

Abstract: While Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) enhances complex
reasoning in LLMs, current methods struggle to balance exploration and
exploitation. This leads to critical issues like inaccurate credit assignment
for intermediate steps and premature entropy collapse, limiting model
performance. To address this, we introduce Attribution-based Contribution to
Policy Optimization (ACPO), a phased framework that incorporates a
difficulty-aware curriculum. ACPO improves exploration by using trajectory
semantic segmentation and an attribution-based representation to dynamically
regulate policy entropy, thus mitigating its collapse. Concurrently, it
enhances exploitation with a factorized reward system that precisely quantifies
the hierarchical contribution of each reasoning step, ensuring accurate credit
assignment. Extensive experiments on challenging benchmarks, including AIME,
MATH, and AMC, demonstrate that ACPO significantly outperforms existing
state-of-the-art approaches.

the trade-off between exploration and exploitation. Although algorithms such as
Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) and Thompson Sampling, along with their regret
theories, are well-established, existing analyses primarily operate from a
time-domain and cumulative regret perspective, struggling to characterize the
dynamic nature of the learning process. This paper proposes a novel
frequency-domain analysis framework, reformulating the bandit process as a
signal processing problem. Within this framework, the reward estimate of each
arm is viewed as a spectral component, with its uncertainty corresponding to
the component's frequency, and the bandit algorithm is interpreted as an
adaptive filter. We construct a formal Frequency-Domain Bandit Model and prove
the main theorem: the confidence bound term in the UCB algorithm is equivalent
in the frequency domain to a time-varying gain applied to uncertain spectral
components, a gain inversely proportional to the square root of the visit
count. Based on this, we further derive finite-time dynamic bounds concerning
the exploration rate decay. This theory not only provides a novel and intuitive
physical interpretation for classical algorithms but also lays a rigorous
theoretical foundation for designing next-generation algorithms with adaptive
parameter adjustment.

TL;DR: 提出基于LLM和DDPG的优化方法，解决车联网中SPS调度导致的AoI恶化问题，通过双路径优化方案降低信息年龄。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决车联网半持续调度中因数据包碰撞和车辆速度相关信道不确定性导致的信息年龄恶化问题。

Method: 建立受车辆速度、密度和资源预留间隔影响的AoI计算模型，设计双路径优化方案：DDPG基于状态空间和奖励函数进行优化，LLM利用上下文学习生成最优参数配置。

Result: 实验结果显示，LLM在积累少量样本后无需模型训练即可显著降低AoI，而DDPG方法在训练后能获得更稳定的性能。

Conclusion: LLM和DDPG的双路径优化方法能有效改善车联网中的信息年龄性能，LLM具有快速部署优势，DDPG提供稳定性能。

Abstract: Addressing the problem of Age of Information (AoI) deterioration caused by
packet collisions and vehicle speed-related channel uncertainties in
Semi-Persistent Scheduling (SPS) for the Internet of Vehicles (IoV), this
letter proposes an optimization approach based on Large Language Models (LLM)
and Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG). First, an AoI calculation model
influenced by vehicle speed, vehicle density, and Resource Reservation Interval
(RRI) is established, followed by the design of a dual-path optimization
scheme. The DDPG is guided by the state space and reward function, while the
LLM leverages contextual learning to generate optimal parameter configurations.
Experimental results demonstrate that LLM can significantly reduce AoI after
accumulating a small number of exemplars without requiring model training,
whereas the DDPG method achieves more stable performance after training.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出一种简单鲁棒的方法，用于时空相关的小地球数据预测，通过量化时空模式并利用表格基础模型，在不同场景下实现准确预测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 小地球数据具有有限的短期监测变异性，提供稀疏但有意义的测量，通常表现出时空相关性。传统深度学习模型需要针对不同场景进行特定任务训练，而基础模型虽然无需特定训练，但往往对预训练分布的全局均值存在预测偏差。

Method: 该方法的核心思想是表征和量化小地球数据的时空模式，然后利用表格基础模型进行跨不同场景的准确预测。

Result: 在三个典型场景的比较结果显示，该方法在大多数情况下比图深度学习模型（T-GCN）和表格基础模型（TabPFN）实现了更优的准确性，表现出更强的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 提出的方法为时空相关的小地球数据预测提供了一种简单而鲁棒的解决方案，能够在不同场景下实现准确预测，且比现有方法具有更好的性能。

Abstract: Small Earth data are geoscience observations with limited short-term
monitoring variability, providing sparse but meaningful measurements, typically
exhibiting spatiotemporal correlations. Spatiotemporal forecasting on such data
is crucial for understanding geoscientific processes despite their small scale.
However, conventional deep learning models for spatiotemporal forecasting
requires task-specific training for different scenarios. Foundation models do
not need task-specific training, but they often exhibit forecasting bias toward
the global mean of the pretraining distribution. Here we propose a simple and
robust approach for spatiotemporally correlated small Earth data forecasting.
The essential idea is to characterize and quantify spatiotemporal patterns of
small Earth data and then utilize tabular foundation models for accurate
forecasting across different scenarios. Comparative results across three
typical scenarios demonstrate that our forecasting approach achieves superior
accuracy compared to the graph deep learning model (T-GCN) and tabular
foundation model (TabPFN) in the majority of instances, exhibiting stronger
robustness.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统PINNs在处理多尺度问题时的局限性，通过动态域分解来更好地捕捉解的不同尺度特征，避免陷入局部极小值并减少超参数调优需求。

Method: 基于经典网格细化技术，在训练过程中动态调整域分解：现有子域自适应调整以匹配解的特征，同时在残差损失高的区域引入新的子域以增强表达能力。

Result: AB-PINNs在多种复杂多尺度偏微分方程求解中表现出有效性，能够更好地捕捉解的多尺度特征。

Conclusion: AB-PINNs提供了一种灵活的域分解方法，特别适用于多尺度问题，能够动态适应解的特征并提高训练效率和准确性。

Abstract: We introduce adaptive-basis physics-informed neural networks (AB-PINNs), a
novel approach to domain decomposition for training PINNs in which existing
subdomains dynamically adapt to the intrinsic features of the unknown solution.
Drawing inspiration from classical mesh refinement techniques, we also modify
the domain decomposition on-the-fly throughout training by introducing new
subdomains in regions of high residual loss, thereby providing additional
expressive power where the solution of the differential equation is challenging
to represent. Our flexible approach to domain decomposition is well-suited for
multiscale problems, as different subdomains can learn to capture different
scales of the underlying solution. Moreover, the ability to introduce new
subdomains during training helps prevent convergence to unwanted local minima
and can reduce the need for extensive hyperparameter tuning compared to static
domain decomposition approaches. Throughout, we present comprehensive numerical
results which demonstrate the effectiveness of AB-PINNs at solving a variety of
complex multiscale partial differential equations.

TL;DR: 提出MATT方法，通过置信度引导的多推理路径生成来提升CTR模型在推理阶段的预测性能，解决罕见特征组合导致的低置信度问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注CTR模型的训练阶段优化，忽略了推理阶段的改进机会。罕见特征组合会降低预测性能，导致不可靠输出

Method: 使用分层概率哈希方法估计特征组合的出现频率作为置信度分数，以置信度为采样概率生成多个实例特定的推理路径，然后聚合多个路径的预测分数进行鲁棒预测

Result: 离线和在线A/B测试验证了MATT在现有CTR模型上的兼容性和有效性

Conclusion: MATT是一种模型无关的测试时优化方法，能够有效提升CTR模型的预测性能

Abstract: Recently, a growing body of research has focused on either optimizing CTR
model architectures to better model feature interactions or refining training
objectives to aid parameter learning, thereby achieving better predictive
performance. However, previous efforts have primarily focused on the training
phase, largely neglecting opportunities for optimization during the inference
phase. Infrequently occurring feature combinations, in particular, can degrade
prediction performance, leading to unreliable or low-confidence outputs. To
unlock the predictive potential of trained CTR models, we propose a
Model-Agnostic Test-Time paradigm (MATT), which leverages the confidence scores
of feature combinations to guide the generation of multiple inference paths,
thereby mitigating the influence of low-confidence features on the final
prediction. Specifically, to quantify the confidence of feature combinations,
we introduce a hierarchical probabilistic hashing method to estimate the
occurrence frequencies of feature combinations at various orders, which serve
as their corresponding confidence scores. Then, using the confidence scores as
sampling probabilities, we generate multiple instance-specific inference paths
through iterative sampling and subsequently aggregate the prediction scores
from multiple paths to conduct robust predictions. Finally, extensive offline
experiments and online A/B tests strongly validate the compatibility and
effectiveness of MATT across existing CTR models.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了Meta-Policy Controller (MPC)动态元学习框架，通过双层优化自适应调整KL散度系数和Dirichlet先验强度，解决传统EDL方法在动态数据分布中校准能力不足的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统证据深度学习(EDL)方法依赖静态超参数进行不确定性校准，在动态数据分布中适应性差，导致高风险决策任务中校准和泛化性能不佳。

Method: 采用双层优化方法：内层循环通过动态配置的损失函数更新模型参数；外层循环通过策略网络基于多目标奖励优化KL散度系数和类别特定的Dirichlet先验强度。

Result: 实验结果表明MPC显著提升了模型预测的可靠性和校准性，在不确定性校准、预测准确性和基于置信度的样本剔除后性能保持方面都有明显改善。

Conclusion: MPC框架通过动态调整不确定性建模参数，有效解决了传统EDL方法的局限性，为高风险决策任务提供了更可靠的预测不确定性估计。

Abstract: Traditional Evidence Deep Learning (EDL) methods rely on static
hyperparameter for uncertainty calibration, limiting their adaptability in
dynamic data distributions, which results in poor calibration and
generalization in high-risk decision-making tasks. To address this limitation,
we propose the Meta-Policy Controller (MPC), a dynamic meta-learning framework
that adjusts the KL divergence coefficient and Dirichlet prior strengths for
optimal uncertainty modeling. Specifically, MPC employs a bi-level optimization
approach: in the inner loop, model parameters are updated through a dynamically
configured loss function that adapts to the current training state; in the
outer loop, a policy network optimizes the KL divergence coefficient and
class-specific Dirichlet prior strengths based on multi-objective rewards
balancing prediction accuracy and uncertainty quality. Unlike previous methods
with fixed priors, our learnable Dirichlet prior enables flexible adaptation to
class distributions and training dynamics. Extensive experimental results show
that MPC significantly enhances the reliability and calibration of model
predictions across various tasks, improving uncertainty calibration, prediction
accuracy, and performance retention after confidence-based sample rejection.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界时间序列数据存在非平稳行为、机制转换和时间变化噪声等问题，这些会降低标准回归模型的鲁棒性。

Method: VARNN在传统前馈预测器基础上增加学习误差记忆状态，该状态从短期上下文步骤的残差中更新，作为变异性和漂移的信号，然后调节当前时间步的最终预测。

Result: 在多个领域数据集上的实验表明，VARNN在测试MSE上表现优异，计算开销最小，优于静态、动态和循环基线模型。

Conclusion: VARNN模型在漂移和波动环境下提供鲁棒预测，是时间序列学习的有前景框架。

Abstract: Real-world time series data exhibit non-stationary behavior, regime shifts,
and temporally varying noise (heteroscedastic) that degrade the robustness of
standard regression models. We introduce the Variability-Aware Recursive Neural
Network (VARNN), a novel residual-aware architecture for supervised time-series
regression that learns an explicit error memory from recent prediction
residuals and uses it to recalibrate subsequent predictions. VARNN augments a
feed-forward predictor with a learned error-memory state that is updated from
residuals over a short context steps as a signal of variability and drift, and
then conditions the final prediction at the current time step. Across diverse
dataset domains, appliance energy, healthcare, and environmental monitoring,
experimental results demonstrate VARNN achieves superior performance and
attains lower test MSE with minimal computational overhead over static,
dynamic, and recurrent baselines. Our findings show that the VARNN model offers
robust predictions under a drift and volatility environment, highlighting its
potential as a promising framework for time-series learning.

Method: 提出LAGA多智能体框架，包含检测、规划、行动和评估四个协作智能体，其中行动智能体采用双编码器和三目标设计来捕获跨模态互补信息并进行整体图质量增强。

Result: 在九种场景下的实验表明，LAGA显著改善了图质量，并在各种任务和骨干网络上实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 数据为中心的质量优化是实现可靠文本属性图和鲁棒图学习的关键。

Abstract: Text-attributed graphs (TAGs) have emerged as a powerful representation that
combines structural connections with fine-grained semantics, supporting a wide
range of data-centric applications. However, the performance of graph neural
networks (GNNs) on TAGs is highly sensitive to input quality. Our empirical
study shows that both traditional GNNs and LLM-enhanced GNNs suffer significant
degradation across nine representative scenarios of sparsity, noise, and
imbalance, highlighting graph quality as a critical bottleneck. Existing
approaches mainly focus on improving model architectures, while neglecting
systematic optimization of TAG data itself, leading to limited effectiveness in
practice. To address this gap, we propose LAGA (Large Language and Graph
Agent), a unified multi-agent framework that treats graph quality control as a
first-class, data-centric problem. LAGA integrates four collaborative
agents-detection, planning, action, and evaluation-into an automated closed
loop. At its core, the action agent employs a dual-encoder and tri-objective
design to capture complementary information across modalities and perform
holistic graph quality enhancement. Experiments across nine scenarios show that
LAGA improves graph quality and achieves state-of-the-art performance across
various tasks and backbones, validating data-centric quality optimization as
key to reliable TAGs and robust graph learning.

Abstract: Learning with high-resource data has demonstrated substantial success in
artificial intelligence (AI); however, the costs associated with data
annotation and model training remain significant. A fundamental objective of AI
research is to achieve robust generalization with limited-resource data. This
survey employs agnostic active sampling theory within the Probably
Approximately Correct (PAC) framework to analyze the generalization error and
label complexity associated with learning from low-resource data in both
model-agnostic supervised and unsupervised settings. Based on this analysis, we
investigate a suite of optimization strategies tailored for low-resource data
learning, including gradient-informed optimization, meta-iteration
optimization, geometry-aware optimization, and LLMs-powered optimization.
Furthermore, we provide a comprehensive overview of multiple learning paradigms
that can benefit from low-resource data, including domain transfer,
reinforcement feedback, and hierarchical structure modeling. Finally, we
conclude our analysis and investigation by summarizing the key findings and
highlighting their implications for learning with low-resource data.

Abstract: Bayesian Optimisation (BO) is a powerful tool for optimising expensive
blackbox functions but its effectiveness diminishes in highdimensional spaces
due to sparse data and poor surrogate model scalability While Variational
Autoencoder (VAE) based approaches address this by learning low-dimensional
latent representations the reconstructionbased objective function often brings
the functional distribution mismatch between the latent space and original
space leading to suboptimal optimisation performance In this paper we first
analyse the reason why reconstructiononly loss may lead to distribution
mismatch and then propose HiBBO a novel BO framework that introduces the space
consistency into the latent space construction in VAE using HiPPO - a method
for longterm sequence modelling - to reduce the functional distribution
mismatch between the latent space and original space Experiments on
highdimensional benchmark tasks demonstrate that HiBBO outperforms existing
VAEBO methods in convergence speed and solution quality Our work bridges the
gap between high-dimensional sequence representation learning and efficient
Bayesian Optimisation enabling broader applications in neural architecture

Conclusion: 学习优化器能够固有地学习正则化特性，挑战了传统显式优化目标正则化的必要性。

Abstract: Learned Optimizers (LOs), a type of Meta-learning, have gained traction due
to their ability to be parameterized and trained for efficient optimization.
Traditional gradient-based methods incorporate explicit regularization
techniques such as Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM), Gradient-norm Aware
Minimization (GAM), and Gap-guided Sharpness-Aware Minimization (GSAM) to
enhance generalization and convergence. In this work, we explore a fundamental
question: \textbf{Can regularizers be learned?} We empirically demonstrate that
LOs can be trained to learn and internalize the effects of traditional
regularization techniques without explicitly applying them to the objective
function. We validate this through extensive experiments on standard benchmarks
(including MNIST, FMNIST, CIFAR and Neural Networks such as MLP, MLP-Relu and
CNN), comparing LOs trained with and without access to explicit regularizers.
Regularized LOs consistently outperform their unregularized counterparts in
terms of test accuracy and generalization. Furthermore, we show that LOs retain
and transfer these regularization effects to new optimization tasks by
inherently seeking minima similar to those targeted by these regularizers. Our
results suggest that LOs can inherently learn regularization properties,
\textit{challenging the conventional necessity of explicit optimizee loss
regularization.

Motivation: 为了解决RLIR在无标注设置下性能不稳定和偏差累积的问题，特别是模型倾向于高估高置信度轨迹导致的偏差估计。

Method: 提出RLER方法，通过集成多个模型、自适应奖励插值和轨迹选择来缓解系统偏差。

Result: RLER相比RLIR提升了13.6%，仅比RLVR低3.6%，在无标注样本上实现了稳定的扩展。

Conclusion: RLER有效缓解了RLIR中的系统偏差问题，在无标注设置下实现了接近RLVR的性能，具有很高的应用价值。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) scales the reasoning
ability of large language models (LLMs) but remains bottlenecked by limited
labeled samples for continued data scaling. Reinforcement learning with
intrinsic rewards (RLIR), where the policy model assigns rewards to its own
rollouts, enables sustainable scaling in unlabeled settings, yet its
performance and stability lag behind RLVR. We trace this gap to a system bias:
the model tends to overestimate its high-confidence rollouts, leading to biased
and unstable reward estimation. This bias accumulates as training progresses,
with deviations from the oracle drifting toward over-reward, causing unstable
training. We characterize this bias using three metrics: $\rho_{\text{noise}}$,
$\rho_{\text{selfbias}}$, and $\rho_{\text{symbias}}$. We find that
$\rho_{\text{noise}}$ and $\rho_{\text{symbias}}$ impact convergence, while
$\rho_{\text{selfbias}}$ amplifies both correct and incorrect updates, leading
to instability. To mitigate this, we propose reinforcement learning with
ensembled rewards (RLER), which aggregates diverse models and adapts reward
interpolation and rollout selection. Extensive experiments show that RLER
improves by +13.6% over RLIR and is only 3.6% below RLVR, achieving stable
scaling on unlabeled samples, making it highly applicable.

Motivation: 癫痫预测需要大量EEG数据，但标注成本高且涉及隐私问题。联邦学习虽然能保护隐私，但在现实场景中由于患者间差异大，现有方法在异质客户端设置下性能不佳。

Method: 提出FedL2T框架，采用双教师知识蒸馏策略：每个客户端同时从全局聚合模型和动态分配的同伴模型学习；使用自适应多级蒸馏策略对齐预测输出和中间特征表示；引入近端正则化项约束个性化模型更新。

Conclusion: FedL2T为隐私敏感的医疗场景中的癫痫预测提供了一个可靠且个性化的解决方案，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: The training of deep learning models in seizure prediction requires large
amounts of Electroencephalogram (EEG) data. However, acquiring sufficient
labeled EEG data is difficult due to annotation costs and privacy constraints.
Federated Learning (FL) enables privacy-preserving collaborative training by
sharing model updates instead of raw data. However, due to the inherent
inter-patient variability in real-world scenarios, existing FL-based seizure
prediction methods struggle to achieve robust performance under heterogeneous
client settings. To address this challenge, we propose FedL2T, a personalized
federated learning framework that leverages a novel two-teacher knowledge
distillation strategy to generate superior personalized models for each client.
Specifically, each client simultaneously learns from a globally aggregated
model and a dynamically assigned peer model, promoting more direct and enriched
knowledge exchange. To ensure reliable knowledge transfer, FedL2T employs an
adaptive multi-level distillation strategy that aligns both prediction outputs
and intermediate feature representations based on task confidence. In addition,
a proximal regularization term is introduced to constrain personalized model
updates, thereby enhancing training stability. Extensive experiments on two EEG
datasets demonstrate that FedL2T consistently outperforms state-of-the-art FL
methods, particularly under low-label conditions. Moreover, FedL2T exhibits
rapid and stable convergence toward optimal performance, thereby reducing the
number of communication rounds and associated overhead. These results
underscore the potential of FedL2T as a reliable and personalized solution for
seizure prediction in privacy-sensitive healthcare scenarios.

Motivation: 现有推理方法如CoT、ToT等虽然扩展了搜索空间，但经常产生不可行动作或幻觉步骤，无法确保计划与用户意图对齐并满足符号约束。

Conclusion: Const-o-T为约束引导推理提供了可泛化的基础，使LLMs能够进行更高效、约束对齐和领域自适应的规划。

Abstract: While researchers have made significant progress in enabling large language
models (LLMs) to perform multi-step planning, LLMs struggle to ensure that
those plans align with high-level user intent and satisfy symbolic constraints,
especially in complex, multi-step domains. Existing reasoning approaches such
as Chain-of-Thought (CoT), Tree-of-Thought (ToT), and verifier-augmented
methods, expand the search space but often yield infeasible actions or
hallucinated steps. To overcome these limitations, we propose
Constraints-of-Thought (Const-o-T), a framework that provides a structured
prior that enables Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) focus search on semantically
meaningful paths. Each reasoning step is represented as an (intent, constraint)
pair, which serves both to compress the search space and enforce validity.
Unlike prior methods that merely generate reasoning traces or validate outputs
post hoc, Const-o-T uses (intent, constraint)pairs to actively focus the search
toward feasible and meaningful plans. We integrate Const-o-T into MCTS using a
structured representation of intent-constraint pairs constraints prune
infeasible branches and guide exploration toward semantically valid actions,
improving planning efficiency and verifiable decision-making. We demonstrate
across three domains Risk game, CAD code generation, and arithmetic reasoning
that our approach outperforms baselines, yielding higher accuracy and stronger
structural alignment. Our contribution is to demonstrate that Const-of-T offers
a generalizable foundation for constraint-guided reasoning, enabling more
efficient, constraint-aligned, and domain-adaptable planning with LLMs.

Abstract: Hardware-Aware Neural Architecture Search (HW-NAS) has emerged as a powerful
tool for designing efficient deep neural networks (DNNs) tailored to edge
devices. However, existing methods remain largely impractical for real-world
deployment due to their high time cost, extensive manual profiling, and poor
scalability across diverse hardware platforms with complex, device-specific
energy behavior. In this paper, we present PlatformX, a fully automated and
transferable HW-NAS framework designed to overcome these limitations. PlatformX
integrates four key components: (i) an energy-driven search space that expands
conventional NAS design by incorporating energy-critical configurations,
enabling exploration of high-efficiency architectures; (ii) a transferable
kernel-level energy predictor across devices and incrementally refined with
minimal on-device samples; (iii) a Pareto-based multi-objective search
algorithm that balances energy and accuracy to identify optimal trade-offs; and
(iv) a high-resolution runtime energy profiling system that automates on-device
power measurement using external monitors without human intervention. We
evaluate PlatformX across multiple mobile platforms, showing that it
significantly reduces search overhead while preserving accuracy and energy
fidelity. It identifies models with up to 0.94 accuracy or as little as 0.16 mJ
per inference, both outperforming MobileNet-V2 in accuracy and efficiency. Code
and tutorials are available at github.com/amai-gsu/PlatformX.

*Ziyi Wang,Nan Jiang,Guang Lin,Qifan Song*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出SQS框架，通过贝叶斯变分学习同时进行剪枝和低比特量化，实现比现有方法更高的压缩率且保持性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法单独使用权重剪枝或低比特量化，压缩率不理想，需要统一框架同时优化剪枝和量化

Method: 使用spike-and-slab先验诱导稀疏性，用高斯混合模型建模量化权重，实现低比特精度

Result: 在ResNet、BERT-base、Llama3、Qwen2.5等模型上实验，压缩率高于现有方法，性能下降相当

Conclusion: SQS框架能有效同时进行剪枝和量化，实现更高的压缩率

Abstract: Compressing large-scale neural networks is essential for deploying models on
resource-constrained devices. Most existing methods adopt weight pruning or
low-bit quantization individually, often resulting in suboptimal compression
rates to preserve acceptable performance drops. We introduce a unified
framework for simultaneous pruning and low-bit quantization via Bayesian
variational learning (SQS), which achieves higher compression rates than prior
baselines while maintaining comparable performance. The key idea is to employ a
spike-and-slab prior to inducing sparsity and model quantized weights using
Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) to enable low-bit precision. In theory, we
provide the consistent result of our proposed variational approach to a sparse
and quantized deep neural network. Extensive experiments on compressing ResNet,
BERT-base, Llama3, and Qwen2.5 models show that our method achieves higher
compression rates than a line of existing methods with comparable performance
drops.

*Changsheng Wang,Yihua Zhang,Dennis Wei,Jinghan Jia,Pin-Yu Chen,Sijia Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该研究首次探讨了在噪声遗忘数据集下的大语言模型遗忘问题，发现即使遗忘数据被扰动或质量较低，只要核心语义信号得以保留，遗忘过程仍能保持稳健。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM遗忘方法假设可以访问干净、定义明确的遗忘数据，但现实中的遗忘数据往往是低质量、合成重写或带有水印的，这引发了遗忘可靠性的担忧。

Method: 系统性地在噪声遗忘集上对最先进的LLM遗忘方法RMU和NPO进行基准测试，并提出基于显著性的解释框架来分析遗忘的稳健性。

Result: 研究发现遗忘对数据扰动具有惊人的稳健性，只要核心语义信号得以保留。遗忘算法主要受深层语义线索而非浅层词汇模式引导。

Conclusion: LLM遗忘在噪声遗忘集下仍能保持有效，这为现实世界中不完美遗忘数据的应用提供了理论支持，表明遗忘过程主要依赖于语义内容而非表面形式。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit remarkable generative capabilities but
raise ethical and security concerns by memorizing sensitive data, reinforcing
biases, and producing harmful content. These risks have spurred interest in LLM
unlearning, the task of removing knowledge associated with undesirable data
from pre-trained models. However, most existing methods assume access to clean,
well-defined forget data samples, whereas real-world forget data could often be
low-quality, synthetically rewritten, or watermarked, casting doubt on the
reliability of unlearning. This work presents the first study of unlearning
under perturbed or low-fidelity forget data, referred to as noisy forget sets.
By systematically benchmarking state-of-the-art LLM unlearning methods, RMU and
NPO, on such noisy forget sets, we find that unlearning remains surprisingly
robust to perturbations, provided that core semantic signals are preserved. To
explain this robustness, we propose a saliency-based interpretation: key
semantic components that drive forgetting remain consistently influential
despite substantial variation in surface form. This suggests that unlearning
algorithms are primarily guided by deep semantic cues rather than shallow
lexical patterns.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了Value-State Gated Attention (VGA)机制，通过基于值向量的可学习门控来打破注意力与值状态之间的恶性循环，有效缓解极端令牌现象。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer架构的大模型容易受到极端令牌现象（如注意力汇聚点和值状态流失）的影响，这些问题会降低模型性能、量化保真度和可解释性，源于模型学习到的一种低效的'无操作'行为。

Method: 引入VGA机制，使用从值向量直接计算的可学习、数据依赖的门控来调节输出，通过理论梯度分析证明这种基于值状态的门控比先前基于输入嵌入的方法更有效。

Result: 实验表明VGA显著减轻了注意力汇聚点的形成，稳定了值状态范数，带来了性能提升、鲁棒的量化保真度和增强的模型可解释性。

Conclusion: VGA提供了一种简单、专用且稳定的架构机制，通过直接打破注意力与值状态之间的相互强化循环，有效解决了极端令牌问题。

Abstract: Large models based on the Transformer architecture are susceptible to
extreme-token phenomena, such as attention sinks and value-state drains. These
issues, which degrade model performance, quantization fidelity, and
interpretability, arise from a problematic mutual reinforcement mechanism where
the model learns an inefficient 'no-op' behavior by focusing attention on
tokens with near-zero value states. In this paper, we propose Value-State Gated
Attention (VGA), a simple, dedicated, and stable architectural mechanism for
performing 'no-op' attention efficiently by directly breaking this cycle. VGA
introduces a learnable, data-dependent gate, computed directly from the value
vectors (V), to modulate the output. Through a theoretical analysis of the
underlying gradients, we show that gating the value-state with a function of
itself is more effective at decoupling value and attention score updates than
prior methods that gate on input embeddings. This creates a direct regulatory
pathway that allows the model to suppress a token's contribution based on its
emergent value representation. Our experiments demonstrate that VGA
significantly mitigates the formation of attention sinks and stabilizes
value-state norms, leading to improved performance, robust quantization
fidelity, and enhanced model interpretability.

*Ian Harshbarger,Calvin Chidambaram*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Slim Scheduler是一个混合调度框架，结合PPO强化学习和贪心调度器，用于可瘦身模型的分布式推理调度，能在不同精度和延迟之间实现权衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有神经网络调度研究主要关注固定宽度的静态端到端模型，忽视了适应异构硬件和运行时条件变化的动态方法。

Method: 采用分层设计：本地贪心调度器处理请求批处理和实例扩展，PPO路由器学习全局路由策略（设备选择、宽度比、批配置）。

Result: 相比随机任务分配基线，在精度降至最瘦模型（70.3%）时，平均延迟减少96.45%，能耗减少97.31%；也可在提高精度的同时降低平均延迟和能耗，但会增加延迟和能耗的标准差。

Conclusion: 该分层设计降低了搜索空间复杂度，缓解了对特定硬件的过拟合，平衡了效率和吞吐量。

Abstract: Most neural network scheduling research focuses on optimizing static,
end-to-end models of fixed width, overlooking dynamic approaches that adapt to
heterogeneous hardware and fluctuating runtime conditions. We present Slim
Scheduler, a hybrid scheduling framework that integrates a Proximal Policy
Optimization (PPO) reinforcement learning policy with algorithmic, greedy
schedulers to coordinate distributed inference for slimmable models. Each
server runs a local greedy scheduler that batches compatible requests and
manages instance scaling based on VRAM and utilization constraints, while the
PPO router learns global routing policies for device selection, width ratio,
and batch configuration. This hierarchical design reduces search space
complexity, mitigates overfitting to specific hardware, and balances efficiency
and throughput. Compared to a purely randomized task distribution baseline,
Slim Scheduler can achieve various accuracy and latency trade-offs such as: A
96.45% reduction in mean latency and a 97.31% reduction in energy usage
dropping accuracy to the slimmest model available (70.3%). It can then
accomplish an overall reduction in average latency plus energy consumption with
an increase in accuracy at the cost of higher standard deviations of said
latency and energy, effecting overall task throughput.

TL;DR: MagicDock是一个用于从头配体设计的框架，通过梯度反演和可微分表面建模解决现有方法的局限性，在9个场景中相比最先进方法平均提升27.1%和11.7%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有从头配体设计方法的三个主要限制：伪从头设计、有限的对接建模和僵化的配体类型，旨在实现真正的从头配体生成。

Method: 采用梯度反演框架和可微分表面建模，将对接知识融入主干模型并通过反向梯度流指导配体生成，使用可学习的3D点云表示精确捕捉结合细节，支持不同配体类型的定制化设计。

Result: 在9个不同场景的广泛实验中，MagicDock相比专门用于蛋白质或分子配体设计的最先进基线方法分别实现了27.1%和11.7%的平均改进。

Conclusion: MagicDock通过其创新框架成功解决了从头配体设计的关键挑战，提供了理论保证并在多个场景中显著优于现有方法，具有广泛的适用性。

Abstract: De novo ligand design is a fundamental task that seeks to generate protein or
molecule candidates that can effectively dock with protein receptors and
achieve strong binding affinity entirely from scratch. It holds paramount
significance for a wide spectrum of biomedical applications. However, most
existing studies are constrained by the \textbf{Pseudo De Novo},
\textbf{Limited Docking Modeling}, and \textbf{Inflexible Ligand Type}. To
address these issues, we propose MagicDock, a forward-looking framework
grounded in the progressive pipeline and differentiable surface modeling. (1)
We adopt a well-designed gradient inversion framework. To begin with, general
docking knowledge of receptors and ligands is incorporated into the backbone
model. Subsequently, the docking knowledge is instantiated as reverse gradient
flows by binding prediction, which iteratively guide the de novo generation of
ligands. (2) We emphasize differentiable surface modeling in the docking
process, leveraging learnable 3D point-cloud representations to precisely
capture binding details, thereby ensuring that the generated ligands preserve
docking validity through direct and interpretable spatial fingerprints. (3) We
introduce customized designs for different ligand types and integrate them into
a unified gradient inversion framework with flexible triggers, thereby ensuring
broad applicability. Moreover, we provide rigorous theoretical guarantees for
each component of MagicDock. Extensive experiments across 9 scenarios
demonstrate that MagicDock achieves average improvements of 27.1\% and 11.7\%
over SOTA baselines specialized for protein or molecule ligand design,
respectively.

TL;DR: 该研究分析了近十年AI系统训练的环境影响，发现即使采用优化策略，机器学习模型训练的环境影响仍在指数级增长，存在回弹效应。仅提高效率无法确保可持续性，需要减少AI活动和质疑大规模训练的频率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着机器学习性能提升，计算需求激增导致能耗和环境问题日益严重。虽然已有硬件、算法和碳优化策略，但这些策略是否能实现可持续的ML训练尚不明确。

Method: 通过估算近十年包括大语言模型在内的著名AI系统训练的环境影响，重点关注显卡的生命周期分析，考察生产和使用阶段的影响。

Result: 发现两个关键趋势：显卡生产影响持续增加；ML模型训练能耗和环境影响呈指数增长，即使采用位置转移等减排策略，优化策略无法缓解训练带来的影响，存在回弹效应。

Conclusion: 必须考虑硬件的整个生命周期而非仅使用阶段，仅提高效率无法确保ML可持续性，需要减少AI活动并质疑资源密集型训练的规模和频率。

Abstract: Recent Machine Learning (ML) approaches have shown increased performance on
benchmarks but at the cost of escalating computational demands. Hardware,
algorithmic and carbon optimizations have been proposed to curb energy
consumption and environmental impacts. Can these strategies lead to sustainable
ML model training? Here, we estimate the environmental impacts associated with
training notable AI systems over the last decade, including Large Language
Models, with a focus on the life cycle of graphics cards. Our analysis reveals
two critical trends: First, the impacts of graphics cards production have
increased steadily over this period; Second, energy consumption and
environmental impacts associated with training ML models have increased
exponentially, even when considering reduction strategies such as location
shifting to places with less carbon intensive electricity mixes. Optimization
strategies do not mitigate the impacts induced by model training, evidencing
rebound effect. We show that the impacts of hardware must be considered over
the entire life cycle rather than the sole use phase in order to avoid impact
shifting. Our study demonstrates that increasing efficiency alone cannot ensure
sustainability in ML. Mitigating the environmental impact of AI also requires
reducing AI activities and questioning the scale and frequency of
resource-intensive training.

TL;DR: 论文指出当前语言模型防御评估方法存在缺陷，应使用自适应攻击者来评估防御效果。通过系统优化技术成功绕过了12种近期防御方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前语言模型防御评估方法存在缺陷，通常使用静态攻击集或弱优化方法，无法真实反映防御能力。

Method: 使用自适应攻击策略，系统调优和扩展通用优化技术（梯度下降、强化学习、随机搜索、人工引导探索）来对抗防御。

Result: 成功绕过了12种近期防御方法，大多数防御的攻击成功率超过90%，而原报告中的攻击成功率接近零。

Conclusion: 未来的防御工作必须考虑更强的攻击方法，才能做出可靠和令人信服的鲁棒性声明。

Abstract: How should we evaluate the robustness of language model defenses? Current
defenses against jailbreaks and prompt injections (which aim to prevent an
attacker from eliciting harmful knowledge or remotely triggering malicious
actions, respectively) are typically evaluated either against a static set of
harmful attack strings, or against computationally weak optimization methods
that were not designed with the defense in mind. We argue that this evaluation
process is flawed.
  Instead, we should evaluate defenses against adaptive attackers who
explicitly modify their attack strategy to counter a defense's design while
spending considerable resources to optimize their objective. By systematically
tuning and scaling general optimization techniques-gradient descent,
reinforcement learning, random search, and human-guided exploration-we bypass
12 recent defenses (based on a diverse set of techniques) with attack success
rate above 90% for most; importantly, the majority of defenses originally
reported near-zero attack success rates. We believe that future defense work
must consider stronger attacks, such as the ones we describe, in order to make
reliable and convincing claims of robustness.

TL;DR: 本文从反向视角出发，假设优化器收敛到任意点，研究不同优化器作为特征值滤波器的行为。梯度下降自然避免最尖锐的极小值，而SAM算法更倾向于宽盆地。作者提出了两种增强特征值滤波的新算法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习训练中各种优化器往往能找到接近全局最优解，本文从收敛到任意点的假设出发，研究优化器的特征值滤波特性及其对极小值选择的影响。

Method: 采用广义Hadamard-Perron稳定流形定理，分析一般半代数C^2函数，无需额外非退化条件或全局Lipschitz界假设。提出了两种增强特征值滤波的新算法。

Result: 理论分析表明不同优化器具有不同的特征值滤波特性：标准梯度下降避免最尖锐极小值，SAM算法更倾向于宽盆地。数值实验在前馈神经网络上验证了结论。

Conclusion: 优化器可视为特征值滤波器，其超参数决定了滤波特性。提出的新算法能更有效地促进宽极小值，为理解优化器行为提供了新视角。

Abstract: Ample empirical evidence in deep neural network training suggests that a
variety of optimizers tend to find nearly global optima. In this article, we
adopt the reversed perspective that convergence to an arbitrary point is
assumed rather than proven, focusing on the consequences of this assumption.
From this viewpoint, in line with recent advances on the edge-of-stability
phenomenon, we argue that different optimizers effectively act as eigenvalue
filters determined by their hyperparameters. Specifically, the standard
gradient descent method inherently avoids the sharpest minima, whereas
Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM) algorithms go even further by actively
favoring wider basins. Inspired by these insights, we propose two novel
algorithms that exhibit enhanced eigenvalue filtering, effectively promoting
wider minima. Our theoretical analysis leverages a generalized Hadamard--Perron
stable manifold theorem and applies to general semialgebraic $C^2$ functions,
without requiring additional non-degeneracy conditions or global Lipschitz
bound assumptions. We support our conclusions with numerical experiments on
feed-forward neural networks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度强化学习在自动驾驶中表现出色，但对对抗攻击的脆弱性阻碍了实际部署。现有方法存在三个关键问题：对抗短视攻击、难以引发安全关键事件、训练不稳定和政策漂移。

Method: IGCARL包含战略性目标对抗者和鲁棒驾驶代理。对抗者利用DRL的时序决策能力执行战略性多步攻击，专注于引发安全关键事件；驾驶代理通过与对抗者交互学习鲁棒策略，并在约束条件下优化以确保训练稳定性。

Result: 实验表明，IGCARL相比最先进方法至少提高27.9%的成功率，显著增强了对对抗攻击的鲁棒性，提升了DRL自动驾驶的安全性和可靠性。

Conclusion: IGCARL通过战略性对抗训练和约束优化，有效解决了自动驾驶DRL策略的对抗脆弱性问题，为安全可靠的自动驾驶系统提供了有力保障。

Abstract: Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has demonstrated remarkable success in
developing autonomous driving policies. However, its vulnerability to
adversarial attacks remains a critical barrier to real-world deployment.
Although existing robust methods have achieved success, they still suffer from
three key issues: (i) these methods are trained against myopic adversarial
attacks, limiting their abilities to respond to more strategic threats, (ii)
they have trouble causing truly safety-critical events (e.g., collisions), but
instead often result in minor consequences, and (iii) these methods can
introduce learning instability and policy drift during training due to the lack
of robust constraints. To address these issues, we propose Intelligent
General-sum Constrained Adversarial Reinforcement Learning (IGCARL), a novel
robust autonomous driving approach that consists of a strategic targeted
adversary and a robust driving agent. The strategic targeted adversary is
designed to leverage the temporal decision-making capabilities of DRL to
execute strategically coordinated multi-step attacks. In addition, it
explicitly focuses on inducing safety-critical events by adopting a general-sum
objective. The robust driving agent learns by interacting with the adversary to
develop a robust autonomous driving policy against adversarial attacks. To
ensure stable learning in adversarial environments and to mitigate policy drift
caused by attacks, the agent is optimized under a constrained formulation.
Extensive experiments show that IGCARL improves the success rate by at least
27.9\% over state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating superior robustness to
adversarial attacks and enhancing the safety and reliability of DRL-based
autonomous driving.

Abstract: Transportation remains a major contributor to greenhouse gas emissions,
highlighting the urgency of transitioning toward sustainable alternatives such
as electric vehicles (EVs). Yet, uneven spatial distribution and irregular
utilization of charging infrastructure create challenges for both power grid
stability and investment planning. This study introduces TW-GCN, a
spatio-temporal forecasting framework that combines Graph Convolutional
Networks with temporal architectures to predict EV charging demand in
Tennessee, United States (U.S.). We utilize real-world traffic flows, weather
conditions, and proprietary data provided by one of the largest EV
infrastructure company in the U.S. to capture both spatial dependencies and
temporal dynamics. Extensive experiments across varying lag horizons,
clustering strategies, and sequence lengths reveal that mid-horizon (3-hour)
forecasts achieve the best balance between responsiveness and stability, with
1DCNN consistently outperforming other temporal models. Regional analysis shows
disparities in predictive accuracy across East, Middle, and West Tennessee,
reflecting how station density, population, and local demand variability shape
model performance. The proposed TW-GCN framework advances the integration of
data-driven intelligence into EV infrastructure planning, supporting both
sustainable mobility transitions and resilient grid management.

Motivation: 在工业生产环境中，时间序列的状态变化识别对于异常检测至关重要。分割技术可以减少时间不确定性，特别是在多变量环境中，有助于改善异常检测性能。

Method: 采用变点检测（如ChangeFinder算法）进行时间序列分割作为预处理步骤，然后结合异构集成算法（包括PCA+LSTM集成、随机森林和XGBoost）进行异常检测。

Conclusion: 时间序列分割作为预处理步骤能有效提升异构集成方法在异常检测中的性能。未来工作将探索结合变点研究的加权特征，进一步优化早期异常检测模型。

Abstract: Concerning machine learning, segmentation models can identify state changes
within time series, facilitating the detection of transitions between normal
and anomalous conditions. Specific techniques such as Change Point Detection
(CPD), particularly algorithms like ChangeFinder, have been successfully
applied to segment time series and improve anomaly detection by reducing
temporal uncertainty, especially in multivariate environments. In this work, we
explored how the integration of segmentation techniques, combined with a
heterogeneous ensemble, can enhance anomaly detection in an industrial
production context. The results show that applying segmentation as a
pre-processing step before selecting heterogeneous ensemble algorithms provided
a significant advantage in our case study, improving the AUC-ROC metric from
0.8599 (achieved with a PCA and LSTM ensemble) to 0.9760 (achieved with Random
Forest and XGBoost). This improvement is imputable to the ability of
segmentation to reduce temporal ambiguity and facilitate the learning process
of supervised algorithms. In our future work, we intend to assess the benefit
of introducing weighted features derived from the study of change points,
combined with segmentation and the use of heterogeneous ensembles, to further
optimize model performance in early anomaly detection.

Conclusion: FLToP CTC有效解决了CTC瓶颈问题，为资源受限环境和实时应用提供了可扩展性，提升了语音识别的可访问性和效率。

Abstract: CTC-based ASR systems face computational and memory bottlenecks in
resource-limited environments. Traditional CTC decoders, requiring up to 90% of
processing time in systems (e.g., wav2vec2-large on L4 GPUs), face
inefficiencies due to exhaustive token-level operations. This paper introduces
Frame Level Token Pruning for Connectionist Temporal Classification (FLToP
CTC), a novel decoding algorithm that employs frame-level token pruning guided
by a relative threshold probability. By dynamically eliminating low-probability
tokens per frame, FLToP CTC reduces compute and memory demands while
maintaining negligible WER degradation. On LibriSpeech, FLToP CTC achieves a
10.5x runtime speedup and 2.78x memory reduction versus standard CTC decoders.
Its simplicity enables seamless integration into CTC decoders across platforms
(CPUs, GPUs, etc.). FLToP CTC addresses CTC bottlenecks, offering scalability
for resource-limited environments and realtime applications, enhancing speech
recognition accessibility and efficiency.

Conclusion: BioCodec为生物信号标记化提供了多功能解决方案，性能与最先进模型相当，适用于多种生物信号数据类型。

Abstract: Neurophysiological recordings such as electroencephalography (EEG) offer
accessible and minimally invasive means of estimating physiological activity
for applications in healthcare, diagnostic screening, and even immersive
entertainment. However, these recordings yield high-dimensional, noisy
time-series data that typically require extensive pre-processing and
handcrafted feature extraction to reveal meaningful information. Recently,
there has been a surge of interest in applying representation learning
techniques from large pre-trained (foundation) models to effectively decode and
interpret biosignals. We discuss the challenges posed for incorporating such
methods and introduce BioCodec, an alternative representation learning
framework inspired by neural codecs to capture low-level signal characteristics
in the form of discrete tokens. Pre-trained on thousands of EEG hours, BioCodec
shows efficacy across multiple downstream tasks, ranging from clinical
diagnostic tasks and sleep physiology to decoding speech and motor imagery,
particularly in low-resource settings. Additionally, we provide a qualitative
analysis of codebook usage and estimate the spatial coherence of codebook
embeddings from EEG connectivity. Notably, we also document the suitability of
our method to other biosignal data, i.e., electromyographic (EMG) signals.
Overall, the proposed approach provides a versatile solution for biosignal
tokenization that performs competitively with state-of-the-art models. The
source code and model checkpoints are shared.

### [70] [AdaPM: a Partial Momentum Algorithm for LLM Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09103)
*Yimu Zhang,Yuanshi Liu,Cong Fang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: AdaPM是一种自适应训练策略，通过部分动量实现内存高效优化器，减少90%以上动量内存占用，同时保持模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型训练中动量广泛使用但内存占用大，需要解决动量存储的内存挑战。

Method: 采用非均匀动量设计，对大多数块不使用完整动量，并通过偏置校正技术增强部分动量以减少性能损失。

Result: 在60M到1.5B语言模型预训练、监督微调和RLHF中，减少90%以上动量内存，结合二阶统计量技术可进一步减少95%优化器状态内存，节省30%以上GPU小时。

Conclusion: AdaPM能显著减少内存占用同时保持优化性能，是高效训练大型语言模型的有效方法。

Abstract: In the training of large language models, momentum is widely used and often
demonstrated to achieve significant acceleration. However, storing momentum
typically presents memory challenges. In this paper, we propose AdaPM, an
adaptive training strategy that leverages partial momentum to implement a
memory-efficient optimizer. To this end, AdaPM utilizes a non-uniform momentum
design: for most blocks, full momentum is not necessary to preserve the
performance of the optimization. In the momentum design of AdaPM, to mitigate
the bias and performance loss caused by partial momentum, we enhance the
partial momentum by a bias correction technique. Empirically, we verify that
our approach reduces memory by over $90\%$ in momentum while maintaining both
efficiency and performance for pretraining various language models ranging from
60M to 1.5B, as well as for supervised fine-tuning and RLHF. AdaPM can further
reduce memory by up to $95\%$ in optimizer states by combining the
memory-efficient technique on the second-order statistic, saving over $30\%$
GPU hours for pretraining GPT-2 1.5B.

TL;DR: 提出MemLoss方法，利用历史生成的对抗样本来增强模型对抗训练效果，在保持自然准确率的同时提升对抗鲁棒性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对抗训练方法在提升模型鲁棒性时往往牺牲自然准确率，需要一种平衡两者性能的方法

Method: 利用历史生成的对抗样本（记忆对抗样本）在多个训练周期中重复使用，增强模型训练效果

Result: 在CIFAR-10等多个数据集上实验表明，MemLoss相比现有方法获得更好的准确率，同时保持强对抗鲁棒性

Conclusion: MemLoss通过有效利用历史对抗样本，实现了自然准确率和对抗鲁棒性的平衡提升

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a new approach called MemLoss to improve the
adversarial training of machine learning models. MemLoss leverages previously
generated adversarial examples, referred to as 'Memory Adversarial Examples,'
to enhance model robustness and accuracy without compromising performance on
clean data. By using these examples across training epochs, MemLoss provides a
balanced improvement in both natural accuracy and adversarial robustness.
Experimental results on multiple datasets, including CIFAR-10, demonstrate that
our method achieves better accuracy compared to existing adversarial training
methods while maintaining strong robustness against attacks.

Main category: cs.LG

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法基于数据记录的平均隐私风险评估组隐私风险，可能低估组间隐私风险差异，且最坏情况风险评估方法耗时较长，限制了实际应用。

Method: 引入成员推断游戏高效审计近似最坏情况隐私风险；改进DP-SGD算法，采用自适应组特定梯度裁剪策略。

Result: 实验表明，该方法能更严格地测量组隐私风险，可靠评估组间隐私风险差异；改进的算法有效减少了组间隐私风险差异。

Conclusion: 提出的方法增强了差分隐私机器学习中隐私保护的公平性，通过更准确的隐私风险评估和算法改进实现了更公平的隐私保护。

Abstract: While significant progress has been made in conventional fairness-aware
machine learning (ML) and differentially private ML (DPML), the fairness of
privacy protection across groups remains underexplored. Existing studies have
proposed methods to assess group privacy risks, but these are based on the
average-case privacy risks of data records. Such approaches may underestimate
the group privacy risks, thereby potentially underestimating the disparity
across group privacy risks. Moreover, the current method for assessing the
worst-case privacy risks of data records is time-consuming, limiting their
practical applicability. To address these limitations, we introduce a novel
membership inference game that can efficiently audit the approximate worst-case
privacy risks of data records. Experimental results demonstrate that our method
provides a more stringent measurement of group privacy risks, yielding a
reliable assessment of the disparity in group privacy risks. Furthermore, to
promote privacy protection fairness in DPML, we enhance the standard DP-SGD
algorithm with an adaptive group-specific gradient clipping strategy, inspired
by the design of canaries in differential privacy auditing studies. Extensive
experiments confirm that our algorithm effectively reduces the disparity in
group privacy risks, thereby enhancing the fairness of privacy protection in
DPML.

*Orin Levy,Liad Erez,Alon Cohen,Yishay Mansour*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文研究了具有延迟反馈的上下文多臂老虎机问题，提出了在有限策略类和一般函数逼近设置下的遗憾最小化算法，并建立了相应的遗憾上界。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在现实世界的在线学习场景中，反馈往往存在延迟，这种延迟可能由对手选择。现有的上下文多臂老虎机算法大多假设即时反馈，因此需要开发能够处理延迟反馈的算法。

Method: 对于有限策略类，直接使用策略类；对于一般函数逼近设置，使用在线最小二乘回归预言机。提出了一种基于Hedge的Vovk聚合预测器的稳定性分析作为预言机实现。

Result: 在有限策略类下获得最优期望遗憾界O(√(KT log|Π|) + √(D log|Π|))；在一般函数逼近设置下获得O(√(KTℛ_T(O)) + √(d_max D β))，其中β≤log|F|时进一步简化为O(√(KT log|F|) + √(d_max D log|F|))。

Conclusion: 本文为延迟反馈的上下文多臂老虎机问题提供了有效的算法和理论保证，在有限策略类下达到最优，在一般函数逼近设置下与下界相差√d_max因子。

Abstract: We present regret minimization algorithms for the contextual multi-armed
bandit (CMAB) problem over $K$ actions in the presence of delayed feedback, a
scenario where loss observations arrive with delays chosen by an adversary. As
a preliminary result, assuming direct access to a finite policy class $\Pi$ we
establish an optimal expected regret bound of $ O (\sqrt{KT \log |\Pi|} +
\sqrt{D \log |\Pi|)} $ where $D$ is the sum of delays. For our main
contribution, we study the general function approximation setting over a
(possibly infinite) contextual loss function class $ \mathcal{F} $ with access
to an online least-square regression oracle $\mathcal{O}$ over $\mathcal{F}$.
In this setting, we achieve an expected regret bound of
$O(\sqrt{KT\mathcal{R}_T(\mathcal{O})} + \sqrt{ d_{\max} D \beta})$ assuming
FIFO order, where $d_{\max}$ is the maximal delay, $\mathcal{R}_T(\mathcal{O})$
is an upper bound on the oracle's regret and $\beta$ is a stability parameter
associated with the oracle. We complement this general result by presenting a
novel stability analysis of a Hedge-based version of Vovk's aggregating
forecaster as an oracle implementation for least-square regression over a
finite function class $\mathcal{F}$ and show that its stability parameter
$\beta$ is bounded by $\log |\mathcal{F}|$, resulting in an expected regret
bound of $O(\sqrt{KT \log |\mathcal{F}|} + \sqrt{d_{\max} D \log
|\mathcal{F}|})$ which is a $\sqrt{d_{\max}}$ factor away from the lower bound
of $\Omega(\sqrt{KT \log |\mathcal{F}|} + \sqrt{D \log |\mathcal{F}|})$ that we
also present.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种从成对比较中估计密度的方法，通过将未观测的目标密度与经过温度调节的胜者密度相关联，使用分数匹配学习胜者分数，然后通过"去温度化"来估计目标密度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究从成对比较中进行密度估计，主要动机是专家知识获取和从人类反馈中学习。该方法能够从数百到数千个成对比较中学习模拟专家的复杂多元信念密度。

Method: 将目标密度与温度调节的胜者密度相关联，通过分数匹配学习胜者分数，然后对估计的胜者密度分数进行"去温度化"来估计目标密度。使用基于Bradley-Terry模型的估计器，并通过分数缩放的退火Langevin动力学生成温度样本训练扩散模型。

Result: 证明了信念密度和胜者密度的分数向量是共线的，通过位置相关的温度场连接。给出了该场的解析公式，并提出了在Bradley-Terry模型下的估计器。

Conclusion: 该方法能够从仅数百到数千个成对比较中有效学习复杂多元信念密度，为专家知识获取和人类反馈学习提供了有效工具。

Abstract: We study density estimation from pairwise comparisons, motivated by expert
knowledge elicitation and learning from human feedback. We relate the
unobserved target density to a tempered winner density (marginal density of
preferred choices), learning the winner's score via score-matching. This allows
estimating the target by `de-tempering' the estimated winner density's score.
We prove that the score vectors of the belief and the winner density are
collinear, linked by a position-dependent tempering field. We give analytical
formulas for this field and propose an estimator for it under the Bradley-Terry
model. Using a diffusion model trained on tempered samples generated via
score-scaled annealed Langevin dynamics, we can learn complex multivariate
belief densities of simulated experts, from only hundreds to thousands of
pairwise comparisons.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出Logits Replay + MoClip两阶段框架，通过压缩logit空间的监督信号和稳定优化更新，在提升领域性能的同时减轻通用能力遗忘，降低40%以上训练成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLMs在领域适应训练中面临的专长化与通用能力之间的权衡问题，现有方法在计算、数据访问或适应性方面成本较高。

Method: 两阶段框架：Stage 0记录覆盖概率阈值的动态Top-K token子集（包含正确标签）；Stage 1重放这些紧凑子集计算精确重归一化损失。MoClip优化器限制梯度动量旋转并应用arctan2重缩放更新。

Result: 在通信技术和NL2SQL任务上提升领域性能，在通用基准（MMLU、BBH、GPQA、MATH）上减轻遗忘，训练成本降低超过40%。

Conclusion: 该方法为LLMs领域适应提供了可扩展、架构无关的路径，无需牺牲泛化能力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often face a trade-off in post-training:
improvements on specialized domains frequently come at the expense of general
capabilities. Existing solutions attempt to mitigate this tension via
regularization, selective parameter updates, or data-centric replay, but each
imposes significant costs in computation, data access, or adaptability. Recent
work has shown that training signals can be compressed to subsets of logits
without severe accuracy loss, suggesting a path toward efficient adaptation.
However, naive truncation destabilizes optimization and exacerbates forgetting.
  We introduce Logits Replay + MoClip, a two-stage framework that compresses
supervision in the logit space and stabilizes optimization at the update level.
In Stage 0, we record dynamic Top-K token subsets that cover a probability
threshold, always including the gold label. In Stage 1, we replay these compact
subsets to compute exact renormalized losses, avoiding full softmax computation
and implicitly regularizing. To ensure stability, we design MoClip, an
optimizer that caps gradient-momentum rotation and applies an arctan2-based
rescaling of updates. Empirically, our method improves domain performance on
Communication Technology (CT) and NL2SQL tasks while mitigating forgetting on
general benchmarks (MMLU, BBH, GPQA, MATH), and reduces training cost by over
40%. Together, these contributions offer a scalable, architecture-agnostic path
for domain adaptation of LLMs without sacrificing generalization.

TL;DR: Agentic-KGR是一个通过多轮强化学习实现大语言模型与知识图谱协同进化的框架，解决了静态知识库的覆盖不足和时效性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有知识增强的大语言模型依赖静态知识库，存在覆盖不足和时效性差的问题，限制了在动态信息环境中的有效性。

Method: 提出三个关键创新：动态模式扩展机制、检索增强的记忆系统、可学习的多尺度提示压缩方法，通过多轮强化学习实现LLM与KG的协同进化。

Result: 实验结果显示在知识提取任务中显著优于监督基线和单轮RL方法，与GraphRAG集成后在问答任务中取得更高的准确性和知识覆盖率。

Conclusion: Agentic-KGR框架通过协同进化机制有效解决了知识库的覆盖和时效性问题，为动态信息环境下的知识增强提供了新思路。

Abstract: Current knowledge-enhanced large language models (LLMs) rely on static,
pre-constructed knowledge bases that suffer from coverage gaps and temporal
obsolescence, limiting their effectiveness in dynamic information environments.
We present Agentic-KGR, a novel framework enabling co-evolution between LLMs
and knowledge graphs (KGs) through multi-round reinforcement learning (RL). Our
approach introduces three key innovations: (1) a dynamic schema expansion
mechanism that systematically extends graph ontologies beyond pre-defined
boundaries during training; (2) a retrieval-augmented memory system enabling
synergistic co-evolution between model parameters and knowledge structures
through continuous optimization; (3) a learnable multi-scale prompt compression
approach that preserves critical information while reducing computational
complexity through adaptive sequence optimization. Experimental results
demonstrate substantial improvements over supervised baselines and single-round
RL approaches in knowledge extraction tasks. When integrated with GraphRAG, our
method achieves superior performance in downstream QA tasks, with significant
gains in both accuracy and knowledge coverage compared to existing methods.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了首个系统性的EHR表示方法基准测试，比较了时间序列、事件流和文本事件流三种范式，发现在不同临床场景下事件流模型表现最佳，且特征选择策略需根据具体临床任务调整。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 电子健康记录(EHR)支持临床预测的深度学习应用，但由于评估实践不一致，患者数据的最佳表示方法仍不明确。

Method: 建立标准化数据整理和评估流程，在MIMIC-IV(ICU任务)和EHRSHOT(纵向护理)两个临床数据集上，评估多种建模方法：时间序列(Transformers、MLP、LSTM、Retain)、事件流(CLMBR、计数模型)、文本事件流(8-200亿参数LLM)，并分析基于数据缺失的特征剪枝影响。

Result: 事件流模型始终提供最强性能；预训练模型(如CLMBR)在少样本设置中样本效率高，但简单计数模型在数据充足时也有竞争力；ICU预测中剪枝稀疏特征有益，而纵向任务中保留这些特征至关重要。

Conclusion: 通过统一可复现的流程，研究结果为根据临床背景和数据状况选择EHR表示提供了实用指导。

Abstract: Electronic Health Records (EHRs) enable deep learning for clinical
predictions, but the optimal method for representing patient data remains
unclear due to inconsistent evaluation practices. We present the first
systematic benchmark to compare EHR representation methods, including
multivariate time-series, event streams, and textual event streams for LLMs.
This benchmark standardises data curation and evaluation across two distinct
clinical settings: the MIMIC-IV dataset for ICU tasks (mortality, phenotyping)
and the EHRSHOT dataset for longitudinal care (30-day readmission, 1-year
pancreatic cancer). For each paradigm, we evaluate appropriate modelling
families--including Transformers, MLP, LSTMs and Retain for time-series, CLMBR
and count-based models for event streams, 8-20B LLMs for textual streams--and
analyse the impact of feature pruning based on data missingness. Our
experiments reveal that event stream models consistently deliver the strongest
performance. Pre-trained models like CLMBR are highly sample-efficient in
few-shot settings, though simpler count-based models can be competitive given
sufficient data. Furthermore, we find that feature selection strategies must be
adapted to the clinical setting: pruning sparse features improves ICU
predictions, while retaining them is critical for longitudinal tasks. Our
results, enabled by a unified and reproducible pipeline, provide practical
guidance for selecting EHR representations based on the clinical context and
data regime.

TL;DR: 提出了WASI方法，通过将训练限制在固定子空间来减少transformer模型的内存占用和计算成本，同时保持与标准训练相当的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI在日常生活中的普及，能耗和数据隐私成为重要问题。设备端学习能减少能耗并保护数据隐私，但现代神经网络规模扩大成为设备端训练的主要障碍。

Method: 应用基于子空间的训练方法到transformer模型，引入权重-激活子空间迭代(WASI)，通过将训练限制在模型关键信息所在的固定子空间来缓解反向传播的内存瓶颈。

Result: WASI在保持与标准训练相当准确性的同时，内存使用减少高达62倍，计算成本(FLOPs)减少高达2倍。在Raspberry Pi 5上，训练和推理速度比标准训练快约1.5倍。

Conclusion: WASI方法有效解决了transformer模型在设备端训练时的内存和计算瓶颈，为高效的设备端学习提供了可行方案。

Abstract: As AI increasingly shapes daily life, energy consumption and data privacy
have become pressing concerns. On-device learning trains models directly on
edge devices, cutting energy consumption and safeguarding data privacy.
However, the expanding scale of modern neural networks creates a major obstacle
for on-device training. Although prior work has concentrated on compact
convolutional architectures, we instead apply subspace-based training to
transformer models. Motivated by the idea that a model's essential information
lies in a fixed subspace, we introduce Weight-Activation Subspace Iteration
(WASI), a method that mitigates the memory bottleneck of backpropagation and
boosts inference efficiency in transformer models by restricting training to
this subspace. Our results demonstrate that WASI maintains accuracy comparable
to vanilla training while reducing memory usage by up to $62\times$ and
computational cost (FLOPs) by up to $2\times$. On a Raspberry Pi 5, WASI
achieves roughly $1.5\times$ faster training and inference than vanilla
training.

Result: Re-Basin方法能诱导合并模型获得对抗性和扰动鲁棒性，且参与合并的模型越多效果越强，但性能下降幅度比原论文报告更大。

Conclusion: Git Re-Basin在增强模型鲁棒性方面具有潜力，但实际性能损失需要重新评估，分层合并方案提供了更好的替代方法。

Abstract: This paper takes a closer look at Git Re-Basin, an interesting new approach
to merge trained models. We propose a hierarchical model merging scheme that
significantly outperforms the standard MergeMany algorithm. With our new
algorithm, we find that Re-Basin induces adversarial and perturbation
robustness into the merged models, with the effect becoming stronger the more
models participate in the hierarchical merging scheme. However, in our
experiments Re-Basin induces a much bigger performance drop than reported by
the original authors.

Motivation: 传统功能脑网络建模依赖局部成对交互，难以捕捉高阶依赖关系；现有超图建模方法计算负担重且依赖启发式方法，无法实现端到端学习。

Method: 提出全局约束导向的多分辨率(GCM)框架，整合4种全局约束(信号同步、被试身份、期望边数、数据标签)来学习4个不同分辨率水平(样本/被试/组/项目)的功能脑网络结构。

Result: 在5个数据集和2种任务设置下，相比9个基线和10个最先进方法，GCM实现了相对准确率提升30.6%和计算时间减少96.3%。

Conclusion: 该工作为功能脑网络结构学习提供了新视角，为认知神经科学的跨学科应用奠定了基础。

Abstract: Functional brain network (FBN) modeling often relies on local pairwise
interactions, whose limitation in capturing high-order dependencies is
theoretically analyzed in this paper. Meanwhile, the computational burden and
heuristic nature of current hypergraph modeling approaches hinder end-to-end
learning of FBN structures directly from data distributions. To address this,
we propose to extract high-order FBN structures under global constraints, and
implement this as a Global Constraints oriented Multi-resolution (GCM) FBN
structure learning framework. It incorporates 4 types of global constraint
(signal synchronization, subject identity, expected edge numbers, and data
labels) to enable learning FBN structures for 4 distinct levels
(sample/subject/group/project) of modeling resolution. Experimental results
demonstrate that GCM achieves up to a 30.6% improvement in relative accuracy
and a 96.3% reduction in computational time across 5 datasets and 2 task
settings, compared to 9 baselines and 10 state-of-the-art methods. Extensive
experiments validate the contributions of individual components and highlight
the interpretability of GCM. This work offers a novel perspective on FBN
structure learning and provides a foundation for interdisciplinary applications
in cognitive neuroscience. Code is publicly available on

Abstract: Non-determinism and non-reproducibility present significant challenges in
deep learning, leading to inconsistent results across runs and platforms. These
issues stem from two origins: random number generation and floating-point
computation. While randomness can be controlled through deterministic
configurations, floating-point inconsistencies remain largely unresolved. To
address this, we introduce RepDL, an open-source library that ensures
deterministic and bitwise-reproducible deep learning training and inference
across diverse computing environments. RepDL achieves this by enforcing correct
rounding and order invariance in floating-point computation. The source code is

Motivation: 理解深度网络中灾难性遗忘的深层原因，现有方法未能完全解决这一问题，需要从理论层面揭示其根本机制。

Method: 通过理论分析发现训练的低秩偏置导致新旧任务梯度在同一低维子空间中对齐，提出backGP方法来解决反向传播引起的对齐问题。

Result: backGP方法相比梯度投影方法平均减少遗忘10.8%，提高准确率12.7%。

Conclusion: 灾难性遗忘源于新任务训练对旧任务知识的对抗性攻击，backGP能有效缓解这一问题，为持续学习提供了新的理论视角和解决方案。

Abstract: Continual learning seeks the human-like ability to accumulate new skills in
machine intelligence. Its central challenge is catastrophic forgetting, whose
underlying cause has not been fully understood for deep networks. In this
paper, we demystify catastrophic forgetting by revealing that the new-task
training is implicitly an adversarial attack against the old-task knowledge.
Specifically, the new-task gradients automatically and accurately align with
the sharp directions of the old-task loss landscape, rapidly increasing the
old-task loss. This adversarial alignment is intriguingly counter-intuitive
because the sharp directions are too sparsely distributed to align with by
chance. To understand it, we theoretically show that it arises from training's
low-rank bias, which, through forward and backward propagation, confines the
two directions into the same low-dimensional subspace, facilitating alignment.
Gradient projection (GP) methods, a representative family of
forgetting-mitigating methods, reduce adversarial alignment caused by forward
propagation, but cannot address the alignment due to backward propagation. We
propose backGP to address it, which reduces forgetting by 10.8% and improves
accuracy by 12.7% on average over GP methods.

<details>

Motivation: 现有的提示优化方法仅限于文本，限制了多模态大语言模型的全部潜力，需要扩展到多模态空间。

Method: 提出MPO框架，通过保持对齐的联合更新来优化多模态提示，并使用贝叶斯选择策略基于先前评估指导候选提示选择。

Result: 在图像、视频甚至分子等多种模态上的实验表明，MPO优于领先的纯文本优化方法。

Conclusion: 多模态提示优化是实现多模态大语言模型潜力的关键步骤。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable success, and their
multimodal expansions (MLLMs) further unlock capabilities spanning images,
videos, and other modalities beyond text. However, despite this shift, prompt
optimization approaches, designed to reduce the burden of manual prompt
crafting while maximizing performance, remain confined to text, ultimately
limiting the full potential of MLLMs. Motivated by this gap, we introduce the
new problem of multimodal prompt optimization, which expands the prior
definition of prompt optimization to the multimodal space defined by the pairs
of textual and non-textual prompts. To tackle this problem, we then propose the
Multimodal Prompt Optimizer (MPO), a unified framework that not only performs
the joint optimization of multimodal prompts through alignment-preserving
updates but also guides the selection process of candidate prompts by
leveraging earlier evaluations as priors in a Bayesian-based selection
strategy. Through extensive experiments across diverse modalities that go
beyond text, such as images, videos, and even molecules, we demonstrate that
MPO outperforms leading text-only optimization methods, establishing multimodal
prompt optimization as a crucial step to realizing the potential of MLLMs.

Result: 实验表明该方法显著提高了学习效率、泛化能力和鲁棒性，特别是在从次优专家数据学习时表现突出。

Conclusion: 通过将流匹配的表示能力与简单MLP策略的在线学习效率相结合，成功解决了流匹配策略在线学习中的挑战，实现了更好的泛化性能。

Abstract: Flow Matching (FM) has shown remarkable ability in modeling complex
distributions and achieves strong performance in offline imitation learning for
cloning expert behaviors. However, despite its behavioral cloning
expressiveness, FM-based policies are inherently limited by their lack of
environmental interaction and exploration. This leads to poor generalization in
unseen scenarios beyond the expert demonstrations, underscoring the necessity
of online interaction with environment. Unfortunately, optimizing FM policies
via online interaction is challenging and inefficient due to instability in
gradient computation and high inference costs. To address these issues, we
propose to let a student policy with simple MLP structure explore the
environment and be online updated via RL algorithm with a reward model. This
reward model is associated with a teacher FM model, containing rich information
of expert data distribution. Furthermore, the same teacher FM model is utilized
to regularize the student policy's behavior to stabilize policy learning. Due
to the student's simple architecture, we avoid the gradient instability of FM
policies and enable efficient online exploration, while still leveraging the
expressiveness of the teacher FM model. Extensive experiments show that our
approach significantly enhances learning efficiency, generalization, and
robustness, especially when learning from suboptimal expert data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的机器学习模型虽然能成功预测化学反应可行性，但缺乏透明度和可解释性，需要开发能够解释预测结果的机制。

Method: 引入质蕴涵解释的新表述，专门针对化学反应预测领域，并提出了在小规模反应预测任务中计算此类解释的算法。

Result: 初步实验表明，质蕴涵解释保守地捕捉了真实解释，虽然常包含冗余的键和原子，但能一致地捕获预测反应可行性所必需的分子属性。

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效识别化学反应预测中的关键分子特征，为自动化合成规划提供更透明的决策支持。

Abstract: Machine learning models that predict the feasibility of chemical reactions
have become central to automated synthesis planning. Despite their predictive
success, these models often lack transparency and interpretability. We
introduce a novel formulation of prime implicant explanations--also known as
minimally sufficient reasons--tailored to this domain, and propose an algorithm
for computing such explanations in small-scale reaction prediction tasks.
Preliminary experiments demonstrate that our notion of prime implicant
explanations conservatively captures the ground truth explanations. That is,
such explanations often contain redundant bonds and atoms but consistently
capture the molecular attributes that are essential for predicting reaction
feasibility.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有协作框架假设所有参与者同时加入，但现实中由于数据清理时间长、法律障碍或不知情等原因，参与者可能在不同时间加入。早期参与者承担更高风险并鼓励观望者贡献，因此应获得更高奖励。

Conclusion: 提出的时间感知数据共享框架能够公平奖励早期参与者，促进协作数据共享和机器学习。

Abstract: In collaborative data sharing and machine learning, multiple parties
aggregate their data resources to train a machine learning model with better
model performance. However, as the parties incur data collection costs, they
are only willing to do so when guaranteed incentives, such as fairness and
individual rationality. Existing frameworks assume that all parties join the
collaboration simultaneously, which does not hold in many real-world scenarios.
Due to the long processing time for data cleaning, difficulty in overcoming
legal barriers, or unawareness, the parties may join the collaboration at
different times. In this work, we propose the following perspective: As a party
who joins earlier incurs higher risk and encourages the contribution from other
wait-and-see parties, that party should receive a reward of higher value for
sharing data earlier. To this end, we propose a fair and time-aware data
sharing framework, including novel time-aware incentives. We develop new
methods for deciding reward values to satisfy these incentives. We further
illustrate how to generate model rewards that realize the reward values and
empirically demonstrate the properties of our methods on synthetic and
real-world datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 发展中经济体的金融数据由于频繁且不可预测的宏观经济冲击而高度不稳定，导致机器学习模型性能下降。这是首批研究这些地区金融数据集漂移缓解方法的研究之一。

Method: 研究使用合成异常值这一较少探索的方法来提高模型对未知冲击的稳定性，并引入了一个两级框架来评估性能下降程度和冲击严重性。

Result: 在宏观经济表格数据集上的实验表明，添加少量合成异常值通常比基线模型提高了稳定性，但最佳添加量因数据集和模型而异。

Conclusion: 合成异常值可以有效缓解金融机器学习模型在发展中经济体中的漂移问题，但需要根据具体数据集和模型调整使用策略。

Abstract: Machine Learning models in finance are highly susceptible to model drift,
where predictive performance declines as data distributions shift. This issue
is especially acute in developing economies such as those in Central Asia and
the Caucasus - including Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, and Azerbaijan -
where frequent and unpredictable macroeconomics shocks destabilize financial
data. To the best of our knowledge, this is among the first studies to examine
drift mitigation methods on financial datasets from these regions. We
investigate the use of synthetic outliers, a largely unexplored approach, to
improve model stability against unforeseen shocks. To evaluate effectiveness,
we introduce a two-level framework that measures both the extent of performance
degradation and the severity of shocks. Our experiments on macroeconomic
tabular datasets show that adding a small proportion of synthetic outliers
generally improves stability compared to baseline models, though the optimal
amount varies by dataset and model

Conclusion: 该研究为提示工程提供了系统性的数据集分析和优化方法，数据集和代码已公开可用，有助于推动更有效的提示设计和LLM应用。

Abstract: A prompt is a natural language instruction that defines a specific task for a
large language model (LLM) and serves as the primary interface for human-LLM
interaction. With the growing deployment of LLMs, diverse prompt datasets are
emerging from platforms such as GitHub and social media. These datasets span a
wide array of applications and content types, facilitating both broader LLM
utilization and improved prompt engineering. In this work, we--for the first
time--have compiled an extensive list of prompt datasets sourced from various
channels, representing a spectrum of downstream tasks, languages, engineering
techniques, attributes, and modalities. We select key representative datasets
for systematic analysis, revealing commonalities and differences in prompt
construction across categories, distinguishing them from other text corpora
like literature and web. We further propose a prompt optimization approach that
leverages syntactic embeddings of part-of-speech and dependency structures. By
identifying a centroid representation of prompts and guiding LLMs to rewrite
prompts toward this centroid, our method improves the meaningfulness of model
outputs. We have made our datasets and code available.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统Modelica模型中的代数环会导致仿真效率低下，且存在多解模糊问题，需要一种能有效替代代数环并保持准确性的方法。

Method: 使用前馈神经网络，在损失函数中直接使用代数环的残差进行训练，无需监督数据，通过残差训练策略确保收敛到一致解。

Result: 在IEEE 14-Bus系统测试中，相比传统仿真方法实现了60%的仿真时间减少，同时通过误差控制机制保持了相同的精度水平。

Conclusion: 该方法成功解决了代数环替代问题，显著提升了仿真效率，为大规模系统建模提供了有效的机器学习解决方案。

Abstract: This paper presents a residual-informed machine learning approach for
replacing algebraic loops in equation-based Modelica models with neural network
surrogates. A feedforward neural network is trained using the residual (error)
of the algebraic loop directly in its loss function, eliminating the need for a
supervised dataset. This training strategy also resolves the issue of ambiguous
solutions, allowing the surrogate to converge to a consistent solution rather
than averaging multiple valid ones. Applied to the large-scale IEEE 14-Bus
system, our method achieves a 60% reduction in simulation time compared to
conventional simulations, while maintaining the same level of accuracy through
error control mechanisms.

Conclusion: 本文为多智能体模仿学习建立了完整的理论框架，明确了非交互式方法的根本限制，并提供了高效的交互式解决方案，填补了该领域的理论空白。

Abstract: We close open theoretical gaps in Multi-Agent Imitation Learning (MAIL) by
characterizing the limits of non-interactive MAIL and presenting the first
interactive algorithm with near-optimal sample complexity. In the
non-interactive setting, we prove a statistical lower bound that identifies the
all-policy deviation concentrability coefficient as the fundamental complexity
measure, and we show that Behavior Cloning (BC) is rate-optimal. For the
interactive setting, we introduce a framework that combines reward-free
reinforcement learning with interactive MAIL and instantiate it with an
algorithm, MAIL-WARM. It improves the best previously known sample complexity
from $\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon^{-8})$ to $\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon^{-2}),$
matching the dependence on $\varepsilon$ implied by our lower bound. Finally,
we provide numerical results that support our theory and illustrate, in
environments such as grid worlds, where Behavior Cloning fails to learn.

Motivation: 现有对齐方法主要在训练阶段进行，成本高且不灵活，无法适应新要求。推理时对齐方法仍需访问模型内部，对第三方不实用。

Method: 将安全与有用性权衡建模为两人零和博弈，使用线性规划求解器在推理时计算均衡策略。

Result: 证明了黑盒安全对齐的可行性，为资源受限的组织提供了可扩展的安全执行途径。

Conclusion: 该框架为各种利益相关者提供了在快速发展的LLM生态系统中实施安全的可访问路径。

Abstract: Ensuring that large language models (LLMs) comply with safety requirements is
a central challenge in AI deployment. Existing alignment approaches primarily
operate during training, such as through fine-tuning or reinforcement learning
from human feedback, but these methods are costly and inflexible, requiring
retraining whenever new requirements arise. Recent efforts toward
inference-time alignment mitigate some of these limitations but still assume
access to model internals, which is impractical, and not suitable for third
party stakeholders who do not have access to the models. In this work, we
propose a model-independent, black-box framework for safety alignment that does
not require retraining or access to the underlying LLM architecture. As a proof
of concept, we address the problem of trading off between generating safe but
uninformative answers versus helpful yet potentially risky ones. We formulate
this dilemma as a two-player zero-sum game whose minimax equilibrium captures
the optimal balance between safety and helpfulness. LLM agents operationalize
this framework by leveraging a linear programming solver at inference time to
compute equilibrium strategies. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of
black-box safety alignment, offering a scalable and accessible pathway for
stakeholders, including smaller organizations and entities in
resource-constrained settings, to enforce safety across rapidly evolving LLM
ecosystems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准评估指标往往无法反映人类偏好，而人工评估虽然更可靠但成本高且噪声大。现有Bradley-Terry方法要么忽略评分者变异性，要么缺乏收敛保证。

Method: 提出BBQ模型，显式建模评分者质量，使用期望最大化算法保证单调似然收敛，对不可靠参与者进行降权或移除。

Result: BBQ实现了更快的收敛速度、良好校准的不确定性估计，以及相比基线Bradley-Terry模型更鲁棒和可解释的排名，即使在有噪声或众包评分者的情况下。

Conclusion: 该框架能够实现更可靠和成本效益更高的生成模型人类评估。

Abstract: Evaluating generative models is challenging because standard metrics often
fail to reflect human preferences. Human evaluations are more reliable but
costly and noisy, as participants vary in expertise, attention, and diligence.
Pairwise comparisons improve consistency, yet aggregating them into overall
quality scores requires careful modeling. Bradley-Terry-based methods update
item scores from comparisons, but existing approaches either ignore rater
variability or lack convergence guarantees, limiting robustness and
interpretability. We introduce BBQ, a Bayesian Bradley-Terry variant that
explicitly models rater quality, downweighting or removing unreliable
participants, and provides guaranteed monotonic likelihood convergence through
an Expectation-Maximization algorithm. Empirical results show that BBQ achieves
faster convergence, well-calibrated uncertainty estimates, and more robust,
interpretable rankings compared to baseline Bradley-Terry models, even with
noisy or crowdsourced raters. This framework enables more reliable and
cost-effective human evaluation of generative models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 铁路网络的运营效率因列车延误的级联效应而受到持续影响，准确预测延误传播对实时交通管理至关重要。现有研究虽然使用图神经网络建模铁路网络结构，但缺乏能够提供网络范围多步自回归预测并同时提供实时可解释解释的框架。

Method: 开发了一个两阶段自回归图注意力网络(GAT)模型，将系统表示为运营事件(到达和出发)的时空图，并加入了站台和车站拥堵等细粒度特征。使用顺序k步前向预测协议模拟真实世界条件进行严格评估。

Result: 虽然提出的GATv2模型在纯误差指标(MAE)上被更简单的持续性基线模型挑战，但在延误事件分类精度方面始终表现更高，这对于可靠的决策支持工具来说是关键优势。

Conclusion: 该框架为铁路网络提供了实时、可解释的多步延误预测能力，尽管在误差指标上不占优势，但在延误事件分类精度方面具有重要价值，适合作为决策支持工具部署。

Abstract: The operational efficiency of railway networks, a cornerstone of modern
economies, is persistently undermined by the cascading effects of train delays.
Accurately forecasting this delay propagation is a critical challenge for
real-time traffic management. While recent research has leveraged Graph Neural
Networks (GNNs) to model the network structure of railways, a significant gap
remains in developing frameworks that provide multi-step autoregressive
forecasts at a network-wide scale, while simultaneously offering the live,
interpretable explanations needed for decision support. This paper addresses
this gap by developing and evaluating a novel XGeoAI framework for live,
explainable, multi-step train delay forecasting. The core of this work is a
two-stage, autoregressive Graph Attention Network (GAT) model, trained on a
real-world dataset covering over 40% of the Dutch railway network. The model
represents the system as a spatio-temporal graph of operational events
(arrivals and departures) and is enriched with granular features, including
platform and station congestion. To test its viability for live deployment, the
model is rigorously evaluated using a sequential, k-step-ahead forecasting
protocol that simulates real-world conditions where prediction errors can
compound. The results demonstrate that while the proposed GATv2 model is
challenged on pure error metrics (MAE) by a simpler Persistence baseline, it
achieves consistently higher precision in classifying delay events -- a crucial
advantage for a reliable decision support tool.

Method: 应用全高斯牛顿预条件到150M参数的Transformer模型，并与SOAP、Muon等基线方法比较。

Result: 全GN更新相比基线方法减少了5.4倍训练迭代次数，层间GN预条件器性能接近全GN方法。

Conclusion: GN近似对预条件非常有效，层间Hessian结构包含足够信息获得大部分增益，当前近似方法与理想层间预言机存在显著性能差距。

Abstract: Recent efforts to accelerate LLM pretraining have focused on
computationally-efficient approximations that exploit second-order structure.
This raises a key question for large-scale training: how much performance is
forfeited by these approximations? To probe this question, we establish a
practical upper bound on iteration complexity by applying full Gauss-Newton
(GN) preconditioning to transformer models of up to 150M parameters. Our
experiments show that full GN updates yield substantial gains over existing
optimizers, achieving a 5.4x reduction in training iterations compared to
strong baselines like SOAP and Muon. Furthermore, we find that a precise
layerwise GN preconditioner, which ignores cross-layer information, nearly
matches the performance of the full GN method. Collectively, our results
suggest: (1) the GN approximation is highly effective for preconditioning,
implying higher-order loss terms may not be critical for convergence speed; (2)
the layerwise Hessian structure contains sufficient information to achieve most
of these potential gains; and (3) a significant performance gap exists between
current approximate methods and an idealized layerwise oracle.

Motivation: 尽管softmax注意力在序列模型中表现出色，但其二次复杂度限制了可扩展性，而线性替代方案如SSMs虽然效率更高，但它们在信息处理方面的根本差异尚未被充分理解。

Method: 利用动力学系统框架将不同类型的注意力机制表示为动力学系统，通过分析其特征值谱与SSMs进行系统性比较，并在多种序列模型和基准测试上进行实证分析。

Conclusion: 特征值分析为解释、理解并最终改进序列模型能力提供了一个原则性的度量标准，强化了其在模型分析中的重要地位。

Abstract: Although softmax attention drives state-of-the-art performance for sequence
models, its quadratic complexity limits scalability, motivating linear
alternatives such as state space models (SSMs). While these alternatives
improve efficiency, their fundamental differences in information processing
remain poorly understood. In this work, we leverage the recently proposed
dynamical systems framework to represent softmax, norm and linear attention as
dynamical systems, enabling a structured comparison with SSMs by analyzing
their respective eigenvalue spectra. Since eigenvalues capture essential
aspects of dynamical system behavior, we conduct an extensive empirical
analysis across diverse sequence models and benchmarks. We first show that
eigenvalues influence essential aspects of memory and long-range dependency
modeling, revealing spectral signatures that align with task requirements.
Building on these insights, we then investigate how architectural modifications
in sequence models impact both eigenvalue spectra and task performance. This
correspondence further strengthens the position of eigenvalue analysis as a
principled metric for interpreting, understanding, and ultimately improving the
capabilities of sequence models.

Method: CHUCKLE框架通过众包数据集中的标注者一致性和对齐度来定义样本难度，假设对人类具有挑战性的样本对机器学习模型同样困难。

Result: 实验结果显示，CHUCKLE使LSTM的相对平均准确率提高了6.56%，Transformer提高了1.61%，同时减少了梯度更新次数。

Conclusion: 基于人类感知的课程学习框架CHUCKLE能够同时提升训练效率和模型鲁棒性，在情感识别任务中表现出色。

Abstract: Curriculum learning (CL) structures training from simple to complex samples,
facilitating progressive learning. However, existing CL approaches for emotion
recognition often rely on heuristic, data-driven, or model-based definitions of
sample difficulty, neglecting the difficulty for human perception, a critical
factor in subjective tasks like emotion recognition. We propose CHUCKLE
(Crowdsourced Human Understanding Curriculum for Knowledge Led Emotion
Recognition), a perception-driven CL framework that leverages annotator
agreement and alignment in crowd-sourced datasets to define sample difficulty,
under the assumption that clips challenging for humans are similarly hard for
machine learning models. Empirical results suggest that CHUCKLE increases the
relative mean accuracy by 6.56% for LSTMs and 1.61% for Transformers over
non-curriculum baselines, while reducing the number of gradient updates,
thereby enhancing both training efficiency and model robustness.

Motivation: 现有RL方法在任务难度超出模型能力时会出现奖励稀疏和训练效率低下的问题，先前工作尝试使用离策略数据但往往误导策略更新，核心问题是训练亲和力低。

Method: 提出HINT框架，引入Affinity指标监控探索效率和训练稳定性，通过自适应提示机制提供启发式提示而非直接答案，引导模型自主发现解决方案。

Result: 在数学推理任务上的广泛实验表明，HINT始终优于现有方法，在不同规模模型上实现了最先进的结果，同时展现出更稳定的学习和更高的数据效率。

Conclusion: HINT框架通过改善训练亲和力，有效解决了RL训练中的奖励稀疏问题，提升了模型在复杂推理任务上的性能表现。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has become a key driver for enhancing the long
chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs).
However, prevalent methods like GRPO often fail when task difficulty exceeds
the model's capacity, leading to reward sparsity and inefficient training.
While prior work attempts to mitigate this using off-policy data, such as
mixing RL with Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) or using hints, they often misguide
policy updates In this work, we identify a core issue underlying these
failures, which we term low training affinity. This condition arises from a
large distributional mismatch between external guidance and the model's policy.
To diagnose this, we introduce Affinity, the first quantitative metric for
monitoring exploration efficiency and training stability. To improve Affinity,
we propose HINT: Helping Ineffective rollouts Navigate Towards effectiveness,
an adaptive hinting framework. Instead of providing direct answers, HINT
supplies heuristic hints that guide the model to discover solutions on its own,
preserving its autonomous reasoning capabilities. Extensive experiments on
mathematical reasoning tasks show that HINT consistently outperforms existing
methods, achieving state-of-the-art results with models of various scales,
while also demonstrating significantly more stable learning and greater data
efficiency.Code is available on Github.

systematically compare such architectures, we develop a unified framework that
makes this output operation explicit, by casting the linear combination
coefficients as the outputs of autonomous linear dynamical systems driven by
impulse inputs. This viewpoint, in spirit substantially different from
approaches focusing on connecting linear RNNs with linear attention, reveals a
common mathematical theme across diverse architectures and crucially captures
softmax attention, on top of RNNs, SSMs, and related models. In contrast to new
model proposals that are commonly evaluated on benchmarks, we derive design
principles linking architectural choices to model properties. Thereby
identifying tradeoffs between expressivity and efficient implementation,
geometric constraints on input selectivity, and stability conditions for
numerically stable training and information retention. By connecting several
insights and observations from recent literature, the framework both explains
empirical successes of recent designs and provides guiding principles for
systematically designing new sequence model architectures.

Abstract: Radio frequency fingerprint identification (RFFI) is a critical technique for
wireless network security, leveraging intrinsic hardware-level imperfections
introduced during device manufacturing to enable precise transmitter
identification. While deep neural networks have shown remarkable capability in
extracting discriminative features, their real-world deployment is hindered by
receiver-induced variability. In practice, RF fingerprint signals comprise
transmitter-specific features as well as channel distortions and
receiver-induced biases. Although channel equalization can mitigate channel
noise, receiver-induced feature shifts remain largely unaddressed, causing the
RFFI models to overfit to receiver-specific patterns. This limitation is
particularly problematic when training and evaluation share the same receiver,
as replacing the receiver in deployment can cause substantial performance
degradation. To tackle this challenge, we propose an RFFI framework robust to
cross-receiver variability, integrating adversarial training and style transfer
to explicitly disentangle transmitter and receiver features. By enforcing
domain-invariant representation learning, our method isolates genuine hardware
signatures from receiver artifacts, ensuring robustness against receiver
changes. Extensive experiments on multi-receiver datasets demonstrate that our
approach consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving up to a
10% improvement in average accuracy across diverse receiver settings.

Abstract: Learning on temporal graphs has become a central topic in graph
representation learning, with numerous benchmarks indicating the strong
performance of state-of-the-art models. However, recent work has raised
concerns about the reliability of benchmark results, noting issues with
commonly used evaluation protocols and the surprising competitiveness of simple
heuristics. This contrast raises the question of which properties of the
underlying graphs temporal graph learning models actually use to form their
predictions. We address this by systematically evaluating seven models on their
ability to capture eight fundamental attributes related to the link structure
of temporal graphs. These include structural characteristics such as density,
temporal patterns such as recency, and edge formation mechanisms such as
homophily. Using both synthetic and real-world datasets, we analyze how well
models learn these attributes. Our findings reveal a mixed picture: models
capture some attributes well but fail to reproduce others. With this, we expose
important limitations. Overall, we believe that our results provide practical
insights for the application of temporal graph learning models, and motivate
more interpretability-driven evaluations in temporal graph learning research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 权重初始化在训练开始时控制信号传播和梯度流动，对训练稳定性和收敛速度有重要影响。本文旨在通过理论分析和实证研究，连接经典初始化原则与现代transformer行为，为鲁棒训练提供实用指导。

Method: 采用对数扫描初始标准差的方法，在两种架构上进行研究：紧凑ReLU多层感知机和GPT-2风格transformer。通过控制比较不同初始化方法，并跟踪transformer预训练过程中各层Q/K/V权重方差的变化。

Result: 发现1e-2到1e-1的标准差范围形成宽泛的稳定性带；Kaiming初始化在ReLU网络下比Xavier收敛更快更稳定；在12层GPT-2模型中，观察到层间权重方差的深度依赖性均衡：浅层快速扩展，深层变化更渐进。

Conclusion: 这些结果将经典初始化原理与现代transformer行为联系起来，为鲁棒训练提供了简单实用的方法，强调了初始化对深度网络训练动态的重要影响。

Abstract: Weight initialization governs signal propagation and gradient flow at the
start of training. This paper offers a theory-grounded and empirically
validated study across two regimes: compact ReLU multilayer perceptrons and
GPT-2-style transformers. First, a logarithmic sweep of the initial standard
deviation maps vanishing and exploding regimes and identifies a broad stability
band with standard deviations between 1e-2 and 1e-1. Second, a controlled
comparison shows that Kaiming (fan-in) initialization converges faster and more
stably than Xavier under ReLU, consistent with variance-preserving theory.
Third, in a from-scratch 12-layer GPT-2-style model, this paper tracks
layerwise Q/K/V weight variance through pretraining and observe depth-dependent
equilibration into narrow bands: shallow layers expand rapidly while deeper
layers change more gradually. Together, these results connect classic
initialization principles with modern transformer behavior and yield simple,
practical recipes for robust training.

Abstract: We study an online stochastic matching problem in which an algorithm
sequentially matches $U$ users to $K$ arms, aiming to maximize cumulative
reward over $T$ rounds under budget constraints. Without structural
assumptions, computing the optimal matching is NP-hard, making online learning
computationally infeasible. To overcome this barrier, we focus on
\emph{single-peaked preferences} -- a well-established structure in social
choice theory, where users' preferences are unimodal with respect to a common
order over arms. We devise an efficient algorithm for the offline budgeted
matching problem, and leverage it into an efficient online algorithm with a
regret of $\tilde O(UKT^{2/3})$. Our approach relies on a novel PQ tree-based
order approximation method. If the single-peaked structure is known, we develop
an efficient UCB-like algorithm that achieves a regret bound of $\tilde
O(U\sqrt{TK})$.

TL;DR: 本文发现交叉注意力机制中存在正交对齐现象，即交叉注意力能够发现查询输入中不存在的新信息，这种机制与传统的残差对齐机制可以共存，且能显著提升模型性能。

Motivation: 虽然交叉注意力在跨域序列推荐中被广泛使用，但其底层机制尚未被完全理解。大多数研究将其解释为残差对齐，但本文旨在探索交叉注意力中可能存在的其他对齐机制。

Method: 通过300多次实验分析交叉注意力机制，发现当查询输入与交叉注意力输出正交时，模型性能显著提升。这种正交对齐现象是自然涌现的，无需显式正交约束。

Result: 实验表明，正交对齐现象能够提升模型缩放定律，包含交叉注意力模块的基线模型在参数匹配条件下优于其他基线，实现了更优的准确率-参数比。

Conclusion: 正交对齐现象为多模态研究中的参数高效缩放提供了新的研究方向，交叉注意力机制不仅能移除冗余信息，还能发现新的信息维度。

Abstract: Cross-domain sequential recommendation (CDSR) aims to align heterogeneous
user behavior sequences collected from different domains. While cross-attention
is widely used to enhance alignment and improve recommendation performance, its
underlying mechanism is not fully understood. Most researchers interpret
cross-attention as residual alignment, where the output is generated by
removing redundant and preserving non-redundant information from the query
input by referencing another domain data which is input key and value. Beyond
the prevailing view, we introduce Orthogonal Alignment, a phenomenon in which
cross-attention discovers novel information that is not present in the query
input, and further argue that those two contrasting alignment mechanisms can
co-exist in recommendation models We find that when the query input and output
of cross-attention are orthogonal, model performance improves over 300
experiments. Notably, Orthogonal Alignment emerges naturally, without any
explicit orthogonality constraints. Our key insight is that Orthogonal
Alignment emerges naturally because it improves scaling law. We show that
baselines additionally incorporating cross-attention module outperform
parameter-matched baselines, achieving a superior accuracy-per-model parameter.
We hope these findings offer new directions for parameter-efficient scaling in
multi-modal research.

TL;DR: 本文证明了均匀缩放流（USFs）在理论上连接了深度单类分类和密度估计两种异常检测范式，通过最大似然训练USFs等价于Deep SVDD目标，并提出了将USFs作为非USFs的替代方案来提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前无监督异常检测主要围绕深度单类分类（如Deep SVDD）和密度估计（如归一化流）两种范式展开，但两者之间的理论联系尚未明确。本文旨在揭示这两种方法的内在联系，并探索更优的异常检测架构。

Method: 通过理论分析证明均匀缩放流（USFs）在最大似然训练下等价于Deep SVDD目标，并引入防止表示崩溃的正则化。将USFs作为非USFs的替代方案应用于现代异常检测架构。

Result: 实验表明，在多个基准测试和模型骨干网络中，用USFs替代非USFs能带来一致的性能提升和显著改善的训练稳定性，适用于图像级和像素级检测任务。

Conclusion: USFs统一了两种主要的异常检测范式，不仅推进了理论理解，还提升了实际性能，建议将USFs作为非USFs的即插即用替代方案。

Abstract: Unsupervised anomaly detection is often framed around two widely studied
paradigms. Deep one-class classification, exemplified by Deep SVDD, learns
compact latent representations of normality, while density estimators realized
by normalizing flows directly model the likelihood of nominal data. In this
work, we show that uniformly scaling flows (USFs), normalizing flows with a
constant Jacobian determinant, precisely connect these approaches.
Specifically, we prove how training a USF via maximum-likelihood reduces to a
Deep SVDD objective with a unique regularization that inherently prevents
representational collapse. This theoretical bridge implies that USFs inherit
both the density faithfulness of flows and the distance-based reasoning of
one-class methods. We further demonstrate that USFs induce a tighter alignment
between negative log-likelihood and latent norm than either Deep SVDD or
non-USFs, and how recent hybrid approaches combining one-class objectives with
VAEs can be naturally extended to USFs. Consequently, we advocate using USFs as
a drop-in replacement for non-USFs in modern anomaly detection architectures.
Empirically, this substitution yields consistent performance gains and
substantially improved training stability across multiple benchmarks and model
backbones for both image-level and pixel-level detection. These results unify
two major anomaly detection paradigms, advancing both theoretical understanding
and practical performance.

Motivation: 现有AI控制协议将监控器作为核心防御点，但攻击者可能了解协议细节和监控模型，这构成了安全漏洞。

Method: 研究自适应攻击，攻击者了解协议和监控模型，通过嵌入公开已知或零样本提示注入来绕过监控。

Result: 前沿模型能够持续绕过各种监控器，在两个主要AI控制基准上完成恶意任务。Defer-to-Resample协议甚至适得其反，其重采样放大了提示注入。

Conclusion: 对监控模型的自适应攻击是当前控制协议的主要盲点，应成为未来AI控制机制评估的标准组成部分。

Abstract: AI control protocols serve as a defense mechanism to stop untrusted LLM
agents from causing harm in autonomous settings. Prior work treats this as a
security problem, stress testing with exploits that use the deployment context
to subtly complete harmful side tasks, such as backdoor insertion. In practice,
most AI control protocols are fundamentally based on LLM monitors, which can
become a central point of failure. We study adaptive attacks by an untrusted
model that knows the protocol and the monitor model, which is plausible if the
untrusted model was trained with a later knowledge cutoff or can search for
this information autonomously. We instantiate a simple adaptive attack vector
by which the attacker embeds publicly known or zero-shot prompt injections in
the model outputs. Using this tactic, frontier models consistently evade
diverse monitors and complete malicious tasks on two main AI control
benchmarks. The attack works universally against current protocols that rely on
a monitor. Furthermore, the recent Defer-to-Resample protocol even backfires,
as its resampling amplifies the prompt injection and effectively reframes it as
a best-of-$n$ attack. In general, adaptive attacks on monitor models represent
a major blind spot in current control protocols and should become a standard
component of evaluations for future AI control mechanisms.

Abstract: Latent manifolds of autoencoders provide low-dimensional representations of
data, which can be studied from a geometric perspective. We propose to describe
these latent manifolds as implicit submanifolds of some ambient latent space.
Based on this, we develop tools for a discrete Riemannian calculus
approximating classical geometric operators. These tools are robust against
inaccuracies of the implicit representation often occurring in practical
examples. To obtain a suitable implicit representation, we propose to learn an
approximate projection onto the latent manifold by minimizing a denoising
objective. This approach is independent of the underlying autoencoder and
supports the use of different Riemannian geometries on the latent manifolds.
The framework in particular enables the computation of geodesic paths
connecting given end points and shooting geodesics via the Riemannian
exponential maps on latent manifolds. We evaluate our approach on various
autoencoders trained on synthetic and real data.

Abstract: Machine learning for weather prediction increasingly relies on ensemble
methods to provide probabilistic forecasts. Diffusion-based models have shown
strong performance in Limited-Area Modeling (LAM) but remain computationally
expensive at sampling time. Building on the success of global weather
forecasting models trained based on Continuous Ranked Probability Score (CRPS),
we introduce CRPS-LAM, a probabilistic LAM forecasting model trained with a
CRPS-based objective. By sampling and injecting a single latent noise vector
into the model, CRPS-LAM generates ensemble members in a single forward pass,
achieving sampling speeds up to 39 times faster than a diffusion-based model.
We evaluate the model on the MEPS regional dataset, where CRPS-LAM matches the
low errors of diffusion models. By retaining also fine-scale forecast details,
the method stands out as an effective approach for probabilistic regional
weather forecasting

Conclusion: 局部框架为私有采样提供了更实用的理论分析工具，特别是在存在公共数据分布的场景下，局部最优采样器具有更好的性能表现。

Abstract: We study the problem of sampling from a distribution under local differential
privacy (LDP). Given a private distribution $P \in \mathcal{P}$, the goal is to
generate a single sample from a distribution that remains close to $P$ in
$f$-divergence while satisfying the constraints of LDP. This task captures the
fundamental challenge of producing realistic-looking data under strong privacy
guarantees. While prior work by Park et al. (NeurIPS'24) focuses on global
minimax-optimality across a class of distributions, we take a local
perspective. Specifically, we examine the minimax risk in a neighborhood around
a fixed distribution $P_0$, and characterize its exact value, which depends on
both $P_0$ and the privacy level. Our main result shows that the local minimax
risk is determined by the global minimax risk when the distribution class
$\mathcal{P}$ is restricted to a neighborhood around $P_0$. To establish this,
we (1) extend previous work from pure LDP to the more general functional LDP
framework, and (2) prove that the globally optimal functional LDP sampler
yields the optimal local sampler when constrained to distributions near $P_0$.
Building on this, we also derive a simple closed-form expression for the
locally minimax-optimal samplers which does not depend on the choice of
$f$-divergence. We further argue that this local framework naturally models
private sampling with public data, where the public data distribution is
represented by $P_0$. In this setting, we empirically compare our locally
optimal sampler to existing global methods, and demonstrate that it
consistently outperforms global minimax samplers.

Abstract: We study online adversarial imitation learning (AIL), where an agent learns
from offline expert demonstrations and interacts with the environment online
without access to rewards. Despite strong empirical results, the benefits of
online interaction and the impact of stochasticity remain poorly understood. We
address these gaps by introducing a model-based AIL algorithm (MB-AIL) and
establish its horizon-free, second-order sample-complexity guarantees under
general function approximations for both expert data and reward-free
interactions. These second-order bounds provide an instance-dependent result
that can scale with the variance of returns under the relevant policies and
therefore tighten as the system approaches determinism. Together with
second-order, information-theoretic lower bounds on a newly constructed
hard-instance family, we show that MB-AIL attains minimax-optimal sample
complexity for online interaction (up to logarithmic factors) with limited
expert demonstrations and matches the lower bound for expert demonstrations in
terms of the dependence on horizon $H$, precision $\epsilon$ and the policy
variance $\sigma^2$. Experiments further validate our theoretical findings and
demonstrate that a practical implementation of MB-AIL matches or surpasses the
sample efficiency of existing methods.

Abstract: Kidneys are the filter of the human body. About 10% of the global population
is thought to be affected by Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD), which causes kidney
function to decline. To protect in danger patients from additional kidney
damage, effective risk evaluation of CKD and appropriate CKD monitoring are
crucial. Due to quick and precise detection capabilities, Machine Learning
models can help practitioners accomplish this goal efficiently; therefore, an
enormous number of diagnosis systems and processes in the healthcare sector
nowadays are relying on machine learning due to its disease prediction
capability. In this study, we designed and suggested disease predictive
computer-aided designs for the diagnosis of CKD. The dataset for CKD is
attained from the repository of machine learning of UCL, with a few missing
values; those are filled in using "mean-mode" and "Random sampling method"
strategies. After successfully achieving the missing data, eight ML techniques
(Random Forest, SVM, Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, KNN, XGBoost, Decision
Tree, and AdaBoost) were used to establish models, and the performance
evaluation comparisons among the result accuracies are measured by the
techniques to find the machine learning models with the highest accuracy. Among
them, Random Forest as well as Logistic Regression showed an outstanding 99%

Result: 在美国东海岸多个流域37年真实数据集上的评估表明，Geo-STARS在跨区域和跨尺度的泛化性能优于现有最先进基线方法。

Conclusion: Geo-STARS展示了在可扩展、数据高效的环境监测和决策制定方面的潜力。

Abstract: Understanding environmental ecosystems is vital for the sustainable
management of our planet. However,existing physics-based and data-driven models
often fail to generalize to varying spatial regions and scales due to the
inherent data heterogeneity presented in real environmental ecosystems. This
generalization issue is further exacerbated by the limited observation samples
available for model training. To address these issues, we propose Geo-STARS, a
geo-aware spatio-temporal modeling framework for predicting stream water
temperature across different watersheds and spatial scales. The major
innovation of Geo-STARS is the introduction of geo-aware embedding, which
leverages geographic information to explicitly capture shared principles and
patterns across spatial regions and scales. We further integrate the geo-aware
embedding into a gated spatio-temporal graph neural network. This design
enables the model to learn complex spatial and temporal patterns guided by
geographic and hydrological context, even with sparse or no observational data.
We evaluate Geo-STARS's efficacy in predicting stream water temperature, which
is a master factor for water quality. Using real-world datasets spanning 37
years across multiple watersheds along the eastern coast of the United States,
Geo-STARS demonstrates its superior generalization performance across both
regions and scales, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines. These results
highlight the promise of Geo-STARS for scalable, data-efficient environmental
monitoring and decision-making.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着对可扩展和资源高效模型需求的增加，解决分布式计算、压缩技术和高效训练等神经网络优化挑战变得至关重要。

Method: 开发PETRA框架，应用进化优化于模型架构和训练策略，包括剪枝、量化和损失正则化技术。

Result: 在真实世界金融事件序列、图像和时间序列基准测试中，PETRA显著减小模型大小（最多75%）、降低延迟（最多33%）、提高吞吐量（13%），且目标指标无明显下降。

Conclusion: PETRA框架能有效提升神经网络模型的性能和可扩展性，实现资源高效优化。

Abstract: There are many critical challenges in optimizing neural network models,
including distributed computing, compression techniques, and efficient
training, regardless of their application to specific tasks. Solving such
problems is crucial because the need for scalable and resource-efficient models
is increasing. To address these challenges, we have developed a new automated
machine learning (AutoML) framework, Parameter Efficient Training with Robust
Automation (PETRA). It applies evolutionary optimization to model architecture
and training strategy. PETRA includes pruning, quantization, and loss
regularization. Experimental studies on real-world data with financial event
sequences, as well as image and time-series -- benchmarks, demonstrate PETRA's
ability to improve neural model performance and scalability -- namely, a
significant decrease in model size (up to 75%) and latency (up to 33%), and an
increase in throughput (by 13%) without noticeable degradation in the target
metric.

*Disharee Bhowmick,Ranjith Ramanathan,Sathyanarayanan N. Aakur*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: STaTS是一个轻量级的无监督框架，用于结构感知的时间序列摘要，通过自适应压缩时间序列为紧凑的标记序列，实现高达30倍的序列压缩，同时保留核心时间动态。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有时间序列模型通常处理原始或固定窗口序列，将所有时间步视为同等重要，导致效率低下、鲁棒性差，在长序列或噪声序列中可扩展性有限。

Method: STaTS使用基于BIC的统计差异准则检测多个时间分辨率下的变化点，然后使用均值或GMM等生成模型总结每个片段。

Result: 在150多个数据集上的实验表明，STaTS能够达到完整模型性能的85-90%，同时显著降低计算成本，在噪声下提高鲁棒性并保留判别结构。

Conclusion: STaTS为高效、结构感知的时间序列建模提供了一个原则性的通用解决方案。

Abstract: Time series data often contain latent temporal structure, transitions between
locally stationary regimes, repeated motifs, and bursts of variability, that
are rarely leveraged in standard representation learning pipelines. Existing
models typically operate on raw or fixed-window sequences, treating all time
steps as equally informative, which leads to inefficiencies, poor robustness,
and limited scalability in long or noisy sequences. We propose STaTS, a
lightweight, unsupervised framework for Structure-Aware Temporal Summarization
that adaptively compresses both univariate and multivariate time series into
compact, information-preserving token sequences. STaTS detects change points
across multiple temporal resolutions using a BIC-based statistical divergence
criterion, then summarizes each segment using simple functions like the mean or
generative models such as GMMs. This process achieves up to 30x sequence
compression while retaining core temporal dynamics. STaTS operates as a
model-agnostic preprocessor and can be integrated with existing unsupervised
time series encoders without retraining. Extensive experiments on 150+
datasets, including classification tasks on the UCR-85, UCR-128, and UEA-30
archives, and forecasting on ETTh1 and ETTh2, ETTm1, and Electricity,
demonstrate that STaTS enables 85-90\% of the full-model performance while
offering dramatic reductions in computational cost. Moreover, STaTS improves
robustness under noise and preserves discriminative structure, outperforming
uniform and clustering-based compression baselines. These results position
STaTS as a principled, general-purpose solution for efficient, structure-aware
time series modeling.

TL;DR: 提出了MODE（混合动态专家）框架，通过神经门控机制将复杂动态分解为稀疏可解释组件，能够无监督发现行为模式并在模式转换中进行准确长期预测


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生命科学中的动态系统常包含重叠行为模式的复杂混合，传统基于流的建模技术假设局部平滑动态，难以处理这些模式间的噪声和不规则转换

Method: 采用图形建模框架，通过神经门控机制将复杂动态分解为稀疏可解释组件，允许智能体跳转到不同的控制法则

Result: 在合成和真实计算生物学数据集上验证，能够无监督分类动态快照数据，成功预测细胞生物学中的关键循环和分支过程，在单细胞RNA测序数据中区分增殖与分化动态并预测细胞命运承诺时间

Conclusion: MODE框架特别适用于处理噪声转换，解决了计算生物学中细胞命运预测的关键挑战

Abstract: Dynamical systems in the life sciences are often composed of complex mixtures
of overlapping behavioral regimes. Cellular subpopulations may shift from
cycling to equilibrium dynamics or branch towards different developmental
fates. The transitions between these regimes can appear noisy and irregular,
posing a serious challenge to traditional, flow-based modeling techniques which
assume locally smooth dynamics. To address this challenge, we propose MODE
(Mixture Of Dynamical Experts), a graphical modeling framework whose neural
gating mechanism decomposes complex dynamics into sparse, interpretable
components, enabling both the unsupervised discovery of behavioral regimes and
accurate long-term forecasting across regime transitions. Crucially, because
agents in our framework can jump to different governing laws, MODE is
especially tailored to the aforementioned noisy transitions. We evaluate our
method on a battery of synthetic and real datasets from computational biology.
First, we systematically benchmark MODE on an unsupervised classification task
using synthetic dynamical snapshot data, including in noisy, few-sample
settings. Next, we show how MODE succeeds on challenging forecasting tasks
which simulate key cycling and branching processes in cell biology. Finally, we
deploy our method on human, single-cell RNA sequencing data and show that it
can not only distinguish proliferation from differentiation dynamics but also
predict when cells will commit to their ultimate fate, a key outstanding
challenge in computational biology.

*Sangyun Lee,Brandon Amos,Giulia Fanti*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: BaNEL是一种仅使用失败尝试进行后训练的算法，通过最小化奖励评估次数来改进生成模型在稀疏奖励任务中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前生成模型依赖大量监督数据和信息丰富的奖励函数，但在最困难的问题实例中，基础模型获得接近零的奖励信号，且奖励评估成本高昂，这带来了与标准奖励后训练不同的学习挑战。

Method: 将学习失败规律的问题转化为另一个生成建模问题，利用该模型评估新数据是否与先前失败相似，并引导生成远离这些失败模式。

Result: BaNEL在多个稀疏奖励任务中，无需观察任何成功样本即可提升模型性能，在成功率上比现有新颖性奖励方法高出数个数量级，同时使用更少的奖励评估。

Conclusion: BaNEL算法能够有效处理稀疏奖励环境下的模型后训练问题，仅通过分析失败尝试就能显著提升生成质量。

Abstract: Today's generative models thrive with large amounts of supervised data and
informative reward functions characterizing the quality of the generation. They
work under the assumptions that the supervised data provides knowledge to
pre-train the model, and the reward function provides dense information about
how to further improve the generation quality and correctness. However, in the
hardest instances of important problems, two problems arise: (1) the base
generative model attains a near-zero reward signal, and (2) calls to the reward
oracle are expensive. This setting poses a fundamentally different learning
challenge than standard reward-based post-training. To address this, we propose
BaNEL (Bayesian Negative Evidence Learning), an algorithm that post-trains the
model using failed attempts only, while minimizing the number of reward
evaluations (NREs). Our method is based on the idea that the problem of
learning regularities underlying failures can be cast as another, in-loop
generative modeling problem. We then leverage this model to assess whether new
data resembles previously seen failures and steer the generation away from
them. We show that BaNEL can improve model performance without observing a
single successful sample on several sparse-reward tasks, outperforming existing
novelty-bonus approaches by up to several orders of magnitude in success rate,
while using fewer reward evaluations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在增强推理模式时准确率显著提升，但推理会带来高延迟和令牌使用成本，这对许多简单提示是不必要的

Method: 开发语义路由器，基于查询的推理需求进行分类，仅在有益时选择性应用推理

Result: 相比vLLM直接推理，在MMLU-Pro基准上准确率提升10.2个百分点，延迟降低47.1%，令牌消耗减少48.5%

Conclusion: 语义路由为开源LLM服务系统提供了在准确性和效率之间平衡的有效机制

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate substantial accuracy gains when
augmented with reasoning modes such as chain-of-thought and inference-time
scaling. However, reasoning also incurs significant costs in inference latency
and token usage, with environmental and financial impacts, which are
unnecessary for many simple prompts. We present a semantic router that
classifies queries based on their reasoning requirements and selectively
applies reasoning only when beneficial. Our approach achieves a 10.2 percentage
point improvement in accuracy on the MMLU-Pro benchmark while reducing response
latency by 47.1% and token consumption by 48.5% compared to direct inference
with vLLM. These results demonstrate that semantic routing offers an effective
mechanism for striking a balance between accuracy and efficiency in open-source
LLM serving systems

Conclusion: AIMS在技术和教学创新方面具有潜力，讨论了未来发展方向。

Abstract: Interprofessional education has long relied on case studies and the use of
standardized patients to support teamwork, communication, and related
collaborative competencies among healthcare professionals. However, traditional
approaches are often limited by cost, scalability, and inability to mimic the
dynamic complexity of real-world clinical scenarios. To address these
challenges, we designed and developed AIMS (AI-Enhanced Immersive
Multidisciplinary Simulations), a virtual simulation that integrates a large
language model (Gemini-2.5-Flash), a Unity-based virtual environment engine,
and a character creation pipeline to support synchronized, multimodal
interactions between the user and the virtual patient. AIMS was designed to
enhance collaborative clinical reasoning and health promotion competencies
among students from pharmacy, medicine, nursing, and social work. A formal
usability testing session was conducted which participants assumed professional
roles on a healthcare team and engaged in a mix of scripted and unscripted
conversations. Participants explored the patient's symptoms, social context,
and care needs. Usability issues were identified (e.g., audio routing, response
latency) and used to guide subsequent refinements. Findings in general suggest
that AIMS supports realistic, profession-specific and contextually appropriate
conversations. We discussed both technical and pedagogical innovations of AIMS
and concluded with future directions.

TL;DR: Maple是一个多智能体系统，通过自然语言输入生成正确的深度学习命令行，解决了在异构GPU集群上训练深度学习模型时的命令行配置难题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在GPU集群上训练深度学习模型时，用户需要适应异构启动器、调度器、亲和性选项、DL框架参数和环境变量，手动组合命令行容易出错且令人沮丧，阻碍研究或浪费资源。

Method: Maple由四个智能体组成，功能包括信息提取、模板检索、命令行验证和错误纠正。系统利用多个总参数量为10B的语言模型。

Result: 在9个美国国家计算中心的GPU集群、5个代表性深度学习模型家族和4种常用并行DL训练范式的567个测试案例中，Maple实现了92.0%的命令行生成准确率，性能与GPT-5、Claude和Gemini等最先进模型相当。

Conclusion: Maple在实际应用中具有重要价值，能够在异构高性能计算环境中实现可移植和可扩展的分布式深度学习。

Abstract: Training deep learning (DL) models across Graphics Processing Unit (GPU)
clusters is technically challenging. One aspect is that users have to compose
command lines to adapt to the heterogeneous launchers, schedulers, affinity
options, DL framework arguments, and environment variables. Composing correct
command lines is error-prone and can easily frustrate users, impeding research
or wasting resources. In this work, we present Maple, a multi-agent system that
generates correct DL command lines with users' natural language input. Maple
consists of four agents with the functionalities of information extraction,
template retrieval, command line verification, and error correction. We
evaluate Maple on nine GPU clusters across national computing centers in the
U.S., five representative deep learning model families, and four commonly used
parallel DL training paradigms. Our experiments also cover schedulers of SLURM
and PBS and heterogeneous architectures, such as NVIDIA A100/H200 GPUs and
Intel Max series GPUs. Maple achieves 92.0% accuracy in generating command
lines across the 567 test cases. Leverage multiple language models with an
aggregated size of 10B parameters, Maple delivers comparable performance to the
state-of-the-art models of GPT-5, Claude, and Gemini. Together, these results
highlight Maple's practical value in enabling portable and scalable distributed
DL across heterogeneous HPC environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有分布式矩阵乘法算法仅支持部分分区方式，需要多个算法实现来支持全部分区组合，否则需要数据重分布增加通信成本

Method: 使用切片（索引算术）计算需要相乘的重叠瓦片集合，然后直接执行或重新排序并降低到优化IR以最大化重叠，基于C++ PGAS框架实现直接GPU到GPU通信

Result: 在各种分区和复制因子下评估性能，发现与针对AI模型的高度优化分布式张量库PyTorch DTensor具有竞争力

Conclusion: 该通用算法解决了现有方法的分区限制问题，通过统一的实现支持所有分区组合，避免了数据重分布的开销

Abstract: Many important applications across science, data analytics, and AI workloads
depend on distributed matrix multiplication. Prior work has developed a large
array of algorithms suitable for different problem sizes and partitionings
including 1D, 2D, 1.5D, and 2.5D algorithms. A limitation of current work is
that existing algorithms are limited to a subset of partitionings. Multiple
algorithm implementations are required to support the full space of possible
partitionings. If no algorithm implementation is available for a particular set
of partitionings, one or more operands must be redistributed, increasing
communication costs. This paper presents a universal one-sided algorithm for
distributed matrix multiplication that supports all combinations of
partitionings and replication factors. Our algorithm uses slicing (index
arithmetic) to compute the sets of overlapping tiles that must be multiplied
together. This list of local matrix multiplies can then either be executed
directly, or reordered and lowered to an optimized IR to maximize overlap. We
implement our algorithm using a high-level C++-based PGAS programming framework
that performs direct GPU-to-GPU communication using intra-node interconnects.
We evaluate performance for a wide variety of partitionings and replication
factors, finding that our work is competitive with PyTorch DTensor, a highly
optimized distributed tensor library targeting AI models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统MPC方法在PE上执行控制器会因操作系统开销产生抖动并限制控制带宽，而专用片上控制器虽然能实现快速确定性控制，但存在面积和功耗开销问题。

Method: 基于算子分裂二次规划求解器和嵌入式多核RISC-V控制器，通过剪枝弱热耦合减少模型内存，以及预先调度优化稀疏三角系统的并行执行。

Result: 在500MHz频率下控制144个PE时实现亚毫秒延迟，比单核基线延迟降低33倍，能效提高7.9倍，内存占用小于1MiB，功耗仅325mW，占用芯片面积小于1.5%。

Conclusion: 该硬件-软件协同设计方法成功解决了多核HPC处理器能量热管理的控制挑战，实现了高效、低延迟、低功耗的片上MPC控制。

Abstract: Managing energy and thermal profiles is critical for many-core HPC processors
with hundreds of application-class processing elements (PEs). Advanced model
predictive control (MPC) delivers state-of-the-art performance but requires
solving an online optimization problem over a thousand times per second (1 kHz
control bandwidth), with computational and memory demands scaling with PE
count. Traditional MPC approaches execute the controller on the PEs, but
operating system overheads create jitter and limit control bandwidth. Running
MPC on dedicated on-chip controllers enables fast, deterministic control but
raises concerns about area and power overhead. In this work, we tackle these
challenges by proposing a hardware-software codesign of a lightweight MPC
controller, based on an operator-splitting quadratic programming solver and an
embedded multi-core RISC-V controller. Key innovations include pruning weak
thermal couplings to reduce model memory and ahead-of-time scheduling for
efficient parallel execution of sparse triangular systems arising from the
optimization problem. The proposed controller achieves sub-millisecond latency
when controlling 144 PEs at 500 MHz, delivering 33x lower latency and 7.9x
higher energy efficiency than a single-core baseline. Operating within a
compact less than 1 MiB memory footprint, it consumes as little as 325 mW while
occupying less than 1.5% of a typical HPC processor's die area.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统AI加速器假设存在内存需求、批处理效果和延迟-吞吐量权衡的系统级泛化问题，忽略了神经网络算子的异构计算模式。芯片级定制虽然能解决这些问题，但会产生高昂的非重复性工程成本。

Method: 采用算子级解构方法探索芯片和内存异构性、张量融合和张量并行，通过布局布线验证确保物理可实现性，支持约束感知的系统级优化。

Result: 仅使用8个战略选择的芯片，Mozart生成的复合BASIC相比传统同构加速器在能量、能量-成本乘积、能量-延迟乘积和能量-延迟-成本乘积方面分别减少43.5%、25.4%、67.7%和78.8%。在数据中心LLM服务、推测解码和自动驾驶感知等场景中均取得显著性能提升。

Conclusion: Mozart框架通过系统化的芯片生态系统设计，有效解决了AI加速中的异构计算挑战，在降低NRE成本的同时实现了显著的能效和性能改进。

Abstract: Modern AI acceleration faces a fundamental challenge: conventional
assumptions about memory requirements, batching effectiveness, and
latency-throughput tradeoffs are systemwide generalizations that ignore the
heterogeneous computational patterns of individual neural network operators.
However, going towards network-level customization and operator-level
heterogeneity incur substantial Non-Recurring Engineering (NRE) costs. While
chiplet-based approaches have been proposed to amortize NRE costs, reuse
opportunities remain limited without carefully identifying which chiplets are
truly necessary. This paper introduces Mozart, a chiplet ecosystem and
accelerator codesign framework that systematically constructs low cost bespoke
application-specific integrated circuits (BASICs). BASICs leverage
operator-level disaggregation to explore chiplet and memory heterogeneity,
tensor fusion, and tensor parallelism, with place-and-route validation ensuring
physical implementability. The framework also enables constraint-aware
system-level optimization across deployment contexts ranging from datacenter
inference serving to edge computing in autonomous vehicles. The evaluation
confirms that with just 8 strategically selected chiplets, Mozart-generated
composite BASICs achieve 43.5%, 25.4%, 67.7%, and 78.8% reductions in energy,
energy-cost product, energy-delay product (EDP), and energy-delay-cost product
compared to traditional homogeneous accelerators. For datacenter LLM serving,
Mozart achieves 15-19% energy reduction and 35-39% energy-cost improvement. In
speculative decoding, Mozart delivers throughput improvements of 24.6-58.6%
while reducing energy consumption by 38.6-45.6%. For autonomous vehicle
perception, Mozart reduces energy-cost by 25.54% and energy by 10.53% under
real-time constraints.

Abstract: Hand-sized Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) sequencing machines are of growing
importance in several life sciences fields as their small footprints enable a
broader range of use cases than their larger, stationary counterparts. However,
as currently designed, they lack sufficient embedded computing to process the
large volume of measurements generated by their internal sensory system. As a
consequence, they rely on external devices for additional processing
capability. This dependence on external processing places a significant
communication burden on the sequencer's embedded electronics. Moreover, it also
prevents a truly mobile solution for sequencing in real-time. Anticipating
next-generation machines that include suitably advanced processing, we present
a System-on-Chip (SoC) fabricated in 22-nm complementary metal-oxide
semiconductor (CMOS). Our design, based on a general-purpose reduced
instruction set computing (RISC-V) core, also includes accelerators for DNA
detection that allow our system to demonstrate a 13X performance improvement
over commercial embedded multicore processors combined with a near 3000X boost

Conclusion: HERO能够有效导航硬件与算法需求之间的复杂设计空间，为NeRF实现发现更优的量化策略。

Abstract: Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) has emerged as a promising 3D reconstruction
method, delivering high-quality results for AR/VR applications. While
quantization methods and hardware accelerators have been proposed to enhance
NeRF's computational efficiency, existing approaches face crucial limitations.
Current quantization methods operate without considering hardware architecture,
resulting in sub-optimal solutions within the vast design space encompassing
accuracy, latency, and model size. Additionally, existing NeRF accelerators
heavily rely on human experts to explore this design space, making the
optimization process time-consuming, inefficient, and unlikely to discover
optimal solutions. To address these challenges, we introduce HERO, a
reinforcement learning framework performing hardware-aware quantization for
NeRF. Our framework integrates a NeRF accelerator simulator to generate
real-time hardware feedback, enabling fully automated adaptation to hardware
constraints. Experimental results demonstrate that HERO achieves 1.31-1.33
$\times$ better latency, 1.29-1.33 $\times$ improved cost efficiency, and a
more compact model size compared to CAQ, a previous state-of-the-art NeRF
quantization framework. These results validate our framework's capability to
effectively navigate the complex design space between hardware and algorithm
requirements, discovering superior quantization policies for NeRF
implementation. Code is available at https://github.com/ypzhng/HERO.

In this paper, we present a CMOS system-on-chip (SoC) designed for mobile
genetic analysis. Our approach combines a multi-core RISC-V processor with
tightly coupled accelerators for deep learning and bioinformatics. A
hardware/software co-design strategy enables energy-efficient operation across
a heterogeneous compute fabric, targeting real-time, on-device genome analysis.
This work exemplifies the integration of deep learning, edge computing, and
domain-specific hardware to advance next-generation mobile genomics.
