While LIs achieve remarkable\nefficiency for static datasets, their performance degrades under dynamic\nupdates: maintaining the CDF invariant (sum of F(k) equals 1) requires global\nmodel retraining, which blocks queries and limits the queries-per-second (QPS)\nmetric. Current approaches fail to address these retraining costs effectively,\nrendering them unsuitable for real-world workloads with frequent updates. In\nthis paper, we present Sig2Model, an efficient and adaptive learned index that\nminimizes retraining cost through three key techniques: (1) a sigmoid boosting\napproximation technique that dynamically adjusts the index model by\napproximating update-induced shifts in data distribution with localized sigmoid\nfunctions while preserving bounded error guarantees and deferring full\nretraining; (2) proactive update training via Gaussian mixture models (GMMs)\nthat identifies high-update-probability regions for strategic placeholder\nallocation to speed up updates; and (3) a neural joint optimization framework\nthat continuously refines both the sigmoid ensemble and GMM parameters via\ngradient-based learning. We evaluate Sig2Model against state-of-the-art\nupdatable learned indexes on real-world and synthetic workloads, and show that\nSig2Model reduces retraining cost by up to 20x, achieves up to 3x higher QPS,\nand uses up to 1000x less memory."}

PIRF mitigates these issues through two key strategies: (1) a\nlayer-wise truncated backpropagation method that leverages the spatiotemporally\nlocalized nature of physics-based rewards, and (2) a weight-based\nregularization scheme that improves efficiency over traditional\ndistillation-based methods. Across five PDE benchmarks, PIRF consistently\nachieves superior physical enforcement under efficient sampling regimes,\nhighlighting the potential of reward fine-tuning for advancing scientific\ngenerative modeling."}

While machine learning models have\nshown promise in this domain, their success is often limited by the amount and\ndiversity of training data available to individual hospitals and Intensive Care\nUnits (ICUs). Federated Learning (FL) addresses this issue by enabling\ncollaborative model training across institutions without requiring data\nsharing, thus preserving patient privacy. In this work, we propose a federated,\nattention-enhanced Long Short-Term Memory model for sepsis onset prediction,\ntrained on multi-centric ICU data. Unlike existing approaches that rely on\nfixed prediction windows, our model supports variable prediction horizons,\nenabling both short- and long-term forecasting in a single unified model.\nDuring analysis, we put particular emphasis on the improvements through our\napproach in terms of early sepsis detection, i.e., predictions with large\nprediction windows by conducting an in-depth temporal analysis.

In this\npaper, we investigate the mechanism through a novel perspective of information\nremoval. Specifically, we demonstrate that in the zero-shot scenario, LMs\nencode queries into non-selective representations in hidden states containing\ninformation for all possible tasks, leading to arbitrary outputs without\nfocusing on the intended task, resulting in near-zero accuracy. Meanwhile, we\nfind that selectively removing specific information from hidden states by a\nlow-rank filter effectively steers LMs toward the intended task. Building on\nthese findings, by measuring the hidden states on carefully designed metrics,\nwe observe that few-shot ICL effectively simulates such task-oriented\ninformation removal processes, selectively removing the redundant information\nfrom entangled non-selective representations, and improving the output based on\nthe demonstrations, which constitutes a key mechanism underlying ICL. Moreover,\nwe identify essential attention heads inducing the removal operation, termed\nDenoising Heads, which enables the ablation experiments blocking the\ninformation removal operation from the inference, where the ICL accuracy\nsignificantly degrades, especially when the correct label is absent from the\nfew-shot demonstrations, confirming both the critical role of the information\nremoval mechanism and denoising heads."}

Compared to clipped GRPO, GR-PSPO\nsubstantially improves performance both the 0.5B and 1.5B models, with a boost\nof over 20% on GSM8K (39.7% vs. 17.6% for 0.5B, 59.4% vs. 37.8% for 1.5B)."}

However, in practice, models often\nget updated to reflect changes in the data distribution or environment,\ninvalidating the recourse recommendations (i.e., following the recourse will\nnot lead to the desirable outcome). The robust recourse literature addresses\nthis issue by providing a framework for computing recourses whose validity is\nresilient to slight changes in the model. However, since the optimization\nproblem of computing robust recourse is non-convex (even for linear models),\nmost of the current approaches do not have any theoretical guarantee on the\noptimality of the recourse. Recent work by Kayastha et. al. provides the first\nprovably optimal algorithm for robust recourse with respect to generalized\nlinear models when the model changes are measured using the $L^{\\infty}$ norm.\nHowever, using the $L^{\\infty}$ norm can lead to recourse solutions with a high\nprice. To address this shortcoming, we consider more constrained model changes\ndefined by the $L^p$ norm, where $p\\geq 1$ but $p\\neq \\infty$, and provide a\nnew algorithm that provably computes the optimal robust recourse for\ngeneralized linear models. Empirically, for both linear and non-linear models,\nwe demonstrate that our algorithm achieves a significantly lower price of\nrecourse (up to several orders of magnitude) compared to prior work and also\nexhibits a better trade-off between the implementation cost of recourse and its\nvalidity. Our empirical analysis also illustrates that our approach provides\nmore sparse recourses compared to prior work and remains resilient to\npost-processing approaches that guarantee feasibility."}

Recent work has shown that, under certain conditions,\nportions of the training set can be reconstructed directly from model\nparameters. Some of these methods exploit implicit bias toward margin\nmaximization, suggesting that properties often regarded as beneficial for\ngeneralization may actually compromise privacy. Yet despite striking empirical\ndemonstrations, the reliability of these attacks remains poorly understood and\nlacks a solid theoretical foundation. In this work, we take a complementary\nperspective: rather than designing stronger attacks, we analyze the inherent\nweaknesses and limitations of existing reconstruction methods and identify\nconditions under which they fail. We rigorously prove that, without\nincorporating prior knowledge about the data, there exist infinitely many\nalternative solutions that may lie arbitrarily far from the true training set,\nrendering reconstruction fundamentally unreliable. Empirically, we further\ndemonstrate that exact duplication of training examples occurs only by chance.\nOur results refine the theoretical understanding of when training set leakage\nis possible and offer new insights into mitigating reconstruction attacks.\nRemarkably, we demonstrate that networks trained more extensively, and\ntherefore satisfying implicit bias conditions more strongly -- are, in fact,\nless susceptible to reconstruction attacks, reconciling privacy with the need\nfor strong generalization in this setting."}

However,\nsynchronous RL post-training often suffers from significant GPU\nunderutilization, referred to as bubbles, caused by imbalanced response lengths\nwithin rollout steps. Many RL systems attempt to alleviate this problem by\nrelaxing synchronization, but this can compromise training accuracy. In this\npaper, we introduce tail batching, a novel rollout scheduling strategy for\nsynchronous RL that systematically consolidates prompts leading to long-tail\nresponses into a small subset of rollout steps (long rounds), while ensuring\nthat the majority of steps (short rounds) involve only balanced, short\nrollouts. By excluding long responses from short rounds and rescheduling them\ninto a few designated long rounds, tail batching effectively reduces GPU idle\ntime during rollouts and significantly accelerates RL training without\nsacrificing accuracy. We present RollPacker, a system that fully harnesses the\nbenefits of tail batching through holistic optimizations across all three RL\nstages: elastic parallelism adaptation for rollout, dynamic resource allocation\nand scheduling for reward, and stream-based training. Empirical results show\nthat RollPacker achieves a 2.03x-2.56x end-to-end training time reduction\ncompared to veRL and up to 2.24x speedup compared to RLHFuse for the Qwen2.5\nfamily of LLMs on up to 128 H800 GPUs."}
