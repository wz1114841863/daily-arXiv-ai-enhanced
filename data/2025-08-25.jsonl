Many attempts employ supervised or\nreinforcement learning to support the decision-making of heuristic methods.\nHowever, in some cases, these techniques are deemed too time-consuming and not\ncompetitive with hand-crafted heuristics. This paper proposes a hybridization\nbetween metaheuristics and a less expensive learning strategy to extract the\nlatent structure of graphs, known as Graph Representation Learning (GRL). For\nsuch, we approach the Constrained Incremental Graph Drawing Problem (C-IGDP), a\nhierarchical graph visualization problem. There is limited literature on\nmethods for this problem, for which Greedy Randomized Search Procedures (GRASP)\nheuristics have shown promising results. In line with this, this paper\ninvestigates the gains of incorporating GRL into the construction phase of\nGRASP, which we refer to as Graph Learning GRASP (GL-GRASP). In computational\nexperiments, we first analyze the results achieved considering different node\nembedding techniques, where deep learning-based strategies stood out. The\nevaluation considered the primal integral measure that assesses the quality of\nthe solutions according to the required time for such. According to this\nmeasure, the best GL-GRASP heuristics demonstrated superior performance than\nstate-of-the-art literature GRASP heuristics for the problem. A scalability\ntest on newly generated denser instances under a fixed time limit further\nconfirmed the robustness of the GL-GRASP heuristics."}

In domains where new data can be simulated cheaply,\nthese systems uncover sequential decision-making policies that far exceed the\nability of any human. Society faces many problems whose solutions require this\nskill, but they are often in domains where new data cannot be cheaply\nsimulated. In such scenarios, we can learn simulators from existing data, but\nthese will only ever be approximately correct, and can be pathologically\nincorrect when queried outside of their training distribution. As a result, a\nmisalignment between the environments in which we train our agents and the\nreal-world in which we wish to deploy our agents is inevitable. Dealing with\nthis misalignment is the primary concern of zero-shot reinforcement learning, a\nproblem setting where the agent must generalise to a new task or domain with\nzero practice shots. Whilst impressive progress has been made on methods that\nperform zero-shot RL in idealised settings, new work is needed if these results\nare to be replicated in real-world settings. In this thesis, we argue that\ndoing so requires us to navigate (at least) three constraints. First, the data\nquality constraint: real-world datasets are small and homogeneous. Second, the\nobservability constraint: states, dynamics and rewards in the real-world are\noften only partially observed. And third, the data availability constraint: a\npriori access to data cannot always be assumed. This work proposes a suite of\nmethods that perform zero-shot RL subject to these constraints. In a series of\nempirical studies we expose the failings of existing methods, and justify our\ntechniques for remedying them.
