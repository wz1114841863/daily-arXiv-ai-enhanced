In this work, we propose a\nQuantum-inspired Neural Network with Quantum Jump (QiNN-QJ) for multimodal\nentanglement modelling. Each modality is firstly encoded as a quantum pure\nstate, after which a differentiable module simulating the QJ operator\ntransforms the separable product state into the entangled representation.

The resulting\nentangled states are projected onto trainable measurement vectors to produce\npredictions. In addition to achieving superior performance over the\nstate-of-the-art models on benchmark datasets, including CMU-MOSI, CMU-MOSEI,\nand CH-SIMS, QiNN-QJ facilitates enhanced post-hoc interpretability through\nvon-Neumann entanglement entropy.

In \"agentic misalignment\" scenarios, we resample specific sentences\nto measure their downstream effects. Self-preservation sentences have small\ncausal impact, suggesting they do not meaningfully drive blackmail. Second, are\nartificial edits to CoT sufficient for steering reasoning?

Third, how do we understand the effect of\nremoving a reasoning step when the model may repeat it post-edit? We introduce\na resilience metric that repeatedly resamples to prevent similar content from\nreappearing downstream.

Existing\nlearning-based methods often utilize Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to improve\nthe performance and speed up the construction. However, their reliance on\nincomplete factorization leads to significant challenges: the associated\ntriangular solve hinders GPU parallelization in practice, and introduces\nlong-range dependencies which are difficult for GNNs to model. To address these\nissues, we propose a learning-based method to generate GPU-friendly\npreconditioners, particularly using GNNs to construct Sparse Approximate\nInverse (SPAI) preconditioners, which avoids triangular solves and requires\nonly two matrix-vector products at each CG step. The locality of matrix-vector\nproduct is compatible with the local propagation mechanism of GNNs. The\nflexibility of GNNs also allows our approach to be applied in a wide range of\nscenarios. Furthermore, we introduce a statistics-based scale-invariant loss\nfunction. Its design matches CG's property that the convergence rate depends on\nthe condition number, rather than the absolute scale of A, leading to improved\nperformance of the learned preconditioner. Evaluations on three PDE-derived\ndatasets and one synthetic dataset demonstrate that our method outperforms\nstandard preconditioners (Diagonal, IC, and traditional SPAI) and previous\nlearning-based preconditioners on GPUs. We reduce solution time on GPUs by\n40%-53% (68%-113% faster), along with better condition numbers and superior\ngeneralization performance.

In this work, we\ninvestigate the applicability a recently proposed time series classification\nfoundation model, to a different EEG tasks such as motor imagery classification\nand sleep stage prediction. We test two pretraining regimes: (a) pretraining on\nheterogeneous real-world time series from multiple domains, and (b) pretraining\non purely synthetic data. We find that both variants yield strong performance,\nconsistently outperforming EEGNet, a widely used convolutional baseline, and\nCBraMod, the most recent EEG-specific foundation model. These results suggest\nthat generalist time series foundation models, even when pretrained on data of\nnon-neural origin or on synthetic signals, can transfer effectively to EEG.

However, data from different structures will follow\ndistinct distributions, potentially leading to large generalisation errors for\nmodels learnt via conventional machine learning methods. To address this issue,\ntransfer learning -- in the form of domain adaptation (DA) -- can be used to\nalign the data distributions. Most previous approaches have only considered\n\\emph{unsupervised} DA, where no labelled target data are available; they do\nnot consider how to incorporate these technologies in an online framework --\nupdating as labels are obtained throughout the monitoring campaign. This paper\nproposes a Bayesian framework for DA in PBSHM, that can improve unsupervised DA\nmappings using a limited quantity of labelled target data. In addition, this\nmodel is integrated into an active sampling strategy to guide inspections to\nselect the most informative observations to label -- leading to further\nreductions in the required labelled data to learn a target classifier. The\neffectiveness of this methodology is evaluated on a population of experimental\nbridges. Specifically, this population includes data corresponding to several\ndamage states, as well as, a comprehensive set of environmental conditions. It\nis found that combining transfer learning and active learning can improve data\nefficiency when learning classification models in label-scarce scenarios. This\nresult has implications for data-informed operation and maintenance of\nstructures, suggesting a reduction in inspections over the operational lifetime\nof a structure -- and therefore a reduction in operational costs -- can be\nachieved."}

To address these issues, we propose ORGEval, a\ngraph-theoretic evaluation framework for assessing LLMs' capabilities in\nformulating linear and mixed-integer linear programs. ORGEval represents\noptimization models as graphs, reducing equivalence detection to graph\nisomorphism testing. We identify and prove a sufficient condition, when the\ntested graphs are symmetric decomposable (SD), under which the\nWeisfeiler-Lehman (WL) test is guaranteed to correctly detect isomorphism.\nBuilding on this, ORGEval integrates a tailored variant of the WL-test with an\nSD detection algorithm to evaluate model equivalence. By focusing on structural\nequivalence rather than instance-level configurations, ORGEval is robust to\nnumerical variations. Experimental results show that our method can\nsuccessfully detect model equivalence and produce 100\\% consistent results\nacross random parameter configurations, while significantly outperforming\nsolver-based methods in runtime, especially on difficult problems.

However, an emerging\nparadigm instead views model training as extracting enough information from\ndata so that the model can be used to minimize many losses on many downstream\ntasks. We formalize a mathematical framework for this paradigm, which we call\npanprediction, and study its statistical complexity. Formally, panprediction\ngeneralizes omniprediction and sits upstream from multi-group learning, which\nrespectively focus on predictions that generalize to many downstream losses or\nmany downstream tasks, but not both. Concretely, we design algorithms that\nlearn deterministic and randomized panpredictors with\n$\\tilde{O}(1/\\varepsilon^3)$ and $\\tilde{O}(1/\\varepsilon^2)$ samples,\nrespectively.

By avoiding the computation of\nintermediate gradients and the storage of intermediate outputs, it reduces\nmemory usage and helps mitigate issues such as vanishing or exploding\ngradients.

In\nthis paper, we first systematically analyze the training dynamics of popular\nconvolutional neural networks (CNNs) trained by stochastic gradient descent\n(SGD) through an information-theoretic lens.

Openness in MARL refers\nto the dynam-ic nature of agent populations, tasks, and agent types with-in a\nsystem. Specifically, there are three types of openness as reported in (Eck et\nal. 2023) [2]: agent openness, where agents can enter or leave the system at\nany time; task openness, where new tasks emerge, and existing ones evolve or\ndisappear; and type openness, where the capabil-ities and behaviors of agents\nchange over time. This report provides a conceptual and empirical review,\nfocusing on the interplay between openness and the credit assignment problem\n(CAP). CAP involves determining the contribution of individual agents to the\noverall system performance, a task that becomes increasingly complex in open\nenviron-ments. Traditional credit assignment (CA) methods often assume static\nagent populations, fixed and pre-defined tasks, and stationary types, making\nthem inadequate for open systems. We first conduct a conceptual analysis,\nin-troducing new sub-categories of openness to detail how events like agent\nturnover or task cancellation break the assumptions of environmental\nstationarity and fixed team composition that underpin existing CAP methods. We\nthen present an empirical study using representative temporal and structural\nalgorithms in an open environment. The results demonstrate that openness\ndirectly causes credit misattribution, evidenced by unstable loss functions and\nsignificant performance degradation."}
