We organize AoI and its variants into native, function-based, and application-oriented families, providing a clearer view of how freshness should be modeled in B5G and 6G systems. Building on this foundation, we introduce a policy-centric taxonomy that reflects the decisions most relevant to freshness, consisting of update-control RL, medium-access RL, risk-sensitive RL, and multi-agent RL. This structure provides a coherent framework for understanding how learning can support sampling, scheduling, trajectory planning, medium access, and distributed coordination.

However, due to the huge size of embedding tables, typical DLRM training frameworks adopt one or more parameter servers to maintain global embedding tables, while leveraging the edge workers cache part of them. This incurs significant transmission cost for embedding transmissions between workers and parameter servers, which can dominate the training cycle. In this paper, we investigate how to dispatch input embedding samples to appropriate edge workers to minimize the total embedding transmission cost when facing edge-specific challenges such as heterogeneous networks and limited resources. We develop ESD, a novel mechanism that optimizes the dispatch of input embedding samples to edge workers based on expected embedding transmission cost. We propose HybridDis as the dispatch decision method within ESD, which combines a resource-intensive optimal algorithm and a heuristic algorithm to balance decision quality and resource consumption. We implement a prototype of ESD and compare it with state-of-the-art mechanisms on real-world workloads. Extensive experimental results show that ESD reduces the embedding transmission cost by up to 36.76% and achieves up to 1.74 times speedup in end-to-end DLRM training."}

The framework extends classical Noether-type analyses in three directions: from gradient constraints to Hessian constraints, from symmetry to general equivariance, and from continuous to discrete transformations. At the first order, our framework unifies conservation laws and implicit-bias relations as special cases of a single identity. At the second order, it provides structural predictions about curvature: which directions are flat or sharp, how the gradient aligns with Hessian eigenspaces, and how the loss landscape geometry reflects the underlying transformation structure.

Recently, a distributed system called PETALS was developed to lower the barrier for deploying LLMs by splitting the model blocks across multiple servers with low-end GPUs distributed over the Internet, which was much faster than swapping the model parameters between the GPU memory and other cheaper but slower local storage media. However, the performance of such a distributed system critically depends on the resource allocation, and how to do so optimally remains unknown. In this work, we present the first systematic study of the resource allocation problem in distributed LLM inference, with focus on two important decisions: block placement and request routing. Our main results include: experimentally validated performance models that can predict the inference performance under given block placement and request routing decisions, a formulation of the offline optimization of block placement and request routing as a mixed integer linear programming problem together with the NP-hardness proof and a polynomial-complexity algorithm with guaranteed performance, and an adaptation of the offline algorithm for the online setting with the same performance guarantee under bounded load. Through both experiments and experimentally-validated simulations, we have verified that the proposed solution can substantially reduce the inference time compared to the state-of-the-art solution in diverse settings with geographically-distributed servers. As a byproduct, we have also developed a light-weighted CPU-only simulator capable of predicting the performance of distributed LLM inference on GPU servers, which can evaluate large deployments and facilitate future research for researchers with limited GPU access."}

While modern GPUs provide specialised Matrix-Multiply-Accumulate (MMA) units, e.g., Tensor Cores (TC), with extremely high throughput, they target dense operations, making it non-trivial to exploit them for irregular, unstructured graph computations. In particular, fully utilising them for a BFS requires an efficient mapping of the edge operations onto TCs while avoiding redundancy, load imbalance, and synchronisation. We present BLEST, a TC-accelerated framework that reformulates the pull-based BFS pipeline around a bitmap-oriented structure and a carefully engineered execution layout. BLEST introduces Binarised Virtual Slice Sets (BVSS) to enforce warp-level load balancing and to eliminate frontier-oblivious work assignment. To improve both memory efficiency and update locality across diverse graphs, we apply two complementary graph reordering strategies: a compression-oriented ordering for social-like graphs and a bandwidth-reducing ordering for non-social graphs. At the compute level, we develop a batched SpMSpV multiplication pattern that uses the bitwise TC tiles to handle dot products without wasting output entries, thereby reducing the number of required MMA calls. Finally, BLEST combines kernel fusion with a lazy vertex update scheme to reduce host-side synchronisation, mitigate atomic overheads, and improve cache locality. Experiments show that BLEST delivers, on average, $3.58\\times$, $4.64\\times$ and $4.9\\times$ speedup over BerryBees, Gunrock, and GSWITCH, respectively, across a broad set of real-world graphs."}

Estimating excess mortality, defined as deaths beyond expected levels based on pre-pandemic patterns, is essential for understanding pandemic impacts and informing intervention strategies. However, traditional statistical methods like SARIMA assume linearity, stationarity, and fixed seasonality, which may not hold under structural disruptions. We present a systematic comparison of SARIMA against three deep learning (DL) architectures (LSTM, Seq2Seq, and Transformer) for counterfactual mortality estimation using national CDC data (2015-2019 for training/validation, 2020-2023 for projection). We contribute empirical evidence that LSTM achieves superior point estimation (17.08% MAPE vs. 23.88% for SARIMA) and better-calibrated uncertainty (68.8% vs. 47.9% prediction interval coverage) when projecting under regime change. We also demonstrate that attention-based models (Seq2Seq, Transformer) underperform due to overfitting to historical means rather than capturing emergent trends. Ourreproducible pipeline incorporates conformal prediction intervals and convergence analysis across 60+ trials per configuration, and we provide an open-source framework deployable with 15 state health departments. Our findings establish that carefully validated DL models can provide more reliable counterfactual estimates than traditional methods for public health planning, while highlighting the need for calibration techniques when deploying neural forecasting in high-stakes domains."}

Despite these advantages, FFT performance is often degraded by unreliable server-client connections and heterogeneous client data distributions. Most existing methods assume homogeneous network conditions or require prior knowledge of connection failures. However, these assumptions are impractical in real-world networks characterized by diverse communication standards (e.g., wired, Wi-Fi, 4G, and 5G) and heterogeneous failure patterns. To address these limitations, we propose FedAuto, a novel FFT framework that mitigates the combined effects of connection failures and data heterogeneity via adaptive aggregation. FedAuto operates without prior knowledge of network conditions or modifications to existing infrastructure, enabling seamless plug-and-play deployment. Moreover, we establish a rigorous convergence guarantee for FedAuto. By adopting a novel per-round aggregation perspective, our analysis removes the need for assumptions on connection failures probabilities or client selection strategies commonly imposed in prior work, and guarantees convergence of FedAuto for each individual realization, providing a stronger theoretical assurance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FedAuto consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines under diverse connection failure scenarios for both full-parameter and partial-parameter fine-tuning (e.g., LoRA), and even surpasses strategies that rely on complex communication resource optimization."}

MotionTeller combines a pretrained actigraphy encoder with a lightweight projection module that maps behavioral embeddings into the token space of a frozen decoder-only LLM, enabling free-text, autoregressive generation of daily behavioral summaries. We construct a novel dataset of 54383 (actigraphy, text) pairs derived from real-world NHANES recordings, and train the model using cross-entropy loss with supervision only on the language tokens.

Although existing IMVC methods have made progress from both imputation-based and imputation-free routes, they have overlooked the pair under-utilization issue, i.e., inconsistent missing patterns make the incomplete but available multi-view pairs unable to be fully utilized, thereby limiting the model performance. To address this, we propose a novel missing-pattern tree based IMVC framework entitled TreeEIC. Specifically, to achieve full exploitation of available multi-view pairs, TreeEIC first defines the missing-pattern tree model to group data into multiple decision sets according to different missing patterns, and then performs multi-view clustering within each set. Furthermore, a multi-view decision ensemble module is proposed to aggregate clustering results from all decision sets, which infers uncertainty-based weights to suppress unreliable clustering decisions and produce robust decisions. Finally, an ensemble-to-individual knowledge distillation module transfers the ensemble knowledge to view-specific clustering models, which enables ensemble and individual modules to promote each other by optimizing cross-view consistency and inter-cluster discrimination losses. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that our TreeEIC achieves state-of-the-art IMVC performance and exhibits superior robustness under highly inconsistent missing patterns."}

Such a design enhances the robustness when predicting across simulation timesteps, especially when the training and test data exhibit significant variation. We validate the effectiveness of DeepCQ on four real-world scientific applications. Our results highlight the framework's exceptional predictive accuracy, with prediction errors generally under 10\\% across most settings, significantly outperforming existing methods.

To address this challenge, we propose a novel perplexity-aware data scaling law to establish a predictive relationship between the perplexity landscape of domain-specific data and the test loss. Our approach leverages the perplexity derived from the pre-trained model on domain data as a proxy for estimating the knowledge gap, effectively quantifying the informational perplexity landscape of candidate training samples. By fitting this scaling law across diverse perplexity regimes, we enable adaptive selection of high-utility data subsets, prioritizing content that maximizes knowledge absorption while minimizing redundancy and noise. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method consistently identifies near-optimal training subsets and achieves superior performance on both medical and general-domain benchmarks."}

Nevertheless, real-world multi-view data suffer from data incompleteness or noise, resulting in rare-paired samples or mis-paired samples which significantly challenges the effectiveness of CL-based MVC. That is, rare-paired issue prevents MVC from extracting sufficient multi-view complementary information, and mis-paired issue causes contrastive learning to optimize the model in the wrong direction. To address these issues, we propose a unified CL-based MVC framework for enhancing clustering effectiveness on incomplete and noise multi-view data. First, to overcome the rare-paired issue, we design a global-graph guided contrastive learning, where all view samples construct a global-view affinity graph to form new sample pairs for fully exploring complementary information. Second, to mitigate the mis-paired issue, we propose a local-graph weighted contrastive learning, which leverages local neighbors to generate pair-wise weights to adaptively strength or weaken the pair-wise contrastive learning. Our method is imputation-free and can be integrated into a unified global-local graph-guided contrastive learning framework.

To address these challenges, we propose AnchorGK, an Anchor-based Incremental and Stratified Graph Learning framework for inductive spatio-temporal kriging. AnchorGK introduces anchor locations to stratify the data in a principled manner. Anchors are constructed according to feature availability, and strata are then formed around these anchors. This stratification serves two complementary roles. First, it explicitly represents and continuously updates correlations between unobserved regions and surrounding observed locations within a graph learning framework. Second, it enables the systematic use of all available features across strata via an incremental representation mechanism, mitigating feature incompleteness without discarding informative signals. Building on the stratified structure, we design a dual-view graph learning layer that jointly aggregates feature-relevant and location-relevant information, learning stratum-specific representations that support accurate inference under inductive settings. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that AnchorGK consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines for spatio-temporal kriging."}

In this paper, we propose a novel, unsupervised, and sample-efficient framework to achieve imitation learning from videos (ILV), named Behavior Cloning from Videos via Latent Representations (BCV-LR). BCV-LR extracts action-related latent features from high-dimensional video inputs through self-supervised tasks, and then leverages a dynamics-based unsupervised objective to predict latent actions between consecutive frames. The pre-trained latent actions are fine-tuned and efficiently aligned to the real action space online (with collected interactions) for policy behavior cloning. The cloned policy in turn enriches the agent experience for further latent action finetuning, resulting in an iterative policy improvement that is highly sample-efficient.\n  We conduct extensive experiments on a set of challenging visual tasks, including both discrete control and continuous control. BCV-LR enables effective (even expert-level on some tasks) policy performance with only a few interactions, surpassing state-of-the-art ILV baselines and reinforcement learning methods (provided with environmental rewards) in terms of sample efficiency across 24/28 tasks.

Class imbalance was quantified using complementary metrics, and we compared the performance of tree-based methods, the state-of-the-art TabNet deep learning model, and a custom lightweight residual network. TabResNet was designed as a computationally efficient alternative to TabNet, replacing its complex attention mechanisms with a streamlined residual architecture to maintain representational capacity for real-time clinical use. All models were optimized via a Bayesian hyperparameter search and assessed on predictive performance, robustness to increasing imbalance, and computational scalability. Our results, on seven clinically vital predictive tasks, show that tree-based methods, particularly XGBoost, consistently achieved the most stable performance across imbalance levels and scaled efficiently with sample size. Deep tabular models degraded more sharply under imbalance and incurred higher computational costs, while TabResNet provided a lighter alternative to TabNet but did not surpass ensemble benchmarks. These findings indicate that in emergency and critical care, robustness to imbalance and computational scalability could outweigh architectural complexity. Tree-based ensemble methods currently offer the most practical and clinically feasible choice, equipping practitioners with a framework for selecting models suited to high-stakes, time-sensitive environments."}

The framework follows a two-stage process: the initial XGBoost model is built using raw data, and once selected as the final model, the dataset is cleaned by (1) removing multicollinear features, (2) identifying outliers with Isolation Forest, and (3) selecting important features using SHAP analysis. The refined dataset as model 2 is then used to retrain XGBoost, which achieves high prediction accuracy across all outputs. A graphical user interface (GUI) is also developed to support material designers. Overall, the proposed framework significantly improves the prediction accuracy and minimizes the need for extensive experimental testing in UHPC mix design."}

Traditional neural network-based solvers, such as Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) and Deep Galerkin Methods, often face challenges in generalization and long-time prediction efficiency due to their dependence on full space-time approximations. To address these issues, we propose a novel and scalable framework that significantly enhances the Neural Galerkin Method (NGM) by incorporating the Meta-Auto-Decoder (MAD) paradigm. Our approach leverages space-time decoupling to enable more stable and efficient time integration, while meta-learning-driven adaptation allows rapid generalization to unseen parameter configurations with minimal retraining. Furthermore, randomized sparse updates effectively reduce computational costs without compromising accuracy. Together, these advancements enable our method to achieve physically consistent, long-horizon predictions for complex parameterized evolution equations with significantly lower computational overhead. Numerical experiments on benchmark problems demonstrate that our methods performs comparatively well in terms of accuracy, robustness, and adaptability."}

Three model families were investigated: Extra Trees with XGBoost (ET-XGB), Random Forest with LightGBM (RF-LGBM), and Transformer with XGBoost (Transformer-XGB). The target properties included compressive strength (CS), flexural strength (FS), and tensile strength (TS), based on an extensive dataset compiled from published experimental studies. Model training involved k-fold cross-validation, hyperparameter optimization, Shapley additive explanations (SHAP), and uncertainty analysis to ensure both robustness and interpretability. Among the tested approaches, the ET-XGB model achieved the highest overall accuracy, with testing R^2 values of 0.994 for CS, 0.944 for FS, and 0.978 for TS and exhibited lowest uncertainty for CS and TS (approximately 13-16% and 30.4%, respectively). The RF-LGBM model provided the most stable and reliable predictions for FS (R^2 0.977), yielding the lowest uncertainty for FS (approximately 5-33%). The Transformer-XGB model demonstrated strong predictive capability (R^2 0.978 for TS and 0.967 for FS) but consistently showed the highest uncertainty, indicating reduced generalization reliability. SHAP analysis further indicated that fiber aspect ratios (AR1 and AR2), silica fume (Sfu), and steel fiber content (SF) were the most influential predictors of strength, whereas water content (W) and the water-binder ratio (w/b) consistently had negative effects. The findings confirm that machine learning models can provide accurate, interpretable, and generalizable predictions of HPC mechanical properties. These models offer valuable tools for optimizing concrete mix design and enhancing structural performance evaluation in engineering applications."}

Central to MCTS is the search strategy, governed by a tree policy based on an upper confidence bound (UCB) applied to trees (UCT). A key factor in the success of AlphaZero is the introduction of a prior term in the UCB1-based tree policy PUCT, which improves exploration efficiency and thus accelerates training. While many alternative UCBs with stronger theoretical guarantees than UCB1 exist, extending them to prior-based UCTs has been challenging, since PUCT was derived empirically rather than from first principles. Recent work retrospectively justified PUCT by framing MCTS as a regularized policy optimization (RPO) problem. Building on this perspective, we introduce Inverse-RPO, a general methodology that systematically derives prior-based UCTs from any prior-free UCB. Applying this method to the variance-aware UCB-V, we obtain two new prior-based tree policies that incorporate variance estimates into the search. Experiments indicate that these variance-aware prior-based UCTs outperform PUCT across multiple benchmarks without incurring additional computational cost. We also provide an extension of the mctx library supporting variance-aware UCTs, showing that the required code changes are minimal and intended to facilitate further research on principled prior-based UCTs.

However, existing methods often suffer from causal blindness, treating process modalities (e.g., real-time video, audio, and sensors) and result modalities (e.g., post-weld images) as equal feature sources, thereby ignoring the inherent physical generative logic. Furthermore, the heterogeneity gap between high-dimensional visual data and low-dimensional sensor signals frequently leads to critical process context being drowned out. In this paper, we propose Causal-HM, a unified multimodal UAD framework that explicitly models the physical Process to Result dependency. Specifically, our framework incorporates two key innovations: a Sensor-Guided CHM Modulation mechanism that utilizes low-dimensional sensor signals as context to guide high-dimensional audio-visual feature extraction , and a Causal-Hierarchical Architecture that enforces a unidirectional generative mapping to identify anomalies that violate physical consistency. Extensive experiments on our newly constructed Weld-4M benchmark across four modalities demonstrate that Causal-HM achieves a state-of-the-art (SOTA) I-AUROC of 90.7%.

To reduce their computational and memory burden, various compression techniques have been proposed, including quantization, pruning, and knowledge distillation. Among these, post-training quantization (PTQ) is widely adopted for its efficiency, as it requires no retraining and only a small dataset for calibration, enabling low-cost deployment. Recent advances for post-training quantization have demonstrated that even sub-4-bit methods can maintain most of the original model performance. However, 1-bit quantization that converts floating-point weights to \\(\\pm\\)1, remains particularly challenging, as existing 1-bit PTQ methods often suffer from significant performance degradation compared to the full-precision models. Specifically, most of existing 1-bit PTQ approaches focus on weight alignment, aligning the full-precision model weights with those of the quantized models, rather than directly aligning their outputs. Although the output-matching approach objective is more intuitive and aligns with the quantization goal, naively applying it in 1-bit LLMs often leads to notable performance degradation. In this paper, we investigate why and under what conditions output-matching fails, in the context of 1-bit LLM quantization. Based on our findings, we propose a novel data-aware PTQ approach for 1-bit LLMs that explicitly accounts for activation error accumulation while keeping optimization efficient. Empirical experiments demonstrate that our solution consistently outperforms existing 1-bit PTQ methods with minimal overhead."}

In this work, we introduce \\emph{Dictionary-Transform Generative Adversarial Networks} (DT-GAN), a fully model-based adversarial framework in which the generator is a sparse synthesis dictionary and the discriminator is an analysis transform acting as an energy model. By restricting both players to linear operators with explicit constraints, DT-GAN departs fundamentally from neural GAN architectures and admits rigorous theoretical analysis.\n  We show that the DT-GAN adversarial game is well posed and admits at least one Nash equilibrium. Under a sparse generative model, equilibrium solutions are provably identifiable up to standard permutation and sign ambiguities and exhibit a precise geometric alignment between synthesis and analysis operators. We further establish finite-sample stability and consistency of empirical equilibria, demonstrating that DT-GAN training converges reliably under standard sampling assumptions and remains robust in heavy-tailed regimes.\n  Experiments on mixture-structured synthetic data validate the theoretical predictions, showing that DT-GAN consistently recovers underlying structure and exhibits stable behavior under identical optimization budgets where a standard GAN degrades. DT-GAN is not proposed as a universal replacement for neural GANs, but as a principled adversarial alternative for data distributions that admit sparse synthesis structure. The results demonstrate that adversarial learning can be made interpretable, stable, and provably correct when grounded in classical sparse modeling."}

In such applications, uncertainty estimation in forecasting is important because it helps evaluate traffic risk levels, assess forecast reliability, and provide timely warnings. As a result, probabilistic traffic flow forecasting (PTFF) has gained significant attention, as it produces both point forecasts and uncertainty estimates. However, existing PTFF approaches still face two key challenges: (1) how to uncover and model the causes of traffic flow uncertainty for reliable forecasting, and (2) how to capture the spatiotemporal correlations of uncertainty for accurate prediction.\n  To address these challenges, we propose RIPCN, a Road Impedance Principal Component Network that integrates domain-specific transportation theory with spatiotemporal principal component learning for PTFF. RIPCN introduces a dynamic impedance evolution network that captures directional traffic transfer patterns driven by road congestion level and flow variability, revealing the direct causes of uncertainty and enhancing both reliability and interpretability. In addition, a principal component network is designed to forecast the dominant eigenvectors of future flow covariance, enabling the model to capture spatiotemporal uncertainty correlations. This design allows for accurate and efficient uncertainty estimation while also improving point prediction performance. Experimental results on real-world datasets show that our approach outperforms existing probabilistic forecasting methods."}

Beneath their apparent diversity lies a recurring pattern: smaller \"compressor\" LMs (that can even run locally) distill raw context into compact text that is then consumed by larger \"predictor\" LMs. Despite their popularity, the design of compressor-predictor systems remains largely ad hoc, with little guidance on how compressor and predictor choices shape downstream performance. In practice, attributing gains to compression versus prediction requires costly, task-specific pairwise sweeps. We argue that these agentic system design questions are, at root, information-theoretic. Viewing the compressor LM as a noisy channel, we introduce a simple estimator of mutual information between the context and its compression to quantify compression quality in a task-independent way. We show that mutual information strongly predicts downstream performance, independent of any specific task. Through an information-theoretic framework, we perform a comprehensive empirical analysis across five datasets and three model families. Results reveal that larger compressors not only are more accurate, but also more token-efficient, conveying more bits of information per token. A 7B Qwen-2.5 compressor, for instance, is $1.6\\times$ more accurate, $4.6\\times$ more concise, and conveys $5.5\\times$ more bits of mutual information per token than its 1.5B sibling. Across datasets, scaling compressors is substantially more effective than scaling predictors, enabling larger on-device compressors to pair with smaller cloud predictors. Applied to a Deep Research system, these principles enable local compressors as small as 3B parameters to recover $99\\%$ of frontier-LM accuracy at $26\\%$ of API costs."}

Existing approaches typically treat all layers uniformly, often trading stability for plasticity or vice versa. However, different layers naturally exhibit varying levels of uncertainty (entropy) when classifying tasks. High-entropy layers tend to underfit by failing to capture task-specific patterns, while low-entropy layers risk overfitting by becoming overly confident and specialized. To address this imbalance, we propose an entropy-aware continual learning method that employs a dynamic feedback mechanism to regulate each layer based on its entropy. Specifically, our approach reduces entropy in high-entropy layers to mitigate underfitting and increases entropy in overly confident layers to alleviate overfitting. This adaptive regulation encourages the model to converge to wider local minima, which have been shown to improve generalization. Our method is general and can be seamlessly integrated with both replay- and regularization-based approaches. Experiments on various datasets demonstrate substantial performance gains over state-of-the-art continual learning baselines."}

We propose a causal explanation method, CENNET, and a new explanation power index using entropy for the method. CENNET provides causal explanations for predictions by NNs and uses structural causal models (SCMs) effectively combined with the NNs although SCMs are usually not used as predictive models on their own in terms of predictive accuracy. We show that CEN-NET provides such explanations through comparative experiments with existing methods on both synthetic and quasi-real data in classification tasks."}

The RL objective for LLM training involves a regularization term, which is the reverse Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between the trained policy and the reference policy. Since computing the KL divergence exactly is intractable, various estimators are used in practice to estimate it from on-policy samples. Despite its wide adoption, including in several open-source libraries, there is no systematic study analyzing the numerous ways of incorporating KL estimators in the objective and their effect on the downstream performance of RL-trained models. Recent works show that prevailing practices for incorporating KL regularization do not provide correct gradients for stated objectives, creating a discrepancy between the objective and its implementation. In this paper, we further analyze these practices and study the gradients of several estimators configurations, revealing how design choices shape gradient bias. We substantiate these findings with empirical observations by RL fine-tuning \\texttt{Qwen2.5-7B}, \\texttt{Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct} and \\texttt{Qwen3-4B-Instruct-2507} with different configurations and evaluating their performance on both in- and out-of-distribution tasks.

To overcome these challenges, we propose the gated quantized variational autoencoder (GQ-VAE), a novel architecture that can be independently pre-trained to serve as a drop-in replacement for existing tokenizers. The key innovation of the architecture is to learn to encode variable-length discrete tokens. GQ-VAE improves compression and language modeling performance over a standard VQ-VAE tokenizer, and approaches the compression rate and language modeling performance of BPE.

Existing solutions leverage generative models to learn original data distributions. However, real-world data are naturally heterogeneous with diverse distributions, making it challenging to obtain a universally good model for diverse data generation. To address this limitation, we introduce Diversity-Aware Tabular data gEnerator (DATE), a framework that (i) prepares high-quality and distributionally distinct examples for in-context learning by effectively partitioning the original heterogeneous data into multiple diverse subsets; (ii) harnesses Large Language Models (LLMs) to explore the diversity of the partitioned distribution with decision tree reasoning as feedback, generating high-quality labeled data for each subset. However, the massive generated data inherently involves a trade-off between diversity and quality. To integrate this issue, existing solutions greedily select the validation-best data. However, we prove that the selection in heterogeneous settings does not possess the greedy-choice property, and design a Multi-Arm Bandit-based sampling algorithm that balances the diversity and quality of generated data. Extensive experiments on tabular classification and regression benchmarks demonstrate that DATE consistently outperforms state-of-the-art GAN-based and LLM-based methods. On average, DATE achieves a 23.75% reduction in error rate with just 100 generated data. Empirically, we demonstrate that data generated by DATE can improve the accuracy of Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) and enhance the reasoning capability of LLMs on the target data.

If the link is wrong, however, inferred rewards can be biased and policies be misaligned. We study policy alignment to preferences under an unknown and unrestricted link. We consider an $f$-divergence-constrained reward maximization problem and show that realizability of the solution in a policy class implies a semiparametric single-index binary choice model, where a scalar-valued index determined by a policy captures the dependence on demonstrations and the rest of the preference distribution is an unrestricted function thereof. Rather than focus on estimation of identifiable finite-dimensional structural parameters in the index as in econometrics, we focus on policy learning, focusing on error to the optimal policy and allowing unidentifiable and nonparametric indices. We develop a variety of policy learners based on profiling the link function, orthogonalizing the link function, and using link-agnostic bipartite ranking objectives. We analyze these and provide finite-sample policy error bounds that depend on generic functional complexity measures of the index class. We further consider practical implementations using first-order optimization suited to neural networks and batched data. The resulting methods are robust to unknown preference noise distribution and scale, while preserving the direct optimization of policies without explicitly fitting rewards."}

Prior work primarily focuses on either the online setting where an agent learns about the unknown environment through iterative interactions, or the offline setting where a policy is learned solely from logged data. However, each of these paradigms has inherent limitations: online algorithms suffer from high interaction costs and slow adaptation, while offline methods are constrained by dataset quality and lack of exploration capabilities. To address these complementary weaknesses, we propose hybrid CMAB-T, a new framework that integrates offline data with online interaction in a principled manner. Our proposed hybrid CUCB algorithm leverages offline data to guide exploration and accelerate convergence, while strategically incorporating online interactions to mitigate the insufficient coverage or distributional bias of the offline dataset. We provide theoretical guarantees on the algorithm's regret, demonstrating that hybrid CUCB significantly outperforms purely online approaches when high-quality offline data is available, and effectively corrects the bias inherent in offline-only methods when the data is limited or misaligned. Empirical results further demonstrate the consistent advantage of our algorithm."}

Traditional computational approaches often rely on experimentally determined 3D structures, which are scarce and computationally expensive to obtain. This paper introduces DuaDeep-SeqAffinity, a novel sequence-only deep learning framework that predicts affinity scores solely from their amino acid sequences using a dual-stream hybrid architecture. Our approach leverages pre-trained ESM-2 protein language model embeddings, combining 1D Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for local motif detection with Transformer encoders for global contextual representation. A subsequent fusion module integrates these multi-faceted features, which are then passed to a fully connected network for final score regression. Experimental results demonstrate that DuaDeep-SeqAffinity significantly outperforms individual architectural components and existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods. DuaDeep achieved a superior Pearson correlation of 0.688, an R^2 of 0.460, and a Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 0.737, surpassing single-branch variants ESM-CNN and ESM-Transformer. Notably, the model achieved an Area Under the Curve (AUC) of 0.890, outperforming sequence-only benchmarks and even surpassing structure-sequence hybrid models. These findings prove that high-fidelity sequence embeddings can capture essential binding patterns typically reserved for structural modeling. By eliminating the reliance on 3D structures, DuaDeep-SeqAffinity provides a highly scalable and efficient solution for high-throughput screening of vast sequence libraries, significantly accelerating the therapeutic discovery pipeline."}

However, conventional attack-based a posteriori robustness assessments incur prohibitive computational overhead. Recently, deep learning methods, such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), have been widely employed as surrogates for rapid robustness prediction. Nevertheless, these methods neglect the complex higher-order correlations prevalent in real-world systems, which are naturally modeled as hypergraphs. Although Hypergraph Neural Networks (HGNNs) have been widely adopted for hypergraph learning, their topological expressive power has not yet reached the theoretical upper bound. To address this limitation, inspired by Graph Isomorphism Networks, this paper proposes a hypergraph-level Hypergraph Isomorphism Network framework. Theoretically, this approach is proven to possess an expressive power strictly equivalent to the Hypergraph Weisfeiler-Lehman test and is applied to predict hypergraph robustness. Experimental results demonstrate that while maintaining superior efficiency in training and prediction, the proposed method not only outperforms existing graph-based models but also significantly surpasses conventional HGNNs in tasks that prioritize topological structure representation."}

While the field has evolved with diverse methods, this rapid surge in diverse methodologies has culminated in a fragmented research landscape. The lack of a unified framework, including inconsistent implementations, conflicting dependencies, and varying evaluation protocols, makes fair comparison and reproducible research increasingly difficult. To address this challenge, we propose LibContinual, a comprehensive and reproducible library designed to serve as a foundational platform for realistic CL. Built upon a high-cohesion, low-coupling modular architecture, LibContinual integrates 19 representative algorithms across five major methodological categories, providing a standardized execution environment. Meanwhile, leveraging this unified framework, we systematically identify and investigate three implicit assumptions prevalent in mainstream evaluation: (1) offline data accessibility, (2) unregulated memory resources, and (3) intra-task semantic homogeneity. We argue that these assumptions often overestimate the real-world applicability of CL methods. Through our comprehensive analysis using strict online CL settings, a novel unified memory budget protocol, and a proposed category-randomized setting, we reveal significant performance drops in many representative CL methods when subjected to these real-world constraints. Our study underscores the necessity of resource-aware and semantically robust CL strategies, and offers LibContinual as a foundational toolkit for future research in realistic continual learning.

Despite advancements in virtual screening, these methods remain time-consuming and costly. Recent progress in deep learning has enabled the development of generative models capable of learning complex molecular representations and generating novel compounds de novo. However, using ML to replace the entire drug-discovery pipeline is highly challenging. In this work, we rather investigate whether generative models can replace one step of the pipeline: hit-like molecule generation. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to explicitly frame hit-like molecule generation as a standalone task and empirically test whether generative models can directly support this stage of the drug discovery pipeline. Specifically, we investigate if such models can be trained to generate hit-like molecules, enabling direct incorporation into, or even substitution of, traditional hit identification workflows. We propose an evaluation framework tailored to this task, integrating physicochemical, structural, and bioactivity-related criteria within a multi-stage filtering pipeline that defines the hit-like chemical space. Two autoregressive and one diffusion-based generative models were benchmarked across various datasets and training settings, with outputs assessed using standard metrics and target-specific docking scores. Our results show that these models can generate valid, diverse, and biologically relevant compounds across multiple targets, with a few selected GSK-3$β$ hits synthesized and confirmed active in vitro.

Specifically, we introduce two principled selection criteria: (1) margin-based sampling, which prioritizes samples near the decision boundary, and (2) gradient-matching sampling, which selects samples whose gradients align with the dominant batch optimization direction. Adversarial examples are generated only for the selected subset, while the remaining samples are trained cleanly using a mixed objective.

Departing from prior toy-model analyses, we rigorously analyze stochastic gradient descent (SGD) training for multi-layer transformers on sequence-to-sequence data with arbitrary data distribution, closely mirroring real-world conditions. Our analysis characterizes the convergence of generalization error to the irreducible risk as computational resources scale with data, especially during the optimization process.\n  We establish a theoretical upper bound on excess risk characterized by a distinct phase transition. In the initial optimization phase, the excess risk decays exponentially relative to the computational cost ${\\sf C}$. However, once a specific resource allocation threshold is crossed, the system enters a statistical phase, where the generalization error follows a power-law decay of $Θ(\\mathsf{C}^{-1/6})$.

We propose a novel multimodal regression framework grounded in Partial Information Decomposition (PID), which decomposes modality-specific representations into unique, redundant, and synergistic components. The basic PID framework is inherently underdetermined. To resolve this, we introduce inductive bias by enforcing Gaussianity in the joint distribution of latent representations and the transformed response variable (after inverse normal transformation), thereby enabling analytical computation of the PID terms. Additionally, we derive a closed-form conditional independence regularizer to promote the isolation of unique information within each modality. Experiments on six real-world datasets, including a case study on large-scale brain age prediction from multimodal neuroimaging data, demonstrate that our framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both predictive accuracy and interpretability, while also enabling informed modality selection for efficient inference.

This paper investigates the impact of on-chip SRAM size and operating frequency on the energy efficiency and performance of LLM inference, focusing on the distinct behaviors of the compute-bound prefill and memory-bound decode phases. Our simulation methodology combines OpenRAM for energy modeling, LLMCompass for latency simulation, and ScaleSIM for systolic array operational intensity. Our findings show that total energy use is predominantly determined by SRAM size in both phases, with larger buffers significantly increasing static energy due to leakage, which is not offset by corresponding latency benefits. We quantitatively explore the memory-bandwidth bottleneck, demonstrating that while high operating frequencies reduce prefill latency, their positive impact on memory-bound decode latency is capped by the external memory bandwidth. Counter-intuitively, high compute frequency can reduce total energy by reducing execution time and consequently decreasing static energy consumption more than the resulting dynamic power increase. We identify an optimal hardware configuration for the simulated workload: high operating frequencies (1200MHz-1400MHz) and a small local buffer size of 32KB to 64KB. This combination achieves the best energy-delay product, balancing low latency with high energy efficiency. Furthermore, we demonstrate how memory bandwidth acts as a performance ceiling, and that increasing compute frequency only yields performance gains up to the point where the workload becomes memory-bound. This analysis provides concrete architectural insights for designing energy-efficient LLM accelerators, especially for datacenters aiming to minimize their energy overhead."}
