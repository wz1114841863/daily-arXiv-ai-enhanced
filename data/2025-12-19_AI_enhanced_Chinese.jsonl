Artificial networks typically replicate this via recurrent or parallel architectures, yet incur high energy costs and noise sensitivity. Here we report IPNet, a hardware-software co-designed neuromorphic architecture realizing human-like working memory via neuronal intrinsic plasticity. Exploiting Joule-heating dynamics of Magnetic Tunnel Junctions (MTJs), IPNet physically emulates biological memory volatility. The memory behavior of the proposed architecture shows similar trends in n-back, free recall and memory interference tasks to that of reported human subjects. Implemented exclusively with MTJ neurons, the architecture with human-like working memory achieves 99.65% accuracy on 11-class DVS gesture datasets and maintains 99.48% on a novel 22-class time-reversed benchmark, outperforming RNN, LSTM, and 2+1D CNN baselines sharing identical backbones. For autonomous driving (DDD-20), IPNet reduces steering prediction error by 14.4% compared to ResNet-LSTM. Architecturally, we identify a 'Memory-at-the-Frontier' effect where performance is maximized at the sensing interface, validating a bio-plausible near-sensor processing paradigm. Crucially, all results rely on raw parameters from fabricated devices without optimization. Hardware-in-the-loop validation confirms the system's physical realizability. Separately, energy analysis reveals a reduction in memory power of 2,874x compared to LSTMs and 90,920x versus parallel 3D-CNNs. This capacitor-free design enables a compact ~1.5um2 footprint (28 nm CMOS): a >20-fold reduction over standard LIF neurons. Ultimately, we demonstrate that instantiating human-like working memory via intrinsic neuronal plasticity endows neural networks with the dual biological advantages of superior dynamic vision processing and minimal metabolic cost.", "AI": {"tldr": "IPNet\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u78c1\u96a7\u9053\u7ed3\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u5f62\u6001\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\u5185\u5728\u53ef\u5851\u6027\u5b9e\u73b0\u7c7b\u4eba\u5de5\u4f5c\u8bb0\u5fc6\uff0c\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u89c6\u89c9\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\u4e14\u80fd\u8017\u6781\u4f4e\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u4eba\u5de5\u7f51\u7edc\u901a\u8fc7\u5faa\u73af\u6216\u5e76\u884c\u67b6\u6784\u5b9e\u73b0\u5de5\u4f5c\u8bb0\u5fc6\uff0c\u4f46\u5b58\u5728\u80fd\u8017\u9ad8\u548c\u566a\u58f0\u654f\u611f\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u66f4\u63a5\u8fd1\u751f\u7269\u5de5\u4f5c\u8bb0\u5fc6\u673a\u5236\u7684\u4f4e\u529f\u8017\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u78c1\u96a7\u9053\u7ed3\u7684\u7126\u8033\u70ed\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u7269\u7406\u6a21\u62df\u751f\u7269\u8bb0\u5fc6\u7684\u6613\u5931\u6027\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u57fa\u4e8e\u5185\u5728\u53ef\u5851\u6027\u7684\u786c\u4ef6-\u8f6f\u4ef6\u534f\u540c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u795e\u7ecf\u5f62\u6001\u67b6\u6784IPNet\u3002", "result": "\u572811\u7c7bDVS\u624b\u52bf\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fbe\u523099.65%\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u572822\u7c7b\u65f6\u95f4\u53cd\u8f6c\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u4fdd\u630199.48%\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8eRNN\u3001LSTM\u548c2+1D CNN\u3002\u80fd\u8017\u6bd4LSTM\u964d\u4f4e2874\u500d\uff0c\u6bd43D-CNN\u964d\u4f4e90920\u500d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\u5185\u5728\u53ef\u5851\u6027\u5b9e\u73b0\u7c7b\u4eba\u5de5\u4f5c\u8bb0\u5fc6\uff0c\u8d4b\u4e88\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u4f18\u8d8a\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u89c6\u89c9\u5904\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u6781\u4f4e\u7684\u4ee3\u8c22\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u751f\u7269\u5408\u7406\u7684\u8fd1\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u5904\u7406\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

However, most existing technologies for measuring Pb are labor-intensive and costly. In this study, we propose SoilScanner, a radio frequency-based wireless system that can detect Pb in soils. This is based on our discovery that the propagation of different frequency band radio signals is affected differently by different salts such as NaCl and Pb(NO3)2 in the soil. In a controlled experiment, manually adding NaCl and Pb(NO3)2 in clean soil, we demonstrated that different salts reflected signals at different frequencies in distinct patterns. In addition, we confirmed the finding using uncontrolled field samples with a machine learning model. Our experiment results show that SoilScanner can classify soil samples into low-Pb and high-Pb categories (threshold at 200 ppm) with an accuracy of 72%, with no sample with > 500 ppm of Pb being misclassified.

Branch prediction is a pattern recognition problem that learns mappings between a context to the branch outcome. An accurate predictor reduces the number of instructions executed on the wrong path resulting in an improvement of performance and energy consumption. In this paper, we present a workload characterization methodology for branch prediction. We propose two new workload-driven branch prediction accuracy identifiers -- branch working set size and branch predictability. These parameters are highly correlated with misprediction rates of modern branch prediction schemes (e.g. TAGE and perceptron). We define the branch working set of a trace as a group of most frequently occurring branch contexts, i.e. the 3-part tuple of branch address, and associated global and local history. We analyze the branch working set's size and predictability on a per-trace basis to study its relationship with a modern branch predictor's accuracy. We have characterized 2,451 workload traces into seven branch working set size and nine predictability categories after analyzing their branch behavior. We present further insights into the source of prediction accuracy and favored workload categories for modern branch predictors.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5206\u652f\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u5de5\u4f5c\u8d1f\u8f7d\u7279\u5f81\u5206\u6790\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u652f\u5de5\u4f5c\u96c6\u5927\u5c0f\u548c\u5206\u652f\u53ef\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u4e24\u4e2a\u65b0\u6307\u6807\u6765\u8bc4\u4f30\u73b0\u4ee3\u5206\u652f\u9884\u6d4b\u5668\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u6761\u4ef6\u5206\u652f\u9884\u6d4b\u662f\u6a21\u5f0f\u8bc6\u522b\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u51c6\u786e\u9884\u6d4b\u53ef\u4ee5\u51cf\u5c11\u9519\u8bef\u8def\u5f84\u4e0a\u7684\u6307\u4ee4\u6267\u884c\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u964d\u4f4e\u80fd\u8017\u3002\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u5de5\u4f5c\u8d1f\u8f7d\u7279\u5f81\u5206\u6790\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u7406\u89e3\u5206\u652f\u9884\u6d4b\u5668\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u5de5\u4f5c\u8d1f\u8f7d\u7684\u5206\u652f\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u6807\u8bc6\u7b26\uff1a\u5206\u652f\u5de5\u4f5c\u96c6\u5927\u5c0f\u548c\u5206\u652f\u53ef\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u3002\u5206\u652f\u5de5\u4f5c\u96c6\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e3a\u6700\u5e38\u51fa\u73b0\u7684\u5206\u652f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\uff08\u5206\u652f\u5730\u5740\u3001\u5168\u5c40\u5386\u53f2\u3001\u5c40\u90e8\u5386\u53f2\u7684\u4e09\u5143\u7ec4\uff09\u3002\u5206\u6790\u4e862,451\u4e2a\u5de5\u4f5c\u8d1f\u8f7d\u8ddf\u8e2a\uff0c\u5c06\u5176\u5206\u4e3a7\u4e2a\u5206\u652f\u5de5\u4f5c\u96c6\u5927\u5c0f\u7c7b\u522b\u548c9\u4e2a\u53ef\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u7c7b\u522b\u3002", "result": "\u5206\u652f\u5de5\u4f5c\u96c6\u5927\u5c0f\u548c\u5206\u652f\u53ef\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u4e0e\u73b0\u4ee3\u5206\u652f\u9884\u6d4b\u65b9\u6848\uff08\u5982TAGE\u548c\u611f\u77e5\u5668\uff09\u7684\u8bef\u9884\u6d4b\u7387\u9ad8\u5ea6\u76f8\u5173\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u5206\u652f\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5bf9\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u6765\u6e90\u7684\u6df1\u5165\u89c1\u89e3\uff0c\u5e76\u786e\u5b9a\u4e86\u73b0\u4ee3\u5206\u652f\u9884\u6d4b\u5668\u504f\u597d\u7684\u5de5\u4f5c\u8d1f\u8f7d\u7c7b\u522b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u5de5\u4f5c\u8d1f\u8f7d\u7279\u5f81\u5206\u6790\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u8bc4\u4f30\u5206\u652f\u9884\u6d4b\u5668\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u5206\u652f\u5de5\u4f5c\u96c6\u5927\u5c0f\u548c\u53ef\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u662f\u4e0e\u8bef\u9884\u6d4b\u7387\u9ad8\u5ea6\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u5173\u952e\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u4e3a\u73b0\u4ee3\u5206\u652f\u9884\u6d4b\u5668\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u5206\u6790\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u89c6\u89d2\u3002"}}

What am I looking at?, etc.). These devices will sense an egocentric view of the world around us to observe all human- relevant signals across space and time to construct and maintain a user's personal context. This personal context, combined with advanced generative AI, will unlock a powerful new generation of contextual AI personal assistants and applications. However, designing a wearable system to support contextual AI is a daunting task because of the system's complexity and stringent power constraints due to weight and battery restrictions. To understand how to guide design for such systems, this work provides the first complete system architecture view of one such wearable contextual AI system (Aria2), along with the lessons we have learned through the system modeling and design space exploration process. We show that an end-to-end full system model view of such systems is vitally important, as no single component or category overwhelmingly dominates system power. This means long-range design decisions and power optimizations need to be made in the full system context to avoid running into limits caused by other system bottlenecks (i.e., Amdahl's law as applied to power) or as bottlenecks change. Finally, we reflect on lessons and insights for the road ahead, which will be important toward eventually enabling all-day, wearable, contextual AI systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u9762\u5411\u4e0b\u4e00\u4ee3\u60c5\u5883AI\u7684\u53ef\u7a7f\u6234\u7cfb\u7edf\u67b6\u6784\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u4ee5Aria2\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e3a\u4f8b\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u5168\u7cfb\u7edf\u5efa\u6a21\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u56e0\u5355\u4e00\u7ec4\u4ef6\u4f18\u5316\u800c\u9047\u5230\u5176\u4ed6\u7cfb\u7edf\u74f6\u9888\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e0b\u4e00\u4ee3\u4eba\u673a\u4ea4\u4e92\u9700\u8981\u5168\u5929\u5019\u3001\u7a7a\u95f4\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u53ef\u7a7f\u6234\u8bbe\u5907\u6765\u6355\u83b7\u81ea\u6211\u4e2d\u5fc3\u89c6\u89c9\u548c\u529f\u80fd\u539f\u8bed\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u7528\u6237\u4e2a\u4eba\u60c5\u5883\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u751f\u6210\u5f0fAI\u5b9e\u73b0\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u60c5\u5883AI\u52a9\u624b\u3002\u4f46\u8fd9\u7c7b\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bbe\u8ba1\u590d\u6742\u4e14\u53d7\u4e25\u683c\u7684\u529f\u8017\u9650\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u9996\u4e2a\u5b8c\u6574\u7684\u53ef\u7a7f\u6234\u60c5\u5883AI\u7cfb\u7edf\uff08Aria2\uff09\u67b6\u6784\u89c6\u56fe\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7cfb\u7edf\u5efa\u6a21\u548c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7a7a\u95f4\u63a2\u7d22\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u5168\u7cfb\u7edf\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5728\u8fd9\u79cd\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\uff0c\u6ca1\u6709\u4efb\u4f55\u5355\u4e00\u7ec4\u4ef6\u6216\u7c7b\u522b\u5b8c\u5168\u4e3b\u5bfc\u7cfb\u7edf\u529f\u8017\uff0c\u8fd9\u610f\u5473\u7740\u9700\u8981\u5728\u5168\u7cfb\u7edf\u80cc\u666f\u4e0b\u8fdb\u884c\u957f\u671f\u8bbe\u8ba1\u51b3\u7b56\u548c\u529f\u8017\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u56e0\u5176\u4ed6\u7cfb\u7edf\u74f6\u9888\u800c\u53d7\u9650\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u5168\u7cfb\u7edf\u89c6\u56fe\u5bf9\u4e8e\u53ef\u7a7f\u6234\u60c5\u5883AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bbe\u8ba1\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u907f\u514dAmdahl\u5b9a\u5f8b\u5728\u529f\u8017\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u89c1\u89e3\u5bf9\u6700\u7ec8\u5b9e\u73b0\u5168\u5929\u5019\u53ef\u7a7f\u6234\u60c5\u5883AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\u3002"}}

These \"setup times\" can wreak havoc on a system's queueing; this is especially true in modern systems, where servers are regularly turned on and off as a way to reduce operating costs (energy, labor, CO2, etc.). To design modern systems which are both efficient and performant, we need to understand how setup times affect queues.\n  Unfortunately, despite successes in understanding setup in a single-server system, setup in a multiserver system remains poorly understood. To circumvent the main difficulty in analyzing multiserver setup, all existing results assume that setup times are memoryless, i.e. distributed Exponentially. However, in most practical settings, setup times are close to Deterministic, and the widely used Exponential-setup assumption leads to unrealistic model behavior and a dramatic underestimation of the true harm caused by setup times.\n  This paper provides a comprehensive characterization of the average waiting time in a multiserver system with Deterministic setup times, the M/M/k/Setup-Deterministic. In particular, we derive upper and lower bounds on the average waiting time in this system, and show these bounds are within a multiplicative constant of each other. These bounds are the first closed-form characterization of waiting time in any finite-server system with setup times. Further, we demonstrate how to combine our upper and lower bounds to derive a simple and accurate approximation for the average waiting time. These results are all made possible via a new technique for analyzing random time integrals that we named the Method of Intervening Stopping Times, or MIST.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u9996\u6b21\u63a8\u5bfc\u51fa\u5177\u6709\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u8bbe\u7f6e\u65f6\u95f4\u7684\u591a\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u7cfb\u7edf(M/M/k/Setup-Deterministic)\u4e2d\u5e73\u5747\u7b49\u5f85\u65f6\u95f4\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u754c\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86MIST\u65b0\u5206\u6790\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u4ee3\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u7ecf\u5e38\u5f00\u5173\u4ee5\u964d\u4f4e\u8fd0\u8425\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u4f46\u8bbe\u7f6e\u65f6\u95f4\u4f1a\u5bf9\u6392\u961f\u6027\u80fd\u4ea7\u751f\u4e25\u91cd\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u90fd\u5047\u8bbe\u8bbe\u7f6e\u65f6\u95f4\u670d\u4ece\u6307\u6570\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u800c\u5b9e\u9645\u8bbe\u7f6e\u65f6\u95f4\u63a5\u8fd1\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u6307\u6570\u5047\u8bbe\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u6a21\u578b\u884c\u4e3a\u4e0d\u73b0\u5b9e\u5e76\u4e25\u91cd\u4f4e\u4f30\u8bbe\u7f6e\u65f6\u95f4\u7684\u5371\u5bb3\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u540d\u4e3a\"\u5e72\u9884\u505c\u6b62\u65f6\u95f4\u65b9\u6cd5(MIST)\"\u7684\u65b0\u6280\u672f\u6765\u5206\u6790\u968f\u673a\u65f6\u95f4\u79ef\u5206\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u63a8\u5bfc\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u8bbe\u7f6e\u65f6\u95f4\u591a\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5e73\u5747\u7b49\u5f85\u65f6\u95f4\u4e0a\u4e0b\u754c\u3002", "result": "\u9996\u6b21\u83b7\u5f97\u4e86\u6709\u9650\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bbe\u7f6e\u65f6\u95f4\u4e0b\u7684\u95ed\u5f0f\u7b49\u5f85\u65f6\u95f4\u8868\u5f81\uff0c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u754c\u5728\u4e58\u6cd5\u5e38\u6570\u8303\u56f4\u5185\u76f8\u4e92\u63a5\u8fd1\uff0c\u5e76\u57fa\u4e8e\u8fd9\u4e9b\u754c\u63a8\u5bfc\u51fa\u7b80\u5355\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u8fd1\u4f3c\u516c\u5f0f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u586b\u8865\u4e86\u591a\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u7cfb\u7edf\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u8bbe\u7f6e\u65f6\u95f4\u5206\u6790\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u7a7a\u767d\uff0c\u4e3a\u8bbe\u8ba1\u65e2\u9ad8\u6548\u53c8\u6027\u80fd\u826f\u597d\u7684\u73b0\u4ee3\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

LOG.io supports a general programming model, accommodating non-deterministic operators, interactions with external systems, and arbitrary custom code. It is non-blocking, allowing failed operators to recover independently without interrupting other active operators, thereby leveraging data parallelization, and it facilitates dynamic scaling of operators during pipeline execution. Performance evaluations, conducted within the SAP Data Intelligence system, compare LOG.io with the Asynchronous Barrier Snapshotting (ABS) protocol, originally implemented in Flink. Our experiments show that when there are straggler operators in a data pipeline and the throughput of events is moderate (e.g., 1 event every 100 ms), LOG.io performs as well as ABS during normal processing and outperforms ABS during recovery. Otherwise, ABS performs better than LOG.io for both normal processing and recovery. However, we show that in these cases, data parallelization can largely reduce the overhead of LOG.io while ABS does not improve. Finally, we show that the overhead of data lineage capture, at the granularity of the event and between any two operators in a pipeline, is marginal, with less than 1.5% in all our experiments.", "AI": {"tldr": "LOG.io \u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e3a\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u6570\u636e\u6d41\u6c34\u7ebf\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u6b63\u786e\u7684\u56de\u6eda\u6062\u590d\u548c\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u6570\u636e\u6eaf\u6e90\u6355\u83b7\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u65e0\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u4f18\u4e8e\u5f02\u6b65\u5c4f\u969c\u5feb\u7167\u534f\u8bae\u3002", "motivation": "\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u6570\u636e\u6d41\u6c34\u7ebf\u9700\u8981\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u5bb9\u9519\u673a\u5236\u548c\u6570\u636e\u6eaf\u6e90\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u5982Flink\u7684\u5f02\u6b65\u5c4f\u969c\u5feb\u7167\u534f\u8bae\u5728\u5904\u7406\u5f02\u6784\u64cd\u4f5c\u7b26\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u6269\u5c55\u65f6\u5b58\u5728\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u7075\u6d3b\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u6062\u590d\u548c\u6eaf\u6e90\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u65e5\u5fd7\u7684\u56de\u6eda\u6062\u590d\u534f\u8bae\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u901a\u7528\u7f16\u7a0b\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u53ef\u5904\u7406\u975e\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u64cd\u4f5c\u7b26\u3001\u5916\u90e8\u7cfb\u7edf\u4ea4\u4e92\u548c\u81ea\u5b9a\u4e49\u4ee3\u7801\u3002\u5b9e\u73b0\u975e\u963b\u585e\u6062\u590d\uff0c\u5141\u8bb8\u5931\u8d25\u64cd\u4f5c\u7b26\u72ec\u7acb\u6062\u590d\u800c\u4e0d\u5f71\u54cd\u5176\u4ed6\u64cd\u4f5c\u7b26\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u6570\u636e\u5e76\u884c\u5316\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u6269\u5c55\u3002", "result": "\u5728SAP Data Intelligence\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u5f53\u6d41\u6c34\u7ebf\u5b58\u5728\u5ef6\u8fdf\u64cd\u4f5c\u7b26\u4e14\u4e8b\u4ef6\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u9002\u4e2d\u65f6\uff0cLOG.io\u5728\u6b63\u5e38\u5904\u7406\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4e0eABS\u76f8\u5f53\uff0c\u5728\u6062\u590d\u65f6\u4f18\u4e8eABS\u3002\u6570\u636e\u5e76\u884c\u5316\u53ef\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11LOG.io\u5f00\u9500\uff0c\u800c\u6570\u636e\u6eaf\u6e90\u6355\u83b7\u7684\u5f00\u9500\u5728\u6240\u6709\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u4f4e\u4e8e1.5%\u3002", "conclusion": "LOG.io\u4e3a\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u6570\u636e\u6d41\u6c34\u7ebf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u7684\u56de\u6eda\u6062\u590d\u548c\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u6570\u636e\u6eaf\u6e90\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e14\u6eaf\u6e90\u5f00\u9500\u53ef\u5ffd\u7565\u4e0d\u8ba1\uff0c\u9002\u5408\u65e0\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u67b6\u6784\u7684\u5f39\u6027\u9700\u6c42\u3002"}}

Prior work focused on first-generation AIE kernel optimizations, without tackling full neural network execution across the 2D array. In this work, we present AIE4ML, the first comprehensive framework for converting AI models automatically into optimized firmware targeting the AIE-ML generation devices, also with forward compatibility for the newer AIE-MLv2 architecture. At the single-kernel level, we attain performance close to the architectural peak. At the graph and system levels, we provide a structured parallelization method that can scale across the 2D AIE-ML fabric and exploit its dedicated memory tiles to stay entirely on-chip throughout the model execution. As a demonstration, we designed a generalized and highly efficient linear-layer implementation with intrinsic support for fused bias addition and ReLU activation. Also, as our framework necessitates the generation of multi-layer implementations, our approach systematically derives deterministic, compact, and topology-optimized placements tailored to the physical 2D grid of the device through a novel graph placement and search algorithm. Finally, the framework seamlessly accepts quantized models imported from high-level tools such as hls4ml or PyTorch while preserving bit-exactness. In layer scaling benchmarks, we achieve up to 98.6% efficiency relative to the single-kernel baseline, utilizing 296 of 304 AIE tiles (97.4%) of the device with entirely on-chip data movement. With evaluations across real-world model topologies, we demonstrate that AIE4ML delivers GPU-class throughput under microsecond latency constraints, making it a practical companion for ultra-low-latency environments such as trigger systems in particle physics experiments.", "AI": {"tldr": "AIE4ML\u662f\u9996\u4e2a\u9488\u5bf9AMD Versal AIE-ML\u67b6\u6784\u7684\u5168\u9762AI\u6a21\u578b\u81ea\u52a8\u4f18\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u63a5\u8fd1\u67b6\u6784\u5cf0\u503c\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u5168\u7247\u4e0a\u6267\u884c\uff0c\u5728\u7c92\u5b50\u7269\u7406\u7b49\u8d85\u4f4e\u5ef6\u8fdf\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u8fbe\u5230GPU\u7ea7\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728AMD Versal AI Engine\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u9ad8\u6548AI\u63a8\u7406\u9762\u4e34\u6311\u6218\uff1aVLIW\u6267\u884c\u7d27\u5bc6\u8026\u5408\u3001\u6570\u636e\u8def\u5f84\u663e\u5f0f\u7ba1\u7406\u3001\u672c\u5730\u5185\u5b58\u7ba1\u7406\u590d\u6742\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u5de5\u4f5c\u4ec5\u5173\u6ce8\u5355\u6838\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u672a\u89e3\u51b3\u8de82D\u9635\u5217\u7684\u5b8c\u6574\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u6267\u884c\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "1) \u5355\u6838\u7ea7\u4f18\u5316\u8fbe\u5230\u67b6\u6784\u5cf0\u503c\u6027\u80fd\uff1b2) \u56fe\u7ea7\u548c\u7cfb\u7edf\u7ea7\u63d0\u4f9b\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u5e76\u884c\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5229\u75282D AIE-ML\u9635\u5217\u548c\u4e13\u7528\u5185\u5b58\u74e6\u7247\u5b9e\u73b0\u5168\u7247\u4e0a\u6267\u884c\uff1b3) \u5f00\u53d1\u9ad8\u6548\u7ebf\u6027\u5c42\u5b9e\u73b0\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u504f\u7f6e\u52a0\u6cd5\u548cReLU\u6fc0\u6d3b\u878d\u5408\uff1b4) \u901a\u8fc7\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u56fe\u653e\u7f6e\u548c\u641c\u7d22\u7b97\u6cd5\u751f\u6210\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u3001\u7d27\u51d1\u3001\u62d3\u6251\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u5e03\u5c40\uff1b5) \u65e0\u7f1d\u96c6\u6210hls4ml/PyTorch\u91cf\u5316\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4fdd\u6301\u4f4d\u7cbe\u786e\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5c42\u6269\u5c55\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u8fbe\u5230\u5355\u6838\u57fa\u7ebf98.6%\u7684\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528304\u4e2aAIE\u74e6\u7247\u4e2d\u7684296\u4e2a\uff0897.4%\uff09\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5168\u7247\u4e0a\u6570\u636e\u79fb\u52a8\u3002\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u6a21\u578b\u62d3\u6251\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\uff0c\u5728\u5fae\u79d2\u7ea7\u5ef6\u8fdf\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b\u63d0\u4f9bGPU\u7ea7\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u3002", "conclusion": "AIE4ML\u662f\u9996\u4e2a\u9488\u5bf9AMD AIE-ML\u67b6\u6784\u7684\u5168\u9762AI\u6a21\u578b\u4f18\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u63a5\u8fd1\u7406\u8bba\u5cf0\u503c\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u9ad8\u8d44\u6e90\u5229\u7528\u7387\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u7c92\u5b50\u7269\u7406\u89e6\u53d1\u7cfb\u7edf\u7b49\u8d85\u4f4e\u5ef6\u8fdf\u73af\u5883\uff0c\u6210\u4e3a\u5b9e\u9645\u53ef\u884c\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Although intra-server multipath data transfer between GPU and host memory is theoretically possible, heterogeneous protocols such as PCIe and NVLink currently limit the bandwidth between host memory and GPUs to that of a single PICe link. This limitation resuals in underutilized intra-server bandwidth. To address this issue, we propose Multipath Memory Access (MMA), a scheme that, to the best of our knowledge, is the first to enalbe efficient multipath data transfer between GPU and host memory. MMA supports seamless deployment via dynamic library injection, enabling LLM applications to benefit from MMA without requiring any code modification. In our testbed, MMA significantly improves the data transfer bandwidth between the GPU and memory, achieving a peak bandwidth of 245 GB/s-representing a 4.62x speedup compared to the natice single-path bandwidth. End-to-end evaluations demonstrate that MMA reduces the time-to-first-token (TTFT) for LLM serving by 1.14x to 2.38x and decreases model-switching latency in vLLM's sleep mode by 1.12x to 2.48x.", "AI": {"tldr": "MMA\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u8def\u5f84\u5185\u5b58\u8bbf\u95ee\u6280\u672f\u89e3\u51b3PCIe\u5e26\u5bbd\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u63d0\u5347GPU\u4e0e\u4e3b\u673a\u5185\u5b58\u95f4\u6570\u636e\u4f20\u8f93\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u52a0\u901fLLM\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u5207\u6362", "motivation": "PCIe\u5e26\u5bbd\u5df2\u6210\u4e3a\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5173\u952e\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u524d\u7f00\u7f13\u5b58\u83b7\u53d6\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u5207\u6362\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u3002\u867d\u7136\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728GPU\u548c\u4e3b\u673a\u5185\u5b58\u4e4b\u95f4\u8fdb\u884c\u591a\u8def\u5f84\u6570\u636e\u4f20\u8f93\uff0c\u4f46PCIe\u548cNVLink\u7b49\u5f02\u6784\u534f\u8bae\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5b9e\u9645\u5e26\u5bbd\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u5185\u90e8\u5e26\u5bbd\u672a\u5145\u5206\u5229\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u591a\u8def\u5f84\u5185\u5b58\u8bbf\u95ee(MMA)\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u9996\u6b21\u5b9e\u73b0GPU\u4e0e\u4e3b\u673a\u5185\u5b58\u95f4\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u591a\u8def\u5f84\u6570\u636e\u4f20\u8f93\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u5e93\u6ce8\u5165\u5b9e\u73b0\u65e0\u7f1d\u90e8\u7f72\uff0c\u4f7fLLM\u5e94\u7528\u65e0\u9700\u4ee3\u7801\u4fee\u6539\u5373\u53ef\u53d7\u76ca\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5e73\u53f0\u4e0a\uff0cMMA\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347GPU\u4e0e\u5185\u5b58\u95f4\u6570\u636e\u4f20\u8f93\u5e26\u5bbd\uff0c\u5cf0\u503c\u5e26\u5bbd\u8fbe245 GB/s\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u539f\u751f\u5355\u8def\u5f84\u5e26\u5bbd\u63d0\u53474.62\u500d\u3002\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u8bc4\u4f30\u663e\u793a\uff0cMMA\u5c06LLM\u670d\u52a1\u7684\u9996\u4ee4\u724c\u65f6\u95f4(TTFT)\u964d\u4f4e1.14-2.38\u500d\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06vLLM\u7761\u7720\u6a21\u5f0f\u4e0b\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u5207\u6362\u5ef6\u8fdf\u964d\u4f4e1.12-2.48\u500d\u3002", "conclusion": "MMA\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86PCIe\u5e26\u5bbd\u74f6\u9888\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u8def\u5f84\u6570\u636e\u4f20\u8f93\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347LLM\u63a8\u7406\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u5207\u6362\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u4e14\u65e0\u9700\u4fee\u6539\u5e94\u7528\u4ee3\u7801\u5373\u53ef\u90e8\u7f72\u3002"}}

Motivated by the demand for real-time situational awareness and intelligent operational maintenance, digital twin (DT) technology was initially regarded as a promising solution, owing to its capability to create virtual replicas and emulate physical system behaviors. However, in the context of SAGSIN, the high-fidelity, full-scale modeling paradigm inherent to conventional DTs encounters fundamental limitations, including prohibitive computational overhead, delayed model synchronization, and cross-system semantic gaps. To address these limitations, this survey paper proposes a novel twinning framework: goal-oriented semantic twin (GOST). Unlike DTs that pursue physical mirroring, GOST prioritizes ``utility'' over ``fidelity,'' leveraging semantic technologies and goal-oriented principles to construct lightweight, task-specific representations. This paper systematically articulates the GOST framework through three layers: knowledge-based semantics, data-driven semantics, and goal-oriented principles. Furthermore, we provide a comprehensive tutorial on constructing GOST by detailing its core enabling technologies and introduce a multidimensional evaluation framework for GOST. We present a case study targeting collaborative tracking tasks in remote satellite-UAV networks, demonstrating that GOST significantly outperforms conventional DTs in timeliness of perceptual data and collaborative tracking.

However, recent studies highlight the importance of high-frequency signals. The role of low-frequency and high-frequency graph signals in recommendation remains unclear. This paper aims to bridge this gap by investigating the influence of graph signals on recommendation performance. We theoretically prove that the effects of low-frequency and high-frequency graph signals are equivalent in recommendation tasks, as both contribute by smoothing the similarities between user-item pairs. To leverage this insight, we propose a frequency signal scaler, a plug-and-play module that adjusts the graph signal filter function to fine-tune the smoothness between user-item pairs, making it compatible with any GNN model. Additionally, we identify and prove that graph embedding-based methods cannot fully capture the characteristics of graph signals. To address this limitation, a space flip method is introduced to restore the expressive power of graph embeddings. Remarkably, we demonstrate that either low-frequency or high-frequency graph signals alone are sufficient for effective recommendations. Extensive experiments on four public datasets validate the effectiveness of our proposed methods.

Building on these insights, we introduce SCABENCH, a reproducible benchmark, and INITSCOPE, a lightweight analysis framework linking what code is loaded with what is executed. On SCABENCH, INITSCOPE improved localization accuracy by up to 40% and reduced diagnostic effort by 64% compared with prior tools, while a developer study showed higher task accuracy and faster diagnosis.

Instead of costly training from scratch, LLaDA2.0 upholds knowledge inheritance, progressive adaption and efficiency-aware design principle, and seamless converts a pre-trained AR model into dLLM with a novel 3-phase block-level WSD based training scheme: progressive increasing block-size in block diffusion (warm-up), large-scale full-sequence diffusion (stable) and reverting back to compact-size block diffusion (decay).

Among sharing techniques, NVIDIA's Multi-Instance GPU (MIG) offers strong resource isolation by enabling hardware-level GPU partitioning. However, leveraging MIG effectively introduces new challenges. First, resource contention persists due to shared components such as PCIe bandwidth. Second, GPU fragmentation becomes a critical issue, which is different from prior fine-grained GPU sharing work due to MIG's limited number of valid MIG configurations. Fragmentation arises not only from spatial discontinuity but also from rigid profile placement constraints, especially after job arrivals and terminations. To address these issues, we propose an online scheduling framework that integrates conditional load balancing, dynamic partitioning, and job migration. Our approach dynamically adapts job placement to minimize contention and reorganizes GPU allocations to combat both internal and external fragmentation. Experimental results show that our method significantly improves system efficiency.

This is exacerbated by the high-dimensional design spaces associated with finely resolved images, multimodal input property streams, and a highly nonlinear forward physics. Whilst modern generative models excel at accurately modeling such complex forward behavior, most of them are not intrinsically structured to support fast, stable \\emph{deterministic} inversion with a physics-informed bias. This work introduces Janus, a unified generative-predictive framework to address this problem. Janus couples a deep encoder-decoder architecture with a predictive KHRONOS head, a separable neural architecture. Topologically speaking, Janus learns a latent manifold simultaneously isometric for generative inversion and pruned for physical prediction; the joint objective inducing \\emph{disentanglement} of the latent space. Janus is first validated on the MNIST dataset, demonstrating high-fidelity reconstruction, accurate classification and diverse generative inversion of all ten target classes. It is then applied to the inverse design of heterogeneous microstructures labeled with thermal conductivity. It achieves a forward prediction accuracy $R^2=0.98$ (2\\% relative error) and sub-5\\% pixelwise reconstruction error. Inverse solutions satisfy target properties to within $1\\%$ relative error. Inverting a sweep through properties reveal smooth traversal of the latent manifold, and UMAP visualization confirms the emergence of a low-dimensional, disentangled manifold.

Unlike traditional deployments where schedulers can treat instances as black boxes, DP+EP architectures exhibit high internal synchronization costs. We identify that immediate request dispatching in such systems leads to severe in-engine queuing and parallelization bubbles, degrading Time-to-First-Token (TTFT). To address this, we propose Staggered Batch Scheduling (SBS), a mechanism that deliberately buffers requests to form optimal execution batches. This temporal decoupling eliminates internal queuing bubbles without compromising throughput. Furthermore, leveraging the scheduling window created by buffering, we introduce a Load-Aware Global Allocation strategy that balances computational load across DP units for both Prefill and Decode phases.

Multimodal models such as CLIP have been able to perform well on this task by learning semantic similarities across vision and language; however, despite these advances, image classification is still a challenging task. Models with low capacity often suffer from underfitting and thus underperform on fine-grained image classification. Along with this, it is important to ensure high-quality data with rich cross-modal representations of each class, which is often difficult to generate. When datasets do not enforce balanced demographics, the predictions will be biased toward the more represented class, while others will be neglected. We focus on how these issues can lead to harmful bias for zero-shot image classification, and explore how to combat these issues in demographic bias. We propose Diverse Demographic Data Generation (D3G), a training-free, zero-shot method of boosting classification accuracy while reducing demographic bias in pre-trained multimodal models. With this method, we utilize CLIP as our base multimodal model and Stable Diffusion XL as our generative model. We demonstrate that providing diverse demographic data at inference time improves performance for these models, and explore the impact of individual demographics on the resulting accuracy metric.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faD3G\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u751f\u6210\u591a\u6837\u5316\u4eba\u53e3\u7edf\u8ba1\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u63d0\u5347CLIP\u7b49\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u7c7b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u5e76\u51cf\u5c11\u4eba\u53e3\u7edf\u8ba1\u504f\u5dee\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u7c7b\u6a21\u578b\u9762\u4e34\u4e09\u4e2a\u4e3b\u8981\u95ee\u9898\uff1a1\uff09\u4f4e\u5bb9\u91cf\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u5206\u7c7b\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff1b2\uff09\u7f3a\u4e4f\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u7c7b\u522b\u8868\u793a\u6570\u636e\uff1b3\uff09\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4eba\u53e3\u7edf\u8ba1\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u5bfc\u81f4\u9884\u6d4b\u504f\u5411\u591a\u6570\u7c7b\u522b\uff0c\u9020\u6210\u6709\u5bb3\u504f\u5dee\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u95ee\u9898\u5728\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u7c7b\u4e2d\u5c24\u4e3a\u7a81\u51fa\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faD3G\uff08\u591a\u6837\u5316\u4eba\u53e3\u7edf\u8ba1\u6570\u636e\u751f\u6210\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u3001\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u4ee5CLIP\u4f5c\u4e3a\u57fa\u7840\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6a21\u578b\uff0cStable Diffusion XL\u4f5c\u4e3a\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u751f\u6210\u591a\u6837\u5316\u7684\u4eba\u53e3\u7edf\u8ba1\u6570\u636e\u6765\u63d0\u5347\u5206\u7c7b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u5e76\u51cf\u5c11\u504f\u5dee\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u63d0\u4f9b\u591a\u6837\u5316\u4eba\u53e3\u7edf\u8ba1\u6570\u636e\u80fd\u591f\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u63a2\u7d22\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u4eba\u53e3\u7edf\u8ba1\u7279\u5f81\u5bf9\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u6307\u6807\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "conclusion": "D3G\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u7c7b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u5e76\u51cf\u5c11\u4eba\u53e3\u7edf\u8ba1\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u4e3a\u7f13\u89e3\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u504f\u5dee\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u8bad\u7ec3\u514d\u8d39\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

To ensure atomic and consistent data access on DM, distributed transaction systems have been adapted, where compute nodes (CNs) rely on one-sided RDMA operations to access remote data in memory nodes (MNs). However, we observe that in existing transaction systems, the RDMA network interface cards at MNs become a primary performance bottleneck. This bottleneck arises from the high volume of one-sided atomic operations used for locks, which hinders the system's ability to scale efficiently.\n  To address this issue, this paper presents Lotus, a scalable distributed transaction system with lock disaggregation on DM. The key innovation of Lotus is to disaggregate locks from data and execute all locks on CNs, thus eliminating the bottleneck at MN RNICs. To achieve efficient lock management on CNs, Lotus employs an application-aware lock management mechanism that leverages the locality of the OLTP workloads to shard locks while maintaining load balance. To ensure consistent transaction processing with lock disaggregation, Lotus introduces a lock-first transaction protocol, which separates the locking phase as the first step in each read-write transaction execution. This protocol allows the system to determine the success of lock acquisitions early and proactively abort conflicting transactions, improving overall efficiency. To tolerate lock loss during CN failures, Lotus employs a lock-rebuild-free recovery mechanism that treats locks as ephemeral and avoids their reconstruction, ensuring lightweight recovery for CN failures. Experimental results demonstrate that Lotus improves transaction throughput by up to 2.1$\\times$ and reduces latency by up to 49.4% compared to state-of-the-art transaction systems on DM.", "AI": {"tldr": "Lotus\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5728\u5206\u89e3\u5185\u5b58\u67b6\u6784\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u9501\u5206\u89e3\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u4e8b\u52a1\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u9501\u7ba1\u7406\u4ece\u5185\u5b58\u8282\u70b9\u8f6c\u79fb\u5230\u8ba1\u7b97\u8282\u70b9\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86RDMA\u7f51\u5361\u74f6\u9888\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u4e8b\u52a1\u5904\u7406\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5206\u89e3\u5185\u5b58\u67b6\u6784\u4e0a\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u4e8b\u52a1\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\uff0c\u5185\u5b58\u8282\u70b9\u7684RDMA\u7f51\u5361\u56e0\u5904\u7406\u5927\u91cf\u5355\u5411\u539f\u5b50\u9501\u64cd\u4f5c\u800c\u6210\u4e3a\u6027\u80fd\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3002", "method": "1) \u9501\u5206\u89e3\uff1a\u5c06\u9501\u4ece\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u5206\u79bb\uff0c\u6240\u6709\u9501\u64cd\u4f5c\u5728\u8ba1\u7b97\u8282\u70b9\u6267\u884c\uff1b2) \u5e94\u7528\u611f\u77e5\u9501\u7ba1\u7406\uff1a\u5229\u7528OLTP\u5de5\u4f5c\u8d1f\u8f7d\u7684\u5c40\u90e8\u6027\u8fdb\u884c\u9501\u5206\u7247\u5e76\u4fdd\u6301\u8d1f\u8f7d\u5747\u8861\uff1b3) \u9501\u4f18\u5148\u4e8b\u52a1\u534f\u8bae\uff1a\u5c06\u9501\u5b9a\u9636\u6bb5\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8bfb\u5199\u4e8b\u52a1\u6267\u884c\u7684\u7b2c\u4e00\u6b65\uff0c\u65e9\u671f\u68c0\u6d4b\u51b2\u7a81\u5e76\u4e3b\u52a8\u4e2d\u6b62\uff1b4) \u65e0\u9501\u91cd\u5efa\u6062\u590d\u673a\u5236\uff1a\u5c06\u9501\u89c6\u4e3a\u4e34\u65f6\u72b6\u6001\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u5728\u8ba1\u7b97\u8282\u70b9\u6545\u969c\u65f6\u91cd\u5efa\u9501\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u4e0e\u73b0\u6709\u5206\u89e3\u5185\u5b58\u67b6\u6784\u4e0a\u7684\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u4e8b\u52a1\u7cfb\u7edf\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0cLotus\u5c06\u4e8b\u52a1\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u63d0\u5347\u6700\u9ad8\u8fbe2.1\u500d\uff0c\u5ef6\u8fdf\u964d\u4f4e\u6700\u9ad8\u8fbe49.4%\u3002", "conclusion": "Lotus\u901a\u8fc7\u9501\u5206\u89e3\u548c\u521b\u65b0\u7684\u9501\u7ba1\u7406\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u5206\u89e3\u5185\u5b58\u67b6\u6784\u4e2dRDMA\u7f51\u5361\u7684\u74f6\u9888\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u4e8b\u52a1\u5904\u7406\u3002"}}

Training a machine-learned model for VSR typically requires vast amounts of annotated images. Yet, species-level annotation demands domain expertise, making it realistic for domain experts to annotate only a few examples. These limited labeled data motivate training an ''expert'' model via few-shot learning (FSL). Meanwhile, advanced Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have demonstrated prominent performance on general recognition tasks. It is straightforward to ask whether LMMs excel in the highly specialized VSR task and whether they outshine FSL expert models. Somewhat surprisingly, we find that LMMs struggle in this task, despite using various established prompting techniques. LMMs even significantly underperform FSL expert models, which are as simple as finetuning a pretrained visual encoder on the few-shot images. However, our in-depth analysis reveals that LMMs can effectively post-hoc correct the expert models' incorrect predictions. Briefly, given a test image, when prompted with the top predictions from an FSL expert model, LMMs can recover the ground-truth label. Building on this insight, we derive a simple method called Post-hoc Correction (POC), which prompts an LMM to re-rank the expert model's top predictions using enriched prompts that include softmax confidence scores and few-shot visual examples. Across five challenging VSR benchmarks, POC outperforms prior art of FSL by +6.4% in accuracy without extra training, validation, or manual intervention. Importantly, POC generalizes to different pretrained backbones and LMMs, serving as a plug-and-play module to significantly enhance existing FSL methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faPOC\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a\u5229\u7528LMMs\u5bf9FSL\u4e13\u5bb6\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u8fdb\u884c\u540e\u9a8c\u6821\u6b63\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u91cd\u6392\u5e8f\u63d0\u5347\u89c6\u89c9\u7269\u79cd\u8bc6\u522b\u6027\u80fd", "motivation": "\u89c6\u89c9\u7269\u79cd\u8bc6\u522b\u9700\u8981\u5927\u91cf\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u4f46\u7269\u79cd\u7ea7\u6807\u6ce8\u9700\u8981\u9886\u57df\u4e13\u5bb6\uff0c\u901a\u5e38\u53ea\u80fd\u83b7\u5f97\u5c11\u91cf\u6807\u6ce8\u6837\u672c\u3002\u867d\u7136FSL\u4e13\u5bb6\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5c11\u91cf\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u4f46LMMs\u5728\u901a\u7528\u8bc6\u522b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u4f5c\u8005\u60f3\u63a2\u7a76LMMs\u5728\u4e13\u4e1aVSR\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u4ee5\u53ca\u662f\u5426\u4f18\u4e8eFSL\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faPOC\uff08Post-hoc Correction\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a1\uff09\u5148\u7528FSL\u4e13\u5bb6\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u6d4b\u8bd5\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210top\u9884\u6d4b\uff1b2\uff09\u7528LMMs\u5bf9\u4e13\u5bb6\u6a21\u578b\u7684top\u9884\u6d4b\u8fdb\u884c\u91cd\u6392\u5e8f\uff0c\u63d0\u793a\u5305\u542bsoftmax\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u5206\u6570\u548c\u5c11\u91cf\u89c6\u89c9\u793a\u4f8b\uff1b3\uff09\u65e0\u9700\u989d\u5916\u8bad\u7ec3\u3001\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6216\u4eba\u5de5\u5e72\u9884", "result": "\u5728\u4e94\u4e2a\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\u7684VSR\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cPOC\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709FSL\u65b9\u6cd5\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u63d0\u5347+6.4%\uff0c\u4e14\u80fd\u63a8\u5e7f\u5230\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u9aa8\u5e72\u7f51\u7edc\u548cLMMs\uff0c\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5373\u63d2\u5373\u7528\u6a21\u5757\u663e\u8457\u589e\u5f3a\u73b0\u6709FSL\u65b9\u6cd5", "conclusion": "LMMs\u867d\u7136\u76f4\u63a5\u5728VSR\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u4f46\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u6821\u6b63FSL\u4e13\u5bb6\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9519\u8bef\u9884\u6d4b\u3002POC\u65b9\u6cd5\u7b80\u5355\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408FSL\u4e13\u5bb6\u6a21\u578b\u548cLMMs\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u89c6\u89c9\u7269\u79cd\u8bc6\u522b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

Building on DM, memory-disaggregated key-value (KV) stores are adopted to efficiently manage remote data. Unfortunately, existing approaches suffer from poor performance due to two critical issues: 1) the overdependence on one-sided atomic operations in index processing, and 2) the constrained efficiency in compute-side caches. To address these issues, we propose FlexKV, a memory-disaggregated KV store with index proxying. Our key idea is to dynamically offload the index to compute nodes, leveraging their powerful CPUs to accelerate index processing and maintain high-performance compute-side caches. Three challenges have to be addressed to enable efficient index proxying on DM, i.e., the load imbalance across compute nodes, the limited memory of compute nodes, and the expensive cache coherence overhead. FlexKV proposes: 1) a rank-aware hotness detection algorithm to continuously balance index load across compute nodes, 2) a two-level CN memory optimization scheme to efficiently utilize compute node memory, and 3) an RPC-aggregated cache management mechanism to reduce cache coherence overhead. The experimental results show that FlexKV improves throughput by up to 2.94$\\times$ and reduces latency by up to 85.2%, compared with the state-of-the-art memory-disaggregated KV stores.", "AI": {"tldr": "FlexKV \u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u5185\u5b58\u89e3\u8026\u7684\u952e\u503c\u5b58\u50a8\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7d22\u5f15\u4ee3\u7406\u6280\u672f\u5c06\u7d22\u5f15\u52a8\u6001\u5378\u8f7d\u5230\u8ba1\u7b97\u8282\u70b9\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u7cfb\u7edf\u5bf9\u5355\u8fb9\u539f\u5b50\u64cd\u4f5c\u7684\u8fc7\u5ea6\u4f9d\u8d56\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u4fa7\u7f13\u5b58\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u4e0b\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u8fbe2.94\u500d\u7684\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u63d0\u5347\u548c85.2%\u7684\u5ef6\u8fdf\u964d\u4f4e\u3002", "motivation": "\u5185\u5b58\u89e3\u8026\u67b6\u6784\u5c06CPU\u548c\u5185\u5b58\u89e3\u8026\u4e3a\u72ec\u7acb\u8d44\u6e90\u6c60\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u5229\u7528\u7387\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u5185\u5b58\u89e3\u8026\u952e\u503c\u5b58\u50a8\u7cfb\u7edf\u5b58\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u95ee\u9898\uff1a1) \u7d22\u5f15\u5904\u7406\u8fc7\u5ea6\u4f9d\u8d56\u5355\u8fb9\u539f\u5b50\u64cd\u4f5c\uff1b2) \u8ba1\u7b97\u4fa7\u7f13\u5b58\u6548\u7387\u53d7\u9650\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u95ee\u9898\u5bfc\u81f4\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u80fd\u4e0d\u4f73\u3002", "method": "FlexKV \u63d0\u51fa\u7d22\u5f15\u4ee3\u7406\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5c06\u7d22\u5f15\u52a8\u6001\u5378\u8f7d\u5230\u8ba1\u7b97\u8282\u70b9\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5176\u5f3a\u5927\u7684CPU\u52a0\u901f\u7d22\u5f15\u5904\u7406\u3002\u5177\u4f53\u89e3\u51b3\u4e09\u4e2a\u6311\u6218\uff1a1) \u57fa\u4e8e\u7b49\u7ea7\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u70ed\u5ea6\u68c0\u6d4b\u7b97\u6cd5\u5e73\u8861\u8ba1\u7b97\u8282\u70b9\u95f4\u7684\u7d22\u5f15\u8d1f\u8f7d\uff1b2) \u4e24\u7ea7\u8ba1\u7b97\u8282\u70b9\u5185\u5b58\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6848\u9ad8\u6548\u5229\u7528\u5185\u5b58\uff1b3) RPC\u805a\u5408\u7684\u7f13\u5b58\u7ba1\u7406\u673a\u5236\u964d\u4f4e\u7f13\u5b58\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u5f00\u9500\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u4e0e\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u5185\u5b58\u89e3\u8026\u952e\u503c\u5b58\u50a8\u7cfb\u7edf\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0cFlexKV \u5c06\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u63d0\u5347\u9ad8\u8fbe2.94\u500d\uff0c\u5ef6\u8fdf\u964d\u4f4e\u9ad8\u8fbe85.2%\u3002", "conclusion": "FlexKV \u901a\u8fc7\u7d22\u5f15\u4ee3\u7406\u6280\u672f\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u5185\u5b58\u89e3\u8026\u952e\u503c\u5b58\u50a8\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e3a\u5185\u5b58\u89e3\u8026\u67b6\u6784\u4e0b\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u6570\u636e\u7ba1\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u601d\u8def\u3002"}}

The machine learning literature provides ample analysis with respect to the mechanisms to which linearity is induced. However, the analysis of extrapolation at the origin under the NTK regime remains a more unexplored special case. In particular, the infinite-dimensional feature map induced by the neural tangent kernel is not translationally invariant. This means that the study of an out-of-distribution evaluation point very far from the origin is not equivalent to the evaluation of a point very near the origin. And since the feature map is rotation invariant, these two special cases may represent the most canonically extreme bounds of ReLU NTK extrapolation.

One of the critical challenges is the continuous emergence of new applications, which generates Out-of-Distribution (OOD) traffic patterns that deviate from known categories and are not well represented by predefined models. Current approaches rely on predefined categories, which limits their effectiveness in handling unknown traffic types. Although some methods mitigate this limitation by simply classifying unknown traffic into a single \"Other\" category, they fail to make a fine-grained classification. In this paper, we propose a Two-stage Adaptive OOD classification Network (TAO-Net) that achieves accurate classification for both In-Distribution (ID) and OOD encrypted traffic. The method incorporates an innovative two-stage design: the first stage employs a hybrid OOD detection mechanism that integrates transformer-based inter-layer transformation smoothness and feature analysis to effectively distinguish between ID and OOD traffic, while the second stage leverages large language models with a novel semantic-enhanced prompt strategy to transform OOD traffic classification into a generation task, enabling flexible fine-grained classification without relying on predefined labels. Experiments on three datasets demonstrate that TAO-Net achieves 96.81-97.70% macro-precision and 96.77-97.68% macro-F1, outperforming previous methods that only reach 44.73-86.30% macro-precision, particularly in identifying emerging network applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faTAO-Net\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u81ea\u9002\u5e94OOD\u5206\u7c7b\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u52a0\u5bc6\u6d41\u91cf\u5206\u7c7b\uff0c\u80fd\u540c\u65f6\u5904\u7406\u5df2\u77e5\u548c\u672a\u77e5\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6df7\u5408OOD\u68c0\u6d4b\u548cLLM\u8bed\u4e49\u589e\u5f3a\u63d0\u793a\u5b9e\u73b0\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u5206\u7c7b\u3002", "motivation": "\u52a0\u5bc6\u6d41\u91cf\u5206\u7c7b\u9762\u4e34\u65b0\u5e94\u7528\u4e0d\u65ad\u6d8c\u73b0\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u4ea7\u751f\u8d85\u51fa\u5df2\u77e5\u5206\u5e03\u7684OOD\u6d41\u91cf\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u9884\u5b9a\u4e49\u7c7b\u522b\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u5904\u7406\u672a\u77e5\u6d41\u91cf\u7c7b\u578b\uff0c\u6216\u5c06\u672a\u77e5\u6d41\u91cf\u7b80\u5355\u5f52\u4e3a\"\u5176\u4ed6\"\u7c7b\u522b\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u5206\u7c7b\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u81ea\u9002\u5e94OOD\u5206\u7c7b\u7f51\u7edc(TAO-Net)\uff1a\u7b2c\u4e00\u9636\u6bb5\u91c7\u7528\u6df7\u5408OOD\u68c0\u6d4b\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u57fa\u4e8etransformer\u7684\u5c42\u95f4\u53d8\u6362\u5e73\u6ed1\u5ea6\u548c\u7279\u5f81\u5206\u6790\u6765\u533a\u5206ID\u548cOOD\u6d41\u91cf\uff1b\u7b2c\u4e8c\u9636\u6bb5\u5229\u7528\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u589e\u5f3a\u63d0\u793a\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5c06OOD\u6d41\u91cf\u5206\u7c7b\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u65e0\u9700\u9884\u5b9a\u4e49\u6807\u7b7e\u7684\u7075\u6d3b\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u5206\u7c7b\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cTAO-Net\u8fbe\u523096.81-97.70%\u7684\u5b8f\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c96.77-97.68%\u7684\u5b8fF1\u5206\u6570\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u5148\u524d\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u4ec544.73-86.30%\u5b8f\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff09\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u8bc6\u522b\u65b0\u5174\u7f51\u7edc\u5e94\u7528\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u3002", "conclusion": "TAO-Net\u901a\u8fc7\u521b\u65b0\u7684\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u52a0\u5bc6\u6d41\u91cf\u5206\u7c7b\u4e2dOOD\u6d41\u91cf\u5904\u7406\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5bf9\u5df2\u77e5\u548c\u672a\u77e5\u5e94\u7528\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u5206\u7c7b\uff0c\u4e3a\u52a8\u6001\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u7f51\u7edc\u73af\u5883\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

More precisely, the problem considers two key decisions: (i) whether to deploy additional edge servers or upgrade those already installed, and (ii) how tasks should be offloaded so that the average number of tasks that meet their delay requirement is maximized. The framework specifically involves: (i) deployment of new servers combined with capacity upgrades for existing servers, and (ii) the optimal task offloading to maximize the average number of tasks with a delay requirement. It also considers the following constraints: (i) budget per stage, (ii) server deployment and upgrade cost (in $) and cost depreciation rate, (iii) computation resource of servers, (iv) number of tasks and their growth rate (in %), and (v) the increase in task sizes and stricter delay requirements over time. We present two solutions: a Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) model and an efficient heuristic algorithm (M-ESU/H). MILP yields the optimal solution for small networks, whereas M-ESU/H is used in large-scale networks. For small networks, the simulation results show that the solution computed by M-ESU/H is within 1.25% of the optimal solution while running several orders of magnitude faster. For large networks, M-ESU/H is compared against three alternative heuristic solutions that consider only server deployment, or giving priority to server deployment or upgrade. Our experiments show that M-ESU/H yields up to 21.57% improvement in task satisfaction under identical budget and demand growth conditions, confirming its scalability and practical value for long-term MEC systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u591a\u9636\u6bb5\u8fb9\u7f18\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u5347\u7ea7\uff08M-ESU\uff09\u89c4\u5212\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6df7\u5408\u6574\u6570\u7ebf\u6027\u89c4\u5212\u548c\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u7b97\u6cd5\u89e3\u51b3\u8fb9\u7f18\u8ba1\u7b97\u7cfb\u7edf\u957f\u671f\u5347\u7ea7\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709MEC\u7cfb\u7edf\u9700\u8981\u957f\u671f\u5347\u7ea7\u4ee5\u9002\u5e94\u4efb\u52a1\u589e\u957f\u548c\u5ef6\u8fdf\u8981\u6c42\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u8003\u8651\u591a\u9636\u6bb5\u9884\u7b97\u7ea6\u675f\u548c\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u5347\u7ea7/\u90e8\u7f72\u8054\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u89c4\u5212\u6846\u67b6", "method": "\u63d0\u51faM-ESU\u95ee\u9898\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u90e8\u7f72/\u5347\u7ea7\u51b3\u7b56\u548c\u4efb\u52a1\u5378\u8f7d\u4f18\u5316\uff1b\u5f00\u53d1MILP\u7cbe\u786e\u7b97\u6cd5\u7528\u4e8e\u5c0f\u89c4\u6a21\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u4ee5\u53caM-ESU/H\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u7b97\u6cd5\u7528\u4e8e\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u7f51\u7edc", "result": "\u5c0f\u89c4\u6a21\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2dM-ESU/H\u7b97\u6cd5\u89e3\u4e0e\u6700\u4f18\u89e3\u5dee\u8ddd\u57281.25%\u5185\u4e14\u8fd0\u884c\u901f\u5ea6\u5feb\u51e0\u4e2a\u6570\u91cf\u7ea7\uff1b\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u76f8\u6bd4\u5176\u4ed6\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u7b97\u6cd5\u4efb\u52a1\u6ee1\u8db3\u7387\u63d0\u5347\u8fbe21.57%", "conclusion": "M-ESU\u6846\u67b6\u548cM-ESU/H\u7b97\u6cd5\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3MEC\u7cfb\u7edf\u957f\u671f\u89c4\u5212\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u9884\u7b97\u548c\u9700\u6c42\u589e\u957f\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4efb\u52a1\u6ee1\u8db3\u7387\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4ef7\u503c"}}

Traditional deterministic, metaheuristic, and machine-learning-assisted methods search within fixed, human-defined configuration spaces, limiting their ability to discover fundamentally new design topologies. Here we introduce ReactorFold, a generative framework that reformulates fuel-assembly design as a sequence modeling problem for language models. Using Monte Carlo data, parameter-efficient fine-tuning, and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), the model learns the latent structure of a pressurized-water-reactor assembly and generates candidate layouts in a single forward pass. Notably, the DPO-aligned model exhibits emergent design-space expansion: despite being trained exclusively on configurations with a fixed number of gadolinium burnable absorber (Gd) rods, it autonomously adjusts Gd inventory to satisfy strict power-peaking constraints. The model also discovers high-performing asymmetric configurations that challenge conventional symmetric loading heuristics, accessing design regimes inaccessible to conventional search methods and demonstrating that language models can internalize causal physical relationships and transcend human-imposed design constraints.", "AI": {"tldr": "ReactorFold\uff1a\u5c06\u6838\u53cd\u5e94\u5806\u71c3\u6599\u7ec4\u4ef6\u8bbe\u8ba1\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u5e8f\u5217\u5efa\u6a21\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u5019\u9009\u5e03\u5c40\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u81ea\u4e3b\u8c03\u6574\u8bbe\u8ba1\u53c2\u6570\u5e76\u53d1\u73b0\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u65e0\u6cd5\u627e\u5230\u7684\u975e\u5bf9\u79f0\u914d\u7f6e\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u6838\u53cd\u5e94\u5806\u5806\u82af\u8bbe\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u3001\u5143\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u3001\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u8f85\u52a9\uff09\u5728\u56fa\u5b9a\u7684\u4eba\u5de5\u5b9a\u4e49\u914d\u7f6e\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u641c\u7d22\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u53d1\u73b0\u5168\u65b0\u8bbe\u8ba1\u62d3\u6251\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u591f\u8d85\u8d8a\u4eba\u4e3a\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7ea6\u675f\u3001\u53d1\u73b0\u6839\u672c\u6027\u65b0\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "ReactorFold\u6846\u67b6\u5c06\u71c3\u6599\u7ec4\u4ef6\u8bbe\u8ba1\u91cd\u65b0\u8868\u8ff0\u4e3a\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5e8f\u5217\u5efa\u6a21\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u4f7f\u7528\u8499\u7279\u5361\u6d1b\u6570\u636e\u3001\u53c2\u6570\u9ad8\u6548\u5fae\u8c03\u548c\u76f4\u63a5\u504f\u597d\u4f18\u5316\uff08DPO\uff09\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5b66\u4e60\u538b\u6c34\u5806\u7ec4\u4ef6\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5355\u6b21\u524d\u5411\u4f20\u9012\u751f\u6210\u5019\u9009\u5e03\u5c40\u3002", "result": "DPO\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7a7a\u95f4\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u6d8c\u73b0\u80fd\u529b\uff1a\u5c3d\u7ba1\u4ec5\u5728\u56fa\u5b9a\u6570\u91cf\u9486\u53ef\u71c3\u5438\u6536\u4f53\uff08Gd\uff09\u68d2\u7684\u914d\u7f6e\u4e0a\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u5374\u80fd\u81ea\u4e3b\u8c03\u6574Gd\u5e93\u5b58\u4ee5\u6ee1\u8db3\u4e25\u683c\u7684\u529f\u7387\u5cf0\u503c\u7ea6\u675f\u3002\u6a21\u578b\u8fd8\u53d1\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u975e\u5bf9\u79f0\u914d\u7f6e\uff0c\u6311\u6218\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u5bf9\u79f0\u88c5\u8f7d\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u591f\u5185\u5316\u56e0\u679c\u7269\u7406\u5173\u7cfb\u5e76\u8d85\u8d8a\u4eba\u4e3a\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u8bbf\u95ee\u4f20\u7edf\u641c\u7d22\u65b9\u6cd5\u65e0\u6cd5\u8fbe\u5230\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u4e3a\u6838\u53cd\u5e94\u5806\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5f00\u8f9f\u4e86\u65b0\u9014\u5f84\u3002"}}

We propose Kascade, a training-free sparse attention method that leverages known observations such as 1) post-softmax attention is intrinsically sparse, and 2) the identity of high-weight keys is stable across nearby layers. Kascade computes exact Top-k indices in a small set of anchor layers, then reuses those indices in intermediate reuse layers. The anchor layers are selected algorithmically, via a dynamic-programming objective that maximizes cross-layer similarity over a development set, allowing easy deployment across models. The method incorporates efficient implementation constraints (e.g. tile-level operations), across both prefill and decode attention. The Top-k selection and reuse in Kascade is head-aware and we show in our experiments that this is critical for high accuracy. Kascade achieves up to 4.1x speedup in decode attention and 2.2x speedup in prefill attention over FlashAttention-3 baseline on H100 GPUs while closely matching dense attention accuracy on long-context benchmarks such as LongBench and AIME-24.", "AI": {"tldr": "Kascade\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u7a00\u758f\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u951a\u70b9\u5c42\u8ba1\u7b97Top-k\u7d22\u5f15\u5e76\u5728\u4e2d\u95f4\u5c42\u91cd\u7528\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u52a0\u901f\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587LLM\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u5728H100 GPU\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u6700\u9ad84.1\u500d\u89e3\u7801\u52a0\u901f\u548c2.2\u500d\u9884\u586b\u5145\u52a0\u901f\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u63a5\u8fd1\u5bc6\u96c6\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u7684\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u662f\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587LLM\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u5ef6\u8fdf\u6765\u6e90\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u548cRAG\u7b49\u65e5\u76ca\u6d41\u884c\u7684\u5de5\u4f5c\u8d1f\u8f7d\u4e2d\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u9700\u8981\u89e3\u51b3\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u74f6\u9888\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "Kascade\u5229\u7528\u4e24\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u89c2\u5bdf\uff1a1\uff09softmax\u540e\u7684\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u672c\u8d28\u4e0a\u662f\u7a00\u758f\u7684\uff1b2\uff09\u9ad8\u6743\u91cd\u952e\u7684\u6807\u8bc6\u5728\u76f8\u90bb\u5c42\u95f4\u662f\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u3002\u65b9\u6cd5\u5305\u62ec\uff1a\u5728\u951a\u70b9\u5c42\u8ba1\u7b97\u7cbe\u786e\u7684Top-k\u7d22\u5f15\uff0c\u5728\u4e2d\u95f4\u91cd\u7528\u5c42\u590d\u7528\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7d22\u5f15\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u89c4\u5212\u7b97\u6cd5\u9009\u62e9\u951a\u70b9\u5c42\u4ee5\u6700\u5927\u5316\u8de8\u5c42\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\uff1b\u5b9e\u73b0\u5934\u611f\u77e5\u7684Top-k\u9009\u62e9\u548c\u91cd\u7528\uff1b\u652f\u6301\u9884\u586b\u5145\u548c\u89e3\u7801\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u5b9e\u73b0\u3002", "result": "\u5728H100 GPU\u4e0a\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4FlashAttention-3\u57fa\u51c6\uff0cKascade\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6700\u9ad84.1\u500d\u7684\u89e3\u7801\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u52a0\u901f\u548c2.2\u500d\u7684\u9884\u586b\u5145\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u52a0\u901f\u3002\u5728LongBench\u548cAIME-24\u7b49\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0e\u5bc6\u96c6\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u975e\u5e38\u63a5\u8fd1\u3002", "conclusion": "Kascade\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u65e0\u5173\u7a00\u758f\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5229\u7528\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u7a00\u758f\u6027\u548c\u8de8\u5c42\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u52a0\u901f\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587LLM\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u6613\u4e8e\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u90e8\u7f72\u3002"}}

Various multi-view support vector machine (MvSVM) approaches have been developed, demonstrating significant success. Moreover, these models face challenges in effectively capturing decision boundaries in high-dimensional spaces using the kernel trick. They are also prone to errors and struggle with view inconsistencies, which are common in multi-view datasets. In this work, we introduce the multiview twin restricted kernel machine (TMvRKM), a novel model that integrates the strengths of kernel machines with the multiview framework, addressing key computational and generalization challenges associated with traditional kernel-based approaches. Unlike traditional methods that rely on solving large quadratic programming problems (QPPs), the proposed TMvRKM efficiently determines an optimal separating hyperplane through a regularized least squares approach, enhancing both computational efficiency and classification performance. The primal objective of TMvRKM includes a coupling term designed to balance errors across multiple views effectively. By integrating early and late fusion strategies, TMvRKM leverages the collective information from all views during training while remaining flexible to variations specific to individual views. The proposed TMvRKM model is rigorously tested on UCI, KEEL, and AwA benchmark datasets.

Attempts to expand sampling across hospitals, institutions, or countries with differing regulations face severe privacy, regulatory, and logistical obstacles that are often difficult to overcome. The Federated Learning (FL) provides a promising solution by enabling collaborative model training across decentralized datasets while keeping patient data local and private. Here, we report a novel global FL initiative using the Sherpa.ai FL platform, which leverages FL across distributed datasets in two international organizations for the diagnosis of COL6-RD, using collagen VI immunofluorescence microscopy images from patient-derived fibroblast cultures. Our solution resulted in an ML model capable of classifying collagen VI patient images into the three primary pathogenic mechanism groups associated with COL6-RD: exon skipping, glycine substitution, and pseudoexon insertion. This new approach achieved an F1-score of 0.82, outperforming single-organization models (0.57-0.75).

The main focus of this dissertation is on creating and testing an intelligent production system for XRIT that solves important problems like energy management, predictive maintenance, and AI-powered decision support. Machine learning models are built into the system, such as the Random Forest Classifier for proactive maintenance and the Isolation Forest for finding outliers. These models help with decision-making and reducing downtime. Streamlit makes real-time data visualisation possible, giving workers access to dashboards that they can interact with and see real-time observations.The system was tested with fake data and is made to be scalable, so it can be used in real time in XRIT's production setting. Adding an AI-powered virtual assistant made with GPT-4 lets workers get real-time, useful information that makes complicated questions easier to answer and improves operational decisions. The testing shows that the system makes working efficiency, energy management, and the ability to plan repairs much better. Moving the system to real-time data merging and looking for other ways to make it better will be the main focus of future work.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5f00\u53d1\u667a\u80fd\u751f\u4ea7\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u96c6\u6210\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u548cAI\u52a9\u624b\uff0c\u63d0\u5347XRIT\u751f\u4ea7\u8fd0\u8425\u6548\u7387", "motivation": "\u5de5\u4e1a4.0\u5feb\u901f\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u89e3\u51b3\u667a\u80fd\u751f\u4ea7\u4e2d\u7684\u80fd\u6e90\u7ba1\u7406\u3001\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u7ef4\u62a4\u548cAI\u51b3\u7b56\u652f\u6301\u7b49\u5173\u952e\u95ee\u9898", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u667a\u80fd\u751f\u4ea7\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u96c6\u6210\u968f\u673a\u68ee\u6797\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u8fdb\u884c\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u7ef4\u62a4\uff0c\u9694\u79bb\u68ee\u6797\u68c0\u6d4b\u5f02\u5e38\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528Streamlit\u5b9e\u73b0\u5b9e\u65f6\u6570\u636e\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\uff0c\u5e76\u96c6\u6210GPT-4\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u865a\u62df\u52a9\u624b", "result": "\u7cfb\u7edf\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u62df\u6570\u636e\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u5de5\u4f5c\u6548\u7387\u3001\u80fd\u6e90\u7ba1\u7406\u548c\u7ef4\u4fee\u89c4\u5212\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5177\u5907\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027", "conclusion": "\u7cfb\u7edf\u6210\u529f\u89e3\u51b3\u5173\u952e\u751f\u4ea7\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u672a\u6765\u5de5\u4f5c\u5c06\u805a\u7126\u5b9e\u65f6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u6210\u548c\u7cfb\u7edf\u4f18\u5316"}}

Existing solutions employ algorithmic modifications treating all client updates identically, ignoring semantic validity. We introduce Semantic-Constrained Federated Aggregation (SCFA), a theoretically-grounded framework incorporating domain knowledge constraints into distributed optimization. We prove SCFA achieves convergence rate O(1/sqrt(T) + rho) where rho represents constraint violation rate, establishing the first convergence theory for constraint-based federated learning. Our analysis shows constraints reduce effective data heterogeneity by 41% and improve privacy-utility tradeoffs through hypothesis space reduction by factor theta=0.37. Under (epsilon,delta)-differential privacy with epsilon=10, constraint regularization maintains utility within 3.7% of non-private baseline versus 12.1% degradation for standard federated learning, representing 2.7x improvement. We validate our framework on manufacturing predictive maintenance using Bosch production data with 1.18 million samples and 968 sensor features, constructing knowledge graphs encoding 3,000 constraints from ISA-95 and MASON ontologies. Experiments demonstrate 22% faster convergence, 41.3% model divergence reduction, and constraint violation thresholds where rho<0.05 maintains 90% optimal performance while rho>0.18 causes catastrophic failure.

This tutorial introduces the method, explaining how it transforms experimental data into compact physical laws that reveal compact dimensional invariance between variables. The approach combines classical dimensional analysis with modern machine learning techniques. Starting from measurements of physical quantities, the method identifies the fundamental ways to combine variables into dimensionless groups, then uses neural networks to discover which combinations best predict the experimental output. A key innovation is a regularization technique that encourages the learned coefficients to take simple, interpretable values like integers or half-integers, making the discovered laws both accurate and physically meaningful. We systematically investigate how measurement noise and discrete sampling affect the discovery process, demonstrating that the regularization approach provides robustness to experimental uncertainties. The method successfully handles cases with single or multiple dimensionless numbers, revealing how different but equivalent representations can capture the same underlying physics. Despite recent progress, key challenges remain, including managing the computational cost of identifying multiple dimensionless groups, understanding the influence of data characteristics, automating the selection of relevant input variables, and developing user-friendly tools for experimentalists.

This limitation reflects an incomplete understanding of how specific flow features contribute to thrombus initiation and growth. This study introduces an interpretable machine learning framework for spatial thrombosis assessment based directly on computational fluid dynamics-derived flow features. A logistic regression (LR) model combined with a structured feature-selection pipeline is used to derive a compact and physically interpretable feature set, including nonlinear feature combinations. The framework is trained using spatial risk patterns from a validated, macro-scale thrombosis model for two representative scenarios. The model reproduces the labeled risk distributions and identifies distinct sets of flow features associated with increased thrombosis risk. When applied to a centrifugal pump, despite training on a single axial pump operating point, the model predicts plausible thrombosis-prone regions. These results show that interpretable machine learning can link local flow features to thrombosis risk while remaining computationally efficient and mechanistically transparent. The low computational cost enables rapid thrombogenicity screening without repeated or costly simulations. The proposed framework complements physics-based thrombosis modeling and provides a methodological basis for integrating interpretable machine learning into CFD-driven thrombosis analysis and device design workflows.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8eCFD\u6d41\u573a\u7279\u5f81\u8fdb\u884c\u7a7a\u95f4\u8840\u6813\u98ce\u9669\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u6a21\u578b\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u900f\u660e", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u8840\u6813\u8ba1\u7b97\u6a21\u578b\u96be\u4ee5\u5c06\u590d\u6742\u6d41\u52a8\u6761\u4ef6\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u53ef\u9760\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u98ce\u9669\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u5bf9\u7279\u5b9a\u6d41\u52a8\u7279\u5f81\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u8840\u6813\u5f62\u6210\u7406\u89e3\u4e0d\u8db3", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u903b\u8f91\u56de\u5f52\u6a21\u578b\u7ed3\u5408\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u7279\u5f81\u9009\u62e9\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u4eceCFD\u6d41\u573a\u7279\u5f81\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6\u7d27\u51d1\u4e14\u7269\u7406\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u96c6\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u7279\u5f81\u7ec4\u5408", "result": "\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u590d\u73b0\u6807\u8bb0\u7684\u98ce\u9669\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u4e0e\u8840\u6813\u98ce\u9669\u589e\u52a0\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u6d41\u52a8\u7279\u5f81\u96c6\uff1b\u5728\u79bb\u5fc3\u6cf5\u4e0a\u5e94\u7528\u65f6\uff0c\u5c3d\u7ba1\u4ec5\u5728\u5355\u8f74\u6d41\u6cf5\u5de5\u51b5\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u4ecd\u80fd\u9884\u6d4b\u5408\u7406\u7684\u8840\u6813\u6613\u53d1\u533a\u57df", "conclusion": "\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u5173\u8054\u5c40\u90e8\u6d41\u52a8\u7279\u5f81\u4e0e\u8840\u6813\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u4f4e\uff0c\u4e3aCFD\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u8840\u6813\u5206\u6790\u548c\u8bbe\u5907\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b9\u6cd5\u57fa\u7840"}}

While test-time adaptation (TTA) offers a promising approach for personalized prediction, the rarity of IOH events often leads to unreliable test-time training. To address this, we propose CSA-TTA, a novel Cross-Sample Augmented Test-Time Adaptation framework that enhances training by incorporating hypotension events from other individuals. Specifically, we first construct a cross-sample bank by segmenting historical data into hypotensive and non-hypotensive samples. Then, we introduce a coarse-to-fine retrieval strategy for building test-time training data: we initially apply K-Shape clustering to identify representative cluster centers and subsequently retrieve the top-K semantically similar samples based on the current patient signal. Additionally, we integrate both self-supervised masked reconstruction and retrospective sequence forecasting signals during training to enhance model adaptability to rapid and subtle intraoperative dynamics. We evaluate the proposed CSA-TTA on both the VitalDB dataset and a real-world in-hospital dataset by integrating it with state-of-the-art time series forecasting models, including TimesFM and UniTS. CSA-TTA consistently enhances performance across settings-for instance, on VitalDB, it improves Recall and F1 scores by +1.33% and +1.13%, respectively, under fine-tuning, and by +7.46% and +5.07% in zero-shot scenarios-demonstrating strong robustness and generalization.", "AI": {"tldr": "CSA-TTA\uff1a\u4e00\u79cd\u8de8\u6837\u672c\u589e\u5f3a\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u9002\u5e94\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6574\u5408\u5176\u4ed6\u60a3\u8005\u7684\u4f4e\u8840\u538b\u4e8b\u4ef6\u6765\u6539\u5584\u672f\u4e2d\u4f4e\u8840\u538b\u7684\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4f4e\u8840\u538b\u4e8b\u4ef6\u7a00\u5c11\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0d\u53ef\u9760\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u672f\u4e2d\u4f4e\u8840\u538b\uff08IOH\uff09\u5177\u6709\u663e\u8457\u7684\u624b\u672f\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u4f46\u7531\u4e8e\u60a3\u8005\u7279\u5f02\u6027\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u51c6\u786e\u9884\u6d4b\u4ecd\u7136\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\u3002\u867d\u7136\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u9002\u5e94\uff08TTA\uff09\u4e3a\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u9884\u6d4b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u524d\u666f\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f46\u4f4e\u8840\u538b\u4e8b\u4ef6\u7684\u7a00\u5c11\u6027\u5e38\u5e38\u5bfc\u81f4\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0d\u53ef\u9760\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faCSA-TTA\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1\uff09\u6784\u5efa\u8de8\u6837\u672c\u5e93\uff0c\u5c06\u5386\u53f2\u6570\u636e\u5206\u5272\u4e3a\u4f4e\u8840\u538b\u548c\u975e\u4f4e\u8840\u538b\u6837\u672c\uff1b2\uff09\u91c7\u7528\u7c97\u5230\u7ec6\u7684\u68c0\u7d22\u7b56\u7565\uff1a\u5148\u7528K-Shape\u805a\u7c7b\u8bc6\u522b\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u805a\u7c7b\u4e2d\u5fc3\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f53\u524d\u60a3\u8005\u4fe1\u53f7\u68c0\u7d22\u524dK\u4e2a\u8bed\u4e49\u76f8\u4f3c\u6837\u672c\uff1b3\uff09\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u6574\u5408\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u63a9\u7801\u91cd\u5efa\u548c\u56de\u987e\u6027\u5e8f\u5217\u9884\u6d4b\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u5feb\u901f\u5fae\u5999\u672f\u4e2d\u52a8\u6001\u7684\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728VitalDB\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u533b\u9662\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u4e0eTimesFM\u548cUniTS\u7b49\u5148\u8fdb\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u96c6\u6210\u3002\u5728VitalDB\u4e0a\uff0c\u5fae\u8c03\u573a\u666f\u4e0bRecall\u548cF1\u5206\u6570\u5206\u522b\u63d0\u5347+1.33%\u548c+1.13%\uff1b\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u5206\u522b\u63d0\u5347+7.46%\u548c+5.07%\uff0c\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "CSA-TTA\u901a\u8fc7\u8de8\u6837\u672c\u589e\u5f3a\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u672f\u4e2d\u4f4e\u8840\u538b\u9884\u6d4b\u4e2d\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0d\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u7684\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u4e3a\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u533b\u7597\u9884\u6d4b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods such as LoRA reduce this cost by adding small low-rank updates to frozen model weights. However, these methods restrict the training to a limited subspace, which can sometimes reduce performance.\n  For Small Language Models (SLMs), where efficiency gains matter even more, we introduce AdaGradSelect, an adaptive method that selects which transformer blocks to update based on gradients.\n  Early observations showed that updating only the transformer blocks with the highest gradient norms can achieve performance close to full fine-tuning. Building on this insight, AdaGradSelect adaptively chooses which blocks to train. It uses a combination of Dirichlet-based sampling, which depends on how frequently blocks were updated in the past, and an epsilon-greedy exploration strategy. This lets the method explore different blocks in early training and gradually focus on the most important ones in later epochs.\n  Experiments show that AdaGradSelect trains about 12 percent faster and uses 35 percent less GPU memory while delivering performance very close to full fine-tuning.

While some training data is publicly available, substantial investment is required to generate proprietary datasets, such as human preference annotations or to curate new ones from existing sources. As larger datasets generally yield better model performance, two natural questions arise. First, how can data owners make informed decisions about curation strategies and data sources investment? Second, how can multiple data owners collaboratively pool their resources to train superior models while fairly distributing the benefits? This problem, data valuation, which is not specific to large language models, has been addressed by the machine learning community through the lens of cooperative game theory, with the Shapley value being the prevalent solution concept. However, computing Shapley values is notoriously expensive for data valuation, typically requiring numerous model retrainings, which can become prohibitive for large machine learning models. In this work, we demonstrate that this computational challenge is dramatically simplified for LLMs trained with Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). We show how the specific mathematical structure of DPO enables scalable Shapley value computation.

However, these models often exhibit discrepancies from the reality due to unmodeled effects or simplifying assumptions. We refer to this gap as the ignorance model. While purely data-driven approaches attempt to learn full system behavior, they require large amounts of high-quality data across the entire spatial and temporal domain. In real-world scenarios, such information is unavailable, making full data-driven modeling unreliable. To overcome this limitation, we model of the ignorance component using a hybrid twin approach, instead of simulating phenomena from scratch. Since physics-based models approximate the overall behavior of the phenomena, the remaining ignorance is typically lower in complexity than the full physical response, therefore, it can be learned with significantly fewer data. A key difficulty, however, is that spatial measurements are sparse, also obtaining data measuring the same phenomenon for different spatial configurations is challenging in practice. Our contribution is to overcome this limitation by using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to represent the ignorance model. GNNs learn the spatial pattern of the missing physics even when the number of measurement locations is limited. This allows us to enrich the physics-based model with data-driven corrections without requiring dense spatial, temporal and parametric data. To showcase the performance of the proposed method, we evaluate this GNN-based hybrid twin on nonlinear heat transfer problems across different meshes, geometries, and load positions. Results show that the GNN successfully captures the ignorance and generalizes corrections across spatial configurations, improving simulation accuracy and interpretability, while minimizing data requirements.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u56fe\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u5b6a\u751f\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u5c11\u91cf\u6570\u636e\u5b66\u4e60\u7269\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u672a\u77e5\u90e8\u5206\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u6a21\u62df\u7cbe\u5ea6", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u6709\u9650\u5143\u7b49\u7269\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u5b58\u5728\u672a\u5efa\u6a21\u6548\u5e94\u548c\u7b80\u5316\u5047\u8bbe\uff0c\u4e0e\u771f\u5b9e\u60c5\u51b5\u5b58\u5728\u5dee\u8ddd\uff1b\u7eaf\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u65b9\u6cd5\u9700\u8981\u5927\u91cf\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u96be\u4ee5\u83b7\u53d6", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u6df7\u5408\u5b6a\u751f\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u56fe\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u8868\u793a\u672a\u77e5\u6a21\u578b\u90e8\u5206\uff0c\u5229\u7528GNN\u5b66\u4e60\u7a7a\u95f4\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5728\u6d4b\u91cf\u70b9\u6709\u9650\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u6355\u6349\u7f3a\u5931\u7684\u7269\u7406\u4fe1\u606f", "result": "\u5728\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u70ed\u4f20\u5bfc\u95ee\u9898\u4e2d\uff0cGNN\u6210\u529f\u6355\u6349\u672a\u77e5\u90e8\u5206\uff0c\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u7f51\u683c\u3001\u51e0\u4f55\u5f62\u72b6\u548c\u8f7d\u8377\u4f4d\u7f6e\u4e0b\u90fd\u80fd\u6cdb\u5316\u4fee\u6b63\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u6a21\u62df\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027", "conclusion": "GNN\u6df7\u5408\u5b6a\u751f\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u7528\u5c11\u91cf\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u7269\u7406\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u514b\u670d\u7a7a\u95f4\u6d4b\u91cf\u7a00\u758f\u7684\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u6a21\u62df"}}

Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have emerged as an efficient alternative by embedding physics-based constraints into deep learning frameworks, but they face challenges in achieving high accuracy and handling complex boundary conditions. In this work, we extend the Time-Evolving Natural Gradient (TENG) framework to address Dirichlet boundary conditions, integrating natural gradient optimization with numerical time-stepping schemes, including Euler and Heun methods, to ensure both stability and accuracy. By incorporating boundary condition penalty terms into the loss function, the proposed approach enables precise enforcement of Dirichlet constraints. Experiments on the heat equation demonstrate the superior accuracy of the Heun method due to its second-order corrections and the computational efficiency of the Euler method for simpler scenarios. This work establishes a foundation for extending the framework to Neumann and mixed boundary conditions, as well as broader classes of PDEs, advancing the applicability of neural network-based solvers for real-world problems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5c06\u65f6\u95f4\u6f14\u5316\u81ea\u7136\u68af\u5ea6\uff08TENG\uff09\u6846\u67b6\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u5904\u7406\u72c4\u5229\u514b\u96f7\u8fb9\u754c\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u81ea\u7136\u68af\u5ea6\u4f18\u5316\u4e0e\u6570\u503c\u65f6\u95f4\u6b65\u8fdb\u65b9\u6848\uff08\u6b27\u62c9\u548cHeun\u65b9\u6cd5\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8fb9\u754c\u60e9\u7f5a\u9879\u7cbe\u786e\u5b9e\u65bd\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u5728\u70ed\u65b9\u7a0b\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u6570\u503c\u65b9\u6cd5\u5904\u7406\u9ad8\u7ef4\u6216\u590d\u6742PDE\u95ee\u9898\u56f0\u96be\uff0c\u7269\u7406\u4fe1\u606f\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\uff08PINNs\uff09\u867d\u80fd\u5d4c\u5165\u7269\u7406\u7ea6\u675f\u4f46\u9762\u4e34\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0d\u8db3\u548c\u590d\u6742\u8fb9\u754c\u6761\u4ef6\u5904\u7406\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u7a33\u5b9a\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u3002", "method": "\u6269\u5c55TENG\u6846\u67b6\u5904\u7406\u72c4\u5229\u514b\u96f7\u8fb9\u754c\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u81ea\u7136\u68af\u5ea6\u4f18\u5316\u4e0e\u6570\u503c\u65f6\u95f4\u6b65\u8fdb\u65b9\u6848\uff08\u6b27\u62c9\u548cHeun\u65b9\u6cd5\uff09\uff0c\u5728\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u4e2d\u52a0\u5165\u8fb9\u754c\u6761\u4ef6\u60e9\u7f5a\u9879\u6765\u7cbe\u786e\u5b9e\u65bd\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u70ed\u65b9\u7a0b\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0cHeun\u65b9\u6cd5\u56e0\u4e8c\u9636\u4fee\u6b63\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u6b27\u62c9\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u7b80\u5355\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u66f4\u9ad8\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u6846\u67b6\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4e3a\u6269\u5c55\u6846\u67b6\u5230\u8bfa\u4f0a\u66fc\u548c\u6df7\u5408\u8fb9\u754c\u6761\u4ef6\u4ee5\u53ca\u66f4\u5e7f\u6cdbPDE\u7c7b\u522b\u5960\u5b9a\u4e86\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u63a8\u8fdb\u4e86\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u95ee\u9898\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u3002"}}

The temporal complexity of embodied tasks demands a dynamic and adaptable computation mode. Static and lossy acceleration methods, such as quantization, fail to handle such dynamic embodied tasks, while speculative decoding offers a lossless and adaptive yet underexplored alternative for DP. However, it is non-trivial to address the following challenges: how to match the base model's denoising quality at lower cost under time-varying task difficulty in embodied settings, and how to dynamically and interactively adjust computation based on task difficulty in such environments. In this paper, we propose Temporal-aware Reinforcement-based Speculative Diffusion Policy (TS-DP), the first framework that enables speculative decoding for DP with temporal adaptivity. First, to handle dynamic environments where task difficulty varies over time, we distill a Transformer-based drafter to imitate the base model and replace its costly denoising calls. Second, an RL-based scheduler further adapts to time-varying task difficulty by adjusting speculative parameters to maintain accuracy while improving efficiency. Extensive experiments across diverse embodied environments demonstrate that TS-DP achieves up to 4.17 times faster inference with over 94% accepted drafts, reaching an inference frequency of 25 Hz and enabling real-time diffusion-based control without performance degradation.", "AI": {"tldr": "TS-DP\u901a\u8fc7\u63a8\u6d4b\u89e3\u7801\u548c\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u8c03\u5ea6\u5668\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u6269\u6563\u7b56\u7565\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u5c06\u63a8\u7406\u901f\u5ea6\u63d0\u53474.17\u500d\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b025Hz\u5b9e\u65f6\u63a7\u5236", "motivation": "\u6269\u6563\u7b56\u7565\u5728\u5177\u8eab\u63a7\u5236\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u4f46\u5b58\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u5ef6\u8fdf\u9ad8\u3001\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u5927\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u52a0\u901f\u65b9\u6cd5\u5982\u91cf\u5316\u65e0\u6cd5\u5904\u7406\u52a8\u6001\u7684\u5177\u8eab\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u800c\u63a8\u6d4b\u89e3\u7801\u867d\u7136\u65e0\u635f\u4e14\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u6269\u6563\u7b56\u7565\u4e2d\u5c1a\u672a\u5145\u5206\u63a2\u7d22\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faTS-DP\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1) \u4f7f\u7528Transformer-based drafter\u84b8\u998f\u57fa\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u66ff\u4ee3\u6602\u8d35\u7684\u53bb\u566a\u6b65\u9aa4\uff1b2) \u91c7\u7528RL-based scheduler\u6839\u636e\u4efb\u52a1\u96be\u5ea6\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u63a8\u6d4b\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u5e73\u8861\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u6548\u7387\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u5177\u8eab\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\uff0cTS-DP\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u8fbe4.17\u500d\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u52a0\u901f\uff0c\u8d85\u8fc794%\u7684\u8349\u7a3f\u88ab\u63a5\u53d7\uff0c\u63a8\u7406\u9891\u7387\u8fbe\u523025Hz\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u65e0\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u7684\u5b9e\u65f6\u6269\u6563\u63a7\u5236\u3002", "conclusion": "TS-DP\u9996\u6b21\u5c06\u63a8\u6d4b\u89e3\u7801\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u65f6\u95f4\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u673a\u5236\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u52a8\u6001\u5177\u8eab\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b9e\u65f6\u6269\u6563\u63a7\u5236\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

However, the Gaussian kernel's lack of data-dependence and computational overhead limit its scalability and effectiveness for categorical biological sequences. Recent work proposed the isolation kernel as an alternative, yet it may not optimally capture sequence similarities. In this study, we comprehensively evaluate nine different kernel functions for t-SNE applied to molecular sequences, using three embedding methods: One-Hot Encoding, Spike2Vec, and minimizers. Through both subjective visualization and objective metrics (including neighborhood preservation scores), we demonstrate that the cosine similarity kernel in general outperforms other kernels, including Gaussian and isolation kernels, achieving superior runtime efficiency and better preservation of pairwise distances in low-dimensional space.

The contributions collected here span applications from automated equation discovery and emergent-phenomena modelling to the construction of compact emulators for computationally expensive simulations.\n  The introductory review outlines the conceptual foundations of SR, contrasts it with conventional regression approaches, and surveys its main use cases in the physical sciences, including the derivation of effective theories, empirical functional forms and surrogate models. We summarise methodological considerations such as search-space design, operator selection, complexity control, feature selection, and integration with modern AI approaches. We also highlight ongoing challenges, including scalability, robustness to noise, overfitting and computational complexity.

Despite their shared goal, these models have disparate algorithms, theoretical structures, and tradeoffs: discrete diffusion has the most natural domain, Gaussian diffusion has more mature algorithms, and diffusion on the simplex in principle combines the strengths of the other two but in practice suffers from a numerically unstable stochastic processes. Ideally we could see each of these models as instances of the same underlying framework, and enable practitioners to switch between models for downstream applications. However previous theories have only considered connections in special cases. Here we build a theory unifying all three methods of discrete diffusion as different parameterizations of the same underlying process: the Wright-Fisher population genetics model. In particular, we find simplicial and Gaussian diffusion as two large-population limits. Our theory formally connects the likelihoods and hyperparameters of these models and leverages decades of mathematical genetics literature to unlock stable simplicial diffusion. Finally, we relieve the practitioner of balancing model trade-offs by demonstrating it is possible to train a single model that can perform diffusion in any of these three domains at test time. Our experiments show that Wright-Fisher simplicial diffusion is more stable and outperforms previous simplicial diffusion models on conditional DNA generation. We also show that we can train models on multiple domains at once that are competitive with models trained on any individual domain.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u79bb\u6563\u6269\u6563\u3001\u9ad8\u65af\u6269\u6563\u548c\u5355\u7eaf\u5f62\u6269\u6563\u4e09\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u7edf\u4e00\u4e3aWright-Fisher\u79cd\u7fa4\u9057\u4f20\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4e0d\u540c\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u5f62\u5f0f\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u7b97\u6cd5\u4e0d\u7edf\u4e00\u3001\u7406\u8bba\u7ed3\u6784\u5206\u6563\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u79bb\u6563\u5e8f\u5217\u5efa\u6a21\uff08\u5982DNA\u3001\u86cb\u767d\u8d28\u3001\u8bed\u8a00\uff09\u5b58\u5728\u4e09\u79cd\u4e3b\u8981\u6269\u6563\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a\u79bb\u6563\u7a7a\u95f4\u6269\u6563\u3001\u6b27\u51e0\u91cc\u5f97\u7a7a\u95f4\u9ad8\u65af\u6269\u6563\u548c\u5355\u7eaf\u5f62\u6269\u6563\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u65b9\u6cd5\u5177\u6709\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\u3001\u7406\u8bba\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u6743\u8861\u53d6\u820d\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4f7f\u5f97\u5b9e\u8df5\u8005\u96be\u4ee5\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u65b9\u6cd5\u95f4\u5207\u6362\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u4e09\u79cd\u79bb\u6563\u6269\u6563\u65b9\u6cd5\u7edf\u4e00\u4e3aWright-Fisher\u79cd\u7fa4\u9057\u4f20\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4e0d\u540c\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u5f62\u5f0f\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5355\u7eaf\u5f62\u6269\u6563\u548c\u9ad8\u65af\u6269\u6563\u662f\u8be5\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4e24\u4e2a\u5927\u79cd\u7fa4\u6781\u9650\u3002\u5229\u7528\u6570\u5341\u5e74\u6570\u5b66\u9057\u4f20\u5b66\u6587\u732e\u89e3\u9501\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u5355\u7eaf\u5f62\u6269\u6563\uff0c\u5e76\u8bad\u7ec3\u5355\u4e00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u53ef\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u57df\u4e2d\u6267\u884c\u6269\u6563\u3002", "result": "Wright-Fisher\u5355\u7eaf\u5f62\u6269\u6563\u6bd4\u4e4b\u524d\u7684\u5355\u7eaf\u5f62\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u66f4\u7a33\u5b9a\uff0c\u5728\u6761\u4ef6DNA\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u4f18\u3002\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u591a\u57df\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57df\u4e0a\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u5728\u5355\u4e2a\u57df\u4e0a\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u76f8\u5f53\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u7edf\u4e00\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u4e09\u79cd\u79bb\u6563\u6269\u6563\u65b9\u6cd5\u8054\u7cfb\u8d77\u6765\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u5355\u7eaf\u5f62\u6269\u6563\u6570\u503c\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4f7f\u5b9e\u8df5\u8005\u80fd\u591f\u6446\u8131\u6a21\u578b\u6743\u8861\u53d6\u820d\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5355\u4e00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u57df\u95f4\u7075\u6d3b\u5207\u6362\u3002"}}

Yet, VLM decisions are influenced by the perceived demographic attributes of people in the input, which can lead to biased outcomes like failing to identify women as doctors. Moreover, when reducing bias leads to performance loss, users may have varying needs for balancing bias mitigation with overall model capabilities, highlighting the demand for methods that enable controllable bias reduction during inference. Activation steering is a popular approach for inference-time controllability that has shown potential in inducing safer behavior in large language models (LLMs). However, we observe that current steering methods struggle to correct biases, where equiprobable outcomes across demographic groups are required. To address this, we propose Direct Steering Optimization (DSO) which uses reinforcement learning to find linear transformations for steering activations, tailored to mitigate bias while maintaining control over model performance. We demonstrate that DSO achieves state-of-the-art trade-off between fairness and capabilities on both VLMs and LLMs, while offering practitioners inference-time control over the trade-off. Overall, our work highlights the benefit of designing steering strategies that are directly optimized to control model behavior, providing more effective bias intervention than methods that rely on pre-defined heuristics for controllability.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faDSO\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4f18\u5316\u6fc0\u6d3b\u8f6c\u5411\uff0c\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u63a7\u5236\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u504f\u89c1\u4e0e\u6027\u80fd\u6743\u8861", "motivation": "\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u51b3\u7b56\u65f6\u53d7\u4eba\u53e3\u7edf\u8ba1\u5c5e\u6027\u5f71\u54cd\u4ea7\u751f\u504f\u89c1\uff08\u5982\u5c06\u5973\u6027\u8bc6\u522b\u4e3a\u533b\u751f\u7684\u5931\u8d25\u7387\u66f4\u9ad8\uff09\uff0c\u800c\u73b0\u6709\u6fc0\u6d3b\u8f6c\u5411\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u7ea0\u6b63\u9700\u8981\u8de8\u4eba\u53e3\u7fa4\u4f53\u7b49\u6982\u7387\u7ed3\u679c\u7684\u504f\u89c1\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u53ef\u63a7\u504f\u89c1\u51cf\u5c11\u65b9\u6cd5", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u76f4\u63a5\u8f6c\u5411\u4f18\u5316\uff08DSO\uff09\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u5bfb\u627e\u7ebf\u6027\u53d8\u6362\u6765\u8f6c\u5411\u6fc0\u6d3b\uff0c\u4e13\u95e8\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7528\u4e8e\u51cf\u8f7b\u504f\u89c1\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u63a7\u5236", "result": "DSO\u5728\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u4e0e\u80fd\u529b\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u6743\u8861\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4e3a\u4ece\u4e1a\u8005\u63d0\u4f9b\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u5bf9\u6743\u8861\u7684\u63a7\u5236", "conclusion": "\u76f4\u63a5\u4f18\u5316\u8f6c\u5411\u7b56\u7565\u6bd4\u4f9d\u8d56\u9884\u5b9a\u4e49\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u65b9\u6cd5\u66f4\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u5e72\u9884\u504f\u89c1\uff0c\u4e3a\u6a21\u578b\u884c\u4e3a\u63a7\u5236\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5"}}

Conventional supervised learning methods often falter in this domain, struggling to generalize to unseen species and to capture the hierarchical nature of the data. To address these limitations, we introduce BarcodeMamba+, a foundation model for fungal barcode classification built on a powerful and efficient state-space model architecture. We employ a pretrain and fine-tune paradigm, which utilizes partially labelled data and we demonstrate this is substantially more effective than traditional fully-supervised methods in this data-sparse environment. During fine-tuning, we systematically integrate and evaluate a suite of enhancements--including hierarchical label smoothing, a weighted loss function, and a multi-head output layer from MycoAI--to specifically tackle the challenges of fungal taxonomy. Our experiments show that each of these components yields significant performance gains. On a challenging fungal classification benchmark with distinct taxonomic distribution shifts from the broad training set, our final model outperforms a range of existing methods across all taxonomic levels. Our work provides a powerful new tool for genomics-based biodiversity research and establishes an effective and scalable training paradigm for this challenging domain.

However, published studies often list the predictors they use (for example age, diagnosis codes, location). Privacy laws increasingly regulate such data types. We use published decision-tree papers as a proxy for real-world use of legally governed data. We compile a corpus of decision-tree studies and assign each reported predictor to a regulated data category (for example health data, biometric identifiers, children's data, financial attributes, location traces, and government IDs). We then link each category to specific excerpts in European Union and United States privacy laws.

Commodity RFID systems suffer from poor tag localization when dispersed in forested environments due to signal attenuation, multi-path effects and environmental variability. Current methods to address this issue via fingerprinting rely on dispersing tags at known locations {\\em a priori}. In this paper, we address the case when it is not possible to tag known locations and show that it is possible to localize tags to accuracies comparable to global positioning systems (GPS) without such a constraint. For this, we propose Gaussian Process to model various environments solely based on RF signal response signatures and without the aid of additional sensors such as global positioning GPS or cameras, and match an unknown RF to the closest match in a model dictionary. We utilize a new weighted log-likelihood method to associate an unknown environment with the closest environment in a dictionary of previously modeled environments, which is a crucial step in being able to use our approach. Our results show that it is possible to achieve localization accuracies of the order of GPS, but with passive commodity RFID, which will allow the tracking of dozens of wildfire assets within the vicinity of mobile readers at-a-time simultaneously, does not require known positions to be tagged {\\em a priori}, and can achieve localization at a fraction of the cost compared to GPS.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5546\u54c1RFID\u7684\u68ee\u6797\u8d44\u4ea7\u8ffd\u8e2a\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u9884\u5148\u6807\u8bb0\u5df2\u77e5\u4f4d\u7f6e\u5373\u53ef\u8fbe\u5230GPS\u7ea7\u522b\u7684\u5b9a\u4f4d\u7cbe\u5ea6", "motivation": "\u5728\u68ee\u6797\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\uff0c\u5546\u54c1RFID\u7cfb\u7edf\u7531\u4e8e\u4fe1\u53f7\u8870\u51cf\u3001\u591a\u5f84\u6548\u5e94\u548c\u73af\u5883\u53d8\u5316\u5bfc\u81f4\u6807\u7b7e\u5b9a\u4f4d\u56f0\u96be\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u6307\u7eb9\u8bc6\u522b\u65b9\u6cd5\u9700\u8981\u9884\u5148\u5728\u5df2\u77e5\u4f4d\u7f6e\u90e8\u7f72\u6807\u7b7e\uff0c\u8fd9\u5728\u67d0\u4e9b\u5e94\u7528\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u4e0d\u53ef\u884c\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u9ad8\u65af\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5efa\u6a21\u4e0d\u540c\u73af\u5883\u7684RF\u4fe1\u53f7\u54cd\u5e94\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u65e0\u9700GPS\u6216\u6444\u50cf\u5934\u7b49\u989d\u5916\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u3002\u63d0\u51fa\u52a0\u6743\u5bf9\u6570\u4f3c\u7136\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c06\u672a\u77e5\u73af\u5883\u4e0e\u9884\u5148\u5efa\u6a21\u7684\u73af\u5883\u5b57\u5178\u8fdb\u884c\u5339\u914d\u3002", "result": "\u80fd\u591f\u8fbe\u5230GPS\u7ea7\u522b\u7684\u5b9a\u4f4d\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u53ef\u540c\u65f6\u8ffd\u8e2a\u6570\u5341\u4e2a\u91ce\u706b\u54cd\u5e94\u8d44\u4ea7\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u9884\u5148\u6807\u8bb0\u5df2\u77e5\u4f4d\u7f6e\uff0c\u6210\u672c\u8fdc\u4f4e\u4e8eGPS\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u68ee\u6797\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u8d44\u4ea7\u8ffd\u8e2a\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6210\u672c\u6548\u76ca\u9ad8\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u91ce\u706b\u54cd\u5e94\u7b49\u5e94\u7528\u573a\u666f\u3002"}}

While traditional low-rank approximations often rely on static rank assumptions--limiting their flexibility across diverse input contexts--our method dynamically selects ranks based on real-time sequence dynamics, layer-specific sensitivities, and hardware constraints. The core innovation lies in an RL agent that formulates rank selection as a sequential policy optimization problem, where the reward function strictly balances attention fidelity against computational latency. Crucially, we employ online matrix perturbation bounds to enable incremental rank updates, thereby avoiding the prohibitive cost of full decomposition during inference. Furthermore, the integration of a lightweight Transformer-based policy network and batched Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) operations ensures scalable deployment on modern GPU architectures. Experiments demonstrate that DR-RL maintains downstream accuracy statistically equivalent to full-rank attention while significantly reducing Floating Point Operations (FLOPs), particularly in long-sequence regimes (L > 4096). This work bridges the gap between adaptive efficiency and theoretical rigor in MHSA, offering a principled, mathematically grounded alternative to heuristic rank reduction techniques in resource-constrained deep learning.

We study the following fundamental setting for learning features in superposition from black-box query access: we are given query access to a function \\[ f(x)=\\sum_{i=1}^n a_i\\,\u03c3_i(v_i^\\top x), \\] where each unit vector $v_i$ encodes a feature direction and $\u03c3_i:\\mathbb{R} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$ is an arbitrary response function and our goal is to recover the $v_i$ and the function $f$.\n  In learning-theoretic terms, superposition refers to the overcomplete regime, when the number of features is larger than the underlying dimension (i.e. $n > d$), which has proven especially challenging for typical algorithmic approaches. Our main result is an efficient query algorithm that, from noisy oracle access to $f$, identifies all feature directions whose responses are non-degenerate and reconstructs the function $f$. Crucially, our algorithm works in a significantly more general setting than all related prior results -- we allow for essentially arbitrary superpositions, only requiring that $v_i, v_j$ are not nearly identical for $i \\neq j$, and general response functions $\u03c3_i$. At a high level, our algorithm introduces an approach for searching in Fourier space by iteratively refining the search space to locate the hidden directions $v_i$.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u67e5\u8be2\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u4ece\u566a\u58f0oracle\u8bbf\u95ee\u4e2d\u6062\u590d\u53e0\u52a0\u7279\u5f81\u65b9\u5411\u548c\u975e\u9000\u5316\u54cd\u5e94\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u4efb\u610f\u53e0\u52a0\u548c\u4e00\u822c\u54cd\u5e94\u51fd\u6570", "motivation": "\u590d\u6742\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u901a\u5e38\u901a\u8fc7\u7ebf\u6027\u8868\u793a\u7f16\u7801\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u4f46\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7279\u5f81\u4ee5\u53e0\u52a0\u5f62\u5f0f\u5b58\u5728\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u6062\u590d\u3002\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u8fc7\u5b8c\u5907\u673a\u5236\uff08\u7279\u5f81\u6570\u5927\u4e8e\u7ef4\u5ea6\uff09\u4e0b\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u7b97\u6cd5\u9762\u4e34\u6311\u6218", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u566a\u58f0oracle\u8bbf\u95ee\u51fd\u6570f\uff0c\u5728\u5085\u91cc\u53f6\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u8fed\u4ee3\u7ec6\u5316\u641c\u7d22\u7a7a\u95f4\u6765\u5b9a\u4f4d\u9690\u85cf\u65b9\u5411vi\uff0c\u7b97\u6cd5\u80fd\u5904\u7406\u4efb\u610f\u53e0\u52a0\u548c\u4e00\u822c\u54cd\u5e94\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u4ec5\u8981\u6c42\u4e0d\u540c\u7279\u5f81\u65b9\u5411\u4e0d\u8fd1\u4f3c\u76f8\u540c", "result": "\u5f00\u53d1\u51fa\u9ad8\u6548\u67e5\u8be2\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u8bc6\u522b\u6240\u6709\u975e\u9000\u5316\u54cd\u5e94\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u65b9\u5411\u5e76\u91cd\u6784\u51fd\u6570f\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u5148\u524d\u7ed3\u679c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u66f4\u4e00\u822c\u7684\u8bbe\u7f6e", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7b97\u6cd5\u4e3a\u5b66\u4e60\u53e0\u52a0\u7279\u5f81\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u7a81\u7834\u4e86\u8fc7\u5b8c\u5907\u673a\u5236\u4e0b\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u5e7f\u6cdb\u9002\u7528\u6027"}}

We demonstrate SNAC-Pack on a high energy physics jet classification task, achieving 63.84% accuracy with resource estimation. When synthesized on a Xilinx Virtex UltraScale+ VU13P FPGA, the SNAC-Pack model matches baseline accuracy while maintaining comparable resource utilization to models optimized using traditional BOPs metrics.

However, both transfer learning and the exploitation of spatial variability in this field are challenging, as they involve heterogeneous data and complex cross-scale dependencies. Conventional approaches often rely on location-independent parameterizations and independent training, underutilizing transfer learning and spatial heterogeneity in the inputs, and limiting their applicability in regions with substantial variability. We propose FTBSC-KGML (Fine-Tuning-Based Site Calibration-Knowledge-Guided Machine Learning), a pretraining- and fine-tuning-based, spatial-variability-aware, and knowledge-guided machine learning framework that augments KGML-ag with a pretraining-fine-tuning process and site-specific parameters. Using a pretraining-fine-tuning process with remote-sensing GPP, climate, and soil covariates collected across multiple midwestern sites, FTBSC-KGML estimates land emissions while leveraging transfer learning and spatial heterogeneity. A key component is a spatial-heterogeneity-aware transfer-learning scheme, which is a globally pretrained model that is fine-tuned at each state or site to learn place-aware representations, thereby improving local accuracy under limited data without sacrificing interpretability.

However, they suffer from diseconomies of scale, and their financial viability remains unconvincing. One step in addressing this shortcoming is to design these reactors with comprehensive economic and physics analyses informing early-stage design iteration. In this work, we present a novel unifying geometric design optimization approach that accounts for techno-economic considerations. We start by generating random samples to train surrogate models, including Gaussian processes (GPs) and multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs). We then deploy these surrogates within a reinforcement learning (RL)-based optimization framework to optimize the levelized cost of electricity (LCOE), all the while imposing constraints on the fuel lifetime, shutdown margin (SDM), peak heat flux, and rod-integrated peaking factor. We study two cases: one in which the axial reflector cost is very high, and one in which it is inexpensive. We found that the operation and maintenance and capital costs are the primary contributors to the overall LCOE particularly the cost of the axial reflectors (for the first case) and the control drum materials. The optimizer cleverly changes the design parameters so as to minimize one of them while still satisfying the constraints, ultimately reducing the LCOE by more than 57% in both instances. A comprehensive integration of fuel and HP performance with multi-objective optimization is currently being pursued to fully understand the interaction between constraints and cost performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u70ed\u7ba1\u5fae\u53cd\u5e94\u5668\uff0c\u5c06\u5e73\u51c6\u5316\u7535\u529b\u6210\u672c\u964d\u4f4e57%\u4ee5\u4e0a", "motivation": "\u70ed\u7ba1\u5fae\u53cd\u5e94\u5668\u9002\u5408\u504f\u8fdc\u5730\u533a\u4f9b\u7535\uff0c\u4f46\u5b58\u5728\u89c4\u6a21\u4e0d\u7ecf\u6d4e\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u8d22\u52a1\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u65e9\u671f\u8bbe\u8ba1\u9636\u6bb5\u5c31\u8003\u8651\u7ecf\u6d4e\u4e0e\u7269\u7406\u5206\u6790", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u968f\u673a\u6837\u672c\u8bad\u7ec3\u9ad8\u65af\u8fc7\u7a0b\u548c\u591a\u5c42\u611f\u77e5\u673a\u4ee3\u7406\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u90e8\u7f72\u5728\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4f18\u5316\u6846\u67b6\u4e2d\uff0c\u4f18\u5316\u5e73\u51c6\u5316\u7535\u529b\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u7ea6\u675f\u71c3\u6599\u5bff\u547d\u3001\u505c\u5806\u88d5\u5ea6\u3001\u5cf0\u503c\u70ed\u901a\u91cf\u548c\u68d2\u79ef\u5206\u5cf0\u503c\u56e0\u5b50", "result": "\u8fd0\u884c\u7ef4\u62a4\u6210\u672c\u548c\u8d44\u672c\u6210\u672c\u662f\u5e73\u51c6\u5316\u7535\u529b\u6210\u672c\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u8d21\u732e\u8005\uff0c\u4f18\u5316\u5668\u5de7\u5999\u8c03\u6574\u8bbe\u8ba1\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u5728\u6ee1\u8db3\u7ea6\u675f\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u5c06\u5e73\u51c6\u5316\u7535\u529b\u6210\u672c\u964d\u4f4e\u8d85\u8fc757%", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u6574\u5408\u6280\u672f\u7ecf\u6d4e\u8003\u91cf\uff0c\u672a\u6765\u5c06\u8fdb\u884c\u71c3\u6599\u548c\u70ed\u7ba1\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u5168\u9762\u96c6\u6210\uff0c\u4ee5\u6df1\u5165\u7406\u89e3\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0e\u6210\u672c\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528"}}

While deep learning models have achieved strong predictive performance, they often overlook underlying physical processes, limiting interpretability and generalization. Recent causal learning approaches address these issues by integrating domain knowledge, yet they typically rely on fixed causal graphs that fail to adapt to data. We propose CauStream, a unified framework for causal spatiotemporal streamflow forecasting. CauSTream jointly learns (i) a runoff causal graph among meteorological forcings and (ii) a routing graph capturing dynamic dependencies across stations. We further establish identifiability conditions for these causal structures under a nonparametric setting. We evaluate CauSTream on three major U.S. river basins across three forecasting horizons. The model consistently outperforms prior state-of-the-art methods, with performance gaps widening at longer forecast windows, indicating stronger generalization to unseen conditions. Beyond forecasting, CauSTream also learns causal graphs that capture relationships among hydrological factors and stations. The inferred structures align closely with established domain knowledge, offering interpretable insights into watershed dynamics.

ICL had originally been thought to emerge from the self-attention mechanism in autoregressive transformer architectures. DeepOSets is a non-autoregressive, non-attention based neural architecture that combines set learning via the DeepSets architecture with operator learning via Deep Operator Networks (DeepONets). In a previous study, DeepOSets was shown to display ICL capabilities in supervised learning problems. In this paper, we show that the DeepOSets architecture, with the appropriate modifications, is a multi-operator in-context learner that can recover the solution operator of a new PDE, not seen during training, from example pairs of parameter and solution placed in a user prompt, without any weight updates. Furthermore, we show that DeepOSets is a universal uniform approximator over a class of continuous operators, which we believe is the first result of its kind in the literature of scientific machine learning. This means that a single DeepOSets architecture exists that approximates in-context any continuous operator in the class to any fixed desired degree accuracy, given an appropriate number of examples in the prompt. Experiments with Poisson and reaction-diffusion forward and inverse boundary-value problems demonstrate the ability of the proposed model to use in-context examples to predict accurately the solutions corresponding to parameter queries for PDEs not seen during training.", "AI": {"tldr": "DeepOSets\u67b6\u6784\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408DeepSets\u548cDeepONets\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u591a\u7b97\u5b50\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5b66\u4e60\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u4ece\u63d0\u793a\u4e2d\u7684\u793a\u4f8b\u5bf9\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e60\u65b0\u7684PDE\u89e3\u7b97\u5b50\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u6743\u91cd\u66f4\u65b0\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5176\u4f5c\u4e3a\u901a\u7528\u5747\u5300\u903c\u8fd1\u5668\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u63a2\u7d22\u975e\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u3001\u975e\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u67b6\u6784\u662f\u5426\u4e5f\u80fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5b66\u4e60\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u79d1\u5b66\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u9886\u57df\uff0c\u4e3aPDE\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b0\u7684\u7b97\u5b50\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u6539\u8fdb\u7684DeepOSets\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408DeepSets\u7684\u96c6\u5408\u5b66\u4e60\u548cDeepONets\u7684\u7b97\u5b50\u5b66\u4e60\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7528\u6237\u63d0\u793a\u4e2d\u7684\u53c2\u6570-\u89e3\u793a\u4f8b\u5bf9\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9\u65b0PDE\u89e3\u7b97\u5b50\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5b66\u4e60\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660eDeepOSets\u80fd\u591f\u51c6\u786e\u9884\u6d4b\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u672a\u89c1PDE\u7684\u89e3\uff0c\u5728\u6cca\u677e\u65b9\u7a0b\u548c\u53cd\u5e94\u6269\u6563\u65b9\u7a0b\u7684\u6b63\u53cd\u8fb9\u754c\u503c\u95ee\u9898\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u5e76\u9996\u6b21\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u8be5\u67b6\u6784\u662f\u8fde\u7eed\u7b97\u5b50\u7c7b\u7684\u901a\u7528\u5747\u5300\u903c\u8fd1\u5668\u3002", "conclusion": "DeepOSets\u67b6\u6784\u6210\u529f\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u591a\u7b97\u5b50\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5b66\u4e60\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4e3a\u79d1\u5b66\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u975e\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u7406\u8bba\u4fdd\u8bc1\u548c\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4ef7\u503c\u3002"}}

At the same time, released data should retain its usefulness for model-training. The standard method for private information obfuscation in images is Gaussian blurring. In this work, we show that practical implementations of Gaussian blurring are reversible enough to break privacy. We then take a closer look at the privacy-utility tradeoffs offered by three other obfuscation algorithms -- pixelization, pixelization and noise addition (DP-Pix), and cropping. Privacy is evaluated by reversal and discrimination attacks, while utility by the quality of the learnt representations when the model is trained on data with obfuscated faces. We show that the most popular industry-standard method, Gaussian blur is the least private of the four -- being susceptible to reversal attacks in its practical low-precision implementations. In contrast, pixelization and pixelization plus noise addition, when used at the right level of granularity, offer both privacy and utility for a number of computer vision tasks.

Retail investors, regulators, and brokerages need tools that connect online narratives and coordination patterns to market behavior. We present AIMM, an AI-driven framework that fuses Reddit activity, bot and coordination indicators, and OHLCV market features into a daily AIMM Manipulation Risk Score for each ticker.\n  The system uses a parquet-native pipeline with a Streamlit dashboard that allows analysts to explore suspicious windows, inspect underlying posts and price action, and log model outputs over time. Due to Reddit API restrictions, we employ calibrated synthetic social features matching documented event characteristics; market data (OHLCV) uses real historical data from Yahoo Finance. This release makes three contributions. First, we build the AIMM Ground Truth dataset (AIMM-GT): 33 labeled ticker-days spanning eight equities, drawing from SEC enforcement actions, community-verified manipulation cases, and matched normal controls.

Under a linear Gaussian structural equation model (SEM) with equal noise variances, the problem is identifiable and we show that the ensemble precision matrix of the observations exhibits a distinctive structure that facilitates DAG recovery. Exploiting this property, we propose BUILD (Bottom-Up Inference of Linear DAGs), a deterministic stepwise algorithm that identifies leaf nodes and their parents, then prunes the leaves by removing incident edges to proceed to the next step, exactly reconstructing the DAG from the true precision matrix. In practice, precision matrices must be estimated from finite data, and ill-conditioning may lead to error accumulation across BUILD steps. As a mitigation strategy, we periodically re-estimate the precision matrix (with less variables as leaves are pruned), trading off runtime for enhanced robustness. Reproducible results on challenging synthetic benchmarks demonstrate that BUILD compares favorably to state-of-the-art DAG learning algorithms, while offering an explicit handle on complexity.", "AI": {"tldr": "BUILD\u7b97\u6cd5\u5229\u7528\u89c2\u6d4b\u6570\u636e\u7684\u7cbe\u5ea6\u77e9\u9635\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u5e95\u5411\u4e0a\u9010\u6b65\u8bc6\u522b\u53f6\u8282\u70b9\u5e76\u526a\u679d\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u7ebf\u6027\u9ad8\u65afSEM\u4e0bDAG\u7684\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u91cd\u6784\u3002", "motivation": "\u4ece\u89c2\u6d4b\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e60\u6709\u5411\u65e0\u73af\u56fe\u7ed3\u6784\u662f\u56e0\u679c\u53d1\u73b0\u3001\u7edf\u8ba1\u4fe1\u53f7\u5904\u7406\u548c\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u6838\u5fc3\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u5728\u7ebf\u6027\u9ad8\u65af\u7ed3\u6784\u65b9\u7a0b\u6a21\u578b\u4e14\u566a\u58f0\u65b9\u5dee\u76f8\u7b49\u7684\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\uff0c\u8be5\u95ee\u9898\u662f\u53ef\u8bc6\u522b\u7684\uff0c\u4f46\u9700\u8981\u9ad8\u6548\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\u6765\u51c6\u786e\u91cd\u6784DAG\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faBUILD\u7b97\u6cd5\uff1a\u5229\u7528\u89c2\u6d4b\u6570\u636e\u7cbe\u5ea6\u77e9\u9635\u7684\u7279\u6b8a\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u9010\u6b65\u65b9\u6cd5\u8bc6\u522b\u53f6\u8282\u70b9\u53ca\u5176\u7236\u8282\u70b9\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u526a\u9664\u53f6\u8282\u70b9\u53ca\u76f8\u5173\u8fb9\uff0c\u8fed\u4ee3\u8fdb\u884c\u76f4\u5230\u5b8c\u5168\u91cd\u6784DAG\u3002\u4e3a\u5e94\u5bf9\u6709\u9650\u6570\u636e\u4f30\u8ba1\u7cbe\u5ea6\u77e9\u9635\u7684\u8bef\u5dee\u79ef\u7d2f\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u5468\u671f\u6027\u91cd\u65b0\u4f30\u8ba1\u7cbe\u5ea6\u77e9\u9635\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\u7684\u5408\u6210\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cBUILD\u7b97\u6cd5\u76f8\u6bd4\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684DAG\u5b66\u4e60\u7b97\u6cd5\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5bf9\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u7684\u660e\u786e\u63a7\u5236\u3002", "conclusion": "BUILD\u7b97\u6cd5\u5229\u7528\u7ebf\u6027\u9ad8\u65afSEM\u4e0b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u77e9\u9635\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u7684\u81ea\u5e95\u5411\u4e0aDAG\u91cd\u6784\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u4e4b\u95f4\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u826f\u597d\u5e73\u8861\uff0c\u4e3aDAG\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u6709\u6548\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

While it protects the rights of users requesting unlearning, it also introduces new privacy risks. Prior works have primarily focused on the privacy of data that has been unlearned, while the risks to retained data remain largely unexplored. To address this gap, we focus on the privacy risks of retained data and, for the first time, reveal the vulnerabilities introduced by machine unlearning under the dual-view setting, where an adversary can query both the original and the unlearned models. From an information-theoretic perspective, we introduce the concept of {privacy knowledge gain} and demonstrate that the dual-view setting allows adversaries to obtain more information than querying either model alone, thereby amplifying privacy leakage. To effectively demonstrate this threat, we propose DVIA, a Dual-View Inference Attack, which extracts membership information on retained data using black-box queries to both models. DVIA eliminates the need to train an attack model and employs a lightweight likelihood ratio inference module for efficient inference. Experiments across different datasets and model architectures validate the effectiveness of DVIA and highlight the privacy risks inherent in the dual-view setting.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u9996\u6b21\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u673a\u5668\u9057\u5fd8\u5728\u53cc\u89c6\u56fe\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u7684\u9690\u79c1\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u63d0\u51faDVIA\u653b\u51fb\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u653b\u51fb\u8005\u901a\u8fc7\u67e5\u8be2\u539f\u59cb\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u9057\u5fd8\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u4ee5\u83b7\u5f97\u6bd4\u5355\u72ec\u67e5\u8be2\u4efb\u4e00\u6a21\u578b\u66f4\u591a\u7684\u9690\u79c1\u4fe1\u606f\u3002", "motivation": "\u673a\u5668\u9057\u5fd8\u6280\u672f\u867d\u7136\u80fd\u4fdd\u62a4\u8bf7\u6c42\u9057\u5fd8\u7684\u7528\u6237\u6743\u5229\uff0c\u4f46\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u9690\u79c1\u98ce\u9669\u3002\u5148\u524d\u7814\u7a76\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u5df2\u9057\u5fd8\u6570\u636e\u7684\u9690\u79c1\uff0c\u800c\u5bf9\u4fdd\u7559\u6570\u636e\u7684\u9690\u79c1\u98ce\u9669\u7814\u7a76\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u586b\u8865\u8fd9\u4e00\u7a7a\u767d\uff0c\u9996\u6b21\u63ed\u793a\u673a\u5668\u9057\u5fd8\u5728\u53cc\u89c6\u56fe\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u7684\u9690\u79c1\u6f0f\u6d1e\u3002", "method": "\u4ece\u4fe1\u606f\u8bba\u89d2\u5ea6\u5f15\u5165\"\u9690\u79c1\u77e5\u8bc6\u589e\u76ca\"\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u53cc\u89c6\u56fe\u8bbe\u7f6e\u80fd\u8ba9\u653b\u51fb\u8005\u83b7\u5f97\u66f4\u591a\u4fe1\u606f\u3002\u63d0\u51faDVIA\uff08\u53cc\u89c6\u56fe\u63a8\u7406\u653b\u51fb\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9ed1\u76d2\u67e5\u8be2\u4e24\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u4f3c\u7136\u6bd4\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u5757\u63d0\u53d6\u4fdd\u7559\u6570\u636e\u7684\u6210\u5458\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u653b\u51fb\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u67b6\u6784\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86DVIA\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u7a81\u663e\u4e86\u53cc\u89c6\u56fe\u8bbe\u7f6e\u56fa\u6709\u7684\u9690\u79c1\u98ce\u9669\u3002\u653b\u51fb\u8005\u901a\u8fc7\u67e5\u8be2\u4e24\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u83b7\u5f97\u6bd4\u5355\u72ec\u67e5\u8be2\u4efb\u4e00\u6a21\u578b\u66f4\u591a\u7684\u9690\u79c1\u4fe1\u606f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u673a\u5668\u9057\u5fd8\u5728\u53cc\u89c6\u56fe\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u4f1a\u653e\u5927\u9690\u79c1\u6cc4\u9732\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u4fdd\u7559\u6570\u636e\u9762\u4e34\u65b0\u7684\u5a01\u80c1\u3002DVIA\u653b\u51fb\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u8fd9\u4e00\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u4e3a\u673a\u5668\u9057\u5fd8\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u91cd\u8981\u542f\u793a\u3002"}}

Using this stack, we run both SFT and RL training on top of the GLM-4.5-Air-Base model, scaling RL training up to 512 H200s with high training efficiency.", "AI": {"tldr": "INTELLECT-3\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a106B\u53c2\u6570\u7684MoE\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u5728\u6570\u5b66\u3001\u4ee3\u7801\u3001\u79d1\u5b66\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u8fbe\u5230SOTA\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u5f00\u6e90\u4e86\u5b8c\u6574\u7684RL\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\u6808\u3002", "motivation": "\u6784\u5efa\u4e00\u4e2a\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u9886\u57df\uff08\u6570\u5b66\u3001\u4ee3\u7801\u3001\u79d1\u5b66\u3001\u63a8\u7406\uff09\u5177\u6709\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u9ad8\u6548MoE\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5f00\u6e90\u5b8c\u6574\u7684RL\u8bad\u7ec3\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\uff0c\u4fc3\u8fdb\u793e\u533a\u7814\u7a76\u548c\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528106B\u53c2\u6570\u7684MoE\u67b6\u6784\uff0812B\u6fc0\u6d3b\uff09\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8eGLM-4.5-Air-Base\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86prime-rl\u6846\u67b6\u652f\u6301\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5f02\u6b65RL\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u4ece\u5355\u8282\u70b9\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u6570\u5343GPU\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u591a\u8f6e\u4ea4\u4e92\u548c\u5de5\u5177\u4f7f\u7528\u3002", "result": "INTELLECT-3\u5728\u5176\u89c4\u6a21\u4e0b\u5728\u6570\u5b66\u3001\u4ee3\u7801\u3001\u79d1\u5b66\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u8fbe\u5230\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e86\u8bb8\u591a\u66f4\u5927\u7684\u524d\u6cbf\u6a21\u578b\u3002RL\u8bad\u7ec3\u6269\u5c55\u5230512\u4e2aH200 GPU\u5e76\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u8bad\u7ec3\u6548\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6210\u529f\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u7684INTELLECT-3\u6a21\u578b\u5e76\u5f00\u6e90\u4e86\u5b8c\u6574\u7684RL\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\u6808\uff0c\u5305\u62ecprime-rl\u6846\u67b6\u3001\u8bad\u7ec3\u914d\u65b9\u548c\u73af\u5883\u5e93\uff0c\u4e3a\u793e\u533a\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u5de5\u5177\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u8d44\u6e90\u3002"}}

This work proposes a multimodal framework that converts hand-drawn cube sketches into graph-structured representations capturing geometric and topological properties, and integrates these features with demographic information and neuropsychological test (NPT) scores for AD classification. Cube drawings are modeled as graphs with node features encoding spatial coordinates, local graphlet-based topology, and angular geometry, which are processed using graph neural networks and fused with age, education, and NPT features in a late-fusion model. Experimental results show that graph-based representations provide a strong unimodal baseline and substantially outperform pixel-based convolutional models, while multimodal integration further improves performance and robustness to class imbalance. SHAP-based interpretability analysis identifies specific graphlet motifs and geometric distortions as key predictors, closely aligning with clinical observations of disorganized cube drawings in AD.

Despite its widespread use, the theoretical understanding of rank-based ZO methods remains limited: existing analyses provide only asymptotic insights and do not yield explicit convergence rates for algorithms selecting the top-$k$ directions.\n  This work closes this gap by analyzing a simple rank-based ZO algorithm and establishing the first \\emph{explicit}, and \\emph{non-asymptotic} query complexities. For a $d$-dimension problem, if the function is $L$-smooth and $\u03bc$-strongly convex, the algorithm achieves $\\widetilde{\\mathcal O}\\!\\left(\\frac{dL}\u03bc\\log\\!\\frac{dL}{\u03bc\u03b4}\\log\\!\\frac{1}{\\varepsilon}\\right)$ to find an $\\varepsilon$-suboptimal solution, and for smooth nonconvex objectives it reaches $\\mathcal O\\!\\left(\\frac{dL}{\\varepsilon}\\log\\!\\frac{1}{\\varepsilon}\\right)$.

Rapid mass flows, including landslides and avalanches, cause several thousand deaths across a wide range of environments, often travelling many kilometres from their source. The wide range of source conditions and material properties governing these flows makes their runout difficult to anticipate, particularly for downstream communities that may be suddenly exposed to severe impacts. Accurately predicting runout at scale requires models that are both physically realistic and computationally efficient, yet existing approaches face a fundamental speed-realism trade-off. Here we train a machine learning model to predict geohazard runout across representative real world terrains. The model predicts both flow extent and deposit thickness with high accuracy and 100 to 10,000 times faster computation than numerical solvers. It is trained on over 100,000 numerical simulations across over 10,000 real world digital elevation model chips and reproduces key physical behaviours, including avulsion and deposition patterns, while generalizing across different flow types, sizes and landscapes. Our results demonstrate that neural emulation enables rapid, spatially resolved runout prediction across diverse real world terrains, opening new opportunities for disaster risk reduction and impact-based forecasting. These results highlight neural emulation as a promising pathway for extending physically realistic geohazard modelling to spatial and temporal scales relevant for large scale early warning systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4f7f\u7528\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u6d4b\u5730\u8d28\u707e\u5bb3\uff08\u6ed1\u5761\u3001\u96ea\u5d29\u7b49\uff09\u7684\u8fd0\u79fb\u8ddd\u79bb\u548c\u6c89\u79ef\u539a\u5ea6\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u901f\u5ea6\u6bd4\u6570\u503c\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u5feb100-10000\u500d\uff0c\u51c6\u786e\u5ea6\u9ad8\u4e14\u80fd\u6cdb\u5316\u5230\u4e0d\u540c\u5730\u5f62\u548c\u707e\u5bb3\u7c7b\u578b\u3002", "motivation": "\u5730\u8d28\u707e\u5bb3\uff08\u6ed1\u5761\u3001\u96ea\u5d29\u7b49\uff09\u7684\u8fd0\u79fb\u8ddd\u79bb\u9884\u6d4b\u5bf9\u4fdd\u62a4\u751f\u547d\u3001\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\u548c\u751f\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u9762\u4e34\u8ba1\u7b97\u901f\u5ea6\u4e0e\u7269\u7406\u771f\u5b9e\u6027\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6743\u8861\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u540c\u65f6\u6ee1\u8db3\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "method": "\u8bad\u7ec3\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u6765\u9884\u6d4b\u5730\u8d28\u707e\u5bb3\u8fd0\u79fb\u8ddd\u79bb\u3002\u6a21\u578b\u57fa\u4e8e\u8d85\u8fc710\u4e07\u4e2a\u6570\u503c\u6a21\u62df\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u8986\u76d61\u4e07\u591a\u4e2a\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u6570\u5b57\u9ad8\u7a0b\u6a21\u578b\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u9884\u6d4b\u6d41\u52a8\u8303\u56f4\u548c\u6c89\u79ef\u539a\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u591f\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u9884\u6d4b\u6d41\u52a8\u8303\u56f4\u548c\u6c89\u79ef\u539a\u5ea6\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u901f\u5ea6\u6bd4\u6570\u503c\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u5feb100-10000\u500d\u3002\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u591f\u91cd\u73b0\u5173\u952e\u7269\u7406\u884c\u4e3a\uff08\u5982\u5206\u6d41\u548c\u6c89\u79ef\u6a21\u5f0f\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u80fd\u6cdb\u5316\u5230\u4e0d\u540c\u6d41\u52a8\u7c7b\u578b\u3001\u89c4\u6a21\u548c\u5730\u5f62\u3002", "conclusion": "\u795e\u7ecf\u4eff\u771f\u6280\u672f\u80fd\u591f\u5b9e\u73b0\u8de8\u591a\u6837\u5316\u771f\u5b9e\u5730\u5f62\u7684\u5feb\u901f\u3001\u7a7a\u95f4\u89e3\u6790\u7684\u8fd0\u79fb\u8ddd\u79bb\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u4e3a\u707e\u5bb3\u98ce\u9669\u51cf\u5c11\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f71\u54cd\u7684\u9884\u62a5\u5f00\u8f9f\u65b0\u673a\u4f1a\uff0c\u662f\u6269\u5c55\u7269\u7406\u771f\u5b9e\u5730\u8d28\u707e\u5bb3\u5efa\u6a21\u5230\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u9884\u8b66\u7cfb\u7edf\u76f8\u5173\u65f6\u7a7a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u7684\u6709\u524d\u666f\u9014\u5f84\u3002"}}

Existing methods typically treat all OOD samples as a single class, despite real-world applications, especially high-stake settings such as fraud detection and medical diagnosis, demanding deeper insights into OOD samples, including their probable labels. This raises a critical question: can OOD detection be extended to OOD classification without true label information? To address this question, we propose a Coarse-to-Fine open-set Classification (CFC) framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) for graph datasets. CFC consists of three key components: a coarse classifier that uses LLM prompts for OOD detection and outlier label generation, a GNN-based fine classifier trained with OOD samples identified by the coarse classifier for enhanced OOD detection and ID classification, and refined OOD classification achieved through LLM prompts and post-processed OOD labels. Unlike methods that rely on synthetic or auxiliary OOD samples, CFC employs semantic OOD instances that are genuinely out-of-distribution based on their inherent meaning, improving interpretability and practical utility.

Federated graph learning (FGL) addresses this by enabling collaborative GNN model training without sharing private data. However, a core challenge in FGL systems is the variation in local training data distributions among clients, known as the data heterogeneity problem. Most existing solutions suffer from two problems: (1) The typical optimizer based on empirical risk minimization tends to cause local models to fall into sharp valleys and weakens their generalization to out-of-distribution graph data. (2) The prevalent dimensional collapse in the learned representations of local graph data has an adverse impact on the classification capacity of the GNN model. To this end, we formulate a novel optimization objective that is aware of the sharpness (i.e., the curvature of the loss surface) of local GNN models. By minimizing the loss function and its sharpness simultaneously, we seek out model parameters in a flat region with uniformly low loss values, thus improving the generalization over heterogeneous data.

Recent studies suggest that machine unlearning can help ensure deployed models comply with evolving legal, safety, and governance requirements. However, current unlearning techniques assume clean separation between forget and retain datasets, which is challenging in operational settings characterized by highly entangled distributions. In such scenarios, perturbation-based methods often degrade general model utility or fail to ensure safety. To address this, we propose Selective Representation Misdirection for Unlearning (SRMU), a novel principled activation-editing framework that enforces feature-aware and directionally controlled perturbations. Unlike indiscriminate model weights perturbations, SRMU employs a structured misdirection vector with an activation importance map. The goal is to allow SRMU selectively suppresses harmful representations while preserving the utility on benign ones. Experiments are conducted on the widely used WMDP benchmark across low- and high-entanglement configurations. Empirical results reveal that SRMU delivers state-of-the-art unlearning performance with minimal utility losses, and remains effective under 20-30\\% overlap where existing baselines collapse. SRMU provides a robust foundation for safety-driven model governance, privacy compliance, and controlled knowledge removal in the emerging LLM-based applications.

Here we present the Pretrained Battery Transformer (PBT), the first FM for battery life prediction, developed through domain-knowledge-encoded mixture-of-expert layers. Validated on the largest public battery life database, PBT learns transferable representations from 13 lithium-ion battery (LIB) datasets, outperforming existing models by an average of 19.8%. With transfer learning, PBT achieves state-of-the-art performance across 15 diverse datasets encompassing various operating conditions, formation protocols, and chemistries of LIBs.

Unlike traditional verification approaches that merely return a single counterexample when the fairness is violated, quantitative verification estimates the ratio of all counterexamples and characterizes the regions where they occur, which is important information for diagnosing and mitigating bias. To date, quantitative verification has been explored almost exclusively for deep neural networks (DNNs). Representative methods, such as DeepGemini and FairQuant, all build on the core idea of Counterexample-Guided Abstraction Refinement, a generic framework that could be adapted to other model classes. We extended the framework into a model-agnostic form, but discovered two limitations: (i) it can provide only lower bounds, and (ii) its performance scales poorly.

However, existing research faces two limitations: (1) the high complexity of optimizing water-nitrogen combinations during crop growth and poor yield optimization results; and (2) the difficulty in quantifying mild stress signals and the delayed feedback, which results in less precise dynamic regulation of water and nitrogen and lower resource utilization efficiency. To address these issues, we propose a Nested Dual-Agent Reinforcement Learning (NDRL) method. The parent agent in NDRL identifies promising macroscopic irrigation and fertilization actions based on projected cumulative yield benefits, reducing ineffective explorationwhile maintaining alignment between objectives and yield. The child agent's reward function incorporates quantified Water Stress Factor (WSF) and Nitrogen Stress Factor (NSF), and uses a mixed probability distribution to dynamically optimize daily strategies, thereby enhancing both yield and resource efficiency. We used field experiment data from 2023 and 2024 to calibrate and validate the Decision Support System for Agrotechnology Transfer (DSSAT) to simulate real-world conditions and interact with NDRL. Experimental results demonstrate that, compared to the best baseline, the simulated yield increased by 4.7% in both 2023 and 2024, the irrigation water productivity increased by 5.6% and 5.1% respectively, and the nitrogen partial factor productivity increased by 6.3% and 1.0% respectively.

When partial differential equations are involved, full-order models such as those based on the Finite Element Method can make traditional sampling approaches like Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) computationally infeasible. Although data-driven surrogate models may help reduce evaluation costs, their utility is often limited by the expense of generating high-fidelity data. In contrast, low-fidelity data can be produced more efficiently, although relying on them alone may degrade the accuracy of the inverse UQ solution.\n  To address these challenges, we propose a Multi-Fidelity Delayed Acceptance scheme for Bayesian inverse problems. Extending the Multi-Level Delayed Acceptance framework, the method introduces multi-fidelity neural networks that combine the predictions of solvers of varying fidelity, with high fidelity evaluations restricted to an offline training stage. During the online phase, likelihood evaluations are obtained by evaluating the coarse solvers and passing their outputs to the trained neural networks, thereby avoiding additional high-fidelity simulations.\n  This construction allows heterogeneous coarse solvers to be incorporated consistently within the hierarchy, providing greater flexibility than standard Multi-Level Delayed Acceptance. The proposed approach improves the approximation accuracy of the low fidelity solvers, leading to longer sub-chain lengths, better mixing, and accelerated posterior inference. The effectiveness of the strategy is demonstrated on two benchmark inverse problems involving (i) steady isotropic groundwater flow, (ii) an unsteady reaction-diffusion system, for which substantial computational savings are obtained.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u591a\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u5ef6\u8fdf\u63a5\u53d7\u65b9\u6848\u7528\u4e8e\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u53cd\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u7ed3\u5408\u4e0d\u540c\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u7684\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u5728\u7ebf\u9636\u6bb5\u7684\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u6a21\u62df\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u53cd\u95ee\u9898\u4e2d\u7684\u53c2\u6570\u4f30\u8ba1\u7b49\u4efb\u52a1\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u6602\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u6d89\u53ca\u504f\u5fae\u5206\u65b9\u7a0b\u65f6\uff0c\u6709\u9650\u5143\u7b49\u5168\u9636\u6a21\u578b\u4f7f\u5f97MCMC\u91c7\u6837\u65b9\u6cd5\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e0d\u53ef\u884c\u3002\u867d\u7136\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u4ee3\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u4ee5\u51cf\u5c11\u8bc4\u4f30\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u4f46\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u6570\u636e\u672c\u8eab\u5c31\u5f88\u6602\u8d35\u3002\u4f4e\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u6570\u636e\u751f\u6210\u6548\u7387\u9ad8\uff0c\u4f46\u5355\u72ec\u4f7f\u7528\u4f1a\u964d\u4f4e\u53cd\u95ee\u9898\u6c42\u89e3\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u591a\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u5ef6\u8fdf\u63a5\u53d7\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u6269\u5c55\u591a\u7ea7\u5ef6\u8fdf\u63a5\u53d7\u6846\u67b6\u3002\u65b9\u6cd5\u5f15\u5165\u591a\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4e0d\u540c\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u8bc4\u4f30\u4ec5\u9650\u4e8e\u79bb\u7ebf\u8bad\u7ec3\u9636\u6bb5\u3002\u5728\u7ebf\u9636\u6bb5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8bc4\u4f30\u7c97\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u5e76\u5c06\u5176\u8f93\u51fa\u4f20\u9012\u7ed9\u8bad\u7ec3\u597d\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u6765\u83b7\u5f97\u4f3c\u7136\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u989d\u5916\u7684\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u6a21\u62df\u3002\u8be5\u6784\u9020\u5141\u8bb8\u5728\u5c42\u6b21\u7ed3\u6784\u4e2d\u4e00\u81f4\u5730\u6574\u5408\u5f02\u6784\u7c97\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u4f4e\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u7684\u8fd1\u4f3c\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u66f4\u957f\u7684\u5b50\u94fe\u957f\u5ea6\u3001\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u6027\u548c\u52a0\u901f\u7684\u540e\u9a8c\u63a8\u65ad\u3002\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u53cd\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff1a(i)\u7a33\u6001\u5404\u5411\u540c\u6027\u5730\u4e0b\u6c34\u6d41\uff0c(ii)\u975e\u7a33\u6001\u53cd\u5e94\u6269\u6563\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u83b7\u5f97\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u8282\u7701\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u591a\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u5ef6\u8fdf\u63a5\u53d7\u65b9\u6848\u4e3a\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u53cd\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7075\u6d3b\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u4e0d\u540c\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u7684\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u548c\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u5927\u5e45\u964d\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u6d89\u53ca\u504f\u5fae\u5206\u65b9\u7a0b\u7684\u590d\u6742\u7269\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u3002"}}

However, the lack of effective evaluation methodologies has made it difficult to estimate the risk of bias, making deployment of such systems unsafe in high stakes domains such as consumer finance, where biased decisions can translate directly into regulatory breaches and financial loss. To address this challenge, we need to develop fairness evaluation methodologies for multi-agent predictive systems and measure the fairness characteristics of these systems in the financial tabular domain. Examining fairness metrics using large-scale simulations across diverse multi-agent configurations, with varying communication and collaboration mechanisms, we reveal patterns of emergent bias in financial decision-making that cannot be traced to individual agent components, indicating that multi-agent systems may exhibit genuinely collective behaviors. Our findings highlight that fairness risks in financial multi-agent systems represent a significant component of model risk, with tangible impacts on tasks such as credit scoring and income estimation. We advocate that multi-agent decision systems must be evaluated as holistic entities rather than through reductionist analyses of their constituent components.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u9700\u8981\u4e3a\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u9884\u6d4b\u7cfb\u7edf\u5f00\u53d1\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u91d1\u878d\u8868\u683c\u6570\u636e\u9886\u57df\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6a21\u62df\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u91d1\u878d\u51b3\u7b56\u4e2d\u51fa\u73b0\u7684\u96c6\u4f53\u504f\u89c1\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u504f\u89c1\u65e0\u6cd5\u8ffd\u6eaf\u5230\u5355\u4e2a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7ec4\u4ef6\u3002", "motivation": "\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u867d\u7136\u80fd\u901a\u8fc7\u534f\u4f5c\u51b3\u7b56\u63d0\u5347\u9884\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u6709\u6548\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f7f\u5f97\u96be\u4ee5\u4f30\u8ba1\u504f\u89c1\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u8fd9\u5728\u6d88\u8d39\u8005\u91d1\u878d\u7b49\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u9886\u57df\u5c24\u5176\u5371\u9669\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u504f\u89c1\u51b3\u7b56\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u76d1\u7ba1\u8fdd\u89c4\u548c\u8d22\u52a1\u635f\u5931\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u9884\u6d4b\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u91d1\u878d\u8868\u683c\u6570\u636e\u9886\u57df\u4f7f\u7528\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6a21\u62df\uff0c\u8003\u5bdf\u4e0d\u540c\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u914d\u7f6e\uff08\u5305\u62ec\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u901a\u4fe1\u548c\u534f\u4f5c\u673a\u5236\uff09\u4e0b\u7684\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u6307\u6807\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u91d1\u878d\u51b3\u7b56\u4e2d\u51fa\u73b0\u4e86\u65e0\u6cd5\u8ffd\u6eaf\u5230\u5355\u4e2a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7ec4\u4ef6\u7684\u6d8c\u73b0\u6027\u504f\u89c1\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u53ef\u80fd\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u771f\u6b63\u7684\u96c6\u4f53\u884c\u4e3a\u3002\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u98ce\u9669\u5728\u91d1\u878d\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u662f\u6a21\u578b\u98ce\u9669\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u7ec4\u6210\u90e8\u5206\uff0c\u5bf9\u4fe1\u7528\u8bc4\u5206\u548c\u6536\u5165\u4f30\u8ba1\u7b49\u4efb\u52a1\u6709\u5b9e\u9645\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u51b3\u7b56\u7cfb\u7edf\u5fc5\u987b\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6574\u4f53\u5b9e\u4f53\u8fdb\u884c\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u800c\u4e0d\u662f\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u5176\u7ec4\u6210\u7ec4\u4ef6\u7684\u8fd8\u539f\u4e3b\u4e49\u5206\u6790\u3002\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u98ce\u9669\u4ee3\u8868\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u98ce\u9669\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u90e8\u5206\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

In this work, we formulate the selection of $T$ as a discrete black-box optimization problem, where each function evaluation corresponds to training an LDA model and measuring its validation perplexity. Under a fixed evaluation budget, we compare four families of optimizers: two hand-designed evolutionary methods - Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Evolution Strategy (ES) - and two learned, amortized approaches, Preferential Amortized Black-Box Optimization (PABBO) and Sharpness-Aware Black-Box Optimization (SABBO). Our experiments show that, while GA, ES, PABBO, and SABBO eventually reach a similar band of final perplexity, the amortized optimizers are substantially more sample- and time-efficient. SABBO typically identifies a near-optimal topic number after essentially a single evaluation, and PABBO finds competitive configurations within a few evaluations, whereas GA and ES require almost the full budget to approach the same region.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u5c06LDA\u4e3b\u9898\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4e3b\u9898\u6570\u91cf\u9009\u62e9\u95ee\u9898\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u79bb\u6563\u9ed1\u76d2\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86\u56db\u79cd\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u9a8c\u8bc1\u56f0\u60d1\u5ea6\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u644a\u9500\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6837\u672c\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u6548\u7387\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u8fdb\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "LDA\u4e3b\u9898\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u4e3b\u9898\u6570\u91cfT\u7684\u9009\u62e9\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u8bbe\u8ba1\u51b3\u7b56\uff0c\u5b83\u76f4\u63a5\u5f71\u54cd\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7edf\u8ba1\u62df\u5408\u5ea6\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u4f9d\u8d56\u7ecf\u9a8c\u89c4\u5219\u6216\u7f51\u683c\u641c\u7d22\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7cfb\u7edf\u5316\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u4e3b\u9898\u6570\u91cf\u9009\u62e9\u95ee\u9898\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u4e3a\u79bb\u6563\u9ed1\u76d2\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u6bcf\u6b21\u51fd\u6570\u8bc4\u4f30\u5bf9\u5e94\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e00\u4e2aLDA\u6a21\u578b\u5e76\u8ba1\u7b97\u5176\u9a8c\u8bc1\u56f0\u60d1\u5ea6\u3002\u5728\u56fa\u5b9a\u8bc4\u4f30\u9884\u7b97\u4e0b\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86\u56db\u79cd\u4f18\u5316\u5668\uff1a\u4e24\u79cd\u624b\u5de5\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u8fdb\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u9057\u4f20\u7b97\u6cd5GA\u548c\u8fdb\u5316\u7b56\u7565ES\uff09\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u4e24\u79cd\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u644a\u9500\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u4f18\u5148\u644a\u9500\u9ed1\u76d2\u4f18\u5316PABBO\u548c\u9510\u5ea6\u611f\u77e5\u9ed1\u76d2\u4f18\u5316SABBO\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u867d\u7136\u56db\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u6700\u7ec8\u90fd\u80fd\u8fbe\u5230\u76f8\u4f3c\u7684\u56f0\u60d1\u5ea6\u6c34\u5e73\uff0c\u4f46\u644a\u9500\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6837\u672c\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u6548\u7387\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u66f4\u4f18\u3002SABBO\u901a\u5e38\u5728\u4e00\u6b21\u8bc4\u4f30\u540e\u5c31\u80fd\u8bc6\u522b\u51fa\u63a5\u8fd1\u6700\u4f18\u7684\u4e3b\u9898\u6570\u91cf\uff0cPABBO\u5728\u51e0\u6b21\u8bc4\u4f30\u5185\u5c31\u80fd\u627e\u5230\u6709\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\u7684\u914d\u7f6e\uff0c\u800cGA\u548cES\u9700\u8981\u51e0\u4e4e\u7528\u5c3d\u5168\u90e8\u9884\u7b97\u624d\u80fd\u8fbe\u5230\u76f8\u540c\u533a\u57df\u3002", "conclusion": "\u644a\u9500\u9ed1\u76d2\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728LDA\u4e3b\u9898\u6570\u91cf\u9009\u62e9\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u5353\u8d8a\u7684\u6548\u7387\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662fSABBO\u548cPABBO\u80fd\u591f\u4ee5\u6781\u5c11\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u6b21\u6570\u627e\u5230\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u89e3\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e3a\u6a21\u578b\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u4f18\u5316\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

One of the applications of the IoT is in the field of medicine, which is called the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT). Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia (ALL) is a type of cancer categorized as a hematic disease. It usually begins in the bone marrow due to the overproduction of immature White Blood Cells (WBCs or leukocytes). Since it has a high rate of spread to other body organs, it is a fatal disease if not diagnosed and treated early. Therefore, for identifying cancerous (ALL) cells in medical diagnostic laboratories, blood, as well as bone marrow smears, are taken by pathologists. However, manual examinations face limitations due to human error risk and time-consuming procedures. So, to tackle the mentioned issues, methods based on Artificial Intelligence (AI), capable of identifying cancer from non-cancer tissue, seem vital. Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are the most efficient machine learning (ML) methods. These techniques employ multiple layers to extract higher-level features from the raw input. In this paper, a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is applied along with a new type of classifier, Higher Order Singular Value Decomposition (HOSVD), to categorize ALL and normal (healthy) cells from microscopic blood images. We employed the model on IoMT structure to identify leukemia quickly and safely. With the help of this new leukemia classification framework, patients and clinicians can have real-time communication. The model was implemented on the Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia Image Database (ALL-IDB2) and achieved an average accuracy of %98.88 in the test step.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408CNN\u548cHOSVD\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5728IoMT\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u5feb\u901f\u51c6\u786e\u8bc6\u522b\u6025\u6027\u6dcb\u5df4\u7ec6\u80de\u767d\u8840\u75c5\u7ec6\u80de\uff0c\u5728ALL-IDB2\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fbe\u523098.88%\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u6025\u6027\u6dcb\u5df4\u7ec6\u80de\u767d\u8840\u75c5\uff08ALL\uff09\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u81f4\u547d\u8840\u6db2\u75be\u75c5\uff0c\u65e9\u671f\u8bca\u65ad\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002\u4f20\u7edf\u4eba\u5de5\u68c0\u67e5\u5b58\u5728\u4eba\u4e3a\u9519\u8bef\u98ce\u9669\u4e14\u8017\u65f6\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u57fa\u4e8e\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u8bca\u65ad\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002IoMT\u4e3a\u5b9e\u65f6\u533b\u7597\u76d1\u6d4b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6280\u672f\u57fa\u7840\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u5377\u79ef\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\uff08CNN\uff09\u63d0\u53d6\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u65b0\u578b\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u9ad8\u9636\u5947\u5f02\u503c\u5206\u89e3\uff08HOSVD\uff09\u5bf9ALL\u548c\u6b63\u5e38\u7ec6\u80de\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u7c7b\u3002\u8be5\u6a21\u578b\u90e8\u7f72\u5728IoMT\u67b6\u6784\u4e2d\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5feb\u901f\u5b89\u5168\u7684\u767d\u8840\u75c5\u8bc6\u522b\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6025\u6027\u6dcb\u5df4\u7ec6\u80de\u767d\u8840\u75c5\u56fe\u50cf\u6570\u636e\u5e93\uff08ALL-IDB2\uff09\u4e0a\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6d4b\u8bd5\u9636\u6bb5\u8fbe\u5230\u4e86\u5e73\u574798.88%\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684CNN-HOSVD\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u591f\u51c6\u786e\u8bc6\u522b\u767d\u8840\u75c5\u7ec6\u80de\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408IoMT\u67b6\u6784\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u60a3\u8005\u4e0e\u4e34\u5e8a\u533b\u751f\u7684\u5b9e\u65f6\u901a\u4fe1\uff0c\u4e3a\u65e9\u671f\u767d\u8840\u75c5\u8bca\u65ad\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Detecting clusters in exploratory data analyses (EDA) requires algorithms that make few assumptions about the data. Density-based clustering algorithms are particularly well-suited for EDA because they describe high-density regions, assuming only that a density exists. Applying density-based clustering algorithms in practice, however, requires selecting appropriate hyperparameters, which is difficult without prior knowledge of the data distribution. For example, DBSCAN requires selecting a density threshold, and HDBSCAN* relies on a minimum cluster size parameter. In this work, we propose Persistent Leaves Spatial Clustering for Applications with Noise (PLSCAN). This novel density-based clustering algorithm efficiently identifies all minimum cluster sizes for which HDBSCAN* produces stable (leaf) clusters. PLSCAN applies scale-space clustering principles and is equivalent to persistent homology on a novel metric space.

Meanwhile, current sequential models extract direct sequential signal, missing useful event-counting statistics. We enhance deep sequential models with self-supervised pretraining strategies for display advertising.

SLHF frames the alignment problem as a sequential-move game between two policies: a Leader, which commits to an action, and a Follower, which responds conditionally on the Leader's action. This approach decomposes preference optimization into a refinement problem for the Follower and an optimization problem against an adversary for the Leader. Unlike Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), which assigns scalar rewards to actions, or Nash Learning from Human Feedback (NLHF), which seeks a simultaneous-move equilibrium, SLHF leverages the asymmetry of sequential play to capture richer preference structures. The sequential design of SLHF naturally enables inference-time refinement, as the Follower learns to improve the Leader's actions, and these refinements can be leveraged through iterative sampling. We compare the solution concepts of SLHF, RLHF, and NLHF, and lay out key advantages in consistency, data sensitivity, and robustness to intransitive preferences.

However, practical deployment of deep learning-based RFFI models is hindered by a critical challenge: their performance often degrades significantly when applied across receivers with different hardware characteristics due to distribution shifts introduced by receiver variation. To address this, we investigate the source-data-free cross-receiver RFFI (SCRFFI) problem, where a model pretrained on labeled signals from a source receiver must adapt to unlabeled signals from a target receiver, without access to any source-domain data during adaptation. We first formulate a novel constrained pseudo-labeling-based SCRFFI adaptation framework, and provide a theoretical analysis of its generalization performance. Our analysis highlights a key insight: the target-domain performance is highly sensitive to the quality of the pseudo-labels generated during adaptation. Motivated by this, we propose Momentum Soft pseudo-label Source Hypothesis Transfer (MS-SHOT), a new method for SCRFFI that incorporates momentum-center-guided soft pseudo-labeling and enforces global structural constraints to encourage confident and diverse predictions. Notably, MS-SHOT effectively addresses scenarios involving label shift or unknown, non-uniform class distributions in the target domain -- a significant limitation of prior methods. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that MS-SHOT consistently outperforms existing approaches in both accuracy and robustness, offering a practical and scalable solution for source-data-free cross-receiver adaptation in RFFI.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faMS-SHOT\u65b9\u6cd5\u89e3\u51b3\u65e0\u7ebf\u5c04\u9891\u6307\u7eb9\u8bc6\u522b\u4e2d\u7684\u6e90\u6570\u636e\u7f3a\u5931\u8de8\u63a5\u6536\u5668\u9002\u5e94\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u91cf\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u8f6f\u4f2a\u6807\u7b7e\u548c\u5168\u5c40\u7ed3\u6784\u7ea6\u675f\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u8fb9\u7f18\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e2d\u57fa\u4e8e\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u5c04\u9891\u6307\u7eb9\u8bc6\u522b\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u90e8\u7f72\u65f6\u9762\u4e34\u5173\u952e\u6311\u6218\uff1a\u5f53\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u5177\u6709\u4e0d\u540c\u786c\u4ef6\u7279\u6027\u7684\u63a5\u6536\u5668\u65f6\uff0c\u7531\u4e8e\u63a5\u6536\u5668\u53d8\u5316\u5f15\u5165\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u79fb\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u4f1a\u663e\u8457\u4e0b\u964d\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u9700\u8981\u6e90\u57df\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u4f46\u5b9e\u9645\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u6e90\u6570\u636e\u53ef\u80fd\u4e0d\u53ef\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u9996\u5148\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u7ea6\u675f\u4f2a\u6807\u7b7e\u7684SCRFFI\u9002\u5e94\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5e76\u8fdb\u884c\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u3002\u7136\u540e\u63d0\u51faMS-SHOT\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u52a8\u91cf\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u8f6f\u4f2a\u6807\u7b7e\u548c\u5168\u5c40\u7ed3\u6784\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u9f13\u52b1\u81ea\u4fe1\u4e14\u591a\u6837\u5316\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u5904\u7406\u76ee\u6807\u57df\u4e2d\u7684\u6807\u7b7e\u504f\u79fb\u6216\u975e\u5747\u5300\u7c7b\u522b\u5206\u5e03\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5927\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cMS-SHOT\u5728\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u59cb\u7ec8\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e3aRFFI\u4e2d\u7684\u6e90\u6570\u636e\u7f3a\u5931\u8de8\u63a5\u6536\u5668\u9002\u5e94\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u4e14\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "conclusion": "MS-SHOT\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u6e90\u6570\u636e\u7f3a\u5931\u7684\u8de8\u63a5\u6536\u5668\u5c04\u9891\u6307\u7eb9\u8bc6\u522b\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u548c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u76ee\u6807\u57df\u5b58\u5728\u6807\u7b7e\u504f\u79fb\u6216\u975e\u5747\u5300\u7c7b\u522b\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u573a\u666f\u3002"}}

However, current practices remain dominated by ad-hoc scripts and loosely specified workflows, which lack principled abstractions, hinder reproducibility, and offer limited support for model-in-the-loop data generation. To address these challenges, we present DataFlow, a unified and extensible LLM-driven data preparation framework. DataFlow is designed with system-level abstractions that enable modular, reusable, and composable data transformations, and provides a PyTorch-style pipeline construction API for building debuggable and optimizable dataflows. The framework consists of nearly 200 reusable operators and six domain-general pipelines spanning text, mathematical reasoning, code, Text-to-SQL, agentic RAG, and large-scale knowledge extraction. To further improve usability, we introduce DataFlow-Agent, which automatically translates natural-language specifications into executable pipelines via operator synthesis, pipeline planning, and iterative verification. Across six representative use cases, DataFlow consistently improves downstream LLM performance. Our math, code, and text pipelines outperform curated human datasets and specialized synthetic baselines, achieving up to +3\\% execution accuracy in Text-to-SQL over SynSQL, +7\\% average improvements on code benchmarks, and 1--3 point gains on MATH, GSM8K, and AIME. Moreover, a unified 10K-sample dataset produced by DataFlow enables base models to surpass counterparts trained on 1M Infinity-Instruct data. These results demonstrate that DataFlow provides a practical and high-performance substrate for reliable, reproducible, and scalable LLM data preparation, and establishes a system-level foundation for future data-centric AI development.", "AI": {"tldr": "DataFlow\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u7edf\u4e00\u7684LLM\u9a71\u52a8\u6570\u636e\u51c6\u5907\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u3001\u53ef\u7ec4\u5408\u7684\u6570\u636e\u8f6c\u6362\u62bd\u8c61\u548cPyTorch\u98ce\u683cAPI\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u8fd1200\u4e2a\u53ef\u91cd\u7528\u64cd\u4f5c\u7b26\u548c\u516d\u4e2a\u9886\u57df\u901a\u7528\u7ba1\u9053\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7DataFlow-Agent\u5b9e\u73b0\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u5230\u53ef\u6267\u884c\u7ba1\u9053\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u8f6c\u6362\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347LLM\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524dLLM\u6570\u636e\u51c6\u5907\u5b9e\u8df5\u4e3b\u8981\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e34\u65f6\u811a\u672c\u548c\u677e\u6563\u5b9a\u4e49\u7684\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u539f\u5219\u6027\u62bd\u8c61\u3001\u53ef\u590d\u73b0\u6027\u5dee\uff0c\u4e14\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u73af\u6570\u636e\u751f\u6210\u652f\u6301\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u6ee1\u8db3\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u6570\u636e\u5feb\u901f\u589e\u957f\u7684\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faDataFlow\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u7cfb\u7edf\u7ea7\u62bd\u8c61\u5b9e\u73b0\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u3001\u53ef\u91cd\u7528\u3001\u53ef\u7ec4\u5408\u7684\u6570\u636e\u8f6c\u6362\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9bPyTorch\u98ce\u683c\u7ba1\u9053\u6784\u5efaAPI\u3002\u5305\u542b\u8fd1200\u4e2a\u53ef\u91cd\u7528\u64cd\u4f5c\u7b26\u548c\u516d\u4e2a\u9886\u57df\u901a\u7528\u7ba1\u9053\uff08\u6587\u672c\u3001\u6570\u5b66\u63a8\u7406\u3001\u4ee3\u7801\u3001Text-to-SQL\u3001\u4ee3\u7406RAG\u3001\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u77e5\u8bc6\u63d0\u53d6\uff09\u3002\u5f15\u5165DataFlow-Agent\u901a\u8fc7\u64cd\u4f5c\u7b26\u5408\u6210\u3001\u7ba1\u9053\u89c4\u5212\u548c\u8fed\u4ee3\u9a8c\u8bc1\u81ea\u52a8\u5c06\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u89c4\u8303\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u53ef\u6267\u884c\u7ba1\u9053\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u516d\u4e2a\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u7528\u4f8b\u4e2d\uff0cDataFlow\u6301\u7eed\u63d0\u5347\u4e0b\u6e38LLM\u6027\u80fd\uff1a\u6570\u5b66\u3001\u4ee3\u7801\u548c\u6587\u672c\u7ba1\u9053\u4f18\u4e8e\u4eba\u5de5\u7b56\u5212\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u4e13\u7528\u5408\u6210\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0cText-to-SQL\u6267\u884c\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u6bd4SynSQL\u63d0\u9ad8+3%\uff0c\u4ee3\u7801\u57fa\u51c6\u5e73\u5747\u63d0\u53477%\uff0cMATH\u3001GSM8K\u548cAIME\u83b7\u5f971-3\u5206\u63d0\u5347\u3002\u7edf\u4e00\u768410K\u6837\u672c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4f7f\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u8d85\u8fc7\u4f7f\u75281M Infinity-Instruct\u6570\u636e\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u5bf9\u5e94\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "conclusion": "DataFlow\u4e3a\u53ef\u9760\u3001\u53ef\u590d\u73b0\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684LLM\u6570\u636e\u51c6\u5907\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u672a\u6765\u4ee5\u6570\u636e\u4e3a\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684AI\u5f00\u53d1\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u7ea7\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

The paper also explores the effect of text representations such as TF-IDF, the Universal Sentence Encoder (USE), and RoBERTa. Additionally, various feature extraction techniques, including Chi-Square, Mutual Information, and Principal Component Analysis, are explored. Building on these, we introduce a comparative analysis of the machine learning and deep learning approaches in comparison to the NeSy.

These tasks demand different levels of annotation granularity but are frequently constrained by the scarcity of region-level (dense) annotations. We introduce CLARiTy (Class Localizing and Attention Refining Image Transformer), a vision transformer-based model for joint multi-label classification and weakly-supervised localization of thoracic pathologies. CLARiTy employs multiple class-specific tokens to generate discriminative attention maps, and a SegmentCAM module for foreground segmentation and background suppression using explicit anatomical priors. Trained on image-level labels from the NIH ChestX-ray14 dataset, it leverages distillation from a ConvNeXtV2 teacher for efficiency. Evaluated on the official NIH split, the CLARiTy-S-16-512 (a configuration of CLARiTy), achieves competitive classification performance across 14 pathologies, and state-of-the-art weakly-supervised localization performance on 8 pathologies, outperforming prior methods by 50.7%. In particular, pronounced gains occur for small pathologies like nodules and masses. The lower-resolution variant of CLARiTy, CLARiTy-S-16-224, offers high efficiency while decisively surpassing baselines, thereby having the potential for use in low-resource settings. An ablation study confirms contributions of SegmentCAM, DINO pretraining, orthogonal class token loss, and attention pooling. CLARiTy advances beyond CNN-ViT hybrids by harnessing ViT self-attention for global context and class-specific localization, refined through convolutional background suppression for precise, noise-reduced heatmaps.", "AI": {"tldr": "CLARiTy\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c6\u89c9Transformer\u7684\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u80f8\u90e8X\u5149\u7247\u7684\u591a\u6807\u7b7e\u5206\u7c7b\u548c\u5f31\u76d1\u7763\u5b9a\u4f4d\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7c7b\u7279\u5b9atoken\u548cSegmentCAM\u6a21\u5757\u5b9e\u73b0\u7cbe\u786e\u7684\u75c5\u7406\u5b9a\u4f4d\uff0c\u5728NIH ChestX-ray14\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u5f31\u76d1\u7763\u5b9a\u4f4d\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u80f8\u90e8X\u5149\u7247\u89e3\u8bfb\u9762\u4e34\u591a\u6807\u7b7e\u75c5\u7406\u5206\u7c7b\u548c\u7a7a\u95f4\u5b9a\u4f4d\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u901a\u5e38\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u533a\u57df\u7ea7\uff08\u5bc6\u96c6\uff09\u6807\u6ce8\u7684\u7a00\u7f3a\u6027\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u591f\u540c\u65f6\u5904\u7406\u4e0d\u540c\u6807\u6ce8\u7c92\u5ea6\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "CLARiTy\u91c7\u7528\u89c6\u89c9Transformer\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u591a\u4e2a\u7c7b\u7279\u5b9atoken\u751f\u6210\u533a\u5206\u6027\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u56fe\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408SegmentCAM\u6a21\u5757\u8fdb\u884c\u524d\u666f\u5206\u5272\u548c\u80cc\u666f\u6291\u5236\uff08\u5229\u7528\u89e3\u5256\u5148\u9a8c\u77e5\u8bc6\uff09\u3002\u4f7f\u7528ConvNeXtV2\u6559\u5e08\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u84b8\u998f\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u6548\u7387\u3002", "result": "\u5728NIH ChestX-ray14\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cCLARiTy-S-16-512\u572814\u79cd\u75c5\u7406\u5206\u7c7b\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97\u7ade\u4e89\u6027\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u57288\u79cd\u75c5\u7406\u7684\u5f31\u76d1\u7763\u5b9a\u4f4d\u4e0a\u8fbe\u5230\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u6c34\u5e73\uff0c\u6bd4\u5148\u524d\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u534750.7%\u3002\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5bf9\u5c0f\u75c5\u7406\uff08\u5982\u7ed3\u8282\u548c\u80bf\u5757\uff09\u6709\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u3002\u4f4e\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u53d8\u4f53CLARiTy-S-16-224\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u6548\u7387\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u4e5f\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e86\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "CLARiTy\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e86CNN-ViT\u6df7\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5229\u7528ViT\u81ea\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u83b7\u53d6\u5168\u5c40\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u548c\u7c7b\u7279\u5b9a\u5b9a\u4f4d\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5377\u79ef\u80cc\u666f\u6291\u5236\u8fdb\u884c\u7cbe\u70bc\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u7cbe\u786e\u3001\u964d\u566a\u7684\u70ed\u529b\u56fe\uff0c\u5728\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u5177\u6709\u5e94\u7528\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

This paper presents an AI model for a phishing detection system that uses an ensemble approach to combine character-level Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and LightGBM with engineered features. Our system uses a character-level CNN to extract sequential features after extracting 36 lexical, structural, and domain-based features from the URLs. On a test dataset of 19,873 URLs, the ensemble model achieves an accuracy of 99.819 percent, precision of 100 percent, recall of 99.635 percent, and ROC-AUC of 99.947 percent. Through a FastAPI-based service with an intuitive user interface, the suggested system has been utilised to offer real-time detection. In contrast, the results demonstrate that the suggested solution performs better than individual models; LightGBM contributes 40 percent and character-CNN contributes 60 percent to the final prediction. The suggested method maintains extremely low false positive rates while doing a good job of identifying contemporary phishing techniques.

However, these mechanisms lack theoretical grounding and cannot support context-aware selection from latent state dynamics. To address these limitations, we propose KOSS, a Kalman-optimal Selective State Space model that formulates selection as latent state uncertainty minimization. Derived from estimation theory, KOSS adopts a continuous-time latent update driven by a Kalman gain that dynamically modulates information propagation based on content and context, enabling a closed-loop, context-aware selectivity mechanism. To ensure stable computation and near-linear scalability, KOSS employs global spectral differentiation for frequency-domain derivative estimation, along with a segment-wise scan for hardware-efficient processing. On a selective copying task with distractors, KOSS achieves over 79\\% accuracy while baselines drop below 20\\%, demonstrating robust context-aware selection. Furthermore, across nine long-term forecasting benchmarks, KOSS reduces MSE by 2.92--36.23\\% and consistently outperforms state-of-the-art models in both accuracy and stability. To assess real-world applicability, a case study on secondary surveillance radar (SSR) tracking confirms KOSS's robustness under irregular intervals and noisy conditions and demonstrates its effectiveness in real-world applications. Finally, supplementary experiments verify Kalman gain convergence and the frequency response of spectral differentiation, providing theoretical support for the proposed closed-loop design.", "AI": {"tldr": "KOSS\uff1a\u57fa\u4e8e\u5361\u5c14\u66fc\u6700\u4f18\u9009\u62e9\u7684\u72b6\u6001\u7a7a\u95f4\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u9009\u62e9\u673a\u5236\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u6f5c\u5728\u72b6\u6001\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5185\u5bb9\u4e0e\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u95ed\u73af\u9009\u62e9\uff0c\u5728\u957f\u5e8f\u5217\u5efa\u6a21\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u72b6\u6001\u7a7a\u95f4\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u5982Mamba\u3001Mamba-2\uff09\u7684\u9009\u62e9\u673a\u5236\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7406\u8bba\u4f9d\u636e\uff0c\u4e14\u65e0\u6cd5\u652f\u6301\u57fa\u4e8e\u6f5c\u5728\u72b6\u6001\u52a8\u6001\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u611f\u77e5\u9009\u62e9\u3002\u9700\u8981\u5efa\u7acb\u7406\u8bba\u652f\u6491\u7684\u9009\u62e9\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5185\u5bb9\u4e0e\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u4fe1\u606f\u4f20\u64ad\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faKOSS\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5c06\u9009\u62e9\u673a\u5236\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u4e3a\u6f5c\u5728\u72b6\u6001\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u4f30\u8ba1\u7406\u8bba\u63a8\u5bfc\u51fa\u7531\u5361\u5c14\u66fc\u589e\u76ca\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u8fde\u7eed\u65f6\u95f4\u6f5c\u5728\u72b6\u6001\u66f4\u65b0\u3002\u91c7\u7528\u5168\u5c40\u8c31\u5fae\u5206\u8fdb\u884c\u9891\u57df\u5bfc\u6570\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5206\u6bb5\u626b\u63cf\u5b9e\u73b0\u786c\u4ef6\u9ad8\u6548\u5904\u7406\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u590d\u5236\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8fbe\u523079%\u4ee5\u4e0a\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff08\u57fa\u7ebf\u4f4e\u4e8e20%\uff09\uff1b\u57289\u4e2a\u957f\u671f\u9884\u6d4b\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\uff0cMSE\u964d\u4f4e2.92-36.23%\uff1b\u5728\u4e8c\u6b21\u76d1\u89c6\u96f7\u8fbe\u8ddf\u8e2a\u6848\u4f8b\u4e2d\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5728\u975e\u89c4\u5219\u95f4\u9694\u548c\u566a\u58f0\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "KOSS\u901a\u8fc7\u7406\u8bba\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u95ed\u73af\u9009\u62e9\u673a\u5236\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5185\u5bb9\u4e0e\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u4fe1\u606f\u4f20\u64ad\uff0c\u5728\u5e8f\u5217\u5efa\u6a21\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4f18\u8d8a\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u72b6\u6001\u7a7a\u95f4\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u652f\u6491\u3002"}}

The experimental results indicate that the SVM algorithm achieves the highest performance with an accuracy of 92.3%, a precision of 91.5%, and an F1-score of 92.0%. Detailed feature analysis reveals that specific keywords related to legality and high-risk permissions (e.g., READ PHONE STATE) are the most significant discriminators.

Examples include the human brain, living cells, soft matter, Earth's climate, ecosystems, and the economy. These systems exhibit high-dimensional, non-linear dynamics, making their modelling, classification, and prediction particularly challenging. Advances in information technology have enabled data-driven approaches to studying such systems. However, the sheer volume and complexity of spatio-temporal data often hinder traditional methods like dimensionality reduction, phase-space reconstruction, and attractor characterisation. This paper introduces a geometric framework for analysing spatio-temporal data from complex systems, grounded in the theory of vector fields over discrete measure spaces. We propose a two-parameter family of metrics suitable for data analysis and machine learning applications. The framework supports time-dependent images, image gradients, and real- or vector-valued functions defined on graphs and simplicial complexes. We validate our approach using data from numerical simulations of biological and physical systems on flat and curved domains. Our results show that the proposed metrics, combined with multidimensional scaling, effectively address key analytical challenges. They enable dimensionality reduction, mode decomposition, phase-space reconstruction, and attractor characterisation. Our findings offer a robust pathway for understanding complex dynamical systems, especially in contexts where traditional modelling is impractical but abundant experimental data are available.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u79bb\u6563\u6d4b\u5ea6\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e0a\u5411\u91cf\u573a\u7406\u8bba\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5206\u6790\u590d\u6742\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u65f6\u7a7a\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53cc\u53c2\u6570\u5ea6\u91cf\u65cf\u5b9e\u73b0\u964d\u7ef4\u3001\u6a21\u6001\u5206\u89e3\u3001\u76f8\u7a7a\u95f4\u91cd\u6784\u548c\u5438\u5f15\u5b50\u8868\u5f81\u3002", "motivation": "\u590d\u6742\u7cfb\u7edf\uff08\u5982\u5927\u8111\u3001\u7ec6\u80de\u3001\u6c14\u5019\u3001\u7ecf\u6d4e\u7b49\uff09\u5177\u6709\u9ad8\u7ef4\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u5efa\u6a21\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u5904\u7406\u3002\u867d\u7136\u4fe1\u606f\u6280\u672f\u5e26\u6765\u4e86\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f46\u65f6\u7a7a\u6570\u636e\u7684\u5e9e\u5927\u548c\u590d\u6742\u6027\u963b\u788d\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u964d\u7ef4\u3001\u76f8\u7a7a\u95f4\u91cd\u6784\u548c\u5438\u5f15\u5b50\u8868\u5f81\u6280\u672f\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u79bb\u6563\u6d4b\u5ea6\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e0a\u7684\u5411\u91cf\u573a\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u51e0\u4f55\u5206\u6790\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u6570\u636e\u5206\u6790\u548c\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u5e94\u7528\u7684\u53cc\u53c2\u6570\u5ea6\u91cf\u65cf\u3002\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u652f\u6301\u65f6\u95f4\u76f8\u5173\u56fe\u50cf\u3001\u56fe\u50cf\u68af\u5ea6\u4ee5\u53ca\u5b9a\u4e49\u5728\u56fe\u548c\u5355\u7eaf\u590d\u5f62\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u503c\u6216\u5411\u91cf\u503c\u51fd\u6570\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5e73\u9762\u548c\u66f2\u9762\u57df\u4e0a\u7684\u751f\u7269\u548c\u7269\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\u6570\u503c\u6a21\u62df\u6570\u636e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e2d\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u5ea6\u91cf\u7ed3\u5408\u591a\u7ef4\u7f29\u653e\u6280\u672f\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u5173\u952e\u5206\u6790\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u964d\u7ef4\u3001\u6a21\u6001\u5206\u89e3\u3001\u76f8\u7a7a\u95f4\u91cd\u6784\u548c\u5438\u5f15\u5b50\u8868\u5f81\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u590d\u6742\u52a8\u529b\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7a33\u5065\u9014\u5f84\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u5efa\u6a21\u4e0d\u5207\u5b9e\u9645\u4f46\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6570\u636e\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u4e3a\u590d\u6742\u7cfb\u7edf\u5206\u6790\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

Prefix caching partially alleviates some of these costs by reusing KV cache for previously processed tokens, but limited by strict prefix matching. Position-independent caching (PIC) enables chunk-level reuse at arbitrary positions, but requires selective recomputation and positional-encoding (PE) adjustments. However, because these operations vary across queries, KV for the same chunk diverges across requests. Moreover, without page alignment, chunk KV layouts diverge in memory, preventing page sharing. These issues result in only modest HBM savings even when many requests reuse the same content.\n  We present MEPIC, a memory-efficient PIC system that enables chunk KV reuse across positions, requests, and batches. MEPIC aligns chunk KV to paged storage, shifts recomputation from token- to block-level so only the first block is request-specific, removes positional encodings via Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) fusion in the attention kernel, and makes remaining blocks fully shareable. These techniques eliminate most duplicate chunk KV in HBM, reducing usage by up to 2x over state-of-the-art PIC at comparable latency and accuracy, and up to 5x for long prompts, without any model changes.", "AI": {"tldr": "MEPIC\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u5185\u5b58\u9ad8\u6548\u7684KV\u7f13\u5b58\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u9875\u5bf9\u9f50\u3001\u5757\u7ea7\u91cd\u8ba1\u7b97\u548cRoPE\u878d\u5408\u7b49\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u8de8\u4f4d\u7f6e\u3001\u8bf7\u6c42\u548c\u6279\u6b21\u7684\u5757\u7ea7KV\u91cd\u7528\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11HBM\u5185\u5b58\u4f7f\u7528\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u4ee3LLM\u5e94\u7528\uff08\u5982\u6df1\u5ea6\u7814\u7a76\u52a9\u624b\u3001\u7f16\u7801\u4ee3\u7406\u548cRAG\u7cfb\u7edf\uff09\u9700\u8981\u53cd\u590d\u5904\u7406\u5305\u542b\u5171\u4eab\u6587\u6863\u6216\u4ee3\u7801\u5757\u7684\u957f\u63d0\u793a\u5386\u53f2\uff0c\u8fd9\u7ed9KV\u7f13\u5b58\u5e26\u6765\u5de8\u5927\u538b\u529b\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u524d\u7f00\u7f13\u5b58\u548c\u4f4d\u7f6e\u65e0\u5173\u7f13\u5b58\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5373\u4f7f\u8bb8\u591a\u8bf7\u6c42\u91cd\u7528\u76f8\u540c\u5185\u5bb9\uff0cHBM\u5185\u5b58\u8282\u7701\u4e5f\u6709\u9650\u3002", "method": "1. \u5c06\u5757KV\u5bf9\u9f50\u5230\u5206\u9875\u5b58\u50a8\uff1b2. \u5c06\u91cd\u8ba1\u7b97\u4ecetoken\u7ea7\u8f6c\u79fb\u5230\u5757\u7ea7\uff0c\u53ea\u6709\u7b2c\u4e00\u4e2a\u5757\u662f\u8bf7\u6c42\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\uff1b3. \u901a\u8fc7\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5185\u6838\u4e2d\u7684RoPE\u878d\u5408\u79fb\u9664\u4f4d\u7f6e\u7f16\u7801\uff1b4. \u4f7f\u5269\u4f59\u5757\u5b8c\u5168\u53ef\u5171\u4eab\u3002", "result": "MEPIC\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u76f8\u5f53\u5ef6\u8fdf\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684PIC\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5c06HBM\u4f7f\u7528\u51cf\u5c11\u9ad8\u8fbe2\u500d\uff1b\u5bf9\u4e8e\u957f\u63d0\u793a\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u9ad8\u8fbe5\u500d\uff0c\u4e14\u65e0\u9700\u4efb\u4f55\u6a21\u578b\u66f4\u6539\u3002", "conclusion": "MEPIC\u901a\u8fc7\u521b\u65b0\u7684\u5185\u5b58\u4f18\u5316\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86LLM\u5e94\u7528\u4e2dKV\u7f13\u5b58\u7684\u5185\u5b58\u6548\u7387\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u8de8\u4f4d\u7f6e\u3001\u8bf7\u6c42\u548c\u6279\u6b21\u7684\u5757\u7ea7\u91cd\u7528\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5185\u5b58\u5229\u7528\u7387\u3002"}}

For embedded aerospace systems with strict power and latency constraints, this scaling is prohibitive. We present Tiny Recursive Control (TRC), a neural architecture based on a counterintuitive principle: capacity can emerge from iteration depth rather than parameter count. TRC applies compact networks (approximately 1.5M parameters) repeatedly through a two-level hierarchical latent structure, refining control sequences by simulating trajectories and correcting based on tracking error. Because the same weights process every refinement step, adding iterations increases computation without increasing memory. We evaluate TRC on nonlinear control problems including oscillator stabilization and powered descent with fuel constraints. Across these domains, TRC achieves near-optimal control costs while requiring only millisecond-scale inference on GPU and under 10~MB memory, two orders of magnitude smaller than language model baselines. These results demonstrate that recursive reasoning, previously confined to discrete tasks, transfers effectively to continuous control synthesis.", "AI": {"tldr": "TRC\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u9012\u5f52\u8fed\u4ee3\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u63a7\u5236\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6df1\u5ea6\u8fed\u4ee3\u800c\u975e\u53c2\u6570\u6570\u91cf\u6765\u63d0\u5347\u63a7\u5236\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u5c0f\u53c2\u6570\u89c4\u6a21\uff08\u7ea61.5M\uff09\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u63a5\u8fd1\u6700\u4f18\u7684\u63a7\u5236\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u9700\u8981\u6570\u767e\u4e07\u751a\u81f3\u6570\u5341\u4ebf\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u8fd9\u5bf9\u4e8e\u6709\u4e25\u683c\u529f\u8017\u548c\u5ef6\u8fdf\u9650\u5236\u7684\u5d4c\u5165\u5f0f\u822a\u7a7a\u822a\u5929\u7cfb\u7edf\u6765\u8bf4\u662f\u4e0d\u53ef\u884c\u7684\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u65e2\u80fd\u4fdd\u6301\u5c0f\u53c2\u6570\u89c4\u6a21\u53c8\u80fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u63a7\u5236\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faTiny Recursive Control (TRC)\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\"\u80fd\u529b\u53ef\u4ee5\u4ece\u8fed\u4ee3\u6df1\u5ea6\u800c\u975e\u53c2\u6570\u6570\u91cf\u4e2d\u6d8c\u73b0\"\u7684\u539f\u5219\u3002\u4f7f\u7528\u7d27\u51d1\u7f51\u7edc\uff08\u7ea61.5M\u53c2\u6570\uff09\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u7ea7\u5206\u5c42\u6f5c\u5728\u7ed3\u6784\u91cd\u590d\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u62df\u8f68\u8ff9\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u8ddf\u8e2a\u8bef\u5dee\u6821\u6b63\u6765\u7ec6\u5316\u63a7\u5236\u5e8f\u5217\u3002\u76f8\u540c\u6743\u91cd\u5904\u7406\u6bcf\u4e2a\u7ec6\u5316\u6b65\u9aa4\uff0c\u589e\u52a0\u8fed\u4ee3\u53ea\u589e\u52a0\u8ba1\u7b97\u800c\u4e0d\u589e\u52a0\u5185\u5b58\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u63a7\u5236\u95ee\u9898\uff08\u5305\u62ec\u632f\u8361\u5668\u7a33\u5b9a\u548c\u5e26\u71c3\u6599\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u52a8\u529b\u4e0b\u964d\uff09\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30TRC\u3002\u5728\u6240\u6709\u9886\u57df\u90fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u63a5\u8fd1\u6700\u4f18\u7684\u63a7\u5236\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u5728GPU\u4e0a\u4ec5\u9700\u6beb\u79d2\u7ea7\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u95f4\uff0c\u5185\u5b58\u4f7f\u7528\u4f4e\u4e8e10MB\uff0c\u6bd4\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u57fa\u7ebf\u5c0f\u4e24\u4e2a\u6570\u91cf\u7ea7\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9012\u5f52\u63a8\u7406\uff08\u4e4b\u524d\u4ec5\u9650\u4e8e\u79bb\u6563\u4efb\u52a1\uff09\u53ef\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u5730\u8f6c\u79fb\u5230\u8fde\u7eed\u63a7\u5236\u5408\u6210\u4e2d\uff0c\u4e3a\u5d4c\u5165\u5f0f\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u53c2\u6570\u6548\u7387\u9ad8\u3001\u8ba1\u7b97\u8f7b\u91cf\u7684\u63a7\u5236\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

In this paper, we present LaMer, a general Meta-RL framework that enables LLM agents to actively explore and learn from the environment feedback at test time. LaMer consists of two key components: (i) a cross-episode training framework to encourage exploration and long-term rewards optimization; and (ii) in-context policy adaptation via reflection, allowing the agent to adapt their policy from task feedback signal without gradient update. Experiments across diverse environments show that LaMer significantly improves performance over RL baselines, with 11%, 14%, and 19% performance gains on Sokoban, MineSweeper and Webshop, respectively. Moreover, LaMer also demonstrates better generalization to more challenging or previously unseen tasks compared to the RL-trained agents.

To address this, Online Edge ML allows models to be trained directly on edge devices and updated continuously with new data. This paper explores a key challenge of Online Edge ML: \"How to determine labels for truly future, unseen data points\". We propose Knowledge Transformation (KT), a hybrid method combining Knowledge Distillation, Active Learning, and causal reasoning. In short, KT acts as the oracle in active learning by transforming knowledge from a teacher model to generate pseudo-labels for training a student model. To verify the validity of the method, we conducted simulation experiments with two setups: (1) using a less stable teacher model and (2) a relatively more stable teacher model. Results indicate that when a stable teacher model is given, the student model can eventually reach its expected maximum performance. KT is potentially beneficial for scenarios that meet the following circumstances: (1) when the teacher's task is generic, which means existing pre-trained models might be adequate for its task, so there will be no need to train the teacher model from scratch; and/or (2) when the label for the student's task is difficult or expensive to acquire.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u77e5\u8bc6\u8f6c\u6362\uff08KT\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u3001\u4e3b\u52a8\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u56e0\u679c\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u4e3a\u5728\u7ebf\u8fb9\u7f18\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u672a\u89c1\u6570\u636e\u751f\u6210\u4f2a\u6807\u7b7e\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u8fb9\u7f18\u8bbe\u5907\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u6807\u6ce8\u96be\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u8fb9\u7f18\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u5047\u8bbe\u9759\u6001\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e2d\u5fc3\u8bad\u7ec3\u540e\u90e8\u7f72\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u5904\u7406\u672a\u89c1\u6570\u636e\u3002\u5728\u7ebf\u8fb9\u7f18\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u5141\u8bb8\u6a21\u578b\u76f4\u63a5\u5728\u8fb9\u7f18\u8bbe\u5907\u4e0a\u8bad\u7ec3\u5e76\u6301\u7eed\u66f4\u65b0\uff0c\u4f46\u9762\u4e34\u5982\u4f55\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u672a\u89c1\u6570\u636e\u786e\u5b9a\u6807\u7b7e\u7684\u5173\u952e\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u77e5\u8bc6\u8f6c\u6362\uff08KT\uff09\u6df7\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u3001\u4e3b\u52a8\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u56e0\u679c\u63a8\u7406\u3002KT\u5728\u4e3b\u52a8\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u5145\u5f53\u9884\u8a00\u673a\uff0c\u5c06\u6559\u5e08\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u5b66\u751f\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4f2a\u6807\u7b7e\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u79cd\u8bbe\u7f6e\u7684\u6a21\u62df\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff1a1\uff09\u4f7f\u7528\u4e0d\u592a\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u6559\u5e08\u6a21\u578b\uff1b2\uff09\u4f7f\u7528\u76f8\u5bf9\u66f4\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u6559\u5e08\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5f53\u63d0\u4f9b\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u6559\u5e08\u6a21\u578b\u65f6\uff0c\u5b66\u751f\u6a21\u578b\u6700\u7ec8\u80fd\u8fbe\u5230\u9884\u671f\u6700\u5927\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "KT\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4ee5\u4e0b\u573a\u666f\u5177\u6709\u6f5c\u5728\u4f18\u52bf\uff1a1\uff09\u6559\u5e08\u4efb\u52a1\u901a\u7528\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u8db3\u4ee5\u5b8c\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u4ece\u5934\u8bad\u7ec3\u6559\u5e08\u6a21\u578b\uff1b2\uff09\u5b66\u751f\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u6807\u7b7e\u96be\u4ee5\u83b7\u53d6\u6216\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u6602\u3002"}}

Moussa", "Aroosa Hameed", "Arashmid Akhavain"], "title": "Sequencing to Mitigate Catastrophic Forgetting in Continual Learning", "comment": "The Manuscript is submitted for review under IEEE Transactions on Artificial intelligence", "summary": "To cope with real-world dynamics, an intelligent system needs to incrementally acquire, update, and exploit knowledge throughout its lifetime. This ability, known as Continual learning, provides a foundation for AI systems to develop themselves adaptively. Catastrophic forgetting is a major challenge to the progress of Continual Learning approaches, where learning a new task usually results in a dramatic performance drop on previously learned ones. Many approaches have emerged to counteract the impact of CF. Most of the proposed approaches can be categorized into five classes: replay-based, regularization-based, optimization-based, representation-based, and architecture-based. In this work, we approach the problem from a different angle, specifically by considering the optimal sequencing of tasks as they are presented to the model. We investigate the role of task sequencing in mitigating CF and propose a method for determining the optimal task order. The proposed method leverages zero-shot scoring algorithms inspired by neural architecture search (NAS). Results demonstrate that intelligent task sequencing can substantially reduce CF. Moreover, when combined with traditional continual learning strategies, sequencing offers enhanced performance and robustness against forgetting. Additionally, the presented approaches can find applications in other fields, such as curriculum learning.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u901a\u8fc7\u667a\u80fd\u4efb\u52a1\u6392\u5e8f\u6765\u7f13\u89e3\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u707e\u96be\u6027\u9057\u5fd8\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u8bc4\u5206\u7b97\u6cd5\u786e\u5b9a\u6700\u4f18\u4efb\u52a1\u987a\u5e8f\uff0c\u5e76\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u7ed3\u5408\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u7cfb\u7edf\u9700\u8981\u5728\u6574\u4e2a\u751f\u547d\u5468\u671f\u4e2d\u589e\u91cf\u83b7\u53d6\u3001\u66f4\u65b0\u548c\u5229\u7528\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u4f46\u707e\u96be\u6027\u9057\u5fd8\uff08\u5b66\u4e60\u65b0\u4efb\u52a1\u5bfc\u81f4\u65e7\u4efb\u52a1\u6027\u80fd\u6025\u5267\u4e0b\u964d\uff09\u662f\u4e3b\u8981\u6311\u6218\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5927\u591a\u5173\u6ce8\u6a21\u578b\u5185\u90e8\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u4ece\u4efb\u52a1\u6392\u5e8f\u89d2\u5ea6\u63a2\u7d22\u7f13\u89e3\u9057\u5fd8\u7684\u65b0\u9014\u5f84\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u8bc4\u5206\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u6392\u5e8f\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7075\u611f\u6765\u81ea\u795e\u7ecf\u67b6\u6784\u641c\u7d22\uff08NAS\uff09\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u667a\u80fd\u786e\u5b9a\u4efb\u52a1\u5448\u73b0\u987a\u5e8f\u6765\u4f18\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u5e76\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edf\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u5982\u57fa\u4e8e\u56de\u653e\u3001\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u3001\u4f18\u5316\u3001\u8868\u793a\u548c\u67b6\u6784\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff09\u7ed3\u5408\u4f7f\u7528\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u667a\u80fd\u4efb\u52a1\u6392\u5e8f\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u707e\u96be\u6027\u9057\u5fd8\u3002\u5f53\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edf\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u7b56\u7565\u7ed3\u5408\u65f6\uff0c\u80fd\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u6297\u9057\u5fd8\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4efb\u52a1\u6392\u5e8f\u662f\u7f13\u89e3\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u707e\u96be\u6027\u9057\u5fd8\u7684\u6709\u6548\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u4e3a\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u4ef7\u503c\u7684\u8865\u5145\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u8fd8\u53ef\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u8bfe\u7a0b\u5b66\u4e60\u7b49\u5176\u4ed6\u9886\u57df\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u4efb\u52a1\u987a\u5e8f\u4f18\u5316\u5728\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u9002\u7528\u6027\u3002"}}

These models, trained on extant data from various sources, can be conceptualized as historical artifacts that encode decades-old attitudes and stereotypes. This paper investigates one such example trained on the broadly-used New York Times Annotated Corpus to create a multi-label classifier. Our use in research settings surfaced the concerning \"blacks\" thematic topic label. Through quantitative and qualitative means we investigate this label's use in the training corpus, what concepts it might be encoding in the trained classifier, and how those concepts impact our model use. Via the application of explainable AI methods, we find that the \"blacks\" label operates partially as a general \"racism detector\" across some minoritized groups. However, it performs poorly against expectations on modern examples such as COVID-19 era anti-Asian hate stories, and reporting on the Black Lives Matter movement. This case study of interrogating embedded biases in a model reveals how similar applications in newsroom settings can lead to unexpected outputs that could impact a wide variety of potential uses of any large language model-story discovery, audience targeting, summarization, etc. The fundamental tension this exposes for newsrooms is how to adopt AI-enabled workflow tools while reducing the risk of reproducing historical biases in news coverage.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u5206\u6790\u300a\u7ebd\u7ea6\u65f6\u62a5\u300b\u8bed\u6599\u5e93\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684AI\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u4e2d\"blacks\"\u6807\u7b7e\u7684\u504f\u89c1\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u8be5\u6807\u7b7e\u90e8\u5206\u4f5c\u4e3a\"\u79cd\u65cf\u4e3b\u4e49\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\"\u8fd0\u4f5c\uff0c\u4f46\u5bf9\u73b0\u4ee3\u79cd\u65cf\u8bae\u9898\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u65b0\u95fb\u4e1a\u91c7\u7528AI\u5de5\u5177\u65f6\u9762\u4e34\u7684\u5386\u53f2\u504f\u89c1\u98ce\u9669\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740AI\u6280\u672f\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u65b0\u95fb\u7814\u7a76\u548c\u65b0\u95fb\u7f16\u8f91\u5ba4\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u57fa\u4e8e\u5386\u53f2\u6570\u636e\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u80fd\u7f16\u7801\u4e86\u8fc7\u65f6\u7684\u6001\u5ea6\u548c\u523b\u677f\u5370\u8c61\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u8c03\u67e5\u300a\u7ebd\u7ea6\u65f6\u62a5\u300b\u8bed\u6599\u5e93\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u4e2d\"blacks\"\u6807\u7b7e\u7684\u504f\u89c1\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63ed\u793aAI\u5de5\u5177\u5728\u65b0\u95fb\u4e1a\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u53ef\u80fd\u590d\u73b0\u5386\u53f2\u504f\u89c1\u7684\u98ce\u9669\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u300a\u7ebd\u7ea6\u65f6\u62a5\u300b\u6807\u6ce8\u8bed\u6599\u5e93\u8bad\u7ec3\u591a\u6807\u7b7e\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9a\u91cf\u548c\u5b9a\u6027\u65b9\u6cd5\u5206\u6790\"blacks\"\u6807\u7b7e\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u8bed\u6599\u4e2d\u7684\u4f7f\u7528\u60c5\u51b5\uff0c\u5e94\u7528\u53ef\u89e3\u91caAI\u65b9\u6cd5\u63a2\u7a76\u8be5\u6807\u7b7e\u5728\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u4e2d\u7f16\u7801\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u5e76\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5176\u5728\u73b0\u4ee3\u79cd\u65cf\u8bae\u9898\uff08\u5982COVID-19\u53cd\u4e9a\u88d4\u4ec7\u6068\u62a5\u9053\u548cBLM\u8fd0\u52a8\u62a5\u9053\uff09\u4e0a\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\"blacks\"\u6807\u7b7e\u90e8\u5206\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8de8\u5c11\u6570\u7fa4\u4f53\u7684\"\u79cd\u65cf\u4e3b\u4e49\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\"\u8fd0\u4f5c\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u73b0\u4ee3\u79cd\u65cf\u8bae\u9898\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff1a\u65e0\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u8bc6\u522bCOVID-19\u65f6\u671f\u7684\u53cd\u4e9a\u88d4\u4ec7\u6068\u62a5\u9053\uff0c\u5bf9BLM\u8fd0\u52a8\u7684\u62a5\u9053\u5904\u7406\u4e5f\u5b58\u5728\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u8fd9\u8868\u660e\u57fa\u4e8e\u5386\u53f2\u8bed\u6599\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u80fd\u65e0\u6cd5\u9002\u5e94\u73b0\u4ee3\u8bed\u5883\u3002", "conclusion": "\u65b0\u95fb\u7f16\u8f91\u5ba4\u5728\u91c7\u7528AI\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u5de5\u5177\u65f6\u9762\u4e34\u6839\u672c\u6027\u5f20\u529b\uff1a\u5982\u4f55\u5728\u5229\u7528AI\u6548\u7387\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u51cf\u5c11\u590d\u73b0\u5386\u53f2\u504f\u89c1\u7684\u98ce\u9669\u3002\u6848\u4f8b\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u7c7b\u4f3c\u5e94\u7528\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u610f\u5916\u8f93\u51fa\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u6545\u4e8b\u53d1\u73b0\u3001\u53d7\u4f17\u5b9a\u4f4d\u3001\u6458\u8981\u751f\u6210\u7b49\u591a\u79cd\u7528\u9014\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u8c28\u614e\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u5e72\u9884\u3002"}}

This finetuning step has proved critical in achieving human or super-human performance, yet while much attention has been given to developing more effective finetuning algorithms, little attention has been given to ensuring the pretrained policy is an effective initialization for RL finetuning. In this work we seek to understand how the pretrained policy affects finetuning performance, and how to pretrain policies in order to ensure they are effective initializations for finetuning. We first show theoretically that standard behavioral cloning (BC) -- which trains a policy to directly match the actions played by the demonstrator -- can fail to ensure coverage over the demonstrator's actions, a minimal condition necessary for effective RL finetuning. We then show that if, instead of exactly fitting the observed demonstrations, we train a policy to model the posterior distribution of the demonstrator's behavior given the demonstration dataset, we do obtain a policy that ensures coverage over the demonstrator's actions, enabling more effective finetuning. Furthermore, this policy -- which we refer to as the posterior behavioral cloning (PostBC) policy -- achieves this while ensuring pretrained performance is no worse than that of the BC policy. We then show that PostBC is practically implementable with modern generative models in robotic control domains -- relying only on standard supervised learning -- and leads to significantly improved RL finetuning performance on both realistic robotic control benchmarks and real-world robotic manipulation tasks, as compared to standard behavioral cloning.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faPostBC\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5efa\u6a21\u6f14\u793a\u8005\u7684\u540e\u9a8c\u5206\u5e03\u6765\u6539\u8fdb\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u4e3aRL\u5fae\u8c03\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u521d\u59cb\u5316\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u6807\u51c6\u884c\u4e3a\u514b\u9686\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u5fae\u8c03\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u5b9e\u8df5\u4e2d\uff0c\u901a\u5e38\u5148\u5728\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6f14\u793a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u901a\u8fc7RL\u5fae\u8c03\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u867d\u7136\u5fae\u8c03\u7b97\u6cd5\u5f97\u5230\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u4f46\u5982\u4f55\u786e\u4fdd\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\u662fRL\u5fae\u8c03\u7684\u6709\u6548\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u5374\u5173\u6ce8\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002\u6807\u51c6\u884c\u4e3a\u514b\u9686\u53ef\u80fd\u65e0\u6cd5\u8986\u76d6\u6f14\u793a\u8005\u7684\u6240\u6709\u52a8\u4f5c\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u540e\u7eedRL\u5fae\u8c03\u6548\u679c\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u540e\u9a8c\u884c\u4e3a\u514b\u9686\uff08PostBC\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e0d\u76f4\u63a5\u62df\u5408\u89c2\u5bdf\u5230\u7684\u6f14\u793a\u52a8\u4f5c\uff0c\u800c\u662f\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\u6765\u5efa\u6a21\u6f14\u793a\u8005\u884c\u4e3a\u5728\u6f14\u793a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0b\u7684\u540e\u9a8c\u5206\u5e03\u3002\u8fd9\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ec5\u9700\u6807\u51c6\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u53ef\u57fa\u4e8e\u73b0\u4ee3\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u5b9e\u73b0\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u8986\u76d6\u6f14\u793a\u8005\u7684\u52a8\u4f5c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e0eBC\u76f8\u5f53\u7684\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "result": "\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u8868\u660e\u6807\u51c6BC\u53ef\u80fd\u65e0\u6cd5\u8986\u76d6\u6f14\u793a\u8005\u52a8\u4f5c\uff0c\u800cPostBC\u80fd\u786e\u4fdd\u8fd9\u79cd\u8986\u76d6\u3002\u5728\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u63a7\u5236\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u64cd\u4f5c\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0cPostBC\u76f8\u6bd4\u6807\u51c6BC\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347RL\u5fae\u8c03\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "PostBC\u4e3aRL\u5fae\u8c03\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u7684\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5efa\u6a21\u6f14\u793a\u8005\u540e\u9a8c\u5206\u5e03\u786e\u4fdd\u52a8\u4f5c\u8986\u76d6\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u540e\u7eed\u5fae\u8c03\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u53ef\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u63a7\u5236\u9886\u57df\u3002"}}

Exploitation: Rethinking RLVR through Clipping, Entropy, and Spurious Reward", "comment": "35 pages", "summary": "This paper examines the exploration-exploitation trade-off in reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR), a framework for improving the reasoning of Large Language Models (LLMs). Recent studies suggest that RLVR can elicit strong mathematical reasoning in LLMs through two seemingly paradoxical mechanisms: spurious rewards, which suppress exploitation by rewarding outcomes unrelated to the ground truth, and entropy minimization, which suppresses exploration by pushing the model toward more confident and deterministic outputs, highlighting a puzzling dynamic: both discouraging exploitation and discouraging exploration improve reasoning performance, yet the underlying principles that reconcile these effects remain poorly understood. We focus on two fundamental questions: (i) how policy entropy relates to performance, and (ii) whether spurious rewards yield gains, potentially through the interplay of clipping bias and model contamination. Our results show that clipping bias under spurious rewards reduces policy entropy, leading to more confident and deterministic outputs, while entropy minimization alone is insufficient for improvement. We further propose a reward-misalignment model explaining why spurious rewards can enhance performance beyond contaminated settings. Our findings clarify the mechanisms behind spurious-reward benefits and provide principles for more effective RLVR training.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5956\u52b1\uff08RLVR\uff09\u6846\u67b6\u4e2d\u7684\u63a2\u7d22-\u5229\u7528\u6743\u8861\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u865a\u5047\u5956\u52b1\u548c\u71b5\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u5982\u4f55\u901a\u8fc7\u770b\u4f3c\u77db\u76fe\u7684\u673a\u5236\u63d0\u5347\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6570\u5b66\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u6700\u8fd1\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0cRLVR\u53ef\u4ee5\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u79cd\u770b\u4f3c\u77db\u76fe\u7684\u673a\u5236\u6fc0\u53d1\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6570\u5b66\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff1a\u865a\u5047\u5956\u52b1\uff08\u901a\u8fc7\u5956\u52b1\u4e0e\u771f\u5b9e\u7ed3\u679c\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\u6765\u6291\u5236\u5229\u7528\uff09\u548c\u71b5\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\uff08\u901a\u8fc7\u63a8\u52a8\u6a21\u578b\u4ea7\u751f\u66f4\u81ea\u4fe1\u548c\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u7684\u8f93\u51fa\u6765\u6291\u5236\u63a2\u7d22\uff09\u3002\u8fd9\u4e24\u79cd\u673a\u5236\u90fd\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u63a8\u7406\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u80cc\u540e\u7684\u539f\u7406\u5c1a\u4e0d\u6e05\u695a\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u805a\u7126\u4e24\u4e2a\u57fa\u672c\u95ee\u9898\uff1a(1)\u7b56\u7565\u71b5\u4e0e\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\uff1b(2)\u865a\u5047\u5956\u52b1\u662f\u5426\u901a\u8fc7\u88c1\u526a\u504f\u5dee\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u6c61\u67d3\u7684\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u4ea7\u751f\u6536\u76ca\u3002\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u5956\u52b1\u9519\u914d\u6a21\u578b\u6765\u89e3\u91ca\u865a\u5047\u5956\u52b1\u5728\u6c61\u67d3\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e4b\u5916\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "result": "\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u865a\u5047\u5956\u52b1\u4e0b\u7684\u88c1\u526a\u504f\u5dee\u4f1a\u964d\u4f4e\u7b56\u7565\u71b5\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u66f4\u81ea\u4fe1\u548c\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u7684\u8f93\u51fa\uff0c\u800c\u5355\u72ec\u7684\u71b5\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u4e0d\u8db3\u4ee5\u5e26\u6765\u6539\u8fdb\u3002\u5956\u52b1\u9519\u914d\u6a21\u578b\u89e3\u91ca\u4e86\u865a\u5047\u5956\u52b1\u5982\u4f55\u5728\u975e\u6c61\u67d3\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e2d\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u9610\u660e\u4e86\u865a\u5047\u5956\u52b1\u83b7\u76ca\u7684\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u4e3a\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u7684RLVR\u8bad\u7ec3\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u539f\u5219\u3002\u865a\u5047\u5956\u52b1\u901a\u8fc7\u88c1\u526a\u504f\u5dee\u964d\u4f4e\u7b56\u7565\u71b5\uff0c\u800c\u71b5\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u672c\u8eab\u4e0d\u8db3\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u7ed3\u5408\u5956\u52b1\u9519\u914d\u673a\u5236\u6765\u7406\u89e3\u865a\u5047\u5956\u52b1\u7684\u589e\u76ca\u6548\u5e94\u3002"}}
