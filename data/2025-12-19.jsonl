Artificial networks typically replicate this via recurrent or parallel architectures, yet incur high energy costs and noise sensitivity. Here we report IPNet, a hardware-software co-designed neuromorphic architecture realizing human-like working memory via neuronal intrinsic plasticity. Exploiting Joule-heating dynamics of Magnetic Tunnel Junctions (MTJs), IPNet physically emulates biological memory volatility. The memory behavior of the proposed architecture shows similar trends in n-back, free recall and memory interference tasks to that of reported human subjects. Implemented exclusively with MTJ neurons, the architecture with human-like working memory achieves 99.65% accuracy on 11-class DVS gesture datasets and maintains 99.48% on a novel 22-class time-reversed benchmark, outperforming RNN, LSTM, and 2+1D CNN baselines sharing identical backbones. For autonomous driving (DDD-20), IPNet reduces steering prediction error by 14.4% compared to ResNet-LSTM. Architecturally, we identify a 'Memory-at-the-Frontier' effect where performance is maximized at the sensing interface, validating a bio-plausible near-sensor processing paradigm. Crucially, all results rely on raw parameters from fabricated devices without optimization. Hardware-in-the-loop validation confirms the system's physical realizability. Separately, energy analysis reveals a reduction in memory power of 2,874x compared to LSTMs and 90,920x versus parallel 3D-CNNs. This capacitor-free design enables a compact ~1.5um2 footprint (28 nm CMOS): a >20-fold reduction over standard LIF neurons. Ultimately, we demonstrate that instantiating human-like working memory via intrinsic neuronal plasticity endows neural networks with the dual biological advantages of superior dynamic vision processing and minimal metabolic cost."}

However, most existing technologies for measuring Pb are labor-intensive and costly. In this study, we propose SoilScanner, a radio frequency-based wireless system that can detect Pb in soils. This is based on our discovery that the propagation of different frequency band radio signals is affected differently by different salts such as NaCl and Pb(NO3)2 in the soil. In a controlled experiment, manually adding NaCl and Pb(NO3)2 in clean soil, we demonstrated that different salts reflected signals at different frequencies in distinct patterns. In addition, we confirmed the finding using uncontrolled field samples with a machine learning model. Our experiment results show that SoilScanner can classify soil samples into low-Pb and high-Pb categories (threshold at 200 ppm) with an accuracy of 72%, with no sample with > 500 ppm of Pb being misclassified. The results of this study show that it is feasible to build portable and affordable Pb detection and screening devices based on wireless technology."}

Branch prediction is a pattern recognition problem that learns mappings between a context to the branch outcome.

In this paper, we present a workload characterization methodology for branch prediction. We propose two new workload-driven branch prediction accuracy identifiers -- branch working set size and branch predictability. These parameters are highly correlated with misprediction rates of modern branch prediction schemes (e.g. TAGE and perceptron). We define the branch working set of a trace as a group of most frequently occurring branch contexts, i.e. the 3-part tuple of branch address, and associated global and local history. We analyze the branch working set's size and predictability on a per-trace basis to study its relationship with a modern branch predictor's accuracy. We have characterized 2,451 workload traces into seven branch working set size and nine predictability categories after analyzing their branch behavior. We present further insights into the source of prediction accuracy and favored workload categories for modern branch predictors."}

These devices will sense an egocentric view of the world around us to observe all human- relevant signals across space and time to construct and maintain a user's personal context. This personal context, combined with advanced generative AI, will unlock a powerful new generation of contextual AI personal assistants and applications. However, designing a wearable system to support contextual AI is a daunting task because of the system's complexity and stringent power constraints due to weight and battery restrictions. To understand how to guide design for such systems, this work provides the first complete system architecture view of one such wearable contextual AI system (Aria2), along with the lessons we have learned through the system modeling and design space exploration process. We show that an end-to-end full system model view of such systems is vitally important, as no single component or category overwhelmingly dominates system power. This means long-range design decisions and power optimizations need to be made in the full system context to avoid running into limits caused by other system bottlenecks (i.e., Amdahl's law as applied to power) or as bottlenecks change. Finally, we reflect on lessons and insights for the road ahead, which will be important toward eventually enabling all-day, wearable, contextual AI systems."}

These \"setup times\" can wreak havoc on a system's queueing; this is especially true in modern systems, where servers are regularly turned on and off as a way to reduce operating costs (energy, labor, CO2, etc.). To design modern systems which are both efficient and performant, we need to understand how setup times affect queues.\n  Unfortunately, despite successes in understanding setup in a single-server system, setup in a multiserver system remains poorly understood. To circumvent the main difficulty in analyzing multiserver setup, all existing results assume that setup times are memoryless, i.e. distributed Exponentially. However, in most practical settings, setup times are close to Deterministic, and the widely used Exponential-setup assumption leads to unrealistic model behavior and a dramatic underestimation of the true harm caused by setup times.\n  This paper provides a comprehensive characterization of the average waiting time in a multiserver system with Deterministic setup times, the M/M/k/Setup-Deterministic. In particular, we derive upper and lower bounds on the average waiting time in this system, and show these bounds are within a multiplicative constant of each other. These bounds are the first closed-form characterization of waiting time in any finite-server system with setup times. Further, we demonstrate how to combine our upper and lower bounds to derive a simple and accurate approximation for the average waiting time. These results are all made possible via a new technique for analyzing random time integrals that we named the Method of Intervening Stopping Times, or MIST."}

It is tailored for serverless scalable architectures and uses a log-based rollback recovery protocol. LOG.io supports a general programming model, accommodating non-deterministic operators, interactions with external systems, and arbitrary custom code. It is non-blocking, allowing failed operators to recover independently without interrupting other active operators, thereby leveraging data parallelization, and it facilitates dynamic scaling of operators during pipeline execution. Performance evaluations, conducted within the SAP Data Intelligence system, compare LOG.io with the Asynchronous Barrier Snapshotting (ABS) protocol, originally implemented in Flink. Our experiments show that when there are straggler operators in a data pipeline and the throughput of events is moderate (e.g., 1 event every 100 ms), LOG.io performs as well as ABS during normal processing and outperforms ABS during recovery. Otherwise, ABS performs better than LOG.io for both normal processing and recovery. However, we show that in these cases, data parallelization can largely reduce the overhead of LOG.io while ABS does not improve. Finally, we show that the overhead of data lineage capture, at the granularity of the event and between any two operators in a pipeline, is marginal, with less than 1.5% in all our experiments."}

Prior work focused on first-generation AIE kernel optimizations, without tackling full neural network execution across the 2D array. In this work, we present AIE4ML, the first comprehensive framework for converting AI models automatically into optimized firmware targeting the AIE-ML generation devices, also with forward compatibility for the newer AIE-MLv2 architecture. At the single-kernel level, we attain performance close to the architectural peak. At the graph and system levels, we provide a structured parallelization method that can scale across the 2D AIE-ML fabric and exploit its dedicated memory tiles to stay entirely on-chip throughout the model execution. As a demonstration, we designed a generalized and highly efficient linear-layer implementation with intrinsic support for fused bias addition and ReLU activation. Also, as our framework necessitates the generation of multi-layer implementations, our approach systematically derives deterministic, compact, and topology-optimized placements tailored to the physical 2D grid of the device through a novel graph placement and search algorithm. Finally, the framework seamlessly accepts quantized models imported from high-level tools such as hls4ml or PyTorch while preserving bit-exactness. In layer scaling benchmarks, we achieve up to 98.6% efficiency relative to the single-kernel baseline, utilizing 296 of 304 AIE tiles (97.4%) of the device with entirely on-chip data movement. With evaluations across real-world model topologies, we demonstrate that AIE4ML delivers GPU-class throughput under microsecond latency constraints, making it a practical companion for ultra-low-latency environments such as trigger systems in particle physics experiments."}

Motivated by the demand for real-time situational awareness and intelligent operational maintenance, digital twin (DT) technology was initially regarded as a promising solution, owing to its capability to create virtual replicas and emulate physical system behaviors. However, in the context of SAGSIN, the high-fidelity, full-scale modeling paradigm inherent to conventional DTs encounters fundamental limitations, including prohibitive computational overhead, delayed model synchronization, and cross-system semantic gaps. To address these limitations, this survey paper proposes a novel twinning framework: goal-oriented semantic twin (GOST). Unlike DTs that pursue physical mirroring, GOST prioritizes ``utility'' over ``fidelity,'' leveraging semantic technologies and goal-oriented principles to construct lightweight, task-specific representations. This paper systematically articulates the GOST framework through three layers: knowledge-based semantics, data-driven semantics, and goal-oriented principles. Furthermore, we provide a comprehensive tutorial on constructing GOST by detailing its core enabling technologies and introduce a multidimensional evaluation framework for GOST. We present a case study targeting collaborative tracking tasks in remote satellite-UAV networks, demonstrating that GOST significantly outperforms conventional DTs in timeliness of perceptual data and collaborative tracking.

However, recent studies highlight the importance of high-frequency signals. The role of low-frequency and high-frequency graph signals in recommendation remains unclear. This paper aims to bridge this gap by investigating the influence of graph signals on recommendation performance. We theoretically prove that the effects of low-frequency and high-frequency graph signals are equivalent in recommendation tasks, as both contribute by smoothing the similarities between user-item pairs. To leverage this insight, we propose a frequency signal scaler, a plug-and-play module that adjusts the graph signal filter function to fine-tune the smoothness between user-item pairs, making it compatible with any GNN model. Additionally, we identify and prove that graph embedding-based methods cannot fully capture the characteristics of graph signals. To address this limitation, a space flip method is introduced to restore the expressive power of graph embeddings. Remarkably, we demonstrate that either low-frequency or high-frequency graph signals alone are sufficient for effective recommendations.

Second, GPU fragmentation becomes a critical issue, which is different from prior fine-grained GPU sharing work due to MIG's limited number of valid MIG configurations. Fragmentation arises not only from spatial discontinuity but also from rigid profile placement constraints, especially after job arrivals and terminations. To address these issues, we propose an online scheduling framework that integrates conditional load balancing, dynamic partitioning, and job migration.

Multimodal models such as CLIP have been able to perform well on this task by learning semantic similarities across vision and language; however, despite these advances, image classification is still a challenging task. Models with low capacity often suffer from underfitting and thus underperform on fine-grained image classification. Along with this, it is important to ensure high-quality data with rich cross-modal representations of each class, which is often difficult to generate. When datasets do not enforce balanced demographics, the predictions will be biased toward the more represented class, while others will be neglected. We focus on how these issues can lead to harmful bias for zero-shot image classification, and explore how to combat these issues in demographic bias. We propose Diverse Demographic Data Generation (D3G), a training-free, zero-shot method of boosting classification accuracy while reducing demographic bias in pre-trained multimodal models. With this method, we utilize CLIP as our base multimodal model and Stable Diffusion XL as our generative model. We demonstrate that providing diverse demographic data at inference time improves performance for these models, and explore the impact of individual demographics on the resulting accuracy metric."}

To ensure atomic and consistent data access on DM, distributed transaction systems have been adapted, where compute nodes (CNs) rely on one-sided RDMA operations to access remote data in memory nodes (MNs). However, we observe that in existing transaction systems, the RDMA network interface cards at MNs become a primary performance bottleneck. This bottleneck arises from the high volume of one-sided atomic operations used for locks, which hinders the system's ability to scale efficiently.\n  To address this issue, this paper presents Lotus, a scalable distributed transaction system with lock disaggregation on DM. The key innovation of Lotus is to disaggregate locks from data and execute all locks on CNs, thus eliminating the bottleneck at MN RNICs. To achieve efficient lock management on CNs, Lotus employs an application-aware lock management mechanism that leverages the locality of the OLTP workloads to shard locks while maintaining load balance. To ensure consistent transaction processing with lock disaggregation, Lotus introduces a lock-first transaction protocol, which separates the locking phase as the first step in each read-write transaction execution. This protocol allows the system to determine the success of lock acquisitions early and proactively abort conflicting transactions, improving overall efficiency. To tolerate lock loss during CN failures, Lotus employs a lock-rebuild-free recovery mechanism that treats locks as ephemeral and avoids their reconstruction, ensuring lightweight recovery for CN failures. Experimental results demonstrate that Lotus improves transaction throughput by up to 2.1$\\times$ and reduces latency by up to 49.4% compared to state-of-the-art transaction systems on DM."}

Training a machine-learned model for VSR typically requires vast amounts of annotated images. Yet, species-level annotation demands domain expertise, making it realistic for domain experts to annotate only a few examples. These limited labeled data motivate training an ''expert'' model via few-shot learning (FSL). Meanwhile, advanced Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have demonstrated prominent performance on general recognition tasks. It is straightforward to ask whether LMMs excel in the highly specialized VSR task and whether they outshine FSL expert models. Somewhat surprisingly, we find that LMMs struggle in this task, despite using various established prompting techniques. LMMs even significantly underperform FSL expert models, which are as simple as finetuning a pretrained visual encoder on the few-shot images. However, our in-depth analysis reveals that LMMs can effectively post-hoc correct the expert models' incorrect predictions. Briefly, given a test image, when prompted with the top predictions from an FSL expert model, LMMs can recover the ground-truth label. Building on this insight, we derive a simple method called Post-hoc Correction (POC), which prompts an LMM to re-rank the expert model's top predictions using enriched prompts that include softmax confidence scores and few-shot visual examples. Across five challenging VSR benchmarks, POC outperforms prior art of FSL by +6.4% in accuracy without extra training, validation, or manual intervention. Importantly, POC generalizes to different pretrained backbones and LMMs, serving as a plug-and-play module to significantly enhance existing FSL methods."}

Building on DM, memory-disaggregated key-value (KV) stores are adopted to efficiently manage remote data. Unfortunately, existing approaches suffer from poor performance due to two critical issues: 1) the overdependence on one-sided atomic operations in index processing, and 2) the constrained efficiency in compute-side caches. To address these issues, we propose FlexKV, a memory-disaggregated KV store with index proxying. Our key idea is to dynamically offload the index to compute nodes, leveraging their powerful CPUs to accelerate index processing and maintain high-performance compute-side caches. Three challenges have to be addressed to enable efficient index proxying on DM, i.e., the load imbalance across compute nodes, the limited memory of compute nodes, and the expensive cache coherence overhead. FlexKV proposes: 1) a rank-aware hotness detection algorithm to continuously balance index load across compute nodes, 2) a two-level CN memory optimization scheme to efficiently utilize compute node memory, and 3) an RPC-aggregated cache management mechanism to reduce cache coherence overhead.

The machine learning literature provides ample analysis with respect to the mechanisms to which linearity is induced. However, the analysis of extrapolation at the origin under the NTK regime remains a more unexplored special case. In particular, the infinite-dimensional feature map induced by the neural tangent kernel is not translationally invariant. This means that the study of an out-of-distribution evaluation point very far from the origin is not equivalent to the evaluation of a point very near the origin. And since the feature map is rotation invariant, these two special cases may represent the most canonically extreme bounds of ReLU NTK extrapolation. Ultimately, it is this loose recognition of the two special cases of extrapolation that motivate the discovery of quadratic extrapolation for an evaluation close to the origin."}

One of the critical challenges is the continuous emergence of new applications, which generates Out-of-Distribution (OOD) traffic patterns that deviate from known categories and are not well represented by predefined models. Current approaches rely on predefined categories, which limits their effectiveness in handling unknown traffic types. Although some methods mitigate this limitation by simply classifying unknown traffic into a single \"Other\" category, they fail to make a fine-grained classification. In this paper, we propose a Two-stage Adaptive OOD classification Network (TAO-Net) that achieves accurate classification for both In-Distribution (ID) and OOD encrypted traffic. The method incorporates an innovative two-stage design: the first stage employs a hybrid OOD detection mechanism that integrates transformer-based inter-layer transformation smoothness and feature analysis to effectively distinguish between ID and OOD traffic, while the second stage leverages large language models with a novel semantic-enhanced prompt strategy to transform OOD traffic classification into a generation task, enabling flexible fine-grained classification without relying on predefined labels. Experiments on three datasets demonstrate that TAO-Net achieves 96.81-97.70% macro-precision and 96.77-97.68% macro-F1, outperforming previous methods that only reach 44.73-86.30% macro-precision, particularly in identifying emerging network applications."}

The framework specifically involves: (i) deployment of new servers combined with capacity upgrades for existing servers, and (ii) the optimal task offloading to maximize the average number of tasks with a delay requirement. It also considers the following constraints: (i) budget per stage, (ii) server deployment and upgrade cost (in $) and cost depreciation rate, (iii) computation resource of servers, (iv) number of tasks and their growth rate (in %), and (v) the increase in task sizes and stricter delay requirements over time. We present two solutions: a Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) model and an efficient heuristic algorithm (M-ESU/H). MILP yields the optimal solution for small networks, whereas M-ESU/H is used in large-scale networks. For small networks, the simulation results show that the solution computed by M-ESU/H is within 1.25% of the optimal solution while running several orders of magnitude faster. For large networks, M-ESU/H is compared against three alternative heuristic solutions that consider only server deployment, or giving priority to server deployment or upgrade.

This limitation reflects an incomplete understanding of how specific flow features contribute to thrombus initiation and growth. This study introduces an interpretable machine learning framework for spatial thrombosis assessment based directly on computational fluid dynamics-derived flow features. A logistic regression (LR) model combined with a structured feature-selection pipeline is used to derive a compact and physically interpretable feature set, including nonlinear feature combinations. The framework is trained using spatial risk patterns from a validated, macro-scale thrombosis model for two representative scenarios. The model reproduces the labeled risk distributions and identifies distinct sets of flow features associated with increased thrombosis risk. When applied to a centrifugal pump, despite training on a single axial pump operating point, the model predicts plausible thrombosis-prone regions. These results show that interpretable machine learning can link local flow features to thrombosis risk while remaining computationally efficient and mechanistically transparent. The low computational cost enables rapid thrombogenicity screening without repeated or costly simulations. The proposed framework complements physics-based thrombosis modeling and provides a methodological basis for integrating interpretable machine learning into CFD-driven thrombosis analysis and device design workflows."}

While test-time adaptation (TTA) offers a promising approach for personalized prediction, the rarity of IOH events often leads to unreliable test-time training. To address this, we propose CSA-TTA, a novel Cross-Sample Augmented Test-Time Adaptation framework that enhances training by incorporating hypotension events from other individuals. Specifically, we first construct a cross-sample bank by segmenting historical data into hypotensive and non-hypotensive samples. Then, we introduce a coarse-to-fine retrieval strategy for building test-time training data: we initially apply K-Shape clustering to identify representative cluster centers and subsequently retrieve the top-K semantically similar samples based on the current patient signal. Additionally, we integrate both self-supervised masked reconstruction and retrospective sequence forecasting signals during training to enhance model adaptability to rapid and subtle intraoperative dynamics. We evaluate the proposed CSA-TTA on both the VitalDB dataset and a real-world in-hospital dataset by integrating it with state-of-the-art time series forecasting models, including TimesFM and UniTS. CSA-TTA consistently enhances performance across settings-for instance, on VitalDB, it improves Recall and F1 scores by +1.33% and +1.13%, respectively, under fine-tuning, and by +7.46% and +5.07% in zero-shot scenarios-demonstrating strong robustness and generalization."}

Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods such as LoRA reduce this cost by adding small low-rank updates to frozen model weights. However, these methods restrict the training to a limited subspace, which can sometimes reduce performance.\n  For Small Language Models (SLMs), where efficiency gains matter even more, we introduce AdaGradSelect, an adaptive method that selects which transformer blocks to update based on gradients.\n  Early observations showed that updating only the transformer blocks with the highest gradient norms can achieve performance close to full fine-tuning. Building on this insight, AdaGradSelect adaptively chooses which blocks to train. It uses a combination of Dirichlet-based sampling, which depends on how frequently blocks were updated in the past, and an epsilon-greedy exploration strategy. This lets the method explore different blocks in early training and gradually focus on the most important ones in later epochs.\n  Experiments show that AdaGradSelect trains about 12 percent faster and uses 35 percent less GPU memory while delivering performance very close to full fine-tuning. On the GSM8K dataset, it outperforms LoRA (rank 256) by about 3 percent on average across models such as Qwen2.5-0.5B, LLaMA3.2-1B, and Phi4-mini-3.8B.

While some training data is publicly available, substantial investment is required to generate proprietary datasets, such as human preference annotations or to curate new ones from existing sources. As larger datasets generally yield better model performance, two natural questions arise. First, how can data owners make informed decisions about curation strategies and data sources investment? Second, how can multiple data owners collaboratively pool their resources to train superior models while fairly distributing the benefits? This problem, data valuation, which is not specific to large language models, has been addressed by the machine learning community through the lens of cooperative game theory, with the Shapley value being the prevalent solution concept. However, computing Shapley values is notoriously expensive for data valuation, typically requiring numerous model retrainings, which can become prohibitive for large machine learning models. In this work, we demonstrate that this computational challenge is dramatically simplified for LLMs trained with Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). We show how the specific mathematical structure of DPO enables scalable Shapley value computation. We believe this observation unlocks many applications at the intersection of data valuation and large language models."}

However, these models often exhibit discrepancies from the reality due to unmodeled effects or simplifying assumptions. We refer to this gap as the ignorance model. While purely data-driven approaches attempt to learn full system behavior, they require large amounts of high-quality data across the entire spatial and temporal domain. In real-world scenarios, such information is unavailable, making full data-driven modeling unreliable. To overcome this limitation, we model of the ignorance component using a hybrid twin approach, instead of simulating phenomena from scratch. Since physics-based models approximate the overall behavior of the phenomena, the remaining ignorance is typically lower in complexity than the full physical response, therefore, it can be learned with significantly fewer data. A key difficulty, however, is that spatial measurements are sparse, also obtaining data measuring the same phenomenon for different spatial configurations is challenging in practice. Our contribution is to overcome this limitation by using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to represent the ignorance model. GNNs learn the spatial pattern of the missing physics even when the number of measurement locations is limited. This allows us to enrich the physics-based model with data-driven corrections without requiring dense spatial, temporal and parametric data. To showcase the performance of the proposed method, we evaluate this GNN-based hybrid twin on nonlinear heat transfer problems across different meshes, geometries, and load positions. Results show that the GNN successfully captures the ignorance and generalizes corrections across spatial configurations, improving simulation accuracy and interpretability, while minimizing data requirements."}

In this work, we extend the Time-Evolving Natural Gradient (TENG) framework to address Dirichlet boundary conditions, integrating natural gradient optimization with numerical time-stepping schemes, including Euler and Heun methods, to ensure both stability and accuracy. By incorporating boundary condition penalty terms into the loss function, the proposed approach enables precise enforcement of Dirichlet constraints.

The temporal complexity of embodied tasks demands a dynamic and adaptable computation mode. Static and lossy acceleration methods, such as quantization, fail to handle such dynamic embodied tasks, while speculative decoding offers a lossless and adaptive yet underexplored alternative for DP. However, it is non-trivial to address the following challenges: how to match the base model's denoising quality at lower cost under time-varying task difficulty in embodied settings, and how to dynamically and interactively adjust computation based on task difficulty in such environments. In this paper, we propose Temporal-aware Reinforcement-based Speculative Diffusion Policy (TS-DP), the first framework that enables speculative decoding for DP with temporal adaptivity. First, to handle dynamic environments where task difficulty varies over time, we distill a Transformer-based drafter to imitate the base model and replace its costly denoising calls. Second, an RL-based scheduler further adapts to time-varying task difficulty by adjusting speculative parameters to maintain accuracy while improving efficiency. Extensive experiments across diverse embodied environments demonstrate that TS-DP achieves up to 4.17 times faster inference with over 94% accepted drafts, reaching an inference frequency of 25 Hz and enabling real-time diffusion-based control without performance degradation."}

Recent work proposed the isolation kernel as an alternative, yet it may not optimally capture sequence similarities. In this study, we comprehensively evaluate nine different kernel functions for t-SNE applied to molecular sequences, using three embedding methods: One-Hot Encoding, Spike2Vec, and minimizers. Through both subjective visualization and objective metrics (including neighborhood preservation scores), we demonstrate that the cosine similarity kernel in general outperforms other kernels, including Gaussian and isolation kernels, achieving superior runtime efficiency and better preservation of pairwise distances in low-dimensional space. We further validate our findings through extensive classification and clustering experiments across six diverse biological datasets (Spike7k, Host, ShortRead, Rabies, Genome, and Breast Cancer), employing multiple machine learning algorithms and evaluation metrics.

Despite their shared goal, these models have disparate algorithms, theoretical structures, and tradeoffs: discrete diffusion has the most natural domain, Gaussian diffusion has more mature algorithms, and diffusion on the simplex in principle combines the strengths of the other two but in practice suffers from a numerically unstable stochastic processes. Ideally we could see each of these models as instances of the same underlying framework, and enable practitioners to switch between models for downstream applications. However previous theories have only considered connections in special cases. Here we build a theory unifying all three methods of discrete diffusion as different parameterizations of the same underlying process: the Wright-Fisher population genetics model. In particular, we find simplicial and Gaussian diffusion as two large-population limits. Our theory formally connects the likelihoods and hyperparameters of these models and leverages decades of mathematical genetics literature to unlock stable simplicial diffusion. Finally, we relieve the practitioner of balancing model trade-offs by demonstrating it is possible to train a single model that can perform diffusion in any of these three domains at test time. Our experiments show that Wright-Fisher simplicial diffusion is more stable and outperforms previous simplicial diffusion models on conditional DNA generation. We also show that we can train models on multiple domains at once that are competitive with models trained on any individual domain."}

Yet, VLM decisions are influenced by the perceived demographic attributes of people in the input, which can lead to biased outcomes like failing to identify women as doctors. Moreover, when reducing bias leads to performance loss, users may have varying needs for balancing bias mitigation with overall model capabilities, highlighting the demand for methods that enable controllable bias reduction during inference. Activation steering is a popular approach for inference-time controllability that has shown potential in inducing safer behavior in large language models (LLMs). However, we observe that current steering methods struggle to correct biases, where equiprobable outcomes across demographic groups are required. To address this, we propose Direct Steering Optimization (DSO) which uses reinforcement learning to find linear transformations for steering activations, tailored to mitigate bias while maintaining control over model performance. We demonstrate that DSO achieves state-of-the-art trade-off between fairness and capabilities on both VLMs and LLMs, while offering practitioners inference-time control over the trade-off. Overall, our work highlights the benefit of designing steering strategies that are directly optimized to control model behavior, providing more effective bias intervention than methods that rely on pre-defined heuristics for controllability."}

Our main result is an efficient query algorithm that, from noisy oracle access to $f$, identifies all feature directions whose responses are non-degenerate and reconstructs the function $f$. Crucially, our algorithm works in a significantly more general setting than all related prior results -- we allow for essentially arbitrary superpositions, only requiring that $v_i, v_j$ are not nearly identical for $i \\neq j$, and general response functions $σ_i$. At a high level, our algorithm introduces an approach for searching in Fourier space by iteratively refining the search space to locate the hidden directions $v_i$."}

However, both transfer learning and the exploitation of spatial variability in this field are challenging, as they involve heterogeneous data and complex cross-scale dependencies. Conventional approaches often rely on location-independent parameterizations and independent training, underutilizing transfer learning and spatial heterogeneity in the inputs, and limiting their applicability in regions with substantial variability. We propose FTBSC-KGML (Fine-Tuning-Based Site Calibration-Knowledge-Guided Machine Learning), a pretraining- and fine-tuning-based, spatial-variability-aware, and knowledge-guided machine learning framework that augments KGML-ag with a pretraining-fine-tuning process and site-specific parameters. Using a pretraining-fine-tuning process with remote-sensing GPP, climate, and soil covariates collected across multiple midwestern sites, FTBSC-KGML estimates land emissions while leveraging transfer learning and spatial heterogeneity. A key component is a spatial-heterogeneity-aware transfer-learning scheme, which is a globally pretrained model that is fine-tuned at each state or site to learn place-aware representations, thereby improving local accuracy under limited data without sacrificing interpretability. Empirically, FTBSC-KGML achieves lower validation error and greater consistency in explanatory power than a purely global model, thereby better capturing spatial variability across states.

However, they suffer from diseconomies of scale, and their financial viability remains unconvincing. One step in addressing this shortcoming is to design these reactors with comprehensive economic and physics analyses informing early-stage design iteration. In this work, we present a novel unifying geometric design optimization approach that accounts for techno-economic considerations. We start by generating random samples to train surrogate models, including Gaussian processes (GPs) and multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs). We then deploy these surrogates within a reinforcement learning (RL)-based optimization framework to optimize the levelized cost of electricity (LCOE), all the while imposing constraints on the fuel lifetime, shutdown margin (SDM), peak heat flux, and rod-integrated peaking factor. We study two cases: one in which the axial reflector cost is very high, and one in which it is inexpensive. We found that the operation and maintenance and capital costs are the primary contributors to the overall LCOE particularly the cost of the axial reflectors (for the first case) and the control drum materials. The optimizer cleverly changes the design parameters so as to minimize one of them while still satisfying the constraints, ultimately reducing the LCOE by more than 57% in both instances. A comprehensive integration of fuel and HP performance with multi-objective optimization is currently being pursued to fully understand the interaction between constraints and cost performance."}

While deep learning models have achieved strong predictive performance, they often overlook underlying physical processes, limiting interpretability and generalization. Recent causal learning approaches address these issues by integrating domain knowledge, yet they typically rely on fixed causal graphs that fail to adapt to data. We propose CauStream, a unified framework for causal spatiotemporal streamflow forecasting. CauSTream jointly learns (i) a runoff causal graph among meteorological forcings and (ii) a routing graph capturing dynamic dependencies across stations. We further establish identifiability conditions for these causal structures under a nonparametric setting. We evaluate CauSTream on three major U.S. river basins across three forecasting horizons. The model consistently outperforms prior state-of-the-art methods, with performance gaps widening at longer forecast windows, indicating stronger generalization to unseen conditions. Beyond forecasting, CauSTream also learns causal graphs that capture relationships among hydrological factors and stations. The inferred structures align closely with established domain knowledge, offering interpretable insights into watershed dynamics. CauSTream offers a principled foundation for causal spatiotemporal modeling, with the potential to extend to a wide range of scientific and environmental applications."}

ICL had originally been thought to emerge from the self-attention mechanism in autoregressive transformer architectures. DeepOSets is a non-autoregressive, non-attention based neural architecture that combines set learning via the DeepSets architecture with operator learning via Deep Operator Networks (DeepONets). In a previous study, DeepOSets was shown to display ICL capabilities in supervised learning problems. In this paper, we show that the DeepOSets architecture, with the appropriate modifications, is a multi-operator in-context learner that can recover the solution operator of a new PDE, not seen during training, from example pairs of parameter and solution placed in a user prompt, without any weight updates. Furthermore, we show that DeepOSets is a universal uniform approximator over a class of continuous operators, which we believe is the first result of its kind in the literature of scientific machine learning. This means that a single DeepOSets architecture exists that approximates in-context any continuous operator in the class to any fixed desired degree accuracy, given an appropriate number of examples in the prompt. Experiments with Poisson and reaction-diffusion forward and inverse boundary-value problems demonstrate the ability of the proposed model to use in-context examples to predict accurately the solutions corresponding to parameter queries for PDEs not seen during training."}

At the same time, released data should retain its usefulness for model-training. The standard method for private information obfuscation in images is Gaussian blurring. In this work, we show that practical implementations of Gaussian blurring are reversible enough to break privacy. We then take a closer look at the privacy-utility tradeoffs offered by three other obfuscation algorithms -- pixelization, pixelization and noise addition (DP-Pix), and cropping. Privacy is evaluated by reversal and discrimination attacks, while utility by the quality of the learnt representations when the model is trained on data with obfuscated faces. We show that the most popular industry-standard method, Gaussian blur is the least private of the four -- being susceptible to reversal attacks in its practical low-precision implementations. In contrast, pixelization and pixelization plus noise addition, when used at the right level of granularity, offer both privacy and utility for a number of computer vision tasks. We make our proposed methods together with suggested parameters available in a software package called Privacy Blur."}

Under a linear Gaussian structural equation model (SEM) with equal noise variances, the problem is identifiable and we show that the ensemble precision matrix of the observations exhibits a distinctive structure that facilitates DAG recovery. Exploiting this property, we propose BUILD (Bottom-Up Inference of Linear DAGs), a deterministic stepwise algorithm that identifies leaf nodes and their parents, then prunes the leaves by removing incident edges to proceed to the next step, exactly reconstructing the DAG from the true precision matrix. In practice, precision matrices must be estimated from finite data, and ill-conditioning may lead to error accumulation across BUILD steps. As a mitigation strategy, we periodically re-estimate the precision matrix (with less variables as leaves are pruned), trading off runtime for enhanced robustness. Reproducible results on challenging synthetic benchmarks demonstrate that BUILD compares favorably to state-of-the-art DAG learning algorithms, while offering an explicit handle on complexity."}

While it protects the rights of users requesting unlearning, it also introduces new privacy risks. Prior works have primarily focused on the privacy of data that has been unlearned, while the risks to retained data remain largely unexplored. To address this gap, we focus on the privacy risks of retained data and, for the first time, reveal the vulnerabilities introduced by machine unlearning under the dual-view setting, where an adversary can query both the original and the unlearned models. From an information-theoretic perspective, we introduce the concept of {privacy knowledge gain} and demonstrate that the dual-view setting allows adversaries to obtain more information than querying either model alone, thereby amplifying privacy leakage. To effectively demonstrate this threat, we propose DVIA, a Dual-View Inference Attack, which extracts membership information on retained data using black-box queries to both models. DVIA eliminates the need to train an attack model and employs a lightweight likelihood ratio inference module for efficient inference. Experiments across different datasets and model architectures validate the effectiveness of DVIA and highlight the privacy risks inherent in the dual-view setting."}

Cube drawings are modeled as graphs with node features encoding spatial coordinates, local graphlet-based topology, and angular geometry, which are processed using graph neural networks and fused with age, education, and NPT features in a late-fusion model. Experimental results show that graph-based representations provide a strong unimodal baseline and substantially outperform pixel-based convolutional models, while multimodal integration further improves performance and robustness to class imbalance. SHAP-based interpretability analysis identifies specific graphlet motifs and geometric distortions as key predictors, closely aligning with clinical observations of disorganized cube drawings in AD.

Accurately predicting runout at scale requires models that are both physically realistic and computationally efficient, yet existing approaches face a fundamental speed-realism trade-off. Here we train a machine learning model to predict geohazard runout across representative real world terrains. The model predicts both flow extent and deposit thickness with high accuracy and 100 to 10,000 times faster computation than numerical solvers. It is trained on over 100,000 numerical simulations across over 10,000 real world digital elevation model chips and reproduces key physical behaviours, including avulsion and deposition patterns, while generalizing across different flow types, sizes and landscapes.

This raises a critical question: can OOD detection be extended to OOD classification without true label information? To address this question, we propose a Coarse-to-Fine open-set Classification (CFC) framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) for graph datasets. CFC consists of three key components: a coarse classifier that uses LLM prompts for OOD detection and outlier label generation, a GNN-based fine classifier trained with OOD samples identified by the coarse classifier for enhanced OOD detection and ID classification, and refined OOD classification achieved through LLM prompts and post-processed OOD labels. Unlike methods that rely on synthetic or auxiliary OOD samples, CFC employs semantic OOD instances that are genuinely out-of-distribution based on their inherent meaning, improving interpretability and practical utility.

Federated graph learning (FGL) addresses this by enabling collaborative GNN model training without sharing private data. However, a core challenge in FGL systems is the variation in local training data distributions among clients, known as the data heterogeneity problem. Most existing solutions suffer from two problems: (1) The typical optimizer based on empirical risk minimization tends to cause local models to fall into sharp valleys and weakens their generalization to out-of-distribution graph data. (2) The prevalent dimensional collapse in the learned representations of local graph data has an adverse impact on the classification capacity of the GNN model. To this end, we formulate a novel optimization objective that is aware of the sharpness (i.e., the curvature of the loss surface) of local GNN models. By minimizing the loss function and its sharpness simultaneously, we seek out model parameters in a flat region with uniformly low loss values, thus improving the generalization over heterogeneous data. By introducing a regularizer based on the correlation matrix of local representations, we relax the correlations of representations generated by individual local graph samples, so as to alleviate the dimensional collapse of the learned model.

Our method independently evaluates multiple PTQ algorithms on each layer and employs Linear Centered Kernel Alignment (CKA) as a metric to automatically select the optimal quantization strategy per layer.

Recent studies suggest that machine unlearning can help ensure deployed models comply with evolving legal, safety, and governance requirements. However, current unlearning techniques assume clean separation between forget and retain datasets, which is challenging in operational settings characterized by highly entangled distributions. In such scenarios, perturbation-based methods often degrade general model utility or fail to ensure safety. To address this, we propose Selective Representation Misdirection for Unlearning (SRMU), a novel principled activation-editing framework that enforces feature-aware and directionally controlled perturbations. Unlike indiscriminate model weights perturbations, SRMU employs a structured misdirection vector with an activation importance map. The goal is to allow SRMU selectively suppresses harmful representations while preserving the utility on benign ones. Experiments are conducted on the widely used WMDP benchmark across low- and high-entanglement configurations. Empirical results reveal that SRMU delivers state-of-the-art unlearning performance with minimal utility losses, and remains effective under 20-30\\% overlap where existing baselines collapse. SRMU provides a robust foundation for safety-driven model governance, privacy compliance, and controlled knowledge removal in the emerging LLM-based applications.

To date, quantitative verification has been explored almost exclusively for deep neural networks (DNNs). Representative methods, such as DeepGemini and FairQuant, all build on the core idea of Counterexample-Guided Abstraction Refinement, a generic framework that could be adapted to other model classes. We extended the framework into a model-agnostic form, but discovered two limitations: (i) it can provide only lower bounds, and (ii) its performance scales poorly. Exploiting the discrete structure of tree ensembles, our work proposes an efficient quantification technique that delivers any-time upper and lower bounds.

Kascade computes exact Top-k indices in a small set of anchor layers, then reuses those indices in intermediate reuse layers.

However, existing research faces two limitations: (1) the high complexity of optimizing water-nitrogen combinations during crop growth and poor yield optimization results; and (2) the difficulty in quantifying mild stress signals and the delayed feedback, which results in less precise dynamic regulation of water and nitrogen and lower resource utilization efficiency. To address these issues, we propose a Nested Dual-Agent Reinforcement Learning (NDRL) method. The parent agent in NDRL identifies promising macroscopic irrigation and fertilization actions based on projected cumulative yield benefits, reducing ineffective explorationwhile maintaining alignment between objectives and yield. The child agent's reward function incorporates quantified Water Stress Factor (WSF) and Nitrogen Stress Factor (NSF), and uses a mixed probability distribution to dynamically optimize daily strategies, thereby enhancing both yield and resource efficiency. We used field experiment data from 2023 and 2024 to calibrate and validate the Decision Support System for Agrotechnology Transfer (DSSAT) to simulate real-world conditions and interact with NDRL. Experimental results demonstrate that, compared to the best baseline, the simulated yield increased by 4.7% in both 2023 and 2024, the irrigation water productivity increased by 5.6% and 5.1% respectively, and the nitrogen partial factor productivity increased by 6.3% and 1.0% respectively.

When partial differential equations are involved, full-order models such as those based on the Finite Element Method can make traditional sampling approaches like Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) computationally infeasible. Although data-driven surrogate models may help reduce evaluation costs, their utility is often limited by the expense of generating high-fidelity data. In contrast, low-fidelity data can be produced more efficiently, although relying on them alone may degrade the accuracy of the inverse UQ solution.\n  To address these challenges, we propose a Multi-Fidelity Delayed Acceptance scheme for Bayesian inverse problems. Extending the Multi-Level Delayed Acceptance framework, the method introduces multi-fidelity neural networks that combine the predictions of solvers of varying fidelity, with high fidelity evaluations restricted to an offline training stage. During the online phase, likelihood evaluations are obtained by evaluating the coarse solvers and passing their outputs to the trained neural networks, thereby avoiding additional high-fidelity simulations.\n  This construction allows heterogeneous coarse solvers to be incorporated consistently within the hierarchy, providing greater flexibility than standard Multi-Level Delayed Acceptance. The proposed approach improves the approximation accuracy of the low fidelity solvers, leading to longer sub-chain lengths, better mixing, and accelerated posterior inference. The effectiveness of the strategy is demonstrated on two benchmark inverse problems involving (i) steady isotropic groundwater flow, (ii) an unsteady reaction-diffusion system, for which substantial computational savings are obtained."}

To address this challenge, we need to develop fairness evaluation methodologies for multi-agent predictive systems and measure the fairness characteristics of these systems in the financial tabular domain. Examining fairness metrics using large-scale simulations across diverse multi-agent configurations, with varying communication and collaboration mechanisms, we reveal patterns of emergent bias in financial decision-making that cannot be traced to individual agent components, indicating that multi-agent systems may exhibit genuinely collective behaviors. Our findings highlight that fairness risks in financial multi-agent systems represent a significant component of model risk, with tangible impacts on tasks such as credit scoring and income estimation. We advocate that multi-agent decision systems must be evaluated as holistic entities rather than through reductionist analyses of their constituent components."}

One of the applications of the IoT is in the field of medicine, which is called the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT). Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia (ALL) is a type of cancer categorized as a hematic disease. It usually begins in the bone marrow due to the overproduction of immature White Blood Cells (WBCs or leukocytes). Since it has a high rate of spread to other body organs, it is a fatal disease if not diagnosed and treated early. Therefore, for identifying cancerous (ALL) cells in medical diagnostic laboratories, blood, as well as bone marrow smears, are taken by pathologists. However, manual examinations face limitations due to human error risk and time-consuming procedures. So, to tackle the mentioned issues, methods based on Artificial Intelligence (AI), capable of identifying cancer from non-cancer tissue, seem vital. Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are the most efficient machine learning (ML) methods. These techniques employ multiple layers to extract higher-level features from the raw input. In this paper, a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is applied along with a new type of classifier, Higher Order Singular Value Decomposition (HOSVD), to categorize ALL and normal (healthy) cells from microscopic blood images. We employed the model on IoMT structure to identify leukemia quickly and safely. With the help of this new leukemia classification framework, patients and clinicians can have real-time communication.

In this work, we propose Persistent Leaves Spatial Clustering for Applications with Noise (PLSCAN). This novel density-based clustering algorithm efficiently identifies all minimum cluster sizes for which HDBSCAN* produces stable (leaf) clusters. PLSCAN applies scale-space clustering principles and is equivalent to persistent homology on a novel metric space.

To address this, we investigate the source-data-free cross-receiver RFFI (SCRFFI) problem, where a model pretrained on labeled signals from a source receiver must adapt to unlabeled signals from a target receiver, without access to any source-domain data during adaptation. We first formulate a novel constrained pseudo-labeling-based SCRFFI adaptation framework, and provide a theoretical analysis of its generalization performance. Our analysis highlights a key insight: the target-domain performance is highly sensitive to the quality of the pseudo-labels generated during adaptation. Motivated by this, we propose Momentum Soft pseudo-label Source Hypothesis Transfer (MS-SHOT), a new method for SCRFFI that incorporates momentum-center-guided soft pseudo-labeling and enforces global structural constraints to encourage confident and diverse predictions. Notably, MS-SHOT effectively addresses scenarios involving label shift or unknown, non-uniform class distributions in the target domain -- a significant limitation of prior methods. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that MS-SHOT consistently outperforms existing approaches in both accuracy and robustness, offering a practical and scalable solution for source-data-free cross-receiver adaptation in RFFI."}

These tasks demand different levels of annotation granularity but are frequently constrained by the scarcity of region-level (dense) annotations. We introduce CLARiTy (Class Localizing and Attention Refining Image Transformer), a vision transformer-based model for joint multi-label classification and weakly-supervised localization of thoracic pathologies. CLARiTy employs multiple class-specific tokens to generate discriminative attention maps, and a SegmentCAM module for foreground segmentation and background suppression using explicit anatomical priors. Trained on image-level labels from the NIH ChestX-ray14 dataset, it leverages distillation from a ConvNeXtV2 teacher for efficiency. Evaluated on the official NIH split, the CLARiTy-S-16-512 (a configuration of CLARiTy), achieves competitive classification performance across 14 pathologies, and state-of-the-art weakly-supervised localization performance on 8 pathologies, outperforming prior methods by 50.7%. In particular, pronounced gains occur for small pathologies like nodules and masses. The lower-resolution variant of CLARiTy, CLARiTy-S-16-224, offers high efficiency while decisively surpassing baselines, thereby having the potential for use in low-resource settings. An ablation study confirms contributions of SegmentCAM, DINO pretraining, orthogonal class token loss, and attention pooling. CLARiTy advances beyond CNN-ViT hybrids by harnessing ViT self-attention for global context and class-specific localization, refined through convolutional background suppression for precise, noise-reduced heatmaps."}

This paper presents an AI model for a phishing detection system that uses an ensemble approach to combine character-level Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and LightGBM with engineered features. Our system uses a character-level CNN to extract sequential features after extracting 36 lexical, structural, and domain-based features from the URLs. On a test dataset of 19,873 URLs, the ensemble model achieves an accuracy of 99.819 percent, precision of 100 percent, recall of 99.635 percent, and ROC-AUC of 99.947 percent. Through a FastAPI-based service with an intuitive user interface, the suggested system has been utilised to offer real-time detection. In contrast, the results demonstrate that the suggested solution performs better than individual models; LightGBM contributes 40 percent and character-CNN contributes 60 percent to the final prediction. The suggested method maintains extremely low false positive rates while doing a good job of identifying contemporary phishing techniques.

However, these mechanisms lack theoretical grounding and cannot support context-aware selection from latent state dynamics. To address these limitations, we propose KOSS, a Kalman-optimal Selective State Space model that formulates selection as latent state uncertainty minimization. Derived from estimation theory, KOSS adopts a continuous-time latent update driven by a Kalman gain that dynamically modulates information propagation based on content and context, enabling a closed-loop, context-aware selectivity mechanism. To ensure stable computation and near-linear scalability, KOSS employs global spectral differentiation for frequency-domain derivative estimation, along with a segment-wise scan for hardware-efficient processing. On a selective copying task with distractors, KOSS achieves over 79\\% accuracy while baselines drop below 20\\%, demonstrating robust context-aware selection. Furthermore, across nine long-term forecasting benchmarks, KOSS reduces MSE by 2.92--36.23\\% and consistently outperforms state-of-the-art models in both accuracy and stability. To assess real-world applicability, a case study on secondary surveillance radar (SSR) tracking confirms KOSS's robustness under irregular intervals and noisy conditions and demonstrates its effectiveness in real-world applications. Finally, supplementary experiments verify Kalman gain convergence and the frequency response of spectral differentiation, providing theoretical support for the proposed closed-loop design."}

These systems exhibit high-dimensional, non-linear dynamics, making their modelling, classification, and prediction particularly challenging. Advances in information technology have enabled data-driven approaches to studying such systems. However, the sheer volume and complexity of spatio-temporal data often hinder traditional methods like dimensionality reduction, phase-space reconstruction, and attractor characterisation. This paper introduces a geometric framework for analysing spatio-temporal data from complex systems, grounded in the theory of vector fields over discrete measure spaces. We propose a two-parameter family of metrics suitable for data analysis and machine learning applications. The framework supports time-dependent images, image gradients, and real- or vector-valued functions defined on graphs and simplicial complexes. We validate our approach using data from numerical simulations of biological and physical systems on flat and curved domains. Our results show that the proposed metrics, combined with multidimensional scaling, effectively address key analytical challenges. They enable dimensionality reduction, mode decomposition, phase-space reconstruction, and attractor characterisation. Our findings offer a robust pathway for understanding complex dynamical systems, especially in contexts where traditional modelling is impractical but abundant experimental data are available."}

Prefix caching partially alleviates some of these costs by reusing KV cache for previously processed tokens, but limited by strict prefix matching. Position-independent caching (PIC) enables chunk-level reuse at arbitrary positions, but requires selective recomputation and positional-encoding (PE) adjustments. However, because these operations vary across queries, KV for the same chunk diverges across requests. Moreover, without page alignment, chunk KV layouts diverge in memory, preventing page sharing. These issues result in only modest HBM savings even when many requests reuse the same content.\n  We present MEPIC, a memory-efficient PIC system that enables chunk KV reuse across positions, requests, and batches. MEPIC aligns chunk KV to paged storage, shifts recomputation from token- to block-level so only the first block is request-specific, removes positional encodings via Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) fusion in the attention kernel, and makes remaining blocks fully shareable. These techniques eliminate most duplicate chunk KV in HBM, reducing usage by up to 2x over state-of-the-art PIC at comparable latency and accuracy, and up to 5x for long prompts, without any model changes."}

TRC applies compact networks (approximately 1.5M parameters) repeatedly through a two-level hierarchical latent structure, refining control sequences by simulating trajectories and correcting based on tracking error. Because the same weights process every refinement step, adding iterations increases computation without increasing memory. We evaluate TRC on nonlinear control problems including oscillator stabilization and powered descent with fuel constraints. Across these domains, TRC achieves near-optimal control costs while requiring only millisecond-scale inference on GPU and under 10~MB memory, two orders of magnitude smaller than language model baselines.

In this paper, we present LaMer, a general Meta-RL framework that enables LLM agents to actively explore and learn from the environment feedback at test time. LaMer consists of two key components: (i) a cross-episode training framework to encourage exploration and long-term rewards optimization; and (ii) in-context policy adaptation via reflection, allowing the agent to adapt their policy from task feedback signal without gradient update. Experiments across diverse environments show that LaMer significantly improves performance over RL baselines, with 11%, 14%, and 19% performance gains on Sokoban, MineSweeper and Webshop, respectively. Moreover, LaMer also demonstrates better generalization to more challenging or previously unseen tasks compared to the RL-trained agents. Overall, our results demonstrate that Meta-RL provides a principled approach to induce exploration in language agents, enabling more robust adaptation to novel environments through learned exploration strategies."}

This paper explores a key challenge of Online Edge ML: \"How to determine labels for truly future, unseen data points\". We propose Knowledge Transformation (KT), a hybrid method combining Knowledge Distillation, Active Learning, and causal reasoning. In short, KT acts as the oracle in active learning by transforming knowledge from a teacher model to generate pseudo-labels for training a student model. To verify the validity of the method, we conducted simulation experiments with two setups: (1) using a less stable teacher model and (2) a relatively more stable teacher model. Results indicate that when a stable teacher model is given, the student model can eventually reach its expected maximum performance. KT is potentially beneficial for scenarios that meet the following circumstances: (1) when the teacher's task is generic, which means existing pre-trained models might be adequate for its task, so there will be no need to train the teacher model from scratch; and/or (2) when the label for the student's task is difficult or expensive to acquire."}

This ability, known as Continual learning, provides a foundation for AI systems to develop themselves adaptively. Catastrophic forgetting is a major challenge to the progress of Continual Learning approaches, where learning a new task usually results in a dramatic performance drop on previously learned ones. Many approaches have emerged to counteract the impact of CF. Most of the proposed approaches can be categorized into five classes: replay-based, regularization-based, optimization-based, representation-based, and architecture-based. In this work, we approach the problem from a different angle, specifically by considering the optimal sequencing of tasks as they are presented to the model. We investigate the role of task sequencing in mitigating CF and propose a method for determining the optimal task order. The proposed method leverages zero-shot scoring algorithms inspired by neural architecture search (NAS). Results demonstrate that intelligent task sequencing can substantially reduce CF. Moreover, when combined with traditional continual learning strategies, sequencing offers enhanced performance and robustness against forgetting. Additionally, the presented approaches can find applications in other fields, such as curriculum learning."}

Attempts to expand sampling across hospitals, institutions, or countries with differing regulations face severe privacy, regulatory, and logistical obstacles that are often difficult to overcome. The Federated Learning (FL) provides a promising solution by enabling collaborative model training across decentralized datasets while keeping patient data local and private. Here, we report a novel global FL initiative using the Sherpa.ai FL platform, which leverages FL across distributed datasets in two international organizations for the diagnosis of COL6-RD, using collagen VI immunofluorescence microscopy images from patient-derived fibroblast cultures. Our solution resulted in an ML model capable of classifying collagen VI patient images into the three primary pathogenic mechanism groups associated with COL6-RD: exon skipping, glycine substitution, and pseudoexon insertion. This new approach achieved an F1-score of 0.82, outperforming single-organization models (0.57-0.75). These results demonstrate that FL substantially improves diagnostic utility and generalizability compared to isolated institutional models.

Our use in research settings surfaced the concerning \"blacks\" thematic topic label. Through quantitative and qualitative means we investigate this label's use in the training corpus, what concepts it might be encoding in the trained classifier, and how those concepts impact our model use.

This finetuning step has proved critical in achieving human or super-human performance, yet while much attention has been given to developing more effective finetuning algorithms, little attention has been given to ensuring the pretrained policy is an effective initialization for RL finetuning. In this work we seek to understand how the pretrained policy affects finetuning performance, and how to pretrain policies in order to ensure they are effective initializations for finetuning. We first show theoretically that standard behavioral cloning (BC) -- which trains a policy to directly match the actions played by the demonstrator -- can fail to ensure coverage over the demonstrator's actions, a minimal condition necessary for effective RL finetuning. We then show that if, instead of exactly fitting the observed demonstrations, we train a policy to model the posterior distribution of the demonstrator's behavior given the demonstration dataset, we do obtain a policy that ensures coverage over the demonstrator's actions, enabling more effective finetuning. Furthermore, this policy -- which we refer to as the posterior behavioral cloning (PostBC) policy -- achieves this while ensuring pretrained performance is no worse than that of the BC policy. We then show that PostBC is practically implementable with modern generative models in robotic control domains -- relying only on standard supervised learning -- and leads to significantly improved RL finetuning performance on both realistic robotic control benchmarks and real-world robotic manipulation tasks, as compared to standard behavioral cloning."}

Recent studies suggest that RLVR can elicit strong mathematical reasoning in LLMs through two seemingly paradoxical mechanisms: spurious rewards, which suppress exploitation by rewarding outcomes unrelated to the ground truth, and entropy minimization, which suppresses exploration by pushing the model toward more confident and deterministic outputs, highlighting a puzzling dynamic: both discouraging exploitation and discouraging exploration improve reasoning performance, yet the underlying principles that reconcile these effects remain poorly understood. We focus on two fundamental questions: (i) how policy entropy relates to performance, and (ii) whether spurious rewards yield gains, potentially through the interplay of clipping bias and model contamination. Our results show that clipping bias under spurious rewards reduces policy entropy, leading to more confident and deterministic outputs, while entropy minimization alone is insufficient for improvement. We further propose a reward-misalignment model explaining why spurious rewards can enhance performance beyond contaminated settings. Our findings clarify the mechanisms behind spurious-reward benefits and provide principles for more effective RLVR training."}

Unlike traditional deployments where schedulers can treat instances as black boxes, DP+EP architectures exhibit high internal synchronization costs. We identify that immediate request dispatching in such systems leads to severe in-engine queuing and parallelization bubbles, degrading Time-to-First-Token (TTFT). To address this, we propose Staggered Batch Scheduling (SBS), a mechanism that deliberately buffers requests to form optimal execution batches. This temporal decoupling eliminates internal queuing bubbles without compromising throughput. Furthermore, leveraging the scheduling window created by buffering, we introduce a Load-Aware Global Allocation strategy that balances computational load across DP units for both Prefill and Decode phases. Deployed on a production H800 cluster serving Deepseek-V3, our system reduces TTFT by 30%-40% and improves throughput by 15%-20% compared to state-of-the-art immediate scheduling baselines."}
