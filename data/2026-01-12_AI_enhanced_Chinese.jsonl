RRAM based in memory computing suffers from scalability limitations due to device non idealities and fixed array sizes. Decentralized AI frameworks struggle with memory efficiency across NAT constrained networks due to static routing that ignores computational load. Multi agent deployment systems tightly couple application logic with execution environments, preventing adaptive memory optimization. These challenges stem from a fundamental lack of coordinated memory management across architectural layers. We introduce Self Evolving Distributed Memory Architecture for Scalable AI Systems, a three layer framework that unifies memory management across computation, communication, and deployment. Our approach features (1) memory guided matrix processing with dynamic partitioning based on device characteristics, (2) memory aware peer selection considering network topology and computational capacity, and (3) runtime adaptive deployment optimization through continuous reconfiguration. The framework maintains dual memory systems tracking both long term performance patterns and short term workload statistics. Experiments on COCO 2017, ImageNet, and SQuAD show that our method achieves 87.3 percent memory utilization efficiency and 142.5 operations per second compared to Ray Distributed at 72.1 percent and 98.7 operations per second, while reducing communication latency by 30.2 percent to 171.2 milliseconds and improving resource utilization to 82.7 percent.

This memory pressure limits the maximum batch size and sequence length that can fit on GPUs, and also results in excessive data movements that hinders performance and efficient model scaling. We present MoEBlaze, a memory-efficient MoE training framework that addresses these issues through a co-designed system approach: (i) an end-to-end token dispatch and MoE training method with optimized data structures to eliminate intermediate buffers and activation materializing, and (ii) co-designed kernels with smart activation checkpoint to mitigate memory footprint while simultaneously achieving better performance.

Moreover, scientific applications often face memory bandwidth constraints, making it critical to optimize data locality and enhance the efficiency of data transport. We extend the lattice QCD solver DD-$\u03b1$AMG to incorporate multiple right-hand sides (rhs) for both the Wilson-Dirac operator evaluation and the GMRES solver, with and without odd-even preconditioning. To optimize auto-vectorization, we introduce a flexible interface that supports various data layouts and implement a new data layout for better SIMD utilization. We evaluate our optimizations on both x86 and Arm clusters, demonstrating performance portability with similar speedups.

While useful for arithmetic, programming, and problem solving, this design is costly, blurs claim level auditability, and cannot re-trigger explicit reasoning once the model begins presenting. Dialogue models are also largely blind to temporal structure, treating replies after seconds and replies after weeks as equivalent unless time is stated in text. We introduce TIME, the Temporally Intelligent Meta-reasoning Engine, a behavioral alignment framework that treats explicit reasoning as a context sensitive resource driven by discourse and temporal cues. TIME augments dialogue with optional ISO 8601 <time> tags, tick turns that represent silent gaps, and short <think> blocks that can appear anywhere in a reply. A four-phase curriculum including a small, maximally diverse full-batch alignment step trains Qwen3 dense models to invoke brief, in-place reasoning bursts and keep user facing text compact. We evaluate with TIMEBench, a temporally grounded dialogue benchmark probing chronology, commonsense under gaps and offsets, anomaly detection, and continuity. Across 4B to 32B scales, TIME improves TIMEBench scores over base Qwen3 in both thinking and no-thinking modes while reducing reasoning tokens by about an order of magnitude.

However, existing FDG methods typically struggle with cross-client data heterogeneity and incur significant communication and computation overhead. To address these challenges, this paper presents a new FDG framework, dubbed FaST-PT, which facilitates local feature augmentation and efficient unseen domain adaptation in a distributed manner. First, we propose a lightweight Multi-Modal Style Transfer (MST) method to transform image embedding under text supervision, which could expand the training data distribution and mitigate domain shift. We then design a dual-prompt module that decomposes the prompt into global and domain prompts. Specifically, global prompts capture general knowledge from augmented embedding across clients, while domain prompts capture domain-specific knowledge from local data. Besides, Domain-aware Prompt Generation (DPG) is introduced to adaptively generate suitable prompts for each sample, which facilitates unseen domain adaptation through knowledge fusion. Extensive experiments on four cross-domain benchmark datasets, e.g., PACS and DomainNet, demonstrate the superior performance of FaST-PT over SOTA FDG methods such as FedDG-GA and DiPrompt. Ablation studies further validate the effectiveness and efficiency of FaST-PT.", "AI": {"tldr": "FaST-PT\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u8054\u90a6\u9886\u57df\u6cdb\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u98ce\u683c\u8f6c\u79fb\u8fdb\u884c\u672c\u5730\u7279\u5f81\u589e\u5f3a\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u53cc\u63d0\u793a\u6a21\u5757\uff08\u5168\u5c40\u548c\u9886\u57df\u63d0\u793a\uff09\u548c\u9886\u57df\u611f\u77e5\u63d0\u793a\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u5728\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u672a\u89c1\u9886\u57df\u9002\u5e94\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u8054\u90a6\u9886\u57df\u6cdb\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u9762\u4e34\u8de8\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u6570\u636e\u5f02\u6784\u6027\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u4e14\u901a\u4fe1\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u5927\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u65e2\u80fd\u5904\u7406\u6570\u636e\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u53c8\u80fd\u964d\u4f4e\u5f00\u9500\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "1. \u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u98ce\u683c\u8f6c\u79fb\uff1a\u5728\u6587\u672c\u76d1\u7763\u4e0b\u8f6c\u6362\u56fe\u50cf\u5d4c\u5165\uff0c\u6269\u5c55\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u5206\u5e03\uff1b2. \u53cc\u63d0\u793a\u6a21\u5757\uff1a\u5c06\u63d0\u793a\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u5168\u5c40\u63d0\u793a\uff08\u4ece\u8de8\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u589e\u5f3a\u5d4c\u5165\u4e2d\u6355\u83b7\u901a\u7528\u77e5\u8bc6\uff09\u548c\u9886\u57df\u63d0\u793a\uff08\u4ece\u672c\u5730\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u6355\u83b7\u9886\u57df\u7279\u5b9a\u77e5\u8bc6\uff09\uff1b3. \u9886\u57df\u611f\u77e5\u63d0\u793a\u751f\u6210\uff1a\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u4e3a\u6bcf\u4e2a\u6837\u672c\u751f\u6210\u5408\u9002\u63d0\u793a\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u77e5\u8bc6\u878d\u5408\u4fc3\u8fdb\u672a\u89c1\u9886\u57df\u9002\u5e94\u3002", "result": "\u5728PACS\u548cDomainNet\u7b49\u56db\u4e2a\u8de8\u9886\u57df\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cFaST-PT\u4f18\u4e8eFedDG-GA\u548cDiPrompt\u7b49\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u8054\u90a6\u9886\u57df\u6cdb\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u6d88\u878d\u7814\u7a76\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u548c\u6548\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "FaST-PT\u901a\u8fc7\u672c\u5730\u7279\u5f81\u589e\u5f3a\u548c\u9ad8\u6548\u672a\u89c1\u9886\u57df\u9002\u5e94\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u8054\u90a6\u9886\u57df\u6cdb\u5316\u4e2d\u7684\u6570\u636e\u5f02\u6784\u6027\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

While FL offers notable advantages, it faces critical challenges in ensuring fairness across diverse demographic groups. To address these fairness concerns, various fairness-aware debiasing methods have been proposed. However, many of these approaches either require modifications to clients' training protocols or lack flexibility in their aggregation strategies. In this work, we address these limitations by introducing EquFL, a novel server-side debiasing method designed to mitigate bias in FL systems. EquFL operates by allowing the server to generate a single calibrated update after receiving model updates from the clients. This calibrated update is then integrated with the aggregated client updates to produce an adjusted global model that reduces bias. Theoretically, we establish that EquFL converges to the optimal global model achieved by FedAvg and effectively reduces fairness loss over training rounds.

However, current forecasting models treat blood glucose readings captured using CGMs as a numerical sequence, either ignoring context or relying on additional sensors/modalities that are difficult to collect and deploy at scale. Recently, LLMs have shown promise for time-series forecasting tasks, yet their role as agentic context extractors in diabetes care remains largely unexplored. To address these limitations, we propose GlyRAG, a context-aware, retrieval-augmented forecasting framework that derives semantic understanding of blood glucose dynamics directly from CGM traces without requiring additional sensor modalities. GlyRAG employs an LLM as a contextualization agent to generate clinical summaries. These summaries are embedded by a language model and fused with patch-based glucose representations in a multimodal transformer architecture with a cross translation loss aligining textual and physiological embeddings. A retrieval module then identifies similar historical episodes in the learned embedding space and uses cross-attention to integrate these case-based analogues prior to making a forecasting inference. Extensive evaluations on two T1D cohorts show that GlyRAG consistently outperforms state-of-the art methods, achieving up to 39% lower RMSE and a further 1.7% reduction in RMSE over the baseline. Clinical evaluation shows that GlyRAG places 85% predictions in safe zones and achieves 51% improvement in predicting dysglycemic events across both cohorts. These results indicate that LLM-based contextualization and retrieval over CGM traces can enhance the accuracy and clinical reliability of long-horizon glucose forecasting without the need for extra sensors, thus supporting future agentic decision-support tools for diabetes management.", "AI": {"tldr": "GlyRAG\uff1a\u57fa\u4e8eLLM\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u63d0\u53d6\u548c\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u7684CGM\u8840\u7cd6\u9884\u6d4b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u989d\u5916\u4f20\u611f\u5668\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u957f\u671f\u8840\u7cd6\u9884\u6d4b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u4e34\u5e8a\u53ef\u9760\u6027", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u8840\u7cd6\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u5c06CGM\u6570\u636e\u89c6\u4e3a\u6570\u503c\u5e8f\u5217\uff0c\u8981\u4e48\u5ffd\u7565\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u8981\u4e48\u4f9d\u8d56\u96be\u4ee5\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6536\u96c6\u7684\u989d\u5916\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u3002LLM\u5728\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u9884\u6d4b\u4e2d\u5c55\u73b0\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u5728\u7cd6\u5c3f\u75c5\u62a4\u7406\u4e2d\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u63d0\u53d6\u5668\u7684\u89d2\u8272\u5c1a\u672a\u5145\u5206\u63a2\u7d22\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faGlyRAG\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1) \u4f7f\u7528LLM\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u63d0\u53d6\u4ee3\u7406\uff0c\u4eceCGM\u8f68\u8ff9\u751f\u6210\u4e34\u5e8a\u6458\u8981\uff1b2) \u901a\u8fc7\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5d4c\u5165\u6458\u8981\uff0c\u5e76\u4e0e\u57fa\u4e8epatch\u7684\u8840\u7cd6\u8868\u793a\u5728\u591a\u6a21\u6001Transformer\u4e2d\u878d\u5408\uff1b3) \u91c7\u7528\u4ea4\u53c9\u7ffb\u8bd1\u635f\u5931\u5bf9\u9f50\u6587\u672c\u548c\u751f\u7406\u5d4c\u5165\uff1b4) \u68c0\u7d22\u6a21\u5757\u5728\u5d4c\u5165\u7a7a\u95f4\u8bc6\u522b\u76f8\u4f3c\u5386\u53f2\u4e8b\u4ef6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4ea4\u53c9\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6574\u5408\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6848\u4f8b\u7c7b\u6bd4\u540e\u8fdb\u884c\u9884\u6d4b\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e24\u4e2aT1D\u961f\u5217\u4e0a\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u663e\u793a\uff1a1) \u76f8\u6bd4SOTA\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0cRMSE\u964d\u4f4e\u9ad8\u8fbe39%\uff1b2) \u5728\u57fa\u7ebf\u57fa\u7840\u4e0a\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u964d\u4f4e1.7% RMSE\uff1b3) 85%\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u4f4d\u4e8e\u5b89\u5168\u533a\u57df\uff1b4) \u9884\u6d4b\u8840\u7cd6\u5f02\u5e38\u4e8b\u4ef6\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u534751%\u3002", "conclusion": "LLM\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u63d0\u53d6\u548cCGM\u8f68\u8ff9\u68c0\u7d22\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u4e0d\u4f9d\u8d56\u989d\u5916\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u957f\u671f\u8840\u7cd6\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u4e34\u5e8a\u53ef\u9760\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u7cd6\u5c3f\u75c5\u7ba1\u7406\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u51b3\u7b56\u652f\u6301\u5de5\u5177\u5960\u5b9a\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

Selecting an appropriate kernel is therefore central to model quality, yet remains one of the most challenging and computationally expensive steps in probabilistic modeling. We present a Bayesian optimization framework built on kernel-of-kernels geometry, using expected divergence-based distances between GP priors to explore kernel space efficiently. A multidimensional scaling (MDS) embedding of this distance matrix maps a discrete kernel library into a continuous Euclidean manifold, enabling smooth BO. In this formulation, the input space comprises kernel compositions, the objective is the log marginal likelihood, and featurization is given by the MDS coordinates. When the divergence yields a valid metric, the embedding preserves geometry and produces a stable BO landscape. We demonstrate the approach on synthetic benchmarks, real-world time-series datasets, and an additive manufacturing case study predicting melt-pool geometry, achieving superior predictive accuracy and uncertainty calibration relative to baselines including Large Language Model (LLM)-guided search.

Twin neural network regression is naturally capable of incorporating these properties to invert non-injective functions. Twin neural network regression is trained to predict adjustments to well known input variables $\\mathbf{x}^{\\text{anchor}}$ to obtain an estimate for an unknown $\\mathbf{x}^{\\text{new}}$ under a change of the target variable from $\\mathbf{y}^{\\text{anchor}}$ to $\\mathbf{y}^{\\text{new}}$.

A central but underexplored aspect of IL in this context is the role of the \\emph{expert} that generates training demonstrations. Existing studies employ a wide range of expert constructions, yet lack a unifying framework to characterise their modelling assumptions, computational properties, and impact on learning performance.\n  This paper introduces a systematic taxonomy of experts for IL in combinatorial optimisation under uncertainty. Experts are classified along three dimensions: (i) their treatment of uncertainty, including myopic, deterministic, full-information, two-stage stochastic, and multi-stage stochastic formulations; (ii) their level of optimality, distinguishing task-optimal and approximate experts; and (iii) their interaction mode with the learner, ranging from one-shot supervision to iterative, interactive schemes. Building on this taxonomy, we propose a generalised Dataset Aggregation (DAgger) algorithm that supports multiple expert queries, expert aggregation, and flexible interaction strategies.\n  The proposed framework is evaluated on a dynamic physician-to-patient assignment problem with stochastic arrivals and capacity constraints. Computational experiments compare learning outcomes across expert types and interaction regimes. The results show that policies learned from stochastic experts consistently outperform those learned from deterministic or full-information experts, while interactive learning improves solution quality using fewer expert demonstrations. Aggregated deterministic experts provide an effective alternative when stochastic optimisation becomes computationally challenging.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u6a21\u4eff\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u4e13\u5bb6\u5206\u7c7b\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u5904\u7406\u3001\u6700\u4f18\u6027\u6c34\u5e73\u548c\u4ea4\u4e92\u6a21\u5f0f\u4e09\u4e2a\u7ef4\u5ea6\uff0c\u5e76\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u652f\u6301\u591a\u4e13\u5bb6\u67e5\u8be2\u7684\u901a\u7528DAgger\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u533b\u7597\u5206\u914d\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u968f\u673a\u4e13\u5bb6\u548c\u4ea4\u4e92\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "motivation": "\u6a21\u4eff\u5b66\u4e60\u4e3a\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u7ec4\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u4e13\u5bb6\u6784\u9020\u65b9\u6cd5\u591a\u6837\u4e14\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u7cfb\u7edf\u5206\u6790\u4e0d\u540c\u4e13\u5bb6\u7c7b\u578b\u5bf9\u5b66\u4e60\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e13\u5bb6\u5206\u7c7b\u7684\u4e09\u7ef4\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1)\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u5904\u7406\uff08\u8fd1\u89c6\u3001\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u3001\u5168\u4fe1\u606f\u3001\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u968f\u673a\u3001\u591a\u9636\u6bb5\u968f\u673a\uff09\uff1b2)\u6700\u4f18\u6027\u6c34\u5e73\uff08\u4efb\u52a1\u6700\u4f18vs\u8fd1\u4f3c\uff09\uff1b3)\u4ea4\u4e92\u6a21\u5f0f\uff08\u4e00\u6b21\u6027\u76d1\u7763\u5230\u8fed\u4ee3\u4ea4\u4e92\uff09\u3002\u57fa\u4e8e\u6b64\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u652f\u6301\u591a\u4e13\u5bb6\u67e5\u8be2\u3001\u4e13\u5bb6\u805a\u5408\u548c\u7075\u6d3b\u4ea4\u4e92\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u901a\u7528DAgger\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u533b\u5e08-\u60a3\u8005\u5206\u914d\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff1a1)\u4ece\u968f\u673a\u4e13\u5bb6\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u59cb\u7ec8\u4f18\u4e8e\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u6216\u5168\u4fe1\u606f\u4e13\u5bb6\uff1b2)\u4ea4\u4e92\u5b66\u4e60\u80fd\u7528\u66f4\u5c11\u4e13\u5bb6\u6f14\u793a\u83b7\u5f97\u66f4\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u89e3\uff1b3)\u5f53\u968f\u673a\u4f18\u5316\u8ba1\u7b97\u56f0\u96be\u65f6\uff0c\u805a\u5408\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4e13\u5bb6\u662f\u6709\u6548\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e13\u5bb6\u5206\u7c7b\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u6a21\u4eff\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u7ec4\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u968f\u673a\u4e13\u5bb6\u548c\u4ea4\u4e92\u5b66\u4e60\u7b56\u7565\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u5b66\u4e60\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u805a\u5408\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4e13\u5bb6\u5728\u8ba1\u7b97\u53d7\u9650\u65f6\u662f\u5b9e\u7528\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Existing spatiotemporal graph neural networks typically assume a static adjacency matrix. In this work, we propose an end-to-end dynamic edge-biased spatiotemporal model that ingests a multi-dimensional timeseries of node attributes and a timeseries of adjacency matrices, to predict multiple future steps of node attributes. At each time step, our transformer-based model injects the given adjacency as an adaptable attention bias, allowing the model to focus on relevant neighbors as the graph evolves. We further deploy a masked node-time pretraining objective that primes the encoder to reconstruct missing features, and train with scheduled sampling and a horizon-weighted loss to mitigate compounding error over long horizons. Unlike prior work, our model accommodates dynamic graphs that vary across input samples, enabling forecasting in multi-system settings such as brain networks across different subjects, financial systems in different contexts, or evolving social systems. Empirical results demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms strong baselines on Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE).", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u52a8\u6001\u56fe\u4e0a\u7684\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u591a\u6b65\u8282\u70b9\u5c5e\u6027\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53ef\u9002\u5e94\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u504f\u7f6e\u5904\u7406\u52a8\u6001\u90bb\u63a5\u77e9\u9635\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u9886\u57df\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65f6\u7a7a\u56fe\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u901a\u5e38\u5047\u8bbe\u9759\u6001\u90bb\u63a5\u77e9\u9635\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u5904\u7406\u52a8\u6001\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u56fe\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u800c\u52a8\u6001\u56fe\u8282\u70b9\u5c5e\u6027\u9884\u6d4b\u5728\u91d1\u878d\u3001\u751f\u7269\u3001\u793e\u4ea4\u7f51\u7edc\u7b49\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8eTransformer\u7684\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u52a8\u6001\u8fb9\u504f\u7f6e\u65f6\u7a7a\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5c06\u52a8\u6001\u90bb\u63a5\u77e9\u9635\u4f5c\u4e3a\u53ef\u9002\u5e94\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u504f\u7f6e\u6ce8\u5165\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u63a9\u7801\u8282\u70b9-\u65f6\u95f4\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u76ee\u6807\u3001\u8ba1\u5212\u91c7\u6837\u548c\u6c34\u5e73\u52a0\u6743\u635f\u5931\u6765\u7f13\u89e3\u957f\u671f\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u8bef\u5dee\u7d2f\u79ef\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5747\u65b9\u6839\u8bef\u5dee(RMSE)\u548c\u5e73\u5747\u7edd\u5bf9\u8bef\u5dee(MAE)\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u6301\u7eed\u4f18\u4e8e\u5f3a\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5904\u7406\u8de8\u6837\u672c\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u56fe\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bbe\u7f6e\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u8fb9\u504f\u7f6e\u65f6\u7a7a\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u5904\u7406\u52a8\u6001\u56fe\u7ed3\u6784\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u5e94\u7528\u9886\u57df\u7684\u8282\u70b9\u5c5e\u6027\u591a\u6b65\u9884\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u4e3a\u52a8\u6001\u56fe\u9884\u6d4b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

Specifically, there are (1) challenges in synthesizing high-performing teaching policies in complex domains, (2) difficulties when teachers must reason in out-of-distribution (OOD) states, and (3) mismatches between the decentralized students' and the centralized teacher's observation spaces. To address these limitations, we propose HINT (Hierarchical INteractive Teacher-based transfer), a novel KD framework for MARL in a centralized training, decentralized execution setup. By leveraging hierarchical RL, HINT provides a scalable, high-performing teacher. Our key innovation, pseudo off-policy RL, enables the teacher policy to be updated using both teacher and student experience, thereby improving OOD adaptation. HINT also applies performance-based filtering to retain only outcome-relevant guidance, reducing observation mismatches.

Two main approaches have recently been proposed to address this issue: (i) direct measurementerror correction based on misclassification models such as Rogan-Gladen-style estimators, and (ii) surrogate-outcome approaches such as prediction-powered inference (PPI), which correct bias by calibrating prediction residuals on a small set of gold-standard human labels. In this paper, we systematically study the performance of these two approaches for estimating mean parameters (e.g., average benchmark scores or pairwise win rates). Leveraging tools from semiparametric efficiency theory, we unify the two classes of estimators by deriving explicit forms of efficient influence function (EIF)-based efficient estimators and characterize conditions under which PPI-style estimators attain strictly smaller asymptotic variance than measurement-error corrections.

Durlofsky"], "title": "Prediction of Fault Slip Tendency in CO${_2}$ Storage using Data-space Inversion", "comment": null, "summary": "Accurately assessing the potential for fault slip is essential in many subsurface operations. Conventional model-based history matching methods, which entail the generation of posterior geomodels calibrated to observed data, can be challenging to apply in coupled flow-geomechanics problems with faults. In this work, we implement a variational autoencoder (VAE)-based data-space inversion (DSI) framework to predict pressure, stress and strain fields, and fault slip tendency, in CO${_2}$ storage projects. The main computations required by the DSI workflow entail the simulation of O(1000) prior geomodels. The posterior distributions for quantities of interest are then inferred directly from prior simulation results and observed data, without the need to generate posterior geomodels. The model used here involves a synthetic 3D system with two faults. Realizations of heterogeneous permeability and porosity fields are generated using geostatistical software, and uncertain geomechanical and fault parameters are sampled for each realization from prior distributions. Coupled flow-geomechanics simulations for these geomodels are conducted using GEOS. A VAE with stacked convolutional long short-term memory layers is trained, using the prior simulation results, to represent pressure, strain, effective normal stress and shear stress fields in terms of latent variables.

Manual data creation is expensive, and existing synthetic methods trade off reliability and scalability.

We introduce RingSQL, a hybrid data generation framework that combines schema-independent query templates with LLM-based paraphrasing of natural language questions. This approach preserves SQL correctness across diverse schemas while providing broad linguistic variety. In our experiments, we find that models trained using data produced by RingSQL achieve an average gain in accuracy of +2.3% across six text-to-SQL benchmarks when compared to models trained on other synthetic data.

However, when applied to high-dimensional data or data with latent confounders, these methods, often based on off-the-shelf continuous optimization algorithms, struggle with the vast search space, the complexity of the objective function, and the nontrivial nature of graph-theoretical constraints. As a result, there has been a surge of interest in leveraging super-structures to guide the optimization process. Nonetheless, learning an appropriate super-structure at the right level of granularity, and doing so efficiently across various settings, presents significant challenges.\n  In this paper, we propose ALVGL, a novel and general enhancement to the differentiable causal discovery pipeline. ALVGL employs a sparse and low-rank decomposition to learn the precision matrix of the data. We design an ADMM procedure to optimize this decomposition, identifying components in the precision matrix that are most relevant to the underlying causal structure. These components are then combined to construct a super-structure that is provably a superset of the true causal graph. This super-structure is used to initialize a standard differentiable causal discovery method with a more focused search space, thereby improving both optimization efficiency and accuracy.\n  We demonstrate the versatility of ALVGL by instantiating it across a range of structural causal models, including both Gaussian and non-Gaussian settings, with and without unmeasured confounders.

In this work, we explore inference-time search algorithms that guide the LLM to discover better solutions through iterative refinement based on execution feedback. Our approach, called MaxCode unifies existing search methods under a max-reward reinforcement learning framework, making the observation and action-value functions modular for modification. To enhance the observation space, we integrate a natural language critique model that converts raw execution feedback into diagnostic insights about errors and performance bottlenecks, and the best-discounted reward seen so far. Together, these provide richer input to the code proposal function. To improve exploration during search, we train a generative reward-to-go model using action values from rollouts to rerank potential solutions.

To address these challenges, we propose \\textbf{Hi-ZFO} (\\textbf{Hi}erarchical \\textbf{Z}eroth- and \\textbf{F}irst-\\textbf{O}rder optimization), a hybrid framework designed to synergize the precision of FO gradients with the exploratory capability of ZO estimation. Hi-ZFO adaptively partitions the model through layer-wise importance profiling, applying precise FO updates to critical layers while leveraging ZO optimization for less sensitive ones. Notably, ZO in Hi-ZFO is not merely a memory-saving surrogate; it is intentionally introduced as a source of \"beneficial stochasticity\" to help the model escape the local minima where pure FO optimization tends to stagnate.

However, they often over-search -- unnecessarily invoking search tool even when it does not improve response quality, which leads to computational inefficiency and hallucinations by incorporating irrelevant context. In this work, we conduct a systematic evaluation of over-searching across multiple dimensions, including query types, model categories, retrieval conditions, and multi-turn conversations. Our finding shows: (i) search generally improves answer accuracy on answerable queries but harms abstention on unanswerable ones; (ii) over-searching is more pronounced in complex reasoning models and deep research systems, is exacerbated by noisy retrieval, and compounds across turns in multi-turn conversations; and (iii) the composition of retrieved evidence is crucial, as the presence of negative evidence improves abstention. To quantify over-searching, we introduce Tokens Per Correctness (TPC), an evaluation metric that captures the performance-cost trade-off for search-augmented LLMs. Lastly, we investigate mitigation approaches at both the query and retrieval levels and release the OverSearchQA to foster continued research into efficient search-augmented LLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u641c\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u578b\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u8fc7\u5ea6\u641c\u7d22\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u91cf\u5316\u6307\u6807TPC\uff0c\u5e76\u53d1\u5e03\u4e86\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4fc3\u8fdb\u7814\u7a76", "motivation": "\u641c\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u578b\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u77e5\u8bc6\u5bc6\u96c6\u578b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u4f46\u5b58\u5728\u8fc7\u5ea6\u641c\u7d22\u95ee\u9898\u2014\u2014\u4e0d\u5fc5\u8981\u5730\u8c03\u7528\u641c\u7d22\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u4e0b\u548c\u5e7b\u89c9\u95ee\u9898", "method": "\u4ece\u591a\u4e2a\u7ef4\u5ea6\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u8fc7\u5ea6\u641c\u7d22\uff1a\u67e5\u8be2\u7c7b\u578b\u3001\u6a21\u578b\u7c7b\u522b\u3001\u68c0\u7d22\u6761\u4ef6\u3001\u591a\u8f6e\u5bf9\u8bdd\uff1b\u5f15\u5165Tokens Per Correctness (TPC)\u91cf\u5316\u6307\u6807\uff1b\u7814\u7a76\u67e5\u8be2\u548c\u68c0\u7d22\u5c42\u9762\u7684\u7f13\u89e3\u65b9\u6cd5", "result": "\u641c\u7d22\u901a\u5e38\u63d0\u9ad8\u53ef\u56de\u7b54\u67e5\u8be2\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u635f\u5bb3\u4e0d\u53ef\u56de\u7b54\u67e5\u8be2\u7684\u5f03\u6743\u80fd\u529b\uff1b\u8fc7\u5ea6\u641c\u7d22\u5728\u590d\u6742\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u6df1\u5ea6\u7814\u7a76\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u66f4\u660e\u663e\uff0c\u53d7\u566a\u58f0\u68c0\u7d22\u52a0\u5267\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u8f6e\u5bf9\u8bdd\u4e2d\u7d2f\u79ef\uff1b\u8d1f\u9762\u8bc1\u636e\u7684\u5b58\u5728\u6539\u5584\u5f03\u6743\u80fd\u529b", "conclusion": "\u8fc7\u5ea6\u641c\u7d22\u662f\u641c\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u578bLLMs\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5e73\u8861\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u6210\u672c\uff1b\u63d0\u51fa\u7684TPC\u6307\u6807\u548cOverSearchQA\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5c06\u4fc3\u8fdb\u9ad8\u6548\u641c\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u578bLLMs\u7684\u7814\u7a76"}}

These intrinsic data properties, combined with fragmented governance and incompatible reporting standards, have long hindered the creation of an integrated, cross-city accident prevention framework. To address this gap, we propose the Mamba Local-ttention Spatial-Temporal Network MLA-STNet, a unified system that formulates accident risk prediction as a multi-task learning problem across multiple cities. MLA-STNet integrates two complementary modules: (i)the Spatio-Temporal Geographical Mamba-Attention (STG-MA), which suppresses unstable spatio-temporal fluctuations and strengthens long-range temporal dependencies; and (ii) the Spatio-Temporal Semantic Mamba-Attention (STS-MA), which mitigates cross-city heterogeneity through a shared-parameter design that jointly trains all cities while preserving individual semantic representation spaces. We validate the proposed framework through 75 experiments under two forecasting scenarios, full-day and high-frequency accident periods, using real-world datasets from New York City and Chicago. Compared with the state-of-the-art baselines, MLA-STNet achieves up to 6% lower RMSE, 8% higher Recall, and 5% higher MAP, while maintaining less than 1% performance variation under 50% input noise. These results demonstrate that MLA-STNet effectively unifies heterogeneous urban datasets within a scalable, robust, and interpretable Cross-City Accident Prevention System, paving the way for coordinated and data-driven urban safety management.", "AI": {"tldr": "MLA-STNet\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u8de8\u57ce\u5e02\u4e8b\u6545\u9884\u9632\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u5b66\u4e60\u6574\u5408\u591a\u4e2a\u57ce\u5e02\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528Mamba\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u5904\u7406\u65f6\u7a7a\u4f9d\u8d56\u548c\u57ce\u5e02\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u7ebd\u7ea6\u548c\u829d\u52a0\u54e5\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u57ce\u5e02\u4e8b\u6545\u6570\u636e\u5177\u6709\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u3001\u62a5\u544a\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u3001\u7a00\u758f\u3001\u5468\u671f\u6027\u3001\u566a\u58f0\u7b49\u56fa\u6709\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u52a0\u4e0a\u788e\u7247\u5316\u6cbb\u7406\u548c\u4e0d\u517c\u5bb9\u7684\u62a5\u544a\u6807\u51c6\uff0c\u963b\u788d\u4e86\u8de8\u57ce\u5e02\u4e8b\u6545\u9884\u9632\u6846\u67b6\u7684\u5efa\u7acb\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faMLA-STNet\u7edf\u4e00\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5c06\u4e8b\u6545\u98ce\u9669\u9884\u6d4b\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u8de8\u57ce\u5e02\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u5b66\u4e60\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u5305\u542b\u4e24\u4e2a\u4e92\u8865\u6a21\u5757\uff1aSTG-MA\uff08\u65f6\u7a7a\u5730\u7406Mamba\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\uff09\u6291\u5236\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u65f6\u7a7a\u6ce2\u52a8\u5e76\u589e\u5f3a\u957f\u7a0b\u65f6\u95f4\u4f9d\u8d56\uff1bSTS-MA\uff08\u65f6\u7a7a\u8bed\u4e49Mamba\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\uff09\u901a\u8fc7\u5171\u4eab\u53c2\u6570\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7f13\u89e3\u57ce\u5e02\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u7559\u4e2a\u4f53\u8bed\u4e49\u8868\u793a\u7a7a\u95f4\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u7ebd\u7ea6\u548c\u829d\u52a0\u54e5\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c75\u4e2a\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u5728\u5168\u5929\u548c\u9ad8\u9891\u4e8b\u6545\u65f6\u6bb5\u4e24\u79cd\u9884\u6d4b\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0cMLA-STNet\u5b9e\u73b0RMSE\u964d\u4f4e6%\u3001Recall\u63d0\u9ad88%\u3001MAP\u63d0\u9ad85%\uff0c\u572850%\u8f93\u5165\u566a\u58f0\u4e0b\u6027\u80fd\u53d8\u5316\u5c0f\u4e8e1%\u3002", "conclusion": "MLA-STNet\u6709\u6548\u7edf\u4e00\u4e86\u5f02\u8d28\u57ce\u5e02\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u3001\u9c81\u68d2\u4e14\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u8de8\u57ce\u5e02\u4e8b\u6545\u9884\u9632\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u4e3a\u534f\u8c03\u548c\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u57ce\u5e02\u5b89\u5168\u7ba1\u7406\u94fa\u5e73\u4e86\u9053\u8def\u3002"}}

Within this realm, Transformers have emerged as the predominant architecture due to their strong ability to capture pairwise dependencies. However, Transformer-based models suffer from quadratic computational complexity and high memory overhead, limiting their scalability and practical deployment in long-term and large-scale MTS modeling. Recently, Mamba has emerged as a promising linear-time alternative with high expressiveness. Nevertheless, directly applying vanilla Mamba to MTS remains suboptimal due to three key limitations: (i) the lack of explicit cross-variate modeling, (ii) difficulty in disentangling the entangled intra-series temporal dynamics and inter-series interactions, and (iii) insufficient modeling of latent time-lag interaction effects. These issues constrain its effectiveness across diverse MTS tasks. To address these challenges, we propose DeMa, a dual-path delay-aware Mamba backbone. DeMa preserves Mamba's linear-complexity advantage while substantially improving its suitability for MTS settings. Specifically, DeMa introduces three key innovations: (i) it decomposes the MTS into intra-series temporal dynamics and inter-series interactions; (ii) it develops a temporal path with a Mamba-SSD module to capture long-range dynamics within each individual series, enabling series-independent, parallel computation; and (iii) it designs a variate path with a Mamba-DALA module that integrates delay-aware linear attention to model cross-variate dependencies. Extensive experiments on five representative tasks, long- and short-term forecasting, data imputation, anomaly detection, and series classification, demonstrate that DeMa achieves state-of-the-art performance while delivering remarkable computational efficiency.", "AI": {"tldr": "DeMa\uff1a\u4e00\u79cd\u53cc\u8def\u5f84\u5ef6\u8fdf\u611f\u77e5Mamba\u9aa8\u5e72\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u591a\u53d8\u91cf\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u79bb\u65f6\u95f4\u52a8\u6001\u548c\u53d8\u91cf\u4ea4\u4e92\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u7ebf\u6027\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd", "motivation": "Transformer\u5728\u591a\u53d8\u91cf\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u5206\u6790\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u4e8c\u6b21\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u548c\u9ad8\u5185\u5b58\u5f00\u9500\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u800c\u76f4\u63a5\u5e94\u7528Mamba\u5b58\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u9650\u5236\uff1a\u7f3a\u4e4f\u663e\u5f0f\u8de8\u53d8\u91cf\u5efa\u6a21\u3001\u96be\u4ee5\u5206\u79bb\u65f6\u95f4\u52a8\u6001\u4e0e\u53d8\u91cf\u4ea4\u4e92\u3001\u5bf9\u6f5c\u5728\u65f6\u95f4\u6ede\u540e\u6548\u5e94\u5efa\u6a21\u4e0d\u8db3", "method": "\u63d0\u51faDeMa\u53cc\u8def\u5f84\u5ef6\u8fdf\u611f\u77e5Mamba\u9aa8\u5e72\u7f51\u7edc\uff1a1\uff09\u5c06MTS\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u65f6\u95f4\u52a8\u6001\u548c\u53d8\u91cf\u4ea4\u4e92\uff1b2\uff09\u65f6\u95f4\u8def\u5f84\u4f7f\u7528Mamba-SSD\u6a21\u5757\u6355\u83b7\u5355\u53d8\u91cf\u957f\u7a0b\u52a8\u6001\uff1b3\uff09\u53d8\u91cf\u8def\u5f84\u4f7f\u7528Mamba-DALA\u6a21\u5757\u96c6\u6210\u5ef6\u8fdf\u611f\u77e5\u7ebf\u6027\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5efa\u6a21\u8de8\u53d8\u91cf\u4f9d\u8d56", "result": "\u5728\u4e94\u4e2a\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u4efb\u52a1\uff08\u957f\u77ed\u671f\u9884\u6d4b\u3001\u6570\u636e\u63d2\u8865\u3001\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u3001\u5e8f\u5217\u5206\u7c7b\uff09\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u5353\u8d8a\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387", "conclusion": "DeMa\u5728\u4fdd\u6301Mamba\u7ebf\u6027\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u4f18\u52bf\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u591a\u53d8\u91cf\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u5efa\u6a21\u7684\u9002\u7528\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u9ad8\u6548MTS\u5206\u6790\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u524d\u666f\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848"}}

We call this the Linear Projection Bottleneck: in heterogeneous graphs, contextual diversity and long-tail shifts make a global head miss fine semantics, overfit hub nodes, and underserve tail nodes. While Mixture-of-Experts(MoE) could help, naively applying it clashes with structural imbalance and risks expert collapse. We propose a Heterogeneous-aware Orthogonal Prototype Experts framework named HOPE, a plug-and-play replacement for the standard prediction head. HOPE uses learnable prototype-based routing to assign instances to experts by similarity, letting expert usage follow the natural long-tail distribution, and adds expert orthogonalization to encourage diversity and prevent collapse. Experiments on four real datasets show consistent gains across SOTA HGNN backbones with minimal overhead.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faHOPE\u6846\u67b6\u89e3\u51b3\u5f02\u8d28\u56fe\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u7684\u7ebf\u6027\u6295\u5f71\u74f6\u9888\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u539f\u578b\u8def\u7531\u548c\u4e13\u5bb6\u6b63\u4ea4\u5316\u63d0\u5347\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709HGNNs\u7684\u89e3\u7801/\u6295\u5f71\u9636\u6bb5\u4ecd\u4f7f\u7528\u5355\u4e00\u5171\u4eab\u7ebf\u6027\u5934\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u5904\u7406\u5f02\u8d28\u56fe\u4e2d\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u591a\u6837\u6027\u548c\u957f\u5c3e\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5168\u5c40\u5934\u90e8\u9519\u8fc7\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u8bed\u4e49\u3001\u8fc7\u62df\u5408\u4e2d\u5fc3\u8282\u70b9\u3001\u5ffd\u89c6\u5c3e\u90e8\u8282\u70b9", "method": "\u63d0\u51faHOPE\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1) \u4f7f\u7528\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u539f\u578b\u7684\u8def\u7531\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\u5c06\u5b9e\u4f8b\u5206\u914d\u7ed9\u4e13\u5bb6\uff1b2) \u6dfb\u52a0\u4e13\u5bb6\u6b63\u4ea4\u5316\u4ee5\u9f13\u52b1\u591a\u6837\u6027\u5e76\u9632\u6b62\u4e13\u5bb6\u5d29\u6e83\uff1b3) \u4f5c\u4e3a\u5373\u63d2\u5373\u7528\u6a21\u5757\u66ff\u4ee3\u6807\u51c6\u9884\u6d4b\u5934", "result": "\u5728\u56db\u4e2a\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cHOPE\u5728\u591a\u79cdSOTA HGNN\u9aa8\u5e72\u7f51\u7edc\u4e0a\u5747\u53d6\u5f97\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u4e14\u5f00\u9500\u6781\u5c0f", "conclusion": "HOPE\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u5f02\u8d28\u56fe\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u7684\u7ebf\u6027\u6295\u5f71\u74f6\u9888\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u539f\u578b\u8def\u7531\u548c\u4e13\u5bb6\u6b63\u4ea4\u5316\u673a\u5236\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u5f02\u8d28\u56fe\u6570\u636e\u7684\u5904\u7406\u80fd\u529b"}}

This system is highly interpretable and allows predictions to be made with simple manual calculations without the need for a calculator. Several previous studies have used mixed-integer optimization (MIO) techniques to develop scoring systems for binary classification; however, they have not focused on directly maximizing AUC (i.e., area under the receiver operating characteristic curve), even though AUC is recognized as an essential evaluation metric for scoring systems. Our goal herein is to establish an effective MIO framework for constructing scoring systems that directly maximize the buffered AUC (bAUC) as the tightest concave lower bound on AUC. Our optimization model is formulated as a mixed-integer linear optimization (MILO) problem that maximizes bAUC subject to a group sparsity constraint for limiting the number of questions in the scoring system. Computational experiments using publicly available real-world datasets demonstrate that our MILO method can build scoring systems with superior AUC values compared to the baseline methods based on regularization and stepwise regression.

We propose a self-supervised approach for learning a JKO solution operator without requiring numerical solutions of any JKO trajectories. The learned operator maps an input density directly to the minimizer of the corresponding JKO subproblem, and can be iteratively applied to efficiently generate the gradient-flow evolution. A key challenge is that only a number of initial densities are typically available for training. To address this, we introduce a Learn-to-Evolve algorithm that jointly learns the JKO operator and its induced trajectories by alternating between trajectory generation and operator updates. As training progresses, the generated data increasingly approximates true JKO trajectories. Meanwhile, this Learn-to-Evolve strategy serves as a natural form of data augmentation, significantly enhancing the generalization ability of the learned operator. Numerical experiments demonstrate the accuracy, stability, and robustness of the proposed method across various choices of energies and initial conditions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u6570\u503c\u6c42\u89e3JKO\u5b50\u95ee\u9898\u5373\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60JKO\u89e3\u7b97\u5b50\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4ea4\u66ff\u8f68\u8ff9\u751f\u6210\u548c\u7b97\u5b50\u66f4\u65b0\u7684Learn-to-Evolve\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u9ad8\u6548\u8ba1\u7b97Wasserstein\u68af\u5ea6\u6d41\u3002", "motivation": "JKO\u65b9\u6848\u4e3a\u8ba1\u7b97Wasserstein\u68af\u5ea6\u6d41\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u53d8\u5206\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4f46\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7531\u4e8e\u9700\u8981\u53cd\u590d\u6c42\u89e3JKO\u5b50\u95ee\u9898\u800c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u6602\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5176\u5b9e\u9645\u4f7f\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b66\u4e60JKO\u89e3\u7b97\u5b50\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u4efb\u4f55JKO\u8f68\u8ff9\u7684\u6570\u503c\u89e3\u3002\u5f15\u5165Learn-to-Evolve\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4ea4\u66ff\u8fdb\u884c\u8f68\u8ff9\u751f\u6210\u548c\u7b97\u5b50\u66f4\u65b0\uff0c\u8054\u5408\u5b66\u4e60JKO\u7b97\u5b50\u53ca\u5176\u8bf1\u5bfc\u7684\u8f68\u8ff9\u3002", "result": "\u6570\u503c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5404\u79cd\u80fd\u91cf\u51fd\u6570\u548c\u521d\u59cb\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u90fd\u5177\u6709\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3001\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002\u5b66\u4e60\u5230\u7684\u7b97\u5b50\u80fd\u591f\u5c06\u8f93\u5165\u5bc6\u5ea6\u76f4\u63a5\u6620\u5c04\u5230\u5bf9\u5e94JKO\u5b50\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u89e3\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684Learn-to-Evolve\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86JKO\u65b9\u6848\u7684\u9ad8\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u901a\u8fc7\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u5b66\u4e60\u7b97\u5b50\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4e3aWasserstein\u68af\u5ea6\u6d41\u8ba1\u7b97\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u5b9e\u7528\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

PaCoRe departs from the traditional sequential paradigm by driving TTC through massive parallel exploration coordinated via a message-passing architecture in multiple rounds. Each round launches many parallel reasoning trajectories, compacts their findings into context-bounded messages, and synthesizes these messages to guide the next round and ultimately produce the final answer. Trained end-to-end with large-scale, outcome-based reinforcement learning, the model masters the synthesis abilities required by PaCoRe and scales to multi-million-token effective TTC without exceeding context limits. The approach yields strong improvements across diverse domains, and notably pushes reasoning beyond frontier systems in mathematics: an 8B model reaches 94.5% on HMMT 2025, surpassing GPT-5's 93.2% by scaling effective TTC to roughly two million tokens.

The method estimates treatment effects up to an error $\u03b5> 0$ in each of $M$ different strata of the population, targeting individuals in decreasing order of estimated treatment effect until the budget runs out. In general, this method requires $O(M/\u03b5^2)$ samples. This is best possible if the goal is to estimate all treatment effects up to an $\u03b5$ error. In this work, we show how to achieve the same total treatment effect as CATE with only $O(M/\u03b5)$ samples for natural distributions of treatment effects. The key insight is that coarse estimates suffice for near-optimal treatment allocations. In addition, we show that budget flexibility can further reduce the sample complexity of allocation. Finally, we evaluate our algorithm on various real-world RCT datasets. In all cases, it finds nearly optimal treatment allocations with surprisingly few samples.

However, existing RLVR algorithms focus on different granularities, and each has complementary strengths and limitations. Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) updates the policy with token-level importance ratios, which preserves fine-grained credit assignment but often suffers from high variance and instability. In contrast, Group Sequence Policy Optimization (GSPO) applies single sequence-level importance ratios across all tokens in a response that better matches sequence-level rewards, but sacrifices token-wise credit assignment. In this paper, we propose Dynamic Hybrid Policy Optimization (DHPO) to bridge GRPO and GSPO within a single clipped surrogate objective. DHPO combines token-level and sequence-level importance ratios using weighting mechanisms. We explore two variants of the mixing mechanism, including an averaged mixing and an entropy-guided mixing. To further stabilize training, we employ a branch-specific clipping strategy that constrains token-level and sequence-level ratios within separate trust regions before mixing, preventing outliers in either branch from dominating the update.

We propose PiXTime, a novel time series forecasting model designed for federated learning that enables effective prediction across nodes with multi-granularity and heterogeneous variable sets. PiXTime employs a personalized Patch Embedding to map node-specific granularity time series into token sequences of a unified dimension for processing by a subsequent shared model, and uses a global VE Table to align variable category semantics across nodes, thereby enhancing cross-node transferability. With a transformer-based shared model, PiXTime captures representations of auxiliary series with arbitrary numbers of variables and uses cross-attention to enhance the prediction of the target series.

During the first stage, a multi-turn dialogue strategy guides the model to generate CoT data incorporating verification, backtracking, subgoal decomposition, and backward reasoning, with predefined rules filtering high-quality samples for supervised fine-tuning. The second stage employs a difficulty-aware rejection sampling mechanism to dynamically optimize data distribution, strengthening the model's ability to handle complex problems. The approach generates reasoning chains extended over 4 times longer while maintaining strong scalability, proving that SFT effectively activates models' intrinsic reasoning capabilities and provides a resource-efficient pathway for complex task optimization.

However, an ideal CL agent should not only be able to overcome CF, but also encourage positive forward and backward knowledge transfer (KT), i.e., using the learned knowledge from previous tasks for the new task learning (namely FKT), and improving the previous tasks' performance with the knowledge of the new task (namely BKT). To this end, this paper first models CL as an optimization problem in which each sequential learning task aims to achieve its optimal performance under the constraint that both FKT and BKT should be positive. It then proposes a novel Enhanced Task Continual Learning (ETCL) method, which achieves forgetting-free and positive KT. Furthermore, the bounds that can lead to negative FKT and BKT are estimated theoretically. Based on the bounds, a new strategy for online task similarity detection is also proposed to facilitate positive KT. To overcome CF, ETCL learns a set of task-specific binary masks to isolate a sparse sub-network for each task while preserving the performance of a dense network for the task. At the beginning of a new task learning, ETCL tries to align the new task's gradient with that of the sub-network of the previous most similar task to ensure positive FKT. By using a new bi-objective optimization strategy and an orthogonal gradient projection method, ETCL updates only the weights of previous similar tasks at the classification layer to achieve positive BKT. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that the proposed ETCL markedly outperforms strong baselines on dissimilar, similar, and mixed task sequences.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faETCL\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u540c\u65f6\u89e3\u51b3\u707e\u96be\u6027\u9057\u5fd8\u95ee\u9898\u5e76\u4fc3\u8fdb\u6b63\u5411\u7684\u524d\u5411\u548c\u540e\u5411\u77e5\u8bc6\u8fc1\u79fb\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u5b9a\u63a9\u7801\u3001\u68af\u5ea6\u5bf9\u9f50\u548c\u53cc\u76ee\u6807\u4f18\u5316\u5b9e\u73b0\u65e0\u9057\u5fd8\u7684\u6b63\u5411\u77e5\u8bc6\u8fc1\u79fb\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u7814\u7a76\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u89e3\u51b3\u707e\u96be\u6027\u9057\u5fd8\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4f46\u7406\u60f3\u7684\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u4e0d\u4ec5\u5e94\u514b\u670d\u9057\u5fd8\uff0c\u8fd8\u5e94\u4fc3\u8fdb\u6b63\u5411\u7684\u524d\u5411\u77e5\u8bc6\u8fc1\u79fb\uff08\u7528\u5148\u524d\u4efb\u52a1\u77e5\u8bc6\u5b66\u4e60\u65b0\u4efb\u52a1\uff09\u548c\u540e\u5411\u77e5\u8bc6\u8fc1\u79fb\uff08\u7528\u65b0\u4efb\u52a1\u77e5\u8bc6\u6539\u8fdb\u5148\u524d\u4efb\u52a1\u6027\u80fd\uff09\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faETCL\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a1) \u5b66\u4e60\u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u5b9a\u4e8c\u8fdb\u5236\u63a9\u7801\u4e3a\u6bcf\u4e2a\u4efb\u52a1\u9694\u79bb\u7a00\u758f\u5b50\u7f51\u7edc\uff1b2) \u65b0\u4efb\u52a1\u5b66\u4e60\u5f00\u59cb\u65f6\uff0c\u5bf9\u9f50\u65b0\u4efb\u52a1\u68af\u5ea6\u4e0e\u5148\u524d\u6700\u76f8\u4f3c\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u5b50\u7f51\u7edc\u68af\u5ea6\u4ee5\u786e\u4fdd\u6b63\u5411FKT\uff1b3) \u4f7f\u7528\u53cc\u76ee\u6807\u4f18\u5316\u7b56\u7565\u548c\u6b63\u4ea4\u68af\u5ea6\u6295\u5f71\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ec5\u66f4\u65b0\u5148\u524d\u76f8\u4f3c\u4efb\u52a1\u5728\u5206\u7c7b\u5c42\u7684\u6743\u91cd\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u6b63\u5411BKT\uff1b4) \u7406\u8bba\u4f30\u8ba1\u5bfc\u81f4\u8d1f\u5411FKT\u548cBKT\u7684\u8fb9\u754c\uff0c\u5e76\u57fa\u4e8e\u6b64\u63d0\u51fa\u5728\u7ebf\u4efb\u52a1\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u68c0\u6d4b\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e0d\u76f8\u4f3c\u3001\u76f8\u4f3c\u548c\u6df7\u5408\u4efb\u52a1\u5e8f\u5217\u4e0a\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u8bc4\u4f30\u8868\u660e\uff0cETCL\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u5f3a\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u65e0\u9057\u5fd8\u548c\u6b63\u5411\u77e5\u8bc6\u8fc1\u79fb\u3002", "conclusion": "ETCL\u65b9\u6cd5\u6210\u529f\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u707e\u96be\u6027\u9057\u5fd8\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fc3\u8fdb\u4e86\u6b63\u5411\u7684\u524d\u5411\u548c\u540e\u5411\u77e5\u8bc6\u8fc1\u79fb\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u5b9a\u63a9\u7801\u3001\u68af\u5ea6\u5bf9\u9f50\u548c\u53cc\u76ee\u6807\u4f18\u5316\u7b56\u7565\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4f18\u5f02\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

These factors significantly degrade localisation accuracy, particularly when global models are applied without considering structural constraints. This paper introduces a clustering-based method that structures the fingerprint dataset prior to localisation. Fingerprints are grouped using either spatial or radio features, and clustering can be applied at the building or floor level. In the localisation phase, a clustering estimation procedure based on the strongest access points assigns unseen fingerprints to the most relevant cluster. Localisation is then performed only within the selected clusters, allowing learning models to operate on reduced and more coherent subsets of data. The effectiveness of the method is evaluated on three public datasets and several machine learning models. Results show a consistent reduction in localisation errors, particularly under building-level strategies, but at the cost of reducing the floor detection accuracy. These results demonstrate that explicitly structuring datasets through clustering is an effective and flexible approach for scalable indoor positioning.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u805a\u7c7b\u7684Wi-Fi\u6307\u7eb9\u5b9a\u4f4d\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u805a\u7c7b\u9884\u5904\u7406\u6307\u7eb9\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5728\u5b9a\u4f4d\u9636\u6bb5\u5148\u8fdb\u884c\u805a\u7c7b\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u518d\u5728\u9009\u5b9a\u7c07\u5185\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9a\u4f4d\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u5b9a\u4f4d\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edfWi-Fi\u6307\u7eb9\u5b9a\u4f4d\u9762\u4e34\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u89c4\u6a21\u4e0e\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u3001RSSI\u4fe1\u53f7\u6ce2\u52a8\u3001\u591a\u697c\u5c42\u73af\u5883\u6a21\u7cca\u6027\u7b49\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5b9a\u4f4d\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5168\u5c40\u6a21\u578b\u672a\u8003\u8651\u7ed3\u6784\u7ea6\u675f\u65f6\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u805a\u7c7b\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5b9a\u4f4d\u524d\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u6307\u7eb9\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u7a7a\u95f4\u6216\u65e0\u7ebf\u7279\u5f81\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u7ec4\uff0c\u53ef\u5728\u5efa\u7b51\u6216\u697c\u5c42\u7ea7\u522b\u5e94\u7528\u805a\u7c7b\u3002\u5b9a\u4f4d\u9636\u6bb5\u57fa\u4e8e\u6700\u5f3a\u63a5\u5165\u70b9\u7684\u805a\u7c7b\u4f30\u8ba1\u5c06\u65b0\u6307\u7eb9\u5206\u914d\u5230\u6700\u76f8\u5173\u7c07\uff0c\u4ec5\u5728\u9009\u5b9a\u7c07\u5185\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9a\u4f4d\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u516c\u5171\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u591a\u4e2a\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\u5b9a\u4f4d\u8bef\u5dee\u6301\u7eed\u964d\u4f4e\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u5efa\u7b51\u7ea7\u7b56\u7565\u4e0b\uff0c\u4f46\u4ee5\u964d\u4f4e\u697c\u5c42\u68c0\u6d4b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e3a\u4ee3\u4ef7\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u805a\u7c7b\u663e\u5f0f\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u662f\u6269\u5c55\u5ba4\u5185\u5b9a\u4f4d\u7684\u6709\u6548\u7075\u6d3b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u5b9a\u4f4d\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002"}}

Chen", "Somayeh Sojoudi"], "title": "Do Sparse Autoencoders Identify Reasoning Features in Language Models?", "comment": null, "summary": "We investigate whether sparse autoencoders (SAEs) identify genuine reasoning features in large language models (LLMs). Starting from features selected using standard contrastive activation methods, we introduce a falsification-oriented framework that combines causal token injection experiments and LLM-guided falsification to test whether feature activation reflects reasoning processes or superficial linguistic correlates. Across 20 configurations spanning multiple model families, layers, and reasoning datasets, we find that identified reasoning features are highly sensitive to token-level interventions. Injecting a small number of feature-associated tokens into non-reasoning text is sufficient to elicit strong activation for 59% to 94% of features, indicating reliance on lexical artifacts. For the remaining features that are not explained by simple token triggers, LLM-guided falsification consistently produces non-reasoning inputs that activate the feature and reasoning inputs that do not, with no analyzed feature satisfying our criteria for genuine reasoning behavior. Steering these features yields minimal changes or slight degradations in benchmark performance.

To address the challenge, we propose AGDC, a novel unified framework that jointly models discrete and continuous values for variable-length sequences. AGDC employs a hybrid approach that combines categorical prediction for discrete values with diffusion-based modeling for continuous values, incorporating two key technical components: an end-of-sequence (EOS) logit adjustment mechanism that uses an MLP to dynamically adjust EOS token logits based on sequence context, and a length regularization term integrated into the loss function. Additionally, we present ContLayNet, a large-scale benchmark comprising 334K high-precision semiconductor layout samples with specialized evaluation metrics that capture functional correctness where precision errors significantly impact performance.

However, unconstrained residual matrices can compromise training stability. To address this, DeepSeek's Manifold-Constrained Hyper-Connections (mHC) approximately projects these matrices onto the Birkhoff polytope via iterative Sinkhorn--Knopp (SK) normalization. We identify two limitations of this approach: (i) finite SK iterations do not guarantee exact doubly stochasticity, leaving an approximation gap that can accumulate through network depth and undermine stability; (ii) efficient SK implementation requires highly specialized CUDA kernels, raising engineering barriers and reducing portability. Motivated by the Birkhoff--von Neumann theorem, we propose mHC-lite, a simple reparameterization that explicitly constructs doubly stochastic matrices as convex combinations of permutation matrices.

This study reframes P-wave arrival detection as a self-supervised anomaly detection task to evaluate how architectural variations regulate the trade-off between reconstruction fidelity and anomaly discrimination. Through a comprehensive grid search of 492 Variational Autoencoder configurations, we show that while skip connections minimize reconstruction error (Mean Absolute Error approximately 0.0012), they induce \"overgeneralization\", allowing the model to reconstruct noise and masking the detection signal. In contrast, attention mechanisms prioritize global context over local detail and yield the highest detection performance with an area-under-the-curve of 0.875. The attention-based Variational Autoencoder achieves an area-under-the-curve of 0.91 in the 0 to 40-kilometer near-source range, demonstrating high suitability for immediate early warning applications.

However, extending this paradigm to Transformer is hindered by superposition, where entangled features encoded in overlapping directions obstruct the extraction of symbolic expressions. In this work, we propose the Discrete Transformer, an architecture explicitly engineered to bridge the gap between continuous representations and discrete symbolic logic. By enforcing a strict functional disentanglement, which constrains Numerical Attention to information routing and Numerical MLP to element-wise arithmetic, and employing temperature-annealed sampling, our method effectively facilitates the extraction of human-readable programs. Empirically, the Discrete Transformer not only achieves performance comparable to RNN-based baselines but crucially extends interpretability to continuous variable domains. Moreover, our analysis of the annealing process shows that the efficient discrete search undergoes a clear phase transition from exploration to exploitation. We further demonstrate that our method enables fine-grained control over synthesized programs by imposing inductive biases.

We propose Tensor-DTI, a contrastive learning framework that integrates multimodal embeddings from molecular graphs, protein language models, and binding-site predictions to improve interaction modeling. Tensor-DTI employs a siamese dual-encoder architecture, enabling it to capture both chemical and structural interaction features while distinguishing interacting from non-interacting pairs. Evaluations on multiple DTI benchmarks demonstrate that Tensor-DTI outperforms existing sequence-based and graph-based models. We also conduct large-scale inference experiments on CDK2 across billion-scale chemical libraries, where Tensor-DTI produces chemically plausible hit distributions even when CDK2 is withheld from training. In enrichment studies against Glide docking and Boltz-2 co-folder, Tensor-DTI remains competitive on CDK2 and improves the screening budget required to recover moderate fractions of high-affinity ligands on out-of-family targets under strict family-holdout splits. Additionally, we explore its applicability to protein-RNA and peptide-protein interactions.

In this paper, we study whether the fusion mechanism itself affects performance, particularly in long-sequence settings. We conduct a controlled empirical study comparing three canonical fusion strategies--element-wise addition, concatenation with projection, and scalar gated fusion--under identical Transformer architectures, data splits, and random seeds. Experiments on three text classification datasets spanning short (AG News), medium (IMDB), and long (ArXiv) sequences show that fusion choice has negligible impact on short texts but produces consistent gains on long documents. To verify that these gains are structural rather than stochastic, we perform paired-seed analysis and cross-dataset comparison across sequence-length regimes. Additional experiments on the ArXiv dataset indicate that the benefit of learnable fusion generalizes across multiple positional encoding families. Finally, we explore a lightweight convolutional gating mechanism that introduces local inductive bias at the fusion level, evaluated on long documents only. Our results indicate that positional-encoding fusion is a non-trivial design choice for long-sequence Transformers and should be treated as an explicit modeling decision rather than a fixed default.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u4f4d\u7f6e\u7f16\u7801\u4e0e\u8bcd\u5d4c\u5165\u7684\u878d\u5408\u673a\u5236\u5bf9Transformer\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5728\u957f\u5e8f\u5217\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u878d\u5408\u7b56\u7565\u9009\u62e9\u5bf9\u6027\u80fd\u6709\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd", "motivation": "\u5927\u591a\u6570\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u5173\u6ce8\u8bbe\u8ba1\u65b0\u7684\u4f4d\u7f6e\u7f16\u7801\uff0c\u800c\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u4f4d\u7f6e\u4fe1\u606f\u4e0e\u8bcd\u5d4c\u5165\u7684\u878d\u5408\u673a\u5236\u672c\u8eab\u53ef\u80fd\u5f71\u54cd\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u957f\u5e8f\u5217\u573a\u666f\u4e0b", "method": "\u5728\u76f8\u540cTransformer\u67b6\u6784\u3001\u6570\u636e\u5212\u5206\u548c\u968f\u673a\u79cd\u5b50\u4e0b\uff0c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u4e09\u79cd\u7ecf\u5178\u878d\u5408\u7b56\u7565\uff1a\u9010\u5143\u7d20\u52a0\u6cd5\u3001\u62fc\u63a5\u52a0\u6295\u5f71\u3001\u6807\u91cf\u95e8\u63a7\u878d\u5408\uff1b\u5728\u77ed\u3001\u4e2d\u3001\u957f\u4e09\u79cd\u5e8f\u5217\u957f\u5ea6\u7684\u6587\u672c\u5206\u7c7b\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff1b\u4f7f\u7528\u914d\u5bf9\u79cd\u5b50\u5206\u6790\u548c\u8de8\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u6bd4\u8f83\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7ed3\u679c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027", "result": "\u878d\u5408\u9009\u62e9\u5bf9\u77ed\u6587\u672c\u5f71\u54cd\u53ef\u5ffd\u7565\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u957f\u6587\u6863\u4e0a\u4ea7\u751f\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\uff1b\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u878d\u5408\u673a\u5236\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u4f4d\u7f6e\u7f16\u7801\u5bb6\u65cf\u4e2d\u90fd\u80fd\u5e26\u6765\u6536\u76ca\uff1b\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u5377\u79ef\u95e8\u63a7\u673a\u5236\u5728\u957f\u6587\u6863\u4e0a\u5f15\u5165\u5c40\u90e8\u5f52\u7eb3\u504f\u7f6e", "conclusion": "\u4f4d\u7f6e\u7f16\u7801\u878d\u5408\u662f\u957f\u5e8f\u5217Transformer\u4e2d\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u9009\u62e9\uff0c\u5e94\u4f5c\u4e3a\u660e\u786e\u7684\u5efa\u6a21\u51b3\u7b56\u800c\u975e\u56fa\u5b9a\u9ed8\u8ba4\u8bbe\u7f6e"}}

Each observation is first reconstructed as a linear combination of the other samples in the RKHS, by optimizing a vector form of the Representer Theorem for their autorepresentation property. A separable operator-valued kernel extends the formulation to vector-valued data while retaining the simplicity of a single scalar similarity function. A subsequent kernel-alignment task projects the data into a lower-dimensional latent space whose Gram matrix aims to match the high-dimensional reconstruction kernel, thus transferring the auto-reconstruction geometry of the RKHS to the embedding. Therefore, the proposed algorithms represent an extended approach to the autorepresentation property, exhibited by many natural data, by using and adapting well-known results of Kernel Learning Theory. Numerical experiments on both simulated (concentric circles and swiss-roll) and real (cancer molecular activity and IoT network intrusions) datasets provide empirical evidence of the practical effectiveness of the proposed approach.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8eRKHS\u7684\u81ea\u8868\u793a\u6d41\u5f62\u5b66\u4e60\u65b0\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6838\u5bf9\u9f50\u5c06\u9ad8\u7ef4\u6570\u636e\u7684\u81ea\u91cd\u6784\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\u8f6c\u79fb\u5230\u4f4e\u7ef4\u5d4c\u5165\u7a7a\u95f4\u3002", "motivation": "\u53d7\u8868\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u63ed\u793a\u9ad8\u7ef4\u6570\u636e\u6f5c\u5728\u7ed3\u6784\u65b9\u9762\u65e5\u76ca\u589e\u957f\u7684\u5174\u8da3\u9a71\u52a8\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u5f00\u53d1\u80fd\u591f\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u6355\u6349\u6570\u636e\u5185\u5728\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u6d41\u5f62\u5b66\u4e60\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "1. \u5728RKHS\u4e2d\uff0c\u5c06\u6bcf\u4e2a\u89c2\u6d4b\u503c\u91cd\u6784\u4e3a\u5176\u4ed6\u6837\u672c\u7684\u7ebf\u6027\u7ec4\u5408\uff0c\u4f18\u5316\u5411\u91cf\u5f62\u5f0f\u7684\u8868\u793a\u5b9a\u7406\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u81ea\u8868\u793a\u7279\u6027\u30022. \u4f7f\u7528\u53ef\u5206\u79bb\u7684\u7b97\u5b50\u503c\u6838\u5c06\u65b9\u6cd5\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u5411\u91cf\u503c\u6570\u636e\u30023. \u901a\u8fc7\u6838\u5bf9\u9f50\u4efb\u52a1\u5c06\u6570\u636e\u6295\u5f71\u5230\u4f4e\u7ef4\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u4f7f\u5176Gram\u77e9\u9635\u5339\u914d\u9ad8\u7ef4\u91cd\u6784\u6838\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5c06RKHS\u7684\u81ea\u91cd\u6784\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\u8f6c\u79fb\u5230\u5d4c\u5165\u4e2d\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6a21\u62df\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff08\u540c\u5fc3\u5706\u548c\u745e\u58eb\u5377\uff09\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff08\u764c\u75c7\u5206\u5b50\u6d3b\u6027\u548c\u7269\u8054\u7f51\u7f51\u7edc\u5165\u4fb5\uff09\u4e0a\u7684\u6570\u503c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7ecf\u9a8c\u8bc1\u636e\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u5177\u6709\u5b9e\u9645\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u5229\u7528\u548c\u8c03\u6574\u6838\u5b66\u4e60\u7406\u8bba\u7684\u5df2\u77e5\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u81ea\u7136\u6570\u636e\u666e\u904d\u5b58\u5728\u7684\u81ea\u8868\u793a\u7279\u6027\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e3a\u6d41\u5f62\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684RKHS\u6846\u67b6\u3002"}}

Eye movement data offers a non-invasive diagnostic tool for ASD detection, as it is inherently discrete and exhibits short-term temporal dependencies, reflecting localized gaze focus between fixation points. These characteristics enable the data to provide deeper insights into subtle behavioral markers, distinguishing ASD-related patterns from typical development. Eye movement signals mainly contain short-term and localized dependencies. However, despite the widespread application of stacked attention layers in Transformer-based models for capturing long-range dependencies, our experimental results indicate that this approach yields only limited benefits when applied to eye movement data. This may be because discrete fixation points and short-term dependencies in gaze focus reduce the utility of global attention mechanisms, making them less efficient than architectures focusing on local temporal patterns. To efficiently capture subtle and complex eye movement patterns, distinguishing ASD from typically developing (TD) individuals, a discrete short-term sequential (DSTS) modeling framework is designed with Class-aware Representation and Imbalance-aware Mechanisms. Through extensive experiments on several eye movement datasets, DSTS outperforms both traditional machine learning techniques and more sophisticated deep learning models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faDSTS\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7c7b\u611f\u77e5\u8868\u793a\u548c\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u611f\u77e5\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u6355\u6349\u773c\u52a8\u6570\u636e\u7684\u77ed\u671f\u5c40\u90e8\u4f9d\u8d56\uff0c\u5728\u81ea\u95ed\u75c7\u8c31\u7cfb\u969c\u788d\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e2d\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u81ea\u95ed\u75c7\u8c31\u7cfb\u969c\u788d\uff08ASD\uff09\u7684\u8bca\u65ad\u9700\u8981\u975e\u4fb5\u5165\u6027\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u773c\u52a8\u6570\u636e\u5177\u6709\u79bb\u6563\u6027\u548c\u77ed\u671f\u65f6\u95f4\u4f9d\u8d56\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709Transformer\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5168\u5c40\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u5bf9\u8fd9\u7c7b\u6570\u636e\u6548\u679c\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e13\u95e8\u9488\u5bf9\u773c\u52a8\u6570\u636e\u7279\u70b9\u7684\u5efa\u6a21\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u79bb\u6563\u77ed\u671f\u5e8f\u5217\uff08DSTS\uff09\u5efa\u6a21\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u7c7b\u611f\u77e5\u8868\u793a\u673a\u5236\u548c\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u611f\u77e5\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u4e13\u95e8\u9488\u5bf9\u773c\u52a8\u6570\u636e\u7684\u79bb\u6563\u6027\u548c\u77ed\u671f\u5c40\u90e8\u4f9d\u8d56\u7279\u6027\u8fdb\u884c\u5efa\u6a21\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u773c\u52a8\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cDSTS\u6846\u67b6\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u66f4\u590d\u6742\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u533a\u5206ASD\u60a3\u8005\u548c\u5178\u578b\u53d1\u80b2\u4e2a\u4f53\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9488\u5bf9\u773c\u52a8\u6570\u636e\u7684\u79bb\u6563\u6027\u548c\u77ed\u671f\u4f9d\u8d56\u7279\u6027\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684DSTS\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7c7b\u611f\u77e5\u548c\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u611f\u77e5\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u5730\u6355\u6349ASD\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u5fae\u5999\u773c\u52a8\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u4e3aASD\u8bca\u65ad\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u7684\u975e\u4fb5\u5165\u6027\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

However, clinical sleep studies are resource intensive and are difficult to scale for population level screening. This paper presents a Dual Pipeline Machine Learning Framework for multi class sleep disorder screening using the Sleep Health and Lifestyle dataset. The framework consists of two parallel processing streams: a statistical pipeline that targets linear separability using Mutual Information and Linear Discriminant Analysis, and a wrapper based pipeline that applies Boruta feature selection with an autoencoder for non linear representation learning. To address class imbalance, we use the hybrid SMOTETomek resampling strategy. In experiments, Extra Trees and K Nearest Neighbors achieved an accuracy of 98.67%, outperforming recent baselines on the same dataset. Statistical testing using the Wilcoxon Signed Rank Test indicates that the improvement over baseline configurations is significant, and inference latency remains below 400 milliseconds. These results suggest that the proposed dual pipeline design supports accurate and efficient automated screening for non invasive sleep disorder risk stratification.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u53cc\u7ba1\u9053\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7edf\u8ba1\u548c\u5305\u88c5\u5668\u4e24\u6761\u5e76\u884c\u5904\u7406\u6d41\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408SMOTETomek\u5904\u7406\u7c7b\u522b\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\uff0c\u5728\u7761\u7720\u969c\u788d\u7b5b\u67e5\u4e2d\u8fbe\u523098.67%\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002", "motivation": "\u7761\u7720\u969c\u788d\uff08\u5982\u5931\u7720\u548c\u7761\u7720\u547c\u5438\u6682\u505c\uff09\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u5206\u7c7b\u5bf9\u964d\u4f4e\u957f\u671f\u5065\u5eb7\u98ce\u9669\u548c\u6539\u5584\u60a3\u8005\u751f\u6d3b\u8d28\u91cf\u5f88\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u4e34\u5e8a\u7761\u7720\u7814\u7a76\u8d44\u6e90\u5bc6\u96c6\u4e14\u96be\u4ee5\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u4eba\u7fa4\u7b5b\u67e5\u89c4\u6a21\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u53cc\u7ba1\u9053\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1\uff09\u7edf\u8ba1\u7ba1\u9053\u4f7f\u7528\u4e92\u4fe1\u606f\u548c\u7ebf\u6027\u5224\u522b\u5206\u6790\u5904\u7406\u7ebf\u6027\u53ef\u5206\u6027\uff1b2\uff09\u5305\u88c5\u5668\u7ba1\u9053\u4f7f\u7528Boruta\u7279\u5f81\u9009\u62e9\u548c\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u8fdb\u884c\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u8868\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\u3002\u91c7\u7528SMOTETomek\u6df7\u5408\u91cd\u91c7\u6837\u7b56\u7565\u5904\u7406\u7c7b\u522b\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u3002", "result": "Extra Trees\u548cK\u6700\u8fd1\u90bb\u7b97\u6cd5\u8fbe\u523098.67%\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u76f8\u540c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u8fd1\u671f\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002Wilcoxon\u7b26\u53f7\u79e9\u68c0\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u6539\u8fdb\u5177\u6709\u7edf\u8ba1\u663e\u8457\u6027\uff0c\u63a8\u7406\u5ef6\u8fdf\u4fdd\u6301\u5728400\u6beb\u79d2\u4ee5\u4e0b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u53cc\u7ba1\u9053\u8bbe\u8ba1\u652f\u6301\u51c6\u786e\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u7b5b\u67e5\uff0c\u53ef\u7528\u4e8e\u975e\u4fb5\u5165\u6027\u7761\u7720\u969c\u788d\u98ce\u9669\u5206\u5c42\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u4e34\u5e8a\u5e94\u7528\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

While many variants of Poisson NMF exist, existing methods assume that the \"parts\" in the decomposition combine additively. This assumption may be natural in some settings, but not in others. Here we introduce Poisson NMF with the shifted-log link function to relax this assumption. The shifted-log link function has a single tuning parameter, and as this parameter varies the model changes from assuming that parts combine additively (i.e., standard Poisson NMF) to assuming that parts combine more multiplicatively. We provide an algorithm to fit this model by maximum likelihood, and also an approximation that substantially reduces computation time for large, sparse datasets (computations scale with the number of non-zero entries in the data matrix). We illustrate these new methods on a variety of real datasets. Our examples show how the choice of link function in Poisson NMF can substantively impact the results, and how in some settings the use of a shifted-log link function may improve interpretability compared with the standard, additive link.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5e26\u79fb\u4f4d\u5bf9\u6570\u94fe\u63a5\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u6cca\u677e\u975e\u8d1f\u77e9\u9635\u5206\u89e3\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53ef\u8c03\u53c2\u6570\u5728\u52a0\u6027\u548c\u4e58\u6027\u7ec4\u5408\u4e4b\u95f4\u7075\u6d3b\u8f6c\u6362\uff0c\u6539\u8fdb\u8ba1\u6570\u6570\u636e\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u5206\u89e3\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u6cca\u677eNMF\u5047\u8bbe\u5206\u89e3\u7684\"\u90e8\u5206\"\u4ee5\u52a0\u6027\u65b9\u5f0f\u7ec4\u5408\uff0c\u8fd9\u5728\u67d0\u4e9b\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u4e0d\u81ea\u7136\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u66f4\u7075\u6d3b\u7684\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5141\u8bb8\u90e8\u5206\u4ee5\u66f4\u4e58\u6027\u7684\u65b9\u5f0f\u7ec4\u5408\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e0d\u540c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u5e26\u79fb\u4f4d\u5bf9\u6570\u94fe\u63a5\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u6cca\u677eNMF\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5355\u4e2a\u8c03\u4f18\u53c2\u6570\u63a7\u5236\u4ece\u52a0\u6027\u5230\u4e58\u6027\u7ec4\u5408\u7684\u8fde\u7eed\u53d8\u5316\u3002\u63d0\u51fa\u6700\u5927\u4f3c\u7136\u4f30\u8ba1\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u5927\u578b\u7a00\u758f\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u63d0\u4f9b\u8ba1\u7b97\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u8fd1\u4f3c\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u4e0e\u6570\u636e\u77e9\u9635\u975e\u96f6\u5143\u7d20\u6570\u91cf\u6210\u6b63\u6bd4\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\u94fe\u63a5\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u9009\u62e9\u5bf9\u5206\u89e3\u7ed3\u679c\u6709\u5b9e\u8d28\u6027\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5728\u67d0\u4e9b\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u79fb\u4f4d\u5bf9\u6570\u94fe\u63a5\u51fd\u6570\u76f8\u6bd4\u6807\u51c6\u52a0\u6027\u94fe\u63a5\u80fd\u63d0\u9ad8\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u79fb\u4f4d\u5bf9\u6570\u94fe\u63a5\u51fd\u6570\u4e3a\u6cca\u677eNMF\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4ece\u52a0\u6027\u5230\u4e58\u6027\u7ec4\u5408\u7684\u7075\u6d3b\u5efa\u6a21\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u80fd\u6839\u636e\u6570\u636e\u7279\u6027\u9009\u62e9\u5408\u9002\u7ec4\u5408\u65b9\u5f0f\uff0c\u6539\u8fdb\u5206\u89e3\u7ed3\u679c\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u5927\u578b\u7a00\u758f\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u63d0\u4f9b\u9ad8\u6548\u8ba1\u7b97\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

The semantic homogeneity of random rollouts often traps models in narrow, over-optimized behaviors. While existing methods leverage policy entropy to encourage exploration, they face inherent limitations. Global entropy regularization is susceptible to reward hacking, which can induce meaningless verbosity, whereas local token-selective updates struggle with the strong inductive bias of pre-trained models. To address this, we propose Latent Policy Optimization via Iterative Information Bottleneck (IIB-LPO), a novel approach that shifts exploration from statistical perturbation of token distributions to topological branching of reasoning trajectories. IIB-LPO triggers latent branching at high-entropy states to diversify reasoning paths and employs the Information Bottleneck principle both as a trajectory filter and a self-reward mechanism, ensuring concise and informative exploration. Empirical results across four mathematical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that IIB-LPO achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing prior methods by margins of up to 5.3% in accuracy and 7.4% in diversity metrics.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faIIB-LPO\u65b9\u6cd5\u89e3\u51b3RLVR\u4e2d\u63a2\u7d22\u5d29\u6e83\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6f5c\u5728\u5206\u652f\u548c\u4fe1\u606f\u74f6\u9888\u5b9e\u73b0\u591a\u6837\u5316\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u5728\u6570\u5b66\u63a8\u7406\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97SOTA\u6027\u80fd", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709RLVR\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u63a2\u7d22\u5d29\u6e83\u95ee\u9898\uff1a\u968f\u673arollout\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u540c\u8d28\u6027\u5bfc\u81f4\u6a21\u578b\u9677\u5165\u72ed\u7a84\u3001\u8fc7\u5ea6\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u3002\u5168\u5c40\u71b5\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u5bb9\u6613\u5956\u52b1\u653b\u51fb\u5bfc\u81f4\u65e0\u610f\u4e49\u5197\u957f\uff0c\u5c40\u90e8token\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u66f4\u65b0\u5219\u53d7\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u5f3a\u5f52\u7eb3\u504f\u5dee\u9650\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faIIB-LPO\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a\u5c06\u63a2\u7d22\u4ecetoken\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u7edf\u8ba1\u6270\u52a8\u8f6c\u5411\u63a8\u7406\u8f68\u8ff9\u7684\u62d3\u6251\u5206\u652f\u3002\u5728\u9ad8\u71b5\u72b6\u6001\u89e6\u53d1\u6f5c\u5728\u5206\u652f\u4ee5\u591a\u6837\u5316\u63a8\u7406\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u5e76\u4f7f\u7528\u4fe1\u606f\u74f6\u9888\u539f\u5219\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8f68\u8ff9\u8fc7\u6ee4\u5668\u548c\u81ea\u5956\u52b1\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u7b80\u6d01\u4e14\u4fe1\u606f\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u63a2\u7d22\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u56db\u4e2a\u6570\u5b66\u63a8\u7406\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0cIIB-LPO\u8fbe\u5230\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5728\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4e0a\u6bd4\u5148\u524d\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u5347\u9ad8\u8fbe5.3%\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u6837\u6027\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u63d0\u5347\u9ad8\u8fbe7.4%\u3002", "conclusion": "IIB-LPO\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u63a2\u7d22\u4ece\u7edf\u8ba1\u6270\u52a8\u8f6c\u5411\u62d3\u6251\u5206\u652f\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86RLVR\u4e2d\u7684\u63a2\u7d22\u5d29\u6e83\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u548c\u591a\u6837\u5316\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u8def\u5f84\u63a2\u7d22\u3002"}}

A common strategy is to divide the domain into several regions (patches) and simplify the equation in each region. When approximate analytic solutions can be obtained in each patch, they are then matched at the interfaces to construct a global solution. However, this patching procedure can fail to reproduce the correct solution, since the approximate forms may break down near the matching boundaries. In this work, we propose a learning framework in which the integration constants of asymptotic analytic solutions are promoted to scale-dependent functions. By constraining these coefficient functions with the original differential equation over the domain, the network learns a globally valid solution that smoothly interpolates between asymptotic regimes, eliminating the need for arbitrary boundary matching. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this framework in representative problems from chemical kinetics and cosmology, where it accurately reproduces global solutions and outperforms conventional matching procedures.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u6e10\u8fd1\u89e3\u6790\u89e3\u7684\u79ef\u5206\u5e38\u6570\u63d0\u5347\u4e3a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u76f8\u5173\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ea6\u675f\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7cfb\u6570\u51fd\u6570\u6765\u5b66\u4e60\u5168\u5c40\u6709\u6548\u89e3\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u8fb9\u754c\u5339\u914d\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u7269\u7406\u548c\u5de5\u7a0b\u4e2d\uff0c\u590d\u6742\u5fae\u5206\u65b9\u7a0b\u901a\u5e38\u5177\u6709\u5f3a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u83b7\u5f97\u7cbe\u786e\u89e3\u6790\u6216\u6570\u503c\u89e3\u3002\u4f20\u7edf\u5206\u533a\u57df\u7b80\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5339\u914d\u8fb9\u754c\u5904\u53ef\u80fd\u5931\u6548\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u8fd1\u4f3c\u5f62\u5f0f\u5728\u8fb9\u754c\u9644\u8fd1\u53ef\u80fd\u4e0d\u6210\u7acb\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff1a\u5c06\u6e10\u8fd1\u89e3\u6790\u89e3\u7684\u79ef\u5206\u5e38\u6570\u63d0\u5347\u4e3a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u76f8\u5173\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ea6\u675f\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7cfb\u6570\u51fd\u6570\u6ee1\u8db3\u539f\u59cb\u5fae\u5206\u65b9\u7a0b\uff0c\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u5b66\u4e60\u5168\u5c40\u6709\u6548\u89e3\uff0c\u5e73\u6ed1\u63d2\u503c\u4e0d\u540c\u6e10\u8fd1\u533a\u57df\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5316\u5b66\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u548c\u5b87\u5b99\u5b66\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u51c6\u786e\u518d\u73b0\u5168\u5c40\u89e3\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u5339\u914d\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u79ef\u5206\u5e38\u6570\u63a8\u5e7f\u4e3a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u76f8\u5173\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u6e10\u8fd1\u533a\u57df\u95f4\u7684\u5e73\u6ed1\u63d2\u503c\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u4e86\u4efb\u610f\u8fb9\u754c\u5339\u914d\uff0c\u4e3a\u590d\u6742\u5fae\u5206\u65b9\u7a0b\u6c42\u89e3\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

However, in real-world deployments, auditing is complicated by the fact that model owners may adaptively update their models in response to changing environments, such as financial markets. These updates can alter the underlying model class while preserving certain properties of interest, raising fundamental questions about what can be reliably audited under such shifts.\n  In this work, we study group fairness auditing under arbitrary updates. We consider general shifts that modify the pre-audit model class while maintaining invariance of the audited property. Our goals are two-fold: (i) to characterize the information complexity of allowable updates, by identifying which strategic changes preserve the property under audit; and (ii) to efficiently estimate auditing properties, such as group fairness, using a minimal number of labeled samples.\n  We propose a generic framework for PAC auditing based on an Empirical Property Optimization (EPO) oracle. For statistical parity, we establish distribution-free auditing bounds characterized by the SP dimension, a novel combinatorial measure that captures the complexity of admissible strategic updates. Finally, we demonstrate that our framework naturally extends to other auditing objectives, including prediction error and robust risk.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u7528\u4e8e\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u66f4\u65b0\u4e0b\u7684\u7fa4\u4f53\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u5ba1\u8ba1\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7SP\u7ef4\u5ea6\u91cf\u5316\u53ef\u5141\u8bb8\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u66f4\u65b0\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u6837\u672c\u9ad8\u6548\u7684PAC\u5ba1\u8ba1\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u4e2d\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u4f1a\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u66f4\u65b0\uff08\u5982\u91d1\u878d\u5e02\u573a\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\uff09\uff0c\u8fd9\u79cd\u66f4\u65b0\u53ef\u80fd\u6539\u53d8\u6a21\u578b\u7c7b\u522b\u4f46\u4fdd\u6301\u67d0\u4e9b\u5ba1\u8ba1\u5c5e\u6027\u4e0d\u53d8\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u7814\u7a76\u5728\u8fd9\u79cd\u53d8\u5316\u4e0b\u5982\u4f55\u8fdb\u884c\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u5ba1\u8ba1\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u7ecf\u9a8c\u5c5e\u6027\u4f18\u5316\uff08EPO\uff09oracle\u7684\u901a\u7528PAC\u5ba1\u8ba1\u6846\u67b6\u3002\u5bf9\u4e8e\u7edf\u8ba1\u516c\u5e73\u6027\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u7531SP\u7ef4\u5ea6\uff08\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u7ec4\u5408\u5ea6\u91cf\uff09\u8868\u5f81\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u65e0\u5173\u5ba1\u8ba1\u754c\u9650\uff0c\u8be5\u7ef4\u5ea6\u6355\u6349\u4e86\u53ef\u5141\u8bb8\u7b56\u7565\u66f4\u65b0\u7684\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u7fa4\u4f53\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u5ba1\u8ba1\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5904\u7406\u4efb\u610f\u6a21\u578b\u66f4\u65b0\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7SP\u7ef4\u5ea6\u91cf\u5316\u66f4\u65b0\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u3002\u6846\u67b6\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u5176\u4ed6\u5ba1\u8ba1\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u5982\u9884\u6d4b\u8bef\u5dee\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u98ce\u9669\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u5de5\u4f5c\u4e3a\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u66f4\u65b0\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u7684\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u5ba1\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\u548c\u5b9e\u7528\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u5b9e\u90e8\u7f72\u4e2d\u6a21\u578b\u52a8\u6001\u53d8\u5316\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u5ba1\u8ba1\u6311\u6218\u3002"}}

In this paper, we address the scenario in which only a few classes and their associated intermediate concepts are relevant to distill. This scenario is common in practice, yet few existing distillation methods explicitly focus on the relevant subtask. To address this gap, we introduce 'SubDistill', a new distillation algorithm with improved numerical properties that only distills the relevant components of the teacher model at each layer. Experiments on CIFAR-100 and ImageNet with Convolutional and Transformer models demonstrate that SubDistill outperforms existing layer-wise distillation techniques on a representative set of subtasks. Our benchmark evaluations are complemented by Explainable AI analyses showing that our distilled student models more closely match the decision structure of the original teacher model.", "AI": {"tldr": "SubDistill\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e13\u6ce8\u4e8e\u4ec5\u84b8\u998f\u6559\u5e08\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u4e0e\u7279\u5b9a\u5b50\u4efb\u52a1\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff0c\u5728\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\u6709\u9650\u7684\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u8fc1\u79fb\u3002", "motivation": "\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u901a\u5e38\u53ea\u9700\u8981\u84b8\u998f\u5c11\u6570\u7c7b\u522b\u53ca\u5176\u76f8\u5173\u4e2d\u95f4\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u84b8\u998f\u65b9\u6cd5\u5f88\u5c11\u660e\u786e\u5173\u6ce8\u76f8\u5173\u5b50\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u8d44\u6e90\u6d6a\u8d39\u548c\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u4e0b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faSubDistill\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u6539\u8fdb\u7684\u6570\u503c\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u6bcf\u4e00\u5c42\u4ec5\u84b8\u998f\u6559\u5e08\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u76f8\u5173\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff0c\u4e13\u6ce8\u4e8e\u7279\u5b9a\u5b50\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u8fc1\u79fb\u3002", "result": "\u5728CIFAR-100\u548cImageNet\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u5377\u79ef\u548cTransformer\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cSubDistill\u5728\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u5b50\u4efb\u52a1\u96c6\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u9010\u5c42\u84b8\u998f\u6280\u672f\u3002", "conclusion": "SubDistill\u901a\u8fc7\u4e13\u6ce8\u4e8e\u76f8\u5173\u5b50\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\uff0c\u4e0d\u4ec5\u6027\u80fd\u66f4\u4f18\uff0c\u800c\u4e14\u5b66\u751f\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u51b3\u7b56\u7ed3\u6784\u66f4\u63a5\u8fd1\u539f\u59cb\u6559\u5e08\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Traditional forecasting methods, while theoretically interpretable, often require extensive manual tuning and are difficult to replicate in proprietary environments. Machine learning approaches offer predictive flexibility but introduce challenges related to interpretability, stochastic training procedures, and cross-environment reproducibility. This paper examines Prophet, an open-source forecasting framework developed by Meta, as a reproducibility-enabling solution that balances interpretability, standardized workflows, and accessibility. Rather than proposing a new algorithm, this study evaluates how Prophet's additive structure, open-source implementation, and standardized workflow contribute to transparent and replicable forecasting practice. Using publicly available financial and retail datasets, we compare Prophet's performance and interpretability with multiple ARIMA specifications (auto-selected, manually specified, and seasonal variants) and Random Forest under a controlled and fully documented experimental design. This multi-model comparison provides a robust assessment of Prophet's relative performance and reproducibility advantages. Through concrete Python examples, we demonstrate how Prophet facilitates efficient forecasting workflows and integration with analytical pipelines. The study positions Prophet within the broader context of reproducible research. It highlights Prophet's role as a methodological building block that supports verification, auditability, and methodological rigor. This work provides researchers and practitioners with a practical reference framework for reproducible forecasting in Python-based research workflows.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86Meta\u5f00\u53d1\u7684Prophet\u9884\u6d4b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u5176\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5e73\u8861\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3001\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7a0b\u548c\u53ef\u8bbf\u95ee\u6027\u7684\u53ef\u91cd\u590d\u6027\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5e76\u4e0eARIMA\u548c\u968f\u673a\u68ee\u6797\u8fdb\u884c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u3002", "motivation": "\u9884\u6d4b\u7814\u7a76\u4e0e\u5b9e\u8df5\u4e2d\u7684\u53ef\u91cd\u590d\u6027\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u5546\u4e1a\u548c\u91d1\u878d\u5206\u6790\u9886\u57df\u3002\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u9700\u8981\u5927\u91cf\u624b\u52a8\u8c03\u53c2\u4e14\u96be\u4ee5\u5728\u4e13\u6709\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u590d\u5236\uff0c\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u867d\u7136\u7075\u6d3b\u4f46\u5b58\u5728\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u548c\u968f\u673a\u8bad\u7ec3\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u516c\u5f00\u53ef\u7528\u7684\u91d1\u878d\u548c\u96f6\u552e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5728\u53d7\u63a7\u4e14\u5b8c\u5168\u6587\u6863\u5316\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e2d\uff0c\u5c06Prophet\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u4e0e\u591a\u79cdARIMA\u89c4\u683c\uff08\u81ea\u52a8\u9009\u62e9\u3001\u624b\u52a8\u6307\u5b9a\u548c\u5b63\u8282\u6027\u53d8\u4f53\uff09\u4ee5\u53ca\u968f\u673a\u68ee\u6797\u8fdb\u884c\u591a\u6a21\u578b\u6bd4\u8f83\u3002", "result": "Prophet\u5728\u5e73\u8861\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3001\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7a0b\u548c\u53ef\u8bbf\u95ee\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5177\u4f53Python\u793a\u4f8b\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5176\u5982\u4f55\u4fc3\u8fdb\u9ad8\u6548\u9884\u6d4b\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7a0b\u548c\u5206\u6790\u7ba1\u9053\u96c6\u6210\u3002", "conclusion": "Prophet\u4f5c\u4e3a\u53ef\u91cd\u590d\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u6784\u5efa\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3001\u53ef\u5ba1\u8ba1\u6027\u548c\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e25\u8c28\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u57fa\u4e8ePython\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7a0b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u7684\u53ef\u91cd\u590d\u9884\u6d4b\u53c2\u8003\u6846\u67b6\u3002"}}

Most work in this area uses an algorithm design strategy that combines a bandit learning algorithm with the virtual queue technique to track the throughput constraint violation. These algorithms seek to minimize the virtual queue length in their algorithm design. However, in networks where channel conditions change abruptly, the resulting constraints may become infeasible, leading to unbounded growth in virtual queue lengths. In this paper, we make the key observation that the dynamics of the head-of-line age, i.e. the age of the oldest packet in the virtual queue, make it more robust when used in algorithm design compared to the virtual queue length. We therefore design a learning-based scheduling policy that uses the head-of-line age in place of the virtual queue length. We show that our policy matches state-of-the-art performance under i.i.d. network conditions. Crucially, we also show that the system remains stable even under abrupt changes in channel conditions and can rapidly recover from periods of constraint infeasibility.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4f7f\u7528\u961f\u9996\u5e74\u9f84\u4ee3\u66ff\u865a\u62df\u961f\u5217\u957f\u5ea6\u6765\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5b66\u4e60\u578b\u8c03\u5ea6\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5728\u4fe1\u9053\u6761\u4ef6\u7a81\u53d8\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u7cfb\u7edf\u7a33\u5b9a", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u57fa\u4e8e\u865a\u62df\u961f\u5217\u957f\u5ea6\u7684\u7ea6\u675f\u7ec4\u5408\u591a\u81c2\u8001\u864e\u673a\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u4fe1\u9053\u6761\u4ef6\u7a81\u53d8\u65f6\uff0c\u7ea6\u675f\u53ef\u80fd\u53d8\u5f97\u4e0d\u53ef\u884c\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u865a\u62df\u961f\u5217\u957f\u5ea6\u65e0\u9650\u589e\u957f\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u57fa\u4e8e\u5b66\u4e60\u578b\u8c03\u5ea6\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u961f\u9996\u5e74\u9f84\uff08\u865a\u62df\u961f\u5217\u4e2d\u6700\u65e7\u6570\u636e\u5305\u7684\u5e74\u9f84\uff09\u4ee3\u66ff\u865a\u62df\u961f\u5217\u957f\u5ea6\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u7b97\u6cd5\u9c81\u68d2\u6027", "result": "\u5728i.i.d.\u7f51\u7edc\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u5f53\uff1b\u5728\u4fe1\u9053\u6761\u4ef6\u7a81\u53d8\u65f6\u7cfb\u7edf\u4fdd\u6301\u7a33\u5b9a\uff0c\u5e76\u80fd\u5feb\u901f\u4ece\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0d\u53ef\u884c\u671f\u6062\u590d", "conclusion": "\u961f\u9996\u5e74\u9f84\u6bd4\u865a\u62df\u961f\u5217\u957f\u5ea6\u66f4\u9002\u5408\u7528\u4e8e\u7b97\u6cd5\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u80fd\u63d0\u9ad8\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u7f51\u7edc\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027"}}

Communities of Interest (CoIs) provide a promising paradigm for organising heterogeneous IoT sensor networks by grouping devices with similar operational and environmental characteristics. This work presents an anomaly detection framework based on the CoI paradigm by grouping sensors into communities using a fused similarity matrix that incorporates temporal correlations via Spearman coefficients, spatial proximity using Gaussian distance decay, and elevation similarities. For each community, representative stations based on the best silhouette are selected and three autoencoder architectures (BiLSTM, LSTM, and MLP) are trained using Bayesian hyperparameter optimization with expanding window cross-validation and tested on stations from the same cluster and the best representative stations of other clusters. The models are trained on normal temperature patterns of the data and anomalies are detected through reconstruction error analysis. Experimental results show a robust within-community performance across the evaluated configurations, while variations across communities are observed. Overall, the results support the applicability of community-based model sharing in reducing computational overhead and to analyse model generalisability across IoT sensor networks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u793e\u533a\u5174\u8da3(CoI)\u7684IoT\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u7f51\u7edc\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u878d\u5408\u65f6\u7a7a\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u5206\u7ec4\u4f20\u611f\u5668\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u68c0\u6d4b\u6e29\u5ea6\u5f02\u5e38", "motivation": "IoT\u8bbe\u5907\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u90e8\u7f72\u5f62\u6210\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u6709\u6548\u7ec4\u7ec7\u5f02\u6784\u8bbe\u5907\u5e76\u68c0\u6d4b\u5f02\u5e38\u3002\u793e\u533a\u5174\u8da3(CoI)\u8303\u5f0f\u4e3a\u7ec4\u7ec7\u5177\u6709\u76f8\u4f3c\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u524d\u666f\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f46\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u76f8\u5e94\u7684\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "1) \u4f7f\u7528\u878d\u5408\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u77e9\u9635\u5c06\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u5206\u7ec4\u4e3a\u793e\u533a\uff1a\u5305\u542bSpearman\u7cfb\u6570\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u3001\u9ad8\u65af\u8ddd\u79bb\u8870\u51cf\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u90bb\u8fd1\u6027\u3001\u6d77\u62d4\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\uff1b2) \u57fa\u4e8e\u6700\u4f73\u8f6e\u5ed3\u7cfb\u6570\u9009\u62e9\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u7ad9\u70b9\uff1b3) \u4f7f\u7528\u4e09\u79cd\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u67b6\u6784(BiLSTM\u3001LSTM\u3001MLP)\u8bad\u7ec3\u6b63\u5e38\u6e29\u5ea6\u6a21\u5f0f\uff1b4) \u91c7\u7528\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u4f18\u5316\u548c\u6269\u5c55\u7a97\u53e3\u4ea4\u53c9\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff1b5) \u901a\u8fc7\u91cd\u6784\u8bef\u5dee\u5206\u6790\u68c0\u6d4b\u5f02\u5e38\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff1a1) \u5728\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u914d\u7f6e\u4e2d\uff0c\u793e\u533a\u5185\u6027\u80fd\u7a33\u5065\uff1b2) \u4e0d\u540c\u793e\u533a\u95f4\u89c2\u5bdf\u5230\u6027\u80fd\u53d8\u5316\uff1b3) \u57fa\u4e8e\u793e\u533a\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u5171\u4eab\u5728\u51cf\u5c11\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u65b9\u9762\u5177\u6709\u9002\u7528\u6027\uff1b4) \u80fd\u591f\u5206\u6790\u6a21\u578b\u5728IoT\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u7f51\u7edc\u95f4\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u57fa\u4e8eCoI\u7684\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\u652f\u6301\u793e\u533a\u5185\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u793e\u533a\u95f4\u6a21\u578b\u5171\u4eab\u53ef\u51cf\u5c11\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\uff0c\u4e3a\u5206\u6790IoT\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u7f51\u7edc\u6a21\u578b\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

We introduce LookAroundNet, a transformer-based seizure detector that uses a wider temporal window of EEG data to model seizure activity. The seizure detector incorporates EEG signals before and after the segment of interest, reflecting how clinicians use surrounding context when interpreting EEG recordings. We evaluate the proposed method on multiple EEG datasets spanning diverse clinical environments, patient populations, and recording modalities, including routine clinical EEG and long-term ambulatory recordings, in order to study performance across varying data distributions. The evaluation includes publicly available datasets as well as a large proprietary collection of home EEG recordings, providing complementary views of controlled clinical data and unconstrained home-monitoring conditions. Our results show that LookAroundNet achieves strong performance across datasets, generalizes well to previously unseen recording conditions, and operates with computational costs compatible with real-world clinical deployment. The results indicate that extended temporal context, increased training data diversity, and model ensembling are key factors for improving performance. This work contributes to moving automatic seizure detection models toward clinically viable solutions.", "AI": {"tldr": "LookAroundNet\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8eTransformer\u7684\u766b\u75eb\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u66f4\u5bbd\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u7a97\u53e3\u6765\u5efa\u6a21\u766b\u75eb\u6d3b\u52a8\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u524d\u540eEEG\u4fe1\u53f7\u63d0\u9ad8\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u4e34\u5e8a\u548c\u5bb6\u5ead\u76d1\u6d4b\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\u3002", "motivation": "\u7531\u4e8e\u766b\u75eb\u52a8\u6001\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u60a3\u8005\u3001\u8bb0\u5f55\u6761\u4ef6\u548c\u4e34\u5e8a\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u5de8\u5927\u53d8\u5f02\u6027\uff0c\u81ea\u52a8\u766b\u75eb\u68c0\u6d4b\u4ecd\u7136\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\u3002\u4e34\u5e8a\u533b\u751f\u5728\u89e3\u8bfbEEG\u65f6\u901a\u5e38\u4f1a\u53c2\u8003\u5468\u56f4\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u800c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5f80\u5f80\u7f3a\u4e4f\u8fd9\u79cd\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faLookAroundNet\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8eTransformer\u7684\u766b\u75eb\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u66f4\u5bbd\u7684EEG\u6570\u636e\u65f6\u95f4\u7a97\u53e3\u6765\u5efa\u6a21\u766b\u75eb\u6d3b\u52a8\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u7ed3\u5408\u611f\u5174\u8da3\u6bb5\u524d\u540e\u7684EEG\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u6a21\u62df\u4e34\u5e8a\u533b\u751f\u4f7f\u7528\u5468\u56f4\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7684\u65b9\u5f0f\u3002\u5728\u591a\u4e2aEEG\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u5e38\u89c4\u4e34\u5e8aEEG\u548c\u957f\u671f\u52a8\u6001\u8bb0\u5f55\uff0c\u6db5\u76d6\u4e0d\u540c\u6570\u636e\u5206\u5e03\u3002", "result": "LookAroundNet\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5f88\u597d\u5730\u6cdb\u5316\u5230\u672a\u89c1\u8fc7\u7684\u8bb0\u5f55\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9002\u5408\u5b9e\u9645\u4e34\u5e8a\u90e8\u7f72\u3002\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u3001\u589e\u52a0\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u591a\u6837\u6027\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u96c6\u6210\u662f\u63d0\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5173\u952e\u56e0\u7d20\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fd9\u9879\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u6269\u5c55\u65f6\u95f4\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u548c\u591a\u6837\u5316\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u4e86\u81ea\u52a8\u766b\u75eb\u68c0\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u5411\u4e34\u5e8a\u53ef\u884c\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u4e3a\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u4e34\u5e8a\u548c\u5bb6\u5ead\u76d1\u6d4b\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u53ef\u9760\u766b\u75eb\u68c0\u6d4b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}
