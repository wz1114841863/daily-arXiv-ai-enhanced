Although modern ES systems achieve high accuracy using powerful neural models, their deployment typically relies on CPU or GPU infrastructures that are energy-intensive and poorly suited for real-time inference in resource-constrained environments. In this work, we explore the feasibility of implementing McDonald-style extractive summarization on a low-power CMOS coupled oscillator-based Ising machine (COBI) that supports integer-valued, all-to-all spin couplings. We first propose a hardware-aware Ising formulation that reduces the scale imbalance between local fields and coupling terms, thereby improving robustness to coefficient quantization: this method can be applied to any problem formulation that requires k of n variables to be chosen. We then develop a complete ES pipeline including (i) stochastic rounding and iterative refinement to compensate for precision loss, and (ii) a decomposition strategy that partitions a large ES problem into smaller Ising subproblems that can be efficiently solved on COBI and later combined. Experimental results on the CNN/DailyMail dataset show that our pipeline can produce high-quality summaries using only integer-coupled Ising hardware with limited precision. COBI achieves 3-4.5x runtime speedups compared to a brute-force method, which is comparable to software Tabu search, and two to three orders of magnitude reductions in energy, while maintaining competitive summary quality. These results highlight the potential of deploying CMOS Ising solvers for real-time, low-energy text summarization on edge devices."}

This paper presents SwiftKV Attention, a per-token pipelined, low-latency single-pass attention inference algorithm, where every (kt, vt) in the KV cache is processed exactly once in a uniform per-token pipeline without score materialization, blockwise softmax, or a second pass, thereby enabling fast execution on edge accelerators with a single hardware set and no resource-intensive parallelism. Furthermore, to address the limited support for multi-head LLM decoding in existing accelerators, we design the SwiftKV-MHA accelerator, which enables high precision attention and low precision GEMV on the same processor array, achieving fast and efficient multi-head parallel decoding. Experimental results show that, on the edge accelerator, the SwiftKV Attention algorithm achieves a 7.16* speedup over native attention and significantly outperforms other attention algorithms.

When server load exceeds capacity, traditional approaches either uniformly throttle all message types regardless of importance (damaging gameplay) or apply fixed heuristic rules that fail to adapt to dynamic workloads. This paper presents AFLL (Adaptive Feedback Loop Learning), a real-time load stabilization system that learns the causal relationship between outgoing server messages and subsequent incoming client requests. AFLL employs backpropagation to continuously adjust message type weights, enabling predictive throttling that blocks low-priority messages before overload occurs while guaranteeing critical message delivery. Through controlled experiments with 1,000 concurrent players, AFLL reduced average CPU time by 48.3% (13.2ms to 6.8ms), peak CPU time by 51.7% (54.0ms to 26.1ms), and thread contention by 64.4% (19.6% to 7.0%), while maintaining zero learning overhead through background computation and caching optimizations. The system achieved remarkable reproducibility (CV < 2% across all metrics) and identified a three-stage causal chain linking message blocking to load reduction. AFLL demonstrates that circular causality learning enables practical real-time adaptation for latency-critical systems."}

While prior work has extensively studied the performance of the basic scheme, there has been less published work on adapting this technique to many aspects of large-scale systems. Based on our experience in building and running planet-scale cloud applications, we extend the understanding of d-way balanced allocation along the following dimensions:\n  (i) Bursts: Events such as breaking news can produce bursts of requests that may temporarily exceed the servicing capacity of the system. Thus, we explore what happens during a burst and how long it takes for the system to recover from such bursts. (ii) Priorities: Production systems need to handle jobs with a mix of priorities (e.g., user facing requests may be high priority while other requests may be low priority). We extend d-way balanced allocation to handle multiple priorities. (iii) Noise: Production systems are often typically distributed and thus d-way balanced allocation must work with stale or incorrect information. Thus we explore the impact of noisy information and their interactions with bursts and priorities.\n  We explore the above using both extensive simulations and analytical arguments. Specifically we show, (i) using simulations, that d-way balanced allocation quickly recovers from bursts and can gracefully handle priorities and noise; and (ii) that analysis of the underlying generative models complements our simulations and provides insight into our simulation results."}

Existing approaches face trade-offs: affine transformations are smooth and analytically invertible but lack expressivity; monotonic splines offer local control but are only piecewise smooth and act on bounded domains; residual flows achieve smoothness but need numerical inversion. We introduce three families of analytic bijections -- cubic rational, sinh, and cubic polynomial -- that are globally smooth ($C^\\infty$), defined on all of $\\mathbb{R}$, and analytically invertible in closed form, combining the favorable properties of all prior approaches. These bijections serve as drop-in replacements in coupling flows, matching or exceeding spline performance. Beyond coupling layers, we develop radial flows: a novel architecture using direct parametrization that transforms the radial coordinate while preserving angular direction. Radial flows exhibit exceptional training stability, produce geometrically interpretable transformations, and on targets with radial structure can achieve comparable quality to coupling flows with $1000\\times$ fewer parameters. We provide comprehensive evaluation on 1D and 2D benchmarks, and demonstrate applicability to higher-dimensional physics problems through experiments on $φ^4$ lattice field theory, where our bijections outperform affine baselines and enable problem-specific designs that address mode collapse."}

However, GRW workloads are notoriously difficult to accelerate due to their strong data dependencies, irregular memory access patterns, and imbalanced execution behavior. While recent work explores FPGA-based accelerators for GRWs, existing solutions fall far short of hardware potential due to inefficient pipelining and static scheduling. This paper presents RidgeWalker, a high-performance GRW accelerator designed for datacenter FPGAs. The key insight behind RidgeWalker is that the Markov property of GRWs allows decomposition into stateless, fine-grained tasks that can be executed out-of-order without compromising correctness. Building on this, RidgeWalker introduces an asynchronous pipeline architecture with a feedback-driven scheduler grounded in queuing theory, enabling perfect pipelining and adaptive load balancing. We prototype RidgeWalker on datacenter FPGAs and evaluated it across a range of GRW algorithms and real-world graph datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that RidgeWalker achieves an average speedup of 7.0x over state-of-the-art FPGA solutions and 8.1x over GPU solutions, with peak speedups of up to 71.0x and 22.9x, respectively.

Even in small-scale applications, the number of possible fusion configurations is vast, making brute-force benchmarking in production both cost- and time-prohibitive.\n  In this paper, we present a system that can analyze every possible fusion setup of complex applications.

However, naive uniform transfer from multiple source tasks may result in negative transfer, highlighting the need to properly balance the contributions of heterogeneous sources. Moreover, existing transfer learning methods typically focus on optimizing either the source weights or the amount of transferred samples, while largely neglecting the joint consideration of the other. In this work, we propose a theoretical framework, Unified Optimization of Weights and Quantities (UOWQ), which formulates multi-source transfer learning as a parameter estimation problem grounded in an asymptotic analysis of a Kullback-Leibler divergence-based generalization error measure. The proposed framework jointly determines the optimal source weights and optimal transfer quantities for each source task. Firstly, we prove that using all available source samples is always optimal once the weights are properly adjusted, and we provide a theoretical explanation for this phenomenon. Moreover, to determine the optimal transfer weights, our analysis yields closed-form solutions in the single-source setting and develops a convex optimization-based numerical procedure for the multi-source case. Building on the theoretical results, we further propose practical algorithms for both multi-source transfer learning and multi-task learning settings. Extensive experiments on real-world benchmarks, including DomainNet and Office-Home, demonstrate that UOWQ consistently outperforms strong baselines. The results validate both the theoretical predictions and the practical effectiveness of our framework."}

Digital Compute-in-Memory (DCiM) using SRAM offers a scalable solution, but its vast design space makes manual design impractical, creating a need for automated compilers. A key opportunity lies in approximate computing, which leverages the error tolerance of AI applications for significant energy savings. However, existing DCiM compilers focus on exact arithmetic, failing to exploit this optimization. This paper introduces OpenACM, the first open-source, accuracy-aware compiler for SRAM-based approximate DCiM architectures. OpenACM bridges the gap between application error tolerance and hardware automation. Its key contribution is an integrated library of accuracy-configurable multipliers (exact, tunable approximate, and logarithmic), enabling designers to make fine-grained accuracy-energy trade-offs. The compiler automates the generation of the DCiM architecture, integrating a transistor-level customizable SRAM macro with variation-aware characterization into a complete, open-source physical design flow based on OpenROAD and the FreePDK45 library. This ensures full reproducibility and accessibility, removing dependencies on proprietary tools. Experimental results on representative convolutional neural networks (CNNs) demonstrate that OpenACM achieves energy savings of up to 64\\% with negligible loss in application accuracy.

Most approaches tag messages with causality information and buffer them at the receiver until they can be safely delivered. Except for specific approaches that exploit communication topology, therefore not generally applicable, they incur a metadata overhead which is prohibitive for a large number of processes. Much less used are the approaches that enforce causal order by buffering messages at the sender, until it is safe to release them to the network, as the classic algorithm has too many drawbacks. In this paper, first we discuss the limitations of sender-only buffering approaches and introduce the Sender Permission to Send (SPS) enforcement strategy, showing that SPS + FIFO implies Causal. We analyze a recent sender-buffering algorithm, Cykas, which follows SPS + FIFO, albeit very conservatively, pointing out throughput scalability and liveness issues. Then, we introduce a novel SPS + FIFO based algorithm, which adopts a new hybrid approach: enforcing causality by combining sender-buffering to enforce SPS and receiver-buffering to enforce FIFO. The algorithm overcomes limitations of sender-only buffering, and achieves effectively constant metadata size per message. By a careful choice of data-structures, the algorithm is also computationally-optimal, with amortized effectively constant processing overhead. As far as we know, there is no other topology-agnostic causal delivery algorithm with these properties."}

In this paper, we propose \"digital metabolism,\" a thermodynamic hypothesis suggesting that targeted forgetting is necessary for distilling a pure neural logic core. To validate this hypothesis, we introduce the Regenerative Logic-Core Protocol (RLCP), a dual-stream training framework that renders specific factual dependencies linearly undecodable via deep-layer gradient reversal. Applying RLCP to Qwen2.5-0.5B, we observe a distinct phase transition: the model achieves near-zero retention of targeted factual associations (Accuracy < 7%) while exhibiting changes consistent with an emergent \"structural crystallization\" effect. Empirical analysis on GSM8K reveals that the \"metabolized\" model spontaneously adopts chain-of-thought (CoT) scaffolding, which we interpret as compensating for the loss of direct associative recall (shifting from $O(1)$ recall to $O(N)$ reasoning).

While ConvLSTM2D is a commonly used baseline, its dense convolutional gating incurs high computational cost and its strictly local receptive fields limit the modeling of long-range spatial structure and disentangled climate dynamics. To address these limitations, we propose FAConvLSTM, a Factorized-Attention ConvLSTM layer designed as a drop-in replacement for ConvLSTM2D that simultaneously improves efficiency, spatial expressiveness, and physical interpretability. FAConvLSTM factorizes recurrent gate computations using lightweight [1 times 1] bottlenecks and shared depthwise spatial mixing, substantially reducing channel complexity while preserving recurrent dynamics. Multi-scale dilated depthwise branches and squeeze-and-excitation recalibration enable efficient modeling of interacting physical processes across spatial scales, while peephole connections enhance temporal precision. To capture teleconnection-scale dependencies without incurring global attention cost, FAConvLSTM incorporates a lightweight axial spatial attention mechanism applied sparsely in time. A dedicated subspace head further produces compact per timestep embeddings refined through temporal self-attention with fixed seasonal positional encoding. Experiments on multivariate spatiotemporal climate data shows superiority demonstrating that FAConvLSTM yields more stable, interpretable, and robust latent representations than standard ConvLSTM, while significantly reducing computational overhead."}

Submitted to WiOpt 2026", "summary": "Split learning (SL) enables collaborative training of large language models (LLMs) between resource-constrained edge devices and compute-rich servers by partitioning model computation across the network boundary. However, existing SL systems predominantly rely on first-order (FO) optimization, which requires clients to store intermediate quantities such as activations for backpropagation. This results in substantial memory overhead, largely negating benefits of model partitioning. In contrast, zeroth-order (ZO) optimization eliminates backpropagation and significantly reduces memory usage, but often suffers from slow convergence and degraded performance. In this work, we propose HOSL, a novel Hybrid-Order Split Learning framework that addresses this fundamental trade-off between memory efficiency and optimization effectiveness by strategically integrating ZO optimization on the client side with FO optimization on the server side. By employing memory-efficient ZO gradient estimation at the client, HOSL eliminates backpropagation and activation storage, reducing client memory consumption. Meanwhile, server-side FO optimization ensures fast convergence and competitive performance. Theoretically, we show that HOSL achieves a $\\mathcal{O}(\\sqrt{d_c/TQ})$ rate, which depends on client-side model dimension $d_c$ rather than the full model dimension $d$, demonstrating that convergence improves as more computation is offloaded to the server. Extensive experiments on OPT models (125M and 1.3B parameters) across 6 tasks demonstrate that HOSL reduces client GPU memory by up to 3.7$\\times$ compared to the FO method while achieving accuracy within 0.20%-4.23% of this baseline. Furthermore, HOSL outperforms the ZO baseline by up to 15.55%, validating the effectiveness of our hybrid strategy for memory-efficient training on edge devices."}

Accurate forecasting of RES generation is crucial for maintaining the reliability, stability, and economic efficiency of power system operations.

However, these methods may fail to fully capture the complex temporal dependencies and non-linear patterns within RES data. This paper introduces a multivariate Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)-based network designed to forecast RESs generation using their real-world historical data.

Numerical experiments reveal a transient exploratory phase in which SGD trajectories repeatedly escape sharp valleys and transition toward flatter regions of the loss landscape. By using a tractable physical model, we show that the SGD noise reshapes the landscape into an effective potential that favors flat solutions. Crucially, we uncover a transient freezing mechanism: as training proceeds, growing energy barriers suppress inter-valley transitions and ultimately trap the dynamics within a single basin. Increasing the SGD noise strength delays this freezing, which enhances convergence to flatter minima. Together, these results provide a unified physical framework linking learning dynamics, loss-landscape geometry, and generalization, and suggest principles for the design of more effective optimization algorithms."}

We propose a meta-guided gradient-free RL (MGF-RL) framework that learns a transferable initialization from historical outage experiences and rapidly adapts to unseen scenarios with minimal task-specific tuning. MGF-RL couples first-order meta-learning with evolutionary strategies, enabling scalable policy search without gradient computation while accommodating nonlinear, constrained distribution-system dynamics. Experiments on IEEE 13-bus and IEEE 123-bus test systems show that MGF-RL outperforms standard RL, MAML-based meta-RL, and model predictive control across reliability, restoration speed, and adaptation efficiency under renewable forecast errors. MGF-RL generalizes to unseen outages and renewable patterns while requiring substantially fewer fine-tuning episodes than conventional RL. We also provide sublinear regret bounds that relate adaptation efficiency to task similarity and environmental variation, supporting the empirical gains and motivating MGF-RL for real-time load restoration in renewable-rich distribution grids."}

We distinguish between quantities that change under such a scaling, including norms, distances, volume elements, and gradient magnitudes, and geometric objects that remain invariant, such as the Levi--Civita connection, geodesics, exponential and logarithmic maps, and parallel transport. We also discuss implications for Riemannian optimization, where constant metric scaling can often be interpreted as a global rescaling of step sizes rather than a modification of the underlying geometry.

The goal is to identify the important nodes and edges of an input graph that are crucial for performing a specific graph reasoning task. A number of studies have been conducted in this area, and various benchmark datasets have been proposed to facilitate evaluation. Among them, one of the most challenging is the Spurious-Motif benchmark, introduced at ICLR 2022. The datasets in this synthetic benchmark are deliberately designed to include spurious correlations, making it particularly difficult for models to distinguish truly relevant structures from misleading patterns. As a result, existing methods exhibit significantly worse performance on this benchmark compared to others.\n  In this paper, we focus on improving interpretability on the challenging Spurious-Motif datasets. We demonstrate that the self-reflection technique, commonly used in large language models to tackle complex tasks, can also be effectively adapted to enhance interpretability in datasets with strong spurious correlations. Specifically, we propose a self-reflection framework that can be integrated with existing interpretable graph learning methods. When such a method produces importance scores for each node and edge, our framework feeds these predictions back into the original method to perform a second round of evaluation. This iterative process mirrors how large language models employ self-reflective prompting to reassess their previous outputs. We further analyze the reasons behind this improvement from the perspective of graph representation learning, which motivates us to propose a fine-tuning training method based on this feedback mechanism."}

In this article, we propose an architecture-agnostic approach to TTA by adding an adapter network pre-processing the input images suitable to the classifier. This adapter is trained using the proposed quantile loss. Unlike existing approaches, we correct for the distribution shift by matching high-dimensional geometric quantiles.

However, existing methods still have limitations in capturing complex sequence dependencies and distinguishing confusing samples with high similarity. To address these challenges, we propose AVP-Pro, a novel two-stage predictive framework that integrates adaptive feature fusion and contrastive learning. To comprehensively capture the physicochemical properties and deep-seated patterns of peptide sequences, we constructed a panoramic feature space encompassing 10 distinct descriptors and designed a hierarchical fusion architecture. This architecture integrates self-attention and adaptive gating mechanisms to dynamically modulate the weights of local motifs extracted by CNNs and global dependencies captured by BiLSTMs based on sequence context. Targeting the blurred decision boundary caused by the high similarity between positive and negative sample sequences, we adopted an Online Hard Example Mining (OHEM)-driven contrastive learning strategy enhanced by BLOSUM62. This approach significantly sharpened the model's discriminative power. Model evaluation results show that in the first stage of general AVP identification, the model achieved an accuracy of 0.9531 and an MCC of 0.9064, outperforming existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods. In the second stage of functional subtype prediction, combined with a transfer learning strategy, the model realized accurate classification of 6 viral families and 8 specific viruses under small-sample conditions.

In the problem, there is a set of users and services, each associated with a set of descriptive features. Interactions between users and services produce feedback values, typically represented as numerical QoS metrics such as response time or availability. Given the observed feedback for a subset of user-service pairs, the goal is to predict the QoS values for the remaining pairs.\n  A key challenge in QoS prediction is the inherent sparsity of user-service interactions, as only a small subset of feedback values is typically observed. To address this, we propose a self-augmented strategy that leverages a model's own predictions for iterative refinement. In particular, we partially mask the predicted values and feed them back into the model to predict again. Building on this idea, we design a self-augmented mixture-of-experts model, where multiple expert networks iteratively and collaboratively estimate QoS values. We find that the iterative augmentation process naturally aligns with the MoE architecture by enabling inter-expert communication: in the second round, each expert receives the first-round predictions and refines its output accordingly.

This module enables the model to identify subtle cross-view conflicts for detecting online camouflaged fraudulent behaviors. Furthermore, inspired by the match-mismatch novelty detection mechanism of the CA1 region, we introduce a novelty-aware hypergraph learning module that measures feature deviations from neighborhood expectations and adaptively reweights messages, thereby enhancing sensitivity to online rare fraud patterns in the long-tailed settings.

To address this issue, we propose DP-SFT, a two-stage subspace fine-tuning method that substantially reduces noise magnitude while preserving formal DP guarantees. Our intuition is that, during fine-tuning, significant parameter updates lie within a low-dimensional, task-specific subspace, while other directions change minimally. Hence, we only inject DP noise into this subspace to protect privacy without perturbing irrelevant parameters. In phase one, we identify the subspace by analyzing principal gradient directions to capture task-specific update signals. In phase two, we project full gradients onto this subspace, add DP noise, and map the perturbed gradients back to the original parameter space for model updates, markedly lowering noise impact.

We propose a Federated Survival Learning framework with Bayesian Differential Privacy (FSL-BDP) that models time-to-default trajectories without centralizing sensitive data. The framework provides Bayesian (data-dependent) differential privacy (DP) guarantees while enabling institutions to jointly learn risk dynamics. Experiments on three real-world credit datasets (LendingClub, SBA, Bondora) show that federation fundamentally alters the relative effectiveness of privacy mechanisms. While classical DP performs better than Bayesian DP in centralized settings, the latter benefits substantially more from federation (+7.0\\% vs +1.4\\%), achieving near parity of non-private performance and outperforming classical DP in the majority of participating clients.

To mitigate these risks, this study compares two predictive maintenance strategies for helicopter engines: a supervised classification pipeline and an unsupervised anomaly detection approach based on autoencoders (AEs). The supervised method relies on labelled examples of both normal and faulty behaviour, while the unsupervised approach learns a model of normal operation using only healthy engine data, flagging deviations as potential faults. Both methods are evaluated on a real-world dataset comprising labelled snapshots of helicopter engine telemetry. While supervised models demonstrate strong performance when annotated failures are available, the AE achieves effective detection without requiring fault labels, making it particularly well suited for settings where failure data are scarce or incomplete. The comparison highlights the practical trade-offs between accuracy, data availability, and deployment feasibility, and underscores the potential of unsupervised learning as a viable solution for early fault detection in aerospace applications."}

Despite its foundational importance, efficient algorithms for computing resistance distances on large graphs are still lacking. Existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods, including power iteration-based algorithms and random walk-based local approaches, often struggle with slow convergence rates, particularly when the condition number of the graph Laplacian matrix, denoted by $κ$, is large. To tackle this challenge, we propose two novel and efficient algorithms inspired by the classic Lanczos method: Lanczos Iteration and Lanczos Push, both designed to reduce dependence on $κ$. Among them, Lanczos Iteration is a near-linear time global algorithm, whereas Lanczos Push is a local algorithm with a time complexity independent of the size of the graph. More specifically, we prove that the time complexity of Lanczos Iteration is $\\tilde{O}(\\sqrtκ m)$ ($m$ is the number of edges of the graph and $\\tilde{O}$ means the complexity omitting the $\\log$ terms) which achieves a speedup of $\\sqrtκ$ compared to previous power iteration-based global methods. For Lanczos Push, we demonstrate that its time complexity is $\\tilde{O}(κ^{2.75})$ under certain mild and frequently established assumptions, which represents a significant improvement of $κ^{0.25}$ over the SOTA random walk-based local algorithms. We validate our algorithms through extensive experiments on eight real-world datasets of varying sizes and statistical properties, demonstrating that Lanczos Iteration and Lanczos Push significantly outperform SOTA methods in terms of both efficiency and accuracy."}

Clustering requires a balance between abstraction and representation. To identify clusters, we need to abstract from superfluous details of individual objects. But we also need a rich representation that emphasizes the key features shared by groups of objects that distinguish them from other groups of objects.\n  Each clustering algorithm implements a different trade-off between abstraction and representation. Classical K-means implements a high level of abstraction - details are simply averaged out - combined with a very simple representation - all clusters are Gaussians in the original data space. We will see how approaches to subspace and deep clustering support high-dimensional and complex data by allowing richer representations. However, with increasing representational expressiveness comes the need to explicitly enforce abstraction in the objective function to ensure that the resulting method performs clustering and not just representation learning. We will see how current deep clustering methods define and enforce abstraction through centroid-based and density-based clustering losses. Balancing the conflicting goals of abstraction and representation is challenging. Ideas from subspace clustering help by learning one latent space for the information that is relevant to clustering and another latent space to capture all other information in the data.\n  The tutorial ends with an outlook on future research in clustering. Future methods will more adaptively balance abstraction and representation to improve performance, energy efficiency and interpretability. By automatically finding the sweet spot between abstraction and representation, the human brain is very good at clustering and other related tasks such as single-shot learning.

This setting, known as source-free universal domain adaptation (SF-UniDA), has recently gained attention, but all existing approaches only assume a single domain shift from source to target. In this work, we present the first study on continual SF-UniDA, where the model must adapt sequentially to a stream of multiple different unlabeled target domains.

To address this, we propose \\textbf{FAQ} (Family-Aware Quantization), a calibration data regeneration framework that leverages prior knowledge from LLMs of the same family to generate high-fidelity calibration samples.

Subsequently, this data, carrying Chain-of-Thought reasoning and conforming to the expected activation distribution, undergoes group competition under expert guidance to select the best samples, which are then re-normalized to enhance the effectiveness of standard PTQ.

Parameter-efficient methods such as LoRA are widely adopted to reduce communication and memory costs.

This makes direct aggregation of LoRA updates biased and unstable. Existing solutions typically enforce unified ranks or align heterogeneous updates into a shared subspace, which over-constrains client-specific semantics, limits personalization, and provides weak protection of local client information under differential privacy noise. To address this issue, we propose Selective Dual-module Federated LoRA (SDFLoRA), which decomposes each client adapter into a global module that captures transferable knowledge and a local module that preserves client-specific adaptations. The global module is selectively aligned and aggregated across clients, while local modules remain private. This design enables robust learning under rank heterogeneity and supports privacy-aware optimization by injecting differential privacy noise exclusively into the global module. Experiments on GLUE benchmarks demonstrate that SDFLoRA outperforms representative federated LoRA baselines and achieves a better utility-privacy trade-off."}

While Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) is commonly used to update model knowledge, it often updates factual content without reliably improving the model's ability to use the newly incorporated information for question answering or decision-making. Reinforcement Learning (RL) is essential for acquiring reasoning skills; however, its high computational cost makes it impractical for efficient online adaptation. We empirically observe that the parameter updates induced by SFT and RL are nearly orthogonal. Based on this observation, we propose Parametric Skill Transfer (PaST), a framework that supports modular skill transfer for efficient and effective knowledge adaptation. By extracting a domain-agnostic Skill Vector from a source domain, we can linearly inject knowledge manipulation skills into a target model after it has undergone lightweight SFT on new data. Experiments on knowledge-incorporation QA (SQuAD, LooGLE) and agentic tool-use benchmarks (ToolBench) demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. On SQuAD, PaST outperforms the state-of-the-art self-editing SFT baseline by up to 9.9 points.

Traditional tree-based methods often falter in these regimes due to their reliance on statistical purity metrics, which become unstable and prone to overfitting with limited supervision. At the same time, direct applications of large language models (LLMs) often overlook its inherent structure, leading to suboptimal performance. To overcome these limitations, we propose FORESTLLM, a novel framework that unifies the structural inductive biases of decision forests with the semantic reasoning capabilities of LLMs. Crucially, FORESTLLM leverages the LLM only during training, treating it as an offline model designer that encodes rich, contextual knowledge into a lightweight, interpretable forest model, eliminating the need for LLM inference at test time. Our method is two-fold. First, we introduce a semantic splitting criterion in which the LLM evaluates candidate partitions based on their coherence over both labeled and unlabeled data, enabling the induction of more robust and generalizable tree structures under few-shot supervision. Second, we propose a one-time in-context inference mechanism for leaf node stabilization, where the LLM distills the decision path and its supporting examples into a concise, deterministic prediction, replacing noisy empirical estimates with semantically informed outputs.

However, the potential of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), which shows great successes for enhancing large language models (LLMs), has not been well explored, due to the fundamental difference between LLM and DLM decoding. To fill this critical gap, we systematically test the performance of DLMs within the RAG framework. Our findings reveal that DLMs coupled with RAG show promising potentials with stronger dependency on contextual information, but suffer from limited generation precision. We identify a key underlying issue: Response Semantic Drift (RSD), where the generated answer progressively deviates from the query's original semantics, leading to low precision content. We trace this problem to the denoising strategies in DLMs, which fail to maintain semantic alignment with the query throughout the iterative denoising process. To address this, we propose Semantic-Preserving REtrieval-Augmented Diffusion (SPREAD), a novel framework that introduces a query-relevance-guided denoising strategy. By actively guiding the denoising trajectory, SPREAD ensures the generation remains anchored to the query's semantics and effectively suppresses drift. Experimental results demonstrate that SPREAD significantly enhances the precision and effectively mitigates RSD of generated answers within the RAG framework."}

Offline RL sidesteps the issues incurred by online RL training by leveraging a dataset of state transitions collected from arbitrary policies prior to training.\n  Our methodology applies offline RL to a gray-box approach to energy efficiency, combining online application-agnostic performance data (e.g., heartbeats) and hardware performance counters to ensure that the scientific objectives are met with limited performance degradation.

We introduce the Diffusion Value Function (DVF), a factored value function for GMDPs that assigns to each agent a value component by diffusing rewards over the influence graph with temporal discounting and spatial attenuation. We show that DVF is well-defined, admits a Bellman fixed point, and decomposes the global discounted value via an averaging property.

Additionally, rate coding was utilized for the first time in these LGNs and LUTNs, enhancing the performance of LGNs. Furthermore, it is the first time that LGNs and LUTNs have been benchmarked on the MIT-BIH arrhythmia dataset using the inter-patient paradigm. Using an Artix 7 FPGA, between 2000 and 2990 LUTs were needed, and between 5 to 7 mW (i.e. 50 pJ to 70 pJ per inference) was estimated for running these models. The performance in terms of both accuracy and $jκ$-index is significantly higher compared to previous LGN results. These positive results suggest that one can utilize LGNs and LUTNs for the detection of arrhythmias at extremely low power and high speeds in heart implants or wearable devices, even for patients not included in the training set."}

We propose GenDA, a generative data assimilation framework that reconstructs high-resolution wind fields on unstructured meshes from limited observations. The model employs a multiscale graph-based diffusion architecture trained on computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations and interprets classifier-free guidance as a learned posterior reconstruction mechanism: the unconditional branch learns a geometry-aware flow prior, while the sensor-conditioned branch injects observational constraints during sampling. This formulation enables obstacle-aware reconstruction and generalization across unseen geometries, wind directions, and mesh resolutions without retraining. We consider both sparse fixed sensors and trajectory-based observations using the same reconstruction procedure. When evaluated against supervised graph neural network (GNN) baselines and classical reduced-order data assimilation methods, GenDA reduces the relative root-mean-square error (RRMSE) by 25-57% and increases the structural similarity index (SSIM) by 23-33% across the tested meshes. Experiments are conducted on Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) simulations of a real urban neighbourhood in Bristol, United Kingdom, at a characteristic Reynolds number of $\\mathrm{Re}\\approx2\\times10^{7}$, featuring complex building geometry and irregular terrain. The proposed framework provides a scalable path toward generative, geometry-aware data assimilation for environmental monitoring in complex domains."}

Investigating Ensembles of Diffusion Models", "comment": "Accepted at TMLR. Code: https://github.com/rarazafin/score_diffusion_ensemble", "summary": "Diffusion models now generate high-quality, diverse samples, with an increasing focus on more powerful models. Although ensembling is a well-known way to improve supervised models, its application to unconditional score-based diffusion models remains largely unexplored. In this work we investigate whether it provides tangible benefits for generative modelling. We find that while ensembling the scores generally improves the score-matching loss and model likelihood, it fails to consistently enhance perceptual quality metrics such as FID on image datasets. We confirm this observation across a breadth of aggregation rules using Deep Ensembles, Monte Carlo Dropout, on CIFAR-10 and FFHQ. We attempt to explain this discrepancy by investigating possible explanations, such as the link between score estimation and image quality. We also look into tabular data through random forests, and find that one aggregation strategy outperforms the others. Finally, we provide theoretical insights into the summing of score models, which shed light not only on ensembling but also on several model composition techniques (e.g. guidance)."}

We propose \\textit{low-rank KV adaptation} (LRKV), a simple modification of multi-head attention that reduces KV cache memory by exploiting redundancy across attention heads while preserving full token-level resolution. Each layer uses a shared full-rank KV projection augmented with low-rank, head-specific residuals, yielding a continuous trade-off between complete sharing and fully independent attention.\n  LRKV is a drop-in replacement for standard multi-head attention and directly subsumes query-sharing approaches such as multi-query and grouped-query attention, while remaining distinct from latent-compression methods such as multi-latent attention (MLA). Across large-scale pretraining experiments, LRKV consistently achieves faster loss reduction, lower validation perplexity, and stronger downstream task performance than standard attention, MQA/GQA, and MLA. At the 2.5B scale, LRKV outperforms standard attention while using roughly half the KV cache, and reaches equivalent model quality with up to \\textbf{20-25\\% less training compute} when measured in cumulative FLOPs. To explain these gains, we analyze attention head structure in operator space and show that LRKV preserves nearly all functional head diversity relative to standard attention, whereas more aggressive KV-sharing mechanisms rely on compensatory query specialization. Together, these results establish LRKV as a practical and effective attention mechanism for scaling Transformer pretraining under memory- and compute-constrained regimes."}

Although modern ES systems achieve high accuracy using powerful neural models, their deployment typically relies on CPU or GPU infrastructures that are energy-intensive and poorly suited for real-time inference in resource-constrained environments. In this work, we explore the feasibility of implementing McDonald-style extractive summarization on a low-power CMOS coupled oscillator-based Ising machine (COBI) that supports integer-valued, all-to-all spin couplings. We first propose a hardware-aware Ising formulation that reduces the scale imbalance between local fields and coupling terms, thereby improving robustness to coefficient quantization: this method can be applied to any problem formulation that requires k of n variables to be chosen. We then develop a complete ES pipeline including (i) stochastic rounding and iterative refinement to compensate for precision loss, and (ii) a decomposition strategy that partitions a large ES problem into smaller Ising subproblems that can be efficiently solved on COBI and later combined. Experimental results on the CNN/DailyMail dataset show that our pipeline can produce high-quality summaries using only integer-coupled Ising hardware with limited precision. COBI achieves 3-4.5x runtime speedups compared to a brute-force method, which is comparable to software Tabu search, and two to three orders of magnitude reductions in energy, while maintaining competitive summary quality. These results highlight the potential of deploying CMOS Ising solvers for real-time, low-energy text summarization on edge devices."}

Conventional machine learning (ML) models are effective in several domains, yet they struggle to represent the complexities observed in smart grid systems. Furthermore, traditional ML models are highly susceptible to adversarial manipulations, making them increasingly unreliable for real-world deployment. Quantum ML (QML) provides a unique advantage, utilizing quantum-enhanced feature representations to model the intricacies of the high-dimensional nature of smart grid systems while demonstrating greater resilience to adversarial manipulation. In this work, we propose QUPID, a partitioned quantum neural network (PQNN) that outperforms traditional state-of-the-art ML models in anomaly detection. We extend our model to R-QUPID that even maintains its performance when including differential privacy (DP) for enhanced robustness. Moreover, our partitioning framework addresses a significant scalability problem in QML by efficiently distributing computational workloads, making quantum-enhanced anomaly detection practical in large-scale smart grid environments. Our experimental results across various scenarios exemplifies the efficacy of QUPID and R-QUPID to significantly improve anomaly detection capabilities and robustness compared to traditional ML approaches."}

Current datasets differ substantially in structure and are time-consuming to access and process, which impedes data integration and reduces the comparability and generalizability of algorithmic developments. This work aims to establish a unified and accessible data resource for T1D algorithm development. Multiple publicly available T1D datasets were consolidated into a unified resource, termed the MetaboNet dataset. Inclusion required the availability of both continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) data and corresponding insulin pump dosing records. Additionally, auxiliary information such as reported carbohydrate intake and physical activity was retained when present. The MetaboNet dataset comprises 3135 subjects and 1228 patient-years of overlapping CGM and insulin data, making it substantially larger than existing standalone benchmark datasets. The resource is distributed as a fully public subset available for immediate download at https://metabo-net.org/ , and with a Data Use Agreement (DUA)-restricted subset accessible through their respective application processes. For the datasets in the latter subset, processing pipelines are provided to automatically convert the data into the standardized MetaboNet format. A consolidated public dataset for T1D research is presented, and the access pathways for both its unrestricted and DUA-governed components are described. The resulting dataset covers a broad range of glycemic profiles and demographics and thus can yield more generalizable algorithmic performance than individual datasets."}

We thus need stronger mitigations against bad actors misusing increasingly powerful systems. Prior work has shown that activation probes may be a promising misuse mitigation technique, but we identify a key remaining challenge: probes fail to generalize under important production distribution shifts. In particular, we find that the shift from short-context to long-context inputs is difficult for existing probe architectures. We propose several new probe architecture that handle this long-context distribution shift.\n  We evaluate these probes in the cyber-offensive domain, testing their robustness against various production-relevant shifts, including multi-turn conversations, static jailbreaks, and adaptive red teaming. Our results demonstrate that while multimax addresses context length, a combination of architecture choice and training on diverse distributions is required for broad generalization. Additionally, we show that pairing probes with prompted classifiers achieves optimal accuracy at a low cost due to the computational efficiency of probes.\n  These findings have informed the successful deployment of misuse mitigation probes in user-facing instances of Gemini, Google's frontier language model. Finally, we find early positive results using AlphaEvolve to automate improvements in both probe architecture search and adaptive red teaming, showing that automating some AI safety research is already possible."}
