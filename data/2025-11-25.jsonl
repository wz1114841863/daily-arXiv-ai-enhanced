While specialized parameter tuners exist, they are tied to a particular domain or use case, fixed in type and number of optimization goals, or focused on a specific layer or technology. These limitations pose significant adoption hurdles for specialized and innovative ventures (SIVs) that address a variety of domains and use cases, operate under strict cost-performance constraints requiring tradeoffs, and rely on self-hosted servers with custom technology stacks while having little data or expertise to set up and operate specialized tuners. In this paper, we present Groot - a general-purpose configuration tuner designed to a) be explicitly agnostic of a particular domain or use case, b) balance multiple potentially competing optimization goals, c) support different custom technology setups, and d) make minimal assumptions about parameter types, ranges, or suitable values. Our evaluation on both real-world use cases and benchmarks shows that Groot reliably improves performance and reduces resource consumption in scenarios representative for SIVs."}

This work introduces a training paradigm that enables large SNN architectures to be optimized without labeled data. We formulate a dual-path neuron in which a spike-generating process is paired with a differentiable surrogate branch, allowing gradients to propagate across augmented inputs while preserving a fully spiking implementation at inference.

The Memory Tagging Extension (MTE) to the ARM AArch64 Instruction Set Architecture is a valuable tool to address memory-safety escapes; when used in synchronous tag-checking mode, MTE provides deterministic detection and prevention of sequential buffer overflow attacks, and probabilistic detection and prevention of exploits resulting from temporal use-after-free pointer programming bugs.

There are many ways to quantify discourse, one common way being to evaluate the informativeness of the discourse. That is, given the total number of words produced, how many of those are context-relevant and accurate. This type of analysis is called Correct Information Unit (CIU) analysis and is one of the most prevalent discourse analyses used by speech-language pathologists (SLPs). Despite this, CIU analysis in the clinic remains limited due to the manual labor needed by SLPs to code and analyze collected speech. Recent advances in machine learning (ML) seek to augment such labor by automating modeling of propositional, macrostructural, pragmatic, and multimodal dimensions of discourse. To that end, this study evaluated five ML models for reliable identification of Correct Information Units (CIUs, Nicholas & Brookshire, 1993), during a picture description task. The five supervised ML models were trained using randomly selected human-coded transcripts and accompanying words and CIUs from persons with aphasia. The baseline model training produced a high accuracy across transcripts for word vs non-word, with all models achieving near perfect performance (0.995) with high AUC range (0.914 min, 0.995 max). In contrast, CIU vs non-CIU showed a greater variability, with the k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) model the highest accuracy (0.824) and second highest AUC (0.787). These findings indicate that while the supervised ML models can distinguish word from not word, identifying CIUs is challenging."}

We present Neuron Chunking, an I/O-efficient sparsification strategy that operates on chunks (i.e., groups of contiguous neurons in memory) and couples neuron importance with storage access cost. The method models I/O latency through a lightweight abstraction of access contiguity and selects chunks with high utility, defined as neuron importance normalized by estimated latency.

This study presents a proof-of-concept smart modular headband incorporating adjustable, replaceable embroidered electrodes for EEG acquisition. Compared with conventional devices, the smart headband reduces wiring complexity, removes the need for skin preparation, and minimizes irritation associated with gel-based electrodes. Its modular structure allows adjustable fitting without requiring multiple size options, enhancing comfort and adaptability for everyday EEG monitoring. The smart headband prototype was tested on 10 healthy university students using three behavioral tasks: (1) eyes open/closed, (2) auditory oddball, and (3) visual oddball paradigms. The smart headband successfully captured alpha peaks during the eyes-open/closed task (p = 0.01) and reliably recorded the event-related potentials associated with the oddball effects - the auditory P300 (p = 0.014) and the visual N170 (p = 0.013) - demonstrating an equivalent performance to a commercial sponge-based EEG cap. A user survey indicated improved comfort and usability, with participants reporting that the soft, structurally designed headband enhanced wearability relative to a conventional cap.

However, existing studies focus primarily on its algorithmic advantages such as accuracy and compression ratio-while overlooking the hardware deployment efficiency. Such hardware-unaware designs often obscure the potential latency and energy benefits of tensorized models. Although several works attempt to reduce computational cost by optimizing the contraction sequence based on the number of multiply-accumulate operations, they typically neglect the underlying hardware characteristics, resulting in suboptimal real-world performance. We observe that the contraction path, hardware architecture, and dataflow mapping are tightly coupled and must be optimized jointly within a unified design space to maximize deployment efficiency on real devices. To this end, we propose a co-exploration framework that unifies these dimensions within a unified design space for efficient training and inference of tensorized neural networks on edge platforms. The framework formulates a latency oriented search objective and solves it via a global latency-driven exploration across the unified design space to achieve end-to-end model efficiency. The optimized configurations are implemented on a configurable FPGA kernel, achieving up to 4 and 3.85 lower inference and training latency compared with the dense baseline."}

After preprocessing with padding, temporal rescaling, and flux normalization, a bidirectional LSTM network with masking layers was trained and evaluated on a test set of 19,920 objects.

Situations such as job start-ups, checkpoint storms, or heavily skewed namespace access can trigger thousands of concurrent metadata requests against a small subset of servers. The result is long queues, inflated tail latencies, and reduced system throughput. Prior efforts including static namespace partitioning, backend-specific extensions, and kernel-level modifications address parts of the problem, but they often prove too rigid, intrusive to deploy, or unstable under shifting workloads. We present MIDAS, an adaptive middleware layer that operates transparently between clients and metadata servers, requiring no changes to kernels or storage backends. The design brings together three mechanisms: (i) a namespace-aware load balancer that enhances consistent hashing with power-of-d sampling informed by live telemetry, (ii) a cooperative caching layer that preserves backend semantics through leases, invalidations, or adaptive timeouts, and (iii) a self-stabilizing control loop that dynamically adjusts routing aggressiveness and cache lifetimes while avoiding oscillations under bursty workloads. Analysis of the model and controlled experiments show that MIDAS reduces average queue lengths by roughly 23% and mitigates worst-case hotspots by up to 80% when compared to round-robin scheduling. These findings highlight that a stability-aware, middleware-based strategy can provide backend-agnostic improvements to metadata management, enabling better scalability in bursty scenarios, more predictable tail latencies, and stronger overall system performance."}

However, this simplistic integration neglects the causal dependencies between tasks, thereby impeding inter-task collaboration and information transfer. Second, these existing methods primarily focus on point-to-point relationships between instances, overlooking the group nature of inter-instance influences induced by deployment configurations and load balancing.

The increasing capability of consumer devices to capture footage in Ultra High-Definition (UHD) at 4K and 8K resolutions necessitates high-performance video transcoders for internet-based delivery. To address this demand, NVIDIA introduced Split-Frame Encoding (SFE), a technique that leverages multiple on-die NVENC chips available in high-end GPUs. SFE splits a single UHD frame for parallel encoding across these physical encoders and subsequently stitches the results, which significantly improves encoding throughput. However, this approach is known to incur an RD performance penalty. The widespread adoption of NVIDIA GPUs in data centers, driven by the rise of Generative AI, means NVENC is poised to play a critical role in transcoding UHD video. To better understand the performance-efficiency tradeoff of SFE, this paper evaluates SFE's impact on RD performance, encoding throughput, power consumption, and end-to-end latency using standardized test sequences. The results show that for real-time applications, SFE nearly doubles encoding throughput with a negligible RD performance penalty, which enables the use of higher-quality presets for 4K and makes real-time 8K encoding feasible, effectively offsetting the minor RD penalty. Moreover, SFE adds no latency at 4K and can reduce it at 8K, positioning it as a key enabler for high-throughput, real-time UHD transcoding."}

The results are then compared against both the normal-latency tuning of hardware encoders and leading software encoders. Results show hardware encoders achieve significantly lower E2E latency than software solutions with slightly better RD performance. While standard Low-Latency tuning yields a poor quality-latency trade-off, the Ultra Low-Latency mode reduces E2E latency to 83 ms (5 frames) without additional RD impact. Furthermore, hardware encoder latency is largely insensitive to quality presets, enabling high-quality, low-latency streams without compromise."}

Hence, the name comes \\emph{monotone decontamination}. This problem has been relatively explored in static graphs, but nothing is known yet in dynamic graphs. We, in this paper, study the \\emph{monotone decontamination} problem in arbitrary dynamic graphs. We designed two models of dynamicity, based on the time within which a disappeared edge must reappear. In each of these two models, we proposed lower bounds as well as upper bounds on the number of agents, required to fully decontaminate the underlying dynamic graph, monotonically. Our results also highlight the difficulties faced due to the sudden disappearance or reappearance of edges.

To mitigate performance degradation, knowledge distillation transfers information from the original model to the pruned student, enabling the smaller model to preserve reasoning ability. Experiments conducted on both Math23k and ASDiv-A verify the effectiveness of the proposed method. For example, on Math23k with a 30% pruning ratio, parameters are reduced by 18.7%, inference speed is improved by 27.5%, FLOPs are reduced by 19.3%, and accuracy drops only 0.7% (from 84.4% to 83.7%).

Cloud providers meet this demand through GPU-as-a-Service platforms that offer rentable GPU resources for running AI workloads. In this context, the sharing of GPU resources between different tenants is essential to maximize the number of scheduled workloads. Among the various GPU sharing technologies, NVIDIA's Multi-Instance GPU (MIG) stands out by partitioning GPUs at hardware level into isolated slices with dedicated compute and memory, ensuring strong tenant isolation, preventing resource contention, and enhancing security. Despite these advantages, MIG's fixed partitioning introduces scheduling rigidity, leading to severe GPU fragmentation in multi-tenant environments, where workloads are continuously deployed and terminated. Fragmentation leaves GPUs underutilized, limiting the number of workloads that can be accommodated. To overcome this challenge, we propose a novel scheduling framework for MIG-based clouds that maximizes workload acceptance while mitigating fragmentation in an online, workload-agnostic setting. We introduce a fragmentation metric to quantify resource inefficiency and guide allocation decisions. Building on this metric, our greedy scheduling algorithm selects GPUs and MIG slices that minimize fragmentation growth for each incoming workload. We evaluate our approach against multiple baseline strategies under diverse workload distributions. Results demonstrate that our method consistently achieves higher workload acceptance rates, leading to an average 10% increase in the number of scheduled workloads in heavy load conditions, while using approximately the same number of GPUs as the benchmark methods."}

This problem is especially challenging when multiple, potentially conflicting human values must be considered and balanced. Although several variants of existing alignment methods (such as Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO)) have been proposed to address multi-value alignment, they suffer from notable limitations: 1) they are often unstable and inefficient in multi-value optimization; and 2) they fail to effectively handle value conflicts. As a result, these approaches typically struggle to achieve optimal trade-offs when aligning multiple values.\n  To address this challenge, we propose a novel framework called Multi-Value Alignment (MVA). It mitigates alignment degradation caused by parameter interference among diverse human values by minimizing their mutual information. Furthermore, we propose a value extrapolation strategy to efficiently explore the Pareto frontier, thereby constructing a set of LLMs with diverse value preferences. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MVA consistently outperforms existing baselines in aligning LLMs with multiple human values."}

To meet both privacy and responsiveness demands, user data is embedded as vectors and stored in a vector database for fast similarity search. However, most existing vector databases target server-class environments. When ported directly to smartphones, two gaps emerge: (G1) a mismatch between mobile SoC constraints and vector-database assumptions, including tight bandwidth budgets, limited on-chip memory, and stricter data type and layout constraints; and (G2) a workload mismatch, because on-device usage resembles a continuously learning memory, in which queries must coexist with frequent inserts, deletions, and ongoing index maintenance. To address these challenges, we propose AME, an on-device Agentic Memory Engine co-designed with modern smartphone SoCs. AME introduces two key techniques: (1) a hardware-aware, high-efficiency matrix pipeline that maximizes compute-unit utilization and exploits multi-level on-chip storage to sustain high throughput; and (2) a hardware- and workload-aware scheduling scheme that coordinates querying, insertion, and index rebuilding to minimize latency. We implement AME on Snapdragon 8-series SoCs and evaluate it on HotpotQA. In our experiments, AME improves query throughput by up to 1.4x at matched recall, achieves up to 7x faster index construction, and delivers up to 6x higher insertion throughput under concurrent query workloads."}

To facilitate research in the field, we introduce the Cognition-aware Egocentric Navigation (CEN) dataset consisting 6 hours of real-world egocentric recordings capturing diverse navigation behaviors in real-world scenarios.

This work focuses on two fundamental problems: leader election and spanning tree construction. For each problem, we present a constant-size (per edge), local certification scheme, where the conditions available to each node can only refer to the graph induced by its one-hop neighborhood. In particular, we provide certification schemes for leader election in chordal and $K_4$-free dismantlable graphs and for spanning tree construction in dismantlable graphs, assuming a root is given. For chordal graphs, our leader election certification scheme additionally ensures an acyclic orientation, a property that is not generally verifiable using constant-size certificates in arbitrary graphs. To the best of our knowledge, these are the first local certification results tailored to these graph classes, potentially highlighting structural properties useful for verifying additional problems. Finally, we propose an algorithm that automatically transforms any certification scheme into a silent self-stabilizing algorithm (i.e., an algorithm that automatically recovers from faults) by adding only one extra state to the set of states of the certification scheme, assuming a Gouda fair scheduler.

However, existing PEFT approaches apply static, input-agnostic updates to all tokens, disregarding the varying importance and difficulty of different inputs. This uniform treatment can lead to overfitting on trivial content or under-adaptation on more informative regions, especially in autoregressive settings with distinct prefill and decoding dynamics. In this paper, we propose GateRA, a unified framework that introduces token-aware modulation to dynamically adjust the strength of PEFT updates. By incorporating adaptive gating into standard PEFT branches, GateRA enables selective, token-level adaptation, preserving pre-trained knowledge for well-modeled inputs while focusing capacity on challenging cases. Empirical visualizations reveal phase-sensitive behaviors, where GateRA automatically suppresses updates for redundant prefill tokens while emphasizing adaptation during decoding. To promote confident and efficient modulation, we further introduce an entropy-based regularization that encourages near-binary gating decisions. This regularization prevents diffuse update patterns and leads to interpretable, sparse adaptation without hard thresholding. Finally, we present a theoretical analysis showing that GateRA induces a soft gradient-masking effect over the PEFT path, enabling continuous and differentiable control over adaptation. Experiments on multiple commonsense reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that GateRA consistently outperforms or matches prior PEFT methods."}

We provide detailed performance profiles for different deployment scenarios and offer practical recommendations for system selection based on workload characteristics. Our findings indicate that the choice between these frameworks should be guided by specific use-case requirements: vLLM excels in high-throughput batch processing scenarios, while TGI is better suited for latency-sensitive interactive applications with moderate concurrency."}

PaSE first applies Prototype-guided Calibration Learning (PCL) to refine unimodal representations and align them through an Entropic Optimal Transport mechanism that ensures semantic consistency. To further stabilize optimization, we introduce a Dual-Phase Optimization strategy. A prototype-gated fusion module is first used to extract shared representations, followed by Shapley-based Gradient Modulation (SGM), which adaptively adjusts gradients according to the contribution of each modality.

The Sticker Response Selection (SRS) task aims to select the most contextually appropriate sticker based on the dialogue.

To address this issue, we propose Emotion and Intention Guided Multi-Modal Learning (EIGML). This framework is the first to jointly model emotion and intention, effectively reducing the bias caused by isolated modeling and significantly improving selection accuracy. Specifically, we introduce Dual-Level Contrastive Framework to perform both intra-modality and inter-modality alignment, ensuring consistent representation of emotional and intentional features within and across modalities. In addition, we design an Intention-Emotion Guided Multi-Modal Fusion module that integrates emotional and intentional information progressively through three components: Emotion-Guided Intention Knowledge Selection, Intention-Emotion Guided Attention Fusion, and Similarity-Adjusted Matching Mechanism. This design injects rich, effective information into the model and enables a deeper understanding of the dialogue, ultimately enhancing sticker selection performance. Experimental results on two public SRS datasets show that EIGML consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving higher accuracy and a better understanding of emotional and intentional features.

To address these limitations, we introduce CycleSL, a novel aggregation-free split learning framework that enhances scalability and performance and can be seamlessly integrated with existing methods. Inspired by alternating block coordinate descent, CycleSL treats server-side training as an independent higher-level machine learning task, resampling client-extracted features (smashed data) to mitigate heterogeneity and drift. It then performs cyclical updates, namely optimizing the server model first, followed by client updates using the updated server for gradient computation. We integrate CycleSL into previous algorithms and benchmark them on five publicly available datasets with non-iid data distribution and partial client attendance.

While existing evaluation practices typically focus on distributional similarity (e.g., the Kullback-Leibler divergence) or predictive performance (e.g., Train-on-Synthetic-Test-on-Real (TSTR) accuracy), these approaches fail to assess semantic fidelity, that is, whether models trained on synthetic data follow reasoning patterns consistent with those trained on real data. To address this gap, we introduce the SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) Distance, a novel explainability-aware metric that is defined as the cosine distance between the global SHAP attribution vectors derived from classifiers trained on real versus synthetic datasets. By analyzing datasets that span clinical health records with physiological features, enterprise invoice transactions with heterogeneous scales, and telecom churn logs with mixed categorical-numerical attributes, we demonstrate that the SHAP Distance reliably identifies semantic discrepancies that are overlooked by standard statistical and predictive measures. In particular, our results show that the SHAP Distance captures feature importance shifts and underrepresented tail effects that the Kullback-Leibler divergence and Train-on-Synthetic-Test-on-Real accuracy fail to detect.

To address these limitations, we introduce the Non-stationary and Varying-discounting MDP (NVMDP) framework, which naturally accommodates non-stationarity and allows discount rates to vary with time and transitions. Infinite-horizon, stationary MDPs emerge as special cases of NVMDPs for identifying an optimal policy, and finite-horizon MDPs are also subsumed within the NVMDP formulations. Moreover, NVMDPs provide a flexible mechanism to shape optimal policies, without altering the state space, action space, or the reward structure. We establish the theoretical foundations of NVMDPs, including assumptions, state- and action-value formulation and recursion, matrix representation, optimality conditions, and policy improvement under finite state and action spaces. Building on these results, we adapt dynamic programming and generalized Q-learning algorithms to NVMDPs, along with formal convergence proofs. For problems requiring function approximation, we extend the Policy Gradient Theorem and the policy improvement bound in Trust Region Policy Optimization (TRPO), offering proofs in both scalar and matrix forms. Empirical evaluations in a non-stationary gridworld environment demonstrate that NVMDP-based algorithms successfully recover optimal trajectories under multiple reward and discounting schemes, whereas original Q-learning fails. These results collectively show that NVMDPs provide a theoretically sound and practically effective framework for reinforcement learning, requiring only minor algorithmic modifications while enabling robust handling of non-stationarity and explicit optimal policy shaping."}

Most existing methods typically model the brain as a flat network, ignoring its modular structure, and their attention mechanisms treat all brain region connections equally, ignoring distance-related node connection patterns. However, brain information processing is a hierarchical process that involves local and long-range interactions between brain regions, interactions between regions and sub-functional modules, and interactions among functional modules themselves. This hierarchical interaction mechanism enables the brain to efficiently integrate local computations and global information flow, supporting the execution of complex cognitive functions. To address this issue, we propose BrainHGT, a hierarchical Graph Transformer that simulates the brain's natural information processing from local regions to global communities. Specifically, we design a novel long-short range attention encoder that utilizes parallel pathways to handle dense local interactions and sparse long-range connections, thereby effectively alleviating the over-globalizing issue. To further capture the brain's modular architecture, we designe a prior-guided clustering module that utilizes a cross-attention mechanism to group brain regions into functional communities and leverage neuroanatomical prior to guide the clustering process, thereby improving the biological plausibility and interpretability.

We created a binary 5-year cancer-death outcome and defined two sets of predictors: a clinical set (demographic, tumor, and treatment variables) and a genomic set (gene-expression $z$-scores). We trained several supervised classifiers, such as Random Forest and XGBoost, and used 5-fold cross-validated predicted probabilities as unbiased risk scores. These scores were converted to pseudo-observations on $(0,1)^2$ to fit Gaussian, Clayton, and Gumbel copulas. Clinical models showed good discrimination (AUC 0.783), while genomic models had moderate performance (AUC 0.681). The joint distribution was best captured by a Gaussian copula (bootstrap $p=0.997$), which suggests a symmetric, moderately strong positive relationship. When we grouped patients based on this relationship, Kaplan-Meier curves showed clear differences: patients who were high-risk in both clinical and genomic scores had much poorer survival than those high-risk in only one set.

Although graph neural networks that leverage neuroimaging data have shown promise in depression diagnosis, existing approaches are predominantly data-driven and operate largely as black-box models, lacking neurobiological interpretability. Here, we present NH-GCAT (Neurocircuitry-Inspired Hierarchical Graph Causal Attention Networks), a novel framework that bridges neuroscience domain knowledge with deep learning by explicitly and hierarchically modeling depression-specific mechanisms at different spatial scales. Our approach introduces three key technical contributions: (1) at the local brain regional level, we design a residual gated fusion module that integrates temporal blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) dynamics with functional connectivity patterns, specifically engineered to capture local depression-relevant low-frequency neural oscillations; (2) at the multi-regional circuit level, we propose a hierarchical circuit encoding scheme that aggregates regional node representations following established depression neurocircuitry organization, and (3) at the multi-circuit network level, we develop a variational latent causal attention mechanism that leverages a continuous probabilistic latent space to infer directed information flow among critical circuits, characterizing disease-altered whole-brain inter-circuit interactions. Rigorous leave-one-site-out cross-validation on the REST-meta-MDD dataset demonstrates NH-GCAT's state-of-the-art performance in depression classification, achieving a sample-size weighted-average accuracy of 73.3\\% and an AUROC of 76.4\\%, while simultaneously providing neurobiologically meaningful explanations."}

Deep learning forecasters have shown strong ability to capture complex temporal and contextual patterns, achieving substantial accuracy gains. However, at the scale of thousands or even hundreds of thousands of loads in large distribution feeders, a deployment dilemma emerges: training and maintaining one model per customer is computationally and storage intensive, while using a single global model ignores distributional shifts across customer types, locations, and phases. Prior work typically focuses on single-load forecasters, global models across multiple loads, or adaptive/personalized models for relatively small settings, and rarely addresses the combined challenges of heterogeneity and scalability in large feeders. We propose M2OE2-GL, a global-to-local extension of the M2OE2 probabilistic forecaster. We first pretrain a single global M2OE2 base model across all feeder loads, then apply lightweight fine-tuning to derive a compact family of group-specific forecasters. Evaluated on realistic utility data, M2OE2-GL yields substantial error reductions while remaining scalable to very large numbers of loads."}

Hypercausal refers to AI systems that leverage extended, deep, or nonlinear causal relationships (expanded causality) to reason, predict, and infer states beyond the capabilities of traditional causal models. Current machine learning and quantum-inspired systems struggle in non-stationary environments, where data distributions drift and models lack mechanisms for continuous adaptation, causal stability, and coherent state updating. QML-HCS addresses this limitation through a unified computational architecture that integrates quantum-inspired superposition principles, dynamic causal feedback, and deterministic-stochastic hybrid execution to enable adaptive behavior in changing environments.\n  The framework implements a hypercausal processing core capable of reversible transformations, multipath causal propagation, and evaluation of alternative states under drift. Its architecture incorporates continuous feedback to preserve causal consistency and adjust model behavior without requiring full retraining. QML-HCS provides a reproducible and extensible Python interface backed by efficient computational routines, enabling experimentation in quantum-inspired learning, causal reasoning, and hybrid computation without the need for specialized hardware.\n  A minimal simulation demonstrates how a hypercausal model adapts to a sudden shift in the input distribution while preserving internal coherence.

The cascaded architecture has emerged as the mainstream paradigm for deep learning-based precipitation nowcasting. This paradigm involves a deterministic model to predict macroscopic trends (or posterior mean), followed by a probabilistic model to generate local details (or local stochasticity). However, existing methods commonly overlook the conflation of the systematic distribution shift in deterministic predictions and the local stochasticity. As a result, the deterministic component's distribution shift contaminates the predictions of the probabilistic component, leading to inaccuracies in precipitation patterns and intensity, particularly over longer lead times. To address this issue, we introduce RectiCast, a two-stage framework that explicitly decouples the correction of mean-field shift from the generation of local stochasticity via a dual Flow Matching model. In the first stage, a deterministic model generates the posterior mean. In the second stage, we introduce a Rectifier to explicitly learn the distribution shift and produce a rectified mean. Subsequently, a Generator focuses on modeling the local stochasticity conditioned on the rectified mean. Experiments on SEVIR and MeteoNet demonstrate that RectiCast achieves significant performance improvements over existing state-of-the-art methods."}

This especially holds for approaches that adapt to users and their specific states (e.g., motivation, knowledge, wants) over time.

In this work, we explore whether large language models (LLMs) can be used out-of-the-box to generate samples of user interactions that provide useful information for training reinforcement learning models for digital behavior change settings. Using real user data from four large behavior change studies as comparison, we show that LLM-generated samples can be useful in the absence of real data. Comparisons to the samples provided by human raters further show that LLM-generated samples reach the performance of human raters. Additional analyses of different prompting strategies including shorter and longer prompt variants, chain-of-thought prompting, and few-shot prompting show that the relative effectiveness of different strategies depends on both the study and the LLM with also relatively large differences between prompt paraphrases alone.

To address these, we propose a novel Enhanced Federated Deep Multi-View Clustering framework: first align local semantics, hierarchical contrastive fusion within clients resolves view uncertainty by eliminating semantic conflicts; a view adaptive drift module mitigates aggregation uncertainty through global-local prototype contrast that dynamically corrects parameter deviations; and a balanced aggregation mechanism coordinates client updates.

A simple encoder network is proposed to project the weights of LLMs into discrete latent vectors, which are then represented using a compact codebook. A lightweight decoder network is employed to map the codebook's representative vectors back to the original weight space. This method allows for significant compression of the large weights in LLMs, consisting solely of a small decoder, a concise codebook, and an index.

Preprint. Work in progress", "summary": "Modern artificial intelligence systems depend heavily on large datasets for both training and transferring knowledge between models. Knowledge distillation, transfer learning, and dataset distillation have made such transfers more efficient, yet they remain fundamentally data-driven: a teacher must produce examples, logits, or gradients for a student to learn. In this work, we introduce Model-to-Model Knowledge Transmission (M2KT), a novel paradigm for data-free conceptual transfer between neural networks. M2KT enables models to exchange knowledge packets that encapsulate structured concept embeddings, abstraction graphs, reasoning traces, and provenance metadata. Unlike classical distillation, M2KT operates primarily in concept space rather than example space, and it does not require labeled datasets or teacher-generated outputs during transfer. We formalize the notion of concept manifolds, introduce an inter-model alignment mapping between teacher and student latent spaces, and derive a composite loss that enforces geometric, structural, and reasoning consistency together with explicit safety constraints. We further present algorithmic procedures for teacher-side packet generation and student-side ingestion and verification. Experiments on symbolic reasoning with large language models show that M2KT can achieve approximately 85 to 90 percent of teacher performance while reducing data usage by over 98 percent compared to standard knowledge distillation. This work establishes a theoretical and practical foundation for data-free AI-to-AI knowledge transfer and self-improving model ecosystems."}

But sustainable growth depends on acquired users' generating lifetime value (LTV) exceeding customer acquisition cost (CAC). In order to maximize LTV/CAC ratio, it is crucial to predict channel-level LTV in an early stage for further optimization of budget allocation. The LTV forecasting problem is significantly different from traditional time series forecasting problems, and there are three main challenges. Firstly, it is an unaligned multi-time series forecasting problem that each channel has a number of LTV series of different activation dates. Secondly, to predict in the early stage, it faces the imbalanced short-input long-output (SILO) challenge. Moreover, compared with the commonly used time series datasets, the real LTV series are volatile and non-stationary, with more frequent fluctuations and higher variance. In this work, we propose a novel framework called Trapezoidal Temporal Fusion (TTF) to address the above challenges. We introduce a trapezoidal multi-time series module to deal with data unalignment and SILO challenges, and output accurate predictions with a multi-tower structure called MT-FusionNet. The framework has been deployed to the online system for Douyin. Compared to the previously deployed online model, MAPEp decreased by 4.3%, and MAPEa decreased by 3.2%, where MAPEp denotes the point-wise MAPE of the LTV curve and MAPEa denotes the MAPE of the aggregated LTV."}

Both areas are typically evaluated with informal evidence and ad-hoc experiments, with few explicit guarantees about how far an extracted or edited model can drift from the original on relevant inputs. We introduce BlockCert, a framework for certified blockwise extraction of transformer mechanisms, and outline how a lightweight extension can support certified local edits. Given a pre-trained transformer and a prompt distribution, BlockCert extracts structured surrogate implementations for residual blocks together with machine-checkable certificates that bound approximation error, record coverage metrics, and hash the underlying artifacts. We formalize a simple Lipschitz-based composition theorem in Lean 4 that lifts these local guarantees to a global deviation bound. Empirically, we apply the framework to GPT-2 small, TinyLlama-1.1B-Chat, and Llama-3.2-3B. Across these models we obtain high per-block coverage and small residual errors on the evaluated prompts, and in the TinyLlama setting we show that a fully stitched model matches the baseline perplexity within approximately 6e-5 on stress prompts. Our results suggest that blockwise extraction with explicit certificates is feasible for real transformer language models and offers a practical bridge between mechanistic interpretability and formal reasoning about model behaviour."}

Specifically, we design a novel autoencoder that integrates Mamba+ and Transformer, to transfer parameterized CAD sequences into latent representations. The Mamba+ block incorporates a forget gate mechanism to effectively capture long-range dependencies. The non-autoregressive Transformer decoder reconstructs the latent representations. A diffusion model based on multi-scale Transformer is then trained on these latent embeddings to learn the distribution of long sequence commands. In addition, we also construct a dataset that consists of long parametric sequences, which is up to 256 commands for a single CAD model.

However, the literature still lacks a methodology that fully leverages these longitudinal big data to accurately predict feed intake accounting for environmental conditions. To fill this gap, we developed an AI-based framework to accurately predict feed intake of individual animals and pen-level aggregation. Data from 19 experiments (>16.5M samples; 2013-2024) conducted at Nancy M. Cummings Research Extension & Education Center (Carmen, ID) feedlot facility and environmental data from AgriMet Network weather stations were used to develop two novel environmental indices: InComfort-Index, based solely on meteorological variables, showed good predictive capability for thermal comfort but had limited ability to predict feed intake; EASI-Index, a hybrid index integrating environmental variables with feed intake behavior, performed well in predicting feed intake but was less effective for thermal comfort. Together with the environmental indices, machine learning models were trained and the best-performing machine learning model (XGBoost) accuracy was RMSE of 1.38 kg/day for animal-level and only 0.14 kg/(day-animal) at pen-level.

Existing agent-centric methods often rely on direct environmental sensing, limiting scalability and raising privacy concerns. This paper introduces CubeletWorld, a novel framework for representing and analyzing urban environments through a discretized 3D grid of spatial units called cubelets. This abstraction enables privacy-preserving modeling by embedding diverse data signals, such as infrastructure, movement, or environmental indicators, into localized cubelet states. CubeletWorld supports downstream tasks such as planning, navigation, and occupancy prediction without requiring agent-driven sensing. To evaluate this paradigm, we propose the CubeletWorld State Prediction task, which involves predicting the cubelet state using a realistic dataset containing various urban elements like streets and buildings through this discretized representation. We explore a range of modified core models suitable for our setting and analyze challenges posed by increasing spatial granularity, specifically the issue of sparsity in representation and scalability of baselines. In contrast to existing 3D occupancy prediction models, our cubelet-centric approach focuses on inferring state at the spatial unit level, enabling greater generalizability across regions and improved privacy compliance. Our results demonstrate that CubeletWorld offers a flexible and extensible framework for learning from complex urban data, and it opens up new possibilities for scalable simulation and decision support in domains such as socio-demographic modeling, environmental monitoring, and emergency response.

This process improves memory usage, scalable parallelization on modern hardware, and routing congestion by controlling net interactions within each batch. However, conventional batching methods typically depend on heuristics that are computationally expensive and can lead to suboptimal results (oversized batches with conflicting nets, excessive batch counts degrading parallelization, and longer batch generation times), ultimately limiting scalability and efficiency.

We evaluate the performance of the fine-tuned classical-quantum BERT and demonstrate its feasibility as well as its potential in advancing this research area. Our experimental results show that the proposed hybrid model achieves performance that is competitive with, and in some cases better than, the classical baselines on standard benchmark datasets. Furthermore, our approach demonstrates the adaptability of classical-quantum models for fine-tuning pre-trained models across diverse datasets. Overall, the hybrid model highlights the promise of quantum computing in achieving improved performance for text classification tasks."}

However, the PI capability constructed by the Continuous Attractor Neural Networks (CANNs) in most existing BIN studies exhibits significant computational redundancy, and its operational efficiency needs to be improved; otherwise, it will not be conducive to the practicality of BIN technology. To address this, this paper proposes an efficient PI approach using representation learning models to replicate CANN neurodynamic patterns. This method successfully replicates the neurodynamic patterns of CANN-modeled Head Direction Cells (HDCs) and Grid Cells (GCs) using lightweight Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs). These ANN-reconstructed HDC and GC models are then integrated to achieve brain-inspired PI for Dead Reckoning (DR). Benchmark tests in various environments, compared with the well-known NeuroSLAM system, demonstrate that this work not only accurately replicates the neurodynamic patterns of navigation cells but also matches NeuroSLAM in positioning accuracy. Moreover, efficiency improvements of approximately 17.5% on the general-purpose device and 40~50% on the edge device were observed, compared with NeuroSLAM. This work offers a novel implementation strategy to enhance the practicality of BIN technology and holds potential for further extension."}

Input transformation-based attacks are a subfield of adversarial attacks that enhance input diversity through input transformations to improve the transferability of adversarial examples. However, existing input transformation-based attacks tend to exhibit limited cross-model transferability. Previous studies have shown that high transferability is associated with diverse attention heatmaps and the preservation of global semantics in transformed inputs. Motivated by this observation, we propose Block Stretch and Shrink (BSS), a method that divides an image into blocks and applies stretch and shrink operations to these blocks, thereby diversifying attention heatmaps in transformed inputs while maintaining their global semantics. Empirical evaluations on a subset of ImageNet demonstrate that BSS outperforms existing input transformation-based attack methods in terms of transferability. Furthermore, we examine the impact of the number scale, defined as the number of transformed inputs, in input transformation-based attacks, and advocate evaluating these methods under a unified number scale to enable fair and comparable assessments."}

Each reverse denoising step, with its associated spring stiffness, can be interpreted as one step of a stochastic differential equation with an effective time step set jointly by the noise schedule and that stiffness. The learned score then plays the role of the drift, equivalently the gradient of a learned energy, yielding a precise correspondence between diffusion sampling and Langevin time evolution.\n  This equivalence recasts molecular dynamics (MD) in terms of diffusion models. Accuracy is no longer tied to a fixed, extremely small MD time step; instead, it is controlled by two scalable knobs: model capacity, which governs how well the drift is approximated, and the number of denoising steps, which sets the integrator resolution. In practice, this leads to a fully data-driven MD framework that learns forces from uncorrelated equilibrium snapshots, requires no hand-engineered force fields, uses no trajectory data for training, and still preserves the Boltzmann distribution associated with the learned energy.\n  We derive trajectory-level, information-theoretic error bounds that cleanly separate discretization error from score-model error, clarify how temperature enters through the effective spring, and show that the resulting sampler generates molecular trajectories with MD-like temporal correlations, even though the model is trained only on static configurations."}

This paper introduces a periodicity-enforced surrogate modeling approach that incorporates periodic layers, neural network components that guarantee exact periodicity without penalty terms or output modifications, into deep learning architectures for DLD device design. The proposed method employs three sub-networks to predict steady-state, non-dimensional velocity and pressure fields (u, v, p) rather than directly predicting critical diameters or particle trajectories, enabling complete flow field characterization and enhanced design flexibility. Periodic layers ensure exact matching of flow variables across unit cell boundaries through architectural enforcement rather than soft penalty-based approaches. Validation on 120 CFD-generated geometries demonstrates that the periodic layer implementation achieves 0.478% critical diameter error while maintaining perfect periodicity consistency, representing an 85.4% improvement over baseline methods. The approach enables efficient and accurate DLD device design with guaranteed boundary condition satisfaction for multi-unit device applications."}

We introduce a new smoothed agnostic learning framework for Boolean inputs, where perturbations are modeled via random bit flips.

Under strictly subexponential assumptions on the input distribution, we give an efficient algorithm for learning halfspaces in this model, with runtime and sample complexity approximately n raised to a poly(1/(sigma * epsilon)) factor. Previously, such algorithms were known only with strong structural assumptions for the discrete hypercube, for example, independent coordinates or symmetric distributions.

However, existing methods typically require centralized data, which makes them unsuitable for distributed and federated environments where each device/client holds its own local dataset. Additionally, federated methods often assume that clients have labeled data, which is unrealistic in cases where clients lack the expertise or resources to label task-specific data. To address these challenges, we propose a Semi-Supervised Federated Multi-Label Feature Selection method, called SSFMLFS, where clients hold only unlabeled data, while the server has limited labeled data. SSFMLFS adapts fuzzy information theory to a federated setting, where clients compute fuzzy similarity matrices and transmit them to the server, which then calculates feature redundancy and feature-label relevancy degrees. A feature graph is constructed by modeling features as vertices, assigning relevancy and redundancy degrees as vertex weights and edge weights, respectively. PageRank is then applied to rank the features by importance. Extensive experiments on five real-world datasets from various domains, including biology, images, music, and text, demonstrate that SSFMLFS outperforms other federated and centralized supervised and semi-supervised approaches in terms of three different evaluation metrics in non-IID data distribution setting."}

Post-training quantization (PTQ) has emerged as a promising approach to mitigate these challenges with minimal overhead. While existing PTQ methods can effectively quantize LLMs, they experience substantial accuracy loss at extremely low bit-widths, primarily due to high-impact parameters that significantly influence quantization performance. Several approaches address these issues by identifying and retaining the high-impact parameters in FP16 format. However, they apply fixed ratios of high-impact parameters across all layers, overlooking layer-wise sensitivity variations. In this paper, we propose a quadratic optimization framework that determines layer-specific ratios of high-impact parameters while considering inter-layer dependencies. We quantize high-impact parameters to moderate bit-widths, which often result in negligible performance degradation in quantized LLMs, while the remaining parameters can be quantized to extremely low bit-widths. Under the same resource-constrained budget, this allows for preserving more high-impact parameters than methods that keep selecting a few in FP16 format. Additionally, the proposed framework allows us to leverage an advanced quantization method that often requires extensive learnable parameters solely for high-impact parameters, while applying a computationally efficient method to the rest. Our approach achieves an effective balance between computational efficiency and model accuracy while maintaining high performance compared to state-of-the-art methods."}

However, the main obstacle to effective quantization lies in systematic outliers in activations and weights, which cause substantial LLM performance degradation, especially at low-bit settings. While existing transformation-based methods like affine and rotation transformations successfully mitigate outliers, they apply the homogeneous transformation setting, i.e., using the same transformation types across all layers, ignoring the heterogeneous distribution characteristics within LLMs. In this paper, we propose an adaptive transformation selection framework that systematically determines optimal transformations on a per-layer basis. To this end, we first formulate transformation selection as a differentiable optimization problem to achieve the accurate transformation type for each layer. However, searching for optimal layer-wise transformations for every model is computationally expensive. To this end, we establish the connection between weight distribution kurtosis and accurate transformation type. Specifically, we propose an outlier-guided layer selection method using robust $z$-score normalization that achieves comparable performance to differentiable search with significantly reduced overhead. Comprehensive experiments on LLaMA family models demonstrate that our adaptive approach consistently outperforms the widely-used fixed transformation settings. For example, our method achieves an improvement of up to 4.58 perplexity points and a 2.11% gain in average six-task zero-shot accuracy under aggressive W3A3K2V2 quantization settings for the LLaMA-3-8B model compared to the current best existing method, FlatQuant, demonstrating the necessity of heterogeneous transformation selection for optimal LLM quantization."}

While previous work has explored using expert-labeled counterfactual annotations to enhance dataset coverage, obtaining such annotations is expensive, limiting the scalability of prior approaches. We propose leveraging large language models (LLMs) to generate counterfactual annotations for OPE in medical domains. Our method uses domain knowledge to guide LLMs in predicting how key clinical features evolve under alternate treatments. These predicted features can then be transformed using known reward functions to create counterfactual annotations. We first evaluate the ability of several LLMs to predict clinical features across two patient subsets in MIMIC-IV, finding that state-of-the-art LLMs achieve comparable performance. Building on this capacity to predict clinical features, we generate LLM-based counterfactual annotations and incorporate them into an OPE estimator. Our empirical results analyze the benefits of counterfactual annotations under varying degrees of shift between the behavior and target policies. We find that in most cases, the LLM-based counterfactual annotations significantly improve OPE estimates up to a point. We provide an entropy-based metric to identify when additional annotations cease to be useful.

By now, there is a large body of work on this topic; however, while many algorithms can achieve optimal list size in terms of $α$, all known algorithms must incur error which decays, in some cases quite poorly, with $1 / α$. In this paper, we ask if this is inherent: is it possible to trade off list size with accuracy in list-decodable learning? More formally, given $ε> 0$, can we can output a slightly larger list in terms of $α$ and $ε$, but so that one element of this list has error at most $ε$ with the ground truth? We call this problem high-accuracy list-decodable learning. Our main result is that non-trivial high-accuracy guarantees, both information-theoretically and algorithmically, are possible for the canonical setting of list-decodable mean estimation of identity-covariance Gaussians.

However, existing LLM serving frameworks exhibit non-deterministic behavior: identical inputs can yield different outputs when system configurations (e.g., tensor parallel (TP) size, batch size) vary, even under greedy decoding. This arises from the non-associativity of floating-point arithmetic and inconsistent reduction orders across GPUs. While prior work has addressed batch-size-related nondeterminism through batch-invariant kernels, determinism across different TP sizes remains an open problem, particularly in RL settings, where the training engine typically uses Fully Sharded Data Parallel (i.e., TP = 1) while the rollout engine relies on multi-GPU TP to maximize the inference throughput, creating a natural mismatch between the two. This precision mismatch problem may lead to suboptimal performance or even collapse for RL training. We identify and analyze the root causes of TP-induced inconsistency and propose Tree-Based Invariant Kernels (TBIK), a set of TP-invariant matrix multiplication and reduction primitives that guarantee bit-wise identical results regardless of TP size. Our key insight is to align intra- and inter-GPU reduction orders through a unified hierarchical binary tree structure. We implement these kernels in Triton and integrate them into vLLM and FSDP. Experiments confirm zero probability divergence and bit-wise reproducibility for deterministic inference across different TP sizes.

To address these challenges, we propose a novel unified continual learning framework for indoor localization called MOELO that, for the first time, jointly addresses domain-incremental and class-incremental learning scenarios. MOELO enables a lightweight, robust, and adaptive localization solution that can be deployed on resource-limited mobile devices and is capable of continual learning in dynamic, heterogeneous real-world settings. This is made possible by a mixture-of-experts architecture, where experts are incrementally trained per region and selected through an equiangular tight frame based gating mechanism ensuring efficient routing, and low-latency inference, all within a compact model footprint.

However, accurate modeling of realistic grain boundary networks requires large simulation cells, which GNN has difficulty scaling up to. To alleviate the computational costs and memory footprint of GNN, we propose a hybrid architecture combining a convolutional neural network (CNN) based bijective autoencoder to compress the spatial dimensions, and a GNN that evolves the microstructure in the latent space of reduced spatial sizes. Our results demonstrate that the new design significantly reduces computational costs with using fewer message passing layer (from 12 down to 3) compared with GNN alone. The reduction in computational cost becomes more pronounced as the spatial size increases, indicating strong computational scalability. For the largest mesh evaluated (160^3), our method reduces memory usage and runtime in inference by 117x and 115x, respectively, compared with GNN-only baseline. More importantly, it shows higher accuracy and stronger spatiotemporal capability than the GNN-only baseline, especially in long-term testing. Such combination of scalability and accuracy is essential for simulating realistic material microstructures over extended time scales. The improvements can be attributed to the bijective autoencoder's ability to compress information losslessly from spatial domain into a high dimensional feature space, thereby producing more expressive latent features for the GNN to learn from, while also contributing its own spatiotemporal modeling capability. The training was optimized to learn from the stochastic Potts Monte Carlo method. Our findings provide a highly scalable approach for simulating grain growth."}

Reinforcement learning (RL) and supervised fine-tuning (SFT) are two primary approaches to this end, yet their underlying mechanisms and differences remain theoretically unclear. In this work, we examine these aspects specifically for learning $k$-sparse Boolean functions with a one-layer transformer and intermediate supervision that is akin to CoT. In particular, we consider $k$-sparse Boolean functions that can be recursively decomposed into fixed 2-sparse Boolean functions. We analyze the learning dynamics of fine-tuning the transformer via either RL or SFT with CoT to identify sufficient conditions for it to provably learn these functions. We verify that these conditions hold for three basic examples, including $k$-PARITY, $k$-AND, and $k$-OR, thus demonstrating the learnability of both approaches. Notably, we reveal that RL and SFT exhibit distinct learning behaviors: RL learns the whole CoT chain simultaneously, whereas SFT learns the CoT chain step-by-step. Overall, our findings provide theoretical insights into the underlying mechanisms of RL and SFT as well as how they differ in triggering the CoT capabilities of transformers."}

To align the uncertainty measured by CP, conformal training methods minimize the size of the prediction sets. A typical way is to use a surrogate indicator function, usually Sigmoid or Gaussian error function. However, these surrogate functions do not have a uniform error bound to the indicator function, leading to uncontrollable learning bounds. In this paper, we propose a simple cost-sensitive conformal training algorithm that does not rely on the indicator approximation mechanism. Specifically, we theoretically show that minimizing the expected size of prediction sets is upper bounded by the expected rank of true labels. To this end, we develop a rank weighting strategy that assigns the weight using the rank of true label on each data sample. Our analysis provably demonstrates the tightness between the proposed weighted objective and the expected size of conformal prediction sets. Extensive experiments verify the validity of our theoretical insights, and superior empirical performance over other conformal training in terms of predictive efficiency with 21.38% reduction for average prediction set size."}

This work extends that foundational theory to the diverse architectures of modern Large Language Models. We first demonstrate a precise, analytical solution for a Gemma-style transformer block, proving that the entire effect of a context can be perfectly mapped to rank-1 patches on its MLP weight matrices and a patch to the RMSNorm scale. We then generalize this result, providing a constructive proof and algorithm for multi-layer models. To unify these findings, we introduce a general framework centered on two core properties: input controllability and output controllability. We prove that a perfect implicit weight patch is possible for any MLP block where the inner function is input-controllable and the outer function is output-controllable. This provides a simpler and more powerful lens for understanding how transformer models transmute prompts into effective weights. This setup generalizes to a wide range of modern LLM architectures including gating, pre-/post-norm, mixture of experts and sequential/parallel transformer blocks."}

In contrast, live jamming is a collaborative interaction that requires real-time coordination and adaptation without access to the other player's future moves, while preserving diversity to sustain a creative flow. Reinforcement learning post-training enables effective adaptation through on-policy interaction, yet it often reduces output diversity by exploiting coherence-based rewards. This collapse, known as ``reward hacking'', affects many RL post-training pipelines, but is especially harmful in live jamming, where musical creativity relies on dynamic variation and mutual responsiveness. In this paper, we propose a novel adversarial training method on policy-generated trajectories to mitigate reward hacking in RL post-training for melody-to-chord accompaniment. A co-evolving discriminator separates policy trajectories from the data distribution, while the policy maximizes the discriminator output in addition to coherence rewards to prevent collapse to trivial outputs. We evaluate accompaniment quality and output diversity in simulation with both fixed test melodies and learned melody agents, and we conduct a user study with the model deployed in a real-time interactive system with expert musicians. Quantitative evaluation and user feedback demonstrate improved output diversity, harmonic coherence, adaptation speed and user agency. Our results demonstrate a simple yet effective method to mitigate reward hacking in RL post-training of generative sequence models."}

However, practical DFOS systems face three critical challenges: (1) signal patterns of the same activity vary drastically under different fiber deployment types (e.g., underground, wall-mounted), causing domain shift; (2) labeled data in new deployment scenarios is often scarce or entirely unavailable, limiting model adaptability; and (3) even within source domains, data scarcity makes it difficult to capture intra-class diversity for robust learning.\n  To address these challenges, we propose a novel meta-learning framework, DUPLE, for cross-deployment DFOS activity identification. First, a dual-domain multi-prototype learner fuses temporal and frequency domain features, enhancing the model's generalization ability under signal distribution shifts. Second, a Statistical Guided Network (SGN) infers domain importance and prototype sensitivity from raw statistical features, providing data-driven prior information for learning in unlabeled or unseen domains. Third, a query-aware prototype aggregation module adaptively selects and combines relevant prototypes, thereby improving classification performance even with limited data.\n  Extensive experiments on cross-deployment DFOS datasets demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms baseline approaches in domain generalization settings, enabling robust event recognition across diverse fiber configurations with minimal labeled data."}

The default strategy, sequential fine-tuning on each new phase, is architecture-agnostic but often suffers catastrophic forgetting when later phases correspond to different sub-populations or tasks. Replay with a finite buffer is a simple alternative, yet its behaviour across generative and predictive objectives is not well understood. We present a unified study of stateful replay for streaming autoencoding, time series forecasting, and classification. We view both sequential fine-tuning and replay as stochastic gradient methods for an ideal joint objective, and use a gradient alignment analysis to show when mixing current and historical samples should reduce forgetting. We then evaluate a single replay mechanism on six streaming scenarios built from Rotated MNIST, ElectricityLoadDiagrams 2011-2014, and Airlines delay data, using matched training budgets and three seeds. On heterogeneous multi task streams, replay reduces average forgetting by a factor of two to three, while on benign time based streams both methods perform similarly. These results position stateful replay as a strong and simple baseline for continual learning in streaming environments."}

The structural causal bandit framework provides a graphical characterization for identifying actions that are unable to maximize rewards by leveraging prior knowledge of the underlying causal structure.

In this paper, we investigate the structural causal bandit with transportability, where priors from the source environments are fused to enhance learning in the deployment setting. We demonstrate that it is possible to exploit invariances across environments to consistently improve learning. The resulting bandit algorithm achieves a sub-linear regret bound with an explicit dependence on informativeness of prior data, and it may outperform standard bandit approaches that rely solely on online learning."}

Task arithmetic has recently emerged as a promising solution, using simple arithmetic operations-addition and negation-based on task vectors which are the differences between fine-tuned and pre-trained model weights, to efficiently modify model behavior. However, the full potential of task arithmetic remains underexplored, primarily due to limited mechanisms for overcoming optimization stagnation. To address this challenge, we introduce the notion of difference vector, a generalized form of task vectors derived from the historical movements during optimization. Using difference vectors as directed perturbations, we propose the Difference Vector-based Anisotropic Scaling Iterative algorithm (DV-BASI) to enable a continuous optimization process for task arithmetic methods without relying on any additional modules or components. Notably, by leveraging escapability and directional advantages of difference vectors, the average performance on different tasks of the multi-task model merged by DV-BASI may even outperform models individually fine-tuned. Based on this observation, we extend the application of difference vectors to a feasible fine-tuning method for single-task models. On the practical side, DV-BASI allows expressive searching directions with few learnable parameters and forms a scalable framework. We also integrate DV-BASI with task arithmetic methods and advanced optimization techniques to achieve state-of-the-art performance on both supervised and unsupervised evaluation protocols."}

This paper presents the first theoretical framework to analyze private training through a feature learning perspective. Building on the multi-patch data structure from prior work, our analysis distinguishes between label-dependent feature signals and label-independent noise, a critical aspect overlooked by existing analyses in the DP community. Employing a two-layer CNN with polynomial ReLU activation, we theoretically characterize both feature signal learning and data noise memorization in private training via noisy gradient descent. Our findings reveal that (1) Effective private signal learning requires a higher signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) compared to non-private training, and (2) When data noise memorization occurs in non-private learning, it will also occur in private learning, leading to poor generalization despite small training loss. Our findings highlight the challenges of private learning and prove the benefit of feature enhancement to improve SNR.

This suggests that safety behaviors are not erased but shifted to less influential regions of the parameter space. Building on this insight, we propose a curvature-aware alignment restoration method that leverages influence functions and second-order optimization to selectively increase loss on harmful inputs while preserving task performance. By navigating the shared geometry between base and fine-tuned models, our method discourages unsafe outputs while preserving task-relevant performance, avoiding full reversion and enabling precise, low-impact updates. Extensive evaluations across multiple model families and adversarial settings show that our approach efficiently reduces harmful responses while maintaining or even improving utility and few-shot learning performance."}

Traditional methods, including linkage approaches, face three major limitations: (i) they always return a hierarchy, even if none exists, (ii) they are restricted to binary trees, even if the true hierarchy is non-binary, and (iii) they are highly sensitive to the choice of linkage function. In this paper, we address these issues by introducing the notion of a valid hierarchy and defining a partial order over the set of valid hierarchies. We prove the existence of a finest valid hierarchy, that is, the hierarchy that encodes the maximum information consistent with the similarity structure of the data set. In particular, the finest valid hierarchy is not constrained to binary structures and, when no hierarchical relationships exist, collapses to a star tree. We propose a simple two-step algorithm that first constructs a binary tree via a linkage method and then prunes it to enforce validity.

Class Imbalance (CI) remains a fundamental challenge in FL, where rare but critical classes are often severely underrepresented in individual client datasets. Although prior work has addressed CI during training through reliable aggregation and local class distribution alignment, these methods typically rely on access to labeled data or coordination among clients, and none address class unsupervised adaptation to dynamic domains or distribution shifts at inference time under federated CI constraints. Revealing the failure of state-of-the-art TTA in federated client adaptation in CI scenario, we propose pFedBBN,a personalized federated test-time adaptation framework that employs balanced batch normalization (BBN) during local client adaptation to mitigate prediction bias by treating all classes equally, while also enabling client collaboration guided by BBN similarity, ensuring that clients with similar balanced representations reinforce each other and that adaptation remains aligned with domain-specific characteristics. pFedBBN supports fully unsupervised local adaptation and introduces a class-aware model aggregation strategy that enables personalized inference without compromising privacy. It addresses both distribution shifts and class imbalance through balanced feature normalization and domain-aware collaboration, without requiring any labeled or raw data from clients. Extensive experiments across diverse baselines show that pFedBBN consistently enhances robustness and minority-class performance over state-of-the-art FL and TTA methods."}

Surrogate models offer a more efficient alternative, but their development is hindered by the cost of generating sufficient training data from numerical solvers. In this paper, we present a novel framework for active learning (AL) in PDE surrogate modeling that reduces this cost. Unlike the existing AL methods for PDEs that always acquire entire PDE trajectories, our approach strategically generates only the most important time steps with the numerical solver, while employing the surrogate model to approximate the remaining steps. This dramatically reduces the cost incurred by each trajectory and thus allows the active learning algorithm to try out a more diverse set of trajectories given the same budget. To accommodate this novel framework, we develop an acquisition function that estimates the utility of a set of time steps by approximating its resulting variance reduction. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on several benchmark PDEs, including the Burgers' equation, Korteweg-De Vries equation, Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation, the incompressible Navier-Stokes equation, and the compressible Navier-Stokes equation. Experiments show that our approach improves performance by large margins over the best existing method. Our method not only reduces average error but also the 99\\%, 95\\%, and 50\\% quantiles of error, which is rare for an AL algorithm. All in all, our approach offers a data-efficient solution to surrogate modeling for PDEs."}

To bridge this gap, we introduce Vulnerability-Aware Robust Multimodal Adversarial Training (VARMAT), a probe-in-training adversarial training method that improves multimodal robustness by identifying the vulnerability of each modality. To be specific, VARMAT first explicitly quantifies the vulnerability of each modality, grounded in a first-order approximation of the attack objective (Probe).

We present LocaGen, a novel spatial augmentation framework that significantly reduces fingerprinting overhead by generating high-quality synthetic data at completely unseen locations. LocaGen leverages a conditional diffusion model guided by a novel spatially aware optimization strategy to synthesize realistic fingerprints at unseen locations using only a subset of seen locations. To further improve our diffusion model performance, LocaGen augments seen location data based on domain-specific heuristics and strategically selects the seen and unseen locations using a novel density-based approach that ensures robust coverage.

High variance leads to noisier gradient estimates and unstable optimization, so even equally strong pretrained MDMs and ARMs that are competitive at initialization often diverge after task-specific training, with MDMs falling far behind. There has been no theoretical explanation or systematic solution. We derive the first decomposition of MDM training variance into three sources: (A) masking pattern noise, (B) masking rate noise, and (C) data noise, while ARMs are only affected by (C). This explains the fundamental training gap. Building on this foundation, we design six variance-reduction methods, including two core methods: (1) P-POTS, a Pareto-optimal t sampler that minimizes training variance by sampling harder t values more often with appropriately smaller update steps, and (2) MIRROR, which uses negatively correlated samples to reduce (A). Experiments show that compared to standard MDM training, our methods improve accuracy by 7-8% on complex reasoning tasks, while simultaneously reducing run-to-run variability to near ARM levels, substantially narrowing the gap with strong ARM baselines; in most settings, even the best baseline runs remain below the worst run of our method."}

Traditional approaches rely on models trained on data from a small number of engines, which can be insufficient in generalizing across an entire population of engines due to sensor biases and variations in input conditions. In real world applications, these models require tuning or calibration to maintain acceptable error tolerance when applied to other engines. This highlights the need for models that can adapt with minimal adjustments to accommodate engine-to-engine variability and sensor discrepancies. While previous studies have explored machine learning methods for predicting engine-out NOx, these approaches often fail to generalize reliably across different engines and operating environments. To address these issues, we propose a Bayesian calibration framework that combines Gaussian processes with approximate Bayesian computation to infer and correct sensor biases. Starting with a pre-trained model developed using nominal engine data, our method identifies engine specific sensor biases and recalibrates predictions accordingly. By incorporating these inferred biases, our approach generates posterior predictive distributions for engine-out NOx on unseen test data, achieving high accuracy without retraining the model. Our results demonstrate that this transferable modeling approach significantly improves the accuracy of predictions compared to conventional non-adaptive GP models, effectively addressing engine-to-engine variability and improving model generalizability."}

We introduce RB-DeepONet, a hybrid operator-learning framework that fuses reduced-basis (RB) numerical structure with the branch-trunk architecture of DeepONet. The trunk is fixed to a rigorously constructed RB space generated offline via Greedy selection, granting physical interpretability, stability, and certified error control. The branch network predicts only RB coefficients and is trained label-free using a projected variational residual that targets the RB-Galerkin solution. For problems with independently varying loads or boundary conditions, we develop boundary and source modal encodings that compress exogenous data into low-dimensional coordinates while preserving accuracy. Combined with affine or empirical interpolation decompositions, RB-DeepONet achieves a strict offline-online split: all heavy lifting occurs offline, and online evaluation scales only with the RB dimension rather than the full mesh. We provide convergence guarantees separating RB approximation error from statistical learning error, and numerical experiments show that RB-DeepONet attains accuracy competitive with intrusive RB-Galerkin, POD-DeepONet, and FEONet while using dramatically fewer trainable parameters and achieving significant speedups.

The challenge comes from uneven demand patterns and the resulting asymmetric flow of resources across the arcs, which create persistent imbalances at the network nodes. Resource substitution among multiple, potentially composite and interchangeable, resource types is a cost-effective way to mitigate these imbalances. This leads to the resource substitution problem, which aims at determining the minimum number of resource substitutions from an initial assignment to minimize the overall network imbalance. In decentralized settings, achieving globally coordinated solutions becomes even more difficult. When substitution entails costs, effective prescriptions must also incorporate fairness and account for the individual preferences of schedulers. This paper presents a generic framework that combines operations research (OR) and machine learning (ML) to enable fair resource substitution in large networks. The OR component models and solves the resource substitution problem under a fairness lens. The ML component leverages historical data to learn schedulers' preferences, guide intelligent exploration of the decision space, and enhance computational efficiency by dynamically selecting the top-$κ$ resources for each arc in the network. The framework produces a portfolio of high-quality solutions from which schedulers can select satisfactory trade-offs. The proposed framework is applied to the network of one of the largest package delivery companies in the world, which serves as the primary motivation for this research.

While alternating the LoRA matrices has been shown to stabilize aggregation in centralized FL, extending this mechanism to decentralized, peer-to-peer communication introduces new challenges due to phase-state mismatch and block-wise divergence across clients. We introduce ADF-LoRA, which synchronizes the update of only one low-rank matrix per round and mixes both matrices to maintain more consistent parameter states under decentralized propagation. This design preserves the cross-term suppression effect of alternating updates while improving stability in serverless topologies. We provide a convergence analysis under standard smoothness assumptions and evaluate ADF-LoRA on multiple GLUE tasks. Experiments show that ADF-LoRA achieves faster and smoother convergence and delivers the highest average accuracy across tasks, outperforming existing LoRA variants in decentralized FL by a consistent margin."}

To address this challenge, we introduce GROOT, an algorithm and system co-design framework that contains chip design domain knowledge and redesigned GPU kernels, to improve verification efficiency. More specifically, we create node features utilizing the circuit node types and the polarity of the connections between the input edges to nodes in And-Inverter Graphs (AIGs). We utilize a graph partitioning algorithm to divide the large graphs into smaller sub-graphs for fast GPU processing and develop a graph edge re-growth algorithm to recover verification accuracy. We carefully profile the EDA graph workloads and observe the uniqueness of their polarized distribution of high degree (HD) nodes and low degree (LD) nodes. We redesign two GPU kernels (HD-kernel and LD-kernel), to fit the EDA graph learning workload on a single GPU. We compare the results with state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods: GAMORA, a GNN-based approach, and the traditional ABC framework. Results show that GROOT achieves a significant reduction in memory footprint (59.38 %), with high accuracy (99.96%) for a very large CSA multiplier, i.e. 1,024 bits with a batch size of 16, which consists of 134,103,040 nodes and 268,140,544 edges.

We firstly analyze the core limitations in State Space Model, namely the lack of consideration for correlated temporal lag and channel permutation. Building upon the insight, we propose Lag Fusion Mamba and Permutation Scanning Mamba, which enhance the model's ability to discern significant patterns during the denoising process.

However, existing approaches rely on rigid routing strategies (typically activating a fixed number of experts per token) ignoring the inherent heterogeneity in semantic importance across modalities. This leads to suboptimal compute allocation, where redundant tokens consume as many resources as critical ones. To address this, we propose AnyExperts, a novel on-demand, budget-aware dynamic routing framework that allocates a variable total number of expert slots per token based on its semantic importance. Crucially, to prevent uncontrolled compute growth, the total slots per token are constrained within a fixed range, and each slot is filled by either a real expert or a virtual expert, with the virtual share capped at a small maximum (e.g., 20%). The model then adaptively balances the real-to-virtual ratio per token, assigning more real experts to semantically rich regions and relying more on virtual experts for redundant content. Evaluated across diverse tasks in visual understanding, audio understanding, and NLP understanding, AnyExperts improves performance under the same compute budget. Notably, on general image/video tasks, it achieves comparable accuracy with 40% fewer real expert activations; on text-dense tasks (OCR and NLP), it maintains performance while reducing real expert usage by 10%. These results demonstrate that fine-grained, importance-driven expert allocation significantly enhances both the efficiency and effectiveness of multimodal MoE models."}

These infections often go unnoticed until they become severe, making early detection through innovative smart home technologies crucial.

This paper presents a clinician-in-the-loop (CIL) smart home system that leverages ambient sensor data to extract meaningful behavioral markers, train robust predictive ML models, and calibrate them to enable uncertainty-aware decision support. The system incorporates a statistically valid uncertainty quantification method called Conformal-Calibrated Interval (CCI), which quantifies uncertainty and abstains from making predictions (\"I don't know\") when the ML model's confidence is low. Evaluated on real-world data from eight smart homes, our method outperforms baseline methods in recall and other classification metrics while maintaining the lowest abstention proportion and interval width. A survey of 42 nurses confirms that our system's outputs are valuable for guiding clinical decision-making, underscoring their practical utility in improving informed decisions and effectively managing UTIs and other condition flare-ups in older adults."}

ST quantifies the expression of tens of thousands of genes in a tissue section; however, heavy observational noise is often introduced during measurement. In prior studies, to ensure meaningful assessment, both training and evaluation have been restricted to only a small subset of highly variable genes, and genes outside this subset have also been excluded from the training process. However, since there are likely co-expression relationships between genes, low-expression genes may still contribute to the estimation of the evaluation target. In this paper, we propose $Auxiliary \\ Gene \\ Learning$ (AGL) that utilizes the benefit of the ignored genes by reformulating their expression estimation as auxiliary tasks and training them jointly with the primary tasks. To effectively leverage auxiliary genes, we must select a subset of auxiliary genes that positively influence the prediction of the target genes. However, this is a challenging optimization problem due to the vast number of possible combinations. To overcome this challenge, we propose Prior-Knowledge-Based Differentiable Top-$k$ Gene Selection via Bi-level Optimization (DkGSB), a method that ranks genes by leveraging prior knowledge and relaxes the combinatorial selection problem into a differentiable top-$k$ selection problem. The experiments confirm the effectiveness of incorporating auxiliary genes and show that the proposed method outperforms conventional auxiliary task learning approaches."}

To solve these challenges, we propose a Multi-View Conditional Information Bottleneck framework, called MVCIB, for pre-training graph neural networks on 2D and 3D molecular structures in a self-supervised setting. Our idea is to discover the shared information while minimizing irrelevant features from each view under the MVCIB principle, which uses one view as a contextual condition to guide the representation learning of its counterpart. To enhance semantic and structural consistency across views, we utilize key substructures, e.g., functional groups and ego-networks, as anchors between the two views. Then, we propose a cross-attention mechanism that captures fine-grained correlations between the substructures to achieve subgraph alignment across views. Extensive experiments in four molecular domains demonstrated that MVCIB consistently outperforms baselines in both predictive performance and interpretability. Moreover, MVCIB achieved the 3d Weisfeiler-Lehman expressiveness power to distinguish not only non-isomorphic graphs but also different 3D geometries that share identical 2D connectivity, such as isomers."}

We present a variational autoencoder (VAE) approach that achieves x514 compression of NASA's TEMPO satellite hyperspectral observations (1028 channels, 290-490nm) with reconstruction errors 1-2 orders of magnitude below the signal across all wavelengths. This dramatic data volume reduction enables efficient archival and sharing of satellite observations while preserving spectral fidelity. Beyond compression, we investigate to what extent atmospheric information is retained in the compressed latent space by training linear and nonlinear probes to extract Level-2 products (NO2, O3, HCHO, cloud fraction). Cloud fraction and total ozone achieve strong extraction performance (R^2 = 0.93 and 0.81 respectively), though these represent relatively straightforward retrievals given their distinct spectral signatures. In contrast, tropospheric trace gases pose genuine challenges for extraction (NO2 R^2 = 0.20, HCHO R^2 = 0.51) reflecting their weaker signals and complex atmospheric interactions. Critically, we find the VAE encodes atmospheric information in a semi-linear manner - nonlinear probes substantially outperform linear ones - and that explicit latent supervision during training provides minimal improvement, revealing fundamental encoding challenges for certain products.

Non-sampling frameworks like Multiple Choice Learning (MCL) offer an efficient alternative, but suffer from severe training instability and hypothesis collapse, which has historically hindered their performance. This problem is dramatically exacerbated when attempting to combine them with modern, efficient MLP-based backbones. To resolve this fundamental incompatibility, we propose TimePre, a novel framework that successfully unifies the efficiency of MLP-based models with the distributional flexibility of the MCL paradigm. The core of our solution is Stabilized Instance Normalization (SIN), a novel normalization layer that explicitly remedies this incompatibility. SIN stabilizes the hybrid architecture by correcting channel-wise statistical shifts, definitively resolving the catastrophic hypothesis collapse. Extensive experiments on six benchmark datasets demonstrate that TimePre achieves new state-of-the-art accuracy on key probabilistic metrics. Critically, TimePre achieves inference speeds orders of magnitude faster than sampling-based models and, unlike prior MCL work, demonstrates stable performance scaling. It thus bridges the long-standing gap between accuracy, efficiency, and stability in probabilistic forecasting."}

Moreover, variability in electrode montage across available datasets, along with inter-subject differences in brain signals, pose significant challenges to developing a generalizable and robust foundation model. We propose \\textit{SAMBA}, a self-supervised learning framework with a Mamba-based U-shaped encoder-decoder architecture, which effectively captures long-range temporal dependencies and spatial variability in EEG data. Leveraging the inherent ability of Mamba in processing long context sizes, we introduce: (1) \\textit{Temporal Semantic Random Masking} for semantic-level sequence reconstruction, (2) a \\textit{Multi-Head Differential Mamba} module to suppress redundancy and emphasize salient temporal structures, and (3) a \\textit{Spatial-Adaptive Input Embedding} that learns unified embeddings in a three-dimensional Euclidean space, enabling robustness across devices.

To address these limitations, we introduce CycleSL, a novel aggregation-free split learning framework that enhances scalability and performance and can be seamlessly integrated with existing methods. Inspired by alternating block coordinate descent, CycleSL treats server-side training as an independent higher-level machine learning task, resampling client-extracted features (smashed data) to mitigate heterogeneity and drift. It then performs cyclical updates, namely optimizing the server model first, followed by client updates using the updated server for gradient computation. We integrate CycleSL into previous algorithms and benchmark them on five publicly available datasets with non-iid data distribution and partial client attendance.

To accurately estimate the test priors and enhance classification accuracy, we propose a Bayesian framework for label shift estimation, termed Full Maximum A Posterior Label Shift (FMAPLS), along with its online version, online-FMAPLS. Leveraging batch and online Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithms, these methods jointly and dynamically optimize Dirichlet hyperparameters $\\boldsymbolα$ and class priors $\\boldsymbolπ$, thereby overcoming the rigid constraints of the existing Maximum A Posterior Label Shift (MAPLS) approach.

The online variant substitutes the batch E-step with a stochastic approximation, enabling real-time adaptation to streaming data. Furthermore, our theoretical analysis reveals a fundamental trade-off between online convergence rate and estimation accuracy. Extensive experiments on CIFAR100 and ImageNet datasets under shuffled long-tail and Dirichlet test priors demonstrate that FMAPLS and online-FMAPLS respectively achieve up to 40% and 12% lower KL divergence and substantial improvements in post-shift accuracy over state-of-the-art baselines, particularly under severe class imbalance and distributional uncertainty.

Best-of-N (BoN) selects the output with the highest reward, and with perfect rewards, it often achieves near-perfect accuracy. With imperfect rewards from reward models, however, BoN fails to reliably find the correct answer and its performance degrades drastically. We consider the distribution of BoN's outputs and highlight that, although the correct answer does not usually have a probability close to one under imperfect rewards, it is often the most likely outcome. This suggests that the mode of this distribution can be more reliably correct than a sample from it. Based on this idea, we propose Majority-of-the-Bests (MoB), a novel selection mechanism that estimates the output distribution of BoN via bootstrapping and selects its mode. Experimental results across five benchmarks, three different base LLMs, and two reward models demonstrate consistent improvements over BoN in 25 out of 30 setups. We also provide theoretical results for the consistency of the bootstrapping. MoB serves as a simple, yet strong alternative to BoN and self-consistency, and more broadly, motivates further research in more nuanced selection mechanisms."}

The chatbot was fine-tuned using a hybrid corpus of real and synthetically generated medical dialogues, while model efficiency was optimized via Low-Rank Adaptation. A secure and isolated database interface was implemented to ensure complete separation between patient data and the inference process.

While 4-bit KV quantization preserves accuracy, 2-bit often degrades it, especially on long-context reasoning. We close this gap via an algorithm-system co-design for mixed-precision KV caching: Kitty. On the algorithm side, extensive experiments show that Dynamic Channel-wise Precision Boost -- which ranks Key-cache channels by sensitivity and keeps only a small fraction at higher precision -- maintains near-zero loss in accuracy drop while approaching 2-bit memory. The main challenge is handling dynamic 4-bit channel boosts while keeping the page layout coalesced and the dequantization uniform, with no scattered reads or hard-coded masks. Kitty addresses these issues by decompose each mixed-precision Key page into two tensors with unified 2-bit precision. Based on this, Kitty provides a page-centric KV layout, Triton-compatible page dequantization kernels, and a lightweight runtime pipeline that preserves coalescing and avoids divergence. Across seven tasks and two model families (Qwen3, LLaMA3), Kitty cuts KV memory by nearly 8x with negligible accuracy loss, enabling up to 8x larger batches and 2.1x-4.1x higher throughput under the same memory budget.

Corrective Machine Unlearning (CMU) seeks to remove the influence of such corruption post-training. Prior CMU typically assumes access to identified corrupted training samples (a ``forget set''). However, in many real-world scenarios the training data are no longer accessible. We formalize \\emph{source-free} CMU, where the original training data are unavailable and, consequently, no forget set of identified corrupted training samples can be specified. Instead, we assume a small proxy (surrogate) set of corrupted samples that reflect the suspected corruption type without needing to be the original training samples. In this stricter setting, methods relying on forget set are ineffective or narrow in scope. We introduce \\textit{Corrective Unlearning in Task Space} (CUTS), a lightweight weight space correction method guided by the proxy set using task arithmetic principles. CUTS treats the clean and the corruption signal as distinct tasks. Specifically, we briefly fine-tune the corrupted model on the proxy to amplify the corruption mechanism in the weight space, compute the difference between the corrupted and fine-tuned weights as a proxy task vector, and subtract a calibrated multiple of this vector to cancel the corruption. Without access to clean data or a forget set, CUTS recovers a large fraction of the lost utility under label noise and, for backdoor triggers, nearly eliminates the attack with minimal damage to utility, outperforming state-of-the-art specialized CMU methods in source-free setting."}

In this paper, we present QuantKAN, a unified framework for quantizing KANs across both quantization aware training (QAT) and post-training quantization (PTQ) regimes. QuantKAN extends modern quantization algorithms, such as LSQ, LSQ+, PACT, DoReFa, QIL, GPTQ, BRECQ, AdaRound, AWQ, and HAWQ-V2, to spline based layers with branch-specific quantizers for base, spline, and activation components.

For PTQ, GPTQ and Uniform consistently deliver the strongest overall performance across datasets, with BRECQ highly competitive on simpler regimes such as MNIST.

Accurately forecasting the total number of each action that each player will complete during a match is desirable for a variety of applications, including tactical decision-making, sports betting, and for television broadcast commentary and analysis. Such predictions must consider the game state, the ability and skill of the players in both teams, the interactions between the players, and the temporal dynamics of the game as it develops. In this paper, we present a transformer-based neural network that jointly and recurrently predicts the expected totals for thirteen individual actions at multiple time-steps during the match, and where predictions are made for each individual player, each team and at the game-level. The neural network is based on an \\emph{axial transformer} that efficiently captures the temporal dynamics as the game progresses, and the interactions between the players at each time-step.

To address this issue, we propose a unified framework, SC-SSL, which suppresses model bias through decoupled sampling control.

While existing literature has designed many sophisticated decomposition approaches based on the time or frequency domain to partition trend-seasonality components and high-low frequency components, an alternative line of approaches based on the wavelet domain has been proposed to provide a unified multi-resolution representation with precise time-frequency localization. However, most wavelet-based methods suffer from a persistent bias toward recursively decomposing only low-frequency components, severely underutilizing subtle yet informative high-frequency components that are pivotal for precise time series forecasting. To address this problem, we propose WaveTuner, a Wavelet decomposition framework empowered by full-spectrum subband Tuning for time series forecasting. Concretely, WaveTuner comprises two key modules: (i) Adaptive Wavelet Refinement module, that transforms time series into time-frequency coefficients, utilizes an adaptive router to dynamically assign subband weights, and generates subband-specific embeddings to support refinement; and (ii) Multi-Branch Specialization module, that employs multiple functional branches, each instantiated as a flexible Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) with a distinct functional order to model a specific spectral subband. Equipped with these modules, WaveTuner comprehensively tunes global trends and local variations within a unified time-frequency framework.

One representative fine-tuning method is to exploit adapter (termed AdapterGNN) which aims to 'augment' the pre-trained model by inserting a lightweight module to make the 'augmented' model better adapt to the downstream tasks. However, graph data may contain various types of noise in downstream tasks, such as noisy edges and ambiguous node attributes. Existing AdapterGNNs are often prone to graph noise and exhibit limited generalizability. How to enhance the robustness and generalization ability of GNNs' fine tuning remains an open problem. In this paper, we show that the above problem can be well addressed by integrating uncertainty learning into the GNN adapter. We propose the Uncertainty-aware Adapter (UAdapterGNN) that fortifies pre-trained GNN models against noisy graph data in the fine-tuning process. Specifically, in contrast to regular AdapterGNN, our UAdapterGNN exploits Gaussian probabilistic adapter to augment the pre-trained GNN model. In this way, when the graph contains various noises,our method can automatically absorb the effects of changes in the variances of the Gaussian distribution, thereby significantly enhancing the model's robustness. Also, UAdapterGNN can further improve the generalization ability of the model on the downstream tasks. Extensive experiments on several benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness, robustness and high generalization ability of the proposed UAdapterGNN method."}

In this study, we are returning to the strategy of separating inference and training deployment, and by introducing improvements in the data loader, we transform the conventional synchronous architecture into a periodically asynchronous framework, which allows for demand-driven, independent, and elastic scaling of each component, while the accuracy of the algorithm remains completely equivalent to the synchronization method, with both belonging to the on-policy strategy.

While previous work on SLM design has primarily focused on reducing the number of parameters to achieve parameter-optimal SLMs, parameter efficiency does not necessarily translate into proportional real-device speed-ups. This work aims to identify the key determinants of SLMs' real-device latency and offer generalizable principles and methodologies for SLM design and training when real-device latency is the primary consideration. Specifically, we identify two central architectural factors: depth-width ratios and operator choices. The former is crucial for small-batch-size latency, while the latter affects both latency and large-batch-size throughput. In light of this, we first study latency-optimal depth-width ratios, with the key finding that although deep-thin models generally achieve better accuracy under the same parameter budget, they may not lie on the accuracy-latency trade-off frontier. Next, we explore emerging efficient attention alternatives to evaluate their potential as candidate building operators. Using the identified promising operators, we construct an evolutionary search framework to automatically discover latency-optimal combinations of these operators within hybrid SLMs, thereby advancing the accuracy-latency frontier. In addition to architectural improvements, we further enhance SLM training using a weight normalization technique that enables more effective weight updates and improves final convergence. Combining these methods, we introduce a new family of hybrid SLMs, called Nemotron-Flash, which significantly advances the accuracy-efficiency frontier of state-of-the-art SLMs, e.g., achieving over +5.5% average accuracy, 1.3x/1.9x lower latency, and 18.7x/45.6x higher throughput compared to Qwen3-1.7B/0.6B, respectively."}

Existing attempts to mitigate this issue fall into two paradigms: filtering-based and sampling-based methods. Filtering-based methods first generate rollouts broadly and then retroactively filter out uninformative groups, leading to substantial computational overhead.

A natural approach to better leverage high-quality data is curriculum-based pretraining, where the model is trained on data sorted in ascending order of quality as determined by a quality metric. However, prior studies have reported limited improvements from such curriculum-based pretraining strategies. This work identifies a critical factor constraining these methods: the incompatibility between the ascending data quality order and the decaying learning rate (LR) schedule. We find that while curriculum-based training substantially outperforms random shuffling when using a constant LR, its advantage diminishes under standard LR decay schedules. Our experiments show this incompatibility can be mitigated by two simple strategies: (1) employing a more moderate LR decay schedule, where the final LR is only moderately smaller than the peak LR, and (2) replacing LR decay with model averaging, i.e., computing a weighted average of the final few checkpoints. By combining these strategies, we improve the average score on a suite of standard benchmarks by 1.64% over random shuffling, without additional data refinement. Validated on 1.5B-parameter models trained over 30B tokens with various data-quality metrics, our findings call for a re-evaluation of curriculum-based LLM pretraining and underscore the potential of co-designing data curricula with optimization methods."}

Our preprocessing modules, DCR and RiFU, extend Riemannian Alignment by improving action separation while reducing subject-specific distortions. We further propose two manifold classifiers, SPD-DCNet and RiFUNet, which use hierarchical congruence transforms to learn discriminative, subject-invariant covariance representations.

Since any MI estimator is a function of the observed sample from two random variables, we parameterize this function with a neural network (MIST) and train it end-to-end to predict MI values. Training is performed on a large meta-dataset of 625,000 synthetic joint distributions with known ground-truth MI. To handle variable sample sizes and dimensions, we employ a two-dimensional attention scheme ensuring permutation invariance across input samples. To quantify uncertainty, we optimize a quantile regression loss, enabling the estimator to approximate the sampling distribution of MI rather than return a single point estimate. This research program departs from prior work by taking a fully empirical route, trading universal theoretical guarantees for flexibility and efficiency. Empirically, the learned estimators largely outperform classical baselines across sample sizes and dimensions, including on joint distributions unseen during training. The resulting quantile-based intervals are well-calibrated and more reliable than bootstrap-based confidence intervals, while inference is orders of magnitude faster than existing neural baselines. Beyond immediate empirical gains, this framework yields trainable, fully differentiable estimators that can be embedded into larger learning pipelines. Moreover, exploiting MI's invariance to invertible transformations, meta-datasets can be adapted to arbitrary data modalities via normalizing flows, enabling flexible training for diverse target meta-distributions."}

Cutter incorporates three key strategies to enhance learning efficiency and compression quality: trajectory-level reward shaping to transform sparse trajectory returns into dense, policy-equivalent learning signals; prototype-based shaping to guide decisions using behavioral patterns from both highand low-return trajectories; and cross-agent imitation to enable safer and more transferable exploration. Experiments on multiple real-world graphs demonstrate that Cutter generates compressed graphs that retain essential static topological properties and exhibit robustness degradation trends highly consistent with the original graphs under various attack scenarios, thereby significantly improving evaluation efficiency without compromising assessment fidelity."}

However, existing VLA models, often built upon Vision-Language Models (VLMs), typically process dense visual inputs independently at each timestep. This approach implicitly models the task as a Markov Decision Process (MDP). However, this history-agnostic design is suboptimal for effective visual token processing in dynamic sequential decision-making, as it fails to leverage the context of history. To address this limitation, we reformulate the problem from a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) perspective and propose a novel framework named AVA-VLA. Inspired by the POMDP that the action generation should be conditioned on the belief state. AVA-VLA introduces Active Visual Attention (AVA) to dynamically modulate visual processing. It achieves this by leveraging the recurrent state, which is a neural approximation of the agent's belief state derived from the previous decision step. Specifically, the AVA module uses the recurrent state to compute the soft weights to actively process task-relevant visual tokens based on its historical context. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that AVA-VLA achieves state-of-the-art performance across popular robotic benchmarks, including LIBERO and CALVIN. Furthermore, real-world deployments on a dual-arm robot platform validate the framework's practical applicability and robust sim-to-real transferability."}

While heuristic methods are fast but yield suboptimal performance, more powerful search-based approaches like Reinforcement Learning are often hindered by prohibitive computational costs on large-scale models. To overcome this efficiency barrier, we propose FastForward Pruning. Its core is a decoupled, single-step RL framework that separates policy optimization from the complex budget satisfaction problem. Such a decoupling is crucial for efficiently searching the vast policy space of LLMs. This curriculum-based strategy begins with low-cost, simple tasks and gradually increases in complexity, significantly reducing the search's computational overhead. Evaluated on the LLaMA, Mistral, and OPT model families, our framework discovers pruning policies that achieve superior performance over strong heuristic baselines. Crucially, when compared to other search-based algorithms, our method achieves competitive or superior results at a fraction of the computational cost, demonstrating a clear advantage in search efficiency."}

Reliable connectivity remains a critical yet challenging task due to three-dimensional (3D) mobility, time-varying user density, and limited power budgets. The transmit power of base stations (BSs) fluctuates dynamically according to user locations and traffic demands, leading to a highly non-stationary 3D radio environment. Radio maps (RMs) have emerged as an effective means to characterize spatial power distributions and support radio-aware network optimization. However, most existing works construct static or offline RMs, overlooking real-time power variations and spatio-temporal dependencies in multi-UAV networks. To overcome this limitation, we propose a {3D dynamic radio map (3D-DRM)} framework that learns and predicts the spatio-temporal evolution of received power. Specially, a Vision Transformer (ViT) encoder extracts high-dimensional spatial representations from 3D RMs, while a Transformer-based module models sequential dependencies to predict future power distributions. Experiments unveil that 3D-DRM accurately captures fast-varying power dynamics and substantially outperforms baseline models in both RM reconstruction and short-term prediction."}

However, existing approaches predominantly rely on external human-annotated preference data, which is costly and labor-intensive to collect. In this work, we propose OrdMoE, a novel preference alignment framework that bypasses the reliance on external human preferences entirely by leveraging intrinsic signals within Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures. Specifically, we observe that the router's expert selection scores implicitly encode a quality-aware ranking of responses (i.e. higher-scoring experts consistently generate higher-quality outputs). Building on this insight, OrdMoE constructs an internal preference hierarchy by grouping experts into ranked tiers based on their per-token routing scores and activating each tier separately to produce a sequence of responses with increasing quality. This yields a zero-cost, self-supervised preference ordering over generated responses, which can be directly optimized using standard preference learning objectives. Extensive experiments across multiple multimodal benchmarks demnstrate that OrdMoE significantly enhances both alignment and overall performance of multimodal Mixture-of-Experts LLMs, achieving competitive results without requiring any human-annotated preference data."}

We prove that this encoding yields node identifiability from a constant number of observations and establishes a sample-complexity separation from architectures constrained by the Weisfeiler-Lehman test. The analysis combines a monotone link between shortest-path and diffusion distance, spectral trilateration with a constant set of anchors, and quantitative spectral injectivity with logarithmic embedding size.

As a result, clients perform their local training on different model versions, causing information staleness (delay). In federated environments with non-IID local data distributions, this asynchronous pattern amplifies the adverse effect of client heterogeneity (due to different data distribution, local objectives, etc.), as faster clients contribute more frequent updates, biasing the global model. We term this phenomenon heterogeneity amplification. Our work provides a theoretical analysis that maps AFL design choices to their resulting error sources when heterogeneity amplification occurs. Guided by our analysis, we propose ACE (All-Client Engagement AFL), which mitigates participation imbalance through immediate, non-buffered updates that use the latest information available from all clients. We also introduce a delay-aware variant, ACED, to balance client diversity against update staleness. Experiments on different models for different tasks across diverse heterogeneity and delay settings validate our analysis and demonstrate the robust performance of our approaches."}

Prior work has focused on endpoint metrics (e.g., fidelity, likelihood, perceptual quality) while overlooking a deeper question: what do the sampling trajectories reveal? Motivated by classical mechanics, we introduce kinetic path energy (KPE), a simple yet powerful diagnostic that quantifies the total kinetic effort along each generation path of ODE-based samplers. Through comprehensive experiments on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet-256, we uncover two key phenomena: ({i}) higher KPE predicts stronger semantic quality, indicating that semantically richer samples require greater kinetic effort, and ({ii}) higher KPE inversely correlates with data density, with informative samples residing in sparse, low-density regions. Together, these findings reveal that semantically informative samples naturally reside on the sparse frontier of the data distribution, demanding greater generative effort. Our results suggest that trajectory-level analysis offers a physics-inspired and interpretable framework for understanding generation difficulty and sample characteristics."}

This is particularly problematic in resource-constrained and remote environments where bandwidth is limited, and battery-dependent devices further emphasize the problem. Moreover, in domains such as agriculture, consecutive sensor readings often have minimal variation, making continuous data transmission inefficient and unnecessarily resource intensive. To overcome these challenges, we propose an analytical prediction algorithm designed for edge computing environments and validated through simulation. The proposed solution utilizes a predictive filter at the network edge that forecasts the next sensor data point and triggers data transmission only when the deviation from the predicted value exceeds a predefined tolerance. A complementary cloud-based model ensures data integrity and overall system consistency. This dual-model strategy effectively reduces communication overhead and demonstrates potential for improving energy efficiency by minimizing redundant transmissions. In addition to reducing communication load, our approach leverages both in situ and satellite observations from the same locations to enhance model robustness. It also supports cross-site generalization, enabling models trained in one region to be effectively deployed elsewhere without retraining. This makes our solution highly scalable, energy-aware, and well-suited for optimizing sensor data transmission in remote and bandwidth-constrained IoT environments."}

We answer this in the affirmative, showing that the continuous-time variational objective of MDMs, when equipped with multivariate noise schedules, can identify and optimize for a decoding order during training. We establish a direct correspondence between decoding order and the multivariate noise schedule and show that this setting breaks invariance of the MDM objective to the noise schedule. Furthermore, we prove that the MDM objective decomposes precisely into a weighted auto-regressive losses over these orders, which establishes them as auto-regressive models with learnable orders."}

We propose MAESTRO (Multi-Agent Environment Shaping through Task and Reward Optimization), a framework that moves the LLM outside the execution loop and uses it as an offline training architect.

These components guide a standard MARL backbone (MADDPG) without increasing inference cost at deployment. We evaluate MAESTRO on large-scale traffic signal control (Hangzhou, 16 intersections) and conduct controlled ablations. Results show that combining LLM-generated curricula with LLM-generated reward shaping yields improved performance and stability.

However, their performance as multi-scale devices is determined by complex interactions between their constituent layers. This creates a vast combinatorial space of possible materials and device architectures, making the conventional experimental-based screening process slow and expensive. Machine learning models try to address this problem, but they only focus on individual material properties or neglect the important geometric information of the perovskite crystal. To address this problem, we propose to predict perovskite solar cell power conversion efficiency with a geometric-aware co-attention (Solar-GECO) model. Solar-GECO combines a geometric graph neural network (GNN) - that directly encodes the atomic structure of the perovskite absorber - with language model embeddings that process the textual strings representing the chemical compounds of the transport layers and other device components. Solar-GECO also integrates a co-attention module to capture intra-layer dependencies and inter-layer interactions, while a probabilistic regression head predicts both power conversion efficiency (PCE) and its associated uncertainty. Solar-GECO achieves state-of-the-art performance, significantly outperforming several baselines, reducing the mean absolute error (MAE) for PCE prediction from 3.066 to 2.936 compared to semantic GNN (the previous state-of-the-art model). Solar-GECO demonstrates that integrating geometric and textual information provides a more powerful and accurate framework for PCE prediction."}

MI is the process of studying the inner computations of neural networks and translating them into human-understandable algorithms. It encompasses reverse engineering techniques aimed at uncovering the computational algorithms implemented by neural networks. In this article, we propose a unified taxonomy of MI approaches and provide a detailed analysis of key techniques, illustrated with concrete examples and pseudo-code. We contextualize MI within the broader interpretability landscape, comparing its goals, methods, and insights to other strands of XAI. Additionally, we trace the development of MI as a research area, highlighting its conceptual roots and the accelerating pace of recent work. We argue that MI holds significant potential to support a more scientific understanding of machine learning systems -- treating models not only as tools for solving tasks, but also as systems to be studied and understood. We hope to invite new researchers into the field of mechanistic interpretability."}

To bridge this gap, we introduce MapFormers, new architectures based on Transformer models, which can learn cognitive maps from observational data and perform path integration in parallel, in a self-supervised manner. Cognitive maps are learned in the model by disentangling structural relationships in the inputs from their specific content, a property that can be achieved naturally by updating the positional encoding in Transformers with input-dependent matrices. We developed two variants of MapFormers that unify absolute and relative positional encoding to model episodic (EM) and working memory (WM), respectively. We tested MapFormers on several tasks, including a classic 2D navigation task, showing that our models can learn a cognitive map of the underlying space and generalize OOD (e.g., to longer sequences) with near-perfect performance, unlike current architectures. Together, these results demonstrate the superiority of models designed to learn a cognitive map, and the importance of introducing a structural bias for structure-content disentanglement, which can be achieved in Transformers with input-dependent positional encoding. MapFormers have broad applications in both neuroscience and AI, by explaining the neural mechanisms giving rise to cognitive maps, while allowing these relation models to be learned at scale."}

These models, referred to as genomic language mod- els (gLMs), have demonstrated impressive predictive and generative capabilities, raising concerns that such models may also enable misuse, for instance via the generation of genomes for human-infecting viruses. These concerns have catalyzed calls for risk mitigation measures. The de facto mitigation of choice is filtering of pretraining data (i.e., removing viral genomic sequences from training datasets) in order to limit gLM performance on virus-related tasks. However, it is not currently known how robust this approach is for securing open-source models that can be fine-tuned using sensitive pathogen data. Here, we evaluate a state-of-the-art gLM, Evo 2, and perform fine-tuning using sequences from 110 harmful human-infecting viruses to assess the rescue of misuse-relevant predictive capabilities. The fine- tuned model exhibited reduced perplexity on unseen viral sequences relative to 1) the pretrained model and 2) a version fine-tuned on bacteriophage sequences. The model fine-tuned on human-infecting viruses also identified immune escape variants from SARS-CoV-2 (achieving an AUROC of 0.6), despite having no expo- sure to SARS-CoV-2 sequences during fine-tuning. This work demonstrates that data exclusion might be circumvented by fine-tuning approaches that can, to some degree, rescue misuse-relevant capabilities of gLMs. We highlight the need for safety frameworks for gLMs and outline further work needed on evaluations and mitigation measures to enable the safe deployment of gLMs."}

In this work, we use the Alchemy benchmark, to investigate the dynamics of latent structure learning. We train a small decoder-only transformer on three task variants: 1) inferring missing rules from partial contextual information, 2) composing simple rules to solve multi-step sequences, and 3) decomposing complex multi-step examples to infer intermediate steps. By factorizing each task into interpretable events, we show that the model acquires capabilities in discrete stages, first learning the coarse grained rules, before learning the complete latent structure. We also identify a crucial asymmetry, where the model can compose fundamental rules robustly, but struggles to decompose complex examples to discover the fundamental rules. These findings offer new insights into understanding how a transformer model learns latent structures, providing a granular view of how these capabilities evolve during training."}

Adversarial attacks have been deeply investigated in the image domain; however, there is less research in the time-series domain and very little for forecasting financial data. To address these concerns, this study aims to build upon previous research on adversarial attacks for time-series data by introducing two new slope-based methods aimed to alter the trends of the predicted stock forecast generated by an N-HiTS model. Compared to the normal N-HiTS predictions, the two new slope-based methods, the General Slope Attack and Least-Squares Slope Attack, can manipulate N-HiTS predictions by doubling the slope. These new slope attacks can bypass standard security mechanisms, such as a discriminator that filters real and perturbed inputs, reducing a 4-layered CNN's specificity to 28% and accuracy to 57%. Furthermore, the slope based methods were incorporated into a GAN architecture as a means of generating realistic synthetic data, while simultaneously fooling the model. Finally, this paper also proposes a sample malware designed to inject an adversarial attack in the model inference library, proving that ML-security research should not only focus on making the model safe, but also securing the entire pipeline."}

In this work, we revisit the fundamental assumptions of continual learning and ask: Can current systems adapt when labels are absent and tasks emerge incrementally over time? To this end, we introduce Annotation-Free Class-Incremental Learning (AFCIL), a more realistic and challenging paradigm where unlabeled data arrives continuously, and the learner must incrementally acquire new classes without any supervision. To enable effective learning under AFCIL, we propose CrossWorld CL, a Cross Domain World Guided Continual Learning framework that incorporates external world knowledge as a stable auxiliary source. The method retrieves semantically related ImageNet classes for each downstream category, maps downstream and ImageNet features through a cross domain alignment strategy and finally introduce a novel replay strategy. This design lets the model uncover semantic structure without annotations while keeping earlier knowledge intact. Across four datasets, CrossWorld-CL surpasses CLIP baselines and existing continual and unlabeled learning methods, underscoring the benefit of world knowledge for annotation free continual learning."}

This sampling approach enables our estimator to efficiently scale to large datasets without sacrificing reliability. To support intrinsic evaluation of cluster quality without ground-truth labels, we propose the Cohesion Ratio, a simple and interpretable evaluation metric that quantifies how much intra-cluster similarity exceeds the global similarity background. It has an information-theoretic motivation inspired by mutual information, and in our experiments it correlates closely with extrinsic measures such as normalized mutual information and homogeneity. Extensive experiments on six short-text datasets and four modern embedding models show that standard algorithms like K-Means and HAC, when guided by our estimator, significantly outperform popular parameter-light methods such as HDBSCAN, OPTICS, and Leiden. These results demonstrate the practical value of our spectral estimator and Cohesion Ratio for unsupervised organization and evaluation of short text data.

Previous work and recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated their potential for automating the generation of reward functions. However, existing methodologies often require preliminary evaluation metrics, human-engineered feedback for the refinement process, or the use of environmental source code as context. To address these limitations, this paper introduces LEARN-Opt (LLM-based Evaluator and Analyzer for Reward functioN Optimization). This LLM-based, fully autonomous, and model-agnostic framework eliminates the need for preliminary metrics and environmental source code as context to generate, execute, and evaluate reward function candidates from textual descriptions of systems and task objectives. LEARN-Opt's main contribution lies in its ability to autonomously derive performance metrics directly from the system description and the task objective, enabling unsupervised evaluation and selection of reward functions. Our experiments indicate that LEARN-Opt achieves performance comparable to or better to that of state-of-the-art methods, such as EUREKA, while requiring less prior knowledge. We find that automated reward design is a high-variance problem, where the average-case candidate fails, requiring a multi-run approach to find the best candidates. Finally, we show that LEARN-Opt can unlock the potential of low-cost LLMs to find high-performing candidates that are comparable to, or even better than, those of larger models. This demonstrated performance affirms its potential to generate high-quality reward functions without requiring any preliminary human-defined metrics, thereby reducing engineering overhead and enhancing generalizability."}

Instead of predicting a single class, CP generates a prediction set, guaranteed to include the true label with a pre-specified probability. The performance of different CP methods is typically assessed by their average prediction set size. In setups where the classes can be partitioned into semantic groups, e.g., diseases that require similar treatment, users can benefit from prediction sets that are not only small on average, but also contain a small number of semantically different groups. This paper begins by addressing this problem and ultimately offers a widely applicable tool for boosting any CP method on any dataset. First, given a class partition, we propose augmenting the CP score function with a term that penalizes predictions with out-of-group errors. We theoretically analyze this strategy and prove its advantages for group-related metrics. Surprisingly, we show mathematically that, for common class partitions, it can also reduce the average set size of any CP score function. Our analysis reveals the class similarity factors behind this improvement and motivates us to propose a model-specific variant, which does not require any human semantic partition and can further reduce the prediction set size. Finally, we present an extensive empirical study, encompassing prominent CP methods, multiple models, and several datasets, which demonstrates that our class-similarity-based approach consistently enhances CP methods."}

Here, we show how neural surrogate models can significantly reduce reliance on such slow simulators while preserving accuracy. Taking the design of interferometric gravitational wave detectors as a representative example, we train a neural network to surrogate the gravitational wave physics simulator Finesse, which was developed by the LIGO community. Despite that small changes in physical parameters can change the output by orders of magnitudes, the model rapidly predicts the quality and feasibility of candidate designs, allowing an efficient exploration of large design spaces. Our algorithm loops between training the surrogate, inverse designing new experiments, and verifying their properties with the slow simulator for further training. Assisted by auto-differentiation and GPU parallelism, our method proposes high-quality experiments much faster than direct optimization. Solutions that our algorithm finds within hours outperform designs that take five days for the optimizer to reach.

Our geometric analysis reveals that Flow Matching learns a highly rectified transport path (Curvature $\\mathcal{C} \\approx 1.02$), which is near-optimal, whereas Diffusion trajectories remain stochastic and tortuous ($\\mathcal{C} \\approx 3.45$). Furthermore, we establish an ``efficiency frontier'' at $N=10$ function evaluations, where Flow Matching retains high fidelity while Diffusion collapses. Finally, we show via numerical sensitivity analysis that the learned vector field is sufficiently linear to render high-order ODE solvers (Runge-Kutta 4) unnecessary, validating the use of lightweight Euler solvers for edge deployment. \\textbf{This work concludes that Flow Matching is the superior algorithmic choice for real-time, resource-constrained generative tasks.}"}

However, in many settings, the available information at a given time represents only a small fraction of what is needed to predict future states, either due to measurement uncertainty or because only a small fraction of the state can be observed. This is true for example in solar physics, where we can observe the Sun's surface and atmosphere, but its evolution is driven by internal processes for which we lack direct measurements. In this paper, we tackle the probabilistic prediction of partially observable, long-memory dynamical systems, with applications to solar dynamics and the evolution of active regions. We show that standard inference schemes, such as autoregressive rollouts, fail to capture long-range dependencies in the data, largely because they do not integrate past information effectively. To overcome this, we propose a multiscale inference scheme for diffusion models, tailored to physical processes. Our method generates trajectories that are temporally fine-grained near the present and coarser as we move farther away, which enables capturing long-range temporal dependencies without increasing computational cost. When integrated into a diffusion model, we show that our inference scheme significantly reduces the bias of the predicted distributions and improves rollout stability."}

These multi-agent interactions pose a fundamental challenge, particularly in social dilemmas, where agents' individual incentives can undermine collective welfare. While reinforcement learning (RL) has been effective for aligning large language models (LLMs) in the single-agent regime, prior small-network results suggest that standard RL in multi-agent settings often converges to defecting, self-interested policies. We show the same effect in LLMs: despite cooperative priors, RL-trained LLM agents develop opportunistic behavior that can exploit even advanced closed-source models. To address this tendency of RL to converge to poor equilibria, we adapt a recent opponent-learning awareness algorithm, Advantage Alignment, to fine-tune LLMs toward multi-agent cooperation and non-exploitability. We then introduce a group-relative baseline that simplifies advantage computation in iterated games, enabling multi-agent training at LLM scale. We also contribute a novel social dilemma environment, Trust and Split, which requires natural language communication to achieve high collective welfare. Across a wide range of social dilemmas, policies learned with Advantage Alignment achieve higher collective payoffs while remaining robust against exploitation by greedy agents."}

However, UMMs still exhibit a fundamental inconsistency: understanding favors compact embeddings, whereas generation favors reconstruction-rich representations. This structural trade-off produces misaligned decision boundaries, degraded cross-modal coherence, and heightened vulnerability under distributional and adversarial shifts. In this paper, we present UniGame, a self-adversarial post-training framework that directly targets the inconsistencies. By applying a lightweight perturber at the shared token interface, UniGame enables the generation branch to actively seek and challenge fragile understanding, turning the model itself into its own adversary. Experiments demonstrate that UniGame significantly improves the consistency (+4.6%). Moreover, it also achieves substantial improvements in understanding (+3.6%), generation (+0.02), out-of-distribution and adversarial robustness (+4.8% and +6.2% on NaturalBench and AdVQA). The framework is architecture-agnostic, introduces less than 1% additional parameters, and is complementary to existing post-training methods. These results position adversarial self-play as a general and effective principle for enhancing the coherence, stability, and unified competence of future multimodal foundation models.

To accelerate this, flow maps can be distilled from pre-trained teachers, a procedure that conventionally requires sampling from an external dataset. We argue that this data-dependency introduces a fundamental risk of Teacher-Data Mismatch, as a static dataset may provide an incomplete or even misaligned representation of the teacher's full generative capabilities. This leads us to question whether this reliance on data is truly necessary for successful flow map distillation. In this work, we explore a data-free alternative that samples only from the prior distribution, a distribution the teacher is guaranteed to follow by construction, thereby circumventing the mismatch risk entirely. To demonstrate the practical viability of this philosophy, we introduce a principled framework that learns to predict the teacher's sampling path while actively correcting for its own compounding errors to ensure high fidelity. Our approach surpasses all data-based counterparts and establishes a new state-of-the-art by a significant margin. Specifically, distilling from SiT-XL/2+REPA, our method reaches an impressive FID of 1.45 on ImageNet 256x256, and 1.49 on ImageNet 512x512, both with only 1 sampling step. We hope our work establishes a more robust paradigm for accelerating generative models and motivates the broader adoption of flow map distillation without data."}

Paper is currently under review. Authors' version posted for personal use and not for redistribution", "summary": "Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) in disaster response require complex, queryable intelligence that on-board CNNs cannot provide. While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) offer this semantic reasoning, their high resource demands make on-device deployment infeasible, and naive cloud offloading fails under the low-bandwidth networks common in disaster zones. We present AVERY, a framework that enables VLM deployment through adaptive split computing. We advance the split computing paradigm beyond traditional depth-wise partitioning by introducing a functional, cognitive-inspired dual-stream split that separates the VLM into a high-frequency, low-resolution \"context stream\" for real-time awareness and a low-frequency, high-fidelity \"insight stream\" for deep analysis. A lightweight, self-aware on-board controller manages this architecture, monitoring network conditions and operator intent to dynamically select from pre-trained compression models, navigating the fundamental accuracy-throughput trade-off. Evaluated using the VLM LISA-7B across an edge-cloud scenario under fluctuating network conditions, AVERY consistently outperforms static configurations, achieving 11.2% higher accuracy than raw image compression and 93.98% lower energy consumption compared to full-edge execution, thereby enhancing mission efficiency and enabling real-time, queryable intelligence on resource-constrained platforms in dynamic environments."}
