Prior PIM\narchitectures have shown potential to improve energy efficiency and\nperformance. However, such advantages rely on data proximity to the processing\nunits performing computations. Data movement overheads can degrade PIM's\nperformance and energy efficiency due to the need to move data between a\nprocessing unit and a distant memory location. %they face challenges due to the\noverhead of transferring data from remote memory locations to processing units\ninside memory for computation. In this paper, we demonstrate that a large\nfraction of PIM's latency per memory request is attributed to data transfers\nand queuing delays from remote memory accesses. To improve PIM's data locality,\nwe propose DL-PIM, a novel architecture that dynamically detects the overhead\nof data movement, and proactively moves data to a reserved area in the local\nmemory of the requesting processing unit. DL-PIM uses a distributed\naddress-indirection hardware lookup table to redirect traffic to the current\ndata location. We propose DL-PIM implementations on two 3D stacked memories:\nHMC and HBM. While some workloads benefit from DL-PIM, others are negatively\nimpacted by the additional latency due to indirection accesses. Therefore, we\npropose an adaptive mechanism that assesses the cost and benefit of indirection\nand dynamically enables or disables it to prevent degrading workloads that\nsuffer from indirection.

To address this limitation, we propose a modality-aware\ncooperative co-evolutionary algorithm for multimodal graph neural architecture\nsearch, termed MACC-MGNAS.

As a first step towards understanding\nthe role of dropout in large neural networks, we study the large-width\nasymptotics of gradient descent with dropout on two-layer neural networks with\nthe mean-field initialization scale. We obtain a rich asymptotic phase diagram\nthat exhibits five distinct nondegenerate phases depending on the relative\nmagnitudes of the dropout rate, the learning rate, and the width. Notably, we\nfind that the well-studied \"penalty\" effect of dropout only persists in the\nlimit with impractically small learning rates of order $O(1/\\text{width})$. For\nlarger learning rates, this effect disappears and in the limit, dropout is\nequivalent to a \"random geometry\" technique, where the gradients are thinned\nrandomly after the forward and backward pass have been computed. In this\nasymptotic regime, the limit is described by a mean-field jump process where\nthe neurons' update times follow independent Poisson or Bernoulli clocks\n(depending on whether the learning rate vanishes or not).

To close the gap\nbetween the intuition and the reality, we propose a novel sharpness measure,\ni.e., \\textit{R\\'enyi sharpness}, which is defined as the negative R\\'enyi\nentropy (a generalization of the classical Shannon entropy) of the loss\nHessian.

To rigorously establish the relationship between\ngeneralization and (R\\'enyi) sharpness, we provide several generalization\nbounds in terms of R\\'enyi sharpness, by taking advantage of the\nreparametrization invariance property of R\\'enyi sharpness, as well as the\ntrick of translating the data discrepancy to the weight perturbation.\nFurthermore, extensive experiments are conducted to verify the strong\ncorrelation (in specific, Kendall rank correlation) between the R\\'enyi\nsharpness and generalization.

Prior studies, including Ainsworth et al., have\nreported that achieving LMC requires not only an appropriate permutation search\nbut also sufficiently wide models (e.g., a 32 $\\times$ width multiplier for\nResNet-20).

This\nhas motivated growing interest in approximate unlearning, which aims to\nselectively remove unnecessary knowledge while preserving overall model\nperformance. Existing approaches to approximate unlearning have primarily\nfocused on class unlearning, where a VLM is retrained to fail to recognize\nspecified object classes while maintaining accuracy for others. However, merely\nforgetting object classes is often insufficient in practical applications. For\ninstance, an autonomous driving system should accurately recognize real cars\nwhile avoiding misrecognition of illustrated cars depicted in roadside\nadvertisements as real cars, which could be hazardous. In this paper, we\nintroduce Approximate Domain Unlearning (ADU), a novel problem setting that\nrequires reducing recognition accuracy for images from specified domains (e.g.,\nillustration) while preserving accuracy for other domains (e.g., real). ADU\npresents new technical challenges: due to the strong domain generalization\ncapability of pre-trained VLMs, domain distributions are highly entangled in\nthe feature space, making naive approaches based on penalizing target domains\nineffective. To tackle this limitation, we propose a novel approach that\nexplicitly disentangles domain distributions and adaptively captures\ninstance-specific domain information.

To\naddress this limitation, we propose Learning to Ask (LtA), a new framework that\nhandles both when and how to incorporate expert input in an ML model.

In this work, we present\na theoretical framework for policy optimization that guarantees convergence to\na particular optimal policy, via vanishing entropy regularization and a\ntemperature decoupling gambit. Our approach realizes an interpretable,\ndiversity-preserving optimal policy as the regularization temperature vanishes\nand ensures the convergence of policy derived objects--value functions and\nreturn distributions. In a particular instance of our method, for example, the\nrealized policy samples all optimal actions uniformly. Leveraging our\ntemperature decoupling gambit, we present an algorithm that estimates, to\narbitrary accuracy, the return distribution associated to its interpretable,\ndiversity-preserving optimal policy."}

However, a principled understanding of why it works has been\nlacking. This paper builds a theoretical foundation for RLVR by analyzing its\ntraining process at both the full-response (trajectory) and token levels.\nCentral to our analysis is a quantity called the Gradient Gap, which formalizes\nthe direction of improvement from low-reward to high-reward regions of the\nresponse space. We prove that convergence critically depends on aligning the\nupdate direction with this Gradient Gap. Moreover, we derive a sharp step-size\nthreshold based on the magnitude of the Gradient Gap: below it, learning\nconverges, whereas above it, performance collapses. Our theory further predicts\nhow the critical step size must scale with response length and the success\nrate, thereby explaining why practical heuristics such as length normalization\nimprove stability and showing that, with a fixed learning rate, the success\nrate can stagnate strictly below $100\\%$.

Pioneering work such as diffu-GRPO estimated token-level\nlikelihoods via one-step unmasking. While computationally efficient, this\napproach is severely biased. A more principled foundation lies in\nsequence-level likelihoods, where the evidence lower bound (ELBO) serves as a\nsurrogate.

However, linearity is defined\nrelative to a pair of vector spaces, $f$$:$$X$$\\to$$Y$. Is it possible to\nidentify a pair of non-standard vector spaces for which a conventionally\nnonlinear function is, in fact, linear? This paper introduces a method that\nmakes such vector spaces explicit by construction. We find that if we sandwich\na linear operator $A$ between two invertible neural networks, $f(x)=g_y^{-1}(A\ng_x(x))$, then the corresponding vector spaces $X$ and $Y$ are induced by newly\ndefined addition and scaling actions derived from $g_x$ and $g_y$. We term this\nkind of architecture a Linearizer. This framework makes the entire arsenal of\nlinear algebra, including SVD, pseudo-inverse, orthogonal projection and more,\napplicable to nonlinear mappings. Furthermore, we show that the composition of\ntwo Linearizers that share a neural network is also a Linearizer. We leverage\nthis property and demonstrate that training diffusion models using our\narchitecture makes the hundreds of sampling steps collapse into a single step.\nWe further utilize our framework to enforce idempotency (i.e. $f(f(x))=f(x)$)\non networks leading to a globally projective generative model and to\ndemonstrate modular style transfer."}

LLM inference is composed of two phases with\ndistinct characteristics: a compute-bound prefill phase followed by a\nmemory-bound decode phase. To efficiently serve LLMs, prior work proposes\nprefill-decode disaggregation to run each phase on separate hardware. However,\nexisting hardware poorly matches the different requirements of each phase.\nCurrent datacenter GPUs and TPUs follow a more-is-better design philosophy that\nmaximizes compute and memory resources, causing memory bandwidth\nunderutilization in the prefill phase and compute underutilization in the\ndecode phase. Such underutilization directly translates into increased serving\ncosts.\n  This paper proposes SPAD (Specialized Prefill and Decode hardware), adopting\na less-is-more methodology to design specialized chips tailored to the distinct\ncharacteristics of prefill and decode phases. The proposed Prefill Chips have\nlarger systolic arrays and use cost-effective GDDR memory, whereas the proposed\nDecode Chips retain high memory bandwidth but reduce compute capacity. Compared\nto modeled H100s, simulations show that the proposed Prefill Chips deliver 8%\nhigher prefill performance on average at 52% lower hardware cost, while the\nproposed Decode Chips achieve 97% of the decode performance with 28% lower TDP.\n  End-to-end simulations on production traces show that SPAD reduces hardware\ncost by 19%-41% and TDP by 2%-17% compared to modeled baseline clusters while\noffering the same performance. Even when models and workloads change, SPAD can\nreallocate either type of chip to run either phase and still achieve 11%-43%\nlower hardware costs, demonstrating the longevity of the SPAD design."}
