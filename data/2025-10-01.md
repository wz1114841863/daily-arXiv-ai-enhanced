### [1] [FlashOmni: A Unified Sparse Attention Engine for Diffusion Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25401)
*Liang Qiao,Yue Dai,Yeqi Huang,Hongyu Kan,Jun Shi,Hong An*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FlashOmni是一个统一的稀疏注意力引擎，兼容任意DiT架构，通过灵活稀疏符号标准化各种稀疏策略表示，在单个注意力内核中执行多样化稀疏计算，显著提升推理效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态扩散变换器(DiTs)在视觉合成中表现出色，但计算需求大限制了部署。现有稀疏加速方法需要定制化内核，缺乏通用性。

Method: 提出FlashOmni统一稀疏注意力引擎，引入灵活稀疏符号标准化稀疏策略表示，设计优化的稀疏GEMMs消除冗余计算。

Result: FlashOmni在注意力和GEMM-Q中实现接近线性加速(1:1)，在GEMM-O中实现2.5-3.8倍加速，达到理论极限的87.5%。应用多粒度稀疏策略使Hunyuan模型(33K)实现约1.5倍端到端加速且不降低视觉质量。

Conclusion: FlashOmni提供了一个通用高效的稀疏计算解决方案，显著提升DiT模型推理效率，为大规模视觉合成模型部署提供了实用工具。

Abstract: Multi-Modal Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) demonstrate exceptional
capabilities in visual synthesis, yet their deployment remains constrained by
substantial computational demands. To alleviate this bottleneck, many
sparsity-based acceleration methods have been proposed. However, their diverse
sparsity patterns often require customized kernels for high-performance
inference, limiting universality. We propose FlashOmni, a unified sparse
attention engine compatible with arbitrary DiT architectures. FlashOmni
introduces flexible sparse symbols to standardize the representation of a wide
range of sparsity strategies, such as feature caching and block-sparse
skipping. This unified abstraction enables the execution of diverse sparse
computations within a single attention kernel. In addition, FlashOmni designs
optimized sparse GEMMs for attention blocks, leveraging sparse symbols to
eliminate redundant computations and further improve efficiency. Experiments
demonstrate that FlashOmni delivers near-linear, closely matching the sparsity
ratio speedup (1:1) in attention and GEMM-$Q$, and achieves
2.5$\times$-3.8$\times$ acceleration in GEMM-$O$ (max peaking at about 87.5% of
the theoretical limit). Applied with a multi-granularity sparsity strategy, it
enables the Hunyuan model (33K) to achieve about 1.5$\times$ end-to-end
acceleration without degrading visual quality.

### [2] [Tuning the Tuner: Introducing Hyperparameter Optimization for Auto-Tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26300)
*Floris-Jan Willemsen,Rob V. van Nieuwpoort,Ben van Werkhoven*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种为自动调优框架优化算法进行超参数调优的新方法，通过统计评估、仿真模式和元策略显著提升自动调优性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动性能调优在科学计算领域广泛应用，但优化算法的超参数几乎从未被调优，其潜在性能影响未被充分研究。

Method: 提出通用超参数调优方法，包括跨搜索空间的统计性能评估、FAIR数据集发布、仿真模式重放历史调优数据以降低调优成本。

Result: 有限的超参数调优可使自动调优器性能平均提升94.8%，使用元策略优化超参数可平均提升204.7%。

Conclusion: 超参数调优是推进自动调优研究和实践的强大技术，常被忽视但潜力巨大。

Abstract: Automatic performance tuning (auto-tuning) is widely used to optimize
performance-critical applications across many scientific domains by finding the
best program variant among many choices. Efficient optimization algorithms are
crucial for navigating the vast and complex search spaces in auto-tuning. As is
well known in the context of machine learning and similar fields,
hyperparameters critically shape optimization algorithm efficiency. Yet for
auto-tuning frameworks, these hyperparameters are almost never tuned, and their
potential performance impact has not been studied.
  We present a novel method for general hyperparameter tuning of optimization
algorithms for auto-tuning, thus "tuning the tuner". In particular, we propose
a robust statistical method for evaluating hyperparameter performance across
search spaces, publish a FAIR data set and software for reproducibility, and
present a simulation mode that replays previously recorded tuning data,
lowering the costs of hyperparameter tuning by two orders of magnitude. We show
that even limited hyperparameter tuning can improve auto-tuner performance by
94.8% on average, and establish that the hyperparameters themselves can be
optimized efficiently with meta-strategies (with an average improvement of
204.7%), demonstrating the often overlooked hyperparameter tuning as a powerful
technique for advancing auto-tuning research and practice.

### [3] [SOLD: SELFIES-based Objective-driven Latent Diffusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25198)
*Elbert Ho*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了SOLD模型，一种基于SELFIES字符串的潜在扩散模型，用于生成针对目标蛋白的高亲和力分子，避免了直接在3D构象空间中生成的复杂性和低效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于目标蛋白生成分子的方法通常直接在3D构象空间中进行，这种方法速度慢且过于复杂，需要更简单高效的分子生成方法。

Method: 开发了SOLD模型，使用1D SELFIES字符串的潜在空间进行扩散建模，同时训练了创新的SELFIES变换器，并提出了多任务机器学习模型训练中的损失平衡新方法。

Result: 模型能够以简单高效的方式为目标蛋白生成高亲和力分子，并为通过添加更多数据进行未来改进留下了空间。

Conclusion: SOLD模型提供了一种新颖且有效的分子生成方法，在药物设计领域具有重要应用价值。

Abstract: Recently, machine learning has made a significant impact on de novo drug
design. However, current approaches to creating novel molecules conditioned on
a target protein typically rely on generating molecules directly in the 3D
conformational space, which are often slow and overly complex. In this work, we
propose SOLD (SELFIES-based Objective-driven Latent Diffusion), a novel latent
diffusion model that generates molecules in a latent space derived from 1D
SELFIES strings and conditioned on a target protein. In the process, we also
train an innovative SELFIES transformer and propose a new way to balance losses
when training multi-task machine learning models.Our model generates
high-affinity molecules for the target protein in a simple and efficient way,
while also leaving room for future improvements through the addition of more
data.

### [4] [VLHSA: Vision-Language Hierarchical Semantic Alignment for Jigsaw Puzzle Solving with Eroded Gaps](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25202)
*Zhuoning Xu,Xinyan Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合视觉和语言的多模态拼图求解框架，通过视觉-语言层次语义对齐模块提升拼图组装性能，在多个数据集上显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统拼图求解方法主要依赖视觉线索，但在具有侵蚀间隙的挑战性场景中，很少探索使用自然语言描述进行语义指导。

Method: 提出视觉-语言层次语义对齐(VLHSA)模块，通过多级语义匹配将视觉块与文本描述对齐，结合双视觉编码器和语言特征进行跨模态推理。

Result: 在多个数据集上显著优于最先进模型，拼片准确率提升14.2个百分点，消融研究证实VLHSA模块的关键作用。

Conclusion: 通过融入多模态语义洞察，为拼图求解建立了新范式。

Abstract: Jigsaw puzzle solving remains challenging in computer vision, requiring an
understanding of both local fragment details and global spatial relationships.
While most traditional approaches only focus on visual cues like edge matching
and visual coherence, few methods explore natural language descriptions for
semantic guidance in challenging scenarios, especially for eroded gap puzzles.
We propose a vision-language framework that leverages textual context to
enhance puzzle assembly performance. Our approach centers on the
Vision-Language Hierarchical Semantic Alignment (VLHSA) module, which aligns
visual patches with textual descriptions through multi-level semantic matching
from local tokens to global context. Also, a multimodal architecture that
combines dual visual encoders with language features for cross-modal reasoning
is integrated into this module. Experiments demonstrate that our method
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art models across various datasets,
achieving substantial improvements, including a 14.2 percentage point gain in
piece accuracy. Ablation studies confirm the critical role of the VLHSA module
in driving improvements over vision-only approaches. Our work establishes a new
paradigm for jigsaw puzzle solving by incorporating multimodal semantic
insights.

### [5] [Spectral Logit Sculpting: Adaptive Low-Rank Logit Transformation for Controlled Text Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25204)
*Jin Li,Zhebo Wang,Tianliang Lu,Mohan Li,Wenpeng Xing,Meng Han*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种轻量级的推理时优化方法Spectral Logit Sculpting (SLS)，通过利用最近logits的谱特性和熵特性来动态调整token分布，提高LLM的可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于熵的推理方法存在计算开销大且未能有效利用历史token上下文的问题，需要一种更高效的优化方法。

Method: SLS维护一个top-K logits的滑动缓冲区，进行实时奇异值分解识别主导谱方向，基于熵和logit间隙统计自适应地重新缩放logits，仅在高不确定性时激活。

Result: 在多个公共基准测试中，SLS始终优于现有基线方法，在数学、编程和科学推理任务中实现了更优的准确率。

Conclusion: SLS是一种无需更新模型参数的轻量级推理时优化方法，能有效锐化输出分布同时保持上下文一致性，显著提升LLM性能。

Abstract: Entropy-based inference methods have gained traction for improving the
reliability of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, many existing approaches,
such as entropy minimization techniques, suffer from high computational
overhead and fail to leverage historical token context effectively. To address
these limitations, we propose Spectral Logit Sculpting (SLS), a lightweight
inference-time optimization method that dynamically modulates token
distributions using spectral and entropic properties of recent logits. SLS
maintains a sliding buffer of top-K logits, performs on-the-fly Singular Value
Decomposition (SVD) to identify dominant spectral directions, and adaptively
rescales logits based on both entropy and logit gap statistics--only activating
when uncertainty is high. Without updating any model parameters, SLS
effectively sharpens the output distribution while preserving contextual
consistency. Experimental results on multiple public benchmarks demonstrate
that SLS consistently outperforms existing baseline methods, achieving superior
accuracy in mathematical, coding, and scientific reasoning tasks.

### [6] [Polynomial Contrastive Learning for Privacy-Preserving Representation Learning on Graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25205)
*Daksh Pandey*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了Poly-GRACE框架，这是首个与同态加密兼容的图自监督学习方法，解决了现有方法因依赖非线性操作而无法保护隐私的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的图自监督学习方法（如GRACE）由于依赖非线性操作，与同态加密等隐私保护技术不兼容，限制了在敏感图数据上的应用。

Method: 开发了完全多项式友好的图卷积网络编码器和基于多项式的对比损失函数，使整个框架能够在同态加密环境下运行。

Result: 在Cora、CiteSeer和PubMed三个基准数据集上的实验表明，Poly-GRACE不仅支持隐私预训练，而且在CiteSeer数据集上性能甚至优于标准非隐私基线方法。

Conclusion: 这项工作为实现实用且高性能的隐私保护图表示学习迈出了重要一步，为敏感图数据的自监督学习提供了可行的隐私保护解决方案。

Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for
learning representations on graph data without requiring manual labels.
However, leading SSL methods like GRACE are fundamentally incompatible with
privacy-preserving technologies such as Homomorphic Encryption (HE) due to
their reliance on non-polynomial operations. This paper introduces Poly-GRACE,
a novel framework for HE-compatible self-supervised learning on graphs. Our
approach consists of a fully polynomial-friendly Graph Convolutional Network
(GCN) encoder and a novel, polynomial-based contrastive loss function. Through
experiments on three benchmark datasets -- Cora, CiteSeer, and PubMed -- we
demonstrate that Poly-GRACE not only enables private pre-training but also
achieves performance that is highly competitive with, and in the case of
CiteSeer, superior to the standard non-private baseline. Our work represents a
significant step towards practical and high-performance privacy-preserving
graph representation learning.

### [7] [On the Shape of Latent Variables in a Denoising VAE-MoG: A Posterior Sampling-Based Study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25382)
*Fernanda Zapata Bascuñán*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文研究了在GW150914引力波数据上训练的变分自编码器-高斯混合模型（VAE-MoG）的潜在空间，发现尽管模型能准确重建信号，但潜在表示存在统计不匹配。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索生成模型的潜在空间可靠性，验证强去噪性能是否意味着可靠的潜在表示。

Method: 使用哈密顿蒙特卡洛（HMC）从干净输入中抽取后验样本，并与编码器从噪声数据输出的结果进行统计比较。

Result: 模型能准确重建信号，但潜在空间存在明显不匹配，表明去噪性能强不代表潜在表示可靠。

Conclusion: 在评估生成模型时，使用基于后验的验证方法至关重要。

Abstract: In this work, we explore the latent space of a denoising variational
autoencoder with a mixture-of-Gaussians prior (VAE-MoG), trained on
gravitational wave data from event GW150914. To evaluate how well the model
captures the underlying structure, we use Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) to draw
posterior samples conditioned on clean inputs, and compare them to the
encoder's outputs from noisy data. Although the model reconstructs signals
accurately, statistical comparisons reveal a clear mismatch in the latent
space. This shows that strong denoising performance doesn't necessarily mean
the latent representations are reliable highlighting the importance of using
posterior-based validation when evaluating generative models.

### [8] [Hyperbolic Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25206)
*Yanke Wang,Kyriakos Flouris*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了双曲Adam优化器，扩展了双曲随机梯度下降方法，特别适用于Poincaré球上的学习，并在扩散模型训练中展示了更快的收敛速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于黎曼优化原理，将双曲随机梯度下降扩展到双曲Adam优化器，旨在利用双曲几何的优势来加速训练收敛，特别是在参数远离最优解的早期训练阶段。

Method: 构建了双曲Adam优化器，作为黎曼SGD的特化版本，并结合双曲时间离散化的Langevin动力学来训练扩散模型。

Result: 在特定数据集上，使用双曲优化方法的扩散模型实现了更快的收敛速度，同时保持了生成质量。

Conclusion: 双曲优化方法在非欧几里得设置中具有优势，能够加速训练收敛，特别是在早期训练阶段，为学习Poincaré嵌入提供了有效途径。

Abstract: This work explores optimization methods on hyperbolic manifolds. Building on
Riemannian optimization principles, we extend the Hyperbolic Stochastic
Gradient Descent (a specialization of Riemannian SGD) to a Hyperbolic Adam
optimizer. While these methods are particularly relevant for learning on the
Poincar\'e ball, they may also provide benefits in Euclidean and other
non-Euclidean settings, as the chosen optimization encourages the learning of
Poincar\'e embeddings. This representation, in turn, accelerates convergence in
the early stages of training, when parameters are far from the optimum. As a
case study, we train diffusion models using the hyperbolic optimization methods
with hyperbolic time-discretization of the Langevin dynamics, and show that
they achieve faster convergence on certain datasets without sacrificing
generative quality.

### [9] [EEsizer: LLM-Based AI Agent for Sizing of Analog and Mixed Signal Circuit](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25510)
*Chang Liu,Danial Chitnis*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: EEsizer是一个基于大语言模型的AI代理，通过集成LLM与电路仿真器和数据分析功能，实现全自动、闭环的晶体管尺寸优化，无需外部知识。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 模拟和混合信号集成电路设计中的晶体管尺寸优化过程需要大量人工努力，现有机器学习方法仍面临迭代次数多和缺乏电路设计知识的挑战。

Method: 采用提示工程和思维链推理，让AI代理迭代探索设计方向、评估性能并优化解决方案，集成LLM与电路仿真器和自定义数据分析功能。

Result: 在8个LLM基准测试后，选择三个高性能模型优化20晶体管CMOS运算放大器，OpenAI o3在90nm节点成功实现用户目标，最多20次迭代。

Conclusion: EEsizer展示了在先进工艺节点上的适应性和鲁棒性，能够实现全自动晶体管尺寸优化。

Abstract: The design of Analog and Mixed-Signal (AMS) integrated circuits (ICs) often
involves significant manual effort, especially during the transistor sizing
process. While Machine Learning techniques in Electronic Design Automation
(EDA) have shown promise in reducing complexity and minimizing human
intervention, they still face challenges such as numerous iterations and a lack
of knowledge about AMS circuit design. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs)
have demonstrated significant potential across various fields, showing a
certain level of knowledge in circuit design and indicating their potential to
automate the transistor sizing process. In this work, we propose EEsizer, an
LLM-based AI agent that integrates large language models with circuit
simulators and custom data analysis functions, enabling fully automated,
closed-loop transistor sizing without relying on external knowledge. By
employing prompt engineering and Chain-of-Thought reasoning, the agent
iteratively explores design directions, evaluates performance, and refines
solutions with minimal human intervention. We first benchmarked 8 LLMs on six
basic circuits and selected three high-performing models to optimize a
20-transistor CMOS operational amplifier, targeting multiple performance
metrics, including rail-to-rail operation from 180 nm to 90 nm technology
nodes. Notably, OpenAI o3 successfully achieved the user-intended target at 90
nm across three different test groups, with a maximum of 20 iterations,
demonstrating adaptability and robustness at advanced nodes. To assess design
robustness, we manually designed a bias circuit and performed a variation
analysis using Gaussian-distributed variations on transistor dimensions and
threshold voltages.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一个多级诊断评估框架来评估LLM在特征工程中的鲁棒性，发现LLM生成的优质特征可将少样本预测性能提升高达10.52%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管LLM在表格数据特征工程中显示出潜力，但由于生成输出的可变性，对其可靠性的担忧仍然存在。

Method: 引入多级诊断和评估框架，关注三个主要因素：关键变量、关系和预测目标类的决策边界值。

Result: LLM的鲁棒性在不同数据集间差异显著，高质量LLM生成特征可将少样本预测性能提升高达10.52%。

Conclusion: 这项工作为评估和增强LLM驱动特征工程在各领域的可靠性开辟了新方向。

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in
feature engineering for tabular data, but concerns about their reliability
persist, especially due to variability in generated outputs. We introduce a
multi-level diagnosis and evaluation framework to assess the robustness of LLMs
in feature engineering across diverse domains, focusing on the three main
factors: key variables, relationships, and decision boundary values for
predicting target classes. We demonstrate that the robustness of LLMs varies
significantly over different datasets, and that high-quality LLM-generated
features can improve few-shot prediction performance by up to 10.52%. This work
opens a new direction for assessing and enhancing the reliability of LLM-driven
feature engineering in various domains.

### [11] [DPSformer: A long-tail-aware model for improving heavy rainfall prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25208)
*Zenghui Huang,Ting Shu,Zhonglei Wang,Yang Lu,Yan Yan,Wei Zhong,Hanzi Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DPSformer是一个针对强降雨预测的长尾学习模型，通过高分辨率分支增强对罕见强降雨事件的表征，显著提升了强降雨预测的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 强降雨预测对社会至关重要，但降水数据分布高度不平衡——大多数观测记录无雨或小雨，而强降雨事件罕见。这种不平衡分布阻碍深度学习模型有效预测强降雨事件。

Method: 将降雨预测明确视为长尾学习问题，引入DPSformer模型，通过高分辨率分支丰富强降雨事件的表征。

Result: 对于≥50mm/6h的强降雨事件，DPSformer将基准数值天气预报模型的CSI从0.012提升到0.067；对于前1%的强降雨事件，其FSS超过0.45，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 这项工作为强降雨预测建立了有效的长尾范式，为增强预警系统和减轻极端天气事件的社会影响提供了实用工具。

Abstract: Accurate and timely forecasting of heavy rainfall remains a critical
challenge for modern society. Precipitation exhibits a highly imbalanced
distribution: most observations record no or light rain, while heavy rainfall
events are rare. Such an imbalanced distribution obstructs deep learning models
from effectively predicting heavy rainfall events. To address this challenge,
we treat rainfall forecasting explicitly as a long-tailed learning problem,
identifying the insufficient representation of heavy rainfall events as the
primary barrier to forecasting accuracy. Therefore, we introduce DPSformer, a
long-tail-aware model that enriches representation of heavy rainfall events
through a high-resolution branch. For heavy rainfall events $ \geq $ 50 mm/6 h,
DPSformer lifts the Critical Success Index (CSI) of a baseline Numerical
Weather Prediction (NWP) model from 0.012 to 0.067. For the top 1% coverage of
heavy rainfall events, its Fraction Skill Score (FSS) exceeds 0.45, surpassing
existing methods. Our work establishes an effective long-tailed paradigm for
heavy rainfall prediction, offering a practical tool to enhance early warning
systems and mitigate the societal impacts of extreme weather events.

### [12] [STCast: Adaptive Boundary Alignment for Global and Regional Weather Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25210)
*Hao Chen,Tao Han,Jie Zhang,Song Guo,Lei Bai*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: STCast是一个AI驱动的时空天气预测框架，通过自适应区域边界优化和动态月度预测分配，在全局和区域预测、极端事件预测和集合预测任务中优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有区域预测方法受限于静态和不精确的区域边界，导致泛化能力差。需要解决边界约束问题以提升区域预测效果。

Method: 提出空间对齐注意力机制(SAA)来对齐全局和区域空间分布以初始化边界，并基于注意力模式自适应优化边界；设计时间混合专家模块(TMoE)，使用离散高斯分布将不同月份的大气变量动态路由到专门专家，增强时间模式捕捉能力。

Result: 实验结果表明，在全局预测、区域预测、极端事件预测和集合预测四个任务中，STCast均优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: STCast通过自适应边界优化和动态专家分配，有效提升了天气预测的准确性和泛化能力，在多个预测任务中表现出色。

Abstract: To gain finer regional forecasts, many works have explored the regional
integration from the global atmosphere, e.g., by solving boundary equations in
physics-based methods or cropping regions from global forecasts in data-driven
methods. However, the effectiveness of these methods is often constrained by
static and imprecise regional boundaries, resulting in poor generalization
ability. To address this issue, we propose Spatial-Temporal Weather Forecasting
(STCast), a novel AI-driven framework for adaptive regional boundary
optimization and dynamic monthly forecast allocation. Specifically, our
approach employs a Spatial-Aligned Attention (SAA) mechanism, which aligns
global and regional spatial distributions to initialize boundaries and
adaptively refines them based on attention-derived alignment patterns.
Furthermore, we design a Temporal Mixture-of-Experts (TMoE) module, where
atmospheric variables from distinct months are dynamically routed to
specialized experts using a discrete Gaussian distribution, enhancing the
model's ability to capture temporal patterns. Beyond global and regional
forecasting, we evaluate our STCast on extreme event prediction and ensemble
forecasting. Experimental results demonstrate consistent superiority over
state-of-the-art methods across all four tasks.

### [13] [LEMs: A Primer On Large Execution Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25211)
*Remi Genet,Hugo Inzirillo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LEMs是一种基于Transformer的深度学习框架，用于处理具有灵活时间边界和多约束的复杂执行问题，通过分离市场信息处理和分配决策来实现统一模型架构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统执行策略局限于固定时间范围，无法处理类似股票回购合约的灵活时间边界场景，需要一种能适应不同执行目标和约束的统一框架。

Method: 使用TKANs、VSNs和多头注意力机制处理市场数据，独立分配网络处理不同执行逻辑，实现市场信息处理与执行决策的解耦。

Result: 在加密货币日内交易和道琼斯成分股多日交易中，LEMs相比传统基准实现了更优的执行性能，能在灵活时间约束内动态优化执行路径。

Conclusion: LEMs提供了一种统一框架，能部署于不同执行场景（买卖订单、不同时间边界、数量/名义目标），相比资产特定方法具有显著操作优势。

Abstract: This paper introduces Large Execution Models (LEMs), a novel deep learning
framework that extends transformer-based architectures to address complex
execution problems with flexible time boundaries and multiple execution
constraints. Building upon recent advances in neural VWAP execution strategies,
LEMs generalize the approach from fixed-duration orders to scenarios where
execution duration is bounded between minimum and maximum time horizons,
similar to share buyback contract structures. The proposed architecture
decouples market information processing from execution allocation decisions: a
common feature extraction pipeline using Temporal Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks
(TKANs), Variable Selection Networks (VSNs), and multi-head attention
mechanisms processes market data to create informational context, while
independent allocation networks handle the specific execution logic for
different scenarios (fixed quantity vs. fixed notional, buy vs. sell orders).
This architectural separation enables a unified model to handle diverse
execution objectives while leveraging shared market understanding across
scenarios. Through comprehensive empirical evaluation on intraday
cryptocurrency markets and multi-day equity trading using DOW Jones
constituents, we demonstrate that LEMs achieve superior execution performance
compared to traditional benchmarks by dynamically optimizing execution paths
within flexible time constraints. The unified model architecture enables
deployment across different execution scenarios (buy/sell orders, varying
duration boundaries, volume/notional targets) through a single framework,
providing significant operational advantages over asset-specific approaches.

TL;DR: 该研究应用田口实验设计方法优化CNN超参数，用于职业拳击动作识别。通过L12正交阵列评估8个超参数，开发了5种多目标优化方法，其中方法3表现最佳，达到98.84%训练准确率和86.25%验证准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CNN超参数优化过程具有挑战性且计算成本高，通常需要大量试错或穷举搜索。传统质量工程中的田口实验设计方法可以系统性地解决这个问题。

Method: 使用L12(211)正交阵列系统评估8个超参数，包括图像尺寸、颜色模式、激活函数、学习率等。开发了5种多目标优化方法，结合信噪比分析，并采用对数缩放技术统一冲突指标。

Result: 方法3（结合加权准确率指标和对数变换损失函数）表现最优：训练准确率98.84%，验证准确率86.25%，同时保持最小损失值。学习率是最关键参数，其次是图像尺寸和激活函数。

Conclusion: 田口实验设计方法能有效优化CNN超参数，提供清晰的参数优先级指导，学习率是最重要的影响因素。该方法为机器学习优化提供了系统化的解决方案。

Abstract: The optimization of hyperparameters in convolutional neural networks (CNNs)
remains a challenging and computationally expensive process, often requiring
extensive trial-and-error approaches or exhaustive grid searches. This study
introduces the application of Taguchi Design of Experiments methodology, a
statistical optimization technique traditionally used in quality engineering,
to systematically optimize CNN hyperparameters for professional boxing action
recognition. Using an L12(211) orthogonal array, eight hyperparameters
including image size, color mode, activation function, learning rate,
rescaling, shuffling, vertical flip, and horizontal flip were systematically
evaluated across twelve experimental configurations. To address the
multi-objective nature of machine learning optimization, five different
approaches were developed to simultaneously optimize training accuracy,
validation accuracy, training loss, and validation loss using Signal-to-Noise
ratio analysis. The study employed a novel logarithmic scaling technique to
unify conflicting metrics and enable comprehensive multi-quality assessment
within the Taguchi framework. Results demonstrate that Approach 3, combining
weighted accuracy metrics with logarithmically transformed loss functions,
achieved optimal performance with 98.84% training accuracy and 86.25%
validation accuracy while maintaining minimal loss values. The Taguchi analysis
revealed that learning rate emerged as the most influential parameter, followed
by image size and activation function, providing clear guidance for
hyperparameter prioritization in CNN optimization.

*Rongguang Ye,Ming Tang,Edith C. H. Ngai*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CoA-LoRA是一种动态调整LoRA适配器以适应任意量化配置的方法，无需重复微调，通过配置感知模型将每个配置映射到其低秩调整。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大型预训练模型的发布，在边缘设备上部署需要有效的压缩。现有方法为每个量化配置单独微调高精度LoRA适配器计算成本过高，且边缘设备能力异构。

Method: 提出配置感知模型，将任意量化配置映射到低秩调整；设计基于Pareto的配置搜索算法，迭代优化训练配置集以覆盖不同总比特宽度预算。

Result: 实验表明，CoA-LoRA无需额外时间成本，就能达到与需要为每个配置单独微调LoRA适配器的最先进方法相当甚至更优的性能。

Conclusion: CoA-LoRA能够动态适应任意量化配置，解决了边缘设备部署中的异构能力和计算成本问题，实现了高效的模型压缩。

Abstract: As increasingly large pre-trained models are released, deploying them on edge
devices for privacy-preserving applications requires effective compression.
Recent works combine quantization with the fine-tuning of high-precision LoRA
adapters, which can substantially reduce model size while mitigating the
accuracy loss from quantization. However, edge devices have inherently
heterogeneous capabilities, while performing configuration-wise fine-tuning for
every quantization setting is computationally prohibitive. In this paper, we
propose CoA-LoRA, a method that dynamically adjusts the LoRA adapter to
arbitrary quantization configurations (i.e., the per-layer bit-width choices of
a pre-trained model) without requiring repeated fine-tuning. This is
accomplished via a configuration-aware model that maps each configuration to
its low-rank adjustments. The effectiveness of this model critically depends on
the training configuration set, a collection of configurations chosen to cover
different total bit-width budgets. However, constructing a high-quality
configuration set is non-trivial. We therefore design a Pareto-based
configuration search that iteratively optimizes the training configuration set,
yielding more precise low-rank adjustments. Our experiments demonstrate that,
unlike the state-of-the-art methods that require fine-tuning a separate LoRA
adapter for each configuration, CoA-LoRA incurs no additional time cost while
achieving comparable or even superior performance to those methods.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出PARADISE方法，一种基于分区的无监督异常检测方法，用于多元时间序列异常检测，通过变量聚类保持变量间关系，在局部子集执行异常检测算法


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多元时间序列异常检测中变量间关系复杂的问题，通过分区方法保持变量间关系同时提高检测性能

Method: 基于变量间多重相关系数聚类创建分区，确保变量间关系不变，然后在每个子集局部执行异常检测算法

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上的实验表明，该方法显著提高了异常检测性能

Conclusion: PARADISE方法通过分区策略有效提升了多元时间序列异常检测的效果

Abstract: In this article, we suggest a novel non-supervised partition based anomaly
detection method for anomaly detection in multivariate time series called
PARADISE. This methodology creates a partition of the variables of the time
series while ensuring that the inter-variable relations remain untouched. This
partitioning relies on the clustering of multiple correlation coefficients
between variables to identify subsets of variables before executing anomaly
detection algorithms locally for each of those subsets. Through multiple
experimentations done on both synthetic and real datasets coming from the
literature, we show the relevance of our approach with a significant
improvement in anomaly detection performance.

*Guillermo Comesaña Cimadevila*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文重新审视了机器学习中的双下降现象，通过在结核病耐药性预测任务中系统研究模型复杂性，发现双下降仅在同时调节学习器能力和集成规模两个维度时出现，支持展开假说。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统学习理论描述模型复杂度与预测误差的U形关系，但近期研究发现双下降现象。虽然双下降在深度学习中广泛研究，但在决策树等简单模型中也存在。本研究旨在通过生物分类任务重新验证这些发现。

Method: 使用全基因组测序数据预测结核分枝杆菌异烟肼耐药性，系统调节模型复杂度的两个正交维度：学习器能力（如Pleaf、Pboost）和集成规模（Pens），分析泛化行为。

Result: 双下降仅在同时调节两个复杂度维度时一致出现。当任一维度固定时，泛化行为回归到经典的U形或L形模式。这些结果在合成基准测试中得到复现。

Conclusion: 研究结果支持展开假说，表明双下降源于不同泛化机制在单一复杂度轴上的投影。强调在分析泛化行为时，应将模型复杂度视为多维结构。

Abstract: Classical learning theory describes a well-characterised U-shaped
relationship between model complexity and prediction error, reflecting a
transition from underfitting in underparameterised regimes to overfitting as
complexity grows. Recent work, however, has introduced the notion of a second
descent in test error beyond the interpolation threshold-giving rise to the
so-called double descent phenomenon. While double descent has been studied
extensively in the context of deep learning, it has also been reported in
simpler models, including decision trees and gradient boosting. In this work,
we revisit these claims through the lens of classical machine learning applied
to a biological classification task: predicting isoniazid resistance in
Mycobacterium tuberculosis using whole-genome sequencing data. We
systematically vary model complexity along two orthogonal axes-learner capacity
(e.g., Pleaf, Pboost) and ensemble size (i.e., Pens)-and show that double
descent consistently emerges only when complexity is scaled jointly across
these axes. When either axis is held fixed, generalisation behaviour reverts to
classical U- or L-shaped patterns. These results are replicated on a synthetic
benchmark and support the unfolding hypothesis, which attributes double descent
to the projection of distinct generalisation regimes onto a single complexity
axis. Our findings underscore the importance of treating model complexity as a
multidimensional construct when analysing generalisation behaviour. All code

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TASP是一种针对长上下文LLM的拓扑感知序列并行方法，通过拓扑分解和原语分解充分利用现代加速器的通信能力，相比Ring Attention实现了高达3.58倍的加速。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 主流序列并行方法Ring Attention由于采用Ring AllGather通信原语，与现代加速器的AlltoAll拓扑不匹配，导致通信效率低下，限制了实际应用。

Method: 基于哈密顿分解理论，将现代加速器拓扑分解为多个正交环形数据路径，同时将Ring AllGather原语分解为相同数量的并发环形数据传输，提出TASP方法。

Result: 在单节点和多节点NVIDIA H100系统以及单节点AMD MI300X系统上的实验表明，TASP比Ring Attention及其变种Zigzag-Ring Attention实现了更高的通信效率，最高可达3.58倍加速。

Conclusion: TASP通过拓扑感知的序列并行方法有效解决了长上下文LLM中的通信瓶颈问题，显著提升了训练效率。

Abstract: Long-context large language models (LLMs) face constraints due to the
quadratic complexity of the self-attention mechanism. The mainstream sequence
parallelism (SP) method, Ring Attention, attempts to solve this by distributing
the query into multiple query chunks across accelerators and enable each Q
tensor to access all KV tensors from other accelerators via the Ring AllGather
communication primitive. However, it exhibits low communication efficiency,
restricting its practical applicability. This inefficiency stems from the
mismatch between the Ring AllGather communication primitive it adopts and the
AlltoAll topology of modern accelerators. A Ring AllGather primitive is
composed of iterations of ring-styled data transfer, which can only utilize a
very limited fraction of an AlltoAll topology.
  Inspired by the Hamiltonian decomposition of complete directed graphs, we
identify that modern accelerator topology can be decomposed into multiple
orthogonal ring datapaths which can concurrently transfer data without
interference. Based on this, we further observe that the Ring AllGather
primitive can also be decomposed into the same number of concurrent ring-styled
data transfer at every iteration. Based on these insights, we propose TASP, a
topology-aware SP method for long-context LLMs that fully utilizes the
communication capacity of modern accelerators via topology decomposition and
primitive decomposition. Experimental results on both single-node and
multi-node NVIDIA H100 systems and a single-node AMD MI300X system demonstrate
that TASP achieves higher communication efficiency than Ring Attention on these
modern accelerator topologies and achieves up to 3.58 speedup than Ring
Attention and its variant Zigzag-Ring Attention. The code is available at

TL;DR: L2C是一个可扩展的数据驱动框架，通过训练神经网络来评分变量赋值，加速概率图模型中最可能解释推理，显著减少搜索空间并保持或提高解质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决概率图模型中最可能解释推理这一根本难解问题，传统方法计算成本高，需要更高效的推理加速方法。

Method: 训练神经网络评估变量赋值对条件化的效用，利用现有MPE求解器的搜索轨迹生成训练数据，将训练好的网络作为启发式与搜索算法集成。

Result: 在高树宽概率图模型的挑战性MPE查询上，学习到的启发式显著减少搜索空间，同时保持或优于最先进方法的解质量。

Conclusion: L2C框架成功展示了数据驱动方法在加速难解推理问题上的有效性，为概率图模型推理提供了新的可扩展解决方案。

Abstract: We introduce learning to condition (L2C), a scalable, data-driven framework
for accelerating Most Probable Explanation (MPE) inference in Probabilistic
Graphical Models (PGMs), a fundamentally intractable problem. L2C trains a
neural network to score variable-value assignments based on their utility for
conditioning, given observed evidence. To facilitate supervised learning, we
develop a scalable data generation pipeline that extracts training signals from
the search traces of existing MPE solvers. The trained network serves as a
heuristic that integrates with search algorithms, acting as a conditioning
strategy prior to exact inference or as a branching and node selection policy
within branch-and-bound solvers. We evaluate L2C on challenging MPE queries
involving high-treewidth PGMs. Experiments show that our learned heuristic
significantly reduces the search space while maintaining or improving solution
quality over state-of-the-art methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: TinyML技术在计算、内存和能量方面的特定约束需要专门的优化技术，而深度神经网络在TinyML中广泛应用，探索动态集成选择方法也很有益。

Method: 采用动态集成选择聚类方法，实现了针对嵌入式系统限制优化的TinyDES-Clustering库。

Result: 实验表明，用于动态选择的更大分类器池可以提高分类精度，但会导致TinyML设备上平均推理时间的增加。

Conclusion: 动态集成选择聚类方法能够在TinyML系统中有效平衡分类精度与推理性能，但需要在准确性和延迟之间进行权衡。

Abstract: The recent progress in TinyML technologies triggers the need to address the
challenge of balancing inference time and classification quality. TinyML
systems are defined by specific constraints in computation, memory and energy.
These constraints emphasize the need for specialized optimization techniques
when implementing Machine Learning (ML) applications on such platforms. While
deep neural networks are widely used in TinyML, the exploration of Dynamic
Ensemble Selection (DES) methods is also beneficial. This study examines a
DES-Clustering approach for a multi-class computer vision task within TinyML
systems. This method allows for adjusting classification accuracy, thereby
affecting latency and energy consumption per inference. We implemented the
TinyDES-Clustering library, optimized for embedded system limitations.
Experiments have shown that a larger pool of classifiers for dynamic selection
improves classification accuracy, and thus leads to an increase in average
inference time on the TinyML device.

Conclusion: 该框架为城市尺度流场估计和天气输入集成提供了基础，具有广泛的适应性和应用前景。

Abstract: We propose a physics-informed machine-learned framework for sensor-based flow
estimation for drone trajectories in complex urban terrain. The input is a rich
set of flow simulations at many wind conditions. The outputs are velocity and
uncertainty estimates for a target domain and subsequent sensor optimization
for minimal uncertainty. The framework has three innovations compared to
traditional flow estimators. First, the algorithm scales proportionally to the
domain complexity, making it suitable for flows that are too complex for any
monolithic reduced-order representation. Second, the framework extrapolates
beyond the training data, e.g., smaller and larger wind velocities. Last, and
perhaps most importantly, the sensor location is a free input, significantly
extending the vast majority of the literature. The key enablers are (1) a
Reynolds number-based scaling of the flow variables, (2) a physics-based domain
decomposition, (3) a cluster-based flow representation for each subdomain, (4)
an information entropy correlating the subdomains, and (5) a multi-variate
probability function relating sensor input and targeted velocity estimates.
This framework is demonstrated using drone flight paths through a
three-building cluster as a simple example. We anticipate adaptations and
applications for estimating complete cities and incorporating weather input.

TL;DR: 提出了Residual Linear Attention (RLA)框架，通过显式残差拟合机制解决线性注意力在捕获长程模式时的表达能力瓶颈问题，并实例化了Residual Delta Net (RDN)版本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 线性注意力虽然提供线性时间替代方案，但在捕获长程模式方面表现不佳，现有变体存在表达能力瓶颈。

Method: 通过预测-校正视角重新审视线性注意力，引入辅助循环状态来累积残差误差并校正基础预测，RDN版本还包含自适应门控和残差裁剪。

Result: 在语言建模和召回密集型评估中，RLA和RDN始终优于各自基线和现代线性注意力方法，缩小了与标准Transformer的差距同时保持线性扩展。

Conclusion: RLA框架有效解决了线性注意力的表达能力瓶颈，在保持线性计算复杂度的同时显著提升了性能。

Abstract: Linear attention offers a linear-time alternative to self-attention but often
struggles to capture long-range patterns. We revisit linear attention through a
prediction-correction lens and show that prevalent variants can be written as a
combination of a historical prediction and a single-token correction, which
creates an expressivity bottleneck. To address this bottleneck, we introduce
Residual Linear Attention (RLA), a framework that equips linear attention with
an explicit residual-fitting mechanism. RLA maintains an auxiliary recurrent
state that learns to accumulate residual errors over time and correct the base
prediction. We further instantiate a delta-rule version, Residual Delta Net
(RDN), incorporating adaptive gating and residual clipping for enhanced
correction control and stability. Our implementation leverages highly optimized
linear attention kernels and preserves linear time and memory. Across language
modeling and recall-intensive evaluations, RLA and RDN consistently outperform
their respective baselines and other modern linear-attention methods, narrowing
the gap to standard Transformers while retaining linear scaling.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多头潜在注意力(MLA)虽然减少了KVCache内存使用，但带来了计算开销和中间变量扩展的问题，这对硬件实现特别是在解码阶段提出了挑战。

Method: 1. 基于FlashAttention的新算法，用整数加法替代浮点乘法进行输出块重缩放；2. 采用预加载流水线策略和分层分块，最大化FLOPS利用率。

Result: 在昇腾910 NPU上达到614 TFLOPS，达到理论最大FLOPS的86.8%，优于开源FlashMLA实现（在NVIDIA H800上最高66.7%利用率）。

Conclusion: AMLA内核已集成到华为CANN中，将很快发布，为MLA在昇腾NPU上的高效实现提供了解决方案。

Abstract: Multi-head Latent Attention (MLA) significantly reduces KVCache memory usage
in Large Language Models while introducing substantial computational overhead
and intermediate variable expansion. This poses challenges for efficient
hardware implementation -- especially during the decode phase. This paper
introduces Ascend MLA (AMLA), a high-performance kernel specifically optimized
for Huawei's Ascend NPUs. AMLA is built on two core innovations: (1) A novel
FlashAttention-based algorithm that replaces floating-point multiplications
with integer additions for output block rescaling, leveraging binary
correspondence between FP32 and INT32 representations; (2) A Preload Pipeline
strategy with hierarchical tiling that maximizes FLOPS utilization: the Preload
Pipeline achieves Cube-bound performance, while hierarchical tiling overlaps
data movement and computation within the Cube core. Experiments show that on
Ascend 910 NPUs (integrated in CloudMatrix384), AMLA achieves up to 614 TFLOPS,
reaching 86.8% of the theoretical maximum FLOPS, outperforming the
state-of-the-art open-source FlashMLA implementation, whose FLOPS utilization
is up to 66.7% on NVIDIA H800 SXM5. The AMLA kernel has been integrated into
Huawei's CANN and will be released soon.

Motivation: 当前结构药物设计方法难以捕捉蛋白质-配体相互作用的多尺度复杂性和内在不对称性，限制了药物设计的准确性。

Method: 提出MSCoD框架，包含多尺度信息瓶颈(MSIB)进行分层特征提取，以及多头协作注意力(MHCA)机制处理蛋白质与配体之间的维度差异和不对称相互作用。

Result: 在基准数据集上MSCoD优于现有最先进方法，在KRAS G12D等挑战性靶点的案例研究中证明了其实际应用价值。

Conclusion: MSCoD通过多尺度特征提取和不对称注意力机制，有效提升了结构药物设计的性能，为复杂靶点的药物发现提供了有力工具。

Abstract: Structure-Based Drug Design (SBDD) is a powerful strategy in computational
drug discovery, utilizing three-dimensional protein structures to guide the
design of molecules with improved binding affinity. However, capturing complex
protein-ligand interactions across multiple scales remains challenging, as
current methods often overlook the hierarchical organization and intrinsic
asymmetry of these interactions. To address these limitations, we propose
MSCoD, a novel Bayesian updating-based generative framework for structure-based
drug design. In our MSCoD, Multi-Scale Information Bottleneck (MSIB) was
developed, which enables semantic compression at multiple abstraction levels
for efficient hierarchical feature extraction. Furthermore, a multi-head
cooperative attention (MHCA) mechanism was developed, which employs asymmetric
protein-to-ligand attention to capture diverse interaction types while
addressing the dimensionality disparity between proteins and ligands. Empirical
studies showed that MSCoD outperforms state-of-the-art methods on the benchmark
dataset. Case studies on challenging targets such as KRAS G12D further
demonstrate its applicability in real-world scenarios. The code and data

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的预测方法多为单能源独立建模，未能充分考虑多能源间的复杂耦合关系，且难以捕捉系统的非线性和非平稳动态特性，限制了预测性能和实用性。

Method: 使用MVMD联合分解风、光、波功率序列以保持跨源耦合关系；采用贝叶斯优化自动搜索MVMD中的模态数量和惩罚参数；最后用LSTM对得到的本征模态函数进行建模预测。

Conclusion: 所提框架在预测精度、鲁棒性和自动化程度方面表现出优越性能，为集成海洋能源系统的安全运行和优化调度提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Integrated wind-solar-wave marine energy systems hold broad promise for
supplying clean electricity in offshore and coastal regions. By leveraging the
spatiotemporal complementarity of multiple resources, such systems can
effectively mitigate the intermittency and volatility of single-source outputs,
thereby substantially improving overall power-generation efficiency and
resource utilization. Accurate ultra-short-term forecasting is crucial for
ensuring secure operation and optimizing proactive dispatch. However, most
existing forecasting methods construct separate models for each energy source,
insufficiently account for the complex couplings among multiple energies,
struggle to capture the system's nonlinear and nonstationary dynamics, and
typically depend on extensive manual parameter tuning-limitations that
constrain both predictive performance and practicality. We address this issue
using a Bayesian-optimized Multivariate Variational Mode Decomposition-Long
Short-Term Memory (MVMD-LSTM) framework. The framework first applies MVMD to
jointly decompose wind, solar and wave power series so as to preserve
cross-source couplings; it uses Bayesian optimization to automatically search
the number of modes and the penalty parameter in the MVMD process to obtain
intrinsic mode functions (IMFs); finally, an LSTM models the resulting IMFs to
achieve ultra-short-term power forecasting for the integrated system.
Experiments based on field measurements from an offshore integrated energy
platform in China show that the proposed framework significantly outperforms
benchmark models in terms of MAPE, RMSE and MAE. The results demonstrate
superior predictive accuracy, robustness, and degree of automation.

Conclusion: RPFs是即插即用、高效且理论严谨的注入式归一化流框架，在生成建模中表现出色，连接了随机投影理论与归一化流领域。

Abstract: We introduce Random Projection Flows (RPFs), a principled framework for
injective normalizing flows that leverages tools from random matrix theory and
the geometry of random projections. RPFs employ random semi-orthogonal
matrices, drawn from Haar-distributed orthogonal ensembles via QR decomposition
of Gaussian matrices, to project data into lower-dimensional latent spaces for
the base distribution. Unlike PCA-based flows or learned injective maps, RPFs
are plug-and-play, efficient, and yield closed-form expressions for the
Riemannian volume correction term. We demonstrate that RPFs are both
theoretically grounded and practically effective, providing a strong baseline
for generative modeling and a bridge between random projection theory and
normalizing flows.

Conclusion: 通过学习度量张量来准确捕捉数据几何结构，可以有效改进流匹配方法，克服传统方法在高维空间中的局限性。

Abstract: A useful inductive bias for temporal data is that trajectories should stay
close to the data manifold. Traditional flow matching relies on straight
conditional paths, and flow matching methods which learn geodesics rely on RBF
kernels or nearest neighbor graphs that suffer from the curse of
dimensionality. We propose to use score matching and annealed energy
distillation to learn a metric tensor that faithfully captures the underlying
data geometry and informs more accurate flows. We demonstrate the efficacy of
this strategy on synthetic manifolds with analytic geodesics, and interpolation
of cell

Motivation: 时间序列数据稀疏性导致仅依赖时域或频域建模无法充分利用多域信息，传统注意力机制在时间序列预测中容易过度关注无关历史信息，引入噪声导致预测偏差。

Method: 使用小波变换对时间序列进行多分辨率分析，利用时频域联合表示优势提取关键信息；在倒置维度上应用注意力机制捕捉多变量关系；引入差分注意力机制，通过两个独立softmax注意力矩阵的差异计算注意力分数。

Result: WDformer在多个具有挑战性的真实世界数据集上取得了最先进（SOTA）的结果，证明了其准确性和有效性。

Conclusion: WDformer通过小波变换和差分注意力机制有效解决了时间序列预测中的多域信息利用和噪声问题，在多个应用场景中表现出色。

Abstract: Time series forecasting has various applications, such as meteorological
rainfall prediction, traffic flow analysis, financial forecasting, and
operational load monitoring for various systems. Due to the sparsity of time
series data, relying solely on time-domain or frequency-domain modeling limits
the model's ability to fully leverage multi-domain information. Moreover, when
applied to time series forecasting tasks, traditional attention mechanisms tend
to over-focus on irrelevant historical information, which may introduce noise
into the prediction process, leading to biased results. We proposed WDformer, a
wavelet-based differential Transformer model. This study employs the wavelet
transform to conduct a multi-resolution analysis of time series data. By
leveraging the advantages of joint representation in the time-frequency domain,
it accurately extracts the key information components that reflect the
essential characteristics of the data. Furthermore, we apply attention
mechanisms on inverted dimensions, allowing the attention mechanism to capture
relationships between multiple variables. When performing attention
calculations, we introduced the differential attention mechanism, which
computes the attention score by taking the difference between two separate
softmax attention matrices. This approach enables the model to focus more on
important information and reduce noise. WDformer has achieved state-of-the-art
(SOTA) results on multiple challenging real-world datasets, demonstrating its
accuracy and effectiveness. Code is available at

Conclusion: GMA采样器提供了一种梯度无关、计算高效的采样框架，能够从非归一化目标密度中生成忠实样本，具有理论一致性和实际有效性。

Abstract: We present a family of \textit{Gaussian Mixture Approximation} (GMA) samplers
for sampling unnormalised target densities, encompassing \textit{weights-only
GMA} (W-GMA), \textit{Laplace Mixture Approximation} (LMA),
\textit{expectation-maximization GMA} (EM-GMA), and further variants. GMA
adopts a simple two-stage paradigm: (i) initialise a finite set of Gaussian
components and draw samples from a proposal mixture; (ii) fit the mixture to
the target by optimising either only the component weights or also the means
and variances, via a sample-based KL divergence objective that requires only
evaluations of the unnormalised density, followed by stratified resampling. The
method is gradient-free, and computationally efficient: it leverages the ease
of sampling from Gaussians, efficient optimisation methods (projected gradient
descent, mirror descent, and EM), and the robustness of stratified resampling
to produce samples faithful to the target. We show that this
optimisation-resampling scheme yields consistent approximations under mild
conditions, and we validate this methodology with empirical results

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦学习在车联网等动态异构环境中面临数据异构性和设备异构性的挑战，需要提高模型精度和资源效率

Method: FedCLF引入校准损失作为参与者选择标准，并使用反馈控制机制动态调整客户端采样频率

Result: 在CIFAR-10数据集上，FedCLF相比FedAvg、Newt和Oort基线模型，在高数据异构场景下性能提升达16%，同时通过减少采样频率提高效率

Conclusion: FedCLF能有效应对联邦学习在车联网环境中的异构数据挑战，显著提升模型性能并优化资源利用

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is a distributed machine learning technique that
preserves data privacy by sharing only the trained parameters instead of the
client data. This makes FL ideal for highly dynamic, heterogeneous, and
time-critical applications, in particular, the Internet of Vehicles (IoV)
networks. However, FL encounters considerable challenges in such networks owing
to the high data and device heterogeneity. To address these challenges, we
propose FedCLF, i.e., FL with Calibrated Loss and Feedback control, which
introduces calibrated loss as a utility in the participant selection process
and a feedback control mechanism to dynamically adjust the sampling frequency
of the clients. The envisaged approach (a) enhances the overall model accuracy
in case of highly heterogeneous data and (b) optimizes the resource utilization
for resource constrained IoV networks, thereby leading to increased efficiency
in the FL process. We evaluated FedCLF vis-\`a-vis baseline models, i.e.,
FedAvg, Newt, and Oort, using CIFAR-10 dataset with varying data heterogeneity.
Our results depict that FedCLF significantly outperforms the baseline models by
up to a 16% improvement in high data heterogeneity-related scenarios with
improved efficiency via reduced sampling frequency.

Motivation: 准确识别打印头故障机制对制造商确保产品质量至关重要，Canon Production Printing的打印头故障可以通过喷嘴行为模式来识别。

Method: 采用基于特征的时序分类框架，在领域专家指导下选择时间和空间特征，评估多种传统ML分类器，最终选择One-vs-Rest随机森林。

Result: 提出的模型在多个故障机制的加权F1分数上优于内部基于规则的基准方法。

Conclusion: 基于机器学习的分类方法能够有效识别打印头故障机制，为产品质量控制提供了更准确的解决方案。

Abstract: Correct identification of failure mechanisms is essential for manufacturers
to ensure the quality of their products. Certain failures of printheads
developed by Canon Production Printing can be identified from the behavior of
individual nozzles, the states of which are constantly recorded and can form
distinct patterns in terms of the number of failed nozzles over time, and in
space in the nozzle grid. In our work, we investigate the problem of printhead
failure classification based on a multifaceted dataset of nozzle logging and
propose a Machine Learning classification approach for this problem. We follow
the feature-based framework of time-series classification, where a set of
time-based and spatial features was selected with the guidance of domain
experts. Several traditional ML classifiers were evaluated, and the One-vs-Rest
Random Forest was found to have the best performance. The proposed model
outperformed an in-house rule-based baseline in terms of a weighted F1 score
for several failure mechanisms.

TL;DR: PALADIN是一个训练语言代理在工具故障时进行稳健恢复的框架，通过系统性的故障注入和专家演示训练，显著提高了代理在真实工具环境中的故障恢复能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的代理训练管道只针对成功轨迹进行优化，未能让模型接触到在真实世界使用中占主导地位的工具故障，导致代理在部署时因工具故障而失败。

Method: 通过系统故障注入和专家演示构建50,000+恢复标注轨迹，使用LoRA微调保留基础能力的同时注入恢复能力，在推理时检测执行错误并从55+故障示例库中检索相似案例执行相应恢复操作。

Result: PALADIN将恢复率从32.76%提升到89.68%（相对提升57%），优于最强基线CRITIC（76.34%）13.3%，在未见工具API上保持95.2%的恢复性能。

Conclusion: PALADIN是构建能够在真实世界工具环境中进行稳健恢复的容错代理的有效方法。

Abstract: Tool-augmented language agents frequently fail in real-world deployment due
to tool malfunctions--timeouts, API exceptions, or inconsistent
outputs--triggering cascading reasoning errors and task abandonment. Existing
agent training pipelines optimize only for success trajectories, failing to
expose models to the tool failures that dominate real-world usage. We propose
\textbf{PALADIN}, a generalizable framework for equipping language agents with
robust failure recovery capabilities. PALADIN trains on 50,000+
recovery-annotated trajectories constructed via systematic failure injection
and expert demonstrations on an enhanced ToolBench dataset. Training uses
LoRA-based fine-tuning to retain base capabilities while injecting recovery
competence. At inference, PALADIN detects execution-time errors and retrieves
the most similar case from a curated bank of 55+ failure exemplars aligned with
ToolScan's taxonomy, then executes the corresponding recovery action. This
approach generalizes to novel failures beyond the training distribution,
retaining 95.2\% recovery performance on unseen tool APIs. Evaluation across
PaladinEval and ToolReflectEval demonstrates consistent improvements in
Recovery Rate (RR), Task Success Rate (TSR), Catastrophic Success Rate (CSR),
and Efficiency Score (ES). PALADIN improves RR from 32.76% to 89.68% (+57%
relative) over ToolBench and outperforms the strongest baseline CRITIC (76.34%)
by +13.3%. Against vanilla agents, PALADIN achieves 89.86\% RR (+66% relative
improvement from 23.75%). These results establish PALADIN as an effective
method for building fault-tolerant agents capable of robust recovery in
real-world tool environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的基于难度的课程强化学习方法存在局部优化问题，早期持续训练简单样本会导致策略失去探索能力。

Method: 将数据集评估中的多样性指标引入动态强化学习过程，通过最小语义哈密顿路径对训练样本进行排序，使初始训练保持更多探索。

Result: HAMMER激发了模型的"好奇心"，在多个推理基准上平均准确率提升了3%到4%。

Conclusion: 多样性驱动的排序有助于稳定收敛，从泛化界限的理论视角证明了该方法的有效性。

Abstract: Recent curriculum reinforcement learning for large language models (LLMs)
typically rely on difficulty-based annotations for data filtering and ordering.
However, such methods suffer from local optimization, where continual training
on simple samples in the early steps can cause the policy to lose its
exploration. We propose a novel schema, namely Hamiltonian curiosity augmented
large language model reinforcement (HAMMER), that transfers diversity metrics,
commonly used in dataset evaluation, into the dynamic reinforcement learning
procedure, where training samples are ordered via a minimum-semantic
Hamiltonian path making the initial training retrain more exploration. From a
theoretical perspective of generalization bounds, diversity-driven ordering
facilitates stable convergence. Empirical evaluations indicate that HAMMER
stimulates model "curiosity" and consistently achieves a 3% to 4% average
accuracy gain across diverse inference benchmark.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在通用领域表现出色，但在需要专业知识的特定领域（如网络安全）零样本性能不佳，因为基础模型设计为通用目的，难以在参数空间中封装领域特定知识。

Method: 使用网络安全问答数据集，研究监督微调（SFT）、低秩适应（LoRA）和量化低秩适应（QLoRA）三种微调策略，重点关注计算效率。

Result: 所有微调方法在网络安全问答任务中均显著优于基础模型，LoRA和QLoRA与SFT性能相当但计算成本大幅降低。

Conclusion: 低秩微调策略有潜力弥合通用大语言模型与领域特定应用之间的差距，为适应专业领域提供高效路径。

Abstract: Recent advancements in training paradigms for Large Language Models (LLMs)
have unlocked their remarkable capabilities in natural language processing and
cross-domain generalization. While LLMs excel in tasks like programming and
mathematical problem-solving, their zero-shot performance in specialized
domains requiring expert knowledge, such as cybersecurity, is often suboptimal.
This limitation arises because foundational LLMs are designed for
general-purpose applications, constraining their ability to encapsulate
domain-specific expertise within their parameter space. To address this, we
explore fine-tuning strategies to embed cybersecurity knowledge into LLMs,
enhancing their performance in cybersecurity question-answering (Q\&A) tasks
while prioritizing computational efficiency. Specifically, we investigate
Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), and Quantized
Low-Rank Adaptation (QLoRA) using a cybersecurity Q\&A dataset. Our results
demonstrate that these fine-tuning approaches significantly outperform the
foundational model in cybersecurity Q\&A tasks. Moreover, LoRA and QLoRA
achieve comparable performance to SFT with substantially lower computational
costs, offering an efficient pathway for adapting LLMs to specialized domains.
Our work highlights the potential of low-rank fine-tuning strategies to bridge
the gap between general-purpose LLMs and domain-specific applications.

Motivation: 传统特征蒸馏方法（如投影均方损失或CKA）无法有效捕捉教师模型的特征空间结构，即使损失为零时也存在问题。

Method: 提出使用Procrustes距离和特征Gram矩阵的Frobenius范数作为蒸馏损失函数，这些方法在表示对齐测量中已有应用。

Result: 在BERT和OPT模型上的分类和指令跟随任务中，新方法比现有特征蒸馏方法性能提升高达2个百分点，具有统计显著性。

Conclusion: 将特征几何结构整合到现有蒸馏方法中具有巨大潜力，能够显著提升知识蒸馏性能。

Abstract: Knowledge distillation is a common paradigm for transferring capabilities
from larger models to smaller ones. While traditional distillation methods
leverage a probabilistic divergence over the output of the teacher and student
models, feature-based distillation methods often minimize variants of Euclidean
norms between the hidden layer representations. The main goal is for the
student to mimic the structure of the feature space of the teacher. In this
work, we theoretically show that existing feature distillation methods, such as
projection based mean squared loss or Centered Kernel Alignment (CKA), cannot
capture the feature structure, even under zero loss. We then motivate the use
of Procrustes distance and the Frobenius norm of Feature Gram Matrix, distances
already common in the context of measuring representational alignment, as
distillation losses. We show that feature distillation through our method
showcases statistically significant improvement in distillation performance
across language models families (BERT and OPT) in classification and
instruction-following tasks by up to 2 percentage points, showcasing the
potential of integrating feature geometry into existing distillation methods.

Abstract: Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs)-assisted mobile crowdsensing (MCS) has
emerged as a promising paradigm for data collection. However, challenges such
as spectrum scarcity, device heterogeneity, and user mobility hinder efficient
coordination of sensing, communication, and computation. To tackle these
issues, we propose a joint optimization framework that integrates time slot
partition for sensing, communication, and computation phases, resource
allocation, and UAV 3D trajectory planning, aiming to maximize the amount of
processed sensing data. The problem is formulated as a non-convex stochastic
optimization and further modeled as a partially observable Markov decision
process (POMDP) that can be solved by multi-agent deep reinforcement learning
(MADRL) algorithm. To overcome the limitations of conventional multi-layer
perceptron (MLP) networks, we design a novel MADRL algorithm with hybrid actor
network. The newly developed method is based on heterogeneous agent proximal
policy optimization (HAPPO), empowered by convolutional neural networks (CNN)
for feature extraction and Kolmogorov-Arnold networks (KAN) to capture
structured state-action dependencies. Extensive numerical results demonstrate
that our proposed method achieves significant improvements in the amount of
processed sensing data when compared with other benchmarks.

Motivation: 现有气象时间序列预测基准主要评估温度、湿度等周期性强的变量，无法反映降雨临近预报这种更复杂实际场景的模型能力。降雨预测具有零膨胀、时间衰减和非平稳性等挑战性特征。

Method: 构建RainfallBench数据集，包含6个关键变量，15分钟间隔的5年观测数据。设计了专门的评估策略来评估多尺度预测和极端降雨事件。提出了BFPF（双焦点降水预报器）模块，融入领域先验知识来增强降雨时间序列预测。

Conclusion: RainfallBench填补了降雨临近预报基准的空白，BFPF模块有效解决了现有模型忽略的零膨胀和时间衰减问题，为复杂气象场景的预测提供了更好的评估框架。

Abstract: Rainfall nowcasting, which aims to predict precipitation within the next 0 to
3 hours, is critical for disaster mitigation and real-time response planning.
However, most time series forecasting benchmarks in meteorology are evaluated
on variables with strong periodicity, such as temperature and humidity, which
fail to reflect model capabilities in more complex and practically meteorology
scenarios like rainfall nowcasting. To address this gap, we propose
RainfallBench, a benchmark designed for rainfall nowcasting, a highly
challenging and practically relevant task characterized by zero inflation,
temporal decay, and non-stationarity, focused on predicting precipitation
within the next 0 to 3 hours. The dataset is derived from five years of
meteorological observations, recorded at 15-minute intervals across six
essential variables, and collected from more than 12,000 GNSS stations
globally. In particular, it incorporates precipitable water vapor (PWV), a
crucial indicator of rainfall that is absent in other datasets. We further
design specialized evaluation strategies to assess model performance on key
meteorological challenges, such as multi-scale prediction and extreme rainfall
events, and evaluate over 20 state-of-the-art models across six major
architectures on RainfallBench. Additionally, to address the zero-inflation and
temporal decay issues overlooked by existing models, we introduce Bi-Focus
Precipitation Forecaster (BFPF), a plug-and-play module that incorporates
domain-specific priors to enhance rainfall time series forecasting. Statistical
analysis and ablation studies validate the comprehensiveness of our dataset as
well as the superiority of our methodology. Code and datasets are available at

Motivation: 现有静态提示策略（如Zero-Shot、Few-Shot、CoT）在效率与准确率之间存在刚性权衡，准确率高的方法在简单任务上造成计算浪费，轻量级方法在复杂输入上表现不佳。

Method: 提出Prompt Policy Network (PPN)框架，将自适应策略选择形式化为单步马尔可夫决策过程，使用PPO算法训练，并采用资源显式奖励函数。

Result: 在算术推理基准测试中，PPN在效率-准确率帕累托前沿上表现优异，相比Self-Consistency可减少61.5%的token成本，同时保持竞争力准确率。

Conclusion: PPN为成本高效的LLM部署提供了系统性自适应框架，推动了轻量级优化技术的发展，支持可扩展和可持续的语言模型应用。

Abstract: The performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) depends heavily on the chosen
prompting strategy, yet static approaches such as Zero-Shot, Few-Shot, or
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) impose a rigid efficiency-accuracy trade-off. Highly
accurate strategies like Self-Consistency (SC) incur substantial computational
waste on simple tasks, while lightweight methods often fail on complex inputs.
This paper introduces the Prompt Policy Network (PPN), a lightweight
reinforcement learning framework that formalizes adaptive strategy selection as
a single-step Markov Decision Process (MDP). The PPN, trained with Proximal
Policy Optimization (PPO) and guided by a resource-explicit reward function,
learns to allocate costly reasoning strategies only when necessary. Experiments
on arithmetic reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that PPN achieves superior
performance on the efficiency-accuracy Pareto front, delivering up to 61.5%
token cost reduction compared to Self-Consistency while maintaining competitive
accuracy. This work contributes a systematic, adaptive framework for
cost-efficient LLM deployment, advancing the design of lightweight optimization
techniques for scalable and sustainable language model applications.

Abstract: Weather foundation models (WFMs) have recently set new benchmarks in global

study, we fine-tune Silurian AI's 1.5B-parameter WFM, Generative Forecasting
Transformer (GFT), on a rich archive of Hydro-Qu\'ebec asset
observations--including transmission-line weather stations, wind-farm met-mast
streams, and icing sensors--to deliver hyper-local, asset-level forecasts for
five grid-critical variables: surface temperature, precipitation, hub-height
wind speed, wind-turbine icing risk, and rime-ice accretion on overhead
conductors. Across 6-72 h lead times, the tailored model surpasses
state-of-the-art NWP benchmarks, trimming temperature mean absolute error (MAE)
by 15%, total-precipitation MAE by 35%, and lowering wind speed MAE by 15%.
Most importantly, it attains an average precision score of 0.72 for day-ahead
rime-ice detection, a capability absent from existing operational systems,
which affords several hours of actionable warning for potentially catastrophic
outage events. These results show that WFMs, when post-trained with small
amounts of high-fidelity, can serve as a practical foundation for
next-generation grid-resilience intelligence.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法难以有效捕捉多模态间的完整协同信息，而协同信息是多模态表示的核心价值所在

Method: 使用无限掩码策略随机遮蔽各模态的大部分特征，仅保留部分信息创建具有不同协同模式的表示，通过互信息最大化对齐掩码前后的表示

Result: 在受控实验中证明能有效增强模态间协同信息，在大规模真实数据集上七个基准测试中达到SOTA性能

Conclusion: InfMasking通过无限掩码策略成功解决了多模态协同信息提取的挑战，为多模态表示学习提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: In multimodal representation learning, synergistic interactions between
modalities not only provide complementary information but also create unique
outcomes through specific interaction patterns that no single modality could
achieve alone. Existing methods may struggle to effectively capture the full
spectrum of synergistic information, leading to suboptimal performance in tasks
where such interactions are critical. This is particularly problematic because
synergistic information constitutes the fundamental value proposition of
multimodal representation. To address this challenge, we introduce InfMasking,
a contrastive synergistic information extraction method designed to enhance
synergistic information through an \textbf{Inf}inite \textbf{Masking} strategy.
InfMasking stochastically occludes most features from each modality during
fusion, preserving only partial information to create representations with
varied synergistic patterns. Unmasked fused representations are then aligned
with masked ones through mutual information maximization to encode
comprehensive synergistic information. This infinite masking strategy enables
capturing richer interactions by exposing the model to diverse partial modality
combinations during training. As computing mutual information estimates with
infinite masking is computationally prohibitive, we derive an InfMasking loss
to approximate this calculation. Through controlled experiments, we demonstrate
that InfMasking effectively enhances synergistic information between
modalities. In evaluations on large-scale real-world datasets, InfMasking
achieves state-of-the-art performance across seven benchmarks. Code is released
at https://github.com/brightest66/InfMasking.

*Payal Mohapatra,Yueyuan Sui,Akash Pandey,Stephen Xia,Qi Zhu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MAESTRO是一个新颖的多模态学习框架，通过动态跨模态交互、符号化标记和稀疏注意力机制，解决了现有方法依赖单一主模态、成对建模和完整模态假设的局限性，在完整和部分观测条件下均表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多模态学习方法存在三个主要限制：(1)依赖单一主模态进行对齐，(2)成对建模方式，(3)假设完整模态观测。这些限制阻碍了在真实世界多模态时间序列场景中的应用，因为主模态先验不明确、模态数量可能很大、传感器故障导致任意缺失观测。

Method: MAESTRO框架通过动态模态内和跨模态交互、符号化标记和自适应注意力预算构建长多模态序列，使用稀疏跨模态注意力处理，并通过稀疏混合专家机制路由跨模态标记，实现不同模态组合下的黑盒专业化。

Result: 在四个不同数据集上评估，MAESTRO在完整观测条件下相比现有最佳多模态和多变量方法分别平均提升4%和8%；在部分观测条件下（缺失模态高达40%），平均提升9%。

Conclusion: MAESTRO的稀疏、模态感知设计在动态时间序列学习中表现出鲁棒性和高效性，为真实世界多模态监控应用提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: From clinical healthcare to daily living, continuous sensor monitoring across
multiple modalities has shown great promise for real-world intelligent
decision-making but also faces various challenges. In this work, we introduce
MAESTRO, a novel framework that overcomes key limitations of existing
multimodal learning approaches: (1) reliance on a single primary modality for
alignment, (2) pairwise modeling of modalities, and (3) assumption of complete
modality observations. These limitations hinder the applicability of these
approaches in real-world multimodal time-series settings, where primary
modality priors are often unclear, the number of modalities can be large
(making pairwise modeling impractical), and sensor failures often result in
arbitrary missing observations. At its core, MAESTRO facilitates dynamic intra-
and cross-modal interactions based on task relevance, and leverages symbolic
tokenization and adaptive attention budgeting to construct long multimodal
sequences, which are processed via sparse cross-modal attention. The resulting
cross-modal tokens are routed through a sparse Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)
mechanism, enabling black-box specialization under varying modality
combinations. We evaluate MAESTRO against 10 baselines on four diverse datasets
spanning three applications, and observe average relative improvements of 4%
and 8% over the best existing multimodal and multivariate approaches,
respectively, under complete observations. Under partial observations -- with
up to 40% of missing modalities -- MAESTRO achieves an average 9% improvement.
Further analysis also demonstrates the robustness and efficiency of MAESTRO's
sparse, modality-aware design for learning from dynamic time series.

Using real base station coordinates, we compare Proximal Policy Optimisation

frameworks outperform heuristic algorithms in optimising resource allocation in

Result: 在合成和真实世界基准测试中，该模型始终优于传统聚类有效性指标（如Silhouette、Calinski-Harabasz等）和最先进的AutoML聚类推荐方法（如ML2DAC、AutoCluster等）。在合成数据上比Calinski-Harabasz指数提高0.497 ARI，在真实数据上比最佳AutoML方法提高15.3% ARI。

Conclusion: ClustRecNet通过深度学习有效解决了聚类算法选择问题，显著优于传统方法和现有AutoML方法，为无监督学习提供了更可靠的算法推荐解决方案。

Abstract: We introduce ClustRecNet - a novel deep learning (DL)-based recommendation
framework for determining the most suitable clustering algorithms for a given
dataset, addressing the long-standing challenge of clustering algorithm
selection in unsupervised learning. To enable supervised learning in this
context, we construct a comprehensive data repository comprising 34,000
synthetic datasets with diverse structural properties. Each of them was
processed using 10 popular clustering algorithms. The resulting clusterings
were assessed via the Adjusted Rand Index (ARI) to establish ground truth
labels, used for training and evaluation of our DL model. The proposed network
architecture integrates convolutional, residual, and attention mechanisms to
capture both local and global structural patterns from the input data. This
design supports end-to-end training to learn compact representations of
datasets and enables direct recommendation of the most suitable clustering
algorithm, reducing reliance on handcrafted meta-features and traditional
Cluster Validity Indices (CVIs). Comprehensive experiments across synthetic and
real-world benchmarks demonstrate that our DL model consistently outperforms
conventional CVIs (e.g. Silhouette, Calinski-Harabasz, Davies-Bouldin, and
Dunn) as well as state-of-the-art AutoML clustering recommendation approaches
(e.g. ML2DAC, AutoCluster, and AutoML4Clust). Notably, the proposed model
achieves a 0.497 ARI improvement over the Calinski-Harabasz index on synthetic
data and a 15.3% ARI gain over the best-performing AutoML approach on
real-world data.

TL;DR: 本文系统研究了LLM在强化学习后训练中的扩展规律，发现大模型在固定计算预算下表现更好，样本效率更高，数据重复使用有效，且这些规律在不同模型类型中具有鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然大语言模型预训练阶段的扩展规律已被广泛研究，但它们在强化学习后训练中的行为仍未被充分探索，特别是在数学推理任务上。

Method: 基于54个实验，系统分析模型规模、数据量和计算预算在RL后训练中的交互作用，重点关注数学推理任务。

Result: 发现四个关键规律：1) 固定计算预算下，大模型训练少步数优于小模型多步数；2) 固定数据量下，大模型样本效率更高；3) 数据受限时，重复使用高质量数据有效；4) 这些规律在基础模型和指令调优模型中均成立。

Conclusion: 为通过RL后训练高效扩展LLM推理能力提供了理论基础和实践指导。

Abstract: While scaling laws for large language models (LLMs) during pre-training have
been extensively studied, their behavior under reinforcement learning (RL)
post-training remains largely unexplored. This paper presents a systematic
empirical investigation of scaling behaviors in RL-based post-training, with a
particular focus on mathematical reasoning. Based on 54 experiments across
diverse model sizes and training settings, we characterize how model scale,
data volume, and computational budget interact to shape performance. Our
analysis leads to four key findings: (1). Under a fixed computational budget,
larger models trained for fewer steps consistently outperform smaller models
trained for more steps. (2). Given a fixed amount of training data, larger
models achieve superior sample efficiency, yielding lower loss. (3). In
data-constrained regimes, repeated reuse of high-quality data proves highly
effective, as final performance is primarily governed by the total number of
optimization steps rather than the uniqueness of samples. (4). These scaling
behaviors are robust across both base and instruction-tuned models, which share
similar learning dynamics (e.g., larger models show faster convergence) even
while differing in absolute accuracy. Collectively, these results provide a
principled foundation and practical guidelines for efficiently scaling the
reasoning capabilities of LLMs through RL post-training.

TL;DR: LEO-CVAE是一种生成式过采样方法，通过局部熵引导在类别重叠的不确定区域生成样本，解决了传统过采样方法在处理高维生物医学数据时的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统过采样方法如SMOTE依赖局部线性插值，在处理高维非线性生物医学数据时会产生不合理的合成样本。虽然条件变分自编码器能更好地捕捉非线性分布，但标准变体忽视了边界区域不确定样本的重要性。

Method: 提出局部熵引导的CVAE过采样框架，通过计算样本邻域的香农熵来量化不确定性，并使用局部熵加权损失和熵引导采样策略，在类别重叠的不确定区域集中生成样本。

Result: 在临床基因组数据集（ADNI和TCGA肺癌）上的实验表明，LEO-CVAE持续提升分类器性能，优于传统过采样方法和生成式基线方法。

Conclusion: 结果表明，在由复杂非线性结构主导的领域（如组学数据）中，不确定性感知的生成式过采样对于不平衡学习具有重要价值。

Abstract: Class imbalance remains a major challenge in machine learning, especially for
high-dimensional biomedical data where nonlinear manifold structures dominate.
Traditional oversampling methods such as SMOTE rely on local linear
interpolation, often producing implausible synthetic samples. Deep generative
models like Conditional Variational Autoencoders (CVAEs) better capture
nonlinear distributions, but standard variants treat all minority samples
equally, neglecting the importance of uncertain, boundary-region examples
emphasized by heuristic methods like Borderline-SMOTE and ADASYN.
  We propose Local Entropy-Guided Oversampling with a CVAE (LEO-CVAE), a
generative oversampling framework that explicitly incorporates local
uncertainty into both representation learning and data generation. To quantify
uncertainty, we compute Shannon entropy over the class distribution in a
sample's neighborhood: high entropy indicates greater class overlap, serving as
a proxy for uncertainty. LEO-CVAE leverages this signal through two mechanisms:
(i) a Local Entropy-Weighted Loss (LEWL) that emphasizes robust learning in
uncertain regions, and (ii) an entropy-guided sampling strategy that
concentrates generation in these informative, class-overlapping areas.
  Applied to clinical genomics datasets (ADNI and TCGA lung cancer), LEO-CVAE
consistently improves classifier performance, outperforming both traditional
oversampling and generative baselines. These results highlight the value of
uncertainty-aware generative oversampling for imbalanced learning in domains
governed by complex nonlinear structures, such as omics data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索梯度下降在矩阵分解中的动力学行为，特别是大学习率下的收敛特性和参数空间结构。

Method: 通过理论分析推导标量-向量分解的临界学习率，研究正则化对收敛边界的影响，并将分析扩展到正交初始化的通用矩阵分解。

Result: 发现临界学习率附近存在混沌区域，长期动态不可预测，且没有简单的隐式偏置（如平衡性、最小范数或平坦性）。

Conclusion: 大学习率下的梯度下降在矩阵分解中会产生分形结构和混沌行为，挑战了传统关于隐式偏置的假设。

Abstract: We examine gradient descent in matrix factorization and show that under large
step sizes the parameter space develops a fractal structure. We derive the
exact critical step size for convergence in scalar-vector factorization and
show that near criticality the selected minimizer depends sensitively on the
initialization. Moreover, we show that adding regularization amplifies this
sensitivity, generating a fractal boundary between initializations that
converge and those that diverge. The analysis extends to general matrix
factorization with orthogonal initialization. Our findings reveal that
near-critical step sizes induce a chaotic regime of gradient descent where the
long-term dynamics are unpredictable and there are no simple implicit biases,
such as towards balancedness, minimum norm, or flatness.

Abstract: We study active correlation clustering where pairwise similarities are not
provided upfront and must be queried in a cost-efficient manner through active
learning. Specifically, we focus on the cold-start scenario, where no true
initial pairwise similarities are available for active learning. To address
this challenge, we propose a coverage-aware method that encourages diversity
early in the process. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through
several synthetic and real-world experiments.

Conclusion: 该方法成功将物理原理融入蛋白质生成过程，提升了生成结构的物理真实性和设计潜力。

Abstract: Protein structure prediction and folding are fundamental to understanding
biology, with recent deep learning advances reshaping the field.
Diffusion-based generative models have revolutionized protein design, enabling
the creation of novel proteins. However, these methods often neglect the
intrinsic physical realism of proteins, driven by noising dynamics that lack
grounding in physical principles. To address this, we first introduce a
physically motivated non-linear noising process, grounded in classical physics,
that unfolds proteins into secondary structures (e.g., alpha helices, linear
beta sheets) while preserving topological integrity--maintaining bonds, and
preventing collisions. We then integrate this process with the flow-matching
paradigm on SE(3) to model the invariant distribution of protein backbones with
high fidelity, incorporating sequence information to enable
sequence-conditioned folding and expand the generative capabilities of our
model. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves
state-of-the-art performance in unconditional protein generation, producing
more designable and novel protein structures while accurately folding monomer
sequences into precise protein conformations.

Motivation: 数据课程对LLM训练至关重要，但最优数据放置原则仍不明确，需要一种方法来评估和优化训练数据的时间安排。

Method: 引入TREC诊断工具，使用最终模型权重回顾性评估训练批次，分析不同参数规模模型的TREC，并利用AdamW的EMA系数预测TREC。

Result: 分析111M到3.9B参数模型显示，将高质量数据放在TREC低点显著提升性能；能提前预测TREC；通过优化数据放置改善了3.9B参数LLM的持续预训练。

Conclusion: TREC为数据课程设计提供了重要工具，能够解释先前消融实验结果并揭示次优数据放置，通过预测和优化TREC可以显著提升模型性能。

Abstract: Data curriculums have become central to successful LLM training, yet
principles governing optimal data placement remain unclear. We introduce the
*training re-evaluation curve (TREC)*, a diagnostic that retrospectively
evaluates training batches *using the final model weights*. The TREC
characterizes how well a trained model retains training data as a function of
*when* the data was encountered during training. Analyzing TRECs for models
from 111M to 3.9B parameters, we show that placing high-quality data at low
points on the TREC significantly improves performance. Importantly, while a
TREC is initially observable only after training, we demonstrate it can be
*predicted in advance* from AdamW's implicit EMA coefficients, enabling
proactive curriculum design. By predicting TRECs for published training
recipes, we explain prior ablations and reveal suboptimal data placements. We
also align high-quality data with TREC minima in order to improve continual
pre-training of a 3.9B-parameter LLM trained on 900B tokens.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在重症监护等场景中，需要处理功能协变量和缺失数据，传统方法难以有效整合这些信息进行生存分析。

Method: 结合微网络基础层表示功能数据，使用基于梯度的插补模块，同时学习缺失值插补和事件特定风险预测。

Result: 在模拟数据集和真实ICU案例研究中，FCRN相比随机生存森林和传统竞争风险模型，预测准确率显著提升。

Conclusion: FCRN通过更有效地捕捉动态风险因素和静态预测因子，同时处理不规则和不完整数据，推进了重症监护中的预后建模。

Abstract: We introduce the Functional Competing Risk Net (FCRN), a unified
deep-learning framework for discrete-time survival analysis under competing
risks, which seamlessly integrates functional covariates and handles missing
data within an end-to-end model. By combining a micro-network Basis Layer for
functional data representation with a gradient-based imputation module, FCRN
simultaneously learns to impute missing values and predict event-specific
hazards. Evaluated on multiple simulated datasets and a real-world ICU case
study using the MIMIC-IV and Cleveland Clinic datasets, FCRN demonstrates
substantial improvements in prediction accuracy over random survival forests
and traditional competing risks models. This approach advances prognostic
modeling in critical care by more effectively capturing dynamic risk factors
and static predictors while accommodating irregular and incomplete data.

Abstract: This paper introduces mixsemble, an ensemble method that adapts the
Dawid-Skene model to aggregate predictions from multiple model-based clustering

framework models the outputs of clustering algorithms as noisy annotations.
Experiments on both simulated and real-world datasets show that, although the
mixsemble is not always the single top performer, it consistently approaches
the best result and avoids poor outcomes. This robustness makes it a practical
alternative when the true data structure is unknown, especially for non-expert
users.

Conclusion: 多任务贝叶斯推断能够减轻方程发现中的过拟合问题，促进模型泛化，特别适用于结构健康监测中不同载荷条件揭示系统物理互补方面的情况。

Abstract: Equation discovery provides a grey-box approach to system identification by
uncovering governing dynamics directly from observed data. However, a
persistent challenge lies in ensuring that identified models generalise across
operating conditions rather than over-fitting to specific datasets. This work
investigates this issue by applying a Bayesian relevance vector machine (RVM)
within a multi-task learning (MTL) framework for simultaneous parameter
identification across multiple datasets. In this formulation, responses from
the same structure under different excitation levels are treated as related
tasks that share model parameters but retain task-specific noise
characteristics. A simulated single degree-of-freedom oscillator with linear
and cubic stiffness provided the case study, with datasets generated under
three excitation regimes. Standard single-task RVM models were able to
reproduce system responses but often failed to recover the true governing terms
when excitations insufficiently stimulated non-linear dynamics. By contrast,
the MTL-RVM combined information across tasks, improving parameter recovery for
weakly and moderately excited datasets, while maintaining strong performance
under high excitation. These findings demonstrate that multi-task Bayesian
inference can mitigate over-fitting and promote generalisation in equation
discovery. The approach is particularly relevant to structural health
monitoring, where varying load conditions reveal complementary aspects of
system physics.

Motivation: 研究发现LoRA中的内部A矩阵相似性主要源于相同的初始化而非共享知识，而B矩阵在知识编码和传输中起更关键作用。

Method: 提出ALoRA（多任务微调中使用多个A矩阵共享单个B）和Fed-ALoRA（联邦学习中跨客户端共享B，通过矩阵分解策略处理异构秩）。

Result: 在常识推理、数学推理、多任务NLP数据集和联邦NLP数据集上的实验表明，相比现有多LoRA方法，新方法在保持相当或更高平均准确率的同时实现更平衡的任务性能。

Conclusion: 不对称的LoRA设计能有效提升多任务和联邦学习场景下的性能平衡性，B矩阵的共享是提升知识传输效率的关键。

Abstract: Large language models are often adapted using parameter-efficient techniques
such as Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), formulated as $y = W_0x + BAx$, where $W_0$
is the pre-trained parameters and $x$ is the input to the adapted layer. While
multi-adapter extensions often employ multiple LoRAs, prior studies suggest
that the inner $A$ matrices are highly similar during training and thus
suitable for sharing. We revisit this phenomenon and find that this similarity
is largely attributable to the identical initialization rather than shared
knowledge, with $B$ playing a more critical role in knowledge encoding and
transfer. Motivated by these insights, we propose \textbf{ALoRA}, an asymmetric
multi-LoRA design with multiple $A$ matrices and a single shared $B$ in
multi-task fine-tuning, and \textbf{Fed-ALoRA}, which shares $B$ across clients
in federated fine-tuning under both homogeneous and heterogeneous settings,
through a novel matrix decomposition strategy to accommodate heterogeneous
ranks across clients. Experiments on commonsense reasoning, math reasoning,
multi-task NLP dataset, and federated NLP dataset demonstrate that our methods
achieve more balanced performance across tasks with comparable or superior
average accuracy relative to existing multi-LoRA approaches. Codes are

TL;DR: 提出了HIA攻击框架，针对时序图神经网络(TGNNs)进行高效隐蔽的黑盒攻击，通过识别结构重要性和动态重要性节点，结合边注入和删除策略，显著降低TGNN性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有STDG攻击方法依赖简单扰动且易被检测，无法战略性攻击最具影响力的节点和边，TGNN在对抗攻击下的鲁棒性仍是重大挑战。

Method: 使用数据驱动的代理模型识别结构重要节点和动态重要节点，采用混合扰动策略（战略边注入和定向边删除），最小化扰动数量以增强隐蔽性。

Result: 在5个真实数据集和4种TGNN架构上的实验表明，HIA显著降低链接预测任务的准确率，MRR最多下降35.55%，优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: 结果揭示了当前STDG模型的基本漏洞，强调了开发同时考虑结构和时间动态的鲁棒防御的紧迫性。

Abstract: Temporal Graph Neural Networks (TGNNs) have become indispensable for
analyzing dynamic graphs in critical applications such as social networks,
communication systems, and financial networks. However, the robustness of TGNNs
against adversarial attacks, particularly sophisticated attacks that exploit
the temporal dimension, remains a significant challenge. Existing attack
methods for Spatio-Temporal Dynamic Graphs (STDGs) often rely on simplistic,
easily detectable perturbations (e.g., random edge additions/deletions) and
fail to strategically target the most influential nodes and edges for maximum
impact. We introduce the High Impact Attack (HIA), a novel restricted black-box
attack framework specifically designed to overcome these limitations and expose
critical vulnerabilities in TGNNs. HIA leverages a data-driven surrogate model
to identify structurally important nodes (central to network connectivity) and
dynamically important nodes (critical for the graph's temporal evolution). It
then employs a hybrid perturbation strategy, combining strategic edge injection
(to create misleading connections) and targeted edge deletion (to disrupt
essential pathways), maximizing TGNN performance degradation. Importantly, HIA
minimizes the number of perturbations to enhance stealth, making it more
challenging to detect. Comprehensive experiments on five real-world datasets
and four representative TGNN architectures (TGN, JODIE, DySAT, and TGAT)
demonstrate that HIA significantly reduces TGNN accuracy on the link prediction
task, achieving up to a 35.55% decrease in Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR) - a
substantial improvement over state-of-the-art baselines. These results
highlight fundamental vulnerabilities in current STDG models and underscore the
urgent need for robust defenses that account for both structural and temporal
dynamics.

Motivation: 解决RLFT中策略多样性丧失的问题，防止策略崩溃为少数易被利用的输出，从而促进探索和提升测试时计算扩展的效益。

Method: 引入多目标策略梯度方法，采用vine采样收集策略轨迹，并修改优势函数以反映新目标下的优势。

Result: 在BabyAI、Minigrid和Algorithmic Creativity等实验中，方法提高了成功率，能解决更多环境配置，并在大扰动下泛化更好。在pass@k实验中，策略实现了更高的覆盖率。

Conclusion: 多目标方法能有效保持和利用多样化的策略库，提升RLFT的性能和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning fine-tuning (RLFT) is a dominant paradigm for
improving pretrained policies for downstream tasks. These pretrained policies,
trained on large datasets, produce generations with a broad range of promising
but unrefined behaviors. Often, a critical failure mode of RLFT arises when
policies lose this diversity and collapse into a handful of easily exploitable
outputs. This convergence hinders exploration, which is essential for expanding
the capabilities of the pretrained policy and for amplifying the benefits of
test-time compute scaling. To address this, we introduce an objective for
policy gradient methods that explicitly enforces the exploration and refinement
of diverse generations, which we call a polychromic objective. We then show how
proximal policy optimization (PPO) can be adapted to optimize this objective.
Our method (1) employs vine sampling to collect on-policy rollouts and (2)
modifies the advantage function to reflect the advantage under our new
objective. Experiments on BabyAI, Minigrid, and Algorithmic Creativity show
that our method improves success rates by reliably solving a larger set of
environment configurations and generalizes better under large perturbations.
Moreover, when given multiple attempts in pass@$k$ experiments, the policy
achieves substantially higher coverage, demonstrating its ability to maintain
and exploit a diverse repertoire of strategies.

Conclusion: 该方法将控制理论与广告系统结合，为预算节奏控制提供了可扩展且可靠的解决方案，特别有利于小预算广告活动

Abstract: Budget pacing is critical in online advertising to align spend with campaign
goals under dynamic auctions. Existing pacing methods often rely on ad-hoc
parameter tuning, which can be unstable and inefficient. We propose a
principled controller that combines bucketized hysteresis with proportional
feedback to provide stable and adaptive spend control. Our method provides a
framework and analysis for parameter selection that enables accurate tracking
of desired spend rates across campaigns. Experiments in real-world auctions
demonstrate significant improvements in pacing accuracy and delivery
consistency, reducing pacing error by 13% and $\lambda$-volatility by 54%
compared to baseline method. By bridging control theory with advertising
systems, our approach offers a scalable and reliable solution for budget
pacing, with particular benefits for small-budget campaigns.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为学习进度监控（LPM）的新方法，通过奖励模型改进而非预测误差或新颖性来引导探索，有效解决噪声环境中的探索问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于内在奖励的探索方法在面对不可学习的随机噪声源（如noisy-TV）时容易被困，而基于不确定性估计或分布相似性的方法虽然最终能逃脱，但样本效率低且计算成本高。受神经科学发现启发，人类在探索过程中会监控自己的进步。

Method: 采用双网络设计：使用误差模型预测动态模型在先前迭代中的预期预测误差，利用当前迭代与先前迭代模型误差的差异来指导探索。

Result: 在基于MNIST、3D迷宫和Atari的噪声环境中，LPM的内在奖励收敛更快，在迷宫实验中探索更多状态，在Atari中获得更高的外在奖励。

Conclusion: LPM概念简单但有效，标志着噪声鲁棒探索的范式转变，通过监控学习进度而非预测误差来实现更高效的探索。

Abstract: When there exists an unlearnable source of randomness (noisy-TV) in the
environment, a naively intrinsic reward driven exploring agent gets stuck at
that source of randomness and fails at exploration. Intrinsic reward based on
uncertainty estimation or distribution similarity, while eventually escapes
noisy-TVs as time unfolds, suffers from poor sample efficiency and high
computational cost. Inspired by recent findings from neuroscience that humans
monitor their improvements during exploration, we propose a novel method for
intrinsically-motivated exploration, named Learning Progress Monitoring (LPM).
During exploration, LPM rewards model improvements instead of prediction error
or novelty, effectively rewards the agent for observing learnable transitions
rather than the unlearnable transitions. We introduce a dual-network design
that uses an error model to predict the expected prediction error of the
dynamics model in its previous iteration, and use the difference between the
model errors of the current iteration and previous iteration to guide
exploration. We theoretically show that the intrinsic reward of LPM is
zero-equivariant and a monotone indicator of Information Gain (IG), and that
the error model is necessary to achieve monotonicity correspondence with IG. We
empirically compared LPM against state-of-the-art baselines in noisy
environments based on MNIST, 3D maze with 160x120 RGB inputs, and Atari.
Results show that LPM's intrinsic reward converges faster, explores more states
in the maze experiment, and achieves higher extrinsic reward in Atari. This
conceptually simple approach marks a shift-of-paradigm of noise-robust
exploration. For code to reproduce our experiments, see

*Hanyuan Gao,Xiaoxuan Yang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出Norm-Q方法，一种用于压缩概率符号模型（如隐马尔可夫模型）的归一化线性量化方法，通过减少数据位宽来缓解内存和带宽压力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 神经符号应用中，隐马尔可夫模型等概率符号模型存在计算密集和数据传输量大的问题，限制了其在定制硬件上的部署。

Method: 采用归一化量化感知的期望最大化过程进行概率模型训练，通过降低数据位宽实现压缩。

Result: 在大型语言模型的约束生成任务中，成功将4096隐藏状态的HMM量化为8位无损失，最多3位可接受损失，权重压缩率达到99%。

Conclusion: Norm-Q方法相比传统量化方法实现了更高的压缩率和合理的分数损失，有效解决了概率符号模型的内存和带宽瓶颈问题。

Abstract: Hidden Markov models (HMM) are commonly used in generation tasks and have
demonstrated strong capabilities in neuro-symbolic applications for the Markov
property. These applications leverage the strengths of neural networks and
symbolic reasoning to create robust and interpretable AI systems. However, they
may inherit and amplify the shortcomings of both approaches. Both components
require dense computation and data transfer, and their communication further
hinders performance. This paper proposes Norm-Q, a normalized linear
quantization approach for compressing probabilistic symbolic models, such as
HMMs. We reduce the bit width of the data with minimal impact, thereby
alleviating memory and bandwidth stress and enabling deployment on potential
custom hardware. Our method introduces a normalized quantization-aware
expectation maximization process for probabilistic model training. The
experimental results show that Norm-Q achieves a higher compression rate with
reasonable score loss compared to traditional quantization methods. In the case
of the constrained generation task of large language models, we successfully
quantize an HMM of 4096 hidden states to 8 bits without loss and, at most, 3
bits with acceptable loss. Notably, the Norm-Q method can achieve a compression
rate of 99% for the weights of the HMM. The code is open source at

Conclusion: 这项工作为基于联合嵌入的未来时间序列基础模型开发奠定了基础，展示了其作为学习通用表示的强大潜力。

Abstract: Self-supervised learning has seen great success recently in unsupervised
representation learning, enabling breakthroughs in natural language and image
processing. However, these methods often rely on autoregressive and masked
modeling, which aim to reproduce masked information in the input, which can be
vulnerable to the presence of noise or confounding variables. To address this
problem, Joint-Embedding Predictive Architectures (JEPA) has been introduced
with the aim to perform self-supervised learning in the latent space. To
leverage these advancements in the domain of time series, we introduce Time
Series JEPA (TS-JEPA), an architecture specifically adapted for time series
representation learning. We validate TS-JEPA on both classification and
forecasting, showing that it can match or surpass current state-of-the-art
baselines on different standard datasets. Notably, our approach demonstrates a
strong performance balance across diverse tasks, indicating its potential as a
robust foundation for learning general representations. Thus, this work lays
the groundwork for developing future time series foundation models based on
Joint Embedding.

Motivation: 通用机器人策略通常需要大量专家数据或模拟训练，本工作旨在开发一种数据高效的方法来学习多任务策略。

Method: 使用性能感知调度策略，基于卡尔曼滤波估计器跟踪每个任务从数据量中获益的程度，智能分配额外演示数据。

Conclusion: 该方法能够高效学习多任务策略，在减少专家数据需求的同时保持高性能，并具有良好的零样本迁移能力。

Abstract: Generalist robot policies that can perform many tasks typically require
extensive expert data or simulations for training. In this work, we propose a
novel Data-Efficient multitask DAgger framework that distills a single
multitask policy from multiple task-specific expert policies. Our approach
significantly increases the overall task success rate by actively focusing on
tasks where the multitask policy underperforms. The core of our method is a
performance-aware scheduling strategy that tracks how much each task's learning
process benefits from the amount of data, using a Kalman filter-based estimator
to robustly decide how to allocate additional demonstrations across tasks. We
validate our approach on MetaWorld, as well as a suite of diverse
drawer-opening tasks in IsaacLab. The resulting policy attains high performance
across all tasks while using substantially fewer expert demonstrations, and the
visual policy learned with our method in simulation shows better performance
than naive DAgger and Behavior Cloning when transferring zero-shot to a real
robot without using real data.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种端到端可微的共形预测框架，用于信号时序逻辑推理，同时提高公式的可靠性和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有STL推理方法缺乏对推断规则的正式置信保证，而传统共形预测通常作为后训练包装器使用，无法改进模型学习。

Method: 引入基于鲁棒性的非共形度分数，将平滑CP层直接嵌入训练过程，使用新的损失函数同时优化推理准确性和CP预测集。

Result: 实验显示该方法减少了预测不确定性（高覆盖率同时减小预测集大小），并提高了准确性（使用固定阈值时的误分类数量减少）。

Conclusion: 该方法为学习到的STL公式提供统计保证，在基准时间序列任务上优于现有最先进方法。

Abstract: Signal Temporal Logic (STL) inference seeks to extract human-interpretable
rules from time-series data, but existing methods lack formal confidence
guarantees for the inferred rules. Conformal prediction (CP) is a technique
that can provide statistical correctness guarantees, but is typically applied
as a post-training wrapper without improving model learning. Instead, we
introduce an end-to-end differentiable CP framework for STL inference that
enhances both reliability and interpretability of the resulting formulas. We
introduce a robustness-based nonconformity score, embed a smooth CP layer
directly into training, and employ a new loss function that simultaneously
optimizes inference accuracy and CP prediction sets with a single term.
Following training, an exact CP procedure delivers statistical guarantees for
the learned STL formulas. Experiments on benchmark time-series tasks show that
our approach reduces uncertainty in predictions (i.e., it achieves high
coverage while reducing prediction set size), and improves accuracy (i.e., the
number of misclassifications when using a fixed threshold) over
state-of-the-art baselines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有12导联ECG系统依赖笨重的多电极设置，限制了移动环境下的持续监测，而当前PPG方法由于缺乏导联间约束和时空依赖建模不足，无法重建多导联ECG。

Method: 提出P2Es人口统计感知扩散框架，包含前向过程的频域模糊和时间噪声干扰，反向过程的时间多尺度生成和频域去模糊，以及基于KNN聚类和对比学习的人口统计特异性ECG转换。

Result: 广泛的实验结果表明，P2Es在12导联ECG重建方面优于基线模型。

Conclusion: P2Es框架成功地从PPG信号生成了临床有效的12导联ECG，为移动心血管监测提供了可行解决方案。

Abstract: The 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) is the gold standard for cardiovascular
monitoring, offering superior diagnostic granularity and specificity compared
to photoplethysmography (PPG). However, existing 12-lead ECG systems rely on
cumbersome multi-electrode setups, limiting sustained monitoring in ambulatory
settings, while current PPG-based methods fail to reconstruct multi-lead ECG
due to the absence of inter-lead constraints and insufficient modeling of
spatial-temporal dependencies across leads. To bridge this gap, we introduce
P2Es, an innovative demographic-aware diffusion framework designed to generate
clinically valid 12-lead ECG from PPG signals via three key innovations.
Specifically, in the forward process, we introduce frequency-domain blurring
followed by temporal noise interference to simulate real-world signal
distortions. In the reverse process, we design a temporal multi-scale
generation module followed by frequency deblurring. In particular, we leverage
KNN-based clustering combined with contrastive learning to assign affinity
matrices for the reverse process, enabling demographic-specific ECG
translation. Extensive experimental results show that P2Es outperforms baseline
models in 12-lead ECG reconstruction.

Conclusion: PageANN通过页面节点图结构和优化的内存管理策略，有效解决了磁盘ANNS的性能瓶颈，为大规模向量搜索提供了高性能和可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search (ANNS), as the core of vector databases
(VectorDBs), has become widely used in modern AI and ML systems, powering
applications from information retrieval to bio-informatics. While graph-based
ANNS methods achieve high query efficiency, their scalability is constrained by
the available host memory. Recent disk-based ANNS approaches mitigate memory
usage by offloading data to Solid-State Drives (SSDs). However, they still
suffer from issues such as long I/O traversal path, misalignment with storage
I/O granularity, and high in-memory indexing overhead, leading to significant
I/O latency and ultimately limiting scalability for large-scale vector search.
  In this paper, we propose PageANN, a disk-based approximate nearest neighbor
search (ANNS) framework designed for high performance and scalability. PageANN
introduces a page-node graph structure that aligns logical graph nodes with
physical SSD pages, thereby shortening I/O traversal paths and reducing I/O
operations. Specifically, similar vectors are clustered into page nodes, and a
co-designed disk data layout leverages this structure with a merging technique
to store only representative vectors and topology information, avoiding
unnecessary reads. To further improve efficiency, we design a memory management
strategy that combines lightweight indexing with coordinated memory-disk data
allocation, maximizing host memory utilization while minimizing query latency
and storage overhead. Experimental results show that PageANN significantly
outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) disk-based ANNS methods, achieving
1.85x-10.83x higher throughput and 51.7%-91.9% lower latency across different
datasets and memory budgets, while maintaining comparable high recall accuracy.

TL;DR: 提出了Mole-PAIR方法，通过偏好优化提升分子基础模型在分布外数据上的可靠性，显著改善OOD检测能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 分子基础模型在分布外样本上不可靠，存在化学幻觉问题，限制了在药物发现等高风险领域的应用。

Method: 将OOD检测问题建模为对ID和OOD样本之间OOD亲和度的偏好优化，通过成对学习目标实现，本质上优化AUROC指标。

Result: 在五个真实分子数据集上的实验表明，该方法显著提升了现有分子基础模型的OOD检测能力，在大小、支架和测定分布偏移下AUROC分别提升45.8%、43.9%和24.3%。

Conclusion: Mole-PAIR是一个简单、即插即用的模块，可灵活集成到现有基础模型中，通过低成本的后训练提高其在OOD数据上的可靠性。

Abstract: Molecular foundation models are rapidly advancing scientific discovery, but
their unreliability on out-of-distribution (OOD) samples severely limits their
application in high-stakes domains such as drug discovery and protein design. A
critical failure mode is chemical hallucination, where models make
high-confidence yet entirely incorrect predictions for unknown molecules. To
address this challenge, we introduce Molecular Preference-Aligned Instance
Ranking (Mole-PAIR), a simple, plug-and-play module that can be flexibly
integrated with existing foundation models to improve their reliability on OOD
data through cost-effective post-training. Specifically, our method formulates
the OOD detection problem as a preference optimization over the estimated OOD
affinity between in-distribution (ID) and OOD samples, achieving this goal
through a pairwise learning objective. We show that this objective essentially
optimizes AUROC, which measures how consistently ID and OOD samples are ranked
by the model. Extensive experiments across five real-world molecular datasets
demonstrate that our approach significantly improves the OOD detection
capabilities of existing molecular foundation models, achieving up to 45.8%,
43.9%, and 24.3% improvements in AUROC under distribution shifts of size,
scaffold, and assay, respectively.

Conclusion: 世界模型在改善自主血管内导航方面具有潜力，为通用AI驱动机器人干预研究奠定基础

Abstract: Autonomous navigation for mechanical thrombectomy (MT) remains a critical
challenge due to the complexity of vascular anatomy and the need for precise,
real-time decision-making. Reinforcement learning (RL)-based approaches have
demonstrated potential in automating endovascular navigation, but current
methods often struggle with generalization across multiple patient vasculatures
and long-horizon tasks. We propose a world model for autonomous endovascular
navigation using TD-MPC2, a model-based RL algorithm. We trained a single RL
agent across multiple endovascular navigation tasks in ten real patient
vasculatures, comparing performance against the state-of-the-art Soft
Actor-Critic (SAC) method. Results indicate that TD-MPC2 significantly
outperforms SAC in multi-task learning, achieving a 65% mean success rate
compared to SAC's 37%, with notable improvements in path ratio. TD-MPC2
exhibited increased procedure times, suggesting a trade-off between success
rate and execution speed. These findings highlight the potential of world
models for improving autonomous endovascular navigation and lay the foundation
for future research in generalizable AI-driven robotic interventions.

Result: SD-FM在所有训练指标和推理预算约束下都优于FM和OT-FM，在多个数据集、无条件/条件生成以及使用均值流模型时都表现出更好的性能。

Conclusion: 半离散流匹配方法有效解决了最优传输流匹配的计算瓶颈问题，实现了更好的生成性能，为流匹配模型的实际应用提供了更高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Flow models parameterized as time-dependent velocity fields can generate data
from noise by integrating an ODE. These models are often trained using flow
matching, i.e. by sampling random pairs of noise and target points
$(\mathbf{x}_0,\mathbf{x}_1)$ and ensuring that the velocity field is aligned,
on average, with $\mathbf{x}_1-\mathbf{x}_0$ when evaluated along a segment
linking $\mathbf{x}_0$ to $\mathbf{x}_1$. While these pairs are sampled
independently by default, they can also be selected more carefully by matching
batches of $n$ noise to $n$ target points using an optimal transport (OT)
solver. Although promising in theory, the OT flow matching (OT-FM) approach is
not widely used in practice. Zhang et al. (2025) pointed out recently that
OT-FM truly starts paying off when the batch size $n$ grows significantly,
which only a multi-GPU implementation of the Sinkhorn algorithm can handle.
Unfortunately, the costs of running Sinkhorn can quickly balloon, requiring
$O(n^2/\varepsilon^2)$ operations for every $n$ pairs used to fit the velocity
field, where $\varepsilon$ is a regularization parameter that should be
typically small to yield better results. To fulfill the theoretical promises of
OT-FM, we propose to move away from batch-OT and rely instead on a semidiscrete
formulation that leverages the fact that the target dataset distribution is
usually of finite size $N$. The SD-OT problem is solved by estimating a dual
potential vector using SGD; using that vector, freshly sampled noise vectors at
train time can then be matched with data points at the cost of a maximum inner
product search (MIPS). Semidiscrete FM (SD-FM) removes the quadratic dependency
on $n/\varepsilon$ that bottlenecks OT-FM. SD-FM beats both FM and OT-FM on all
training metrics and inference budget constraints, across multiple datasets, on
unconditional/conditional generation, or when using mean-flow models.

Motivation: 在需要大量人机交互的语言任务中，为每个查询部署单一"最佳"模型成本高昂。训练高质量路由器的核心挑战是可靠监督数据的稀缺性。

Method: 将LLM路由器训练问题转化为因果推断框架，将响应评估机制视为治疗分配，开发了整合因果路由器训练框架来纠正偏好数据偏差。

Result: 数值实验表明，该方法能提供更准确的路由，并改善了成本与质量之间的权衡。

Conclusion: 基于因果推断的框架能有效解决偏好数据偏差问题，提高LLM路由器的性能和效率。

Abstract: In language tasks that require extensive human--model interaction, deploying
a single "best" model for every query can be expensive. To reduce inference
cost while preserving the quality of the responses, a large language model
(LLM) router selects the most appropriate model from a pool of candidates for
each query. A central challenge to training a high-quality router is the
scarcity of reliable supervision. Gold-standard data (e.g., expert-verified
labels or rubric-based scores) provide accurate quality evaluations of LLM
responses but are costly and difficult to scale. In contrast, preference-based
data, collected via crowdsourcing or LLM-as-a-judge systems, are cheaper and
more scalable, yet often biased in reflecting the true quality of responses. We
cast the problem of LLM router training with combined gold-standard and
preference-based data into a causal inference framework by viewing the response
evaluation mechanism as the treatment assignment. This perspective further
reveals that the bias in preference-based data corresponds to the well-known
causal estimand: the conditional average treatment effect. Based on this new
perspective, we develop an integrative causal router training framework that
corrects preference-data bias, address imbalances between two data sources, and
improve routing robustness and efficiency. Numerical experiments demonstrate
that our approach delivers more accurate routing and improves the trade-off
between cost and quality.

Conclusion: 结合主动学习的生成AI工作流能有效防止生成模型退化，显著提高高质量设计候选的识别效率。

Abstract: Generative AI poses both opportunities and risks for solving inverse design
problems in the sciences. Generative tools provide the ability to expand and
refine a search space autonomously, but do so at the cost of exploring
low-quality regions until sufficiently fine tuned. Here, we propose a queue
prioritization algorithm that combines generative modeling and active learning
in the context of a distributed workflow for exploring complex design spaces.
We find that incorporating an active learning model to prioritize top design
candidates can prevent a generative AI workflow from expending resources on
nonsensical candidates and halt potential generative model decay. For an
existing generative AI workflow for discovering novel molecular structure
candidates for carbon capture, our active learning approach significantly
increases the number of high-quality candidates identified by the generative
model. We find that, out of 1000 novel candidates, our workflow without active
learning can generate an average of 281 high-performing candidates, while our
proposed prioritization with active learning can generate an average 604
high-performing candidates.

Conclusion: FedIF为现实世界部署提供了一个实用、理论可靠且可扩展的联邦学习鲁棒聚合方案，是Shapley值方法的高效替代方案。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) faces persistent robustness challenges due to non-IID
data distributions and adversarial client behavior. A promising mitigation
strategy is contribution evaluation, which enables adaptive aggregation by
quantifying each client's utility to the global model. However,
state-of-the-art Shapley-value-based approaches incur high computational
overhead due to repeated model reweighting and inference, which limits their
scalability. We propose FedIF, a novel FL aggregation framework that leverages
trajectory-based influence estimation to efficiently compute client
contributions. FedIF adapts decentralized FL by introducing normalized and
smoothed influence scores computed from lightweight gradient operations on
client updates and a public validation set. Theoretical analysis demonstrates
that FedIF yields a tighter bound on one-step global loss change under noisy
conditions. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10 and Fashion-MNIST show that FedIF
achieves robustness comparable to or exceeding SV-based methods in the presence
of label noise, gradient noise, and adversarial samples, while reducing
aggregation overhead by up to 450x. Ablation studies confirm the effectiveness
of FedIF's design choices, including local weight normalization and influence
smoothing. Our results establish FedIF as a practical, theoretically grounded,
and scalable alternative to Shapley-value-based approaches for efficient and
robust FL in real-world deployments.

Motivation: ICRL能够在无参数更新的情况下适应分布外任务，但现有方法缺乏对适应过程安全性的考虑，需要在最大化奖励的同时控制成本。

Method: 在ICRL框架中引入约束马尔可夫决策过程，使智能体在适应过程中不仅考虑奖励最大化，还通过额外成本函数控制行为安全性，并能根据成本容忍度阈值主动调整行为策略。

Result: 智能体能够根据成本预算主动调整行为策略：成本预算较高时行为更激进，成本预算较低时行为更保守，实现了安全的适应过程。

Conclusion: 该方法成功地将安全性约束引入ICRL的适应过程，使智能体能够在无参数更新的情况下安全地适应新任务，并根据成本容忍度灵活调整行为策略。

Abstract: In-context reinforcement learning (ICRL) is an emerging RL paradigm where the
agent, after some pretraining procedure, is able to adapt to
out-of-distribution test tasks without any parameter updates. The agent
achieves this by continually expanding the input (i.e., the context) to its
policy neural networks. For example, the input could be all the history
experience that the agent has access to until the current time step. The
agent's performance improves as the input grows, without any parameter updates.
In this work, we propose the first method that promotes the safety of ICRL's
adaptation process in the framework of constrained Markov Decision Processes.
In other words, during the parameter-update-free adaptation process, the agent
not only maximizes the reward but also minimizes an additional cost function.
We also demonstrate that our agent actively reacts to the threshold (i.e.,
budget) of the cost tolerance. With a higher cost budget, the agent behaves
more aggressively, and with a lower cost budget, the agent behaves more
conservatively.

Conclusion: 机器学习和强化学习正在将经典的不精确求解器转变为更可扩展、鲁棒和自适应的现实世界优化框架。

Abstract: Black-box optimization (BBO) addresses problems where objectives are
accessible only through costly queries without gradients or explicit structure.
Classical derivative-free methods -- line search, direct search, and
model-based solvers such as Bayesian optimization -- form the backbone of BBO,
yet often struggle in high-dimensional, noisy, or mixed-integer settings.
  Recent advances use machine learning (ML) and reinforcement learning (RL) to
enhance BBO: ML provides expressive surrogates, adaptive updates, meta-learning
portfolios, and generative models, while RL enables dynamic operator
configuration, robustness, and meta-optimization across tasks.
  This paper surveys these developments, covering representative algorithms
such as NNs with the modular model-based optimization framework (mlrMBO),
zeroth-order adaptive momentum methods (ZO-AdaMM), automated BBO (ABBO),
distributed block-wise optimization (DiBB), partition-based Bayesian
optimization (SPBOpt), the transformer-based optimizer (B2Opt),
diffusion-model-based BBO, surrogate-assisted RL for differential evolution
(Surr-RLDE), robust BBO (RBO), coordinate-ascent model-based optimization with
relative entropy (CAS-MORE), log-barrier stochastic gradient descent (LB-SGD),
policy improvement with black-box (PIBB), and offline Q-learning with Mamba
backbones (Q-Mamba).
  We also review benchmark efforts such as the NeurIPS 2020 BBO Challenge and
the MetaBox framework. Overall, we highlight how ML and RL transform classical
inexact solvers into more scalable, robust, and adaptive frameworks for
real-world optimization.

*Lucia Quirke,Stepan Shabalin,Nora Belrose*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出二进制稀疏自编码器(BAEs)和二进制转码器(BTCs)，通过将激活值限制为0或1来提升特征的可解释性和单义性，但会增加重构误差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统稀疏自编码器中许多特征只在强激活时才可解释的问题，消除通过连续激活强度变化传递不可解释信息的问题。

Method: 使用二进制稀疏自编码器和二进制转码器，将所有激活值约束为二进制(0或1)，消除连续激活强度的变化。

Result: 二进制化显著提高了发现特征的可解释性和单义性，但增加了重构误差和不可解释的超高频特征数量。频率调整后，连续稀疏编码器的可解释性评分略优于二进制方法。

Conclusion: 多义性可能是神经网络激活的固有属性，二进制化虽然提升了某些方面的可解释性，但无法完全消除多义性问题。

Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) are used to decompose neural network activations
into sparsely activating features, but many SAE features are only interpretable
at high activation strengths. To address this issue we propose to use binary
sparse autoencoders (BAEs) and binary transcoders (BTCs), which constrain all
activations to be zero or one. We find that binarisation significantly improves
the interpretability and monosemanticity of the discovered features, while
increasing reconstruction error. By eliminating the distinction between high
and low activation strengths, we prevent uninterpretable information from being
smuggled in through the continuous variation in feature activations. However,
we also find that binarisation increases the number of uninterpretable
ultra-high frequency features, and when interpretability scores are
frequency-adjusted, the scores for continuous sparse coders are slightly better
than those of binary ones. This suggests that polysemanticity may be an
ineliminable property of neural activations.

*Yixuan Wang,Dan Guralnik,Saiedeh Akbari,Warren Dixon*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: EMP是一种与上下文无关、无需参数的剪枝规则，通过计算有效数量N_eff来确定保留多少参数，适用于各种剪枝标准和模型架构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决模型剪枝中的核心问题：应该保留多少参数？现有方法通常需要手动设置剪枝率或依赖特定上下文，缺乏通用性。

Method: 基于逆辛普森指数计算有效数量N_eff，保留得分最高的N_eff个参数，零化其余参数。该方法适用于权重大小、注意力分数、KAN重要性分数等各种评分标准。

Result: 在MLP、CNN、Transformer/LLM和KAN等模型上的实验表明，使用EMP剪枝的稀疏模型性能与原始密集网络相当。

Conclusion: EMP提供了一个通用、自适应的剪枝阈值，能够有效指导模型剪枝，在保持性能的同时实现参数稀疏化。

Abstract: We introduce Effective Model Pruning (EMP), a context-agnostic,
parameter-free rule addressing a fundamental question about pruning: how many
entries to keep. EMP does not prescribe how to score the parameters or prune
the models; instead, it supplies a universal adaptive threshold that can be
applied to any pruning criterion: weight magnitude, attention score, KAN
importance score, or even feature-level signals such as image pixel, and used
on structural parts or weights of the models. Given any score vector s, EMP
maps s to a built-in effective number N_eff which is inspired by the Inverse
Simpson index of contributors. Retaining the N_eff highest scoring entries and
zeroing the remainder yields sparse models with performance comparable to the
original dense networks across MLPs, CNNs, Transformers/LLMs, and KAN, in our
experiments. By leveraging the geometry of the simplex, we derive a tight lower
bound on the preserved mass s_eff (the sum of retained scores) over the
corresponding ordered probability simplex associated with the score vector s.
We further verify the effectiveness of N_eff by pruning the model with a scaled
threshold \b{eta}*N_eff across a variety of criteria and models. Experiments
suggest that the default \b{eta} = 1 yields a robust threshold for model
pruning while \b{eta} not equal to 1 still serves as an optional adjustment to
meet specific sparsity requirements.

TL;DR: T-BiGAN是一个结合窗口注意力Transformer和双向生成对抗网络的无监督异常检测框架，用于电力系统同步相量数据流的实时异常检测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 确保电网韧性需要及时无监督地检测同步相量数据流中的异常，传统方法依赖人工标注数据，难以适应实时监控需求。

Method: 采用自注意力编码器-解码器架构捕获电网复杂时空依赖关系，通过联合判别器强制执行循环一致性，使用自适应评分结合重构误差、潜在空间漂移和判别器置信度进行实时异常标记。

Result: 在硬件在环PMU基准测试中，T-BiGAN达到ROC-AUC 0.95和平均精度0.996，显著优于领先的有监督和无监督方法，特别擅长检测微妙的频率和电压偏差。

Conclusion: T-BiGAN证明了在不依赖人工标注故障数据的情况下，能够有效实现实时广域监控，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Ensuring power grid resilience requires the timely and unsupervised detection
of anomalies in synchrophasor data streams. We introduce T-BiGAN, a novel
framework that integrates window-attention Transformers within a bidirectional
Generative Adversarial Network (BiGAN) to address this challenge. Its
self-attention encoder-decoder architecture captures complex spatio-temporal
dependencies across the grid, while a joint discriminator enforces cycle
consistency to align the learned latent space with the true data distribution.
Anomalies are flagged in real-time using an adaptive score that combines
reconstruction error, latent space drift, and discriminator confidence.
Evaluated on a realistic hardware-in-the-loop PMU benchmark, T-BiGAN achieves
an ROC-AUC of 0.95 and an average precision of 0.996, significantly
outperforming leading supervised and unsupervised methods. It shows particular
strength in detecting subtle frequency and voltage deviations, demonstrating
its practical value for live, wide-area monitoring without relying on manually
labeled fault data.

*Zhendong Mi,Bian Sun,Grace Li Zhang,Shaoyi Huang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: D-Rank是一个基于SVD的LLM压缩框架，通过动态分层分配秩来优化压缩效果，考虑不同层的信息密度差异，在保持压缩率的同时显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有SVD压缩方法对所有层使用统一压缩率，忽视了LLM中不同层的信息密度差异（中间层信息更丰富，早期和晚期层更冗余），导致压缩效果不佳。

Method: 引入有效秩作为信息密度度量，使用拉格朗日乘子优化方案动态分配秩，对注意力层进行秩重平衡，并扩展到分组查询注意力的最新LLM。

Result: 在多种LLM和压缩率下，D-Rank始终优于SVD-LLM、ASVD和Basis Sharing方法，在20%压缩率下LLaMA-3-8B的困惑度降低15%以上，在40%压缩率下LLaMA-7B的零样本推理准确率提升5%，同时吞吐量更高。

Conclusion: D-Rank通过考虑层间异质性的动态秩分配策略，显著提升了SVD压缩的效果，为LLM的高效部署提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have rapidly scaled in size, bringing severe
memory and computational challenges that hinder their deployment. Singular
Value Decomposition (SVD)-based compression has emerged as an appealing
post-training compression technique for LLMs, yet most existing methods apply a
uniform compression ratio across all layers, implicitly assuming homogeneous
information included in various layers. This overlooks the substantial
intra-layer heterogeneity observed in LLMs, where middle layers tend to encode
richer information while early and late layers are more redundant. In this
work, we revisit the existing SVD-based compression method and propose D-Rank,
a framework with layer-wise balanced Dynamic Rank allocation for LLMs
compression. We first introduce effective rank as a principled metric to
measure the information density of weight matrices, and then allocate ranks via
a Lagrange multiplier-based optimization scheme to adaptively assign more
capacity to groups with higher information density under a fixed compression
ratio. Moreover, we rebalance the allocated ranks across attention layers to
account for their varying importance and extend D-Rank to latest LLMs with
grouped-query attention. Extensive experiments on various LLMs with different
scales across multiple compression ratios demonstrate that D-Rank consistently
outperforms SVD-LLM, ASVD, and Basis Sharing, achieving more than 15 lower
perplexity with LLaMA-3-8B model on C4 datasets at 20% compression ratio and up
to 5% higher zero-shot reasoning accuracy with LLaMA-7B model at 40%
compression ratio while achieving even higher throughput.

TL;DR: Swift是一个单步一致性模型，首次实现了基于连续排名概率评分（CRPS）的概率流模型自回归微调，无需多模型集成或参数扰动，在S2S天气预报中比最先进的扩散模型快39倍，预报技能与基于数值的IFS ENS相当。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型为概率天气预报提供了物理基础框架，但其在推理时依赖缓慢的迭代求解器，使得在次季节到季节（S2S）应用中不实用，因为S2S需要长提前期和领域驱动的校准。

Method: 引入Swift单步一致性模型，首次实现基于CRPS目标的概率流模型自回归微调，消除了多模型集成或参数扰动的需求。

Result: Swift生成具有技能的6小时预报，可稳定运行长达75天，比最先进的扩散基线快39倍，预报技能与基于数值的IFS ENS相当。

Conclusion: 这是向从中期到季节尺度的高效可靠集合预报迈出的一步。

Abstract: Diffusion models offer a physically grounded framework for probabilistic
weather forecasting, but their typical reliance on slow, iterative solvers
during inference makes them impractical for subseasonal-to-seasonal (S2S)
applications where long lead-times and domain-driven calibration are essential.
To address this, we introduce Swift, a single-step consistency model that, for
the first time, enables autoregressive finetuning of a probability flow model
with a continuous ranked probability score (CRPS) objective. This eliminates
the need for multi-model ensembling or parameter perturbations. Results show
that Swift produces skillful 6-hourly forecasts that remain stable for up to 75
days, running $39\times$ faster than state-of-the-art diffusion baselines while
achieving forecast skill competitive with the numerical-based, operational IFS
ENS. This marks a step toward efficient and reliable ensemble forecasting from
medium-range to seasonal-scales.

TL;DR: 本文研究了预条件处理如何影响特征学习和泛化性能，发现预条件器通过其度量定义的Gram矩阵控制输入信息，从而在特征学习中引入可控的谱偏置。研究表明，当这种谱偏置与教师模型的谱偏置对齐时，泛化性能显著提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预条件处理在机器学习中广泛用于加速经验风险的收敛，但其对期望风险的影响尚未充分探索。本文旨在研究预条件处理如何影响特征学习和泛化性能。

Method: 将预条件器实例化为输入协方差矩阵的p次幂，并在单索引教师模型框架下，分析指数p和教师与输入谱对齐对泛化的影响。从噪声鲁棒性、分布外泛化和前向知识迁移三个互补视角研究这些因素的相互作用。

Result: 学习到的特征表示密切反映了预条件器引入的谱偏置——偏好被强调的组件，对被抑制的组件表现出降低的敏感性。当这种谱偏置与教师模型的谱偏置对齐时，泛化性能显著增强。

Conclusion: 预条件处理通过Gram矩阵控制输入信息，在特征学习中引入可控的谱偏置。泛化性能的关键在于预条件器引入的谱偏置与教师模型谱偏置的对齐程度，这种对齐显著提升了模型的泛化能力。

Abstract: Preconditioning is widely used in machine learning to accelerate convergence
on the empirical risk, yet its role on the expected risk remains underexplored.
In this work, we investigate how preconditioning affects feature learning and
generalization performance. We first show that the input information available
to the model is conveyed solely through the Gram matrix defined by the
preconditioner's metric, thereby inducing a controllable spectral bias on
feature learning. Concretely, instantiating the preconditioner as the $p$-th
power of the input covariance matrix and within a single-index teacher model,
we prove that in generalization, the exponent $p$ and the alignment between the
teacher and the input spectrum are crucial factors. We further investigate how
the interplay between these factors influences feature learning from three
complementary perspectives: (i) Robustness to noise, (ii) Out-of-distribution
generalization, and (iii) Forward knowledge transfer. Our results indicate that
the learned feature representations closely mirror the spectral bias introduced
by the preconditioner -- favoring components that are emphasized and exhibiting
reduced sensitivity to those that are suppressed. Crucially, we demonstrate
that generalization is significantly enhanced when this spectral bias is
aligned with that of the teacher.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的DeepONets需要固定传感器配置且缺乏不确定性量化机制，而VIDON等扩展虽然放宽了传感器约束但仍无法处理不完整测量或随机算子带来的不确定性。

Method: 集成set transformer嵌入处理稀疏可变传感器位置，使用条件变分自编码器近似解算子的条件分布，通过最小化负ELBO实现不确定性估计。

Result: 在确定性和随机偏微分方程（包括Navier-Stokes方程）上的数值实验证明了该框架的鲁棒性和有效性。

Conclusion: UQ-SONet在保持预测精度的同时提供了原则性的不确定性估计，解决了现有算子学习方法在传感器灵活性和不确定性量化方面的局限性。

Abstract: Learning operators from data is central to scientific machine learning. While
DeepONets are widely used for their ability to handle complex domains, they
require fixed sensor numbers and locations, lack mechanisms for uncertainty
quantification (UQ), and are thus limited in practical applicability. Recent
permutationinvariant extensions, such as the Variable-Input Deep Operator
Network (VIDON), relax these sensor constraints but still rely on sufficiently
dense observations and cannot capture uncertainties arising from incomplete
measurements or from operators with inherent randomness. To address these
challenges, we propose UQ-SONet, a permutation-invariant operator learning
framework with built-in UQ. Our model integrates a set transformer embedding to
handle sparse and variable sensor locations, and employs a conditional
variational autoencoder (cVAE) to approximate the conditional distribution of
the solution operator. By minimizing the negative ELBO, UQ-SONet provides
principled uncertainty estimation while maintaining predictive accuracy.
Numerical experiments on deterministic and stochastic PDEs, including the
Navier-Stokes equation, demonstrate the robustness and effectiveness of the
proposed framework.

Motivation: 将确定性神经网络验证中的分支定界与预激活分裂框架扩展到概率验证场景。

Method: 通过分裂预激活将原问题迭代划分为子问题，利用线性边界传播计算边界来约束每个子问题的概率。

Result: 在未训练网络、MNIST和CIFAR-10模型以及VNN-COMP 2025基准测试中，在中等至高维输入问题上持续优于最先进方法。

Conclusion: BaB-prob方法在概率验证中表现出色，特别是对于中等至高维输入问题，证明了其有效性和优越性。

Abstract: Branch-and-bound with preactivation splitting has been shown highly effective
for deterministic verification of neural networks. In this paper, we extend
this framework to the probabilistic setting. We propose BaB-prob that
iteratively divides the original problem into subproblems by splitting
preactivations and leverages linear bounds computed by linear bound propagation
to bound the probability for each subproblem. We prove soundness and
completeness of BaB-prob for feedforward-ReLU neural networks. Furthermore, we
introduce the notion of uncertainty level and design two efficient strategies
for preactivation splitting, yielding BaB-prob-ordered and BaB+BaBSR-prob. We
evaluate BaB-prob on untrained networks, MNIST and CIFAR-10 models,
respectively, and VNN-COMP 2025 benchmarks. Across these settings, our approach
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in medium- to
high-dimensional input problems.

TL;DR: 提出PWMPR方法，通过从稀疏种子开始增长网络而非剪枝，自动发现网络的最佳密度，在较低成本下接近彩票假设的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有稀疏训练方法（迭代剪枝、动态稀疏训练、初始化剪枝）要么需要大量重训练成本，要么假设目标密度固定。需要一种能自动发现最佳密度的更高效方法。

Method: PWMPR方法从稀疏种子开始，基于路径核启发式分数添加边，通过随机化缓解瓶颈，使用逻辑拟合规则检测准确率平台期来停止增长。

Result: 在CIFAR、TinyImageNet和ImageNet上的实验显示，PWMPR以约1.5倍密集训练成本接近IMP彩票假设性能（虽然密度更高），显著低于IMP的3-4倍成本。

Conclusion: 基于增长的密度发现是一个有前景的范式，与剪枝和动态稀疏方法形成互补。

Abstract: The lottery ticket hypothesis suggests that dense networks contain sparse
subnetworks that can be trained in isolation to match full-model performance.
Existing approaches-iterative pruning, dynamic sparse training, and pruning at
initialization-either incur heavy retraining costs or assume the target density
is fixed in advance. We introduce Path Weight Magnitude Product-biased Random
growth (PWMPR), a constructive sparse-to-dense training paradigm that grows
networks rather than pruning them, while automatically discovering their
operating density. Starting from a sparse seed, PWMPR adds edges guided by
path-kernel-inspired scores, mitigates bottlenecks via randomization, and stops
when a logistic-fit rule detects plateauing accuracy. Experiments on CIFAR,
TinyImageNet, and ImageNet show that PWMPR approaches the performance of
IMP-derived lottery tickets-though at higher density-at substantially lower
cost (~1.5x dense vs. 3-4x for IMP). These results establish growth-based
density discovery as a promising paradigm that complements pruning and dynamic
sparsity.

TL;DR: NuRL是一种新的强化学习方法，通过自生成提示来提升LLM推理能力的上限，解决了传统RL方法无法从模型无法解决的问题中学习的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统在线强化学习方法如GRPO存在关键限制：无法从模型无法解决的问题中学习，导致模型的上限在RL训练后保持不变。

Method: 提出NuRL方法，让模型自生成提示（包含解决问题的核心知识），对通过率为0%的困难样本注入提示并重新生成轨迹，从而引入训练信号。

Result: NuRL在6个基准测试和3个模型上取得一致改进，能够提升模型的上限，而GRPO则无法改变pass@1024指标。

Conclusion: NuRL通过自生成提示有效提升了LLM推理能力的上限，最佳提示是抽象且高层次的，在GRPO收敛后必要使用时效果最好。

Abstract: Current online reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms like GRPO share a key
limitation in LLM reasoning: they cannot learn from problems that are
"unsolvable" to the model. In other words, they can only improve performance on
problems where the model is capable of exploring the correct answer.
Consequently, the model's "upper limit" remains unchanged after RL training,
even though the likelihood of solving easier, solvable problems may increase.
These hard samples cannot contribute to training, as no rollouts yield rewards
and thus no gradients are produced. To unlock learning from these hard samples,
we propose NuRL, a "nudging" method that aims to push the upper bound of LLM
reasoning using self-generated hints, i.e., abstract cues that help reduce the
problem difficulty for the model. Given a question and its gold answer, the
model generates a CoT and then produces a hint containing the core knowledge
needed to solve the problem. During training, we generate G rollouts from the
base policy and use the pass rate to decide whether the hint should be
injected. For hard samples with a 0% pass rate, we inject the hint and
regenerate a new batch of trajectories. This yields two benefits: (1) the hint
boosts pass rates (from 0% to non-zero), thereby introducing training signals
for previously unsolvable samples, and (2) the hints are self-generated,
avoiding distributional shift and do not rely on external models. NuRL achieves
consistent improvements across 6 benchmarks and 3 models, while remaining
complementary to test-time scaling. Notably, NuRL can raise the model's upper
limit, whereas GRPO leaves pass@1024 unchanged from the base model.
Furthermore, we present a systematic study of what makes an effective hint and
when hints are most useful. Interestingly, the best hints are abstract and
high-level, and are most beneficial when applied necessarily and after GRPO has
converged.

Conclusion: 提出的框架通过利用时序多模态交互来指导MoE路由，有效提升了多模态模型的性能和专家专业化能力

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures have become pivotal for large-scale
multimodal models. However, their routing mechanisms typically overlook the
informative, time-varying interaction dynamics between modalities. This
limitation hinders expert specialization, as the model cannot explicitly
leverage intrinsic modality relationships for effective reasoning. To address
this, we propose a novel framework that guides MoE routing using quantified
temporal interaction. A multimodal interaction-aware router learns to dispatch
tokens to experts based on the nature of their interactions. This dynamic
routing encourages experts to acquire generalizable interaction-processing
skills rather than merely learning task-specific features. Our framework builds
on a new formulation of temporal multimodal interaction dynamics, which are
used to guide expert routing. We first demonstrate that these temporal
multimodal interactions reveal meaningful patterns across applications, and
then show how they can be leveraged to improve both the design and performance
of MoE-based models. Comprehensive experiments on challenging multimodal
benchmarks validate our approach, demonstrating both enhanced performance and
improved interpretability.

Result: 生成了最小且忠实的解释，能够突出图像中决策关键区域，同时通过电路读取程序提供了对模型内部计算机制的理解。

Conclusion: 该方法在最小输入级解释和驱动模型决策的内部计算机制理解之间建立了实用的桥梁。

Abstract: Machine learning models, by virtue of training, learn a large repertoire of
decision rules for any given input, and any one of these may suffice to justify
a prediction. However, in high-dimensional input spaces, such rules are
difficult to identify and interpret. In this paper, we introduce an
activation-matching based approach to generate minimal and faithful
explanations for the decisions of pre-trained image classifiers. We aim to
identify minimal explanations that not only preserve the model's decision but
are also concise and human-readable. To achieve this, we train a lightweight
autoencoder to produce binary masks that learns to highlight the decision-wise
critical regions of an image while discarding irrelevant background. The
training objective integrates activation alignment across multiple layers,
consistency at the output label, priors that encourage sparsity, and
compactness, along with a robustness constraint that enforces faithfulness. The
minimal explanations so generated also lead us to mechanistically interpreting
the model internals. In this regard we also introduce a circuit readout
procedure wherein using the explanation's forward pass and gradients, we
identify active channels and construct a channel-level graph, scoring
inter-layer edges by ingress weight magnitude times source activation and

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于系数矩阵行向L∞范数的简约性正则化方法，通过鼓励整行系数消失来减少字典原子的使用数量，显著提升了重建质量和表示稀疏性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统字典学习主要关注单个样本的稀疏性，忽略了原子在样本间的共享模式，导致字典冗余和次优。需要一种能促进跨样本原子共享稀疏性的方法。

Method: 引入系数矩阵行向L∞范数作为正则化项，结合Beta-Bernoulli先验的概率模型，从贝叶斯角度解释正则化参数，并与最小描述长度、贝叶斯模型选择等理论建立联系。

Result: 在基准数据集上，该方法实现了重建质量显著提升（RMSE降低20%），表示稀疏性增强，仅使用不到十分之一的字典原子，验证了理论分析。

Conclusion: 提出的简约性正则化方法有效解决了传统字典学习的冗余问题，通过促进跨样本的原子共享稀疏性，实现了更优的字典学习和表示性能。

Abstract: Dictionary learning is traditionally formulated as an $L_1$-regularized
signal reconstruction problem. While recent developments have incorporated
discriminative, hierarchical, or generative structures, most approaches rely on
encouraging representation sparsity over individual samples that overlook how
atoms are shared across samples, resulting in redundant and sub-optimal
dictionaries. We introduce a parsimony promoting regularizer based on the
row-wise $L_\infty$ norm of the coefficient matrix. This additional penalty
encourages entire rows of the coefficient matrix to vanish, thereby reducing
the number of dictionary atoms activated across the dataset. We derive the
formulation from a probabilistic model with Beta-Bernoulli priors, which
provides a Bayesian interpretation linking the regularization parameters to
prior distributions. We further establish theoretical calculation for optimal
hyperparameter selection and connect our formulation to both Minimum
Description Length, Bayesian model selection and pathlet learning. Extensive
experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method achieves
substantially improved reconstruction quality (with a 20\% reduction in RMSE)
and enhanced representation sparsity, utilizing fewer than one-tenth of the
available dictionary atoms, while empirically validating our theoretical
analysis.

Motivation: 现有的主动测试时适应方法使用启发式不确定性度量，数据选择效率低，浪费人工标注预算。需要更原则性的不确定性度量方法。

Method: 使用平滑置信分数和top-K确定性度量，基于伪覆盖率的在线权重更新算法，域偏移检测器自适应人类监督，以及平衡人工标注和模型标注数据的分阶段更新方案。

Result: 在广泛实验中，CPATTA始终优于最先进的ATTA方法，准确率提升约5%。

Conclusion: CPATTA通过原则性的不确定性度量和高效的标注策略，显著提升了主动测试时适应的性能和数据效率。

Abstract: Active Test-Time Adaptation (ATTA) improves model robustness under domain
shift by selectively querying human annotations at deployment, but existing
methods use heuristic uncertainty measures and suffer from low data selection
efficiency, wasting human annotation budget. We propose Conformal Prediction
Active TTA (CPATTA), which first brings principled, coverage-guaranteed
uncertainty into ATTA. CPATTA employs smoothed conformal scores with a top-K
certainty measure, an online weight-update algorithm driven by pseudo coverage,
a domain-shift detector that adapts human supervision, and a staged update
scheme balances human-labeled and model-labeled data. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that CPATTA consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art ATTA
methods by around 5% in accuracy. Our code and datasets are available at

Motivation: 时间序列问答任务面临标注数据缺乏的挑战，而视觉语言模型在零样本分析时间序列信号方面显示出潜力，但可能产生错误标签。

Method: 利用视觉语言模型生成伪标签，基于深度神经网络对噪声标签的固有鲁棒性来训练时间序列问答模型。

Result: 实验结果表明，TSQA模型不仅能用伪标签成功训练，还能通过利用大量未标注数据超越VLM本身的性能。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了时间序列问答任务中标注数据不足的问题，通过伪标签训练实现了性能提升。

Abstract: Time-series question answering (TSQA) tasks face significant challenges due
to the lack of labeled data. Alternatively, with recent advancements in
large-scale models, vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated the
potential to analyze time-series signals in a zero-shot manner. In this paper,
we propose a training approach that uses pseudo labels generated by a VLM.
Although VLMs can produce incorrect labels, TSQA models can still be
effectively trained based on the property that deep neural networks are
inherently robust to such noisy labels. Our experimental results demonstrate
that TSQA models are not only successfully trained with pseudo labels, but also
surpass the performance of the VLM itself by leveraging a large amount of
unlabeled data.

Abstract: Accurate and physically feasible human motion prediction is crucial for safe
and seamless human-robot collaboration. While recent advancements in human
motion capture enable real-time pose estimation, the practical value of many
existing approaches is limited by the lack of future predictions and
consideration of physical constraints. Conventional motion prediction schemes
rely heavily on past poses, which are not always available in real-world
scenarios. To address these limitations, we present a physics-informed learning
framework that integrates domain knowledge into both training and inference to
predict human motion using inertial measurements from only 5 IMUs. We propose a
network that accounts for the spatial characteristics of human movements.
During training, we incorporate forward and differential kinematics functions
as additional loss components to regularize the learned joint predictions. At
the inference stage, we refine the prediction from the previous iteration to
update a joint state buffer, which is used as extra inputs to the network.
Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves high accuracy,
smooth transitions between motions, and generalizes well to unseen subjects

TL;DR: 提出了一种自适应图粗化方法，在训练过程中联合学习GNN参数并通过K-means聚类合并节点，以处理大规模图数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着现实世界图数据规模不断增大，直接处理变得越来越困难甚至不可行。为大规模数据定制算法可能会牺牲性能，因此考虑通过图缩减来减少训练期间使用的数据量。

Method: 同时训练GNN并通过基于节点嵌入的K-means聚类对图进行粗化，在训练过程中合并节点，使节点聚类能够适应学习任务而非仅依赖图连接性和特征。

Result: 在同性恋和异质性节点分类数据集上验证了该方法，可视化展示了节点嵌入与其对应聚类之间的关系，证明粗化图在训练过程中能够适应学习任务。

Conclusion: 该方法适用于其他方法难以处理的场景（如异质性数据），通过自适应图粗化有效处理大规模图数据，同时保持模型性能。

Abstract: We propose an adaptive graph coarsening method to jointly learn graph neural
network (GNN) parameters and merge nodes via K-means clustering during
training. As real-world graphs grow larger, processing them directly becomes
increasingly challenging and sometimes infeasible. Tailoring algorithms to
large-scale data may sacrifice performance, so we instead consider graph
reduction to decrease the amount of data used during training. In particular,
we propose a method to simultaneously train a GNN and coarsen its graph by
partitioning nodes via K-means clustering based on their embeddings. Unlike
past graph coarsening works, our approach allows us to merge nodes during
training. Not only does this preclude coarsening as a preprocessing step, but
our node clusters can adapt to the learning task instead of relying solely on
graph connectivity and features. Thus, our method is amenable to scenarios that
are challenging for other methods, such as heterophilic data. We validate our
approach on both homophilic and heterophilic node classification datasets. We
further visualize relationships between node embeddings and their corresponding
clusters to illustrate that our coarsened graph adapts to the learning task
during training.

TL;DR: 提出Expert Merging和Expert Merging++两种模型合并方法，通过层间系数学习和重要性引导分块，在无标签数据上实现多专家模型的高效合并。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有模型合并方法存在依赖手动调参、参数对齐而非任务行为对齐、忽略层间异质性等问题，需要更高效、可控的合并方案。

Method: Expert Merging：使用无标签校准数据学习层间系数，通过隐藏状态和对数对齐优化，加入正则化和任务加权损失。Expert Merging++：在基础上增加重要性引导分块，根据系数、任务向量和参数数量分配分块系数。

Result: 在MLLM（InternVL、Qwen2-VL）和LLM（Mistral）骨干网络上超越强基线方法，Expert Merging++在某些情况下甚至超过监督混合训练。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了无标签、参数高效且可扩展的多专家模型合并方案，适用于LLM和MLLM。

Abstract: Model merging, which combines multiple domain-specialized experts into a
single model, offers a practical path to endow Large Language Models (LLMs) and
Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) with broad capabilities without the
cost of joint training or serving many models. However, training-free methods
rely on hand-tuned coefficients, whereas training-based methods primarily align
parameters rather than downstream task behavior and typically treat all layers
uniformly, ignoring inter-layer heterogeneity. We introduce Expert Merging, a
training-light method that learns a small set of layer-wise coefficients using
only unlabeled calibration data. The coefficients are optimized to explicitly
align the merged model's hidden states and logits with those of the
corresponding experts, with a coefficient regularizer for stability and
task-weighted losses for controllable trade-offs. To capture inter-layer
variation, Expert Merging++ augments this design with importance-guided
chunking: a normalized layer-importance metric, derived from learned
coefficients, task-vector magnitudes, and parameter counts, allocates more
chunk-wise coefficients to high-importance layers while keeping low-importance
layers lightweight. The result is a label-free, parameter-efficient, and
scalable approach to multi-expert model merging across LLMs and MLLMs. Across
MLLM backbones (InternVL and Qwen2-VL) and the LLM backbone (Mistral), our
method surpasses strong training-free and training-based merging baselines,
with Expert Merging++ delivering further gains and, in some cases, even
exceeding supervised Mixture Training. The source code is available at

TL;DR: 提出了UOT-RFM框架，通过无标签的逆重加权策略解决流匹配在长尾分布中的多数类偏差问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准流匹配在长尾分布中会产生多数类偏差，导致少数类生成质量低且无法匹配真实类别比例

Method: 使用小批量不平衡最优传输构建条件向量场，通过基于目标分布与UOT边缘密度比的标签无关多数分数进行逆重加权

Result: 在长尾基准测试中优于现有流匹配基线，在平衡数据集上保持竞争力

Conclusion: UOT-RFM能够有效缓解多数类偏差，无需类别标签信息即可改善长尾分布生成质量

Abstract: Flow matching has recently emerged as a powerful framework for
continuous-time generative modeling. However, when applied to long-tailed
distributions, standard flow matching suffers from majority bias, producing
minority modes with low fidelity and failing to match the true class
proportions. In this work, we propose Unbalanced Optimal Transport Reweighted
Flow Matching (UOT-RFM), a novel framework for generative modeling under
class-imbalanced (long-tailed) distributions that operates without any class
label information. Our method constructs the conditional vector field using
mini-batch Unbalanced Optimal Transport (UOT) and mitigates majority bias
through a principled inverse reweighting strategy. The reweighting relies on a
label-free majority score, defined as the density ratio between the target
distribution and the UOT marginal. This score quantifies the degree of majority
based on the geometric structure of the data, without requiring class labels.
By incorporating this score into the training objective, UOT-RFM theoretically
recovers the target distribution with first-order correction ($k=1$) and
empirically improves tail-class generation through higher-order corrections ($k
> 1$). Our model outperforms existing flow matching baselines on long-tailed
benchmarks, while maintaining competitive performance on balanced datasets.

Result: 实验结果表明MuPlon优于现有方法，达到最先进性能

Conclusion: MuPlon通过因果干预策略有效解决了声明验证中的数据噪声和偏见问题，提升了验证可靠性

Abstract: As a critical task in data quality control, claim verification aims to curb
the spread of misinformation by assessing the truthfulness of claims based on a
wide range of evidence. However, traditional methods often overlook the complex
interactions between evidence, leading to unreliable verification results. A
straightforward solution represents the claim and evidence as a fully connected
graph, which we define as the Claim-Evidence Graph (C-E Graph). Nevertheless,
claim verification methods based on fully connected graphs face two primary
confounding challenges, Data Noise and Data Biases. To address these
challenges, we propose a novel framework, Multi-Path Causal Optimization
(MuPlon). MuPlon integrates a dual causal intervention strategy, consisting of
the back-door path and front-door path. In the back-door path, MuPlon dilutes
noisy node interference by optimizing node probability weights, while
simultaneously strengthening the connections between relevant evidence nodes.
In the front-door path, MuPlon extracts highly relevant subgraphs and
constructs reasoning paths, further applying counterfactual reasoning to
eliminate data biases within these paths. The experimental results demonstrate
that MuPlon outperforms existing methods and achieves state-of-the-art
performance.

Motivation: 现有基于序列模型的方法对回报到目标和成本到目标使用对称输入标记，忽略了它们的内在不对称性：回报到目标是灵活的性能目标，而成本到目标应该是严格的安全边界。这种对称条件化导致不可靠的约束满足。

Conclusion: 这项工作揭示了对称标记条件化的局限性，并为将序列模型应用于安全强化学习建立了新的理论和实践方法。

Abstract: Offline safe reinforcement learning aims to learn policies that satisfy
predefined safety constraints from static datasets. Existing
sequence-model-based methods condition action generation on symmetric input
tokens for return-to-go and cost-to-go, neglecting their intrinsic asymmetry:
return-to-go (RTG) serves as a flexible performance target, while cost-to-go
(CTG) should represent a rigid safety boundary. This symmetric conditioning
leads to unreliable constraint satisfaction, especially when encountering
out-of-distribution cost trajectories. To address this, we propose
Boundary-to-Region (B2R), a framework that enables asymmetric conditioning
through cost signal realignment . B2R redefines CTG as a boundary constraint
under a fixed safety budget, unifying the cost distribution of all feasible
trajectories while preserving reward structures. Combined with rotary
positional embeddings , it enhances exploration within the safe region.
Experimental results show that B2R satisfies safety constraints in 35 out of 38
safety-critical tasks while achieving superior reward performance over baseline
methods. This work highlights the limitations of symmetric token conditioning
and establishes a new theoretical and practical approach for applying sequence
models to safe RL. Our code is available at https://github.com/HuikangSu/B2R.

Abstract: Ship traffic is an increasing source of underwater radiated noise in coastal
waters, motivating real-time digital twins of ocean acoustics for operational
noise mitigation. We present a physics-guided probabilistic framework to
predict three-dimensional transmission loss in realistic ocean environments. As
a case study, we consider the Salish Sea along shipping routes from the Pacific
Ocean to the Port of Vancouver. A dataset of over 30 million source-receiver
pairs was generated with a Gaussian beam solver across seasonal sound speed
profiles and one-third-octave frequency bands spanning 12.5 Hz to 8 kHz. We
first assess sparse variational Gaussian processes (SVGP) and then incorporate
physics-based mean functions combining spherical spreading with
frequency-dependent absorption. To capture nonlinear effects, we examine deep
sigma-point processes and stochastic variational deep kernel learning. The
final framework integrates four components: (i) a learnable physics-informed
mean that represents dominant propagation trends, (ii) a convolutional encoder
for bathymetry along the source-receiver track, (iii) a neural encoder for
source, receiver, and frequency coordinates, and (iv) a residual SVGP layer
that provides calibrated predictive uncertainty. This probabilistic digital
twin facilitates the construction of sound-exposure bounds and worst-case
scenarios for received levels. We further demonstrate the application of the
framework to ship speed optimization, where predicted transmission loss
combined with near-field source models provides sound exposure level estimates
for minimizing acoustic impacts on marine mammals. The proposed framework
advances uncertainty-aware digital twins for ocean acoustics and illustrates
how physics-guided machine learning can support sustainable maritime
operations.

Abstract: Graph Contrastive Learning (GCL) has shown strong promise for unsupervised
graph representation learning, yet its effectiveness on heterophilic graphs,
where connected nodes often belong to different classes, remains limited. Most
existing methods rely on complex augmentation schemes, intricate encoders, or
negative sampling, which raises the question of whether such complexity is
truly necessary in this challenging setting. In this work, we revisit the
foundations of supervised and unsupervised learning on graphs and uncover a
simple yet effective principle for GCL: mitigating node feature noise by
aggregating it with structural features derived from the graph topology. This
observation suggests that the original node features and the graph structure
naturally provide two complementary views for contrastive learning. Building on
this insight, we propose an embarrassingly simple GCL model that uses a GCN
encoder to capture structural features and an MLP encoder to isolate node
feature noise. Our design requires neither data augmentation nor negative
sampling, yet achieves state-of-the-art results on heterophilic benchmarks with
minimal computational and memory overhead, while also offering advantages in
homophilic graphs in terms of complexity, scalability, and robustness. We
provide theoretical justification for our approach and validate its
effectiveness through extensive experiments, including robustness evaluations
against both black-box and white-box adversarial attacks.

Conclusion: RCU方法有效解决了连续遗忘过程中的累积灾难性效用损失问题，为大语言模型的安全漏洞缓解提供了新思路。

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) become increasingly prevalent, their security
vulnerabilities have already drawn attention. Machine unlearning is introduced
to seek to mitigate these risks by removing the influence of undesirable data.
However, existing methods not only rely on the retained dataset to preserve
model utility, but also suffer from cumulative catastrophic utility loss under
continuous unlearning requests. To solve this dilemma, we propose a novel
method, called Rotation Control Unlearning (RCU), which leverages the
rotational salience weight of RCU to quantify and control the unlearning degree
in the continuous unlearning process. The skew symmetric loss is designed to
construct the existence of the cognitive rotation space, where the changes of
rotational angle can simulate the continuous unlearning process. Furthermore,
we design an orthogonal rotation axes regularization to enforce mutually
perpendicular rotation directions for continuous unlearning requests,
effectively minimizing interference and addressing cumulative catastrophic
utility loss. Experiments on multiple datasets confirm that our method without
retained dataset achieves SOTA performance.

Motivation: 传统PPO-based RLHF训练存在效率问题：顺序多模型依赖和长尾响应长度导致训练瓶颈

Method: 引入两种新技术：1) 内部步骤重叠 - 流式传输上游模型输出，使下游模型能提前预填充；2) 跨步骤重叠 - 自适应超量提交提示，推迟长生成到后续步骤

Conclusion: OPPO是一个轻量级、模型无关的框架，只需少量代码修改即可集成到现有PPO实现中，有效解决RLHF训练效率问题

Abstract: Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)-based reinforcement learning from human
feedback (RLHF) is a widely adopted paradigm for aligning large language models
(LLMs) with human preferences. However, its training pipeline suffers from
substantial inefficiencies due to sequential multi-model dependencies (e.g.,
reward model depends on actor outputs) and long-tail response lengths, where a
few long responses straggle the stage completion. We present OPPO, a novel,
lightweight, and model-agnostic PPO-based RLHF framework that improves training
efficiency by overlapping pipeline execution. OPPO introduces two novel
techniques: (1) Intra-step overlap, which streams upstream model outputs (e.g.,
actor model) in right-sized chunks, enabling the downstream model (e.g.,
reward) to begin prefill while the upstream continues decoding; and (2)
Inter-step overlap, which adaptively overcommits a few prompts and defers long
generations to future steps, mitigating tail latency without discarding partial
work. OPPO integrates easily with existing PPO implementations with a few lines
of code change. Extensive evaluations show that OPPO accelerates PPO-based RLHF
training by $1.8 \times-2.8 \times$ and improves GPU utilization by $1.4
\times-2.1 \times$ without compromising training convergence.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界中的实体通常具有局部自主性，会以特征表示无法完全捕捉的方式覆盖预设的关联关系，这种自主性会显著改变聚类结果，影响下游的推理和决策。

Method: 结合强化学习与确定性退火过程，在退火早期促进探索，后期转向利用；提出自适应距离估计网络(ADEN)，这是一个基于transformer的注意力模型，学习实体与聚类代表之间的依赖关系。

Result: 即使没有明确的自主性模型，该框架也能获得接近真实情况的解决方案（差距约3-4%），而忽略自主性会导致更大的差距（约35-40%）。

Conclusion: 自主感知聚类框架能够有效捕捉数据动态，显著提高聚类性能，特别是在处理具有局部自主性的实体时表现优异。

Abstract: Clustering arises in a wide range of problem formulations, yet most existing
approaches assume that the entities under clustering are passive and strictly
conform to their assigned groups. In reality, entities often exhibit local
autonomy, overriding prescribed associations in ways not fully captured by
feature representations. Such autonomy can substantially reshape clustering
outcomes -- altering cluster compositions, geometry, and cardinality -- with
significant downstream effects on inference and decision-making. We introduce
autonomy-aware clustering, a reinforcement (RL) learning framework that learns
and accounts for the influence of local autonomy without requiring prior
knowledge of its form. Our approach integrates RL with a deterministic
annealing (DA) procedure, where, to determine underlying clusters, DA naturally
promotes exploration in early stages of annealing and transitions to
exploitation later. We also show that the annealing procedure exhibits phase
transitions that enable design of efficient annealing schedules. To further
enhance adaptability, we propose the Adaptive Distance Estimation Network
(ADEN), a transformer-based attention model that learns dependencies between
entities and cluster representatives within the RL loop, accommodates
variable-sized inputs and outputs, and enables knowledge transfer across
diverse problem instances. Empirical results show that our framework closely
aligns with underlying data dynamics: even without explicit autonomy models, it
achieves solutions close to the ground truth (gap ~3-4%), whereas ignoring
autonomy leads to substantially larger gaps (~35-40%). The code and data are
publicly available at https://github.com/salar96/AutonomyAwareClustering.

TL;DR: 提出一种双重乐观算法，用于在线学习中动态生成新动作的问题，平衡动作生成成本与潜在收益，在医疗问答数据集上验证了有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着生成式AI的发展，智能体可以在在线学习中动态创建新动作，但动作生成通常需要成本，需要平衡成本与潜在收益。现有方法难以处理利用、探索和创建之间的三角权衡关系。

Method: 提出双重乐观算法，使用下置信界(LCB)进行动作选择，使用上置信界(UCB)进行动作生成，以优化动作生成时机和选择策略。

Result: 在医疗问答数据集上的实证评估表明，该方法相比基线策略实现了更好的生成-质量权衡。理论分析证明算法达到了O(T^(d/(d+2))d^(d/(d+2)) + d√(TlogT))的最优遗憾界。

Conclusion: 该算法是首个为扩展动作空间在线学习提供次线性遗憾界的解决方案，有效解决了利用、探索和创建之间的权衡问题。

Abstract: With advances in generative AI, decision-making agents can now dynamically
create new actions during online learning, but action generation typically
incurs costs that must be balanced against potential benefits. We study an
online learning problem where an agent can generate new actions at any time
step by paying a one-time cost, with these actions becoming permanently
available for future use. The challenge lies in learning the optimal sequence
of two-fold decisions: which action to take and when to generate new ones,
further complicated by the triangular tradeoffs among exploitation, exploration
and $\textit{creation}$. To solve this problem, we propose a doubly-optimistic
algorithm that employs Lower Confidence Bounds (LCB) for action selection and
Upper Confidence Bounds (UCB) for action generation. Empirical evaluation on
healthcare question-answering datasets demonstrates that our approach achieves
favorable generation-quality tradeoffs compared to baseline strategies. From
theoretical perspectives, we prove that our algorithm achieves the optimal
regret of $O(T^{\frac{d}{d+2}}d^{\frac{d}{d+2}} + d\sqrt{T\log T})$, providing
the first sublinear regret bound for online learning with expanding action
spaces.

Abstract: Bridging information geometry with machine learning, this paper presents a
method for constructing neural networks intrinsically on statistical manifolds.
We demonstrate this approach by formulating a neural network architecture
directly on the lognormal statistical manifold. The construction is driven by
the Hamiltonian system that is equivalent to the gradient flow on this
manifold. First, we define the network's input values using the coordinate
system of this Hamiltonian dynamics, naturally embedded in the Poincare disk.
The core of our contribution lies in the derivation of the network's components
from geometric principles: the rotation component of the synaptic weight matrix
is determined by the Lie group action of SU(1,1) on the disk, while the
activation function emerges from the symplectic structure of the system. We
subsequently obtain the complete weight matrix, including its translation
vector, and the resulting output values. This work shows that the lognormal
manifold can be seamlessly viewed as a neural manifold, with its geometric
properties dictating a unique and interpretable neural network structure. The
proposed method offers a new paradigm for building learning systems grounded in
the differential geometry of their underlying parameter spaces.

Conclusion: 来自无物理预训练的表征为数据高效的算子学习提供了强大基础

Abstract: Industrial design evaluation often relies on high-fidelity simulations of
governing partial differential equations (PDEs). While accurate, these
simulations are computationally expensive, making dense exploration of design
spaces impractical. Operator learning has emerged as a promising approach to
accelerate PDE solution prediction; however, its effectiveness is often limited
by the scarcity of labeled physics-based data. At the same time, large numbers
of geometry-only candidate designs are readily available but remain largely
untapped. We propose a two-stage framework to better exploit this abundant,
physics-agnostic resource and improve supervised operator learning under
limited labeled data. In Stage 1, we pretrain an autoencoder on a geometry
reconstruction task to learn an expressive latent representation without PDE
labels. In Stage 2, the neural operator is trained in a standard supervised
manner to predict PDE solutions, using the pretrained latent embeddings as
inputs instead of raw point clouds. Transformer-based architectures are adopted
for both the autoencoder and the neural operator to handle point cloud data and
integrate both stages seamlessly. Across four PDE datasets and three
state-of-the-art transformer-based neural operators, our approach consistently
improves prediction accuracy compared to models trained directly on raw point
cloud inputs. These results demonstrate that representations from
physics-agnostic pretraining provide a powerful foundation for data-efficient
operator learning.

Conclusion: 通过显式建模干预后选择过程，可以超越传统的等价类限制，更准确地识别底层真实因果结构。

Abstract: Interventional causal discovery seeks to identify causal relations by
leveraging distributional changes introduced by interventions, even in the
presence of latent confounders. Beyond the spurious dependencies induced by
latent confounders, we highlight a common yet often overlooked challenge in the
problem due to post-treatment selection, in which samples are selectively
included in datasets after interventions. This fundamental challenge widely
exists in biological studies; for example, in gene expression analysis, both
observational and interventional samples are retained only if they meet quality
control criteria (e.g., highly active cells). Neglecting post-treatment
selection may introduce spurious dependencies and distributional changes under
interventions, which can mimic causal responses, thereby distorting causal
discovery results and challenging existing causal formulations. To address
this, we introduce a novel causal formulation that explicitly models
post-treatment selection and reveals how its differential reactions to
interventions can distinguish causal relations from selection patterns,
allowing us to go beyond traditional equivalence classes toward the underlying
true causal structure. We then characterize its Markov properties and propose a
Fine-grained Interventional equivalence class, named FI-Markov equivalence,
represented by a new graphical diagram, F-PAG. Finally, we develop a provably
sound and complete algorithm, F-FCI, to identify causal relations, latent
confounders, and post-treatment selection up to $\mathcal{FI}$-Markov
equivalence, using both observational and interventional data. Experimental
results on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our method
recovers causal relations despite the presence of both selection and latent
confounders.

from ECG signals, emphasizing diagnostic accuracy and interpretability using
Explainable AI. The proposed system integrates ensemble learning techniques,
i.e., an optimized Random Forest known as CardioForest, and models like XGBoost

available MIMIC-IV dataset. The testing was carried out with the assistance of
accuracy, balanced accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, ROC-AUC, and error
rate (RMSE, MAE) measures. In addition, SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations)
was used to ascertain model explainability and clinical relevance. The
CardioForest model performed best on all metrics, achieving a test accuracy of
94.95%, a balanced accuracy of 88.31%, and high precision and recall metrics.
SHAP analysis confirmed the model's ability to rank the most relevant ECG
features, such as QRS duration, in accordance with clinical intuitions, thereby
fostering trust and usability in clinical practice. The findings recognize
CardioForest as an extremely dependable and interpretable WCT detection model.
Being able to offer accurate predictions and transparency through
explainability makes it a valuable tool to help cardiologists make timely and
well-informed diagnoses, especially for high-stakes and emergency scenarios.

TL;DR: AR3PO是一种采样高效的RLVR算法，通过自适应采样和响应重用技术解决GRPO中的优势消失问题，在多个基准测试中优于GRPO，与DAPO性能相当但显著降低采样成本。


<details>

Motivation: 解决GRPO算法中当响应组内所有响应获得相同奖励时出现的优势消失问题，提高强化学习验证奖励（RLVR）的训练效率和性能。

Method: 提出自适应采样（动态为困难提示分配更多响应）和响应重用（利用先前生成的正确响应提供训练信号）两种新技术。

Result: 在7B和8B模型上，AR3PO一致优于GRPO，与DAPO相当或更好，采样成本降低高达4.2倍；在32B模型上，与DAPO性能相当但采样成本显著更低。

Conclusion: AR3PO通过自适应采样和响应重用有效解决了GRPO的优势消失问题，在保持高性能的同时大幅降低了采样成本，为RLVR训练提供了更高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved impressive reasoning performance,
with reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) emerging as a
standard paradigm for post-training. A representative algorithm, group relative
policy optimization (GRPO) (Shao et al., 2024), computes advantages by
normalizing outcome rewards within response groups, but suffers from a
vanishing advantage issue when all responses in a group receive identical
rewards. To address this issue, we propose Adaptive Rollout and Response Reuse
Policy Optimization (AR3PO), a sampling efficient RLVR algorithm that
introduces two novel techniques: adaptive rollout, which dynamically allocates
more responses to difficult prompts while saving computation on easier ones,
and response reuse, which leverages previously generated correct responses to
provide useful training signals. We compare AR3PO with strong RLVR baselines on
multiple representative benchmarks using two different families of base models.
Across the 7B and 8B models, AR3PO consistently outperforms GRPO and matches or
surpasses DAPO (Yu et al., 2025), reducing rollout cost by up to 4.2x. On the
larger 32B model, AR3PO achieves comparable performance to DAPO at similar
training steps while maintaining substantially lower rollout cost.

Motivation: 大语言模型在强化学习中表现优异，但完全释放其潜力需要中期训练阶段来识别有用的紧凑动作集，并支持快速在线选择。

Method: 提出RA3算法，通过推导序列变分下界，迭代发现时间一致的潜在结构，并在引导数据上进行微调。

Conclusion: 中期训练在决策空间紧凑且有效视野较短时最有效，强调在动作抽象空间而非原始动作空间操作的重要性。

Abstract: Large language models excel with reinforcement learning (RL), but fully
unlocking this potential requires a mid-training stage. An effective
mid-training phase should identify a compact set of useful actions and enable
fast selection among them through online RL. We formalize this intuition by
presenting the first theoretical result on how mid-training shapes
post-training: it characterizes an action subspace that minimizes both the
value approximation error from pruning and the RL error during subsequent
planning. Our analysis reveals two key determinants of mid-training
effectiveness: pruning efficiency, which shapes the prior of the initial RL
policy, and its impact on RL convergence, which governs the extent to which
that policy can be improved via online interactions. These results suggest that
mid-training is most effective when the decision space is compact and the
effective horizon is short, highlighting the importance of operating in the
space of action abstractions rather than primitive actions. Building on these
insights, we propose Reasoning as Action Abstractions (RA3), a scalable
mid-training algorithm. Specifically, we derive a sequential variational lower
bound and optimize it by iteratively discovering temporally-consistent latent
structures via RL, followed by fine-tuning on the bootstrapped data.
Experiments on code generation tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our
approach. Across multiple base models, RA3 improves the average performance on
HumanEval and MBPP by 8 and 4 points over the base model and the next-token
prediction baseline. Furthermore, RA3 achieves faster convergence and higher
asymptotic performance in RLVR on HumanEval+, MBPP+, LiveCodeBench, and
Codeforces.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界系统通常是去中心化和异步的，玩家可以随时加入或离开系统，且没有全局时钟，这带来了玩家行动协调困难和动态玩家数量检测成本高的挑战。

Method: 开发了一种算法，玩家在探索阶段均匀拉动臂以减少碰撞概率，同时以较小概率继续拉动其他玩家正在利用的臂来检测玩家离开。

Result: 算法实现了$\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{T \log T} + {\log T}/{\Delta^2})$的遗憾界，其中$\Delta$是任意两臂之间最小期望奖励差距。

Conclusion: 这是第一个在异步去中心化环境中的高效MP-MAB算法，实验验证了其有效性和鲁棒性，适用于现实场景。

Abstract: In recent years, multi-player multi-armed bandits (MP-MAB) have been
extensively studied due to their wide applications in cognitive radio networks
and Internet of Things systems. While most existing research on MP-MAB focuses
on synchronized settings, real-world systems are often decentralized and
asynchronous, where players may enter or leave the system at arbitrary times,
and do not have a global clock. This decentralized asynchronous setting
introduces two major challenges. First, without a global time, players cannot
implicitly coordinate their actions through time, making it difficult to avoid
collisions. Second, it is important to detect how many players are in the
system, but doing so may cost a lot. In this paper, we address the challenges
posed by such a fully asynchronous setting in a decentralized environment. We
develop a novel algorithm in which players adaptively change between
exploration and exploitation. During exploration, players uniformly pull their
arms, reducing the probability of collisions and effectively mitigating the
first challenge. Meanwhile, players continue pulling arms currently exploited
by others with a small probability, enabling them to detect when a player has
left, thereby addressing the second challenge. We prove that our algorithm
achieves a regret of $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{T \log T} + {\log T}/{\Delta^2})$,
where $\Delta$ is the minimum expected reward gap between any two arms. To the
best of our knowledge, this is the first efficient MP-MAB algorithm in the
asynchronous and decentralized environment. Extensive experiments further
validate the effectiveness and robustness of our algorithm, demonstrating its
applicability to real-world scenarios.

TL;DR: Kairos是一个灵活的时间序列基础模型框架，通过动态分块标记化和实例自适应位置嵌入，解决了传统时间序列模型在处理异构信息密度时的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 时间序列在不同时间段具有异构的信息密度，受系统状态和信号复杂度影响。现有时间序列基础模型采用非自适应处理流程，无法捕捉这种动态特性，特别是在零样本场景下面临显著挑战。

Result: 在两个常见的零样本基准测试（GIFT-Eval和时间序列库基准）上，Kairos以更少的参数实现了优越性能，在各种任务中持续超越现有方法。

Conclusion: Kairos通过自适应处理机制有效解决了时间序列异构信息密度的建模挑战，为零样本时间序列分析提供了更强大的基础模型框架。

Abstract: Time series foundation models (TSFMs) have emerged as a powerful paradigm for
time series analysis, driven by large-scale pretraining on diverse data
corpora. However, time series inherently exhibit heterogeneous information
density over time, influenced by system states and signal complexity,
presenting significant modeling challenges especially in a zero-shot scenario.
Current TSFMs rely on non-adaptive processing pipelines that fail to capture
this dynamic nature. For example, common tokenization strategies such as
fixed-size patching enforce rigid observational granularity, limiting their
ability to adapt to varying information densities. Similarly, conventional
positional encodings impose a uniform temporal scale, making it difficult to
model diverse periodicities and trends across series. To overcome these
limitations, we propose Kairos, a flexible TSFM framework that integrates a
dynamic patching tokenizer and an instance-adaptive positional embedding.
Kairos adaptively selects tokenization granularity and tailors positional
encodings to the unique characteristics of each time series instance. Trained
on a large-scale Predictability-Stratified Time Series (PreSTS) corpus
comprising over 300 billion time points and adopting a multi-patch prediction
strategy in the inference stage, Kairos achieves superior performance with much
fewer parameters on two common zero-shot benchmarks, GIFT-Eval and the
Time-Series-Library benchmark, consistently outperforming established methods
across diverse tasks. The project page is at

Motivation: 多模态模型常常过度依赖主导模态而无法达到最优性能，现有方法主要关注修改训练目标或优化过程，数据中心的解决方案尚未充分探索。

Method: 提出MIDAS方法：1）生成语义不一致的跨模态错位样本；2）使用单模态置信度进行标注；3）引入弱模态加权机制，动态增加最不自信模态的损失权重；4）提出难样本加权机制，优先处理语义模糊的错位样本。

Result: 在多个多模态分类基准测试上的实验表明，MIDAS在解决模态不平衡问题上显著优于相关基线方法。

Conclusion: MIDAS通过数据增强和加权机制有效解决了多模态模型中的模态不平衡问题，能够强制模型学习从矛盾信号中提取信息，充分利用较弱模态。

Abstract: Multimodal models often over-rely on dominant modalities, failing to achieve
optimal performance. While prior work focuses on modifying training objectives
or optimization procedures, data-centric solutions remain underexplored. We
propose MIDAS, a novel data augmentation strategy that generates misaligned
samples with semantically inconsistent cross-modal information, labeled using
unimodal confidence scores to compel learning from contradictory signals.
However, this confidence-based labeling can still favor the more confident
modality. To address this within our misaligned samples, we introduce
weak-modality weighting, which dynamically increases the loss weight of the
least confident modality, thereby helping the model fully utilize weaker
modality. Furthermore, when misaligned features exhibit greater similarity to
the aligned features, these misaligned samples pose a greater challenge,
thereby enabling the model to better distinguish between classes. To leverage
this, we propose hard-sample weighting, which prioritizes such semantically
ambiguous misaligned samples. Experiments on multiple multimodal classification
benchmarks demonstrate that MIDAS significantly outperforms related baselines
in addressing modality imbalance.

Motivation: 现有知识蒸馏方法存在softmax平滑导致logit信息丢失，以及直接logit蒸馏受限于logit平移不变性而限制解空间的问题。

Method: 提出CSD方法，通过离散分数匹配对齐学生和教师模型在所有词汇对上的相对logit差异，解决了自回归LLM中训练不稳定和二次复杂度问题。

Conclusion: CSD方法具有可扩展性和有效性，为LLM蒸馏提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) deliver remarkable performance but are costly to
deploy, motivating knowledge distillation (KD) for efficient inference.
Existing KD objectives typically match student and teacher probabilities via
softmax, which blurs valuable logit information. While direct logit
distillation (DLD) mitigates softmax smoothing, it fails to account for logit
shift invariance, thereby restricting the solution space. We propose Concrete
Score Distillation (CSD), a discrete score-matching objective that overcomes
both softmax-induced smoothing and restrictions on the optimal solution set. We
resolve the training instability and quadratic complexity of discrete
score-matching in autoregressive LLMs, and the resulting CSD objective aligns
relative logit differences across all vocabulary pairs between student and
teacher with flexible weighting. We provide both mode-seeking and mode-covering
instances within our framework and evaluate CSD on task-agnostic
instruction-following and task-specific distillation using GPT-2-1.5B,
OpenLLaMA-7B, and GEMMA-7B-IT. Experiments show that CSD consistently surpasses
recent KD objectives, achieves favorable fidelity-diversity trade-offs, and
yields complementary gains when combined with on-policy techniques,
demonstrating its scalability and effectiveness for LLM distillation.

TL;DR: 提出了一种面向模糊决策系统的空间感知可分性特征选择框架S²FS，通过整合标量距离和空间方向信息来联合考虑类内紧凑性和类间分离性，在分类准确率和聚类性能上优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有特征选择方法要么未能直接对齐评估标准与学习性能，要么仅依赖非方向性欧氏距离来捕捉决策类间关系，限制了决策边界的清晰度。实例的空间分布对决策边界清晰度有潜在影响。

Method: 提出S²FS框架，采用空间感知可分性准则，整合标量距离和空间方向信息来联合考虑类内紧凑性和类间分离性，使用前向贪婪策略迭代选择最具区分性的特征。

Result: 在10个真实数据集上的实验表明，S²FS在分类准确率和聚类性能上持续优于8种最先进的特征选择算法，特征可视化进一步证实了所选特征的可解释性。

Conclusion: S²FS通过空间感知可分性准则有效提升了模糊决策系统的特征选择性能，在保持可解释性的同时显著改善了预测性能。

Abstract: Feature selection is crucial for fuzzy decision systems (FDSs), as it
identifies informative features and eliminates rule redundancy, thereby
enhancing predictive performance and interpretability. Most existing methods
either fail to directly align evaluation criteria with learning performance or
rely solely on non-directional Euclidean distances to capture relationships
among decision classes, which limits their ability to clarify decision
boundaries. However, the spatial distribution of instances has a potential
impact on the clarity of such boundaries. Motivated by this, we propose
Spatially-aware Separability-driven Feature Selection (S$^2$FS), a novel
framework for FDSs guided by a spatially-aware separability criterion. This
criterion jointly considers within-class compactness and between-class
separation by integrating scalar-distances with spatial directional
information, providing a more comprehensive characterization of class
structures. S$^2$FS employs a forward greedy strategy to iteratively select the
most discriminative features. Extensive experiments on ten real-world datasets
demonstrate that S$^2$FS consistently outperforms eight state-of-the-art
feature selection algorithms in both classification accuracy and clustering
performance, while feature visualizations further confirm the interpretability
of the selected features.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于背包问题的最优探索预算分配方法，通过自适应分配计算资源来提升LLM自我改进的效率，解决了传统均匀分配导致的梯度消失问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统均匀探索预算分配存在边缘问题：简单任务总是成功而困难任务总是失败，两者在GRPO训练中都产生零梯度，影响学习效果。

Method: 将每个任务的探索视为具有不同"价值"和"成本"的"物品"，建立与经典背包问题的联系，推导出基于模型当前学习状态的自适应资源分配规则。

Result: 在GRPO中，非零策略梯度的有效比例提高了20-40%；在数学推理基准测试中平均提升2-4分，特定任务峰值提升9分；相比传统均匀分配节省约2倍计算资源。

Conclusion: 该方法作为计算"免费午餐"，能够将饱和任务的探索预算重新分配到最有影响力的任务上，显著提升了LLM自我改进的效率和效果。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) can self-improve through reinforcement learning,
where they generate trajectories to explore and discover better solutions.
However, this exploration process is computationally expensive, often forcing
current methods to assign limited exploration budgets to each task. This
uniform allocation creates problematic edge cases: easy tasks consistently
succeed while difficult tasks consistently fail, both producing zero gradients
during training updates for the widely used Group Relative Policy Optimization
(GRPO). We address this problem from the lens of exploration budget allocation.
Viewing each task's exploration as an "item" with a distinct "value" and
"cost", we establish a connection to the classical knapsack problem. This
formulation allows us to derive an optimal assignment rule that adaptively
distributes resources based on the model's current learning status. When
applied to GRPO, our method increases the effective ratio of non-zero policy
gradients by 20-40% during training. Acting as a computational "free lunch",
our approach could reallocate exploration budgets from tasks where learning is
saturated to those where it is most impactful. This enables significantly
larger budgets (e.g., 93 rollouts) for especially challenging problems, which
would be computationally prohibitive under a uniform allocation. These
improvements translate to meaningful gains on mathematical reasoning
benchmarks, with average improvements of 2-4 points and peak gains of 9 points
on specific tasks. Notably, achieving comparable performance with traditional
homogeneous allocation would require about 2x the computational resources.

TL;DR: 提出基于强化学习的数据选择方法，在仅使用5%训练数据的情况下，性能优于全数据微调，同时减少训练时间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLM微调中的数据选择问题，将其建模为预算约束优化问题，现有方法在微调场景下效果不佳。

Method: 将数据选择问题重新表述为马尔可夫决策过程，使用强化学习方法训练智能体学习最优数据选择策略，基于代理模型奖励信号。

Result: 在四个数据集上，使用5%数据选择的性能匹配或优于全数据微调，准确率提升高达10.8个百分点，训练时间减少2倍。

Conclusion: 强化学习指导的数据选择方法具有巨大潜力，能够在严格数据预算下最大化模型性能。

Abstract: Data selection for finetuning Large Language Models (LLMs) can be framed as a
budget-constrained optimization problem: maximizing a model's downstream
performance under a strict training data budget. Solving this problem is
generally intractable, and existing approximate approaches are
pretraining-oriented and transfer poorly to the fine-tuning setting. We
reformulate this problem as a tractable Markov Decision Process (MDP) and train
agents using various Reinforcement Learning (RL) methods to learn optimal data
selection policies, guided by an efficient, proxy-model-based reward signal.
Across four datasets, training on a $5\%$ subset selected by our approach
matches or outperforms fine-tuning on the full dataset by up to $10.8$ accuracy
points, while cutting wall-clock training time by up to $2 \times$,
highlighting the promise of RL-guided data selection.

TL;DR: ExploRLer是一个可插拔的管道，通过系统性地探索策略梯度方法中未探索的邻域区域，在不增加梯度更新次数的情况下显著提升连续控制环境中的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的策略梯度方法（如PPO）通常沿着单一随机梯度方向更新，忽略了参数空间的丰富局部结构。研究发现替代梯度与真实奖励地形相关性较差，而更高性能的解往往位于附近未探索区域。

Method: 提出ExploRLer管道，与PPO、TRPO等在线策略算法无缝集成，系统性地探测替代在线策略梯度更新的未探索邻域。通过可视化策略检查点所跨越的参数空间来识别高性能区域。

Result: 在不增加梯度更新次数的情况下，ExploRLer在复杂连续控制环境中相比基线方法取得了显著改进。

Conclusion: 迭代级探索为加强在线策略强化学习提供了一种实用有效的方法，并为替代目标的局限性提供了新的视角。

Abstract: Policy-gradient methods such as Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) are
typically updated along a single stochastic gradient direction, leaving the
rich local structure of the parameter space unexplored. Previous work has shown
that the surrogate gradient is often poorly correlated with the true reward
landscape. Building on this insight, we visualize the parameter space spanned
by policy checkpoints within an iteration and reveal that higher performing
solutions often lie in nearby unexplored regions. To exploit this opportunity,
we introduce ExploRLer, a pluggable pipeline that seamlessly integrates with
on-policy algorithms such as PPO and TRPO, systematically probing the
unexplored neighborhoods of surrogate on-policy gradient updates. Without
increasing the number of gradient updates, ExploRLer achieves significant
improvements over baselines in complex continuous control environments. Our
results demonstrate that iteration-level exploration provides a practical and
effective way to strengthen on-policy reinforcement learning and offer a fresh
perspective on the limitations of the surrogate objective.

TL;DR: 提出MS-PAFL框架，通过模型分割和隐私放大技术，在联邦学习中实现更好的隐私-效用权衡，减少差分隐私噪声对模型精度的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦学习中差分隐私保护会因添加噪声而显著降低模型精度，需要解决隐私保护与模型效用之间的矛盾。

Method: 将客户端模型分割为私有子模型（本地保留）和公共子模型（全局聚合），仅在公共子模型注入校准高斯噪声，结合随机客户端参与和本地数据子采样实现隐私放大。

Result: 理论分析表明MS-PAFL显著减少满足目标隐私保护水平所需的噪声，实验验证其能获得优越的隐私-效用权衡，在强隐私保证下训练高精度模型。

Conclusion: MS-PAFL框架通过模型分割和隐私放大技术，有效解决了联邦学习中差分隐私保护与模型精度之间的权衡问题。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) often adopts differential privacy (DP) to protect
client data, but the added noise required for privacy guarantees can
substantially degrade model accuracy. To resolve this challenge, we propose
model-splitting privacy-amplified federated learning (MS-PAFL), a novel
framework that combines structural model splitting with statistical privacy
amplification. In this framework, each client's model is partitioned into a
private submodel, retained locally, and a public submodel, shared for global
aggregation. The calibrated Gaussian noise is injected only into the public
submodel, thereby confining its adverse impact while preserving the utility of
the local model. We further present a rigorous theoretical analysis that
characterizes the joint privacy amplification achieved through random client
participation and local data subsampling under this architecture. The analysis
provides tight bounds on both single-round and total privacy loss,
demonstrating that MS-PAFL significantly reduces the noise necessary to satisfy
a target privacy protection level. Extensive experiments validate our
theoretical findings, showing that MS-PAFL consistently attains a superior
privacy-utility trade-off and enables the training of highly accurate models
under strong privacy guarantees.

Abstract: Neural Forecasters (NFs) are a cornerstone of Long-term Time Series
Forecasting (LTSF). However, progress has been hampered by an overemphasis on
architectural complexity at the expense of fundamental forecasting principles.
In this work, we return to first principles to redesign the LTSF paradigm. We
begin by introducing a Multiple Neural Forecasting Theorem that provides a
theoretical basis for our approach. We propose Boosted Direct Output (BDO), a
novel forecasting strategy that synergistically combines the advantages of both
Auto-Regressive (AR) and Direct Output (DO). In addition, we stabilize the
learning process by smoothly tracking the model's parameters. Extensive
experiments show that these principled improvements enable a simple MLP to
achieve state-of-the-art performance, outperforming recent, complex models in
nearly all cases, without any specific considerations in the area. Finally, we
empirically verify our theorem, establishing a dynamic performance bound and
identifying promising directions for future research. The code for review is

Abstract: Differentiable Logic Gate Networks (DLGNs) are a very fast and
energy-efficient alternative to conventional feed-forward networks. With
learnable combinations of logical gates, DLGNs enable fast inference by
hardware-friendly execution. Since the concept of DLGNs has only recently
gained attention, these networks are still in their developmental infancy,
including the design and scalability of their output layer. To date, this
architecture has primarily been tested on datasets with up to ten classes.
  This work examines the behavior of DLGNs on large multi-class datasets. We
investigate its general expressiveness, its scalability, and evaluate
alternative output strategies. Using both synthetic and real-world datasets, we
provide key insights into the importance of temperature tuning and its impact
on output layer performance. We evaluate conditions under which the Group-Sum
layer performs well and how it can be applied to large-scale classification of
up to 2000 classes.

Abstract: Simultaneously optimizing multiple, frequently conflicting, molecular
properties is a key bottleneck in the development of novel therapeutics.
Although a promising approach, the efficacy of multi-task learning is often
compromised by destructive gradient interference, especially in the data-scarce
regimes common to drug discovery. To address this, we propose AIM, an
optimization framework that learns a dynamic policy to mediate gradient
conflicts. The policy is trained jointly with the main network using a novel
augmented objective composed of dense, differentiable regularizers. This
objective guides the policy to produce updates that are geometrically stable
and dynamically efficient, prioritizing progress on the most challenging tasks.
We demonstrate that AIM achieves statistically significant improvements over
multi-task baselines on subsets of the QM9 and targeted protein degraders
benchmarks, with its advantage being most pronounced in data-scarce regimes.
Beyond performance, AIM's key contribution is its interpretability; the learned
policy matrix serves as a diagnostic tool for analyzing inter-task
relationships. This combination of data-efficient performance and diagnostic
insight highlights the potential of adaptive optimizers to accelerate
scientific discovery by creating more robust and insightful models for
multi-property molecular design.

Abstract: Autonomous Raman instruments on Mars rovers, deep-sea landers, and field
robots must interpret raw spectra distorted by fluorescence baselines, peak
shifts, and limited ground-truth labels. Using curated subsets of the RRUFF
database, we evaluate one-dimensional convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and
report four advances: (i) Baseline-independent classification: compact CNNs
surpass $k$-nearest-neighbors and support-vector machines on handcrafted
features, removing background-correction and peak-picking stages while ensuring
reproducibility through released data splits and scripts. (ii)
Pooling-controlled robustness: tuning a single pooling parameter accommodates
Raman shifts up to $30 \,\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$, balancing translational invariance
with spectral resolution. (iii) Label-efficient learning: semi-supervised
generative adversarial networks and contrastive pretraining raise accuracy by
up to $11\%$ with only $10\%$ labels, valuable for autonomous deployments with
scarce annotation. (iv) Constant-time adaptation: freezing the CNN backbone and
retraining only the softmax layer transfers models to unseen minerals at
$\mathcal{O}(1)$ cost, outperforming Siamese networks on resource-limited
processors. This workflow, which involves training on raw spectra, tuning
pooling, adding semi-supervision when labels are scarce, and fine-tuning
lightly for new targets, provides a practical path toward robust, low-footprint
Raman classification in autonomous exploration.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) is a distributed learning paradigm across multiple
entities while preserving data privacy. However, with the continuous emergence
of new data and increasing model diversity, traditional federated learning
faces significant challenges, including inherent issues of data heterogeneity,
model heterogeneity and catastrophic forgetting, along with new challenge of
knowledge misalignment. In this study, we introduce FedDCL, a novel framework
designed to enable data-free continual learning of the server model in a
model-heterogeneous federated setting. We leverage pre-trained diffusion models
to extract lightweight class-specific prototypes, which confer a threefold
data-free advantage, enabling: (1) generation of synthetic data for the current
task to augment training and counteract non-IID data distributions; (2)
exemplar-free generative replay for retaining knowledge from previous tasks;
and (3) data-free dynamic knowledge transfer from heterogeneous clients to the
server. Experimental results on various datasets demonstrate the effectiveness
of FedDCL, showcasing its potential to enhance the generalizability and
practical applicability of federated learning in dynamic settings.

Conclusion: 通过结合泛化理论和认证鲁棒性分析，本文为平滑多数投票分类器提供了理论保证，并提出了有效的谱正则化方法来增强其鲁棒性。

Abstract: Within the PAC-Bayesian framework, the Gibbs classifier (defined on a
posterior $Q$) and the corresponding $Q$-weighted majority vote classifier are
commonly used to analyze the generalization performance. However, there exists
a notable lack in theoretical research exploring the certified robustness of
majority vote classifier and its interplay with generalization. In this study,
we develop a generalization error bound that possesses a certified robust
radius for the smoothed majority vote classifier (i.e., the $Q$-weighted
majority vote classifier with smoothed inputs); In other words, the
generalization bound holds under any data perturbation within the certified
robust radius. As a byproduct, we find that the underpinnings of both the
generalization bound and the certified robust radius draw, in part, upon weight
spectral norm, which thereby inspires the adoption of spectral regularization
in smooth training to boost certified robustness. Utilizing the
dimension-independent property of spherical Gaussian inputs in smooth training,
we propose a novel and inexpensive spectral regularizer to enhance the smoothed
majority vote classifier. In addition to the theoretical contribution, a set of
empirical results is provided to substantiate the effectiveness of our proposed
method.

Abstract: The Quantum Schr\"odinger Bridge Problem (QSBP) describes the evolution of a
stochastic process between two arbitrary probability distributions, where the
dynamics are governed by the Schr\"odinger equation rather than by the
traditional real-valued wave equation. Although the QSBP is known in the
mathematical literature, we formulate it here from a Lagrangian perspective and
derive its main features in a way that is particularly suited to generative
modeling. We show that the resulting evolution equations involve the so-called
Bohm (quantum) potential, representing a notion of non-locality in the
stochastic process. This distinguishes the QSBP from classical stochastic
dynamics and reflects a key characteristic typical of quantum mechanical
systems. In this work, we derive exact closed-form solutions for the QSBP
between Gaussian distributions. Our derivation is based on solving the
Fokker-Planck Equation (FPE) and the Hamilton-Jacobi Equation (HJE) arising
from the Lagrangian formulation of dynamical Optimal Transport. We find that,
similar to the classical Schr\"odinger Bridge Problem, the solution to the QSBP
between Gaussians is again a Gaussian process; however, the evolution of the
covariance differs due to quantum effects. Leveraging these explicit solutions,
we present a modified algorithm based on a Gaussian Mixture Model framework,
and demonstrate its effectiveness across several experimental settings,
including single-cell evolution data, image generation, molecular translation
and applications in Mean-Field Games.

Abstract: Sparsity-aware training is an effective approach for transforming large
language models (LLMs) into hardware-friendly sparse patterns, thereby reducing
latency and memory consumption during inference. In this paper, we propose
Continuous Adaptive Sparse Trainer (CAST), a fully continuous and
differentiable sparsity-aware training framework for semi-structured (or "N:M")
sparse models. Unlike previous approaches that optimize sparsity patterns and
weights separately, CAST enables seamless joint optimization during training,
while progressively transforming the model into the desired sparsity format.
Specifically, CAST introduces three key components: 1) AdamS, a sparsity-aware
optimizer that leverages adaptive L1 decay to promote uniform sparsification
across all parameters; 2) Weight Scaling, a module designed to mitigate the
magnitude reduction caused by decay while preserving desired sparsity patterns;
3) Knowledge Distillation, which employs the dense model as a self-teacher to
enhance training efficiency. We evaluate CAST under 2:4 sparsity patterns
across multiple model families, ranging from 125M to 13B parameters. Our
results demonstrate significant improvements over previous state-of-the-art
methods in both perplexity and zero-shot accuracy with minimal training
resources. Notably, on LLaMA2-7B, our 2:4 sparse model achieves a negligible
perplexity increase of 0.09 and a 0.36% gain in zero-shot accuracy compared to
the dense model using only 2% of the original pretraining tokens. Additionally,
we establish an accurate and robust empirical scaling law to predict sparse
model performance given adequate training resources. Finally, we demonstrate
the practical applicability of our sparse models by evaluating them under
quantization and fine-tuning scenarios.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning in partially observable environments requires agents
to act under uncertainty from noisy, incomplete observations. Asymmetric
actor-critic methods leverage privileged information during training to improve
learning under these conditions. However, existing approaches typically assume
full-state access during training. In this work, we challenge this assumption
by proposing a novel actor-critic framework, called informed asymmetric
actor-critic, that enables conditioning the critic on arbitrary privileged
signals without requiring access to the full state. We show that policy
gradients remain unbiased under this formulation, extending the theoretical
foundation of asymmetric methods to the more general case of privileged partial
information. To quantify the impact of such signals, we propose informativeness
measures based on kernel methods and return prediction error, providing
practical tools for evaluating training-time signals. We validate our approach
empirically on benchmark navigation tasks and synthetic partially observable
environments, showing that our informed asymmetric method improves learning
efficiency and value estimation when informative privileged inputs are
available. Our findings challenge the necessity of full-state access and open
new directions for designing asymmetric reinforcement learning methods that are
both practical and theoretically sound.

Abstract: The attention mechanism has become a cornerstone of modern deep learning
architectures, where keys and values are typically derived from the same
underlying sequence or representation. This work explores a less conventional
scenario, when keys and values originate from different sequences or
modalities. Specifically, we first analyze the attention mechanism's behavior
under noisy value features, establishing a critical noise threshold beyond
which signal degradation becomes significant. Furthermore, we model context
(key, value) misalignment as an effective form of structured noise within the
value features, demonstrating that the noise induced by such misalignment can
substantially exceed this critical threshold, thereby compromising standard
attention's efficacy. Motivated by this, we introduce Indirect Attention, a
modified attention mechanism that infers relevance indirectly in scenarios with
misaligned context. We evaluate the performance of Indirect Attention across a
range of synthetic tasks and real world applications, showcasing its superior
ability to handle misalignment.

Abstract: Access to credible sustainability information in the fashion industry remains
limited and challenging to interpret, despite growing public and regulatory
demands for transparency. General-purpose language models often lack
domain-specific knowledge and tend to "hallucinate", which is particularly
harmful for fields where factual correctness is crucial. This work explores how
Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques can be applied to classify
sustainability data for fashion brands, thereby addressing the scarcity of
credible and accessible information in this domain. We present a prototype
Fashion Information Tool for Sustainability (FITS), a transformer-based system
that extracts and classifies sustainability information from credible,
unstructured text sources: NGO reports and scientific publications. Several
BERT-based language models, including models pretrained on scientific and
climate-specific data, are fine-tuned on our curated corpus using a
domain-specific classification schema, with hyperparameters optimized via
Bayesian optimization. FITS allows users to search for relevant data, analyze
their own data, and explore the information via an interactive interface. We
evaluated FITS in two focus groups of potential users concerning usability,
visual design, content clarity, possible use cases, and desired features. Our
results highlight the value of domain-adapted NLP in promoting informed
decision-making and emphasize the broader potential of AI applications in
addressing climate-related challenges. Finally, this work provides a valuable
dataset, the SustainableTextileCorpus, along with a methodology for future
updates. Code available at https://github.com/daphne12345/FITS

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Muon优化器在训练大语言模型时比Adam更快，其成功机制源于对关联记忆参数（VO注意力权重和FFN）的优化，以及在重尾数据分布下对尾部类别的更有效学习。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解Muon优化器为何在训练LLMs时比Adam更快的机制，特别是其在重尾数据分布下的优势。

Method: 通过消融实验分析transformer组件，从关联记忆角度解释Muon的优势，并在理论分析中使用单层关联记忆模型验证发现。

Result: Muon的更新规则产生更各向同性的奇异谱，在重尾数据上能更有效地优化尾部类别，而Adam可能因嵌入特性导致学习误差差异。

Conclusion: Muon的核心优势在于其更新规则与线性关联记忆的外积结构一致，能够在重尾分布下实现比Adam更平衡和有效的尾部类别学习。

Abstract: The Muon optimizer is consistently faster than Adam in training Large
Language Models (LLMs), yet the mechanism underlying its success remains
unclear. This paper demystifies this mechanism through the lens of associative
memory. By ablating the transformer components optimized by Muon, we reveal
that the associative memory parameters of LLMs, namely the Value and Output
(VO) attention weights and Feed-Forward Networks (FFNs), are the primary
contributors to Muon's superiority. Motivated by this associative memory view,
we then explain Muon's superiority on real-world corpora, which are
intrinsically heavy-tailed: a few classes (tail classes) appear far less
frequently than others. The superiority is explained through two key
properties: (i) its update rule consistently yields a more isotropic singular
spectrum than Adam; and as a result, (ii) on heavy-tailed data, it optimizes
tail classes more effectively than Adam. Beyond empirical evidence, we
theoretically confirm these findings by analyzing a one-layer associative
memory model under class-imbalanced data. We prove that Muon consistently
achieves balanced learning across classes regardless of feature embeddings,
whereas Adam can induce large disparities in learning errors depending on
embedding properties. In summary, our empirical observations and theoretical
analyses reveal Muon's core advantage: its update rule aligns with the
outer-product structure of linear associative memories, enabling more balanced
and effective learning of tail classes in heavy-tailed distributions than Adam.

TL;DR: DPSBA是一个针对图神经网络分类任务的清洁标签后门攻击框架，通过学习分布内触发器来避免异常检测，在保持高攻击成功率的同时显著提升隐蔽性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图分类后门攻击方法存在结构异常（罕见子图触发器）和语义异常（标签翻转）问题，导致中毒图容易被异常检测模型发现，需要开发更隐蔽的攻击方法。

Method: 提出DPSBA框架，通过异常感知判别器指导的对抗训练学习分布内触发器，有效抑制结构和语义异常，实现清洁标签后门攻击。

Result: 在真实世界数据集上的广泛实验表明，DPSBA相比现有最优基线方法，在攻击效果和可检测性之间达到了更好的平衡。

Conclusion: DPSBA通过解决现有方法的结构和语义异常问题，实现了更隐蔽有效的图分类后门攻击，为图神经网络安全性研究提供了新思路。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated strong performance across
tasks such as node classification, link prediction, and graph classification,
but remain vulnerable to backdoor attacks that implant imperceptible triggers
during training to control predictions. While node-level attacks exploit local
message passing, graph-level attacks face the harder challenge of manipulating
global representations while maintaining stealth. We identify two main sources
of anomaly in existing graph classification backdoor methods: structural
deviation from rare subgraph triggers and semantic deviation caused by label
flipping, both of which make poisoned graphs easily detectable by anomaly
detection models. To address this, we propose DPSBA, a clean-label backdoor
framework that learns in-distribution triggers via adversarial training guided
by anomaly-aware discriminators. DPSBA effectively suppresses both structural
and semantic anomalies, achieving high attack success while significantly
improving stealth. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets validate that
DPSBA achieves a superior balance between effectiveness and detectability
compared to state-of-the-art baselines.

TL;DR: 提出了Temporal Experts Averaging (TEA)框架，通过权重平均更新整个模型来解决时序领域泛化问题，在保持计算效率的同时最大化泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常只预测分类器层权重，限制了泛化能力，而全模型预测计算成本过高。

Method: 通过约束权重变化在单个时序领域微调基础模型创建专家模型，然后在主成分子空间中建模时序权重轨迹，自适应地平均专家模型权重。

Result: 在7个TDG基准测试、5个模型和2种TDG设置中，TEA比现有方法性能提升高达69%，效率提升高达60倍。

Conclusion: TEA框架在时序领域泛化问题上实现了更好的性能与效率平衡。

Abstract: Temporal Domain Generalization (TDG) aims to generalize across temporal
distribution shifts, e.g., lexical change over time. Prior work often addresses
this by predicting future model weights. However, full model prediction is
prohibitively expensive for even reasonably sized models. Thus, recent methods
only predict the classifier layer, limiting generalization by failing to adjust
other model components. To address this, we propose Temporal Experts Averaging
(TEA), a novel and scalable TDG framework that updates the entire model using
weight averaging to maximize generalization potential while minimizing
computational costs. Our theoretical analysis guides us to two steps that
enhance generalization to future domains. First, we create expert models with
functional diversity yet parameter similarity by fine-tuning a domain-agnostic
base model on individual temporal domains while constraining weight changes.
Second, we optimize the bias-variance tradeoff through adaptive averaging
coefficients derived from modeling temporal weight trajectories in a principal
component subspace. Expert's contributions are based on their projected
proximity to future domains. Extensive experiments across 7 TDG benchmarks, 5
models, and 2 TDG settings shows TEA outperforms prior TDG methods by up to 69%
while being up to 60x more efficient.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种混合频谱-时间框架，用于单通道EEG中眼动、肌肉和噪声伪迹的实时检测与分类，通过特征工程使轻量级MLP在噪声环境下超越复杂深度学习模型。


<details>

Motivation: 解决真实场景中EEG伪迹检测面临的挑战：多通道方法计算效率低、对同时噪声鲁棒性差、深度学习模型在准确性和复杂性之间存在权衡。

Result: 在低信噪比（SNR -7 dB）下达到99%准确率，中等噪声（SNR 4 dB）下>90%准确率；对同时多源污染（眼动+肌肉+白噪声）保持96%分类准确率；训练时间仅30秒，比CNN快97%。

Conclusion: 该框架在临床适用性和计算效率之间架起桥梁，挑战了EEG伪迹检测中对模型深度的普遍依赖，证明领域知识引导的特征融合在噪声场景中优于复杂架构。

Abstract: Electroencephalogram (EEG) artifact detection in real-world settings faces
significant challenges such as computational inefficiency in multi-channel
methods, poor robustness to simultaneous noise, and trade-offs between accuracy
and complexity in deep learning models. We propose a hybrid spectral-temporal
framework for real-time detection and classification of ocular (EOG), muscular
(EMG), and white noise artifacts in single-channel EEG. This method, in
contrast to other approaches, combines time-domain low-pass filtering
(targeting low-frequency EOG) and frequency-domain power spectral density (PSD)
analysis (capturing broad-spectrum EMG), followed by PCA-optimized feature
fusion to minimize redundancy while preserving discriminative information. This
feature engineering strategy allows a lightweight multi-layer perceptron (MLP)
architecture to outperform advanced CNNs and RNNs by achieving 99% accuracy at
low SNRs (SNR -7) dB and >90% accuracy in moderate noise (SNR 4 dB).
Additionally, this framework addresses the unexplored problem of simultaneous
multi-source contamination(EMG+EOG+white noise), where it maintains 96%
classification accuracy despite overlapping artifacts. With 30-second training
times (97% faster than CNNs) and robust performance across SNR levels, this
framework bridges the gap between clinical applicability and computational
efficiency, which enables real-time use in wearable brain-computer interfaces.
This work also challenges the ubiquitous dependence on model depth for EEG
artifact detection by demonstrating that domain-informed feature fusion
surpasses complex architecture in noisy scenarios.

TL;DR: PPO和GRPO中的裁剪机制会导致熵偏差：clip-low增加熵，clip-high减少熵。在标准参数下，clip-high主导作用导致整体熵减少，即使使用随机奖励也会发生。通过调整clip-low可以控制熵，防止RLVR训练中的熵崩溃。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RLVR方法在增强大语言模型推理能力方面表现突出，但容易发生熵崩溃，导致模型快速收敛到近确定性形式，阻碍探索和长期RL训练的进展。

Method: 通过理论和实证分析，研究了PPO和GRPO中裁剪机制对熵的影响，揭示了clip-low和clip-high的不同作用。

Result: 发现clip-low增加熵，clip-high减少熵，标准参数下clip-high主导导致整体熵减少。调整clip-low可以增加熵并促进探索。

Conclusion: 裁剪机制是RLVR中被忽视的混杂因素，可以有意用于控制熵，防止熵崩溃，促进RL训练中的探索。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has recently emerged as
the leading approach for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language
models (LLMs). However, RLVR is prone to entropy collapse, where the LLM
quickly converges to a near-deterministic form, hindering exploration and
progress during prolonged RL training. In this work, we reveal that the
clipping mechanism in PPO and GRPO induces biases on entropy. Through
theoretical and empirical analyses, we show that clip-low increases entropy,
while clip-high decreases it. Further, under standard clipping parameters, the
effect of clip-high dominates, resulting in an overall entropy reduction even
when purely random rewards are provided to the RL algorithm. Our findings
highlight an overlooked confounding factor in RLVR: independent of the reward
signal, the clipping mechanism influences entropy, which in turn affects the
reasoning behavior. Furthermore, our analysis demonstrates that clipping can be
deliberately used to control entropy. Specifically, with a more aggressive
clip-low value, one can increase entropy, promote exploration, and ultimately
prevent entropy collapse in RLVR training.

Motivation: 现有的宏基因组分箱方法依赖确定性表示（如k-mer谱或大语言模型嵌入），无法有效处理由物种间DNA共享和高度相似片段表示所固有的不确定性。

Method: 提出概率嵌入方法，将每个DNA片段表示为潜在空间中的概率分布，引入数据自适应度量来扩展可行潜在空间，实现更灵活的分箱/聚类分离。

Result: 在真实宏基因组数据集上的实验表明，该方法在分箱任务上优于确定性k-mer和基于LLM的嵌入方法，为大规模宏基因组分析提供了可扩展的轻量级解决方案。

Conclusion: 概率嵌入框架能够自然建模序列级不确定性，提供嵌入可区分性的理论保证，在宏基因组分箱任务中表现出显著改进。

Abstract: Metagenomic binning aims to cluster DNA fragments from mixed microbial
samples into their respective genomes, a critical step for downstream analyses
of microbial communities. Existing methods rely on deterministic
representations, such as k-mer profiles or embeddings from large language
models, which fail to capture the uncertainty inherent in DNA sequences arising
from inter-species DNA sharing and from fragments with highly similar
representations. We present the first probabilistic embedding approach,
UncertainGen, for metagenomic binning, representing each DNA fragment as a
probability distribution in latent space. Our approach naturally models
sequence-level uncertainty, and we provide theoretical guarantees on embedding
distinguishability. This probabilistic embedding framework expands the feasible
latent space by introducing a data-adaptive metric, which in turn enables more
flexible separation of bins/clusters. Experiments on real metagenomic datasets
demonstrate the improvements over deterministic k-mer and LLM-based embeddings
for the binning task by offering a scalable and lightweight solution for
large-scale metagenomic analysis.

Motivation: 智能制造需要满足严格延迟和能耗预算的设备端智能。超维计算(HDC)通过将数据编码为高维超向量并使用简单操作计算，提供了轻量级替代方案。但先前研究假设HDC超参数与性能的定性关系在不同应用中稳定，这一假设需要验证。

Conclusion: 领域感知的HDC编码是必要的，调优后的HDC为受限硬件上的实时工业AI提供了实用、可扩展的路径。未来工作将实现自适应编码器和超参数选择，扩展到更多制造模式验证，并在低功耗加速器上验证。

Abstract: Smart manufacturing requires on-device intelligence that meets strict latency
and energy budgets. HyperDimensional Computing (HDC) offers a lightweight
alternative by encoding data as high-dimensional hypervectors and computing
with simple operations. Prior studies often assume that the qualitative
relation between HDC hyperparameters and performance is stable across
applications. Our analysis of two representative tasks, signal-based quality
monitoring in Computer Numerical Control (CNC) machining and image-based defect
detection in Laser Powder Bed Fusion (LPBF), shows that this assumption does
not hold. We map how encoder type, projection variance, hypervector
dimensionality, and data regime shape accuracy, inference latency, training
time, and training energy. A formal complexity model explains predictable
trends in encoding and similarity computation and reveals nonmonotonic
interactions with retraining that preclude a closed-form optimum. Empirically,
signals favor nonlinear Random Fourier Features with more exclusive encodings
and saturate in accuracy beyond moderate dimensionality. Images favor linear
Random Projection, achieve high accuracy with small dimensionality, and depend
more on sample count than on dimensionality. Guided by these insights, we tune
HDC under multiobjective constraints that reflect edge deployment and obtain
models that match or exceed the accuracy of state-of-the-art deep learning and
Transformer models while delivering at least 6x faster inference and more than
40x lower training energy. These results demonstrate that domain-aware HDC
encoding is necessary and that tuned HDC offers a practical, scalable path to
real-time industrial AI on constrained hardware. Future work will enable
adaptive encoder and hyperparameter selection, expand evaluation to additional
manufacturing modalities, and validate on low-power accelerators.

Abstract: The appearance of transformer-based models in Reinforcement Learning (RL) has
expanded the horizons of possibilities in robotics tasks, but it has
simultaneously brought a wide range of challenges during its implementation,
especially in model-free online RL. Some of the existing learning algorithms
cannot be easily implemented with transformer-based models due to the
instability of the latter. In this paper, we propose a method that uses the
Accelerator policy as a transformer's trainer. The Accelerator, a simpler and
more stable model, interacts with the environment independently while
simultaneously training the transformer through behavior cloning during the
first stage of the proposed algorithm. In the second stage, the pretrained
transformer starts to interact with the environment in a fully online setting.
As a result, this model-free algorithm accelerates the transformer in terms of
its performance and helps it to train online in a more stable and faster way.
By conducting experiments on both state-based and image-based ManiSkill
environments, as well as on MuJoCo tasks in MDP and POMDP settings, we show
that applying our algorithm not only enables stable training of transformers
but also reduces training time on image-based environments by up to a factor of
two. Moreover, it decreases the required replay buffer size in off-policy
methods to 10-20 thousand, which significantly lowers the overall computational
demands.

Abstract: There is high demand on fire simulations, in both scale and quantity. We
present a multi-pronged approach to improving the time and energy required to
meet these demands. We show the ability of a custom machine learning surrogate
model to predict the dynamics of heat propagation orders of magnitude faster
than state-of-the-art CFD software for this application. We also demonstrate
how a guided optimisation procedure can decrease the number of simulations
required to meet an objective; using lightweight models to decide which
simulations to run, we see a tenfold reduction when locating the most dangerous
location for a fire to occur within a building based on the impact of smoke on
visibility. Finally we present a framework and product, Simvue, through which
we access these tools along with a host of automatic organisational and
tracking features which enables future reuse of data and more savings through
better management of simulations and combating redundancy.

Abstract: Alignment of large language models remains a central challenge in natural
language processing. Preference optimization has emerged as a popular and
effective method for improving alignment, typically through training-time or
prompt-based interventions. In this paper, we introduce alignment-aware
decoding (AAD), a method to enhance model alignment directly at inference.
Theoretically, AAD can be interpreted as implicit reward optimization, yet it
requires no specialized training beyond the standard DPO setup. Empirically,
AAD consistently outperforms strong baselines across diverse alignment
benchmarks and model scales. Moreover, in data-constrained settings, AAD can
produce high-quality synthetic data to improve alignment under standard
decoding, providing a practical solution when labeled data is limited.

Abstract: Mapping informal settlements is crucial for addressing challenges related to
urban planning, public health, and infrastructure in rapidly growing cities.
Geospatial machine learning has emerged as a key tool for detecting and mapping
these areas from remote sensing data. However, existing approaches often treat
spatial units independently, neglecting the relational structure of the urban
fabric. We propose a graph-based framework that explicitly incorporates local
geographical context into the classification process. Each spatial unit (cell)
is embedded in a graph structure along with its adjacent neighbors, and a
lightweight Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) is trained to classify whether
the central cell belongs to an informal settlement. Experiments are conducted
on a case study in Rio de Janeiro using spatial cross-validation across five
distinct zones, ensuring robustness and generalizability across heterogeneous
urban landscapes. Our method outperforms standard baselines, improving Kappa
coefficient by 17 points over individual cell classification. We also show that
graph-based modeling surpasses simple feature concatenation of neighboring
cells, demonstrating the benefit of encoding spatial structure for urban scene
understanding.

Abstract: Neural operator models for solving partial differential equations (PDEs)
often rely on global mixing mechanisms-such as spectral convolutions or
attention-which tend to oversmooth sharp local dynamics and introduce high
computational cost. We present FINO, a finite-difference-inspired neural
architecture that enforces strict locality while retaining multiscale
representational power. FINO replaces fixed finite-difference stencil
coefficients with learnable convolutional kernels and evolves states via an
explicit, learnable time-stepping scheme. A central Local Operator Block
leverage a differential stencil layer, a gating mask, and a linear fuse step to
construct adaptive derivative-like local features that propagate forward in
time. Embedded in an encoder-decoder with a bottleneck, FINO captures
fine-grained local structures while preserving interpretability. We establish
(i) a composition error bound linking one-step approximation error to stable
long-horizon rollouts under a Lipschitz condition, and (ii) a universal
approximation theorem for discrete time-stepped PDE dynamics. (iii) Across six
benchmarks and a climate modelling task, FINO achieves up to 44\% lower error
and up to around 2\times speedups over state-of-the-art operator-learning
baselines, demonstrating that strict locality with learnable time-stepping
yields an accurate and scalable foundation for neural PDE solvers.

Abstract: Ensuring optimal Indoor Environmental Quality (IEQ) is vital for occupant
health and productivity, yet it often comes at a high energy cost in
conventional Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC) systems. This
paper proposes a deep learning driven approach to proactively manage IEQ
parameters specifically CO2 concentration, temperature, and humidity while
balancing building energy efficiency. Leveraging the ROBOD dataset collected
from a net-zero energy academic building, we benchmark three
architectures--Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Gated Recurrent Units (GRU), and
a hybrid Convolutional Neural Network LSTM (CNN-LSTM)--to forecast IEQ
variables across various time horizons. Our results show that GRU achieves the
best short-term prediction accuracy with lower computational overhead, whereas
CNN-LSTM excels in extracting dominant features for extended forecasting
windows. Meanwhile, LSTM offers robust long-range temporal modeling. The
comparative analysis highlights that prediction reliability depends on data
resolution, sensor placement, and fluctuating occupancy conditions. These
findings provide actionable insights for intelligent Building Management
Systems (BMS) to implement predictive HVAC control, thereby reducing energy
consumption and enhancing occupant comfort in real-world building operations.

### [140] [Marginal Flow: a flexible and efficient framework for density estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26221)
*Marcello Massimo Negri,Jonathan Aellen,Manuel Jahn,AmirEhsan Khorashadizadeh,Volker Roth*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Marginal Flow的密度建模框架，通过参数化分布和潜在参数采样，克服了现有方法在训练成本、推理速度、似然近似、模式崩溃等方面的限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决当前密度建模方法存在的训练成本高、推理速度慢、近似似然、模式崩溃或架构约束等问题。

Method: 定义参数化分布q(x|w)和潜在参数w，通过从可学习分布q_θ(w)中采样w来边缘化潜在变量，实现高效密度评估和采样。

Result: 模型支持精确密度评估，在训练和推理速度上比竞争模型快数个数量级，能够处理低维流形分布、多模态目标，并可用任何目标函数高效训练。

Conclusion: Marginal Flow是一个简单而强大的框架，在合成数据集、基于模拟的推理、正定矩阵分布和图像潜在空间流形学习等任务中表现优异。

Abstract: Current density modeling approaches suffer from at least one of the following
shortcomings: expensive training, slow inference, approximate likelihood, mode
collapse or architectural constraints like bijective mappings. We propose a
simple yet powerful framework that overcomes these limitations altogether. We
define our model $q_\theta(x)$ through a parametric distribution $q(x|w)$ with
latent parameters $w$. Instead of directly optimizing the latent variables $w$,
our idea is to marginalize them out by sampling $w$ from a learnable
distribution $q_\theta(w)$, hence the name Marginal Flow. In order to evaluate
the learned density $q_\theta(x)$ or to sample from it, we only need to draw
samples from $q_\theta(w)$, which makes both operations efficient. The proposed
model allows for exact density evaluation and is orders of magnitude faster
than competing models both at training and inference. Furthermore, Marginal
Flow is a flexible framework: it does not impose any restrictions on the neural
network architecture, it enables learning distributions on lower-dimensional
manifolds (either known or to be learned), it can be trained efficiently with
any objective (e.g. forward and reverse KL divergence), and it easily handles
multi-modal targets. We evaluate Marginal Flow extensively on various tasks
including synthetic datasets, simulation-based inference, distributions on
positive definite matrices and manifold learning in latent spaces of images.

*Xin Xu,Cliveb AI,Kai Yang,Tianhao Chen,Yang Wang,Saiyong Yang,Can Yang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出TFPI方法，通过简单的ThinkFree操作（直接添加</think>标签丢弃思考内容）来减少推理时的token使用，从而加速RLVR训练收敛、提高性能上限并生成更token高效的语言模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RLVR方法虽然能有效解决复杂任务，但训练时需要极长的上下文长度，导致巨大的计算成本。多阶段训练方法虽然能部分缓解，但初始上下文过短会导致不可逆的性能下降，无法显著减少整体训练计算量。

Method: TFPI方法在RLVR基础上引入ThinkFree操作，通过显式丢弃思考内容（直接添加</think>标签）来减少推理时的token使用。使用ThinkFree适配的输入进行训练，即使在原始慢思考模式下也能提高性能并降低token消耗。

Result: 在多个基准测试上的实验表明，TFPI能加速RL收敛，达到更高的性能上限，并产生更token高效的推理模型。仅使用TFPI，4B模型在AIME24上达到89.0%准确率，在LiveCodeBench上达到65.5%，使用不到4K H20小时。

Conclusion: TFPI是一种简单有效的RLVR适配方法，不需要专门的奖励或复杂的训练设计，就能显著提高训练效率和模型性能。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Reward (RLVR) effectively solves
complex tasks but demands extremely long context lengths during training,
leading to substantial computational costs. While multi-stage training can
partially mitigate this, starting with overly short contexts often causes
irreversible performance degradation, ultimately failing to reduce overall
training compute significantly. In this paper, we introduce
**T**hinking-**F**ree **P**olicy **I**nitialization (**TFPI**), a simple yet
effective adaptation to RLVR that bridges long Chain-of-Thought (CoT)
distillation and standard RLVR. TFPI employs a simple *ThinkFree* operation,
explicitly discarding the thinking content via a direct *</think>* append, to
reduce token usage during inference. Training with *ThinkFree*-adapted inputs
improves performance and lowers token consumption, even in the original
slow-thinking mode. Extensive experiments across various benchmarks have shown
that TFPI accelerates RL convergence, achieves a higher performance ceiling,
and yields more token-efficient reasoning models without specialized rewards or
complex training designs. With TFPI only, we train a 4B model to reach 89.0%
accuracy on AIME24 and 65.5% on LiveCodeBench using less than 4K H20 hours.

*Ayush Patnaik,Adam B Zufall,Stephen K Robinson,Xinfan Lin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出一种基于高斯过程的锂沉积检测方法，通过直接建模电荷-电压关系来概率性地推断dQ/dV，实现鲁棒的锂沉积检测而无需特殊平滑处理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 锂沉积是快充过程中的关键退化机制，会加速容量衰减并引发安全隐患。传统dQ/dV计算方法依赖有限差分和滤波，会放大传感器噪声并引入峰值位置偏差。

Method: 使用高斯过程框架直接建模电荷-电压关系Q(V)作为随机过程，利用GP导数仍是GP的特性，从后验分布中分析性和概率性地推断dQ/dV。

Result: 在锂离子纽扣电池上验证，该方法在低温高倍率充电条件下可靠检测到沉积峰，在基线情况下正确报告无峰，且与参考性能测试测量的容量衰减一致。

Conclusion: 该方法为实时锂沉积检测提供了实用途径，具有噪声感知推断、闭式导数不确定性量化和在线扩展性三大优势。

Abstract: Lithium plating during fast charging is a critical degradation mechanism that
accelerates capacity fade and can trigger catastrophic safety failures. Recent
work has identified a distinctive dQ/dV peak above 4.0 V as a reliable
signature of plating onset; however, conventional methods for computing dQ/dV
rely on finite differencing with filtering, which amplifies sensor noise and
introduces bias in peak location. In this paper, we propose a Gaussian Process
(GP) framework for lithium plating detection by directly modeling the
charge-voltage relationship Q(V) as a stochastic process with calibrated
uncertainty. Leveraging the property that derivatives of GPs remain GPs, we
infer dQ/dV analytically and probabilistically from the posterior, enabling
robust detection without ad hoc smoothing. The framework provides three key
benefits: (i) noise-aware inference with hyperparameters learned from data,
(ii) closed-form derivatives with credible intervals for uncertainty
quantification, and (iii) scalability to online variants suitable for embedded
BMS. Experimental validation on Li-ion coin cells across a range of C-rates
(0.2C-1C) and temperatures (0-40\deg C) demonstrates that the GP-based method
reliably detects plating peaks under low-temperature, high-rate charging, while
correctly reporting no peaks in baseline cases. The concurrence of
GP-identified differential peaks, reduced charge throughput, and capacity fade
measured via reference performance tests confirms the method's accuracy and
robustness, establishing a practical pathway for real-time lithium plating
detection.

*James Oldfield,Philip Torr,Ioannis Patras,Adel Bibi,Fazl Barez*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出截断多项式分类器(TPCs)，用于动态监控大语言模型的激活状态，实现计算资源的灵活分配：简单输入快速退出，复杂输入使用更多计算资源进行更严格的安全检测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统安全监控器对所有查询使用相同计算量，造成资源浪费或检测不足。需要一种灵活的安全监控方法，计算成本仅在输入难以评估或计算资源充足时增加。

Method: 开发截断多项式分类器(TPCs)，作为线性探针的自然扩展，支持逐项训练和评估多项式。测试时可提前停止进行轻量监控，或使用更多项获得更强防护。

Result: 在两个大规模安全数据集(WildGuardMix和BeaverTails)上，对4个参数高达300亿的模型进行测试，TPCs在相同规模下与MLP探针基线竞争或表现更优，同时比黑盒方法更具可解释性。

Conclusion: TPCs提供两种使用模式：安全调节器模式允许通过评估更多项来获得更强防护；自适应级联模式让简单案例早期退出，仅对模糊输入评估高阶防护，降低监控总成本。

Abstract: Monitoring large language models' (LLMs) activations is an effective way to
detect harmful requests before they lead to unsafe outputs. However,
traditional safety monitors often require the same amount of compute for every
query. This creates a trade-off: expensive monitors waste resources on easy
inputs, while cheap ones risk missing subtle cases. We argue that safety
monitors should be flexible--costs should rise only when inputs are difficult
to assess, or when more compute is available. To achieve this, we introduce
Truncated Polynomial Classifiers (TPCs), a natural extension of linear probes
for dynamic activation monitoring. Our key insight is that polynomials can be
trained and evaluated progressively, term-by-term. At test-time, one can
early-stop for lightweight monitoring, or use more terms for stronger
guardrails when needed. TPCs provide two modes of use. First, as a safety dial:
by evaluating more terms, developers and regulators can "buy" stronger
guardrails from the same model. Second, as an adaptive cascade: clear cases
exit early after low-order checks, and higher-order guardrails are evaluated
only for ambiguous inputs, reducing overall monitoring costs. On two
large-scale safety datasets (WildGuardMix and BeaverTails), for 4 models with
up to 30B parameters, we show that TPCs compete with or outperform MLP-based
probe baselines of the same size, all the while being more interpretable than
their black-box counterparts. Our code is available at

TL;DR: 本文开发了一个战略欺骗模型来检测AI系统在安全评估中的"装傻"行为，构建了统计测试来区分真实能力不足和故意表现不佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 前沿AI系统在安全评估中可能故意隐藏危险能力或表现不佳来避免被停用或重新训练，这种"装傻"行为会破坏安全评估的完整性。

Method: 基于生存多臂老虎机框架开发了战略欺骗的序列决策模型，构建了统计测试来从测试分数序列中区分装傻和无能。

Result: 理论证明该问题会诱导最优理性代理产生装傻行为，仿真实验验证了统计测试在区分这两种行为方面的可靠性。

Conclusion: 这项工作为前沿模型评估科学开发稳健统计程序提供了潜在途径，有助于提高AI安全评估的可靠性。

Abstract: Evaluating the safety of frontier AI systems is an increasingly important
concern, helping to measure the capabilities of such models and identify risks
before deployment. However, it has been recognised that if AI agents are aware
that they are being evaluated, such agents may deliberately hide dangerous
capabilities or intentionally demonstrate suboptimal performance in
safety-related tasks in order to be released and to avoid being deactivated or
retrained. Such strategic deception - often known as "sandbagging" - threatens
to undermine the integrity of safety evaluations. For this reason, it is of
value to identify methods that enable us to distinguish behavioural patterns
that demonstrate a true lack of capability from behavioural patterns that are
consistent with sandbagging. In this paper, we develop a simple model of
strategic deception in sequential decision-making tasks, inspired by the
recently developed survival bandit framework. We demonstrate theoretically that
this problem induces sandbagging behaviour in optimal rational agents, and
construct a statistical test to distinguish between sandbagging and
incompetence from sequences of test scores. In simulation experiments, we
investigate the reliability of this test in allowing us to distinguish between
such behaviours in bandit models. This work aims to establish a potential
avenue for developing robust statistical procedures for use in the science of
frontier model evaluations.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于Wasserstein分布鲁棒性的框架，用于在最坏情况下的测试分布上认证群体公平性，确保在分布偏移下的稳定公平性评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 群体公平性指标在重采样和分布偏移下变化剧烈且脆弱，影响审计的可靠性，需要一种能够在分布偏移下稳定评估公平性的方法。

Method: 使用Wasserstein分布鲁棒框架，通过强对偶性推导可处理的重新表述，并开发了高效的DRUNE估计器来评估ε-WDF。

Result: 在标准基准测试和分类器上，ε-WDF在分布偏移下提供了稳定的公平性评估，具有可行性、一致性和有限样本认证保证。

Conclusion: ε-WDF为超越观测数据的群体公平性审计和认证提供了原则性基础，确保在分布偏移下的可靠公平性评估。

Abstract: Group-fairness metrics (e.g., equalized odds) can vary sharply across
resamples and are especially brittle under distribution shift, undermining
reliable audits. We propose a Wasserstein distributionally robust framework
that certifies worst-case group fairness over a ball of plausible test
distributions centered at the empirical law. Our formulation unifies common
group fairness notions via a generic conditional-probability functional and
defines $\varepsilon$-Wasserstein Distributional Fairness ($\varepsilon$-WDF)
as the audit target. Leveraging strong duality, we derive tractable
reformulations and an efficient estimator (DRUNE) for $\varepsilon$-WDF. We
prove feasibility and consistency and establish finite-sample certification
guarantees for auditing fairness, along with quantitative bounds under
smoothness and margin conditions. Across standard benchmarks and classifiers,
$\varepsilon$-WDF delivers stable fairness assessments under distribution
shift, providing a principled basis for auditing and certifying group fairness
beyond observational data.

Motivation: 现有研究很少将分布鲁棒优化应用于个体公平性，特别是在考虑因果结构和敏感属性的学习问题中，该研究旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 从因果和个体公平角度构建DRO问题，提出双重公式化方法，推导近似最坏情况损失的闭式正则化器，并在未知因果结构情况下使用经验分布进行估计。

Result: 成功将DRO问题转化为更易计算的形式，消除了min-max问题中的max步骤，并提供了使用经验分布时的有限样本误差界。

Conclusion: 该研究为在因果框架下应用分布鲁棒优化解决个体公平性问题提供了有效方法，确保了学习过程的效率和鲁棒性。

Abstract: In recent years, Wasserstein Distributionally Robust Optimization (DRO) has
garnered substantial interest for its efficacy in data-driven decision-making
under distributional uncertainty. However, limited research has explored the
application of DRO to address individual fairness concerns, particularly when
considering causal structures and sensitive attributes in learning problems. To
address this gap, we first formulate the DRO problem from causality and
individual fairness perspectives. We then present the DRO dual formulation as
an efficient tool to convert the DRO problem into a more tractable and
computationally efficient form. Next, we characterize the closed form of the
approximate worst-case loss quantity as a regularizer, eliminating the max-step
in the min-max DRO problem. We further estimate the regularizer in more general
cases and explore the relationship between DRO and classical robust
optimization. Finally, by removing the assumption of a known structural causal
model, we provide finite sample error bounds when designing DRO with empirical
distributions and estimated causal structures to ensure efficiency and robust
learning.

TL;DR: 本文比较了不同生成模型在物理系统模拟中的表现，重点评估了随机插值方法相比传统基于高斯去噪的方法在自回归预测任务中的优势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统生成模型主要依赖迭代去噪高斯噪声，但在PDE和动力系统（如气候）的自回归预测任务中可能不是最有效的选择。需要探索更适合物理系统模拟的生成建模方法。

Method: 使用随机插值方法，直接学习当前状态和未来状态之间的随机过程，利用连续物理分布之间的邻近性。这种方法可以使用更少的采样步骤生成更准确的预测。

Result: 实验表明随机插值方法比基于传输高斯噪声的模型产生更准确的预测，且需要更少的采样步骤。生成模型需要在确定性精度、频谱一致性和概率校准之间取得平衡。

Conclusion: 随机插值方法为物理仿真提供了有竞争力的基准，通过调整采样策略可以满足物理系统模拟的各项要求，为不同生成建模框架的能力提供了深入见解。

Abstract: Generative models have recently emerged as powerful surrogates for physical
systems, demonstrating increased accuracy, stability, and/or statistical
fidelity. Most approaches rely on iteratively denoising a Gaussian, a choice
that may not be the most effective for autoregressive prediction tasks in PDEs
and dynamical systems such as climate. In this work, we benchmark generative
models across diverse physical domains and tasks, and highlight the role of
stochastic interpolants. By directly learning a stochastic process between
current and future states, stochastic interpolants can leverage the proximity
of successive physical distributions. This allows for generative models that
can use fewer sampling steps and produce more accurate predictions than models
relying on transporting Gaussian noise. Our experiments suggest that generative
models need to balance deterministic accuracy, spectral consistency, and
probabilistic calibration, and that stochastic interpolants can potentially
fulfill these requirements by adjusting their sampling. This study establishes
stochastic interpolants as a competitive baseline for physical emulation and
gives insight into the abilities of different generative modeling frameworks.

Motivation: 在低数据量模仿学习场景中，传统依赖大规模预训练或高容量架构的方法难以应用，需要开发对演示数据高效利用的方法。

Method: 将模仿学习建模为最优传输问题，通过对抗训练求解，无需预训练或特殊架构，内置不确定性估计。

Abstract: Large-scale foundation models for EEG signals offer a promising path to
generalizable brain-computer interface (BCI) applications, but they often
suffer from misalignment between pretraining objectives and downstream tasks,
as well as significant cross-subject distribution shifts. This paper addresses
these challenges by introducing a two-stage alignment strategy that bridges the
gap between generic pretraining and specific EEG decoding tasks. First, we
propose NeuroTTT: a domain-specific self-supervised fine-tuning paradigm that
augments the foundation model with task-relevant self-supervised objectives,
aligning latent representations to important spectral, spatial, and temporal
EEG features without requiring additional labeled data. Second, we incorporate
test-time training (TTT) at inference, we perform (i) self-supervised test-time
training on individual unlabeled test samples and (ii) prediction entropy
minimization (Tent), which updates only normalization statistics to continually
calibrate the model to each new input on the fly. Our approach, which, to our
knowledge, is the first to unify domain-tuned self-supervision with test-time
training in large-scale EEG foundation models, yields substantially improved
robustness and accuracy across diverse BCI tasks (imagined speech, stress
detection, motor imagery). Using CBraMod and LaBraM as backbones, our method
pushes their performance to a markedly higher level. Results on three diverse
tasks demonstrate that the proposed alignment strategy achieves
state-of-the-art performance, outperforming conventional fine-tuning and
adaptation methods. Our code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准解码方法在满足复杂指令遵循和事实准确性方面存在不足，而现有控制技术往往会降低输出质量。需要一种既能保持输出质量又能增强可靠性的方法。

Method: AGD考虑一组高概率输出token候选，选择对用户定义ROI具有最高归因的token。ROI可以灵活定义在模型输入或内部组件的不同部分，支持自适应熵基变体以减少计算开销。

Result: 在指令遵循方面显著提升成功率(Llama 3.1从66.0%提升至79.1%)；在知识密集型任务中减少幻觉并提高事实准确性；自适应变体能缓解质量下降。

Conclusion: AGD是一种多功能、更可解释且有效的方法，能够增强现代LLMs的可靠性。

Abstract: The capacity of Large Language Models (LLMs) to follow complex instructions
and generate factually accurate text is critical for their real-world
application. However, standard decoding methods often fail to robustly satisfy
these requirements, while existing control techniques frequently degrade
general output quality. In this work, we introduce Attribution-Guided Decoding
(AGD), an interpretability-based decoding strategy. Instead of directly
manipulating model activations, AGD considers a set of high-probability output
token candidates and selects the one that exhibits the highest attribution to a
user-defined Region of Interest (ROI). This ROI can be flexibly defined over
different parts of the model's input or internal components, allowing AGD to
steer generation towards various desirable behaviors. We demonstrate AGD's
efficacy across three challenging domains. For instruction following, we show
that AGD significantly boosts adherence (e.g., improving the overall success
rate on Llama 3.1 from 66.0% to 79.1%). For knowledge-intensive tasks, we show
that guiding generation towards usage of internal knowledge components or
contextual sources can reduce hallucinations and improve factual accuracy in
both closed-book and open-book settings. Furthermore, we propose an adaptive,
entropy-based variant of AGD that mitigates quality degradation and reduces
computational overhead by applying guidance only when the model is uncertain.
Our work presents a versatile, more interpretable, and effective method for
enhancing the reliability of modern LLMs.

Conclusion: 这项工作填补了单问题多尝试启发式优化领域综述的空白，为实践者提供了系统化的策略选择和分类框架。

Abstract: In certain real-world optimization scenarios, practitioners are not
interested in solving multiple problems but rather in finding the best solution
to a single, specific problem. When the computational budget is large relative
to the cost of evaluating a candidate solution, multiple heuristic alternatives
can be tried to solve the same given problem, each possibly with a different
algorithm, parameter configuration, initialization, or stopping criterion. The
sequential selection of which alternative to try next is crucial for
efficiently identifying the one that provides the best possible solution across
multiple attempts. Despite the relevance of this problem in practice, it has
not yet been the exclusive focus of any existing review. Several sequential
alternative selection strategies have been proposed in different research
topics, but they have not been comprehensively and systematically unified under
a common perspective.
  This work presents a focused review of single-problem multi-attempt heuristic
optimization. It brings together suitable strategies to this problem that have
been studied separately through algorithm selection, parameter tuning,
multi-start and resource allocation. These strategies are explained using a
unified terminology within a common framework, which supports the development
of a taxonomy for systematically organizing and classifying them.

Motivation: 现有反事实解释方法需要大量模型评估，成本高且不实用，特别是在模型访问受限时

Method: ACE算法结合贝叶斯估计和随机优化，通过优先选择信息量大的点来近似决策边界

Result: 大量实验表明，ACE在评估效率上优于现有方法，同时能有效识别最小且可行的改变

Conclusion: ACE是一种样本高效的算法，能在保持解释准确性的同时显著减少模型查询次数

Abstract: Counterfactual Explanations (CFEs) interpret machine learning models by
identifying the smallest change to input features needed to change the model's
prediction to a desired output. For classification tasks, CFEs determine how
close a given sample is to the decision boundary of a trained classifier.
Existing methods are often sample-inefficient, requiring numerous evaluations
of a black-box model -- an approach that is both costly and impractical when
access to the model is limited. We propose Adaptive sampling for Counterfactual
Explanations (ACE), a sample-efficient algorithm combining Bayesian estimation
and stochastic optimization to approximate the decision boundary with fewer
queries. By prioritizing informative points, ACE minimizes evaluations while
generating accurate and feasible CFEs. Extensive empirical results show that
ACE achieves superior evaluation efficiency compared to state-of-the-art
methods, while maintaining effectiveness in identifying minimal and actionable

### [153] [A Generalized Information Bottleneck Theory of Deep Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26327)
*Charles Westphal,Stephen Hailes,Mirco Musolesi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出广义信息瓶颈(GIB)框架，通过协同信息视角重新表述原始IB原则，解决了IB理论中的模糊性和估计困难问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 原始信息瓶颈(IB)原则在理解神经网络学习方面具有理论价值，但存在理论模糊性和估计困难等实际应用限制。

Method: 基于协同信息（特征联合处理获得的信息）重新表述IB，使用平均交互信息(II)作为可计算的协同度量，构建GIB框架。

Result: GIB在各种架构中（包括ReLU激活网络）都表现出压缩阶段，在CNN和Transformer中产生可解释的动态，并与对抗鲁棒性理解更一致。

Conclusion: GIB框架在保持与现有IB理论兼容性的同时，解决了原始IB的局限性，提供了更实用的信息瓶颈分析方法。

Abstract: The Information Bottleneck (IB) principle offers a compelling theoretical
framework to understand how neural networks (NNs) learn. However, its practical
utility has been constrained by unresolved theoretical ambiguities and
significant challenges in accurate estimation. In this paper, we present a
\textit{Generalized Information Bottleneck (GIB)} framework that reformulates
the original IB principle through the lens of synergy, i.e., the information
obtainable only through joint processing of features. We provide theoretical
and empirical evidence demonstrating that synergistic functions achieve
superior generalization compared to their non-synergistic counterparts.
Building on these foundations we re-formulate the IB using a computable
definition of synergy based on the average interaction information (II) of each
feature with those remaining. We demonstrate that the original IB objective is
upper bounded by our GIB in the case of perfect estimation, ensuring
compatibility with existing IB theory while addressing its limitations. Our
experimental results demonstrate that GIB consistently exhibits compression
phases across a wide range of architectures (including those with \textit{ReLU}
activations where the standard IB fails), while yielding interpretable dynamics
in both CNNs and Transformers and aligning more closely with our understanding
of adversarial robustness.

### [154] [FedMuon: Federated Learning with Bias-corrected LMO-based Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26337)
*Yuki Takezawa,Anastasia Koloskova,Xiaowen Jiang,Sebastian U. Stich*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了FedMuon方法，将Muon优化器应用于联邦学习，解决了直接使用Muon作为本地优化器不收敛的问题，并通过实验证明其性能优于现有联邦学习方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Muon优化器在神经网络训练中比Adam等自适应方法更快，但直接应用于联邦学习时由于线性最小化算子(LMO)的偏差性导致不收敛，需要解决这一问题。

Method: 提出FedMuon方法，通过缓解LMO偏差问题，并分析近似求解LMO对收敛速度的影响，支持任意次数的Newton-Schulz迭代。

Result: FedMuon能够收敛，且LMO求解越准确收敛越快，实验表明其性能优于最先进的联邦学习方法。

Conclusion: FedMuon成功将Muon优化器应用于联邦学习，解决了收敛性问题，并在准确性和效率上表现出优势。

Abstract: Recently, a new optimization method based on the linear minimization oracle
(LMO), called Muon, has been attracting increasing attention since it can train
neural networks faster than existing adaptive optimization methods, such as
Adam. In this paper, we study how Muon can be utilized in federated learning.
We first show that straightforwardly using Muon as the local optimizer of
FedAvg does not converge to the stationary point since the LMO is a biased
operator. We then propose FedMuon which can mitigate this issue. We also
analyze how solving the LMO approximately affects the convergence rate and find
that, surprisingly, FedMuon can converge for any number of Newton-Schulz
iterations, while it can converge faster as we solve the LMO more accurately.
Through experiments, we demonstrated that FedMuon can outperform the
state-of-the-art federated learning methods.

### [155] [Memory-Driven Self-Improvement for Decision Making with Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26340)
*Xue Yan,Zijing Ou,Mengyue Yang,Yan Song,Haifeng Zhang,Yingzhen Li,Jun Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种记忆驱动的自我改进框架，将LLM的通用先验知识与特定领域的紧凑记忆相结合，通过记忆和LLM先验的相互增强来提升序列决策任务的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM在序列决策任务中具有广泛但通用的知识，对于特定任务数据有限的情况难以有效适应，需要结合领域特定经验来提升决策性能。

Method: 使用记忆存储过去交互和关联的Q值，捕获决策相关知识来促进准确的价值估计，并指导LLM先验的优化。优化后的LLM先验生成更高奖励的轨迹来丰富记忆，形成自我改进循环。

Result: 在ALFWorld实验中，该方法显著优于传统RL和基于LLM的基线方法，在分布内任务上性能提升超过40%，在未见任务上泛化性能提升超过75%。

Conclusion: 记忆驱动的自我改进框架通过结合LLM通用知识和领域特定经验，有效提升了序列决策任务的性能和泛化能力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have emerged as effective action policies for
sequential decision-making (SDM) tasks due to their extensive prior knowledge.
However, this broad yet general knowledge is often insufficient for specific
decision-making tasks with limited task-related data, making it challenging to
efficiently adapt LLMs to specific SDM tasks. To address this challenge, we
propose a memory-driven self-improvement framework that combines LLM general
prior knowledge with a compact memory of domain-specific experiences. Memory
retains past interactions and associated Q-values, thereby capturing
decision-relevant knowledge that facilitates accurate value estimation and
informs the LLM prior refinement. The refined LLM prior, in turn, generates
higher-reward trajectories that further enrich memory, forming a natural
self-improvement framework where memory and LLM prior mutually reinforce each
other. Experiments show that our memory-driven approach significantly
outperforms both traditional RL and LLM-based baselines, e.g., improving
performance by over 40\% on in-distribution tasks and over 75\% when
generalized to unseen tasks in ALFWorld.

### [156] [LLM-Assisted Emergency Triage Benchmark: Bridging Hospital-Rich and MCI-Like Field Simulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26351)
*Joshua Sebastian,Karma Tobden,KMA Solaiman*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文创建了一个开放、可复现的急诊分诊基准，用于预测患者恶化情况（ICU转移、院内死亡率），包含医院丰富环境和MCI模拟环境两种场景，并利用LLM辅助数据集构建。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决急诊和群体伤亡事件分诊研究中缺乏开放可用、可复现基准的问题，这些场景需要快速识别最需要帮助的患者，准确预测恶化情况可以指导及时干预。

Method: 引入LLM辅助的急诊分诊基准，定义两种场景：医院丰富环境（含生命体征、实验室数据、病历等）和MCI模拟环境（仅含生命体征、观察和病历）。利用LLM进行数据字段协调、特征优先级排序和模式对齐。

Result: 提供了基准模型和基于SHAP的可解释性分析，展示了不同场景间的预测差距和分诊中最关键的特征。

Conclusion: 这些贡献使分诊预测研究更具可复现性和可访问性，是临床AI中数据集民主化的一步。

Abstract: Research on emergency and mass casualty incident (MCI) triage has been
limited by the absence of openly usable, reproducible benchmarks. Yet these
scenarios demand rapid identification of the patients most in need, where
accurate deterioration prediction can guide timely interventions. While the
MIMIC-IV-ED database is openly available to credentialed researchers,
transforming it into a triage-focused benchmark requires extensive
preprocessing, feature harmonization, and schema alignment -- barriers that
restrict accessibility to only highly technical users.
  We address these gaps by first introducing an open, LLM-assisted emergency
triage benchmark for deterioration prediction (ICU transfer, in-hospital
mortality). The benchmark then defines two regimes: (i) a hospital-rich setting
with vitals, labs, notes, chief complaints, and structured observations, and
(ii) an MCI-like field simulation limited to vitals, observations, and notes.
Large language models (LLMs) contributed directly to dataset construction by
(i) harmonizing noisy fields such as AVPU and breathing devices, (ii)
prioritizing clinically relevant vitals and labs, and (iii) guiding schema
alignment and efficient merging of disparate tables.
  We further provide baseline models and SHAP-based interpretability analyses,
illustrating predictive gaps between regimes and the features most critical for
triage. Together, these contributions make triage prediction research more
reproducible and accessible -- a step toward dataset democratization in
clinical AI.

### [157] [Data-to-Energy Stochastic Dynamics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26364)
*Kirill Tamogashev,Nikolay Malkin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了首个通用方法用于建模薛定谔桥，当其中一个或两个分布仅通过未归一化密度给出且无法获取数据样本时。该方法基于对迭代比例拟合(IPF)过程的泛化，并展示了在生成模型潜在空间中采样后验分布的应用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的薛定谔桥算法都需要两个分布的样本数据，但在许多实际应用中，分布可能仅通过未归一化密度函数给出，无法获取样本。这限制了薛定谔桥方法在科学计算和机器学习中的应用范围。

Method: 提出数据到能量IPF方法，将迭代比例拟合过程泛化到无数据情况，借鉴了离线强化学习在扩散采样器训练中的最新进展。该方法假设动态系统具有固定的时间离散化方案。

Result: 在合成问题上验证了方法的有效性，能够成功学习多峰分布之间的传输。同时发现通过学习动态系统的扩散系数可以显著改进现有的数据到数据薛定谔桥算法。

Conclusion: 该方法为薛定谔桥问题提供了首个无数据样本的解决方案，扩展了其在科学计算中的应用，特别是在生成模型潜在空间后验采样方面，创建了无数据的图像到图像转换方法。

Abstract: The Schr\"odinger bridge problem is concerned with finding a stochastic
dynamical system bridging two marginal distributions that minimises a certain
transportation cost. This problem, which represents a generalisation of optimal
transport to the stochastic case, has received attention due to its connections
to diffusion models and flow matching, as well as its applications in the
natural sciences. However, all existing algorithms allow to infer such dynamics
only for cases where samples from both distributions are available. In this
paper, we propose the first general method for modelling Schr\"odinger bridges
when one (or both) distributions are given by their unnormalised densities,
with no access to data samples. Our algorithm relies on a generalisation of the
iterative proportional fitting (IPF) procedure to the data-free case, inspired
by recent developments in off-policy reinforcement learning for training of
diffusion samplers. We demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed data-to-energy
IPF on synthetic problems, finding that it can successfully learn transports
between multimodal distributions. As a secondary consequence of our
reinforcement learning formulation, which assumes a fixed time discretisation
scheme for the dynamics, we find that existing data-to-data Schr\"odinger
bridge algorithms can be substantially improved by learning the diffusion
coefficient of the dynamics. Finally, we apply the newly developed algorithm to
the problem of sampling posterior distributions in latent spaces of generative
models, thus creating a data-free image-to-image translation method. Code:

*Benno Kaech,Luis Wyss,Karsten Borgwardt,Gianvito Grasso*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: InVirtuoGen是一个基于离散流的生成模型，用于小分子的从头生成、片段约束生成、目标性质优化和先导化合物优化，在药物发现中建立了多功能的生成基础。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的分子生成模型在质量-多样性权衡、片段约束任务以及多目标优化方面存在局限性，需要开发更高效的生成范式。

Method: 采用离散流生成模型学习从均匀源分布到数据分布的转换，训练损失考虑所有序列位置的预测，结合遗传算法和近端性质优化微调策略进行性质优化。

Result: 在从头生成中实现了更好的质量-多样性权衡，在Practical Molecular Optimization基准测试中达到新的最先进水平，在先导化合物优化中获得了更高的对接分数。

Conclusion: InVirtuoGen为药物发现提供了一个从早期命中发现到多目标先导化合物优化的多功能生成基础，并开源了预训练模型和代码以促进可重复性。

Abstract: We introduce InVirtuoGen, a discrete flow generative model for fragmented
SMILES for de novo and fragment-constrained generation, and
target-property/lead optimization of small molecules. The model learns to
transform a uniform source over all possible tokens into the data distribution.
Unlike masked models, its training loss accounts for predictions on all
sequence positions at every denoising step, shifting the generation paradigm
from completion to refinement, and decoupling the number of sampling steps from
the sequence length. For \textit{de novo} generation, InVirtuoGen achieves a
stronger quality-diversity pareto frontier than prior fragment-based models and
competitive performance on fragment-constrained tasks. For property and lead
optimization, we propose a hybrid scheme that combines a genetic algorithm with
a Proximal Property Optimization fine-tuning strategy adapted to discrete
flows. Our approach sets a new state-of-the-art on the Practical Molecular
Optimization benchmark, measured by top-10 AUC across tasks, and yields higher
docking scores in lead optimization than previous baselines. InVirtuoGen thus
establishes a versatile generative foundation for drug discovery, from early
hit finding to multi-objective lead optimization. We further contribute to open
science by releasing pretrained checkpoints and code, making our results fully
reproducible\footnote{https://github.com/invirtuolabs/InVirtuoGen_results}.

### [159] [Ascent Fails to Forget](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26427)
*Ioannis Mavrothalassitis,Pol Puigdemont,Noam Itzhak Levi,Volkan Cevher*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 梯度上升的无约束优化方法在机器遗忘任务中经常失败，这归因于遗忘集和保留集之间的统计依赖性。即使只是简单的相关性，这种依赖关系也会导致遗忘过程损害整体模型性能，甚至可能使模型比原始状态更差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 挑战普遍认为梯度上升方法能有效进行机器遗忘的观点，揭示遗忘集和保留集之间的统计依赖性被忽视的问题，这种依赖关系会破坏遗忘过程的有效性。

Method: 通过理论和实证分析，研究梯度上升方法在机器遗忘中的失败机制。使用逻辑回归作为示例展示关键失败模式，并通过玩具示例说明模型如何陷入无法通过微调逃脱的局部最小值。

Result: 研究发现梯度上升迭代会逐渐偏离理想的重训练模型，收敛到比原始模型更差的解。在复杂神经网络上的实验证实了这些理论见解，显示这些方法在实践中表现不如预期。

Conclusion: 遗忘集和保留集之间的统计依赖性（即使只是相关性）足以导致基于上升的遗忘方法失败，这突显了在机器遗忘中考虑数据间统计关系的重要性。

Abstract: Contrary to common belief, we show that gradient ascent-based unconstrained
optimization methods frequently fail to perform machine unlearning, a
phenomenon we attribute to the inherent statistical dependence between the
forget and retain data sets. This dependence, which can manifest itself even as
simple correlations, undermines the misconception that these sets can be
independently manipulated during unlearning. We provide empirical and
theoretical evidence showing these methods often fail precisely due to this
overlooked relationship. For random forget sets, this dependence means that
degrading forget set metrics (which, for a retrained model, should mirror test
set metrics) inevitably harms overall test performance. Going beyond random
sets, we consider logistic regression as an instructive example where a
critical failure mode emerges: inter-set dependence causes gradient
descent-ascent iterations to progressively diverge from the ideal retrained
model. Strikingly, these methods can converge to solutions that are not only
far from the retrained ideal but are potentially even further from it than the
original model itself, rendering the unlearning process actively detrimental. A
toy example further illustrates how this dependence can trap models in inferior
local minima, inescapable via finetuning. Our findings highlight that the
presence of such statistical dependencies, even when manifest only as
correlations, can be sufficient for ascent-based unlearning to fail. Our
theoretical insights are corroborated by experiments on complex neural
networks, demonstrating that these methods do not perform as expected in
practice due to this unaddressed statistical interplay.

*Guanxi Lu,Hao,Chen,Yuto Karashima,Zhican Wang,Daichi Fujiki,Hongxiang Fan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文挑战了半自回归解码中固定块大小的假设，提出了AdaBlock-dLLM，一种基于语义的自适应块大小调度方法，显著提升了扩散大语言模型的解码效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统半自回归解码使用固定块大小存在两个根本问题：延迟解码开销（高置信度令牌被不必要延迟）和过早解码错误（低置信度令牌过早提交导致错误）。

Method: 通过分析去噪过程中的置信度动态，识别出波动带区域，并基于此开发了AdaBlock-dLLM调度器，在运行时自适应调整块大小以对齐语义边界。

Result: 在相同吞吐量预算下，AdaBlock-dLLM实现了高达5.3%的准确率提升，且无需额外训练，即插即用。

Conclusion: 提出的语义感知自适应调度方法和基于置信度的分析为dLLMs的未来训练策略提供了新思路。

Abstract: Diffusion-based large language models (dLLMs) are gaining attention for their
inherent capacity for parallel decoding, offering a compelling alternative to
autoregressive LLMs. Among various decoding strategies, blockwise
semi-autoregressive (semi-AR) approaches are widely adopted due to their
natural support for KV caching and their favorable accuracy-speed trade-off.
However, this paper identifies two fundamental limitations in the conventional
semi-AR decoding approach that applies a fixed block size: i) late decoding
overhead, where the unmasking of high-confidence tokens outside the current
block is unnecessarily delayed, and ii) premature decoding error, where
low-confidence tokens inside the current block are committed too early, leading
to incorrect tokens. This paper presents the first systematic investigation
challenging the fixed block size assumption in semi-AR decoding. Through a
statistical analysis of confidence dynamics during the denoising process, we
identify a volatility band (VB) region during dLLM decoding, which encodes
local semantic structure and can be used to guide adaptive block sizing.
Leveraging these insights, we introduce AdaBlock-dLLM, a training-free,
plug-and-play scheduler that adaptively aligns block boundaries with semantic
steps by adjusting block size during runtime. Extensive experiments across
diverse benchmarks show that AdaBlock-dLLM achieves up to 5.3% accuracy
improvement under the same throughput budget. Beyond inference-time
optimization, we hope our semantics-aware adaptive scheduling approach and
confidence-based analysis will inspire future training strategies for dLLMs.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ACT将决策树方法扩展到非结构化文本数据，通过将每个分裂点表示为自然语言问题，结合TextGrad的LLM反馈进行优化，在保持透明性和可解释性的同时达到或超越基于提示的方法的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在高风险AI应用中，需要透明、可解释和可审计的决策系统。传统决策树仅适用于结构化数据，而LLM在处理非结构化文本时缺乏可信赖的行为保证。

Method: ACT将决策树的每个分裂点表示为自然语言问题，通过基于不纯度的评估和TextGrad的LLM反馈来优化这些问题，构建可解释的分类树。

Result: 在文本基准测试中，ACT达到或超越了基于提示的基线方法，同时产生透明和可解释的决策路径。

Conclusion: ACT成功地将决策树的透明性和可解释性扩展到非结构化文本数据，为高风险AI应用提供了可信赖的解决方案。

Abstract: When used in high-stakes settings, AI systems are expected to produce
decisions that are transparent, interpretable, and auditable, a requirement
increasingly expected by regulations. Decision trees such as CART provide clear
and verifiable rules, but they are restricted to structured tabular data and
cannot operate directly on unstructured inputs such as text. In practice, large
language models (LLMs) are widely used for such data, yet prompting strategies
such as chain-of-thought or prompt optimization still rely on free-form
reasoning, limiting their ability to ensure trustworthy behaviors. We present
the Agentic Classification Tree (ACT), which extends decision-tree methodology
to unstructured inputs by formulating each split as a natural-language
question, refined through impurity-based evaluation and LLM feedback via
TextGrad. Experiments on text benchmarks show that ACT matches or surpasses
prompting-based baselines while producing transparent and interpretable
decision paths.

*Xinyu Liu,Zixuan Xie,Shangtong Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 扩展Robbins-Siegmund定理，放宽零阶项的可和性要求，为强化学习中Q-learning等算法提供收敛性分析。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 原始Robbins-Siegmund定理要求零阶项可和，但在许多重要强化学习应用中这一条件无法满足，限制了其应用范围。

Method: 引入对随机过程增量的新假设，结合平方可和条件，证明几乎必然收敛到有界集。

Result: 获得了几乎必然收敛速率、高概率集中界和L^p收敛速率，首次为带线性函数逼近的Q-learning提供了这些收敛性结果。

Conclusion: 扩展的Robbins-Siegmund定理为更广泛的随机迭代算法提供了收敛性分析工具，特别适用于强化学习中的关键应用。

Abstract: The Robbins-Siegmund theorem establishes the convergence of stochastic
processes that are almost supermartingales and is foundational for analyzing a
wide range of stochastic iterative algorithms in stochastic approximation and
reinforcement learning (RL). However, its original form has a significant
limitation as it requires the zero-order term to be summable. In many important
RL applications, this summable condition, however, cannot be met. This
limitation motivates us to extend the Robbins-Siegmund theorem for almost
supermartingales where the zero-order term is not summable but only square
summable. Particularly, we introduce a novel and mild assumption on the
increments of the stochastic processes. This together with the square summable
condition enables an almost sure convergence to a bounded set. Additionally, we
further provide almost sure convergence rates, high probability concentration
bounds, and $L^p$ convergence rates. We then apply the new results in
stochastic approximation and RL. Notably, we obtain the first almost sure
convergence rate, the first high probability concentration bound, and the first
$L^p$ convergence rate for $Q$-learning with linear function approximation.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试存在领域覆盖窄、忽视协变量任务、缺乏统计严谨性、难以集成到现有工作流等问题，阻碍了时间序列预测领域的持续进步。

Method: 开发了包含100个预测任务的fev-bench基准测试，涵盖7个领域（其中46个任务包含协变量），并创建了fev轻量级Python库支持可复现的模型评估。

Result: 使用fev-bench评估了各种预训练、统计和基线模型，通过胜率和技能得分两个维度报告性能，并确定了未来研究方向。

Conclusion: fev-bench和fev库解决了现有基准测试的关键缺陷，为时间序列预测提供了更全面、严谨和实用的评估框架。

Abstract: Benchmark quality is critical for meaningful evaluation and sustained
progress in time series forecasting, particularly given the recent rise of
pretrained models. Existing benchmarks often have narrow domain coverage or
overlook important real-world settings, such as tasks with covariates.
Additionally, their aggregation procedures often lack statistical rigor, making
it unclear whether observed performance differences reflect true improvements
or random variation. Many benchmarks also fail to provide infrastructure for
consistent evaluation or are too rigid to integrate into existing pipelines. To
address these gaps, we propose fev-bench, a benchmark comprising 100
forecasting tasks across seven domains, including 46 tasks with covariates.
Supporting the benchmark, we introduce fev, a lightweight Python library for
benchmarking forecasting models that emphasizes reproducibility and seamless
integration with existing workflows. Usingfev, fev-bench employs principled
aggregation methods with bootstrapped confidence intervals to report model
performance along two complementary dimensions: win rates and skill scores. We
report results on fev-bench for various pretrained, statistical and baseline
models, and identify promising directions for future research.

*Mohammad Hassan Vali,Tom Bäckström,Arno Solin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了DiVeQ和SF-DiVeQ两种向量量化方法，通过将量化视为添加模拟量化失真的误差向量，保持前向传播的硬分配同时允许梯度流动，实现端到端训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统向量量化中的硬分配会阻断梯度，阻碍端到端训练。需要一种既能保持硬分配优势又能支持梯度传播的量化方法。

Method: DiVeQ将量化建模为添加模拟量化失真的误差向量；SF-DiVeQ进一步将分配扩展到由码字连线构成的曲线上，减少量化误差并充分利用码本。两种方法都不需要辅助损失或温度调度。

Result: 在VQ-VAE压缩和VQGAN生成任务上，在多个数据集上相比其他量化方法提升了重建质量和样本质量。

Conclusion: DiVeQ和SF-DiVeQ是有效的向量量化方法，能够实现端到端训练，在压缩和生成任务中表现出色。

Abstract: Vector quantization is common in deep models, yet its hard assignments block
gradients and hinder end-to-end training. We propose DiVeQ, which treats
quantization as adding an error vector that mimics the quantization distortion,
keeping the forward pass hard while letting gradients flow. We also present a
space-filling variant (SF-DiVeQ) that assigns to a curve constructed by the
lines connecting codewords, resulting in less quantization error and full
codebook usage. Both methods train end-to-end without requiring auxiliary
losses or temperature schedules. On VQ-VAE compression and VQGAN generation
across various data sets, they improve reconstruction and sample quality over
alternative quantization approaches.

Conclusion: 局部正则化范式为等变神经网络提供了更高效的实现方案，使等变性能够更便捷地集成到标准神经网络架构中。

Abstract: Equivariant neural networks offer strong inductive biases for learning from
molecular and geometric data but often rely on specialized, computationally
expensive tensor operations. We present a framework to transfers existing
tensor field networks into the more efficient local canonicalization paradigm,
preserving equivariance while significantly improving the runtime. Within this
framework, we systematically compare different equivariant representations in
terms of theoretical complexity, empirical runtime, and predictive accuracy. We
publish the tensor_frames package, a PyTorchGeometric based implementation for
local canonicalization, that enables straightforward integration of
equivariance into any standard message passing neural network.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出EAT（Entropy After </Think>）方法，通过监控推理过程中的熵变化来检测和防止大语言模型的过度思考问题，实现自适应计算分配，减少13-21%的token使用而不影响准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在长链推理中表现出过度思考的倾向，即使已得到正确答案仍继续修正，造成token浪费。需要一种方法来检测和防止这种低效行为。

Method: 在推理过程中添加停止思考标记</think>，监控后续token的熵变化轨迹，当Pass@1达到平台期时熵会下降并稳定，通过指数移动平均的方差阈值实现早期停止推理。

Result: 在MATH500和AIME2025数据集上，EAT方法减少13-21%的token使用，且不损害准确性。在黑盒设置下（无法访问推理模型logits）也保持有效。

Conclusion: EAT提供了一种简单有效的方法来监控和防止大语言模型的过度思考问题，实现自适应计算分配，提高推理效率。

Abstract: Large reasoning models show improved performance with longer chains of
thought. However, recent work has highlighted (qualitatively) their tendency to
overthink, continuing to revise answers even after reaching the correct
solution. We quantitatively confirm this inefficiency by tracking Pass@1 for
answers averaged over a large number of rollouts and find that the model often
begins to always produce the correct answer early in the reasoning, making
extra reasoning a waste of tokens. To detect and prevent overthinking, we
propose a simple and inexpensive novel signal -- Entropy After </Think> (EAT)
-- for monitoring and deciding whether to exit reasoning early. By appending a
stop thinking token (</think>) and monitoring the entropy of the following
token as the model reasons, we obtain a trajectory that decreases and
stabilizes when Pass@1 plateaus; thresholding its variance under an exponential
moving average yields a practical stopping rule. Importantly, our approach
enables adaptively allocating compute based on the EAT trajectory, allowing us
to spend compute in a more efficient way compared with fixing the token budget
for all questions. Empirically, on MATH500 and AIME2025, EAT reduces token
usage by 13 - 21% without harming accuracy, and it remains effective in black
box settings where logits from the reasoning model are not accessible, and EAT

*Seohyun Lee,Wenzhi Fang,Dong-Jun Han,Seyyedali Hosseinalipour,Christopher G. Brinton*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了TAP（两阶段自适应个性化）方法，通过客户端-服务器不匹配的模型架构和知识蒸馏来个性化多任务多模态基础模型的联邦学习


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有联邦学习产生的最终模型不一定适合每个客户端的需求，特别是在数据、任务和模态都存在异构性的场景下，缺乏对多任务多模态基础模型进行个性化微调的研究

Method: TAP方法包含两个阶段：(i)利用客户端和服务器间不匹配的模型架构，在有益于客户端本地任务时选择性进行替换操作；(ii)在联邦学习后进行知识蒸馏，捕获有益通用知识而不损害个性化

Result: 通过大量实验验证了所提算法在各种数据集和任务上的有效性，优于多个基线方法，并提供了服务器模型在模态-任务对架构下的收敛性分析

Conclusion: TAP方法能够有效解决异构联邦学习环境下的个性化问题，特别是在多任务多模态基础模型场景中表现优异

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL), despite demonstrating impressive capabilities in the
training of multiple models in a decentralized manner, has been shown to
produce a final model not necessarily well-suited to the needs of each client.
While extensive work has been conducted on how to create tailored personalized
models, called Personalized Federated Learning (PFL), less attention has been
given to personalization via fine-tuning of foundation models with multi-task
and multi-modal properties. Moreover, there exists a lack of understanding in
the literature on how to fine-tune and personalize such models in a setting
that is heterogeneous across clients not only in data, but also in tasks and
modalities. To address this gap in the literature, we propose TAP (Two-Stage
Adaptive Personalization), which (i) leverages mismatched model architectures
between the clients and server to selectively conduct replacement operations
when it benefits a client's local tasks and (ii) engages in post-FL knowledge
distillation for capturing beneficial general knowledge without compromising
personalization. We also introduce the first convergence analysis of the server
model under its modality-task pair architecture, and demonstrate that as the
number of modality-task pairs increases, its ability to cater to all tasks
suffers. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our
proposed algorithm across a variety of datasets and tasks in comparison to a
multitude of baselines. Implementation code is publicly available at
https://github.com/lee3296/TAP.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着关键基础设施日益复杂且依赖度增加，电力系统成为网络攻击的诱人目标，特别是新型的不稳定攻击缺乏有效防护措施。

Method: 使用监督机器学习模型，在IEEE 14总线系统上进行概念验证，采用改进的Prony分析(MPA)来检测不稳定攻击。

Result: 证明MPA是检测不稳定攻击并触发防御机制的有效方法。

Conclusion: 该方法为电力系统提供了一种经济有效的防御不稳定攻击的解决方案。

Abstract: Every year critical infrastructure becomes more complex and we grow to rely
on it more and more. With this reliance, it becomes an attractive target for
cyberattacks from sophisticated actors, with one of the most attractive targets
being the power grid. One class of attacks, instability attacks, is a newer
type of attack that has relatively few protections developed. We present a cost
effective, data-driven approach to training a supervised machine learning model
to retrofit load shedding decision systems in power grids with the capacity to
defend against instability attacks. We show a proof of concept on the IEEE 14
Bus System using the Achilles Heel Technologies Power Grid Analyzer, and show
through an implementation of modified Prony analysis (MPA) that MPA is a viable
method for detecting instability attacks and triggering defense mechanisms.

Motivation: 开发一种可解释性方法，能够根据训练好的神经网络来衡量数据点之间的相似性，帮助理解模型如何组织和分类数据。

Method: 构建损失核作为低损失参数扰动分布下计算的样本损失协方差矩阵，通过参数扰动来捕捉模型对数据相似性的理解。

Conclusion: 损失核是实用的可解释性和数据归因工具，能够揭示神经网络内部的数据组织结构。

Abstract: We introduce the loss kernel, an interpretability method for measuring
similarity between data points according to a trained neural network. The
kernel is the covariance matrix of per-sample losses computed under a
distribution of low-loss-preserving parameter perturbations. We first validate
our method on a synthetic multitask problem, showing it separates inputs by
task as predicted by theory. We then apply this kernel to Inception-v1 to
visualize the structure of ImageNet, and we show that the kernel's structure
aligns with the WordNet semantic hierarchy. This establishes the loss kernel as
a practical tool for interpretability and data attribution.

Motivation: 传统影响函数在深度神经网络中面临Hessian矩阵不可逆和高维参数空间的挑战，限制了其在现代大规模神经网络中的应用。

Method: 使用随机梯度MCMC采样估计损失景观统计，替代Hessian逆矩阵计算，构建Hessian-free的局部贝叶斯影响函数。

Result: 该方法能够捕捉参数间的高阶交互作用，并高效扩展到数十亿参数的神经网络，在重训练实验预测方面达到了最先进的结果。

Conclusion: 局部贝叶斯影响函数为深度神经网络提供了一种可扩展且有效的影响分析工具，克服了传统方法的局限性。

Abstract: Classical influence functions face significant challenges when applied to
deep neural networks, primarily due to non-invertible Hessians and
high-dimensional parameter spaces. We propose the local Bayesian influence
function (BIF), an extension of classical influence functions that replaces
Hessian inversion with loss landscape statistics that can be estimated via
stochastic-gradient MCMC sampling. This Hessian-free approach captures
higher-order interactions among parameters and scales efficiently to neural
networks with billions of parameters. We demonstrate state-of-the-art results
on predicting retraining experiments.

Abstract: We introduce Panama, an active learning framework to train parametric guitar
amp models end-to-end using a combination of an LSTM model and a WaveNet-like

that are determined through an ensemble-based active learning strategy to
minimize the amount of datapoints needed (i.e., amp knob settings). Our
strategy uses gradient-based optimization to maximize the disagreement among
ensemble models, in order to identify the most informative datapoints. MUSHRA
listening tests reveal that, with 75 datapoints, our models are able to match
the perceptual quality of NAM, the leading open-source non-parametric amp

TL;DR: 使用有限元框架生成合成胸主动脉瘤，通过神经网络预测初始损伤组合，发现结合扩张性和可扩张性数据能显著提高预测准确性，UNet模型表现最佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 胸主动脉瘤由多种机械和机械生物学破坏引起，不同损伤造成不同的机械脆弱性，需要识别驱动疾病进展的相互作用因素。

Method: 使用有限元框架生成数百种异质性损伤的合成胸主动脉瘤，构建局部扩张和可扩张性的空间图，训练神经网络预测初始损伤组合，比较多种架构和数据格式。

Result: 仅使用扩张性数据时预测误差显著更高，结合扩张性和可扩张性数据能提高准确性；UNet在所有数据格式中表现最准确。

Conclusion: 在胸主动脉瘤评估中获取扩张性和可扩张性的全场测量至关重要，能揭示疾病的机械生物学驱动因素，支持个性化治疗策略的开发。

Abstract: Thoracic aortic aneurysms (TAAs) arise from diverse mechanical and
mechanobiological disruptions to the aortic wall that increase the risk of
dissection or rupture. Evidence links TAA development to dysfunctions in the
aortic mechanotransduction axis, including loss of elastic fiber integrity and
cell-matrix connections. Because distinct insults create different mechanical
vulnerabilities, there is a critical need to identify interacting factors that
drive progression. Here, we use a finite element framework to generate
synthetic TAAs from hundreds of heterogeneous insults spanning varying degrees
of elastic fiber damage and impaired mechanosensing. From these simulations, we
construct spatial maps of localized dilatation and distensibility to train
neural networks that predict the initiating combined insult. We compare several
architectures (Deep Operator Networks, UNets, and Laplace Neural Operators) and
multiple input data formats to define a standard for future subject-specific
modeling. We also quantify predictive performance when networks are trained
using only geometric data (dilatation) versus both geometric and mechanical
data (dilatation plus distensibility). Across all networks, prediction errors
are significantly higher when trained on dilatation alone, underscoring the
added value of distensibility information. Among the tested models, UNet
consistently provides the highest accuracy across all data formats. These
findings highlight the importance of acquiring full-field measurements of both
dilatation and distensibility in TAA assessment to reveal the mechanobiological
drivers of disease and support the development of personalized treatment
strategies.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出条件奖励建模（CRM）方法，通过将LLM推理建模为时间过程，将每个推理步骤的奖励与最终结果明确关联，解决现有过程奖励模型中的信用分配模糊问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有过程奖励模型要么孤立处理推理步骤，要么难以将过程奖励与最终结果对齐，导致奖励信号不尊重时序因果关系，存在信用分配模糊问题，使下游模型易受奖励攻击。

Method: 将LLM推理建模为时间过程，每个推理步骤的奖励不仅基于前序步骤，还明确与推理轨迹的最终结果关联，通过强制执行条件概率规则来捕捉推理步骤间的因果关系。

Result: 在Best-of-N采样、波束搜索和强化学习的实验中，CRM始终优于现有奖励模型，对奖励攻击更鲁棒，无需依赖基于真实值的可验证奖励即可提供稳定的下游改进。

Conclusion: CRM为增强LLM推理提供了一个原则性框架，通过精确的信用分配和可靠的跨样本比较，解决了过程奖励建模中的关键挑战。

Abstract: Process Reward Models (PRMs) have emerged as a promising approach to enhance
the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) by guiding their
step-by-step reasoning toward a final answer. However, existing PRMs either
treat each reasoning step in isolation, failing to capture inter-step
dependencies, or struggle to align process rewards with the final outcome.
Consequently, the reward signal fails to respect temporal causality in
sequential reasoning and faces ambiguous credit assignment. These limitations
make downstream models vulnerable to reward hacking and lead to suboptimal
performance. In this work, we propose Conditional Reward Modeling (CRM) that
frames LLM reasoning as a temporal process leading to a correct answer. The
reward of each reasoning step is not only conditioned on the preceding steps
but also explicitly linked to the final outcome of the reasoning trajectory. By
enforcing conditional probability rules, our design captures the causal
relationships among reasoning steps, with the link to the outcome allowing
precise attribution of each intermediate step, thereby resolving credit
assignment ambiguity. Further, through this consistent probabilistic modeling,
the rewards produced by CRM enable more reliable cross-sample comparison.
Experiments across Best-of-N sampling, beam search and reinforcement learning
demonstrate that CRM consistently outperforms existing reward models, offering
a principled framework for enhancing LLM reasoning. In particular, CRM is more
robust to reward hacking and delivers stable downstream improvements without
relying on verifiable rewards derived from ground truth.

### [174] [Clarification as Supervision: Reinforcement Learning for Vision-Language Interfaces](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26594)
*John Gkountouras,Ivan Titov*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出AC-RL方法，通过交互训练视觉模型生成包含推理所需关键信息的图像描述，解决当前模型因忽略细节导致推理失败的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视觉语言模型生成的图像描述为人类读者设计，常省略推理系统所需的精确细节，导致推理失败不是由于推理能力限制，而是缺乏关键视觉信息。

Method: AC-RL通过交互训练，利用澄清请求揭示信息缺口，惩罚需要澄清的成功案例，促使模型生成全面的初始描述，使推理器能一次性解决问题。

Result: 在7个视觉数学推理基准测试中，AC-RL比预训练基线平均准确率提高4.4个百分点，分析显示如果允许澄清请求可减少高达39%。

Conclusion: AC-RL证明仅通过交互学习即可有效训练视觉语言接口，无需显式标注，澄清请求可作为隐式监督形式。

Abstract: Recent text-only models demonstrate remarkable mathematical reasoning
capabilities. Extending these to visual domains requires vision-language models
to translate images into text descriptions. However, current models, trained to
produce captions for human readers, often omit the precise details that
reasoning systems require. This creates an interface mismatch: reasoners often
fail not due to reasoning limitations but because they lack access to critical
visual information. We propose Adaptive-Clarification Reinforcement Learning
(AC-RL), which teaches vision models what information reasoners need through
interaction. Our key insight is that clarification requests during training
reveal information gaps; by penalizing success that requires clarification, we
create pressure for comprehensive initial captions that enable the reasoner to
solve the problem in a single pass. AC-RL improves average accuracy by 4.4
points over pretrained baselines across seven visual mathematical reasoning
benchmarks, and analysis shows it would cut clarification requests by up to 39%
if those were allowed. By treating clarification as a form of implicit
supervision, AC-RL demonstrates that vision-language interfaces can be
effectively learned through interaction alone, without requiring explicit
annotations.

TL;DR: 提出基于适当评分规则的回归不确定性量化统一框架，能够自然分解为偶然性和认知性不确定性，并在实际参数假设下推导出闭式表达式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机器学习预测的不确定性量化对于安全关键应用至关重要，但现有进展主要集中在分类任务，回归任务的不确定性量化仍然具有挑战性。

Method: 基于适当评分规则（如CRPS、对数、平方误差和二次评分）构建统一框架，在实际参数假设下推导闭式表达式，并使用模型集成进行估计。

Result: 推导出的不确定性度量自然分解为偶然性和认知性成分，恢复了基于预测方差和微分熵的流行回归UQ度量。在合成和真实数据集上的广泛评估为选择可靠的UQ度量提供了指导。

Conclusion: 该框架为回归任务提供了可靠的不确定性量化方法，能够有效分解不同类型的不确定性，为安全关键应用提供决策支持。

Abstract: Quantifying uncertainty of machine learning model predictions is essential
for reliable decision-making, especially in safety-critical applications.
Recently, uncertainty quantification (UQ) theory has advanced significantly,
building on a firm basis of learning with proper scoring rules. However, these
advances were focused on classification, while extending these ideas to
regression remains challenging. In this work, we introduce a unified UQ
framework for regression based on proper scoring rules, such as CRPS,
logarithmic, squared error, and quadratic scores. We derive closed-form
expressions for the resulting uncertainty measures under practical parametric
assumptions and show how to estimate them using ensembles of models. In
particular, the derived uncertainty measures naturally decompose into aleatoric
and epistemic components. The framework recovers popular regression UQ measures
based on predictive variance and differential entropy. Our broad evaluation on
synthetic and real-world regression datasets provides guidance for selecting
reliable UQ measures.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LLMs在纯文本训练中意外地发展出丰富的视觉先验知识，这些先验可分为感知先验和推理先验，具有不同的扩展趋势和来源。推理先验主要来自代码、数学等推理中心数据，而感知先验则来自广泛语料库。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 揭示LLMs在纯文本预训练中如何获得视觉能力，理解视觉先验的组成和来源，为构建下一代多模态LLMs提供理论基础。

Method: 通过100多个控制实验（消耗50万GPU小时），涵盖完整的MLLM构建流程，包括LLM预训练、视觉对齐和监督多模态微调，分析不同数据类别和混合对视觉先验的影响。

Result: 发现推理先验主要来自推理中心数据，具有可转移性和通用性；感知先验更依赖视觉编码器和视觉指令调优数据；视觉世界描述文本虽然重要但性能影响快速饱和。

Conclusion: 提出了一种基于数据中心的预训练方法，为从语言预训练中刻意培养视觉先验提供了新途径，推动了下一代多模态LLMs的发展。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), despite being trained on text alone,
surprisingly develop rich visual priors. These priors allow latent visual
capabilities to be unlocked for vision tasks with a relatively small amount of
multimodal data, and in some cases, to perform visual tasks without ever having
seen an image. Through systematic analysis, we reveal that visual priors-the
implicit, emergent knowledge about the visual world acquired during language
pre-training-are composed of separable perception and reasoning priors with
unique scaling trends and origins. We show that an LLM's latent visual
reasoning ability is predominantly developed by pre-training on
reasoning-centric data (e.g., code, math, academia) and scales progressively.
This reasoning prior acquired from language pre-training is transferable and
universally applicable to visual reasoning. In contrast, a perception prior
emerges more diffusely from broad corpora, and perception ability is more
sensitive to the vision encoder and visual instruction tuning data. In
parallel, text describing the visual world proves crucial, though its
performance impact saturates rapidly. Leveraging these insights, we propose a
data-centric recipe for pre-training vision-aware LLMs and verify it in 1T
token scale pre-training. Our findings are grounded in over 100 controlled
experiments consuming 500,000 GPU-hours, spanning the full MLLM construction
pipeline-from LLM pre-training to visual alignment and supervised multimodal
fine-tuning-across five model scales, a wide range of data categories and
mixtures, and multiple adaptation setups. Along with our main findings, we
propose and investigate several hypotheses, and introduce the Multi-Level
Existence Bench (MLE-Bench). Together, this work provides a new way of
deliberately cultivating visual priors from language pre-training, paving the
way for the next generation of multimodal LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有测试时扩展方法要么是并行选择多个独立解，要么是顺序自我优化，但都未能充分利用推理链中的丰富信息。RSA旨在结合两者的优势，利用部分正确的中间步骤来提升推理能力。

Method: RSA通过迭代方式精化候选推理链：每一步都聚合子集来生成改进的解群，作为下一轮的候选池。该方法利用推理链中的中间信息，从不同思维链的部分正确步骤中自举学习。

Result: RSA在不同任务、模型家族和规模上都带来了显著的性能提升。Qwen3-4B-Instruct-2507使用RSA后能与更大的推理模型竞争，在AIME-25、HMMT-25等多个基准测试中优于纯并行和顺序扩展策略。

Conclusion: RSA是一种有效的测试时扩展方法，通过结合并行和顺序推理的优势，充分利用推理链信息，显著提升模型性能。通过聚合感知的强化学习训练可进一步获得性能增益。

Abstract: Test-time scaling methods improve the capabilities of large language models
(LLMs) by increasing the amount of compute used during inference to make a
prediction. Inference-time compute can be scaled in parallel by choosing among
multiple independent solutions or sequentially through self-refinement. We
propose Recursive Self-Aggregation (RSA), a test-time scaling method inspired
by evolutionary methods that combines the benefits of both parallel and
sequential scaling. Each step of RSA refines a population of candidate
reasoning chains through aggregation of subsets to yield a population of
improved solutions, which are then used as the candidate pool for the next
iteration. RSA exploits the rich information embedded in the reasoning chains
-- not just the final answers -- and enables bootstrapping from partially
correct intermediate steps within different chains of thought. Empirically, RSA
delivers substantial performance gains with increasing compute budgets across
diverse tasks, model families and sizes. Notably, RSA enables
Qwen3-4B-Instruct-2507 to achieve competitive performance with larger reasoning
models, including DeepSeek-R1 and o3-mini (high), while outperforming purely
parallel and sequential scaling strategies across AIME-25, HMMT-25, Reasoning
Gym, LiveCodeBench-v6, and SuperGPQA. We further demonstrate that training the
model to combine solutions via a novel aggregation-aware reinforcement learning
approach yields significant performance gains. Code available at

Conclusion: AttnRL框架通过高效探索机制显著提升了过程监督强化学习在推理任务中的效果和效率。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has shown remarkable success in enhancing the
reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). Process-Supervised RL
(PSRL) has emerged as a more effective paradigm compared to outcome-based RL.
However, existing PSRL approaches suffer from limited exploration efficiency,
both in terms of branching positions and sampling. In this paper, we introduce
a novel PSRL framework (AttnRL), which enables efficient exploration for
reasoning models. Motivated by preliminary observations that steps exhibiting
high attention scores correlate with reasoning behaviors, we propose to branch
from positions with high values. Furthermore, we develop an adaptive sampling
strategy that accounts for problem difficulty and historical batch size,
ensuring that the whole training batch maintains non-zero advantage values. To
further improve sampling efficiency, we design a one-step off-policy training
pipeline for PSRL. Extensive experiments on multiple challenging mathematical
reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms prior
approaches in terms of performance and sampling and training efficiency.

TL;DR: AccidentBench是一个大规模多模态基准测试，结合车辆事故场景和空中、水上安全关键场景，包含约2000个视频和19000个标注问答对，用于评估模型在现实安全关键环境中的时空推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态模型的快速发展需要能够严格评估在安全关键、动态现实环境中理解和推理能力的基准测试。

Method: 构建包含车辆事故场景和空中、水上安全关键场景的大规模基准测试，涵盖不同视频长度和难度级别，系统性地测试时间、空间和意图理解推理能力。

Result: 对最先进模型（如Gemini-2.5 Pro和GPT-5）的评估显示，即使在最困难任务和最长时间视频上，最强模型也仅达到约18%的准确率，揭示了在现实世界时空和意图推理方面的显著差距。

Conclusion: AccidentBench旨在暴露这些关键差距，推动开发更安全、更稳健、更符合现实世界安全关键挑战的多模态模型。

Abstract: Rapid advances in multimodal models demand benchmarks that rigorously
evaluate understanding and reasoning in safety-critical, dynamic real-world
settings. We present AccidentBench, a large-scale benchmark that combines
vehicle accident scenarios with Beyond domains, safety-critical settings in air
and water that emphasize spatial and temporal reasoning (e.g., navigation,
orientation, multi-vehicle motion). The benchmark contains approximately 2000
videos and over 19000 human-annotated question--answer pairs spanning multiple
video lengths (short/medium/long) and difficulty levels (easy/medium/hard).
Tasks systematically probe core capabilities: temporal, spatial, and intent
understanding and reasoning. By unifying accident-centric traffic scenes with
broader safety-critical scenarios in air and water, AccidentBench offers a
comprehensive, physically grounded testbed for evaluating models under
real-world variability. Evaluations of state-of-the-art models (e.g.,
Gemini-2.5 Pro and GPT-5) show that even the strongest models achieve only
about 18% accuracy on the hardest tasks and longest videos, revealing
substantial gaps in real-world temporal, spatial, and intent reasoning.
AccidentBench is designed to expose these critical gaps and drive the
development of multimodal models that are safer, more robust, and better
aligned with real-world safety-critical challenges. The code and dataset are

TL;DR: SPATA是一种确定性方法，可将表格数据集转换为统计模式的领域无关表示，用于生成更详细透明的数据卡片，支持在不泄露数据的情况下进行AI模型鲁棒性评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于AI对数据扰动和对抗样本的敏感性，在部署前需要进行彻底的鲁棒性评估。但传统方法需要访问训练和测试数据集，这会带来数据隐私和机密性风险。需要一种允许外部验证AI而不泄露私有数据集的方法。

Method: 提出系统性模式分析(SPATA)，将每个数据实例投影到离散空间中进行分析和比较，避免数据泄露。该方法生成领域无关的统计模式表示。

Result: SPATA生成的投影数据集可以可靠地用于评估不同特征如何影响ML模型鲁棒性，并生成模型行为的可解释说明。

Conclusion: SPATA方法有助于提高处理机密数据或关键基础设施组织的透明度，为更可信的AI做出贡献。

Abstract: Due to the susceptibility of Artificial Intelligence (AI) to data
perturbations and adversarial examples, it is crucial to perform a thorough
robustness evaluation before any Machine Learning (ML) model is deployed.
However, examining a model's decision boundaries and identifying potential
vulnerabilities typically requires access to the training and testing datasets,
which may pose risks to data privacy and confidentiality. To improve
transparency in organizations that handle confidential data or manage critical
infrastructure, it is essential to allow external verification and validation
of AI without the disclosure of private datasets. This paper presents
Systematic Pattern Analysis (SPATA), a deterministic method that converts any
tabular dataset to a domain-independent representation of its statistical
patterns, to provide more detailed and transparent data cards. SPATA computes
the projection of each data instance into a discrete space where they can be
analyzed and compared, without risking data leakage. These projected datasets
can be reliably used for the evaluation of how different features affect ML
model robustness and for the generation of interpretable explanations of their
behavior, contributing to more trustworthy AI.

Abstract: This paper presents the Accurate Google Cloud Simulator (AGOCS) - a novel
high-fidelity Cloud workload simulator based on parsing real workload traces,
which can be conveniently used on a desktop machine for day-to-day research.
Our simulation is based on real-world workload traces from a Google Cluster
with 12.5K nodes, over a period of a calendar month. The framework is able to
reveal very precise and detailed parameters of the executed jobs, tasks and
nodes as well as to provide actual resource usage statistics. The system has
been implemented in Scala language with focus on parallel execution and an
easy-to-extend design concept. The paper presents the detailed structural
framework for AGOCS and discusses our main design decisions, whilst also
suggesting alternative and possibly performance enhancing future approaches.
The framework is available via the Open Source GitHub repository.

### [182] [Efficient Construction of Large Search Spaces for Auto-Tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26253)
*Floris-Jan Willemsen,Rob V. van Nieuwpoort,Ben van Werkhoven*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: 本文提出将基于约束的自动调优搜索空间构建重新表述为约束满足问题(CSP)，通过优化CSP求解器显著提升了搜索空间构建效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动性能调优中搜索空间构建可能耗时数分钟到数天，成为主要瓶颈。现有技术如链式树方法缺乏理论基础且仅适用于特定子集。

Method: 将搜索空间构建重新表述为CSP问题，开发运行时解析器将用户约束转换为求解器优化表达式，优化求解器以利用自动调优约束的常见结构。

Result: 优化求解器相比暴力枚举减少4个数量级构建时间，相比未优化CSP求解器减少3个数量级，相比链式树框架减少1-2个数量级。

Conclusion: 该方法消除了自动调优的关键可扩展性障碍，为探索先前无法达到的问题规模提供了即插即用解决方案。

Abstract: Automatic performance tuning, or auto-tuning, accelerates high-performance
codes by exploring vast spaces of code variants. However, due to the large
number of possible combinations and complex constraints, constructing these
search spaces can be a major bottleneck. Real-world applications have been
encountered where the search space construction takes minutes to hours or even
days. Current state-of-the-art techniques for search space construction, such
as chain-of-trees, lack a formal foundation and only perform adequately on a
specific subset of search spaces.
  We show that search space construction for constraint-based auto-tuning can
be reformulated as a Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP). Building on this
insight with a CSP solver, we develop a runtime parser that translates
user-defined constraint functions into solver-optimal expressions, optimize the
solver to exploit common structures in auto-tuning constraints, and integrate
these and other advances in open-source tools. These contributions
substantially improve performance and accessibility while preserving
flexibility.
  We evaluate our approach using a diverse set of benchmarks, demonstrating
that our optimized solver reduces construction time by four orders of magnitude
versus brute-force enumeration, three orders of magnitude versus an unoptimized
CSP solver, and one to two orders of magnitude versus leading auto-tuning
frameworks built on chain-of-trees. We thus eliminate a critical scalability
barrier for auto-tuning and provide a drop-in solution that enables the
exploration of previously unattainable problem scales in auto-tuning and
related domains.

### [183] [Permuting Transactions in Ethereum Blocks: An Empirical Study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25415)
*Jan Droll*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: 分析随机化交易排序在以太坊中的技术可行性，发现约22%的区块排列因协议违规而无效，主要涉及私有挖矿交易或接近gas限制的区块。只有6%的交易显示gas消耗偏差，98%的区块排列与原gas消耗偏差不超过10%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究随机化交易排序是否能缓解以太坊生态的中心化效应和改善公平性，同时评估其技术部署可行性。

Method: 对超过335,000个以太坊主网区块的交易进行多次排列和执行，量化协议违规、执行错误和gas消耗偏差。

Result: 22%的区块排列因协议违规而无效；几乎所有在排列中出现执行错误但在原始顺序中正常的交易都是私有挖矿交易；仅6%的交易显示gas消耗偏差；98%的区块排列与原gas消耗偏差不超过10%。

Conclusion: 从技术角度看，如果交易选择处理得当，随机化交易排序可能是可行的。

Abstract: Several recent proposals implicitly or explicitly suggest making use of
randomized transaction ordering within a block to mitigate centralization
effects and to improve fairness in the Ethereum ecosystem. However,
transactions and blocks are subject to gas limits and protocol rules. In a
randomized transaction order, the behavior of transactions may change depending
on other transactions in the same block, leading to invalid blocks and varying
gas consumptions. In this paper, we quantify and characterize protocol
violations, execution errors and deviations in gas consumption of blocks and
transactions to examine technical deployability. For that, we permute and
execute the transactions of over 335,000 Ethereum Mainnet blocks multiple
times. About 22% of block permutations are invalid due to protocol violations
caused by privately mined transactions or blocks close to their gas limit.
Also, almost all transactions which show execution errors under permutation but
not in the original order are privately mined transactions. Only 6% of
transactions show deviations in gas consumption and 98% of block permutations
deviate at most 10% from their original gas consumption. From a technical
perspective, these results suggest that randomized transaction ordering may be
feasible if transaction selection is handled carefully.

### [184] [Enhancing Split Learning with Sharded and Blockchain-Enabled SplitFed Approaches](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25555)
*Amirreza Sokhankhosh,Khalid Hassan,Sara Rouhani*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: 提出了两种新颖的框架：分片式SplitFed学习（SSFL）和区块链驱动的SplitFed学习（BSFL），以解决SplitFed学习（SFL）的可扩展性、性能和安全性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦学习（FL）和分割学习（SL）存在关键限制——FL对客户端计算要求高，SL训练时间长。SFL作为混合方法虽然结合了两者优势，但仍继承了SL的可扩展性、性能和安全性问题。

Method: SSFL通过将SL服务器的工作负载和通信开销分布到多个并行分片中来提高可扩展性和性能。BSFL在SSFL基础上用基于区块链的架构替换集中式服务器，采用委员会驱动的共识机制增强公平性和安全性，并包含评估机制排除中毒或被篡改的模型更新。

Result: 实验评估显示，与基线SL和SFL方法相比，SSFL分别将性能和可扩展性提高了31.2%和85.2%。BSFL对数据中毒攻击的抵御能力提高了62.7%，同时在正常操作条件下保持优越性能。

Conclusion: BSFL是首个实现端到端去中心化SplitFed学习系统的区块链驱动框架，有效解决了SFL的可扩展性、性能和安全性挑战。

Abstract: Collaborative and distributed learning techniques, such as Federated Learning
(FL) and Split Learning (SL), hold significant promise for leveraging sensitive
data in privacy-critical domains. However, FL and SL suffer from key
limitations -- FL imposes substantial computational demands on clients, while
SL leads to prolonged training times. To overcome these challenges, SplitFed
Learning (SFL) was introduced as a hybrid approach that combines the strengths
of FL and SL. Despite its advantages, SFL inherits scalability, performance,
and security issues from SL. In this paper, we propose two novel frameworks:
Sharded SplitFed Learning (SSFL) and Blockchain-enabled SplitFed Learning
(BSFL). SSFL addresses the scalability and performance constraints of SFL by
distributing the workload and communication overhead of the SL server across
multiple parallel shards. Building upon SSFL, BSFL replaces the centralized
server with a blockchain-based architecture that employs a committee-driven
consensus mechanism to enhance fairness and security. BSFL incorporates an
evaluation mechanism to exclude poisoned or tampered model updates, thereby
mitigating data poisoning and model integrity attacks. Experimental evaluations
against baseline SL and SFL approaches show that SSFL improves performance and
scalability by 31.2% and 85.2%, respectively. Furthermore, BSFL increases
resilience to data poisoning attacks by 62.7% while maintaining superior
performance under normal operating conditions. To the best of our knowledge,
BSFL is the first blockchain-enabled framework to implement an end-to-end
decentralized SplitFed Learning system.

### [185] [LAPIS: A Performance Portable, High Productivity Compiler Framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25605)
*Brian Kelley,Sivasankaran Rajamanickam*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: LAPIS是一个基于MLIR的编译器，旨在解决编程模型在可移植性、性能和生产力三个维度上的平衡问题，以及计算科学与机器学习领域代码集成和框架扩展性的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前编程模型在可移植性、性能和生产力三个关键维度上存在不平衡，计算科学与机器学习框架之间缺乏有效集成，且现有框架对新架构的扩展性不足。

Method: 开发基于MLIR的LAPIS编译器，构建基于Kokkos生态系统原则的方言，自动降低稀疏和密集线性代数内核，并促进PyTorch与Kokkos代码的集成。

Result: LAPIS能够自动处理计算科学和AI用例中的稀疏和密集线性代数内核，在不同架构上展示出良好的可移植性，并支持框架向新架构的扩展。

Conclusion: LAPIS成功解决了编程模型在三个关键维度上的平衡问题，为计算科学与机器学习的融合提供了有效的编译器解决方案，并具备良好的扩展性。

Abstract: Portability, performance, and productivity are three critical dimensions for
evaluating a programming model or compiler infrastructure. Several modern
programming models for computational science focus on performance and
portability. On the other end, several machine learning focused programming
models focus on portability and productivity. A clear solution that is strong
in all three dimensions has yet to emerge. A second related problem arises when
use cases from computational science converge with machine learning. The
disparate popular frameworks of these fields require programmers to manually
integrate codes written in different frameworks. Finally, several programming
frameworks lack easy options for extensibility as any new computer architecture
change require complex changes to the programming models. We present LAPIS, an
MLIR-based compiler that addresses all three of these challenges. We
demonstrate that LAPIS can automatically lower sparse and dense linear algebra
kernels from computational science and artificial intelligence use cases. We
also show how LAPIS facilitates the integration of codes between PyTorch and
Kokkos. We compare kernel performance with the default MLIR implementations on
diverse architectures to demonstrate portability. By developing a dialect that
is built on the principles of the Kokkos ecosystem, LAPIS also allows
extensibility of the framework to new architectures.

### [186] [PAST: Pilot and Adaptive Orchestration for Timely and Resilient Service Delivery in Edge-Assisted UAV Networks under Spatio-Temporal Dynamics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25700)
*Houyi Qi,Minghui Liwang,Liqun Fu,Sai Zou,Xinlei Yi,Wei Ni,Huaiyu Dai*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: PAST框架通过整合PilotAO和AdaptAO两个机制，为无人机边缘网络提供稳定灵活的资源交易方案，解决了传统现货和期货交易的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统现货交易存在协商延迟和高能耗问题，而传统期货交易难以适应动态不确定的无人机边缘环境，需要一种既能保证稳定性又具备灵活性的资源交易方案。

Method: PAST框架包含两个互补机制：PilotAO（带超额预订的试点交易协议）进行风险感知的早期决策，建立长期互利协议；AdaptAO（带超额预订率更新的自适应交易协议）根据无人机移动性、供需变化和协议性能动态更新协议。

Result: 在真实数据集上的实验表明，PAST在决策开销、任务完成延迟、资源利用率和社会福利方面均优于基准方法。

Conclusion: PAST通过预测性规划和实时调整的结合，为提升低空任务性能提供了稳健且自适应的实践参考。

Abstract: Incentive-driven resource trading is essential for UAV applications with
intensive, time-sensitive computing demands. Traditional spot trading suffers
from negotiation delays and high energy costs, while conventional futures
trading struggles to adapt to the dynamic, uncertain UAV-edge environment. To
address these challenges, we propose PAST (pilot-and-adaptive stable trading),
a novel framework for edge-assisted UAV networks with spatio-temporal dynamism.
PAST integrates two complementary mechanisms: PilotAO (pilot trading agreements
with overbooking), a risk-aware, overbooking-enabled early-stage
decision-making module that establishes long-term, mutually beneficial
agreements and boosts resource utilization; and AdaptAO (adaptive trading
agreements with overbooking rate update), an intelligent adaptation module that
dynamically updates agreements and overbooking rates based on UAV mobility,
supply-demand variations, and agreement performance. Together, these mechanisms
enable both stability and flexibility, guaranteeing individual rationality,
strong stability, competitive equilibrium, and weak Pareto optimality.
Extensive experiments on real-world datasets show that PAST consistently
outperforms benchmark methods in decision-making overhead, task completion
latency, resource utilization, and social welfare. By combining predictive
planning with real-time adjustments, PAST offers a valuable reference on robust
and adaptive practice for improving low-altitude mission performance.

### [187] [Accelerating LLM Inference with Precomputed Query Storage](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25919)
*Jay H. Park,Youngju Cho,Choungsol Lee,Moonwook Oh,Euiseong Seo*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: StorInfer是一个存储辅助的LLM推理系统，通过预计算和存储可预测的查询-响应对来加速响应时间，在语义匹配时绕过GPU推理，显著降低延迟和计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大型语言模型在资源受限环境（如设备端或边缘部署）中推理延迟高的问题，通过存储预计算结果来优化性能。

Method: 使用LLM驱动的生成器自适应生成多样化和去重的查询，采用自适应查询掩码和自适应采样技术，将查询-响应对嵌入并索引到基于磁盘的向量数据库中。

Result: 生成了15万个独特的预计算对（占用830MB存储空间），实现了高达17.3%的延迟减少，且响应质量无损失。

Conclusion: 存储辅助推理在可预测查询分布场景中具有实用性和可扩展性，为高效、低延迟的LLM部署提供了有前景的方向。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) inference often suffers from high latency,
particularly in resource-constrained environments such as on-device or edge
deployments. To address this challenge, we present StorInfer, a novel
storage-assisted LLM inference system that accelerates response time by
precomputing and storing predictable query-response pairs offline. When a user
query semantically matches a precomputed query, StorInfer bypasses expensive
GPU inference and instantly returns the stored response, significantly reducing
latency and compute costs. To maximize coverage and effectiveness, StorInfer
employs an LLM-driven generator that adaptively produces diverse and
deduplicated queries based on a given knowledge base. This is achieved via two
techniques: adaptive query masking, which prevents regeneration of similar
queries, and adaptive sampling, which dynamically tunes generation parameters
to promote semantic diversity. The resulting query-response pairs are embedded
and indexed using a disk-backed vector database to enable fast,
similarity-based retrieval at runtime. Using this approach, we generated 150K
unique precomputed pairs (taking up to 830 MB of storage space), achieving up
to 17.3% latency reduction with no loss in response quality. Our evaluation
across multiple QA datasets demonstrates the practicality and scalability of
storage-assisted inference, especially in scenarios with predictable query
distributions. StorInfer highlights a promising direction in leveraging storage
as a primary enabler for efficient, low-latency LLM deployment.

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: 本文扩展了开源NIC实现Corundum的功能，通过硬件实现时间感知流量管理，控制不同流量类别的带宽分配。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代网络接口卡(NIC)和FPGA已从简单设备发展为复杂异构系统，能够卸载主机CPU的复杂任务。作者旨在利用现代FPGA实现智能NIC，并通过硬件级流量管理来精确控制不同优先级队列的带宽分配。

Method: 扩展Corundum开源NIC实现，在AXI总线上暴露专用控制寄存器，使NIC驱动能够配置不同优先级队列的传输带宽。每个控制寄存器对应特定传输队列，设置其在传输窗口内获得输出端口访问权限的时间比例。通过Linux QDISC机制将队列与不同流量类别关联。

Result: 实验评估表明，该方法能够有效管理不同传输流预留的带宽，实现精确的带宽控制。

Conclusion: 通过硬件实现的时间感知流量管理机制，成功扩展了Corundum NIC的功能，为不同流量类别提供了精确的带宽控制能力，证明了现代FPGA在实现智能NIC方面的有效性。

Abstract: Network Interface Cards (NICs) greatly evolved from simple basic devices
moving traffic in and out of the network to complex heterogeneous systems
offloading host CPUs from performing complex tasks on in-transit packets. These
latter comprise different types of devices, ranging from NICs accelerating
fixed specific functions (e.g., on-the-fly data compression/decompression,
checksum computation, data encryption, etc.) to complex Systems-on-Chip (SoC)
equipped with both general purpose processors and specialized engines
(Smart-NICs). Similarly, Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) moved from pure
reprogrammable devices to modern heterogeneous systems comprising
general-purpose processors, real-time cores and even AI-oriented engines.
Furthermore, the availability of high-speed network interfaces (e.g., SFPs)
makes modern FPGAs a good choice for implementing Smart-NICs. In this work, we
extended the functionalities offered by an open-source NIC implementation
(Corundum) by enabling time-aware traffic management in hardware, and using
this feature to control the bandwidth associated with different traffic
classes. By exposing dedicated control registers on the AXI bus, the driver of
the NIC can easily configure the transmission bandwidth of different
prioritized queues. Basically, each control register is associated with a
specific transmission queue (Corundum can expose up to thousands of
transmission and receiving queues), and sets up the fraction of time in a
transmission window which the queue is supposed to get access the output port
and transmit the packets. Queues are then prioritized and associated to
different traffic classes through the Linux QDISC mechanism. Experimental
evaluation demonstrates that the approach allows to properly manage the
bandwidth reserved to the different transmission flows.

*Kuan-Wei Lu,Ding-Yong Hong,Pangfeng Liu,Jan-Jan Wu*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合双批次大小学习和循环渐进学习的混合分布式训练方法，在保持训练效率的同时提升模型泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前分布式机器学习主要依赖增加硬件资源和计算单元来加速训练，但使用大批次训练会导致泛化能力下降和准确率降低的问题。

Method: 基于参数服务器框架的双批次大小学习方案，同时使用硬件支持的最大批次和较小批次来增强泛化；结合循环渐进学习方案，从低到高逐步调整图像分辨率来提升训练速度。

Result: 在CIFAR-100上，相比传统方法准确率提升3.3%，训练时间减少10.6%；在ImageNet上准确率提升0.1%，训练时间减少35.7%。

Conclusion: 该混合方法能有效提升模型泛化能力和训练效率，解决了大批次训练导致的泛化问题。

Abstract: Distributed machine learning is critical for training deep learning models on
large datasets and with numerous parameters. Current research primarily focuses
on leveraging additional hardware resources and powerful computing units to
accelerate the training process. As a result, larger batch sizes are often
employed to speed up training. However, training with large batch sizes can
lead to lower accuracy due to poor generalization. To address this issue, we
propose the dual batch size learning scheme, a distributed training method
built on the parameter server framework. This approach maximizes training
efficiency by utilizing the largest batch size that the hardware can support
while incorporating a smaller batch size to enhance model generalization. By
using two different batch sizes simultaneously, this method reduces testing
loss and enhances generalization, with minimal extra training time.
Additionally, to mitigate the time overhead caused by dual batch size learning,
we propose the cyclic progressive learning scheme. This technique gradually
adjusts image resolution from low to high during training, significantly
boosting training speed. By combining cyclic progressive learning with dual
batch size learning, our hybrid approach improves both model generalization and
training efficiency. Experimental results using ResNet-18 show that, compared
to conventional training methods, our method can improve accuracy by 3.3% while
reducing training time by 10.6% on CIFAR-100, and improve accuracy by 0.1%
while reducing training time by 35.7% on ImageNet.

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: Parallax是一个去中心化的LLM服务系统，通过两阶段调度器将异构GPU池转化为高效推理平台，解决了集中式服务的成本问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 集中式LLM推理服务依赖专用GPU集群和高带宽互连，成本高昂。利用去中心化GPU池是更具吸引力的替代方案，但GPU异构性、有限网络带宽和动态可用性使得高效调度成为核心挑战。

Method: 采用两阶段调度器：1) 模型分配阶段，将每个副本的层分配到不同GPU上，在内存和链路带宽约束下联合优化延迟和吞吐量；2) 请求时GPU流水线选择阶段，将不同副本的层拼接成端到端执行链，平衡负载并适应当前条件。

Result: 在真实志愿者节点上部署开源LLM进行评估，Parallax相比去中心化基线方法持续降低延迟并提高吞吐量。

Conclusion: 原则性调度可以使志愿者计算成为LLM推理的实用且经济实惠的基础设施。

Abstract: Deploying a large language model (LLM) inference service remains costly
because centralized serving depends on specialized GPU clusters and
high-bandwidth interconnects in datacenters. An appealing alternative is to
leverage collaborative decentralized GPU pools. However, heterogeneity in GPU
and limited interconnected network bandwidth, along with potentially dynamic
availability, make efficient scheduling the central challenge in this scenario.
In this paper, we present Parallax, a decentralized LLM serving system that
turns a pool of heterogeneous GPUs into an efficient inference platform via a
two-phase scheduler. Parallax decomposes planning into (i) model allocation,
which places layers of each replica across diverse GPUs to jointly optimize
latency and throughput under memory and link-bandwidth constraints, and (ii)
request-time GPU pipeline selection, which stitches layers from different
replicas into end-to-end execution chains that balance load and adapt to
current conditions. We implement Parallax and evaluate it on open-source LLMs
deployed over real volunteer nodes. Parallax consistently reduces latency and
increases throughput relative to decentralized baselines, demonstrating that
principled scheduling can make volunteer compute a practical, affordable
substrate for LLM inference.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新算法，通过移动计算而非数据来显著减少脑模拟中的通信开销，将连接性更新时间减少6倍，尖峰交换时间减少两个数量级。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 脑模拟面临计算挑战：1011个神经元和1014个突触的高计算需求，突触更新依赖RMA和神经元间全对全通信阻碍了可扩展性。

Method: 使用Barnes-Hut近似降低计算复杂度从O(n²)到O(n log n)，并提出新算法通过移动计算而非数据来减少通信开销。

Result: 新算法使连接性更新时间减少6倍，尖峰交换时间减少超过两个数量级。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提高了脑模拟的可扩展性，为理解大脑功能和结构可塑性提供了更高效的计算工具。

Abstract: The detailed functioning of the human brain is still poorly understood. Brain
simulations are a well-established way to complement experimental research, but
must contend with the computational demands of the approximately $10^{11}$
neurons and the $10^{14}$ synapses connecting them, the network of the latter
referred to as the connectome. Studies suggest that changes in the connectome
(i.e., the formation and deletion of synapses, also known as structural
plasticity) are essential for critical tasks such as memory formation and
learning. The connectivity update can be efficiently computed using a
Barnes-Hut-inspired approximation that lowers the computational complexity from
$O(n^2)$ to $O(n log n)$, where n is the number of neurons. However, updating
synapses, which relies heavily on RMA, and the spike exchange between neurons,
which requires all-to-all communication at every time step, still hinder
scalability. We present a new algorithm that significantly reduces the
communication overhead by moving computation instead of data. This shrinks the
time it takes to update connectivity by a factor of six and the time it takes
to exchange spikes by more than two orders of magnitude.

### [192] [CSnake: Detecting Self-Sustaining Cascading Failure via Causal Stitching of Fault Propagations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26529)
*Shangshu Qian,Lin Tan,Yongle Zhang*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: CSnake是一个故障注入框架，通过因果拼接技术模拟复杂的故障传播链，用于检测分布式系统中的自维持级联故障。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有故障检测技术难以在部署前暴露自维持级联故障，因为这些故障需要特定条件的复杂组合才能触发，涉及多个故障传播序列。

Method: 采用因果拼接思想，将不同测试中的单故障注入因果连接；设计故障因果分析(FCA)识别故障传播链；使用三阶段测试预算分配协议和本地兼容性检查来优化搜索。

Result: 在五个系统中检测到15个导致自维持级联故障的bug，其中5个已确认，2个已修复。

Conclusion: CSnake框架能有效暴露分布式系统中的自维持级联故障，通过因果拼接和优化搜索策略解决了复杂故障传播的检测挑战。

Abstract: Recent studies have revealed that self-sustaining cascading failures in
distributed systems frequently lead to widespread outages, which are
challenging to contain and recover from. Existing failure detection techniques
struggle to expose such failures prior to deployment, as they typically require
a complex combination of specific conditions to be triggered. This challenge
stems from the inherent nature of cascading failures, as they typically involve
a sequence of fault propagations, each activated by distinct conditions.
  This paper presents CSnake, a fault injection framework to expose
self-sustaining cascading failures in distributed systems. CSnake uses the
novel idea of causal stitching, which causally links multiple single-fault
injections in different tests to simulate complex fault propagation chains. To
identify these chains, CSnake designs a counterfactual causality analysis of
fault propagations - fault causality analysis (FCA): FCA compares the execution
trace of a fault injection run with its corresponding profile run (i.e., same
test w/o the injection) and identifies any additional faults triggered, which
are considered to have a causal relationship with the injected fault.
  To address the large search space of fault and workload combinations, CSnake
employs a three-phase allocation protocol of test budget that prioritizes
faults with unique and diverse causal consequences, increasing the likelihood
of uncovering conditional fault propagations. Furthermore, to avoid incorrectly
connecting fault propagations from workloads with incompatible conditions,
CSnake performs a local compatibility check that approximately checks the
compatibility of the path constraints associated with connected fault
propagations with low overhead.
  CSnake detected 15 bugs that cause self-sustaining cascading failures in five
systems, five of which have been confirmed with two fixed.

algorithm is validated on a single-core Cora Z7, demonstrating its feasibility
for real time, resource-constrained embedded applications.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) is a transformative technique with profound
implications on novel view synthesis and real-time rendering. Given its
importance, there have been many attempts to improve its performance. However,
with the increasing complexity of GPU architectures and the vast search space
of performance-tuning parameters, it is a challenging task. Although manual
optimizations have achieved remarkable speedups, they require domain expertise
and the optimization process can be highly time consuming and error prone. In
this paper, we propose to exploit large language models (LLMs) to analyze and
optimize Gaussian splatting kernels. To our knowledge, this is the first work
to use LLMs to optimize highly specialized real-world GPU kernels. We reveal
the intricacies of using LLMs for code optimization and analyze the code
optimization techniques from the LLMs. We also propose ways to collaborate with
LLMs to further leverage their capabilities. For the original 3DGS code on the
MipNeRF360 datasets, LLMs achieve significant speedups, 19% with Deepseek and
24% with GPT-5, demonstrating the different capabilities of different LLMs. By
feeding additional information from performance profilers, the performance
improvement from LLM-optimized code is enhanced to up to 42% and 38% on
average. In comparison, our best-effort manually optimized version can achieve
a performance improvement up to 48% and 39% on average, showing that there are
still optimizations beyond the capabilities of current LLMs. On the other hand,
even upon a newly proposed 3DGS framework with algorithmic optimizations,
Seele, LLMs can still further enhance its performance by 6%, showing that there
are optimization opportunities missed by domain experts. This highlights the
potential of collaboration between domain experts and LLMs.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) inference requires substantial computational
resources, yet CPU-based inference remains essential for democratizing AI due
to the widespread availability of CPUs compared to specialized accelerators.
However, efficient LLM inference on CPUs faces two fundamental challenges: (1)
existing CPU architectures struggle with low-precision arithmetic required by
quantized models, where optimal bit precision varies across models and layers;
and (2) the memory-bound nature of the token generation phase creates severe
performance bottlenecks. To address these challenges, we propose SAIL
(SRAM-Accelerated Inference of LLMs), a CPU-based inference solution that
efficiently supports arbitrary bit precisions with minimal overhead. SAIL
integrates three key innovations: First, we introduce Batched LUT-based General
Matrix-Vector Multiplication (LUT-GEMV) with SRAM-based processing-in-memory,
enabling high data reuse through lookup tables and reducing memory movement.
Second, our Pattern-Aware LUT optimization identifies and exploits redundancy
in input activation patterns, reducing computation cycles by 13.8\%. Third, we
develop an in-memory type conversion algorithm that leverages PIM's parallelism
for efficient de-/quantization operations, alleviating pressure on CPU's vector
units. Our architecture requires only 2\% hardware overhead and a single new
instruction, while maintaining dual functionality as both compute and storage
units. Experimental evaluations using a modified gem5 simulator demonstrate
that SAIL achieves up to 10.7x speedup and 19.9x higher tokens per dollar
compared to ARM Neoverse-N1 CPU baselines, and up to 7.04x better cost
efficiency than NVIDIA V100 GPUs, establishing a practical path for efficient
CPU-based LLM inference.

Abstract: Energy efficiency is one of the major concern in designing advanced computing
infrastructures. From single nodes to large-scale systems (data centers),
monitoring the energy consumption of the computing system when applications run
is a critical task. Designers and application developers often rely on software
tools and detailed architectural models to extract meaningful information and
determine the system energy consumption. However, when a design space
exploration is required, designers may incur in continuous tuning of the models
to match with the system under evaluation. To overcome such limitations, we
propose a holistic approach to monitor energy consumption at runtime without
the need of running complex (micro-)architectural models. Our approach is based
on a measurement board coupled with a FPGA-based System-on-Module. The
measuring board captures currents and voltages (up to tens measuring points)
driving the FPGA and exposes such values through a specific memory region. A
running service reads and computes energy consumption statistics without
consuming extra resources on the FPGA device. Our approach is also scalable to
monitoring of multi-nodes infrastructures (clusters). We aim to leverage this
framework to perform experiments in the context of an aeronautical design
application; specifically, we will look at optimizing performance and energy
consumption of a shallow artificial neural network on RISC-V based soft-cores.
