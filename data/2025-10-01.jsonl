We first benchmarked 8 LLMs on six\nbasic circuits and selected three high-performing models to optimize a\n20-transistor CMOS operational amplifier, targeting multiple performance\nmetrics, including rail-to-rail operation from 180 nm to 90 nm technology\nnodes. Notably, OpenAI o3 successfully achieved the user-intended target at 90\nnm across three different test groups, with a maximum of 20 iterations,\ndemonstrating adaptability and robustness at advanced nodes. To assess design\nrobustness, we manually designed a bias circuit and performed a variation\nanalysis using Gaussian-distributed variations on transistor dimensions and\nthreshold voltages."}

First, we create expert models with\nfunctional diversity yet parameter similarity by fine-tuning a domain-agnostic\nbase model on individual temporal domains while constraining weight changes.\nSecond, we optimize the bias-variance tradeoff through adaptive averaging\ncoefficients derived from modeling temporal weight trajectories in a principal\ncomponent subspace.

We provide empirical and\ntheoretical evidence showing these methods often fail precisely due to this\noverlooked relationship. For random forget sets, this dependence means that\ndegrading forget set metrics (which, for a retrained model, should mirror test\nset metrics) inevitably harms overall test performance. Going beyond random\nsets, we consider logistic regression as an instructive example where a\ncritical failure mode emerges: inter-set dependence causes gradient\ndescent-ascent iterations to progressively diverge from the ideal retrained\nmodel. Strikingly, these methods can converge to solutions that are not only\nfar from the retrained ideal but are potentially even further from it than the\noriginal model itself, rendering the unlearning process actively detrimental.
