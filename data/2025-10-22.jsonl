In existing systems, core attention is colocated with\nother layers; at long context lengths, its quadratic compute growth compared to\nthe near-linear growth of other components causes load imbalance and stragglers\nacross data and pipeline parallel groups. CAD is enabled by two observations.\nFirst, core attention is stateless: it has no trainable parameters and only\nminimal transient data, so balancing reduces to scheduling compute-bound tasks.\nSecond, it is composable: modern attention kernels retain high efficiency when\nprocessing fused batches of token-level shards with arbitrary lengths. CAD\npartitions core attention into token-level tasks and dispatches them to\ndedicated attention servers, which dynamically rebatch tasks to equalize\ncompute without sacrificing kernel efficiency. We implement CAD in a system\ncalled DistCA, which uses a ping-pong execution scheme to fully overlap\ncommunication with computation and in-place execution on attention servers to\nreduce memory use. On 512 H200 GPUs and context lengths up to 512k tokens,\nDistCA improves end-to-end training throughput by up to 1.35x, eliminates data\nand pipeline parallel stragglers, and achieves near-perfect compute and memory\nbalance."}

The improvement arises from stochastic difference\nlatent updates in TM, which preserve target covariance that deterministic FM\nunderestimates. We then characterize convergence rates, showing that TM\nachieves faster convergence than FM under a fixed compute budget, establishing\nits advantage in the unimodal Gaussian setting.

Although balancing the\nconvergence speeds of different tasks is an effective approach to address this\nissue, it is highly challenging to accurately characterize the training\ndynamics and convergence speeds of multiple tasks within the complex MTL\nsystem. To this end, we attempt to analyze the training dynamics in MTL by\nleveraging Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) theory and propose a new MTL method,\nNTKMTL. Specifically, we introduce an extended NTK matrix for MTL and adopt\nspectral analysis to balance the convergence speeds of multiple tasks, thereby\nmitigating task imbalance.

By concentrating conservatism in uncertain and costly regions\nwhile preserving sharp gradients in safe areas, USC enables policies to achieve\neffective reward-safety trade-offs. Extensive experiments show that USC reduces\nsafety violations by approximately 40% while maintaining competitive or higher\nrewards, and reduces the error between predicted and true cost gradients by\napproximately 83%, breaking the prevailing trade-off between safety and\nperformance and paving the way for scalable safe RL."}

In this work, we propose\nOmniCast, a scalable and skillful probabilistic model that unifies weather\nforecasting across timescales. OmniCast consists of two components: a VAE model\nthat encodes raw weather data into a continuous, lower-dimensional latent\nspace, and a diffusion-based transformer model that generates a sequence of\nfuture latent tokens given the initial conditioning tokens.

This makes synthetic data a potentially valuable\nasset that enables these medical analyses, along with the development of new\ninference methods themselves. Generative models can produce synthetic data that\nclosely approximate real data distributions, yet existing methods do not\nconsider the unique challenges that downstream causal inference tasks, and\nspecifically those focused on treatments, pose. We establish a set of\ndesiderata that synthetic data containing treatments should satisfy to maximise\ndownstream utility: preservation of (i) the covariate distribution, (ii) the\ntreatment assignment mechanism, and (iii) the outcome generation mechanism.\nBased on these desiderata, we propose a set of evaluation metrics to assess\nsuch synthetic data. Finally, we present STEAM: a novel method for generating\nSynthetic data for Treatment Effect Analysis in Medicine that mimics the\ndata-generating process of data containing treatments and optimises for our\ndesiderata. We empirically demonstrate that STEAM achieves state-of-the-art\nperformance across our metrics as compared to existing generative models,\nparticularly as the complexity of the true data-generating process increases."}
