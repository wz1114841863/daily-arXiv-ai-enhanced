Many practical applications of LLMs, such as code completion and\nstructured data extraction, require adherence to syntactic constraints\nspecified by a formal language.

In this paper we address\nthis challenge and present the first constrained decoding method for diffusion\nmodels, one that can handle formal languages captured by context-free grammars.\nWe begin by reducing constrained decoding to the more general additive\ninfilling problem, which asks whether a partial output can be completed to a\nvalid word in the target language.

Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have\nmade it possible to generate code from natural language, opening new\nopportunities for automating parametric 3D modeling. However, directly\ntranslating human design intent into executable CAD code remains highly\nchallenging, due to the need for logical reasoning, syntactic correctness, and\nnumerical precision. In this work, we propose CAD-RL, a multimodal\nChain-of-Thought (CoT) guided reinforcement learning post training framework\nfor CAD modeling code generation. Our method combines CoT-based Cold Start with\ngoal-driven reinforcement learning post training using three task-specific\nrewards: executability reward, geometric accuracy reward, and external\nevaluation reward. To ensure stable policy learning under sparse and\nhigh-variance reward conditions, we introduce three targeted optimization\nstrategies: Trust Region Stretch for improved exploration, Precision Token Loss\nfor enhanced dimensions parameter accuracy, and Overlong Filtering to reduce\nnoisy supervision. To support training and benchmarking, we release ExeCAD, a\nnoval dataset comprising 16,540 real-world CAD examples with paired natural\nlanguage and structured design language descriptions, executable CADQuery\nscripts, and rendered 3D models. Experiments demonstrate that CAD-RL achieves\nsignificant improvements in reasoning quality, output precision, and code\nexecutability over existing VLMs."}

In\nstandard ReFT frameworks, a behavior model generates multiple completions with\nanswers per problem, for the answer to be then scored by a reward function.\nWhile such RL post-training methods demonstrate significant performance\nimprovements across challenging reasoning domains, the computational cost of\ngenerating completions during training with multiple inference steps makes the\ntraining cost non-trivial. To address this, we draw inspiration from off-policy\nRL, and speculative decoding to introduce a novel ReFT framework, dubbed\nNested-ReFT, where a subset of layers of the target model acts as the behavior\nmodel to generate off-policy completions during training. The behavior model\nconfigured with dynamic layer skipping per batch during training decreases the\ninference cost compared to the standard ReFT frameworks.

With large\nfoundation models (FMs) demonstrating impressive capabilities, using FMs in FL\nthrough cost-efficient adapter tuning has become a popular approach. Given the\nrapidly evolving healthcare environment, it is crucial for individual clients\nto quickly adapt to new tasks or diseases by tuning adapters while drawing upon\npast experiences. In this work, we introduce Federated Knowledge-Enhanced\nInitialization (FedKEI), a novel framework that leverages cross-client and\ncross-task transfer from past knowledge to generate informed initializations\nfor learning new tasks with adapters. FedKEI begins with a global clustering\nprocess at the server to generalize knowledge across tasks, followed by the\noptimization of aggregation weights across clusters (inter-cluster weights) and\nwithin each cluster (intra-cluster weights) to personalize knowledge transfer\nfor each new task. To facilitate more effective learning of the inter- and\nintra-cluster weights, we adopt a bi-level optimization scheme that\ncollaboratively learns the global intra-cluster weights across clients and\noptimizes the local inter-cluster weights toward each client's task objective.\nExtensive experiments on three benchmark datasets of different modalities,\nincluding dermatology, chest X-rays, and retinal OCT, demonstrate FedKEI's\nadvantage in adapting to new diseases compared to state-of-the-art methods."}

Existing defenses, including host\nbased patching and network based filtering, are inadequate due to limited\nscalability across diverse devices, compatibility issues especially with\nembedded or legacy systems, and error prone deployment process (manual patch\nvalidation). To address these issues, we introduce REFN (Reinforcement Learning\nFrom Network), a novel framework that trains Large Language Models (LLMs) to\nautonomously generate network filters to prevent 1 day or n day exploitations.\nREFN ensures scalability by uniquely employs Reinforcement Learning (RL) driven\nby online network rewards instead of traditional Human Feedback (RLHF). REFN\nguarantees compatibility via unified deployment on edge security gateways\n(Amazon Eero). REFN provides robustness via online validation using real\nnetwork traffic. Crucially, REFN addresses three core challenges in training\nLLMs for exploit prevention: 1) expanding current LLMs limited vulnerability\nfixing expertise via Agentic RAG based Knowledge Distillation, 2) bridging\ncurrent LLMs language to network gaps through an RL From VNF Pipeline that\ntranslates language context (vulnerability description) into network\nenforcement, 3) addressing the LLM hallucination and non determinism via the\nOnline Agentic Validation that penalizes erroneous outputs. Evaluated across 22\nfamilies of 1 day or n day exploits, REFN demonstrates effectiveness (21.1\npercent higher accuracy than alternatives), efficiency (Mean Time To Patch of\n3.65 hours) and scalability (easily scale to 10K devices). REFN serves as an\ninitial step toward training LLMs to rapidly prevent massive scale 1 day or n\nday exploitations."}
