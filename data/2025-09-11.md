### [1] [Qubit-Efficient QUBO Formulation for Constrained Optimization Problems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08080)
*Meerzhan Kantbekova,Vincenzo De Maio,Ivona Brandic*

Main category: cs.ET

TL;DR: 量子计算中组合优化问题的QUBO编码需要大量占用量子位，本文提出一种基于指数减伤函数的编码方法，可显著减少量子位需求但保持解的质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 量子处理器(QPU)中的量子位数量有限，而现有的QUBO编码方法需要大量额外变量来编码不等式约束，导致量子位需求过高，无法在NISQ设备上扩展。

Method: 提出一种广义的指数减伤框架，通过一类指数函数来编码QUBO中的不等式约束。对比分析了多种指数函数的理论性质和实践表现，扩展了之前的特定指数函数方法。

Result: 实验结果显示，在数据包装问题(BPP)和旅行商问题(TSP)上，指数减伤方法分别减少83%和57%的量子位需求。在8位量子位的BPP和12位量子位的TSP上，分别达到6%和21%的准确率，解质量可与经典方法相比。

Conclusion: 指数减伤框架为量子组合优化问题提供了一种高效的编码方法，显著减少了量子位需求，同时保持了解的质量，适用于量子资源有限的NISQ设备。

Abstract: Quantum computing has emerged as a promising alternative for solving
combinatorial optimization problems. The standard approach for encoding
optimization problems on quantum processing units (QPUs) involves transforming
them into their Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO)
representation. However, encoding constraints of optimization problems,
particularly inequality constraints, into QUBO requires additional variables,
which results in more qubits. Considering the limited availability of qubits in
NISQ machines, existing encoding methods fail to scale due to their reliance on
large numbers of qubits. We propose a generalized exponential penalty framework
for QUBO inequality constraints inspired by a class of exponential functions,
which we call exponential penalization. This paper presents an encoding
strategy for inequality constraints in combinatorial optimization problems,
inspired by a class of exponential functions, which we call exponential
penalization. The initial idea of using exponential penalties for QUBO
formulation was introduced by Montanez-Barrera et al. by applying a specific
exponential function to reduce qubit requirements. In this work, we extend that
approach by conducting a comprehensive study on a broader class of exponential
functions, analyzing their theoretical properties and empirical performance.
Our experimental results demonstrate that an exponential penalization achieves
57%, 83% qubit number reduction for Bin Packing Problem (BPP) and Traveling
Salesman Problem (TSP), respectively. And we demonstrate comparable solution
quality to classical with a probability of 6% and 21% accuracy for BPP with 8
and TSP with 12 qubits, respectively.

### [2] [Rotatable Array-Aided Hybrid Beamforming for Integrated Sensing and Communication](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08652)
*Zequan Wang,Liang Yin,Yitong Liu,Yunan Sun,Hongwen Yang*

Main category: cs.ET

TL;DR: 本文研究了基于三维可旋转天线架构的多用户ISAC系统子连接混合波束成形设计，提出了一种基于交替优化框架的算法，通过处理五个子问题来优化系统性能，相比传统固定位置天线能显著提升系统整体性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 集成传感与通信(ISAC)是下一代无线通信网络的关键支撑技术，但在非理想信道特性影响下，如何通过波束成形技术在非理想信道中平衡系统性能和硬件成本控制成为亟待解决的关键问题。

Method: 针对RA架构下考虑有效孔径损耗的信道模型，使用分数规划框架转换复杂分式目标函数，提出基于交替优化架构的算法，通过交替求解五个子问题实现优化，其中利用KKT条件推导阵列旋转角的闭式更新表达式，并提出基于两阶段梯度上升的天线旋转角优化方法。

Result: 仿真结果表明，与传统固定位置天线相比，所提方法能显著提升系统的整体性能。

Conclusion: 基于三维可旋转天线的混合波束成形设计能有效改善ISAC系统的通信和感知性能，在非理想信道条件下实现了系统性能与硬件复杂度的良好平衡。

Abstract: Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC) is one of the pivotal supporting
technologies for next-generation wireless communication networks. As an
emerging technical means, the new six-dimensional movable antenna (6DMA) system
can effectively improve the communication and sensing performance of ISAC
systems. However, related research on the architecture based on
three-dimensional rotatable antennas (RA) remains relatively limited.
Especially under the influence of non-ideal channel characteristics, how to
balance system performance and hardware cost control through beamforming
technology in non-ideal channels has become a crucial issue to be solved
urgently. Given the significant advantages of hybrid beamforming technology in
balancing system performance and hardware complexity, this paper focuses on the
channel model considering effective aperture loss under the RA architecture and
studies the sub-connected hybrid beamforming design for multi-user ISAC
systems. Aiming at the non-convex nature with coupled variables in this
problem, this paper first transforms the complex fractional objective function
using the Fractional Programming (FP) framework, and then proposes an algorithm
based on the Alternating Optimization (AO) architecture, which achieves
optimization by alternately solving five subproblems. Among them, the
closed-form update expression of the array rotation angle is derived through
the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions, and a two-stage Gradient Ascent (GA)
based method is proposed to optimize the antenna rotation angle. Simulation
results show that compared with the traditional fixed-position antenna (FPA),
the proposed method can significantly improve the overall performance of the
system.

### [3] [Revisiting Deepfake Detection: Chronological Continual Learning and the Limits of Generalization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07993)
*Federico Fontana,Anxhelo Diko,Romeo Lanzino,Marco Raoul Marini,Bachir Kaddar,Gian Luca Foresti,Luigi Cinque*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文将深度伪造检测重构为持续学习问题，提出了一种高效框架，能够增量适应新兴视觉操控技术同时保留历史知识，运行速度比全重新训练快155倍，但对未来生成器的泛化能力仍接近随机水平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度伪造生成技术的快速发展给检测系统带来了极大挑战，非持续学习方法需要频繁且费用昂贵的重新训练。需要一种能够持续适应新技术的检测方框。

Method: 提出了一种高效的持续学习框架，基于轻量级视觉背榜网络，模拟了7年内深度伪造技术的真实时间序列进化。同时提出了两个新的评估指标：持续AUC（C-AUC）和前向转积AUC（FWT-AUC）。

Result: 经过涉及600个模拟的广泛实验，证明该框架能够实现高效适应（比全重新训练快155倍）和稳固的历史知识保留。但对未来生成器的泛化能力仍接近随机水平（FWT-AUC≈0.5），这是因为每个生成器都有其独特的特征印记。

Conclusion: 研究提出了非通用深度伪造分布假设fuff0c说明当前方法在没有额外训练的情况下对未来生成器的泛化能力有限。这为深度伪造检测领域的持续学习研究提供了重要见解和方向。

Abstract: The rapid evolution of deepfake generation technologies poses critical
challenges for detection systems, as non-continual learning methods demand
frequent and expensive retraining. We reframe deepfake detection (DFD) as a
Continual Learning (CL) problem, proposing an efficient framework that
incrementally adapts to emerging visual manipulation techniques while retaining
knowledge of past generators. Our framework, unlike prior approaches that rely
on unreal simulation sequences, simulates the real-world chronological
evolution of deepfake technologies in extended periods across 7 years.
Simultaneously, our framework builds upon lightweight visual backbones to allow
for the real-time performance of DFD systems. Additionally, we contribute two
novel metrics: Continual AUC (C-AUC) for historical performance and Forward
Transfer AUC (FWT-AUC) for future generalization. Through extensive
experimentation (over 600 simulations), we empirically demonstrate that while
efficient adaptation (+155 times faster than full retraining) and robust
retention of historical knowledge is possible, the generalization of current
approaches to future generators without additional training remains near-random
(FWT-AUC $\approx$ 0.5) due to the unique imprint characterizing each existing
generator. Such observations are the foundation of our newly proposed
Non-Universal Deepfake Distribution Hypothesis.
  \textbf{Code will be released upon acceptance.}

### [4] [How Far Are We from True Unlearnability?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08058)
*Kai Ye,Liangcai Su,Chenxiong Qian*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文研究现有的不可学习方法在多任务场景下的限制，通过损失几何角度分析发现参数优化路径差异，提出了Sharpness-Aware Learnability (SAL)和Unlearnable Distance (UD)来量化数据的不可学习性，并对主流方法进行了评测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然现有的不可学习方法能够生成不可学习示例(UEs)，但在多任务数据集Taskonomy上，这些UEs在语义分割等任务中仍然有效，这与预期的跨任务不可学习性相违。研究者想要了解真正实现不可学习示例还有多远。

Method: 从模型优化角度出发，观察清洁模型和毒化模型的收敛过程差异。通过损失几何分析发现只有部分关键参数优化路径存在显著差异。基于此提出了Sharpness-Aware Learnability (SAL)来量化参数的不可学习性，以及Unlearnable Distance (UD)来测量数据的不可学习性。

Result: 研究发现现有的不可学习方法在跨任务场景下存在限制，UEs并不能完全阻止模型在不同任务上的学习。通过损失几何分析发现了参数优化路径的差异与不可学习性的关联性。SAL和UD提供了量化评估的方法。

Conclusion: 本文通过模型优化角度探索了不可学习示例的本质，提出了基于损失几何的量化指标SAL和UD。对主流不可学习方法的评测显示了它们的能力边界，期待能够提高社区对现有方法限制的认识。

Abstract: High-quality data plays an indispensable role in the era of large models, but
the use of unauthorized data for model training greatly damages the interests
of data owners. To overcome this threat, several unlearnable methods have been
proposed, which generate unlearnable examples (UEs) by compromising the
training availability of data. Clearly, due to unknown training purposes and
the powerful representation learning capabilities of existing models, these
data are expected to be unlearnable for models across multiple tasks, i.e.,
they will not help improve the model's performance. However, unexpectedly, we
find that on the multi-task dataset Taskonomy, UEs still perform well in tasks
such as semantic segmentation, failing to exhibit cross-task unlearnability.
This phenomenon leads us to question: How far are we from attaining truly
unlearnable examples? We attempt to answer this question from the perspective
of model optimization. To this end, we observe the difference in the
convergence process between clean and poisoned models using a simple model
architecture. Subsequently, from the loss landscape we find that only a part of
the critical parameter optimization paths show significant differences,
implying a close relationship between the loss landscape and unlearnability.
Consequently, we employ the loss landscape to explain the underlying reasons
for UEs and propose Sharpness-Aware Learnability (SAL) to quantify the
unlearnability of parameters based on this explanation. Furthermore, we propose
an Unlearnable Distance (UD) to measure the unlearnability of data based on the
SAL distribution of parameters in clean and poisoned models. Finally, we
conduct benchmark tests on mainstream unlearnable methods using the proposed
UD, aiming to promote community awareness of the capability boundaries of
existing unlearnable methods.

### [5] [Interpretability as Alignment: Making Internal Understanding a Design Principle](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08592)
*Aadit Sengupta,Pratinav Seth,Vinay Kumar Sankarapu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文主张将可解释性特别是机制性方法作为对齐的核心设计原则，而非辅助诊断工具，认为这是实现AI安全可信的关键


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型神经模型在高风险场景部署时存在与人类价值观对齐的可靠性问题，需要内部透明度来确保系统行为符合人类意图

Method: 提倡机制性可解释性方法（如电路追踪、激活修补）而非事后解释方法（如LIME、SHAP），前者能提供因果洞察并识别行为方法可能忽略的内部故障

Result: 机制性可解释性方法能够揭示包括欺骗性或未对齐推理在内的内部故障，为AI对齐提供更可靠的途径

Conclusion: AI安全和可信度的进展取决于将可解释性作为AI研发的一等目标，确保系统不仅有效而且可审计、透明且与人类意图对齐

Abstract: Large neural models are increasingly deployed in high-stakes settings,
raising concerns about whether their behavior reliably aligns with human
values. Interpretability provides a route to internal transparency by revealing
the computations that drive outputs. We argue that interpretability especially
mechanistic approaches should be treated as a design principle for alignment,
not an auxiliary diagnostic tool. Post-hoc methods such as LIME or SHAP offer
intuitive but correlational explanations, while mechanistic techniques like
circuit tracing or activation patching yield causal insight into internal
failures, including deceptive or misaligned reasoning that behavioral methods
like RLHF, red teaming, or Constitutional AI may overlook. Despite these
advantages, interpretability faces challenges of scalability, epistemic
uncertainty, and mismatches between learned representations and human concepts.
Our position is that progress on safe and trustworthy AI will depend on making
interpretability a first-class objective of AI research and development,
ensuring that systems are not only effective but also auditable, transparent,
and aligned with human intent.

TL;DR: JEL是一个新颖的计算高效端到端多神经网络实体链接模型，在性能上超越了当前最先进模型，特别适用于新闻分析等金融应用场景。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 知识图谱在整合多源异构数据和捕捉实体关系方面具有重要价值，但如何正确地将文本中的提及链接到知识图谱中的数千个实体是一个核心挑战。实体链接在自然语言处理中至关重要，特别是在摩根大通的新闻分析平台中，每年有超过200万美元的外部供应商成本，需要高效的实体链接解决方案。

Conclusion: 实体链接对于桥接非结构化新闻文本和知识图谱至关重要，JEL模型为新闻分析等金融应用提供了高效的解决方案，能够显著提升用户工作效率。

Abstract: We present JEL, a novel computationally efficient end-to-end multi-neural
network based entity linking model, which beats current state-of-art model.
Knowledge Graphs have emerged as a compelling abstraction for capturing
critical relationships among the entities of interest and integrating data from
multiple heterogeneous sources. A core problem in leveraging a knowledge graph
is linking its entities to the mentions (e.g., people, company names) that are
encountered in textual sources (e.g., news, blogs., etc) correctly, since there
are thousands of entities to consider for each mention. This task of linking
mentions and entities is referred as Entity Linking (EL). It is a fundamental
task in natural language processing and is beneficial in various uses cases,
such as building a New Analytics platform. News Analytics, in JPMorgan, is an
essential task that benefits multiple groups across the firm. According to a
survey conducted by the Innovation Digital team 1 , around 25 teams across the
firm are actively looking for news analytics solutions, and more than \$2
million is being spent annually on external vendor costs. Entity linking is
critical for bridging unstructured news text with knowledge graphs, enabling
users access to vast amounts of curated data in a knowledge graph and
dramatically facilitating their daily work.

Conclusion: 医疗领域生成式AI评估需要超越传统量化基准，采用更全面的评估策略以确保模型在实际临床环境中的可靠性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) represent an emerging paradigm
within artificial intelligence, with applications throughout the medical
enterprise. Assessing GenAI applications necessitates a comprehensive
understanding of the clinical task and awareness of the variability in
performance when implemented in actual clinical environments. Presently, a
prevalent method for evaluating the performance of generative models relies on
quantitative benchmarks. Such benchmarks have limitations and may suffer from
train-to-the-test overfitting, optimizing performance for a specified test set
at the cost of generalizability across other task and data distributions.
Evaluation strategies leveraging human expertise and utilizing cost-effective
computational models as evaluators are gaining interest. We discuss current
state-of-the-art methodologies for assessing the performance of GenAI
applications in healthcare and medical devices.

### [8] [Hammer and Anvil: A Principled Defense Against Backdoors in Federated Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08089)
*Lucas Fenaux,Zheng Wang,Jacob Yan,Nathan Chung,Florian Kerschbaum*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种新的适应性攻击者模型和一种名为Hammer and Anvil的防御方法，通过结合两种不同原理的防御技术，有效抵御联邦学习中的后门攻击。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦学习分布式设置容易受到恶意客户端的后门攻击，而现有防御方法在面对适应性攻击者时效果不佳，需要更有效的防御策略。

Method: 首先设计了一种新的适应性攻击者模型，然后提出Hammer and Anvil防御方法，将两种基础原理不同的防御技术结合起来，具体包括kKrum+防御算法。

Result: 新的适应性攻击者只需要1-2个恶意客户端就能突破现有防御，而Krum+防御方法能够有效抵御新攻击者和现有的先进攻击。

Conclusion: 通过结合不同原理的防御技术，可以构建更加健壮的联邦学习安全防御体系，有效应对适应性攻击者的挑战。

Abstract: Federated Learning is a distributed learning technique in which multiple
clients cooperate to train a machine learning model. Distributed settings
facilitate backdoor attacks by malicious clients, who can embed malicious
behaviors into the model during their participation in the training process.
These malicious behaviors are activated during inference by a specific trigger.
No defense against backdoor attacks has stood the test of time, especially
against adaptive attackers, a powerful but not fully explored category of
attackers. In this work, we first devise a new adaptive adversary that
surpasses existing adversaries in capabilities, yielding attacks that only
require one or two malicious clients out of 20 to break existing
state-of-the-art defenses. Then, we present Hammer and Anvil, a principled
defense approach that combines two defenses orthogonal in their underlying
principle to produce a combined defense that, given the right set of
parameters, must succeed against any attack. We show that our best combined
defense, Krum+, is successful against our new adaptive adversary and
state-of-the-art attacks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PhysioCLR是一个生理学感知的对比学习框架，通过整合ECG生理学相似性线索和特定增强技术，提升心电图心律失常分类的泛化能力和临床相关性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于AI的心电图分析受限于标注数据不足，自监督学习可以利用大规模未标注数据，但现有方法缺乏对ECG生理学特性的考虑。

Method: 提出PhysioCLR框架：1）在预训练中学习临床相关特征的相似样本嵌入；2）整合ECG生理相似性线索到对比学习；3）引入ECG特定增强技术；4）使用混合损失函数优化表示质量。

Result: 在Chapman、Georgia两个公共数据集和私有ICU数据集上测试，PhysioCLR相比最强基线平均AUROC提升12%，展现出强大的跨数据集泛化能力。

Conclusion: 通过将生理学知识嵌入对比学习，PhysioCLR能够学习具有临床意义且可迁移的ECG特征，为更有效和标签高效的心电图诊断提供了有前景的路径。

Abstract: Objective: Electrocardiograms (ECGs) play a crucial role in diagnosing heart
conditions; however, the effectiveness of artificial intelligence (AI)-based
ECG analysis is often hindered by the limited availability of labeled data.
Self-supervised learning (SSL) can address this by leveraging large-scale
unlabeled data. We introduce PhysioCLR (Physiology-aware Contrastive Learning
Representation for ECG), a physiology-aware contrastive learning framework that
incorporates domain-specific priors to enhance the generalizability and
clinical relevance of ECG-based arrhythmia classification. Methods: During
pretraining, PhysioCLR learns to bring together embeddings of samples that
share similar clinically relevant features while pushing apart those that are
dissimilar. Unlike existing methods, our method integrates ECG physiological
similarity cues into contrastive learning, promoting the learning of clinically
meaningful representations. Additionally, we introduce ECG- specific
augmentations that preserve the ECG category post augmentation and propose a
hybrid loss function to further refine the quality of learned representations.
Results: We evaluate PhysioCLR on two public ECG datasets, Chapman and Georgia,
for multilabel ECG diagnoses, as well as a private ICU dataset labeled for
binary classification. Across the Chapman, Georgia, and private cohorts,
PhysioCLR boosts the mean AUROC by 12% relative to the strongest baseline,
underscoring its robust cross-dataset generalization. Conclusion: By embedding
physiological knowledge into contrastive learning, PhysioCLR enables the model
to learn clinically meaningful and transferable ECG eatures. Significance:
PhysioCLR demonstrates the potential of physiology-informed SSL to offer a
promising path toward more effective and label-efficient ECG diagnostics.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is a novel, multidisciplinary Machine Learning
paradigm where multiple clients, such as mobile devices, collaborate to solve
machine learning problems. Initially introduced in Kone{\v{c}}n{\'y} et al.
(2016a,b); McMahan et al. (2017), FL has gained further attention through its
inclusion in the National AI Research and Development Strategic Plan (2023
Update) of the United States (Science and on Artificial Intelligence, 2023).
The FL training process is inherently decentralized and often takes place in
less controlled settings compared to data centers, posing unique challenges
distinct from those in fully controlled environments. In this thesis, we
identify five key challenges in Federated Learning and propose novel approaches
to address them. These challenges arise from the heterogeneity of data and
devices, communication issues, and privacy concerns for clients in FL training.
Moreover, even well-established theoretical advances in FL require diverse
forms of practical implementation to enhance their real-world applicability.
Our contributions advance FL algorithms and systems, bridging theoretical
advancements and practical implementations. More broadly, our work serves as a
guide for researchers navigating the complexities of translating theoretical
methods into efficient real-world implementations and software. Additionally,
it offers insights into the reverse process of adapting practical
implementation aspects back into theoretical algorithm design. This reverse
process is particularly intriguing, as the practical perspective compels us to
examine the underlying mechanics and flexibilities of algorithms more deeply,
often uncovering new dimensions of the algorithms under study.

*Kishan Padayachy,Ronald Richman,Salvatore Scognamiglio,Mario V. Wüthrich*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于Credibility Transformer的新范式，通过添加上下文学习机制来增强模型性能，能够处理训练时未见过的分类特征水平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩展经典Transformer架构，通过可信度机制和上下文学习来提高模型学习和预测性能，特别是在处理新出现的分类特征时。

Method: 在Credibility Transformer基础上增加上下文学习机制，使用包含相似实例的上下文批次来增强CLS令牌表示，通过额外信息进行微调。

Result: 实证验证表明上下文学习通过适应相似风险模式提高了预测准确性，并且能够泛化到训练时未见过的分类特征水平的新实例。

Conclusion: 所提出的上下文学习范式有效提升了Credibility Transformer的性能，使其能够处理训练数据中未出现过的新类别特征，具有很好的泛化能力。

Abstract: The starting point of our network architecture is the Credibility Transformer
which extends the classical Transformer architecture by a credibility mechanism
to improve model learning and predictive performance. This Credibility
Transformer learns credibilitized CLS tokens that serve as learned
representations of the original input features. In this paper we present a new
paradigm that augments this architecture by an in-context learning mechanism,
i.e., we increase the information set by a context batch consisting of similar
instances. This allows the model to enhance the CLS token representations of
the instances by additional in-context information and fine-tuning. We
empirically verify that this in-context learning enhances predictive accuracy
by adapting to similar risk patterns. Moreover, this in-context learning also
allows the model to generalize to new instances which, e.g., have feature
levels in the categorical covariates that have not been present when the model
was trained -- for a relevant example, think of a new vehicle model which has
just been developed by a car manufacturer.

### [12] [Sketched Gaussian Mechanism for Private Federated Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08195)
*Qiaobo Li,Zhijie Chen,Arindam Banerjee*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了Sketched Gaussian Mechanism (SGM)，将梯度压缩和差分隐私机制结合，通过联合分析提供更灵活和更强的隐私保护，在相同噪声预算下比传统高斯机制提供更强的隐私保证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦学习中通信成本和隐私保护是两个主要挑战。现有研究孤立分析梯度压缩和高斯机制的隐私效果，未能充分利用两者的协同效应。

Method: 提出SGM机制，直接结合梯度压缩（sketching）和高斯机制（Gaussian mechanism），使用Rényi-DP工具进行联合隐私分析，证明隐私级别与压缩维度b的平方根成反比。

Result: 理论证明SGM在固定噪声量下隐私保护强度与1/√b成正比，实验显示在相同隐私级别下，基于SGM的联邦学习性能至少与非压缩私有FL变体相当，在某些设置中表现更优。

Conclusion: SGM机制通过联合分析压缩和隐私机制，在保持通信效率的同时提供更强的隐私保护，服务器端使用自适应优化器可进一步提升性能而不影响隐私保证。

Abstract: Communication cost and privacy are two major considerations in federated
learning (FL). For communication cost, gradient compression by sketching the
clients' transmitted model updates is often used for reducing per-round
communication. For privacy, the Gaussian mechanism (GM), which consists of
clipping updates and adding Gaussian noise, is commonly used to guarantee
client-level differential privacy. Existing literature on private FL analyzes
privacy of sketching and GM in an isolated manner, illustrating that sketching
provides privacy determined by the sketching dimension and that GM has to
supply any additional desired privacy.
  In this paper, we introduce the Sketched Gaussian Mechanism (SGM), which
directly combines sketching and the Gaussian mechanism for privacy. Using
R\'enyi-DP tools, we present a joint analysis of SGM's overall privacy
guarantee, which is significantly more flexible and sharper compared to
isolated analysis of sketching and GM privacy. In particular, we prove that the
privacy level of SGM for a fixed noise magnitude is proportional to
$1/\sqrt{b}$, where $b$ is the sketching dimension, indicating that (for
moderate $b$) SGM can provide much stronger privacy guarantees than the
original GM under the same noise budget. We demonstrate the application of SGM
to FL with either gradient descent or adaptive server optimizers, and establish
theoretical results on optimization convergence, which exhibits only a
logarithmic dependence on the number of parameters $d$. Experimental results
confirm that at the same privacy level, SGM based FL is at least competitive
with non-sketching private FL variants and outperforms them in some settings.
Moreover, using adaptive optimization at the server improves empirical
performance while maintaining the privacy guarantees.

Conclusion: 该工作为模型异构联邦学习领域提供了第一个系统化的评估平台，有助于理解各种算法在实际边缘环境下的表现和适用性。

Abstract: Federating heterogeneous models on edge devices with diverse resource
constraints has been a notable trend in recent years. Compared to traditional
federated learning (FL) that assumes an identical model architecture to
cooperate, model-heterogeneous FL is more practical and flexible since the
model can be customized to satisfy the deployment requirement. Unfortunately,
no prior work ever dives into the existing model-heterogeneous FL algorithms
under the practical edge device constraints and provides quantitative analysis
on various data scenarios and metrics, which motivates us to rethink and
re-evaluate this paradigm. In our work, we construct the first system platform
\textbf{PracMHBench} to evaluate model-heterogeneous FL on practical
constraints of edge devices, where diverse model heterogeneity algorithms are
classified and tested on multiple data tasks and metrics. Based on the
platform, we perform extensive experiments on these algorithms under the
different edge constraints to observe their applicability and the corresponding
heterogeneity pattern.

Abstract: This paper presents a framework for predicting rare, high-impact outcomes by
integrating large language models (LLMs) with a multi-model machine learning
(ML) architecture. The approach combines the predictive strength of black-box
models with the interpretability required for reliable decision-making. We use
LLM-powered feature engineering to extract and synthesize complex signals from
unstructured data, which are then processed within a layered ensemble of models
including XGBoost, Random Forest, and Linear Regression. The ensemble first
produces a continuous estimate of success likelihood, which is then thresholded
to produce a binary rare-event prediction. We apply this framework to the
domain of Venture Capital (VC), where investors must evaluate startups with
limited and noisy early-stage data. The empirical results show strong
performance: the model achieves precision between 9.8X and 11.1X the random
classifier baseline in three independent test subsets. Feature sensitivity
analysis further reveals interpretable success drivers: the startup's category
list accounts for 15.6% of predictive influence, followed by the number of
founders, while education level and domain expertise contribute smaller yet
consistent effects.

Conclusion: mmm-fair独特地结合了深度多属性公平性、多目标优化、无代码聊天界面、LLM驱动的解释、交互式帕累托探索和可部署模型，是现有公平性工具中罕见的组合。

Abstract: Fairness-aware classification requires balancing performance and fairness,
often intensified by intersectional biases. Conflicting fairness definitions
further complicate the task, making it difficult to identify universally fair
solutions. Despite growing regulatory and societal demands for equitable AI,
popular toolkits offer limited support for exploring multi-dimensional fairness
and related trade-offs. To address this, we present mmm-fair, an open-source
toolkit leveraging boosting-based ensemble approaches that dynamically
optimizes model weights to jointly minimize classification errors and diverse
fairness violations, enabling flexible multi-objective optimization. The system
empowers users to deploy models that align with their context-specific needs
while reliably uncovering intersectional biases often missed by
state-of-the-art methods. In a nutshell, mmm-fair uniquely combines in-depth
multi-attribute fairness, multi-objective optimization, a no-code, chat-based
interface, LLM-powered explanations, interactive Pareto exploration for model
selection, custom fairness constraint definition, and deployment-ready models
in a single open-source toolkit, a combination rarely found in existing
fairness tools. Demo walkthrough available at: https://youtu.be/_rcpjlXFqkw.

Conclusion: 该框架为回归任务中的多属性公平性问题提供了有效解决方案，特别适用于连续属性和多属性同时存在的情况，具有实际应用价值

Abstract: Ensuring equitable treatment (fairness) across protected attributes (such as
gender or ethnicity) is a critical issue in machine learning. Most existing
literature focuses on binary classification, but achieving fairness in
regression tasks-such as insurance pricing or hiring score assessments-is
equally important. Moreover, anti-discrimination laws also apply to continuous
attributes, such as age, for which many existing methods are not applicable. In
practice, multiple protected attributes can exist simultaneously; however,
methods targeting fairness across several attributes often overlook so-called
"fairness gerrymandering", thereby ignoring disparities among intersectional
subgroups (e.g., African-American women or Hispanic men). In this paper, we
propose a distance covariance regularisation framework that mitigates the
association between model predictions and protected attributes, in line with
the fairness definition of demographic parity, and that captures both linear
and nonlinear dependencies. To enhance applicability in the presence of
multiple protected attributes, we extend our framework by incorporating two
multivariate dependence measures based on distance covariance: the previously
proposed joint distance covariance (JdCov) and our novel concatenated distance
covariance (CCdCov), which effectively address fairness gerrymandering in both
regression and classification tasks involving protected attributes of various
types. We discuss and illustrate how to calibrate regularisation strength,
including a method based on Jensen-Shannon divergence, which quantifies
dissimilarities in prediction distributions across groups. We apply our
framework to the COMPAS recidivism dataset and a large motor insurance claims
dataset.

Result: 在多个合成和真实数据集上的实验表明，MARLINE比几种最先进的数据流学习方法更准确

Conclusion: MARLINE方法能够有效处理概念漂移问题，在源域和目标域概念不匹配的情况下仍能充分利用多源知识，提升预测性能

Abstract: Concept drift is a major problem in online learning due to its impact on the
predictive performance of data stream mining systems. Recent studies have
started exploring data streams from different sources as a strategy to tackle
concept drift in a given target domain. These approaches make the assumption
that at least one of the source models represents a concept similar to the
target concept, which may not hold in many real-world scenarios. In this paper,
we propose a novel approach called Multi-source mApping with tRansfer LearnIng
for Non-stationary Environments (MARLINE). MARLINE can benefit from knowledge
from multiple data sources in non-stationary environments even when source and
target concepts do not match. This is achieved by projecting the target concept
to the space of each source concept, enabling multiple source sub-classifiers
to contribute towards the prediction of the target concept as part of an
ensemble. Experiments on several synthetic and real-world datasets show that
MARLINE was more accurate than several state-of-the-art data stream learning
approaches.

Conclusion: 提出的两种迁移学习方法有效解决了多标签数据流中的概念漂移问题，通过标签间知识迁移显著提升了多标签分类在非平稳环境中的性能

Abstract: Label concepts in multi-label data streams often experience drift in
non-stationary environments, either independently or in relation to other
labels. Transferring knowledge between related labels can accelerate
adaptation, yet research on multi-label transfer learning for data streams
remains limited. To address this, we propose two novel transfer learning
methods: BR-MARLENE leverages knowledge from different labels in both source
and target streams for multi-label classification; BRPW-MARLENE builds on this
by explicitly modelling and transferring pairwise label dependencies to enhance
learning performance. Comprehensive experiments show that both methods
outperform state-of-the-art multi-label stream approaches in non-stationary
environments, demonstrating the effectiveness of inter-label knowledge transfer
for improved predictive performance.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个新颖框架，展示Transformer如何动态处理因果结构，发现了选择性归纳头机制，使模型能够根据上下文选择正确的因果结构进行预测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究使用固定因果结构的马尔可夫链来研究归纳头的形成，但无法捕捉自然语言中动态变化的token关系。需要探索Transformer在变化因果结构下的能力。

Method: 通过交错具有不同滞后但固定转移概率的马尔可夫链来变化因果结构，构建3层Transformer实现选择性归纳头，并进行理论分析。

Result: Transformer学会了选择性归纳头机制，能够通过识别正确的滞后并从过去复制相应token来预测下一个token，该机制渐近收敛于最大似然解。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了Transformer选择因果结构的能力，为理解其功能和可解释性提供了新见解，推进了对Transformer工作机制的理解。

Abstract: Transformers have exhibited exceptional capabilities in sequence modeling
tasks, leveraging self-attention and in-context learning. Critical to this
success are induction heads, attention circuits that enable copying tokens
based on their previous occurrences. In this work, we introduce a novel
framework that showcases transformers' ability to dynamically handle causal
structures. Existing works rely on Markov Chains to study the formation of
induction heads, revealing how transformers capture causal dependencies and
learn transition probabilities in-context. However, they rely on a fixed causal
structure that fails to capture the complexity of natural languages, where the
relationship between tokens dynamically changes with context. To this end, our
framework varies the causal structure through interleaved Markov chains with
different lags while keeping the transition probabilities fixed. This setting
unveils the formation of Selective Induction Heads, a new circuit that endows
transformers with the ability to select the correct causal structure
in-context. We empirically demonstrate that transformers learn this mechanism
to predict the next token by identifying the correct lag and copying the
corresponding token from the past. We provide a detailed construction of a
3-layer transformer to implement the selective induction head, and a
theoretical analysis proving that this mechanism asymptotically converges to
the maximum likelihood solution. Our findings advance the understanding of how
transformers select causal structures, providing new insights into their
functioning and interpretability.

TL;DR: 这篇论文研究使用生成对抗网络(WGAN-GP)咄渡散模型来生成真实的头盘电流(EEG)巧合艺术段落，用于数据增帆和压力测试。在TUH EEG巧合艺术数据集上，WGAN-GP在频谱对齐方面表现更好，但两种模型的类别条件恢复能力都较弱。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: EEG中的各种巧合艺术(肌肉、眼球运动、电极、咬喂、发抖等)影响自动化分析的准确性，但大规模标注成本高。研究使用现代生成模型来合成真实的、带标签的巧合艺术数据段落，以支持数据增帆和压力测试。

Method: 使用TUH EEG巧合艺术(TUAR)数据集，进行主体分割和固定长度多通道窗口处理。比较条件WGAN-GP(带抗损失和投影判别器)与1D去噪渡散模型(带分类器免指导)。通过三个维度评估：(i)保真度(Welch频带功率差异、通道协方差范数、自相关L2距离、分布指标MMD/PRD)；(ii)特异性(类别条件恢复)；(iii)实用性(数据增帆效果)。

Result: WGAN-GP模型在频谱对齐方面表现更好，与真实数据的MMD距离更小。但两种模型都显示出较弱的类别条件恢复能力，这限制了立即的数据增帆效果。

Conclusion: 研究为EEG巧合艺术合成建立了可复现的基准线，并持发了数据清单、训练配置和评估脚本。虽然WGAN-GP在保真度方面表现更优，但两种模型在条件控制方面都有攻养空间，需要更强的条件控制机制咄更好的覆盖能力。

Abstract: Artifacts in electroencephalography (EEG) -- muscle, eye movement, electrode,
chewing, and shiver -- confound automated analysis yet are costly to label at
scale. We study whether modern generative models can synthesize realistic,
label-aware artifact segments suitable for augmentation and stress-testing.
Using the TUH EEG Artifact (TUAR) corpus, we curate subject-wise splits and
fixed-length multi-channel windows (e.g., 250 samples) with preprocessing
tailored to each model (per-window min-max for adversarial training;
per-recording/channel $z$-score for diffusion). We compare a conditional
WGAN-GP with a projection discriminator to a 1D denoising diffusion model with
classifier-free guidance, and evaluate along three axes: (i) fidelity via Welch
band-power deltas ($\Delta\delta,\ \Delta\theta,\ \Delta\alpha,\ \Delta\beta$),
channel-covariance Frobenius distance, autocorrelation $L_2$, and
distributional metrics (MMD/PRD); (ii) specificity via class-conditional
recovery with lightweight $k$NN/classifiers; and (iii) utility via augmentation
effects on artifact recognition. In our setting, WGAN-GP achieves closer
spectral alignment and lower MMD to real data, while both models exhibit weak
class-conditional recovery, limiting immediate augmentation gains and revealing
opportunities for stronger conditioning and coverage. We release a reproducible
pipeline -- data manifests, training configurations, and evaluation scripts --
to establish a baseline for EEG artifact synthesis and to surface actionable
failure modes for future work.

Motivation: 解决降维模型(ROMs)在长时间范围内预测能力下降的问题，提高对复杂偏微分方程的高效数值汇正能力

Method: 采用灵活的高阶有限差分方案，并提出Rollout损失函数来训练ROMs在任意时间范围内做准确预测

Result: 在2D Burgers方程上验证了方法的有效性，显著提升了长时间预测的准确性

Conclusion: 该方法为降维模型提供了一种有效的方案，能够在保持计算效率的同时改善长时间范围内对偏微分方程的预测性能

Abstract: Solving complex partial differential equations is vital in the physical
sciences, but often requires computationally expensive numerical methods.
Reduced-order models (ROMs) address this by exploiting dimensionality reduction
to create fast approximations. While modern ROMs can solve parameterized
families of PDEs, their predictive power degrades over long time horizons. We
address this by (1) introducing a flexible, high-order, yet inexpensive
finite-difference scheme and (2) proposing a Rollout loss that trains ROMs to
make accurate predictions over arbitrary time horizons. We demonstrate our
approach on the 2D Burgers equation.

Conclusion: PS框架提供了一种完全数据驱动的策略选择方法，能够有效处理上下文随机优化中的策略异构性问题，并在不同场景下表现出优越性能

Abstract: We address the problem of policy selection in contextual stochastic
optimization (CSO), where covariates are available as contextual information
and decisions must satisfy hard feasibility constraints. In many CSO settings,
multiple candidate policies--arising from different modeling paradigms--exhibit
heterogeneous performance across the covariate space, with no single policy
uniformly dominating. We propose Prescribe-then-Select (PS), a modular
framework that first constructs a library of feasible candidate policies and
then learns a meta-policy to select the best policy for the observed
covariates. We implement the meta-policy using ensembles of Optimal Policy
Trees trained via cross-validation on the training set, making policy choice
entirely data-driven. Across two benchmark CSO problems--single-stage
newsvendor and two-stage shipment planning--PS consistently outperforms the
best single policy in heterogeneous regimes of the covariate space and
converges to the dominant policy when such heterogeneity is absent. All the

Abstract: Human Activity Recognition (HAR) has seen significant advancements with the
adoption of deep learning techniques, yet challenges remain in terms of data
requirements, reliability and robustness. This paper explores a novel
application of Ensemble Distribution Distillation (EDD) within a
self-supervised learning framework for HAR aimed at overcoming these
challenges. By leveraging unlabeled data and a partially supervised training
strategy, our approach yields an increase in predictive accuracy, robust
estimates of uncertainty, and substantial increases in robustness against
adversarial perturbation; thereby significantly improving reliability in
real-world scenarios without increasing computational complexity at inference.
We demonstrate this with an evaluation on several publicly available datasets.
The contributions of this work include the development of a self-supervised EDD
framework, an innovative data augmentation technique designed for HAR, and
empirical validation of the proposed method's effectiveness in increasing
robustness and reliability.

Abstract: Distributed and federated learning are essential paradigms for training
models across decentralized data sources while preserving privacy, yet
communication overhead remains a major bottleneck. This dissertation explores
strategies to improve communication efficiency, focusing on model compression,
local training, and personalization. We establish a unified framework for
biased and unbiased compression operators with convergence guarantees, then
propose adaptive local training strategies that incorporate personalization to
accelerate convergence and mitigate client drift. In particular, Scafflix
balances global and personalized objectives, achieving superior performance
under both IID and non-IID settings. We further introduce privacy-preserving
pruning frameworks that optimize sparsity while minimizing communication costs,
with Cohort-Squeeze leveraging hierarchical aggregation to reduce cross-device
overhead. Finally, SymWanda, a symmetric post-training pruning method, enhances
robustness under high sparsity and maintains accuracy without retraining.
Extensive experiments on benchmarks and large-scale language models demonstrate
favorable trade-offs among accuracy, convergence, and communication, offering
theoretical and practical insights for scalable, efficient distributed
learning.

Conclusion: CRISP工具包平等化了大规模多中心重症监护数据的访问，使得研究人员能够专注于临床AI算法的发展，而非数据预处理的技术挑战。

Abstract: While existing critical care EHR datasets such as MIMIC and eICU have enabled
significant advances in clinical AI research, the CRITICAL dataset opens new
frontiers by providing extensive scale and diversity -- containing 1.95 billion
records from 371,365 patients across four geographically diverse CTSA
institutions. CRITICAL's unique strength lies in capturing full-spectrum
patient journeys, including pre-ICU, ICU, and post-ICU encounters across both
inpatient and outpatient settings. This multi-institutional, longitudinal
perspective creates transformative opportunities for developing generalizable
predictive models and advancing health equity research. However, the richness
of this multi-site resource introduces substantial complexity in data
harmonization, with heterogeneous collection practices and diverse vocabulary
usage patterns requiring sophisticated preprocessing approaches.
  We present CRISP to unlock the full potential of this valuable resource.
CRISP systematically transforms raw Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership
Common Data Model data into ML-ready datasets through: (1) transparent data
quality management with comprehensive audit trails, (2) cross-vocabulary
mapping of heterogeneous medical terminologies to unified SNOMED-CT standards,
with deduplication and unit standardization, (3) modular architecture with
parallel optimization enabling complete dataset processing in $<$1 day even on
standard computing hardware, and (4) comprehensive baseline model benchmarks
spanning multiple clinical prediction tasks to establish reproducible
performance standards. By providing processing pipeline, baseline
implementations, and detailed transformation documentation, CRISP saves
researchers months of preprocessing effort and democratizes access to
large-scale multi-institutional critical care data, enabling them to focus on
advancing clinical AI.

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive
capabilities in various downstream tasks but typically face Catastrophic
Forgetting (CF) during fine-tuning. In this paper, we propose the
Forgetting-Aware Pruning Metric (FAPM), a novel pruning-based approach to
balance CF and downstream task performance. Our investigation reveals that the
degree to which task vectors (i.e., the subtraction of pre-trained weights from
the weights fine-tuned on downstream tasks) overlap with pre-trained model
parameters is a critical factor for CF. Based on this finding, FAPM employs the
ratio of the task vector to pre-trained model parameters as a metric to
quantify CF, integrating this measure into the pruning criteria. Importantly,
FAPM does not necessitate modifications to the training process or model
architecture, nor does it require any auxiliary data. We conducted extensive
experiments across eight datasets, covering natural language inference, General
Q&A, Medical Q&A, Math Q&A, reading comprehension, and cloze tests. The results
demonstrate that FAPM limits CF to just 0.25\% while maintaining 99.67\%
accuracy on downstream tasks. We provide the code to reproduce our results.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着视觉-语言模型的发展，对其推理能力的监督日益增强。虽然它们在许多任务上表现优异，但对基础科学原理（如物理）的理解仍是个未充分探索的领域。

Method: 设计了一个新颖且易用的框架，包含一个实用的场景生成器，创建了超过400个问题的多样化测试床，涵盖四个核心领域：抛体运动、碰撞动力学、力学和流体动力学。对四个最先进的VLM进行了全面评估。

Abstract: As Vision-Language Models (VLMs) grow in sophistication, their ability to
perform reasoning is coming under increasing supervision. While they excel at
many tasks, their grasp of fundamental scientific principles, such as physics,
remains an underexplored frontier. To reflect the advancements in these
capabilities, we introduce a novel and accessible framework designed to
rigorously evaluate VLMs on their understanding of 2D physics. Our framework
features a pragmatic scenario generator that creates a diverse testbed of over
400 problems across four core domains: Projectile Motion, Collision Dynamics,
Mechanics, and Fluid Dynamics. Through comprehensive evaluation of four
state-of-the-art VLMs, we demonstrate a strong correlation between model scale
and reasoning ability, with our top-performing model, Qwen2.5-VL-7B, achieving
an overall score of 0.815. We find that while models excel at formulaic
problems, they struggle significantly with domains requiring abstract spatial
reasoning. By designing this framework, we aim to democratize the study of
scientific reasoning in VLMs and foster deeper insights into their capabilities
and limitations.

Method: 提出MPWE方法，通过矩阵赋形技术动态捕捉多个地理模型预测间的协变依赖关系，并采用重复感知权重分配来平衡各模型的贡献。

Result: 在越南八大河流域的5个预报时间段(1小时及12、24、48、72、84小时累积降雨)上，MPWE均实现了更低的预测误差均值和标准差，显示出更高的准确性和稳定性。

Conclusion: MPWE方法能够有效提升多地理模型集成预报的性能，在复杂气候条件下为降雨预报提供了更准确和可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Rainfall forecasting in Vietnam is highly challenging due to its diverse
climatic conditions and strong geographical variability across river basins,
yet accurate and reliable forecasts are vital for flood management, hydropower
operation, and disaster preparedness. In this work, we propose a Matrix
Profile-based Weighted Ensemble (MPWE), a regime-switching framework that
dynamically captures covariant dependencies among multiple geographical model
forecasts while incorporating redundancy-aware weighting to balance
contributions across models. We evaluate MPWE using rainfall forecasts from
eight major basins in Vietnam, spanning five forecast horizons (1 hour and
accumulated rainfall over 12, 24, 48, 72, and 84 hours). Experimental results
show that MPWE consistently achieves lower mean and standard deviation of
prediction errors compared to geographical models and ensemble baselines,
demonstrating both improved accuracy and stability across basins and horizons.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习自动调制识别模型需要大量标注数据，但在新模型开发或超参数调优时，重复使用海量数据进行训练的时间和能耗成本过高。

Method: FoQuS记录完整数据集训练过程中每个样本的预测轨迹，基于训练动态构建三个重要性指标来筛选核集。

Result: 实验表明FoQuS在多个AMR数据集上仅使用1%-30%原始数据就能保持高识别精度和良好的跨架构泛化能力。

Conclusion: FoQuS有效解决了AMR模型开发中的训练效率问题，通过智能数据选择大幅降低计算开销而不牺牲性能。

Abstract: Deep learning-based Automatic Modulation Recognition (AMR) model has made
significant progress with the support of large-scale labeled data. However,
when developing new models or performing hyperparameter tuning, the time and
energy consumption associated with repeated training using massive amounts of
data are often unbearable. To address the above challenges, we propose
\emph{FoQuS}, which approximates the effect of full training by selecting a
coreset from the original dataset, thereby significantly reducing training
overhead. Specifically, \emph{FoQuS} records the prediction trajectory of each
sample during full-dataset training and constructs three importance metrics
based on training dynamics. Experiments show that \emph{FoQuS} can maintain
high recognition accuracy and good cross-architecture generalization on
multiple AMR datasets using only 1\%-30\% of the original data.

TL;DR: EvolKV是一个自适应的KV缓存压缩框架，通过进化搜索动态配置各层缓存预算，在保持任务性能的同时显著提升内存效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的KV缓存压缩方法通常依赖启发式策略，忽略了层间特征模式与任务性能的关键交互，导致泛化能力下降。

Method: 将缓存分配重新表述为多目标优化问题，利用进化搜索动态配置各层预算，直接最大化下游任务性能。

Result: 在11个任务上的实验表明，该方法在长上下文任务中优于所有基线方法，在GSM8K上比启发式基线高出7个百分点。仅使用1.5%原始预算就在代码补全任务上超越完整KV缓存性能。

Conclusion: EvolKV展示了学习型压缩策略在KV缓存预算分配中的巨大潜力，能够同时优化内存效率和任务性能。

Abstract: Existing key-value (KV) cache compression methods typically rely on
heuristics, such as uniform cache allocation across layers or static eviction
policies, however, they ignore the critical interplays among layer-specific
feature patterns and task performance, which can lead to degraded
generalization. In this paper, we propose EvolKV, an adaptive framework for
layer-wise, task-driven KV cache compression that jointly optimizes the memory
efficiency and task performance. By reformulating cache allocation as a
multi-objective optimization problem, EvolKV leverages evolutionary search to
dynamically configure layer budgets while directly maximizing downstream
performance. Extensive experiments on 11 tasks demonstrate that our approach
outperforms all baseline methods across a wide range of KV cache budgets on
long-context tasks and surpasses heuristic baselines by up to 7 percentage
points on GSM8K. Notably, EvolKV achieves superior performance over the full KV
cache setting on code completion while utilizing only 1.5% of the original
budget, suggesting the untapped potential in learned compression strategies for
KV cache budget allocation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 强化学习算法在复杂稀疏奖励环境中需要长时间训练，现有加速技术如奖励塑造和课程学习需要领域专业知识且过于特定。

Method: 采用学生-教师架构，使用LLM(Llama、Vicuna、DeepSeek)作为导师为RL算法(DQN、PPO、A2C)提供指导，并在Blackjack、Snake、Connect Four环境中进行54种配置实验，探索建议重用机制。

Result: LLM指导显著加速RL收敛，同时保持可比的最优性能。建议重用机制进一步缩短训练时间，但导致收敛动态不太稳定。效果对具体任务、RL算法和LLM模型组合敏感。

Conclusion: LLM辅导总体上改善了强化学习的收敛性能，其有效性取决于任务、算法和模型的特定组合，建议重用虽能加速但可能影响稳定性。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms often require long training to become
useful, especially in complex environments with sparse rewards. While
techniques like reward shaping and curriculum learning exist to accelerate
training, these are often extremely specific and require the developer's
professionalism and dedicated expertise in the problem's domain. Tackling this
challenge, in this study, we explore the effectiveness of pre-trained Large
Language Models (LLMs) as tutors in a student-teacher architecture with RL
algorithms, hypothesizing that LLM-generated guidance allows for faster
convergence. In particular, we explore the effectiveness of reusing the LLM's
advice on the RL's convergence dynamics. Through an extensive empirical
examination, which included 54 configurations, varying the RL algorithm (DQN,
PPO, A2C), LLM tutor (Llama, Vicuna, DeepSeek), and environment (Blackjack,
Snake, Connect Four), our results demonstrate that LLM tutoring significantly
accelerates RL convergence while maintaining comparable optimal performance.
Furthermore, the advice reuse mechanism shows a further improvement in training
duration but also results in less stable convergence dynamics. Our findings
suggest that LLM tutoring generally improves convergence, and its effectiveness
is sensitive to the specific task, RL algorithm, and LLM model combination.

TL;DR: MoEpic是一种高效的MoE推理系统，通过专家分割机制和预测预取策略，在减少GPU内存需求的同时显著提升推理速度


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MoE模型参数庞大，GPU内存需求高，专家缓存命中率低且加载延迟大，限制了MoE LLMs的广泛应用

Method: 提出专家垂直分割机制（top/bottom段），缓存热点专家的top段以提高缓存命中率；预测下一层激活专家并预取；基于定点迭代的自适应缓存配置算法

Result: 实验表明MoEpic可节省约一半GPU成本，推理延迟降低37.51%-65.73%

Conclusion: MoEpic通过创新的专家分割和智能缓存管理，有效解决了MoE推理中的内存和性能瓶颈问题

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) has emerged as a promising architecture for modern
large language models (LLMs). However, massive parameters impose heavy GPU
memory (i.e., VRAM) demands, hindering the widespread adoption of MoE LLMs.
Offloading the expert parameters to CPU RAM offers an effective way to
alleviate the VRAM requirements for MoE inference. Existing approaches
typically cache a small subset of experts in VRAM and dynamically prefetch
experts from RAM during inference, leading to significant degradation in
inference speed due to the poor cache hit rate and substantial expert loading
latency. In this work, we propose MoEpic, an efficient MoE inference system
with a novel expert split mechanism. Specifically, each expert is vertically
divided into two segments: top and bottom. MoEpic caches the top segment of hot
experts, so that more experts will be stored under the limited VRAM budget,
thereby improving the cache hit rate. During each layer's inference, MoEpic
predicts and prefetches the activated experts for the next layer. Since the top
segments of cached experts are exempt from fetching, the loading time is
reduced, which allows efficient transfer-computation overlap. Nevertheless, the
performance of MoEpic critically depends on the cache configuration (i.e., each
layer's VRAM budget and expert split ratio). To this end, we propose a
divide-and-conquer algorithm based on fixed-point iteration for adaptive cache
configuration. Extensive experiments on popular MoE LLMs demonstrate that
MoEpic can save about half of the GPU cost, while lowering the inference
latency by about 37.51%-65.73% compared to the baselines.

TL;DR: 通过在决策损失梯度中添加预测损失梯度扰动，提出了一种稳定的决策聚焦学习方法，解决了传统DFL训练不稳定的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统预测聚焦学习(PFL)和决策聚焦学习(DFL)分别存在优化稳定性和决策质量的偏重问题，DFL虽然直接优化决策质量但因损失函数形状而训练不稳定。

Method: 使用预测损失梯度扰动决策损失梯度来构造更新方向，采用Sigmoid衰减参数让预测损失梯度指导决策损失梯度进行训练。

Result: 在三个随机优化问题上进行实验，证明方法能够获得更低的后悔和更稳定的训练效果，甚至在PFL或DFL表现差的情况下也能发挥作用。

Conclusion: 该方法通过结合预测损失和决策损失的梯度信息，实现了稳定且高效的决策聚焦学习，并且无需额外训练或修改现有算法。

Abstract: Decision-making under uncertainty is often considered in two stages:
predicting the unknown parameters, and then optimizing decisions based on
predictions. While traditional prediction-focused learning (PFL) treats these
two stages separately, decision-focused learning (DFL) trains the predictive
model by directly optimizing the decision quality in an end-to-end manner.
However, despite using exact or well-approximated gradients, vanilla DFL often
suffers from unstable convergence due to its flat-and-sharp loss landscapes. In
contrast, PFL yields more stable optimization, but overlooks the downstream
decision quality. To address this, we propose a simple yet effective approach:
perturbing the decision loss gradient using the prediction loss gradient to
construct an update direction. Our method requires no additional training and
can be integrated with any DFL solvers. Using the sigmoid-like decaying
parameter, we let the prediction loss gradient guide the decision loss gradient
to train a predictive model that optimizes decision quality. Also, we provide a
theoretical convergence guarantee to Pareto stationary point under mild
assumptions. Empirically, we demonstrate our method across three stochastic
optimization problems, showing promising results compared to other baselines.
We validate that our approach achieves lower regret with more stable training,
even in situations where either PFL or DFL struggles.

<details>

Motivation: 现有的联邦学习方法在处理类别不平衡、域偏移和客户端非独立同分布数据时效果有限，需要重新思考从复杂适应方法转向改进特征提取器本身。

Method: 使用预训练的视觉基础模型(VFM)作为冻结的特征提取器，替代传统的FFREEDA骨干网络，无需大量参数调优，直接利用强大的特征表示能力。

Result: 实验结果表明，VFM能有效缓解域差距、类别不平衡和客户端非IID问题，在保持数据隐私的同时显著提升整体准确率。

Conclusion: 强大的特征提取器比复杂的域适应或联邦学习方法更重要，视觉基础模型为现实世界的联邦学习提供了更有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) offers a framework for training models
collaboratively while preserving data privacy of each client. Recently,
research has focused on Federated Source-Free Domain Adaptation (FFREEDA), a
more realistic scenario wherein client-held target domain data remains
unlabeled, and the server can access source domain data only during
pre-training. We extend this framework to a more complex and realistic setting:
Class Imbalanced FFREEDA (CI-FFREEDA), which takes into account class
imbalances in both the source and target domains, as well as label shifts
between source and target and among target clients. The replication of existing
methods in our experimental setup lead us to rethink the focus from enhancing
aggregation and domain adaptation methods to improving the feature extractors
within the network itself. We propose replacing the FFREEDA backbone with a
frozen vision foundation model (VFM), thereby improving overall accuracy
without extensive parameter tuning and reducing computational and communication
costs in federated learning. Our experimental results demonstrate that VFMs
effectively mitigate the effects of domain gaps, class imbalances, and even
non-IID-ness among target clients, suggesting that strong feature extractors,
not complex adaptation or FL methods, are key to success in the real-world FL.

Motivation: 在不可信服务器上处理敏感数据时，同态加密虽能保证数据隐私，但非多项式的argmax和采样操作在加密下计算成本极高，影响实用性

Method: 设计cutmax算法，减少加密操作，支持加密下的贪婪解码；提出首个HE兼容的核心(top-p)采样方法，利用cutmax实现高效随机解码

Result: 在实际LLM输出上实现了24x-35x的延迟降低，提供了可证的隐私保证，并证明cutmax在几次迭代内全局收敛到唯一两级固定点

Conclusion: 该研究提供了高效的多项式方法来支持加密下的文本生成操作，大幅提升了私密保护AI推理的实用性，为安全文本生成领域带来重要进展

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) power modern AI applications, but processing
sensitive data on untrusted servers raises privacy concerns. Homomorphic
encryption (HE) enables computation on encrypted data for secure inference.
However, neural text generation requires decoding methods like argmax and
sampling, which are non-polynomial and thus computationally expensive under
encryption, creating a significant performance bottleneck. We introduce cutmax,
an HE-friendly argmax algorithm that reduces ciphertext operations compared to
prior methods, enabling practical greedy decoding under encryption. We also
propose the first HE-compatible nucleus (top-p) sampling method, leveraging
cutmax for efficient stochastic decoding with provable privacy guarantees. Both
techniques are polynomial, supporting efficient inference in privacy-preserving
settings. Moreover, their differentiability facilitates gradient-based
sequence-level optimization as a polynomial alternative to straight-through
estimators. We further provide strong theoretical guarantees for cutmax,
proving it converges globally to a unique two-level fixed point, independent of
the input values beyond the identity of the maximizer, which explains its rapid
convergence in just a few iterations. Evaluations on realistic LLM outputs show
latency reductions of 24x-35x over baselines, advancing secure text generation.

Motivation: 图基础模型（GFM）在处理多领域图数据时存在领域泛化冲突，导致模型退化和表示坍塌两个主要问题，影响预训练效果。

Method: 提出MoT框架，包含：(1)信息调整器：使用边级语义融合策略和混合码本进行领域感知路由；(2)正则化调整器：增加两个正则化项来改善梯度监督。

Result: 在6个领域的22个数据集上实验表明，MoT在监督学习、少样本和零样本场景下均显著优于现有最佳基线方法。

Conclusion: MoT有效解决了GFM中的信息瓶颈和正则化缺失问题，遵循GFM的缩放定律，提供了可控的模型规模。

Abstract: Graph foundation models, inspired by the success of LLMs, are designed to
learn the optimal embedding from multi-domain TAGs for the downstream
cross-task generalization capability. During our investigation, graph VQ-MAE
stands out among the increasingly diverse landscape of GFM architectures. This
is attributed to its ability to jointly encode topology and textual attributes
from multiple domains into discrete embedding spaces with clear semantic
boundaries. Despite its potential, domain generalization conflicts cause
imperceptible pitfalls. In this paper, we instantiate two of them, and they are
just like two sides of the same GFM optimization coin - Side 1 Model
Degradation: The encoder and codebook fail to capture the diversity of inputs;
Side 2 Representation Collapse: The hidden embedding and codebook vector fail
to preserve semantic separability due to constraints from narrow representation
subspaces. These two pitfalls (sides) collectively impair the decoder and
generate the low-quality reconstructed supervision, causing the GFM
optimization dilemma during pre-training (coin). Through empirical
investigation, we attribute the above challenges to Information Bottleneck and
Regularization Deficit. To address them, we propose MoT (Mixture-of-Tinkers) -
(1) Information Tinker for Two Pitfalls, which utilizes an edge-wise semantic
fusion strategy and a mixture-of-codebooks with domain-aware routing to improve
information capacity. (2) Regularization Tinker for Optimization Coin, which
utilizes two additional regularizations to further improve gradient supervision
in our proposed Information Tinker. Notably, as a flexible architecture, MoT
adheres to the scaling laws of GFM, offering a controllable model scale.
Compared to SOTA baselines, experiments on 22 datasets across 6 domains
demonstrate that MoT achieves significant improvements in supervised, few-shot,
and zero-shot scenarios.

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated their
remarkable capacity to process and reason over structured and unstructured data
modalities beyond natural language. In this work, we explore the applications
of Vision Language Models (VLMs), specifically a fine-tuned variant of LLaMa
3.2, to the task of identifying neutrino interactions in pixelated detector
data from high-energy physics (HEP) experiments. We benchmark this model
against a state-of-the-art convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture,
similar to those used in the NOvA and DUNE experiments, which have achieved
high efficiency and purity in classifying electron and muon neutrino events.
Our evaluation considers both the classification performance and
interpretability of the model predictions. We find that VLMs can outperform
CNNs, while also providing greater flexibility in integrating auxiliary textual
or semantic information and offering more interpretable, reasoning-based
predictions. This work highlights the potential of VLMs as a general-purpose
backbone for physics event classification, due to their high performance,
interpretability, and generalizability, which opens new avenues for integrating

Abstract: This paper introduces the Actuarial Neural Additive Model, an inherently
interpretable deep learning model for general insurance pricing that offers
fully transparent and interpretable results while retaining the strong
predictive power of neural networks. This model assigns a dedicated neural
network (or subnetwork) to each individual covariate and pairwise interaction
term to independently learn its impact on the modeled output while implementing
various architectural constraints to allow for essential interpretability (e.g.
sparsity) and practical requirements (e.g. smoothness, monotonicity) in
insurance applications. The development of our model is grounded in a solid
foundation, where we establish a concrete definition of interpretability within
the insurance context, complemented by a rigorous mathematical framework.
Comparisons in terms of prediction accuracy are made with traditional actuarial
and state-of-the-art machine learning methods using both synthetic and real
insurance datasets. The results show that the proposed model outperforms other
methods in most cases while offering complete transparency in its internal
logic, underscoring the strong interpretability and predictive capability.

Conclusion: SHAining方法能够系统评估事件日志特征对流程挖掘算法性能的影响，为算法选择和评估提供了更全面的分析框架。

Abstract: Process mining aims to extract and analyze insights from event logs, yet
algorithm metric results vary widely depending on structural event log
characteristics. Existing work often evaluates algorithms on a fixed set of
real-world event logs but lacks a systematic analysis of how event log
characteristics impact algorithms individually. Moreover, since event logs are
generated from processes, where characteristics co-occur, we focus on
associational rather than causal effects to assess how strong the overlapping
individual characteristic affects evaluation metrics without assuming isolated
causal effects, a factor often neglected by prior work. We introduce SHAining,
the first approach to quantify the marginal contribution of varying event log
characteristics to process mining algorithms' metrics. Using process discovery
as a downstream task, we analyze over 22,000 event logs covering a wide span of
characteristics to uncover which affect algorithms across metrics (e.g.,
fitness, precision, complexity) the most. Furthermore, we offer novel insights
about how the value of event log characteristics correlates with their
contributed impact, assessing the algorithm's robustness.

Motivation: 研究梯度下降中重球动量算法的数学性质，揭示其与修改损失函数的普通梯度下降之间的等价关系，为理解动量算法的机理提供理论支撑。

Method: 基于Kovachki和Stuart(2021)的工作，在指数吸引不变流形上分析算法，推导记忆无近似的组合数学，构建任意阶连续修正方程和主流动近似。

Result: 证明了步长足够小时HB算法等价于修改损失函数的梯度下降，获得了O(h^R)的全局近似误差界，发现了包含Eulerian和Narayana多项式的丰富多项式族。

Conclusion: 理论结果揭示了重球动量梯度下降的主要特征，为分析其他优化算法提供了路线图，覆盖了全批次和小批次HB的近似定理。

Abstract: We analyze gradient descent with Polyak heavy-ball momentum (HB) whose fixed
momentum parameter $\beta \in (0, 1)$ provides exponential decay of memory.
Building on Kovachki and Stuart (2021), we prove that on an exponentially
attractive invariant manifold the algorithm is exactly plain gradient descent
with a modified loss, provided that the step size $h$ is small enough. Although
the modified loss does not admit a closed-form expression, we describe it with
arbitrary precision and prove global (finite "time" horizon) approximation
bounds $O(h^{R})$ for any finite order $R \geq 2$. We then conduct a
fine-grained analysis of the combinatorics underlying the memoryless
approximations of HB, in particular, finding a rich family of polynomials in
$\beta$ hidden inside which contains Eulerian and Narayana polynomials. We
derive continuous modified equations of arbitrary approximation order (with
rigorous bounds) and the principal flow that approximates the HB dynamics,
generalizing Rosca et al. (2023). Approximation theorems cover both full-batch
and mini-batch HB. Our theoretical results shed new light on the main features
of gradient descent with heavy-ball momentum, and outline a road-map for
similar analysis of other optimization algorithms.

*Chisom Chibuike,Adeyinka Ogunsanya*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 这篇论文通过对比十种优化器在心脏病预测任务中的性能，发现RMSProp在收敛速度、稳定性和分类指标方面表现最佳，建议通过综合评估选择优化器。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习模型训练中优化器选择得到较少关注，需要深入研究优化器选择标准和评估指标。

Method: 使用心脏病数据集训练多层感知机模型，在一致的训练范式下比较10种优化器的收敛速度、稳定性、AUC、精度和召回率等指标。

Result: RMSProp表现最佳：精度0.765、召回率0.827、AUC 0.841，训练时间较快，但稳定性不是最好。Adagrad和Adadelta更稳定但收敛更慢。

Conclusion: 建议在计算资源充足的情况下，通过综合评估指标来选择优化器，以提高深度学习模型训练的科学性和性能。

Abstract: Optimization has been an important factor and topic of interest in training
deep learning models, yet less attention has been given to how we select the
optimizers we use to train these models. Hence, there is a need to dive deeper
into how we select the optimizers we use for training and the metrics that
determine this selection. In this work, we compare the performance of 10
different optimizers in training a simple Multi-layer Perceptron model using a
heart disease dataset from Kaggle. We set up a consistent training paradigm and
evaluate the optimizers based on metrics such as convergence speed and
stability. We also include some other Machine Learning Evaluation metrics such
as AUC, Precision, and Recall, which are central metrics to classification
problems. Our results show that there are trade-offs between convergence speed
and stability, as optimizers like Adagrad and Adadelta, which are more stable,
took longer time to converge. Across all our metrics, we chose RMSProp to be
the most effective optimizer for this heart disease prediction task because it
offered a balanced performance across key metrics. It achieved a precision of
0.765, a recall of 0.827, and an AUC of 0.841, along with faster training time.
However, it was not the most stable. We recommend that, in less
compute-constrained environments, this method of choosing optimizers through a
thorough evaluation should be adopted to increase the scientific nature and
performance in training deep learning models.

TL;DR: 提出结合变分秩降维自编码器(VRRAE)和深度算子网络(DeepONet)的混合框架，用于复杂几何形状的生成式热设计，解决了传统方法在高计算成本和潜在空间不连续性方面的限制。


<details>

Motivation: 传统生成模型如自编码器和变分自编码器在热设计中面临高计算成本和潜在空间不连续的问题，限制了设计探索和物理一致性解决方案的生成能力。

Method: 使用VRRAE在潜在空间中引入截断SVD，获得连续、可解释的结构化表示；然后利用DeepONet，在其分支网络中使用紧凑潜在编码，在主干网络中使用空间坐标，高效准确地预测温度梯度。

Result: 该方法不仅提高了生成几何形状的质量和梯度预测的准确性，而且在推理效率上相比传统数值求解器具有显著优势。

Conclusion: 研究强调了结构化潜在表示对算子学习的重要性，并展示了生成模型与算子网络结合在热设计和更广泛工程应用中的潜力。

Abstract: Generative thermal design for complex geometries is fundamental in many areas
of engineering, yet it faces two main challenges: the high computational cost
of high-fidelity simulations and the limitations of conventional generative
models. Approaches such as autoencoders (AEs) and variational autoencoders
(VAEs) often produce unstructured latent spaces with discontinuities, which
restricts their capacity to explore designs and generate physically consistent
solutions.
  To address these limitations, we propose a hybrid framework that combines
Variational Rank-Reduction Autoencoders (VRRAEs) with Deep Operator Networks
(DeepONets). The VRRAE introduces a truncated SVD within the latent space,
leading to continuous, interpretable, and well-structured representations that
mitigate posterior collapse and improve geometric reconstruction. The DeepONet
then exploits this compact latent encoding in its branch network, together with
spatial coordinates in the trunk network, to predict temperature gradients
efficiently and accurately.
  This hybrid approach not only enhances the quality of generated geometries
and the accuracy of gradient prediction, but also provides a substantial
advantage in inference efficiency compared to traditional numerical solvers.
Overall, the study underscores the importance of structured latent
representations for operator learning and highlights the potential of combining
generative models and operator networks in thermal design and broader
engineering applications.

Abstract: In this work, we focus on the efficiency and scalability of pairwise
constraint-based active clustering, crucial for processing large-scale data in
applications such as data mining, knowledge annotation, and AI model
pre-training. Our goals are threefold: (1) to reduce computational costs for
iterative clustering updates; (2) to enhance the impact of user-provided
constraints to minimize annotation requirements for precise clustering; and (3)
to cut down memory usage in practical deployments. To achieve these aims, we
propose a graph-based active clustering algorithm that utilizes two sparse
graphs: one for representing relationships between data (our proposed data
skeleton) and another for updating this data skeleton. These two graphs work in
concert, enabling the refinement of connected subgraphs within the data
skeleton to create nested clusters. Our empirical analysis confirms that the
proposed algorithm consistently facilitates more accurate clustering with
dramatically less input of user-provided constraints, and outperforms its
counterparts in terms of computational performance and scalability, while
maintaining robustness across various distance metrics.

Abstract: Timely and robust influenza incidence forecasting is critical for public
health decision-making. To address this, we present MAESTRO, a Multi-modal
Adaptive Ensemble for Spectro-Temporal Robust Optimization. MAESTRO achieves
robustness by adaptively fusing multi-modal inputs-including surveillance, web
search trends, and meteorological data-and leveraging a comprehensive
spectro-temporal architecture. The model first decomposes time series into
seasonal and trend components. These are then processed through a hybrid
feature enhancement pipeline combining Transformer-based encoders, a Mamba
state-space model for long-range dependencies, multi-scale temporal
convolutions, and a frequency-domain analysis module. A cross-channel attention
mechanism further integrates information across the different data modalities.
Finally, a temporal projection head performs sequence-to-sequence forecasting,
with an optional estimator to quantify prediction uncertainty. Evaluated on
over 11 years of Hong Kong influenza data (excluding the COVID-19 period),
MAESTRO shows strong competitive performance, demonstrating a superior model
fit and relative accuracy, achieving a state-of-the-art R-square of 0.956.
Extensive ablations confirm the significant contributions of both multi-modal
fusion and the spectro-temporal components. Our modular and reproducible
pipeline is made publicly available to facilitate deployment and extension to
other regions and pathogens.Our publicly available pipeline presents a
powerful, unified framework, demonstrating the critical synergy of advanced
spectro-temporal modeling and multi-modal data fusion for robust
epidemiological forecasting.

TL;DR: 深度学习算法使用原始加速度信号在24小时运动行为分类中表现略好于传统机器学习算法，但优势不明显


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 比较深度学习和传统机器学习算法在分类24小时运动行为（睡眠、坐着、轻度和中高强度运动）方面的性能差异

Method: 使用151名成年人的手腕加速度计数据，采用4种DL算法（LSTM、BiLSTM、GRU、1D-CNN）和6种传统ML算法（RF、SVM、XGBoost、LR、ANN、DT），分别使用原始信号和624个手工特征进行训练

Result: DL算法使用原始信号达到85%准确率，1D-CNN达到80%；使用手工特征时准确率为70-81%。MVPA和LPA分类错误较多，睡眠和坐着分类较准

Conclusion: 深度学习使用原始加速度信号在24小时运动行为分类中仅略好于传统机器学习算法，性能差异不明显

Abstract: Purpose: We compared the performance of deep learning (DL) and classical
machine learning (ML) algorithms for the classification of 24-hour movement
behavior into sleep, sedentary, light intensity physical activity (LPA), and
moderate-to-vigorous intensity physical activity (MVPA). Methods: Open-access
data from 151 adults wearing a wrist-worn accelerometer (Axivity-AX3) was used.
Participants were randomly divided into training, validation, and test sets
(121, 15, and 15 participants each). Raw acceleration signals were segmented
into non-overlapping 10-second windows, and then a total of 104 handcrafted
features were extracted. Four DL algorithms-Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM),
Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM), Gated Recurrent Units (GRU), and
One-Dimensional Convolutional Neural Network (1D-CNN)-were trained using raw
acceleration signals and with handcrafted features extracted from these signals
to predict 24-hour movement behavior categories. The handcrafted features were
also used to train classical ML algorithms, namely Random Forest (RF), Support
Vector Machine (SVM), Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), Logistic Regression
(LR), Artificial Neural Network (ANN), and Decision Tree (DT) for classifying
24-hour movement behavior intensities. Results: LSTM, BiLSTM, and GRU showed an
overall accuracy of approximately 85% when trained with raw acceleration
signals, and 1D-CNN an overall accuracy of approximately 80%. When trained on
handcrafted features, the overall accuracy for both DL and classical ML
algorithms ranged from 70% to 81%. Overall, there was a higher confusion in
classification of MVPA and LPA, compared to sleep and sedentary categories.
Conclusion: DL methods with raw acceleration signals had only slightly better
performance in predicting 24-hour movement behavior intensities, compared to
when DL and classical ML were trained with handcrafted features.

Motivation: 虽然针对表格数据的DNNs在预测性能上表现优异，但它们缺乏可解释性，这在金融和医疗等关键应用领域是一个重要问题。

Method: 使用稀疏自编码器(SAE)在潜在空间中学习单语义特征字典，并通过自动化方法为这些特征分配人类可解释的语义，使预测结果能够表示为语义上有意义的分量的线性组合。

Result: 实证评估表明，XNNTab在性能上与或超过最先进的黑盒神经网络模型和经典机器学习方法，同时保持完全可解释性。

Conclusion: XNNTab成功解决了表格数据神经网络模型的可解释性问题，在保持高性能的同时提供了完全透明的预测解释，为关键应用领域提供了可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Tabular data is the foundation of many applications in fields such as finance
and healthcare. Although DNNs tailored for tabular data achieve competitive
predictive performance, they are blackboxes with little interpretability. We
introduce XNNTab, a neural architecture that uses a sparse autoencoder (SAE) to
learn a dictionary of monosemantic features within the latent space used for
prediction. Using an automated method, we assign human-interpretable semantics
to these features. This allows us to represent predictions as linear
combinations of semantically meaningful components. Empirical evaluations
demonstrate that XNNTab attains performance on par with or exceeding that of
state-of-the-art, black-box neural models and classical machine learning
approaches while being fully interpretable.

*Hugo Sträng,Tai Dinh*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了针对轮廓系数的新上界计算方法，为每个数据点推导出尖锐的个体上界，并聚合得到数据集相关的ASW上界，显著提升了聚类质量评估能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的轮廓系数ASW评估中，标准上限1通常无法达到，且数据集特定的最大ASW值未知，这限制了聚类质量评估的准确性。

Method: 为每个数据点推导出其轮廓宽度的尖锐上界，通过聚合这些个体界限得到数据依赖的ASW上界，该界限通常远低于1。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上，所提出的界限在许多情况下被证明接近紧致，显著丰富了聚类质量评估。

Conclusion: 该方法能够指示单个数据点是否能被良好放置，支持基于轮廓的优化循环的早期停止，并帮助回答聚类结果与最佳可能结果的接近程度问题。

Abstract: The silhouette coefficient summarizes, per observation, cohesion versus
separation in [-1, 1]; the average silhouette width (ASW) is a common internal
measure of clustering quality where higher values indicate more coveted
results. However, the dataset-specific maximum of ASW is typically unknown, and
the standard upper limit 1 is often unattainable. In this work, we derive for
each data point in a given dataset a sharp upper bound on its silhouette width.
By aggregating these individual bounds, we present a canonical data-dependent
upper bound on ASW that often assumes values well below 1. The presented bounds
can indicate whether individual data points can ever be well placed, enable
early stopping of silhouette-based optimization loops, and help answer a key
question: How close is my clustering result to the best possible outcome on
this specific data? Across synthetic and real datasets, the bounds are provably
near-tight in many cases and offer significant enrichment of cluster quality
evaluation.

Motivation: 随着训练数据需求超过网络索引数据增长速度，面临数据耗尽问题。用户生成内容虽多但包含隐私和不良内容风险，需要安全的数据处理方法

Method: 提出生成式数据精炼(GDR)框架，使用预训练生成模型对原始数据集进行条件生成，生成保持多样性但去除不良内容的合成数据

Result: GDR在数据集匿名化方面优于工业级解决方案，能够直接对高度不安全数据集进行净化，生成的数据自然匹配网络规模数据集的多样性

Conclusion: GDR的简单性和有效性使其成为扩展前沿模型训练数据总量的强大工具，解决了数据质量和多样性挑战

Abstract: For a fixed parameter size, the capabilities of large models are primarily
determined by the quality and quantity of its training data. Consequently,
training datasets now grow faster than the rate at which new data is indexed on
the web, leading to projected data exhaustion over the next decade. Much more
data exists as user-generated content that is not publicly indexed, but
incorporating such data comes with considerable risks, such as leaking private
information and other undesirable content. We introduce a framework, Generative
Data Refinement (GDR), for using pretrained generative models to transform a
dataset with undesirable content into a refined dataset that is more suitable
for training. Our experiments show that GDR can outperform industry-grade
solutions for dataset anonymization, as well as enable direct detoxification of
highly unsafe datasets. Moreover, we show that by generating synthetic data
that is conditioned on each example in the real dataset, GDR's refined outputs
naturally match the diversity of web scale datasets, and thereby avoid the
often challenging task of generating diverse synthetic data via model
prompting. The simplicity and effectiveness of GDR make it a powerful tool for
scaling up the total stock of training data for frontier models.

Conclusion: 这项工作在函数逼近强化学习的可复制性方面取得了重要进展，为开发更一致的神经网络策略提供了基础

Abstract: Replication of experimental results has been a challenge faced by many
scientific disciplines, including the field of machine learning. Recent work on
the theory of machine learning has formalized replicability as the demand that
an algorithm produce identical outcomes when executed twice on different
samples from the same distribution. Provably replicable algorithms are
especially interesting for reinforcement learning (RL), where algorithms are
known to be unstable in practice. While replicable algorithms exist for tabular
RL settings, extending these guarantees to more practical function
approximation settings has remained an open problem. In this work, we make
progress by developing replicable methods for linear function approximation in
RL. We first introduce two efficient algorithms for replicable random design
regression and uncentered covariance estimation, each of independent interest.
We then leverage these tools to provide the first provably efficient replicable
RL algorithms for linear Markov decision processes in both the generative model
and episodic settings. Finally, we evaluate our algorithms experimentally and
show how they can inspire more consistent neural policies.

Method: 构建模拟框架生成2,500个合成数据集，SFI包含六个可解释组件：诊断特异性、时间一致性、熵、上下文一致性、药物对齐和轨迹稳定性。SFI感知校准应用乘法调整优化

Result: 在最优参数(α=2.0)下，SFI感知校准显著改善所有指标(p<0.001)，平衡准确率提升10.3%，召回率提升32.5%，精确率提升31.9%，F1分数提升26.1%

Conclusion: 诊断信号衰减是模型泛化的可处理障碍，SFI感知校准为缺乏结果标签的大规模管理数据集提供了实用的无标签策略来增强跨医疗环境的预测能力

Abstract: \textbf{Background:} Machine learning models trained on electronic health
records (EHRs) often degrade across healthcare systems due to distributional
shift. A fundamental but underexplored factor is diagnostic signal decay:
variability in diagnostic quality and consistency across institutions, which
affects the reliability of codes used for training and prediction.
  \textbf{Objective:} To develop a Signal Fidelity Index (SFI) quantifying
diagnostic data quality at the patient level in dementia, and to test SFI-aware
calibration for improving model performance across heterogeneous datasets
without outcome labels.
  \textbf{Methods:} We built a simulation framework generating 2,500 synthetic
datasets, each with 1,000 patients and realistic demographics, encounters, and
coding patterns based on dementia risk factors. The SFI was derived from six
interpretable components: diagnostic specificity, temporal consistency,
entropy, contextual concordance, medication alignment, and trajectory
stability. SFI-aware calibration applied a multiplicative adjustment, optimized
across 50 simulation batches.
  \textbf{Results:} At the optimal parameter ($\alpha$ = 2.0), SFI-aware
calibration significantly improved all metrics (p $<$ 0.001). Gains ranged from
10.3\% for Balanced Accuracy to 32.5\% for Recall, with notable increases in
Precision (31.9\%) and F1-score (26.1\%). Performance approached reference
standards, with F1-score and Recall within 1\% and Balanced Accuracy and
Detection Rate improved by 52.3\% and 41.1\%, respectively.
  \textbf{Conclusions:} Diagnostic signal decay is a tractable barrier to model
generalization. SFI-aware calibration provides a practical, label-free strategy
to enhance prediction across healthcare contexts, particularly for large-scale
administrative datasets lacking outcome labels.

Abstract: In federated learning, multiple parties train models locally and share their
parameters with a central server, which aggregates them to update a global
model. To address the risk of exposing sensitive data through local models,
secure aggregation via secure multiparty computation has been proposed to
enhance privacy. At the same time, perfect privacy can only be achieved by a
uniform distribution of the masked local models to be aggregated. This raises a
problem when working with real valued data, as there is no measure on the reals
that is invariant under the masking operation, and hence information leakage is
bound to occur. Shifting the data to a finite field circumvents this problem,
but as a downside runs into an inherent accuracy complexity tradeoff issue due
to fixed point modular arithmetic as opposed to floating point numbers that can
simultaneously handle numbers of varying magnitudes. In this paper, a novel
secure parameter aggregation method is proposed that employs the torus rather
than a finite field. This approach guarantees perfect privacy for each party's
data by utilizing the uniform distribution on the torus, while avoiding
accuracy losses. Experimental results show that the new protocol performs
similarly to the model without secure aggregation while maintaining perfect
privacy. Compared to the finite field secure aggregation, the torus-based
protocol can in some cases significantly outperform it in terms of model
accuracy and cosine similarity, hence making it a safer choice.

Conclusion: FAUST成功地将Forward-Forward算法的生物合理性与相似性学习框架相结合，在保持推理效率的同时大幅缩小了与反向传播算法的准确率差距。

Abstract: Backpropagation is the pivotal algorithm underpinning the success of
artificial neural networks, yet it has critical limitations such as
biologically implausible backward locking and global error propagation. To
circumvent these constraints, the Forward-Forward algorithm was proposed as a
more biologically plausible method that replaces the backward pass with an
additional forward pass. Despite this advantage, the Forward-Forward algorithm
significantly trails backpropagation in accuracy, and its optimal form exhibits
low inference efficiency due to multiple forward passes required. In this work,
the Forward-Forward algorithm is reshaped through its integration with
similarity learning frameworks, eliminating the need for multiple forward
passes during inference. This proposed algorithm is named Forward-Forward
Algorithm Unified with Similarity-based Tuplet loss (FAUST). Empirical
evaluations on MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, and CIFAR-10 datasets indicate that FAUST
substantially improves accuracy, narrowing the gap with backpropagation. On
CIFAR-10, FAUST achieves 56.22\% accuracy with a simple multi-layer perceptron
architecture, approaching the backpropagation benchmark of 57.63\% accuracy.

without manual effort, enabling supervised training and precise evaluation of
anomaly detection. Additionally, we define a taxonomy that groups anomalies
into three categories, ensuring appropriate method selection. The second layer,
Anomaly Detection, detects behaviors deviating from the norm. We propose a
flexible Anomaly Detection method adaptable to unsupervised, weakly supervised,
and supervised training. Evaluations on public and industry datasets show
F1-scores between 0.98 and 1.0, ensuring reliable anomaly detection. The third
layer, Root Cause Analysis, identifies minimal log sets describing failures,
their origin, and event sequences. By balancing training data and identifying
key services, our Root Cause Analysis method consistently detects 90-98% of
root cause log lines within the top 10 candidates, providing actionable
insights for mitigation. Our research addresses how log analysis methods can be
designed and optimized to help DevOps resolve failures efficiently. By
integrating these three layers, the architecture equips teams with robust
methods to enhance IT system reliability.

TL;DR: 使用机器学习模型分析ECoG数据，结合解剖学和功能连接性特征，预测脑部区域是否为语言关键区，提供了无创的功能映射方案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 电制刺激映射(ESM)虽是临床金标准，但依然是侵入性且耗时的方法，需要开发更高效无创的替代方案来识别语言关键脑区域。

Method: 分析16名参与者的脑内电脑图(ECoG)数据，结合电制刺激映射的真实标签训练分类模型。整合神经活动信号、解剖学区域标签和功能连接性特征，使用RBF核支持向量机和MLP聚合方法进行预测。

Result: 最佳模型在指定测试集上达到了高准确性(ROC-AUC: 0.87, PR-AUC: 0.57)，结合区域和连接性特征的模型表现最佳。

Conclusion: 空间和网络信息的结合，加上非线性建模方法，能够显著提升本前手术评估中的功能映射效果。

Abstract: Identifying cortical regions critical for speech is essential for safe brain
surgery in or near language areas. While Electrical Stimulation Mapping (ESM)
remains the clinical gold standard, it is invasive and time-consuming. To
address this, we analyzed intracranial electrocorticographic (ECoG) data from
16 participants performing speech tasks and developed machine learning models
to directly predict if the brain region underneath each ECoG electrode is
critical. Ground truth labels indicating speech arrest were derived
independently from Electrical Stimulation Mapping (ESM) and used to train
classification models. Our framework integrates neural activity signals,
anatomical region labels, and functional connectivity features to capture both
local activity and network-level dynamics. We found that models combining
region and connectivity features matched the performance of the full feature
set, and outperformed models using either type alone. To classify each
electrode, trial-level predictions were aggregated using an MLP applied to
histogram-encoded scores. Our best-performing model, a trial-level RBF-kernel
Support Vector Machine together with MLP-based aggregation, achieved strong
accuracy on held-out participants (ROC-AUC: 0.87, PR-AUC: 0.57). These findings
highlight the value of combining spatial and network information with
non-linear modeling to improve functional mapping in presurgical evaluation.

*Shun Takagi,Satoshi Hasegawa*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于临时TEE模块的服务器扩展方案，实现恶意安全环境下的差分隐私联邦学习，通过可验证证明和客户端审计机制，在保持系统可扩展性的同时减少可信计算基的大小。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有DP-FTRL方法假设半诚实服务器，无法应对客户端退出或被腐化的实际场景。虽然TEE看似是解决方案，但直接实现会引入分叉攻击或可用性问题。

Method: 在服务器端部署临时TEE模块作为可信计算基，生成服务器操作的可验证证明。被选中的客户端参与审计这些证明，通信和计算开销很小。

Result: 形式化证明显示在恶意设置下仍能保证隐私性。实验表明在多种现实设置中，该框架仅给客户端带来很小的常数级开销。

Conclusion: 该方案成功解决了恶意服务器假设下的DP-FTRL安全问题，通过创新的TEE架构设计实现了安全性和实用性的平衡。

Abstract: In cross-device private federated learning, differentially private
follow-the-regularized-leader (DP-FTRL) has emerged as a promising
privacy-preserving method. However, existing approaches assume a semi-honest
server and have not addressed the challenge of securely removing this
assumption. This is due to its statefulness, which becomes particularly
problematic in practical settings where clients can drop out or be corrupted.
While trusted execution environments (TEEs) might seem like an obvious
solution, a straightforward implementation can introduce forking attacks or
availability issues due to state management. To address this problem, our paper
introduces a novel server extension that acts as a trusted computing base (TCB)
to realize maliciously secure DP-FTRL. The TCB is implemented with an ephemeral
TEE module on the server side to produce verifiable proofs of server actions.
Some clients, upon being selected, participate in auditing these proofs with
small additional communication and computational demands. This extension
solution reduces the size of the TCB while maintaining the system's scalability
and liveness. We provide formal proofs based on interactive differential
privacy, demonstrating privacy guarantee in malicious settings. Finally, we
experimentally show that our framework adds small constant overhead to clients
in several realistic settings.

Motivation: 因为CNN模型越来越大越复杂，在边缘设备上部署遇到挑战，需要通过模型压缩技术来减小模型规模和复杂度。

Method: 受EfficientNet启发，提出了一种混合剪枝框架，同时从通道和层两个维度进行缩小操作，逆向应用EfficientNet的扩展原理。

Result: 实验结果显示，该方法能够显著降低模型的总体复杂度，而准确性与基准模型相比仅有最小降低。在NVIDIA JETSON TX2嵌入式设备上部署时，延迟显著减少。

Conclusion: 混合剪枝框架是一种有效的模型压缩方法，能够在准确性损失最小的情况下，大幅度降低模型复杂度和部署延迟，适合边缘设备部署。

Abstract: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have achieved significant breakthroughs
in various fields. However, these advancements have led to a substantial
increase in the complexity and size of these networks. This poses a challenge
when deploying large and complex networks on edge devices. Consequently, model
compression has emerged as a research field aimed at reducing the size and
complexity of CNNs. One prominent technique in model compression is model
pruning. This paper will present a new technique of pruning that combines both
channel and layer pruning in what is called a "hybrid pruning framework".
Inspired by EfficientNet, a renowned CNN architecture known for scaling up
networks from both channel and layer perspectives, this hybrid approach applies
the same principles but in reverse, where it scales down the network through
pruning. Experiments on the hybrid approach demonstrated a notable decrease in
the overall complexity of the model, with only a minimal reduction in accuracy
compared to the baseline model. This complexity reduction translates into
reduced latency when deploying the pruned models on an NVIDIA JETSON TX2
embedded AI device.

TL;DR: SAPO是一种完全去中心化的异步RL后训练算法，专为异构计算节点网络设计，解决了传统RL训练中的并行化挑战和成本问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RL后训练需要大规模并行化推理，带来延迟、内存、可靠性等技术挑战以及高昂的财务成本，需要一种更高效的去中心化解决方案。

Method: SAPO算法在异构计算节点网络中运行，每个节点管理自己的策略模型，通过网络"共享"rollouts，无需假设延迟、模型同质性或硬件要求，支持节点独立运行。

Result: 在控制实验中，SAPO实现了高达94%的累积奖励增益；在数千个节点的开源演示网络中，算法在多样化硬件和模型上成功运行。

Conclusion: SAPO有效解决了RL后训练的扩展瓶颈，通过去中心化网络共享rollouts实现知识传播，为大规模语言模型后训练提供了可行的分布式解决方案。

Abstract: Post-training language models (LMs) with reinforcement learning (RL) can
enhance their complex reasoning capabilities without supervised fine-tuning, as
demonstrated by DeepSeek-R1-Zero. However, effectively utilizing RL for LMs
requires significant parallelization to scale-up inference, which introduces
non-trivial technical challenges (e.g. latency, memory, and reliability)
alongside ever-growing financial costs. We present Swarm sAmpling Policy
Optimization (SAPO), a fully decentralized and asynchronous RL post-training
algorithm. SAPO is designed for decentralized networks of heterogenous compute
nodes, where each node manages its own policy model(s) while "sharing" rollouts
with others in the network; no explicit assumptions about latency, model
homogeneity, or hardware are required and nodes can operate in silo if desired.
As a result, the algorithm avoids common bottlenecks in scaling RL
post-training while also allowing (and even encouraging) new possibilities. By
sampling rollouts "shared" across the network, it enables "Aha moments" to
propagate, thereby bootstrapping the learning process. In this paper we show
SAPO achieved cumulative reward gains of up to 94% in controlled experiments.
We also share insights from tests on a network with thousands of nodes
contributed by Gensyn community members running the algorithm on diverse
hardware and models during an open-source demo.

Motivation: 传统的蒙特卡洛模拟方法需要显式指定随机微分方程的流洒和渗透系数，而实际应用中这些参数常常未知。需要一种无模型的数据驱动方法来生成新的样本路径。

Method: 采用条件渗透模型，基于给定的有限样本路径集，生成同一随机微分方程的新的合成路径。通过模拟实验与神经随机微分方程等基准方法进行比较。

Result: 方法能够有效生成随机微分方程的样本路径。在实证研究中，使用合成路径明显提升了连续时间均值-方差资产配置问题中强化学习算法的性能。

Conclusion: 渗透模型在金融分析和决策中具有广阔的应用前景，能够通过数据驱动的方式生成合成样本路径，为复杂金融问题提供有效解决方案。

Abstract: This paper introduces a new approach to generating sample paths of unknown
stochastic differential equations (SDEs) using diffusion models, a class of
generative AI models commonly employed in image and video applications. Unlike
the traditional Monte Carlo methods for simulating SDEs, which require explicit
specifications of the drift and diffusion coefficients, our method takes a
model-free, data-driven approach. Given a finite set of sample paths from an
SDE, we utilize conditional diffusion models to generate new, synthetic paths
of the same SDE. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, we conduct a
simulation experiment to compare our method with alternative benchmark ones
including neural SDEs. Furthermore, in an empirical study we leverage these
synthetically generated sample paths to enhance the performance of
reinforcement learning algorithms for continuous-time mean-variance portfolio
selection, hinting promising applications of diffusion models in financial
analysis and decision-making.

Conclusion: 利用分子动力学模拟的连续性特征，通过深度平衡模型重用中间特征，可显著提升力场模型的性能和效率

Abstract: Machine learning force fields show great promise in enabling more accurate
molecular dynamics simulations compared to manually derived ones. Much of the
progress in recent years was driven by exploiting prior knowledge about
physical systems, in particular symmetries under rotation, translation, and
reflections. In this paper, we argue that there is another important piece of
prior information that, thus fa,r hasn't been explored: Simulating a molecular
system is necessarily continuous, and successive states are therefore extremely
similar. Our contribution is to show that we can exploit this information by
recasting a state-of-the-art equivariant base model as a deep equilibrium
model. This allows us to recycle intermediate neural network features from
previous time steps, enabling us to improve both accuracy and speed by
$10\%-20\%$ on the MD17, MD22, and OC20 200k datasets, compared to the non-DEQ
base model. The training is also much more memory efficient, allowing us to
train more expressive models on larger systems.

Motivation: 贝叶斯优化在化学应用中常因实验数据稀疏和反应机制复杂而效率受限，需要新的方法来克服这些限制。

Method: 结合LLM的两阶段优化策略：1）知识驱动的粗粒度优化阶段，LLM基于化学知识分解搜索空间识别候选区域；2）数据驱动的细粒度优化阶段，LLM生成伪数据点增强BO过程。

Conclusion: ChemBOMAS是一个强大的工具，能够加速化学发现过程，在真实世界应用中表现出色。

Abstract: The efficiency of Bayesian optimization (BO) in chemistry is often hindered
by sparse experimental data and complex reaction mechanisms. To overcome these
limitations, we introduce ChemBOMAS, a new framework named LLM-Enhanced
Multi-Agent System for accelerating BO in chemistry. ChemBOMAS's optimization
process is enhanced by LLMs and synergistically employs two strategies:
knowledge-driven coarse-grained optimization and data-driven fine-grained
optimization. First, in the knowledge-driven coarse-grained optimization stage,
LLMs intelligently decompose the vast search space by reasoning over existing
chemical knowledge to identify promising candidate regions. Subsequently, in
the data-driven fine-grained optimization stage, LLMs enhance the BO process
within these candidate regions by generating pseudo-data points, thereby
improving data utilization efficiency and accelerating convergence. Benchmark
evaluations** further confirm that ChemBOMAS significantly enhances
optimization effectiveness and efficiency compared to various BO algorithms.
Importantly, the practical utility of ChemBOMAS was validated through wet-lab
experiments conducted under pharmaceutical industry protocols, targeting
conditional optimization for a previously unreported and challenging chemical
reaction. In the wet experiment, ChemBOMAS achieved an optimal objective value
of 96%. This was substantially higher than the 15% achieved by domain experts.
This real-world success, together with strong performance on benchmark
evaluations, highlights ChemBOMAS as a powerful tool to accelerate chemical
discovery.

Abstract: Developing autonomous LLM agents capable of making a series of intelligent
decisions to solve complex, real-world tasks is a fast-evolving frontier. Like
human cognitive development, agents are expected to acquire knowledge and
skills through exploration and interaction with the environment. Despite
advances, the community still lacks a unified, interactive reinforcement
learning (RL) framework that can effectively train such agents from scratch --
without relying on supervised fine-tuning (SFT) -- across diverse and realistic
environments. To bridge this gap, we introduce AgentGym-RL, a new framework to
train LLM agents for multi-turn interactive decision-making through RL. The
framework features a modular and decoupled architecture, ensuring high
flexibility and extensibility. It encompasses a wide variety of real-world
scenarios, and supports mainstream RL algorithms. Furthermore, we propose
ScalingInter-RL, a training approach designed for exploration-exploitation
balance and stable RL optimization. In early stages, it emphasizes exploitation
by restricting the number of interactions, and gradually shifts towards
exploration with larger horizons to encourage diverse problem-solving
strategies. In this way, the agent develops more diverse behaviors and is less
prone to collapse under long horizons. We perform extensive experiments to
validate the stability and effectiveness of both the AgentGym-RL framework and
the ScalingInter-RL approach. Our agents match or surpass commercial models on
27 tasks across diverse environments. We offer key insights and will
open-source the complete AgentGym-RL framework -- including code and datasets
-- to empower the research community in developing the next generation of
intelligent agents.

Abstract: Mass casualty incidents (MCIs) overwhelm healthcare systems and demand rapid,
accurate patient-hospital allocation decisions under extreme pressure. Here, we
developed and validated a deep reinforcement learning-based decision-support AI
agent to optimize patient transfer decisions during simulated MCIs by balancing
patient acuity levels, specialized care requirements, hospital capacities, and
transport logistics. To integrate this AI agent, we developed MasTER, a
web-accessible command dashboard for MCI management simulations. Through a
controlled user study with 30 participants (6 trauma experts and 24
non-experts), we evaluated three interaction approaches with the AI agent
(human-only, human-AI collaboration, and AI-only) across 20- and 60-patient MCI
scenarios in the Greater Toronto Area. Results demonstrate that increasing AI
involvement significantly improves decision quality and consistency. The AI
agent outperforms trauma surgeons (p < 0.001) and enables non-experts to
achieve expert-level performance when assisted, contrasting sharply with their
significantly inferior unassisted performance (p < 0.001). These findings
establish the potential for our AI-driven decision support to enhance both MCI

Conclusion: FLM是首个能够使用标准MLP架构表示多维完整可分傅里叶基的网络，为科学计算提供了有效的频谱表示方法。

Abstract: We introduce the Fourier Learning Machine (FLM), a neural network (NN)
architecture designed to represent a multidimensional nonharmonic Fourier
series. The FLM uses a simple feedforward structure with cosine activation
functions to learn the frequencies, amplitudes, and phase shifts of the series
as trainable parameters. This design allows the model to create a
problem-specific spectral basis adaptable to both periodic and nonperiodic
functions. Unlike previous Fourier-inspired NN models, the FLM is the first
architecture able to represent a complete, separable Fourier basis in multiple
dimensions using a standard Multilayer Perceptron-like architecture. A
one-to-one correspondence between the Fourier coefficients and amplitudes and
phase-shifts is demonstrated, allowing for the translation between a full,
separable basis form and the cosine phase--shifted one. Additionally, we
evaluate the performance of FLMs on several scientific computing problems,
including benchmark Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) and a family of
Optimal Control Problems (OCPs). Computational experiments show that the
performance of FLMs is comparable, and often superior, to that of established
architectures like SIREN and vanilla feedforward NNs.

Abstract: Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is a common brain disorder in
children that can persist into adulthood, affecting social, academic, and
career life. Early diagnosis is crucial for managing these impacts on patients
and the healthcare system but is often labor-intensive and time-consuming. This
paper presents a novel method to improve ADHD diagnosis precision and
timeliness by leveraging Deep Learning (DL) approaches and electroencephalogram
(EEG) signals. We introduce ADHDeepNet, a DL model that utilizes comprehensive
temporal-spatial characterization, attention modules, and explainability
techniques optimized for EEG signals. ADHDeepNet integrates feature extraction
and refinement processes to enhance ADHD diagnosis. The model was trained and
validated on a dataset of 121 participants (61 ADHD, 60 Healthy Controls),
employing nested cross-validation for robust performance. The proposed
two-stage methodology uses a 10-fold cross-subject validation strategy.
Initially, each iteration optimizes the model's hyper-parameters with inner
2-fold cross-validation. Then, Additive Gaussian Noise (AGN) with various
standard deviations and magnification levels is applied for data augmentation.
ADHDeepNet achieved 100% sensitivity and 99.17% accuracy in classifying ADHD/HC
subjects. To clarify model explainability and identify key brain regions and
frequency bands for ADHD diagnosis, we analyzed the learned weights and
activation patterns of the model's primary layers. Additionally, t-distributed
Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) visualized high-dimensional data, aiding
in interpreting the model's decisions. This study highlights the potential of
DL and EEG in enhancing ADHD diagnosis accuracy and efficiency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统推理蒸馏方法假设存在单一最优教师模型，但实际上存在多个候选教师和不断增长的CoT语料库。研究发现不同学生有不同的"最佳教师"，甚至同一学生在不同数据集上的最佳教师也会变化。

Method: 提出Merge-of-Thought Distillation (MoT)框架，交替进行教师特定的监督微调分支和权重空间合并学生变体，以统一多个教师的推理能力并克服监督冲突。

Result: 在数学竞赛基准上，仅使用约200个高质量CoT样本，Qwen3-14B学生模型超越了DEEPSEEK-R1、QWEN3-30B-A3B等多个强大模型，性能显著提升。MoT始终优于最佳单教师蒸馏和朴素多教师联合方法。

Conclusion: MoT作为一种简单、可扩展的路径，能够有效地将多样教师的长期CoT能力蒸馏到紧凑的学生模型中，同时减少灾难性遗忘，提高数学之外的通用推理能力，甚至培养出更好的教师模型。

Abstract: Efficient reasoning distillation for long chain-of-thought (CoT) models is
increasingly constrained by the assumption of a single oracle teacher, despite
practical availability of multiple candidate teachers and growing CoT corpora.
We revisit teacher selection and observe that different students have different
"best teachers," and even for the same student the best teacher can vary across
datasets. Therefore, to unify multiple teachers' reasoning abilities into
student with overcoming conflicts among various teachers' supervision, we
propose Merge-of-Thought Distillation (MoT), a lightweight framework that
alternates between teacher-specific supervised fine-tuning branches and
weight-space merging of the resulting student variants. On competition math
benchmarks, using only about 200 high-quality CoT samples, applying MoT to a
Qwen3-14B student surpasses strong models including DEEPSEEK-R1, QWEN3-30B-A3B,
QWEN3-32B, and OPENAI-O1, demonstrating substantial gains. Besides, MoT
consistently outperforms the best single-teacher distillation and the naive
multi-teacher union, raises the performance ceiling while mitigating
overfitting, and shows robustness to distribution-shifted and peer-level
teachers. Moreover, MoT reduces catastrophic forgetting, improves general
reasoning beyond mathematics and even cultivates a better teacher, indicating
that consensus-filtered reasoning features transfer broadly. These results
position MoT as a simple, scalable route to efficiently distilling long CoT
capabilities from diverse teachers into compact students.

Abstract: Honey bee colonies are essential for global food security and ecosystem
stability, yet they face escalating threats from pests, diseases, and
environmental stressors. Traditional hive inspections are labor-intensive and
disruptive, while cloud-based monitoring solutions remain impractical for
remote or resource-limited apiaries. Recent advances in Internet of Things
(IoT) and Tiny Machine Learning (TinyML) enable low-power, real-time monitoring
directly on edge devices, offering scalable and non-invasive alternatives. This
survey synthesizes current innovations at the intersection of TinyML and
apiculture, organized around four key functional areas: monitoring hive
conditions, recognizing bee behaviors, detecting pests and diseases, and
forecasting swarming events. We further examine supporting resources, including
publicly available datasets, lightweight model architectures optimized for
embedded deployment, and benchmarking strategies tailored to field constraints.
Critical limitations such as data scarcity, generalization challenges, and
deployment barriers in off-grid environments are highlighted, alongside
emerging opportunities in ultra-efficient inference pipelines, adaptive edge
learning, and dataset standardization. By consolidating research and
engineering practices, this work provides a foundation for scalable, AI-driven,
and ecologically informed monitoring systems to support sustainable pollinator
management.

Main category: cs.AR

TL;DR: 本文分析了基于FPGA的Montgomery模乘器实现，针对BLS12-381椭圆曲线，采用粗粒度集成操作数扫描方法，比较了Verilog原生、Verilog优化和高级综合三种设计方法在性能、延迟和资源消耗方面的差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为椭圆曲线密码学操作（如点加和点乘）提供高性能、高吞吐量的硬件基础，实现每秒数百万次运算，同时通过合理使用FPGA DSP原语来优化频率和资源消耗。

Method: 采用Coarsely Integrated Operand Scanning方法处理完整部分积，使用不同数字大小。比较三种设计：Vivado自动综合的Verilog原生方法、手动实例化DSP原语的Verilog优化方法，以及完整的高级综合方法。使用AMD-Xilinx工具和Alveo FPGA板卡进行RTL-HLS混合方法分析。

Result: 分析了不同设计选择和工具配置对频率、延迟和资源消耗的影响，并与Rust编写的优化软件实现进行了性能比较。

Conclusion: 通过系统比较不同FPGA实现方法，为BLS12-381椭圆曲线的Montgomery模乘器提供了优化的硬件实现方案，展示了DSP原语在提高频率和减少资源消耗方面的优势。

Abstract: We present the analysis of various FPGA design implementations of a
Montgomery Modular Multiplier, compatible with the BLS12-381 elliptic curve,
using the Coarsely Integrated Operand Scanning approach of working with
complete partial products on different digit sizes. The scope of the
implemented designs is to achieve a high-frequency, high-throughput solution
capable of computing millions of operations per second, which can provide a
strong foundation for different Elliptic Curve Cryptography operations such as
point addition and point multiplication. One important constraint for our
designs was to only use FPGA DSP primitives for the arithmetic operations
between digits employed in the CIOS algorithm as these primitives, when
pipelined properly, can operate at a high frequency while also relaxing the
resource consumption of FPGA LUTs and FFs. The target of the analysis is to see
how different design choices and tool configurations influence the frequency,
latency and resource consumption when working with the latest AMD-Xilinx tools
and Alveo FPGA boards in an RTL-HLS hybrid approach. We compare three
categories of designs: a Verilog naive approach where we rely on the Vivado
synthesizer to automatically choose when and where to use DSPs, a Verilog
optimized approach by manually instantiating the DSP primitives ourselves and a
complete High-Level Synthesis approach. We also compare the FPGA
implementations with an optimized software implementation of the same
Montgomery multiplier written in Rust.

TL;DR: FlexiFlow是一个面向物品级智能(ILI)的生命周期感知设计框架，通过柔性电子技术实现低成本、可持续的边缘计算，在碳足迹优化方面取得显著效果


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统计算部署模式无法适应物品级智能应用1000倍的操作寿命差异，需要在万亿级部署规模下重新考虑架构设计决策，平衡体现碳足迹和操作碳足迹

Method: 开发包含FlexiBench工作负载套件、FlexiBits面积优化RISC-V核心(1/4/8位数据路径)和碳感知模型的完整框架，使用全开源工具和柔性电子PDK进行流片验证

Result: 实现了2.65-3.50倍能效提升，生命周期感知微架构设计减少碳足迹1.62倍，算法决策减少碳足迹14.5倍，达到30.9kHz操作频率

Conclusion: FlexiFlow证明了在极端边缘计算场景中，传统设计方法需要重新评估以适应新的约束条件，为可持续计算提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: We present FlexiFlow, a lifetime-aware design framework for item-level
intelligence (ILI) where computation is integrated directly into disposable
products like food packaging and medical patches. Our framework leverages
natively flexible electronics which offer significantly lower costs than
silicon but are limited to kHz speeds and several thousands of gates. Our
insight is that unlike traditional computing with more uniform deployment
patterns, ILI applications exhibit 1000X variation in operational lifetime,
fundamentally changing optimal architectural design decisions when considering
trillion-item deployment scales. To enable holistic design and optimization, we
model the trade-offs between embodied carbon footprint and operational carbon
footprint based on application-specific lifetimes. The framework includes: (1)
FlexiBench, a workload suite targeting sustainability applications from
spoilage detection to health monitoring; (2) FlexiBits, area-optimized RISC-V
cores with 1/4/8-bit datapaths achieving 2.65X to 3.50X better energy
efficiency per workload execution; and (3) a carbon-aware model that selects
optimal architectures based on deployment characteristics. We show that
lifetime-aware microarchitectural design can reduce carbon footprint by 1.62X,
while algorithmic decisions can reduce carbon footprint by 14.5X. We validate
our approach through the first tape-out using a PDK for flexible electronics
with fully open-source tools, achieving 30.9kHz operation. FlexiFlow enables
exploration of computing at the Extreme Edge where conventional design
methodologies must be reevaluated to account for new constraints and
considerations.

Main category: cs.AR

TL;DR: FASE框架是首个在FPGA平台上实现系统调用仿真的工作，通过最小化硬件接口、主机-目标协议和远程系统调用处理，使复杂多线程基准测试能够直接在处理器设计上运行，无需集成SoC或目标操作系统，实现早期性能验证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统工作流程将验证过程推迟到RTL设计和SoC集成完成后，显著延长了开发和迭代周期。AI工作负载和领域特定架构的快速发展导致处理器微架构日益多样化，需要快速准确的性能验证。

Method: FASE框架引入三个关键创新：(1)仅暴露最小CPU接口，其他硬件组件保持不变；(2)提出主机-目标协议(HTP)最小化跨设备数据流量；(3)提出主机端运行时远程处理Linux风格系统调用。

Result: 在Xilinx FPGA上的实验显示：单线程CoreMark性能误差小于1%，比Proxy Kernel效率高2000倍以上；复杂OpenMP基准测试中，大多数单线程工作负载验证准确率超过96%，多线程工作负载超过91.5%。

Conclusion: FASE框架显著降低了开发复杂性和反馈时间，所有组件均已开源发布，为早期阶段性能验证提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of AI workloads and domain-specific architectures has
led to increasingly diverse processor microarchitectures, whose design
exploration requires fast and accurate performance validation. However,
traditional workflows defer validation process until RTL design and SoC
integration are complete, significantly prolonging development and iteration
cycle.
  In this work, we present FASE framework, FPGA-Assisted Syscall Emulation, the
first work for adapt syscall emulation on FPGA platforms, enabling complex
multi-thread benchmarks to directly run on the processor design without
integrating SoC or target OS for early-stage performance validation. FASE
introduces three key innovations to address three critical challenges for
adapting FPGA-based syscall emulation: (1) only a minimal CPU interface is
exposed, with other hardware components untouched, addressing the lack of a
unified hardware interface in FPGA systems; (2) a Host-Target Protocol (HTP) is
proposed to minimize cross-device data traffic, mitigating the low-bandwidth
and high-latency communication between FPGA and host; and (3) a host-side
runtime is proposed to remotely handle Linux-style system calls, addressing the
challenge of cross-device syscall delegation.
  Experiments ware conducted on Xilinx FPGA with open-sourced RISC-V SMP
processor Rocket. With single-thread CoreMark, FASE introduces less than 1%
performance error and achieves over 2000x higher efficiency compared to Proxy
Kernel due to FPGA acceleration. With complex OpenMP benchmarks, FASE
demonstrates over 96% performance validation accuracy for most single-thread
workloads and over 91.5% for most multi-thread workloads compared to full SoC
validation, significantly reducing development complexity and time-to-feedback.
All components of FASE framework are released as open-source.

*Yan Tan,Xiangchen Meng,Zijun Jiang,Yangdi Lyu*

Main category: cs.AR

TL;DR: AutoVeriFix是一个两阶段框架，通过Python参考模型和自动化测试来提升LLM生成的Verilog代码的功能正确性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLM在硬件描述语言(如Verilog)代码生成中因训练数据稀缺导致的功能错误问题，现有方法过于关注语法正确性而忽略功能正确性

Method: 两阶段框架：第一阶段用LLM生成定义电路行为的Python参考模型，第二阶段基于Python模型创建自动化测试来指导Verilog RTL实现，通过仿真差异迭代识别和修正错误

Result: 实验结果表明该方法在提升生成Verilog代码功能正确性方面显著优于现有最先进方法

Conclusion: AutoVeriFix通过Python辅助的两阶段方法有效解决了LLM生成Verilog代码的功能正确性问题，提高了代码的可靠性和准确性

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in
generating software code for high-level programming languages such as Python
and C++. However, their application to hardware description languages, such as
Verilog, is challenging due to the scarcity of high-quality training data.
Current approaches to Verilog code generation using LLMs often focus on
syntactic correctness, resulting in code with functional errors. To address
these challenges, we present AutoVeriFix, a novel Python-assisted two-stage
framework designed to enhance the functional correctness of LLM-generated
Verilog code. In the first stage, LLMs are employed to generate high-level
Python reference models that define the intended circuit behavior. In the
second stage, these Python models facilitate the creation of automated tests
that guide the generation of Verilog RTL implementations. Simulation
discrepancies between the reference model and the Verilog code are iteratively
used to identify and correct errors, thereby improving the functional accuracy
and reliability of the LLM-generated Verilog code. Experimental results
demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms existing
state-of-the-art methods in improving the functional correctness of generated
Verilog code.

Main category: cs.AR

TL;DR: BitROM是首个基于CiROM的LLM加速器，通过1.58位量化和三项创新技术，在65nm工艺下实现20.8 TOPS/W能效和4,967 kB/mm²的比特密度，比现有数字CiROM设计提升10倍面积效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统CiROM加速器由于LLM参数量巨大而难以扩展，如LLaMA-7B在先进CMOS节点需要超过1,000 cm²的硅面积，限制了边缘设备上的实际部署。

Method: 1) 双向ROM阵列，每个晶体管存储两个三元权重；2) 三元权重计算优化的三模式本地累加器；3) 集成解码-刷新eDRAM，支持片上KV缓存管理；4) 集成LoRA适配器实现跨任务迁移学习。

Result: 在65nm CMOS工艺下实现20.8 TOPS/W能效和4,967 kB/mm²比特密度，面积效率比现有数字CiROM设计提升10倍，外部DRAM访问减少43.6%。

Conclusion: BitROM通过架构与量化模型的协同设计，成功克服了CiROM在LLM上的可扩展性限制，为边缘应用提供了实用高效的LLM推理解决方案。

Abstract: Compute-in-Read-Only-Memory (CiROM) accelerators offer outstanding energy
efficiency for CNNs by eliminating runtime weight updates. However, their
scalability to Large Language Models (LLMs) is fundamentally constrained by
their vast parameter sizes. Notably, LLaMA-7B - the smallest model in LLaMA
series - demands more than 1,000 cm2 of silicon area even in advanced CMOS
nodes. This paper presents BitROM, the first CiROM-based accelerator that
overcomes this limitation through co-design with BitNet's 1.58-bit quantization
model, enabling practical and efficient LLM inference at the edge. BitROM
introduces three key innovations: 1) a novel Bidirectional ROM Array that
stores two ternary weights per transistor; 2) a Tri-Mode Local Accumulator
optimized for ternary-weight computations; and 3) an integrated Decode-Refresh
(DR) eDRAM that supports on-die KV-cache management, significantly reducing
external memory access during decoding. In addition, BitROM integrates
LoRA-based adapters to enable efficient transfer learning across various
downstream tasks. Evaluated in 65nm CMOS, BitROM achieves 20.8 TOPS/W and a bit
density of 4,967 kB/mm2 - offering a 10x improvement in area efficiency over
prior digital CiROM designs. Moreover, the DR eDRAM contributes to a 43.6%
reduction in external DRAM access, further enhancing deployment efficiency for
LLMs in edge applications.

Motivation: 现有并行化方法在异构硬件环境中扩展效率低下，由于粗粒度和静态的并行策略无法充分利用混合高端和低端GPU的优势

Method: 采用细粒度动态并行设计：选择性并行化计算密集型操作，以头部粒度动态分配Attention计算到低端GPU，并采用在线负载调度策略平衡网络延迟、计算负载和内存强度

Result: 评估结果显示，Hetis相比现有系统可将服务吞吐量提升最高2.25倍，延迟降低1.49倍

Conclusion: Hetis通过创新的细粒度动态并行化方法有效解决了异构GPU集群中的内存和计算效率问题，显著提升了LLM服务性能

Abstract: The significant resource demands in LLM serving prompts production clusters
to fully utilize heterogeneous hardware by partitioning LLM models across a mix
of high-end and low-end GPUs. However, existing parallelization approaches
often struggle to scale efficiently in heterogeneous environments due to their
coarse-grained and static parallelization strategies.
  In this paper, we introduce Hetis, a new LLM system tailored for
heterogeneous GPU clusters. Hetis addresses two critical challenges: (1) memory
inefficiency caused by the mismatch between memory capacity and computational
power in heterogeneous devices, and (2) computational inefficiency arising from
performance gaps across different LLM modules. To tackle these issues, Hetis
employs a fine-grained and dynamic parallelism design. Specifically, it
selectively parallelizes compute-intensive operations to reduce latency and
dynamically distributes Attention computations to low-end GPUs at a head
granularity, leveraging the distinct characteristics of each module.
Additionally, Hetis features an online load dispatching policy that
continuously optimizes serving performance by carefully balancing network
latency, computational load, and memory intensity. Evaluation results
demonstrate that Hetis can improve serving throughput by up to $2.25\times$ and
reduce latency by $1.49\times$ compared to existing systems.

TL;DR: Duplex是一个联合优化网络拓扑和图形采样的统一框架，通过考虑两者的耦合关系，在降低通信成本的同时提升DFGL训练性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 去中心化联邦图学习(DFGL)虽然避免了参数服务器的瓶颈，但图节点嵌入的大量跨工作节点通信带来了显著的通信开销。现有方法单独使用稀疏网络拓扑或图邻居采样来缓解通信开销，但直接组合这些方法会导致训练性能显著下降。

Method: 提出Duplex框架，通过考虑网络拓扑和图形采样的耦合关系进行联合优化。引入学习驱动算法自适应确定最优网络拓扑和图形采样比例，以应对统计异构性和动态网络环境等实际挑战。

Result: 实验结果显示，Duplex在达到目标精度时减少了20.1%-48.8%的完成时间和16.7%-37.6%的通信成本，在相同资源预算下精度提高了3.3%-7.9%。

Conclusion: Duplex通过联合优化网络拓扑和图形采样，有效解决了DFGL中的通信效率问题，在降低通信成本的同时提升了训练性能，适用于实际的异构和动态环境。

Abstract: Decentralized Federated Graph Learning (DFGL) overcomes potential bottlenecks
of the parameter server in FGL by establishing a peer-to-peer (P2P)
communication network among workers. However, while extensive cross-worker
communication of graph node embeddings is crucial for DFGL training, it
introduces substantial communication costs. Most existing works typically
construct sparse network topologies or utilize graph neighbor sampling methods
to alleviate the communication overhead in DFGL. Intuitively, integrating these
methods may offer promise for doubly improving communication efficiency in
DFGL. However, our preliminary experiments indicate that directly combining
these methods leads to significant training performance degradation if they are
jointly optimized. To address this issue, we propose Duplex, a unified
framework that jointly optimizes network topology and graph sampling by
accounting for their coupled relationship, thereby significantly reducing
communication cost while enhancing training performance in DFGL. To overcome
practical DFGL challenges, eg, statistical heterogeneity and dynamic network
environments, Duplex introduces a learning-driven algorithm to adaptively
determine optimal network topologies and graph sampling ratios for workers.
Experimental results demonstrate that Duplex reduces completion time by
20.1%--48.8% and communication costs by 16.7%--37.6% to achieve target
accuracy, while improving accuracy by 3.3%--7.9% under identical resource
budgets compared to baselines.

Abstract: To overcome the challenges of ultra-low latency, ubiquitous coverage, and
soaring data rates, this article presents a combined use of Near Field
Communication (NFC) and Reconfigurable Holographic Surfaces (RHS) for
Non-Terrestrial Networks (NTN). A system architecture has been presented, which
shows that the integration of RHS with NTN platforms such as satellites, High
Altitute Platform Stations (HAPS), and Uncrewed Aerial Vehicles (UAV) can
achieve precise beamforming and intelligent wavefront control in near-field
regions, enhancing Energy Efficiency (EE), spectral utilization, and spatial
resolution. Moreover, key applications, challenges, and future directions have
been identified to fully adopt this integration. In addition, a use case
analysis has been presented to improve the EE of the system in a public safety
use case scenario, further strengthening the UAV-RHS fusion.

Result: 在多种硬件基准测试和内核上验证了框架有效性，特别是在稀疏矩阵向量乘积(SPMXV)内核中成功检测到不同的性能状态，并为HBM与DDR内存系统的比较评估提供了硬件选择指导。

Conclusion: 该噪声注入方法为瓶颈分析提供了精确的补充技术，能够有效识别性能限制类型并指导硬件选择，具有跨不同架构和微架构的良好可移植性。

Abstract: Bottleneck evaluation plays a crucial part in performance tuning of HPC
applications, as it directly influences the search for optimizations and the
selection of the best hardware for a given code. In this paper, we introduce a
new model-agnostic, instruction-accurate framework for bottleneck analysis
based on performance noise injection. This method provides a precise analysis
that complements existing techniques, particularly in quantifying unused
resource slack. Specifically, we classify programs based on whether they are
limited by computation, data access bandwidth, or latency by injecting
additional noise instructions that target specific bottleneck sources. Our
approach is built on the LLVM compiler toolchain, ensuring easy portability
across different architectures and microarchitectures which constitutes an
improvement over many state-of-the-art tools. We validate our framework on a
range of hardware benchmarks and kernels, including a detailedstudy of a
sparse-matrix--vector product (SPMXV) kernel, where we successfully detect
distinct performance regimes. These insights further inform hardware selection,
as demonstrated by our comparative evaluation between HBM and DDR memory
systems.

### [82] [Memshare: Memory Sharing for Multicore Computation in R with an Application to Feature Selection by Mutual Information using PDE](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08632)
*Michael C. Thrun,Julian Märte*

Main category: cs.PF

TL;DR: memshare是一个R包，通过C++共享内存和ALTREP视图实现多核共享内存计算，相比SharedObject速度提升2倍且不增加内存占用，适用于大数据分析场景。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决R语言在大数据分析中的内存限制问题，特别是在需要并行处理大规模数据集（如RNA测序数据）时，传统方法需要为每个线程分配独立内存，导致内存消耗过大。

Method: 开发memshare包，在C++中分配共享内存缓冲区，通过R的ALTREP机制暴露给R语言使用，实现多核间的内存共享。

Result: 在列式应用基准测试中，相比Bioconductor的SharedObject包，memshare获得2倍速度提升且不增加常驻内存。在RNA测序数据分析用例中（10,446个样本×19,637个基因），显著减少了内存需求。

Conclusion: memshare有效解决了R语言在大规模并行计算中的内存瓶颈问题，为生物信息学和大数据分析提供了高效的内存共享解决方案。

Abstract: We present memshare\footnote{The Software package is published as a CRAN
package under https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=memshare, a package that
enables shared memory multicore computation in R by allocating buffers in C++
shared memory and exposing them to R through ALTREP views. We compare memshare
to SharedObject (Bioconductor) discuss semantics and safety, and report a 2x
speedup over SharedObject with no additional resident memory in a column wise
apply benchmark. Finally, we illustrate a downstream analytics use case:
feature selection by mutual information in which densities are estimated per
feature via Pareto Density Estimation (PDE). The analytical use-case is an RNA
seq dataset consisting of N=10,446 cases and d=19,637 gene expressions
requiring roughly n_threads * 10GB of memory in the case of using parallel R
sessions. Such and larger use-cases are common in big data analytics and make R
feel limiting sometimes which is mitigated by the addition of the library
presented in this work.
