However, manual kernel design is\nboth costly and time-consuming, motivating automatic approaches that leverage\nLLMs for code generation. Existing methods for automatic kernel generation,\nhowever, often produce low-efficiency kernels, incur high computational\noverhead, and fail to generalize across settings.

Our workflow is inspired by the iterative workflow of human\nexperts, which contains steps such as developing initial kernels, testing\ncorrectness, analyzing hardware feedback, and iterative improvement. More\nspecifically, CudaForge employs two LLM agents: a Coder and a Judge, that\niteratively generate, correct, and optimize CUDA kernels, while integrating\nhardware feedback such as Nsight Compute (NCU) metrics. In extensive\nevaluations, we show that CudaForge, by leveraging base models like OpenAI-o3,\nachieves 97.6\\% correctness of generated kernels and an average 1.68$\\times$\nspeedup over PyTorch baselines, substantially surpassing state-of-the-art\nmodels including OpenAI-o3 and Kevin on KernelBench. Beyond accuracy and speed,\nCudaForge demonstrates strong generalization across GPUs (A100, RTX 6000, 4090,\n3090) and base models (OpenAI-o3, GPT-5, gpt-oss-120B, Claude-Sonnet-4,\nQwQ-32B), while maintaining high efficiency.

Given the high stakes of pedagogical\ndecisions, KT models are typically required to be interpretable, in the sense\nthat they should implement an explicit model of human learning and provide\nexplicit estimates of learners' abilities. However, to our knowledge, no study\nto date has investigated whether the interpretability of KT models actually\nhelps human teachers to make teaching decisions. We address this gap. First, we\nperform a simulation study to show that, indeed, decisions based on\ninterpretable KT models achieve mastery faster compared to decisions based on a\nnon-interpretable model. Second, we repeat the study but ask $N=12$ human\nteachers to make the teaching decisions based on the information provided by KT\nmodels. As expected, teachers rate interpretable KT models higher in terms of\nusability and trustworthiness. However, the number of tasks needed until\nmastery hardly differs between KT models. This suggests that the relationship\nbetween model interpretability and teacher decisions is not straightforward:\nteachers do not solely rely on KT models to make decisions and further research\nis needed to investigate how learners and teachers actually understand and use\nKT models."}

This key insight\nprovides a principled foundation for systematically porting federated\noptimization techniques to collaborative LLM inference. Building on this\nframework, we theoretically analyze how local self-attention computation within\nparticipants and heterogeneous token relevance among participants shape error\npropagation dynamics across Transformer blocks. Moreover, we characterize the\nfundamental trade-off between response quality and communication/computation\nefficiency, which is governed by the synchronization interval and the number of\nparticipants. Experimental results validate our theoretical analysis, and\nreveal significant optimization opportunities through sparse attention and\nadaptive KV aggregation, highlighting FedAttn's potential to deliver\nscalability and efficiency in real-world edge deployments."}
