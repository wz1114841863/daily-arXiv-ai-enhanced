We present Hive hash table, a\nhigh-performance, warp-cooperative and dynamically resizable GPU hash table\nthat adapts to varying workloads without global rehashing.\n  Hive hash table makes three key contributions. First, a cache-aligned packed\nbucket layout stores key-value pairs as 64-bit words, enabling coalesced memory\naccess and atomic updates via single-CAS operations. Second, warp-synchronous\nconcurrency protocols - Warp-Aggregated-Bitmask-Claim (WABC) and\nWarp-Cooperative Match-and-Elect (WCME) - reduce contention to one atomic\noperation per warp while ensuring lock-free progress. Third, a\nload-factor-aware dynamic resizing strategy expands or contracts capacity in\nwarp-parallel K-bucket batches using linear hashing, maintaining balanced\noccupancy. To handle insertions under heavy contention, Hive hash table employs\na four-step strategy: replace, claim-and-commit, bounded cuckoo eviction, and\noverflow-stash fallback. This design provides lock-free fast paths and bounded\nrecovery cost under contention determined by a fixed eviction depth, while\neliminating ABA hazards during concurrent updates.\n  Experimental evaluation on an NVIDIA RTX 4090 shows Hive hash table sustains\nload factors up to 95% while delivering 1.5-2x higher throughput than\nstate-of-the-art GPU hash tables (Slab-Hash, DyCuckoo, WarpCore) under mixed\ninsert-delete-lookup workloads. On balanced workload, Hive hash table reaches\n3.5 billion updates/s and nearly 4 billion lookups/s, demonstrating scalability\nand efficiency for GPU-accelerated data processing."}

Current parallel execution frameworks either\nrely on optimistic concurrency control (OCC) or on pessimistic concurrency\ncontrol (PCC), both of which see their performance decrease when workloads are\nhighly contended, albeit for different reasons. In this work, we present NEMO,\na new blockchain execution engine that combines OCC with the object data model\nto address this challenge. NEMO introduces four core innovations: (i) a greedy\ncommit rule for transactions using only owned objects; (ii) refined handling of\ndependencies to reduce re-executions; (iii) the use of incomplete but\nstatically derivable read/write hints to guide execution; and (iv) a\npriority-based scheduler that favors transactions that unblock others. Through\nsimulated execution experiments, we demonstrate that NEMO significantly reduces\nredundant computation and achieves higher throughput than representative\napproaches. For example, with 16 workers NEMO's throughput is up to 42% higher\nthan the one of Block-STM, the state-of-the-art OCC approach, and 61% higher\nthan the pessimistic concurrency control baseline used."}

The pay-as-you-go cost model of these cloud resources has\nnecessitated the development of specialized programming models and schedulers\nfor HPC jobs for efficient utilization of cloud resources. A key aspect of\nefficient utilization is the ability to rescale applications on the fly to\nmaximize the utilization of cloud resources. Most commonly used parallel\nprogramming models like MPI have traditionally not supported autoscaling either\nin a cloud environment or on supercomputers. While more recent work has been\ndone to implement this functionality in MPI, it is still nascent and requires\nadditional programmer effort. Charm++ is a parallel programming model that\nnatively supports dynamic rescaling through its migratable objects paradigm. In\nthis paper, we present a Kubernetes operator to run Charm++ applications on a\nKubernetes cluster. We then present a priority-based elastic job scheduler that\ncan dynamically rescale jobs based on the state of a Kubernetes cluster to\nmaximize cluster utilization while minimizing response time for high-priority\njobs.

Furthermore, we introduce a novel policy\nlearning algorithm for continuous-time LQRs that achieves global linear and\nlocal super-linear convergence. Our results demonstrate both theoretical\nguarantees and algorithmic benefits of transfer learning in continuous-time RL,\naddressing a gap in existing literature and extending prior work from discrete\nto continuous time settings.\n  As a byproduct of our analysis, we derive the stability of a class of\ncontinuous-time score-based diffusion models via their connection with LQRs."}

To investigate, we formalize reasoning as chains of Horn clauses\n(\"if-then\" rules) built from features extracted from the LLM's latent space via\ncross-layer sparse autoencoders (SAEs). We estimate the transition\nprobabilities between its features, and further categorize each rule by its\nsemantic soundness level (e.g., strict, plausible, noisy) with an LLM. Our key\ndiscovery is that high-potential models are inherently soundness-aware: their\ninternal probability distributions systematically shift across rules' soundness\nlevels, becoming highly distinct for \"strict\" versus \"noisy\" rules. In\ncontrast, weaker models are soundness-agnostic, collapsing to one distribution\nregardless of soundness levels. To quantify this, we introduce the\nSoundness-Aware Level (SAL), a microscopic metric using the Jensen-Shannon\nDivergence to measure the separation between these distributions. We show that\nSAL's predictions of post-RLVR reasoning performance follow a precise empirical\nlaw (R^2=0.87) across diverse model families (Qwen, Mistral, Llama, DeepSeek)\nand scales (0.5B-14B).

Although such proofs are mechanically verified by formal systems like\nLean, their excessive length renders them difficult for humans to comprehend\nand limits their usefulness for mathematical insight. Proof simplification is\ntherefore a critical bottleneck. Yet, training data for this task is scarce,\nand existing methods -- mainly agentic scaffolding with off-the-shelf LLMs --\nstruggle with the extremely long proofs generated by RL-trained provers. We\nintroduce ProofOptimizer, the first language model trained to simplify Lean\nproofs without requiring additional human supervision. ProofOptimizer is\ntrained via expert iteration and reinforcement learning, using Lean to verify\nsimplifications and provide training signal. At inference time, it operates\nwithin an iterative proof-shortening workflow, progressively reducing proof\nlength. Experiments show that ProofOptimizer substantially compresses proofs\ngenerated by state-of-the-art RL-trained provers on standard benchmarks,\nreducing proof length by 87% on miniF2F, 57% on PutnamBench, and 49% on\nSeed-Prover's IMO 2025 proofs. Beyond conciseness, the simplified proofs check\nfaster in Lean and further improve downstream prover performance when reused as\ntraining data for supervised finetuning."}

To this end, we\nintroduce Probabilistic Shielding via Risk Augmentation (ProSh), a model-free\nalgorithm for safe reinforcement learning under cost constraints. ProSh\naugments the Constrained MDP state space with a risk budget and enforces safety\nby applying a shield to the agent's policy distribution using a learned cost\ncritic. The shield ensures that all sampled actions remain safe in expectation.\nWe also show that optimality is preserved when the environment is\ndeterministic.
