This result is shown through a new technique,\ncalled round elimination via self-reduction. The lower bound proof is beautiful\nand presents very nice ideas.

Unlike traditional ZeRO, which employs over-fine-grained sharding\nthat can lead to inefficient communication, AsyncHZP adaptively reshards\nparameters, gradients, and optimizer states across different replica groups.\nThis strategy optimizes device memory utilization and significantly reduces\ncommunication overhead. In addition, we also design a multi-stream asynchronous\nscheduling method that executes parameter all-gather and gradient\nreduce-scatter operations in dedicated background threads, effectively\noverlapping communication with computation while incurring negligible memory\nfragmentation.

We\nrigorously analyze SiMRA's true random generation potential in terms of\nentropy, latency, and throughput for varying numbers of simultaneously\nactivated DRAM rows (i.e., 2, 4, 8, 16, and 32), data patterns, temperature\nlevels, and spatial variations. Among our 11 key experimental observations, we\nhighlight four key results. First, we evaluate the quality of our TRNG designs\nusing the commonly-used NIST statistical test suite for randomness and find\nthat all SiMRA-based TRNG designs successfully pass each test. Second, 2-, 8-,\n16-, and 32-row activation-based TRNG designs outperform the state-of-theart\nDRAM-based TRNG in throughput by up to 1.15x, 1.99x, 1.82x, and 1.39x,\nrespectively. Third, SiMRA's entropy tends to increase with the number of\nsimultaneously activated DRAM rows. Fourth, operational parameters and\nconditions (e.g., data pattern and temperature) significantly affect entropy.\nFor example, for most of the tested modules, the average entropy of 32-row\nactivation is 2.51x higher than that of 2-row activation. For example,\nincreasing the temperature from 50{\\deg}C to 90{\\deg}C decreases SiMRA's\nentropy by 1.53x for 32-row activation.

We\nempirically trace the collapse to the joint optimization of encoders and\nprototypes, which encourages a type of shortcut learning: early in training\nprototypes drift toward redundant representations that minimize loss without\nnecessarily enhancing representation diversity. To break the joint\noptimization, we introduce a fully decoupled training strategy that learns\nprototypes and encoders under separate objectives.

Existing scaling-law studies almost exclusively rely on cross-entropy\nas the evaluation metric. However, cross-entropy provides only a partial view\nof performance: it measures the absolute probability assigned to the correct\ntoken, but ignores the relative ordering between correct and incorrect tokens.\nYet, relative ordering is crucial for language models, such as in\ngreedy-sampling scenario. To address this limitation, we investigate scaling\nfrom the perspective of relative ordering. We first propose the Relative-Based\nProbability (RBP) metric, which quantifies the probability that the correct\ntoken is ranked among the top predictions. Building on this metric, we\nestablish the Relative-Based Scaling Law, which characterizes how RBP improves\nwith increasing model size. Through extensive experiments on four datasets and\nfour model families spanning five orders of magnitude, we demonstrate the\nrobustness and accuracy of this law.

We evaluate two control\nstrategies: a modular architecture with specialized agents and a monolithic\nagent governing the full system, while also analyzing the impact of action\nmasking. Our experiments show that without action masking, agents struggle to\nlearn effective policies, with the modular architecture performing better. When\naction masking is applied, both architectures improve substantially, and the\nperformance gap narrows considerably.

This, in turn, poses a challenge for\ndeep learning decoding techniques. To overcome this, we introduce MEIcoder, a\nbiologically informed decoding method that leverages neuron-specific most\nexciting inputs (MEIs), a structural similarity index measure loss, and\nadversarial training. MEIcoder achieves state-of-the-art performance in\nreconstructing visual stimuli from single-cell activity in primary visual\ncortex (V1), especially excelling on small datasets with fewer recorded\nneurons. Using ablation studies, we demonstrate that MEIs are the main drivers\nof the performance, and in scaling experiments, we show that MEIcoder can\nreconstruct high-fidelity natural-looking images from as few as 1,000-2,500\nneurons and less than 1,000 training data points. We also propose a unified\nbenchmark with over 160,000 samples to foster future research. Our results\ndemonstrate the feasibility of reliable decoding in early visual system and\nprovide practical insights for neuroscience and neuroengineering applications."}

Modern decision Transformers - trained similarly to LLMs -\nare able to learn competent gameplay, but it is unclear to what extent they\ntruly capture the rules of chess. To investigate this, we train a 270M\nparameter chess Transformer and test it on out-of-distribution scenarios,\ndesigned to reveal failures of systematic generalization. Our analysis shows\nthat Transformers exhibit compositional generalization, as evidenced by strong\nrule extrapolation: they adhere to fundamental syntactic rules of the game by\nconsistently choosing valid moves even in situations very different from the\ntraining data. Moreover, they also generate high-quality moves for OOD puzzles.\nIn a more challenging test, we evaluate the models on variants including\nChess960 (Fischer Random Chess) - a variant of chess where starting positions\nof pieces are randomized. We found that while the model exhibits basic strategy\nadaptation, they are inferior to symbolic AI algorithms that perform explicit\nsearch, but gap is smaller when playing against users on Lichess. Moreover, the\ntraining dynamics revealed that the model initially learns to move only its own\npieces, suggesting an emergent compositional understanding of the game."}

While prior work has explored\nbackdoor attacks in image diffusion and unconditional graph generation,\nconditional, especially text-guided graph generation remains largely\nunexamined. This paper proposes BadGraph, a backdoor attack method targeting\nlatent diffusion models for text-guided graph generation. BadGraph leverages\ntextual triggers to poison training data, covertly implanting backdoors that\ninduce attacker-specified subgraphs during inference when triggers appear,\nwhile preserving normal performance on clean inputs. Extensive experiments on\nfour benchmark datasets (PubChem, ChEBI-20, PCDes, MoMu) demonstrate the\neffectiveness and stealth of the attack: less than 10% poisoning rate can\nachieves 50% attack success rate, while 24% suffices for over 80% success rate,\nwith negligible performance degradation on benign samples. Ablation studies\nfurther reveal that the backdoor is implanted during VAE and diffusion training\nrather than pretraining. These findings reveal the security vulnerabilities in\nlatent diffusion models of text-guided graph generation, highlight the serious\nrisks in models' applications such as drug discovery and underscore the need\nfor robust defenses against the backdoor attack in such diffusion models."}

Yet LASER's exhaustive, per-matrix search (each\nrequiring full-dataset forward passes) makes it impractical for rapid\ndeployment. We demonstrate that this overhead can be removed and find that: (i)\nOnly a small, carefully chosen subset of matrices needs to be inspected --\neliminating the layer-by-layer sweep, (ii) The gradient of each matrix's\nsingular values pinpoints which matrices merit reduction, (iii) Increasing the\nfactorization search space by allowing matrices rows to cluster around multiple\nsubspaces and then decomposing each cluster separately further reduces\noverfitting on the original training data and further lifts accuracy by up to\n24.6 percentage points, and finally, (iv) we discover that evaluating on just\n100 samples rather than the full training data -- both for computing the\nindicative gradients and for measuring the final accuracy -- suffices to\nfurther reduce the search time; we explain that as adaptation to downstream\ntasks is dominated by prompting style, not dataset size. As a result, we show\nthat combining these findings yields a fast and robust adaptation algorithm for\ndownstream tasks. Overall, with a single gradient step on 100 examples and a\nquick scan of the top candidate layers and factorization techniques, we can\nadapt LLMs to new datasets -- entirely without fine-tuning."}

We show -- mathematically and empirically -- that this intuition does\nnot necessarily transfer well to doing reinforcement learning with\nreverse/forward KL regularization (e.g. as commonly used with language models).\nInstead, the choice of reverse/forward KL determines the family of optimal\ntarget distributions, parameterized by the regularization coefficient. Mode\ncoverage depends primarily on other factors, such as regularization strength,\nand relative scales between rewards and reference probabilities. Further, we\nshow commonly used settings such as low regularization strength and equal\nverifiable rewards tend to specify unimodal target distributions, meaning the\noptimization objective is, by construction, non-diverse. We leverage these\ninsights to construct a simple, scalable, and theoretically justified\nalgorithm. It makes minimal changes to reward magnitudes, yet optimizes for a\ntarget distribution which puts high probability over all high-quality sampling\nmodes. In experiments, this simple modification works to post-train both Large\nLanguage Models and Chemical Language Models to have higher solution quality\nand diversity, without any external signals of diversity, and works with both\nforward and reverse KL when using either naively fails."}

Mainstream approaches like ND\nparallelism are often cumbersome and complex, while flexible alternatives such\nas the Zero Redundancy Optimizer (ZeRO) are frequently hampered by\ncommunication overhead. In this paper, we propose Asynchronous Hierarchical\nZero Parallelism (AsyncHZP), a novel asynchronous variant of ZeRO designed to\nachieve superior performance while maintaining simplicity and memory\nefficiency. Unlike traditional ZeRO, which employs over-fine-grained sharding\nthat can lead to inefficient communication, AsyncHZP adaptively reshards\nparameters, gradients, and optimizer states across different replica groups.\nThis strategy optimizes device memory utilization and significantly reduces\ncommunication overhead. In addition, we also design a multi-stream asynchronous\nscheduling method that executes parameter all-gather and gradient\nreduce-scatter operations in dedicated background threads, effectively\noverlapping communication with computation while incurring negligible memory\nfragmentation. Empirical evaluations on both Dense and Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)\nmodels confirm that AsyncHZP maintains robust stability at scale. It\nconsistently outperforms classic ND parallelism, achieving state-of-the-art\nperformance without complex strategic tuning, thereby simplifying the path to\nefficient large-scale training."}
