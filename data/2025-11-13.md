### [1] [PANDA: Noise-Resilient Antagonist Identification in Production Datacenters](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08803)
*Sixiang Zhou,Nan Deng,Krzysiek Rzadca,Charlie Y. Hu,Xiaojun Lin*

Main category: cs.PF

TL;DR: PANDA是一个用于生产级数据中心的抗噪声干扰识别框架，通过利用全局历史知识和机器级CPI指标，在多重受害者场景下准确识别性能干扰源。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代数据中心通常将多个作业共置在同一机器上以提高资源利用率，但这会导致性能干扰问题。现有的干扰源检测方法要么依赖昂贵的离线分析，要么在生产环境中采样但受噪声影响且无法处理多重受害者场景。

Method: PANDA使用CPI作为性能指标，但通过(i)利用所有机器的全局历史知识来抑制采样噪声，(ii)引入机器级CPI指标来捕获多个共置任务间的共享资源竞争。

Result: 在Google生产环境trace上的评估显示，PANDA比现有方法更准确地识别真正干扰源——将平均可疑百分位从50-55%提升到82.6%，并在多重受害者场景下实现一致的干扰源识别，且运行时开销可忽略。

Conclusion: PANDA框架能够有效解决生产数据中心中的性能干扰问题，提供准确且可扩展的干扰源识别方案。

Abstract: Modern warehouse-scale datacenters commonly collocate multiple jobs on shared machines to improve resource utilization. However, such collocation often leads to performance interference caused by antagonistic jobs that overconsume shared resources. Existing antagonist-detection approaches either rely on offline profiling, which is costly and unscalable, or use a sample-from-production approach, which suffers from noisy measurements and fails under multi-victim scenarios. We present PANDA, a noise-resilient antagonist identification framework for production-scale datacenters. Like prior correlation-based methods, PANDA uses cycles per instruction (CPI) as its performance metric, but it differs by (i) leveraging global historical knowledge across all machines to suppress sampling noise and (ii) introducing a machine-level CPI metric that captures shared-resource contention among multiple co-located tasks. Evaluation on a recent Google production trace shows that PANDA ranks true antagonists far more accurately than prior methods -- improving average suspicion percentile from 50-55% to 82.6% -- and achieves consistent antagonist identification under multi-victim scenarios, all with negligible runtime overhead.

Abstract: AI systems have found a wide range of real-world applications in recent years. The adoption of edge artificial intelligence, embedding AI directly into edge devices, is rapidly growing. Despite the implementation of guardrails and safety mechanisms, security vulnerabilities and challenges have become increasingly prevalent in this domain, posing a significant barrier to the practical deployment and safety of AI systems. This paper proposes an agentic AI safety architecture that leverages 3D to integrate a dedicated safety layer. It introduces an adaptive AI safety infrastructure capable of dynamically learning and mitigating attacks against the AI system. The system leverages the inherent advantages of co-location with the edge computing hardware to continuously monitor, detect and proactively mitigate threats to the AI system. The integration of local processing and learning capabilities enhances resilience against emerging network-based attacks while simultaneously improving system reliability, modularity, and performance, all with minimal cost and 3D integration overhead.

Abstract: Simulation-based fault injection is a widely adopted methodology for assessing circuit vulnerability to Single Event Upsets (SEUs); however, its computational cost grows significantly with circuit complexity. To address this limitation, this work introduces an open-source platform that exploits Spatio-Temporal Graph Neural Networks (STGNNs) to accelerate SEU fault simulation. The platform includes three STGNN architectures incorporating advanced components such as Atrous Spatial Pyramid Pooling (ASPP) and attention mechanisms, thereby improving spatio-temporal feature extraction. In addition, SEU fault simulation datasets are constructed from six open-source circuits with varying levels of complexity, providing a comprehensive benchmark for performance evaluation. The predictive capability of the STGNN models is analyzed and compared on these datasets. Moreover, to further investigate the efficiency of the approach, we evaluate the predictive capability of STGNNs across multiple test cases and discuss their generalization capability. The developed platform and datasets are released as open-source to support reproducibility and further research on https://github.com/luli2021/FsimNNs.

### [5] [Accelerating Training Speed of Tiny Recursive Models via Curriculum Guided Adaptive Recursion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08653)
*Kaleem Ullah Qasim,Jiashu Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CGAR提出了一种新的训练方法，通过将课程学习应用于架构深度而非传统数据排序，显著提升了递归推理模型的训练效率。该方法包含渐进深度课程和分层监督加权两个组件，在Sudoku-Extreme数据集上实现了1.71倍训练加速和42%成本降低，同时准确率仅下降0.63%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 递归推理模型虽然性能优异，但训练成本高昂（约36 GPU小时/数据集），限制了其广泛采用和研究。需要开发更高效的训练方法来降低计算成本。

Method: CGAR包含两个核心组件：1）渐进深度课程：在训练过程中从浅到深动态调整递归深度；2）分层监督加权：对监督步骤应用指数衰减的重要性权重，使损失权重与观察到的梯度幅度衰减保持一致。

Result: 在Sudoku-Extreme数据集上，CGAR实现了1.71倍训练加速（从10.93小时降至6.38小时，成本降低42%），准确率仅从86.65%降至86.02%。渐进深度课程单独使用可实现2.26倍加速和85.47%准确率。

Conclusion: CGAR证明了在架构深度上应用原则性课程学习能够有效训练递归推理模型，在适度硬件上实现高效训练，同时提升推理效率（100%停止准确率和11%更少的推理步骤）。

Abstract: Recursive reasoning models achieve remarkable performance on complex reasoning tasks through iterative refinement, enabling tiny networks to match large language models thousands of times their size. However, training remains computationally expensive, prior work reporting approximately 36 GPU-hours per dataset, limiting broader adoption and research. We propose CGAR, a novel training methodology that applies curriculum learning to architectural depth rather than traditional data ordering. CGAR introduces two synergistic components: Progressive Depth Curriculum dynamically adjusts recursion depth from shallow to deep configurations during training, preventing early overfitting while reducing computational cost, and Hierarchical Supervision Weighting applies exponentially decaying importance to supervision steps, aligning loss weighting with observed gradient magnitude decay. On Sudoku-Extreme with 423,168 test puzzles, CGAR achieves 1.71x training speedup (10.93 to 6.38 hours, 42% cost reduction) with only 0.63% accuracy drop (86.65% to 86.02%). Systematic ablations reveal Progressive Depth Curriculum alone achieves 2.26x speedup with 85.47% accuracy, demonstrating a rare Pareto improvement where architectural curriculum simultaneously enhances training efficiency and solution quality. CGAR-trained models exhibit superior inference efficiency with 100% halting accuracy and 11% fewer reasoning steps. Our work demonstrates that principled curriculum on architectural depth enables efficient training of recursive reasoning models on modest hardware.

### [6] [Learning the Basis: A Kolmogorov-Arnold Network Approach Embedding Green's Function Priors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08655)
*Rui Zhu,Yuexing Peng,George C. Alexandropoulos,Wenbo Wang,Wei Xiang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文提出PhyKAN，一种基于可学习基函数的电磁建模方法，替代传统矩量法中固定的RWG基函数，实现高精度重建和无监督雷达截面预测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统矩量法受限于静态、几何定义的基函数（如RWG基），缺乏自适应性和可学习性。

Method: 提出PhyKAN，将RWG基推广为可学习的自适应基函数族，结合局部KAN分支和嵌入格林函数先验的全局分支，保持物理一致性。

Result: 在典型几何结构上，PhyKAN实现低于0.01的重建误差，并能准确进行无监督雷达截面预测。

Conclusion: PhyKAN在经典求解器和现代神经网络模型之间建立了可解释、物理一致的桥梁，为电磁建模提供了新方法。

Abstract: The Method of Moments (MoM) is constrained by the usage of static, geometry-defined basis functions, such as the Rao-Wilton-Glisson (RWG) basis. This letter reframes electromagnetic modeling around a learnable basis representation rather than solving for the coefficients over a fixed basis. We first show that the RWG basis is essentially a static and piecewise-linear realization of the Kolmogorov-Arnold representation theorem. Inspired by this insight, we propose PhyKAN, a physics-informed Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) that generalizes RWG into a learnable and adaptive basis family. Derived from the EFIE, PhyKAN integrates a local KAN branch with a global branch embedded with Green's function priors to preserve physical consistency. It is demonstrated that, across canonical geometries, PhyKAN achieves sub-0.01 reconstruction errors as well as accurate, unsupervised radar cross section predictions, offering an interpretable, physics-consistent bridge between classical solvers and modern neural network models for electromagnetic modeling.

Conclusion: TabPFN-2.5显著提升了表格AI的性能和可扩展性，通过蒸馏技术实现了生产环境的低延迟部署，将加强现有TabPFN生态系统的应用性能。

Abstract: The first tabular foundation model, TabPFN, and its successor TabPFNv2 have impacted tabular AI substantially, with dozens of methods building on it and hundreds of applications across different use cases. This report introduces TabPFN-2.5, the next generation of our tabular foundation model, built for datasets with up to 50,000 data points and 2,000 features, a 20x increase in data cells compared to TabPFNv2. TabPFN-2.5 is now the leading method for the industry standard benchmark TabArena (which contains datasets with up to 100,000 training data points), substantially outperforming tuned tree-based models and matching the accuracy of AutoGluon 1.4, a complex four-hour tuned ensemble that even includes the previous TabPFNv2. Remarkably, default TabPFN-2.5 has a 100% win rate against default XGBoost on small to medium-sized classification datasets (<=10,000 data points, 500 features) and a 87% win rate on larger datasets up to 100K samples and 2K features (85% for regression). For production use cases, we introduce a new distillation engine that converts TabPFN-2.5 into a compact MLP or tree ensemble, preserving most of its accuracy while delivering orders-of-magnitude lower latency and plug-and-play deployment. This new release will immediately strengthen the performance of the many applications and methods already built on the TabPFN ecosystem.

*Can Yang,Zhenzhong Wang,Junyuan Liu,Yunpeng Gong,Min Jiang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了PEGNet，一种物理嵌入图网络，通过将PDE动力学嵌入到图神经网络的消息传递中，实现了更稳定和物理一致的模拟。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统数值求解器计算成本高，而现有数据驱动方法存在误差累积和物理一致性不足的问题，特别是在多物理场和复杂几何中。

Method: 将PDE动力学（如对流、粘性、扩散）嵌入到不同的消息函数中，采用分层架构捕获多尺度特征，并在损失函数中加入物理正则化。

Result: 在呼吸气流和药物输送等基准测试中，相比现有方法在长期预测精度和物理一致性方面有显著提升。

Conclusion: PEGNet通过物理嵌入的消息传递机制，为PDE模拟提供了更准确和物理一致的解决方案。

Abstract: Accurate and efficient simulations of physical phenomena governed by partial differential equations (PDEs) are important for scientific and engineering progress. While traditional numerical solvers are powerful, they are often computationally expensive. Recently, data-driven methods have emerged as alternatives, but they frequently suffer from error accumulation and limited physical consistency, especially in multiphysics and complex geometries. To address these challenges, we propose PEGNet, a Physics-Embedded Graph Network that incorporates PDE-guided message passing to redesign the graph neural network architecture. By embedding key PDE dynamics like convection, viscosity, and diffusion into distinct message functions, the model naturally integrates physical constraints into its forward propagation, producing more stable and physically consistent solutions. Additionally, a hierarchical architecture is employed to capture multi-scale features, and physical regularization is integrated into the loss function to further enforce adherence to governing physics. We evaluated PEGNet on benchmarks, including custom datasets for respiratory airflow and drug delivery, showing significant improvements in long-term prediction accuracy and physical consistency over existing methods. Our code is available at https://github.com/Yanghuoshan/PEGNet.

### [9] [FAIRPLAI: A Human-in-the-Loop Approach to Fair and Private Machine Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08702)
*David Sanchez,Holly Lopez,Michelle Buraczyk,Anantaa Kotal*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FAIRPLAI是一个将人类监督集成到机器学习系统中的实用框架，通过在准确性、隐私保护和公平性之间建立透明权衡，允许决策者根据领域需求选择公平标准，并嵌入差分隐私审计循环来实现负责任的人工智能部署。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着机器学习系统在医疗、金融、招聘等关键领域应用，仅关注准确性已不足够，模型还需要兼顾公平性、隐私保护和可问责性。现有方法存在隐私保护可能加剧不公平、公平性干预依赖敏感数据、自动化流程忽视人类判断等问题。

Method: FAIRPLAI通过三个核心机制实现：(1)构建隐私-公平边界，透明展示准确性、隐私保证和群体结果之间的权衡；(2)支持交互式利益相关者输入，允许决策者选择反映领域需求的公平标准和操作点；(3)嵌入差分私有审计循环，让人类能够审查解释和边缘案例而不损害数据安全。

Result: 在基准数据集上的应用表明，FAIRPLAI在保持强大隐私保护的同时，相对于自动化基线显著减少了公平性差异，为从业者提供了管理准确性、隐私和公平性竞争需求的直接可解释流程。

Conclusion: 通过在关键位置嵌入人类判断，FAIRPLAI为构建在实践中有效、负责任且可信赖的机器学习系统提供了可行路径，解决了社会影响应用中竞争性需求的平衡问题。

Abstract: As machine learning systems move from theory to practice, they are increasingly tasked with decisions that affect healthcare access, financial opportunities, hiring, and public services. In these contexts, accuracy is only one piece of the puzzle - models must also be fair to different groups, protect individual privacy, and remain accountable to stakeholders. Achieving all three is difficult: differential privacy can unintentionally worsen disparities, fairness interventions often rely on sensitive data that privacy restricts, and automated pipelines ignore that fairness is ultimately a human and contextual judgment. We introduce FAIRPLAI (Fair and Private Learning with Active Human Influence), a practical framework that integrates human oversight into the design and deployment of machine learning systems. FAIRPLAI works in three ways: (1) it constructs privacy-fairness frontiers that make trade-offs between accuracy, privacy guarantees, and group outcomes transparent; (2) it enables interactive stakeholder input, allowing decision-makers to select fairness criteria and operating points that reflect their domain needs; and (3) it embeds a differentially private auditing loop, giving humans the ability to review explanations and edge cases without compromising individual data security. Applied to benchmark datasets, FAIRPLAI consistently preserves strong privacy protections while reducing fairness disparities relative to automated baselines. More importantly, it provides a straightforward, interpretable process for practitioners to manage competing demands of accuracy, privacy, and fairness in socially impactful applications. By embedding human judgment where it matters most, FAIRPLAI offers a pathway to machine learning systems that are effective, responsible, and trustworthy in practice.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了LLM-ABS框架来研究大语言模型代理在独裁者游戏中的行为，发现系统提示对模型行为有显著影响，模型通常表现出对公平的强烈偏好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究忽视了系统提示在塑造LLM代理行为中的关键作用，且结果对提示的微小变化非常敏感，需要建立更稳健的行为研究基线。

Method: 提出LLM-ABS框架，通过(i)探索不同系统提示对模型行为的影响，(ii)使用中性提示变体获取更可靠的代理偏好洞察，(iii)分析LLM代理对开放式指令响应的语言特征。

Result: 代理通常表现出对公平的强烈偏好，系统提示对其行为有显著影响。从语言角度看，模型以不同方式表达其响应。

Conclusion: 虽然提示敏感性仍是持续挑战，但LLM-ABS框架为LLM代理行为研究提供了稳健基础。

Abstract: In behavioral sciences, experiments such as the ultimatum game are conducted to assess preferences for fairness or self-interest of study participants. In the dictator game, a simplified version of the ultimatum game where only one of two players makes a single decision, the dictator unilaterally decides how to split a fixed sum of money between themselves and the other player. Although recent studies have explored behavioral patterns of AI agents based on Large Language Models (LLMs) instructed to adopt different personas, we question the robustness of these results. In particular, many of these studies overlook the role of the system prompt - the underlying instructions that shape the model's behavior - and do not account for how sensitive results can be to slight changes in prompts. However, a robust baseline is essential when studying highly complex behavioral aspects of LLMs. To overcome previous limitations, we propose the LLM agent behavior study (LLM-ABS) framework to (i) explore how different system prompts influence model behavior, (ii) get more reliable insights into agent preferences by using neutral prompt variations, and (iii) analyze linguistic features in responses to open-ended instructions by LLM agents to better understand the reasoning behind their behavior. We found that agents often exhibit a strong preference for fairness, as well as a significant impact of the system prompt on their behavior. From a linguistic perspective, we identify that models express their responses differently. Although prompt sensitivity remains a persistent challenge, our proposed framework demonstrates a robust foundation for LLM agent behavior studies.

*Hiro Ishii,Kenta Niwa,Hiroshi Sawada,Akinori Fujino,Noboru Harada,Rio Yokota*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FedPM是一种新颖的联邦学习方法，通过服务器端的预条件混合来缓解本地预条件器漂移问题，在异构数据设置下显著提升收敛性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的二阶优化联邦学习方法（如LocalNewton、LTDA、FedSophia）在客户端执行迭代本地更新并在服务器端简单混合参数，但在异构数据设置下容易产生本地预条件器漂移，严重影响参数训练的收敛性。

Method: 通过将理想二阶更新（使用全局预条件的全局梯度计算）分解为服务器端的参数混合和客户端的本地参数更新，在服务器端引入预条件混合机制来有效缓解本地预条件器漂移。

Result: 理论分析表明在强凸目标和单次本地更新场景下具有超线性收敛速率。实验结果显示FedPM在测试准确率上相比传统简单混合方法有显著提升，充分发挥了二阶优化的潜力。

Conclusion: FedPM通过预条件混合机制有效解决了联邦学习中二阶优化的预条件器漂移问题，在理论和实验上都表现出优越性能。

Abstract: We propose Federated Preconditioned Mixing (FedPM), a novel Federated Learning (FL) method that leverages second-order optimization. Prior methods--such as LocalNewton, LTDA, and FedSophia--have incorporated second-order optimization in FL by performing iterative local updates on clients and applying simple mixing of local parameters on the server. However, these methods often suffer from drift in local preconditioners, which significantly disrupts the convergence of parameter training, particularly in heterogeneous data settings. To overcome this issue, we refine the update rules by decomposing the ideal second-order update--computed using globally preconditioned global gradients--into parameter mixing on the server and local parameter updates on clients. As a result, our FedPM introduces preconditioned mixing of local parameters on the server, effectively mitigating drift in local preconditioners.
  We provide a theoretical convergence analysis demonstrating a superlinear rate for strongly convex objectives in scenarios involving a single local update. To demonstrate the practical benefits of FedPM, we conducted extensive experiments. The results showed significant improvements with FedPM in the test accuracy compared to conventional methods incorporating simple mixing, fully leveraging the potential of second-order optimization.

TL;DR: 本研究首次在美国大规模应用机器学习方法预测网络级排放率与交通流量的关系，基于探针车辆数据构建数据驱动的宏观排放基础图(eMFD)，揭示其对网络、基础设施、土地利用和车辆特征的区位依赖性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 城市拥堵导致车辆运行效率低下，加剧温室气体排放和空气污染。宏观排放基础图(eMFD)能捕捉网络层面排放与聚合交通变量之间的有序关系，但由于历史数据限制，经验推导的eMFD模型较为稀疏。

Method: 利用探针车辆获取的大规模精细化交通和排放数据，应用机器学习方法预测网络级排放率与交通流量的关系。

Result: 开发了数据分析框架和洞察，生成了数据驱动的eMFD，并深入理解了其对网络、基础设施、土地利用和车辆特征的区位依赖性。

Conclusion: 该研究使交通管理部门能够测量给定出行需求下的城市交通碳排放，并优化特定区位的交通管理和规划决策，以减轻网络级排放。

Abstract: Urban congestions cause inefficient movement of vehicles and exacerbate greenhouse gas emissions and urban air pollution. Macroscopic emission fundamental diagram (eMFD)captures an orderly relationship among emission and aggregated traffic variables at the network level, allowing for real-time monitoring of region-wide emissions and optimal allocation of travel demand to existing networks, reducing urban congestion and associated emissions. However, empirically derived eMFD models are sparse due to historical data limitation. Leveraging a large-scale and granular traffic and emission data derived from probe vehicles, this study is the first to apply machine learning methods to predict the network wide emission rate to traffic relationship in U.S. urban areas at a large scale. The analysis framework and insights developed in this work generate data-driven eMFDs and a deeper understanding of their location dependence on network, infrastructure, land use, and vehicle characteristics, enabling transportation authorities to measure carbon emissions from urban transport of given travel demand and optimize location specific traffic management and planning decisions to mitigate network-wide emissions.

Motivation: 研究图粗化问题，旨在在Gromov-Wasserstein几何框架下开发有效的图结构简化方法，以处理大规模图数据。

Method: 提出两种算法：GPC（贪婪对粗化）迭代合并最小化局部失真的节点对；KGPC（k均值贪婪对粗化）基于成对失真度量的聚类直接合并节点簇。

Result: 在六个大规模数据集和下游聚类任务中验证，所提方法在广泛参数和场景下优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 基于Gromov-Wasserstein几何的图粗化方法有效，GPC和KGPC算法在保持图结构特征的同时实现了高质量的粗化效果。

Abstract: We study the problem of graph coarsening within the Gromov-Wasserstein geometry. Specifically, we propose two algorithms that leverage a novel representation of the distortion induced by merging pairs of nodes. The first method, termed Greedy Pair Coarsening (GPC), iteratively merges pairs of nodes that locally minimize a measure of distortion until the desired size is achieved. The second method, termed $k$-means Greedy Pair Coarsening (KGPC), leverages clustering based on pairwise distortion metrics to directly merge clusters of nodes. We provide conditions guaranteeing optimal coarsening for our methods and validate their performance on six large-scale datasets and a downstream clustering task. Results show that the proposed methods outperform existing approaches on a wide range of parameters and scenarios.

Result: 成功扩展了VSA编码，使其能够表示图灵完备的语法结构，提高了神经网络状态的表达性和可解释性。

Conclusion: 这种结构化表示编码方法在机器学习任务中具有潜在应用价值，对于设计对表示结构敏感的网络行为、开发更通用的智能体具有重要意义。

Abstract: Using Frequency-domain Holographic Reduced Representations (FHRRs), we extend a Vector-Symbolic Architecture (VSA) encoding of Lisp 1.5 with primitives for arithmetic operations using Residue Hyperdimensional Computing (RHC). Encoding a Turing-complete syntax over a high-dimensional vector space increases the expressivity of neural network states, enabling network states to contain arbitrarily structured representations that are inherently interpretable. We discuss the potential applications of the VSA encoding in machine learning tasks, as well as the importance of encoding structured representations and designing neural networks whose behavior is sensitive to the structure of their representations in virtue of attaining more general intelligent agents than exist at present.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 偏差-方差分解是统计学和机器学习的核心结果，但通常只针对平方误差。作者希望为Bregman散度下的分解提供一个清晰的教学推导。

Method: 作者提供了一个独立的、清晰的数学推导过程，将经典的偏差-方差分解推广到Bregman散度框架下。

Result: 成功推导出了Bregman散度下的偏差-方差分解公式，为指数族最大似然估计提供了理论支持。

Abstract: The bias-variance decomposition is a central result in statistics and machine learning, but is typically presented only for the squared error. We present a generalization of the bias-variance decomposition where the prediction error is a Bregman divergence, which is relevant to maximum likelihood estimation with exponential families. While the result is already known, there was not previously a clear, standalone derivation, so we provide one for pedagogical purposes. A version of this note previously appeared on the author's personal website without context. Here we provide additional discussion and references to the relevant prior literature.

*Ismail Lamaakal,Chaymae Yahyati,Yassine Maleh,Khalid El Makkaoui,Ibrahim Ouahbi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: BayesQ是一个基于贝叶斯后验期望损失的量化框架，通过拟合权重的高斯后验、白化处理、码本设计和混合精度分配，在3.0/3.5/4.0比特下显著优于GPTQ等基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有量化方法通常基于点估计，忽略了权重不确定性对量化性能的影响。BayesQ首次在量化中考虑后验期望损失，将低比特量化重新定义为不确定性感知的风险最小化问题。

Method: 1) 拟合权重的轻量高斯后验（默认对角Laplace）；2) 基于后验协方差进行白化；3) 设计最小化后验期望失真的码本；4) 使用贪心背包算法分配混合精度；5) 可选校准蒸馏对齐量化模型与后验预测教师。

Result: 在ResNet-50（ImageNet）和BERT-base（GLUE）上，平均比特3.0/3.5/4.0时，相比GPTQ分别提升+1.5/+0.7/+0.3 top-1百分比点和+1.1/+0.4/+0.2 GLUE点，预处理成本与GPTQ相当。

Conclusion: BayesQ将低比特量化重新定义为实用的后训练管道中的不确定性感知风险最小化，在保持高效性的同时显著提升了量化性能。

Abstract: We present BayesQ, an uncertainty-guided post-training quantization framework that is the first to optimize quantization under the posterior expected loss. BayesQ fits a lightweight Gaussian posterior over weights (diagonal Laplace by default; optional K-FAC/low-rank), whitens by the posterior covariance, designs codebooks to minimize posterior-expected distortion, and allocates mixed precision via a greedy knapsack that maximizes marginal expected-loss reduction per bit under a global budget. For scalar quantizers, posterior-expected MSE yields closed-form tables; task-aware proxies are handled by short Monte Carlo on a small calibration set. An optional calibration-only distillation aligns the quantized model with the posterior predictive teacher. At matched average bits/weight of 3.0/3.5/4.0, BayesQ improves over strong PTQ baselines on ResNet-50 (ImageNet) and BERT-base (GLUE) e.g., vs. GPTQ by $+1.5/+0.7/+0.3$ top-1 percentage points on RN50 and $+1.1/+0.4/+0.2$ GLUE points on BERT, while requiring one-time preprocessing comparable to a GPTQ pass. BayesQ reframes low-bit quantization as uncertainty-aware risk minimization in a practical, post-training pipeline.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于物理信息机器学习的方法LyapInf，从系统轨迹数据推断Lyapunov函数来估计稳定性区域，无需系统控制方程的显式知识。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在复杂动态系统设计和运行中，确保状态轨迹收敛到期望平衡点至关重要。然而对于许多实际系统（特别是航空航天领域），稳定性区域无法先验确定且难以计算。现有方法通常依赖系统控制方程的显式知识。

Method: 提出LyapInf方法：假设未知Lyapunov函数为二次型，通过最小化Zubov方程的平均残差来拟合未知二次算子到系统轨迹数据，将动态系统视为黑箱处理。

Result: 数值结果表明，该方法成功表征了与推断Lyapunov函数相关的系统稳定性区域的近最大椭球体，无需系统控制方程知识。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种无需系统控制方程显式知识的稳定性分析新途径，能够有效估计动态系统的稳定性区域。

Abstract: In the design and operation of complex dynamical systems, it is essential to ensure that all state trajectories of the dynamical system converge to a desired equilibrium within a guaranteed stability region. Yet, for many practical systems -- especially in aerospace -- this region cannot be determined a priori and is often challenging to compute. One of the most common methods for computing the stability region is to identify a Lyapunov function. A Lyapunov function is a positive function whose time derivative along system trajectories is non-positive, which provides a sufficient condition for stability and characterizes an estimated stability region. However, existing methods of characterizing a stability region via a Lyapunov function often rely on explicit knowledge of the system governing equations. In this work, we present a new physics-informed machine learning method of characterizing an estimated stability region by inferring a Lyapunov function from system trajectory data that treats the dynamical system as a black box and does not require explicit knowledge of the system governing equations. In our presented Lyapunov function Inference method (LyapInf), we propose a quadratic form for the unknown Lyapunov function and fit the unknown quadratic operator to system trajectory data by minimizing the average residual of the Zubov equation, a first-order partial differential equation whose solution yields a Lyapunov function. The inferred quadratic Lyapunov function can then characterize an ellipsoidal estimate of the stability region. Numerical results on benchmark examples demonstrate that our physics-informed stability analysis method successfully characterizes a near-maximal ellipsoid of the system stability region associated with the inferred Lyapunov function without requiring knowledge of the system governing equations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MARL方法依赖静态或逐步关系图，忽略了智能体间交互的时序演化特性，而捕捉这种动态依赖关系对于实现鲁棒和自适应的协调至关重要。

Method: 构建MARL智能体的动态时序图，连接当前和历史交互，使用时序注意力编码器聚合结构和时序邻域信息，生成时间感知的智能体嵌入来指导协作策略学习。

Result: 在两个协调密集型基准测试中，TIGER在任务性能和样本效率方面持续优于多种基于价值分解和图结构的MARL基线方法。

Conclusion: 结构和时序因素可以共同塑造MARL中有效的策略学习，TIGER通过显式建模时序演化关系显著提升了多智能体协调能力。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose capturing and utilizing \textit{Temporal Information through Graph-based Embeddings and Representations} or \textbf{TIGER} to enhance multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL). We explicitly model how inter-agent coordination structures evolve over time. While most MARL approaches rely on static or per-step relational graphs, they overlook the temporal evolution of interactions that naturally arise as agents adapt, move, or reorganize cooperation strategies. Capturing such evolving dependencies is key to achieving robust and adaptive coordination. To this end, TIGER constructs dynamic temporal graphs of MARL agents, connecting their current and historical interactions. It then employs a temporal attention-based encoder to aggregate information across these structural and temporal neighborhoods, yielding time-aware agent embeddings that guide cooperative policy learning. Through extensive experiments on two coordination-intensive benchmarks, we show that TIGER consistently outperforms diverse value-decomposition and graph-based MARL baselines in task performance and sample efficiency. Furthermore, we conduct comprehensive ablation studies to isolate the impact of key design parameters in TIGER, revealing how structural and temporal factors can jointly shape effective policy learning in MARL.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出DP-PMLF方法，通过结合逐样本动量和低通滤波策略，同时减轻差分隐私噪声和裁剪偏差，提升隐私-效用权衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的差分隐私随机梯度下降方法在添加隐私保护时往往导致模型精度下降，因为同时引入了噪声和偏差。现有技术通常只能解决其中一个问题，而减少DP噪声会加剧裁剪偏差，反之亦然。

Method: DP-PMLF方法结合逐样本动量和低通滤波策略：使用逐样本动量在裁剪前平滑梯度估计以减少采样方差；采用后处理低通滤波器衰减高频DP噪声且不消耗额外隐私预算。

Result: 理论分析显示在严格DP保证下具有改进的收敛速率；实证评估表明DP-PMLF相比多个最先进的DPSGD变体显著提升了隐私-效用权衡。

Conclusion: DP-PMLF通过同时解决噪声和偏差问题，有效改善了差分隐私深度学习训练的性能，为隐私保护机器学习提供了更优的解决方案。

Abstract: Differentially Private Stochastic Gradient Descent (DPSGD) is widely used to train deep neural networks with formal privacy guarantees. However, the addition of differential privacy (DP) often degrades model accuracy by introducing both noise and bias. Existing techniques typically address only one of these issues, as reducing DP noise can exacerbate clipping bias and vice-versa. In this paper, we propose a novel method, \emph{DP-PMLF}, which integrates per-sample momentum with a low-pass filtering strategy to simultaneously mitigate DP noise and clipping bias. Our approach uses per-sample momentum to smooth gradient estimates prior to clipping, thereby reducing sampling variance. It further employs a post-processing low-pass filter to attenuate high-frequency DP noise without consuming additional privacy budget. We provide a theoretical analysis demonstrating an improved convergence rate under rigorous DP guarantees, and our empirical evaluations reveal that DP-PMLF significantly enhances the privacy-utility trade-off compared to several state-of-the-art DPSGD variants.

TL;DR: 本文研究了在图乘积上构建拓扑描述符（欧拉特征数和持续同调）的方法，建立了颜色基滤过表达能力理论，证明了持续同调在图乘积中比单个图包含更多信息，并提供了计算算法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 拓扑描述符在关系数据中用于捕获多尺度结构信息，但现有方法在图乘积上的表达能力有限，需要开发更强大的图持续描述符。

Method: 使用图乘积上的各种滤过方法，包括颜色基滤过，开发了计算顶点和边级滤过持续同调图的算法。

Result: 理论分析表明持续同调在图乘积中比单个图包含更多信息，而欧拉特征数则不能。实证研究验证了运行时间、表达能力和图分类性能。

Conclusion: 该工作通过乘积滤过为强大的图持续描述符铺平了道路，代码已开源。

Abstract: Topological descriptors have been increasingly utilized for capturing multiscale structural information in relational data. In this work, we consider various filtrations on the (box) product of graphs and the effect on their outputs on the topological descriptors - the Euler characteristic (EC) and persistent homology (PH). In particular, we establish a complete characterization of the expressive power of EC on general color-based filtrations. We also show that the PH descriptors of (virtual) graph products contain strictly more information than the computation on individual graphs, whereas EC does not. Additionally, we provide algorithms to compute the PH diagrams of the product of vertex- and edge-level filtrations on the graph product. We also substantiate our theoretical analysis with empirical investigations on runtime analysis, expressivity, and graph classification performance. Overall, this work paves way for powerful graph persistent descriptors via product filtrations. Code is available at https://github.com/Aalto-QuML/tda_graph_product.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了两种GNN无关的图超分辨率框架：Bi-SR通过二分图连接低分辨率和高分辨率节点实现结构感知的节点超分辨率，DEFEND通过将高分辨率边映射到对偶图节点来学习边表示。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的图超分辨率方法存在两个关键限制：基于矩阵的节点超分辨率忽略了图结构且缺乏排列不变性；依赖节点表示推断边权重限制了可扩展性和表达能力。

Method: Bi-SR框架使用二分图连接LR和HR节点，保持拓扑和排列不变性；DEFEND框架通过将HR边映射到对偶图节点，使用标准节点GNN进行边推断。

Result: 在真实脑连接组数据集上，两个框架在七个拓扑度量上达到最先进性能；还引入了12个模拟数据集用于全面基准测试。

Conclusion: 提出的两种GNN无关框架有效解决了现有图超分辨率方法的局限性，在保持结构感知和可扩展性的同时实现了优异的性能。

Abstract: Graph super-resolution, the task of inferring high-resolution (HR) graphs from low-resolution (LR) counterparts, is an underexplored yet crucial research direction that circumvents the need for costly data acquisition. This makes it especially desirable for resource-constrained fields such as the medical domain. While recent GNN-based approaches show promise, they suffer from two key limitations: (1) matrix-based node super-resolution that disregards graph structure and lacks permutation invariance; and (2) reliance on node representations to infer edge weights, which limits scalability and expressivity. In this work, we propose two GNN-agnostic frameworks to address these issues. First, Bi-SR introduces a bipartite graph connecting LR and HR nodes to enable structure-aware node super-resolution that preserves topology and permutation invariance. Second, DEFEND learns edge representations by mapping HR edges to nodes of a dual graph, allowing edge inference via standard node-based GNNs. We evaluate both frameworks on a real-world brain connectome dataset, where they achieve state-of-the-art performance across seven topological measures. To support generalization, we introduce twelve new simulated datasets that capture diverse topologies and LR-HR relationships. These enable comprehensive benchmarking of graph super-resolution methods.

Conclusion: 这是将SPD扩展到现代模型的第一步，展示了该方法可用于发现可解释的参数空间机制

Abstract: Recent work in mechanistic interpretability has shown that decomposing models in parameter space may yield clean handles for analysis and intervention. Previous methods have demonstrated successful applications on a wide range of toy models, but the gap to "real models" has not yet been bridged. In this work, we extend Stochastic Parameter Decomposition (SPD) to Transformer models, proposing an updated causal importance function suited for sequential data and a new loss function. We demonstrate that SPD can successfully decompose a toy induction-head model and recover the expected 2-step circuit. We also show that applying SPD to GPT-2-small can successfully locate subcomponents corresponding to interpretable concepts like "golf" and "basketball". These results take the first step in the direction of extending SPD to modern models, and show that we can use the method to surface interpretable parameter-space mechanisms.

Motivation: 传统SWE预测方法未能充分利用时空相关性，也不提供不确定性估计，而这对水资源管理决策者具有重要价值。

Result: 在美国西部512个SNOTEL站点数据上的评估显示，在预测准确性和预测区间方面相比现有方法有显著改进。

Conclusion: 该模型为水资源管理社区提供了一个部署和反馈平台，突显了不同方法在不确定性估计方面的有效性。

Abstract: Various complex water management decisions are made in snow-dominant watersheds with the knowledge of Snow-Water Equivalent (SWE) -- a key measure widely used to estimate the water content of a snowpack. However, forecasting SWE is challenging because SWE is influenced by various factors including topography and an array of environmental conditions, and has therefore been observed to be spatio-temporally variable. Classical approaches to SWE forecasting have not adequately utilized these spatial/temporal correlations, nor do they provide uncertainty estimates -- which can be of significant value to the decision maker. In this paper, we present ForeSWE, a new probabilistic spatio-temporal forecasting model that integrates deep learning and classical probabilistic techniques. The resulting model features a combination of an attention mechanism to integrate spatiotemporal features and interactions, alongside a Gaussian process module that provides principled quantification of prediction uncertainty. We evaluate the model on data from 512 Snow Telemetry (SNOTEL) stations in the Western US. The results show significant improvements in both forecasting accuracy and prediction interval compared to existing approaches. The results also serve to highlight the efficacy in uncertainty estimates between different approaches. Collectively, these findings have provided a platform for deployment and feedback by the water management community.

TL;DR: EEG-X是一个用于EEG分析的设备无关且抗噪声的基础模型，通过位置通道嵌入和噪声感知重构策略解决EEG数据跨设备差异和低信噪比问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决EEG分析中的两个关键挑战：(1)不同记录设备和配置导致的数据集间变异性，(2)EEG信号的低信噪比，其中脑信号常被伪迹和非脑源淹没。

Method: 引入位置通道嵌入编码空间信息；采用噪声感知掩码重构策略，在原始和潜在空间中重构去噪信号；提出字典启发的卷积变换层，在计算重构损失前将信号投影到结构化特征空间。

Result: 在来自不同设备的数据集上，EEG-X在多个下游EEG任务中优于最先进方法，在电极布局不同的跨域设置中表现优异。

Conclusion: EEG-X通过设备无关和噪声鲁棒的设计，为EEG表示学习提供了一个有效的基础模型，显著提升了跨设备和跨任务的泛化能力。

Abstract: Foundation models for EEG analysis are still in their infancy, limited by two key challenges: (1) variability across datasets caused by differences in recording devices and configurations, and (2) the low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of EEG, where brain signals are often buried under artifacts and non-brain sources. To address these challenges, we present EEG-X, a device-agnostic and noise-robust foundation model for EEG representation learning. EEG-X introduces a novel location-based channel embedding that encodes spatial information and improves generalization across domains and tasks by allowing the model to handle varying channel numbers, combinations, and recording lengths. To enhance robustness against noise, EEG-X employs a noise-aware masking and reconstruction strategy in both raw and latent spaces. Unlike previous models that mask and reconstruct raw noisy EEG signals, EEG-X is trained to reconstruct denoised signals obtained through an artifact removal process, ensuring that the learned representations focus on neural activity rather than noise. To further enhance reconstruction-based pretraining, EEG-X introduces a dictionary-inspired convolutional transformation (DiCT) layer that projects signals into a structured feature space before computing reconstruction (MSE) loss, reducing noise sensitivity and capturing frequency- and shape-aware similarities. Experiments on datasets collected from diverse devices show that EEG-X outperforms state-of-the-art methods across multiple downstream EEG tasks and excels in cross-domain settings where pre-trained and downstream datasets differ in electrode layouts.

<details>

Motivation: 传统手动睡眠分期耗时且存在评分者间差异，现有深度学习模型主要依赖原始PSG信号，忽略了人类专家使用的上下文线索

Method: 使用两阶段架构：Transformer-based每时段编码器 + 1D CNN聚合器，系统性地融合患者临床元数据（年龄、性别、BMI）和专家事件标注（呼吸暂停、血氧下降、觉醒、周期性呼吸）

Result: 在SHHS队列（n=8,357）中，上下文融合显著提升分期准确性：从仅PSG的基线（macro-F1 0.7745, micro-F1 0.8774）提升至最终模型（macro-F1 0.8031, micro-F1 0.9051），事件标注贡献最大增益

Conclusion: 通过融合临床有意义特征增强学习表示，可在不修改PSG导联或增加传感器的情况下，同时提升性能和可解释性，为构建上下文感知、专家对齐的睡眠分期系统提供了实用且可扩展的路径

Abstract: Manual sleep staging from polysomnography (PSG) is labor-intensive and prone to inter-scorer variability. While recent deep learning models have advanced automated staging, most rely solely on raw PSG signals and neglect contextual cues used by human experts. We propose a two-stage architecture that combines a Transformer-based per-epoch encoder with a 1D CNN aggregator, and systematically investigates the effect of incorporating explicit context: subject-level clinical metadata (age, sex, BMI) and per-epoch expert event annotations (apneas, desaturations, arousals, periodic breathing). Using the Sleep Heart Health Study (SHHS) cohort (n=8,357), we demonstrate that contextual fusion substantially improves staging accuracy. Compared to a PSG-only baseline (macro-F1 0.7745, micro-F1 0.8774), our final model achieves macro-F1 0.8031 and micro-F1 0.9051, with event annotations contributing the largest gains. Notably, feature fusion outperforms multi-task alternatives that predict the same auxiliary labels. These results highlight that augmenting learned representations with clinically meaningful features enhances both performance and interpretability, without modifying the PSG montage or requiring additional sensors. Our findings support a practical and scalable path toward context-aware, expert-aligned sleep staging systems.

TL;DR: 提出了Covariance Scattering Transforms (CSTs)，一种无需训练的深度网络，通过应用协方差谱中的局部化滤波器来生成层次化表示，在低数据量情况下比PCA更稳定，性能与更复杂的学习模型相当或更好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统PCA方法存在两个主要问题：无法捕捉低方差方向的信息（当数据包含高方差噪声时很重要），以及在低样本量情况下结果不稳定（特别是当协方差特征值接近时）。VNNs虽然改进了稳定性但需要训练且依赖标签数据。

Method: 提出CSTs，使用协方差矩阵作为图，顺序应用协方差谱中的局部化滤波器（定义为协方差小波），通过非线性激活函数生成表达性层次表示。通过剪枝机制提高计算和内存效率。

Result: 在4个神经退行性疾病患者皮层厚度测量的年龄预测实验中，CSTs在低数据量情况下产生稳定表示，无需训练即可达到与VNNs相当的效果，预测性能与更复杂学习模型相当或更好。

Conclusion: CSTs结合了PCA和VNNs的优点，无需训练即可在低数据量情况下提供稳定且表达性强的表示，对协方差估计误差的敏感性低于PCA，特别适用于协方差特征值接近的情况。

Abstract: Machine learning and data processing techniques relying on covariance information are widespread as they identify meaningful patterns in unsupervised and unlabeled settings. As a prominent example, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) projects data points onto the eigenvectors of their covariance matrix, capturing the directions of maximum variance. This mapping, however, falls short in two directions: it fails to capture information in low-variance directions, relevant when, e.g., the data contains high-variance noise; and it provides unstable results in low-sample regimes, especially when covariance eigenvalues are close. CoVariance Neural Networks (VNNs), i.e., graph neural networks using the covariance matrix as a graph, show improved stability to estimation errors and learn more expressive functions in the covariance spectrum than PCA, but require training and operate in a labeled setup. To get the benefits of both worlds, we propose Covariance Scattering Transforms (CSTs), deep untrained networks that sequentially apply filters localized in the covariance spectrum to the input data and produce expressive hierarchical representations via nonlinearities. We define the filters as covariance wavelets that capture specific and detailed covariance spectral patterns. We improve CSTs' computational and memory efficiency via a pruning mechanism, and we prove that their error due to finite-sample covariance estimations is less sensitive to close covariance eigenvalues compared to PCA, improving their stability. Our experiments on age prediction from cortical thickness measurements on 4 datasets collecting patients with neurodegenerative diseases show that CSTs produce stable representations in low-data settings, as VNNs but without any training, and lead to comparable or better predictions w.r.t. more complex learning models.

Motivation: 解决实际部署中模型选择的两难问题：全面验证多个模型计算成本过高，但选择错误模型会导致性能不佳。

Method: 使用频谱可预测性Ω作为指标，在四个不同领域进行控制实验，并在GIFT-Eval基准的51个模型和28个数据集上扩展分析。

Result: 发现当Ω高时，大型时序基础模型系统性地优于轻量级任务训练基线；当Ω低时，其优势消失。Ω计算仅需几秒，能有效指导模型选择。

Conclusion: Ω可预测地分层模型性能，提供实用的初步筛选工具，减少验证成本，同时强调需要开发在真正困难（低Ω）问题上表现优异的模型。

Abstract: Practitioners deploying time series forecasting models face a dilemma: exhaustively validating dozens of models is computationally prohibitive, yet choosing the wrong model risks poor performance. We show that spectral predictability~$Ω$ -- a simple signal processing metric -- systematically stratifies model family performance, enabling fast model selection. We conduct controlled experiments in four different domains, then further expand our analysis to 51 models and 28 datasets from the GIFT-Eval benchmark. We find that large time series foundation models (TSFMs) systematically outperform lightweight task-trained baselines when $Ω$ is high, while their advantage vanishes as $Ω$ drops. Computing $Ω$ takes seconds per dataset, enabling practitioners to quickly assess whether their data suits TSFM approaches or whether simpler, cheaper models suffice. We demonstrate that $Ω$ stratifies model performance predictably, offering a practical first-pass filter that reduces validation costs while highlighting the need for models that excel on genuinely difficult (low-$Ω$) problems rather than merely optimizing easy ones.

Abstract: Stroke is an acute cerebrovascular disease, and timely diagnosis significantly improves patient survival. However, existing automated diagnosis methods suffer from fairness issues across demographic groups, potentially exacerbating healthcare disparities. In this work we propose FAST-CAD, a theoretically grounded framework that combines domain-adversarial training (DAT) with group distributionally robust optimization (Group-DRO) for fair and accurate non-contact stroke diagnosis. Our approach is built on domain adaptation and minimax fairness theory and provides convergence guarantees and fairness bounds. We curate a multimodal dataset covering 12 demographic subgroups defined by age, gender, and posture. FAST-CAD employs self-supervised encoders with adversarial domain discrimination to learn demographic-invariant representations, while Group-DRO optimizes worst-group risk to ensure robust performance across all subgroups. Extensive experiments show that our method achieves superior diagnostic performance while maintaining fairness across demographic groups, and our theoretical analysis supports the effectiveness of the unified DAT + Group-DRO framework. This work provides both practical advances and theoretical insights for fair medical AI systems.

Conclusion: Weaver通过创新的注意力分解和高效消息传递机制，在保持竞争力的预测性能的同时显著提高了计算效率，为交通网络时空预测提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Spatiotemporal forecasting on transportation networks is a complex task that requires understanding how traffic nodes interact within a dynamic, evolving system dictated by traffic flow dynamics and social behavioral patterns. The importance of transportation networks and ITS for modern mobility and commerce necessitates forecasting models that are not only accurate but also interpretable, efficient, and robust under structural or temporal perturbations. Recent approaches, particularly Transformer-based architectures, have improved predictive performance but often at the cost of high computational overhead and diminished architectural interpretability. In this work, we introduce Weaver, a novel attention-based model that applies Kronecker product approximations (KPA) to decompose the PN X PN spatiotemporal attention of O(P^2N^2) complexity into local P X P temporal and N X N spatial attention maps. This Kronecker attention map enables our Parallel-Kronecker Matrix-Vector product (P2-KMV) for efficient spatiotemporal message passing with O(P^2N + N^2P) complexity. To capture real-world traffic dynamics, we address the importance of negative edges in modeling traffic behavior by introducing Valence Attention using the continuous Tanimoto coefficient (CTC), which provides properties conducive to precise latent graph generation and training stability. To fully utilize the model's learning capacity, we introduce the Traffic Phase Dictionary for self-conditioning. Evaluations on PEMS-BAY and METR-LA show that Weaver achieves competitive performance across model categories while training more efficiently.

Conclusion: DIVO在离线强化学习中实现了保守性与探索性的关键平衡，通过价值条件优化机制有效提升了策略性能。

Abstract: In offline reinforcement learning, value overestimation caused by out-of-distribution (OOD) actions significantly limits policy performance. Recently, diffusion models have been leveraged for their strong distribution-matching capabilities, enforcing conservatism through behavior policy constraints. However, existing methods often apply indiscriminate regularization to redundant actions in low-quality datasets, resulting in excessive conservatism and an imbalance between the expressiveness and efficiency of diffusion modeling. To address these issues, we propose DIffusion policies with Value-conditional Optimization (DIVO), a novel approach that leverages diffusion models to generate high-quality, broadly covered in-distribution state-action samples while facilitating efficient policy improvement. Specifically, DIVO introduces a binary-weighted mechanism that utilizes the advantage values of actions in the offline dataset to guide diffusion model training. This enables a more precise alignment with the dataset's distribution while selectively expanding the boundaries of high-advantage actions. During policy improvement, DIVO dynamically filters high-return-potential actions from the diffusion model, effectively guiding the learned policy toward better performance. This approach achieves a critical balance between conservatism and explorability in offline RL. We evaluate DIVO on the D4RL benchmark and compare it against state-of-the-art baselines. Empirical results demonstrate that DIVO achieves superior performance, delivering significant improvements in average returns across locomotion tasks and outperforming existing methods in the challenging AntMaze domain, where sparse rewards pose a major difficulty.

Abstract: Hyperparameter optimization (HPO) for neural networks on tabular data is critical to a wide range of applications, yet it remains challenging due to large, non-convex search spaces and the cost of exhaustive tuning. We introduce the Quantum-Inspired Bilevel Optimizer for Neural Networks (QIBONN), a bilevel framework that encodes feature selection, architectural hyperparameters, and regularization in a unified qubit-based representation. By combining deterministic quantum-inspired rotations with stochastic qubit mutations guided by a global attractor, QIBONN balances exploration and exploitation under a fixed evaluation budget. We conduct systematic experiments under single-qubit bit-flip noise (0.1\%--1\%) emulated by an IBM-Q backend. Results on 13 real-world datasets indicate that QIBONN is competitive with established methods, including classical tree-based methods and both classical/quantum-inspired HPO algorithms under the same tuning budget.

Conclusion: 该方法通过准确重构TAC值，显著提高了后门神经元识别的精度，在各种场景下都优于现有的防御方法。

Abstract: Backdoor attacks pose a critical threat to machine learning models, causing them to behave normally on clean data but misclassify poisoned data into a poisoned class. Existing defenses often attempt to identify and remove backdoor neurons based on Trigger-Activated Changes (TAC) which is the activation differences between clean and poisoned data. These methods suffer from low precision in identifying true backdoor neurons due to inaccurate estimation of TAC values. In this work, we propose a novel backdoor removal method by accurately reconstructing TAC values in the latent representation. Specifically, we formulate the minimal perturbation that forces clean data to be classified into a specific class as a convex quadratic optimization problem, whose optimal solution serves as a surrogate for TAC. We then identify the poisoned class by detecting statistically small $L^2$ norms of perturbations and leverage the perturbation of the poisoned class in fine-tuning to remove backdoors. Experiments on CIFAR-10, GTSRB, and TinyImageNet demonstrated that our approach consistently achieves superior backdoor suppression with high clean accuracy across different attack types, datasets, and architectures, outperforming existing defense methods.

Motivation: 尽管扩散模型已成为生成模型的新SOTA，但传统变分自编码器和生成对抗网络的改进研究已停滞。本文旨在探索条件变分自编码器在图像生成中的应用，特别是解决VAE生成图像模糊和多样性不足的问题。

Method: 1. 将高斯解码器的方差作为可学习参数进行训练；2. 使用归一化流来估计潜在空间在给定标签下的条件分布，而不是假设其等于先验分布；3. 构建改进的条件变分自编码器模型。

Result: 与现有方法相比，该方法将FID（弗雷歇起始距离）降低了5%，并将对数似然提高了7.7%，表明在图像生成质量方面取得了显著改进。

Conclusion: 通过将解码器方差参数化和使用归一化流来准确建模条件分布，可以显著提升条件变分自编码器的图像生成性能，使其在生成质量和多样性方面优于传统方法。

Abstract: Variational Autoencoders and Generative Adversarial Networks remained the state-of-the-art (SOTA) generative models until 2022. Now they are superseded by diffusion based models. Efforts to improve traditional models have stagnated as a result. In old-school fashion, we explore image generation with conditional Variational Autoencoders (CVAE) to incorporate desired attributes within the images. VAEs are known to produce blurry images with less diversity, we refer a method that solve this issue by leveraging the variance of the gaussian decoder as a learnable parameter during training. Previous works on CVAEs assumed that the conditional distribution of the latent space given the labels is equal to the prior distribution, which is not the case in reality. We show that estimating it using normalizing flows results in better image generation than existing methods by reducing the FID by 5% and increasing log likelihood by 7.7% than the previous case.

Conclusion: 该方法证实了其在可靠下游决策制定中的有效性，为MoE模型提供了实用的不确定性估计解决方案。

Abstract: We present Bayesian Mixture of Experts (Bayesian-MoE), a post-hoc uncertainty estimation framework for fine-tuned large language models (LLMs) based on Mixture-of-Experts architectures. Our method applies a structured Laplace approximation to the second linear layer of each expert, enabling calibrated uncertainty estimation without modifying the original training procedure or introducing new parameters. Unlike prior approaches, which apply Bayesian inference to added adapter modules, Bayesian-MoE directly targets the expert pathways already present in MoE models, leveraging their modular design for tractable block-wise posterior estimation. We use Kronecker-factored low-rank approximations to model curvature and derive scalable estimates of predictive uncertainty and marginal likelihood. Experiments on common-sense reasoning benchmarks with Qwen1.5-MoE and DeepSeek-MoE demonstrate that Bayesian-MoE improves both expected calibration error (ECE) and negative log-likelihood (NLL) over baselines, confirming its effectiveness for reliable downstream decision-making.

Result: 在语言建模和图像分类任务中，SSR实现了更快的训练速度、更高的准确率和更强的输入损坏鲁棒性。

Conclusion: SSR通过轻量级最优传输路由有效平衡专家利用，提升SMoE性能，无需复杂辅助机制。

Abstract: Sparse Mixture-of-Experts (SMoE) has gained prominence as a scalable and computationally efficient architecture, enabling significant growth in model capacity without incurring additional inference costs. However, existing SMoE models often rely on auxiliary losses (e.g., z-loss, load balancing) and additional trainable parameters (e.g., noisy gating) to encourage expert diversity, leading to objective misalignment and increased model complexity. Moreover, existing Sinkhorn-based methods suffer from significant training overhead due to their heavy reliance on the computationally expensive Sinkhorn algorithm. In this work, we formulate token-to-expert assignment as an optimal transport problem, incorporating constraints to ensure balanced expert utilization. We demonstrate that introducing a minimal degree of optimal transport-based routing enhances SMoE performance without requiring auxiliary balancing losses. Unlike previous methods, our approach derives gating scores directly from the transport map, enabling more effective token-to-expert balancing, supported by both theoretical analysis and empirical results. Building on these insights, we propose Selective Sinkhorn Routing (SSR), a routing mechanism that replaces auxiliary loss with lightweight Sinkhorn-based routing. SSR promotes balanced token assignments while preserving flexibility in expert selection. Across both language modeling and image classification tasks, SSR achieves faster training, higher accuracy, and greater robustness to input corruption.

Abstract: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are indispensable for establishing the clinical value of medical artificial-intelligence (AI) tools, yet their high cost and long timelines hinder timely validation as new models emerge rapidly. Here, we propose BRIDGE, a data-reuse RCT design for AI-based risk models. AI risk models support a broad range of interventions, including screening, treatment selection, and clinical alerts. BRIDGE trials recycle participant-level data from completed trials of AI models when legacy and updated models make concordant predictions, thereby reducing the enrollment requirement for subsequent trials. We provide a practical checklist for investigators to assess whether reusing data from previous trials allows for valid causal inference and preserves type I error. Using real-world datasets across breast cancer, cardiovascular disease, and sepsis, we demonstrate concordance between successive AI models, with up to 64.8% overlap in top 5% high-risk cohorts. We then simulate a series of breast cancer screening studies, where our design reduced required enrollment by 46.6%--saving over US$2.8 million--while maintaining 80% power. By transforming trials into adaptive, modular studies, our proposed design makes Level I evidence generation feasible for every model iteration, thereby accelerating cost-effective translation of AI into routine care.

Abstract: We introduce a novel, efficient framework for clustering data on high-dimensional, non-Euclidean manifolds that overcomes the computational challenges associated with standard intrinsic methods. The key innovation is the use of the $p$-Fréchet map $F^p : \mathcal{M} \to \mathbb{R}^\ell$ -- defined on a generic metric space $\mathcal{M}$ -- which embeds the manifold data into a lower-dimensional Euclidean space $\mathbb{R}^\ell$ using a set of reference points $\{r_i\}_{i=1}^\ell$, $r_i \in \mathcal{M}$. Once embedded, we can efficiently and accurately apply standard Euclidean clustering techniques such as k-means. We rigorously analyze the mathematical properties of $F^p$ in the Euclidean space and the challenging manifold of $n \times n$ symmetric positive definite matrices $\mathit{SPD}(n)$. Extensive numerical experiments using synthetic and real $\mathit{SPD}(n)$ data demonstrate significant performance gains: our method reduces runtime by up to two orders of magnitude compared to intrinsic manifold-based approaches, all while maintaining high clustering accuracy, including scenarios where existing alternative methods struggle or fail.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have impressive data fusion and reasoning capabilities for autonomous driving (AD). However, training LLMs for AD faces significant challenges including high computation transmission costs, and privacy concerns associated with sensitive driving data. Federated Learning (FL) is promising for enabling autonomous vehicles (AVs) to collaboratively train models without sharing raw data. We present Federated LLM-based Autonomous Driving (FLAD), an FL framework that leverages distributed multimodal sensory data across AVs in heterogeneous environment. FLAD has three key innovations: (1) a cloud-edge-vehicle collaborative architecture that reduces communication delay and preserving data privacy; (2) an intelligent parallelized collaborative training with a communication scheduling mechanism that optimizes training efficiency, leveraging end-devices otherwise having insufficient resources for model training; and (3) a knowledge distillation method that personalizes LLM according to heterogeneous edge data. In addition, we prototype FLAD in a testbed with NVIDIA Jetsons, overcoming practical implementation challenges including CPU/GPU memory sharing in resource-constrained devices, dynamic model partitions, and fault-tolerant training.Extensive experimental evaluation demonstrates that FLAD achieves superior end-to-end AD performance while efficiently utilizing distributed vehicular resources, opening up new possibilities for future collaborative AD model training and knowledge sharing.

Conclusion: FedSDWC通过因果推理方法有效提升了联邦学习的泛化能力，理论上推导了其泛化误差界，并首次建立了与客户端先验分布的关系。

Abstract: Amid growing demands for data privacy and advances in computational infrastructure, federated learning (FL) has emerged as a prominent distributed learning paradigm. Nevertheless, differences in data distribution (such as covariate and semantic shifts) severely affect its reliability in real-world deployments. To address this issue, we propose FedSDWC, a causal inference method that integrates both invariant and variant features. FedSDWC infers causal semantic representations by modeling the weak causal influence between invariant and variant features, effectively overcoming the limitations of existing invariant learning methods in accurately capturing invariant features and directly constructing causal representations. This approach significantly enhances FL's ability to generalize and detect OOD data. Theoretically, we derive FedSDWC's generalization error bound under specific conditions and, for the first time, establish its relationship with client prior distributions. Moreover, extensive experiments conducted on multiple benchmark datasets validate the superior performance of FedSDWC in handling covariate and semantic shifts. For example, FedSDWC outperforms FedICON, the next best baseline, by an average of 3.04% on CIFAR-10 and 8.11% on CIFAR-100.

Conclusion: FairM2S是心理健康AI中公平且可扩展的少样本压力检测的最先进方法，同时发布了SAVSD数据集支持公平性研究。

Abstract: Fairness in AI-driven stress detection is critical for equitable mental healthcare, yet existing models frequently exhibit gender bias, particularly in data-scarce scenarios. To address this, we propose FairM2S, a fairness-aware meta-learning framework for stress detection leveraging audio-visual data. FairM2S integrates Equalized Odds constraints during both meta-training and adaptation phases, employing adversarial gradient masking and fairness-constrained meta-updates to effectively mitigate bias. Evaluated against five state-of-the-art baselines, FairM2S achieves 78.1% accuracy while reducing the Equal Opportunity to 0.06, demonstrating substantial fairness gains. We also release SAVSD, a smartphone-captured dataset with gender annotations, designed to support fairness research in low-resource, real-world contexts. Together, these contributions position FairM2S as a state-of-the-art approach for equitable and scalable few-shot stress detection in mental health AI. We release our dataset and FairM2S publicly with this paper.

TL;DR: 本文提出GeoGNN，一种在文本属性图上进行流形感知聚合的图神经网络，通过测地线聚合机制解决传统线性聚合导致的语义漂移问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Conclusion: 流形感知聚合在文本属性图学习中具有重要性，GeoGNN为处理语义流形上的图学习问题提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) on text--attributed graphs (TAGs) typically encode node texts using pretrained language models (PLMs) and propagate these embeddings through linear neighborhood aggregation. However, the representation spaces of modern PLMs are highly non--linear and geometrically structured, where textual embeddings reside on curved semantic manifolds rather than flat Euclidean spaces. Linear aggregation on such manifolds inevitably distorts geometry and causes semantic drift--a phenomenon where aggregated representations deviate from the intrinsic manifold, losing semantic fidelity and expressive power. To quantitatively investigate this problem, this work introduces a local PCA--based metric that measures the degree of semantic drift and provides the first quantitative framework to analyze how different aggregation mechanisms affect manifold structure. Building upon these insights, we propose Geodesic Aggregation, a manifold--aware mechanism that aggregates neighbor information along geodesics via log--exp mappings on the unit sphere, ensuring that representations remain faithful to the semantic manifold during message passing. We further develop GeoGNN, a practical instantiation that integrates spherical attention with manifold interpolation. Extensive experiments across four benchmark datasets and multiple text encoders show that GeoGNN substantially mitigates semantic drift and consistently outperforms strong baselines, establishing the importance of manifold--aware aggregation in text--attributed graph learning.

Motivation: 现有对决赌博机算法在人类反馈稀疏时效率低下，而依赖参数化奖励模型的方法容易因模型假设错误而失效。本文探索反馈增强的替代方案来改进模型无关框架。

Method: 引入增强置信边界来整合增强的人类反馈，并在广义集中性条件下进行分析，通过遗憾分析评估多因素性能权衡。

Result: 原型算法在多个交互式偏好获取基准测试中（包括推荐系统、多目标优化和大语言模型响应优化）表现出有竞争力的性能。

Conclusion: 该方法为更广泛应用中可证明高效的交互式偏好获取提供了潜力，展示了模型无关方法在稀疏反馈场景下的有效性。

Abstract: Interactive preference elicitation (IPE) aims to substantially reduce human effort while acquiring human preferences in wide personalization systems. Dueling bandit (DB) algorithms enable optimal decision-making in IPE building on pairwise comparisons. However, they remain inefficient when human feedback is sparse. Existing methods address sparsity by heavily relying on parametric reward models, whose rigid assumptions are vulnerable to misspecification. In contrast, we explore an alternative perspective based on feedback augmentation, and introduce critical improvements to the model-free DB framework. Specifically, we introduce augmented confidence bounds to integrate augmented human feedback under generalized concentration properties, and analyze the multi-factored performance trade-off via regret analysis. Our prototype algorithm achieves competitive performance across several IPE benchmarks, including recommendation, multi-objective optimization, and response optimization for large language models, demonstrating the potential of our approach for provably efficient IPE in broader applications.

Motivation: PINNs使用的软约束虽然提供了训练灵活性，但允许发现解违反物理定律，需要保证积分量的守恒性。

Result: PINN-Proj将守恒误差降低了3-4个数量级，PDE求解误差略有降低，并改善了损失景观的条件数。

Conclusion: 该方法为在PINNs中保证任何可处理积分量守恒提供了一个通用框架。

Abstract: We propose a novel projection method that guarantees the conservation of integral quantities in Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs). While the soft constraint that PINNs use to enforce the structure of partial differential equations (PDEs) enables necessary flexibility during training, it also permits the discovered solution to violate physical laws. To address this, we introduce a projection method that guarantees the conservation of the linear and quadratic integrals, both separately and jointly. We derived the projection formulae by solving constrained non-linear optimization problems and found that our PINN modified with the projection, which we call PINN-Proj, reduced the error in the conservation of these quantities by three to four orders of magnitude compared to the soft constraint and marginally reduced the PDE solution error. We also found evidence that the projection improved convergence through improving the conditioning of the loss landscape. Our method holds promise as a general framework to guarantee the conservation of any integral quantity in a PINN if a tractable solution exists.

Conclusion: 该方法通过可学习的类别关系显著增强了聚类算法的拟合能力，并能无缝扩展到包含数值和分类属性的混合数据集。

Abstract: Categorical attributes with qualitative values are ubiquitous in cluster analysis of real datasets. Unlike the Euclidean distance of numerical attributes, the categorical attributes lack well-defined relationships of their possible values (also called categories interchangeably), which hampers the exploration of compact categorical data clusters. Although most attempts are made for developing appropriate distance metrics, they typically assume a fixed topological relationship between categories when learning distance metrics, which limits their adaptability to varying cluster structures and often leads to suboptimal clustering performance. This paper, therefore, breaks the intrinsic relationship tie of attribute categories and learns customized distance metrics suitable for flexibly and accurately revealing various cluster distributions. As a result, the fitting ability of the clustering algorithm is significantly enhanced, benefiting from the learnable category relationships. Moreover, the learned category relationships are proved to be Euclidean distance metric-compatible, enabling a seamless extension to mixed datasets that include both numerical and categorical attributes. Comparative experiments on 12 real benchmark datasets with significance tests show the superior clustering accuracy of the proposed method with an average ranking of 1.25, which is significantly higher than the 5.21 ranking of the current best-performing method.

Conclusion: HCL方法在实践弱监督场景中验证了有效性，平衡了标注质量和人工成本。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs), with their powerful content generation capabilities, have been successfully applied to data annotation processes. However, the VLM-generated labels exhibit dual limitations: low quality (i.e., label noise) and absence of error correction mechanisms. To enhance label quality, we propose Human-Corrected Labels (HCLs), a novel setting that efficient human correction for VLM-generated noisy labels. As shown in Figure 1(b), HCL strategically deploys human correction only for instances with VLM discrepancies, achieving both higher-quality annotations and reduced labor costs. Specifically, we theoretically derive a risk-consistent estimator that incorporates both human-corrected labels and VLM predictions to train classifiers. Besides, we further propose a conditional probability method to estimate the label distribution using a combination of VLM outputs and model predictions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves superior classification performance and is robust to label noise, validating the effectiveness of HCL in practical weak supervision scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型稀疏矩阵的LU分解会产生填充元素，增加内存使用和计算时间。虽然通过矩阵重排序可以减少填充元素，但找到最优排列是NP难问题，现有方法缺乏理论保证。

Method: 使用图编码器预测行列节点得分，通过重参数化技术从节点得分获得置换矩阵，将矩阵重排序后计算三角因子，用ADMM和近端梯度下降优化l1范数目标函数。

Result: 在SuiteSparse基准测试中，与最先进基线相比，填充元素数量和LU分解时间分别减少了20%和17.8%。

Conclusion: 该方法通过直接优化填充元素数量的近似目标，在矩阵重排序任务中取得了显著改进。

Abstract: Fill-ins are new nonzero elements in the summation of the upper and lower triangular factors generated during LU factorization. For large sparse matrices, they will increase the memory usage and computational time, and be reduced through proper row or column arrangement, namely matrix reordering. Finding a row or column permutation with the minimal fill-ins is NP-hard, and surrogate objectives are designed to derive fill-in reduction permutations or learn a reordering function. However, there is no theoretical guarantee between the golden criterion and these surrogate objectives. Here we propose to learn a reordering network by minimizing \(l_1\) norm of triangular factors of the reordered matrix to approximate the exact number of fill-ins. The reordering network utilizes a graph encoder to predict row or column node scores. For inference, it is easy and fast to derive the permutation from sorting algorithms for matrices. For gradient based optimization, there is a large gap between the predicted node scores and resultant triangular factors in the optimization objective. To bridge the gap, we first design two reparameterization techniques to obtain the permutation matrix from node scores. The matrix is reordered by multiplying the permutation matrix. Then we introduce the factorization process into the objective function to arrive at target triangular factors. The overall objective function is optimized with the alternating direction method of multipliers and proximal gradient descent. Experimental results on benchmark sparse matrix collection SuiteSparse show the fill-in number and LU factorization time reduction of our proposed method is 20% and 17.8% compared with state-of-the-art baselines.

Conclusion: 这些发现揭示了RLHF/DPO流程中的基本脆弱性，并提供了评估其对低成本投毒攻击鲁棒性的工具。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in real-world systems, making it critical to understand their vulnerabilities. While data poisoning attacks during RLHF/DPO alignment have been studied empirically, their theoretical foundations remain unclear. We investigate the minimum-cost poisoning attack required to steer an LLM's policy toward an attacker's target by flipping preference labels during RLHF/DPO, without altering the compared outputs. We formulate this as a convex optimization problem with linear constraints, deriving lower and upper bounds on the minimum attack cost. As a byproduct of this theoretical analysis, we show that any existing label-flipping attack can be post-processed via our proposed method to reduce the number of label flips required while preserving the intended poisoning effect. Empirical results demonstrate that this cost-minimization post-processing can significantly reduce poisoning costs over baselines, particularly when the reward model's feature dimension is small relative to the dataset size. These findings highlight fundamental vulnerabilities in RLHF/DPO pipelines and provide tools to evaluate their robustness against low-cost poisoning attacks.

Abstract: Recent advances in deep reinforcement learning for autonomous cyber defence have resulted in agents that can successfully defend simulated computer networks against cyber-attacks. However, many of these agents would need retraining to defend networks with differing topology or size, making them poorly suited to real-world networks where topology and size can vary over time. In this research we introduce a novel set of Topological Extensions for Reinforcement Learning Agents (TERLA) that provide generalisability for the defence of networks with differing topology and size, without the need for retraining. Our approach involves the use of heterogeneous graph neural network layers to produce a fixed-size latent embedding representing the observed network state. This representation learning stage is coupled with a reduced, fixed-size, semantically meaningful and interpretable action space. We apply TERLA to a standard deep reinforcement learning Proximal Policy Optimisation (PPO) agent model, and to reduce the sim-to-real gap, conduct our research using Cyber Autonomy Gym for Experimentation (CAGE) Challenge 4. This Cyber Operations Research Gym environment has many of the features of a real-world network, such as realistic Intrusion Detection System (IDS) events and multiple agents defending network segments of differing topology and size. TERLA agents retain the defensive performance of vanilla PPO agents whilst showing improved action efficiency. Generalisability has been demonstrated by showing that all TERLA agents have the same network-agnostic neural network architecture, and by deploying a single TERLA agent multiple times to defend network segments with differing topology and size, showing improved defensive performance and efficiency.

Abstract: Class imbalance has been extensively studied in single-view scenarios; however, addressing this challenge in multi-view contexts remains an open problem, with even scarcer research focusing on trustworthy solutions. In this paper, we tackle a particularly challenging class imbalance problem in multi-view scenarios: long-tailed classification. We propose TMLC, a Trusted Multi-view Long-tailed Classification framework, which makes contributions on two critical aspects: opinion aggregation and pseudo-data generation. Specifically, inspired by Social Identity Theory, we design a group consensus opinion aggregation mechanism that guides decision making toward the direction favored by the majority of the group. In terms of pseudo-data generation, we introduce a novel distance metric to adapt SMOTE for multi-view scenarios and develop an uncertainty-guided data generation module that produces high-quality pseudo-data, effectively mitigating the adverse effects of class imbalance. Extensive experiments on long-tailed multi-view datasets demonstrate that our model is capable of achieving superior performance. The code is released at https://github.com/cncq-tang/TMLC.

Conclusion: 提出的链式框架能够有效估计全局期望极值边界，并提供局部不确定性量化，在理论和实验上都表现出优越性能。

Abstract: Gaussian process regression (GPR) is a popular nonparametric Bayesian method that provides predictive uncertainty estimates and is widely used in safety-critical applications. While prior research has introduced various uncertainty bounds, most existing approaches require access to specific input features and rely on posterior mean and variance estimates or tuning hyperparameters. These limitations hinder robustness and fail to capture the model's global behavior in expectation. To address these limitations, we propose a chaining-based framework for estimating upper and lower bounds on the expected extreme values over unseen data, without requiring access to specific input locations. We provide kernel-specific refinements for commonly used kernels such as RBF and Matérn, in which our bounds are tighter than generic constructions. We further improve numerical tightness by avoiding analytical relaxations. In addition to global estimation, we also develop a novel method for local uncertainty quantification at specified inputs. This approach leverages chaining geometry through partition diameters, adapting to local structure without relying on posterior variance scaling. Our experimental results validate the theoretical findings and demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches on both synthetic and real-world datasets.

Conclusion: 这项工作作为完全潜在空间智能体间通信的可行性研究，结果突显了其潜力，为未来研究提供了有价值的见解。

Abstract: While natural language is the de facto communication medium for LLM-based agents, it presents a fundamental constraint. The process of downsampling rich, internal latent states into discrete tokens inherently limits the depth and nuance of information that can be transmitted, thereby hindering collaborative problem-solving. Inspired by human mind-reading, we propose Interlat (Inter-agent Latent Space Communication), a paradigm that leverages the last hidden states of an LLM as a representation of its mind for direct transmission (termed latent communication). An additional compression process further compresses latent communication via entirely latent space reasoning. Experiments demonstrate that Interlat outperforms both fine-tuned chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting and single-agent baselines, promoting more exploratory behavior and enabling genuine utilization of latent information. Further compression not only substantially accelerates inference but also maintains competitive performance through an efficient information-preserving mechanism. We position this work as a feasibility study of entirely latent space inter-agent communication, and our results highlight its potential, offering valuable insights for future research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有无监督特征选择方法通常单独评估特征，但信息信号往往来自相关特征组。虽然一些方法尝试捕捉组结构，但通常依赖预定义分区或标签监督，限制了适用性。

Method: GroupFS是一个完全可微分框架，在特征图和样本图上强制执行拉普拉斯平滑，并应用组稀疏正则化器来学习紧凑的结构化表示。

Result: 在九个基准测试中（包括图像、表格数据和生物数据集），GroupFS在聚类任务中始终优于最先进的无监督特征选择方法，并选择出与有意义模式对齐的特征组。

Conclusion: GroupFS能够有效发现和选择有意义的特征组，在无监督特征选择任务中表现优异，且不依赖预定义分组或监督信息。

Abstract: Unsupervised feature selection (FS) is essential for high-dimensional learning tasks where labels are not available. It helps reduce noise, improve generalization, and enhance interpretability. However, most existing unsupervised FS methods evaluate features in isolation, even though informative signals often emerge from groups of related features. For example, adjacent pixels, functionally connected brain regions, or correlated financial indicators tend to act together, making independent evaluation suboptimal. Although some methods attempt to capture group structure, they typically rely on predefined partitions or label supervision, limiting their applicability. We propose GroupFS, an end-to-end, fully differentiable framework that jointly discovers latent feature groups and selects the most informative groups among them, without relying on fixed a priori groups or label supervision. GroupFS enforces Laplacian smoothness on both feature and sample graphs and applies a group sparsity regularizer to learn a compact, structured representation. Across nine benchmarks spanning images, tabular data, and biological datasets, GroupFS consistently outperforms state-of-the-art unsupervised FS in clustering and selects groups of features that align with meaningful patterns.

Conclusion: 为构建紧凑记忆开辟了新方向，未来也可用于深度持续学习。

Abstract: Despite recent progress, continual learning still does not match the performance of batch training. To avoid catastrophic forgetting, we need to build compact memory of essential past knowledge, but no clear solution has yet emerged, even for shallow neural networks with just one or two layers. In this paper, we present a new method to build compact memory for logistic regression. Our method is based on a result by Khan and Swaroop [2021] who show the existence of optimal memory for such models. We formulate the search for the optimal memory as Hessian-matching and propose a probabilistic PCA method to estimate them. Our approach can drastically improve accuracy compared to Experience Replay. For instance, on Split-ImageNet, we get 60% accuracy compared to 30% obtained by replay with memory-size equivalent to 0.3% of the data size. Increasing the memory size to 2% further boosts the accuracy to 74%, closing the gap to the batch accuracy of 77.6% on this task. Our work opens a new direction for building compact memory that can also be useful in the future for continual deep learning.

Abstract: Cross-domain shifts present a significant challenge for decision transformer (DT) policies. Existing cross-domain policy adaptation methods typically rely on a single simple filtering criterion to select source trajectory fragments and stitch them together. They match either state structure or action feasibility. However, the selected fragments still have poor stitchability: state structures can misalign, the return-to-go (RTG) becomes incomparable when the reward or horizon changes, and actions may jump at trajectory junctions. As a result, RTG tokens lose continuity, which compromises DT's inference ability. To tackle these challenges, we propose Data Fusion-Enhanced Decision Transformer (DFDT), a compact pipeline that restores stitchability. Particularly, DFDT fuses scarce target data with selectively trusted source fragments via a two-level data filter, maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) mismatch for state-structure alignment, and optimal transport (OT) deviation for action feasibility. It then trains on a feasibility-weighted fusion distribution. Furthermore, DFDT replaces RTG tokens with advantage-conditioned tokens, which improves the continuity of the semantics in the token sequence. It also applies a $Q$-guided regularizer to suppress junction value and action jumps. Theoretically, we provide bounds that tie state value and policy performance gaps to the MMD-mismatch and OT-deviation measures, and show that the bounds tighten as these two measures shrink. We show that DFDT improves return and stability over strong offline RL and sequence-model baselines across gravity, kinematic, and morphology shifts on D4RL-style control tasks, and further corroborate these gains with token-stitching and sequence-semantics stability analyses.

### [57] [FSampler: Training Free Acceleration of Diffusion Sampling via Epsilon Extrapolation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09180)
*Michael A. Vladimir*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FSampler是一种无需训练、与采样器无关的执行层，通过减少函数评估次数来加速扩散采样，使用有限差分预测器预测去噪信号，可节省15-50%的模型调用时间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型采样过程需要大量函数评估，计算成本高昂。FSampler旨在减少模型调用次数，加速采样过程，同时保持高保真度。

Method: FSampler维护最近去噪信号的历史记录，使用二阶、三阶或四阶有限差分预测器外推下一个去噪信号，在选定步骤用预测值替代模型调用，同时保持采样器更新规则不变。包含学习稳定器、梯度估计稳定器、保护窗口和周期性锚点等机制。

Result: 在FLUX.1 dev、Qwen Image和Wan 2.2等模型上，FSampler减少时间8-22%，模型调用15-25%，保持高保真度（SSIM 0.95-0.99）。在激进模式下可减少45-50%模型调用，但保真度较低（SSIM 0.73-0.74）。

Conclusion: FSampler提供了一种有效的扩散采样加速方法，无需修改采样器公式，兼容多种采样器，在保持高质量的同时显著减少计算成本。

Abstract: FSampler is a training free, sampler agnostic execution layer that accelerates diffusion sampling by reducing the number of function evaluations (NFE). FSampler maintains a short history of denoising signals (epsilon) from recent real model calls and extrapolates the next epsilon using finite difference predictors at second order, third order, or fourth order, falling back to lower order when history is insufficient. On selected steps the predicted epsilon substitutes the model call while keeping each sampler's update rule unchanged. Predicted epsilons are validated for finiteness and magnitude; a learning stabilizer rescales predictions on skipped steps to correct drift, and an optional gradient estimation stabilizer compensates local curvature. Protected windows, periodic anchors, and a cap on consecutive skips bound deviation over the trajectory. Operating at the sampler level, FSampler integrates with Euler/DDIM, DPM++ 2M/2S, LMS/AB2, and RES family exponential multistep methods and drops into standard workflows. FLUX.1 dev, Qwen Image, and Wan 2.2, FSampler reduces time by 8 to 22% and model calls by 15 to 25% at high fidelity (Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) 0.95 to 0.99), without altering sampler formulas. With an aggressive adaptive gate, reductions can reach 45 to 50% fewer model calls at lower fidelity (SSIM 0.73 to 0.74).

TL;DR: 提出了迭代式基于群体的训练(IPBT)，一种新的PBT变体，能自动调整超参数更新间隔这一重要元超参数，通过任务无关的权重信息重用和时间变化的贝叶斯优化来重新初始化超参数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于群体的训练(PBT)算法中，超参数更新间隔是一个重要的元超参数，会显著影响性能，但目前没有有效的方法来设置其值。

Method: IPBT通过重启机制重用权重信息，并利用时间变化的贝叶斯优化来重新初始化超参数，自动调整超参数更新间隔。

Conclusion: IPBT是一种有效的PBT变体，能自动调整关键元超参数，在多个任务上表现优异。

Abstract: Hyperparameter Optimization (HPO) can lift the burden of tuning hyperparameters (HPs) of neural networks. HPO algorithms from the Population Based Training (PBT) family are efficient thanks to dynamically adjusting HPs every few steps of the weight optimization. Recent results indicate that the number of steps between HP updates is an important meta-HP of all PBT variants that can substantially affect their performance. Yet, no method or intuition is available for efficiently setting its value. We introduce Iterated Population Based Training (IPBT), a novel PBT variant that automatically adjusts this HP via restarts that reuse weight information in a task-agnostic way and leverage time-varying Bayesian optimization to reinitialize HPs. Evaluation on 8 image classification and reinforcement learning tasks shows that, on average, our algorithm matches or outperforms 5 previous PBT variants and other HPO algorithms (random search, ASHA, SMAC3), without requiring a budget increase or any changes to its HPs.

Motivation: 现有AI生成文本检测器的训练和评估依赖于高质量的基准数据集，但DetectRL等数据集存在AI生成文本的简单模式，这些模式可能被检测器作为捷径利用，导致检测器容易受到欺骗攻击。

Conclusion: 数据清洗是提高AI生成文本检测器鲁棒性的有效方法，经过处理的数据集已公开可用。

Abstract: Large language models are increasingly used for many applications. To prevent illicit use, it is desirable to be able to detect AI-generated text. Training and evaluation of such detectors critically depend on suitable benchmark datasets. Several groups took on the tedious work of collecting, curating, and publishing large and diverse datasets for this task. However, it remains an open challenge to ensure high quality in all relevant aspects of such a dataset. For example, the DetectRL benchmark exhibits relatively simple patterns of AI-generation in 98.5% of the Claude-LLM data. These patterns may include introductory words such as "Sure! Here is the academic article abstract:", or instances where the LLM rejects the prompted task. In this work, we demonstrate that detectors trained on such data use such patterns as shortcuts, which facilitates spoofing attacks on the trained detectors. We consequently reprocessed the DetectRL dataset with several cleansing operations. Experiments show that such data cleansing makes direct attacks more difficult. The reprocessed dataset is publicly available.

TL;DR: CoCo-MILP通过建模变量间的对比性和约束内的竞争性，改进了基于GNN的MILP求解器，显著提升了求解性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于GNN的MILP求解方法存在两个层面的结构不对齐问题：学习目标层面，二元交叉熵损失独立处理变量，忽略了相对优先级；模型架构层面，标准GNN消息传递平滑了变量表示，错过了约束内的竞争关系。

Method: 提出CoCo-MILP框架，包含变量间对比损失（VCL）和约束内竞争GNN层，分别解决目标对齐和架构对齐问题。

Result: 在标准基准测试中，CoCo-MILP显著优于现有学习方法，相比传统求解器将求解差距减少了高达68.12%。

Conclusion: 通过显式建模变量间的对比性和约束内的竞争性，CoCo-MILP有效提升了MILP求解性能，验证了结构对齐的重要性。

Abstract: Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) is a cornerstone of combinatorial optimization, yet solving large-scale instances remains a significant computational challenge. Recently, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have shown promise in accelerating MILP solvers by predicting high-quality solutions. However, we identify that existing methods misalign with the intrinsic structure of MILP problems at two levels. At the leaning objective level, the Binary Cross-Entropy (BCE) loss treats variables independently, neglecting their relative priority and yielding plausible logits. At the model architecture level, standard GNN message passing inherently smooths the representations across variables, missing the natural competitive relationships within constraints. To address these challenges, we propose CoCo-MILP, which explicitly models inter-variable Contrast and intra-constraint Competition for advanced MILP solution prediction. At the objective level, CoCo-MILP introduces the Inter-Variable Contrastive Loss (VCL), which explicitly maximizes the embedding margin between variables assigned one versus zero. At the architectural level, we design an Intra-Constraint Competitive GNN layer that, instead of homogenizing features, learns to differentiate representations of competing variables within a constraint, capturing their exclusionary nature. Experimental results on standard benchmarks demonstrate that CoCo-MILP significantly outperforms existing learning-based approaches, reducing the solution gap by up to 68.12% compared to traditional solvers.

Conclusion: SCMax框架通过自监督共识最大化实现了完全无参数的聚类，能够有效确定最优聚类数量，在现实场景中具有更好的适用性。

Abstract: Clustering is a fundamental task in unsupervised learning, but most existing methods heavily rely on hyperparameters such as the number of clusters or other sensitive settings, limiting their applicability in real-world scenarios. To address this long-standing challenge, we propose a novel and fully parameter-free clustering framework via Self-supervised Consensus Maximization, named SCMax. Our framework performs hierarchical agglomerative clustering and cluster evaluation in a single, integrated process. At each step of agglomeration, it creates a new, structure-aware data representation through a self-supervised learning task guided by the current clustering structure. We then introduce a nearest neighbor consensus score, which measures the agreement between the nearest neighbor-based merge decisions suggested by the original representation and the self-supervised one. The moment at which consensus maximization occurs can serve as a criterion for determining the optimal number of clusters. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate that the proposed framework outperforms existing clustering approaches designed for scenarios with an unknown number of clusters.

Conclusion: 推理时FK控制将基于扩散的蛋白质设计推广到任意、不可微分和奖励不可知的目标，为引导分子生成提供了统一且模型无关的框架。

Abstract: Diffusion-based models have recently enabled the generation of realistic and diverse protein structures, yet they remain limited in their ability to steer outcomes toward specific functional or biochemical objectives, such as binding affinity or sequence composition. Here we extend the Feynman-Kac (FK) steering framework, an inference-time control approach, to diffusion-based protein design. By coupling FK steering with structure generation, the method guides sampling toward desirable structural or energetic features while maintaining the diversity of the underlying diffusion process. To enable simultaneous generation of both sequence and structure properties, rewards are computed on models refined through ProteinMPNN and all-atom relaxation. Applied to binder design, FK steering consistently improves predicted interface energetics across diverse targets with minimal computational overhead. More broadly, this work demonstrates that inference-time FK control generalizes diffusion-based protein design to arbitrary, non-differentiable, and reward-agnostic objectives, providing a unified and model-independent framework for guided molecular generation.

Abstract: Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) lies at the core of many real-world combinatorial optimization (CO) problems, traditionally solved by branch-and-bound (B&B). A key driver influencing B&B solvers efficiency is the variable selection heuristic that guides branching decisions. Looking to move beyond static, hand-crafted heuristics, recent work has explored adapting traditional reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms to the B&B setting, aiming to learn branching strategies tailored to specific MILP distributions. In parallel, RL agents have achieved remarkable success in board games, a very specific type of combinatorial problems, by leveraging environment simulators to plan via Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). Building on these developments, we introduce Plan-and-Branch-and-Bound (PlanB&B), a model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) agent that leverages a learned internal model of the B&B dynamics to discover improved branching strategies. Computational experiments empirically validate our approach, with our MBRL branching agent outperforming previous state-of-the-art RL methods across four standard MILP benchmarks.

Abstract: In recent years, graph neural networks (GNNs) have been widely applied in tackling combinatorial optimization problems. However, existing methods still suffer from limited accuracy when addressing that on complex graphs and exhibit poor scalability, since full training requires loading the whole adjacent matrix and all embeddings at a time, the it may results in out of memory of a single machine. This limitation significantly restricts their applicability to large-scale scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose a distributed GNN-based training framework for combinatorial optimization. In details, firstly, large graph is partition into several small subgraphs. Then the individual subgraphs are full trained, providing a foundation for efficient local optimization. Finally, reinforcement learning (RL) are employed to take actions according to GNN output, to make sure the restrictions between cross nodes can be learned. Extensive experiments are conducted on both real large-scale social network datasets (e.g., Facebook, Youtube) and synthetically generated high-complexity graphs, which demonstrate that our framework outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in both solution quality and computational efficiency. Moreover, the experiments on large graph instances also validate the scalability of the model.

Conclusion: 研究提供了关于预测编码何时以及为何诱导结构化表征的原则性理解，弥合了经验观察与理论基础之间的差距。

Abstract: Predictive coding is a framework for understanding the formation of low-dimensional internal representations mirroring the environment's latent structure. The conditions under which such representations emerge remain unclear. In this work, we investigate how the prediction horizon and network depth shape the solutions of predictive coding tasks. Using a minimal abstract setting inspired by prior work, we show empirically and theoretically that sufficiently deep networks trained with multi-step prediction horizons consistently recover the underlying latent structure, a phenomenon explained through the Ordinary Least Squares estimator structure and biases in learning dynamics. We then extend these insights to nonlinear networks and complex datasets, including piecewise linear functions, MNIST, multiple latent states and higher dimensional state geometries. Our results provide a principled understanding of when and why predictive coding induces structured representations, bridging the gap between empirical observations and theoretical foundations.

Conclusion: DFA攻击揭示了联邦学习面临的新型威胁，GuardFed提供了一种有效的防御方案，能够在保持隐私的同时确保模型效用和公平性

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables privacy-preserving collaborative model training but remains vulnerable to adversarial behaviors that compromise model utility or fairness across sensitive groups. While extensive studies have examined attacks targeting either objective, strategies that simultaneously degrade both utility and fairness remain largely unexplored. To bridge this gap, we introduce the Dual-Facet Attack (DFA), a novel threat model that concurrently undermines predictive accuracy and group fairness. Two variants, Synchronous DFA (S-DFA) and Split DFA (Sp-DFA), are further proposed to capture distinct real-world collusion scenarios. Experimental results show that existing robust FL defenses, including hybrid aggregation schemes, fail to resist DFAs effectively. To counter these threats, we propose GuardFed, a self-adaptive defense framework that maintains a fairness-aware reference model using a small amount of clean server data augmented with synthetic samples. In each training round, GuardFed computes a dual-perspective trust score for every client by jointly evaluating its utility deviation and fairness degradation, thereby enabling selective aggregation of trustworthy updates. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that GuardFed consistently preserves both accuracy and fairness under diverse non-IID and adversarial conditions, achieving state-of-the-art performance compared with existing robust FL methods.

Conclusion: RENTT提供了一种精确、高效的方法将神经网络转换为决策树，解决了可解释AI中的忠实性问题，能够提供全局、区域和局部层面的真实特征重要性分析。

Abstract: Although neural networks are a powerful tool, their widespread use is hindered by the opacity of their decisions and their black-box nature, which result in a lack of trustworthiness. To alleviate this problem, methods in the field of explainable Artificial Intelligence try to unveil how such automated decisions are made. But explainable AI methods are often plagued by missing faithfulness/correctness, meaning that they sometimes provide explanations that do not align with the neural network's decision and logic. Recently, transformations to decision trees have been proposed to overcome such problems. Unfortunately, they typically lack exactness, scalability, or interpretability as the size of the neural network grows. Thus, we generalize these previous results, especially by considering convolutional neural networks, recurrent neural networks, non-ReLU activation functions, and bias terms. Our findings are accompanied by rigorous proofs and we present a novel algorithm RENTT (Runtime Efficient Network to Tree Transformation) designed to compute an exact equivalent decision tree representation of neural networks in a manner that is both runtime and memory efficient. The resulting decision trees are multivariate and thus, possibly too complex to understand. To alleviate this problem, we also provide a method to calculate the ground truth feature importance for neural networks via the equivalent decision trees - for entire models (global), specific input regions (regional), or single decisions (local). All theoretical results are supported by detailed numerical experiments that emphasize two key aspects: the computational efficiency and scalability of our algorithm, and that only RENTT succeeds in uncovering ground truth explanations compared to conventional approximation methods like LIME and SHAP. All code is available at https://github.com/HelenaM23/RENTT .

Conclusion: TCNN通过激活操作、并行架构和信息融合层的优势，在保持低复杂度的同时实现了卓越的泛化能力和鲁棒性。

Abstract: It is challenging to reduce the complexity of neural networks while maintaining their generalization ability and robustness, especially for practical applications. Conventional solutions for this problem incorporate quantum-inspired neural networks with Kronecker products and hybrid tensor neural networks with MPO factorization and fully-connected layers. Nonetheless, the generalization power and robustness of the fully-connected layers are not as outstanding as circuit models in quantum computing. In this paper, we propose a novel tensor circuit neural network (TCNN) that takes advantage of the characteristics of tensor neural networks and residual circuit models to achieve generalization ability and robustness with low complexity. The proposed activation operation and parallelism of the circuit in complex number field improves its non-linearity and efficiency for feature learning. Moreover, since the feature information exists in the parameters in both the real and imaginary parts in TCNN, an information fusion layer is proposed for merging features stored in those parameters to enhance the generalization capability. Experimental results confirm that TCNN showcases more outstanding generalization and robustness with its average accuracies on various datasets 2\%-3\% higher than those of the state-of-the-art compared models. More significantly, while other models fail to learn features under noise parameter attacking, TCNN still showcases prominent learning capability owing to its ability to prevent gradient explosion. Furthermore, it is comparable to the compared models on the number of trainable parameters and the CPU running time. An ablation study also indicates the advantage of the activation operation, the parallelism architecture and the information fusion layer.

Result: 实验验证MoC能显著节省内存并提高吞吐量，同时保持竞争力的模型性能。

Conclusion: MoC是一种有效的FFN架构创新，能够在不牺牲性能的前提下显著减少LLM的激活内存开销。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable success across diverse artificial intelligence tasks, driven by scaling laws that correlate model size and training data with performance improvements. However, this scaling paradigm incurs substantial memory overhead, creating significant challenges for both training and inference. While existing research has primarily addressed parameter and optimizer state memory reduction, activation memory-particularly from feed-forward networks (FFNs)-has become the critical bottleneck, especially when FlashAttention is implemented. In this work, we conduct a detailed memory profiling of LLMs and identify FFN activations as the predominant source to activation memory overhead. Motivated by this, we introduce Mixture-of-Channels (MoC), a novel FFN architecture that selectively activates only the Top-K most relevant channels per token determined by SwiGLU's native gating mechanism. MoC substantially reduces activation memory during pre-training and improves inference efficiency by reducing memory access through partial weight loading into GPU SRAM. Extensive experiments validate that MoC delivers significant memory savings and throughput gains while maintaining competitive model performance.

Abstract: Restless Multi-Armed Bandits (RMABs) are powerful models for decision-making under uncertainty, yet classical formulations typically assume fixed dynamics, an assumption often violated in nonstationary environments. We introduce MARBLE (Multi-Armed Restless Bandits in a Latent Markovian Environment), which augments RMABs with a latent Markov state that induces nonstationary behavior. In MARBLE, each arm evolves according to a latent environment state that switches over time, making policy learning substantially more challenging. We further introduce the Markov-Averaged Indexability (MAI) criterion as a relaxed indexability assumption and prove that, despite unobserved regime switches, under the MAI criterion, synchronous Q-learning with Whittle Indices (QWI) converges almost surely to the optimal Q-function and the corresponding Whittle indices. We validate MARBLE on a calibrated simulator-embedded (digital twin) recommender system, where QWI consistently adapts to a shifting latent state and converges to an optimal policy, empirically corroborating our theoretical findings.

Method: 提出了DFAX（Distributional Feature Attribution eXplanations）方法，这是一种新颖的模型无关特征归因方法，直接基于数据分布来解释分类器预测。

Result: 通过大量实验证明，DFAX比现有最先进的基线方法更有效和高效。

Conclusion: DFAX是首个基于数据分布的特征归因方法，能够克服现有方法的局限性，为特征归因问题提供了正式的解决方案。

Abstract: The proliferation of complex, black-box AI models has intensified the need for techniques that can explain their decisions. Feature attribution methods have become a popular solution for providing post-hoc explanations, yet the field has historically lacked a formal problem definition. This paper addresses this gap by introducing a formal definition for the problem of feature attribution, which stipulates that explanations be supported by an underlying probability distribution represented by the given dataset. Our analysis reveals that many existing model-agnostic methods fail to meet this criterion, while even those that do often possess other limitations. To overcome these challenges, we propose Distributional Feature Attribution eXplanations (DFAX), a novel, model-agnostic method for feature attribution. DFAX is the first feature attribution method to explain classifier predictions directly based on the data distribution. We show through extensive experiments that DFAX is more effective and efficient than state-of-the-art baselines.

TL;DR: WOODELF是一个新的SHAP算法，通过将决策树、博弈论和布尔逻辑整合到统一框架中，实现了线性时间计算背景SHAP值，在CPU和GPU上都能高效运行，相比现有方法实现了16-165倍的加速。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的SHAP计算方法效率较低，特别是在处理大规模数据集时。WOODELF旨在提供一种更高效的SHAP计算框架，能够在不同硬件平台上快速计算各种博弈论值。

Method: WOODELF为每个消费者构建一个伪布尔公式，捕捉特征值、决策树集成结构和整个背景数据集，然后利用这种表示在线性时间内计算背景SHAP值。该方法还支持路径依赖SHAP、Shapley交互值、Banzhaf值等的计算。

Result: 在包含300万行、500万背景样本和127个特征的数据集上，WOODELF在CPU上计算所有背景Shapley值耗时162秒，在GPU上仅需16秒，相比现有最佳方法的44分钟，分别实现了16倍和165倍的加速。

Conclusion: WOODELF提供了一个高效、统一的SHAP计算框架，通过整合决策树、博弈论和布尔逻辑，显著提升了计算效率，支持大规模SHAP值计算，并具有良好的硬件兼容性。

Abstract: SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) is a key tool for interpreting decision tree ensembles by assigning contribution values to features. It is widely used in finance, advertising, medicine, and other domains. Two main approaches to SHAP calculation exist: Path-Dependent SHAP, which leverages the tree structure for efficiency, and Background SHAP, which uses a background dataset to estimate feature distributions.
  We introduce WOODELF, a SHAP algorithm that integrates decision trees, game theory, and Boolean logic into a unified framework. For each consumer, WOODELF constructs a pseudo-Boolean formula that captures their feature values, the structure of the decision tree ensemble, and the entire background dataset. It then leverages this representation to compute Background SHAP in linear time. WOODELF can also compute Path-Dependent SHAP, Shapley interaction values, Banzhaf values, and Banzhaf interaction values.
  WOODELF is designed to run efficiently on CPU and GPU hardware alike. Available via the WOODELF Python package, it is implemented using NumPy, SciPy, and CuPy without relying on custom C++ or CUDA code. This design enables fast performance and seamless integration into existing frameworks, supporting large-scale computation of SHAP and other game-theoretic values in practice.
  For example, on a dataset with 3,000,000 rows, 5,000,000 background samples, and 127 features, WOODELF computed all Background Shapley values in 162 seconds on CPU and 16 seconds on GPU - compared to 44 minutes required by the best method on any hardware platform, representing 16x and 165x speedups, respectively.

Method: 将缺失的响应线视为可学习的先验，探索使用条件扩散模型来插值稀疏采样的正弦图

Result: 该方法为新型PET几何结构提供了数据驱动的解决方案

Conclusion: 条件扩散模型能够有效恢复PET成像中缺失的响应线信息，支持更灵活、成本效益更高的探测器布局

Abstract: Accurate PET imaging increasingly requires methods that support unconstrained detector layouts from walk-through designs to long-axial rings where gaps and open sides lead to severely undersampled sinograms. Instead of constraining the hardware to form complete cylinders, we propose treating the missing lines-of-responses as a learnable prior. Data-driven approaches, particularly generative models, offer a promising pathway to recover this missing information. In this work, we explore the use of conditional diffusion models to interpolate sparsely sampled sinograms, paving the way for novel, cost-efficient, and patient-friendly PET geometries in real clinical settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有序列推荐系统容易受到对抗攻击，但传统数据投毒方法需要大规模用户访问或虚假资料，缺乏实用性。配置文件污染攻击虽然更实用，但现有方法存在过度依赖序列水平影响和导致可检测分布偏移的问题

Method: 提出CREAT方法，结合双层优化框架和多奖励强化学习：1）模式平衡奖励策略，整合模式反转奖励和分布一致性奖励；2）约束组相对强化学习，通过动态屏障约束和组共享经验回放实现逐步扰动

Result: 大量实验证明了CREAT的有效性

Conclusion: CREAT方法能够平衡对抗效果和隐蔽性，在最小化可检测性的同时实现目标污染

Abstract: Sequential Recommenders, which exploit dynamic user intents through interaction sequences, is vulnerable to adversarial attacks. While existing attacks primarily rely on data poisoning, they require large-scale user access or fake profiles thus lacking practicality. In this paper, we focus on the Profile Pollution Attack that subtly contaminates partial user interactions to induce targeted mispredictions. Previous PPA methods suffer from two limitations, i.e., i) over-reliance on sequence horizon impact restricts fine-grained perturbations on item transitions, and ii) holistic modifications cause detectable distribution shifts. To address these challenges, we propose a constrained reinforcement driven attack CREAT that synergizes a bi-level optimization framework with multi-reward reinforcement learning to balance adversarial efficacy and stealthiness. We first develop a Pattern Balanced Rewarding Policy, which integrates pattern inversion rewards to invert critical patterns and distribution consistency rewards to minimize detectable shifts via unbalanced co-optimal transport. Then we employ a Constrained Group Relative Reinforcement Learning paradigm, enabling step-wise perturbations through dynamic barrier constraints and group-shared experience replay, achieving targeted pollution with minimal detectability. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of CREAT.

Conclusion: AGT填补了训练数据扰动认证研究的空白，为对抗性数据投毒、机器遗忘和差分隐私等关键场景提供了形式化认证工具。

Abstract: The impact of inference-time data perturbation (e.g., adversarial attacks) has been extensively studied in machine learning, leading to well-established certification techniques for adversarial robustness. In contrast, certifying models against training data perturbations remains a relatively under-explored area. These perturbations can arise in three critical contexts: adversarial data poisoning, where an adversary manipulates training samples to corrupt model performance; machine unlearning, which requires certifying model behavior under the removal of specific training data; and differential privacy, where guarantees must be given with respect to substituting individual data points. This work introduces Abstract Gradient Training (AGT), a unified framework for certifying robustness of a given model and training procedure to training data perturbations, including bounded perturbations, the removal of data points, and the addition of new samples. By bounding the reachable set of parameters, i.e., establishing provable parameter-space bounds, AGT provides a formal approach to analyzing the behavior of models trained via first-order optimization methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GDPR和CCPA等隐私法规要求完全遗忘未经授权的数据，但现有时空图模型难以高效删除单个节点，因为节点信息会在时空维度全局扩散，现有遗忘方法成本接近完全重新训练。

Method: 提出CallosumNet框架，包含两个关键技术：(1)增强子图构建(ESC)，基于生物启发的虚拟神经节自适应构建局部子图；(2)全局神经节桥接(GGB)，从局部子图重建全局时空依赖关系。

Result: 在四个真实世界数据集上的实验表明，CallosumNet仅产生1%-2%的相对MAE损失，显著优于现有最优方法。消融研究验证了两种技术的有效性。

Conclusion: CallosumNet为时空图数据遗忘提供了一个高效完整的解决方案，能够满足严格隐私法规的要求，同时保持模型性能。

Abstract: Spatio-temporal graphs are widely used in modeling complex dynamic processes such as traffic forecasting, molecular dynamics, and healthcare monitoring. Recently, stringent privacy regulations such as GDPR and CCPA have introduced significant new challenges for existing spatio-temporal graph models, requiring complete unlearning of unauthorized data. Since each node in a spatio-temporal graph diffuses information globally across both spatial and temporal dimensions, existing unlearning methods primarily designed for static graphs and localized data removal cannot efficiently erase a single node without incurring costs nearly equivalent to full model retraining. Therefore, an effective approach for complete spatio-temporal graph unlearning is a pressing need. To address this, we propose CallosumNet, a divide-and-conquer spatio-temporal graph unlearning framework inspired by the corpus callosum structure that facilitates communication between the brain's two hemispheres. CallosumNet incorporates two novel techniques: (1) Enhanced Subgraph Construction (ESC), which adaptively constructs multiple localized subgraphs based on several factors, including biologically-inspired virtual ganglions; and (2) Global Ganglion Bridging (GGB), which reconstructs global spatio-temporal dependencies from these localized subgraphs, effectively restoring the full graph representation. Empirical results on four diverse real-world datasets show that CallosumNet achieves complete unlearning with only 1%-2% relative MAE loss compared to the gold model, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art baselines. Ablation studies verify the effectiveness of both proposed techniques.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决动态工业物联网环境中模型需要选择性遗忘过时或错误知识的问题，避免现有方法依赖保留数据带来的计算负担和隐私合规冲突。

Method: PTE框架包含两个阶段：1) 通过梯度上升探测遗忘类决策边界并生成编辑指令；2) 推-拉协同优化：推分支主动拆解目标类决策区域，拉分支通过掩码知识蒸馏锚定保留类知识。

Result: 在CWRU和SCUT-FD等多个通用和工业基准测试中，PTE在遗忘效果和模型效用之间取得了良好平衡。

Conclusion: PTE提供了一种高效、平衡的知识编辑方法，仅需遗忘数据和原始模型，适用于工业物联网环境中的动态知识管理需求。

Abstract: In dynamic Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) environments, models need the ability to selectively forget outdated or erroneous knowledge. However, existing methods typically rely on retain data to constrain model behavior, which increases computational and energy burdens and conflicts with industrial data silos and privacy compliance requirements. To address this, we propose a novel retain-free unlearning framework, referred to as Probing then Editing (PTE). PTE frames unlearning as a probe-edit process: first, it probes the decision boundary neighborhood of the model on the to-be-forgotten class via gradient ascent and generates corresponding editing instructions using the model's own predictions. Subsequently, a push-pull collaborative optimization is performed: the push branch actively dismantles the decision region of the target class using the editing instructions, while the pull branch applies masked knowledge distillation to anchor the model's knowledge on retained classes to their original states. Benefiting from this mechanism, PTE achieves efficient and balanced knowledge editing using only the to-be-forgotten data and the original model. Experimental results demonstrate that PTE achieves an excellent balance between unlearning effectiveness and model utility across multiple general and industrial benchmarks such as CWRU and SCUT-FD.

Motivation: 传统语义遗传编程依赖固定语法变换，TSGP旨在学习能产生相似语义的多样化结构变异。

Method: 使用预训练transformer模型作为变异算子，通过目标语义距离SD_t控制语义空间中的步长。

Result: 在24个真实世界和合成数据集上，TSGP平均排名1.58，显著优于标准GP、SLIM_GSGP等方法，且产生更紧凑的解。

Conclusion: SD_t提供了平衡探索和开发的有效机制，小值实现持续改进但程序较大，大值促进快速收敛和紧凑性。

Abstract: Transformer Semantic Genetic Programming (TSGP) is a semantic search approach that uses a pre-trained transformer model as a variation operator to generate offspring programs with controlled semantic similarity to a given parent. Unlike other semantic GP approaches that rely on fixed syntactic transformations, TSGP aims to learn diverse structural variations that lead to solutions with similar semantics. We find that a single transformer model trained on millions of programs is able to generalize across symbolic regression problems of varying dimension. Evaluated on 24 real-world and synthetic datasets, TSGP significantly outperforms standard GP, SLIM_GSGP, Deep Symbolic Regression, and Denoising Autoencoder GP, achieving an average rank of 1.58 across all benchmarks. Moreover, TSGP produces more compact solutions than SLIM_GSGP, despite its higher accuracy. In addition, the target semantic distance $\mathrm{SD}_t$ is able to control the step size in the semantic space: small values of $\mathrm{SD}_t$ enable consistent improvement in fitness but often lead to larger programs, while larger values promote faster convergence and compactness. Thus, $\mathrm{SD}_t$ provides an effective mechanism for balancing exploration and exploitation.

Abstract: Theoretically exploring the advantages of neural networks might be one of the most challenging problems in the AI era. An adaptive feature program has recently been proposed to analyze the feature learning characteristic property of neural networks in a more abstract way. Motivated by the celebrated Le Cam equivalence, we advocate the over-parametrized sequence models to further simplify the analysis of the training dynamics of adaptive feature program and present several supporting evidences for the adaptive feature program. More precisely, after having introduced the feature error measure (FEM) to characterize the quality of the learned feature, we show that the FEM is decreasing during the training process of several concrete adaptive feature models including linear regression, single/multiple index models, etc. We believe that this hints at the potential successes of the adaptive feature program.

Conclusion: 将群对称性融入稀疏自编码器能够产生对下游任务更有用的特征，为处理具有对称性的科学数据提供了有效的机制可解释性工具。

Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) have proven useful in disentangling the opaque activations of neural networks, primarily large language models, into sets of interpretable features. However, adapting them to domains beyond language, such as scientific data with group symmetries, introduces challenges that can hinder their effectiveness. We show that incorporating such group symmetries into the SAEs yields features more useful in downstream tasks. More specifically, we train autoencoders on synthetic images and find that a single matrix can explain how their activations transform as the images are rotated. Building on this, we develop adaptively equivariant SAEs that can adapt to the base model's level of equivariance. These adaptive SAEs discover features that lead to superior probing performance compared to regular SAEs, demonstrating the value of incorporating symmetries in mechanistic interpretability tools.

Abstract: We propose a method that uses large language models to assist graph machine learning under personalization and privacy constraints. The approach combines data augmentation for sparse graphs, prompt and instruction tuning to adapt foundation models to graph tasks, and in-context learning to supply few-shot graph reasoning signals. These signals parameterize a Dynamic UMAP manifold of client-specific graph embeddings inside a Bayesian variational objective for personalized federated learning. The method supports node classification and link prediction in low-resource settings and aligns language model latent representations with graph structure via a cross-modal regularizer. We outline a convergence argument for the variational aggregation procedure, describe a differential privacy threat model based on a moments accountant, and present applications to knowledge graph completion, recommendation-style link prediction, and citation and product graphs. We also discuss evaluation considerations for benchmarking LLM-assisted graph machine learning.

Abstract: With rapid urbanization in recent decades, traffic congestion has intensified due to increased movement of people and goods. As planning shifts from demand-based to supply-oriented strategies, Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) have become essential for managing traffic within existing infrastructure. A core ITS function is traffic forecasting, enabling proactive measures like ramp metering, signal control, and dynamic routing through platforms such as Google Maps. This study assesses the performance of statistical, machine learning (ML), and deep learning (DL) models in forecasting traffic speed and flow using real-world data from California's Harbor Freeway, sourced from the Caltrans Performance Measurement System (PeMS). Each model was evaluated over 20 forecasting windows (up to 1 hour 40 minutes) using RMSE, MAE, and R-Square metrics. Results show ANFIS-GP performs best at early windows with RMSE of 0.038, MAE of 0.0276, and R-Square of 0.9983, while Bi-LSTM is more robust for medium-term prediction due to its capacity to model long-range temporal dependencies, achieving RMSE of 0.1863, MAE of 0.0833, and R-Square of 0.987 at a forecasting of 20. The degradation in model performance was quantified using logarithmic transformation, with slope values used to measure robustness. Among DL models, Bi-LSTM had the flattest slope (0.0454 RMSE, 0.0545 MAE for flow), whereas ANFIS-GP had 0.1058 for RMSE and 0.1037 for flow MAE. The study concludes by identifying hybrid models as a promising future direction.

Conclusion: 该框架成功增强了太阳高能粒子事件预测模型的透明度，为理解此类事件的物理机制提供了更深入的见解。

Abstract: Solar energetic particle (SEP) events, as one of the most prominent manifestations of solar activity, can generate severe hazardous radiation when accelerated by solar flares or shock waves formed aside from coronal mass ejections (CMEs). However, most existing data-driven methods used for SEP predictions are operated as black-box models, making it challenging for solar physicists to interpret the results and understand the underlying physical causes of such events rather than just obtain a prediction. To address this challenge, we propose a novel framework that integrates global explanations and ad-hoc feature mapping to enhance model transparency and provide deeper insights into the decision-making process. We validate our approach using a dataset of 341 SEP events, including 244 significant (>=10 MeV) proton events exceeding the Space Weather Prediction Center S1 threshold, spanning solar cycles 22, 23, and 24. Furthermore, we present an explainability-focused case study of major SEP events, demonstrating how our method improves explainability and facilitates a more physics-informed understanding of SEP event prediction.

Rather than training policies or value heads, we investigate whether planning can be carried out directly in an evaluation-aligned embedding space. We introduce SOLIS, which learns such a space using supervised contrastive learning. In this representation, outcome similarity is captured by proximity, and a single global advantage vector orients the space from losing to winning regions. Candidate actions are then ranked according to their alignment with this direction, reducing planning to vector operations in latent space. We demonstrate this approach in chess, where SOLIS uses only a shallow search guided by the learned embedding to reach competitive strength under constrained conditions. More broadly, our results suggest that evaluation-aligned latent planning offers a lightweight alternative to traditional dynamics models or policy learning.

TL;DR: AdaCuRL是一个自适应课程强化学习框架，通过粗到细的难度估计和自适应课程调度来解决强化学习中的梯度饥饿和策略退化问题，在多种推理基准测试中显著提升了LLMs和MLLMs的性能。

Result: 在多种推理基准测试上的广泛实验表明，AdaCuRL在LLMs和MLLMs上均实现了显著的性能提升。

Conclusion: AdaCuRL通过自适应课程强化学习有效解决了现有方法的局限性，为增强语言模型的推理能力提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has demonstrated considerable potential for enhancing reasoning in large language models (LLMs). However, existing methods suffer from Gradient Starvation and Policy Degradation when training directly on samples with mixed difficulty. To mitigate this, prior approaches leverage Chain-of-Thought (CoT) data, but the construction of high-quality CoT annotations remains labor-intensive. Alternatively, curriculum learning strategies have been explored but frequently encounter challenges, such as difficulty mismatch, reliance on manual curriculum design, and catastrophic forgetting. To address these issues, we propose AdaCuRL, a Adaptive Curriculum Reinforcement Learning framework that integrates coarse-to-fine difficulty estimation with adaptive curriculum scheduling. This approach dynamically aligns data difficulty with model capability and incorporates a data revisitation mechanism to mitigate catastrophic forgetting. Furthermore, AdaCuRL employs adaptive reference and sparse KL strategies to prevent Policy Degradation. Extensive experiments across diverse reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that AdaCuRL consistently achieves significant performance improvements on both LLMs and MLLMs.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于概率密度感知的核心集选择方法PDAC，通过分析样本对误差抑制的贡献，发现高概率密度样本在误差抑制中起主导作用，从而实现了更高效的持续学习缓冲区构建。

Result: 广泛的对比实验表明，该方法在各种持续学习设置下均优于其他基线方法，同时确保了良好的效率。

Conclusion: 基于概率密度感知的核心集选择方法能够有效提升持续学习的性能，同时保持较高的计算效率，为实际应用提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Rehearsal-based Continual Learning (CL) maintains a limited memory buffer to store replay samples for knowledge retention, making these approaches heavily reliant on the quality of the stored samples. Current Rehearsal-based CL methods typically construct the memory buffer by selecting a representative subset (referred to as coresets), aiming to approximate the training efficacy of the full dataset with minimal storage overhead. However, mainstream Coreset Selection (CS) methods generally formulate the CS problem as a bi-level optimization problem that relies on numerous inner and outer iterations to solve, leading to substantial computational cost thus limiting their practical efficiency. In this paper, we aim to provide a more efficient selection logic and scheme for coreset construction. To this end, we first analyze the Mean Squared Error (MSE) between the buffer-trained model and the Bayes-optimal model through the perspective of localized error decomposition to investigate the contribution of samples from different regions to MSE suppression. Further theoretical and experimental analyses demonstrate that samples with high probability density play a dominant role in error suppression. Inspired by this, we propose the Probability Density-Aware Coreset (PDAC) method. PDAC leverages the Projected Gaussian Mixture (PGM) model to estimate each sample's joint density, enabling efficient density-prioritized buffer selection. Finally, we introduce the streaming Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm to enhance the adaptability of PGM parameters to streaming data, yielding Streaming PDAC (SPDAC) for streaming scenarios. Extensive comparative experiments show that our methods outperforms other baselines across various CL settings while ensuring favorable efficiency.

TL;DR: AutoSynth是一个无需参考数据集即可自动发现和优化工作流的框架，通过蒙特卡洛树搜索和数据集无关的混合奖励来解决冷启动问题，显著减少人工工作量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 监督微调LLM需要高质量数据集，但人工标注成本高昂。现有自动化方法面临冷启动问题，需要标注数据集进行奖励建模，这在主观开放任务中尤其困难。

Method: 将问题重构为蒙特卡洛树搜索，使用新颖的数据集无关混合奖励进行引导。该奖励通过两个LLM作为评判员组件实现元学习：一个使用动态生成的任务特定指标评估样本质量，另一个评估工作流代码和提示质量。

Result: 在主观教育任务实验中，专家设计的工作流获得更高的人类偏好率（96-99% vs AutoSynth的40-51%），但AutoSynth生成数据训练的模型显著优于基线（40-51% vs 2-5%），在某些指标上匹配或超越专家工作流，同时将人工工作量从5-7小时减少到30分钟（减少90%以上）。

Conclusion: AutoSynth解决了以数据为中心的AI中的冷启动问题，为主观LLM任务提供了可扩展、经济高效的方法。

Abstract: Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) of large language models (LLMs) for specialized tasks requires high-quality datasets, but manual curation is prohibitively expensive. Synthetic data generation offers scalability, but its effectiveness relies on complex, multi-stage workflows, integrating prompt engineering and model orchestration. Existing automated workflow methods face a cold start problem: they require labeled datasets for reward modeling, which is especially problematic for subjective, open-ended tasks with no objective ground truth. We introduce AutoSynth, a framework that automates workflow discovery and optimization without reference datasets by reframing the problem as a Monte Carlo Tree Search guided by a novel dataset-free hybrid reward. This reward enables meta-learning through two LLM-as-judge components: one evaluates sample quality using dynamically generated task-specific metrics, and another assesses workflow code and prompt quality. Experiments on subjective educational tasks show that while expert-designed workflows achieve higher human preference rates (96-99% win rates vs. AutoSynth's 40-51%), models trained on AutoSynth-generated data dramatically outperform baselines (40-51% vs. 2-5%) and match or surpass expert workflows on certain metrics, suggesting discovery of quality dimensions beyond human intuition. These results are achieved while reducing human effort from 5-7 hours to just 30 minutes (>90% reduction). AutoSynth tackles the cold start issue in data-centric AI, offering a scalable, cost-effective method for subjective LLM tasks. Code: https://github.com/bisz9918-maker/AutoSynth.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 经典确定性策略梯度方法只使用一阶信息，收敛速度较慢。为了利用性能函数的曲率信息来加速收敛，需要扩展确定性演员-评论家框架

Result: 数值实验表明，该方法相比标准确定性演员-评论家基线实现了更好的收敛性和性能

Conclusion: 所提出的二阶确定性演员-评论家框架能够有效利用曲率信息，在强化学习中实现比一阶方法更快的收敛

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a second-order deterministic actor-critic framework in reinforcement learning that extends the classical deterministic policy gradient method to exploit curvature information of the performance function. Building on the concept of compatible function approximation for the critic, we introduce a quadratic critic that simultaneously preserves the true policy gradient and an approximation of the performance Hessian. A least-squares temporal difference learning scheme is then developed to estimate the quadratic critic parameters efficiently. This construction enables a quasi-Newton actor update using information learned by the critic, yielding faster convergence compared to first-order methods. The proposed approach is general and applicable to any differentiable policy class. Numerical examples demonstrate that the method achieves improved convergence and performance over standard deterministic actor-critic baselines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要关注特定基因变异对有限表型的影响，或依赖人工整理的遗传信息作为输入，限制了可扩展性和泛化性。直接从基因序列广泛预测基因敲除诱导的多种表型异常这一任务尚未充分探索。

Method: 采用对比多标签学习目标捕捉表型间相关性，结合排他性正则化确保生物学一致性，并引入基因功能瓶颈层提供可解释的功能机制概念。

Result: 在四个数据集上，GenePheno在基因中心Fmax和表型中心AUC指标上达到最先进水平，案例研究证明其能够揭示基因功能机制。

Conclusion: GenePheno成功建立了从基因序列到多表型异常的直接预测框架，为可扩展的假设驱动实验提供了有力工具。

Abstract: Exploring how genetic sequences shape phenotypes is a fundamental challenge in biology and a key step toward scalable, hypothesis-driven experimentation. The task is complicated by the large modality gap between sequences and phenotypes, as well as the pleiotropic nature of gene-phenotype relationships. Existing sequence-based efforts focus on the degree to which variants of specific genes alter a limited set of phenotypes, while general gene knockout induced phenotype abnormality prediction methods heavily rely on curated genetic information as inputs, which limits scalability and generalizability. As a result, the task of broadly predicting the presence of multiple phenotype abnormalities under gene knockout directly from gene sequences remains underexplored. We introduce GenePheno, the first interpretable multi-label prediction framework that predicts knockout induced phenotypic abnormalities from gene sequences. GenePheno employs a contrastive multi-label learning objective that captures inter-phenotype correlations, complemented by an exclusive regularization that enforces biological consistency. It further incorporates a gene function bottleneck layer, offering human interpretable concepts that reflect functional mechanisms behind phenotype formation. To support progress in this area, we curate four datasets with canonical gene sequences as input and multi-label phenotypic abnormalities induced by gene knockouts as targets. Across these datasets, GenePheno achieves state-of-the-art gene-centric Fmax and phenotype-centric AUC, and case studies demonstrate its ability to reveal gene functional mechanisms.

Motivation: 机器学习模型在推理过程中通常需要大量算术计算，这会增加延迟和功耗。为了解决这个问题，需要开发更高效的计算方法。

Method: 采用数字时间域计算方法，包括延迟累积机制替代昂贵的类别算术和、赢家通吃方案替代传统幅度比较器、汉明距离驱动的时间域方案用于多类TMs，以及差分延迟路径结合前导一检测器的对数延迟压缩方案。

Conclusion: 数字时间域计算方法为Tsetlin机器推理提供了一种高效的解决方案，显著降低了计算成本和功耗。

Abstract: Machine learning fits model parameters to approximate input-output mappings, predicting unknown samples. However, these models often require extensive arithmetic computations during inference, increasing latency and power consumption. This paper proposes a digital-time-domain computing approach for Tsetlin machine (TM) inference process to address these challenges. This approach leverages a delay accumulation mechanism to mitigate the costly arithmetic sums of classes and employs a Winner-Takes-All scheme to replace conventional magnitude comparators. Specifically, a Hamming distance-driven time-domain scheme is implemented for multi-class TMs. Furthermore, differential delay paths, combined with a leading-ones-detector logarithmic delay compression digital-time-domain scheme, are utilised for the coalesced TMs, accommodating both binary-signed and exponential-scale delay accumulation issues. Compared to the functionally equivalent, post-implementation digital TM architecture baseline, the proposed architecture demonstrates orders-of-magnitude improvements in energy efficiency and throughput.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法要么忽略结构上下文，要么依赖昂贵、内存密集的编码，限制了吞吐量和可扩展性。需要一种既能保持化学有效性又能与蛋白质结合口袋结构兼容的配体设计方法。

Method: 提出SiDGen框架，支持两种条件路径：简化模式从蛋白质嵌入中汇集粗粒度结构信号，完整模式注入局部成对偏置以实现更强耦合。采用粗步长折叠机制和最近邻上采样来缓解对张量的二次内存成本。

Conclusion: SiDGen能够提供可扩展的口袋感知分子设计，为高通量药物发现的条件生成提供了实用途径。

Abstract: Designing ligands that are both chemically valid and structurally compatible with protein binding pockets is a key bottleneck in computational drug discovery. Existing approaches either ignore structural context or rely on expensive, memory-intensive encoding that limits throughput and scalability. We present SiDGen (Structure-informed Diffusion Generator), a protein-conditioned diffusion framework that integrates masked SMILES generation with lightweight folding-derived features for pocket awareness. To balance expressivity with efficiency, SiDGen supports two conditioning pathways: a streamlined mode that pools coarse structural signals from protein embeddings and a full mode that injects localized pairwise biases for stronger coupling. A coarse-stride folding mechanism with nearest-neighbor upsampling alleviates the quadratic memory costs of pair tensors, enabling training on realistic sequence lengths. Learning stability is maintained through in-loop chemical validity checks and an invalidity penalty, while large-scale training efficiency is restored \textit{via} selective compilation, dataloader tuning, and gradient accumulation. In automated benchmarks, SiDGen generates ligands with high validity, uniqueness, and novelty, while achieving competitive performance in docking-based evaluations and maintaining reasonable molecular properties. These results demonstrate that SiDGen can deliver scalable, pocket-aware molecular design, providing a practical route to conditional generation for high-throughput drug discovery.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决在有限平行语料情况下机器翻译模型的训练问题，通过明确惩罚语言无效输出来提高模型性能。

Method: 使用合成生成的目标语言语法违规样本作为负样本，在损失函数中引入严重性加权惩罚机制，当模型对这些语言无效输出分配高概率时进行惩罚。

Result: 在所有架构上均获得改进：性能良好模型获得3-12% BLEU提升，初始支持不足模型获得56-89%提升；提供5倍数据效率，用1,000样本训练可达到或超过5,000样本正常训练的效果。

Conclusion: NSL-MT为有限标注平行语料场景提供了一种数据高效的替代训练方法。

Abstract: We introduce Negative Space Learning MT (NSL-MT), a training method that teaches models what not to generate by encoding linguistic constraints as severity-weighted penalties in the loss function. NSL-MT increases limited parallel data with synthetically generated violations of target language grammar, explicitly penalizing the model when it assigns high probability to these linguistically invalid outputs. We demonstrate that NSL-MT delivers improvements across all architectures: 3-12\% BLEU gains for well-performing models and 56-89\% gains for models lacking descent initial support. Furthermore, NSL-MT provides a 5x data efficiency multiplier -- training with 1,000 examples matches or exceeds normal training with 5,000 examples. Thus, NSL-MT provides a data-efficient alternative training method for settings where there is limited annotated parallel corporas.

Motivation: 随着摩尔定律放缓，FPGA等异构计算平台在加速HPC工作负载方面越来越受关注，需要更灵活的FPGA加速方法。

Method: 将MLIR OpenMP方言与高级综合(HLS)方言结合，构建可移植的FPGA编译流程，支持标准OpenMP指令进行内核优化。

Result: 成功实现基于指令的FPGA加速，显著减少了开发工作量，展示了MLIR生态系统的可组合性优势。

Conclusion: 该方法为基于指令的FPGA加速建立了一个灵活且可扩展的路径，完全集成在MLIR生态系统中。

Abstract: With the slowing of Moore's Law, heterogeneous computing platforms such as Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) have gained increasing interest for accelerating HPC workloads. In this work we present, to the best of our knowledge, the first implementation of selective code offloading to FPGAs via the OpenMP target directive within MLIR. Our approach combines the MLIR OpenMP dialect with a High-Level Synthesis (HLS) dialect to provide a portable compilation flow targeting FPGAs. Unlike prior OpenMP FPGA efforts that rely on custom compilers, by contrast we integrate with MLIR and so support any MLIR-compatible front end, demonstrated here with Flang. Building upon a range of existing MLIR building blocks significantly reduces the effort required and demonstrates the composability benefits of the MLIR ecosystem. Our approach supports manual optimisation of offloaded kernels through standard OpenMP directives, and this work establishes a flexible and extensible path for directive-based FPGA acceleration integrated within the MLIR ecosystem.

Motivation: AI和云数据中心的高能耗加剧了碳足迹问题，其恒定电力需求与不稳定的可再生能源发电之间存在矛盾，需要数据中心灵活性来改善电网可再生能源吸收。

Method: 定义和计算数据中心负载解耦的功率和能量需求，评估设计的分布和管理方法，包括站点变化和数据中心-电网合作（双向共享与控制 vs 单向信息共享）。

Result: 优化分布可实现98%的潜在电网碳减排，仅需70%的总解耦需求；数据中心-电网合作可实现1.4倍的电网碳减排；经济上平均收益大于本地解耦成本。

Conclusion: 数据中心负载解耦是降低碳排放的有效方法，优化分布和电网合作能显著提升效果，虽然经济可行但站点间差异需要电网干预。

Abstract: The exploding power consumption of AI and cloud datacenters (DCs) intensifies the long-standing concerns about their carbon footprint, especially because DCs' need for constant power clashes with volatile renewable generation needed for grid decarbonization. DC flexibility (a.k.a. load adaptation) is a key to reducing DC carbon emissions by improving grid renewable absorption.
  DC flexibility can be created, without disturbing datacenter capacity by decoupling a datacenter's power capacity and grid load with a collection of energy resources. Because decoupling can be costly, we study how to best distribute and manage decoupling to maximize benefits for all. Key considerations include site variation and datacenter-grid cooperation.
  We first define and compute the power and energy needs of datacenter load decoupling, and then we evaluate designed distribution and management approaches. Evaluation shows that optimized distribution can deliver >98% of the potential grid carbon reduction with 70% of the total decoupling need. For management, DC-grid cooperation (2-way sharing and control vs. 1-way info sharing) enables 1.4x grid carbon reduction. Finally, we show that decoupling may be economically viable, as on average datacenters can get power cost and carbon emissions benefits greater than their local costs of decoupling. However, skew across sites suggests grid intervention may be required.

Motivation: 了解不同云服务商在HPC工作负载下的CPU性能与成本效益，为选择最优云实例提供数据支持。

Method: 使用SPEC ACCEL套件中的OpenMP工作负载，测试AWS、Azure、GCP、OCI四大云服务商的Intel、AMD、ARM通用实例类型，比较按需和一年折扣定价。

Result: AWS在所有三种实例类型中运行时间最短但收费最高；OCI在所有CPU家族中最经济但运行较慢；Azure表现中等；GCP从Intel切换到AMD时性能显著提升，但其ARM实例比自家AMD慢两倍且更贵；AWS的ARM实例比其Intel和AMD实例快达49%。

Conclusion: 实例选择和云服务商选择对运行时间和成本有显著影响，应根据工作负载优先级（原始速度或成本最小化）来指导实例类型决策。

Abstract: This paper evaluates HPC-style CPU performance and cost in virtualized cloud infrastructures using a subset of OpenMP workloads in the SPEC ACCEL suite. Four major cloud providers by market share AWS, Azure, Google Cloud Platform (GCP), and Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) are compared across Intel, AMD, and ARM general purpose instance types under both on-demand and one-year discounted pricing. AWS consistently delivers the shortest runtime in all three instance types, yet charges a premium, especially for on-demand usage. OCI emerges as the most economical option across all CPU families, although it generally runs workloads more slowly than AWS. Azure often exhibits mid-range performance and cost, while GCP presents a mixed profile: it sees a notable boost when moving from Intel to AMD. On the other hand, its ARM instance is more than twice as slow as its own AMD offering and remains significantly more expensive. AWS's internal comparisons reveal that its ARM instance can outperform its Intel and AMD siblings by up to 49 percent in runtime. These findings highlight how instance choices and provider selection can yield substantial variations in both runtime and price, indicating that workload priorities, whether raw speed or cost minimization, should guide decisions on instance types.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) is a promising approach to enabling collaborative model training without centralized data sharing, a crucial requirement in scientific domains where data privacy, ownership, and compliance constraints are critical. However, building user-friendly enterprise-level FL frameworks that are both scalable and privacy-preserving remains challenging, especially when bridging the gap between local prototyping and distributed deployment across heterogeneous client computing infrastructures. In this paper, based on our experiences building the Advanced Privacy-Preserving Federated Learning (APPFL) framework, we present our vision for an enterprise-grade, privacy-preserving FL framework designed to scale seamlessly across computing environments. We identify several key capabilities that such a framework must provide: (1) Scalable local simulation and prototyping to accelerate experimentation and algorithm design; (2) seamless transition from simulation to deployment; (3) distributed deployment across diverse, real-world infrastructures, from personal devices to cloud clusters and HPC systems; (4) multi-level abstractions that balance ease of use and research flexibility; and (5) comprehensive privacy and security through techniques such as differential privacy, secure aggregation, robust authentication, and confidential computing. We further discuss architectural designs to realize these goals. This framework aims to bridge the gap between research prototypes and enterprise-scale deployment, enabling scalable, reliable, and privacy-preserving AI for science.

Motivation: 多租户环境下的GPU集群经常存在利用率低下的问题，NVIDIA MIG虽然提供硬件级隔离，但其硬件刚性和传统一对一分配模型导致严重的资源碎片化和集群范围的低利用率。

Method: Flex-MIG采用软件框架，将MIG从一对一分配改为一对多分配模型，支持跨MIG实例的主机共享内存集合操作，无需硬件修改。

Result: Flex-MIG消除了需要排空的重配置，减少了碎片化，在多样化跟踪中将makespan提高了高达17%。

Conclusion: 将MIG的操作模型重新设计为软件协调层，可以显著提高集群效率。

Abstract: GPU clusters in multi-tenant settings often suffer from underutilization, making GPU-sharing technologies essential for efficient resource use. Among them, NVIDIA Multi-Instance GPU (MIG) has gained traction for providing hardware-level isolation that enables concurrent workloads without interference. However, MIG's hardware rigidity and the conventional one-to-one allocation model jointly lead to severe fragmentation and cluster-wide underutilization. We present Flex-MIG, a software-only framework that replaces one-to-one with a one-to-many allocation model and enables host-shared-memory collectives across MIG instances without hardware modification. Flex-MIG eliminates drain-required reconfiguration, reduces fragmentation, and improves makespan by up to 17% across diverse traces, showing that rethinking MIG's operational model as a software-coordinated layer substantially improves cluster efficiency.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的用户空间同步调度方法CES，通过组合交换调度来优化协程等用户空间任务的同步性能，避免了传统同步原语带来的不必要延迟。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代编程语言广泛支持协程进行高并行或异步应用，用户空间同步避免了重量级系统调用，但现有同步原语仍采用内核级调度视角，导致关键路径上出现不必要的延迟，限制了吞吐量。

Method: 开发了组合交换调度(CES)方法，确保竞争临界区保持在同一执行线程上，同时将可并行工作均匀分布到其他线程。

Result: 该方法可应用于多种现有语言和库，在应用基准测试中实现3倍性能提升，在微基准测试中实现8倍性能提升。

Conclusion: CES方法重新思考了用户空间任务的同步问题，通过创新的调度策略显著提升了协程等用户空间并发模型的性能。

Abstract: Coroutines are experiencing a renaissance as many modern programming languages support the use of cooperative multitasking for highly parallel or asynchronous applications. One of the greatest advantages of this is that concurrency and synchronization is manged entirely in the userspace, omitting heavy-weight system calls. However, we find that state-of-the-art userspace synchronization primitives approach synchronization in the userspace from the perspective of kernel-level scheduling. This introduces unnecessary delays on the critical path of the application, limiting throughput. In this paper, we re-think synchronization for tasks that are scheduled entirely in the userspace (e.g., coroutines, fibers, etc.). We develop Combine-and-Exchange Scheduling (CES), a novel scheduling approach that ensures contended critical sections stay on the same thread of execution while parallelizable work is evenly spread across the remaining threads. We show that our approach can be applied to many existing languages and libraries, resulting in 3-fold performance improvements in application benchmarks as well as 8-fold performance improvements in microbenchmarks.

TL;DR: CMP是一种无协调的锁自由队列，通过有界保护窗口恢复严格FIFO语义，在高并发场景下性能优于现有队列1.72-4倍。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有锁自由队列为防范ABA、释放后使用等风险而引入复杂协调机制，导致保护开销远超队列操作本身，在AI时代大规模并发场景下问题尤为突出。

Method: 提出循环内存保护(CMP)机制，使用有界保护窗口提供实际的重用保证，无需协调即可保持严格FIFO、无界容量和锁自由进展。

Result: CMP在高竞争场景下性能比现有最优锁自由队列提升1.72-4倍，可扩展到数百线程，同时保持严格FIFO语义。

Conclusion: 高度并发队列可以在不削弱队列语义的前提下回归基本简单性，有界保护窗口比无限保护更实用且高效。

Abstract: The queue is conceptually one of the simplest data structures-a basic FIFO container. However, ensuring correctness in the presence of concurrency makes existing lock-free implementations significantly more complex than their original form. Coordination mechanisms introduced to prevent hazards such as ABA, use-after-free, and unsafe reclamation often dominate the design, overshadowing the queue itself. Many schemes compromise strict FIFO ordering, unbounded capacity, or lock-free progress to mask coordination overheads. Yet the true source of complexity lies in the pursuit of infinite protection against reclamation hazards--theoretically sound but impractical and costly. This pursuit not only drives unnecessary complexity but also creates a protection paradox where excessive protection reduces system resilience rather than improving it. While such costs may be tolerable in conventional workloads, the AI era has shifted the paradigm: training and inference pipelines involve hundreds to thousands of concurrent threads per node, and at this scale, protection and coordination overheads dominate, often far heavier than the basic queue operations themselves.
  This paper introduces Cyclic Memory Protection (CMP), a coordination-free queue that preserves strict FIFO semantics, unbounded capacity, and lock-free progress while restoring simplicity. CMP reclaims the strict FIFO that other approaches sacrificed through bounded protection windows that provide practical reclamation guarantees. We prove strict FIFO and safety via linearizability and bounded reclamation analysis, and show experimentally that CMP outperforms state-of-the-art lock-free queues by up to 1.72-4x under high contention while maintaining scalability to hundreds of threads. Our work demonstrates that highly concurrent queues can return to their fundamental simplicity without weakening queue semantics.

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: SPADA是一种针对空间数据流架构的编程语言，通过抽象底层架构细节，提供对数据放置、数据流模式和异步操作的精确控制，显著简化了编程复杂度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 空间数据流架构（如Cerebras晶圆级引擎）在AI和科学计算中表现出色，但编程困难，需要显式协调数据移动和异步计算。现有编程模型忽视了这些架构的独特能力。

Method: 设计了SPADA编程语言，引入严格的数据流语义框架定义路由正确性、数据竞争和死锁，并实现针对Cerebras CSL的多级编译。

Result: SPADA将复杂并行模式的代码量减少6-8倍，在三个数量级上实现接近理想的弱扩展性，并可作为领域特定语言的中间表示。

Conclusion: SPADA通过统一的空间数据流架构编程模型，推动了这些高性能计算平台的理论基础和实践可用性。

Abstract: Spatial dataflow architectures like the Cerebras Wafer-Scale Engine achieve exceptional performance in AI and scientific applications by leveraging distributed memory across processing elements (PEs) and localized computation. However, programming these architectures remains challenging due to the need for explicit orchestration of data movement through reconfigurable networks-on-chip and asynchronous computation triggered by data arrival. Existing FPGA and CGRA programming models emphasize loop scheduling but overlook the unique capabilities of spatial dataflow architectures, particularly efficient dataflow over regular grids and intricate routing management.
  We present SPADA, a programming language that provides precise control over data placement, dataflow patterns, and asynchronous operations while abstracting architecture-specific low-level details. We introduce a rigorous dataflow semantics framework for SPADA that defines routing correctness, data races, and deadlocks. Additionally, we design and implement a compiler targeting Cerebras CSL with multi-level lowering.
  SPADA serves as both a high-level programming interface and an intermediate representation for domain-specific languages (DSLs), which we demonstrate with the GT4Py stencil DSL. SPADA enables developers to express complex parallel patterns -- including pipelined reductions and multi-dimensional stencils -- in 6--8x less code than CSL with near-ideal weak scaling across three orders of magnitude. By unifying programming for spatial dataflow architectures under a single model, SPADA advances both the theoretical foundations and practical usability of these emerging high-performance computing platforms.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在之前已对集中式和去中心化联邦学习算法进行形式化验证的基础上，需要对第三个通用TDM通信算法进行同样的形式化验证以确保其正确性

Method: 采用两阶段方法：第一阶段构建忠实反映Python代码的CSP模型；第二阶段使用PAT模型检查器自动验证算法的无死锁性（安全性）和成功终止性（活性）

Result: 成功证明了通用TDM通信算法的正确性，验证了其安全性和活性属性

Conclusion: 通过形式化验证方法确认了Python联邦学习测试床中通用TDM通信算法的可靠性，为边缘系统中的联邦学习应用提供了理论保障

Abstract: The Python Testbed for Federated Learning Algorithms is a simple FL framework targeting edge systems, which provides the three generic algorithms: the centralized federated learning, the decentralized federated learning, and the universal TDM communication in the current time slot. The first two were formally verified in a previous paper using the CSP process algebra, and in this paper, we use the same approach to formally verify the third one, in two phases. In the first phase, we construct the CSP model as a faithful representation of the real Python code. In the second phase, the model checker PAT automatically proves correctness of the third generic algorithm by proving its deadlock freeness (safety property) and successful termination (liveness property).

Motivation: 随着大语言模型规模不断扩大，分布式推理需要高效扩展到多节点环境，而all-reduce操作成为常见性能瓶颈。

Method: 使用多个推理引擎进行实验分析，开发了基于递归倍增和NVSHMEM的层次化all-reduce算法NVRAR。

Result: NVRAR在128KB-2MB消息大小范围内比NCCL延迟降低1.9-3.6倍，在Llama 3.1 405B模型上端到端批量延迟降低1.72倍。

Conclusion: NVRAR算法有效解决了多节点分布式推理中的all-reduce瓶颈问题，显著提升了大规模LLM的推理性能。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) continue to grow in size, distributed inference has become increasingly important. Model-parallel strategies must now efficiently scale not only across multiple GPUs but also across multiple nodes. In this work, we present a detailed performance study of multi-node distributed inference using LLMs on GPU-based supercomputers. We conduct experiments with several state-of-the-art inference engines alongside YALIS, a research-oriented prototype engine designed for controlled experimentation. We analyze the strong-scaling behavior of different model-parallel schemes and identify key bottlenecks. Since all-reduce operations are a common performance bottleneck, we develop NVRAR, a hierarchical all-reduce algorithm based on recursive doubling with NVSHMEM. NVRAR achieves up to 1.9x-3.6x lower latency than NCCL for message sizes between 128 KB and 2 MB on HPE Slingshot and InfiniBand interconnects. Integrated into YALIS, NVRAR achieves up to a 1.72x reduction in end-to-end batch latency for the Llama 3.1 405B model in multi-node decode-heavy workloads using tensor parallelism.

TL;DR: 提出一种基于储层计算（RC）的低复杂度分子通信检测器，用于解决移动场景中严重的符号间干扰问题，相比传统检测器和复杂机器学习方法，RC在性能、计算复杂度和延迟方面均有显著优势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 分子通信在移动场景中面临严重的时变符号间干扰，传统基于信道状态信息的检测方法难以适用，而深度学习虽然具有适应性但计算复杂度高，不适合资源受限的微纳设备。

Method: 采用储层计算架构，利用固定的循环非线性储层将时变接收信号投影到高维状态空间，将复杂的时间检测问题转化为简单的线性分类任务，无需显式信道建模或复杂重训练。

Result: 在3D移动分子通信仿真环境中，RC检测器显著优于传统检测器，在严重符号间干扰下性能优于复杂机器学习方法（LSTM、CNN、MLP），且训练参数少（300 vs 264k），推理延迟极低（约1μs/符号）。

Conclusion: RC检测器为移动分子通信提供了一种高效、低复杂度的解决方案，在性能、资源效率和实时性方面具有显著优势。

Abstract: Diffusion-based Molecular Communication (MC) is inherently challenged by severe inter-symbol interference (ISI). This is significantly amplified in mobile scenarios, where the channel impulse response (CIR) becomes time-varying and stochastic. Obtaining accurate Channel State Information (CSI) for traditional model-based detection is intractable in such dynamic environments. While deep learning (DL) offers adaptability, its complexity is unsuitable for resource-constrained micro/nanodevices. This paper proposes a low-complexity Reservoir Computing (RC) based detector. The RC architecture utilizes a fixed, recurrent non-linear reservoir to project the time-varying received signal into a high-dimensional state space. This effectively transforms the complex temporal detection problem into a simple linear classification task, capturing ISI dynamics without explicit channel modeling or complex retraining. Evaluated in a realistic 3D mobile MC simulation environment (Smoldyn), our RC detector significantly outperforms classical detectors and achieves superior performance compared to complex ML methods (LSTM, CNN, MLP) under severe ISI. Importantly, RC achieves this with significantly fewer trainable parameters (e.g., 300 vs. up to 264k for MLP) and ultra-low latency inference (approx. 1 $μ$s per symbol).

Conclusion: 提出的快速算法和偏置补偿策略有效解决了AMC电路中互连电阻引起的精度和可扩展性问题，揭示了最优偏置随矩阵尺寸和互连电阻的缩放行为。

Abstract: Analog matrix computing (AMC) circuits based on resistive random-access memory (RRAM) have shown strong potential for accelerating matrix operations. However, as matrix size grows, interconnect resistance increasingly degrades computational accuracy and limits circuit scalability. Modeling and evaluating these effects are therefore critical for developing effective mitigation strategies. Traditional SPICE (Simulation Program with Integrated Circuit Emphasis) simulators, which rely on modified nodal analysis, become prohibitively slow for large-scale AMC circuits due to the quadratic growth of nodes and feedback connections. In this work, we model AMC circuits with interconnect resistance for two key operations-matrix inversion (INV) and eigenvector computation (EGV), and propose fast solving algorithms tailored for each case. The algorithms exploit the sparsity of the Jacobian matrix, enabling rapid and accurate solutions. Compared to SPICE, they achieve several orders of magnitude acceleration while maintaining high accuracy. We further extend the approach to open-loop matrix-vector multiplication (MVM) circuits, demonstrating similar efficiency gains. Finally, leveraging these fast solvers, we develop a bias-based compensation strategy that reduces interconnect-induced errors by over 50% for INV and 70% for EGV circuits. It also reveals the scaling behavior of the optimal bias with respect to matrix size and interconnect resistance.

Abstract: This paper proposes an optimized Reconfigurable Internet of Things (RIoT) framework that integrates optical and radio wireless technologies with a focus on energy efficiency, scalability, and adaptability. To address the inherent complexity of hybrid optical-radio environments, a high-fidelity Digital Twin (DT) is developed within the Network Simulator 3 (NS-3) platform. The DT models deploy subsystems of the RIoT architecture, including radio frequency (RF) communication, optical wireless communication (OWC), and energy harvesting and consumption mechanisms that enable autonomous operation. Real-time energy and power measurements from target hardware platforms are also incorporated to ensure accurate representation of physical behavior and enable runtime analysis and optimization. Building on this foundation, a proactive cross-layer optimization strategy is devised to balance energy efficiency and quality of service (QoS). The strategy dynamically reconfigures RIoT nodes by adapting transmission rates, wake/sleep scheduling, and access technology selection. Results demonstrate that the proposed framework, combining digital twin technology, hybrid optical-radio integration, and data-driven energy modeling, substantially enhances the performance, resilience, and sustainability of 6G IoT networks.
