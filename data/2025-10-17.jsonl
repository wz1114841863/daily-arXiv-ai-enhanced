By repeatedly opening or keeping a\nDRAM row (aggressor row) open, we show that it is possible to disturb DRAM\ncells through a DRAM column (i.e., bitline) and induce bitflips in DRAM cells\nsharing the same columns as the aggressor row (across multiple DRAM subarrays).\nWith ColumnDisturb, the activation of a single row concurrently disturbs cells\nacross as many as three subarrays (e.g., 3072 rows) as opposed to\nRowHammer/RowPress, which affect only a few neighboring rows of the aggressor\nrow in a single subarray. We rigorously characterize ColumnDisturb and its\ncharacteristics under various operational conditions using 216 DDR4 and 4 HBM2\nchips from three major manufacturers. Among our 27 key experimental\nobservations, we highlight two major results and their implications.\n  First, ColumnDisturb affects chips from all three major manufacturers and\nworsens as DRAM technology scales down to smaller node sizes (e.g., the minimum\ntime to induce the first ColumnDisturb bitflip reduces by up to 5.06x). We\nobserve that, in existing DRAM chips, ColumnDisturb induces bitflips within a\nstandard DDR4 refresh window (e.g., in 63.6 ms) in multiple cells. We predict\nthat, as DRAM technology node size reduces, ColumnDisturb would worsen in\nfuture DRAM chips, likely causing many more bitflips in the standard refresh\nwindow. Second, ColumnDisturb induces bitflips in many (up to 198x) more rows\nthan retention failures. Therefore, ColumnDisturb has strong implications for\nretention-aware refresh mechanisms that leverage the heterogeneity in cell\nretention times: our detailed analyses show that ColumnDisturb greatly reduces\nthe benefits of such mechanisms."}

We introduce an online per state action\nestimator called Phi that quantifies the likelihood of returning to a prior\nstate within a fixed horizon K. This measure is used to adjust the penalty term\nduring temporal difference updates dynamically, integrating reversibility\nawareness directly into the value function.

By minimizing structural entropy, the decoupled\nredundancy is reduced, and theoretically grounded upper and lower bounds are\nproposed for optimization.

Yet, they remain highly susceptible to\nadversarial perturbations and targeted backdoor attacks. Mitigating such\nvulnerabilities remains an open challenge, especially given that the\nlarge-scale nature of the models prohibits retraining to ensure safety.\nExisting backdoor removal approaches rely on costly fine-tuning to override the\nharmful behavior, and can often degrade performance on other unrelated tasks.\nThis raises the question of whether backdoors can be removed without\ncompromising the general capabilities of the models. In this work, we address\nthis question and study how backdoors are encoded in the model weight space,\nfinding that they are disentangled from other benign tasks. Specifically, this\nseparation enables the isolation and erasure of the backdoor's influence on the\nmodel with minimal impact on clean performance. Building on this insight, we\nintroduce a simple unlearning method that leverages such disentanglement.\nThrough extensive experiments with CLIP-based models and common adversarial\ntriggers, we show that, given the knowledge of the attack, our method achieves\napproximately perfect unlearning, while retaining, on average, 96% of clean\naccuracy. Additionally, we demonstrate that even when the attack and its\npresence are unknown, our method successfully unlearns backdoors by proper\nestimation using reverse-engineered triggers.

The key new idea is an\nanalytical approximation of a kernel's eigenvalues and eigenfunctions with\nrespect to an anisotropic data distribution. The eigenfunctions resemble\nHermite polynomials of the data, so we call this approximation the Hermite\neigenstructure ansatz (HEA). We prove the HEA for Gaussian data, but we find\nthat real image data is often \"Gaussian enough\" for the HEA to hold well in\npractice, enabling us to predict learning curves by applying prior results\nrelating kernel eigenstructure to test risk.

Some prior work avoids irreparable errors by asking for help\nfrom a mentor, but a mentor may not always be available. In this work, we\nformalize a model of learning with unbounded rewards without a mentor as a\ntwo-action contextual bandit with an abstain option: at each round the agent\nobserves an input and chooses either to abstain (always 0 reward) or to commit\n(execute a preexisting task policy).
