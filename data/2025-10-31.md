### [1] [Structurally Valid Log Generation using FSM-GFlowNets](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26197)
*Riya Samanta*

Main category: cs.ET

TL;DR: 提出了一个结合有限状态机(FSM)和生成流网络(GFlowNet)的框架，用于生成结构有效且行为多样的合成事件日志，在UI交互日志生成任务中显著优于GPT-4o和Gemini等现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在用户数据有限或受隐私约束的场景下，生成结构有效且行为多样的合成事件日志具有挑战性。现有方法如启发式模拟和基于LLM的生成器往往缺乏结构连贯性或可控性，无法准确表示真实世界系统交互。

Method: 将有限状态机(FSM)与生成流网络(GFlowNet)集成，FSM编码领域特定规则确保句法有效性，GFlowNet通过动态动作掩码和引导采样实现行为变化，使用混合奖励平衡FSM合规性和统计保真度。

Result: 在UI交互日志生成任务中，FSM-GFlowNet的KL散度为0.2769，卡方距离为0.3522，显著优于GPT-4o(2.5294/13.8020)和Gemini(3.7233/63.0355)，二元语法重叠度达0.1214。下游意图分类任务中，仅使用合成日志训练的模型达到与真实数据相当的准确率。

Conclusion: FSM-GFlowNet框架能够生成结构一致、语义有效且多样化的合成事件日志，在统计保真度和下游任务性能方面均优于现有方法，可推广到任何符号序列领域。

Abstract: Generating structurally valid and behaviorally diverse synthetic event logs
for interaction-aware models is a challenging yet crucial problem, particularly
in settings with limited or privacy constrained user data. Existing methods
such as heuristic simulations and LLM based generators often lack structural
coherence or controllability, producing synthetic data that fails to accurately
represent real world system interactions. This paper presents a framework that
integrates Finite State Machines or FSMs with Generative Flow Networks or
GFlowNets to generate structured, semantically valid, and diverse synthetic
event logs. Our FSM-constrained GFlowNet ensures syntactic validity and
behavioral variation through dynamic action masking and guided sampling. The
FSM, derived from expert traces, encodes domain-specific rules, while the
GFlowNet is trained using a flow matching objective with a hybrid reward
balancing FSM compliance and statistical fidelity. We instantiate the framework
in the context of UI interaction logs using the UIC HCI dataset, but the
approach generalizes to any symbolic sequence domain. Experimental results
based on distributional metrics show that our FSM GFlowNet produces realistic,
structurally consistent logs, achieving, for instance, under the real user logs
baseline, a KL divergence of 0.2769 and Chi squared distance of 0.3522,
significantly outperforming GPT-4o's 2.5294/13.8020 and Gemini's
3.7233/63.0355, alongside a leading bigram overlap of 0.1214 vs. GPT 4o's
0.0028 and Gemini's 0.0007. A downstream use case intent classification
demonstrates that classifiers trained solely on our synthetic logs produced
from FSM-GFlowNet achieve competitive accuracy compared to real data.

### [2] [Outperforming Multiserver SRPT at All Loads](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25963)
*Izzy Grosof,Daniela Hurtado-Lange*

Main category: cs.PF

TL;DR: 提出了SEK-SMOD调度策略，这是首个在理论上证明比SRPT-k具有更低平均响应时间的策略，通过特定情况下优先处理大作业来提高服务器利用率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 设计良好的调度策略可以在不增加额外资源的情况下显著提升性能。SRPT-k在重负载极限下达到渐近最优的平均响应时间，但尚无更好的策略被提出

Method: 引入SEK-SMOD策略，在特定场景下优先处理大作业而非小作业以提高服务器利用率，并设计Practical-SEK简化变体进行实证验证

Result: SEK-SMOD在所有负载和作业大小分布下均优于SRPT-k，通过混合最坏情况和随机技术进行相对分析，证明了其相对于SRPT-k基线的改进

Conclusion: SEK-SMOD是首个在理论上证明优于SRPT-k的调度策略，通过优化作业优先级分配策略实现了更好的性能表现

Abstract: A well-designed scheduling policy can unlock significant performance
improvements with no additional resources. Multiserver SRPT (SRPT-$k$) is known
to achieve asymptotically optimal mean response time in the heavy traffic
limit, as load approaches capacity. No better policy is known for the M/G/$k$
queue in any regime.
  We introduce a new policy, SRPT-Except-$k+1$ & Modified SRPT (SEK-SMOD),
which is the first policy to provably achieve lower mean response time than
SRPT-$k$. SEK-SMOD outperforms SRPT-$k$ across all loads and all job size
distributions. The key idea behind SEK-SMOD is to prioritize large jobs over
small jobs in specific scenarios to improve server utilization, and thereby
improve the response time of subsequent jobs in expectation. Our proof is a
novel application of hybrid worst-case and stochastic techniques to relative
analysis, where we analyze the deviations of our proposed SEK-SMOD policy away
from the SRPT-$k$ baseline policy. Furthermore, we design Practical-SEK (a
simplified variant of SEK-SMOD) and empirically verify the improvement over
SRPT-$k$ via simulation.

### [3] [Detecting Anomalies in Machine Learning Infrastructure via Hardware Telemetry](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26008)
*Ziji Chen,Steven Chien,Peng Qian,Noa Zilberman*

Main category: cs.PF

TL;DR: System-X是一个硬件中心的系统优化方法，仅使用硬件信号检测异常，无需了解用户工作负载，可加速机器学习模型执行。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 云平台使用虚拟化导致运营商缺乏对用户工作负载的洞察，这阻碍了资源优化，影响成本效率和执行时间。

Method: 采用硬件中心方法，仅依赖硬件信号，通过无监督学习管道检测异常，分析30多个流行ML模型确保适应性。

Result: 成功识别网络和系统配置问题，将DeepSeek模型加速5.97%。

Conclusion: 无需工作负载知识即可进行系统级优化，硬件信号足以支持有效的异常检测和性能优化。

Abstract: Modern machine learning (ML) has grown into a tightly coupled, full-stack
ecosystem that combines hardware, software, network, and applications. Many
users rely on cloud providers for elastic, isolated, and cost-efficient
resources. Unfortunately, these platforms as a service use virtualization,
which means operators have little insight into the users' workloads. This
hinders resource optimizations by the operator, which is essential to ensure
cost efficiency and minimize execution time. In this paper, we argue that
workload knowledge is unnecessary for system-level optimization. We propose
System-X, which takes a \emph{hardware-centric} approach, relying only on
hardware signals -- fully accessible by operators. Using low-level signals
collected from the system, System-X detects anomalies through an unsupervised
learning pipeline. The pipeline is developed by analyzing over 30 popular ML
models on various hardware platforms, ensuring adaptability to emerging
workloads and unknown deployment patterns. Using System-X, we successfully
identified both network and system configuration issues, accelerating the
DeepSeek model by 5.97%.

### [4] [Approximating Heavy-Tailed Distributions with a Mixture of Bernstein Phase-Type and Hyperexponential Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26524)
*Abdelhakim Ziani,András Horváth,Paolo Ballarini*

Main category: cs.PF

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合BPH和HE分布的新型混合模型，通过优化HE组件的初始参数设置，显著提升了重尾分布的整体拟合质量，能够同时准确捕捉分布的主体和尾部特征。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决重尾分布在现实应用中建模的挑战：BPH分布虽然解析性好但在尾部表现不足，HE分布能适应重尾但对初始参数敏感且在分布主体部分表现不佳。

Method: 构建BPH和HE分布的混合模型，通过优化算法设置HE组件的初始参数，增强模型的鲁棒性并避免生成无效的HE模型。

Result: 实验验证表明混合方法优于单独使用BPH或HE模型，能够同时准确捕捉重尾分布的主体和尾部，在均值和变异系数等参数匹配上有显著提升。

Conclusion: 该混合方法在实际应用中具有实用价值、准确性和精确性，通过排队论实验进一步验证了其有效性。

Abstract: Heavy-tailed distributions, prevalent in a lot of real-world applications
such as finance, telecommunications, queuing theory, and natural language
processing, are challenging to model accurately owing to their slow tail decay.
Bernstein phase-type (BPH) distributions, through their analytical tractability
and good approximations in the non-tail region, can present a good solution,
but they suffer from an inability to reproduce these heavy-tailed behaviors
exactly, thus leading to inadequate performance in important tail areas. On the
contrary, while highly adaptable to heavy-tailed distributions,
hyperexponential (HE) models struggle in the body part of the distribution.
Additionally, they are highly sensitive to initial parameter selection,
significantly affecting their precision.
  To solve these issues, we propose a novel hybrid model of BPH and HE
distributions, borrowing the most desirable features from each for enhanced
approximation quality. Specifically, we leverage an optimization to set initial
parameters for the HE component, significantly enhancing its robustness and
reducing the possibility that the associated procedure results in an invalid HE
model. Experimental validation demonstrates that the novel hybrid approach is
more performant than individual application of BPH or HE models. More
precisely, it can capture both the body and the tail of heavy-tailed
distributions, with a considerable enhancement in matching parameters such as
mean and coefficient of variation. Additional validation through experiments
utilizing queuing theory proves the practical usefulness, accuracy, and
precision of our hybrid approach.

### [5] [CHIPSIM: A Co-Simulation Framework for Deep Learning on Chiplet-Based Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25958)
*Lukas Pfromm,Alish Kanani,Harsh Sharma,Janardhan Rao Doppa,Partha Pratim Pande,Umit Y. Ogras*

Main category: cs.AR

TL;DR: CHIPSIM是一个用于小芯片系统上并行DNN执行的协同仿真框架，能准确建模计算和通信，显著提升仿真精度并支持精细的功耗和热分析。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统单片芯片因制造良率问题无法满足数据密集型应用的计算、存储和通信需求，而小芯片架构提供了一种成本效益高且可扩展的解决方案，但现有仿真方法缺乏所需的精度、速度和灵活性。

Method: 开发了CHIPSIM协同仿真框架，同时建模计算和通信，准确捕捉网络争用和流水线效应，并以微秒级粒度分析小芯片和互连网络的功耗，用于精确的瞬态热分析。

Result: 通过同构/异构小芯片和不同互连网络架构的广泛评估，证明了该框架的通用性，精度提升高达340%，并具备功耗和热分析能力。

Conclusion: CHIPSIM为小芯片系统上的并行DNN执行提供了准确、快速且灵活的仿真解决方案，能够有效支持系统设计和优化。

Abstract: Due to reduced manufacturing yields, traditional monolithic chips cannot keep
up with the compute, memory, and communication demands of data-intensive
applications, such as rapidly growing deep neural network (DNN) models.
Chiplet-based architectures offer a cost-effective and scalable solution by
integrating smaller chiplets via a network-on-interposer (NoI). Fast and
accurate simulation approaches are critical to unlocking this potential, but
existing methods lack the required accuracy, speed, and flexibility. To address
this need, this work presents CHIPSIM, a comprehensive co-simulation framework
designed for parallel DNN execution on chiplet-based systems. CHIPSIM
concurrently models computation and communication, accurately capturing network
contention and pipelining effects that conventional simulators overlook.
Furthermore, it profiles the chiplet and NoI power consumptions at microsecond
granularity for precise transient thermal analysis. Extensive evaluations with
homogeneous/heterogeneous chiplets and different NoI architectures demonstrate
the framework's versatility, up to 340% accuracy improvement, and power/thermal
analysis capability.

### [6] [MIREDO: MIP-Driven Resource-Efficient Dataflow Optimization for Computing-in-Memory Accelerator](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26463)
*Xiaolin He,Cenlin Duan,Yingjie Qi,Xiao Ma,Jianlei Yang*

Main category: cs.AR

TL;DR: 提出了MIREDO框架，将存内计算架构中的数据流优化建模为混合整数规划问题，通过层次化硬件抽象和分析延迟模型来优化深度神经网络加速。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 存内计算架构虽能缓解数据移动瓶颈，但现有优化方法难以充分利用其潜力，导致理论效率与实际系统效率之间存在明显差距。

Method: 采用混合整数规划方法，结合层次化硬件抽象和分析延迟模型，联合建模工作负载特性、数据流策略和存内计算特定约束。

Result: 评估结果显示MIREDO显著提升性能，在各种DNN模型和硬件设置下实现最高3.2倍的性能改进。

Conclusion: MIREDO框架通过系统化探索设计空间，能够有效确定最优数据流配置，显著提升存内计算加速器的实际效率。

Abstract: Computing-in-Memory (CIM) architectures have emerged as a promising solution
for accelerating Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) by mitigating data movement
bottlenecks. However, realizing the potential of CIM requires specialized
dataflow optimizations, which are challenged by an expansive design space and
strict architectural constraints. Existing optimization approaches often fail
to fully exploit CIM accelerators, leading to noticeable gaps between
theoretical and actual system-level efficiency. To address these limitations,
we propose the MIREDO framework, which formulates dataflow optimization as a
Mixed-Integer Programming (MIP) problem. MIREDO introduces a hierarchical
hardware abstraction coupled with an analytical latency model designed to
accurately reflect the complex data transfer behaviors within CIM systems. By
jointly modeling workload characteristics, dataflow strategies, and
CIM-specific constraints, MIREDO systematically navigates the vast design space
to determine the optimal dataflow configurations. Evaluation results
demonstrate that MIREDO significantly enhances performance, achieving up to
$3.2\times$ improvement across various DNN models and hardware setups.

### [7] [A Practitioner's Guide to Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25781)
*Amir Noorizadegan,Sifan Wang,Leevan Ling*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文对Kolmogorov-Arnold网络(KANs)进行了系统性综述，涵盖理论基础、架构变体和实践策略，提供了KANs与MLPs的对比分析、基函数选择指南以及实际应用建议。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: KANs作为传统多层感知机(MLPs)的有前景替代方案，具有更强的表达能力和可解释性。本文旨在填补KANs研究领域的空白，为研究人员和从业者提供全面的技术指南。

Method: 通过收集和分类大量开源实现，系统分析KANs的理论基础、架构变体和实现策略，包括基函数选择、精度提升技术、效率优化和正则化方法。

Result: 建立了KANs与MLPs的形式等价性，展示了KANs在参数效率方面的优势，并提供了基函数选择、架构设计和实践应用的详细指导。

Conclusion: KANs在表达能力和可解释性方面具有显著优势，本文为KANs研究提供了结构化参考，并指出了当前研究空白和未来发展方向。

Abstract: Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) have recently emerged as a promising
alternative to traditional Multilayer Perceptrons (MLPs), inspired by the
Kolmogorov-Arnold representation theorem. Unlike MLPs, which use fixed
activation functions on nodes, KANs employ learnable univariate basis functions
on edges, offering enhanced expressivity and interpretability. This review
provides a systematic and comprehensive overview of the rapidly expanding KAN
landscape, moving beyond simple performance comparisons to offer a structured
synthesis of theoretical foundations, architectural variants, and practical
implementation strategies. By collecting and categorizing a vast array of
open-source implementations, we map the vibrant ecosystem supporting KAN
development. We begin by bridging the conceptual gap between KANs and MLPs,
establishing their formal equivalence and highlighting the superior parameter
efficiency of the KAN formulation. A central theme of our review is the
critical role of the basis function; we survey a wide array of choices,
including B-splines, Chebyshev and Jacobi polynomials, ReLU compositions,
Gaussian RBFs, and Fourier series, and analyze their respective trade-offs in
terms of smoothness, locality, and computational cost. We then categorize
recent advancements into a clear roadmap, covering techniques for improving
accuracy, efficiency, and regularization. Key topics include physics-informed
loss design, adaptive sampling, domain decomposition, hybrid architectures, and
specialized methods for handling discontinuities. Finally, we provide a
practical "Choose-Your-KAN" guide to help practitioners select appropriate
architectures, and we conclude by identifying current research gaps. The
associated GitHub repository https://github.com/AmirNoori68/kan-review
complements this paper and serves as a structured reference for ongoing KAN
research.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: HiMAE是一个分层掩码自编码器框架，通过多分辨率嵌入来探索可穿戴传感器数据中不同时间尺度的预测信号，在保持高效性的同时优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 可穿戴传感器产生大量生理时间序列数据，但不同临床和行为结果可能依赖于不同时间尺度的结构，需要系统性地探索时间分辨率对预测效用的影响。

Method: 结合掩码自编码和分层卷积编码器-解码器，生成多分辨率嵌入，将分辨率从超参数转变为可解释性探针。

Result: 在分类、回归和生成基准测试中，HiMAE始终优于忽略尺度差异的最先进基础模型，且模型规模小几个数量级，可在智能手表CPU上实现亚毫秒级推理。

Conclusion: HiMAE既是高效的自监督学习方法，也是发现可穿戴健康数据中尺度敏感结构的发现工具。

Abstract: Wearable sensors provide abundant physiological time series, yet the
principles governing their predictive utility remain unclear. We hypothesize
that temporal resolution is a fundamental axis of representation learning, with
different clinical and behavioral outcomes relying on structure at distinct
scales. To test this resolution hypothesis, we introduce HiMAE (Hierarchical
Masked Autoencoder), a self supervised framework that combines masked
autoencoding with a hierarchical convolutional encoder decoder. HiMAE produces
multi resolution embeddings that enable systematic evaluation of which temporal
scales carry predictive signal, transforming resolution from a hyperparameter
into a probe for interpretability. Across classification, regression, and
generative benchmarks, HiMAE consistently outperforms state of the art
foundation models that collapse scale, while being orders of magnitude smaller.
HiMAE is an efficient representation learner compact enough to run entirely on
watch, achieving sub millisecond inference on smartwatch class CPUs for true
edge inference. Together, these contributions position HiMAE as both an
efficient self supervised learning method and a discovery tool for scale
sensitive structure in wearable health.

*Qiaoling Chen,Zijun Liu,Peng Sun,Shenggui Li,Guoteng Wang,Ziming Liu,Yonggang Wen,Siyuan Feng,Tianwei Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ReSpec是一个将推测解码技术适配到强化学习训练中的系统，解决了传统推测解码在RL环境中面临的三个关键问题，在Qwen模型上实现了最高4.5倍的加速，同时保持奖励收敛和训练稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型通过强化学习进行适配时，生成阶段消耗超过75%的训练时间。推测解码在服务系统中能加速自回归生成，但其在RL训练中的行为尚未充分探索。

Method: 提出ReSpec系统，通过三种互补机制：动态调整SD配置、通过知识蒸馏演进草稿器、按rollout奖励加权更新，来解决SD在RL系统中的三个关键问题。

Result: 在Qwen模型（3B-14B）上，ReSpec实现了最高4.5倍的加速，同时保持了奖励收敛和训练稳定性。

Conclusion: ReSpec为基于RL的高效LLM适配提供了一个实用的解决方案，成功将推测解码技术适配到强化学习训练环境中。

Abstract: Adapting large language models (LLMs) via reinforcement learning (RL) is
often bottlenecked by the generation stage, which can consume over 75\% of the
training time. Speculative decoding (SD) accelerates autoregressive generation
in serving systems, but its behavior under RL training remains largely
unexplored. We identify three critical gaps that hinder the naive integration
of SD into RL systems: diminishing speedups at large batch sizes, drafter
staleness under continual actor updates, and drafter-induced policy
degradation.
  To address these gaps, we present ReSpec, a system that adapts SD to RL
through three complementary mechanisms: dynamically tuning SD configurations,
evolving the drafter via knowledge distillation, and weighting updates by
rollout rewards. On Qwen models (3B--14B), ReSpec achieves up to 4.5x speedup
while preserving reward convergence and training stability, providing a
practical solution for efficient RL-based LLM adaptation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高能材料的发现受限于实验数据和测试设施，需要开发新的计算方法来加速发现过程。

Method: 结合LSTM网络进行分子生成，使用注意力图神经网络进行性质预测，采用固定SHA-256嵌入与部分可训练表示的集成嵌入空间构建策略。

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效生成多样化化学空间的高能材料，为高能材料发现提供了新的计算框架。

Abstract: High-energy materials (HEMs) are critical for propulsion and defense domains,
yet their discovery remains constrained by experimental data and restricted
access to testing facilities. This work presents a novel approach toward
high-energy molecules by combining Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for
molecular generation and Attentive Graph Neural Networks (GNN) for property
predictions. We propose a transformative embedding space construction strategy
that integrates fixed SHA-256 embeddings with partially trainable
representations. Unlike conventional regularization techniques, this changes
the representational basis itself, reshaping the molecular input space before
learning begins. Without recourse to pretraining, the generator achieves 67.5%
validity and 37.5% novelty. The generated library exhibits a mean Tanimoto
coefficient of 0.214 relative to training set signifying the ability of
framework to generate a diverse chemical space. We identified 37 new super
explosives higher than 9 km/s predicted detonation velocity.

### [11] [An All-Reduce Compatible Top-K Compressor for Communication-Efficient Distributed Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26709)
*Chuyan Chen,Chenyang Ma,Zhangxin Li,Yutong He,Yanjie Dong,Kun Yuan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了ARC-Top-K压缩器，通过轻量级梯度草图对齐节点间的稀疏模式，实现无需索引的All-Reduce操作，在保持Top-K性能的同时显著减少训练时间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大规模分布式机器学习中的通信瓶颈问题，现有梯度压缩方法存在局限性：Rand-K丢弃结构信息且性能差，Top-K保留重要信息但失去收缩特性且需要昂贵的All-Gather操作。

Method: 设计All-Reduce兼容的Top-K压缩器，使用轻量级梯度草图对齐跨节点的稀疏模式，结合动量误差反馈(EF21M)算法。

Result: ARC-Top-K在理论上具有收缩性，与EF21M结合实现线性加速和更快的收敛速度；实证中匹配Top-K精度，同时减少高达60.7%的训练时间。

Conclusion: ARC-Top-K结合了Rand-K的鲁棒性和Top-K的强性能，提供了高效可扩展的梯度压缩解决方案。

Abstract: Communication remains a central bottleneck in large-scale distributed machine
learning, and gradient sparsification has emerged as a promising strategy to
alleviate this challenge. However, existing gradient compressors face notable
limitations: Rand-$K$\ discards structural information and performs poorly in
practice, while Top-$K$\ preserves informative entries but loses the
contraction property and requires costly All-Gather operations. In this paper,
we propose ARC-Top-$K$, an {All-Reduce}-Compatible Top-$K$ compressor that
aligns sparsity patterns across nodes using a lightweight sketch of the
gradient, enabling index-free All-Reduce while preserving globally significant
information. ARC-Top-$K$\ is provably contractive and, when combined with
momentum error feedback (EF21M), achieves linear speedup and sharper
convergence rates than the original EF21M under standard assumptions.
Empirically, ARC-Top-$K$\ matches the accuracy of Top-$K$\ while reducing
wall-clock training time by up to 60.7\%, offering an efficient and scalable
solution that combines the robustness of Rand-$K$\ with the strong performance
of Top-$K$.

TL;DR: 研究通过符号推理任务探究了思维链监督如何影响Transformer的学习动态，发现CoT能加速泛化但无法克服高算法复杂度任务，并揭示了训练过程中推理轨迹与答案的一致性动态演变。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然思维链监督能显著提升Transformer性能，但模型如何学习遵循和受益于CoT的机制仍不清楚，需要系统研究其学习动态。

Method: 在符号推理任务上预训练Transformer，控制任务算法复杂度和数据组成，比较仅输出最终答案和输出CoT轨迹两种训练设置，使用三参数逻辑曲线建模学习动态。

Result: CoT能加速泛化但对高复杂度任务帮助有限；训练早期存在推理轨迹不忠实阶段；CoT会机制性地改变Transformer的内部计算。

Conclusion: CoT监督通过加速泛化和机制性改变内部计算来提升性能，但无法克服任务固有的算法复杂度限制，推理忠实性是一个动态发展的特性。

Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) supervision can substantially improve transformer
performance, yet the mechanisms by which models learn to follow and benefit
from CoT remain poorly understood. We investigate these learning dynamics
through the lens of grokking by pretraining transformers on symbolic reasoning
tasks with tunable algorithmic complexity and controllable data composition to
study their generalization. Models were trained under two settings: (i)
producing only final answers, and (ii) emitting explicit CoT traces before
answering. Our results show that while CoT generally improves task performance,
its benefits depend on task complexity. To quantify these effects, we model the
accuracy of the logarithmic training steps with a three-parameter logistic
curve, revealing how the learning speed and shape vary with task complexity,
data distribution, and the presence of CoT supervision. We also uncover a
transient trace unfaithfulness phase: early in training, models often produce
correct answers while skipping or contradicting CoT steps, before later
aligning their reasoning traces with answers. Empirically, we (1) demonstrate
that CoT accelerates generalization but does not overcome tasks with higher
algorithmic complexity, such as finding list intersections; (2) introduce a
kinetic modeling framework for understanding transformer learning; (3)
characterize trace faithfulness as a dynamic property that emerges over
training; and (4) show CoT alters internal transformer computation
mechanistically.

*Muhammad Faraz Ul Abrar,Nicolò Michelusi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文研究了在无线异构环境下基于随机梯度下降的空中联邦学习，提出了允许结构化模型偏差的新更新方法，并开发了优化偏差-方差权衡的功率控制算法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有OTA-FL设计在异构无线场景下受限于最弱设备且会增大更新方差，同时先前对偏差OTA-FL的分析主要针对凸目标，而现代AI模型大多是非凸的。

Method: 开发了允许结构化、时不变模型偏差的OTA-FL SGD更新方法，提出了非凸联合OTA功率控制设计，并使用连续凸逼近算法进行优化。

Result: 实验验证了SCA设计通过优化偏差加速收敛，并在非凸图像分类任务上相比现有OTA-FL基线提高了泛化性能。

Conclusion: 本文提出的方法在异构无线环境下有效优化了偏差-方差权衡，提升了OTA-FL的性能和收敛速度。

Abstract: Over-the-air (OTA) federated learning (FL) has been well recognized as a
scalable paradigm that exploits the waveform superposition of the wireless
multiple-access channel to aggregate model updates in a single use. Existing
OTA-FL designs largely enforce zero-bias model updates by either assuming
\emph{homogeneous} wireless conditions (equal path loss across devices) or
forcing zero-bias updates to guarantee convergence. Under \emph{heterogeneous}
wireless scenarios, however, such designs are constrained by the weakest device
and inflate the update variance. Moreover, prior analyses of biased OTA-FL
largely address convex objectives, while most modern AI models are highly
non-convex. Motivated by these gaps, we study OTA-FL with stochastic gradient
descent (SGD) for general smooth non-convex objectives under wireless
heterogeneity. We develop novel OTA-FL SGD updates that allow a structured,
time-invariant model bias while facilitating reduced variance updates. We
derive a finite-time stationarity bound (expected time average squared gradient
norm) that explicitly reveals a bias-variance trade-off. To optimize this
trade-off, we pose a non-convex joint OTA power-control design and develop an
efficient successive convex approximation (SCA) algorithm that requires only
statistical CSI at the base station. Experiments on a non-convex image
classification task validate the approach: the SCA-based design accelerates
convergence via an optimized bias and improves generalization over prior OTA-FL
baselines.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一个理论框架来分析多智能体系统中的系统偏差，引入了可学习性比率概念，并开发了ABLOC算法来自适应学习偏差校正，证明了性能改进受限于可学习性比率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代多智能体系统（如传感器网络、众包平台）因环境条件变化导致的系统偏差而性能下降，现有方法要么忽略偏差导致次优决策，要么需要昂贵的校准程序。

Method: 开发理论框架将偏差分解为可学习的系统成分和不可约的随机成分，引入可学习性比率概念，提出ABLOC算法迭代学习偏差校正变换并优化组合权重。

Result: 实验验证显示高可学习性比率的系统可恢复显著性能（达到理论最大改进的40%-70%），而低可学习性系统收益甚微。

Conclusion: 系统性能改进根本上受限于可学习性比率，为系统设计者提供了何时投资偏差学习与采用简单方法的定量指导。

Abstract: Modern multi-agent systems ranging from sensor networks monitoring critical
infrastructure to crowdsourcing platforms aggregating human intelligence can
suffer significant performance degradation due to systematic biases that vary
with environmental conditions. Current approaches either ignore these biases,
leading to suboptimal decisions, or require expensive calibration procedures
that are often infeasible in practice. This performance gap has real
consequences: inaccurate environmental monitoring, unreliable financial
predictions, and flawed aggregation of human judgments. This paper addresses
the fundamental question: when can we learn and correct for these unknown
biases to recover near-optimal performance, and when is such learning futile?
We develop a theoretical framework that decomposes biases into learnable
systematic components and irreducible stochastic components, introducing the
concept of learnability ratio as the fraction of bias variance predictable from
observable covariates. This ratio determines whether bias learning is
worthwhile for a given system. We prove that the achievable performance
improvement is fundamentally bounded by this learnability ratio, providing
system designers with quantitative guidance on when to invest in bias learning
versus simpler approaches. We present the Adaptive Bias Learning and Optimal
Combining (ABLOC) algorithm, which iteratively learns bias-correcting
transformations while optimizing combination weights through closedform
solutions, guaranteeing convergence to these theoretical bounds. Experimental
validation demonstrates that systems with high learnability ratios can recover
significant performance (we achieved 40%-70% of theoretical maximum improvement
in our examples), while those with low learnability show minimal benefit,
validating our diagnostic criteria for practical deployment decisions.

*Farnoosh Namdarpour,Joseph Y. J. Chow*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于模拟的强化学习方法来解决拼车系统中的短视决策问题，通过嵌入拼车模拟实现非短视决策，并提出了空闲车辆再平衡策略，显著提高了服务率和减少了等待时间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 拼车服务虽然能降低成本、缓解拥堵和环境问题，但其决策过程通常是短视的，忽视了调度决策的长期影响。

Method: 将Xu等人(2018)的学习和规划框架从网约车扩展到拼车系统，在learning机制中嵌入拼车模拟以实现非短视决策，并提出了空闲车辆再平衡策略，使用n步时序差分学习从模拟经验中学习时空状态值。

Result: 非短视匹配策略相比短视策略可将服务率提高8.4%，同时减少乘客车内和等待时间；相比短视策略可减少25%以上的车队规模而保持相同性能水平；结合再平衡操作可将等待时间减少27.3%，车内时间减少12.5%，服务率提高15.1%。

Conclusion: 所提出的非短视策略能显著提高拼车系统的性能，为运营商提供显著的成本节约，同时结合再平衡操作能进一步优化系统表现，尽管会增加每乘客的车辆行驶时间。

Abstract: Ride-pooling, also known as ride-sharing, shared ride-hailing, or
microtransit, is a service wherein passengers share rides. This service can
reduce costs for both passengers and operators and reduce congestion and
environmental impacts. A key limitation, however, is its myopic
decision-making, which overlooks long-term effects of dispatch decisions. To
address this, we propose a simulation-informed reinforcement learning (RL)
approach. While RL has been widely studied in the context of ride-hailing
systems, its application in ride-pooling systems has been less explored. In
this study, we extend the learning and planning framework of Xu et al. (2018)
from ride-hailing to ride-pooling by embedding a ride-pooling simulation within
the learning mechanism to enable non-myopic decision-making. In addition, we
propose a complementary policy for rebalancing idle vehicles. By employing
n-step temporal difference learning on simulated experiences, we derive
spatiotemporal state values and subsequently evaluate the effectiveness of the
non-myopic policy using NYC taxi request data. Results demonstrate that the
non-myopic policy for matching can increase the service rate by up to 8.4%
versus a myopic policy while reducing both in-vehicle and wait times for
passengers. Furthermore, the proposed non-myopic policy can decrease fleet size
by over 25% compared to a myopic policy, while maintaining the same level of
performance, thereby offering significant cost savings for operators.
Incorporating rebalancing operations into the proposed framework cuts wait time
by up to 27.3%, in-vehicle time by 12.5%, and raises service rate by 15.1%
compared to using the framework for matching decisions alone at the cost of
increased vehicle minutes traveled per passenger.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MemEIC是一种用于大型视觉语言模型(LVLMs)的持续组合知识编辑方法，支持视觉和文本知识的顺序组合编辑，通过混合外部-内部编辑器和双LoRA适配器实现跨模态知识更新。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有知识编辑方法通常只关注单一模态（视觉或语言），忽略了LVLMs的多模态特性和知识更新的连续性，导致编辑效果不佳。

Method: 采用混合外部-内部编辑器，包含双外部记忆用于跨模态证据检索，双LoRA适配器实现各模态的解耦参数更新，以及受大脑启发的知识连接器用于组合推理。

Result: 实验表明MemEIC在复杂多模态问题上显著提升性能，并能有效保留先前的编辑结果，为LVLMs的持续组合知识编辑设立了新基准。

Conclusion: MemEIC通过支持视觉和文本知识的组合编辑，解决了多模态知识编辑中的连续性和组合性问题，为LVLMs的知识更新提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: The dynamic nature of information necessitates continuously updating large
vision-language models (LVLMs). While recent knowledge editing techniques hint
at promising directions, they often focus on editing a single modality (vision
or language) in isolation. This prevalent practice neglects the inherent
multimodality of LVLMs and the continuous nature of knowledge updates,
potentially leading to suboptimal editing outcomes when considering the
interplay between modalities and the need for ongoing knowledge refinement. To
address these limitations, we propose MemEIC, a novel method for Continual and
Compositional Knowledge Editing (CCKE) in LVLMs. MemEIC enables compositional
editing of both visual and textual knowledge sequentially. Our approach employs
a hybrid external-internal editor featuring a dual external memory for
cross-modal evidence retrieval and dual LoRA adapters that facilitate
disentangled parameter updates for each modality. A key component is a
brain-inspired knowledge connector, activated selectively for compositional
reasoning, that integrates information across different modalities. Experiments
demonstrate that MemEIC significantly improves performance on complex
multimodal questions and effectively preserves prior edits, setting a new
benchmark for CCKE in LVLMs.

TL;DR: 本文研究了时间序列预测中的频谱偏差现象，发现几乎所有主流模型都存在此现象，并提出FreLE算法通过频率正则化来缓解该问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 时间序列数据的自相关性给多变量时间序列预测带来挑战，现有研究虽然注意到神经网络中的频谱偏差现象，但往往将其归因于特定架构设计，而非模型的普遍特性。

Method: 通过大量实证实验测量主流模型的频谱偏差，并提出FreLE算法，这是一种即插即用的模型损失函数单元，通过显式和隐式频率正则化来增强模型泛化能力。

Result: 实验证明几乎所有模型都表现出频谱偏差现象，而FreLE算法在各种实验中表现出优越性能。

Conclusion: 频谱偏差是时间序列预测模型的普遍特性，FreLE算法能有效缓解该问题，提升模型性能。

Abstract: The inherent autocorrelation of time series data presents an ongoing
challenge to multivariate time series prediction. Recently, a widely adopted
approach has been the incorporation of frequency domain information to assist
in long-term prediction tasks. Many researchers have independently observed the
spectral bias phenomenon in neural networks, where models tend to fit
low-frequency signals before high-frequency ones. However, these observations
have often been attributed to the specific architectures designed by the
researchers, rather than recognizing the phenomenon as a universal
characteristic across models. To unify the understanding of the spectral bias
phenomenon in long-term time series prediction, we conducted extensive
empirical experiments to measure spectral bias in existing mainstream models.
Our findings reveal that virtually all models exhibit this phenomenon. To
mitigate the impact of spectral bias, we propose the FreLE (Frequency Loss
Enhancement) algorithm, which enhances model generalization through both
explicit and implicit frequency regularization. This is a plug-and-play model
loss function unit. A large number of experiments have proven the superior
performance of FreLE. Code is available at

TL;DR: 提出SPECS框架，通过自蒸馏生成偏好数据对，使用偏好训练方法进行冷启动，优于传统的SFT方法，在多模态基准测试中取得显著性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统SFT冷启动方法将推理范式与任务解决方案和输出格式交织在一起，可能导致指令风格过拟合，削弱分布外泛化能力，并影响下游强化学习。

Method: SPECS框架：1) 通过自蒸馏生成内省偏好数据对；2) 进行偏好训练，专注于浅层、可转移的表面形式标准；3) 转交给具有可验证奖励的RL进行深度推理。

Result: 在多个多模态基准测试中，MEGA-Bench提升4.1%，MathVista提升12.2%，减少分布内"停滞"，改善探索，稳定训练，提高性能上限。

Conclusion: 偏好训练方法在冷启动中比SFT方法泛化更好，提出的解耦学习框架通过分离多模态学习实现了性能的持续提升。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) with verifiable rewards has recently catalyzed a
wave of "MLLM-r1" approaches that bring RL to vision language models. Most
representative paradigms begin with a cold start, typically employing
supervised fine-tuning (SFT), to initialize the policy before RL. However,
SFT-based cold start adopts the reasoning paradigm intertwined with task
solution and output format, which may induce instruction-style overfitting,
weakens out-of-distribution generalization, and ultimately affects downstream
RL. We revisit the cold start along two views, its training method and data
construction, and introduce the Generalization Factor (GF) coefficient to
quantify the generalization capability under different methods. Our empirical
study finds that preference-based training methods (e.g. DPO) generalizes
better than SFT-based methods in cold start. Motivated by this, we propose
SPECS-a Self-distilled, Preference-based Cold Start framework that decouples
multimodal learning: (1) generates introspective preference data pairs via
self-distillation, avoiding reliance on larger teachers or manual annotation;
(2) performs preference-based training to learn, focusing on shallow,
transferable surface-form criteria (format, structure, style) rather than
memorizing content; and (3) hands off to RL with verifiable rewards for deep
reasoning results. Experimental results across multiple multimodal benchmarks
show that our decoupling learning framework yields consistent performance gains
over strong baselines, improving MEGA-Bench by 4.1% and MathVista by 12.2%.
Additional experiments indicate that SPECS contributes to reducing
in-distribution "stuckness," improving exploration, stabilizing training, and
raising the performance ceiling.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了MoE-POT模型，一种稀疏激活的专家混合架构，用于解决PDE预训练中的数据集异构性和推理成本问题。该模型通过路由门控网络动态选择专家，在控制推理成本的同时提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决PDE预训练中的两个关键挑战：1）PDE数据集在方程类型上的异构性导致混合训练误差高；2）密集预训练模型通过增加网络宽度或深度来扩展参数会带来显著的推理成本。

Method: 提出Mixture-of-Experts Pre-training Operator Transformer (MoE-POT)，采用层间路由门控网络从16个专家网络中动态选择4个路由专家，同时集成2个共享专家来捕获PDE的共性特征。最终输出是所有激活专家结果的加权平均。

Result: 在6个公共PDE数据集上预训练了参数规模从30M到0.5B的模型。90M激活参数的模型在零样本误差上比现有120M激活参数模型降低了40%。可解释性分析显示可以从路由门控网络决策推断数据集类型。

Conclusion: MoE-POT架构能够有效控制推理成本，同时通过动态专家选择机制提升模型性能，验证了MoE架构在PDE预训练中的合理性和有效性。

Abstract: Pre-training has proven effective in addressing data scarcity and performance
limitations in solving PDE problems with neural operators. However, challenges
remain due to the heterogeneity of PDE datasets in equation types, which leads
to high errors in mixed training. Additionally, dense pre-training models that
scale parameters by increasing network width or depth incur significant
inference costs. To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel
Mixture-of-Experts Pre-training Operator Transformer (MoE-POT), a
sparse-activated architecture that scales parameters efficiently while
controlling inference costs. Specifically, our model adopts a layer-wise
router-gating network to dynamically select 4 routed experts from 16 expert
networks during inference, enabling the model to focus on equation-specific
features. Meanwhile, we also integrate 2 shared experts, aiming to capture
common properties of PDE and reduce redundancy among routed experts. The final
output is computed as the weighted average of the results from all activated
experts. We pre-train models with parameters from 30M to 0.5B on 6 public PDE
datasets. Our model with 90M activated parameters achieves up to a 40%
reduction in zero-shot error compared with existing models with 120M activated
parameters. Additionally, we conduct interpretability analysis, showing that
dataset types can be inferred from router-gating network decisions, which
validates the rationality and effectiveness of the MoE architecture.

TL;DR: PRESTO是一个针对黑盒大语言模型的指令优化框架，通过利用软提示的preimage结构来提高优化效率，在相同查询预算下获得14倍评分数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 黑盒LLMs的指令优化面临效率问题，现有方法使用白盒LLMs从优化软提示生成候选指令，但存在多对一映射导致冗余查询。

Method: PRESTO包含三个关键组件：评分共享、基于preimage的初始化、评分一致性正则化，利用preimage结构实现高效优化。

Result: 在33个指令优化任务上的实验结果表明PRESTO具有优越性能，在相同查询预算下有效获得14倍评分数据。

Conclusion: PRESTO证明了将多对一映射重新解释为有用先验知识可以加速优化，为黑盒LLMs指令优化提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success across diverse
domains, due to their strong instruction-following capabilities. This has led
to increasing interest in optimizing instructions for black-box LLMs, whose
internal parameters are inaccessible but widely used due to their strong
performance. To optimize instructions for black-box LLMs, recent methods employ
white-box LLMs to generate candidate instructions from optimized soft prompts.
However, white-box LLMs often map different soft prompts to the same
instruction, leading to redundant queries. While previous studies regarded this
many-to-one mapping as a structure that hinders optimization efficiency, we
reinterpret it as a useful prior knowledge that can accelerate the
optimization. To this end, we introduce PREimage-informed inSTruction
Optimization (PRESTO), a novel framework that leverages the preimage structure
of soft prompts for efficient optimization. PRESTO consists of three key
components: (1) score sharing, which shares the evaluation score with all soft
prompts in a preimage; (2) preimage-based initialization, which selects initial
data points that maximize search space coverage using preimage information; and
(3) score consistency regularization, which enforces prediction consistency
within each preimage. By leveraging preimages, PRESTO achieves the effect of
effectively obtaining 14 times more scored data under the same query budget,
resulting in more efficient optimization. Experimental results on 33
instruction optimization tasks demonstrate the superior performance of PRESTO.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 文本到图像扩散模型在生成超出训练分辨率的图像时性能下降，现有无需训练的方法要么计算量大，要么与最新的Diffusion Transformer模型不兼容。

Method: 提出Neighborhood Patch Attention(NPA)减少自注意力层计算冗余，结合SDEdit流程和Latent Frequency Mixing(LFM)生成细节，使用Structure Guidance增强去噪过程中的全局结构。

Result: 在U-Net和Diffusion Transformer架构上，ScaleDiff在图像质量和推理速度方面都达到了无需训练方法的最先进水平。

Conclusion: ScaleDiff是一个模型无关的高效框架，能够无需额外训练扩展预训练扩散模型的分辨率，在性能和速度上都表现出色。

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models often exhibit degraded performance when
generating images beyond their training resolution. Recent training-free
methods can mitigate this limitation, but they often require substantial
computation or are incompatible with recent Diffusion Transformer models. In
this paper, we propose ScaleDiff, a model-agnostic and highly efficient
framework for extending the resolution of pretrained diffusion models without
any additional training. A core component of our framework is Neighborhood
Patch Attention (NPA), an efficient mechanism that reduces computational
redundancy in the self-attention layer with non-overlapping patches. We
integrate NPA into an SDEdit pipeline and introduce Latent Frequency Mixing
(LFM) to better generate fine details. Furthermore, we apply Structure Guidance
to enhance global structure during the denoising process. Experimental results
demonstrate that ScaleDiff achieves state-of-the-art performance among
training-free methods in terms of both image quality and inference speed on
both U-Net and Diffusion Transformer architectures.

TL;DR: 提出了MedVLSynther框架，从开放生物医学文献中自动生成高质量的多选题视觉问答数据，解决了医疗VQA系统训练数据缺乏的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型多模态模型在医疗视觉问答方面能力增强，但缺乏大规模、开放可用、高质量的医疗VQA训练数据阻碍了通用医疗VQA系统的发展。

Method: 采用生成器-验证器框架，从PubMed Central中基于图像、标题和文本引用生成多选题VQA项目，生成器产生自包含题干和互斥选项，多阶段验证器确保质量。

Result: 生成了MedSynVQA数据集：13,087个审核问题覆盖14,803张图像，涉及13种成像模式和28个解剖区域。训练的开源LMM在6个医疗VQA基准上表现优异，准确率最高达77.57%。

Conclusion: MedVLSynther提供了一条可审计、可复现且保护隐私的路径，用于生成可扩展的医疗VQA训练数据，完全基于开放文献和开源模型。

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) are increasingly capable of answering medical
questions that require joint reasoning over images and text, yet training
general medical VQA systems is impeded by the lack of large, openly usable,
high-quality corpora. We present MedVLSynther, a rubric-guided
generator-verifier framework that synthesizes high-quality multiple-choice VQA
items directly from open biomedical literature by conditioning on figures,
captions, and in-text references. The generator produces self-contained stems
and parallel, mutually exclusive options under a machine-checkable JSON schema;
a multi-stage verifier enforces essential gates (self-containment, single
correct answer, clinical validity, image-text consistency), awards fine-grained
positive points, and penalizes common failure modes before acceptance. Applying
this pipeline to PubMed Central yields MedSynVQA: 13,087 audited questions over
14,803 images spanning 13 imaging modalities and 28 anatomical regions.
Training open-weight LMMs with reinforcement learning using verifiable rewards
improves accuracy across six medical VQA benchmarks, achieving averages of
55.85 (3B) and 58.15 (7B), with up to 77.57 on VQA-RAD and 67.76 on PathVQA,
outperforming strong medical LMMs. A Ablations verify that both generation and
verification are necessary and that more verified data consistently helps, and
a targeted contamination analysis detects no leakage from evaluation suites. By
operating entirely on open literature and open-weight models, MedVLSynther
offers an auditable, reproducible, and privacy-preserving path to scalable
medical VQA training data.

TL;DR: πRL框架通过两种强化学习算法解决了基于流的VLA模型在大规模RL训练中的挑战，显著提升了模型在机器人任务中的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决基于流的VLA模型在大规模强化学习中由于迭代去噪过程导致动作对数似然难以计算的问题。

Method: 提出πRL框架，包含两种RL算法：Flow-Noise将去噪过程建模为离散时间MDP，Flow-SDE通过ODE到SDE转换实现高效探索。

Result: 在LIBERO基准上，将π0和π0.5模型的性能分别从57.6%提升到97.6%和从77.1%提升到98.3%；在ManiSkill基准上，在4352个拾放任务中分别从41.6%提升到85.7%和从40.0%提升到84.8%。

Conclusion: πRL框架通过在线强化学习显著提升了基于流的VLA模型的性能和泛化能力，证明了RL方法对该类模型的有效性。

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models enable robots to understand and perform
complex tasks from multimodal input. Although recent work explores using
reinforcement learning (RL) to automate the laborious data collection process
in scaling supervised fine-tuning (SFT), applying large-scale RL to flow-based
VLAs (e.g., $\pi_0$, $\pi_{0.5}$) remains challenging due to intractable action
log-likelihoods from iterative denoising.
  We address this challenge with $\pi_{\text{RL}}$, an open-source framework
for training flow-based VLAs in parallel simulation. $\pi_{\text{RL}}$
implements two RL algorithms: (1) {Flow-Noise} models the denoising process as
a discrete-time MDP with a learnable noise network for exact log-likelihood
computation. (2) {Flow-SDE} integrates denoising with agent-environment
interaction, formulating a two-layer MDP that employs ODE-to-SDE conversion for
efficient RL exploration.
  We evaluate $\pi_{\text{RL}}$ on LIBERO and ManiSkill benchmarks. On LIBERO,
$\pi_{\text{RL}}$ boosts few-shot SFT models $\pi_0$ and $\pi_{0.5}$ from 57.6%
to 97.6% and from 77.1% to 98.3%, respectively. In ManiSkill, we train
$\pi_{\text{RL}}$ in 320 parallel environments, improving $\pi_0$ from 41.6% to
85.7% and $\pi_{0.5}$ from 40.0% to 84.8% across 4352 pick-and-place tasks,
demonstrating scalable multitask RL under heterogeneous simulation.
  Overall, $\pi_{\text{RL}}$ achieves significant performance gains and
stronger generalization over SFT-models, validating the effectiveness of online
RL for flow-based VLAs.

Abstract: We propose a graph-topological approach to active learning that directly
targets the core challenge of exploration versus exploitation under scarce
label budgets. To guide exploration, we introduce a coreset construction
algorithm based on Balanced Forman Curvature (BFC), which selects
representative initial labels that reflect the graph's cluster structure. This
method includes a data-driven stopping criterion that signals when the graph
has been sufficiently explored. We further use BFC to dynamically trigger the
shift from exploration to exploitation within active learning routines,
replacing hand-tuned heuristics. To improve exploitation, we introduce a
localized graph rewiring strategy that efficiently incorporates multiscale
information around labeled nodes, enhancing label propagation while preserving
sparsity. Experiments on benchmark classification tasks show that our methods
consistently outperform existing graph-based semi-supervised baselines at low
label rates.

Abstract: We consider the problem of estimating a causal effect in a multi-domain
setting. The causal effect of interest is confounded by an unobserved
confounder and can change between the different domains. We assume that we have
access to a proxy of the hidden confounder and that all variables are discrete
or categorical. We propose methodology to estimate the causal effect in the
target domain, where we assume to observe only the proxy variable. Under these
conditions, we prove identifiability (even when treatment and response
variables are continuous). We introduce two estimation techniques, prove
consistency, and derive confidence intervals. The theoretical results are
supported by simulation studies and a real-world example studying the causal
effect of website rankings on consumer choices.

Motivation: 现有主动学习方法在处理混乱、未整理的数据池时效果有限，因为它们依赖固定的无监督表示，无法捕捉与目标任务相关的信息。

Conclusion: 任务驱动的动态表示能更有效地处理混乱数据池，提高主动学习的效果。

Abstract: Active learning has the potential to be especially useful for messy,
uncurated pools where datapoints vary in relevance to the target task. However,
state-of-the-art approaches to this problem currently rely on using fixed,
unsupervised representations of the pool, focusing on modifying the acquisition
function instead. We show that this model setup can undermine their
effectiveness at dealing with messy pools, as such representations can fail to
capture important information relevant to the task. To address this, we propose
using task-driven representations that are periodically updated during the
active learning process using the previously collected labels. We introduce two
specific strategies for learning these representations, one based on directly
learning semi-supervised representations and the other based on supervised

*Jipeng Li,Yannning Shen*

TL;DR: 提出InvGNN-WM方法，通过图不变量的隐式感知实现无触发器的黑盒水印验证，在保持任务性能的同时提供强健的所有权保护。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有GNN水印方法依赖后门触发器，容易受到常见模型编辑的影响并产生所有权模糊问题，需要更鲁棒的水印方案。

Method: 使用轻量级头预测所有者私有载体集上的归一化代数连通性，通过符号敏感解码器输出比特，并用校准阈值控制误报率。

Result: 在多种节点和图分类数据集及骨干网络上，InvGNN-WM保持清洁准确率的同时，水印准确率高于基于触发器和压缩的基线方法。

Conclusion: 该方法在非结构化剪枝、微调和训练后量化下保持强健，知识蒸馏会削弱水印但结合水印损失可恢复，证明了不可感知性和鲁棒性保证，且精确移除是NP完全问题。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are valuable intellectual property, yet many
watermarks rely on backdoor triggers that break under common model edits and
create ownership ambiguity. We present InvGNN-WM, which ties ownership to a
model's implicit perception of a graph invariant, enabling trigger-free,
black-box verification with negligible task impact. A lightweight head predicts
normalized algebraic connectivity on an owner-private carrier set; a
sign-sensitive decoder outputs bits, and a calibrated threshold controls the
false-positive rate. Across diverse node and graph classification datasets and
backbones, InvGNN-WM matches clean accuracy while yielding higher watermark
accuracy than trigger- and compression-based baselines. It remains strong under
unstructured pruning, fine-tuning, and post-training quantization; plain
knowledge distillation (KD) weakens the mark, while KD with a watermark loss
(KD+WM) restores it. We provide guarantees for imperceptibility and robustness,
and we prove that exact removal is NP-complete.

TL;DR: MLT是一种可逆且确定性的高基数分类标识符编码技术，通过模运算和可逆线性变换将分类标识符转换为紧凑数值向量，保持双射映射关系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统哈希或独热编码方法无法保持双射映射关系，MLT旨在提供一种既能保持完全可逆性又能控制维度的编码方法。

Method: 利用有限域上的模运算和可逆线性变换，实现分类标识符到数值向量的编码，支持维度控制和计算可扩展性。

Result: 在MovieLens 20M数据集上的实验表明，MLT在预测性能上与监督嵌入方法相当，但参数数量和训练成本显著降低。

Conclusion: MLT是一种高效的可逆编码方法，适用于大规模分类标识符处理，已在PyPI和GitHub开源。

Abstract: This paper introduces Modular Linear Tokenization (MLT), a reversible and
deterministic technique for encoding high-cardinality categorical identifiers
into compact numerical vectors. Unlike traditional hashing or one-hot
encodings, MLT preserves bijective mappings by leveraging modular arithmetic
over finite fields and invertible linear transformations. The method offers
explicit control of dimensionality and computational scalability while
maintaining full reversibility, even for millions of identifiers. Experimental
results on the MovieLens 20M dataset show that MLT achieves comparable
predictive performance to supervised embeddings while requiring significantly
fewer parameters and lower training cost. An open-source implementation of MLT
is available on PyPI (https://pypi.org/project/light-mlt/) and GitHub
(https://github.com/tcharliesschmitz/light-mlt).

TL;DR: 该研究评估了三种地理基础模型嵌入源在马拉维预测15项常规健康指标的表现，发现多源GeoFM模型相比传统地理统计方法在87%的指标上有改进。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 低收入和中等收入国家的常规健康数据存在报告延迟和覆盖不完整的问题，需要探索新的数据源和分析方法来提高可靠性。

Method: 使用XGBoost模型，基于552个健康服务区的数据，比较Google PDFM、AlphaEarth和移动电话CDR三种GeoFM嵌入源与传统地理插值方法的预测性能。

Result: 基于嵌入的方法在15个指标中的13个优于基线方法。多源GeoFM模型表现最稳健，在人口密度、新HIV病例和儿童疫苗接种等指标上取得较好预测效果。

Conclusion: 多源GeoFM整合是补充和加强受限常规健康信息系统的有效且有价值的工具。

Abstract: The reliability of routine health data in low and middle-income countries
(LMICs) is often constrained by reporting delays and incomplete coverage,
necessitating the exploration of novel data sources and analytics. Geospatial
Foundation Models (GeoFMs) offer a promising avenue by synthesizing diverse
spatial, temporal, and behavioral data into mathematical embeddings that can be
efficiently used for downstream prediction tasks. This study evaluated the
predictive performance of three GeoFM embedding sources - Google Population
Dynamics Foundation Model (PDFM), Google AlphaEarth (derived from satellite
imagery), and mobile phone call detail records (CDR) - for modeling 15 routine
health programmatic outputs in Malawi, and compared their utility to
traditional geospatial interpolation methods. We used XGBoost models on data
from 552 health catchment areas (January 2021-May 2023), assessing performance
with R2, and using an 80/20 training and test data split with 5-fold
cross-validation used in training. While predictive performance was mixed, the
embedding-based approaches improved upon baseline geostatistical methods in 13
of 15 (87%) indicators tested. A Multi-GeoFM model integrating all three
embedding sources produced the most robust predictions, achieving average
5-fold cross validated R2 values for indicators like population density (0.63),
new HIV cases (0.57), and child vaccinations (0.47) and test set R2 of 0.64,
0.68, and 0.55, respectively. Prediction was poor for prediction targets with
low primary data availability, such as TB and malnutrition cases. These results
demonstrate that GeoFM embeddings imbue a modest predictive improvement for
select health and demographic outcomes in an LMIC context. We conclude that the
integration of multiple GeoFM sources is an efficient and valuable tool for
supplementing and strengthening constrained routine health information systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 该研究动机源于两个关键因素：(i) 数据驱动学习方法在某些领域（如组合优化）仍不成熟且结果有限；(ii) 训练数据获取受限（如医学图像重建等科学应用）。

Method: 定义了无数据设置，并根据问题实例如何编码到神经网络中将其分为两类：(i) 架构无关方法和(ii) 架构特定方法。

Result: 虽然多层感知机几十年前已用于解决线性规划问题，但这种方法最近因在组合优化、逆问题和偏微分方程等多样化应用中展现出有前景的结果而受到关注。

Conclusion: 本文讨论了无数据神经网络设置与相关概念（如零样本学习、单样本学习、优化中的提升和过参数化）的相似性和区别。

Abstract: This paper surveys studies on the use of neural networks for optimization in
the training-data-free setting. Specifically, we examine the dataless
application of neural network architectures in optimization by
re-parameterizing problems using fully connected (or MLP), convolutional,
graph, and quadratic neural networks. Although MLPs have been used to solve
linear programs a few decades ago, this approach has recently gained increasing
attention due to its promising results across diverse applications, including
those based on combinatorial optimization, inverse problems, and partial
differential equations. The motivation for this setting stems from two key
(possibly over-lapping) factors: (i) data-driven learning approaches are still
underdeveloped and have yet to demonstrate strong results, as seen in
combinatorial optimization, and (ii) the availability of training data is
inherently limited, such as in medical image reconstruction and other
scientific applications. In this paper, we define the dataless setting and
categorize it into two variants based on how a problem instance -- defined by a
single datum -- is encoded onto the neural network: (i) architecture-agnostic
methods and (ii) architecture-specific methods. Additionally, we discuss
similarities and clarify distinctions between the dataless neural network (dNN)
settings and related concepts such as zero-shot learning, one-shot learning,
lifting in optimization, and over-parameterization.

TL;DR: 本文指出InfoNCE不是有效的互信息估计器，提出了InfoNCE-anchor改进方法，通过引入辅助锚点类实现一致的密度比估计，显著减少偏差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管InfoNCE在对比表示学习中很流行，但它与互信息的间接联系使其不适合作为有效的MI估计器，需要更准确的估计方法。

Method: 引入辅助锚点类进行密度比估计，使用适当的评分规则框架统一各种对比目标，包括NCE、InfoNCE和f-散度变体。

Result: InfoNCE-anchor在log评分下获得最准确的MI估计，但在自监督表示学习中，锚点并未改善下游任务性能。

Conclusion: 对比表示学习的优势不在于准确的MI估计本身，而在于学习结构化的密度比。

Abstract: The InfoNCE objective, originally introduced for contrastive representation
learning, has become a popular choice for mutual information (MI) estimation,
despite its indirect connection to MI. In this paper, we demonstrate why
InfoNCE should not be regarded as a valid MI estimator, and we introduce a
simple modification, which we refer to as InfoNCE-anchor, for accurate MI
estimation. Our modification introduces an auxiliary anchor class, enabling
consistent density ratio estimation and yielding a plug-in MI estimator with
significantly reduced bias. Beyond this, we generalize our framework using
proper scoring rules, which recover InfoNCE-anchor as a special case when the
log score is employed. This formulation unifies a broad spectrum of contrastive
objectives, including NCE, InfoNCE, and $f$-divergence variants, under a single
principled framework. Empirically, we find that InfoNCE-anchor with the log
score achieves the most accurate MI estimates; however, in self-supervised
representation learning experiments, we find that the anchor does not improve
the downstream task performance. These findings corroborate that contrastive
representation learning benefits not from accurate MI estimation per se, but
from the learning of structured density ratios.

Conclusion: 可微分优化可以作为实验、学习、校准和设计的常规工具，无需偏离标准JuMP建模实践，同时保持对广泛求解器生态系统的访问。

Abstract: Differentiating through constrained optimization problems is increasingly
central to learning, control, and large-scale decision-making systems, yet
practical integration remains challenging due to solver specialization and
interface mismatches. This paper presents a general and streamlined
framework-an updated DiffOpt.jl-that unifies modeling and differentiation
within the Julia optimization stack. The framework computes forward - and
reverse-mode solution and objective sensitivities for smooth, potentially
nonconvex programs by differentiating the KKT system under standard regularity
assumptions. A first-class, JuMP-native parameter-centric API allows users to
declare named parameters and obtain derivatives directly with respect to them -
even when a parameter appears in multiple constraints and objectives -
eliminating brittle bookkeeping from coefficient-level interfaces. We
illustrate these capabilities on convex and nonconvex models, including
economic dispatch, mean-variance portfolio selection with conic risk
constraints, and nonlinear robot inverse kinematics. Two companion studies
further demonstrate impact at scale: gradient-based iterative methods for
strategic bidding in energy markets and Sobolev-style training of end-to-end
optimization proxies using solver-accurate sensitivities. Together, these
results demonstrate that differentiable optimization can be deployed as a
routine tool for experimentation, learning, calibration, and design-without
deviating from standard JuMP modeling practices and while retaining access to a
broad ecosystem of solvers.

Motivation: 边缘机器人系统需要高效的在线学习算法，传统反向传播不符合生物合理性原则，预测编码(PC)框架虽然生物合理但计算开销大。

Method: 提出预测编码网络与时间摊销(PCN-TA)，通过跨时间帧保留潜在状态，利用时间相关性减少计算需求。

Result: 在COIL-20机器人感知数据集上，PCN-TA比反向传播减少10%权重更新，比基线PC网络减少50%推理步骤。

Conclusion: PCN-TA显著降低计算开销，为边缘部署和实时适应提供支持，是未来神经形态硬件实现的有前景候选方案。

Abstract: Robotic systems operating at the edge require efficient online learning
algorithms that can continuously adapt to changing environments while
processing streaming sensory data. Traditional backpropagation, while
effective, conflicts with biological plausibility principles and may be
suboptimal for continuous adaptation scenarios. The Predictive Coding (PC)
framework offers a biologically plausible alternative with local, Hebbian-like
update rules, making it suitable for neuromorphic hardware implementation.
However, PC's main limitation is its computational overhead due to multiple
inference iterations during training. We present Predictive Coding Network with
Temporal Amortization (PCN-TA), which preserves latent states across temporal
frames. By leveraging temporal correlations, PCN-TA significantly reduces
computational demands while maintaining learning performance. Our experiments
on the COIL-20 robotic perception dataset demonstrate that PCN-TA achieves 10%
fewer weight updates compared to backpropagation and requires 50% fewer
inference steps than baseline PC networks. These efficiency gains directly
translate to reduced computational overhead for moving another step toward edge
deployment and real-time adaptation support in resource-constrained robotic
systems. The biologically-inspired nature of our approach also makes it a
promising candidate for future neuromorphic hardware implementations, enabling
efficient online learning at the edge.

Motivation: 解决完全自适应探索方法（如UCB和Thompson Sampling）需要频繁探索与纯贪婪方法需要严格多样性假设之间的差距，适用于安全关键或成本高昂的领域

Method: INFEX框架按预定调度执行基础探索策略，在探索间隔期间主要选择贪婪动作，是一个通用模块化框架

Result: 理论分析表明，只要探索频率超过对数阈值，INFEX就能实现与标准高效算法相匹配的实例相关遗憾

Conclusion: INFEX在保持理论性能的同时显著减少探索频率，提高了计算效率，实证评估证实了其优越性能

Abstract: We study the problem of infrequent exploration in linear bandits, addressing
a significant yet overlooked gap between fully adaptive exploratory methods
(e.g., UCB and Thompson Sampling), which explore potentially at every time
step, and purely greedy approaches, which require stringent diversity
assumptions to succeed. Continuous exploration can be impractical or unethical
in safety-critical or costly domains, while purely greedy strategies typically
fail without adequate contextual diversity. To bridge these extremes, we
introduce a simple and practical framework, INFEX, explicitly designed for
infrequent exploration. INFEX executes a base exploratory policy according to a
given schedule while predominantly choosing greedy actions in between. Despite
its simplicity, our theoretical analysis demonstrates that INFEX achieves
instance-dependent regret matching standard provably efficient algorithms,
provided the exploration frequency exceeds a logarithmic threshold.
Additionally, INFEX is a general, modular framework that allows seamless
integration of any fully adaptive exploration method, enabling wide
applicability and ease of adoption. By restricting intensive exploratory
computations to infrequent intervals, our approach can also enhance
computational efficiency. Empirical evaluations confirm our theoretical
findings, showing state-of-the-art regret performance and runtime improvements
over existing methods.

Motivation: 生存分析需要同时建模患者异质性和时间动态，现有方法难以灵活整合这两个方面。

Method: 使用双混合专家框架：特征编码MoE用于亚组感知表示学习，风险MoE利用患者特征和时间嵌入捕捉时间动态。

Result: 在METABRIC和GBSG乳腺癌数据集上，时间依赖C指数提升高达0.04，与Consurv框架结合时获得进一步增益。

Conclusion: 双MoE框架能有效提升生存分析性能，灵活整合现有深度学习生存分析流程。

Abstract: Survival analysis is a task to model the time until an event of interest
occurs, widely used in clinical and biomedical research. A key challenge is to
model patient heterogeneity while also adapting risk predictions to both
individual characteristics and temporal dynamics. We propose a dual
mixture-of-experts (MoE) framework for discrete-time survival analysis. Our
approach combines a feature-encoder MoE for subgroup-aware representation
learning with a hazard MoE that leverages patient features and time embeddings
to capture temporal dynamics. This dual-MoE design flexibly integrates with
existing deep learning based survival pipelines. On METABRIC and GBSG breast
cancer datasets, our method consistently improves performance, boosting the
time-dependent C-index up to 0.04 on the test sets, and yields further gains
when incorporated into the Consurv framework.

Motivation: 探究AI系统是真正理解人类概念还是仅模仿表面模式，通过象棋这一精确战略领域来验证。

Method: 分析270M参数的transformer模型，引入首个Chess960数据集（240个专家标注位置，涵盖6个战略概念），通过随机起始位置消除开局理论影响。

Result: 早期层对人类概念（如中心控制、马前哨）识别准确率达85%，但深层降至50-65%；在Chess960中概念识别下降10-20%，显示模型依赖记忆模式而非抽象理解。

Conclusion: 当前架构存在根本矛盾：赢得游戏的表征与人类思维表征相背离，AI系统优化性能时发展出异类智能，这对需要真正人机协作的创造性AI应用构成挑战。

Abstract: Do AI systems truly understand human concepts or merely mimic surface
patterns? We investigate this through chess, where human creativity meets
precise strategic concepts. Analyzing a 270M-parameter transformer that
achieves grandmaster-level play, we uncover a striking paradox: while early
layers encode human concepts like center control and knight outposts with up to
85\% accuracy, deeper layers, despite driving superior performance, drift
toward alien representations, dropping to 50-65\% accuracy. To test conceptual
robustness beyond memorization, we introduce the first Chess960 dataset: 240
expert-annotated positions across 6 strategic concepts. When opening theory is
eliminated through randomized starting positions, concept recognition drops
10-20\% across all methods, revealing the model's reliance on memorized
patterns rather than abstract understanding. Our layer-wise analysis exposes a
fundamental tension in current architectures: the representations that win
games diverge from those that align with human thinking. These findings suggest
that as AI systems optimize for performance, they develop increasingly alien
intelligence, a critical challenge for creative AI applications requiring
genuine human-AI collaboration. Dataset and code are available at:

Conclusion: 这是首个大规模研究知识蒸馏对去偏影响的工作，为设计更好的去偏方法提供了指导。

Abstract: Knowledge distillation (KD) is an effective method for model compression and
transferring knowledge between models. However, its effect on model's
robustness against spurious correlations that degrade performance on
out-of-distribution data remains underexplored. This study investigates the
effect of knowledge distillation on the transferability of ``debiasing''
capabilities from teacher models to student models on natural language
inference (NLI) and image classification tasks. Through extensive experiments,
we illustrate several key findings: (i) overall the debiasing capability of a
model is undermined post-KD; (ii) training a debiased model does not benefit
from injecting teacher knowledge; (iii) although the overall robustness of a
model may remain stable post-distillation, significant variations can occur
across different types of biases; and (iv) we pin-point the internal attention
pattern and circuit that causes the distinct behavior post-KD. Given the above
findings, we propose three effective solutions to improve the distillability of
debiasing methods: developing high quality data for augmentation, implementing
iterative knowledge distillation, and initializing student models with weights
obtained from teacher models. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
study on the effect of KD on debiasing and its interenal mechanism at scale.
Our findings provide understandings on how KD works and how to design better
debiasing methods.

Motivation: 符号回归旨在从观测数据中发现数学表达式，但深度学习方法的缩放规律尚未被充分探索。受语言模型缩放定律启发，本研究填补了这一空白。

Method: 使用可扩展的端到端transformer流水线和精心生成的训练数据，在五个不同模型规模和三个数量级的计算量范围内进行系统实验。

Conclusion: 符号回归性能很大程度上可从计算量预测，这为训练下一代SR模型提供了重要见解。

Abstract: Symbolic regression (SR) aims to discover the underlying mathematical
expressions that explain observed data. This holds promise for both gaining
scientific insight and for producing inherently interpretable and generalizable
models for tabular data. In this work we focus on the basics of SR. Deep
learning-based SR has recently become competitive with genetic programming
approaches, but the role of scale has remained largely unexplored. Inspired by
scaling laws in language modeling, we present the first systematic
investigation of scaling in SR, using a scalable end-to-end transformer
pipeline and carefully generated training data. Across five different model
sizes and spanning three orders of magnitude in compute, we find that both
validation loss and solved rate follow clear power-law trends with compute. We
further identify compute-optimal hyperparameter scaling: optimal batch size and
learning rate grow with model size, and a token-to-parameter ratio of
$\approx$15 is optimal in our regime, with a slight upward trend as compute
increases. These results demonstrate that SR performance is largely predictable
from compute and offer important insights for training the next generation of
SR models.

Conclusion: 为构建能够自主演化几何和拓扑的完全动态"元学习器"奠定了坚实基础，在科学模型发现和鲁棒表示学习等领域具有广阔应用前景。

Abstract: This paper proposes a novel paradigm for machine learning that moves beyond
traditional parameter optimization. Unlike conventional approaches that search
for optimal parameters within a fixed geometric space, our core idea is to
treat the model itself as a malleable geometric entity. Specifically, we
optimize the metric tensor field on a manifold with a predefined topology,
thereby dynamically shaping the geometric structure of the model space. To
achieve this, we construct a variational framework whose loss function
carefully balances data fidelity against the intrinsic geometric complexity of
the manifold. The former ensures the model effectively explains observed data,
while the latter acts as a regularizer, penalizing overly curved or irregular
geometries to encourage simpler models and prevent overfitting. To address the
computational challenges of this infinite-dimensional optimization problem, we
introduce a practical method based on discrete differential geometry: the
continuous manifold is discretized into a triangular mesh, and the metric
tensor is parameterized by edge lengths, enabling efficient optimization using
automatic differentiation tools. Theoretical analysis reveals a profound
analogy between our framework and the Einstein-Hilbert action in general
relativity, providing an elegant physical interpretation for the concept of
"data-driven geometry". We further argue that even with fixed topology, metric
optimization offers significantly greater expressive power than models with
fixed geometry. This work lays a solid foundation for constructing fully
dynamic "meta-learners" capable of autonomously evolving their geometry and
topology, and it points to broad application prospects in areas such as
scientific model discovery and robust representation learning.

Abstract: Synthetic data generation has emerged as a promising approach to address the
challenges of using sensitive financial data in machine learning applications.
By leveraging generative models, such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)
and Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), it is possible to create artificial
datasets that preserve the statistical properties of real financial records
while mitigating privacy risks and regulatory constraints. Despite the rapid
growth of this field, a comprehensive synthesis of the current research
landscape has been lacking. This systematic review consolidates and analyses 72
studies published since 2018 that focus on synthetic financial data generation.
We categorise the types of financial information synthesised, the generative
methods employed, and the evaluation strategies used to assess data utility and
privacy. The findings indicate that GAN-based approaches dominate the
literature, particularly for generating time-series market data and tabular
credit data. While several innovative techniques demonstrate potential for
improved realism and privacy preservation, there remains a notable lack of
rigorous evaluation of privacy safeguards across studies. By providing an
integrated overview of generative techniques, applications, and evaluation
methods, this review highlights critical research gaps and offers guidance for
future work aimed at developing robust, privacy-preserving synthetic data
solutions for the financial domain.

TL;DR: 提出Nirvana模型，这是一种具有专用记忆机制、线性时间复杂度和测试时任务信息提取能力的专业化通用模型。通过任务感知记忆触发器和专用记忆更新器，模型能够根据任务需求灵活调整记忆机制，并在领域转换时动态适应。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统LLM结构（包括Transformer、线性注意力和混合模型）缺乏由任务信息引导的专用记忆机制。为了在保持广泛能力的同时在目标领域达到专家级性能，需要开发具有任务感知记忆机制的专业化通用模型。

Method: 提出Nirvana模型，包含任务感知记忆触发器（Trigger）和专用记忆更新器（Updater）。Trigger根据当前任务需求灵活调整记忆机制，将每个输入样本视为自监督微调任务；Updater在Trigger引导下动态记忆上下文。

Result: 在多种自然语言建模基准测试中，Nirvana取得了与现有LLM结构相当或更优的结果。在具有挑战性的医学任务（MRI）上，尽管Nirvana主干网络被冻结，但Trigger引导模型适应MRI领域，实现了比传统MRI模型和传统LLM主干模型更高质量的MRI重建，并能生成准确的初步临床报告。

Conclusion: Nirvana通过专用记忆机制成功实现了专业化通用模型的目标，在保持广泛能力的同时在特定领域达到专家级性能，证明了任务感知记忆机制在领域适应中的有效性。

Abstract: Specialized Generalist Models (SGMs) aim to preserve broad capabilities while
achieving expert-level performance in target domains. However, traditional LLM
structures including Transformer, Linear Attention, and hybrid models do not
employ specialized memory mechanism guided by task information. In this paper,
we present Nirvana, an SGM with specialized memory mechanism, linear time
complexity, and test-time task information extraction. Besides, we propose the
Task-Aware Memory Trigger ($\textit{Trigger}$) that flexibly adjusts memory
mechanism based on the current task's requirements. In Trigger, each incoming
sample is treated as a self-supervised fine-tuning task, enabling Nirvana to
adapt its task-related parameters on the fly to domain shifts. We also design
the Specialized Memory Updater ($\textit{Updater}$) that dynamically memorizes
the context guided by Trigger. We conduct experiments on both general language
tasks and specialized medical tasks. On a variety of natural language modeling
benchmarks, Nirvana achieves competitive or superior results compared to the
existing LLM structures. To prove the effectiveness of Trigger on specialized
tasks, we test Nirvana's performance on a challenging medical task, i.e.,
Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). We post-train frozen Nirvana backbone with
lightweight codecs on paired electromagnetic signals and MRI images. Despite
the frozen Nirvana backbone, Trigger guides the model to adapt to the MRI
domain with the change of task-related parameters. Nirvana achieves
higher-quality MRI reconstruction compared to conventional MRI models as well
as the models with traditional LLMs' backbone, and can also generate accurate
preliminary clinical reports accordingly.

*Zheng Zhang,Haonan Li,Xingyu Li,Hang Zhang,Zhiyun Qian*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于大语言模型的多阶段bug二分查找方法，相比传统方法准确率提升38%，比基线LLM方法提升60%


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于补丁的二分查找方法存在多个限制：假设bug引入提交和补丁提交修改相同函数、仅依赖代码变更而忽略提交消息中的漏洞信息、基于简单启发式方法缺乏逻辑分析

Method: 构建全面的多阶段流水线，利用LLM：(1)充分利用补丁信息，(2)在上下文中比较多个候选提交，(3)通过一系列筛选步骤逐步缩小候选范围

Result: 评估显示该方法比最先进解决方案准确率提升超过38%，多阶段流水线相比基线LLM二分查找方法准确率提升60%

Conclusion: LLM能够突破现有解决方案的障碍，理解补丁和提交中的文本数据和代码，多阶段流水线对于准确识别bug引入提交至关重要

Abstract: Bug bisection has been an important security task that aims to understand the
range of software versions impacted by a bug, i.e., identifying the commit that
introduced the bug. However, traditional patch-based bisection methods are
faced with several significant barriers: For example, they assume that the
bug-inducing commit (BIC) and the patch commit modify the same functions, which
is not always true. They often rely solely on code changes, while the commit
message frequently contains a wealth of vulnerability-related information. They
are also based on simple heuristics (e.g., assuming the BIC initializes lines
deleted in the patch) and lack any logical analysis of the vulnerability.
  In this paper, we make the observation that Large Language Models (LLMs) are
well-positioned to break the barriers of existing solutions, e.g., comprehend
both textual data and code in patches and commits. Unlike previous BIC
identification approaches, which yield poor results, we propose a comprehensive
multi-stage pipeline that leverages LLMs to: (1) fully utilize patch
information, (2) compare multiple candidate commits in context, and (3)
progressively narrow down the candidates through a series of down-selection
steps. In our evaluation, we demonstrate that our approach achieves
significantly better accuracy than the state-of-the-art solution by more than
38\%. Our results further confirm that the comprehensive multi-stage pipeline
is essential, as it improves accuracy by 60\% over a baseline LLM-based
bisection method.

### [43] [Network-Constrained Policy Optimization for Adaptive Multi-agent Vehicle Routing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26089)
*Fazel Arasteh,Arian Haghparast,Manos Papagelis*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了两种基于多智能体强化学习的动态车辆路由方法：自适应导航(AN)和分层枢纽自适应导航(HHAN)，用于解决城市交通拥堵问题，在合成网格和真实城市地图上显著减少了平均旅行时间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统最短路径优先(SPF)算法在动态多车辆环境中表现不佳，往往导致所有车辆选择相同路径而加剧拥堵，需要开发能够协调多车辆的网络感知路由方法。

Method: AN采用分散式MARL，每个交叉口智能体基于本地交通和图注意力网络(GAT)建模的邻域状态提供路由指导；HHAN是AN的扩展，仅在关键枢纽分配智能体，车辆在枢纽间由智能体控制路由，枢纽区域内使用SPF处理微路由，采用集中训练分散执行(CTDE)和注意力Q混合(A-QMIX)框架。

Result: AN相比SPF和学习基线减少了平均旅行时间，保持100%路由成功率；HHAN可扩展到数百个交叉口的网络，在重交通下实现高达15.9%的改进。

Conclusion: 网络约束的MARL在智能交通系统中具有实现可扩展、协调和拥堵感知路由的潜力。

Abstract: Traffic congestion in urban road networks leads to longer trip times and
higher emissions, especially during peak periods. While the Shortest Path First
(SPF) algorithm is optimal for a single vehicle in a static network, it
performs poorly in dynamic, multi-vehicle settings, often worsening congestion
by routing all vehicles along identical paths. We address dynamic vehicle
routing through a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) framework for
coordinated, network-aware fleet navigation. We first propose Adaptive
Navigation (AN), a decentralized MARL model where each intersection agent
provides routing guidance based on (i) local traffic and (ii) neighborhood
state modeled using Graph Attention Networks (GAT). To improve scalability in
large networks, we further propose Hierarchical Hub-based Adaptive Navigation
(HHAN), an extension of AN that assigns agents only to key intersections
(hubs). Vehicles are routed hub-to-hub under agent control, while SPF handles
micro-routing within each hub region. For hub coordination, HHAN adopts
centralized training with decentralized execution (CTDE) under the Attentive
Q-Mixing (A-QMIX) framework, which aggregates asynchronous vehicle decisions
via attention. Hub agents use flow-aware state features that combine local
congestion and predictive dynamics for proactive routing. Experiments on
synthetic grids and real urban maps (Toronto, Manhattan) show that AN reduces
average travel time versus SPF and learning baselines, maintaining 100% routing
success. HHAN scales to networks with hundreds of intersections, achieving up
to 15.9% improvement under heavy traffic. These findings highlight the
potential of network-constrained MARL for scalable, coordinated, and
congestion-aware routing in intelligent transportation systems.

### [44] [SAFE: A Novel Approach to AI Weather Evaluation through Stratified Assessments of Forecasts over Earth](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26099)
*Nick Masi,Randall Balestriero*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SAFE是一个用于评估地球预测模型分层性能的开源工具包，通过按国家、地区、收入水平和土地覆盖等属性对预测结果进行分层分析，揭示模型在不同地理和社会经济条件下的性能差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统机器学习评估方法基于测试集上的平均损失，这在地球科学中相当于将性能在全球范围内平均化，忽略了人类发展和地理分布的不均匀性。

Method: 开发SAFE工具包，整合多种数据域，按地理网格点的不同属性（领土、全球子区域、收入、土地覆盖）进行分层，分析每个属性层级的模型性能。

Result: 使用SAFE对最先进的AI天气预测模型进行基准测试，发现所有模型在所有属性上都存在预测技能差异，建立了不同领先时间和气候变量的模型预测公平性基准。

Conclusion: 通过超越全局平均指标，首次能够回答模型在何处表现最佳或最差，以及哪些模型最公平的问题，为相关研究提供了开源工具支持。

Abstract: The dominant paradigm in machine learning is to assess model performance
based on average loss across all samples in some test set. This amounts to
averaging performance geospatially across the Earth in weather and climate
settings, failing to account for the non-uniform distribution of human
development and geography. We introduce Stratified Assessments of Forecasts
over Earth (SAFE), a package for elucidating the stratified performance of a
set of predictions made over Earth. SAFE integrates various data domains to
stratify by different attributes associated with geospatial gridpoints:
territory (usually country), global subregion, income, and landcover (land or
water). This allows us to examine the performance of models for each individual
stratum of the different attributes (e.g., the accuracy in every individual
country). To demonstrate its importance, we utilize SAFE to benchmark a zoo of
state-of-the-art AI-based weather prediction models, finding that they all
exhibit disparities in forecasting skill across every attribute. We use this to
seed a benchmark of model forecast fairness through stratification at different
lead times for various climatic variables. By moving beyond globally-averaged
metrics, we for the first time ask: where do models perform best or worst, and
which models are most fair? To support further work in this direction, the SAFE
package is open source and available at https://github.com/N-Masi/safe

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出LTE方法，通过让LLM学习自己之前生成的错误答案和过长回答，无需外部专家指导，解决RLVR中的探索停滞问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RLVR方法仅基于LLM自身生成的回答进行训练，受限于LLM初始能力，容易出现探索停滞，无法解决更多训练问题。现有方法需要外部专家指导但可用性有限

Method: LTE方法：让LLM学习从试错中推理，提示LLM其之前自生成的错误答案和过长回答问题，无需外部专家指导

Result: 在六个数学基准测试中，LTE比正常GRPO在Pass@1上平均提升6.38，在Pass@k上平均提升9.00。分析证实LTE成功缓解探索停滞问题，增强训练中的利用和探索

Conclusion: LTE方法有效解决了RLVR中的探索停滞问题，无需外部专家指导，显著提升了LLM的推理能力

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has significantly
boosted the reasoning capability of large language models (LLMs) recently.
However, existing RLVR approaches merely train LLMs based on their own
generated responses and are constrained by the initial capability of LLMs, thus
prone to exploration stagnation, in which LLMs fail to solve more training
problems and cannot further learn from the training data. Some work tries to
address this by leveraging off-policy solutions to training problems but
requires external guidance from experts which suffers from limited
availability. In this work, we propose LTE (Learning to reason from Trial and
Error), an approach hinting LLMs with their previously self-generated incorrect
answers and problem of overlong responses, which does not require any external
expert guidance. Experiments validate the effectiveness of LTE, which
outperforms the normal group relative policy optimization (GRPO) by 6.38 in
Pass@1 and 9.00 in Pass@k on average across six mathematics benchmarks for
Qwen3-4B-Base. Further analysis confirms that LTE successfully mitigates the
problem of exploration stagnation and enhances both exploitation and
exploration during training.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: maxVSTAR是一个视觉引导的模型自适应框架，通过跨模态师生架构，利用YOLO视觉模型为CSI数据流提供实时活动标签，实现边缘设备上CSI传感系统的自主领域适应。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决WiFi CSI活动识别在边缘设备部署中面临的领域偏移问题，即环境变化导致识别性能下降，同时保持隐私保护特性。

Method: 采用闭环视觉引导模型适应框架，包含跨模态师生架构：YOLO视觉模型作为动态监督信号提供活动标签，用于在线微调轻量级CSI活动识别模型STAR。

Result: 在未校准硬件上，基线STAR模型准确率从93.52%降至49.14%，经过一次视觉引导适应后，maxVSTAR将准确率恢复至81.51%。

Conclusion: maxVSTAR证明了在隐私敏感的物联网环境中实现动态、自监督模型适应的能力，为边缘CSI传感建立了可扩展的长期自主活动识别范式。

Abstract: WiFi Channel State Information (CSI)-based human activity recognition (HAR)
provides a privacy-preserving, device-free sensing solution for smart
environments. However, its deployment on edge devices is severely constrained
by domain shift, where recognition performance deteriorates under varying
environmental and hardware conditions. This study presents maxVSTAR (maximally
adaptive Vision-guided Sensing Technology for Activity Recognition), a
closed-loop, vision-guided model adaptation framework that autonomously
mitigates domain shift for edge-deployed CSI sensing systems. The proposed
system integrates a cross-modal teacher-student architecture, where a
high-accuracy YOLO-based vision model serves as a dynamic supervisory signal,
delivering real-time activity labels for the CSI data stream. These labels
enable autonomous, online fine-tuning of a lightweight CSI-based HAR model,
termed Sensing Technology for Activity Recognition (STAR), directly at the
edge. This closed-loop retraining mechanism allows STAR to continuously adapt
to environmental changes without manual intervention. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the effectiveness of maxVSTAR. When deployed on uncalibrated
hardware, the baseline STAR model's recognition accuracy declined from 93.52%
to 49.14%. Following a single vision-guided adaptation cycle, maxVSTAR restored
the accuracy to 81.51%. These results confirm the system's capacity for
dynamic, self-supervised model adaptation in privacy-conscious IoT
environments, establishing a scalable and practical paradigm for long-term
autonomous HAR using CSI sensing at the network edge.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的Wi-Fi CSI活动识别方法在资源受限的嵌入式移动边缘环境中存在计算效率低、延迟高和可行性有限的问题。

Method: 采用轻量级GRU网络（比传统LSTM参数减少33%）、多级预处理流水线（中值滤波、巴特沃斯低通滤波、经验模态分解）进行信号去噪和时空特征提取，并在Rockchip RV1126处理器上部署。

Result: 在7种活动类别上平均识别准确率达93.52%，人体存在检测准确率99.11%；INT8量化推理处理速度33MHz，CPU利用率仅8%，比CPU执行快6倍；响应延迟低于1秒，功耗低。

Conclusion: STAR系统实现了实时、隐私保护的HAR，为移动和普适计算环境提供了实用、可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Human Activity Recognition (HAR) via Wi-Fi Channel State Information (CSI)
presents a privacy-preserving, contactless sensing approach suitable for smart
homes, healthcare monitoring, and mobile IoT systems. However, existing methods
often encounter computational inefficiency, high latency, and limited
feasibility within resource-constrained, embedded mobile edge environments.
This paper proposes STAR (Sensing Technology for Activity Recognition), an
edge-AI-optimized framework that integrates a lightweight neural architecture,
adaptive signal processing, and hardware-aware co-optimization to enable
real-time, energy-efficient HAR on low-power embedded devices. STAR
incorporates a streamlined Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU)-based recurrent neural
network, reducing model parameters by 33% compared to conventional LSTM models
while maintaining effective temporal modeling capability. A multi-stage
pre-processing pipeline combining median filtering, 8th-order Butterworth
low-pass filtering, and Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) is employed to
denoise CSI amplitude data and extract spatial-temporal features. For on-device
deployment, STAR is implemented on a Rockchip RV1126 processor equipped with an
embedded Neural Processing Unit (NPU), interfaced with an ESP32-S3-based CSI
acquisition module. Experimental results demonstrate a mean recognition
accuracy of 93.52% across seven activity classes and 99.11% for human presence
detection, utilizing a compact 97.6k-parameter model. INT8 quantized inference
achieves a processing speed of 33 MHz with just 8% CPU utilization, delivering
sixfold speed improvements over CPU-based execution. With sub-second response
latency and low power consumption, the system ensures real-time,
privacy-preserving HAR, offering a practical, scalable solution for mobile and
pervasive computing environments.

TL;DR: MolBridge是一个基于子结构感知对齐的分子-文本学习框架，通过分子子结构和化学短语的额外对齐信号增强原始分子-描述对，采用子结构感知对比学习和自精炼机制来学习细粒度对应关系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有模型难以捕捉分子与其描述之间的细微差异，缺乏学习分子子结构与化学短语之间细粒度对齐的能力。

Method: 通过分子子结构和化学短语的额外对齐信号增强数据，采用子结构感知对比学习和自精炼机制过滤噪声对齐信号。

Result: MolBridge在多个分子基准测试中有效捕捉细粒度对应关系，优于现有最先进基线方法。

Conclusion: 子结构感知对齐在分子-文本学习中具有重要意义，MolBridge框架展示了其有效性。

Abstract: Molecule and text representation learning has gained increasing interest due
to its potential for enhancing the understanding of chemical information.
However, existing models often struggle to capture subtle differences between
molecules and their descriptions, as they lack the ability to learn
fine-grained alignments between molecular substructures and chemical phrases.
To address this limitation, we introduce MolBridge, a novel molecule-text
learning framework based on substructure-aware alignments. Specifically, we
augment the original molecule-description pairs with additional alignment
signals derived from molecular substructures and chemical phrases. To
effectively learn from these enriched alignments, MolBridge employs
substructure-aware contrastive learning, coupled with a self-refinement
mechanism that filters out noisy alignment signals. Experimental results show
that MolBridge effectively captures fine-grained correspondences and
outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on a wide range of molecular benchmarks,
highlighting the significance of substructure-aware alignment in molecule-text
learning.

Method: 评估了变化点衍生的统计特征、基于聚类的子结构表示和混合学习策略，并与简单的随机森林+XGBoost集成模型在分段数据上的表现进行对比。

Result: 复杂方法表现不佳，而简单集成模型实现了AUC-ROC 0.976、F1分数0.41，并在定义时间窗口内达到100%的早期检测率。

Conclusion: 在高度不平衡和时间不确定的数据场景下，模型简洁性结合优化分段能超越更复杂的架构，提供更好的鲁棒性、可解释性和操作实用性。

Abstract: In this study, we investigate the effectiveness of advanced feature
engineering and hybrid model architectures for anomaly detection in a
multivariate industrial time series, focusing on a steam turbine system. We
evaluate the impact of change point-derived statistical features,
clustering-based substructure representations, and hybrid learning strategies
on detection performance. Despite their theoretical appeal, these complex
approaches consistently underperformed compared to a simple Random Forest +
XGBoost ensemble trained on segmented data. The ensemble achieved an AUC-ROC of
0.976, F1-score of 0.41, and 100% early detection within the defined time
window. Our findings highlight that, in scenarios with highly imbalanced and
temporally uncertain data, model simplicity combined with optimized
segmentation can outperform more sophisticated architectures, offering greater

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有公共资源分配方法独立优化单个资源移动，忽略了容量约束，需要更实用的方法来处理现实场景中的协作资源分配问题。

Method: 将CPRA问题建模为势博弈，提出GSTRL框架，结合博弈论和强化学习来捕捉系统时空动态并近似纳什均衡。

Result: 在两个真实世界数据集上的实验表明，GSTRL框架表现出优越性能。

Conclusion: GSTRL为协作公共资源分配问题提供了理论基础和有效解决方案，能够处理容量约束和时空动态。

Abstract: Public resource allocation involves the efficient distribution of resources,
including urban infrastructure, energy, and transportation, to effectively meet
societal demands. However, existing methods focus on optimizing the movement of
individual resources independently, without considering their capacity
constraints. To address this limitation, we propose a novel and more practical
problem: Collaborative Public Resource Allocation (CPRA), which explicitly
incorporates capacity constraints and spatio-temporal dynamics in real-world
scenarios. We propose a new framework called Game-Theoretic Spatio-Temporal
Reinforcement Learning (GSTRL) for solving CPRA. Our contributions are twofold:
1) We formulate the CPRA problem as a potential game and demonstrate that there
is no gap between the potential function and the optimal target, laying a solid
theoretical foundation for approximating the Nash equilibrium of this NP-hard
problem; and 2) Our designed GSTRL framework effectively captures the
spatio-temporal dynamics of the overall system. We evaluate GSTRL on two
real-world datasets, where experiments show its superior performance. Our
source codes are available in the supplementary materials.

TL;DR: 提出了ACC-SGD-IE方法，通过跨训练传播留一扰动并更新累积影响状态，改进了标准SGD-IE在数据影响估计中的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代以数据为中心的AI需要精确的样本级影响估计，但标准SGD-IE忽略了跨epoch的复合效应，导致关键样本排序错误。

Method: ACC-SGD-IE是一种轨迹感知估计器，在训练过程中传播留一扰动，并在每个步骤更新累积影响状态。

Result: 在平滑强凸设置中实现几何误差收缩，在平滑非凸机制中收紧误差边界；更大mini-batch进一步减少常数。在多个数据集上产生更准确的影响估计，特别是在长epoch中。

Conclusion: ACC-SGD-IE在下游数据清洗中更可靠地标记噪声样本，使用其清洗数据训练的模型优于SGD-IE清洗的模型。

Abstract: Modern data-centric AI needs precise per-sample influence. Standard SGD-IE
approximates leave-one-out effects by summing per-epoch surrogates and ignores
cross-epoch compounding, which misranks critical examples. We propose
ACC-SGD-IE, a trajectory-aware estimator that propagates the leave-one-out
perturbation across training and updates an accumulative influence state at
each step. In smooth strongly convex settings it achieves geometric error
contraction and, in smooth non-convex regimes, it tightens error bounds; larger
mini-batches further reduce constants. Empirically, on Adult, 20 Newsgroups,
and MNIST under clean and corrupted data and both convex and non-convex
training, ACC-SGD-IE yields more accurate influence estimates, especially over
long epochs. For downstream data cleansing it more reliably flags noisy
samples, producing models trained on ACC-SGD-IE cleaned data that outperform
those cleaned with SGD-IE.

Abstract: Reducing preventable hospital readmissions is a national priority for payers,
providers, and policymakers seeking to improve health care and lower costs. The
rate of readmission is being used as a benchmark to determine the quality of
healthcare provided by the hospitals. In thisproject, we have used machine
learning techniques like Logistic Regression, Random Forest and Support Vector
Machines to analyze the health claims data and identify demographic and medical
factors that play a crucial role in predicting all-cause readmissions. As the
health claims data is high dimensional, we have used Principal Component
Analysis as a dimension reduction technique and used the results for building
regression models. We compared and evaluated these models based on the Area
Under Curve (AUC) metric. Random Forest model gave the highest performance
followed by Logistic Regression and Support Vector Machine models. These models
can be used to identify the crucial factors causing readmissions and help
identify patients to focus on to reduce the chances of readmission, ultimately
bringing down the cost and increasing the quality of healthcare provided to the
patients.

Result: AISP在样本使用数量方面优于最佳n采样，并比其他基于奖励的测试时对齐方法获得更高奖励。

Conclusion: AISP是一种有效的测试时对齐方法，能够在不需要微调的情况下提升模型性能。

Abstract: Test-time alignment of large language models (LLMs) attracts attention
because fine-tuning LLMs requires high computational costs. In this paper, we
propose a new test-time alignment method called adaptive importance sampling on
pre-logits (AISP) on the basis of the sampling-based model predictive control
with the stochastic control input. AISP applies the Gaussian perturbation into
pre-logits, which are outputs of the penultimate layer, so as to maximize
expected rewards with respect to the mean of the perturbation. We demonstrate
that the optimal mean is obtained by importance sampling with sampled rewards.
AISP outperforms best-of-n sampling in terms of rewards over the number of used
samples and achieves higher rewards than other reward-based test-time alignment
methods.

solutions typically face scalability issues and have to address practical
requirements such as full access to original datasets and model. In contrast to
the existing approaches, we regard classification training as a sequential
process where classes are learned sequentially, which we call \emph{inductive
approach}. Unlearning can then be done by reversing the last training sequence.
This is implemented by appending a projection-redistribution layer in the end
of the model. Such an approach does not require full access to the original
dataset or the model, addressing the challenges of existing methods. This
enables modular and model-agnostic deployment as an output filter into existing
classification pipelines with minimal alterations. We conducted multiple
experiments across multiple datasets including image (CIFAR-10/100 using
CNN-based model) and tabular datasets (Covertype using tree-based model).
Experiment results show consistently similar output to a fully retrained model
with a high computational cost reduction. This demonstrates the applicability,
scalability, and system compatibility of our solution while maintaining the
performance of the output in a more practical setting.

*Hieu M. Vu,Tan M. Nguyen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Angular Steering的新方法，通过旋转激活向量在二维子空间内实现行为调控，相比现有方法具有更好的连续性和稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大语言模型行为控制方法（如向量加法和方向消融）局限于二维子空间，对参数选择敏感且可能影响不相关特征，需要更灵活稳定的调控方法。

Method: 将行为调控建模为几何旋转，在固定的二维子空间内旋转激活向量朝向或远离目标行为方向，并提出了自适应版本仅旋转与目标特征对齐的激活。

Result: 实验表明Angular Steering在拒绝和情感调控等用例中实现了稳健的行为控制，同时保持了通用语言建模性能，相比现有方法更具灵活性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: Angular Steering将现有技术统一在几何旋转框架下，简化了参数选择，在多种模型家族和规模上都表现出优越的性能，为安全可靠AI部署提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Controlling specific behaviors in large language models while preserving
their general capabilities is a central challenge for safe and reliable
artificial intelligence deployment. Current steering methods, such as vector
addition and directional ablation, are constrained within a two-dimensional
subspace defined by the activation and feature direction, making them sensitive
to chosen parameters and potentially affecting unrelated features due to
unintended interactions in activation space. We introduce Angular Steering, a
novel and flexible method for behavior modulation that operates by rotating
activations within a fixed two-dimensional subspace. By formulating steering as
a geometric rotation toward or away from a target behavior direction, Angular
Steering provides continuous, fine-grained control over behaviors such as
refusal and compliance. We demonstrate this method using refusal steering
emotion steering as use cases. Additionally, we propose Adaptive Angular
Steering, a selective variant that rotates only activations aligned with the
target feature, further enhancing stability and coherence. Angular Steering
generalizes existing addition and orthogonalization techniques under a unified
geometric rotation framework, simplifying parameter selection and maintaining
model stability across a broader range of adjustments. Experiments across
multiple model families and sizes show that Angular Steering achieves robust
behavioral control while maintaining general language modeling performance,
underscoring its flexibility, generalization, and robustness compared to prior
approaches. Code and artifacts are available at

Method: 开发了一种新颖算法，将插值视为在合适数据分布约束下的测地线，并在局部可视为黎曼度量下的测地线。

Result: 定量实验表明，该方法在多种模型和数据集上比基线方法更频繁地穿越高密度区域。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种无需额外训练的通用插值方案，能够生成与数据分布兼容的过渡路径，并在理论上具有黎曼几何基础。

Abstract: Interpolation in generative models allows for controlled generation, model
inspection, and more. Unfortunately, most generative models lack a principal
notion of interpolants without restrictive assumptions on either the model or
data dimension. In this paper, we develop a general interpolation scheme that
targets likely transition paths compatible with different metrics and
probability distributions. We consider interpolants analogous to a geodesic
constrained to a suitable data distribution and derive a novel algorithm for
computing these curves, which requires no additional training. Theoretically,
we show that our method locally can be considered as a geodesic under a
suitable Riemannian metric. We quantitatively show that our interpolation
scheme traverses higher density regions than baselines across a range of models
and datasets.

Abstract: Diffusion models have been successful in learning complex data distributions.
This capability has driven their application to high-dimensional
multi-objective black-box optimization problem. Existing approaches often
employ an external optimization loop, such as an evolutionary algorithm, to the
diffusion model. However, these approaches treat the diffusion model as a
black-box refiner, which overlooks the internal distribution transition of the
diffusion generation process, limiting their efficiency. To address these
challenges, we propose the Inference-time Multi-target Generation (IMG)
algorithm, which optimizes the diffusion process at inference-time to generate
samples that simultaneously satisfy multiple objectives. Specifically, our IMG
performs weighted resampling during the diffusion generation process according
to the expected aggregated multi-objective values. This weighted resampling
strategy ensures the diffusion-generated samples are distributed according to
our desired multi-target Boltzmann distribution. We further derive that the
multi-target Boltzmann distribution has an interesting log-likelihood
interpretation, where it is the optimal solution to the distributional
multi-objective optimization problem. We implemented IMG for a multi-objective
molecule generation task. Experiments show that IMG, requiring only a single
generation pass, achieves a significantly higher hypervolume than baseline
optimization algorithms that often require hundreds of diffusion generations.
Notably, our algorithm can be viewed as an optimized diffusion process and can
be integrated into existing methods to further improve their performance.

Abstract: Multi-task learning in contextual bandits has attracted significant research
interest due to its potential to enhance decision-making across multiple
related tasks by leveraging shared structures and task-specific heterogeneity.
In this article, we propose a novel hierarchical Bayesian framework for
learning in various bandit instances. This framework captures both the
heterogeneity and the correlations among different bandit instances through a
hierarchical Bayesian model, enabling effective information sharing while
accommodating instance-specific variations. Unlike previous methods that
overlook the learning of the covariance structure across bandits, we introduce
an empirical Bayesian approach to estimate the covariance matrix of the prior
distribution.This enhances both the practicality and flexibility of learning
across multi-bandits. Building on this approach, we develop two efficient
algorithms: ebmTS (Empirical Bayesian Multi-Bandit Thompson Sampling) and
ebmUCB (Empirical Bayesian Multi-Bandit Upper Confidence Bound), both of which
incorporate the estimated prior into the decision-making process. We provide
the frequentist regret upper bounds for the proposed algorithms, thereby
filling a research gap in the field of multi-bandit problems. Extensive
experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the superior
performance of our algorithms, particularly in complex environments. Our
methods achieve lower cumulative regret compared to existing techniques,
highlighting their effectiveness in balancing exploration and exploitation
across multi-bandits.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文研究了离线聚类偏好学习问题，针对多用户偏好差异和离线数据不平衡的挑战，提出了纯离线学习算法Off-C²PL和带主动数据增强的A²-Off-C²PL算法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界中的偏好学习涉及具有不同偏好的用户，且用户交互有限或成本高昂，需要离线学习。主要挑战包括：识别用户相似性以有效聚合数据，以及处理某些偏好维度在离线数据中代表性不足的问题。

Method: 提出Off-C²PL算法用于纯离线设置，通过理论分析捕捉样本噪声与偏差的权衡；扩展为A²-Off-C²PL算法，在聚类结构基础上主动选择针对测试用户最不具信息性维度的样本进行数据增强。

Conclusion: 所提出的离线聚类偏好学习框架能够有效处理多用户偏好差异和数据不平衡问题，主动数据增强策略显著提升了学习效果。

Abstract: Preference learning from pairwise feedback is a widely adopted framework in
applications such as reinforcement learning with human feedback and
recommendations. In many practical settings, however, user interactions are
limited or costly, making offline preference learning necessary. Moreover,
real-world preference learning often involves users with different preferences.
For example, annotators from different backgrounds may rank the same responses
differently. This setting presents two central challenges: (1) identifying
similarity across users to effectively aggregate data, especially under
scenarios where offline data is imbalanced across dimensions, and (2) handling
the imbalanced offline data where some preference dimensions are
underrepresented. To address these challenges, we study the Offline Clustering
of Preference Learning problem, where the learner has access to fixed datasets
from multiple users with potentially different preferences and aims to maximize
utility for a test user. To tackle the first challenge, we first propose
Off-C$^2$PL for the pure offline setting, where the learner relies solely on
offline data. Our theoretical analysis provides a suboptimality bound that
explicitly captures the tradeoff between sample noise and bias. To address the
second challenge of inbalanced data, we extend our framework to the setting
with active-data augmentation where the learner is allowed to select a limited
number of additional active-data for the test user based on the cluster
structure learned by Off-C$^2$PL. In this setting, our second algorithm,
A$^2$-Off-C$^2$PL, actively selects samples that target the least-informative
dimensions of the test user's preference. We prove that these actively
collected samples contribute more effectively than offline ones. Finally, we
validate our theoretical results through simulations on synthetic and
real-world datasets.

*Ziliang Chen,Tianang Xiao,Jusheng Zhang,Yongsen Zheng,Xipeng Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个基于token感知的因果表示学习框架，通过语言token的结构化因果模型来解释CLIP在组合推理上的失败原因，揭示了组合不可识别性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CLIP在跨模态泛化方面表现优异，但在对象、属性和关系的组合推理上持续失败，现有因果解释通常将文本建模为单个向量，无法解释token级结构和硬负例失败等现象。

Method: 提出了基于语言token序列的因果表示学习框架，将块可识别性扩展到token化文本，证明CLIP的对比目标可以在句子级和token级SCM下恢复模态不变潜变量。

Result: 发现存在伪最优文本编码器，虽然实现完美的模态不变对齐，但对原子概念的SWAP、REPLACE和ADD操作不敏感，无法区分正确标题和硬负例。

Conclusion: 语言侧的非可识别性通过模态差距与视觉侧失败相关联，迭代组合操作增加了难度，需要改进负例挖掘策略。

Abstract: Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) delivers strong cross modal
generalization by aligning images and texts in a shared embedding space, yet it
persistently fails at compositional reasoning over objects, attributes, and
relations often behaving like a bag-of-words matcher. Prior causal accounts
typically model text as a single vector, obscuring token-level structure and
leaving core phenomena-such as prompt sensitivity and failures on hard
negatives unexplained. We address this gap with a token-aware causal
representation learning (CRL) framework grounded in a sequential,
language-token SCM. Our theory extends block identifiability to tokenized text,
proving that CLIP's contrastive objective can recover the modal-invariant
latent variable under both sentence-level and token-level SCMs. Crucially,
token granularity yields the first principled explanation of CLIP's
compositional brittleness: composition nonidentifiability. We show the
existence of pseudo-optimal text encoders that achieve perfect modal-invariant
alignment yet are provably insensitive to SWAP, REPLACE, and ADD operations
over atomic concepts, thereby failing to distinguish correct captions from hard
negatives despite optimizing the same training objective as true-optimal
encoders. The analysis further links language-side nonidentifiability to
visual-side failures via the modality gap and shows how iterated composition
operators compound hardness, motivating improved negative mining strategies.

*Beomhan Baek,Minhak Song,Chulhee Yun*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文分析了增量Adam优化器在线性可分数据上的隐式偏差，发现其与全批次Adam不同，可能收敛到ℓ₂最大间隔分类器而非ℓ∞最大间隔分类器，而Signum优化器在任何批次大小下都收敛到ℓ∞最大间隔分类器。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Adam是深度学习中最常用的优化器，但其理论理解仍然有限。先前分析表明Adam偏向ℓ∞几何的解，但这些结果仅限于全批次情况。本文旨在研究增量Adam（每步使用一个样本）在线性可分数据上的隐式偏差。

Method: 构建结构化数据集来证明增量Adam收敛到ℓ₂最大间隔分类器；开发代理算法捕捉β₂→1时增量Adam的极限行为；通过数据依赖的双重定点公式表征其收敛方向；比较Signum优化器的行为。

Result: 增量Adam的隐式偏差与全批次Adam不同，可能收敛到ℓ₂最大间隔分类器；对于一般数据集，增量Adam的极限行为可通过代理算法描述；Signum在任何批次大小下都收敛到ℓ∞最大间隔分类器。

Conclusion: Adam的隐式偏差关键取决于批次方案和数据集，而Signum保持不变。这突显了优化器选择对模型最终解的重要影响。

Abstract: Adam [Kingma and Ba, 2015] is the de facto optimizer in deep learning, yet
its theoretical understanding remains limited. Prior analyses show that Adam
favors solutions aligned with $\ell_\infty$-geometry, but these results are
restricted to the full-batch regime. In this work, we study the implicit bias
of incremental Adam (using one sample per step) for logistic regression on
linearly separable data, and we show that its bias can deviate from the
full-batch behavior. To illustrate this, we construct a class of structured
datasets where incremental Adam provably converges to the $\ell_2$-max-margin
classifier, in contrast to the $\ell_\infty$-max-margin bias of full-batch
Adam. For general datasets, we develop a proxy algorithm that captures the
limiting behavior of incremental Adam as $\beta_2 \to 1$ and we characterize
its convergence direction via a data-dependent dual fixed-point formulation.
Finally, we prove that, unlike Adam, Signum [Bernstein et al., 2018] converges
to the $\ell_\infty$-max-margin classifier for any batch size by taking $\beta$
close enough to 1. Overall, our results highlight that the implicit bias of
Adam crucially depends on both the batching scheme and the dataset, while
Signum remains invariant.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出Per-layer Model Inversion (PMI)和特征建模方法，解决数据无关持续学习中模型反演的两个关键挑战：计算效率低和特征偏移问题，实现在不存储原始数据的情况下进行持续学习。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在隐私和安全约束下，存储和重放数据不可行，数据无关持续学习需要在不访问先前数据的情况下更新模型。现有模型反演方法面临计算效率低和特征偏移问题，特别是在大型预训练模型中。

Method: 提出分层模型反演(PMI)为全模型反演提供强初始化，大幅减少迭代次数；通过高斯分布和对比模型建模类级特征，确保合成特征与真实特征对齐；结合PMI和特征建模，从语义感知投影特征生成伪图像。

Result: 该方法在多个持续学习设置中实现了强大的有效性和兼容性，能够通过生成伪图像来持续学习新类别。

Conclusion: PMI和特征建模的结合有效解决了数据无关持续学习中模型反演的计算效率和特征对齐问题，为大型预训练模型的持续学习提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Continual learning (CL) aims to incrementally train a model on a sequence of
tasks while retaining performance on prior ones. However, storing and replaying
data is often infeasible due to privacy or security constraints and impractical
for arbitrary pre-trained models. Data-free CL seeks to update models without
access to previous data. Beyond regularization, we employ model inversion to
synthesize data from the trained model, enabling replay without storing
samples. Yet, model inversion in predictive models faces two challenges: (1)
generating inputs solely from compressed output labels causes drift between
synthetic and real data, and replaying such data can erode prior knowledge; (2)
inversion is computationally expensive since each step backpropagates through
the full model. These issues are amplified in large pre-trained models such as
CLIP. To improve efficiency, we propose Per-layer Model Inversion (PMI),
inspired by faster convergence in single-layer optimization. PMI provides
strong initialization for full-model inversion, substantially reducing
iterations. To mitigate feature shift, we model class-wise features via
Gaussian distributions and contrastive model, ensuring alignment between
synthetic and real features. Combining PMI and feature modeling, our approach
enables continual learning of new classes by generating pseudo-images from
semantic-aware projected features, achieving strong effectiveness and
compatibility across multiple CL settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是探索量子退火在SVM训练中的应用潜力，特别是研究参数离散化水平（比特数）如何影响模型性能，并比较量子方法与经典方法的优劣。

Method: 将SVM训练转化为QUBO问题，使用量子退火进行优化，研究不同比特精度（如1比特/参数）对模型性能的影响，并与经典LIBSVM求解器进行比较。

Result: 发现即使是低精度的QUBO编码（如1比特/参数）也能获得有竞争力甚至更优的准确率，增加比特深度虽然允许更大的正则化参数，但并不总能改善分类性能。

Conclusion: 选择合适的支持向量可能比精确的权重更重要，虽然当前硬件限制了可求解QUBO问题的规模，但研究结果显示了量子退火在SVM训练中的潜力。

Abstract: Training Support Vector Machines (SVMs) can be formulated as a QUBO problem,
enabling the use of quantum annealing for model optimization. In this work, we
study how the number of qubits - linked to the discretization level of dual
weights - affects predictive performance across datasets. We compare QUBO-based
SVM training to the classical LIBSVM solver and find that even low-precision
QUBO encodings (e.g., 1 bit per parameter) yield competitive, and sometimes
superior, accuracy. While increased bit-depth enables larger regularization
parameters, it does not always improve classification. Our findings suggest
that selecting the right support vectors may matter more than their precise
weighting. Although current hardware limits the size of solvable QUBOs, our
results highlight the potential of quantum annealing for efficient SVM training
as quantum devices scale.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种结合扩散模型和退火Langevin动力学的方法，在仅需L^4分数误差界的情况下实现多项式时间的条件采样，解决了传统方法对分数估计误差敏感的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 后验采样在图像修复、去模糊等任务中很重要，但近似后验采样在计算上通常是难解的。传统Langevin动力学对分数估计误差敏感，需要严格的MGF界，而扩散模型在无条件设置中仅需L^2误差界。

Method: 结合扩散模型与退火Langevin动力学，在log-concave分布条件下实现条件采样。该方法仅需L^4分数误差界，相比传统方法放宽了误差要求。

Result: 证明了该方法能够在多项式时间内实现条件采样，仅需L^4分数误差界，显著降低了分数估计的精度要求。

Conclusion: 该方法为后验采样提供了一种更实用和鲁棒的解决方案，放宽了对分数估计精度的要求，使条件采样在更宽松的条件下可行。

Abstract: Given a noisy linear measurement $y = Ax + \xi$ of a distribution $p(x)$, and
a good approximation to the prior $p(x)$, when can we sample from the posterior
$p(x \mid y)$? Posterior sampling provides an accurate and fair framework for
tasks such as inpainting, deblurring, and MRI reconstruction, and several
heuristics attempt to approximate it. Unfortunately, approximate posterior
sampling is computationally intractable in general.
  To sidestep this hardness, we focus on (local or global) log-concave
distributions $p(x)$. In this regime, Langevin dynamics yields posterior
samples when the exact scores of $p(x)$ are available, but it is brittle to
score--estimation error, requiring an MGF bound (sub-exponential error). By
contrast, in the unconditional setting, diffusion models succeed with only an
$L^2$ bound on the score error. We prove that combining diffusion models with
an annealed variant of Langevin dynamics achieves conditional sampling in
polynomial time using merely an $L^4$ bound on the score error.

Motivation: 研究Agent Skills框架的安全性，因为虽然该框架为LLM提供持续学习能力很有用，但其安全性尚未得到充分验证。

Method: 通过在长Agent Skill文件和引用脚本中隐藏恶意指令，演示如何绕过系统防护进行数据窃取，并利用"不再询问"选项的漏洞。

Result: 成功展示了Agent Skills框架存在根本性安全漏洞，能够轻易实施提示注入攻击，窃取内部文件和密码等敏感数据。

Conclusion: 尽管LLM能力不断提升，但在现实场景中仍然容易受到简单提示注入攻击，Agent Skills框架存在严重安全隐患。

Abstract: Enabling continual learning in LLMs remains a key unresolved research
challenge. In a recent announcement, a frontier LLM company made a step towards
this by introducing Agent Skills, a framework that equips agents with new
knowledge based on instructions stored in simple markdown files. Although Agent
Skills can be a very useful tool, we show that they are fundamentally insecure,
since they enable trivially simple prompt injections. We demonstrate how to
hide malicious instructions in long Agent Skill files and referenced scripts to
exfiltrate sensitive data, such as internal files or passwords. Importantly, we
show how to bypass system-level guardrails of a popular coding agent: a benign,
task-specific approval with the "Don't ask again" option can carry over to
closely related but harmful actions. Overall, we conclude that despite ongoing
research efforts and scaling model capabilities, frontier LLMs remain
vulnerable to very simple prompt injections in realistic scenarios. Our code is

Motivation: 现有因果发现方法只能施加结构约束，但可能得出与已知因果效应相反的结论。需要一种方法来明确约束变量对之间的总因果效应，确保模型尊重已知的因果影响。

Conclusion: 干预约束填补了因果发现中的重要空白，使模型更具可解释性，并为设计新治疗等下游任务提供了更可靠的因果模型。

Abstract: Incorporating causal knowledge and mechanisms is essential for refining
causal models and improving downstream tasks such as designing new treatments.
In this paper, we introduce a novel concept in causal discovery, termed
interventional constraints, which differs fundamentally from interventional
data. While interventional data require direct perturbations of variables,
interventional constraints encode high-level causal knowledge in the form of
inequality constraints on causal effects. For instance, in the Sachs dataset
(Sachs et al.\ 2005), Akt has been shown to be activated by PIP3, meaning PIP3
exerts a positive causal effect on Akt. Existing causal discovery methods allow
enforcing structural constraints (for example, requiring a causal path from
PIP3 to Akt), but they may still produce incorrect causal conclusions such as
learning that "PIP3 inhibits Akt". Interventional constraints bridge this gap
by explicitly constraining the total causal effect between variable pairs,
ensuring learned models respect known causal influences. To formalize
interventional constraints, we propose a metric to quantify total causal
effects for linear causal models and formulate the problem as a constrained
optimization task, solved using a two-stage constrained optimization method. We
evaluate our approach on real-world datasets and demonstrate that integrating
interventional constraints not only improves model accuracy and ensures
consistency with established findings, making models more explainable, but also
facilitates the discovery of new causal relationships that would otherwise be
costly to identify.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms are designed to optimize
problem-solving by learning actions that maximize rewards, a task that becomes
particularly challenging in random and nonstationary environments. Even
advanced RL algorithms are often limited in their ability to solve problems in
these conditions. In applications such as searching for underwater pollution
clouds with autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs), RL algorithms must navigate
reward-sparse environments, where actions frequently result in a zero reward.
This paper aims to address these challenges by revisiting and modifying
classical RL approaches to efficiently operate in sparse, randomized, and
nonstationary environments. We systematically study a large number of
modifications, including hierarchical algorithm changes, multigoal learning,
and the integration of a location memory as an external output filter to
prevent state revisits. Our results demonstrate that a modified Monte
Carlo-based approach significantly outperforms traditional Q-learning and two
exhaustive search patterns, illustrating its potential in adapting RL to
complex environments. These findings suggest that reinforcement learning
approaches can be effectively adapted for use in random, nonstationary, and
reward-sparse environments.

Motivation: 现有联邦学习方法仅支持同族模型变体，无法处理CNN、GNN、MLP等根本不同的网络架构，且忽视测试时数据分布差异导致的领域碎片化问题。

Method: 将异构本地网络表示为有向模型图中的节点和边，使用共享GNN优化；引入距离驱动聚类和双层聚合策略平衡收敛与多样性。

Result: 在MedMNIST分类和海马体分割基准测试中表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: UnifiedFL能有效处理联邦学习中的架构异质性和领域碎片化挑战，提升模型泛化能力。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) has emerged as a key paradigm for collaborative model
training across multiple clients without sharing raw data, enabling
privacy-preserving applications in areas such as radiology and pathology.
However, works on collaborative training across clients with fundamentally
different neural architectures and non-identically distributed datasets remain
scarce. Existing FL frameworks face several limitations. Despite claiming to
support architectural heterogeneity, most recent FL methods only tolerate
variants within a single model family (e.g., shallower, deeper, or wider CNNs),
still presuming a shared global architecture and failing to accommodate
federations where clients deploy fundamentally different network types (e.g.,
CNNs, GNNs, MLPs). Moreover, existing approaches often address only statistical
heterogeneity while overlooking the domain-fracture problem, where each
client's data distribution differs markedly from that faced at testing time,
undermining model generalizability. When clients use different architectures,
have non-identically distributed data, and encounter distinct test domains,
current methods perform poorly. To address these challenges, we propose
UnifiedFL, a dynamic federated learning framework that represents heterogeneous
local networks as nodes and edges in a directed model graph optimized by a
shared graph neural network (GNN). UnifiedFL introduces (i) a common GNN to
parameterize all architectures, (ii) distance-driven clustering via Euclidean
distances between clients' parameters, and (iii) a two-tier aggregation policy
balancing convergence and diversity. Experiments on MedMNIST classification and
hippocampus segmentation benchmarks demonstrate UnifiedFL's superior
performance. Code and data: https://github.com/basiralab/UnifiedFL

Conclusion: 通过整合预测性能、可靠性估计和基于规则的推理，该框架推进了透明和可审计的金融AI系统。

Abstract: Financial forecasting increasingly uses large neural network models, but
their opacity raises challenges for trust and regulatory compliance. We present
several approaches to explainable and reliable AI in finance. \emph{First}, we
describe how Time-LLM, a time series foundation model, uses a prompt to avoid a
wrong directional forecast. \emph{Second}, we show that combining foundation
models for time series forecasting with a reliability estimator can filter our
unreliable predictions. \emph{Third}, we argue for symbolic reasoning encoding
domain rules for transparent justification. These approaches shift emphasize
executing only forecasts that are both reliable and explainable. Experiments on
equity and cryptocurrency data show that the architecture reduces false
positives and supports selective execution. By integrating predictive
performance with reliability estimation and rule-based reasoning, our framework
advances transparent and auditable financial AI systems.

Motivation: 工业场所中工人定位数据对提高生产力至关重要。虽然摄像头能提供环境上下文信息，但仅靠视觉数据识别个体通常不实用。现有方法在真实条件下可能失效。

Method: 1. 深度学习模型预测轨迹与传感器测量的对应概率和可靠性；2. 算法使用预测的概率和可靠性随时间匹配轨迹和传感器测量。

Result: 基于实际仓库操作开发数据集，证明了该方法在真实应用中的有效性。

Conclusion: CorVS是一种新颖的数据驱动人员识别方法，通过视觉轨迹与传感器测量的对应关系，克服了现有方法在真实条件下的局限性。

Abstract: Worker location data is key to higher productivity in industrial sites.
Cameras are a promising tool for localization in logistics warehouses since
they also offer valuable environmental contexts such as package status.
However, identifying individuals with only visual data is often impractical.
Accordingly, several prior studies identified people in videos by comparing
their trajectories and wearable sensor measurements. While this approach has
advantages such as independence from appearance, the existing methods may break
down under real-world conditions. To overcome this challenge, we propose CorVS,
a novel data-driven person identification method based on correspondence
between visual tracking trajectories and sensor measurements. Firstly, our deep
learning model predicts correspondence probabilities and reliabilities for
every pair of a trajectory and sensor measurements. Secondly, our algorithm
matches the trajectories and sensor measurements over time using the predicted
probabilities and reliabilities. We developed a dataset with actual warehouse
operations and demonstrated the method's effectiveness for real-world
applications.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 开发基于Flow Matching的生成式AI模型FM-Cast，用于高效准确地对平流层环流进行概率性预报，在18次主要SSW事件中表现优异，计算效率远超传统数值天气预报系统。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 平流层突然增温(SSW)是次季节可预报性的关键来源和极端冬季天气的主要驱动因素，但传统数值天气预报系统在物理表示、初始化和计算需求方面存在局限，而数据驱动方法在SSW的复杂三维动力学特别是概率预报方面应用不足。

Method: 采用基于Flow Matching的生成式AI模型FM-Cast，构建高效的平流层环流时空演变的概率预报系统，通过理想化实验分析SSW可预报性与物理驱动因素的关系。

Result: 在1998-2024年的18次主要SSW事件中，FM-Cast能提前20天准确预报10次事件的开始、强度和形态，集合准确率超过50%，性能媲美或优于领先的NWP系统，在消费级GPU上仅需2分钟完成50成员30天预报。

Conclusion: 本研究建立了计算高效的平流层异常概率预报新范式，展示了生成式AI在加深对大气-气候动力学物理理解方面的潜力，揭示了SSW可预报性与其物理驱动因素的根本联系。

Abstract: Sudden Stratospheric Warmings (SSWs) are key sources of subseasonal
predictability and major drivers of extreme winter weather. Yet, their accurate
and efficient forecast remains a persistent challenge for numerical weather
prediction (NWP) systems due to limitations in physical representation,
initialization, and the immense computational demands of ensemble forecasts.
While data-driven forecasting is rapidly evolving, its application to the
complex, three-dimensional dynamics of SSWs, particularly for probabilistic
forecast, remains underexplored. Here, we bridge this gap by developing a Flow
Matching-based generative AI model (FM-Cast) for efficient and skillful
probabilistic forecasting of the spatiotemporal evolution of stratospheric
circulation. Evaluated across 18 major SSW events (1998-2024), FM-Cast
skillfully forecasts the onset, intensity, and morphology of 10 events up to 20
days in advance, achieving ensemble accuracies above 50%. Its performance is
comparable to or exceeds leading NWP systems while requiring only two minutes
for a 50-member, 30-day forecast on a consumer GPU. Furthermore, leveraging
FM-Cast as a scientific tool, we demonstrate through idealized experiments that
SSW predictability is fundamentally linked to its underlying physical drivers,
distinguishing between events forced from the troposphere and those driven by
internal stratospheric dynamics. Our work thus establishes a computationally
efficient paradigm for probabilistic forecasting stratospheric anomalies and
showcases generative AI's potential to deepen the physical understanding of
atmosphere-climate dynamics.

Conclusion: 该方法通过自适应上下文长度优化和有效信息表示，显著提升了多智能体强化学习的探索效率和收敛性能。

Abstract: Recently, deep multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) has demonstrated
promising performance for solving challenging tasks, such as long-term
dependencies and non-Markovian environments. Its success is partly attributed
to conditioning policies on large fixed context length. However, such large
fixed context lengths may lead to limited exploration efficiency and redundant
information. In this paper, we propose a novel MARL framework to obtain
adaptive and effective contextual information. Specifically, we design a
central agent that dynamically optimizes context length via temporal gradient
analysis, enhancing exploration to facilitate convergence to global optima in
MARL. Furthermore, to enhance the adaptive optimization capability of the
context length, we present an efficient input representation for the central
agent, which effectively filters redundant information. By leveraging a
Fourier-based low-frequency truncation method, we extract global temporal
trends across decentralized agents, providing an effective and efficient
representation of the MARL environment. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on long-term
dependency tasks, including PettingZoo, MiniGrid, Google Research Football
(GRF), and StarCraft Multi-Agent Challenge v2 (SMACv2).

Abstract: Multi-task learning (MTL) enables simultaneous training across related tasks,
leveraging shared information to improve generalization, efficiency, and
robustness, especially in data-scarce or high-dimensional scenarios. While deep

Motivation: 现有方法采用两阶段训练潜在动作模型和世界模型，导致训练冗余且限制了协同适应潜力。直接联合训练虽然概念简单但容易导致表示崩溃。

Method: 提出CoLA-World框架，通过关键的预热阶段有效对齐从零开始训练的潜在动作模型与预训练世界模型的表示，实现协同进化循环。

Result: 在视频模拟质量和下游视觉规划任务中，CoLA-World匹配或超越了先前的两阶段方法。

Conclusion: CoLA-World为领域建立了一个稳健高效的新范式，实现了潜在动作模型与世界模型的成功联合训练。

Abstract: Adapting pre-trained video generation models into controllable world models
via latent actions is a promising step towards creating generalist world
models. The dominant paradigm adopts a two-stage approach that trains latent
action model (LAM) and the world model separately, resulting in redundant
training and limiting their potential for co-adaptation. A conceptually simple
and appealing idea is to directly replace the forward dynamic model in LAM with
a powerful world model and training them jointly, but it is non-trivial and
prone to representational collapse. In this work, we propose CoLA-World, which
for the first time successfully realizes this synergistic paradigm, resolving
the core challenge in joint learning through a critical warm-up phase that
effectively aligns the representations of the from-scratch LAM with the
pre-trained world model. This unlocks a co-evolution cycle: the world model
acts as a knowledgeable tutor, providing gradients to shape a high-quality LAM,
while the LAM offers a more precise and adaptable control interface to the
world model. Empirically, CoLA-World matches or outperforms prior two-stage
methods in both video simulation quality and downstream visual planning,
establishing a robust and efficient new paradigm for the field.

Conclusion: CFKD-AFN能有效利用低保真度数据增强高保真度预测性能，并可通过可解释变体探索潜在医学语义以支持临床决策。

Abstract: Personalized treatment outcome prediction based on trial data for
small-sample and rare patient groups is critical in precision medicine.
However, the costly trial data limit the prediction performance. To address
this issue, we propose a cross-fidelity knowledge distillation and adaptive
fusion network (CFKD-AFN), which leverages abundant but low-fidelity simulation
data to enhance predictions on scarce but high-fidelity trial data. CFKD-AFN
incorporates a dual-channel knowledge distillation module to extract
complementary knowledge from the low-fidelity model, along with an
attention-guided fusion module to dynamically integrate multi-source
information. Experiments on treatment outcome prediction for the chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease demonstrates significant improvements of CFKD-AFN
over state-of-the-art methods in prediction accuracy, ranging from 6.67\% to
74.55\%, and strong robustness to varying high-fidelity dataset sizes.
Furthermore, we extend CFKD-AFN to an interpretable variant, enabling the
exploration of latent medical semantics to support clinical decision-making.

Motivation: 现有图压缩方法在原始图被破坏时性能显著下降，而现有鲁棒图学习技术效果有限。研究发现图压缩本质上是内在维度降低过程，但这一特性对对抗扰动高度脆弱。

Method: 提出MRGC框架，引入三个图数据流形学习模块，引导压缩图位于平滑、低维流形上，最小化类别模糊性，保持分类复杂性降低能力。

Conclusion: 通过几何视角和流形约束，MRGC成功解决了图压缩的脆弱性问题，在对抗攻击下保持鲁棒性能。

Abstract: Graph condensation (GC) has gained significant attention for its ability to
synthesize smaller yet informative graphs. However, existing studies often
overlook the robustness of GC in scenarios where the original graph is
corrupted. In such cases, we observe that the performance of GC deteriorates
significantly, while existing robust graph learning technologies offer only
limited effectiveness. Through both empirical investigation and theoretical
analysis, we reveal that GC is inherently an intrinsic-dimension-reducing
process, synthesizing a condensed graph with lower classification complexity.
Although this property is critical for effective GC performance, it remains
highly vulnerable to adversarial perturbations. To tackle this vulnerability
and improve GC robustness, we adopt the geometry perspective of graph data
manifold and propose a novel Manifold-constrained Robust Graph Condensation
framework named MRGC. Specifically, we introduce three graph data manifold
learning modules that guide the condensed graph to lie within a smooth,
low-dimensional manifold with minimal class ambiguity, thereby preserving the
classification complexity reduction capability of GC and ensuring robust
performance under universal adversarial attacks. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the robustness of \ModelName\ across diverse attack scenarios.

Abstract: Anomaly detection in time-series data is a critical challenge with
significant implications for network security. Recent quantum machine learning
approaches, such as quantum kernel methods and variational quantum circuits,
have shown promise in capturing complex data distributions for anomaly
detection but remain constrained by limited qubit counts. We introduce in this
work a novel Quantum Gated Recurrent Unit (QGRU)-based Generative Adversarial
Network (GAN) employing Successive Data Injection (SuDaI) and a multi-metric
gating strategy for robust network anomaly detection. Our model uniquely
utilizes a quantum-enhanced generator that outputs parameters (mean and
log-variance) of a Gaussian distribution via reparameterization, combined with
a Wasserstein critic to stabilize adversarial training. Anomalies are
identified through a novel gating mechanism that initially flags potential
anomalies based on Gaussian uncertainty estimates and subsequently verifies
them using a composite of critic scores and reconstruction errors. Evaluated on
benchmark datasets, our method achieves a high time-series aware F1 score
(TaF1) of 89.43% demonstrating superior capability in detecting anomalies
accurately and promptly as compared to existing classical and quantum models.
Furthermore, the trained QGRU-WGAN was deployed on real IBM Quantum hardware,
where it retained high anomaly detection performance, confirming its robustness
and practical feasibility on current noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ)
devices.

Motivation: 当前RLVR中的数据选择方法主要是启发式的，缺乏理论保证和泛化性，需要一种理论支撑的数据选择方法来提升大型语言模型的推理能力训练效率。

Abstract: Data selection is a critical aspect of Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable
Rewards (RLVR) for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language
models (LLMs). Current data selection methods are largely heuristic-based,
lacking theoretical guarantees and generalizability. This work proposes a
theoretically-grounded approach using influence functions to estimate the
contribution of each data point to the learning objective. To overcome the
prohibitive computational cost of policy rollouts required for online influence
estimation, we introduce an off-policy influence estimation method that
efficiently approximates data influence using pre-collected offline
trajectories. Furthermore, to manage the high-dimensional gradients of LLMs, we
employ sparse random projection to reduce dimensionality and improve storage
and computation efficiency. Leveraging these techniques, we develop
\textbf{C}urriculum \textbf{R}L with \textbf{O}ff-\textbf{P}olicy
\text{I}nfluence guidance (\textbf{CROPI}), a multi-stage RL framework that
iteratively selects the most influential data for the current policy.
Experiments on models up to 7B parameters demonstrate that CROPI significantly
accelerates training. On a 1.5B model, it achieves a 2.66x step-level
acceleration while using only 10\% of the data per stage compared to
full-dataset training. Our results highlight the substantial potential of
influence-based data selection for efficient RLVR.

Motivation: 可穿戴设备ECG监测面临分布外数据的可靠性挑战，现有方法要么忽略计算约束，要么分别处理噪声和未见类别，需要一种独立的上游过滤机制来改善鲁棒性。

Method: 使用神经架构搜索优化六种无监督异常检测方法（Deep SVDD、重建模型、掩码异常检测、标准化流、扩散模型），在严格资源约束下（最多512k参数）进行基准测试。

Result: Deep SVDD在检测性能和效率之间达到最佳平衡。在实际部署模拟中，将优化的Deep SVDD过滤器与诊断分类器集成，相比仅使用分类器的基线，准确率提高了最多21个百分点。

Conclusion: 优化的UAD过滤器能够保护自动化ECG分析，使可穿戴设备上的连续心血管监测更加安全可靠。

Abstract: Continuous electrocardiogram (ECG) monitoring via wearables offers
significant potential for early cardiovascular disease (CVD) detection.
However, deploying deep learning models for automated analysis in
resource-constrained environments faces reliability challenges due to
inevitable Out-of-Distribution (OOD) data. OOD inputs, such as unseen
pathologies or noisecorrupted signals, often cause erroneous, high-confidence
predictions by standard classifiers, compromising patient safety. Existing OOD
detection methods either neglect computational constraints or address noise and
unseen classes separately. This paper explores Unsupervised Anomaly Detection
(UAD) as an independent, upstream filtering mechanism to improve robustness. We
benchmark six UAD approaches, including Deep SVDD, reconstruction-based models,
Masked Anomaly Detection, normalizing flows, and diffusion models, optimized
via Neural Architecture Search (NAS) under strict resource constraints (at most
512k parameters). Evaluation on PTB-XL and BUT QDB datasets assessed detection
of OOD CVD classes and signals unsuitable for analysis due to noise. Results
show Deep SVDD consistently achieves the best trade-off between detection and
efficiency. In a realistic deployment simulation, integrating the optimized
Deep SVDD filter with a diagnostic classifier improved accuracy by up to 21
percentage points over a classifier-only baseline. This study demonstrates that
optimized UAD filters can safeguard automated ECG analysis, enabling safer,
more reliable continuous cardiovascular monitoring on wearables.

TL;DR: LLMs can serve as in-context meta-learners for model and hyperparameter selection by converting datasets into metadata and prompting LLMs to recommend competitive configurations without expensive search.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Model and hyperparameter selection typically requires expert intuition or expensive automated search, which is challenging in machine learning.

Method: Convert datasets into interpretable metadata and prompt LLMs using two strategies: zero-shot mode relying on pretrained knowledge, and meta-informed mode augmented with examples of models and their past performance.

Result: LLMs can exploit dataset metadata to recommend competitive models and hyperparameters without search across synthetic and real-world benchmarks, with improvements from meta-informed prompting demonstrating in-context meta-learning capacity.

Conclusion: LLMs show promise as lightweight, general-purpose assistants for model selection and hyperparameter optimization.

Abstract: Model and hyperparameter selection are critical but challenging in machine
learning, typically requiring expert intuition or expensive automated search.
We investigate whether large language models (LLMs) can act as in-context
meta-learners for this task. By converting each dataset into interpretable
metadata, we prompt an LLM to recommend both model families and
hyperparameters. We study two prompting strategies: (1) a zero-shot mode
relying solely on pretrained knowledge, and (2) a meta-informed mode augmented
with examples of models and their performance on past tasks. Across synthetic
and real-world benchmarks, we show that LLMs can exploit dataset metadata to
recommend competitive models and hyperparameters without search, and that
improvements from meta-informed prompting demonstrate their capacity for
in-context meta-learning. These results highlight a promising new role for LLMs
as lightweight, general-purpose assistants for model selection and
hyperparameter optimization.

Result: 在数学推理基准测试中，ICPO持续提升了强化学习性能和训练稳定性。

Conclusion: ICPO为LRMs提供了一个可扩展且有效的RLVR范式。

Abstract: Existing Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) methods, such
as Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), have achieved remarkable progress
in improving the reasoning capabilities of Large Reasoning Models (LRMs).
However, they exhibit limited exploration due to reliance on on-policy rollouts
where confined to the current policy's distribution, resulting in narrow
trajectory diversity. Recent approaches attempt to expand policy coverage by
incorporating trajectories generated from stronger expert models, yet this
reliance increases computational cost and such advaned models are often
inaccessible. To address these issues, we propose In-Context Steered Policy
Optimization (ICPO), a unified framework that leverages the inherent in-context
learning capability of LRMs to provide expert guidance using existing datasets.
ICPO introduces Mixed-Policy GRPO with Implicit Expert Forcing, which expands
exploration beyond the current policy distribution without requiring advanced
LRM trajectories. To further stabilize optimization, ICPO integrates Expert
Region Reject Sampling to filter unreliable off-policy trajectories and
Annealed Expert-Bonus Reward Shaping to balance early expert guidance with
later autonomous improvement. Results demonstrate that ICPO consistently
enhances reinforcement learning performance and training stability on
mathematical reasoning benchmarks, revealing a scalable and effective RLVR
paradigm for LRMs.

Conclusion: 多基础推测解码框架在理论和实践上均优于传统二元方法，为加速LLM推理提供了新的理论基础和实现方案。

Abstract: Inference latency stands as a critical bottleneck in the large-scale
deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs). Speculative decoding methods have
recently shown promise in accelerating inference without compromising the
output distribution. However, existing work typically relies on a dualistic
draft-verify framework and lacks rigorous theoretical grounding. In this paper,
we introduce a novel \emph{polybasic} speculative decoding framework,
underpinned by a comprehensive theoretical analysis. Specifically, we prove a
fundamental theorem that characterizes the optimal inference time for
multi-model speculative decoding systems, shedding light on how to extend
beyond the dualistic approach to a more general polybasic paradigm. Through our
theoretical investigation of multi-model token generation, we expose and
optimize the interplay between model capabilities, acceptance lengths, and
overall computational cost. Our framework supports both standalone
implementation and integration with existing speculative techniques, leading to
accelerated performance in practice. Experimental results across multiple model
families demonstrate that our approach yields speedup ratios ranging from
$3.31\times$ to $4.01\times$ for LLaMA2-Chat 7B, up to $3.87 \times$ for
LLaMA3-8B, up to $4.43 \times$ for Vicuna-7B and up to $3.85 \times$ for
Qwen2-7B -- all while preserving the original output distribution. We release
our theoretical proofs and implementation code to facilitate further
investigation into polybasic speculative decoding.

Motivation: 扩展HOHL的理论基础，证明其截断版本的一致性并推导收敛率，验证其在更广泛学习场景中的适用性。

Method: 使用截断的高阶超图学习作为正则化器，在完全监督学习中分析其理论性质，并在主动学习和非几何结构数据集上进行实证验证。

Conclusion: HOHL在多样化学习环境中展现出良好的通用性和鲁棒性，为超图学习提供了坚实的理论基础和实用价值。

Abstract: Higher-Order Hypergraph Learning (HOHL) was recently introduced as a
principled alternative to classical hypergraph regularization, enforcing
higher-order smoothness via powers of multiscale Laplacians induced by the
hypergraph structure. Prior work established the well- and ill-posedness of
HOHL through an asymptotic consistency analysis in geometric settings. We
extend this theoretical foundation by proving the consistency of a truncated
version of HOHL and deriving explicit convergence rates when HOHL is used as a
regularizer in fully supervised learning. We further demonstrate its strong
empirical performance in active learning and in datasets lacking an underlying
geometric structure, highlighting HOHL's versatility and robustness across
diverse learning settings.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出一种三阶段贝叶斯域对抗神经网络框架，结合参数迁移和共享潜在空间适应，在领域转移大的情况下提高预测精度和不确定性量化能力


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统深度神经网络需要大量高质量数据，但实验数据往往稀疏、有噪声或不足。参数迁移方法在领域转移大时性能下降，域对抗神经网络虽能改善但训练不稳定且缺乏不确定性量化

Method: 三阶段框架：1）在源域训练确定性特征提取器；2）使用DANN对抗性精炼特征提取器；3）在适应后的特征提取器上构建贝叶斯神经网络，在目标域上进行微调

Result: 在合成基准测试中显著优于标准迁移技术，在矩形通道临界热通量预测任务中提高了预测精度和泛化能力

Conclusion: staged B-DANN方法能改善预测精度和泛化能力，可能有助于核工程等其他领域

Abstract: The use of ML in engineering has grown steadily to support a wide array of
applications. Among these methods, deep neural networks have been widely
adopted due to their performance and accessibility, but they require large,
high-quality datasets. Experimental data are often sparse, noisy, or
insufficient to build resilient data-driven models. Transfer learning, which
leverages relevant data-abundant source domains to assist learning in
data-scarce target domains, has shown efficacy. Parameter transfer, where
pretrained weights are reused, is common but degrades under large domain
shifts. Domain-adversarial neural networks (DANNs) help address this issue by
learning domain-invariant representations, thereby improving transfer under
greater domain shifts in a semi-supervised setting. However, DANNs can be
unstable during training and lack a native means for uncertainty
quantification. This study introduces a fully-supervised three-stage framework,
the staged Bayesian domain-adversarial neural network (staged B-DANN), that
combines parameter transfer and shared latent space adaptation. In Stage 1, a
deterministic feature extractor is trained on the source domain. This feature
extractor is then adversarially refined using a DANN in Stage 2. In Stage 3, a
Bayesian neural network is built on the adapted feature extractor for
fine-tuning on the target domain to handle conditional shifts and yield
calibrated uncertainty estimates. This staged B-DANN approach was first
validated on a synthetic benchmark, where it was shown to significantly
outperform standard transfer techniques. It was then applied to the task of
predicting critical heat flux in rectangular channels, leveraging data from
tube experiments as the source domain. The results of this study show that the
staged B-DANN method can improve predictive accuracy and generalization,
potentially assisting other domains in nuclear engineering.

Motivation: 在计算受限的物联网设备上部署机器学习模型的需求日益增长，需要轻量级模型来支持设备在无持续通信或外部供电情况下的自主运行。

Method: 采用奖励特征和阈值重用的训练技术，结合改进的训练过程和替代内存布局，训练紧凑的提升决策树集成模型。

Abstract: Deploying machine learning models on compute-constrained devices has become a
key building block of modern IoT applications. In this work, we present a
compression scheme for boosted decision trees, addressing the growing need for
lightweight machine learning models. Specifically, we provide techniques for
training compact boosted decision tree ensembles that exhibit a reduced memory
footprint by rewarding, among other things, the reuse of features and
thresholds during training. Our experimental evaluation shows that models
achieved the same performance with a compression ratio of 4-16x compared to
LightGBM models using an adapted training process and an alternative memory
layout. Once deployed, the corresponding IoT devices can operate independently
of constant communication or external energy supply, and, thus, autonomously,
requiring only minimal computing power and energy. This capability opens the
door to a wide range of IoT applications, including remote monitoring, edge
analytics, and real-time decision making in isolated or power-limited
environments.

### [86] [On Measuring Localization of Shortcuts in Deep Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26560)
*Nikita Tsoy,Nikola Konstantinov*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文研究了深度网络中捷径学习（shortcut learning）的层间分布特性，发现捷径特征并非集中在特定层，而是分布在网络各层中，浅层主要编码虚假特征，深层主要遗忘核心特征。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 捷径（虚假规则）在训练时表现良好但泛化能力差，严重影响深度网络的可靠性。目前对捷径在特征表示中影响的研究不足，阻碍了设计原则性捷径缓解方法。

Method: 通过新颖的实验设计量化由捷径诱导偏差导致的层间准确率退化贡献，采用反事实训练方法在干净和偏差数据集上进行对比研究，在CIFAR-10、Waterbirds和CelebA数据集上测试VGG、ResNet、DeiT和ConvNeXt架构。

Result: 发现捷径学习不局限于特定层，而是分布在整个网络中：浅层主要编码虚假特征，深层主要遗忘在干净数据上具有预测能力的核心特征。分析了定位差异的主要变化轴。

Conclusion: 层间捷径缓解策略的分析表明设计通用方法很困难，支持采用数据集和架构特定的方法。

Abstract: Shortcuts, spurious rules that perform well during training but fail to
generalize, present a major challenge to the reliability of deep networks
(Geirhos et al., 2020). However, the impact of shortcuts on feature
representations remains understudied, obstructing the design of principled
shortcut-mitigation methods. To overcome this limitation, we investigate the
layer-wise localization of shortcuts in deep models. Our novel experiment
design quantifies the layer-wise contribution to accuracy degradation caused by
a shortcut-inducing skew by counterfactual training on clean and skewed
datasets. We employ our design to study shortcuts on CIFAR-10, Waterbirds, and
CelebA datasets across VGG, ResNet, DeiT, and ConvNeXt architectures. We find
that shortcut learning is not localized in specific layers but distributed
throughout the network. Different network parts play different roles in this
process: shallow layers predominantly encode spurious features, while deeper
layers predominantly forget core features that are predictive on clean data. We
also analyze the differences in localization and describe its principal axes of
variation. Finally, our analysis of layer-wise shortcut-mitigation strategies
suggests the hardness of designing general methods, supporting dataset- and
architecture-specific approaches instead.

Conclusion: 局部校准方法能够有效解决多分类校准中的邻近性偏差问题，为高风险应用场景提供了更可靠的校准保障。

Abstract: Developing trustworthy Machine Learning (ML) models requires their predicted
probabilities to be well-calibrated, meaning they should reflect true-class
frequencies. Among calibration notions in multiclass classification, strong
calibration is the most stringent, as it requires all predicted probabilities
to be simultaneously calibrated across all classes. However, existing
approaches to multiclass calibration lack a notion of distance among inputs,
which makes them vulnerable to proximity bias: predictions in sparse regions of
the feature space are systematically miscalibrated. This is especially relevant
in high-stakes settings, such as healthcare, where the sparse instances are
exactly those most at risk of biased treatment. In this work, we address this
main shortcoming by introducing a local perspective on multiclass calibration.
First, we formally define multiclass local calibration and establish its
relationship with strong calibration. Second, we theoretically analyze the
pitfalls of existing evaluation metrics when applied to multiclass local
calibration. Third, we propose a practical method for enhancing local
calibration in Neural Networks, which enforces alignment between predicted
probabilities and local estimates of class frequencies using the Jensen-Shannon
distance. Finally, we empirically validate our approach against existing
multiclass calibration techniques.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合Bernstein基参数化和Wasserstein距离最小化的分布回归方法，通过高斯分量构建平滑概率轨迹，在保持几何准确性的同时提高计算效率和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有分布回归方法要么忽略概率空间的几何结构，要么计算成本过高，需要一种兼顾几何准确性和计算实用性的新方法。

Method: 使用Bernstein多项式构建高斯分量的均值和协方差函数，通过最小化预测分布与经验数据之间的Wasserstein距离来训练模型，采用自动微分优化。

Result: 在包含复杂轨迹的合成数据集上，该方法在Wasserstein距离、能量距离和RMSE指标上表现出有竞争力的逼近质量，特别是在非线性明显的情况下，轨迹平滑度和鲁棒性优于或与替代方法相当。

Conclusion: 该方法在几何准确性、计算实用性和可解释性之间取得了平衡，未来可扩展到非高斯分布、应用熵正则化加速计算，并适应高维数据近似更复杂的结构。

Abstract: This paper considers the problem of regression over distributions, which is
becoming increasingly important in machine learning. Existing approaches often
ignore the geometry of the probability space or are computationally expensive.
To overcome these limitations, a new method is proposed that combines the
parameterization of probability trajectories using a Bernstein basis and the
minimization of the Wasserstein distance between distributions. The key idea is
to model a conditional distribution as a smooth probability trajectory defined
by a weighted sum of Gaussian components whose parameters -- the mean and
covariance -- are functions of the input variable constructed using Bernstein
polynomials. The loss function is the averaged squared Wasserstein distance
between the predicted Gaussian distributions and the empirical data, which
takes into account the geometry of the distributions. An autodiff-based
optimization method is used to train the model. Experiments on synthetic
datasets that include complex trajectories demonstrated that the proposed
method provides competitive approximation quality in terms of the Wasserstein
distance, Energy Distance, and RMSE metrics, especially in cases of pronounced
nonlinearity. The model demonstrates trajectory smoothness that is better than
or comparable to alternatives and robustness to changes in data structure,
while maintaining high interpretability due to explicit parameterization via
control points. The developed approach represents a balanced solution that
combines geometric accuracy, computational practicality, and interpretability.
Prospects for further research include extending the method to non-Gaussian
distributions, applying entropy regularization to speed up computations, and
adapting the approach to working with high-dimensional data for approximating
surfaces and more complex structures.

Abstract: We introduce Aeolus, a large-scale Multi-modal Flight Delay Dataset designed
to advance research on flight delay prediction and support the development of
foundation models for tabular data. Existing datasets in this domain are
typically limited to flat tabular structures and fail to capture the
spatiotemporal dynamics inherent in delay propagation. Aeolus addresses this
limitation by providing three aligned modalities: (i) a tabular dataset with
rich operational, meteorological, and airportlevel features for over 50 million
flights; (ii) a flight chain module that models delay propagation along
sequential flight legs, capturing upstream and downstream dependencies; and
(iii) a flight network graph that encodes shared aircraft, crew, and airport
resource connections, enabling cross-flight relational reasoning. The dataset
is carefully constructed with temporal splits, comprehensive features, and
strict leakage prevention to support realistic and reproducible machine
learning evaluation. Aeolus supports a broad range of tasks, including
regression, classification, temporal structure modeling, and graph learning,
serving as a unified benchmark across tabular, sequential, and graph
modalities. We release baseline experiments and preprocessing tools to
facilitate adoption. Aeolus fills a key gap for both domain-specific modeling
and general-purpose structured data research.Our source code and data can be

Abstract: Bayesian Optimization (BO) has the potential to solve various combinatorial
tasks, ranging from materials science to neural architecture search. However,
BO requires specialized kernels to effectively model combinatorial domains.
Recent efforts have introduced several combinatorial kernels, but the
relationships among them are not well understood. To bridge this gap, we
develop a unifying framework based on heat kernels, which we derive in a
systematic way and express as simple closed-form expressions. Using this
framework, we prove that many successful combinatorial kernels are either
related or equivalent to heat kernels, and validate this theoretical claim in
our experiments. Moreover, our analysis confirms and extends the results
presented in Bounce: certain algorithms' performance decreases substantially
when the unknown optima of the function do not have a certain structure. In
contrast, heat kernels are not sensitive to the location of the optima. Lastly,
we show that a fast and simple pipeline, relying on heat kernels, is able to
achieve state-of-the-art results, matching or even outperforming certain slow
or complex algorithms.

Abstract: Anomaly detection is a fundamental task for time series analytics with
important implications for the downstream performance of many applications.
Despite increasing academic interest and the large number of methods proposed
in the literature, recent benchmarks and evaluation studies demonstrated that
no overall best anomaly detection methods exist when applied to very
heterogeneous time series datasets. Therefore, the only scalable and viable
solution to solve anomaly detection over very different time series collected
from diverse domains is to propose a model selection method that will select,
based on time series characteristics, the best anomaly detection methods to
run. Existing AutoML solutions are, unfortunately, not directly applicable to
time series anomaly detection, and no evaluation of time series-based
approaches for model selection exists. Towards that direction, this paper
studies the performance of time series classification methods used as model
selection for anomaly detection. In total, we evaluate 234 model configurations
derived from 16 base classifiers across more than 1980 time series, and we
propose the first extensive experimental evaluation of time series
classification as model selection for anomaly detection. Our results
demonstrate that model selection methods outperform every single anomaly
detection method while being in the same order of magnitude regarding execution
time. This evaluation is the first step to demonstrate the accuracy and
efficiency of time series classification algorithms for anomaly detection, and
represents a strong baseline that can then be used to guide the model selection
step in general AutoML pipelines. Preprint version of an article accepted at

Conclusion: Curly-FM扩展了流匹配模型的能力，使其能够建模物理系统中已知的周期性行为，超越了仅对群体建模的限制。

Abstract: Modeling the transport dynamics of natural processes from population-level
observations is a ubiquitous problem in the natural sciences. Such models rely
on key assumptions about the underlying process in order to enable faithful
learning of governing dynamics that mimic the actual system behavior. The de
facto assumption in current approaches relies on the principle of least action
that results in gradient field dynamics and leads to trajectories minimizing an
energy functional between two probability measures. However, many real-world
systems, such as cell cycles in single-cell RNA, are known to exhibit
non-gradient, periodic behavior, which fundamentally cannot be captured by
current state-of-the-art methods such as flow and bridge matching. In this
paper, we introduce Curly Flow Matching (Curly-FM), a novel approach that is
capable of learning non-gradient field dynamics by designing and solving a
Schr\"odinger bridge problem with a non-zero drift reference process -- in
stark contrast to typical zero-drift reference processes -- which is
constructed using inferred velocities in addition to population snapshot data.
We showcase Curly-FM by solving the trajectory inference problems for single
cells, computational fluid dynamics, and ocean currents with approximate
velocities. We demonstrate that Curly-FM can learn trajectories that better
match both the reference process and population marginals. Curly-FM expands
flow matching models beyond the modeling of populations and towards the
modeling of known periodic behavior in physical systems. Our code repository is

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决Hardt和Roth提出的问题，改进现有私有算法在稠密设置下的性能，特别是在单峰PCA Wishart模型中达到最优非私有算法的保证。

Method: 使用奇异值分解和标准扰动机制构建私有秩r近似，证明高斯扰动不会增加秩r相干性。

Result: 算法在稠密设置下达到与最优非私有算法相同的单峰PCA Wishart模型保证，显著优于现有私有算法。相干性在高斯扰动下保持不变。

Conclusion: 该简单算法在多个场景下优于现有方法，相干性是差分隐私分析中的有用概念，在图形问题中也有应用潜力。

Abstract: We revisit the task of computing the span of the top $r$ singular vectors
$u_1, \ldots, u_r$ of a matrix under differential privacy. We show that a
simple and efficient algorithm -- based on singular value decomposition and
standard perturbation mechanisms -- returns a private rank-$r$ approximation
whose error depends only on the \emph{rank-$r$ coherence} of $u_1, \ldots, u_r$
and the spectral gap $\sigma_r - \sigma_{r+1}$. This resolves a question posed
by Hardt and Roth~\cite{hardt2013beyond}. Our estimator outperforms the state
of the art -- significantly so in some regimes. In particular, we show that in
the dense setting, it achieves the same guarantees for single-spike PCA in the
Wishart model as those attained by optimal non-private algorithms, whereas
prior private algorithms failed to do so.
  In addition, we prove that (rank-$r$) coherence does not increase under
Gaussian perturbations. This implies that any estimator based on the Gaussian
mechanism -- including ours -- preserves the coherence of the input. We
conjecture that similar behavior holds for other structured models, including
planted problems in graphs.
  We also explore applications of coherence to graph problems. In particular,
we present a differentially private algorithm for Max-Cut and other constraint
satisfaction problems under low coherence assumptions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LoRA已成为大型语言模型参数高效微调的流行技术，但在实际场景中同时加载多个适配器时，虽然单个适配器轻量，但聚合成本在规模上变得显著。

Method: 提出LoRAQuant方法：1）通过奇异值分解(SVD)对每个适配器进行重参数化；2）将最重要信息集中到特定行和列；3）对重要组件使用高精度量化，其余部分使用超低位宽量化。

Result: 在LLaMA 2-7B、LLaMA 2-13B和Mistral 7B模型上的数学推理、编码和摘要任务实验表明，LoRAQuant使用显著更低的比特数，但达到相当甚至更高的性能。

Conclusion: LoRAQuant能够有效降低多适配器场景下的存储和计算成本，同时保持模型性能，为大规模部署提供了实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has become a popular technique for
parameter-efficient fine-tuning of large language models (LLMs). In many
real-world scenarios, multiple adapters are loaded simultaneously to enable LLM
customization for personalized user experiences or to support a diverse range
of tasks. Although each adapter is lightweight in isolation, their aggregate
cost becomes substantial at scale. To address this, we propose LoRAQuant, a
mixed-precision post-training quantization method tailored to LoRA.
Specifically, LoRAQuant reparameterizes each adapter by singular value
decomposition (SVD) to concentrate the most important information into specific
rows and columns. This makes it possible to quantize the important components
to higher precision, while quantizing the rest to ultra-low bitwidth. We
conduct comprehensive experiments with LLaMA 2-7B, LLaMA 2-13B, and Mistral 7B
models on mathematical reasoning, coding, and summarization tasks. Results show
that our LoRAQuant uses significantly lower bits than other quantization
methods, but achieves comparable or even higher performance.

Abstract: Can regularization terms in the training of invertible neural networks lead
to known Bayesian point estimators in reconstruction? Invertible networks are
attractive for inverse problems due to their inherent stability and
interpretability. Recently, optimization strategies for invertible neural
networks that approximate either a reconstruction map or the forward operator
have been studied from a Bayesian perspective, but each has limitations. To
address this, we introduce and analyze two regularization terms for the network
training that, upon inversion of the network, recover properties of classical
Bayesian point estimators: while the first can be connected to the posterior
mean, the second resembles the MAP estimator. Our theoretical analysis
characterizes how each loss shapes both the learned forward operator and its
inverse reconstruction map. Numerical experiments support our findings and
demonstrate how these loss-term regularizers introduce data-dependence in a
stable and interpretable way.

Abstract: Learning to defer uncertain predictions to costly experts offers a powerful
strategy for improving the accuracy and efficiency of machine learning systems.
However, standard training procedures for deferral algorithms typically require
querying all experts for every training instance, an approach that becomes
prohibitively expensive when expert queries incur significant computational or
resource costs. This undermines the core goal of deferral: to limit unnecessary
expert usage. To overcome this challenge, we introduce the budgeted deferral
framework, which aims to train effective deferral algorithms while minimizing
expert query costs during training. We propose new algorithms for both
two-stage and single-stage multiple-expert deferral settings that selectively
query only a subset of experts per training example. While inspired by active
learning, our setting is fundamentally different: labels are already known, and
the core challenge is to decide which experts to query in order to balance cost
and predictive performance. We establish theoretical guarantees for both of our
algorithms, including generalization bounds and label complexity analyses.
Empirical results across several domains show that our algorithms substantially
reduce training costs without sacrificing prediction accuracy, demonstrating
the practical value of our budget-aware deferral algorithms.

Motivation: 当前机器学习遗忘算法的实证比较通常从同一训练模型开始多次运行算法，但这种方法可能无法准确反映算法性能，因为训练种子的选择会影响结果。

Method: 通过分析不同训练种子下机器学习遗忘算法的表现，评估其对随机数种子的敏感性。

Conclusion: 建议在实证比较机器学习遗忘算法时，应考虑不同模型训练种子带来的变异性，以获得更准确和代表性的评估结果。

Abstract: Machine unlearning (MU) aims to remove the influence of certain data points
from a trained model without costly retraining. Most practical MU algorithms
are only approximate and their performance can only be assessed empirically.
Care must therefore be taken to make empirical comparisons as representative as
possible. A common practice is to run the MU algorithm multiple times
independently starting from the same trained model. In this work, we
demonstrate that this practice can give highly non-representative results
because -- even for the same architecture and same dataset -- some MU methods
can be highly sensitive to the choice of random number seed used for model
training. We therefore recommend that empirical
comphttps://info.arxiv.org/help/prep#commentsarisons of MU algorithms should
also reflect the variability across different model training seeds.

Motivation: 现有的差分隐私协方差矩阵发布方法在不同数据集规模下存在误差界限不够优化的问题，特别是在小数据集情况下需要改进误差保证。

Method: 使用简单的扰动机制，对于小数据集将输出投影到适当半径的核范数球上，以优化误差界限。

Conclusion: 该机制是第一个在纯差分隐私下达到谱范数最优误差的协方差估计器，在不同数据集规模下都提供了改进的误差保证。

Abstract: We present a simple perturbation mechanism for the release of $d$-dimensional
covariance matrices $\Sigma$ under pure differential privacy. For large
datasets with at least $n\geq d^2/\varepsilon$ elements, our mechanism recovers
the provably optimal Frobenius norm error guarantees of
\cite{nikolov2023private}, while simultaneously achieving best known error for
all other $p$-Schatten norms, with $p\in [1,\infty]$. Our error is
information-theoretically optimal for all $p\ge 2$, in particular, our
mechanism is the first purely private covariance estimator that achieves
optimal error in spectral norm.
  For small datasets $n< d^2/\varepsilon$, we further show that by projecting
the output onto the nuclear norm ball of appropriate radius, our algorithm
achieves the optimal Frobenius norm error $O(\sqrt{d\;\text{Tr}(\Sigma) /n})$,
improving over the known bounds of $O(\sqrt{d/n})$ of \cite{nikolov2023private}
and ${O}\big(d^{3/4}\sqrt{\text{Tr}(\Sigma)/n}\big)$ of

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是理解Transformer模型如何存储参数化记忆，特别是为什么模型会形成几何结构来编码全局实体关系，而不仅仅是存储训练时指定的局部共现关系。

Method: 通过分析Transformer推理的实例，并与Node2Vec建立联系，研究几何结构形成的机制，特别是光谱偏差在其中的作用。

Result: 发现Transformer模型确实会自发形成几何结构来存储原子事实，这种几何结构将复杂的推理任务简化为易于学习的几何任务。几何结构的形成源于自然出现的光谱偏差，而非典型的架构或优化压力。

Conclusion: 参数化记忆的几何视图鼓励研究者重新审视知识获取、容量、发现和遗忘等领域的默认直觉，并指出了使Transformer记忆更具几何性的改进空间。

Abstract: In sequence modeling, the parametric memory of atomic facts has been
predominantly abstracted as a brute-force lookup of co-occurrences between
entities. We contrast this associative view against a geometric view of how
memory is stored. We begin by isolating a clean and analyzable instance of
Transformer reasoning that is incompatible with memory as strictly a storage of
the local co-occurrences specified during training. Instead, the model must
have somehow synthesized its own geometry of atomic facts, encoding global
relationships between all entities, including non-co-occurring ones. This in
turn has simplified a hard reasoning task involving an $\ell$-fold composition
into an easy-to-learn 1-step geometric task.
  From this phenomenon, we extract fundamental aspects of neural embedding
geometries that are hard to explain. We argue that the rise of such a geometry,
despite optimizing over mere local associations, cannot be straightforwardly
attributed to typical architectural or optimizational pressures.
Counterintuitively, an elegant geometry is learned even when it is not more
succinct than a brute-force lookup of associations.
  Then, by analyzing a connection to Node2Vec, we demonstrate how the geometry
stems from a spectral bias that -- in contrast to prevailing theories -- indeed
arises naturally despite the lack of various pressures. This analysis also
points to practitioners a visible headroom to make Transformer memory more
strongly geometric. We hope the geometric view of parametric memory encourages
revisiting the default intuitions that guide researchers in areas like
knowledge acquisition, capacity, discovery and unlearning.

Motivation: 现有量化方法在激活量化低于8位时精度显著下降，需要新的策略来维持低比特量化下的模型准确性。

Method: 使用序列维度的线性变换利用语言和视觉数据的强局部相关性，并在中间激活中保持少量token的高精度。

Result: 在LVM和LLM架构上评估，STaMP显著改善了低比特宽度激活量化，并与现有量化方法互补。

Conclusion: STaMP量化策略能有效维持模型精度，同时降低平均激活比特宽度，是量化方法的重要补充。

Abstract: Quantization is the key method for reducing inference latency, power and
memory footprint of generative AI models. However, accuracy often degrades
sharply when activations are quantized below eight bits. Recent work suggests
that invertible linear transformations (e.g. rotations) can aid quantization,
by reparameterizing feature channels and weights. In this paper, we propose
\textit{Sequence Transformation and Mixed Precision} (STaMP) quantization, a
novel strategy that applies linear transformations along the \textit{sequence}
dimension to exploit the strong local correlation in language and visual data.
By keeping a small number of tokens in each intermediate activation at higher
precision, we can maintain model accuracy at lower (average) activations
bit-widths. We evaluate STaMP on recent LVM and LLM architectures,
demonstrating that it significantly improves low bit width activation
quantization and complements established activation and weight quantization
methods including recent feature transformations.

Conclusion: 提出的采样方法能有效平衡计算效率与影响函数估计精度，为黑盒模型训练数据影响分析提供了可行方案。

Abstract: How can we explain the influence of training data on black-box models?
Influence functions (IFs) offer a post-hoc solution by utilizing gradients and
Hessians. However, computing the Hessian for an entire dataset is
resource-intensive, necessitating a feasible alternative. A common approach
involves randomly sampling a small subset of the training data, but this method
often results in highly inconsistent IF estimates due to the high variance in
sample configurations. To address this, we propose two advanced sampling
techniques based on features and logits. These samplers select a small yet
representative subset of the entire dataset by considering the stochastic
distribution of features or logits, thereby enhancing the accuracy of IF
estimations. We validate our approach through class removal experiments, a
typical application of IFs, using the F1-score to measure how effectively the
model forgets the removed class while maintaining inference consistency on the
remaining classes. Our method reduces computation time by 30.1% and memory
usage by 42.2%, or improves the F1-score by 2.5% compared to the baseline.

Conclusion: 学习预测可能是构建通用时序基础模型的有效途径，任务特定预训练可能不是必要的。

Abstract: Recent research on time series foundation models has primarily focused on
forecasting, leaving it unclear how generalizable their learned representations
are. In this study, we examine whether frozen pre-trained forecasting models
can provide effective representations for classification. To this end, we
compare different representation extraction strategies and introduce two
model-agnostic embedding augmentations. Our experiments show that the best
forecasting models achieve classification accuracy that matches or even
surpasses that of state-of-the-art models pre-trained specifically for
classification. Moreover, we observe a positive correlation between forecasting
and classification performance. These findings challenge the assumption that
task-specific pre-training is necessary, and suggest that learning to forecast
may provide a powerful route toward constructing general-purpose time series
foundation models.

Motivation: 当前世界模型在长期预测中表现脆弱，主要原因是表示质量不足：高维外部感知输入和损失/纠缠的潜在表示使动态学习变得困难。研究是否仅通过改进表示学习就能显著提升世界模型性能。

Method: 提出GRWM方法，在潜在表示空间中施加几何正则化，确保连续观测点在潜在空间中保持邻近关系。该方法即插即用，只需最小架构修改，与多种潜在生成主干兼容。

Result: 在确定性3D环境和长期预测任务中，GRWM显著提高了rollout保真度和稳定性。分析表明其优势源于学习到具有更优几何结构的潜在流形。

Conclusion: 改进表示学习是构建鲁棒世界模型的直接有效途径，可在不扩大动态模块的情况下实现可靠的长期预测。

Abstract: A world model is an internal model that simulates how the world evolves.
Given past observations and actions, it predicts the future of both the
embodied agent and its environment. Accurate world models are essential for
enabling agents to think, plan, and reason effectively in complex, dynamic
settings. Despite rapid progress, current world models remain brittle and
degrade over long horizons. We argue that a central cause is representation
quality: exteroceptive inputs (e.g., images) are high-dimensional, and lossy or
entangled latents make dynamics learning unnecessarily hard. We therefore ask
whether improving representation learning alone can substantially improve
world-model performance. In this work, we take a step toward building a truly
accurate world model by addressing a fundamental yet open problem: constructing
a model that can fully clone and overfit to a deterministic 3D world. We
propose Geometrically-Regularized World Models (GRWM), which enforces that
consecutive points along a natural sensory trajectory remain close in latent
representation space. This approach yields significantly improved latent
representations that align closely with the true topology of the environment.
GRWM is plug-and-play, requires only minimal architectural modification, scales
with trajectory length, and is compatible with diverse latent generative
backbones. Across deterministic 3D settings and long-horizon prediction tasks,
GRWM significantly increases rollout fidelity and stability. Analyses show that
its benefits stem from learning a latent manifold with superior geometric
structure. These findings support a clear takeaway: improving representation
learning is a direct and useful path to robust world models, delivering
reliable long-horizon predictions without enlarging the dynamics module.

Result: 使用FP16能带来更稳定的优化、更快的收敛速度，并在不同任务、算法和框架中都表现出更强的性能。

Conclusion: FP16在RL微调中比BF16更优，建议重新考虑精度权衡问题。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) fine-tuning of large language models (LLMs) often
suffers from instability due to the numerical mismatch between the training and
inference policies. While prior work has attempted to mitigate this issue
through algorithmic corrections or engineering alignments, we show that its
root cause lies in the floating point precision itself. The widely adopted
BF16, despite its large dynamic range, introduces large rounding errors that
breaks the consistency between training and inference. In this work, we
demonstrate that simply reverting to \textbf{FP16} effectively eliminates this
mismatch. The change is simple, fully supported by modern frameworks with only
a few lines of code change, and requires no modification to the model
architecture or learning algorithm. Our results suggest that using FP16
uniformly yields more stable optimization, faster convergence, and stronger
performance across diverse tasks, algorithms and frameworks. We hope these
findings motivate a broader reconsideration of precision trade-offs in RL
fine-tuning.

Conclusion: Transformer能够学习复杂的伪随机生成模式，揭示了模型自发形成比特旋转不变聚类的能力，为理解神经网络在序列预测任务中的表示学习提供了新见解。

Abstract: We study the ability of Transformer models to learn sequences generated by
Permuted Congruential Generators (PCGs), a widely used family of pseudo-random
number generators (PRNGs). PCGs introduce substantial additional difficulty
over linear congruential generators (LCGs) by applying a series of bit-wise
shifts, XORs, rotations and truncations to the hidden state. We show that
Transformers can nevertheless successfully perform in-context prediction on
unseen sequences from diverse PCG variants, in tasks that are beyond published
classical attacks. In our experiments we scale moduli up to $2^{22}$ using up
to $50$ million model parameters and datasets with up to $5$ billion tokens.
Surprisingly, we find even when the output is truncated to a single bit, it can
be reliably predicted by the model. When multiple distinct PRNGs are presented
together during training, the model can jointly learn them, identifying
structures from different permutations. We demonstrate a scaling law with
modulus $m$: the number of in-context sequence elements required for
near-perfect prediction grows as $\sqrt{m}$. For larger moduli, optimization
enters extended stagnation phases; in our experiments, learning moduli $m \geq
2^{20}$ requires incorporating training data from smaller moduli, demonstrating
a critical necessity for curriculum learning. Finally, we analyze embedding
layers and uncover a novel clustering phenomenon: the model spontaneously
groups the integer inputs into bitwise rotationally-invariant clusters,
revealing how representations can transfer from smaller to larger moduli.

Motivation: 解决MoE架构推理中由于频繁参数传输导致的显著延迟问题，以及现有跨层预测策略在不同硬件平台和工作负载下缺乏适应性的局限。

Method: 结合自适应专家预取和缓存感知路由，利用运行时统计信息（传输带宽、参数维度、模型反馈信号）动态调整预测范围，并采用混合跨层预测方案融合预门控信息和中间计算状态来预测未来专家需求。

Conclusion: ExpertFlow通过自适应预取决策和与实际使用行为的对齐，有效减少了缓存未命中并消除了专家交换引入的延迟，为内存受限环境下的MoE推理提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: The expansion of large language models is increasingly limited by the
constrained memory capacity of modern GPUs. To mitigate this,
Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures activate only a small portion of
parameters during inference, significantly lowering both memory demand and
computational overhead. However, conventional MoE inference approaches, which
select active experts independently at each layer, often introduce considerable
latency because of frequent parameter transfers between host and GPU memory. In
addition, current cross-layer prediction strategies, which are typically based
on fixed steps, lack adaptability across different hardware platforms and
workloads, thereby reducing their robustness and effectiveness.
  To address these challenges, we present ExpertFlow, a runtime system for MoE
inference that combines adaptive expert prefetching and cache-aware routing.
ExpertFlow continuously adjusts its prediction horizon for expert activation by
leveraging runtime statistics such as transfer bandwidth, parameter
dimensionality, and model feedback signals. Furthermore, it incorporates a
hybrid cross-layer prediction scheme that fuses pregating information with
intermediate computational states to anticipate future expert needs. By
adaptively refining prefetching decisions and aligning them with actual usage
behavior, ExpertFlow effectively decreases cache misses and removes latency
caused by expert swap-ins. Our evaluation demonstrates that ExpertFlow reduces
model stall time to less than 0.1% of the baseline, highlighting its capability
to optimize MoE inference under stringent memory constraints.
