These\ndatasets may be unevenly discretized from one realization to another, with the\ngrid resolution varying across samples. In this study, we introduce a\nphysics-informed operator learning approach by extending the Resolution\nIndependent Neural Operator (RINO) framework to a fully data-free setup,\naddressing both challenges simultaneously. Here, the arbitrarily (but\nsufficiently finely) discretized input functions are projected onto a latent\nembedding space (i.e., a vector space of finite dimensions), using pre-trained\nbasis functions. The operator associated with the underlying partial\ndifferential equations (PDEs) is then approximated by a simple multi-layer\nperceptron (MLP), which takes as input a latent code along with spatiotemporal\ncoordinates to produce the solution in the physical space. The PDEs are\nenforced via a finite difference solver in the physical space.

Causal discovery in time series is\nhindered by the combinatorial complexity of identifying true causal\nrelationships, especially as the number of variables and time points grow. A\ncommon approach to simplify the task is the so-called ordering-based methods.\nTraditional ordering methods inherently limit the representational capacity of\nthe resulting model. In this work, we fix this issue by leveraging multiple\nvalid causal orderings, instead of a single one as standard practice. We\npropose DOTS (Diffusion Ordered Temporal Structure), using diffusion-based\ncausal discovery for temporal data. By integrating multiple orderings, DOTS\neffectively recovers the transitive closure of the underlying directed acyclic\ngraph, mitigating spurious artifacts inherent in single-ordering approaches. We\nformalise the problem under standard assumptions such as stationarity and the\nadditive noise model, and leverage score matching with diffusion processes to\nenable efficient Hessian estimation.

We observe\nthat in modern large-modelinference, parameters and activations routinely move\nbackand forth from HBM/DRAM, injecting large, bursty flows into theinterposer.\nThese memory-driven transfers inflate tail latency andviolate Service Level\nAgreements (SLAs) across k-ary n-cube base-line NoI topologies. To address this\ngap we introduce an InterferenceScore (IS) that quantifies worst-case slowdown\nunder contention.We then formulate NoI synthesis as a multi-objective\noptimization(MOO) problem. We develop PARL (Partition-Aware\nReinforcementLearner), a topology generator that balances throughput,\nlatency,and power. PARL-generated topologies reduce contention at the memory\ncut, meet SLAs, and cut worst-case slowdown to 1.2 times while maintaining\ncompetitive mean throughput relative to link-rich meshes. Overall, this\nreframes NoI design for heterogeneouschiplet accelerators with workload-aware\nobjectives."}

Two unique challenges stand out: (1) efficiently and accurately\nforecasting time series or detecting anomalies in large volumes automatically;\nand (2) ensuring interpretability of results to effectively incorporate\nbusiness insights. We present ARIMA_PLUS, a novel framework to overcome these\ntwo challenges by a unique combination of (a) accurate and interpretable time\nseries models and (b) scalable and fully managed system infrastructure. The\nmodel has a sequential and modular structure to handle different components of\nthe time series, including holiday effects, seasonality, trend, and anomalies,\nwhich enables high interpretability of the results. Novel enhancements are made\nto each module, and a unified framework is established to address both\nforecasting and anomaly detection tasks simultaneously. In terms of accuracy,\nits comprehensive benchmark on the 42 public datasets in the Monash forecasting\nrepository shows superior performance over not only well-established\nstatistical alternatives (such as ETS, ARIMA, TBATS, Prophet) but also newer\nneural network models (such as DeepAR, N-BEATS, PatchTST, TimeMixer). In terms\nof infrastructure, it is directly built into the query engine of BigQuery in\nGoogle Cloud. It uses a simple SQL interface and automates tedious\ntechnicalities such as data cleaning and model selection. It automatically\nscales with managed cloud computational and storage resources, making it\npossible to forecast 100 million time series using only 1.5 hours with a\nthroughput of more than 18000 time series per second. In terms of\ninterpretability, we present several case studies to demonstrate time series\ninsights it generates and customizability it offers."}
