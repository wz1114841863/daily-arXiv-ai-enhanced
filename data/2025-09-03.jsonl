A data center server can\nrun many multiserver jobs in parallel, as long as it has sufficient resources\nto meet their demands. However, multiserver jobs are generally stateful,\nmeaning that job preemptions incur significant overhead from saving and\nreloading the state associated with running jobs. Hence, most systems try to\navoid these costly job preemptions altogether. Given these constraints, a\nscheduling policy must determine what set of jobs to run in parallel at each\nmoment in time to minimize the mean response time across a stream of arriving\njobs. Unfortunately, simple non-preemptive policies such as FCFS may leave many\ncores idle, resulting in high mean response times or even system instability.\nOur goal is to design and analyze non-preemptive scheduling policies for\nmultiserver jobs that maintain high system utilization to achieve low mean\nresponse time.\n  One well-known non-preemptive policy, Most Servers First (MSF), prioritizes\njobs with higher core requirements and achieves high resource utilization.\nHowever, MSF causes extreme variability in job waiting times, and can perform\nsignificantly worse than FCFS in practice. To address this, we propose and\nanalyze a class of scheduling policies called MSF-Quick Swap (MSFQ) that\nperforms well. MSFQ reduces the variability of job waiting times by\nperiodically granting priority to other jobs in the system. We provide both\nstability results and an analysis of mean response time under MSFQ to prove\nthat our policy dramatically outperforms MSF in the case where jobs request one\ncore or all the cores. In more complex cases, we evaluate MSFQ in simulation.\nWe show that, with some additional optimization, variants of the MSFQ policy\ncan greatly outperform MSF and FCFS on real-world multiserver job workloads."}

However, the general case with arbitrary\nconcave speedup functions -- which more accurately capture real-world workloads\n-- has remained open.\n  In this paper, we solve this open problem by developing optimal scheduling\nalgorithms for parallel jobs under general concave speedup functions. We first\ndiscover a fundamental and broadly-applicable rule for optimal parallel\nscheduling, namely the Consistent Derivative Ratio (CDR) Rule, which states\nthat the ratio of the derivatives of the speedup functions across active jobs\nremains constant over time. To efficiently compute the optimal allocations that\nsatisfy the CDR Rule, we propose the General Water-Filling (GWF) method, a more\ngeneral version of classical water-filling in wireless communications.\nCombining these insights, we design the SmartFill Algorithm to solve the\ngeneral scheduling problem.

This paper explores a new direction for\ndynamic adaptation by investigating a novel class of post-hoc, diagnostic\nsignals. We propose Dynamic Speculative Decoding Engine (DSDE), a training-free\nframework built on two primary components: (1) a predictive signal based on the\nvariance of the Kullback-Leibler (KLD) divergence, which diagnoses the\ngeneration's regional stability, and (2) an adaptive speculation length cap to\nmitigate the straggler problem in per-sequence decoding. Experiments\ndemonstrate the potential of using KLD-based stability signals for dynamic\nadaptation. An algorithm guided by these signals achieves end-to-end latency\ncompetitive with leading baselines and exhibits superior robustness across\ndiverse workloads. This robustness is particularly valuable in challenging\nlow-acceptance-rate regimes, where the proposed signal maintains its diagnostic\nutility.

We anticipate that adversaries may\nexploit the intense vertical and lateral adjacency to design and develop\nthermal performance degradation attacks on the memory banks that host\ndata/instructions from victim applications. In such attacks, the adversary\nmanages to inject short and intense heat pulses from vertically and/or\nlaterally adjacent memory banks, creating a convergent thermal wave that\nmaximizes impact and delays the victim application from accessing its\ndata/instructions. As the attacking application does not access any\nout-of-range memory locations, it can bypass both design-time security tests\nand the operating system's memory management policies.

GS-TG addresses a critical\ntrade-off issue in 3D-GS rendering: increasing the tile size effectively\nreduces redundant sorting operations, but it concurrently increases unnecessary\nrasterization computations.

We extract\nQuery-projection, down-projection and other weight matrices from the\nself-attention layers and MLP layers, calculate the singular values of the\nmatrices using singular value decomposition, and organize a certain number of\nsingular values into matrices according to projection's type. By analyzing the\nprobability distribution of the cosine distances between these matrices, it is\nfound that the cosine distances values between them have distinct power-law\ndistribution characteristics. Secondly, based on the results of distance\ncalculations and analysis across different layers of model, a qualitative\nmethod is proposed to describe the distribution characteristics of different\nmodels. Next, to construct weights that align with the distribution\ncharacteristics, a data generator is designed using a combination of Gaussian\nprocess and Pareto distribution functions. The generator is used to simulate\nthe generation of data that aligns with specific distribution characteristics.\nFinally, based on the aforementioned distribution characteristics and data\ngeneration method, the weights in LoRA initialization are reshaped for\ntraining.

Then it formulates QAT as a\nco-optimization problem that simultaneously minimizes the task loss for\nprediction and the discretization error for quantization, providing a unified\nand generalizable framework. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet\nacross various architectures (e.g., ResNet, VGG) demonstrate that PEGE\nconsistently outperforms existing backpropagation methods and enables\nlow-precision models to match or even outperform the accuracy of their\nfull-precision counterparts."}

This work\nintroduces an orthogonal initialization specifically optimized for ReLU by\nsolving an optimization problem on the Stiefel manifold, thereby preserving\nscale and calibrating the pre-activation statistics from the outset. A family\nof closed-form solutions and an efficient sampling scheme are derived.\nTheoretical analysis at initialization shows that prevention of the dying ReLU\nproblem, slower decay of activation variance, and mitigation of gradient\nvanishing, which together stabilize signal and gradient flow in deep\narchitectures. Empirically, across MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, multiple tabular\ndatasets, few-shot settings, and ReLU-family activations, our method\noutperforms previous initializations and enables stable training in deep\nnetworks."}

However, the sparse and biased subgraphs often trigger rapid\noverfitting, causing the estimated client similarity matrix to stagnate or even\ncollapse. As a result, aggregation loses effectiveness as clients reinforce\ntheir own biases instead of exploiting diverse knowledge otherwise available.\nTo this end, we propose a novel personalized subgraph FL framework called\nCurriculum guided personalized sUbgraph Federated Learning (CUFL).

To address these limitations,\nthis paper introduces Assessing and Mitigating Copyright Risks (AMCR), a\ncomprehensive framework which i) builds upon prompt-based strategies by\nsystematically restructuring risky prompts into safe and non-sensitive forms,\nii) detects partial infringements through attention-based similarity analysis,\nand iii) adaptively mitigates risks during generation to reduce copyright\nviolations without compromising image quality.

These refined annotations are used\nto retrain motion-to-text models to produce captions with low-level details.\nSecond, we introduce a pioneering retrieval-based mechanism.

In this paper, we show that agents backed by weaker models that\nimprove via reinforcement learning (RL) can outperform agents backed by much\nlarger, but static models. We identify two major challenges with RL in this\nsetting. First, actions can take a variable amount of time (e.g., executing\ncode for different solutions), which leads to asynchronous policy gradient\nupdates that favor faster but suboptimal solutions. To tackle variable-duration\nactions, we propose duration- aware gradient updates in a distributed\nasynchronous RL framework to amplify high-cost but high-reward actions. Second,\nusing only test split performance as a reward provides limited feedback. A\nprogram that is nearly correct is treated the same as one that fails entirely.\nTo address this, we propose environment instrumentation to offer partial\ncredit, distinguishing almost-correct programs from those that fail early\n(e.g., during data loading). Environment instrumentation uses a separate static\nlanguage model to insert print statement to an existing program to log the\nagent's experimental progress, from which partial credit can be extracted as\nreward signals for learning. Our experimental results on MLEBench suggest that\nperforming gradient updates on a much smaller model (Qwen2.5-3B) trained with\nRL outperforms prompting a much larger model (Claude-3.5-Sonnet) with agent\nscaffolds, by an average of 22% across 12 Kaggle tasks."}

Recently, this\nduality between semantic and episodic memories has been challenged by\npredictive coding, a biologically plausible neural network model of the\nneocortex which was shown to have hippocampus-like abilities on\nauto-associative memory tasks. These results raise the question of the episodic\ncapabilities of the neocortex and their relation to semantic memory.

However, extending TIR to multi-turn scenarios\nusing Reinforcement Learning (RL) is often hindered by training instability and\nperformance collapse. We identify that such instability is primarily caused by\na distributional drift from external tool feedback, leading to the generation\nof low-probability tokens. This issue compounds over successive turns, causing\ncatastrophic gradient norm explosions that derail the training process. To\naddress this challenge, we introduce SimpleTIR , a plug-and-play algorithm that\nstabilizes multi-turn TIR training. Its core strategy is to identify and filter\nout trajectories containing void turns, i.e., turns that yield neither a code\nblock nor a final answer. By removing these problematic trajectories from the\npolicy update, SimpleTIR effectively blocks the harmful, high-magnitude\ngradients, thus stabilizing the learning dynamics. Extensive experiments show\nthat SimpleTIR achieves state-of-the-art performance on challenging math\nreasoning benchmarks, notably elevating the AIME24 score from a text-only\nbaseline of 22.1 to 50.5 when starting from the Qwen2.5-7B base model.\nFurthermore, by avoiding the constraints of supervised fine-tuning, SimpleTIR\nencourages the model to discover diverse and sophisticated reasoning patterns,\nsuch as self-correction and cross-validation."}

Traditional data-driven approaches, such as\nconvolutional networks and sequence-based models, ignore topological\ninformation about the region. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) propagate\ninformation exactly along the river network, which is ideal for learning\nhydrological routing. However, state-of-the-art GNN-based flood prediction\nmodels collapse pixels to coarse catchment polygons as the cost of training\nexplodes with graph size and higher resolution. Furthermore, most existing\nmethods treat spatial and temporal dependencies separately, either applying\nGNNs solely on spatial graphs or transformers purely on temporal sequences,\nthus failing to simultaneously capture spatiotemporal interactions critical for\naccurate flood prediction. We introduce a heterogenous basin graph where every\nland and river pixel is a node connected by physical hydrological flow\ndirections and inter-catchment relationships.
