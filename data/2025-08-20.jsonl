The Node\nAggregation Layer captures topological structures to generate static\nrepresentation for users and items, while the Self Attentive Layer dynamically\nupdates embeddings over time.

However, incorporating natural\nlanguage-based external events to improve non-stationary forecasting remains\nlargely unexplored, as most approaches still rely on a single modality,\nresulting in limited contextual knowledge and model underperformance. Enabling\nfine-grained multimodal interactions between temporal and textual data is\nchallenged by three fundamental issues: (1) the difficulty of fine-grained\nsynchronization between time-varying discrete textual events and continuous\ntime series; (2) the inherent temporal uncertainty introduced by textual\nsemantics; and (3) the misalignment between textual event embeddings and\nmulti-resolution temporal patterns. In this work, we address these challenges\nby introducing event-aware non-stationary time series forecasting (EventTSF),\nan autoregressive generation framework that integrates historical time series\nwith textual events to make subsequent forecasts. Specifically, EventTSF uses\nautoregressive diffusion with flow matching at each step to capture nuanced\ntemporal-event interactions. To handle event-induced uncertainty, flow matching\ntimesteps are adaptively controlled according to event semantic signals. The\nunderlying denoiser employs a multimodal U-shaped diffusion transformer that\nefficiently fuses temporal and textual modalities across different resolutions.\nExtensive experiments on 8 synthetic and real-world datasets show that EventTSF\noutperforms 12 baselines across diverse event-aware non-stationary time series\nforecasting scenarios, achieving substantial improvements of 10.7% higher\nforecasting accuracy and $1.13\\times$ faster training efficiency."}

However, most existing optimizers struggle to perform\neffectively at such a large batch size. As batch size increases, gradient noise\ndecreases due to averaging over many samples, limiting the ability of\nfirst-order methods to escape sharp or suboptimal minima and reach the global\nminimum. Meanwhile, second-order methods like the natural gradient with\nKronecker-Factored Approximate Curvature (KFAC) often require excessively high\ndamping to remain stable at large batch sizes. This high damping effectively\nwashes out the curvature information that gives these methods their advantage,\nreducing their performance to that of simple gradient descent. In this paper,\nwe introduce Fisher-Orthogonal Projection (FOP), a novel technique that\nrestores the effectiveness of the second-order method at very large batch\nsizes, enabling scalable training with improved generalization and faster\nconvergence.

Among\nthem, Diffusion Q-Learning (DQL) stands out as a leading method for its\nconsistently strong performance. Nevertheless, DQL remains limited in practice\ndue to its reliance on multi-step denoising for action generation during both\ntraining and inference. Although one-step denoising is desirable, simply\napplying it to DQL leads to a drastic performance drop. In this work, we\nrevisit DQL and identify its core limitations. We then propose One-Step Flow\nQ-Learning (OFQL), a novel framework that enables efficient one-step action\ngeneration during both training and inference, without requiring auxiliary\nmodels, distillation, or multi-phase training. Specifically, OFQL reformulates\nDQL within the sample-efficient Flow Matching (FM) framework. While\nconventional FM induces curved generative trajectories that impede one-step\ngeneration, OFQL instead learns an average velocity field that facilitates\ndirect, accurate action generation. Collectively, OFQL eliminates the need for\nmulti-step sampling and recursive gradient updates in DQL, resulting in faster\nand more robust training and inference. Extensive experiments on the D4RL\nbenchmark demonstrate that OFQL outperforms DQL and other diffusion-based\nbaselines, while substantially reducing both training and inference time\ncompared to DQL."}
