This growth comes at the\ncost of increased electricity consumption, which directly correlates to CO2\nemissions, the main driver of climate change. As such, researching ways to\nreduce cloud computing emissions is more relevant than ever. However, although\ncloud providers are reportedly already working near optimal power efficiency,\nthey fail in providing precise sustainability reporting. This calls for further\nimprovements on the cloud computing consumer's side. To this end, in this paper\nwe propose a user-centric, Kubernetes-based architecture for green cloud\ncomputing. We implement a carbon intensity forecaster and we use it to schedule\nworkloads based on the availability of green energy, exploiting both regional\nand temporal variations to minimize emissions. We evaluate our system using\nreal-world traces of cloud workloads execution comparing the achieved carbon\nemission savings against a baseline round-robin scheduler. Our findings\nindicate that our system can achieve up to a 13% reduction in emissions in a\nstrict scenario with heavy limitations on the available resources."}

One\nsuch candidate for this technology are nanopore devices. These devices work by\nmeasuring a current signal that arises when a protein or peptide enters a\nnanometer-length-scale pore. Should this current be uniquely related to the\nstructure of the peptide and its interactions with the pore, the signals can be\nused to perform identification. While such a method would allow for real time\nidentification of peptides and proteins in a clinical setting, to date, the\ncomplexities of these signals limit their accuracy. In this work, we tackle the\nissue of classification by converting the current signals into scaleogram\nimages via wavelet transforms, capturing amplitude, frequency, and time\ninformation in a modality well-suited to machine learning algorithms. When\ntested on 42 peptides, our method achieved a classification accuracy of\n~$81\\,\\%$, setting a new state-of-the-art in the field and taking a step toward\npractical peptide/protein diagnostics at the point of care. In addition, we\ndemonstrate model transfer techniques that will be critical when deploying\nthese models into real hardware, paving the way to a new method for real-time\ndisease diagnosis."}

Glaucoma, a leading cause of irreversible blindness\ndriven by elevated intraocular pressure (IOP), provides a stark example. The\nprimary determinant of IOP, a tissue property called trabecular meshwork\npermeability, cannot be measured in vivo, forcing clinicians to depend on\nindirect surrogates. This clinical challenge is compounded by a broader\ncomputational one: developing predictive models for such ill-posed inverse\nproblems is hindered by a lack of ground-truth data and prohibitive cost of\nlarge-scale, high-fidelity simulations. We address both challenges with an\nend-to-end framework to noninvasively estimate unmeasurable variables from\nsparse, routine data. Our approach combines a multi-stage artificial\nintelligence architecture to functionally separate the problem; a novel data\ngeneration strategy we term PCDS that obviates the need for hundreds of\nthousands of costly simulations, reducing the effective computational time from\nyears to hours; and a Bayesian engine to quantify predictive uncertainty.
