This method provides a precise analysis\nthat complements existing techniques, particularly in quantifying unused\nresource slack. Specifically, we classify programs based on whether they are\nlimited by computation, data access bandwidth, or latency by injecting\nadditional noise instructions that target specific bottleneck sources. Our\napproach is built on the LLVM compiler toolchain, ensuring easy portability\nacross different architectures and microarchitectures which constitutes an\nimprovement over many state-of-the-art tools. We validate our framework on a\nrange of hardware benchmarks and kernels, including a detailedstudy of a\nsparse-matrix--vector product (SPMXV) kernel, where we successfully detect\ndistinct performance regimes.

The standard approach for encoding\noptimization problems on quantum processing units (QPUs) involves transforming\nthem into their Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO)\nrepresentation. However, encoding constraints of optimization problems,\nparticularly inequality constraints, into QUBO requires additional variables,\nwhich results in more qubits. Considering the limited availability of qubits in\nNISQ machines, existing encoding methods fail to scale due to their reliance on\nlarge numbers of qubits. We propose a generalized exponential penalty framework\nfor QUBO inequality constraints inspired by a class of exponential functions,\nwhich we call exponential penalization. This paper presents an encoding\nstrategy for inequality constraints in combinatorial optimization problems,\ninspired by a class of exponential functions, which we call exponential\npenalization. The initial idea of using exponential penalties for QUBO\nformulation was introduced by Montanez-Barrera et al. by applying a specific\nexponential function to reduce qubit requirements. In this work, we extend that\napproach by conducting a comprehensive study on a broader class of exponential\nfunctions, analyzing their theoretical properties and empirical performance.\nOur experimental results demonstrate that an exponential penalization achieves\n57%, 83% qubit number reduction for Bin Packing Problem (BPP) and Traveling\nSalesman Problem (TSP), respectively.

To overcome this threat, several unlearnable methods have been\nproposed, which generate unlearnable examples (UEs) by compromising the\ntraining availability of data. Clearly, due to unknown training purposes and\nthe powerful representation learning capabilities of existing models, these\ndata are expected to be unlearnable for models across multiple tasks, i.e.,\nthey will not help improve the model's performance. However, unexpectedly, we\nfind that on the multi-task dataset Taskonomy, UEs still perform well in tasks\nsuch as semantic segmentation, failing to exhibit cross-task unlearnability.\nThis phenomenon leads us to question: How far are we from attaining truly\nunlearnable examples? We attempt to answer this question from the perspective\nof model optimization. To this end, we observe the difference in the\nconvergence process between clean and poisoned models using a simple model\narchitecture. Subsequently, from the loss landscape we find that only a part of\nthe critical parameter optimization paths show significant differences,\nimplying a close relationship between the loss landscape and unlearnability.\nConsequently, we employ the loss landscape to explain the underlying reasons\nfor UEs and propose Sharpness-Aware Learnability (SAL) to quantify the\nunlearnability of parameters based on this explanation.

Critical to this\nsuccess are induction heads, attention circuits that enable copying tokens\nbased on their previous occurrences. In this work, we introduce a novel\nframework that showcases transformers' ability to dynamically handle causal\nstructures. Existing works rely on Markov Chains to study the formation of\ninduction heads, revealing how transformers capture causal dependencies and\nlearn transition probabilities in-context. However, they rely on a fixed causal\nstructure that fails to capture the complexity of natural languages, where the\nrelationship between tokens dynamically changes with context. To this end, our\nframework varies the causal structure through interleaved Markov chains with\ndifferent lags while keeping the transition probabilities fixed.

While Electrical Stimulation Mapping (ESM)\nremains the clinical gold standard, it is invasive and time-consuming. To\naddress this, we analyzed intracranial electrocorticographic (ECoG) data from\n16 participants performing speech tasks and developed machine learning models\nto directly predict if the brain region underneath each ECoG electrode is\ncritical. Ground truth labels indicating speech arrest were derived\nindependently from Electrical Stimulation Mapping (ESM) and used to train\nclassification models. Our framework integrates neural activity signals,\nanatomical region labels, and functional connectivity features to capture both\nlocal activity and network-level dynamics. We found that models combining\nregion and connectivity features matched the performance of the full feature\nset, and outperformed models using either type alone. To classify each\nelectrode, trial-level predictions were aggregated using an MLP applied to\nhistogram-encoded scores.
