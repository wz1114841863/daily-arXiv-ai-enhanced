We systematically classify the common\nerrors that arise during this formalization process.

However, their large feature sizes severely\nlimit integration density, imposing strict area and power constraints, thus\nprohibiting the realization of Machine Learning (ML) circuits, which can\nsignificantly enhance the capabilities of relevant near-sensor applications.\nSupport Vector Machines (SVMs) offer high accuracy in such applications at\nrelatively low computational complexity, satisfying FE technologies'\nconstraints. Existing SVM designs rely solely on linear or Radial Basis\nFunction (RBF) kernels, forcing a trade-off between hardware costs and\naccuracy. Linear kernels, implemented digitally, minimize overhead but\nsacrifice performance, while the more accurate RBF kernels are prohibitively\nlarge in digital, and their analog realization contains inherent functional\napproximation. In this work, we propose the first mixed-kernel and mixed-signal\nSVM design in FE, which unifies the advantages of both implementations and\nbalances the cost/accuracy trade-off. To that end, we introduce a\nco-optimization approach that trains our mixed-kernel SVMs and maps binary SVM\nclassifiers to the appropriate kernel (linear/RBF) and domain (digital/analog),\naiming to maximize accuracy whilst reducing the number of costly RBF\nclassifiers.

Many\nestablished approaches (e.g., extrapolation and quasi-probability cancellation)\nimpose substantial execution or calibration overheads, while existing\nlearning-based methods have difficulty scaling to large and deep circuits. In\nthis research, we introduce QAGT-MLP: an attention-based graph transformer\ntailored for small- and large-scale quantum error mitigation (QEM). QAGT-MLP\nencodes each quantum circuit as a graph whose nodes represent gate instances\nand whose edges capture qubit connectivity and causal adjacency. A dual-path\nattention module extracts features around measured qubits at two scales or\ncontexts: 1) graph-wide global structural context; and 2) fine-grained local\nlightcone context.

We also distinguish four settings that may appear when\npresenting a distributed task as $(\\I,\\Ou,\\Delta)$.

That\napproach scored approximately 7.8% on the public ARC AGI II evaluation set, but\nrequired a level of compute far in excess of what is allowed during the\ncompetition. This paper shows that, by starting from a tiny recursive model\nthat has been pre-trained on public ARC tasks, one can efficiently fine-tune on\ncompetition tasks within the allowed compute limits.

Although machine learning models\nhave advanced HAR, they are increasingly susceptible to data poisoning attacks\nthat compromise the data integrity and reliability of these systems.\nConventional approaches to defending against such attacks often require\nextensive task-specific training with large, labeled datasets, which limits\nadaptability in dynamic IoT environments. This work proposes a novel framework\nthat uses large language models (LLMs) to perform poisoning detection and\nsanitization in HAR systems, utilizing zero-shot, one-shot, and few-shot\nlearning paradigms. Our approach incorporates \\textit{role play} prompting,\nwhereby the LLM assumes the role of expert to contextualize and evaluate sensor\nanomalies, and \\textit{think step-by-step} reasoning, guiding the LLM to infer\npoisoning indicators in the raw sensor data and plausible clean alternatives.\nThese strategies minimize reliance on curation of extensive datasets and enable\nrobust, adaptable defense mechanisms in real-time. We perform an extensive\nevaluation of the framework, quantifying detection accuracy, sanitization\nquality, latency, and communication cost, thus demonstrating the practicality\nand effectiveness of LLMs in improving the security and reliability of wearable\nIoT systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4f7f\u7528\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u3001\u5355\u6837\u672c\u548c\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u89d2\u8272\u626e\u6f14\u548c\u9010\u6b65\u63a8\u7406\u6765\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u6e05\u7406\u53ef\u7a7f\u6234\u7269\u8054\u7f51\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u4eba\u7c7b\u6d3b\u52a8\u8bc6\u522b\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u6bd2\u653b\u51fb\u3002", "motivation": "\u53ef\u7a7f\u6234\u8bbe\u5907\u5728\u7269\u8054\u7f51\u4e2d\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5e94\u7528\u9700\u8981\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u4eba\u7c7b\u6d3b\u52a8\u8bc6\u522b\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u4f46\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u5bb9\u6613\u53d7\u5230\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u6bd2\u653b\u51fb\u3002\u4f20\u7edf\u9632\u5fa1\u65b9\u6cd5\u9700\u8981\u5927\u91cf\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u548c\u7279\u5b9a\u4efb\u52a1\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u9002\u5e94\u52a8\u6001\u7684\u7269\u8054\u7f51\u73af\u5883\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u4e2d\u6bd2\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u6e05\u7406\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u89d2\u8272\u626e\u6f14\u63d0\u793a\u8ba9LLM\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e13\u5bb6\u8bc4\u4f30\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u5f02\u5e38\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u9010\u6b65\u63a8\u7406\u6307\u5bfcLLM\u63a8\u65ad\u4e2d\u6bd2\u6307\u6807\u548c\u53ef\u80fd\u7684\u6e05\u6d01\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "result": "\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u68c0\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3001\u6e05\u7406\u8d28\u91cf\u3001\u5ef6\u8fdf\u548c\u901a\u4fe1\u6210\u672c\u65b9\u9762\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u5e7f\u6cdb\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86LLM\u5728\u63d0\u9ad8\u53ef\u7a7f\u6234\u7269\u8054\u7f51\u7cfb\u7edf\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u5bf9\u5927\u91cf\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5b9e\u65f6\u3001\u7a33\u5065\u4e14\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u5f3a\u7684\u9632\u5fa1\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86LLM\u5728\u4fdd\u62a4\u53ef\u7a7f\u6234\u7269\u8054\u7f51\u7cfb\u7edf\u5b89\u5168\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002"}}

We train and evaluate adaptive-sensorless models on the 3.48\nmillion data points -- the largest dataset of container sensor readings ever\nused in academic research -- and show that they produce consistent improvements\nover the baseline sensorless models. When evaluated on the holdout set of the\nsimulated data, they achieve average mean absolute errors (MAEs) of 2.24 $\\sim$\n2.31$^\\circ$C (vs 2.43$^\\circ$C by sensorless) for temperature and 5.72 $\\sim$\n7.09% for relative humidity (vs 7.99% by sensorless) and average root\nmean-squared errors (RMSEs) of 3.19 $\\sim$ 3.26$^\\circ$C for temperature (vs\n3.38$^\\circ$C by sensorless) and 7.70 $\\sim$ 9.12% for relative humidity (vs\n10.0% by sensorless).

For example,\nwe may wish to design a protein to bind its target, arrange components within a\ncircuit to minimize latency, or find materials with certain properties. Given a\nproperty predictive model, in silico design typically involves training a\ngenerative model over the design space (e.g., protein sequence space) to\nconcentrate on designs with the desired properties. Distributional optimization\n-- which can be formalized as an estimation of distribution algorithm or as\nreinforcement learning policy optimization -- finds the generative model that\nmaximizes an objective function in expectation. Optimizing a distribution over\ndiscrete-valued designs is in general challenging because of the combinatorial\nnature of the design space. However, many property predictors in scientific\napplications are decomposable in the sense that they can be factorized over\ndesign variables in a way that could in principle enable more effective\noptimization. For example, amino acids at a catalytic site of a protein may\nonly loosely interact with amino acids of the rest of the protein to achieve\nmaximal catalytic activity. Current distributional optimization algorithms are\nunable to make use of such decomposability structure. Herein, we propose and\ndemonstrate use of a new distributional optimization algorithm,\nDecomposition-Aware Distributional Optimization (DADO), that can leverage any\ndecomposability defined by a junction tree on the design variables, to make\noptimization more efficient.

If this analogy is correct, token embeddings should not\ntraverse straight paths in feature space; instead, their layer-wise steps\nshould bend and reorient as interactions mediated by embedding space curvature.\nTo test this prediction, we design experiments that expose both the presence\nand the consequences of curvature: (i) we visualize a curvature landscape for a\nfull paragraph, revealing how local turning angles vary across tokens and\nlayers; (ii) we show through simulations that excess counts of sharp/flat\nangles and longer length-to-chord ratios are not explainable by dimensionality\nor chance; and (iii) inspired by Einstein's eclipse experiment, we probe\ndeflection under controlled context edits, demonstrating measurable,\nmeaning-consistent bends in embedding trajectories that confirm\nattention-induced curvature.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u51e0\u4f55\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u7406\u89e3\u57fa\u4e8eTransformer\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5c06\u5176\u4e0e\u5e7f\u4e49\u76f8\u5bf9\u8bba\u8fdb\u884c\u7c7b\u6bd4\u3002\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u5728\u8868\u793a\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u8bf1\u5bfc\u51fa\u6709\u6548\u5ea6\u91cf\uff0c\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u4f5c\u4e3a\u79bb\u6563\u8fde\u63a5\u5b9e\u73b0\u503c\u5411\u91cf\u5728token\u95f4\u7684\u5e76\u884c\u4f20\u8f93\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5d4c\u5165\u7a7a\u95f4\u66f2\u7387\u7684\u5b58\u5728\u53ca\u5176\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c06Transformer\u67b6\u6784\u4e0e\u5e7f\u4e49\u76f8\u5bf9\u8bba\u8fdb\u884c\u7c7b\u6bd4\uff0c\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b0\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u89c6\u89d2\uff0c\u63a2\u7d22\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u5982\u4f55\u5851\u9020\u8868\u793a\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u66f2\u7387\u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e09\u4e2a\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff1a(1)\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\u5b8c\u6574\u6bb5\u843d\u7684\u66f2\u7387\u666f\u89c2\uff1b(2)\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u62df\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5c16\u9510/\u5e73\u5766\u89d2\u5ea6\u548c\u957f\u5ea6-\u5f26\u6bd4\u5f02\u5e38\uff1b(3)\u53d7\u7231\u56e0\u65af\u5766\u65e5\u98df\u5b9e\u9a8c\u542f\u53d1\uff0c\u5728\u53d7\u63a7\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7f16\u8f91\u4e0b\u63a2\u6d4b\u5d4c\u5165\u8f68\u8ff9\u7684\u504f\u8f6c\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5b9e\u4e86\u5d4c\u5165\u7a7a\u95f4\u66f2\u7387\u7684\u5b58\u5728\uff1a\u5c40\u90e8\u8f6c\u5411\u89d2\u5ea6\u5728token\u548c\u5c42\u95f4\u53d8\u5316\uff1b\u5c16\u9510/\u5e73\u5766\u89d2\u5ea6\u548c\u957f\u5ea6-\u5f26\u6bd4\u5f02\u5e38\u65e0\u6cd5\u7528\u7ef4\u5ea6\u6216\u5076\u7136\u6027\u89e3\u91ca\uff1b\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7f16\u8f91\u5bfc\u81f4\u53ef\u6d4b\u91cf\u7684\u3001\u610f\u4e49\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u5d4c\u5165\u8f68\u8ff9\u5f2f\u66f2\u3002", "conclusion": "Transformer\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u786e\u5b9e\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u7c7b\u4f3c\u5e7f\u4e49\u76f8\u5bf9\u8bba\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u8bf1\u5bfc\u7684\u66f2\u7387\u5851\u9020\u4e86token\u5d4c\u5165\u5728\u8868\u793a\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u7684\u6f14\u5316\u8f68\u8ff9\u3002"}}

Yet, the\nstatistical properties of these representations remain poorly controlled,\ncausing misspecified anomaly detection (AD) methods to falter. Weak or rare\nsignals can remain hidden within the apparent regularity of normal data,\ncreating a gap in our ability to detect and interpret anomalies. We examine\nthis gap and identify a set of structural desiderata for detection methods\noperating under minimal prior information: sparsity, to enforce parsimony;\nlocality, to preserve geometric sensitivity; and competition, to promote\nefficient allocation of model capacity. These principles define a class of\nself-organizing local kernels that adaptively partition the representation\nspace around regions of statistical imbalance. As an instantiation of these\nprinciples, we introduce SparKer, a sparse ensemble of Gaussian kernels trained\nwithin a semi-supervised Neyman--Pearson framework to locally model the\nlikelihood ratio between a sample that may contain anomalies and a nominal,\nanomaly-free reference.

We address these\nchallenges by developing Diffusion Co-Design (DiCoDe), a scalable and\nsample-efficient co-design framework pushing co-design towards practically\nrelevant settings. DiCoDe incorporates two core innovations. First, we\nintroduce Projected Universal Guidance (PUG), a sampling technique that enables\nDiCoDe to explore a distribution of reward-maximising environments while\nsatisfying hard constraints such as spatial separation between obstacles.\nSecond, we devise a critic distillation mechanism to share knowledge from the\nreinforcement learning critic, ensuring that the guided diffusion model adapts\nto evolving agent policies using a dense and up-to-date learning signal.\nTogether, these improvements lead to superior environment-policy pairs when\nvalidated on challenging multi-agent environment co-design benchmarks including\nwarehouse automation, multi-agent pathfinding and wind farm optimisation.

However, conventional\napproaches typically rely on prior knowledge of the target domain or require\nmodel retraining, limiting their practicality in dynamic or\nresource-constrained environments. Recent test-time adaptation methods based on\nbatch normalization statistic updates allow for unsupervised adaptation, but\nthey often fail to capture complex activation distributions and are constrained\nto specific normalization layers. We propose Adaptive Quantile Recalibration\n(AQR), a test-time adaptation technique that modifies pre-activation\ndistributions by aligning quantiles on a channel-wise basis. AQR captures the\nfull shape of activation distributions and generalizes across architectures\nemploying BatchNorm, GroupNorm, or LayerNorm. To address the challenge of\nestimating distribution tails under varying batch sizes, AQR incorporates a\nrobust tail calibration strategy that improves stability and precision.

Jin Kim"], "title": "Periodic Skill Discovery", "comment": "NeurIPS 2025", "summary": "Unsupervised skill discovery in reinforcement learning (RL) aims to learn\ndiverse behaviors without relying on external rewards. However, current methods\noften overlook the periodic nature of learned skills, focusing instead on\nincreasing the mutual dependence between states and skills or maximizing the\ndistance traveled in latent space. Considering that many robotic tasks --\nparticularly those involving locomotion -- require periodic behaviors across\nvarying timescales, the ability to discover diverse periodic skills is\nessential. Motivated by this, we propose Periodic Skill Discovery (PSD), a\nframework that discovers periodic behaviors in an unsupervised manner. The key\nidea of PSD is to train an encoder that maps states to a circular latent space,\nthereby naturally encoding periodicity in the latent representation. By\ncapturing temporal distance, PSD can effectively learn skills with diverse\nperiods in complex robotic tasks, even with pixel-based observations.

Existing methods mainly rely on concatenation or the\nKronecker product, oversimplifying the interaction structure between modalities\nand indicating a need to model more complex interactions. Additionally, the\njoint distribution of latent representations with higher-order interactions is\nunderexplored.

Therefore, we introduce\nSORTD, a novel framework that improves scalability and enumerates trees in the\nRashomon set in order of the objective value, thus offering anytime behavior.\nOur experiments show that SORTD reduces runtime by up to two orders of\nmagnitude compared with the state of the art. Moreover, SORTD can compute\nRashomon sets for any separable and totally ordered objective and supports\npost-evaluating the set using other separable (and partially ordered)\nobjectives.

Unlike\ntraditional intent recognition systems that depend on large, annotated corpora\nand often struggle with fine-grained, multi-label discrimination, our approach\neliminates the need for costly data collection while enhancing the accuracy of\nmulti-label intention understanding. Specifically, the overall pipeline, named\nDMTC, consists of three steps: 1) using prompt engineering to guide large\nlanguage models (LLMs) to generate diverse synthetic queries in different\ntransport scenarios; 2) encoding each textual query with a Sentence-T5 model to\nobtain compact semantic embeddings; 3) training a lightweight classifier using\na novel online focal-contrastive (OFC) loss that emphasizes hard samples and\nmaximizes inter-class separability. The applicability of the proposed pipeline\nis demonstrated in an agentic AI application in the maritime transportation\ncontext. Extensive experiments show that DMTC achieves a Hamming loss of 5.35%\nand an AUC of 95.92%, outperforming state-of-the-art multi-label classifiers\nand recent end-to-end SOTA LLM-based baselines. Further analysis reveals that\nSentence-T5 embeddings improve subset accuracy by at least 3.29% over\nalternative encoders, and integrating the OFC loss yields an additional 0.98%\ngain compared to standard contrastive objectives. In conclusion, our system\nseamlessly routes user queries to task-specific modules (e.g., ETA information,\ntraffic risk evaluation, and other typical scenarios in the transportation\ndomain), laying the groundwork for fully autonomous, intention-aware agents\nwithout costly manual labelling.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u6570\u636e\u7684\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u591a\u6807\u7b7e\u610f\u56fe\u8bc6\u522b\u7ba1\u9053DMTC\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u63d0\u793a\u5de5\u7a0b\u751f\u6210\u5408\u6210\u67e5\u8be2\u3001Sentence-T5\u7f16\u7801\u548c\u5728\u7ebf\u7126\u70b9\u5bf9\u6bd4\u635f\u5931\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u5728\u4ea4\u901a\u9886\u57df\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u610f\u56fe\u8bc6\u522b\u7cfb\u7edf\u4f9d\u8d56\u5927\u91cf\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u4e14\u96be\u4ee5\u5904\u7406\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u591a\u6807\u7b7e\u5206\u7c7b\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u6d88\u9664\u6602\u8d35\u7684\u6570\u636e\u6536\u96c6\u9700\u6c42\u5e76\u63d0\u9ad8\u591a\u6807\u7b7e\u610f\u56fe\u7406\u89e3\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u4e09\u9636\u6bb5\u7ba1\u9053\uff1a1) \u4f7f\u7528\u63d0\u793a\u5de5\u7a0b\u5f15\u5bfcLLM\u751f\u6210\u591a\u6837\u5316\u5408\u6210\u67e5\u8be2\uff1b2) \u7528Sentence-T5\u6a21\u578b\u7f16\u7801\u6587\u672c\u67e5\u8be2\u83b7\u5f97\u8bed\u4e49\u5d4c\u5165\uff1b3) \u4f7f\u7528\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u5728\u7ebf\u7126\u70b9\u5bf9\u6bd4\u635f\u5931\u8bad\u7ec3\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6d77\u4e0a\u4ea4\u901a\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\uff0cDMTC\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e865.35%\u7684\u6c49\u660e\u635f\u5931\u548c95.92%\u7684AUC\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u591a\u6807\u7b7e\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u548cLLM\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002Sentence-T5\u5d4c\u5165\u6bd4\u66ff\u4ee3\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u63d0\u9ad8\u5b50\u96c6\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u81f3\u5c113.29%\uff0cOFC\u635f\u5931\u76f8\u6bd4\u6807\u51c6\u5bf9\u6bd4\u76ee\u6807\u5e26\u6765\u989d\u59160.98%\u589e\u76ca\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7cfb\u7edf\u80fd\u591f\u65e0\u7f1d\u5730\u5c06\u7528\u6237\u67e5\u8be2\u8def\u7531\u5230\u7279\u5b9a\u4efb\u52a1\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u4e3a\u65e0\u9700\u6602\u8d35\u4eba\u5de5\u6807\u6ce8\u7684\u5b8c\u5168\u81ea\u4e3b\u610f\u56fe\u611f\u77e5\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5960\u5b9a\u4e86\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

The projection is differentiable and adds only about 10%\ncomputational overhead, making it fully compatible with back-propagation. We\nfurther stabilize training with total-variation damping (TVD) to suppress small\noscillations and a rollout curriculum that enforces consistency over long\nprediction horizons.

Our main algorithm, Deep Implicit Imitation\nQ-Network (DIIQN), employs an action inference mechanism that reconstructs\nexpert actions through online exploration and integrates a dynamic confidence\nmechanism that adaptively balances expert-guided and self-directed learning.\nThis enables the agent to leverage expert guidance for accelerated training\nwhile maintaining capacity to surpass suboptimal expert performance. We further\nextend our framework with a Heterogeneous Actions DIIQN (HA-DIIQN) algorithm to\ntackle scenarios where expert and agent possess different action sets, a\nchallenge previously unaddressed in the implicit imitation learning literature.\nHA-DIIQN introduces an infeasibility detection mechanism and a bridging\nprocedure identifying alternative pathways connecting agent capabilities to\nexpert guidance when direct action replication is impossible. Our experimental\nresults demonstrate that DIIQN achieves up to 130% higher episodic returns\ncompared to standard DQN, while consistently outperforming existing implicit\nimitation methods that cannot exceed expert performance. In heterogeneous\naction settings, HA-DIIQN learns up to 64% faster than baselines, leveraging\nexpert datasets unusable by conventional approaches. Extensive parameter\nsensitivity analysis reveals the framework's robustness across varying dataset\nsizes and hyperparameter configurations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u6df1\u5ea6\u9690\u5f0f\u6a21\u4eff\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u6df1\u5ea6\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u4ec5\u89c2\u5bdf\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u9690\u5f0f\u6a21\u4eff\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4f20\u7edf\u6a21\u4eff\u5b66\u4e60\u9700\u8981\u5b8c\u6574\u72b6\u6001-\u52a8\u4f5c\u6f14\u793a\u548c\u6700\u4f18\u4e13\u5bb6\u7684\u9650\u5236\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u6a21\u4eff\u5b66\u4e60\u9700\u8981\u5b8c\u6574\u7684\u72b6\u6001-\u52a8\u4f5c\u6f14\u793a\u548c\u6700\u4f18\u4e13\u5bb6\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e25\u91cd\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u8bb8\u591a\u73b0\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u4ec5\u63d0\u4f9b\u72b6\u6001\u89c2\u5bdf\u800c\u6ca1\u6709\u5bf9\u5e94\u52a8\u4f5c\uff0c\u4e14\u4e13\u5bb6\u8868\u73b0\u5f80\u5f80\u6b21\u4f18\u3002", "method": "\u4e3b\u8981\u7b97\u6cd5DIIQN\u91c7\u7528\u52a8\u4f5c\u63a8\u65ad\u673a\u5236\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u7ebf\u63a2\u7d22\u91cd\u5efa\u4e13\u5bb6\u52a8\u4f5c\uff0c\u5e76\u96c6\u6210\u52a8\u6001\u7f6e\u4fe1\u673a\u5236\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5e73\u8861\u4e13\u5bb6\u5f15\u5bfc\u548c\u81ea\u4e3b\u5b66\u4e60\u3002HA-DIIQN\u7b97\u6cd5\u5904\u7406\u4e13\u5bb6\u548c\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5177\u6709\u4e0d\u540c\u52a8\u4f5c\u96c6\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u4e0d\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u68c0\u6d4b\u673a\u5236\u548c\u6865\u63a5\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "result": "DIIQN\u76f8\u6bd4\u6807\u51c6DQN\u83b7\u5f97\u9ad8\u8fbe130%\u7684\u66f4\u9ad8\u56de\u5408\u56de\u62a5\uff0c\u6301\u7eed\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65e0\u6cd5\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e13\u5bb6\u8868\u73b0\u7684\u9690\u5f0f\u6a21\u4eff\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u5728\u5f02\u6784\u52a8\u4f5c\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e2d\uff0cHA-DIIQN\u5b66\u4e60\u901f\u5ea6\u6bd4\u57fa\u7ebf\u5feb64%\uff0c\u53ef\u5229\u7528\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u65e0\u6cd5\u4f7f\u7528\u7684\u4e13\u5bb6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u6df1\u5ea6\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u9690\u5f0f\u6a21\u4eff\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u6a21\u4eff\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u4f7f\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u80fd\u591f\u5229\u7528\u4e13\u5bb6\u6307\u5bfc\u52a0\u901f\u8bad\u7ec3\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u8d85\u8d8a\u6b21\u4f18\u4e13\u5bb6\u8868\u73b0\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

We introduce Behavior-Adaptive\nQ-Learning (BAQ), a framework designed to enable a smooth and reliable\ntransition from offline to online RL. The key idea is to leverage an implicit\nbehavioral model derived from offline data to provide a behavior-consistency\nsignal during online fine-tuning. BAQ incorporates a dual-objective loss that\n(i) aligns the online policy toward the offline behavior when uncertainty is\nhigh, and (ii) gradually relaxes this constraint as more confident online\nexperience is accumulated.

Under Review", "summary": "Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has emerged as a\npowerful paradigm for post-training large reasoning models (LRMs) using\npolicy-gradient methods such as GRPO. To stabilize training, these methods\ntypically center trajectory rewards by subtracting the empirical mean for each\nprompt. Statistically, this centering acts as a control variate (or baseline),\nreducing the variance of the policy-gradient estimator.\n  Typically, the mean reward is estimated using per-prompt empirical averages\nfor each prompt in a batch. Drawing inspiration from Stein's paradox, we\npropose using shrinkage estimators that combine per-prompt and across-prompt\nmeans to improve the overall per-prompt mean estimation accuracy --\nparticularly in the low-generation regime typical of RLVR. Theoretically, we\nconstruct a shrinkage-based baseline that provably yields lower-variance\npolicy-gradient estimators across algorithms. Our proposed baseline serves as a\ndrop-in replacement for existing per-prompt mean baselines, requiring no\nadditional hyper-parameters or computation. Empirically, shrinkage baselines\nconsistently outperform standard empirical-mean baselines, leading to\nlower-variance gradient updates and improved training stability.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6536\u7f29\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u6539\u8fdb\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7b56\u7565\u68af\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\u7684\u65b9\u5dee\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5956\u52b1\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u573a\u666f\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5956\u52b1\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\uff0c\u901a\u5e38\u4f7f\u7528\u6bcf\u4e2a\u63d0\u793a\u7684\u5b9e\u8bc1\u5e73\u5747\u503c\u4f5c\u4e3a\u57fa\u7ebf\u6765\u7a33\u5b9a\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u5728\u4f4e\u751f\u6210\u6570\u91cf\u7684\u5178\u578b\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u4f30\u8ba1\u53ef\u80fd\u4e0d\u591f\u51c6\u786e\u3002\u53d7Stein\u6096\u8bba\u7684\u542f\u53d1\uff0c\u4f5c\u8005\u5e0c\u671b\u901a\u8fc7\u6536\u7f29\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\u7ed3\u5408\u6bcf\u4e2a\u63d0\u793a\u548c\u8de8\u63d0\u793a\u7684\u5747\u503c\u6765\u63d0\u9ad8\u4f30\u8ba1\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4f7f\u7528\u6536\u7f29\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\uff0c\u5c06\u6bcf\u4e2a\u63d0\u793a\u7684\u5747\u503c\u4e0e\u8de8\u63d0\u793a\u7684\u5747\u503c\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u6536\u7f29\u7684\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u65e0\u9700\u989d\u5916\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u6216\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u53ef\u76f4\u63a5\u66ff\u4ee3\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u6bcf\u4e2a\u63d0\u793a\u5747\u503c\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002", "result": "\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u6536\u7f29\u57fa\u7ebf\u80fd\u591f\u4ea7\u751f\u66f4\u4f4e\u65b9\u5dee\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u68af\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\u3002\u5b9e\u8bc1\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u6536\u7f29\u57fa\u7ebf\u59cb\u7ec8\u4f18\u4e8e\u6807\u51c6\u5b9e\u8bc1\u5747\u503c\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u68af\u5ea6\u66f4\u65b0\u7684\u65b9\u5dee\u66f4\u4f4e\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u66f4\u597d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6536\u7f29\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5956\u52b1\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u6709\u6548\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u7b56\u7565\u68af\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u65b9\u5dee\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u8bad\u7ec3\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u4e14\u6613\u4e8e\u5b9e\u73b0\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u989d\u5916\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u3002"}}
