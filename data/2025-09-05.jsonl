This naturally reduces reliance on I/O, off-chip\nmemory, and host control. By leveraging fine-grained message passing on a\nprogrammable, message-based compute architecture, the framework keeps data\nmovement local and coordinates computation across the array using techniques\nsuch as stationary-weight reuse, in-array multicasting, and staged reductions.\nApplied to VGG-19, the framework sustains high utilization (88 to 92 percent),\nwith over 97 percent of messages generated internally and nearly 89 percent of\ntime consumed on-chip transfers. Computation throughput scales beyond 1 TFLOP/s\non larger arrays, while traffic reductions from reuse and local aggregation\nreach up to 100 MB per layer.

Selecting the optimal balance is a critical challenge that can be\nframed as a multi-objective optimization (MOO) problem where one first\ndiscovers the set of optimal trade-offs (the Pareto front) and then learns a\ndecision-maker's preference over them. While a rich body of work on interactive\nMOO exists, the standard approach -- modeling the objective functions with\ngeneric surrogates and learning preferences from simple pairwise feedback -- is\ninefficient for DP because it fails to leverage the problem's unique structure:\na point on the Pareto front can be generated directly by maximizing accuracy\nfor a fixed privacy level. Motivated by this property, we first derive the\nshape of the trade-off theoretically, which allows us to model the Pareto front\ndirectly and efficiently.
