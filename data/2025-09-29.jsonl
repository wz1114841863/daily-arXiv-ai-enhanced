Such data, encompassing the types of kernels executed and the time\nspent in each, is crucial for optimizing chip design and enhancing application\nperformance. Unfortunately, despite the availability of low-level tools like\nNSYS and NCU, current methodologies fall short, offering data collection\ncapabilities only on an individual user basis rather than a broader, more\ninformative fleet-wide scale. This paper takes on the problem of realizing a\nsystem that allows planet-scale real-time GPU performance profiling of\nlow-level hardware characteristics. The three fundamental problems we solve\nare: i) user experience of achieving this with no slowdown; ii) preserving user\nprivacy, so that no 3rd party is aware of what applications any user runs; iii)\nefficacy in showing we are able to collect data and assign it applications even\nwhen run on 1000s of GPUs.

Accordingly, we design a null-space projector that preserves prior\nresponses by filtering out overlapping components of new task vectors, thereby\nensuring transparency, and a lightweight LoRA adapter that injects\ncomplementary task-specific signals, enabling fidelity in adapting to new\ntasks. The adapter is trained with a projection-based surrogate loss to retain\nconsistency with previous knowledge while introducing novel directions.

In (I), $G_F$ is random, and top layer overfits to random hidden\nrepresentation. In (II), the gradient of each node (column of $G_F$) only\ndepends on its own activation, and thus each hidden node learns their\nrepresentation independently from $G_F$, which now carries information about\ntarget labels, thanks to weight decay.

This basic\nmechanism supports LLMs' ability to copy and predict repeating patterns.\nHowever, it is unclear if this same mechanism can support in-context learning\nof more complex repetitive patterns with hierarchical structure. Natural\nlanguage is teeming with such cases: The article \"the\" in English usually\nprefaces multiple nouns in a text. When predicting which token succeeds a\nparticular instance of \"the\", we need to integrate further contextual cues from\nthe text to predict the correct noun. If induction heads naively attend to all\npast instances of successor tokens of \"the\" in a context-independent manner,\nthey cannot support this level of contextual information integration. In this\nstudy, we design a synthetic in-context learning task, where tokens are\nrepeated with hierarchical dependencies. Here, attending uniformly to all\nsuccessor tokens is not sufficient to accurately predict future tokens.\nEvaluating a range of LLMs on these token sequences and natural language\nanalogues, we find adaptive induction heads that support prediction by learning\nwhat to attend to in-context. Next, we investigate how induction heads\nthemselves learn in-context.

However, existing symbolic regression methods\noften use complexity metrics as a proxy for interoperability, which only\nconsiders the size of the formula but ignores its internal mathematical\nstructure. Therefore, while they can discover formulas with compact forms, the\ndiscovered formulas often have structures that are difficult to analyze or\ninterpret mathematically. In this work, inspired by the observation that\nphysical formulas are typically numerically stable under limited calculation\nprecision, we propose the Effective Information Criterion (EIC). It treats\nformulas as information processing systems with specific internal structures\nand identifies the unreasonable structure in them by the loss of significant\ndigits or the amplification of rounding noise as data flows through the system.\nWe find that this criterion reveals the gap between the structural rationality\nof models discovered by existing symbolic regression algorithms and real-world\nphysical formulas. Combining EIC with various search-based symbolic regression\nalgorithms improves their performance on the Pareto frontier and reduces the\nirrational structure in the results. Combining EIC with generative-based\nalgorithms reduces the number of samples required for pre-training, improving\nsample efficiency by 2~4 times.

However, in existing\ndistillation methods, teacher models predominantly adhere to ground-truth\nlabels as targets, without considering the diverse representations within the\nsame class. Therefore, we propose incorporating an intra-class contrastive loss\nduring teacher training to enrich the intra-class information contained in soft\nlabels. In practice, we find that intra-class loss causes instability in\ntraining and slows convergence. To mitigate these issues, margin loss is\nintegrated into intra-class contrastive learning to improve the training\nstability and convergence speed.

We provide theoretical results on the evolution of these\ngraphs during training, showing that nonlinear activations play a crucial role\nin shaping feature geometry in feedforward neural networks. Moreover, we\ndiscover that the geometric transformations resemble a discrete Ricci flow on\nthese graphs, suggesting that neural feature geometry evolves analogous to\nRicci flow. This connection is supported by experiments on over 20,000\nfeedforward neural networks trained on binary classification tasks across both\nsynthetic and real-world datasets. We observe that the emergence of class\nseparability corresponds to the emergence of community structure in the\nassociated graph representations, which is known to relate to discrete Ricci\nflow dynamics. Building on these insights, we introduce a novel framework for\nlocally evaluating geometric transformations through comparison with discrete\nRicci flow dynamics.

Our analysis\nestablishes a clear chain of guarantees by decomposing the final distribution\nestimation error. We first prove that the total variation distance between the\ngenerated and target distributions is controlled by the risk of the learned\nvelocity field. We then bound this risk by analyzing its two primary sources:\n(i) Approximation Error, where we quantify the capacity of the Transformer\narchitecture to represent the true velocity, and (ii) Estimation Error, where\nwe derive statistical convergence rates that bound the error from training on a\nfinite dataset. By composing these results, we provide the first formal proof\nthat the distribution generated by a trained DFM model provably converges to\nthe true data distribution as the training set size increases."}

Sturtevant"], "title": "Learning Admissible Heuristics for A*: Theory and Practice", "comment": null, "summary": "Heuristic functions are central to the performance of search algorithms such\nas A-star, where admissibility - the property of never overestimating the true\nshortest-path cost - guarantees solution optimality. Recent deep learning\napproaches often disregard admissibility and provide limited guarantees on\ngeneralization beyond the training data. This paper addresses both of these\nlimitations. First, we pose heuristic learning as a constrained optimization\nproblem and introduce Cross-Entropy Admissibility (CEA), a loss function that\nenforces admissibility during training. On the Rubik's Cube domain, this method\nyields near-admissible heuristics with significantly stronger guidance than\ncompressed pattern database (PDB) heuristics. Theoretically, we study the\nsample complexity of learning heuristics. By leveraging PDB abstractions and\nthe structural properties of graphs such as the Rubik's Cube, we tighten the\nbound on the number of training samples needed for A-star to generalize.\nReplacing a general hypothesis class with a ReLU neural network gives bounds\nthat depend primarily on the network's width and depth, rather than on graph\nsize. Using the same network, we also provide the first generalization\nguarantees for goal-dependent heuristics."}

This\npaper introduces a novel deep learning framework for high-fidelity,\n``in-the-wild'' simulation on production hardware. Our core contribution is a\nDL model trained on microarchitecture-independent features to predict\ncycle-level performance for hypothetical processor designs. This unique\napproach allows the model to be deployed on existing silicon to evaluate future\nhardware. We propose a complete system featuring a lightweight hardware trace\ncollector and a principled sampling strategy to minimize user impact. This\nsystem achieves a simulation speed of 5 MIPS on a commodity GPU, imposing a\nmere 0.1% performance overhead. Furthermore, our co-designed Neutrino on-chip\naccelerator improves performance by 85x over the GPU. We demonstrate that this\nframework enables accurate performance analysis and large-scale hardware A/B\ntesting on a massive scale using real-world applications."}
