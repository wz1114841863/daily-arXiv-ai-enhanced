Moreover, the schedule may determine intermediate nodes where both objects and transactions meet. Our goal is to minimize the total combined cost of the schedule. We focus on networks of constant doubling dimension, which appear frequently in practice. We consider a batch problem where an arbitrary set of nodes has transactions that need to be scheduled. First, we consider a single shared object required by all the transactions and present a scheduling algorithm that gives an $O(\\log n \\cdot \\log D)$ approximation of the optimal schedule, where $n$ is the number of nodes and $D$ is the diameter of the network. Later, we consider transactions accessing multiple shared objects (at most $k$ objects per transaction) and provide a scheduling algorithm that gives an $O(k \\cdot \\log n \\cdot \\log D)$ approximation.

Traditional manual tuning methods incur prohibitive trial-and-error costs, and existing performance modeling approaches exhibit critical limitations: they fail to comprehensively account for prevalent optimization features and ignore the substantial overhead imposed by essential fault tolerance mechanisms like checkpoint recovery in long-duration pretraining. To address these gaps, we propose MoFa, a novel pretraining performance modeling framework that unifies multi-dimensional optimization features and fault tolerance. MoFa incorporates an enhanced cost model to accurately capture the effects of key optimizations and integrates a fault tolerance model based on historical cluster reliability data. Besides, a MoFa-based tuning system is developed to explore optimal pretraining performance and potential bottlenecks in various scenarios. Extensive modeling evaluations demonstrate that MoFa can achieve high prediction accuracy across various scenarios. In addition, through comprehensive tuning experiments, our framework systematically reveals the key factors influencing pretraining performance under different configurations, which provides solid a priori guidance for LLM pretraining system design and deployment.", "AI": {"tldr": "MoFa\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6027\u80fd\u5efa\u6a21\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7edf\u4e00\u4e86\u591a\u7ef4\u4f18\u5316\u7279\u5f81\u548c\u5bb9\u9519\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86LLM\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u5316\u6311\u6218\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740LLM\u53c2\u6570\u89c4\u6a21\u4ece\u6570\u5341\u4ebf\u589e\u957f\u5230\u6570\u4e07\u4ebf\uff0c\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u5728\u6570\u5343\u5230\u6570\u4e07\u53f0\u8bbe\u5907\u96c6\u7fa4\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u3002\u6df7\u5408\u5e76\u884c\u7b56\u7565\u867d\u7136\u53ef\u884c\uff0c\u4f46\u5de8\u5927\u7684\u7ec4\u5408\u7b56\u7565\u7a7a\u95f4\u5e26\u6765\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u6311\u6218\u3002\u4f20\u7edf\u624b\u52a8\u8c03\u4f18\u65b9\u6cd5\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u6602\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u6027\u80fd\u5efa\u6a21\u65b9\u6cd5\u65e0\u6cd5\u5168\u9762\u8003\u8651\u4f18\u5316\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u4e14\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u68c0\u67e5\u70b9\u6062\u590d\u7b49\u5bb9\u9519\u673a\u5236\u7684\u5f00\u9500\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faMoFa\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u589e\u5f3a\u7684\u6210\u672c\u6a21\u578b\u6765\u51c6\u786e\u6355\u6349\u5173\u952e\u4f18\u5316\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u5e76\u57fa\u4e8e\u5386\u53f2\u96c6\u7fa4\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u6210\u5bb9\u9519\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8eMoFa\u7684\u8c03\u4f18\u7cfb\u7edf\u6765\u63a2\u7d22\u6700\u4f18\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u6f5c\u5728\u74f6\u9888\u3002", "result": "\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u5efa\u6a21\u8bc4\u4f30\u8868\u660e\uff0cMoFa\u5728\u5404\u79cd\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u90fd\u80fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u9884\u6d4b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5168\u9762\u8c03\u4f18\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u914d\u7f6e\u4e0b\u5f71\u54cd\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5173\u952e\u56e0\u7d20\u3002", "conclusion": "MoFa\u4e3aLLM\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bbe\u8ba1\u548c\u90e8\u7f72\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u5148\u9a8c\u6307\u5bfc\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

Despite being highly performant, GPU systems suffer from performance variation at the node and cluster levels. Such performance variation significantly impacts both high-performance computing and artificial intelligence workloads, such as cutting-edge large language models (LLMs). We analyze the performance of a single-node multi-GPU system running LLM training, and observe that the kernel-level performance variation is highly correlated with concurrent computation communication (C3), a technique to overlap computation and communication across GPUs for performance gains. We then take a further step to reason that thermally induced straggling coupling with C3 impacts performance variation, coined as the Lit Silicon effect. Lit Silicon describes that in a multi-GPU node, thermal imbalance across GPUs introduces node-level straggler GPUs, which in turn slow down the leader GPUs. Lit Silicon leads to node-level performance variation and inefficiency, impacting the entire datacenter from the bottom up. We propose analytical performance and power models for Lit Silicon, to understand the potential system-level gains. We further design simple detection and mitigation techniques to effectively address the Lit Silicon problem, and evaluate three different power management solutions, including power optimization under GPU thermal design power, performance optimization under node-level GPU power capping, and performance optimization under node-level CPU power sloshing. We conduct experiments on two workloads on two AMD InstinctTM MI300X GPU systems under two LLM training frameworks, and observe up to 6% performance and 4% power improvements, potentially saving hundreds of millions of dollars in datacenters.

To address this limitation, this paper introduces a novel, history-aware trajectory k-anonymization methodology and presents an advanced FPGA-based hardware architecture to implement it. Our proposed architecture uniquely integrates par- allel history-based trajectory searches with conventional shortest- path finding, using a custom fixed-point counting module to ac- curately weigh contributions from historical data. This approach enables the system to prioritize behaviorally common routes over geometrically shorter but less-traveled paths. The FPGA implementation demonstrates that our new architecture achieves a real-time throughput of over 6,000 records/s, improves data retention by up to 1.2% compared to our previous shortest-path- only design, and preserves major arterial roads more effectively.

Unfortunately, the time the CPU spends on setup control and synchronization has increased with growing accelerator complexity. For systems with complex accelerators, this means that performance can be configuration-bound. Faster accelerators are more severely impacted by this overlooked performance drop, which we call the configuration wall. Prior work evidences this wall and proposes ad-hoc solutions to reduce configuration overhead. However, these solutions are not universally applicable, nor do they offer comprehensive insights into the underlying causes of performance degradation. In this work, we first introduce a widely-applicable variant of the well-known roofline model to quantify when system performance is configuration-bound. To move systems out of the performance-bound region, we subsequently propose a domain-specific compiler abstraction and associated optimization passes. We implement the abstraction and passes in the MLIR compiler framework to run optimized binaries on open-source architectures to prove its effectiveness and generality. Experiments demonstrate a geomean performance boost of 2x on the open-source OpenGeMM system, by eliminating redundant configuration cycles and by automatically hiding the remaining configuration cycles.

However, the task is challenging due to its large label space (10,000 to 20,000 codes) and long-tail distribution, where a few codes dominate while many rare codes lack sufficient training data. To address this, we propose a learning method that models fine-grained co-occurrence relationships among codes. Specifically, we construct a Directed Bipartite Graph Encoder with disjoint sets of common and rare code nodes. To facilitate a one-way information flow, edges are directed exclusively from common to rare codes. The nature of these connections is defined by a probability-based bias, which is derived from the conditional probability of a common code co-occurring given the presence of a rare code. This bias is then injected into the encoder's attention module, a process we term Co-occurrence Encoding. This structure empowers the graph encoder to enrich rare code representations by aggregating latent comorbidity information reflected in the statistical co-occurrence of their common counterparts. To ensure high-quality input to the graph, we utilize a large language model (LLM) to generate comprehensive descriptions for codes, enriching initial embeddings with clinical context and comorbidity information, serving as external knowledge for the statistical co-occurrence relationships in the code system.

The paper proposes a novel solution, CacheX, which probes accurate and fine-grained cache abstraction within VMs using eviction sets without requiring hardware or hypervisor support, and showcases the utility of the probed information with two new techniques: LLC contention-aware task scheduling and virtual color-aware page cache management.

Existing assertion generation methods based on design specifications typically produce only top-level assertions, overlooking verification needs on the implementation details in the modules at the micro-architectural level, where design errors occur more frequently. To address this limitation, we present AssertMiner, a module-level assertion generation framework that leverages static information generated from abstract syntax tree (AST) to assist LLMs in mining assertions. Specifically, it performs AST-based structural extraction to derive the module call graph, I/O table, and dataflow graph, guiding the LLM to generate module-level specifications and mine module-level assertions. Our evaluation demonstrates that AssertMiner outperforms existing methods such as AssertLLM and Spec2Assertion in generating high-quality assertions for modules.

Its main limitation is drafter-verifier misalignment, which limits token acceptance and reduces overall effectiveness. While small drafting heads trained from scratch compensate with speed, they struggle when verification dominates latency or when inputs are out of distribution. In contrast, pretrained drafters, though slower, achieve higher acceptance rates thanks to stronger standalone generation capabilities, making them competitive when drafting latency is negligible relative to verification or communication overhead. In this work, we aim to improve the acceptance rates of pretrained drafters by introducing a lightweight dynamic alignment mechanism: a steering vector computed from the verifier's hidden states and injected into the pretrained drafter. Compared to existing offline alignment methods such as distillation, our approach boosts the number of accepted tokens by up to 35\\% under standard sampling and 22\\% under greedy sampling, all while incurring negligible computational overhead.

In practice, grouping often comes at the expense of key metrics such calibration error and predictive accuracy. This is due to the restrictive inductive bias that mixture-of-experts imposes, that predictions for individual patients must look like predictions for the group they're assigned to. Might we be able to discover patient group structure, where it exists, while improving calibration and predictive accuracy? In this work, we introduce several discrete-time deep mixture-of-experts (MoE) based architectures for survival analysis problems, one of which achieves all desiderata: clustering, calibration, and predictive accuracy. We show that a key differentiator between this array of MoEs is how expressive their experts are. We find that more expressive experts that tailor predictions per patient outperform experts that rely on fixed group prototypes.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u51e0\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u79bb\u6563\u65f6\u95f4\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u6df7\u5408\u4e13\u5bb6\u6a21\u578b\u7528\u4e8e\u751f\u5b58\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u4e00\u79cd\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u591f\u540c\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u805a\u7c7b\u3001\u6821\u51c6\u548c\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u7684\u76ee\u6807\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u4e13\u5bb6\u6a21\u578b\u901a\u8fc7\u4e3a\u6bcf\u4e2a\u60a3\u8005\u5b9a\u5236\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f9d\u8d56\u56fa\u5b9a\u7ec4\u539f\u578b\u7684\u4e13\u5bb6\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u4e13\u5bb6\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u751f\u5b58\u5206\u6790\u4e2d\u867d\u7136\u80fd\u591f\u805a\u7c7b\u76f8\u4f3c\u60a3\u8005\uff0c\u4f46\u5f80\u5f80\u4ee5\u727a\u7272\u6821\u51c6\u8bef\u5dee\u548c\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e3a\u4ee3\u4ef7\u3002\u8fd9\u662f\u56e0\u4e3a\u6df7\u5408\u4e13\u5bb6\u6a21\u578b\u65bd\u52a0\u4e86\u9650\u5236\u6027\u5f52\u7eb3\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u5373\u4e2a\u4f53\u60a3\u8005\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u5fc5\u987b\u4e0e\u5176\u6240\u5c5e\u7ec4\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u76f8\u4f3c\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u591a\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u79bb\u6563\u65f6\u95f4\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u6df7\u5408\u4e13\u5bb6\u67b6\u6784\u7528\u4e8e\u751f\u5b58\u5206\u6790\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\u6c34\u5e73\u7684\u4e13\u5bb6\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u4e13\u5bb6\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u591f\u4e3a\u6bcf\u4e2a\u60a3\u8005\u5b9a\u5236\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5728\u805a\u7c7b\u3001\u6821\u51c6\u548c\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u90fd\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u597d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5728\u751f\u5b58\u5206\u6790\u4e2d\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u4e13\u5bb6\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u591f\u540c\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u60a3\u8005\u805a\u7c7b\u3001\u6a21\u578b\u6821\u51c6\u548c\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u7684\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f9d\u8d56\u56fa\u5b9a\u7ec4\u539f\u578b\u7684\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

This paper proposes a lightweight server-selection method for edge applications that fuses latency prediction with adaptive reliability and hysteresis-based handover. Using passive measurements (arrival rate, utilization, payload size) and an exponentially modulated rational delay model, the proposed Moderate Handover (MO-HAN) method computes a score that balances predicted latency and reliability to ensure handovers occur only when the expected gain is meaningful and maintain reduced end-to-end latency. Results show that MO-HAN consistently outperforms static and fair-distribution baselines by lowering mean and tail latencies, while reducing handovers by nearly 50% compared to pure opportunistic selection. These gains arise without intrusive instrumentation or heavy learning infrastructure, making MO-HAN practical for resource-constrained embedded devices.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u7684\u8fb9\u7f18\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u9009\u62e9\u65b9\u6cd5MO-HAN\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u878d\u5408\u5ef6\u8fdf\u9884\u6d4b\u3001\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u6ede\u540e\u7684\u5207\u6362\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5728\u964d\u4f4e\u5ef6\u8fdf\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u51cf\u5c1150%\u7684\u5207\u6362\u6b21\u6570\u3002", "motivation": "\u591a\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u67b6\u6784\u4e2d\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u7f51\u7edc\u62e5\u585e\u7ed9\u5ef6\u8fdf\u654f\u611f\u7684\u5d4c\u5165\u5f0f\u5e94\u7528\u5e26\u6765\u4e86\u8fb9\u7f18\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u9009\u62e9\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u4e14\u6709\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u88ab\u52a8\u6d4b\u91cf\uff08\u5230\u8fbe\u7387\u3001\u5229\u7528\u7387\u3001\u8d1f\u8f7d\u5927\u5c0f\uff09\u548c\u6307\u6570\u8c03\u5236\u6709\u7406\u5ef6\u8fdf\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u5e73\u8861\u9884\u6d4b\u5ef6\u8fdf\u548c\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u7684\u5206\u6570\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u53ea\u5728\u9884\u671f\u6536\u76ca\u6709\u610f\u4e49\u65f6\u8fdb\u884c\u5207\u6362\u3002", "result": "MO-HAN\u5728\u964d\u4f4e\u5e73\u5747\u548c\u5c3e\u90e8\u5ef6\u8fdf\u65b9\u9762\u6301\u7eed\u4f18\u4e8e\u9759\u6001\u548c\u516c\u5e73\u5206\u914d\u57fa\u51c6\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u76f8\u6bd4\u7eaf\u673a\u4f1a\u9009\u62e9\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u8fd150%\u7684\u5207\u6362\u6b21\u6570\u3002", "conclusion": "MO-HAN\u65e0\u9700\u4fb5\u5165\u5f0f\u68c0\u6d4b\u6216\u91cd\u578b\u5b66\u4e60\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u7684\u5d4c\u5165\u5f0f\u8bbe\u5907\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5ef6\u8fdf\u964d\u4f4e\u548c\u5207\u6362\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u53cc\u91cd\u76ee\u6807\u3002"}}

Alexandropoulos"], "title": "Filtering Jump Markov Systems with Partially Known Dynamics: A Model-Based Deep Learning Approach", "comment": "Submitted to an IEEE transactions journal, copyright may be transfered upon acceptance", "summary": "This paper presents the Jump Markov Filtering Network (JMFNet), a novel model-based deep learning framework for real-time state-state estimation in jump Markov systems with unknown noise statistics and mode transition dynamics. A hybrid architecture comprising two Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) is proposed: one for mode prediction and another for filtering that is based on a mode-augmented version of the recently presented KalmanNet architecture. The proposed RNNs are trained jointly using an alternating least squares strategy that enables mutual adaptation without supervision of the latent modes. Extensive numerical experiments on linear and nonlinear systems, including target tracking, pendulum angle tracking, Lorenz attractor dynamics, and a real-life dataset demonstrate that the proposed JMFNet framework outperforms classical model-based filters (e.g., interacting multiple models and particle filters) as well as model-free deep learning baselines, particularly in non-stationary and high-noise regimes. It is also showcased that JMFNet achieves a small yet meaningful improvement over the KalmanNet framework, which becomes much more pronounced in complicated systems or long trajectories. Finally, the method's performance is empirically validated to be consistent and reliable, exhibiting low sensitivity to initial conditions, hyperparameter selection, as well as to incorrect model knowledge", "AI": {"tldr": "JMFNet\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5177\u6709\u672a\u77e5\u566a\u58f0\u7edf\u8ba1\u548c\u6a21\u5f0f\u8f6c\u6362\u52a8\u6001\u7684\u8df3\u53d8\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5b9e\u65f6\u72b6\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u3002\u8be5\u6df7\u5408\u67b6\u6784\u5305\u542b\u4e24\u4e2aRNN\uff1a\u4e00\u4e2a\u7528\u4e8e\u6a21\u5f0f\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u53e6\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8eKalmanNet\u7684\u6ee4\u6ce2\u7f51\u7edc\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u4ea4\u66ff\u6700\u5c0f\u4e8c\u4e58\u7b56\u7565\u8054\u5408\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u5728\u975e\u5e73\u7a33\u548c\u9ad8\u566a\u58f0\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u6a21\u578b\u6ee4\u6ce2\u5668\u548c\u65e0\u6a21\u578b\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u8df3\u53d8\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u72b6\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\u9700\u8981\u5df2\u77e5\u566a\u58f0\u7edf\u8ba1\u548c\u6a21\u5f0f\u8f6c\u6362\u52a8\u6001\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u8fd9\u4e9b\u53c2\u6570\u5f80\u5f80\u662f\u672a\u77e5\u7684\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u7f3a\u4e4f\u6a21\u578b\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5728\u590d\u6742\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u6027\u80fd\u53d7\u9650\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u6df7\u5408\u67b6\u6784\uff1a\u4e24\u4e2aRNN\u5206\u522b\u8d1f\u8d23\u6a21\u5f0f\u9884\u6d4b\u548c\u72b6\u6001\u6ee4\u6ce2\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u6ee4\u6ce2\u7f51\u7edc\u57fa\u4e8eKalmanNet\u67b6\u6784\u3002\u91c7\u7528\u4ea4\u66ff\u6700\u5c0f\u4e8c\u4e58\u7b56\u7565\u8fdb\u884c\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u8054\u5408\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u6f5c\u5728\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684\u76d1\u7763\u4fe1\u606f\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u7ebf\u6027\u548c\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u7cfb\u7edf\uff08\u76ee\u6807\u8ddf\u8e2a\u3001\u6446\u89d2\u8ddf\u8e2a\u3001Lorenz\u5438\u5f15\u5b50\u7b49\uff09\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cJMFNet\u5728\u975e\u5e73\u7a33\u548c\u9ad8\u566a\u58f0\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u6a21\u578b\u6ee4\u6ce2\u5668\u548c\u65e0\u6a21\u578b\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u76f8\u6bd4KalmanNet\u6709\u663e\u8457\u6539\u8fdb\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u590d\u6742\u7cfb\u7edf\u6216\u957f\u8f68\u8ff9\u4e2d\u3002", "conclusion": "JMFNet\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u672a\u77e5\u566a\u58f0\u7edf\u8ba1\u548c\u6a21\u5f0f\u8f6c\u6362\u52a8\u6001\u7684\u8df3\u53d8\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u4e00\u81f4\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5bf9\u521d\u59cb\u6761\u4ef6\u3001\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u9009\u62e9\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u77e5\u8bc6\u9519\u8bef\u5177\u6709\u4f4e\u654f\u611f\u6027\u3002"}}

Although distributed training techniques help mitigate these issues, they still suffer from considerable communication overhead. Existing approaches primarily rely on static gradient compression to enhance communication efficiency; however, these methods neglect the dynamic nature of evolving gradients during training, leading to performance degradation. Accelerating LLM training via compression without sacrificing performance remains a challenge. In this paper, we propose an entropy-driven dynamic gradient compression framework called EDGC. The core concept is to adjust the compression rate during LLM training based on the evolving trends of gradient entropy, taking into account both compression efficiency and error. EDGC consists of three key components.First, it employs a down-sampling method to efficiently estimate gradient entropy, reducing computation overhead. Second, it establishes a theoretical model linking compression rate with gradient entropy, enabling more informed compression decisions.

Nonetheless, equivariant methods are often not employed, perhaps because training is perceived to be challenging, or the symmetry is expected to be learned, or equivariant implementations are seen as hard to build. Group averaging is an available technique for these situations. It happens at test time; it can make any trained model precisely equivariant at a (often small) cost proportional to the size of the group; it places no requirements on model structure or training. It is known that, under mild conditions, the group-averaged model will have a provably better prediction accuracy than the original model. Here we show that an inexpensive group averaging can improve accuracy in practice. We take well-established benchmark machine learning models of differential equations in which certain symmetries ought to be obeyed. At evaluation time, we average the models over a small group of symmetries. Our experiments show that this procedure always decreases the average evaluation loss, with improvements of up to 37\\% in terms of the VRMSE. The averaging produces visually better predictions for continuous dynamics. This short paper shows that, under certain common circumstances, there are no disadvantages to imposing exact symmetries; the ML4PS community should consider group averaging as a cheap and simple way to improve model accuracy.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4f7f\u7528\u7fa4\u5e73\u5747\u6280\u672f\u4f7f\u4efb\u4f55\u8bad\u7ec3\u597d\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u5177\u6709\u7cbe\u786e\u7684\u7b49\u53d8\u6027\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u6539\u53d8\u6a21\u578b\u7ed3\u6784\u6216\u8bad\u7ec3\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u9884\u6d4b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u8bb8\u591a\u81ea\u7136\u79d1\u5b66\u4e2d\u7684\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u4efb\u52a1\u9700\u8981\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u7b49\u53d8\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u7b49\u53d8\u65b9\u6cd5\u5e38\u56e0\u8bad\u7ec3\u56f0\u96be\u3001\u671f\u671b\u6a21\u578b\u81ea\u884c\u5b66\u4e60\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u6216\u5b9e\u73b0\u590d\u6742\u800c\u672a\u88ab\u91c7\u7528\u3002\u7fa4\u5e73\u5747\u6280\u672f\u53ef\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e9b\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u5728\u8bc4\u4f30\u65f6\u5bf9\u8bad\u7ec3\u597d\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u5c0f\u89c4\u6a21\u5bf9\u79f0\u7fa4\u7684\u5e73\u5747\u64cd\u4f5c\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u6210\u672c\u4f4e\u4e14\u4e0d\u4f9d\u8d56\u6a21\u578b\u7ed3\u6784\u6216\u8bad\u7ec3\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u7fa4\u5e73\u5747\u59cb\u7ec8\u964d\u4f4e\u8bc4\u4f30\u635f\u5931\uff0cVRMSE\u6307\u6807\u63d0\u5347\u6700\u9ad8\u8fbe37%\uff0c\u5bf9\u8fde\u7eed\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u4ea7\u751f\u89c6\u89c9\u4e0a\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5728\u5e38\u89c1\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u65bd\u52a0\u7cbe\u786e\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u6ca1\u6709\u7f3a\u70b9\uff0c\u7fa4\u5e73\u5747\u662f\u63d0\u9ad8\u6a21\u578b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7684\u5ec9\u4ef7\u7b80\u5355\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0cML4PS\u793e\u533a\u5e94\u8003\u8651\u91c7\u7528\u3002"}}

Jaiman"], "title": "HeatGen: A Guided Diffusion Framework for Multiphysics Heat Sink Design Optimization", "comment": null, "summary": "This study presents a generative optimization framework based on a guided denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM) that leverages surrogate gradients to generate heat sink designs minimizing pressure drop while maintaining surface temperatures below a specified threshold. Geometries are represented using boundary representations of multiple fins, and a multi-fidelity approach is employed to generate training data. Using this dataset, along with vectors representing the boundary representation geometries, we train a denoising diffusion probabilistic model to generate heat sinks with characteristics consistent with those observed in the data. We train two different residual neural networks to predict the pressure drop and surface temperature for each geometry. We use the gradients of these surrogate models with respect to the design variables to guide the geometry generation process toward satisfying the low-pressure and surface temperature constraints. This inference-time guidance directs the generative process toward heat sink designs that not only prevent overheating but also achieve lower pressure drops compared to traditional optimization methods such as CMA-ES. In contrast to traditional black-box optimization approaches, our method is scalable, provided sufficient training data is available. Unlike traditional topology optimization methods, once the model is trained and the heat sink world model is saved, inference under new constraints (e.g., temperature) is computationally inexpensive and does not require retraining. Samples generated using the guided diffusion model achieve pressure drops up to 10 percent lower than the limits obtained by traditional black-box optimization methods.

However, to further cultivate capabilities such as adaptive behavior and long-term decision-making, training on static datasets built from human-level knowledge is insufficient. These datasets are costly to construct and lack both dynamism and realism. A growing consensus is that agents should instead interact directly with environments and learn from experience through reinforcement learning. We formalize this iterative process as the Generation-Execution-Feedback (GEF) loop, where environments generate tasks to challenge agents, return observations in response to agents' actions during task execution, and provide evaluative feedback on rollouts for subsequent learning. Under this paradigm, environments function as indispensable producers of experiential data, highlighting the need to scale them toward greater complexity, realism, and interactivity. In this survey, we systematically review representative methods for environment scaling from a pioneering environment-centric perspective and organize them along the stages of the GEF loop, namely task generation, task execution, and feedback.

However, these models fail to capture circuit runtime behavior, which is crucial for tasks like circuit verification and optimization. To address this limitation, we introduce DR-GNN (DynamicRTL-GNN), a novel approach that learns RTL circuit representations by incorporating both static structures and multi-cycle execution behaviors. DR-GNN leverages an operator-level Control Data Flow Graph (CDFG) to represent Register Transfer Level (RTL) circuits, enabling the model to capture dynamic dependencies and runtime execution.

Although pipeline parallelism alleviates memory pressure by partitioning models across devices, it incurs activation communication overhead that scales linearly with sequence length, limiting efficiency in long-context training. Recent weight-passing approaches (e.g., WeiPipe) mitigate this by transmitting model weights instead of activations, but suffer from redundant peer-to-peer (P2P) transfers and underutilized intra-node bandwidth. We propose TawPipe--topology-aware weight pipeline parallelism, which exploits hierarchical bandwidth in distributed clusters for improved communication efficiency. TawPipe: (i) groups devices based on topology to optimize intra-node collective and inter-node P2P communication; (ii) assigns each device a fixed shard of model weights and gradients, avoiding redundant transfers; and (iii) overlaps communication with computation to hide latency. Unlike global collective operations used in fully sharded data parallelism (FSDP), TawPipe confines most communication within node boundaries, significantly reducing cross-node traffic.

This standard implementation harbors significant computational redundancy, as all heads independently compute attention over the same sequence space. Existing sparse methods, meanwhile, often trade information integrity for computational efficiency. To resolve this efficiency-performance trade-off, we propose SPAttention, whose core contribution is the introduction of a new paradigm we term Principled Structural Sparsity. SPAttention does not merely drop connections but instead reorganizes the computational task by partitioning the total attention workload into balanced, non-overlapping distance bands, assigning each head a unique segment. This approach transforms the multi-head attention mechanism from $H$ independent $O(N^2)$ computations into a single, collaborative $O(N^2)$ computation, fundamentally reducing complexity by a factor of $H$. The structured inductive bias compels functional specialization among heads, enabling a more efficient allocation of computational resources from redundant modeling to distinct dependencies across the entire sequence span. Extensive empirical validation on the OLMoE-1B-7B and 0.25B-1.75B model series demonstrates that while delivering an approximately two-fold increase in training throughput, its performance is on par with standard dense attention, even surpassing it on select key metrics, while consistently outperforming representative sparse attention methods including Longformer, Reformer, and BigBird across all evaluation metrics.", "AI": {"tldr": "SPAttention\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\"\u539f\u5219\u6027\u7ed3\u6784\u7a00\u758f\u6027\"\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u5c06\u591a\u5934\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u8ba1\u7b97\u4eceH\u4e2a\u72ec\u7acb\u7684O(N\u00b2)\u8ba1\u7b97\u8f6c\u53d8\u4e3a\u5355\u4e2a\u534f\u4f5c\u7684O(N\u00b2)\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u5c06\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u964d\u4f4eH\u500d\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u7ea6\u4e24\u500d\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3LLM\u6838\u5fc3\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u4e2d\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u5ea6O(H\u00b7N\u00b2)\u4e0e\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6839\u672c\u51b2\u7a81\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u7a00\u758f\u65b9\u6cd5\u5f80\u5f80\u727a\u7272\u4fe1\u606f\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\u6362\u53d6\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u603b\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5de5\u4f5c\u8d1f\u8f7d\u5212\u5206\u4e3a\u5e73\u8861\u3001\u975e\u91cd\u53e0\u7684\u8ddd\u79bb\u5e26\uff0c\u4e3a\u6bcf\u4e2a\u5934\u5206\u914d\u552f\u4e00\u7247\u6bb5\uff0c\u5f3a\u5236\u5934\u95f4\u529f\u80fd\u4e13\u4e1a\u5316\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\u4ece\u5197\u4f59\u5efa\u6a21\u5230\u8de8\u5e8f\u5217\u8de8\u5ea6\u4e0d\u540c\u4f9d\u8d56\u7684\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u5206\u914d\u3002", "result": "\u5728OLMoE-1B-7B\u548c0.25B-1.75B\u6a21\u578b\u7cfb\u5217\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u63d0\u5347\u7ea6\u4e24\u500d\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u6807\u51c6\u5bc6\u96c6\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u76f8\u5f53\u751a\u81f3\u5728\u67d0\u4e9b\u5173\u952e\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u8d85\u8d8a\uff0c\u5728\u6240\u6709\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u4e00\u81f4\u4f18\u4e8eLongformer\u3001Reformer\u548cBigBird\u7b49\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u7a00\u758f\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "SPAttention\u901a\u8fc7\u539f\u5219\u6027\u7ed3\u6784\u7a00\u758f\u6027\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u6548\u7387-\u6027\u80fd\u6743\u8861\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3aLLM\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

Data heterogeneity across silos, however, presents a major challenge undermining the convergence speed and accuracy of the global model. This paper introduces Step-wise Momentum Fusion (SMoFi), an effective and lightweight framework that counteracts gradient divergence arising from data heterogeneity by synchronizing the momentum buffers across server-side optimizers. To control gradient divergence over the training process, we design a staleness-aware alignment mechanism that imposes constraints on gradient updates of the server-side submodel at each optimization step. Extensive validations on multiple real-world datasets show that SMoFi consistently improves global model accuracy (up to 7.1%) and convergence speed (up to 10.25$\\times$). Furthermore, SMoFi has a greater impact with more clients involved and deeper learning models, making it particularly suitable for model training in resource-constrained contexts.", "AI": {"tldr": "SMoFi\u901a\u8fc7\u540c\u6b65\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u7aef\u4f18\u5316\u5668\u7684\u52a8\u91cf\u7f13\u51b2\u533a\u6765\u5e94\u5bf9\u6570\u636e\u5f02\u6784\u6027\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u68af\u5ea6\u53d1\u6563\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u9648\u65e7\u611f\u77e5\u5bf9\u9f50\u673a\u5236\u6765\u63a7\u5236\u8bad\u7ec3\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u68af\u5ea6\u53d1\u6563\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5168\u5c40\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u6536\u655b\u901f\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u6570\u636e\u5f02\u6784\u6027\u5bf9\u5168\u5c40\u6a21\u578b\u6536\u655b\u901f\u5ea6\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faStep-wise Momentum Fusion (SMoFi)\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u540c\u6b65\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u7aef\u4f18\u5316\u5668\u7684\u52a8\u91cf\u7f13\u51b2\u533a\uff0c\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u9648\u65e7\u611f\u77e5\u5bf9\u9f50\u673a\u5236\u6765\u63a7\u5236\u68af\u5ea6\u66f4\u65b0\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u9a8c\u8bc1\u663e\u793a\uff0cSMoFi\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u5168\u5c40\u6a21\u578b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u8fbe7.1%\uff0c\u6536\u655b\u901f\u5ea6\u63d0\u5347\u8fbe10.25\u500d\uff0c\u5728\u66f4\u591a\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u548c\u66f4\u6df1\u6a21\u578b\u65f6\u6548\u679c\u66f4\u663e\u8457\u3002", "conclusion": "SMoFi\u662f\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u4e14\u6709\u6548\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u5e94\u5bf9\u6570\u636e\u5f02\u6784\u6027\u6311\u6218\u3002"}}

This gives rise to parametric expensive multi-objective optimization problems (P-EMOPs) where each task parameter defines a distinct optimization instance. Current multi-objective Bayesian optimization methods have been widely used for finding finite sets of Pareto optimal solutions for individual tasks. However, P-EMOPs present a fundamental challenge: the continuous task parameter space can contain infinite distinct problems, each requiring separate expensive evaluations. This demands learning an inverse model that can directly predict optimized solutions for any task-preference query without expensive re-evaluation. This paper introduces the first parametric multi-objective Bayesian optimizer that learns this inverse model by alternating between (1) acquisition-driven search leveraging inter-task synergies and (2) generative solution sampling via conditional generative models. This approach enables efficient optimization across related tasks and finally achieves direct solution prediction for unseen parameterized EMOPs without additional expensive evaluations. We theoretically justify the faster convergence by leveraging inter-task synergies through task-aware Gaussian processes. Meanwhile, empirical studies in synthetic and real-world benchmarks further verify the effectiveness of our alternating framework.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u9996\u4e2a\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u4f18\u5316\u5668\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4ea4\u66ff\u8fdb\u884c\u83b7\u53d6\u9a71\u52a8\u641c\u7d22\u548c\u751f\u6210\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u91c7\u6837\uff0c\u5b66\u4e60\u9006\u6a21\u578b\u4ee5\u76f4\u63a5\u9884\u6d4b\u4efb\u4f55\u4efb\u52a1\u504f\u597d\u67e5\u8be2\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u89e3\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u6602\u8d35\u91cd\u65b0\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u5b9e\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u9700\u8981\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u64cd\u4f5c\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u89e3\u51b3\u6602\u8d35\u7684\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u65cf\uff0c\u8fd9\u4ea7\u751f\u4e86\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u6602\u8d35\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898(P-EMOPs)\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u6bcf\u4e2a\u4efb\u52a1\u53c2\u6570\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e00\u4e2a\u72ec\u7279\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u5b9e\u4f8b\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u65e0\u6cd5\u5904\u7406\u8fde\u7eed\u4efb\u52a1\u53c2\u6570\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u7684\u65e0\u9650\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u4ea4\u66ff\u8fdb\u884c\uff1a(1)\u5229\u7528\u4efb\u52a1\u95f4\u534f\u540c\u6548\u5e94\u7684\u83b7\u53d6\u9a71\u52a8\u641c\u7d22\uff0c(2)\u901a\u8fc7\u6761\u4ef6\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u751f\u6210\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u91c7\u6837\u3002\u4f7f\u7528\u4efb\u52a1\u611f\u77e5\u9ad8\u65af\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7406\u8bba\u8bc1\u660e\u66f4\u5feb\u6536\u655b\u3002", "result": "\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u901a\u8fc7\u4efb\u52a1\u95f4\u534f\u540c\u6548\u5e94\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u5feb\u6536\u655b\uff0c\u5408\u6210\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u4ea4\u66ff\u6846\u67b6\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u8de8\u76f8\u5173\u4efb\u52a1\u8fdb\u884c\u9ad8\u6548\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u6700\u7ec8\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9\u672a\u89c1\u53c2\u6570\u5316EMOPs\u7684\u76f4\u63a5\u89e3\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u989d\u5916\u6602\u8d35\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002"}}

However, the distributed nature of real-world traffic data across multiple stakeholders poses significant challenges in modeling and reconstructing inter-client spatial dependencies while adhering to data locality constraints. Existing methods primarily address static dependencies, overlooking their dynamic nature and resulting in suboptimal performance. In response, we propose Federated Spatio-Temporal Graph with Dynamic Inter-Client Dependencies (FedSTGD), a framework designed to model and reconstruct dynamic inter-client spatial dependencies in federated learning. FedSTGD incorporates a federated nonlinear computation decomposition module to approximate complex graph operations. This is complemented by a graph node embedding augmentation module, which alleviates performance degradation arising from the decomposition. These modules are coordinated through a client-server collective learning protocol, which decomposes dynamic inter-client spatial dependency learning tasks into lightweight, parallelizable subtasks. Extensive experiments on four real-world datasets demonstrate that FedSTGD achieves superior performance over state-of-the-art baselines in terms of RMSE, MAE, and MAPE, approaching that of centralized baselines. Ablation studies confirm the contribution of each module in addressing dynamic inter-client spatial dependencies, while sensitivity analysis highlights the robustness of FedSTGD to variations in hyperparameters.", "AI": {"tldr": "FedSTGD\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u8054\u90a6\u65f6\u7a7a\u56fe\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5728\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u5efa\u6a21\u548c\u91cd\u6784\u52a8\u6001\u7684\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u95f4\u7a7a\u95f4\u4f9d\u8d56\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u8ba1\u7b97\u5206\u89e3\u548c\u8282\u70b9\u5d4c\u5165\u589e\u5f3a\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u62a4\u6570\u636e\u9690\u79c1\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u63a5\u8fd1\u96c6\u4e2d\u5f0f\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u4ea4\u901a\u6570\u636e\u5206\u5e03\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u5229\u76ca\u76f8\u5173\u65b9\u4e4b\u95f4\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3b\u8981\u5904\u7406\u9759\u6001\u4f9d\u8d56\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u5ffd\u89c6\u4e86\u52a8\u6001\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6027\u80fd\u4e0d\u4f73\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u5728\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u5904\u7406\u52a8\u6001\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u95f4\u7a7a\u95f4\u4f9d\u8d56\u5173\u7cfb\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "FedSTGD\u5305\u542b\u8054\u90a6\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u8ba1\u7b97\u5206\u89e3\u6a21\u5757\u6765\u8fd1\u4f3c\u590d\u6742\u56fe\u64cd\u4f5c\uff0c\u56fe\u8282\u70b9\u5d4c\u5165\u589e\u5f3a\u6a21\u5757\u7f13\u89e3\u5206\u89e3\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef-\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u96c6\u4f53\u5b66\u4e60\u534f\u8bae\u5c06\u52a8\u6001\u4f9d\u8d56\u5b66\u4e60\u4efb\u52a1\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u5e76\u884c\u5b50\u4efb\u52a1\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u56db\u4e2a\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cFedSTGD\u5728RMSE\u3001MAE\u548cMAPE\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u63a5\u8fd1\u96c6\u4e2d\u5f0f\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002\u6d88\u878d\u7814\u7a76\u786e\u8ba4\u4e86\u5404\u6a21\u5757\u5bf9\u5904\u7406\u52a8\u6001\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u95f4\u7a7a\u95f4\u4f9d\u8d56\u7684\u8d21\u732e\u3002", "conclusion": "FedSTGD\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u5efa\u6a21\u52a8\u6001\u7684\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u95f4\u7a7a\u95f4\u4f9d\u8d56\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u5728\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5bf9\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u53d8\u5316\u5177\u6709\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u4ea4\u901a\u6570\u636e\u5efa\u6a21\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

However, the classical foundations of RL do not account for the risk sensitivity of the objective function, which is critical in various fields, including healthcare and finance. A popular approach to incorporate risk sensitivity is to optimize a specific quantile of the cumulative reward distribution. In this paper, we develop UCB-QRL, an optimistic learning algorithm for the $\u03c4$-quantile objective in finite-horizon Markov decision processes (MDPs). UCB-QRL is an iterative algorithm in which, at each iteration, we first estimate the underlying transition probability and then optimize the quantile value function over a confidence ball around this estimate. We show that UCB-QRL yields a high-probability regret bound $\\mathcal O\\left((2/\u03ba)^{H+1}H\\sqrt{SATH\\log(2SATH/\u03b4)}\\right)$ in the episodic setting with $S$ states, $A$ actions, $T$ episodes, and $H$ horizons.

We find that simple self-supervised pre-training on just a \\emph{single} real table can produce surprisingly strong transfer across heterogeneous benchmarks.

These approaches iteratively measure low-order noisy marginals and fit graphical models to produce synthetic data, enabling systematic optimisation of data quality under privacy constraints. Graphical models, however, are inefficient for high-dimensional data because they require substantial memory and must be retrained from scratch whenever the graph structure changes, leading to significant computational overhead. Recent methods, like GEM, overcome these limitations by using generator neural networks for improved scalability. However, empirical comparisons have mostly focused on small datasets, limiting real-world applicability. In this work, we introduce GEM+, which integrates AIM's adaptive measurement framework with GEM's scalable generator network.

We address this imbalance with Boosted GFlowNets, a method that sequentially trains an ensemble of GFlowNets, each optimizing a residual reward that compensates for the mass already captured by previous models. This residual principle reactivates learning signals in underexplored regions and, under mild assumptions, ensures a monotone non-degradation property: adding boosters cannot worsen the learned distribution and typically improves it.

Most existing black-box attacks focus on vector-based or discrete-action RL, and their effectiveness on image-based continuous control is limited by the large action space and excessive environment queries. We propose SEBA, a sample-efficient framework for black-box adversarial attacks on visual RL agents. SEBA integrates a shadow Q model that estimates cumulative rewards under adversarial conditions, a generative adversarial network that produces visually imperceptible perturbations, and a world model that simulates environment dynamics to reduce real-world queries. Through a two-stage iterative training procedure that alternates between learning the shadow model and refining the generator, SEBA achieves strong attack performance while maintaining efficiency. Experiments on MuJoCo and Atari benchmarks show that SEBA significantly reduces cumulative rewards, preserves visual fidelity, and greatly decreases environment interactions compared to prior black-box and white-box methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "SEBA\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u9488\u5bf9\u89c6\u89c9\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u9ed1\u76d2\u5bf9\u6297\u653b\u51fb\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u96c6\u6210\u5f71\u5b50Q\u6a21\u578b\u3001\u751f\u6210\u5bf9\u6297\u7f51\u7edc\u548c\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u89c6\u89c9\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u6709\u6548\u964d\u4f4e\u7d2f\u79ef\u5956\u52b1\uff0c\u5e76\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u73af\u5883\u4ea4\u4e92\u6b21\u6570\u3002", "motivation": "\u89c6\u89c9\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u89c6\u89c9\u63a7\u5236\u548c\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u9886\u57df\u53d6\u5f97\u663e\u8457\u8fdb\u5c55\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u5bf9\u6297\u6270\u52a8\u7684\u8106\u5f31\u6027\u5c1a\u672a\u5145\u5206\u63a2\u7d22\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u9ed1\u76d2\u653b\u51fb\u4e3b\u8981\u9488\u5bf9\u57fa\u4e8e\u5411\u91cf\u6216\u79bb\u6563\u52a8\u4f5c\u7684RL\uff0c\u5728\u56fe\u50cf\u8fde\u7eed\u63a7\u5236\u4e2d\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u5927\u52a8\u4f5c\u7a7a\u95f4\u548c\u8fc7\u591a\u73af\u5883\u67e5\u8be2\u3002", "method": "SEBA\u96c6\u6210\u5f71\u5b50Q\u6a21\u578b\u4f30\u8ba1\u5bf9\u6297\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u7d2f\u79ef\u5956\u52b1\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u751f\u6210\u5bf9\u6297\u7f51\u7edc\u4ea7\u751f\u89c6\u89c9\u4e0d\u53ef\u5bdf\u89c9\u7684\u6270\u52a8\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u6a21\u62df\u73af\u5883\u52a8\u6001\u4ee5\u51cf\u5c11\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u67e5\u8be2\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u8fed\u4ee3\u8bad\u7ec3\u7a0b\u5e8f\uff0c\u4ea4\u66ff\u5b66\u4e60\u5f71\u5b50\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u4f18\u5316\u751f\u6210\u5668\u3002", "result": "\u5728MuJoCo\u548cAtari\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cSEBA\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u7d2f\u79ef\u5956\u52b1\uff0c\u4fdd\u6301\u89c6\u89c9\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\uff0c\u5e76\u5927\u5e45\u51cf\u5c11\u73af\u5883\u4ea4\u4e92\u6b21\u6570\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u5148\u524d\u7684\u9ed1\u76d2\u548c\u767d\u76d2\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "SEBA\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u9ed1\u76d2\u5bf9\u6297\u653b\u51fb\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u89c6\u89c9\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u653b\u51fb\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u6837\u672c\u6548\u7387\u548c\u89c6\u89c9\u8d28\u91cf\u3002"}}

Originally proposed as a generalization of the binary spatter code model, it aims to provide higher representational power while remaining a lighter alternative to models requiring high-precision components. Despite this potential, MCR has received limited attention. Systematic analyses of its trade-offs and comparisons with other models are lacking, sustaining the perception that its added complexity outweighs the improved expressivity. In this work, we revisit MCR by presenting its first extensive evaluation, demonstrating that it achieves a unique balance of capacity, accuracy, and hardware efficiency. Experiments measuring capacity demonstrate that MCR outperforms binary and integer vectors while approaching complex-valued representations at a fraction of their memory footprint. Evaluation on 123 datasets confirms consistent accuracy gains and shows that MCR can match the performance of binary spatter codes using up to 4x less memory. We investigate the hardware realization of MCR by showing that it maps naturally to digital logic and by designing the first dedicated accelerator. Evaluations on basic operations and 7 selected datasets demonstrate a speedup of up to 3 orders of magnitude and significant energy reductions compared to software implementation. When matched for accuracy against binary spatter codes, MCR achieves on average 3.08x faster execution and 2.68x lower energy consumption. These findings demonstrate that, although MCR requires more sophisticated operations than binary spatter codes, its modular arithmetic and higher per-component precision enable lower dimensionality. When realized with dedicated hardware, this results in a faster, more energy-efficient, and high-precision alternative to existing models.", "AI": {"tldr": "MCR\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u4f7f\u7528\u6a21\u8fd0\u7b97\u7684\u9ad8\u7ef4\u6574\u6570\u5411\u91cf\u8ba1\u7b97\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5728\u5bb9\u91cf\u3001\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u786c\u4ef6\u6548\u7387\u65b9\u9762\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u72ec\u7279\u5e73\u8861\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u4e8c\u8fdb\u5236\u5411\u91cf\u6027\u80fd\u66f4\u4f18\uff0c\u5185\u5b58\u5360\u7528\u66f4\u5c11\uff0c\u786c\u4ef6\u52a0\u901f\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b03\u4e2a\u6570\u91cf\u7ea7\u7684\u901f\u5ea6\u63d0\u5347\u548c\u663e\u8457\u80fd\u8017\u964d\u4f4e\u3002", "motivation": "MCR\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e8c\u8fdb\u5236\u6563\u70b9\u7801\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u8868\u793a\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u4e4b\u524d\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7cfb\u7edf\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u5176\u590d\u6742\u6027\u88ab\u8ba4\u4e3a\u8d85\u8fc7\u4e86\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\u63d0\u5347\u7684\u4ef7\u503c\u3002", "method": "\u5bf9MCR\u8fdb\u884c\u9996\u6b21\u5168\u9762\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u5bb9\u91cf\u6d4b\u91cf\u3001123\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u8bbe\u8ba1\u9996\u4e2a\u4e13\u7528\u786c\u4ef6\u52a0\u901f\u5668\u6765\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u786c\u4ef6\u5b9e\u73b0\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "result": "MCR\u5728\u5bb9\u91cf\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u4e8c\u8fdb\u5236\u548c\u6574\u6570\u5411\u91cf\uff0c\u63a5\u8fd1\u590d\u6570\u8868\u793a\u4f46\u5185\u5b58\u5360\u7528\u66f4\u5c11\uff1b\u5728123\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u663e\u793a\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u7cbe\u5ea6\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u5185\u5b58\u4f7f\u7528\u6bd4\u4e8c\u8fdb\u5236\u6563\u70b9\u7801\u51cf\u5c114\u500d\uff1b\u786c\u4ef6\u52a0\u901f\u5b9e\u73b03\u4e2a\u6570\u91cf\u7ea7\u901f\u5ea6\u63d0\u5347\u548c\u663e\u8457\u80fd\u8017\u964d\u4f4e\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5c3d\u7ba1MCR\u9700\u8981\u6bd4\u4e8c\u8fdb\u5236\u6563\u70b9\u7801\u66f4\u590d\u6742\u7684\u64cd\u4f5c\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u6a21\u8fd0\u7b97\u548c\u66f4\u9ad8\u7ec4\u4ef6\u7cbe\u5ea6\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u4f4e\u7ef4\u5ea6\uff0c\u5728\u4e13\u7528\u786c\u4ef6\u4e0a\u6210\u4e3a\u66f4\u5feb\u3001\u66f4\u8282\u80fd\u3001\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

While deep learning has substantially advanced this field, two challenges remain fundamental: the uncertainty of atmospheric dynamics and the efficient modeling of high-dimensional data. Diffusion models have shown strong promise by producing sharp, reliable forecasts, but their iterative sampling process is computationally prohibitive for time-critical applications. We introduce FlowCast, the first model to apply Conditional Flow Matching (CFM) to precipitation nowcasting. Unlike diffusion, CFM learns a direct noise-to-data mapping, enabling rapid, high-fidelity sample generation with drastically fewer function evaluations. Our experiments demonstrate that FlowCast establishes a new state-of-the-art in predictive accuracy. A direct comparison further reveals the CFM objective is both more accurate and significantly more efficient than a diffusion objective on the same architecture, maintaining high performance with significantly fewer sampling steps.

Part-1 is trained locally at each client and aggregated by the aggregator at the end of each round. Part-2 is trained at a server that sequentially processes the intermediate activations received from each client. We study the phenomenon of catastrophic forgetting (CF) in SFL in the presence of data heterogeneity. In detail, due to the nature of SFL, local updates of part-1 may drift away from global optima, while part-2 is sensitive to the processing sequence, similar to forgetting in continual learning (CL). Specifically, we observe that the trained model performs better in classes (labels) seen at the end of the sequence. We investigate this phenomenon with emphasis on key aspects of SFL, such as the processing order at the server and the cut layer.

In this work, we focus on contextual reinforcement learning, where agents act within environments with varying contexts, such as self-driving cars or quadrupedal robots that need to operate in different terrains or weather conditions than they were trained for. We tackle the critical task of generalizing to out-of-distribution (OOD) settings, without access to explicit context information at test time. Recent work has addressed this problem by training a context encoder and a history adaptation module in separate stages. While promising, this two-phase approach is cumbersome to implement and train.

Conventional multimodal approaches that simply fuse numerical indicators and textual sentiment rarely adapt to such shifts. We introduce macro-contextual retrieval, a retrieval-augmented forecasting framework that grounds each prediction in historically analogous macroeconomic regimes. The method jointly embeds macro indicators (e.g., CPI, unemployment, yield spread, GDP growth) and financial news sentiment in a shared similarity space, enabling causal retrieval of precedent periods during inference without retraining.\n  Trained on seventeen years of S&P 500 data (2007-2023) and evaluated OOD on AAPL (2024) and XOM (2024), the framework consistently narrows the CV to OOD performance gap. Macro-conditioned retrieval achieves the only positive out-of-sample trading outcomes (AAPL: PF=1.18, Sharpe=0.95; XOM: PF=1.16, Sharpe=0.61), while static numeric, text-only, and naive multimodal baselines collapse under regime shifts. Beyond metric gains, retrieved neighbors form interpretable evidence chains that correspond to recognizable macro contexts, such as inflationary or yield-curve inversion phases, supporting causal interpretability and transparency. By operationalizing the principle that \"financial history may not repeat, but it often rhymes,\" this work demonstrates that macro-aware retrieval yields robust, explainable forecasts under distributional change.\n  All datasets, models, and source code are publicly available.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u5b8f\u89c2\u7ecf\u6d4e\u60c5\u5883\u68c0\u7d22\u7684\u91d1\u878d\u9884\u6d4b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u68c0\u7d22\u5386\u53f2\u4e0a\u76f8\u4f3c\u7684\u5b8f\u89c2\u7ecf\u6d4e\u73af\u5883\u6765\u589e\u5f3a\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u7a33\u5065\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u5206\u5e03\u5916\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u91d1\u878d\u5e02\u573a\u5177\u6709\u975e\u5e73\u7a33\u6027\uff0c\u7ed3\u6784\u6027\u65ad\u88c2\u548c\u5b8f\u89c2\u7ecf\u6d4e\u4f53\u5236\u8f6c\u6362\u5bfc\u81f4\u4f20\u7edf\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5206\u5e03\u5916\u90e8\u7f72\u65f6\u5931\u6548\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u878d\u5408\u6570\u503c\u6307\u6807\u548c\u6587\u672c\u60c5\u611f\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u9002\u5e94\u8fd9\u79cd\u53d8\u5316\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u5b8f\u89c2\u60c5\u5883\u68c0\u7d22\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5728\u5171\u4eab\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u8054\u5408\u5d4c\u5165\u5b8f\u89c2\u6307\u6807\uff08CPI\u3001\u5931\u4e1a\u7387\u3001\u6536\u76ca\u7387\u5229\u5dee\u3001GDP\u589e\u957f\u7b49\uff09\u548c\u91d1\u878d\u65b0\u95fb\u60c5\u611f\uff0c\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u65e0\u9700\u91cd\u65b0\u8bad\u7ec3\u5373\u53ef\u56e0\u679c\u68c0\u7d22\u5386\u53f2\u76f8\u4f3c\u65f6\u671f\u3002", "result": "\u572817\u5e74\u6807\u666e500\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u5728AAPL\u548cXOM\u76842024\u5e74\u5206\u5e03\u5916\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u663e\u8457\u7f29\u5c0f\u4e86CV\u5230OOD\u6027\u80fd\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u552f\u4e00\u6b63\u7684\u6837\u672c\u5916\u4ea4\u6613\u7ed3\u679c\uff08AAPL\uff1aPF=1.18\uff0cSharpe=0.95\uff1bXOM\uff1aPF=1.16\uff0cSharpe=0.61\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u65bd\"\u91d1\u878d\u5386\u53f2\u4e0d\u4f1a\u91cd\u6f14\u4f46\u4f1a\u62bc\u97f5\"\u7684\u539f\u5219\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u57fa\u4e8e\u5b8f\u89c2\u610f\u8bc6\u7684\u68c0\u7d22\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u5206\u5e03\u53d8\u5316\u4e0b\u4ea7\u751f\u7a33\u5065\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u68c0\u7d22\u5230\u7684\u90bb\u5c45\u5f62\u6210\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u8bc1\u636e\u94fe\uff0c\u5bf9\u5e94\u53ef\u8bc6\u522b\u7684\u5b8f\u89c2\u60c5\u5883\u3002"}}

Our main results highlight a dramatic difference between these two settings: For distribution-independent learning, we prove a strong equivalence between the two noise models: If a class ${\\cal C}$ of functions is efficiently learnable in the presence of $\u03b7$-rate malicious noise, then it is also efficiently learnable in the presence of $\u03b7$-rate nasty noise. In sharp contrast, for the fixed-distribution setting we show an arbitrarily large separation: Under a standard cryptographic assumption, for any arbitrarily large value $r$ there exists a concept class for which there is a ratio of $r$ between the rate $\u03b7_{malicious}$ of malicious noise that polynomial-time learning algorithms can tolerate, versus the rate $\u03b7_{nasty}$ of nasty noise that such learning algorithms can tolerate.\n  To offset the negative result for the fixed-distribution setting, we define a broad and natural class of algorithms, namely those that ignore contradictory examples (ICE). We show that for these algorithms, malicious noise and nasty noise are equivalent up to a factor of two in the noise rate: Any efficient ICE learner that succeeds with $\u03b7$-rate malicious noise can be converted to an efficient learner that succeeds with $\u03b7/2$-rate nasty noise.

Modality-specific embeddings from EEG and EOG channels are fused via a Graph Convolutional Network, facilitating robust multimodal integration. NeuroLingua is evaluated on the Sleep-EDF Expanded and ISRUC-Sleep datasets, achieving state-of-the-art results on Sleep-EDF (85.3% accuracy, 0.800 macro F1, and 0.796 Cohen's kappa) and competitive performance on ISRUC (81.9% accuracy, 0.802 macro F1, and 0.755 kappa), matching or exceeding published baselines in overall and per-class metrics.

In GRPO, prompts are answered by the model and, through reinforcement learning, preferred completions are learnt. Owing to the small communication volume, GRPO is inherently suitable for decentralised training as the prompts can be concurrently answered by multiple nodes and then exchanged in the forms of strings. In this work, we present the first adversarial attack in decentralised GRPO. We demonstrate that malicious parties can poison such systems by injecting arbitrary malicious tokens in benign models in both out-of-context and in-context attacks. Using empirical examples of math and coding tasks, we show that adversarial attacks can easily poison the benign nodes, polluting their local LLM post-training, achieving attack success rates up to 100% in as few as 50 iterations. We propose two ways to defend against these attacks, depending on whether all users train the same model or different models. We show that these defenses can achieve stop rates of up to 100%, making the attack impossible.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u9488\u5bf9\u53bb\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316GRPO\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u9996\u4e2a\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u653b\u51fb\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u6076\u610f\u65b9\u53ef\u4ee5\u901a\u8fc7\u6ce8\u5165\u6076\u610ftoken\u6765\u6bd2\u5316\u826f\u6027\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u653b\u51fb\u6210\u529f\u7387\u53ef\u8fbe100%\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e24\u79cd\u9632\u5fa1\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "GRPO\u5728LLM\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u5e94\u7528\u5e7f\u6cdb\uff0c\u5176\u53bb\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316\u7279\u6027\u867d\u7136\u9002\u5408\u591a\u8282\u70b9\u5e76\u53d1\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u4f46\u4e5f\u4e3a\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u653b\u51fb\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u4e58\u4e4b\u673a\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u7814\u7a76\u76f8\u5e94\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u5a01\u80c1\u548c\u9632\u5fa1\u63aa\u65bd\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u53bb\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316GRPO\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u6ce8\u5165\u4efb\u610f\u6076\u610ftoken\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5185\u548c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5916\u653b\u51fb\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u6570\u5b66\u548c\u7f16\u7a0b\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u5b9e\u8bc1\u4f8b\u5b50\u9a8c\u8bc1\u653b\u51fb\u6548\u679c\u3002", "result": "\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u653b\u51fb\u53ef\u4ee5\u8f7b\u677e\u6bd2\u5316\u826f\u6027\u8282\u70b9\uff0c\u6c61\u67d3\u5176\u672c\u5730LLM\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u5728\u4ec550\u6b21\u8fed\u4ee3\u5185\u653b\u51fb\u6210\u529f\u7387\u53ef\u8fbe100%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e24\u79cd\u9632\u5fa1\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u9488\u5bf9\u76f8\u540c\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u573a\u666f\uff09\uff0c\u9632\u5fa1\u6210\u529f\u7387\u53ef\u8fbe100%\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u963b\u6b62\u6b64\u7c7b\u653b\u51fb\u3002"}}

We propose a novel theoretical explanation for this phenomenon, hypothesizing that JEPA's predictive objective implicitly drives it to learn the invariant subspace of the system's Koopman operator. We prove that an idealized JEPA loss is minimized when the encoder represents the system's regime indicator functions, which are Koopman eigenfunctions. This theory was validated on synthetic data with known dynamics, demonstrating that constraining the JEPA's linear predictor to be a near-identity operator is the key inductive bias that forces the encoder to learn these invariants. We further discuss that this constraint is critical for selecting this interpretable solution from a class of mathematically equivalent but entangled optima, revealing the predictor's role in representation disentanglement.

The dual-stream design provides more interpretable predictions by disentangling macro-level trends from micro-level deviations in the target variable. To enable effective learning in output prediction, deviation estimation, and trend classification, we design a multi-task loss with uncertainty-aware weighting to adaptively balance the contribution of each task.

In real-world problems, the best arm needs to satisfy additional feasibility constraints. While there is limited prior work on BAI with feasibility constraints, they typically assume the performance and constraints are observed simultaneously on each pull of an arm. However, this assumption does not reflect most practical use cases, e.g., in drug discovery, we wish to find the most potent drug whose toxicity and solubility are below certain safety thresholds. These safety experiments can be conducted separately from the potency measurement. Thus, this requires designing BAI algorithms that not only decide which arm to pull but also decide whether to test for the arm's performance or feasibility. In this work, we study feasible BAI which allows a decision-maker to choose a tuple $(i,\\ell)$, where $i\\in [K]$ denotes an arm and $\\ell$ denotes whether she wishes to test for its performance ($\\ell=0$) or any of its $N$ feasibility constraints ($\\ell\\in[N]$). We focus on the fixed confidence setting, which is to identify the \\textit{feasible} arm with the \\textit{highest performance}, with a probability of at least $1-\u03b4$.

We analyze the gradient flow associated with overparameterized optimization problems, which can be interpreted as training a neural network with linear activations. Remarkably, we show that the global convergence properties can be derived for any cost function that is proper and real analytic. We then specialize the analysis to scalar-valued cost functions, where the geometry of the landscape can be fully characterized. In this setting, we demonstrate that key structural features -- such as the location and stability of saddle points -- are universal across all admissible costs, depending solely on the overparameterized representation rather than on problem-specific details. Moreover, we show that convergence can be arbitrarily accelerated depending on the initialization, as measured by an imbalance metric introduced in this work. Finally, we discuss how these insights may generalize to neural networks with sigmoidal activations, showing through a simple example which geometric and dynamical properties persist beyond the linear case.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u7ec4\u5408\u7ed3\u6784\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u4f18\u5316\u666f\u89c2\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\u52a8\u6001\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u8fc7\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u68af\u5ea6\u6d41\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5728\u9002\u5f53\u5b9e\u89e3\u6790\u6210\u672c\u51fd\u6570\u4e0b\u7684\u5168\u5c40\u6536\u655b\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5728\u6807\u91cf\u503c\u6210\u672c\u51fd\u6570\u4e2d\u666f\u89c2\u51e0\u4f55\u7684\u901a\u7528\u6027\u7279\u5f81\u3002", "motivation": "\u7406\u89e3\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u7ec4\u5408\u7ed3\u6784\u5bf9\u4f18\u5316\u666f\u89c2\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\u52a8\u6001\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u8fc7\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u8868\u793a\u5982\u4f55\u51b3\u5b9a\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u800c\u4e0d\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u5177\u4f53\u95ee\u9898\u7ec6\u8282\u3002", "method": "\u5206\u6790\u8fc7\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u68af\u5ea6\u6d41\uff0c\u5c06\u5176\u89e3\u91ca\u4e3a\u5177\u6709\u7ebf\u6027\u6fc0\u6d3b\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u63a8\u5bfc\u5168\u5c40\u6536\u655b\u6027\u8d28\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u5ea6\u91cf\u6765\u91cf\u5316\u6536\u655b\u52a0\u901f\u3002", "result": "\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5728\u9002\u5f53\u5b9e\u89e3\u6790\u6210\u672c\u51fd\u6570\u4e0b\u7684\u5168\u5c40\u6536\u655b\u6027\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u978d\u70b9\u4f4d\u7f6e\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u7b49\u7ed3\u6784\u7279\u5f81\u5728\u6240\u6709\u5141\u8bb8\u6210\u672c\u51fd\u6570\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u901a\u7528\u6027\uff0c\u6536\u655b\u901f\u5ea6\u53ef\u6839\u636e\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u4efb\u610f\u52a0\u901f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u7ec4\u5408\u7ed3\u6784\u51b3\u5b9a\u4e86\u4f18\u5316\u666f\u89c2\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u89c1\u89e3\u53ef\u80fd\u63a8\u5e7f\u5230\u5177\u6709sigmoid\u6fc0\u6d3b\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u8d85\u8d8a\u7ebf\u6027\u60c5\u51b5\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u7279\u6027\u3002"}}

Even for just two halfspaces, it remains a major open question whether learning is possible in polynomial time with respect to the margin $\u03b3$ of the data points and their dimensionality $d$. The best-known algorithms run in quasi-polynomial time $d^{O(\\log(1/\u03b3))}$, and it has been shown that this complexity is unavoidable for any algorithm relying solely on correlational statistical queries (CSQ).\n  In this work, we introduce a novel algorithm that provably circumvents the CSQ hardness barrier. Our approach applies to a broad class of distributions satisfying a natural, previously studied, factorizability assumption. Factorizable distributions lie between distribution-specific and distribution-free settings, and significantly extend previously known tractable cases. Under these distributions, we show that CSQ-based methods still require quasipolynomial time even for weakly learning, whereas our algorithm achieves $poly(d,1/\u03b3)$ time by leveraging more general statistical queries (SQ), establishing a strong separation between CSQ and SQ for this simple realizable PAC learning problem.\n  Our result is grounded in a rigorous analysis utilizing a novel duality framework that characterizes the moment tensor structure induced by the marginal distributions. Building on these structural insights, we propose new, efficient learning algorithms.

Recent work explores using large language models (LLMs) for annotation, but LLM-generated labels still fall short of human-level quality. To address this problem, we propose the Annotation with Critical Thinking (ACT) data pipeline, where LLMs serve not only as annotators but also as judges to critically identify potential errors. Human effort is then directed towards reviewing only the most \"suspicious\" cases, significantly improving the human annotation efficiency. Our major contributions are as follows: (1) ACT is applicable to a wide range of domains, including natural language processing (NLP), computer vision (CV), and multimodal understanding, by leveraging multimodal-LLMs (MLLMs).

However, a static model trained on a single dataset fails to adapt to the dynamically evolving clinical environment and continuous data streams, limiting its practical utility. While continual learning (CL) offers a solution to learn dynamically from new datasets, existing CL methods primarily focus on unimodal inputs and suffer from severe catastrophic forgetting in survival prediction. In real-world scenarios, multimodal inputs often provide comprehensive and complementary information, such as whole slide images and genomics; and neglecting inter-modal correlations negatively impacts the performance. To address the two challenges of catastrophic forgetting and complex inter-modal interactions between gigapixel whole slide images and genomics, we propose ConSurv, the first multimodal continual learning (MMCL) method for survival analysis. ConSurv incorporates two key components: Multi-staged Mixture of Experts (MS-MoE) and Feature Constrained Replay (FCR). MS-MoE captures both task-shared and task-specific knowledge at different learning stages of the network, including two modality encoders and the modality fusion component, learning inter-modal relationships. FCR further enhances learned knowledge and mitigates forgetting by restricting feature deviation of previous data at different levels, including encoder-level features of two modalities and the fusion-level representations. Additionally, we introduce a new benchmark integrating four datasets, Multimodal Survival Analysis Incremental Learning (MSAIL), for comprehensive evaluation in the CL setting. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ConSurv outperforms competing methods across multiple metrics.", "AI": {"tldr": "ConSurv\u662f\u9996\u4e2a\u7528\u4e8e\u751f\u5b58\u5206\u6790\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7MS-MoE\u548cFCR\u7ec4\u4ef6\u89e3\u51b3\u707e\u96be\u6027\u9057\u5fd8\u548c\u6a21\u6001\u95f4\u590d\u6742\u4ea4\u4e92\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728MSAIL\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u3002", "motivation": "\u9759\u6001\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u6cd5\u9002\u5e94\u52a8\u6001\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u4e34\u5e8a\u73af\u5883\u548c\u8fde\u7eed\u6570\u636e\u6d41\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u5355\u6a21\u6001\u8f93\u5165\u4e14\u5728\u751f\u5b58\u9884\u6d4b\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u4e25\u91cd\u707e\u96be\u6027\u9057\u5fd8\uff0c\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u8f93\u5165\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u5168\u9762\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5ffd\u89c6\u4e86\u6a21\u6001\u95f4\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faConSurv\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u4e24\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff1a\u591a\u9636\u6bb5\u4e13\u5bb6\u6df7\u5408(MS-MoE)\u6355\u83b7\u7f51\u7edc\u4e0d\u540c\u5b66\u4e60\u9636\u6bb5\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u5171\u4eab\u548c\u7279\u5b9a\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u6001\u95f4\u5173\u7cfb\uff1b\u7279\u5f81\u7ea6\u675f\u56de\u653e(FCR)\u901a\u8fc7\u9650\u5236\u5148\u524d\u6570\u636e\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u5c42\u6b21\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u504f\u5dee\u6765\u589e\u5f3a\u5b66\u4e60\u77e5\u8bc6\u5e76\u51cf\u8f7b\u9057\u5fd8\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u7efc\u5408\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e2d\uff0cConSurv\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u7ade\u4e89\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "ConSurv\u6210\u529f\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u751f\u5b58\u5206\u6790\u4e2d\u7684\u707e\u96be\u6027\u9057\u5fd8\u548c\u590d\u6742\u6a21\u6001\u4ea4\u4e92\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u52a8\u6001\u4e34\u5e8a\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u751f\u5b58\u9884\u6d4b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u7684\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Yet these systems still lack reliable mechanisms to guarantee that sensitive information can be permanently removed once it has been used. Retraining from the beginning is prohibitively costly, and existing unlearning methods remain fragmented, difficult to verify, and often vulnerable to recovery. This paper surveys recent research on machine unlearning for LLMs and considers how far current approaches can address these challenges. We review methods for evaluating whether forgetting has occurred, the resilience of unlearned models against adversarial attacks, and mechanisms that can support user trust when model complexity or proprietary limits restrict transparency. Technical solutions such as differential privacy, homomorphic encryption, federated learning, and ephemeral memory are examined alongside institutional safeguards including auditing practices and regulatory frameworks. The review finds steady progress, but robust and verifiable unlearning is still unresolved. Efficient techniques that avoid costly retraining, stronger defenses against adversarial recovery, and governance structures that reinforce accountability are needed if LLMs are to be deployed safely in sensitive applications. By integrating technical and organizational perspectives, this study outlines a pathway toward AI systems that can be required to forget, while maintaining both privacy and public trust.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7efc\u8ff0\u4e86\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u673a\u5668\u9057\u5fd8\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u5f53\u524d\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u786e\u4fdd\u654f\u611f\u4fe1\u606f\u6c38\u4e45\u5220\u9664\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5e76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u6280\u672f\u548c\u5236\u5ea6\u5c42\u9762\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u654f\u611f\u9886\u57df\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u66b4\u9732\u4e86\u5173\u952e\u5f31\u70b9\uff1a\u65e0\u6cd5\u786e\u4fdd\u79c1\u4eba\u4fe1\u606f\u80fd\u88ab\u6c38\u4e45\u9057\u5fd8\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u7cfb\u7edf\u7f3a\u4e4f\u53ef\u9760\u673a\u5236\u6765\u4fdd\u8bc1\u654f\u611f\u4fe1\u606f\u4f7f\u7528\u540e\u80fd\u88ab\u6c38\u4e45\u5220\u9664\uff0c\u800c\u5b8c\u5168\u91cd\u65b0\u8bad\u7ec3\u6210\u672c\u8fc7\u9ad8\u3002", "method": "\u7efc\u8ff0\u4e86\u673a\u5668\u9057\u5fd8\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u3001\u9057\u5fd8\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6297\u653b\u51fb\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u652f\u6301\u7528\u6237\u4fe1\u4efb\u7684\u673a\u5236\u3002\u6280\u672f\u65b9\u6848\u5305\u62ec\u5dee\u5206\u9690\u79c1\u3001\u540c\u6001\u52a0\u5bc6\u3001\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u77ed\u6682\u8bb0\u5fc6\uff0c\u5236\u5ea6\u4fdd\u969c\u5305\u62ec\u5ba1\u8ba1\u5b9e\u8df5\u548c\u76d1\u7ba1\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u867d\u7136\u53d6\u5f97\u7a33\u6b65\u8fdb\u5c55\uff0c\u4f46\u7a33\u5065\u4e14\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u9057\u5fd8\u95ee\u9898\u4ecd\u672a\u89e3\u51b3\u3002\u9700\u8981\u907f\u514d\u6602\u8d35\u91cd\u65b0\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u6280\u672f\u3001\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u5bf9\u6297\u6062\u590d\u9632\u5fa1\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u52a0\u5f3a\u95ee\u8d23\u7684\u6cbb\u7406\u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6574\u5408\u6280\u672f\u548c\u7ec4\u7ec7\u89c6\u89d2\uff0c\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u6784\u5efa\u80fd\u591f\u6309\u8981\u6c42\u9057\u5fd8\u3001\u540c\u65f6\u7ef4\u62a4\u9690\u79c1\u548c\u516c\u4f17\u4fe1\u4efb\u7684AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u6307\u660e\u4e86\u8def\u5f84\u3002"}}

In practice, selecting the best checkpoint is challenging: evaluating checkpoints on the validation set during training is computationally expensive and requires a good validation set, while relying on the final checkpoint provides no guarantee of good performance. We introduce an uncertainty-guided approach for checkpoint selection (UGCS) that avoids these pitfalls. Our method identifies hard question-answer pairs using per-sample uncertainty and ranks checkpoints by how well they handle these challenging cases. By averaging the rewards of the top-uncertain samples over a short training window, our method produces a stable and discriminative signal without additional forward passes or significant computation overhead. Experiments across three datasets and three LLMs demonstrate that it consistently identifies checkpoints with stronger generalization, outperforming traditional strategies such as relying on training or validation performance. These results highlight that models solving their hardest tasks with low uncertainty are the most reliable overall.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u7684\u68c0\u67e5\u70b9\u9009\u62e9\u65b9\u6cd5(UGCS)\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8bc6\u522b\u56f0\u96be\u6837\u672c\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u6765\u7b5b\u9009\u6700\u4f73\u6a21\u578b\u68c0\u67e5\u70b9\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u9ad8\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u548c\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u5fae\u8c03\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u6a21\u578b\u68c0\u67e5\u70b9\u9009\u62e9\u56f0\u96be\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u8981\u4e48\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\uff08\u9a8c\u8bc1\u96c6\u8bc4\u4f30\uff09\uff0c\u8981\u4e48\u7f3a\u4e4f\u6027\u80fd\u4fdd\u8bc1\uff08\u4ec5\u7528\u6700\u7ec8\u68c0\u67e5\u70b9\uff09\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u66f4\u7a33\u5b9a\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u9009\u62e9\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u7684\u68c0\u67e5\u70b9\u9009\u62e9\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u56f0\u96be\u95ee\u7b54\u5bf9\u7684\u6837\u672c\u7ea7\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8bc4\u4f30\u68c0\u67e5\u70b9\u5728\u6700\u5177\u6311\u6218\u6027\u6837\u672c\u4e0a\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u6765\u6392\u540d\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u77ed\u8bad\u7ec3\u7a97\u53e3\u5185\u9ad8\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u6837\u672c\u5956\u52b1\u7684\u5e73\u5747\u503c\u4f5c\u4e3a\u9009\u62e9\u4fe1\u53f7\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u4e09\u4e2a\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u5730\u8bc6\u522b\u51fa\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u5f3a\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u68c0\u67e5\u70b9\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f9d\u8d56\u8bad\u7ec3\u6216\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u4f20\u7edf\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "conclusion": "\u80fd\u591f\u4ee5\u4f4e\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u89e3\u51b3\u6700\u56f0\u96be\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u662f\u6700\u53ef\u9760\u7684\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u7684\u68c0\u67e5\u70b9\u9009\u62e9\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7a33\u5b9a\u4e14\u6709\u6548\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u9009\u62e9\u7b56\u7565\u3002"}}

To address this problem, we propose a fully differentiable, exemplar-free expandable method composed of two complementary memories: One learns common features that can be used across all tasks, and the other combines the shared features to learn discriminative characteristics unique to each sample. Both memories are differentiable so that the network can autonomously learn latent representations for each sample. For each task, the memory adjustment module adaptively prunes critical slots and minimally expands capacity to accommodate new concepts, and orthogonal regularization enforces geometric separation between preserved and newly learned memory components to prevent interference. Experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Tiny-ImageNet show that the proposed method outperforms 14 state-of-the-art methods for class-incremental learning, achieving final accuracies of 55.13\\%, 37.24\\%, and 30.11\\%, respectively.

To bridge this gap, we introduce the Anchor-based Fair Clustering Framework (AFCF), a novel, general, and plug-and-play framework that empowers arbitrary fair clustering algorithms with linear-time scalability. Our approach first selects a small but representative set of anchors using a novel fair sampling strategy. Then, any off-the-shelf fair clustering algorithm can be applied to this small anchor set. The core of our framework lies in a novel anchor graph construction module, where we formulate an optimization problem to propagate labels while preserving fairness. This is achieved through a carefully designed group-label joint constraint, which we prove theoretically ensures that the fairness of the final clustering on the entire dataset matches that of the anchor clustering. We solve this optimization efficiently using an ADMM-based algorithm.

Electrocardiograms (ECGs) are the most widely used non-invasive tool for cardiac assessment, yet large, well-annotated ECG corpora are scarce due to cost, privacy, and workflow constraints. Generating ECGs can be beneficial for the mechanistic understanding of cardiac electrical activity, enable the construction of large, heterogeneous, and unbiased datasets, and facilitate privacy-preserving data sharing. Generating realistic ECG signals from clinical context is important yet underexplored. Recent work has leveraged diffusion models for text-to-ECG generation, but two challenges remain: (i) existing methods often overlook the physiological simulator knowledge of cardiac activity; and (ii) they ignore broader, experience-based clinical knowledge grounded in real-world practice. To address these gaps, we propose SE-Diff, a novel physiological simulator and experience enhanced diffusion model for comprehensive ECG generation. SE-Diff integrates a lightweight ordinary differential equation (ODE)-based ECG simulator into the diffusion process via a beat decoder and simulator-consistent constraints, injecting mechanistic priors that promote physiologically plausible waveforms. In parallel, we design an LLM-powered experience retrieval-augmented strategy to inject clinical knowledge, providing more guidance for ECG generation.

Weight pruning and coreset selection are two emerging paradigms proposed to improve computational efficiency. In this paper, we first explore the interplay between redundant weights and training samples through a transparent analysis: redundant samples, particularly noisy ones, cause model weights to become unnecessarily overtuned to fit them, complicating the identification of irrelevant weights during pruning; conversely, irrelevant weights tend to overfit noisy data, undermining coreset selection effectiveness. To further investigate and harness this interplay in deep learning, we develop a Simultaneous Weight and Sample Tailoring mechanism (SWaST) that alternately performs weight pruning and coreset selection to establish a synergistic effect in training. During this investigation, we observe that when simultaneously removing a large number of weights and samples, a phenomenon we term critical double-loss can occur, where important weights and their supportive samples are mistakenly eliminated at the same time, leading to model instability and nearly irreversible degradation that cannot be recovered in subsequent training. Unlike classic machine learning models, this issue can arise in deep learning due to the lack of theoretical guarantees on the correctness of weight pruning and coreset selection, which explains why these paradigms are often developed independently. We mitigate this by integrating a state preservation mechanism into SWaST, enabling stable joint optimization.

We show that incremental generation is necessary and sufficient for universal flow-based generation on the largest natural class of self-maps of $[0,1]^d$ compatible with denoising pipelines, namely the orientation-preserving homeomorphisms of $[0,1]^d$. All our guarantees are uniform on the underlying maps and hence imply approximation both samplewise and in distribution.\n  Using a new topological-dynamical argument, we first prove an impossibility theorem: the class of all single-step autonomous flows, independently of the architecture, width, depth, or Lipschitz activation of the underlying neural network, is meagre and therefore not universal in the space of orientation-preserving homeomorphisms of $[0,1]^d$. By exploiting algebraic properties of autonomous flows, we conversely show that every orientation-preserving Lipschitz homeomorphism on $[0,1]^d$ can be approximated at rate $\\mathcal{O}(n^{-1/d})$ by a composition of at most $K_d$ such flows, where $K_d$ depends only on the dimension. Under additional smoothness assumptions, the approximation rate can be made dimension-free, and $K_d$ can be chosen uniformly over the class being approximated. Finally, by linearly lifting the domain into one higher dimension, we obtain structured universal approximation results for continuous functions and for probability measures on $[0,1]^d$, the latter realized as pushforwards of empirical measures with vanishing $1$-Wasserstein error.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u589e\u91cf\u751f\u6210\u5bf9\u4e8e\u57fa\u4e8e\u6d41\u7684\u53bb\u566a\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4fdd\u5411\u540c\u80da\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u7684\u901a\u7528\u903c\u8fd1\u662f\u5fc5\u8981\u4e14\u5145\u5206\u7684\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5355\u6b65\u81ea\u6cbb\u6d41\u65e0\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u901a\u7528\u903c\u8fd1\uff0c\u4f46\u901a\u8fc7\u7ec4\u5408\u6709\u9650\u4e2a\u81ea\u6cbb\u6d41\u53ef\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u903c\u8fd1\u3002", "motivation": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u6d41\u7684\u589e\u91cf\u53bb\u566a\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u751f\u6210\u5efa\u6a21\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u4e25\u683c\u7684\u903c\u8fd1\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u4e3a\u8fd9\u7c7b\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u6570\u5b66\u4e0a\u7684\u4e25\u683c\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u660e\u786e\u589e\u91cf\u751f\u6210\u5728\u901a\u7528\u903c\u8fd1\u4e2d\u7684\u5fc5\u8981\u6027\u548c\u5145\u5206\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u62d3\u6251\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u65b9\u6cd5\u8bc1\u660e\u5355\u6b65\u81ea\u6cbb\u6d41\u65e0\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u901a\u7528\u903c\u8fd1\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u5229\u7528\u81ea\u6cbb\u6d41\u7684\u4ee3\u6570\u6027\u8d28\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ec4\u5408\u6709\u9650\u4e2a\u81ea\u6cbb\u6d41\u6765\u903c\u8fd1\u4fdd\u5411Lipschitz\u540c\u80da\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u7ebf\u6027\u63d0\u5347\u5230\u9ad8\u7ef4\u7a7a\u95f4\u6765\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9\u8fde\u7eed\u51fd\u6570\u548c\u6982\u7387\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u903c\u8fd1\u3002", "result": "\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5355\u6b65\u81ea\u6cbb\u6d41\u5728\u4fdd\u5411\u540c\u80da\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u662f\u975e\u901a\u7528\u7684\uff0c\u4f46\u901a\u8fc7\u7ec4\u5408\u6700\u591aK_d\u4e2a\u81ea\u6cbb\u6d41\u53ef\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0O(n^{-1/d})\u7684\u903c\u8fd1\u901f\u7387\uff0c\u5728\u5149\u6ed1\u6027\u5047\u8bbe\u4e0b\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u7ef4\u5ea6\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u903c\u8fd1\u901f\u7387\uff0c\u5e76\u80fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9\u8fde\u7eed\u51fd\u6570\u548c\u6982\u7387\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u901a\u7528\u903c\u8fd1\u3002", "conclusion": "\u589e\u91cf\u751f\u6210\u662f\u57fa\u4e8e\u6d41\u53bb\u566a\u6a21\u578b\u5b9e\u73b0\u901a\u7528\u903c\u8fd1\u7684\u5173\u952e\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6709\u9650\u6b65\u7684\u81ea\u6cbb\u6d41\u7ec4\u5408\u53ef\u4ee5\u9ad8\u6548\u903c\u8fd1\u590d\u6742\u7684\u53d8\u6362\uff0c\u4e3a\u8fd9\u7c7b\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u575a\u5b9e\u7684\u6570\u5b66\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

As dataset size increases, this bias drives generation toward overly smooth, homogeneous samples, reducing intra-class diversity and limiting generalization. We present PRISM (PRIors from diverse Source Models), a framework that disentangles architectural priors during synthesis. PRISM decouples the logit-matching and regularization objectives, supervising them with different teacher architectures: a primary model for logits and a stochastic subset for batch-normalization (BN) alignment. On ImageNet-1K, PRISM consistently and reproducibly outperforms single-teacher methods (e.g., SRe2L) and recent multi-teacher variants (e.g., G-VBSM) at low- and mid-IPC regimes.

However, prevailing unsupervised GAD methods typically presuppose complete node attributes and structure information, a condition hardly satisfied in real-world scenarios owing to privacy, collection errors or dynamic node arrivals. Existing standard imputation schemes risk \"repairing\" rare anomalous nodes so that they appear normal, thereby introducing imputation bias into the detection process. In addition, when both node attributes and edges are missing simultaneously, estimation errors in one view can contaminate the other, causing cross-view interference that further undermines the detection performance. To overcome these challenges, we propose M$^2$V-UGAD, a multiple missing values-resistant unsupervised GAD framework on incomplete graphs. Specifically, a dual-pathway encoder is first proposed to independently reconstruct missing node attributes and graph structure, thereby preventing errors in one view from propagating to the other. The two pathways are then fused and regularized in a joint latent space so that normals occupy a compact inner manifold while anomalies reside on an outer shell. Lastly, to mitigate imputation bias, we sample latent codes just outside the normal region and decode them into realistic node features and subgraphs, providing hard negative examples that sharpen the decision boundary. Experiments on seven public benchmarks demonstrate that M$^2$V-UGAD consistently outperforms existing unsupervised GAD methods across varying missing rates.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86M\u00b2V-UGAD\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5904\u7406\u56fe\u7ed3\u6784\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u8282\u70b9\u5c5e\u6027\u548c\u8fb9\u540c\u65f6\u7f3a\u5931\u7684\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53cc\u8def\u5f84\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u9632\u6b62\u8de8\u89c6\u56fe\u5e72\u6270\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u786c\u8d1f\u4f8b\u7f13\u89e3\u63d2\u8865\u504f\u5dee\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u56fe\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u5047\u8bbe\u5b8c\u6574\u7684\u8282\u70b9\u5c5e\u6027\u548c\u7ed3\u6784\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u6570\u636e\u5f80\u5f80\u5b58\u5728\u7f3a\u5931\u3002\u6807\u51c6\u63d2\u8865\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u80fd\u4fee\u590d\u5f02\u5e38\u8282\u70b9\u4f7f\u5176\u770b\u8d77\u6765\u6b63\u5e38\uff0c\u4e14\u8282\u70b9\u5c5e\u6027\u548c\u8fb9\u540c\u65f6\u7f3a\u5931\u65f6\u4f1a\u4ea7\u751f\u8de8\u89c6\u56fe\u5e72\u6270\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u53cc\u8def\u5f84\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u72ec\u7acb\u91cd\u5efa\u7f3a\u5931\u7684\u8282\u70b9\u5c5e\u6027\u548c\u56fe\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u9632\u6b62\u9519\u8bef\u4f20\u64ad\uff1b\u5728\u8054\u5408\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u878d\u5408\u548c\u6b63\u5219\u5316\uff0c\u4f7f\u6b63\u5e38\u8282\u70b9\u5360\u636e\u7d27\u51d1\u5185\u6d41\u5f62\uff0c\u5f02\u5e38\u8282\u70b9\u4f4d\u4e8e\u5916\u8868\u9762\uff1b\u91c7\u6837\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u5916\u90e8\u7684\u7f16\u7801\u89e3\u7801\u4e3a\u771f\u5b9e\u8282\u70b9\u7279\u5f81\u548c\u5b50\u56fe\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u786c\u8d1f\u4f8b\u4ee5\u9510\u5316\u51b3\u7b56\u8fb9\u754c\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e03\u4e2a\u516c\u5171\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cM\u00b2V-UGAD\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u7f3a\u5931\u7387\u4e0b\u59cb\u7ec8\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u56fe\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "M\u00b2V-UGAD\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u56fe\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u591a\u91cd\u7f3a\u5931\u503c\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9632\u6b62\u8de8\u89c6\u56fe\u5e72\u6270\u548c\u7f13\u89e3\u63d2\u8865\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u56fe\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

While MLP-based methods have gained attention for achieving Transformer-comparable performance with fewer parameters and better robustness, they face critical limitations including loss of weak seasonal signals, capacity constraints in weight-sharing MLPs, and insufficient channel fusion in channel-independent strategies. To address these challenges, we propose MDMLP-EIA (Multi-domain Dynamic MLPs with Energy Invariant Attention) with three key innovations. First, we develop an adaptive fused dual-domain seasonal MLP that categorizes seasonal signals into strong and weak components. It employs an adaptive zero-initialized channel fusion strategy to minimize noise interference while effectively integrating predictions. Second, we introduce an energy invariant attention mechanism that adaptively focuses on different feature channels within trend and seasonal predictions across time steps. This mechanism maintains constant total signal energy to align with the decomposition-prediction-reconstruction framework and enhance robustness against disturbances.

Electroencephalography (EEG), a non-invasive modality with high temporal resolution, has been widely used for brain states analysis.

In this work, we introduce EEGAgent, a general-purpose framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) to schedule and plan multiple tools to automatically complete EEG-related tasks. EEGAgent is capable of performing the key functions: EEG basic information perception, spatiotemporal EEG exploration, EEG event detection, interaction with users, and EEG report generation.

They treat the detection threshold as a fixed hyperparameter, set once to balance false alarms and late detections, and applied uniformly across all datasets and over time. However, maintaining model performance is the key objective from the perspective of machine learning, and we observe that model performance is highly sensitive to this threshold. This observation inspires us to investigate whether a dynamic threshold could be provably better. In this paper, we prove that a threshold that adapts over time can outperform any single fixed threshold. The main idea of the proof is that a dynamic strategy, constructed by combining the best threshold from each individual data segment, is guaranteed to outperform any single threshold that apply to all segments. Based on the theorem, we propose a Dynamic Threshold Determination algorithm. It enhances existing drift detection frameworks with a novel comparison phase to inform how the threshold should be adjusted.

As tabular datasets grow and span multiple related targets, there is an increasing need to exploit shared task information for improved multitask generalization. Multitask learning (MTL) has emerged as a powerful way to improve generalization and efficiency, yet most existing work focuses narrowly on large-scale recommendation systems, leaving its potential in broader tabular domains largely underexplored. Also, existing MTL approaches for tabular data predominantly rely on multi-layer perceptron-based backbones, which struggle to capture complex feature interactions and often fail to scale when data is abundant, a limitation that transformer architectures have overcome in other domains. Motivated by this, we introduce MultiTab-Net, the first multitask transformer architecture specifically designed for large tabular data. MultiTab-Net employs a novel multitask masked-attention mechanism that dynamically models feature-feature dependencies while mitigating task competition. Through extensive experiments, we show that MultiTab-Net consistently achieves higher multitask gain than existing MTL architectures and single-task transformers across diverse domains including large-scale recommendation data, census-like socioeconomic data, and physics datasets, spanning a wide range of task counts, task types, and feature modalities. In addition, we contribute MultiTab-Bench, a generalized multitask synthetic dataset generator that enables systematic evaluation of multitask dynamics by tuning task count, task correlations, and relative task complexity.

In particular, multimodal learning has emerged as a transformative paradigm, leveraging complementary information from heterogeneous data streams (e.g., text, vision, audio) to advance contextual reasoning and intelligent decision-making. Despite these advancements, current neural network-based models often fall short in open-world environments characterized by inherent unpredictability, where unpredictable environmental composition dynamics, incomplete modality inputs, and spurious distributions relations critically undermine system reliability. While humans naturally adapt to such dynamic, ambiguous scenarios, artificial intelligence systems exhibit stark limitations in robustness, particularly when processing multimodal signals under real-world complexity. This study investigates the fundamental challenge of multimodal learning robustness in open-world settings, aiming to bridge the gap between controlled experimental performance and practical deployment requirements.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u8ba8\u5f00\u653e\u4e16\u754c\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u5f25\u5408\u53d7\u63a7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u5b9e\u9645\u90e8\u7f72\u9700\u6c42\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u57fa\u4e8e\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5f00\u653e\u4e16\u754c\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u5e94\u5bf9\u4e0d\u53ef\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u73af\u5883\u7ec4\u6210\u52a8\u6001\u3001\u4e0d\u5b8c\u6574\u7684\u6a21\u6001\u8f93\u5165\u548c\u865a\u5047\u5206\u5e03\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u800c\u4eba\u7c7b\u5374\u80fd\u81ea\u7136\u9002\u5e94\u8fd9\u79cd\u52a8\u6001\u6a21\u7cca\u573a\u666f\u3002", "method": "\u672a\u5728\u6458\u8981\u4e2d\u660e\u786e\u8bf4\u660e\u5177\u4f53\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f46\u7814\u7a76\u91cd\u70b9\u662f\u89e3\u51b3\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u5f00\u653e\u4e16\u754c\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "result": "\u6458\u8981\u672a\u63d0\u4f9b\u5177\u4f53\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u4f46\u6307\u51fa\u4e86\u5f53\u524dAI\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u5904\u7406\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u590d\u6742\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u4fe1\u53f7\u65f6\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u9650\u5236\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u66f4\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u5e94\u5bf9\u5f00\u653e\u4e16\u754c\u73af\u5883\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u4ee5\u7f29\u5c0f\u53d7\u63a7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e0e\u5b9e\u9645\u90e8\u7f72\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002"}}

Among the automated tuning methods, reinforcement learning (RL)-based methods have recently sought to improve the DBMS knobs tuning process from several different perspectives. However, they still encounter challenges with slow convergence speed during offline training. In this paper, we mainly focus on how to leverage the valuable tuning hints contained in various textual documents such as DBMS manuals and web forums to improve the offline training of RL-based methods. To this end, we propose an efficient DBMS knobs tuning framework named DemoTuner via a novel LLM-assisted demonstration reinforcement learning method. Specifically, to comprehensively and accurately mine tuning hints from documents, we design a structured chain of thought prompt to employ LLMs to conduct a condition-aware tuning hints extraction task. To effectively integrate the mined tuning hints into RL agent training, we propose a hint-aware demonstration reinforcement learning algorithm HA-DDPGfD in DemoTuner. As far as we know, DemoTuner is the first work to introduce the demonstration reinforcement learning algorithm for DBMS knobs tuning. Experimental evaluations conducted on MySQL and PostgreSQL across various workloads demonstrate the significant advantages of DemoTuner in both performance improvement and online tuning cost reduction over three representative baselines including DB-BERT, GPTuner and CDBTune.

These methods can be broadly categorized into the data-level and the algorithm-level. The former aims to synthesize minority-class nodes to mitigate quantity imbalance, while the latter tries to optimize the learning process to highlight minority classes. However, neither category addresses the inherently imbalanced graph structure, which is a fundamental factor that incurs majority-class dominance and minority-class assimilation in GNNs. Our theoretical analysis further supports this critical insight. Therefore, we propose GraphSB (Graph Structural Balance), a novel framework that incorporates Structural Balance as a key strategy to address the underlying imbalanced graph structure before node synthesis. Structural Balance performs a two-stage structure optimization: Structure Enhancement that adaptively builds similarity-based edges to strengthen connectivity of minority-class nodes, and Relation Diffusion that captures higher-order dependencies while amplifying signals from minority classes. Thus, GraphSB balances structural distribution before node synthesis, enabling more effective learning in GNNs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GraphSB significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.

Existing methods, such as those based on Fourier or graph techniques, make strong as- sumptions about the structure of the kernel integral opera- tor, assumptions which may limit expressivity. We present SVD-NO, a neural operator that explicitly parameterizes the kernel by its singular-value decomposition (SVD) and then carries out the integral directly in the low-rank basis. Two lightweight networks learn the left and right singular func- tions, a diagonal parameter matrix learns the singular values, and a Gram-matrix regularizer enforces orthonormality. As SVD-NO approximates the full kernel, it obtains a high de- gree of expressivity. Furthermore, due to its low-rank struc- ture the computational complexity of applying the operator remains reasonable, leading to a practical system. In exten- sive evaluations on five diverse benchmark equations, SVD- NO achieves a new state of the art.

Prefetching heuristics aim to hide this latency by predicting which experts are needed, but prefetch failures introduce significant stalls and amplify inference latency. In the event of a prefetch failure, prior work offers two primary solutions: either fetch the expert on demand, which incurs a long stall due to the PCIe bottleneck, or drop the expert from the computation, which significantly degrades model accuracy.

Despite many recent works on structure tokenization, the properties of the underlying discrete representations are not well understood. In this work, we first demonstrate that the successful utilization of structural tokens in a language model for structure prediction depends on using rich, pre-trained sequence embeddings to bridge the semantic gap between the sequence and structural \"language\". The analysis of the structural vocabulary itself then reveals significant semantic redundancy, where multiple distinct tokens correspond to nearly identical local geometries, acting as \"structural synonyms\". This redundancy, rather than being a flaw, can be exploited with a simple \"synonym swap\" strategy to generate diverse conformational ensembles by perturbing a predicted structure with its structural synonyms.

While quantum circuits are not naturally measured in floating point operations (FLOPs), most HQNNs (in NISQ era) are still trained on classical simulators where FLOPs directly dictate runtime and scalability. Hence, FLOPs represent a practical and viable metric to measure the computational complexity of HQNNs. In this work, we introduce FAQNAS, a FLOPs-aware neural architecture search (NAS) framework that formulates HQNN design as a multi-objective optimization problem balancing accuracy and FLOPs. Unlike traditional approaches, FAQNAS explicitly incorporates FLOPs into the optimization objective, enabling the discovery of architectures that achieve strong performance while minimizing computational cost. Experiments on five benchmark datasets (MNIST, Digits, Wine, Breast Cancer, and Iris) show that quantum FLOPs dominate accuracy improvements, while classical FLOPs remain largely fixed. Pareto-optimal solutions reveal that competitive accuracy can often be achieved with significantly reduced computational cost compared to FLOPs-agnostic baselines.

However, finding a Nash Equilibrium (NE) in large-scale UNSGs is challenging due to their massive and combinatorial action spaces. One common approach to addressing these games is the Policy-Space Response Oracle (PSRO) framework, which requires computing best responses (BR) at each iteration. However, precisely computing exact BRs is impractical in large-scale games, and employing reinforcement learning to approximate BRs inevitably introduces errors, which limits the overall effectiveness of the PSRO methods. Recent advancements in leveraging non-convex stochastic optimization to approximate an NE offer a promising alternative to the burdensome BR computation. However, utilizing existing stochastic optimization techniques with an unbiased loss function for UNSGs remains challenging because the action spaces are too vast to be effectively represented by neural networks. To address these issues, we introduce Tree-based Stochastic Optimization (TSO), a framework that bridges the gap between the stochastic optimization paradigm for NE-finding and the demands of UNSGs. Specifically, we employ the tree-based action representation that maps the whole action space onto a tree structure, addressing the challenge faced by neural networks in representing actions when the action space cannot be enumerated. We then incorporate this representation into the loss function and theoretically demonstrate its equivalence to the unbiased loss function. To further enhance the quality of the converged solution, we introduce a sample-and-prune mechanism that reduces the risk of being trapped in suboptimal local optima. Extensive experimental results indicate the superiority of TSO over other baseline algorithms in addressing the UNSGs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u6811\u7684\u968f\u673a\u4f18\u5316(TSO)\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u57ce\u5e02\u7f51\u7edc\u5b89\u5168\u535a\u5f08\u4e2d\u5bfb\u627e\u7eb3\u4ec0\u5747\u8861\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6811\u7ed3\u6784\u8868\u793a\u52a8\u4f5c\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u91c7\u6837\u526a\u679d\u673a\u5236\u907f\u514d\u5c40\u90e8\u6700\u4f18\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u57ce\u5e02\u7f51\u7edc\u5b89\u5168\u535a\u5f08\u5177\u6709\u5de8\u5927\u7684\u7ec4\u5408\u52a8\u4f5c\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5982PSRO\u6846\u67b6\u9700\u8981\u8ba1\u7b97\u6700\u4f73\u54cd\u5e94\u4f46\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\uff0c\u800c\u73b0\u6709\u968f\u673a\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u56e0\u52a8\u4f5c\u7a7a\u95f4\u8fc7\u5927\u96be\u4ee5\u7528\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u6709\u6548\u8868\u793a\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u6811\u7ed3\u6784\u8868\u793a\u6574\u4e2a\u52a8\u4f5c\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u5c06\u5176\u878d\u5165\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u5e76\u7406\u8bba\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u7b49\u4ef7\u6027\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u91c7\u6837\u526a\u679d\u673a\u5236\u51cf\u5c11\u9677\u5165\u5c40\u90e8\u6700\u4f18\u7684\u98ce\u9669\u3002", "result": "\u5927\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660eTSO\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u57ce\u5e02\u7f51\u7edc\u5b89\u5168\u535a\u5f08\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u5176\u4ed6\u57fa\u7ebf\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "TSO\u6846\u67b6\u6210\u529f\u5f25\u5408\u4e86\u968f\u673a\u4f18\u5316\u8303\u5f0f\u4e0e\u57ce\u5e02\u7f51\u7edc\u5b89\u5168\u535a\u5f08\u9700\u6c42\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u4e3a\u89e3\u51b3\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u535a\u5f08\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

In this paper, we show a new black-box model-agnostic adversarial attack for post-hoc explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI), particularly in the image domain. The goal of the attack is to modify the original explanations while being undetected by the human eye and maintain the same predicted class. In contrast to previous methods, we do not require any access to the model or its weights, but only to the model's computed predictions and explanations. Additionally, the attack is accomplished in a single step while significantly changing the provided explanations, as demonstrated by empirical evaluation. The low requirements of our method expose a critical vulnerability in current explainability methods, raising concerns about their reliability in safety-critical applications. We systematically generate attacks based on the explanations generated by post-hoc explainability methods (saliency maps, integrated gradients, and DeepLIFT SHAP) for pretrained ResNet-18 and ViT-B16 on ImageNet.

However, their strategic deployment raises critical concerns for responsible AI management, particularly regarding the reproduction and amplification of race- and gender-related stereotypes that can undermine organizational ethics. In this work, we investigate whether such societal biases are systematically encoded within the pretrained latent spaces of state-of-the-art T2I models. We conduct an empirical study across the five most popular open-source models, using ten neutral, profession-related prompts to generate 100 images per profession, resulting in a dataset of 5,000 images evaluated by diverse human assessors representing different races and genders. We demonstrate that all five models encode and amplify pronounced societal skew: caregiving and nursing roles are consistently feminized, while high-status professions such as corporate CEO, politician, doctor, and lawyer are overwhelmingly represented by males and mostly White individuals. We further identify model-specific patterns, such as QWEN-Image's near-exclusive focus on East Asian outputs, Kandinsky's dominance of White individuals, and SDXL's comparatively broader but still biased distributions. These results provide critical insights for AI project managers and practitioners, enabling them to select equitable AI models and customized prompts that generate images in alignment with the principles of responsible AI. We conclude by discussing the risks of these biases and proposing actionable strategies for bias mitigation in building responsible GenAI systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u4e94\u4e2a\u4e3b\u6d41\u6587\u672c\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5b83\u4eec\u90fd\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5730\u7f16\u7801\u548c\u653e\u5927\u4e86\u79cd\u65cf\u4e0e\u6027\u522b\u523b\u677f\u5370\u8c61\uff0c\u5982\u62a4\u7406\u804c\u4e1a\u5973\u6027\u5316\u3001\u9ad8\u7ba1\u804c\u4e1a\u7537\u6027\u5316\u548c\u767d\u4eba\u4e3b\u5bfc\u7b49\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u52a8\u673a\u662f\u8c03\u67e5\u6587\u672c\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u662f\u5426\u5728\u5176\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5730\u7f16\u7801\u4e86\u793e\u4f1a\u504f\u89c1\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u504f\u89c1\u53ef\u80fd\u635f\u5bb3\u7ec4\u7ec7\u4f26\u7406\u548c\u8d1f\u8d23\u4efbAI\u7ba1\u7406\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u4e94\u4e2a\u6700\u6d41\u884c\u7684\u5f00\u6e90T2I\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u5341\u4e2a\u4e2d\u6027\u804c\u4e1a\u63d0\u793a\u751f\u62105000\u5f20\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u7531\u4ee3\u8868\u4e0d\u540c\u79cd\u65cf\u548c\u6027\u522b\u7684\u591a\u6837\u5316\u4eba\u7c7b\u8bc4\u4f30\u8005\u8fdb\u884c\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "\u6240\u6709\u4e94\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\u90fd\u7f16\u7801\u5e76\u653e\u5927\u4e86\u660e\u663e\u7684\u793e\u4f1a\u504f\u89c1\uff1a\u62a4\u7406\u89d2\u8272\u6301\u7eed\u5973\u6027\u5316\uff0c\u800c\u9ad8\u7ba1\u3001\u653f\u6cbb\u5bb6\u3001\u533b\u751f\u548c\u5f8b\u5e08\u7b49\u9ad8\u5730\u4f4d\u804c\u4e1a\u4e3b\u8981\u7531\u7537\u6027\u548c\u767d\u4eba\u4ee3\u8868\u3002\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u578b\u6709\u7279\u5b9a\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u5982QWEN-Image\u4e13\u6ce8\u4e8e\u4e1c\u4e9a\u8f93\u51fa\uff0cKandinsky\u4e3b\u5bfc\u767d\u4eba\u4e2a\u4f53\uff0cSDXL\u5206\u5e03\u8f83\u5e7f\u4f46\u4ecd\u5b58\u5728\u504f\u89c1\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7ed3\u679c\u4e3aAI\u9879\u76ee\u7ecf\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5173\u952e\u89c1\u89e3\uff0c\u5e2e\u52a9\u4ed6\u4eec\u9009\u62e9\u516c\u5e73\u7684AI\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u5b9a\u5236\u63d0\u793a\uff0c\u4ee5\u751f\u6210\u7b26\u5408\u8d1f\u8d23\u4efbAI\u539f\u5219\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u8fd8\u8ba8\u8bba\u4e86\u8fd9\u4e9b\u504f\u89c1\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u5728\u6784\u5efa\u8d1f\u8d23\u4efb\u751f\u6210\u5f0fAI\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7f13\u89e3\u504f\u89c1\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u7b56\u7565\u3002"}}

We introduce Matryoshka Transcoders, a novel framework for the automatic discovery and interpretation of physical plausibility features in generative models. Our approach extends the Matryoshka representation learning paradigm to transcoder architectures, enabling hierarchical sparse feature learning at multiple granularity levels. By training on intermediate representations from a physical plausibility classifier and leveraging large multimodal models for interpretation, our method identifies diverse physics-related failure modes without manual feature engineering, achieving superior feature relevance and feature accuracy compared to existing approaches. We utilize the discovered visual patterns to establish a benchmark for evaluating physical plausibility in generative models.

To overcome these limitations, we introduce the Residual-Informed Loss (RI-Loss), a novel objective function based on the Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion (HSIC). RI-Loss explicitly models noise structure by enforcing dependence between the residual sequence and a random time series, enabling more robust, noise-aware representations. Theoretically, we derive the first non-asymptotic HSIC bound with explicit double-sample complexity terms, achieving optimal convergence rates through Bernstein-type concentration inequalities and Rademacher complexity analysis. This provides rigorous guarantees for RI-Loss optimization while precisely quantifying kernel space interactions.

Specifically, EPO leverages stochastic differential equation sampling to explore the conformational landscape and incorporates a novel energy-ranking mechanism based on list-wise preference optimization. Crucially, EPO introduces a practical upper bound to efficiently approximate the intractable probability of long sampling trajectories in continuous-time generative models, making it easily adaptable to existing pretrained generators. On Tetrapeptides, ATLAS, and Fast-Folding benchmarks, EPO successfully generates diverse and physically realistic ensembles, establishing a new state-of-the-art in nine evaluation metrics.

However, offline RL performance under this constraint is often suboptimal. We consider an alternative approach to dealing with limited samples by introducing the Quantum Metric Encoder (QME). In this methodology, instead of applying the RL framework directly on the original states and rewards, we embed the states into a more compact and meaningful representation, where the structure of the encoding is inspired by quantum circuits. For classical data, QME is a classically simulable, trainable unitary embedding and thus serves as a quantum-inspired module, on a classical device. For quantum data in the form of quantum states, QME can be implemented directly on quantum hardware, allowing for training without measurement or re-encoding.\n  We evaluated QME on three datasets, each limited to 100 samples. We use Soft-Actor-Critic (SAC) and Implicit-Q-Learning (IQL), two well-known RL algorithms, to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. From the experimental results, we find that training offline RL agents on QME-embedded states with decoded rewards yields significantly better performance than training on the original states and rewards. On average across the three datasets, for maximum reward performance, we achieve a 116.2% improvement for SAC and 117.6% for IQL.\n  We further investigate the $\u0394$-hyperbolicity of our framework, a geometric property of the state space known to be important for the RL training efficacy. The QME-embedded states exhibit low $\u0394$-hyperbolicity, suggesting that the improvement after embedding arises from the modified geometry of the state space induced by QME. Thus, the low $\u0394$-hyperbolicity and the corresponding effectiveness of QME could provide valuable information for developing efficient offline RL methods under limited-sample conditions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u91cf\u5b50\u5ea6\u91cf\u7f16\u7801\u5668(QME)\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u91cf\u5b50\u542f\u53d1\u7684\u5d4c\u5165\u65b9\u6cd5\u6539\u8fdb\u6709\u9650\u6837\u672c\u4e0b\u7684\u79bb\u7ebf\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5e73\u5747\u63d0\u5347116%\u4ee5\u4e0a", "motivation": "\u73b0\u5b9e\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u901a\u5e38\u9762\u4e34\u6837\u672c\u6709\u9650\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u79bb\u7ebf\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u8fd9\u79cd\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b\u6027\u80fd\u5f80\u5f80\u4e0d\u7406\u60f3\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5bfb\u627e\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u5904\u7406\u6709\u9650\u6837\u672c\u95ee\u9898", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u91cf\u5b50\u5ea6\u91cf\u7f16\u7801\u5668(QME)\uff0c\u5c06\u72b6\u6001\u5d4c\u5165\u5230\u66f4\u7d27\u51d1\u4e14\u6709\u610f\u4e49\u7684\u8868\u793a\u4e2d\uff0c\u7f16\u7801\u7ed3\u6784\u53d7\u91cf\u5b50\u7535\u8def\u542f\u53d1\u3002\u5bf9\u4e8e\u7ecf\u5178\u6570\u636e\uff0cQME\u662f\u53ef\u7ecf\u5178\u6a21\u62df\u7684\u53ef\u8bad\u7ec3\u9149\u5d4c\u5165\uff1b\u5bf9\u4e8e\u91cf\u5b50\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u53ef\u76f4\u63a5\u5728\u91cf\u5b50\u786c\u4ef6\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0", "result": "\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff08\u5404100\u4e2a\u6837\u672c\uff09\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528SAC\u548cIQL\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0cQME\u5d4c\u5165\u72b6\u6001\u76f8\u6bd4\u539f\u59cb\u72b6\u6001\u5728\u6700\u5927\u5956\u52b1\u6027\u80fd\u4e0a\u5e73\u5747\u63d0\u5347116.2%\uff08SAC\uff09\u548c117.6%\uff08IQL\uff09\uff0c\u4e14\u5d4c\u5165\u72b6\u6001\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4f4e\u0394-\u53cc\u66f2\u6027", "conclusion": "QME\u901a\u8fc7\u6539\u53d8\u72b6\u6001\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\u6765\u63d0\u5347\u79bb\u7ebf\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4f4e\u0394-\u53cc\u66f2\u6027\u548cQME\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u53ef\u4e3a\u5f00\u53d1\u6709\u9650\u6837\u672c\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u79bb\u7ebf\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u4f9b\u6709\u4ef7\u503c\u7684\u4fe1\u606f"}}

Current deep learning-based forecasting models primarily employ Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss functions for regression modeling. Despite enabling direct value prediction, this method offers no uncertainty estimation and exhibits poor outlier robustness. To address these limitations, we propose OCE-TS, a novel ordinal classification approach for time series forecasting that replaces MSE with Ordinal Cross-Entropy (OCE) loss, preserving prediction order while quantifying uncertainty through probability output. Specifically, OCE-TS begins by discretizing observed values into ordered intervals and deriving their probabilities via a parametric distribution as supervision signals. Using a simple linear model, we then predict probability distributions for each timestep. The OCE loss is computed between the cumulative distributions of predicted and ground-truth probabilities, explicitly preserving ordinal relationships among forecasted values. Through theoretical analysis using influence functions, we establish that cross-entropy (CE) loss exhibits superior stability and outlier robustness compared to MSE loss.

Yet understanding and extending the principles underlying self-attention remains a key challenge for advancing artificial intelligence. Drawing inspiration from the multiscale dynamics of biological attention and from dynamical systems theory, we introduce Fractional Neural Attention (FNA), a principled, neuroscience-inspired framework for multiscale information processing. FNA models token interactions through L\u00e9vy diffusion governed by the fractional Laplacian, intrinsically realizing simultaneous short- and long-range dependencies across multiple scales. This mechanism yields greater expressivity and faster information mixing, advancing the foundational capacity of Transformers. Theoretically, we show that FNA's dynamics are governed by the fractional diffusion equation, and that the resulting attention networks exhibit larger spectral gaps and shorter path lengths -- mechanistic signatures of enhanced computational efficiency. Empirically, FNA achieves competitive text-classification performance even with a single layer and a single head; it also improves performance in image processing and neural machine translation. Finally, the diffusion map algorithm from geometric harmonics enables dimensionality reduction of FNA weights while preserving the intrinsic structure of embeddings and hidden states. Together, these results establish FNA as a principled mechanism connecting self-attention, stochastic dynamics, and geometry, providing an interpretable, biologically grounded foundation for powerful, neuroscience-inspired AI.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u5206\u6570\u795e\u7ecf\u6ce8\u610f\u529b(FNA)\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7L\u00e9vy\u6269\u6563\u548c\u5206\u6570\u62c9\u666e\u62c9\u65af\u7b97\u5b50\u5efa\u6a21token\u4ea4\u4e92\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u4fe1\u606f\u5904\u7406\uff0c\u63d0\u5347Transformer\u7684\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u53d7\u751f\u7269\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u7684\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u52a8\u6001\u548c\u52a8\u529b\u7cfb\u7edf\u7406\u8bba\u542f\u53d1\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u6269\u5c55\u81ea\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u539f\u7406\uff0c\u4e3aAI\u63d0\u4f9b\u795e\u7ecf\u79d1\u5b66\u57fa\u7840\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u5206\u6570\u62c9\u666e\u62c9\u65af\u7b97\u5b50\u63a7\u5236\u7684L\u00e9vy\u6269\u6563\u6765\u5efa\u6a21token\u4ea4\u4e92\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u540c\u65f6\u7684\u77ed\u7a0b\u548c\u957f\u7a0b\u4f9d\u8d56\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u6269\u6563\u6620\u5c04\u7b97\u6cd5\u8fdb\u884c\u964d\u7ef4\u3002", "result": "FNA\u5728\u6587\u672c\u5206\u7c7b\u3001\u56fe\u50cf\u5904\u7406\u548c\u795e\u7ecf\u673a\u5668\u7ffb\u8bd1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u5355\u5c42\u5355\u5934\u5373\u53ef\u8fbe\u5230\u7ade\u4e89\u6027\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u5927\u7684\u8c31\u95f4\u9699\u548c\u66f4\u77ed\u7684\u8def\u5f84\u957f\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "FNA\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u81ea\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u3001\u968f\u673a\u52a8\u6001\u548c\u51e0\u4f55\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u539f\u5219\u6027\u8054\u7cfb\uff0c\u4e3a\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u79d1\u5b66\u542f\u53d1AI\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u751f\u7269\u5b66\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

More importantly, hierarchical architecture shifts participation from individual clients to client groups, thereby further intensifying this issue. Despite notable advancements in SAFL research, most existing works still focus on conventional cloud-end architectures while largely overlooking the critical impact of non-IID data on scheduling across the cloud-edge-client hierarchy. To tackle these challenges, we propose FedCure, an innovative semi-asynchronous Federated learning framework that leverages coalition construction and participation-aware scheduling to mitigate participation bias with non-IID data. Specifically, FedCure operates through three key rules: (1) a preference rule that optimizes coalition formation by maximizing collective benefits and establishing theoretically stable partitions to reduce non-IID-induced performance degradation; (2) a scheduling rule that integrates the virtual queue technique with Bayesian-estimated coalition dynamics, mitigating efficiency loss while ensuring mean rate stability; and (3) a resource allocation rule that enhances computational efficiency by optimizing client CPU frequencies based on estimated coalition dynamics while satisfying delay requirements. Comprehensive experiments on four real-world datasets demonstrate that FedCure improves accuracy by up to 5.1x compared with four state-of-the-art baselines, while significantly enhancing efficiency with the lowest coefficient of variation 0.0223 for per-round latency and maintaining long-term balance across diverse scenarios.", "AI": {"tldr": "FedCure\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u521b\u65b0\u7684\u534a\u5f02\u6b65\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8054\u76df\u6784\u5efa\u548c\u53c2\u4e0e\u611f\u77e5\u8c03\u5ea6\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u975eIID\u6570\u636e\u4e0b\u7684\u53c2\u4e0e\u504f\u5dee\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u56db\u4e2a\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u76f8\u6bd4\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u63d0\u5347\u9ad8\u8fbe5.1\u500d\u3002", "motivation": "\u534a\u5f02\u6b65\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u867d\u7136\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u540c\u6b65\u8bad\u7ec3\u6548\u7387\u548c\u5f02\u6b65\u66f4\u65b0\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u5b58\u5728\u53c2\u4e0e\u504f\u5dee\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u975eIID\u6570\u636e\u5206\u5e03\u4e0b\u66f4\u4e3a\u4e25\u91cd\u3002\u5206\u5c42\u67b6\u6784\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u52a0\u5267\u4e86\u8fd9\u4e00\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u5927\u591a\u5ffd\u89c6\u975eIID\u6570\u636e\u5728\u4e91-\u8fb9-\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u5c42\u6b21\u8c03\u5ea6\u4e2d\u7684\u5173\u952e\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "FedCure\u901a\u8fc7\u4e09\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u89c4\u5219\u8fd0\u4f5c\uff1a(1)\u504f\u597d\u89c4\u5219\u4f18\u5316\u8054\u76df\u5f62\u6210\uff0c\u6700\u5927\u5316\u96c6\u4f53\u5229\u76ca\u5e76\u5efa\u7acb\u7406\u8bba\u7a33\u5b9a\u5206\u533a\uff1b(2)\u8c03\u5ea6\u89c4\u5219\u7ed3\u5408\u865a\u62df\u961f\u5217\u6280\u672f\u548c\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u8054\u76df\u52a8\u6001\uff1b(3)\u8d44\u6e90\u5206\u914d\u89c4\u5219\u57fa\u4e8e\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u8054\u76df\u52a8\u6001\u4f18\u5316\u5ba2\u6237\u7aefCPU\u9891\u7387\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u56db\u4e2a\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u7efc\u5408\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cFedCure\u76f8\u6bd4\u56db\u79cd\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u63d0\u5347\u9ad8\u8fbe5.1\u500d\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u6bcf\u8f6e\u5ef6\u8fdf\u7684\u53d8\u5f02\u7cfb\u6570\u6700\u4f4e\u4e3a0.0223\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u5404\u79cd\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u4fdd\u6301\u957f\u671f\u5e73\u8861\u3002", "conclusion": "FedCure\u901a\u8fc7\u8054\u76df\u6784\u5efa\u548c\u53c2\u4e0e\u611f\u77e5\u8c03\u5ea6\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u4e86\u975eIID\u6570\u636e\u4e0b\u7684\u53c2\u4e0e\u504f\u5dee\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u6548\u7387\u65b9\u9762\u5747\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u4e3a\u5206\u5c42\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Operating on sequential graph serializations, LLMs can produce different outputs under node reindexing, edge reordering, or formatting changes, raising robustness concerns. We systematically analyze these effects, studying how fine-tuning impacts encoding sensitivity as well generalization on unseen tasks. We propose a principled decomposition of graph serializations into node labeling, edge encoding, and syntax, and evaluate LLM robustness to variations of each of these factors on a comprehensive benchmarking suite. We also contribute a novel set of spectral tasks to further assess generalization abilities of fine-tuned reasoners. Results show that larger (non-fine-tuned) models are more robust.

However, they often struggle to accurately quantify the uncertainty of their predictions, limiting their broader adoption in critical real-world applications. Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) for Deep Learning seeks to address this challenge by providing methods to improve the reliability of uncertainty estimates. Although numerous techniques have been proposed, a unified tool offering a seamless workflow to evaluate and integrate these methods remains lacking. To bridge this gap, we introduce Torch-Uncertainty, a PyTorch and Lightning-based framework designed to streamline DNN training and evaluation with UQ techniques and metrics.

In this work, we introduce OutSafe-Bench, the first most comprehensive content safety evaluation test suite designed for the multimodal era. OutSafe-Bench includes a large-scale dataset that spans four modalities, featuring over 18,000 bilingual (Chinese and English) text prompts, 4,500 images, 450 audio clips and 450 videos, all systematically annotated across nine critical content risk categories. In addition to the dataset, we introduce a Multidimensional Cross Risk Score (MCRS), a novel metric designed to model and assess overlapping and correlated content risks across different categories. To ensure fair and robust evaluation, we propose FairScore, an explainable automated multi-reviewer weighted aggregation framework.

Most studies tackle this bias by balancing distributions globally, but ignore individual heterogeneity and fail to capture the local structure that represents the natural clustering among individuals, which ultimately compromises ITE estimation. While instance-level alignment methods consider heterogeneity, they similarly overlook the local structure information. To address these issues, we propose an end-to-end Multi-\\textbf{P}rototype alignment method for \\textbf{ITE} estimation (\\textbf{PITE}). PITE effectively captures local structure within groups and enforces cross-group alignment, thereby achieving robust ITE estimation. Specifically, we first define prototypes as cluster centroids based on similar individuals under the same treatment. To identify local similarity and the distribution consistency, we perform instance-to-prototype matching to assign individuals to the nearest prototype within groups, and design a multi-prototype alignment strategy to encourage the matched prototypes to be close across treatment arms in the latent space. PITE not only reduces distribution shift through fine-grained, prototype-level alignment, but also preserves the local structures of treated and control groups, which provides meaningful constraints for ITE estimation.

Though this problem has been extensively studied in previous work, most existing methods remain susceptible to various adversarial attacks. In this paper, we first study DeCMA2B with adversarial corruption, where an adversary can corrupt reward observations of all agents with a limited corruption budget. We propose a robust algorithm, called DeMABAR, which ensures that each agent's individual regret suffers only an additive term proportional to the corruption budget. Then we consider a more realistic scenario where the adversary can only attack a small number of agents. Our theoretical analysis shows that the DeMABAR algorithm can also almost completely eliminate the influence of adversarial attacks and is inherently robust in the Byzantine setting, where an unknown fraction of the agents can be Byzantine, i.e., may arbitrarily select arms and communicate wrong information.

When formulated in terms of the adjacency matrix of the neural network, as we do in the paper, these gradient flow equations form a class of converging matrix ODEs which is nilpotent, polynomial, isospectral, and with conservation laws. The loss landscape is described in detail. It is characterized by infinitely many global minima and saddle points, both strict and nonstrict, but lacks local minima and maxima. The loss function itself is a positive semidefinite Lyapunov function for the gradient flow, and its level sets are unbounded invariant sets of critical points, with critical values that correspond to the amount of singular values of the input-output data learnt by the gradient along a certain trajectory. The adjacency matrix representation we use in the paper allows to highlight the existence of a quotient space structure in which each critical value of the loss function is represented only once, while all other critical points with the same critical value belong to the fiber associated to the quotient space. It also allows to easily determine stable and unstable submanifolds at the saddle points, even when the Hessian fails to obtain them.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u7efc\u8ff0\u4e86\u6df1\u5ea6\u7ebf\u6027\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u68af\u5ea6\u6d41\u65b9\u7a0b\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u548c\u635f\u5931\u666f\u89c2\u7684\u6700\u65b0\u8fdb\u5c55\uff0c\u91cd\u70b9\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u65e0\u6fc0\u6d3b\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u5728\u4e8c\u6b21\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u4e0b\u7684\u68af\u5ea6\u4e0b\u964d\u8bad\u7ec3\u52a8\u6001\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u6df1\u5ea6\u7ebf\u6027\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u52a8\u6001\u548c\u635f\u5931\u666f\u89c2\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u5176\u68af\u5ea6\u6d41\u65b9\u7a0b\u7684\u6570\u5b66\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u6536\u655b\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u6df1\u5ea6\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u4f18\u5316\u63d0\u4f9b\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u90bb\u63a5\u77e9\u9635\u8868\u793a\u6cd5\u63cf\u8ff0\u68af\u5ea6\u6d41\u65b9\u7a0b\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u8fd9\u7c7b\u6536\u655b\u77e9\u9635ODE\u7684nilpotent\u3001\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u3001\u7b49\u8c31\u548c\u5b88\u6052\u5f8b\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u8be6\u7ec6\u523b\u753b\u635f\u5931\u666f\u89c2\u7684\u4e34\u754c\u70b9\u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u635f\u5931\u666f\u89c2\u5305\u542b\u65e0\u9650\u591a\u4e2a\u5168\u5c40\u6700\u5c0f\u503c\u548c\u978d\u70b9\uff08\u4e25\u683c\u548c\u975e\u4e25\u683c\uff09\uff0c\u4f46\u6ca1\u6709\u5c40\u90e8\u6700\u5c0f\u503c\u548c\u6700\u5927\u503c\u3002\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u672c\u8eab\u662f\u68af\u5ea6\u6d41\u7684\u6b63\u534a\u5b9aLyapunov\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u5176\u6c34\u5e73\u96c6\u662f\u65e0\u754c\u4e0d\u53d8\u4e34\u754c\u70b9\u96c6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u90bb\u63a5\u77e9\u9635\u8868\u793a\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u5546\u7a7a\u95f4\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u6bcf\u4e2a\u4e34\u754c\u503c\u5728\u5546\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u53ea\u51fa\u73b0\u4e00\u6b21\uff0c\u5176\u4ed6\u5177\u6709\u76f8\u540c\u4e34\u754c\u503c\u7684\u4e34\u754c\u70b9\u5c5e\u4e8e\u76f8\u5e94\u7684\u7ea4\u7ef4\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u8fd8\u80fd\u786e\u5b9a\u978d\u70b9\u5904\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u548c\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u5b50\u6d41\u5f62\u3002"}}

However, current approaches to developing such agents remain costly and inefficient, as they typically require manually constructed task datasets and reinforcement learning (RL) pipelines with extensive random exploration. These limitations lead to prohibitively high data-construction costs, low exploration efficiency, and poor sample utilization. To address these challenges, we present AgentEvolver, a self-evolving agent system that leverages the semantic understanding and reasoning capabilities of LLMs to drive autonomous agent learning. AgentEvolver introduces three synergistic mechanisms: (i) self-questioning, which enables curiosity-driven task generation in novel environments, reducing dependence on handcrafted datasets; (ii) self-navigating, which improves exploration efficiency through experience reuse and hybrid policy guidance; and (iii) self-attributing, which enhances sample efficiency by assigning differentiated rewards to trajectory states and actions based on their contribution. By integrating these mechanisms into a unified framework, AgentEvolver enables scalable, cost-effective, and continual improvement of agent capabilities.

To improve robustness, many test-time adaptation (TTA) methods adopt positive data augmentation (PDA), which generates multiple views of each test sample to reduce prediction variance. However, these methods suffer from two key limitations. First, it introduces considerable computational overhead due to the large number of augmentations required per image. Second, it fails to mitigate prediction bias, where the model tends to predict certain classes disproportionately under corruption, as PDA operates on corrupted inputs and typically does not remove the corruption itself. To address these challenges, we propose Panda, a novel TTA method based on negative data augmentation (NDA). Unlike positive augmentations that preserve object semantics, Panda generates negative augmentations by disrupting semantic content. It divides images into patches and randomly assembles them from a shared patch pool. These negatively augmented images retain corruption-specific features while discarding object-relevant signals. We then subtract the mean feature of these negative samples from the original image feature, effectively suppressing corruption-related components while preserving class-relevant information. This mitigates prediction bias under distribution shifts. Panda allows augmentation to be shared across samples within a batch, resulting in minimal computational overhead. Panda can be seamlessly integrated into existing test-time adaptation frameworks and substantially improve their robustness.

In Dynamic Tanh (DyT), the author demonstrated that Tanh can be used as an alternative layer normalization (LN) and confirmed the effectiveness of the idea. But Tanh itself faces orthogonality, linearity and distortion problems. Due to that, his proposition cannot be reliable. So we propose a Holonorm (hn) which has residual connections and nonlinearity. Holonorm is suitable for replacing Tanh in the context of normalization. Although the HoloNorm expression could be similar to the softsign function in dimension one, softsign is a componentwise function which is not good for tensors and vectors of great dimension. Holonorm preserves the orthogonality, the direction, the invertibility of the signal. Holonorm is also a suitable metric, maps all vectors into the open unit ball. This prevents exploding activations and improves stability in deep Transformer models. In this work, we have meticulously examined the normalization in transformers and say that Holonorm, a generalized form of softsign function suited as a normalization function first.Second, defined between 0 and 1 hn serves as a percentage, and $1 - \\text{Holonorm}$ is its complement, making it better understandable in evaluating a model.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faHolonorm\u4f5c\u4e3aTransformer\u4e2d\u66ff\u4ee3Tanh\u7684\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86Tanh\u7684\u6b63\u4ea4\u6027\u3001\u7ebf\u6027\u548c\u5931\u771f\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u6b8b\u5dee\u8fde\u63a5\u548c\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u80fd\u9632\u6b62\u6fc0\u6d3b\u7206\u70b8\u5e76\u63d0\u9ad8\u6a21\u578b\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "Tanh\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5c42\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\u5b58\u5728\u6b63\u4ea4\u6027\u3001\u7ebf\u6027\u548c\u5931\u771f\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5176\u4e0d\u53ef\u9760\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faHolonorm\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u6b8b\u5dee\u8fde\u63a5\u548c\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u4fdd\u6301\u4fe1\u53f7\u7684\u6b63\u4ea4\u6027\u3001\u65b9\u5411\u548c\u53ef\u9006\u6027\uff0c\u5c06\u5411\u91cf\u6620\u5c04\u5230\u5355\u4f4d\u5f00\u7403\u5185\u3002", "result": "Holonorm\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u9632\u6b62\u6fc0\u6d3b\u7206\u70b8\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u6df1\u5ea6Transformer\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u4e14\u5176\u503c\u57280\u52301\u4e4b\u95f4\u4fbf\u4e8e\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "conclusion": "Holonorm\u662fsoftsign\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u5e7f\u4e49\u5f62\u5f0f\uff0c\u9002\u5408\u4f5c\u4e3aTransformer\u4e2d\u7684\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u6bd4Tanh\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u4e14\u6613\u4e8e\u7406\u89e3\u3002"}}

Large datasets improve model accuracy and generalization but are computationally expensive to produce and train on, while smaller datasets risk discarding rare but important atomic environments and compromising MLIP accuracy/reliability. Here, we develop an information-theoretical framework to quantify the efficiency of dataset compression methods and propose an algorithm that maximizes this efficiency. By framing atomistic dataset compression as an instance of the minimum set cover (MSC) problem over atom-centered environments, our method identifies the smallest subset of structures that contains as much information as possible from the original dataset while pruning redundant information. The approach is extensively demonstrated on the GAP-20 and TM23 datasets, and validated on 64 varied datasets from the ColabFit repository. Across all cases, MSC consistently retains outliers, preserves dataset diversity, and reproduces the long-tail distributions of forces even at high compression rates, outperforming other subsampling methods. Furthermore, MLIPs trained on MSC-compressed datasets exhibit reduced error for out-of-distribution data even in low-data regimes. We explain these results using an outlier analysis and show that such quantitative conclusions could not be achieved with conventional dimensionality reduction methods.

This study introduces Oya, a novel real-time precipitation retrieval algorithm utilizing the full spectrum of visible and infrared (VIS-IR) observations from geostationary (GEO) satellites. Oya employs a two-stage deep learning approach, combining two U-Net models: one for precipitation detection and another for quantitative precipitation estimation (QPE), to address the inherent data imbalance between rain and no-rain events. The models are trained using high-resolution GPM Combined Radar-Radiometer Algorithm (CORRA) v07 data as ground truth and pre-trained on IMERG-Final retrievals to enhance robustness and mitigate overfitting due to the limited temporal sampling of CORRA. By leveraging multiple GEO satellites, Oya achieves quasi-global coverage and demonstrates superior performance compared to existing competitive regional and global precipitation baselines, offering a promising pathway to improved precipitation monitoring and forecasting.", "AI": {"tldr": "Oya\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u5229\u7528\u5730\u7403\u9759\u6b62\u536b\u661f\u53ef\u89c1\u5149\u548c\u7ea2\u5916\u5168\u5149\u8c31\u89c2\u6d4b\u7684\u65b0\u578b\u5b9e\u65f6\u964d\u6c34\u53cd\u6f14\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u964d\u6c34\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u5b9a\u91cf\u964d\u6c34\u4f30\u8ba1\u65b9\u9762\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u5168\u7403\u5357\u65b9\u5730\u533a\u5730\u9762\u89c2\u6d4b\u7f51\u7edc\u7a00\u758f\u4e14\u9884\u62a5\u80fd\u529b\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u536b\u661f\u964d\u6c34\u4ea7\u54c1\u4e3b\u8981\u4f9d\u8d56\u957f\u6ce2\u7ea2\u5916\u901a\u9053\u6216\u4f7f\u7528\u53ef\u80fd\u5f15\u5165\u663e\u8457\u8bef\u5dee\u7684\u6821\u51c6\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u6b21\u65e5\u65f6\u95f4\u5c3a\u5ea6\u4e0a\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4e24\u4e2aU-Net\u6a21\u578b\uff1a\u4e00\u4e2a\u7528\u4e8e\u964d\u6c34\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u53e6\u4e00\u4e2a\u7528\u4e8e\u5b9a\u91cf\u964d\u6c34\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3\u96e8\u548c\u65e0\u96e8\u4e8b\u4ef6\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6570\u636e\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u4f7f\u7528GPM CORRA v07\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u6570\u636e\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5730\u9762\u771f\u503c\uff0c\u5e76\u5728IMERG-Final\u53cd\u6f14\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u4ee5\u589e\u5f3a\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5229\u7528\u591a\u4e2a\u5730\u7403\u9759\u6b62\u536b\u661f\uff0cOya\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u51c6\u5168\u7403\u8986\u76d6\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u6027\u80fd\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u7ade\u4e89\u6027\u533a\u57df\u548c\u5168\u7403\u964d\u6c34\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "Oya\u4e3a\u6539\u8fdb\u964d\u6c34\u76d1\u6d4b\u548c\u9884\u62a5\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u6761\u6709\u524d\u666f\u7684\u9014\u5f84\u3002"}}

In recent times, Pre-LayerNorm transformers have become the preferred choice over Post-LayerNorm transformers due to their stable gradient flow. However, the impact of LayerNorm on learning and memorization across these architectures remains unclear. In this work, we investigate how LayerNorm influences memorization and learning for Pre- and Post-LayerNorm transformers. We identify that LayerNorm serves as a key factor for stable learning in Pre-LayerNorm transformers, while in Post-LayerNorm transformers, it impacts memorization. Our analysis reveals that eliminating LayerNorm parameters in Pre-LayerNorm models exacerbates memorization and destabilizes learning, while in Post-LayerNorm models, it effectively mitigates memorization by restoring genuine labels. We further precisely identify that early layers LayerNorm are the most critical over middle/later layers and their influence varies across Pre and Post LayerNorm models. We have validated it through 13 models across 6 Vision and Language datasets.

Classical methods like the Baum-Welch (EM) algorithm are computationally intensive and prone to local optima, while modern spectral algorithms offer provable guarantees but may produce probability outputs outside valid ranges. This work introduces Belief Net, a novel framework that learns HMM parameters through gradient-based optimization by formulating the HMM's forward filter as a structured neural network. Unlike black-box Transformer models, Belief Net's learnable weights are explicitly the logits of the initial distribution, transition matrix, and emission matrix, ensuring full interpretability. The model processes observation sequences using a decoder-only architecture and is trained end-to-end with standard autoregressive next-observation prediction loss. On synthetic HMM data, Belief Net achieves superior convergence speed compared to Baum-Welch, successfully recovering parameters in both undercomplete and overcomplete settings where spectral methods fail.

Such approaches risk recommending insensitive or unsafe interventions, especially in domains involving serious mental illness, substance use disorders, or depression. To address this limitation, we propose a Responsible Reinforcement Learning (RRL) framework that integrates emotional and contextual understanding with ethical considerations into the sequential decision-making process. RRL formulates personalization as a Constrained Markov Decision Process (CMDP), where the agent optimizes engagement and adherence while ensuring emotional alignment and ethical safety. We introduce a multi-objective reward function that explicitly balances short-term behavioral engagement with long-term user well-being, and define an emotion-informed state representation that captures fluctuations in emotional readiness, affect, and risk. The proposed architecture can be instantiated with any RL algorithm (e.g., DQN, PPO) augmented with safety constraints or Lagrangian regularization. Conceptually, this framework operationalizes empathy and responsibility within machine learning policy optimization, bridging safe RL, affective computing and responsible AI. We discuss the implications of this approach for human-centric domains such as behavioral health, education, and digital therapeutics, and outline simulation-based validation paths for future empirical work.

This demands parallel acquisition functions that hedge between designs and the ability to rapidly sample from a joint predictive density to approximate them. Through the framework of Epistemic Neural Networks (ENNs), we obtain scalable joint predictive distributions of binding affinity on top of representations taken from large structure-informed models. Key to this work is an investigation into the importance of prior networks in ENNs and how to pretrain them on synthetic data to improve downstream performance in Batch BO.

Each pull of an arm provides reward that increases monotonically with diminishing returns. A growing line of work has designed algorithms for improving bandits, albeit with somewhat pessimistic worst-case guarantees. Indeed, strong lower bounds of $\u03a9(k)$ and $\u03a9(\\sqrt{k})$ multiplicative approximation factors are known for both deterministic and randomized algorithms (respectively) relative to the optimal arm, where $k$ is the number of bandit arms. In this work, we propose two new parameterized families of bandit algorithms and bound the sample complexity of learning the near-optimal algorithm from each family using offline data. The first family we define includes the optimal randomized algorithm from prior work. We show that an appropriately chosen algorithm from this family can achieve stronger guarantees, with optimal dependence on $k$, when the arm reward curves satisfy additional properties related to the strength of concavity. Our second family contains algorithms that both guarantee best-arm identification on well-behaved instances and revert to worst case guarantees on poorly-behaved instances. Taking a statistical learning perspective on the bandit rewards optimization problem, we achieve stronger data-dependent guarantees without the need for actually verifying whether the assumptions are satisfied.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e24\u4e2a\u65b0\u7684\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u591a\u81c2\u8001\u864e\u673a\u7b97\u6cd5\u5bb6\u65cf\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u79bb\u7ebf\u6570\u636e\u5b66\u4e60\u8fd1\u6700\u4f18\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u5956\u52b1\u66f2\u7ebf\u6ee1\u8db3\u989d\u5916\u51f9\u6027\u6761\u4ef6\u65f6\u83b7\u5f97\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u4fdd\u8bc1\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u8bc1\u5728\u826f\u597d\u5b9e\u4f8b\u4e0a\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u81c2\u8bc6\u522b\u548c\u6076\u52a3\u5b9e\u4f8b\u4e0a\u7684\u6700\u574f\u60c5\u51b5\u4fdd\u8bc1\u3002", "motivation": "\u6539\u8fdb\u7684\u591a\u81c2\u8001\u864e\u673a\u95ee\u9898\u7528\u4e8e\u5728\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4e0b\u5206\u914d\u52aa\u529b\uff0c\u5982\u6295\u8d44\u65b0\u6280\u672f\u7814\u7a76\u3001\u4e34\u5e8a\u8bd5\u9a8c\u548c\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u9009\u62e9\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u6700\u574f\u60c5\u51b5\u4fdd\u8bc1\u8f83\u4e3a\u60b2\u89c2\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u03a9(k)\u548c\u03a9(\u221ak)\u7684\u4e0b\u754c\u3002", "method": "\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e86\u4e24\u4e2a\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5\u5bb6\u65cf\uff1a\u7b2c\u4e00\u4e2a\u5305\u542b\u5148\u524d\u5de5\u4f5c\u4e2d\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u968f\u673a\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u7b2c\u4e8c\u4e2a\u5305\u542b\u5728\u826f\u597d\u5b9e\u4f8b\u4e0a\u4fdd\u8bc1\u6700\u4f18\u81c2\u8bc6\u522b\u3001\u5728\u6076\u52a3\u5b9e\u4f8b\u4e0a\u56de\u9000\u5230\u6700\u574f\u60c5\u51b5\u4fdd\u8bc1\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002\u5229\u7528\u79bb\u7ebf\u6570\u636e\u5b66\u4e60\u6bcf\u4e2a\u5bb6\u65cf\u4e2d\u7684\u8fd1\u6700\u4f18\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u5f53\u81c2\u5956\u52b1\u66f2\u7ebf\u6ee1\u8db3\u989d\u5916\u51f9\u6027\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u8d28\u65f6\uff0c\u4ece\u7b2c\u4e00\u4e2a\u5bb6\u65cf\u4e2d\u9009\u62e9\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\u53ef\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u4fdd\u8bc1\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u5bf9k\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\u3002\u7b2c\u4e8c\u4e2a\u5bb6\u65cf\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u6570\u636e\u4f9d\u8d56\u4fdd\u8bc1\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5047\u8bbe\u662f\u5426\u6ee1\u8db3\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7edf\u8ba1\u5b66\u4e60\u89c6\u89d2\u5904\u7406\u8001\u864e\u673a\u5956\u52b1\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5\u5bb6\u65cf\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u5b9e\u4f8b\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u63d0\u4f9b\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u5f3a\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u4fdd\u8bc1\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u624b\u52a8\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5047\u8bbe\u6761\u4ef6\u3002"}}
