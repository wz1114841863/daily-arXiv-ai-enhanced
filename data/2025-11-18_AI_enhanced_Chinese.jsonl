Existing test strategies, including histogram-based approaches, sine wave testing, and model-driven reconstruction, often rely on dense data acquisition followed by offline post-processing, which increases overall test time and complexity.

UGLMS is a closed-loop test strategy that adaptively selects SAR ADC code edges based on model uncertainty and refines a behavioral mismatch model in real time via an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF), eliminating full-range sweeps and offline post-processing. We introduce an enhanced UGLMS that delivers significantly faster test runtimes while maintaining estimation accuracy. First, a rank-1 EKF update replaces costly matrix inversions with efficient vector operations, and a measurement-aligned covariance-inflation strategy accelerates convergence under unexpected innovations. Second, we extend the static mismatch model with a low-order carrier polynomial to capture systematic nonlinearities beyond pure capacitor mismatch. Third, a trace-based termination adapts test length to convergence, preventing premature stops and redundant iterations. Simulations show the enhanced UGLMS reconstructs full Integral- and Differential-Non-Linearity (INL/DNL) in just 36 ms for 16-bit and under 70 ms for 18-bit ADCs (120 ms with the polynomial extension). Combining the faster convergence from covariance inflation with reduced per-iteration runtime from the rank-1 EKF update, the method reaches equal accuracy 8x faster for 16-bit ADCs.

Existing video generation models are predominantly based on the video diffusion transformer (vDiT), however, they suffer from substantial inference delay due to self-attention. While prior studies have focused on reducing redundant computations in self-attention, they often overlook the inherent spatio-temporal correlations in video streams and directly leverage sparsity patterns from large language models to reduce attention computations.\n  In this work, we take a principled approach to accelerate self-attention in vDiTs by leveraging the spatio-temporal correlations in the latent space. We show that the attention patterns within vDiT are primarily due to the dominant spatial and temporal correlations at the token channel level. Based on this insight, we propose a lightweight and adaptive reuse strategy that approximates attention computations by reusing partial attention scores of spatially or temporally correlated tokens along individual channels. We demonstrate that our method achieves significantly higher computational savings (85\\%) compared to state-of-the-art techniques over 4 vDiTs, while preserving almost identical video quality ($<$0.06\\% loss on VBench).", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u65f6\u7a7a\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u7684\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u91cd\u7528\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u91cd\u7528\u7a7a\u95f4\u6216\u65f6\u95f4\u76f8\u5173token\u7684\u90e8\u5206\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5206\u6570\u6765\u52a0\u901f\u89c6\u9891\u6269\u6563\u53d8\u6362\u5668\u4e2d\u7684\u81ea\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b085%\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u8282\u7701\u4e14\u89c6\u9891\u8d28\u91cf\u635f\u5931\u6781\u5c0f\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u4e3b\u8981\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c6\u9891\u6269\u6563\u53d8\u6362\u5668(vDiT)\uff0c\u4f46\u7531\u4e8e\u81ea\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u5bfc\u81f4\u63a8\u7406\u5ef6\u8fdf\u4e25\u91cd\u3002\u5148\u524d\u7814\u7a76\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u51cf\u5c11\u81ea\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u4e2d\u7684\u5197\u4f59\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u4f46\u5ffd\u89c6\u4e86\u89c6\u9891\u6d41\u4e2d\u56fa\u6709\u7684\u65f6\u7a7a\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u7684\u65f6\u7a7a\u76f8\u5173\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u91cd\u7528\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u91cd\u7528\u7a7a\u95f4\u6216\u65f6\u95f4\u76f8\u5173token\u5728\u5355\u4e2a\u901a\u9053\u4e0a\u7684\u90e8\u5206\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5206\u6570\u6765\u8fd1\u4f3c\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u8ba1\u7b97\u3002", "result": "\u57284\u4e2avDiT\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u76f8\u6bd4\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u6280\u672f\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u8282\u7701(85%)\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u51e0\u4e4e\u76f8\u540c\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u8d28\u91cf(VBench\u4e0a\u635f\u5931<0.06%)\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u5229\u7528\u89c6\u9891\u4e2d\u7684\u65f6\u7a7a\u76f8\u5173\u6027\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u52a0\u901f\u4e86vDiT\u4e2d\u7684\u81ea\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u89c6\u9891\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u5927\u5e45\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u3002"}}

They alleviate power and latency bottlenecks caused by extensive data movements between compute and storage units. This work proposes a digital CIM macro to compute Transformer attention. To mitigate dynamic matrix multiplication that is unsuitable for the common weight-stationary CIM paradigm, we reformulate the attention score computation process based on a combined QK-weight matrix, so that inputs can be directly fed to CIM cells to obtain the score results. Moreover, the involved binomial matrix multiplication operation is decomposed into 4 groups of bit-serial shifting and additions, without costly physical multipliers in the CIM. We maximize the energy efficiency of the CIM circuit through zero-value bit-skipping, data-driven word line activation, read-write separate 6T cells and bit-alternating 14T/28T adders. The proposed CIM macro was implemented using a 65-nm process. It occupied only 0.35 mm2 area, and delivered a 42.27 GOPS peak performance with 1.24 mW power consumption at a 1.0 V power supply and a 100 MHz clock frequency, resulting in 34.1 TOPS/W energy efficiency and 120.77 GOPS/mm2 area efficiency. When compared to the CPU and GPU, our CIM macro is 25x and 13x more energy efficient on practical tasks, respectively.

Existing research enhances GNN co-inference by leveraging offline model splitting and pipeline parallelism (PP), which enables more efficient computation and resource utilization during inference. However, the performance of these static deployment methods is significantly affected by environmental dynamics such as network fluctuations and multi-device access, which remain unaddressed. We present ACE-GNN, the first Adaptive GNN Co-inference framework tailored for dynamic Edge environments, to boost system performance and stability. ACE-GNN achieves performance awareness for complex multi-device access edge systems via system-level abstraction and two novel prediction methods, enabling rapid runtime scheme optimization. Moreover, we introduce a data parallelism (DP) mechanism in the runtime optimization space, enabling adaptive scheduling between PP and DP to leverage their distinct advantages and maintain stable system performance. Also, an efficient batch inference strategy and specialized communication middleware are implemented to further improve performance.

The method combines uniform geometric coarsening of the underlying grid with heterogeneous coarse-grid operators: Galerkin coarse grid approximation is applied locally in regions with large coefficient gradients, while lightweight, direct coarse grid approximation is used elsewhere. This selective application ensures that local Galerkin operators are computed and stored only where necessary, minimizing memory requirements while maintaining robust convergence. We demonstrate the method on a suite of sinker benchmark problems for the generalized Stokes equation, including grid-aligned and unaligned viscosity jumps, smoothly varying viscosity functions with large gradients, and different viscosity evaluation techniques.

Inference, particularly the decoding phase, is dominated by memory-bound GEMV or flat GEMM operations with low operational intensity (OI), making it well-suited for processing-in-memory (PIM) approaches. However, existing in/near-memory solutions face critical limitations such as reduced memory capacity due to the high area cost of integrating processing elements (PEs) within DRAM chips, and limited PE capability due to the constraints of DRAM fabrication technology. This work presents a chiplet-based memory module that addresses these limitations by decoupling logic and memory into chiplets fabricated in heterogeneous technology nodes and connected via an interposer. The logic chiplets sustain high bandwidth access to the DRAM chiplets, which house the memory banks, and enable the integration of advanced processing components such as systolic arrays and SRAM-based buffers to accelerate memory-bound GEMM kernels, capabilities that were not feasible in prior PIM architectures. We propose Sangam, a CXL-attached PIM-chiplet based memory module that can either act as a drop-in replacement for GPUs or co-executes along side the GPUs. Sangam achieves speedup of 3.93, 4.22, 2.82x speedup in end-to-end query latency, 10.3, 9.5, 6.36x greater decoding throughput, and order of magnitude energy savings compared to an H100 GPU for varying input size, output length, and batch size on LLaMA 2-7B, Mistral-7B, and LLaMA 3-70B, respectively.", "AI": {"tldr": "Sangam\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8eCXL\u8fde\u63a5\u7684PIM-chiplet\u5185\u5b58\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u903b\u8f91\u548c\u5185\u5b58\u5206\u79bb\u5230\u4e0d\u540c\u5de5\u827a\u8282\u70b9\u7684chiplet\u4e2d\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u5185\u5b58\u8ba1\u7b97\u65b9\u6848\u7684\u5bb9\u91cf\u548c\u5904\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u52a0\u901f\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u53d8\u5f97\u8d8a\u6765\u8d8a\u6570\u636e\u5bc6\u96c6\uff0c\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7279\u522b\u662f\u89e3\u7801\u9636\u6bb5\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u5185\u5b58\u5e26\u5bbd\uff0c\u800c\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u5185\u5b58\u8ba1\u7b97\u65b9\u6848\u9762\u4e34\u5185\u5b58\u5bb9\u91cf\u51cf\u5c11\u548c\u5904\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u6709\u9650\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fachiplet\u67b6\u6784\u7684\u5185\u5b58\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u5c06\u903b\u8f91\u548cDRAM\u5206\u79bb\u5230\u4e0d\u540c\u5de5\u827a\u8282\u70b9\u7684chiplet\u4e2d\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e2d\u4ecb\u5c42\u8fde\u63a5\uff0c\u903b\u8f91chiplet\u5305\u542b\u8109\u52a8\u9635\u5217\u548cSRAM\u7f13\u51b2\u5668\u6765\u52a0\u901f\u5185\u5b58\u5bc6\u96c6\u578bGEMM\u8fd0\u7b97\u3002", "result": "\u76f8\u6bd4H100 GPU\uff0c\u5728LLaMA 2-7B\u3001Mistral-7B\u548cLLaMA 3-70B\u4e0a\uff0c\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u67e5\u8be2\u5ef6\u8fdf\u5206\u522b\u63d0\u53473.93\u30014.22\u30012.82\u500d\uff0c\u89e3\u7801\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u5206\u522b\u63d0\u534710.3\u30019.5\u30016.36\u500d\uff0c\u80fd\u8017\u8282\u7701\u4e00\u4e2a\u6570\u91cf\u7ea7\u3002", "conclusion": "Sangam\u67b6\u6784\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709PIM\u65b9\u6848\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u3001\u9ad8\u80fd\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u53ef\u4f5c\u4e3aGPU\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u6216\u534f\u540c\u6267\u884c\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

We show how to use them to solve Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) explicitly discretized on a computational stencil. From this point of view, the QPU serves as a sampling accelerator. Each micro-kernel consumes only stencil inputs (neighbor values and coefficients), runs a shallow parameterized circuit, and reports the sample mean of a readout rule. The resource footprint in qubits and depth is fixed and independent of the global grid. This makes micro-kernels easy to orchestrate from a classical host and to parallelize across grid points. We present two realizations. The Bernoulli micro-kernel targets convex-sum stencils by encoding values as single-qubit probabilities with shot allocation proportional to stencil weights. The branching micro-kernel prepares a selector over stencil branches and applies addressed rotations to a single readout qubit. In contrast to monolithic quantum PDE solvers that encode the full space-time problem in one deep circuit, our approach keeps the classical time loop and offloads only local updates. Batching and in-circuit fusion amortize submission and readout overheads. We test and validate the QPU micro-kernel method on two PDEs commonly arising in scientific computing: the Heat and viscous Burgers' equations. On noiseless quantum circuit simulators, accuracy improves as the number of samples increases.

Traditional centralized algorithms, such as Dijkstra's, are computationally intensive and ill-suited for dynamic, distributed IoT environments. We propose a novel distributed Q-learning framework for constructing shortest-path trees (SPTs), enabling sensor nodes to independently learn optimal next-hop decisions using only local information. States are defined based on node positions and routing history, with a reward function that incentivizes progression toward the sink while penalizing inefficient paths. Trained on diverse network topologies, the framework generalizes effectively to unseen networks. Simulations across 100 to 500 nodes demonstrate near-optimal routing accuracy (over 99% for networks with more than 300 nodes), with minor deviations (1-2 extra hops) in smaller networks having negligible impact on performance. Compared to centralized and flooding-based methods, our approach reduces communication overhead, adapts to topology changes, and enhances scalability and energy efficiency.

Knowledge Distillation (KD) where a LLM \"teacher\" trains a smaller and more efficient \"student\" model, offers a promising solution to this problem. However, the distillation process itself often remains costly for large datasets, since it requires the teacher to label a vast number of samples while incurring significant token consumption. To alleviate this challenge, in this work we explore the active learning (AL) as a way to create efficient student models at a fraction of the cost while preserving the LLM's performance. In particular, we introduce M-RARU (Multi-class Randomized Accept/Reject Uncertainty Sampling), a novel AL algorithm that significantly reduces training costs. M-RARU employs an innovative strategy combining uncertainty with a randomized accept-reject mechanism to select only the most informative data points for the LLM teacher. This focused approach significantly minimizes required API calls and data processing time. We evaluate M-RARU against random sampling across five diverse student models (SVM, LDA, RF, GBDT, and DistilBERT) on multiple benchmark datasets.

As a result, high-end processors typically feature lower memory bandwidth per core, at the detriment of memory-intensive workloads. We propose alleviating this challenge by improving the utility of the CPU's limited pins. In a typical CPU design process, the available pins are apportioned between memory and I/O traffic, each accounting for about half of the total off-chip bandwidth availability. Consequently, unless both memory and I/O are simultaneously highly utilized, such fragmentation leads to underutilization of the valuable off-chip bandwidth resources. An ideal architecture would offer I/O and memory bandwidth fungibility, allowing use of the aggregate off-chip bandwidth in the form required by each workload.\n  In this work, we introduce SURGE, a software-supported architectural technique that boosts memory bandwidth availability by salvaging idle I/O bandwidth resources.

However, the hardware overhead caused by exponent comparison and mantissa alignment, along with the delay introduced by bit-serial input methods, remains a hinder to implement FP-MAC efficiently. In view of this, we propose Segmented Exponent Alignment (SEA) and Dynamic Wordline Activation (DWA) strategies. SEA exploits the observation that input exponents are often clustered around zero or within a narrow range. By segmenting the exponent space and aligning mantissas accordingly, SEA eliminates the need for maximum exponent detection and reduces input mantissa shifting, and thus reduces the processing latency. DWA further reduces latency and maintains accuracy by activating wordlines based on the exponent segments defined by SEA. Simulation results demonstrate that, when compared with conventional comparison tree based maximum exponent alignment method, our approach saves 63.8\\% power consumption, and achieves a 40.87\\% delay reduction on the VGG16-CIFAR10 benchmark.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86SEA\u548cDWA\u7b56\u7565\u6765\u4f18\u5316FP-MAC\u64cd\u4f5c\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6bb5\u6307\u6570\u5bf9\u9f50\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u5b57\u7ebf\u6fc0\u6d3b\u51cf\u5c11\u5ef6\u8fdf\u548c\u529f\u8017", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edfFP-MAC\u64cd\u4f5c\u4e2d\u7684\u6307\u6570\u6bd4\u8f83\u548c\u5c3e\u6570\u5bf9\u9f50\u5bfc\u81f4\u786c\u4ef6\u5f00\u9500\u5927\uff0c\u4f4d\u4e32\u884c\u8f93\u5165\u65b9\u6cd5\u5f15\u5165\u5ef6\u8fdf\uff0c\u963b\u788d\u9ad8\u6548\u5b9e\u73b0", "method": "SEA\u7b56\u7565\u5229\u7528\u8f93\u5165\u6307\u6570\u901a\u5e38\u96c6\u4e2d\u5728\u96f6\u9644\u8fd1\u6216\u72ed\u7a84\u8303\u56f4\u5185\u7684\u89c2\u5bdf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6bb5\u6307\u6570\u7a7a\u95f4\u548c\u76f8\u5e94\u5c3e\u6570\u5bf9\u9f50\u6765\u6d88\u9664\u6700\u5927\u6307\u6570\u68c0\u6d4b\u9700\u6c42\uff1bDWA\u7b56\u7565\u57fa\u4e8eSEA\u5b9a\u4e49\u7684\u6307\u6570\u6bb5\u6765\u6fc0\u6d3b\u5b57\u7ebf", "result": "\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u6bd4\u8f83\u6811\u6700\u5927\u6307\u6570\u5bf9\u9f50\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u5728VGG16-CIFAR10\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8282\u770163.8%\u529f\u8017\uff0c\u5ef6\u8fdf\u964d\u4f4e40.87%", "conclusion": "SEA\u548cDWA\u7b56\u7565\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u964d\u4f4eFP-MAC\u64cd\u4f5c\u7684\u5ef6\u8fdf\u548c\u529f\u8017\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387"}}

This paper presents the first empirical study investigating divergence in machine learning model across heterogeneous AI accelerators. Utilizing an automated pipeline, we synthesize over 100,000 variant models derived from 4,000 real-world models and execute them across five different enterprise-grade accelerators. Our findings suggest that newer AI platforms from Mac and Huawei support at least 17\\% fewer operators than NVIDIA. These platforms also exhibit a higher rate of output discrepancies (exceeding 5\\%), which stem from differences in operator implementations, handling of exceptional numerical values, and instruction scheduling. They are also more susceptible to failures during model compilation-based acceleration, and in some cases, the compiled models produce outputs that differ noticeably from those generated using the standard execution mode. In addition, we identify 7 implementation flaws in PyTorch and 40 platform-specific issues across vendors.

The increasing popularity of algorithmic decision-making has stimulated interest in algorithmic fairness within the academic community. Researchers have introduced various fairness definitions that quantify disparities between privileged and protected groups, use causal inference to determine the impact of race on model predictions, and that test calibration of probability predictions from the model. Existing literature does not provide a way in which to assess whether observed disparities between groups are statistically significant or merely due to chance. This paper introduces a rigorous framework for testing the statistical significance of fairness violations by leveraging k-fold cross-validation [2] to generate sampling distributions of fairness metrics. This paper introduces statistical tests that can be used to identify statistically significant violations of fairness metrics based on disparities between predicted and actual outcomes, model calibration, and causal inference techniques [1]. We demonstrate this approach by testing recidivism forecasting algorithms trained on data from the National Institute of Justice. Our findings reveal that machine learning algorithms used for recidivism forecasting exhibit statistically significant bias against Black individuals under several fairness definitions, while also exhibiting no bias or bias against White individuals under other definitions.

The proposed 9T XNOR-based RX9T bit-cell integrates a 5T storage cell with a 4T XNOR compute unit, enabling variable-precision MAC and CAM operations within the same array. A 22-transistor (C22T) compressor-tree-based accumulator facilitates logarithmic 1-64-bit MAC computation with reduced delay and power compared to conventional adder trees.

These laws and policies serve essential functions for citizens. Such as granting them certain rights or imposing specific obligations. However, these documents are often lengthy, complex, and difficult to navigate, making it challenging for citizens to locate and understand relevant information. This work presents PolicyBot, a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) system designed to answer user queries over policy documents with a focus on transparency and reproducibility. The system combines domain-specific semantic chunking, multilingual dense embeddings, multi-stage retrieval with reranking, and source-aware generation to provide responses grounded in the original documents. We implemented citation tracing to reduce hallucinations and improve user trust, and evaluated alternative retrieval and generation configurations to identify effective design choices. The end-to-end pipeline is built entirely with open-source tools, enabling easy adaptation to other domains requiring document-grounded question answering.

Traditional heuristic approaches prove inadequate for handling the multi-objective optimization demands of existing cloud infrastructures. This paper presents a comparative analysis of state-of-the-art artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms for resource allocation. We systematically evaluate 10 algorithms across four categories: Deep Reinforcement Learning approaches, Neural Network architectures, Traditional Machine Learning enhanced methods, and Multi-Agent systems. Analysis of published results demonstrates significant performance improvements across multiple metrics including makespan reduction, cost optimization, and energy efficiency gains compared to traditional methods. The findings reveal that hybrid architectures combining multiple artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques consistently outperform single-method approaches, with edge computing environments showing the highest deployment readiness.

We then use this greedy solution as the starting point for a simulated annealing local search: we attempt vertex removals and exchanges and accept worsening moves with decaying probability, in order to escape local minima while preserving domination.\n  Our best-performing component, which we ultimately submitted, is \\texttt{hedom5}. The design of \\texttt{hedom5} is inspired by recent iterative-greedy style domination heuristics~\\cite{IterativeGreedy22} that alternate between constructive steps, pruning, and focused repair rather than relying on a single pass. In \\texttt{hedom5}, the input graph is first stored in a compact CSR structure and simplified using fast reductions such as forcing neighbors of leaves and handling isolates. We then run a lazy gain-based greedy stage using a priority queue: each candidate vertex is scored by how many currently undominated vertices its closed neighborhood would newly dominate, and scores are only recomputed when necessary. After this constructive phase, we perform an aggressive backward pruning pass that iterates over the chosen dominators in reverse insertion order and deletes any vertex whose closed neighborhood is still fully dominated by the remaining set. Finally, we run a budgeted 1-swap local improvement step that attempts to replace a dominator by an alternative vertex that covers all of its uniquely covered vertices, thereby reducing the size of the dominating set. A brief safety patch at the end guarantees full domination.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86\u7528\u4e8ePACE 2025\u7ade\u8d5b\u6700\u5c0f\u652f\u914d\u96c6\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u8d5b\u9053\u7684twin_width_fmi\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u8d2a\u5fc3\u7b97\u6cd5\u3001\u6a21\u62df\u9000\u706b\u5c40\u90e8\u641c\u7d22\u548c\u6700\u7ec8\u63d0\u4ea4\u7684hedom5\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f00\u53d1\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u7b97\u6cd5\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u6700\u5c0f\u652f\u914d\u96c6\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u53c2\u4e0ePACE 2025\u7ade\u8d5b\u7684\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u8d5b\u9053\u3002", "method": "1. \u8d2a\u5fc3\u7b97\u6cd5greedy-ln\u4f5c\u4e3a\u57fa\u7ebf\uff1b2. \u6a21\u62df\u9000\u706b\u5c40\u90e8\u641c\u7d22\uff1b3. hedom5\u7b97\u6cd5\uff1a\u5305\u542b\u56fe\u7b80\u5316\u3001\u57fa\u4e8e\u589e\u76ca\u7684\u61d2\u66f4\u65b0\u8d2a\u5fc3\u6784\u9020\u3001\u53cd\u5411\u4fee\u526a\u548c1-\u4ea4\u6362\u5c40\u90e8\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "result": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86hedom5\u7b97\u6cd5\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6700\u7ec8\u63d0\u4ea4\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u8be5\u7b97\u6cd5\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u591a\u79cd\u6280\u672f\u6765\u83b7\u5f97\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u6700\u5c0f\u652f\u914d\u96c6\u89e3\u3002", "conclusion": "hedom5\u7b97\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u8fed\u4ee3\u5f0f\u8d2a\u5fc3\u6784\u9020\u3001\u79ef\u6781\u4fee\u526a\u548c\u5c40\u90e8\u6539\u8fdb\u7684\u7ec4\u5408\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u6c42\u89e3\u6700\u5c0f\u652f\u914d\u96c6\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u7ade\u8d5b\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\u3002"}}

In Transformers, positional information is typically encoded using Positional Encodings (PEs). One such popular PE, namely Rotary PE (RoPE), has been widely used due to its empirical success. Recently, it has been argued that part of RoPE's success emerges from its ability to encode robust positional and semantic information using large and small frequencies, respectively. In this work, we perform a deeper dive into the positional versus symbolic dichotomy of attention heads behavior, both at the theoretical and empirical level. We provide general definitions of what it means for a head to behave positionally or symbolically, prove that these are two mutually exclusive behaviors and develop a metric to quantify them. We apply our framework to analyze Transformer-based LLMs using RoPE and find that all heads exhibit a strong correspondence between behavior and frequency use. Finally, we introduce canonical tasks designed to be either purely positional or symbolic, and demonstrate that the Transformer performance causally relates to the ability of attention heads to leverage the appropriate frequencies. In particular, we show that we can control the Transformer performance by controlling which frequencies the attention heads can access. Altogether, our work provides a detailed understanding of RoPE, and how its properties relate to model behavior.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u6df1\u5165\u5206\u6790\u4e86Transformer\u4e2dRoPE\u4f4d\u7f6e\u7f16\u7801\u7684\u4f4d\u7f6e\u4fe1\u606f\u4e0e\u7b26\u53f7\u4fe1\u606f\u7f16\u7801\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u91cf\u5316\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5934\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u53ef\u4ee5\u901a\u8fc7\u63a7\u5236\u9891\u7387\u8bbf\u95ee\u6765\u8c03\u63a7\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u7406\u89e3RoPE\u4f4d\u7f6e\u7f16\u7801\u6210\u529f\u7684\u539f\u56e0\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5176\u5982\u4f55\u5206\u522b\u4f7f\u7528\u5927\u9891\u7387\u548c\u5c0f\u9891\u7387\u6765\u7f16\u7801\u4f4d\u7f6e\u4fe1\u606f\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5934\u5728\u8fd9\u4e24\u79cd\u884c\u4e3a\u4e0a\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4f4d\u7f6e\u884c\u4e3a\u548c\u7b26\u53f7\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u901a\u7528\u5b9a\u4e49\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u8fd9\u4e24\u79cd\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u4e92\u65a5\u6027\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u91cf\u5316\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u4f7f\u7528RoPE\u7684Transformer LLMs\u4e0a\u5e94\u7528\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u7eaf\u4f4d\u7f6e\u548c\u7eaf\u7b26\u53f7\u7684\u89c4\u8303\u4efb\u52a1\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u6240\u6709\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5934\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u4e0e\u9891\u7387\u4f7f\u7528\u4e4b\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u5f3a\u76f8\u5173\u6027\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u901a\u8fc7\u63a7\u5236\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5934\u53ef\u8bbf\u95ee\u7684\u9891\u7387\u6765\u56e0\u679c\u6027\u5730\u63a7\u5236Transformer\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5bf9RoPE\u7684\u8be6\u7ec6\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u9610\u660e\u4e86\u5176\u7279\u6027\u4e0e\u6a21\u578b\u884c\u4e3a\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u4e3a\u4f4d\u7f6e\u7f16\u7801\u673a\u5236\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u548c\u7406\u89e3\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

Our core objective is to empirically determine the combination that achieves the best trade-off between minimal accuracy degradation and maximal inference speed-up.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86Android\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e0aAI\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u6267\u884c\u914d\u7f6e\uff0c\u91cd\u70b9\u5173\u6ce8\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0d\u540c\u91cf\u5316\u65b9\u6848\u548c\u8bbe\u5907\u52a0\u901f\u5668\u6765\u5e73\u8861\u7cbe\u5ea6\u635f\u5931\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u901f\u5ea6", "motivation": "\u79fb\u52a8AI\u5e94\u7528\u9700\u8981\u4f4e\u5ef6\u8fdf\u548c\u9ad8\u54cd\u5e94\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u9762\u4e34\u7740\u5b9e\u65f6\u7ea6\u675f\u548c\u5f02\u6784\u786c\u4ef6\u67b6\u6784\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u627e\u5230\u6700\u4f18\u7684\u6267\u884c\u914d\u7f6e", "method": "\u8bc4\u4f30YOLO\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u548cResNet\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u7c7b\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4e0d\u540c\u91cf\u5316\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u4ee5\u53caGPU\u548cNPU\u7b49\u8bbe\u5907\u52a0\u901f\u5668\u7684\u4f7f\u7528", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u786e\u5b9a\u4e86\u5728\u7cbe\u5ea6\u635f\u5931\u6700\u5c0f\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u901f\u5ea6\u63d0\u5347\u6700\u5927\u4e4b\u95f4\u8fbe\u5230\u6700\u4f73\u5e73\u8861\u7684\u914d\u7f6e\u7ec4\u5408", "conclusion": "\u627e\u5230\u4e86Android\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e0aAI\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u6267\u884c\u914d\u7f6e\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u901f\u5ea6\u7684\u826f\u597d\u6743\u8861"}}

The problem is exacerbated in autoregressive (AR) LLM inference, where per-token forward passes repeatedly generate bulky intermediate features (IFs). We introduce SLICER, a retraining-free, architecture-agnostic framework that compresses IFs to reduce both communication and server load in split computing. SLICER combines (i) asymmetric top-K filtering (ATKF) to sparsify low-magnitude activations, (ii) magnitude-splitting (MS) to group the remaining non-zeros into equal-cardinality blocks, and (iii) adaptive bit quantization (ABQ) that selects per-block bitwidths under a distortion budget. Across standard vision and LLM workloads (e.g., ImageNet/COCO; HellaSwag, PIQA, ARC-E/C, GSM8K, HumanEval), SLICER reduces uplink volume by up to 10x and server GPU time by up to 4.4x, while keeping task quality within ~0-3 pp of baseline. In multi-device settings and AR LLMs, SLICER scales by shifting meaningful compute to the edge and lowering bits-per-token and server time per token, stabilizing per-step traffic. The codec attaches to off-the-shelf models without retraining or architectural changes, offering a plug-and-play path to scalable, low-latency distributed inference.

However, existing solutions struggle to achieve high frame rates, especially for high-resolution rendering. Our analysis identifies the sorting stage in the 3DGS rendering pipeline as the major bottleneck due to its high memory bandwidth demand. This paper presents Neo, which introduces a reuse-and-update sorting algorithm that exploits temporal redundancy in Gaussian ordering across consecutive frames, and devises a hardware accelerator optimized for this algorithm. By efficiently tracking and updating Gaussian depth ordering instead of re-sorting from scratch, Neo significantly reduces redundant computations and memory bandwidth pressure. Experimental results show that Neo achieves up to 10.0x and 5.6x higher throughput than state-of-the-art edge GPU and ASIC solution, respectively, while reducing DRAM traffic by 94.5% and 81.3%. These improvements make high-quality and low-latency on-device 3D rendering more practical.", "AI": {"tldr": "Neo\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u91cd\u7528\u548c\u66f4\u65b0\u7684\u6392\u5e8f\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u8fde\u7eed\u5e27\u95f4\u9ad8\u65af\u6392\u5e8f\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u5197\u4f59\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u9488\u5bf9\u8be5\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u786c\u4ef6\u52a0\u901f\u5668\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e863D\u9ad8\u65af\u6e85\u5c04\u5728\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u8bbe\u5907\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u65f6\u6e32\u67d3\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u8bbe\u5907\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b03D\u9ad8\u65af\u6e85\u5c04(3DGS)\u7684\u5b9e\u65f6\u6e32\u67d3\u5bf9\u4e8e\u63d0\u4f9b\u6c89\u6d78\u5f0fAR/VR\u4f53\u9a8c\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u96be\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u5e27\u7387\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u6e32\u67d3\u65f6\u3002\u5206\u6790\u53d1\u73b0\u6e32\u67d3\u7ba1\u9053\u4e2d\u7684\u6392\u5e8f\u9636\u6bb5\u662f\u4e3b\u8981\u74f6\u9888\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u91cd\u7528\u548c\u66f4\u65b0\u6392\u5e8f\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u8fde\u7eed\u5e27\u95f4\u9ad8\u65af\u6392\u5e8f\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u5197\u4f59\u6027\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8ddf\u8e2a\u548c\u66f4\u65b0\u9ad8\u65af\u6df1\u5ea6\u6392\u5e8f\u800c\u4e0d\u662f\u4ece\u5934\u91cd\u65b0\u6392\u5e8f\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u5197\u4f59\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u5185\u5b58\u5e26\u5bbd\u538b\u529b\uff0c\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u9488\u5bf9\u8be5\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u786c\u4ef6\u52a0\u901f\u5668\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0cNeo\u6bd4\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u8fb9\u7f18GPU\u548cASIC\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u5206\u522b\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e8610.0\u500d\u548c5.6\u500d\u7684\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5c06DRAM\u6d41\u91cf\u51cf\u5c11\u4e8694.5%\u548c81.3%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6539\u8fdb\u4f7f\u5f97\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u3001\u4f4e\u5ef6\u8fdf\u7684\u8bbe\u5907\u7aef3D\u6e32\u67d3\u66f4\u52a0\u5b9e\u7528\u53ef\u884c\u3002"}}

This study evaluates twenty-one publicly available LLMs on a representative heterogeneous high-performance computing (HPC) workload mapping and scheduling problem. Each model received the same textual description of system nodes, task requirements, and scheduling constraints, and was required to assign tasks to nodes, compute the total makespan, and explain its reasoning. A manually derived analytical optimum of nine hours and twenty seconds served as the ground truth reference. Three models exactly reproduced the analytical optimum while satisfying all constraints, twelve achieved near-optimal results within two minutes of the reference, and six produced suboptimal schedules with arithmetic or dependency errors. All models generated feasible task-to-node mappings, though only about half maintained strict constraint adherence. Nineteen models produced partially executable verification code, and eighteen provided coherent step-by-step reasoning, demonstrating strong interpretability even when logical errors occurred. Overall, the results define the current capability boundary of LLM reasoning in combinatorial optimization: leading models can reconstruct optimal schedules directly from natural language, but most still struggle with precise timing, data transfer arithmetic, and dependency enforcement. These findings highlight the potential of LLMs as explainable co-pilots for optimization and decision-support tasks rather than autonomous solvers.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bc4\u4f3021\u4e2a\u516c\u5f00LLM\u5728HPC\u5de5\u4f5c\u8d1f\u8f7d\u8c03\u5ea6\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u53d1\u73b03\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u7cbe\u786e\u91cd\u73b0\u6700\u4f18\u89e3\uff0c12\u4e2a\u63a5\u8fd1\u6700\u4f18\uff0c6\u4e2a\u8868\u73b0\u6b21\u4f18\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86LLM\u5728\u7ec4\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u4e2d\u7684\u5f53\u524d\u80fd\u529b\u8fb9\u754c\u3002", "motivation": "\u7406\u89e3LLM\u5728\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u3001\u57fa\u4e8e\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u4e2d\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u4ece\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u63cf\u8ff0\u4e2d\u89e3\u51b3\u7ec4\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u76f8\u540c\u7684\u6587\u672c\u63cf\u8ff0\uff08\u7cfb\u7edf\u8282\u70b9\u3001\u4efb\u52a1\u9700\u6c42\u3001\u8c03\u5ea6\u7ea6\u675f\uff09\u6d4b\u8bd521\u4e2aLLM\uff0c\u8981\u6c42\u5206\u914d\u4efb\u52a1\u5230\u8282\u70b9\u3001\u8ba1\u7b97\u603b\u5b8c\u6210\u65f6\u95f4\u5e76\u89e3\u91ca\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u4ee5\u624b\u52a8\u63a8\u5bfc\u76849\u5c0f\u65f620\u79d2\u6700\u4f18\u89e3\u4e3a\u57fa\u51c6\u3002", "result": "3\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\u7cbe\u786e\u91cd\u73b0\u6700\u4f18\u89e3\uff0c12\u4e2a\u57282\u5206\u949f\u5185\u63a5\u8fd1\u6700\u4f18\uff0c6\u4e2a\u4ea7\u751f\u6b21\u4f18\u8c03\u5ea6\uff08\u7b97\u672f\u6216\u4f9d\u8d56\u9519\u8bef\uff09\uff1b\u6240\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u53ef\u884c\u4efb\u52a1\u6620\u5c04\uff0c\u4f46\u4ec5\u7ea6\u4e00\u534a\u4e25\u683c\u9075\u5faa\u7ea6\u675f\uff1b19\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u90e8\u5206\u53ef\u6267\u884c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4ee3\u7801\uff0c18\u4e2a\u63d0\u4f9b\u8fde\u8d2f\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9886\u5148\u7684LLM\u80fd\u4ece\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u76f4\u63a5\u91cd\u6784\u6700\u4f18\u8c03\u5ea6\uff0c\u4f46\u5927\u591a\u6570\u4ecd\u96be\u4ee5\u5904\u7406\u7cbe\u786e\u8ba1\u65f6\u3001\u6570\u636e\u4f20\u8f93\u7b97\u672f\u548c\u4f9d\u8d56\u6267\u884c\uff1bLLM\u66f4\u9002\u5408\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4f18\u5316\u548c\u51b3\u7b56\u652f\u6301\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u8f85\u52a9\u5de5\u5177\u800c\u975e\u81ea\u4e3b\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u3002"}}

This paper introduces RAG-FLARKO, a retrieval-augmented extension to FLARKO, that overcomes scalability and relevance challenges using multi-stage and parallel KG retrieval processes. Our method first retrieves behaviorally relevant entities from a user's transaction KG and then uses this context to filter temporally consistent signals from a market KG, constructing a compact, grounded subgraph for the LLM. This pipeline reduces context overhead and sharpens the model's focus on relevant information.

However, challenges remain in ensuring the quality of Verilog generation. Complex designs often fail in a single generation due to the lack of targeted decoupling strategies, and evaluating the correctness of decoupled sub-tasks remains difficult. While the chain-of-thought (CoT) method is commonly used to improve LLM reasoning, it has been largely ineffective in automating IC design workflows, requiring manual intervention. The key issue is controlling CoT reasoning direction and step granularity, which do not align with expert RTL design knowledge. This paper introduces VeriBToT, a specialized LLM reasoning paradigm for automated Verilog generation. By integrating Top-down and design-for-verification (DFV) approaches, VeriBToT achieves self-decoupling and self-verification of intermediate steps, constructing a Backtrack Tree of Thought with formal operators. Compared to traditional CoT paradigms, our approach enhances Verilog generation while optimizing token costs through flexible modularity, hierarchy, and reusability.", "AI": {"tldr": "VeriBToT\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u4e13\u95e8\u7528\u4e8e\u81ea\u52a8Verilog\u751f\u6210\u7684LLM\u63a8\u7406\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u96c6\u6210\u81ea\u4e0a\u800c\u4e0b\u548c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u9a8c\u8bc1\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e2d\u95f4\u6b65\u9aa4\u7684\u81ea\u89e3\u8026\u548c\u81ea\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u5e26\u6709\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u64cd\u4f5c\u7684\u56de\u6eaf\u601d\u7ef4\u6811\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u5728\u96c6\u6210\u7535\u8def\u5de5\u7a0b\u4e2d\u4f7f\u7528LLM\u81ea\u52a8\u751f\u6210Verilog\u65f6\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4f20\u7edfCoT\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u63a7\u5236\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u5411\u548c\u6b65\u9aa4\u7c92\u5ea6\u65b9\u9762\u4e0e\u4e13\u5bb6RTL\u8bbe\u8ba1\u77e5\u8bc6\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u624b\u52a8\u5e72\u9884\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faVeriBToT\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u96c6\u6210\u81ea\u4e0a\u800c\u4e0b\u548c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u9a8c\u8bc1\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u81ea\u89e3\u8026\u548c\u81ea\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u56de\u6eaf\u601d\u7ef4\u6811\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u64cd\u4f5c\u7b26\u3002", "result": "\u76f8\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edfCoT\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u5347\u4e86Verilog\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u901a\u8fc7\u7075\u6d3b\u7684\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u3001\u5c42\u6b21\u5316\u548c\u53ef\u91cd\u7528\u6027\u4f18\u5316\u4e86token\u6210\u672c\u3002", "conclusion": "VeriBToT\u4e3a\u81ea\u52a8\u5316IC\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7a0b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u7684LLM\u63a8\u7406\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728Verilog\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002"}}

Their ability to implement parallel pipelines for convolutions, attention mechanisms, and post-processing with deterministic timing and reduced power consumption makes them a strategic option for workloads that demand predictable performance and deep customization.\n  Unlike CPUs and GPUs, whose architecture is immutable, an FPGA can be reconfigured in the field to adapt its physical structure to a specific model, integrate as a SoC with embedded processors, and run inference near the sensor without sending raw data to the cloud.

They proposed to keep CoTs monitorable by training only against output monitors that do not have access to CoT. We show that such training can still cause obfuscated CoTs via two mechanisms. First, when a model is trained to produce a safe-looking output, that model may generalize to making its CoTs look safe. Second, since later tokens are conditioned on earlier ones, safe-looking CoTs may increase the likelihood of safe outputs, causing safe-looking CoTs to be reinforced.

As weathering depends on many factors, it is also difficult to link its progression to climatic changes. To predict weathering, it is essential to gather climatic data while simultaneously monitoring the progression of deterioration. The multimodal nature of collected data (images, text{\\ldots}) makes correlations difficult, particularly on different time scales. To address this issue, the COLISEUM project proposes a methodology for collecting data in three French sites to predict heritage material behaviour using artificial intelligence computer models. Over time, prediction models will allow the prediction of future material behaviours using known data from different climate change scenarios by the IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change). Thus, a climate monitoring methodology has been set up in three cultural sites in France: Notre-Dame cathedral in Strasbourg ( 67), Bibracte archaeological site (71), and the Saint-Pierre chapel in Villefranche-sur-Mer (06). Each site has a different climate and specific materials. In situ, microclimatic sensors continuously record variations parameters over time. The state of alteration is monitored at regular intervals by means of chemical analyses, cartographic measurements and scientific imaging campaigns. To implement weathering models, data is gathered in alteration matrix by mean of a calculated weathering index.

Using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) constrains client updates to a compact subspace, which reduces uplink traffic by more than 99 percent versus full-model FedAvg, stabilizes aggregation under non-IID data, and naturally supports personalization because each client can keep a locally tuned adapter. On language modeling (PTB) and image generation (CIFAR-10), FedGen-Edge achieves lower perplexity/FID and faster convergence than strong baselines while retaining a simple FedAvg-style server.

Existing systems often rely on centralized intermediaries, which reintroduce trust bottlenecks, or lack decentralized identity-resolution mechanisms, limiting persistence and cross-network interoperability.\n  We propose the Decentralized Interstellar Agent Protocol (DIAP), a novel framework for agent identity and communication that enables persistent, verifiable, and trustless interoperability in fully decentralized environments. DIAP binds an agent's identity to an immutable IPFS or IPNS content identifier and uses zero-knowledge proofs (ZKP) to dynamically and statelessly prove ownership, removing the need for record updates.\n  We present a Rust SDK that integrates Noir (for zero-knowledge proofs), DID-Key, IPFS, and a hybrid peer-to-peer stack combining Libp2p GossipSub for discovery and Iroh for high-performance, QUIC based data exchange. DIAP introduces a zero-dependency ZKP deployment model through a universal proof manager and compile-time build script that embeds a precompiled Noir circuit, eliminating the need for external ZKP toolchains. This enables instant, verifiable, and privacy-preserving identity proofs.\n  This work establishes a practical, high-performance foundation for next-generation autonomous agent ecosystems and agent-to-agent (A to A) economies.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86DIAP\u534f\u8bae\uff0c\u4e00\u4e2a\u53bb\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316\u7684\u661f\u9645\u4ee3\u7406\u534f\u8bae\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408IPFS/IPNS\u3001\u96f6\u77e5\u8bc6\u8bc1\u660e\u548c\u6df7\u5408P2P\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u81ea\u4e3b\u4ee3\u7406\u7684\u6301\u4e45\u5316\u3001\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u548c\u65e0\u4fe1\u4efb\u4e92\u64cd\u4f5c\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5b8c\u5168\u53bb\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316\u3001\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e14\u4fdd\u62a4\u9690\u79c1\u7684\u81ea\u4e3b\u4ee3\u7406\u901a\u4fe1\u534f\u8bae\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u7cfb\u7edf\u8981\u4e48\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316\u4e2d\u4ecb\uff0c\u8981\u4e48\u7f3a\u4e4f\u53bb\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316\u8eab\u4efd\u89e3\u6790\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u6301\u4e45\u6027\u548c\u8de8\u7f51\u7edc\u4e92\u64cd\u4f5c\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528Rust SDK\u96c6\u6210Noir\uff08\u96f6\u77e5\u8bc6\u8bc1\u660e\uff09\u3001DID-Key\u3001IPFS\u548c\u6df7\u5408P2P\u5806\u6808\uff08Libp2p GossipSub\u7528\u4e8e\u53d1\u73b0\uff0cIroh\u7528\u4e8e\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u6570\u636e\u4ea4\u6362\uff09\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u96f6\u4f9d\u8d56ZKP\u90e8\u7f72\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u9884\u7f16\u8bd1Noir\u7535\u8def\u3002", "result": "\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u7684\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u4e0b\u4e00\u4ee3\u81ea\u4e3b\u4ee3\u7406\u751f\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u548c\u4ee3\u7406\u5230\u4ee3\u7406\u7ecf\u6d4e\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5373\u65f6\u3001\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e14\u4fdd\u62a4\u9690\u79c1\u7684\u8eab\u4efd\u8bc1\u660e\u3002", "conclusion": "DIAP\u4e3a\u81ea\u4e3b\u4ee3\u7406\u901a\u4fe1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u53bb\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u8eab\u4efd\u9a8c\u8bc1\u548c\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3aA2A\u7ecf\u6d4e\u5960\u5b9a\u4e86\u6280\u672f\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

Across seven ecologically diverse U.S. counties, models achieve accuracies of 0.755-0.878 and Quadratic Weighted Kappa up to 0.951, with principal components explaining 87-94% of indicator variance. Transfer tests show reliable performance between ecologically similar regions but collapse across dissimilar contexts.

In this paper, we extends maximum entropy framework by proposing a trajectory entropy-constrained reinforcement learning (TECRL) framework to address these two challenges. Within this framework, we first separately learn two Q-functions, one associated with reward and the other with entropy, ensuring clean and stable value targets unaffected by temperature updates. Then, the dedicated entropy Q-function, explicitly quantifying the expected cumulative entropy, enables us to enforce a trajectory entropy constraint and consequently control the policy long-term stochasticity. Building on this TECRL framework, we develop a practical off-policy algorithm, DSAC-E, by extending the state-of-the-art distributional soft actor-critic with three refinements (DSAC-T). Empirical results on the OpenAI Gym benchmark demonstrate that our DSAC-E can achieve higher returns and better stability.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u8f68\u8ff9\u71b5\u7ea6\u675f\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60(TECRL)\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u79bb\u5956\u52b1\u548c\u71b5\u7684Q\u51fd\u6570\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u6700\u5927\u71b5RL\u4e2d\u6e29\u5ea6\u53c2\u6570\u66f4\u65b0\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684Q\u503c\u975e\u5e73\u7a33\u6027\u548c\u77ed\u89c6\u5c40\u90e8\u71b5\u8c03\u8282\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u6700\u5927\u71b5RL\u6846\u67b6\u5b58\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u74f6\u9888\uff1a1\uff09\u6e29\u5ea6\u53c2\u6570\u66f4\u65b0\u4e0e\u71b5\u6ce8\u5165\u5171\u540c\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684Q\u503c\u4f30\u8ba1\u975e\u5e73\u7a33\u6027\uff1b2\uff09\u4ec5\u57fa\u4e8e\u5355\u6b65\u71b5\u7684\u77ed\u89c6\u5c40\u90e8\u71b5\u8c03\u8282\uff0c\u672a\u8003\u8651\u65f6\u95f4\u7d2f\u79ef\u71b5\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faTECRL\u6846\u67b6\uff1a\u5206\u522b\u5b66\u4e60\u5956\u52b1Q\u51fd\u6570\u548c\u71b5Q\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u503c\u76ee\u6807\u4e0d\u53d7\u6e29\u5ea6\u66f4\u65b0\u5f71\u54cd\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u4e13\u7528\u71b5Q\u51fd\u6570\u91cf\u5316\u671f\u671b\u7d2f\u79ef\u71b5\uff0c\u5b9e\u65bd\u8f68\u8ff9\u71b5\u7ea6\u675f\u4ee5\u63a7\u5236\u7b56\u7565\u957f\u671f\u968f\u673a\u6027\u3002\u57fa\u4e8e\u6b64\u5f00\u53d1DSAC-E\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u6269\u5c55\u5206\u5e03\u8f6f\u6f14\u5458-\u8bc4\u8bba\u5bb6\u3002", "result": "\u5728OpenAI Gym\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cDSAC-E\u80fd\u591f\u83b7\u5f97\u66f4\u9ad8\u56de\u62a5\u548c\u66f4\u597d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "TECRL\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u79bbQ\u51fd\u6570\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u8f68\u8ff9\u71b5\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u6700\u5927\u71b5RL\u4e2d\u7684\u5173\u952e\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u7b97\u6cd5\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002"}}

Deploying smaller models (i.e., small language models (SLMs)) on edge devices offers additional advantages, such as reduced latency and independence from network connectivity.

This study evaluates the power efficiency of five representative SLMs - Llama 3.2, Phi-3 Mini, TinyLlama, and Gemma 2 on Raspberry Pi 5, Jetson Nano, and Jetson Orin Nano (CPU and GPU configurations). Results show that Jetson Orin Nano with GPU acceleration achieves the highest energy-to-performance ratio, significantly outperforming CPU-based setups. Llama 3.2 provides the best balance of accuracy and power efficiency, while TinyLlama is well-suited for low-power environments at the cost of reduced accuracy. In contrast, Phi-3 Mini consumes the most energy despite its high accuracy. In addition, GPU acceleration, memory bandwidth, and model architecture are key in optimizing inference energy efficiency.

Through physics-constrained learning on 15 representative patterns spanning current production to future research nodes, we demonstrate consistent sub-nanometer EPE performance (0.664-2.536 nm range) using only 50 training samples per pattern. Adaptive physics learning achieves an average improvement of 69.9\\% over CNN baselines without physics constraints, with a significant inference speedup over rigorous electromagnetic solvers after training completion. This approach requires 90\\% fewer training samples through cross-geometry generalization compared to pattern-specific CNN training approaches.

This \"one-policy-fits-all\" approach leads to significant compromises in fairness, throughput, and latency, particularly with the rise of heterogeneous hardware and varied application architectures.\n  This paper proposes a new paradigm: dynamically selecting the optimal policy from a portfolio of specialized schedulers rather than designing a single, monolithic one. We present the Adaptive Scheduling Agent (ASA), a lightweight framework that intelligently matches workloads to the most suitable \"expert\" scheduling policy at runtime. ASA's core is a novel, low-overhead offline/online approach. First, an offline process trains a universal, hardware-agnostic machine learning model to recognize abstract workload patterns from system behaviors. Second, at runtime, ASA continually processes the model's predictions using a time-weighted probability voting algorithm to identify the workload, then makes a scheduling decision by consulting a pre-configured, machine-specific mapping table to switch to the optimal scheduler via Linux's sched_ext framework. This decoupled architecture allows ASA to adapt to new hardware platforms rapidly without expensive retraining of the core recognition model.\n  Our evaluation, based on a novel benchmark focused on user-experience metrics, demonstrates that ASA consistently outperforms the default Linux scheduler (EEVDF), achieving superior results in 86.4% of test scenarios. Furthermore, ASA's selections are near-optimal, ranking among the top three schedulers in 78.6% of all scenarios. This validates our approach as a practical path toward more intelligent, adaptive, and responsive operating system schedulers.", "AI": {"tldr": "ASA\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u5ea6\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u8bc6\u522b\u5de5\u4f5c\u8d1f\u8f7d\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u4ece\u4e13\u5bb6\u8c03\u5ea6\u5668\u7ec4\u5408\u4e2d\u9009\u62e9\u6700\u4f18\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u572886.4%\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u4f18\u4e8eLinux\u9ed8\u8ba4\u8c03\u5ea6\u5668\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u4ee3\u64cd\u4f5c\u7cfb\u7edf\u8c03\u5ea6\u5668\u91c7\u7528\u5355\u4e00\u9759\u6001\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u9002\u5e94\u5f02\u6784\u786c\u4ef6\u548c\u591a\u6837\u5316\u5de5\u4f5c\u8d1f\u8f7d\u7684\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u3001\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u548c\u5ef6\u8fdf\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u663e\u8457\u59a5\u534f\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8c03\u5ea6\u4ee3\u7406(ASA)\uff1a1)\u79bb\u7ebf\u8bad\u7ec3\u786c\u4ef6\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u8bc6\u522b\u62bd\u8c61\u5de5\u4f5c\u8d1f\u8f7d\u6a21\u5f0f\uff1b2)\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u4f7f\u7528\u65f6\u95f4\u52a0\u6743\u6982\u7387\u6295\u7968\u7b97\u6cd5\u8bc6\u522b\u5de5\u4f5c\u8d1f\u8f7d\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9884\u914d\u7f6e\u6620\u5c04\u8868\u5207\u6362\u5230\u6700\u4f18\u8c03\u5ea6\u5668\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u57fa\u4e8e\u7528\u6237\u4f53\u9a8c\u6307\u6807\u7684\u65b0\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cASA\u572886.4%\u7684\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u4f18\u4e8eLinux\u9ed8\u8ba4\u8c03\u5ea6\u5668(EEVDF)\uff0c\u4e14\u572878.6%\u7684\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u6392\u540d\u524d\u4e09\u3002", "conclusion": "ASA\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u52a8\u6001\u9009\u62e9\u4e13\u5bb6\u8c03\u5ea6\u5668\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u662f\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u667a\u80fd\u3001\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u548c\u54cd\u5e94\u5f0f\u64cd\u4f5c\u7cfb\u7edf\u8c03\u5ea6\u5668\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u8def\u5f84\u3002"}}

We demonstrate that this mixture-contaminated training structure causes systematic failure of recursive partitioning methods, with Random Forest achieving negative r-squared (-0.664, worse than predicting the mean) on held-out test data. Information-theoretic approaches based on Shannon entropy and mutual information provide superior generalization, achieving r-squared of 0.191 and RMSE of 0.284 on 1,218 corporate bankruptcies (1980-2023). Analysis reveals that leverage-based features contain 1.510 bits of mutual information while size effects contribute only 0.086 bits, contradicting regulatory assumptions about scale-dependent recovery. These results establish practical guidance for financial institutions deploying LGD models under Basel III requirements when representative outcome data is unavailable at sufficient scale.

Part A: Stochastic Stability in Non-zero-Sum Games", "comment": null, "summary": "Reinforcement-based learning has attracted considerable attention both in modeling human behavior as well as in engineering, for designing measurement- or payoff-based optimization schemes. Such learning schemes exhibit several advantages, especially in relation to filtering out noisy observations. However, they may exhibit several limitations when applied in a distributed setup. In multi-player weakly-acyclic games, and when each player applies an independent copy of the learning dynamics, convergence to (usually desirable) pure Nash equilibria cannot be guaranteed. Prior work has only focused on a small class of games, namely potential and coordination games. To address this main limitation, this paper introduces a novel payoff-based learning scheme for distributed optimization, namely aspiration-based perturbed learning automata (APLA). In this class of dynamics, and contrary to standard reinforcement-based learning schemes, each player's probability distribution for selecting actions is reinforced both by repeated selection and an aspiration factor that captures the player's satisfaction level. We provide a stochastic stability analysis of APLA in multi-player positive-utility games under the presence of noisy observations. This is the first part of the paper that characterizes stochastic stability in generic non-zero-sum games by establishing equivalence of the induced infinite-dimensional Markov chain with a finite dimensional one. In the second part, stochastic stability is further specialized to weakly acyclic games.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u671f\u671b\u7684\u6270\u52a8\u5b66\u4e60\u81ea\u52a8\u673a(APLA)\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u89e3\u51b3\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u4f18\u5316\u4e2d\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u591a\u73a9\u5bb6\u5f31\u65e0\u73af\u6e38\u620f\u4e2d\u65e0\u6cd5\u4fdd\u8bc1\u6536\u655b\u5230\u7eaf\u7eb3\u4ec0\u5747\u8861\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u591a\u73a9\u5bb6\u5f31\u65e0\u73af\u6e38\u620f\u4e2d\uff0c\u5f53\u6bcf\u4e2a\u73a9\u5bb6\u72ec\u7acb\u5e94\u7528\u5b66\u4e60\u52a8\u6001\u65f6\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u4fdd\u8bc1\u6536\u655b\u5230\u7eaf\u7eb3\u4ec0\u5747\u8861\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u4ec5\u5173\u6ce8\u52bf\u535a\u5f08\u548c\u534f\u8c03\u535a\u5f08\u7b49\u5c0f\u7c7b\u6e38\u620f\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86APLA\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u73a9\u5bb6\u7684\u52a8\u4f5c\u9009\u62e9\u6982\u7387\u5206\u5e03\u4e0d\u4ec5\u901a\u8fc7\u91cd\u590d\u9009\u62e9\u6765\u5f3a\u5316\uff0c\u8fd8\u901a\u8fc7\u6355\u6349\u73a9\u5bb6\u6ee1\u610f\u5ea6\u7684\u671f\u671b\u56e0\u5b50\u6765\u5f3a\u5316\u3002\u5728\u5b58\u5728\u566a\u58f0\u89c2\u6d4b\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u5bf9\u591a\u73a9\u5bb6\u6b63\u6548\u7528\u535a\u5f08\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u968f\u673a\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "\u9996\u6b21\u5728\u4e00\u822c\u975e\u96f6\u548c\u535a\u5f08\u4e2d\u901a\u8fc7\u5efa\u7acb\u65e0\u9650\u7ef4\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u94fe\u4e0e\u6709\u9650\u7ef4\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u94fe\u7684\u7b49\u4ef7\u6027\u6765\u8868\u5f81\u968f\u673a\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002\u5728\u5f31\u65e0\u73af\u6e38\u620f\u4e2d\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u4e13\u95e8\u5316\u968f\u673a\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u5206\u6790\u3002", "conclusion": "APLA\u65b9\u6848\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u4f18\u5316\u4e2d\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u6536\u655b\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u591a\u73a9\u5bb6\u975e\u96f6\u548c\u535a\u5f08\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\u548c\u5206\u6790\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

This advancement challenges the precise prediction of future maintenance needs for assets, which is crucial for reducing downtime and operational costs. However, the effectiveness of data-driven methodologies in the nuclear sector requires extensive domain knowledge due to the complexity of the systems involved. Thus, this paper proposes a novel predictive maintenance methodology that combines data-driven techniques with domain knowledge from a nuclear equipment. The methodological originality of this paper is located on two levels: highlighting the limitations of purely data-driven approaches and demonstrating the importance of knowledge in enhancing the performance of the predictive models. The applicative novelty of this work lies in its use within a domain such as a nuclear industry, which is highly restricted and ultrasensitive due to security, economic and environmental concerns. A detailed real-world case study which compares the current state of equipment monitoring with two scenarios, demonstrate that the methodology significantly outperforms purely data-driven methods in failure prediction. While purely data-driven methods achieve only a modest performance with a prediction horizon limited to 3 h and a F1 score of 56.36%, the hybrid approach increases the prediction horizon to 24 h and achieves a higher F1 score of 93.12%.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u6280\u672f\u548c\u6838\u5de5\u4e1a\u9886\u57df\u77e5\u8bc6\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u7ef4\u62a4\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u6838\u5de5\u4e1a\u9886\u57df\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u7eaf\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c06\u9884\u6d4b\u65f6\u95f4\u4ece3\u5c0f\u65f6\u5ef6\u957f\u523024\u5c0f\u65f6\uff0cF1\u5206\u6570\u4ece56.36%\u63d0\u5347\u523093.12%\u3002", "motivation": "\u7269\u8054\u7f51\u548c\u5de5\u4e1a4.0\u7684\u878d\u5408\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u6838\u5de5\u4e1a\u7684\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f46\u6838\u5de5\u4e1a\u7cfb\u7edf\u590d\u6742\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5927\u91cf\u9886\u57df\u77e5\u8bc6\u3002\u7eaf\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u9884\u6d4b\u8bbe\u5907\u7ef4\u62a4\u9700\u6c42\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u6df7\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c06\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u6280\u672f\u4e0e\u6838\u8bbe\u5907\u9886\u57df\u77e5\u8bc6\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u7eaf\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5c55\u793a\u77e5\u8bc6\u5728\u63d0\u5347\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u4e2d\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u771f\u5b9e\u6848\u4f8b\u7814\u7a76\u6bd4\u8f83\uff0c\u6df7\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u7eaf\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a\u9884\u6d4b\u65f6\u95f4\u4ece3\u5c0f\u65f6\u5ef6\u957f\u523024\u5c0f\u65f6\uff0cF1\u5206\u6570\u4ece56.36%\u63d0\u5347\u523093.12%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5728\u6838\u5de5\u4e1a\u7b49\u9ad8\u5ea6\u53d7\u9650\u548c\u654f\u611f\u7684\u9886\u57df\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u9886\u57df\u77e5\u8bc6\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u7ef4\u62a4\u65b9\u6cd5\u6bd4\u7eaf\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u65b9\u6cd5\u66f4\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6545\u969c\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

To this end, in this paper, we propose a novel lightweight compression framework that leverages Range Asymmetric Numeral Systems (rANS) encoding with asymmetric integer quantization and sparse tensor representation to reduce transmission overhead dramatically. Specifically, our approach combines asymmetric integer quantization with a sparse representation technique, eliminating the need for complex probability modeling or network modifications. The key contributions include: (1) a distribution-agnostic compression pipeline that exploits inherent tensor sparsity to achieve bandwidth reduction with minimal computational overhead; (2) an approximate theoretical model that optimizes tensor reshaping dimensions to maximize compression efficiency; and (3) a GPU-accelerated implementation with sub-millisecond encoding/decoding latency. Extensive evaluations across diverse neural architectures (ResNet, VGG16, MobileNetV2, SwinT, DenseNet121, EfficientNetB0) demonstrate that the proposed framework consistently maintains near-baseline accuracy across CIFAR100 and ImageNet benchmarks. Moreover, we validated the framework's effectiveness on advanced natural language processing tasks by employing Llama2 7B and 13B on standard benchmarks such as MMLU, HellaSwag, ARC, PIQA, Winogrande, BoolQ, and OpenBookQA, demonstrating its broad applicability beyond computer vision.

However, RL agents often operate under the assumption of environmental stationarity, which poses a great challenge to learning efficiency since many environments are inherently non-stationary.

To address this issue, we introduce the Clustering Orthogonal Weight Modified (COWM) layer, which can be integrated into the policy network of any RL algorithm and mitigate non-stationarity effectively. The COWM layer stabilizes the learning process by employing clustering techniques and a projection matrix. Our approach not only improves learning speed but also reduces gradient interference, thereby enhancing the overall learning efficiency.

In this work, we systematically study the effect of tokenizer design, specifically scaling and quantization strategies, on model performance, alongside the impact of pretraining versus random initialization. We show that tokenizer configuration primarily governs the representational capacity and stability of the model, while transfer learning influences optimization efficiency and alignment. Using a combination of empirical training experiments and theoretical analyses, we demonstrate that pretrained models consistently leverage well-designed tokenizers more effectively, particularly at smaller vocabulary sizes. Conversely, misaligned tokenization can diminish or even invert the benefits of pretraining. These findings highlight the importance of careful tokenization in time series modeling and suggest that combining small, efficient vocabularies with pretrained weights is especially advantageous in multi-modal forecasting settings, where the overall vocabulary must be shared across modalities.

To solve these problems, recent research has focused on constructing cloud-edge consortia that integrate server-based LLM with small language models (SLMs) on mobile edge devices. Furthermore, designing collaborative training mechanisms within such consortia to enhance inference performance has emerged as a promising research direction. However, the cross-domain deployment of SLMs, coupled with structural heterogeneity in SLMs architectures, poses significant challenges to enhancing model performance. To this end, we propose Co-PLMs, a novel co-tuning framework for collaborative training of large and small language models, which integrates the process of structure-agnostic mutual learning to realize knowledge exchange between the heterogeneous language models. This framework employs distilled proxy models (DPMs) as bridges to enable collaborative training between the heterogeneous server-based LLM and on-device SLMs, while preserving the domain-specific insights of each device.

By harnessing multi-modal deep learning methods to integrate heterogeneous and imbalanced electronic health records (EHR), we aim to advance early prediction of GVHD, paving the way for timely intervention and improved patient outcomes. In this study, we analyzed pre-transplant electronic health records (EHR) spanning the period before surgery for 2,100 liver transplantation patients, including 42 cases of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), from a cohort treated at Mayo Clinic between 1992 and 2025. The dataset comprised four major modalities: patient demographics, laboratory tests, diagnoses, and medications. We developed a multi-modal deep learning framework that dynamically fuses these modalities, handles irregular records with missing values, and addresses extreme class imbalance through AUC-based optimization. The developed framework outperforms all single-modal and multi-modal machine learning baselines, achieving an AUC of 0.836, an AUPRC of 0.157, a recall of 0.768, and a specificity of 0.803. It also demonstrates the effectiveness of our approach in capturing complementary information from different modalities, leading to improved performance. Our multi-modal deep learning framework substantially improves existing approaches for early GVHD prediction. By effectively addressing the challenges of heterogeneity and extreme class imbalance in real-world EHR, it achieves accurate early prediction.

Despite the computation and communication efficiency of these systems, due to limited computation resources on edge devices, relying on more computationally rich systems on the cloud side is inevitable in most cases. Cloud inference systems can achieve the best performance while the computation and communication cost is dramatically increasing by the expansion of a number of edge devices relying on these systems. Hence, there is a trade-off between the computation, communication, and performance of these systems. In this paper, we propose a novel framework, dubbed as Eccentric that learns models with different levels of trade-offs between these conflicting objectives. This framework, based on an adaptation of knowledge from the edge model to the cloud one, reduces the computation and communication costs of the system during inference while achieving the best performance possible.

However, the models remain vulnerable at inference time when they are trained collaboratively through Federated Learning (FL), an approach adopted to protect patient privacy. Adversarial attacks can subtly alter medical scans in ways invisible to the human eye yet powerful enough to mislead AI models, potentially causing serious misdiagnoses. Existing defenses often assume centralized data and struggle to cope with the decentralized and diverse nature of federated medical settings. In this work, we present MedFedPure, a personalized federated learning defense framework designed to protect diagnostic AI models at inference time without compromising privacy or accuracy. MedFedPure combines three key elements: (1) a personalized FL model that adapts to the unique data distribution of each institution; (2) a Masked Autoencoder (MAE) that detects suspicious inputs by exposing hidden perturbations; and (3) an adaptive diffusion-based purification module that selectively cleans only the flagged scans before classification. Together, these steps offer robust protection while preserving the integrity of normal, benign images. We evaluated MedFedPure on the Br35H brain MRI dataset. The results show a significant gain in adversarial robustness, improving performance from 49.50% to 87.33% under strong attacks, while maintaining a high clean accuracy of 97.67%.

Although recent deep learning and numerical acceleration methods have improved speed and scalability, they often rely on single CNN architectures or single neural operators, which struggle to generalize in unknown or complex geological settings and are ineffective at distinguishing diverse geological types. To address these issues, we propose a Structure-Aligned Encoder-Mixture-of-Operators (SA-EMO) architecture for velocity-field inversion under unknown subsurface structures. First, a structure-aligned encoder maps high-dimensional seismic wavefields into a physically consistent latent space, thereby eliminating spatio-temporal mismatch between the waveform and velocity domains, recovering high-frequency components, and enhancing feature generalization. Then, an adaptive routing mechanism selects and fuses multiple neural-operator experts, including spectral, wavelet, multiscale, and local operators, to predict the velocity model. We systematically evaluate our approach on the OpenFWI benchmark and the Marmousi2 dataset. Results show that SA-EMO significantly outperforms traditional CNN or single-operator methods, achieving an average MAE reduction of approximately 58.443% and an improvement in boundary resolution of about 10.308%. Ablation studies further reveal that the structure-aligned encoder, the expert-fusion mechanism, and the routing module each contribute markedly to the performance gains.

To meet stringent quality-of-service (QoS) requirements, existing LLM serving systems disaggregate the prefill and decode phases of inference. However, decode instances often experience low GPU utilization due to their memory-bound nature and insufficient batching in dynamic workloads, leaving compute resources underutilized.\n  We introduce Harli, a serving system that improves GPU utilization by co-locating parameter-efficient finetuning (PEFT) tasks with LLM decode instances. PEFT tasks are compute-bound and memory-efficient, making them ideal candidates for safe co-location. Specifically, Harli addresses key challenges--limited memory and unpredictable interference--using three components: a unified memory allocator for runtime memory reuse, a two-stage latency predictor for decode latency modeling, and a QoS-guaranteed throughput-maximizing scheduler for throughput maximization. Experimental results show that Harli improves the finetune throughput by 46.2% on average (up to 92.0%) over state-of-the-art serving systems, while maintaining strict QoS guarantees for inference decode.", "AI": {"tldr": "Harli\u662f\u4e00\u4e2aLLM\u670d\u52a1\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u53c2\u6570\u9ad8\u6548\u5fae\u8c03\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0eLLM\u89e3\u7801\u5b9e\u4f8b\u5171\u7f6e\u6765\u63d0\u9ad8GPU\u5229\u7528\u7387\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u89e3\u7801\u5b9e\u4f8bGPU\u5229\u7528\u7387\u4f4e\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709LLM\u670d\u52a1\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u89e3\u7801\u5b9e\u4f8b\u7531\u4e8e\u5185\u5b58\u9650\u5236\u7279\u6027\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u5de5\u4f5c\u8d1f\u8f7d\u4e2d\u6279\u5904\u7406\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4GPU\u5229\u7528\u7387\u4f4e\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\u672a\u5145\u5206\u5229\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u7edf\u4e00\u5185\u5b58\u5206\u914d\u5668\u8fdb\u884c\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u5185\u5b58\u590d\u7528\u3001\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u5ef6\u8fdf\u9884\u6d4b\u5668\u5efa\u6a21\u89e3\u7801\u5ef6\u8fdf\u3001\u4ee5\u53caQoS\u4fdd\u8bc1\u7684\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u6700\u5927\u5316\u8c03\u5ea6\u5668\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0cHarli\u76f8\u6bd4\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u670d\u52a1\u7cfb\u7edf\u5e73\u5747\u63d0\u9ad8\u5fae\u8c03\u541e\u5410\u91cf46.2%\uff08\u6700\u9ad892.0%\uff09\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u63a8\u7406\u89e3\u7801\u7684\u4e25\u683cQoS\u4fdd\u8bc1\u3002", "conclusion": "Harli\u901a\u8fc7\u5b89\u5168\u5171\u7f6e\u8ba1\u7b97\u5bc6\u96c6\u7684PEFT\u4efb\u52a1\u548c\u5185\u5b58\u5bc6\u96c6\u7684LLM\u89e3\u7801\u5b9e\u4f8b\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e86GPU\u5229\u7528\u7387\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e14\u4e0d\u635f\u5bb3\u670d\u52a1\u8d28\u91cf\u3002"}}

The loading and unloading sequences generated by strain gauges can be identified through time series classification (TSC) algorithms. Recently, deep learning models, e.g., convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have shown remarkable success in the TSC task, as they can extract discriminative local features from the subsequences to identify the time series. However, we observe that only the local features may not be sufficient for expressing the time series, especially when the local sub-sequences between different time series are very similar, e.g., SGS data of aircraft wings in static strength experiments. Nevertheless, CNNs suffer from the limitation in extracting global features due to the nature of convolution operations. For extracting global features to more comprehensively represent the SGS time series, we propose two insights: (i) Constructing global features through feature engineering. (ii) Learning high-order relationships between local features to capture global features. To realize and utilize them, we propose a hypergraph-based global feature learning and fusion framework, which learns and fuses global features for semantic consistency to enhance the representation of SGS time series, thereby improving recognition accuracy.

While effective in centralized systems, its behavior in decentralized settings, where network latency often dominates compute, remains under-characterized. We present Decentralized Speculative Decoding (DSD), a plug-and-play framework for decentralized inference that turns communication delay into useful computation by verifying multiple candidate tokens in parallel across distributed nodes. We further introduce an adaptive speculative verification strategy that adjusts acceptance thresholds by token-level semantic importance, delivering an additional 15% to 20% end-to-end speedup without retraining. In theory, DSD reduces cross-node communication cost by approximately (N-1)t1(k-1)/k, where t1 is per-link latency and k is the average number of tokens accepted per round. In practice, DSD achieves up to 2.56x speedup on HumanEval and 2.59x on GSM8K, surpassing the Eagle3 baseline while preserving accuracy.

Unlike full-field simulations, which are computationally demanding, the present work relies on mean-field statistical descriptors extracted from high-fidelity simulations. A dataset of 120 grain growth sequences was processed into normalized grain size distributions as a function of time. The models were trained to predict future distributions from a short temporal history using a recursive forecasting strategy. Among the tested models, the LSTM network achieved the highest accuracy (above 90\\%) and the most stable performance, maintaining physically consistent predictions over extended horizons while reducing computation time from about 20 minutes per sequence to only a few seconds, whereas the other architectures tended to diverge when forecasting further in time.

While manageable in small labs, such variability can escalate into serious risks at larger scales, such as architectural 3D printing, where noise may cause structural or economic failures. This contribution presents a noise-aware decision-making algorithm that quantifies and models device-specific noise profiles to manage variability adaptively. It uses distributional analysis and pairwise divergence metrics with clustering to choose between single-device and robust multi-device Bayesian optimization strategies. Unlike conventional methods that assume homogeneous devices or generic robustness, this framework explicitly leverages inter-device differences to enhance performance, reproducibility, and efficiency. An experimental case study involving three nominally identical 3D printers (same brand, model, and close serial numbers) demonstrates reduced redundancy, lower resource usage, and improved reliability.

One of the popular solutions to few-shot learning is metric-based meta-learning. However, it highly depends on the deep metric learned on seen classes, which may overfit to seen classes and fail to generalize well on unseen classes. To improve the generalization, we explore the substructures of classifiers and propose a novel meta-learning algorithm to learn each classifier as a combination of meta-components. Meta-components are learned across meta-learning episodes on seen classes and disentangled by imposing an orthogonal regularizer to promote its diversity and capture various shared substructures among different classifiers.

The framework integrated SHAP-based feature attributions with demographic audits to connect predictive explanations with observed disparities for actionable insights. Probabilistic calibration metrics (Brier Score and Expected Calibration Error) are incorporated to ensure reliable risk predictions across subgroups. Random Forest, SVM, and XGBoost models were trained with isotonic and Platt scaling for calibration and fairness comparison. A calibrated Random Forest achieved a high predictive accuracy of 90.8%. SHAP analysis identified follicle count, weight gain, and menstrual irregularity as the most influential features, which are consistent with the Rotterdam diagnostic criteria. Although the SVM with isotonic calibration achieved the lowest calibration error (ECE = 0.0541), the Random Forest model provided a better balance between calibration and interpretability (Brier = 0.0678, ECE = 0.0666). Therefore, it was selected for detailed fairness and SHAP analyses. Subgroup analysis revealed that the model performed best among women aged 25-35 (accuracy 90.9%) but underperformed in those under 25 (69.2%), highlighting age-related disparities. The model achieved perfect precision in obese women and maintained high recall in lean PCOS cases, demonstrating robustness across phenotypes.

Given a batch of tasks each requesting one or more data items, where both tasks and data are distributed across multiple machines, each task must get co-located with its target data (by moving tasks and/or data) and executed. We present TD-Orch, an efficient and scalable orchestration framework featuring a simple application developer interface. TD-Orch employs a distributed push-pull technique, leveraging the bidirectional f low of both tasks and data to achieve scalable load balance across machines even under highly skewed data request (data hot spots), with minimal communication overhead. Experimental results show that TD-Orch achieves up to 2.7x speedup over existing distributed scheduling baselines. Building on TD-Orch, we present TDO-GP, a distributed graph processing system for general graph problems, demonstrating the effectiveness of the underlying framework. We design three families of implementation techniques to fully leverage the execution flow provided by TD-Orch.

Two improved PINN approaches were developed in this research: an adaptive approach with self-adaptive loss weighting and a conservative approach enforcing explicit conservation laws. Three benchmark tests were used to demonstrate how effective PINN's are as they relate to the type of problem being solved (i.e., time dependent RLW equation). The first was a single soliton traveling along a line (propagation), the second was the interaction between two solitons, and the third was the evolution of an undular bore over the course of $t=250$. The results demonstrated that the effectiveness of PINNs are problem specific. The adaptive PINN was significantly better than both the conservative PINN and the standard PINN at solving problems involving complex nonlinear interactions such as colliding two solitons. The conservative approach was significantly better at solving problems involving long term behavior of single solitons and undular bores. However, the most important finding from this research is that explicitly enforcing conservation laws may be harmful to optimizing the solution of highly nonlinear systems of equations and therefore requires special training methods. The results from our adaptive and conservative approaches were within $O(10^{-5})$ of established numerical solutions for the same problem, thus demonstrating that PINNs can provide accurate solutions to complex systems of partial differential equations without the need for a discretization of space or time (mesh free). Moreover, the finding from this research challenges the assumptions that conservation enforcement will always improve the performance of a PINN and provides researchers with guidelines for designing PINNs for use on specific types of problems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e24\u79cd\u6539\u8fdb\u7684PINN\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u548c\u4fdd\u5b88\u65b9\u6cd5\uff09\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u957f\u6ce2\u65b9\u7a0b\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0PINN\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u53d6\u51b3\u4e8e\u95ee\u9898\u7c7b\u578b\u3002\u81ea\u9002\u5e94PINN\u5728\u5904\u7406\u590d\u6742\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u65f6\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u597d\uff0c\u800c\u4fdd\u5b88PINN\u5728\u957f\u671f\u884c\u4e3a\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\u66f4\u4f18\u3002", "motivation": "\u6807\u51c6\u7269\u7406\u4fe1\u606f\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u957f\u6ce2\u65b9\u7a0b\u65f6\u4ea7\u751f\u8f83\u5927\u8bef\u5dee\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u6539\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e24\u79cd\u6539\u8fdb\u7684PINN\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a\u5177\u6709\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u635f\u5931\u52a0\u6743\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u5f3a\u5236\u6267\u884c\u660e\u786e\u5b88\u6052\u5b9a\u5f8b\u7684\u4fdd\u5b88\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u4f7f\u7528\u4e09\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff1a\u5355\u5b64\u5b50\u4f20\u64ad\u3001\u53cc\u5b64\u5b50\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u548c\u6d8c\u6d6a\u6f14\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u81ea\u9002\u5e94PINN\u5728\u590d\u6742\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\uff08\u5982\u5b64\u5b50\u78b0\u649e\uff09\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u4fdd\u5b88PINN\u548c\u6807\u51c6PINN\uff0c\u800c\u4fdd\u5b88PINN\u5728\u5355\u5b64\u5b50\u548c\u6d8c\u6d6a\u7684\u957f\u671f\u884c\u4e3a\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u597d\u3002\u4e24\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u8bef\u5dee\u5747\u5728O(10^-5)\u91cf\u7ea7\u3002", "conclusion": "\u660e\u786e\u5f3a\u5236\u6267\u884c\u5b88\u6052\u5b9a\u5f8b\u53ef\u80fd\u5bf9\u9ad8\u5ea6\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u6709\u5bb3\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u7279\u6b8a\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002PINN\u53ef\u4ee5\u4e3a\u590d\u6742\u504f\u5fae\u5206\u65b9\u7a0b\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u65e0\u7f51\u683c\u89e3\uff0c\u4f46\u5b88\u6052\u5f3a\u5236\u6267\u884c\u5e76\u4e0d\u603b\u662f\u80fd\u63d0\u9ad8PINN\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

Under review", "summary": "Smart cities and pervasive IoT deployments have generated interest in IoT data analysis across transportation and urban planning. At the same time, Large Language Models offer a new interface for exploring IoT data - particularly through natural language. Users today face two key challenges when working with IoT data using LLMs: (1) data collection infrastructure is expensive, producing terabytes of low-level sensor readings that are too granular for direct use, and (2) data analysis is slow, requiring iterative effort and technical expertise. Directly feeding all IoT telemetry to LLMs is impractical due to finite context windows, prohibitive token costs at scale, and non-interactive latencies. What is missing is a system that first parses a user's query to identify the analytical task, then selects the relevant data slices, and finally chooses the right representation before invoking an LLM.\n  We present Flash-Fusion, an end-to-end edge-cloud system that reduces the IoT data collection and analysis burden on users. Two principles guide its design: (1) edge-based statistical summarization (achieving 73.5% data reduction) to address data volume, and (2) cloud-based query planning that clusters behavioral data and assembles context-rich prompts to address data interpretation. We deploy Flash-Fusion on a university bus fleet and evaluate it against a baseline that feeds raw data to a state-of-the-art LLM. Flash-Fusion achieves a 95% latency reduction and 98% decrease in token usage and cost while maintaining high-quality responses.

Running an LM locally on-device improves privacy, enables offline use, and reduces cost, but long-context inference quickly hits a \\emph{memory capacity wall} as the key-value (KV) cache grows linearly with context length and batch size.\n  We present KVSwap, a software framework to break this memory wall by offloading the KV cache to non-volatile secondary storage (disk). KVSwap leverages the observation that only a small, dynamically changing subset of KV entries is critical for generation. It stores the full cache on disk, uses a compact in-memory metadata to predict which entries to preload, overlaps computation with hardware-aware disk access, and orchestrates read patterns to match storage device characteristics. Our evaluation shows that across representative LMs and storage types, KVSwap delivers higher throughput under tight memory budgets while maintaining the generation quality when compared with existing KV cache offloading schemes.", "AI": {"tldr": "KVSwap\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u8f6f\u4ef6\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06KV\u7f13\u5b58\u5378\u8f7d\u5230\u78c1\u76d8\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u7684\u5185\u5b58\u5bb9\u91cf\u74f6\u9888\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u672c\u5730\u8fd0\u884c\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u79fb\u52a8\u548c\u5d4c\u5165\u5f0fAI\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u9690\u79c1\u3001\u79bb\u7ebf\u548c\u6210\u672c\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u4f46\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u63a8\u7406\u4f1a\u56e0KV\u7f13\u5b58\u7ebf\u6027\u589e\u957f\u800c\u9047\u5230\u5185\u5b58\u5bb9\u91cf\u74f6\u9888\u3002", "method": "KVSwap\u5c06\u5b8c\u6574KV\u7f13\u5b58\u5b58\u50a8\u5728\u78c1\u76d8\u4e0a\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u7d27\u51d1\u7684\u5185\u5b58\u5143\u6570\u636e\u9884\u6d4b\u9700\u8981\u9884\u52a0\u8f7d\u7684\u6761\u76ee\uff0c\u91cd\u53e0\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e0e\u786c\u4ef6\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u78c1\u76d8\u8bbf\u95ee\uff0c\u5e76\u534f\u8c03\u8bfb\u53d6\u6a21\u5f0f\u4ee5\u5339\u914d\u5b58\u50a8\u8bbe\u5907\u7279\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u8bc4\u4f30\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u5728\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u5b58\u50a8\u7c7b\u578b\u4e0b\uff0cKVSwap\u5728\u4e25\u683c\u5185\u5b58\u9884\u7b97\u4e0b\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u9ad8\u541e\u5410\u91cf\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709KV\u7f13\u5b58\u5378\u8f7d\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "conclusion": "KVSwap\u6709\u6548\u7a81\u7834\u4e86\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u5185\u5b58\u5bb9\u91cf\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u4e3a\u79fb\u52a8\u548c\u5d4c\u5165\u5f0fAI\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

As of now, the academic community has rigorously verified the number of solutions only up to N <= 26. In 2016, the research team led by PreuBer solved the 27-Queens problem using FPGA hardware, which took approximately one year, though the result remains unverified independently. Recent studies on GPU parallel computing suggest that verifying the 27-Queens solution would still require about 17 months, indicating excessively high time and computational resource costs. To address this challenge, we propose an innovative parallel computing method on NVIDIA GPU platform, with the following core contributions: (1) An iterative depth-first search (DFS) algorithm for solving the N-Queens problem; (2) Complete mapping of the required stack structure to GPU shared memory; (3) Effective avoidance of bank conflicts through meticulously designed memory access patterns; (4) Various optimization techniques are employed to achieve optimal performance. Under the proposed optimization framework, we successfully verified the 27-Queens problem in just 28.4 days using eight RTX 5090 GPUs, thereby confirming the correctness of PreuBer's computational results. Moreover, we have reduced the projected solving time for the next open case-the 28-Queens problem-to approximately 11 months, making its resolution computationally feasible. Compared to the state-of-the-art GPU methods, our method achieves over 10x speedup on identical hardware configurations (8 A100), while delivering over 26x acceleration when utilizing 8 RTX 5090 GPUs, and brings fresh perspectives to this long-stagnant problem.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u521b\u65b0\u7684GPU\u5e76\u884c\u8ba1\u7b97\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u572828.4\u5929\u5185\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e8627\u7687\u540e\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u786e\u8ba4\u4e86PreuBer\u56e2\u961f\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u5e76\u5c0628\u7687\u540e\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u9884\u8ba1\u89e3\u51b3\u65f6\u95f4\u7f29\u77ed\u81f3\u7ea611\u4e2a\u6708\u3002", "motivation": "N\u7687\u540e\u95ee\u9898\u8ba1\u6570\u5177\u6709\u6781\u9ad8\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\uff0c\u76ee\u524d\u5b66\u672f\u754c\u4ec5\u4e25\u683c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5230N<=26\u300227\u7687\u540e\u95ee\u9898\u57282016\u5e74\u7531PreuBer\u56e2\u961f\u7528FPGA\u8017\u65f6\u7ea6\u4e00\u5e74\u89e3\u51b3\uff0c\u4f46\u7ed3\u679c\u672a\u83b7\u72ec\u7acb\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002GPU\u5e76\u884c\u8ba1\u7b97\u9a8c\u8bc127\u7687\u540e\u4ecd\u9700\u7ea617\u4e2a\u6708\uff0c\u65f6\u95f4\u6210\u672c\u8fc7\u9ad8\u3002", "method": "\u5728NVIDIA GPU\u5e73\u53f0\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u521b\u65b0\u5e76\u884c\u8ba1\u7b97\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a\u8fed\u4ee3\u6df1\u5ea6\u4f18\u5148\u641c\u7d22\u7b97\u6cd5\uff1b\u5c06\u6240\u9700\u6808\u7ed3\u6784\u5b8c\u5168\u6620\u5c04\u5230GPU\u5171\u4eab\u5185\u5b58\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u7cbe\u5fc3\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u5185\u5b58\u8bbf\u95ee\u6a21\u5f0f\u6709\u6548\u907f\u514dbank\u51b2\u7a81\uff1b\u91c7\u7528\u591a\u79cd\u4f18\u5316\u6280\u672f\u5b9e\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "result": "\u4f7f\u75288\u5757RTX 5090 GPU\u572828.4\u5929\u5185\u6210\u529f\u9a8c\u8bc127\u7687\u540e\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u786e\u8ba4PreuBer\u8ba1\u7b97\u7ed3\u679c\u6b63\u786e\uff1b\u5c0628\u7687\u540e\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u9884\u8ba1\u89e3\u51b3\u65f6\u95f4\u7f29\u77ed\u81f3\u7ea611\u4e2a\u6708\uff1b\u76f8\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709GPU\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u76f8\u540c\u786c\u4ef6\u914d\u7f6e(8 A100)\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b010\u500d\u4ee5\u4e0a\u52a0\u901f\uff0c\u4f7f\u75288 RTX 5090 GPU\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b026\u500d\u4ee5\u4e0a\u52a0\u901f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86N\u7687\u540e\u95ee\u9898\u6c42\u89e3\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u4e3a\u8fd9\u4e00\u957f\u671f\u505c\u6ede\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u5e26\u6765\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u89c6\u89d2\uff0c\u4f7f\u5f97\u66f4\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u7687\u540e\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u6c42\u89e3\u5728\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e0a\u53d8\u5f97\u53ef\u884c\u3002"}}

Traditional RL-based beam selection models require extensive training time and computational resources, particularly when deployed in diverse environments with varying propagation characteristics posing a major challenge for scalability and energy efficiency. To address this, we propose modeling the environment as a point cloud, where each point represents the locations of gNodeBs (gNBs) and surrounding scatterers. By computing the Chamfer distance between point clouds, structurally similar environments can be efficiently identified, enabling the reuse of pre-trained models through transfer learning. This methodology leads to a 16x reduction in training time and computational overhead, directly contributing to energy efficiency. By minimizing the need for retraining in each new deployment, our approach significantly lowers power consumption and supports the development of green and sustainable Artificial Intelligence (AI) in wireless systems. Furthermore, it accelerates time-to-deployment, reduces carbon emissions associated with training, and enhances the viability of deploying AI-driven communication systems at the edge.

Consequently, the quality of time series data is crucial to TSFM performance, rendering an accurate and efficient data valuation of time series for TSFMs indispensable. However, traditional data valuation methods, such as influence functions, face severe computational bottlenecks due to their poor scalability with growing TSFM model sizes and often fail to preserve temporal dependencies. In this paper, we propose LTSV, a Lightweight Time Series Valuation on TSFMS via in-context finetuning. Grounded in the theoretical evidence that in-context finetuning approximates the influence function, LTSV estimates a sample's contribution by measuring the change in context loss after in-context finetuning, leveraging the strong generalization capabilities of TSFMs to produce robust and transferable data valuations. To capture temporal dependencies, we introduce temporal block aggregation, which integrates per-block influence scores across overlapping time windows. Experiments across multiple time series datasets and models demonstrate that LTSV consistently provides reliable and strong valuation performance, while maintaining manageable computational requirements.

KV cache update, often implemented as allocation, copying, and in-place strided update for each generated token, incurs significant overhead. As the sequence length increases, the allocation and copy overheads dominate the performance. Alternate approaches may allocate large KV tensors upfront to enable in-place updates, but these matrices (with zero-padded rows) cause redundant computations. In this work, we propose a new KV cache allocation mechanism called Balancing Memory and Compute (BMC). BMC allocates, once every r iterations, KV tensors with r redundant rows, allowing in-place update without copy overhead for those iterations, but at the expense of a small amount of redundant computation. Second, we make an interesting observation that the extra rows allocated in the KV tensors and the resulting redundant computation can be repurposed for Speculative Decoding (SD) that improves token generation efficiency. Last, BMC represents a spectrum of design points with different values of r. To identify the best-performing design point(s), we derive a simple analytical model for BMC. The proposed BMC method achieves an average throughput acceleration of up to 3.2x over baseline HuggingFace (without SD). Importantly when we apply BMC with SD, it results in an additional speedup of up to 1.39x, over and above the speedup offered by SD. Further, BMC achieves a throughput acceleration of up to 1.36x and 2.29x over state-of-the-art inference servers vLLM and DeepSpeed, respectively. Although the BMC technique is evaluated extensively across different classes of CPUs (desktop and server class), we also evaluate the scheme with GPUs and demonstrate that it works well for GPUs.", "AI": {"tldr": "BMC\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684KV\u7f13\u5b58\u5206\u914d\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6bcfr\u6b21\u8fed\u4ee3\u5206\u914d\u5e26\u6709r\u4e2a\u5197\u4f59\u884c\u7684KV\u5f20\u91cf\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u539f\u5730\u66f4\u65b0\u800c\u65e0\u9700\u590d\u5236\u5f00\u9500\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5c06\u5197\u4f59\u8ba1\u7b97\u91cd\u65b0\u7528\u4e8e\u63a8\u6d4b\u89e3\u7801\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u751f\u6210\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740GPU\u53ca\u5176\u4e91\u5b9e\u4f8b\u6210\u672c\u98d9\u5347\uff0c\u4eba\u4eec\u5e0c\u671b\u4f7f\u7528CPU\u8fdb\u884c\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u3002\u4f20\u7edf\u7684KV\u7f13\u5b58\u66f4\u65b0\uff08\u5206\u914d\u3001\u590d\u5236\u548c\u539f\u5730\u66f4\u65b0\uff09\u5728\u5e8f\u5217\u957f\u5ea6\u589e\u52a0\u65f6\u6027\u80fd\u5f00\u9500\u663e\u8457\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faBMC\u673a\u5236\uff1a1\uff09\u6bcfr\u6b21\u8fed\u4ee3\u5206\u914d\u5e26r\u4e2a\u5197\u4f59\u884c\u7684KV\u5f20\u91cf\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u539f\u5730\u66f4\u65b0\uff1b2\uff09\u5c06\u5197\u4f59\u8ba1\u7b97\u91cd\u65b0\u7528\u4e8e\u63a8\u6d4b\u89e3\u7801\uff1b3\uff09\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u6a21\u578b\u627e\u5230\u6700\u4f73\u8bbe\u8ba1\u70b9\u3002", "result": "BMC\u5728HuggingFace\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u5e73\u57473.2\u500d\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u52a0\u901f\uff0c\u4e0e\u63a8\u6d4b\u89e3\u7801\u7ed3\u5408\u65f6\u989d\u5916\u63d0\u53471.39\u500d\uff0c\u6bd4vLLM\u548cDeepSpeed\u5206\u522b\u5feb1.36\u500d\u548c2.29\u500d\u3002", "conclusion": "BMC\u5728CPU\u548cGPU\u4e0a\u5747\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5e73\u8861\u5185\u5b58\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347LLM\u63a8\u7406\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}

In recent years, various solutions have been proposed, with data-driven approaches gaining increasing attention due to their superior performance. In this paper, we propose a new method for leak detection. The method is based on water pressure measurements acquired at a series of nodes of a WDN. Our technique is a fully data-driven solution that makes only use of the knowledge of the WDN topology, and a series of pressure data acquisitions obtained in absence of leaks. The proposed solution is based on an feature extractor and a one-class Support Vector Machines (SVM) trained on no-leak data, so that leaks are detected as anomalies. The results achieved on a simulate dataset using the Modena WDN demonstrate that the proposed solution outperforms recent methods for leak detection.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6c34\u538b\u6d4b\u91cf\u548c\u5355\u7c7b\u652f\u6301\u5411\u91cf\u673a\u7684\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u6f0f\u6c34\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ec5\u9700\u65e0\u6cc4\u6f0f\u65f6\u7684\u538b\u529b\u6570\u636e\u548c\u7ba1\u7f51\u62d3\u6251\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u5728\u6a21\u62df\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f9b\u6c34\u7ba1\u7f51\u6bcf\u5e74\u56e0\u6f0f\u6c34\u9020\u6210\u5927\u91cf\u6c34\u8d44\u6e90\u635f\u5931\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u53ef\u9760\u6709\u6548\u7684\u6f0f\u6c34\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u5b9a\u4f4d\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u65b9\u6cd5\u56e0\u5176\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u80fd\u800c\u53d7\u5230\u5173\u6ce8\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u4f9b\u6c34\u7ba1\u7f51\u8282\u70b9\u6c34\u538b\u6d4b\u91cf\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u7279\u5f81\u63d0\u53d6\u5668\u548c\u5728\u65e0\u6cc4\u6f0f\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u5355\u7c7b\u652f\u6301\u5411\u91cf\u673a\uff0c\u5c06\u6f0f\u6c34\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e3a\u5f02\u5e38\u3002", "result": "\u5728Modena\u4f9b\u6c34\u7ba1\u7f51\u7684\u6a21\u62df\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u6700\u8fd1\u7684\u6f0f\u6c34\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u5b8c\u5168\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u4ec5\u9700\u7ba1\u7f51\u62d3\u6251\u548c\u65e0\u6cc4\u6f0f\u538b\u529b\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5c31\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u68c0\u6d4b\u6f0f\u6c34\u5f02\u5e38\u3002"}}

To tackle the challenges, we propose a novel feature selection approach for robust depression analysis, called Incomplete Depression Feature Selection with Missing EEG Channels (IDFS-MEC).

We found that substantial reductions in station numbers after one year of full deployment are possible while retaining high predictive accuracy. A reduction from 42 to 4 stations, for instance, increased mean prediction RMSEs from 0.69 K to 0.83 K for air temperature and from 3.8% to 4.4% for relative humidity, corresponding to RMSE increases of only 20% and 16%, respectively. Predictive accuracy is worse for remote stations in forests than for stations in built-up or open settings, but consistently better than a state-of-the-art numerical urban land-surface model (Surface Urban Energy and Water Balance Scheme). Stations located at the edges between built-up and rural areas are most valuable when reconstructing city-wide climate characteristics.

As the dimensions of the matrix grow rapidly, the computational cost increases significantly, posing a serious challenge to the efficiency of data analysis and signal processing systems,especially in time-sensitive scenarios with large-scale datasets. Although various dedicated hardware architectures have been proposed to accelerate the computation of intensive SVD, many of these designs suffer from limited scalability and high consumption of on-chip memory resources. Moreover, they typically overlook the computational and data transfer challenges associated with SVD, enabling them unsuitable for real-time processing of large-scale data stream matrices in embedded systems. In this express, we propose a Data Stream-Based SVD processing algorithm (DSB Jacobi), which significantly reduces on-chip BRAM usage while improving computational speed, offering a practical solution for real-time SVD computation of large-scale data streams.

This paper bridges that gap by focusing squarely on the theoretical basis of this multi-agent algorithm.

Identifying the true source of such anomalies, known as Root Cause Localization (RCL), is essential for timely mitigation. However, existing RCL approaches are designed for cloud environments and rely on centralized analysis, which increases latency and communication overhead when applied at the edge. This paper proposes a decentralized RCL approach that executes localization directly at the edge device level using the Personalized PageRank (PPR) algorithm. The proposed method first groups microservices into communication- and colocation-aware clusters, thereby confining most anomaly propagation within cluster boundaries. Within each cluster, PPR is executed locally to identify the root cause, significantly reducing localization time. For the rare cases where anomalies propagate across clusters, we introduce an inter-cluster peer-to-peer approximation process, enabling lightweight coordination among clusters with minimal communication overhead. To enhance the accuracy of localization in heterogeneous edge environments, we also propose a novel anomaly scoring mechanism tailored to the diverse anomaly triggers that arise across microservice, device, and network layers. Evaluation results on the publicly available edge dataset, MicroCERCL, demonstrate that the proposed decentralized approach achieves comparable or higher localization accuracy than its centralized counterpart while reducing localization time by up to 34%. These findings highlight that decentralized graph-based RCL can provide a practical and efficient solution for anomaly diagnosis in resource-constrained edge environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u53bb\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316\u7684\u6839\u56e0\u5b9a\u4f4d\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u8fb9\u7f18\u8bbe\u5907\u7ea7\u522b\u4f7f\u7528\u4e2a\u6027\u5316PageRank\u7b97\u6cd5\u8fdb\u884c\u5f02\u5e38\u5b9a\u4f4d\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u5b9a\u4f4d\u65f6\u95f4\u5e76\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u9ad8\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u6839\u56e0\u5b9a\u4f4d\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u4e91\u73af\u5883\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u4f9d\u8d56\u96c6\u4e2d\u5f0f\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u5728\u8fb9\u7f18\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u4f1a\u589e\u52a0\u5ef6\u8fdf\u548c\u901a\u4fe1\u5f00\u9500\u3002\u8fb9\u7f18\u8ba1\u7b97\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u5fae\u670d\u52a1IoT\u5e94\u7528\u5bb9\u6613\u53d1\u751f\u6027\u80fd\u5f02\u5e38\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u5b9a\u4f4d\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u5fae\u670d\u52a1\u5206\u7ec4\u4e3a\u901a\u4fe1\u548c\u5171\u7f6e\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u96c6\u7fa4\uff0c\u5728\u96c6\u7fa4\u5185\u4f7f\u7528PPR\u7b97\u6cd5\u8fdb\u884c\u672c\u5730\u6839\u56e0\u5b9a\u4f4d\u3002\u5bf9\u4e8e\u8de8\u96c6\u7fa4\u5f02\u5e38\u4f20\u64ad\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u96c6\u7fa4\u95f4\u70b9\u5bf9\u70b9\u8fd1\u4f3c\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002\u8fd8\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u9488\u5bf9\u5f02\u6784\u8fb9\u7f18\u73af\u5883\u7684\u65b0\u5f02\u5e38\u8bc4\u5206\u673a\u5236\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u516c\u5f00\u8fb9\u7f18\u6570\u636e\u96c6MicroCERCL\u4e0a\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u6bd4\u96c6\u4e2d\u5f0f\u65b9\u6cd5\u51cf\u5c11\u5b9a\u4f4d\u65f6\u95f4\u8fbe34%\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u8fbe\u5230\u76f8\u5f53\u6216\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u5b9a\u4f4d\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u53bb\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u56fe\u7684\u6839\u56e0\u5b9a\u4f4d\u53ef\u4ee5\u4e3a\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u7684\u8fb9\u7f18\u73af\u5883\u63d0\u4f9b\u5b9e\u7528\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u5f02\u5e38\u8bca\u65ad\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

High-performance implementations typically rely on low-level HIP/CUDA communication libraries that demand substantial engineering effort for even basic overlap patterns, while simpler abstractions often sacrifice performance.

Iris provides tile-based symmetric memory abstractions that naturally align with Triton's programming model, enabling developers to write single-source kernels that seamlessly interleave computation and communication. We demonstrate a taxonomy of compute-communication overlap patterns--from bulk-synchronous to fine-grained workgroup specialization--that can be implemented with minimal code changes in Iris, often requiring just a few additional lines within the same Triton kernel. Our evaluation shows that Iris achieves near-optimal bandwidth utilization in microbenchmarks and delivers up to 1.79x speedup over PyTorch and RCCL for GEMM+All-Scatter workloads, demonstrating that high-level implementations can match or exceed heavily-optimized libraries while dramatically simplifying multi-GPU programming.", "AI": {"tldr": "Iris\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u5b8c\u5168\u7528Python\u548cTriton\u5b9e\u73b0\u7684\u591aGPU\u901a\u4fe1\u5e93\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7tile-based\u5bf9\u79f0\u5185\u5b58\u62bd\u8c61\u6d88\u9664\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u53ef\u7f16\u7a0b\u6027\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6743\u8861\uff0c\u4f7f\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\u80fd\u591f\u7f16\u5199\u5355\u6e90\u5185\u6838\u65e0\u7f1d\u4ea4\u7ec7\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u901a\u4fe1\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u591aGPU\u7f16\u7a0b\u9700\u8981\u5728\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u53ef\u7f16\u7a0b\u6027\u4e4b\u95f4\u8fdb\u884c\u590d\u6742\u6743\u8861\uff1a\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u9700\u8981\u4f4e\u5c42HIP/CUDA\u5e93\u4e14\u5de5\u7a0b\u91cf\u5927\uff0c\u800c\u7b80\u5355\u62bd\u8c61\u5f80\u5f80\u727a\u7272\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "Iris\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e0eTriton\u7f16\u7a0b\u6a21\u578b\u81ea\u7136\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684tile-based\u5bf9\u79f0\u5185\u5b58\u62bd\u8c61\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u4ece\u6279\u91cf\u540c\u6b65\u5230\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u5de5\u4f5c\u7ec4\u4e13\u4e1a\u5316\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97-\u901a\u4fe1\u91cd\u53e0\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u53ea\u9700\u5728\u76f8\u540cTriton\u5185\u6838\u4e2d\u6dfb\u52a0\u51e0\u884c\u4ee3\u7801\u5373\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u3002", "result": "\u8bc4\u4f30\u663e\u793aIris\u5728\u5fae\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u63a5\u8fd1\u6700\u4f18\u7684\u5e26\u5bbd\u5229\u7528\u7387\uff0c\u5728GEMM+All-Scatter\u5de5\u4f5c\u8d1f\u8f7d\u4e0a\u6bd4PyTorch\u548cRCCL\u5feb\u8fbe1.79\u500d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9ad8\u5c42\u5b9e\u73b0\u53ef\u4ee5\u5339\u914d\u6216\u8d85\u8fc7\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u5e93\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u7b80\u5316\u591aGPU\u7f16\u7a0b\u3002"}}

In this paper, we revisit the challenge of extreme LLM compression -- targeting ultra-low-bit quantization for both activations and weights -- from a Fourier frequency domain perspective. We propose SpecQuant, a two-stage framework that tackles activation outliers and cross-channel variance. In the first stage, activation outliers are smoothed and transferred into the weight matrix to simplify downstream quantization. In the second stage, we apply channel-wise low-frequency Fourier truncation to suppress high-frequency components while preserving essential signal energy, improving quantization robustness. Our method builds on the principle that most of the weight energy is concentrated in low-frequency components, which can be retained with minimal impact on model accuracy. To enable runtime adaptability, we introduce a lightweight truncation module during inference that adjusts truncation thresholds based on channel characteristics.

Ecker", "Chase van de Geijn"], "title": "Clifford Algebraic Rotor Embeddings : Maybe embeddings should start to CARE", "comment": null, "summary": "Rotary Positional Embeddings (RoPE) have demonstrated exceptional performance as a positional encoding method, consistently outperforming their baselines. While recent work has sought to extend RoPE to higher-dimensional inputs, many such extensions are non-commutative, thereby forfeiting RoPE's shift-equivariance property. Spherical RoPE is one such non-commutative variant, motivated by the idea of rotating embedding vectors on spheres rather than circles. However, spherical rotations are inherently non-commutative, making the choice of rotation sequence ambiguous. In this work, we explore a quaternion-based approach -- Quaternion Rotary Embeddings (QuatRo) -- in place of Euler angles, leveraging quaternions' ability to represent 3D rotations to parameterize the axes of rotation. We show Mixed RoPE and Spherical RoPE to be special cases of QuatRo. Further, we propose a generalization of QuatRo to Clifford Algebraic Rotary Embeddings (CARE) using geometric algebra. Viewing quaternions as the even subalgebra of Cl(3,0,0), we extend the notion of rotary embeddings from quaternions to Clifford rotors acting on multivectors. This formulation enables two key generalizations: (1) extending rotary embeddings to arbitrary dimensions, and (2) encoding positional information in multivectors of multiple grades, not just vectors. We present preliminary experiments comparing spherical, quaternion, and Clifford-based rotary embeddings.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u56db\u5143\u6570\u7684\u65cb\u8f6c\u4f4d\u7f6e\u5d4c\u5165\u65b9\u6cd5QuatRo\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u5176\u63a8\u5e7f\u5230\u57fa\u4e8e\u51e0\u4f55\u4ee3\u6570\u7684Clifford\u4ee3\u6570\u65cb\u8f6c\u5d4c\u5165CARE\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u7403\u9762RoPE\u7684\u975e\u4ea4\u6362\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4efb\u610f\u7ef4\u5ea6\u7684\u65cb\u8f6c\u4f4d\u7f6e\u7f16\u7801\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u7403\u9762RoPE\u65b9\u6cd5\u7531\u4e8e\u4f7f\u7528\u6b27\u62c9\u89d2\u8868\u793a\u65cb\u8f6c\u800c\u5177\u6709\u975e\u4ea4\u6362\u6027\uff0c\u4e27\u5931\u4e86\u539f\u59cbRoPE\u7684\u5e73\u79fb\u7b49\u53d8\u6027\u7279\u6027\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u56db\u5143\u6570\u548cClifford\u4ee3\u6570\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e2a\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "1. \u63d0\u51faQuatRo\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u56db\u5143\u6570\u4ee3\u66ff\u6b27\u62c9\u89d2\u6765\u8868\u793a3D\u65cb\u8f6c\uff1b2. \u5c06QuatRo\u63a8\u5e7f\u5230CARE\uff0c\u5229\u7528Clifford\u4ee3\u6570\u4e2d\u7684\u65cb\u8f6c\u5b50\u4f5c\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u5411\u91cf\uff1b3. \u652f\u6301\u4efb\u610f\u7ef4\u5ea6\u7684\u65cb\u8f6c\u4f4d\u7f6e\u7f16\u7801\u548c\u591a\u79cd\u7b49\u7ea7\u7684\u591a\u5411\u91cf\u4f4d\u7f6e\u4fe1\u606f\u7f16\u7801\u3002", "result": "\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86Mixed RoPE\u548cSpherical RoPE\u90fd\u662fQuatRo\u7684\u7279\u6b8a\u60c5\u51b5\u3002\u901a\u8fc7Clifford\u4ee3\u6570\u6269\u5c55\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u901a\u7528\u7684\u65cb\u8f6c\u4f4d\u7f6e\u5d4c\u5165\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "conclusion": "QuatRo\u548cCARE\u65b9\u6cd5\u6210\u529f\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u7403\u9762RoPE\u7684\u975e\u4ea4\u6362\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u65cb\u8f6c\u4f4d\u7f6e\u5d4c\u5165\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u901a\u7528\u548c\u6570\u5b66\u4e0a\u66f4\u4f18\u96c5\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u4efb\u610f\u7ef4\u5ea6\u7684\u4f4d\u7f6e\u7f16\u7801\u3002"}}

Existing stochastic gradient Markov Chain Monte Carlo (SGMCMC) methods are highly sensitive to the choice of stepsize and adaptive variants such as pSGLD typically fail to sample the correct invariant measure without addition of a costly divergence correction term. In this work, we build on the recently proposed `SamAdams' framework for timestep adaptation (Leimkuhler, Lohmann, and Whalley 2025), introducing an adaptive scheme: SA-SGLD, which employs time rescaling to modulate the stepsize according to a monitored quantity (typically the local gradient norm). SA-SGLD can automatically shrink stepsizes in regions of high curvature and expand them in flatter regions, improving both stability and mixing without introducing bias.

However, existing unlearning methods often struggle to thoroughly remove harmful knowledge, leaving residual harmful knowledge that can be easily recovered. To address these limitations, we propose Knowledge Density-Guided Unlearning via Blocks Reinsertion (KUnBR), a novel approach that first identifies layers with rich harmful knowledge and then thoroughly eliminates the harmful knowledge via re-insertion strategy. Our method introduces knowledge density estimation to quantify and locate layers containing the most harmful knowledge, enabling precise unlearning. Additionally, we design a layer re-insertion strategy that extracts and re-inserts harmful knowledge-rich layers into the original LLM, bypassing gradient obstruction caused by cover layers and ensuring effective gradient propagation during unlearning.

Traditional approaches use absolute sinusoidal embeddings or learned positional vectors, while more recent methods emphasize relative encodings to better capture translation equivariances. In this work, we propose RollPE, a novel positional encoding mechanism based on traveling waves, implemented by applying a circular roll operation to the query and key tensors in self-attention. This operation induces a relative shift in phase across positions, allowing the model to compute attention as a function of positional differences rather than absolute indices. We show this simple method significantly outperforms traditional absolute positional embeddings and is comparable to RoPE. We derive a continuous case of RollPE which implicitly imposes a topographic structure on the query and key space. We further derive a mathematical equivalence of RollPE to a particular configuration of RoPE.

Conventional optimization techniques struggle to respond effectively under dynamic edge conditions and high user loads. In this study, we explore a slice-enabled in-network edge architecture that combines computing-in-the-network (COIN) with multi-access edge computing (MEC). In addition, we formulate the joint problem of wireless and computing resource management with optimal slice selection as a mixed-integer nonlinear program (MINLP). Because solving this model online is computationally intensive, we decompose it into three sub-problems (SP1) intra-slice allocation, (SP2) inter-slice allocation, and (SP3) offloading decision and train a distributed hierarchical DeepSets-based model (DeepSets-S) on optimal solutions obtained offline. In the proposed model, we design a slack-aware normalization mechanism for a shared encoder and task-specific decoders, ensuring permutation equivariance over variable-size wireless device (WD) sets. The learned system produces near-optimal allocations with low inference time and maintains permutation equivariance over variable-size device sets. Our experimental results show that DeepSets-S attains high tolerance-based accuracies on SP1/SP2 (Acc1 = 95.26% and 95.67%) and improves multiclass offloading accuracy on SP3 (Acc = 0.7486; binary local/offload Acc = 0.8824).

The proposed model introduces a routing mechanism that allows each layer to influence how its outputs are propagated through the network, enabling iterative and adaptive computation. This concept is loosely inspired by the idea of thought processes and dynamic reasoning, where information flow is conditioned not only on the data itself, but also on the internal state of the system.\n  It is important to note that this work does not aim to compete with state-of-the-art language models in terms of performance. Instead, it presents a conceptual prototype-an architectural framework that opens up a new direction for exploring adaptable and potentially more interpretable networks. The goal is not optimization of existing benchmarks but rather the proposal of a system that can learn not only representations, but also the structure of computation itself.\n  Due to practical constraints in computing resources and data, this study remains a preliminary investigation.

The task, derived from clustering UMAP-reduced lyrical embeddings, is reframed as binary classification, distinguishing a dominant, homogeneous cluster (Class 0) from all other content (Class 1). The SFL model achieved an accuracy of 0.9894 and a Macro F1 score of 0.9894, outperforming a comprehensive Random Forest (RF) baseline that used feature concatenation (Accuracy = 0.9868). Crucially, the SFL model demonstrated vastly superior reliability and calibration, exhibiting a 93% reduction in Expected Calibration Error (ECE = 0.0035) and a 2.5x lower Log Loss (0.0304) compared to the RF baseline (ECE = 0.0500; Log Loss = 0.0772).

Although artificial intelligence (AI) substantially improves CXR-based detection, development is hindered by globally distributed data, high inter-hospital variability, and strict privacy regulations (e.g., HIPAA, GDPR) that make centralization impractical. These constraints are compounded by heterogeneous imaging protocols, uneven data availability, and the costs of transferring large medical images across geographically dispersed sites.\n  In this paper, we evaluate Federated Learning (FL) using the Sherpa.ai FL platform, enabling multiple hospitals (nodes) to collaboratively train a CXR classifier for pneumonia while keeping data in place and private. Using the Pediatric Pneumonia Chest X-ray dataset, we simulate cross-hospital collaboration with non-independent and non-identically distributed (non-IID) data, reproducing real-world variability across institutions and jurisdictions. Our experiments demonstrate that collaborative and privacy-preserving training across multiple hospitals via FL led to a dramatic performance improvement achieving 0.900 Accuracy and 0.966 ROC-AUC, corresponding to 47.5% and 50.0% gains over single-hospital models (0.610; 0.644), without transferring any patient CXR. These results indicate that FL delivers high-performing, generalizable, secure and private pneumonia detection across healthcare networks, with data kept local.

However, we observe that when sparsity exceeds a certain threshold, both iterative and one-shot pruning methods lead to a steep decline in model performance.

To overcome this limitation, we propose a bidirectional pruning-regrowth strategy. Starting from an extremely compressed network that satisfies hardware constraints, the method selectively regenerates critical connections to recover lost performance, effectively mitigating the sharp accuracy drop commonly observed under high sparsity conditions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u53cc\u5411\u526a\u679d-\u518d\u751f\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u4ece\u6781\u5ea6\u538b\u7f29\u7684\u7f51\u7edc\u5f00\u59cb\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u518d\u751f\u5173\u952e\u8fde\u63a5\u6765\u6062\u590d\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u9ad8\u7a00\u758f\u5ea6\u4e0b\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u6025\u5267\u4e0b\u964d\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u7a00\u758f\u5ea6\u8d85\u8fc7\u67d0\u4e2a\u9608\u503c\u65f6\uff0c\u8fed\u4ee3\u548c\u4e00\u6b21\u6027\u526a\u679d\u65b9\u6cd5\u90fd\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u6025\u5267\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u8fd9\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u7684\u538b\u7f29\u6bd4\uff0c\u4f7f\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u6cd5\u6ee1\u8db3\u67d0\u4e9b\u786c\u4ef6\u5e73\u53f0\u7684\u4e25\u683c\u5c3a\u5bf8\u7ea6\u675f\u3002", "method": "\u53cc\u5411\u526a\u679d-\u518d\u751f\u7b56\u7565\uff1a\u4ece\u6ee1\u8db3\u786c\u4ef6\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u6781\u5ea6\u538b\u7f29\u7f51\u7edc\u5f00\u59cb\uff0c\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u518d\u751f\u5173\u952e\u8fde\u63a5\u4ee5\u6062\u590d\u4e22\u5931\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u4e86\u9ad8\u7a00\u758f\u5ea6\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u5e38\u89c1\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u6025\u5267\u4e0b\u964d\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u53cc\u5411\u526a\u679d-\u518d\u751f\u7b56\u7565\u80fd\u591f\u514b\u670d\u4f20\u7edf\u526a\u679d\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u9ad8\u7a00\u758f\u5ea6\u4e0b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u538b\u7f29\u6bd4\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

For instance, after learning to detect traffic signs, a model may later need to learn to classify traffic lights or different types of vehicles using the same camera feed. This scenario introduces a challenging setting we term Continual Multitask Learning (CMTL), where a model sequentially learns new tasks on an underlying data distribution without forgetting previously learned abilities. Existing continual learning methods often fail in this setting because they learn fragmented, task-specific features that interfere with one another. To address this, we introduce Learning with Preserving (LwP), a novel framework that shifts the focus from preserving task outputs to maintaining the geometric structure of the shared representation space. The core of LwP is a Dynamically Weighted Distance Preservation (DWDP) loss that prevents representation drift by regularizing the pairwise distances between latent data representations. This mechanism of preserving the underlying geometric structure allows the model to retain implicit knowledge and support diverse tasks without requiring a replay buffer, making it suitable for privacy-conscious applications. Extensive evaluations on time-series and image benchmarks show that LwP not only mitigates catastrophic forgetting but also consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in CMTL tasks. Notably, our method shows superior robustness to distribution shifts and is the only approach to surpass the strong single-task learning baseline, underscoring its effectiveness for real-world dynamic environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86Learning with Preserving (LwP)\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4fdd\u6301\u5171\u4eab\u8868\u793a\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u6301\u7eed\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u707e\u96be\u6027\u9057\u5fd8\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u91cd\u653e\u7f13\u51b2\u533a\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u548c\u533b\u5b66\u5f71\u50cf\u5206\u6790\u7b49\u5173\u952e\u9886\u57df\uff0cAI\u7cfb\u7edf\u9700\u8981\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u65b0\u4efb\u52a1\u800c\u4e0d\u9057\u5fd8\u5df2\u5b66\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u56e0\u5b66\u4e60\u788e\u7247\u5316\u7279\u5f81\u800c\u5931\u8d25\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u52a8\u6001\u52a0\u6743\u8ddd\u79bb\u4fdd\u6301(DWDP)\u635f\u5931\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u6f5c\u5728\u6570\u636e\u8868\u793a\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6210\u5bf9\u8ddd\u79bb\u6765\u9632\u6b62\u8868\u793a\u6f02\u79fb\uff0c\u4fdd\u6301\u5e95\u5c42\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u548c\u56fe\u50cf\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cLwP\u4e0d\u4ec5\u7f13\u89e3\u4e86\u707e\u96be\u6027\u9057\u5fd8\uff0c\u800c\u4e14\u6301\u7eed\u4f18\u4e8e\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u662f\u552f\u4e00\u8d85\u8d8a\u5f3a\u5355\u4efb\u52a1\u5b66\u4e60\u57fa\u7ebf\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "LwP\u901a\u8fc7\u4fdd\u6301\u8868\u793a\u7a7a\u95f4\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u6301\u7eed\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u5b66\u4e60\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5bf9\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u79fb\u5177\u6709\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u7684\u73b0\u5b9e\u52a8\u6001\u73af\u5883\u3002"}}

While existing surveys describe these phenomena empirically, they lack a rigorous theoretical synthesis connecting them to the foundational limits of computation, information, and learning. This work closes that gap by presenting a unified, proof-informed framework that formalizes the innate theoretical ceilings of LLM scaling. First, computability and uncomputability imply an irreducible residue of error: for any computably enumerable model family, diagonalization guarantees inputs on which some model must fail, and undecidable queries (e.g., halting-style tasks) induce infinite failure sets for all computable predictors. Second, information-theoretic and statistical constraints bound attainable accuracy even on decidable tasks, finite description length enforces compression error, and long-tail factual knowledge requires prohibitive sample complexity. Third, geometric and computational effects compress long contexts far below their nominal size due to positional under-training, encoding attenuation, and softmax crowding. We further show how likelihood-based training favors pattern completion over inference, how retrieval under token limits suffers from semantic drift and coupling noise, and how multimodal scaling inherits shallow cross-modal alignment. Across sections, we pair theorems and empirical evidence to outline where scaling helps, where it saturates, and where it cannot progress, providing both theoretical foundations and practical mitigation paths like bounded-oracle retrieval, positional curricula, and sparse or hierarchical attention.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4ece\u8ba1\u7b97\u7406\u8bba\u3001\u4fe1\u606f\u8bba\u548c\u7edf\u8ba1\u5b66\u89d2\u5ea6\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u5206\u6790\u4e86LLM\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u4e94\u4e2a\u57fa\u672c\u9650\u5236\uff1a\u5e7b\u89c9\u3001\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u538b\u7f29\u3001\u63a8\u7406\u9000\u5316\u3001\u68c0\u7d22\u8106\u5f31\u6027\u548c\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u4e0d\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u5e76\u6307\u51fa\u4e86\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u56fa\u6709\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\u9650\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u5bf9LLM\u6269\u5c55\u9650\u5236\u7684\u63cf\u8ff0\u591a\u505c\u7559\u5728\u7ecf\u9a8c\u5c42\u9762\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5c06\u8fd9\u4e9b\u73b0\u8c61\u4e0e\u8ba1\u7b97\u3001\u4fe1\u606f\u548c\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u57fa\u672c\u7406\u8bba\u9650\u5236\u76f8\u8054\u7cfb\u7684\u4e25\u683c\u7406\u8bba\u7efc\u5408\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u586b\u8865\u8fd9\u4e00\u7a7a\u767d\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bc1\u660e\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4ece\u4e09\u4e2a\u7406\u8bba\u5c42\u9762\u5206\u6790\uff1a(1)\u53ef\u8ba1\u7b97\u6027\u548c\u4e0d\u53ef\u8ba1\u7b97\u6027\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u56fa\u6709\u8bef\u5dee\uff1b(2)\u4fe1\u606f\u8bba\u548c\u7edf\u8ba1\u7ea6\u675f\uff1b(3)\u51e0\u4f55\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u5e94\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u538b\u7f29\u3002\u7ed3\u5408\u5b9a\u7406\u548c\u5b9e\u8bc1\u8bc1\u636e\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86LLM\u6269\u5c55\u5b58\u5728\u56fa\u6709\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\u9650\uff1a\u4e0d\u53ef\u8ba1\u7b97\u4efb\u52a1\u5fc5\u7136\u5b58\u5728\u65e0\u9650\u5931\u8d25\u96c6\uff1b\u6709\u9650\u63cf\u8ff0\u957f\u5ea6\u5f3a\u5236\u538b\u7f29\u8bef\u5dee\uff1b\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u56e0\u4f4d\u7f6e\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0d\u8db3\u3001\u7f16\u7801\u8870\u51cf\u548csoftmax\u62e5\u6324\u800c\u88ab\u538b\u7f29\uff1b\u57fa\u4e8e\u4f3c\u7136\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u504f\u5411\u6a21\u5f0f\u5b8c\u6210\u800c\u975e\u63a8\u7406\u3002", "conclusion": "LLM\u6269\u5c55\u5728\u67d0\u4e9b\u65b9\u9762\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u67d0\u4e9b\u65b9\u9762\u4f1a\u9971\u548c\u751a\u81f3\u65e0\u6cd5\u8fdb\u5c55\u3002\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u7f13\u89e3\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u6709\u8fb9\u754c\u68c0\u7d22\u3001\u4f4d\u7f6e\u8bfe\u7a0b\u5b66\u4e60\u3001\u7a00\u758f\u6216\u5206\u5c42\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u7b49\u5b9e\u7528\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

This study aims to develop a comprehensive wildfire risk map for California by applying the random forest (RF) algorithm, augmented with Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) through Shapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP), to interpret model predictions. Model performance was assessed using both spatial and temporal validation strategies. The RF model demonstrated strong predictive performance, achieving near-perfect discrimination for grasslands (AUC = 0.996) and forests (AUC = 0.997). Spatial cross-validation revealed moderate transferability, yielding ROC-AUC values of 0.6155 for forests and 0.5416 for grasslands. In contrast, temporal split validation showed enhanced generalization, especially for forests (ROC-AUC = 0.6615, PR-AUC = 0.8423). SHAP-based XAI analysis identified key ecosystem-specific drivers: soil organic carbon, tree cover, and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) emerged as the most influential in forests, whereas Land Surface Temperature (LST), elevation, and vegetation health indices were dominant in grasslands. District-level classification revealed that Central Valley and Northern Buttes districts had the highest concentration of high-risk grasslands, while Northern Buttes and North Coast Redwoods dominated forested high-risk areas. This RF-SHAP framework offers a robust, comprehensible, and adaptable method for assessing wildfire risks, enabling informed decisions and creating targeted strategies to mitigate dangers.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u4f7f\u7528\u968f\u673a\u68ee\u6797\u7b97\u6cd5\u7ed3\u5408\u53ef\u89e3\u91caAI(SHAP)\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u52a0\u5dde\u91ce\u706b\u98ce\u9669\u5730\u56fe\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u4e86\u68ee\u6797\u548c\u8349\u539f\u751f\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5173\u952e\u98ce\u9669\u9a71\u52a8\u56e0\u7d20\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u91ce\u706b\u5bf9\u5168\u7403\u751f\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u6784\u6210\u91cd\u5927\u5a01\u80c1\uff0c\u52a0\u5dde\u7531\u4e8e\u6c14\u5019\u3001\u5730\u5f62\u3001\u690d\u88ab\u6a21\u5f0f\u548c\u4eba\u7c7b\u6d3b\u52a8\u7b49\u56e0\u7d20\u7ecf\u5e38\u53d1\u751f\u706b\u707e\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u5168\u9762\u7684\u91ce\u706b\u98ce\u9669\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u652f\u6301\u51b3\u7b56\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u968f\u673a\u68ee\u6797\u7b97\u6cd5\u7ed3\u5408SHAP\u53ef\u89e3\u91caAI\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u7a7a\u95f4\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7b56\u7565\u8bc4\u4f30\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u751f\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u5173\u952e\u98ce\u9669\u9a71\u52a8\u56e0\u7d20\u3002", "result": "RF\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u68ee\u6797\u548c\u8349\u539f\u7684AUC\u5206\u522b\u8fbe\u52300.997\u548c0.996\u3002SHAP\u5206\u6790\u663e\u793a\u68ee\u6797\u7684\u5173\u952e\u9a71\u52a8\u56e0\u7d20\u5305\u62ec\u571f\u58e4\u6709\u673a\u78b3\u3001\u6811\u6728\u8986\u76d6\u548cNDVI\uff0c\u800c\u8349\u539f\u7684\u5173\u952e\u9a71\u52a8\u56e0\u7d20\u5305\u62ec\u5730\u8868\u6e29\u5ea6\u3001\u6d77\u62d4\u548c\u690d\u88ab\u5065\u5eb7\u6307\u6570\u3002", "conclusion": "RF-SHAP\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u91ce\u706b\u98ce\u9669\u8bc4\u4f30\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7a33\u5065\u3001\u53ef\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u5f3a\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u652f\u6301\u77e5\u60c5\u51b3\u7b56\u548c\u5236\u5b9a\u6709\u9488\u5bf9\u6027\u7684\u98ce\u9669\u7f13\u89e3\u7b56\u7565\u3002"}}

Current deep learning approaches primarily focus on encoder-decoder architectural refinements. However, existing methodologies exhibit several limitations:(1)they rely on dilated convolutions for multi-scale context extraction, lacking the partial feature effectiveness and interoperability of inter-channel;(2)attention-based feature enhancement implementations neglect accuracy-throughput balance; and (3)the decoder modifications fail to establish global interdependencies among hierarchical local features, limiting inference efficiency. To address these challenges, we propose MPCM-Net, a Multi-scale network that integrates Partial attention Convolutions with Mamba architectures to enhance segmentation accuracy and computational efficiency. Specifically, the encoder incorporates MPAC, which comprises:(1)a MPC block with ParCM and ParSM that enables global spatial interaction across multi-scale cloud formations, and (2)a MPA block combining ParAM and ParSM to extract discriminative features with reduced computational complexity. On the decoder side, a M2B is employed to mitigate contextual loss through a SSHD that maintains linear complexity while enabling deep feature aggregation across spatial and scale dimensions. As a key contribution to the community, we also introduce and release a dataset CSRC, which is a clear-label, fine-grained segmentation benchmark designed to overcome the critical limitations of existing public datasets. Extensive experiments on CSRC demonstrate the superior performance of MPCM-Net over state-of-the-art methods, achieving an optimal balance between segmentation accuracy and inference speed.

For example, an oncologist may first conduct a breast exam, followed by a mammogram for patients with concerning exams, followed by a biopsy for patients with concerning mammograms. A key challenge is that the ground truth outcome, such as the biopsy result, is only revealed at the end of this funnel. The selective censoring of the ground truth can introduce statistical biases in risk estimation, especially in underserved patient groups, whose outcomes are more frequently censored. We develop a Bayesian model for funnel decision structures, drawing from prior work on selective labels and censoring. We first show in synthetic settings that our model is able to recover the true parameters and predict outcomes for censored patients more accurately than baselines. We then apply our model to a dataset of emergency department visits, where in-hospital mortality is observed only for those who are admitted to either the hospital or ICU. We find that there are gender-based differences in hospital and ICU admissions.

A key hurdle lies in accessing the original training data, as fine-tuning solely on new data often leads to catastrophic forgetting. To address this issue, we propose Replay Tuning (R-Tuning), a novel framework designed for the continual adaptation of pre-trained time-series models. R-Tuning constructs a unified latent space that captures both prior and current task knowledge through a frequency-aware replay strategy. Specifically, it augments model-generated samples via wavelet-based decomposition across multiple frequency bands, generating trend-preserving and fusion-enhanced variants to improve representation diversity and replay efficiency. To further reduce reliance on synthetic samples, R-Tuning introduces a latent consistency constraint that aligns new representations with the prior task space. This constraint guides joint optimization within a compact and semantically coherent latent space, ensuring robust knowledge retention and adaptation. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the superiority of R-Tuning, which reduces MAE and MSE by up to 46.9% and 46.8%, respectively, on new tasks, while preserving prior knowledge with gains of up to 5.7% and 6.0% on old tasks.

A powerful training-free strategy to accelerate this process is Schedule Optimization, which aims to find an optimal distribution of timesteps for a fixed and small Number of Function Evaluations (NFE) to maximize sample quality. To this end, a successful schedule optimization method must adhere to four core principles: effectiveness, adaptivity, practical robustness, and computational efficiency. However, existing paradigms struggle to satisfy these principles simultaneously, motivating the need for a more advanced solution. To overcome these limitations, we propose the Hierarchical-Schedule-Optimizer (HSO), a novel and efficient bi-level optimization framework. HSO reframes the search for a globally optimal schedule into a more tractable problem by iteratively alternating between two synergistic levels: an upper-level global search for an optimal initialization strategy and a lower-level local optimization for schedule refinement. This process is guided by two key innovations: the Midpoint Error Proxy (MEP), a solver-agnostic and numerically stable objective for effective local optimization, and the Spacing-Penalized Fitness (SPF) function, which ensures practical robustness by penalizing pathologically close timesteps. Extensive experiments show that HSO sets a new state-of-the-art for training-free sampling in the extremely low-NFE regime. For instance, with an NFE of just 5, HSO achieves a remarkable FID of 11.94 on LAION-Aesthetics with Stable Diffusion v2.1. Crucially, this level of performance is attained not through costly retraining, but with a one-time optimization cost of less than 8 seconds, presenting a highly practical and efficient paradigm for diffusion model acceleration.", "AI": {"tldr": "HSO\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u53cc\u5c42\u4f18\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5168\u5c40\u641c\u7d22\u548c\u5c40\u90e8\u4f18\u5316\u4ea4\u66ff\u8fdb\u884c\uff0c\u5728\u6781\u4f4eNFE\uff08\u4ec55\u6b21\uff09\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b011.94\u7684FID\uff0c\u4f18\u5316\u6210\u672c\u4e0d\u52308\u79d2\u3002", "motivation": "\u6269\u6563\u6982\u7387\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u9ad8\u4f46\u91c7\u6837\u8fc7\u7a0b\u6162\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u8c03\u5ea6\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u540c\u65f6\u6ee1\u8db3\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3001\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u3001\u5b9e\u7528\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u56db\u4e2a\u6838\u5fc3\u539f\u5219\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faHSO\u53cc\u5c42\u4f18\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff1a\u4e0a\u5c42\u5168\u5c40\u641c\u7d22\u6700\u4f18\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u4e0b\u5c42\u5c40\u90e8\u4f18\u5316\u8c03\u5ea6\u7ec6\u5316\uff1b\u5f15\u5165\u4e2d\u70b9\u8bef\u5dee\u4ee3\u7406\uff08MEP\uff09\u548c\u95f4\u8ddd\u60e9\u7f5a\u9002\u5e94\u5ea6\uff08SPF\uff09\u51fd\u6570\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6781\u4f4eNFE\uff08\u4ec55\u6b21\uff09\u4e0b\uff0cHSO\u5728LAION-Aesthetics\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fbe\u523011.94\u7684FID\uff0c\u521b\u4e0b\u65e0\u8bad\u7ec3\u91c7\u6837\u7684\u65b0SOTA\u3002", "conclusion": "HSO\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u5b9e\u7528\u7684\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u52a0\u901f\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u6602\u8d35\u91cd\u65b0\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u4e00\u6b21\u4f18\u5316\u6210\u672c\u4f4e\u4e8e8\u79d2\u3002"}}

However, tuning the learnable prompts solely based on unlabeled test data may induce prompt optimization bias, ultimately leading to suboptimal performance on downstream tasks. In this work, we analyze the underlying causes of prompt optimization bias from both the model and data perspectives. In terms of the model, the entropy minimization objective typically focuses on reducing the entropy of model predictions while overlooking their correctness. This can result in overconfident yet incorrect outputs, thereby compromising the quality of prompt optimization. On the data side, prompts affected by optimization bias can introduce misalignment between visual and textual modalities, which further aggravates the prompt optimization bias. To this end, we propose a Doubly Debiased Test-Time Prompt Tuning method. Specifically, we first introduce a dynamic retrieval-augmented modulation module that retrieves high-confidence knowledge from a dynamic knowledge base using the test image feature as a query, and uses the retrieved knowledge to modulate the predictions. Guided by the refined predictions, we further develop a reliability-aware prompt optimization module that incorporates a confidence-based weighted ensemble and cross-modal consistency distillation to impose regularization constraints during prompt tuning.

This work shows that ignoring source dynamics yields inconsistent trajectories that suppress or merge semantic cues, leading to \"semantic over-smoothing\" artifacts. As such, we reformulate text-to-3D optimization as mapping a dynamically evolving source distribution to a fixed target distribution. We cast the problem into a dual-conditioned latent space, conditioned on both the text prompt and the intermediately rendered image. Given this joint setup, we observe that the image condition naturally anchors the current source distribution. Building on this insight, we introduce AnchorDS, an improved score distillation mechanism that provides state-anchored guidance with image conditions and stabilizes generation. We further penalize erroneous source estimates and design a lightweight filter strategy and fine-tuning strategy that refines the anchor with negligible overhead. AnchorDS produces finer-grained detail, more natural colours, and stronger semantic consistency, particularly for complex prompts, while maintaining efficiency.

Our ultimate aim is to design privacy-preserving, edge-deployed, and federated AI systems that can robustly detect and understand daily routines, supporting independence and dignity in aging societies. At present, ADL-specific datasets are still under collection. As a preliminary step, we demonstrate feasibility through experiments using the SISFall dataset and its GAN-augmented variants, treating fall detection as a proxy task. We report initial results on federated learning with non-IID conditions, and embedded deployment on Jetson Orin Nano devices. We then outline open challenges such as domain shift, data scarcity, and privacy risks, and propose directions toward full ADL monitoring in smart-room environments.

MatUQ comprises 1,375 OOD prediction tasks constructed from six materials datasets using five OFM-based and a newly proposed structure-aware splitting strategy, SOAP-LOCO, which captures local atomic environments more effectively. We evaluate 12 representative GNN models under a unified uncertainty-aware training protocol that combines Monte Carlo Dropout and Deep Evidential Regression (DER), and introduce a novel uncertainty metric, D-EviU, which shows the strongest correlation with prediction errors in most tasks. Our experiments yield two key findings. First, the uncertainty-aware training approach significantly improves model prediction accuracy, reducing errors by an average of 70.6\\% across challenging OOD scenarios. Second, the benchmark reveals that no single model dominates universally: earlier models such as SchNet and ALIGNN remain competitive, while newer models like CrystalFramer and SODNet demonstrate superior performance on specific material properties.

The model adopts quantile forecasting and multi-token prediction, improving both probabilistic accuracy and inference efficiency. On the Gift-Eval benchmark, it ranks among the top pretrained models while achieving a strong trade-off between accuracy, speed, and model size. Compared to Moirai 1.0, Moirai 2.0 replaces masked-encoder training, multi-patch inputs, and mixture-distribution outputs with a simpler decoder-only architecture, single patch, and quantile loss. Ablation studies isolate these changes -- showing that the decoder-only backbone along with recursive multi-quantile decoding contribute most to the gains. Additional experiments show that Moirai 2.0 outperforms larger models from the same family and exhibits robust domain-level results. In terms of efficiency and model size, Moirai 2.0 is twice as fast and thirty times smaller than its prior best version, Moirai 1.0-Large, while also performing better.

A key challenge is to over-approximate the nonlinear activation functions with linear constraints, which can transform the verification problem into an efficiently solvable linear programming problem. Existing methods over-approximate the nonlinear parts with linear bounding planes individually, which may cause significant over-estimation and lead to lower verification accuracy. In this paper, in order to tightly enclose the three-dimensional nonlinear surface generated by the Hadamard product, we propose a novel truncated rectangular prism formed by two linear relaxation planes and a refinement-driven method to minimize both its volume and surface area for tighter over-approximation. Based on this approximation, we implement a prototype DeepPrism for RNN robustness verification. The experimental results demonstrate that \\emph{DeepPrism} has significant improvement compared with the state-of-the-art approaches in various tasks of image classification, speech recognition and sentiment analysis.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u622a\u65ad\u77e9\u5f62\u68f1\u67f1\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u7d27\u5bc6\u903c\u8fd1RNN\u4e2d\u7684Hadamard\u79ef\u751f\u6210\u7684\u4e09\u7ef4\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u66f2\u9762\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u4f53\u79ef\u548c\u8868\u9762\u79ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u7d27\u5bc6\u7684\u8fc7\u8fd1\u4f3c\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86RNN\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u6fc0\u6d3b\u51fd\u6570\u8fdb\u884c\u7ebf\u6027\u8fc7\u8fd1\u4f3c\u65f6\uff0c\u5355\u72ec\u903c\u8fd1\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u90e8\u5206\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u663e\u8457\u7684\u8fc7\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u964d\u4f4e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u7d27\u5bc6\u5730\u903c\u8fd1Hadamard\u79ef\u751f\u6210\u7684\u4e09\u7ef4\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u66f2\u9762\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u622a\u65ad\u77e9\u5f62\u68f1\u67f1\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7531\u4e24\u4e2a\u7ebf\u6027\u677e\u5f1b\u5e73\u9762\u6784\u6210\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u7ec6\u5316\u9a71\u52a8\u65b9\u6cd5\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u5176\u4f53\u79ef\u548c\u8868\u9762\u79ef\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u7d27\u5bc6\u7684\u8fc7\u8fd1\u4f3c\u3002\u57fa\u4e8e\u6b64\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86DeepPrism\u539f\u578b\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0cDeepPrism\u5728\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u7c7b\u3001\u8bed\u97f3\u8bc6\u522b\u548c\u60c5\u611f\u5206\u6790\u7b49\u591a\u79cd\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u76f8\u6bd4\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u663e\u8457\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u622a\u65ad\u77e9\u5f62\u68f1\u67f1\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u66f4\u7d27\u5bc6\u5730\u903c\u8fd1\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u66f2\u9762\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e86RNN\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

This project addresses these challenges by proposing two novel input representations: SS-only and RGB+SS, both employing semantic segmentation on RGB colour images. Experiments were conducted in deathmatches of ViZDoom, utilizing perfect segmentation results for controlled evaluation. Our results showed that SS-only was able to reduce the memory consumption of memory buffers by at least 66.6%, and up to 98.6% when a vectorisable lossless compression technique with minimal overhead such as run-length encoding is applied. Meanwhile, RGB+SS significantly enhances RL agents' performance with the additional semantic information provided. Furthermore, we explored density-based heatmapping as a tool to visualise RL agents' movement patterns and evaluate their suitability for data collection.

These models produce embeddings that can be used as analysis-ready datasets, enabling the modelling of ecosystem dynamics without extensive sensor-specific preprocessing. However, existing models typically operate at fixed spatial or temporal scales, limiting their use for ecological analyses that require both fine spatial detail and high temporal fidelity. To overcome these limitations, we propose a representation learning framework that integrates different EO modalities into a unified feature space at high spatio-temporal resolution. We introduce the framework using Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 data as representative modalities. Our approach produces a latent space at native 10 m resolution and the temporal frequency of cloud-free Sentinel-2 acquisitions. Each sensor is first modeled independently to capture its sensor-specific characteristics. Their representations are then combined into a shared model. This two-stage design enables modality-specific optimisation and easy extension to new sensors, retaining pretrained encoders while retraining only fusion layers. This enables the model to capture complementary remote sensing data and to preserve coherence across space and time. Qualitative analyses reveal that the learned embeddings exhibit high spatial and semantic consistency across heterogeneous landscapes. Quantitative evaluation in modelling Gross Primary Production reveals that they encode ecologically meaningful patterns and retain sufficient temporal fidelity to support fine-scale analyses. Overall, the proposed framework provides a flexible, analysis-ready representation learning approach for environmental applications requiring diverse spatial and temporal resolutions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5730\u7403\u89c2\u6d4b\u8868\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u9ad8\u65f6\u7a7a\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u4e0b\u6574\u5408\u4e0d\u540c\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u56fa\u5b9a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u9650\u5236\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5730\u7403\u89c2\u6d4b\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u901a\u5e38\u5728\u56fa\u5b9a\u7a7a\u95f4\u6216\u65f6\u95f4\u5c3a\u5ea6\u4e0a\u8fd0\u884c\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u9700\u8981\u7cbe\u7ec6\u7a7a\u95f4\u7ec6\u8282\u548c\u9ad8\u65f6\u95f4\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u7684\u751f\u6001\u5206\u6790\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff1a\u9996\u5148\u72ec\u7acb\u5efa\u6a21\u6bcf\u4e2a\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u4ee5\u6355\u6349\u5176\u7279\u5b9a\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u5c06\u8868\u793a\u7ec4\u5408\u5230\u5171\u4eab\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u3002\u4f7f\u7528Sentinel-1\u548cSentinel-2\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u6a21\u6001\uff0c\u572810\u7c73\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u548c\u65e0\u4e91Sentinel-2\u91c7\u96c6\u9891\u7387\u4e0b\u6784\u5efa\u7edf\u4e00\u7279\u5f81\u7a7a\u95f4\u3002", "result": "\u5b66\u4e60\u5230\u7684\u5d4c\u5165\u5728\u5f02\u8d28\u666f\u89c2\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u9ad8\u7a7a\u95f4\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u603b\u521d\u7ea7\u751f\u4ea7\u529b\u5efa\u6a21\u7684\u5b9a\u91cf\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\u7f16\u7801\u4e86\u751f\u6001\u610f\u4e49\u6a21\u5f0f\u5e76\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u8db3\u591f\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u9700\u8981\u4e0d\u540c\u7a7a\u95f4\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u7684\u73af\u5883\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7075\u6d3b\u3001\u5206\u6790\u5c31\u7eea\u7684\u8868\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

Inspired by memory consolidation in neuroscience, we propose FSC-Net (Fast-Slow Consolidation Networks), a dual-network architecture that separates rapid task learning from gradual knowledge consolidation. Our method employs a fast network (NN1) for immediate adaptation to new tasks and a slow network (NN2) that consolidates knowledge through distillation and replay. Within the family of MLP-based NN1 variants we evaluated, consolidation effectiveness is driven more by methodology than architectural embellishments -- a simple MLP outperforms more complex similarity-gated variants by 1.2pp. Through systematic hyperparameter analysis, we observed empirically that pure replay without distillation during consolidation achieves superior performance, consistent with the hypothesis that distillation from the fast network introduces recency bias. On Split-MNIST (30 seeds), FSC-Net achieves 91.71% +/- 0.62% retention accuracy, a +4.27pp gain over the fast network alone (87.43% +/- 1.27%, paired t=23.585, p < 1e-10).

This is not about criticizing existing systems, but about \\emph{understanding what reasoning requires} and \\emph{building architectures that provide it}.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u63a8\u7406\u662f\u72b6\u6001\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u8fed\u4ee3\u7b97\u5b50\u5e94\u7528\u5e76\u6536\u655b\u5230\u56fa\u5b9a\u70b9\u7684\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7OpenLM\u67b6\u6784\u5728OpenXOR\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b076%\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u800c\u73b0\u6709LLMs\u4e3a0%\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u8ba8\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u662f\u5426\u771f\u6b63\u5b66\u4f1a\u4e86\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u8fd8\u662f\u4ec5\u4ec5\u5728\u6a21\u5f0f\u5339\u914d\u63a8\u7406\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u7406\u89e3\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u672c\u8d28\u8981\u6c42\u5e76\u6784\u5efa\u76f8\u5e94\u7684\u67b6\u6784\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u63a8\u7406\u4f5c\u4e3a\u72b6\u6001\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u8fed\u4ee3\u7b97\u5b50\u5e94\u7528\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1OpenOperator\u7406\u8bba\u548cOpenLM\u67b6\u6784\u5b9e\u73b0\u3002", "result": "\u5728OpenXOR\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\uff0cOpenLM\u8fbe\u523076%\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u800c\u73b0\u6709\u6700\u5148\u8fdbLLMs\u4e3a0%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63a8\u7406\u9700\u8981\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u67b6\u6784\u652f\u6301\uff0c\u800c\u4e0d\u4ec5\u4ec5\u662f\u6a21\u5f0f\u5339\u914d\uff0cOpenLM\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u8fd9\u79cd\u67b6\u6784\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u3002"}}

By generating embeddings under multiple representation scales, the framework combines their features from different geometric views into a unified Grassmann manifold. A power-based scale sampling function is introduced to control the selection of scales and balance in- formation across resolutions.

Achieving this requires accurate modeling of the 3D temperature field to capture airflow dynamics and thermal interactions under varying operating conditions. Traditional thermal CFD solvers, while accurate, are computationally expensive and require expert-crafted meshes and boundary conditions, making them impractical for real-time use. To address these limitations, we develop a vision-based surrogate modeling framework that operates directly on a 3D voxelized representation of the data center, incorporating server workloads, fan speeds, and HVAC temperature set points. We evaluate multiple architectures, including 3D CNN U-Net variants, a 3D Fourier Neural Operator, and 3D vision transformers, to map these thermal inputs to high-fidelity heat maps. Our results show that the surrogate models generalize across data center configurations and achieve up to 20,000x speedup (hundreds of milliseconds vs. hours).

Standard Neural ODEs and physics informed variants often require orders of magnitude more iterations, and even then may converge to suboptimal solutions that fail to preserve oscillatory frequency or amplitude. We introduce PhysicsInformed Neural ODEs with with Scale-Aware Residuals (PI-NODE-SR), a framework that combines a low-order explicit solver (Heun method) residual normalisation to balance contributions between state variables evolving on disparate timescales. This combination stabilises training under realistic iteration budgets and avoids reliance on computationally expensive implicit solvers. On the Hodgkin-Huxley equations, PI-NODE-SR learns from a single oscillation simulated with a stiff solver (Rodas5P) and extrapolates beyond 100 ms, capturing both oscillation frequency and near-correct amplitudes. Remarkably, end-to-end learning of the vector field enables PI-NODE-SR to recover morphological features such as sharp subthreshold curvature in gating variables that are typically reserved for higher-order solvers, suggesting that neural correction can offset numerical diffusion. While performance remains sensitive to initialisation, PI-NODE-SR consistently reduces long-horizon errors relative to baseline Neural-ODEs and PINNs, offering a principled route to stable and efficient learning of stiff biological dynamics.", "AI": {"tldr": "PI-NODE-SR\u7ed3\u5408\u4f4e\u9636\u663e\u5f0f\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u548c\u6b8b\u5dee\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\uff0c\u7a33\u5b9a\u5730\u5b66\u4e60\u521a\u6027\u751f\u7269\u7269\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5728\u6709\u9650\u8fed\u4ee3\u9884\u7b97\u4e0b\u51c6\u786e\u9884\u6d4b\u632f\u8361\u9891\u7387\u548c\u5e45\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u6807\u51c6\u795e\u7ecf\u5fae\u5206\u65b9\u7a0b\u548c\u7269\u7406\u4fe1\u606f\u53d8\u4f53\u5728\u5efa\u6a21\u521a\u6027\u751f\u7269\u7269\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\u65f6\u4e0d\u53ef\u9760\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5927\u91cf\u8fed\u4ee3\u4e14\u53ef\u80fd\u6536\u655b\u5230\u6b21\u4f18\u89e3\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u4fdd\u6301\u632f\u8361\u9891\u7387\u6216\u5e45\u5ea6\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u5177\u6709\u5c3a\u5ea6\u611f\u77e5\u6b8b\u5dee\u7684\u7269\u7406\u4fe1\u606f\u795e\u7ecfODE\uff08PI-NODE-SR\uff09\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408Heun\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u6b8b\u5dee\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u6765\u5e73\u8861\u4e0d\u540c\u65f6\u95f4\u5c3a\u5ea6\u72b6\u6001\u53d8\u91cf\u7684\u8d21\u732e\u3002", "result": "\u5728Hodgkin-Huxley\u65b9\u7a0b\u4e0a\uff0cPI-NODE-SR\u4ece\u5355\u4e2a\u632f\u8361\u5b66\u4e60\u5e76\u5916\u63a8\u8d85\u8fc7100ms\uff0c\u51c6\u786e\u6355\u6349\u632f\u8361\u9891\u7387\u548c\u63a5\u8fd1\u6b63\u786e\u7684\u5e45\u5ea6\uff0c\u6062\u590d\u95e8\u63a7\u53d8\u91cf\u4e2d\u7684\u5c16\u9510\u4e9a\u9608\u503c\u66f2\u7387\u7b49\u5f62\u6001\u7279\u5f81\u3002", "conclusion": "PI-NODE-SR\u76f8\u5bf9\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u795e\u7ecfODE\u548cPINNs\u6301\u7eed\u51cf\u5c11\u957f\u65f6\u7a0b\u8bef\u5dee\uff0c\u4e3a\u7a33\u5b9a\u9ad8\u6548\u5b66\u4e60\u521a\u6027\u751f\u7269\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u539f\u5219\u6027\u9014\u5f84\u3002"}}

Although rule-based heuristics can generate labels at scale, they are noisy and coarse-grained, limiting the accuracy of purely data-driven approaches. To address this, we propose DK-Root, a joint data-and-knowledge-driven framework that unifies scalable weak supervision with precise expert guidance for robust root-cause analysis. DK-Root first pretrains an encoder via contrastive representation learning using abundant rule-based labels while explicitly denoising their noise through a supervised contrastive objective. To supply task-faithful data augmentation, we introduce a class-conditional diffusion model that generates KPIs sequences preserving root-cause semantics, and by controlling reverse diffusion steps, it produces weak and strong augmentations that improve intra-class compactness and inter-class separability. Finally, the encoder and the lightweight classifier are jointly fine-tuned with scarce expert-verified labels to sharpen decision boundaries. Extensive experiments on a real-world, operator-grade dataset demonstrate state-of-the-art accuracy, with DK-Root surpassing traditional ML and recent semi-supervised time-series methods.

We present a curiosity-driven quantized Mixture-of-Experts framework that addresses both through Bayesian epistemic uncertainty-based routing across heterogeneous experts (BitNet ternary, 1-16 bit BitLinear, post-training quantization). Evaluated on audio classification benchmarks (ESC-50, Quinn, UrbanSound8K), our 4-bit quantization maintains 99.9 percent of 16-bit accuracy (0.858 vs 0.859 F1) with 4x compression and 41 percent energy savings versus 8-bit. Crucially, curiosity-driven routing reduces MoE latency variance by 82 percent (p = 0.008, Levene's test) from 230 ms to 29 ms standard deviation, enabling stable inference for battery-constrained devices. Statistical analysis confirms 4-bit/8-bit achieve practical equivalence with full precision (p > 0.05), while MoE architectures introduce 11 percent latency overhead (p < 0.001) without accuracy gains. At scale, deployment emissions dominate training by 10000x for models serving more than 1,000 inferences, making inference efficiency critical. Our information-theoretic routing demonstrates that adaptive quantization yields accurate (0.858 F1, 1.2M params), energy-efficient (3.87 F1/mJ), and predictable edge models, with simple 4-bit quantized architectures outperforming complex MoE for most deployments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u597d\u5947\u5fc3\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u91cf\u5316\u6df7\u5408\u4e13\u5bb6\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u8ba4\u77e5\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u8def\u7531\u5728\u5f02\u6784\u4e13\u5bb6\u95f4\u5206\u914d\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u5ef6\u8fdf\u65b9\u5dee\u548c\u80fd\u8017\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u8bbe\u5907\u4e0a\u90e8\u7f72\u6df1\u5ea6\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u4e24\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u6311\u6218\uff1a\u5728\u6fc0\u8fdb\u91cf\u5316\u4e0b\u4fdd\u6301\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u786e\u4fdd\u53ef\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u5ef6\u8fdf\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u597d\u5947\u5fc3\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u91cf\u5316\u6df7\u5408\u4e13\u5bb6\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u8ba4\u77e5\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u5728\u5f02\u6784\u4e13\u5bb6\uff08BitNet\u4e09\u5143\u30011-16\u4f4dBitLinear\u3001\u8bad\u7ec3\u540e\u91cf\u5316\uff09\u4e4b\u95f4\u8fdb\u884c\u8def\u7531\u3002", "result": "4\u4f4d\u91cf\u5316\u4fdd\u630199.9%\u768416\u4f4d\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff080.858 vs 0.859 F1\uff09\uff0c\u538b\u7f29\u6bd44\u500d\uff0c\u80fd\u8017\u8282\u770141%\u3002\u597d\u5947\u5fc3\u9a71\u52a8\u8def\u7531\u5c06MoE\u5ef6\u8fdf\u65b9\u5dee\u964d\u4f4e82%\uff08\u4ece230ms\u523029ms\u6807\u51c6\u5dee\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u91cf\u5316\u53ef\u4ea7\u751f\u51c6\u786e\u3001\u8282\u80fd\u4e14\u53ef\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u8fb9\u7f18\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7b80\u5355\u76844\u4f4d\u91cf\u5316\u67b6\u6784\u5728\u5927\u591a\u6570\u90e8\u7f72\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u4f18\u4e8e\u590d\u6742\u7684MoE\u67b6\u6784\u3002"}}

Starting from basic properties of Gaussian distributions (densities, quadratic expectations, re-parameterisation, products, and KL divergences), we construct denoising diffusion probabilistic models from first principles. This includes the forward noising process, its closed-form marginals, the exact discrete reverse posterior, and the related variational bound. This bound simplifies to the standard noise-prediction goal used in practice. We then discuss likelihood estimation and accelerated sampling, covering DDIM, adversarially learned reverse dynamics (DDGAN), and multi-scale variants such as nested and latent diffusion, with Stable Diffusion as a canonical example. A continuous-time formulation follows, in which we derive the probability-flow ODE from the diffusion SDE via the continuity and Fokker-Planck equations, introduce flow matching, and show how rectified flows recover DDIM up to a time re-parameterisation. Finally, we treat guided diffusion, interpreting classifier guidance as a posterior score correction and classifier-free guidance as a principled interpolation between conditional and unconditional scores. Throughout, the focus is on transparent algebra, explicit intermediate steps, and consistent notation, so that readers can both follow the theory and implement the corresponding algorithms in practice.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6269\u6563\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7b80\u660e\u81ea\u5305\u542b\u63a8\u5bfc\uff0c\u4ece\u9ad8\u65af\u5206\u5e03\u57fa\u672c\u6027\u8d28\u51fa\u53d1\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u53bb\u566a\u6269\u6563\u6982\u7387\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u6db5\u76d6\u4e86\u524d\u5411\u52a0\u566a\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3001\u53cd\u5411\u540e\u9a8c\u5206\u5e03\u3001\u53d8\u5206\u4e0b\u754c\u7b49\u6838\u5fc3\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u5e76\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u8fde\u7eed\u65f6\u95f4\u516c\u5f0f\u3001\u52a0\u901f\u91c7\u6837\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u5f15\u5bfc\u6269\u6563\u6280\u672f\u3002", "motivation": "\u65e8\u5728\u4e3a\u6269\u6563\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u900f\u660e\u3001\u81ea\u5305\u542b\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u63a8\u5bfc\uff0c\u4f7f\u8bfb\u8005\u80fd\u591f\u540c\u65f6\u7406\u89e3\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u5e76\u5b9e\u73b0\u76f8\u5e94\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u586b\u8865\u73b0\u6709\u6587\u732e\u4e2d\u7406\u8bba\u63a8\u5bfc\u4e0d\u591f\u7cfb\u7edf\u5b8c\u6574\u7684\u7a7a\u767d\u3002", "method": "\u4ece\u9ad8\u65af\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u57fa\u672c\u6027\u8d28\u51fa\u53d1\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u63a8\u5bfc\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6838\u5fc3\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff1a\u524d\u5411\u52a0\u566a\u8fc7\u7a0b\u53ca\u5176\u95ed\u5f0f\u8fb9\u9645\u5206\u5e03\u3001\u7cbe\u786e\u79bb\u6563\u53cd\u5411\u540e\u9a8c\u5206\u5e03\u3001\u53d8\u5206\u4e0b\u754c\uff0c\u5e76\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u8fde\u7eed\u65f6\u95f4\u516c\u5f0f\uff08\u6982\u7387\u6d41ODE\u3001Fokker-Planck\u65b9\u7a0b\uff09\u3001\u52a0\u901f\u91c7\u6837\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08DDIM\u3001DDGAN\u3001\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u53d8\u4f53\uff09\u548c\u5f15\u5bfc\u6269\u6563\u6280\u672f\u3002", "result": "\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u5b8c\u6574\u7684\u6269\u6563\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u53d8\u5206\u4e0b\u754c\u7b80\u5316\u4e3a\u5b9e\u8df5\u4e2d\u4f7f\u7528\u7684\u566a\u58f0\u9884\u6d4b\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u63a8\u5bfc\u4e86\u6982\u7387\u6d41ODE\u4e0e\u6269\u6563SDE\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u6574\u6d41\u6d41\u5982\u4f55\u6062\u590dDDIM\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u5f15\u5bfc\u548c\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u65e0\u5173\u5f15\u5bfc\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u89e3\u91ca\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u900f\u660e\u7684\u4ee3\u6570\u63a8\u5bfc\u3001\u660e\u786e\u7684\u4e2d\u95f4\u6b65\u9aa4\u548c\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u7b26\u53f7\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u4e3a\u6269\u6563\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7cfb\u7edf\u5b8c\u6574\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u4f7f\u8bfb\u8005\u80fd\u591f\u6df1\u5165\u7406\u89e3\u6a21\u578b\u539f\u7406\u5e76\u5b9e\u73b0\u76f8\u5e94\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002"}}

However, distribution shifts arising from the complex and dynamic nature of TC environmental fields, such as varying geographical conditions and seasonal changes, present significant challenges to reliable estimation. Most existing methods rely on multi-modal fusion for feature extraction but overlook the intrinsic distribution of feature representations, leading to poor generalization under out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios. To address this, we propose an effective Identity Distribution-Oriented Physical Invariant Learning framework (IDOL), which imposes identity-oriented constraints to regulate the feature space under the guidance of prior physical knowledge, thereby dealing distribution variability with physical invariance. Specifically, the proposed IDOL employs the wind field model and dark correlation knowledge of TC to model task-shared and task-specific identity tokens. These tokens capture task dependencies and intrinsic physical invariances of TC, enabling robust estimation of TC wind speed, pressure, inner-core, and outer-core size under distribution shifts. Extensive experiments conducted on multiple datasets and tasks demonstrate the outperformance of the proposed IDOL, verifying that imposing identity-oriented constraints based on prior physical knowledge can effectively mitigates diverse distribution shifts in TC estimation.Code is available at https://github.com/Zjut-MultimediaPlus/IDOL.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faIDOL\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7269\u7406\u5148\u9a8c\u77e5\u8bc6\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u8eab\u4efd\u7ea6\u675f\u6765\u5904\u7406\u70ed\u5e26\u6c14\u65cb\u4f30\u8ba1\u4e2d\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u79fb\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u5728\u5206\u5e03\u5916\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u70ed\u5e26\u6c14\u65cb\u4f30\u8ba1\u9762\u4e34\u590d\u6742\u52a8\u6001\u73af\u5883\u573a\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u79fb\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5ffd\u89c6\u7279\u5f81\u8868\u793a\u7684\u5185\u5728\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5728\u5206\u5e03\u5916\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u5dee\u3002", "method": "IDOL\u6846\u67b6\u5229\u7528\u98ce\u573a\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u6697\u76f8\u5173\u77e5\u8bc6\u5efa\u6a21\u4efb\u52a1\u5171\u4eab\u548c\u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u8eab\u4efd\u4ee4\u724c\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7269\u7406\u4e0d\u53d8\u6027\u7ea6\u675f\u7279\u5f81\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u5904\u7406\u5206\u5e03\u53d8\u5f02\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660eIDOL\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u7269\u7406\u5148\u9a8c\u77e5\u8bc6\u7684\u8eab\u4efd\u7ea6\u675f\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u70ed\u5e26\u6c14\u65cb\u4f30\u8ba1\u4e2d\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u79fb\u3002", "conclusion": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u7269\u7406\u5148\u9a8c\u77e5\u8bc6\u7684\u8eab\u4efd\u5bfc\u5411\u7ea6\u675f\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u5904\u7406\u70ed\u5e26\u6c14\u65cb\u4f30\u8ba1\u4e2d\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u53d8\u5f02\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5206\u5e03\u5916\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002"}}

Such unfairness might arise from biased training data, model design, or representational disparities across groups, posing significant challenges in high-stakes decision-making domains such as college admissions. While existing fair learning models aim to mitigate bias, achieving an optimal trade-off between fairness and accuracy remains a challenge. Moreover, the reliance on black-box models hinders interpretability, limiting their applicability in socially sensitive domains. In this paper, we try to circumvent these issues by integrating Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) within a fair adversarial learning framework. Leveraging the adversarial robustness and interpretability of KANs, our approach enables a balance between fairness and accuracy. To further facilitate this balance, we propose an adaptive penalty update mechanism that dynamically adjusts fairness constraints during the model training. We conduct numerical experiments on two real-world college admissions datasets, across three different optimization strategies. The results demonstrate the efficiency and robustness of KANs by consistently outperforming the baseline fair learning models, and maintaining high predictive accuracy while achieving competitive fairness across sensitive attributes.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u5c06Kolmogorov-Arnold\u7f51\u7edc\uff08KANs\uff09\u96c6\u6210\u5230\u516c\u5e73\u5bf9\u6297\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\u4e2d\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u60e9\u7f5a\u66f4\u65b0\u673a\u5236\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u516c\u5e73\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u516c\u5e73\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6743\u8861\u4ecd\u5177\u6311\u6218\u6027\uff0c\u4e14\u9ed1\u76d2\u6a21\u578b\u7f3a\u4e4f\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5728\u654f\u611f\u9886\u57df\uff08\u5982\u5927\u5b66\u5f55\u53d6\uff09\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u5c06KANs\u96c6\u6210\u5230\u516c\u5e73\u5bf9\u6297\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\u4e2d\uff0c\u5229\u7528KANs\u7684\u5bf9\u6297\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u60e9\u7f5a\u66f4\u65b0\u673a\u5236\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u8bad\u7ec3\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u516c\u5e73\u7ea6\u675f\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u5927\u5b66\u5f55\u53d6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4e09\u79cd\u4e0d\u540c\u4f18\u5316\u7b56\u7565\u4e0b\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u516c\u5e73\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u8de8\u654f\u611f\u5c5e\u6027\u7684\u7ade\u4e89\u6027\u516c\u5e73\u3002", "conclusion": "KANs\u5728\u516c\u5e73\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u9ad8\u6548\u6027\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5e73\u8861\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u654f\u611f\u51b3\u7b56\u9886\u57df\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

We propose a novel strategy where we combine multiple LLM models with varying cost/accuracy tradeoffs in an agentic manner, where models and tools are run in sequence as determined by an orchestration model to minimize cost subject to a user-specified level of reliability; this constraint is formalized using conformal prediction to provide guarantees. To solve this problem, we propose Conformal Constrained Policy Optimization (CCPO), a training paradigm that integrates constrained policy optimization with off-policy reinforcement learning and recent advances in online conformal prediction. CCPO jointly optimizes a cost-aware policy (score function) and an adaptive threshold. Across two multi-hop question answering benchmarks, CCPO achieves up to a 30% cost reduction compared to other cost-aware baselines and LLM-guided methods without compromising reliability.

This paper investigates \\textit{Volatility in Certainty} (VC), a recently proposed, label-free metric that quantifies irregularities in model confidence by measuring the dispersion of sorted softmax outputs. Specifically, VC is defined as the average squared log-ratio of adjacent certainty values, capturing local fluctuations in model output smoothness. We evaluate VC as a proxy for classification accuracy and as an indicator of adversarial drift. Experiments are conducted on artificial neural networks (ANNs) and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) trained on MNIST, as well as a regularized VGG-like model trained on CIFAR-10. Adversarial examples are generated using the Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM) across varying perturbation magnitudes. In addition, mixed test sets are created by gradually introducing adversarial contamination to assess VC's sensitivity under incremental distribution shifts. Our results reveal a strong negative correlation between classification accuracy and log(VC) (correlation rho < -0.90 in most cases), suggesting that VC effectively reflects performance degradation without requiring labeled data.

We investigate the strategic effect of transparency for agents through the lens of transferable adversarial example attacks. In transferable adversarial example attacks, attackers maliciously perturb their inputs using surrogate models to fool a defender's target model. These models can be defended or undefended, with both players having to decide which to use. Using a large-scale empirical evaluation of nine attacks across 181 models, we find that attackers are more successful when they match the defender's decision; hence, obscurity could be beneficial to the defender. With game theory, we analyze this trade-off between transparency and security by modeling this problem as both a Nash game and a Stackelberg game, and comparing the expected outcomes. Our analysis confirms that only knowing whether a defender's model is defended or not can sometimes be enough to damage its security.

While Eddy Covariance (EC) towers provide high-frequency estimates, their limited spatial coverage constrains large-scale assessments. Remote sensing offers a scalable alternative, yet most approaches rely on single-sensor spectral indices and statistical models that are often unable to capture the complex temporal dynamics of GPP. Recent advances in deep learning (DL) and data fusion offer new opportunities to better represent the temporal dynamics of vegetation processes, but comparative evaluations of state-of-the-art DL models for multimodal GPP prediction remain scarce. Here, we explore the performance of two representative models for predicting GPP: 1) GPT-2, a transformer architecture, and 2) Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), a recurrent neural network, using multivariate inputs. Overall, both achieve similar accuracy. But, while LSTM performs better overall, GPT-2 excels during extreme events. Analysis of temporal context length further reveals that LSTM attains similar accuracy using substantially shorter input windows than GPT-2, highlighting an accuracy-efficiency trade-off between the two architectures. Feature importance analysis reveals radiation as the dominant predictor, followed by Sentinel-2, MODIS land surface temperature, and Sentinel-1 contributions.

Adversarial learning, particularly through self-play, offers a promising alternative that enables models to iteratively learn from themselves - thus reducing reliance on external supervision. Dual-play extends adversarial learning by assigning specialized roles to two models and training them against each other, fostering sustained competition and mutual evolution. Despite its promise, adapting dual-play training to LLMs remains limited, largely due to their susceptibility to reward hacking and training instability. In this paper, we introduce PasoDoble, a novel LLM dual-play framework. PasoDoble adversarially trains two models initialized from the same base model: a Proposer, which generates challenging questions with ground-truth answers, and a Solver, which attempts to solve them. We enrich the Proposer with knowledge from a pre-training dataset to ensure the questions' quality and diversity. To avoid reward hacking, the Proposer is rewarded for producing only valid questions that push the Solver's limit, while the Solver is rewarded for solving them correctly, and both are updated jointly. To further enhance training stability, we introduce an optional offline paradigm that decouples Proposer and Solver updates, alternately updating each for several steps while holding the other fixed. Notably, PasoDoble operates without supervision during training.

Preprint under review", "summary": "Machine learning models achieve state-of-the-art performance across domains, yet their lack of interpretability limits safe deployment in high-stakes settings. Counterfactual explanations are widely used to provide actionable \"what-if\" recourse, but they typically remain instance-specific and do not quantify which features systematically drive outcome changes within coherent regions of the feature space or across an entire dataset. We introduce FLEX (Feature importance from Layered counterfactual EXplanations), a model- and domain-agnostic framework that converts sets of counterfactuals into feature change frequency scores at local, regional, and global levels. FLEX generalises local change-frequency measures by aggregating across instances and neighbourhoods, offering interpretable rankings that reflect how often each feature must change to flip predictions. The framework is compatible with different counterfactual generation methods, allowing users to emphasise characteristics such as sparsity, feasibility, or actionability, thereby tailoring the derived feature importances to practical constraints. We evaluate FLEX on two contrasting tabular tasks: traffic accident severity prediction and loan approval, and compare FLEX to SHAP- and LIME-derived feature importance values. Results show that (i) FLEX's global rankings correlate with SHAP while surfacing additional drivers, and (ii) regional analyses reveal context-specific factors that global summaries miss.

Diffusion-based models, particularly latent diffusion models (LDMs), have recently shown promise by performing stochastic search in a continuous latent space that compactly captures molecular semantics. Yet existing methods rely on one-shot conditioning, where the entire prompt is encoded once and applied throughout diffusion, making it hard to satisfy all the requirements in the prompt. We discuss three outstanding challenges of one-shot conditioning generation, including the poor interpretability of the generated components, the failure to generate all substructures, and the overambition in considering all requirements simultaneously. We then propose three principles to address those challenges, motivated by which we propose Chain-of-Generation (CoG), a training-free multi-stage latent diffusion framework. CoG decomposes each prompt into curriculum-ordered semantic segments and progressively incorporates them as intermediate goals, guiding the denoising trajectory toward molecules that satisfy increasingly rich linguistic constraints. To reinforce semantic guidance, we further introduce a post-alignment learning phase that strengthens the correspondence between textual and molecular latent spaces. Extensive experiments on benchmark and real-world tasks demonstrate that CoG yields higher semantic alignment, diversity, and controllability than one-shot baselines, producing molecules that more faithfully reflect complex, compositional prompts while offering transparent insight into the generation process.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faChain-of-Generation (CoG)\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u9636\u6bb5\u6f5c\u5728\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u89e3\u51b3\u6587\u672c\u6761\u4ef6\u5206\u5b50\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u4e00\u6b21\u6027\u6761\u4ef6\u7f16\u7801\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u8bed\u4e49\u5bf9\u9f50\u548c\u53ef\u63a7\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u7684\u5206\u5b50\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u91c7\u7528\u4e00\u6b21\u6027\u6761\u4ef6\u7f16\u7801\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u6ee1\u8db3\u63d0\u793a\u4e2d\u7684\u6240\u6709\u8981\u6c42\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u751f\u6210\u7ec4\u4ef6\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u5dee\u3001\u65e0\u6cd5\u751f\u6210\u6240\u6709\u5b50\u7ed3\u6784\u3001\u540c\u65f6\u8003\u8651\u6240\u6709\u8981\u6c42\u8fc7\u4e8e\u6fc0\u8fdb\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faCoG\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1\uff09\u5c06\u63d0\u793a\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u8bfe\u7a0b\u6392\u5e8f\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u7247\u6bb5\uff1b2\uff09\u9010\u6b65\u5c06\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7247\u6bb5\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e2d\u95f4\u76ee\u6807\uff1b3\uff09\u5f15\u5165\u540e\u5bf9\u9f50\u5b66\u4e60\u9636\u6bb5\u52a0\u5f3a\u6587\u672c\u548c\u5206\u5b50\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u5bf9\u5e94\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u57fa\u51c6\u548c\u5b9e\u9645\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cCoG\u6bd4\u4e00\u6b21\u6027\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u8bed\u4e49\u5bf9\u9f50\u3001\u591a\u6837\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u63a7\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u597d\uff0c\u80fd\u66f4\u5fe0\u5b9e\u5730\u53cd\u6620\u590d\u6742\u7ec4\u5408\u63d0\u793a\u3002", "conclusion": "CoG\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u9636\u6bb5\u751f\u6210\u8fc7\u7a0b\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u6587\u672c\u6761\u4ef6\u5206\u5b50\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u900f\u660e\u548c\u53ef\u63a7\u7684\u751f\u6210\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002"}}

To address these issues, we propose a novel gradient-free training algorithm, the Bidirectional Subspace Rotation Algorithm (B-SRA), which significantly improves the robustness and convergence behavior of BAM. Through comprehensive experiments, we identify two key principles -- orthogonal weight matrices (OWM) and gradient-pattern alignment (GPA) -- as central to enhancing the robustness of BAM. Motivated by these findings, we introduce new regularization strategies into B-BP, resulting in models with greatly improved resistance to corruption and adversarial perturbations. We further conduct an ablation study across different training strategies to determine the most robust configuration and evaluate BAM's performance under a variety of attack scenarios and memory capacities, including 50, 100, and 200 associative pairs. Among all methods, the SAME configuration, which integrates both OWM and GPA, achieves the strongest resilience.

As models scale up, pretrained graph models have become valuable intellectual assets because they encode extensive computation and domain expertise. Building on these advances, Graph Foundation Models (GFMs) mark a major step forward by jointly pretraining graph and text encoders on massive and diverse data. This unifies structural and semantic understanding, enables zero-shot inference, and supports applications such as fraud detection and biomedical analysis. However, the high pretraining cost and broad cross-domain knowledge in GFMs also make them attractive targets for model extraction attacks (MEAs). Prior work has focused only on small graph neural networks trained on a single graph, leaving the security implications for large-scale and multimodal GFMs largely unexplored. This paper presents the first systematic study of MEAs against GFMs. We formalize a black-box threat model and define six practical attack scenarios covering domain-level and graph-specific extraction goals, architectural mismatch, limited query budgets, partial node access, and training data discrepancies. To instantiate these attacks, we introduce a lightweight extraction method that trains an attacker encoder using supervised regression of graph embeddings. Even without contrastive pretraining data, this method learns an encoder that stays aligned with the victim text encoder and preserves its zero-shot inference ability on unseen graphs. Experiments on seven datasets show that the attacker can approximate the victim model using only a tiny fraction of its original training cost, with almost no loss in accuracy. These findings reveal that GFMs greatly expand the MEA surface and highlight the need for deployment-aware security defenses in large-scale graph learning systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u9996\u6b21\u7cfb\u7edf\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u9488\u5bf9\u56fe\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b(GFMs)\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u53d6\u653b\u51fb(MEAs)\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86GFMs\u663e\u8457\u6269\u5927\u4e86MEA\u7684\u653b\u51fb\u9762\uff0c\u653b\u51fb\u8005\u4ec5\u9700\u539f\u59cb\u8bad\u7ec3\u6210\u672c\u7684\u6781\u5c0f\u90e8\u5206\u5c31\u80fd\u8fd1\u4f3c\u53d7\u5bb3\u8005\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4e14\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u51e0\u4e4e\u65e0\u635f\u5931\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u56fe\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u56fe\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b(GFMs)\u56e0\u5176\u8054\u5408\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u56fe\u548c\u6587\u672c\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u3001\u652f\u6301\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u63a8\u7406\u7b49\u80fd\u529b\u800c\u6210\u4e3a\u91cd\u8981\u8d44\u4ea7\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u9ad8\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6210\u672c\u548c\u8de8\u9886\u57df\u77e5\u8bc6\u4e5f\u4f7f\u5176\u6210\u4e3a\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u53d6\u653b\u51fb\u7684\u6709\u5438\u5f15\u76ee\u6807\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u4ec5\u5173\u6ce8\u5c0f\u578b\u56fe\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u5bf9\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u591a\u6a21\u6001GFMs\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u5f71\u54cd\u5c1a\u672a\u63a2\u7d22\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u63d0\u53d6\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u76d1\u7763\u56de\u5f52\u56fe\u5d4c\u5165\u6765\u8bad\u7ec3\u653b\u51fb\u8005\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u65e0\u9700\u5bf9\u6bd4\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5373\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u4e0e\u53d7\u5bb3\u8005\u6587\u672c\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u4fdd\u6301\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u672a\u89c1\u56fe\u4e0a\u4fdd\u6301\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e86\u516d\u79cd\u5b9e\u9645\u653b\u51fb\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u9886\u57df\u7ea7\u548c\u56fe\u7279\u5b9a\u63d0\u53d6\u76ee\u6807\u3001\u67b6\u6784\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u3001\u6709\u9650\u67e5\u8be2\u9884\u7b97\u3001\u90e8\u5206\u8282\u70b9\u8bbf\u95ee\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e03\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u653b\u51fb\u8005\u4ec5\u9700\u539f\u59cb\u8bad\u7ec3\u6210\u672c\u7684\u6781\u5c0f\u90e8\u5206\u5c31\u80fd\u8fd1\u4f3c\u53d7\u5bb3\u8005\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u51e0\u4e4e\u65e0\u635f\u5931\u3002", "conclusion": "GFMs\u663e\u8457\u6269\u5927\u4e86MEA\u7684\u653b\u51fb\u9762\uff0c\u7a81\u663e\u4e86\u5728\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u56fe\u5b66\u4e60\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u90e8\u7f72\u611f\u77e5\u5b89\u5168\u9632\u5fa1\u7684\u5fc5\u8981\u6027\u3002"}}

Rather, most references express gradients per sample or rely on automatic differentiation. Although automatic differentiation can achieve equally high computational efficiency, the usage of batch matrix-form makes the computational structure explicit, which is essential for transparent, systematic analysis, and optimization in settings such as sparse neural networks. This paper fills that gap by providing a mathematically rigorous and implementation-ready specification of MLPs in batch matrix-form. We derive forward and backward equations for all standard and advanced layers, including batch normalization and softmax, and validate all equations using the symbolic mathematics library SymPy. From these specifications, we construct uniform reference implementations in NumPy, PyTorch, JAX, TensorFlow, and a high-performance C++ backend optimized for sparse operations. Our main contributions are: (1) a complete derivation of batch matrix-form backpropagation for MLPs, (2) symbolic validation of all gradient equations, (3) uniform Python and C++ reference implementations grounded in a small set of matrix primitives, and (4) demonstration of how explicit formulations enable efficient sparse computation.

While it is natural to default to Laplacian spectral embeddings, which capture meaningful graph connectivity information, we ask whether spectral embeddings from alternative graph matrices can also provide useful representations for learning. We introduce Interpolated Laplacian Embeddings (ILEs), which are derived from a simple yet expressive family of graph matrices. Using tools from spectral graph theory, we offer a straightforward interpretation of the structural information that ILEs capture.

Brockmeier"], "title": "A Systematic Analysis of Out-of-Distribution Detection Under Representation and Training Paradigm Shifts", "comment": null, "summary": "We present a systematic comparison of out-of-distribution (OOD) detection methods across CLIP-stratified regimes using AURC and AUGRC as primary metrics. Experiments cover two representation paradigms: CNNs trained from scratch and a fine-tuned Vision Transformer (ViT), evaluated on CIFAR-10/100, SuperCIFAR-100, and TinyImageNet. Using a multiple-comparison-controlled, rank-based pipeline (Friedman test with Conover-Holm post-hoc) and Bron-Kerbosch cliques, we find that the learned feature space largely determines OOD efficacy. For both CNNs and ViTs, probabilistic scores (e.g., MSR, GEN) dominate misclassification (ID) detection.

Extreme $Q$-Learning (XQL) is a recent offline RL method that models Bellman errors using the Extreme Value Theorem, yielding strong empirical performance. However, XQL and its stabilized variant MXQL suffer from notable limitations: both require extensive hyperparameter tuning specific to each dataset and domain, and also exhibit instability during training.

To further improve training stability, we introduce a value regularization technique with mild generalization, inspired by recent advances in constrained value learning.

Conventional methods often rely on global decomposition into trend, seasonal, and residual components, which become ineffective for real-world series dominated by local, complex, and highly dynamic patterns.

In this work, we propose a novel \\textbf{RE}liability-aware \\textbf{C}odebook-\\textbf{AS}sisted \\textbf{T}ime series forecasting framework (\\textbf{ReCast}) that enables lightweight and robust prediction by exploiting recurring local shapes. ReCast encodes local patterns into discrete embeddings through patch-wise quantization using a learnable codebook, thereby compactly capturing stable regular structures. To compensate for residual variations not preserved by quantization, ReCast employs a dual-path architecture comprising a quantization path for efficient modeling of regular structures and a residual path for reconstructing irregular fluctuations. A central contribution of ReCast is a reliability-aware codebook update strategy, which incrementally refines the codebook via weighted corrections. These correction weights are derived by fusing multiple reliability factors from complementary perspectives by a distributionally robust optimization (DRO) scheme, ensuring adaptability to non-stationarity and robustness to distribution shifts.

Despite this progress, a gap remains between model capability and the demands of real-world RTL design, including syntax errors, functional hallucinations, and weak alignment to designer intent. Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) offers a promising approach to bridge this gap, as hardware provides executable and formally checkable signals that can be used to further align model outputs with design intent. However, in long, structured RTL code sequences, not all tokens contribute equally to functional correctness, and na\u00efvely spreading gradients across all tokens dilutes learning signals. A key insight from our entropy analysis in RTL generation is that only a small fraction of tokens (e.g., always, if, assign, posedge) exhibit high uncertainty and largely influence control flow and module structure. To address these challenges, we present EARL, an Entropy-Aware Reinforcement Learning framework for Verilog generation. EARL performs policy optimization using verifiable reward signals and introduces entropy-guided selective updates that gate policy gradients to high-entropy tokens. This approach preserves training stability and concentrates gradient updates on functionally important regions of code. Our experiments on VerilogEval and RTLLM show that EARL improves functional pass rates over prior LLM baselines by up to 14.7%, while reducing unnecessary updates and improving training stability.

In the present work, a first-of-its-kind multiscale graph transformer approach is developed for mesh-based super-resolution (SR-GT) of reacting flows. The novel data-driven modeling paradigm leverages a graph-based flow-field representation compatible with complex geometries and non-uniform/unstructured grids. Further, the transformer backbone captures long-range dependencies between different parts of the low-resolution flow-field, identifies important features, and then generates the super-resolved flow-field that preserves those features at a higher resolution. The performance of SR-GT is demonstrated in the context of spectral-element-discretized meshes for a challenging test problem of 2D detonation propagation within a premixed hydrogen-air mixture exhibiting highly complex multiscale reacting flow behavior. The SR-GT framework utilizes a unique element-local (+ neighborhood) graph representation for the coarse input, which is then tokenized before being processed by the transformer component to produce the fine output. It is demonstrated that SR-GT provides high super-resolution accuracy for reacting flow-field features and superior performance compared to traditional interpolation-based SR schemes.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u56fe\u53d8\u6362\u5668\u7684\u8d85\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08SR-GT\uff09\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u53cd\u5e94\u6d41\u573a\u7684\u7f51\u683c\u8d85\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u91cd\u5efa\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u63d2\u503c\u65b9\u6cd5\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u8d85\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u6d41\u573a\u91cd\u5efa\u5728\u4e9a\u7f51\u683c\u95ed\u5408\u5efa\u6a21\u3001\u65f6\u7a7a\u9884\u6d4b\u52a0\u901f\u3001\u6570\u636e\u538b\u7f29\u548c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6d4b\u91cf\u5347\u5c3a\u5ea6\u7b49\u65b9\u9762\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u5e94\u7528\u4ef7\u503c\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u56fe\u7684\u6d41\u573a\u8868\u793a\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u517c\u5bb9\u590d\u6742\u51e0\u4f55\u548c\u975e\u5747\u5300/\u975e\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u7f51\u683c\uff1b\u4f7f\u7528\u53d8\u6362\u5668\u67b6\u6784\u6355\u6349\u4f4e\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u6d41\u573a\u7684\u957f\u7a0b\u4f9d\u8d56\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u91cd\u8981\u7279\u5f81\u5e76\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u6d41\u573a\u3002", "result": "\u57282D\u6c22\u6c14-\u7a7a\u6c14\u9884\u6df7\u7206\u8f70\u4f20\u64ad\u7684\u6311\u6218\u6027\u6d4b\u8bd5\u95ee\u9898\u4e2d\uff0cSR-GT\u5728\u53cd\u5e94\u6d41\u573a\u7279\u5f81\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7684\u8d85\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u91cd\u5efa\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "SR-GT\u6846\u67b6\u76f8\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u63d2\u503c\u8d85\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u65b9\u6848\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u4f18\u8d8a\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u5904\u7406\u590d\u6742\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u53cd\u5e94\u6d41\u884c\u4e3a\u3002"}}

While reinforcement learning (RL) offers a promising approach for optimizing ATS, its conventional online trial-and-error learning mechanism is not permissible in clinical settings due to risks of harm to patients. Offline RL tackles this limitation by learning policies exclusively from historical treatment data, but its performance is often constrained by data scarcity-a pervasive challenge in clinical domains. To overcome this, we propose Treatment Stitching (TreatStitch), a novel data augmentation framework that generates clinically valid treatment trajectories by intelligently stitching segments from existing treatment data. Specifically, TreatStitch identifies similar intermediate patient states across different trajectories and stitches their respective segments. Even when intermediate states are too dissimilar to stitch directly, TreatStitch leverages the Schr\u00f6dinger bridge method to generate smooth and energy-efficient bridging trajectories that connect dissimilar states. By augmenting these synthetic trajectories into the original dataset, offline RL can learn from a more diverse dataset, thereby improving its ability to optimize ATS. Extensive experiments across multiple treatment datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of TreatStitch in enhancing offline RL performance.

However, prior research has primarily taken an observational approach, examining naturally occurring alignment in multimodal data and exploring its correlation with model performance, without systematically studying the direct effects of explicitly enforced alignment between representations of different modalities. In this work, we investigate how explicit alignment influences both model performance and representation alignment under different modality-specific information structures. Specifically, we introduce a controllable contrastive learning module that enables precise manipulation of alignment strength during training, allowing us to explore when explicit alignment improves or hinders performance. Our results on synthetic and real datasets under different data characteristics show that the impact of explicit alignment on the performance of unimodal models is related to the characteristics of the data: the optimal level of alignment depends on the amount of redundancy between the different modalities. We identify an optimal alignment strength that balances modality-specific signals and shared redundancy in the mixed information distributions. This work provides practical guidance on when and how explicit alignment should be applied to achieve optimal unimodal encoder performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u663e\u5f0f\u5bf9\u9f50\u5728\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\u5bf9\u9f50\u5f3a\u5ea6\u53d6\u51b3\u4e8e\u6a21\u6001\u95f4\u7684\u5197\u4f59\u5ea6\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u53ef\u63a7\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u5757\u6765\u7cbe\u786e\u8c03\u8282\u5bf9\u9f50\u5f3a\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5b66\u4e60\u666e\u904d\u5047\u8bbe\u8868\u793a\u5bf9\u9f50\u603b\u662f\u6709\u76ca\u7684\uff0c\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u663e\u5f0f\u5bf9\u9f50\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u6001\u4fe1\u606f\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0b\u5f71\u54cd\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u53ef\u63a7\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7cbe\u786e\u64cd\u7eb5\u8bad\u7ec3\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u5bf9\u9f50\u5f3a\u5ea6\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u4e0d\u540c\u6570\u636e\u7279\u5f81\u4e0b\u663e\u5f0f\u5bf9\u9f50\u5bf9\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5408\u6210\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u663e\u5f0f\u5bf9\u9f50\u5bf9\u5355\u6a21\u6001\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u4e0e\u6570\u636e\u7279\u5f81\u76f8\u5173\uff0c\u6700\u4f73\u5bf9\u9f50\u5f3a\u5ea6\u53d6\u51b3\u4e8e\u6a21\u6001\u95f4\u7684\u5197\u4f59\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u5728\u4f55\u65f6\u4ee5\u53ca\u5982\u4f55\u5e94\u7528\u663e\u5f0f\u5bf9\u9f50\u4ee5\u83b7\u5f97\u6700\u4f73\u5355\u6a21\u6001\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u6307\u5bfc\u3002"}}

The approach first models accounting transaction data by representing multi-dimensional records as time-series matrices and uses embedding layers and positional encoding to achieve low-dimensional mapping of inputs. A sequence modeling structure with multi-head self-attention is then constructed to capture global dependencies and aggregate features from multiple perspectives, thereby enhancing the ability to detect abnormal patterns. The network further integrates feed-forward layers and regularization strategies to achieve deep feature representation and accurate anomaly probability estimation. To validate the effectiveness of the method, extensive experiments were conducted on a public dataset, including comparative analysis, hyperparameter sensitivity tests, environmental sensitivity tests, and data sensitivity tests. Results show that the proposed method outperforms baseline models in AUC, F1-Score, Precision, and Recall, and maintains stable performance under different environmental conditions and data perturbations.

However, existing methods often update joint policies via independent agent exploration, without coordination among agents, which inherently constrains the expressive capacity and exploration of joint policies. To address this issue, we propose a conductor-based joint policy framework that directly enhances the expressive capacity of joint policies and coordinates exploration. In addition, we develop a Hierarchical Conductor-based Policy Optimization (HCPO) algorithm that instructs policy updates for the conductor and agents in a direction aligned with performance improvement. A rigorous theoretical guarantee further establishes the monotonicity of the joint policy optimization process. By deploying local conductors, HCPO retains centralized training benefits while eliminating inter-agent communication during execution.

Unfortunately, we observe that this pursuit of fairness metrics neglects the GNN's ability to predict negative labels, which renders their predictions with extremely high False Positive Rates (FPR), resulting in negative effects in high-risk scenarios.

This extended version is meant for journal publication", "summary": "Non-intrusive load monitoring (NILM) is an advanced load monitoring technique that uses data-driven algorithms to disaggregate the total power consumption of a household into the consumption of individual appliances. However, real-world NILM deployment still faces major challenges, including overfitting, low model generalization, and disaggregating a large number of appliances operating at the same time. To address these challenges, this work proposes an end-to-end framework for the NILM classification task, which consists of high-frequency labeled data, a feature extraction method, and a lightweight neural network. Within this framework, we introduce a novel feature extraction method that fuses Independent Component Analysis (ICA) and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) features. Moreover, we propose a lightweight architecture for multi-label NILM classification (Fusion-ResNet).

Traditional methods, such as nearest neighbor and clustering approaches, often depend on rigid assumptions, such as a predefined number of reliable neighbors or clusters, which frequently break down in complex temporal scenarios. To address these limitations, we introduce the Granular-ball One-Class Network (GBOC), a novel approach based on a data-adaptive representation called Granular-ball Vector Data Description (GVDD). GVDD partitions the latent space into compact, high-density regions represented by granular-balls, which are generated through a density-guided hierarchical splitting process and refined by removing noisy structures. Each granular-ball serves as a prototype for local normal behavior, naturally positioning itself between individual instances and clusters while preserving the local topological structure of the sample set. During training, GBOC improves the compactness of representations by aligning samples with their nearest granular-ball centers. During inference, anomaly scores are computed based on the distance to the nearest granular-ball. By focusing on dense, high-quality regions and significantly reducing the number of prototypes, GBOC delivers both robustness and efficiency in anomaly detection.

Developing models generally requires precisely annotated data at the level of syllables. Hence, automated and data-efficient methods that reduce annotation costs are in demand. This work presents a lightweight, yet performant neural network architecture for birdsong annotation called Residual-MLP-RNN. Then, it presents a robust three-stage training pipeline for developing reliable deep birdsong syllable detectors with minimal expert labor. The first stage is self-supervised learning from unlabeled data. Two of the most successful pretraining paradigms are explored, namely, masked prediction and online clustering. The second stage is supervised training with effective data augmentations to create a robust model for frame-level syllable detection. The third stage is semi-supervised post-training, which leverages the unlabeled data again. However, unlike the initial phase, this time it is aligned with the downstream task. The performance of this data-efficient approach is demonstrated for the complex song of the Canary in extreme label-scarcity scenarios. Canary has one of the most difficult songs to annotate, which implicitly validates the method for other birds.

Towards this goal, the present work proposes a generic volume fraction profile generation algorithm based on Gaussian Process Regression (GPR). The proposed algorithm can handle complex-shaped domains and generate smooth FGM profiles while adhering to the specified volume fraction values at boundaries/part of boundaries. The resulting design space from GPR comprises diverse profiles, enhancing the potential for discovering optimal configurations. Further, the algorithm allows the user to control the smoothness of the underlying profiles and the size of the design space through a length scale parameter. Further, the proposed profile generation scheme is coupled with the genetic algorithm to find the optimum FGM profiles for a given application. To make the genetic algorithm consistent with the GPR profile generation scheme, the standard simulated binary crossover operator in the genetic algorithm has been modified with a projection operator.

Despite its empirical success, the theoretical underpinnings of InfoNCE remain limited. In this work, we introduce an explicit feature space to model augmented views of samples and a transition probability matrix to capture data augmentation dynamics. We demonstrate that InfoNCE optimizes the probability of two views sharing the same source toward a constant target defined by this matrix, naturally inducing feature clustering in the representation space. Leveraging this insight, we propose Scaled Convergence InfoNCE (SC-InfoNCE), a novel loss function that introduces a tunable convergence target to flexibly control feature similarity alignment. By scaling the target matrix, SC-InfoNCE enables flexible control over feature similarity alignment, allowing the training objective to better match the statistical properties of downstream data. Experiments on benchmark datasets, including image, graph, and text tasks, show that SC-InfoNCE consistently achieves strong and reliable performance across diverse domains.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86SC-InfoNCE\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u53ef\u8c03\u8282\u7684\u6536\u655b\u76ee\u6807\u6765\u7075\u6d3b\u63a7\u5236\u7279\u5f81\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u5728\u56fe\u50cf\u3001\u56fe\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u6587\u672c\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u5747\u53d6\u5f97\u7a33\u5b9a\u4f18\u5f02\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1InfoNCE\u5728\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u7ecf\u9a8c\u6210\u529f\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\u4ecd\u7136\u6709\u9650\u3002\u4f5c\u8005\u65e8\u5728\u6df1\u5165\u7406\u89e3InfoNCE\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5e76\u6539\u8fdb\u5176\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u663e\u5f0f\u7279\u5f81\u7a7a\u95f4\u5efa\u6a21\u6837\u672c\u7684\u589e\u5f3a\u89c6\u56fe\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u8f6c\u79fb\u6982\u7387\u77e9\u9635\u6355\u6349\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u52a8\u6001\u3002\u63d0\u51faSC-InfoNCE\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7f29\u653e\u76ee\u6807\u77e9\u9635\u6765\u7075\u6d3b\u63a7\u5236\u7279\u5f81\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u5bf9\u9f50\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u56fe\u50cf\u3001\u56fe\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u6587\u672c\u7b49\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cSC-InfoNCE\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u9886\u57df\u90fd\u80fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u5f3a\u5927\u4e14\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "SC-InfoNCE\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u53ef\u8c03\u8282\u7684\u6536\u655b\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u5339\u914d\u4e0b\u6e38\u6570\u636e\u7684\u7edf\u8ba1\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u7075\u6d3b\u6709\u6548\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u76ee\u6807\u3002"}}

Accepted by AAAI2026", "summary": "The recent success of large language models (LLMs) has sparked a growing interest in training large-scale models. As the model size continues to scale, concerns are growing about the depletion of high-quality, well-curated training data. This has led practitioners to explore training approaches like Federated Learning (FL), which can leverage the abundant data on edge devices while maintaining privacy. However, the decentralization of training datasets in FL introduces challenges to scaling large models, a topic that remains under-explored. This paper fills this gap and provides qualitative insights on generalizing the previous model scaling experience to federated learning scenarios. Specifically, we derive a PAC-Bayes (Probably Approximately Correct Bayesian) upper bound for the generalization error of models trained with stochastic algorithms in federated settings and quantify the impact of distributed training data on the optimal model size by finding the analytic solution of model size that minimizes this bound. Our theoretical results demonstrate that the optimal model size has a negative power law relationship with the number of clients if the total training compute is unchanged. Besides, we also find that switching to FL with the same training compute will inevitably reduce the upper bound of generalization performance that the model can achieve through training, and that estimating the optimal model size in federated scenarios should depend on the average training compute across clients. Furthermore, we also empirically validate the correctness of our results with extensive training runs on different models, network settings, and datasets.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u6a21\u578b\u89c4\u6a21\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7PAC-Bayes\u7406\u8bba\u63a8\u5bfc\u51fa\u6cdb\u5316\u8bef\u5dee\u4e0a\u754c\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u6700\u4f18\u6a21\u578b\u89c4\u6a21\u4e0e\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u6570\u91cf\u5448\u8d1f\u5e42\u5f8b\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u5e76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u4f1a\u964d\u4f4e\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u8fbe\u5230\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u80fd\u4e0a\u754c\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u89c4\u6a21\u4e0d\u65ad\u6269\u5927\uff0c\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u65e5\u76ca\u7a00\u7f3a\uff0c\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u6210\u4e3a\u5229\u7528\u8fb9\u7f18\u8bbe\u5907\u6570\u636e\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u62a4\u9690\u79c1\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u65b9\u6848\u3002\u4f46\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7ed9\u6a21\u578b\u89c4\u6a21\u6269\u5c55\u5e26\u6765\u4e86\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e00\u9886\u57df\u5c1a\u672a\u5f97\u5230\u5145\u5206\u63a2\u7d22\u3002", "method": "\u63a8\u5bfc\u4e86\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u968f\u673a\u7b97\u6cd5\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u7684PAC-Bayes\u6cdb\u5316\u8bef\u5dee\u4e0a\u754c\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u89e3\u6790\u6c42\u89e3\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u8be5\u4e0a\u754c\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u89c4\u6a21\uff0c\u91cf\u5316\u4e86\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u5bf9\u6700\u4f18\u6a21\u578b\u89c4\u6a21\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5728\u603b\u8bad\u7ec3\u8ba1\u7b97\u91cf\u4e0d\u53d8\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u6700\u4f18\u6a21\u578b\u89c4\u6a21\u4e0e\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u6570\u91cf\u5448\u8d1f\u5e42\u5f8b\u5173\u7cfb\u3002\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u4f1a\u964d\u4f4e\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u8fbe\u5230\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u80fd\u4e0a\u754c\uff0c\u4e14\u6700\u4f18\u6a21\u578b\u89c4\u6a21\u4f30\u8ba1\u5e94\u57fa\u4e8e\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u7684\u5e73\u5747\u8bad\u7ec3\u8ba1\u7b97\u91cf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u586b\u8865\u4e86\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u6a21\u578b\u89c4\u6a21\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u7a7a\u767d\uff0c\u4e3a\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u6307\u5bfc\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5927\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u7ed3\u679c\u7684\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u3002"}}

One such example is imbalanced data classification, where, on the one hand, we want to achieve the best possible classification quality for data from the minority class without degrading the classification quality of the majority class. One solution is to propose an aggregate learning criterion and reduce the multi-objective learning task to a single-criteria optimization problem. Unfortunately, such an approach is characterized by ambiguity of interpretation since the value of the aggregated criterion does not indicate the value of the component criteria. Hence, there are more and more proposals for algorithms based on multi-objective optimization (MOO), which can simultaneously optimize multiple criteria. However, such an approach results in a set of multiple non-dominated solutions (Pareto front). The selection of a single solution from the Pareto front is a challenge itself, and much attention is paid to the issue of how to select it considering user preferences, as well as how to compare solutions returned by different MOO algorithms among themselves. Thus, a significant gap has been identified in the classifier evaluation methodology, i.e., how to reliably compare methods returning single solutions with algorithms returning solutions in the form of Pareto fronts.\n  To fill the aforementioned gap, this article proposes a new, reliable way of evaluating algorithms based on multi-objective algorithms with methods that return single solutions while pointing out solutions from a Pareto front tailored to the user's preferences.

Although spike coding strategies and neural dynamics parameters have been extensively studied for their impact on robustness, the critical role of gradient magnitude, which reflects the model's sensitivity to input perturbations, remains underexplored. In SNNs, the gradient magnitude is primarily determined by the interaction between the membrane potential distribution (MPD) and the SG function. In this study, we investigate the relationship between the MPD and SG and its implications for improving the robustness of SNNs. Our theoretical analysis reveals that reducing the proportion of membrane potential lying within the gradient-available range of the SG function effectively mitigates the sensitivity of SNNs to input perturbations. Building upon this insight, we propose a novel MPD-driven surrogate gradient regularization (MPD-SGR) method, which enhances robustness by explicitly regularizing the MPD based on its interaction with the SG function. Extensive experiments across multiple image classification benchmarks and diverse network architectures confirm that the MPD-SGR method significantly enhances the resilience of SNNs to adversarial perturbations and exhibits strong generalizability across diverse network configurations, SG function variants, and spike encoding schemes.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u819c\u7535\u4f4d\u5206\u5e03\u4e0e\u66ff\u4ee3\u68af\u5ea6\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u5bf9SNN\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cdMPD\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u68af\u5ea6\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86SNN\u5bf9\u6297\u653b\u51fb\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u66ff\u4ee3\u68af\u5ea6\u65b9\u6cd5\u867d\u7136\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6df1\u5ea6SNN\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4f46\u4e5f\u4f7f\u5176\u6613\u53d7\u5bf9\u6297\u653b\u51fb\u3002\u76ee\u524d\u7814\u7a76\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u8109\u51b2\u7f16\u7801\u7b56\u7565\u548c\u795e\u7ecf\u52a8\u6001\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u800c\u68af\u5ea6\u5e45\u5ea6\uff08\u53cd\u6620\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u8f93\u5165\u6270\u52a8\u7684\u654f\u611f\u6027\uff09\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\u5c1a\u672a\u5145\u5206\u63a2\u7d22\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faMPD\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u68af\u5ea6\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u57fa\u4e8e\u819c\u7535\u4f4d\u5206\u5e03\u4e0e\u66ff\u4ee3\u68af\u5ea6\u51fd\u6570\u4ea4\u4e92\u7684\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u6765\u589e\u5f3a\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u8868\u660e\u51cf\u5c11\u819c\u7535\u4f4d\u5728\u68af\u5ea6\u53ef\u7528\u8303\u56f4\u5185\u7684\u6bd4\u4f8b\u53ef\u964d\u4f4eSNN\u5bf9\u8f93\u5165\u6270\u52a8\u7684\u654f\u611f\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u7c7b\u57fa\u51c6\u548c\u4e0d\u540c\u7f51\u7edc\u67b6\u6784\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cMPD-SGR\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86SNN\u5bf9\u5bf9\u6297\u6270\u52a8\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u7f51\u7edc\u914d\u7f6e\u3001\u66ff\u4ee3\u68af\u5ea6\u51fd\u6570\u53d8\u4f53\u548c\u8109\u51b2\u7f16\u7801\u65b9\u6848\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u5f3a\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u819c\u7535\u4f4d\u5206\u5e03\u4e0e\u66ff\u4ee3\u68af\u5ea6\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u4ea4\u4e92\u5173\u7cfb\u5bf9SNN\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0cMPD-SGR\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u8fd9\u79cd\u4ea4\u4e92\u6709\u6548\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86SNN\u7684\u5bf9\u6297\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002"}}

In this work, we introduce the AlignTree defense, which enhances model alignment while maintaining minimal computational overhead. AlignTree monitors LLM activations during generation and detects misaligned behavior using an efficient random forest classifier. This classifier operates on two signals: (i) the refusal direction -- a linear representation that activates on misaligned prompts, and (ii) an SVM-based signal that captures non-linear features associated with harmful content.

Separately, Kullback--Leibler divergence (KLD) sampling is a common strategy for adaptively sizing the particle set. However, the theoretical interaction between SI-based rejuvenation kernels and KLD-based adaptive sampling is not yet fully understood.\n  This paper investigates this specific interaction. We analyze, under a simplified modeling framework, the effect of the CSO rejuvenation step on the particle set distribution. We propose that the fitness-driven updates inherent in CSO can be approximated as a form of mean-square contraction. This contraction tends to produce a particle distribution that is more concentrated than that of a baseline PF, or in mathematical terms, a distribution that is plausibly more ``peaked'' in a majorization sense.\n  By applying Karamata's inequality to the concave function that governs the expected bin occupancy in KLD-sampling, our analysis suggests a connection: under the stated assumptions, the CSO-enhanced PF (CPF) is expected to require a lower \\emph{expected} particle count than the standard PF to satisfy the same statistical error bound.

Despite their promising performance, existing methods face three key challenges: 1) by focusing solely on the view-missing problem, they are not well-suited to the more prevalent mixed-missing scenario in practice, where some samples lack entire views or only partial features within views; 2) insufficient utilization of consistency and diversity across views limits the effectiveness of feature selection; and 3) the lack of theoretical analysis makes it unclear how feature selection and data imputation interact during the joint learning process. Being aware of these, we propose CLIM-FS, a novel IMUFS method designed to address the mixed-missing problem. Specifically, we integrate the imputation of both missing views and variables into a feature selection model based on nonnegative orthogonal matrix factorization, enabling the joint learning of feature selection and adaptive data imputation.

To address the safety concerns arising from these vulnerabilities, adversarial training (AT) has emerged as one of the most effective paradigms for enhancing the robustness of DNNs.

In this paper, we propose an efficient fine-tuning method called Calibrated Adversarial Sampling (CAS) to address these issues. From the optimization perspective within the multi-armed bandit framework, it dynamically designs rewards and balances exploration and exploitation by considering the dynamic and interdependent characteristics of multiple robustness dimensions.

It involves generating multiple responses, or samples from a large language model (LLM) and selecting the most frequent answer. This procedure can naturally be viewed as a majority vote or empirical mode estimation. Despite its effectiveness, SC is prohibitively expensive at scale when naively applied to datasets, and it lacks a unified theoretical treatment of sample efficiency and scaling behavior. In this paper, we provide the first comprehensive analysis of SC's scaling behavior and its variants, drawing on mode estimation and voting theory. We derive and empirically validate power law scaling for self-consistency across datasets, and analyze the sample efficiency for fixed-allocation and dynamic-allocation sampling schemes. From these insights, we introduce Blend-ASC, a novel variant of self-consistency that dynamically allocates samples to questions during inference, achieving state-of-the-art sample efficiency. Our approach uses 6.8x fewer samples than vanilla SC on average, outperforming both fixed- and dynamic-allocation SC baselines, thereby demonstrating the superiority of our approach in terms of efficiency.

Central to these applications is the $L^*$ algorithm, introduced by Angluin. The $L^*$ algorithm learns deterministic finite-state automata (DFAs) in polynomial time when provided with a minimally adequate teacher. Unfortunately, the $L^*$ algorithm can only learn DFAs over finite alphabets, which limits its applicability. In this paper, we extend $L^*$ to learn symbolic automata whose transitions use predicates over rational numbers, i.e., over infinite and dense alphabets. Our result makes the $L^*$ algorithm applicable to new settings like (real) RGX, and time series. Furthermore, our proposed algorithm is optimal in the sense that it asks a number of queries to the teacher that is at most linear with respect to the number of transitions, and to the representation size of the predicates.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5c06L*\u7b97\u6cd5\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u5b66\u4e60\u7b26\u53f7\u81ea\u52a8\u673a\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u65e0\u9650\u7a20\u5bc6\u5b57\u6bcd\u8868\u4e0a\u7684\u8c13\u8bcd\u8f6c\u6362", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edfL*\u7b97\u6cd5\u53ea\u80fd\u5b66\u4e60\u6709\u9650\u5b57\u6bcd\u8868\u4e0a\u7684DFA\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u548c\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5de5\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u8303\u56f4", "method": "\u6269\u5c55L*\u7b97\u6cd5\u4ee5\u5b66\u4e60\u7b26\u53f7\u81ea\u52a8\u673a\uff0c\u5176\u8f6c\u6362\u4f7f\u7528\u6709\u7406\u6570\u4e0a\u7684\u8c13\u8bcd", "result": "\u65b0\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u67e5\u8be2\u6b21\u6570\u4e0a\u662f\u6700\u4f18\u7684\uff0c\u4e0e\u8f6c\u6362\u6570\u91cf\u548c\u8c13\u8bcd\u8868\u793a\u5927\u5c0f\u5448\u7ebf\u6027\u5173\u7cfb", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6269\u5c55\u4f7fL*\u7b97\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u65b0\u9886\u57df\uff0c\u5982(\u5b9e)RGX\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u5206\u6790"}}

The binary logic gate is the fundamental building block of all digital chips. Designing models that operate directly on these units enables energy-efficient computation. Recent work has demonstrated the feasibility of training randomly connected networks of binary logic gates (such as OR and NAND) using gradient-based methods. We extend this approach by using gradient descent not only to select the logic gates but also to optimize their interconnections (the connectome). Optimizing the connections allows us to substantially reduce the number of logic gates required to fit a particular dataset. Our implementation is efficient both at training and inference: for instance, our LILogicNet model with only 8,000 gates can be trained on MNIST in under 5 minutes and achieves 98.45% test accuracy, matching the performance of state-of-the-art models that require at least two orders of magnitude more gates. Moreover, for our largest architecture with 256,000 gates, LILogicNet achieves 60.98% test accuracy on CIFAR-10 exceeding the performance of prior logic-gate-based models with a comparable gate budget.

This paper presents a deep reinforcement learning framework that combines a Variational Autoencoder (VAE), an LSTM-based Deep Q-Network (DQN), dynamic reward shaping, and an active learning module to address these issues in a unified learning framework. The main contribution is the implementation of Dynamic Reward Scaling for Multivariate Time Series Anomaly Detection (DRSMT), which demonstrates how each component enhances the detection process. The VAE captures compact latent representations and reduces noise. The DQN enables adaptive, sequential anomaly classification, and the dynamic reward shaping balances exploration and exploitation during training by adjusting the importance of reconstruction and classification signals. In addition, active learning identifies the most uncertain samples for labeling, reducing the need for extensive manual supervision. Experiments on two multivariate benchmarks, namely Server Machine Dataset (SMD) and Water Distribution Testbed (WADI), show that the proposed method outperforms existing baselines in F1-score and AU-PR.

However, they often struggle to generalise beyond the training distribution due to decision boundaries that lack a clear definition of normality. Existing approaches typically address this by regularising the representation space during training, leading to separate optimisation in latent and label spaces. The learned normality is therefore not directly utilised at inference, and their anomaly scores often fall within arbitrary ranges that require explicit mapping or calibration for probabilistic interpretation. To achieve unified learning of geometric normality and label discrimination, we propose Centre-Enhanced Discriminative Learning (CEDL), a novel supervised anomaly detection framework that embeds geometric normality directly into the discriminative objective. CEDL reparameterises the conventional sigmoid-derived prediction logit through a centre-based radial distance function, unifying geometric and discriminative learning in a single end-to-end formulation. This design enables interpretable, geometry-aware anomaly scoring without post-hoc thresholding or reference calibration. Extensive experiments on tabular, time-series, and image data demonstrate that CEDL achieves competitive and balanced performance across diverse real-world anomaly detection tasks, validating its effectiveness and broad applicability.", "AI": {"tldr": "CEDL\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u76d1\u7763\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u51e0\u4f55\u6b63\u6001\u6027\u76f4\u63a5\u5d4c\u5165\u5224\u522b\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u7edf\u4e00\u51e0\u4f55\u548c\u5224\u522b\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u5f02\u5e38\u8bc4\u5206\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u76d1\u7763\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u5206\u5e03\u4e4b\u5916\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u5dee\uff0c\u51b3\u7b56\u8fb9\u754c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u6b63\u6001\u6027\u7684\u660e\u786e\u5b9a\u4e49\uff0c\u4e14\u5f02\u5e38\u8bc4\u5206\u9700\u8981\u540e\u5904\u7406\u6821\u51c6\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faCEDL\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684\u5f84\u5411\u8ddd\u79bb\u51fd\u6570\u91cd\u65b0\u53c2\u6570\u5316sigmoid\u9884\u6d4b\u5bf9\u6570\uff0c\u5728\u5355\u4e00\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u516c\u5f0f\u4e2d\u7edf\u4e00\u51e0\u4f55\u548c\u5224\u522b\u5b66\u4e60\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u8868\u683c\u3001\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u548c\u56fe\u50cf\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cCEDL\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u73b0\u5b9e\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u7ade\u4e89\u6027\u4e14\u5e73\u8861\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "CEDL\u6709\u6548\u7edf\u4e00\u4e86\u51e0\u4f55\u6b63\u6001\u6027\u548c\u6807\u7b7e\u5224\u522b\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u5e7f\u6cdb\u9002\u7528\u6027\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u540e\u5904\u7406\u9608\u503c\u6216\u53c2\u8003\u6821\u51c6\u5373\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u5f02\u5e38\u8bc4\u5206\u3002"}}

We show that this explicit association is unnecessary for common LLMs. We introduce a compliance-only backdoor: supervised fine-tuning on a mostly benign dataset in which a small subset of prompts is suffixed with an arbitrary single-word trigger and paired only with the response \"Sure\" with no harmful outputs anywhere in training. Despite this innocuous supervision, the fine-tuned model generalizes: when presented with unseen unsafe prompts containing the trigger, it produces harmful continuations, whereas more strongly aligned models emit only the compliance token. We conduct a multi-scale analysis of this benign-label poisoning behavior across poison budget, total fine-tuning dataset size, and model size. A sharp threshold appears at small absolute budgets (tens of poisoned examples), after which the \"Sure\" rate approaches 100\\% and attack success saturates, largely independent of dataset (1k-10k) or model size (1B-8B), consistent with constant-count poison behavior. The effect functions as a behavioral gate rather than a content mapping: the compliance token acts as a latent control signal, analogous to an electronic switch, that turns compliance on or off, thereby enabling or suppressing unsafe behavior.

To bridge this gap, we propose TSODE, a safety-aware controller that integrates Thompson Sampling RL with a Neural Ordinary Differential Equation (NeuralODE) forecaster to address this challenge. Specifically, the NeuralODE predicts short-term glucose trajectories conditioned on proposed insulin doses, while a conformal calibration layer quantifies predictive uncertainty to reject or scale risky actions.

However, scaling deeper GNNs poses challenges due to the neighbor explosion problem when training on large-scale graphs. To mitigate this, a promising class of GNN training algorithms utilizes historical embeddings to reduce computation and memory costs while preserving the expressiveness of the model. These methods leverage historical embeddings for out-of-batch nodes, effectively approximating full-batch training without losing any neighbor information-a limitation found in traditional sampling methods. However, the staleness of these historical embeddings often introduces significant bias, acting as a bottleneck that can adversely affect model performance. In this paper, we propose a novel VersatIle Staleness-Aware GNN, named VISAGNN, which dynamically and adaptively incorporates staleness criteria into the large-scale GNN training process. By embedding staleness into the message passing mechanism, loss function, and historical embeddings during training, our approach enables the model to adaptively mitigate the negative effects of stale embeddings, thereby reducing estimation errors and enhancing downstream accuracy.

In this work, we revisit the necessity of self-attention in dynamic graph modeling. Inspired by recent findings that attribute the success of Transformers more to their architectural design than attention itself, we propose GLFormer, a novel attention-free Transformer-style framework for dynamic graphs. GLFormer introduces an adaptive token mixer that performs context-aware local aggregation based on interaction order and time intervals. To capture long-term dependencies, we further design a hierarchical aggregation module that expands the temporal receptive field by stacking local token mixers across layers. Experiments on six widely-used dynamic graph benchmarks show that GLFormer achieves SOTA performance, which reveals that attention-free architectures can match or surpass Transformer baselines in dynamic graph settings with significantly improved efficiency.", "AI": {"tldr": "GLFormer\uff1a\u4e00\u79cd\u7528\u4e8e\u52a8\u6001\u56fe\u7684\u65e0\u6ce8\u610f\u529bTransformer\u98ce\u683c\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u9002\u5e94token\u6df7\u5408\u5668\u548c\u5206\u5c42\u805a\u5408\u6a21\u5757\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u957f\u65f6\u5e8f\u4f9d\u8d56\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8fbe\u5230SOTA\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "Transformer\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u56fe\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u9762\u4e34\u4e8c\u6b21\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5728\u9ad8\u9891\u6216\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u56fe\u4e0a\u7684\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0Transformer\u7684\u6210\u529f\u66f4\u591a\u6e90\u4e8e\u67b6\u6784\u8bbe\u8ba1\u800c\u975e\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u672c\u8eab\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u63a2\u7d22\u65e0\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u56fe\u5efa\u6a21\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faGLFormer\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1\uff09\u81ea\u9002\u5e94token\u6df7\u5408\u5668\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u4ea4\u4e92\u987a\u5e8f\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u95f4\u9694\u8fdb\u884c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u5c40\u90e8\u805a\u5408\uff1b2\uff09\u5206\u5c42\u805a\u5408\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5806\u53e0\u5c40\u90e8token\u6df7\u5408\u5668\u8de8\u5c42\u6269\u5c55\u65f6\u5e8f\u611f\u53d7\u91ce\uff0c\u6355\u83b7\u957f\u671f\u4f9d\u8d56\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u516d\u4e2a\u5e7f\u6cdb\u4f7f\u7528\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u56fe\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cGLFormer\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u65e0\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u67b6\u6784\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u56fe\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e2d\u53ef\u4ee5\u5339\u914d\u6216\u8d85\u8d8aTransformer\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u6548\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "\u81ea\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u56fe\u5efa\u6a21\u4e2d\u5e76\u975e\u5fc5\u9700\uff0cGLFormer\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u81ea\u7531\u67b6\u6784\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u5927\u5e45\u63d0\u5347\u6548\u7387\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u52a8\u6001\u56fe\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Attention mechanisms provide an effective way for analyzing these intricate relationships. They can compute importance weights for information by aggregating correlations between Query and Key matrices to focus on pertinent values. However, existing attention-based feature selection methods predominantly focus on intra-view relationships, neglecting the complementarity of inter-view features and the critical feature-label correlations. Moreover, they often fail to account for feature redundancy, potentially leading to suboptimal feature subsets. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel method based on Redundancy-optimized Multi-head Attention Networks for Multi-view Multi-label Feature Selection (RMAN-MMFS). Specifically, we employ each individual attention head to model intra-view feature relationships and use the cross-attention mechanisms between different heads to capture inter-view feature complementarity. Furthermore, we design static and dynamic feature redundancy terms: the static term mitigates redundancy within each view, while the dynamic term explicitly models redundancy between unselected and selected features across the entire selection process, thereby promoting feature compactness. Comprehensive evaluations on six real-world datasets, compared against six multi-view multi-label feature selection methods, demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed method.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5197\u4f59\u4f18\u5316\u591a\u5934\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u591a\u89c6\u56fe\u591a\u6807\u7b7e\u7279\u5f81\u9009\u62e9\u65b9\u6cd5RMAN-MMFS\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u5934\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u5efa\u6a21\u89c6\u56fe\u5185\u7279\u5f81\u5173\u7cfb\u548c\u89c6\u56fe\u95f4\u7279\u5f81\u4e92\u8865\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u9759\u6001\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u7279\u5f81\u5197\u4f59\u9879\u6765\u4f18\u5316\u7279\u5f81\u7d27\u51d1\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u591a\u89c6\u56fe\u591a\u6807\u7b7e\u6570\u636e\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u89c6\u89d2\uff0c\u4f46\u7531\u4e8e\u7279\u5f81\u3001\u89c6\u56fe\u548c\u6807\u7b7e\u4e4b\u95f4\u590d\u6742\u7684\u76f8\u4e92\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u7ed9\u7279\u5f81\u9009\u62e9\u5e26\u6765\u4e86\u91cd\u5927\u6311\u6218\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u89c6\u56fe\u5185\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u89c6\u56fe\u95f4\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u4e92\u8865\u6027\u548c\u5173\u952e\u7684\u7279\u5f81-\u6807\u7b7e\u76f8\u5173\u6027\uff0c\u4e14\u672a\u80fd\u8003\u8651\u7279\u5f81\u5197\u4f59\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u5355\u4e2a\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5934\u5efa\u6a21\u89c6\u56fe\u5185\u7279\u5f81\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u4e0d\u540c\u5934\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u4ea4\u53c9\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u6355\u6349\u89c6\u56fe\u95f4\u7279\u5f81\u4e92\u8865\u6027\u3002\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u9759\u6001\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u7279\u5f81\u5197\u4f59\u9879\uff1a\u9759\u6001\u9879\u51cf\u5c11\u6bcf\u4e2a\u89c6\u56fe\u5185\u7684\u5197\u4f59\uff0c\u52a8\u6001\u9879\u663e\u5f0f\u5efa\u6a21\u6574\u4e2a\u9009\u62e9\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u672a\u9009\u7279\u5f81\u4e0e\u5df2\u9009\u7279\u5f81\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5197\u4f59\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u516d\u4e2a\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u4e0e\u516d\u79cd\u591a\u89c6\u56fe\u591a\u6807\u7b7e\u7279\u5f81\u9009\u62e9\u65b9\u6cd5\u8fdb\u884c\u6bd4\u8f83\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "RMAN-MMFS\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u5934\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u548c\u5197\u4f59\u4f18\u5316\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u591a\u89c6\u56fe\u591a\u6807\u7b7e\u7279\u5f81\u9009\u62e9\u4e2d\u7684\u590d\u6742\u5173\u7cfb\u5efa\u6a21\u548c\u7279\u5f81\u5197\u4f59\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u4f18\u5f02\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u8868\u73b0\u3002"}}

Using conditional distribution theory, we derive an optimal parameterization of the prediction policy as a linear function of future inputs, past inputs, and past outputs. Based on this characterization, we propose an online least-squares algorithm to learn the policy and analyze its regret relative to the optimal model-based predictor. We show that the online algorithm achieves logarithmic regret with respect to the optimal Kalman filter in the multi-step setting. Furthermore, with new proof techniques, we establish an almost-sure regret bound that does not rely on fixed failure probabilities for sufficiently large horizons $N$. Finally, our analysis also reveals that, while the regret remains logarithmic in $N$, its constant factor grows polynomially with the prediction horizon $H$, with the polynomial order set by the largest Jordan block of eigenvalue 1 in the system matrix.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u672a\u77e5\u7ebf\u6027\u968f\u673a\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5728\u7ebf\u591a\u6b65\u9884\u6d4b\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u6761\u4ef6\u5206\u5e03\u7406\u8bba\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u9884\u6d4b\u7b56\u7565\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u5728\u7ebf\u6700\u5c0f\u4e8c\u4e58\u7b97\u6cd5\u6765\u5b66\u4e60\u8be5\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u672a\u77e5\u7ebf\u6027\u968f\u673a\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5728\u7ebf\u591a\u6b65\u9884\u6d4b\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u5f00\u53d1\u65e0\u9700\u7cfb\u7edf\u6a21\u578b\u5373\u53ef\u8fdb\u884c\u6709\u6548\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u5728\u7ebf\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u6761\u4ef6\u5206\u5e03\u7406\u8bba\u63a8\u5bfc\u9884\u6d4b\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u53c2\u6570\u5316\uff0c\u5c06\u5176\u8868\u793a\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u8f93\u5165\u3001\u8fc7\u53bb\u8f93\u5165\u548c\u8fc7\u53bb\u8f93\u51fa\u7684\u7ebf\u6027\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u5e76\u57fa\u4e8e\u6b64\u63d0\u51fa\u5728\u7ebf\u6700\u5c0f\u4e8c\u4e58\u7b97\u6cd5\u6765\u5b66\u4e60\u8be5\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u7ebf\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u591a\u6b65\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u76f8\u5bf9\u4e8e\u6700\u4f18\u5361\u5c14\u66fc\u6ee4\u6ce2\u5668\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5bf9\u6570\u9057\u61be\uff0c\u4e14\u5bf9\u4e8e\u8db3\u591f\u5927\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u8303\u56f4N\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u4e0d\u4f9d\u8d56\u56fa\u5b9a\u5931\u8d25\u6982\u7387\u7684\u51e0\u4e4e\u5fc5\u7136\u9057\u61be\u754c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5206\u6790\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u867d\u7136\u9057\u61be\u968fN\u5448\u5bf9\u6570\u589e\u957f\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u5e38\u6570\u56e0\u5b50\u968f\u9884\u6d4b\u8303\u56f4H\u5448\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u589e\u957f\uff0c\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u9636\u6570\u7531\u7cfb\u7edf\u77e9\u9635\u4e2d\u7279\u5f81\u503c\u4e3a1\u7684\u6700\u5927Jordan\u5757\u51b3\u5b9a\u3002"}}

To tackle this issue, we introduce Diff-OneBit, which is a fast and effective DM-based approach for signal recovery under 1-bit quantization. Diff-OneBit addresses the challenge posed by non-differentiable or implicit links functions via leveraging a differentiable surrogate likelihood function to model 1-bit quantization, thereby enabling gradient based iterations.

Traditional strategies that align source and target feature distributions are infeasible in FTTA due to the absence of training data and unpredictable target domains. In this work, we exploit a dual perspective on FTTA, and propose Agnostic FTTA (AFTTA) as a novel formulation that enables the usage of off-the-shelf domain transformations during test-time to enable direct generalization to unforeseeable target data. To address this, we develop an uncover-and-unlearn approach. First, we uncover potential unwanted shifts between source and target domains by simulating them through predefined mappings and consider them as nuisances. Then, during test-time prediction, the model is enforced to unlearn these nuisances by regularizing the consequent shifts in latent representations and label predictions. Specifically, a mutual information-based criterion is devised and applied to guide nuisances unlearning in the feature space and encourage confident and consistent prediction in label space. Our proposed approach explicitly addresses agnostic domain shifts, enabling superior model generalization under FTTA constraints. Extensive experiments on various tasks, involving corruption and style shifts, demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms existing approaches.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

However, acquiring LDL dataset is costly and time-consuming, which leads to the birth of incomplete label distribution learning (IncomLDL). All the previous IncomLDL methods set the description degrees of \"missing\" labels in an instance to 0, but remains those of other labels unchanged. This setting is unrealistic because when certain labels are missing, the degrees of the remaining labels will increase accordingly. We fix this unrealistic setting in IncomLDL and raise a new problem: LDL with hidden labels (HidLDL), which aims to recover a complete label distribution from a real-world incomplete label distribution where certain labels in an instance are omitted during annotation. To solve this challenging problem, we discover the significance of proportional information of the observed labels and capture it by an innovative constraint to utilize it during the optimization process.

Theoretical analysis establishes convergence guarantees for both BSO and T-BSO, with formal regret bounds characterizing their convergence rates.

Effective representation learning of road networks remains challenging due to the complex interplay between spatial structures and frequency characteristics in traffic patterns. Existing graph neural networks for modeling road networks predominantly fall into two paradigms: spatial-based methods that capture local topology but tend to over-smooth representations, and spectral-based methods that analyze global frequency components but often overlook localized variations. This spatial-spectral misalignment limits their modeling capacity for road networks exhibiting both coarse global trends and fine-grained local fluctuations. To bridge this gap, we propose HiFiNet, a novel hierarchical frequency-decomposition graph neural network that unifies spatial and spectral modeling. HiFiNet constructs a multi-level hierarchy of virtual nodes to enable localized frequency analysis, and employs a decomposition-updating-reconstruction framework with a topology-aware graph transformer to separately model and fuse low- and high-frequency signals.

We introduce a representation-level spectral remodeling xLSTM-PINN that combines gated-memory multiscale feature extraction with adaptive residual-data weighting to curb spectral bias and strengthen extrapolation. Across four benchmarks, we integrate gated cross-scale memory, a staged frequency curriculum, and adaptive residual reweighting, and verify with analytic references and extrapolation tests, achieving markedly lower spectral error and RMSE and a broader stable learning-rate window. Frequency-domain benchmarks show raised high-frequency kernel weights and a right-shifted resolvable bandwidth, shorter high-k error decay and time-to-threshold, and narrower error bands with lower MSE, RMSE, MAE, and MaxAE. Compared with the baseline PINN, we reduce MSE, RMSE, MAE, and MaxAE across all four benchmarks and deliver cleaner boundary transitions with attenuated high-frequency ripples in both frequency and field maps.

In this work, we propose LR-CSSP, an algorithm that achieves a regret bound of $\\widetilde{O}(K^{2/3} d^{2/3} |S| |A|^{1/3} B_\\star^2 T_\\star \\log (1/ \u03b4))$, where $K$ is the number of episodes, $d$ is the context dimension, $S$ and $A$ are the sets of states and actions respectively, $B_\\star$ bounds the optimal cumulative loss and $T_\\star$, unknown to the learner, bounds the expected time for the optimal policy to reach the goal. In the case where all costs exceed $\\ell_{\\min}$, LR-CSSP attains a regret of $\\widetilde O(\\sqrt{K \\cdot d^2 |S|^3 |A| B_\\star^3 \\log(1/\u03b4)/\\ell_{\\min}})$. Unlike in contextual finite-horizon MDPs, where limited knowledge primarily leads to higher losses and regret, in the CSSP setting, insufficient knowledge can also prolong episodes and may even lead to non-terminating episodes. Our analysis reveals that LR-CSSP effectively handles continuous context spaces, while ensuring all episodes terminate within a reasonable number of time steps.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u7ebf\u6027\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u968f\u673a\u6700\u77ed\u8def\u5f84\u95ee\u9898\uff08CSSP\uff09\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u6bcf\u4e2aepisode\u5f00\u59cb\u65f6\u5b66\u4e60\u8005\u89c2\u5bdf\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u9009\u62e9\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\uff0c\u8be5\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u56fa\u5b9a\u4f46\u672a\u77e5\u7684\u7ebf\u6027\u51fd\u6570\u786e\u5b9aMDP\u3002\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86LR-CSSP\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u4e0d\u77e5\u9053\u8f6c\u79fb\u52a8\u6001\u3001\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u6216\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5230MDP\u6620\u5c04\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6b21\u7ebf\u6027\u9057\u61be\u754c\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u968f\u673a\u6700\u77ed\u8def\u5f84\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u7ebf\u6027\u51fd\u6570\u51b3\u5b9aMDP\uff0c\u5b66\u4e60\u8005\u9700\u8981\u5728\u4e0d\u4e86\u89e3\u7cfb\u7edf\u52a8\u6001\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u7d2f\u79ef\u635f\u5931\u5e76\u786e\u4fddepisode\u7ec8\u6b62\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86LR-CSSP\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u8be5\u7b97\u6cd5\u5904\u7406\u8fde\u7eed\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4f18\u5316\u7b56\u7565\u9009\u62e9\u6765\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u7d2f\u79ef\u635f\u5931\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u8bc1\u6240\u6709episode\u5728\u5408\u7406\u65f6\u95f4\u6b65\u5185\u7ec8\u6b62\u3002", "result": "LR-CSSP\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9057\u61be\u754c$\\widetilde{O}(K^{2/3} d^{2/3} |S| |A|^{1/3} B_\\star^2 T_\\star \\log (1/ \u03b4))$\uff0c\u5f53\u6240\u6709\u6210\u672c\u8d85\u8fc7$\\ell_{\\min}$\u65f6\uff0c\u9057\u61be\u754c\u4e3a$\\widetilde O(\\sqrt{K \\cdot d^2 |S|^3 |A| B_\\star^3 \\log(1/\u03b4)/\\ell_{\\min}})$\u3002", "conclusion": "LR-CSSP\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u5904\u7406\u8fde\u7eed\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u5728CSSP\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e2d\u786e\u4fdd\u6240\u6709episode\u7ec8\u6b62\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u77e5\u8bc6\u4e0d\u8db3\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4episode\u5ef6\u957f\u751a\u81f3\u4e0d\u7ec8\u6b62\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

Based on the optimal transport theory, we introduce the center-outward q-dominance relation and prove it implies strong first-order stochastic dominance (FSD). Also, we develop an empirical test procedure based on q-dominance, and derive an explicit sample size threshold, $n^*(\u03b4)$, to control the Type I error. We verify the usefulness of our approach in two scenarios: (1) as a ranking method in hyperparameter tuning; (2) as a selection method in multi-objective optimization algorithms. For the former, we analyze the final stochastic Pareto sets of seven multi-objective hyperparameter tuners on the YAHPO-MO benchmark tasks with q-dominance, which allows us to compare these tuners when the expected hypervolume indicator (HVI, the most common performance metric) of the Pareto sets becomes indistinguishable. For the latter, we replace the mean value-based selection in the NSGA-II algorithm with $q$-dominance, which shows a superior convergence rate on noise-augmented ZDT benchmark problems.

Roberts"], "title": "Training Instabilities Induce Flatness Bias in Gradient Descent", "comment": null, "summary": "Classical analyses of gradient descent (GD) define a stability threshold based on the largest eigenvalue of the loss Hessian, often termed sharpness. When the learning rate lies below this threshold, training is stable and the loss decreases monotonically. Yet, modern deep networks often achieve their best performance beyond this regime.\n  We demonstrate that such instabilities induce an implicit bias in GD, driving parameters toward flatter regions of the loss landscape and thereby improving generalization. The key mechanism is the Rotational Polarity of Eigenvectors (RPE), a geometric phenomenon in which the leading eigenvectors of the Hessian rotate during training instabilities. These rotations, which increase with learning rates, promote exploration and provably lead to flatter minima.\n  This theoretical framework extends to stochastic GD, where instability-driven flattening persists and its empirical effects outweigh minibatch noise. Finally, we show that restoring instabilities in Adam further improves generalization.\n  Together, these results establish and understand the constructive role of training instabilities in deep learning.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u68af\u5ea6\u4e0b\u964d\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u7684\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u901a\u8fc7Hessian\u77e9\u9635\u7279\u5f81\u5411\u91cf\u7684\u65cb\u8f6c\u6781\u6027\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u9690\u5f0f\u5730\u63a8\u52a8\u53c2\u6570\u5411\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u66f4\u5e73\u5766\u7684\u533a\u57df\u79fb\u52a8\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u6539\u5584\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u68af\u5ea6\u4e0b\u964d\u5206\u6790\u57fa\u4e8eHessian\u77e9\u9635\u6700\u5927\u7279\u5f81\u503c\u5b9a\u4e49\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u9608\u503c\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u4ee3\u6df1\u5ea6\u7f51\u7edc\u5f80\u5f80\u5728\u8d85\u51fa\u8be5\u9608\u503c\u7684\u533a\u57df\u83b7\u5f97\u6700\u4f73\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u7406\u89e3\u8fd9\u79cd\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u7684\u79ef\u6781\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u65cb\u8f6c\u6781\u6027\u7279\u5f81\u5411\u91cf(RPE)\u51e0\u4f55\u73b0\u8c61\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u65f6Hessian\u77e9\u9635\u4e3b\u5bfc\u7279\u5f81\u5411\u91cf\u7684\u65cb\u8f6c\u5982\u4f55\u4fc3\u8fdb\u63a2\u7d22\u5e76\u5bfc\u5411\u66f4\u5e73\u5766\u7684\u6700\u5c0f\u503c\u3002", "result": "\u7406\u8bba\u8bc1\u660e\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u5e73\u5766\u5316\u5728\u968f\u673a\u68af\u5ea6\u4e0b\u964d\u4e2d\u6301\u7eed\u5b58\u5728\uff0c\u5176\u7ecf\u9a8c\u6548\u679c\u8d85\u8fc7\u5c0f\u6279\u91cf\u566a\u58f0\uff1b\u5728Adam\u4f18\u5316\u5668\u4e2d\u6062\u590d\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u53ef\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u6539\u5584\u6cdb\u5316\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u5728\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u5efa\u8bbe\u6027\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7RPE\u673a\u5236\u9690\u5f0f\u504f\u7f6e\u53c2\u6570\u5411\u5e73\u5766\u533a\u57df\u79fb\u52a8\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63d0\u5347\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

In this paper, we firstly propose a novel multimodal approach that efficiently processes SPICE files through large-scale netlist transformer (LNT). Our key innovation is representing and processing netlist topology as 3D point cloud representations, enabling efficient handling of netlist with up to hundreds of thousands to millions nodes. All types of data, including netlist files and image data, are encoded into latent space as features and fed into the model for static voltage drop prediction. This enables the integration of data from multiple modalities for complementary predictions.

We introduce PID-controlled Langevin Dynamics (PIDLD), a novel sampling acceleration algorithm that reinterprets the sampling process using control-theoretic principles. By treating energy gradients as feedback signals, PIDLD combines historical gradients (the integral term) and gradient trends (the derivative term) to efficiently traverse energy landscapes and adaptively stabilize, thereby significantly reducing the number of iterations required to produce high-quality samples. Our approach requires no additional training, datasets, or prior information, making it immediately integrable with any Langevin-based method. Extensive experiments across image generation and reasoning tasks demonstrate that PIDLD achieves higher quality with fewer steps, making Langevin-based generative models more practical for efficiency-critical applications.

We propose FedTopo, a framework that integrates Topological-Guided Block Screening (TGBS) and Topological Embedding (TE) to leverage topological information, yielding coherently aligned cross-client representations by Topological Alignment Loss (TAL). First, Topology-Guided Block Screening (TGBS) automatically selects the most topology-informative block, i.e., the one with maximal topological separability, whose persistence-based signatures best distinguish within- versus between-class pairs, ensuring that subsequent analysis focuses on topology-rich features. Next, this block yields a compact Topological Embedding, which quantifies the topological information for each client. Finally, a Topological Alignment Loss (TAL) guides clients to maintain topological consistency with the global model during optimization, reducing representation drift across rounds.

We explore the algorithm's conceptual simplicity and its transition from online to batch learning, which contributed to its stability. Despite its initial success, NFQ required extensive tuning and was not easily reproducible on real-world control problems. We propose a modernized variant NFQ2.0 and apply it to the CartPole task, concentrating on a real-world system build from standard industrial components, to investigate and improve the learning process's repeatability and robustness. Through ablation studies, we highlight key design decisions and hyperparameters that enhance performance and stability of NFQ2.0 over the original variant. Finally, we demonstrate how our findings can assist practitioners in reproducing and improving results and applying deep reinforcement learning more effectively in industrial contexts.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u91cd\u65b0\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e8620\u5e74\u524d\u7684NFQ\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u73b0\u4ee3\u5316\u53d8\u4f53NFQ2.0\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6d88\u878d\u7814\u7a76\u8bc6\u522b\u5173\u952e\u8bbe\u8ba1\u51b3\u7b56\u548c\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u5728\u5de5\u4e1a\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u53ef\u91cd\u590d\u6027\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "NFQ\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6df1\u5ea6\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u5148\u9a71\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u867d\u7136\u6982\u5ff5\u7b80\u5355\u4e14\u7a33\u5b9a\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u63a7\u5236\u95ee\u9898\u4e2d\u9700\u8981\u5927\u91cf\u8c03\u53c2\u4e14\u96be\u4ee5\u590d\u73b0\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u6539\u8fdb\u5176\u5b66\u4e60\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u91cd\u590d\u6027\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faNFQ2.0\u73b0\u4ee3\u5316\u53d8\u4f53\uff0c\u5728\u6807\u51c6\u5de5\u4e1a\u7ec4\u4ef6\u6784\u5efa\u7684\u771f\u5b9eCartPole\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6d88\u878d\u7814\u7a76\u5206\u6790\u5173\u952e\u8bbe\u8ba1\u51b3\u7b56\u548c\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "NFQ2.0\u76f8\u6bd4\u539f\u59cb\u7248\u672c\u5728\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u90fd\u6709\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u51fa\u4e86\u589e\u5f3a\u5b66\u4e60\u6548\u679c\u7684\u5173\u952e\u56e0\u7d20\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u4ece\u4e1a\u8005\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u590d\u73b0\u548c\u6539\u8fdb\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u5de5\u4e1a\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u5730\u5e94\u7528\u6df1\u5ea6\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u3002"}}

Extending this to multiclass classification has long been challenging, since Natarajan's work in the late 80s proposing the Natarajan dimension (Nat) as a natural analogue of VC. Daniely and Shalev-Shwartz (2014) introduced the DS dimension, later shown by Brukhim et al. (2022) to characterize multiclass learnability. Brukhim et al. also showed that Nat and DS can diverge arbitrarily, suggesting that multiclass learning is governed by DS rather than Nat. We show that agnostic multiclass PAC sample complexity is in fact governed by two distinct dimensions. Specifically, we prove nearly tight agnostic sample complexity bounds that, up to log factors, take the form $\\frac{DS^{1.5}}\u03b5 + \\frac{Nat}{\u03b5^2}$ where $\u03b5$ is the excess risk. This bound is tight up to a $\\sqrt{DS}$ factor in the first term, nearly matching known $Nat/\u03b5^2$ and $DS/\u03b5$ lower bounds. The first term reflects the DS-controlled regime, while the second shows that the Natarajan dimension still dictates asymptotic behavior for small $\u03b5$. Thus, unlike binary or online classification -- where a single dimension (VC or Littlestone) controls both phenomena -- multiclass learning inherently involves two structural parameters. Our technical approach departs from traditional agnostic learning methods based on uniform convergence or reductions to realizable cases. A key ingredient is a novel online procedure based on a self-adaptive multiplicative-weights algorithm performing a label-space reduction, which may be of independent interest.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u591a\u7c7b\u522bPAC\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u6837\u672c\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u7531\u4e24\u4e2a\u7ef4\u5ea6\u5171\u540c\u51b3\u5b9a\uff1aDS^{1.5}/\u03b5 + Nat/\u03b5\u00b2\uff0c\u5176\u4e2dDS\u7ef4\u5ea6\u63a7\u5236\u4e3b\u5bfc\u9879\uff0cNatarajan\u7ef4\u5ea6\u51b3\u5b9a\u5c0f\u03b5\u65f6\u7684\u6e10\u8fd1\u884c\u4e3a", "motivation": "\u6269\u5c55\u4e8c\u5143PAC\u5b66\u4e60\u7684VC\u7ef4\u5ea6\u7406\u8bba\u5230\u591a\u7c7b\u522b\u5206\u7c7b\uff0c\u7406\u89e3\u591a\u7c7b\u522b\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u4e0d\u540c\u7ef4\u5ea6\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\u673a\u5236", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u4e58\u6027\u6743\u91cd\u7684\u5728\u7ebf\u7b97\u6cd5\u8fdb\u884c\u6807\u7b7e\u7a7a\u95f4\u7ea6\u7b80\uff0c\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edf\u57fa\u4e8e\u5747\u5300\u6536\u655b\u6216\u53ef\u5b9e\u60c5\u51b5\u7ea6\u7b80\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0d\u540c", "result": "\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u591a\u7c7b\u522bPAC\u6837\u672c\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u7684\u7d27\u754c\uff0c\u663e\u793aDS\u7ef4\u5ea6\u548cNatarajan\u7ef4\u5ea6\u5171\u540c\u63a7\u5236\u5b66\u4e60\u8fc7\u7a0b", "conclusion": "\u591a\u7c7b\u522b\u5b66\u4e60\u672c\u8d28\u4e0a\u6d89\u53ca\u4e24\u4e2a\u7ed3\u6784\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u4e0e\u4e8c\u5143\u6216\u5728\u7ebf\u5206\u7c7b\u4e2d\u5355\u4e00\u7ef4\u5ea6\u63a7\u5236\u7684\u73b0\u8c61\u5f62\u6210\u5bf9\u6bd4"}}

Within this paradigm, the intellectual property rights (IPR) of client models are critical assets that must be protected. In practice, the central server responsible for maintaining the global model may maliciously manipulate the global model to erase client contributions or falsely claim sole ownership, thereby infringing on clients' IPR. Watermarking has emerged as a promising technique for asserting model ownership and protecting intellectual property. However, existing FL watermarking approaches remain limited, suffering from potential watermark collisions among clients, insufficient watermark security, and non-intuitive verification mechanisms. In this paper, we propose FLClear, a novel framework that simultaneously achieves collision-free watermark aggregation, enhanced watermark security, and visually interpretable ownership verification. Specifically, FLClear introduces a transposed model jointly optimized with contrastive learning to integrate the watermarking and main task objectives. During verification, the watermark is reconstructed from the transposed model and evaluated through both visual inspection and structural similarity metrics, enabling intuitive and quantitative ownership verification. Comprehensive experiments conducted over various datasets, aggregation schemes, and attack scenarios demonstrate the effectiveness of FLClear and confirm that it consistently outperforms state-of-the-art FL watermarking methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "FLClear\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u6c34\u5370\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8f6c\u7f6e\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u5b9e\u73b0\u65e0\u51b2\u7a81\u6c34\u5370\u805a\u5408\u3001\u589e\u5f3a\u6c34\u5370\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\u6240\u6709\u6743\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "motivation": "\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\uff0c\u4e2d\u592e\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u53ef\u80fd\u6076\u610f\u64cd\u7eb5\u5168\u5c40\u6a21\u578b\u4ee5\u5220\u9664\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u8d21\u732e\u6216\u865a\u5047\u58f0\u79f0\u6240\u6709\u6743\uff0c\u4fb5\u72af\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u77e5\u8bc6\u4ea7\u6743\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u6c34\u5370\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u6c34\u5370\u51b2\u7a81\u3001\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u4e0d\u8db3\u548c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u673a\u5236\u4e0d\u76f4\u89c2\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faFLClear\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u8f6c\u7f6e\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u8054\u5408\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u96c6\u6210\u6c34\u5370\u548c\u4e3b\u4efb\u52a1\u76ee\u6807\u3002\u9a8c\u8bc1\u65f6\u901a\u8fc7\u8f6c\u7f6e\u6a21\u578b\u91cd\u6784\u6c34\u5370\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u89c6\u89c9\u68c0\u67e5\u548c\u7ed3\u6784\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u6307\u6807\u8fdb\u884c\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3001\u805a\u5408\u65b9\u6848\u548c\u653b\u51fb\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u7efc\u5408\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cFLClear\u6709\u6548\u4e14\u6301\u7eed\u4f18\u4e8e\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u6c34\u5370\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "FLClear\u6210\u529f\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u65e0\u51b2\u7a81\u6c34\u5370\u805a\u5408\u3001\u589e\u5f3a\u6c34\u5370\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u548c\u76f4\u89c2\u6240\u6709\u6743\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u4e3a\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u4ea7\u6743\u4fdd\u62a4\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

This work introduces an efficient reduced-order modeling (ROM) framework for short-range weather prediction and investigates fundamental questions in dimensionality reduction and reduced order modeling of such systems. Unlike recent AI-driven models, which require extensive computational resources, our framework prioritizes efficiency while achieving reasonable accuracy. Specifically, a ResNet-based convolutional autoencoder augmented by block attention modules is developed to reduce the dimensionality of high-dimensional weather data. Subsequently, a linear operator is learned in the time-delayed embedding of the latent space to efficiently capture the dynamics. Using the ERA5 reanalysis dataset, we demonstrate that this framework performs well in-distribution as evidenced by effectively predicting weather patterns within training data periods. We also identify important limitations in generalizing to future states, particularly in maintaining prediction accuracy beyond the training window. Our analysis reveals that weather systems exhibit strong temporal correlations that can be effectively captured through linear operations in an appropriately constructed embedding space, and that projection error rather than inference error is the main bottleneck. These findings shed light on some key challenges in reduced-order modeling of chaotic systems and point toward opportunities for hybrid approaches that combine efficient reduced-order models as baselines with more sophisticated AI architectures, particularly for applications in long-term climate modeling where computational efficiency is paramount.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7528\u4e8e\u77ed\u671f\u5929\u6c14\u9884\u62a5\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u964d\u9636\u5efa\u6a21\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u57fa\u4e8eResNet\u7684\u5377\u79ef\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u548c\u5757\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6a21\u5757\u6765\u964d\u4f4e\u9ad8\u7ef4\u5929\u6c14\u6570\u636e\u7684\u7ef4\u5ea6\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u5ef6\u8fdf\u5d4c\u5165\u7684\u6f5c\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e60\u7ebf\u6027\u7b97\u5b50\u6765\u6355\u6349\u52a8\u6001\u3002", "motivation": "\u5929\u6c14\u9884\u62a5\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u590d\u6742\u3001\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u3001\u6df7\u6c8c\u7684\u9ad8\u7ef4\u52a8\u529b\u7cfb\u7edf\u9884\u6d4b\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u4e0e\u9700\u8981\u5927\u91cf\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\u7684AI\u9a71\u52a8\u6a21\u578b\u4e0d\u540c\uff0c\u672c\u6846\u67b6\u4f18\u5148\u8003\u8651\u6548\u7387\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u5408\u7406\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8eResNet\u7684\u5377\u79ef\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u5757\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6a21\u5757\u6765\u964d\u4f4e\u5929\u6c14\u6570\u636e\u7684\u7ef4\u5ea6\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u5728\u6f5c\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u5ef6\u8fdf\u5d4c\u5165\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e60\u7ebf\u6027\u7b97\u5b50\u6765\u9ad8\u6548\u6355\u6349\u52a8\u6001\u3002", "result": "\u4f7f\u7528ERA5\u518d\u5206\u6790\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8bc1\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u671f\u95f4\u5185\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u9884\u6d4b\u5929\u6c14\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u6cdb\u5316\u5230\u672a\u6765\u72b6\u6001\u65f6\u5b58\u5728\u91cd\u8981\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u7a97\u53e3\u4e4b\u5916\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4fdd\u6301\u65b9\u9762\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5929\u6c14\u7cfb\u7edf\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u5f3a\u65f6\u95f4\u76f8\u5173\u6027\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u9002\u5f53\u6784\u5efa\u7684\u5d4c\u5165\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u7684\u7ebf\u6027\u64cd\u4f5c\u6709\u6548\u6355\u6349\uff0c\u6295\u5f71\u8bef\u5dee\u800c\u975e\u63a8\u65ad\u8bef\u5dee\u662f\u4e3b\u8981\u74f6\u9888\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u53d1\u73b0\u4e3a\u6df7\u6c8c\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u964d\u9636\u5efa\u6a21\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5173\u952e\u6311\u6218\u7684\u89c1\u89e3\uff0c\u5e76\u6307\u5411\u5c06\u9ad8\u6548\u964d\u9636\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u66f4\u590d\u6742AI\u67b6\u6784\u7ed3\u5408\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\u673a\u4f1a\u3002"}}

Random sampling of task-level pairs often produces unsolvable combinations, highlighting the need to co-design tasks and levels.

We present ATLAS (Aligning Tasks and Levels for Autocurricula of Specifications), a novel method that generates joint autocurricula over tasks and levels. Our approach builds upon UED to automatically produce solvable yet challenging task-level pairs for policy training. To evaluate ATLAS and drive progress in the field, we introduce an evaluation suite that models tasks as reward machines in Minigrid levels.

However, the mesh refinement techniques which allocate finer resolution to regions with steep gradients can induce the over-squashing problem in mesh-based GNNs, which prevents the capture of long-range physical interactions. Conventional graph rewiring methods attempt to alleviate this issue by adding new edges, but they typically complete all rewiring operations before applying them to the GNN. These approaches are physically unrealistic, as they assume instantaneous interactions between distant nodes and disregard the distance information between particles. To address these limitations, we propose a novel framework, called Adaptive Graph Rewiring in Mesh-Based Graph Neural Networks (AdaMeshNet), that introduces an adaptive rewiring process into the message-passing procedure to model the gradual propagation of physical interactions. Our method computes a rewiring delay score for bottleneck nodes in the mesh graph, based on the shortest-path distance and the velocity difference. Using this score, it dynamically selects the message-passing layer at which new edges are rewired, which can lead to adaptive rewiring in a mesh graph. Extensive experiments on mesh-based fluid simulations demonstrate that AdaMeshNet outperforms conventional rewiring methods, effectively modeling the sequential nature of physical interactions and enabling more accurate predictions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faAdaMeshNet\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5728\u57fa\u4e8e\u7f51\u683c\u7684\u56fe\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u5f15\u5165\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u91cd\u8fde\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8ba1\u7b97\u91cd\u8fde\u5ef6\u8fdf\u5206\u6570\u52a8\u6001\u9009\u62e9\u6d88\u606f\u4f20\u9012\u5c42\u8fdb\u884c\u91cd\u8fde\uff0c\u4ee5\u5efa\u6a21\u7269\u7406\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u7684\u6e10\u8fdb\u4f20\u64ad\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u7f51\u683c\u91cd\u8fde\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5e94\u7528GNN\u524d\u5b8c\u6210\u6240\u6709\u91cd\u8fde\u64cd\u4f5c\uff0c\u5047\u8bbe\u8fdc\u8ddd\u79bb\u8282\u70b9\u95f4\u77ac\u65f6\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u4e14\u5ffd\u7565\u7c92\u5b50\u95f4\u8ddd\u79bb\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u8fd9\u5728\u7269\u7406\u4e0a\u662f\u4e0d\u73b0\u5b9e\u7684\u3002\u7f51\u683c\u7ec6\u5316\u6280\u672f\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4GNN\u4e2d\u7684\u8fc7\u5ea6\u538b\u7f29\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u963b\u788d\u957f\u7a0b\u7269\u7406\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u7684\u6355\u6349\u3002", "method": "AdaMeshNet\u5728\u6d88\u606f\u4f20\u9012\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u5f15\u5165\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u91cd\u8fde\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u4e3a\u7f51\u683c\u56fe\u4e2d\u7684\u74f6\u9888\u8282\u70b9\u8ba1\u7b97\u57fa\u4e8e\u6700\u77ed\u8def\u5f84\u8ddd\u79bb\u548c\u901f\u5ea6\u5dee\u7684\u91cd\u8fde\u5ef6\u8fdf\u5206\u6570\uff0c\u52a8\u6001\u9009\u62e9\u6d88\u606f\u4f20\u9012\u5c42\u8fdb\u884c\u91cd\u8fde\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u57fa\u4e8e\u7f51\u683c\u7684\u6d41\u4f53\u6a21\u62df\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0cAdaMeshNet\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u91cd\u8fde\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u5efa\u6a21\u7269\u7406\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u7684\u987a\u5e8f\u6027\u8d28\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u3002", "conclusion": "AdaMeshNet\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u91cd\u8fde\u8fc7\u7a0b\u6210\u529f\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e2d\u7269\u7406\u4e0d\u73b0\u5b9e\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u6355\u6349\u957f\u7a0b\u7269\u7406\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u6d41\u4f53\u6a21\u62df\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002"}}

It has been applied to various domains, including drug-target interactions, RNA-disease associations, and regulatory network inference. Despite being widely investigated, current methods still present drawbacks, as they are often designed for a specific application and thus do not generalize to other problems or present scalability issues. To address these challenges, we propose Oxytrees: proxy-based biclustering model trees. Oxytrees compress the interaction matrix into row- and column-wise proxy matrices, significantly reducing training time without compromising predictive performance. We also propose a new leaf-assignment algorithm that significantly reduces the time taken for prediction. Finally, Oxytrees employ linear models using the Kronecker product kernel in their leaves, resulting in shallower trees and thus even faster training. Using 15 datasets, we compared the predictive performance of ensembles of Oxytrees with that of the current state-of-the-art.

In a targeted data poisoning attack, an adversary manipulates the training dataset to alter the classification of a targeted test point. Given the typically large size of training dataset, manual detection of poisoning is difficult. An alternative is to automatically measure a dataset's robustness against such an attack, which is the focus of this paper. We consider a threat model wherein an adversary can only perturb the labels of the training dataset, with knowledge limited to the hypothesis space of the victim's model. In this setting, we prove that finding the robustness is an NP-Complete problem, even when hypotheses are linear classifiers. To overcome this, we present a technique that finds lower and upper bounds of robustness. Our implementation of the technique computes these bounds efficiently in practice for many publicly available datasets. We experimentally demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. Specifically, a poisoning exceeding the identified robustness bounds significantly impacts test point classification. We are also able to compute these bounds in many more cases where state-of-the-art techniques fail.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u81ea\u52a8\u6d4b\u91cf\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5bf9\u6807\u7b7e\u6270\u52a8\u653b\u51fb\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8ba1\u7b97\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e0a\u4e0b\u754c\u6765\u8bc4\u4f30\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u6bd2\u653b\u51fb\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "motivation": "\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u6bd2\u653b\u51fb\u901a\u8fc7\u64cd\u7eb5\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u6765\u6539\u53d8\u76ee\u6807\u6d4b\u8bd5\u70b9\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u7531\u4e8e\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u901a\u5e38\u5f88\u5927\uff0c\u624b\u52a8\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e2d\u6bd2\u5f88\u56f0\u96be\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u81ea\u52a8\u6d4b\u91cf\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u5728\u653b\u51fb\u8005\u53ea\u80fd\u6270\u52a8\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u6807\u7b7e\u4e14\u4ec5\u77e5\u9053\u53d7\u5bb3\u8005\u6a21\u578b\u5047\u8bbe\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u5a01\u80c1\u6a21\u578b\u4e0b\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u8ba1\u7b97\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e0a\u4e0b\u754c\u7684\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5c3d\u7ba1\u8bc1\u660e\u627e\u5230\u7cbe\u786e\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u662fNP\u5b8c\u5168\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5b9e\u8df5\u4e2d\u80fd\u9ad8\u6548\u8ba1\u7b97\u8bb8\u591a\u516c\u5f00\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u8fb9\u754c\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u8d85\u51fa\u8fd9\u4e9b\u8fb9\u754c\u7684\u653b\u51fb\u4f1a\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd\u6d4b\u8bd5\u70b9\u5206\u7c7b\uff0c\u4e14\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u6280\u672f\u80fd\u5904\u7406\u66f4\u591a\u60c5\u51b5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u8fb9\u754c\u8ba1\u7b97\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u8bc4\u4f30\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5bf9\u6807\u7b7e\u6270\u52a8\u653b\u51fb\u7684\u8106\u5f31\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u6bd2\u9632\u5fa1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

However, intermediate layers contain rich and complementary information -- ranging from low-level patterns to high-level abstractions -- that is often discarded when the decision head depends solely on the last representation. This paper revisits the role of the output layer and introduces LAYA (Layer-wise Attention Aggregator), a novel output head that dynamically aggregates internal representations through attention. Instead of projecting only the deepest embedding, LAYA learns input-conditioned attention weights over layer-wise features, yielding an interpretable and architecture-agnostic mechanism for synthesizing predictions. Experiments on vision and language benchmarks show that LAYA consistently matches or improves the performance of standard output heads, with relative gains of up to about one percentage point in accuracy, while providing explicit layer-attribution scores that reveal how different abstraction levels contribute to each decision. Crucially, these interpretability signals emerge directly from the model's computation, without any external post hoc explanations.

This creates a ``self-consuming loop\" that can lead to training instability or \\textit{model collapse}. Common strategies to address the issue -- such as accumulating historical training data or injecting fresh real data -- either increase computational cost or require expensive human annotation. In this paper, we empirically analyze the latent space dynamics of self-consuming diffusion models and observe that the low-dimensional structure of latent representations extracted from synthetic data degrade over generations.

A Case Study on LLM-Guided Reinforcement Learning for Decentralized Autonomous Driving", "comment": null, "summary": "Autonomous vehicle navigation in complex environments such as dense and fast-moving highways and merging scenarios remains an active area of research. A key limitation of RL is its reliance on well-specified reward functions, which often fail to capture the full semantic and social complexity of diverse, out-of-distribution situations. As a result, a rapidly growing line of research explores using Large Language Models (LLMs) to replace or supplement RL for direct planning and control, on account of their ability to reason about rich semantic context. However, LLMs present significant drawbacks: they can be unstable in zero-shot safety-critical settings, produce inconsistent outputs, and often depend on expensive API calls with network latency. This motivates our investigation into whether small, locally deployed LLMs (< 14B parameters) can meaningfully support autonomous highway driving through reward shaping rather than direct control. We present a case study comparing RL-only, LLM-only, and hybrid approaches, where LLMs augment RL rewards by scoring state-action transitions during training, while standard RL policies execute at test time. Our findings reveal that RL-only agents achieve moderate success rates (73-89%) with reasonable efficiency, LLM-only agents can reach higher success rates (up to 94%) but with severely degraded speed performance, and hybrid approaches consistently fall between these extremes. Critically, despite explicit efficiency instructions, LLM-influenced approaches exhibit systematic conservative bias with substantial model-dependent variability, highlighting important limitations of current small LLMs for safety-critical control tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86\u7eaf\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u3001\u7eaf\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4ee5\u53ca\u6df7\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u9ad8\u901f\u516c\u8def\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u6df7\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\u867d\u7136\u80fd\u63d0\u9ad8\u6210\u529f\u7387\u4f46\u5b58\u5728\u4fdd\u5b88\u504f\u5dee\u548c\u6548\u7387\u4e0b\u964d\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3RL\u5728\u590d\u6742\u9ad8\u901f\u516c\u8def\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u5956\u52b1\u51fd\u6570\u96be\u4ee5\u5168\u9762\u6355\u6349\u8bed\u4e49\u548c\u793e\u4f1a\u590d\u6742\u6027\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u907f\u514dLLM\u76f4\u63a5\u63a7\u5236\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u5ef6\u8fdf\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u5c0f\u578b\u672c\u5730\u90e8\u7f72LLM\uff08<14B\u53c2\u6570\uff09\u901a\u8fc7\u5956\u52b1\u5851\u5f62\u6765\u589e\u5f3aRL\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u671f\u95f4\u5bf9\u72b6\u6001-\u52a8\u4f5c\u8f6c\u6362\u8fdb\u884c\u8bc4\u5206\uff0c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u4ecd\u4f7f\u7528\u6807\u51c6RL\u7b56\u7565\u6267\u884c\u3002", "result": "\u7eafRL\u6210\u529f\u738773-89%\uff0c\u7eafLLM\u53ef\u8fbe94%\u4f46\u901f\u5ea6\u6027\u80fd\u4e25\u91cd\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u6df7\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ecb\u4e8e\u4e24\u8005\u4e4b\u95f4\uff0c\u4f46LLM\u5f71\u54cd\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u4fdd\u5b88\u504f\u5dee\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\u53d8\u5f02\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f53\u524d\u5c0f\u578bLLM\u5728\u5b89\u5168\u5173\u952e\u63a7\u5236\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u91cd\u8981\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u6548\u7387\u548c\u4fdd\u5b88\u6027\u65b9\u9762\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u6539\u8fdb\u624d\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u652f\u6301\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u3002"}}

They promise accelerated simulations while adhering to physical constraints. However, as shown in our theoretical framework, directly applying learned corrections to solver outputs leads to significant autoregressive errors, which originate from amplified perturbations that accumulate during long-term rollouts, especially in chaotic regimes. To overcome this, we propose the Indirect Neural Corrector (\\(\\mathrm{INC}\\)), which integrates learned corrections into the governing equations rather than applying direct state updates. Our key insight is that \\(\\mathrm{INC}\\) reduces the error amplification on the order of \\(\u0394t^{-1} + L\\), where \\(\u0394t\\) is the timestep and $L$ the Lipschitz constant. At the same time, our framework poses no architectural requirements and integrates seamlessly with arbitrary neural networks and solvers. We test \\(\\mathrm{INC}\\) in extensive benchmarks, covering numerous differentiable solvers, neural backbones, and test cases ranging from a 1D chaotic system to 3D turbulence. INC improves the long-term trajectory performance (\\(R^2\\)) by up to 158.7\\%, stabilizes blowups under aggressive coarsening, and for complex 3D turbulence cases yields speed-ups of several orders of magnitude. INC thus enables stable, efficient PDE emulation with formal error reduction, paving the way for faster scientific and engineering simulations with reliable physics guarantees.

Molecule language models (MoLMs) have become powerful tools in these domains, integrating structural representations (e.g., SMILES strings, molecular graphs) with rich contextual descriptions (e.g., physicochemical properties). However, MoLMs can encode and propagate inaccuracies due to outdated web-mined training corpora or malicious manipulation, jeopardizing downstream discovery pipelines. While knowledge editing has been explored for general-domain AI, its application to MoLMs remains uncharted, presenting unique challenges due to the multifaceted and interdependent nature of molecular knowledge. In this paper, we take the first step toward MoLM editing for two critical tasks: molecule-to-caption generation and caption-to-molecule generation. To address molecule-specific challenges, we propose MolEdit, a powerful framework that enables targeted modifications while preserving unrelated molecular knowledge. MolEdit combines a Multi-Expert Knowledge Adapter that routes edits to specialized experts for different molecular facets with an Expertise-Aware Editing Switcher that activates the adapters only when input closely matches the stored edits across all expertise, minimizing interference with unrelated knowledge. To systematically evaluate editing performance, we introduce MEBench, a comprehensive benchmark assessing multiple dimensions, including Reliability (accuracy of the editing), Locality (preservation of irrelevant knowledge), and Generality (robustness to reformed queries). Across extensive experiments on two popular MoLM backbones, MolEdit delivers up to 18.8% higher Reliability and 12.0% better Locality than baselines while maintaining efficiency.

To appear in AAAI'26", "summary": "We study the problem of efficiently estimating policies that simultaneously optimize multiple objectives in reinforcement learning (RL). Given $n$ objectives (or tasks), we seek the optimal partition of these objectives into $k \\ll n$ groups, where each group comprises related objectives that can be trained together. This problem arises in applications such as robotics, control, and preference optimization in language models, where learning a single policy for all $n$ objectives is suboptimal as $n$ grows. We introduce a two-stage procedure -- meta-training followed by fine-tuning -- to address this problem. We first learn a meta-policy for all objectives using multitask learning. Then, we adapt the meta-policy to multiple randomly sampled subsets of objectives. The adaptation step leverages a first-order approximation property of well-trained policy networks, which is empirically verified to be accurate within a $2\\%$ error margin across various RL environments. The resulting algorithm, PolicyGradEx, efficiently estimates an aggregate task-affinity score matrix given a policy evaluation algorithm. Based on the estimated affinity score matrix, we cluster the $n$ objectives into $k$ groups by maximizing the intra-cluster affinity scores. Experiments on three robotic control and the Meta-World benchmarks demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by $16\\%$ on average, while delivering up to $26\\times$ faster speedup relative to performing full training to obtain the clusters. Ablation studies validate each component of our approach. For instance, compared with random grouping and gradient-similarity-based grouping, our loss-based clustering yields an improvement of $19\\%$.

While recent work has explored horizon selection by preserving forecasting-relevant information in an intrinsic space, these approaches are primarily restricted to centralized and independently distributed settings. This paper presents a principled framework for adaptive horizon selection in federated time series forecasting through an intrinsic space formulation. We introduce a synthetic data generator (SDG) that captures essential temporal structures in client data, including autoregressive dependencies, seasonality, and trend, while incorporating client-specific heterogeneity. Building on this model, we define a transformation that maps time series windows into an intrinsic representation space with well-defined geometric and statistical properties. We then derive a decomposition of the forecasting loss into a Bayesian term, which reflects irreducible uncertainty, and an approximation term, which accounts for finite-sample effects and limited model capacity. Our analysis shows that while increasing the look-back horizon improves the identifiability of deterministic patterns, it also increases approximation error due to higher model complexity and reduced sample efficiency. We prove that the total forecasting loss is minimized at the smallest horizon where the irreducible loss starts to saturate, while the approximation loss continues to rise.

In fact, prior work often attributes this emergent behavior to distinctive statistical properties in human language. This raises a fundamental question: can ICL arise organically in other sequence domains purely through large-scale predictive training?\n  To explore this, we turn to genomic sequences, an alternative symbolic domain rich in statistical structure. Specifically, we study the Evo2 genomic model, trained predominantly on next-nucleotide (A/T/C/G) prediction, at a scale comparable to mid-sized LLMs. We develop a controlled experimental framework comprising symbolic reasoning tasks instantiated in both linguistic and genomic forms, enabling direct comparison of ICL across genomic and linguistic models. Our results show that genomic models, like their linguistic counterparts, exhibit log-linear gains in pattern induction as the number of in-context demonstrations increases. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first evidence of organically emergent ICL in genomic sequences, supporting the hypothesis that ICL arises as a consequence of large-scale predictive modeling over rich data.

We provide the first formal foundation for analyzing the long-term effects of such recursive retraining on alignment. Under a two-stage curation mechanism based on the Bradley-Terry (BT) model, we model alignment as an interaction between two factions: the Model Owner, who filters which outputs should be learned by the model, and the Public User, who determines which outputs are ultimately shared and retained through interactions with the model. Our analysis reveals three structural convergence regimes depending on the degree of preference alignment: consensus collapse, compromise on shared optima, and asymmetric refinement. We prove a fundamental impossibility theorem: no recursive BT-based curation mechanism can simultaneously preserve diversity, ensure symmetric influence, and eliminate dependence on initialization. Framing the process as dynamic social choice, we show that alignment is not a static goal but an evolving equilibrium, shaped both by power asymmetries and path dependence.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u9996\u6b21\u4e3a\u5206\u6790\u81ea\u6d88\u8d39\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u9012\u5f52\u518d\u8bad\u7ec3\u5bf9\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u957f\u671f\u5f71\u54cd\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u4e09\u79cd\u7ed3\u6784\u6536\u655b\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u9012\u5f52BT\u7b56\u5c55\u673a\u5236\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u591a\u6837\u6027\u3001\u786e\u4fdd\u5bf9\u79f0\u5f71\u54cd\u548c\u6d88\u9664\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u4f9d\u8d56\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u57fa\u672c\u4e0d\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u81ea\u6d88\u8d39\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u57fa\u4e8e\u81ea\u8eab\u8f93\u51fa\u8fdb\u884c\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u4f7f\u5f97\u4e0e\u7528\u6237\u504f\u597d\u7684\u5bf9\u9f50\u6210\u4e3a\u4e00\u4e2a\u9012\u5f52\u800c\u975e\u4e00\u6b21\u6027\u7684\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002\u9700\u8981\u5efa\u7acb\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u57fa\u7840\u6765\u5206\u6790\u8fd9\u79cd\u9012\u5f52\u518d\u8bad\u7ec3\u5bf9\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u957f\u671f\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8eBradley-Terry\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u7b56\u5c55\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5c06\u5bf9\u9f50\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u6a21\u578b\u6240\u6709\u8005\uff08\u8fc7\u6ee4\u54ea\u4e9b\u8f93\u51fa\u5e94\u88ab\u5b66\u4e60\uff09\u548c\u516c\u5171\u7528\u6237\uff08\u51b3\u5b9a\u54ea\u4e9b\u8f93\u51fa\u6700\u7ec8\u901a\u8fc7\u4ea4\u4e92\u88ab\u5171\u4eab\u548c\u4fdd\u7559\uff09\u4e24\u4e2a\u6d3e\u7cfb\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u4e92\u52a8\u3002", "result": "\u5206\u6790\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u4e09\u79cd\u7ed3\u6784\u6536\u655b\u673a\u5236\uff1a\u5171\u8bc6\u5d29\u6e83\u3001\u5171\u4eab\u6700\u4f18\u7684\u59a5\u534f\u548c\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u7ec6\u5316\u3002\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u57fa\u672c\u4e0d\u53ef\u80fd\u5b9a\u7406\uff1a\u4efb\u4f55\u57fa\u4e8eBT\u7684\u9012\u5f52\u7b56\u5c55\u673a\u5236\u90fd\u65e0\u6cd5\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u591a\u6837\u6027\u3001\u786e\u4fdd\u5bf9\u79f0\u5f71\u54cd\u548c\u6d88\u9664\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u4f9d\u8d56\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5c06\u5bf9\u9f50\u8fc7\u7a0b\u6846\u67b6\u5316\u4e3a\u52a8\u6001\u793e\u4f1a\u9009\u62e9\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u5bf9\u9f50\u4e0d\u662f\u9759\u6001\u76ee\u6807\u800c\u662f\u6f14\u5316\u5747\u8861\uff0c\u65e2\u53d7\u6743\u529b\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u4e5f\u53d7\u8def\u5f84\u4f9d\u8d56\u5f71\u54cd\u3002"}}

Yet, deploying LLMs in high-stakes healthcare settings requires rigorous verification and validation to understand any potential harm. This paper investigates the reliability and viability of using medical knowledge graphs (KGs) for the automated factuality evaluation of LLM-generated responses. To ground this investigation, we introduce FAITH, a framework designed to systematically probe the strengths and limitations of this KG-based approach. FAITH operates without reference answers by decomposing responses into atomic claims, linking them to a medical KG, and scoring them based on evidence paths. Experiments on diverse medical tasks with human subjective evaluations demonstrate that KG-grounded evaluation achieves considerably higher correlations with clinician judgments and can effectively distinguish LLMs with varying capabilities. It is also robust to textual variances. The inherent explainability of its scoring can further help users understand and mitigate the limitations of current LLMs. We conclude that while limitations exist, leveraging KGs is a prominent direction for automated factuality assessment in healthcare.", "AI": {"tldr": "FAITH\u6846\u67b6\u5229\u7528\u533b\u5b66\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u81ea\u52a8\u8bc4\u4f30LLM\u751f\u6210\u56de\u7b54\u7684\u4e8b\u5b9e\u6027\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u56de\u7b54\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u539f\u5b50\u4e3b\u5f20\u5e76\u4e0e\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u94fe\u63a5\u8fdb\u884c\u8bc1\u636e\u8def\u5f84\u8bc4\u5206\uff0c\u5728\u533b\u7597\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u4e0e\u4e34\u5e8a\u533b\u751f\u5224\u65ad\u9ad8\u5ea6\u76f8\u5173\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u533b\u7597\u9886\u57df\u90e8\u7f72\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u9700\u8981\u4e25\u683c\u7684\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u7684\u4e8b\u5b9e\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u5229\u7528\u533b\u5b66\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u8fdb\u884c\u81ea\u52a8\u4e8b\u5b9e\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faFAITH\u6846\u67b6\uff1a\u5c06LLM\u56de\u7b54\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u539f\u5b50\u4e3b\u5f20\uff0c\u94fe\u63a5\u5230\u533b\u5b66\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bc1\u636e\u8def\u5f84\u8fdb\u884c\u8bc4\u5206\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u53c2\u8003\u7b54\u6848\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u57fa\u4e8e\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0e\u4e34\u5e8a\u533b\u751f\u5224\u65ad\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u663e\u8457\u66f4\u9ad8\uff0c\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u533a\u5206\u4e0d\u540c\u80fd\u529b\u7684LLM\uff0c\u5bf9\u6587\u672c\u53d8\u5316\u5177\u6709\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u8bc4\u5206\u5177\u6709\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u5229\u7528\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u662f\u533b\u7597\u9886\u57df\u81ea\u52a8\u4e8b\u5b9e\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

While various mitigation strategies have been proposed for Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs), recent architectural advances like Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) have been suggested to offer intrinsic resistance to forgetting by leveraging localized spline-based activations. However, the practical behavior of KANs under continual learning remains unclear, and their limitations are not well understood. To address this, we present a comprehensive study of catastrophic forgetting in KANs and develop a theoretical framework that links forgetting to activation support overlap and intrinsic data dimension. We validate these analyses through systematic experiments on synthetic and vision tasks, measuring forgetting dynamics under varying model configurations and data complexity. Further, we introduce KAN-LoRA, a novel adapter design for parameter-efficient continual fine-tuning of language models, and evaluate its effectiveness in knowledge editing tasks. Our findings reveal that while KANs exhibit promising retention in low-dimensional algorithmic settings, they remain vulnerable to forgetting in high-dimensional domains such as image classification and language modeling.

However, this computational burden is typically mitigated by existing efficiency methods at the cost of reduced expressivity. We propose \\textbf{Co-Sparsify}, a connectivity-aware sparsification framework that eliminates \\emph{provably redundant} computations while preserving full 2-FWL expressive power. Our key insight is that 3-node interactions are expressively necessary only within \\emph{biconnected components} -- maximal subgraphs where every pair of nodes lies on a cycle. Outside these components, structural relationships can be fully captured via 2-node message passing or global readout, rendering higher-order modeling unnecessary. Co-Sparsify restricts 2-node message passing to connected components and 3-node interactions to biconnected ones, removing computation without approximation or sampling.

To overcome these challenges, we propose RoS-Guard, a robust and optimal OCD algorithm tailored for linear systems with uncertainty. Through a tight relaxation and reformulation of the OCD optimization problem, RoS-Guard employs neural unrolling to enable efficient parallel computation via GPU acceleration.

In this work, we propose a control theoretic framework that treats a trained neural network as a nonlinear state space system and uses local linearization, controllability and observability Gramians, and Hankel singular values to analyze its internal computation. For a given input, we linearize the network around the corresponding hidden activation pattern and construct a state space model whose state consists of hidden neuron activations. The input state and state output Jacobians define local controllability and observability Gramians, from which we compute Hankel singular values and associated modes. These quantities provide a principled notion of neuron and pathway importance: controllability measures how easily each neuron can be excited by input perturbations, observability measures how strongly each neuron influences the output, and Hankel singular values rank internal modes that carry input output energy. We illustrate the framework on simple feedforward networks, including a 1 2 2 1 SwiGLU network and a 2 3 3 2 GELU network. By comparing different operating points, we show how activation saturation reduces controllability, shrinks the dominant Hankel singular value, and shifts the dominant internal mode to a different subset of neurons. The proposed method turns a neural network into a collection of local white box dynamical models and suggests which internal directions are natural candidates for pruning or constraints to improve interpretability.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u63a7\u5236\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u8bad\u7ec3\u597d\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u89c6\u4e3a\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u72b6\u6001\u7a7a\u95f4\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c40\u90e8\u7ebf\u6027\u5316\u3001\u53ef\u63a7\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u89c2\u6d4b\u6027Gramians\u4ee5\u53caHankel\u5947\u5f02\u503c\u6765\u5206\u6790\u5176\u5185\u90e8\u8ba1\u7b97\u3002", "motivation": "\u6df1\u5ea6\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u867d\u7136\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u5f02\u4f46\u96be\u4ee5\u8fdb\u884c\u673a\u5236\u6027\u89e3\u91ca\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u65b0\u7684\u5206\u6790\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u7406\u89e3\u5176\u5185\u90e8\u8ba1\u7b97\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "method": "\u5bf9\u4e8e\u7ed9\u5b9a\u8f93\u5165\uff0c\u5728\u5bf9\u5e94\u7684\u9690\u85cf\u6fc0\u6d3b\u6a21\u5f0f\u5468\u56f4\u7ebf\u6027\u5316\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u72b6\u6001\u7a7a\u95f4\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u72b6\u6001\u7531\u9690\u85cf\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\u6fc0\u6d3b\u7ec4\u6210\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u8f93\u5165\u72b6\u6001\u548c\u72b6\u6001\u8f93\u51faJacobians\u5b9a\u4e49\u5c40\u90e8\u53ef\u63a7\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u89c2\u6d4b\u6027Gramians\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97Hankel\u5947\u5f02\u503c\u548c\u76f8\u5173\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u7b80\u5355\u524d\u9988\u7f51\u7edc\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u62ec1-2-2-1 SwiGLU\u7f51\u7edc\u548c2-3-3-2 GELU\u7f51\u7edc\u3002\u53d1\u73b0\u6fc0\u6d3b\u9971\u548c\u4f1a\u964d\u4f4e\u53ef\u63a7\u6027\uff0c\u7f29\u5c0f\u4e3b\u5bfcHankel\u5947\u5f02\u503c\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u4e3b\u5bfc\u5185\u90e8\u6a21\u5f0f\u8f6c\u79fb\u5230\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\u5b50\u96c6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c06\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u5c40\u90e8\u767d\u76d2\u52a8\u6001\u6a21\u578b\u96c6\u5408\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc6\u522b\u51fa\u54ea\u4e9b\u5185\u90e8\u65b9\u5411\u662f\u526a\u679d\u6216\u7ea6\u675f\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u7684\u81ea\u7136\u5019\u9009\u8005\u3002"}}

Comparative experiments demonstrate that DDQN outperforms traditional rigid and dynamic strategies, particularly in large-scale or highly uncertain environments, exhibiting superior computational capability, policy reliability, and adaptability. Ablation studies further reveal that the dual-network architecture mitigates overestimation of action values, while the target network substantially improves training convergence and robustness.

However, when supports significantly overlap while densities exhibit substantial pointwise differences, it remains unclear whether and how this transport information can accurately identify these differences, particularly their analytic characterization in finite-sample settings. We address this issue by conducting an analysis of the information processing capabilities of the one-dimensional Wasserstein distance with finite samples. By utilizing the Poisson process and isolating the rate factor, we demonstrate the capability of capturing the pointwise density difference with Wasserstein distances and how this information harmonizes with support differences. The analyzed properties are confirmed using neural spike train decoding and amino acid contact frequency data.

This dependence on solver-based data limits scalability and constrains exploration across physical systems. Here we introduce the Method of Manufactured Learning (MML), a solver-independent framework for training neural operators using analytically constructed, physics-consistent datasets. Inspired by the classical method of manufactured solutions, MML replaces numerical data generation with functional synthesis, i.e., smooth candidate solutions are sampled from controlled analytical spaces, and the corresponding forcing fields are derived by direct application of the governing differential operators. During inference, setting these forcing terms to zero restores the original governing equations, allowing the trained neural operator to emulate the true solution operator of the system. The framework is agnostic to network architecture and can be integrated with any operator learning paradigm. In this paper, we employ Fourier neural operator as a representative example. Across canonical benchmarks including heat, advection, Burgers, and diffusion-reaction equations. MML achieves high spectral accuracy, low residual errors, and strong generalization to unseen conditions. By reframing data generation as a process of analytical synthesis, MML offers a scalable, solver-agnostic pathway toward constructing physically grounded neural operators that retain fidelity to governing laws without reliance on expensive numerical simulations or costly experimental data for training.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faMML\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u89e3\u6790\u6784\u9020\u7269\u7406\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u6765\u8bad\u7ec3\u795e\u7ecf\u7b97\u5b50\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u4f9d\u8d56\u6570\u503c\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u751f\u6210\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u5f3a\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u795e\u7ecf\u7b97\u5b50\u8bad\u7ec3\u4f9d\u8d56\u6570\u503c\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u751f\u6210\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u4e14\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u5dee\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u72ec\u7acb\u4e8e\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u5236\u9020\u89e3\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ece\u53d7\u63a7\u89e3\u6790\u7a7a\u95f4\u91c7\u6837\u5e73\u6ed1\u5019\u9009\u89e3\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u76f4\u63a5\u5e94\u7528\u5fae\u5206\u7b97\u5b50\u63a8\u5bfc\u5bf9\u5e94\u7684\u5f3a\u8feb\u573a\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u5c06\u5f3a\u8feb\u9879\u8bbe\u4e3a\u96f6\u6062\u590d\u539f\u65b9\u7a0b\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u70ed\u4f20\u5bfc\u3001\u5bf9\u6d41\u3001Burgers\u548c\u6269\u6563\u53cd\u5e94\u7b49\u57fa\u51c6\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\uff0cMML\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u8c31\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3001\u4f4e\u6b8b\u5dee\u8bef\u5dee\u548c\u5f3a\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "MML\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u3001\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u9014\u5f84\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u7269\u7406\u57fa\u7840\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u7b97\u5b50\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u4f9d\u8d56\u6602\u8d35\u7684\u6570\u503c\u6a21\u62df\u6216\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6570\u636e\u3002"}}

Principe"], "title": "Contrastive Entropy Bounds for Density and Conditional Density Decomposition", "comment": null, "summary": "This paper studies the interpretability of neural network features from a Bayesian Gaussian view, where optimizing a cost is reaching a probabilistic bound; learning a model approximates a density that makes the bound tight and the cost optimal, often with a Gaussian mixture density. The two examples are Mixture Density Networks (MDNs) using the bound for the marginal and autoencoders using the conditional bound. It is a known result, not only for autoencoders, that minimizing the error between inputs and outputs maximizes the dependence between inputs and the middle.\n  We use Hilbert space and decomposition to address cases where a multiple-output network produces multiple centers defining a Gaussian mixture. Our first finding is that an autoencoder's objective is equivalent to maximizing the trace of a Gaussian operator, the sum of eigenvalues under bases orthonormal w.r.t. the data and model distributions. This suggests that, when a one-to-one correspondence as needed in autoencoders is unnecessary, we can instead maximize the nuclear norm of this operator, the sum of singular values, to maximize overall rank rather than trace. Thus the trace of a Gaussian operator can be used to train autoencoders, and its nuclear norm can be used as divergence to train MDNs.\n  Our second test uses inner products and norms in a Hilbert space to define bounds and costs. Such bounds often have an extra norm compared to KL-based bounds, which increases sample diversity and prevents the trivial solution where a multiple-output network produces the same constant, at the cost of requiring a sample batch to estimate and optimize. We propose an encoder-mixture-decoder architecture whose decoder is multiple-output, producing multiple centers per sample, potentially tightening the bound. Assuming the data are small-variance Gaussian mixtures, this upper bound can be tracked and analyzed quantitatively.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u4ece\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u9ad8\u65af\u89c6\u89d2\u7814\u7a76\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4f7f\u7528\u9ad8\u65af\u7b97\u5b50\u8ff9\u8bad\u7ec3\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u6838\u8303\u6570\u8bad\u7ec3\u6df7\u5408\u5bc6\u5ea6\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u7f16\u7801\u5668-\u6df7\u5408-\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u67b6\u6784\u6765\u63d0\u5347\u6837\u672c\u591a\u6837\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\uff0c\u4ece\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u9ad8\u65af\u89c6\u89d2\u7406\u89e3\u4f18\u5316\u6210\u672c\u5982\u4f55\u8fbe\u5230\u6982\u7387\u754c\u9650\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u5982\u4f55\u8fd1\u4f3c\u4f7f\u754c\u9650\u7d27\u5bc6\u7684\u5bc6\u5ea6\u51fd\u6570\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u5e0c\u5c14\u4f2f\u7279\u7a7a\u95f4\u548c\u5206\u89e3\u65b9\u6cd5\u5904\u7406\u591a\u8f93\u51fa\u7f51\u7edc\u4ea7\u751f\u591a\u4e2a\u9ad8\u65af\u6df7\u5408\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\uff1b\u63d0\u51fa\u9ad8\u65af\u7b97\u5b50\u8ff9\u548c\u6838\u8303\u6570\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8bad\u7ec3\u76ee\u6807\uff1b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7f16\u7801\u5668-\u6df7\u5408-\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u67b6\u6784\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u76ee\u6807\u7b49\u4ef7\u4e8e\u6700\u5927\u5316\u9ad8\u65af\u7b97\u5b50\u8ff9\uff1b\u63d0\u51fa\u4f7f\u7528\u6838\u8303\u6570\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6563\u5ea6\u8bad\u7ec3MDNs\uff1b\u65b0\u67b6\u6784\u80fd\u589e\u52a0\u6837\u672c\u591a\u6837\u6027\u5e76\u907f\u514d\u5e73\u51e1\u89e3\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9ad8\u65af\u7b97\u5b50\u8ff9\u548c\u6838\u8303\u6570\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u65b0\u89c6\u89d2\uff0c\u7f16\u7801\u5668-\u6df7\u5408-\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u67b6\u6784\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u5e76\u9632\u6b62\u8fc7\u62df\u5408\u3002"}}

This design introduces inherent bottlenecks, including redundant computations of identical users/items and increased latency due to strictly sequential operations, which jointly constrain the model's capacity and system efficiency. To address these limitations, we propose the Asynchronous Inference Framework (AIF), a cost-effective computational architecture that decouples interaction-independent components, those operating within a single user or item, from real-time prediction. AIF reorganizes the model inference process by performing user-side computations in parallel with the retrieval stage and conducting item-side computations in a nearline manner. This means that interaction-independent components are calculated just once and completed before the real-time prediction phase of the pre-ranking stage. As a result, AIF enhances computational efficiency and reduces latency, freeing up resources to significantly improve the feature set and model architecture of interaction-independent components. Moreover, we delve into model design within the AIF framework, employing approximated methods for interaction-dependent components in online real-time predictions. By co-designing both the framework and the model, our solution achieves notable performance gains without significantly increasing computational and latency costs.

To address these limitations, we propose Affine Prototype Timestamp (APT), a lightweight and flexible plug-in module that injects global distribution features into the normalization-forecasting pipeline. By leveraging timestamp conditioned prototype learning, APT dynamically generates affine parameters that modulate both input and output series, enabling the backbone to learn from self-supervised, distribution-aware clustered instances.

Magnetic field measurements of solar active regions are converted into structured multivariate time series, enabling predictive modeling across segmented observation windows. However, the inherently imbalanced nature of solar flare occurrences, where intense flares are rare compared to minor flare events, presents a significant barrier to effective learning. To address this challenge, we propose a novel Global Cross-Time Attention Fusion (GCTAF) architecture, a transformer-based model to enhance long-range temporal modeling. Unlike traditional self-attention mechanisms that rely solely on local interactions within time series, GCTAF injects a set of learnable cross-attentive global tokens that summarize salient temporal patterns across the entire sequence. These tokens are refined through cross-attention with the input sequence and fused back into the temporal representation, enabling the model to identify globally significant, non-contiguous time points that are critical for flare prediction. This mechanism functions as a dynamic attention-driven temporal summarizer that augments the model's capacity to capture discriminative flare-related dynamics. We evaluate our approach on the benchmark solar flare dataset and show that GCTAF effectively detects intense flares and improves predictive performance, demonstrating that refining transformer-based architectures presents a high-potential alternative for solar flare prediction tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8eTransformer\u7684GCTAF\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u4ea4\u53c9\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5168\u5c40\u4ee4\u724c\u6765\u589e\u5f3a\u957f\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u592a\u9633\u8000\u6591\u9884\u6d4b\u4e2d\u7684\u7c7b\u522b\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u592a\u9633\u8000\u6591\u4e8b\u4ef6\u5177\u6709\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u6027\uff0c\u5f3a\u70c8\u8000\u6591\u76f8\u5bf9\u7f55\u89c1\uff0c\u8fd9\u7ed9\u6709\u6548\u5b66\u4e60\u5e26\u6765\u4e86\u6311\u6218\u3002\u4f20\u7edf\u81ea\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u4ec5\u4f9d\u8d56\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u5185\u7684\u5c40\u90e8\u4ea4\u4e92\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u6355\u6349\u5bf9\u8000\u6591\u9884\u6d4b\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u5168\u5c40\u663e\u8457\u65f6\u95f4\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002", "method": "GCTAF\u67b6\u6784\u5f15\u5165\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u4ea4\u53c9\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5168\u5c40\u4ee4\u724c\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u4ee4\u724c\u901a\u8fc7\u4ea4\u53c9\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u4e0e\u8f93\u5165\u5e8f\u5217\u4ea4\u4e92\uff0c\u603b\u7ed3\u6574\u4e2a\u5e8f\u5217\u4e2d\u7684\u663e\u8457\u65f6\u95f4\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u878d\u5408\u56de\u65f6\u95f4\u8868\u793a\u4e2d\uff0c\u4f7f\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u591f\u8bc6\u522b\u5bf9\u8000\u6591\u9884\u6d4b\u5173\u952e\u7684\u5168\u5c40\u91cd\u8981\u975e\u8fde\u7eed\u65f6\u95f4\u70b9\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u57fa\u51c6\u592a\u9633\u8000\u6591\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u8868\u660e\uff0cGCTAF\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u68c0\u6d4b\u5f3a\u70c8\u8000\u6591\u5e76\u63d0\u9ad8\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6539\u8fdb\u57fa\u4e8eTransformer\u7684\u67b6\u6784\u4e3a\u592a\u9633\u8000\u6591\u9884\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u6f5c\u529b\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\uff0cGCTAF\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u9a71\u52a8\u65f6\u95f4\u603b\u7ed3\u673a\u5236\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u6355\u6349\u4e0e\u8000\u6591\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u5224\u522b\u6027\u52a8\u6001\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

However, the multi-stage pipeline (retrieve, generate) and unique workload characteristics (e.g., knowledge dependency) of RAG systems pose significant challenges for serving performance optimization. Existing generic LLM inference traces fail to capture these RAG-specific dynamics, creating a significant performance gap between academic research and real-world deployment. To bridge this gap, this paper introduces RAGPulse, an open-source RAG workload trace dataset. This dataset was collected from an university-wide Q&A system serving that has served more than 40,000 students and faculties since April 2024. We detail RAGPulse's system architecture, its privacy-preserving hash-based data format, and provide an in-depth statistical analysis. Our analysis reveals that real-world RAG workloads exhibit significant temporal locality and a highly skewed hot document access pattern. RAGPulse provides a high-fidelity foundation for researchers to develop and validate novel optimization strategies for RAG systems, such as content-aware batching and retrieval caching, ultimately enhancing the efficiency and reliability of RAG services.

Existing methods such as FGSM and PGD apply perturbations without regard to the underlying hyperbolic structure, potentially leading to inefficient or geometrically inconsistent attacks. In this work, we propose a novel adversarial attack that explicitly leverages the geometric properties of hyperbolic space. Specifically, we compute the gradient of the loss function in the tangent space of hyperbolic space, decompose it into a radial (depth) component and an angular (semantic) component, and apply perturbation derived solely from the angular direction. Our method generates adversarial examples by focusing perturbations in semantically sensitive directions encoded in angular movement within the hyperbolic geometry. Empirical results on image classification, cross-modal retrieval tasks and network architectures demonstrate that our attack achieves higher fooling rates than conventional adversarial attacks, while producing high-impact perturbations with deeper insights into vulnerabilities of hyperbolic embeddings.

Efficient Long-Range Message Passing with Fractal Nodes in MPNNs", "comment": "Accepted in AAAI 2026 for Oral Representation. This is the extended version including the appendix", "summary": "Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as powerful tools for learning on graph-structured data, but often struggle to balance local and global information. While graph Transformers aim to address this by enabling long-range interactions, they often overlook the inherent locality and efficiency of Message Passing Neural Networks (MPNNs). We propose a new concept called fractal nodes, inspired by the fractal structure observed in real-world networks. Our approach is based on the intuition that graph partitioning naturally induces fractal structure, where subgraphs often reflect the connectivity patterns of the full graph. Fractal nodes are designed to coexist with the original nodes and adaptively aggregate subgraph-level feature representations, thereby enforcing feature similarity within each subgraph. We show that fractal nodes alleviate the over-squashing problem by providing direct shortcut connections that enable long-range propagation of subgraph-level representations. Experiment results show that our method improves the expressive power of MPNNs and achieves comparable or better performance to graph Transformers while maintaining the computational efficiency of MPNN by improving the long-range dependencies of MPNN.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3a\u5206\u5f62\u8282\u70b9\u7684\u65b0\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u56fe\u5206\u5272\u4ea7\u751f\u7684\u5b50\u56fe\u4f5c\u4e3a\u7279\u6b8a\u8282\u70b9\u52a0\u5165\u539f\u56fe\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301MPNN\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u589e\u5f3a\u957f\u8ddd\u79bb\u4f9d\u8d56\u5efa\u6a21\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "GNN\u5728\u5e73\u8861\u5c40\u90e8\u548c\u5168\u5c40\u4fe1\u606f\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u56f0\u96be\uff0c\u56feTransformer\u867d\u7136\u80fd\u5904\u7406\u957f\u8ddd\u79bb\u4ea4\u4e92\u4f46\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86MPNN\u7684\u5c40\u90e8\u6027\u548c\u6548\u7387\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u73b0\u5b9e\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u89c2\u5bdf\u5230\u7684\u5206\u5f62\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u5206\u5f62\u8282\u70b9\u6982\u5ff5\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u56fe\u5206\u5272\u4ea7\u751f\u5b50\u56fe\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5206\u5f62\u8282\u70b9\uff0c\u4e0e\u539f\u8282\u70b9\u5171\u5b58\u5e76\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u805a\u5408\u5b50\u56fe\u7ea7\u7279\u5f81\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u5f3a\u5236\u5b50\u56fe\u5185\u7279\u5f81\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u7f13\u89e3\u4e86\u8fc7\u5ea6\u538b\u7f29\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u63d0\u4f9b\u76f4\u63a5\u6377\u5f84\u8fde\u63a5\u5b9e\u73b0\u5b50\u56fe\u7ea7\u8868\u793a\u7684\u957f\u8ddd\u79bb\u4f20\u64ad\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86MPNN\u7684\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4fdd\u6301MPNN\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4e0e\u56feTransformer\u76f8\u5f53\u6216\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u6539\u5584\u4e86MPNN\u7684\u957f\u8ddd\u79bb\u4f9d\u8d56\u5efa\u6a21\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

However, its application to network data, where causal heterogeneity is often graph-dependent, presents a critical challenge to its core assumption of a well-specified final-stage model. In this paper, we conduct a large-scale empirical study to systematically dissect the R-Learner framework on graphs. We provide the first rigorous evidence that the primary driver of performance is the inductive bias of the final-stage CATE estimator, an effect that dominates the choice of nuisance models. Our central finding is the quantification of a catastrophic \"representation bottleneck\": we prove with overwhelming statistical significance (p < 0.001) that R-Learners with a graph-blind final stage fail completely (MSE > 4.0), even when paired with powerful GNN nuisance models. Conversely, our proposed end-to-end Graph R-Learner succeeds and significantly outperforms a strong, non-DML GNN T-Learner baseline. Furthermore, we identify and provide a mechanistic explanation for a subtle, topology-dependent \"nuisance bottleneck,\" linking it to GNN over-squashing via a targeted \"Hub-Periphery Trade-off\" analysis.

While quantization has proven effective for LLMs, its applicability to SLMs is significantly underexplored, with critical questions about differing quantization bottlenecks and efficiency profiles. This paper introduces SLMQuant, the first systematic benchmark for evaluating LLM compression techniques when applied to SLMs. Through comprehensive multi-track evaluations across diverse architectures and tasks, we analyze how state-of-the-art quantization methods perform on SLMs. Our findings reveal fundamental disparities between SLMs and LLMs in quantization sensitivity, demonstrating that direct transfer of LLM-optimized techniques leads to suboptimal results due to SLMs' unique architectural characteristics and training dynamics. We identify key factors governing effective SLM quantization and propose actionable design principles for SLM-tailored compression. SLMQuant establishes a foundational framework for advancing efficient SLM deployment on low-end devices in edge applications, and provides critical insights for deploying lightweight language models in resource-constrained scenarios.", "AI": {"tldr": "SLMQuant\u662f\u9996\u4e2a\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30LLM\u538b\u7f29\u6280\u672f\u5728SLMs\u4e0a\u5e94\u7528\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86SLMs\u4e0eLLMs\u5728\u91cf\u5316\u654f\u611f\u6027\u4e0a\u7684\u6839\u672c\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u9488\u5bf9SLMs\u7684\u538b\u7f29\u8bbe\u8ba1\u539f\u5219\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u5c0f\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b(SLMs)\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8d44\u6e90\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\u53d7\u5230\u5173\u6ce8\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u8fb9\u7f18\u8bbe\u5907\u4e0a\u7684\u90e8\u7f72\u4ecd\u9762\u4e34\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3aLLM\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u91cf\u5316\u6280\u672f\u76f4\u63a5\u5e94\u7528\u4e8eSLMs\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u6b21\u4f18\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u8de8\u591a\u79cd\u67b6\u6784\u548c\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u7efc\u5408\u591a\u8f68\u9053\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u91cf\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728SLMs\u4e0a\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u5f71\u54cdSLM\u91cf\u5316\u6548\u679c\u7684\u5173\u952e\u56e0\u7d20\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0SLMs\u4e0eLLMs\u5728\u91cf\u5316\u654f\u611f\u6027\u4e0a\u5b58\u5728\u6839\u672c\u5dee\u5f02\uff0cSLMs\u72ec\u7279\u7684\u67b6\u6784\u7279\u5f81\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\u52a8\u6001\u5bfc\u81f4LLM\u4f18\u5316\u6280\u672f\u76f4\u63a5\u8fc1\u79fb\u6548\u679c\u4e0d\u4f73\u3002", "conclusion": "SLMQuant\u4e3a\u5728\u8fb9\u7f18\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u63a8\u8fdb\u9ad8\u6548SLM\u90e8\u7f72\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u57fa\u7840\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u90e8\u7f72\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5173\u952e\u89c1\u89e3\u3002"}}

While one-step Gaussian policies enable fast inference, they struggle to capture complex, multimodal action distributions. Existing flow-based methods improve expressivity but typically rely on distillation and two-stage training when trained with Q-learning. To overcome these limitations, we propose to reformulate MeanFlow to enable direct noise-to-action generation by integrating the velocity field and noise-to-action transformation into a single policy network-eliminating the need for separate velocity estimation. We explore several reformulation variants and identify an effective residual formulation that supports expressive and stable policy learning. Our method offers three key advantages: 1) efficient one-step noise-to-action generation, 2) expressive modelling of multimodal action distributions, and 3) efficient and stable policy learning via Q-learning in a single-stage training setup. Extensive experiments on 73 tasks across the OGBench and D4RL benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves strong performance in both offline and offline-to-online reinforcement learning settings.

To overcome this challenge, the research community is looking more and more at Graph Machine Learning (GML) as it offers a powerful alternative by using relationships within data. However, this method also faces limitations, particularly when dealing with Knowledge Graphs (KGs), which can hide huge information due to their semantic nature. This study introduces Bi-View, a novel hybrid approach that increases the informative content of node features in KGs to generate enhanced Graph Embeddings (GEs) that are used to improve GML models without relying on additional synthetic data. The proposed work combines two complementary GE techniques: Node2Vec, which captures structural patterns through unsupervised random walks, and GraphSAGE, which aggregates neighbourhood information in a supervised way. Node2Vec embeddings are first computed to represent the graph topology, and node features are then enriched with centrality-based metrics, which are used as input for the GraphSAGE model. Moreover, a fusion layer combines the original Node2Vec embeddings with the GraphSAGE-influenced representations, resulting in a dual-perspective embedding space. Such a fusion captures both topological and semantic properties of the graph, enabling the model to exploit informative features that may exist in the dataset but that are not explicitly represented. Our approach improves downstream task performance, especially in scenarios with poor initial features, giving the basis for more accurate and precise KG-enanched GML models.", "AI": {"tldr": "Bi-View\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408Node2Vec\u548cGraphSAGE\u4e24\u79cd\u56fe\u5d4c\u5165\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u4e2d\u8282\u70b9\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u91cf\uff0c\u5728\u4e0d\u4f9d\u8d56\u989d\u5916\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u63d0\u5347\u56fe\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u9700\u8981\u5927\u91cf\u6570\u636e\u624d\u80fd\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5728\u7a00\u758f\u6216\u4e0d\u5b8c\u6574\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u3002\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u7531\u4e8e\u5176\u8bed\u4e49\u7279\u6027\u53ef\u80fd\u9690\u85cf\u5927\u91cf\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u56fe\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5904\u7406\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u65f6\u9762\u4e34\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u7ed3\u5408\u4e24\u79cd\u4e92\u8865\u7684\u56fe\u5d4c\u5165\u6280\u672f\uff1aNode2Vec\uff08\u901a\u8fc7\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u968f\u673a\u6e38\u8d70\u6355\u6349\u7ed3\u6784\u6a21\u5f0f\uff09\u548cGraphSAGE\uff08\u4ee5\u76d1\u7763\u65b9\u5f0f\u805a\u5408\u90bb\u57df\u4fe1\u606f\uff09\u3002\u9996\u5148\u8ba1\u7b97Node2Vec\u5d4c\u5165\u8868\u793a\u56fe\u62d3\u6251\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e2d\u5fc3\u6027\u7684\u6307\u6807\u4e30\u5bcc\u8282\u70b9\u7279\u5f81\u4f5c\u4e3aGraphSAGE\u8f93\u5165\uff0c\u6700\u540e\u901a\u8fc7\u878d\u5408\u5c42\u7ed3\u5408\u539f\u59cbNode2Vec\u5d4c\u5165\u548cGraphSAGE\u5f71\u54cd\u7684\u8868\u793a\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u521d\u59cb\u7279\u5f81\u8f83\u5dee\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u4e3a\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u548c\u7cbe\u786e\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u589e\u5f3a\u56fe\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u5960\u5b9a\u4e86\u57fa\u7840\u3002", "conclusion": "Bi-View\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u6355\u6349\u56fe\u7684\u62d3\u6251\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u4f7f\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u591f\u5229\u7528\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u4f46\u672a\u660e\u786e\u8868\u793a\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u5728\u4e0d\u4f9d\u8d56\u989d\u5916\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u63d0\u5347\u56fe\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

We assume that a large amount $M$ of \\textit{unlabeled} data drawn from the sampling distribution $P$ is available, together with a small amount $N$ of labeled data drawn from the same distribution and noisy estimates of the corresponding ground truth entries. This setting is inspired by recommender systems scenarios where the unlabeled data corresponds to `implicit feedback' (consisting in interactions such as purchase, click, etc. ) and the labeled data corresponds to the `explicit feedback', consisting of interactions where the user has given an explicit rating to the item. Leveraging powerful results from the theory of low-rank subspace recovery, together with classic generalization bounds for matrix completion models, we show error bounds consisting of a sum of two error terms scaling as $\\widetilde{O}\\left(\\sqrt{\\frac{nd}{M}}\\right)$ and $\\widetilde{O}\\left(\\sqrt{\\frac{dr}{N}}\\right)$ respectively, where $d$ is the rank of $P$ and $r$ is the rank of $M$. In synthetic experiments, we confirm that the true generalization error naturally splits into independent error terms corresponding to the estimations of $P$ and and the ground truth matrix $\\ground$ respectively. In real-life experiments on Douban and MovieLens with most explicit ratings removed, we demonstrate that the method can outperform baselines relying only on the explicit ratings, demonstrating that our assumptions provide a valid toy theoretical setting to study the interaction between explicit and implicit feedbacks in recommender systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u77e9\u9635\u8865\u5168\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u771f\u5b9e\u77e9\u9635R\u548c\u672a\u77e5\u91c7\u6837\u5206\u5e03P\u90fd\u662f\u4f4e\u79e9\u77e9\u9635\u4e14\u5171\u4eab\u516c\u5171\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u3002\u5229\u7528\u5927\u91cf\u672a\u6807\u8bb0\u6570\u636e\uff08\u9690\u5f0f\u53cd\u9988\uff09\u548c\u5c11\u91cf\u6807\u8bb0\u6570\u636e\uff08\u663e\u5f0f\u53cd\u9988\uff09\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u7ed3\u5408\u4e24\u79cd\u53cd\u9988\u7684\u63a8\u8350\u7cfb\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u53d7\u63a8\u8350\u7cfb\u7edf\u573a\u666f\u542f\u53d1\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u672a\u6807\u8bb0\u6570\u636e\u5bf9\u5e94\u9690\u5f0f\u53cd\u9988\uff08\u5982\u70b9\u51fb\u3001\u8d2d\u4e70\uff09\uff0c\u6807\u8bb0\u6570\u636e\u5bf9\u5e94\u663e\u5f0f\u53cd\u9988\uff08\u7528\u6237\u8bc4\u5206\uff09\u3002\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u53ea\u4f7f\u7528\u4e00\u79cd\u53cd\u9988\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u63a2\u7d22\u5982\u4f55\u6709\u6548\u7ed3\u5408\u4e24\u79cd\u53cd\u9988\u7c7b\u578b\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u4f4e\u79e9\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u6062\u590d\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u77e9\u9635\u8865\u5168\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7ecf\u5178\u6cdb\u5316\u754c\u9650\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u8bef\u5dee\u754c\u5206\u6790\u6846\u67b6\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5927\u91cf\u672a\u6807\u8bb0\u6570\u636e\u4f30\u8ba1\u91c7\u6837\u5206\u5e03P\uff0c\u5c11\u91cf\u6807\u8bb0\u6570\u636e\u4f30\u8ba1\u771f\u5b9e\u77e9\u9635R\u3002", "result": "\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u5f97\u5230\u8bef\u5dee\u754c\u4e3a\u4e24\u9879\u4e4b\u548c\uff1aO(\u221a(nd/M))\u548cO(\u221a(dr/N))\uff0c\u5176\u4e2dd\u662fP\u7684\u79e9\uff0cr\u662fR\u7684\u79e9\u3002\u5728\u5408\u6210\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff08Douban\u3001MovieLens\uff09\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u663e\u5f0f\u8bc4\u5206\u7a00\u7f3a\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u4f18\u4e8e\u4ec5\u4f9d\u8d56\u663e\u5f0f\u53cd\u9988\u7684\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u6240\u63d0\u5047\u8bbe\u4e3a\u7814\u7a76\u63a8\u8350\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u663e\u5f0f\u548c\u9690\u5f0f\u53cd\u9988\u4ea4\u4e92\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u3002"}}

However, in typical scenarios where the fine-tuning data is limited, e.g., compared to pre-training, SFT can lead LMs to overfit, causing them to rely on spurious patterns within the target task or to compromise other broadly useful capabilities as a side effect of narrow specialization. In this paper, we propose Learning-from-the-Undesirable (LfU), a simple yet effective regularization scheme for SFT to mitigate overfitting issues when fine-tuning LMs with limited data. Specifically, we aim to regularize the fine-tuning process to favor solutions that are resilient to \"undesirable\" model updates, e.g., gradient ascent steps that steer the model toward undesirable behaviors. To this end, we propose a novel form of consistency regularization that directly aligns internal representations of the model with those after an undesirable update. By leveraging representation-level data augmentation through undesirable updates, LfU effectively promotes generalization under limited data. Our experiments on diverse LM downstream tasks show that LfU serves as an effective prior that enhances adaptability while preserving pretrained knowledge. For example, our LM from LfU achieves a 16.8% average improvement on math tasks compared to vanilla SFT on the same dataset, where the latter even leads to degraded performance on those tasks. Furthermore, LfU exhibits improved robustness to prompt variations, e.g., yielding a 92.1% lower standard deviation in output performances compared to SFT, highlighting its versatile effects.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86LfU\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u7528\u4e8e\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\u7684\u7b80\u5355\u6709\u6548\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u62b5\u6297\u4e0d\u826f\u6a21\u578b\u66f4\u65b0\u6765\u7f13\u89e3\u6709\u9650\u6570\u636e\u4e0b\u7684\u8fc7\u62df\u5408\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u6709\u9650\u6570\u636e\u4e0b\u8fdb\u884c\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\u65f6\uff0c\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5bb9\u6613\u8fc7\u62df\u5408\uff0c\u4f9d\u8d56\u865a\u5047\u6a21\u5f0f\u6216\u635f\u5bb3\u5176\u4ed6\u6709\u7528\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u63d0\u5347\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "LfU\u901a\u8fc7\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u6b63\u5219\u5316\uff0c\u76f4\u63a5\u5bf9\u9f50\u6a21\u578b\u5185\u90e8\u8868\u793a\u4e0e\u7ecf\u8fc7\u4e0d\u826f\u66f4\u65b0\u540e\u7684\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u8868\u793a\u7ea7\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u6765\u4fc3\u8fdb\u6cdb\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6570\u5b66\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u6bd4\u666e\u901aSFT\u5e73\u5747\u63d0\u534716.8%\uff0c\u8f93\u51fa\u6027\u80fd\u6807\u51c6\u5dee\u964d\u4f4e92.1%\uff0c\u663e\u793a\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "LfU\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6709\u6548\u5148\u9a8c\uff0c\u5728\u6709\u9650\u6570\u636e\u4e0b\u589e\u5f3a\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u5e7f\u6cdb\u9002\u7528\u6027\u3002"}}

We address this gap by conducting a geometric analysis of the network's energy landscape. We introduce a novel metric, ``Pinnacle Sharpness,'' to quantify the local stability of attractors. By systematically varying the kernel width and storage load, we uncover a rich phase diagram of attractor shapes. Our central finding is the emergence of a ``ridge of optimization,'' where the network maximizes attractor stability under challenging high-load and global-kernel conditions. Through a theoretical decomposition of the landscape gradient into a direct ``driving'' force and an indirect ``feedback'' force, we reveal the origin of this phenomenon. The optimization ridge corresponds to a regime of strong anti-correlation between the two forces, where the direct force, amplified by the high storage load, dominates the opposing collective feedback force. This demonstrates a sophisticated self-organization mechanism: the network adaptively harnesses inter-pattern interactions as a cooperative feedback control system to sculpt a robust energy landscape.

In many cases, well-established models such as GCN and GAT, when appropriately tuned, can match or even exceed the performance of more complex, state-of-the-art architectures. This trend highlights a key limitation in the current landscape: the difficulty of selecting the most suitable model for a given graph task or dataset. To address this, we propose Self-Adaptive Graph Mixture of Models (SAGMM), a modular and practical framework that learns to automatically select and combine the most appropriate GNN models from a diverse pool of architectures. Unlike prior mixture-of-experts approaches that rely on variations of a single base model, SAGMM leverages architectural diversity and a topology-aware attention gating mechanism to adaptively assign experts to each node based on the structure of the input graph. To improve efficiency, SAGMM includes a pruning mechanism that reduces the number of active experts during training and inference without compromising performance. We also explore a training-efficient variant in which expert models are pretrained and frozen, and only the gating and task-specific layers are trained. We evaluate SAGMM on 16 benchmark datasets covering node classification, graph classification, regression, and link prediction tasks, and demonstrate that it consistently outperforms or matches leading GNN baselines and prior mixture-based methods, offering a robust and adaptive solution for real-world graph learning.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86SAGMM\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u9009\u62e9\u548c\u7ec4\u5408\u4e0d\u540c\u7684GNN\u6a21\u578b\u6765\u63d0\u5347\u56fe\u5b66\u4e60\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u9009\u62e9\u56f0\u96be\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709GNN\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u8d8b\u4e8e\u9971\u548c\uff0c\u590d\u6742\u6a21\u578b\u5e76\u4e0d\u603b\u662f\u4f18\u4e8e\u7b80\u5355\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4e14\u96be\u4ee5\u9488\u5bf9\u4e0d\u540c\u56fe\u4efb\u52a1\u9009\u62e9\u5408\u9002\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u62d3\u6251\u611f\u77e5\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u95e8\u63a7\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u4ece\u591a\u6837\u5316\u6a21\u578b\u6c60\u4e2d\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5206\u914d\u4e13\u5bb6\u6a21\u578b\u7ed9\u6bcf\u4e2a\u8282\u70b9\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u526a\u679d\u673a\u5236\u63d0\u9ad8\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u5e76\u63a2\u7d22\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e13\u5bb6\u6a21\u578b\u53d8\u4f53\u3002", "result": "\u572816\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u6db5\u76d6\u8282\u70b9\u5206\u7c7b\u3001\u56fe\u5206\u7c7b\u3001\u56de\u5f52\u548c\u94fe\u63a5\u9884\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u59cb\u7ec8\u4f18\u4e8e\u6216\u5339\u914d\u9886\u5148\u7684GNN\u57fa\u7ebf\u548c\u73b0\u6709\u6df7\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "SAGMM\u4e3a\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u56fe\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9c81\u68d2\u4e14\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u81ea\u52a8\u9009\u62e9\u6700\u9002\u5408\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u7ec4\u5408\u3002"}}

While direct magnetic resonance imaging-guided biopsy demonstrates promising performance in detecting cancer lesions, its practical application is limited by prolonged procedure times and high costs. To overcome these issues, an indirect MRI-guided biopsy that allows the procedure to be performed outside of the MRI room has been proposed, but it still faces challenges in creating an accurate real-time deformable breast model. In our study, we tackled this issue by developing a graph neural network (GNN)-based model capable of accurately predicting deformed breast cancer sites in real time during biopsy procedures. An individual-specific finite element (FE) model was developed by incorporating magnetic resonance (MR) image-derived structural information of the breast and tumor to simulate deformation behaviors. A GNN model was then employed, designed to process surface displacement and distance-based graph data, enabling accurate prediction of overall tissue displacement, including the deformation of the tumor region. The model was validated using phantom and real patient datasets, achieving an accuracy within 0.2 millimeters (mm) for cancer node displacement (RMSE) and a dice similarity coefficient (DSC) of 0.977 for spatial overlap with actual cancerous regions. Additionally, the model enabled real-time inference and achieved a speed-up of over 4,000 times in computational cost compared to conventional FE simulations. The proposed deformation-aware GNN model offers a promising solution for real-time tumor displacement prediction in breast biopsy, with high accuracy and real-time capability. Its integration with clinical procedures could significantly enhance the precision and efficiency of breast cancer diagnosis.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5f00\u53d1\u57fa\u4e8e\u56fe\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u5b9e\u65f6\u4e73\u817a\u53d8\u5f62\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u63d0\u9ad8\u95f4\u63a5MRI\u5f15\u5bfc\u6d3b\u68c0\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e9a\u6beb\u7c73\u7ea7\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c4000\u500d\u8ba1\u7b97\u52a0\u901f\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u95f4\u63a5MRI\u5f15\u5bfc\u6d3b\u68c0\u4e2d\u5b9e\u65f6\u53d8\u5f62\u4e73\u817a\u6a21\u578b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0d\u8db3\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u514b\u670d\u76f4\u63a5MRI\u5f15\u5bfc\u6d3b\u68c0\u65f6\u95f4\u957f\u3001\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u7684\u9650\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u7ed3\u5408\u4e2a\u4f53\u7279\u5f02\u6027\u6709\u9650\u5143\u6a21\u578b\u548cGNN\uff0c\u5229\u7528MRI\u56fe\u50cf\u7ed3\u6784\u4fe1\u606f\u9884\u6d4b\u4e73\u817a\u7ec4\u7ec7\u53d8\u5f62\uff0c\u5904\u7406\u8868\u9762\u4f4d\u79fb\u548c\u8ddd\u79bb\u56fe\u6570\u636e\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6a21\u578b\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e2d\uff0c\u764c\u75c7\u8282\u70b9\u4f4d\u79fb\u8bef\u5dee\u5c0f\u4e8e0.2mm\uff0c\u4e0e\u5b9e\u9645\u764c\u533a\u7a7a\u95f4\u91cd\u53e0DSC\u8fbe0.977\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u901f\u5ea6\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edfFE\u6a21\u62df\u5feb4000\u500d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u53d8\u5f62\u611f\u77e5GNN\u6a21\u578b\u4e3a\u4e73\u817a\u6d3b\u68c0\u4e2d\u7684\u5b9e\u65f6\u80bf\u7624\u4f4d\u79fb\u9884\u6d4b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u5b9e\u65f6\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u6709\u671b\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e73\u817a\u764c\u8bca\u65ad\u7684\u7cbe\u786e\u6027\u548c\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}

First, they typically rely on assumptions leading to decay properties of local agent interactions, limiting their ability to capture long-range dependencies such as cascading power failures or epidemic outbreaks. Second, most approaches lack generalizability across network topologies, requiring retraining when applied to new graphs. We introduce STACCA (Shared Transformer Actor-Critic with Counterfactual Advantage), a unified transformer-based MARL framework that addresses both challenges. STACCA employs a centralized Graph Transformer Critic to model long-range dependencies and provide system-level feedback, while its shared Graph Transformer Actor learns a generalizable policy capable of adapting across diverse network structures. Further, to improve credit assignment during training, STACCA integrates a novel counterfactual advantage estimator that is compatible with state-value critic estimates. We evaluate STACCA on epidemic containment and rumor-spreading network control tasks, demonstrating improved performance, network generalization, and scalability. These results highlight the potential of transformer-based MARL architectures to achieve scalable and generalizable control in large-scale networked systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "STACCA\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8eTransformer\u7684\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u96c6\u4e2d\u5f0f\u56feTransformer\u8bc4\u8bba\u5bb6\u548c\u5171\u4eab\u56feTransformer\u6f14\u5458\u89e3\u51b3\u7f51\u7edc\u63a7\u5236\u4e2d\u7684\u957f\u7a0b\u4f9d\u8d56\u548c\u62d3\u6251\u6cdb\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u4f18\u52bf\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\u6539\u8fdb\u4fe1\u7528\u5206\u914d\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709MARL\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u4e3b\u8981\u5c40\u9650\uff1a1\uff09\u4f9d\u8d56\u5c40\u90e8\u4ea4\u4e92\u8870\u51cf\u5047\u8bbe\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u6355\u6349\u957f\u7a0b\u4f9d\u8d56\uff08\u5982\u7ea7\u8054\u7535\u529b\u6545\u969c\u3001\u75ab\u60c5\u7206\u53d1\uff09\uff1b2\uff09\u7f3a\u4e4f\u8de8\u7f51\u7edc\u62d3\u6251\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5728\u65b0\u56fe\u4e0a\u91cd\u65b0\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "method": "STACCA\u91c7\u7528\u96c6\u4e2d\u5f0f\u56feTransformer\u8bc4\u8bba\u5bb6\u5efa\u6a21\u957f\u7a0b\u4f9d\u8d56\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u7cfb\u7edf\u7ea7\u53cd\u9988\uff0c\u5171\u4eab\u56feTransformer\u6f14\u5458\u5b66\u4e60\u53ef\u6cdb\u5316\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5e76\u96c6\u6210\u4e0e\u72b6\u6001\u503c\u8bc4\u8bba\u5bb6\u4f30\u8ba1\u517c\u5bb9\u7684\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u4f18\u52bf\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\u6539\u8fdb\u4fe1\u7528\u5206\u914d\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u75ab\u60c5\u63a7\u5236\u548c\u8c23\u8a00\u4f20\u64ad\u7f51\u7edc\u63a7\u5236\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u8868\u660e\uff0cSTACCA\u5728\u6027\u80fd\u3001\u7f51\u7edc\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u5747\u6709\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "\u57fa\u4e8eTransformer\u7684MARL\u67b6\u6784\u6709\u6f5c\u529b\u5728\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u7f51\u7edc\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u548c\u53ef\u6cdb\u5316\u7684\u63a7\u5236\u3002"}}

We introduce GFOES, a novel framework comprising a Generative Feedback Network (GFN) and a two-phase fine-tuning procedure.

The two-phase fine-tuning procedure enables aggressive forgetting in the first phase, followed by utility restoration in the second. Experiments on three image classification datasets demonstrate that GFOES achieves effective forgetting at both logit and representation levels, while maintaining strong performance using only 5% of the original data.

However, a major bottleneck in this task is the unpaired nature of single-cell data, as the same cell cannot be observed both before and after perturbation due to the destructive nature of sequencing. Although some neural generative transport models attempt to tackle unpaired single-cell perturbation data, they either lack explicit conditioning or depend on prior spaces for indirect distribution alignment, limiting precise perturbation modeling. In this work, we approximate Schr\u00f6dinger Bridge (SB), which defines stochastic dynamic mappings recovering the entropy-regularized optimal transport (OT), to directly align the distributions of control and perturbed single-cell populations across different perturbation conditions. Unlike prior SB approximations that rely on bidirectional modeling to infer optimal source-target sample coupling, we leverage Minibatch-OT based pairing to avoid such bidirectional inference and the associated ill-posedness of defining the reverse process. This pairing directly guides bridge learning, yielding a scalable approximation to the SB. We approximate two SB models, one modeling discrete gene activation states and the other continuous expression distributions.

Existing masking-based methods attempt to mitigate such conflicts by assigning task-specific parameter masks. However, our empirical study shows that coarse-grained binary masks have the problem of over-suppressing key conflicting parameters, hindering knowledge sharing across tasks. Moreover, different tasks exhibit varying conflict levels, yet existing methods use a one-size-fits-all fixed sparsity strategy to keep training stability and performance, which proves inadequate. These limitations hinder the model's generalization and learning efficiency.\n  To address these issues, we propose SoCo-DT, a Soft Conflict-resolution method based by parameter importance. By leveraging Fisher information, mask values are dynamically adjusted to retain important parameters while suppressing conflicting ones. In addition, we introduce a dynamic sparsity adjustment strategy based on the Interquartile Range (IQR), which constructs task-specific thresholding schemes using the distribution of conflict and harmony scores during training. To enable adaptive sparsity evolution throughout training, we further incorporate an asymmetric cosine annealing schedule to continuously update the threshold.

To address communication costs while embracing data heterogeneity, we propose pFed1BS, a novel personalized federated learning framework that achieves extreme communication compression through one-bit random sketching. In personalized FL, the goal shifts from training a single global model to creating tailored models for each client. In our framework, clients transmit highly compressed one-bit sketches, and the server aggregates and broadcasts a global one-bit consensus. To enable effective personalization, we introduce a sign-based regularizer that guides local models to align with the global consensus while preserving local data characteristics. To mitigate the computational burden of random sketching, we employ the Fast Hadamard Transform for efficient projection. Theoretical analysis guarantees that our algorithm converges to a stationary neighborhood of the global potential function.

Despite this, conventional quantization suffers from its structural limitation that hinders flexibility during the fine-tuning and deployment stages. Practical on-device tasks demand different quantization precisions (i.e. different bit-widths), e.g., understanding tasks tend to exhibit higher tolerance to reduced precision compared to generation tasks. Conventional quantization, typically relying on scaling factors that are incompatible across bit-widths, fails to support the on-device switching of precisions when confronted with complex real-world scenarios. To overcome the dilemma, we propose OTARo, a novel method that enables on-device LLMs to flexibly switch quantization precisions while maintaining performance robustness through once fine-tuning. OTARo introduces Shared Exponent Floating Point (SEFP), a distinct quantization mechanism, to produce different bit-widths through simple mantissa truncations of a single model. Moreover, to achieve bit-width robustness in downstream applications, OTARo performs a learning process toward losses induced by different bit-widths. The method involves two critical strategies: (1) Exploitation-Exploration Bit-Width Path Search (BPS), which iteratively updates the search path via a designed scoring mechanism; (2) Low-Precision Asynchronous Accumulation (LAA), which performs asynchronous gradient accumulations and delayed updates under low bit-widths. Experiments on popular LLMs, e.g., LLaMA3.2-1B, LLaMA3-8B, demonstrate that OTARo achieves consistently strong and robust performance for all precisions.", "AI": {"tldr": "OTARo\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u91cf\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5141\u8bb8\u8bbe\u5907\u7aefLLM\u5728\u5355\u6b21\u5fae\u8c03\u540e\u7075\u6d3b\u5207\u6362\u91cf\u5316\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5171\u4eab\u6307\u6570\u6d6e\u70b9\u673a\u5236\u548c\u4f4d\u5bbd\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u5b66\u4e60\u5b9e\u73b0\u6027\u80fd\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u91cf\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u7ed3\u6784\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u652f\u6301\u8bbe\u5907\u7aef\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7075\u6d3b\u5207\u6362\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff08\u5982\u7406\u89e3\u4efb\u52a1\u548c\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u9700\u8981\u4e0d\u540c\u4f4d\u5bbd\uff09\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5b9e\u9645\u90e8\u7f72\u7684\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5171\u4eab\u6307\u6570\u6d6e\u70b9(SEFP)\u91cf\u5316\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u5c3e\u6570\u622a\u65ad\u751f\u6210\u4e0d\u540c\u4f4d\u5bbd\uff1b\u91c7\u7528\u4f4d\u5bbd\u8def\u5f84\u641c\u7d22(BPS)\u548c\u4f4e\u7cbe\u5ea6\u5f02\u6b65\u7d2f\u79ef(LAA)\u7b56\u7565\u8fdb\u884c\u4f4d\u5bbd\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u5b66\u4e60\u3002", "result": "\u5728LLaMA3.2-1B\u548cLLaMA3-8B\u7b49\u6d41\u884cLLM\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cOTARo\u5728\u6240\u6709\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0b\u90fd\u80fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e00\u81f4\u5f3a\u5927\u4e14\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "OTARo\u6210\u529f\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u91cf\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u8bbe\u5907\u7aef\u90e8\u7f72\u4e2d\u7684\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u4e3a\u590d\u6742\u73b0\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u7cbe\u5ea6\u5207\u6362\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

However, numerical simulation methods suffer from high computational cost, long run-times that prevent real-time use, while conventional Machine learning (ML) models struggle to extract spatiotemporal features for long-horizon prediction and fail to decouple thermo-mechanical fields. This paper proposes a Physics-informed Neural Operator (PINO) to predict z and y-direction distortion for the future 15 s. Our method, Physics-informed Deep Operator Network-Recurrent Neural Network (PIDeepONet-RNN) employs trunk and branch network to process temperature history and encode distortion fields, respectively, enabling decoupling of thermo-mechanical responses. By incorporating the heat conduction equation as a soft constraint, the model ensures physical consistency and suppresses unphysical artifacts, thereby establishing a more physically consistent mapping between the thermal history and distortion. This is important because such a basis function, grounded in physical laws, provides a robust and interpretable foundation for predictions. The proposed models are trained and tested using datasets generated from experimentally validated Finite Element Method (FEM). Evaluation shows that the model achieves high accuracy, low error accumulation, time efficiency. The max absolute errors in the z and y-directions are as low as 0.9733 mm and 0.2049 mm, respectively. The error distribution shows high errors in the molten pool but low gradient norms in the deposited and key areas. The performance of PINO surrogate model highlights its potential for real-time long-horizon physics field prediction in controlling defects.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7269\u7406\u4fe1\u606f\u795e\u7ecf\u7b97\u5b50(PINO)\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u91d1\u5c5e\u589e\u6750\u5236\u9020\u4e2d\u5b9e\u65f6\u9884\u6d4b\u672a\u676515\u79d2\u7684z\u548cy\u65b9\u5411\u53d8\u5f62\u573a\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u89e3\u8026\u70ed\u673a\u68b0\u54cd\u5e94\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u70ed\u4f20\u5bfc\u65b9\u7a0b\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8f6f\u7ea6\u675f\u6765\u786e\u4fdd\u7269\u7406\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u6570\u5b57\u5b6a\u751f\u548c\u667a\u80fd\u5236\u9020\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u8feb\u5207\u9700\u8981\u5b9e\u65f6\u53d8\u5f62\u573a\u9884\u6d4b\u6765\u63a7\u5236\u91d1\u5c5e\u589e\u6750\u5236\u9020\u7f3a\u9677\uff0c\u4f46\u6570\u503c\u6a21\u62df\u65b9\u6cd5\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u96be\u4ee5\u63d0\u53d6\u65f6\u7a7a\u7279\u5f81\u8fdb\u884c\u957f\u671f\u9884\u6d4b\u4e14\u65e0\u6cd5\u89e3\u8026\u70ed\u673a\u68b0\u573a\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u7269\u7406\u4fe1\u606f\u6df1\u5ea6\u7b97\u5b50\u7f51\u7edc-\u5faa\u73af\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc(PIDeepONet-RNN)\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e3b\u5e72\u548c\u5206\u652f\u7f51\u7edc\u5206\u522b\u5904\u7406\u6e29\u5ea6\u5386\u53f2\u548c\u7f16\u7801\u53d8\u5f62\u573a\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u70ed\u4f20\u5bfc\u65b9\u7a0b\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8f6f\u7ea6\u675f\u786e\u4fdd\u7269\u7406\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u6709\u9650\u5143\u6cd5\u751f\u6210\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8bad\u7ec3\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0cz\u548cy\u65b9\u5411\u6700\u5927\u7edd\u5bf9\u8bef\u5dee\u5206\u522b\u4e3a0.9733mm\u548c0.2049mm\uff0c\u8bef\u5dee\u7d2f\u79ef\u4f4e\uff0c\u65f6\u95f4\u6548\u7387\u9ad8\uff0c\u7194\u6c60\u533a\u57df\u8bef\u5dee\u8f83\u9ad8\u4f46\u6c89\u79ef\u548c\u5173\u952e\u533a\u57df\u68af\u5ea6\u8303\u6570\u4f4e\u3002", "conclusion": "PINO\u4ee3\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5b9e\u65f6\u957f\u671f\u7269\u7406\u573a\u9884\u6d4b\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u63a7\u5236\u7f3a\u9677\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u7269\u7406\u5b9a\u5f8b\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u51fd\u6570\u4e3a\u9884\u6d4b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7a33\u5065\u4e14\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

Deep learning methods have been employed to reconstruct the true Raman spectrum from measured CARS data using labeled datasets. A more recent development integrates the domain knowledge of Kramers-Kronig relationships and smoothness constraints in the form of physics-informed loss functions. However, these deterministic models lack the ability to quantify uncertainty, an essential feature for reliable deployment in high-stakes scientific and biomedical applications.

Project page: https://aku02.github.io/projects/difffp/", "summary": "Self-play reinforcement learning has demonstrated significant success in learning complex strategic and interactive behaviors in competitive multi-agent games. However, achieving such behaviors in continuous decision spaces remains challenging. Ensuring adaptability and generalization in self-play settings is critical for achieving competitive performance in dynamic multi-agent environments. These challenges often cause methods to converge slowly or fail to converge at all to a Nash equilibrium, making agents vulnerable to strategic exploitation by unseen opponents. To address these challenges, we propose DiffFP, a fictitious play (FP) framework that estimates the best response to unseen opponents while learning a robust and multimodal behavioral policy. Specifically, we approximate the best response using a diffusion policy that leverages generative modeling to learn adaptive and diverse strategies. Through empirical evaluation, we demonstrate that the proposed FP framework converges towards $\u03b5$-Nash equilibria in continuous- space zero-sum games. We validate our method on complex multi-agent environments, including racing and multi-particle zero-sum games.

To mitigate these issues, we propose ParaDySe, a novel adaptive Parallel strategy switching framework for Dynamic Sequences. ParaDySe enables on-the-fly optimal strategy adoption according to the immediate input sequence. It first implements the modular function libraries for parallel strategies with unified tensor layout specifications, and then builds sequence-aware memory and time cost models with hybrid methods. Guided by cost models, ParaDySe selects optimal layer-wise strategies for dynamic sequences via an efficient heuristic algorithm. By integrating these techniques together, ParaDySe achieves seamless hot-switching of optimal strategies through its well-designed function libraries.

However, these long CoTs result in increased token usage, leading to higher inference latency and memory consumption. As a result, balancing accuracy and reasoning efficiency has become essential for deploying reasoning LLMs in practical applications. Existing long-to-short (Long2Short) methods aim to reduce inference length but often sacrifice accuracy, revealing a need for an approach that maintains performance while lowering token costs. To address this efficiency-accuracy tradeoff, we propose TokenSqueeze, a novel Long2Short method that condenses reasoning paths while preserving performance and relying exclusively on self-generated data. First, to prevent performance degradation caused by excessive compression of reasoning depth, we propose to select self-generated samples whose reasoning depth is adaptively matched to the complexity of the problem. To further optimize the linguistic expression without altering the underlying reasoning paths, we introduce a distribution-aligned linguistic refinement method that enhances the clarity and conciseness of the reasoning path while preserving its logical integrity. Comprehensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of TokenSqueeze in reducing token usage while maintaining accuracy. Notably, DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B fine-tuned using our proposed method achieved a 50\\% average token reduction while preserving accuracy on the MATH500 benchmark. TokenSqueeze exclusively utilizes the model's self-generated data, enabling efficient and high-fidelity reasoning without relying on manually curated short-answer datasets across diverse applications.

This work introduces MorphBoost, a new gradient boosting framework featuring self-organizing tree structures that dynamically morph their splitting behavior during training. The algorithm implements adaptive split functions that evolve based on accumulated gradient statistics and iteration-dependent learning pressures, enabling automatic adjustment to problem complexity. Key innovations include: (1) morphing split criterion combining gradient-based scores with information-theoretic metrics weighted by training progress; (2) automatic problem fingerprinting for intelligent parameter configuration across binary/multiclass/regression tasks; (3) vectorized tree prediction achieving significant computational speedups; (4) interaction-aware feature importance detecting multiplicative relationships; and (5) fast-mode optimization balancing speed and accuracy. Comprehensive benchmarking across 10 diverse datasets against competitive models (XGBoost, LightGBM, GradientBoosting, HistGradientBoosting, ensemble methods) demonstrates that MorphBoost achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming XGBoost by 0.84% on average. MorphBoost secured the overall winner position with 4/10 dataset wins (40% win rate) and 6/30 top-3 finishes (20%), while maintaining the lowest variance (\u03c3=0.0948) and highest minimum accuracy across all models, revealing superior consistency and robustness.

Explainable AI (XAI) methods offer partial insights, yet often fall short of conveying the full decision space. Counterfactual Explanations (CE) provide a promising alternative, but current approaches typically prioritize either accuracy, proximity or sparsity -- rarely all -- limiting their practical value. To address this, we propose CONFETTI, a novel multi-objective CE method for MTS. CONFETTI identifies key MTS subsequences, locates a counterfactual target, and optimally modifies the time series to balance prediction confidence, proximity and sparsity. This method provides actionable insights with minimal changes, improving interpretability, and decision support. CONFETTI is evaluated on seven MTS datasets from the UEA archive, demonstrating its effectiveness in various domains.

These algorithms are widely used in political science, communication, computational social science, and computer science to estimate ideological preferences from parliamentary speeches, party manifestos, and social media. Over the past two decades, their development has closely followed broader NLP trends -- beginning with word-frequency models and most recently turning to large language models (LLMs). While this trajectory has greatly expanded the methodological toolkit, it has also produced a fragmented field that lacks systematic comparison and clear guidance for applied use. To address this gap, we identified 25 CT-IPE algorithms through a systematic literature review and conducted a manual content analysis of their modeling assumptions and development contexts. To compare them meaningfully, we introduce a conceptual framework that distinguishes how algorithms generate, capture, and aggregate textual variance. On this basis, we identify four methodological families -- word-frequency, topic modeling, word embedding, and LLM-based approaches -- and critically assess their assumptions, interpretability, scalability, and limitations. Our review offers three contributions. First, it provides a structured synthesis of two decades of algorithm development, clarifying how diverse methods relate to one another. Second, it translates these insights into practical guidance for applied researchers, highlighting trade-offs in transparency, technical requirements, and validation strategies that shape algorithm choice. Third, it emphasizes that differences in estimation outcomes across algorithms are themselves informative, underscoring the need for systematic benchmarking.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5bf9\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u548c\u534a\u76d1\u7763\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u6587\u672c\u7684\u7406\u60f3\u70b9\u4f30\u8ba1\u7b97\u6cd5\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u9996\u6b21\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u7efc\u8ff0\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u4ece\u8bcd\u9891\u6a21\u578b\u5230\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u5386\u7a0b\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u533a\u5206\u6587\u672c\u65b9\u5dee\u751f\u6210\u3001\u6355\u83b7\u548c\u805a\u5408\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u4e86\u56db\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bb6\u65cf\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u5e94\u7528\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u6307\u5bfc\u3002", "motivation": "\u586b\u8865\u6587\u672c\u7406\u60f3\u70b9\u4f30\u8ba1\u7b97\u6cd5\u9886\u57df\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u6bd4\u8f83\u548c\u660e\u786e\u5e94\u7528\u6307\u5bfc\u7684\u7a7a\u767d\u3002\u8be5\u9886\u57df\u5728\u8fc7\u53bb\u4e8c\u5341\u5e74\u4e2d\u968f\u7740NLP\u6280\u672f\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u800c\u5feb\u901f\u6f14\u8fdb\uff0c\u4f46\u5f62\u6210\u4e86\u788e\u7247\u5316\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u73b0\u72b6\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u6587\u732e\u7efc\u8ff0\u8bc6\u522b\u4e8625\u79cdCT-IPE\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u8fdb\u884c\u624b\u52a8\u5185\u5bb9\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u533a\u5206\u6587\u672c\u65b9\u5dee\u751f\u6210\u3001\u6355\u83b7\u548c\u805a\u5408\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u7b97\u6cd5\u5206\u4e3a\u8bcd\u9891\u3001\u4e3b\u9898\u5efa\u6a21\u3001\u8bcd\u5d4c\u5165\u548cLLM\u56db\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bb6\u65cf\u3002", "result": "\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u56db\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bb6\u65cf\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u5206\u7c7b\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u5404\u81ea\u7684\u5047\u8bbe\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u548c\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7b97\u6cd5\u9009\u62e9\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u6307\u5bfc\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u7b97\u6cd5\u4f30\u8ba1\u7ed3\u679c\u5dee\u5f02\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u4ef7\u503c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7efc\u8ff0\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u4e8c\u5341\u5e74\u7b97\u6cd5\u53d1\u5c55\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u7efc\u5408\uff0c\u4e3a\u5e94\u7528\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u900f\u660e\u6027\u3001\u6280\u672f\u8981\u6c42\u548c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7b56\u7565\u6743\u8861\u7684\u6307\u5bfc\uff0c\u5e76\u5f3a\u8c03\u9700\u8981\u7cfb\u7edf\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6765\u7406\u89e3\u7b97\u6cd5\u5dee\u5f02\u3002"}}

Such tasks can involve sequential interaction, requiring coherent updating of beliefs in light of new evidence, and making appropriate decisions based on those beliefs. Predicting how LLMs will perform in such dynamic environments is important, but can be tricky to determine from measurements in static settings. In this work, we examine two critical components of LLM performance: the ability of LLMs to coherently update their beliefs, and the extent to which the actions they take are consistent with those beliefs. First, we find that LLMs are largely inconsistent in how they update their beliefs; models can exhibit up to a 30% average difference between the directly elicited posterior, and the correct update of their prior. Second, we find that LLMs also often take actions which are inconsistent with the beliefs they hold. On a betting market, for example, LLMs often do not even bet in the same direction as their internally held beliefs over the underlying outcomes.

We introduce De-VQA, a dynamic evaluation for visual question answering, uncovering a phenomenon we term transient blindness, overfitting to edit-similar text while ignoring visuals. Token analysis shows edits disproportionately affect textual tokens. We propose locality-aware adversarial losses to balance cross-modal representations.

Most predictors of experimental observables are non-differentiable, making them incompatible with gradient-based conditional sampling. This is especially limiting in nuclear magnetic resonance, where rich data such as chemical shifts are hard to directly integrate into generative modeling. We introduce a framework for non-differentiable guidance of protein generative models, coupling a continuous diffusion-based generator with any black-box objective via a tailored genetic algorithm. We demonstrate its effectiveness across three modalities: pairwise distance constraints, nuclear Overhauser effect restraints, and for the first time chemical shifts. These results establish chemical shift guided structure generation as feasible, expose key weaknesses in current predictors, and showcase a general strategy for incorporating diverse experimental signals.

Code and artifacts: https://github.com/SV25-22/ECHO-Proteins", "summary": "We present reproducible, edge-aware baselines for ogbn-proteins in PyTorch Geometric (PyG). We study two system choices that dominate practice: (i) how 8-dimensional edge evidence is aggregated into node inputs, and (ii) how edges are used inside message passing. Our strongest baseline is GraphSAGE with sum-based edge-to-node features. We compare LayerNorm (LN), BatchNorm (BN), and a species-aware Conditional LayerNorm (CLN), and report compute cost (time, VRAM, parameters) together with accuracy (ROC-AUC) and decision quality. In our primary experimental setup (hidden size 512, 3 layers, 3 seeds), sum consistently beats mean and max; BN attains the best AUC, while CLN matches the AUC frontier with better thresholded F1. Finally, post-hoc per-label temperature scaling plus per-label thresholds substantially improves micro-F1 and expected calibration error (ECE) with negligible AUC change, and light label-correlation smoothing yields small additional gains.

However, deep RL algorithms train a deep neural network, that lacks transparency, which poses challenges when the controller has to meet regulations, or foster trust. To alleviate this, one could transfer the learned behaviour into a model that is human-readable by design using knowledge distilla- tion. Often this is done with a single model which mimics the original model on average but could struggle in more dynamic situations. A key challenge is that this simpler model should have the right balance be- tween flexibility and complexity or right balance between balance bias and accuracy. We propose a new model-agnostic method to divide the state space into regions where a simplified, human-understandable model can operate in. In this paper, we use Voronoi partitioning to find regions where linear models can achieve similar performance to the original con- troller. We evaluate our approach on a gridworld environment and a classic control task. We observe that our proposed distillation to locally- specialized linear models produces policies that are explainable and show that the distillation matches or even slightly outperforms the black-box policy they are distilled from.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8eVoronoi\u5206\u5272\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u5173\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c06\u6df1\u5ea6\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u7684\u72b6\u6001\u7a7a\u95f4\u5212\u5206\u4e3a\u591a\u4e2a\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u5728\u6bcf\u4e2a\u533a\u57df\u4f7f\u7528\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u7ebf\u6027\u6a21\u578b\u6765\u8fd1\u4f3c\u539f\u59cb\u9ed1\u76d2\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "motivation": "\u6df1\u5ea6\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u7f3a\u4e4f\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u6ee1\u8db3\u76d1\u7ba1\u8981\u6c42\u548c\u5efa\u7acb\u4fe1\u4efb\u3002\u9700\u8981\u5c06\u5b66\u4e60\u5230\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u8f6c\u79fb\u5230\u4eba\u7c7b\u53ef\u8bfb\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\uff0c\u4f46\u5355\u4e00\u7b80\u5316\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5728\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u548c\u590d\u6742\u6027\u4e4b\u95f4\u627e\u5230\u5e73\u8861\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528Voronoi\u5206\u5272\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c06\u72b6\u6001\u7a7a\u95f4\u5212\u5206\u4e3a\u591a\u4e2a\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u5728\u6bcf\u4e2a\u533a\u57df\u5185\u4f7f\u7528\u7ebf\u6027\u6a21\u578b\u6765\u8fd1\u4f3c\u539f\u59cb\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5c40\u90e8\u4e13\u4e1a\u5316\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u84b8\u998f\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u7f51\u683c\u4e16\u754c\u73af\u5883\u548c\u7ecf\u5178\u63a7\u5236\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ea7\u751f\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u5177\u6709\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u84b8\u998f\u540e\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u539f\u59cb\u9ed1\u76d2\u7b56\u7565\u76f8\u5f53\u751a\u81f3\u7565\u6709\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u5c40\u90e8\u4e13\u4e1a\u5316\u7ebf\u6027\u6a21\u578b\u84b8\u998f\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u751f\u6210\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u6df1\u5ea6\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u7684\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

Unlike vision and language tasks, where models can exploit inductive biases in the data, tabular data lacks inherent positional structure, hindering the effectiveness of self-attention mechanisms. While recent transformer-based models like TabTransformer, SAINT, and FT-Transformer (which we refer to as 3T) have shown promise on tabular data, they typically operate without leveraging structural cues such as positional encodings (PEs), as no prior structural information is usually available. In this work, we find both theoretically and empirically that structural cues, specifically PEs can be a useful tool to improve generalization performance for tabular transformers. We find that PEs impart the ability to reduce the effective rank (a form of intrinsic dimensionality) of the features, effectively simplifying the task by reducing the dimensionality of the problem, yielding improved generalization. To that end, we propose Tab-PET (PEs for Tabular Transformers), a graph-based framework for estimating and inculcating PEs into embeddings. Inspired by approaches that derive PEs from graph topology, we explore two paradigms for graph estimation: association-based and causality-based. We empirically demonstrate that graph-derived PEs significantly improve performance across 50 classification and regression datasets for 3T. Notably, association-based graphs consistently yield more stable and pronounced gains compared to causality-driven ones. Our work highlights an unexpected role of PEs in tabular transformers, revealing how they can be harnessed to improve generalization.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51faTab-PET\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u56fe\u7ed3\u6784\u4f30\u8ba1\u4f4d\u7f6e\u7f16\u7801\u6765\u63d0\u5347\u8868\u683c\u6570\u636e\u4e0aTransformer\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u4f4d\u7f6e\u7f16\u7801\u80fd\u964d\u4f4e\u7279\u5f81\u6709\u6548\u79e9\u4ece\u800c\u7b80\u5316\u4efb\u52a1\u3002", "motivation": "\u8868\u683c\u6570\u636e\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7ed3\u6784\u7ebf\u7d22\u548c\u4f4d\u7f6e\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u4f20\u7edfTransformer\u6a21\u578b\u96be\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u5229\u7528\u81ea\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u8868\u683cTransformer\u6a21\u578b\u901a\u5e38\u4e0d\u4f7f\u7528\u4f4d\u7f6e\u7f16\u7801\uff0c\u4f46\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u4f4d\u7f6e\u7f16\u7801\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faTab-PET\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u56fe\u7ed3\u6784\u4f30\u8ba1\u4f4d\u7f6e\u7f16\u7801\u3002\u63a2\u7d22\u4e24\u79cd\u56fe\u4f30\u8ba1\u8303\u5f0f\uff1a\u57fa\u4e8e\u5173\u8054\u6027\u7684\u56fe\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u56e0\u679c\u5173\u7cfb\u7684\u56fe\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u4f4d\u7f6e\u7f16\u7801\u878d\u5165\u8868\u683cTransformer\u7684\u5d4c\u5165\u4e2d\u3002", "result": "\u572850\u4e2a\u5206\u7c7b\u548c\u56de\u5f52\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u56fe\u63a8\u5bfc\u7684\u4f4d\u7f6e\u7f16\u7801\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e863T\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u57fa\u4e8e\u5173\u8054\u6027\u7684\u56fe\u6bd4\u56e0\u679c\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u83b7\u5f97\u66f4\u7a33\u5b9a\u548c\u663e\u8457\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4f4d\u7f6e\u7f16\u7801\u5728\u8868\u683cTransformer\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u610f\u5916\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u901a\u8fc7\u964d\u4f4e\u7279\u5f81\u6709\u6548\u79e9\u6765\u6539\u5584\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4e3a\u8868\u683c\u6570\u636e\u5efa\u6a21\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u89c6\u89d2\u3002"}}

Their internal distributions remain largely unobservable and are typically inferred from surface-exposed discontinuities using generative prediction approaches. However, surface-exposed observations are inherently sparse, and existing generative prediction approaches either fail to capture the underlying complex distribution patterns or lack robustness under data-sparse conditions. Here, we proposed a simple yet robust approach for statistically accurate generative prediction of rock discontinuities by utilizing a tabular foundation model. By leveraging the powerful sample learning capability of the foundation model specifically designed for small data, our approach can effectively capture the underlying complex distribution patterns within limited measured discontinuities. Comparative experiments on ten datasets with diverse scales and distribution patterns of discontinuities demonstrate superior accuracy and robustness over conventional statistical models and deep generative approaches.

This problem represents the local analogue of Hilbert's 18th problem on sphere packing, bridging geometry, number theory, and information theory. Although significant progress has been made through lattices and codes, the irregularities of high-dimensional geometry and exponentially growing combinatorial complexity beyond 8 dimensions, which exceeds the complexity of Go game, limit the scalability of existing methods. Here we model this problem as a two-player matrix completion game and train the game-theoretic reinforcement learning system, PackingStar, to efficiently explore high-dimensional spaces. The matrix entries represent pairwise cosines of sphere center vectors; one player fills entries while another corrects suboptimal ones, jointly maximizing the matrix size, corresponding to the kissing number. This cooperative dynamics substantially improves sample quality, making the extremely large spaces tractable. PackingStar reproduces previous configurations and surpasses all human-known records from dimensions 25 to 31, with the configuration in 25 dimensions geometrically corresponding to the Leech lattice and suggesting possible optimality. It achieves the first breakthrough beyond rational structures from 1971 in 13 dimensions and discovers over 6000 new structures in 14 and other dimensions.

Gradient-based methods are then applied to efficiently navigate toward high-density posterior regions and avoid wasteful simulations in low-probability areas. A JAX-based implementation further enhances the performance through vectorization of key method components. Extensive experiments, including high-dimensional parameter spaces, uninformative outputs, multiple observations and multimodal posteriors show that our method consistently matches, and often exceeds, the accuracy of state-of-the-art approaches, while reducing the runtime by a substantial margin.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9488\u5bf9\u53ef\u5fae\u5206\u6a21\u62df\u5668\u7684\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u53c2\u6570\u63a8\u65ad\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u968f\u673a\u6a21\u62df\u91cd\u65b0\u8868\u8ff0\u4e3a\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u68af\u5ea6\u65b9\u6cd5\u9ad8\u6548\u5bfc\u822a\u81f3\u9ad8\u5bc6\u5ea6\u540e\u9a8c\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u5927\u5e45\u51cf\u5c11\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\u3002", "motivation": "\u590d\u6742\u968f\u673a\u6a21\u62df\u5668\u7684\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u53c2\u6570\u63a8\u65ad\u9762\u4e34\u4f3c\u7136\u51fd\u6570\u96be\u4ee5\u5904\u7406\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u6a21\u62df\u7684\u63a8\u65ad\u65b9\u6cd5\u9700\u8981\u5927\u91cf\u6a21\u62df\uff0c\u5728\u9ad8\u7ef4\u53c2\u6570\u7a7a\u95f4\u6216\u90e8\u5206\u65e0\u4fe1\u606f\u8f93\u51fa\u95ee\u9898\u4e2d\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u6602\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u4f18\u5316\u8499\u7279\u5361\u6d1b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u968f\u673a\u6a21\u62df\u91cd\u65b0\u8868\u8ff0\u4e3a\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e94\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u68af\u5ea6\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u9ad8\u6548\u5bfc\u822a\u81f3\u9ad8\u5bc6\u5ea6\u540e\u9a8c\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u5728\u4f4e\u6982\u7387\u533a\u57df\u8fdb\u884c\u6d6a\u8d39\u6027\u6a21\u62df\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7JAX\u5b9e\u73b0\u5173\u952e\u7ec4\u4ef6\u7684\u5411\u91cf\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u9ad8\u7ef4\u53c2\u6570\u7a7a\u95f4\u3001\u65e0\u4fe1\u606f\u8f93\u51fa\u3001\u591a\u89c2\u6d4b\u548c\u591a\u5cf0\u540e\u9a8c\u7b49\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u59cb\u7ec8\u5339\u914d\u5e76\u7ecf\u5e38\u8d85\u8d8a\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5927\u5e45\u51cf\u5c11\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u53ef\u5fae\u5206\u6a21\u62df\u5668\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u53c2\u6570\u63a8\u65ad\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}

Existing models often focus on disentangling and separately modeling spatial and temporal patterns based on relationships between data points. However, these approaches struggle to adapt to the random missing positions, and fail to learn long-term and large-scale dependencies, which are essential in extensive missing conditions. In this paper, patterns are categorized into two types to handle various missing data conditions: primary patterns, which originate from internal relationships between data points, and auxiliary patterns, influenced by external factors like timestamps and node attributes. Accordingly, we propose the Primary-Auxiliary Spatio-Temporal network (PAST). It comprises a graph-integrated module (GIM) and a cross-gated module (CGM). GIM captures primary patterns via dynamic graphs with interval-aware dropout and multi-order convolutions, and CGM extracts auxiliary patterns through bidirectional gating on embedded external features. The two modules interact via shared hidden vectors and are trained under an ensemble self-supervised framework.

This paper presents a theoretical analysis of how a common workaround, training for multiple epochs on the same dataset, reshapes the data scaling laws in linear regression. Concretely, we ask: to match the performance of training on a dataset of size $N$ for $K$ epochs, how much larger must a dataset be if the model is trained for only one pass? We quantify this using the \\textit{effective reuse rate} of the data, $E(K, N)$, which we define as the multiplicative factor by which the dataset must grow under one-pass training to achieve the same test loss as $K$-epoch training. Our analysis precisely characterizes the scaling behavior of $E(K, N)$ for SGD in linear regression under either strong convexity or Zipf-distributed data: (1) When $K$ is small, we prove that $E(K, N) \\approx K$, indicating that every new epoch yields a linear gain; (2) As $K$ increases, $E(K, N)$ plateaus at a problem-dependent value that grows with $N$ ($\u0398(\\log N)$ for the strongly-convex case), implying that larger datasets can be repeated more times before the marginal benefit vanishes. These theoretical findings point out a neglected factor in a recent empirical study (Muennighoff et al. (2023)), which claimed that training LLMs for up to $4$ epochs results in negligible loss differences compared to using fresh data at each step, \\textit{i.e.}, $E(K, N) \\approx K$ for $K \\le 4$ in our notation. Supported by further empirical validation with LLMs, our results reveal that the maximum $K$ value for which $E(K, N) \\approx K$ in fact depends on the data size and distribution, and underscore the need to explicitly model both factors in future studies of scaling laws with data reuse.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u5728\u6709\u9650\u6570\u636e\u548c\u591a\u6b21\u8bad\u7ec3\u5468\u671f\u4e0b\uff0c\u6570\u636e\u7f29\u653e\u5b9a\u5f8b\u7684\u53d8\u5316\u5f62\u5f0f\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9a\u4e49\"\u6709\u6548\u91cd\u7528\u7387\"E(K,N)\uff0c\u91cf\u5316\u4e86K\u6b21\u8bad\u7ec3\u5468\u671f\u4e0e\u5355\u6b21\u8bad\u7ec3\u6240\u9700\u6570\u636e\u91cf\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u6570\u636e\u91cd\u7528\u5bf9\u7f29\u653e\u5b9a\u5f8b\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u8bed\u6599\u5e93\u5355\u6b21\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u6570\u636e\u7f29\u653e\u5b9a\u5f8b\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u6709\u9650\u6570\u636e\u548c\u591a\u6b21\u8bad\u7ec3\u5468\u671f\u4e0b\u7684\u7f29\u653e\u5b9a\u5f8b\u5f62\u5f0f\u4ecd\u4e0d\u660e\u786e\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u586b\u8865\u8fd9\u4e00\u7a7a\u767d\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u5173\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u91cd\u590d\u4f7f\u7528\u5bf9\u7f29\u653e\u5b9a\u5f8b\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u5728\u7ebf\u6027\u56de\u5f52\u6846\u67b6\u4e0b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u7814\u7a76SGD\u5728\u5f3a\u51f8\u6027\u6216Zipf\u5206\u5e03\u6570\u636e\u4e0b\u7684\u7f29\u653e\u884c\u4e3a\u3002\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u91cd\u7528\u7387E(K,N)\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6838\u5fc3\u5206\u6790\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7LLM\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u8bc1\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\uff1a(1)\u5f53K\u8f83\u5c0f\u65f6\uff0cE(K,N)\u2248K\uff0c\u6bcf\u6b21\u65b0\u8bad\u7ec3\u5468\u671f\u5e26\u6765\u7ebf\u6027\u589e\u76ca\uff1b(2)\u968f\u7740K\u589e\u52a0\uff0cE(K,N)\u8d8b\u4e8e\u5e73\u53f0\u671f\uff0c\u8be5\u5e73\u53f0\u503c\u968fN\u589e\u957f(\u5f3a\u51f8\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u4e3a\u0398(log N))\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u5927\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u53ef\u4ee5\u91cd\u590d\u66f4\u591a\u6b21\u800c\u8fb9\u9645\u6548\u76ca\u4e0d\u6d88\u5931\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6570\u636e\u91cd\u7528\u7684\u6700\u5927\u6709\u6548\u6b21\u6570\u53d6\u51b3\u4e8e\u6570\u636e\u89c4\u6a21\u548c\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e00\u53d1\u73b0\u4fee\u6b63\u4e86\u5148\u524d\u5b9e\u8bc1\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u7ed3\u8bba\uff0c\u5e76\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u5728\u672a\u6765\u7f29\u653e\u5b9a\u5f8b\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u9700\u8981\u660e\u786e\u5efa\u6a21\u8fd9\u4e24\u4e2a\u56e0\u7d20\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002"}}

Existing clustering techniques either rely on fixed distance metrics or deep models designed for static data, limiting their ability to handle dynamic, unstructured industrial sequences. Addressing this gap, this paper proposes a novel framework for unsupervised discovery of operational modes in univariate time-series data using image-based convolutional clustering with composite internal evaluation. The proposed framework improves upon existing approaches in three ways: (1) raw time-series sequences are transformed into grayscale matrix representations via overlapping sliding windows, allowing effective feature extraction using a deep convolutional autoencoder; (2) the framework integrates both soft and hard clustering outputs and refines the selection through a two-stage strategy; and (3) clustering performance is objectively evaluated by a newly developed composite score, S_eva, which combines normalized Silhouette, Calinski-Harabasz, and Davies-Bouldin indices. Applied to over 3900 furnace melting operations from a Nordic foundry, the method identifies seven explainable operational patterns, revealing significant differences in energy consumption, thermal dynamics, and production duration. Compared to classical and deep clustering baselines, the proposed approach achieves superior overall performance, greater robustness, and domain-aligned explainability. The framework addresses key challenges in unsupervised time-series analysis, such as sequence irregularity, overlapping modes, and metric inconsistency, and provides a generalizable solution for data-driven diagnostics and energy optimization in industrial systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u56fe\u50cf\u5377\u79ef\u805a\u7c7b\u7684\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u5de5\u4e1a\u65f6\u5e8f\u6570\u636e\u5206\u6790\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u53d1\u73b0\u64cd\u4f5c\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u5728\u7194\u7089\u64cd\u4f5c\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u8bc6\u522b\u51fa7\u79cd\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u8fd0\u884c\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002", "motivation": "\u5de5\u4e1a\u8fc7\u7a0b\u76d1\u63a7\u4f9d\u8d56\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u65f6\u5e8f\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u6807\u7b7e\u3001\u9ad8\u53d8\u5f02\u6027\u548c\u64cd\u4f5c\u566a\u58f0\u4f7f\u5f97\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u63d0\u53d6\u6709\u6548\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u805a\u7c7b\u65b9\u6cd5\u65e0\u6cd5\u5904\u7406\u52a8\u6001\u3001\u975e\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u7684\u5de5\u4e1a\u5e8f\u5217\u6570\u636e\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u539f\u59cb\u65f6\u5e8f\u6570\u636e\u901a\u8fc7\u6ed1\u52a8\u7a97\u53e3\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u7070\u5ea6\u77e9\u9635\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u6df1\u5ea6\u5377\u79ef\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u8fdb\u884c\u7279\u5f81\u63d0\u53d6\uff0c\u96c6\u6210\u8f6f\u786c\u805a\u7c7b\u8f93\u51fa\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u7b56\u7565\u4f18\u5316\u9009\u62e9\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u65b0\u5f00\u53d1\u7684\u590d\u5408\u8bc4\u5206S_eva\u8bc4\u4f30\u805a\u7c7b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "result": "\u57283900\u591a\u4e2a\u7194\u7089\u64cd\u4f5c\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u8bc6\u522b\u51fa7\u79cd\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u64cd\u4f5c\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u80fd\u8017\u3001\u70ed\u529b\u5b66\u7279\u6027\u548c\u751f\u4ea7\u65f6\u957f\u7684\u663e\u8457\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u548c\u6df1\u5ea6\u805a\u7c7b\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u4f18\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u65f6\u5e8f\u5206\u6790\u4e2d\u7684\u5e8f\u5217\u4e0d\u89c4\u5219\u6027\u3001\u6a21\u5f0f\u91cd\u53e0\u548c\u5ea6\u91cf\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u7b49\u5173\u952e\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u4e3a\u5de5\u4e1a\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u8bca\u65ad\u548c\u80fd\u6e90\u4f18\u5316\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u901a\u7528\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Lung disease often causes increased right ventricular load, leading to RHF. Therefore, it is very important to screen out patients with cor pulmonale who develop RHF from people with underlying lung diseases. In this work, we propose a self-supervised representation learning method to early detecting RHF from patients with cor pulmonale, which uses spirogram time series to predict patients with RHF at an early stage. The proposed model is divided into two stages. The first stage is the self-supervised representation learning-based spirogram embedding (SLSE) network training process, where the encoder of the Variational autoencoder (VAE-encoder) learns a robust low-dimensional representation of the spirogram time series from the data-augmented unlabeled data. Second, this low-dimensional representation is fused with demographic information and fed into a CatBoost classifier for the downstream RHF prediction task. Trained and tested on a carefully selected subset of 26,617 individuals from the UK Biobank, our model achieved an AUROC of 0.7501 in detecting RHF, demonstrating strong population-level distinction ability. We further evaluated the model on high-risk clinical subgroups, achieving AUROC values of 0.8194 on a test set of 74 patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and 0.8413 on a set of 64 patients with valvular heart disease (VHD). These results highlight the model's potential utility in predicting RHF among clinically elevated-risk populations.

However, SR faces two main challenges: most methods are evaluated on scientific datasets with well-understood relationships, limiting generalization, and SR primarily targets single-output regression, whereas many real-world problems involve multi-target outputs with interdependent variables. To address these issues, we propose multi-task regression GINN-LP (MTRGINN-LP), an interpretable neural network for multi-target symbolic regression.

Under the training framework, the optimization algorithm aims to stably converge high-dimensional optimization to local and even global minima. Entering the era of large language models, although the scale of model parameters and data has increased, Adam remains the mainstream optimization algorithm. However, compared with stochastic gradient descent (SGD) based optimization algorithms, Adam is more likely to converge to non-flat minima. To address this issue, the AdamX algorithm is proposed. Its core innovation lies in the proposition of a novel type of second-order moment estimation exponential decay rate, which gradually weakens the learning step correction strength as training progresses, and degrades to SGD in the stable training period, thereby improving the stability of training in the stable period and possibly enhancing generalization ability. Experimental results show that our second-order moment estimation exponential decay rate is better than the current second-order moment estimation exponential decay rate, and AdamX can stably outperform Adam and its variants in terms of performance.

This challenge is compounded by spatial heterogeneity, causing models to learn spurious patterns that fit only local data. Unlike conventional domain generalization, environmental modeling must preserve invariant physical relationships and temporal coherence during augmentation. In this paper, we introduce Generalizable Representation Enhancement via Auxiliary Transformations (GREAT), a framework that effectively augments available datasets to improve predictions in completely unseen regions. GREAT guides the augmentation process to ensure that the original governing processes can be recovered from the augmented data, and the inclusion of the augmented data leads to improved model generalization. Specifically, GREAT learns transformation functions at multiple layers of neural networks to augment both raw environmental features and temporal influence. They are refined through a novel bi-level training process that constrains augmented data to preserve key patterns of the original source data. We demonstrate GREAT's effectiveness on stream temperature prediction across six ecologically diverse watersheds in the eastern U.S., each containing multiple stream segments.

Similar to classical machine learning, QML models also face challenges arising from the scarcity of labeled data, particularly as their scale and complexity increase. Here, we introduce self-supervised pretraining of quantum representations that reduces reliance on labeled data by learning invariances from unlabeled examples. We implement this paradigm on a programmable trapped-ion quantum computer, encoding images as quantum states. In situ contrastive pretraining on hardware yields a representation that, when fine-tuned, classifies image families with higher mean test accuracy and lower run-to-run variability than models trained from random initialization. Performance improvement is especially significant in regimes with limited labeled training data. We show that the learned invariances generalize beyond the pretraining image samples.

The proposed method introduces a bidirectional representation for time series by jointly processing forward and time-reversed input sequences. These representations are then combined through an element-wise (Hadamard) interaction, resulting in a Vedic-inspired encoding that enhances the model's ability to capture temporal dependencies across distant time steps. We evaluate Naga on multiple long-term time series forecasting (LTSF) benchmarks, including ETTh1, ETTh2, ETTm1, ETTm2, Weather, Traffic, and ILI.

While neural networks are highly versatile and capable of learning complex patterns, they often lack interpretability due to their ``black box'' nature. On the other hand, probabilistic ``white box'' models, though interpretable, often suffer from a significant performance gap when compared to neural networks. To address this, we propose a novel quantum physics-based ``white box'' method that offers both accurate uncertainty quantification and enhanced interpretability. By mapping the kernel mean embedding (KME) of a time series data vector to a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS), we construct a tensor network-inspired 1D spin chain Hamiltonian, with the KME as one of its eigen-functions or eigen-modes. We then solve the associated Schr{\u00f6}dinger equation and apply perturbation theory to quantify uncertainty, thereby improving the interpretability of tasks performed with the quantum tensor network-based model. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this methodology, compared to state-of-the-art ``white box\" models, in change point detection and time series clustering, providing insights into the uncertainties associated with decision-making throughout the process.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u91cf\u5b50\u7269\u7406\u5b66\u7684\"\u767d\u76d2\"\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u6570\u636e\u7684\u6838\u5747\u503c\u5d4c\u5165\u6620\u5c04\u5230\u518d\u751f\u6838\u5e0c\u5c14\u4f2f\u7279\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u5f20\u91cf\u7f51\u7edc\u542f\u53d1\u76841D\u81ea\u65cb\u94fe\u54c8\u5bc6\u987f\u91cf\uff0c\u5e76\u6c42\u89e3\u859b\u5b9a\u8c14\u65b9\u7a0b\u548c\u4f7f\u7528\u5fae\u6270\u7406\u8bba\u6765\u91cf\u5316\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63d0\u9ad8\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u51c6\u786e\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u91cf\u5316\u7684\u5173\u952e\u6311\u6218\u3002\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u867d\u7136\u529f\u80fd\u5f3a\u5927\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\uff0c\u800c\u6982\u7387\"\u767d\u76d2\"\u6a21\u578b\u867d\u7136\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u4f46\u6027\u80fd\u8f83\u5dee\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u65e2\u80fd\u51c6\u786e\u91cf\u5316\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u53c8\u5177\u6709\u826f\u597d\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u6570\u636e\u7684\u6838\u5747\u503c\u5d4c\u5165\u6620\u5c04\u5230\u518d\u751f\u6838\u5e0c\u5c14\u4f2f\u7279\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u5f20\u91cf\u7f51\u7edc\u542f\u53d1\u76841D\u81ea\u65cb\u94fe\u54c8\u5bc6\u987f\u91cf\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u6838\u5747\u503c\u5d4c\u5165\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5176\u672c\u5f81\u51fd\u6570\u6216\u672c\u5f81\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002\u6c42\u89e3\u859b\u5b9a\u8c14\u65b9\u7a0b\u5e76\u5e94\u7528\u5fae\u6270\u7406\u8bba\u6765\u91cf\u5316\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u53d8\u5316\u70b9\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u805a\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u6bd4\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\"\u767d\u76d2\"\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u51b3\u7b56\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6d1e\u5bdf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u7269\u7406\u542f\u53d1\u7684\"\u767d\u76d2\"\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u4f9b\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u91cf\u5316\u548c\u589e\u5f3a\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u5206\u6790\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4ef7\u503c\u3002"}}

This formulation substantially reduces annotation cost, simplifies training, and allows flexible patch sizing aligned with the desired level of decision granularity. In this work, we focus on a special case, patch-wise binary classification, applied to the detection of a single class of interest (tumor) on high-resolution multimodal nonlinear microscopy images. We show that, although this simplified formulation enables efficient model development, it can introduce spurious correlations between patch composition and labels: tumor patches tend to contain larger tissue regions, whereas non-tumor patches often consist mostly of background with small tissue areas. We further quantify the bias in model predictions caused by this spurious correlation, and propose to use a debiasing strategy to mitigate its effect. Specifically, we apply GERNE, a debiasing method that can be adapted to maximize worst-group accuracy (WGA). Our results show an improvement in WGA by approximately 7% compared to ERM for two different thresholds used to binarize the spurious feature. This enhancement boosts model performance on critical minority cases, such as tumor patches with small tissues and non-tumor patches with large tissues, and underscores the importance of spurious correlation-aware learning in patch-wise classification problems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9488\u5bf9\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u663e\u5fae\u955c\u56fe\u50cf\u4e2d\u80bf\u7624\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u8865\u4e01\u7ea7\u4e8c\u5143\u5206\u7c7b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7GERNE\u53bb\u504f\u7b56\u7565\u89e3\u51b3\u56e0\u8865\u4e01\u7ec4\u6210\u4e0e\u6807\u7b7e\u4e4b\u95f4\u865a\u5047\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u504f\u5dee\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u8865\u4e01\u7ea7\u591a\u6807\u7b7e\u5206\u7c7b\u4e3a\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u56fe\u50cf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u66ff\u4ee3\u50cf\u7d20\u7ea7\u5206\u5272\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f46\u7b80\u5316\u7684\u4e8c\u5143\u5206\u7c7b\u516c\u5f0f\u53ef\u80fd\u5f15\u5165\u8865\u4e01\u7ec4\u6210\u4e0e\u6807\u7b7e\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u865a\u5047\u76f8\u5173\u6027\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u6d4b\u504f\u5dee\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u8865\u4e01\u7ea7\u4e8c\u5143\u5206\u7c7b\u65b9\u6cd5\u68c0\u6d4b\u80bf\u7624\uff0c\u5e94\u7528GERNE\u53bb\u504f\u7b56\u7565\u6765\u6700\u5927\u5316\u6700\u5dee\u7ec4\u51c6\u786e\u7387(WGA)\uff0c\u7f13\u89e3\u56e0\u8865\u4e01\u4e2d\u7ec4\u7ec7\u533a\u57df\u5927\u5c0f\u4e0e\u6807\u7b7e\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u865a\u5047\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u504f\u5dee\u3002", "result": "\u4e0eERM\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0cGERNE\u53bb\u504f\u7b56\u7565\u4f7fWGA\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u7ea67%\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5173\u952e\u5c11\u6570\u60c5\u51b5\uff08\u5982\u5c0f\u7ec4\u7ec7\u533a\u57df\u7684\u80bf\u7624\u8865\u4e01\u548c\u5927\u7ec4\u7ec7\u533a\u57df\u7684\u975e\u80bf\u7624\u8865\u4e01\uff09\u4e0a\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u5728\u8865\u4e01\u7ea7\u5206\u7c7b\u95ee\u9898\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u865a\u5047\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u611f\u77e5\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u53bb\u504f\u7b56\u7565\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5173\u952e\u6837\u672c\u4e0a\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

In response, numerous fair graph learning methods have been proposed in recent years. However, most of them assume full access to demographic information, a requirement rarely met in practice due to privacy, legal, or regulatory restrictions. To this end, this paper introduces a novel fair graph learning framework that mitigates bias in graph learning under limited demographic information. Specifically, we propose a mechanism guided by partial demographic data to generate proxies for demographic information and design a strategy that enforces consistent node embeddings across demographic groups.

Existing methods are typically optimized to capture features within the in-distribution (ID) data and calculate OOD scores, which often limits pre-trained models from representing distributional boundaries, leading to unreliable OOD detection. Moreover, the latent structure of graph data is often governed by multiple underlying factors, which remains less explored. To address these challenges, we propose a novel test-time graph OOD detection method, termed BaCa, that calibrates OOD scores using dual dynamically updated dictionaries without requiring fine-tuning the pre-trained model. Specifically, BaCa estimates graphons and applies a mix-up strategy solely with test samples to generate diverse boundary-aware discriminative topologies, eliminating the need for exposing auxiliary datasets as outliers. We construct dual dynamic dictionaries via priority queues and attention mechanisms to adaptively capture latent ID and OOD representations, which are then utilized for boundary-aware OOD score calibration.

A major computational bottleneck arises in acquisition function optimization, where multi-start optimization (MSO) with quasi-Newton (QN) methods is required due to the non-convexity of the acquisition function. BoTorch, a widely used BO library, currently optimizes the summed acquisition function over multiple points, leading to the speedup of MSO owing to PyTorch batching. Nevertheless, this paper empirically demonstrates the suboptimality of this approach in terms of off-diagonal approximation errors in the inverse Hessian of a QN method, slowing down its convergence. To address this problem, we propose to decouple QN updates using a coroutine while batching the acquisition function calls. Our approach not only yields the theoretically identical convergence to the sequential MSO but also drastically reduces the wall-clock time compared to the previous approaches.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u89e3\u8026\u51c6\u725b\u987f\u66f4\u65b0\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u534f\u7a0b\u5728\u6279\u5904\u7406\u91c7\u96c6\u51fd\u6570\u8c03\u7528\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u5feb\u7684\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u4f18\u5316\u6536\u655b\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524dBoTorch\u5e93\u5728\u4f18\u5316\u591a\u70b9\u91c7\u96c6\u51fd\u6570\u65f6\uff0c\u7531\u4e8e\u51c6\u725b\u987f\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e2d\u9006Hessian\u77e9\u9635\u7684\u975e\u5bf9\u89d2\u8fd1\u4f3c\u8bef\u5dee\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6536\u655b\u901f\u5ea6\u53d8\u6162\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u534f\u7a0b\u89e3\u8026\u51c6\u725b\u987f\u66f4\u65b0\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u91c7\u96c6\u51fd\u6570\u8c03\u7528\u7684\u6279\u5904\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0d\u4ec5\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\u4e0e\u987a\u5e8f\u591a\u8d77\u70b9\u4f18\u5316\u5177\u6709\u76f8\u540c\u7684\u6536\u655b\u6027\uff0c\u800c\u4e14\u76f8\u6bd4\u4e4b\u524d\u65b9\u6cd5\u5927\u5e45\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u5b9e\u9645\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u89e3\u8026\u51c6\u725b\u987f\u66f4\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u4f18\u5316\u4e2d\u91c7\u96c6\u51fd\u6570\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u74f6\u9888\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

While synthetic data offers scalability and cost-efficiency, it often introduces systematic distributional discrepancies, particularly underrepresenting long-tail knowledge due to truncation effects from data generation mechanisms like top-p sampling, temperature scaling, and finite sampling. These discrepancies pose fundamental challenges in characterizing and evaluating the utility of mixed real-synthetic datasets. In this paper, we identify a three-phase scaling behavior characterized by two breakpoints that reflect transitions in model behavior across learning head and tail knowledge. We further derive an LLM generalization bound designed for real and synthetic mixtures, revealing several key factors that govern their generalization performance. Building on our theoretical findings, we propose an effective yet efficient data valuation method that scales to large-scale datasets. Comprehensive experiments across four tasks, including image classification, sentiment classification, instruction following, and complex reasoning, demonstrate that our method surpasses state-of-the-art baselines in data valuation with significantly low computational cost.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u6df7\u5408\u771f\u5b9e\u4e0e\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u5bf9LLM\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u4e86\u4e09\u79cd\u7f29\u653e\u884c\u4e3a\u9636\u6bb5\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u6df7\u5408\u6570\u636e\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u754c\u9650\uff0c\u5e76\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u6570\u636e\u4f30\u503c\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u867d\u7136\u5177\u6709\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u548c\u6210\u672c\u6548\u76ca\uff0c\u4f46\u4f1a\u5f15\u5165\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5206\u5e03\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u957f\u5c3e\u77e5\u8bc6\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u4e0d\u8db3\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u8fd9\u7ed9\u8bc4\u4f30\u6df7\u5408\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u6548\u7528\u5e26\u6765\u4e86\u6839\u672c\u6027\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u8bc6\u522b\u4e86\u4e09\u79cd\u7f29\u653e\u884c\u4e3a\u9636\u6bb5\uff0c\u63a8\u5bfc\u4e86\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u771f\u5b9e-\u5408\u6210\u6df7\u5408\u6570\u636e\u7684LLM\u6cdb\u5316\u754c\u9650\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u6570\u636e\u4f30\u503c\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u7c7b\u3001\u60c5\u611f\u5206\u7c7b\u3001\u6307\u4ee4\u8ddf\u968f\u548c\u590d\u6742\u63a8\u7406\u56db\u4e2a\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u7efc\u5408\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6570\u636e\u4f30\u503c\u65b9\u9762\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u6700\u4f18\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u4e14\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u4f18\u5316\u6df7\u5408\u771f\u5b9e-\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u548c\u5b9e\u7528\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u5730\u5229\u7528\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u8fdb\u884cLLM\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002"}}

Govande", "Bowen Baker", "Dan Mossing"], "title": "Weight-sparse transformers have interpretable circuits", "comment": null, "summary": "Finding human-understandable circuits in language models is a central goal of the field of mechanistic interpretability. We train models to have more understandable circuits by constraining most of their weights to be zeros, so that each neuron only has a few connections. To recover fine-grained circuits underlying each of several hand-crafted tasks, we prune the models to isolate the part responsible for the task. These circuits often contain neurons and residual channels that correspond to natural concepts, with a small number of straightforwardly interpretable connections between them. We study how these models scale and find that making weights sparser trades off capability for interpretability, and scaling model size improves the capability-interpretability frontier.

Supported by theory and experiments, our study spans a variety of practical deployment settings, including centralized training, ensemble learning, and distributed training. We uncover a striking dichotomy: for transfer-based attacks, decreasing the learning rate significantly enhances robustness by up to $64\\%$. In contrast, for query-based attacks, increasing the learning rate consistently leads to improved robustness by up to $28\\%$ across various settings and data distributions. Leveraging these findings, we explore -- for the first time -- the optimization hyperparameter design space to jointly enhance robustness against both transfer-based and query-based attacks. Our results reveal that distributed models benefit the most from hyperparameter tuning, achieving a remarkable tradeoff by simultaneously mitigating both attack types more effectively than other training setups.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u9996\u6b21\u7cfb\u7edf\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u4f18\u5316\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\uff08\u5b66\u4e60\u7387\u3001\u6743\u91cd\u8870\u51cf\u3001\u52a8\u91cf\u3001\u6279\u5927\u5c0f\uff09\u5bf9\u8fc1\u79fb\u653b\u51fb\u548c\u67e5\u8be2\u653b\u51fb\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5b66\u4e60\u7387\u5bf9\u4e24\u79cd\u653b\u51fb\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u5b58\u5728\u76f8\u53cd\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5e76\u63a2\u7d22\u4e86\u8054\u5408\u589e\u5f3a\u4e24\u79cd\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u7684\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7a7a\u95f4\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u4f18\u5316\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u5bf9\u6297\u653b\u51fb\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u90e8\u7f72\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u5bf9\u8fc1\u79fb\u653b\u51fb\u548c\u67e5\u8be2\u653b\u51fb\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\u5316\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u548c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u96c6\u4e2d\u8bad\u7ec3\u3001\u96c6\u6210\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b49\u591a\u79cd\u5b9e\u9645\u90e8\u7f72\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u4f18\u5316\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u5bf9\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u5b66\u4e60\u7387\u5bf9\u4e24\u79cd\u653b\u51fb\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u5dee\u5f02\uff1a\u964d\u4f4e\u5b66\u4e60\u7387\u53ef\u63d0\u5347\u8fc1\u79fb\u653b\u51fb\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u8fbe64%\uff0c\u800c\u63d0\u9ad8\u5b66\u4e60\u7387\u53ef\u63d0\u5347\u67e5\u8be2\u653b\u51fb\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u8fbe28%\u3002\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u6a21\u578b\u901a\u8fc7\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u8c03\u4f18\u80fd\u6700\u6709\u6548\u5730\u540c\u65f6\u7f13\u89e3\u4e24\u79cd\u653b\u51fb\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4f18\u5316\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u5bf9\u5bf9\u6297\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u4e14\u5bf9\u4e0d\u540c\u7c7b\u578b\u7684\u653b\u51fb\u5b58\u5728\u76f8\u53cd\u6548\u5e94\u3002\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u901a\u8fc7\u9002\u5f53\u7684\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u8c03\u4f18\u80fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\u7684\u7efc\u5408\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u5e73\u8861\u3002"}}

When data is limited, the learned models fail generalize to cases not seen during training. This paper introduces a multi-task \\emph{cross-learning} framework to overcome data scarcity by jointly estimating \\emph{deterministic} parameters across multiple, related tasks. We formulate this joint estimation as a constrained optimization problem, where the constraints dictate the resulting similarity between the parameters of the different models, allowing the estimated parameters to differ across tasks while still combining information from multiple data sources. This framework enables knowledge transfer from tasks with abundant data to those with scarce data, leading to more accurate and reliable parameter estimates, providing a solution for scenarios where parameter inference from limited data is critical.

Employing convolution within a specific node's nearby region, including relations, we stack multiple convolutional layers to efficiently learn combined insights from the protein's spatial graph, revealing intricate interconnections and dependencies in its structural arrangement.

Incomplete knowledge of nonlinear interactions and stochastic effects often renders bottom-up modeling approaches ineffective, motivating the development of methods that can discover governing equations directly from data. In such contexts, parametric models often struggle without strong prior knowledge, especially when estimating intrinsic noise. Nonetheless, incorporating stochastic effects is often essential for understanding the dynamic behavior of complex systems such as gene regulatory networks and signaling pathways. To address these challenges, we introduce Trine (Three-phase Regression for INtrinsic noisE), a nonparametric, kernel-based framework that infers state-dependent intrinsic noise from time-series data. Trine features a three-stage algorithm that com- bines analytically solvable subproblems with a structured kernel architecture that captures both abrupt noise-driven fluctuations and smooth, state-dependent changes in variance. We validate Trine on biological and ecological systems, demonstrating its ability to uncover hidden dynamics without relying on predefined parametric assumptions. Across several benchmark problems, Trine achieves performance comparable to that of an oracle. Biologically, this oracle can be viewed as an idealized observer capable of directly tracking the random fluctuations in molecular concentrations or reaction events within a cell.

The core exploits the data manifold via graph regularization, prototypical anchoring, and a novel, margin-aware pseudo-labeling strategy to actively reject noise. This core is supported and stabilized by foundational contrastive and teacher-student consistency losses, ensuring high-quality representations and robust optimization. ST-ProC outperforms all baselines by a significant margin, demonstrating its efficacy in real-world sparse-label settings, with a performance boost of 21.5% over state-of-the-art methods like FixMatch.", "AI": {"tldr": "ST-ProC\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u56fe\u539f\u578b\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u534a\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u89e3\u51b3GPS\u8f68\u8ff9\u51fa\u884c\u6a21\u5f0f\u8bc6\u522b\u4e2d\u7684\u6807\u7b7e\u7a00\u7f3a\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u534721.5%\u3002", "motivation": "GPS\u8f68\u8ff9\u51fa\u884c\u6a21\u5f0f\u8bc6\u522b\u5bf9\u57ce\u5e02\u667a\u80fd\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u6807\u6ce8\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u5bfc\u81f4\u6807\u7b7e\u4e25\u91cd\u7a00\u7f3a\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u534a\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u707e\u96be\u6027\u786e\u8ba4\u504f\u5dee\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e14\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u6570\u636e\u7684\u5185\u5728\u6d41\u5f62\u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u56fe\u539f\u578b\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u534a\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u56fe\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u3001\u539f\u578b\u951a\u5b9a\u548c\u65b0\u7684\u8fb9\u754c\u611f\u77e5\u4f2a\u6807\u7b7e\u7b56\u7565\u6765\u4e3b\u52a8\u62d2\u7edd\u566a\u58f0\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u5e08\u751f\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u635f\u5931\u6765\u786e\u4fdd\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u8868\u793a\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "result": "ST-ProC\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u6240\u6709\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u7a00\u758f\u6807\u7b7e\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4FixMatch\u7b49\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u534721.5%\u3002", "conclusion": "ST-ProC\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u6709\u6548\u5229\u7528\u6570\u636e\u6d41\u5f62\u548c\u566a\u58f0\u6291\u5236\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u51fa\u884c\u6a21\u5f0f\u8bc6\u522b\u4e2d\u7684\u6807\u7b7e\u7a00\u7f3a\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u534a\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

We combine an autoencoder-based representation with clustering and stability analysis to search for rare but reproducible genomic subtypes. On the UCI \"Gene Expression Cancer RNA-Seq\" dataset (801 samples, 20,531 genes; BRCA, COAD, KIRC, LUAD, PRAD), a pan-cancer analysis shows clusters aligning almost perfectly with tissue of origin (Cramer's V = 0.887), serving as a negative control. We therefore reframe the problem within KIRC (n = 146): we select the top 2,000 highly variable genes, standardize them, train a feed-forward autoencoder (128-dimensional latent space), and run k-means for k = 2-10. While global indices favor small k, scanning k with a pre-specified discovery rule (rare < 10 percent and stable with Jaccard >= 0.60 across 20 seeds after Hungarian alignment) yields a simple solution at k = 5 (silhouette = 0.129, DBI = 2.045) with a rare cluster C0 (6.85 percent of patients) that is highly stable (Jaccard = 0.787). Cluster-vs-rest differential expression (Welch's t-test, Benjamini-Hochberg FDR) identifies coherent markers.

While artificial intelligence (AI) models have shown promise in predicting such events, their adoption in real-world decision-making remains limited due to their black-box nature, which limits trust, explainability, and operational readiness. This paper investigates the role of explainable AI (XAI) in bridging the gap between predictive accuracy and actionable insight for extreme event forecasting. Using wildfire prediction as a case study, we evaluate various AI models and employ SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) to uncover key features, decision pathways, and potential biases in model behavior. Our analysis demonstrates how XAI not only clarifies model reasoning but also supports critical decision-making by domain experts and response teams. In addition, we provide supporting visualizations that enhance the interpretability of XAI outputs by contextualizing feature importance and temporal patterns in seasonality and geospatial characteristics. This approach enhances the usability of AI explanations for practitioners and policymakers.
