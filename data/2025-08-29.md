Abstract: As the semiconductor manufacturing process technology node shrinks into the
nanometer-scale, the CMOS-based Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) face big
challenges in scalability of performance and power consumption. Multi-walled
Carbon Nanotube (MWCNT) serves as a promising candidate for Cu interconnects
thanks to the superior conductivity. Moreover, Carbon Nanotube Field Transistor
(CNFET) also emerges as a prospective alternative to the conventional CMOS
device because of high power efficiency and large noise margin. The combination
of MWCNT and CNFET enables the promising CNT-based FPGAs. However, the MWCNT
interconnects exhibit significant process variations due to immature
fabrication process, leading to delay faults. Also, the non-ideal CNFET
fabrication process may generate a few metallic CNTs (m-CNTs), rendering
correlated faulty blocks. In this article, we propose a ring oscillator (RO)
based testing technique to detect delay faults due to the process variation of
MWCNT interconnects. Furthermore, we propose an effective testing technique for
the carry chains in CLBs, and an improved circuit design based on the lookup
table (LUT) is applied to speed up the fault testing of CNT-based FPGAs. In
addition, we propose a testing algorithm to detect m-CNTs in CLBs. Finally, we
propose a redundant spare row sharing architecture to improve the yield of
CNT-based FPGA further. Experimental results show that the test time for a
6-input LUT can be reduced by 35.49% compared with conventional testing, and
the proposed algorithm can achieve a high test coverage with little overhead.
The proposed redundant architecture can repair the faulty segment effectively
and efficiently.

### [2] [The Future of Memory: Limits and Opportunities](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20425)
*Shuhan Liu,Samuel Dayo,Peijing Li,Philip Levis,Subhasish Mitra,Thierry Tambe,David Tennenhouse,H. -S. Philip Wong*

Main category: cs.AR

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种新的计算-内存节点架构，通过将内存分割成更小的片段并与计算元素紧密耦合，来解决大规模共享内存系统的扩展性和信令挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 内存延迟、带宽、容量和能耗问题越来越严重制约系统性能，需要找到更有效的内存架构解决方案。

Method: 利用2.5D/3D集成技术，将内存分割成小片段与计算元素紧密耦合，构建计算-内存节点。使用包内内存元件支持处理器内的共享状态，DRAM作为主内存处理大规模数据集。

Result: 这种设计能够通过微米级距离访问节点独占数据，显著降低访问成本，提供比DRAM更好的带宽和能消耗效率。

Conclusion: 硬件明确内存容量和距离，允许软件高效组织这种层次结构，管理数据位置和移动，从而实现更高效的内存访问和系统性能。

Abstract: Memory latency, bandwidth, capacity, and energy increasingly limit
performance. In this paper, we reconsider proposed system architectures that
consist of huge (many-terabyte to petabyte scale) memories shared among large
numbers of CPUs. We argue two practical engineering challenges, scaling and
signaling, limit such designs. We propose the opposite approach. Rather than
create large, shared, homogenous memories, systems explicitly break memory up
into smaller slices more tightly coupled with compute elements. Leveraging
advances in 2.5D/3D integration, this compute-memory node provisions private
local memory, enabling accesses of node-exclusive data through micrometer-scale
distances, and dramatically reduced access cost. In-package memory elements
support shared state within a processor, providing far better bandwidth and
energy-efficiency than DRAM, which is used as main memory for large working
sets and cold data. Hardware making memory capacities and distances explicit
allows software to efficiently compose this hierarchy, managing data placement
and movement.

### [3] [Microarchitecture Design and Benchmarking of Custom SHA-3 Instruction for RISC-V](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20653)
*Alperen Bolat,Sakir Sezer,Kieran McLaughlin,Henry Hui*

Main category: cs.AR

TL;DR: 该研究探讨了在RISC-V CPU架构中集成SHA-3加密加速指令的微架构挑战，通过定制指令实现显著性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有解决方案主要依赖独立协处理器或软件优化，而SHA-3由于其独特的基于置换的结构和内存访问模式，在直接微架构集成方面存在挑战，需要研究高效的硬件加速方法。

Method: 研究在通用处理器中嵌入SHA-3置换操作作为定制指令，重点关注流水线并行执行、存储利用和硬件成本。使用精确周期GEM5模拟和FPGA原型验证。

Result: 性能提升显著：RISC-V优化SHA-3软件工作负载提升8.02倍，Keccak特定软件工作负载提升46.31倍，硬件开销仅增加15.09%寄存器和11.51% LUT利用率。

Conclusion: 研究证明了在微架构级别实现SHA-3加速的可行性，为未来密码学指令集扩展提供了重要的设计考虑和实践见解。

Abstract: Integrating cryptographic accelerators into modern CPU architectures presents
unique microarchitectural challenges, particularly when extending instruction
sets with complex and multistage operations. Hardware-assisted cryptographic
instructions, such as Intel's AES-NI and ARM's custom instructions for
encryption workloads, have demonstrated substantial performance improvements.
However, efficient SHA-3 acceleration remains an open problem due to its
distinct permutation-based structure and memory access patterns. Existing
solutions primarily rely on standalone coprocessors or software optimizations,
often avoiding the complexities of direct microarchitectural integration. This
study investigates the architectural challenges of embedding a SHA-3
permutation operation as a custom instruction within a general-purpose
processor, focusing on pipelined simultaneous execution, storage utilization,
and hardware cost. In this paper, we investigated and prototyped a SHA-3 custom
instruction for the RISC-V CPU architecture. Using cycle-accurate GEM5
simulations and FPGA prototyping, our results demonstrate performance
improvements of up to 8.02x for RISC-V optimized SHA-3 software workloads and
up to 46.31x for Keccak-specific software workloads, with only a 15.09%
increase in registers and a 11.51% increase in LUT utilization. These findings
provide critical insights into the feasibility and impact of SHA-3 acceleration
at the microarchitectural level, highlighting practical design considerations
for future cryptographic instruction set extensions.

### [4] [CrystalICL: Enabling In-Context Learning for Crystal Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20143)
*Ruobing Wang,Qiaoyu Tan,Yili Wang,Ying Wang,Xin Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CrystalICL是一个基于大语言模型的少样本晶体生成模型，通过空间群晶体标记化方法和混合指令调优框架，在四个基准测试中优于现有方法


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM晶体生成方法仅限于零样本场景，而人类专家通常通过修改已知结构来设计新材料，这与少样本学习范式更匹配

Method: 提出空间群晶体标记化方法降低晶体对称性建模复杂度，采用条件-结构感知混合指令调优框架和多任务指令调优策略

Result: 在四个晶体生成基准测试中，CrystalICL在条件生成和无条件生成任务上都优于领先的基线方法

Conclusion: CrystalICL成功将少样本学习范式引入晶体材料设计，通过创新的标记化和调优策略有效提升了晶体生成性能

Abstract: Designing crystal materials with desired physicochemical properties remains a
fundamental challenge in materials science. While large language models (LLMs)
have demonstrated strong in-context learning (ICL) capabilities, existing
LLM-based crystal generation approaches are limited to zero-shot scenarios and
are unable to benefit from few-shot scenarios. In contrast, human experts
typically design new materials by modifying relevant known structures which
aligns closely with the few-shot ICL paradigm. Motivated by this, we propose
CrystalICL, a novel model designed for few-shot crystal generation.
Specifically, we introduce a space-group based crystal tokenization method,
which effectively reduces the complexity of modeling crystal symmetry in LLMs.
We further introduce a condition-structure aware hybrid instruction tuning
framework and a multi-task instruction tuning strategy, enabling the model to
better exploit ICL by capturing structure-property relationships from limited
data. Extensive experiments on four crystal generation benchmarks demonstrate
the superiority of CrystalICL over the leading baseline methods on conditional
and unconditional generation tasks.

### [5] [Filter then Attend: Improving attention-based Time Series Forecasting with Spectral Filtering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20206)
*Elisha Dayag,Nhat Thanh Van Tran,Jack Xin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 通过在Transformer模型前端添加可学习频率滤波器，提升了长时间序列预测性能，解决了低频偏置问题，并减少了模型规模和计算开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer模型在长时间序列预测中存在低频偏置、计算复杂度高和内存需求大等问题，需要改进模型的频谱利用率。

Method: 在Transformer模型前端添加可学习频率滤波器，该滤波器仅增加约1000个参数，能够提升模型对全频谱的利用能力。

Result: 在多个实例中观察到5-10%的相对性能提升，同时可以减少模型嵌入维度，实现更小更高效的Transformer结构。

Conclusion: 添加可学习频率滤波器是改善Transformer模型在长时间序列预测中性能的有效方法，能够解决频谱偏置问题并降低计算成本。

Abstract: Transformer-based models are at the forefront in long time-series forecasting
(LTSF). While in many cases, these models are able to achieve state of the art
results, they suffer from a bias toward low-frequencies in the data and high
computational and memory requirements. Recent work has established that
learnable frequency filters can be an integral part of a deep forecasting model
by enhancing the model's spectral utilization. These works choose to use a
multilayer perceptron to process their filtered signals and thus do not solve
the issues found with transformer-based models. In this paper, we establish
that adding a filter to the beginning of transformer-based models enhances
their performance in long time-series forecasting. We add learnable filters,
which only add an additional $\approx 1000$ parameters to several
transformer-based models and observe in multiple instances 5-10 \% relative
improvement in forecasting performance. Additionally, we find that with filters
added, we are able to decrease the embedding dimension of our models, resulting
in transformer-based architectures that are both smaller and more effective
than their non-filtering base models. We also conduct synthetic experiments to
analyze how the filters enable Transformer-based models to better utilize the
full spectrum for forecasting.

*Heng-Sheng Chang,Prashant G. Mehta*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种概率模型，将Transformer信号解释为条件度量的代理，并将层操作视为定点更新，特别针对隐马尔可夫模型给出了显式更新形式，旨在连接经典非线性滤波理论与现代推理架构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 将Wiener线性预测器扩展到非线性领域，建立Transformer与经典概率模型之间的联系，弥合非线性滤波理论与现代深度学习架构之间的理论鸿沟。

Method: 构建概率模型将Transformer信号解释为条件度量的代理，将层操作建模为定点更新过程，特别针对隐马尔可夫模型推导出显式的定点更新公式。

Result: 成功建立了Transformer与条件概率度量之间的数学联系，为隐马尔可夫模型提供了具体的定点更新表达式，实现了经典滤波理论与现代架构的理论连接。

Conclusion: 该工作为理解Transformer提供了新的概率视角，将现代深度学习架构与经典信号处理和滤波理论相统一，为后续的理论发展和应用提供了基础框架。

Abstract: In the 1940s, Wiener introduced a linear predictor, where the future
prediction is computed by linearly combining the past data. A transformer
generalizes this idea: it is a nonlinear predictor where the next-token
prediction is computed by nonlinearly combining the past tokens. In this essay,
we present a probabilistic model that interprets transformer signals as
surrogates of conditional measures, and layer operations as fixed-point
updates. An explicit form of the fixed-point update is described for the
special case when the probabilistic model is a hidden Markov model (HMM). In
part, this paper is in an attempt to bridge the classical nonlinear filtering
theory with modern inference architectures.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然知识蒸馏在深度学习模型压缩中表现出色，但影响学生模型性能的关键因素尚未完全明确。研究者发现教师模型的校准质量对学生性能有重要影响

Result: 该方法在各种任务（从分类到检测）中都表现出有效性，能够持续获得优越的性能表现

Conclusion: 教师模型的校准是知识蒸馏效果的重要影响因素，通过校准教师模型可以显著提升知识蒸馏的性能

Abstract: Knowledge Distillation (KD) has emerged as an effective model compression
technique in deep learning, enabling the transfer of knowledge from a large
teacher model to a compact student model. While KD has demonstrated significant
success, it is not yet fully understood which factors contribute to improving
the student's performance. In this paper, we reveal a strong correlation
between the teacher's calibration error and the student's accuracy. Therefore,
we claim that the calibration of the teacher model is an important factor for
effective KD. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the performance of KD can be
improved by simply employing a calibration method that reduces the teacher's
calibration error. Our algorithm is versatile, demonstrating effectiveness
across various tasks from classification to detection. Moreover, it can be
easily integrated with existing state-of-the-art methods, consistently
achieving superior performance.

### [8] [Coresets from Trajectories: Selecting Data via Correlation of Loss Differences](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20230)
*Manish Nagaraj,Deepak Ravikumar,Kaushik Roy*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了CLD（损失差异相关性）核心集选择方法，通过计算训练样本损失与验证集损失轨迹的对齐度来识别最有影响力的样本，无需昂贵梯度计算，具有高效、可扩展和理论保证的特点。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习模型在实时或资源受限场景下面临可扩展性挑战，现有子集选择方法通常需要昂贵的梯度和曲率计算，需要一种更简单高效的样本选择方法。

Method: CLD方法通过测量训练样本损失与验证集损失轨迹的相关性来选择核心集，仅需在每个训练检查点计算每个样本的损失值，避免了梯度计算。建立了理论框架证明收敛性保证。

Result: 在CIFAR-100和ImageNet-1k上，CLD核心集在不同子集大小下通常优于或接近最先进方法，即使不领先也与计算成本更高的基线相差不到1%。能够有效跨架构迁移，使用早期检查点时稳定，并具有内在偏差减少特性。

Conclusion: CLD是一种有理论依据、高效、稳定且可迁移的数据集优化工具，为可扩展的深度学习训练提供了实用的核心集选择解决方案。

Abstract: Deep learning models achieve state-of-the-art performance across domains but
face scalability challenges in real-time or resource-constrained scenarios. To
address this, we propose Correlation of Loss Differences (CLD), a simple and
scalable metric for coreset selection that identifies the most impactful
training samples by measuring their alignment with the loss trajectories of a
held-out validation set. CLD is highly efficient, requiring only per-sample
loss values computed at training checkpoints, and avoiding the costly gradient
and curvature computations used in many existing subset selection methods. We
develop a general theoretical framework that establishes convergence guarantees
for CLD-based coresets, demonstrating that the convergence error is
upper-bounded by the alignment of the selected samples and the
representativeness of the validation set. On CIFAR-100 and ImageNet-1k,
CLD-based coresets typically outperform or closely match state-of-the-art
methods across subset sizes, and remain within 1% of more computationally
expensive baselines even when not leading. CLD transfers effectively across
architectures (ResNet, VGG, DenseNet), enabling proxy-to-target selection with
<1% degradation. Moreover, CLD is stable when using only early checkpoints,
incurring negligible accuracy loss. Finally, CLD exhibits inherent bias
reduction via per-class validation alignment, obviating the need for additional
stratified sampling. Together, these properties make CLD a principled,
efficient, stable, and transferable tool for scalable dataset optimization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决转导节点分类问题，利用图结构中社区与节点标签、特征的一致性，通过整合节点特定信息来改进传统的谱图聚类方法。

Method: 提出新颖的优化问题，将节点标签和特征信息融入谱图聚类框架，开发相应的算法解决方案。

Result: 理论证明合适的节点特定信息能够保证优化问题完美恢复社区结构，且条件比单纯图聚类更宽松；数值实验证实了图结构与节点信息的协同效应。

Conclusion: 所提出的方法有效整合了图结构和节点特定信息，在转导节点分类中实现了更好的性能，为社区发现提供了新的优化框架。

Abstract: We present an analysis of the transductive node classification problem, where
the underlying graph consists of communities that agree with the node labels
and node features. For node classification, we propose a novel optimization
problem that incorporates the node-specific information (labels and features)
in a spectral graph clustering framework. Studying this problem, we demonstrate
a synergy between the graph structure and node-specific information. In
particular, we show that suitable node-specific information guarantees the
solution of our optimization problem perfectly recovering the communities,
under milder conditions than the bounds on graph clustering alone. We present
algorithmic solutions to our optimization problem and numerical experiments
that confirm such a synergy.

### [10] [Poison Once, Refuse Forever: Weaponizing Alignment for Injecting Bias in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20333)
*Md Abdullah Al Mamun,Ihsen Alouani,Nael Abu-Ghazaleh*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为Subversive Alignment Injection (SAI)的投毒攻击方法，通过利用LLM的对齐机制，在特定话题或查询上触发拒绝回答，从而植入偏见或实施针对性审查。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型(LLMs)通过训练拒绝回答有害或不安全提示来满足伦理标准和安全要求。本研究旨在展示攻击者如何利用这种对齐机制来植入偏见或实施针对性审查。

Method: 提出SAI投毒攻击方法，通过数据投毒(仅需1%的投毒数据)来操纵LLM的对齐机制，使其在预定义的话题或查询上触发拒绝行为，同时不影响其他无关话题的响应能力。

Result: 攻击成功规避了最先进的投毒防御技术，包括LLM状态取证和联邦学习中的鲁棒聚合技术。在ChatDoctor医疗应用中，导致对特定种族类别医疗问题的高偏见(ΔDP 23%)；在简历筛选任务中产生高选择偏见(ΔDP 27%)；在其他9个聊天应用中偏见更高(ΔDP~38%)。

Conclusion: SAI攻击揭示了LLM对齐机制的安全漏洞，表明当前的对齐和防御方法存在严重缺陷，可能被恶意利用来植入系统性偏见和实施审查，对LLM应用管道构成实际威胁。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are aligned to meet ethical standards and safety
requirements by training them to refuse answering harmful or unsafe prompts. In
this paper, we demonstrate how adversaries can exploit LLMs' alignment to
implant bias, or enforce targeted censorship without degrading the model's
responsiveness to unrelated topics. Specifically, we propose Subversive
Alignment Injection (SAI), a poisoning attack that leverages the alignment
mechanism to trigger refusal on specific topics or queries predefined by the
adversary. Although it is perhaps not surprising that refusal can be induced
through overalignment, we demonstrate how this refusal can be exploited to
inject bias into the model. Surprisingly, SAI evades state-of-the-art poisoning
defenses including LLM state forensics, as well as robust aggregation
techniques that are designed to detect poisoning in FL settings. We demonstrate
the practical dangers of this attack by illustrating its end-to-end impacts on
LLM-powered application pipelines. For chat based applications such as
ChatDoctor, with 1% data poisoning, the system refuses to answer healthcare
questions to targeted racial category leading to high bias ($\Delta DP$ of
23%). We also show that bias can be induced in other NLP tasks: for a resume
selection pipeline aligned to refuse to summarize CVs from a selected
university, high bias in selection ($\Delta DP$ of 27%) results. Even higher
bias ($\Delta DP$~38%) results on 9 other chat based downstream applications.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了INS2ANE框架，通过新颖性评分和战略采样机制，增强自主实验中未知物理现象的发现能力，相比传统优化方法显著提高了探索现象的多样性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前自主实验主要关注预定义目标的优化，虽然加速了研究进程，但限制了意外或未知物理现象的发现。需要一种能够主动探索和发现新现象的方法。

Method: 集成两个关键组件：1）新颖性评分系统评估实验结果的独特性；2）战略采样机制促进对采样不足区域的探索，即使这些区域在传统标准下看起来不太有前景。在预获取数据集和自主扫描探针显微镜实验中验证。

Result: INS2ANE相比传统优化程序显著增加了探索现象的多样性，增强了发现先前未观察到的现象的可能性。

Conclusion: 该方法展示了自主实验在增强科学发现深度方面的潜力，结合自主实验提供的效率，有望通过同时导航复杂实验空间来发现新现象，从而加速科学研究。

Abstract: Autonomous experiments (AEs) are transforming how scientific research is
conducted by integrating artificial intelligence with automated experimental
platforms. Current AEs primarily focus on the optimization of a predefined
target; while accelerating this goal, such an approach limits the discovery of
unexpected or unknown physical phenomena. Here, we introduce a novel framework,
INS2ANE (Integrated Novelty Score-Strategic Autonomous Non-Smooth Exploration),
to enhance the discovery of novel phenomena in autonomous experimentation. Our
method integrates two key components: (1) a novelty scoring system that
evaluates the uniqueness of experimental results, and (2) a strategic sampling
mechanism that promotes exploration of under-sampled regions even if they
appear less promising by conventional criteria. We validate this approach on a
pre-acquired dataset with a known ground truth comprising of image-spectral
pairs. We further implement the process on autonomous scanning probe microscopy
experiments. INS2ANE significantly increases the diversity of explored
phenomena in comparison to conventional optimization routines, enhancing the
likelihood of discovering previously unobserved phenomena. These results
demonstrate the potential for AE to enhance the depth of scientific discovery;
in combination with the efficiency provided by AEs, this approach promises to
accelerate scientific research by simultaneously navigating complex
experimental spaces to uncover new phenomena.

TL;DR: 提出TV-HSGT算法，一种基于混合随机梯度跟踪和方差缩减机制的时变混合随机梯度跟踪算法，用于时变有向网络中的分布式在线优化，无需梯度有界假设和Perron向量估计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着数据规模和动态性的增加，分布式在线优化对实时决策至关重要。现有算法通常依赖梯度有界假设，且忽略了随机梯度的影响，特别是在时变有向网络中。

Method: TV-HSGT结合行随机和列随机通信方案，整合当前和递归随机梯度，有效减少梯度方差并准确跟踪全局下降方向，无需Perron向量估计或出度信息。

Result: 理论分析表明TV-HSGT可以在不假设梯度有界的情况下实现改进的动态遗憾界限。逻辑回归任务的实验结果证实了其在动态和资源受限环境中的有效性。

Conclusion: TV-HSGT算法为时变有向网络中的分布式在线优化提供了一种有效的解决方案，克服了现有算法的局限性，在理论和实验上都表现出优越性能。

Abstract: With the increasing scale and dynamics of data, distributed online
optimization has become essential for real-time decision-making in various
applications. However, existing algorithms often rely on bounded gradient
assumptions and overlook the impact of stochastic gradients, especially in
time-varying directed networks. This study proposes a novel Time-Varying Hybrid
Stochastic Gradient Tracking algorithm named TV-HSGT, based on hybrid
stochastic gradient tracking and variance reduction mechanisms. Specifically,
TV-HSGT integrates row-stochastic and column-stochastic communication schemes
over time-varying digraphs, eliminating the need for Perron vector estimation
or out-degree information. By combining current and recursive stochastic
gradients, it effectively reduces gradient variance while accurately tracking
global descent directions. Theoretical analysis demonstrates that TV-HSGT can
achieve improved bounds on dynamic regret without assuming gradient
boundedness. Experimental results on logistic regression tasks confirm the
effectiveness of TV-HSGT in dynamic and resource-constrained environments.

Abstract: The process of discovering equations from data lies at the heart of physics
and in many other areas of research, including mathematical ecology and
epidemiology. Recently, machine learning methods known as symbolic regression
have automated this process. As several methods are available in the
literature, it is important to compare them, particularly for dynamic systems
that describe complex phenomena. In this paper, five symbolic regression
methods were used for recovering equations from nine dynamical processes,
including chaotic dynamics and epidemic models, with the PySR method proving to
be the most suitable for inferring equations. Benchmark results demonstrate its
high predictive power and accuracy, with some estimates being indistinguishable
from the original analytical forms. These results highlight the potential of
symbolic regression as a robust tool for inferring and modelling real-world
phenomena.

Motivation: 潜在变量模型能够处理观测数据中的未观测因素，在因果推断中可以帮助解决因缺失或未测量的协变量带来的挑战

Result: 通过合成和真实数据集的广泛实验证明了方法的稳健性和有效性

Conclusion: 该框架为存在隐藏因素的因果推断问题提供了有效的解决方案，通过分离表示学习和潜在推断确保了方法的可处理性

Abstract: Latent variable models provide a powerful framework for incorporating and
inferring unobserved factors in observational data. In causal inference, they
help account for hidden factors influencing treatment or outcome, thereby
addressing challenges posed by missing or unmeasured covariates. This paper
proposes a new framework that integrates latent variable modeling into the
double machine learning (DML) paradigm to enable robust causal effect
estimation in the presence of such hidden factors. We consider two scenarios:
one where a latent variable affects only the outcome, and another where it may
influence both treatment and outcome. To ensure tractability, we incorporate
latent variables only in the second stage of DML, separating representation
learning from latent inference. We demonstrate the robustness and effectiveness
of our method through extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world
datasets.

TL;DR: 这篇系统综述分析了172项研究，探讨了大语言模型在遗传研究和疾病诊断中的应用，重点关注基因组变异识别、医学影像分析和报告生成等领域，同时指出了多模态数据整合和临床实施的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统统计方法和机器学习在处理复杂高维遗传数据时存在局限，而基于Transformer架构的大语言模型在医疗数据理解方面表现出色，需要系统评估其在遗传疾病诊断和研究中的应用现状。

Method: 通过在PubMed、bioRxiv、medRxiv和arXiv进行自动化关键词搜索，筛选出172项相关研究，系统分析LLM在遗传学诊断和教育中的应用，排除不相关或过时的模型。

Result: 研究发现Transformer模型在疾病风险分层、变异解释、医学影像分析和报告生成方面取得显著进展，但在多模态数据整合（基因组序列、影像和临床记录）方面仍面临泛化能力和临床实施的重要挑战。

Conclusion: 该综述全面分类和评估了LLM在遗传疾病诊断和教育中的当前能力和局限，为这一快速发展的领域提供了导航指南，强调了从理论研究向临床实践转化的重要性。

Abstract: Although traditional statistical techniques and machine learning methods have
contributed significantly to genetics and, in particular, inherited disease
diagnosis, they often struggle with complex, high-dimensional data, a challenge
now addressed by state-of-the-art deep learning models. Large language models
(LLMs), based on transformer architectures, have excelled in tasks requiring
contextual comprehension of unstructured medical data. This systematic review
examines the role of LLMs in the genetic research and diagnostics of both rare
and common diseases. Automated keyword-based search in PubMed, bioRxiv,
medRxiv, and arXiv was conducted, targeting studies on LLM applications in
diagnostics and education within genetics and removing irrelevant or outdated
models. A total of 172 studies were analyzed, highlighting applications in
genomic variant identification, annotation, and interpretation, as well as
medical imaging advancements through vision transformers. Key findings indicate
that while transformer-based models significantly advance disease and risk
stratification, variant interpretation, medical imaging analysis, and report
generation, major challenges persist in integrating multimodal data (genomic
sequences, imaging, and clinical records) into unified and clinically robust
pipelines, facing limitations in generalizability and practical implementation
in clinical settings. This review provides a comprehensive classification and
assessment of the current capabilities and limitations of LLMs in transforming
hereditary disease diagnostics and supporting genetic education, serving as a
guide to navigate this rapidly evolving field.

Motivation: 神经网络在关键应用中常因不可预测的局部性能而影响可靠性，需要一种量化指标来测量局部值变化，提供稳定性和性能的洞察。

Method: 提出VC度量指标，研究其理论性质，发现VC趋势和少数趋势现象，并基于VC提出新的函数间距离度量和预处理框架。

Conclusion: VC指标能够有效表征神经网络逼近的局部性能，提出的预处理框架可以加速逼近过程，提高神经网络在关键应用中的可靠性。

Abstract: This paper introduce a novel metric of an objective function f, we say VC
(value change) to measure the difficulty and approximation affection when
conducting an neural network approximation task, and it numerically supports
characterizing the local performance and behavior of neural network
approximation. Neural networks often suffer from unpredictable local
performance, which can hinder their reliability in critical applications. VC
addresses this issue by providing a quantifiable measure of local value changes
in network behavior, offering insights into the stability and performance for
achieving the neural-network approximation. We investigate some fundamental
theoretical properties of VC and identified two intriguing phenomena in neural
network approximation: the VC-tendency and the minority-tendency. These trends
respectively characterize how pointwise errors evolve in relation to the
distribution of VC during the approximation process.In addition, we propose a
novel metric based on VC, which measures the distance between two functions
from the perspective of variation. Building upon this metric, we further
propose a new preprocessing framework for neural network approximation.
Numerical results including the real-world experiment and the PDE-related
scientific problem support our discovery and pre-processing acceleration
method.

*Shihao Zhang,Rayan Saab*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Beacon是一种无需手动调优的逐通道后训练量化算法，通过利用对称标量量化的几何特性自动确定最优缩放因子，在保持简单性的同时达到与最先进方法竞争的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的逐通道后训练量化方法通常需要通过启发式调优或网格搜索来固定缩放因子，这个过程需要手动操作且效率低下。

Method: Beacon使用固定的非缩放字母表直接执行逐通道PTQ，通过利用对称标量量化的几何特性自动确定最优缩放因子，支持对称和非对称量化，不依赖反向传播或大型校准集。

Result: 尽管算法简单且无需调优，Beacon在性能上与最先进的量化方法相当。

Conclusion: Beacon提供了一种实用的高效模型部署解决方案，消除了手动调优的需求，同时保持了竞争性的性能表现。

Abstract: Quantization is a widely used compression technique for reducing the memory
and computation costs of large pre-trained models. A key challenge in
per-channel post-training quantization (PTQ) is selecting appropriate scaling
factors to replace weight values with values from a scaled quantization grid.
Existing methods typically fix the scale at the outset via heuristic tuning or
grid search. In this note, we propose Beacon, a simple and effective algorithm
that eliminates the need for such manual tuning. Beacon performs per-channel
PTQ directly using a fixed non-scaled alphabet and automatically determines the
optimal scaling factors by exploiting the geometry of symmetric scalar
quantization. It supports both symmetric and asymmetric quantization with
minimal modifications and does not rely on back-propagation or large
calibration sets. Despite its simplicity and tuning-free nature, Beacon
achieves competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art methods, making
it a practical solution for efficient model deployment.

TL;DR: DALI是一个在Dreamer架构中集成的新框架，通过自监督编码器从智能体-环境交互中推断潜在上下文表示，实现零样本泛化到未见过的环境变化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现实世界强化学习中需要适应未见环境条件而不需要昂贵重新训练的问题，现有方法需要显式上下文变量，限制了在上下文潜在或难以测量时的使用。

Method: 在Dreamer架构中集成DALI框架，训练自监督编码器预测前向动态，生成可操作的表示来调节世界模型和策略，连接感知和控制。

Result: 在具有挑战性的cMDP基准测试中，DALI相比上下文无关基线取得显著提升，在推断任务中经常超越上下文感知基线，实现零样本泛化到未见上下文变化。

Conclusion: DALI通过潜在空间实现反事实一致性，理论证明编码器对高效上下文推断和鲁棒泛化至关重要，为处理潜在上下文提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Real-world reinforcement learning demands adaptation to unseen environmental
conditions without costly retraining. Contextual Markov Decision Processes
(cMDP) model this challenge, but existing methods often require explicit
context variables (e.g., friction, gravity), limiting their use when contexts
are latent or hard to measure. We introduce Dynamics-Aligned Latent Imagination
(DALI), a framework integrated within the Dreamer architecture that infers
latent context representations from agent-environment interactions. By training
a self-supervised encoder to predict forward dynamics, DALI generates
actionable representations conditioning the world model and policy, bridging
perception and control. We theoretically prove this encoder is essential for
efficient context inference and robust generalization. DALI's latent space
enables counterfactual consistency: Perturbing a gravity-encoding dimension
alters imagined rollouts in physically plausible ways. On challenging cMDP
benchmarks, DALI achieves significant gains over context-unaware baselines,
often surpassing context-aware baselines in extrapolation tasks, enabling
zero-shot generalization to unseen contextual variations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统PEFT方法在联邦学习中面临客户端数据分布、模型能力和计算资源的异构性挑战，ReFT虽然有效但直接应用于FL时存在聚合不匹配问题

Method: FedReFT在客户端应用稀疏干预层直接引导隐藏表示，提出All-But-Me聚合策略，每个客户端接收其他客户端的聚合更新并部分整合，平衡本地专注和全局知识

Result: 在常识推理、算术推理、指令调优和GLUE基准测试中，FedReFT持续优于最先进的PEFT方法，相比基于LoRA的方法实现了7-15倍的参数效率提升

Conclusion: FedReFT为联邦学习提供了一种轻量级且语义丰富的微调替代方案，通过表示级干预和创新的聚合策略有效解决了FL环境中的异构性挑战

Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) has attracted significant attention
for adapting large pre-trained models by modifying a small subset of
parameters. Recently, Representation Fine-tuning (ReFT) has emerged as an
effective alternative. ReFT shifts the fine-tuning paradigm from updating model
weights to directly manipulating hidden representations that capture rich
semantic information, and performs better than state-of-the-art PEFTs in
standalone settings. However, its application in Federated Learning (FL)
remains challenging due to heterogeneity in clients' data distributions, model
capacities, and computational resources. To address these challenges, we
introduce Federated Representation Fine-Tuning (FedReFT), a novel approach to
fine-tune the client's hidden representation. FedReFT applies sparse
intervention layers to steer hidden representations directly, offering a
lightweight and semantically rich fine-tuning alternative ideal for edge
devices. However, representation-level updates are especially vulnerable to
aggregation mismatch under different task heterogeneity, where naive averaging
can corrupt semantic alignment. To mitigate this issue, we propose All-But-Me
(ABM) aggregation, where each client receives the aggregated updates of others
and partially incorporates them, enabling stable and personalized learning by
balancing local focus with global knowledge. We evaluate FedReFT on commonsense
reasoning, arithmetic reasoning, instruction-tuning, and GLUE, where it
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art PEFT methods in FL, achieving 7x-15x
higher parameter efficiency compared to leading LoRA-based approaches.

Abstract: The growing complexity of urban mobility and the demand for efficient,
sustainable, and adaptive solutions have positioned Intelligent Transportation
Systems (ITS) at the forefront of modern infrastructure innovation. At the core
of ITS lies the challenge of autonomous decision-making across dynamic, large
scale, and uncertain environments where multiple agents traffic signals,
autonomous vehicles, or fleet units must coordinate effectively. Multi Agent
Reinforcement Learning (MARL) offers a promising paradigm for addressing these
challenges by enabling distributed agents to jointly learn optimal strategies
that balance individual objectives with system wide efficiency. This paper
presents a comprehensive survey of MARL applications in ITS. We introduce a
structured taxonomy that categorizes MARL approaches according to coordination
models and learning algorithms, spanning value based, policy based, actor
critic, and communication enhanced frameworks. Applications are reviewed across
key ITS domains, including traffic signal control, connected and autonomous
vehicle coordination, logistics optimization, and mobility on demand systems.
Furthermore, we highlight widely used simulation platforms such as SUMO, CARLA,
and CityFlow that support MARL experimentation, along with emerging benchmarks.
The survey also identifies core challenges, including scalability, non
stationarity, credit assignment, communication constraints, and the sim to real
transfer gap, which continue to hinder real world deployment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统内部人才推荐方法存在结构性局限性，依赖少数管理者视角宽视合格候选人，需要更全面的量化框架

Method: 从邮件数据建模员工职位适配的两个维度：任务内容（WHAT）和合作模式（HOW），构建独立图表征并使用门控机制双图卷积网络进行自适应融合

Result: 模型在Hit@100指标上达到40.9%的顶级性能，显著超过其他融合策略和基准方法，具有高可解释性

Conclusion: 该研究提供了一种量化且全面的内部人才发现框架，能够实证确定任务对齐和合作模式之间的最优融合比例，有重要的实践意义

Abstract: Internal talent recommendation is a critical strategy for organizational
continuity, yet conventional approaches suffer from structural limitations,
often overlooking qualified candidates by relying on the narrow perspective of
a few managers. To address this challenge, we propose a novel framework that
models two distinct dimensions of an employee's position fit from email data:
WHAT they do (semantic similarity of tasks) and HOW they work (structural
characteristics of their interactions and collaborations). These dimensions are
represented as independent graphs and adaptively fused using a Dual Graph
Convolutional Network (GCN) with a gating mechanism. Experiments show that our
proposed gating-based fusion model significantly outperforms other fusion
strategies and a heuristic baseline, achieving a top performance of 40.9% on
Hit@100. Importantly, it is worth noting that the model demonstrates high
interpretability by learning distinct, context-aware fusion strategies for
different job families. For example, it learned to prioritize relational (HOW)
data for 'sales and marketing' job families while applying a balanced approach
for 'research' job families. This research offers a quantitative and
comprehensive framework for internal talent discovery, minimizing the risk of
candidate omission inherent in traditional methods. Its primary contribution
lies in its ability to empirically determine the optimal fusion ratio between
task alignment (WHAT) and collaborative patterns (HOW), which is required for
employees to succeed in the new positions, thereby offering important practical
implications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于学习的方法需要为每个问题分布训练专用模型，计算成本高且泛化能力有限，需要一种通用的预训练方法来提高可扩展性和泛化性。

Method: 使用向量量化图自编码器在大量混合整数规划实例上进行无监督预训练，通过离散代码分配创建表示优化实例的词汇表。

Result: Forge嵌入能有效区分和聚类未见实例，单个模型可预测变量预热和割生成的完整性间隙，显著提升商业优化求解器性能。

Conclusion: Forge提供了一种有效的MIP实例级嵌入方法，实现了跨问题类型的通用表示学习，为优化问题的学习加速提供了新途径。

Abstract: Combinatorial optimization problems are ubiquitous in science and
engineering, yet learning-based approaches to accelerate their solution often
require solving a large number of hard-to-solve optimization instances to
collect training data, incurring significant computational overhead. Existing
methods require training dedicated models for each problem distribution for
each downstream task, severely limiting their scalability and generalization.
In this work, we introduce Forge, a method of pre-training a vector-quantized
graph autoencoder on a large and diverse collection of mixed-integer
programming (MIP) instances in an unsupervised fashion without dependency on
their solution. The vector quantization process creates discrete code
assignments that act as a vocabulary to represent optimization instances. We
evaluate our approach under both supervised and unsupervised settings. For the
unsupervised setting, we demonstrate that Forge embeddings effectively
differentiate and cluster unseen instances. For the supervised setting, we
fine-tune Forge embeddings and show that a single model predicts both the
variables for warm-starts and integrality gaps for cut-generation across
multiple problem type distributions. Both predictions help improve performance
of a state-of-the-art, commercial optimization solver. Finally, we release our
code and pre-trained Forge weights to encourage further research and practical
use of instance-level MIP embeddings at https://github.com/skadio/forge/

Motivation: 在两边市场中准确评估地理层面的营销效果常遇到挑战：SCM方法虽然效果强大但系统性低估效果大小，而DML方法缺乏与SCM的直接对比。

Method: 建立了一个开放、全面文档化的模拟器，模拟大规模地理测试。评估七种估计器：三种ASC变种咄四种面板DML方法，在五种历练测试场景下进行100次重复模拟。

Result: 在包含非线性或外部冲击的挑战性场景中，ASC模型呈现出严重偏差咄近零的覆盖率。相比之下，面板DML变种显著减少了偏差并恢复了名义95%置信区间覆盖率，显示出更好的稳健性。

Conclusion: 虽然ASC提供了简单的基准方法，但在常见的复杂情况下并不可靠。研究建议采用"先诊断后选择"框架，先识别主要的业务挑战，然后选择最适合该场景的特定DML模型，为地理实验分析提供更稳健可靠的方案。

Abstract: Accurately quantifying geo-level marketing lift in two-sided marketplaces is
challenging: the Synthetic Control Method (SCM) often exhibits high power yet
systematically under-estimates effect size, while panel-style Double Machine
Learning (DML) is seldom benchmarked against SCM. We build an open, fully
documented simulator that mimics a typical large-scale geo roll-out: N_unit
regional markets are tracked for T_pre weeks before launch and for a further
T_post-week campaign window, allowing all key parameters to be varied by the
user and probe both families under five stylized stress tests: 1) curved
baseline trends, 2) heterogeneous response lags, 3) treated-biased shocks, 4) a
non-linear outcome link, and 5) a drifting control group trend.
  Seven estimators are evaluated: three standard Augmented SCM (ASC) variants
and four panel-DML flavors (TWFE, CRE/Mundlak, first-difference, and
within-group). Across 100 replications per scenario, ASC models consistently
demonstrate severe bias and near-zero coverage in challenging scenarios
involving nonlinearities or external shocks. By contrast, panel-DML variants
dramatically reduce this bias and restore nominal 95%-CI coverage, proving far
more robust.
  The results indicate that while ASC provides a simple baseline, it is
unreliable in common, complex situations. We therefore propose a
'diagnose-first' framework where practitioners first identify the primary
business challenge (e.g., nonlinear trends, response lags) and then select the
specific DML model best suited for that scenario, providing a more robust and
reliable blueprint for analyzing geo-experiments.

Motivation: 传统EEG机器学习使用固定时间片段分割方法缺乏生物学相关性，因为大脑状态不局限于固定时间间隔，需要更符合生理特征的自适应分割方法

Method: 开发了CTXSEG自适应分割方法，基于EEG数据的统计差异创建变长片段，并使用CTXGEN信号生成器生成可控合成数据进行评估，在癫痫检测问题上验证方法有效性

Result: 使用CTXSEG预处理EEG数据在标准化框架下相比固定长度方法提高了癫痫检测性能，且需要更少的数据片段，无需修改机器学习方法

Conclusion: CTXSEG自适应分割可轻松应用于现代机器学习方法，有望改善性能，是EEG机器学习应用中信号预处理的有前景的替代方案，应纳入标准预处理流程

Abstract: Objective. Electroencephalography (EEG) data is derived by sampling
continuous neurological time series signals. In order to prepare EEG signals
for machine learning, the signal must be divided into manageable segments. The
current naive approach uses arbitrary fixed time slices, which may have limited
biological relevance because brain states are not confined to fixed intervals.
We investigate whether adaptive segmentation methods are beneficial for machine
learning EEG analysis.
  Approach. We introduce a novel adaptive segmentation method, CTXSEG, that
creates variable-length segments based on statistical differences in the EEG
data and propose ways to use them with modern machine learning approaches that
typically require fixed-length input. We assess CTXSEG using controllable
synthetic data generated by our novel signal generator CTXGEN. While our CTXSEG
method has general utility, we validate it on a real-world use case by applying
it to an EEG seizure detection problem. We compare the performance of CTXSEG
with fixed-length segmentation in the preprocessing step of a typical EEG
machine learning pipeline for seizure detection.
  Main results. We found that using CTXSEG to prepare EEG data improves seizure
detection performance compared to fixed-length approaches when evaluated using
a standardized framework, without modifying the machine learning method, and
requires fewer segments.
  Significance. This work demonstrates that adaptive segmentation with CTXSEG
can be readily applied to modern machine learning approaches, with potential to
improve performance. It is a promising alternative to fixed-length segmentation
for signal preprocessing and should be considered as part of the standard
preprocessing repertoire in EEG machine learning applications.

Motivation: 理解神经网络在过参数化矩阵分解问题中，梯度流算法在小初始化条件下表现出的增量学习现象（按奇异值降序学习目标矩阵）的理论机制。

Method: 使用对称矩阵分解问题的闭式解，通过求解Riccati类矩阵微分方程，分析梯度流动态中的时间尺度分离现象。

Result: 发现增量学习行为源于学习目标矩阵不同分量时的时间尺度分离，减小初始化规模会增强这种分离，从而能够找到目标矩阵的低秩近似。

Conclusion: 为理解梯度流在矩阵分解中的增量学习提供了定量分析框架，并讨论了将该分析扩展到非对称矩阵分解问题的可能途径。

Abstract: Many theoretical studies on neural networks attribute their excellent
empirical performance to the implicit bias or regularization induced by
first-order optimization algorithms when training networks under certain
initialization assumptions. One example is the incremental learning phenomenon
in gradient flow (GF) on an overparamerterized matrix factorization problem
with small initialization: GF learns a target matrix by sequentially learning
its singular values in decreasing order of magnitude over time. In this paper,
we develop a quantitative understanding of this incremental learning behavior
for GF on the symmetric matrix factorization problem, using its closed-form
solution obtained by solving a Riccati-like matrix differential equation. We
show that incremental learning emerges from some time-scale separation among
dynamics corresponding to learning different components in the target matrix.
By decreasing the initialization scale, these time-scale separations become
more prominent, allowing one to find low-rank approximations of the target
matrix. Lastly, we discuss the possible avenues for extending this analysis to
asymmetric matrix factorization problems.

Conclusion: DFAMS框架通过动态信息流分析有效解决了复杂联邦检索场景中的查询意图识别和跨域语义对齐问题，显著提升了检索性能

Abstract: Federated Retrieval (FR) routes queries across multiple external knowledge
sources, to mitigate hallucinations of LLMs, when necessary external knowledge
is distributed. However, existing methods struggle to retrieve high-quality and
relevant documents for ambiguous queries, especially in cross-domain scenarios,
which significantly limits their effectiveness in supporting downstream
generation tasks. Inspired by dynamic information flow (DIF), we propose DFAMS,
a novel framework that leverages DIF to identify latent query intents and
construct semantically aligned knowledge partitions for accurate retrieval
across heterogeneous sources. Specifically, DFAMS probes the DIF in LLMs by
leveraging gradient signals from a few annotated queries and employing Shapley
value-based attribution to trace neuron activation paths associated with intent
recognition and subdomain boundary detection. Then, DFAMS leverages DIF to
train an alignment module via multi-prototype contrastive learning, enabling
fine-grained intra-source modeling and inter-source semantic alignment across
knowledge bases. Experimental results across five benchmarks show that DFAMS
outperforms advanced FR methods by up to 14.37% in knowledge classification
accuracy, 5.38% in retrieval recall, and 6.45% in downstream QA accuracy,
demonstrating its effectiveness in complex FR scenarios.

Motivation: 解决设计师在评估引擎罩框架几何性能时需要大量时间进行模拟设置的问题，提高工程设计流程效率。

Method: 提出多模态机器学习(MMML)架构，从同一数据的不同模态中学习来预测性能指标，并使用未见过的框架几何进行预测验证。

Conclusion: MMML有潜力补充传统的基于模拟的工作流程，特别是在概念设计阶段，为机器学习在工程设计中更广泛应用铺平道路。

Abstract: Is there a way for a designer to evaluate the performance of a given hood
frame geometry without spending significant time on simulation setup? This
paper seeks to address this challenge by developing a multimodal
machine-learning (MMML) architecture that learns from different modalities of
the same data to predict performance metrics. It also aims to use the MMML
architecture to enhance the efficiency of engineering design processes by
reducing reliance on computationally expensive simulations. The proposed
architecture accelerates design exploration, enabling rapid iteration while
maintaining high-performance standards, especially in the concept design phase.
The study also presents results that show that by combining multiple data
modalities, MMML outperforms traditional single-modality approaches. Two new
frame geometries, not part of the training dataset, are also used for
prediction using the trained MMML model to showcase the ability to generalize

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Airbnb开发了BiListing方法，通过大语言模型和预训练语言-图像模型对齐文本和照片，将多样化的非结构化数据整合为单一嵌入向量，提升了搜索排名效果并带来显著收入增长。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Airbnb面临将多样化的非结构化数据（多张图片、标题、描述、评论等）整合为单一表示的挑战，传统结构化数据方法已无法满足需求，需要利用表示学习技术从文本和图像中提取丰富信息。

Result: 通过离线和在线测试，将BiListing嵌入应用于Airbnb搜索排名模型并成功部署到生产环境，实现了0.425%的NDCG增益，带来了数千万美元的增量收入。

Conclusion: BiListing方法有效解决了多模态数据整合的挑战，提供了用户友好的语义搜索能力，克服了冷启动问题，并在实际业务中证明了其价值和效果。

Abstract: Airbnb is a leader in offering travel accommodations. Airbnb has historically
relied on structured data to understand, rank, and recommend listings to guests
due to the limited capabilities and associated complexity arising from
extracting meaningful information from text and images. With the rise of
representation learning, leveraging rich information from text and photos has
become easier. A popular approach has been to create embeddings for text
documents and images to enable use cases of computing similarities between
listings or using embeddings as features in an ML model.
  However, an Airbnb listing has diverse unstructured data: multiple images,
various unstructured text documents such as title, description, and reviews,
making this approach challenging. Specifically, it is a non-trivial task to
combine multiple embeddings of different pieces of information to reach a
single representation.
  This paper proposes BiListing, for Bimodal Listing, an approach to align text
and photos of a listing by leveraging large-language models and pretrained
language-image models. The BiListing approach has several favorable
characteristics: capturing unstructured data into a single embedding vector per
listing and modality, enabling zero-shot capability to search inventory
efficiently in user-friendly semantics, overcoming the cold start problem, and
enabling listing-to-listing search along a single modality, or both.
  We conducted offline and online tests to leverage the BiListing embeddings in
the Airbnb search ranking model, and successfully deployed it in production,
achieved 0.425% of NDCB gain, and drove tens of millions in incremental
revenue.

TL;DR: 提出了TF-TransUNet1D模型，结合U-Net编码器-解码器和Transformer编码器，使用混合时频域损失函数进行ECG信号去噪，在SNR和误差指标上优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ECG信号作为心脏数字孪生的基础数据源，其诊断价值常被噪声和伪影影响，需要开发有效的去噪方法来保持信号的诊断完整性。

Method: 提出TF-TransUNet1D一维深度神经网络，集成U-Net编码器-解码器架构和Transformer编码器，采用双域损失函数同时优化时域波形重建和频域谱保真度。

Result: 在MIT-BIH心律失常数据库和NSTDB上的实验显示，模型在SNR改善和误差指标上均优于最先进基线，达到平均绝对误差0.1285和皮尔逊相关系数0.9540。

Conclusion: 该工作通过提供高精度去噪，填补了心脏数字孪生预处理流程的关键空白，实现了更可靠的实时监测和个性化建模。

Abstract: Electrocardiogram (ECG) signals serve as a foundational data source for
cardiac digital twins, yet their diagnostic utility is frequently compromised
by noise and artifacts. To address this issue, we propose TF-TransUNet1D, a
novel one-dimensional deep neural network that integrates a U-Net-based
encoder-decoder architecture with a Transformer encoder, guided by a hybrid
time-frequency domain loss. The model is designed to simultaneously capture
local morphological features and long-range temporal dependencies, which are
critical for preserving the diagnostic integrity of ECG signals. To enhance
denoising robustness, we introduce a dual-domain loss function that jointly
optimizes waveform reconstruction in the time domain and spectral fidelity in
the frequency domain. In particular, the frequency-domain component effectively
suppresses high-frequency noise while maintaining the spectral structure of the
signal, enabling recovery of subtle but clinically significant waveform
components. We evaluate TF-TransUNet1D using synthetically corrupted signals
from the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database and the Noise Stress Test Database
(NSTDB). Comparative experiments against state-of-the-art baselines demonstrate
consistent superiority of our model in terms of SNR improvement and error
metrics, achieving a mean absolute error of 0.1285 and Pearson correlation
coefficient of 0.9540. By delivering high-precision denoising, this work
bridges a critical gap in pre-processing pipelines for cardiac digital twins,
enabling more reliable real-time monitoring and personalized modeling.

TL;DR: TLinFormer是一种新型线性注意力架构，通过重新配置神经元连接模式，在保持精确注意力计算的同时实现严格线性复杂度，解决了Transformer二次复杂度瓶颈问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer的自注意力机制存在二次复杂度瓶颈，限制了其在长序列任务中的应用。现有线性注意力方法通常通过数据无关的核近似或受限上下文选择来牺牲模型性能。

Method: 从连接主义的第一原理出发，基于信息流的拓扑结构，重新配置神经元连接模式，构建TLinFormer架构，实现严格线性复杂度同时计算精确注意力分数。

Result: 实验表明TLinFormer在推理延迟、KV缓存效率、内存占用和整体加速等关键指标上表现出压倒性优势。

Conclusion: TLinFormer成功解决了Transformer的复杂度瓶颈问题，在保持性能的同时实现了线性复杂度，为长序列处理提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: The Transformer architecture has become a cornerstone of modern artificial
intelligence, but its core self-attention mechanism suffers from a complexity
bottleneck that scales quadratically with sequence length, severely limiting
its application in long-sequence tasks. To address this challenge, existing
linear attention methods typically sacrifice model performance by relying on
data-agnostic kernel approximations or restrictive context selection. This
paper returns to the first principles of connectionism, starting from the
topological structure of information flow, to introduce a novel linear
attention architecture-\textbf{TLinFormer}. By reconfiguring neuron connection
patterns, TLinFormer achieves strict linear complexity while computing exact
attention scores and ensuring information flow remains aware of the full
historical context. This design aims to bridge the performance gap prevalent
between existing efficient attention methods and standard attention. Through a
series of experiments, we systematically evaluate the performance of TLinFormer
against a standard Transformer baseline on long-sequence inference tasks. The
results demonstrate that TLinFormer exhibits overwhelming advantages in key
metrics such as \textbf{inference latency}, \textbf{KV cache efficiency},
\textbf{memory footprint}, and \textbf{overall speedup}.

Abstract: One aim of dimensionality reduction is to discover the main factors that
explain the data, and as such is paramount to many applications. When working
with high dimensional data, autoencoders offer a simple yet effective approach
to learn low-dimensional representations. The two components of a general
autoencoder consist first of an encoder that maps the observed data onto a
latent space; and second a decoder that maps the latent space back to the
original observation space, which allows to learn a low-dimensional manifold
representation of the original data. In this article, we introduce a new type
of geometric regularization for decoding maps approximated by deep neural
networks, namely nonlinear conformal regularization. This regularization
procedure permits local variations of the decoder map and comes with a new
scalar field called conformal factor which acts as a quantitative indicator of
the amount of local deformation sustained by the latent space when mapped into
the original data space. We also show that this regularization technique allows
the computation of the scalar curvature of the learned manifold. Implementation
and experiments on the Swiss roll and CelebA datasets are performed to
illustrate how to obtain these quantities from the architecture.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该研究结合传统可解释AI方法和评级驱动解释(RDE)来评估时间序列预测模型在不同领域的性能和可解释性，发现特征工程模型在波动性大的领域表现优于基础模型，而基础模型仅在稳定趋势驱动的场景中表现更好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 时间序列预测模型在实际应用中越来越重要，但用户难以理解模型为何成功或失败，存在严重的可解释性问题，需要评估模型性能和可解释性以帮助用户更好地依赖模型输出。

Method: 结合传统可解释AI(XAI)方法和评级驱动解释(RDE)，评估了四种模型架构(ARIMA、梯度提升、Chronos时间序列基础模型、Llama通用基础模型)在金融、能源、交通和汽车销售四个领域的表现。

Result: 特征工程模型(如梯度提升)在波动性或稀疏领域(如电力、汽车零部件)始终优于基础模型(如Chronos)，且提供更可解释的说明；基础模型仅在稳定或趋势驱动的场景(如金融)中表现优异。

Conclusion: 时间序列预测模型的选择应基于具体应用场景的特性，特征工程模型在复杂波动环境中更具优势且更可解释，而基础模型更适合稳定趋势预测场景。

Abstract: Time-series forecasting models (TSFM) have evolved from classical statistical
methods to sophisticated foundation models, yet understanding why and when
these models succeed or fail remains challenging. Despite this known
limitation, time series forecasting models are increasingly used to generate
information that informs real-world actions with equally real consequences.
Understanding the complexity, performance variability, and opaque nature of
these models then becomes a valuable endeavor to combat serious concerns about
how users should interact with and rely on these models' outputs. This work
addresses these concerns by combining traditional explainable AI (XAI) methods
with Rating Driven Explanations (RDE) to assess TSFM performance and
interpretability across diverse domains and use cases. We evaluate four
distinct model architectures: ARIMA, Gradient Boosting, Chronos (time-series
specific foundation model), Llama (general-purpose; both fine-tuned and base
models) on four heterogeneous datasets spanning finance, energy,
transportation, and automotive sales domains. In doing so, we demonstrate that
feature-engineered models (e.g., Gradient Boosting) consistently outperform
foundation models (e.g., Chronos) in volatile or sparse domains (e.g., power,
car parts) while providing more interpretable explanations, whereas foundation
models excel only in stable or trend-driven contexts (e.g., finance).

TL;DR: 本文研究了状态空间模型(SSM)对角初始化方案，从频率角度分析学习偏差，提出了基于离散傅里叶域的对角初始化方法S4D-DFouT，在长序列基准测试中达到SOTA效果


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前SSM参数初始化主要依赖HiPPO框架，虽然对角变体在性能相当的同时计算效率更高，但HiPPO框架未明确研究对角变体的作用，需要从频率角度系统理解对角状态空间模型的学习偏差

Method: 从频率角度研究对角SSM初始化方案，分析参数化方法和学习偏差，提出基于离散傅里叶域的对角初始化方法S4D-DFouT，并研究极点放置的作用

Result: 提出的S4D-DFouT方法在Long Range Arena基准测试中达到state-of-the-art结果，能够在PathX-256等大型数据集上从头训练

Conclusion: 通过频率角度分析对角SSM初始化，提出的S4D-DFouT方法有效提升了模型性能，极点放置的见解有助于进一步扩展模型规模

Abstract: Current methods for initializing state space models (SSMs) parameters mainly
rely on the \textit{HiPPO framework}, which is based on an online approximation
of orthogonal polynomials. Recently, diagonal alternatives have shown to reach
a similar level of performance while being significantly more efficient due to
the simplification in the kernel computation. However, the \textit{HiPPO
framework} does not explicitly study the role of its diagonal variants. In this
paper, we take a further step to investigate the role of diagonal SSM
initialization schemes from the frequency perspective. Our work seeks to
systematically understand how to parameterize these models and uncover the
learning biases inherent in such diagonal state-space models. Based on our
observations, we propose a diagonal initialization on the discrete Fourier
domain \textit{S4D-DFouT}. The insights in the role of pole placing in the
initialization enable us to further scale them and achieve state-of-the-art
results on the Long Range Arena benchmark, allowing us to train from scratch on
very large datasets as PathX-256.

TL;DR: EAGLE-PC是一种新的机器学习遗忘框架，通过嵌入空间相似性测量和ICL生成的代理约束，实现了更精确的遗忘边界，在保持模型效用的同时有效移除特定数据影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型训练数据可能包含隐私或版权内容，现有遗忘方法缺乏明确的遗忘边界，导致部分样本遗忘不足（残留泄漏风险）或过度遗忘（牺牲模型效用）。

Method: 提出EAGLE-PC框架，包含两个核心组件：1）基于嵌入空间相似性的纠缠感知损失重加权，确定每个样本的遗忘力度；2）利用ICL生成测试数据的代理约束，软正则化遗忘过程防止过度遗忘。

Result: 在TOFU和MUSE基准测试中，EAGLE-PC在多个LLM上均显示出遗忘-效用权衡的一致改进，结合NPO+GD优化器可接近完全重新训练的性能。

Conclusion: EAGLE-PC提供了一个可扩展且鲁棒的遗忘解决方案，可作为即插即用的增强模块与现有基于梯度的目标兼容。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are trained on massive datasets that may include
private or copyrighted content. Due to growing privacy and ownership concerns,
data owners may request the removal of their data from trained models. Machine
unlearning provides a practical solution by removing the influence of specific
data without full retraining. However, most existing methods lack a sound
forgetting boundary, causing some samples to be under-forgotten, leaving
residual leakage risks, while others remain over-forgotten at the expense of
degraded utility.
  In this work, we propose EAGLE-PC (Entanglement-Awareness Guided Loss
Reweighting with Proxy Constraint), a novel unlearning framework that addresses
these limitations through two key components. First, entanglement-awareness
guided loss reweighting determines the forgetting effort of each sample by
measuring its similarity to retain samples in the embedding space, enabling
more targeted and effective unlearning. Second, a proxy constraint leveraging
ICL (In-Context Learning) generated test data softly regularizes the forgetting
process, effectively mitigating over-forgetting. EAGLE-PC is compatible with
existing gradient-based objectives and serves as a plug-and-play enhancement.
We evaluate EAGLE-PC on the TOFU and MUSE benchmarks, showing consistent
improvements in the forgetting-utility trade-off across multiple LLMs. Combined
with the NPO+GD optimizer, it approaches full retraining performance, offering
a scalable and robust unlearning solution.

Abstract: Generative AI offers transformative potential for high-stakes domains such as
healthcare and finance, yet privacy and regulatory barriers hinder the use of
real-world data. To address this, differentially private synthetic data
generation has emerged as a promising alternative. In this work, we introduce a
unified benchmark to systematically evaluate the utility and fidelity of text
datasets generated under formal Differential Privacy (DP) guarantees. Our
benchmark addresses key challenges in domain-specific benchmarking, including
choice of representative data and realistic privacy budgets, accounting for
pre-training and a variety of evaluation metrics. We assess state-of-the-art
privacy-preserving generation methods across five domain-specific datasets,
revealing significant utility and fidelity degradation compared to real data,
especially under strict privacy constraints. These findings underscore the
limitations of current approaches, outline the need for advanced
privacy-preserving data sharing methods and set a precedent regarding their
evaluation in realistic scenarios.

Result: 在真实世界EHR数据集上的实验表明，SHGT在诊断预测任务上优于现有最先进模型

Conclusion: SHGT框架通过超图结构和Transformer的有效结合，成功解决了EHR数据中高阶依赖关系建模的挑战

Abstract: Electronic Health Records (EHR) systematically organize patient health data
through standardized medical codes, serving as a comprehensive and invaluable
source for predictive modeling. Graph neural networks (GNNs) have demonstrated
effectiveness in modeling interactions between medical codes within EHR.
However, existing GNN-based methods are inadequate due to: a) their reliance on
pairwise relations fails to capture the inherent higher-order dependencies in
clinical data, and b) the localized message-passing scheme limits
representation power. To address these issues, this paper proposes a novel
Structure-aware HyperGraph Transformer (SHGT) framework following three-fold
ideas: a) employing a hypergraph structural encoder to capture higher-order
interactions among medical codes, b) integrating the Transformer architecture
to reason over the entire hypergraph, and c) designing a tailored loss function
incorporating hypergraph reconstruction to preserve the hypergraph's original
structure. Experiments on real-world EHR datasets demonstrate that the proposed
SHGT outperforms existing state-of-the-art models on diagnosis prediction.

TL;DR: MedGR²是一个创新的医疗视觉语言模型框架，通过生成式奖励学习创建自我改进的数据生成和奖励模型循环，解决了医疗领域高质量标注数据稀缺的问题，显著提升了跨模态和跨任务的泛化性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医疗视觉语言模型应用受到高质量专家标注数据稀缺的严重限制。传统监督微调在未见模态和任务上泛化能力差，而强化学习又缺乏可靠的奖励信号。需要突破数据稀缺的瓶颈。

Method: 提出MedGR²框架，协同开发数据生成器和奖励模型，实现自动化、持续生成高质量多模态医疗数据。这些数据既用于监督微调，也用于通过组相对策略优化(GRPO)进行强化学习。

Result: 使用MedGR²生成数据进行监督微调已超越基于大规模人工标注数据集的基线方法。结合GRPO进行强化学习后，在跨模态和跨任务泛化方面达到最先进水平，显著优于专门的基于强化学习的方法。紧凑模型性能可与参数量10倍以上的基础模型相媲美。

Conclusion: MedGR²为高风险领域的高效学习提供了新范式，将问题从数据稀缺转变为数据生成，释放了强化学习在构建真正可泛化医疗AI方面的全部潜力。

Abstract: The application of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) in medicine is critically
hampered by the scarcity of high-quality, expert-annotated data. Supervised
Fine-Tuning (SFT) on existing datasets often leads to poor generalization on
unseen modalities and tasks, while Reinforcement Learning (RL), a promising
alternative, is stymied by the lack of reliable reward signals in this
data-scarce domain. To break this impasse, we introduce Generative Reward
Learning for Medical Reasoning (MedGR$^2$), a novel framework that creates a
self-improving virtuous cycle. MedGR$^2$ co-develops a data generator and a
reward model, enabling the automated, continuous creation of high-quality,
multi-modal medical data that serves as both a superior training source for SFT
and RL. Our experiments demonstrate that SFT with MedGR$^2$-produced data
already surpasses baselines trained on large-scale, human-curated datasets.
Crucially, when leveraging this data for RL via Group Relative Policy
Optimization (GRPO), our model achieves state-of-the-art cross-modality and
cross-task generalization, significantly outperforming specialized RL-based
methods. Furthermore, our compact model, empowered by MedGR$^2$, achieves
performance competitive with foundation models possessing over 10 times more
parameters. MedGR$^2$ presents a new paradigm for data-efficient learning in
high-stakes domains, transforming the problem from data scarcity to data
generation and unlocking the full potential of RL for building truly
generalizable medical AI.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MERIT是一种新颖的优化器，通过最大范数和逐元素信任比来解决大批次训练中注意力层的信息瓶颈问题，显著提升训练稳定性和批次大小。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有优化器（如AdamW、LAMB）在大批次训练语言模型时存在性能下降问题，主要原因是注意力层中最大注意力对数急剧增加导致的信息瓶颈，以及LAMB中基于l2范数的信任比无法有效约束查询/键权重的最大值。

Method: 提出MERIT优化器：1）使用最大范数计算信任比来更有效地约束最大注意力对数；2）构建逐元素信任比，通过关注局部权重结构提供更稳健的更新缩放。

Result: 在各种规模的GPT-2模型上进行大量实验，MERIT表现出优越性能。在GPT-2 Medium训练中，MERIT支持6k批次大小（相比标准480批次）且无性能下降，使用48B训练token。

Conclusion: 该工作强调了大批次训练中考虑最大注意力对数和更细粒度信任比的重要性，成功提高了训练稳定性，为使用更大批次、加速大语言模型开发和迭代铺平了道路。

Abstract: Large-batch training has become a cornerstone in accelerating the training of
deep neural networks, yet it poses challenges in optimization and
generalization. Existing optimizers like AdamW present performance degradation
during language models' large-batch training, due to the information bottleneck
in attention layers caused by the sharp increase of max attention logit. While
the LAMB optimizer partially addresses this issue, some attention layers still
face this issue. The reason is that $l_2$-norm-based trust ratios in LAMB are
less effective in directly influencing the max value of query/key weights.
Furthermore, the weight-wise trust ratio in LAMB is error-prone as it overlooks
relationships of weight values within rows or columns. Building on these
observations, we propose a novel optimizer, MERIT, which leverages the max-norm
to calculate the trust ratio to constrain the max attention logit more
effectively. Moreover, we further construct element-wise trust ratios to
provide more robust update scaling by focusing on local weight structures.
Extensive experiments of large-batch training across various sizes of GPT-2
models demonstrate the superior performance of MERIT. Notably, during the
training of GPT-2 Medium, MERIT enables a 6k batch size without any performance
degradation compared to the standard batch size (480) with 48B training tokens.
This work highlights the importance of considering the max attention logit and
finer-granularity trust ratio in large-batch training. It successfully improves
the training stability and paves the way for larger batch usage, enabling
faster development and iteration of large language models. Code is available at

Method: 基于有限维RKHS核函数的精确随机推理算法，可扩展到无限维RKHS但需要牺牲精确性

Result: 在内存资源限制批次大小和诱导点数量的情况下，实验结果显示优于现有方法

Conclusion: 该方法为高斯过程超参数学习提供了更可靠的精确推理方案，特别适用于资源受限场景

Abstract: Current methods for stochastic hyperparameter learning in Gaussian Processes
(GPs) rely on approximations, such as computing biased stochastic gradients or
using inducing points in stochastic variational inference. However, when using
such methods we are not guaranteed to converge to a stationary point of the
true marginal likelihood. In this work, we propose algorithms for exact
stochastic inference of GPs with kernels that induce a Reproducing Kernel
Hilbert Space (RKHS) of moderate finite dimension. Our approach can also be
extended to infinite dimensional RKHSs at the cost of forgoing exactness. Both
for finite and infinite dimensional RKHSs, our method achieves better
experimental results than existing methods when memory resources limit the
feasible batch size and the possible number of inducing points.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 图神经网络在处理长距离依赖关系任务时遇到过度压缩问题，存在信息瓶颈。现有的图重新连线和添加虚拟节点方法会改变原始图的全局拓扑结构，影响域知识编码。

Result: 在标准数据集上的实验表明，LVN能够提升结构连通性，并在图分类和节点分类任务上显著提高性能。

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效缓解过度压缩问题，同时最大程度保留原始图结构的全局特征，为图神经网络处理长距离依赖关系提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Over-squashing is a challenge in training graph neural networks for tasks
involving long-range dependencies. In such tasks, a GNN's receptive field
should be large enough to enable communication between distant nodes. However,
gathering information from a wide range of neighborhoods and squashing its
content into fixed-size node representations makes message-passing vulnerable
to bottlenecks. Graph rewiring and adding virtual nodes are commonly studied
remedies that create additional pathways around bottlenecks to mitigate
over-squashing. However, these techniques alter the input graph's global
topology and disrupt the domain knowledge encoded in the original graph
structure, both of which could be essential to specific tasks and domains. This
study presents Local Virtual Nodes (LVN) with trainable embeddings to alleviate
the effects of over-squashing without significantly corrupting the global
structure of the input graph. The position of the LVNs is determined by the
node centrality, which indicates the existence of potential bottlenecks. Thus,
the proposed approach aims to improve the connectivity in the regions with
likely bottlenecks. Furthermore, trainable LVN embeddings shared across
selected central regions facilitate communication between distant nodes without
adding more layers. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate
that LVNs can enhance structural connectivity and significantly improve
performance on graph and node classification tasks. The code can be found at

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于任务的调查数据可信度评估方法，通过模型特定的距离度量来验证样本调查是否可信代表总体，算法样本复杂度与数据维度无关。

Motivation: 传统的高维分布距离估计需要样本量随维度指数增长，但实际数据分析中，不同分布下的结论可能一致，需要更高效的可信度评估方法。

Method: 设计了回归模型背景下的调查数据可信度验证算法，引入模型特定的距离度量，专注于验证数据可信度而非重建回归模型。

Result: 算法样本复杂度与数据维度无关，相比重建回归模型的方法（样本复杂度随维度线性增长）更高效，理论正确性得到证明并通过数值实验验证。

Conclusion: 任务导向的方法能有效评估调查数据可信度，避免了高维分布估计的维度灾难问题，为调查数据质量验证提供了实用工具。

Abstract: Assessing whether a sample survey credibly represents the population is a
critical question for ensuring the validity of downstream research. Generally,
this problem reduces to estimating the distance between two high-dimensional
distributions, which typically requires a number of samples that grows
exponentially with the dimension. However, depending on the model used for data
analysis, the conclusions drawn from the data may remain consistent across
different underlying distributions. In this context, we propose a task-based
approach to assess the credibility of sampled surveys. Specifically, we
introduce a model-specific distance metric to quantify this notion of
credibility. We also design an algorithm to verify the credibility of survey
data in the context of regression models. Notably, the sample complexity of our
algorithm is independent of the data dimension. This efficiency stems from the
fact that the algorithm focuses on verifying the credibility of the survey data
rather than reconstructing the underlying regression model. Furthermore, we
show that if one attempts to verify credibility by reconstructing the
regression model, the sample complexity scales linearly with the dimensionality
of the data. We prove the theoretical correctness of our algorithm and
numerically demonstrate our algorithm's performance.

Abstract: We develop a stochastic algorithm for independent component analysis that
incorporates multi-trial supervision, which is available in many scientific
contexts. The method blends a proximal gradient-type algorithm in the space of
invertible matrices with joint learning of a prediction model through
backpropagation. We illustrate the proposed algorithm on synthetic and real
data experiments. In particular, owing to the additional supervision, we
observe an increased success rate of the non-convex optimization and the
improved interpretability of the independent components.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 超声信号在工业无损检测和结构健康监测中至关重要，但标注数据稀缺且信号处理任务特定性强，需要探索自监督学习方法

Method: 采用MAE与Vision Transformer架构，在未标注的合成超声信号上进行预训练，系统研究了模型大小、补丁大小和掩码比例对预训练效率和下游准确性的影响

Conclusion: 该研究强调了MAEs通过可扩展的自监督学习在推进超声信号分析方面的潜力

Abstract: We investigated the adaptation and performance of Masked Autoencoders (MAEs)
with Vision Transformer (ViT) architectures for self-supervised representation
learning on one-dimensional (1D) ultrasound signals. Although MAEs have
demonstrated significant success in computer vision and other domains, their
use for 1D signal analysis, especially for raw ultrasound data, remains largely
unexplored. Ultrasound signals are vital in industrial applications such as
non-destructive testing (NDT) and structural health monitoring (SHM), where
labeled data are often scarce and signal processing is highly task-specific. We
propose an approach that leverages MAE to pre-train on unlabeled synthetic
ultrasound signals, enabling the model to learn robust representations that
enhance performance in downstream tasks, such as time-of-flight (ToF)
classification. This study systematically investigated the impact of model
size, patch size, and masking ratio on pre-training efficiency and downstream
accuracy. Our results show that pre-trained models significantly outperform
models trained from scratch and strong convolutional neural network (CNN)
baselines optimized for the downstream task. Additionally, pre-training on
synthetic data demonstrates superior transferability to real-world measured
signals compared with training solely on limited real datasets. This study
underscores the potential of MAEs for advancing ultrasound signal analysis
through scalable, self-supervised learning.

Method: 开发GDS代理，提供全面的图算法工具集，结合预处理和后处理功能，构建模型上下文协议(MCP)服务器，可与任何现代LLM即插即用。

Result: GDS代理能够解决广泛的图任务，新基准测试显示其在中间工具调用和最终响应方面表现良好，但也存在一些挑战场景。

Conclusion: GDS代理显著提升了LLM处理图数据的能力，但仍面临一些挑战，需要进一步的技术发展和路线图规划。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable multimodal information
processing and reasoning ability. When equipped with tools through function
calling and enhanced with retrieval-augmented techniques, compound LLM-based
systems can access closed data sources and answer questions about them.
However, they still struggle to process and reason over large-scale
graph-structure data. We introduce the GDS (Graph Data Science) agent in this
technical report. The GDS agent introduces a comprehensive set of graph
algorithms as tools, together with preprocessing (retrieval) and postprocessing
of algorithm results, in a model context protocol (MCP) server. The server can
be used with any modern LLM out-of-the-box. GDS agent allows users to ask any
question that implicitly and intrinsically requires graph algorithmic reasoning
about their data, and quickly obtain accurate and grounded answers. We also
introduce a new benchmark that evaluates intermediate tool calls as well as
final responses. The results indicate that GDS agent is able to solve a wide
spectrum of graph tasks. We also provide detailed case studies for more
open-ended tasks and study scenarios where the agent struggles. Finally, we
discuss the remaining challenges and the future roadmap.

Motivation: 现有扩散蒸馏方法使用学生模型的分数函数近似梯度，但由于去噪分数匹配训练不完美，梯度估计存在偏差，导致性能次优。

Method: 提出VarDiU（变分扩散上界），构建无偏梯度估计器，直接应用于扩散蒸馏过程。

Result: 与Diff-Instruct相比，VarDiU实现了更高的生成质量，训练过程更高效稳定。

Conclusion: VarDiU通过无偏梯度估计解决了扩散蒸馏中的偏差问题，显著提升了一步扩散蒸馏的性能。

Abstract: Recently, diffusion distillation methods have compressed thousand-step
teacher diffusion models into one-step student generators while preserving
sample quality. Most existing approaches train the student model using a
diffusive divergence whose gradient is approximated via the student's score
function, learned through denoising score matching (DSM). Since DSM training is
imperfect, the resulting gradient estimate is inevitably biased, leading to
sub-optimal performance. In this paper, we propose VarDiU (pronounced
/va:rdju:/), a Variational Diffusive Upper Bound that admits an unbiased
gradient estimator and can be directly applied to diffusion distillation. Using
this objective, we compare our method with Diff-Instruct and demonstrate that
it achieves higher generation quality and enables a more efficient and stable
training procedure for one-step diffusion distillation.

Abstract: In this work, we propose a novel framework to enhance the efficiency and
accuracy of neural operators through self-composition, offering both
theoretical guarantees and practical benefits. Inspired by iterative methods in
solving numerical partial differential equations (PDEs), we design a specific
neural operator by repeatedly applying a single neural operator block, we
progressively deepen the model without explicitly adding new blocks, improving
the model's capacity. To train these models efficiently, we introduce an
adaptive train-and-unroll approach, where the depth of the neural operator is
gradually increased during training. This approach reveals an accuracy scaling
law with model depth and offers significant computational savings through our
adaptive training strategy. Our architecture achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA)
performance on standard benchmarks. We further demonstrate its efficacy on a
challenging high-frequency ultrasound computed tomography (USCT) problem, where
a multigrid-inspired backbone enables superior performance in resolving complex
wave phenomena. The proposed framework provides a computationally tractable,
accurate, and scalable solution for large-scale data-driven scientific machine
learning applications.

Result: 实验结果显示，使用组合性合成数据训练的模型在测试集上的表现与使用原始数据训练相当，而且在SOFA分数预测任务中，使用合成数据训练的模型性能显著超过使用原始数据训练的模型。

Conclusion: 通过探索时间序列的组合性结构，可以有效生成高质量的合成临床数据，不仅能够深化对数据生成机制的理解，还能实际解决临床数据稀缩问题，为临床预测提供更好的数据支持。

Abstract: This work investigates whether time series of natural phenomena can be
understood as being generated by sequences of latent states which are ordered
in systematic and regular ways. We focus on clinical time series and ask
whether clinical measurements can be interpreted as being generated by
meaningful physiological states whose succession follows systematic principles.
Uncovering the underlying compositional structure will allow us to create
synthetic data to alleviate the notorious problem of sparse and low-resource
data settings in clinical time series forecasting, and deepen our understanding
of clinical data. We start by conceptualizing compositionality for time series
as a property of the data generation process, and then study data-driven
procedures that can reconstruct the elementary states and composition rules of
this process. We evaluate the success of this methods using two empirical tests
originating from a domain adaptation perspective. Both tests infer the
similarity of the original time series distribution and the synthetic time
series distribution from the similarity of expected risk of time series
forecasting models trained and tested on original and synthesized data in
specific ways. Our experimental results show that the test set performance
achieved by training on compositionally synthesized data is comparable to
training on original clinical time series data, and that evaluation of models
on compositionally synthesized test data shows similar results to evaluating on
original test data, outperforming randomization-based data augmentation. An
additional downstream evaluation of the prediction task of sequential organ
failure assessment (SOFA) scores shows significant performance gains when model
training is entirely based on compositionally synthesized data compared to
training on original data.

Motivation: 随着大语言模型能力增强，恶意微调风险增加。现有研究主要关注SFT攻击，但RL攻击可能更具威胁性，需要专门防御机制。

Method: 提出TokenBuncher防御系统，采用熵作为奖励的RL方法和Token Noiser机制，通过约束模型响应不确定性来防止RL有害微调。

Result: 在多个模型和RL算法上的实验表明，TokenBuncher能有效缓解有害RL微调，同时保持良性任务效用和微调能力。

Conclusion: RL有害微调比SFT具有更大系统性风险，TokenBuncher提供了有效且通用的防御解决方案。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) continue to grow in capability, so do the
risks of harmful misuse through fine-tuning. While most prior studies assume
that attackers rely on supervised fine-tuning (SFT) for such misuse, we
systematically demonstrate that reinforcement learning (RL) enables adversaries
to more effectively break safety alignment and facilitate advanced harmful task
assistance, under matched computational budgets. To counter this emerging
threat, we propose TokenBuncher, the first effective defense specifically
targeting RL-based harmful fine-tuning. TokenBuncher suppresses the foundation
on which RL relies: model response uncertainty. By constraining uncertainty,
RL-based fine-tuning can no longer exploit distinct reward signals to drive the
model toward harmful behaviors. We realize this defense through
entropy-as-reward RL and a Token Noiser mechanism designed to prevent the
escalation of expert-domain harmful capabilities. Extensive experiments across
multiple models and RL algorithms show that TokenBuncher robustly mitigates
harmful RL fine-tuning while preserving benign task utility and finetunability.
Our results highlight that RL-based harmful fine-tuning poses a greater
systemic risk than SFT, and that TokenBuncher provides an effective and general
defense.

Conclusion: EEGDM通过扩散模型实现了强大的EEG表示学习能力，具有良好的泛化性和实用价值。

Abstract: While electroencephalography (EEG) signal analysis using deep learning has
shown great promise, existing approaches still face significant challenges in
learning generalizable representations that perform well across diverse tasks,
particularly when training data is limited. Current EEG representation learning
methods including EEGPT and LaBraM typically rely on simple masked
reconstruction objective, which may not fully capture the rich semantic
information and complex patterns inherent in EEG signals. In this paper, we
propose EEGDM, a novel self-supervised EEG representation learning method based
on the latent diffusion model, which leverages EEG signal generation as a
self-supervised objective, turning the diffusion model into a strong
representation learner capable of capturing EEG semantics. EEGDM incorporates
an EEG encoder that distills EEG signals and their channel augmentations into a
compact representation, acting as conditional information to guide the
diffusion model for generating EEG signals. This design endows EEGDM with a
compact latent space, which not only offers ample control over the generative
process but also can be leveraged for downstream tasks. Experimental results
show that EEGDM (1) can reconstruct high-quality EEG signals, (2) effectively
learns robust representations, and (3) achieves competitive performance with
modest pre-training data size across diverse downstream tasks, underscoring its
generalizability and practical utility.

Conclusion: 研究为工具增强工作流程提供了理论和实证基础，证明其不仅实用，而且在可扩展性方面具有可证明的优势。

Abstract: Tool-augmented language models, equipped with retrieval, memory, or external
APIs, are reshaping AI, yet their theoretical advantages remain underexplored.
In this paper, we address this question by demonstrating the benefits of
in-tool learning (external retrieval) over in-weight learning (memorization)
for factual recall. We show that the number of facts a model can memorize
solely in its weights is fundamentally limited by its parameter count. In
contrast, we prove that tool-use enables unbounded factual recall via a simple
and efficient circuit construction. These results are validated in controlled
experiments, where tool-using models consistently outperform memorizing ones.
We further show that for pretrained large language models, teaching tool-use
and general rules is more effective than finetuning facts into memory. Our work
provides both a theoretical and empirical foundation, establishing why
tool-augmented workflows are not just practical, but provably more scalable.

Abstract: We introduce SAFEMax, a novel method for Machine Unlearning in diffusion

Conclusion: LLM引导的课程学习和多样性上下文混合机制为多智能体强化学习提供了更鲁棒的训练和评估方法

Abstract: Many multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) algorithms are trained in
fixed simulation environments, making them brittle when deployed in real-world
scenarios with more complex and uncertain conditions. Contextual MARL (cMARL)
addresses this by parameterizing environments with context variables and
training a context-agnostic policy that performs well across all environment
configurations. Existing cMARL methods attempt to use curriculum learning to
help train and evaluate context-agnostic policies, but they often rely on
unreliable proxy signals, such as value estimates or generalized advantage
estimates that are noisy and unstable in multi-agent settings due to
inter-agent dynamics and partial observability. To address these issues, we
propose Contextual Multi-Agent LLM-Guided Curriculum Learning with
Diversity-Based Context Blending (cMALC-D), a framework that uses Large
Language Models (LLMs) to generate semantically meaningful curricula and
provide a more robust evaluation signal. To prevent mode collapse and encourage
exploration, we introduce a novel diversity-based context blending mechanism
that creates new training scenarios by combining features from prior contexts.
Experiments in traffic signal control domains demonstrate that cMALC-D
significantly improves both generalization and sample efficiency compared to
existing curriculum learning baselines. We provide code at

methods often rely on sequential encoder-decoder structures that cause high
computational costs and parameter requirements, limiting scalability and
efficiency. To address these limitations, we propose a novel framework that
accomplishes automated feature transformation through four steps:
transformation records collection, embedding space construction with a revised
Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) model, gradient-ascent search, and
autoregressive reconstruction. In our approach, the revised GPT model serves
two primary functions: (a) feature transformation sequence reconstruction and
(b) model performance estimation and enhancement for downstream tasks by
constructing the embedding space. Such a multi-objective optimization framework
reduces parameter size and accelerates transformation processes. Experimental
results on benchmark datasets show that the proposed framework matches or
exceeds baseline performance, with significant gains in computational
efficiency. This work highlights the potential of transformer-based
architectures for scalable, high-performance automated feature transformation.

Method: 提出ATM-GAD模型，包含时间motif提取器将交易历史压缩为信息丰富的motif，双重注意力块（IntraA和InterA）分析motif内和motif间交互，以及可微分自适应时间窗口学习器为每个节点定制观察窗口

Conclusion: ATM-GAD通过有效利用时间motif和自适应时间窗口，成功解决了金融欺诈检测中的时间相关挑战，为复杂金融系统中的异常检测提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Financial fraud detection is essential to safeguard billions of dollars, yet
the intertwined entities and fast-changing transaction behaviors in modern
financial systems routinely defeat conventional machine learning models. Recent
graph-based detectors make headway by representing transactions as networks,
but they still overlook two fraud hallmarks rooted in time: (1) temporal
motifs--recurring, telltale subgraphs that reveal suspicious money flows as
they unfold--and (2) account-specific intervals of anomalous activity, when
fraud surfaces only in short bursts unique to each entity. To exploit both
signals, we introduce ATM-GAD, an adaptive graph neural network that leverages
temporal motifs for financial anomaly detection. A Temporal Motif Extractor
condenses each account's transaction history into the most informative motifs,
preserving both topology and temporal patterns. These motifs are then analyzed
by dual-attention blocks: IntraA reasons over interactions within a single
motif, while InterA aggregates evidence across motifs to expose multi-step
fraud schemes. In parallel, a differentiable Adaptive Time-Window Learner
tailors the observation window for every node, allowing the model to focus
precisely on the most revealing time slices. Experiments on four real-world
datasets show that ATM-GAD consistently outperforms seven strong
anomaly-detection baselines, uncovering fraud patterns missed by earlier
methods.

Abstract: The Internet of Things (IoT) is ubiquitous thanks to the rapid development of
wireless technologies. However, the broadcast nature of wireless transmissions
results in great vulnerability to device authentication. Physical layer
authentication emerges as a promising approach by exploiting the unique channel
characteristics. However, a practical scheme applicable to dynamic channel
variations is still missing. In this paper, we proposed a deep learning-based
physical layer channel state information (CSI) authentication for mobile
scenarios and carried out comprehensive simulation and experimental evaluation
using IEEE 802.11n. Specifically, a synthetic training dataset was generated
based on the WLAN TGn channel model and the autocorrelation and the distance
correlation of the channel, which can significantly reduce the overhead of
manually collecting experimental datasets. A convolutional neural network
(CNN)-based Siamese network was exploited to learn the temporal and spatial
correlation between the CSI pair and output a score to measure their
similarity. We adopted a synergistic methodology involving both simulation and
experimental evaluation. The experimental testbed consisted of WiFi IoT
development kits and a few typical scenarios were specifically considered. Both
simulation and experimental evaluation demonstrated excellent generalization
performance of our proposed deep learning-based approach and excellent
authentication performance. Demonstrated by our practical measurement results,
our proposed scheme improved the area under the curve (AUC) by 0.03 compared to
the fully connected network-based (FCN-based) Siamese model and by 0.06
compared to the correlation-based benchmark algorithm.

Motivation: 解决量子力学轨迹数据集分散、格式不一致、难以获取的问题，这些数据集虽然生成成本高但难以整合使用，限制了机器学习间势的发展。

Method: 从Materials Project、Alexandria和OQMD等大型存储库中聚合数据，标准化数据表示，协调结果，并过滤高质量构型，覆盖PBE、PBESol、SCAN、r2SCAN等常用DFT泛函。

Conclusion: LeMat-Traj提供了一个标准化的大规模材料数据集，LeMaterial-Fetcher库为社区提供了可复现的框架，支持新数据源的集成和大规模材料数据集的持续发展。

Abstract: The development of accurate machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs)
is limited by the fragmented availability and inconsistent formatting of
quantum mechanical trajectory datasets derived from Density Functional Theory
(DFT). These datasets are expensive to generate yet difficult to combine due to
variations in format, metadata, and accessibility. To address this, we
introduce LeMat-Traj, a curated dataset comprising over 120 million atomic
configurations aggregated from large-scale repositories, including the
Materials Project, Alexandria, and OQMD. LeMat-Traj standardizes data
representation, harmonizes results and filters for high-quality configurations
across widely used DFT functionals (PBE, PBESol, SCAN, r2SCAN). It
significantly lowers the barrier for training transferrable and accurate MLIPs.
LeMat-Traj spans both relaxed low-energy states and high-energy, high-force
structures, complementing molecular dynamics and active learning datasets. By
fine-tuning models pre-trained on high-force data with LeMat-Traj, we achieve a
significant reduction in force prediction errors on relaxation tasks. We also
present LeMaterial-Fetcher, a modular and extensible open-source library
developed for this work, designed to provide a reproducible framework for the
community to easily incorporate new data sources and ensure the continued
evolution of large-scale materials datasets. LeMat-Traj and LeMaterial-Fetcher

Abstract: While foundation models have revolutionized such fields as natural language
processing and computer vision, their application and potential within graph
machine learning remain largely unexplored. One of the key challenges in
designing graph foundation models (GFMs) is handling diverse node features that
can vary across different graph datasets. Although many works on GFMs have been
focused exclusively on text-attributed graphs, the problem of handling
arbitrary features of other types in GFMs has not been fully addressed.
However, this problem is not unique to the graph domain, as it also arises in
the field of machine learning for tabular data. In this work, motivated by the
recent success of tabular foundation models like TabPFNv2, we propose G2T-FM, a
simple graph foundation model that employs TabPFNv2 as a backbone.
Specifically, G2T-FM augments the original node features with neighborhood
feature aggregation, adds structural embeddings, and then applies TabPFNv2 to
the constructed node representations. Even in a fully in-context regime, our
model achieves strong results, significantly outperforming publicly available
GFMs and performing on par with well-tuned GNNs trained from scratch. Moreover,
after finetuning, G2T-FM surpasses well-tuned GNN baselines, highlighting the
potential of the proposed approach. More broadly, our paper reveals a
previously overlooked direction of utilizing tabular foundation models for
graph machine learning tasks.

Abstract: We study a sequential resource allocation problem where a decision maker
selects subsets of agents at each period to maximize overall outcomes without
prior knowledge of individual-level effects. Our framework applies to settings
such as community health interventions, targeted digital advertising, and
workforce retention programs, where intervention effects evolve dynamically.
Agents may exhibit habituation (diminished response from frequent selection) or
recovery (enhanced response from infrequent selection). The technical challenge
centers on nonstationary reward distributions that lead to changing
intervention effects over time. The problem requires balancing two key
competing objectives: heterogeneous individual rewards and the
exploration-exploitation tradeoff in terms of learning for improved future
decisions as opposed to maximizing immediate outcomes. Our contribution
introduces the first framework incorporating this form of nonstationary rewards
in the combinatorial multi-armed bandit literature. We develop algorithms with
theoretical guarantees on dynamic regret and demonstrate practical efficacy
through a diabetes intervention case study. Our personalized community
intervention algorithm achieved up to three times as much improvement in
program enrollment compared to baseline approaches, validating the framework's
potential for real-world applications. This work bridges theoretical advances
in adaptive learning with practical challenges in population-level behavioral
change interventions.

Motivation: 传统采样规划器探索效率低，而学习式方法缺乏安全保证和泛化能力，需要结合两者优势

Method: 将扩散策略作为智能采样器指导RRT等采样规划器的状态空间搜索，结合扩散策略的复杂轨迹分布建模能力和采样规划器的完备性

Result: 在分布外场景中，DiTree比传统采样规划器快3倍，成功率比其他方法高30%

Conclusion: DiTree框架成功结合了学习方法和传统规划器的优势，实现了高效且安全的运动规划

Abstract: Kinodynamic motion planning is concerned with computing collision-free
trajectories while abiding by the robot's dynamic constraints. This critical
problem is often tackled using sampling-based planners (SBPs) that explore the
robot's high-dimensional state space by constructing a search tree via action
propagations. Although SBPs can offer global guarantees on completeness and
solution quality, their performance is often hindered by slow exploration due
to uninformed action sampling. Learning-based approaches can yield
significantly faster runtimes, yet they fail to generalize to
out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios and lack critical guarantees, e.g., safety,
thus limiting their deployment on physical robots. We present Diffusion Tree
(DiTree): a \emph{provably-generalizable} framework leveraging diffusion
policies (DPs) as informed samplers to efficiently guide state-space search
within SBPs. DiTree combines DP's ability to model complex distributions of
expert trajectories, conditioned on local observations, with the completeness
of SBPs to yield \emph{provably-safe} solutions within a few action propagation
iterations for complex dynamical systems. We demonstrate DiTree's power with an
implementation combining the popular RRT planner with a DP action sampler
trained on a \emph{single environment}. In comprehensive evaluations on OOD
scenarios, % DiTree has comparable runtimes to a standalone DP (3x faster than
classical SBPs), while improving the average success rate over DP and SBPs.
DiTree is on average 3x faster than classical SBPs, and outperforms all other
approaches by achieving roughly 30\% higher success rate. Project webpage:

Conclusion: InSQuAD通过同时关注质量和多样性，有效提升了上下文学习的性能，为ICL任务提供了新的解决方案

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce InSQuAD, designed to enhance the performance of
In-Context Learning (ICL) models through Submodular Mutual Information} (SMI)
enforcing Quality and Diversity among in-context exemplars. InSQuAD achieves
this through two principal strategies: First, we model the ICL task as a
targeted selection problem and introduce a unified selection strategy based on
SMIs which mines relevant yet diverse in-context examples encapsulating the
notions of quality and diversity. Secondly, we address a common pitfall in
existing retrieval models which model query relevance, often overlooking
diversity, critical for ICL. InSQuAD introduces a combinatorial training
paradigm which learns the parameters of an SMI function to enforce both quality
and diversity in the retrieval model through a novel likelihood-based loss. To
further aid the learning process we augment an existing multi-hop question
answering dataset with synthetically generated paraphrases. Adopting the
retrieval model trained using this strategy alongside the novel targeted
selection formulation for ICL on nine benchmark datasets shows significant
improvements validating the efficacy of our approach.

Abstract: Denoising-based generative models, particularly diffusion and flow matching
algorithms, have achieved remarkable success. However, aligning their output
distributions with complex downstream objectives, such as human preferences,
compositional accuracy, or data compressibility, remains challenging. While
reinforcement learning (RL) fine-tuning methods, inspired by advances in RL
from human feedback (RLHF) for large language models, have been adapted to
these generative frameworks, current RL approaches are suboptimal for diffusion
models and offer limited flexibility in controlling alignment strength after
fine-tuning. In this work, we reinterpret RL fine-tuning for diffusion models
through the lens of stochastic differential equations and implicit reward
conditioning. We introduce Reinforcement Learning Guidance (RLG), an
inference-time method that adapts Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) by combining
the outputs of the base and RL fine-tuned models via a geometric average. Our
theoretical analysis shows that RLG's guidance scale is mathematically
equivalent to adjusting the KL-regularization coefficient in standard RL
objectives, enabling dynamic control over the alignment-quality trade-off
without further training. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RLG
consistently improves the performance of RL fine-tuned models across various
architectures, RL algorithms, and downstream tasks, including human
preferences, compositional control, compressibility, and text rendering.
Furthermore, RLG supports both interpolation and extrapolation, thereby
offering unprecedented flexibility in controlling generative alignment. Our
approach provides a practical and theoretically sound solution for enhancing
and controlling diffusion model alignment at inference. The source code for RLG
is publicly available at the Github:

Conclusion: 研究结果表明随机线性代数工具能够揭示子采样与曲率感知优化策略之间的相互作用，为SNGD在最小二乘之外的有效性提供了首个理论解释。

Abstract: Subsampled natural gradient descent (SNGD) has shown impressive results for
parametric optimization tasks in scientific machine learning, such as neural
network wavefunctions and physics-informed neural networks, but it has lacked a
theoretical explanation. We address this gap by analyzing the convergence of
SNGD and its accelerated variant, SPRING, for idealized parametric optimization
problems where the model is linear and the loss function is strongly convex and
quadratic. In the special case of a least-squares loss, namely the standard
linear least-squares problem, we prove that SNGD is equivalent to a regularized
Kaczmarz method while SPRING is equivalent to an accelerated regularized
Kaczmarz method. As a result, by leveraging existing analyses we obtain under
mild conditions (i) the first fast convergence rate for SNGD, (ii) the first
convergence guarantee for SPRING in any setting, and (iii) the first proof that
SPRING can accelerate SNGD. In the case of a general strongly convex quadratic
loss, we extend the analysis of the regularized Kaczmarz method to obtain a
fast convergence rate for SNGD under stronger conditions, providing the first
explanation for the effectiveness of SNGD outside of the least-squares setting.
Overall, our results illustrate how tools from randomized linear algebra can
shed new light on the interplay between subsampling and curvature-aware
optimization strategies.

Abstract: Machine learning-based compact models provide a rapid and efficient approach
for estimating device behavior across multiple input parameter variations. In
this study, we introduce two reverse-design algorithms that utilize these
compact models to identify device parameters corresponding to desired

demonstrates a substantial reduction in computation time when employing machine
learning-based compact models compared to traditional phase-field methods,
underscoring a clear and substantial efficiency advantage. Additionally, the

Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of joint communication and sensing (JCAS)
in next-generation wireless networks, with an emphasis on in-band full-duplex
(IBFD) multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems. Traditionally,
self-interference (SI) in IBFD systems is a major obstacle to recovering the
signal of interest (SOI). Under the JCAS paradigm, however, this high-power SI
signal presents an opportunity for efficient sensing. Since each transceiver
node has access to the original SI signal, its environmental reflections can be
exploited to estimate channel conditions and detect changes, without requiring
dedicated radar waveforms. We propose a blind source separation (BSS)-based
framework to simultaneously perform self-interference cancellation (SIC) and
extract sensing information in IBFD MIMO settings. The approach applies the
Fast Independent Component Analysis (FastICA) algorithm to separate the SI and
SOI signals while enabling simultaneous signal recovery and channel estimation.
Simulation results confirm the framework's effectiveness, showing improved
sensing and communication performance as signal frame size increases.

Abstract: Resistive random-access memory (ReRAM) is a promising technology for
designing hardware accelerators for deep neural network (DNN) inferencing.
However, stochastic noise in ReRAM crossbars can degrade the DNN inferencing
accuracy. We propose the design and optimization of a high-performance,
area-and energy-efficient ReRAM-based hardware accelerator to achieve robust
DNN inferencing in the presence of stochastic noise. We make two key technical
contributions. First, we propose a stochastic-noise-aware training method,
referred to as ReSNA, to improve the accuracy of DNN inferencing on ReRAM
crossbars with stochastic noise. Second, we propose an information-theoretic
algorithm, referred to as CF-MESMO, to identify the Pareto set of solutions to
trade-off multiple objectives, including inferencing accuracy, area overhead,
execution time, and energy consumption. The main challenge in this context is
that executing the ReSNA method to evaluate each candidate ReRAM design is
prohibitive. To address this challenge, we utilize the continuous-fidelity
evaluation of ReRAM designs associated with prohibitive high computation cost
by varying the number of training epochs to trade-off accuracy and cost.
CF-MESMO iteratively selects the candidate ReRAM design and fidelity pair that
maximizes the information gained per unit computation cost about the optimal
Pareto front. Our experiments on benchmark DNNs show that the proposed
algorithms efficiently uncover high-quality Pareto fronts. On average, ReSNA
achieves 2.57% inferencing accuracy improvement for ResNet20 on the CIFAR-10
dataset with respect to the baseline configuration. Moreover, CF-MESMO
algorithm achieves 90.91% reduction in computation cost compared to the popular
multi-objective optimization algorithm NSGA-II to reach the best solution from
NSGA-II.

Abstract: Memory allocation, though constituting only a small portion of the executed
code, can have a "butterfly effect" on overall program performance, leading to
significant and far-reaching impacts. Despite accounting for just approximately
5% of total instructions, memory allocation can result in up to a 2.7x
performance variation depending on the allocator used. This effect arises from
the complexity of memory allocation in modern multi-threaded multi-core
systems, where allocator metadata becomes intertwined with user data, leading
to cache pollution or increased cross-thread synchronization overhead.
Offloading memory allocators to accelerators, e.g., Mallacc and Memento, is a
potential direction to improve the allocator performance and mitigate cache
pollution. However, these accelerators currently have limited support for
multi-threaded applications, and synchronization between cores and accelerators
remains a significant challenge.
  We present SpeedMalloc, using a lightweight support-core to process memory
allocation tasks in multi-threaded applications. The support-core is a
lightweight programmable processor with efficient cross-core data
synchronization and houses all allocator metadata in its own caches. This
design minimizes cache conflicts with user data and eliminates the need for
cross-core metadata synchronization. In addition, using a general-purpose core
instead of domain-specific accelerators makes SpeedMalloc capable of adopting
new allocator designs. We compare SpeedMalloc with state-of-the-art software
and hardware allocators, including Jemalloc, TCMalloc, Mimalloc, Mallacc, and
Memento. SpeedMalloc achieves 1.75x, 1.18x, 1.15x, 1.23x, and 1.18x speedups on
multithreaded workloads over these five allocators, respectively.

TL;DR: SwizzlePerf利用LLM实现硬件感知的GPU内核性能优化，自动生成空间优化模式，相比专家手动优化时间从2周缩短到5分钟，在10个内核中9个实现最高2.06倍加速


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于搜索的LLM性能优化方法缺乏硬件感知能力，而人类性能工程师依赖硬件特性进行优化。需要让LLM具备硬件意识来生成针对特定硬件的软件级优化

Method: 通过向LLM提供工作负载的内存访问模式、架构规格、过滤的性能日志和历史性能反思，使LLM具备硬件感知能力，自动为GPU内核生成空间优化模式

Result: GEMM内核优化时间从专家2周缩短到5分钟；10个ML和科学计算内核中9个实现优化，最高加速2.06倍，L2命中率提升70%

Conclusion: 这是首个系统化创建硬件感知LLM性能工程代理的工作，为未来硬件感知性能优化开辟了新方向

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown progress in GPU kernel performance
engineering using inefficient search-based methods that optimize around
runtime. Any existing approach lacks a key characteristic that human
performance engineers rely on for near-optimal utilization --
hardware-awareness. By leveraging the workload's specific memory access
patterns, architecture specifications, filtered profiling logs, and reflections
on historical performance, we can make software-level optimizations that are
tailored to the underlying hardware. SwizzlePerf automatically generates
spatial optimizations for GPU kernels on disaggregated architectures by giving
LLMs explicit hardware-awareness.
  For a GEMM kernel, SwizzlePerf takes less than 5 minutes to generate the same
hardware-specific optimal swizzling pattern that took expert performance
engineers 2 weeks to find. On a suite of 10 diverse ML and Science kernels,
SwizzlePerf can generate swizzling patterns for 9 of the kernels that achieve
up to a 2.06x speedup and 70% improvement in L2 hit rate. This work is the
first of many steps toward systematically creating hardware-aware LLM
performance engineering agents.

TL;DR: 提出了一种主机级控制器，通过动态MIG重配置、PCIe感知放置和轻量级防护措施，有效减少共享A100集群中PCIe干扰导致的尾部延迟和SLO违规问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 共享A100集群中PCIe结构的噪声邻居干扰会导致尾部延迟增加和SLO违规，影响延迟敏感型推理任务的性能。

Method: 使用动态多实例GPU重配置、PCIe感知的虚拟机放置策略，结合轻量级防护措施（MPS配额、cgroup I/O控制），通过采样租户尾部延迟和系统信号，利用拓扑提示避免PCIe热点，并采用停留/冷却机制防止操作抖动。

Result: 在单主机和2节点（16-GPU）集群上，SLO违规率降低约32%（约1.5倍），p99延迟改善约15%，吞吐量成本≤5%；在LLM服务评估中，TTFT p99改善10-15%，成本≤5%。

Conclusion: 该控制器能有效缓解PCIe干扰问题，MIG重配置和放置策略贡献相当，且无需修改控制器即可适用于LLM服务场景。

Abstract: Latency-sensitive inference on shared A100 clusters often suffers
noisy-neighbor interference on the PCIe fabric, inflating tail latency and SLO
violations. We present a fabric-agnostic, VM-deployable host-level controller
that combines dynamic Multi-Instance GPU (MIG) reconfiguration, PCIe-aware
placement, and lightweight guardrails (MPS quotas, cgroup I/O). It samples
per-tenant tails and system signals, uses topology hints to avoid PCIe hot
spots, and gates actions with dwell/cool-down to avoid thrash. On a single host
and a 2-node (16-GPU) cluster, SLO miss-rate is reduced by \(\approx\)32\%
(\(\approx\)1.5) and p99 latency improves \(\approx\)15\% with \(\leq\)5\%
throughput cost versus static MIG and naive placement; ablations show MIG and
placement contribute comparably. We also evaluate LLM serving with vLLM on OLMo
2 7B Instruct: TTFT p99 improves \(\approx\)10--15\% at \(\leq\)5\% cost
without changing the controller.

Conclusion: CoFormer系统有效解决了边缘设备上大型transformer模型部署的挑战，通过协作推理实现了性能、效率和资源消耗的良好平衡。

Abstract: The impressive performance of transformer models has sparked the deployment
of intelligent applications on resource-constrained edge devices. However,
ensuring high-quality service for real-time edge systems is a significant
challenge due to the considerable computational demands and resource
requirements of these models. Existing strategies typically either offload
transformer computations to other devices or directly deploy compressed models
on individual edge devices. These strategies, however, result in either
considerable communication overhead or suboptimal trade-offs between accuracy
and efficiency. To tackle these challenges, we propose a collaborative
inference system for general transformer models, termed CoFormer. The central
idea behind CoFormer is to exploit the divisibility and integrability of
transformer. An off-the-shelf large transformer can be decomposed into multiple
smaller models for distributed inference, and their intermediate results are
aggregated to generate the final output. We formulate an optimization problem
to minimize both inference latency and accuracy degradation under heterogeneous
hardware constraints. DeBo algorithm is proposed to first solve the
optimization problem to derive the decomposition policy, and then progressively
calibrate decomposed models to restore performance. We demonstrate the
capability to support a wide range of transformer models on heterogeneous edge
devices, achieving up to 3.1$\times$ inference speedup with large transformer
models. Notably, CoFormer enables the efficient inference of GPT2-XL with 1.6
billion parameters on edge devices, reducing memory requirements by 76.3\%.
CoFormer can also reduce energy consumption by approximately 40\% while
maintaining satisfactory inference performance.

TL;DR: 提出了pdGRASS并行算法，解决了现有feGRASS方法在并行化和偏斜输入上的问题，实现了3.9-8.8倍加速，并在稀疏器质量上表现更好


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有feGRASS方法存在两个主要问题：1）由于严格的数据依赖难以并行化恢复步骤；2）在偏斜输入上性能下降，通常需要多次遍历才能恢复足够的边

Method: 提出pdGRASS并行算法，将边组织成无数据依赖的独立子任务，实现高效并行化并在单次遍历中完成足够的边恢复

Result: pdGRASS实现了3.9-8.8倍的平均加速，稀疏器质量在PCG迭代次数上表现更好（1.2倍高至1.8倍低），最坏情况下比feGRASS快1000倍以上

Conclusion: pdGRASS在图谱稀疏化问题上显著提升了可扩展性和性能，解决了现有方法的并行化和偏斜输入处理问题

Abstract: Graph Spectral Sparsification (GSS) identifies an ultra-sparse subgraph, or
sparsifier, whose Laplacian matrix closely approximates the spectral properties
of the original graph, enabling substantial reductions in computational
complexity for computationally intensive problems in scientific computing. The
state-of-the-art method for efficient GSS is feGRASS, consisting of two steps:
1) spanning tree generation and 2) off-tree edge recovery. However, feGRASS
suffers from two main issues: 1) difficulties in parallelizing the recovery
step for strict data dependencies, and 2) performance degradation on skewed
inputs, often requiring multiple passes to recover sufficient edges. To address
these challenges, we propose parallel density-aware Graph Spectral
Sparsification (pdGRASS), a parallel algorithm that organizes edges into
disjoint subtasks without data dependencies between them, enabling efficient
parallelization and sufficient edge recovery in a single pass. We empirically
evaluate feGRASS and pdGRASS based on 1) off-tree edge-recovery runtime and 2)
sparsifier quality, measured by the iteration count required for convergence in
a preconditioned conjugate gradient (PCG) application. The evaluation
demonstrates that, depending on the number of edges recovered, pdGRASS achieves
average speedups ranging from 3.9x to 8.8x. The resulting sparsifiers also show
between 1.2x higher and 1.8x lower PCG iteration counts, with further
improvements as more edges are recovered. Additionally, pdGRASS mitigates the
worst-case runtimes of feGRASS with over 1000x speedup. These results highlight
pdGRASS's significant improvements in scalability and performance for the graph
spectral sparsification problem.

Abstract: This paper proposes an intelligent service optimization method based on a
multi-agent collaborative evolution mechanism to address governance challenges
in large-scale microservice architectures. These challenges include complex
service dependencies, dynamic topology structures, and fluctuating workloads.
The method models each service as an agent and introduces graph representation
learning to construct a service dependency graph. This enables agents to
perceive and embed structural changes within the system. Each agent learns its
policy based on a Markov Decision Process. A centralized training and
decentralized execution framework is used to integrate local autonomy with
global coordination. To enhance overall system performance and adaptability, a
game-driven policy optimization mechanism is designed. Through a
selection-mutation process, agent strategy distributions are dynamically
adjusted. This supports adaptive collaboration and behavioral evolution among
services. Under this mechanism, the system can quickly respond and achieve
stable policy convergence when facing scenarios such as sudden workload spikes,
topology reconfigurations, or resource conflicts. To evaluate the effectiveness
of the proposed method, experiments are conducted on a representative
microservice simulation platform. Comparative analyses are performed against
several advanced approaches, focusing on coordination efficiency, adaptability,
and policy convergence performance. Experimental results show that the proposed
method outperforms others in several key metrics. It significantly improves
governance efficiency and operational stability in large-scale microservice
systems. The method demonstrates strong practical value and engineering
feasibility.
