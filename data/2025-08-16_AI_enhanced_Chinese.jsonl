As\nmodel complexity grows, accelerator design spaces have expanded to O(10^17),\nbecoming highly irregular, non-convex, and exhibiting many-to-one mappings from\ndesign configurations to performance metrics. This complexity renders direct\ninverse derivation infeasible and necessitates heuristic or sampling-based\noptimization. Conventional methods - including Bayesian optimization, gradient\ndescent, reinforcement learning, and genetic algorithms - depend on iterative\nsampling, resulting in long runtimes and sensitivity to initialization. Deep\nlearning-based approaches have reframed DSE as classification using\nrecommendation models, but remain limited to small-scale (O(10^3)), less\ncomplex design spaces. To overcome these constraints, we propose a generative\napproach that models hardware design as 1-D image synthesis conditioned on\ntarget performance, enabling efficient learning of non-differentiable,\nnon-bijective hardware-performance mappings. Our framework achieves 0.86% lower\ngeneration error than Bayesian optimization with a 17000x speedup, and\noutperforms GANDSE with 30% lower error at only 1.83x slower search. We further\nextend the method to a structured DSE setting, attaining 9.8% lower\nenergy-delay product (EDP) and 6% higher performance, with up to 145.6x and\n1312x faster search compared to existing optimization methods on O(10^17)\ndesign spaces.

The PEARL study was the first large-scale, four-arm\nrandomized controlled trial to assess a reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm,\ninformed by health behavior change theory, to personalize the content and\ntiming of PA nudges via a Fitbit app.\n  We enrolled and randomized 13,463 Fitbit users into four study arms: control,\nrandom, fixed, and RL. The control arm received no nudges. The other three arms\nreceived nudges from a bank of 155 nudges based on behavioral science\nprinciples. The random arm received nudges selected at random. The fixed arm\nreceived nudges based on a pre-set logic from survey responses about PA\nbarriers. The RL group received nudges selected by an adaptive RL algorithm. We\nincluded 7,711 participants in primary analyses (mean age 42.1, 86.3% female,\nbaseline steps 5,618.2).\n  We observed an increase in PA for the RL group compared to all other groups\nfrom baseline to 1 and 2 months. The RL group had significantly increased\naverage daily step count at 1 month compared to all other groups: control (+296\nsteps, p=0.0002), random (+218 steps, p=0.005), and fixed (+238 steps,\np=0.002).

Experiments on time series models typically focus on\ndemonstrating improvements in forecast accuracy over existing/baseline\nsolutions, quantified according to some accuracy metric. There is no doubt that\nforecast accuracy is important; however in production systems, demand planners\noften value consistency and stability over incremental accuracy improvements.\nAssuming that the inputs have not changed significantly, forecasts that vary\ndrastically from one planning cycle to the next require high amounts of human\nintervention, which frustrates demand planners and can even cause them to lose\ntrust in ML forecasting models. We study model-induced stochasticity, which\nquantifies the variance of a set of forecasts produced by a single model when\nthe set of inputs is fixed. Models with lower variance are more stable.\n  Recently the forecasting community has seen significant advances in forecast\naccuracy through the development of deep machine learning models for time\nseries forecasting.

Many practical applications of LLMs, such as code completion and\nstructured data extraction, require adherence to syntactic constraints\nspecified by a formal language. Yet, due to their probabilistic nature, LLM\noutput is not guaranteed to adhere to such formal languages. Prior work has\nproposed constrained decoding as a means to restrict LLM generation to\nparticular formal languages. However, existing works are not applicable to the\nemerging paradigm of diffusion LLMs, when used in practical scenarios such as\nthe generation of formally correct C++ or JSON output. In this paper we address\nthis challenge and present the first constrained decoding method for diffusion\nmodels, one that can handle formal languages captured by context-free grammars.\nWe begin by reducing constrained decoding to the more general additive\ninfilling problem, which asks whether a partial output can be completed to a\nvalid word in the target language. This problem also naturally subsumes the\npreviously unaddressed multi-region infilling constrained decoding. We then\nreduce this problem to the task of deciding whether the intersection of the\ntarget language and a regular language is empty and present an efficient\nalgorithm to solve it for context-free languages. Empirical results on various\napplications, such as C++ code infilling and structured data extraction in\nJSON, demonstrate that our method achieves near-perfect syntactic correctness\nwhile consistently preserving or improving functional correctness.

Here, we present an AI-driven pipeline for extracting\nand analyzing handwritten markings on seized elephant tusks, offering a novel,\nscalable, and low-cost source of forensic evidence. Having collected 6,085\nphotographs from eight large seizures of ivory over a 6-year period\n(2014-2019), we used an object detection model to extract over 17,000\nindividual markings, which were then labeled and described using\nstate-of-the-art AI tools. We identified 184 recurring \"signature markings\"\nthat connect the tusks on which they appear. 20 signature markings were\nobserved in multiple seizures, establishing forensic links between these\nseizures through traffickers involved in both shipments. This work complements\nother investigative techniques by filling in gaps where other data sources are\nunavailable. The study demonstrates the transformative potential of AI in\nwildlife forensics and highlights practical steps for integrating handwriting\nanalysis into efforts to disrupt organized wildlife crime.", "AI": {"tldr": "AI\u5206\u6790\u8c61\u7259\u4e0a\u7684\u624b\u5199\u6807\u8bb0\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u53d6\u8bc1\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8865\u5145\u73b0\u6709\u6280\u672f\u3002", "motivation": "\u8c61\u7259\u8d38\u6613\u5bfc\u81f4\u975e\u6d32\u8c61\u6570\u91cf\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u53d6\u8bc1\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u5982DNA\u5206\u6790\uff09\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u4e14\u6709\u65f6\u4e0d\u53ef\u884c\uff0c\u624b\u5199\u6807\u8bb0\u867d\u6613\u83b7\u53d6\u4f46\u672a\u88ab\u5145\u5206\u5229\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u6536\u96c66,085\u5f20\u8c61\u7259\u7167\u7247\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u53d617,000\u591a\u4e2a\u6807\u8bb0\uff0cAI\u5de5\u5177\u5206\u6790\u5e76\u8bc6\u522b184\u79cd\u91cd\u590d\u6807\u8bb0\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b020\u79cd\u6807\u8bb0\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u7f09\u83b7\u4e2d\u91cd\u590d\u51fa\u73b0\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u8d70\u79c1\u8005\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u8054\u7cfb\u3002", "conclusion": "AI\u624b\u5199\u5206\u6790\u4e3a\u91ce\u751f\u52a8\u7269\u53d6\u8bc1\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u53ef\u8865\u5145\u73b0\u6709\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u52a9\u529b\u6253\u51fb\u72af\u7f6a\u3002"}}

Many predictive tools lack accuracy, interpretability, and alignment\nwith intensive care unit (ICU) workflows. This study developed an interpretable\nmachine learning model for early AKI prediction in critically ill patients with\ncirrhosis.\n  Methods: We conducted a retrospective analysis of the MIMIC-IV v2.2 database,\nidentifying 1240 adult ICU patients with cirrhosis and excluding those with ICU\nstays under 48 hours or missing key data.

This visual-to-neural\nmapping is inherently a one-to-many relationship, as identical visual inputs\nreliably evoke variable hemodynamic responses across trials, contexts, and\nsubjects. However, existing deterministic methods struggle to simultaneously\nmodel this biological variability while capturing the underlying functional\nconsistency that encodes stimulus information. To address these limitations, we\npropose SynBrain, a generative framework that simulates the transformation from\nvisual semantics to neural responses in a probabilistic and biologically\ninterpretable manner. SynBrain introduces two key components: (i) BrainVAE\nmodels neural representations as continuous probability distributions via\nprobabilistic learning while maintaining functional consistency through visual\nsemantic constraints; (ii) A Semantic-to-Neural Mapper acts as a semantic\ntransmission pathway, projecting visual semantics into the neural response\nmanifold to facilitate high-fidelity fMRI synthesis. Experimental results\ndemonstrate that SynBrain surpasses state-of-the-art methods in\nsubject-specific visual-to-fMRI encoding performance.

Mamba, a recent\nsequence-to-sequence SSM, offers competitive accuracy with superior\ncomputational efficiency compared to state-of-the-art transformer models. While\nthis advantage makes Mamba particularly promising for resource-constrained edge\ndevices, no hardware acceleration frameworks are currently optimized for\ndeploying it in such environments. This paper presents eMamba, a comprehensive\nend-to-end hardware acceleration framework explicitly designed for deploying\nMamba models on edge platforms. eMamba maximizes computational efficiency by\nreplacing complex normalization layers with lightweight hardware-aware\nalternatives and approximating expensive operations, such as SiLU activation\nand exponentiation, considering the target applications. Then, it performs an\napproximation-aware neural architecture search (NAS) to tune the learnable\nparameters used during approximation. Evaluations with Fashion-MNIST, CIFAR-10,\nand MARS, an open-source human pose estimation dataset, show eMamba achieves\ncomparable accuracy to state-of-the-art techniques using 1.63-19.9$\\times$\nfewer parameters. In addition, it generalizes well to large-scale natural\nlanguage tasks, demonstrating stable perplexity across varying sequence lengths\non the WikiText2 dataset.

Inherited from generic federated learning, FGL is\ncritically challenged by statistical heterogeneity, where non-IID data\ndistributions across clients can severely impair model performance. A\nparticularly destructive form of this is class imbalance, which causes the\nglobal model to become biased towards majority classes and fail at identifying\nrare but critical events. This issue is exacerbated in FGL, as nodes from a\nminority class are often surrounded by biased neighborhood information,\nhindering the learning of expressive embeddings. To grapple with this\nchallenge, we propose GraphFedMIG, a novel FGL framework that reframes the\nproblem as a federated generative data augmentation task. GraphFedMIG employs a\nhierarchical generative adversarial network where each client trains a local\ngenerator to synthesize high-fidelity feature representations.

In practice, each hospital may need\nto train distinct models - differing in learning task, width, and depth - to\nmatch local data. For example, one hospital may use Euclidean architectures\nsuch as MLPs and CNNs for tabular or grid-like image data, while another may\nrequire non-Euclidean architectures such as graph neural networks (GNNs) for\nirregular data like brain connectomes. How to train such heterogeneous models\ncoherently across datasets, while enhancing each model's generalizability,\nremains an open problem.

Previous works have observed a high correlation between\n$\\Delta\\Delta G$ and entropy, using probabilities of biologically important\nobjects such as side chain angles and residue identities to estimate\n$\\Delta\\Delta G$. However, estimating the full conformational distribution of a\nprotein complex is generally considered intractable. In this work, we propose a\nnew approach to $\\Delta\\Delta G$ prediction that avoids this issue by instead\nleveraging energy-based models for estimating the probability of a complex's\nconformation.

Models using simulators explore broad design\nspaces but risk violating implicit constraints due to a lack of experimental\npriors. For example, in a new analysis we performed on a diverse set of models\non the GuacaMol benchmark using supervised classifiers, over 60\\% of molecules\nproposed had high probability of being mutagenic. In this work, we introduce\n\\ourdataset, a dataset of priors for design problems extracted from literature\ndescribing compounds used in lab settings. It is constructed with LLM pipelines\nfor discovering therapeutic entities in relevant paragraphs and summarizing\ninformation in concise fair-use facts. \\ourdataset~ consists of 32.3 million\npairs of natural language facts, and appropriate entity representations (i.e.\nSMILES or refseq IDs). To demonstrate the potential of the data, we train LLM,\nCLIP, and LLava architectures to reason jointly about text and design targets\nand evaluate on tasks from the Therapeutic Data Commons (TDC). \\ourdataset~is\nhighly effective for creating models with strong priors: in supervised\nprediction problems that use our data as pretraining, our best models with 15M\nlearnable parameters outperform larger 2B TxGemma on both regression and\nclassification TDC tasks, and perform comparably to 9B models on average.\nModels built with \\ourdataset~can be used as constraints while optimizing for\nnovel molecules in GuacaMol, resulting in proposals that are safer and nearly\nas effective.
