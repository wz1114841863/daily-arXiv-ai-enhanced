### [1] [Think as a Doctor: An Interpretable AI Approach for ICU Mortality Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11745)
*Qingwen Li,Xiaohang Zhao,Xiao Han,Hailiang Huang,Lanjuan Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ProtoDoctor是一个用于ICU死亡率预测的新型框架，通过原型学习实现内在可解释性，整合了临床病程识别、人口异质性和预后意识三个ICU决策实践的关键要素。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ICU死亡率预测不仅需要预测准确性，还需要可解释性来建立临床信任和满足监管标准。现有方法主要关注人口异质性，忽视了临床病程识别和预后意识，而原型学习方法虽然解决了临床病程识别，但未能整合其他要素。

Method: ProtoDoctor包含两个关键创新模块：预后临床病程识别模块（通过原型学习识别临床病程，并使用新型正则化机制实现预后意识）和人口异质性识别模块（通过队列特定原型和风险调整来建模人口异质性）。

Result: 广泛的实证评估表明，ProtoDoctor在预测准确性方面优于最先进的基线方法。人类评估进一步证实其解释在ICU实践中更具临床意义、可信度和适用性。

Conclusion: ProtoDoctor成功地将ICU决策实践的三个关键要素整合到其推理过程中，不仅提高了预测准确性，还提供了更具临床意义的解释，为ICU死亡率预测提供了一个理想的解决方案。

Abstract: Intensive Care Unit (ICU) mortality prediction, which estimates a patient's
mortality status at discharge using EHRs collected early in an ICU admission,
is vital in critical care. For this task, predictive accuracy alone is
insufficient; interpretability is equally essential for building clinical trust
and meeting regulatory standards, a topic that has attracted significant
attention in information system research. Accordingly, an ideal solution should
enable intrinsic interpretability and align its reasoning with three key
elements of the ICU decision-making practices: clinical course identification,
demographic heterogeneity, and prognostication awareness. However, conventional
approaches largely focus on demographic heterogeneity, overlooking clinical
course identification and prognostication awareness. Recent prototype learning
methods address clinical course identification, yet the integration of the
other elements into such frameworks remains underexplored. To address these
gaps, we propose ProtoDoctor, a novel ICU mortality prediction framework that
delivers intrinsic interpretability while integrating all three elements of the
ICU decision-making practices into its reasoning process. Methodologically,
ProtoDoctor features two key innovations: the Prognostic Clinical Course
Identification module and the Demographic Heterogeneity Recognition module. The
former enables the identification of clinical courses via prototype learning
and achieves prognostication awareness using a novel regularization mechanism.
The latter models demographic heterogeneity through cohort-specific prototypes
and risk adjustments. Extensive empirical evaluations demonstrate that
ProtoDoctor outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in predictive accuracy.
Human evaluations further confirm that its interpretations are more clinically
meaningful, trustworthy, and applicable in ICU practice.

### [2] [GAR: Generative Adversarial Reinforcement Learning for Formal Theorem Proving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11769)
*Ruida Wang,Jiarui Yao,Rui Pan,Shizhe Diao,Tong Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出GAR框架，通过对抗性训练联合优化问题生成器和求解器，实现隐式课程学习，提升数学定理证明的训练效率和性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖固定问题集，训练效率低且难以处理复杂问题，需要更高效的训练框架

Method: GAR框架：在可验证环境中联合训练问题生成器和求解器，通过对抗循环实现隐式课程学习，使问题难度与证明者能力对齐

Result: Goedel-Prover-V2-8B和DeepSeek-Prover-V2-7B在MiniF2F-Test上相对提升4.20%，DeepSeek-Prover-V2在ProofNet-Test上从22.58%提升至25.81%

Conclusion: GAR建立了可验证环境下问题生成与求解协同进化的一般强化学习范式，显著提升定理证明能力

Abstract: Solving math problems through verifiable languages such as Lean has
significantly impacted both the mathematics and computer science communities.
Current state-of-the-art models are often trained with expensive online
Reinforcement Learning (RL) or expert iteration. However, these approaches rely
on fixed problem sets, which causes inefficient training and limits the model
to tackle complex problems. To overcome these limitations, we propose GAR:
Generative Adversarial Reinforcement learning, a comprehensive RL training
framework that jointly trains the problem composer and solver in an adversarial
loop. GAR introduces an implicit curriculum learning mechanism, which aligns
task difficulty with the prover's evolving capability. It thereby improves the
training efficiency and enables stronger performance of proving advanced
theorems. Experiments show that with GAR training, Goedel-Prover-V2-8B and
DeepSeek-Prover-V2-7B achieve an average relative improvement in pass@32 of
4.20% on MiniF2F-Test benchmark, while DeepSeek-Prover-V2's pass@32 on
ProofNet-Test increases from 22.58% to 25.81%. Beyond formal proving, GAR
establishes a general RL paradigm for co-evolution of problem generation and
solving under verifiable environments.

### [3] [Combining Euclidean and Hyperbolic Representations for Node-level Anomaly Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11827)
*Simone Mungari,Ettore Ritacco,Pietro Sabatino*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Janus是一个节点级异常检测框架，联合使用欧几里得和双曲图神经网络来捕获节点表示的互补方面，通过对比学习目标对齐两种空间的嵌入，有效识别图中的复杂异常。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 节点级异常检测面临结构模式和特征分布多样化的挑战，在欺诈检测、网络安全和推荐系统等应用中至关重要。现有方法难以同时捕捉复杂结构中的细微异常。

Method: 每个节点由原始特征和结构特征（随机游走和度）组成两个视图，分别嵌入到欧几里得和双曲空间。使用多图自编码器框架，通过对比学习目标作为正则化项，对齐两种空间的嵌入。

Result: 在四个真实世界数据集上的实验表明，Janus始终优于浅层和深层基线方法，证明了结合多种几何表示能够提供稳健有效的异常检测方法。

Conclusion: 结合欧几里得和双曲空间的几何表示能够有效识别图中微妙而复杂的异常，为节点级异常检测提供了新的有效方法。

Abstract: Node-level anomaly detection (NAD) is challenging due to diverse structural
patterns and feature distributions. As such, NAD is a critical task with
several applications which range from fraud detection, cybersecurity, to
recommendation systems. We introduce Janus, a framework that jointly leverages
Euclidean and Hyperbolic Graph Neural Networks to capture complementary aspects
of node representations. Each node is described by two views, composed by the
original features and structural features derived from random walks and
degrees, then embedded into Euclidean and Hyperbolic spaces. A multi
Graph-Autoencoder framework, equipped with a contrastive learning objective as
regularization term, aligns the embeddings across the Euclidean and Hyperbolic
spaces, highlighting nodes whose views are difficult to reconcile and are thus
likely anomalous. Experiments on four real-world datasets show that Janus
consistently outperforms shallow and deep baselines, empirically demonstrating
that combining multiple geometric representations provides a robust and
effective approach for identifying subtle and complex anomalies in graphs.

### [4] [Schrödinger bridge for generative AI: Soft-constrained formulation and convergence analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11829)
*Jin Ma,Ying Tan,Renyuan Xu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出软约束薛定谔桥问题(SCSBP)，通过用惩罚函数替代硬终端约束来解决经典薛定谔桥问题在实际实现中的不稳定性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 经典薛定谔桥问题(SBP)强制执行硬终端约束，在高维或数据稀缺情况下往往导致实现不稳定。为解决这一问题，作者提出了软约束薛定谔桥问题。

Method: 使用软约束方法，将终端约束替换为一般惩罚函数，形成更灵活的McKean-Vlasov型随机控制公式。基于Doob的h变换表示、薛定谔势的稳定性结果、Gamma收敛和新的不动点论证进行分析。

Result: 建立了所有惩罚水平下最优解的存在性，证明当惩罚增加时，控制和价值函数以线性速率收敛到经典SBP。提供了软约束桥的第一个定量收敛保证。

Conclusion: 软约束薛定谔桥不仅解决了经典SBP的稳定性问题，还揭示了惩罚正则化如何实现鲁棒的生成建模、微调和迁移学习。

Abstract: Generative AI can be framed as the problem of learning a model that maps
simple reference measures into complex data distributions, and it has recently
found a strong connection to the classical theory of the Schr\"odinger bridge
problems (SBPs) due partly to their common nature of interpolating between
prescribed marginals via entropy-regularized stochastic dynamics. However, the
classical SBP enforces hard terminal constraints, which often leads to
instability in practical implementations, especially in high-dimensional or
data-scarce regimes. To address this challenge, we follow the idea of the
so-called soft-constrained Schr\"odinger bridge problem (SCSBP), in which the
terminal constraint is replaced by a general penalty function. This relaxation
leads to a more flexible stochastic control formulation of McKean-Vlasov type.
  We establish the existence of optimal solutions for all penalty levels and
prove that, as the penalty grows, both the controls and value functions
converge to those of the classical SBP at a linear rate. Our analysis builds on
Doob's h-transform representations, the stability results of Schr\"odinger
potentials, Gamma-convergence, and a novel fixed-point argument that couples an
optimization problem over the space of measures with an auxiliary entropic
optimal transport problem. These results not only provide the first
quantitative convergence guarantees for soft-constrained bridges but also shed
light on how penalty regularization enables robust generative modeling,
fine-tuning, and transfer learning.

### [5] [Z0-Inf: Zeroth Order Approximation for Data Influence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11832)
*Narine Kokhlikyan,Kamalika Chaudhuri,Saeed Mahloujifar*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种高效的零阶近似方法来估计训练数据的影响，仅需中间检查点的损失值和检查点本身，计算成本远低于现有方法，适用于大规模模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数据影响估计方法在大模型上存在精度低或计算成本高的问题，需要更高效准确的方法来分析训练数据如何影响模型预测行为。

Method: 使用零阶近似方法，仅依赖训练和测试数据在中间检查点上的损失值以及检查点本身，不需要梯度或逆Hessian计算。

Result: 在估计自影响方面达到更优精度，在训练-测试影响估计方面达到相当或改进的精度，计算时间和内存占用显著减少。

Conclusion: 该方法为大规模语言模型提供了可扩展且实用的训练数据分析工具，特别适用于损失函数不可微的情况。

Abstract: A critical aspect of analyzing and improving modern machine learning systems
lies in understanding how individual training examples influence a model's
predictive behavior. Estimating this influence enables critical applications,
including data selection and model debugging; in particular, self-influence,
which quantifies the influence of a training point on itself, has found many
uses in data quality assessment and outlier detection. Existing methods for
measuring data influence, however, are often impractical for large models due
to low accuracy or prohibitive computational costs: most approaches either
provide poor approximations or rely on gradients and inverse-Hessian
computations that remain challenging to scale. In this work, we introduce a
highly efficient zeroth-order approximation for estimating the influence of
training data that requires only a fraction of the time and memory footprint of
prior methods. Notably, our method relies solely on loss values of intermediate
checkpoints on the training and test data, along with the checkpoints
themselves, making it broadly applicable even when the loss function of
interest is non-differentiable. Beyond its computational efficiency, our
approach achieves superior accuracy in estimating self-influence and comparable
or improved accuracy in estimating train-test influence for fine-tuned large
language models, enabling scalable and practical analysis of how training data
shapes model behavior.

### [6] [Don't Walk the Line: Boundary Guidance for Filtered Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11834)
*Sarah Ball,Andreas Haupt*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出Boundary Guidance方法，通过强化学习微调生成模型，使其远离分类器的决策边界，从而提高安全性和实用性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法通过微调减少被过滤概率，但会导致模型生成靠近分类器决策边界的样本，增加误判风险。

Method: 使用强化学习微调生成模型，明确引导生成远离分类器的边界区域。

Result: 在越狱和模糊提示基准测试中，该方法提高了输出的安全性和实用性，LLM评估验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: Boundary Guidance方法在不同模型规模和奖励设计下都表现出稳健性，是提高生成模型安全性的有效方案。

Abstract: Generative models are increasingly paired with safety classifiers that filter
harmful or undesirable outputs. A common strategy is to fine-tune the generator
to reduce the probability of being filtered, but this can be suboptimal: it
often pushes the model toward producing samples near the classifier's decision
boundary, increasing both false positives and false negatives. We propose
Boundary Guidance, a reinforcement learning fine-tuning method that explicitly
steers generation away from the classifier's margin. On a benchmark of
jailbreak and ambiguous prompts, Boundary Guidance improves both the safety and
the utility of outputs, as judged by LLM-as-a-Judge evaluations. Comprehensive
ablations across model scales and reward designs demonstrate the robustness of
our approach.

### [7] [WaveletDiff: Multilevel Wavelet Diffusion For Time Series Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11839)
*Yu-Hsiang Wang,Olgica Milenkovic*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: WaveletDiff是一个基于小波系数的扩散模型框架，用于生成高质量的时间序列数据，通过跨尺度注意力机制和能量保持约束，在多个真实数据集上优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前时间序列生成模型局限于时域或频域，难以重现真实世界时间序列的多尺度结构，且大型高质量时间序列数据集稀缺。

Method: 在扩散模型中直接训练小波系数，结合各分解层的专用transformer和跨层注意力机制，通过自适应门控实现时频尺度间的选择性信息交换，并基于Parseval定理加入能量保持约束。

Result: 在能源、金融和神经科学等6个真实数据集上的测试表明，WaveletDiff在5个不同性能指标上始终优于最先进的时域和频域生成方法，判别分数和Context-FID分数平均比次优基线小3倍。

Conclusion: WaveletDiff通过利用时间序列固有的多分辨率结构，显著提升了合成时间序列的质量和多样性。

Abstract: Time series are ubiquitous in many applications that involve forecasting,
classification and causal inference tasks, such as healthcare, finance, audio
signal processing and climate sciences. Still, large, high-quality time series
datasets remain scarce. Synthetic generation can address this limitation;
however, current models confined either to the time or frequency domains
struggle to reproduce the inherently multi-scaled structure of real-world time
series. We introduce WaveletDiff, a novel framework that trains diffusion
models directly on wavelet coefficients to exploit the inherent
multi-resolution structure of time series data. The model combines dedicated
transformers for each decomposition level with cross-level attention mechanisms
that enable selective information exchange between temporal and frequency
scales through adaptive gating. It also incorporates energy preservation
constraints for individual levels based on Parseval's theorem to preserve
spectral fidelity throughout the diffusion process. Comprehensive tests across
six real-world datasets from energy, finance, and neuroscience domains
demonstrate that WaveletDiff consistently outperforms state-of-the-art
time-domain and frequency-domain generative methods on both short and long time
series across five diverse performance metrics. For example, WaveletDiff
achieves discriminative scores and Context-FID scores that are $3\times$
smaller on average than the second-best baseline across all datasets.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文研究了语言模型持续预训练中任务适应与知识保留的平衡问题，通过系统实验找到了在计算预算约束下优化回放比例配置的方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语言模型在适应新任务时需要平衡学习新能力和避免灾难性遗忘现有知识，而现有方法在计算约束下的最优回放比例配置尚不明确。

Method: 使用bAbI推理任务作为目标，应用合成数据生成技术，系统评估不同总标记预算和回放比例配置对任务掌握和知识保留的影响。

Result: 实验发现了一个能够平衡任务特定性能与通用知识保留的最优配置，显著降低了训练成本。

Conclusion: 基于研究结果提供了基于计算预算选择回放比例的实证指导，使实践者能够以显著降低的训练成本实现强大的任务适应。

Abstract: Adapting language models to new tasks through continued pretraining faces a
fundamental trade-off: models must learn new capabilities while avoiding
catastrophic forgetting of existing knowledge. While prior work has studied
synthetic data generation techniques, the optimal replay ratios for balancing
task performance and knowledge retention under computational constraints remain
poorly understood. We present a comprehensive empirical study investigating the
interplay between replay ratio configuration and computational budget when
adapting language models to new tasks. Using the bAbI reasoning tasks as our
target objective, we apply synthetic data generation and systematically
evaluate different total token budgets and replay ratio configurations. We
analyze their effects on both task mastery and general knowledge retention. Our
experiments reveal an optimal configuration that balances task-specific
performance with general knowledge retention. Based on our findings, we provide
empirically-grounded guidelines for selecting replay ratios based on
computational budget, enabling practitioners to achieve strong task adaptation
with significantly reduced training costs.

TL;DR: nuGPR是一个新的高斯过程回归框架，通过数值线性代数方法显著降低训练计算成本，包括使用预条件共轭梯度法、数据聚类识别协方差矩阵块对角结构、数值梯度优化超参数，并在GPU上并行化实现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决高斯过程回归训练计算成本高的问题，特别是在大规模数据集上的应用限制。

Method: 结合预条件共轭梯度法加速线性求解，利用数据聚类识别协方差矩阵块对角结构并构建低秩近似，使用数值梯度优化超参数避免反向传播，在GPU上并行化训练。

Result: 与现有最佳GPU GPR实现相比，训练时间减少最多2倍，峰值内存消耗减少最多12倍。

Conclusion: nuGPR框架通过数值线性代数技术有效解决了GPR的高计算成本问题，为大规模高斯过程回归应用提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) is an important type of supervised machine
learning model with inherent uncertainty measure in its predictions. We propose
a new framework, nuGPR, to address the well-known challenge of high computation
cost associated with GPR training. Our framework includes several ideas from
numerical linear algebra to reduce the amount of computation in key steps of
GPR, and we combine them to establish an end-to-end training algorithm.
Specifically, we leverage the preconditioned conjugate gradient method to
accelerate the convergence of the linear solves required in GPR. We exploit
clustering in the input data to identify block-diagonal structure of the
covariance matrix and subsequently construct low-rank approximations of the
off-diagonal blocks. These enhancements significantly reduce the time and space
complexity of our computations. In addition, unlike other frameworks that rely
on exact differentiation, we employ numerical gradients to optimize the
hyperparameters of our GPR model, further reducing the training cost by
eliminating the need for backpropagation. Lastly, we leverage the CUDA Toolkit
to efficiently parallelize the training procedure on NVIDIA GPUs. As a result,
nuGPR reduces total training time by up to 2x and peak memory consumption by up
to 12x on various synthetic and real-world datasets when compared to the best
existing GPU-based GPR implementation.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 评估7种先进视觉语言模型在多模态讽刺检测和解释生成上的表现，发现模型在二元讽刺检测上表现中等，但在生成高质量解释方面仍需任务特定微调。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开源视觉语言模型的发展为理解复杂多模态现象（如讽刺）提供了新机会，需要评估这些模型在检测和解释多模态讽刺方面的能力。

Method: 使用零样本、单样本和少样本提示策略，在三个基准讽刺数据集（Muse、MMSD2.0和SarcNet）上评估7种先进VLMs的讽刺检测和解释生成能力。

Result: 当前模型在二元讽刺检测方面取得中等成功，但在生成高质量解释方面表现不佳，需要任务特定微调才能提升解释质量。

Conclusion: 虽然视觉语言模型在多模态讽刺检测方面有一定能力，但在生成人类质量水平的解释方面仍有局限，需要进一步优化和任务特定训练。

Abstract: Recent advances in open-source vision-language models (VLMs) offer new
opportunities for understanding complex and subjective multimodal phenomena
such as sarcasm. In this work, we evaluate seven state-of-the-art VLMs - BLIP2,
InstructBLIP, OpenFlamingo, LLaVA, PaliGemma, Gemma3, and Qwen-VL - on their
ability to detect multimodal sarcasm using zero-, one-, and few-shot prompting.
Furthermore, we evaluate the models' capabilities in generating explanations to
sarcastic instances. We evaluate the capabilities of VLMs on three benchmark
sarcasm datasets (Muse, MMSD2.0, and SarcNet). Our primary objectives are
twofold: (1) to quantify each model's performance in detecting sarcastic
image-caption pairs, and (2) to assess their ability to generate human-quality
explanations that highlight the visual-textual incongruities driving sarcasm.
Our results indicate that, while current models achieve moderate success in
binary sarcasm detection, they are still not able to generate high-quality
explanations without task-specific finetuning.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了PubSub-VFL，一种基于发布/订阅架构的新型垂直联邦学习范式，通过分层异步机制解决传统VFL训练效率低和资源利用率不足的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着数字经济发展，组织间数据协作需求增长，但隐私担忧使直接数据共享不可行。现有垂直联邦学习架构存在计算资源利用率低、训练效率差的问题，特别是同步依赖设计增加训练延迟，参与方资源数据异质性进一步阻碍高效计算。

Method: 利用发布/订阅架构的解耦能力和参数服务器架构的数据并行性，设计分层异步机制；基于参与方系统配置文件制定优化问题，选择最优超参数同时保护隐私；理论分析证明稳定收敛性和与差分隐私等安全协议的兼容性。

Result: 在五个基准数据集上的案例研究表明，相比最先进基线方法，PubSub-VFL在不损失准确性的情况下加速训练2-7倍，计算资源利用率高达91.07%。

Conclusion: PubSub-VFL通过创新的发布/订阅架构有效解决了垂直联邦学习中的效率和资源利用问题，为安全高效的跨组织数据协作提供了可行方案。

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of the digital economy, data collaboration between
organizations has become a well-established business model, driving the growth
of various industries. However, privacy concerns make direct data sharing
impractical. To address this, Two-Party Split Learning (a.k.a. Vertical
Federated Learning (VFL)) has emerged as a promising solution for secure
collaborative learning. Despite its advantages, this architecture still suffers
from low computational resource utilization and training efficiency.
Specifically, its synchronous dependency design increases training latency,
while resource and data heterogeneity among participants further hinder
efficient computation. To overcome these challenges, we propose PubSub-VFL, a
novel VFL paradigm with a Publisher/Subscriber architecture optimized for
two-party collaborative learning with high computational efficiency. PubSub-VFL
leverages the decoupling capabilities of the Pub/Sub architecture and the data
parallelism of the parameter server architecture to design a hierarchical
asynchronous mechanism, reducing training latency and improving system
efficiency. Additionally, to mitigate the training imbalance caused by resource
and data heterogeneity, we formalize an optimization problem based on
participants' system profiles, enabling the selection of optimal
hyperparameters while preserving privacy. We conduct a theoretical analysis to
demonstrate that PubSub-VFL achieves stable convergence and is compatible with
security protocols such as differential privacy. Extensive case studies on five
benchmark datasets further validate its effectiveness, showing that, compared
to state-of-the-art baselines, PubSub-VFL not only accelerates training by $2
\sim 7\times$ without compromising accuracy, but also achieves a computational
resource utilization rate of up to 91.07%.

TL;DR: 该研究探讨了将参与者行为信息建模为时间序列是否能提高吞吐时间预测模型的性能。结果表明，包含参与者行为的模型在多个指标上均优于仅包含吞吐时间特征的基线模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 流程通常是资源驱动的，理解并纳入参与者行为对于预测至关重要。现有研究虽然纳入了参与者行为的某些方面，但将其作为时变信号在预测流程监控中的作用仍然有限。

Result: 参与者增强模型在RMSE、MAE和R2指标上持续优于仅包含吞吐时间特征的基线模型。

Conclusion: 将参与者行为建模为时间序列并纳入预测模型能够显著提高性能指标预测的准确性。

Abstract: Predictive Process Monitoring (PPM) is a key task in Process Mining that aims
to predict future behavior, outcomes, or performance indicators. Accurate
prediction of the latter is critical for proactive decision-making. Given that
processes are often resource-driven, understanding and incorporating actor
behavior in forecasting is crucial. Although existing research has incorporated
aspects of actor behavior, its role as a time-varying signal in PPM remains
limited. This study investigates whether incorporating actor behavior
information, modeled as time series, can improve the predictive performance of
throughput time (TT) forecasting models. Using real-life event logs, we
construct multivariate time series that include TT alongside actor-centric
features, i.e., actor involvement, the frequency of continuation, interruption,
and handover behaviors, and the duration of these behaviors. We train and
compare several models to study the benefits of adding actor behavior. The
results show that actor-enriched models consistently outperform baseline
models, which only include TT features, in terms of RMSE, MAE, and R2. These
findings demonstrate that modeling actor behavior over time and incorporating
this information into forecasting models enhances performance indicator
predictions.

*Guangming Sheng,Yuxuan Tong,Borui Wan,Wang Zhang,Chaobo Jia,Xibin Wu,Yuqi Wu,Xiang Li,Chi Zhang,Yanghua Peng,Haibin Lin,Xin Liu,Chuan Wu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Laminar是一个用于大语言模型强化学习后训练的可扩展系统，通过完全解耦架构解决了现有RL框架因轨迹生成延迟高度偏斜导致的GPU利用率低下的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有强化学习框架在大规模集群上训练时，由于RL轨迹生成的极端长尾偏斜性导致严重的GPU利用率不足，而现有的异步RL系统依赖全局权重同步，无法适应RL训练中高度偏斜且不断变化的轨迹生成延迟分布。

Method: 提出Laminar系统，采用完全解耦架构：1) 用中继工作者层替代全局更新，实现异步细粒度权重同步；2) 动态重新打包机制将长尾轨迹整合到专用rollout上；3) 完全解耦设计隔离故障，确保长时间运行的鲁棒性。

Result: 在1024-GPU集群上的评估显示，Laminar相比最先进系统实现了最高5.48倍的训练吞吐量加速，同时减少了模型收敛时间。

Conclusion: Laminar通过轨迹级异步和完全解耦架构，有效解决了大规模RL后训练中的可扩展性问题，显著提升了训练效率和系统鲁棒性。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) post-training for Large Language Models (LLMs) is
now scaling to large clusters and running for extended durations to enhance
model reasoning performance. However, the scalability of existing RL frameworks
is limited, as extreme long-tail skewness in RL trajectory generation causes
severe GPU underutilization. Current asynchronous RL systems attempt to
mitigate this, but they rely on global weight synchronization between the actor
and all rollouts, which creates a rigid model update schedule. This global
synchronization is ill-suited for the highly skewed and evolving distribution
of trajectory generation latency in RL training, crippling training efficiency.
Our key insight is that efficient scaling requires breaking this lockstep
through trajectory-level asynchrony, which generates and consumes each
trajectory independently. We propose Laminar, a scalable and robust RL
post-training system built on a fully decoupled architecture. First, we replace
global updates with a tier of relay workers acting as a distributed parameter
service. This enables asynchronous and fine-grained weight synchronization,
allowing rollouts to pull the latest weight anytime without stalling the
actor's training loop. Second, a dynamic repack mechanism consolidates
long-tail trajectories onto a few dedicated rollouts, maximizing generation
throughput. The fully decoupled design also isolates failures, ensuring
robustness for long-running jobs. Our evaluation on a 1024-GPU cluster shows
that Laminar achieves up to 5.48$\times$ training throughput speedup over
state-of-the-art systems, while reducing model convergence time.

Abstract: Knowledge graphs represent information as structured triples and serve as the
backbone for a wide range of applications, including question answering, link
prediction, and recommendation systems. A prominent line of research for
exploring knowledge graphs involves graph embedding methods, where entities and
relations are represented in low-dimensional vector spaces that capture
underlying semantics and structure. However, most existing methods rely on
assumptions such as the Closed World Assumption or Local Closed World
Assumption, treating missing triples as false. This contrasts with the Open
World Assumption underlying many real-world knowledge graphs. Furthermore,
while explicitly stated negative statements can help distinguish between false
and unknown triples, they are rarely included in knowledge graphs and are often
overlooked during embedding training.
  In this work, we introduce a novel approach that integrates explicitly
declared negative statements into the knowledge embedding learning process. Our
approach employs a dual-model architecture, where two embedding models are
trained in parallel, one on positive statements and the other on negative
statements. During training, each model generates negative samples by
corrupting positive samples and selecting the most likely candidates as scored
by the other model. The proposed approach is evaluated on both general-purpose
and domain-specific knowledge graphs, with a focus on link prediction and
triple classification tasks. The extensive experiments demonstrate that our
approach improves predictive performance over state-of-the-art embedding
models, demonstrating the value of integrating meaningful negative knowledge
into embedding learning.

Conclusion: 分层联邦学习在农业环境中具有显著优势，特别适用于异构农场环境和隐私敏感数据场景。

Abstract: In this paper, we presents a novel hierarchical federated learning
architecture specifically designed for smart agricultural production systems
and crop yield prediction. Our approach introduces a seasonal subscription
mechanism where farms join crop-specific clusters at the beginning of each
agricultural season. The proposed three-layer architecture consists of
individual smart farms at the client level, crop-specific aggregators at the
middle layer, and a global model aggregator at the top level. Within each crop
cluster, clients collaboratively train specialized models tailored to specific
crop types, which are then aggregated to produce a higher-level global model
that integrates knowledge across multiple crops. This hierarchical design
enables both local specialization for individual crop types and global
generalization across diverse agricultural contexts while preserving data
privacy and reducing communication overhead. Experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed system, showing that local and crop-layer models
closely follow actual yield patterns with consistent alignment, significantly
outperforming standard machine learning models. The results validate the
advantages of hierarchical federated learning in the agricultural context,
particularly for scenarios involving heterogeneous farming environments and
privacy-sensitive agricultural data.

TL;DR: 提出了CART框架，这是首个增强决策变换器在对抗性随机游戏中鲁棒性的方法，通过将每个阶段的交互建模为阶段博弈，并基于NashQ值来训练策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然Transformer架构已被用于序列决策，但其在对抗性环境中的鲁棒性尚未充分探索。本文旨在解决决策变换器在对抗性随机游戏中的脆弱性问题。

Method: 将每个阶段的交互建模为阶段博弈，定义期望最大价值作为收益，通过基于阶段博弈NashQ值来条件化Transformer策略，生成既抗对抗攻击又对状态转移不确定性的保守策略。

Result: CART在对抗性随机游戏中实现了更精确的极小极大值估计，并在各种对抗环境中始终获得更优的最坏情况回报。

Conclusion: CART框架成功提升了决策变换器在对抗性环境中的鲁棒性，为序列建模方法在对抗性强化学习中的应用提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: The Transformer, a highly expressive architecture for sequence modeling, has
recently been adapted to solve sequential decision-making, most notably through
the Decision Transformer (DT), which learns policies by conditioning on desired
returns. Yet, the adversarial robustness of reinforcement learning methods
based on sequence modeling remains largely unexplored. Here we introduce the
Conservative Adversarially Robust Decision Transformer (CART), to our knowledge
the first framework designed to enhance the robustness of DT in adversarial
stochastic games. We formulate the interaction between the protagonist and the
adversary at each stage as a stage game, where the payoff is defined as the
expected maximum value over subsequent states, thereby explicitly incorporating
stochastic state transitions. By conditioning Transformer policies on the NashQ
value derived from these stage games, CART generates policy that are
simultaneously less exploitable (adversarially robust) and conservative to
transition uncertainty. Empirically, CART achieves more accurate minimax value
estimation and consistently attains superior worst-case returns across a range
of adversarial stochastic games.

TL;DR: AdaRL是一个双层优化框架，通过自适应调整策略复杂度与任务内在维度对齐，在避免嵌套min-max优化的同时实现鲁棒强化学习。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有鲁棒强化学习方法依赖计算昂贵的嵌套min-max优化，导致策略过于保守。需要一种能平衡偏差-方差权衡且避免过度参数化的方法。

Method: 双层优化框架：下层在固定秩约束下优化策略，从Wasserstein球中采样动态模型；上层自适应调整秩以平衡偏差-方差权衡，将策略参数投影到低秩流形上。

Result: 在MuJoCo连续控制基准测试中，AdaRL不仅优于固定秩基线和最先进的鲁棒RL方法，还能收敛到任务的内在秩。

Conclusion: 自适应低秩策略表示为模型不确定性下的鲁棒RL提供了高效且原则性的替代方案。

Abstract: Robust reinforcement learning (Robust RL) seeks to handle epistemic
uncertainty in environment dynamics, but existing approaches often rely on
nested min--max optimization, which is computationally expensive and yields
overly conservative policies. We propose \textbf{Adaptive Rank Representation
(AdaRL)}, a bi-level optimization framework that improves robustness by
aligning policy complexity with the intrinsic dimension of the task. At the
lower level, AdaRL performs policy optimization under fixed-rank constraints
with dynamics sampled from a Wasserstein ball around a centroid model. At the
upper level, it adaptively adjusts the rank to balance the bias--variance
trade-off, projecting policy parameters onto a low-rank manifold. This design
avoids solving adversarial worst-case dynamics while ensuring robustness
without over-parameterization. Empirical results on MuJoCo continuous control
benchmarks demonstrate that AdaRL not only consistently outperforms fixed-rank
baselines (e.g., SAC) and state-of-the-art robust RL methods (e.g., RNAC,
Parseval), but also converges toward the intrinsic rank of the underlying
tasks. These results highlight that adaptive low-rank policy representations
provide an efficient and principled alternative for robust RL under model
uncertainty.

Motivation: 现实世界中用户行为既包含个人事件也包含关系事件，但现有方法通常将它们分开建模（序列方法处理个人事件，图方法处理关系事件），缺乏统一的处理框架。

Method: 作者引入了一组包含两种事件类型的数据集，提出了统一的数学形式化表示，并实证验证了同时考虑两种事件类型的模型效果。

Result: 实验结果表明，同时考虑个人事件和关系事件的模型性能更好，且当前方法仍有显著改进空间。

Conclusion: 该工作为统一用户事件建模提供了数据集和基准任务，鼓励该方向的研究进展。

Abstract: User event modeling plays a central role in many machine learning
applications, with use cases spanning e-commerce, social media, finance,
cybersecurity, and other domains. User events can be broadly categorized into
personal events, which involve individual actions, and relational events, which
involve interactions between two users. These two types of events are typically
modeled separately, using sequence-based methods for personal events and
graph-based methods for relational events. Despite the need to capture both
event types in real-world systems, prior work has rarely considered them
together. This is often due to the convenient simplification that user behavior
can be adequately represented by a single formalization, either as a sequence
or a graph. To address this gap, there is a need for public datasets and
prediction tasks that explicitly incorporate both personal and relational
events. In this work, we introduce a collection of such datasets, propose a
unified formalization, and empirically show that models benefit from
incorporating both event types. Our results also indicate that current methods
leave a notable room for improvements. We release these resources to support
further research in unified user event modeling and encourage progress in this
direction.

Abstract: Dementia disorders such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) and frontotemporal
dementia (FTD) exhibit overlapping electrophysiological signatures in EEG that
challenge accurate diagnosis. Existing EEG-based methods are limited by
full-band frequency analysis that hinders precise differentiation of dementia
subtypes and severity stages. We propose a variational mixture of graph neural
experts (VMoGE) that integrates frequency-specific biomarker identification
with structured variational inference for enhanced dementia diagnosis and
staging. VMoGE employs a multi-granularity transformer to extract multi-scale
temporal patterns across four frequency bands, followed by a variational graph
convolutional encoder using Gaussian Markov Random Field priors. Through
structured variational inference and adaptive gating, VMoGE links neural
specialization to physiologically meaningful EEG frequency bands. Evaluated on
two diverse datasets for both subtype classification and severity staging,
VMoGE achieves superior performance with AUC improvements of +4% to +10% over
state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, VMoGE provides interpretable insights
through expert weights that correlate with clinical indicators and spatial
patterns aligned with neuropathological signatures, facilitating EEG biomarker
discovery for comprehensive dementia diagnosis and monitoring.

TL;DR: Locaris是一个基于解码器大型语言模型的室内定位系统，将Wi-Fi接入点测量视为token，无需预处理即可处理原始Wi-Fi遥测数据，实现轻量级、可泛化的室内定位。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统室内Wi-Fi定位方法对环境变化、信道传播特性和硬件异构性高度敏感，需要大量人工校准且性能容易退化。

Method: 通过在不同Wi-Fi数据集上微调LLM，Locaris学习从原始信号直接映射到设备位置的轻量级可泛化模型，将每个AP测量视为token。

Result: 实验表明Locaris在各种遥测类型上匹配或超越现有技术，仅需少量校准点即可在新设备和部署场景中保持高精度，实现亚米级精度。

Conclusion: 紧凑型LLM可作为免校准回归模型用于室内定位，在异构Wi-Fi部署中提供可扩展且鲁棒的跨环境性能，特别适用于大规模部署场景。

Abstract: Indoor Wi-Fi positioning remains a challenging problem due to the high
sensitivity of radio signals to environmental dynamics, channel propagation
characteristics, and hardware heterogeneity. Conventional fingerprinting and
model-based approaches typically require labor-intensive calibration and suffer
rapid performance degradation when devices, channel or deployment conditions
change. In this paper, we introduce Locaris, a decoder-only large language
model (LLM) for indoor localization. Locaris treats each access point (AP)
measurement as a token, enabling the ingestion of raw Wi-Fi telemetry without
pre-processing. By fine-tuning its LLM on different Wi-Fi datasets, Locaris
learns a lightweight and generalizable mapping from raw signals directly to
device location. Our experimental study comparing Locaris with state-of-the-art
methods consistently shows that Locaris matches or surpasses existing
techniques for various types of telemetry. Our results demonstrate that compact
LLMs can serve as calibration-free regression models for indoor localization,
offering scalable and robust cross-environment performance in heterogeneous
Wi-Fi deployments. Few-shot adaptation experiments, using only a handful of
calibration points per device, further show that Locaris maintains high
accuracy when applied to previously unseen devices and deployment scenarios.
This yields sub-meter accuracy with just a few hundred samples, robust
performance under missing APs and supports any and all available telemetry. Our
findings highlight the practical viability of Locaris for indoor positioning in
the real-world scenarios, particularly in large-scale deployments where
extensive calibration is infeasible.

Method: 引入了三种重启方法：部分重启、自适应重启和选择性重启，用于改进RestartQ-UCB和RANDOMIZEDQ算法

Result: 在多种不同环境中实现了接近最优的实证性能，相比RestartQ-UCB将动态遗憾降低了高达91%

Conclusion: 提出的三种重启范式能有效解决非平稳强化学习中的重启设计问题，显著提升算法性能

Abstract: In this work, we propose three efficient restart paradigms for model-free
non-stationary reinforcement learning (RL). We identify two core issues with
the restart design of Mao et al. (2022)'s RestartQ-UCB algorithm: (1) complete
forgetting, where all the information learned about an environment is lost
after a restart, and (2) scheduled restarts, in which restarts occur only at
predefined timings, regardless of the incompatibility of the policy with the
current environment dynamics. We introduce three approaches, which we call
partial, adaptive, and selective restarts to modify the algorithms RestartQ-UCB
and RANDOMIZEDQ (Wang et al., 2025). We find near-optimal empirical performance
in multiple different environments, decreasing dynamic regret by up to $91$%
relative to RestartQ-UCB.

Conclusion: 高效可计算性与组合稀疏表示之间存在紧密联系，这为通过分层搜索稀疏结构进行优化提供了理论基础。

Abstract: We show that \emph{efficient Turing computability} at any fixed input/output
precision implies the existence of \emph{compositionally sparse}
(bounded-fan-in, polynomial-size) DAG representations and of corresponding
neural approximants achieving the target precision. Concretely: if
$f:[0,1]^d\to\R^m$ is computable in time polynomial in the bit-depths, then for
every pair of precisions $(n,m_{\mathrm{out}})$ there exists a bounded-fan-in
Boolean circuit of size and depth $\poly(n+m_{\mathrm{out}})$ computing the
discretized map; replacing each gate by a constant-size neural emulator yields
a deep network of size/depth $\poly(n+m_{\mathrm{out}})$ that achieves accuracy
$\varepsilon=2^{-m_{\mathrm{out}}}$. We also relate these constructions to
compositional approximation rates

Motivation: 当前基于KL散度的VAE方法在强制潜在空间匹配因子化高斯先验方面存在失败，无法可靠地实现解耦表示，需要更有效的机制来确保潜在变量的独立性。

Conclusion: 该工作为表示工程提供了基础工具，为模型可识别性和因果推理开辟了新途径，证明了MMD方法在解耦表示学习中的优越性。

Abstract: Learning disentangled representations, where distinct factors of variation
are captured by independent latent variables, is a central goal in machine
learning. The dominant approach has been the Variational Autoencoder (VAE)
framework, which uses a Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence penalty to encourage
the latent space to match a factorized Gaussian prior. In this work, however,
we provide direct evidence that this KL-based regularizer is an unreliable
mechanism, consistently failing to enforce the target distribution on the
aggregate posterior. We validate this and quantify the resulting entanglement
using our novel, unsupervised Latent Predictability Score (LPS). To address
this failure, we introduce the Programmable Prior Framework, a method built on
the Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD). Our framework allows practitioners to
explicitly sculpt the latent space, achieving state-of-the-art mutual
independence on complex datasets like CIFAR-10 and Tiny ImageNet without the
common reconstruction trade-off. Furthermore, we demonstrate how this
programmability can be used to engineer sophisticated priors that improve
alignment with semantically meaningful features. Ultimately, our work provides
a foundational tool for representation engineering, opening new avenues for
model identifiability and causal reasoning.

Conclusion: Y形生成流通过共享路径和分支结构，有效利用了数据中的层次结构，提高了生成效率和质量。

Abstract: Modern continuous-time generative models often induce V-shaped transport:
each sample travels independently along nearly straight trajectories from prior
to data, overlooking shared structure. We introduce Y-shaped generative flows,
which move probability mass together along shared pathways before branching to
target-specific endpoints. Our formulation is based on novel velocity-powered
transport cost with a sublinear exponent (between zero and one). this concave
dependence rewards joint and fast mass movement. Practically, we instantiate
the idea in a scalable neural ODE training objective. On synthetic, image, and
biology datasets, Y-flows recover hierarchy-aware structure, improve
distributional metrics over strong flow-based baselines, and reach targets with
fewer integration steps.

Conclusion: 该方法为更高效和鲁棒的无训练扩散加速提供了新视角，首次明确反映了扩散预训练固有的学习速度变化。

Abstract: Diffusion models are renowned for their generative capabilities, yet their
pretraining processes exhibit distinct phases of learning speed that have been
entirely overlooked in prior post-training acceleration efforts in the
community. In this study, we introduce a novel framework called MosaicDiff that
aligns diffusion pretraining dynamics with post-training sampling acceleration
via trajectory-aware structural pruning. Our approach leverages the observation
that the middle, fast-learning stage of diffusion pretraining requires more
conservative pruning to preserve critical model features, while the early and
later, slow-learning stages benefit from a more aggressive pruning strategy.
This adaptive pruning mechanism is the first to explicitly mirror the inherent
learning speed variations of diffusion pretraining, thereby harmonizing the
model's inner training dynamics with its accelerated sampling process.
Extensive experiments on DiT and SDXL demonstrate that our method achieves
significant speed-ups in sampling without compromising output quality,
outperforming previous state-of-the-art methods by large margins, also
providing a new viewpoint for more efficient and robust training-free diffusion
acceleration.

Result: 通过玩具Transformer的概念验证，展示了QLENS在探究模型预测轨迹中各层影响方面的潜力。

Conclusion: QLENS为跨领域洞察提供了基础框架，有助于更广泛地理解Transformer的工作机制。

Abstract: In natural language processing, current methods for understanding
Transformers are successful at identifying intermediate predictions during a
model's inference. However, these approaches function as limited diagnostic
checkpoints, lacking a mathematical framework for mechanistically modeling how
each layer facilitates transitions between these evolving states. This
interpretability gap and past successes of interdisciplinary outlooks inspire
us to turn to physics in search of a descriptive mathematical framework for
Transformers. We observe that language models are intrinsically probabilistic,
an attribute that is echoed in the core postulates of quantum mechanics. This
parallel inspires us to translate insights from this discipline to that of
natural language processing. Towards this objective, we propose QLENS a novel
attempt to develop a physics-based perspective on the Transformer generation
process. Under QLENS, a Transformer is studied by converting its latent
activations into a state vector in a Hilbert space derived from the model's
output units. This state subsequently evolves through hidden layers -
reformulated as unitary operators and analogously defined Hamiltonians - during
inference. The model's final probability distribution is obtained by applying
the Born rule to the end state using a specific measurement operator. To
demonstrate QLENS's potential, we conduct a proof-of-concept by probing a toy
Transformer to investigate the influence of individual layers in a model's
prediction trajectory. We present our work as a foundation for cross-domain
insights to be leveraged towards a broader understanding of Transformers.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的基于偏好的视觉语言模型微调方法存在脆弱性问题，错误的负样本会产生无信息梯度，导致训练不稳定。

Method: 采用两阶段方法：第一阶段使用温和负样本进行监督微调，第二阶段应用冷却加权的DPO目标，通过负样本的平均token对数概率来缩放负项权重。

Result: 在多种VLM任务中，CW-DPO相比SFT-only和原始DPO实现了更稳定的优化、更好的校准、更高的配对胜率，且收敛步数更少。

Conclusion: 在冷却偏好之前平滑学习动态是进行稳健VLM对齐的简单通用原则。

Abstract: Preference-based finetuning of vision--language models (VLMs) is brittle:
trivially wrong negatives inject uninformative gradients that destabilize
training. We recast alignment as \textbf{learning-dynamics--aware optimization}
and introduce \textbf{Cooling-Weighted DPO (CW-DPO)}, a two-stage recipe that
explicitly models and exploits the training trajectory. \textbf{Stage 1}
performs supervised finetuning with \textbf{gentle negatives}:
\textbf{low-weight smoothed supervision} that regularizes the base policy and
curbs overconfidence without explicit penalties. \textbf{Stage 2} applies a DPO
objective in which the \textbf{negative term is scaled by a cooling weight}
computed from the model's \textbf{average token log-probability} on each
negative, suppressing uninformative gradients from easy or off-distribution
samples while preserving signal from hard negatives. In practice, we emphasize
\textbf{on-policy negatives} and allow \textbf{mixed negatives} by blending a
controllable fraction of dataset negatives to maintain contrast freshness.
Throughout, we instrument training with $\Delta\!\log p$ probes on positives
and negatives as first-class signals for early stopping, curriculum design, and
failure diagnosis. Across diverse VLM tasks, CW-DPO yields \textbf{more stable
optimization}, \textbf{better calibration}, and \textbf{higher pairwise
win-rates} than SFT-only and vanilla DPO, while \textbf{converging in fewer
steps}. Ablations isolate the \textbf{cooling-weight mechanism} as the primary
driver of these gains and show complementary benefits from mixing on-policy and
dataset negatives. Taken together, our results show that \textbf{smoothing
learning dynamics before cooling preferences} is a simple, general principle
for robust VLM alignment.

Method: 使用统计力学工具分析随机不对称循环网络中动态吸引子的出现条件，推导固定点数量与自耦合强度的闭式表达式。提出基于固定点的生物合理监督学习算法，通过瞬态外部刺激将输入映射到动态固定点，并通过局部可塑性稳定配置。

Conclusion: 算法性能与揭示的相变密切相关，并提出了皮层启发的自耦合替代方案。这项工作为弥合AI与神经科学提供了重要一步，展示了神经动力学如何支持可扩展的局部分布式学习。

Abstract: Despite the striking successes of deep neural networks trained with
gradient-based optimization, these methods differ fundamentally from their
biological counterparts. This gap raises key questions about how nature
achieves robust, sample-efficient learning at minimal energy costs and solves
the credit-assignment problem without backpropagation. We take a step toward
bridging contemporary AI and computational neuroscience by studying how neural
dynamics can support fully local, distributed learning that scales to simple
machine-learning benchmarks. Using tools from statistical mechanics, we
identify conditions for the emergence of robust dynamical attractors in random
asymmetric recurrent networks. We derive a closed-form expression for the
number of fixed points as a function of self-coupling strength, and we reveal a
phase transition in their structure: below a critical self-coupling, isolated
fixed points coexist with exponentially many narrow clusters showing the
overlap-gap property; above it, subdominant yet dense and extensive clusters
appear. These fixed points become accessible, including to a simple
asynchronous dynamical rule, after an algorithm-dependent self-coupling
threshold. Building on this analysis, we propose a biologically plausible
algorithm for supervised learning with any binary recurrent network. Inputs are
mapped to fixed points of the dynamics, by relaxing under transient external
stimuli and stabilizing the resulting configurations via local plasticity. We
show that our algorithm can learn an entangled version of MNIST, leverages
depth to develop hierarchical representations and increase hetero-association
capacity, and is applicable to several architectures. Finally, we highlight the
strong connection between algorithm performance and the unveiled phase
transition, and we suggest a cortex-inspired alternative to self-couplings for
its emergence.

*Conor Rowan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文发现使用精确Hessian矩阵的二阶优化方法在神经网络训练中会可靠地失败，这与使用近似Hessian的准牛顿方法形成对比，这为非线性离散化的几何性质和损失景观中驻点的分布提供了新见解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究二阶优化方法作为标准一阶优化器（如梯度下降和ADAM）的替代方案在神经网络训练中的表现，特别关注使用精确曲率信息与近似曲率信息的差异。

Method: 比较使用精确Hessian矩阵和准牛顿方法（近似Hessian）在神经网络训练中的表现，分析失败模式。

Result: 使用精确Hessian矩阵的二阶优化方法在神经网络训练中可靠地失败，而准牛顿方法表现更好。这一发现挑战了关于损失景观充满局部最小值的传统观点。

Conclusion: 精确曲率信息在神经网络训练中的失败揭示了非线性离散化的几何特性和损失景观中驻点分布的新特征，表明损失景观可能不像传统认为的那样充满局部最小值。

Abstract: Second-order methods are emerging as promising alternatives to standard
first-order optimizers such as gradient descent and ADAM for training neural
networks. Though the advantages of including curvature information in computing
optimization steps have been celebrated in the scientific machine learning
literature, the only second-order methods that have been studied are
quasi-Newton, meaning that the Hessian matrix of the objective function is
approximated. Though one would expect only to gain from using the true Hessian
in place of its approximation, we show that neural network training reliably
fails when relying on exact curvature information. The failure modes provide
insight both into the geometry of nonlinear discretizations as well as the
distribution of stationary points in the loss landscape, leading us to question
the conventional wisdom that the loss landscape is replete with local minima.

TL;DR: 该论文从理论上分析了Mamba模型的上下文学习能力，证明其能够通过测试时特征学习有效提取单索引模型中的相关方向，在样本复杂度上优于线性Transformer，与非线性Transformer相当。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mamba作为新提出的线性时间序列模型，虽然计算效率高且实证表现优异，但其底层机制的理论理解仍然有限，需要对其上下文学习能力进行严格的理论分析。

Method: 研究Mamba在低维非线性目标函数任务中的上下文学习能力，特别关注单索引模型y≈g*(⟨β,x⟩)，分析Mamba通过梯度预训练后如何通过测试时特征学习提取相关方向β。

Result: 证明Mamba能够实现高效的上下文学习，其测试时样本复杂度优于线性Transformer（表现为核方法），与非线性Transformer相当，能够超越相关统计查询下界并接近信息理论最优速率。

Conclusion: Mamba的非线性门控机制在特征提取中起关键作用，这是Mamba能够同时实现计算效率和高性能的根本驱动力。

Abstract: Mamba, a recently proposed linear-time sequence model, has attracted
significant attention for its computational efficiency and strong empirical
performance. However, a rigorous theoretical understanding of its underlying
mechanisms remains limited. In this work, we provide a theoretical analysis of
Mamba's in-context learning (ICL) capability by focusing on tasks defined by
low-dimensional nonlinear target functions. Specifically, we study in-context
learning of a single-index model $y \approx g_*(\langle \boldsymbol{\beta},
\boldsymbol{x} \rangle)$, which depends on only a single relevant direction
$\boldsymbol{\beta}$, referred to as feature. We prove that Mamba, pretrained
by gradient-based methods, can achieve efficient ICL via test-time feature
learning, extracting the relevant direction directly from context examples.
Consequently, we establish a test-time sample complexity that improves upon
linear Transformers -- analyzed to behave like kernel methods -- and is
comparable to nonlinear Transformers, which have been shown to surpass the
Correlational Statistical Query (CSQ) lower bound and achieve near
information-theoretically optimal rate in previous works. Our analysis reveals
the crucial role of the nonlinear gating mechanism in Mamba for feature
extraction, highlighting it as the fundamental driver behind Mamba's ability to
achieve both computational efficiency and high performance.

Conclusion: VAR基生成分类器为研究生成分类器提供了新视角，具有实际应用价值，并展现出与扩散方法不同的特性。

Abstract: Generative classifiers, which leverage conditional generative models for
classification, have recently demonstrated desirable properties such as
robustness to distribution shifts. However, recent progress in this area has
been largely driven by diffusion-based models, whose substantial computational
cost severely limits scalability. This exclusive focus on diffusion-based
methods has also constrained our understanding of generative classifiers. In
this work, we propose a novel generative classifier built on recent advances in
visual autoregressive (VAR) modeling, which offers a new perspective for
studying generative classifiers. To further enhance its performance, we
introduce the Adaptive VAR Classifier$^+$ (A-VARC$^+$), which achieves a
superior trade-off between accuracy and inference speed, thereby significantly
improving practical applicability. Moreover, we show that the VAR-based method
exhibits fundamentally different properties from diffusion-based methods. In
particular, due to its tractable likelihood, the VAR-based classifier enables
visual explainability via token-wise mutual information and demonstrates
inherent resistance to catastrophic forgetting in class-incremental learning
tasks.

Motivation: 深度学习睡眠分期模型在未见受试者上泛化能力差，现有对比学习方法未能充分提取领域不变特征，需要解决嵌入在样本间未共享信息中的领域特征问题。

Result: 在SleepEDF-20和MASS公开睡眠分期基准数据集上的实验表明，该方法持续优于最先进的方法。

Conclusion: 提出的MEASURE框架能有效减少领域相关信息，同时保留睡眠分期所需的关键特征，在领域泛化方面表现出色。

Abstract: Deep learning-based automatic sleep staging has significantly advanced in
performance and plays a crucial role in the diagnosis of sleep disorders.
However, those models often struggle to generalize on unseen subjects due to
variability in physiological signals, resulting in degraded performance in
out-of-distribution scenarios. To address this issue, domain generalization
approaches have recently been studied to ensure generalized performance on
unseen domains during training. Among those techniques, contrastive learning
has proven its validity in learning domain-invariant features by aligning
samples of the same class across different domains. Despite its potential, many
existing methods are insufficient to extract adequately domain-invariant
representations, as they do not explicitly address domain characteristics
embedded within the unshared information across samples. In this paper, we
posit that mitigating such domain-relevant attributes-referred to as excess
domain-relevant information-is key to bridging the domain gap. However, the
direct strategy to mitigate the domain-relevant attributes often overfits
features at the high-level information, limiting their ability to leverage the
diverse temporal and spectral information encoded in the multiple feature
levels. To address these limitations, we propose a novel MEASURE (Multi-scalE
minimAl SUfficient Representation lEarning) framework, which effectively
reduces domain-relevant information while preserving essential temporal and
spectral features for sleep stage classification. In our exhaustive experiments
on publicly available sleep staging benchmark datasets, SleepEDF-20 and MASS,
our proposed method consistently outperformed state-of-the-art methods. Our
code is available at : https://github.com/ku-milab/Measure

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的数据归因方法将样本间影响视为静态，但神经网络在不同学习阶段表现出不同的影响模式，需要研究这种动态变化。

Method: 基于奇异学习理论构建分阶段数据归因框架，通过玩具模型进行理论和实证验证，并在语言模型中大规模演示。

Result: 验证了影响会非单调变化，包括符号翻转和过渡期峰值，这些动态变化与模型学习语义层次的过程直接对应。

Conclusion: 神经网络训练过程中样本间的影响是动态变化的，这种变化与模型的发展阶段和学习层次结构密切相关。

Abstract: Current training data attribution (TDA) methods treat the influence one
sample has on another as static, but neural networks learn in distinct stages
that exhibit changing patterns of influence. In this work, we introduce a
framework for stagewise data attribution grounded in singular learning theory.
We predict that influence can change non-monotonically, including sign flips
and sharp peaks at developmental transitions. We first validate these
predictions analytically and empirically in a toy model, showing that dynamic
shifts in influence directly map to the model's progressive learning of a
semantic hierarchy. Finally, we demonstrate these phenomena at scale in
language models, where token-level influence changes align with known
developmental stages.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GraphShaper是一个几何感知的图基础模型框架，通过多几何专业化增强图编码，解决了当前方法在结构边界处性能显著下降的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法假设所有图结构都可以在单一欧几里得空间中编码，但实际上树结构需要双曲几何来保持层次分支，而循环模式依赖球面几何的闭包特性。在结构边界处，节点面临冲突的几何约束，导致性能下降超过20个百分点。

Method: GraphShaper采用针对不同几何空间的专家网络，动态计算融合权重，基于局部结构特征自适应地整合几何特性，在文本嵌入对齐前保持结构完整性。

Result: 在零样本设置下，GraphShaper在引文网络上实现了9.47%的准确率提升，在社交网络上实现了7.63%的准确率提升。

Conclusion: GraphShaper框架通过尊重图结构的内在几何多样性，显著提升了图基础模型的性能，特别是在结构边界处。

Abstract: Graph foundation models represent a transformative paradigm for learning
transferable representations across diverse graph domains. Recent methods
leverage large language models to unify graph and text modalities into a shared
representation space using contrastive learning. However, systematic
evaluations reveal significant performance degradation at structural boundaries
where distinct topological patterns converge, with accuracy losses exceeding 20
percentage points. This issue arises from a key limitation: current methods
assume all graph structures can be encoded within a single Euclidean space. In
reality, tree structures require hyperbolic geometry to preserve hierarchical
branching, while cyclic patterns depend on spherical geometry for closure
properties. At structural boundaries, nodes experience conflicting geometric
constraints that uniform encoding spaces cannot resolve. This raises a crucial
challenge: \textbf{Can alignment frameworks be designed to respect the
intrinsic geometric diversity of graph structures?} We introduce
\textbf{GraphShaper}, a geometry-aware framework that enhances graph encoding
through multi-geometric specialization. Our approach employs expert networks
tailored to different geometric spaces, dynamically computing fusion weights to
adaptively integrate geometric properties based on local structural
characteristics. This adaptive fusion preserves structural integrity before
alignment with text embeddings. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
GraphShaper achieves 9.47\% accuracy improvements on citation networks and
7.63\% on social networks in zero-shot settings.

TL;DR: 提出H4G框架解决文本属性图中的过抽象问题，通过降低双曲空间嵌入半径来保留细粒度结构信息，在异配性和同配性图上分别实现12.8%和8.4%的零样本性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在异配性图上进行细粒度模式识别时存在困难，存在过抽象问题：在过大的双曲半径下操作，将多尺度结构信息压缩为统一的高层抽象，导致关键局部模式的信息丢失。

Method: 提出H4G框架，使用可学习的块对角缩放矩阵和Möbius矩阵乘法系统性地降低嵌入半径，在保持全局感知能力的同时恢复对细粒度模式的访问。

Result: H4G在异配性图上实现12.8%的零样本性能提升，在同配性图上实现8.4%的提升，达到最先进的零样本性能。

Conclusion: 半径减小能够实现忠实多尺度表示，推动零样本图学习的进步，证实了在双曲空间中保留细粒度结构细节对图学习的重要性。

Abstract: Text-attributed graphs are widely used across domains, offering rich
opportunities for zero-shot learning via graph-text alignment. However,
existing methods struggle with tasks requiring fine-grained pattern
recognition, particularly on heterophilic graphs. Through empirical and
theoretical analysis, we identify an \textbf{over-abstraction problem}: current
approaches operate at excessively large hyperbolic radii, compressing
multi-scale structural information into uniform high-level abstractions. This
abstraction-induced information loss obscures critical local patterns essential
for accurate predictions. By analyzing embeddings in hyperbolic space, we
demonstrate that optimal graph learning requires \textbf{faithful preservation}
of fine-grained structural details, better retained by representations
positioned closer to the origin. To address this, we propose \textbf{H4G}, a
framework that systematically reduces embedding radii using learnable
block-diagonal scaling matrices and M\"obius matrix multiplication. This
approach restores access to fine-grained patterns while maintaining global
receptive ability with minimal computational overhead. Experiments show H4G
achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot performance with \textbf{12.8\%}
improvement on heterophilic graphs and \textbf{8.4\%} on homophilic graphs,
confirming that radius reduction enables faithful multi-scale representation
for advancing zero-shot graph learning.

TL;DR: 该论文提出模块特定训练(MST)框架，通过动态稀疏训练策略解决深度强化学习中模型规模扩大导致的性能下降问题，在不同模块采用定制化训练方法，显著提升可扩展性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度强化学习中，模型规模扩大往往导致性能下降，主要由于优化病理如可塑性丧失等问题。现有动态训练方法存在三个关键局限：对所有模块采用统一策略、评估基础架构不足、缺乏不同动态方法的系统比较。

Method: 通过跨模块和架构的全面调查，开发模块特定训练(MST)框架，结合动态稀疏训练策略，包括稀疏到稀疏、稠密到稀疏、稀疏到稠密等方法，针对编码器、评论家和行动者等不同模块采用定制化训练。

Result: 研究表明动态稀疏训练策略提供模块特定的优势，与架构改进形成互补。MST框架在不修改算法的情况下，显著提升了多种RL算法的可扩展性表现。

Conclusion: 模块特定训练框架有效利用架构改进的优势，通过动态稀疏训练策略解决了深度强化学习的可扩展性问题，为大规模RL模型训练提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Scaling neural networks has driven breakthrough advances in machine learning,
yet this paradigm fails in deep reinforcement learning (DRL), where larger
models often degrade performance due to unique optimization pathologies such as
plasticity loss. While recent works show that dynamically adapting network
topology during training can mitigate these issues, existing studies have three
critical limitations: (1) applying uniform dynamic training strategies across
all modules despite encoder, critic, and actor following distinct learning
paradigms, (2) focusing evaluation on basic architectures without clarifying
the relative importance and interaction between dynamic training and
architectural improvements, and (3) lacking systematic comparison between
different dynamic approaches including sparse-to-sparse, dense-to-sparse, and
sparse-to-dense. Through comprehensive investigation across modules and
architectures, we reveal that dynamic sparse training strategies provide
module-specific benefits that complement the primary scalability foundation
established by architectural improvements. We finally distill these insights
into Module-Specific Training (MST), a practical framework that further
exploits the benefits of architectural improvements and demonstrates
substantial scalability gains across diverse RL algorithms without algorithmic
modifications.

TL;DR: Chimera是一个统一模型，通过状态空间模型直接整合数据拓扑结构，无需领域特定的偏置，在语言、视觉和图数据领域都表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer模型依赖自注意力机制，将数据视为无序元素集合，忽略了数据的邻域结构或图拓扑，需要设计任务特定的偏置（如位置嵌入、随机游走）来整合拓扑结构，但这需要大量工作且可能引入副作用。

Method: 将状态空间模型（自然不需要位置嵌入）推广到捕获任意图拓扑，并提出算法优化：对于有向无环图可实现线性时间递归，对于一般图通过数学松弛达到Transformer的二次复杂度。

Result: Chimera在GLUE上比BERT高0.7分，在ImageNet-1k上比ViT高2.6%，在Long Range Graph Benchmark上优于所有基线方法。

Conclusion: 数据拓扑是跨模态的强大归纳偏置，Chimera的核心贡献得到验证。

Abstract: Transformer-based deep learning methods have become the standard approach for
modeling diverse data such as sequences, images, and graphs. These methods rely
on self-attention, which treats data as an unordered set of elements. This
ignores the neighborhood structure or graph topology of the data and requires
inductive biases--such as position embeddings in sequences and images, or
random walks in graphs--to incorporate topology. However, designing such
task-specific biases requires significant effort and can introduce side effects
that hinder generalization. We introduce Chimera, a unified model that directly
incorporates data topology in a principled way, removing the need for
domain-specific biases. The key idea is that state space models--which
naturally do not require position embeddings--can be generalized to capture any
graph topology. Our experiments show that Chimera achieves strong performance
across language, vision, and graph domains, outperforming BERT on GLUE by 0.7
points, ViT on ImageNet-1k by 2.6%, and all baselines on the Long Range Graph
Benchmark. We further propose algorithmic optimizations to improve Chimera's
efficiency: (1) for Directed Acyclic Graphs, Chimera can be implemented as a
linear-time recurrence; (2) for general graphs, a simple mathematical
relaxation achieves Transformer's quadratic complexity without domain-specific
heuristics. These results validate Chimera's core contribution and support the
idea that data topology is a powerful inductive bias across modalities.

Motivation: 现有图小样本学习方法存在两个主要局限：1）使用预定义的统一图滤波器，无法适应真实图中局部拓扑结构的异质性；2）假设支持集和查询集来自相同分布，但在小样本条件下有限的支持集数据可能无法充分捕捉查询集的复杂分布。

Method: GRACE框架整合了自适应频谱专家和跨集分布校准技术，通过自适应频谱专家处理局部结构变化，通过跨集分布校准解决分布不匹配问题。

Result: 理论分析表明该方法通过适应局部结构变化和跨集分布校准增强了模型泛化能力。实证结果显示GRACE在各种实验设置下始终优于现有最先进基线方法。

Conclusion: GRACE框架有效解决了图小样本学习中的局部结构适应和分布校准问题，显著提升了模型性能。

Abstract: Graph few-shot learning has attracted increasing attention due to its ability
to rapidly adapt models to new tasks with only limited labeled nodes. Despite
the remarkable progress made by existing graph few-shot learning methods,
several key limitations remain. First, most current approaches rely on
predefined and unified graph filters (e.g., low-pass or high-pass filters) to
globally enhance or suppress node frequency signals. Such fixed spectral
operations fail to account for the heterogeneity of local topological
structures inherent in real-world graphs. Moreover, these methods often assume
that the support and query sets are drawn from the same distribution. However,
under few-shot conditions, the limited labeled data in the support set may not
sufficiently capture the complex distribution of the query set, leading to
suboptimal generalization. To address these challenges, we propose GRACE, a
novel Graph few-shot leaRning framework that integrates Adaptive spectrum
experts with Cross-sEt distribution calibration techniques. Theoretically, the
proposed approach enhances model generalization by adapting to both local
structural variations and cross-set distribution calibration. Empirically,
GRACE consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across a wide range
of experimental settings. Our code can be found here.

<details>

Motivation: 联邦学习虽然保护隐私，但参与者对训练数据的独立性使其容易受到投毒攻击，且协作会传播偏见，即使是无意的。

Method: 通过解决公平性指标（如人口统计均等和均等化几率）的优化问题来计算公平性损失，恶意客户端在训练时故意增加公平性损失。

Result: 攻击效果显著，在仅有一个恶意客户端的情况下，能将偏见增加高达90%，且对抗先进的拜占庭鲁棒和公平感知聚合方案。

Conclusion: 这种攻击隐蔽且难以检测，突显了联邦学习系统在公平性方面的脆弱性，需要更强的防御机制。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) is a privacy-preserving machine learning technique
that facilitates collaboration among participants across demographics. FL
enables model sharing, while restricting the movement of data. Since FL
provides participants with independence over their training data, it becomes
susceptible to poisoning attacks. Such collaboration also propagates bias among
the participants, even unintentionally, due to different data distribution or
historical bias present in the data. This paper proposes an intentional
fairness attack, where a client maliciously sends a biased model, by increasing
the fairness loss while training, even considering homogeneous data
distribution. The fairness loss is calculated by solving an optimization
problem for fairness metrics such as demographic parity and equalized odds. The
attack is insidious and hard to detect, as it maintains global accuracy even
after increasing the bias. We evaluate our attack against the state-of-the-art
Byzantine-robust and fairness-aware aggregation schemes over different
datasets, in various settings. The empirical results demonstrate the attack
efficacy by increasing the bias up to 90\%, even in the presence of a single
malicious client in the FL system.

Motivation: 标准监督学习需要完整标记的数据集，但在生存数据中存在大量右删失实例（只知道时间下限）。现实世界中，对删失患者进行随访不一定能完全解删失，且信息获取量受预算限制。

Method: 提出预算学习算法，允许学习器使用预算付费获取删失实例的部分标签信息（如从"3年，删失"变为"7.2年，未删失"或其他变体），将最先进的预算学习算法应用于生存数据。

Result: 理论分析和实验结果表明，该方法在多个生存任务基准测试中优于其他潜在方法，其边界和时间复杂度与标准主动学习方法BatchBALD渐近等价。

Conclusion: 该研究为生存数据中的预算学习提供了有效的解决方案，能够处理现实世界中数据收集的预算限制和删失特性，在理论和实验层面均表现出良好性能。

Abstract: Standard supervised learners attempt to learn a model from a labeled dataset.
Given a small set of labeled instances, and a pool of unlabeled instances, a
budgeted learner can use its given budget to pay to acquire the labels of some
unlabeled instances, which it can then use to produce a model. Here, we explore
budgeted learning in the context of survival datasets, which include (right)
censored instances, where we know only a lower bound on an instance's
time-to-event. Here, that learner can pay to (partially) label a censored
instance -- e.g., to acquire the actual time for an instance [perhaps go from
(3 yr, censored) to (7.2 yr, uncensored)], or other variants [e.g., learn about
one more year, so go from (3 yr, censored) to either (4 yr, censored) or
perhaps (3.2 yr, uncensored)]. This serves as a model of real world data
collection, where follow-up with censored patients does not always lead to
uncensoring, and how much information is given to the learner model during data
collection is a function of the budget and the nature of the data itself. We
provide both experimental and theoretical results for how to apply
state-of-the-art budgeted learning algorithms to survival data and the
respective limitations that exist in doing so. Our approach provides bounds and
time complexity asymptotically equivalent to the standard active learning
method BatchBALD. Moreover, empirical analysis on several survival tasks show
that our model performs better than other potential approaches on several
benchmarks.

Abstract: Advanced large language models (LLMs) frequently reflect in reasoning
chain-of-thoughts (CoTs), where they self-verify the correctness of current
solutions and explore alternatives. However, given recent findings that LLMs
detect limited errors in CoTs, how reflection contributes to empirical
improvements remains unclear. To analyze this issue, in this paper, we present
a minimalistic reasoning framework to support basic self-verifying reflection
for small transformers without natural language, which ensures analytic clarity
and reduces the cost of comprehensive experiments. Theoretically, we prove that
self-verifying reflection guarantees improvements if verification errors are
properly bounded. Experimentally, we show that tiny transformers, with only a
few million parameters, benefit from self-verification in both training and
reflective execution, reaching remarkable LLM-level performance in integer
multiplication and Sudoku. Similar to LLM results, we find that reinforcement
learning (RL) improves in-distribution performance and incentivizes frequent
reflection for tiny transformers, yet RL mainly optimizes shallow statistical
patterns without faithfully reducing verification errors. In conclusion,
integrating generative transformers with discriminative verification inherently
facilitates CoT reasoning, regardless of scaling and natural language.

### [42] [Revisiting Meta-Learning with Noisy Labels: Reweighting Dynamics and Theoretical Guarantees](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12209)
*Yiming Zhang,Chester Holtz,Gal Mishne,Alex Cloninger*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文对元学习样本重加权方法在标签噪声下的训练动态进行了理论分析，揭示了其三个阶段的训练轨迹，并提出了一个轻量级替代方法，在多个噪声标签基准测试中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于过参数化网络会记忆被污染的监督信号，带噪声标签的学习仍然具有挑战性。元学习样本重加权方法虽然通过使用少量干净子集来指导训练来缓解这一问题，但其行为和训练动态缺乏理论理解。

Method: 对元重加权在标签噪声下的训练轨迹进行严格理论分析，揭示了三个训练阶段：对齐阶段、过滤阶段和后过滤阶段。基于分析提出了一个轻量级替代方法，集成了均值中心化、行移位和标签符号调制，避免了昂贵的双层优化。

Result: 在合成和真实噪声标签基准测试中，所提出的方法始终优于强大的重加权/选择基线方法。

Conclusion: 元重加权的机制是基于训练信号和干净子集信号之间的相似性加权耦合以及干净子集训练损失的收缩；在后过滤机制中，当干净子集损失足够小时，耦合项消失，元重加权失去区分能力。所提出的轻量级替代方法提供了更稳定的性能。

Abstract: Learning with noisy labels remains challenging because over-parameterized
networks memorize corrupted supervision. Meta-learning-based sample reweighting
mitigates this by using a small clean subset to guide training, yet its
behavior and training dynamics lack theoretical understanding. We provide a
rigorous theoretical analysis of meta-reweighting under label noise and show
that its training trajectory unfolds in three phases: (i) an alignment phase
that amplifies examples consistent with a clean subset and suppresses
conflicting ones; (ii) a filtering phase driving noisy example weights toward
zero until the clean subset loss plateaus; and (iii) a post-filtering phase in
which noise filtration becomes perturbation-sensitive. The mechanism is a
similarity-weighted coupling between training and clean subset signals together
with clean subset training loss contraction; in the post-filtering regime where
the clean-subset loss is sufficiently small, the coupling term vanishes and
meta-reweighting loses discriminatory power. Guided by this analysis, we
propose a lightweight surrogate for meta-reweighting that integrates
mean-centering, row shifting, and label-signed modulation, yielding more stable
performance while avoiding expensive bi-level optimization. Across synthetic
and real noisy-label benchmarks, our method consistently outperforms strong
reweighting/selection baselines.

Conclusion: DE3S方法通过创新的形状学习框架成功解决了医疗早期时间序列分类中的准确性和早期性权衡问题，具有强大的鲁棒性和实用性。

Abstract: Early time-series classification (ETSC) in medical applications is crucial
for time-sensitive scenarios such as sepsis prediction in intensive care units
(ICUs), where a large number of deaths are caused by delayed prediction. ETSC
can significantly improve ICU resource utilization efficiency and healthcare
precision. However, it faces conflicting goals of accuracy and earliness, with
existing methods often trading one for the other, struggling to capture subtle
early-stage patterns due to weak initial signals and class imbalance. The key
to solve these challenges is to find shapelets, which are discriminative
subsequences (or shapes) with high interpretability in time-series
classification. This paper proposes Dual-Enhanced Soft-Sparse-Shape Learning
for Medical Early Time-Series Classification (DE3S), which introduces a novel
Dual-Enhanced Soft-Shape Learning framework to figure out shapelets precisely
through three innovations: (1) a comprehensive dual-enhancement strategy
combines traditional temporal augmentation with attention-based global temporal
enhancement for robust representation learning, (2) an attention-score-based
soft shapelet sparsification mechanism dynamically preserves discriminative
patterns while aggregating less important shapelets into representative tokens,
and (3) a dual-path Mixture of Experts Network (MoE) and Inception modules
fusion architecture where MoE performs local learning within shapelets and
multi-scale Inception modules capture global patterns across shapelets. The
framework employs weighted cross-entropy loss for class imbalance handling and
demonstrates robustness on subject-consistency datasets. Extensive experiments
on six real-world medical datasets show state-of-the-art performance, with
ablation studies confirming component efficacy.

Motivation: 解决扩散模型采样速度慢的问题，同时保留扩散动态的可解释性和细粒度控制能力，这些是支持可编辑生成等应用的关键优势。

Method: 基于Koopman算子理论，将非线性扩散动态提升到潜在空间，使用全局线性算子控制演化；设计分层架构，通过尺度特定Koopman子空间在不同空间分辨率上解耦生成动态。

Result: 实现了竞争性的一步生成性能，同时通过谱分析提供了理解和操作生成过程的原理机制。

Conclusion: 该框架弥合了扩散模型中快速采样和可解释性之间的差距，为生成建模中的可解释图像合成铺平了道路。

Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved impressive success in high-fidelity image
generation but suffer from slow sampling due to their inherently iterative
denoising process. While recent one-step methods accelerate inference by
learning direct noise-to-image mappings, they sacrifice the interpretability
and fine-grained control intrinsic to diffusion dynamics, key advantages that
enable applications like editable generation. To resolve this dichotomy, we
introduce \textbf{Hierarchical Koopman Diffusion}, a novel framework that
achieves both one-step sampling and interpretable generative trajectories.
Grounded in Koopman operator theory, our method lifts the nonlinear diffusion
dynamics into a latent space where evolution is governed by globally linear
operators, enabling closed-form trajectory solutions. This formulation not only
eliminates iterative sampling but also provides full access to intermediate
states, allowing manual intervention during generation. To model the
multi-scale nature of images, we design a hierarchical architecture that
disentangles generative dynamics across spatial resolutions via scale-specific
Koopman subspaces, capturing coarse-to-fine details systematically. We
empirically show that the Hierarchical Koopman Diffusion not only achieves
competitive one-step generation performance but also provides a principled
mechanism for interpreting and manipulating the generative process through
spectral analysis. Our framework bridges the gap between fast sampling and
interpretability in diffusion models, paving the way for explainable image
synthesis in generative modeling.

Motivation: Graph-LLM结合了图神经网络和大语言模型，在文本属性图上表现出色，但这种复杂协同引入了关键漏洞，现有攻击方法只针对结构或文本单一方面，缺乏统一的多维度攻击框架

Method: IMDGA框架包含三个紧密集成的模块，协调执行图结构和文本特征的多层次扰动，在保持可解释性的同时平衡攻击影响

Result: 通过理论分析和多数据集、多架构的实证评估，IMDGA在可解释性、攻击效果、隐蔽性和鲁棒性方面优于现有方法

Conclusion: 这项工作揭示了Graph-LLM中以前未被充分探索的语义维度漏洞，为提升其韧性提供了宝贵见解

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have become a pivotal framework for modeling
graph-structured data, enabling a wide range of applications from social
network analysis to molecular chemistry. By integrating large language models
(LLMs), text-attributed graphs (TAGs) enhance node representations with rich
textual semantics, significantly boosting the expressive power of graph-based
learning. However, this sophisticated synergy introduces critical
vulnerabilities, as Graph-LLMs are susceptible to adversarial attacks on both
their structural topology and textual attributes. Although specialized attack
methods have been designed for each of these aspects, no work has yet unified
them into a comprehensive approach. In this work, we propose the Interpretable
Multi-Dimensional Graph Attack (IMDGA), a novel human-centric adversarial
attack framework designed to orchestrate multi-level perturbations across both
graph structure and textual features. IMDGA utilizes three tightly integrated
modules to craft attacks that balance interpretability and impact, enabling a
deeper understanding of Graph-LLM vulnerabilities. Through rigorous theoretical
analysis and comprehensive empirical evaluations on diverse datasets and
architectures, IMDGA demonstrates superior interpretability, attack
effectiveness, stealthiness, and robustness compared to existing methods. By
exposing critical weaknesses in TAG representation learning, this work uncovers
a previously underexplored semantic dimension of vulnerability in Graph-LLMs,
offering valuable insights for improving their resilience. Our code and

Motivation: 解决现有多模态对齐方法在处理分子图结构时的两个主要局限：共享参数空间限制了捕获实例特定结构特征的能力，以及微调LLM可能导致灾难性遗忘。

Method: MoRA方法为每个输入分子图生成独特的低秩自适应权重，动态注入冻结的LLM中，实现实例特定的动态适应。

Conclusion: MoRA的实例特定动态适应优于静态适应基线，能够保持LLM核心知识的同时适应每个分子输入的结构。

Abstract: Effectively integrating molecular graph structures with Large Language Models
(LLMs) is a key challenge in drug discovery. Most existing multi-modal
alignment methods typically process these structures by fine-tuning the LLM or
adding a static adapter simultaneously. However, these approaches have two main
limitations: (1) it optimizes a shared parameter space across all molecular
inputs, limiting the model's ability to capture instance-specific structural
features; and (2) fine-tuning the LLM for molecular tasks can lead to
catastrophic forgetting, undermining its general reasoning capabilities. In
this paper, instead of static task-oriented adaptation, we propose an
instance-specific parameter space alignment approach for each molecule
on-the-fly. To this end, we introduce Molecule-aware Low-Rank Adaptation (MoRA)
that produces a unique set of low-rank adaptation weights for each input
molecular graph. These weights are then dynamically injected into a frozen LLM,
allowing the model to adapt its reasoning to the structure of each molecular
input, while preserving the LLM's core knowledge. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that on key molecular tasks, such as chemical reaction prediction
and molecular captioning, MoRA's instance-specific dynamic adaptation
outperforms statically adapted baselines, including a 14.1% relative
improvement in reaction prediction exact match and a 22% reduction in error for
quantum property prediction. The code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在执行性学习中，数据分布会因部署的模型而发生变化（如策略性用户调整特征），这比传统监督学习更复杂。需要同时优化当前数据模型并考虑模型可能引导分布变化的方向。

Method: 通过高维岭回归分析正则化对执行性效应的影响，研究正则化参数如何随执行性效应强度变化，并在合成和真实数据集上进行实证评估。

Result: 执行性效应在总体设置下会恶化测试风险，但在过参数化机制（特征数超过样本数）中可能有益。最优正则化与执行性效应强度成正比。

Conclusion: 正则化可以有效应对执行性效应，特别是在过参数化情况下。可以通过预估执行性效应强度来设置最优正则化参数，这在理论和实证上都得到了验证。

Abstract: In performative learning, the data distribution reacts to the deployed model
- for example, because strategic users adapt their features to game it - which
creates a more complex dynamic than in classical supervised learning. One
should thus not only optimize the model for the current data but also take into
account that the model might steer the distribution in a new direction, without
knowing the exact nature of the potential shift. We explore how regularization
can help cope with performative effects by studying its impact in
high-dimensional ridge regression. We show that, while performative effects
worsen the test risk in the population setting, they can be beneficial in the
over-parameterized regime where the number of features exceeds the number of
samples. We show that the optimal regularization scales with the overall
strength of the performative effect, making it possible to set the
regularization in anticipation of this effect. We illustrate this finding
through empirical evaluations of the optimal regularization parameter on both
synthetic and real-world datasets.

Abstract: Diffusion Models (DMs), as a leading class of generative models, offer key
advantages for reinforcement learning (RL), including multi-modal
expressiveness, stable training, and trajectory-level planning. This survey
delivers a comprehensive and up-to-date synthesis of diffusion-based RL. We
first provide an overview of RL, highlighting its challenges, and then
introduce the fundamental concepts of DMs, investigating how they are
integrated into RL frameworks to address key challenges in this research field.
We establish a dual-axis taxonomy that organizes the field along two orthogonal
dimensions: a function-oriented taxonomy that clarifies the roles DMs play
within the RL pipeline, and a technique-oriented taxonomy that situates
implementations across online versus offline learning regimes. We also provide
a comprehensive examination of this progression from single-agent to
multi-agent domains, thereby forming several frameworks for DM-RL integration
and highlighting their practical utility. Furthermore, we outline several
categories of successful applications of diffusion-based RL across diverse
domains, discuss open research issues of current methodologies, and highlight
key directions for future research to advance the field. Finally, we summarize
the survey to identify promising future development directions. We are actively

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LoRA重用方法需要显式任务标签或额外训练，且通常激活固定数量的完整LoRA模块，导致参数冗余或不足而降低性能。

Method: 定义秩一组件(ROCs)，在序列级自适应选择LoRA子集并确定ROC分配，在token级进一步细化路由，仅激活最有信息的ROCs。

Result: 在领域泛化任务中取得显著改进，比最先进基线准确率提升高达55%，同时保持相当的推理吞吐量。

Conclusion: HiLoRA提供了一种无需训练的高效LoRA重用方法，通过分层路由机制解决了参数冗余问题，在理论和实验上都证明了其有效性。

Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has emerged as a widely used technique for
adapting large language models (LLMs) to new domains, due to its modular design
and broad availability on platforms such as HuggingFace. This availability has
motivated efforts to reuse existing LoRAs for domain generalization.
  However, existing methods often rely on explicit task labels or additional
training, which are impractical for deployment. Moreover, they typically
activate a fixed number of entire LoRA modules, leading to parameter redundancy
or insufficiency that degrade performance.
  In this paper, we propose \texttt{HiLoRA}, a training-free framework that
performs adaptive hierarchical routing over LoRA pools. Drawing on structural
properties of LoRA, we define rank-one components (ROCs), in which each rank
parameter is regarded as an independent unit. For a given input sequence,
\texttt{HiLoRA} first adaptively selects a subset of LoRAs and determines their
ROC allocation based on Gaussian likelihoods at the sequence level. At the
token level, it further refines routing by activating only the most informative
ROCs.
  We further provide theoretical guarantees that \texttt{HiLoRA} selects the
most relevant LoRAs with high probability.
  Extensive experiments show that \texttt{HiLoRA} achieves substantial
improvements in domain generalization, with accuracy gains of up to {\small
$55\%$} over state-of-the-art baselines, while maintaining comparable inference
throughput.

Abstract: Self-improvement has emerged as a state-of-the-art paradigm in Neural
Combinatorial Optimization (NCO), where models iteratively refine their
policies by generating and imitating high-quality solutions. Despite strong
empirical performance, existing methods face key limitations. Training is
computationally expensive, as policy updates require sampling numerous
candidate solutions per instance to extract a single expert trajectory. More
fundamentally, these approaches fail to exploit the structure of combinatorial
problems involving the coordination of multiple agents, such as vehicles in
min-max routing or machines in scheduling. By supervising on single-action
trajectories, they fail to exploit agent-permutation symmetries, where distinct
sequences of actions yield identical solutions, hindering generalization and
the ability to learn coordinated behavior.
  We address these challenges by extending self-improvement to operate over
joint multi-agent actions. Our model architecture predicts complete agent-task
assignments jointly at each decision step. To explicitly leverage symmetries,
we employ a set-prediction loss, which supervises the policy on multiple expert
assignments for any given state. This approach enhances sample efficiency and
the model's ability to learn coordinated behavior. Furthermore, by generating
multi-agent actions in parallel, it drastically accelerates the solution
generation phase of the self-improvement loop. Empirically, we validate our
method on several combinatorial problems, demonstrating consistent improvements
in the quality of the final solution and a reduced generation latency compared
to standard self-improvement.

Conclusion: GFF-PIELM成功扩展了PIELM解决高频和变频PDE的能力，其初始化策略可能启发其他物理信息机器学习框架的进展。

Abstract: Conventional physics-informed extreme learning machine (PIELM) often faces
challenges in solving partial differential equations (PDEs) involving
high-frequency and variable-frequency behaviors. To address these challenges,
we propose a general Fourier feature physics-informed extreme learning machine
(GFF-PIELM). We demonstrate that directly concatenating multiple Fourier
feature mappings (FFMs) and an extreme learning machine (ELM) network makes it
difficult to determine frequency-related hyperparameters. Fortunately, we find
an alternative to establish the GFF-PIELM in three main steps. First, we
integrate a variation of FFM into ELM as the Fourier-based activation function,
so there is still one hidden layer in the GFF-PIELM framework. Second, we
assign a set of frequency coefficients to the hidden neurons, which enables ELM
network to capture diverse frequency components of target solutions. Finally,
we develop an innovative, straightforward initialization method for these
hyperparameters by monitoring the distribution of ELM output weights. GFF-PIELM
not only retains the high accuracy, efficiency, and simplicity of the PIELM
framework but also inherits the ability of FFMs to effectively handle
high-frequency problems. We carry out five case studies with a total of ten
numerical examples to highlight the feasibility and validity of the proposed
GFF-PIELM, involving high frequency, variable frequency, multi-scale behaviour,
irregular boundary and inverse problems. Compared to conventional PIELM, the
GFF-PIELM approach significantly improves predictive accuracy without
additional cost in training time and architecture complexity. Our results
confirm that that PIELM can be extended to solve high-frequency and
variable-frequency PDEs with high accuracy, and our initialization strategy may
further inspire advances in other physics-informed machine learning (PIML)
frameworks.

Abstract: Safe policy improvement (SPI) offers theoretical control over policy updates,
yet existing guarantees largely concern offline, tabular reinforcement learning
(RL). We study SPI in general online settings, when combined with world model
and representation learning. We develop a theoretical framework showing that
restricting policy updates to a well-defined neighborhood of the current policy
ensures monotonic improvement and convergence. This analysis links transition
and reward prediction losses to representation quality, yielding online, "deep"
analogues of classical SPI theorems from the offline RL literature. Building on
these results, we introduce DeepSPI, a principled on-policy algorithm that
couples local transition and reward losses with regularised policy updates. On
the ALE-57 benchmark, DeepSPI matches or exceeds strong baselines, including
PPO and DeepMDPs, while retaining theoretical guarantees.

Abstract: Accurate rainfall forecasting, particularly for extreme events, remains a
significant challenge in climatology and the Earth system. This paper presents
novel physics-informed Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) combined with extreme-value
analysis techniques to improve gauge-station rainfall predictions across
Thailand. The model leverages a graph-structured representation of gauge
stations to capture complex spatiotemporal patterns, and it offers
explainability through teleconnections. We preprocess relevant climate indices
that potentially influence regional rainfall. The proposed Graph Attention
Network with Long Short-Term Memory (Attention-LSTM) applies the attention
mechanism using initial edge features derived from simple
orographic-precipitation physics formulation. The embeddings are subsequently
processed by LSTM layers. To address extremes, we perform Peak-Over-Threshold
(POT) mapping using the novel Spatial Season-aware Generalized Pareto
Distribution (GPD) method, which overcomes limitations of traditional
machine-learning models. Experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms
well-established baselines across most regions, including areas prone to
extremes, and remains strongly competitive with the state of the art. Compared
with the operational forecasting system SEAS5, our real-world application
improves extreme-event prediction and offers a practical enhancement to produce
fine-resolution maps that support decision-making in long-term water

### [55] [Finite-time Convergence Analysis of Actor-Critic with Evolving Reward](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12334)
*Rui Hu,Yu Chen,Longbo Huang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 首次对具有演化奖励函数的单时间尺度actor-critic算法进行有限时间收敛分析，证明在马尔可夫采样下可实现O(1/√T)收敛速率，与静态奖励的最佳速率匹配。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 许多实用的强化学习算法使用演化奖励函数（如奖励塑造、熵正则化、课程学习），但其理论基础尚不完善。

Method: 在马尔可夫采样下分析单时间尺度actor-critic算法，考虑每个时间步可能变化的奖励参数对策略优化和价值估计的影响。

Result: 在标准假设下，推导了actor和critic误差的非渐近界，证明只要奖励参数演化足够慢，就能实现O(1/√T)收敛速率。

Conclusion: 为许多流行的RL技术提供了理论基础，并在静态奖励情况下改进了分布不匹配分析，将最佳已知速率提高了log²T倍。

Abstract: Many popular practical reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms employ evolving
reward functions-through techniques such as reward shaping, entropy
regularization, or curriculum learning-yet their theoretical foundations remain
underdeveloped. This paper provides the first finite-time convergence analysis
of a single-timescale actor-critic algorithm in the presence of an evolving
reward function under Markovian sampling. We consider a setting where the
reward parameters may change at each time step, affecting both policy
optimization and value estimation. Under standard assumptions, we derive
non-asymptotic bounds for both actor and critic errors. Our result shows that
an $O(1/\sqrt{T})$ convergence rate is achievable, matching the best-known rate
for static rewards, provided the reward parameters evolve slowly enough. This
rate is preserved when the reward is updated via a gradient-based rule with
bounded gradient and on the same timescale as the actor and critic, offering a
theoretical foundation for many popular RL techniques. As a secondary
contribution, we introduce a novel analysis of distribution mismatch under
Markovian sampling, improving the best-known rate by a factor of $\log^2T$ in
the static-reward case.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出基于TSP的token重排序策略和后续处理步骤，解决加密文本生成中的挑战，特别是下一词预测问题，提升生成文本的连贯性并保护数据隐私。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着用户越来越多地使用私有信息与大型语言模型交互，安全加密通信变得至关重要。同态加密虽然能直接在加密数据上计算，但文本生成特别是下一词预测仍是实际加密交互的主要障碍。

Method: 采用基于TSP的token重排序策略来处理加密文本生成的困难，并加入后续处理步骤进一步减少近似误差。

Result: 理论分析和实验结果表明，该方法防止了模型崩溃，提高了生成文本的连贯性，并在整个过程中保持了数据隐私。

Conclusion: 这项工作推进了实用且保护隐私的LLM推理的可行性。

Abstract: As users increasingly interact with large language models (LLMs) using
private information, secure and encrypted communication becomes essential.
Homomorphic encryption (HE) provides a principled solution by enabling
computation directly on encrypted data. Although prior work has explored
aspects of running LLMs under HE, the challenge of text generation,
particularly next-token prediction, has received limited attention and remains
a key obstacle to practical encrypted interaction. In this work, we propose a
TSP-based token reordering strategy to address the difficulties of encrypted
text generation, together with a post-processing step that further reduces
approximation error. Theoretical analysis and experimental results demonstrate
that our method prevents collapse, improves coherence in generated text, and
preserves data privacy throughout. Overall, our contributions advance the
feasibility of practical and privacy-preserving LLM inference.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大规模组织中多模态数据（如图像、表格、文本）共存的跨模态错误检测问题，传统方法通常只关注单一模态，无法有效检测跨模态错误。

Method: 在四个数据集上对五种基线方法进行基准测试，包括Cleanlab标签错误检测框架和DataScope数据评估方法，结合AutoML框架进行评估。

Result: Cleanlab和DataScope在搭配强大AutoML框架时表现最佳，获得最高的F1分数，但现有方法在处理重尾真实世界数据时仍有局限性。

Conclusion: 当前跨模态错误检测方法仍有不足，特别是在处理真实世界重尾数据方面，需要进一步研究改进。

Abstract: Ensuring data quality at scale remains a persistent challenge for large
organizations. Despite recent advances, maintaining accurate and consistent
data is still complex, especially when dealing with multiple data modalities.
Traditional error detection and correction methods tend to focus on a single
modality, typically a table, and often miss cross-modal errors that are common
in domains like e-Commerce and healthcare, where image, tabular, and text data
co-exist. To address this gap, we take an initial step towards cross-modal
error detection in tabular data, by benchmarking several methods. Our
evaluation spans four datasets and five baseline approaches. Among them,
Cleanlab, a label error detection framework, and DataScope, a data valuation
method, perform the best when paired with a strong AutoML framework, achieving
the highest F1 scores. Our findings indicate that current methods remain
limited, particularly when applied to heavy-tailed real-world data, motivating
further research in this area.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有GNN预训练方法主要针对同质图设计，而现实图多为异质图，且存在语义不匹配问题（原始数据与理想可迁移数据之间的语义差异）。

Method: 设计结构感知预训练任务捕获异质图结构特性；构建语义邻居组成的扰动子空间来处理语义不匹配，使模型更关注语义空间中的通用知识。

Result: 在真实世界大规模异质图上的广泛实验表明，该方法优于现有最先进基线方法。

Conclusion: 提出的框架能有效预训练异质图神经网络，解决语义不匹配问题，提升知识迁移能力。

Abstract: In recent years, graph neural networks (GNNs) have facilitated the
development of graph data mining. However, training GNNs requires sufficient
labeled task-specific data, which is expensive and sometimes unavailable. To be
less dependent on labeled data, recent studies propose to pre-train GNNs in a
self-supervised manner and then apply the pre-trained GNNs to downstream tasks
with limited labeled data. However, most existing methods are designed solely
for homogeneous graphs (real-world graphs are mostly heterogeneous) and do not
consider semantic mismatch (the semantic difference between the original data
and the ideal data containing more transferable semantic information). In this
paper, we propose an effective framework to pre-train GNNs on the large-scale
heterogeneous graph. We first design a structure-aware pre-training task, which
aims to capture structural properties in heterogeneous graphs. Then, we design
a semantic-aware pre-training task to tackle the mismatch. Specifically, we
construct a perturbation subspace composed of semantic neighbors to help deal
with the semantic mismatch. Semantic neighbors make the model focus more on the
general knowledge in the semantic space, which in turn assists the model in
learning knowledge with better transferability. Finally, extensive experiments
are conducted on real-world large-scale heterogeneous graphs to demonstrate the
superiority of the proposed method over state-of-the-art baselines. Code

### [59] [Cautious Weight Decay](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12402)
*Lizhang Chen,Jonathan Li,Kaizhao Liang,Baiyu Su,Cong Xie,Nuo Wang Pierse,Chen Liang,Ni Lao,Qiang Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Cautious Weight Decay (CWD) 是一种只需一行代码的优化器无关修改，仅在参数坐标符号与优化器更新一致时应用权重衰减，相比标准解耦衰减能更好地保持原始损失函数并找到帕累托最优解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准解耦权重衰减会隐式优化正则化或约束目标，改变原始损失函数。CWD旨在保持原始损失函数的同时实现更好的优化效果。

Method: CWD仅在参数坐标符号与优化器更新一致时应用权重衰减，这允许在到达平稳流形时产生滑动模式行为，从而搜索未修改目标的局部帕累托最优平稳点。

Result: 在语言模型预训练和ImageNet分类任务中，CWD在百万到十亿参数规模下持续改善最终损失和准确率，且无需新超参数或额外调优。

Conclusion: CWD是一种简单有效的优化器改进方法，可作为AdamW、Lion和Muon等优化器的即插即用替换，在各种规模任务中都能带来性能提升。

Abstract: We introduce Cautious Weight Decay (CWD), a one-line, optimizer-agnostic
modification that applies weight decay only to parameter coordinates whose
signs align with the optimizer update. Unlike standard decoupled decay, which
implicitly optimizes a regularized or constrained objective, CWD preserves the
original loss and admits a bilevel interpretation: it induces sliding-mode
behavior upon reaching the stationary manifold, allowing it to search for
locally Pareto-optimal stationary points of the unmodified objective. In
practice, CWD is a drop-in change for optimizers such as AdamW, Lion, and Muon,
requiring no new hyperparameters or additional tuning. For language model
pre-training and ImageNet classification, CWD consistently improves final loss
and accuracy at million- to billion-parameter scales.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前用于评估生成式AI模型生成晶体材料的距离函数存在四个主要问题：无法量化相似度、不能区分成分和结构差异、缺乏对原子坐标变化的连续性、以及独特性指标对样本排列不具不变性。

Method: 提出了两种连续距离函数来评估晶体材料的独特性和新颖性，这些函数在理论上克服了传统距离函数的局限性。

Result: 实验表明，新提出的距离函数能够揭示传统距离函数所忽略的洞察，为评估和比较无机晶体的生成模型提供了更可靠的基础。

Conclusion: 连续距离函数为生成式AI模型在功能材料发现领域的评估提供了更准确和可靠的度量标准。

Abstract: To address pressing scientific challenges such as climate change,
increasingly sophisticated generative artificial intelligence models are being
developed that can efficiently sample the large chemical space of possible
functional materials. These models can quickly sample new chemical compositions
paired with crystal structures. They are typically evaluated using uniqueness
and novelty metrics, which depend on a chosen crystal distance function.
However, the most prevalent distance function has four limitations: it fails to
quantify the degree of similarity between compounds, cannot distinguish
compositional difference and structural difference, lacks Lipschitz continuity
against shifts in atomic coordinates, and results in a uniqueness metric that
is not invariant against the permutation of generated samples. In this work, we
propose using two continuous distance functions to evaluate uniqueness and
novelty, which theoretically overcome these limitations. Our experiments show
that these distances reveal insights missed by traditional distance functions,
providing a more reliable basis for evaluating and comparing generative models
for inorganic crystals.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出基于高斯过程的非参数动态定价方法，使用贝叶斯优化来学习未知需求函数，在无限和有限库存场景中都优于传统强化学习方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统动态定价方法通常假设需求函数具有特定参数形式，这在现实场景中可能不成立，限制了方法的适用性。

Method: 使用高斯过程对需求函数进行非参数建模，基于贝叶斯优化开发定价算法，适用于无限和有限库存两种场景。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在收益方面优于多种最先进的强化学习算法，需要更少的假设且具有更强的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 贝叶斯优化是复杂不确定环境中动态定价的强大实用工具，提供了后悔保证来量化学习效率。

Abstract: Dynamic pricing is the practice of adjusting the selling price of a product
to maximize a firm's revenue by responding to market demand. The literature
typically distinguishes between two settings: infinite inventory, where the
firm has unlimited stock and time to sell, and finite inventory, where both
inventory and selling horizon are limited. In both cases, the central challenge
lies in the fact that the demand function -- how sales respond to price -- is
unknown and must be learned from data. Traditional approaches often assume a
specific parametric form for the demand function, enabling the use of
reinforcement learning (RL) to identify near-optimal pricing strategies.
However, such assumptions may not hold in real-world scenarios, limiting the
applicability of these methods. In this work, we propose a Gaussian Process
(GP) based nonparametric approach to dynamic pricing that avoids restrictive
modeling assumptions. We treat the demand function as a black-box function of
the price and develop pricing algorithms based on Bayesian Optimization (BO) --
a sample-efficient method for optimizing unknown functions. We present BO-based
algorithms tailored for both infinite and finite inventory settings and provide
regret guarantees for both regimes, thereby quantifying the learning efficiency
of our methods. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our BO-based
methods outperform several state-of-the-art RL algorithms in terms of revenue,
while requiring fewer assumptions and offering greater robustness. This
highlights Bayesian Optimization as a powerful and practical tool for dynamic
pricing in complex, uncertain environments.

*Israel Mason-Williams,Gabryel Mason-Williams,Helen Yannakoudakis*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文重新审视了平坦最小值与泛化能力的关系，发现正则化方法（如SAM、权重衰减、数据增强）往往产生更尖锐的最小值，但这些尖锐最小值反而具有更好的泛化性、校准性、鲁棒性和功能一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 重新评估尖锐度在模型性能中的作用，挑战平坦最小值必然带来更好泛化的传统观点，提出尖锐度应被视为函数依赖属性而非泛化能力的可靠指标。

Method: 进行了广泛的实证研究，从单目标优化到现代图像分类任务，比较了使用不同正则化方法（SAM、权重衰减、数据增强）的模型与无正则化基线的表现。

Result: 发现正则化模型倾向于收敛到更尖锐的最小值，但这些尖锐最小值在泛化、校准、鲁棒性和功能一致性方面表现更好；而无正则化的基线模型虽然收敛到更平坦的最小值，但在所有安全指标上表现更差。

Conclusion: 函数复杂性而非平坦度单独决定了解的几何形状，尖锐最小值可以反映更合适的归纳偏置（特别是在正则化下），需要对损失景观几何进行以函数为中心的重新评估。

Abstract: Flat minima are widely believed to correlate with improved generalisation in
deep neural networks. However, this connection has proven more nuanced in
recent studies, with both theoretical counterexamples and empirical exceptions
emerging in the literature. In this paper, we revisit the role of sharpness in
model performance, proposing that sharpness is better understood as a
function-dependent property rather than a reliable indicator of poor
generalisation. We conduct extensive empirical studies, from single-objective
optimisation to modern image classification tasks, showing that sharper minima
often emerge when models are regularised (e.g., via SAM, weight decay, or data
augmentation), and that these sharp minima can coincide with better
generalisation, calibration, robustness, and functional consistency. Across a
range of models and datasets, we find that baselines without regularisation
tend to converge to flatter minima yet often perform worse across all safety
metrics. Our findings demonstrate that function complexity, rather than
flatness alone, governs the geometry of solutions, and that sharper minima can
reflect more appropriate inductive biases (especially under regularisation),
calling for a function-centric reappraisal of loss landscape geometry.

TL;DR: 提出TCVBM框架，将桥匹配扩展到时间相关视频序列，解决传统扩散模型在数据间转换任务中的局限性，在视频帧插值、图像到视频生成和视频超分辨率任务中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型擅长从噪声生成数据，但在复杂分布间的转换任务中表现不佳。桥匹配模型虽然能解决数据分布间的转换问题，但尚未应用于时间相关数据序列，这在需要保持时间一致性的视频任务中尤为关键。

Method: 提出时间相关视频桥匹配(TCVBM)框架，在扩散桥中显式建模序列间依赖关系，将时间相关性直接融入采样过程，专门针对视频领域的时间相关数据序列设计。

Result: 在视频帧插值、图像到视频生成和视频超分辨率三个任务中，TCVBM在多个定量指标上均优于基于桥匹配和扩散模型的传统方法，展现出更好的生成质量和重建保真度。

Conclusion: TCVBM成功将桥匹配扩展到时间相关视频序列，有效解决了视频任务中的时间一致性保持问题，为视频生成和操作任务提供了更优的解决方案。

Abstract: Diffusion models excel in noise-to-data generation tasks, providing a mapping
from a Gaussian distribution to a more complex data distribution. However they
struggle to model translations between complex distributions, limiting their
effectiveness in data-to-data tasks. While Bridge Matching (BM) models address
this by finding the translation between data distributions, their application
to time-correlated data sequences remains unexplored. This is a critical
limitation for video generation and manipulation tasks, where maintaining
temporal coherence is particularly important. To address this gap, we propose
Time-Correlated Video Bridge Matching (TCVBM), a framework that extends BM to
time-correlated data sequences in the video domain. TCVBM explicitly models
inter-sequence dependencies within the diffusion bridge, directly incorporating
temporal correlations into the sampling process. We compare our approach to
classical methods based on bridge matching and diffusion models for three
video-related tasks: frame interpolation, image-to-video generation, and video
super-resolution. TCVBM achieves superior performance across multiple
quantitative metrics, demonstrating enhanced generation quality and
reconstruction fidelity.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在多尺度建模时往往独立处理各尺度信息或使用简单特征融合，忽略了异常期间跨尺度关联的动态变化，且大多基于固定滑动窗口限制了上下文信息捕捉能力。

Method: 提出跨尺度重建方法，从粗粒度序列重建细粒度序列以显式捕捉跨尺度关联；设计查询库并整合全局多尺度上下文来克服固定窗口限制。

Result: 在多个真实世界数据集上使用九种评估指标进行广泛实验，验证了CrossAD的有效性，在异常检测方面展现出最先进的性能。

Conclusion: CrossAD框架通过有效建模跨尺度关联和跨窗口上下文，显著提升了时间序列异常检测的性能，为多尺度建模提供了新的思路。

Abstract: Time series anomaly detection plays a crucial role in a wide range of
real-world applications. Given that time series data can exhibit different
patterns at different sampling granularities, multi-scale modeling has proven
beneficial for uncovering latent anomaly patterns that may not be apparent at a
single scale. However, existing methods often model multi-scale information
independently or rely on simple feature fusion strategies, neglecting the
dynamic changes in cross-scale associations that occur during anomalies.
Moreover, most approaches perform multi-scale modeling based on fixed sliding
windows, which limits their ability to capture comprehensive contextual
information. In this work, we propose CrossAD, a novel framework for time
series Anomaly Detection that takes Cross-scale associations and Cross-window
modeling into account. We propose a cross-scale reconstruction that
reconstructs fine-grained series from coarser series, explicitly capturing
cross-scale associations. Furthermore, we design a query library and
incorporate global multi-scale context to overcome the limitations imposed by
fixed window sizes. Extensive experiments conducted on multiple real-world
datasets using nine evaluation metrics validate the effectiveness of CrossAD,
demonstrating state-of-the-art performance in anomaly detection.

Motivation: 现有去噪生成模型在求解离散化反向时间SDE或ODE时，存在预定义噪声水平与中间状态实际噪声水平不匹配的问题，这种噪声偏移导致次优生成结果。

Method: 提出噪声感知引导(NAG)方法，明确引导采样轨迹与预定义噪声调度保持一致；并引入无分类器变体，通过噪声条件dropout联合训练噪声条件和非条件模型。

Result: 在ImageNet生成和各种监督微调任务上的广泛实验表明，NAG能持续缓解噪声偏移，显著提升主流扩散模型的生成质量。

Conclusion: 噪声偏移是扩散模型中普遍存在但被忽视的问题，NAG提供了一种简单有效的校正方法，能够改善模型性能。

Abstract: Existing denoising generative models rely on solving discretized reverse-time
SDEs or ODEs. In this paper, we identify a long-overlooked yet pervasive issue
in this family of models: a misalignment between the pre-defined noise level
and the actual noise level encoded in intermediate states during sampling. We
refer to this misalignment as noise shift. Through empirical analysis, we
demonstrate that noise shift is widespread in modern diffusion models and
exhibits a systematic bias, leading to sub-optimal generation due to both
out-of-distribution generalization and inaccurate denoising updates. To address
this problem, we propose Noise Awareness Guidance (NAG), a simple yet effective
correction method that explicitly steers sampling trajectories to remain
consistent with the pre-defined noise schedule. We further introduce a
classifier-free variant of NAG, which jointly trains a noise-conditional and a
noise-unconditional model via noise-condition dropout, thereby eliminating the
need for external classifiers. Extensive experiments, including ImageNet
generation and various supervised fine-tuning tasks, show that NAG consistently
mitigates noise shift and substantially improves the generation quality of
mainstream diffusion models.

Abstract: Causal discovery aims to learn causal relationships between variables from
targeted data, making it a fundamental task in machine learning. However,
causal discovery algorithms often rely on unverifiable causal assumptions,
which are usually difficult to satisfy in real-world data, thereby limiting the
broad application of causal discovery in practical scenarios. Inspired by these
considerations, this work extensively benchmarks the empirical performance of
various mainstream causal discovery algorithms, which assume i.i.d. data, under
eight model assumption violations. Our experimental results show that
differentiable causal discovery methods exhibit robustness under the metrics of
Structural Hamming Distance and Structural Intervention Distance of the
inferred graphs in commonly used challenging scenarios, except for scale
variation. We also provide the theoretical explanations for the performance of
differentiable causal discovery methods. Finally, our work aims to
comprehensively benchmark the performance of recent differentiable causal
discovery methods under model assumption violations, and provide the standard
for reasonable evaluation of causal discovery, as well as to further promote
its application in real-world scenarios.

Conclusion: 提出的算法框架能有效处理跨上下文最小奖励约束的多臂老虎机问题，在保证公平分配的同时优化性能，理论分析证明了方法的有效性。

Abstract: We examine a multi-armed bandit problem with contextual information, where
the objective is to ensure that each arm receives a minimum aggregated reward
across contexts while simultaneously maximizing the total cumulative reward.
This framework captures a broad class of real-world applications where fair
revenue allocation is critical and contextual variation is inherent. The
cross-context aggregation of minimum reward constraints, while enabling better
performance and easier feasibility, introduces significant technical challenges
-- particularly the absence of closed-form optimal allocations typically
available in standard MAB settings. We design and analyze algorithms that
either optimistically prioritize performance or pessimistically enforce
constraint satisfaction. For each algorithm, we derive problem-dependent upper
bounds on both regret and constraint violations. Furthermore, we establish a
lower bound demonstrating that the dependence on the time horizon in our
results is optimal in general and revealing fundamental limitations of the free
exploration principle leveraged in prior work.

are analysed with regard to their applicability in the project. The selection
of suitable methods in the edge area is based in particular on criteria such as

Abstract: Cross-silo federated learning (FL) is a promising approach to enable
cross-organization collaboration in machine learning model development without
directly sharing private data. Despite growing organizational interest driven
by data protection regulations such as GDPR and HIPAA, the adoption of
cross-silo FL remains limited in practice. In this paper, we conduct an
interview study to understand the practical challenges associated with
cross-silo FL adoption. With interviews spanning a diverse set of stakeholders
such as user organizations, software providers, and academic researchers, we
uncover various barriers, from concerns about model performance to questions of

TL;DR: 知识蒸馏的功能性影响被量化分析，发现其更像数据依赖的正则化器而非压缩机制，存在负面知识的不对称转移，引发安全担忧。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解知识蒸馏的功能性影响，量化其压缩能力和知识转移机制，分离压缩与架构缩减的影响。

Method: 使用假设检验、对照实验和随机控制蒸馏，分析多种蒸馏变体和模型尺寸的蒸馏缩放规律，涵盖12个实验设置、9种架构和7个数据集。

Result: 在某些模态和架构中存在统计显著的知识转移，但程度低于预期；在显著知识转移情况下，观察到负面知识向学生的严重不对称转移。

Conclusion: 知识蒸馏主要作为数据依赖的正则化器而非压缩机制，具有负面不对称回报，在应用中存在安全隐患。

Abstract: Knowledge distillation is often considered a compression mechanism when
judged on the resulting student's accuracy and loss, yet its functional impact
is poorly understood. In this work, we quantify the compression capacity of
knowledge distillation and the resulting knowledge transfer from a functional
perspective, decoupling compression from architectural reduction, which
provides an improved understanding of knowledge distillation. We employ
hypothesis testing, controls, and random control distillation to understand
knowledge transfer mechanisms across data modalities. To rigorously test the
breadth and limits of our analyses, we explore multiple distillation variants
and analyse distillation scaling laws across model sizes. Our findings
demonstrate that, while there is statistically significant knowledge transfer
in some modalities and architectures, the extent of this transfer is less
pronounced than anticipated, even under conditions designed to maximise
knowledge sharing. Notably, in cases of significant knowledge transfer, we
identify a consistent and severe asymmetric transfer of negative knowledge to
the student, raising safety concerns in knowledge distillation applications.
Across 12 experimental setups, 9 architectures, and 7 datasets, our findings
show that knowledge distillation functions less as a compression mechanism and
more as a data-dependent regulariser with a negative asymmetric payoff.

TL;DR: 提出使用预训练的基础推理模型(FIMs)来解耦高维动力系统中的潜在变量发现和动力学建模问题，通过冻结FIM权重仅训练编码器-解码器映射，实现快速且可重用的粗粒化流程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高维动力系统记录通常具有低维流形上的有效变量，传统方法需要同时解决变量发现和动力学拟合两个耦合问题，这导致训练不稳定。

Method: 利用预训练的FIMs估计动力系统的无穷小生成元，冻结FIM权重，仅训练编码器-解码器映射，定义简单的模拟一致性损失函数。

Conclusion: 该方法通过解耦变量发现和动力学建模，稳定了表示学习，为快速可重用的粗粒化流程提供了新思路。

Abstract: High-dimensional recordings of dynamical processes are often characterized by
a much smaller set of effective variables, evolving on low-dimensional
manifolds. Identifying these latent dynamics requires solving two intertwined
problems: discovering appropriate coarse-grained variables and simultaneously
fitting the governing equations. Most machine learning approaches tackle these
tasks jointly by training autoencoders together with models that enforce
dynamical consistency. We propose to decouple the two problems by leveraging
the recently introduced Foundation Inference Models (FIMs). FIMs are pretrained
models that estimate the infinitesimal generators of dynamical systems (e.g.,
the drift and diffusion of a stochastic differential equation) in zero-shot
mode. By amortizing the inference of the dynamics through a FIM with frozen
weights, and training only the encoder-decoder map, we define a simple,
simulation-consistent loss that stabilizes representation learning. A proof of
concept on a stochastic double-well system with semicircle diffusion, embedded
into synthetic video data, illustrates the potential of this approach for fast
and reusable coarse-graining pipelines.

Motivation: 解决传统AFA方法局限于单一预定任务的问题，提高在特征系统缺失和标签有限情况下的可扩展性

Method: 使用序列建模或自回归预训练进行可靠的不确定性量化，结合不确定性引导的贪婪特征获取代理最大化条件互信息

Result: 在合成和真实表格基准测试中，L2M匹配或超越任务特定基线，特别是在标签稀缺和缺失率高的情况下

Conclusion: L2M能够直接在具有回顾性缺失的数据集上操作，在上下文中执行元AFA任务，无需每个任务重新训练

Abstract: Active feature acquisition (AFA) is a sequential decision-making problem
where the goal is to improve model performance for test instances by adaptively
selecting which features to acquire. In practice, AFA methods often learn from
retrospective data with systematic missingness in the features and limited
task-specific labels. Most prior work addresses acquisition for a single
predetermined task, limiting scalability. To address this limitation, we
formalize the meta-AFA problem, where the goal is to learn acquisition policies
across various tasks. We introduce Learning-to-Measure (L2M), which consists of
i) reliable uncertainty quantification over unseen tasks, and ii) an
uncertainty-guided greedy feature acquisition agent that maximizes conditional
mutual information. We demonstrate a sequence-modeling or autoregressive
pre-training approach that underpins reliable uncertainty quantification for
tasks with arbitrary missingness. L2M operates directly on datasets with
retrospective missingness and performs the meta-AFA task in-context,
eliminating per-task retraining. Across synthetic and real-world tabular
benchmarks, L2M matches or surpasses task-specific baselines, particularly
under scarce labels and high missingness.

TL;DR: 本文提出了贝尔曼-瓦瑟斯坦距离（BWD），一种无需训练智能体即可评估离线强化学习数据集质量的方法。BWD通过行为评论家和状态条件最优传输来衡量数据集行为策略与随机参考策略的差异，能够有效预测离线RL算法的性能表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 离线强化学习依赖于静态数据集，但现实中数据集质量差异很大，包含专家、次优甚至随机轨迹。由于数据来源和技能组成未知，难以预先评估数据集质量，这影响了算法选择。

Method: 提出了贝尔曼-瓦瑟斯坦距离（BWD），这是一种基于价值感知的最优传输评分方法。通过行为评论家和状态条件最优传输公式计算，无需环境交互或完整策略优化。

Result: 在D4RL MuJoCo任务上的实验表明，BWD与多个离线RL算法的oracle性能得分强相关，能有效预测标准智能体在给定数据集上的表现。将BWD作为正则化器还能在策略优化中提升回报。

Conclusion: BWD等基于价值感知的分布信号是评估离线RL数据集质量和优化策略的实用工具，能够有效指导算法选择和策略改进。

Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (RL) learns exclusively from static datasets,
without further interaction with the environment. In practice, such datasets
vary widely in quality, often mixing expert, suboptimal, and even random
trajectories. The choice of algorithm therefore depends on dataset fidelity.
Behavior cloning can suffice on high-quality data, whereas mixed- or
low-quality data typically benefits from offline RL methods that stitch useful
behavior across trajectories. Yet in the wild it is difficult to assess dataset
quality a priori because the data's provenance and skill composition are
unknown. We address the problem of estimating offline dataset quality without
training an agent. We study a spectrum of proxies from simple cumulative
rewards to learned value based estimators, and introduce the Bellman
Wasserstein distance (BWD), a value aware optimal transport score that measures
how dissimilar a dataset's behavioral policy is from a random reference policy.
BWD is computed from a behavioral critic and a state conditional OT
formulation, requiring no environment interaction or full policy optimization.
Across D4RL MuJoCo tasks, BWD strongly correlates with an oracle performance
score that aggregates multiple offline RL algorithms, enabling efficient
prediction of how well standard agents will perform on a given dataset. Beyond
prediction, integrating BWD as a regularizer during policy optimization
explicitly pushes the learned policy away from random behavior and improves
returns. These results indicate that value aware, distributional signals such
as BWD are practical tools for triaging offline RL datasets and policy
optimization.

Abstract: Many scientific fields, from medicine to seismology, rely on analyzing
sequences of events over time to understand complex systems. Traditionally,
machine learning models must be built and trained from scratch for each new
dataset, which is a slow and costly process. We introduce a new approach: a
single, powerful model that learns the underlying patterns of event data in
context. We trained this "foundation model" on millions of simulated event
sequences, teaching it a general-purpose understanding of how events can
unfold. As a result, our model can analyze new scientific data instantly,
without retraining, simply by looking at a few examples from the dataset. It
can also be quickly fine-tuned for even higher accuracy. This approach makes
sophisticated event analysis more accessible and accelerates the pace of
scientific discovery.

Abstract: Ordinary differential equations (ODEs) describe dynamical systems evolving
deterministically in continuous time. Accurate data-driven modeling of systems
as ODEs, a central problem across the natural sciences, remains challenging,
especially if the data is sparse or noisy. We introduce FIM-ODE (Foundation
Inference Model for ODEs), a pretrained neural model designed to estimate ODEs
zero-shot (i.e., in context) from sparse and noisy observations. Trained on
synthetic data, the model utilizes a flexible neural operator for robust ODE
inference, even from corrupted data. We empirically verify that FIM-ODE
provides accurate estimates, on par with a neural state-of-the-art method, and
qualitatively compare the structure of their estimated vector fields.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SG-XDEAT是一个用于表格数据监督学习的新框架，通过双流编码器将特征分解为原始值和目标感知两个并行表示，结合跨维度、跨编码自注意力和自适应稀疏机制来提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的表格数据深度学习方法在处理特征间的复杂依赖关系和对噪声的鲁棒性方面存在不足，需要一种能够同时建模原始特征和目标感知特征、并能自适应过滤噪声的框架。

Method: 采用双流编码器将每个输入特征分解为原始值流和目标感知流，通过跨维度自注意力捕获流内特征依赖，跨编码自注意力实现双流交互，自适应稀疏自注意力机制动态抑制低效用标记。

Result: 在多个公开基准测试中，SG-XDEAT相比强基线模型取得了持续的性能提升，验证了联合建模原始视图和目标感知视图并自适应过滤噪声的有效性。

Conclusion: SG-XDEAT通过联合建模原始特征和目标感知特征，并采用自适应稀疏机制过滤噪声，构建了一个更鲁棒的深度表格学习器，在表格数据监督学习中表现出优越性能。

Abstract: We propose SG-XDEAT (Sparsity-Guided Cross Dimensional and Cross-Encoding
Attention with Target Aware Conditioning), a novel framework designed for
supervised learning on tabular data. At its core, SG-XDEAT employs a
dual-stream encoder that decomposes each input feature into two parallel
representations: a raw value stream and a target-conditioned (label-aware)
stream. These dual representations are then propagated through a hierarchical
stack of attention-based modules. SG-XDEAT integrates three key components: (i)
Cross-Dimensional self-attention, which captures intra-view dependencies among
features within each stream; (ii) Cross-Encoding self-attention, which enables
bidirectional interaction between raw and target-aware representations; and
(iii) an Adaptive Sparse Self-Attention (ASSA) mechanism, which dynamically
suppresses low-utility tokens by driving their attention weights toward
zero--thereby mitigating the impact of noise. Empirical results on multiple
public benchmarks show consistent gains over strong baselines, confirming that
jointly modeling raw and target-aware views--while adaptively filtering
noise--yields a more robust deep tabular learner.

Abstract: Whisper models have achieved remarkable progress in speech recognition; yet
their large size remains a bottleneck for deployment on resource-constrained
edge devices. This paper proposes a framework to design fine-tuned variants of

the Sparse Group LASSO penalty as a loss regularizer, to reduce the number of
FLOating Point operations (FLOPs). Further, a weight statistics aware pruning
algorithm is proposed. We also design our custom text normalizer for WER
evaluation. On Common Voice 11.0 Hindi dataset, we obtain, without degrading
WER, (a) 35.4% reduction in model parameters, 14.25% lower memory consumption
and 18.5% fewer FLOPs on Whisper-small, and (b) 31% reduction in model
parameters, 15.29% lower memory consumption and 16.95% fewer FLOPs on

Abstract: Spectral clustering is a fundamental method for graph partitioning, but its
reliance on eigenvector computation limits scalability to massive graphs.
Classical sparsification methods preserve spectral properties by sampling edges
proportionally to their effective resistances, but require expensive
preprocessing to estimate these resistances. We study whether uniform edge
sampling-a simple, structure-agnostic strategy-can suffice for spectral
clustering. Our main result shows that for graphs admitting a well-separated
$k$-clustering, characterized by a large structure ratio $\Upsilon(k) =
\lambda_{k+1} / \rho_G(k)$, uniform sampling preserves the spectral subspace
used for clustering. Specifically, we prove that uniformly sampling $O(\gamma^2
n \log n / \epsilon^2)$ edges, where $\gamma$ is the Laplacian condition
number, yields a sparsifier whose top $(n-k)$-dimensional eigenspace is
approximately orthogonal to the cluster indicators. This ensures that the
spectral embedding remains faithful, and clustering quality is preserved. Our
analysis introduces new resistance bounds for intra-cluster edges, a
rank-$(n-k)$ effective resistance formulation, and a matrix Chernoff bound
adapted to the dominant eigenspace. These tools allow us to bypass importance
sampling entirely. Conceptually, our result connects recent coreset-based
clustering theory to spectral sparsification, showing that under strong
clusterability, even uniform sampling is structure-aware. This provides the
first provable guarantee that uniform edge sampling suffices for
structure-preserving spectral clustering.

Abstract: Large Language Models are susceptible to jailbreak attacks that bypass

lightweight approach to AI safety with no additional training data or model
fine-tuning, while incurring only a small computational overhead at inference.

Abstract: Hybrid thinking enables LLMs to switch between reasoning and direct
answering, offering a balance between efficiency and reasoning capability. Yet
our experiments reveal that current hybrid thinking LLMs only achieve partial
mode separation: reasoning behaviors often leak into the no-think mode. To
understand and mitigate this, we analyze the factors influencing
controllability and identify four that matter most: (1) larger data scale, (2)
using think and no-think answers from different questions rather than the same
question, (3) a moderate increase in no-think data number, and (4) a two-phase
strategy that first trains reasoning ability and then applies hybrid think
training. Building on these findings, we propose a practical recipe that,
compared to standard training, can maintain accuracy in both modes while
significantly reducing no-think output length (from $1085$ to $585$ on MATH500)
and occurrences of reasoning-supportive tokens such as ``\texttt{wait}'' (from
$5917$ to $522$ on MATH500). Our findings highlight the limitations of current
hybrid thinking and offer directions for strengthening its controllability.

Abstract: Time Series Foundation Models (TSFMs) have shown significant impact through
their model capacity, scalability, and zero-shot generalization. However, due
to the heterogeneity of inter-variate dependencies and the backbone scalability
on large-scale multivariate datasets, most TSFMs are typically pre-trained on
univariate time series. This limitation renders them oblivious to crucial
information from diverse covariates in real-world forecasting tasks. To further
enhance the performance of TSFMs, we propose a general covariate-aware
adaptation (CoRA) framework for TSFMs. It leverages pre-trained backbones of
foundation models while effectively incorporating exogenous covariates from
various modalities, including time series, language, and images, to improve the
quality of predictions. Technically, CoRA maintains the equivalence of
initialization and parameter consistency during adaptation. With preserved
backbones of foundation models as frozen feature extractors, the outcome
embeddings from foundation models are empirically demonstrated more informative
than raw data. Further, CoRA employs a novel Granger Causality Embedding (GCE)
to automatically evaluate covariates regarding their causal predictability with
respect to the target variate. We incorporate these weighted embeddings with a
zero-initialized condition-injection mechanism, avoiding catastrophic
forgetting of pre-trained foundation models and gradually integrates exogenous
information. Extensive experiments show that CoRA of TSFMs surpasses
state-of-the-art covariate-aware deep forecasters with full or few-shot
training samples, achieving 31.1% MSE reduction on covariate-aware forecasting.
Compared to other adaptation methods, CoRA exhibits strong compatibility with
various advanced TSFMs and extends the scope of covariates to other modalities,
presenting a practical paradigm for the application of TSFMs.

Abstract: Abnormal stop detection (ASD) in intercity coach transportation is critical
for ensuring passenger safety, operational reliability, and regulatory
compliance. However, two key challenges hinder ASD effectiveness: sparse GPS
trajectories, which obscure short or unauthorized stops, and limited labeled
data, which restricts supervised learning. Existing methods often assume dense
sampling or regular movement patterns, limiting their applicability. To address
data sparsity, we propose a Sparsity-Aware Segmentation (SAS) method that
adaptively defines segment boundaries based on local spatial-temporal density.
Building upon these segments, we introduce three domain-specific indicators to
capture abnormal stop behaviors. To further mitigate the impact of sparsity, we
develop Locally Temporal-Indicator Guided Adjustment (LTIGA), which smooths
these indicators via local similarity graphs. To overcome label scarcity, we
construct a spatial-temporal graph where each segment is a node with
LTIGA-refined features. We apply label propagation to expand weak supervision
across the graph, followed by a GCN to learn relational patterns. A final
self-training module incorporates high-confidence pseudo-labels to iteratively
improve predictions. Experiments on real-world coach data show an AUC of 0.854
and AP of 0.866 using only 10 labeled instances, outperforming prior methods.

Abstract: Diffusion models have emerged as powerful generative priors for
high-dimensional inverse problems, yet learning them when only corrupted or
noisy observations are available remains challenging. In this work, we propose
a new method for training diffusion models with Expectation-Maximization (EM)
from corrupted data. Our proposed method, DiffEM, utilizes conditional
diffusion models to reconstruct clean data from observations in the E-step, and
then uses the reconstructed data to refine the conditional diffusion model in
the M-step. Theoretically, we provide monotonic convergence guarantees for the
DiffEM iteration, assuming appropriate statistical conditions. We demonstrate
the effectiveness of our approach through experiments on various image
reconstruction tasks.

Abstract: This paper explores the topological signatures of ReLU neural network
activation patterns. We consider feedforward neural networks with ReLU
activation functions and analyze the polytope decomposition of the feature
space induced by the network. Mainly, we investigate how the Fiedler partition
of the dual graph and show that it appears to correlate with the decision
boundary -- in the case of binary classification. Additionally, we compute the
homology of the cellular decomposition -- in a regression task -- to draw
similar patterns in behavior between the training loss and polyhedral
cell-count, as the model is trained.

Abstract: Chemical pretrained models, sometimes referred to as foundation models, are
receiving considerable interest for drug discovery applications. The general
chemical knowledge extracted from self-supervised training has the potential to
improve predictions for critical drug discovery endpoints, including on-target
potency and ADMET properties. Multi-task learning has previously been
successfully leveraged to improve predictive models. Here, we show that
enabling multitasking in finetuning of chemical pretrained graph neural network
models such as Kinetic GROVER Multi-Task (KERMT), an enhanced version of the
GROVER model, and Knowledge-guided Pre-training of Graph Transformer (KGPT)
significantly improves performance over non-pretrained graph neural network
models. Surprisingly, we find that the performance improvement from finetuning
KERMT in a multitask manner is most significant at larger data sizes.
Additionally, we publish two multitask ADMET data splits to enable more
accurate benchmarking of multitask deep learning methods for drug property
prediction. Finally, we provide an accelerated implementation of the KERMT
model on GitHub, unlocking large-scale pretraining, finetuning, and inference
in industrial drug discovery workflows.

TL;DR: CARVQ是一种结合校正适配器和分组残差矢量量化的后训练压缩方法，可将LLM嵌入层压缩至约1.6比特，显著减少存储需求和内存占用，适用于边缘设备部署。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型的嵌入层参数庞大，导致存储需求高和内存占用大，特别是在边缘设备上成为内存瓶颈。压缩嵌入层可释放内存带宽并加速推理。

Method: 提出CARVQ方法，结合线性非线性映射的校正适配器和分组残差矢量量化，无需专用硬件支持低比特存储，兼容现有transformer量化方法。

Result: 在多个LLM模型和任务上测试，CARVQ在保持合理困惑度和准确率的同时，相比标量量化实现了更低的平均比特宽度，可无缝集成到支持4位内存的硬件中。

Conclusion: 这项工作展示了在边缘设备上高效部署LLMs的关键一步，CARVQ压缩技术能显著减少模型在内存受限设备上的内存占用。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) typically rely on a large number of parameters
for token embedding, leading to substantial storage requirements and memory
footprints. In particular, LLMs deployed on edge devices are memory-bound, and
reducing the memory footprint by compressing the embedding layer not only frees
up the memory bandwidth but also speeds up inference. To address this, we
introduce CARVQ, a post-training novel Corrective Adaptor combined with group
Residual Vector Quantization. CARVQ relies on the composition of both linear
and non-linear maps and mimics the original model embedding to compress to
approximately 1.6 bits without requiring specialized hardware to support
lower-bit storage. We test our method on pre-trained LLMs such as LLaMA-3.2-1B,
LLaMA-3.2-3B, LLaMA-3.2-3B-Instruct, LLaMA-3.1-8B, Qwen2.5-7B, Qwen2.5-Math-7B
and Phi-4, evaluating on common generative, discriminative, math and reasoning
tasks. We show that in most cases, CARVQ can achieve lower average
bitwidth-per-parameter while maintaining reasonable perplexity and accuracy
compared to scalar quantization. Our contributions include a novel compression
technique that is compatible with state-of-the-art transformer quantization
methods and can be seamlessly integrated into any hardware supporting 4-bit
memory to reduce the model's memory footprint in memory-constrained devices.
This work demonstrates a crucial step toward the efficient deployment of LLMs
on edge devices.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文研究了决策树学习中通过固定次数的局部搜索操作（调整切割阈值或交换特征）来最小化分类错误的问题，发现这些问题通常是NP完全的，但通过参数化复杂度分析找到了使问题可解的特定条件。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 决策树学习算法通常包含启发式局部搜索操作，但缺乏对这些操作的理论复杂度分析。本文旨在系统分析这些操作的参数化复杂度，确定问题的难解性和可解性条件。

Method: 采用参数化复杂度理论进行分析，考虑了特征数量d和域大小D等参数。提出了一个时间复杂度为$(D + 1)^{2d} \cdot |I|^{O(1)}$的算法，并进行了概念验证实现和实证评估。

Result: 发现当特征数量d和域大小D都很小时，问题具有固定参数可解性。当只考虑其中一个参数时，问题仍然是NP难的。提出的算法在理论分析和实验中都表现良好。

Conclusion: 决策树局部搜索操作的最小化分类错误问题在一般情况下是NP完全的，但在特征数量和域大小都很小的组合条件下具有固定参数可解性，这为实际应用提供了理论指导。

Abstract: Algorithms for learning decision trees often include heuristic local-search
operations such as (1) adjusting the threshold of a cut or (2) also exchanging
the feature of that cut. We study minimizing the number of classification
errors by performing a fixed number of a single type of these operations.
Although we discover that the corresponding problems are NP-complete in
general, we provide a comprehensive parameterized-complexity analysis with the
aim of determining those properties of the problems that explain the hardness
and those that make the problems tractable. For instance, we show that the
problems remain hard for a small number $d$ of features or small domain size
$D$ but the combination of both yields fixed-parameter tractability. That is,
the problems are solvable in $(D + 1)^{2d} \cdot |I|^{O(1)}$ time, where $|I|$
is the size of the input. We also provide a proof-of-concept implementation of
this algorithm and report on empirical results.

TL;DR: UNIVERSE方法通过Rashomon集合处理变量重要性分析中的未观测变量问题，为真实变量重要性提供边界估计


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统变量重要性分析依赖单一模型和观测特征，但实际中重要变量常被遗漏，且不同模型会给出不同的变量重要性（Rashomon效应）

Method: 使用Rashomon集合（数据集中接近最优的模型集合），即使存在缺失特征也能为真实变量重要性提供边界

Result: 理论证明方法稳健性，在半合成模拟中表现良好，在信用风险任务中展示实用性

Conclusion: UNIVERSE方法能有效处理变量重要性分析中的未观测变量问题，提供更可靠的变量重要性边界估计

Abstract: Variable importance (VI) methods are often used for hypothesis generation,
feature selection, and scientific validation. In the standard VI pipeline, an
analyst estimates VI for a single predictive model with only the observed
features. However, the importance of a feature depends heavily on which other
variables are included in the model, and essential variables are often omitted
from observational datasets. Moreover, the VI estimated for one model is often
not the same as the VI estimated for another equally-good model - a phenomenon
known as the Rashomon Effect. We address these gaps by introducing
UNobservables and Inference for Variable importancE using Rashomon SEts
(UNIVERSE). Our approach adapts Rashomon sets - the sets of near-optimal models
in a dataset - to produce bounds on the true VI even with missing features. We
theoretically guarantee the robustness of our approach, show strong performance
on semi-synthetic simulations, and demonstrate its utility in a credit risk
task.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: KoALA是一种无需语义信息、无需架构修改或对抗训练的新型对抗性检测器，通过KL散度和L0相似度两种互补指标的类别预测不一致来检测对抗攻击。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度神经网络对对抗性攻击高度敏感，这对安全和关键应用构成重大风险，需要开发轻量级、即插即用的检测解决方案。

Method: 使用KL散度（对密集低幅扰动敏感）和L0相似度（对稀疏高影响变化敏感）两种互补指标，当它们的类别预测不一致时检测对抗攻击。仅需在预训练图像编码器上使用干净图像进行简单微调。

Result: 在ResNet/CIFAR-10上达到0.94精度和0.81召回率，在CLIP/Tiny-ImageNet上达到0.66精度和0.85召回率。当定理条件满足时能一致有效地检测对抗样本。

Conclusion: KoALA是一种轻量级、即插即用的对抗性检测解决方案，适用于现有模型和多种数据模态，无需架构修改或对抗训练。

Abstract: Deep neural networks are highly susceptible to adversarial attacks, which
pose significant risks to security- and safety-critical applications. We
present KoALA (KL-L0 Adversarial detection via Label Agreement), a novel,
semantics-free adversarial detector that requires no architectural changes or
adversarial retraining. KoALA operates on a simple principle: it detects an
adversarial attack when class predictions from two complementary similarity
metrics disagree. These metrics-KL divergence and an L0-based similarity-are
specifically chosen to detect different types of perturbations. The KL
divergence metric is sensitive to dense, low-amplitude shifts, while the
L0-based similarity is designed for sparse, high-impact changes. We provide a
formal proof of correctness for our approach. The only training required is a
simple fine-tuning step on a pre-trained image encoder using clean images to
ensure the embeddings align well with both metrics. This makes KOALA a
lightweight, plug-and-play solution for existing models and various data
modalities. Our extensive experiments on ResNet/CIFAR-10 and CLIP/Tiny-ImageNet
confirm our theoretical claims. When the theorem's conditions are met, KoALA
consistently and effectively detects adversarial examples. On the full test
sets, KoALA achieves a precision of 0.94 and a recall of 0.81 on
ResNet/CIFAR-10, and a precision of 0.66 and a recall of 0.85 on
CLIP/Tiny-ImageNet.

TL;DR: 本文研究如何构建概率预测器，使其在下游用户决策时能产生准确决策。针对多决策者场景，提出了比现有方法更高效的算法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在构建适用于多决策者的预测器时存在不足：基于多校准的方法样本复杂度不优，基于对抗游戏的方法会产生复杂随机化预测器。需要设计更直接高效的算法。

Method: 提出了一种非随机化算法，利用适当损失函数集的结构特性，通过更直接的方式实现全预测，避免了现有方法的复杂度问题。

Result: 证明了多校准比全预测是更困难的问题，因此基于多校准的方法必然存在次优样本复杂度。新算法在样本效率上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 通过利用适当损失函数的结构特性，设计出了更直接、非随机化的全预测算法，解决了现有方法的复杂度和效率问题。

Abstract: We consider the problem of constructing probabilistic predictions that lead
to accurate decisions when employed by downstream users to inform actions. For
a single decision maker, designing an optimal predictor is equivalent to
minimizing a proper loss function corresponding to the negative utility of that
individual. For multiple decision makers, our problem can be viewed as a
variant of omniprediction in which the goal is to design a single predictor
that simultaneously minimizes multiple losses. Existing algorithms for
achieving omniprediction broadly fall into two categories: 1) boosting methods
that optimize other auxiliary targets such as multicalibration and obtain
omniprediction as a corollary, and 2) adversarial two-player game based
approaches that estimate and respond to the ``worst-case" loss in an online
fashion. We give lower bounds demonstrating that multicalibration is a strictly
more difficult problem than omniprediction and thus the former approach must
incur suboptimal sample complexity. For the latter approach, we discuss how
these ideas can be used to obtain a sample-efficient algorithm through an
online-to-batch conversion. This conversion has the downside of returning a
complex, randomized predictor. We improve on this method by designing a more
direct, unrandomized algorithm that exploits structural elements of the set of
proper losses.

Main category: cs.AR

TL;DR: 提出了一种优化的基于描述符的DMA控制器，专门针对小单元尺寸的任意传输进行高效处理，通过轻量级描述符格式和推测性预取方案显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着计算系统异构性增加和机器学习应用需求增长，传统基于描述符的DMA控制器在处理小单元尺寸的任意传输时效率低下，存在描述符过大和处理串行化导致的静态开销问题。

Method: 实现轻量级描述符格式的AXI4 DMA控制器，采用低开销推测性描述符预取方案，集成到64位Linux兼容的RISC-V SoC中，并在Kintex FPGA上进行仿真评估。

Result: 相比商用DMA IP，传输启动延迟减少1.66倍，64字节传输时总线利用率提升2.5倍，资源使用减少11%查找表、23%触发器，无需块RAM；在深度内存系统中总线利用率优势扩大到3.6倍。

Conclusion: 所提出的优化DMA控制器在GF12LP+工艺下达到1.44 GHz时钟频率，仅占用49.5 kGE面积，显著提升了小尺寸数据传输效率。

Abstract: With the ever-growing heterogeneity in computing systems, driven by modern
machine learning applications, pressure is increasing on memory systems to
handle arbitrary and more demanding transfers efficiently. Descriptor-based
direct memory access controllers (DMACs) allow such transfers to be executed by
decoupling memory transfers from processing units. Classical descriptor-based
DMACs are inefficient when handling arbitrary transfers of small unit sizes.
Excessive descriptor size and the serialized nature of processing descriptors
employed by the DMAC lead to large static overheads when setting up transfers.
To tackle this inefficiency, we propose a descriptor-based DMAC optimized to
efficiently handle arbitrary transfers of small unit sizes. We implement a
lightweight descriptor format in an AXI4-based DMAC. We further increase
performance by implementing a low-overhead speculative descriptor prefetching
scheme without additional latency penalties in the case of a misprediction. Our
DMAC is integrated into a 64-bit Linux-capable RISC-V SoC and emulated on a
Kintex FPGA to evaluate its performance. Compared to an off-the-shelf
descriptor-based DMAC IP, we achieve 1.66x less latency launching transfers,
increase bus utilization up to 2.5x in an ideal memory system with
64-byte-length transfers while requiring 11% fewer lookup tables, 23% fewer
flip-flops, and no block RAMs. We can extend our lead in bus utilization to
3.6x with 64-byte-length transfers in deep memory systems. We synthesized our
DMAC in GlobalFoundries' GF12LP+ node, achieving a clock frequency of over 1.44
GHz while occupying only 49.5 kGE.

TL;DR: 该论文研究将KV存储的内存数据结构从昂贵的DRAM卸载到微秒级延迟的二级内存，通过软件预取技术隐藏内存延迟，发现IO操作的存在显著增强了系统对内存延迟的容忍度，使得SSD-based KV存储可以在微秒级延迟内存上实现接近DRAM的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了降低KV存储系统的成本，考虑将大部分内存数据结构从昂贵的DRAM转移到成本更低但延迟较高的微秒级延迟内存，但需要解决长内存延迟对性能的影响。

Method: 分析软件预取技术与IO操作的交互对性能的影响，建立性能模型，设计微基准测试并修改现有SSD-based KV存储以支持用户级线程预取，在可调微秒延迟的FPGA内存上进行实验验证。

Result: 实验结果表明，修改后的KV存储在内存延迟高达5微秒时仍能实现接近DRAM的吞吐量，验证了性能模型的准确性。

Conclusion: SSD-based KV存储可以利用微秒级延迟内存作为DRAM的经济有效替代方案，无需为微秒级延迟内存设计新技术，因为IO操作的存在显著增强了系统对内存延迟的容忍能力。

Abstract: When key-value (KV) stores use SSDs for storing a large number of items,
oftentimes they also require large in-memory data structures including indices
and caches to be traversed to reduce IOs. This paper considers offloading most
of such data structures from the costly host DRAM to secondary memory whose
latency is in the microsecond range, an order of magnitude longer than those of
currently available DIMM-mounted or CXL memory devices. While emerging
microsecond-latency memory is likely to cost much less than DRAM, it can
significantly slow down SSD-based KV stores if naively employed. This paper
analyzes and evaluates the impact of microsecond-level memory latency on the KV
operation throughput. Our analysis finds that a well-known latency-hiding
technique of software prefetching for long-latency memory from user-level
threads is effective. The novelty of our analysis lies in modeling how the
interplay between prefetching and IO affects performance, from which we derive
an equation that well explains the throughput degradation due to long memory
latency. The model tells us that the presence of IO significantly enhances the
tolerance to memory latency, leading to a finding that SSD-based KV stores can
be made latency-tolerant without devising new techniques for
microsecond-latency memory. To confirm this, we design a microbenchmark as well
as modify existing SSD-based KV stores so that they issue prefetches from
user-level threads, and run them while placing most of in-memory data
structures on FPGA-based memory with adjustable microsecond latency. The
results demonstrate that their KV operation throughputs can be well explained
by our model, and the modified KV stores achieve near-DRAM throughputs for up
to a memory latency of 5 microseconds. This suggests the possibility that
SSD-based KV stores can use microsecond-latency memory as a cost-effective
alternative to the host DRAM.

Motivation: 当前LLM服务系统采用静态管道配置，无法适应动态工作负载变化，导致资源效率低下和GPU碎片化问题严重。

Method: 将模型分解为细粒度阶段，基于实时请求模式分析动态调整管道粒度，包括：细粒度模型分区、运行时管道重构和拓扑感知资源分配。

Result: 在82-GPU集群上评估显示，资源效率提升8.5倍，延迟降低38.3%，GPU预留需求从峰值容量的75%降至30%。

Conclusion: FlexPipe通过动态管道重构有效解决了LLM服务中的资源效率问题，显著提升了系统性能。

Abstract: Serving Large Language Models (LLMs) in production faces significant
challenges from highly variable request patterns and severe resource
fragmentation in serverless clusters. Current systems rely on static pipeline
configurations that struggle to adapt to dynamic workload conditions, leading
to substantial inefficiencies. We present FlexPipe, a novel system that
dynamically reconfigures pipeline architectures during runtime to address these
fundamental limitations. FlexPipe decomposes models into fine-grained stages
and intelligently adjusts pipeline granularity based on real-time request
pattern analysis, implementing three key innovations: fine-grained model
partitioning with preserved computational graph constraints, inflight pipeline
refactoring with consistent cache transitions, and topology-aware resource
allocation that navigates GPU fragmentation. Comprehensive evaluation on an
82-GPU cluster demonstrates that FlexPipe achieves up to 8.5x better resource
efficiency while maintaining 38.3% lower latency compared to state-of-the-art
systems, reducing GPU reservation requirements from 75% to 30% of peak
capacity.

Conclusion: TALP-Pages为HPC代码开发提供了轻量级、高效的性能监控解决方案，易于集成并能有效检测性能变化。

Abstract: Ensuring good performance is a key aspect in the development of codes that
target HPC machines. As these codes are under active development, the necessity
to detect performance degradation early in the development process becomes
apparent. In addition, having meaningful insight into application scaling
behavior tightly coupled to the development workflow is helpful. In this paper,
we introduce TALP-Pages, an easy-to-integrate framework that enables developers
to get fast and in-repository feedback about their code performance using
established fundamental performance and scaling factors. The framework relies
on TALP, which enables the on-the-fly collection of these metrics. Based on a
folder structure suited for CI which contains the files generated by TALP,
TALP-Pages generates an HTML report with visualizations of the performance
factor regression as well as scaling-efficiency tables. We compare TALP-Pages
to tracing-based tools in terms of overhead and post-processing requirements
and find that TALP-Pages can produce the scaling-efficiency tables faster and
under tighter resource constraints. To showcase the ease of use and
effectiveness of this approach, we extend the current CI setup of GENE-X with
only minimal changes required and showcase the ability to detect and explain a
performance improvement.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 受GPU图像分割器近期成功的启发，开发GPU加速的进程映射算法以显著提升性能。

Method: 第一种算法采用分层多分割方法，沿超级计算机层次结构划分任务图；第二种算法将进程映射直接集成到现代多级图分割流程中，利用GPU并行性加速关键阶段。

Result: 两种方法相比最先进的CPU算法实现了超过300倍的加速。第一种算法通信成本平均高出10%，但仍有竞争力；第二种算法速度更快（几何平均加速77.6倍，峰值598倍），但解质量较低。

Conclusion: 这是首个基于GPU的进程映射算法，在保持可接受解质量的同时实现了显著的性能提升。

Abstract: Process mapping asks to assign vertices of a task graph to processing
elements of a supercomputer such that the computational workload is balanced
while the communication cost is minimized. Motivated by the recent success of
GPU-based graph partitioners, we propose two GPU-accelerated algorithms for
this optimization problem. The first algorithm employs hierarchical
multisection, which partitions the task graph alongside the hierarchy of the
supercomputer. The method utilizes GPU-based graph partitioners to accelerate
the mapping process. The second algorithm integrates process mapping directly
into the modern multilevel graph partitioning pipeline. Vital phases like
coarsening and refinement are accelerated by exploiting the parallelism of
GPUs. In our experiments, both methods achieve speedups exceeding 300 when
compared to state-of-the-art CPU-based algorithms. The first algorithm has, on
average, about 10 percent greater communication costs and thus remains
competitive to CPU algorithms. The second approach is much faster, with a
geometric mean speedup of 77.6 and peak speedup of 598 at the cost of lower
solution quality. To our knowledge, these are the first GPU-based algorithms
for process mapping.

Metronome employs a time-division multiplexing approach that leverages job
traffic characteristics to construct an elastic network resource allocation
model, enabling efficient bandwidth sharing across multiple jobs. In addition,
it incorporates a multi-objective optimization strategy, jointly considering
latency and job priorities to achieve globally optimal as well as dynamic
resource allocation. Finally, Metronome adapts to the dynamic environment by
monitoring the cluster and performing reconfiguration operations. Extensive
experiments with 13 common machine learning models demonstrate that Metronome
can enhance cluster resource utilization while guaranteeing service
performance. Compared with the existing Kubernetes scheduling mechanisms across
multiple scenarios, Metronome reduces job completion time by up to 19.50% while
improving average bandwidth utilization by up to 23.20%.

Abstract: As data mesh architectures gain traction in federated environments,
organizations are increasingly building consumer-specific data-sharing
pipelines using modular, cloud-native transformation services. Prior work has
shown that structuring these pipelines with reusable transformation stages
enhances both scalability and energy efficiency. However, integrating
traditional cloud design patterns into such pipelines poses a challenge:
predefining and embedding patterns can compromise modularity, reduce
reusability, and conflict with the pipelines dynamic, consumer-driven nature.
To address this, we introduce a Kubernetes-based tool that enables the deferred
and non-intrusive application of selected cloud design patterns without
requiring changes to service source code. The tool supports automated pattern
injection and collects energy consumption metrics, allowing developers to make
energy-aware decisions while preserving the flexible, composable structure of
reusable data-sharing pipelines.

Abstract: Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility (JLab) has partnered with
Energy Sciences Network (ESnet) to define and implement an edge to compute
cluster computational load balancing acceleration architecture. The ESnet-JLab
FPGA Accelerated Transport (EJFAT) architecture focuses on FPGA acceleration to
address compression, fragmentation, UDP packet destination redirection (Network
Address Translation (NAT)) and decompression and reassembly.
  EJFAT seamlessly integrates edge and cluster computing to support direct
processing of streamed experimental data. This will directly benefit the JLab
science program as well as data centers of the future that require high
throughput and low latency for both time-critical data acquisition systems and
data center workflows.
  The EJFAT project will be presented along with how it is synergistic with
other DOE activities such as an Integrated Research Infrastructure (IRI), and

TL;DR: 本文提出了首个GPU算法，用于将带状矩阵约简为双对角形式，作为SVD的关键步骤。该算法通过优化GPU吞吐量，在多种GPU硬件上实现了比CPU实现快100倍以上的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 带状矩阵到双对角形式的约简是SVD计算的关键步骤，之前被认为不适合GPU计算，因为它是内存带宽受限的。但现代GPU硬件的发展（如更大的L1内存）改变了这一状况。

Method: 基于CPU多核并行缓存高效的凸起追逐算法，适配优化GPU吞吐量。使用Julia语言的数组抽象和KernelAbstractions，实现跨NVIDIA、AMD、Intel和Apple Metal GPU的硬件和数据精度无关函数。

Result: GPU算法从1024x1024矩阵大小开始就优于多线程CPU高性能库PLASMA和SLATE，对于32k x 32k矩阵，性能提升超过100倍。算法性能随矩阵带宽大小线性增长。

Conclusion: 这项工作突破了内存带宽和矩阵带宽的障碍，在GPU上实现了数量级更快的带状矩阵到双对角形式的约简算法。

Abstract: The reduction of a banded matrix to a bidiagonal form is a crucial step in
the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), a cornerstone of scientific computing
and AI. Despite being a highly parallel algorithm, it was previously believed
to be unsuitable for GPU computation because it is memory bandwidth-bound.
Recent developments in GPU hardware, including larger L1 memory per Streaming
Multiprocessor/Compute Unit, have changed that. We present the first GPU
algorithm for reducing a banded matrix to bidiagonal form as part of the
NextLA.jl open-source software package. Our algorithm is based on previous
CPU-based multicore parallel cache-efficient bulge chasing algorithms and
adapted to optimize for GPU throughput. We leverage Julia Language's Array
abstractions and KernelAbstractions to implement a single hardware- and data
precision-agnostic function on NVIDIA, AMD, Intel, and Apple Metal GPUs for
half, single, and double precision, and examine performance optimization across
hardware architectures and data precision. We also develop a hardware-aware
performance model and identify key hyperparameters, such as inner tilewidth and
block concurrency, that govern optimal GPU execution for bandwidth-bound
workloads. We demonstrate highly parallel bandwidth-bound algorithm on the GPU
can outperform CPU-based implementations: the GPU algorithm outperforms
multithreaded CPU High-Performance libraries PLASMA and SLATE as of matrix size
1024 x 1024 and by a factor over 100 for matrices of 32k x 32k. In addition,
the performance of the algorithm increases linearly with matrix bandwidth size,
making faster reduction of larger matrix bandwidths now also possible. With
this work, we break memory bandwidth barriers, as well as matrix bandwidth
barriers, resulting in orders-of-magnitude faster algorithms for the reduction
of banded matrices to bidiagonal form on the GPU.

Conclusion: MOBO与HITL结合的方法可广泛应用于多目标实验问题，特别是输入参数相互关联且实验失败率高的场景

Abstract: Neuromorphic computing hardware enables edge computing and can be implemented
in flexible electronics for novel applications. Metal oxide materials are
promising candidates for fabricating flexible neuromorphic electronics, but
suffer from processing constraints due to the incompatibilities between oxides
and polymer substrates. In this work, we use photonic curing to fabricate
flexible metal-insulator-metal capacitors with solution-processible aluminum
oxide dielectric tailored for neuromorphic applications. Because photonic
curing outcomes depend on many input parameters, identifying an optimal
processing condition through a traditional grid-search approach is unfeasible.
Here, we apply multi-objective Bayesian optimization (MOBO) to determine
photonic curing conditions that optimize the trade-off between desired
electrical properties of large capacitance-frequency dispersion and low leakage
current. Furthermore, we develop a human-in-the-loop (HITL) framework for
incorporating failed experiments into the MOBO machine learning workflow,
demonstrating that this framework accelerates optimization by reducing the
number of experimental rounds required. Once optimization is concluded, we
analyze different Pareto-optimal conditions to tune the dielectrics properties
and provide insight into the importance of different inputs through Shapley
Additive exPlanations analysis. The demonstrated framework of combining MOBO
with HITL feedback can be adapted to a wide range of multi-objective
experimental problems that have interconnected inputs and high experimental
failure rates to generate usable results for machine learning models.

Abstract: In this study, we demonstrate the first realization of wireless strain and
temperature sensing within 3D-printed metallic structures using standard
electromagnetic inspection hardware. This establishes a path toward need-based
parts maintenance driven by accurate damage assessments instead of relying on
regularly scheduled maintenance teardowns, extending the service intervals of
structures operating in harsh environments. To this end, we encapsulate
magnetoelastic and thermomagnetic materials inside microtubes and embed the
sensing elements during additive manufacturing. Mechanical and thermal stimuli
affect the magnetic permeability of the embedded materials, which modulates the
impedance of a coil placed on or near the surface of the printed part. We
demonstrate strain sensing accurate to +/-27x10-6 over at least a 6x10-4 strain
range, and temperature sensing accurate to +/-0.75oC over a 70oC range, both to
a 95% confidence interval. We highlight these sensors' capabilities by
detecting the onset of plasticity and fatigue-driven crack growth thousands of
cycles before critical failure. This extends non-destructive eddy-current
damage detection to accurate, real-time strain and temperature monitoring
within metallic structures.

Abstract: We address a novel staff allocation problem that arises in the organization
of collaborators among multiple school sites and educational levels. The
problem emerges from a real case study in a public school in Calabria, Italy,
where staff members must be distributed across kindergartens, primary, and
secondary schools under constraints of availability, competencies, and
fairness. To tackle this problem, we develop an optimization model and
investigate a solution approach based on quantum annealing. Our computational
experiments on real-world data show that quantum annealing is capable of
producing balanced assignments in short runtimes. These results provide
evidence of the practical applicability of quantum optimization methods in
educational scheduling and, more broadly, in complex resource allocation tasks.
