To address this, reusing historical Key-Value (KV) Cache for\nimproved inference efficiency has become a mainstream approach. Recent advances\nfurther enhance throughput by sparse attention mechanisms to select the most\nrelevant KV Cache, thereby reducing sequence length. However, such techniques\nare limited to single-context scenarios, where historical KV Cache is computed\nsequentially with causal-attention dependencies. In retrieval-augmented\ngeneration (RAG) scenarios, where retrieved documents as context are unknown\nbeforehand, each document's KV Cache is computed and stored independently\n(termed multiple-context KV Cache), lacking cross-attention between contexts.\nThis renders existing methods ineffective. Although prior work partially\nrecomputes multiple-context KV Cache to mitigate accuracy loss from missing\ncross-attention, it requires retaining all KV Cache throughout, failing to\nreduce memory overhead. This paper presents SamKV, the first exploration of\nattention sparsification for multiple-context KV Cache. Specifically, SamKV\ntakes into account the complementary information of other contexts when\nsparsifying one context, and then locally recomputes the sparsified\ninformation.

CRTR achieves strong results on domains with complex\ntemporal structure, such as Sokoban and Rubik's Cube. In particular, for the\nRubik's Cube, CRTR learns representations that generalize across all initial\nstates and allow it to solve the puzzle using fewer search steps than BestFS,\nthough with longer solutions. To our knowledge, this is the first method that\nefficiently solves arbitrary Cube states using only learned representations,\nwithout relying on an external search algorithm."}

Existing studies predominantly focus on the microscopic aspects\nof human trajectories: such as predicting short-term trajectories or the next\nlocation visited, while offering limited attention to macro-level mobility\npatterns and the corresponding life routines. In this paper, we focus on an\nunderexplored problem in human mobility prediction: determining the best\npractices to train a machine learning model using historical data to forecast\nan individuals complete trajectory over the next days and weeks. In this\nexperiment paper, we undertake a comprehensive experimental analysis of diverse\nmodels, parameter configurations, and training strategies, accompanied by an\nin-depth examination of the statistical distribution inherent in human mobility\npatterns. Our empirical evaluations encompass both Long Short-Term Memory and\nTransformer-based architectures, and further investigate how incorporating\nindividual life patterns can enhance the effectiveness of the prediction. We\nshow that explicitly including semantic information such as day-of-the-week and\nuser-specific historical information can help the model better understand\nindividual patterns of life and improve predictions. Moreover, since the\nabsence of explicit user information is often missing due to user privacy, we\nshow that the sampling of users may exacerbate data skewness and result in a\nsubstantial loss in predictive accuracy. To mitigate data imbalance and\npreserve diversity, we apply user semantic clustering with stratified sampling\nto ensure that the sampled dataset remains representative. Our results further\nshow that small-batch stochastic gradient optimization improves model\nperformance, especially when human mobility training data is limited."}

However, they suffer from a key discrepancy between\ntraining and inference: during inference, MDLMs progressively reveal the\nstructure of the generated sequence by producing fewer and fewer masked tokens,\nwhereas this structure is ignored in training as tokens are masked at random.\nAlthough this discrepancy between training and inference can lead to suboptimal\nperformance, it has been largely overlooked by previous works, leaving closing\nthis gap between the two stages an open problem. To address this, we frame the\nproblem of learning effective denoising trajectories as a sequential\ndecision-making problem and use the resulting framework to apply reinforcement\nlearning. We propose a novel Masked Diffusion Policy Optimization (MDPO) to\nexploit the Markov property diffusion possesses and explicitly train the model\nunder the same progressive refining schedule used at inference. MDPO matches\nthe performance of the previous state-of-the-art (SOTA) method with 60x fewer\ngradient updates, while achieving average improvements of 9.6% on MATH500 and\n54.2% on Countdown over SOTA when trained within the same number of weight\nupdates. Additionally, we improve the remasking strategy of MDLMs as a plug-in\ninference replacement to overcome the limitation that the model cannot refine\ntokens flexibly. This simple yet effective training-free strategy, what we\nrefer to as RCR, consistently improves performance and yields additional gains\nwhen combined with MDPO. Our findings establish great potential for\ninvestigating the discrepancy between pre-training and inference of MDLMs.\nCode: https://github.com/autonomousvision/mdpo.
