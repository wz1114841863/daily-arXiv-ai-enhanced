This paper introduces Mozart, a chiplet ecosystem and\naccelerator codesign framework that systematically constructs low cost bespoke\napplication-specific integrated circuits (BASICs). BASICs leverage\noperator-level disaggregation to explore chiplet and memory heterogeneity,\ntensor fusion, and tensor parallelism, with place-and-route validation ensuring\nphysical implementability.

In this paper, we\nintroduce Energy-Driven Steering (EDS), a novel, fine-tuning free framework\ndesigned to resolve this challenge through dynamic, inference-time\nintervention. We trained a lightweight, external Energy-Based Model (EBM) to\nassign high energy to undesirable (false refusal or jailbreak) states and low\nenergy to desirable (helpful response or safe reject) ones.

Accepted at NeurIPS 2025", "summary": "We study the problem of sampling from a distribution under local differential\nprivacy (LDP). Given a private distribution $P \\in \\mathcal{P}$, the goal is to\ngenerate a single sample from a distribution that remains close to $P$ in\n$f$-divergence while satisfying the constraints of LDP. This task captures the\nfundamental challenge of producing realistic-looking data under strong privacy\nguarantees. While prior work by Park et al. (NeurIPS'24) focuses on global\nminimax-optimality across a class of distributions, we take a local\nperspective. Specifically, we examine the minimax risk in a neighborhood around\na fixed distribution $P_0$, and characterize its exact value, which depends on\nboth $P_0$ and the privacy level. Our main result shows that the local minimax\nrisk is determined by the global minimax risk when the distribution class\n$\\mathcal{P}$ is restricted to a neighborhood around $P_0$. To establish this,\nwe (1) extend previous work from pure LDP to the more general functional LDP\nframework, and (2) prove that the globally optimal functional LDP sampler\nyields the optimal local sampler when constrained to distributions near $P_0$.\nBuilding on this, we also derive a simple closed-form expression for the\nlocally minimax-optimal samplers which does not depend on the choice of\n$f$-divergence. We further argue that this local framework naturally models\nprivate sampling with public data, where the public data distribution is\nrepresented by $P_0$. In this setting, we empirically compare our locally\noptimal sampler to existing global methods, and demonstrate that it\nconsistently outperforms global minimax samplers."}

These second-order bounds provide an instance-dependent result\nthat can scale with the variance of returns under the relevant policies and\ntherefore tighten as the system approaches determinism. Together with\nsecond-order, information-theoretic lower bounds on a newly constructed\nhard-instance family, we show that MB-AIL attains minimax-optimal sample\ncomplexity for online interaction (up to logarithmic factors) with limited\nexpert demonstrations and matches the lower bound for expert demonstrations in\nterms of the dependence on horizon $H$, precision $\\epsilon$ and the policy\nvariance $\\sigma^2$.

To address these issues, we propose Geo-STARS, a\ngeo-aware spatio-temporal modeling framework for predicting stream water\ntemperature across different watersheds and spatial scales. The major\ninnovation of Geo-STARS is the introduction of geo-aware embedding, which\nleverages geographic information to explicitly capture shared principles and\npatterns across spatial regions and scales.

STaTS detects change points\nacross multiple temporal resolutions using a BIC-based statistical divergence\ncriterion, then summarizes each segment using simple functions like the mean or\ngenerative models such as GMMs. This process achieves up to 30x sequence\ncompression while retaining core temporal dynamics. STaTS operates as a\nmodel-agnostic preprocessor and can be integrated with existing unsupervised\ntime series encoders without retraining. Extensive experiments on 150+\ndatasets, including classification tasks on the UCR-85, UCR-128, and UEA-30\narchives, and forecasting on ETTh1 and ETTh2, ETTm1, and Electricity,\ndemonstrate that STaTS enables 85-90\\% of the full-model performance while\noffering dramatic reductions in computational cost.

However, in the\nhardest instances of important problems, two problems arise: (1) the base\ngenerative model attains a near-zero reward signal, and (2) calls to the reward\noracle are expensive. This setting poses a fundamentally different learning\nchallenge than standard reward-based post-training. To address this, we propose\nBaNEL (Bayesian Negative Evidence Learning), an algorithm that post-trains the\nmodel using failed attempts only, while minimizing the number of reward\nevaluations (NREs).
