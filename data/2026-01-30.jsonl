Accepted for lecture presentation at the 2026 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems (ISCAS 2026)", "summary": "Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) offer a biologically plausible learning mechanism through synaptic plasticity, enabling unsupervised adaptation without the computational overhead of backpropagation. To harness this capability for robotics, this paper presents FireFly-P, an FPGA-based hardware accelerator that implements a novel plasticity algorithm for real-time adaptive control. By leveraging on-chip plasticity, our architecture enhances the network's generalization, ensuring robust performance in dynamic and unstructured environments. The hardware design achieves an end-to-end latency of just 8~$μ$s for both inference and plasticity updates, enabling rapid adaptation to unseen scenarios. Implemented on a tiny Cmod A7-35T FPGA, FireFly-P consumes only 0.713~W and $\\sim$10K~LUTs, making it ideal for power- and resource-constrained embedded robotic platforms. This work demonstrates that hardware-accelerated SNN plasticity is a viable path toward enabling adaptive, low-latency, and energy-efficient control systems."}

This article introduces Frequency-as-Aperture (FaA), a wireless-first sensing paradigm that repurposes inherent frequency agility into a virtual sensing aperture, enabling near-field perception with minimal RF front end complexity. Using a single RF chain and a frequency-scanning leaky-wave antenna, FaA achieves two dimensional spatial sensing by reusing the local oscillator (LO) frequency sweep already employed for wideband communication. From a wireless-system perspective, this shifts spatial sampling from the antenna domain to the frequency domain, embedding radar-grade spatial fingerprints directly into the communication RF chain. A case study shows that FaA provides fine angular and range discrimination with low power consumption and unit cost, demonstrating significantly higher architectural efficiency than conventional multi-channel MIMO based sensing under identical physical and spectral constraints. These results indicate that near-field sensing can be seamlessly integrated into frequency-agile wireless radios, enabling hardware-efficient, embeddable, and privacy-preserving ISAC nodes for smart homes, wearables, and industrial edge deployments."}

PowerGenie introduces: (1) an automated analytical framework that determines converter functionality and theoretical performance limits without component sizing or SPICE simulation, and (2) an evolutionary finetuning method that co-evolves a generative model with its training distribution through fitness selection and uniqueness verification.

Eisenstein-Jacobi (EJ) networks, with their symmetric 6-regular topology, offer superior topological properties but challenge traditional routing heuristics under fault conditions. This paper evaluates three routing paradigms in faulty EJ environments: deterministic Greedy Adaptive Routing, theoretically optimal Dijkstra's algorithm, and a reinforcement learning (RL)-based approach. Using a multi-objective reward function to penalize fault proximity and reward path efficiency, the RL agent learns to navigate around clustered failures that typically induce dead-ends in greedy geometric routing. Dijkstra's algorithm establishes the theoretical performance ceiling by computing globally optimal paths with complete topology knowledge, revealing the true connectivity limits of faulty networks. Quantitative analysis at nine faulty nodes shows greedy routing catastrophically degrades to 10% effective reachability and packet delivery, while Dijkstra proves 52-54% represents the topological optimum. The RL agent achieves 94% effective reachability and 91% packet delivery, making it suitable for distributed deployment. Furthermore, throughput evaluations demonstrate that RL sustains over 90% normalized throughput across all loads, actually outperforming Dijkstra under congestion through implicit load balancing strategies. These results establish RL-based adaptive policies as a practical solution that bridges the gap between greedy's efficiency and Dijkstra's optimality, providing robust, self-healing communication in fault-prone interconnection networks without requiring the global topology knowledge or computational overhead of optimal algorithms."}

Instead of relying on manual design, this LLM-Driven Heuristic Design (LHD) process leverages LLMs to iteratively generate and refine solvers to achieve high performance. However, existing LHD frameworks face two critical limitations: (1) Endpoint-only evaluation, which ranks solvers solely by final quality, ignoring the convergence process and runtime efficiency; (2) High adaptation costs, where distribution shifts necessitate re-adaptation to generate specialized solvers for new instance groups. To address these issues, we propose Dynamics-Aware Solver Heuristics (DASH), a framework that co-optimizes solver search mechanisms and runtime schedules guided by a convergence-aware metric, thereby identifying efficient and high-performance solvers. Furthermore, to mitigate expensive re-adaptation, DASH incorporates Profiled Library Retrieval (PLR). PLR efficiently archives specialized solvers concurrently with the evolutionary process, enabling cost-effective warm-starts for heterogeneous distributions. Experiments on four combinatorial optimization problems demonstrate that DASH improves runtime efficiency by over 3 times, while surpassing the solution quality of state-of-the-art baselines across diverse problem scales. Furthermore, by enabling profile-based warm starts, DASH maintains superior accuracy under different distributions while cutting LLM adaptation costs by over 90%."}

We demonstrate that this mechanism subsumes classical distributed system methods such as PTIDES, Chandy-and-Misra with or without null messages, Jefferson's Time-Warp, and Lamport's time-based fault detection, while enabling real-time behavior in distributed cyber-physical applications. The mechanism can also realize many commonly used distributed system patterns, including logical execution time (LET), publish and subscribe, actors, conflict-free replicated data types (CRDTs), and remote procedure calls with futures. More importantly, it adds to these mechanisms better control over timing, bounded time fault detection, and the option of making them more deterministic, all within a single semantic framework. Implemented as an extension of the Lingua Franca coordination language, maxwait enforces logical-time consistency when communication latencies are bounded and provides structured fault handling when bounds are violated."}

We propose Finetune-Informed Pretraining (FIP), a model-agnostic method that biases representation learning toward a designated target modality needed at fine-tuning time. FIP combines higher masking difficulty, stronger loss weighting, and increased decoder capacity for the target modality, without modifying the shared encoder or requiring additional supervision. When applied to masked modeling on constellation diagrams for wireless signals, FIP consistently improves downstream fine-tuned performance with no extra data or compute. FIP is simple to implement, architecture-compatible, and broadly applicable across multimodal masked modeling pipelines."}

Each foundation model can spawn large numbers of fine-tunes, adapters, quantizations, merges, and forks. We take the position that compute efficiency alone is insufficient for sustainability in open-source AI: lower per-run costs can accelerate experimentation and deployment, increasing aggregate environmental footprint unless impacts are measurable and comparable across derivative lineages. However, the energy use, water consumption, and emissions of these derivative lineages are rarely measured or disclosed in a consistent, comparable manner, leaving ecosystem-level impact largely invisible. We argue that sustainable open-source AI requires coordination infrastructure that tracks impacts across model lineages, not only base models. We propose Data and Impact Accounting (DIA), a lightweight, non-restrictive transparency layer that (i) standardizes carbon and water reporting metadata, (ii) integrates low-friction measurement into common training and inference pipelines, and (iii) aggregates reports through public dashboards to summarize cumulative impacts across releases and derivatives.

In this paper, we introduce such an approach, leveraging gamified incentives and a model for user's acceptance on incentives, thus encouraging energy-efficient behaviors such as adaptive bitrate streaming. Each user is characterized by an environmental sensitivity factor and a private incentive threshold, shaping probabilistic responses to energy-saving offers. A serious-game mechanism based on positive behavioral reinforcement and rewards of the users, due to their inclusion in top-K and bottom-M rankings, fosters peer comparison and competition, thus transforming passive acceptance into active engagement. Moreover, within a Stackelberg game formulation, the video streaming service provider--acting as the strategic leader--optimizes both incentive levels and game parameters to achieve network-wide energy and traffic reductions, while adhering to budgetary constraints. This structured approach empowers providers with proactive, application-level control over energy consumption, offering them measurable benefits such as reduced high-bitrate traffic and increased participation in energy-saving behaviors, while also considering user satisfaction. The results of our simulations show that indeed gamification boosts significantly user participation and energy savings provided that the incentive and game parameters are chosen optimally."}

This framework constructs a global prompt pool and introduces a task-aware gated routing mechanism that sparsely activates a subset of prompts to achieve dynamic decoupling and collaborative optimization of task-specific feature representations. Furthermore, we introduce a history-aware modulator that leverages cumulative prompt activation statistics to protect frequently used prompts from excessive updates, thereby mitigating inefficient parameter usage and knowledge forgetting.

While reducing streaming bitrates improves energy efficiency, its success hinges on user acceptance--particularly when lower bitrates may be perceived as reduced quality of experience (QoE). Therefore, there is a need to develop transparent, user-centric incentive models that balance sustainability with perceived value. We propose a user-acceptance model that combines diverse environmental awareness, personalized responsiveness to incentives, and varying levels of altruism into a unified probabilistic framework. The model incorporates dynamic, individualized incentives that adapt over time. We further enhance the framework by incorporating (i) social well-being as a motivator for altruistic choices, (ii) provider-driven education strategies that gradually adjust user acceptance thresholds, and (iii) data-driven learning of user traits from historical offer--response interactions. Extensive synthetic-data experiments reveal the trade-offs between provider cost and network flexibility, showing that personalized incentives and gradual behavioral adaptation can advance sustainability targets without compromising stakeholder requirements."}

Detecting these patterns automatically remains challenging due to the scarcity of labeled real-world data and strict privacy constraints. To address this, we investigate whether Graph Autoencoders (GAEs) can effectively learn and distinguish topological patterns that mimic money laundering operations when trained on synthetic data. The analysis consists of two phases: (i) data generation, where synthetic samples are created for seven well-known illicit activity patterns using parametrized generators that preserve structural consistency while introducing realistic variability; and (ii) model training and validation, where separate GAEs are trained on each pattern without explicit labels, relying solely on reconstruction error as an indicator of learned structure. We compare three GAE implementations based on three distinct convolutional layers: Graph Convolutional (GAE-GCN), GraphSAGE (GAE-SAGE), and Graph Attention Network (GAE-GAT). Experimental results show that GAE-GCN achieves the most consistent reconstruction performance across patterns, while GAE-SAGE and GAE-GAT exhibit competitive results only in few specific patterns.

We leverage the Central Limit Theorem (CLT) to prove mathematically that variables' beliefs under BP converge to a Gaussian distribution in complex, loopy factor graphs obeying our 4 key assumptions. We then confirm experimentally that variable beliefs become increasingly Gaussian after just a few BP iterations in a stereo depth estimation task."}

While \"LLM-as-a-Judge\" offers scalability, judge imperfections, noise, and bias can invalidate statistical guarantees. We introduce a \"Noisy but Valid\" hypothesis testing framework to address this. By leveraging a small human-labelled calibration set to estimate the judge's True Positive and False Positive Rates (TPR/FPR), we derive a variance-corrected critical threshold applied to a large judge-labelled dataset. Crucially, our framework theoretically guarantees finite-sample Type-I error control (validity) despite calibration uncertainty. This distinguishes our work from Prediction-Powered Inference (PPI), positioning our method as a diagnostic tool that explicitly models judge behavior rather than a black-box estimator. Our contributions include: (1) Theoretical Guarantees: We derive the exact conditions under which noisy testing yields higher statistical power than direct evaluation; (2) Empirical Validation: Experiments on Jigsaw Comment, Hate Speech and SafeRLHF confirm our theory; (3) The Oracle Gap: We reveal a significant performance gap between practical methods and the theoretical \"Oracle\" (perfectly known judge parameters), quantifying the cost of estimation. Specifically, we provide the first systematic treatment of the imperfect-judge setting, yielding interpretable diagnostics of judge reliability and clarifying how evaluation power depends on judge quality, dataset size, and certification levels. Together, these results sharpen understanding of statistical evaluation with LLM judges, and highlight trade-offs among competing inferential tools."}

This article introduces Frequency-as-Aperture (FaA), a wireless-first sensing paradigm that repurposes inherent frequency agility into a virtual sensing aperture, enabling near-field perception with minimal RF front end complexity. Using a single RF chain and a frequency-scanning leaky-wave antenna, FaA achieves two dimensional spatial sensing by reusing the local oscillator (LO) frequency sweep already employed for wideband communication. From a wireless-system perspective, this shifts spatial sampling from the antenna domain to the frequency domain, embedding radar-grade spatial fingerprints directly into the communication RF chain. A case study shows that FaA provides fine angular and range discrimination with low power consumption and unit cost, demonstrating significantly higher architectural efficiency than conventional multi-channel MIMO based sensing under identical physical and spectral constraints. These results indicate that near-field sensing can be seamlessly integrated into frequency-agile wireless radios, enabling hardware-efficient, embeddable, and privacy-preserving ISAC nodes for smart homes, wearables, and industrial edge deployments."}

In widely used attention implementations such as FlashAttention-3, the deterministic backward pass can incur up to a 37.9% throughput reduction relative to its non-deterministic counterpart, primarily because gradient accumulation operations must be serialized to guarantee numerical consistency. This performance loss stems from suboptimal scheduling of compute and gradient-reduction phases, leading to significant hardware underutilization.\n  To address this challenge, we formulate the backward pass of deterministic attention as a scheduling problem on a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) and derive schedules that minimize the critical path length. Building on this formulation, we present DASH (Deterministic Attention Scheduling for High-Throughput), which encapsulates two complementary scheduling strategies: (i) Descending Q-Tile Iteration, a reversed query-block traversal that shrinks pipeline stalls in causal attention, and (ii) Shift Scheduling, a theoretically optimal schedule within our DAG model that reduces pipeline stalls for both full and causal masks.\n  Our empirical evaluations on NVIDIA H800 GPUs demonstrate that DASH narrows the performance gap of deterministic attention.

We developed a bespoke machine learning algorithm that integrates system identification and ranking-constrained optimization to estimate mean ICP from noninvasive signals. Methods: A machine learning framework was proposed to obtain accurate mean ICP values using arbitrary noninvasive signals. The subspace system identification algorithm is employed to identify cerebral hemodynamics models for ICP simulation using arterial blood pressure (ABP), cerebral blood velocity (CBv), and R-wave to R-wave interval (R-R interval) signals in a comprehensive database. A mapping function to describe the relationship between the features of noninvasive signals and the estimation errors is learned using innovative ranking constraints through convex optimization. Patients across multiple clinical settings were randomly split into testing and training datasets for performance evaluation of the mapping function. Results: The results indicate that about 31.88% of testing entries achieved estimation errors within 2 mmHg and 34.07% of testing entries between 2 mmHg to 6 mmHg from the nonlinear mapping with constraints.

As a result, a single MVM requires many compute cycles, and weights cannot be efficiently stored in a single crossbar cell. To address this problem, we propose a mixed-precision training and compilation framework for CIM architectures. The biggest challenge is the massive search space, that makes it difficult to find good quantization parameters. This is why we introduce a reinforcement learning-based strategy to find suitable quantization configurations that balance latency and accuracy. In the best case, our approach achieves up to a 2.48x speedup over existing state-of-the-art solutions, with an accuracy loss of only 0.086 %."}

We propose Homogeneous-Monotone Radial Inverse (HM-RI) networks, structured neural architectures that enforce key monotonicity and homogeneity properties, enabling fast projection estimation. We provide a theoretical characterisation of radial inverse functions and show that, under mild structural conditions, a HM-RI predictor corresponds to the radial inverse of a valid set of monotone constraints. To reduce training overhead, we further develop relaxed monotonicity conditions that remain compatible with POA.

Existing approaches fall into two disjoint paradigms: models trained for generalization across instances, and instance-specific models optimized independently at test time. While the former are efficient during inference, they lack effective instance-wise adaptability; the latter are flexible but fail to exploit learned inductive structure and are prone to poor local optima. This motivates the central question of our work: how can we leverage the inductive bias learned through generalization while unlocking the flexibility required for effective instance-wise adaptation? We first identify a challenge in bridging these two paradigms: generalization-focused models often constitute poor warm starts for instance-wise optimization, potentially underperforming even randomly initialized models when fine-tuned at test time. To resolve this incompatibility, we propose TACO, a model-agnostic test-time adaptation framework that unifies and extends the two existing paradigms for unsupervised NCO. TACO applies strategic warm-starting to partially relax trained parameters while preserving inductive bias, enabling rapid and effective unsupervised adaptation. Crucially, compared to naively fine-tuning a trained generalizable model or optimizing an instance-specific model from scratch, TACO achieves better solution quality while incurring negligible additional computational cost. Experiments on canonical CO problems, Minimum Vertex Cover and Maximum Clique, demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of TACO across static, distribution-shifted, and dynamic combinatorial optimization problems, establishing it as a practical bridge between generalizable and instance-specific unsupervised NCO."}

In operational environments, however, monitoring systems frequently experience sensor churn. Signals may appear, disappear, or be renamed, creating data windows where the cardinality varies and may include values unseen during training. To address this challenge, we propose SMKC, a framework that decouples the dynamic input structure from the anomaly detector. We first employ permutation-invariant feature hashing to sketch raw inputs into a fixed size state sequence. We then construct a hybrid kernel image to capture global temporal structure through pairwise comparisons of the sequence and its derivatives. The model learns normal patterns using masked reconstruction and a teacher-student prediction objective. Our evaluation reveals that robust log-distance channels provide the primary discriminative signal, whereas cosine representations often fail to capture sufficient contrast. Notably, we find that a detector using random projections and nearest neighbors on the SMKC representation performs competitively with fully trained baselines without requiring gradient updates. This highlights the effectiveness of the representation itself and offers a practical cold-start solution for resource-constrained deployments."}

Given task-specific information, LLMs can propose diverse feature transformation operations to enhance downstream model performance. However, current approaches typically assign the LLM as a black-box optimizer, responsible for both proposing and selecting operations based solely on its internal heuristics, which often lack calibrated estimations of operation utility and consequently lead to repeated exploration of low-yield operations without a principled strategy for prioritizing promising directions. In this paper, we propose a human-LLM collaborative feature engineering framework for tabular learning. We begin by decoupling the transformation operation proposal and selection processes, where LLMs are used solely to generate operation candidates, while the selection is guided by explicitly modeling the utility and uncertainty of each proposed operation. Since accurate utility estimation can be difficult especially in the early rounds of feature engineering, we design a mechanism within the framework that selectively elicits and incorporates human expert preference feedback, comparing which operations are more promising, into the selection process to help identify more effective operations. Our evaluations on both the synthetic study and the real user study demonstrate that the proposed framework improves feature engineering performance across a variety of tabular datasets and reduces users' cognitive load during the feature engineering process."}

Recent approaches that propagate textual feedback globally (e.g., TextGrad) make it feasible to optimize such pipelines, but we find that performance degrades as system depth grows. In particular, long-horizon agentic workflows exhibit two depth-scaling failure modes: 1) exploding textual gradient, where textual feedback grows exponentially with depth, leading to prohibitively long message and amplifies evaluation biases; and 2) vanishing textual gradient, where limited long-context ability causes models overemphasize partial feedback and compression of lengthy feedback causes downstream messages to lose specificity gradually as they propagate many hops upstream. To mitigate these issues, we introduce Textual Equilibrium Propagation (TEP), a local learning principle inspired by Equilibrium Propagation in energy-based models. TEP includes two phases: 1) a free phase where a local LLM critics iteratively refine prompts until reaching equilibrium (no further improvements are suggested); and 2) a nudged phase which applies proximal prompt edits with bounded modification intensity, using task-level objectives that propagate via forward signaling rather than backward feedback chains. This design supports local prompt optimization followed by controlled adaptation toward global goals without the computational burden and signal degradation of global textual backpropagation. Across long-horizon QA benchmarks and multi-agent tool-use dataset, TEP consistently improves accuracy and efficiency over global propagation methods such as TextGrad. The gains grows with depth, while preserving the practicality of black-box LLM components in deep compound AI system."}

In this survey, we review recent progress on GFMs from the perspective of out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization. We first discuss the main challenges posed by distribution shifts in graph learning and outline a unified problem setting. We then organize existing approaches based on whether they are designed to operate under a fixed task specification or to support generalization across heterogeneous task formulations, and summarize the corresponding OOD handling strategies and pretraining objectives. Finally, we review common evaluation protocols and discuss open directions for future research. To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first survey for OOD generalization in GFMs."}

Our theoretical contributions establish that both the latent causal variables and the continuous mixing trajectory are jointly identifiable. We further propose TRACE, a Mixture-of-Experts framework where each expert learns one atomic mechanism during training, enabling recovery of mechanism trajectories at test time. This formulation generalizes to intermediate mechanism states never observed during training. Experiments on synthetic and real-world data demonstrate that TRACE recovers mixing trajectories with up to 0.99 correlation, substantially outperforming discrete-switching baselines."}

For the first time, we introduce a dynamic cutoff formulation that still leads to stable, long timescale molecular dynamics simulation. In introducing the dynamic cutoff, we are able to induce sparsity onto the underlying atom graph by targeting a specific number of neighbors per atom, significantly reducing both memory consumption and inference time. We show the effectiveness of a dynamic cutoff by implementing it onto 4 state of the art MLIPs: MACE, Nequip, Orbv3, and TensorNet, leading to 2.26x less memory consumption and 2.04x faster inference time, depending on the model and atomic system.

Existing approaches, however, focus primarily on place identity derived from static textual metadata, or learn representations tied to trajectory context, which capture movement regularities rather than how places are actually used (i.e., POI's function). We argue that POI function is a missing but essential signal for general POI representations. We introduce Mobility-Embedded POIs (ME-POIs), a framework that augments POI embeddings derived, from language models with large-scale human mobility data to learn POI-centric, context-independent representations grounded in real-world usage. ME-POIs encodes individual visits as temporally contextualized embeddings and aligns them with learnable POI representations via contrastive learning to capture usage patterns across users and time. To address long-tail sparsity, we propose a novel mechanism that propagates temporal visit patterns from nearby, frequently visited POIs across multiple spatial scales. We evaluate ME-POIs on five newly proposed map enrichment tasks, testing its ability to capture both the identity and function of POIs. Across all tasks, augmenting text-based embeddings with ME-POIs consistently outperforms both text-only and mobility-only baselines. Notably, ME-POIs trained on mobility data alone can surpass text-only models on certain tasks, highlighting that POI function is a critical component of accurate and generalizable POI representations."}

An Investigation Into the Group-theoretic Structures Learned By Narrow Models Trained To Predict Group Operations", "comment": "Presented at TAG-DS 2025", "summary": "While a real-world research program in mathematics may be guided by a motivating question, the process of mathematical discovery is typically open-ended. Ideally, exploration needed to answer the original question will reveal new structures, patterns, and insights that are valuable in their own right. This contrasts with the exam-style paradigm in which the machine learning community typically applies AI to math. To maximize progress in mathematics using AI, we will need to go beyond simple question answering. With this in mind, we explore the extent to which narrow models trained to solve a fixed mathematical task learn broader mathematical structure that can be extracted by a researcher or other AI system. As a basic test case for this, we use the task of training a neural network to predict a group operation (for example, performing modular arithmetic or composition of permutations). We describe a suite of tests designed to assess whether the model captures significant group-theoretic notions such as the identity element, commutativity, or subgroups. Through extensive experimentation we find evidence that models learn representations capable of capturing abstract algebraic properties. For example, we find hints that models capture the commutativity of modular arithmetic. We are also able to train linear classifiers that reliably distinguish between elements of certain subgroups (even though no labels for these subgroups are included in the data). On the other hand, we are unable to extract notions such as the concept of the identity element. Together, our results suggest that in some cases the representations of even small neural networks can be used to distill interesting abstract structure from new mathematical objects."}

This representation is particularly problematic for advection, where long-range transport must be treated with expensive global interaction mechanisms or through deep, stacked convolutional layers. To mitigate this, we present PARADIS, a physics-inspired global weather prediction model that imposes inductive biases on network behavior through a functional decomposition into advection, diffusion, and reaction blocks acting on latent variables. We implement advection through a Neural Semi-Lagrangian operator that performs trajectory-based transport via differentiable interpolation on the sphere, enabling end-to-end learning of both the latent modes to be transported and their characteristic trajectories. Diffusion-like processes are modeled through depthwise-separable spatial mixing, while local source terms and vertical interactions are modeled via pointwise channel interactions, enabling operator-level physical structure. PARADIS provides state-of-the-art forecast skill at a fraction of the training cost. On ERA5-based benchmarks, the 1 degree PARADIS model, with a total training cost of less than a GPU month, meets or exceeds the performance of 0.25 degree traditional and machine-learning baselines, including the ECMWF HRES forecast and DeepMind's GraphCast."}

We propose AC2L-GAD, an Active Counterfactual Contrastive Learning framework that addresses both limitations through principled counterfactual reasoning. By combining information-theoretic active selection with counterfactual generation, our approach identifies structurally complex nodes and generates anomaly-preserving positive augmentations alongside normal negative counterparts that provide hard contrasts, while restricting expensive counterfactual generation to a strategically selected subset.

To overcome these challenges, in this paper, we propose an artificial intelligence discrimination framework based on a peak-aware conditional generative model to improve the reliability of GC-MS measurements under interference conditions. The framework is learned with a novel peak-aware mechanism that highlights the characteristic peaks of GC-MS data, allowing it to generate important spectral features more faithfully. In addition, chemical and solvent information is encoded in a latent vector embedded with it, allowing a conditional generative adversarial neural network (CGAN) to generate a synthetic GC-MS signal consistent with the experimental conditions. This generates an experimental dataset that assumes indirect substance situations in chemical substance data, where acquisition is limited without conducting real experiments. These data are used for the learning of AI-based GC-MS discrimination models to help in accurate chemical substance discrimination. We conduct various quantitative and qualitative evaluations of the generated simulated data to verify the validity of the proposed framework. We also verify how the generative model improves the performance of the AI discrimination framework.

While post-hoc explainable methods based on gradients and feature-based attributions have been popular, they suffer from reference state sensitivity and struggle to generalize across time-series datasets, as they treat time points independently and ignore sequential dependencies. Another perspective on explainable time-series classification is through interpretable components of the model, for instance, leveraging self-attention mechanisms to estimate temporal attribution; however, recent findings indicate that these attention weights often fail to provide faithful measures of temporal importance. In this work, we advance this perspective and present a novel explainability-driven deep learning framework, TimeSliver, which jointly utilizes raw time-series data and its symbolic abstraction to construct a representation that maintains the original temporal structure. Each element in this representation linearly encodes the contribution of each temporal segment to the final prediction, allowing us to assign a meaningful importance score to every time point. For time-series classification, TimeSliver outperforms other temporal attribution methods by 11% on 7 distinct synthetic and real-world multivariate time-series datasets. TimeSliver also achieves predictive performance within 2% of state-of-the-art baselines across 26 UEA benchmark datasets, positioning it as a strong and explainable framework for general time-series classification."}

A depthwise-separable convolutional stem captures micro-transients, a Tiny-Mamba state-space branch models near-linear long-range dynamics, and a lightweight local Transformer encodes cross-channel resonances. We derive an analytic temporal-to-spectral mapping that ties the model's attention spectrum to classical bearing fault-order bands, yielding a band-alignment score that quantifies physical plausibility and provides physics-grounded explanations. To ensure decision reliability, healthy-score exceedances are modeled with extreme-value theory (EVT), which yields an on-threshold achieving a target false-alarm intensity (events/hour); a dual-threshold hysteresis with a minimum hold time further suppresses chatter. Under a leakage-free streaming protocol with right-censoring of missed detections on CWRU, Paderborn, XJTU-SY, and an industrial pilot, PG-TMT attains higher precision-recall AUC (primary under imbalance), competitive or better ROC AUC, and shorter mean time-to-detect at matched false-alarm intensity, together with strong cross-domain transfer.

To enable truly efficient and seamless door-to-door travel experiences, UAM requires close integration with existing ground transportation infrastructure. However, current research on optimal integrated routing strategies for passengers in air-ground mobility systems remains limited, with a lack of systematic exploration.To address this gap, we first propose a unified optimization model that integrates strategy selection for both air and ground transportation. This model captures the dynamic characteristics of multimodal transport networks and incorporates real-time traffic conditions alongside passenger decision-making behavior. Building on this model, we propose a Unified Air-Ground Mobility Coordination (UAGMC) framework, which leverages deep reinforcement learning (RL) and Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communication to optimize vertiport selection and dynamically plan air taxi routes. Experimental results demonstrate that UAGMC achieves a 34\\% reduction in average travel time compared to conventional proportional allocation methods, enhancing overall travel efficiency and providing novel insights into the integration and optimization of multimodal transportation systems. This work lays a solid foundation for advancing intelligent urban mobility solutions through the coordination of air and ground transportation modes.

While adversarial transfer within neural networks is well-documented, whether classical ML pipelines using handcrafted features inherit this vulnerability when attacked via neural surrogates remains unexplored. Feature engineering creates information bottlenecks through gradient quantization and spatial binning, potentially filtering high-frequency adversarial signals. We evaluate this hypothesis through the first comprehensive study of adversarial transfer from DNNs to HOG-based classifiers. Using VGG16 as a surrogate, we generate FGSM and PGD adversarial examples and test transfer to four classical classifiers (KNN, Decision Tree, Linear SVM, Kernel SVM) and a shallow neural network across eight HOG configurations on CIFAR-10. Our results strongly refute the protective hypothesis: all classifiers suffer 16.6%-59.1% relative accuracy drops, comparable to neural-to-neural transfer. More surprisingly, we discover attack hierarchy reversal--contrary to patterns where iterative PGD dominates FGSM within neural networks, FGSM causes greater degradation than PGD in 100% of classical ML cases, suggesting iterative attacks overfit to surrogate-specific features that don't survive feature extraction. Block normalization provides partial but insufficient mitigation. These findings demonstrate that adversarial vulnerability is not an artifact of end-to-end differentiability but a fundamental property of image classification systems, with implications for security-critical deployments across computational paradigms."}

We show that uniform timestep sampling leads to unequal learning contributions across denoising steps due to differences in signal to noise ratio, which biases training toward memorization. To address this, we propose a timestep sampling strategy that explicitly controls where learning occurs along the denoising trajectory. By adjusting the width of the confidence interval, our method provides direct control over the memorization generalization trade off. Experiments on image and 1D signal generation tasks demonstrate that shifting learning emphasis toward later denoising steps consistently reduces memorization and improves distributional alignment with training data, validating the generality and effectiveness of our approach."}

In this work, we address this problem from a causal perspective by proposing a factored representation learning framework that decomposes the model's contextual embedding into (1) causal factors that are sufficient for reward prediction and (2) non-causal factors that capture reward-irrelevant attributes such as length or sycophantic bias. The reward head is then constrained to depend only on the causal component. In addition, we introduce an adversarial head trained to predict reward from the non-causal factors, while applying gradient reversal to discourage them from encoding reward-relevant information. Experiments on both mathematical and dialogue tasks demonstrate that our method learns more robust reward models and consistently improves downstream RLHF performance over state-of-the-art baselines.

In this context, we argue that reconciling the semantic-structural orthogonality and integrity between pre-trained language models (PLMs) and graph neural networks (GNNs) is paramount for developing effective FedGFMs while simultaneously mitigating the severe data heterogeneity and communication constraints inherent in distributed, resource-limited environments.\n  To address these issues, we propose FedGALA (Federated Graph And Language Alignment), a framework that resolves graph-based semantic-structural orthogonality and integrity in federated settings by employing unsupervised contrastive learning to align GNNs and frozen PLMs within a continuous embedding space, thereby capturing robust, transferable general knowledge. Subsequently, FedGALA leverages a communication-efficient prompt tuning mechanism to steer these pre-aligned encoders and frozen PLMs, facilitating effective adaptation to diverse downstream tasks while circumventing the prohibitive overhead of full-parameter fine-tuning. The comprehensive experiments validate that FedGALA outperforms all competitive baselines across multi-domain datasets on multiple tasks with up to 14.37% performance improvement."}

However, existing works do not effectively consider the impact of extraneous variables on the prediction of the target variable. On the other hand, they fail to fully extract complex sequence information based on various time patterns of the sequences. To address these drawbacks, we propose a DA-SPS model, which adopts different modules for feature extraction based on the information characteristics of different variables. DA-SPS mainly consists of two stages: the target variable processing stage (TVPS) and the extraneous variables processing stage (EVPS). In TVPS, the model first uses Singular Spectrum Analysis (SSA) to process the target variable sequence and then uses Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and P-Conv-LSTM which deploys a patching strategy to extract features from trend and seasonality components, respectively. In EVPS, the model filters extraneous variables that have a strong correlation with the target variate by using Spearman correlation analysis and further analyses them using the L-Attention module which consists of LSTM and attention mechanism. Finally, the results obtained by TVPS and EVPS are combined through weighted summation and linear mapping to produce the final prediction. The results on four public datasets demonstrate that the DA-SPS model outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods.

Most existing studies focus on parameter uncertainty, such as variable processing times, and typically adopt the actor-critic framework. In this paper, we explore a different but prevalent form of uncertainty in JSSP: structural uncertainty. Structural uncertainty arises when a job may follow one of several routing paths, and the selection is determined not by policy, but by situational factors (e.g., the quality of intermediate products) that cannot be known in advance. Existing methods struggle to address this challenge due to incorrect credit assignment: a high-quality action may be unfairly penalized if it is followed by a time-consuming path. To address this problem, we propose a novel method named UP-AAC. In contrast to conventional actor-critic methods, UP-AAC employs an asymmetric architecture. While its actor receives a standard stochastic state, the critic is crucially provided with a deterministic state reconstructed in hindsight. This design allows the critic to learn a more accurate value function, which in turn provides a lower-variance policy gradient to the actor, leading to more stable learning. In addition, we design an attention-based Uncertainty Perception Model (UPM) to enhance the actor's scheduling decisions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches in reducing makespan on benchmark instances."}

However, the former approach suffers from unstable credit assignment, while the latter exhibits sample inefficiency and sub-optimality. We propose a policy optimization framework that leverages multiple intrinsic rewards to directly optimize a policy for an extrinsic reward without pretraining subpolicies. Our algorithm -- intrinsic reward policy optimization (IRPO) -- achieves this by using a surrogate policy gradient that provides a more informative learning signal than the true gradient in sparse-reward environments.

Existing research attempts to mitigate overthinking from the perspective of prompt design or model training, but generally underestimates the importance of task difficulty awareness, which makes it difficult for LRMs to effectively allocate reasoning resources. In this paper, we propose Difficulty-aware Policy Optimization (DiPO), a reinforcement learning-based LRM training framework. DiPO encourages LRM to spontaneously model task complexity, and integrates them into reinforcement learning framework to adjust the generation preferences introduced by post-training. A difficulty modeling method based on model self-reasoning is proposed, which significantly reduces the dependence on manual annotation and formalize task complexity. We further develop a difficulty-signal-enhanced reward function that incorporates a penalty for lengthy reasoning while considering reasoning performance and output format.

Detecting these patterns automatically remains challenging due to the scarcity of labeled real-world data and strict privacy constraints. To address this, we investigate whether Graph Autoencoders (GAEs) can effectively learn and distinguish topological patterns that mimic money laundering operations when trained on synthetic data. The analysis consists of two phases: (i) data generation, where synthetic samples are created for seven well-known illicit activity patterns using parametrized generators that preserve structural consistency while introducing realistic variability; and (ii) model training and validation, where separate GAEs are trained on each pattern without explicit labels, relying solely on reconstruction error as an indicator of learned structure. We compare three GAE implementations based on three distinct convolutional layers: Graph Convolutional (GAE-GCN), GraphSAGE (GAE-SAGE), and Graph Attention Network (GAE-GAT). Experimental results show that GAE-GCN achieves the most consistent reconstruction performance across patterns, while GAE-SAGE and GAE-GAT exhibit competitive results only in few specific patterns. These findings suggest that graph-based representation learning on synthetic data provides a viable path toward developing AI-driven tools for detecting illicit behaviors, overcoming the limitations of financial datasets."}

This dependency prevents the model architecture from reusing native LLM vocabularies, resulting in high maintenance costs and poor scalability. In response, we aim to efficiently reuse open-source LLM architectures without constructing a separate tokenization vocabulary. Furthermore, we identify that the optimization strategy of OneRec Gradient Bounded Policy Optimization (GBPO),suffers from a \"Symmetric Conservatism\" problem: its static gradient boundaries structurally suppress the update momentum required for cold-start items and fail to prevent diversity collapse in high-noise environments.To address this issue, we propose SAGE (Sequence-level Adaptive Gradient Evolution), a unified optimization framework tailored for list-wise generative recommendation. SAGE introduces two key innovations:(1) Sequence-level Signal Decoupling: By combining a geometric mean importance ratio with decoupled multi-objective advantages, we eliminate token-level variance and resolve the \"Reward Collapse\" problem. (2) Asymmetric Adaptive Dynamics: We construct a dynamic gradient manifold that applies a \"Boost Factor\" to high-potential cold start items to achieve super-linear updates and employs an \"Entropy Aware Penalty\" to break information cocoons. Theoretical analysis and empirical results demonstrate that SAGE effectively unblocks cold-start traffic and sustains recommendation diversity, all while retaining the numerical stability of GBPO."}

In this work, we introduce the Large Lookup Layer (L$^3$), which unlocks a new axis of sparsity by generalizing embedding tables to model decoder layers. L$^3$ layers use static token-based routing to aggregate a set of learned embeddings per token in a context-dependent way, allowing the model to efficiently balance memory and compute by caching information in embeddings. L$^3$ has two main components: (1) a systems-friendly architecture that allows for fast training and CPU-offloaded inference with no overhead, and (2) an information-theoretic embedding allocation algorithm that effectively balances speed and quality. We empirically test L$^3$ by training transformers with up to 2.6B active parameters and find that L$^3$ strongly outperforms both dense models and iso-sparse MoEs in both language modeling and downstream tasks."}

We give a near-complete characterization of minimax regret for both deterministic and randomized learners in the set-realizable regime, i.e., in the regime where sublinear regret is generally attainable. For deterministic learners, we introduce the Partial-Feedback Littlestone dimension (PFLdim) and show it precisely governs learnability and minimax regret; technically, PFLdim cannot be defined via the standard version space, requiring a new collection version space viewpoint and an auxiliary dimension used only in the proof. We further develop the Partial-Feedback Measure Shattering dimension (PMSdim) to obtain tight bounds for randomized learners. We identify broad conditions ensuring inseparability between deterministic and randomized learnability (e.g., finite Helly number or nested-inclusion label structure), and extend the argument to set-valued online learning, resolving an open question of Raman et al. [2024b]. Finally, we show a sharp separation from weaker realistic and agnostic variants: outside set realizability, the problem can become information-theoretically intractable, with linear regret possible even for $|H|=2$. This highlights the need for fundamentally new, noise-sensitive complexity measures to meaningfully characterize learnability beyond set realizability."}

Consequently, standard multi-fidelity methods can mis-select the best arm, and uniform auditing, though accurate, wastes scarce resources and is inefficient. We prove that without bias correction and propensity adjustment, mis-selection probability may not vanish (even with unlimited proxy data). We then develop an estimator for the mean of each arm that combines proxy scores with inverse-propensity-weighted residuals and form anytime-valid confidence sequences for that estimator. Based on the estimator and confidence sequence, we propose an algorithm that adaptively selects and audits arms. The algorithm concentrates audits on unreliable contexts and close arms and we prove that a plug-in Neyman rule achieves near-oracle audit efficiency. Numerical experiments confirm the theoretical guarantees and demonstrate the superior empirical performance of the proposed algorithm."}

These are not selected from sampled generations but are newly synthesized by combining individual responses in the latent space. Across different tasks, Bayes-optimal responses consistently outperform standard decoding methods like beam search. Moreover, quantifying uncertainty via the induced Bayesian risk captures variations in terms of the latent structure and improves alignment with output quality and correctness.

We connect the two metrics and show that the empirically-observed power-law behavior in pass@k leads to a sublinear growth of the coverage@cost (diminishing returns). To solve this problem, we propose Reset-and-Discard (ReD), a query method of LLMs that increases coverage@cost for any given budget, regardless of the pass@k form. Moreover, given a pass@k, we can quantitatively predict the savings in the total number of attempts using ReD. If pass@k is not available for the model, ReD can infer its power-law exponent.

Second, concerning representational similarity, we prove that reconstruction-based metrics and standard tools (e.g., CKA, RSA) act as estimators of usable information under specific constraints. Crucially, we show that similarity is relative to the capacity of the predictive family: representations that appear distinct to a rigid observer may be identical to a more expressive one.

Population-based, gradient-free optimization circumvents backpropagation through non-differentiable spike dynamics by estimating gradients. However, with finite populations, high variance of these estimates can induce harmful and overly aggressive update steps. Inspired by trust-region methods in reinforcement learning that constrain policy updates in distribution space, we propose \\textbf{Signal-Adaptive Trust Regions (SATR)}, a distributional update rule that constrains relative change by bounding KL divergence normalized by an estimated signal energy. SATR automatically expands the trust region under strong signals and contracts it when updates are noise-dominated. We instantiate SATR for Bernoulli connectivity distributions, which have shown strong empirical performance for RSNN optimization. Across a suite of high-dimensional continuous-control benchmarks, SATR improves stability under limited populations and reaches competitive returns against strong baselines including PPO-LSTM. In addition, to make SATR practical at scale, we introduce a bitset implementation for binary spiking and binary weights, substantially reducing wall-clock training time and enabling fast RSNN policy search."}

We establish a gradient-based theoretical framework to explain catastrophic forgetting. We first prove that strongly negative gradient similarity is a fundamental cause of forgetting. We then use gradient similarity to identify two types of neurons: conflicting neurons that induce forgetting and account for 50%-75% of neurons, and collaborative neurons that mitigate forgetting and account for 25%-50%. Based on this analysis, we propose a knowledge injection method, Collaborative Neural Learning (CNL). By freezing conflicting neurons and updating only collaborative neurons, CNL theoretically eliminates catastrophic forgetting under an infinitesimal learning rate eta and an exactly known mastered set. Experiments on five LLMs, four datasets, and four optimizers show that CNL achieves zero forgetting in in-set settings and reduces forgetting by 59.1%-81.7% in out-of-set settings."}

Our approach, CORDS (Continuous Representations of Discrete Structures), provides an invertible mapping that transforms a set of spatial objects into continuous fields: a density field that encodes object locations and count, and a feature field that carries their attributes over the same support. Because the mapping is invertible, models operate entirely in field space while remaining exactly decodable to discrete sets. We evaluate CORDS across molecular generation and regression, object detection, simulation-based inference, and a mathematical task involving recovery of local maxima, demonstrating robust handling of unknown set sizes with competitive accuracy."}

For negation and converse, we prove that guaranteeing direction-agnostic first-order propagation necessitates a tensor factorization separating entity-pair context from relation content. However, for composition, we identify a fundamental obstruction. We show that composition reduces to conjunction, and prove that any conjunction well-defined on linear features must be bilinear. Since bilinearity is incompatible with negation, this forces the feature map to collapse.

To address this, we propose the Hessian Robust Quantization (HeRo Q) algorithm, which applies a lightweight, learnable rotation-compression matrix to the weight space prior to quantization. This joint framework reshapes the loss landscape by reducing the largest Hessian eigenvalue and reducing its max eigenvalue, thereby significantly enhancing robustness to quantization noise.

In contrast, we develop sampling-free bounds based on Rényi divergence and conditional composition. The former is facilitated by a dynamic programming formulation to efficiently compute the bounds. The latter complements it by offering stronger privacy guarantees for small $ε$, where Rényi divergence bounds inherently lead to an over-approximation.

Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) layers are a proven solution to scaling problems in natural language processing.

In this work, we introduce Seg-MoE, a sparse MoE design that routes and processes contiguous time-step segments rather than making independent expert decisions. Token segments allow each expert to model intra-segment interactions directly, naturally aligning with inherent temporal patterns. We integrate Seg-MoE layers into a time-series Transformer and evaluate it on multiple multivariate long-term forecasting benchmarks. Seg-MoE consistently achieves state-of-the-art forecasting accuracy across almost all prediction horizons, outperforming both dense Transformers and prior token-wise MoE models. Comprehensive ablation studies confirm that segment-level routing is the key factor driving these gains.

We identify that the prevailing Task-Centric Learning (TCL) paradigm, which scales exposure across disparate repositories, fails to address this limitation. In response, we propose Repository-Centric Learning (RCL), a paradigm shift that prioritizes vertical repository depth over horizontal task breadth, suggesting SLMs must internalize the \"physics\" of a target software environment through parametric knowledge acquisition, rather than attempting to recover it via costly inference-time search. Following this new paradigm, we design a four-unit Repository-Centric Experience, transforming static codebases into interactive learning signals, to train SWE-Spot-4B, a family of highly compact models built as repo-specialized experts that breaks established scaling trends, outperforming open-weight models up to larger (e.g., CWM by Meta, Qwen3-Coder-30B) and surpassing/matching efficiency-focused commercial models (e.g., GPT-4.1-mini, GPT-5-nano) across multiple SWE tasks.

We introduce representation holonomy, a gauge-invariant statistic that measures this path dependence. Conceptually, holonomy quantifies the \"twist\" accumulated when features are parallel-transported around a small loop in input space: flat representations yield zero holonomy, while nonzero values reveal hidden curvature. Our estimator fixes gauge through global whitening, aligns neighborhoods using shared subspaces and rotation-only Procrustes, and embeds the result back to the full feature space. We prove invariance to orthogonal (and affine, post-whitening) transformations, establish a linear null for affine layers, and show that holonomy vanishes at small radii. Empirically, holonomy increases with loop radius, separates models that appear similar under CKA, and correlates with adversarial and corruption robustness. It also tracks training dynamics as features form and stabilize. Together, these results position representation holonomy as a practical and scalable diagnostic for probing the geometric structure of learned representations beyond pointwise similarity."}

We demonstrate the performance on satellite remote sensing, reconstructing MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) derived vegetation index fields across six globally distributed sites.

Nevertheless, policies trained by standard expected return maximization routinely collapse onto a small subset of outcomes, a phenomenon commonly attributed to insufficient exploration or weak regularization. We show that this explanation is incomplete: outcome level mode collapse is a structural consequence of the expected-return objective itself. Under idealized learning dynamics, the log-probability ratio between any two outcomes evolves linearly in their reward difference, implying exponential ratio divergence and inevitable collapse independent of the exploration strategy, entropy regularization, or optimization algorithm. We identify the source of this pathology as the probability multiplier inside the expectation and propose a minimal correction: inverse probability scaling, which removes outcome-frequency amplification from the learning signal, fundamentally changes the learning dynamics, and provably yields reward-proportional terminal distributions, preventing collapse in multimodal settings. We instantiate this principle in Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) as a drop-in modification, IPS-GRPO, requiring no auxiliary models or architectural changes. Across different reasoning and molecular generation tasks, IPS-GRPO consistently reduces outcome-level mode collapse while matching or exceeding baseline performance, suggesting that correcting the objective rather than adding exploration heuristics is key to reliable multimodal policy optimization."}

However, existing approaches often suffer from limited generalization to unseen flow conditions and typically require retraining when applied to new scenarios. In this paper, we present LLM4Fluid, a spatio-temporal prediction framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) as generalizable neural solvers for fluid dynamics. The framework first compresses high-dimensional flow fields into a compact latent space via reduced-order modeling enhanced with a physics-informed disentanglement mechanism, effectively mitigating spatial feature entanglement while preserving essential flow structures. A pretrained LLM then serves as a temporal processor, autoregressively predicting the dynamics of physical sequences with time series prompts. To bridge the modality gap between prompts and physical sequences, which can otherwise degrade prediction accuracy, we propose a dedicated modality alignment strategy that resolves representational mismatch and stabilizes long-term prediction. Extensive experiments across diverse flow scenarios demonstrate that LLM4Fluid functions as a robust and generalizable neural solver without retraining, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy while exhibiting powerful zero-shot and in-context learning capabilities.

Starting from the theoretical insights, we then develop novel variants of local-SSL algorithms to approximate global BP-SSL in deep non-linear convolutional neural networks. Variants that improve the similarity between gradient updates of local-SSL with those of global BP-SSL also show better performance on image datasets (CIFAR-10, STL-10, and Tiny ImageNet).

Moreover, the lack of hyperparameter transparency in open-source fine-tuned models makes it difficult to predict merged-model performance, leaving practitioners without guidance on how to fine-tune merge-friendly experts.

Across orderings, training follows a shared sequence of latent phases, while curricula mainly change within-phase data exposure. In smaller models (up to 160M parameters), Random ordering exhibits higher gradient noise and stronger late-training output-head spectral saturation, alongside lower final accuracy; curricula reduce both effects at matched compute. At larger scales, saturation differences are smaller and curriculum gains shrink.

Specifically, if one can somehow identify a one-dimensional representation corresponding to a high-level concept, the linear representation hypothesis enables linear operations on this concept vector within the forget-representation space. Under this view, we hypothesize that, beyond forgetting, machine unlearning elicits controllable side behaviors and stronger side capabilities corresponding to the high-level concept. Our hypothesis is empirically validated across a wide range of tasks, including behavioral control (e.g., controlling unlearned models' truth, sentiment, and refusal) and capability enhancement (e.g., improving unlearned models' in-context learning capability).

A wide range of generative tasks is formulated to address these issues, including synthetic data generation, missing data imputation, and super-resolution. Despite the success of machine learning models on these tasks, dedicated models need to be designed and trained for each task, leading to redundancy and inefficiency. In this paper, by recognizing the powerful modeling capability of flow matching models, we propose a new approach to unify diverse smart meter data generative tasks with a single model trained for conditional generation. The proposed flow matching models are trained to generate challenging, high-dimensional time series data, specifically monthly smart meter data at a 15 min resolution. By viewing different generative tasks as distinct forms of partial data observations and injecting them into the generation process, we unify tasks such as imputation and super-resolution with a single model, eliminating the need for re-training. The data generated by our model not only are consistent with the given observations but also remain realistic, showing better performance against interpolation and other machine learning based baselines dedicated to the tasks."}

While predicting the future state introduces bias, conditioning the IDM on the prediction can significantly reduce variance. We establish conditions on the state predictor bias for PIDM to achieve lower prediction error and higher sample efficiency than BC, with the gap widening when additional data sources are available. We validate the theoretical insights empirically in 2D navigation tasks, where BC requires up to five times (three times on average) more demonstrations than PIDM to reach comparable performance; and in a complex 3D environment in a modern video game with high-dimensional visual inputs and stochastic transitions, where BC requires over 66\\% more samples than PIDM."}

For matrix-valued queries, however, we establish a sharp negative result: in the noise-free setting, the mechanism is not DP, and we demonstrate its vulnerability by implementing a near perfect membership inference attack (AUC $> 0.99$). We then analyze a noisy variant and prove privacy amplification due to randomness and low rank projection, in both large- and small-rank regimes, yielding stronger privacy guarantees than additive noise alone. Finally, we show that LoRA-style updates are an instance of the matrix-valued mechanism, implying that LoRA is not inherently private despite its built-in randomness, but that low-rank fine-tuning can be more private than full fine-tuning at the same noise level. Preliminary experiments suggest that tighter accounting enables lower noise and improved accuracy in practice."}

We perform a mechanistic analysis on a trained PFN that identifies attention latent output as the key intermediary, linking observed function data to spectral structure. Building on this insight, we propose decoder architectures that map PFN latents to explicit spectral density estimates and corresponding stationary kernels via Bochner's theorem. We study this pipeline in both single-realization and multi-realization regimes, contextualizing theoretical limits on spectral identifiability and proving consistency when multiple function samples are available. Empirically, the proposed decoders recover complex multi-peak spectral mixtures and produce explicit kernels that support Gaussian process regression with accuracy comparable to PFNs and optimization-based baselines, while requiring only a single forward pass. This yields orders-of-magnitude reductions in inference time compared to optimization-based baselines."}

As a result, a single MVM requires many compute cycles, and weights cannot be efficiently stored in a single crossbar cell.

The biggest challenge is the massive search space, that makes it difficult to find good quantization parameters. This is why we introduce a reinforcement learning-based strategy to find suitable quantization configurations that balance latency and accuracy. In the best case, our approach achieves up to a 2.48x speedup over existing state-of-the-art solutions, with an accuracy loss of only 0.086 %."}

We show that this choice is closely tied to a structural property that we refer to as \\textit{gradient scale invariance}. We formalize this notion and prove that Adam becomes gradient scale invariant of first order if and only if $β_{1}=β_{2}$. This perspective places the balanced regime of Adam in direct alignment with the design principles underlying several recent optimizers that explicitly enforce scale-robust updates. The theory is supported by experiments across vision and language tasks, and across different architectural families, in which rescaling the gradient has a markedly smoother effect on the update when $β_{1}=β_{2}$. Overall, our results offer a coherent explanation for an open question in the behavior of Adam and provide a simple principle that helps guide the design of future optimizers."}

Within this framework, a pre-trained classical neural network serves as a frozen feature block, while a VQC acts as a trainable adaptive module that operates on structured representations rather than raw inputs.

Experiments across multiple tasks show that LORAUTER consistently outperforms baseline routing approaches, matching Oracle performance (101.2%) when task-aligned adapters exist and achieving state-of-the-art results on unseen tasks (+5.2 points). We further demonstrate the robustness of LORAUTER to very large, noisy adapter pools by scaling it to over 1500 adapters."}

However, many existing approaches either rely on restrictive parametric assumptions or lack valid uncertainty quantification when flexible machine learning methods are used. In this paper, we propose a nonparametric statistical framework, DMLEval, for comparing and ranking LLMs from preference data using debiased machine learning (DML). For this, we introduce generalized average ranking scores (GARS), which generalize commonly used ranking models, including the Bradley-Terry model or PageRank/ Rank centrality, with complex human responses such as ties. DMLEval comes with the following advantages: (i) It produces statistically efficient estimates of GARS ranking scores. (ii) It naturally allows the incorporation of black-box machine learning methods for estimation. (iii) It can be combined with pre-trained LLM evaluators (e.g., using LLM-as-a-judge). (iv) It suggests optimal policies for collecting preference data under budget constraints. We demonstrate these advantages both theoretically and empirically using both synthetic and real-world preference datasets. In summary, our framework provides practitioners with powerful, state-of-the-art methods for comparing or ranking LLMs."}

In widely used attention implementations such as FlashAttention-3, the deterministic backward pass can incur up to a 37.9% throughput reduction relative to its non-deterministic counterpart, primarily because gradient accumulation operations must be serialized to guarantee numerical consistency. This performance loss stems from suboptimal scheduling of compute and gradient-reduction phases, leading to significant hardware underutilization.\n  To address this challenge, we formulate the backward pass of deterministic attention as a scheduling problem on a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) and derive schedules that minimize the critical path length. Building on this formulation, we present DASH (Deterministic Attention Scheduling for High-Throughput), which encapsulates two complementary scheduling strategies: (i) Descending Q-Tile Iteration, a reversed query-block traversal that shrinks pipeline stalls in causal attention, and (ii) Shift Scheduling, a theoretically optimal schedule within our DAG model that reduces pipeline stalls for both full and causal masks.\n  Our empirical evaluations on NVIDIA H800 GPUs demonstrate that DASH narrows the performance gap of deterministic attention. The proposed strategies improve the throughput of the attention backward pass by up to 1.28$\\times$ compared to the baseline, significantly advancing the efficiency of reproducible LLM training.\n  Our code is open-sourced at https://github.com/SJTU-Liquid/deterministic-FA3."}

Active learning strategies are used for scalar quantities to overcome this challenges and different so-called infill criteria exists and are commonly employed in several scenarios. Even though needed in various field an extension of active learning strategies towards field predictions is still lacking or limited to very specific scenarios and/or model types. In this paper we propose an active learning strategy for machine learning models that are capable if predicting field which is agnostic to the model architecture itself. For doing so, we combine a well-established Gaussian process model for a scalar reference value and simultaneously aim at reducing the epistemic model error and the difference between scalar and field predictions. Different specific forms of the above-mentioned approach are introduced and compared to each other as well as only scalar-valued based infill.

We address these limitations with MoHETS, an encoder-only Transformer that integrates sparse Mixture-of-Heterogeneous-Experts (MoHE) layers. MoHE routes temporal patches to a small subset of expert networks, combining a shared depthwise-convolution expert for sequence-level continuity with routed Fourier-based experts for patch-level periodic structures. MoHETS further improves robustness to non-stationary dynamics by incorporating exogenous information via cross-attention over covariate patch embeddings.

To address this gap, we study the structural complexity of code, which captures control flow and compositional structure that may shape how models internalise multi-step reasoning during fine-tuning. We examine two complementary settings: solution-driven complexity, where complexity varies across multiple solutions to the same problem, and problem-driven complexity, where complexity reflects variation in the underlying tasks. Using cyclomatic complexity and logical lines of code to construct controlled fine-tuning datasets, we evaluate a range of open-weight LLMs on diverse reasoning benchmarks. Our findings show that although code can improve reasoning, structural properties strongly determine its usefulness. In 83% of experiments, restricting fine-tuning data to a specific structural complexity range outperforms training on structurally diverse code, pointing to a data-centric path for improving reasoning beyond scaling."}

As a result, naively reusing source Bellman updates introduces systematic bias and invalidates regret guarantees.\n  We identify one-step Bellman alignment as the correct abstraction for transfer in online RL and propose re-weighted targeting (RWT), an operator-level correction that retargets continuation values and compensates for transition mismatch via a change of measure. RWT reduces task mismatch to a fixed one-step correction and enables statistically sound reuse of source data.\n  This alignment yields a two-stage RWT $Q$-learning framework that separates variance reduction from bias correction. Under RKHS function approximation, we establish regret bounds that scale with the complexity of the task shift rather than the target MDP.

The best-performing TDA methods exploits gradients to define an influence function. To overcome the scalability challenge arising from gradient computation, the most popular strategy is random projection (e.g., TRAK, LoGRA). However, this still faces two bottlenecks when scaling to large training sets and high-quality attribution: \\emph{(i)} storing and loading projected per-example gradients for all $N$ training examples, where query latency is dominated by I/O; and \\emph{(ii)} forming the $D \\times D$ inverse Hessian approximation, which costs $O(D^2)$ memory. Both bottlenecks scale with the projection dimension $D$, yet increasing $D$ is necessary for attribution quality -- creating a quality-scalability tradeoff. We introduce \\textbf{LoRIF (Low-Rank Influence Functions)}, which exploits low-rank structures of gradient to address both bottlenecks. First, we store rank-$c$ factors of the projected per-example gradients rather than full matrices, reducing storage and query-time I/O from $O(D)$ to $O(c\\sqrt{D})$ per layer per sample. Second, we use truncated SVD with the Woodbury identity to approximate the Hessian term in an $r$-dimensional subspace, reducing memory from $O(D^2)$ to $O(Dr)$.

Among these, GPT-based molecular language models (MLM) have shown strong molecular design performance by learning chemical syntax and semantics from large-scale data. However, existing MLMs face two fundamental limitations: they inadequately capture the graph-structured nature of molecules when formulated as next-token prediction problems, and they typically lack explicit mechanisms for target-aware generation. Here, we propose SoftMol, a unified framework that co-designs molecular representation, model architecture, and search strategy for target-aware molecular generation. SoftMol introduces soft fragments, a rule-free block representation of SMILES that enables diffusion-native modeling, and develops SoftBD, the first block-diffusion molecular language model that combines local bidirectional diffusion with autoregressive generation under molecular structural constraints. To favor generated molecules with high drug-likeness and synthetic accessibility, SoftBD is trained on a carefully curated dataset named ZINC-Curated. SoftMol further integrates a gated Monte Carlo tree search to assemble fragments in a target-aware manner. Experimental results show that, compared with current state-of-the-art models, SoftMol achieves 100% chemical validity, improves binding affinity by 9.7%, yields a 2-3x increase in molecular diversity, and delivers a 6.6x speedup in inference efficiency.

Existing LLM-based reasoning methods prioritize contextual over structural relations, struggling to extract relevant subgraphs from dynamic graphs.

To address this problem, we propose IGETR (Integration of Graph and Editing-enhanced Temporal Reasoning), a hybrid reasoning framework that combines the structured temporal modeling capabilities of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) with the contextual understanding of LLMs. IGETR operates through a three-stage pipeline. The first stage aims to ground the reasoning process in the actual data by identifying structurally and temporally coherent candidate paths through a temporal GNN, ensuring that inference starts from reliable graph-based evidence. The second stage introduces LLM-guided path editing to address logical and semantic inconsistencies, leveraging external knowledge to refine and enhance the initial paths. The final stage focuses on integrating the refined reasoning paths to produce predictions that are both accurate and interpretable. Experiments on standard TKG benchmarks show that IGETR achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming strong baselines with relative improvements of up to 5.6% on Hits@1 and 8.1% on Hits@3 on the challenging ICEWS datasets.

While it is widely known that this makes it less effective for applications involving medical images, the extent to which the metric fails to capture meaningful differences in image characteristics is not obviously known. Here, we use Monte Carlo dropout to compute the predictive variance in the FID as well as a supplemental estimate of the predictive variance in the feature embedding model's latent representations.

While physics-based guidance can correct this, it faces two computational bottlenecks: expensive quantum-chemical evaluations (e.g., DFT) and the need to repeat such queries at every sampling step. We present Elign, a post-training framework that amortizes both costs. First, we replace expensive DFT evaluations with a faster, pretrained foundational machine-learning force field (MLFF) to provide physical signals. Second, we eliminate repeated run-time queries by shifting physical steering to the training phase. To achieve the second amortization, we formulate reverse diffusion as a reinforcement learning problem and introduce Force--Energy Disentangled Group Relative Policy Optimization (FED-GRPO) to fine-tune the denoising policy. FED-GRPO includes a potential-based energy reward and a force-based stability reward, which are optimized and group-normalized independently. Experiments show that Elign generates conformations with lower gold-standard DFT energies and forces, while improving stability. Crucially, inference remains as fast as unguided sampling, since no energy evaluations are required during generation."}

Using this framework, we derive a general information-gathering cost based on Massey's directed information that assumes only Markov dynamics with additive noise and is otherwise agnostic to modeling choices.

In this paper, we begin by theoretically establishing the generalization bound for IDG, highlighting the role of posterior discrepancy and decision margin. This bound motivates us to focus on directly steering decision boundaries, marking a clear departure from existing methods. Subsequently, we technically propose a novel Negative-Dominant Contrastive Learning (NDCL) for IDG to enhance discriminability while enforce posterior consistency across domains. Specifically, inter-class decision-boundary separation is enhanced by placing greater emphasis on negatives as the primary signal in our contrastive learning, naturally amplifying gradient signals for minority classes to avoid the decision boundary being biased toward majority classes. Meanwhile, intra-class compactness is encouraged through a re-weighted cross-entropy strategy, and posterior consistency across domains is enforced through a prediction-central alignment strategy. Finally, rigorous yet challenging experiments on benchmarks validate the effectiveness of our NDCL. The code is available at https://github.com/Alrash/NDCL."}

At each token, STARS collects the hidden activations of concurrent generation runs and optimizes multiple additive steering directions jointly on the Stiefel manifold. STARS maximizes the geometric volume of the steered activations, while the Stiefel manifold induces orthogonality of the steering interventions. This formulation explicitly promotes divergent activation vectors of concurrent generation runs, and implicitly promotes divergent generation trajectories. This manifold optimization formulation can be solved using a Riemannian gradient descent algorithm with convergence guarantees, but this algorithm is too time-consuming for real-time inference. To guarantee low latency, we further design a lightweight one-step update with an aggressive, closed-form stepsize. For test case generation and scientific discovery benchmarks, STARS consistently outperforms standard sampling methods, achieving greater diversity without sacrificing qualitative performance."}

Selecting high-quality, diverse training sets for large language models (LLMs) is a difficult task, due to the lack of cheap and reliable quality metrics. While querying existing LLMs for document quality is common, this is not scalable to the large number (billions) of documents used in training. Instead, practitioners often use classifiers trained on sparse quality signals. In this paper, we propose a text-embedding-based hierarchical clustering approach that adaptively selects the documents to be evaluated by the LLM to estimate cluster quality. We prove that our method is query efficient: under the assumption that the hierarchical clustering contains a subtree such that each leaf cluster in the tree is pure enough (i.e., it mostly contains either only good or only bad documents), with high probability, the method can correctly predict the quality of each document after querying a small number of documents. The number of such documents is proportional to the size of the smallest subtree with (almost) pure leaves, without the algorithm knowing this subtree in advance. Furthermore, in a comprehensive experimental study, we demonstrate the benefits of our algorithm compared to other classifier-based filtering methods."}

In recent applications, the EIP also arises in full waveform inversion (FWI) and inverse imaging with unknown priors. We propose non-iterative inference-time methods that construct posterior samplers based on a new class of conditional generative models, which we call ensemble inverse generative models. For the posterior modeling, these models additionally use the ensemble information contained in the observation set on top of single measurements. Unlike existing methods, our proposed methods avoid explicit and iterative use of the forward model at inference time via training across several sets of truth-observation pairs that are consistent with the same forward model, but originate from a wide range of priors. We demonstrate that this training procedure implicitly encodes the likelihood model. The use of ensemble information helps posterior inference and enables generalization to unseen priors.

Motivated by the observation that each parameter exhibits different importance for forgetting versus retention, we propose a per-parameter task arithmetic (PerTA) mechanism to rescale the TV, allowing per-parameter adjustment. These weights quantify the relative importance of each parameter for forgetting versus retention, estimated via gradients (i.e., PerTA-grad) or the diagonal Fisher information approximation (i.e., PerTA-fisher). Moreover, we discuss the effectiveness of PerTA, extend it to a more general form, and provide further analysis. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PerTA consistently improves upon standard TV, and in many cases surpasses widely used training-based unlearning methods in both forgetting effectiveness and overall model utility.

Existing distributional distance metrics conflate these factors, leading to measures that are not informative of the true extent of fusion between data groups. We introduce Cross-Fusion Distance (CFD), a principled measure that isolates fusion-altering geometry while remaining robust to fusion-preserving variations, with linear computational complexity.

However, these models often yield overconfident, uncalibrated predictions. The standard approach to quantifying epistemic uncertainty, training an ensemble of independent models, incurs prohibitive computational costs that scale linearly with ensemble size, making it impractical for large foundation models. We propose Singular Value Ensemble (SVE), a parameter-efficient implicit ensemble method that builds on a simple, but powerful core assumption: namely, that the singular vectors of the weight matrices constitute meaningful subspaces of the model's knowledge. Pretrained foundation models encode rich, transferable information in their weight matrices. If the singular vectors are indeed meaningful (orthogonal) \"knowledge directions\". To obtain a model ensemble, we modulate only how strongly each direction contributes to the output. Rather than learning entirely new parameters, we freeze the singular vectors and only train per-member singular values that rescale the contribution of each direction in that shared knowledge basis. Ensemble diversity emerges naturally as stochastic initialization and random sampling of mini-batches during joint training cause different members to converge to different combinations of the same underlying knowledge. SVE achieves uncertainty quantification comparable to explicit deep ensembles while increasing the parameter count of the base model by less than 1%, making principled uncertainty estimation accessible in resource-constrained settings. We validate SVE on NLP and vision tasks with various different backbones and show that it improves calibration while maintaining predictive accuracy."}

However, preference optimization for language models is particularly challenging because token-space similarity does not imply semantic or behavioral similarity. To address this challenge, we leverage latent-space regularization for language model preference optimization. We introduce GANPO, which achieves latent-space regularization by penalizing divergence between the internal representations of a policy model and a reference model. Given that latent representations are not associated with explicit probability densities, we adopt an adversarial approach inspired by GANs to minimize latent-space divergence. We integrate GANPO as a regularizer into existing offline preference optimization objectives. Experiments across multiple model architectures and tasks show consistent improvements from latent-space regularization. Further, by comparing GANPO-induced inferential biases with those from token-level regularization, we find that GANPO provides more robust structural feedback under distributional shift and noise while maintaining comparable downstream performance with minor computational overhead."}

Building on this perspective, we introduce GeoNorm, a novel method that replaces standard normalization with geodesic updates on the manifold. Furthermore, analogous to learning rate schedules, we propose a layer-wise update decay for the FFN and attention components. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that GeoNorm consistently outperforms existing normalization methods in Transformer models. Crucially, GeoNorm can be seamlessly integrated into standard Transformer architectures, achieving performance improvements with negligible additional computational cost."}

This inefficiency stems from the fact that it focuses on tail-end performance and overlooks many sampled trajectories. We address this problem by augmenting CVaR with an expected quantile term. Quantile optimization admits a dynamic programming formulation that leverages all sampled data, thus improves sample efficiency. This does not alter the CVaR objective since CVaR corresponds to the expectation of quantile over the tail. Empirical results in domains with verifiable risk-averse behavior show that our algorithm within the Markovian policy class substantially improves upon CVaR-PG and consistently outperforms other existing methods."}

Reconstructing graphs from partial observations remains a key challenge; classical embedding methods often lack global consistency, while modern generative models struggle to incorporate structural priors. PIFM bridges this gap by integrating embedding-based priors with continuous-time flow matching. Grounded in a permutation equivariant version of the distortion-perception theory, our method first uses a prior, such as graphons or GraphSAGE/node2vec, to form an informed initial estimate of the adjacency matrix based on local information. It then applies rectified flow matching to refine this estimate, transporting it toward the true distribution of clean graphs and learning a global coupling. Experiments on different datasets demonstrate that PIFM consistently enhances classical embeddings, outperforming them and state-of-the-art generative baselines in reconstruction accuracy."}

Standard pretraining optimizes a fixed proxy objective (e.g., next-token prediction), which can misallocate compute away from downstream capabilities of interest. We introduce V-Pretraining: a value-based, modality-agnostic method for controlled continued pretraining in which a lightweight task designer reshapes the pretraining task to maximize the value of each gradient step. For example, consider self-supervised learning (SSL) with sample augmentation. The V-Pretraining task designer selects pretraining tasks (e.g., augmentations) for which the pretraining loss gradient is aligned with a gradient computed over a downstream task (e.g., image segmentation). This helps steer pretraining towards relevant downstream capabilities. Notably, the pretrained model is never updated on downstream task labels; they are used only to shape the pretraining task. Under matched learner update budgets, V-Pretraining of 0.5B--7B language models improves reasoning (GSM8K test Pass@1) by up to 18% relative over standard next-token prediction using only 12% of GSM8K training examples as feedback. In vision SSL, we improve the state-of-the-art results on ADE20K by up to 1.07 mIoU and reduce NYUv2 RMSE while improving ImageNet linear accuracy, and we provide pilot evidence of improved token efficiency in continued pretraining."}

Unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) provide flexible in situ measurements, but individual platforms sample wind only along their flight trajectories, limiting full wind-field recovery. This study presents a framework for reconstructing four-dimensional atmospheric wind fields using measurements obtained from a coordinated UAS swarm. A synthetic turbulence environment and high-fidelity multirotor simulation are used to generate training and evaluation data. Local wind components are estimated from UAS dynamics using a bidirectional long short-term memory network (Bi-LSTM) and assimilated into a physics-informed neural network (PINN) to reconstruct a continuous wind field in space and time. For local wind estimation, the bidirectional LSTM achieves root-mean-square errors (RMSE) of 0.064 and 0.062 m/s for the north and east components in low-wind conditions, increasing to 0.122 to 0.129 m/s under moderate winds and 0.271 to 0.273 m/s in high-wind conditions, while the vertical component exhibits higher error, with RMSE values of 0.029 to 0.091 m/s. The physics-informed reconstruction recovers the dominant spatial and temporal structure of the wind field up to 1000 m altitude while preserving mean flow direction and vertical shear. Under moderate wind conditions, the reconstructed mean wind field achieves an overall RMSE between 0.118 and 0.154 m/s across evaluated UAS configurations, with the lowest error obtained using a five-UAS swarm. These results demonstrate that coordinated UAS measurements enable accurate and scalable four-dimensional wind-field reconstruction without dedicated wind sensors or fixed infrastructure."}

To overcome this constraint, we introduce a framework to learn Hamiltonian Flow Maps by predicting the mean phase-space evolution over a chosen time span $Δt$, enabling stable large-timestep updates far beyond the stability limits of classical integrators. To this end, we impose a Mean Flow consistency condition for time-averaged Hamiltonian dynamics. Unlike prior approaches, this allows training on independent phase-space samples without access to future states, avoiding expensive trajectory generation. Validated across diverse Hamiltonian systems, our method in particular improves upon molecular dynamics simulations using machine-learned force fields (MLFF). Our models maintain comparable training and inference cost, but support significantly larger integration timesteps while trained directly on widely-available trajectory-free MLFF datasets."}

In many applications, historical data from related optimization tasks is available, creating an opportunity for meta-learning to accelerate the optimization. Bayesian optimization, as a promising technique for black-box optimization, has been extended to meta-learning and multi-objective optimization independently, but methods that simultaneously address both settings - meta-learned priors for multi-objective Bayesian optimization - remain largely unexplored. We propose SMOG, a scalable and modular meta-learning model based on a multi-output Gaussian process that explicitly learns correlations between objectives. SMOG builds a structured joint Gaussian process prior across meta- and target tasks and, after conditioning on metadata, yields a closed-form target-task prior augmented by a flexible residual multi-output kernel. This construction propagates metadata uncertainty into the target surrogate in a principled way. SMOG supports hierarchical, parallel training: meta-task Gaussian processes are fit once and then cached, achieving linear scaling with the number of meta-tasks. The resulting surrogate integrates seamlessly with standard multi-objective Bayesian optimization acquisition functions."}

Small Language Models (SLMs) offer dramatic cost savings yet lag substantially in accuracy. Existing approaches - routing and cascading - treat the LLM as an all-or-nothing resource: either the query bypasses the LLM entirely, or the LLM generates a complete response at full cost. We introduce LLM Shepherding, a framework that requests only a short prefix (a hint) from the LLM and provides it to SLM. This simple mechanism is surprisingly effective for math and coding tasks: even hints comprising 10-30% of the full LLM response improve SLM accuracy significantly. Shepherding generalizes both routing and cascading, and it achieves lower cost under oracle decision-making. We develop a two-stage predictor that jointly determines whether a hint is needed and how many tokens to request. On the widely-used mathematical reasoning (GSM8K, CNK12) and code generation (HumanEval, MBPP) benchmarks, Shepherding reduces costs by 42-94% relative to LLM-only inference. Compared to state-of-the-art routing and cascading baselines, shepherding delivers up to 2.8x cost reduction while matching accuracy. To our knowledge, this is the first work to exploit token-level budget control for SLM-LLM collaboration."}

A detector that flags a violation at step 8 enables intervention; one that reports it at step 48 provides only forensic value. This distinction is critical, yet current benchmarks cannot measure it. We introduce StepShield, the first benchmark to evaluate when violations are detected, not just whether. StepShield contains 9,213 code agent trajectories, including 1,278 meticulously annotated training pairs and a 7,935-trajectory test set with a realistic 8.1% rogue rate. Rogue behaviors are grounded in real-world security incidents across six categories. We propose three novel temporal metrics: Early Intervention Rate (EIR), Intervention Gap, and Tokens Saved. Surprisingly, our evaluation reveals that an LLM-based judge achieves 59% EIR while a static analyzer achieves only 26%, a 2.3x performance gap that is entirely invisible to standard accuracy metrics. We further show that early detection has direct economic benefits: our cascaded HybridGuard detector reduces monitoring costs by 75% and projects to $108M in cumulative savings over five years at enterprise scale. By shifting the focus of evaluation from whether to when, StepShield provides a new foundation for building safer and more economically viable AI agents.

PRISM combines adaptive polynomial approximation with randomized sketching: at each iteration, it fits a polynomial surrogate to the current spectrum via a sketched least-squares problem, adapting to the instance at hand with minimal overhead. We apply PRISM to accelerate Newton-Schulz-like iterations for matrix square roots and orthogonalization, which are core primitives in machine learning. Unlike prior methods, PRISM requires no explicit spectral bounds or singular value estimates; and it adapts automatically to the evolving spectrum.

State-of-the-art research still focuses on efficiently executing enormous numbers of multiply-accumulate (MAC) operations. However, CPUs themselves are not good at executing such mathematical operations on a large scale, since they are more suited to execute control flow logic, i.e., computer algorithms. To enhance the computation efficiency of neural networks on CPUs, in this paper, we propose to convert them into logic flows for execution. Specifically, neural networks are first converted into equivalent decision trees, from which decision paths with constant leaves are then selected and compressed into logic flows. Such logic flows consist of if and else structures and a reduced number of MAC operations. Experimental results demonstrate that the latency can be reduced by up to 14.9 % on a simulated RISC-V CPU without any accuracy degradation.\n  The code is open source at https://github.com/TUDa-HWAI/NN2Logic"}
