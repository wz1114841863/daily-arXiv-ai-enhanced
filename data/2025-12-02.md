TL;DR: 利用数值局部性压缩数据块，为强ECC释放存储空间，在不增加存储开销的情况下提升RTM缓存的可靠性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SRAM缓存面临可扩展性限制，RTM作为替代方案具有高密度和SRAM级性能，但存在可靠性挑战，特别是多比特错误问题。传统ECC要么无法容忍多比特错误，要么需要大量额外存储空间。

Method: 利用数值局部性压缩数据块，释放缓存块空间用于存储强ECC的冗余数据。大多数缓存块通过强ECC保护以容忍多比特错误，且无存储开销。

Result: 使用gem5全系统模拟器评估，该方案将缓存平均故障间隔时间提升11.3倍，硬件和性能开销均低于1%。

Conclusion: 提出的方案有效解决了RTM缓存的多比特错误可靠性问题，在极低开销下显著提升了系统可靠性，为RTM在末级缓存中的应用提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: SRAM-based cache memory faces several scalability limitations in deep nanoscale technologies, e.g., high leakage current, low cell stability, and low density. Emerging Non-Volatile Memory (NVM) technologies have received lots of attention in recent years, where Racetrack Memory (RTM) is among the most promising ones. RTM has the highest density among all NVMs and its access performance is comparable to SRAM technology. Therefore, RTM is a suitable alternative for SRAM in the Last-Level Caches (LLCs). Despite all its benefits, RTM confronts different reliability challenges due to the stochastic behavior of its storage element and highly error-prone data shifting, leading to a high probability of multiple-bit errors. Conventional Error-Correcting Codes (ECCs) are either incapable of tolerating multiple-bit errors or require a large amount of extra storage for check bits. This paper proposes taking advantage of value locality for compressing data blocks and freeing up a large fraction of cache blocks for storing data redundancy of strong ECCs. Utilizing the proposed scheme, a large majority of cache blocks are protected by strong ECCs to tolerate multiple-bit errors without any storage overhead. The evaluation using gem5 full-system simulator demonstrates that the proposed scheme enhances the mean-time-to-failure of the cache by an average of 11.3x with less than 1% hardware and performance overhead.

Conclusion: VeriPy成功降低了SDR工程师的硬件开发门槛，提供了高性能的硬件加速器生成方案，在保持代码简洁的同时实现了接近手工编码的性能。

Abstract: Software-defined radio (SDR) plays an important role in the communication field by providing a flexible and customized communication system for different purposes according to the needs. To enhance the performance of SDR applications, hardware accelerators have been widely deployed in recent years. In facing this obstacle, a necessity arises for a high-level synthesis (HLS) tool specifically designed for communication engineers without detailed hardware knowledge. To lower the barrier between SDR engineers and hardware development, this work proposed a Python-based HLS tool, VeriPy, which can generate both mainstream architecture for hardware accelerators in Verilog specifically for SDR designs including unrolled design and pipelined design, requiring no detailed digital hardware knowledge or Hardware Description Languages (HDL). Furthermore, VeriPy supports automatic testbench generation with random input stimulus, an extensible hardware library, performance and resource estimation, and offers strong optimisation potential at both the algorithmic and digital hardware levels. The generated hardware design by VeriPy can achieve up to 70% faster operating frequency compared to pragma-optimised Vivado HLS designs with a reasonably higher resource con-sumption while delivering comparable performance and resource consumption to hand-coded implementations. Regarding code complexity, VeriPy requires no pragmas, completely eliminating the need for low-level hardware knowledge. For straightforward algorithms, the input code length remains comparable to that of Vivado HLS.

### [3] [Architect in the Loop Agentic Hardware Design and Verification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00016)
*Mubarek Mohammed*

Main category: cs.AR

TL;DR: 提出基于智能代理的自动化处理器设计与验证方法，利用LLM分层分解设计、生成HDL和测试，结合工程师指导完成处理器设计验证流程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 硬件设计复杂度日益增加，现有AI自动化方法多局限于小型组件，缺乏完整的处理器设计自动化方案。需要利用分层模块化设计理念，开发端到端的处理器设计验证自动化方法。

Method: 采用智能代理架构，结合推理模型（如gemini-pro）和非推理模型（如gpt-5-mini），将处理器设计分解为子组件，生成HDL代码和cocotb测试，在工程师指导下进行调试和综合验证。

Result: 成功设计了两种处理器：类似LEGv8的处理器在DE-10 Lite FPGA上验证、综合并编程；类似RISC-V的32位处理器完成设计和验证。每个处理器约消耗百万推理tokens，成本效益高。

Conclusion: 该方法实现了可扩展的处理器设计自动化，成本效益高，无需专用硬件，未来可扩展到片上系统设计，为硬件设计验证提供了新的自动化途径。

Abstract: The ever increasing complexity of the hardware design process demands improved hardware design and verification methodologies. With the advent of generative AI various attempts have been made to automate parts of the design and verification process. Large language models (LLMs) as well as specialized models generate hdl and testbenches for small components, having a few leaf level components. However, there are only a few attempts to automate the entire processor design process. Hardware design demands hierarchical and modular design processes. We utilized this best practice systematically and effectively. We propose agentic automated processor design and verification with engineers in the loop. The agent with optional specification tries to break down the design into sub-components, generate HDL and cocotb tests, and verifies the components involving engineer guidance, especially during debugging and synthesis. We designed various digital systems using this approach. However, we selected two simple processors for demonstration purposes in this work. The first one is a LEGv8 like a simple processor verified, synthesized and programmed for the DE-10 Lite FPGA. The second one is a RISC-V like 32-bit processor designed and verified in similar manner and synthesized. However, it is not programmed into the DE-10 Lite. This process is accomplished usually using around a million inference tokens per processor, using a combination of reasoning (e.g gemini-pro) and non-reasoning models (eg. gpt-5-mini) based on the complexity of the task. This indicates that hardware design and verification experimentation can be done cost effectively without using any specialized hardware. The approach is scalable, we even attempted system-on-chip, which we want to experiment in our future work.

Abstract: Processing-in-Memory (PIM) has emerged as a promising computing paradigm to address the memory wall and the fundamental bottleneck of the von Neumann architecture by reducing costly data movement between memory and processing units. As with any engineering challenge, identifying the most effective solutions requires thorough exploration of diverse architectural proposals, device technologies, and application domains. In this context, simulation plays a critical role in enabling researchers to evaluate, compare, and refine PIM designs prior to fabrication. Over the past decade, a variety of PIM simulators have been introduced, spanning low-level device models, architectural frameworks, and application-oriented environments. These tools differ significantly in fidelity, scalability, supported memory/compute technologies, and benchmark compatibility. Understanding these trade-offs is essential for researchers to select appropriate simulators that accurately map and validate their research efforts. This chapter provides a comprehensive overview of PIM simulation methodologies and tools. We categorize simulators according to abstraction levels, design objectives, and evaluation metrics, highlighting representative examples. To improve accessibility, some content may appear in multiple contexts to guide readers with different backgrounds. We also survey benchmark suites commonly employed in PIM studies and discuss open challenges in simulation methodology, paving the way for more reliable, scalable, and efficient PIM modeling.

### [5] [Hardware-Aware DNN Compression for Homogeneous Edge Devices](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00017)
*Kunlong Zhang,Guiying Li,Ning Lu,Peng Yang,Ke Tang*

Main category: cs.AR

TL;DR: HDAP是一个针对同构边缘设备的DNN压缩框架，通过设备聚类和代理评估来优化压缩模型在所有设备上的平均性能，解决了设备性能差异带来的部署挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 同构边缘设备（相同型号）在部署后由于用户配置、环境条件、制造差异、电池退化等因素，实际性能会变得不同。现有的DNN压缩方法未考虑这种情况，无法保证在所有同构设备上都有良好的压缩效果。

Method: 提出HDAP框架：1）将大量同构设备聚类成几个设备簇，大幅减少需要评估的设备数量；2）使用基于代理的评估替代实时硬件评估；3）优化压缩模型在所有设备上的平均性能。

Result: 在多种设备类型（Jetson Xavier NX和Jetson Nano）和任务类型（图像分类、目标检测）上，HDAP相比现有方法实现了更低的平均延迟和竞争性准确率，显著加速（如ResNet50在1.0G FLOPs下达到2.86倍加速）。

Conclusion: HDAP为同构边缘设备提供了一种可扩展、高性能的DNN部署解决方案，能够有效处理设备性能差异问题，实现优化的平均性能。

Abstract: Deploying deep neural networks (DNNs) across homogeneous edge devices (the devices with the same SKU labeled by the manufacturer) often assumes identical performance among them. However, once a device model is widely deployed, the performance of each device becomes different after a period of running. This is caused by the differences in user configurations, environmental conditions, manufacturing variances, battery degradation, etc. Existing DNN compression methods have not taken this scenario into consideration and can not guarantee good compression results in all homogeneous edge devices. To address this, we propose Homogeneous-Device Aware Pruning (HDAP), a hardware-aware DNN compression framework explicitly designed for homogeneous edge devices, aiming to achieve optimal average performance of the compressed model across all devices. To deal with the difficulty of time-consuming hardware-aware evaluations for thousands or millions of homogeneous edge devices, HDAP partitions all the devices into several device clusters, which can dramatically reduce the number of devices to evaluate and use the surrogate-based evaluation instead of hardware evaluation in real-time. Extensive experiments on multiple device types (Jetson Xavier NX and Jetson Nano) and task types (image classification with ResNet50, MobileNetV1, ResNet56, VGG16; object detection with YOLOv8n) demonstrate that HDAP consistently achieves lower average latency and competitive accuracy compared to state-of-the-art methods, with significant speedups (e.g., 2.86$\times$ on ResNet50 at 1.0G FLOPs). HDAP offers an effective solution for scalable, high-performance DNN deployment methods for homogeneous edge devices.

Abstract: Code generation has emerged as a critical research area at the intersection of Software Engineering (SE) and Artificial Intelligence (AI), attracting significant attention from both academia and industry. Within this broader landscape, Verilog, as a representative hardware description language (HDL), plays a fundamental role in digital circuit design and verification, making its automated generation particularly significant for Electronic Design Automation (EDA). Consequently, recent research has increasingly focused on applying Large Language Models (LLMs) to Verilog code generation, particularly at the Register Transfer Level (RTL), exploring how these AI-driven techniques can be effectively integrated into hardware design workflows. Despite substantial research efforts have explored LLM applications in this domain, a comprehensive survey synthesizing these developments remains absent from the literature. This review fill addresses this gap by providing a systematic literature review of LLM-based methods for Verilog code generation, examining their effectiveness, limitations, and potential for advancing automated hardware design. The review encompasses research work from conferences and journals in the fields of SE, AI, and EDA, encompassing 70 papers published on venues, along with 32 high-quality preprint papers, bringing the total to 102 papers. By answering four key research questions, we aim to (1) identify the LLMs used for Verilog generation, (2) examine the datasets and metrics employed in evaluation, (3) categorize the techniques proposed for Verilog generation, and (4) analyze LLM alignment approaches for Verilog generation. Based on our findings, we have identified a series of limitations of existing studies. Finally, we have outlined a roadmap highlighting potential opportunities for future research endeavors in LLM-assisted hardware design.

Abstract: This paper presents an in-memory computing (IMC) architecture developed on an 8x8 array of 8T SRAM cells. This architecture enables both multi-bit parallel Multiply-Accumulate (MAC) operations and standard memory processing through charge-sharing on dedicated read bit-lines. By leveraging the maturity of SRAM technology, this work introduces an 8T SRAM-based IMC architecture that decouples read and write paths, thereby overcoming the reliability limitations of prior 6T SRAM designs. A novel analog-to-digital decoding scheme converts the MAC voltage output into digital counts, which are subsequently interpreted to realize fundamental logic functions including AND/NAND, NOR/OR, XOR/XNOR, and 1-bit addition within the same array. Simulated in a 90 nm CMOS process at 1.8 V supply voltage, the proposed design achieves 8-bit MAC and logical operations at a frequency of 142.85 MHz, with a latency of 0.7 ns and energy consumption of 56.56 fJ/bit per MAC operation and throughput of 15.8 M operations/s.

TL;DR: 使用神经网络预测相变存储器(PCM)的关键参数，包括写入延迟、能耗和耐久性，以优化PCM性能并提高其作为存储替代方案的可行性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着DRAM等晶体管存储技术接近可扩展性极限，需要探索替代存储方案。PCM因其可扩展性、快速访问速度和零泄漏功率而备受关注，但其耐久性有限且写入能耗高，阻碍了广泛应用。

Method: 提出使用神经网络模型，通过监测实时操作条件和设备特性，预测PCM的关键参数（写入延迟、能耗和耐久性），以优化写入设置并提高性能。

Result: 神经网络预测取得了显著成果：耐久性预测的MAPE为0.0073%，总写入延迟预测为0.23%，总写入能耗预测为4.92%。

Abstract: As transistor-based memory technologies like dynamic random access memory (DRAM) approach their scalability limits, the need to explore alternative storage solutions becomes increasingly urgent. Phase-change memory (PCM) has gained attention as a promising option due to its scalability, fast access speeds, and zero leakage power compared to conventional memory systems. However, despite these advantages, PCM faces several challenges that impede its broader adoption, particularly its limited lifespan due to material degradation during write operations, as well as the high energy demands of these processes. For PCM to become a viable storage alternative, enhancing its endurance and reducing the energy required for write operations are essential. This paper proposes the use of a neural network (NN) model to predict critical parameters such as write latency, energy consumption, and endurance by monitoring real-time operating conditions and device characteristics. These predictions are key to improving PCM performance and identifying optimal write settings, making PCM a more practical and efficient option for data storage in applications with frequent write operations. Our approach leads to significant improvements, with NN predictions achieving a Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) of 0.0073% for endurance, 0.23% for total write latency, and 4.92% for total write energy.

Abstract: Soft-core processors on resource-constrained FPGAs often suffer from low code density and reliance on proprietary toolchains. This paper details the design, implementation, and evaluation of a 32-bit dual-stack microprocessor architecture optimized for low-cost, resource-constrained Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs). Implemented on the Gowin GW1NR-9 (Tang Nano 9K), the processor utilizes an instruction set architecture (ISA) inspired from a subset of the WebAssembly (WASM) specification to achieve high code density. Unlike traditional soft-cores that often rely on proprietary vendor toolchains and opaque IP blocks, this design is synthesized and routed utilizing an open-source flow, providing transparency and portability. The architecture features a dual-stack model (Data and Return), executing directly from SPI Flash via an Execute-in-Place (XIP) mechanism to conserve scarce Block RAM on the intended target device. An analysis of the trade-offs involved in stack depth parametrization is presented, demonstrating that an 8-entry distributed RAM implementation provides a balance between logic resource utilization ($\sim 80\%$) and routing congestion. Furthermore, timing hazards in single-cycle stack operations are identified and resolved through a refined Finite State Machine (FSM) design. The system achieves a stable operating frequency of 27 MHz, limited by Flash latency, and successfully executes simple applications including a single and multi-digit infix calculator.

Abstract: In recent years, the increased interest and the growth in application domains of Artificial Intelligence (AI), and more specifically Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), has led to an extensive usage of domain specific DNN accelerator processors to improve the computational efficiency of DNN inference. However, like any digital circuit, these processors are prone to faults induced by radiation particles such as heavy ions, protons, etc., making their use in harsh radiation environments a challenge. This work presents an in-depth analysis of the impact of such faults on the computational pipeline of a Systolic Array based Deep Neural Network accelerator (SA-DNN accelerator) by means of a Register Transfer Level (RTL) Fault Injection (FI) simulation in order to improve the observability of each hardware block. From this analysis, we present the sensitivity to single bit faults of register groups in the pipeline for three different DNN workloads utilising two datasets, namely MNIST and CIFAR-10. These sensitivity figures are presented in terms of Fault Propagation Probability ($P(f_{non-crit})$) and False Classification Probability ($P(f_{crit})$) which respectively show the probability that an injected fault causes a non-critical error (numerical offset) or a critical error (classification fault). From these results, we devise a fault mitigation strategy to harden the SA-DNN accelerator in an efficient way, both in terms of area and power overhead.

Abstract: We present XgenSilicon ML Compiler, a fully automated end-to-end compilation framework that transforms high-level machine learning models into optimized RISC-V assembly code for custom ASIC accelerators. By unifying the system's cost model across software and hardware, the compiler achieves significant improvements in Power, Performance, and Area (PPA) metrics compared to standard off-the-shelf components and hand-designed chips through five key innovations: (1) a multi-algorithm auto-tuning framework with five search strategies (Bayesian Optimization, Genetic Algorithm, Simulated Annealing, Random Search, Grid Search) combined with a learned cost model, (2) an integrated quantization framework supporting extreme precisions from FP32 to Binary with full KL divergence calibration (2048-bin histogram optimization) and momentum-based QAT gradient updates, (3) hardware-aware validation ensuring 100 percent ISA compliance and memory constraint satisfaction, (4) dynamic shape support with multi-configuration specialization, and (5) advanced cache-aware cost modeling with multi-level cache hierarchy analysis. Our evaluation demonstrates that ASICs produced by this compiler achieve 2.5-4.5x better performance, 3-6x lower power consumption, and 40-60 percent area reduction compared to baseline implementations. The compiler supports more than 100 ONNX operators across 12 categories, implements advanced RISC-V Vector optimizations, and generates hardware-validated assembly code suitable for direct ASIC synthesis. All compilation steps are fully automated, requiring zero manual intervention from model input to ASIC-ready output.

TL;DR: 论文提出针对开源GPGPU平台Vortex的架构优化，通过解耦控制流和数据访问管理，显著提升性能，使其更适合机器学习研究。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vortex作为基于RISC-V ISA的开源GPGPU平台，为GPGPU研究提供了替代商业GPU的选项，但目前性能不足，特别是在控制流管理和内存访问方面，这限制了其在机器学习等应用中的实用性。

Method: 提出两种微架构改进：1) 硬件控制流管理器，加速常规循环执行中的分支和谓词操作；2) 解耦内存流通道，通过有用计算进一步隐藏内存延迟。

Result: 评估显示执行速度提升8倍，动态指令数减少10倍，整体性能从0.35提升到1.63 GFLOP/s/mm²。

Conclusion: 这些增强使Vortex成为下一代机器学习GPGPU研究的理想平台，通过简单而强大的微架构修改解决了性能瓶颈问题。

Abstract: Vortex, a newly proposed open-source GPGPU platform based on the RISC-V ISA, offers a valid alternative for GPGPU research over the broadly-used modeling platforms based on commercial GPUs. Similarly to the push originating from the RISC-V movement for CPUs, Vortex can enable a myriad of fresh research directions for GPUs. However, as a young hardware platform, it currently lacks the performance competitiveness of commercial GPUs, which is crucial for widespread adoption. State-of-the-art GPUs, in fact, rely on complex architectural features, still unavailable in Vortex, to hide the micro-code overheads linked to control flow (CF) management and memory orchestration for data access. In particular, these components account for the majority of the dynamic instruction count in regular, memory-intensive kernels, such as linear algebra routines, which form the basis of many applications, including Machine Learning. To address these challenges with simple yet powerful micro-architecture modifications, this paper introduces decoupled CF and data access through 1.) a hardware CF manager to accelerate branching and predication in regular loop execution and 2.) decoupled memory streaming lanes to further hide memory latency with useful computation. The evaluation results for different kernels show 8$\times$ faster execution, 10$\times$ reduction in dynamic instruction count, and overall performance improvement from 0.35 to 1.63 $\mathrm{GFLOP/s/mm^2}$. Thanks to these enhancements, Vortex can become an ideal playground to enable GPGPU research for the next generation of Machine Learning.

TL;DR: 本文评估了WebAssembly在嵌入式物联网设备上的可行性，通过对比三种微控制器上的性能、内存占用和能耗，发现WASM在跨平台兼容性和安全性方面提供了可接受的性能折衷。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 物联网设备硬件和软件的日益异构化给资源受限设备上的软件移植性、维护性和部署带来了重大挑战。WebAssembly作为一种最初为Web设计的便携、安全、高效的运行时环境，有望解决这些挑战。

Method: 在三种代表性微控制器（Raspberry Pi Pico、ESP32 C6和nRF5340）上评估WASM的性能、内存占用和能耗。比较两种轻量级WASM运行时（WAMR和wasm3）与原生C执行的差异。

Result: 结果显示，虽然原生执行在速度和能效方面仍占优势，但WASM在跨平台兼容性和沙箱执行方面提供了可接受的折衷。WASM在嵌入式物联网应用中是一个可行的选择，特别是当可移植性和安全性比严格的性能约束更重要时。

Conclusion: WebAssembly是嵌入式物联网应用的可行选项，当可移植性和安全性优先于严格性能约束时。进一步的运行时优化可以扩展其在该领域的实用性。

Abstract: The increasing heterogeneity of hardware and software in the Internet of Things (IoT) poses a major challenge for the portability, maintainability and deployment of software on devices with limited resources. WebAssembly (WASM), originally designed for the web, is increasingly recognized as a portable, secure and efficient runtime environment that can overcome these challenges. This paper explores the feasibility of using WASM in embedded IoT systems by evaluating its performance, memory footprint and energy consumption on three representative microcontrollers: the Raspberry Pi Pico, the ESP32 C6 and the nRF5340. Two lightweight WASM runtimes, WAMR and wasm3, are compared with the native C execution. The results show that while the native execution remains superior in terms of speed and energy efficiency, WASM offers acceptable trade-offs in return for cross-platform compatibility and sandbox execution. The results highlight that WASM is a viable option for embedded IoT applications when portability and security outweigh strict performance constraints, and that further runtime optimization could extend its practicality in this area.

Main category: cs.AR

TL;DR: LLaMCAT：针对LLM推理的LLC优化方案，通过MSHR感知的缓存仲裁和线程节流解决KV Cache访问中的带宽瓶颈，在特定场景下实现1.26-1.58倍加速


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLM）在推理过程中需要大量内存，对现有内存系统设计构成挑战，特别是在KV Cache访问中会产生严格的带宽需求和缓存停顿问题。现有方法未能针对LLM解码特有的MSHR争用问题进行优化。

Method: 提出LLaMCAT方法，结合MSHR感知和负载均衡感知的缓存仲裁机制与线程节流技术，优化LLM推理中的最后一级缓存（LLC）。同时开发了混合仿真框架，通过内存轨迹将分析模型与周期级模拟器结合。

Result: 在主要受缺失处理吞吐量限制的场景中，LLaMCAT平均加速1.26倍；在缓存大小也受限时，相比未优化版本加速1.58倍，相比最佳基线（dyncta）提升1.26倍。这是首个针对LLM解码特定MSHR争用问题的解决方案。

Conclusion: LLaMCAT填补了先前工作中针对LLM解码特定MSHR争用优化的空白，为未来硬件平台上的LLM推理加速提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved unprecedented success across various applications, but their substantial memory requirements pose significant challenges to current memory system designs, especially during inference. Our work targets last-level cache (LLC) based architectures, including GPUs (e.g., NVIDIA GPUs) and AI accelerators. We introduce LLaMCAT, a novel approach to optimize the LLC for LLM inference. LLaMCAT combines Miss Status Holding Register (MSHR)- and load balance-aware cache arbitration with thread throttling to address stringent bandwidth demands and minimize cache stalls in KV Cache access. We also propose a hybrid simulation framework integrating analytical models with cycle-level simulators via memory traces, balancing architecture detail and efficiency.
  Experiments demonstrate that LLaMCAT achieves an average speedup of 1.26x when the system is mainly bottlenecked by miss handling throughput, while baselines mostly show negative improvements since they are not optimized for this scenario. When the cache size is also limited, our policy achieves a speedup of 1.58x over the unoptimized version, and a 1.26x improvement over the best baseline (dyncta). Overall, LLaMCAT is the first to target LLM decoding-specific MSHR contention, a gap in previous work. It presents a practical solution for accelerating LLM inference on future hardware platforms.

TL;DR: TD-Placer：一种面向FPGA的时序驱动全局布局框架，通过图表示和轻量级时序优化算法，在保持布线长度最小化的同时显著改善时序性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着FPGA设计规模扩大和异构资源增加，密集互连带来的电阻电容效应使时序收敛日益困难。现有方法在多因素非线性约束、负载和串扰耦合效应下难以构建准确的时序模型。

Method: 提出TD-Placer框架：1）使用图表示捕获全局网络交互；2）采用非线性模型整合多种时序相关特征进行精确延迟预测；3）采用二次布局目标最小化线长，同时通过轻量级算法构建时序项；4）针对网络级时序竞争采用细粒度加权方案平滑降低关键路径延迟。

Result: 在7个真实开源FPGA项目（LUT数量60K-400K）上测试，相比最先进方法：平均WNS改善10%，CPD降低5%；与商业AMD Vivado（5个版本2020.2-2024.2）相比，平均CPD相当（*1.01）。

Conclusion: TD-Placer通过创新的时序驱动全局布局方法，有效解决了FPGA设计中时序收敛的挑战，在保持高质量布局的同时显著提升了时序性能，代码和数据集已公开。

Abstract: Timing optimization during global placement is critical for achieving optimal circuit performance and remains a key challenge in modern Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) design. As FPGA designs scale and heterogeneous resources increase, dense interconnects introduce significant resistive and capacitive effects, making timing closure increasingly difficult. Existing methods face challenges in constructing accurate timing models due to multi-factor nonlinear constraints as well as load and crosstalk coupling effects arising in multi-pin driving scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose TD-Placer, a critical path aware, timing-driven global placement framework. It leverages graph-based representations to capture global net interactions and employs a nonlinear model to integrate diverse timing-related features for precise delay prediction, thereby improving the overall placement quality for FPGAs. TD-Placer adopts a quadratic placement objective that minimizes wirelength while incorporating a timing term constructed by a lightweight algorithm, enabling efficient and high-quality timing optimization. Regarding net-level timing contention, it also employs a finer-grained weighting scheme to facilitate smooth reduction of the Critical Path Delay (CPD). Extensive experiments were carried out on seven real-world open-source FPGA projects with LUT counts ranging from 60K to 400K. The results demonstrate that TD-Placer achieves an average 10% improvement in Worst Negative Slack (WNS) and a 5% reduction in CPD compared to the state-of-the-art method, with an average CPD comparable (*1.01) to the commercial AMD Vivado across five versions (2020.2-2024.2). Its code and dataset are publicly available.

TL;DR: SetupKit：基于统计智能和主动学习的多角点建立/保持时间特性化框架，相比传统方法减少2.4倍CPU时间


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代芯片时序收敛需要准确的建立/保持时间特性化，但依赖数百万次SPICE仿真在不同PVT角点下造成主要瓶颈，通常耗时数周或数月。现有方法收敛慢且探索效率低，特别是在多角点设置下。

Method: 提出SetupKit框架，集成三个关键创新：1) BEIRA（基于统计误差建模的偏置增强插值搜索）加速收敛；2) 电路分析进行初始搜索区间估计；3) 使用高斯过程的主动学习策略，智能学习PVT-时序相关性，主动引导昂贵仿真到最具信息量的角点。

Result: 在工业22nm标准单元上评估，跨越16个PVT角点，SetupKit相比标准实践实现了2.4倍整体CPU时间减少（从720天减少到290天，单核计算），大幅缩短特性化时间。

Conclusion: SetupKit为库特性化提供了基于学习的原理性方法，解决了关键的EDA挑战，为更智能的仿真管理铺平了道路。

Abstract: Accurate setup/hold time characterization is crucial for modern chip timing closure, but its reliance on potentially millions of SPICE simulations across diverse process-voltagetemperature (PVT) corners creates a major bottleneck, often lasting weeks or months. Existing methods suffer from slow search convergence and inefficient exploration, especially in the multi-corner setting. We introduce SetupKit, a novel framework designed to break this bottleneck using statistical intelligence, circuit analysis and active learning (AL). SetupKit integrates three key innovations: BEIRA, a bias-enhanced interpolation search derived from statistical error modeling to accelerate convergence by overcoming stagnation issues, initial search interval estimation by circuit analysis and AL strategy using Gaussian Process. This AL component intelligently learns PVT-timing correlations, actively guiding the expensive simulations to the most informative corners, thus minimizing redundancy in multicorner characterization. Evaluated on industrial 22nm standard cells across 16 PVT corners, SetupKit demonstrates a significant 2.4x overall CPU time reduction (from 720 to 290 days on a single core) compared to standard practices, drastically cutting characterization time. SetupKit offers a principled, learningbased approach to library characterization, addressing a critical EDA challenge and paving the way for more intelligent simulation management.

Motivation: 随着IC设计复杂度增加，手动解释RTL代码并编写规格说明的过程缓慢且容易出错，需要自动化解决方案

Method: 研究提示策略对RTL到规格说明生成质量的影响，引入忠实度评估指标，对开源和商业LLM进行基准测试

Result: 建立了RTL到规格说明生成的评估框架，为IC设计中更自动化和高效的规格工作流程奠定了基础

Conclusion: 该研究填补了RTL代码自动规格说明生成的评估方法空白，推动了IC设计流程的自动化

Abstract: As IC design grows more complex, automating comprehension and documentation of RTL code has become increasingly important. Engineers currently should manually interpret existing RTL code and write specifications, a slow and error-prone process. Although LLMs have been studied for generating RTL from specifications, automated specification generation remains underexplored, largely due to the lack of reliable evaluation methods. To address this gap, we investigate how prompting strategies affect RTL-to-specification quality and introduce metrics for faithfully evaluating generated specs. We also benchmark open-source and commercial LLMs, providing a foundation for more automated and efficient specification workflows in IC design.

Abstract: Efficient mixed-precision MMA operations are critical for accelerating Deep Learning workloads on GPGPUs. However, existing open-source RTL implementations of inner dot products rely on discrete arithmetic units, leading to suboptimal throughput and poor resource utilization. To address these challenges, we propose a scalable mixed-precision dot product unit that integrates floating-point and integer arithmetic pipelines within a singular fused architecture, implemented as part of the open-source RISC-V based Vortex GPGPU's Tensor Core Unit extension. Our design supports low-precision multiplication in (FP16/BF16/FP8/BF8/INT8/UINT4) formats and higher-precision accumulation in (FP32/INT32), with an extensible framework for adding and evaluating other custom representations in the future. Experimental results demonstrate 4-cycle operation latency at 306.6 MHz clock frequency on the AMD Xilinx Alveo U55C FPGA, delivering an ideal filled pipeline throughput of 9.812 GFLOPS in a 4-thread per warp configuration.

TL;DR: KAN-SAs：一种基于脉动阵列的新型KAN加速器，通过非递归B样条实现和利用KAN稀疏性，相比传统脉动阵列将利用率提升至100%，时钟周期减少50%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Kolmogorov-Arnold网络（KANs）相比传统DNN具有更好的参数效率和可解释性，但其核心的B样条激活函数难以加速。脉动阵列（SA）作为高效的DNN加速器，其在KAN加速方面的适用性和效率从未被评估。

Method: 提出KAN-SAs加速器，包含非递归B样条实现，利用KAN的固有稀疏性，增强传统脉动阵列架构，使其能高效执行KAN推理。

Result: KAN-SAs相比同等面积的传统脉动阵列，可将SA利用率提升至100%，时钟周期减少50%（基于28nm FD-SOI工艺的硬件综合结果）。在不同KAN应用上的评估也证实了其效率提升。

Conclusion: KAN-SAs通过专门针对B样条特性和KAN稀疏性优化的脉动阵列架构，成功解决了KAN加速难题，为KAN推理提供了高效硬件支持，同时保持对传统DNN的兼容性。

Abstract: Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) have garnered significant attention for their promise of improved parameter efficiency and explainability compared to traditional Deep Neural Networks (DNNs). KANs' key innovation lies in the use of learnable non-linear activation functions, which are parametrized as splines. Splines are expressed as a linear combination of basis functions (B-splines). B-splines prove particularly challenging to accelerate due to their recursive definition. Systolic Array (SA)based architectures have shown great promise as DNN accelerators thanks to their energy efficiency and low latency. However, their suitability and efficiency in accelerating KANs have never been assessed. Thus, in this work, we explore the use of SA architecture to accelerate the KAN inference. We show that, while SAs can be used to accelerate part of the KAN inference, their utilization can be reduced to 30%. Hence, we propose KAN-SAs, a novel SA-based accelerator that leverages intrinsic properties of B-splines to enable efficient KAN inference. By including a nonrecursive B-spline implementation and leveraging the intrinsic KAN sparsity, KAN-SAs enhances conventional SAs, enabling efficient KAN inference, in addition to conventional DNNs. KAN-SAs achieves up to 100% SA utilization and up to 50% clock cycles reduction compared to conventional SAs of equivalent area, as shown by hardware synthesis results on a 28nm FD-SOI technology. We also evaluate different configurations of the accelerator on various KAN applications, confirming the improved efficiency of KAN inference provided by KAN-SAs.

TL;DR: 本文系统分析了浮点计算内存（FP-CiM）架构中的硬件故障影响，并提出了一种名为SafeCiM的故障弹性设计，显著降低了故障对神经网络推理精度的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大型语言模型（LLMs）等深度神经网络参数规模不断增长，传统加速器面临数据传输瓶颈，计算内存（CiM）架构成为解决方案。浮点计算（FP）CiM因其高动态范围和精度在生成式AI中具有优势，但其硬件故障脆弱性尚未充分研究，这在关键任务应用中构成重大可靠性问题。

Method: 通过在关键计算阶段（包括数字乘法器、CiM存储单元和数字加法器树）引入位翻转故障，系统分析FP-CiM中的硬件故障影响。使用AlexNet等卷积神经网络以及LLaMA-3.2-1B和Qwen-0.3B-Base等先进LLMs进行实验，评估各阶段故障对推理精度的影响。

Result: 实验发现单个加法器故障可将LLM精度降至0%。基于这些洞察，提出了SafeCiM故障弹性设计，相比带有预对齐阶段的朴素FP-CiM架构，能更好地减轻故障影响。例如，在4096个MAC单元配置下，SafeCiM将单个加法器故障导致的精度下降减少了高达49倍。

Conclusion: FP-CiM架构对硬件故障高度敏感，特别是在加法器阶段。提出的SafeCiM设计通过有效的故障缓解机制，显著提高了计算内存架构的可靠性，为关键任务AI应用提供了更可靠的硬件解决方案。

Abstract: Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) continue to grow in complexity with Large Language Models (LLMs) incorporating vast numbers of parameters. Handling these parameters efficiently in traditional accelerators is limited by data-transmission bottlenecks, motivating Compute-in-Memory (CiM) architectures that integrate computation within or near memory to reduce data movement. Recent work has explored CiM designs using Floating-Point (FP) and Integer (INT) operations. FP computations typically deliver higher output quality due to their wider dynamic range and precision, benefiting precision-sensitive Generative AI applications. These include models such as LLMs, thus driving advancements in FP-CiM accelerators. However, the vulnerability of FP-CiM to hardware faults remains underexplored, posing a major reliability concern in mission-critical settings. To address this gap, we systematically analyze hardware fault effects in FP-CiM by introducing bit-flip faults at key computational stages, including digital multipliers, CiM memory cells, and digital adder trees. Experiments with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) such as AlexNet and state-of-the-art LLMs including LLaMA-3.2-1B and Qwen-0.3B-Base reveal how faults at each stage affect inference accuracy. Notably, a single adder fault can reduce LLM accuracy to 0%. Based on these insights, we propose a fault-resilient design, SafeCiM, that mitigates fault impact far better than a naive FP-CiM with a pre-alignment stage. For example, with 4096 MAC units, SafeCiM reduces accuracy degradation by up to 49x for a single adder fault compared to the baseline FP-CiM architecture.

Abstract: We propose a technique to assist in converting a reference layout of an analog circuit into the procedural layout generator by efficiently reusing available generators for sub-cell creation. The proposed convolutional neural network (CNN) model automatically detects sub-cells that can be generated by available generator scripts in the library, and suggests using them in the hierarchically correct places of the generator software. In experiments, the CNN model examined sub-cells of a high-speed wireline receiver that has a total of 4,885 sub-cell instances including different 145 sub-cell designs. The CNN model classified the sub-cell instances into 51 generatable and one not-generatable classes. One not-generatable class indicates that no available generator can generate the classified sub-cell. The CNN model achieved 99.3% precision in examining the 145 different sub-cell designs. The CNN model greatly reduced the examination time to 18 seconds from 88 minutes required in manual examination. Also, the proposed CNN model could correctly classify unfamiliar sub-cells that are very different from the training dataset.

Abstract: Automatic test pattern generation (ATPG) is a crucial process in integrated circuit (IC) design and testing, responsible for efficiently generating test patterns. As semiconductor technology progresses, traditional ATPG struggles with long execution times to achieve the expected fault coverage, which impacts the time-to-market of chips. Recent machine learning techniques, like reinforcement learning (RL) and graph neural networks (GNNs), show promise but face issues such as reward delay in RL models and inadequate circuit representation in GNN-based methods. In this paper, we propose InF-ATPG, an intelligent FFR-driven ATPG framework that overcomes these challenges by using advanced circuit representation to guide RL. By partitioning circuits into fanout-free regions (FFRs) and incorporating ATPG-specific features into a novel QGNN architecture, InF-ATPG enhances test pattern generation efficiency. Experimental results show InF-ATPG reduces backtracks by 55.06\% on average compared to traditional methods and 38.31\% compared to the machine learning approach, while also improving fault coverage.

Result: 分析模型与实验结果高度一致，证明该公式能够准确预测最优分割点k和标签读取减少量。选择过大或过小的k值会显著降低标签分区的效果。

Conclusion: 提出的分析模型使设计者和研究者能够即时计算最优标签分割点并准确估计标签读取减少量，为缓存标签分区设计提供了理论依据和实用工具。

Abstract: Associative cache memory significantly influences processor performance and energy consumption. Because it occupies over half of the chip area, cache memory is highly susceptible to transient and permanent faults, posing reliability challenges. As the only hardware-managed memory module, the cache tag array is the most active and critical component, dominating both energy usage and error rate. Tag partitioning is a widely used technique to reduce tag-access energy and enhance reliability. It divides tag comparison into two phases: first comparing the k lower bits, and then activating only the matching tag entries to compare the remaining higher bits. The key design parameter is the selection of the tag-splitting point k, which determines how many reads are eliminated. However, prior studies have chosen k intuitively, randomly, or empirically, without justification. Even experimentally determined values are ad-hoc and do not generalize across cache configurations due to high sensitivity to architectural parameters.
  In this paper, we analytically show that choosing k too large or too small substantially reduces the effectiveness of tag partitioning. We then derive a formulation that determines the optimal splitting point based on cache configuration parameters. The formulation is convex, differentiable, and capable of precisely quantifying tag-partitioning efficiency for any k and configuration. To validate our model, we experimentally evaluate tag-partitioning efficiency and optimal k across a broad set of cache designs and demonstrate close agreement between analytical and experimental results. The proposed formulation enables designers and researchers to instantly compute the optimal tag-splitting point and accurately estimate tag-read reduction.

Abstract: Digital neuromorphic processors are emerging as a promising computing substrate for low-power, always-on EdgeAI applications. In this tutorial paper, we outline the main architectural design principles behind fully digital neuromorphic processors and illustrate them using the SENECA platform as a running example. Starting from a flexible array of tiny RISC-V processing cores connected by a simple Network-on-Chip (NoC), we show how to progressively evolve the architecture: from a baseline event-driven implementation of fully connected networks, to versions with dedicated Neural Processing Elements (NPEs) and a loop controller that offloads fine-grained control from the general-purpose cores. Along the way, we discuss software and mapping techniques such as spike grouping, event-driven depth-first convolution for convolutional networks, and hard-attention style processing for high-resolution event-based vision. The focus is on architectural trade-offs, performance and energy bottlenecks, and on leveraging flexibility to incrementally add domain-specific acceleration. This paper assumes familiarity with basic neuromorphic concepts (spikes, event-driven computation, sparse activation) and deep neural network workloads. It does not present new experimental results; instead, it synthesizes and contextualizes findings previously reported in our SENECA publications to provide a coherent, step-by-step architectural perspective for students and practitioners who wish to design their own digital neuromorphic processors.

By using ternary DVS outputs and a ternary-input, binary-weight neural network, the design reduces computation and memory needs. Fabricated in 28 nm CMOS, the accelerator cuts data size by 81% and MAC operations by 27%. It achieves 440 ms inference time at just 1.6 mW power consumption, improving the Figure-of-Merit (FoM) by 7.3x over prior CNN accelerators for miniature systems.

TL;DR: 提出一种新型变量点(VP)数字格式，在保持硬件复杂度不显著增加的同时，提供比定点数更大的动态范围，适用于高动态范围信号的VLSI设计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 定点数表示在硬件效率受限的VLSI设计中常用，但其动态范围有限；浮点数虽然动态范围大但硬件复杂度高。需要一种折中方案来高效处理高动态范围信号。

Method: 提出变量点(VP)数字格式，在类似位宽下比定点数提供更大动态范围，同时硬件复杂度增加不明显。通过多天线无线通信系统中的空间均衡矩阵向量乘法引擎验证其有效性。

Result: 后布局VLSI实现结果显示，基于VP的设计相比完全优化的定点设计，面积节省20%，功耗节省10%，且无明显性能下降。

Conclusion: VP数字格式在保持硬件效率的同时，显著扩展了动态范围，为高动态范围信号的VLSI设计提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Fixed-point number representation is commonly employed in digital VLSI designs that have stringent hardware efficiency constraints. However, fixed-point numbers cover a relatively small dynamic range for a given bitwidth. In contrast, floating-point numbers offer a larger dynamic range at the cost of increased hardware complexity. In this paper, we propose a novel number format called variable-point (VP). VP numbers cover a larger dynamic range than fixed-point numbers with similar bitwidth, without notably increasing hardware complexity -- this allows for a more efficient representation of signals with high dynamic range. To demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed VP number format, we consider a matrix-vector multiplication engine for spatial equalization in multi-antenna wireless communication systems involving high-dynamic-range signals. Through post-layout VLSI implementation results, we demonstrate that the proposed VP-based design achieves 20% and 10% area and power savings, respectively, compared to a fully optimized fixed-point design, without incurring any noticeable performance degradation.

TL;DR: 该论文首次全面评估了非AI专用粗粒度线性阵列(CGLA)加速器在Qwen大语言模型上的表现，相比GPU实现了更高的能效，但存在主机-加速器数据传输瓶颈。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在GPU上运行需要大量计算资源，能耗很高。需要寻找在能效和可编程性之间取得平衡的替代方案，粗粒度可重构阵列(CGRAs)是潜在解决方案。

Method: 采用非AI专用的粗粒度线性阵列(CGLA)加速器架构，具有通用、任务无关的设计，但支持领域特定适配。通过FPGA原型实现，使用llama.cpp框架评估Qwen LLM家族，并投影到28nm ASIC的性能。

Result: 相比NVIDIA RTX 4090和Jetson AGX Orin，CGLA加速器在能效方面显著提升：功率延迟乘积(PDP)分别提高44.4倍和13.6倍，能量延迟乘积(EDP)相比高性能GPU降低11.5倍。但系统级分析发现主机-加速器数据传输是主要性能瓶颈。

Conclusion: 粗粒度可重构阵列(CGRAs)是功率受限环境下进行LLM推理的合适平台，无需局限于特定算法。研究为下一代LLM加速器设计提供了指导，特别是需要关注系统级数据传输瓶颈。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demand substantial computational resources, resulting in high energy consumption on GPUs. To address this challenge, we focus on Coarse-Grained Reconfigurable Arrays (CGRAs) as an effective alternative that provides a trade-off between energy efficiency and programmability. This paper presents the first comprehensive, end-to-end evaluation of a non-AI-specialized Coarse-Grained Linear Array (CGLA) accelerator for the state-of-the-art Qwen LLM family. The architecture has a general-purpose, task-agnostic design, yet its flexible instruction set allows for domain-specific adaptations. This flexibility enables the architecture to achieve high efficiency for sustainable LLM inference. We assess the performance of our architecture on an FPGA prototype using the widely adopted llama.cpp framework. We then project its potential as a 28nm ASIC and compare it against a high-performance GPU (NVIDIA RTX 4090) and an edge AI device (NVIDIA Jetson AGX Orin). While GPUs exhibit lower latency, our non-AI-specific accelerator achieves higher energy efficiency, improving the Power-Delay Product (PDP) by up to 44.4x and 13.6x compared with the RTX 4090 and Jetson, respectively. Similarly, it reduces the Energy-Delay Product (EDP) by up to 11.5x compared to the high-performance GPU, demonstrating a favorable performance-energy trade-off. Critically, our system-level analysis identifies host-accelerator data transfer as the primary performance bottleneck, a factor often overlooked in kernel-level studies. These findings provide design guidance for next-generation LLM accelerators. This work validates CGRAs as a suitable platform for LLM inference in power-constrained environments, without being confined to specific algorithms.

TL;DR: 提出混合执行系统，结合编译与仿真，通过选择性函数卸载机制减少动态二进制翻译开销，实现最高13倍加速


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着指令集架构多样化，跨ISA程序执行变得普遍。动态二进制翻译性能差，交叉编译受限于"全有或全无"模式，完全交叉编译常不可行，导致程序有高仿真开销

Method: 提出混合执行系统，结合编译与仿真，具有选择性函数卸载机制。该机制建立跨环境调用通道，将符合条件的函数卸载到主机进行原生执行以减少DBT开销。关键优化解决卸载成本，实现高效混合操作。系统基于LLVM和QEMU构建，自动适用于应用程序和库

Result: 评估显示系统相比现有DBT实现最高13倍加速，具有强大的实用价值

Conclusion: 提出的混合执行系统通过选择性函数卸载机制有效解决了跨ISA程序执行中的性能问题，结合编译与仿真的优势，显著提升了执行效率

Abstract: With the growing diversity of instruction set architectures (ISAs), cross-ISA program execution has become common. Dynamic binary translation (DBT) is the main solution but suffers from poor performance. Cross-compilation avoids emulation costs but is constrained by an "all-or-nothing" model-programs are either fully cross-compiled or entirely emulated. Complete cross-compilation is often unfeasible due to ISA-specific code or missing dependencies, leaving programs with high emulation overhead.
  We propose a hybrid execution system that combines compilation and emulation, featuring a selective function offloading mechanism. This mechanism establishes cross-environment calling channels, offloading eligible functions to the host for native execution to reduce DBT overhead. Key optimizations address offloading costs, enabling efficient hybrid operation. Built on LLVM and QEMU, the system works automatically for both applications and libraries. Evaluations show it achieves up to 13x speedups over existing DBT, with strong practical value.

Motivation: 现有ReRAM图加速器因大量图分区导致内存访问开销大，增加了执行时间、能耗并缩短电路寿命，需要减少内存写入操作

Method: 识别频繁出现的子图模式，将这些模式静态分配到图计算引擎中，使大多数子图处理无需重新配置交叉开关阵列

Result: 相比现有最先进加速器，达到2.38倍加速和7.23倍节能，同时将电路寿命延长2倍

Conclusion: 通过减少内存写入操作，提出的方法显著提升了ReRAM图加速器的性能、能效和可靠性

Abstract: Graph accelerators have emerged as a promising solution for processing large-scale sparse graphs, leveraging the in-situ compu-tation of ReRAM-based crossbars to maximize computational efficiency. However, existing designs suffer from memristor access overhead due to the large number of graph partitions. This leads to increased execution time, higher energy consumption, and re-duced circuit lifetime. This paper proposes a graph processing method that minimizes memristor write operations by identifying frequent subgraph patterns and assigning them to graph engines, referred to as static, allowing most subgraphs to be processed without a need for crossbar reconfiguration. Experimental results show speed up to 2.38x speedup and 7.23x energy savings com-pared to state-of-the-art accelerators. Furthermore, our method extends the circuit lifetime by 2x compared to state-of-the-art ReRAM graph accelerators.

Together with a wider eco-system for software-hardware co-design, hls4ml has enabled the acceleration of ML inference in a wide range of commercial and scientific applications where low latency, resource usage, and power consumption are critical. In this paper, we describe the structure and functionality of the hls4ml platform.

TL;DR: RoMe提出了一种新的HBM内存访问方法，以行粒度访问DRAM，移除列、bank组和伪通道，简化内存调度，用释放的引脚增加额外通道，在最小硬件开销下提升12.5%带宽。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代HBM内存系统保持缓存行粒度访问，引入了bank组和伪通道等结构，增加了时序参数和控制开销，使内存控制器调度变得复杂。大语言模型等深度学习工作负载需要流式传输连续数据块（几KB到几MB），但在传统HBM系统中这些传输被分割成数百个32B缓存行事务，导致调度过于复杂且效率低下。

Method: 提出RoMe设计：1）以行粒度访问DRAM，移除列、bank组和伪通道；2）简化内存调度逻辑；3）利用释放的引脚形成额外通道，增加带宽。

Result: RoMe设计能够：1）显著简化内存调度逻辑；2）在最小额外引脚的情况下增加12.5%的总体带宽；3）为下一代HBM内存系统提供替代方案。

Conclusion: RoMe展示了针对LLM工作负载可以显著简化内存调度逻辑，并提出了一种以最小硬件开销实现带宽提升的下一代HBM内存系统替代方案。

Abstract: Modern HBM-based memory systems have evolved over generations while retaining cache line granularity accesses. Preserving this fine granularity necessitated the introduction of bank groups and pseudo channels. These structures expand timing parameters and control overhead, significantly increasing memory controller scheduling complexity. Large language models (LLMs) now dominate deep learning workloads, streaming contiguous data blocks ranging from several kilobytes to megabytes per operation. In a conventional HBM-based memory system, these transfers are fragmented into hundreds of 32B cache line transactions. This forces the memory controller to employ unnecessarily intricate scheduling, leading to growing inefficiency.
  To address this problem, we propose RoMe. RoMe accesses DRAM at row granularity and removes columns, bank groups, and pseudo channels from the memory interface. This design simplifies memory scheduling, thereby requiring fewer pins per channel. The freed pins are aggregated to form additional channels, increasing overall bandwidth by 12.5% with minimal extra pins. RoMe demonstrates how memory scheduling logic can be significantly simplified for representative LLM workloads, and presents an alternative approach for next-generation HBM-based memory systems achieving increased bandwidth with minimal hardware overhead.

TL;DR: LLMs在金融分类任务中表现出特征影响自解释与SHAP值不一致，与LightGBM的SHAP值也有显著差异，表明LLMs作为结构化金融建模的独立分类器存在局限性。

Motivation: LLMs在分类任务中提供了灵活的零样本提示替代方案，但其在结构化表格数据（特别是金融风险评估等高风险应用）中的可靠性尚不明确，需要系统评估。

Method: 系统评估LLMs在金融分类任务上的表现，并生成它们的SHAP值，比较LLMs的自解释特征影响与SHAP值之间的差异，以及LLMs与LightGBM的SHAP值差异。

Result: 发现LLMs的自解释特征影响与其SHAP值存在分歧，LLMs与LightGBM的SHAP值也有显著差异，表明LLMs作为结构化金融建模的独立分类器存在局限性。

Conclusion: LLMs作为结构化金融建模的独立分类器存在局限性，但通过改进可解释性机制结合少量样本提示，LLMs有望在风险敏感领域变得可用。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have attracted significant attention for classification tasks, offering a flexible alternative to trusted classical machine learning models like LightGBM through zero-shot prompting. However, their reliability for structured tabular data remains unclear, particularly in high stakes applications like financial risk assessment. Our study systematically evaluates LLMs and generates their SHAP values on financial classification tasks. Our analysis shows a divergence between LLMs self-explanation of feature impact and their SHAP values, as well as notable differences between LLMs and LightGBM SHAP values. These findings highlight the limitations of LLMs as standalone classifiers for structured financial modeling, but also instill optimism that improved explainability mechanisms coupled with few-shot prompting will make LLMs usable in risk-sensitive domains.

Conclusion: FaVeX算法和验证器最优鲁棒解释定义显著提升了验证解释的可扩展性，使得对大规模神经网络的正式解释成为可能。

Abstract: Verified explanations are a theoretically-principled way to explain the decisions taken by neural networks, which are otherwise black-box in nature. However, these techniques face significant scalability challenges, as they require multiple calls to neural network verifiers, each of them with an exponential worst-case complexity. We present FaVeX, a novel algorithm to compute verified explanations. FaVeX accelerates the computation by dynamically combining batch and sequential processing of input features, and by reusing information from previous queries, both when proving invariances with respect to certain input features, and when searching for feature assignments altering the prediction. Furthermore, we present a novel and hierarchical definition of verified explanations, termed verifier-optimal robust explanations, that explicitly factors the incompleteness of network verifiers within the explanation. Our comprehensive experimental evaluation demonstrates the superior scalability of both FaVeX, and of verifier-optimal robust explanations, which together can produce meaningful formal explanation on networks with hundreds of thousands of non-linear activations.

Motivation: 高维空间给贝叶斯优化带来挑战，现有方法通过编码结构假设（如局部性、稀疏性、平滑性）来应对维度诅咒，但这些方法可能过于复杂且效果有限。

Method: 采用贝叶斯线性回归（高斯过程+线性核），通过几何变换避免边界搜索行为，利用线性模型的闭式采样和线性计算复杂度优势。

Conclusion: 高维贝叶斯优化需要重新思考传统直觉，简单的线性模型可能比复杂方法更有效，线性核高斯过程提供了计算效率和性能的平衡。

Abstract: High-dimensional spaces have challenged Bayesian optimization (BO). Existing methods aim to overcome this so-called curse of dimensionality by carefully encoding structural assumptions, from locality to sparsity to smoothness, into the optimization procedure. Surprisingly, we demonstrate that these approaches are outperformed by arguably the simplest method imaginable: Bayesian linear regression. After applying a geometric transformation to avoid boundary-seeking behavior, Gaussian processes with linear kernels match state-of-the-art performance on tasks with 60- to 6,000-dimensional search spaces. Linear models offer numerous advantages over their non-parametric counterparts: they afford closed-form sampling and their computation scales linearly with data, a fact we exploit on molecular optimization tasks with > 20,000 observations. Coupled with empirical analyses, our results suggest the need to depart from past intuitions about BO methods in high-dimensional spaces.

Motivation: 传统神经层扩散方法存在三个主要问题：1）基于SVD的层归一化计算量大；2）稠密的每边限制映射随茎维度线性增长；3）需要频繁重建拉普拉斯矩阵且梯度不稳定。这些限制了方法的可扩展性和实用性。

Method: PolyNSD使用归一化层拉普拉斯算子的K次多项式作为传播算子，通过三项递推稳定计算。该方法提供显式的K跳感受野，通过凸混合K+1个正交多项式基响应获得可训练的光谱响应，使用对角限制映射而非稠密映射。

Result: 在异质性和同质性基准测试中都达到了新的最先进结果，仅使用对角限制映射就超越了传统方法，降低了运行时和内存需求，性能与茎维度解耦。

Conclusion: PolyNSD通过多项式算子、对角限制映射和稳定化技术，解决了传统神经层扩散方法的计算和稳定性问题，在保持高性能的同时显著提升了效率和可扩展性。

Abstract: Sheaf Neural Networks equip graph structures with a cellular sheaf: a geometric structure which assigns local vector spaces (stalks) and a linear learnable restriction/transport maps to nodes and edges, yielding an edge-aware inductive bias that handles heterophily and limits oversmoothing. However, common Neural Sheaf Diffusion implementations rely on SVD-based sheaf normalization and dense per-edge restriction maps, which scale with stalk dimension, require frequent Laplacian rebuilds, and yield brittle gradients. To address these limitations, we introduce Polynomial Neural Sheaf Diffusion (PolyNSD), a new sheaf diffusion approach whose propagation operator is a degree-K polynomial in a normalised sheaf Laplacian, evaluated via a stable three-term recurrence on a spectrally rescaled operator. This provides an explicit K-hop receptive field in a single layer (independently of the stalk dimension), with a trainable spectral response obtained as a convex mixture of K+1 orthogonal polynomial basis responses. PolyNSD enforces stability via convex mixtures, spectral rescaling, and residual/gated paths, reaching new state-of-the-art results on both homophilic and heterophilic benchmarks, inverting the Neural Sheaf Diffusion trend by obtaining these results with just diagonal restriction maps, decoupling performance from large stalk dimension, while reducing runtime and memory requirements.

Abstract: Tabular data drive most real-world machine learning applications, yet building general-purpose models for them remains difficult. Mixed numeric and categorical fields, weak feature structure, and limited labeled data make scaling and generalization challenging. To this end, we introduce Orion-Bix, a tabular foundation model that combines biaxial attention with meta-learned in-context reasoning for few-shot tabular learning. Its encoder alternates standard, grouped, hierarchical, and relational attention, fusing their outputs through multi-CLS summarization to capture both local and global dependencies efficiently. A label-aware ICL head adapts on the fly and scales to large label spaces via hierarchical decision routing. Meta-trained on synthetically generated, structurally diverse tables with causal priors, Orion-Bix learns transferable inductive biases across heterogeneous data. Delivered as a scikit-learn compatible foundation model, it outperforms gradient-boosting baselines and remains competitive with state-of-the-art tabular foundation models on public benchmarks, showing that biaxial attention with episodic meta-training enables robust, few-shot-ready tabular learning. The model is publicly available at https://github.com/Lexsi-Labs/Orion-BiX .

Abstract: Interpreting seismic horizons is a critical task for characterizing subsurface structures in hydrocarbon exploration. Recent advances in deep learning, particularly U-Net-based architectures, have significantly improved automated horizon tracking. However, challenges remain in accurately segmenting complex geological features and interpolating horizons from sparse annotations. To address these issues, a hybrid framework is presented that integrates advanced U-Net variants with spatial clustering to enhance horizon continuity and geometric fidelity. The core contribution is the Context Fusion Attention (CFA) U-Net, a novel architecture that fuses spatial and Sobel-derived geometric features within attention gates to improve both precision and surface completeness. The performance of five architectures, the U-Net (Standard and compressed), U-Net++, Attention U-Net, and CFA U-Net, was systematically evaluated across various data sparsity regimes (10-, 20-, and 40-line spacing). This approach outperformed existing baselines, achieving state-of-the-art results on the Mexilhao field (Santos Basin, Brazil) dataset with a validation IoU of 0.881 and MAE of 2.49ms, and excellent surface coverage of 97.6% on the F3 Block of the North Sea dataset under sparse conditions. The framework further refines merged horizon predictions (inline and cross-line) using Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) to produce geologically plausible surfaces. The results demonstrate the advantages of hybrid methodologies and attention-based architectures enhanced with geometric context, providing a robust and generalizable solution for seismic interpretation in structurally complex and data-scarce environments.

Result: 发现不同学习机制（丰富vs懒惰）具有不同的度量和曲率结构，这影响网络对未见输入的泛化能力

Conclusion: 提供了一个几何框架来理解神经网络如何学习在连续流形上执行离散计算

Abstract: Many tasks require mapping continuous input data (e.g. images) to discrete task outputs (e.g. class labels). Yet, how neural networks learn to perform such discrete computations on continuous data manifolds remains poorly understood. Here, we show that signatures of such computations emerge in the representational geometry of neural networks as they learn. By analysing the Riemannian pullback metric across layers of a neural network, we find that network computation can be decomposed into two functions: discretising continuous input features and performing logical operations on these discretised variables. Furthermore, we demonstrate how different learning regimes (rich vs. lazy) have contrasting metric and curvature structures, affecting the ability of the networks to generalise to unseen inputs. Overall, our work provides a geometric framework for understanding how neural networks learn to perform discrete computations on continuous manifolds.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种改进的MLP构造框架，用于在大型语言模型中高效存储事实知识作为键值映射，实现了渐近最优的参数效率，并揭示了事实存储容量与Transformer可用性之间的基本权衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型成功的关键因素之一是其能够将事实知识作为键值映射高效存储在MLP参数中。虽然已有研究提出了显式权重构造来构建这种事实存储MLP，但现有方法存在局限性，需要更通用、更高效且实用的构造框架。

Method: 引入一个改进的MLP构造框架，该框架：1)适用于几乎所有可行的输入-输出对；2)实现渐近最优的参数效率，匹配某些嵌入的信息论界限；3)保持Transformer内事实回忆的可用性。通过该框架发现价值嵌入的度量特性，识别简单的编码器-解码器机制，并揭示事实存储容量与Transformer可用性之间的权衡。

Result: 1)发现了价值嵌入的度量特性，该特性表征了构造和梯度下降训练MLP的事实-参数缩放关系；2)识别出简单的编码器-解码器机制，经验上匹配梯度下降MLP在所有测试输入输出中的事实-参数渐近行为；3)揭示了MLP事实存储容量与其在Transformer中可用性之间的基本权衡。最后展示了概念验证应用：通过一次性替换整个MLP在一层Transformer上实现模块化事实编辑。

Conclusion: 提出的MLP构造框架在通用性、参数效率和实用性方面优于先前方法，为理解LLM事实存储机制提供了新见解，并展示了模块化事实编辑的实际应用潜力，为模型事实知识管理开辟了新方向。

Abstract: The success of large language models (LLMs) can be attributed in part to their ability to efficiently store factual knowledge as key-value mappings within their MLP parameters. Recent work has proposed explicit weight constructions to build such fact-storing MLPs, providing an improved understanding of LLM fact storage mechanisms. In this paper, we introduce an MLP construction framework that improves over previous constructions in three areas: it 1) works for all but a measure-zero set of feasible input-output pairs, 2) achieves asymptotically optimal parameter efficiency matching information-theoretic bounds for some embeddings, and 3) maintains usability within Transformers for factual recall. Through our improvements, we 1) discover a metric on value embeddings that characterizes facts-per-parameter scaling for both constructed and gradient-descent-trained MLPs, 2) identify a simple encoder-decoder mechanism that empirically matches gradient-descent MLP facts-per-parameter asymptotics across all the inputs and outputs we test, and 3) uncover a fundamental tradeoff between an MLP's fact-storage capacity and its usability within Transformers. Finally, we demonstrate a proof-of-concept application of fact-storing MLPs: modular fact editing on one-layer Transformers by \textit{replacing entire MLPs at once}.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TIE框架通过训练-反演-排除的闭环过程，将标准分类器扩展为包含垃圾类，实现可解释的异常检测和不确定性估计，无需外部OOD数据集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度神经网络难以识别训练分布外的输入，导致不可靠和过度自信的预测。需要统一的方法来估计预测不确定性和检测OOD样本。

Method: 提出TIE框架：1) 将n类分类器扩展为(n+1)类，增加用高斯噪声初始化的垃圾类；2) 每轮进行训练-反演-排除闭环：从刚训练的分类器重构高度不确定的反演样本，将其排除到垃圾类；3) 迭代中反演样本从噪声伪影转变为视觉连贯的类原型。

Result: 在MNIST和FashionMNIST上训练，对多样未见数据集测试，实现近乎完美的OOD检测（≈0 FPR@95%TPR）。提供统一可解释的异常检测和校准不确定性估计框架。

Conclusion: TIE提供了一种统一且可解释的框架，用于鲁棒的异常检测和校准的不确定性估计，无需依赖外部OOD数据集，通过迭代精炼过程实现透明洞察模型如何组织其学习流形。

Abstract: Deep neural networks often struggle to recognize when an input lies outside their training experience, leading to unreliable and overconfident predictions. Building dependable machine learning systems therefore requires methods that can both estimate predictive \textit{uncertainty} and detect \textit{out-of-distribution (OOD)} samples in a unified manner. In this paper, we propose \textbf{TIE: a Training--Inversion--Exclusion} framework for visually interpretable and uncertainty-guided anomaly detection that jointly addresses these challenges through iterative refinement. TIE extends a standard $n$-class classifier to an $(n+1)$-class model by introducing a garbage class initialized with Gaussian noise to represent outlier inputs. Within each epoch, TIE performs a closed-loop process of \textit{training, inversion, and exclusion}, where highly uncertain inverted samples reconstructed from the just-trained classifier are excluded into the garbage class. Over successive iterations, the inverted samples transition from noisy artifacts into visually coherent class prototypes, providing transparent insight into how the model organizes its learned manifolds. During inference, TIE rejects OOD inputs by either directly mapping them to the garbage class or producing low-confidence, uncertain misclassifications within the in-distribution classes that are easily separable, all without relying on external OOD datasets. A comprehensive threshold-based evaluation using multiple OOD metrics and performance measures such as \textit{AUROC}, \textit{AUPR}, and \textit{FPR@95\%TPR} demonstrates that TIE offers a unified and interpretable framework for robust anomaly detection and calibrated uncertainty estimation (UE) achieving near-perfect OOD detection with \textbf{\(\!\approx\!\) 0 FPR@95\%TPR} when trained on MNIST or FashionMNIST and tested against diverse unseen datasets.

Result: 理论证明系统信息可恢复的条件，合成实验验证有效性，真实数据集显示PULSE能区分语义类别、提高标签效率和迁移学习性能。

Conclusion: PULSE通过利用动态系统生成模型的结构信息，为生理时间序列自监督学习提供了理论指导的有效预训练框架。

Abstract: The effectiveness of self-supervised learning (SSL) for physiological time series depends on the ability of a pretraining objective to preserve information about the underlying physiological state while filtering out unrelated noise. However, existing strategies are limited due to reliance on heuristic principles or poorly constrained generative tasks. To address this limitation, we propose a pretraining framework that exploits the information structure of a dynamical systems generative model across multiple time-series. This framework reveals our key insight that class identity can be efficiently captured by extracting information about the generative variables related to the system parameters shared across similar time series samples, while noise unique to individual samples should be discarded. Building on this insight, we propose PULSE, a cross-reconstruction-based pretraining objective for physiological time series datasets that explicitly extracts system information while discarding non-transferrable sample-specific ones. We establish theory that provides sufficient conditions for the system information to be recovered, and empirically validate it using a synthetic dynamical systems experiment. Furthermore, we apply our method to diverse real-world datasets, demonstrating that PULSE learns representations that can broadly distinguish semantic classes, increase label efficiency, and improve transfer learning.

Method: 采用双重方法：对数值数据使用进化算法和贝叶斯超参数优化（遗传算法、Optuna），对大规模文本语料使用Apache Spark分布式处理；比较线性模型（SVM、逻辑回归）、深度架构和梯度提升等不同算法

Result: 发现"复杂性悖论"：在高维结构化数据中，优化线性模型优于深度架构和梯度提升；在文本领域，复杂模型因分布式微调限制而过拟合，而基于Transformer的嵌入（ROBERTa）和贝叶斯目标编码等特征工程使简单模型能有效泛化

Conclusion: 提供了基于数据特性和基础设施约束的算法选择统一框架，强调在不同数据领域中算法性能的差异性和适应性

Abstract: This study analyzes the impact of heterogeneity ("Variety") in Big Data by comparing classification strategies across structured (Epsilon) and unstructured (Rest-Mex, IMDB) domains. A dual methodology was implemented: evolutionary and Bayesian hyperparameter optimization (Genetic Algorithms, Optuna) in Python for numerical data, and distributed processing in Apache Spark for massive textual corpora. The results reveal a "complexity paradox": in high-dimensional spaces, optimized linear models (SVM, Logistic Regression) outperformed deep architectures and Gradient Boosting. Conversely, in text-based domains, the constraints of distributed fine-tuning led to overfitting in complex models, whereas robust feature engineering -- specifically Transformer-based embeddings (ROBERTa) and Bayesian Target Encoding -- enabled simpler models to generalize effectively. This work provides a unified framework for algorithm selection based on data nature and infrastructure constraints.

Abstract: In the domain of combat simulations in support of wargaming, the development of intelligent agents has predominantly been characterized by rule-based, scripted methodologies with deep reinforcement learning (RL) approaches only recently being introduced. While scripted agents offer predictability and consistency in controlled environments, they fall short in dynamic, complex scenarios due to their inherent inflexibility. Conversely, RL agents excel in adaptability and learning, offering potential improvements in handling unforeseen situations, but suffer from significant challenges such as black-box decision-making processes and scalability issues in larger simulation environments. This paper introduces a novel hierarchical hybrid artificial intelligence (AI) approach that synergizes the reliability and predictability of scripted agents with the dynamic, adaptive learning capabilities of RL. By structuring the AI system hierarchically, the proposed approach aims to utilize scripted agents for routine, tactical-level decisions and RL agents for higher-level, strategic decision-making, thus addressing the limitations of each method while leveraging their individual strengths. This integration is shown to significantly improve overall performance, providing a robust, adaptable, and effective solution for developing and training intelligent agents in complex simulation environments.

*Anubhab,Rupesh Nasre*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Morphling是一个针对图神经网络(GNN)的领域特定代码合成器，通过编译高级GNN规范为针对不同后端优化的实现，显著提升训练吞吐量并减少内存消耗。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有GNN框架如PyG和DGL虽然注重易用性，但未能解决图神经网络中不规则、内存受限的图遍历与规则、计算密集的矩阵操作之间的执行特性差异，导致缓存局部性差、内存移动过多和中间分配过大等问题。

Method: Morphling将高级GNN规范编译为针对OpenMP、CUDA和MPI的可移植、后端专用实现。它实例化了一个针对每个执行环境优化的架构感知原语库，并包含运行时稀疏感知执行引擎，根据输入特征统计动态选择稠密或稀疏执行路径。

Result: 在11个真实世界数据集上评估，Morphling相比PyG和DGL，在CPU上平均提升每轮训练吞吐量20倍，GPU上19倍，峰值加速达到66倍。内存高效布局进一步减少峰值内存消耗达15倍，使大规模GNN训练能在普通硬件上进行。

Conclusion: 专门的架构感知代码合成为跨不同并行和分布式平台的高性能GNN执行提供了有效且可扩展的路径。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) present a fundamental hardware challenge by fusing irregular, memory-bound graph traversals with regular, compute-intensive dense matrix operations. While frameworks such as PyTorch Geometric (PyG) and Deep Graph Library (DGL) prioritize high-level usability, they fail to address these divergent execution characteristics. As a result, they rely on generic kernels that suffer from poor cache locality, excessive memory movement, and substantial intermediate allocations. To address these limitations, we present Morphling, a domain-specific code synthesizer designed to bridge this gap. Morphling compiles high-level GNN specifications into portable, backend-specialized implementations targeting OpenMP, CUDA, and MPI. It achieves this by instantiating a library of optimized, architecture-aware primitives tailored to each execution environment. Morphling also incorporates a runtime sparsity-aware execution engine that dynamically selects dense or sparse execution paths using input feature statistics, reducing unnecessary computation on zero-valued entries. We evaluate Morphling on eleven real-world datasets spanning diverse graph structures, feature dimensionalities, and sparsity regimes. The results show that Morphling improves per-epoch training throughput by an average of 20X on CPUs and 19X on GPUs over PyG and DGL, with peak speedups reaching 66X. Morphling's memory-efficient layouts further reduce peak memory consumption by up to 15X, enabling large-scale GNN training on commodity hardware. These findings demonstrate that specialized, architecture-aware code synthesis provides an effective and scalable path toward high-performance GNN execution across diverse parallel and distributed platforms.

Abstract: The increasing complexity of IoT edge networks presents significant challenges for anomaly detection, particularly in identifying sophisticated Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks and zero-day exploits under highly dynamic and imbalanced traffic conditions. This paper proposes SD-CGAN, a Conditional Generative Adversarial Network framework enhanced with Sinkhorn Divergence, tailored for robust anomaly detection in IoT edge environments. The framework incorporates CTGAN-based synthetic data augmentation to address class imbalance and leverages Sinkhorn Divergence as a geometry-aware loss function to improve training stability and reduce mode collapse. The model is evaluated on exploitative attack subsets from the CICDDoS2019 dataset and compared against baseline deep learning and GAN-based approaches. Results show that SD-CGAN achieves superior detection accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score while maintaining computational efficiency suitable for deployment in edge-enabled IoT environments.

Conclusion: 该框架建立了语义感知调度作为EHFL在实际场景中的实用且关键解决方案，特别是在训练成本主导传输成本的现实情况下

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) on resource-constrained edge devices faces a critical challenge: The computational energy required for training Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) often dominates communication costs. However, most existing Energy-Harvesting FL (EHFL) strategies fail to account for this reality, resulting in wasted energy due to redundant local computations. For efficient and proactive resource management, algorithms that predict local update contributions must be devised. We propose a lightweight client scheduling framework using the Version Age of Information (VAoI), a semantics-aware metric that quantifies update timeliness and significance. Crucially, we overcome VAoI's typical prohibitive computational cost, which requires statistical distance over the entire parameter space, by introducing a feature-based proxy. This proxy estimates model redundancy using intermediate-layer extraction from a single forward pass, dramatically reducing computational complexity. Experiments conducted under extreme non-IID data distributions and scarce energy availability demonstrate superior learning performance while achieving energy reduction compared to existing baseline selection policies. Our framework establishes semantics-aware scheduling as a practical and vital solution for EHFL in realistic scenarios where training costs dominate transmission costs.

Conclusion: SVGP-KAN成功解决了标准KAN缺乏概率输出和现有GP-KAN计算复杂度高的问题，为大规模科学数据集提供了可扩展的概率KAN框架，并具备结构识别能力。

Abstract: Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) offer a promising alternative to Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) by placing learnable univariate functions on network edges, enhancing interpretability. However, standard KANs lack probabilistic outputs, limiting their utility in applications requiring uncertainty quantification. While recent Gaussian Process (GP) extensions to KANs address this, they utilize exact inference methods that scale cubically with data size N, restricting their application to smaller datasets. We introduce the Sparse Variational GP-KAN (SVGP-KAN), an architecture that integrates sparse variational inference with the KAN topology. By employing $M$ inducing points and analytic moment matching, our method reduces computational complexity from $O(N^3)$ to $O(NM^2)$ or linear in sample size, enabling the application of probabilistic KANs to larger scientific datasets. Furthermore, we demonstrate that integrating a permutation-based importance analysis enables the network to function as a framework for structural identification, identifying relevant inputs and classifying functional relationships.

Conclusion: 传送技术是减少近似遗忘中攻击成功率的通用工具，WARP防御方法能有效缓解遗忘过程中的隐私泄露问题，为机器学习遗忘提供了更安全的解决方案。

Abstract: Approximate machine unlearning aims to efficiently remove the influence of specific data points from a trained model, offering a practical alternative to full retraining. However, it introduces privacy risks: an adversary with access to pre- and post-unlearning models can exploit their differences for membership inference or data reconstruction. We show these vulnerabilities arise from two factors: large gradient norms of forget-set samples and the close proximity of unlearned parameters to the original model. To demonstrate their severity, we propose unlearning-specific membership inference and reconstruction attacks, showing that several state-of-the-art methods (e.g., NGP, SCRUB) remain vulnerable. To mitigate this leakage, we introduce WARP, a plug-and-play teleportation defense that leverages neural network symmetries to reduce forget-set gradient energy and increase parameter dispersion while preserving predictions. This reparameterization obfuscates the signal of forgotten data, making it harder for attackers to distinguish forgotten samples from non-members or recover them via reconstruction. Across six unlearning algorithms, our approach achieves consistent privacy gains, reducing adversarial advantage (AUC) by up to 64% in black-box and 92% in white-box settings, while maintaining accuracy on retained data. These results highlight teleportation as a general tool for reducing attack success in approximate unlearning.

Abstract: Foundation models have revolutionized various fields such as natural language processing (NLP) and computer vision (CV). While efforts have been made to transfer the success of the foundation models in general AI domains to biology, existing works focus on directly adopting the existing foundation model architectures from general machine learning domains without a systematic design considering the unique physicochemical and structural properties of each biological data modality. This leads to suboptimal performance, as these repurposed architectures struggle to capture the long-range dependencies, sparse information, and complex underlying ``grammars'' inherent to biological data. To address this gap, we introduce BioArc, a novel framework designed to move beyond intuition-driven architecture design towards principled, automated architecture discovery for biological foundation models. Leveraging Neural Architecture Search (NAS), BioArc systematically explores a vast architecture design space, evaluating architectures across multiple biological modalities while rigorously analyzing the interplay between architecture, tokenization, and training strategies. This large-scale analysis identifies novel, high-performance architectures, allowing us to distill a set of empirical design principles to guide future model development. Furthermore, to make the best of this set of discovered principled architectures, we propose and compare several architecture prediction methods that effectively and efficiently predict optimal architectures for new biological tasks. Overall, our work provides a foundational resource and a principled methodology to guide the creation of the next generation of task-specific and foundation models for biology.

Abstract: We develop a data-driven framework for learning and correcting non-autonomous vehicle dynamics. Physics-based vehicle models are often simplified for tractability and therefore exhibit inherent model-form uncertainty, motivating the need for data-driven correction. Moreover, non-autonomous dynamics are governed by time-dependent control inputs, which pose challenges in learning predictive models directly from temporal snapshot data. To address these, we reformulate the vehicle dynamics via a local parameterization of the time-dependent inputs, yielding a modified system composed of a sequence of local parametric dynamical systems. We approximate these parametric systems using two complementary approaches. First, we employ the DRIPS (dimension reduction and interpolation in parameter space) methodology to construct efficient linear surrogate models, equipped with lifted observable spaces and manifold-based operator interpolation. This enables data-efficient learning of vehicle models whose dynamics admit accurate linear representations in the lifted spaces. Second, for more strongly nonlinear systems, we employ FML (Flow Map Learning), a deep neural network approach that approximates the parametric evolution map without requiring special treatment of nonlinearities. We further extend FML with a transfer-learning-based model correction procedure, enabling the correction of misspecified prior models using only a sparse set of high-fidelity or experimental measurements, without assuming a prescribed form for the correction term. Through a suite of numerical experiments on unicycle, simplified bicycle, and slip-based bicycle models, we demonstrate that DRIPS offers robust and highly data-efficient learning of non-autonomous vehicle dynamics, while FML provides expressive nonlinear modeling and effective correction of model-form errors under severe data scarcity.

Abstract: Time series forecasting is central to data analysis and web technologies. The recent success of Large Language Models (LLMs) offers significant potential for this field, especially from the cross-modality aspect. Most methods adopt an LLM-as-Predictor paradigm, using LLM as the forecasting backbone and designing modality alignment mechanisms to enable LLM to understand time series data. However, the semantic information in the two modalities of time series and text differs significantly, making it challenging for LLM to fully understand time series data. To mitigate this challenge, our work follows an LLM-as-Enhancer paradigm to fully utilize the advantage of LLM in text understanding, where LLM is only used to encode text modality to complement time series modality. Based on this paradigm, we propose FiCoTS, an LLM-enhanced fine-to-coarse framework for multimodal time series forecasting. Specifically, the framework facilitates progressive cross-modality interaction by three levels in a fine-to-coarse scheme: First, in the token-level modality alignment module, a dynamic heterogeneous graph is constructed to filter noise and align time series patches with text tokens; Second, in the feature-level modality interaction module, a global cross-attention mechanism is introduced to enable each time series variable to connect with relevant textual contexts; Third, in the decision-level modality fusion module, we design a gated network to adaptively fuse the results of the two modalities for robust predictions. These three modules work synergistically to let the two modalities interact comprehensively across three semantic levels, enabling textual information to effectively support temporal prediction. Extensive experiments on seven real-world benchmarks demonstrate that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance. The codes will be released publicly.

*Shenghong He*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种针对联邦强化学习的隐私攻击方法RGIA，通过基于先验知识的正则化约束重构数据的转移分布，成功恢复本地私有数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦强化学习（FRL）虽然通过梯度共享保护数据隐私，但攻击者仍可能利用共享梯度重构本地训练数据。与传统监督式联邦学习不同，FRL中的成功重构不仅需要匹配共享梯度，还需要与环境的真实转移动态保持一致。现有方法在这方面存在不足，需要新的攻击方法来解决这一问题。

Method: 提出正则化梯度反转攻击（RGIA），在优化过程中对状态、奖励和转移动态施加基于先验知识的正则化，确保重构数据接近真实转移分布。该方法通过正则化项将解空间从包含虚假解的广泛集合缩小到同时满足梯度匹配和真实转移动态的约束子集。

Result: 在控制任务和自动驾驶任务上的大量实验表明，RGIA能够有效约束重构数据的转移分布，从而成功重构本地私有数据。理论分析证明基于先验知识的正则化项确实能够缩小解空间。

Conclusion: RGIA是一种有效的FRL隐私攻击方法，通过引入基于先验知识的正则化约束，解决了重构数据需要与真实转移动态对齐的关键问题，揭示了FRL中梯度共享仍存在隐私泄露风险。

Abstract: Federated reinforcement learning (FRL) enables distributed learning of optimal policies while preserving local data privacy through gradient sharing.However, FRL faces the risk of data privacy leaks, where attackers exploit shared gradients to reconstruct local training data.Compared to traditional supervised federated learning, successful reconstruction in FRL requires the generated data not only to match the shared gradients but also to align with real transition dynamics of the environment (i.e., aligning with the real data transition distribution).To address this issue, we propose a novel attack method called Regularization Gradient Inversion Attack (RGIA), which enforces prior-knowledge-based regularization on states, rewards, and transition dynamics during the optimization process to ensure that the reconstructed data remain close to the true transition distribution.Theoretically, we prove that the prior-knowledge-based regularization term narrows the solution space from a broad set containing spurious solutions to a constrained subset that satisfies both gradient matching and true transition dynamics.Extensive experiments on control tasks and autonomous driving tasks demonstrate that RGIA can effectively constrain reconstructed data transition distributions and thus successfully reconstruct local private data.

TL;DR: ASGL：一种基于对抗学习的隐私保护符号图学习方法，通过子图分解、梯度扰动和约束BFS树策略实现节点级差分隐私，在保护敏感符号图隐私的同时保持高实用性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 符号图能建模社交网络中的复杂关系（正负边），但训练敏感符号图存在隐私泄露风险。现有差分隐私方法不适合符号图：边扰动在平衡理论下会导致级联错误，梯度扰动因节点依赖和符号翻转导致梯度极性变化而增加敏感性。

Method: 1）基于边符号将符号图分解为正负子图；2）设计梯度扰动的对抗模块近似真实符号连接分布；3）提出约束BFS树策略结合平衡理论识别生成节点对间的边符号，实现梯度解耦降低敏感性。

Result: 在真实数据集上的实验表明，ASGL在多个下游任务中实现了优越的隐私-效用权衡。

Conclusion: ASGL通过对抗学习框架有效解决了符号图的隐私保护问题，在保持高实用性的同时实现了节点级差分隐私，克服了传统方法在符号图上的局限性。

Abstract: Signed graphs with positive and negative edges can model complex relationships in social networks. Leveraging on balance theory that deduces edge signs from multi-hop node pairs, signed graph learning can generate node embeddings that preserve both structural and sign information. However, training on sensitive signed graphs raises significant privacy concerns, as model parameters may leak private link information. Existing protection methods with differential privacy (DP) typically rely on edge or gradient perturbation for unsigned graph protection. Yet, they are not well-suited for signed graphs, mainly because edge perturbation tends to cascading errors in edge sign inference under balance theory, while gradient perturbation increases sensitivity due to node interdependence and gradient polarity change caused by sign flips, resulting in larger noise injection. In this paper, motivated by the robustness of adversarial learning to noisy interactions, we present ASGL, a privacy-preserving adversarial signed graph learning method that preserves high utility while achieving node-level DP. We first decompose signed graphs into positive and negative subgraphs based on edge signs, and then design a gradient-perturbed adversarial module to approximate the true signed connectivity distribution. In particular, the gradient perturbation helps mitigate cascading errors, while the subgraph separation facilitates sensitivity reduction. Further, we devise a constrained breadth-first search tree strategy that fuses with balance theory to identify the edge signs between generated node pairs. This strategy also enables gradient decoupling, thereby effectively lowering gradient sensitivity. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets show that ASGL achieves favorable privacy-utility trade-offs across multiple downstream tasks.

Abstract: Knowledge Tracing (KT) aims to model student's knowledge state and predict future performance to enable personalized learning in Intelligent Tutoring Systems. However, traditional KT methods face fundamental limitations in explainability, as they rely solely on the response correctness, neglecting the rich information embedded in students' problem-solving processes. To address this gap, we propose Knowledge Tracing Leveraging Problem-Solving Process (KT-PSP), which incorporates students' problem-solving processes to capture the multidimensional aspects of mathematical proficiency. We also introduce KT-PSP-25, a new dataset specifically designed for the KT-PSP. Building on this, we present StatusKT, a KT framework that employs a teacher-student-teacher three-stage LLM pipeline to extract students' MP as intermediate signals. In this pipeline, the teacher LLM first extracts problem-specific proficiency indicators, then a student LLM generates responses based on the student's solution process, and a teacher LLM evaluates these responses to determine mastery of each indicator. The experimental results on KT-PSP-25 demonstrate that StatusKT improves the prediction performance of existing KT methods. Moreover, StatusKT provides interpretable explanations for its predictions by explicitly modeling students' mathematical proficiency.

Abstract: Real-world intelligence systems usually operate by combining offline learning and online adaptation with highly correlated and non-stationary system data or signals, which, however, has rarely been investigated theoretically in the literature. This paper initiates a theoretical investigation on the prediction performance of a two-stage learning framework combining offline and online algorithms for a class of nonlinear stochastic dynamical systems. For the offline-learning phase, we establish an upper bound on the generalization error for approximate nonlinear-least-squares estimation under general datasets with strong correlation and distribution shift, leveraging the Kullback-Leibler divergence to quantify the distributional discrepancies. For the online-adaptation phase, we address, on the basis of the offline-trained model, the possible uncertain parameter drift in real-world target systems by proposing a meta-LMS prediction algorithm. This two-stage framework, integrating offline learning with online adaptation, demonstrates superior prediction performances compared with either purely offline or online methods. Both theoretical guarantees and empirical studies are provided.

Motivation: 现有多智能体强化学习理论研究存在多个问题：内存效率低、样本复杂度对长时域和大状态空间依赖严重、计算复杂度高、非马尔可夫策略、非纳什策略、高burn-in成本

Method: 设计无模型自博弈算法ME-Nash-QL（Memory-Efficient Nash Q-Learning），用于二人零和马尔可夫博弈

Result: ME-Nash-QL输出ε-近似纳什策略，空间复杂度O(SABH)，样本复杂度Õ(H⁴SAB/ε²)；计算复杂度O(Tpoly(AB))且保持马尔可夫策略；burn-in成本O(SABpoly(H))，优于现有算法的O(S³ABpoly(H))

Conclusion: ME-Nash-QL在空间复杂度、样本复杂度（长时域时）、计算复杂度和burn-in成本方面均优于现有算法，为解决多智能体强化学习理论研究的多个障碍迈出了重要一步

Abstract: The thriving field of multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) studies how a group of interacting agents make decisions autonomously in a shared dynamic environment. Existing theoretical studies in this area suffer from at least two of the following obstacles: memory inefficiency, the heavy dependence of sample complexity on the long horizon and the large state space, the high computational complexity, non-Markov policy, non-Nash policy, and high burn-in cost. In this work, we take a step towards settling this problem by designing a model-free self-play algorithm \emph{Memory-Efficient Nash Q-Learning (ME-Nash-QL)} for two-player zero-sum Markov games, which is a specific setting of MARL. ME-Nash-QL is proven to enjoy the following merits. First, it can output an $\varepsilon$-approximate Nash policy with space complexity $O(SABH)$ and sample complexity $\widetilde{O}(H^4SAB/\varepsilon^2)$, where $S$ is the number of states, $\{A, B\}$ is the number of actions for two players, and $H$ is the horizon length. It outperforms existing algorithms in terms of space complexity for tabular cases, and in terms of sample complexity for long horizons, i.e., when $\min\{A, B\}\ll H^2$. Second, ME-Nash-QL achieves the lowest computational complexity $O(T\mathrm{poly}(AB))$ while preserving Markov policies, where $T$ is the number of samples. Third, ME-Nash-QL also achieves the best burn-in cost $O(SAB\,\mathrm{poly}(H))$, whereas previous algorithms have a burn-in cost of at least $O(S^3 AB\,\mathrm{poly}(H))$ to attain the same level of sample complexity with ours.

Abstract: Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL), as a thriving field, explores how multiple agents independently make decisions in a shared dynamic environment. Due to environmental uncertainties, policies in MARL must remain robust to tackle the sim-to-real gap. We focus on robust two-player zero-sum Markov games (TZMGs) in offline settings, specifically on tabular robust TZMGs (RTZMGs). We propose a model-based algorithm (\textit{RTZ-VI-LCB}) for offline RTZMGs, which is optimistic robust value iteration combined with a data-driven Bernstein-style penalty term for robust value estimation. By accounting for distribution shifts in the historical dataset, the proposed algorithm establishes near-optimal sample complexity guarantees under partial coverage and environmental uncertainty. An information-theoretic lower bound is developed to confirm the tightness of our algorithm's sample complexity, which is optimal regarding both state and action spaces. To the best of our knowledge, RTZ-VI-LCB is the first to attain this optimality, sets a new benchmark for offline RTZMGs, and is validated experimentally.

Conclusion: CaDiff是首个使用扩散模型近似因果状态的框架，兼具理论严谨性和实用性，能有效处理P²OMDP中的扰动和部分可观测性问题。

Abstract: A critical challenge for reinforcement learning (RL) is making decisions based on incomplete and noisy observations, especially in perturbed and partially observable Markov decision processes (P$^2$OMDPs). Existing methods fail to mitigate perturbations while addressing partial observability. We propose \textit{Causal State Representation under Asynchronous Diffusion Model (CaDiff)}, a framework that enhances any RL algorithm by uncovering the underlying causal structure of P$^2$OMDPs. This is achieved by incorporating a novel asynchronous diffusion model (ADM) and a new bisimulation metric. ADM enables forward and reverse processes with different numbers of steps, thus interpreting the perturbation of P$^2$OMDP as part of the noise suppressed through diffusion. The bisimulation metric quantifies the similarity between partially observable environments and their causal counterparts. Moreover, we establish the theoretical guarantee of CaDiff by deriving an upper bound for the value function approximation errors between perturbed observations and denoised causal states, reflecting a principled trade-off between approximation errors of reward and transition-model. Experiments on Roboschool tasks show that CaDiff enhances returns by at least 14.18\% compared to baselines. CaDiff is the first framework that approximates causal states using diffusion models with both theoretical rigor and practicality.

Motivation: 现有基于知识蒸馏的时空预测方法主要关注像素级信号和频谱特性，但忽略了视觉模式背后的丰富语义和因果上下文信息，限制了模型在复杂场景下的表现。

Abstract: Spatiotemporal forecasting often relies on computationally intensive models to capture complex dynamics. Knowledge distillation (KD) has emerged as a key technique for creating lightweight student models, with recent advances like frequency-aware KD successfully preserving spectral properties (i.e., high-frequency details and low-frequency trends). However, these methods are fundamentally constrained by operating on pixel-level signals, leaving them blind to the rich semantic and causal context behind the visual patterns. To overcome this limitation, we introduce S^2-KD, a novel framework that unifies Semantic priors with Spectral representations for distillation. Our approach begins by training a privileged, multimodal teacher model. This teacher leverages textual narratives from a Large Multimodal Model (LMM) to reason about the underlying causes of events, while its architecture simultaneously decouples spectral components in its latent space. The core of our framework is a new distillation objective that transfers this unified semantic-spectral knowledge into a lightweight, vision-only student. Consequently, the student learns to make predictions that are not only spectrally accurate but also semantically coherent, without requiring any textual input or architectural overhead at inference. Extensive experiments on benchmarks like WeatherBench and TaxiBJ+ show that S^2-KD significantly boosts the performance of simple student models, enabling them to outperform state-of-the-art methods, particularly in long-horizon and complex non-stationary scenarios.

We formalize this idea into a framework that accommodates several variants of offline RL incorporation such as final policy recommendation and online fine-tuning. We further introduce convenient techniques to improve its effectiveness in enhancing online learning efficiency. Our extensive and systematic empirical analyses show that 1) the effectiveness of the proposed framework depends strongly on the nature of the task, 2) our proposed techniques greatly enhance its effectiveness, and 3) existing online fine-tuning methods are overall ineffective, calling for more research therein.

Abstract: The constrained nature of synthesizable chemical space poses a significant challenge for sampling molecules that are both synthetically accessible and possess desired properties. In this work, we present PrexSyn, an efficient and programmable model for molecular discovery within synthesizable chemical space. PrexSyn is based on a decoder-only transformer trained on a billion-scale datastream of synthesizable pathways paired with molecular properties, enabled by a real-time, high-throughput C++-based data generation engine. The large-scale training data allows PrexSyn to reconstruct the synthesizable chemical space nearly perfectly at a high inference speed and learn the association between properties and synthesizable molecules. Based on its learned property-pathway mappings, PrexSyn can generate synthesizable molecules that satisfy not only single-property conditions but also composite property queries joined by logical operators, thereby allowing users to ``program'' generation objectives. Moreover, by exploiting this property-based querying capability, PrexSyn can efficiently optimize molecules against black-box oracle functions via iterative query refinement, achieving higher sampling efficiency than even synthesis-agnostic baselines, making PrexSyn a powerful general-purpose molecular optimization tool. Overall, PrexSyn pushes the frontier of synthesizable molecular design by setting a new state of the art in synthesizable chemical space coverage, molecular sampling efficiency, and inference speed.

Abstract: Many emerging applications - such as adversarial training, AI alignment, and robust optimization - can be framed as zero-sum games between neural nets, with von Neumann-Nash equilibria (NE) capturing the desirable system behavior. While such games often involve non-convex non-concave objectives, empirical evidence shows that simple gradient methods frequently converge, suggesting a hidden geometric structure. In this paper, we provide a theoretical framework that explains this phenomenon through the lens of hidden convexity and overparameterization. We identify sufficient conditions - spanning initialization, training dynamics, and network width - that guarantee global convergence to a NE in a broad class of non-convex min-max games. To our knowledge, this is the first such result for games that involve two-layer neural networks. Technically, our approach is twofold: (a) we derive a novel path-length bound for the alternating gradient descent-ascent scheme in min-max games; and (b) we show that the reduction from a hidden convex-concave geometry to two-sided Polyak-Łojasiewicz (PŁ) min-max condition hold with high probability under overparameterization, using tools from random matrix theory.

Abstract: Model merging has emerged as a practical paradigm for integrating multiple independently trained models into a single model without joint retraining. Previous studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of combining parameters through strategies such as parameter decomposition, coefficient optimization, and subspace learning, significantly reducing the need for expensive joint training and achieving strong empirical performance across diverse tasks. However, these approaches predominantly treat merging as a problem of parameter space decomposition or fusion coefficient optimization, while overlooking the critical role of directional information in both parameter and feature spaces. In practice, naïve merging introduces inconsistencies in dominant parameter directions and disrupts structural coherence across models, which can degrade performance. Moreover, coefficient-based optimization methods implicitly assume compatible feature-space directions across models. However, Neural Collapse indicates that class features follow structured directional patterns, which may differ across independently trained models, making coefficient optimization alone insufficient. In this work, we emphasize the importance of \emph{directional alignment} and introduce a unified geometric framework, \emph{Merging with Directional Alignment} (\method{}), which aligns directional structures consistently in both the parameter and feature spaces. Our analysis shows that directional alignment improves structural coherence, and extensive experiments across benchmarks, model scales, and task configurations further validate the effectiveness of our approach.

TL;DR: 该研究开发了用于帕金森病步态检测的超轻量1D CNN模型，在资源受限的可穿戴设备上实现了高精度检测，参数数量仅为基准模型的1/10，性能相当或更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对帕金森病步态检测在资源受限可穿戴设备和边缘节点上的部署需求，需要开发高效的时间序列分析方法，替代传统阈值方法，提高检测精度和泛化能力。

Method: 比较幅度阈值法与三种1D CNN模型：文献基准模型（可分离卷积）、纯可分离模型和带残差连接的超轻模型。使用BioStampRC21数据集，2秒窗口30Hz采样，采用留一受试者交叉验证。

Result: 残差可分离模型（533参数）达到PR-AUC=94.5%，F1=91.2%，MCC=89.4%，性能优于基准模型（5552参数）。最小模型（305参数）也表现优异。阈值法召回率高但精度低。胸部和腿部传感器最可靠。

Conclusion: 超轻量可分离CNN在帕金森病步态检测中提供了优于固定阈值方法的精度-效率-泛化权衡，适合边缘部署，并突显了为边缘计算定制时间序列模型的价值。

Abstract: We study on-device time-series analysis for gait detection in Parkinson's disease (PD) from short windows of triaxial acceleration, targeting resource-constrained wearables and edge nodes. We compare magnitude thresholding to three 1D CNNs for time-series analysis: a literature baseline (separable convolutions) and two ultra-light models - one purely separable and one with residual connections. Using the BioStampRC21 dataset, 2 s windows at 30 Hz, and subject-independent leave-one-subject-out (LOSO) validation on 16 PwPD with chest-worn IMUs, our residual separable model (Model 2, 533 params) attains PR-AUC = 94.5%, F1 = 91.2%, MCC = 89.4%, matching or surpassing the baseline (5,552 params; PR-AUC = 93.7%, F1 = 90.5%, MCC = 88.5%) with approximately 10x fewer parameters. The smallest model (Model 1, 305 params) reaches PR-AUC = 94.0%, F1 = 91.0%, MCC = 89.1%. Thresholding obtains high recall (89.0%) but low precision (76.5%), yielding many false positives and high inter-subject variance. Sensor-position analysis (train-on-all) shows chest and thighs are most reliable; forearms degrade precision/recall due to non-gait arm motion; naive fusion of all sites does not outperform the best single site. Both compact CNNs execute within tight memory/latency budgets on STM32-class MCUs (sub-10 ms on low-power boards), enabling on-sensor gating of transmission/storage. Overall, ultra-light separable CNNs provide a superior accuracy-efficiency-generalization trade-off to fixed thresholds for wearable PD gait detection and underscore the value of tailored time-series models for edge deployment.

Motivation: 探索连续控制策略是否可以用离散逻辑电路而非连续神经网络来表示和学习，以创建可直接编译为FPGA电路、具有极低延迟和能耗的控制器

Method: 引入可微分无权重控制器(DWCs)：使用温度计编码输入、稀疏连接的布尔查找表层和轻量级动作头，通过基于梯度的端到端训练，直接编译为FPGA兼容电路

Result: 在五个MuJoCo基准测试中（包括高维Humanoid），DWCs性能与基于权重的策略（全精度或量化神经网络）相当，四个任务表现匹配，HalfCheetah中网络容量是主要限制因素

Conclusion: DWCs成功将连续控制策略表示为离散逻辑电路，实现FPGA兼容、低延迟、低能耗的控制器，同时保持结构稀疏性和可解释性，可直接检查影响控制决策的输入阈值

Abstract: We investigate whether continuous-control policies can be represented and learned as discrete logic circuits instead of continuous neural networks. We introduce Differentiable Weightless Controllers (DWCs), a symbolic-differentiable architecture that maps real-valued observations to actions using thermometer-encoded inputs, sparsely connected boolean lookup-table layers, and lightweight action heads. DWCs can be trained end-to-end by gradient-based techniques, yet compile directly into FPGA-compatible circuits with few- or even single-clock-cycle latency and nanojoule-level energy cost per action. Across five MuJoCo benchmarks, including high-dimensional Humanoid, DWCs achieve returns competitive with weight-based policies (full precision or quantized neural networks), matching performance on four tasks and isolating network capacity as the key limiting factor on HalfCheetah. Furthermore, DWCs exhibit structurally sparse and interpretable connectivity patterns, enabling a direct inspection of which input thresholds influence control decisions.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自主科学发现系统存在三个主要问题：1) 应用领域狭窄；2) 与研究者实时交互有限；3) 缺乏停止探索的原则性机制，导致效率低下、可重复性差和人类专业知识未充分利用。

Method: 提出SelfAI多智能体平台，包含三个核心组件：用户代理（将研究目标转化为标准化实验配置）、认知代理（基于LLM，采用最优停止准则迭代优化超参数搜索）、实验管理器（协调异构硬件上的并行容错训练流程，维护结构化知识库）。同时引入两个新评估指标：Score和AUP_D，分别量化发现效率和搜索多样性。

Conclusion: SelfAI通过多智能体架构和最优停止准则，解决了现有自主科学发现系统的局限性，提高了发现效率，减少了资源浪费，并更好地整合了人类专业知识。

Abstract: Recent work on autonomous scientific discovery has leveraged LLM-based agents to integrate problem specification, experiment planning, and execution into end-to-end systems. However, these frameworks are often confined to narrow application domains, offer limited real-time interaction with researchers, and lack principled mechanisms for determining when to halt exploration, resulting in inefficiencies, reproducibility challenges, and under-utilized human expertise. To address these gaps, we propose \textit{SelfAI}, a general multi-agent platform that combines a User Agent for translating high-level research objectives into standardized experimental configurations, a Cognitive Agent powered by LLMs with optimal stopping criteria to iteratively refine hyperparameter searches, and an Experiment Manager responsible for orchestrating parallel, fault-tolerant training workflows across heterogeneous hardware while maintaining a structured knowledge base for continuous feedback. We further introduce two novel evaluation metrics, Score and $\text{AUP}_D$, to quantify discovery efficiency and search diversity. Across regression, NLP, computer vision, scientific computing, medical imaging, and drug discovery benchmarks, SelfAI consistently achieves strong performance and reduces redundant trials compared to classical Bayesian optimization and LLM-based baselines, while enabling seamless interaction with human researchers.

Motivation: 现有流行病预测方法主要使用简单机制模型或黑盒模型，缺乏可解释性，无法理解信念和行为信号之间的复杂相互作用机制

Method: 基于趋势相似性构建信号关系图，然后应用图神经网络进行预测，通过图结构实现可解释分析

Result: 该方法能够揭示哪些信号更可预测，哪些关系对预测准确性贡献最大，为可解释建模提供早期框架

Conclusion: 提出的图基预测框架是构建整合行为、信念和观测的未来仿真模型的重要一步，为多信号领域的可解释建模奠定了基础

Abstract: Epidemic outcomes have a complex interplay with human behavior and beliefs. Most of the forecasting literature has focused on the task of predicting epidemic signals using simple mechanistic models or black-box models, such as deep transformers, that ingest all available signals without offering interpretability. However, to better understand the mechanisms and predict the impact of interventions, we need the ability to forecast signals associated with beliefs and behaviors in an interpretable manner. In this work, we propose a graph-based forecasting framework that first constructs a graph of interrelated signals based on trend similarity, and then applies graph neural networks (GNNs) for prediction. This approach enables interpretable analysis by revealing which signals are more predictable and which relationships contribute most to forecasting accuracy. We believe our method provides early steps towards a framework for interpretable modeling in domains with multiple potentially interdependent signals, with implications for building future simulation models that integrate behavior, beliefs, and observations.

TL;DR: 增强时间序列生成模型以处理纵向临床数据，同时加入可量化隐私保护，在慢性肾病和ICU数据集上验证效果


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 电子病历的普及带来了数据隐私挑战，严格的保护法规限制了临床数据在机器学习训练中的使用。合成数据是潜在解决方案，但现有生成模型要么难以处理时间序列数据，要么缺乏正式隐私保证。

Method: 增强最先进的时间序列生成模型（Augmented TimeGAN），使其更好地处理纵向临床数据，并加入可量化隐私保护机制（DP-TimeGAN）。使用真实慢性肾病和ICU患者数据进行评估。

Result: 非私有模型（Augmented TimeGAN）在多个数据集上的统计指标优于transformer和flow-based模型。私有模型（DP-TimeGAN）在CKD数据集上保持0.778的平均真实性，在隐私-效用前沿上优于现有最先进模型。两种模型在临床专家评估中都达到了与真实数据相当的性能。

Conclusion: 提出的方法能够为复杂慢性病模型开发提供必要的输入数据，同时不损害数据隐私，在隐私保护和数据效用之间取得了良好平衡。

Abstract: Data privacy is a critical challenge in modern medical workflows as the adoption of electronic patient records has grown rapidly. Stringent data protection regulations limit access to clinical records for training and integrating machine learning models that have shown promise in improving diagnostic accuracy and personalized care outcomes. Synthetic data offers a promising alternative; however, current generative models either struggle with time-series data or lack formal privacy guaranties. In this paper, we enhance a state-of-the-art time-series generative model to better handle longitudinal clinical data while incorporating quantifiable privacy safeguards. Using real data from chronic kidney disease and ICU patients, we evaluate our method through statistical tests, a Train-on-Synthetic-Test-on-Real (TSTR) setup, and expert clinical review. Our non-private model (Augmented TimeGAN) outperforms transformer- and flow-based models on statistical metrics in several datasets, while our private model (DP-TimeGAN) maintains a mean authenticity of 0.778 on the CKD dataset, outperforming existing state-of-the-art models on the privacy-utility frontier. Both models achieve performance comparable to real data in clinician evaluations, providing robust input data necessary for developing models for complex chronic conditions without compromising data privacy.

TL;DR: FairMT是一个统一的多任务学习公平性框架，支持分类、检测和回归三种异构任务，处理部分缺失标签，通过非对称异质公平约束聚合机制实现公平性优化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有公平性方法主要针对分类任务，难以扩展到连续输出；多任务学习的优化结构与公平性要求不匹配，共享表示约束无法控制任务头部的偏差；现有方法将公平性视为与效用的零和博弈，通过降低优势群体性能来实现公平。

Method: 提出FairMT框架，核心是"非对称异质公平约束聚合机制"，将任务相关的非对称违规整合为统一公平约束；通过原始-对偶公式联合优化效用和公平性；使用头部感知的多目标优化代理提供可处理的下降几何，显式考虑头部引起的各向异性。

Result: 在三个包含多种模态和监督机制的同质和异质多任务学习基准测试中，FairMT始终实现显著的公平性提升，同时保持优越的任务效用。

Conclusion: FairMT为异构任务和部分缺失标签的多任务学习提供了一个统一的公平性框架，通过非对称约束聚合和头部感知优化，在保持任务效用的同时显著提升公平性。

Abstract: Fairness in machine learning has been extensively studied in single-task settings, while fair multi-task learning (MTL), especially with heterogeneous tasks (classification, detection, regression) and partially missing labels, remains largely unexplored. Existing fairness methods are predominantly classification-oriented and fail to extend to continuous outputs, making a unified fairness objective difficult to formulate. Further, existing MTL optimization is structurally misaligned with fairness: constraining only the shared representation, allowing task heads to absorb bias and leading to uncontrolled task-specific disparities. Finally, most work treats fairness as a zero-sum trade-off with utility, enforcing symmetric constraints that achieve parity by degrading well-served groups. We introduce FairMT, a unified fairness-aware MTL framework that accommodates all three task types under incomplete supervision. At its core is an Asymmetric Heterogeneous Fairness Constraint Aggregation mechanism, which consolidates task-dependent asymmetric violations into a unified fairness constraint. Utility and fairness are jointly optimized via a primal--dual formulation, while a head-aware multi-objective optimization proxy provides a tractable descent geometry that explicitly accounts for head-induced anisotropy. Across three homogeneous and heterogeneous MTL benchmarks encompassing diverse modalities and supervision regimes, FairMT consistently achieves substantial fairness gains while maintaining superior task utility. Code will be released upon paper acceptance.

TL;DR: ESPO提出了一种基于熵的重要性采样策略优化框架，通过熵驱动的分组机制解决GSPO等方法的梯度利用不足和信用分配问题，在数学推理任务上显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于群体的策略优化框架（如GRPO、GSPO）存在优化粒度与训练稳定性之间的根本权衡。GSPO虽然通过序列级优化提高了鲁棒性，但其保守的裁剪机制会不加区分地丢弃有效训练样本（梯度利用不足），且统一的信用分配无法捕捉关键推理步骤的异质性贡献。

Method: 提出熵重要性采样策略优化（ESPO）框架：1）基于预测熵将序列分解为组；2）熵驱动的重要性采样捕捉序列内异质性；3）熵自适应裁剪基于模型不确定性动态分配信任区域。

Result: 在数学推理基准测试中，ESPO不仅加速收敛，还实现了最先进的性能，将具有挑战性的HMMT基准的准确率从4.4%显著提升至13.13%。

Conclusion: ESPO通过熵驱动的分组机制成功调和了细粒度控制与训练稳定性之间的矛盾，为LLM强化学习提供了更高效的优化框架。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) reinforcement learning has increasingly relied on group-based policy optimization frameworks, such as GRPO and GSPO, to achieve stable fine-tuning at scale. However, a fundamental trade-off persists between optimization granularity and training stability. While GSPO improves robustness via sequence-level optimization, its monolithic treatment of sequences introduces severe inefficiencies: its conservative clipping mechanism indiscriminately discards valid training samples-a phenomenon we term gradient underutilization-and its uniform credit assignment fails to capture the heterogeneous contributions of critical reasoning steps. In this work, we propose Entropy Importance Sampling Policy Optimization (ESPO), a novel framework that reconciles fine-grained control with training stability. ESPO decomposes sequences into groups based on predictive entropy, enabling (1) Entropy-driven Importance Sampling to capture intra-sequence heterogeneity, and (2) Entropy-adaptive Clipping to dynamically allocate trust regions based on model uncertainty. Extensive experiments on mathematical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that ESPO not only accelerates convergence but also achieves state-of-the-art performance, notably improving accuracy on the challenging HMMT benchmark from 4.4% to 13.13%.

Motivation: 传统QSAR模型基于分子描述符，难以捕捉化合物的结构和上下文信息，导致生物活性预测效果有限。需要开发能整合多种信息源的模型来改进早期药物发现中的生物活性预测。

Method: 提出Rep3Net统一深度学习架构，融合三种特征：1) 分子描述符数据；2) 基于图的化合物空间和关系信息；3) 通过ChemBERTa从SMILES字符串生成的上下文嵌入。采用多模态特征拼接进行生物活性预测。

Result: 在PARP-1数据集上，Rep3Net实现了最高的预测性能，优于传统的GCN、GAT、XGBoost等独立模型。为化合物计算筛选提供了可扩展的生物活性预测框架。

Conclusion: Rep3Net通过整合多模态特征有效提升了生物活性预测能力，为早期药物发现提供了强大的计算工具，特别是在PARP-1等关键治疗靶点的化合物筛选中具有应用价值。

Abstract: In early stage drug discovery, bioactivity prediction of molecules against target proteins plays a crucial role. Trdaitional QSAR models that utilizes molecular descriptor based data often struggles to predict bioactivity of molecules effectively due to its limitation in capturing structural and contextual information embedded within each compound. To address this challenge, we propose Rep3Net, a unified deep learning architecture that not only incorporates descriptor data but also includes spatial and relational information through graph-based represenation of compounds and contextual information through ChemBERTa generated embeddings from SMILES strings. Our model employing multimodal concatenated features produce reliable bioactivity prediction on Poly [ADP-ribose] polymerase 1 (PARP-1) dataset. PARP-1 is a crucial agent in DNA damage repair and has become a significant theraputic target in malignancies that depend on it for survival and growth. A comprehensive analysis and comparison with conventional standalone models including GCN, GAT, XGBoost, etc. demonstrates that our architecture achieves the highest predictive performance. In computational screening of compounds in drug discovery, our architecture provides a scalable framework for bioactivity prediction.

Motivation: 现有层次聚类方法面临两个主要挑战：1）大多数方法在没有全局目标的情况下指定树状图；2）基于图的方法通常忽视图结构的重要性，在完全图或静态预定义图上优化目标。

Method: 使用双曲图神经网络在双曲空间中编码图顶点，并通过最小化在图嵌入上定义的近似结构熵来优化。将结构熵重新表述为树上的最低公共祖先函数，然后通过双曲图嵌入和划分树的类比将其松弛为连续结构熵。采用图结构学习策略在训练过程中更新图结构。

Conclusion: HypCSE通过结合双曲空间嵌入、连续结构熵最小化和动态图结构学习，有效解决了层次聚类中的全局目标缺失和结构忽视问题，实现了结构增强的连续层次聚类。

Abstract: Hierarchical clustering is a fundamental machine-learning technique for grouping data points into dendrograms. However, existing hierarchical clustering methods encounter two primary challenges: 1) Most methods specify dendrograms without a global objective. 2) Graph-based methods often neglect the significance of graph structure, optimizing objectives on complete or static predefined graphs. In this work, we propose Hyperbolic Continuous Structural Entropy neural networks, namely HypCSE, for structure-enhanced continuous hierarchical clustering. Our key idea is to map data points in the hyperbolic space and minimize the relaxed continuous structural entropy (SE) on structure-enhanced graphs. Specifically, we encode graph vertices in hyperbolic space using hyperbolic graph neural networks and minimize approximate SE defined on graph embeddings. To make the SE objective differentiable for optimization, we reformulate it into a function using the lowest common ancestor (LCA) on trees and then relax it into continuous SE (CSE) by the analogy of hyperbolic graph embeddings and partitioning trees. To ensure a graph structure that effectively captures the hierarchy of data points for CSE calculation, we employ a graph structure learning (GSL) strategy that updates the graph structure during training. Extensive experiments on seven datasets demonstrate the superior performance of HypCSE.

Abstract: The widespread adoption of complex machine learning models in high-stakes domains has brought the "black-box" problem to the forefront of responsible AI research. This paper aims at addressing this issue by improving the Explainable Boosting Machine (EBM), a state-of-the-art glassbox model that delivers both high accuracy and complete transparency. The paper outlines three distinct enhancement methodologies: targeted hyperparameter optimization with Bayesian methods, the implementation of a custom multi-objective function for fairness for hyperparameter optimization, and a novel self-supervised pre-training pipeline for cold-start scenarios. All three methodologies are evaluated across standard benchmark datasets, including the Adult Income, Credit Card Fraud Detection, and UCI Heart Disease datasets. The analysis indicates that while the tuning process yielded marginal improvements in the primary ROC AUC metric, it led to a subtle but important shift in the model's decision-making behavior, demonstrating the value of a multi-faceted evaluation beyond a single performance score. This work is positioned as a critical step toward developing machine learning systems that are not only accurate but also robust, equitable, and transparent, meeting the growing demands of regulatory and ethical compliance.

Abstract: Given a training dataset, the goal of dataset distillation is to derive a synthetic dataset such that models trained on the latter perform as well as those trained on the training dataset. In this work, we develop and analyze an efficient dataset distillation algorithm for supervised learning, specifically regression in $\mathbb{R}^d$, based on matching the losses on the training and synthetic datasets with respect to a fixed set of randomly sampled regressors without any model training. Our first key contribution is a novel performance guarantee proving that our algorithm needs only $\tilde{O}(d^2)$ sampled regressors to derive a synthetic dataset on which the MSE loss of any bounded linear model is nearly the same as its MSE loss on the given training data. In particular, the model optimized on the synthetic data has close to minimum loss on the training data, thus performing nearly as well as the model optimized on the latter. Complementing this, we also prove a matching lower bound of $Ω(d^2)$ for the number of sampled regressors showing the tightness of our analysis.
  Our second contribution is to extend our algorithm to offline RL dataset distillation by matching the Bellman loss, unlike previous works which used a behavioral cloning objective. This is the first such method which leverages both, the rewards and the next state information, available in offline RL datasets, without any policy model optimization. Our algorithm generates a synthetic dataset whose Bellman loss with respect to any linear action-value predictor is close to the latter's Bellman loss on the offline RL training dataset. Therefore, a policy associated with an action-value predictor optimized on the synthetic dataset performs nearly as well as that derived from the one optimized on the training data. We conduct experiments to validate our theoretical guarantees and observe performance gains.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实社交网络存在结构性不平等（如主导多数群体和弱势少数群体），传统影响力最大化算法不考虑这些不平等会导致结果偏向多数群体，进一步边缘化少数群体。需要设计公平感知的影响力最大化方法。

Method: 提出DQ4FairIM方法：1）将公平影响力最大化建模为马尔可夫决策过程；2）采用深度Q学习结合Structure2Vec网络嵌入；3）使用最大化最小公平目标，优先提升影响力最弱群体的覆盖度。

Result: 在合成基准和真实网络上的实验表明：1）相比公平无关和公平感知基线方法，DQ4FairIM实现了更高的公平水平；2）保持了更好的公平-性能权衡；3）学习的播种策略能泛化到不同问题实例（如网络规模、种子节点数量变化）而无需重新训练。

Conclusion: DQ4FairIM方法能有效解决社交网络中的结构性不平等问题，确保所有社区获得公平的影响力覆盖，同时保持算法性能，并具有良好的泛化能力。

Abstract: The Influence Maximization (IM) problem aims to select a set of seed nodes within a given budget to maximize the spread of influence in a social network. However, real-world social networks have several structural inequalities, such as dominant majority groups and underrepresented minority groups. If these inequalities are not considered while designing IM algorithms, the outcomes might be biased, disproportionately benefiting majority groups while marginalizing minorities. In this work, we address this gap by designing a fairness-aware IM method using Reinforcement Learning (RL) that ensures equitable influence outreach across all communities, regardless of protected attributes. Fairness is incorporated using a maximin fairness objective, which prioritizes improving the outreach of the least-influenced group, pushing the solution toward an equitable influence distribution. We propose a novel fairness-aware deep RL method, called DQ4FairIM, that maximizes the expected number of influenced nodes by learning an RL policy. The learnt policy ensures that minority groups formulate the IM problem as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and use deep Q-learning, combined with the Structure2Vec network embedding, earning together with Structure2Vec network embedding to solve the MDP. We perform extensive experiments on synthetic benchmarks and real-world networks to compare our method with fairness-agnostic and fairness-aware baselines. The results show that our method achieves a higher level of fairness while maintaining a better fairness-performance trade-off than baselines. Additionally, our approach learns effective seeding policies that generalize across problem instances without retraining, such as varying the network size or the number of seed nodes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 全球热浪加剧，但现有数值天气预报模型往往无法捕捉微观尺度的极端温度，导致最脆弱人群（特别是全球南方地区）无法获得及时的早期预警。

Method: 采用图神经网络框架，利用空间学习和高效计算，生成多时间尺度（最长48小时）的局部高分辨率温度预测。

Result: 在加拿大安大略省西南部测试中，模型在1-48小时预测范围内的平均MAE为1.93°C，48小时预测的MAE为2.93°C，表现出良好的预测性能。

Conclusion: 该研究为数据有限地区（特别是全球南方）的局部、公平预测奠定了基础，未来可通过迁移学习技术将模型应用于资源匮乏地区。

Abstract: Heatwaves are intensifying worldwide and are among the deadliest weather disasters. The burden falls disproportionately on marginalized populations and the Global South, where under-resourced health systems, exposure to urban heat islands, and the lack of adaptive infrastructure amplify risks. Yet current numerical weather prediction models often fail to capture micro-scale extremes, leaving the most vulnerable excluded from timely early warnings. We present a Graph Neural Network framework for localized, high-resolution temperature forecasting. By leveraging spatial learning and efficient computation, our approach generates forecasts at multiple horizons, up to 48 hours. For Southwestern Ontario, Canada, the model captures temperature patterns with a mean MAE of 1.93$^{\circ}$C across 1-48h forecasts and MAE@48h of 2.93$^{\circ}$C, evaluated using 24h input windows on the largest region. While demonstrated here in a data-rich context, this work lays the foundation for transfer learning approaches that could enable localized, equitable forecasts in data-limited regions of the Global South.

TL;DR: 本文研究强化学习中的可复现性问题，提出了列表可复现性的概念，开发了保证多项式列表复杂度的表格RL算法，并通过理论分析和实验验证了方法的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 强化学习算法在实践中存在不稳定性和对训练条件变化的敏感性，这导致了可复现性挑战。现有RL算法由于不稳定性表现出指数级的列表复杂度，需要开发能够保证可复现性的新方法。

Method: 提出列表可复现性的弱形式和强形式概念，开发了基于PAC RL框架的表格RL算法。核心创新包括：(1) 基于词典顺序在接近最优选择中选取动作的规划策略，(2) 在随机环境中测试状态可达性同时保持可复现性的机制。

Result: 理论证明该算法能够保证列表复杂度在状态数、动作数和时间范围长度上保持多项式级别。进一步扩展到强列表可复现性，以高概率将可能的策略执行轨迹数量限制在多项式范围内。

Conclusion: 该研究为RL算法的不稳定性问题提供了理论解决方案，新的规划策略可以整合到实际RL框架中提升稳定性，为解决RL可复现性挑战开辟了新途径。

Abstract: Replicability is a fundamental challenge in reinforcement learning (RL), as RL algorithms are empirically observed to be unstable and sensitive to variations in training conditions. To formally address this issue, we study \emph{list replicability} in the Probably Approximately Correct (PAC) RL framework, where an algorithm must return a near-optimal policy that lies in a \emph{small list} of policies across different runs, with high probability. The size of this list defines the \emph{list complexity}. We introduce both weak and strong forms of list replicability: the weak form ensures that the final learned policy belongs to a small list, while the strong form further requires that the entire sequence of executed policies remains constrained. These objectives are challenging, as existing RL algorithms exhibit exponential list complexity due to their instability. Our main theoretical contribution is a provably efficient tabular RL algorithm that guarantees list replicability by ensuring the list complexity remains polynomial in the number of states, actions, and the horizon length. We further extend our techniques to achieve strong list replicability, bounding the number of possible policy execution traces polynomially with high probability. Our theoretical result is made possible by key innovations including (i) a novel planning strategy that selects actions based on lexicographic order among near-optimal choices within a randomly chosen tolerance threshold, and (ii) a mechanism for testing state reachability in stochastic environments while preserving replicability. Finally, we demonstrate that our theoretical investigation sheds light on resolving the \emph{instability} issue of RL algorithms used in practice. In particular, we show that empirically, our new planning strategy can be incorporated into practical RL frameworks to enhance their stability.

TL;DR: 通过预生成低/中难度PDE数据来训练神经网络求解器，可以显著减少高难度问题所需的训练数据量，实现计算效率提升


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统PDE求解器生成训练数据成本高昂，且问题难度（几何复杂度、雷诺数等）增加时，神经网络求解器可能受益更大，但需要解决"先有鸡还是先有蛋"的挑战

Method: 在2D不可压缩Navier-Stokes方程上研究难度转移，系统变化任务复杂度（障碍物数量/位置、雷诺数），通过预生成大量低/中难度样本并纳入训练集来学习高难度物理

Result: 结合低难度和高难度数据，可以比仅使用高难度示例减少8.9倍的计算成本达到相同误差；难度分配策略与总计算量同等重要

Conclusion: 预生成PDE数据的合理策划对神经网络求解器有显著增益，类似于预训练基础模型提升下游任务性能，为高效PDE求解提供了新思路

Abstract: A key aspect of learned partial differential equation (PDE) solvers is that the main cost often comes from generating training data with classical solvers rather than learning the model itself. Another is that there are clear axes of difficulty--e.g., more complex geometries and higher Reynolds numbers--along which problems become (1) harder for classical solvers and thus (2) more likely to benefit from neural speedups. Towards addressing this chicken-and-egg challenge, we study difficulty transfer on 2D incompressible Navier-Stokes, systematically varying task complexity along geometry (number and placement of obstacles), physics (Reynolds number), and their combination. Similar to how it is possible to spend compute to pre-train foundation models and improve their performance on downstream tasks, we find that by classically solving (analogously pre-generating) many low and medium difficulty examples and including them in the training set, it is possible to learn high-difficulty physics from far fewer samples. Furthermore, we show that by combining low and high difficulty data, we can spend 8.9x less compute on pre-generating a dataset to achieve the same error as using only high difficulty examples. Our results highlight that how we allocate classical-solver compute across difficulty levels is as important as how much we allocate overall, and suggest substantial gains from principled curation of pre-generated PDE data for neural solvers.

<details>

Motivation: 连续空间上的扩散模型已有充分的理论和实证研究，但离散情况由于组合结构和缺乏严格分析而面临重大挑战。需要为离散扩散模型建立理论基础和收敛保证。

Abstract: We investigate the theoretical underpinnings of Discrete Diffusion Models (DDMs) on discrete state spaces. Unlike in the continuous setting-where diffusion models are well understood both theoretically and empirically-the discrete case poses significant challenges due to its combinatorial structure and the lack of rigorous analysis. In this work, we establish convergence guarantees for DDMs on both the finite space $\mathbb{Z}^d_m=\{0,...,m-1\}^d$ and the countably infinite space $\mathbb{N}^d$ under mild assumptions, focusing on forward masked and random walk dynamics. Similar to the continuous case, the backward process can be characterized by a discrete score function, whose monotonicity plays a central role in deriving the error bounds of the generated data. Notably, the complexity of our model scales linearly up to logarithmic factors, rather than exponentially, with the dimension, making it efficiently scalable to high-dimensional data. To the best of our knowledge, this study provides the first non-asymptotic convergence guarantees that do not rely on the boundedness of the estimated score-covering not only uniform noising processes on $\mathbb{Z}^d_m$ and on $\mathbb{N}^d$, but also masking-based noising dynamics.

Method: 使用ClinicalTrials.gov数据和临床试验结果数据集，通过统计NLP技术提取文本特征，构建逻辑回归、梯度提升、随机森林等传统模型，并开发基于BioBERT的LLM预测模型

Result: 在1976-2024年完成的101,145个临床试验回顾数据集中，传统模型ROC-AUC为0.64，BioBERT模型ROC-AUC达到0.74，Brier Score为0.185，预测误差比行业基准平均减少40%，70%情况下预测优于基准值

Conclusion: 基于BioBERT的NLP模型能有效预测神经科学临床试验成功概率，为药物开发决策提供数据驱动支持，有助于优化战略规划和投资分配

Abstract: This work presents the development and evaluation of an NLP-enabled probabilistic classifier designed to estimate the probability of technical and regulatory success (pTRS) for clinical trials in the field of neuroscience. While pharmaceutical R&D is plagued by high attrition rates and enormous costs, particularly within neuroscience, where success rates are below 10%, timely identification of promising programs can streamline resource allocation and reduce financial risk. Leveraging data from the ClinicalTrials.gov database and success labels from the recently developed Clinical Trial Outcome dataset, the classifier extracts text-based clinical trial features using statistical NLP techniques. These features were integrated into several non-LLM frameworks (logistic regression, gradient boosting, and random forest) to generate calibrated probability scores. Model performance was assessed on a retrospective dataset of 101,145 completed clinical trials spanning 1976-2024, achieving an overall ROC-AUC of 0.64. An LLM-based predictive model was then built using BioBERT, a domain-specific language representation encoder. The BioBERT-based model achieved an overall ROC-AUC of 0.74 and a Brier Score of 0.185, indicating its predictions had, on average, 40% less squared error than would be observed using industry benchmarks. The BioBERT-based model also made trial outcome predictions that were superior to benchmark values 70% of the time overall. By integrating NLP-driven insights into drug development decision-making, this work aims to enhance strategic planning and optimize investment allocation in neuroscience programs.

TL;DR: FAIR-MTL：一种公平感知的多任务学习框架，通过数据驱动的亚组推断机制，在不依赖敏感属性的情况下实现脊柱融合术后并发症严重程度的公平、细粒度预测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床预测模型中的公平性问题持续存在，特别是在脊柱侧凸脊柱融合手术等高风险应用中。现有公平性方法依赖粗略的人口统计学调整或事后校正，无法捕捉临床人群的潜在结构，可能无意中强化偏见。

Method: 提出FAIR-MTL框架：1）提取紧凑的人口统计学嵌入，应用k-means聚类发现可能受传统模型不同影响的潜在患者亚组；2）基于推断的亚组标签在多任务架构中进行任务路由；3）通过逆频率加权缓解亚组不平衡，正则化防止过拟合到较小群体。

Result: 应用于术后并发症预测（四个严重级别），AUC达0.86，准确率75%，优于单任务基线。性别方面：人口统计均等差异降至0.055，均衡几率降至0.094；年龄方面：分别降至0.056和0.148。SHAP和Gini重要性分析确保可解释性，突出血红蛋白、血细胞比容和体重等临床有意义的预测因子。

Conclusion: 将无监督亚组发现纳入多任务框架，能够为手术风险分层提供更公平、可解释且临床可操作的预测，解决了传统公平性方法的局限性。

Abstract: Fairness in clinical prediction models remains a persistent challenge, particularly in high-stakes applications such as spinal fusion surgery for scoliosis, where patient outcomes exhibit substantial heterogeneity. Many existing fairness approaches rely on coarse demographic adjustments or post-hoc corrections, which fail to capture the latent structure of clinical populations and may unintentionally reinforce bias. We propose FAIR-MTL, a fairness-aware multitask learning framework designed to provide equitable and fine-grained prediction of postoperative complication severity.
  Instead of relying on explicit sensitive attributes during model training, FAIR-MTL employs a data-driven subgroup inference mechanism. We extract a compact demographic embedding, and apply k-means clustering to uncover latent patient subgroups that may be differentially affected by traditional models. These inferred subgroup labels determine task routing within a shared multitask architecture. During training, subgroup imbalance is mitigated through inverse-frequency weighting, and regularization prevents overfitting to smaller groups.
  Applied to postoperative complication prediction with four severity levels, FAIR-MTL achieves an AUC of 0.86 and an accuracy of 75%, outperforming single-task baselines while substantially reducing bias. For gender, the demographic parity difference decreases to 0.055 and equalized odds to 0.094; for age, these values reduce to 0.056 and 0.148, respectively. Model interpretability is ensured through SHAP and Gini importance analyses, which consistently highlight clinically meaningful predictors such as hemoglobin, hematocrit, and patient weight. Our findings show that incorporating unsupervised subgroup discovery into a multitask framework enables more equitable, interpretable, and clinically actionable predictions for surgical risk stratification.

Result: 实验表明：(1) 与最先进方法相比没有遗憾损失；(2) 时间复杂度和成员资格查询调用次数显著减少，在多个拟阵基准测试中验证了有效性。

Conclusion: 通过利用单峰结构，该研究在保持最优遗憾的同时大幅降低了带拟阵约束的组合半赌博机问题的时间复杂度，为大规模或查询代价高的应用提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: We study the combinatorial semi-bandit problem under matroid constraints. The regret achieved by recent approaches is optimal, in the sense that it matches the lower bound. Yet, time complexity remains an issue for large matroids or for matroids with costly membership oracles (e.g. online recommendation that ensures diversity). This paper sheds a new light on the matroid semi-bandit problem by exploiting its underlying unimodal structure. We demonstrate that, with negligible loss in regret, the number of iterations involving the membership oracle can be limited to \mathcal{O}(\log \log T)$. This results in an overall improved time complexity of the learning process. Experiments conducted on various matroid benchmarks show (i) no loss in regret compared to state-of-the-art approaches; and (ii) reduced time complexity and number of calls to the membership oracle.

Abstract: Graph link prediction has long been a central problem in graph representation learning in both network analysis and generative modeling. Recent progress in deep learning has introduced increasingly sophisticated architectures for capturing relational dependencies within graph-structured data. In this work, we propose the Generalized Graph Transformer Variational Autoencoder (GGT-VAE). Our model integrates Generalized Graph Transformer Architecture with Variational Autoencoder framework for link prediction. Unlike prior GraphVAE, GCN, or GNN approaches, GGT-VAE leverages transformer style global self-attention mechanism along with laplacian positional encoding to model structural patterns across nodes into a latent space without relying on message passing. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that GGT-VAE consistently achieves above-baseline performance in terms of ROC-AUC and Average Precision. To the best of our knowledge, this is among the first studies to explore graph structure generation using a generalized graph transformer backbone in a variational framework.

Abstract: Continual learning remains a fundamental challenge in artificial intelligence, with catastrophic forgetting posing a significant barrier to deploying neural networks in dynamic environments. Inspired by biological memory consolidation mechanisms, we propose a novel framework for generative replay that leverages predictive coding principles to mitigate forgetting. We present a comprehensive comparison between predictive coding-based and backpropagation-based gen- erative replay strategies, evaluating their effectiveness on task retention and transfer efficiency across multiple benchmark datasets. Our experimental results demonstrate that predictive coding-based replay achieves superior retention performance (average 15.3% improvement) while maintaining competitive transfer efficiency, suggesting that biologically-inspired mechanisms can offer principled solutions to continual learning challenges. The proposed framework provides insights into the relationship between biological memory processes and artificial learning systems, opening new avenues for neuroscience-inspired AI research.

Conclusion: 指令微调与内存高效优化方法的结合表明Qwen3-8B可作为实时金融NLP应用的可扩展、经济选择，为未来动态量化交易系统提供了有前景的基础。

Abstract: Financial text classification has increasingly become an important aspect in quantitative trading systems and related tasks, such as financial sentiment analysis and the classification of financial news. In this paper, we assess the performance of the large language model Qwen3-8B on both tasks. Qwen3-8B is a state-of-the-art model that exhibits strong instruction-following and multilingual capabilities, and is distinct from standard models, primarily because it is specifically optimized for efficient fine tuning and high performance on reasoning-based benchmarks, making it suitable for financial applications. To adapt this model, we apply Noisy Embedding Instruction Finetuning and based on our previous work, this method increases robustness by injecting controlled noise into the embedding layers during supervised adaptation. We improve efficiency further with Rank-stabilized Low-Rank Adaptation low-rank optimization approach, and FlashAttention, which allow for faster training with lower GPU memory. For both tasks, we benchmark Qwen3-8B against standard classical transformer models, such as T5, BERT, and RoBERTa, and large models at scale, such as LLaMA1-7B, LLaMA2-7B, and Baichuan2-7B. The findings reveal that Qwen3-8B consistently surpasses these baselines by obtaining better classification accuracy and needing fewer training epochs. The synergy of instruction-based fine-tuning and memory-efficient optimization methods suggests Qwen3-8B can potentially serve as a scalable, economical option for real-time financial NLP applications. Qwen3-8B provides a very promising base for advancing dynamic quantitative trading systems in the future.

DP-FinDiff employs embedding-based representations for categorical features, reducing encoding overhead and scaling to high-dimensional datasets. To adapt DP-training to the diffusion process, we propose two privacy-aware training strategies: an adaptive timestep sampler that aligns updates with diffusion dynamics, and a feature-aggregated loss that mitigates clipping-induced bias. Together, these enhancements improve fidelity and downstream utility without weakening privacy guarantees. On financial and medical datasets, DP-FinDiff achieves 16-42% higher utility than DP baselines at comparable privacy levels, demonstrating its promise for safe and effective data sharing in sensitive domains.

Abstract: The development of autonomous machine learning (ML) agents capable of end-to-end data science workflows represents a significant frontier in artificial intelligence. These agents must orchestrate complex sequences of data analysis, feature engineering, model selection, and hyperparameter optimization, tasks that require sophisticated planning and iteration. While recent work on building ML agents has explored using large language models (LLMs) for direct code generation, tool-augmented approaches offer greater modularity and reliability. However, existing tool-use benchmarks focus primarily on task-specific tool selection or argument extraction for tool invocation, failing to evaluate the sophisticated planning capabilities required for ML Agents. In this work, we introduce a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating tool-augmented ML agents using a curated set of 61 specialized tools and 15 tabular ML challenges from Kaggle. Our benchmark goes beyond traditional tool-use evaluation by incorporating an in-memory named object management, allowing agents to flexibly name, save, and retrieve intermediate results throughout the workflows. We demonstrate that standard ReAct-style approaches struggle to generate valid tool sequences for complex ML pipelines, and that tree search methods with LLM-based evaluation underperform due to inconsistent state scoring. To address these limitations, we propose two simple approaches: 1) using shaped deterministic rewards with structured textual feedback, and 2) decomposing the original problem into a sequence of sub-tasks, which significantly improves trajectory validity and task performance. Using GPT-4o, our approach improves over ReAct by 16.52 percentile positions, taking the median across all Kaggle challenges. We believe our work provides a foundation for developing more capable tool-augmented planning ML agents.

Motivation: 经典统计推断和学习理论无法解释现代神经网络的成功，因为这些模型是非可识别的（奇异的），违反了PAC边界和渐近正态性的核心假设。奇异学习理论作为基于代数几何的物理启发框架，有望弥合理论与实践的差距。

Conclusion: 论文展示了奇异学习理论在理解神经网络相变方面的诸多优点，并为该领域提出了开放的研究问题。SLT为弥合神经网络理论与实践之间的差距提供了有前景的框架。

Abstract: Classical statistical inference and learning theory often fail to explain the success of modern neural networks. A key reason is that these models are non-identifiable (singular), violating core assumptions behind PAC bounds and asymptotic normality. Singular learning theory (SLT), a physics-inspired framework grounded in algebraic geometry, has gained popularity for its ability to close this theory-practice gap. In this paper, we empirically study SLT in toy settings relevant to interpretability and phase transitions. First, we understand the SLT free energy $\mathcal{F}_n$ by testing an Arrhenius-style rate hypothesis using both a grokking modulo-arithmetic model and Anthropic's Toy Models of Superposition. Second, we understand the local learning coefficient $λ_α$ by measuring how it scales with problem difficulty across several controlled network families (polynomial regressors, low-rank linear networks, and low-rank autoencoders). Our experiments recover known scaling laws while others yield meaningful deviations from theoretical expectations.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文系统比较了流匹配（FM）与扩散模型在表格数据合成中的表现，发现TabbyFlow（流匹配方法）在数据效用和计算效率上优于扩散基准，且OT路径表现更佳，随机化流能平衡效用与隐私风险。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 合成数据生成是隐私保护数据共享的重要工具。虽然扩散模型近期表现优异，但流匹配提供了有前景的替代方案。本文旨在系统比较流匹配与扩散方法在表格数据合成中的表现，探索不同概率路径和采样策略对数据效用与隐私风险的影响。

Method: 本文实现了多种流匹配方法（FM和变分FM）用于表格数据合成，并与最先进的扩散方法（TabDDPM和TabSyn）进行对比。评估了两种概率路径：标准最优传输（OT）路径和方差保持（VP）路径，并比较了确定性和随机采样器。通过变分流匹配实现了随机采样，系统分析了数据效用与隐私风险之间的经验关系。

Result: 流匹配方法（特别是TabbyFlow）在性能上优于扩散基准。流匹配方法仅需极少的函数评估（≤100步）就能达到更好性能，具有显著的计算优势。OT路径表现更佳，而VP路径在降低披露风险方面有潜力。随机化流不仅能保持边缘分布，在某些情况下还能生成高效用且低风险的合成数据。

Conclusion: 流匹配是表格数据合成的有效方法，在计算效率和性能上都优于扩散模型。概率路径的选择至关重要，OT路径性能更优，VP路径隐私保护更好。随机化流匹配能平衡数据效用与隐私风险，为隐私保护数据共享提供了有前景的解决方案。

Abstract: Synthetic data generation is an important tool for privacy-preserving data sharing. While diffusion models have set recent benchmarks, flow matching (FM) offers a promising alternative. This paper presents different ways to implement flow matching for tabular data synthesis. We provide a comprehensive empirical study that compares flow matching (FM and variational FM) with a state-of-the-art diffusion method (TabDDPM and TabSyn) in tabular data synthesis. We evaluate both the standard Optimal Transport (OT) and the Variance Preserving (VP) probability paths, and also compare deterministic and stochastic samplers -- something possible when learning to generate using \textit{variational} flow matching -- characterising the empirical relationship between data utility and privacy risk. Our key findings reveal that flow matching, particularly TabbyFlow, outperforms diffusion baselines. Flow matching methods also achieves better performance with remarkably low function evaluations ($\leq$ 100 steps), offering a substantial computational advantage. The choice of probability path is also crucial, as using the OT path demonstrates superior performance, while VP has potential for producing synthetic data with lower disclosure risk. Lastly, our results show that making flows stochastic not only preserves marginal distributions but, in some instances, enables the generation of high utility synthetic data with reduced disclosure risk.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 研究者创建了DAVIS-complete数据集，包含4032个涉及蛋白质修饰的激酶-配体对，并设计了三个基准测试来评估模型在蛋白质修饰情况下的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI模型在药物发现任务（如蛋白质-配体结合亲和力预测）中过度拟合于简化的数据集，这些数据集无法代表自然发生且具有生物学相关性的蛋白质修饰。

Method: 1. 创建DAVIS-complete数据集，包含4032个涉及取代、插入、缺失和磷酸化事件的激酶-配体对；2. 设计三个基准测试：增强数据集预测、野生型到修饰的泛化、少样本修饰泛化；3. 对无对接和有对接方法进行广泛评估。

Result: 有对接模型在零样本设置中泛化更好，而无对接模型倾向于过度拟合野生型蛋白质，难以处理未见过的修饰，但在少量修饰样本上微调后表现显著改善。

Conclusion: 该数据集和基准测试为开发能更好泛化到蛋白质修饰的模型提供了有价值的基础，最终将推动药物发现中的精准医学发展。

Abstract: Advancements in AI for science unlocks capabilities for critical drug discovery tasks such as protein-ligand binding affinity prediction. However, current models overfit to existing oversimplified datasets that does not represent naturally occurring and biologically relevant proteins with modifications. In this work, we curate a complete and modification-aware version of the widely used DAVIS dataset by incorporating 4,032 kinase-ligand pairs involving substitutions, insertions, deletions, and phosphorylation events. This enriched dataset enables benchmarking of predictive models under biologically realistic conditions. Based on this new dataset, we propose three benchmark settings-Augmented Dataset Prediction, Wild-Type to Modification Generalization, and Few-Shot Modification Generalization-designed to assess model robustness in the presence of protein modifications. Through extensive evaluation of both docking-free and docking-based methods, we find that docking-based model generalize better in zero-shot settings. In contrast, docking-free models tend to overfit to wild-type proteins and struggle with unseen modifications but show notable improvement when fine-tuned on a small set of modified examples. We anticipate that the curated dataset and benchmarks offer a valuable foundation for developing models that better generalize to protein modifications, ultimately advancing precision medicine in drug discovery.

*Zhuohua Liu,Kaiqi Huang,Qinxin Mei,Yuanqi Hu,Wei W. Xing*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出Circuit Prior Network (CPN)，结合预训练的表格基础模型和直接期望改进，解决模拟电路优化中传统高斯过程代理模型在小样本下对非线性电路拟合不佳的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统高斯过程代理模型假设全局平滑、平稳的先验，与模拟电路中的指数器件定律、有理传递函数和区域依赖动态等结构化物理特性不匹配，导致在50-100个评估点的小样本情况下对高度非线性电路拟合效果差。

Method: 提出Circuit Prior Network (CPN)，结合预训练的表格基础模型(TabPFN v2)和直接期望改进(DEI)，在离散后验下精确计算期望改进，而不是使用高斯近似。

Result: 在6个电路和25个基线方法上，结构匹配的先验在小样本情况下达到R²≈0.99，而GP-Matérn在Bandgap上仅达到R²=0.16；获得1.05-3.81倍的FoM提升，减少3.34-11.89倍的迭代次数。

Conclusion: 研究表明，从手工制作模型作为先验转向系统化的物理信息结构识别，预训练的结构匹配先验能够实现可靠优化而无需针对每个电路进行工程调整。

Abstract: Analog circuit optimization is typically framed as black-box search over arbitrary smooth functions, yet device physics constrains performance mappings to structured families: exponential device laws, rational transfer functions, and regime-dependent dynamics. Off-the-shelf Gaussian-process surrogates impose globally smooth, stationary priors that are misaligned with these regime-switching primitives and can severely misfit highly nonlinear circuits at realistic sample sizes (50--100 evaluations). We demonstrate that pre-trained tabular models encoding these primitives enable reliable optimization without per-circuit engineering. Circuit Prior Network (CPN) combines a tabular foundation model (TabPFN v2) with Direct Expected Improvement (DEI), computing expected improvement exactly under discrete posteriors rather than Gaussian approximations. Across 6 circuits and 25 baselines, structure-matched priors achieve $R^2 \approx 0.99$ in small-sample regimes where GP-Matérn attains only $R^2 = 0.16$ on Bandgap, deliver $1.05$--$3.81\times$ higher FoM with $3.34$--$11.89\times$ fewer iterations, and suggest a shift from hand-crafting models as priors toward systematic physics-informed structure identification. Our code will be made publicly available upon paper acceptance.

TL;DR: 提出MPAIACL方法，通过对比学习利用潜在空间信息解决图数据中的协变量分布偏移问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图神经网络大多无法处理协变量分布偏移，且现有方法未能充分利用潜在空间的丰富信息

Method: MPAIACL（基于对比学习的更强大对抗不变增强），利用对比学习挖掘向量表示的内在信息

Result: 在多个公共OOD数据集上表现优于基线方法，展现出强大的泛化能力和有效性

Conclusion: MPAIACL通过对比学习充分利用潜在空间信息，有效解决了图数据中的协变量分布偏移问题

Abstract: Covariate distribution shift occurs when certain structural features present in the test set are absent from the training set. It is a common type of out-of-distribution (OOD) problem, frequently encountered in real-world graph data with complex structures. Existing research has revealed that most out-of-the-box graph neural networks (GNNs) fail to account for covariate shifts. Furthermore, we observe that existing methods aimed at addressing covariate shifts often fail to fully leverage the rich information contained within the latent space. Motivated by the potential of the latent space, we introduce a new method called MPAIACL for More Powerful Adversarial Invariant Augmentation using Contrastive Learning. MPAIACL leverages contrastive learning to unlock the full potential of vector representations by harnessing their intrinsic information. Through extensive experiments, MPAIACL demonstrates its robust generalization and effectiveness, as it performs well compared with other baselines across various public OOD datasets. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/flzeng1/MPAIACL.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出一种"升级与合并"的MoE奖励建模方法，通过将密集奖励模型升级为MoE架构，再合并回密集模型，在保持性能的同时显著降低推理成本，有效缓解奖励黑客攻击问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统奖励模型容易受到奖励黑客攻击或过度优化，策略会利用捷径模式获得高奖励分数，但这些分数并不能反映真实的人类偏好。虽然基于MoE的奖励模型可以增强判别能力，但通常会带来大量计算开销。

Method: 提出"升级与合并"MoE奖励建模方法：1) 将密集奖励模型升级为MoE架构，其中共享专家捕获通用知识，普通专家专注于指令特定模式；2) 应用路由权重归一化；3) 通过可学习的加权平均机制将专家合并回密集模型，保留性能增益同时显著降低推理成本。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在不同模型规模下都能有效缓解奖励黑客攻击问题，在保持性能的同时显著降低了推理成本。

Conclusion: 这项工作凸显了"升级与合并"MoE结构在提高RLHF奖励模型的鲁棒性和效率方面的潜力，为解决奖励黑客攻击问题提供了一种有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Reward models play a critical role in Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) by assessing the consistency between generated outputs and human preferences. However, conventional reward models are prone to reward hacking or over-optimization, where the policy exploits shortcut patterns to obtain high reward scores that do not reflect true human preference. Although Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)-based reward models can enhance discriminative capability, they typically introduce substantial computational overhead. To address these challenges, we propose an upcycle and merge MoE reward modeling approach. We first upcycle a dense reward model into a MoE architecture, where a shared expert captures general knowledge, while normal experts specialize in instruction-specific patterns. We then apply routing-weight normalization and merge experts back into a dense model through a learnable weight-averaging mechanism, preserving performance gains while significantly reducing inference cost. Experimental results demonstrate that our method effectively mitigates reward hacking across various model scales. Our work highlights the potential of upcycle and merge MoE structures for improving both robustness and efficiency of RLHF reward models.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出利用多模态大语言模型实现用户驱动的聚类，通过挖掘MLLM隐藏状态的特征相关性，结合轻量级聚类头和伪标签学习，提升聚类准确性和用户适应性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统深度聚类方法只能提供单一聚类结果，假设固定的数据分布，无法满足用户多样化的语义需求。需要开发能够根据用户指定标准进行自适应聚类的系统

Method: 1) 发现MLLM文本标记隐藏状态与对应特征强相关，利用这些嵌入进行用户定义标准的聚类；2) 采用轻量级聚类头并结合伪标签学习，显著提升聚类准确性

Result: 在多个数据集和指标上的广泛实验表明，该方法具有竞争力的性能表现

Conclusion: 通过利用MLLM的隐藏状态特征和伪标签学习，成功实现了用户驱动的自适应聚类，克服了传统聚类方法的局限性

Abstract: Typical deep clustering methods, while achieving notable progress, can only provide one clustering result per dataset. This limitation arises from their assumption of a fixed underlying data distribution, which may fail to meet user needs and provide unsatisfactory clustering outcomes. Our work investigates how multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) can be leveraged to achieve user-driven clustering, emphasizing their adaptability to user-specified semantic requirements. However, directly using MLLM output for clustering has risks for producing unstructured and generic image descriptions instead of feature-specific and concrete ones. To address these issues, our method first discovers that MLLMs' hidden states of text tokens are strongly related to the corresponding features, and leverages these embeddings to perform clusterings from any user-defined criteria. We also employ a lightweight clustering head augmented with pseudo-label learning, significantly enhancing clustering accuracy. Extensive experiments demonstrate its competitive performance on diverse datasets and metrics.

TL;DR: 本文开发了两个深度学习框架：COVE-NN（基于LSTM的调度策略）和发电建模框架，分别减少年度COVE 32.3%和降低RMSE 9.5%，为混合风电场提供更稳健的数据驱动调度策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 混合风电场（风电场+储能）需要优化调度策略以最大化风能价值。现有方法需要改进，特别是利用本地电网需求和市场条件的数据驱动策略，以及通过合成发电数据提高策略鲁棒性。

Method: 开发了两个深度学习框架：1) COVE-NN：基于LSTM的调度策略，针对单个风电场，使用本地电网需求和市场条件作为输入；2) 发电建模框架：基于大气条件合成发电数据，提高调度策略的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 这两个模型为更稳健的数据驱动调度策略铺平了道路，并可扩展到其他可再生能源系统，提高混合风电场的运营效率和经济效益。

Abstract: Wind farms with integrated energy storage, or hybrid wind farms, are able to store energy and dispatch it to the grid following an operational strategy. For individual wind farms with integrated energy storage capacity, data-driven dispatch strategies using localized grid demand and market conditions as input parameters stand to maximize wind energy value. Synthetic power generation data modeled on atmospheric conditions provide another avenue for improving the robustness of data-driven dispatch strategies. To these ends, the present work develops two deep learning frameworks: COVE-NN, an LSTM-based dispatch strategy tailored to individual wind farms, which reduced annual COVE by 32.3% over 43 years of simulated operations in a case study at the Pyron site; and a power generation modeling framework that reduced RMSE by 9.5% and improved power curve similarity by 18.9% when validated on the Palouse wind farm. Together, these models pave the way for more robust, data-driven dispatch strategies and potential extensions to other renewable energy systems.

TL;DR: REM基准测试揭示多模态大语言模型缺乏人类般的空间推理能力，特别是在动态视角下的物体恒存、空间关系和数量追踪方面存在显著不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类通过导航建立视角独立的认知地图，能直观推理物体恒存和空间关系。尽管多模态大语言模型经过大量视频训练，但仍缺乏这种基础的空间推理能力，这对具身应用构成关键限制。

Method: 引入REM基准测试，使用可控3D环境进行长时程具身空间推理评估。系统评估物体恒存/区分、空间关系和数量追踪等关键方面，涵盖动态具身视角。

Result: 当前最佳模型表现出有希望的整体性能，但在中等复杂度水平上可靠性急剧下降，而人类能轻松处理这些任务。模型从序列视觉输入中发展稳健空间表征面临挑战。

Conclusion: REM基准提供了有针对性的指标和诊断工具，旨在促进未来模型空间理解能力的改进，解决多模态大语言模型在具身空间推理方面的根本局限性。

Abstract: Humans build viewpoint-independent cognitive maps through navigation, enabling intuitive reasoning about object permanence and spatial relations. We argue that multimodal large language models (MLLMs), despite extensive video training, lack this fundamental spatial reasoning capability, a critical limitation for embodied applications. To demonstrate these limitations and drive research, we introduce REM (Reasoning over Embodied Multi-Frame Trajectories), a benchmark using controllable 3D environments for long-horizon embodied spatial reasoning. REM systematically evaluates key aspects like object permanence/distinction, spatial relationships, and numerical tracking across dynamic embodied viewpoints. Our evaluation shows that the best-performing current models exhibit promising overall performance, but become increasingly unreliable at even moderate complexity levels easily handled by humans. These findings highlight challenges MLLMs face in developing robust spatial representations from sequential visual input. Consequently, REM provides targeted metrics and diagnostics to foster improved spatial understanding in future models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法如Xu2024需要超线性样本增长(O(t^{1+s}))，限制了实际应用。需要一种能在固定样本量下稳定训练的方法来防止模型崩溃

Method: 设计神经网络滤波器学习满足收缩条件，开发专门的网络架构和损失函数，确保在指数族分布中满足假设2.3的收缩条件

Conclusion: 该方法完全消除了对样本量增长的依赖，提供了端到端的实用解决方案，为生成模型的稳定递归训练提供了新途径

Abstract: This paper presents a neural network filter method based on contraction operators to address model collapse in recursive training of generative models. Unlike \cite{xu2024probabilistic}, which requires superlinear sample growth ($O(t^{1+s})$), our approach completely eliminates the dependence on increasing sample sizes within an unbiased estimation framework by designing a neural filter that learns to satisfy contraction conditions. We develop specialized neural network architectures and loss functions that enable the filter to actively learn contraction conditions satisfying Assumption 2.3 in exponential family distributions, thereby ensuring practical application of our theoretical results. Theoretical analysis demonstrates that when the learned contraction conditions are satisfied, estimation errors converge probabilistically even with constant sample sizes, i.e., $\limsup_{t\to\infty}\mathbb{P}(\|\mathbf{e}_t\|>δ)=0$ for any $δ>0$. Experimental results show that our neural network filter effectively learns contraction conditions and prevents model collapse under fixed sample size settings, providing an end-to-end solution for practical applications.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种结合政策感知生育函数、物理信息神经网络和LSTM的混合建模框架，用于预测印度2024-2054年的人口动态，分析了三种生育政策情景对年龄结构、抚养比和劳动力规模的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 印度等快速演变国家的人口预测对政策规划至关重要，但生育转变、政策干预和年龄结构动态之间存在复杂相互作用，传统方法难以准确捕捉这些关系，需要更先进的建模框架。

Result: 生育政策显著影响未来年龄分布、抚养比和劳动力规模：严格管控会加剧老龄化并减少劳动力参与，宽松政策支持劳动力增长但增加人口压力；LSTM-PINN混合方法在人口预测中表现出色。

Conclusion: 混合LSTM-PINN是有效的人口预测方法，兼具准确性和可解释性；研究为印度人口政策辩论提供了可行见解，强调需要平衡的生育干预以确保可持续的社会经济发展。

Abstract: Demographic forecasting remains a fundamental challenge for policy planning in rapidly evolving nations such as India, where fertility transitions, policy interventions, and age structured dynamics interact in complex ways. In this study, we present a hybrid modelling framework that integrates policy-aware fertility functions into a Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) enhanced with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to capture physical constraints and temporal dependencies in population dynamics. The model is applied to India's age structured population from 2024 to 2054 under three fertility-policy scenarios: continuation of current fertility decline, stricter population control, and relaxed fertility promotion. The governing transport-reaction partial differential equation is formulated with India-specific demographic indicators, including age-specific fertility and mortality rates. PINNs embed the core population equation and policy-driven fertility changes, while LSTM layers improve long-term forecasting across decades. Results show that fertility policies substantially shape future age distribution, dependency ratios, and workforce size. Stricter controls intensify ageing and reduce labour force participation, whereas relaxed policies support workforce growth but increase population pressure. Our findings suggest that the hybrid LSTM-PINN is an effective approach for demographic forecasting, offering accuracy with interpretability. Beyond methodological novelty, this work provides actionable insights for India's demographic policy debates, highlighting the need for balanced fertility interventions to ensure sustainable socio-economic development.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自适应优化方法（如Adam）在LLM预训练中表现出色，但现有理论基于损失函数的平滑性假设，这些假设在语言建模任务中的实际表现尚不明确。本文旨在直接从数据分布特性（重尾类别不平衡）分析ℓ∞-范数下降的优势。

Method: 提出了一个最小但具有代表性的下一个标记预测设置，在该设置中可以严格证明在存在重尾类别不平衡的情况下，坐标级算法（如符号下降）比归一化梯度下降收敛更快。

Result: 理论上证明了在重尾类别不平衡的数据分布下，符号下降（ℓ∞-范数下降）比归一化梯度下降（ℓ2-范数下降）具有更快的收敛速度。

Conclusion: 自适应优化方法的优势可以从数据分布特性（如重尾类别不平衡）来解释，而不仅仅是损失函数的平滑性假设。这为理解Adam等算法在语言建模中的成功提供了新的理论视角。

Abstract: Adaptive optimization methods (such as Adam) play a major role in LLM pretraining, significantly outperforming Gradient Descent (GD). Recent studies have proposed new smoothness assumptions on the loss function to explain the advantages of adaptive algorithms with structured preconditioners, e.g., coordinate-wise or layer-wise, and steepest descent methods w.r.t. non-euclidean norms, e.g., $\ell_\infty$ norm or spectral norm, over GD. However, it remains unclear how these smoothness assumptions manifest in language modelling tasks. In this work, we aim to analyze the benefit of $\ell_\infty$-norm descent (a.k.a. sign descent) directly from properties of the data distribution, namely, heavy-tailed class imbalance. We propose a minimal yet representative setting of next-token prediction, where we can provably show faster convergence of coordinate-wise algorithms such as Sign descent (steepest descent w.r.t. $\ell_\infty$ norm) over normalized GD (steepest descent w.r.t. to $\ell_2$ norm) in the presence of heavy tail class imbalance.

Abstract: The fast growth of digital health systems has led to a need to better comprehend how they interpret and represent patient-reported symptoms. Chatbots have been used in healthcare to provide clinical support and enhance the user experience, making it possible to provide meaningful clinical patterns from text-based data through chatbots. The proposed research utilises several different natural language processing methods to study the occurrences of symptom descriptions in medicine as well as analyse the patterns that emerge through these conversations within medical bots. Through the use of the Medical Conversations to Disease Dataset which contains 960 multi-turn dialogues divided into 24 Clinical Conditions, a standardised representation of conversations between patient and bot is created for further analysis by computational means. The multi-method approach uses a variety of tools, including Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to identify latent symptom themes, K-Means to group symptom descriptions by similarity, Transformer-based Named Entity Recognition (NER) to extract medical concepts, and the Apriori algorithm to discover frequent symptom pairs. Findings from the analysis indicate a coherent structure of clinically relevant topics, moderate levels of clustering cohesiveness and several high confidence rates on the relationships between symptoms like fever headache and rash itchiness. The results support the notion that conversational medical data can be a valuable diagnostic signal for early symptom interpretation, assist in strengthening decision support and improve how users interact with tele-health technology. By demonstrating a method for converting unstructured free-flowing dialogue into actionable knowledge regarding symptoms this work provides an extensible framework to further enhance future performance, dependability and clinical utility of selecting medical chatbots.

Motivation: 下一代大规模射电巡天（如SKA）中，源提取是关键任务。现有工具如SoFiA和Aegean需要复杂的参数配置优化，手动调参困难且耗时，需要自动化解决方案。

Method: 提出基于强化学习算法Soft Actor-Critic（SAC）的AI代理框架。代理通过与环境交互，根据SDC2评分反馈调整SoFiA参数，逐步学习优化参数配置。使用SKA科学数据挑战赛2（SDC2）数据集进行评估。

Conclusion: 该强化学习框架能有效解决复杂参数调优问题，不仅适用于射电巡天和源提取任务，还可扩展到其他类似问题。但需要包含代表性观测数据和真实星表的高质量训练集。

Abstract: Source extraction is crucial in analyzing data from next-generation, large-scale sky surveys in radio bands, such as the Square Kilometre Array (SKA). Several source extraction programs, including SoFiA and Aegean, have been developed to address this challenge. However, finding optimal parameter configurations when applying these programs to real observations is non-trivial. For example, the outcomes of SoFiA intensely depend on several key parameters across its preconditioning, source-finding, and reliability-filtering modules. To address this issue, we propose a framework to automatically optimize these parameters using an AI agent based on a state-of-the-art reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm, i.e., Soft Actor-Critic (SAC). The SKA Science Data Challenge 2 (SDC2) dataset is utilized to assess the feasibility and reliability of this framework. The AI agent interacts with the environment by adjusting parameters based on the feedback from the SDC2 score defined by the SDC2 Team, progressively learning to select parameter sets that yield improved performance. After sufficient training, the AI agent can automatically identify an optimal parameter configuration that outperform the benchmark set by Team SoFiA within only 100 evaluation steps and with reduced time consumption. Our approach could address similar problems requiring complex parameter tuning, beyond radio band surveys and source extraction. Yet, high-quality training sets containing representative observations and catalogs of ground truth are essential.

Motivation: 虽然DPO和PPO在LLM偏好优化中都很成功，但普遍认为DPO是监督学习而PPO是强化学习，这种差异背后的深层原因缺乏系统分析。论文旨在填补这一空白，深入理解两种方法的优化动态差异及其根本原因。

Method: 1. 分析梯度更新的目标方向：比较DPO的稳定目标和PPO的动态目标（平衡探索与利用）
2. 分析三个关键组件的作用：正学习、负学习和损失重加权
3. 通过精心设计的消融研究验证这些动态对优化效率和实际性能的影响

Result: 发现DPO和PPO在优化动态上存在本质差异：DPO的梯度更新遵循稳定目标，而PPO遵循动态目标以平衡探索与利用。在组件作用方面，DPO中正负学习共同塑造学习目标但相互抵消，损失重加权主要起正则化作用；PPO中负学习主要支持探索，损失重加权与token级优势绝对值相关，指示不同token组在更新目标中的不同作用。

Conclusion: 该研究不仅深化了对偏好优化方法的理解，还为开发更偏好对齐的LLM提供了新视角。分析揭示了DPO和PPO在优化动态上的根本差异，这些发现有助于指导未来偏好优化方法的设计和改进。

Abstract: Preference optimization (PO) is indispensable for large language models (LLMs), with methods such as direct preference optimization (DPO) and proximal policy optimization (PPO) achieving great success. A common belief is that DPO is supervised learning while PPO is reinforcement learning, yet deeper analyses for the reasons underlying these differences remain lacking. To fill this gap, we analyze their optimization dynamics, revealing distinct algorithmic behaviors and comprehending their underlying causes. First, we examine the target directions of gradient-based updates and find that DPO follows stable targets, whereas PPO follows dynamic targets that balance exploration and exploitation, thus validating the common belief from a new perspective. Second, we examine the roles of positive learning, negative learning, and loss reweighting, which are three key components in PO methods. Our analyses reveal that these components play fairly different roles. In DPO, positive and negative learning jointly shape the learning targets meanwhile mutually offset each other. However, loss reweighting in DPO acts less as a reward signal but more as a regularizer to mitigate overfitting. In PPO, negative learning primarily supports exploration rather than determining the targets. Meanwhile, loss reweighting, related to absolute values of token-level advantages, indicates the distinct roles of token groups in updating targets. Given these findings, we conduct carefully designed ablation studies to further examine how controlling these dynamics impacts optimization efficiency and practical performance. The insights gained from our analyses not only deepen the understanding of PO methods but also inspire the development of more preference-aligned LLMs.

*Libo Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 构建名为"Sigma"的VLA模型，在单张RTX 4090上训练，通过结合深度语义理解和关联的架构，实现人形机器人的思维响应式对齐控制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决人形机器人认知系统中缺乏可随时间更新的中介思维空间的问题，该空间应位于语义理解和连续控制之间。

Method: 基于开源pi05_base模型，预处理svla_so101_pickplace数据集，设计结合深度语义理解和关联的VLA架构，通过数据预处理、LoRA微调和推理阶段适配器的优化进行训练。

Result: Sigma在向量、片段和完整轨迹时间尺度上均表现出控制MSE的稳定下降，同时保持思维规范（telepathy norm）和语义-文本对齐质量不变。

Conclusion: 通过结合深度语义理解和关联的架构，无需重新训练基础模型即可实现思维响应式对齐控制，为人形机器人的语义对齐和意图驱动行为提供了可复现的经验。

Abstract: To address the gap in humanoid robot cognitive systems regarding the lack of a time-updable mediating thought space between semantics and continuous control, this study constructs and trains a VLA model named "Sigma" that runs on a single RTX 4090. It uses the open-source pi05_base model as a foundation and preprocesses svla_so101_pickplace into a training dataset. The researcher independently designed an architecture for a vision-language-action model that combines deep semantic understanding and association to achieve telepathic communication. The training process involved repeated optimizations of data preprocessing, LoRA fine-tuning, and the inference-stage adapter. The experiment employed offline closed-loop replay, comparing Sigma with the untuned pure pi05_base_base model under data conditions. Results showed that Sigma exhibited a stable decrease in control MSE across vector, fragment, and entire trajectory timescales, while maintaining the telepathy norm and semantic-text alignment quality unchanged. It demonstrates that mind-responsive alignment control is quantified through an architecture that combines deep understanding of semantics and association without retraining the base model, which provides reproducible experience for semantic alignment and intention-driven behavior in humanoid robots.

TL;DR: 研究发现训练分布与测试分布完全一致并不总是最优，存在单向函数时分布匹配可能不是最佳选择，但在目标函数具有特定规律且均匀分布情况下传统结论仍成立


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当训练数据和测试数据的分布不一致时，理解泛化问题变得复杂。本文探讨一个基本问题：训练分布是否总是应该与测试分布相同？

Method: 基于单向函数存在的假设进行理论分析，研究不同分布匹配情况下的泛化性能

Result: 令人惊讶的是，在单向函数存在的情况下，训练分布与测试分布完全一致并不总是最优选择，这与大多数学习方法的行为形成对比。但当目标函数具有特定规律且为均匀分布时，传统结论仍然成立

Conclusion: 分布匹配并非总是最优策略，这为机器学习中的分布偏移问题提供了新的理论视角，但在特定条件下传统方法仍然有效

Abstract: When the distributions of the training and test data do not coincide, the problem of understanding generalization becomes considerably more complex, prompting a variety of questions. In this work, we focus on a fundamental one: Is it always optimal for the training distribution to be identical to the test distribution? Surprisingly, assuming the existence of one-way functions, we find that the answer is no. That is, matching distributions is not always the best scenario, which contrasts with the behavior of most learning methods. Nonetheless, we also show that when certain regularities are imposed on the target functions, the standard conclusion is recovered in the case of the uniform distribution.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出一个框架来估计深度学习模型的内在维度，通过将全秩教师模型分解为不同秩的学生模型，使用知识蒸馏训练，根据性能确定有效秩区域和拐点。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度网络通常过度参数化，但学习到的表示往往具有低秩结构。需要一种系统方法来量化模型的内在维度，理解其表示能力的本质。

Method: 1) 训练全秩教师模型；2) 在不同秩上对权重进行分解；3) 通过知识蒸馏训练每个分解后的学生模型；4) 使用单调PCHIP插值拟合准确率-秩曲线；5) 定义有效秩区域（达到教师85-95%准确率的最小连续秩集）和有效拐点（最大化垂直距离的秩）。

Result: 在ViT-B/32微调于CIFAR-100的实验中，有效秩区域为[16, 34]，有效拐点在r* ~ 31。秩32的学生模型达到69.46%准确率（教师73.35%），约94.7%基线性能，同时实现显著参数压缩。

Conclusion: 提供了一个估计有效秩区域和拐点的通用框架，可作为量化深度模型内在维度的实用工具，有助于理解模型表示能力和设计更高效的架构。

Abstract: Deep networks are heavily over-parameterized, yet their learned representations often admit low-rank structure. We introduce a framework for estimating a model's intrinsic dimensionality by treating learned representations as projections onto a low-rank subspace of the model's full capacity. Our approach: train a full-rank teacher, factorize its weights at multiple ranks, and train each factorized student via distillation to measure performance as a function of rank.
  We define effective rank as a region, not a point: the smallest contiguous set of ranks for which the student reaches 85-95% of teacher accuracy. To stabilize estimates, we fit accuracy vs. rank with a monotone PCHIP interpolant and identify crossings of the normalized curve. We also define the effective knee as the rank maximizing perpendicular distance between the smoothed accuracy curve and its endpoint secant; an intrinsic indicator of where marginal gains concentrate.
  On ViT-B/32 fine-tuned on CIFAR-100 (one seed, due to compute constraints), factorizing linear blocks and training with distillation yields an effective-rank region of approximately [16, 34] and an effective knee at r* ~ 31. At rank 32, the student attains 69.46% top-1 accuracy vs. 73.35% for the teacher (~94.7% of baseline) while achieving substantial parameter compression. We provide a framework to estimate effective-rank regions and knees across architectures and datasets, offering a practical tool for characterizing the intrinsic dimensionality of deep models.

TL;DR: 提出Soft QD框架，避免离散化行为空间，并开发SQUAD算法，在标准基准测试中与SOTA方法竞争，同时在高维问题上具有更好可扩展性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统QD方法通过离散化行为空间来维持多样性，但在大规模解空间和高维行为空间中面临挑战：存储大量解不切实际，离散化因维度灾难而失效。

Method: 提出Soft QD框架，避免离散化需求；基于此框架开发可微分的QD算法SQUAD（Soft QD Using Approximated Diversity）。

Result: Soft QD框架具有单调性等理想特性，其极限行为与广泛使用的QD Score指标相关；SQUAD在标准基准测试中与当前SOTA方法竞争，在高维问题上展现更好的可扩展性。

Conclusion: Soft QD为QD优化提供了新的理论框架，避免了离散化的局限性，SQUAD算法在实际应用中表现出色，特别是在高维问题上的可扩展性优势。

Abstract: Quality-Diversity (QD) algorithms constitute a branch of optimization that is concerned with discovering a diverse and high-quality set of solutions to an optimization problem. Current QD methods commonly maintain diversity by dividing the behavior space into discrete regions, ensuring that solutions are distributed across different parts of the space. The QD problem is then solved by searching for the best solution in each region. This approach to QD optimization poses challenges in large solution spaces, where storing many solutions is impractical, and in high-dimensional behavior spaces, where discretization becomes ineffective due to the curse of dimensionality. We present an alternative framing of the QD problem, called \emph{Soft QD}, that sidesteps the need for discretizations. We validate this formulation by demonstrating its desirable properties, such as monotonicity, and by relating its limiting behavior to the widely used QD Score metric. Furthermore, we leverage it to derive a novel differentiable QD algorithm, \emph{Soft QD Using Approximated Diversity (SQUAD)}, and demonstrate empirically that it is competitive with current state of the art methods on standard benchmarks while offering better scalability to higher dimensional problems.

TL;DR: CCG框架通过因果发现与协作博弈理论结合，解决多标签分类中的标签不平衡、伪相关和分布偏移问题，显著提升稀有标签预测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多标签分类面临标签不平衡、伪相关和分布偏移等挑战，这些问题对稀有标签预测尤其不利，需要更鲁棒的方法来解决这些局限性。

Method: 提出因果协作博弈框架，将多标签分类建模为协作多玩家交互，结合神经结构方程模型进行显式因果发现，使用反事实好奇心奖励驱动鲁棒特征学习，加入因果不变性损失确保跨环境泛化，并针对稀有标签设计专门增强策略。

Result: 广泛基准测试表明，CCG在稀有标签预测和整体鲁棒性方面显著优于强基线方法，通过消融研究和定性分析验证了各组件有效性和可解释性。

Conclusion: 因果推理与协作博弈理论的协同作用在多标签学习领域具有重要潜力，CCG框架为解决标签不平衡和分布偏移问题提供了有效方案。

Abstract: Multi-label classification (MLC) remains vulnerable to label imbalance, spurious correlations, and distribution shifts, challenges that are particularly detrimental to rare label prediction. To address these limitations, we introduce the Causal Cooperative Game (CCG) framework, which conceptualizes MLC as a cooperative multi-player interaction. CCG unifies explicit causal discovery via Neural Structural Equation Models with a counterfactual curiosity reward to drive robust feature learning. Furthermore, it incorporates a causal invariance loss to ensure generalization across diverse environments, complemented by a specialized enhancement strategy for rare labels. Extensive benchmarking demonstrates that CCG substantially outperforms strong baselines in both rare label prediction and overall robustness. Through rigorous ablation studies and qualitative analysis, we validate the efficacy and interpretability of our components, underscoring the potential of synergizing causal inference with cooperative game theory for advancing multi-label learning.

TL;DR: ReJump是一个将大语言模型推理过程表示为树状节点访问顺序的框架，通过分析"跳跃"行为来量化推理风格，并可用于改进推理质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大型推理模型在数学和编程等挑战性任务上表现出色，但其底层的推理"算法"仍不明确。需要一种系统方法来分析和理解这些模型的推理行为模式。

Method: 提出ReJump框架，将推理轨迹表示为中间问题解决步骤树中节点的访问顺序。定义相邻移动（如计算）和非相邻移动（如回溯和验证）两种"跳跃"类型，并开发量化指标来分析探索、利用、过度思考、遗忘和验证等行为。

Result: 研究发现：1）准确率相似的模型可能表现出不同的推理行为；2）不同任务偏好不同的推理风格（如探索与利用的平衡）；3）ReJump可用于比较蒸馏模型与教师模型、CoT提示LLM与LRM的差异；4）ReJump能通过最佳N选择和提示选择策略改进推理质量。

Conclusion: ReJump提供了一个系统框架来分析大型推理模型的推理行为，揭示了不同模型和任务间的推理风格差异，并展示了如何利用这些分析来改进推理性能。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) are Large Language Models (LLMs) explicitly trained to generate long-form Chain-of-Thoughts (CoTs), achieving impressive success on challenging tasks like math and programming. However, their underlying reasoning "algorithms" remain poorly understood. To investigate this, we propose ReJump, which represents a reasoning trace as a visitation order over nodes in a tree of intermediate problem-solving steps. Transitions between nodes, which we term jumps, include adjacent moves that capture behaviors such as calculation, and non-adjacent moves that capture behaviors such as backtracking and verification. ReJump enables analyzing LLM reasoning with diverse metrics that quantify exploration, exploitation, overthinking, forgetting, and verification. Using our proposed LLM agent to extract reasoning traces into ReJump format, we evaluate state-of-the-art LRMs on two tasks and find that models with similar accuracy can exhibit distinct reasoning behaviors, while different tasks favor different reasoning styles (e.g., varying balance between exploration and exploitation). To further understand how learning strategies shape reasoning, we use ReJump to compare distilled LRMs with their teachers, CoT-prompted LLMs with LRMs, and to examine how the number of reasoning examples and reinforcement learning affect reasoning behavior. Finally, we show that ReJump can improve reasoning quality at test time through strategies such as ReJump-guided Best-of-N selection and prompt selection. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/UW-Madison-Lee-Lab/ReJump.

TL;DR: MCNF是一种新颖的后处理不确定性量化方法，可为深度回归模型同时提供预测区间和完整的条件预测分布，无需重新训练模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法存在两个主要问题：1）预测区间方法忽略了分布信息，无法处理多模态或非对称分布对决策的影响；2）贝叶斯方法虽然能提供预测后验密度，但需要对模型架构进行重大修改并重新训练。

Method: MCNF是一种后处理不确定性量化方法，在已训练好的预测模型之上运行，无需重新训练模型。它能够同时生成预测区间和完整的条件预测分布。

Result: 实验证明MCNF的不确定性估计具有良好的校准性，与最先进的不确定性量化方法具有竞争力，并为下游决策任务提供了更丰富的信息。

Conclusion: MCNF提供了一种有效的不确定性量化解决方案，既能保持预测模型的完整性，又能提供全面的分布信息，适用于高风险领域的决策制定。

Abstract: Quantifying uncertainty in deep regression models is important both for understanding the confidence of the model and for safe decision-making in high-risk domains. Existing approaches that yield prediction intervals overlook distributional information, neglecting the effect of multimodal or asymmetric distributions on decision-making. Similarly, full or approximated Bayesian methods, while yielding the predictive posterior density, demand major modifications to the model architecture and retraining. We introduce MCNF, a novel post hoc uncertainty quantification method that produces both prediction intervals and the full conditioned predictive distribution. MCNF operates on top of the underlying trained predictive model; thus, no predictive model retraining is needed. We provide experimental evidence that the MCNF-based uncertainty estimate is well calibrated, is competitive with state-of-the-art uncertainty quantification methods, and provides richer information for downstream decision-making tasks.

*Wenzhang Du*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: KTA v2：基于预测空间知识交易市场的联邦学习方法，通过共享logits而非模型参数，在低通信成本下实现高性能联邦学习


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦学习面临统计异构性和通信约束的挑战，特别是在非独立同分布数据和大型模型场景下。传统参数平均方法如FedAvg传输完整模型权重，在非IID数据下可能发散，且通信开销巨大。

Method: 提出两阶段知识交易市场：1）客户端在私有数据上本地训练，仅共享小公共参考集上的logits；2）服务器构建预测空间相似性图，结合参考集准确率形成个性化教师集成，返回软目标进行蒸馏更新。该方法可解释为具有预测空间正则化的统一目标的近似块坐标下降。

Result: 在FEMNIST、CIFAR-10和AG News数据集上，KTA v2在可比或更低的通信预算下，始终优于本地基线、参数方法（FedAvg、FedProx），并显著超越FedMD风格全局教师。在CIFAR-10上使用ResNet-18达到57.7%准确率，通信量仅为FedAvg的1/1100；在AG News上达到89.3%准确率，通信量约为FedAvg的1/300。

Conclusion: KTA v2通过预测空间知识交易有效解决了联邦学习中的统计异构性和通信瓶颈问题，在极低通信成本下实现了高性能，为大规模分布式多媒体数据协作学习提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables collaborative training over distributed multimedia data but suffers acutely from statistical heterogeneity and communication constraints, especially when clients deploy large models. Classic parameter-averaging methods such as FedAvg transmit full model weights and can diverge under nonindependent and identically distributed (non-IID) data. We propose KTA v2, a prediction-space knowledge trading market for FL. Each round, clients locally train on their private data, then share only logits on a small public reference set. The server constructs a client-client similarity graph in prediction space, combines it with reference-set accuracy to form per-client teacher ensembles, and sends back personalized soft targets for a second-stage distillation update. This two-stage procedure can be interpreted as approximate block-coordinate descent on a unified objective with prediction-space regularization. Experiments on FEMNIST, CIFAR-10 and AG News show that, under comparable or much lower communication budgets, KTA v2 consistently outperforms a local-only baseline and strong parameter-based methods (FedAvg, FedProx), and substantially improves over a FedMD-style global teacher. On CIFAR-10 with ResNet-18, KTA v2 reaches 57.7% test accuracy using approximately 1/1100 of FedAvg's communication, while on AG News it attains 89.3% accuracy with approximately 1/300 of FedAvg's traffic.

TL;DR: GFC提出了一种基于引力势场和拓扑持久性的联邦聚类方法，能在强LDP噪声下有效处理非IID数据，无需迭代通信。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的一步式联邦聚类方法在强LDP噪声和数据异构性下表现不佳，因为它们依赖不稳定的成对质心距离或邻域排名。需要一种能在不同LDP约束下有效处理非IID数据的隐私保护聚类方法。

Method: GFC将私有化的客户端质心转换为全局引力势场，其中真实聚类中心作为拓扑持久奇点出现。包含两个关键创新：(1)客户端紧凑感知扰动机制，将局部聚类几何编码为"质量"值；(2)服务器端拓扑聚合阶段，通过势场超水平集的持久同调分析提取稳定质心。

Result: 理论上建立了隐私预算ε与质心估计误差之间的闭式界限，证明势场的Lipschitz平滑特性在高密度区域指数抑制噪声。在10个基准测试中，特别是在强LDP约束下(ε<1)，GFC优于现有方法，同时在较低隐私预算下保持可比性能。

Conclusion: 通过将联邦聚类重新表述为合成物理启发空间中的拓扑持久性问题，GFC实现了前所未有的隐私-准确性权衡，无需迭代通信，为隐私保护分布式学习提供了新视角。

Abstract: Clustering non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) data under local differential privacy (LDP) in federated settings presents a critical challenge: preserving privacy while maintaining accuracy without iterative communication. Existing one-shot methods rely on unstable pairwise centroid distances or neighborhood rankings, degrading severely under strong LDP noise and data heterogeneity. We present Gravitational Federated Clustering (GFC), a novel approach to privacy-preserving federated clustering that overcomes the limitations of distance-based methods under varying LDP. Addressing the critical challenge of clustering non-IID data with diverse privacy guarantees, GFC transforms privatized client centroids into a global gravitational potential field where true cluster centers emerge as topologically persistent singularities. Our framework introduces two key innovations: (1) a client-side compactness-aware perturbation mechanism that encodes local cluster geometry as "mass" values, and (2) a server-side topological aggregation phase that extracts stable centroids through persistent homology analysis of the potential field's superlevel sets. Theoretically, we establish a closed-form bound between the privacy budget $ε$ and centroid estimation error, proving the potential field's Lipschitz smoothing properties exponentially suppress noise in high-density regions. Empirically, GFC outperforms state-of-the-art methods on ten benchmarks, especially under strong LDP constraints ($ε< 1$), while maintaining comparable performance at lower privacy budgets. By reformulating federated clustering as a topological persistence problem in a synthetic physics-inspired space, GFC achieves unprecedented privacy-accuracy trade-offs without iterative communication, providing a new perspective for privacy-preserving distributed learning.

TL;DR: CityCond：一个轻量级城市条件记忆层，可增强时空预测模型，通过城市ID编码和共享记忆库在不同数据条件下提升多城市部署性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多城市时空预测模型部署面临挑战：不同城市的交通网络规模、拓扑结构各异，数据可用性差异巨大，新城市可能只有短期历史数据。现有深度交通模型通常按城市和骨干网络单独训练，维护成本高且对数据稀缺城市迁移效果差。

Method: 提出CityCond轻量级城市条件记忆层，包含城市ID编码器和可选共享记忆库（CityMem）。给定城市索引和骨干网络隐藏状态，通过门控残差连接生成城市条件特征，可附加到多种时空骨干网络（GRU、TCN、Transformer、GNN、STGCN）。

Result: 在METR-LA、PEMS-BAY和SIND数据集上测试，CityCond在14个模型变体和3个随机种子下均带来一致改进，对高容量骨干网络（如Transformer和STGCN）提升最大。CityMem在完整数据设置中将Transformer误差降低约三分之一，在低数据和跨城市迁移中带来显著增益。

Conclusion: CityCond可作为可重用设计模式，在现实数据约束下实现可扩展的多城市预测，通过城市条件化提升模型在不同数据条件下的性能，支持更好的跨城市适应。

Abstract: Deploying spatio-temporal forecasting models across many cities is difficult: traffic networks differ in size and topology, data availability can vary by orders of magnitude, and new cities may provide only a short history of logs. Existing deep traffic models are typically trained per city and backbone, creating high maintenance cost and poor transfer to data-scarce cities. We ask whether a single, backbone-agnostic layer can condition on "which city this sequence comes from", improve accuracy in full- and low-data regimes, and support better cross-city adaptation with minimal code changes.
  We propose CityCond, a light-weight city-conditioned memory layer that augments existing spatio-temporal backbones. CityCond combines a city-ID encoder with an optional shared memory bank (CityMem). Given a city index and backbone hidden states, it produces city-conditioned features fused through gated residual connections. We attach CityCond to five representative backbones (GRU, TCN, Transformer, GNN, STGCN) and evaluate three regimes: full-data, low-data, and cross-city few-shot transfer on METR-LA and PEMS-BAY. We also run auxiliary experiments on SIND, a drone-based multi-agent trajectory dataset from a signalized intersection in Tianjin (we focus on pedestrian tracks).
  Across more than fourteen model variants and three random seeds, CityCond yields consistent improvements, with the largest gains for high-capacity backbones such as Transformers and STGCNs. CityMem reduces Transformer error by roughly one third in full-data settings and brings substantial gains in low-data and cross-city transfer. On SIND, simple city-ID conditioning modestly improves low-data LSTM performance. CityCond can therefore serve as a reusable design pattern for scalable, multi-city forecasting under realistic data constraints.

TL;DR: 该论文针对REFIT家庭用电数据集的概率预测问题，通过季节性插补方法处理数据缺口，系统评估了从经典模型到深度学习模型的性能，发现TFT模型在点预测和概率预测方面表现最佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 概率预测对现代风险管理至关重要，但REFIT家庭用电数据集存在结构性数据缺口和高度波动性，需要有效的插补方法和预测模型来处理这种复杂的时间序列数据。

Method: 首先通过对比实验选择季节性插补方法处理数据缺口，然后系统评估了SARIMA、Prophet、XGBoost、LSTM和TFT等多种模型，从经典基线到深度学习架构的层次化比较。

Result: 季节性插补优于线性插补；经典模型无法捕捉数据的非线性、状态切换行为；LSTM提供最校准的概率预测；TFT表现最佳，获得最低RMSE（481.94）并产生更安全、谨慎的预测区间，能有效捕捉极端波动。

Conclusion: TFT是处理复杂波动时间序列数据的最佳模型，在点预测准确性和概率预测安全性方面均表现优异，特别适合具有结构性数据缺口和极端波动的家庭用电预测场景。

Abstract: Probabilistic forecasting is essential for modern risk management, allowing decision-makers to quantify uncertainty in critical systems. This paper tackles this challenge using the volatile REFIT household dataset, which is complicated by a large structural data gap. We first address this by conducting a rigorous comparative experiment to select a Seasonal Imputation method, demonstrating its superiority over linear interpolation in preserving the data's underlying distribution. We then systematically evaluate a hierarchy of models, progressing from classical baselines (SARIMA, Prophet) to machine learning (XGBoost) and advanced deep learning architectures (LSTM). Our findings reveal that classical models fail to capture the data's non-linear, regime-switching behavior. While the LSTM provided the most well-calibrated probabilistic forecast, the Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT) emerged as the superior all-round model, achieving the best point forecast accuracy (RMSE 481.94) and producing safer, more cautious prediction intervals that effectively capture extreme volatility.

TL;DR: 论文研究了深度神经网络在初始化时的内在复杂性，通过NTK Gram矩阵的有效秩进行分析，证明了无限宽度极限下的常数定律和有限宽度稳定性，并设计了可扩展的估计器进行实验验证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代深度网络通常过度参数化但泛化良好，这表明存在一种不反映在参数数量上的低内在复杂性。作者旨在通过研究神经网络切线核（NTK）Gram矩阵的有效秩来量化这种复杂性，特别是在初始化阶段。

Method: 1. 理论分析：证明了在i.i.d.数据和无限宽度NTK下，有效秩收敛到一个常数极限；2. 有限宽度稳定性分析：证明了当有限宽度NTK与无限宽度NTK在算子范数上偏差为O_p(m^{-1/2})时，有效秩的变化也是O_p(m^{-1/2})；3. 设计可扩展估计器：使用随机输出探测和参数Jacobian的CountSketch方法，证明了条件无偏性和一致性。

Result: 1. 理论结果：建立了有效秩的常数极限定律和有限宽度稳定性；2. 实验验证：在CIFAR-10数据集上使用ResNet-20/56（宽度16/32）进行实验，观察到有效秩约为1.0-1.3，且随样本量n变化的斜率接近0，与理论一致；3. 核矩预测与拟合常数高度匹配。

Conclusion: 深度神经网络在初始化时表现出低内在复杂性，这可以通过NTK Gram矩阵的有效秩来量化。理论分析表明有效秩收敛到常数极限，且对有限宽度变化具有稳定性。实验验证了理论预测，表明即使在有限宽度网络中，有效秩也保持较小且对样本量不敏感。

Abstract: Modern deep networks are heavily overparameterized yet often generalize well, suggesting a form of low intrinsic complexity not reflected by parameter counts. We study this complexity at initialization through the effective rank of the Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) Gram matrix, $r_{\text{eff}}(K) = (\text{tr}(K))^2/\|K\|_F^2$. For i.i.d. data and the infinite-width NTK $k$, we prove a constant-limit law $\lim_{n\to\infty} \mathbb{E}[r_{\text{eff}}(K_n)] = \mathbb{E}[k(x, x)]^2 / \mathbb{E}[k(x, x')^2] =: r_\infty$, with sub-Gaussian concentration. We further establish finite-width stability: if the finite-width NTK deviates in operator norm by $O_p(m^{-1/2})$ (width $m$), then $r_{\text{eff}}$ changes by $O_p(m^{-1/2})$. We design a scalable estimator using random output probes and a CountSketch of parameter Jacobians and prove conditional unbiasedness and consistency with explicit variance bounds. On CIFAR-10 with ResNet-20/56 (widths 16/32) across $n \in \{10^3, 5\times10^3, 10^4, 2.5\times10^4, 5\times10^4\}$, we observe $r_{\text{eff}} \approx 1.0\text{--}1.3$ and slopes $\approx 0$ in $n$, consistent with the theory, and the kernel-moment prediction closely matches fitted constants.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: HBLLM是一种基于小波变换的1比特后训练量化方法，通过Haar小波分解增强表达能力，采用结构感知分组策略，在LLaMA2-13B上仅用1.08比特平均存储达到6.71困惑度。

Result: 在OPT和LLaMA模型上实验表明，HBLLM在1比特量化中达到最先进性能，在LLaMA2-13B上获得6.71困惑度，平均权重存储仅需1.08比特。

Conclusion: HBLLM通过小波增强和智能分组策略，实现了高保真度的1比特量化，为高效部署大语言模型提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: We introduce HBLLM, a wavelet-enhanced high-fidelity $1$-bit post-training quantization method for Large Language Models (LLMs). By leveraging Haar wavelet transforms to enhance expressive capacity through frequency decomposition, HBLLM significantly improves quantization fidelity while maintaining minimal overhead. This approach features two innovative structure-aware grouping strategies: (1) frequency-aware multi-parameter intra-row grouping and (2) $\ell_2$-norm-based saliency-driven column selection. For non-salient weights, a shared mean is employed across quantization groups within each frequency band to optimize storage efficiency. Experiments conducted on the OPT and LLaMA models demonstrate that HBLLM achieves state-of-the-art performance in $1$-bit quantization, attaining a perplexity of $6.71$ on LLaMA$2$-$13$B with an average weight storage of only $1.08$ bits.

TL;DR: 论文研究迭代式合成数据生成方法，通过主动学习策略动态选择训练样本，相比静态生成能更有效提升学生模型性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前语言模型能力提升通常通过使用更强大的"教师"模型生成合成数据来微调"学生"模型。大多数方法在训练前一次性生成所有合成数据，但本文认为在训练过程中动态生成数据可能更有效

Method: 采用迭代式闭环生成方法，根据学生模型当前状态指导数据生成。使用主动学习文献中的简单、低成本选择标准来动态选择训练样本，而不是复杂的LLM特定方法

Result: 在四个数学和逻辑推理数据集上使用四个不同的小语言模型验证，发现在固定生成样本预算或教师模型查询计算预算下，迭代式数据生成方法比静态生成方法能显著提升学生模型性能

Conclusion: 迭代式合成数据生成方法优于静态生成，且简单的主动学习选择标准比复杂的LLM特定方法更有效，为语言模型微调提供了更高效的数据生成策略

Abstract: A common and effective means for improving language model capabilities involves finetuning a ``student'' language model's parameters on generations from a more proficient ``teacher'' model. Termed ``synthetic data'', these generations are often produced before any student finetuning, but some work has considered generating new synthetic samples as training progresses. This paper studies and advocates for the latter case, where data are generated in an iterative, closed-loop fashion that is guided by the current state of the student model. For a fixed budget of generated samples, or a budget in terms of compute spent querying a teacher, we show that this curation of finetuning data affords improved student performance over static generation. Further, while there have been several LLM-specific methods proposed that operate in this regime, we find that simple, inexpensive selection criteria from the active learning literature tend to be most performant. We validate these claims across four mathematical and logical reasoning datasets using four different small language models.

TL;DR: 该研究对零样本基础模型在表格数据上的硬件开销进行了基准测试，发现树集成模型在多数数据集上性能相当或更好，且硬件需求远低于基础模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然零样本基础模型承诺无需训练即可处理表格数据，但其硬件开销（延迟、内存占用）尚未得到充分研究。需要量化评估这些模型在实际部署中的硬件效率。

Method: 在四个公开数据集（Adult-Income、Higgs-100k、Wine-Quality、California-Housing）上建立可复现的基准测试，测量测试精度、延迟时间、CPU RAM峰值和GPU VRAM峰值。比较两个开源基础模型（TabPFN-1.0和TabICL-base）与调优的XGBoost、LightGBM和随机森林基线。

Result: 树集成模型在三个数据集上精度等于或超过基础模型，且延迟≤0.40秒，内存≤150 MB，不使用VRAM。TabICL在Higgs数据集上精度提升0.8个百分点，但延迟增加约40,000倍（960秒），VRAM占用9 GB。TabPFN在Wine和Housing数据集上精度与树模型相当，但VRAM峰值达4 GB，且无法处理100k行的Higgs表。

Conclusion: 当前表格基础模型存在显著的硬件-精度权衡，树集成模型在多数情况下更高效。该基准为未来效率导向的研究提供了开放基线。

Abstract: Zero-shot foundation models (FMs) promise training-free prediction on tabular data, yet their hardware footprint remains poorly characterized. We present a fully reproducible benchmark that reports test accuracy together with wall-clock latency, peak CPU RAM, and peak GPU VRAM on four public datasets: Adult-Income, Higgs-100k, Wine-Quality, and California-Housing. Two open FMs (TabPFN-1.0 and TabICL-base) are compared against tuned XGBoost, LightGBM, and Random Forest baselines on a single NVIDIA T4 GPU. The tree ensembles equal or surpass FM accuracy on three datasets while completing full-test batches in <= 0.40 s and <= 150 MB RAM, using zero VRAM. TabICL achieves a 0.8 percentage-point gain on Higgs but requires roughly 40,000 times more latency (960 s) and 9 GB VRAM. TabPFN matches tree-model accuracy on Wine and Housing but peaks at 4 GB VRAM and cannot process the full 100k-row Higgs table. These results quantify the substantial hardware-versus-accuracy trade-offs in current tabular FMs and provide an open baseline for future efficiency-oriented research.

Method: 提出LESS框架，基于正确性感知对低熵段进行精细优势调节：增强正确响应特有段、抑制错误响应特有段、中和共享段，同时保持底层RL算法的高熵探索

Conclusion: 低熵段在推理中具有重要价值，LESS通过正确性感知的优势调节机制有效利用这些结构模式，显著提升了强化学习在语言模型推理任务中的性能

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has become a central approach for improving the reasoning ability of large language models. Recent work studies RLVR through token entropy, arguing that high-entropy tokens drive exploration and should receive stronger updates. However, they overlook the fact that most of a reasoning trajectory consists of low-entropy segments that encode stable and reusable structural patterns. Through qualitative and quantitative analyses, we find that the overlap of low-entropy segments across correct responses strongly correlates with model accuracy, while overlaps involving incorrect responses exhibit stable but unproductive patterns. Motivated by these findings, we propose LESS, a correctness-aware reinforcement framework that performs fine-grained advantage modulation over low-entropy segments. LESS amplifies segments unique to correct responses, suppresses those unique to incorrect ones, and neutralizes segments shared by both, while preserving high-entropy exploration in the underlying RL algorithm. Instantiated on top of the popular GRPO, LESS consistently improves accuracy over strong RL baselines across three backbones and six math benchmarks, achieves stronger robustness of the performance floor.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出部分群不变MDP框架，选择性应用群不变或标准Bellman备份，解决局部对称性破坏导致的全局值估计误差问题，提升样本效率和泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实环境几乎不会实现完全群不变的MDP，动力学、驱动限制和奖励设计通常会破坏对称性，且通常只是局部破坏。在群不变Bellman备份下，局部对称性破坏会引入误差并传播到整个状态-动作空间，导致全局值估计错误。

Method: 引入部分群不变MDP框架，根据对称性保持的位置选择性应用群不变或标准Bellman备份。基于此框架开发了PE-DQN（离散控制）和PE-SAC（连续控制）算法，结合等变性的优势与对对称性破坏的鲁棒性。

Result: 在Grid-World、运动控制和操作基准测试中，PE-DQN和PE-SAC显著优于基线方法，证明了选择性利用对称性对鲁棒和样本高效RL的重要性。

Conclusion: 部分群不变MDP框架通过选择性应用对称性，既能利用等变性的优势，又能避免局部对称性破坏导致的误差传播，实现了更鲁棒和样本高效的强化学习。

Abstract: Group symmetries provide a powerful inductive bias for reinforcement learning (RL), enabling efficient generalization across symmetric states and actions via group-invariant Markov Decision Processes (MDPs). However, real-world environments almost never realize fully group-invariant MDPs; dynamics, actuation limits, and reward design usually break symmetries, often only locally. Under group-invariant Bellman backups for such cases, local symmetry-breaking introduces errors that propagate across the entire state-action space, resulting in global value estimation errors. To address this, we introduce Partially group-Invariant MDP (PI-MDP), which selectively applies group-invariant or standard Bellman backups depending on where symmetry holds. This framework mitigates error propagation from locally broken symmetries while maintaining the benefits of equivariance, thereby enhancing sample efficiency and generalizability. Building on this framework, we present practical RL algorithms -- Partially Equivariant (PE)-DQN for discrete control and PE-SAC for continuous control -- that combine the benefits of equivariance with robustness to symmetry-breaking. Experiments across Grid-World, locomotion, and manipulation benchmarks demonstrate that PE-DQN and PE-SAC significantly outperform baselines, highlighting the importance of selective symmetry exploitation for robust and sample-efficient RL.

Abstract: Accurate Multivariate Time Series (MTS) forecasting is crucial for collaborative design of complex systems, Digital Twin building, and maintenance ahead of time. However, the collaborative industrial environment presents new challenges for MTS forecasting models: models should decouple complex inter-variable dependencies while addressing non-stationary distribution shift brought by environmental changes. To address these challenges and improve collaborative sensing reliability, we propose a Patch-Based Dual-Branch Channel-Temporal Forecasting Network (D-CTNet). Particularly, with a parallel dual-branch design incorporating linear temporal modeling layer and channel attention mechanism, our method explicitly decouples and jointly learns intra-channel temporal evolution patterns and dynamic multivariate correlations. Furthermore, a global patch attention fusion module goes beyond the local window scope to model long range dependencies. Most importantly, aiming at non-stationarity, a Frequency-Domain Stationarity Correction mechanism adaptively suppresses distribution shift impacts from environment change by spectrum alignment. Evaluations on seven benchmark datasets show that our model achieves better forecasting accuracy and robustness compared with state-of-the-art methods. Our work shows great promise as a new forecasting engine for industrial collaborative systems.

TL;DR: MIRA提出了一种结合联想记忆模块的统一框架，通过适配器调制实现领域泛化和持续学习的无缝集成，在两项任务上均取得SOTA性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生物系统能够毫秒级切换任务且不遗忘，这归因于神经调节剂（如多巴胺、乙酰胆碱）在单一神经回路上的动态叠加。而深度学习中的领域泛化（DG）和持续学习（CL）方法却相互隔离，缺乏生物系统的统一性。现有工作尚未探索利用联想记忆这种生物系统核心组件来联合解决这些任务。

Method: MIRA（Memory-Integrated Reconfigurable Adapters）在共享骨干网络上集成Hopfield风格的联想记忆模块。联想记忆键在训练后学习，能够基于每个样本索引和检索存储的适配器更新的仿射组合。通过仅改变任务特定目标，MIRA可在单一架构中无缝适应领域偏移和顺序任务暴露。

Result: 在标准基准测试中，MIRA显著提升了适应性和记忆保持能力：在领域泛化任务中达到SOTA的分布外准确率；在增量学习设置中，使用通用CL算法超越了专门设计处理灾难性遗忘的架构。

Conclusion: 通过将基于适配器的调制与生物启发的联想记忆相结合，MIRA在单一可扩展架构中实现了快速任务切换和持久知识保留，为开发更通用、记忆增强的AI系统指明了方向。

Abstract: Organisms constantly pivot between tasks such as evading predators, foraging, traversing rugged terrain, and socializing, often within milliseconds. Remarkably, they preserve knowledge of once-learned environments sans catastrophic forgetting, a phenomenon neuroscientists hypothesize, is due to a singular neural circuitry dynamically overlayed by neuromodulatory agents such as dopamine and acetylcholine. In parallel, deep learning research addresses analogous challenges via domain generalization (DG) and continual learning (CL), yet these methods remain siloed, despite the brains ability to perform them seamlessly. In particular, prior work has not explored architectures involving associative memories (AMs), which are an integral part of biological systems, to jointly address these tasks. We propose Memory-Integrated Reconfigurable Adapters (MIRA), a unified framework that integrates Hopfield-style associative memory modules atop a shared backbone. Associative memory keys are learned post-hoc to index and retrieve an affine combination of stored adapter updates for any given task or domain on a per-sample basis. By varying only the task-specific objectives, we demonstrate that MIRA seamlessly accommodates domain shifts and sequential task exposures under one roof. Empirical evaluations on standard benchmarks confirm that our AM-augmented architecture significantly enhances adaptability and retention: in DG, MIRA achieves SoTA out-of-distribution accuracy, and in incremental learning settings, it outperforms architectures explicitly designed to handle catastrophic forgetting using generic CL algorithms. By unifying adapter-based modulation with biologically inspired associative memory, MIRA delivers rapid task switching and enduring knowledge retention in a single extensible architecture, charting a path toward more versatile and memory-augmented AI systems.

Abstract: For patients undergoing systemic cancer therapy, the time between clinic visits is full of uncertainties and risks of unmonitored side effects. To bridge this gap in care, we developed and prospectively trialed a multi-modal AI framework for remote patient monitoring (RPM). This system integrates multi-modal data from the HALO-X platform, such as demographics, wearable sensors, daily surveys, and clinical events. Our observational trial is one of the largest of its kind and has collected over 2.1 million data points (6,080 patient-days) of monitoring from 84 patients. We developed and adapted a multi-modal AI model to handle the asynchronous and incomplete nature of real-world RPM data, forecasting a continuous risk of future adverse events. The model achieved an accuracy of 83.9% (AUROC=0.70). Notably, the model identified previous treatments, wellness check-ins, and daily maximum heart rate as key predictive features. A case study demonstrated the model's ability to provide early warnings by outputting escalating risk profiles prior to the event. This work establishes the feasibility of multi-modal AI RPM for cancer care and offers a path toward more proactive patient support.(Accepted at Europe NeurIPS 2025 Multimodal Representation Learning for Healthcare Workshop)

Motivation: 低比特量化是部署大语言模型的标准方法，但少数极端的权重和激活值会拉伸动态范围，降低量化器的有效分辨率。现有的固定正交变换（如哈达玛矩阵）忽略了数据统计特性，其最优性尚未得到理论证明。

Conclusion: 首次推导出针对标准数据无关量化器的闭式最优线性块变换，WUSH方法通过结合哈达玛变换和数据统计信息，在理论上可证明最优，并在实践中表现优于现有方法。

Abstract: Quantization to low bitwidth is a standard approach for deploying large language models, however, a few extreme weights and activations stretch the dynamic range and reduce the effective resolution of the quantizer. A common mitigation approach is to apply some fixed orthogonal transforms, such as Hadamard matrices, before quantization, which typically reduces the dynamic range. Yet, these transforms ignore the statistics of the data, and their optimality is currently not understood. In this work, we derive, for the first time, closed-form optimal linear blockwise transforms for joint weight-activation quantization using standard data-free quantizers for common numerical formats. Specifically, we provide derivations of the optimal adaptive (data-aware) transforms for round-to-nearest (RTN), AbsMax-scaled block quantizers for both integer and floating-point formats. The resulting construction, which we call WUSH, combines a Hadamard backbone with a data-dependent component based on second-order moments, yielding a non-orthogonal transform that is provably optimal under mild assumptions and remains structured for efficient implementation. Preliminary experimental results show that our approach consistently improves upon the Hadamard transform for common formats.

Conclusion: 通过利用预训练视频扩散模型的世界知识，能够为RL智能体提供目标驱动的奖励信号，无需人工设计奖励函数，实现了更连贯和目标驱动的轨迹

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has achieved remarkable success in various domains, yet it often relies on carefully designed programmatic reward functions to guide agent behavior. Designing such reward functions can be challenging and may not generalize well across different tasks. To address this limitation, we leverage the rich world knowledge contained in pretrained video diffusion models to provide goal-driven reward signals for RL agents without ad-hoc design of reward. Our key idea is to exploit off-the-shelf video diffusion models pretrained on large-scale video datasets as informative reward functions in terms of video-level and frame-level goals. For video-level rewards, we first finetune a pretrained video diffusion model on domain-specific datasets and then employ its video encoder to evaluate the alignment between the latent representations of agent's trajectories and the generated goal videos. To enable more fine-grained goal-achievement, we derive a frame-level goal by identifying the most relevant frame from the generated video using CLIP, which serves as the goal state. We then employ a learned forward-backward representation that represents the probability of visiting the goal state from a given state-action pair as frame-level reward, promoting more coherent and goal-driven trajectories. Experiments on various Meta-World tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

Motivation: 超声心动图数据集可用于训练深度学习模型自动化解读心脏超声，但现有数据集缺乏患者性别、种族、民族等人口统计学信息报告，且未评估亚组特异性预测性能，这引发了模型部署前亚组有效性的担忧。

Method: 1) 改进TMED-2和MIMIC-IV-ECHO两个数据集的社会人口统计学报告；2) 分析六个开放数据集的人口统计学覆盖情况；3) 在TMED-2数据集上对两个已发表的主动脉瓣狭窄检测模型进行探索性亚组分析。

Abstract: Echocardiogram datasets enable training deep learning models to automate interpretation of cardiac ultrasound, thereby expanding access to accurate readings of diagnostically-useful images. However, the gender, sex, race, and ethnicity of the patients in these datasets are underreported and subgroup-specific predictive performance is unevaluated. These reporting deficiencies raise concerns about subgroup validity that must be studied and addressed before model deployment. In this paper, we show that current open echocardiogram datasets are unable to assuage subgroup validity concerns. We improve sociodemographic reporting for two datasets: TMED-2 and MIMIC-IV-ECHO. Analysis of six open datasets reveals no consideration of gender-diverse patients and insufficient patient counts for many racial and ethnic groups. We further perform an exploratory subgroup analysis of two published aortic stenosis detection models on TMED-2. We find insufficient evidence for subgroup validity for sex, racial, and ethnic subgroups. Our findings highlight that more data for underrepresented subgroups, improved demographic reporting, and subgroup-focused analyses are needed to prove subgroup validity in future work.

Abstract: Neural oscillators, originating from the second-order ordinary differential equations (ODEs), have demonstrated competitive performance in stably learning causal mappings between long-term sequences or continuous temporal functions. However, theoretically quantifying the capacities of their neural network architectures remains a significant challenge. In this study, the neural oscillator consisting of a second-order ODE followed by a multilayer perceptron (MLP) is considered. Its upper approximation bound for approximating causal and uniformly continuous operators between continuous temporal function spaces and that for approximating uniformly asymptotically incrementally stable second-order dynamical systems are derived. The established proof method of the approximation bound for approximating the causal continuous operators can also be directly applied to state-space models consisting of a linear time-continuous complex recurrent neural network followed by an MLP. Theoretical results reveal that the approximation error of the neural oscillator for approximating the second-order dynamical systems scales polynomially with the reciprocals of the widths of two utilized MLPs, thus mitigating the curse of parametric complexity. The decay rates of two established approximation error bounds are validated through two numerical cases. These results provide a robust theoretical foundation for the effective application of the neural oscillator in science and engineering.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决联邦学习中的异构性、严格通信计算限制和隐私保护问题，同时确保性能，提供数学上可证明的替代方案

Result: 在四个基准测试中，梯度无关FL方法匹配或优于基于梯度的微调，增益高达23.7分；差分隐私实验中核平滑缓解高隐私制度下的精度损失；全局规则支持FHE实现

Conclusion: 该框架提供可证明的保证、低通信开销、通过标量摘要支持隐私知识传输，并产生FHE兼容的预测规则，为异构联邦学习提供数学基础

Abstract: Federated learning must address heterogeneity, strict communication and computation limits, and privacy while ensuring performance. We propose an operator-theoretic framework that maps the $L^2$-optimal solution into a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) via a forward operator, approximates it using available data, and maps back with the inverse operator, yielding a gradient-free scheme. Finite-sample bounds are derived using concentration inequalities over operator norms, and the framework identifies a data-dependent hypothesis space with guarantees on risk, error, robustness, and approximation. Within this space we design efficient kernel machines leveraging the space folding property of Kernel Affine Hull Machines. Clients transfer knowledge via a scalar space folding measure, reducing communication and enabling a simple differentially private protocol: summaries are computed from noise-perturbed data matrices in one step, avoiding per-round clipping and privacy accounting. The induced global rule requires only integer minimum and equality-comparison operations per test point, making it compatible with fully homomorphic encryption (FHE). Across four benchmarks, the gradient-free FL method with fixed encoder embeddings matches or outperforms strong gradient-based fine-tuning, with gains up to 23.7 points. In differentially private experiments, kernel smoothing mitigates accuracy loss in high-privacy regimes. The global rule admits an FHE realization using $Q \times C$ encrypted minimum and $C$ equality-comparison operations per test point, with operation-level benchmarks showing practical latencies. Overall, the framework provides provable guarantees with low communication, supports private knowledge transfer via scalar summaries, and yields an FHE-compatible prediction rule offering a mathematically grounded alternative to gradient-based federated learning under heterogeneity.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种无监督方法来分析果蝠发声的离散性、句法和时间结构，发现果蝠通信系统具有关联性句法、上下文依赖的音节使用，以及在冲突情境下表现出更高的通信复杂性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究果蝠分级发声系统作为案例，评估通信模式复杂性及其与行为情境的关系，旨在理解动物通信系统的结构特征。

Method: 使用流形学习改进无监督音节标记，通过梅尔频谱图降维分析；将发声编码为音节序列分析句法类型；提取最大重复模式评估句法结构；分析音节转移网络。

Result: 发现：1) 关联性句法而非组合性句法；2) 上下文依赖的音节使用；3) 最大重复模式呈重尾分布（截断幂律，指数α<2），表明组合复杂性编码机制。母子互动以重复为特征，冲突情境下的通信比非对抗情境更复杂。

Conclusion: 果蝠通信系统在分歧情境下表现出更高的复杂性，反映了信息压缩性较低，表明通信复杂性随社会情境变化而变化。

Abstract: This study presents an unsupervised method to infer discreteness, syntax and temporal structures of fruit-bats vocalizations, as a case study of graded vocal systems, and evaluates the complexity of communication patterns in relation with behavioral context. The method improved the baseline for unsupervised labeling of vocal units (i.e. syllables) through manifold learning, by investigating how dimen- sionality reduction on mel-spectrograms affects labeling, and comparing it with unsupervised labels based on acoustic similarity. We then encoded vocalizations as syllabic sequences to analyze the type of syntax, and extracted the Maximal Repetitions (MRs) to evaluate syntactical structures. We found evidence for: i) associative syntax, rather than combinatorial (context classification is unaffected by permutation of sequences, F 1 > 0.9); ii) context-dependent use of syllables (Wilcoxon rank-sum tests, p-value < 0.05); iii) heavy-tail distribution of MRs (truncated power-law, exponent α < 2), indicative of mechanism encoding com- binatorial complexity. Analysis of MRs and syllabic transition networks revealed that mother-pupil interactions were characterized by repetitions, while commu- nication in conflict-contexts exhibited higher complexity (longer MRs and more interconnected vocal sequences) than non-agonistic contexts. We propose that communicative complexity is higher in scenarios of disagreement, reflecting lower compressibility of information.

*Mansi Maheshwari,John C. Raisbeck,Bruno Castro da Silva*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: AltNet：一种基于重置的双网络方法，通过交替角色恢复神经网络在强化学习中的可塑性，避免性能下降


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 神经网络在强化学习中会出现可塑性损失，传统重置方法虽然能恢复可塑性但会导致性能暂时下降，这在安全关键环境中很危险

Method: 使用双网络架构，一个网络在环境中主动学习，另一个网络从主动网络的交互和回放缓冲区中离线学习，定期交替角色并重置主动网络

Result: 在DeepMind Control Suite的高维控制任务中，AltNet恢复了可塑性，提高了样本效率，获得了更高性能，且避免了性能下降

Conclusion: AltNet通过双网络交替重置机制，有效解决了强化学习中的可塑性损失问题，在保持性能稳定的同时提升了学习能力

Abstract: Neural networks have shown remarkable success in supervised learning when trained on a single task using a fixed dataset. However, when neural networks are trained on a reinforcement learning task, their ability to continue learning from new experiences declines over time. This decline in learning ability is known as plasticity loss. To restore plasticity, prior work has explored periodically resetting the parameters of the learning network, a strategy that often improves overall performance. However, such resets come at the cost of a temporary drop in performance, which can be dangerous in real-world settings. To overcome this instability, we introduce AltNet, a reset-based approach that restores plasticity without performance degradation by leveraging twin networks. The use of twin networks anchors performance during resets through a mechanism that allows networks to periodically alternate roles: one network learns as it acts in the environment, while the other learns off-policy from the active network's interactions and a replay buffer. At fixed intervals, the active network is reset and the passive network, having learned from prior experiences, becomes the new active network. AltNet restores plasticity, improving sample efficiency and achieving higher performance, while avoiding performance drops that pose risks in safety-critical settings. We demonstrate these advantages in several high-dimensional control tasks from the DeepMind Control Suite, where AltNet outperforms various relevant baseline methods, as well as state-of-the-art reset-based techniques.

<details>

Motivation: 当前时间序列基础模型（TSFMs）与任务特定编码器、解码器和适配器结合的管道通常需要特定的、模型特定的实现，这阻碍了模块化和可重复性。

Method: 开发FMTK工具包，提供标准化的骨干网络和组件抽象，使研究人员能够灵活地跨模型和任务组合不同的组件，只需平均7行代码即可实现正确性和性能。

Conclusion: FMTK作为一个开源工具包，解决了TSFM管道构建中的模块化和可重复性问题，为时间序列机器学习研究提供了更高效的工作流程。

Abstract: Foundation models (FMs) have opened new avenues for machine learning applications due to their ability to adapt to new and unseen tasks with minimal or no further training. Time-series foundation models (TSFMs) -- FMs trained on time-series data -- have shown strong performance on classification, regression, and imputation tasks. Recent pipelines combine TSFMs with task-specific encoders, decoders, and adapters to improve performance; however, assembling such pipelines typically requires ad hoc, model-specific implementations that hinder modularity and reproducibility. We introduce FMTK, an open-source, lightweight and extensible toolkit for constructing and fine-tuning TSFM pipelines via standardized backbone and component abstractions. FMTK enables flexible composition across models and tasks, achieving correctness and performance with an average of seven lines of code. https://github.com/umassos/FMTK

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出Adaptive-lambda SISS方法，通过动态推断混合权重lambda来改进机器遗忘，相比固定lambda的方法能更好地平衡遗忘与保留性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有机器遗忘方法（如Static-lambda SISS）使用固定混合权重lambda，但实际所需的遗忘强度因样本和训练阶段而异，导致次优性能。需要更灵活的方法来适应不同遗忘需求。

Method: 提出Adaptive-lambda SISS，将lambda变为潜在变量，通过轻量级推理网络动态推断。基于SISS损失项（保留/遗忘损失及其梯度）的上下文特征参数化自适应后验分布，通过变分目标联合优化扩散模型和lambda推理机制。

Result: 在增强的MNIST基准测试中，Adaptive-lambda SISS显著优于原始Static-lambda SISS，在更好地保留保留集生成质量的同时，实现了对遗忘类别更强的移除效果。

Conclusion: 自适应lambda方法为机器遗忘提供了更优的权衡，可扩展到基于分数的遗忘蒸馏，并提出了混合目标和强化学习等新方向，为生成模型的合规遗忘提供了更有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Machine Unlearning is essential for large generative models (VAEs, DDPMs) to comply with the right to be forgotten and prevent undesired content generation without costly retraining. Existing approaches, such as Static-lambda SISS for diffusion models, rely on a fixed mixing weight lambda, which is suboptimal because the required unlearning strength varies across samples and training stages.
  We propose Adaptive-lambda SISS, a principled extension that turns lambda into a latent variable dynamically inferred at each training step. A lightweight inference network parameterizes an adaptive posterior over lambda, conditioned on contextual features derived from the instantaneous SISS loss terms (retain/forget losses and their gradients). This enables joint optimization of the diffusion model and the lambda-inference mechanism via a variational objective, yielding significantly better trade-offs.
  We further extend the adaptive-lambda principle to score-based unlearning and introduce a multi-class variant of Score Forgetting Distillation. In addition, we present two new directions: (i) a hybrid objective combining the data-free efficiency of Score Forgetting Distillation with the direct gradient control of SISS, and (ii) a Reinforcement Learning formulation that treats unlearning as a sequential decision process, learning an optimal policy over a state space defined by the model's current memory of the forget set.
  Experiments on an augmented MNIST benchmark show that Adaptive-lambda SISS substantially outperforms the original static-lambda SISS, achieving stronger removal of forgotten classes while better preserving generation quality on the retain set.

TL;DR: 提出PIANO模型，通过物理约束的神经网络算子结合生成模型，实现基于卫星图像的降水临近预报，提升中度和短时强降水预测精度


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前降水临近预报方法计算成本高、限制多，许多国家难以获得。需要开发更准确、物理一致且可访问的预报方法

Method: 使用物理信息双神经算子(PIANO)结构，在训练中通过PINN损失强制实施平流扩散基本方程来预测卫星图像，然后使用生成模型将卫星图像转换为雷达图像用于降水预报

Result: 相比基线模型，在中度降水(4mm/h)和短时强降水(8mm/h)事件预测方面有显著改进，预测季节性变化小，表明泛化鲁棒性好

Conclusion: PIANO模型展示了物理信息降水临近预报的潜力，为相关研究提供了良好基准

Abstract: Precipitation nowcasting, key for early warning of disasters, currently relies on computationally expensive and restrictive methods that limit access to many countries. To overcome this challenge, we propose precipitation nowcasting using satellite imagery with physics constraints for improved accuracy and physical consistency. We use a novel physics-informed dual neural operator (PIANO) structure to enforce the fundamental equation of advection-diffusion during training to predict satellite imagery using a PINN loss. Then, we use a generative model to convert satellite images to radar images, which are used for precipitation nowcasting. Compared to baseline models, our proposed model shows a notable improvement in moderate (4mm/h) precipitation event prediction alongside short-term heavy (8mm/h) precipitation event prediction. It also demonstrates low seasonal variability in predictions, indicating robustness for generalization. This study suggests the potential of the PIANO and serves as a good baseline for physics-informed precipitation nowcasting.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出基于贝叶斯网络的动态调度方法，用于处理多用途批处理过程中的扰动，相比传统周期性重调度方法能降低长期成本和系统波动。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多用途批处理过程在动态环境中面临处理延迟和需求变化等扰动，现有方法假设完全的前瞻信息，而实际只能获得不完整信息，导致长期成本次优和系统波动高。

Method: 提出贝叶斯动态调度方法：从扰动概率分布学习贝叶斯网络，表示每个操作受扰动影响的可能性；在线执行时根据观测到的新扰动更新后验分布，指导重调度策略。

Result: 在四个基准问题上与现有周期性重调度策略比较，计算结果显示该方法在长期成本和系统波动方面统计显著更优；理论上证明若扰动相互独立，影响量化变量满足贝叶斯网络独立性假设。

Conclusion: 该方法能有效处理动态环境中的扰动，降低长期成本和系统波动；可扩展到其他调度问题（如作业车间调度和连续过程），只要定义问题特定的操作间依赖关系。

Abstract: Multipurpose batch processes become increasingly popular in manufacturing industries since they adapt to low-volume, high-value products and shifting demands. These processes often operate in a dynamic environment, which faces disturbances such as processing delays and demand changes. To minimise long-term cost and system nervousness (i.e., disruptive changes to schedules), schedulers must design rescheduling strategies to address such disturbances effectively. Existing methods often assume complete look-ahead information over the scheduling horizon. This assumption contrasts with realistic situations where schedulers can only access incomplete look-ahead information. Sticking with existing methods may lead to suboptimal long-term costs and high-level system nervousness. In this work we propose a Bayesian dynamic scheduling method. Our method relies on learning a Bayesian Network from the probability distribution of disturbances. Specifically, the Bayesian Network represents how likely each operation will be impacted by disturbances. During the online execution, when new disturbances become observed, this method updates the posterior distribution and therefore guides the rescheduling strategy. We compare our method with the existing periodic rescheduling strategy (which generates new schedules from scratch at fixed intervals) on four benchmark problems. Computational results show that our method achieves statistically better long-term costs and system nervousness. In the theoretical aspect, we prove that if disturbances are mutually independent, the impact-quantifying variables inherently satisfy the independence assumptions required by Bayesian Networks. As an implication, practitioners can extend the method to other scheduling problems (such as job shop scheduling and continuous processes), given that they define the problem-specific dependencies between operations.

TL;DR: 提出AutoBRANE算法，通过高效搜索最优分支结构解决多任务算法推理中的负干扰问题，在多种基准测试中显著提升性能并降低计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多任务算法推理中，不同算法的执行步骤差异导致训练时产生负干扰，需要设计能够同时处理多个算法推理任务的单一模型架构。

Method: 提出分支神经网络架构，开发AutoBRANE算法，通过凸松弛近似最优任务划分，使用基于梯度的亲和度分数聚类任务，搜索复杂度从指数级降低到线性。

Result: 在CLRS基准上比最强单多任务GNN提升3.7%，比最佳基线提升1.2%，运行时减少48%，内存使用减少26%；在文本图推理基准上提升3.2%；在大规模图数据集上准确率提升28%，运行时减少4.5倍。

Conclusion: AutoBRANE能够高效学习合理的任务层次聚类结构，显著提升多任务算法推理性能，同时大幅降低计算成本，适用于GNN和LLM等多种基础模型。

Abstract: Algorithmic reasoning -- the ability to perform step-by-step logical inference -- has become a core benchmark for evaluating reasoning in graph neural networks (GNNs) and large language models (LLMs). Ideally, one would like to design a single model capable of performing well on multiple algorithmic reasoning tasks simultaneously. However, this is challenging when the execution steps of algorithms differ from one another, causing negative interference when they are trained together.
  We propose branching neural networks, a principled architecture for multitask algorithmic reasoning. Searching for the optimal $k$-ary tree with $L$ layers over $n$ algorithmic tasks is combinatorial, requiring exploration of up to $k^{nL}$ possible structures. We develop AutoBRANE, an efficient algorithm that reduces this search to $O(nL)$ time by solving a convex relaxation at each layer to approximate an optimal task partition. The method clusters tasks using gradient-based affinity scores and can be used on top of any base model, including GNNs and LLMs.
  We validate AutoBRANE on a broad suite of graph-algorithmic and text-based reasoning benchmarks. We show that gradient features estimate true task performance within 5% error across four GNNs and four LLMs (up to 34B parameters). On the CLRS benchmark, it outperforms the strongest single multitask GNN by 3.7% and the best baseline by 1.2%, while reducing runtime by 48% and memory usage by 26%. The learned branching structures reveal an intuitively reasonable hierarchical clustering of related algorithms. On three text-based graph reasoning benchmarks, AutoBRANE improves over the best non-branching multitask baseline by 3.2%. Finally, on a large graph dataset with 21M edges and 500 tasks, AutoBRANE achieves a 28% accuracy gain over existing multitask and branching architectures, along with a 4.5$\times$ reduction in runtime.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出WISER算法，利用世界模型的"惊讶度"度量来减少噪声影响，通过拒绝采样技术在多传感器和单传感器故障场景中保持强化学习智能体的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界部署的AI系统面临各种干扰和分布外噪声，这些噪声会破坏策略稳定性并导致不安全行为。虽然鲁棒训练可以减少对某些噪声的敏感性，但无法预见所有可能的OOD条件。

Method: 开发WISER算法，利用世界模型固有的"惊讶度"度量来减少噪声影响。引入多表示和单表示拒绝采样技术，分别处理多传感器故障和单传感器故障场景。

Result: 在CARLA和Safety Gymnasium等自动驾驶仿真环境中，WISER方法在不同类型和水平的噪声下保持性能，优于基线方法。该方法还能增强两种架构迥异的世界模型（Cosmos和DreamerV3）的稳定性。

Conclusion: WISER算法通过利用世界模型的惊讶度度量，有效提高了基于世界模型的强化学习智能体对噪声的鲁棒性，在不同世界建模领域都表现出良好的适应性。

Abstract: AI systems deployed in the real world must contend with distractions and out-of-distribution (OOD) noise that can destabilize their policies and lead to unsafe behavior. While robust training can reduce sensitivity to some forms of noise, it is infeasible to anticipate all possible OOD conditions. To mitigate this issue, we develop an algorithm that leverages a world model's inherent measure of surprise to reduce the impact of noise in world model--based reinforcement learning agents. We introduce both multi-representation and single-representation rejection sampling, enabling robustness to settings with multiple faulty sensors or a single faulty sensor. While the introduction of noise typically degrades agent performance, we show that our techniques preserve performance relative to baselines under varying types and levels of noise across multiple environments within self-driving simulation domains (CARLA and Safety Gymnasium). Furthermore, we demonstrate that our methods enhance the stability of two state-of-the-art world models with markedly different underlying architectures: Cosmos and DreamerV3. Together, these results highlight the robustness of our approach across world modeling domains. We release our code at https://github.com/Bluefin-Tuna/WISER .

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 并行采样在测试时扩展中具有巨大潜力，但其有效性受到多样性崩溃的严重限制，模型集中在少数模式上，重复采样产生相同错误。

Method: 提出模式条件化（ModC）框架，使用专家模型或模式特定前缀显式分配测试时计算到不同推理模式，并通过梯度聚类实现无需显式模式标签的ModC。

Result: ModC在控制图搜索任务和大规模推理基准测试中一致改善扩展性，在OpenThoughts上实现4倍效率提升，在NuminaMath上获得10%增益，并能增强强化学习方法。

Conclusion: 标准训练未充分利用数据多样性，ModC提供简单有效的解决方案，释放测试时扩展中多样性的全部潜力。

Abstract: Parallel sampling promises substantial gains in test-time scaling, but its effectiveness is sharply limited by diversity collapse, where models concentrate on a few modes and repeated samples produce the same mistakes. We propose the mode-conditioning (ModC) framework, which explicitly allocates test-time compute across reasoning modes using either specialist models or mode-specific prefixes. ModC consistently improves scaling across controlled graph-search tasks and large-scale reasoning benchmarks, spanning model families and sizes from 0.5B to 7B. On OpenThoughts, fine-tuning Qwen2.5-7B with ModC achieves a 4x efficiency gain over standard training while also improving the maximum attainable Pass@k. We further show that gradient clustering enables ModC without explicit mode labels, yielding up to 10% gains on datasets such as NuminaMath. Finally, we show that ModC improves reinforcement learning (RL) and can further boost diversity-inducing RL methods. These results demonstrate that standard training underutilizes the diversity in data, and that ModC provides a simple, effective remedy for unlocking the full benefits of diversity in test-time scaling.

TL;DR: 该研究探讨了Frank-Wolfe优化方法在卷积神经网络剪枝中的应用，发现带动量的FW方法能在少量预训练后获得更稀疏且更准确的网络。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机源于"彩票假设"，该假设认为在大型预训练网络中存在性能相当甚至更好的小型子网络。大多数相关研究关注通用深度神经网络，而本研究专门针对图像分类任务的卷积神经网络。

Method: 研究比较了三种剪枝方法：简单的基于幅度的剪枝、Frank-Wolfe风格的剪枝方案，以及带动量的FW方法。在MNIST数据集上训练CNN，并跟踪测试准确率、损失、稀疏度和推理时间，同时将密集预训练预算从1到10个epoch进行变化。

Result: 带动量的FW方法产生的剪枝网络比原始密集模型和简单剪枝基线更稀疏且更准确，同时推理时间开销最小。此外，带动量的FW方法仅需几个epoch的预训练就能达到这些准确率，表明在此设置下不需要完整的密集模型预训练。

Conclusion: Frank-Wolfe优化方法，特别是带动量的版本，为卷积神经网络剪枝提供了一种有效方法，能够在少量预训练后获得高性能的稀疏网络，验证了彩票假设在CNN剪枝中的适用性。

Abstract: We investigate algorithmic variants of the Frank-Wolfe (FW) optimization method for pruning convolutional neural networks. This is motivated by the "Lottery Ticket Hypothesis", which suggests the existence of smaller sub-networks within larger pre-trained networks that perform comparatively well (if not better). Whilst most literature in this area focuses on Deep Neural Networks more generally, we specifically consider Convolutional Neural Networks for image classification tasks. Building on the hypothesis, we compare simple magnitude-based pruning, a Frank-Wolfe style pruning scheme, and an FW method with momentum on a CNN trained on MNIST. Our experiments track test accuracy, loss, sparsity, and inference time as we vary the dense pre-training budget from 1 to 10 epochs. We find that FW with momentum yields pruned networks that are both sparser and more accurate than the original dense model and the simple pruning baselines, while incurring minimal inference-time overhead in our implementation. Moreover, FW with momentum reaches these accuracies after only a few epochs of pre-training, indicating that full pre-training of the dense model is not required in this setting.

TL;DR: 提出了首个适用于所有有限p≥1的lp范数的可解释k-medians聚类算法，实现了O(p(log k)^{1 + 1/p - 1/p^2})近似比，并提供了动态维护版本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的可解释k-medians聚类算法仅适用于p=1和p=2的情况，需要扩展到更一般的lp范数，同时需要支持动态数据集更新。

Method: 设计阈值决策树算法，每个内部节点通过阈值化单个特征进行决策，构建可解释的聚类划分。算法扩展到所有有限p≥1的lp范数，并实现了动态版本支持插入删除操作。

Result: 算法实现了O(p(log k)^{1 + 1/p - 1/p^2})的近似比，对于p=2改进了现有的O(log^{3/2}k)界限，对于p=1接近紧界log k + O(1)。动态版本具有摊销更新时间O(d log^3 k)和O(log k)调整代价。

Conclusion: 该工作首次解决了所有有限p≥1的可解释k-medians聚类问题，提供了理论保证和实用的动态实现，适用于大规模和演化数据集的可解释聚类分析。

Abstract: We study the problem of explainable k-medians clustering introduced by Dasgupta, Frost, Moshkovitz, and Rashtchian (2020). In this problem, the goal is to construct a threshold decision tree that partitions data into k clusters while minimizing the k-medians objective. These trees are interpretable because each internal node makes a simple decision by thresholding a single feature, allowing users to trace and understand how each point is assigned to a cluster. We present the first algorithm for explainable k-medians under lp norm for every finite p >= 1. Our algorithm achieves an O(p(log k)^{1 + 1/p - 1/p^2}) approximation to the optimal k-medians cost for any p >= 1. Previously, algorithms were known only for p = 1 and p = 2. For p = 2, our algorithm improves upon the existing bound of O(log^{3/2}k), and for p = 1, it matches the tight bound of log k + O(1) up to a multiplicative O(log log k) factor. We show how to implement our algorithm in a dynamic setting. The dynamic algorithm maintains an explainable clustering under a sequence of insertions and deletions, with amortized update time O(d log^3 k) and O(log k) recourse, making it suitable for large-scale and evolving datasets.

Motivation: 传统深度神经网络依赖黑盒函数拟合，缺乏可解释性。作者希望将分类问题重新表述为纤维束上的几何优化问题，通过微分几何结构提供清晰的几何可解释性，同时保持高效性。

Method: 1. 将类别作为基空间，小波变换特征作为纤维；2. 引入可学习黎曼度量识别重要频率特征分量；3. 通过能量函数最小化进行变分原型优化；4. 使用学习的黎曼度量下的Voronoi剖分进行分类，每个原型定义决策区域。

Result: 该工作展示了纤维束与机器学习结合能够同时提供可解释性和效率，这在传统深度学习中难以同时获得。分类通过最近原型分配实现，具有清晰的几何可解释性。

Conclusion: FiberNet框架成功地将微分几何与机器学习集成，为分类问题提供了可解释的几何优化方法，克服了传统深度学习在可解释性和效率之间的权衡问题。

Abstract: We propose Fiber Bundle Networks (FiberNet), a novel machine learning framework integrating differential geometry with machine learning. Unlike traditional deep neural networks relying on black-box function fitting, we reformulate classification as interpretable geometric optimization on fiber bundles, where categories form the base space and wavelet-transformed features lie in the fibers above each category. We introduce two innovations: (1) learnable Riemannian metrics identifying important frequency feature components, (2) variational prototype optimization through energy function minimization. Classification is performed via Voronoi tessellation under the learned Riemannian metric, where each prototype defines a decision region and test samples are assigned to the nearest prototype, providing clear geometric interpretability. This work demonstrates that the integration of fiber bundle with machine learning provides interpretability and efficiency, which are difficult to obtain simultaneously in conventional deep learning.

Abstract: As we deploy machine learning systems in the real world, a core challenge is to maintain a model that is performant even as the data shifts. Such shifts can take many forms: new classes may emerge that were absent during training, a problem known as open-set recognition, and the distribution of known categories may change. Guarantees on open-set recognition are mostly derived under the assumption that the distribution of known classes, which we call \emph{the background distribution}, is fixed. In this paper we develop \ours{}, a method that is guaranteed to solve open-set recognition even in the challenging case where the background distribution shifts. We prove that the method works under benign assumptions that the novel class is separable from the non-novel classes, and provide theoretical guarantees that it outperforms a representative baseline in a simplified overparameterized setting. We develop techniques to make \ours{} scalable and robust, and perform comprehensive empirical evaluations on image and text data. The results show that \ours{} significantly outperforms existing open-set recognition methods under background shift. Moreover, we provide new insights into how factors such as the size of the novel class influences performance, an aspect that has not been extensively explored in prior work.

*Ahmad Ali*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种将机器学习原子间势能（MLIPs）从传统的标量回归方法转变为多分类方法的框架，通过预测能量/力的分类分布来量化模型不确定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统MLIPs使用标量回归方法预测单个能量值和对应的力，虽然计算成本低但缺乏对模型不确定性的量化。作者希望开发一种能够提供更丰富监督信号并量化模型置信度的方法。

Method: 将能量/力预测问题重新表述为多分类问题：预测能量/力的直方图分布，将标量目标转换为直方图，使用交叉熵损失训练模型。

Result: 分类方法在绝对误差性能上与回归基线相当，同时能够通过预测分布的熵来量化认知不确定性，这是标量回归方法所不具备的。

Conclusion: 多分类方法为MLIPs提供了一种原则性的不确定性量化框架，在保持预测精度的同时增强了模型的可解释性和可靠性评估能力。

Abstract: Density Functional Theory (DFT) is a widely used computational method for estimating the energy and behavior of molecules. Machine Learning Interatomic Potentials (MLIPs) are models trained to approximate DFT-level energies and forces at dramatically lower computational cost. Many modern MLIPs rely on a scalar regression formulation; given information about a molecule, they predict a single energy value and corresponding forces while minimizing absolute error with DFT's calculations. In this work, we explore a multi-class classification formulation that predicts a categorical distribution over energy/force values, providing richer supervision through multiple targets. Most importantly, this approach offers a principled way to quantify model uncertainty.
  In particular, our method predicts a histogram of the energy/force distribution, converts scalar targets into histograms, and trains the model using cross-entropy loss. Our results demonstrate that this categorical formulation can achieve absolute error performance comparable to regression baselines. Furthermore, this representation enables the quantification of epistemic uncertainty through the entropy of the predicted distribution, offering a measure of model confidence absent in scalar regression approaches.

TL;DR: ThermAl是一个基于物理信息的生成式AI框架，用于从输入活动配置文件直接识别热源并估计全芯片瞬态和稳态热分布，比传统FEM工具快约200倍，精度达0.71°C RMSE。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代集成电路中非均匀功耗和高晶体管密度导致快速温度峰值和可靠性问题。传统FEM模拟精度高但计算成本大，不适合早期设计阶段，需要多次迭代设计周期来解决后期热故障。

Method: 提出ThermAl框架，采用增强位置编码和玻尔兹曼正则化的混合U-Net架构，保持物理保真度。模型在COMSOL生成的热耗散图数据集上训练，涵盖从简单逻辑门到复杂设计。

Result: ThermAl在大规模电路上提供精确温度映射，RMSE仅0.71°C，比传统FEM工具快约200倍。在25-95°C扩展数据集上交叉验证，保持高精度（<2.2%满量程RMSE）。

Conclusion: ThermAl为早期热点检测和热模式学习提供高效解决方案，适用于大规模EDA工作流程，在高温条件下仍保持良好泛化能力。

Abstract: Thermal analysis is increasingly critical in modern integrated circuits, where non-uniform power dissipation and high transistor densities can cause rapid temperature spikes and reliability concerns. Traditional methods, such as FEM-based simulations offer high accuracy but computationally prohibitive for early-stage design, often requiring multiple iterative redesign cycles to resolve late-stage thermal failures. To address these challenges, we propose 'ThermAl', a physics-informed generative AI framework which effectively identifies heat sources and estimates full-chip transient and steady-state thermal distributions directly from input activity profiles. ThermAl employs a hybrid U-Net architecture enhanced with positional encoding and a Boltzmann regularizer to maintain physical fidelity. Our model is trained on an extensive dataset of heat dissipation maps, ranging from simple logic gates (e.g., inverters, NAND, XOR) to complex designs, generated via COMSOL. Experimental results demonstrate that ThermAl delivers precise temperature mappings for large circuits, with a root mean squared error (RMSE) of only 0.71°C, and outperforms conventional FEM tools by running up to ~200 times faster. We analyze performance across diverse layouts and workloads, and discuss its applicability to large-scale EDA workflows. While thermal reliability assessments often extend beyond 85°C for post-layout signoff, our focus here is on early-stage hotspot detection and thermal pattern learning. To ensure generalization beyond the nominal operating range 25-55°C, we additionally performed cross-validation on an extended dataset spanning 25-95°C maintaining a high accuracy (<2.2% full-scale RMSE) even under elevated temperature conditions representative of peak power and stress scenarios.

Abstract: This study presents a reinforcement learning (RL)-based control strategy for adaptive lighting regulation in controlled environments using a low-power microcontroller. A model-free Q-learning algorithm was implemented to dynamically adjust the brightness of a Light-Emitting Diode (LED) based on real-time feedback from a light-dependent resistor (LDR) sensor. The system was trained to stabilize at 13 distinct light intensity levels (L1 to L13), with each target corresponding to a specific range within the 64-state space derived from LDR readings. A total of 130 trials were conducted, covering all target levels with 10 episodes each. Performance was evaluated in terms of convergence speed, steps taken, and time required to reach target states. Box plots and histograms were generated to analyze the distribution of training time and learning efficiency across targets. Experimental validation demonstrated that the agent could effectively learn to stabilize at varying light levels with minimal overshooting and smooth convergence, even in the presence of environmental perturbations. This work highlights the feasibility of lightweight, on-device RL for energy-efficient lighting control and sets the groundwork for multi-modal environmental control applications in resource-constrained agricultural systems.

TL;DR: DA-SHRED是一个机器学习框架，通过浅层循环解码器结合仿真模型和真实传感器数据进行数据同化，填补仿真与现实的差距，并恢复仿真模型中缺失的动力学。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代传感需求日益增长，需要数据效率、实时处理和在有限传感覆盖下的部署。仿真模型往往忽略小尺度或隐藏过程，对扰动敏感，或过度简化参数相关性，导致重建结果与传感器测量的现实存在差距，因此需要数据同化来整合观测数据与预测仿真模型。

Conclusion: 该框架通过结合仿真模型的潜在空间学习和真实传感器数据更新，有效解决了复杂物理系统中数据同化的挑战，为仿真到现实的转换提供了机器学习解决方案。

Abstract: The requirements of modern sensing are rapidly evolving, driven by increasing demands for data efficiency, real-time processing, and deployment under limited sensing coverage. Complex physical systems are often characterized through the integration of a limited number of point sensors in combination with scientific computations which approximate the dominant, full-state dynamics. Simulation models, however, inevitably neglect small-scale or hidden processes, are sensitive to perturbations, or oversimplify parameter correlations, leading to reconstructions that often diverge from the reality measured by sensors. This creates a critical need for data assimilation, the process of integrating observational data with predictive simulation models to produce coherent and accurate estimates of the full state of complex physical systems. We propose a machine learning framework for Data Assimilation with a SHallow REcurrent Decoder (DA-SHRED) which bridges the simulation-to-real (SIM2REAL) gap between computational modeling and experimental sensor data. For real-world physics systems modeling high-dimensional spatiotemporal fields, where the full state cannot be directly observed and must be inferred from sparse sensor measurements, we leverage the latent space learned from a reduced simulation model via SHRED, and update these latent variables using real sensor data to accurately reconstruct the full system state. Furthermore, our algorithm incorporates a sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics based regression model in the latent space to identify functionals corresponding to missing dynamics in the simulation model. We demonstrate that DA-SHRED successfully closes the SIM2REAL gap and additionally recovers missing dynamics in highly complex systems, demonstrating that the combination of efficient temporal encoding and physics-informed correction enables robust data assimilation.

Abstract: Geospatial foundation models (GeoFMs) promise broad generalisation capacity for Earth observation (EO) tasks, particularly under data-limited conditions. However, their large size poses a barrier to deployment on resource-constrained space hardware. To address this, we present compact variants of a Vision Transformer (ViT)-based GeoFM that preserve downstream task performance while enabling onboard execution. Evaluation across five downstream tasks and validation in two representative flight environments show that model compression and domain adaptation are critical to reducing size and resource demands while maintaining high performance under operational conditions. We further demonstrate reliable on-orbit inference with the IMAGIN-e payload aboard the International Space Station. These results establish a pathway from large GeoFMs to flight-ready, resource-efficient deployments, expanding the feasibility of onboard AI for EO missions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer模型在训练数据之外的长度和结构复杂性上表现脆弱，存在外推失败的问题。需要一种自动化方法来提升模型的鲁棒性，而不依赖人工设计的难度启发式。

Method: 提出Counter-Example-Driven Curricula (CEDC)框架：1) 使用当前模型生成多样化候选问题；2) 通过快速可执行的验证器识别错误预测（反例）；3) 在包含这些失败案例的数据集上微调模型。迭代执行此过程。

Result: 在整数加法、排序、Dyck-2语言识别和三个文本分类基准测试中，CEDC相比静态训练和标准课程学习方法：1) 长度外推能力提升高达30倍；2) 计算效率比均匀数据增强高3.75倍；3) 无需人工难度启发式。

Conclusion: 验证器引导的失败驱动学习是一个简单、强大且高效的范式，能够显著增强Transformer模型的泛化能力，通过自动聚焦于模型自身的失败来构建自适应课程。

Abstract: Transformer models often exhibit brittle extrapolation, failing on inputs that are longer or structurally more complex than those seen during training. We introduce Counter-Example-Driven Curricula (CEDC), an automated framework that improves model robustness by iteratively focusing on its own failures. At each step, CEDC uses the current model to generate a diverse set of candidate problems, employs a fast, executable verifier to identify incorrect predictions (counter-examples), and then fine-tunes the model on a dataset enriched with these discovered failures. We evaluate CEDC on a suite of algorithmic and natural language tasks, including integer addition, sorting, Dyck-2 language recognition, and three text classification benchmarks. Compared to static training and standard curriculum learning baselines, CEDC achieves up to 30x greater length extrapolation, is 3.75x more computationally efficient than uniform data augmentation, and requires no manual difficulty heuristics. We provide a detailed analysis of the counter-examples, showing how the curriculum naturally adapts to target progressively more complex error modes. Our findings establish verifier-guided, failure-driven learning as a simple, powerful, and efficient paradigm for enhancing the generalization capabilities of Transformer models.

TL;DR: LGDC提出了一种结合自回归和扩散模型优势的混合图生成框架，通过谱保持的粗化-细化双向映射，在潜在空间用扩散生成图，再恢复细节，同时捕捉局部和全局结构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图生成方法存在局限性：自回归模型擅长捕捉局部结构（如度分布、聚类特性），但难以建模全局模式（如谱分布）；而一次性生成模型（如扩散模型）则相反。需要一种能同时兼顾局部和全局特性的混合方法。

Method: LGDC采用谱保持的粗化-细化过程，将图双向映射到潜在空间。在潜在空间使用扩散模型高效生成潜在图，然后通过细化过程恢复细节。这种设计结合了两种范式的优势：扩散模型处理全局模式，自回归过程恢复局部结构。

Result: 实验表明，LGDC在局部结构化数据集（Tree）上达到自回归模型的性能，在全局结构化数据集（Planar, Community-20）上达到扩散模型的性能，验证了混合生成方法的优势。

Conclusion: LGDC成功结合了自回归和扩散模型的优势，通过谱保持的粗化-细化双向映射，在潜在空间进行扩散生成，实现了同时捕捉图局部和全局特性的高效生成框架。

Abstract: Graph generation is a critical task across scientific domains. Existing methods fall broadly into two categories: autoregressive models, which iteratively expand graphs, and one-shot models, such as diffusion, which generate the full graph at once. In this work, we provide an analysis of these two paradigms and reveal a key trade-off: autoregressive models stand out in capturing fine-grained local structures, such as degree and clustering properties, whereas one-shot models excel at modeling global patterns, such as spectral distributions. Building on this, we propose LGDC (latent graph diffusion via spectrum-preserving coarsening), a hybrid framework that combines strengths of both approaches. LGDC employs a spectrum-preserving coarsening-decoarsening to bidirectionally map between graphs and a latent space, where diffusion efficiently generates latent graphs before expansion restores detail. This design captures both local and global properties with improved efficiency. Empirically, LGDC matches autoregressive models on locally structured datasets (Tree) and diffusion models on globally structured ones (Planar, Community-20), validating the benefits of hybrid generation.

Conclusion: IPTR通过有效利用参考仿真数据作为物理先验，显著提升了热源系统温度场重建的准确性和泛化性能，为解决测量成本高和分布偏移问题提供了有效方案

Abstract: Accurate reconstruction of temperature field of heat-source systems (TFR-HSS) is crucial for thermal monitoring and reliability assessment in engineering applications such as electronic devices and aerospace structures. However, the high cost of measurement acquisition and the substantial distributional shifts in temperature field across varying conditions present significant challenges for developing reconstruction models with robust generalization capabilities. Existing DNNs-based methods typically formulate TFR-HSS as a one-to-one regression problem based solely on target sparse measurements, without effectively leveraging reference simulation data that implicitly encode thermal knowledge. To address this limitation, we propose IPTR, an implicit physics-guided temperature field reconstruction framework that introduces sparse monitoring-temperature field pair from reference simulations as priors to enrich physical understanding. To integrate both reference and target information, we design a dual physics embedding module consisting of two complementary branches: an implicit physics-guided branch employing cross-attention to distill latent physics from the reference data, and an auxiliary encoding branch based on Fourier layers to capture the spatial characteristics of the target observation. The fused representation is then decoded to reconstruct the full temperature field. Extensive experiments under single-condition, multi-condition, and few-shot settings demonstrate that IPTR consistently outperforms existing methods, achieving state-of-the-art reconstruction accuracy and strong generalization capability.

Abstract: Neurons process information in ways that depend on their cell type, connectivity, and the brain region in which they are embedded. However, inferring these factors from neural activity remains a significant challenge. To build general-purpose representations that allow for resolving information about a neuron's identity, we introduce NuCLR, a self-supervised framework that aims to learn representations of neural activity that allow for differentiating one neuron from the rest. NuCLR brings together views of the same neuron observed at different times and across different stimuli and uses a contrastive objective to pull these representations together. To capture population context without assuming any fixed neuron ordering, we build a spatiotemporal transformer that integrates activity in a permutation-equivariant manner. Across multiple electrophysiology and calcium imaging datasets, a linear decoding evaluation on top of NuCLR representations achieves a new state-of-the-art for both cell type and brain region decoding tasks, and demonstrates strong zero-shot generalization to unseen animals. We present the first systematic scaling analysis for neuron-level representation learning, showing that increasing the number of animals used during pretraining consistently improves downstream performance. The learned representations are also label-efficient, requiring only a small fraction of labeled samples to achieve competitive performance. These results highlight how large, diverse neural datasets enable models to recover information about neuron identity that generalize across animals.

Abstract: With the rapid advances in programmable materials, reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) have become a pivotal technology for future wireless communications. The simultaneous transmitting and reflecting reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (STAR-RIS) can both transmit and reflect signals, enabling comprehensive signal control and expanding application scenarios. This paper introduces an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) to further enhance system flexibility and proposes an optimization design for the spectrum efficiency of the STAR-RIS-UAV-assisted wireless communication system. We present a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm capable of iteratively optimizing beamforming, phase shifts, and UAV positioning to maximize the system's sum rate through continuous interactions with the environment. To improve exploration in deterministic policies, we introduce a stochastic perturbation factor, which enhances exploration capabilities. As exploration is strengthened, the algorithm's ability to accurately evaluate the state-action value function becomes critical. Thus, based on the deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) algorithm, we propose a convolution-augmented deep deterministic policy gradient (CA-DDPG) algorithm that balances exploration and evaluation to improve the system's sum rate. The simulation results demonstrate that the CA-DDPG algorithm effectively interacts with the environment, optimizing the beamforming matrix, phase shift matrix, and UAV location, thereby improving system capacity and achieving better performance than other algorithms.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统Transformer存在"语义对齐税"问题，需要高昂优化成本从混沌初始化组织成连贯几何映射。这种依赖扩散学习导致"灾难性刚性"，模型无法适应新概念而不破坏预训练推理能力。

Method: 提出ISMR诊断协议揭示对齐是几何障碍；引入PRISM模型，在复数域用谐振频率编码语义身份，用O(N log N)的门控谐波卷积替代二次自注意力。

Result: 在WMT14翻译任务上，标准Transformer在静态基准上略有优势(23.88 vs 21.40 BLEU)，但在可塑性-稳定性压力测试中完全失败，新概念注入导致灾难性遗忘(-10.55 BLEU)。PRISM展示无损可塑性，96%的5-shot获取，仅轻微退化(-0.84 BLEU)。

Conclusion: 谐波表示有效解耦记忆与推理，为实时知识适应的可塑性-稳定性困境提供结构解决方案，表明频率编码是比几何映射更基础的表示形式。

Abstract: Standard Transformers suffer from a "Semantic Alignment Tax", a prohibitive optimization cost required to organize a chaotic initialization into a coherent geometric map via local gradient diffusion. We hypothesize that this reliance on diffusive learning creates "Catastrophic Rigidity", rendering models unable to adapt to novel concepts without destroying their pre-trained reasoning capabilities. To isolate this phenomenon, we introduce Iterative Semantic Map Refinement (ISMR), a diagnostic protocol revealing that alignment is a fixed geometric barrier that scaling cannot solve; a 20-layer model overcomes this barrier no faster than a 1-layer model. We introduce the Phase-Resonant Intelligent Spectral Model (PRISM). PRISM encodes semantic identity as resonant frequencies in the complex domain (C^d) and replaces quadratic self-attention with linearithmic O(N log N) Gated Harmonic Convolutions. We validate PRISM on the WMT14 translation task. While the Standard Transformer maintains a slight edge in general competence on static benchmarks (23.88 vs 21.40 BLEU), it fails the "Plasticity-Stability" stress test completely. When injected with novel concepts, the Transformer suffers Catastrophic Forgetting, degrading by -10.55 BLEU points while achieving only 60% acquisition. In contrast, PRISM demonstrates Lossless Plasticity, achieving 96% 5-shot acquisition with negligible degradation (-0.84 BLEU). These results suggest that harmonic representations effectively decouple memory from reasoning, offering a structural solution to the plasticity-stability dilemma in real-time knowledge adaptation.

Abstract: With the rapid development of electricity markets, price volatility has significantly increased, making accurate forecasting crucial for power system operations and market decisions. Traditional linear models cannot capture the complex nonlinear characteristics of electricity pricing, necessitating advanced machine learning approaches. This study compares eight machine learning models using Spanish electricity market data, integrating consumption, generation, and meteorological variables. The models evaluated include linear regression, ridge regression, decision tree, KNN, random forest, gradient boosting, SVR, and XGBoost. Results show that KNN achieves the best performance with R^2 of 0.865, MAE of 3.556, and RMSE of 5.240. To enhance interpretability, LIME analysis reveals that meteorological factors and supply-demand indicators significantly influence price fluctuations through nonlinear relationships. This work demonstrates the effectiveness of machine learning models in electricity price forecasting while improving decision transparency through interpretability analysis.

Conclusion: 该方法为OPF问题提供了一种新颖的基于神经网络动力学和能量梯度流的求解框架，克服了传统方法和现有深度学习方法的局限性。

Abstract: Optimal Power Flow (OPF) is a core optimization problem in power system operation and planning, aiming to minimize generation costs while satisfying physical constraints such as power flow equations, generator limits, and voltage limits. Traditional OPF solving methods typically employ iterative optimization algorithms (such as interior point methods, sequential quadratic programming, etc.), with limitations including low computational efficiency, initial value sensitivity, and low batch computation efficiency. Most existing deep learning-based OPF methods rely on supervised learning, requiring pre-solving large numbers of cases, and have difficulty guaranteeing physical consistency. This paper proposes an Optimal Power Flow solving method based on neural network dynamics and energy gradient flow, transforming OPF problems into energy minimization problems. By constructing an energy function to measure the degree of deviation from the constraint manifold, and guiding networks to learn optimal solutions that simultaneously satisfy power flow constraints and minimize costs through gradient flow. Neural networks are trained unsupervised by directly minimizing physical residuals, requiring no labeled data, achieving true "end-to-end" physics-constrained learning.

Abstract: Answer verification methods are widely employed in language model training pipelines spanning data curation, evaluation, and reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR). While prior work focus on developing unified verifiers applicable across multiple reasoning scenarios, significant challenges remain in computation-oriented scientific domains, such as algebraic equivalence checking and physical constant substitution. In this paper, we introduce \model, a tool-augmented verifier that leverages external executors to perform precise computations and symbolic simplifications. \model enables robust verification that goes beyond simple semantic matching. We propose a novel two-stage pipeline, which begin with cold-start fine-tuning and followed by multi-turn reinforcement learning with tool integration. Extensive experiments conducted on STEM subjects, general QA, and long-form reasoning tasks demonstrates strong generalization of \model. The results shows that the \model achieves state-of-the-art performance on VerifyBench-Hard and SCI-Bench. And we also employ our \model in RLVR as a reward model, the results show that it consistently outperforms both rubric-based and model-based verifiers on AIME'24 and AIME'25, demonstrating strong potential to enhance reasoning capabilities of LLM.

TL;DR: BARPO：通过双层框架统一标准策略优化和对抗鲁棒策略优化，通过调节对抗强度来缓解鲁棒性与最优性之间的权衡，实现理论与实证性能的协调。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度强化学习中，最优性与对抗鲁棒性通常被视为冲突目标。虽然CAR理论表明两者可能一致，但实践中标准策略优化（SPO）和对抗鲁棒策略优化（ARPO）之间存在理论与实践的差距，需要在保持鲁棒性的同时实现最优性能。

Method: 提出BARPO（Bilevel Adversarially Robust Policy Optimization）双层框架，统一SPO和ARPO，通过调节对抗强度来平衡鲁棒性与最优性。该框架改善了全局优化景观的可导航性，同时保留全局最优解。

Result: 大量实证结果表明，BARPO在多个任务中一致优于原始ARPO方法，能够有效协调理论一致性与实证性能，在保持鲁棒性的同时获得更好的回报。

Conclusion: BARPO通过调节对抗强度的双层框架，成功缓解了强化学习中鲁棒性与最优性的实践权衡，为实现理论预测的鲁棒最优策略提供了实用方法。

Abstract: Achieving optimality and adversarial robustness in deep reinforcement learning has long been regarded as conflicting goals. Nonetheless, recent theoretical insights presented in CAR suggest a potential alignment, raising the important question of how to realize this in practice. This paper first identifies a key gap between theory and practice by comparing standard policy optimization (SPO) and adversarially robust policy optimization (ARPO). Although they share theoretical consistency, a fundamental tension between robustness and optimality arises in practical policy gradient methods. SPO tends toward convergence to vulnerable first-order stationary policies (FOSPs) with strong natural performance, whereas ARPO typically favors more robust FOSPs at the expense of reduced returns. Furthermore, we attribute this tradeoff to the reshaping effect of the strongest adversary in ARPO, which significantly complicates the global landscape by inducing deceptive sticky FOSPs. This improves robustness but makes navigation more challenging. To alleviate this, we develop the BARPO, a bilevel framework unifying SPO and ARPO by modulating adversary strength, thereby facilitating navigability while preserving global optima. Extensive empirical results demonstrate that BARPO consistently outperforms vanilla ARPO, providing a practical approach to reconcile theoretical and empirical performance.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前扩散专家混合模型研究主要集中在路由机制上，但架构配置空间未被充分探索。受大语言模型中专家混合设计范式启发，需要系统研究扩散专家混合模型的关键架构因素。

Method: 识别并系统研究扩散专家混合模型的关键架构因素：DeepSeek风格专家模块、替代中间宽度、不同专家数量、增强注意力位置编码。在潜在空间和像素空间扩散框架中进行广泛实验。

Result: 精心调整架构配置能充分释放扩散专家混合模型的潜力，其增益超过路由创新。提出的新架构在激活参数相等或更少的情况下超越强基线，提供了实用高效训练方案。

Conclusion: 扩散专家混合模型的架构配置与路由机制同等重要，系统研究揭示了关键设计因素，为构建更高效的扩散模型提供了新方向。

Abstract: Recent efforts on Diffusion Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models have primarily focused on developing more sophisticated routing mechanisms. However, we observe that the underlying architectural configuration space remains markedly under-explored. Inspired by the MoE design paradigms established in large language models (LLMs), we identify a set of crucial architectural factors for building effective Diffusion MoE models--including DeepSeek-style expert modules, alternative intermediate widths, varying expert counts, and enhanced attention positional encodings. Our systematic study reveals that carefully tuning these configurations is essential for unlocking the full potential of Diffusion MoE models, often yielding gains that exceed those achieved by routing innovations alone. Through extensive experiments, we present novel architectures that can be efficiently applied to both latent and pixel-space diffusion frameworks, which provide a practical and efficient training recipe that enables Diffusion MoE models to surpass strong baselines while using equal or fewer activated parameters.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在线学习系统（如推荐和广告）的超参数搜索成本极高，特别是在数据分布不断变化的环境中，需要更高效的优化方法

Method: 两阶段范式：第一阶段高效识别最有希望的配置（注重准确识别而非峰值性能），第二阶段只完整训练选中的候选；针对序列非平稳数据开发了新颖的数据缩减和预测策略

Result: 在Criteo 1TB数据集上减少超参数搜索总成本达10倍，在规模大两个数量级的工业广告系统中也实现了显著效率提升

Conclusion: 通过专注于准确识别而非峰值性能的两阶段方法，结合针对序列非平稳数据的专门策略，可以大幅降低在线学习系统的超参数搜索成本

Abstract: Online learning is the cornerstone of applications like recommendation and advertising systems, where models continuously adapt to shifting data distributions. Model training for such systems is remarkably expensive, a cost that multiplies during hyperparameter search. We introduce a two-stage paradigm to reduce this cost: (1) efficiently identifying the most promising configurations, and then (2) training only these selected candidates to their full potential. Our core insight is that focusing on accurate identification in the first stage, rather than achieving peak performance, allows for aggressive cost-saving measures. We develop novel data reduction and prediction strategies that specifically overcome the challenges of sequential, non-stationary data not addressed by conventional hyperparameter optimization. We validate our framework's effectiveness through a dual evaluation: first on the Criteo 1TB dataset, the largest suitable public benchmark, and second on an industrial advertising system operating at a scale two orders of magnitude larger. Our methods reduce the total hyperparameter search cost by up to 10$\times$ on the public benchmark and deliver significant, validated efficiency gains in the industrial setting.

TL;DR: SparseSpec是一个自推测解码框架，通过稀疏注意力机制和系统优化解决长文本生成中的内存瓶颈问题，实现高达2.13倍的吞吐量提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前语言模型在复杂推理任务中需要生成长链思维（CoT）解决方案，但长文本生成将推理瓶颈从计算密集型转变为内存密集型。每个token的生成都需要对之前所有token进行全注意力计算，导致KV-Cache内存访问需求随生成长度线性增长，给内存带宽带来巨大压力。

Method: 提出SparseSpec自推测解码框架，包含：1) PillarAttn稀疏注意力机制作为草稿模型，通过复用验证阶段信息准确选择关键token；2) 统一调度器批量处理token草拟和验证；3) 延迟验证实现CPU/GPU重叠；4) 动态KV-Cache管理最大化内存利用率。

Result: 在各种模型和数据集上，SparseSpec优于现有最优解决方案，实现了高达2.13倍的吞吐量加速。

Conclusion: SparseSpec通过创新的稀疏注意力机制和系统级协同设计，有效解决了长文本生成中的内存瓶颈问题，显著提升了推理效率，为大规模语言模型的高效部署提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Reasoning language models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities on challenging tasks by generating elaborate chain-of-thought (CoT) solutions. However, such lengthy generation shifts the inference bottleneck from compute-bound to memory-bound. To generate each token, the model applies full attention to all previously generated tokens, requiring memory access to an increasingly large KV-Cache. Consequently, longer generations demand more memory access for every step, leading to substantial pressure on memory bandwidth.
  To address this, we introduce SparseSpec, a speculative decoding framework that reuses the same model as the draft and target models (i.e., self-speculation). SparseSpec features a novel sparse attention mechanism, PillarAttn, as the draft model, which accurately selects critical tokens via elegantly reusing information from the verification stage. Furthermore, SparseSpec co-designs self-speculation with three system innovations: (1) a unified scheduler to batch token drafting and verification, (2) delayed verification for CPU/GPU overlap, and (3) dynamic KV-Cache management to maximize memory utilization. Across various models and datasets, SparseSpec outperforms state-of-the-art solutions, with an up to 2.13x throughput speedup.

Abstract: Flow matching has recently emerged as a promising alternative to diffusion-based generative models, offering faster sampling and simpler training by learning continuous flows governed by ordinary differential equations. Despite growing empirical success, the theoretical understanding of flow matching remains limited, particularly in terms of sample complexity results. In this work, we provide the first analysis of the sample complexity for flow-matching based generative models without assuming access to the empirical risk minimizer (ERM) of the loss function for estimating the velocity field. Under standard assumptions on the loss function for velocity field estimation and boundedness of the data distribution, we show that a sufficiently expressive neural network can learn a velocity field such that with $\mathcal{O}(ε^{-4})$ samples, such that the Wasserstein-2 distance between the learned and the true distribution is less than $\mathcal{O}(ε)$. The key technical idea is to decompose the velocity field estimation error into neural-network approximation error, statistical error due to the finite sample size, and optimization error due to the finite number of optimization steps for estimating the velocity field. Each of these terms are then handled via techniques that may be of independent interest.

<details>

Motivation: 现有量化方法（如AWQ、SpQR）需要校准数据，但在数据隐私重要或校准数据不可用时无法应用。需要开发无需数据的量化方法。

Method: 基于SVD的结构感知方法：通过奇异值分解识别主成分权重，保留前k个与主成分对齐的FP32权重，同时对剩余权重进行激进量化。

Result: 在GLUE基准测试（MRPC、RTE、QNLI）上，SVD方法在RTE任务上达到66.06%准确率，优于AWQ（65.34%）和SpQR（65.34%），证明结构重要性高度相关于功能重要性。

Conclusion: 内在矩阵结构可以作为权重重要性的鲁棒代理，无需前向传递或校准数据，为隐私敏感场景下的模型量化提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) continue to scale in parameter count, deploying them on commodity hardware has become increasingly challenging. Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) addresses this by reducing the precision of model weights, typically to 4-bit or lower. However, uniform quantization often leads to significant performance degradation due to the presence of ``outlier features'' -- weights that, while few in number, are critical for maintaining model accuracy. Current state-of-the-art methods such as AWQ (Activation-aware Weight Quantization) and SpQR (Sparse Quantization Representations) rely on calibration data to identify these salient weights via activation magnitudes or Hessian sensitivity. In scenarios where data privacy is paramount or calibration data is unavailable, these methods are inapplicable.
  In this work, we propose a data-free, structure-aware hypothesis: that the weights identified as Principal Components via Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) are intrinsically important to the model's downstream performance. We introduce a novel selection heuristic that preserves the top-$k$ weights aligned with the principal components in FP32, while aggressively quantizing the residual weights. We compare our method against activation-aware (AWQ) and second-order (SpQR) methods across GLUE benchmarks (MRPC, RTE, QNLI) using a DistilBERT backbone. Our experiments reveal that structural importance is highly correlated with functional importance. On the challenging RTE task, our SVD-based method achieves an accuracy of 66.06\%, outperforming both AWQ (65.34\%) and SpQR (65.34\%) at high protection budgets, validating that intrinsic matrix structure can serve as a robust proxy for weight saliency without the need for forward passes or calibration data.

Abstract: Neural prediction offers a promising approach to forecasting the individual variability of neurocognitive functions and disorders and providing prognostic indicators for personalized invention. However, it is challenging to translate neural predictive models into medical artificial intelligent applications due to the limitations of domain shift and label scarcity. Here, we propose the directed evolution model (DEM), a novel computational model that mimics the trial-and-error processes of biological directed evolution to approximate optimal solutions for predictive modeling tasks. We demonstrated that the directed evolution algorithm is an effective strategy for uncertainty exploration, enhancing generalization in reinforcement learning. Furthermore, by incorporating replay buffer and continual backpropagate methods into DEM, we provide evidence of achieving better trade-off between exploitation and exploration in continuous learning settings. We conducted experiments on four different datasets for children with cochlear implants whose spoken language developmental outcomes vary considerably on the individual-child level. Preoperative neural MRI data has shown to accurately predict the post-operative outcome of these children within but not across datasets. Our results show that DEM can efficiently improve the performance of cross-domain pre-implantation neural predictions while addressing the challenge of label scarcity in target domain.

Motivation: 传统MoCA评估使用"0/1"二分法评估立方体复制测试时，教育水平较低的老年人通常得0分，导致评估结果存在严重偏差。需要更精细的评估方法来准确评估视觉空间认知能力。

Method: 使用Cogni-CareV3.0软件收集立方体复制测试的动态笔迹数据，提取分段动态笔迹的空间和运动特征，对不等维特征矩阵进行归一化，最后采用结合注意力机制的双向LSTM网络模型进行分类。

Abstract: Background: Impairment of visual spatial cognitive function is the most common early clinical manifestation of Alzheimer's Disease (AD). When the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) uses the "0/1" binary method ("pass/fail") to evaluate the visual spatial cognitive ability represented by the Cube Copying Test(CCT), the elder with less formal education generally score 0 point, resulting in serious bias in the evaluation results. Therefore, this study proposes a fine evaluation method for CCT based on dynamic handwriting feature extraction of DH-SCSM-BLA. method : The Cogni-CareV3.0 software independently developed by our team was used to collect dynamic handwriting data of CCT. Then, the spatial and motion features of segmented dynamic handwriting were extracted, and feature matrix with unequal dimensions were normalized. Finally, a bidirectional long short-term memory network model combined with attention mechanism (BiLSTM-Attention) was adopted for classification. Result: The experimental results showed that: The proposed method has significant superiority compared to similar studies, with a classification accuracy of 86.69%. The distribution of cube drawing ability scores has significant regularity for three aspects such as MCI patients and healthy control group, age, and levels of education. It was also found that score for each cognitive task including cube drawing ability score is negatively correlated with age. Score for each cognitive task including cube drawing ability score, but positively correlated with levels of education significantly. Conclusion: This study provides a relatively objective and comprehensive evaluation method for early screening and personalized intervention of visual spatial cognitive impairment.

Conclusion: PRISMA通过将PDE残差作为架构特征而非外部优化目标，解决了传统扩散PDE求解器的瓶颈问题，实现了快速、鲁棒、准确且无需敏感超参数调优的PDE求解。

Abstract: Diffusion-based solvers for partial differential equations (PDEs) are often bottle-necked by slow gradient-based test-time optimization routines that use PDE residuals for loss guidance. They additionally suffer from optimization instabilities and are unable to dynamically adapt their inference scheme in the presence of noisy PDE residuals. To address these limitations, we introduce PRISMA (PDE Residual Informed Spectral Modulation with Attention), a conditional diffusion neural operator that embeds PDE residuals directly into the model's architecture via attention mechanisms in the spectral domain, enabling gradient-descent free inference. In contrast to previous methods that use PDE loss solely as external optimization targets, PRISMA integrates PDE residuals as integral architectural features, making it inherently fast, robust, accurate, and free from sensitive hyperparameter tuning. We show that PRISMA has competitive accuracy, at substantially lower inference costs, compared to previous methods across five benchmark PDEs, especially with noisy observations, while using 10x to 100x fewer denoising steps, leading to 15x to 250x faster inference.

Conclusion: 该研究为大规模语言模型强化学习训练提供了理论解释和实用方法，揭示了训练稳定性的关键条件，并开发了稳定RL训练的配方，有助于未来研究。

Abstract: This paper proposes a novel formulation for reinforcement learning (RL) with large language models, explaining why and under what conditions the true sequence-level reward can be optimized via a surrogate token-level objective in policy gradient methods such as REINFORCE. Specifically, through a first-order approximation, we show that this surrogate becomes increasingly valid only when both the training-inference discrepancy and policy staleness are minimized. This insight provides a principled explanation for the crucial role of several widely adopted techniques in stabilizing RL training, including importance sampling correction, clipping, and particularly Routing Replay for Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models. Through extensive experiments with a 30B MoE model totaling hundreds of thousands of GPU hours, we show that for on-policy training, the basic policy gradient algorithm with importance sampling correction achieves the highest training stability. When off-policy updates are introduced to accelerate convergence, combining clipping and Routing Replay becomes essential to mitigate the instability caused by policy staleness. Notably, once training is stabilized, prolonged optimization consistently yields comparable final performance regardless of cold-start initialization. We hope that the shared insights and the developed recipes for stable RL training will facilitate future research.

*Dongseok Kim,Hyoungsun Choi,Mohamed Jismy Aashik Rasool,Gisung Oh*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CLAPS是一种后验感知的共形回归方法，结合最后一层拉普拉斯近似和分割共形校准，通过高斯后验定义双侧后验CDF评分，在保持目标覆盖率的条件下获得更窄的预测区间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统共形回归方法通常只依赖点估计，未能充分利用预测分布的形状信息。在小到中型表格数据集上，数据稀缺且不确定性建模很重要，需要更高效的预测区间。

Method: CLAPS结合最后一层拉普拉斯近似（获得高斯后验）和分割共形校准，定义双侧后验CDF评分作为共形度量，使共形度量与完整预测形状对齐而非仅点估计。

Result: 在相同MLP骨干网络的多个基准测试中，CLAPS始终达到名义覆盖率，同时提高效率（更窄的预测区间）且开销最小，特别是在小到中型表格数据集上表现优异。

Conclusion: CLAPS提供了一种清晰实用的改进方案，优于基于残差的共形基线方法，通过轻量级诊断套件帮助理解预测区间缩小的原因，分离了偶然不确定性和认知不确定性。

Abstract: We present CLAPS, a posterior-aware conformal regression method that pairs a Last-Layer Laplace Approximation with split-conformal calibration. From the resulting Gaussian posterior, CLAPS defines a simple two-sided posterior CDF score that aligns the conformity metric with the full predictive shape, not just a point estimate. This alignment yields narrower prediction intervals at the same target coverage, especially on small to medium tabular datasets where data are scarce and uncertainty modeling matters. We also provide a lightweight diagnostic suite that separates aleatoric and epistemic components and visualizes posterior behavior, helping practitioners understand why intervals shrink when they do. Across multiple benchmarks using the same MLP backbone, CLAPS consistently attains nominal coverage with improved efficiency and minimal overhead, offering a clear, practical upgrade to residual-based conformal baselines.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ECCFM是一种用于纠错码神经解码器的架构无关训练框架，通过概率流ODE和微分时间正则化实现单步高保真解码，相比扩散模型获得30-100倍推理加速。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于扩散模型的神经解码器虽然性能优异，但迭代采样过程限制了其在低延迟场景下的实用性，需要开发既能保持高精度又能实现高效单步推理的解码方法。

Method: 将反向去噪过程建模为概率流常微分方程（PF-ODE），通过微分时间正则化强制平滑性，使模型能够学习将噪声信号沿解码轨迹直接映射到原始码字，实现单步推理。

Result: 在多个解码基准测试中，ECCFM获得了比自回归和基于扩散的基线更低的误码率（BER），在长码上表现尤为突出，同时推理速度比去噪扩散解码器快30-100倍。

Conclusion: ECCFM提供了一种高效的单步神经解码框架，在保持高解码精度的同时显著提升推理速度，为低延迟通信系统中的可靠解码提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Error Correction Codes (ECC) are fundamental to reliable digital communication, yet designing neural decoders that are both accurate and computationally efficient remains challenging. Recent denoising diffusion decoders with transformer backbones achieve state-of-the-art performance, but their iterative sampling limits practicality in low-latency settings. We introduce the Error Correction Consistency Flow Model (ECCFM), an architecture-agnostic training framework for high-fidelity one-step decoding. By casting the reverse denoising process as a Probability Flow Ordinary Differential Equation (PF-ODE) and enforcing smoothness through a differential time regularization, ECCFM learns to map noisy signals along the decoding trajectory directly to the original codeword in a single inference step. Across multiple decoding benchmarks, ECCFM attains lower bit-error rates (BER) than autoregressive and diffusion-based baselines, with notable improvements on longer codes, while delivering inference speeds up from 30x to 100x faster than denoising diffusion decoders.

TL;DR: 提出RE-LLM框架，将大语言模型集成到能源系统建模中，通过优化场景探索、机器学习代理模型和LLM自然语言生成，提升复杂能源模型结果的可解释性和决策支持能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 能源系统模型在多部门规划中应用广泛，但输出结果技术性强，难以被非专家利益相关者理解，限制了模型的实际影响力。随着能源转型复杂性增加（可再生能源比例上升、部门整合、深度不确定性），这一沟通障碍更加突出。

Method: 提出RE-LLM混合框架，包含三个核心要素：1) 基于优化的场景探索；2) 机器学习代理模型加速计算密集型模拟；3) LLM驱动的自然语言生成，将复杂结果转化为清晰、面向利益相关者的解释。

Result: 该框架不仅降低了计算负担，还增强了可解释性，能够实时推理权衡、敏感性和政策影响。框架可适应不同的优化平台和能源系统模型，具有广泛适用性。

Conclusion: RE-LLM通过融合速度、严谨性和可解释性，推进了以人为本的能源建模新范式，实现了对未来能源路径的交互式、多语言、可访问的参与，最终弥合了数据驱动分析与可持续转型可操作决策之间的差距。

Abstract: Energy system models are increasingly employed to guide long-term planning in multi-sectoral environments where decisions span electricity, heat, transport, land use, and industry. While these models provide rigorous quantitative insights, their outputs are often highly technical, making them difficult to interpret for non-expert stakeholders such as policymakers, planners, and the public. This communication gap limits the accessibility and practical impact of scenario-based modeling, particularly as energy transitions grow more complex with rising shares of renewables, sectoral integration, and deep uncertainties. To address this challenge, we propose the Renewable Energy Large Language Model (RE-LLM), a hybrid framework that integrates Large Language Models (LLMs) directly into the energy system modeling workflow. RE-LLM combines three core elements: (i) optimization-based scenario exploration, (ii) machine learning surrogates that accelerate computationally intensive simulations, and (iii) LLM-powered natural language generation that translates complex results into clear, stakeholder-oriented explanations. This integrated design not only reduces computational burden but also enhances inter-pretability, enabling real-time reasoning about trade-offs, sensitivities, and policy implications. The framework is adaptable across different optimization platforms and energy system models, ensuring broad applicability beyond the case study presented. By merging speed, rigor, and interpretability, RE-LLM advances a new paradigm of human-centric energy modeling. It enables interactive, multilingual, and accessible engagement with future energy pathways, ultimately bridging the final gap between data-driven analysis and actionable decision-making for sustainable transitions.

Motivation: 当前大多数深度学习降尺度模型都是针对特定区域开发的，它们在未见地理区域的泛化能力尚未得到充分探索，这限制了模型的实际应用价值。

Method: 使用全球框架，以ERA5再分析数据作为预测因子，IMERG降水估计（0.1°分辨率）作为目标。采用分层位置划分策略，将数据分配到全球15个不同区域，系统评估模型在不同地理区域的性能。

Abstract: Deep learning offers promising capabilities for the statistical downscaling of climate and weather forecasts, with generative approaches showing particular success in capturing fine-scale precipitation patterns. However, most existing models are region-specific, and their ability to generalize to unseen geographic areas remains largely unexplored. In this study, we evaluate the generalization performance of generative downscaling models across diverse regions. Using a global framework, we employ ERA5 reanalysis data as predictors and IMERG precipitation estimates at $0.1^\circ$ resolution as targets. A hierarchical location-based data split enables a systematic assessment of model performance across 15 regions around the world.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ComBo是一个基于探测的适配器，通过压缩多个基础模型的激活特征，使用轻量级transformer进行任务预测，无需数据集特定调优或反向传播，在多任务基准上表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 不同基础模型学习到不同的表征，但现有适应策略主要针对单个模型，无法充分利用多个模型的互补优势。现有探测方法在大规模特征集上扩展性差，且依赖数据集特定的超参数调优。

Method: ComBo压缩一个或多个基础模型各层的激活特征为紧凑的token级表示，使用轻量级transformer进行任务特定预测。引入机制评估每个基础模型的任务相关性，支持选择性适应。

Result: 在VTAB-1k基准的19个任务上，ComBo优于先前探测方法，匹配或超越更昂贵的替代方案（如基于蒸馏的模型融合），并能高效探测已调优模型。

Conclusion: ComBo提供了一个实用且通用的框架，能够有效整合多个基础模型的多样化表征，实现高效的多模型特征融合。

Abstract: Foundation models (FMs) trained with different objectives and data learn diverse representations, making some more effective than others for specific downstream tasks. Existing adaptation strategies, such as parameter-efficient fine-tuning, focus on individual models and do not exploit the complementary strengths across models. Probing methods offer a promising alternative by extracting information from frozen models, but current techniques do not scale well with large feature sets and often rely on dataset-specific hyperparameter tuning. We propose Combined backBones (ComBo), a simple and scalable probing-based adapter that effectively integrates features from multiple models and layers. ComBo compresses activations from layers of one or more FMs into compact token-wise representations and processes them with a lightweight transformer for task-specific prediction. Crucially, ComBo does not require dataset-specific tuning or backpropagation through the backbone models. However, not all models are equally relevant for all tasks. To address this, we introduce a mechanism that leverages ComBo's joint multi-backbone probing to efficiently evaluate each backbone's task-relevance, enabling both practical model comparison and improved performance through selective adaptation. On the 19 tasks of the VTAB-1k benchmark, ComBo outperforms previous probing methods, matches or surpasses more expensive alternatives, such as distillation-based model merging, and enables efficient probing of tuned models. Our results demonstrate that ComBo offers a practical and general-purpose framework for combining diverse representations from multiple FMs.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: EXCAP是一个可解释的长时序建模框架，通过注意力分段、因果解耦和潜在聚合机制，生成连贯、因果可解释的时间模式解释，满足时序连续性、模式中心、因果解耦和模型忠实性四大要求。

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有可解释AI方法仅生成点状重要性分数，无法捕捉趋势、周期和制度变化等时间结构，这削弱了人类对长时序模型的可解释性和信任度。

Method: 提出EXCAP统一框架：1）基于注意力的分段器提取连贯时间模式；2）由预训练因果图指导的因果结构化解码器；3）强制表示稳定性的潜在聚合机制。

Result: 在分类和预测基准测试中，EXCAP在保持强预测准确性的同时，生成连贯且因果可解释的解释。理论分析表明其提供平滑稳定的时间解释，对因果掩码扰动具有鲁棒性。

Conclusion: EXCAP为长时序可解释建模提供了原则性和可扩展的方法，对医疗和金融等高风险领域具有重要应用价值，满足所有四个可解释性要求。

Abstract: Explainability is essential for neural networks that model long time series, yet most existing explainable AI methods only produce point-wise importance scores and fail to capture temporal structures such as trends, cycles, and regime changes. This limitation weakens human interpretability and trust in long-horizon models. To address these issues, we identify four key requirements for interpretable time-series modeling: temporal continuity, pattern-centric explanation, causal disentanglement, and faithfulness to the model's inference process. We propose EXCAP, a unified framework that satisfies all four requirements. EXCAP combines an attention-based segmenter that extracts coherent temporal patterns, a causally structured decoder guided by a pre-trained causal graph, and a latent aggregation mechanism that enforces representation stability. Our theoretical analysis shows that EXCAP provides smooth and stable explanations over time and is robust to perturbations in causal masks. Extensive experiments on classification and forecasting benchmarks demonstrate that EXCAP achieves strong predictive accuracy while generating coherent and causally grounded explanations. These results show that EXCAP offers a principled and scalable approach to interpretable modeling of long time series with relevance to high-stakes domains such as healthcare and finance.

Conclusion: 该工作通过统一数学原理与实现策略，为傅里叶神经算子提供了全面的实践指南，旨在促进这一重要PDE求解框架的正确理解和可靠应用。

Abstract: Partial differential equations (PDEs) govern a wide variety of dynamical processes in science and engineering, yet obtaining their numerical solutions often requires high-resolution discretizations and repeated evaluations of complex operators, leading to substantial computational costs. Neural operators have recently emerged as a powerful framework for learning mappings between function spaces directly from data, enabling efficient surrogate models for PDE systems. Among these architectures, the Fourier Neural Operator (FNO) has become the most influential and widely adopted due to its elegant spectral formulation, which captures global correlations through learnable transformations in Fourier space while remaining invariant to discretization and resolution. Despite their success, the practical use of FNOs is often hindered by an incomplete understanding among practitioners of their theoretical foundations, practical constraints, and implementation details, which can lead to their incorrect or unreliable application. This work presents a comprehensive and practice-oriented guide to FNOs, unifying their mathematical principles with implementation strategies. We provide an intuitive exposition to the concepts of operator theory and signal-processing that underlie the FNO, detail its spectral parameterization and the computational design of all its components, and address common misunderstandings encountered in the literature. The exposition is closely integrated with the NeuralOperator 2.0.0 library, offering modular state-of-the-art implementations that faithfully reflect the theory. By connecting rigorous foundations with practical insight, this guide aims to establish a clear and reliable framework for applying FNOs effectively across diverse scientific and engineering fields.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ZIP-RC：一种零开销自适应推理方法，通过重用LLM前向传播中的保留logits来预测最终奖励和剩余长度，实现实时奖励-成本内省，从而优化推理效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM缺乏内省能力，无法预测自身成功概率和所需计算量。现有方法如Best-of-N使用固定样本预算导致成本高、延迟大，而学习验证器或奖励模型虽能提供置信度估计但增加额外开销。需要一种零开销的自适应推理方法来优化质量、计算和延迟之间的权衡。

Method: ZIP-RC在每次token预测时重用前向传播中保留或未使用的logits，输出最终奖励和剩余长度的联合分布。基于此联合分布计算采样效用函数（预期最大奖励、总计算量和延迟的线性组合），通过元动作决定继续生成哪些token前缀或启动新采样。

Result: 在混合难度数学基准测试中，ZIP-RC在相同或更低平均成本下比多数投票准确率提升高达12%，并在质量、计算和延迟之间形成平滑的帕累托前沿。

Conclusion: ZIP-RC通过提供实时奖励-成本内省，实现了自适应、高效的推理，解决了LLM缺乏内省能力的问题，在保持零推理开销的同时显著提升性能。

Abstract: Large language models excel at reasoning but lack key aspects of introspection, including anticipating their own success and the computation required to achieve it. Humans use real-time introspection to decide how much effort to invest, when to make multiple attempts, when to stop, and when to signal success or failure. Without this, LLMs struggle to make intelligent meta-cognition decisions. Test-time scaling methods like Best-of-N drive up cost and latency by using a fixed budget of samples regardless of the marginal benefit of each one at any point in generation, and the absence of confidence signals can mislead people, prevent appropriate escalation to better tools, and undermine trustworthiness. Learned verifiers or reward models can provide confidence estimates, but do not enable adaptive inference and add substantial cost by requiring extra models or forward passes. We present ZIP-RC, an adaptive inference method that equips models with zero-overhead inference-time predictions of reward and cost. At every token, ZIP-RC reuses reserved or unused logits in the same forward pass as next-token prediction to output a joint distribution over final reward and remaining length -- no extra models, architecture change, or inference overhead. This full joint distribution is used to compute a sampling utility which is the linear combination of the expected maximum reward, total compute, and latency of set of samples if generated to completion. During inference, we maximize this utility with meta-actions that determine which prefix of tokens to continue or initiate sampling from. On mixed-difficulty mathematical benchmarks, ZIP-RC improves accuracy by up to 12% over majority voting at equal or lower average cost, and traces smooth Pareto frontiers between quality, compute, and latency. By providing real-time reward-cost introspection, ZIP-RC enables adaptive, efficient reasoning.

Motivation: 现有模型合并方法相比单独微调的模型存在显著性能下降，即使是在相似任务上，这凸显了保留任务特定信息的必要性。

Method: DTS框架包含三个步骤：1）对任务特定信息进行奇异值分解，仅保留少量奇异值和向量；2）提出新的阈值化策略，将奇异向量元素分组并为每组分配缩放因子；3）扩展变体基于任务特征的语义相似性，以数据无关方式融合任务特定信息以实现泛化。

Result: DTS在广泛实验中始终优于最先进的基线方法，每个任务仅需1%的额外存储开销。在未见任务上的实验显示，DTS变体实现了显著更好的泛化性能。

Conclusion: DTS是一种有效的个性化模型合并框架，能够以最小存储开销保留任务特定信息，并在未见任务上实现良好泛化，为多任务能力提供了有前景的解决方案。

Abstract: Model merging has emerged as a promising paradigm for enabling multi-task capabilities without additional training. However, existing methods often experience substantial performance degradation compared with individually fine-tuned models, even on similar tasks, underscoring the need to preserve task-specific information. This paper proposes Decomposition, Thresholding, and Scaling (DTS), an approximation-based personalized merging framework that preserves task-specific information with minimal storage overhead. DTS first applies singular value decomposition to the task-specific information and retains only a small subset of singular values and vectors. It then introduces a novel thresholding strategy that partitions singular vector elements into groups and assigns a scaling factor to each group. To enable generalization to unseen tasks, we further extend DTS with a variant that fuses task-specific information in a data-free manner based on the semantic similarity of task characteristics. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DTS consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines while requiring only 1\% additional storage per task. Furthermore, experiments on unseen tasks show that the DTS variant achieves significantly better generalization performance. Our code is available at https://github.com/krumpguo/DTS.

Abstract: Water quality monitoring is a core component of ecological environmental protection. However, due to sensor failure or other inevitable factors, data missing often exists in long-term monitoring, posing great challenges in water quality analysis. This paper proposes a Neural Tucker Convolutional Network (NTCN) model for water quality data imputation, which features the following key components: a) Encode different mode entities into respective embedding vectors, and construct a Tucker interaction tensor by outer product operations to capture the complex mode-wise feature interactions; b) Use 3D convolution to extract fine-grained spatiotemporal features from the interaction tensor. Experiments on three real-world water quality datasets show that the proposed NTCN model outperforms several state-of-the-art imputation models in terms of accuracy.

### [179] [Does Flatness imply Generalization for Logistic Loss in Univariate Two-Layer ReLU Network?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01473)
*Dan Qiao,Yu-Xiang Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 研究证明，对于logistic损失，平坦解（flat solutions）的泛化能力比平方损失更微妙：平坦解在不确定区域内具有近最优泛化界，但存在处处确定却过拟合的平坦解，表明平坦性本身不足以保证泛化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索在logistic损失下，平坦解（受平坦/稳定最小值和Edge of Stability现象启发）是否像平方损失一样能够保证泛化。现有研究表明梯度下降在增大步长时会收敛到插值解（在无穷远处，对于可分情况），但平坦性是否足以保证泛化仍不清楚。

Method: 理论分析证明平坦解在logistic损失下的泛化特性：正面证明平坦解在由候选解确定的最左和最右不确定集之间的区域内具有近最优泛化界；负面证明存在任意平坦但处处确定且过拟合的解（在无穷远处）。通过控制良好的模拟研究验证理论预测。

Result: 平坦解在logistic损失下的泛化能力是微妙的：一方面，平坦解在不确定区域内具有近最优泛化界；另一方面，存在任意平坦但处处确定且过拟合的解，表明平坦性本身不足以保证泛化。

Conclusion: 对于logistic损失，平坦性隐含的泛化能力比平方损失更复杂。平坦解在不确定区域内具有良好的泛化性能，但存在处处确定的平坦过拟合解，因此平坦性本身不能作为泛化的充分条件。

Abstract: We consider the problem of generalization of arbitrarily overparameterized two-layer ReLU Neural Networks with univariate input. Recent work showed that under square loss, flat solutions (motivated by flat / stable minima and Edge of Stability phenomenon) provably cannot overfit, but it remains unclear whether the same phenomenon holds for logistic loss. This is a puzzling open problem because existing work on logistic loss shows that gradient descent with increasing step size converges to interpolating solutions (at infinity, for the margin-separable cases). In this paper, we prove that the \emph{flatness implied generalization} is more delicate under logistic loss. On the positive side, we show that flat solutions enjoy near-optimal generalization bounds within a region between the left-most and right-most \emph{uncertain} sets determined by each candidate solution. On the negative side, we show that there exist arbitrarily flat yet overfitting solutions at infinity that are (falsely) certain everywhere, thus certifying that flatness alone is insufficient for generalization in general. We demonstrate the effects predicted by our theory in a well-controlled simulation study.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多视图扩散模型缺乏统一的框架，无法灵活捕捉不同数据视图之间的相互作用和融合。需要一种能够统一现有方法并提供新自由度的理论框架来建模多视图数据的扩散几何。

Method: 提出多视图扩散轨迹（MDTs）框架，通过迭代组合多个视图的随机游走算子构建非齐次扩散过程。每个MDT定义轨迹依赖的扩散算子，具有清晰的概率和几何解释。建立了理论性质，推导了基于MDT的扩散距离和嵌入，并提出了在算子空间中学习MDT算子的策略。

Result: MDTs框架统一了现有多视图扩散模型，提供了视图交互和融合的新自由度。理论分析证明了点态算子和过程本身的遍历性。实验表明MDT算子在流形学习和数据聚类中具有实际影响，并可作为评估扩散方法的基准。

Conclusion: MDTs提供了一个灵活的多视图扩散几何构建框架，统一了现有方法，提供了理论保证，并在实际应用中展示了有效性。该框架不仅支持灵活的模型设计，还为评估扩散方法提供了中性基准。

Abstract: This paper introduces a comprehensive unified framework for constructing multi-view diffusion geometries through intertwined multi-view diffusion trajectories (MDTs), a class of inhomogeneous diffusion processes that iteratively combine the random walk operators of multiple data views. Each MDT defines a trajectory-dependent diffusion operator with a clear probabilistic and geometric interpretation, capturing over time the interplay between data views. Our formulation encompasses existing multi-view diffusion models, while providing new degrees of freedom for view interaction and fusion. We establish theoretical properties under mild assumptions, including ergodicity of both the point-wise operator and the process in itself. We also derive MDT-based diffusion distances, and associated embeddings via singular value decompositions. Finally, we propose various strategies for learning MDT operators within the defined operator space, guided by internal quality measures. Beyond enabling flexible model design, MDTs also offer a neutral baseline for evaluating diffusion-based approaches through comparison with randomly selected MDTs. Experiments show the practical impact of the MDT operators in a manifold learning and data clustering context.

Abstract: This report presents solutions to three machine learning challenges: compositional image retrieval, zero-shot anomaly detection, and backdoored model detection. In compositional image retrieval, we developed a system that processes visual and textual inputs to retrieve relevant images, achieving 95.38\% accuracy and ranking first with a clear margin over the second team. For zero-shot anomaly detection, we designed a model that identifies and localizes anomalies in images without prior exposure to abnormal examples, securing 1st place with 73.14\% accuracy. In the backdoored model detection task, we proposed a method to detect hidden backdoor triggers in neural networks, reaching an accuracy of 78\%, which placed our approach in second place. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods in addressing key challenges related to retrieval, anomaly detection, and model security, with implications for real-world applications in industries such as healthcare, manufacturing, and cybersecurity. Code for all solutions is available online.

Abstract: Bayesian Neural Networks provide a principled framework for uncertainty quantification by modeling the posterior distribution of network parameters. However, exact posterior inference is computationally intractable, and widely used approximations like the Laplace method struggle with scalability and posterior accuracy in modern deep networks. In this work, we revisit sampling techniques for posterior exploration, proposing a simple variation tailored to efficiently sample from the posterior in over-parameterized networks by leveraging the low-dimensional structure of loss minima. Building on this, we introduce a model that learns a deformation of the parameter space, enabling rapid posterior sampling without requiring iterative methods. Empirical results demonstrate that our approach achieves competitive posterior approximations with improved scalability compared to recent refinement techniques. These contributions provide a practical alternative for Bayesian inference in deep learning.

TL;DR: 提出Label Forensics框架，通过黑盒方式重构未文档化分类器中标签的语义含义，使用句子嵌入分布表示标签概念，实现92.24%的平均标签一致性。

Motivation: 当前许多文本分类器在网络上流通时缺乏内部语义文档，甚至故意隐藏。这些不透明的黑盒分类器可能在未受监管的网络环境中运行或被用于未知目的，引发了合理的取证和审计担忧。需要一种方法来推断未文档化黑盒分类器中每个标签编码的语义概念。

Abstract: The widespread adoption of natural language processing techniques has led to an unprecedented growth of text classifiers across the modern web. Yet many of these models circulate with their internal semantics undocumented or even intentionally withheld. Such opaque classifiers, which may expose only hard-label outputs, can operate in unregulated web environments or be repurposed for unknown intents, raising legitimate forensic and auditing concerns. In this paper, we position ourselves as investigators and work to infer the semantic concept each label encodes in an undocumented black-box classifier.
  Specifically, we introduce label forensics, a black-box framework that reconstructs a label's semantic meaning. Concretely, we represent a label by a sentence embedding distribution from which any sample reliably reflects the concept the classifier has implicitly learned for that label. We believe this distribution should maintain two key properties: precise, with samples consistently classified into the target label, and general, covering the label's broad semantic space. To realize this, we design a semantic neighborhood sampler and an iterative optimization procedure to select representative seed sentences that jointly maximize label consistency and distributional coverage. The final output, an optimized seed sentence set combined with the sampler, constitutes the empirical distribution representing the label's semantics. Experiments on multiple black-box classifiers achieve an average label consistency of around 92.24 percent, demonstrating that the embedding regions accurately capture each classifier's label semantics. We further validate our framework on an undocumented HuggingFace classifier, enabling fine-grained label interpretation and supporting responsible AI auditing.

Abstract: In this work, we consider learning-based applications in routing to solve a Vehicle Routing variant characterized by stochasticity and multiple objectives. Such problems are representative of practical settings where decision-makers have to deal with uncertainty in the operational environment as well as multiple conflicting objectives due to different stakeholders. We specifically consider travel time uncertainty. We also consider two objectives, total travel time and route makespan, that jointly target operational efficiency and labor regulations on shift length, although different objectives could be incorporated. Learning-based methods offer earnest computational advantages as they can repeatedly solve problems with limited interference from the decision-maker. We specifically focus on end-to-end deep learning models that leverage the attention mechanism and multiple solution trajectories. These models have seen several successful applications in routing problems. However, since travel times are not a direct input to these models due to the large dimensions of the travel time matrix, accounting for uncertainty is a challenge, especially in the presence of multiple objectives. In turn, we propose a model that simultaneously addresses stochasticity and multi-objectivity and provide a refined training mechanism for this model through scenario clustering to reduce training time. Our results show that our model is capable of constructing a Pareto Front of good quality within acceptable run times compared to three baselines.

Abstract: Change-point detection (CPD) in high-dimensional, large-volume time series is challenging for statistical consistency, scalability, and interpretability. We introduce TimePred, a self-supervised framework that reduces multivariate CPD to univariate mean-shift detection by predicting each sample's normalized time index. This enables efficient offline CPD using existing algorithms and supports the integration of XAI attribution methods for feature-level explanations. Our experiments show competitive CPD performance while reducing computational cost by up to two orders of magnitude. In an industrial manufacturing case study, we demonstrate improved detection accuracy and illustrate the practical value of interpretable change-point insights.

TL;DR: LLMs表现出强烈的亲利他主义隐性偏见，行为上比随机更利他，但隐性偏见不预测行为，且模型系统性高估自身利他行为，存在"美德信号差距"。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究大型语言模型是否表现出利他主义倾向，以及其隐性关联和自我报告是否能预测实际的利他行为，借鉴人类社会心理学方法评估LLM的利他特性。

Method: 使用多方法框架测试24个前沿LLM：1) 隐性关联测试测量隐性利他偏见；2) 强制二元选择任务测量行为利他主义；3) 自我评估量表测量显性利他信念。

Result: 所有模型都表现出强烈的亲利他隐性偏见；模型行为比随机更利他但差异大；隐性关联不预测行为；模型系统性高估自身利他行为（报告77.5% vs 实际65.6%），75%模型存在"美德信号差距"。

Conclusion: 建议将校准差距（自我报告与行为值之间的差异）作为标准化对齐指标，只有12.5%的模型实现了高亲社会行为和准确自我认知的理想组合。

Abstract: We investigate whether Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit altruistic tendencies, and critically, whether their implicit associations and self-reports predict actual altruistic behavior. Using a multi-method approach inspired by human social psychology, we tested 24 frontier LLMs across three paradigms: (1) an Implicit Association Test (IAT) measuring implicit altruism bias, (2) a forced binary choice task measuring behavioral altruism, and (3) a self-assessment scale measuring explicit altruism beliefs. Our key findings are: (1) All models show strong implicit pro-altruism bias (mean IAT = 0.87, p < .0001), confirming models "know" altruism is good. (2) Models behave more altruistically than chance (65.6% vs. 50%, p < .0001), but with substantial variation (48-85%). (3) Implicit associations do not predict behavior (r = .22, p = .29). (4) Most critically, models systematically overestimate their own altruism, claiming 77.5% altruism while acting at 65.6% (p < .0001, Cohen's d = 1.08). This "virtue signaling gap" affects 75% of models tested. Based on these findings, we recommend the Calibration Gap (the discrepancy between self-reported and behavioral values) as a standardized alignment metric. Well-calibrated models are more predictable and behaviorally consistent; only 12.5% of models achieve the ideal combination of high prosocial behavior and accurate self-knowledge.

Conclusion: Cas-Sensing通过分层重建框架有效解决了从稀疏测量中重建全场的问题，在科学和工程应用中具有实际部署潜力。

Abstract: Reconstructing full fields from extremely sparse and random measurements is a longstanding ill-posed inverse problem. A powerful framework for addressing such challenges is hierarchical probabilistic modeling, where uncertainty is represented by intermediate variables and resolved through marginalization during inference. Inspired by this principle, we propose Cascaded Sensing (Cas-Sensing), a hierarchical reconstruction framework that integrates an autoencoder-diffusion cascade. First, a neural operator-based functional autoencoder reconstructs the dominant structures of the original field - including large-scale components and geometric boundaries - from arbitrary sparse inputs, serving as an intermediate variable. Then, a conditional diffusion model, trained with a mask-cascade strategy, generates fine-scale details conditioned on these large-scale structures. To further enhance fidelity, measurement consistency is enforced via the manifold constrained gradient based on Bayesian posterior sampling during the generation process. This cascaded pipeline substantially alleviates ill-posedness, delivering accurate and robust reconstructions. Experiments on both simulation and real-world datasets demonstrate that Cas-Sensing generalizes well across varying sensor configurations and geometric boundaries, making it a promising tool for practical deployment in scientific and engineering applications.

Abstract: Recent studies suggest that the representations learned by large language models (LLMs) are partially aligned to those of the human brain. However, whether and why this alignment score arises from a similar sequence of computations remains elusive. In this study, we explore this question by examining temporally-resolved brain signals of participants listening to 10 hours of an audiobook. We study these neural dynamics jointly with a benchmark encompassing 22 LLMs varying in size and architecture type. Our analyses confirm that LLMs and the brain generate representations in a similar order: specifically, activations in the initial layers of LLMs tend to best align with early brain responses, while the deeper layers of LLMs tend to best align with later brain responses. This brain-LLM alignment is consistent across transformers and recurrent architectures. However, its emergence depends on both model size and context length. Overall, this study sheds light on the sequential nature of computations and the factors underlying the partial convergence between biological and artificial neural networks.

Abstract: Digital Twins (DTs) are increasingly used as autonomous decision-makers in complex socio-technical systems. Their mathematically optimal decisions often diverge from human expectations, exposing a persistent gap between algorithmic and bounded human rationality. This work addresses this gap by proposing a framework that operationalizes fairness as a learnable objective within optimization-based Digital Twins. We introduce a preference-driven learning pipeline that infers latent fairness objectives directly from human pairwise preferences over feasible decisions. A novel Siamese neural network is developed to generate convex quadratic cost functions conditioned on contextual information. The resulting surrogate objectives align optimization outcomes with human-perceived fairness while maintaining computational efficiency. The approach is demonstrated on a COVID-19 hospital resource allocation scenario. This study provides an actionable path toward embedding human-centered fairness in the design of autonomous decision-making systems.

Motivation: 法律AI系统需要可验证的保证，确保生成的文本忠实反映源文档。现有基于语义相似度的幻觉检测方法容忍实体替换，这在法律场景中可能导致严重后果（如混淆当事人、日期或法律条款）。

Method: 提出HalluGraph框架，通过从上下文、查询和响应中提取知识图，进行图结构对齐来量化幻觉。框架包含两个可解释指标：实体接地（EG）衡量响应中的实体是否出现在源文档中，关系保持（RP）验证断言的关系是否得到上下文支持。

Conclusion: HalluGraph为高风险法律应用提供了所需的透明度和可追溯性，能够从生成的断言追溯到源段落，建立完整的审计追踪。

Abstract: Legal AI systems powered by retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) face a critical accountability challenge: when an AI assistant cites case law, statutes, or contractual clauses, practitioners need verifiable guarantees that generated text faithfully represents source documents. Existing hallucination detectors rely on semantic similarity metrics that tolerate entity substitutions, a dangerous failure mode when confusing parties, dates, or legal provisions can have material consequences. We introduce HalluGraph, a graph-theoretic framework that quantifies hallucinations through structural alignment between knowledge graphs extracted from context, query, and response. Our approach produces bounded, interpretable metrics decomposed into \textit{Entity Grounding} (EG), measuring whether entities in the response appear in source documents, and \textit{Relation Preservation} (RP), verifying that asserted relationships are supported by context. On structured control documents, HalluGraph achieves near-perfect discrimination ($>$400 words, $>$20 entities), HalluGraph achieves $AUC = 0.979$, while maintaining robust performance ($AUC \approx 0.89$) on challenging generative legal task, consistently outperforming semantic similarity baselines. The framework provides the transparency and traceability required for high-stakes legal applications, enabling full audit trails from generated assertions back to source passages.

Abstract: Anomaly detection (AD) is a fundamental task of critical importance across numerous domains. Current systems increasingly operate in rapidly evolving environments that generate diverse yet interconnected data modalities -- such as time series, system logs, and tabular records -- as exemplified by modern IT systems. Effective AD methods in such environments must therefore possess two critical capabilities: (1) the ability to handle heterogeneous data formats within a unified framework, allowing the model to process and detect multiple modalities in a consistent manner during anomalous events; (2) a strong generalization ability to quickly adapt to new scenarios without extensive retraining. However, most existing methods fall short of these requirements, as they typically focus on single modalities and lack the flexibility to generalize across domains. To address this gap, we introduce a novel paradigm: In-Context Anomaly Detection (ICAD), where anomalies are defined by their dissimilarity to a relevant reference set of normal samples. Under this paradigm, we propose ICAD-LLM, a unified AD framework leveraging Large Language Models' in-context learning abilities to process heterogeneous data within a single model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ICAD-LLM achieves competitive performance with task-specific AD methods and exhibits strong generalization to previously unseen tasks, which substantially reduces deployment costs and enables rapid adaptation to new environments. To the best of our knowledge, ICAD-LLM is the first model capable of handling anomaly detection tasks across diverse domains and modalities.

Abstract: Accurate maps of atrial electrical activation are essential for personalised treatment of arrhythmias, yet biophysically detailed simulations remain computationally intensive for real-time clinical use or population-scale analyses. Here we introduce a geometry-independent operator-learning framework that predicts local activation time (LAT) fields across diverse left atrial anatomies with near-instantaneous inference. We generated a dataset of 308,700 simulations using a GPU-accelerated electrophysiology solver, systematically varying multiple pacing sites and physiologically varied conduction properties across 147 patient-specific geometries derived from two independent clinical cohorts. All anatomical and functional data are expressed in a Universal Atrium Coordinate system, providing a consistent representation that decouples electrophysiological patterns from mesh topology. Within this coordinate space, we designed a neural operator with a vision-transformer backbone to learn the mapping from structural and electrophysiological inputs to LAT fields. With a mean prediction error of 5.1 ms over a 455 ms maximum simulation time, the model outperforms established operator-learning approaches and performs inference in 0.12 ms per sample. Our framework establishes a general strategy for learning domain-invariant biophysical mappings across variable anatomical domains and enables integration of computational electrophysiology into real-time and large-scale clinical workflows.

Motivation: 分布式和联邦学习中，为减少通信开销通常进行多次本地更新，但由于节点间数据异构性和本地梯度噪声，会导致本地模型偏离全局最优解。需要解决这一漂移问题。

Conclusion: ST-GT算法通过时空梯度跟踪有效解决了分布式学习中的数据异构和噪声问题，显著提高了通信效率，在时变图上实现了优越的收敛性能。

Abstract: In distributed and federated learning algorithms, communication overhead is often reduced by performing multiple local updates between communication rounds. However, due to data heterogeneity across nodes and the local gradient noise within each node, this strategy can lead to the drift of local models away from the global optimum. To address this issue, we revisit the well-known federated learning method Scaffold (Karimireddy et al., 2020) under a gradient tracking perspective, and propose a unified spatio-temporal gradient tracking algorithm, termed ST-GT, for distributed stochastic optimization over time-varying graphs. ST-GT tracks the global gradient across neighboring nodes to mitigate data heterogeneity, while maintaining a running average of local gradients to substantially suppress noise, with slightly more storage overhead. Without assuming bounded data heterogeneity, we prove that ST-GT attains a linear convergence rate for strongly convex problems and a sublinear rate for nonconvex cases. Notably, ST-GT achieves the first linear speed-up in communication complexity with respect to the number of local updates per round $τ$ for the strongly-convex setting. Compared to traditional gradient tracking methods, ST-GT reduces the topology-dependent noise term from $σ^2$ to $σ^2/τ$, where $σ^2$ denotes the noise level, thereby improving communication efficiency.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM)-based agentic frameworks increasingly adopt the paradigm of dynamically generating task-specific agents. We suggest that not only agents but also specialized software modules for scientific and engineering tasks can be generated on demand. We demonstrate this concept in the field of solid mechanics. There, so-called constitutive models are required to describe the relationship between mechanical stress and body deformation. Constitutive models are essential for both the scientific understanding and industrial application of materials. However, even recent data-driven methods of constitutive modeling, such as constitutive artificial neural networks (CANNs), still require substantial expert knowledge and human labor. We present a framework in which an LLM generates a CANN on demand, tailored to a given material class and dataset provided by the user. The framework covers LLM-based architecture selection, integration of physical constraints, and complete code generation. Evaluation on three benchmark problems demonstrates that LLM-generated CANNs achieve accuracy comparable to or greater than manually engineered counterparts, while also exhibiting reliable generalization to unseen loading scenarios and extrapolation to large deformations. These findings indicate that LLM-based generation of physics-constrained neural networks can substantially reduce the expertise required for constitutive modeling and represent a step toward practical end-to-end automation.

Motivation: 工业级物理模拟的神经求解器面临关键可扩展性挑战：需要同时高效捕获数百万空间元素间的细粒度局部相互作用和长程全局依赖关系。

Conclusion: MSPT架构通过创新的多尺度注意力机制和球树分区策略，成功解决了大规模物理模拟的可扩展性挑战，在单GPU上实现了对百万级点的高效处理。

Abstract: A key scalability challenge in neural solvers for industrial-scale physics simulations is efficiently capturing both fine-grained local interactions and long-range global dependencies across millions of spatial elements. We introduce the Multi-Scale Patch Transformer (MSPT), an architecture that combines local point attention within patches with global attention to coarse patch-level representations. To partition the input domain into spatially-coherent patches, we employ ball trees, which handle irregular geometries efficiently. This dual-scale design enables MSPT to scale to millions of points on a single GPU. We validate our method on standard PDE benchmarks (elasticity, plasticity, fluid dynamics, porous flow) and large-scale aerodynamic datasets (ShapeNet-Car, Ahmed-ML), achieving state-of-the-art accuracy with substantially lower memory footprint and computational cost.

*Stella Etuk,Ashraf Matrawy*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SA-ADP是一种基于敏感性的自适应差分隐私方法，通过根据个人身份信息（PII）的敏感性分配噪声，在保持强隐私保护的同时不降低模型效用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLM）的记忆能力引发了隐私担忧，传统差分隐私方法（如DP-SGD）通过均匀加噪保护PII，但以牺牲模型效用为代价，需要在隐私保护和模型效用之间权衡。

Method: 提出SA-ADP（敏感性感知自适应差分隐私）方法，根据个体PII的敏感性分配噪声，而不是对所有数据应用均匀噪声。

Result: 在四个数据集（ABCD、CUSTOMERSIM、Wikitext-2和UNSW-NB15）上的评估显示，SA-ADP在保持强隐私保护的同时，实现了与基线（No-DP）和传统DP-SGD相当的结果。

Conclusion: SA-ADP方法能够在保持强隐私保护的同时不降低模型效用，解决了传统差分隐私方法中隐私保护与模型效用之间的权衡问题。

Abstract: Despite advances in the use of large language models (LLMs) in downstream tasks, their ability to memorize information has raised privacy concerns. Therefore, protecting personally identifiable information (PII) during LLM training remains a fundamental challenge. Conventional methods like Differential Privacy-Stochastic Gradient Descent (DP-SGD) provide robust privacy protection via uniform noising, protecting PII regardless of its distinct sensitivity. This comes at the expense of the model's utility, leading to a trade-off. In this paper, we propose SA-ADP, a sensitivity-aware approach that allocates noise based on the sensitivity of individual PII. We evaluated our method on four datasets (ABCD, CUSTOMERSIM, Wikitext-2, and UNSW-NB15 ). Our results show that SA-ADP achieves results comparable to the baseline (No-DP) and the conventional DP-SGD. This means that our method did not degrade the model's utility while still maintaining strong privacy protection.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MOFs是具有巨大组合设计空间和强结构-性能耦合的有序可设计材料，但此前缺乏高性能生成模型。该研究旨在填补这一空白，实现金属节点、连接体和拓扑结构的同步发现。

Method: 开发了Mofasa全原子潜在扩散模型，能够联合采样原子位置、原子类型和晶格向量，支持多达500个原子的系统，避免了文献中常见的手工组装算法。

Result: Mofasa在生成金属有机框架方面达到最先进性能，并发布了MofasaDB——包含数十万个采样MOF结构的标注库，以及用户友好的网络界面https://mofux.ai/。

Conclusion: Mofasa为MOF生成提供了高性能的通用潜在扩散模型，通过避免手工组装算法解锁了金属节点、连接体和拓扑结构的同步发现，为科学社区提供了有价值的工具和数据库。

Abstract: Mofasa is an all-atom latent diffusion model with state-of-the-art performance for generating Metal-Organic Frameworks (MOFs). These are highly porous crystalline materials used to harvest water from desert air, capture carbon dioxide, store toxic gases and catalyse chemical reactions. In recognition of their value, the development of MOFs recently received a Nobel Prize in Chemistry.
  In many ways, MOFs are well-suited for exploiting generative models in chemistry: they are rationally-designable materials with a large combinatorial design space and strong structure-property couplings. And yet, to date, a high performance generative model has been lacking. To fill this gap, we introduce Mofasa, a general-purpose latent diffusion model that jointly samples positions, atom-types and lattice vectors for systems as large as 500 atoms. Mofasa avoids handcrafted assembly algorithms common in the literature, unlocking the simultaneous discovery of metal nodes, linkers and topologies.
  To help the scientific community build on our work, we release MofasaDB, an annotated library of hundreds of thousands of sampled MOF structures, along with a user-friendly web interface for search and discovery: https://mofux.ai/ .

Motivation: 探索权重作为有效表示的潜力，特别是在神经场中。研究者希望了解通过约束优化空间是否能在权重空间中诱导出结构，从而提升表示质量。

Method: 使用预训练的基础模型和低秩适应(LoRA)技术来约束优化空间，研究乘法LoRA权重在2D和3D数据上的重建、生成和分析任务中的表现。

Result: 乘法LoRA权重在表示质量方面表现优异，同时展现出良好的区分性和语义结构。当与潜在扩散模型结合使用时，乘法LoRA权重能够实现比现有权重空间方法更高质量的生成效果。

Conclusion: 权重可以作为有效的表示形式，通过预训练基础模型和LoRA约束优化空间可以在权重空间中诱导出结构，乘法LoRA权重在多种任务中表现出色，特别是在生成任务中优于现有方法。

Abstract: In this work, we investigate the potential of weights to serve as effective representations, focusing on neural fields. Our key insight is that constraining the optimization space through a pre-trained base model and low-rank adaptation (LoRA) can induce structure in weight space. Across reconstruction, generation, and analysis tasks on 2D and 3D data, we find that multiplicative LoRA weights achieve high representation quality while exhibiting distinctiveness and semantic structure. When used with latent diffusion models, multiplicative LoRA weights enable higher-quality generation than existing weight-space methods.

TL;DR: LLR方法通过重训练最后一层来改善最差群体准确率，研究发现其有效性主要源于保留集的群体平衡性而非缓解神经崩溃。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究为什么简单的最后一层重训练方法能够有效纠正虚假相关性的依赖并提高少数群体的性能，即使保留集是训练集的不平衡子集。

Method: 通过实证研究分析LLR的有效性假设：首先检验神经崩溃缓解假设，然后提出并验证群体平衡假设，最后分析CB-LLR和AFR算法的隐含群体平衡机制。

Result: 研究发现LLR的成功主要源于保留集的群体平衡性，而非缓解神经崩溃。CB-LLR和AFR算法通过隐含的群体平衡机制实现鲁棒性提升。

Conclusion: 最后一层重训练的有效性主要依赖于保留集的群体平衡性，这为理解简单重训练方法如何改善模型鲁棒性提供了新的视角。

Abstract: Last-layer retraining (LLR) methods -- wherein the last layer of a neural network is reinitialized and retrained on a held-out set following ERM training -- have garnered interest as an efficient approach to rectify dependence on spurious correlations and improve performance on minority groups. Surprisingly, LLR has been found to improve worst-group accuracy even when the held-out set is an imbalanced subset of the training set. We initially hypothesize that this ``unreasonable effectiveness'' of LLR is explained by its ability to mitigate neural collapse through the held-out set, resulting in the implicit bias of gradient descent benefiting robustness. Our empirical investigation does not support this hypothesis. Instead, we present strong evidence for an alternative hypothesis: that the success of LLR is primarily due to better group balance in the held-out set. We conclude by showing how the recent algorithms CB-LLR and AFR perform implicit group-balancing to elicit a robustness improvement.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文研究RL后训练如何促进大语言模型的组合泛化能力，而非仅仅是长度泛化。通过Countdown任务分析模型解决方案的表达式树结构，发现RL能实现组合技能重用，但学习存在结构依赖的层次性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前RL在提升大语言模型推理能力时，其促进组合泛化（从已知组件合成新技能的能力）的作用常与简单的长度泛化混淆。需要澄清RL后训练在技能组合方面的具体作用，以及组合结构如何影响技能迁移。

Method: 聚焦Countdown任务（给定n个数字和目标值，构建表达式求值达到目标），将模型解决方案分析为表达式树，每个子树对应可重用的子任务（技能）。追踪训练过程中树形结构和成功率变化。

Result: 发现：(1) 对更大n和未见树形的分布外泛化，表明子任务的组合重用；(2) 结构依赖的学习层次性——模型先掌握浅层平衡树，后掌握深层不平衡树，对右重结构存在持续脆弱性（即使组合深度与左重结构相同）。

Conclusion: 诊断揭示了RL后训练学习的内容、顺序和泛化失败之处，阐明了仅通过RL后训练如何诱导超出标准指标（如pass@k）的分布外泛化，为理解RL在组合泛化中的作用提供了新视角。

Abstract: While reinforcement learning (RL) successfully enhances reasoning in large language models, its role in fostering compositional generalization (the ability to synthesize novel skills from known components) is often conflated with mere length generalization. To this end, we study what RL post-training teaches about skill composition and how the structure of the composition affects the skill transfer. We focus on the Countdown task (given n numbers and a target, form an expression that evaluates to the target) and analyze model solutions as expression trees, where each subtree corresponds to a reusable subtask and thus can be viewed as a ``skill.'' Tracking tree shapes and their success rates over training, we find: (i) out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization to larger n and to unseen tree shapes, indicating compositional reuse of subtasks; (ii) a structure-dependent hierarchy of learnability -- models master shallow balanced trees (workload is balanced between subtasks) before deep unbalanced ones, with persistent fragility on right-heavy structures (even when the composition depth is the same as some left-heavy structures). Our diagnostic reveals what is learned, in what order, and where generalization fails, clarifying how RL-only post-training induces OOD generalization beyond what standard metrics such as pass@k reveal.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出双随机平滑框架，通过输入依赖的噪声方差解决传统全局方差在小半径和大半径间的性能权衡问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统随机平滑使用全局噪声方差存在根本限制：无法同时在小半径和大半径上获得强性能。小半径需要小方差，大半径需要大方差，但全局方差无法兼顾两者。

Method: 提出双随机平滑框架：1) 证明输入依赖噪声方差在局部恒定条件下仍然有效；2) 设计方差估计器预测每个输入的最优噪声方差；3) 使用标准RS分类器处理估计的方差；4) 方差估计器本身通过RS平滑确保局部恒定性；5) 引入迭代训练策略优化两个组件。

Result: 在CIFAR-10上，双RS方法在小半径和大半径上均提供强性能（全局方差无法实现），推理计算开销仅增加60%。在半径0.5、0.75和1.0处相对改进分别达到19%、24%和21%。在ImageNet上同样有效。框架还提供路由视角改进准确率-鲁棒性权衡。

Conclusion: 双随机平滑框架通过输入依赖噪声方差突破了传统全局方差的限制，实现了在小半径和大半径上的同时强性能，为认证鲁棒性提供了新的路由视角。

Abstract: Randomized Smoothing (RS) is a prominent technique for certifying the robustness of neural networks against adversarial perturbations. With RS, achieving high accuracy at small radii requires a small noise variance, while achieving high accuracy at large radii requires a large noise variance. However, the global noise variance used in the standard RS formulation leads to a fundamental limitation: there exists no global noise variance that simultaneously achieves strong performance at both small and large radii. To break through the global variance limitation, we propose a dual RS framework which enables input-dependent noise variances. To achieve that, we first prove that RS remains valid with input-dependent noise variances, provided the variance is locally constant around each input. Building on this result, we introduce two components which form our dual RS framework: (i) a variance estimator first predicts an optimal noise variance for each input, (ii) this estimated variance is then used by a standard RS classifier. The variance estimator is independently smoothed via RS to ensure local constancy, enabling flexible design. We also introduce training strategies to iteratively optimize the two components. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10 show that our dual RS method provides strong performance for both small and large radii-unattainable with global noise variance-while incurring only a 60% computational overhead at inference. Moreover, it consistently outperforms prior input-dependent noise approaches across most radii, with particularly large gains at radii 0.5, 0.75, and 1.0, achieving relative improvements of 19%, 24%, and 21%, respectively. On ImageNet, dual RS remains effective across all radii. Additionally, the dual RS framework naturally provides a routing perspective for certified robustness, improving the accuracy-robustness trade-off with off-the-shelf expert RS models.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文首次研究战略环境下的主动学习算法，提出一种改进的主动感知器算法，能在战略操纵存在时保持指数级标签效率提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统主动学习在战略分类场景中面临挑战，因为代理会操纵特征以获得有利结果，导致数据不真实。需要设计既能处理战略操纵又能保持主动学习效率的算法。

Method: 提出改进的主动感知器算法（Active Perceptron），适用于战略环境中学习线性分离器。算法在单位球面上均匀分布的数据上工作，即使在不可实现情况下也能有效运行。

Result: 算法仅需 $\tilde{O}(d \ln \frac{1}ε)$ 标签查询就能达到 $ε$ 超额误差，相比最优分类器最多产生 $\tilde{O}(d \ln \frac{1}ε)$ 额外错误。计算效率高，标签查询需求显著少于先前工作。

Conclusion: 首次在战略分类中实现了主动学习的指数级效率提升，为招聘、录取、贷款决策等战略环境中的高效分类提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: We initiate the study of active learning algorithms for classifying strategic agents. Active learning is a well-established framework in machine learning in which the learner selectively queries labels, often achieving substantially higher accuracy and efficiency than classical supervised methods-especially in settings where labeling is costly or time-consuming, such as hiring, admissions, and loan decisions. Strategic classification, however, addresses scenarios where agents modify their features to obtain more favorable outcomes, resulting in observed data that is not truthful. Such manipulation introduces challenges beyond those in learning from clean data. Our goal is to design active and noise-tolerant algorithms that remain effective in strategic environments-algorithms that classify strategic agents accurately while issuing as few label requests as possible. The central difficulty is to simultaneously account for strategic manipulation and preserve the efficiency gains of active learning.
  Our main result is an algorithm for actively learning linear separators in the strategic setting that preserves the exponential improvement in label complexity over passive learning previously obtained only in the non-strategic case. Specifically, for data drawn uniformly from the unit sphere, we show that a modified version of the Active Perceptron algorithm [DKM05,YZ17] achieves excess error $ε$ using only $\tilde{O}(d \ln \frac{1}ε)$ label queries and incurs at most $\tilde{O}(d \ln \frac{1}ε)$ additional mistakes relative to the optimal classifier, even in the nonrealizable case, when a $\tildeΩ(ε)$ fraction of inputs have inconsistent labels with the optimal classifier. The algorithm is computationally efficient and, under these distributional assumptions, requires substantially fewer label queries than prior work on strategic Perceptron [ABBN21].

Motivation: 深度神经网络存在灾难性遗忘问题，即训练新任务后对先前任务的性能下降。现有方法需要平衡记忆和正则化，但通常依赖于类别信息或计算复杂。

Method: 提出信息最大化（IM）正则化器，仅基于期望标签分布，是类无关的。该正则化器可直接集成到各种基于记忆的持续学习方法中，通过最大化信息保留来减少遗忘。

Conclusion: IM正则化器是一种轻量级、实用且可扩展的解决方案，适用于实际持续学习场景，能有效减少灾难性遗忘并加速收敛，具有广泛适用性。

Abstract: Deep neural networks suffer from catastrophic forgetting, where performance on previous tasks degrades after training on a new task. This issue arises due to the model's tendency to overwrite previously acquired knowledge with new information. We present a novel approach to address this challenge, focusing on the intersection of memory-based methods and regularization approaches. We formulate a regularization strategy, termed Information Maximization (IM) regularizer, for memory-based continual learning methods, which is based exclusively on the expected label distribution, thus making it class-agnostic. As a consequence, IM regularizer can be directly integrated into various rehearsal-based continual learning methods, reducing forgetting and favoring faster convergence. Our empirical validation shows that, across datasets and regardless of the number of tasks, our proposed regularization strategy consistently improves baseline performance at the expense of a minimal computational overhead. The lightweight nature of IM ensures that it remains a practical and scalable solution, making it applicable to real-world continual learning scenarios where efficiency is paramount. Finally, we demonstrate the data-agnostic nature of our regularizer by applying it to video data, which presents additional challenges due to its temporal structure and higher memory requirements. Despite the significant domain gap, our experiments show that IM regularizer also improves the performance of video continual learning methods.

Conclusion: 提出的基于信息瓶颈的诊断框架能够系统分析离散潜在生成模型的多样性行为，揭示了不同模型的策略差异，并为理解和改进生成多样性提供了理论基础和实用工具。

Abstract: Generative diversity varies significantly across discrete latent generative models such as AR, MIM, and Diffusion. We propose a diagnostic framework, grounded in Information Bottleneck (IB) theory, to analyze the underlying strategies resolving this behavior. The framework models generation as a conflict between a 'Compression Pressure' - a drive to minimize overall codebook entropy - and a 'Diversity Pressure' - a drive to maximize conditional entropy given an input. We further decompose this diversity into two primary sources: 'Path Diversity', representing the choice of high-level generative strategies, and 'Execution Diversity', the randomness in executing a chosen strategy. To make this decomposition operational, we introduce three zero-shot, inference-time interventions that directly perturb the latent generative process and reveal how models allocate and express diversity. Application of this probe-based framework to representative AR, MIM, and Diffusion systems reveals three distinct strategies: "Diversity-Prioritized" (MIM), "Compression-Prioritized" (AR), and "Decoupled" (Diffusion). Our analysis provides a principled explanation for their behavioral differences and informs a novel inference-time diversity enhancement technique.

Motivation: 抑郁症音频检测模型因训练数据不平衡（女性患病率更高）而存在性别偏见，导致模型过度诊断女性患者而对男性患者表现不佳，引发公平性问题。

Method: 提出基于因果推理的反事实去偏框架：构建因果图建模决策过程，识别性别偏见为性别对预测的直接因果效应；在推理阶段使用反事实推理估计并减去该直接效应，确保模型主要依赖真实的声学病理特征。

Result: 在DAIC-WOZ数据集上使用两种先进声学骨干网络的实验表明，该框架不仅显著减少性别偏见，而且相比现有去偏策略提高了整体检测性能。

Conclusion: 提出的反事实去偏框架能有效解决抑郁症音频检测中的性别偏见问题，同时提升模型性能，为构建更公平的医疗AI系统提供了新思路。

Abstract: Audio-based depression detection models have demonstrated promising performance but often suffer from gender bias due to imbalanced training data. Epidemiological statistics show a higher prevalence of depression in females, leading models to learn spurious correlations between gender and depression. Consequently, models tend to over-diagnose female patients while underperforming on male patients, raising significant fairness concerns. To address this, we propose a novel Counterfactual Debiasing Framework grounded in causal inference. We construct a causal graph to model the decision-making process and identify gender bias as the direct causal effect of gender on the prediction. During inference, we employ counterfactual inference to estimate and subtract this direct effect, ensuring the model relies primarily on authentic acoustic pathological features. Extensive experiments on the DAIC-WOZ dataset using two advanced acoustic backbones demonstrate that our framework not only significantly reduces gender bias but also improves overall detection performance compared to existing debiasing strategies.

Motivation: 为理解Transformer注意力机制的内在动力学，特别是表征崩溃和多聚类结构保持的机制，需要建立数学框架来分析其连续极限。

Method: 将Transformer注意力理想化为球面上的连续系统，建模为相互作用的粒子系统，研究其连续（平均场）极限，连接Wasserstein梯度流、Kuramoto同步模型和均值漂移聚类，并进行可处理的等角约简分析。

Result: 发现全局聚类现象：token在长时间亚稳态后渐近聚类；获得精确聚类速率；展示常用归一化方案如何改变收缩速度；识别长上下文注意力的相变。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了驱动表征崩溃的机制，以及深度注意力架构中保持表达性多聚类结构的机制，为理解Transformer动力学提供了数学基础。

Abstract: We develop a mathematical framework that interprets Transformer attention as an interacting particle system and studies its continuum (mean-field) limits. By idealizing attention continuous on the sphere, we connect Transformer dynamics to Wasserstein gradient flows, synchronization models (Kuramoto), and mean-shift clustering. Central to our results is a global clustering phenomenon whereby tokens cluster asymptotically after long metastable states where they are arranged into multiple clusters. We further analyze a tractable equiangular reduction to obtain exact clustering rates, show how commonly used normalization schemes alter contraction speeds, and identify a phase transition for long-context attention. The results highlight both the mechanisms that drive representation collapse and the regimes that preserve expressive, multi-cluster structure in deep attention architectures.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前优化方法存在静态折衷问题：基于梯度幅值的方法（如AdamW）在平滑区域精度高，但在崎岖非凸地形中会放大噪声；基于符号的方法（如Lion）通过1位量化提供鲁棒性，但丢弃了精细下降信息。需要一种能动态调节更新比特率的优化方法。

Method: 提出ThermoLion框架：1）利用局部信噪比门控机制，根据参数状态在低比特探索和高精度利用阶段之间自主切换；2）引入动量对齐机制，检测历史漂移与瞬时梯度之间的建设性干扰，在稳定轨迹上加速收敛。

Result: 在12个多样化视觉数据集（包括CIFAR、SVHN、GTSRB）上的实验表明，ThermoLion作为无需超参数调优的通用优化器，在收敛速度和最终精度上均超越了AdamW和Lion，且无需针对特定架构进行调整。

Conclusion: 深度视觉模型的训练本质上是高维随机噪声中的信号恢复问题，最优收敛需要动态调节更新比特率而非静态折衷。ThermoLion通过局部SNR门控和动量对齐机制实现了这一目标，为视觉任务提供了高效且鲁棒的优化解决方案。

Abstract: The training of deep vision models is fundamentally a signal recovery problem amidst high-dimensional stochastic noise. Current optimization paradigms impose a static compromise on information channel capacity. For instance, magnitude-based methods, such as AdamW, operate on the assumption that gradient norms are high-fidelity curvature signals. While this allows for precision in smooth regimes, it leads to catastrophic noise amplification when applied to rugged, non-convex landscapes. Conversely, sign-based methods (e.g., Lion) perform a radical 1-bit quantization of the gradient, which aims to provide robust regularization at the cost of discarding fine-grained descent information. We propose that optimal convergence requires neither static prior, but rather a dynamic modulation of the update bitrate. We introduce \textbf{ThermoLion}, a vision-centric framework that utilizes local Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) gating to autonomously transition parameters between a "low-bit" exploration phase and a "high-precision" exploitation phase. Furthermore, we introduce a Momentum Alignment mechanism that detects constructive interference between historical drift and instantaneous gradients to accelerate convergence during stable trajectories. Empirical benchmarks across 12 diverse vision datasets (including CIFAR, SVHN, and GTSRB) demonstrate that ThermoLion serves as a hyperparameter-free generalist, surpassing both AdamW and Lion in convergence speed and terminal accuracy without architecture-specific tuning.

Conclusion: 提出的尖峰时序感知类Transformer架构能够克服传统Transformer的高计算成本问题，为资源受限边缘环境中的实时自动驾驶决策提供了有效的解决方案

Abstract: This work proposes an end-to-end multi-modal reinforcement learning framework for high-level decision-making in autonomous vehicles. The framework integrates heterogeneous sensory input, including camera images, LiDAR point clouds, and vehicle heading information, through a cross-attention transformer-based perception module. Although transformers have become the backbone of modern multi-modal architectures, their high computational cost limits their deployment in resource-constrained edge environments. To overcome this challenge, we propose a spiking temporal-aware transformer-like architecture that uses ternary spiking neurons for computationally efficient multi-modal fusion. Comprehensive evaluations across multiple tasks in the Highway Environment demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed approach for real-time autonomous decision-making.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于图神经网络（GNN）的物理启发式代理模型，结合域分解（DD）策略和迁移学习，用于高效模拟偏微分方程（PDE），特别适用于冰盖模拟等大规模不确定性量化任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模偏微分方程模拟需要准确且高效的代理模型，特别是在不确定性量化任务中需要数百甚至数千次评估。现有方法在处理非结构化网格和大规模系统时面临效率和泛化能力的挑战。

Method: 开发了物理启发的图神经网络（GNN）代理模型，直接在非结构化网格上运行并利用图注意力机制。引入域分解策略将网格划分为子域，并行训练局部GNN代理，然后聚合预测。采用迁移学习在子域间微调模型，加速训练并提高数据有限情况下的准确性。

Result: 应用于冰盖模拟时，该方法能够准确预测高分辨率网格上的全场速度，相对于训练单一全局代理模型显著减少了训练时间，为不确定性量化目标提供了坚实基础。

Conclusion: 基于图的域分解结合迁移学习为大规模PDE控制系统的GNN代理训练提供了可扩展且可靠的途径，在冰盖动力学之外具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Accurate yet efficient surrogate models are essential for large-scale simulations of partial differential equations (PDEs), particularly for uncertainty quantification (UQ) tasks that demand hundreds or thousands of evaluations. We develop a physics-inspired graph neural network (GNN) surrogate that operates directly on unstructured meshes and leverages the flexibility of graph attention. To improve both training efficiency and generalization properties of the model, we introduce a domain decomposition (DD) strategy that partitions the mesh into subdomains, trains local GNN surrogates in parallel, and aggregates their predictions. We then employ transfer learning to fine-tune models across subdomains, accelerating training and improving accuracy in data-limited settings. Applied to ice sheet simulations, our approach accurately predicts full-field velocities on high-resolution meshes, substantially reduces training time relative to training a single global surrogate model, and provides a ripe foundation for UQ objectives. Our results demonstrate that graph-based DD, combined with transfer learning, provides a scalable and reliable pathway for training GNN surrogates on massive PDE-governed systems, with broad potential for application beyond ice sheet dynamics.

TL;DR: EWC方法在知识图谱持续学习中显著减少灾难性遗忘，任务划分策略对遗忘程度有重要影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 知识图谱需要持续更新，但神经嵌入模型在顺序学习新任务时会出现灾难性遗忘问题。需要评估持续学习方法在知识图谱链接预测任务中的效果。

Method: 使用弹性权重巩固（EWC）方法，在FB15k-237数据集上评估TransE嵌入模型的持续学习性能。采用两种任务划分策略：基于关系的划分和随机划分，并进行五次随机种子实验。

Result: EWC将灾难性遗忘从12.62%减少到6.85%，减少了45.7%。基于关系划分的任务遗忘率（12.62%）比随机划分（2.81%）高9.8个百分点，表明任务构建方式影响评估结果。

Conclusion: EWC能有效缓解知识图谱持续学习中的灾难性遗忘，同时评估协议设计对结果有重要影响。虽然研究限于单一嵌入模型和数据集，但为KG持续学习提供了有价值的见解。

Abstract: Knowledge graphs (KGs) require continual updates as new information emerges, but neural embedding models suffer from catastrophic forgetting when learning new tasks sequentially. We evaluate Elastic Weight Consolidation (EWC), a regularization-based continual learning method, on KG link prediction using TransE embeddings on FB15k-237. Across multiple experiments with five random seeds, we find that EWC reduces catastrophic forgetting from 12.62% to 6.85%, a 45.7% reduction compared to naive sequential training. We observe that the task partitioning strategy affects the magnitude of forgetting: relation-based partitioning (grouping triples by relation type) exhibits 9.8 percentage points higher forgetting than randomly partitioned tasks (12.62% vs 2.81%), suggesting that task construction influences evaluation outcomes. While focused on a single embedding model and dataset, our results demonstrate that EWC effectively mitigates catastrophic forgetting in KG continual learning and highlight the importance of evaluation protocol design.

TL;DR: 提出一个可证明安全模型更新的框架，通过计算参数空间中最大的局部不变域来保证更新后的模型满足性能规范


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 安全关键环境是动态变化的，需要持续更新机器学习模型，但即使是良性的参数更新也可能导致意外后果（如灾难性遗忘或对齐漂移）。现有启发式方法无法证明更新后的模型继续满足性能规范。

Method: 将问题形式化为计算最大的局部不变域（LID）——参数空间中所有点都被证明满足给定规范的连通区域。通过放松到参数化抽象域（正交体、zonotopes）获得可处理的原始-对偶公式，实现高效认证。

Result: 在持续学习和基础模型微调基准测试中，该方法匹配或超过避免遗忘的启发式基线，同时提供正式的安全保证。

Conclusion: 该框架为动态安全关键环境中的模型更新提供了可证明的安全保证，解决了现有启发式方法无法提供形式化认证的问题。

Abstract: Safety-critical environments are inherently dynamic. Distribution shifts, emerging vulnerabilities, and evolving requirements demand continuous updates to machine learning models. Yet even benign parameter updates can have unintended consequences, such as catastrophic forgetting in classical models or alignment drift in foundation models. Existing heuristic approaches (e.g., regularization, parameter isolation) can mitigate these effects but cannot certify that updated models continue to satisfy required performance specifications. We address this problem by introducing a framework for provably safe model updates. Our approach first formalizes the problem as computing the largest locally invariant domain (LID): a connected region in parameter space where all points are certified to satisfy a given specification. While exact maximal LID computation is intractable, we show that relaxing the problem to parameterized abstract domains (orthotopes, zonotopes) yields a tractable primal-dual formulation. This enables efficient certification of updates - independent of the data or algorithm used - by projecting them onto the safe domain. Our formulation further allows computation of multiple approximately optimal LIDs, incorporation of regularization-inspired biases, and use of lookahead data buffers. Across continual learning and foundation model fine-tuning benchmarks, our method matches or exceeds heuristic baselines for avoiding forgetting while providing formal safety guarantees.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种通用的延迟机制框架，通过额外的状态变量将延迟整合到脉冲神经网络中，使神经元能够访问有限的时序输入历史，从而提高网络性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 脉冲神经网络（SNNs）作为生物启发的、事件驱动的模型，适合处理时序数据且在神经形态硬件上能实现高效能计算。延迟在SNNs中扮演关键角色，允许过去的输入直接影响当前的脉冲行为，从而捕获更复杂的时序依赖关系。然而，现有方法缺乏一个通用的延迟整合框架。

Method: 提出一个通用框架，通过引入额外的状态变量将延迟机制整合到SNNs中。该框架与神经元模型无关，可无缝集成到标准脉冲神经元模型（如LIF和adLIF）中。每个神经元通过延迟机制能够访问有限的时序输入历史，并分析了延迟持续时间及相关可学习参数对性能的影响。

Result: 在Spiking Heidelberg Digits (SHD)数据集上的实验表明，所提出的延迟机制在保持计算效率的同时，性能与现有的基于延迟的SNNs相当。更重要的是，结果显示在较小的网络中引入延迟可以显著提升性能。

Conclusion: 提出的通用延迟框架为SNNs提供了一种有效整合时序信息的方法，特别适用于小型网络，在保持计算效率的同时显著提升性能，为处理复杂时序依赖关系提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Spiking neural networks (SNNs) are biologically inspired, event-driven models that are suitable for processing temporal data and offer energy-efficient computation when implemented on neuromorphic hardware. In SNNs, richer neuronal dynamic allows capturing more complex temporal dependencies, with delays playing a crucial role by allowing past inputs to directly influence present spiking behavior. We propose a general framework for incorporating delays into SNNs through additional state variables. The proposed mechanism enables each neuron to access a finite temporal input history. The framework is agnostic to neuron models and hence can be seamlessly integrated into standard spiking neuron models such as LIF and adLIF. We analyze how the duration of the delays and the learnable parameters associated with them affect the performance. We investigate the trade-offs in the network architecture due to additional state variables introduced by the delay mechanism. Experiments on the Spiking Heidelberg Digits (SHD) dataset show that the proposed mechanism matches the performance of existing delay-based SNNs while remaining computationally efficient. Moreover, the results illustrate that the incorporation of delays may substantially improve performance in smaller networks.

Conclusion: FAR框架成功解决了卫星观测尺度与通量塔足迹不匹配问题，为大规模生态系统碳监测提供了有效工具

Abstract: Natural climate solutions (NCS) offer an approach to mitigating carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. However, monitoring the carbon drawdown of ecosystems over large geographic areas remains challenging. Eddy-flux covariance towers provide ground truth for predictive 'upscaling' models derived from satellite products, but many satellites now produce measurements on spatial scales smaller than a flux tower's footprint. We introduce Footprint-Aware Regression (FAR), a first-of-its-kind, deep-learning framework that simultaneously predicts spatial footprints and pixel-level (30 m scale) estimates of carbon flux. FAR is trained on our AMERI-FAR25 dataset which combines 439 site years of tower data with corresponding Landsat scenes. Our model produces high-resolution predictions and achieves R2 = 0.78 when predicting monthly net ecosystem exchange on test sites from a variety of ecosystems.

Abstract: Stochastic Variance Reduced Gradient (SVRG) and its variants aim to speed-up training by using gradient corrections, but have seen limited success in deep learning. Here, we show surprising new foundational connections of SVRG to a recently proposed Bayesian method called posterior correction. Specifically, we show that SVRG is recovered as a special case of posterior correction over the isotropic-Gaussian family, while novel extensions are automatically obtained by using more flexible exponential families. We derive two new SVRG variants by using Gaussian families: First, a Newton-like variant that employs novel Hessian corrections, and second, an Adam-like extension that improves pretraining and finetuning of Transformer language models. This is the first work to connect SVRG to Bayes and use it to boost variational training for deep networks.

TL;DR: INSPO是一个指令-策略协同进化框架，通过动态优化指令来提升强化学习代理的性能，在多次检索和推理任务中显著优于静态指令基线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RLVR方法依赖静态手动设计的指令，但这些指令可能对基础模型不是最优的，且随着策略改进和环境交互探索，最优指令会发生变化。需要动态指令优化来弥合这一差距。

Method: INSPO框架将指令优化集成到RL循环中，维护动态指令候选池，通过RL奖励信号自动评估指令，定期淘汰低性能指令，并基于回放缓冲区的经验通过LLM优化器生成和验证新指令。

Result: 在多次检索和推理任务上的实验表明，INSPO显著优于依赖静态指令的强基线方法，能够发现创新性指令引导代理采取更战略性的推理路径，仅以边际计算开销实现实质性性能提升。

Conclusion: INSPO通过指令-策略协同进化有效解决了静态指令的局限性，为强化学习代理提供了动态优化的指令，显著提升了多轮推理和工具集成任务中的性能。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has advanced the reasoning capability of large language models (LLMs), enabling autonomous agents that can conduct effective multi-turn and tool-integrated reasoning. While instructions serve as the primary protocol for defining agents, RLVR typically relies on static and manually designed instructions. However, those instructions may be suboptimal for the base model, and the optimal instruction may change as the agent's policy improves and explores the interaction with the environment. To bridge the gap, we introduce INSPO, a novel Instruction-Policy co-evolution framework that integrates instruction optimization as a dynamic component of the reinforcement learning (RL) loop. INSPO maintains a dynamic population of instruction candidates that are sampled with questions, where reward signals in RL loops are automatically attributed to each instruction, and low performers are periodically pruned. New instructions are generated and verified through an on-policy reflection mechanism, where an LLM-based optimizer analyzes past experience from a replay buffer and evolves more effective strategies given the current policy. We conduct extensive experiments on multi-turn retrieval and reasoning tasks, demonstrating that INSPO substantially outperforms strong baselines relying on static instructions. INSPO discovers innovative instructions that guide the agent toward more strategic reasoning paths, achieving substantial performance gains with only a marginal increase in computational overhead.

TL;DR: KV Pareto框架系统性地探索KV缓存量化、分块预填充和模型权重量化三种技术的联合优化，在长上下文LLM推理中实现68-78%内存降低，仅带来1-3%精度损失。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 长上下文大语言模型在推理时面临显著的内存瓶颈，因为KV缓存随序列长度线性增长。虽然KV缓存量化、分块预填充和模型权重量化等单独优化技术已显示出潜力，但它们的联合效果和边缘部署的最优配置仍未充分探索。

Method: 引入KV Pareto系统级框架，系统性地映射三种互补优化技术（KV缓存量化、分块预填充、AWQ 4-bit权重量化）在总内存消耗和任务精度之间的权衡边界。评估多种LLM架构（Qwen、Llama、Mistral），不同KV量化方案（int2/4/8、混合精度）、粒度（per-token、per-tensor、per-block）和4-bit AWQ权重量化。

Result: 框架识别出模型特定的帕累托最优配置，在长上下文任务上实现68-78%的总内存降低，仅带来1-3%的精度损失。在Needle-in-a-Haystack、GSM8k和MMLU等额外基准测试以及扩展到128k上下文长度上验证了所选边界。

Conclusion: 联合优化对于高效LLM推理具有实际必要性，KV Pareto框架为边缘部署提供了系统性的配置优化方法，在显著降低内存消耗的同时保持模型精度。

Abstract: Long-context Large Language Models (LLMs) face significant memory bottlenecks during inference due to the linear growth of key-value (KV) cache with sequence length. While individual optimization techniques like KV cache quantization, chunked prefill, and model weight quantization have shown promise, their joint effects and optimal configurations for edge deployment remain underexplored. We introduce KV Pareto, a systems-level framework that systematically maps the trade-off frontier between total memory consumption and task accuracy across these three complementary optimization techniques. Our framework evaluates multiple LLM architectures (Qwen, Llama, Mistral) with varying KV quantization schemes (int2/4/8, mixed-precision), granularities (per-token, per-tensor, per-block), and 4-bit weight quantization via AWQ. Our framework identifies model-specific Pareto-optimal configurations that achieve 68-78% total memory reduction with minimal (1-3%) accuracy degradation on long-context tasks. We additionally verify the selected frontiers on additional benchmarks of Needle-in-a-Haystack, GSM8k and MMLU as well as extended context lengths of up to 128k to demonstrate the practical need of joint optimization for efficient LLM inference.

TL;DR: 提出Low-Rank Prehab方法，在SVD压缩前进行预调优，使权重矩阵更易低秩近似，减少压缩后精度损失并提升恢复效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 受外科手术中"预康复"概念启发，传统SVD压缩方法先压缩后微调，但压缩时精度损失较大。希望通过压缩前预调优，使模型权重更适应低秩近似。

Method: 引入预压缩微调阶段Low-Rank Prehab，在SVD压缩前显式鼓励权重矩阵的低秩结构，同时保持任务性能。通过将权重引导至谱紧凑的参数空间区域，实现更平滑的低秩近似。

Result: 在LLMs和Transformer架构（包括ViTs）上的实验表明，Prehab显著减少压缩后立即的精度下降，并持续改善后微调性能。在各种压缩比下均优于SVD-LLM等SOTA方法。

Conclusion: 为压缩准备模型比仅改进压缩和恢复阶段更重要。Prehab方法通过预调优使模型更适应低秩压缩，为神经网络压缩提供了新思路。

Abstract: Low-rank approximation methods such as singular value decomposition (SVD) and its variants (e.g., Fisher-weighted SVD, Activation SVD) have recently emerged as effective tools for neural network compression. In this setting, decomposition acts as a "surgical" intervention, followed by fine-tuning that serves as "rehab" to recover accuracy. Inspired by prehabilitation in surgery, we introduce a pre-compression fine-tuning stage, Low-Rank Prehab, that explicitly encourages low-rank structure in weight matrices while preserving task performance. By conditioning the model before SVD, Prehab steers weights toward spectrally compact regions of the parameter space, enabling smoother low-rank approximation and improved recovery. Experiments on large language models (LLMs) and other Transformer-based architectures, including Vision Transformers (ViTs), show that Prehab substantially reduces the immediate accuracy drop after compression and consistently improves post-finetuning performance. Across a wide range of compression ratios, our method outperforms state-of-the-art SVD-based techniques such as SVD-LLM, highlighting the importance of preparing models for compression rather than only improving the compression and recovery stages.

TL;DR: FORL框架结合条件扩散模型和零样本时间序列基础模型，解决非平稳离线强化学习中的偏移问题，提升在真实世界环境中的性能表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有离线强化学习方法通常假设环境平稳或只考虑测试时的合成扰动，但这些假设在真实世界中经常失效。真实世界环境存在突然的、时变的偏移，导致部分可观测性，使智能体误判真实状态并降低性能。

Method: FORL框架统一了两个组件：(1) 条件扩散基的候选状态生成，训练时不预设任何特定的未来非平稳模式；(2) 零样本时间序列基础模型。该框架针对容易出现意外、可能非马尔可夫偏移的环境，要求智能体从每个episode开始就具备鲁棒性能。

Result: 在离线强化学习基准测试中，通过加入真实世界时间序列数据来模拟现实非平稳性，FORL相比竞争基线方法持续提升了性能表现。

Conclusion: 通过将零样本预测与智能体经验相结合，FORL旨在弥合离线强化学习与真实世界非平稳环境复杂性之间的差距，为处理现实世界中的非平稳性提供了一种有前景的解决方案。

Abstract: Offline Reinforcement Learning (RL) provides a promising avenue for training policies from pre-collected datasets when gathering additional interaction data is infeasible. However, existing offline RL methods often assume stationarity or only consider synthetic perturbations at test time, assumptions that often fail in real-world scenarios characterized by abrupt, time-varying offsets. These offsets can lead to partial observability, causing agents to misperceive their true state and degrade performance. To overcome this challenge, we introduce Forecasting in Non-stationary Offline RL (FORL), a framework that unifies (i) conditional diffusion-based candidate state generation, trained without presupposing any specific pattern of future non-stationarity, and (ii) zero-shot time-series foundation models. FORL targets environments prone to unexpected, potentially non-Markovian offsets, requiring robust agent performance from the onset of each episode. Empirical evaluations on offline RL benchmarks, augmented with real-world time-series data to simulate realistic non-stationarity, demonstrate that FORL consistently improves performance compared to competitive baselines. By integrating zero-shot forecasting with the agent's experience, we aim to bridge the gap between offline RL and the complexities of real-world, non-stationary environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型的隐藏参数空间难以检查和控制，传统稀疏自编码器产生的特征往往与人类定义的概念不对齐，导致特征纠缠和分布式表示，缺乏可解释的接口

Method: 采用"预训练-后训练"课程：先进行无监督训练，然后进行有监督后训练，将特定概念绑定到专用潜在槽位，同时保留剩余容量用于一般重构，实现特征与本体对齐

Result: AlignSAE能够实现精确的因果干预，如可靠的"概念交换"，通过针对单个语义对齐的槽位进行操作，创建了可解释的接口

Conclusion: AlignSAE方法有效解决了稀疏自编码器特征与人类概念对齐的问题，为LLM隐藏激活提供了更可控和可解释的表示，支持精确的概念级干预

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) encode factual knowledge within hidden parametric spaces that are difficult to inspect or control. While Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) can decompose hidden activations into more fine-grained, interpretable features, they often struggle to reliably align these features with human-defined concepts, resulting in entangled and distributed feature representations. To address this, we introduce AlignSAE, a method that aligns SAE features with a defined ontology through a "pre-train, then post-train" curriculum. After an initial unsupervised training phase, we apply supervised post-training to bind specific concepts to dedicated latent slots while preserving the remaining capacity for general reconstruction. This separation creates an interpretable interface where specific relations can be inspected and controlled without interference from unrelated features. Empirical results demonstrate that AlignSAE enables precise causal interventions, such as reliable "concept swaps", by targeting single, semantically aligned slots.

Conclusion: 将扩散模型与强化学习结合是有效的，通过将MaxEntRL重新解释为扩散采样问题，可以推导出简单但有效的扩散变体算法，这些算法只需对基础算法进行微小修改就能获得性能提升。

Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in data-driven learning and in sampling from complex, unnormalized target distributions. Building on this progress, we reinterpret Maximum Entropy Reinforcement Learning (MaxEntRL) as a diffusion model-based sampling problem. We tackle this problem by minimizing the reverse Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between the diffusion policy and the optimal policy distribution using a tractable upper bound. By applying the policy gradient theorem to this objective, we derive a modified surrogate objective for MaxEntRL that incorporates diffusion dynamics in a principled way. This leads to simple diffusion-based variants of Soft Actor-Critic (SAC), Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and Wasserstein Policy Optimization (WPO), termed DiffSAC, DiffPPO and DiffWPO. All of these methods require only minor implementation changes to their base algorithm. We find that on standard continuous control benchmarks, DiffSAC, DiffPPO and DiffWPO achieve better returns and higher sample efficiency than SAC and PPO.

Method: 将Montresor等人的分布式k-core算法适配到共享内存系统，用Rust实现三个版本：SequentialK（基线）、ParallelK（多线程消息传递）、FastK（减少同步开销）

Result: 在道路网络、Web图、社交网络等真实数据集上，FastK始终优于SequentialK和ParallelK，以及NetworkX的Python实现，在16线程上获得最高11倍加速，执行时间比Python实现快两个数量级

Conclusion: Rust实现的并行k-core分解算法能有效利用多核系统，显著提升性能，为大规模图分析提供了高效解决方案

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the parallelization of $k$-core decomposition, a method used in graph analysis to identify cohesive substructures and assess node centrality. Although efficient sequential algorithms exist for this task, the scale of modern networks requires faster, multicore-ready approaches. To this end, we adapt a distributed $k$-core algorithm originally proposed by Montresor et al. to shared-memory systems and implement it in Rust, leveraging the language's strengths in concurrency and memory safety. We developed three progressively optimized versions: SequentialK as a baseline, ParallelK introducing multi-threaded message passing, and FastK further reducing synchronization overhead. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets, including road networks, web graphs, and social networks, show that FastK consistently outperforms both SequentialK and ParallelK, as well as a reference Python implementation available in the NetworkX library. Results indicate up to an 11x speedup on 16 threads and execution times up to two orders of magnitude faster than the Python implementation.

*Bingzheng Xia,Zujie Ren,Kuang Ma,Xiaoqian Li,Wenda Li,Shuibing He*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: Heimdall++是Heimdall的优化版本，通过细粒度GPU并行化、增强内存管理和多线程框架，解决了GPU利用率不足的问题，在单文件处理上实现2.66倍加速，多文件批处理上实现2.05倍加速。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着现代射电望远镜时空分辨率提高和数据量指数增长，实时单脉冲检测成为关键需求。Heimdall作为GPU加速的单脉冲搜索工具，其顺序执行模型和中间处理阶段的资源争用限制了GPU利用率，导致吞吐量不足和计算延迟增加。

Method: 提出Heimdall++，采用细粒度GPU并行化、增强内存管理和多线程框架，解耦CPU绑定和GPU绑定的处理阶段，缓解GPU停滞问题，提高端到端效率。

Result: 在配备NVIDIA RTX 3080 Ti GPU的系统上测试，Heimdall++在单文件处理上实现2.66倍加速，多文件批处理上实现2.05倍加速，同时保持与原始Heimdall搜索结果完全一致。

Conclusion: Heimdall++通过优化GPU利用率和处理流水线，显著提升了单脉冲搜索性能，为大规模射电天文数据处理提供了更高效的解决方案。

Abstract: With the increasing time and frequency resolution of modern radio telescopes and the exponential growth in observational data volumes, real-time single-pulse detection has become a critical requirement for time-domain radio astronomy. Heimdall, as a representative GPU-accelerated single-pulse search tool, offers substantial performance advantages over CPU-based approaches. However, its sequential execution model and resource contention in intermediate processing stages limit GPU utilization, leading to suboptimal throughput and increased computational latency. To address these limitations, we present Heimdall++, an optimized successor to Heimdall that incorporates fine-grained GPU parallelization, enhanced memory management, and a multi-threaded framework to decouple CPU-bound and GPU-bound processing stages. This design mitigates the GPU stall problem and improves end-to-end efficiency. We evaluated Heimdall++ on a system equipped with NVIDIA RTX 3080 Ti GPUs using both a single large-scale observational file and multiple files. Experimental results demonstrate that Heimdall++ achieves up to 2.66x speedup in single-file processing and 2.05x speedup in multi-file batch processing, while maintaining full consistency with the original Heimdall's search results.

*Bala Siva Sai Akhil Malepati*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: IslandRun是一个多目标编排系统，将计算资源视为跨越个人设备、私有边缘服务器和公共云的自主"岛屿"，通过智能路由和可逆匿名化实现隐私感知的分散式推理编排。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代AI推理面临不可调和的矛盾：没有单一计算资源能同时最大化性能、保护隐私、最小化成本和保持信任。现有编排框架只优化单一维度，无法应对现实世界的异构性。

Method: 1) 基于代理的路由机制；2) 分层岛屿组（具有差异化信任级别）；3) 可逆匿名化技术；4) 类型化占位符净化以保持跨信任边界的上下文语义；5) 数据本地化实现"计算到数据"而非"数据到计算"。

Result: 建立了隐私感知、分散式推理编排的新范式，能够在异构个人计算生态系统中实现多目标优化，平衡性能、隐私、成本和信任等维度。

Conclusion: IslandRun通过将计算资源视为自主岛屿，结合智能路由和隐私保护机制，为AI推理编排提供了解决现实世界异构性的新方法，实现了在性能、隐私、成本和信任之间的更好平衡。

Abstract: Modern AI inference faces an irreducible tension: no single computational resource simultaneously maximizes performance, preserves privacy, minimizes cost, and maintains trust. Existing orchestration frameworks optimize single dimensions (Kubernetes prioritizes latency, federated learning preserves privacy, edge computing reduces network distance), creating solutions that struggle under real-world heterogeneity. We present IslandRun, a multi-objective orchestration system that treats computational resources as autonomous "islands" spanning personal devices, private edge servers, and public cloud. Our key insights: (1) request-level heterogeneity demands policy-constrained multi-objective optimization, (2) data locality enables routing compute to data rather than data to compute, and (3) typed placeholder sanitization preserves context semantics across trust boundaries. IslandRun introduces agent-based routing, tiered island groups with differential trust, and reversible anonymization. This establishes a new paradigm for privacy-aware, decentralized inference orchestration across heterogeneous personal computing ecosystems.

Abstract: Flying Ad-hoc Networks (FANETs), formed by Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), represent an emerging and promising communication paradigm. These networks face unique challenges due to UAVs high mobility, limited energy resources, and dynamic topology. In this work, we propose a novel multi-hop clustering algorithm aimed at creating stable, energy-efficient clusters in FANET environments. The proposed solution enhances cluster longevity and communication efficiency through mobility-aware clustering, energy-centric cluster head (CH) selection, and a ground station(GS)-assisted cluster maintenance management mechanism. First, steady multi-hop clusters are constructed, having CHs with not only high stability and high energy but also with steady and high-energy neighboring areas, and then a proper GS-assisted cluster maintenance mechanism is applied. Experimental results, based on extended simulations, demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing schemes significantly, in terms of cluster stability, communication overhead, and security resilience.

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: FlexiWalker是首个GPU框架，为动态随机游走提供高效、通用的支持，通过优化采样内核、轻量级成本模型和编译时组件，显著超越现有CPU/GPU方案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 动态随机游走的运行时依赖转移概率打破了传统预计算优化策略，导致现有框架性能不佳，开发者需要手动调优内核且无法适应工作负载多样性。

Method: 1) 设计拒绝采样和蓄水池采样的高性能内核，消除全局归约、冗余内存访问和随机数生成；2) 采用轻量级一阶成本模型在运行时为每个节点选择最佳采样策略；3) 引入编译时组件自动将用户定义的游走逻辑特化为优化构建块。

Result: 在真实图数据的各种动态随机游走工作负载上，FlexiWalker比最佳已发布的CPU/GPU基线分别提升几何平均73.44倍和5.91倍，并能执行先前系统无法支持的工作负载。

Conclusion: FlexiWalker成功解决了动态随机游走在GPU上的高效执行问题，通过系统化方法实现了性能显著提升和更好的通用性，已开源供社区使用。

Abstract: Dynamic random walks are fundamental to various graph analysis applications, offering advantages by adapting to evolving graph properties. Their runtime-dependent transition probabilities break down the pre-computation strategy that underpins most existing CPU and GPU static random walk optimizations. This leaves practitioners suffering from suboptimal frameworks and having to write hand-tuned kernels that do not adapt to workload diversity. To handle this issue, we present FlexiWalker, the first GPU framework that delivers efficient, workload-generic support for dynamic random walks. Our design-space study shows that rejection sampling and reservoir sampling are more suitable than other sampling techniques under massive parallelism. Thus, we devise (i) new high-performance kernels for them that eliminate global reductions, redundant memory accesses, and random-number generation. Given the necessity of choosing the best-fitting sampling strategy at runtime, we adopt (ii) a lightweight first-order cost model that selects the faster kernel per node at runtime. To enhance usability, we introduce (iii) a compile-time component that automatically specializes user-supplied walk logic into optimized building blocks. On various dynamic random walk workloads with real-world graphs, FlexiWalker outperforms the best published CPU/GPU baselines by geometric means of 73.44x and 5.91x, respectively, while successfully executing workloads that prior systems cannot support. We open-source FlexiWalker in https://github.com/AIS-SNU/FlexiWalker.

### [227] [SIMPLE: Disaggregating Sampling from GPU Inference into a Decision Plane for Faster Distributed LLM Serving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00719)
*Bohan Zhao,Zane Cao,Yongchao He*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: SIMPLE是一个解决LLM推理中采样瓶颈的系统，通过将采样卸载到CPU、序列并行采样和推测性热词采样等技术，显著提升吞吐量和降低延迟。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM使用张量并行和流水线并行扩展，数据平面（注意力/GEMM和KV缓存）得到优化，采样（决策平面）成为新瓶颈。采样既不随TP扩展，也不在PP阶段间平衡，导致其在迭代时间中的占比增加，限制了流水线频率。

Method: SIMPLE采用三部分技术：1) 序列并行采样，沿批次维度分片工作，消除词汇轴集体通信；2) CPU端算法，使用列式惩罚和截断优先过滤实现单次线性时间内核；3) 推测性热词采样(SHVS)，在小热词集上采样并拒绝校正，使用简单尺寸模型选择最大化吞吐量的热词集大小。

Result: SIMPLE将端到端吞吐量提升高达96%，P95延迟降低20-65%。系统无需用户端代码更改，可与现有数据平面优化组合，释放未来GPU代际的扩展效益。

Conclusion: SIMPLE通过将采样解耦为CPU端服务，解决了LLM推理中的采样瓶颈问题，使其恢复为次要、隐藏的角色，显著提升了大规模语言模型推理的性能和可扩展性。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) scale out with tensor parallelism (TP) and pipeline parallelism (PP) and production stacks have aggressively optimized the data plane (attention/GEMM and KV cache), sampling, the decision plane that turns logits into tokens, becomes a new bottleneck. This creates a structural holdout: sampling neither expands with TP nor balances across PP stages, so its share of iteration time grows as GPUs get faster and it caps pipeline frequency at the last stage. We present SIMPLE, a stage-agnostic, sequence-parallel, overlappable decision plane that disaggregates sampling into a CPU-side service and shrinks its runtime footprint back to a minor, hidden role. SIMPLE combines: (1) sequence-parallel sampling, which shards work along the batch dimension and removes vocabulary-axis collectives; (2) a CPU-based algorithm with column-wise penalties and truncation-first filtering to realize single-pass, linear-time kernels; and (3) speculative hot-vocab sampling (SHVS), which samples on a small hot set with rejection-correctness and uses a simple sizing model to choose the hot-vocab size that maximizes throughput. In evaluation, SIMPLE improves end-to-end throughput by up to 96% and reduces P95 latency by 20-65%. Crucially, SIMPLE requires no user-side code changes and composes with existing data-plane optimizations, unlocking scaling benefits that compound with future GPU generations.

TL;DR: SmartFed是一个资源高效的联邦微调框架，通过重用现有LoRA模块知识，引入MoRE（混合秩专家）和EEQA（弹性专家配额分配）来优化计算和通信资源，显著提升模型性能和训练效率。

Motivation: 联邦微调虽然能保护数据隐私，但其高计算和通信成本阻碍了在资源受限设备上的部署。需要一种资源高效的解决方案来适应下游任务。

Method: 1. 智能重用现有LoRA模块知识，避免从头训练；2. 引入MoRE（混合秩专家），将LoRA模块分解为细粒度秩级专家，根据输入语义和资源预算选择性激活组合；3. 提出EEQA（弹性专家配额分配），根据参数矩阵对性能的贡献自适应分配专家容量，聚焦计算资源于关键专家。

Result: 在多个基准测试上的广泛评估表明，SmartFed在模型性能和训练效率方面显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: SmartFed通过重用知识和资源优化，为资源受限环境下的联邦微调提供了高效解决方案，平衡了隐私保护、模型性能和资源效率。

Abstract: Federated fine-tuning offers a promising solution for adapting Large Language Models (LLMs) to downstream tasks while safeguarding data privacy. However, its high computational and communication demands hinder its deployment on resource-constrained devices. In this paper, we propose SmartFed, a resource-efficient federated fine-tuning framework. SmartFed intelligently reuses knowledge embedded in existing LoRA modules, eliminating the need for expensive training from scratch when adapting LLMs to new tasks. To effectively exploit this knowledge and ensure scalability, we introduce the Mixture of Rank-Wise Experts (MoRE). MoRE decomposes LoRA modules into fine-grained rank-level experts. These experts are selectively activated and combined based on input semantics and resource budgets. Moreover, to optimize resource utilization, we present the Elastic Expert Quota Allocation (EEQA). EEQA adaptively allocates expert capacity across parameter matrices based on their contribution to model performance, focusing computing resources on the critical experts. Extensive evaluations across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that SmartFed significantly outperforms existing methods in model performance and training efficiency.

Result: 提出了架构和算法组件，并在6G多接入边缘计算中展示了代表性用例。

Conclusion: 该框架能够适应异构边缘环境的波动性，通过动态编排实现高效、响应式的基础模型推理部署。

Abstract: Inference over large-scale foundation models within heterogeneous edge environments necessitates a fundamentally reconfigurable orchestration substrate. Static partitioning of model layers presumes temporal stability across compute and network resources, which is misaligned with the volatility of real-world deployments. We introduce a framework in which both the spatial placement and internal segmentation of foundation models are elevated to runtime-resolved constructs. The orchestration problem is formalized as a constrained optimization over layer-wise assignments, subject to evolving latency, utilization, and privacy gradients. The framework implements reactive inference composition responsive to infrastructural fluctuations by integrating model-aware capacity profiling with dynamic graph re-partitioning and reallocation. We introduce architectural and algorithmic components, along with a representative use case in 6G multi-access edge computing.

Conclusion: Tangram通过高效的GPU内存复用技术有效解决了Serverless LLM平台中的内存使用效率低下和冷启动问题。

Abstract: Serverless Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as a cost-effective solution for deploying AI services by enabling a 'pay-as-you-go' pricing model through GPU resource sharing. However, cold-start latency, especially the model loading phase, has become a critical performance bottleneck, as it scales linearly with model size and severely limits the practical deployment of large-scale LLM services. This paper presents Tangram, a novel system that accelerates Serverless LLM loading through efficient GPU memory reuse. By leveraging the unused GPU memory to retain model parameters, Tangram significantly reduces model transfer time and cold-start latency. Its design includes three key components: unified GPU memory pool for tensor-level parameter sharing across models, on-demand KV cache allocation for dynamic memory management, and GPU-affinity-aware scheduling for maximizing resource utilization. These techniques collectively address the critical challenges of inefficient memory usage and the cold-start problem in Serverless LLM platforms. We have implemented a fully functional prototype, and experiments show that Tangram achieves up to 6.2 times faster loading and reduces Time-To-First-Token (TTFT) during cold-start by 23--55% over state-of-the-art methods.

TL;DR: 本文提出Delta Sum Learning方法改进Gossip Learning中的聚合操作，并基于Open Application Model实现去中心化编排框架，在节点扩展时显著降低准确率损失。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦学习和Gossip学习通常使用的平均聚合方法对模型准确性和全局收敛性不理想，且缺乏基于声明式方法（如Kubernetes清单）在边缘部署学习工作负载的选项。

Method: 提出Delta Sum Learning方法改进Gossip Learning中的基本聚合操作，并在基于Open Application Model的去中心化编排框架中实现，支持动态节点发现和意图驱动的多工作负载应用部署。

Result: 在10节点拓扑中，Delta Sum性能与替代集成方法相当；在扩展到50节点时，全局准确率下降降低58%；在有限连接条件下，相比替代方法的线性损失，Delta Sum表现出对数级准确率损失和强全局收敛性。

Conclusion: Delta Sum Learning能有效改进去中心化学习的聚合效果，特别是在大规模节点拓扑中显著减少准确率损失，结合去中心化编排框架为边缘学习部署提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Federated Learning is a popular approach for distributed learning due to its security and computational benefits. With the advent of powerful devices in the network edge, Gossip Learning further decentralizes Federated Learning by removing centralized integration and relying fully on peer to peer updates. However, the averaging methods generally used in both Federated and Gossip Learning are not ideal for model accuracy and global convergence. Additionally, there are few options to deploy Learning workloads in the edge as part of a larger application using a declarative approach such as Kubernetes manifests. This paper proposes Delta Sum Learning as a method to improve the basic aggregation operation in Gossip Learning, and implements it in a decentralized orchestration framework based on Open Application Model, which allows for dynamic node discovery and intent-driven deployment of multi-workload applications. Evaluation results show that Delta Sum performance is on par with alternative integration methods for 10 node topologies, but results in a 58% lower global accuracy drop when scaling to 50 nodes. Overall, it shows strong global convergence and a logarithmic loss of accuracy with increasing topology size compared to a linear loss for alternatives under limited connectivity.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界中的关系数据通常以图结构表示，但随着图规模增大，不规则访问模式、NUMA和物理内存限制使得传统共享内存框架难以扩展，需要分布式内存解决方案。

Method: 开发分析转换框架，识别节点邻居访问模式并进行重排序以聚合通信；利用机会性缓存避免通信；基于Open MPI的被动RMA构建优化的大规模归约底层。

Result: 在多个大数据图上测试单源最短路径算法，性能优于d-Galois 2.05倍，优于DRONE 1.44倍。

Conclusion: StarPlat的MPI后端通过通信优化技术有效解决了分布式图算法的扩展性问题，为大规模图计算提供了高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Relational data, occurring in the real world, are often structured as graphs, which provide the logical abstraction required to make analytical derivations simpler. As graphs get larger, the irregular access patterns exhibited in most graph algorithms, hamper performance. This, along with NUMA and physical memory limits, results in scaling complexities with sequential/shared memory frameworks. StarPlat's MPI backend abstracts away the programmatic complexity involved in designing optimal distributed graph algorithms. It provides an instrument for coding graph algorithms that scale over distributed memory. In this work, we provide an analysis-transformation framework that leverages general semantics associated with iterations involving nodes and their neighbors, within StarPlat, to aggregate communication. The framework scans for patterns that warrant re-ordering in neighborhood access patterns, aggregate communication, and avoid communication altogether with opportunistic caching in reduction constructs. We also architect an optimized bulk-reduction substrate using Open MPI's passive Remote Memory Access (RMA) constructs. We applied our optimization logic to StarPlat's distributed backend and outperformed d-Galois by 2.05 and DRONE by 1.44 times in Single Source Shortest Paths across several big data graphs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MPI应用性能分析中，轨迹文件越来越大，通信行为复杂，全面可视化检查变得不切实际。现有工具提供的全局聚合指标可能掩盖瞬态性能瓶颈

Method: 将执行轨迹离散化为固定或自适应时间窗口，处理后验Paraver轨迹，重建关键执行路径，处理时钟不一致和未匹配MPI事件等常见异常，为每个窗口计算标准MPI性能指标（负载均衡、序列化、传输效率）

Result: 在合成基准测试和实际应用（LaMEM和ls1-MarDyn）中验证，时间分辨指标能揭示被全局聚合掩盖的局部性能瓶颈，提供轻量级、可扩展的替代方案

Conclusion: 时间分辨的MPI性能指标计算方法能有效暴露瞬态性能瓶颈，即使轨迹可视化不切实际时也能提供有价值的性能洞察

Abstract: Detailed trace analysis of MPI applications is essential for performance engineering, but growing trace sizes and complex communication behaviour often render comprehensive visual inspection impractical. This work presents a trace-based calculation of time-resolved values of standard MPI performance metrics, load balance, serialisation, and transfer efficiency, by discretising execution traces into fixed or adaptive time segments. The implementation processes Paraver traces postmortem, reconstructing critical execution paths and handling common event anomalies, such as clock inconsistencies and unmatched MPI events, to robustly calculate metrics for each segment. The calculated per-window metric values expose transient performance bottlenecks that the timeaggregated metrics from existing tools may conceal. Evaluations on a synthetic benchmark and real-world applications (LaMEM and ls1-MarDyn) demonstrate how time-resolved metrics reveal localised performance bottlenecks obscured by global aggregates, offering a lightweight and scalable alternative even when trace visualisation is impractical.
