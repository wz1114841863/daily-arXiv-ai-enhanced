This work proposes a novel framework\nthat uses large language models (LLMs) to perform poisoning detection and\nsanitization in HAR systems, utilizing zero-shot, one-shot, and few-shot\nlearning paradigms. Our approach incorporates \\textit{role play} prompting,\nwhereby the LLM assumes the role of expert to contextualize and evaluate sensor\nanomalies, and \\textit{think step-by-step} reasoning, guiding the LLM to infer\npoisoning indicators in the raw sensor data and plausible clean alternatives.\nThese strategies minimize reliance on curation of extensive datasets and enable\nrobust, adaptable defense mechanisms in real-time.

Q-learning\nalgorithms struggle particularly with the curse of dimensionality, where the\nnumber of state-action pairs grows exponentially with problem size. While\nneural network-based approaches like Deep Q-Networks have shown success, recent\ntensor-based methods using low-rank decomposition offer more\nparameter-efficient alternatives. Building upon existing tensor-based methods,\nwe propose Tensor-Efficient Q-Learning (TEQL), which enhances low-rank tensor\ndecomposition via improved block coordinate descent on discretized state-action\nspaces, incorporating novel exploration and regularization mechanisms. The key\ninnovation is an exploration strategy that combines approximation error with\nvisit count-based upper confidence bound to prioritize actions with high\nuncertainty, avoiding wasteful random exploration. Additionally, we incorporate\na frequency-based penalty term in the objective function to encourage\nexploration of less-visited state-action pairs and reduce overfitting to\nfrequently visited regions. Empirical results on classic control tasks\ndemonstrate that TEQL outperforms conventional matrix-based methods and deep RL\napproaches in both sample efficiency and total rewards, making it suitable for\nresource-constrained applications, such as space and healthcare where sampling\ncosts are high."}

These requirements\nseverely limit practical applicability, as many real-world scenarios provide\nonly state observations without corresponding actions and expert performance is\noften suboptimal. In this paper we introduce a deep implicit imitation\nreinforcement learning framework that addresses both limitations by combining\ndeep reinforcement learning with implicit imitation learning from\nobservation-only datasets. Our main algorithm, Deep Implicit Imitation\nQ-Network (DIIQN), employs an action inference mechanism that reconstructs\nexpert actions through online exploration and integrates a dynamic confidence\nmechanism that adaptively balances expert-guided and self-directed learning.\nThis enables the agent to leverage expert guidance for accelerated training\nwhile maintaining capacity to surpass suboptimal expert performance. We further\nextend our framework with a Heterogeneous Actions DIIQN (HA-DIIQN) algorithm to\ntackle scenarios where expert and agent possess different action sets, a\nchallenge previously unaddressed in the implicit imitation learning literature.\nHA-DIIQN introduces an infeasibility detection mechanism and a bridging\nprocedure identifying alternative pathways connecting agent capabilities to\nexpert guidance when direct action replication is impossible. Our experimental\nresults demonstrate that DIIQN achieves up to 130% higher episodic returns\ncompared to standard DQN, while consistently outperforming existing implicit\nimitation methods that cannot exceed expert performance. In heterogeneous\naction settings, HA-DIIQN learns up to 64% faster than baselines, leveraging\nexpert datasets unusable by conventional approaches. Extensive parameter\nsensitivity analysis reveals the framework's robustness across varying dataset\nsizes and hyperparameter configurations."}
