### [1] [Rethinking Inference Placement for Deep Learning across Edge and Cloud Platforms: A Multi-Objective Optimization Perspective and Future Directions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22909)
*Zongshun Zhang,Ibrahim Matta*

Main category: cs.DC

Abstract: Edge intelligent applications like VR/AR and language model based chatbots
have become widespread with the rapid expansion of IoT and mobile devices.
However, constrained edge devices often cannot serve the increasingly large and
complex deep learning (DL) models. To mitigate these challenges, researchers
have proposed optimizing and offloading partitions of DL models among user
devices, edge servers, and the cloud. In this setting, users can take advantage
of different services to support their intelligent applications. For example,
edge resources offer low response latency. In contrast, cloud platforms provide
low monetary cost computation resources for computation-intensive workloads.
However, communication between DL model partitions can introduce transmission
bottlenecks and pose risks of data leakage. Recent research aims to balance
accuracy, computation delay, transmission delay, and privacy concerns. They
address these issues with model compression, model distillation, transmission
compression, and model architecture adaptations, including internal
classifiers. This survey contextualizes the state-of-the-art model offloading
methods and model adaptation techniques by studying their implication to a
multi-objective optimization comprising inference latency, data privacy, and
resource monetary cost.

### [2] [When Agents are Powerful: Black Hole Search in Time-Varying Graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22309)
*Tanvir Kaur,Ashish Saxena*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: 本文改进了黑洞搜索问题中的代理能力，通过全局通信和1跳可见性来减少所需代理数量，在动态图中实现更高效的黑洞识别。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统黑洞搜索问题在动态图中需要大量代理，且受限于面对面通信的限制。本文旨在通过增强代理能力来减少所需代理数量并提高效率。

Method: 赋予代理全局通信能力（无论位置如何都能交互）和1跳可见性（能观察直接邻居），在动态图中进行黑洞搜索。

Result: 这些能力增强显著减少了解决黑洞搜索问题所需的代理数量，在动态图中实现了更高效的解决方案。

Conclusion: 全局通信和1跳可见性显著提升了黑洞搜索问题的效率，减少了所需代理数量，为动态图中的有害节点识别提供了更实用的解决方案。

Abstract: A black hole is a harmful node in a graph that destroys any resource entering
it, making its identification a critical task. In the \emph{Black Hole Search
(BHS)} problem, a team of agents operates on a graph $G$ with the objective
that at least one agent must survive and correctly identify an edge incident to
the black hole. Prior work has addressed BHS in arbitrary dynamic graphs under
the restrictive \emph{face-to-face} communication, where agents can exchange
information only when co-located. This constraint significantly increases the
number of agents required to solve the problem. In this work, we strengthen the
capabilities of agents in two ways: (i) granting them \emph{global
communication}, enabling interaction regardless of location, and (ii) equipping
them with \emph{1-hop visibility}, allowing each agent to observe its immediate
neighborhood. These enhancements lead to more efficient solutions for the BHS
problem in dynamic graphs.

### [3] [Separation of Unconscious Robots with Obstructed Visibility](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22434)
*Prajyot Pyati,Navjot Kaur,Saswata Jana,Adri Bhattacharya,Partha Sarathi Mandal*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: 本文研究了一种无意识移动机器人模型，在遮挡可见性条件下解决分离问题，将机器人分离成同心半圆，提出了在O(n)时间内无碰撞的算法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究假设机器人是透明的，能知道所有其他机器人的位置和颜色。本文考虑更现实的遮挡可见性模型，即机器人可能阻挡其他机器人之间的视线。

Method: 在Look-Compute-Move周期下，使用半同步调度器，机器人同意一个坐标轴但不知道n的数量，通过算法将机器人分离成同心半圆。

Result: 提出的算法在O(n)时间内解决了分离问题，且保证无碰撞。

Conclusion: 在遮挡可见性条件下，无意识机器人模型能够有效解决分离问题，形成同心半圆几何形状。

Abstract: We study a recently introduced \textit{unconscious} mobile robot model, where
each robot is associated with a \textit{color}, which is visible to other
robots but not to itself. The robots are autonomous, anonymous, oblivious and
silent, operating in the Euclidean plane under the conventional
\textit{Look-Compute-Move} cycle. A primary task in this model is the
\textit{separation problem}, where unconscious robots sharing the same color
must separate from others, forming recognizable geometric shapes such as
circles, points, or lines. All prior works model the robots as
\textit{transparent}, enabling each to know the positions and colors of all
other robots. In contrast, we model the robots as \textit{opaque}, where a
robot can obstruct the visibility of two other robots, if it lies on the line
segment between them. Under this obstructed visibility, we consider a variant
of the separation problem in which robots, starting from any arbitrary initial
configuration, are required to separate into concentric semicircles. We present
a collision-free algorithm that solves the separation problem under a
semi-synchronous scheduler in $O(n)$ epochs, where $n$ is the number of robots.
The robots agree on one coordinate axis but have no knowledge of $n$.

### [4] [Bayes-Split-Edge: Bayesian Optimization for Constrained Collaborative Inference in Wireless Edge Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23503)
*Fatemeh Zahra Safaeipour,Jacob Chakareski,Morteza Hashemi*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: 提出Bayes-Split-Edge框架，使用贝叶斯优化联合优化传输功率和神经网络分割点，实现无线边缘网络中的协作推理，在能量和延迟约束下最大化推理性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 移动边缘设备（如AR/VR头显）通常需要在有限的计算和能源资源下完成及时推理任务，需要优化推理性能同时满足能量和延迟约束。

Method: 提出Bayes-Split-Edge解决方案，利用贝叶斯优化进行无线边缘网络中的协作分割推理，联合优化传输功率和神经网络分割点，采用混合采集函数平衡推理任务效用、样本效率和约束违规惩罚。

Result: 在VGG19和Resnet101模型上的实验表明，Bayes-Split-Edge相比标准贝叶斯优化减少2.4倍评估成本，实现近似线性收敛，优于CMA-ES、DIRECT、穷举搜索和PPO等基线方法，在严格约束下匹配穷举搜索性能。

Conclusion: 该框架为边缘计算系统中的无线分割推理提供了样本高效的解决方案，最多需要20次函数评估，并能进行约束感知优化。

Abstract: Mobile edge devices (e.g., AR/VR headsets) typically need to complete timely
inference tasks while operating with limited on-board computing and energy
resources. In this paper, we investigate the problem of collaborative inference
in wireless edge networks, where energy-constrained edge devices aim to
complete inference tasks within given deadlines. These tasks are carried out
using neural networks, and the edge device seeks to optimize inference
performance under energy and delay constraints. The inference process can be
split between the edge device and an edge server, thereby achieving
collaborative inference over wireless networks. We formulate an inference
utility optimization problem subject to energy and delay constraints, and
propose a novel solution called Bayes-Split-Edge, which leverages Bayesian
optimization for collaborative split inference over wireless edge networks. Our
solution jointly optimizes the transmission power and the neural network split
point. The Bayes-Split-Edge framework incorporates a novel hybrid acquisition
function that balances inference task utility, sample efficiency, and
constraint violation penalties. We evaluate our approach using the VGG19 model
on the ImageNet-Mini dataset, and Resnet101 on Tiny-ImageNet, and real-world
mMobile wireless channel datasets. Numerical results demonstrate that
Bayes-Split-Edge achieves up to 2.4x reduction in evaluation cost compared to
standard Bayesian optimization and achieves near-linear convergence. It also
outperforms several baselines, including CMA-ES, DIRECT, exhaustive search, and
Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), while matching exhaustive search
performance under tight constraints. These results confirm that the proposed
framework provides a sample-efficient solution requiring maximum 20 function
evaluations and constraint-aware optimization for wireless split inference in
edge computing systems.

### [5] [Simopt-Power: Leveraging Simulation Metadata for Low-Power Design Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21745)
*Eashan Wadhwa,Shanker Shreejith*

Main category: cs.AR

TL;DR: Simopt-power是一个基于仿真分析的FPGA低功耗优化框架，通过识别高切换路径并选择性重新配置，实现约9%的动态功耗降低，仅增加约9%的LUT资源。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代FPGA中过度切换活动是动态功耗的主要来源，传统低功耗技术需要侵入性设计变更或随着器件密度增长而收益递减。

Method: 利用仿真分析识别高切换路径，通过Shannon分解原理插入重复真值表逻辑并重新定位关键网络，在不影响功能行为的情况下减少不必要切换。

Result: 在开源RTLLM基准测试中，平均实现约9%的切换诱导功耗降低，算术设计仅增加约9%的LUT等效资源。

Conclusion: 将仿真洞察与针对性优化相结合可以有效降低动态功耗，为在FPGA-CAD流程中使用仿真元数据提供了实用路径。

Abstract: Excessive switching activity is a primary contributor to dynamic power
dissipation in modern FPGAs, where fine-grained configurability amplifies
signal toggling and associated capacitance. Conventional low-power techniques
-- gating, clock-domain partitioning, and placement-aware netlist rewrites -
either require intrusive design changes or offer diminishing returns as device
densities grow. In this work, we present Simopt-power, a simulator-driven
optimisation framework that leverages simulation analysis to identify and
selectively reconfigure high-toggle paths. By feeding activity profiles back
into a lightweight transformation pass, Simopt-power judiciously inserts
duplicate truth table logic using Shannon Decomposition principle and relocates
critical nets, thereby attenuating unnecessary transitions without perturbing
functional behaviour. We evaluated this framework on open-source RTLLM
benchmark, with Simopt-power achieves an average switching-induced power
reduction of ~9\% while incurring only ~9\% additional LUT-equivalent resources
for arithmetic designs. These results demonstrate that coupling simulation
insights with targeted optimisations can yield a reduced dynamic power,
offering a practical path toward using simulation metadata in the FPGA-CAD
flow.

Main category: cs.AR

TL;DR: QuArch是首个专门评估大语言模型在计算机架构领域知识和推理能力的基准测试，包含2,671个专家验证的问题-答案对，覆盖处理器设计、内存系统等核心主题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大语言模型评估缺乏计算机架构领域的专门测试，该领域连接高层软件抽象和底层硬件实现，对计算系统创新至关重要。

Method: 开发包含2,671个专家验证QA对的综合基准，涵盖处理器设计、内存系统、互连网络等计算机架构核心领域，评估模型在分析、设计和实现方面的能力。

Result: 前沿模型在领域知识方面表现良好，但在需要高阶思维的计算机架构问题上表现不佳，准确率从34%到72%不等，显示在架构推理方面存在显著差距。

Conclusion: QuArch为构建和衡量大语言模型在计算机架构领域的能力提供了基础，有助于加速计算系统创新，代表了社区在LLM评估中设定架构推理标准的努力。

Abstract: The field of computer architecture, which bridges high-level software
abstractions and low-level hardware implementations, remains absent from
current large language model (LLM) evaluations. To this end, we present QuArch
(pronounced 'quark'), the first benchmark designed to facilitate the
development and evaluation of LLM knowledge and reasoning capabilities
specifically in computer architecture. QuArch provides a comprehensive
collection of 2,671 expert-validated question-answer (QA) pairs covering
various aspects of computer architecture, including processor design, memory
systems, and interconnection networks. Our evaluation reveals that while
frontier models possess domain-specific knowledge, they struggle with skills
that require higher-order thinking in computer architecture. Frontier model
accuracies vary widely (from 34% to 72%) on these advanced questions,
highlighting persistent gaps in architectural reasoning across analysis,
design, and implementation QAs. By holistically assessing fundamental skills,
QuArch provides a foundation for building and measuring LLM capabilities that
can accelerate innovation in computing systems. With over 140 contributors from
40 institutions, this benchmark represents a community effort to set the
standard for architectural reasoning in LLM evaluation.

### [7] [RAMAN: Resource-efficient ApproxiMate Posit Processing for Algorithm-Hardware Co-desigN](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22627)
*Mohd Faisal Khan,Mukul Lokhande,Santosh Kumar Vishvakarma*

Main category: cs.AR

TL;DR: 提出了RAMAN，一种基于近似posit(8,2)的MAC架构，通过硬件近似实现资源效率提升，适用于边缘AI应用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 边缘AI应用在资源受限环境中面临计算效率挑战，需要平衡硬件效率和精度。

Method: 使用REAP MAC引擎进行近似乘法累加，结合可扩展向量执行单元和算法-硬件协同设计框架。

Result: 在FPGA和ASIC平台上实现46% LUT节省、35.66%面积减少、31.28%功耗降低，手写数字识别准确率达98.45%。

Conclusion: RAMAN在硬件效率和学习性能之间实现了良好平衡，适合下一代边缘智能应用。

Abstract: Edge-AI applications still face considerable challenges in enhancing
computational efficiency in resource-constrained environments. This work
presents RAMAN, a resource-efficient and approximate posit(8,2)-based
Multiply-Accumulate (MAC) architecture designed to improve hardware efficiency
within bandwidth limitations. The proposed REAP (Resource-Efficient Approximate
Posit) MAC engine, which is at the core of RAMAN, uses approximation in the
posit multiplier to achieve significant area and power reductions with an
impact on accuracy. To support diverse AI workloads, this MAC unit is
incorporated in a scalable Vector Execution Unit (VEU), which permits hardware
reuse and parallelism among deep neural network layers. Furthermore, we propose
an algorithm-hardware co-design framework incorporating approximation-aware
training to evaluate the impact of hardware-level approximation on
application-level performance. Empirical validation on FPGA and ASIC platforms
shows that the proposed REAP MAC achieves up to 46% in LUT savings and 35.66%
area, 31.28% power reduction, respectively, over the baseline Posit Dot-Product
Unit (PDPU) design, while maintaining high accuracy (98.45%) for handwritten
digit recognition. RAMAN demonstrates a promising trade-off between hardware
efficiency and learning performance, making it suitable for next-generation
edge intelligence.

### [8] [Approximate Signed Multiplier with Sign-Focused Compressor for Edge Detection Applications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22674)
*L. Hemanth Krishna,Srinivasu Bodapati,Sreehari Veeramachaneni,BhaskaraRao Jammu,Noor Mahammad Sk*

Main category: cs.AR

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于边缘检测的近似有符号乘法器架构，采用符号聚焦压缩器设计，在保持性能的同时显著降低功耗和延迟。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对机器学习和信号处理中的边缘检测应用，需要高效处理有符号乘法运算，特别是处理常数"1"和负部分积等常见情况。

Method: 使用两种符号聚焦压缩器(A+B+C+1和A+B+C+D+1)，结合精确和近似压缩器设计，对部分积矩阵的下N-1列进行截断并采用误差补偿机制。

Result: 8位近似乘法器相比现有最佳乘法器，功率延迟积降低29.21%，功耗降低14.39%，在卷积层中成功实现边缘检测功能。

Conclusion: 该近似有符号乘法器架构在边缘检测应用中具有实际应用价值，在保持功能性的同时显著提升了能效。

Abstract: This paper presents an approximate signed multiplier architecture that
incorporates a sign-focused compressor, specifically designed for edge
detection applications in machine learning and signal processing. The
multiplier incorporates two types of sign-focused compressors: A + B + C + 1
and A + B + C + D + 1. Both exact and approximate compressor designs are
utilized, with a focus on efficiently handling constant value "1" and negative
partial products, which frequently appear in the partial product matrices of
signed multipliers. To further enhance efficiency, the lower N - 1 columns of
the partial product matrix are truncated, followed by an error compensation
mechanism. Experimental results show that the proposed 8-bit approximate
multiplier achieves a 29.21% reduction in power delay product (PDP) and a
14.39% reduction in power compared to the best of existing multipliers. The
proposed multiplier is integrated into a custom convolution layer and performs
edge detection, demonstrating its practical utility in real-world applications.

### [9] [A Feature Engineering Approach for Business Impact-Oriented Failure Detection in Distributed Instant Payment Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21710)
*Lorenzo Porcelli*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出一种基于ISO 20022消息处理时间的特征工程方法，用于即时支付系统的异常检测和故障定位，在TIPS系统中验证了有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统监控方法无法弥合技术基础设施指标与业务流程可见性之间的差距，即时支付系统需要处理数百万交易且要求零停机。

Method: 基于连续ISO 20022消息交换的处理时间构建特征工程，创建系统状态的紧凑表示，并应用异常检测技术。

Result: 在TARGET即时支付结算系统上的实验评估显示，该方法能有效检测多种异常模式，提供可解释的解释，显著减少调查时间。

Conclusion: 该方法通过将特征映射到不同的处理阶段，区分内部和外部支付系统问题，弥合分布式系统中交易状态碎片化的可观测性差距。

Abstract: Instant payment infrastructures have stringent performance requirements,
processing millions of transactions daily with zero-downtime expectations.
Traditional monitoring approaches fail to bridge the gap between technical
infrastructure metrics and business process visibility. We introduce a novel
feature engineering approach based on processing times computed between
consecutive ISO 20022 message exchanges, creating a compact representation of
system state. By applying anomaly detection to these features, we enable early
failure detection and localization, allowing incident classification.
Experimental evaluation on the TARGET Instant Payment Settlement (TIPS) system,
using both real-world incidents and controlled simulations, demonstrates the
approach's effectiveness in detecting diverse anomaly patterns and provides
inherently interpretable explanations that enable operators to understand the
business impact. By mapping features to distinct processing phases, the
resulting framework differentiates between internal and external payment system
issues, significantly reduces investigation time, and bridges observability
gaps in distributed systems where transaction state is fragmented across
multiple entities.

### [10] [Numerical Fragility in Transformers: A Layer-wise Theory for Explaining, Forecasting, and Mitigating Instability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21770)
*Jinwoo Baek*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一个一阶模块化理论，用于预测Transformer在低精度训练中的前向误差放大问题，并提供了可解释的诊断指标来识别和缓解不稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 低精度训练的Transformer会遭受前向误差放大问题，需要理论框架来预测和理解误差增长机制。

Method: 推导了自注意力层的误差边界，包含三个可解释的诊断指标：分数尺度比、行式softmax敏感度和值条件数；证明了残差块的误差衰减特性；引入了精度和宽度感知的LayerNorm指标。

Result: 在Tiny-ViT/CIFAR-10上的实验表明，组合预测器能准确跟踪不同精度间的误差失配，κ_softmax可作为早期预警信号，基于ρ_LN的微小调整能有效稳定训练。

Conclusion: 该理论提供了可操作的诊断指标，能够解释自注意力的脆弱性、预测不稳定性，并指导最小侵入性的缓解措施。

Abstract: Transformers trained in low precision can suffer forward-error amplification.
We give a first-order, module-wise theory that predicts when and where errors
grow. For self-attention we derive a per-layer bound that factorizes into three
interpretable diagnostics: a score-scale ratio $\kappa_{\rm score}$, a rowwise
softmax sensitivity $\kappa_{\rm softmax}$, and value conditioning $\kappa(V)$.
We prove a residual relaxation inequality showing that residual blocks
attenuate depth-wise accumulation, and we introduce a precision- and
width-aware LayerNorm indicator $\rho_{\rm LN}$ with a matching first-order
bound in the $\epsilon$-dominated regime. These pieces yield a unified
forward-stability bound whose right-hand side is directly estimable during
training.
  On Tiny-ViT/CIFAR-10 we evaluate the bound and components. (1) The combined
predictor $\kappa_{\rm softmax},(1+\kappa_{\rm
score}),\kappa(V),|W_O|2+\kappa{\rm eff}+C_{\rm LN}$ tracks
FP32$\leftrightarrow$LP mismatches across seeds, widths, and precisions;
scaling by $\epsilon_{\rm mach}$ collapses mixed-precision points. (2) The
time-series maximum of $\kappa_{\rm softmax}$ acts as an early-warning signal,
leading error spikes by 16-24 steps (corr. 0.65-0.82; permutation
$p!\approx!10^{-3}$; Precision@K 0.89-1.00). (3) Guided by $\rho_{\rm LN}$, a
small LayerNorm-$\epsilon$ tweak targeting $\rho_\star$ gives consistent
stabilization (mean tail-loss $\downarrow\ \approx0.010$ at $\rho_\star!=!0.6$,
cap$=10^{-2}$) with negligible overhead.
  Overall, our theory supplies actionable, unitless diagnostics that (i)
explain when self-attention is fragile, (ii) forecast instability, and (iii)
motivate a minimally invasive mitigation.

*Jinwoo Baek*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出Chebyshev Moment Regularization (CMR)方法，通过直接优化层谱来改善神经网络训练条件，显著降低条件数并提升测试精度


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决深度神经网络训练中的病态问题，通过直接控制层谱来改善优化稳定性

Method: 使用Chebyshev矩正则化，联合控制谱边界和内部形状，采用解耦的混合规则保持任务梯度

Result: 在MNIST 15层MLP上，条件数从约3900降至约3.4，测试精度从10%提升至86%

Conclusion: 支持优化驱动的谱预处理方法，直接引导模型进入良好条件状态以实现稳定准确的学习

Abstract: We introduce \textbf{Chebyshev Moment Regularization (CMR)}, a simple,
architecture-agnostic loss that directly optimizes layer spectra. CMR jointly
controls spectral edges via a log-condition proxy and shapes the interior via
Chebyshev moments, with a decoupled, capped mixing rule that preserves task
gradients. We prove strictly monotone descent for the condition proxy, bounded
moment gradients, and orthogonal invariance. In an adversarial
``$\kappa$-stress'' setting (MNIST, 15-layer MLP), \emph{compared to vanilla
training}, CMR reduces mean layer condition numbers by $\sim\!10^3$ (from
$\approx3.9\!\times\!10^3$ to $\approx3.4$ in 5 epochs), increases average
gradient magnitude, and restores test accuracy (
$\approx10\%\!\to\!\approx86\%$ ). These results support
\textbf{optimization-driven spectral preconditioning}: directly steering models
toward well-conditioned regimes for stable, accurate learning.

*Supriya Nagesh,Karina Covarrubias,Robert El-Kareh,Shiva Prasad Kasiviswanathan,Nina Mishra*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 开发机器学习模型预测术后误吸风险，XGBoost模型表现最佳（AUROC 0.86），发现阿片类药物剂量、手术部位和性别差异是关键影响因素。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 误吸严重影响手术患者发病率和死亡率，需要开发预测模型以实现及时预防干预。

Method: 从MIMIC-IV数据库中识别826例术后误吸患者，使用XGBoost、多层感知机和随机森林三种机器学习模型，结合平均处理效应分析因果关系。

Result: 模型在测试集上AUROC达0.86，敏感性77.3%。最大日阿片类药物剂量、住院时间和患者年龄是最重要预测因子。男性误吸风险是女性的1.5倍，且阿片类药物剂量高出27%。

Conclusion: 机器学习模型能有效预测术后误吸风险，阿片类药物剂量和手术部位显著影响风险，性别差异需要进一步研究以改进术后护理方案。

Abstract: Background: Aspiration, the inhalation of foreign material into the lungs,
significantly impacts surgical patient morbidity and mortality. This study
develops a machine learning (ML) model to predict postoperative aspiration,
enabling timely preventative interventions.
  Methods: From the MIMIC-IV database of over 400,000 hospital admissions, we
identified 826 surgical patients (mean age: 62, 55.7\% male) who experienced
aspiration within seven days post-surgery, along with a matched non-aspiration
cohort. Three ML models: XGBoost, Multilayer Perceptron, and Random Forest were
trained using pre-surgical hospitalization data to predict postoperative
aspiration. To investigate causation, we estimated Average Treatment Effects
(ATE) using Augmented Inverse Probability Weighting.
  Results: Our ML model achieved an AUROC of 0.86 and 77.3\% sensitivity on a
held-out test set. Maximum daily opioid dose, length of stay, and patient age
emerged as the most important predictors. ATE analysis identified significant
causative factors: opioids (0.25 +/- 0.06) and operative site (neck: 0.20 +/-
0.13, head: 0.19 +/- 0.13). Despite equal surgery rates across genders, men
were 1.5 times more likely to aspirate and received 27\% higher maximum daily
opioid dosages compared to women.
  Conclusion: ML models can effectively predict postoperative aspiration risk,
enabling targeted preventative measures. Maximum daily opioid dosage and
operative site significantly influence aspiration risk. The gender disparity in
both opioid administration and aspiration rates warrants further investigation.
These findings have important implications for improving postoperative care
protocols and aspiration prevention strategies.

### [13] [Online Mixture of Experts: No-Regret Learning for Optimal Collective Decision-Making](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21788)
*Larkin Liu,Jalal Etesami*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了两种在线专家混合算法，通过专家指导的bandit学习来优化专家委员会的聚合输出，并在大语言模型微调中应用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在给定上下文的情况下，需要找到最优的专家委员会聚合策略，以提高整体预测准确率。

Method: 第一种算法结合聚合投票和UCB驱动的连续消除；第二种算法使用在线加权多数投票机制，根据专家的预测能力分配投票权重。

Result: 在理想情况下获得了理论上的遗憾保证，并提供了相应的实证结果。

Conclusion: 这些方法为结合多个专家提升整体模型性能提供了新的方法论和无遗憾保证。

Abstract: We explore the use of expert-guided bandit learning, which we refer to as
online mixture-of-experts (OMoE). In this setting, given a context, a candidate
committee of experts must determine how to aggregate their outputs to achieve
optimal results in terms of aggregate accuracy. We propose two algorithms to
address this problem. The first algorithm combines aggregate voting with
UCB-driven successive elimination, efficiently pruning suboptimal exploration
actions. The second algorithm employs an online weighted-majority-voting
mechanism, leveraging the respective voting power of each expert proportional
to their predictive power. We derive theoretical guarantees for the regret
properties in the bandit setting under ideal circumstances, and empirical
results are provided accordingly. As a modern study on applications, these
methods are applied to the online fine-tuning of a set of expert large language
models (LLMs), where after each response, the generative LLM dynamically
reweighs its set of experts and/or selects the optimal committee of experts to
generate the most accurate response. Our results introduce new methodologies
and no-regret guarantees for combining multiple experts to improve on the
performance of the an aggregate model overall.

Result: 实验结果表明，掩模引导优化和超参数优化的问题表述比序列对问题表述表现更优，而进化算法在高维搜索空间中整体表现优于模拟退火和贝叶斯优化，并且相比主流芯片布局方法实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: BBOPlace-Bench不仅促进了芯片布局的高效BBO驱动解决方案的开发，还为BBO社区拓宽了实际应用场景。

Abstract: Chip placement is a vital stage in modern chip design as it has a substantial
impact on the subsequent processes and the overall quality of the final chip.
The use of black-box optimization (BBO) for chip placement has a history of
several decades. However, early efforts were limited by immature problem
formulations and inefficient algorithm designs. Recent progress has shown the
effectiveness and efficiency of BBO for chip placement, proving its potential
to achieve state-of-the-art results. Despite these advancements, the field
lacks a unified, BBO-specific benchmark for thoroughly assessing various
problem formulations and BBO algorithms. To fill this gap, we propose
BBOPlace-Bench, the first benchmark designed specifically for evaluating and
developing BBO algorithms for chip placement tasks. It integrates three problem
formulations of BBO for chip placement, and offers a modular, decoupled, and
flexible framework that enables users to seamlessly implement, test, and
compare their own algorithms. BBOPlace-Bench integrates a wide variety of
existing BBO algorithms, including simulated annealing (SA), evolutionary
algorithms (EAs), and Bayesian optimization (BO). Experimental results show
that the problem formulations of mask-guided optimization and hyperparameter
optimization exhibit superior performance than the sequence pair problem
formulation, while EAs demonstrate better overall performance than SA and BO,
especially in high-dimensional search spaces, and also achieve state-of-the-art
performance compared to the mainstream chip placement methods. BBOPlace-Bench
not only facilitates the development of efficient BBO-driven solutions for chip
placement but also broadens the practical application scenarios (which are
urgently needed) for the BBO community. The code of BBOPlace-Bench is available
at https://github.com/lamda-bbo/BBOPlace-Bench.

TL;DR: 提出方差减少引导(VRG)方法，通过统计测量预测误差并搜索新的采样轨迹来提升扩散模型生成质量，无需模型微调或修改。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型在采样过程中存在预测误差累积问题，导致生成质量下降，需要一种无需模型修改的误差缓解方法。

Method: 统计测量预测误差，提出VRG方法搜索具有相同步数但质量更高的采样轨迹，适用于条件和非条件生成。

Result: 在多个数据集和基线模型上的实验表明，VRG能显著提升扩散模型的生成质量。

Conclusion: VRG是一种有效的预测误差缓解技术，能提高扩散模型性能且易于实现。

Abstract: Diffusion models have become emerging generative models. Their sampling
process involves multiple steps, and in each step the models predict the noise
from a noisy sample. When the models make prediction, the output deviates from
the ground truth, and we call such a deviation as \textit{prediction error}.
The prediction error accumulates over the sampling process and deteriorates
generation quality. This paper introduces a novel technique for statistically
measuring the prediction error and proposes the Variance-Reduction Guidance
(VRG) method to mitigate this error. VRG does not require model fine-tuning or
modification. Given a predefined sampling trajectory, it searches for a new
trajectory which has the same number of sampling steps but produces higher
quality results. VRG is applicable to both conditional and unconditional
generation. Experiments on various datasets and baselines demonstrate that VRG
can significantly improve the generation quality of diffusion models. Source

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为"独裁者客户端"的新型恶意参与者，能够在联邦学习中完全消除其他客户端的贡献，同时保留自己的贡献。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦学习的去中心化特性引入了安全漏洞，恶意客户端可能破坏或操纵训练过程。

Method: 提出了具体的攻击策略，并在多独裁者客户端场景下进行理论分析，包括协作、独立行动和背叛等情况。

Result: 通过计算机视觉和自然语言处理基准测试的实证评估支持了理论发现。

Conclusion: 独裁者客户端是一类定义明确且可分析的新型恶意参与者，对联邦学习构成严重威胁。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) has emerged as a promising paradigm for decentralized
model training, enabling multiple clients to collaboratively learn a shared
model without exchanging their local data. However, the decentralized nature of
FL also introduces vulnerabilities, as malicious clients can compromise or
manipulate the training process. In this work, we introduce dictator clients, a
novel, well-defined, and analytically tractable class of malicious participants
capable of entirely erasing the contributions of all other clients from the
server model, while preserving their own. We propose concrete attack strategies
that empower such clients and systematically analyze their effects on the
learning process. Furthermore, we explore complex scenarios involving multiple
dictator clients, including cases where they collaborate, act independently, or
form an alliance in order to ultimately betray one another. For each of these
settings, we provide a theoretical analysis of their impact on the global
model's convergence. Our theoretical algorithms and findings about the complex
scenarios including multiple dictator clients are further supported by
empirical evaluations on both computer vision and natural language processing
benchmarks.

TL;DR: PCC-MJO是一个深度学习框架，作为通用后处理器来修正动力模型的MJO预报。该两阶段模型通过物理引导的3D U-Net修正时空场误差，然后用LSTM优化RMM指数预报技巧，将有效预报范围延长2-8天。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MJO是全球天气和气候极端事件的重要驱动因子，但业务动力模型对其预报仍具挑战性，技巧性预报通常仅限于3-4周。需要突破次季节预报的长期障碍。

Method: 提出物理引导级联校正器(PCC-MJO)框架：第一阶段使用物理信息3D U-Net修正时空场误差，第二阶段使用LSTM优化MJO的RMM指数预报技巧。

Result: 应用于CMA、ECMWF和NCEP三个业务预报时，该统一框架将技巧性预报范围（双变量相关>0.5）一致延长2-8天，有效缓解了'海洋大陆障碍'，实现了更真实的向东传播和振幅。

Conclusion: 该工作提供了一条物理一致、计算高效且高度可推广的途径，突破了次季节预报中的长期障碍，模型决策与观测到的MJO动力学空间一致，表明学习的是物理上有意义的特征而非统计拟合。

Abstract: The Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO) is an important driver of global weather
and climate extremes, but its prediction in operational dynamical models
remains challenging, with skillful forecasts typically limited to 3-4 weeks.
Here, we introduce a novel deep learning framework, the Physics-guided Cascaded
Corrector for MJO (PCC-MJO), which acts as a universal post-processor to
correct MJO forecasts from dynamical models. This two-stage model first employs
a physics-informed 3D U-Net to correct spatial-temporal field errors, then
refines the MJO's RMM index using an LSTM optimized for forecast skill. When
applied to three different operational forecasts from CMA, ECMWF and NCEP, our
unified framework consistently extends the skillful forecast range (bivariate
correlation > 0.5) by 2-8 days. Crucially, the model effectively mitigates the
"Maritime Continent barrier", enabling more realistic eastward propagation and
amplitude. Explainable AI analysis quantitatively confirms that the model's
decision-making is spatially congruent with observed MJO dynamics (correlation
> 0.93), demonstrating that it learns physically meaningful features rather
than statistical fittings. Our work provides a promising physically consistent,
computationally efficient, and highly generalizable pathway to break through
longstanding barriers in subseasonal forecasting.

TL;DR: Sentinel是一个用于物联网入侵检测的个性化联邦学习框架，通过双模型架构解决类别不平衡、非IID数据和通信开销问题，在保持隐私的同时显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统联邦学习方法在物联网入侵检测系统中面临严重的类别不平衡、非IID数据分布和高通信开销问题，导致性能下降，需要新的解决方案。

Method: 提出个性化联邦IDS框架Sentinel，采用双模型架构（个性化教师模型和轻量级共享学生模型），结合双向知识蒸馏、多层面特征对齐和类别平衡损失函数，服务器使用标准化梯度聚合。

Result: 在IoTID20和5GNIDD数据集上的实验表明，Sentinel显著优于现有联邦学习方法，在极端数据异构情况下建立新的性能基准，同时保持通信效率。

Conclusion: Sentinel框架通过个性化联邦学习方法有效解决了物联网入侵检测中的关键挑战，为联邦学习在现实网络流量分类中的应用提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) offers a privacy-preserving paradigm for machine
learning, but its application in intrusion detection systems (IDS) within IoT
networks is challenged by severe class imbalance, non-IID data, and high
communication overhead.These challenges severely degrade the performance of
conventional FL methods in real-world network traffic classification. To
overcome these limitations, we propose Sentinel, a personalized federated IDS
(pFed-IDS) framework that incorporates a dual-model architecture on each
client, consisting of a personalized teacher and a lightweight shared student
model. This design effectively balances deep local adaptation with efficient
global model consensus while preserving client privacy by transmitting only the
compact student model, thus reducing communication costs. Sentinel integrates
three key mechanisms to ensure robust performance: bidirectional knowledge
distillation with adaptive temperature scaling, multi-faceted feature
alignment, and class-balanced loss functions. Furthermore, the server employs
normalized gradient aggregation with equal client weighting to enhance fairness
and mitigate client drift. Extensive experiments on the IoTID20 and 5GNIDD
benchmark datasets demonstrate that Sentinel significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art federated methods, establishing a new performance benchmark,
especially under extreme data heterogeneity, while maintaining communication
efficiency.

Motivation: 当前主流方法主要关注架构修改和优化策略，但缺乏对模态间不平衡程度的定量分析。本文旨在填补这一空白，通过定量分析来指导损失函数设计。

Method: 定义模态差距为不同模态对真实类别预测的Softmax分数差异，使用双峰高斯混合模型建模模态差距分布，识别平衡和不平衡样本，然后设计自适应损失函数并采用两阶段训练策略。

Conclusion: 所提出的定量分析方法有效改善了多模态不平衡问题，验证了该方法的有效性。

Abstract: Current mainstream approaches to addressing multimodal imbalance primarily
focus on architectural modifications and optimization-based, often overlooking
a quantitative analysis of the imbalance degree between modalities. To address
this gap, our work introduces a novel method for the quantitative analysis of
multi-modal imbalance, which in turn informs the design of a sample-level
adaptive loss function.We begin by defining the "Modality Gap" as the
difference between the Softmax scores of different modalities (e.g., audio and
visual) for the ground-truth class prediction. Analysis of the Modality Gap
distribution reveals that it can be effectively modeled by a bimodal Gaussian
Mixture Model (GMM). These two components are found to correspond respectively
to "modality-balanced" and "modality-imbalanced" data samples. Subsequently, we
apply Bayes' theorem to compute the posterior probability of each sample
belonging to these two distinct distributions.Informed by this quantitative
analysis, we design a novel adaptive loss function with three objectives: (1)
to minimize the overall Modality Gap; (2) to encourage the imbalanced sample
distribution to shift towards the balanced one; and (3) to apply greater
penalty weights to imbalanced samples. We employ a two-stage training strategy
consisting of a warm-up phase followed by an adaptive training
phase.Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves
state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on the public CREMA-D and AVE datasets,
attaining accuracies of $80.65\%$ and $70.90\%$, respectively. This validates
the effectiveness of our proposed methodology.

Result: AirFed相比最先进基线方法实现了42.9%的加权成本降低，达到超过99%的截止时间满意度和94.2%的物联网设备覆盖率，通信开销减少54.5%。

Conclusion: 可扩展性分析证实了AirFed在不同无人机数量、物联网设备密度和系统规模下的稳健性能，验证了其在大规模无人机-移动边缘计算部署中的实际适用性。

Abstract: Multiple Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) cooperative Mobile Edge Computing
(MEC) systems face critical challenges in coordinating trajectory planning,
task offloading, and resource allocation while ensuring Quality of Service
(QoS) under dynamic and uncertain environments. Existing approaches suffer from
limited scalability, slow convergence, and inefficient knowledge sharing among
UAVs, particularly when handling large-scale IoT device deployments with
stringent deadline constraints. This paper proposes AirFed, a novel federated
graph-enhanced multi-agent reinforcement learning framework that addresses
these challenges through three key innovations. First, we design dual-layer
dynamic Graph Attention Networks (GATs) that explicitly model spatial-temporal
dependencies among UAVs and IoT devices, capturing both service relationships
and collaborative interactions within the network topology. Second, we develop
a dual-Actor single-Critic architecture that jointly optimizes continuous
trajectory control and discrete task offloading decisions. Third, we propose a
reputation-based decentralized federated learning mechanism with
gradient-sensitive adaptive quantization, enabling efficient and robust
knowledge sharing across heterogeneous UAVs. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that AirFed achieves 42.9% reduction in weighted cost compared to
state-of-the-art baselines, attains over 99% deadline satisfaction and 94.2%
IoT device coverage rate, and reduces communication overhead by 54.5%.
Scalability analysis confirms robust performance across varying UAV numbers,
IoT device densities, and system scales, validating AirFed's practical
applicability for large-scale UAV-MEC deployments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 矩阵预条件优化器（如Muon）在大规模神经网络训练中比标量优化器更高效，而方差缩减技术（如MARS）在LLM预训练中能显著加速。为了结合两者的优势，开发了MARS-M。

Method: 将MARS的方差缩减技术与Muon的矩阵预条件方法相结合，创建新的优化器MARS-M。

Result: 理论证明MARS-M以$\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(T^{-1/3})$的速率收敛到一阶驻点，优于Muon的$\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(T^{-1/4})$速率。实验结果显示在语言建模和计算机视觉任务中，MARS-M能持续获得更低的损失和更好的下游任务性能。

Conclusion: MARS-M成功结合了矩阵预条件和方差缩减技术的优势，在理论和实验上都表现出优于现有方法的性能。

Abstract: Matrix-based preconditioned optimizers, such as Muon, have recently been
shown to be more efficient than scalar-based optimizers for training
large-scale neural networks, including large language models (LLMs). On the
other hand, recent benchmarks on optimizers for LLM pre-training have
demonstrated that variance-reduction techniques such as MARS can achieve
substantial speedups over standard optimizers that do not employ variance
reduction. In this paper, to achieve the best of both worlds, we introduce
MARS-M, a new optimizer that integrates the variance reduction technique in
MARS with Muon. Under standard regularity conditions, we prove that Muon-M
converges to a first-order stationary point at a rate of
$\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(T^{-1/3})$, which improves upon
$\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(T^{-1/4})$ rate attained by Muon. Our empirical results on
language modeling and computer vision tasks demonstrate that MARS-M
consistently yields lower losses and improved performance across various
downstream benchmarks. The implementation of MARS-M is available at

Motivation: 纯数据驱动的流体动力学代理模型往往因误差累积而失败，而现有混合方法缺乏自动化和鲁棒性，无法实际应用。

Method: 开发XRePIT混合仿真策略，结合机器学习加速和求解器修正，设计为完全自动化和物理感知，确保稳定性和实用性。

Abstract: Purely data-driven surrogates for fluid dynamics often fail catastrophically
from error accumulation, while existing hybrid methods have lacked the
automation and robustness for practical use. To solve this, we developed
XRePIT, a novel hybrid simulation strategy that synergizes machine learning
(ML) acceleration with solver-based correction. We specifically designed our
method to be fully automated and physics-aware, ensuring the stability and
practical applicability that previous approaches lacked. We demonstrate that
this new design overcomes long-standing barriers, achieving the first stable,
accelerated rollouts for over 10,000 timesteps. The method also generalizes
robustly to unseen boundary conditions and, crucially, scales to 3D flows. Our
approach delivers speedups up to 4.98$\times$ while maintaining high physical
fidelity, resolving thermal fields with relative errors of ~1E-3 and capturing
low magnitude velocity dynamics with errors below 1E-2 ms-1. This work thus
establishes a mature and scalable hybrid method, paving the way for its use in
real-world engineering.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决机场雾短期预报在地理泛化方面的挑战，因为许多机器学习模型依赖位置特定特征而无法跨站点迁移。

Method: 使用梯度提升分类器(XGBoost)在圣地亚哥机场数据上训练，采用坐标无关特征集，并在其他三个机场进行零样本测试。

Result: 模型在距离达11,650公里的不同雾况下实现了0.923-0.947的AUC值，SHAP特征排名显示能见度持续性、太阳角度和热梯度主导预测。

Conclusion: 基于物理的坐标无关特征工程可以产生地理可迁移的大气预报工具。

Abstract: Short-term forecasting of airport fog (visibility < 1.0 km) presents
challenges in geographic generalization because many machine learning models
rely on location-specific features and fail to transfer across sites. This
study investigates whether fundamental thermodynamic and radiative processes
can be encoded in a coordinate-free (location-independent) feature set to
enable geographic transferability. A gradient boosting classifier (XGBoost)
trained on Santiago, Chile (SCEL, 33S) data from 2002-2009 was evaluated on a
2010-2012 holdout set and under strict zero-shot tests at Puerto Montt (SCTE),
San Francisco (KSFO), and London (EGLL). The model achieved AUC values of
0.923-0.947 across distances up to 11,650 km and different fog regimes
(radiative, advective, marine). Consistent SHAP feature rankings show that
visibility persistence, solar angle, and thermal gradients dominate
predictions, suggesting the model learned transferable physical relationships
rather than site-specific patterns. Results suggest that physics-informed,
coordinate-free feature engineering can yield geographically transferable
atmospheric forecasting tools.

Conclusion: HAIN通过协调预测准确性和可解释性，推进了精准医疗和监管合规透明AI解决方案的发展。

Abstract: The proliferation of high-dimensional datasets in fields such as genomics,
healthcare, and finance has created an urgent need for machine learning models
that are both highly accurate and inherently interpretable. While traditional
deep learning approaches deliver strong predictive performance, their lack of
transparency often impedes their deployment in critical, decision-sensitive
applications. In this work, we introduce the Hierarchical Attention-based
Interpretable Network (HAIN), a novel architecture that unifies multi-level
attention mechanisms, dimensionality reduction, and explanation-driven loss
functions to deliver interpretable and robust analysis of complex biomedical
data. HAIN provides feature-level interpretability via gradientweighted
attention and offers global model explanations through prototype-based
representations. Comprehensive evaluation on The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)
dataset demonstrates that HAIN achieves a classification accuracy of 94.3%,
surpassing conventional post-hoc interpretability approaches such as SHAP and
LIME in both transparency and explanatory power. Furthermore, HAIN effectively
identifies biologically relevant cancer biomarkers, supporting its utility for
clinical and research applications. By harmonizing predictive accuracy with
interpretability, HAIN advances the development of transparent AI solutions for
precision medicine and regulatory compliance.

Method: 使用多尺度Dubuc距离(MDD)评估时间序列相似性，该方法在多时间尺度上分析并避免点对点对齐。通过模拟实验和UCR档案库的95个数据集进行测试，并将两种方法应用于实际分类任务。

Result: 在MDD优于DTW的场景中，性能提升显著。在真实世界分类任务中，MDD相比DTW带来了明显改进，证明了其实际效用。

Conclusion: MDD作为一种新颖的时间序列相似性度量方法，在多尺度分析和避免点对点对齐方面具有独特优势，在许多情况下能够显著超越传统DTW方法。

Abstract: Time series are high-dimensional and complex data objects, making their
efficient search and indexing a longstanding challenge in data mining. Building
on a recently introduced similarity measure, namely Multiscale Dubuc Distance
(MDD), this paper investigates its comparative strengths and limitations
relative to the widely used Dynamic Time Warping (DTW). MDD is novel in two key
ways: it evaluates time series similarity across multiple temporal scales and
avoids point-to-point alignment. We demonstrate that in many scenarios where
MDD outperforms DTW, the gains are substantial, and we provide a detailed
analysis of the specific performance gaps it addresses. We provide simulations,
in addition to the 95 datasets from the UCR archive, to test our hypotheses.
Finally, we apply both methods to a challenging real-world classification task
and show that MDD yields a significant improvement over DTW, underscoring its
practical utility.

Motivation: 现实世界代码编辑场景中，奖励分布经常偏斜且包含不可预测的异常值，导致优势计算失真和噪声增加。

Method: GAPO方法为每个提示自适应找到无异常值的最高密度区间，使用该区间中位数作为自适应Q值来替代组均值进行优势计算。

Result: 在9个指令调优的LLM（3B-14B）和包含51,844个真实世界代码编辑任务的数据集上验证，相比GRPO及其变体DAPO在精确匹配准确率上获得一致提升。

Conclusion: GAPO能鲁棒处理偏斜分布，保持即插即用和高效率，在代码编辑任务中表现优于现有方法。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) is widely used for post-training large language
models (LLMs) in code editing, where group-relative methods like GRPO are
popular for their critic-free, normalized advantage estimation. However, in
real-world code-editing scenarios, reward distributions are often skewed with
unpredictable outliers, leading to distorted advantage computation and
increased noise. To address this issue, we propose Group Adaptive Policy
Optimization (GAPO), which adaptively finds an outlier-free highest-density
interval (HDI) per prompt and then uses the median of that interval as an
adaptive Q to replace the group mean in advantage calculation. This adaptive Q
robustly handles skewed distributions while remaining plug-and-play and
efficient. We validate GAPO on nine instruction-tuned LLMs (3B-14B) using a
large internal dataset of 51,844 real-world, history-aware code-editing tasks
across 10 languages, demonstrating consistent improvements in exact match
accuracy over GRPO and its variant DAPO. Code is publicly available.

TL;DR: 提出RestoreLCC方法，通过对比探测关键注意力头并补偿丢失的激活组件，有效恢复剪枝后LLM的性能，同时保持模型稀疏性和推理效率。


<details>

Motivation: 现有参数高效微调方法主要针对密集模型设计，忽视了剪枝模型的特性，导致性能恢复效果不佳。剪枝造成的信息损失反映在注意力激活中，选择性恢复这些信息可显著提升模型性能。

Method: RestoreLCC方法：通过激活编辑对比探测关键注意力头，从激活差异中提取丢失组件，然后将其注入到对应的剪枝头中进行补偿恢复。该方法兼容结构化、半结构化和非结构化剪枝方案。

Result: 大量实验表明，RestoreLCC在通用和任务特定性能恢复方面均优于现有最优基线方法，且不损害剪枝模型的稀疏性或推理效率。

Conclusion: RestoreLCC是一种即插即用的方法，能够有效恢复剪枝LLM的性能，同时保持其低成本和高效率特性，为剪枝模型的实际应用提供了有力支持。

Abstract: Pruning is a widely used technique to reduce the size and inference cost of
large language models (LLMs), but it often causes performance degradation. To
mitigate this, existing restoration methods typically employ
parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT), such as LoRA, to recover the pruned
model's performance. However, most PEFT methods are designed for dense models
and overlook the distinct properties of pruned models, often resulting in
suboptimal recovery. In this work, we propose a targeted restoration strategy
for pruned models that restores performance while preserving their low cost and
high efficiency. We observe that pruning-induced information loss is reflected
in attention activations, and selectively reintroducing components of this
information can significantly recover model performance. Based on this insight,
we introduce RestoreLCC (Restoring Pruned LLMs via Lost Component
Compensation), a plug-and-play method that contrastively probes critical
attention heads via activation editing, extracts lost components from
activation differences, and finally injects them back into the corresponding
pruned heads for compensation and recovery. RestoreLCC is compatible with
structured, semi-structured, and unstructured pruning schemes. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that RestoreLCC consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines in both general and task-specific performance
recovery, without compromising the sparsity or inference efficiency of pruned
models.

*Nayan Kumar Singh*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出一个端到端的多任务系统，通过单张图像生成事实准确的商品描述。采用多任务学习微调视觉编码器，并结合分层生成过程来减少事实幻觉。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 手动生成商品描述耗时耗力，现有视觉语言模型存在事实幻觉问题，且单任务模型无法捕捉特征间的依赖关系。

Method: 1. 多任务学习：单一视觉主干网络联合训练属性预测（颜色、下摆、领型）和价格回归；2. 分层生成：将模型预测的属性嵌入提示中，输入文本解码器以提高事实一致性。

Result: 多任务方法在价格回归上R2值提升3.6%，属性分类F1分数提升6.6%；分层生成将事实幻觉率从12.7%降至7.1%（相对减少44.5%），自回归文本生成延迟减少3.5倍。

Conclusion: 该架构在减少事实幻觉和提高效率方面表现优异，虽然在ROUGE-L得分上比直接视觉语言模型略差3.5%，但整体效果显著。

Abstract: Manually generating catchy descriptions and names is labor intensive and a
slow process for retailers. Although generative AI provides an automation
solution in form of Vision to Language Models (VLM), the current VLMs are prone
to factual "hallucinations". Siloed, single task models are not only
inefficient but also fail to capture interdependent relationships between
features. To address these challenges, we propose an end to end, multi task
system that generates factually grounded textual listings from a single image.
The contributions of this study are two proposals for the model architecture.
First, application of multi task learning approach for fine tuning a vision
encoder where a single vision backbone is jointly trained on attribute
prediction such as color, hemline and neck style and price regression. Second,
introduction of a hierarchical generation process where the model's own
predicted attributes are embedded in a prompt and fed to the text decoder to
improve factual consistency. The experiments demonstrate the superiority of
this architecture. The multi tasking approach outperforms both the independent
price regression, with a 3.6% better R2 Value and attribute classification,
with a 6.6% improvement F1 score. Critically, the hierarchical generation
process proves highly effective, slashing the factual hallucination rate from
12.7% to 7.1%, a 44.5% relative reduction, compared to a non hierarchical
ablation. The hierarchical approach also reduces the latency of the
autoregressive text generation process by a factor of 3.5 when compared to
direct vision to language model of similar size. One minor caveat is that the
model does perform 3.5% worse than direct vision-to-language model on ROUGE-L
score.

Conclusion: COLA框架使大语言模型能够高效学习新任务，对先前任务性能影响极小，且无需保留早期训练数据

Abstract: Learning a set of tasks over time, also known as continual learning (CL), is
one of the most challenging problems in artificial intelligence due to
catastrophic forgetting. Large language models (LLMs) are often impractical to
frequent re-training and continual learning , due to high cost of computational
resources for training. Moreover, LLM are not suitable for continual learning
as updating these models over time for acquiring new knowledge leads to
overwrites existing knowledge leading to common phenomenon know as
\textit{catastrophic forgetting}. In this paper, we aim to address these
concerns using a novel framework , COLA that employs an autoencoder to learn
capture low-dimensional embeddings of the weights associated with various
tasks. Our approach facilitates the transfer of knowledge to new tasks while
preventing catastrophic forgetting, all without using data replay or a
substantial set of task-specific parameters. Our approach, COLA, makes the LLM
efficiently learn new tasks with minimal training, insignificant performance
degradation on previous tasks, and eliminates the need for retaining earlier
training data. Empirical evaluation on different datasets ranging from task
oriented dialouge system to intent classsfication datasets showcases that our
method not only overcomes catastrophic forgetting but also achieves significant
reduction in parameter usage and memory size, across multiple tasks and
outperforming the existing state of the art methods across multiple datasets.

Motivation: 大型语言模型参数规模庞大导致计算和环境负担严重，现有压缩方法忽略了复杂的层间相关性，需要更有效的压缩技术。

Method: 采用iPEPS捕获注意力机制和深度transformer层中的多向纠缠，使用TRG确保多项式时间收缩，实现可行的张量化同时保持关键相关性几何结构。

Result: 在LLaMA-2 7B模型上实现93%内存减少、70%参数减少、50%训练加速、25%推理加速，仅损失2-3%精度。层间纠缠分析显示深层存在冗余。

Conclusion: 现代LLM占据低维纠缠流形，KARIPAP证明了可扩展、节能且量子感知的AI架构的可行性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT and LLaMA drive rapid progress in
generative AI, yet their huge parameter scales create severe computational and
environmental burdens. High training costs, energy use, and limited device
deployment hinder accessibility. Existing compression - pruning, distillation,
low-rank, and quantization - reduces size but ignores complex inter-layer
correlations. We propose KARIPAP, a quantum-inspired tensor network compression
using Infinite Projected Entangled Pair States (iPEPS) and Tensor
Renormalization Group (TRG) contraction. Unlike 1D Matrix Product States, iPEPS
captures multi-directional entanglement in attention and deep transformer
layers. TRG ensures polynomial-time contraction, making tensorization feasible
while preserving key correlation geometry. Experiments on LLaMA-2 7B show up to
93% memory and 70% parameter reduction, with 50% faster training, 25% faster
inference, and only 2-3% accuracy loss. Layer-wise entanglement profiling
reveals redundancy in deeper layers, confirming their suitability for tensor
factorization. KARIPAP demonstrates that modern LLMs occupy low-dimensional
entanglement manifolds, enabling scalable, energy-efficient, and quantum-aware
AI architectures.

Motivation: 现有成员推理攻击方法通常依赖影子模型或大量查询访问，实用性受限，需要更高效且可解释的替代方案。

Method: 使用高斯过程元建模，利用训练后指标（准确率、熵、数据集统计等）和可选敏感特征（梯度、NTK度量）训练GP分类器来区分成员和非成员。

Result: 在合成数据、真实欺诈检测数据、CIFAR-10和WikiText-2上的实验表明，GP-MIA实现了高准确率和良好泛化能力。

Conclusion: GP-MIA为现有成员推理攻击提供了实用的替代方案，具有高效性、可解释性和校准的不确定性估计。

Abstract: Membership inference attacks (MIAs) test whether a data point was part of a
model's training set, posing serious privacy risks. Existing methods often
depend on shadow models or heavy query access, which limits their practicality.
We propose GP-MIA, an efficient and interpretable approach based on Gaussian
process (GP) meta-modeling. Using post-hoc metrics such as accuracy, entropy,
dataset statistics, and optional sensitivity features (e.g. gradients, NTK
measures) from a single trained model, GP-MIA trains a GP classifier to
distinguish members from non-members while providing calibrated uncertainty
estimates. Experiments on synthetic data, real-world fraud detection data,
CIFAR-10, and WikiText-2 show that GP-MIA achieves high accuracy and
generalizability, offering a practical alternative to existing MIAs.

Motivation: 降水临近预报面临确定性模型预测过度平滑难以捕捉极端事件，概率模型性能波动且难以在所有指标上同时达到最优，以及多个评估指标之间存在冲突（如CSI和FAR的权衡）等挑战。

Method: 提出SynCast方法，采用Diffusion-SPO两阶段后训练框架：第一阶段专注于降低FAR，训练模型有效抑制误报；第二阶段在保持FAR对齐的基础上进一步优化CSI，实现冲突指标的协同改进。

Result: 该方法能够协同优化冲突的评估指标，在降水临近预报中实现一致的优越性能。

Conclusion: 首次将偏好优化引入降水临近预报领域，通过两阶段训练框架有效解决了多个冲突指标的协同优化问题，为极端天气监测和防灾减灾提供了更可靠的预测工具。

Abstract: Precipitation nowcasting based on radar echoes plays a crucial role in
monitoring extreme weather and supporting disaster prevention. Although deep
learning approaches have achieved significant progress, they still face notable
limitations. For example, deterministic models tend to produce over-smoothed
predictions, which struggle to capture extreme events and fine-scale
precipitation patterns. Probabilistic generative models, due to their inherent
randomness, often show fluctuating performance across different metrics and
rarely achieve consistently optimal results. Furthermore, precipitation
nowcasting is typically evaluated using multiple metrics, some of which are
inherently conflicting. For instance, there is often a trade-off between the
Critical Success Index (CSI) and the False Alarm Ratio (FAR), making it
challenging for existing models to deliver forecasts that perform well on both
metrics simultaneously. To address these challenges, we introduce preference
optimization into precipitation nowcasting for the first time, motivated by the
success of reinforcement learning from human feedback in large language models.
Specifically, we propose SynCast, a method that employs the two-stage
post-training framework of Diffusion Sequential Preference Optimization
(Diffusion-SPO), to progressively align conflicting metrics and consistently
achieve superior performance. In the first stage, the framework focuses on
reducing FAR, training the model to effectively suppress false alarms. Building
on this foundation, the second stage further optimizes CSI with constraints
that preserve FAR alignment, thereby achieving synergistic improvements across
these conflicting metrics.

Motivation: 现有的视觉语言模型大多以英语为中心设计，限制了其在多语言环境中的有效性。本文旨在通过系统研究多语言设计选择来提升多语言视觉语言模型的性能。

Method: 通过分析训练数据组成、编码器选择和文本主干等关键设计选择，基于多语言文本模型Tower+构建TowerVision模型家族，并发布高质量视觉语言数据集VisionBlocks。

Result: TowerVision在多个多模态多语言基准测试中取得竞争性表现，在文化相关任务和多模态翻译方面表现突出，甚至超越了基于更大数据集训练的现有方法。

Conclusion: 多语言视觉语言训练数据显著改善了跨语言泛化能力，指令调优的大语言模型并非总是最佳初始化选择。作者公开了所有模型、数据和训练方法以支持进一步研究。

Abstract: Despite significant advances in vision-language models (VLMs), most existing
work follows an English-centric design process, limiting their effectiveness in
multilingual settings. In this work, we provide a comprehensive empirical study
analyzing the impact of several multilingual design choices, such as training
data composition, encoder selection, and text backbones. The result is
TowerVision, a family of open multilingual VLMs for both image-text and
video-text tasks, built upon the multilingual text-only model Tower+.
TowerVision achieves competitive performance on multiple multimodal
multilingual benchmarks and shows particular strength in culturally grounded
tasks and multimodal translation. By incorporating visual and cultural context
during fine-tuning, our models surpass existing approaches trained on
substantially larger datasets, as demonstrated on ALM-Bench and Multi30K (image
tasks) and ViMUL-Bench (video tasks). Alongside the models, we release
VisionBlocks, a high-quality, curated vision-language dataset. Our findings
highlight that multilingual vision-language training data substantially
improves cross-lingual generalization -- both from high-resource to
underrepresented languages and vice versa -- and that instruction-tuned LLMs
are not always the optimal initialization point. To support further research,
we publicly release all models, data, and training recipes.

Motivation: 传统DEIM方法在投影基降阶模型中虽然能有效近似非线性项，但其固定的插值点限制了适应复杂时变动力学的能力。

Method: 开发了可微分自适应DEIM公式，允许神经网络动态选择插值点；并将DEIM作为可解释分析工具来检查预训练NODE模型的学习动力学。

Result: DEIM轨迹揭示了NODE学习动力学中的物理意义特征，并暴露了其在未见流配置外推时的局限性。

Conclusion: DEIM不仅可作为模型降阶工具，还能作为诊断框架来理解和改进神经微分方程模型的泛化行为。

Abstract: We present a differentiable framework that leverages the Discrete Empirical
Interpolation Method (DEIM) for interpretable deep learning and dynamical
system analysis. Although DEIM efficiently approximates nonlinear terms in
projection-based reduced-order models (POD-ROM), its fixed interpolation points
limit the adaptability to complex and time-varying dynamics. To address this
limitation, we first develop a differentiable adaptive DEIM formulation for the
one-dimensional viscous Burgers equation, which allows neural networks to
dynamically select interpolation points in a computationally efficient and
physically consistent manner. We then apply DEIM as an interpretable analysis
tool for examining the learned dynamics of a pre-trained Neural Ordinary
Differential Equation (NODE) on a two-dimensional vortex-merging problem. The
DEIM trajectories reveal physically meaningful features in the learned dynamics
of NODE and expose its limitations when extrapolating to unseen flow
configurations. These findings demonstrate that DEIM can serve not only as a
model reduction tool but also as a diagnostic framework for understanding and
improving the generalization behavior of neural differential equation models.

TL;DR: 提出了一种面向多能源系统的隐私保护决策聚焦学习框架，通过信息掩蔽和安全协议解决传统方法中的隐私泄露问题，在保护敏感数据的同时降低调度成本。


<details>

Motivation: 传统多能源系统负荷预测与决策分离，预测模型仅关注预测精度而忽略对下游决策的影响。决策聚焦学习虽能最小化决策成本，但在实际应用中面临严重的隐私问题，需要跨部门共享敏感负荷数据和模型参数。

Method: 采用信息掩蔽技术保护私有数据，同时恢复模型训练所需的决策变量和梯度；设计结合矩阵分解和同态加密的安全协议，防止合谋和未授权访问；开发隐私保护的负荷模式识别算法，为异构负荷模式训练专门的DFL模型。

Conclusion: 所提出的隐私保护DFL框架成功解决了多能源系统中决策聚焦学习的实际部署障碍，在保障数据安全的同时提升了调度决策的经济性。

Abstract: Decision-making for multi-energy system (MES) dispatch depends on accurate
load forecasting. Traditionally, load forecasting and decision-making for MES
are implemented separately. Forecasting models are typically trained to
minimize forecasting errors, overlooking their impact on downstream
decision-making. To address this, decision-focused learning (DFL) has been
studied to minimize decision-making costs instead. However, practical adoption
of DFL in MES faces significant challenges: the process requires sharing
sensitive load data and model parameters across multiple sectors, raising
serious privacy issues. To this end, we propose a privacy-preserving DFL
framework tailored for MES. Our approach introduces information masking to
safeguard private data while enabling recovery of decision variables and
gradients required for model training. To further enhance security for DFL, we
design a safety protocol combining matrix decomposition and homomorphic
encryption, effectively preventing collusion and unauthorized data access.
Additionally, we developed a privacy-preserving load pattern recognition
algorithm, enabling the training of specialized DFL models for heterogeneous
load patterns. Theoretical analysis and comprehensive case studies, including
real-world MES data, demonstrate that our framework not only protects privacy
but also consistently achieves lower average daily dispatch costs compared to
existing methods.

Abstract: With the remarkable success of deep learning, applying such techniques to EM
methods has emerged as a promising research direction to overcome the
limitations of conventional approaches. The effectiveness of deep learning
methods depends heavily on the quality of datasets, which directly influences
model performance and generalization ability. Existing application studies
often construct datasets from random one-dimensional or structurally simple
three-dimensional models, which fail to represent the complexity of real
geological environments. Furthermore, the absence of standardized, publicly
available three-dimensional geoelectric datasets continues to hinder progress
in deep learning based EM exploration. To address these limitations, we present
OpenEM, a large scale, multi structural three dimensional geoelectric dataset
that encompasses a broad range of geologically plausible subsurface structures.
OpenEM consists of nine categories of geoelectric models, spanning from simple
configurations with anomalous bodies in half space to more complex structures
such as flat layers, folded layers, flat faults, curved faults, and their
corresponding variants with anomalous bodies. Since three-dimensional forward
modeling in electromagnetics is extremely time-consuming, we further developed
a deep learning based fast forward modeling approach for OpenEM, enabling
efficient and reliable forward modeling across the entire dataset. This
capability allows OpenEM to be rapidly deployed for a wide range of tasks.
OpenEM provides a unified, comprehensive, and large-scale dataset for common EM
exploration systems to accelerate the application of deep learning in
electromagnetic methods. The complete dataset, along with the forward modeling
codes and trained models, is publicly available at

Motivation: 研究大型语言模型是否真正具备反思推理能力，测试在无外部反馈的递归自我评估中是否会产生实质性进展而非仅仅是重新表述。

Method: 跨提供商研究，使用三种模型（GPT-4o-mini、Claude 3 Haiku、Gemini 2.0 Flash）在四种任务类型上进行10次迭代，比较无基础自批判和最小基础干预两种条件。

Result: 无基础运行中信息变化从早期到后期下降55%，而基础运行在干预后信息变化反弹28%并保持非零方差。所有补充测量指标都显示相同模式。

Conclusion: 生成推理中的自我修正存在结构性限制，无独立验证者的递归推理会趋向认知停滞状态，最小基础干预可作为耗散耦合重新引入信息流动。

Abstract: Large language models are often described as capable of reflective reasoning,
yet recursive self-evaluation without external feedback frequently yields
reformulation rather than progress. We test this prediction in a cross-provider
study of 144 reasoning sequences across three models (OpenAI GPT-4o-mini,
Anthropic Claude 3 Haiku, and Google Gemini 2.0 Flash) and four task families
(arithmetic, code, explanation, reflection), each iterated ten times under two
conditions: ungrounded self-critique and a minimal grounding intervention (a
single verification step at iteration three). Mean informational change (delta
I, measured via normalized edit distance) declined by 55% from early (0.193) to
late (0.087) iterations in ungrounded runs, with consistent patterns across all
three providers. Grounded runs showed a +28% rebound in informational change
immediately after the intervention and sustained non-zero variance thereafter.
Complementary measures-n-gram novelty, embedding drift, and character-level
entropy-converged on the same pattern: reflection without contact tends toward
informational closure. We interpret this as evidence for a structural limit on
self-correction in generative reasoning: without an exchange of information
with an independent verifier or environment, recursive inference approaches an
attractor state of epistemic stasis. Minimal grounding functions as dissipative
coupling, reintroducing informational flux. The cross-architecture consistency
suggests the mirror loop arises from shared autoregressive training objectives
rather than provider-specific alignment schemes. The results delineate when
reflection is performative rather than epistemic and motivate design principles
for grounded, cooperative reasoning. Materials and code are publicly available.

Abstract: This monograph presents the core principles that have guided the development
of diffusion models, tracing their origins and showing how diverse formulations
arise from shared mathematical ideas. Diffusion modeling starts by defining a
forward process that gradually corrupts data into noise, linking the data
distribution to a simple prior through a continuum of intermediate
distributions. The goal is to learn a reverse process that transforms noise
back into data while recovering the same intermediates. We describe three
complementary views. The variational view, inspired by variational
autoencoders, sees diffusion as learning to remove noise step by step. The
score-based view, rooted in energy-based modeling, learns the gradient of the
evolving data distribution, indicating how to nudge samples toward more likely
regions. The flow-based view, related to normalizing flows, treats generation
as following a smooth path that moves samples from noise to data under a
learned velocity field. These perspectives share a common backbone: a
time-dependent velocity field whose flow transports a simple prior to the data.
Sampling then amounts to solving a differential equation that evolves noise
into data along a continuous trajectory. On this foundation, the monograph
discusses guidance for controllable generation, efficient numerical solvers,
and diffusion-motivated flow-map models that learn direct mappings between
arbitrary times. It provides a conceptual and mathematically grounded
understanding of diffusion models for readers with basic deep-learning
knowledge.

Abstract: The performance of machine learning and pattern recognition algorithms
generally depends on data representation. That is why, much of the current
effort in performing machine learning algorithms goes into the design of
preprocessing frameworks and data transformations able to support effective
machine learning. The method proposed in this work consists of a hybrid linear
feature extraction scheme to be used in supervised multi-class classification
problems. Inspired by two recent linear discriminant methods: robust sparse
linear discriminant analysis (RSLDA) and inter-class sparsitybased
discriminative least square regression (ICS_DLSR), we propose a unifying
criterion that is able to retain the advantages of these two powerful methods.
The resulting transformation relies on sparsity-promoting techniques both to
select the features that most accurately represent the data and to preserve the
row-sparsity consistency property of samples from the same class. The linear
transformation and the orthogonal matrix are estimated using an iterative
alternating minimization scheme based on steepest descent gradient method and
different initialization schemes. The proposed framework is generic in the
sense that it allows the combination and tuning of other linear discriminant
embedding methods. According to the experiments conducted on several datasets
including faces, objects, and digits, the proposed method was able to
outperform competing methods in most cases.

Abstract: Large language models remain vulnerable to jailbreak attacks that bypass
safety guardrails to elicit harmful outputs. Defending against novel jailbreaks
represents a critical challenge in AI safety. Adversarial training -- designed
to make models robust against worst-case perturbations -- has been the dominant
paradigm for adversarial robustness. However, due to optimization challenges
and difficulties in defining realistic threat models, adversarial training
methods often fail on newly developed jailbreaks in practice. This paper
proposes a new paradigm for improving robustness against unseen jailbreaks,
centered on the Adversarial D\'ej\`a Vu hypothesis: novel jailbreaks are not
fundamentally new, but largely recombinations of adversarial skills from
previous attacks. We study this hypothesis through a large-scale analysis of 32
attack papers published over two years. Using an automated pipeline, we extract
and compress adversarial skills into a sparse dictionary of primitives, with
LLMs generating human-readable descriptions. Our analysis reveals that unseen
attacks can be effectively explained as sparse compositions of earlier skills,
with explanatory power increasing monotonically as skill coverage grows. Guided
by this insight, we introduce Adversarial Skill Compositional Training (ASCoT),
which trains on diverse compositions of skill primitives rather than isolated
attack instances. ASCoT substantially improves robustness to unseen attacks,
including multi-turn jailbreaks, while maintaining low over-refusal rates. We
also demonstrate that expanding adversarial skill coverage, not just data
scale, is key to defending against novel attacks.

TL;DR: 提出一个混合整数规划框架，用于优化医疗风险评分工具，解决部分监督和不对称误分类成本问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 电子健康记录数据为优化风险评分工具提供了机会，但面临部分监督（仅极端类别可可靠标记）和不对称误分类成本（随序数距离增加）的挑战。

Method: 使用混合整数规划框架联合优化评分权重和类别阈值，通过每个实例的可行标签集处理部分监督，结合不对称距离感知目标，并通过最小阈值间隙防止中间类别崩溃。

Result: 开发了使用softplus损失的CSO松弛方法，保持序数结构的同时实现高效优化。

Conclusion: 该框架支持符号限制、稀疏性和对现有工具的最小修改等治理约束，确保在临床工作流程中的实际可部署性。

Abstract: Risk assessment tools in healthcare commonly employ point-based scoring
systems that map patients to ordinal risk categories via thresholds. While
electronic health record (EHR) data presents opportunities for data-driven
optimization of these tools, two fundamental challenges impede standard
supervised learning: (1) partial supervision arising from intervention-censored
outcomes, where only extreme categories can be reliably labeled, and (2)
asymmetric misclassification costs that increase with ordinal distance. We
propose a mixed-integer programming (MIP) framework that jointly optimizes
scoring weights and category thresholds under these constraints. Our approach
handles partial supervision through per-instance feasible label sets,
incorporates asymmetric distance-aware objectives, and prevents middle-category
collapse via minimum threshold gaps. We further develop a CSO relaxation using
softplus losses that preserves the ordinal structure while enabling efficient
optimization. The framework supports governance constraints including sign
restrictions, sparsity, and minimal modifications to incumbent tools, ensuring
practical deployability in clinical workflows.

Abstract: Novelty detection in large scientific datasets faces two key challenges: the
noisy and high-dimensional nature of experimental data, and the necessity of
making statistically robust statements about any observed outliers. While there
is a wealth of literature on anomaly detection via dimensionality reduction,
most methods do not produce outputs compatible with quantifiable claims of
scientific discovery. In this work we directly address these challenges,
presenting the first step towards a unified pipeline for novelty detection
adapted for the rigorous statistical demands of science. We introduce
AutoSciDACT (Automated Scientific Discovery with Anomalous Contrastive
Testing), a general-purpose pipeline for detecting novelty in scientific data.
AutoSciDACT begins by creating expressive low-dimensional data representations
using a contrastive pre-training, leveraging the abundance of high-quality
simulated data in many scientific domains alongside expertise that can guide
principled data augmentation strategies. These compact embeddings then enable
an extremely sensitive machine learning-based two-sample test using the New
Physics Learning Machine (NPLM) framework, which identifies and statistically
quantifies deviations in observed data relative to a reference distribution
(null hypothesis). We perform experiments across a range of astronomical,
physical, biological, image, and synthetic datasets, demonstrating strong
sensitivity to small injections of anomalous data across all domains.

TL;DR: 本文研究了神经网络中的瓶颈秩现象及其对泛化能力的影响，证明了利用权重矩阵近似低秩结构的泛化边界，该边界依赖于权重矩阵的Schatten p拟范数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 最近研究发现神经网络存在瓶颈秩特性：随着深度增加，基于梯度方法训练的神经网络激活和权重往往呈现近似低秩。本文旨在探索这一现象对泛化能力的影响。

Method: 通过分析权重矩阵的Schatten p拟范数来推导泛化边界，利用神经网络权重矩阵的近似低秩结构特性。

Result: 证明了依赖于权重矩阵Schatten p拟范数的泛化边界：当p较小时，样本复杂度为O(WrL^2)，其中W为宽度，L为深度，r为权重矩阵秩；随着p增大，边界行为更接近基于范数的边界。

Conclusion: 神经网络的瓶颈秩特性可以用于推导更紧致的泛化边界，Schatten p拟范数提供了一种统一框架来描述这种低秩结构对泛化的影响。

Abstract: It has been recently observed in much of the literature that neural networks
exhibit a bottleneck rank property: for larger depths, the activation and
weights of neural networks trained with gradient-based methods tend to be of
approximately low rank. In fact, the rank of the activations of each layer
converges to a fixed value referred to as the ``bottleneck rank'', which is the
minimum rank required to represent the training data. This perspective is in
line with the observation that regularizing linear networks (without
activations) with weight decay is equivalent to minimizing the Schatten $p$
quasi norm of the neural network. In this paper we investigate the implications
of this phenomenon for generalization. More specifically, we prove
generalization bounds for neural networks which exploit the approximate low
rank structure of the weight matrices if present. The final results rely on the
Schatten $p$ quasi norms of the weight matrices: for small $p$, the bounds
exhibit a sample complexity $ \widetilde{O}(WrL^2)$ where $W$ and $L$ are the
width and depth of the neural network respectively and where $r$ is the rank of
the weight matrices. As $p$ increases, the bound behaves more like a norm-based
bound instead.

Abstract: Spectral decomposition of linear operators plays a central role in many areas
of machine learning and scientific computing. Recent work has explored training
neural networks to approximate eigenfunctions of such operators, enabling
scalable approaches to representation learning, dynamical systems, and partial
differential equations (PDEs). In this paper, we revisit a classical
optimization framework from the computational physics literature known as the
\emph{orbital minimization method} (OMM), originally proposed in the 1990s for
solving eigenvalue problems in computational chemistry. We provide a simple
linear-algebraic proof of the consistency of the OMM objective, and reveal
connections between this method and several ideas that have appeared
independently across different domains. Our primary goal is to justify its
broader applicability in modern learning pipelines. We adapt this framework to
train neural networks to decompose positive semidefinite operators, and
demonstrate its practical advantages across a range of benchmark tasks. Our
results highlight how revisiting classical numerical methods through the lens
of modern theory and computation can provide not only a principled approach for
deploying neural networks in numerical simulation, but also effective and
scalable tools for machine learning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer中的常规注意力机制计算复杂度为O(N²D)，而线性注意力虽然理论上有O(ND²)的线性复杂度，但在实践中效率落后于理论预期。

Method: 开发了线性注意力的新型前向和后向传播算法，并实现了高度优化的CUDA实现。

Result: 在单层和端到端设置中验证，速度比现有技术快3.3倍，内存消耗减少3.6倍，14亿参数语言模型在主要推理基准测试中表现出与常规注意力相似的表达能力。

Conclusion: 提出的方法显著提升了线性注意力的实际效率，使其在保持表达能力的同时实现了更好的运行时性能。

Abstract: The original softmax-based attention mechanism (regular attention) in the
extremely successful Transformer architecture computes attention between $N$
tokens, each embedded in a $D$-dimensional head, with a time complexity of
$O(N^2D)$. Given the success of Transformers, improving their runtime during
both training and inference is a popular research area. One such approach is
the introduction of the linear attention (LA) mechanisms, which offers a linear
time complexity of $O(ND^2)$ and have demonstrated comparable accuracy to
regular attention. However, LA in practice lags behind its theoretical
efficiency. We propose a novel method for LA's forward and backward passes,
along with a highly-optimized CUDA implementation. Our approach outperforms the
state-of-the-art by 3.3 times in speed and reduces memory consumption by 3.6
times. We validate these improvements in both single-layer and end-to-end
settings by training a 1.4 billion parameter language model, which demonstrates
similar expressivity to regular attention on major reasoning benchmarks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PUNT是一种模型无关的采样器，通过识别token依赖关系并移除低置信度token来解决并行采样中的条件独立性和高置信度预测之间的冲突，在保持准确性的同时提高计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 掩码扩散模型(MDMs)相比自回归模型(ARMs)具有并行采样的优势，但并行采样面临两个冲突要求：同时更新的token必须条件独立，而更新应优先考虑高置信度预测。高置信度预测往往相互依赖，限制了并行更新的机会。

Method: PUNT通过识别token依赖关系，从冲突组中移除低置信度token，生成满足独立性和置信度标准的索引集，通过近似条件独立性测试实现改进的并行解掩码。

Result: 在IFEval基准测试中，PUNT比基线方法（包括顺序生成）准确率提高达16%，在生成长序列时表现更优，且对超参数不敏感，无需脆弱的超参数调优。

Conclusion: PUNT在准确性和计算效率之间实现了优越的权衡，并诱导出层次化生成策略，模型先建立高级段落结构再进行局部细化，这种类似规划的过程有助于提升对齐性能。

Abstract: Masked diffusion models (MDMs) offer a compelling alternative to
autoregressive models (ARMs) for discrete text generation because they enable
parallel token sampling, rather than sequential, left-to-right generation. This
means potentially much faster inference. However, effective parallel sampling
faces two competing requirements: (i) simultaneously updated tokens must be
conditionally independent, and (ii) updates should prioritise high-confidence
predictions. These goals conflict because high-confidence predictions often
cluster and depend on each other, opportunities for parallel updates.
  We present PUNT, a model-agnostic sampler that reconciles this trade-off. Our
method identifies token dependencies and removes lower-confidence tokens from
conflicting groups. This produces sets of indices for unmasking that satisfy
both independence and confidence criteria. Our approach ensures improved
parallel unmasking through approximate conditional independence testing.
  Our experiments show that PUNT delivers a superior trade-off between accuracy
and compute when compared to other strong training-free baselines, especially
for generation of longer sequences. On the IFEval benchmark, it achieves up to
16\% higher accuracy over baseline methods, including sequential generation
(one-by-one). These gains hold across different values of hyperparameters,
mitigating the need for brittle hyperparameter tuning. Moreover, we observe
that PUNT induces an emergent hierarchical generation strategy, where the model
first establishes high-level paragraph structure before local refinement,
suggesting a planning-like generation process that contributes to strong
alignment performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统Jump Gaussian Processes在高维输入空间中存在局限性，需要一种能够有效处理高维分段连续函数的方法。

Method: 添加局部线性投影层，使用区域特定矩阵捕捉局部子空间结构，在投影输入上应用JGP来捕捉分段连续关系，并开发可扩展的变分推断算法。

Result: 在合成和基准数据集上的实验表明，DJGP相比现有方法具有更优越的预测精度和更可靠的uncertainty量化。

Conclusion: DJGP通过两层的深度GP/JGP学习，成功解决了高维分段连续函数的建模问题，提供了更好的预测性能和uncertainty估计。

Abstract: We introduce Deep Jump Gaussian Processes (DJGP), a novel method for
surrogate modeling of high-dimensional piecewise continuous functions. DJGP
overcomes the limitations of conventional Jump Gaussian Processes in
high-dimensional input spaces by adding a locally linear projection layer to
Jump Gaussian Processes. This projection uses region-specific matrices to
capture local subspace structures, naturally complementing the localized nature
of JGP, a variant of local Gaussian Processes. To control model complexity, we
place a Gaussian Process prior on the projection matrices, allowing them to
evolve smoothly across the input space. The projected inputs are then modeled
with a JGP to capture piecewise continuous relationships with the response.
This yields a distinctive two-layer deep learning of GP/JGP. We further develop
a scalable variational inference algorithm to jointly learn the projection
matrices and JGP hyperparameters. Experiments on synthetic and benchmark
datasets demonstrate that DJGP delivers superior predictive accuracy and more
reliable uncertainty quantification compared to existing approaches.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RLVR训练虽然提升了推理能力，但会导致模型基础能力退化，如感知和忠实性下降。现有正则化方法无法保证广泛知识保护，经验回放难以平衡不同目标。

Method: 提出RECAP方法，使用动态目标重加权的回放策略，基于收敛和不稳定性信号在线调整训练焦点，从饱和目标转向表现不佳或波动的目标。

Result: 在Qwen2.5-VL-3B和Qwen2.5-VL-7B上的实验表明，该方法有效保护通用能力，同时通过更灵活的任务奖励权衡提升推理能力。

Conclusion: RECAP是端到端的方法，无需额外模型训练或大量调参，可直接应用于现有RLVR流程，有效解决能力退化问题。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has delivered
impressive gains in mathematical and multimodal reasoning and has become a
standard post-training paradigm for contemporary language and vision-language
models. However, the RLVR recipe introduces a significant risk of capability
regression, where models forget foundational skills after prolonged training
without employing regularization strategies. We empirically confirm this
concern, observing that open-source reasoning models suffer performance
degradation on core capabilities such as perception and faithfulness. While
imposing regularization terms like KL divergence can help prevent deviation
from the base model, these terms are calculated on the current task, thus they
do not guarantee broader knowledge. Meanwhile, commonly used experience replay
across heterogeneous domains makes it nontrivial to decide how much training
focus each objective should receive. To address this, we propose RECAP-a replay
strategy with dynamic objective reweighting for general knowledge preservation.
Our reweighting mechanism adapts in an online manner using short-horizon
signals of convergence and instability, shifting the post-training focus away
from saturated objectives and toward underperforming or volatile ones. Our
method is end-to-end and readily applicable to existing RLVR pipelines without
training additional models or heavy tuning. Extensive experiments on benchmarks
based on Qwen2.5-VL-3B and Qwen2.5-VL-7B demonstrate the effectiveness of our
method, which not only preserves general capabilities but also improves
reasoning by enabling more flexible trade-offs among in-task rewards.

Conclusion: 这种基于图集合的嵌入方法有助于识别低丰度的适体候选物进行进一步实验评估，为存在观测偏差的生化数据分析提供了新思路。

Abstract: Machine-learning methods in biochemistry commonly represent molecules as
graphs of pairwise intermolecular interactions for property and structure
predictions. Most methods operate on a single graph, typically the minimal free
energy (MFE) structure, for low-energy ensembles (conformations) representative
of structures at thermodynamic equilibrium. We introduce a thermodynamically
parameterized exponential-family random graph (ERGM) embedding that models
molecules as Boltzmann-weighted ensembles of interaction graphs. We evaluate
this embedding on SELEX datasets, where experimental biases (e.g., PCR
amplification or sequencing noise) can obscure true aptamer-ligand affinity,
producing anomalous candidates whose observed abundance diverges from their
actual binding strength. We show that the proposed embedding enables robust
community detection and subgraph-level explanations for aptamer ligand
affinity, even in the presence of biased observations. This approach may be
used to identify low-abundance aptamer candidates for further experimental
evaluation.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) promises to solve long-horizon tasks even when
training data contains only short fragments of the behaviors. This experience
stitching capability is often viewed as the purview of temporal difference (TD)
methods. However, outside of small tabular settings, trajectories never
intersect, calling into question this conventional wisdom. Moreover, the common
belief is that Monte Carlo (MC) methods should not be able to recombine
experience, yet it remains unclear whether function approximation could result
in a form of implicit stitching. The goal of this paper is to empirically study
whether the conventional wisdom about stitching actually holds in settings
where function approximation is used. We empirically demonstrate that Monte
Carlo (MC) methods can also achieve experience stitching. While TD methods do
achieve slightly stronger capabilities than MC methods (in line with
conventional wisdom), that gap is significantly smaller than the gap between
small and large neural networks (even on quite simple tasks). We find that
increasing critic capacity effectively reduces the generalization gap for both
the MC and TD methods. These results suggest that the traditional TD inductive
bias for stitching may be less necessary in the era of large models for RL and,
in some cases, may offer diminishing returns. Additionally, our results suggest
that stitching, a form of generalization unique to the RL setting, might be
achieved not through specialized algorithms (temporal difference learning) but
rather through the same recipe that has provided generalization in other
machine learning settings (via scale). Project website:

Conclusion: 实验证实了理论发现，表明可以通过特定设计使模型具有因果可解释性，但需要在可解释性和预测准确性之间进行权衡。

Abstract: Understanding the predictions made by deep learning models remains a central
challenge, especially in high-stakes applications. A promising approach is to
equip models with the ability to answer counterfactual questions --
hypothetical ``what if?'' scenarios that go beyond the observed data and
provide insight into a model reasoning. In this work, we introduce the notion
of causal interpretability, which formalizes when counterfactual queries can be
evaluated from a specific class of models and observational data. We analyze
two common model classes -- blackbox and concept-based predictors -- and show
that neither is causally interpretable in general. To address this gap, we
develop a framework for building models that are causally interpretable by
design. Specifically, we derive a complete graphical criterion that determines
whether a given model architecture supports a given counterfactual query. This
leads to a fundamental tradeoff between causal interpretability and predictive
accuracy, which we characterize by identifying the unique maximal set of
features that yields an interpretable model with maximal predictive
expressiveness. Experiments corroborate the theoretical findings.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个统计框架来解决文本水印检测中因重复文本导致的伪随机性不完美问题，通过分层双分区和最小单元概念，改进了检测性能并确保严格的I类错误控制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本水印方法假设完美的伪随机性，但在实践中，生成文本中的重复会导致碰撞和结构化依赖，损害I类错误控制并使标准分析无效。

Method: 引入统计框架，通过分层双分区捕获结构依赖，核心是最小单元概念——跨单元可视为独立但允许单元内依赖的最小群组。使用最小单元定义非渐近效率度量，将水印检测建模为极小极大假设检验问题。

Result: 应用于Gumbel-max和逆变换水印，框架产生闭式最优规则。理论表明丢弃重复统计量通常能提高性能，且除非退化否则必须处理单元内依赖。理论和实验都证实了在严格I类错误控制下检测能力的提升。

Conclusion: 该研究为不完美伪随机性下的水印检测提供了首个原则性基础，为模型输出的可靠追踪提供了理论洞见和实践指导。

Abstract: Text watermarking plays a crucial role in ensuring the traceability and
accountability of large language model (LLM) outputs and mitigating misuse.
While promising, most existing methods assume perfect pseudorandomness. In
practice, repetition in generated text induces collisions that create
structured dependence, compromising Type I error control and invalidating
standard analyses.
  We introduce a statistical framework that captures this structure through a
hierarchical two-layer partition. At its core is the concept of minimal units
-- the smallest groups treatable as independent across units while permitting
dependence within. Using minimal units, we define a non-asymptotic efficiency
measure and cast watermark detection as a minimax hypothesis testing problem.
  Applied to Gumbel-max and inverse-transform watermarks, our framework
produces closed-form optimal rules. It explains why discarding repeated
statistics often improves performance and shows that within-unit dependence
must be addressed unless degenerate. Both theory and experiments confirm
improved detection power with rigorous Type I error control. These results
provide the first principled foundation for watermark detection under imperfect
pseudorandomness, offering both theoretical insight and practical guidance for
reliable tracing of model outputs.

Abstract: Computationally predicting protein-protein interactions (PPIs) is challenging
due to the lack of integrated, multimodal protein representations. DPEB is a
curated collection of 22,043 human proteins that integrates four embedding
types: structural (AlphaFold2), transformer-based sequence (BioEmbeddings),
contextual amino acid patterns (ESM-2: Evolutionary Scale Modeling), and
sequence-based n-gram statistics (ProtVec]). AlphaFold2 protein structures are
available through public databases (e.g., AlphaFold2 Protein Structure
Database), but the internal neural network embeddings are not. DPEB addresses
this gap by providing AlphaFold2-derived embeddings for computational modeling.
Our benchmark evaluations show GraphSAGE with BioEmbedding achieved the highest
PPI prediction performance (87.37% AUROC, 79.16% accuracy). The framework also
achieved 77.42% accuracy for enzyme classification and 86.04% accuracy for
protein family classification. DPEB supports multiple graph neural network
methods for PPI prediction, enabling applications in systems biology, drug
target identification, pathway analysis, and disease mechanism studies.

TL;DR: 提出了加权准确率作为二元分类器的评估指标，与最小化总分类成本目标一致，为处理类别不平衡问题提供了替代重采样技术的概念框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 分类器评估指标选择缺乏共识，且对数据集不平衡处理存在误解。分类器优化的最终目标通常是最大化投资回报或最小化总分类成本。

Method: 定义加权准确率作为评估指标，建立与总分类成本最小化一致的概念框架，提出在缺乏完全指定误分类成本时估计权重参数的程序。

Result: 加权准确率与总分类成本在示例依赖场景中具有强相关性，证明了该指标的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 加权准确率提供了一个与成本敏感分类目标一致的有效评估框架，明确了在哪些场景下使用重采样技术是合适或适得其反的。

Abstract: Selecting an appropriate evaluation metric for classifiers is crucial for
model comparison and parameter optimization, yet there is not consensus on a
universally accepted metric that serves as a definitive standard. Moreover,
there is often a misconception about the perceived need to mitigate imbalance
in datasets used to train classification models. Since the final goal in
classifier optimization is typically maximizing the return of investment or,
equivalently, minimizing the Total Classification Cost (TCC), we define
Weighted Accuracy (WA), an evaluation metric for binary classifiers with a
straightforward interpretation as a weighted version of the well-known accuracy
metric, coherent with the need of minimizing TCC. We clarify the conceptual
framework for handling class imbalance in cost-sensitive scenarios, providing
an alternative to rebalancing techniques. This framework can be applied to any
metric that, like WA, can be expressed as a linear combination of
example-dependent quantities and allows for comparing the results obtained in
different datasets and for addressing discrepancies between the development
dataset, used to train and validate the model, and the target dataset, where
the model will be deployed. It also specifies in which scenarios using
UCCs-unaware class rebalancing techniques or rebalancing metrics aligns with
TCC minimization and when it is instead counterproductive. Finally, we propose
a procedure to estimate the WA weight parameter in the absence of fully
specified UCCs and demonstrate the robustness of WA by analyzing its
correlation with TCC in example-dependent scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有强化学习政策设计假设公民会遵循政策，但现实中缺乏制度信任时公民不会配合。需要开发考虑信任因素的算法。

Method: 使用深度确定性策略梯度方法学习资源分配策略，模拟资源分配过程并建模社区成员制度信任变化，研究信任纳入对结果的影响。

Result: 纳入信任的强化学习算法能产生更成功的政策，保守的信任估计能提高公平性和社区平均信任，但会降低组织成功率。配额系统干预可改善公平和信任。

Conclusion: 制度信任在算法设计中至关重要，组织成功与社区福祉之间存在张力，需要在两者间寻求平衡。

Abstract: Many governmental bodies are adopting AI policies for decision-making. In
particular, Reinforcement Learning has been used to design policies that
citizens would be expected to follow if implemented. Much RL work assumes that
citizens follow these policies, and evaluate them with this in mind. However,
we know from prior work that without institutional trust, citizens will not
follow policies put in place by governments. In this work, we develop a
trust-aware RL algorithm for resource allocation in communities. We consider
the case of humanitarian engineering, where the organization is aiming to
distribute some technology or resource to community members. We use a Deep
Deterministic Policy Gradient approach to learn a resource allocation that fits
the needs of the organization. Then, we simulate resource allocation according
to the learned policy, and model the changes in institutional trust of
community members. We investigate how this incorporation of institutional trust
affects outcomes, and ask how effectively an organization can learn policies if
trust values are private. We find that incorporating trust into RL algorithms
can lead to more successful policies, specifically when the organization's
goals are less certain. We find more conservative trust estimates lead to
increased fairness and average community trust, though organization success
suffers. Finally, we explore a strategy to prevent unfair outcomes to
communities. We implement a quota system by an external entity which decreases
the organization's utility when it does not serve enough community members. We
find this intervention can improve fairness and trust among communities in some
cases, while decreasing the success of the organization. This work underscores
the importance of institutional trust in algorithm design and implementation,
and identifies a tension between organization success and community well-being.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: K-DAREK是一种基于KKAN架构的新型学习算法，通过距离感知误差边界实现高效、可解释的函数逼近和不确定性量化，在安全控制任务中展现出比Ensemble KANs快4倍、比GP扩展性高8.6倍、比DAREK安全50%的优越性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 神经网络和Gaussian过程在函数逼近中各有限制：神经网络架构选择影响可解释性和泛化能力，而GP在大规模问题上计算成本高昂。KKANs通过减少样条层并使用Chebyshev层和MLPs，提供了更稳定的收敛性能。

Method: 提出K-DAREK算法，基于增强的KKAN架构，建立距离感知的鲁棒误差边界，反映测试点与最近训练点的接近程度。

Result: 在安全控制任务中，K-DAREK比Ensemble of KANs快4倍、计算效率高10倍，比GP扩展性高8.6倍，比DAREK安全50%。

Conclusion: K-DAREK为动态系统中的算子估计和系统建模提供了一种高效、可解释且具有不确定性量化的强大架构。

Abstract: Neural networks are parametric and powerful tools for function approximation,
and the choice of architecture heavily influences their interpretability,
efficiency, and generalization. In contrast, Gaussian processes (GPs) are
nonparametric probabilistic models that define distributions over functions
using a kernel to capture correlations among data points. However, these models
become computationally expensive for large-scale problems, as they require
inverting a large covariance matrix. Kolmogorov- Arnold networks (KANs),
semi-parametric neural architectures, have emerged as a prominent approach for
modeling complex functions with structured and efficient representations
through spline layers. Kurkova Kolmogorov-Arnold networks (KKANs) extend this
idea by reducing the number of spline layers in KAN and replacing them with
Chebyshev layers and multi-layer perceptrons, thereby mapping inputs into
higher-dimensional spaces before applying spline-based transformations.
Compared to KANs, KKANs perform more stable convergence during training, making
them a strong architecture for estimating operators and system modeling in
dynamical systems. By enhancing the KKAN architecture, we develop a novel
learning algorithm, distance-aware error for Kurkova-Kolmogorov networks
(K-DAREK), for efficient and interpretable function approximation with
uncertainty quantification. Our approach establishes robust error bounds that
are distance-aware; this means they reflect the proximity of a test point to
its nearest training points. Through case studies on a safe control task, we
demonstrate that K-DAREK is about four times faster and ten times higher
computationally efficiency than Ensemble of KANs, 8.6 times more scalable than
GP by increasing the data size, and 50% safer than our previous work
distance-aware error for Kolmogorov networks (DAREK).

Method: 将token表示演化建模为球面上的相互作用粒子系统，分析归一化方案作为速度调节器的作用，统一分析多种归一化方案（Post-LN、Pre-LN、Mix-LN、Peri-LN、nGPT、LN-Scaling）。

Result: 归一化方案影响token表示的聚类动态和表示崩溃现象，不同方案在调节token演化速度方面表现不同，Peri-LN被识别为特别有效的选择。

Conclusion: 该框架为比较不同归一化方案提供了理论基础，阐明了它们如何塑造各层的token表示，并确认Peri-LN是一种特别有效的归一化方案。

Abstract: We study the effect of normalization schemes on token representations in deep
transformers. Modeling their evolution as interacting particles on the sphere,
we show that normalization acts as a form of speed regulation. This perspective
enables a unified analysis of several schemes -- including Post-LN, Pre-LN,
Mix-LN, Peri-LN, nGPT, and LN-Scaling -- revealing how they influence
clustering dynamics and representation collapse. Our framework clarifies how
different schemes shape token representations across layers and provides a
principled basis for comparing them, identifying Peri-LN as a particularly
effective choice.

Abstract: We study the problem of Offline Safe Reinforcement Learning (OSRL), where the
goal is to learn a reward-maximizing policy from fixed data under a cumulative
cost constraint. We propose a novel OSRL approach that frames the problem as a
minimax objective and solves it by combining offline RL with online
optimization algorithms. We prove the approximate optimality of this approach
when integrated with an approximate offline RL oracle and no-regret online
optimization. We also present a practical approximation that can be combined
with any offline RL algorithm, eliminating the need for offline policy
evaluation. Empirical results on the DSRL benchmark demonstrate that our method
reliably enforces safety constraints under stringent cost budgets, while
achieving high rewards. The code is available at

Abstract: Causal discovery from observational data is a fundamental task in artificial
intelligence, with far-reaching implications for decision-making, predictions,
and interventions. Despite significant advances, existing methods can be
broadly categorized as constraint-based or score-based approaches.
Constraint-based methods offer rigorous causal discovery but are often hindered
by small sample sizes, while score-based methods provide flexible optimization
but typically forgo explicit conditional independence testing. This work
explores a third avenue: developing differentiable $d$-separation scores,
obtained through a percolation theory using soft logic. This enables the
implementation of a new type of causal discovery method: gradient-based
optimization of conditional independence constraints. Empirical evaluations
demonstrate the robust performance of our approach in low-sample regimes,
surpassing traditional constraint-based and score-based baselines on a
real-world dataset. Code and data of the proposed method are publicly available
at https://github$.$com/PurdueMINDS/DAGPA.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了线性最优传输（LOT）框架，将单细胞技术生成的高维点云嵌入到固定维度的欧几里得空间中，同时保持分布结构，解决了患者间生物差异难以直接量化和比较的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 单细胞技术产生的高维点云数据难以直接比较患者间的生物差异，非线性方法虽然预测准确但缺乏可解释性。需要一种既能保持预测性能又能提供生物学解释的方法。

Method: 采用线性最优传输（LOT）框架，将不规则点云嵌入到固定维度的欧几里得空间，保持最优传输几何结构，并形成患者间的配准。

Result: LOT实现了：1）准确且可解释的COVID-19患者状态分类，分类器权重可映射回特定标记和空间区域；2）患者来源类器官的合成数据生成，利用LOT嵌入的线性特性生成平均细胞谱。

Conclusion: LOT作为一个统一框架，在预测性能、可解释性和生成建模之间架起桥梁，通过将异质点云转换为可直接追溯原始数据的结构化嵌入，为理解高维生物系统中的免疫变异和治疗效果开辟了新机会。

Abstract: Single-cell technologies generate high-dimensional point clouds of cells,
enabling detailed characterization of complex patient states and treatment
responses. Yet each patient is represented by an irregular point cloud rather
than a simple vector, making it difficult to directly quantify and compare
biological differences between individuals. Nonlinear methods such as kernels
and neural networks achieve predictive accuracy but act as black boxes,
offering little biological interpretability.
  To address these limitations, we adapt the Linear Optimal Transport (LOT)
framework to this setting, embedding irregular point clouds into a
fixed-dimensional Euclidean space while preserving distributional structure.
This embedding provides a principled linear representation that preserves
optimal transport geometry while enabling downstream analysis. It also forms a
registration between any two patients, enabling direct comparison of their
cellular distributions. Within this space, LOT enables: (i) \textbf{accurate
and interpretable classification} of COVID-19 patient states, where classifier
weights map back to specific markers and spatial regions driving predictions;
and (ii) \textbf{synthetic data generation} for patient-derived organoids,
exploiting the linearity of the LOT embedding. LOT barycenters yield averaged
cellular profiles representing combined conditions or samples, supporting drug
interaction testing.
  Together, these results establish LOT as a unified framework that bridges
predictive performance, interpretability, and generative modeling. By
transforming heterogeneous point clouds into structured embeddings directly
traceable to the original data, LOT opens new opportunities for understanding
immune variation and treatment effects in high-dimensional biological systems.

Abstract: The classic Mallows model is a foundational tool for modeling user
preferences. However, it has limitations in capturing real-world scenarios,
where users often focus only on a limited set of preferred items and are
indifferent to the rest. To address this, extensions such as the top-k Mallows
model have been proposed, aligning better with practical applications. In this
paper, we address several challenges related to the generalized top-k Mallows
model, with a focus on analyzing buyer choices. Our key contributions are: (1)
a novel sampling scheme tailored to generalized top-k Mallows models, (2) an
efficient algorithm for computing choice probabilities under this model, and
(3) an active learning algorithm for estimating the model parameters from
observed choice data. These contributions provide new tools for analysis and
prediction in critical decision-making scenarios. We present a rigorous
mathematical analysis for the performance of our algorithms. Furthermore,
through extensive experiments on synthetic data and real-world data, we
demonstrate the scalability and accuracy of our proposed methods, and we
compare the predictive power of Mallows model for top-k lists compared to the
simpler Multinomial Logit model.

Abstract: Sampling from constrained statistical distributions is a fundamental task in
various fields including Bayesian statistics, computational chemistry, and
statistical physics. This article considers the cases where the constrained
distribution is described by an unconstrained density, as well as additional
equality and/or inequality constraints, which often make the constraint set
nonconvex. Existing methods for nonconvex constraint set $\Sigma \subset
\mathbb{R}^d$ defined by equality or inequality constraints commonly rely on
costly projection steps. Moreover, they cannot handle equality and inequality
constraints simultaneously as each method only specialized in one case. In
addition, rigorous and quantitative convergence guarantee is often lacking. In
this paper, we introduce Overdamped Langevin with LAnding (OLLA), a new
framework that can design overdamped Langevin dynamics accommodating both
equality and inequality constraints. The proposed dynamics also
deterministically corrects trajectories along the normal direction of the
constraint surface, thus obviating the need for explicit projections. We show
that, under suitable regularity conditions on the target density and $\Sigma$,
OLLA converges exponentially fast in $W_2$ distance to the constrained target
density $\rho_\Sigma(x) \propto \exp(-f(x))d\sigma_\Sigma$. Lastly, through
experiments, we demonstrate the efficiency of OLLA compared to projection-based
constrained Langevin algorithms and their slack variable variants, highlighting
its favorable computational cost and reasonable empirical mixing.

Abstract: Power flow (PF) calculations are the backbone of real-time grid operations,
across workflows such as contingency analysis (where repeated PF evaluations
assess grid security under outages) and topology optimization (which involves
PF-based searches over combinatorially large action spaces). Running these
calculations at operational timescales or across large evaluation spaces
remains a major computational bottleneck. Additionally, growing uncertainty in
power system operations from the integration of renewables and climate-induced
extreme weather also calls for tools that can accurately and efficiently
simulate a wide range of scenarios and operating conditions. Machine learning
methods offer a potential speedup over traditional solvers, but their
performance has not been systematically assessed on benchmarks that capture
real-world variability. This paper introduces PF$\Delta$, a benchmark dataset
for power flow that captures diverse variations in load, generation, and
topology. PF$\Delta$ contains 859,800 solved power flow instances spanning six
different bus system sizes, capturing three types of contingency scenarios (N ,
N -1, and N -2), and including close-to-infeasible cases near steady-state
voltage stability limits. We evaluate traditional solvers and GNN-based
methods, highlighting key areas where existing approaches struggle, and
identifying open problems for future research. Our dataset is available at

Abstract: With the rise of online and virtual learning, monitoring and enhancing
student engagement have become an important aspect of effective education.
Traditional methods of assessing a student's involvement might not be
applicable directly to virtual environments. In this study, we focused on this
problem and addressed the need to develop an automated system to detect student
engagement levels during online learning. We proposed a novel training method
which can discourage a model from leveraging sensitive features like gender for
its predictions. The proposed method offers benefits not only in the
enforcement of ethical standards, but also to enhance interpretability of the
model predictions. We applied an attribute-orthogonal regularization technique
to a split-model classifier, which uses multiple transfer learning strategies
to achieve effective results in reducing disparity in the distribution of
prediction for sensitivity groups from a Pearson correlation coefficient of
0.897 for the unmitigated model, to 0.999 for the mitigated model. The source

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) are known to operate with high accuracy on
learning from graph-structured data, but they suffer from high computational
and resource costs. Neural network compression methods are used to reduce the
model size while maintaining reasonable accuracy. Two of the common neural
network compression techniques include pruning and quantization. In this
research, we empirically examine the effects of three pruning methods and three
quantization methods on different GNN models, including graph classification
tasks, node classification tasks, and link prediction. We conducted all
experiments on three graph datasets, including Cora, Proteins, and BBBP. Our
findings demonstrate that unstructured fine-grained and global pruning can
significantly reduce the model's size(50\%) while maintaining or even improving
precision after fine-tuning the pruned model. The evaluation of different
quantization methods on GNN shows diverse impacts on accuracy, inference time,
and model size across different datasets.

Conclusion: DGPFM方法成功解决了函数空间映射学习中的非线性建模和不确定性量化问题，在多个数据集上表现出色。

Abstract: Learning mappings between functional spaces, also known as
function-on-function regression, plays a crucial role in functional data
analysis and has broad applications, e.g. spatiotemporal forecasting, curve
prediction, and climate modeling. Existing approaches, such as functional
linear models and neural operators, either fall short of capturing complex
nonlinearities or lack reliable uncertainty quantification under noisy, sparse,
and irregularly sampled data. To address these issues, we propose Deep Gaussian
Processes for Functional Maps (DGPFM). Our method designs a sequence of
GP-based linear and nonlinear transformations, leveraging integral transforms
of kernels, GP interpolation, and nonlinear activations sampled from GPs. A key
insight simplifies implementation: under fixed locations, discrete
approximations of kernel integral transforms collapse into direct functional
integral transforms, enabling flexible incorporation of various integral
transform designs. To achieve scalable probabilistic inference, we use inducing
points and whitening transformations to develop a variational learning
algorithm. Empirical results on real-world and PDE benchmark datasets
demonstrate that the advantage of DGPFM in both predictive performance and
uncertainty calibration.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于多动作RMABs的神经索引策略，通过神经网络学习臂-动作对的预算感知索引，并使用可微背包层进行约束优化，实现端到端训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RMABs假设二元动作和单一全局预算，但现实场景如医疗保健涉及多种干预措施和异构成本约束，需要更通用的框架。

Method: 使用神经网络学习臂-动作对的索引，通过熵正则化最优传输问题构建可微背包层，将索引预测和约束优化统一在端到端可微框架中。

Result: NIP在严格执行异构预算约束的同时，实现了接近最优的性能（与oracle策略相差5%以内），并能扩展到数百个臂。

Conclusion: 该工作为复杂资源受限环境中的索引策略学习建立了一个通用、理论基础扎实且可扩展的框架。

Abstract: Restless multi-armed bandits (RMABs) provide a scalable framework for
sequential decision-making under uncertainty, but classical formulations assume
binary actions and a single global budget. Real-world settings, such as
healthcare, often involve multiple interventions with heterogeneous costs and
constraints, where such assumptions break down. We introduce a Neural Index
Policy (NIP) for multi-action RMABs with heterogeneous budget constraints. Our
approach learns to assign budget-aware indices to arm--action pairs using a
neural network, and converts them into feasible allocations via a
differentiable knapsack layer formulated as an entropy-regularized optimal
transport (OT) problem. The resulting model unifies index prediction and
constrained optimization in a single end-to-end differentiable framework,
enabling gradient-based training directly on decision quality. The network is
optimized to align its induced occupancy measure with the theoretical upper
bound from a linear programming relaxation, bridging asymptotic RMAB theory
with practical learning. Empirically, NIP achieves near-optimal performance
within 5% of the oracle occupancy-measure policy while strictly enforcing
heterogeneous budgets and scaling to hundreds of arms. This work establishes a
general, theoretically grounded, and scalable framework for learning
index-based policies in complex resource-constrained environments.

TL;DR: MAGIC-Flow是一个条件多尺度归一化流架构，在单一模块化框架中同时执行生成和分类任务，特别适用于医学成像等数据有限领域。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成建模在表示学习方面很强大，但在医学成像等挑战性领域直接应用有限：没有任务对齐的单纯生成无法为临床使用提供坚实基础。

Method: 构建为可逆和可微分双射的层次结构，其中雅可比行列式在子变换间分解，支持精确似然计算和稳定优化，通过条件化类标签实现可控样本合成和原则性类概率估计。

Result: 在多个数据集上评估显示，MAGIC-Flow创建了真实多样的样本并改进了分类性能，能够处理扫描仪噪声下的生成和分类，以及模态特定的合成和识别。

Conclusion: MAGIC-Flow是数据有限领域中生成和分类的有效策略，对隐私保护增强、鲁棒泛化和可信赖医疗AI具有直接益处。

Abstract: Generative modeling has emerged as a powerful paradigm for representation
learning, but its direct applicability to challenging fields like medical
imaging remains limited: mere generation, without task alignment, fails to
provide a robust foundation for clinical use. We propose MAGIC-Flow, a
conditional multiscale normalizing flow architecture that performs generation
and classification within a single modular framework. The model is built as a
hierarchy of invertible and differentiable bijections, where the Jacobian
determinant factorizes across sub-transformations. We show how this ensures
exact likelihood computation and stable optimization, while invertibility
enables explicit visualization of sample likelihoods, providing an
interpretable lens into the model's reasoning. By conditioning on class labels,
MAGIC-Flow supports controllable sample synthesis and principled
class-probability estimation, effectively aiding both generative and
discriminative objectives. We evaluate MAGIC-Flow against top baselines using
metrics for similarity, fidelity, and diversity. Across multiple datasets, it
addresses generation and classification under scanner noise, and
modality-specific synthesis and identification. Results show MAGIC-Flow creates
realistic, diverse samples and improves classification. MAGIC-Flow is an
effective strategy for generation and classification in data-limited domains,
with direct benefits for privacy-preserving augmentation, robust
generalization, and trustworthy medical AI.

Motivation: 解决在真实代码仓库中训练可靠代码修复代理的挑战，复杂构建和依赖变化导致评估不稳定。

Method: 开发可验证的构建验证流程，固定依赖并禁用自动升级；构建简化的大规模RL环境；对Qwen3-32B进行监督微调，并在简化环境中应用强化学习。

Result: 从GPT-4.1轨迹蒸馏的SFT模型性能相当但模型大小缩小56倍；RL在匹配训练测试条件下带来7-20%绝对提升；但SFT和RL模型在环境间泛化失败。

Conclusion: 训练测试环境匹配对于构建可靠的现实世界代码修复代理至关重要；思考模式在实验中表现一般或更差。

Abstract: We tackle the challenge of training reliable code-fixing agents in real
repositories, where complex builds and shifting dependencies make evaluation
unstable. We developed a verifiable pipeline with success defined as post-fix
build validation and improved reproducibility across ~1K real issues by pinning
dependencies and disabling automatic upgrades. Building on this, we introduced
a scalable simplified pipeline for large-scale reinforcement learning (RL).
Using this setup, we supervised fine-tuned Qwen3-32B in the full pipeline and
applied RL on top of the SFT model in the simplified environment. The SFT model
distilled from GPT-4.1 trajectories performs on par while being 56x smaller,
and RL added 7-20% absolute gains under matched train-test conditions.
"Thinking mode" was on par or worse in our experiments. Both SFT and RL models
failed to generalize across environments, highlighting the importance of
matching train-test environments for building reliable real-world code-fixing
agents.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了HiFlowCast和HiAntFlow两种层次图神经网络，通过潜在记忆保留机制和多尺度物理集成，显著提升了长期天气预报的准确性，特别是在极端事件预测方面。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统固定分辨率方法无法捕捉气候变化的多尺度物理过程，而现有层次图神经网络在向下映射时会丢失全局趋势，削弱了物理约束在预测中的作用。

Method: 设计潜在记忆保留机制来保持向下遍历时的全局趋势，以及潜在到物理分支来集成不同尺度的PDE解场，构建多尺度预测框架。

Conclusion: 该方法不仅提升了预测精度，还通过预训练权重实现单轮收敛，大幅降低了训练成本和碳足迹，对可持续AI发展具有重要意义。

Abstract: Climate events arise from intricate, multivariate dynamics governed by
global-scale drivers, profoundly impacting food, energy, and infrastructure.
Yet, accurate weather prediction remains elusive due to physical processes
unfolding across diverse spatio-temporal scales, which fixed-resolution methods
cannot capture. Hierarchical Graph Neural Networks (HGNNs) offer a multiscale
representation, but nonlinear downward mappings often erase global trends,
weakening the integration of physics into forecasts. We introduce HiFlowCast
and its ensemble variant HiAntFlow, HGNNs that embed physics within a
multiscale prediction framework. Two innovations underpin their design: a
Latent-Memory-Retention mechanism that preserves global trends during downward
traversal, and a Latent-to-Physics branch that integrates PDE solution fields
across diverse scales. Our Flow models cut errors by over 5% at 13-day lead
times and by 5-8% under 1st and 99th quantile extremes, improving reliability
for rare events. Leveraging pretrained model weights, they converge within a
single epoch, reducing training cost and their carbon footprint. Such
efficiency is vital as the growing scale of machine learning challenges
sustainability and limits research accessibility. Code and model weights are in
the supplementary materials.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本研究提出基于动态图神经网络（Dynamic GNN）的数据驱动方法，用于生理药代动力学（PBPK）建模，相比传统ODE方法和基线深度学习模型，能更准确地预测药物浓度动态。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统PBPK建模依赖常微分方程和简化假设，难以捕捉非线性生理相互作用。需要探索数据驱动的方法来提高预测准确性和适应性。

Method: 提出动态图神经网络（Dynamic GNN），将器官间生理连接建模为循环消息传递过程。同时实现多层感知机（MLP）和长短期记忆网络（LSTM）作为基线模型。

Result: Dynamic GNN在所有模型中表现最佳，R²为0.9342，RMSE为0.0159，MAE为0.0116。MLP基线R²为0.8705，LSTM为0.8059。

Conclusion: 显式建模器官相互作用的时空依赖性可实现更准确和可推广的药物浓度预测。Dynamic GNN为传统PBPK建模提供了可扩展的无方程替代方案。

Abstract: Physiologically Based Pharmacokinetic (PBPK) modeling plays a critical role
in drug development by predicting drug concentration dynamics across organs.
Traditional approaches rely on ordinary differential equations with strong
simplifying assumptions, which limit their adaptability to nonlinear
physiological interactions. In this study, we explore data-driven alternatives
for PBPK prediction using deep learning. Two baseline architectures - a
multilayer perceptron (MLP) and a long short-term memory (LSTM) network - are
implemented to capture molecular and temporal dependencies, respectively. To
incorporate inter-organ interactions, we propose a Dynamic Graph Neural Network
(Dynamic GNN) that models physiological connections as recurrent
message-passing processes between organs. Experimental results demonstrate that
the proposed Dynamic GNN achieves the highest predictive performance among all
models, with an R^2 of 0.9342, an RMSE of 0.0159, and an MAE of 0.0116. In
comparison, the MLP baseline obtains an R^2 of 0.8705 and the LSTM achieves
0.8059. These results highlight that explicitly modeling the spatial and
temporal dependencies of organ interactions enables more accurate and
generalizable drug concentration prediction. The Dynamic GNN provides a
scalable, equation-free alternative to traditional PBPK formulations and
demonstrates strong potential for data-driven pharmacokinetic modeling in
preclinical and clinical research.

TL;DR: 提出AniDS框架，通过各向异性变分自编码器改进3D分子去噪，解决了现有方法假设原子运动为各向同性和同方差性的问题，在分子力场预测任务上取得显著提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有坐标去噪方法依赖于过度简化的分子动力学假设，认为原子运动是各向同性和同方差性的，这与实际分子系统的方向性和结构变异性不符。

Method: 引入结构感知的各向异性噪声生成器，能够产生原子特定的全协方差矩阵，通过原子间相互作用作为各向同性基的各向异性修正，确保协方差矩阵对称、半正定且SO(3)等变。

Result: 在MD17和OC22基准测试中，AniDS优于先前的各向同性和同方差去噪模型及其他领先方法，力预测准确率平均相对提升8.9%和6.2%。

Conclusion: AniDS能够自适应地抑制键合方向的噪声，符合物理化学原理，为分子力场学习提供了更准确的去噪框架。

Abstract: Coordinate denoising has emerged as a promising method for 3D molecular
pretraining due to its theoretical connection to learning molecular force
field. However, existing denoising methods rely on oversimplied molecular
dynamics that assume atomic motions to be isotropic and homoscedastic. To
address these limitations, we propose a novel denoising framework AniDS:
Anisotropic Variational Autoencoder for 3D Molecular Denoising. AniDS
introduces a structure-aware anisotropic noise generator that can produce
atom-specific, full covariance matrices for Gaussian noise distributions to
better reflect directional and structural variability in molecular systems.
These covariances are derived from pairwise atomic interactions as anisotropic
corrections to an isotropic base. Our design ensures that the resulting
covariance matrices are symmetric, positive semi-definite, and
SO(3)-equivariant, while providing greater capacity to model complex molecular
dynamics. Extensive experiments show that AniDS outperforms prior isotropic and
homoscedastic denoising models and other leading methods on the MD17 and OC22
benchmarks, achieving average relative improvements of 8.9% and 6.2% in force
prediction accuracy. Our case study on a crystal and molecule structure shows
that AniDS adaptively suppresses noise along the bonding direction, consistent
with physicochemical principles. Our code is available at

Conclusion: 提出的方法能够高效地实现效用保持的机器遗忘，在遗忘效果和模型性能之间达到更好的平衡

Abstract: Machine unlearning (MU) aims to efficiently remove sensitive or harmful
memory from a pre-trained model. The key challenge is to balance the potential
tradeoff between unlearning efficacy and utility preservation, which involves
forgetting undesirable information as defined while maintaining the model's
original performance. One potential way to tackle this problem is to use
multi-objective optimization to jointly optimize both the unlearning and
utility preservation objectives. However, existing multi-objective methods only
guarantee finding a Pareto-optimal solution without fine-grained control, which
causes under-optimization of the unlearning objective. To this end, we first
model MU as a constrained optimization problem, that is, optimizing the
unlearning objective under the constraint of a bounded increase for utility
loss. We then show that solving this optimization problem is equivalent to
unilateral gradient surgery on the unlearning objective. To resolve the
additional computational cost brought by gradient surgery, we propose an
implicit gradient surgery method, which approximates the solution to the
aforementioned constrained optimization problem via only one backpropagation,
thereby achieving efficient utility-preserving MU. Theoretically, we provide a
tight convergence analysis of the algorithm. Empirically, our extensive
experiments show that the proposed algorithm achieves better tradeoff results
than existing baselines. Codes are available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: NCO模型虽然性能优异，但其表示和决策原理仍是黑盒，阻碍了学术研究和实际部署，需要深入理解NCO模型的内部机制。

Method: 采用多种探测任务分析NCO模型表示，并引入新颖的CS-Probing工具，通过检查探测过程中的系数和统计显著性进行深度分析。

Result: 发现NCO模型编码了解决方案构建所需的低层信息和促进更好决策的高层知识；CS-Probing揭示了不同NCO模型对其学习表示施加了不同的归纳偏置，发现了与模型泛化相关的直接证据，并识别了与特定知识相关的关键嵌入维度。

Conclusion: 这项工作展示了探测作为分析NCO模型内部机制的有前景工具，为NCO社区提供了重要见解，通过少量代码修改即可改进模型的泛化能力。

Abstract: Neural combinatorial optimization (NCO) has achieved remarkable performance,
yet its learned model representations and decision rationale remain a black
box. This impedes both academic research and practical deployment, since
researchers and stakeholders require deeper insights into NCO models. In this
paper, we take the first critical step towards interpreting NCO models by
investigating their representations through various probing tasks. Moreover, we
introduce a novel probing tool named Coefficient Significance Probing
(CS-Probing) to enable deeper analysis of NCO representations by examining the
coefficients and statistical significance during probing. Extensive experiments
and analysis reveal that NCO models encode low-level information essential for
solution construction, while capturing high-level knowledge to facilitate
better decisions. Using CS-Probing, we find that prevalent NCO models impose
varying inductive biases on their learned representations, uncover direct
evidence related to model generalization, and identify key embedding dimensions
associated with specific knowledge. These insights can be potentially
translated into practice, for example, with minor code modifications, we
improve the generalization of the analyzed model. Our work represents a first
systematic attempt to interpret black-box NCO models, showcasing probing as a
promising tool for analyzing their internal mechanisms and revealing insights
for the NCO community. The source code is publicly available.

TL;DR: TN-SHAP使用张量网络替代模型，将Shapley值的O(2^n)联盟枚举复杂度降低为少量评估，大幅提升计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统Shapley值计算需要枚举所有特征联盟，复杂度为O(2^n)，在大规模特征场景下计算成本过高。

Method: 将预测器的局部行为表示为因子化多线性映射，通过张量网络替代模型，用少量针对性评估提取k阶Shapley交互作用。

Result: 在UCI数据集上，该方法与枚举方法在拟合替代模型上结果一致，但评估次数减少数个数量级，相比KernelSHAP-IQ实现25-1000倍加速。

Conclusion: TN-SHAP通过张量网络表示有效降低了Shapley值计算复杂度，为大规模特征解释提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: We show how to replace the O(2^n) coalition enumeration over n features
behind Shapley values and Shapley-style interaction indices with a
few-evaluation scheme on a tensor-network (TN) surrogate: TN-SHAP. The key idea
is to represent a predictor's local behavior as a factorized multilinear map,
so that coalitional quantities become linear probes of a coefficient tensor.
TN-SHAP replaces exhaustive coalition sweeps with just a small number of
targeted evaluations to extract order-k Shapley interactions. In particular,
both order-1 (single-feature) and order-2 (pairwise) computations have cost
O(n*poly(chi) + n^2), where chi is the TN's maximal cut rank. We provide
theoretical guarantees on the approximation error and tractability of TN-SHAP.
On UCI datasets, our method matches enumeration on the fitted surrogate while
reducing evaluation by orders of magnitude and achieves 25-1000x wall-clock
speedups over KernelSHAP-IQ at comparable accuracy, while amortizing training
across local cohorts.

Method: 结合神经元功能归因识别两类关键知识神经元（知识通用神经元和知识特定神经元），并引入熵引导的动态稀疏掩码定位目标知识相关神经元，实现精确的神经元级知识编辑。

Result: 数千次连续编辑实验表明，NMKE在保持高编辑成功率和维护模型通用能力方面优于现有方法。

Conclusion: NMKE通过细粒度的神经元级编辑策略，有效解决了终身知识编辑中的错误累积问题，实现了更精确和可持续的知识更新。

Abstract: Lifelong knowledge editing enables continuous, precise updates to outdated
knowledge in large language models (LLMs) without computationally expensive
full retraining. However, existing methods often accumulate errors throughout
the editing process, causing a gradual decline in both editing accuracy and
generalization. To tackle this problem, we propose Neuron-Specific Masked
Knowledge Editing (NMKE), a novel fine-grained editing framework that combines
neuron-level attribution with dynamic sparse masking. Leveraging neuron
functional attribution, we identify two key types of knowledge neurons, with
knowledge-general neurons activating consistently across prompts and
knowledge-specific neurons activating to specific prompts. NMKE further
introduces an entropy-guided dynamic sparse mask, locating relevant neurons to
the target knowledge. This strategy enables precise neuron-level knowledge
editing with fewer parameter modifications. Experimental results from thousands
of sequential edits demonstrate that NMKE outperforms existing methods in
maintaining high editing success rates and preserving model general
capabilities in lifelong editing.

Abstract: Mean field games (MFGs) have emerged as a powerful framework for modeling
interactions in large-scale multi-agent systems. Despite recent advancements in
reinforcement learning (RL) for MFGs, existing methods are typically limited to
finite spaces or stationary models, hindering their applicability to real-world
problems. This paper introduces a novel deep reinforcement learning (DRL)
algorithm specifically designed for non-stationary continuous MFGs. The
proposed approach builds upon a Fictitious Play (FP) methodology, leveraging
DRL for best-response computation and supervised learning for average policy
representation. Furthermore, it learns a representation of the time-dependent
population distribution using a Conditional Normalizing Flow. To validate the
effectiveness of our method, we evaluate it on three different examples of
increasing complexity. By addressing critical limitations in scalability and
density approximation, this work represents a significant advancement in
applying DRL techniques to complex MFG problems, bringing the field closer to
real-world multi-agent systems.

TL;DR: 本文研究了基于排序的嵌入方法β_A，改进了嵌入维度D的上界并给出了下界，证明了双Lipschitz失真与n的平方相关且与d无关，同时提供了输出维度缩减的变体结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在图表深度学习中，需要处理图节点排列不变性的问题。基于排序的嵌入方法β_A虽然已知在足够大的D下是单射且满足双Lipschitz条件，但存在两个关键问题：最优嵌入维度D未知，以及缺乏双Lipschitz常数的估计。

Method: 通过构造特定的矩阵A，分析基于排序的嵌入β_A的性质，包括单射性和双Lipschitz条件。同时研究了通过线性投影减少输出维度的变体方法。

Result: 改进了嵌入维度D的上界并提供了最小单射维度的下界；证明了β_A的双Lipschitz失真与n的平方相关且与d无关；同时证明了失真至少为Ω(√n)；对输出维度缩减的变体也得到了类似结果。

Conclusion: 本文在基于排序的嵌入方法研究上取得了重要进展，解决了嵌入维度最优性和双Lipschitz常数估计两个关键问题，为图表深度学习中的排列不变性处理提供了理论支持。

Abstract: We study the sorting-based embedding $\beta_{\mathbf A} : \mathbb R^{n \times
d} \to \mathbb R^{n \times D}$, $\mathbf X \mapsto {\downarrow}(\mathbf X
\mathbf A)$, where $\downarrow$ denotes column wise sorting of matrices. Such
embeddings arise in graph deep learning where outputs should be invariant to
permutations of graph nodes. Previous work showed that for large enough $D$ and
appropriate $\mathbf A$, the mapping $\beta_{\mathbf A}$ is injective, and
moreover satisfies a bi-Lipschitz condition. However, two gaps remain: firstly,
the optimal size $D$ required for injectivity is not yet known, and secondly,
no estimates of the bi-Lipschitz constants of the mapping are known.
  In this paper, we make substantial progress in addressing both of these gaps.
Regarding the first gap, we improve upon the best known upper bounds for the
embedding dimension $D$ necessary for injectivity, and also provide a lower
bound on the minimal injectivity dimension. Regarding the second gap, we
construct matrices $\mathbf A$, so that the bi-Lipschitz distortion of
$\beta_{\mathbf A} $ depends quadratically on $n$, and is completely
independent of $d$. We also show that the distortion of $\beta_{\mathbf A}$ is
necessarily at least in $\Omega(\sqrt{n})$. Finally, we provide similar results
for variants of $\beta_{\mathbf A}$ obtained by applying linear projections to
reduce the output dimension of $\beta_{\mathbf A}$.

Abstract: Task-specific pre-training is essential when task representations diverge
from generic pre-training features. Existing task-general pre-training EEG
models struggle with complex tasks like emotion recognition due to mismatches
between task-specific features and broad pre-training approaches. This work
aims to develop a task-specific multi-dataset joint pre-training framework for
cross-dataset emotion recognition, tackling problems of large inter-dataset
distribution shifts, inconsistent emotion category definitions, and substantial
inter-subject variability. We introduce a cross-dataset covariance alignment
loss to align second-order statistical properties across datasets, enabling
robust generalization without the need for extensive labels or per-subject
calibration. To capture the long-term dependency and complex dynamics of EEG,
we propose a hybrid encoder combining a Mamba-like linear attention channel
encoder and a spatiotemporal dynamics model. Our method outperforms
state-of-the-art large-scale EEG models by an average of 4.57% in AUROC for
few-shot emotion recognition and 11.92% in accuracy for zero-shot
generalization to a new dataset. Performance scales with the increase of
datasets used in pre-training. Multi-dataset joint pre-training achieves a
performance gain of 8.55% over single-dataset training. This work provides a
scalable framework for task-specific pre-training and highlights its benefit in
generalizable affective computing. Our code is available at

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) can achieve near-optimal lossless compression by
acting as powerful probability models. We investigate their use in the lossy
domain, where reconstruction fidelity is traded for higher compression ratios.
This paper introduces Error-Bounded Predictive Coding (EPC), a lossy text codec
that leverages a Masked Language Model (MLM) as a decompressor. Instead of
storing a subset of original tokens, EPC allows the model to predict masked
content and stores minimal, rank-based corrections only when the model's top
prediction is incorrect. This creates a residual channel that offers continuous
rate-distortion control. We compare EPC to a simpler Predictive Masking (PM)
baseline and a transform-based Vector Quantisation with a Residual Patch
(VQ+RE) approach. Through an evaluation that includes precise bit accounting
and rate-distortion analysis, we demonstrate that EPC consistently dominates
PM, offering superior fidelity at a significantly lower bit rate by more
efficiently utilising the model's intrinsic knowledge.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种利用公开模型库进行知识转移的方法，通过数据分区策略让预训练模型自主扮演学生或教师角色，在图像分类、语义分割和视频显著性预测等任务中取得了显著性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有预训练模型在不同设计选择下表现出多样化的泛化行为，某些模型掌握了其他模型无法获得的数据特定洞察。论文旨在利用大型公开模型库作为模型改进的辅助资源。

Method: 提出数据分区策略，让预训练模型自主选择扮演学生（寻求知识）或教师（传授知识）的角色，支持双向知识转移和跨架构知识共享。

Result: 在图像分类中，ViT-B通过双向知识转移性能提升约1.4%；语义分割中所有评估指标均得到提升；视频显著性预测达到新的最先进水平；多模型知识转移为所有参与模型带来显著性能改进。

Conclusion: 该方法有效利用了模型库中的多样化知识，通过自主角色分配和知识转移机制，在各种计算机视觉任务中实现了显著的性能提升。

Abstract: Pretrained models are ubiquitous in the current deep learning landscape,
offering strong results on a broad range of tasks. Recent works have shown that
models differing in various design choices exhibit categorically diverse
generalization behavior, resulting in one model grasping distinct data-specific
insights unavailable to the other. In this paper, we propose to leverage large
publicly available model repositories as an auxiliary source of model
improvements. We introduce a data partitioning strategy where pretrained models
autonomously adopt either the role of a student, seeking knowledge, or that of
a teacher, imparting knowledge. Experiments across various tasks demonstrate
the effectiveness of our proposed approach. In image classification, we
improved the performance of ViT-B by approximately 1.4% through bidirectional
knowledge transfer with ViT-T. For semantic segmentation, our method boosted
all evaluation metrics by enabling knowledge transfer both within and across
backbone architectures. In video saliency prediction, our approach achieved a
new state-of-the-art. We further extend our approach to knowledge transfer
between multiple models, leading to considerable performance improvements for
all model participants.

Motivation: 在算法决策中，公平机器学习方法通常产生多个平衡预测公平性和性能的模型，这种多样性给利益相关者选择合适的模型带来了挑战。

Method: 使用弱监督度量学习学习反映公平性和性能相似性的Mahalanobis距离，然后应用k-means聚类基于特征重要性表示对模型进行分组。

Result: 该框架能够有效组织模型特征重要性空间，帮助用户探索具有相似预测行为和公平性特征的模型集群。

Conclusion: 该交互式框架通过展示模型在公平性-性能平衡和驱动预测的特征方面的差异，促进了知情决策。

Abstract: In the context of algorithmic decision-making, fair machine learning methods
often yield multiple models that balance predictive fairness and performance in
varying degrees. This diversity introduces a challenge for stakeholders who
must select a model that aligns with their specific requirements and values. To
address this, we propose an interactive framework that assists in navigating
and interpreting the trade-offs across a portfolio of models. Our approach
leverages weakly supervised metric learning to learn a Mahalanobis distance
that reflects similarity in fairness and performance outcomes, effectively
structuring the feature importance space of the models according to
stakeholder-relevant criteria. We then apply clustering technique (k-means) to
group models based on their transformed representations of feature importances,
allowing users to explore clusters of models with similar predictive behaviors
and fairness characteristics. This facilitates informed decision-making by
helping users understand how models differ not only in their
fairness-performance balance but also in the features that drive their
predictions.

TL;DR: 层剪枝会严重损害大语言模型的测试时缩放能力，即使只剪枝1-2层也会导致长链推理性能急剧下降，而标准微调方法无法恢复这种能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有层剪枝方法在通用知识任务上表现良好，但对长链推理这种更脆弱但关键能力的影响尚未被充分研究。

Method: 通过测试时缩放的视角研究层剪枝对长链推理的影响，进行大量实验分析剪枝层数对推理性能的影响。

Result: 剪枝1-2层就会严重损害测试时缩放，长推理基准测试性能急剧下降，而知识密集型和浅层推理任务性能保持稳定。标准监督微调无法恢复已受损的测试时缩放能力。

Conclusion: 层剪枝对推理密集型大语言模型存在根本性风险，需要重新思考层剪枝策略并开发能保持推理鲁棒性的方法。

Abstract: Layer pruning has emerged as a widely adopted technique for improving the
efficiency of large language models (LLMs). Although existing methods
demonstrate strong performance retention on general knowledge tasks, their
effect on long-chain reasoning, a more brittle yet crucial capability, remains
largely unexplored. In this work, we study the impact of layer pruning on
long-chain reasoning through the lens of test-time scaling, a key mechanism in
modern LLMs that enables strong reasoning capacity by allocating more
computation at inference time. With extensive experiments, we demonstrate that
pruning even one or two layers can severely impair test-time scaling, with
performance collapsing drastically on long reasoning benchmarks even when
performance on knowledge-intensive and shallow reasoning tasks remains stable.
Furthermore, we find that standard supervised fine-tuning remedies fail to
recover test-time scaling once it has deteriorated. Through in-depth analyses,
we identify the mechanisms underlying this fragility of test-time scaling and
highlight the fundamental risks of applying layer pruning to
reasoning-intensive LLMs. These findings call for a rethinking of layer pruning
strategies and provide insights for developing methods that preserve the
robustness of reasoning. We open-source the codebase in

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决EEG数据中电极布局异构性导致的模型泛化问题，传统方法难以处理不同数据集定义的电极布局差异。

Method: 使用学习查询和交叉注意力将多通道EEG压缩到固定大小的拓扑无关潜在空间，下游transformer块在潜在表示上使用补丁式时间自注意力，计算与电极数量解耦。

Result: 在TUEG和Siena数据集（超过21,000小时原始EEG）上预训练，在异常检测、伪影拒绝、慢波分类和情绪识别四个下游任务中表现优异，在TUAR上达到0.921 AUROC，同时计算量减少300倍，GPU内存使用减少10倍。

Conclusion: LUNA能够有效处理EEG电极布局异构性，在保持高性能的同时显著提升计算效率，为大规模EEG建模提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) offers a non-invasive lens into human brain
activity, but building large-scale models is hampered by topological
heterogeneity: each public EEG data defines its own electrode layout, limiting
generalization. We introduce LUNA (Latent Unified Network Architecture), a
self-supervised foundation model that reconciles disparate electrode geometries
while scaling linearly -- not quadratically -- with channel count. LUNA
compresses multi-channel EEG into a fixed-size, topology-agnostic latent space
via learned queries and cross-attention. Downstream transformer blocks then
operate exclusively on this latent representation using patch-wise temporal
self-attention, decoupling computation from electrode count. Pre-trained on
TUEG and Siena (over 21,000 hours of raw EEG across diverse montages) using a
masked-patch reconstruction objective, LUNA transfers effectively to four
downstream tasks: abnormality detection, artifact rejection, slowing
classification, and emotion recognition. It demonstrates highly competitive
performance across several benchmarks, achieving state-of-the-art results on
TUAR and TUSL, e.g., 0.921 AUROC on TUAR, while reducing FLOPs by 300x and
trimming GPU memory use by up to 10x. Critically, these gains are consistent
across all evaluated electrode configurations. Code is available at

<details>

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Machine learning has achieved remarkable successes, yet its deployment in
safety-critical domains remains hindered by an inherent inability to manage
uncertainty, resulting in overconfident and unreliable predictions when models
encounter out-of-distribution data, adversarial perturbations, or naturally
fluctuating environments. This thesis, titled Epistemic Deep Learning: Enabling
Machine Learning Models to 'Know When They Do Not Know', addresses these
critical challenges by advancing the paradigm of Epistemic Artificial
Intelligence, which explicitly models and quantifies epistemic uncertainty: the
uncertainty arising from limited, biased, or incomplete training data, as
opposed to the irreducible randomness of aleatoric uncertainty, thereby
empowering models to acknowledge their limitations and refrain from
overconfident decisions when uncertainty is high.
  Central to this work is the development of the Random-Set Neural Network
(RS-NN), a novel methodology that leverages random set theory to predict belief
functions over sets of classes, capturing the extent of epistemic uncertainty
through the width of associated credal sets, applications of RS-NN, including
its adaptation to Large Language Models (LLMs) and its deployment in weather
classification for autonomous racing. In addition, the thesis proposes a
unified evaluation framework for uncertainty-aware classifiers. Extensive
experiments validate that integrating epistemic awareness into deep learning
not only mitigates the risks associated with overconfident predictions but also
lays the foundation for a paradigm shift in artificial intelligence, where the
ability to 'know when it does not know' becomes a hallmark of robust and
dependable systems. The title encapsulates the core philosophy of this work,
emphasizing that true intelligence involves recognizing and managing the limits
of one's own knowledge.

Conclusion: 学业表现是系统性现象，与学校生态系统密切相关。研究提供了数据驱动的可解释工具，有助于制定促进教育公平的政策。

Abstract: Identifying the factors that influence student performance in basic education
is a central challenge for formulating effective public policies in Brazil.
This study introduces a multi-level machine learning approach to classify the
proficiency of 9th-grade and high school students using microdata from the
System of Assessment of Basic Education (SAEB). Our model uniquely integrates
four data sources: student socioeconomic characteristics, teacher professional
profiles, school indicators, and director management profiles. A comparative
analysis of four ensemble algorithms confirmed the superiority of a Random
Forest model, which achieved 90.2% accuracy and an Area Under the Curve (AUC)
of 96.7%. To move beyond prediction, we applied Explainable AI (XAI) using
SHAP, which revealed that the school's average socioeconomic level is the most
dominant predictor, demonstrating that systemic factors have a greater impact
than individual characteristics in isolation. The primary conclusion is that
academic performance is a systemic phenomenon deeply tied to the school's
ecosystem. This study provides a data-driven, interpretable tool to inform
policies aimed at promoting educational equity by addressing disparities
between schools.

Abstract: The growing instability of both global and domestic economic environments has
increased the risk of financial distress at the household level. However,
traditional econometric models often rely on delayed and aggregated data,
limiting their effectiveness. This study introduces a machine learning-based
early warning system that utilizes real-time digital and macroeconomic signals
to identify financial distress in near real-time. Using a panel dataset of 750
households tracked over three monitoring rounds spanning 13 months, the
framework combines socioeconomic attributes, macroeconomic indicators (such as
GDP growth, inflation, and foreign exchange fluctuations), and digital economy
measures (including ICT demand and market volatility). Through data
preprocessing and feature engineering, we introduce lagged variables,
volatility measures, and interaction terms to capture both gradual and sudden
changes in financial stability. We benchmark baseline classifiers, such as
logistic regression and decision trees, against advanced ensemble models
including random forests, XGBoost, and LightGBM. Our results indicate that the
engineered features from the digital economy significantly enhance predictive
accuracy. The system performs reliably for both binary distress detection and
multi-class severity classification, with SHAP-based explanations identifying
inflation volatility and ICT demand as key predictors. Crucially, the framework
is designed for scalable deployment in national agencies and low-bandwidth
regional offices, ensuring it is accessible for policymakers and practitioners.
By implementing machine learning in a transparent and interpretable manner,
this study demonstrates the feasibility and impact of providing near-real-time
early warnings of financial distress. This offers actionable insights that can
strengthen household resilience and guide preemptive intervention strategies.

Motivation: 现实世界中的测试图常存在数据质量问题和分布偏移，导致预训练模型性能下降。研究发现通过调整图结构的同质性可以显著改善模型鲁棒性。

Method: 开发同质性预测器来判别测试边，基于预测的同质性分数置信度进行自适应的测试时图结构转换。

Conclusion: 基于同质性的测试时图结构转换是提升预训练GNN模型鲁棒性的有效方法，无需模型重新训练。

Abstract: Homophily, the tendency of nodes from the same class to connect, is a
fundamental property of real-world graphs, underpinning structural and semantic
patterns in domains such as citation networks and social networks. Existing
methods exploit homophily through designing homophily-aware GNN architectures
or graph structure learning strategies, yet they primarily focus on GNN
learning with training graphs. However, in real-world scenarios, test graphs
often suffer from data quality issues and distribution shifts, such as domain
shifts across users from different regions in social networks and temporal
evolution shifts in citation network graphs collected over varying time
periods. These factors significantly compromise the pre-trained model's
robustness, resulting in degraded test-time performance. With empirical
observations and theoretical analysis, we reveal that transforming the test
graph structure by increasing homophily in homophilic graphs or decreasing it
in heterophilic graphs can significantly improve the robustness and performance
of pre-trained GNNs on node classifications, without requiring model training
or update. Motivated by these insights, a novel test-time graph structural
transformation method grounded in homophily, named GrapHoST, is proposed.
Specifically, a homophily predictor is developed to discriminate test edges,
facilitating adaptive test-time graph structural transformation by the
confidence of predicted homophily scores. Extensive experiments on nine
benchmark datasets under a range of test-time data quality issues demonstrate
that GrapHoST consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance, with
improvements of up to 10.92%. Our code has been released at

Motivation: MASLD影响约33%的美国成年人，是常见的慢性肝病，早期检测很重要，因为生活方式干预可以预防疾病进展。需要开发公平、严谨且可复现的预测模型。

Method: 评估了LASSO逻辑回归、随机森林、XGBoost和神经网络，使用临床特征子集，包括前10个SHAP排名特征。应用平等机会后处理方法减少种族和民族亚组间的真阳性率差异。

Result: 训练数据59,492例，验证数据24,198例，测试数据25,188例。选择前10个特征的LASSO逻辑回归模型，公平性调整前：AUROC 0.84，准确率78%，敏感性72%，特异性79%，F1分数0.617；调整后：准确率81%，特异性94%，敏感性41%，F1分数0.515。

Conclusion: MASER预测模型在MASLD预测中实现了竞争性性能，与先前报告的集成和基于树的模型相当。该方法表明可解释模型可以在多样化患者群体中实现预测性能和公平性的平衡。

Abstract: Background: Metabolic Dysfunction-Associated Steatotic Liver Disease (MASLD)
affects ~33% of U.S. adults and is the most common chronic liver disease.
Although often asymptomatic, progression can lead to cirrhosis. Early detection
is important, as lifestyle interventions can prevent disease progression. We
developed a fair, rigorous, and reproducible MASLD prediction model and
compared it to prior methods using a large electronic health record database.
  Methods: We evaluated LASSO logistic regression, random forest, XGBoost, and
a neural network for MASLD prediction using clinical feature subsets, including
the top 10 SHAP-ranked features. To reduce disparities in true positive rates
across racial and ethnic subgroups, we applied an equal opportunity
postprocessing method.
  Results: This study included 59,492 patients in the training data, 24,198 in
the validating data, and 25,188 in the testing data. The LASSO logistic
regression model with the top 10 features was selected for its interpretability
and comparable performance. Before fairness adjustment, the model achieved
AUROC of 0.84, accuracy of 78%, sensitivity of 72%, specificity of 79%, and
F1-score of 0.617. After equal opportunity postprocessing, accuracy modestly
increased to 81% and specificity to 94%, while sensitivity decreased to 41% and
F1-score to 0.515, reflecting the fairness trade-off.
  Conclusions: We developed the MASER prediction model (MASLD Static EHR Risk
Prediction), a LASSO logistic regression model which achieved competitive
performance for MASLD prediction (AUROC 0.836, accuracy 77.6%), comparable to
previously reported ensemble and tree-based models. Overall, this approach
demonstrates that interpretable models can achieve a balance of predictive
performance and fairness in diverse patient populations.

Abstract: Timely access to laboratory values is critical for clinical decision-making,
yet current approaches rely on invasive venous sampling and are intrinsically
delayed. Electrocardiography (ECG), as a non-invasive and widely available
signal, offers a promising modality for rapid laboratory estimation. Recent
progress in deep learning has enabled the extraction of latent hematological
signatures from ECGs. However, existing models are constrained by low
signal-to-noise ratios, substantial inter-individual variability, limited data
diversity, and suboptimal generalization, especially when adapted to low-lead
wearable devices. In this work, we conduct an exploratory study leveraging
transfer learning to fine-tune ECGFounder, a large-scale pre-trained ECG
foundation model, on the Multimodal Clinical Monitoring in the Emergency
Department (MC-MED) dataset from Stanford. We generated a corpus of more than
20 million standardized ten-second ECG segments to enhance sensitivity to
subtle biochemical correlates. On internal validation, the model demonstrated
strong predictive performance (area under the curve above 0.65) for
thirty-three laboratory indicators, moderate performance (between 0.55 and
0.65) for fifty-nine indicators, and limited performance (below 0.55) for
sixteen indicators. This study provides an efficient artificial-intelligence
driven solution and establishes the feasibility scope for real-time,
non-invasive estimation of laboratory values.

Conclusion: LLMs可作为可解释的、类似专家的假设生成器，利用类比驱动的泛化推动科学创新

Abstract: Analogical reasoning, the transfer of relational structures across contexts
(e.g., planet is to sun as electron is to nucleus), is fundamental to
scientific discovery. Yet human insight is often constrained by domain
expertise and surface-level biases, limiting access to deeper, structure-driven
analogies both within and across disciplines. Large language models (LLMs),
trained on vast cross-domain data, present a promising yet underexplored tool
for analogical reasoning in science. Here, we demonstrate that LLMs can
generate novel battery materials by (1) retrieving cross-domain analogs and
analogy-guided exemplars to steer exploration beyond conventional dopant
substitutions, and (2) constructing in-domain analogical templates from few
labeled examples to guide targeted exploitation. These explicit analogical
reasoning strategies yield candidates outside established compositional spaces
and outperform standard prompting baselines. Our findings position LLMs as
interpretable, expert-like hypothesis generators that leverage analogy-driven
generalization for scientific innovation.

Conclusion: 贪婪策略在常见条件下性能良好，提出的学习算法在未知转移概率情况下具有计算效率优势

Abstract: We consider a node-monitor pair, where the node's state varies with time. The
monitor needs to track the node's state at all times; however, there is a fixed
cost for each state query. So the monitor may instead predict the state using
time-series forecasting methods, including time-series foundation models
(TSFMs), and query only when prediction uncertainty is high. Since query
decisions influence prediction accuracy, determining when to query is
nontrivial. A natural approach is a greedy policy that predicts when the
expected prediction loss is below the query cost and queries otherwise. We
analyze this policy in a Markovian setting, where the optimal (OPT) strategy is
a state-dependent threshold policy minimizing the time-averaged sum of query
cost and prediction losses. We show that, in general, the greedy policy is
suboptimal and can have an unbounded competitive ratio, but under common
conditions such as identically distributed transition probabilities, it
performs close to OPT. For the case of unknown transition probabilities, we
further propose a projected stochastic gradient descent (PSGD)-based learning
variant of the greedy policy, which achieves a favorable predict-query tradeoff
with improved computational efficiency compared to OPT.

Motivation: 当前LLM可解释性研究主要关注通过代理模块发现特征，但很少系统比较这些学习特征是否比原始模型参数中的特征具有更好的特性。

Method: 将前馈层视为键值记忆，使用现代可解释性基准重新评估FF层中存储的特征向量，并与SAE学习到的特征进行广泛比较。

Result: SAE和FF表现出相似的可解释性范围，SAE在某些方面有轻微改进，但在某些方面FF甚至比SAE表现更好，且两者发现的特征存在分歧。

Conclusion: SAE在特征质量和忠实性方面的优势受到质疑，FF键值参数应作为现代可解释性研究的强基线。

Abstract: Recent interpretability work on large language models (LLMs) has been
increasingly dominated by a feature-discovery approach with the help of proxy
modules. Then, the quality of features learned by, e.g., sparse auto-encoders
(SAEs), is evaluated. This paradigm naturally raises a critical question: do
such learned features have better properties than those already represented
within the original model parameters, and unfortunately, only a few studies
have made such comparisons systematically so far. In this work, we revisit the
interpretability of feature vectors stored in feed-forward (FF) layers, given
the perspective of FF as key-value memories, with modern interpretability
benchmarks. Our extensive evaluation revealed that SAE and FFs exhibits a
similar range of interpretability, although SAEs displayed an observable but
minimal improvement in some aspects. Furthermore, in certain aspects,
surprisingly, even vanilla FFs yielded better interpretability than the SAEs,
and features discovered in SAEs and FFs diverged. These bring questions about
the advantage of SAEs from both perspectives of feature quality and
faithfulness, compared to directly interpreting FF feature vectors, and FF
key-value parameters serve as a strong baseline in modern interpretability

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一个四步部分贝叶斯框架，用于本构模型发现中的不确定性量化，无需材料参数先验选择，可发现非线性本构模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法需要材料参数先验选择、仅限于模型库的线性系数或推断参数概率分布灵活性不足，因此需要更灵活的不确定性量化框架。

Method: 四步框架：1) 用高斯过程增强应力-变形数据；2) 用归一化流近似参数分布；3) 通过匹配参数诱导的应力-变形函数分布与高斯过程后验来精炼参数分布；4) 进行Sobol'敏感性分析获得稀疏可解释模型。

Result: 框架在各项同性和各向异性实验数据以及线性和非线性模型库中均表现出良好能力。

Conclusion: 所提出的部分贝叶斯框架能够有效量化本构模型发现中的不确定性，无需参数先验且适用于非线性模型发现。

Abstract: Constitutive model discovery refers to the task of identifying an appropriate
model structure, usually from a predefined model library, while simultaneously
inferring its material parameters. The data used for model discovery are
measured in mechanical tests and are thus inevitably affected by noise which,
in turn, induces uncertainties. Previously proposed methods for uncertainty
quantification in model discovery either require the selection of a prior for
the material parameters, are restricted to the linear coefficients of the model
library or are limited in the flexibility of the inferred parameter probability
distribution. We therefore propose a four-step partially Bayesian framework for
uncertainty quantification in model discovery that does not require prior
selection for the material parameters and also allows for the discovery of
non-linear constitutive models: First, we augment the available
stress-deformation data with a Gaussian process. Second, we approximate the
parameter distribution by a normalizing flow, which allows for capturing
complex joint distributions. Third, we distill the parameter distribution by
matching the distribution of stress-deformation functions induced by the
parameters with the Gaussian process posterior. Fourth, we perform a Sobol'
sensitivity analysis to obtain a sparse and interpretable model. We demonstrate
the capability of our framework for both isotropic and anisotropic experimental
data as well as linear and non-linear model libraries.

### [96] [Mapping Faithful Reasoning in Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22362)
*Jiazheng Li,Andreas Damianou,J Rosser,José Luis Redondo García,Konstantina Palla*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了Concept Walk框架，通过分析模型在概念方向上的内部激活变化来评估推理轨迹的真实性，发现简单案例中的推理往往是装饰性的，而困难案例中的推理更忠实。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的思维链推理轨迹并不总是真实反映模型内部计算，可能导致从业者误解装饰性推理为真实推理，需要更可靠的评估方法。

Method: Concept Walk框架在激活空间中操作，将每个推理步骤投影到从对比数据学习的概念方向上，追踪模型内部立场随概念方向的演化。

Result: 在安全领域案例研究中发现，简单案例中扰动的思维链被快速忽略（装饰性推理），而困难案例中扰动引起内部激活持续变化（忠实推理）。

Conclusion: Concept Walk提供了通过概念特定内部动态重新审视推理忠实性的方法，有助于识别何时可以信任推理轨迹以及何时可能误导从业者。

Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) traces promise transparency for reasoning language
models, but prior work shows they are not always faithful reflections of
internal computation. This raises challenges for oversight: practitioners may
misinterpret decorative reasoning as genuine. We introduce Concept Walk, a
general framework for tracing how a model's internal stance evolves with
respect to a concept direction during reasoning. Unlike surface text, Concept
Walk operates in activation space, projecting each reasoning step onto the
concept direction learned from contrastive data. This allows us to observe
whether reasoning traces shape outcomes or are discarded. As a case study, we
apply Concept Walk to the domain of Safety using Qwen 3-4B. We find that in
'easy' cases, perturbed CoTs are quickly ignored, indicating decorative
reasoning, whereas in 'hard' cases, perturbations induce sustained shifts in
internal activations, consistent with faithful reasoning. The contribution is
methodological: Concept Walk provides a lens to re-examine faithfulness through
concept-specific internal dynamics, helping identify when reasoning traces can
be trusted and when they risk misleading practitioners.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有公平机器学习研究依赖于少数数据集，这些数据集通常随意选择、处理不一致且缺乏多样性，削弱了结果的泛化性和可复现性。

Method: FairGround包含44个表格数据集，每个数据集都标注了丰富的公平性相关元数据。配套的Python包标准化了数据集加载、预处理、转换和拆分流程。

Result: FairGround提供了多样化和良好文档化的数据集语料库以及强大的工具支持。

Conclusion: FairGround支持开发更公平、更可靠和更可复现的机器学习模型，所有资源都公开可用以支持开放协作研究。

Abstract: As machine learning (ML) systems are increasingly adopted in high-stakes
decision-making domains, ensuring fairness in their outputs has become a
central challenge. At the core of fair ML research are the datasets used to
investigate bias and develop mitigation strategies. Yet, much of the existing
work relies on a narrow selection of datasets--often arbitrarily chosen,
inconsistently processed, and lacking in diversity--undermining the
generalizability and reproducibility of results.
  To address these limitations, we present FairGround: a unified framework,
data corpus, and Python package aimed at advancing reproducible research and
critical data studies in fair ML classification. FairGround currently comprises
44 tabular datasets, each annotated with rich fairness-relevant metadata. Our
accompanying Python package standardizes dataset loading, preprocessing,
transformation, and splitting, streamlining experimental workflows. By
providing a diverse and well-documented dataset corpus along with robust
tooling, FairGround enables the development of fairer, more reliable, and more
reproducible ML models. All resources are publicly available to support open
and collaborative research.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了平滑梯度上升(SGA)方法，通过将遗忘数据与构造的正常数据结合，解决了传统梯度上升(GA)方法在LLM遗忘中的不稳定性问题，在保持模型效用的同时实现更稳定的遗忘。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统梯度上升(GA)方法在LLM遗忘中存在严重不稳定性，会导致模型效用急剧下降，需要一种更稳定的遗忘方法。

Method: SGA将遗忘数据与多个构造的正常数据通过可调平滑率结合，从仅学习遗忘数据扩展到联合学习遗忘和正常数据，实现更稳定的遗忘。

Result: 在TOFU、Harry Potter和MUSE-NEWS三个基准测试中，SGA在所有指标上都优于原始GA方法，并在多个关键指标上达到所有基线方法的前2名。

Conclusion: SGA通过平滑梯度上升有效解决了LLM遗忘中的稳定性问题，在保持模型效用的同时实现了更好的遗忘效果。

Abstract: LLM unlearning has emerged as a promising approach, aiming to enable models
to forget hazardous/undesired knowledge at low cost while preserving as much
model utility as possible. Among existing techniques, the most straightforward
method is performing Gradient Ascent (GA) w.r.t. the forget data, thereby
forcing the model to unlearn the forget dataset. However, GA suffers from
severe instability, as it drives updates in a divergent direction, often
resulting in drastically degraded model utility. To address this issue, we
propose Smoothed Gradient Ascent (SGA). SGA combines the forget data with
multiple constructed normal data through a tunable smoothing rate. Intuitively,
this extends GA from learning solely on the forget data to jointly learning
across both forget and normal data, enabling more stable unlearning while
better preserving model utility. Theoretically, we provide the theoretical
guidance on the selection of the optimal smoothing rate. Empirically, we
evaluate SGA on three benchmarks: TOFU, Harry Potter, and MUSE-NEWS.
Experimental results demonstrate that SGA consistently outperforms the original
Gradient Ascent (GA) method across all metrics and achieves top-2 performance
among all baseline methods on several key metrics.

*David Freire-Obregón,José Salas-Cáceres,Modesto Castrillón-Santana*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出用康威生命游戏替代dropout进行正则化，通过动态单元失活和空间模式演化来提升神经网络泛化能力，在CIFAR-10数据集上取得与传统dropout相当的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统dropout正则化技术存在静态性和缺乏可解释性的局限性，需要一种更动态、可解释的正则化方法。

Method: 将神经网络单元表示为康威生命游戏网格中的细胞，应用游戏规则动态失活单元，让空间模式根据训练数据自适应演化。

Result: 在CIFAR-10数据集上，该方法与传统dropout技术性能相当，同时通过演化模式可视化提供了网络行为的洞察。

Conclusion: 康威生命游戏驱动的动态单元失活是一种有效的正则化替代方案，特别适用于深层架构，能增强不同dropout技术的性能。

Abstract: Regularization techniques play a crucial role in preventing overfitting and
improving the generalization performance of neural networks. Dropout, a widely
used regularization technique, randomly deactivates units during training to
introduce redundancy and prevent co-adaptation among neurons. Despite its
effectiveness, dropout has limitations, such as its static nature and lack of
interpretability. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to regularization
by substituting dropout with Conway's Game of Life (GoL), a cellular automata
with simple rules that govern the evolution of a grid of cells. We introduce
dynamic unit deactivation during training by representing neural network units
as cells in a GoL grid and applying the game's rules to deactivate units. This
approach allows for the emergence of spatial patterns that adapt to the
training data, potentially enhancing the network's ability to generalize. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on the CIFAR-10 dataset, showing
that dynamic unit deactivation using GoL achieves comparable performance to
traditional dropout techniques while offering insights into the network's
behavior through the visualization of evolving patterns. Furthermore, our
discussion highlights the applicability of our proposal in deeper
architectures, demonstrating how it enhances the performance of different
dropout techniques.

*Yasas Senarath,Hemant Purohit*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于增强的回放式持续学习方法，通过整合外部知识库来解决数据漂移和灾难性遗忘问题，在异常行为分类任务中表现优于基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在线平台用户行为不断变化导致数据漂移，使模型性能下降。持续学习中的灾难性遗忘问题限制了模型的有效更新，而传统回放方法受限于固定缓冲区大小。

Method: 提出增强式回放持续学习框架，利用外部知识库进行数据增强，克服缓冲区大小限制。评估了多种策略在三个异常行为分类数据集上的表现。

Result: 实验结果表明，基于增强的方法在持续学习环境中优于基线回放方法，能够更好地整合外部知识。

Conclusion: 通过外部知识增强的回放式持续学习能有效缓解数据漂移和灾难性遗忘问题，提升在线行为分析系统的长期性能。

Abstract: User behavior on online platforms is evolving, reflecting real-world changes
in how people post, whether it's helpful messages or hate speech. Models that
learn to capture this content can experience a decrease in performance over
time due to data drift, which can lead to ineffective behavioral analytics
systems. However, fine-tuning such a model over time with new data can be
detrimental due to catastrophic forgetting. Replay-based approaches in
continual learning offer a simple yet efficient method to update such models,
minimizing forgetting by maintaining a buffer of important training instances
from past learned tasks. However, the main limitation of this approach is the
fixed size of the buffer. External knowledge bases can be utilized to overcome
this limitation through data augmentation. We propose a novel
augmentation-based approach to incorporate external knowledge in the
replay-based continual learning framework. We evaluate several strategies with
three datasets from prior studies related to deviant behavior classification to
assess the integration of external knowledge in continual learning and
demonstrate that augmentation helps outperform baseline replay-based
approaches.

TL;DR: 本文研究了低精度流式PCA，建立了实现目标精度所需量化分辨率的信息论下界，分析了Oja算法在线性和非线性随机量化下的性能，证明了批处理版本在两种方案下都能达到接近下界的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究在流式设置下使用有限精度计算进行PCA的问题，探索在量化约束下如何有效估计主成分，并建立量化分辨率与估计精度之间的理论关系。

Method: 使用Oja算法进行流式PCA，在线性和非线性随机量化方案下量化权重向量和更新，在温和的矩和谱间隙假设下分析算法性能。

Result: 证明了批处理版本在线性和非线性量化方案下都能达到信息论下界（对数因子内），在非线性量化设置下实现了几乎与维度无关的量化误差。

Conclusion: 低精度流式PCA方法能够接近标准Oja算法的性能，在量化约束下仍能有效估计主成分，为资源受限环境下的PCA应用提供了理论基础。

Abstract: Low-precision streaming PCA estimates the top principal component in a
streaming setting under limited precision. We establish an
information-theoretic lower bound on the quantization resolution required to
achieve a target accuracy for the leading eigenvector. We study Oja's algorithm
for streaming PCA under linear and nonlinear stochastic quantization. The
quantized variants use unbiased stochastic quantization of the weight vector
and the updates. Under mild moment and spectral-gap assumptions on the data
distribution, we show that a batched version achieves the lower bound up to
logarithmic factors under both schemes. This leads to a nearly dimension-free
quantization error in the nonlinear quantization setting. Empirical evaluations
on synthetic streams validate our theoretical findings and demonstrate that our
low-precision methods closely track the performance of standard Oja's
algorithm.

*Amin Omidvar*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SmartMixed是一种两阶段训练策略，允许网络学习每个神经元的最优激活函数，同时保持推理时的计算效率。第一阶段神经元从候选激活函数池中自适应选择，第二阶段固定激活函数以支持高效训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统神经网络使用固定的统一激活函数，限制了模型表达能力。需要一种方法让网络学习最优的每神经元激活函数，同时保持计算效率。

Method: 两阶段训练：第一阶段使用可微分硬混合机制让神经元从候选函数池（ReLU、Sigmoid、Tanh等）中选择；第二阶段固定激活函数，支持向量化操作的高效训练。

Result: 在MNIST数据集上的实验表明，不同层中的神经元对激活函数表现出不同的偏好，揭示了神经网络架构中的功能多样性。

Conclusion: SmartMixed成功实现了每神经元激活函数的自适应学习，在保持计算效率的同时提升了模型表达能力，为理解神经网络内部功能多样性提供了新视角。

Abstract: The choice of activation function plays a critical role in neural networks,
yet most architectures still rely on fixed, uniform activation functions across
all neurons. We introduce SmartMixed, a two-phase training strategy that allows
networks to learn optimal per-neuron activation functions while preserving
computational efficiency at inference. In the first phase, neurons adaptively
select from a pool of candidate activation functions (ReLU, Sigmoid, Tanh,
Leaky ReLU, ELU, SELU) using a differentiable hard-mixture mechanism. In the
second phase, each neuron's activation function is fixed according to the
learned selection, resulting in a computationally efficient network that
supports continued training with optimized vectorized operations. We evaluate
SmartMixed on the MNIST dataset using feedforward neural networks of varying
depths. The analysis shows that neurons in different layers exhibit distinct
preferences for activation functions, providing insights into the functional
diversity within neural architectures.

Motivation: 现有图提示方法主要关注特征导向方法，忽略了拓扑导向提示的潜力，导致性能次优。本文旨在探索图拓扑提示的可能性。

Method: 将拓扑导向提示重新表述为多跳局部子图中的边重连问题，通过重参数化松弛到连续概率空间，同时确保紧密松弛和保持图稀疏性。

Result: 在五个图数据集和四种预训练策略下的广泛实验表明，GraphTOP在多个节点分类数据集上优于六个基线方法。

Conclusion: GraphTOP是首个面向图拓扑的提示框架，通过有效修改图拓扑来适应预训练GNN模型，在多个任务上表现出优越性能。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have revolutionized the field of graph learning
by learning expressive graph representations from massive graph data. As a
common pattern to train powerful GNNs, the "pre-training, adaptation" scheme
first pre-trains GNNs over unlabeled graph data and subsequently adapts them to
specific downstream tasks. In the adaptation phase, graph prompting is an
effective strategy that modifies input graph data with learnable prompts while
keeping pre-trained GNN models frozen. Typically, existing graph prompting
studies mainly focus on *feature-oriented* methods that apply graph prompts to
node features or hidden representations. However, these studies often achieve
suboptimal performance, as they consistently overlook the potential of
*topology-oriented* prompting, which adapts pre-trained GNNs by modifying the
graph topology. In this study, we conduct a pioneering investigation of graph
prompting in terms of graph topology. We propose the first **Graph**
**T**opology-**O**riented **P**rompting (GraphTOP) framework to effectively
adapt pre-trained GNN models for downstream tasks. More specifically, we
reformulate topology-oriented prompting as an edge rewiring problem within
multi-hop local subgraphs and relax it into the continuous probability space
through reparameterization while ensuring tight relaxation and preserving graph
sparsity. Extensive experiments on five graph datasets under four pre-training
strategies demonstrate that our proposed GraphTOP outshines six baselines on
multiple node classification datasets. Our code is available at
https://github.com/xbfu/GraphTOP.

TL;DR: GradLite是一种内存高效的优化器，通过近似梯度和误差反馈技术，在丢弃中间激活时仍能保持训练效率，减少50%内存消耗且性能不降。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统优化器需要精确梯度，导致大语言模型全参数微调时内存消耗巨大。现有解决方案要么改变模型架构，要么以计算换内存，但优化器本身未被改进。

Method: 使用低秩雅可比矩阵近似降低反向传播误差信号的维度，结合误差反馈校正技术累积和补偿近似误差，保持收敛保证。

Result: 理论分析显示GradLite保持无偏梯度估计和有界方差，经验验证减少50%优化器状态和激活内存消耗，在推理、多语言和对话基准测试中性能相当或优于基线方法。

Conclusion: GradLite通过放松精确梯度要求，在不改变模型架构的情况下显著降低内存消耗，为大语言模型高效微调提供了新途径。

Abstract: Full fine-tuning of Large Language Models (LLMs) is notoriously
memory-intensive, primarily because conventional optimizers such as SGD or Adam
assume access to exact gradients derived from cached activations. Existing
solutions either alter the model architecture (e.g., reversible networks) or
trade memory for computation (e.g., activation checkpointing), but the
optimizer itself remains untouched. In this work, we introduce GradLite, a
backward-friendly optimizer that relaxes the requirement of exact gradients,
enabling efficient training even when intermediate activations are aggressively
discarded or approximated. GradLite leverages two key techniques: (i) low-rank
Jacobian approximation, which reduces the dimensionality of backpropagated
error signals, and (ii) error-feedback correction, which accumulates and
compensates approximation errors across iterations to preserve convergence
guarantees. We provide a theoretical analysis showing that GradLite maintains
unbiased gradient estimates with bounded variance, ensuring convergence rates
comparable to Adam. Empirically, GradLite reduces optimizer-state and
activation memory consumption by up to 50\% without architectural changes, and
achieves on-par or superior downstream performance on reasoning (MMLU, GSM8K),
multilingual, and dialogue benchmarks compared to checkpointing and
optimizer-centric baselines (LoMo, GaLore).

Result: 实验表明CORGII在准确性和效率之间提供了比多个基线方法更好的权衡。

Conclusion: CORGII是首个使用离散标记映射到高效倒排列表的密集图表示索引器，为图检索任务提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Retrieving graphs from a large corpus, that contain a subgraph isomorphic to
a given query graph, is a core operation in many real-world applications. While
recent multi-vector graph representations and scores based on set alignment and
containment can provide accurate subgraph isomorphism tests, their use in
retrieval remains limited by their need to score corpus graphs exhaustively. We
introduce CORGII (Contextual Representation of Graphs for Inverted Indexing), a
graph indexing framework in which, starting with a contextual dense graph
representation, a differentiable discretization module computes sparse binary
codes over a learned latent vocabulary. This text document-like representation
allows us to leverage classic, highly optimized inverted indices, while
supporting soft (vector) set containment scores. Pushing this paradigm further,
we replace the classical, fixed impact weight of a `token' on a graph (such as
TFIDF or BM25) with a data-driven, trainable impact weight. Finally, we explore
token expansion to support multi-probing the index for smoother
accuracy-efficiency tradeoffs. To our knowledge, CORGII is the first indexer of
dense graph representations using discrete tokens mapping to efficient inverted
lists. Extensive experiments show that CORGII provides better trade-offs
between accuracy and efficiency, compared to several baselines.

Motivation: 解决当前3D生成方法依赖大数据集、可控性差和泛化能力有限的问题，实现数据高效的可控3D生成。

Method: 首先通过共享初始化对齐SDF解码器，然后在对齐权重空间中求解参数约束的混合问题，并通过线性度不匹配检测几何有效性。

Conclusion: LAMP推进了可控、数据高效且安全的3D生成，适用于设计探索、数据集生成和性能驱动优化。

Abstract: Generating high-fidelity 3D geometries that satisfy specific parameter
constraints has broad applications in design and engineering. However, current
methods typically rely on large training datasets and struggle with
controllability and generalization beyond the training distributions. To
overcome these limitations, we introduce LAMP (Linear Affine Mixing of
Parametric shapes), a data-efficient framework for controllable and
interpretable 3D generation. LAMP first aligns signed distance function (SDF)
decoders by overfitting each exemplar from a shared initialization, then
synthesizes new geometries by solving a parameter-constrained mixing problem in
the aligned weight space. To ensure robustness, we further propose a safety
metric that detects geometry validity via linearity mismatch. We evaluate LAMP
on two 3D parametric benchmarks: DrivAerNet++ and BlendedNet. We found that
LAMP enables (i) controlled interpolation within bounds with as few as 100
samples, (ii) safe extrapolation by up to 100% parameter difference beyond
training ranges, (iii) physics performance-guided optimization under fixed
parameters. LAMP significantly outperforms conditional autoencoder and Deep
Network Interpolation (DNI) baselines in both extrapolation and data
efficiency. Our results demonstrate that LAMP advances controllable,
data-efficient, and safe 3D generation for design exploration, dataset
generation, and performance-driven optimization.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于互补标签的可扩展监督框架，用于评估和训练前沿AI系统，无需真实标签。该方法利用人类专家的领域知识提供弱信号（指出错误选项），通过无偏估计器结合稀缺的普通标签和丰富的互补标签来实现监督。

Motivation: 随着AI系统在多个领域超越人类专家，获取高质量的人类监督变得困难。人类专家通常只精通狭窄领域，无法评估AI在超人任务上的正确性，但可以提供互补标签指出错误选项。

Method: 开发了从互补标签推导top-1准确率的无偏估计器，量化了替代普通标签所需的互补标签数量。引入两种估计器来结合稀缺的普通标签和丰富的互补标签，并提供有限样本偏差保证。

Conclusion: 互补标签提供了一种可扩展的监督机制，使得在没有真实标签的情况下评估和训练前沿AI系统成为可能，解决了人类专家知识局限性的问题。

Abstract: As artificial intelligence (AI) systems approach and surpass expert human
performance across a broad range of tasks, obtaining high-quality human
supervision for evaluation and training becomes increasingly challenging. Our
focus is on tasks that require deep knowledge and skills of multiple domains.
Unfortunately, even the best human experts are knowledgeable only in a single
narrow area, and will not be able to evaluate the correctness of advanced AI
systems on such superhuman tasks. However, based on their narrow expertise,
humans may provide a weak signal, i.e., a complementary label indicating an
option that is incorrect. For example, a cardiologist could state that "this is
not related to cardiology,'' even if they cannot identify the true disease.
Based on this weak signal, we propose a scalable oversight framework that
enables us to evaluate frontier AI systems without the need to prepare the
ground truth. We derive an unbiased estimator of top-1 accuracy from
complementary labels and quantify how many complementary labels are needed to
match the variance of ordinary labels. We further introduce two estimators to
combine scarce ordinary labels with abundant complementary labels. We provide
finite-sample deviation guarantees for both complementary-only and the mixed
estimators. Empirically, we show that we can evaluate the output of large
language models without the ground truth, if we have complementary labels. We
further show that we can train an AI system with such weak signals: we show how
we can design an agentic AI system automatically that can perform better with
this partitioned human supervision. Our code is available at

Abstract: Materials discovery requires navigating vast chemical and structural spaces
while satisfying multiple, often conflicting, objectives. We present LLM-guided
Evolution for MAterials design (LLEMA), a unified framework that couples the
scientific knowledge embedded in large language models with chemistry-informed
evolutionary rules and memory-based refinement. At each iteration, an LLM
proposes crystallographically specified candidates under explicit property
constraints; a surrogate-augmented oracle estimates physicochemical properties;
and a multi-objective scorer updates success/failure memories to guide
subsequent generations. Evaluated on 14 realistic tasks spanning electronics,
energy, coatings, optics, and aerospace, LLEMA discovers candidates that are
chemically plausible, thermodynamically stable, and property-aligned, achieving
higher hit-rates and stronger Pareto fronts than generative and LLM-only
baselines. Ablation studies confirm the importance of rule-guided generation,
memory-based refinement, and surrogate prediction. By enforcing
synthesizability and multi-objective trade-offs, LLEMA delivers a principled
pathway to accelerate practical materials discovery.

### [109] [CANDI: Hybrid Discrete-Continuous Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22510)
*Patrick Pynadath,Jiaxin Shi,Ruqi Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文分析了连续扩散在离散数据上表现不佳的原因，提出了CANDI混合框架来解决离散和连续噪声机制之间的时间不协调问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 连续扩散在连续域（如图像生成）表现出色，但在离散数据上表现不如纯离散方法，这种差距与直觉相悖。

Method: 引入token可识别性分析框架，提出CANDI混合框架，解耦离散和连续噪声机制，同时学习条件结构和连续几何。

Result: 实证验证了时间不协调现象，CANDI成功避免了该问题，在控制生成中实现分类器引导，在文本生成中在低NFE时优于掩码扩散。

Conclusion: CANDI解锁了连续扩散在离散空间的优势，证明了学习连续梯度对离散空间的价值。

Abstract: While continuous diffusion has shown remarkable success in continuous domains
such as image generation, its direct application to discrete data has
underperformed compared to purely discrete formulations. This gap is
counterintuitive, given that continuous diffusion learns score functions that
enable joint evolution across multiple positions. To understand this gap, we
introduce token identifiability as an analytical framework for understanding
how Gaussian noise corrupts discrete data through two mechanisms: discrete
identity corruption and continuous rank degradation. We reveal that these
mechanisms scale differently with vocabulary size, creating a temporal
dissonance: at noise levels where discrete corruption preserves enough
structure for conditional learning, continuous denoising is trivial; at noise
levels where continuous denoising is meaningful, discrete corruption destroys
nearly all conditional structure. To solve this, we propose CANDI (Continuous
ANd DIscrete diffusion), a hybrid framework that decouples discrete and
continuous corruption, enabling simultaneous learning of both conditional
structure and continuous geometry. We empirically validate the temporal
dissonance phenomenon and demonstrate that CANDI successfully avoids it. This
unlocks the benefits of continuous diffusion for discrete spaces: on controlled
generation, CANDI enables classifier-based guidance with off-the-shelf
classifiers through simple gradient addition; on text generation, CANDI
outperforms masked diffusion at low NFE, demonstrating the value of learning
continuous gradients for discrete spaces.

*Seohong Park,Aditya Oberai,Pranav Atreya,Sergey Levine*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出TRL算法，一种基于分治范式的值学习算法，用于离线目标条件强化学习，通过三角不等式结构实现分治值更新规则。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决离线目标条件强化学习中传统方法（如TD和蒙特卡洛）存在的偏差累积和高方差问题，特别是在长轨迹场景下。

Method: 将GCRL中的三角不等式结构转化为实用的分治值更新规则，只需O(log T)次递归处理长度为T的轨迹。

Result: 在极具挑战性的长视野基准任务中，TRL相比之前的离线GCRL算法取得了最佳性能。

Conclusion: TRL算法通过分治范式有效解决了离线GCRL中的值学习问题，在偏差积累和方差控制方面优于传统方法。

Abstract: In this work, we present Transitive Reinforcement Learning (TRL), a new value
learning algorithm based on a divide-and-conquer paradigm. TRL is designed for
offline goal-conditioned reinforcement learning (GCRL) problems, where the aim
is to find a policy that can reach any state from any other state in the
smallest number of steps. TRL converts a triangle inequality structure present
in GCRL into a practical divide-and-conquer value update rule. This has several
advantages compared to alternative value learning paradigms. Compared to
temporal difference (TD) methods, TRL suffers less from bias accumulation, as
in principle it only requires $O(\log T)$ recursions (as opposed to $O(T)$ in
TD learning) to handle a length-$T$ trajectory. Unlike Monte Carlo methods, TRL
suffers less from high variance as it performs dynamic programming.
Experimentally, we show that TRL achieves the best performance in highly
challenging, long-horizon benchmark tasks compared to previous offline GCRL
algorithms.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了RIDGE框架，通过联合去噪图输入和监督目标来提高符号图神经网络的鲁棒性，扩展了图信息瓶颈理论以处理输入和目标空间中的噪声。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 符号图神经网络在处理真实世界噪声连接时缺乏理论指导的鲁棒性研究，现有方法主要依赖经验性质，需要理论驱动的鲁棒SGNN框架。

Method: 扩展图信息瓶颈理论，使其能够同时处理输入空间和目标空间的噪声，通过重参数化机制和变分近似构建可处理的优化目标函数，联合去噪输入数据与监督目标。

Result: 在四个主流符号图数据集上的实验表明，RIDGE显著提高了流行SGNN模型在不同噪声水平下的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: RIDGE框架成功地将图信息瓶颈理论扩展到符号图学习领域，通过联合去噪机制有效提升了符号图神经网络的鲁棒性表现。

Abstract: Signed Graph Neural Networks (SGNNs) are widely adopted to analyze complex
patterns in signed graphs with both positive and negative links. Given the
noisy nature of real-world connections, the robustness of SGNN has also emerged
as a pivotal research area. Under the supervision of empirical properties,
graph structure learning has shown its robustness on signed graph
representation learning, however, there remains a paucity of research
investigating a robust SGNN with theoretical guidance. Inspired by the success
of graph information bottleneck (GIB) in information extraction, we propose
RIDGE, a novel framework for Robust sI gned graph learning through joint
Denoising of Graph inputs and supervision targEts. Different from the basic
GIB, we extend the GIB theory with the capability of target space denoising as
the co-existence of noise in both input and target spaces. In instantiation,
RIDGE effectively cleanses input data and supervision targets via a tractable
objective function produced by reparameterization mechanism and variational
approximation. We extensively validate our method on four prevalent signed
graph datasets, and the results show that RIDGE clearly improves the robustness
of popular SGNN models under various levels of noise.

*Pedro Chumpitaz-Flores,My Duong,Cristobal Heredia,Kaixun Hua*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了SDC-GBB算法，通过可分解的分支定界框架处理约束聚类问题，能够处理大规模数据集并保证全局最优性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有混合整数优化方法只能处理小规模数据集，限制了约束聚类的实际应用

Method: 将必须链接样本折叠为基于质心的伪样本，通过几何规则修剪不能链接，结合分组样本拉格朗日分解和几何消除规则

Result: 能处理20万样本的不能链接约束和150万样本的必须链接约束，比现有方法规模大200-1500倍，最优性差距小于3%

Conclusion: 该方法提供了确定性全局保证，避免了现成启发式方法在大数据集上的搜索失败问题

Abstract: Constrained clustering leverages limited domain knowledge to improve
clustering performance and interpretability, but incorporating pairwise
must-link and cannot-link constraints is an NP-hard challenge, making global
optimization intractable. Existing mixed-integer optimization methods are
confined to small-scale datasets, limiting their utility. We propose
Sample-Driven Constrained Group-Based Branch-and-Bound (SDC-GBB), a
decomposable branch-and-bound (BB) framework that collapses must-linked samples
into centroid-based pseudo-samples and prunes cannot-link through geometric
rules, while preserving convergence and guaranteeing global optimality. By
integrating grouped-sample Lagrangian decomposition and geometric elimination
rules for efficient lower and upper bounds, the algorithm attains highly
scalable pairwise k-Means constrained clustering via parallelism. Experimental
results show that our approach handles datasets with 200,000 samples with
cannot-link constraints and 1,500,000 samples with must-link constraints, which
is 200 - 1500 times larger than the current state-of-the-art under comparable
constraint settings, while reaching an optimality gap of less than 3%. In
providing deterministic global guarantees, our method also avoids the search
failures that off-the-shelf heuristics often encounter on large datasets.

*Michael Ito,Danai Koutra,Jenna Wiens*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出随机搜索神经网络(RSNNs)来解决随机游走神经网络(RWNNs)在采样约束下无法捕获全局图结构的问题，通过在稀疏图中仅需O(log|V|)次搜索实现完整边覆盖，显著减少采样复杂度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随机游走神经网络在现实采样约束下往往无法捕获小图的全局结构，因为节点和边覆盖不完整，限制了其表达能力。

Method: 提出随机搜索神经网络，基于随机搜索操作，每次搜索保证完整节点覆盖。在稀疏图中仅需O(log|V|)次搜索即可实现完整边覆盖。

Result: 理论上证明RSNNs是通用逼近器，且概率上对图同构不变。实证表明在分子和蛋白质基准测试中，RSNNs始终优于RWNNs，仅需最多16倍更少的采样序列即可达到相当或更优性能。

Conclusion: RSNNs为基于随机游走的方法提供了理论和实践上的进展，为稀疏图学习提供了一个高效且表达力强的框架。

Abstract: Random walk neural networks (RWNNs) have emerged as a promising approach for
graph representation learning, leveraging recent advances in sequence models to
process random walks. However, under realistic sampling constraints, RWNNs
often fail to capture global structure even in small graphs due to incomplete
node and edge coverage, limiting their expressivity. To address this, we
propose \textit{random search neural networks} (RSNNs), which operate on random
searches, each of which guarantees full node coverage. Theoretically, we
demonstrate that in sparse graphs, only $O(\log |V|)$ searches are needed to
achieve full edge coverage, substantially reducing sampling complexity compared
to the $O(|V|)$ walks required by RWNNs (assuming walk lengths scale with graph
size). Furthermore, when paired with universal sequence models, RSNNs are
universal approximators. We lastly show RSNNs are probabilistically invariant
to graph isomorphisms, ensuring their expectation is an isomorphism-invariant
graph function. Empirically, RSNNs consistently outperform RWNNs on molecular
and protein benchmarks, achieving comparable or superior performance with up to
16$\times$ fewer sampled sequences. Our work bridges theoretical and practical
advances in random walk based approaches, offering an efficient and expressive
framework for learning on sparse graphs.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: IsoNet++是一个基于早期交互的图神经网络，通过跨图消息传递、惰性对齐更新和节点对交互等创新技术，显著提升了子图匹配的检索性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的子图同构检索方法如IsoNet采用后期交互模型，独立计算图嵌入后再进行对齐。为了更有效地进行子图匹配，需要开发早期交互模型来在嵌入计算过程中直接整合图间信息。

Method: 1) 在输入图间进行跨图消息传递，基于节点间的单射对齐；2) 多轮惰性对齐更新，每轮从头运行GNN；3) 引入节点对交互概念，考虑节点对而非单个节点作为潜在伙伴，利用边存在性差异来优化对齐。

Result: 实验表明，随着轮次增加，对齐逐步优化，在多个数据集上实现了比现有方法显著更好的检索性能。所有三个创新技术都对性能提升有贡献。

Conclusion: IsoNet++通过早期交互、惰性对齐更新和节点对交互等创新，有效提升了子图匹配的准确性和检索性能，为图检索应用提供了更优的解决方案。

Abstract: Graph retrieval based on subgraph isomorphism has several real-world
applications such as scene graph retrieval, molecular fingerprint detection and
circuit design. Roy et al. [35] proposed IsoNet, a late interaction model for
subgraph matching, which first computes the node and edge embeddings of each
graph independently of paired graph and then computes a trainable alignment
map. Here, we present IsoNet++, an early interaction graph neural network
(GNN), based on several technical innovations. First, we compute embeddings of
all nodes by passing messages within and across the two input graphs, guided by
an injective alignment between their nodes. Second, we update this alignment in
a lazy fashion over multiple rounds. Within each round, we run a layerwise GNN
from scratch, based on the current state of the alignment. After the completion
of one round of GNN, we use the last-layer embeddings to update the alignments,
and proceed to the next round. Third, IsoNet++ incorporates a novel notion of
node-pair partner interaction. Traditional early interaction computes attention
between a node and its potential partners in the other graph, the attention
then controlling messages passed across graphs. In contrast, we consider node
pairs (not single nodes) as potential partners. Existence of an edge between
the nodes in one graph and non-existence in the other provide vital signals for
refining the alignment. Our experiments on several datasets show that the
alignments get progressively refined with successive rounds, resulting in
significantly better retrieval performance than existing methods. We
demonstrate that all three innovations contribute to the enhanced accuracy. Our
code and datasets are publicly available at

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出FAPO方法，通过识别和惩罚有缺陷的推理轨迹来解决RLVR中错误推理模式被强化的问题，在保持早期训练稳定性的同时提升后期推理可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在强化学习与可验证奖励(RLVR)中，包含错误推理模式（如答案猜测、跳跃推理）但最终答案正确的轨迹会被同等奖励，导致模型学习不可靠的推理模式，限制了推理能力的进一步提升。

Method: 提出Flawed-Aware Policy Optimization (FAPO)，对有缺陷的推理轨迹施加参数无关的奖励惩罚；引入生成式奖励模型(GenRM)提供过程级奖励，精确定位推理错误。

Result: 实验表明FAPO在多个领域有效，提高了结果正确性、过程可靠性和训练稳定性，且不增加token预算。

Conclusion: FAPO能够有效利用有缺陷轨迹作为训练初期的有用捷径，同时在后期优化阶段逐步转向可靠的推理模式，实现了更好的训练效果。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has emerged as a
promising paradigm for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language
models (LLMs). In this context, models explore reasoning trajectories and
exploit rollouts with correct answers as positive signals for policy
optimization. However, these rollouts might involve flawed patterns such as
answer-guessing and jump-in-reasoning. Such flawed-positive rollouts are
rewarded identically to fully correct ones, causing policy models to
internalize these unreliable reasoning patterns. In this work, we first conduct
a systematic study of flawed-positive rollouts in RL and find that they enable
rapid capability gains during the early optimization stage, while constraining
reasoning capability later by reinforcing unreliable patterns. Building on
these insights, we propose Flawed-Aware Policy Optimization (FAPO), which
presents a parameter-free reward penalty for flawed-positive rollouts, enabling
the policy to leverage them as useful shortcuts in the warm-up stage, securing
stable early gains, while gradually shifting optimization toward reliable
reasoning in the later refinement stage. To accurately and comprehensively
detect flawed-positive rollouts, we introduce a generative reward model (GenRM)
with a process-level reward that precisely localizes reasoning errors.
Experiments show that FAPO is effective in broad domains, improving outcome
correctness, process reliability, and training stability without increasing the
token budget.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着技术进步，流程日志越来越多地来自非确定性源（如不确定传感器或机器学习模型），这些随机已知的日志包含概率信息，需要可靠的随机轨迹恢复方法来理解系统流程。

Method: 基于扩散去噪概率模型(DDPM)的深度学习方法，利用流程知识（通过隐式发现模型或显式在训练阶段注入流程知识）通过去噪来恢复轨迹。

Result: 实证评估显示该方法达到最先进性能，比现有方法提升高达25%，并在高噪声水平下表现出更强的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该方法为处理不确定日志提供了有效的随机轨迹恢复解决方案，在性能和鲁棒性方面均优于现有方法。

Abstract: With recent technological advances, process logs, which were traditionally
deterministic in nature, are being captured from non-deterministic sources,
such as uncertain sensors or machine learning models (that predict activities
using cameras). In the presence of stochastically-known logs, logs that contain
probabilistic information, the need for stochastic trace recovery increases, to
offer reliable means of understanding the processes that govern such systems.
We design a novel deep learning approach for stochastic trace recovery, based
on Diffusion Denoising Probabilistic Models (DDPM), which makes use of process
knowledge (either implicitly by discovering a model or explicitly by injecting
process knowledge in the training phase) to recover traces by denoising. We
conduct an empirical evaluation demonstrating state-of-the-art performance with
up to a 25% improvement over existing methods, along with increased robustness
under high noise levels.

TL;DR: 提出了一个无需预知时间范围T的任意时间在线算法，用于学习对抗性凸成本函数序列，同时近似满足对抗性在线凸约束序列。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有算法需要预知时间范围T，且使用固定Lyapunov函数，导致实际性能较差。需要开发无需T先验知识的任意时间算法，避免标准加倍技巧带来的多次重启问题。

Method: 使用时间变化的Lyapunov函数跟踪约束违反，而非固定Lyapunov函数。引入新的分析技术处理时间变化Lyapunov函数带来的非单调性等挑战。

Result: 算法对任意t≥1实现O(√t)遗憾和Õ(√t)累积约束违反界。扩展到动态遗憾设置，无需预知比较器序列总长度即可适应其路径长度。

Conclusion: 提出的任意时间在线算法在理论和实践中均表现优异，避免了标准加倍技巧的缺点，在在线最短路径问题等应用中展示了实用价值。

Abstract: We propose an anytime online algorithm for the problem of learning a sequence
of adversarial convex cost functions while approximately satisfying another
sequence of adversarial online convex constraints. A sequential algorithm is
called \emph{anytime} if it provides a non-trivial performance guarantee for
any intermediate timestep $t$ without requiring prior knowledge of the length
of the entire time horizon $T$. Our proposed algorithm achieves optimal
performance bounds without resorting to the standard doubling trick, which has
poor practical performance due to multiple restarts. Our core technical
contribution is the use of time-varying Lyapunov functions to keep track of
constraint violations. This must be contrasted with prior works that used a
fixed Lyapunov function tuned to the known horizon length $T$. The use of
time-varying Lyapunov function poses unique analytical challenges as
properties, such as \emph{monotonicity}, on which the prior proofs rest, no
longer hold. By introducing a new analytical technique, we show that our
algorithm achieves $O(\sqrt{t})$ regret and $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{t})$ cumulative
constraint violation bounds for any $t\geq 1$.
  We extend our results to the dynamic regret setting, achieving bounds that
adapt to the path length of the comparator sequence without prior knowledge of
its total length. We also present an adaptive algorithm in the optimistic
setting, whose performance gracefully scales with the cumulative prediction
error. We demonstrate the practical utility of our algorithm through numerical
experiments involving the online shortest path problem.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 半监督学习中伪标签质量对模型性能影响很大，不准确的伪标签会引入偏差导致次优模型，需要平衡标注数据和伪标注数据的贡献。

Method: 基于PPI思想提出无偏梯度估计器，使用插值参数动态平衡标注和伪标注数据的贡献，通过一维在线学习算法实时调整插值参数和模型参数。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了半监督学习中伪标签偏差问题，通过在线调整插值参数实现了更好的模型性能。

Abstract: Prediction-Powered Inference (PPI) is a recently proposed statistical
inference technique for parameter estimation that leverages pseudo-labels on
both labeled and unlabeled data to construct an unbiased, low-variance
estimator. In this work, we extend its core idea to semi-supervised learning
(SSL) for model training, introducing a novel unbiased gradient estimator. This
extension addresses a key challenge in SSL: while unlabeled data can improve
model performance, its benefit heavily depends on the quality of pseudo-labels.
Inaccurate pseudo-labels can introduce bias, leading to suboptimal models.To
balance the contributions of labeled and pseudo-labeled data, we utilize an
interpolation parameter and tune it on the fly, alongside the model parameters,
using a one-dimensional online learning algorithm. We verify the practical
advantage of our approach through experiments on both synthetic and real
datasets, demonstrating improved performance over classic SSL baselines and PPI
methods that tune the interpolation parameter offline.

Abstract: Geometric data analysis and learning has emerged as a distinct and rapidly
developing research area, increasingly recognized for its effectiveness across
diverse applications. At the heart of this field lies curvature, a powerful and
interpretable concept that captures intrinsic geometric structure and underpins
numerous tasks, from community detection to geometric deep learning. A wide
range of discrete curvature models have been proposed for various data
representations, including graphs, simplicial complexes, cubical complexes, and
point clouds sampled from manifolds. These models not only provide efficient
characterizations of data geometry but also constitute essential components in
geometric learning frameworks. In this paper, we present the first
comprehensive review of existing discrete curvature models, covering their
mathematical foundations, computational formulations, and practical
applications in data analysis and learning. In particular, we discuss discrete
curvature from both Riemannian and metric geometry perspectives and propose a
systematic pipeline for curvature-driven data analysis. We further examine the
corresponding computational algorithms across different data representations,
offering detailed comparisons and insights. Finally, we review state-of-the-art
applications of curvature in both supervised and unsupervised learning. This
survey provides a conceptual and practical roadmap for researchers to gain a
better understanding of discrete curvature as a fundamental tool for geometric
understanding and learning.

TL;DR: CLEANet是一个针对污染多变量时间序列的鲁棒高效异常检测框架，通过污染弹性训练框架和轻量级共轭MLP解决训练数据污染和推理效率问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多变量时间序列异常检测面临训练数据污染（噪声和隐藏异常）和模型推理效率低两大挑战，现有方法假设训练数据干净且复杂模型容易过拟合污染数据。

Method: 提出污染弹性训练框架（CRTF），采用自适应重构加权策略结合聚类引导的对比学习来减轻污染样本影响；设计轻量级共轭MLP解耦时间和跨特征依赖关系。

Result: 在五个公共数据集上，CLEANet相比十个最先进基线方法，F1分数最高提升73.04%，运行时间降低81.28%；CRTF集成到三个先进模型中平均获得5.35%的F1增益。

Conclusion: CLEANet有效解决了多变量时间序列异常检测中的数据污染和效率问题，具有强泛化能力和实际应用价值。

Abstract: Multivariate time series (MTS) anomaly detection is essential for maintaining
the reliability of industrial systems, yet real-world deployment is hindered by
two critical challenges: training data contamination (noises and hidden
anomalies) and inefficient model inference. Existing unsupervised methods
assume clean training data, but contamination distorts learned patterns and
degrades detection accuracy. Meanwhile, complex deep models often overfit to
contamination and suffer from high latency, limiting practical use. To address
these challenges, we propose CLEANet, a robust and efficient anomaly detection
framework in contaminated multivariate time series. CLEANet introduces a
Contamination-Resilient Training Framework (CRTF) that mitigates the impact of
corrupted samples through an adaptive reconstruction weighting strategy
combined with clustering-guided contrastive learning, thereby enhancing
robustness. To further avoid overfitting on contaminated data and improve
computational efficiency, we design a lightweight conjugate MLP that
disentangles temporal and cross-feature dependencies. Across five public
datasets, CLEANet achieves up to 73.04% higher F1 and 81.28% lower runtime
compared with ten state-of-the-art baselines. Furthermore, integrating CRTF
into three advanced models yields an average 5.35% F1 gain, confirming its
strong generalizability.

Result: 相比最终层模型，推理速度提升1.55-1.85倍，性能损失极小。

Conclusion: FastVLM在效率和准确性之间取得了良好平衡，为视觉语言模型的高效推理提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Vision-language Models (VLMs) have made significant strides in visual
understanding and query response generation, but often face challenges of high
computational cost and inference latency due to autoregressive decoding. In
this work, we introduce an imitation-learning-based Self-Speculative Decoding
(SSD) framework, named FastVLM, to address these limitations. Our approach
employs a lightweight draft model for token generation in an autoregressive
manner, while a full model verifies these tokens non-autoregressively. Accepted
tokens proceed seamlessly, while rejected tokens are corrected by the full
model and used to guide the draft model's refinement. Through an imitation
network, FastVLM enhances the draft model by integrating deeper level insights
from the full model's architecture. Also, it maintains the performance
integrity of the full model while training the draft model, achieving a balance
between efficiency and accuracy. Our method speeds up the inference process by
1.55-1.85x as compared to the final layer with minimal loss in performance.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved strong performance across a range
of graph representation learning tasks, yet their adversarial robustness in
graph classification remains underexplored compared to node classification.
While most existing defenses focus on the message-passing component, this work
investigates the overlooked role of pooling operations in shaping robustness.
We present a theoretical analysis of standard flat pooling methods (sum,
average and max), deriving upper bounds on their adversarial risk and
identifying their vulnerabilities under different attack scenarios and graph
structures. Motivated by these insights, we propose \textit{Robust Singular
Pooling (RS-Pool)}, a novel pooling strategy that leverages the dominant
singular vector of the node embedding matrix to construct a robust graph-level
representation. We theoretically investigate the robustness of RS-Pool and
interpret the resulting bound leading to improved understanding of our proposed
pooling operator. While our analysis centers on Graph Convolutional Networks
(GCNs), RS-Pool is model-agnostic and can be implemented efficiently via power
iteration. Empirical results on real-world benchmarks show that RS-Pool
provides better robustness than the considered pooling methods when subject to
state-of-the-art adversarial attacks while maintaining competitive clean
accuracy. Our code is publicly available

Abstract: Density estimation is essential for generative modeling, particularly with
the rise of modern neural networks. While existing methods capture complex data
distributions, they often lack interpretability and uncertainty quantification.
Bayesian nonparametric methods, especially the \polya tree, offer a robust
framework that addresses these issues by accurately capturing function behavior
over small intervals. Traditional techniques like Markov chain Monte Carlo
(MCMC) face high computational complexity and scalability limitations,
hindering the use of Bayesian nonparametric methods in deep learning. To tackle
this, we introduce the variational \polya tree (VPT) model, which employs
stochastic variational inference to compute posterior distributions. This model
provides a flexible, nonparametric Bayesian prior that captures latent
densities and works well with stochastic gradient optimization. We also
leverage the joint distribution likelihood for a more precise variational
posterior approximation than traditional mean-field methods. We evaluate the
model performance on both real data and images, and demonstrate its
competitiveness with other state-of-the-art deep density estimation methods. We
also explore its ability in enhancing interpretability and uncertainty
quantification. Code is available at

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across
a spectrum of graph-related tasks, however concerns persist regarding their
vulnerability to adversarial perturbations. While prevailing defense strategies
focus primarily on pre-processing techniques and adaptive message-passing
schemes, this study delves into an under-explored dimension: the impact of
weight initialization and associated hyper-parameters, such as training epochs,
on a model's robustness. We introduce a theoretical framework bridging the
connection between initialization strategies and a network's resilience to
adversarial perturbations. Our analysis reveals a direct relationship between
initial weights, number of training epochs and the model's vulnerability,
offering new insights into adversarial robustness beyond conventional defense
mechanisms. While our primary focus is on GNNs, we extend our theoretical
framework, providing a general upper-bound applicable to Deep Neural Networks.
Extensive experiments, spanning diverse models and real-world datasets
subjected to various adversarial attacks, validate our findings. We illustrate
that selecting appropriate initialization not only ensures performance on clean
datasets but also enhances model robustness against adversarial perturbations,
with observed gaps of up to 50\% compared to alternative initialization
approaches.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决在流式环境、金融交易、多臂老虎机等场景中，需要在有限训练预算下动态选择多个自适应学习算法的问题

Method: 基于UCB风格的元算法M-LCB，使用实际损失构建置信区间，无需额外优化，反映底层专家的收敛特性

Result: 如果每个专家实现内部遗憾Õ(T^α)，则M-LCB确保整体遗憾为Õ(√(KT/M) + (K/M)^{1-α}T^α)

Conclusion: 这是首个在每轮预算约束下同时训练多个自适应专家的遗憾保证结果，将经典老虎机范式扩展到资源有限的状态化自学习专家协调场景

Abstract: In many modern applications, a system must dynamically choose between several
adaptive learning algorithms that are trained online. Examples include model
selection in streaming environments, switching between trading strategies in
finance, and orchestrating multiple contextual bandit or reinforcement learning
agents. At each round, a learner must select one predictor among $K$ adaptive
experts to make a prediction, while being able to update at most $M \le K$ of
them under a fixed training budget.
  We address this problem in the \emph{stochastic setting} and introduce
\algname{M-LCB}, a computationally efficient UCB-style meta-algorithm that
provides \emph{anytime regret guarantees}. Its confidence intervals are built
directly from realized losses, require no additional optimization, and
seamlessly reflect the convergence properties of the underlying experts. If
each expert achieves internal regret $\tilde O(T^\alpha)$, then \algname{M-LCB}
ensures overall regret bounded by $\tilde O\!\Bigl(\sqrt{\tfrac{KT}{M}} \;+\;
(K/M)^{1-\alpha}\,T^\alpha\Bigr)$.
  To our knowledge, this is the first result establishing regret guarantees
when multiple adaptive experts are trained simultaneously under per-round
budget constraints. We illustrate the framework with two representative cases:
(i) parametric models trained online with stochastic losses, and (ii) experts
that are themselves multi-armed bandit algorithms. These examples highlight how
\algname{M-LCB} extends the classical bandit paradigm to the more realistic
scenario of coordinating stateful, self-learning experts under limited
resources.

Result: 在5个时序任务的9个数据集上验证，性能比现有自监督方法提升15-20%。

Conclusion: 无需依赖数据增强就能实现优越性能，为自监督学习提供了新的视角生成方法。

Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for
learning representations without labeled data. Most SSL approaches rely on
strong, well-established, handcrafted data augmentations to generate diverse
views for representation learning. However, designing such augmentations
requires domain-specific knowledge and implicitly imposes representational
invariances on the model, which can limit generalization. In this work, we
propose an unsupervised representation learning method that replaces
augmentations by generating views using orthonormal bases and overcomplete
frames. We show that embeddings learned from orthonormal and overcomplete
spaces reside on distinct manifolds, shaped by the geometric biases introduced
by representing samples in different spaces. By jointly leveraging the
complementary geometry of these distinct manifolds, our approach achieves
superior performance without artificially increasing data diversity through
strong augmentations. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on nine
datasets across five temporal sequence tasks, where signal-specific
characteristics make data augmentations particularly challenging. Without
relying on augmentation-induced diversity, our method achieves performance
gains of up to 15--20\% over existing self-supervised approaches. Source code:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 可靠的价值估计是强化学习的基石，但现有方法如多评论家集成仅结合点估计，分布强化学习依赖离散化或分位数回归，限制了复杂价值分布的表达能力。

Method: FlowCritic采用流匹配技术建模价值分布，通过生成样本进行价值估计，区别于传统的确定性价值预测回归方法。

Result: 该方法能够更有效地表达复杂的价值分布，提升价值估计的可靠性。

Conclusion: 流匹配为价值估计提供了新的生成式范式，有望改善强化学习的收敛速度和最终性能。

Abstract: Reliable value estimation serves as the cornerstone of reinforcement learning
(RL) by evaluating long-term returns and guiding policy improvement,
significantly influencing the convergence speed and final performance. Existing
works improve the reliability of value function estimation via multi-critic
ensembles and distributional RL, yet the former merely combines multi point
estimation without capturing distributional information, whereas the latter
relies on discretization or quantile regression, limiting the expressiveness of
complex value distributions. Inspired by flow matching's success in generative
modeling, we propose a generative paradigm for value estimation, named
FlowCritic. Departing from conventional regression for deterministic value
prediction, FlowCritic leverages flow matching to model value distributions and
generate samples for value estimation.

Abstract: Recovering causal structure in the presence of latent variables is an
important but challenging task. While many methods have been proposed to handle
it, most of them require strict and/or untestable assumptions on the causal
structure. In real-world scenarios, observed variables may be affected by
multiple latent variables simultaneously, which, generally speaking, cannot be
handled by these methods. In this paper, we consider the linear, non-Gaussian
case, and make use of the joint higher-order cumulant matrix of the observed
variables constructed in a specific way. We show that, surprisingly, causal
asymmetry between two observed variables can be directly seen from the rank
deficiency properties of such higher-order cumulant matrices, even in the
presence of an arbitrary number of latent confounders. Identifiability results
are established, and the corresponding identification methods do not even
involve iterative procedures. Experimental results demonstrate the
effectiveness and asymptotic correctness of our proposed method.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学视觉语言模型需要准确的预测和透明的视觉证据对齐，但目前缺乏大规模专家级数据集来捕捉具有精确视觉基础的逐步推理。

Method: 构建S-Chain数据集，包含专家标注的医学图像、边界框和结构化视觉思维链，明确链接视觉区域与推理步骤。

Result: SV-CoT监督显著提高了可解释性、基础保真度和鲁棒性；与检索增强生成协同研究揭示了领域知识和视觉基础在自回归推理中的交互作用。

Conclusion: S-Chain为基于基础的医学推理建立了新基准，为更可信和可解释的医学视觉语言模型铺平了道路。

Abstract: Faithful reasoning in medical vision-language models (VLMs) requires not only
accurate predictions but also transparent alignment between textual rationales
and visual evidence. While Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting has shown promise
in medical visual question answering (VQA), no large-scale expert-level dataset
has captured stepwise reasoning with precise visual grounding. We introduce
S-Chain, the first large-scale dataset of 12,000 expert-annotated medical
images with bounding boxes and structured visual CoT (SV-CoT), explicitly
linking visual regions to reasoning steps. The dataset further supports 16
languages, totaling over 700k VQA pairs for broad multilingual applicability.
Using S-Chain, we benchmark state-of-the-art medical VLMs (ExGra-Med,
LLaVA-Med) and general-purpose VLMs (Qwen2.5-VL, InternVL2.5), showing that
SV-CoT supervision significantly improves interpretability, grounding fidelity,
and robustness. Beyond benchmarking, we study its synergy with
retrieval-augmented generation, revealing how domain knowledge and visual
grounding interact during autoregressive reasoning. Finally, we propose a new
mechanism that strengthens the alignment between visual evidence and reasoning,
improving both reliability and efficiency. S-Chain establishes a new benchmark
for grounded medical reasoning and paves the way toward more trustworthy and
explainable medical VLMs.

Abstract: We observe that current state-of-the-art web-agents are unable to effectively
adapt to new environments without neural network fine-tuning, without which
they produce inefficient execution plans due to a lack of awareness of the
structure and dynamics of the new environment. To address this limitation, we
introduce ATLAS (Actor-Critic Task-completion with Look-ahead Action
Simulation), a memory-augmented agent that is able to make plans grounded in a
model of the environment by simulating the consequences of those actions in
cognitive space. Our agent starts by building a "cognitive map" by performing a
lightweight curiosity driven exploration of the environment. The planner
proposes candidate actions; the simulator predicts their consequences in
cognitive space; a critic analyzes the options to select the best roll-out and
update the original plan; and a browser executor performs the chosen action. On
the WebArena-Lite Benchmark, we achieve a 63% success rate compared to 53.9%
success rate for the previously published state-of-the-art. Unlike previous
systems, our modular architecture requires no website-specific LLM fine-tuning.
Ablations show sizable drops without the world-model, hierarchical planner, and
look-ahead-based replanner confirming their complementary roles within the
design of our system

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统GP-BO在DBMS自动调优中存在基本假设被广泛违反的问题，而现有树集成BO虽然能避免这些假设陷阱，但在不确定性估计和梯度提升技术应用方面仍有局限。

Method: Centrum采用两阶段学习的随机梯度提升集成方法改进代理建模中的分布无关点估计和区间估计，并使用广义SGBE估计的局部自适应保形预测来实现分布无关的不确定性估计和采集函数。

Result: 在两个DBMS和三个工作负载上的大量物理和模拟实验表明，Centrum在21种最先进方法中表现最优。

Conclusion: Centrum是首个实现分布无关性的自动调优器，显著提升了BO在DBMS自动调优中的实用性，并首次无缝融合了梯度提升集成和保形推理。

Abstract: Gaussian-Process-based Bayesian optimization (GP-BO), is a prevailing
model-based framework for DBMS auto-tuning. However, recent work shows
GP-BO-based DBMS auto-tuners significantly outperformed auto-tuners based on
SMAC, which features random forest surrogate models; such results motivate us
to rethink and investigate the limitations of GP-BO in auto-tuner design. We
find the fundamental assumptions of GP-BO are widely violated when modeling and
optimizing DBMS performance, while tree-ensemble-BOs (e.g., SMAC) can avoid the
assumption pitfalls and deliver improved tuning efficiency and effectiveness.
Moreover, we argue that existing tree-ensemble-BOs restrict further advancement
in DBMS auto-tuning. First, existing tree-ensemble-BOs can only achieve
distribution-free point estimates, but still impose unrealistic distributional
assumptions on uncertainty estimates, compromising surrogate modeling and
distort the acquisition function. Second, recent advances in gradient boosting,
which can further enhance surrogate modeling against vanilla GP and random
forest counterparts, have rarely been applied in optimizing DBMS auto-tuners.
To address these issues, we propose a novel model-based DBMS auto-tuner,
Centrum. Centrum improves distribution-free point and interval estimation in
surrogate modeling with a two-phase learning procedure of stochastic gradient
boosting ensembles. Moreover, Centrum adopts a generalized SGBE-estimated
locally-adaptive conformal prediction to facilitate a distribution-free
uncertainty estimation and acquisition function. To our knowledge, Centrum is
the first auto-tuner to realize distribution-freeness, enhancing BO's
practicality in DBMS auto-tuning, and the first to seamlessly fuse gradient
boosting ensembles and conformal inference in BO. Extensive physical and
simulation experiments on two DBMSs and three workloads show Centrum
outperforms 21 SOTA methods.

Result: 理论证明了D-DRO的平稳收敛性能，在机器学习预测任务中实证展示了其优越的分布外泛化性能。

Conclusion: 扩散模型为DRO提供了有效的模糊集设计方法，能够捕捉超出名义支撑空间的对抗分布，同时保持可处理性，显著提升OOD泛化能力。

Abstract: This paper studies Distributionally Robust Optimization (DRO), a fundamental
framework for enhancing the robustness and generalization of statistical
learning and optimization. An effective ambiguity set for DRO must involve
distributions that remain consistent with the nominal distribution while being
diverse enough to account for a variety of potential scenarios. Moreover, it
should lead to tractable DRO solutions. To this end, we propose a
diffusion-based ambiguity set design that captures various adversarial
distributions beyond the nominal support space while maintaining consistency
with the nominal distribution. Building on this ambiguity modeling, we propose
Diffusion-based DRO (D-DRO), a tractable DRO algorithm that solves the inner
maximization over the parameterized diffusion model space. We formally
establish the stationary convergence performance of D-DRO and empirically
demonstrate its superior Out-of-Distribution (OOD) generalization performance
in a ML prediction task.

Motivation: 现有的层剪枝方法通常需要重新训练，且不能保证任务性能的提升。TALE旨在通过直接优化任务性能来实现无需重新训练的层剪枝。

Method: TALE在推理时根据任务特定验证性能直接剪枝Transformer层，通过选择性移除瓶颈层来优化模型。

Result: 在9个任务和5个模型上的评估显示，TALE在零样本和少样本设置下均能提升准确率并降低计算成本，且在微调过程中应用能带来额外性能增益。

Conclusion: TALE提供了一种无需重新训练的有效层剪枝方法，能够生成更小、更快、更准确的模型，并为Transformer可解释性提供新见解。

Abstract: In this paper we introduce Tale, Task-Aware Layer Elimination, an
inference-time algorithm that prunes entire transformer layers in an LLM by
directly optimizing task-specific validation performance. We evaluate TALE on 9
tasks and 5 models, including LLaMA 3.1 8B, Qwen 2.5 7B, Qwen 2.5 0.5B, Mistral
7B, and Lucie 7B, under both zero-shot and few-shot settings. Unlike prior
approaches, TALE requires no retraining and consistently improves accuracy
while reducing computational cost across all benchmarks. Furthermore, applying
TALE during finetuning leads to additional performance gains. Finally, TALE
provides flexible user control over trade-offs between accuracy and efficiency.
Mutual information analysis shows that certain layers act as bottlenecks,
degrading task-relevant representations. Tale's selective layer removal
remedies this problem, producing smaller, faster, and more accurate models that
are also faster to fine-tune while offering new insights into transformer
interpretability.

TL;DR: 提出了SeeDNorm动态归一化方法，通过基于当前输入动态调整缩放系数来增强模型表示能力，相比RMSNorm能保留输入范数信息，在各种任务中表现优于RMSNorm、LayerNorm等方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RMSNorm丢弃了输入范数信息，静态缩放因子无法适应输入数据的广泛变化和分布偏移，限制了模型性能提升，特别是在大语言模型的零样本场景中。

Method: SeeDNorm通过动态调整缩放系数来保留输入范数信息，实现数据依赖的自重缩放动态归一化，同时在反向传播中保持RMSNorm根据输入范数动态调整梯度的能力。

Result: 在不同规模的大语言模型预训练以及监督和无监督计算机视觉任务中，SeeDNorm均表现出优于RMSNorm、LayerNorm和DyT等方法的性能，且仅引入少量参数，对模型效率影响可忽略。

Conclusion: SeeDNorm通过动态缩放机制有效提升了归一化层的表示能力，在各种任务中实现了持续优越的性能，为解决归一化层在动态场景中的局限性提供了有效方案。

Abstract: Normalization layer constitutes an essential component in neural networks. In
transformers, the predominantly used RMSNorm constrains vectors to a unit
hypersphere, followed by dimension-wise rescaling through a learnable scaling
coefficient $\gamma$ to maintain the representational capacity of the model.
However, RMSNorm discards the input norm information in forward pass and a
static scaling factor $\gamma$ may be insufficient to accommodate the wide
variability of input data and distributional shifts, thereby limiting further
performance improvements, particularly in zero-shot scenarios that large
language models routinely encounter. To address this limitation, we propose
SeeDNorm, which enhances the representational capability of the model by
dynamically adjusting the scaling coefficient based on the current input,
thereby preserving the input norm information and enabling data-dependent,
self-rescaled dynamic normalization. During backpropagation, SeeDNorm retains
the ability of RMSNorm to dynamically adjust gradient according to the input
norm. We provide a detailed analysis of the training optimization for SeedNorm
and proposed corresponding solutions to address potential instability issues
that may arise when applying SeeDNorm. We validate the effectiveness of
SeeDNorm across models of varying sizes in large language model pre-training as
well as supervised and unsupervised computer vision tasks. By introducing a
minimal number of parameters and with neglligible impact on model efficiency,
SeeDNorm achieves consistently superior performance compared to previously
commonly used normalization layers such as RMSNorm and LayerNorm, as well as
element-wise activation alternatives to normalization layers like DyT.

TL;DR: NBF-Rec是一个基于图的推荐模型，支持在用户和物品集不相交的数据集之间进行归纳迁移学习，无需重新训练即可在新领域应用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于图的推荐系统通常在转导设置下训练，限制了其对新用户、新物品或新数据集的适用性。

Method: NBF-Rec在推理时动态计算节点嵌入，使用交互级消息传递，支持零样本设置和轻量级微调。

Conclusion: 基于图的推荐中的归纳迁移是可行的，交互级消息传递支持跨数据集泛化，无需对齐的用户或物品。

Abstract: Graph-based recommender systems are commonly trained in transductive
settings, which limits their applicability to new users, items, or datasets. We
propose NBF-Rec, a graph-based recommendation model that supports inductive
transfer learning across datasets with disjoint user and item sets. Unlike
conventional embedding-based methods that require retraining for each domain,
NBF-Rec computes node embeddings dynamically at inference time. We evaluate the
method on seven real-world datasets spanning movies, music, e-commerce, and
location check-ins. NBF-Rec achieves competitive performance in zero-shot
settings, where no target domain data is used for training, and demonstrates
further improvements through lightweight fine-tuning. These results show that
inductive transfer is feasible in graph-based recommendation and that

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出基于信息论中惊奇度（surprisal）的无模型机器学习框架，通过不确定性量化相关性，实现生成推理、因果发现、异常检测和时间序列预测等多种任务，性能接近SOTA且保持可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统机器学习依赖显式模型和领域假设，限制了灵活性和可解释性。需要一种能够直接从原始数据进行分析和推理的无模型方法，消除分布建模，减少偏差，并支持高效的数据更新。

Method: 使用惊奇度（信息论不确定性）作为核心工具，通过量化相关性来驱动推理过程。该方法不需要分布建模，支持直接编辑和删除训练数据，强调可追溯性和数据驱动决策。

Result: 在生成推理、因果发现、异常检测和时间序列预测等常见机器学习任务中达到或接近最先进性能，能够有效处理复杂数据类型（包括缺失数据）。

Conclusion: 该方法为可扩展机器学习和人工智能提供了一条可行的替代路径，既保持了神经网络的可扩展性，又维持了底层机制的人类可理解性，创建了信息的"物理学"基础。

Abstract: Traditional machine learning relies on explicit models and domain
assumptions, limiting flexibility and interpretability. We introduce a
model-free framework using surprisal (information theoretic uncertainty) to
directly analyze and perform inferences from raw data, eliminating distribution
modeling, reducing bias, and enabling efficient updates including direct edits
and deletion of training data. By quantifying relevance through uncertainty,
the approach enables generalizable inference across tasks including generative
inference, causal discovery, anomaly detection, and time series forecasting. It
emphasizes traceability, interpretability, and data-driven decision making,
offering a unified, human-understandable framework for machine learning, and
achieves at or near state-of-the-art performance across most common machine
learning tasks. The mathematical foundations create a ``physics'' of
information, which enable these techniques to apply effectively to a wide
variety of complex data types, including missing data. Empirical results
indicate that this may be a viable alternative path to neural networks with
regard to scalable machine learning and artificial intelligence that can
maintain human understandability of the underlying mechanics.

Conclusion: 所提算法在异构奖励分布式多臂老虎机问题中实现了优越性能，理论分析和数值实验验证了算法有效性，并阐明了通信图特性对遗憾的影响。

Abstract: We study the distributed multi-agent multi-armed bandit problem with
heterogeneous rewards over random communication graphs. Uniquely, at each time
step $t$ agents communicate over a time-varying random graph $G_t$ generated by
applying the Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi model to a fixed connected base graph $G$ (for
classical Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi graphs, $G$ is a complete graph), where each
potential edge in $G$ is randomly and independently present with the link
probability $p$. Notably, the resulting random graph is not necessarily
connected at each time step. Each agent's arm rewards follow time-invariant
distributions, and the reward distribution for the same arm may differ across
agents. The goal is to minimize the cumulative expected regret relative to the
global mean reward of each arm, defined as the average of that arm's mean
rewards across all agents. To this end, we propose a fully distributed
algorithm that integrates the arm elimination strategy with the random gossip
algorithm. We theoretically show that the regret upper bound is of order $\log
T$ and is highly interpretable, where $T$ is the time horizon. It includes the
optimal centralized regret $O\left(\sum_{k: \Delta_k>0} \frac{\log
T}{\Delta_k}\right)$ and an additional term $O\left(\frac{N^2 \log T}{p
\lambda_{N-1}(Lap(G))} + \frac{KN^2 \log T}{p}\right)$ where $N$ and $K$ denote
the total number of agents and arms, respectively. This term reflects the
impact of $G$'s algebraic connectivity $\lambda_{N-1}(Lap(G))$ and the link
probability $p$, and thus highlights a fundamental trade-off between
communication efficiency and regret. As a by-product, we show a nearly optimal
regret lower bound. Finally, our numerical experiments not only show the
superiority of our algorithm over existing benchmarks, but also validate the
theoretical regret scaling with problem complexity.

*Soham Pahari,Sandeep Chand Kumain*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出一种混合预测框架，结合LOESS分解、ARIMA建模和多尺度CNN-BiLSTM网络，用于印度大城市的空气质量指数预测，在PM2.5、O3、CO和NOx等污染物上表现优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 印度大城市空气污染严重，污染物水平突然飙升难以及时干预。AQI预测因同时存在线性趋势、季节变化和波动非线性模式而具有挑战性。

Method: 使用LOESS将AQI序列分解为趋势、季节和残差分量，ARIMA建模平滑分量，提出的深度学习模块捕捉残差中的多尺度波动。模型超参数通过UAMMO优化器调整。

Result: 在2021-2023年AQI数据集上的实验表明，该方法在所有污染物上均优于统计、深度学习和混合基线方法，MSE降低5-8%，R²得分>0.94。

Conclusion: 该框架具有鲁棒性，对突发污染事件敏感，适用于城市空气质量管理的实际应用。

Abstract: Air pollution remains a critical environmental and public health concern in
Indian megacities such as Delhi, Kolkata, and Mumbai, where sudden spikes in
pollutant levels challenge timely intervention. Accurate Air Quality Index
(AQI) forecasting is difficult due to the coexistence of linear trends,
seasonal variations, and volatile nonlinear patterns. This paper proposes a
hybrid forecasting framework that integrates LOESS decomposition, ARIMA
modeling, and a multi-scale CNN-BiLSTM network with a residual-gated attention
mechanism. The LOESS step separates the AQI series into trend, seasonal, and
residual components, with ARIMA modeling the smooth components and the proposed
deep learning module capturing multi-scale volatility in the residuals. Model
hyperparameters are tuned via the Unified Adaptive Multi-Stage Metaheuristic
Optimizer (UAMMO), combining multiple optimization strategies for efficient
convergence. Experiments on 2021-2023 AQI datasets from the Central Pollution
Control Board show that the proposed method consistently outperforms
statistical, deep learning, and hybrid baselines across PM2.5, O3, CO, and NOx
in three major cities, achieving up to 5-8% lower MSE and higher R^2 scores
(>0.94) for all pollutants. These results demonstrate the framework's
robustness, sensitivity to sudden pollution events, and applicability to urban
air quality management.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文分析了BOBW FTRL算法在赌博机问题中的最后迭代收敛性，证明了使用特定正则函数时，最优臂与算法分布之间的Bregman散度以t^{-1/2}速率衰减。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在线学习算法的收敛分析对机器学习理论很重要，特别是最后迭代收敛能捕捉学习者的实际决策。但在多臂赌博机中，现有分析主要关注遗憾阶数，最后迭代收敛率研究较少，尤其是广泛使用的FTRL算法。

Method: 使用与BOBW FTRL算法1/2-Tsallis-INF相关的正则函数Ψ(p)=-4∑√p_i，分析Bregman散度在最优臂点质量与算法分布之间的衰减速率。

Result: 理论分析表明，Bregman散度以t^{-1/2}的速率衰减，部分证实了对数遗憾对应t^{-1}最后迭代收敛速率的直觉。

Conclusion: 本文首次研究了BOBW FTRL算法在赌博机问题中的最后迭代收敛性，为理解这类算法的动态行为提供了理论保证。

Abstract: The convergence analysis of online learning algorithms is central to machine
learning theory, where last-iterate convergence is particularly important, as
it captures the learner's actual decisions and describes the evolution of the
learning process over time. However, in multi-armed bandits, most existing
algorithmic analyses mainly focus on the order of regret, while the
last-iterate (simple regret) convergence rate remains less explored --
especially for the widely studied Follow-the-Regularized-Leader (FTRL)
algorithms. Recently, a growing line of work has established the
Best-of-Both-Worlds (BOBW) property of FTRL algorithms in bandit problems,
showing in particular that they achieve logarithmic regret in stochastic
bandits. Nevertheless, their last-iterate convergence rate has not yet been
studied. Intuitively, logarithmic regret should correspond to a $t^{-1}$
last-iterate convergence rate. This paper partially confirms this intuition
through theoretical analysis, showing that the Bregman divergence, defined by
the regular function $\Psi(p)=-4\sum_{i=1}^{d}\sqrt{p_i}$ associated with the
BOBW FTRL algorithm $1/2$-Tsallis-INF (arXiv:1807.07623), between the point
mass on the optimal arm and the probability distribution over the arm set
obtained at iteration $t$, decays at a rate of $t^{-1/2}$.

Motivation: 结合GAN的不可区分性和逻辑解释性，在有限逻辑深度约束下实现可解释的生成对抗学习，提供可控制的逻辑边界生成。

Method: 使用深度k的EF对手作为判别器搜索逻辑故障，生成器作为构建者产生能通过k轮EF匹配的样本，结合逻辑损失函数和课程学习。

Conclusion: LOGAN提供了一条紧凑、可复现的逻辑边界生成路径，具有可解释的失败、经过验证的有效性（模拟和真实训练）以及可调节的控制参数。

Abstract: GANs promise indistinguishability, logic explains it. We put the two on a
budget: a discriminator that can only ``see'' up to a logical depth $k$, and a
generator that must look correct to that bounded observer. \textbf{LOGAN}
(LOGical GANs) casts the discriminator as a depth-$k$ Ehrenfeucht--Fra\"iss\'e
(EF) \emph{Opponent} that searches for small, legible faults (odd cycles,
nonplanar crossings, directed bridges), while the generator plays
\emph{Builder}, producing samples that admit a $k$-round matching to a target
theory $T$. We ship a minimal toolkit -- an EF-probe simulator and MSO-style
graph checkers -- and four experiments including real neural GAN training with
PyTorch. Beyond verification, we score samples with a \emph{logical loss} that
mixes budgeted EF round-resilience with cheap certificate terms, enabling a
practical curriculum on depth. Framework validation demonstrates $92\%$--$98\%$
property satisfaction via simulation (Exp.~3), while real neural GAN training
achieves $5\%$--$14\%$ improvements on challenging properties and $98\%$
satisfaction on connectivity (matching simulation) through adversarial learning
(Exp.~4). LOGAN is a compact, reproducible path toward logic-bounded generation
with interpretable failures, proven effectiveness (both simulated and real
training), and dials for control.

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于单细胞RNA测序数据的潜在即插即用扩散框架，通过分离观测空间和去噪空间来提高聚类准确性，具有自适应噪声处理、不确定性量化和可泛化去噪等优势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 单细胞RNA测序数据存在测量噪声和生物变异性，导致在标准潜在空间中不同细胞类型的数据可能投影得很近，使得准确聚类变得困难。

Method: 引入潜在即插即用扩散框架，通过新颖的Gibbs采样程序分离观测空间和去噪空间：在低维潜在空间应用学习到的扩散先验进行去噪，同时在原始高维观测空间重新引入噪声来引导该过程。

Result: 在合成数据上，该方法在不同噪声水平和数据集偏移下提高了聚类准确性；在真实单细胞数据上，产生的细胞簇具有更好的生物学一致性，簇边界与已知细胞类型标记和发育轨迹更吻合。

Conclusion: 该方法通过独特的"输入空间引导"机制，确保去噪轨迹忠实于原始数据结构，为单细胞数据分析提供了更可靠的聚类结果和生物学解释。

Abstract: Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) enables the study of cellular
heterogeneity. Yet, clustering accuracy, and with it downstream analyses based
on cell labels, remain challenging due to measurement noise and biological
variability. In standard latent spaces (e.g., obtained through PCA), data from
different cell types can be projected close together, making accurate
clustering difficult. We introduce a latent plug-and-play diffusion framework
that separates the observation and denoising space. This separation is
operationalized through a novel Gibbs sampling procedure: the learned diffusion
prior is applied in a low-dimensional latent space to perform denoising, while
to steer this process, noise is reintroduced into the original high-dimensional
observation space. This unique "input-space steering" ensures the denoising
trajectory remains faithful to the original data structure. Our approach offers
three key advantages: (1) adaptive noise handling via a tunable balance between
prior and observed data; (2) uncertainty quantification through principled
uncertainty estimates for downstream analysis; and (3) generalizable denoising
by leveraging clean reference data to denoise noisier datasets, and via
averaging, improve quality beyond the training set. We evaluate robustness on
both synthetic and real single-cell genomics data. Our method improves
clustering accuracy on synthetic data across varied noise levels and dataset
shifts. On real-world single-cell data, our method demonstrates improved
biological coherence in the resulting cell clusters, with cluster boundaries
that better align with known cell type markers and developmental trajectories.

TL;DR: 提出了一个物理信息机器学习框架，用于建模和预测随机FitzHugh-Nagumo神经元中的自诱导随机共振现象，通过将随机微分方程和物理约束嵌入神经网络，实现了对噪声诱导相干性的准确预测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法需要大量计算资源进行随机模拟，而纯数据驱动方法在准确性和泛化能力方面存在不足，需要开发数据高效且可解释的替代模型来模拟和分析多尺度随机系统中的噪声诱导相干性。

Method: 基于噪声增强状态预测器架构的物理信息神经网络，将控制随机微分方程和SISR渐近时间尺度匹配约束直接嵌入网络，复合损失函数整合了数据保真度、动力学残差和基于Kramers逃逸理论的物理约束。

Result: 训练后的PINN能够准确预测尖峰序列相干性对噪声强度、兴奋性和时间尺度分离的依赖关系，与直接随机模拟结果匹配，在准确性和泛化能力方面相比纯数据驱动方法有显著提升，同时计算需求大幅减少。

Conclusion: 该框架为模拟和分析多尺度随机系统中的噪声诱导相干性提供了一个数据高效且可解释的替代模型，在神经科学和复杂系统研究中具有重要应用价值。

Abstract: Self-induced stochastic resonance (SISR) is the emergence of coherent
oscillations in slow-fast excitable systems driven solely by noise, without
external periodic forcing or proximity to a bifurcation. This work presents a
physics-informed machine learning framework for modeling and predicting SISR in
the stochastic FitzHugh-Nagumo neuron. We embed the governing stochastic
differential equations and SISR-asymptotic timescale-matching constraints
directly into a Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) based on a
Noise-Augmented State Predictor architecture. The composite loss integrates
data fidelity, dynamical residuals, and barrier-based physical constraints
derived from Kramers' escape theory. The trained PINN accurately predicts the
dependence of spike-train coherence on noise intensity, excitability, and
timescale separation, matching results from direct stochastic simulations with
substantial improvements in accuracy and generalization compared with purely
data-driven methods, while requiring significantly less computation. The
framework provides a data-efficient and interpretable surrogate model for
simulating and analyzing noise-induced coherence in multiscale stochastic
systems.

Conclusion: E2D2框架通过专门的编码器-解码器架构和训练采样算法，显著提升了离散扩散模型的推理效率。

Abstract: Discrete diffusion models enable parallel token sampling for faster inference
than autoregressive approaches. However, prior diffusion models use a
decoder-only architecture, which requires sampling algorithms that invoke the
full network at every denoising step and incur high computational cost. Our key
insight is that discrete diffusion models perform two types of computation: 1)
representing clean tokens and 2) denoising corrupted tokens, which enables us
to use separate modules for each task. We propose an encoder-decoder
architecture to accelerate discrete diffusion inference, which relies on an
encoder to represent clean tokens and a lightweight decoder to iteratively
refine a noised sequence. We also show that this architecture enables faster
training of block diffusion models, which partition sequences into blocks for
better quality and are commonly used in diffusion language model inference. We
introduce a framework for Efficient Encoder-Decoder Diffusion (E2D2),
consisting of an architecture with specialized training and sampling
algorithms, and we show that E2D2 achieves superior trade-offs between
generation quality and inference throughput on summarization, translation, and
mathematical reasoning tasks. We provide the code, model weights, and blog post

Abstract: Precipitation prediction has undergone a profound transformation -- from
early symbolic and empirical methods rooted in divination and observation, to
modern technologies based on atmospheric physics and artificial intelligence.
This review traces the historical and technological evolution of precipitation
forecasting, presenting a survey about end-to-end precipitation prediction
technologies that spans ancient practices, the foundations of meteorological

traditional and indigenous forecasting methods, then describe the development
of physical modeling and statistical frameworks that underpin contemporary
operational forecasting. Particular emphasis is placed on recent advances in
neural network-based approaches, including automated deep learning,
interpretability-driven design, and hybrid physical-data models. By compositing
research across multiple eras and paradigms, this review not only depicts the
history of end-to-end precipitation prediction but also outlines future

Motivation: 解决混合离线-在线强化学习中因离线数据和在线数据分布偏移导致的不稳定性问题，同时保持探索效率和安全性。

Method: 采用解耦设计：奖励寻求的学习器自由探索，基于投影的守护器保证规则一致性执行和安全值备份；提出动态课程学习，逐步扩展时间视野并退火离线-在线数据混合。

Result: 在Atari-100k上实现了3.02的归一化平均分数，比现有混合方法提升45%，在安全性和稳定性方面表现更强；在安全关键和长视野任务上均获得一致增益。

Conclusion: 解耦的安全执行为稳健的混合离线-在线强化学习提供了一条简单而有原则的路径，为协调探索和安全性提出了更广泛的范式。

Abstract: Hybrid offline--online reinforcement learning (O2O RL) promises both sample
efficiency and robust exploration, but suffers from instability due to
distribution shift between offline and online data. We introduce RLPD-GX, a
framework that decouples policy optimization from safety enforcement: a
reward-seeking learner explores freely, while a projection-based guardian
guarantees rule-consistent execution and safe value backups. This design
preserves the exploratory value of online interactions without collapsing to
conservative policies. To further stabilize training, we propose dynamic
curricula that gradually extend temporal horizons and anneal offline--online
data mixing. We prove convergence via a contraction property of the guarded
Bellman operator, and empirically show state-of-the-art performance on
Atari-100k, achieving a normalized mean score of 3.02 (+45\% over prior hybrid
methods) with stronger safety and stability. Beyond Atari, ablations
demonstrate consistent gains across safety-critical and long-horizon tasks,
underscoring the generality of our design. Extensive and comprehensive results
highlight decoupled safety enforcement as a simple yet principled route to
robust O2O RL, suggesting a broader paradigm for reconciling exploration and
safety in reinforcement learning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习方法在PM2.5浓度预测中难以维持48小时以上的预测稳定性，特别是在监测网络稀疏的城市中，这限制了公共卫生预警系统的有效性。

Method: 结合动态时间规整进行智能站点相似性选择，使用轻量级CNN-GRU架构并增强气象特征，设计适用于稀疏网络的扩展架构。

Result: 在8个监测站的多年度小时数据验证中，24小时预测R²达到0.91，首次实现稳定的10天PM2.5预测（240小时R²=0.73），且无性能衰减。

Conclusion: 该框架计算效率高且不依赖外部工具，特别适合在资源受限的城市环境中部署，满足了关键预警系统需求。

Abstract: Reliable long-term forecasting of PM2.5 concentrations is critical for public
health early-warning systems, yet existing deep learning approaches struggle to
maintain prediction stability beyond 48 hours, especially in cities with sparse
monitoring networks. This paper presents a deep learning framework that
combines Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) for intelligent station similarity
selection with a CNN-GRU architecture to enable extended-horizon PM2.5
forecasting in Isfahan, Iran, a city characterized by complex pollution
dynamics and limited monitoring coverage. Unlike existing approaches that rely
on computationally intensive transformer models or external simulation tools,
our method integrates three key innovations: (i) DTW-based historical sampling
to identify similar pollution patterns across peer stations, (ii) a lightweight
CNN-GRU architecture augmented with meteorological features, and (iii) a
scalable design optimized for sparse networks. Experimental validation using
multi-year hourly data from eight monitoring stations demonstrates superior
performance compared to state-of-the-art deep learning methods, achieving R2 =
0.91 for 24-hour forecasts. Notably, this is the first study to demonstrate
stable 10-day PM2.5 forecasting (R2 = 0.73 at 240 hours) without performance
degradation, addressing critical early-warning system requirements. The
framework's computational efficiency and independence from external tools make
it particularly suitable for deployment in resource-constrained urban
environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 近期研究未经严格验证就将基础模型用于表型发现，可能产生表面真实但临床不连贯的嵌入表示，需要测试这种不匹配现象。

Method: 在HIV抗逆转录病毒治疗和急性低血压数据集上训练了两个自回归模型（序列到序列LSTM和简化Transformer），训练时添加随机访视间隔以引入可控不规则性，测试序列保持完整。

Result: 两个模型都能复现特征分布，但未能保持跨特征结构，表明生成式预训练产生局部真实性但临床一致性有限。

Conclusion: 结果强调了领域特定评估的必要性，并支持将轨迹合成作为微调或部署前的实用探针。

Abstract: Foundation models refer to architectures trained on vast datasets using
autoregressive pre-training from natural language processing to capture
intricate patterns and motifs. They were originally developed to transfer such
learned knowledge to downstream predictive tasks. Recently, however, some
studies repurpose these learned representations for phenotype discovery without
rigorous validation, risking superficially realistic but clinically incoherent
embeddings. To test this mismatch, we trained two autoregressive models -- a
sequence-to-sequence LSTM and a reduced Transformer -- on longitudinal ART for
HIV and Acute Hypotension datasets. Controlled irregularity was added during
training via random inter-visit gaps, while test sequences stayed complete.
Patient-trajectory synthesis evaluated distributional and correlational
fidelity. Both reproduced feature distributions but failed to preserve
cross-feature structure -- showing that generative pre-training yields local
realism but limited clinical coherence. These results highlight the need for
domain-specific evaluation and support trajectory synthesis as a practical
probe before fine-tuning or deployment.

Conclusion: 该方法通过客户端嵌入控制有效解决了多模态联邦学习中的数据缺失和异构问题，理论分析和实证结果均验证了其有效性。

Abstract: Multimodal federated learning in real-world settings often encounters
incomplete and heterogeneous data across clients. This results in misaligned
local feature representations that limit the effectiveness of model
aggregation. Unlike prior work that assumes either differing modality sets
without missing input features or a shared modality set with missing features
across clients, we consider a more general and realistic setting where each
client observes a different subset of modalities and might also have missing
input features within each modality. To address the resulting misalignment in
learned representations, we propose a new federated learning framework
featuring locally adaptive representations based on learnable client-side
embedding controls that encode each client's data-missing patterns.
  These embeddings serve as reconfiguration signals that align the globally
aggregated representation with each client's local context, enabling more
effective use of shared information. Furthermore, the embedding controls can be
algorithmically aggregated across clients with similar data-missing patterns to
enhance the robustness of reconfiguration signals in adapting the global
representation. Empirical results on multiple federated multimodal benchmarks

the proposed method, achieving up to 36.45\% performance improvement under

*Saeed Najafi,Alona Fyshe*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于最大边际似然(MML)的新对齐方法MMPO，通过最大化偏好文本输出的边际对数似然来对齐大语言模型，无需显式奖励模型和熵最大化，在稳定性和性能上优于传统RLHF方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的人类反馈强化学习(RLHF)方法复杂且不稳定，需要寻找更简单有效的大语言模型对齐方法。

Method: 基于最大边际似然估计，提出MMPO方法，使用偏好对作为样本近似，最大化偏好文本的边际对数似然，无需显式奖励模型和熵最大化。

Result: 在135M到8B参数模型上的实验表明，MMPO在超参数β方面更稳定，在偏好对齐方面具有竞争力或更优，同时更好地保留了基础模型的通用语言能力。

Conclusion: MMPO通过梯度更新中的隐式偏好优化实现了改进的性能，为LLM对齐提供了一种更简单稳定的替代方案。

Abstract: Aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with human preferences is crucial, but
standard methods like Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) are
often complex and unstable. In this work, we propose a new, simpler approach
that recasts alignment through the lens of Maximum Marginal Likelihood (MML)
estimation. Our new MML based Preference Optimization (MMPO) maximizes the
marginal log-likelihood of a preferred text output, using the preference pair
as samples for approximation, and forgoes the need for both an explicit reward
model and entropy maximization. We theoretically demonstrate that MMPO
implicitly performs preference optimization, producing a weighted gradient that
naturally up-weights chosen responses over rejected ones. Across models ranging
from 135M to 8B parameters, we empirically show that MMPO: 1) is more stable
with respect to the hyperparameter $\beta$ compared to alternative baselines,
and 2) achieves competitive or superior preference alignment while better
preserving the base model's general language capabilities. Through a series of
ablation experiments, we show that this improved performance is indeed
attributable to MMPO's implicit preference optimization within the gradient
updates.

TL;DR: 本研究探索使用AI语言检测方法自动化语言景观分析，在火奴鲁鲁唐人街案例中构建了1449张地理参考照片数据集，应用OCR和语言分类，总体准确率达79%，识别了五类常见错误标签。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统语言景观研究依赖人工拍摄和标注公共标识，过程耗时且难以处理大面积研究区域，需要探索自动化方法来提高效率。

Method: 构建地理参考照片数据集，应用AI进行光学字符识别和语言分类，并进行人工验证以检查准确性。

Result: AI模型总体准确率为79%，识别出五类常见错误标签：扭曲、反光、表面退化、涂鸦和幻觉。模型对所有图像区域平等对待，会检测人类通常忽略的边缘或背景文字。

Conclusion: 尽管存在局限性，AI辅助工作流程有潜力减少语言景观研究中的耗时过程，但AI不能完全信任，建议采用AI自动化与人工验证相结合的混合方法。

Abstract: Linguistic Landscape (LL) research traditionally relies on manual photography
and annotation of public signages to examine distribution of languages in urban
space. While such methods yield valuable findings, the process is
time-consuming and difficult for large study areas. This study explores the use
of AI powered language detection method to automate LL analysis. Using Honolulu
Chinatown as a case study, we constructed a georeferenced photo dataset of
1,449 images collected by researchers and applied AI for optical character
recognition (OCR) and language classification. We also conducted manual
validations for accuracy checking. This model achieved an overall accuracy of
79%. Five recurring types of mislabeling were identified, including distortion,
reflection, degraded surface, graffiti, and hallucination. The analysis also
reveals that the AI model treats all regions of an image equally, detecting
peripheral or background texts that human interpreters typically ignore.
Despite these limitations, the results demonstrate the potential of integrating
AI-assisted workflows into LL research to reduce such time-consuming processes.
However, due to all the limitations and mis-labels, we recognize that AI cannot
be fully trusted during this process. This paper encourages a hybrid approach
combining AI automation with human validation for a more reliable and efficient
workflow.

Abstract: Natural disasters, such as volcanic eruptions, pose significant challenges to
daily life and incur considerable global economic losses. The emergence of
next-generation small-satellites, capable of constellation-based operations,
offers unparalleled opportunities for near-real-time monitoring and onboard
processing of such events. However, a major bottleneck remains the lack of
extensive annotated datasets capturing volcanic activity, which hinders the
development of robust detection systems. This paper introduces a novel dataset
explicitly designed for volcanic activity and eruption detection, encompassing
diverse volcanoes worldwide. The dataset provides binary annotations to
identify volcanic anomalies or non-anomalies, covering phenomena such as
temperature anomalies, eruptions, and volcanic ash emissions. These annotations
offer a foundational resource for developing and evaluating detection models,
addressing a critical gap in volcanic monitoring research. Additionally, we
present comprehensive benchmarks using state-of-the-art models to establish
baselines for future studies. Furthermore, we explore the potential for
deploying these models onboard next-generation satellites. Using the Intel
Movidius Myriad X VPU as a testbed, we demonstrate the feasibility of volcanic
activity detection directly onboard. This capability significantly reduces
latency and enhances response times, paving the way for advanced early warning
systems. This paves the way for innovative solutions in volcanic disaster
management, encouraging further exploration and refinement of onboard
monitoring technologies.

Conclusion: 研究不仅提升了子图匹配性能，还揭示了图表示和交互的通用设计原则，具有更广泛的应用价值。

Abstract: Subgraph matching is vital in knowledge graph (KG) question answering,
molecule design, scene graph, code and circuit search, etc. Neural methods have
shown promising results for subgraph matching. Our study of recent systems
suggests refactoring them into a unified design space for graph matching
networks. Existing methods occupy only a few isolated patches in this space,
which remains largely uncharted. We undertake the first comprehensive
exploration of this space, featuring such axes as attention-based vs. soft
permutation-based interaction between query and corpus graphs, aligning nodes
vs. edges, and the form of the final scoring network that integrates neural
representations of the graphs. Our extensive experiments reveal that judicious
and hitherto-unexplored combinations of choices in this space lead to large
performance benefits. Beyond better performance, our study uncovers valuable
insights and establishes general design principles for neural graph
representation and interaction, which may be of wider interest.

Abstract: We investigate the role of network architecture in shaping the inductive
biases of modern score-based generative models. To this end, we introduce the
Score Anisotropy Directions (SADs), architecture-dependent directions that
reveal how different networks preferentially capture data structure. Our
analysis shows that SADs form adaptive bases aligned with the architecture's
output geometry, providing a principled way to predict generalization ability
in score models prior to training. Through both synthetic data and standard
image benchmarks, we demonstrate that SADs reliably capture fine-grained model
behavior and correlate with downstream performance, as measured by Wasserstein
metrics. Our work offers a new lens for explaining and predicting directional
biases of generative models.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为SSBA的分段采样边界逼近方法，用于在高维空间中生成反事实解释。该方法通过四个步骤：模型拟合、寻找决策边界、确定约束条件、计算最近边界点，能够处理现实世界约束并显著减少距离度量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有反事实解释方法在高维空间中效果有限，难以处理现实世界中的约束条件（如年龄、性别等不可变特征），需要一种能够有效处理这些约束并找到最近可行反事实解释的方法。

Method: 采用分段采样边界逼近(SSBA)方法，使用二分搜索找到决策边界点，然后搜索最近的边界点。该方法能够限制对不可变和分类特征的更改，处理现实世界约束。

Result: 在四个不同维度的数据集上测试，该方法在L2范数距离上比现有方法减少了5%到50%。在运行时间方面，SSBA算法在相同时间内生成的决策边界点数量比基于网格的方法高出多个数量级。

Conclusion: SSBA提供了一种简单有效的模型无关方法，能够计算最近可行（符合现实约束）的反事实解释，适用于高维空间和现实世界约束场景。

Abstract: In our article, we describe a method for generating counterfactual
explanations in high-dimensional spaces using four steps that involve fitting
our dataset to a model, finding the decision boundary, determining constraints
on the problem, and computing the closest point (counterfactual explanation)
from that boundary. We propose a discretized approach where we find many
discrete points on the boundary and then identify the closest feasible
counterfactual explanation. This method, which we later call $\textit{Segmented
Sampling for Boundary Approximation}$ (SSBA), applies binary search to find
decision boundary points and then searches for the closest boundary point.
Across four datasets of varying dimensionality, we show that our method can
outperform current methods for counterfactual generation with reductions in
distance between $5\%$ to $50\%$ in terms of the $L_2$ norm. Our method can
also handle real-world constraints by restricting changes to immutable and
categorical features, such as age, gender, sex, height, and other related
characteristics such as the case for a health-based dataset. In terms of
runtime, the SSBA algorithm generates decision boundary points on multiple
orders of magnitude in the same given time when we compare to a grid-based
approach. In general, our method provides a simple and effective model-agnostic
method that can compute nearest feasible (i.e. realistic with constraints)
counterfactual explanations. All of our results and our code can be found here

Abstract: Diffusion models have recently been extended to language generation through
Masked Diffusion Language Models (MDLMs), which achieve performance competitive
with strong autoregressive models. However, MDLMs tend to degrade in the
few-step regime and cannot directly adopt existing few-step distillation
methods designed for continuous diffusion models, as they lack the intrinsic
property of mapping from noise to data. Recent Uniform-state Diffusion Models
(USDMs), initialized from a uniform prior, alleviate some limitations but still
suffer from complex loss formulations that hinder scalability. In this work, we
propose a simplified denoising-based loss for USDMs that optimizes only
noise-replaced tokens, stabilizing training and matching ELBO-level
performance. Furthermore, by framing denoising as self-supervised learning, we
introduce a simple modification to our denoising loss with contrastive-inspired
negative gradients, which is practical and yield additional improvements in
generation quality.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 复杂高维数据（如无人机传感器读数）中的异常检测对操作安全至关重要，但现有方法在敏感性、可扩展性和捕获复杂依赖关系方面存在局限。

Method: DTD采用单步扩散过程预测噪声模式，结合图神经网络建模传感器关系为动态图，采用双分支架构（参数化神经网络能量评分和非参数统计方法）平衡计算效率与可解释性。

Result: 在无人机传感器数据、多元时间序列和图像上的广泛评估显示，DTD性能优于现有方法，在不同数据模态上具有通用性。

Conclusion: DTD的通用性和适应性使其成为安全关键应用（包括工业监控等）的变革性解决方案。

Abstract: Anomaly detection in complex, high-dimensional data, such as UAV sensor
readings, is essential for operational safety but challenging for existing
methods due to their limited sensitivity, scalability, and inability to capture
intricate dependencies. We propose the Diffuse to Detect (DTD) framework, a
novel approach that innovatively adapts diffusion models for anomaly detection,
diverging from their conventional use in generative tasks with high inference
time. By comparison, DTD employs a single-step diffusion process to predict
noise patterns, enabling rapid and precise identification of anomalies without
reconstruction errors. This approach is grounded in robust theoretical
foundations that link noise prediction to the data distribution's score
function, ensuring reliable deviation detection. By integrating Graph Neural
Networks to model sensor relationships as dynamic graphs, DTD effectively
captures spatial (inter-sensor) and temporal anomalies. Its two-branch
architecture, with parametric neural network-based energy scoring for
scalability and nonparametric statistical methods for interpretability,
provides flexible trade-offs between computational efficiency and transparency.
Extensive evaluations on UAV sensor data, multivariate time series, and images
demonstrate DTD's superior performance over existing methods, underscoring its
generality across diverse data modalities. This versatility, combined with its
adaptability, positions DTD as a transformative solution for safety-critical
applications, including industrial monitoring and beyond.

Conclusion: 提出的自适应拒绝和非交换性共形预测框架成功解决了持续领域预训练中LLMs的统计可靠性问题，为实际应用提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Continual Learning (CL) is essential for enabling self-evolving large
language models (LLMs) to adapt and remain effective amid rapid knowledge
growth. Yet, despite its importance, little attention has been given to
establishing statistical reliability guarantees for LLMs under CL, particularly
in the setting of continual domain pretraining (CDP). Conformal Prediction (CP)
has shown promise in offering correctness guarantees for LLMs, but it faces
major challenges in CDP: testing data often stems from unknown or shifting
domain distributions, under which CP may no longer provide valid guarantees.
Moreover, when high coverage is required, CP can yield excessively large
prediction sets for unanswerable queries, reducing informativeness. To address
these challenges, we introduce an adaptive rejection and non-exchangeable CP
framework. Our method first estimates the distribution of questions across
domains in the test set using transformer-based clustering, then reweights or
resamples the calibration data accordingly. Building on this, adaptive
rejection CP allows the LLM to selectively abstain from answering when its
confidence or competence shifts significantly. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our framework enhances both the effectiveness and reliability
of CP under CDP scenarios. Our code is available at:

Motivation: 辅助学习需要人工标注辅助任务，耗费人力且需要领域专业知识。现有元学习方法使用双级优化，计算成本高且代码复杂。

Method: 使用强化学习框架，RL代理为每个训练数据点选择辅助标签，当选择能提升主任务性能时获得奖励。同时实验学习每个数据点的辅助损失权重策略。

Result: 在20超类CIFAR100问题上，RL方法超越人工标注辅助任务(75.53%→80.9%)，与双级优化方法性能相当。权重学习方法显著优于所有基准。

Conclusion: RL是动态生成辅助任务的可行方法，同时学习每样本辅助任务权重可以取得优异结果。

Abstract: Auxiliary Learning (AL) is a special case of Multi-task Learning (MTL) in
which a network trains on auxiliary tasks to improve performance on its main
task. This technique is used to improve generalization and, ultimately,
performance on the network's main task. AL has been demonstrated to improve
performance across multiple domains, including navigation, image
classification, and natural language processing. One weakness of AL is the need
for labeled auxiliary tasks, which can require human effort and domain
expertise to generate. Meta Learning techniques have been used to solve this
issue by learning an additional auxiliary task generation network that can
create helpful tasks for the primary network. The most prominent techniques
rely on Bi-Level Optimization, which incurs computational cost and increased
code complexity. To avoid the need for Bi-Level Optimization, we present an
RL-based approach to dynamically create auxiliary tasks. In this framework, an
RL agent is tasked with selecting auxiliary labels for every data point in a
training set. The agent is rewarded when their selection improves the
performance on the primary task. We also experiment with learning optimal
strategies for weighing the auxiliary loss per data point. On the 20-Superclass
CIFAR100 problem, our RL approach outperforms human-labeled auxiliary tasks and
performs as well as a prominent Bi-Level Optimization technique. Our weight
learning approaches significantly outperform all of these benchmarks. For
example, a Weight-Aware RL-based approach helps the VGG16 architecture achieve
80.9% test accuracy while the human-labeled auxiliary task setup achieved
75.53%. The goal of this work is to (1) prove that RL is a viable approach to
dynamically generate auxiliary tasks and (2) demonstrate that per-sample
auxiliary task weights can be learned alongside the auxiliary task labels and
can achieve strong results.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 复合气候灾害(如野火引发的停电和城市热浪)挑战城市的稳定性和公平性，需要开发能够整合物理灾害建模与社会公平的决策支持系统。

Method: 结合物理信息神经网络建模、多模态数据融合(IoT、无人机、卫星数据)和公平感知风险分析，使用强化学习自适应调整数据源权重，并在合成城区进行模拟测试。

Result: 在部分传感器失效情况下，H-RDT能维持稳定的室内温度预测(约31-33°C)；前瞻性干预措施(如预防性冷却中心激活和微电网共享)使人口加权热风险降低11-13%，尾部风险降低7-17%，过热时间减少达9%。

Conclusion: H-RDT为城市数字韧性建立了可转移的基础框架，将物理灾害建模与社会公平和决策智能相结合，推动数字城市韧性向自适应、基于学习和以公平为中心的决策支持发展。

Abstract: Compounding climate hazards, such as wildfire-induced outages and urban
heatwaves, challenge the stability and equity of cities. We present a
Hazard-Responsive Digital Twin (H-RDT) that combines physics-informed neural
network modeling, multimodal data fusion, and equity-aware risk analytics for
urban-scale response. In a synthetic district with diverse building archetypes
and populations, a simulated wildfire-outage-heatwave cascade shows that H-RDT
maintains stable indoor temperature predictions (approximately 31 to 33 C)
under partial sensor loss, reproducing outage-driven surges and recovery. The
reinforcement learning based fusion module adaptively reweights IoT, UAV, and
satellite inputs to sustain spatiotemporal coverage, while the equity-adjusted
mapping isolates high-vulnerability clusters (schools, clinics, low-income
housing). Prospective interventions, such as preemptive cooling-center
activation and microgrid sharing, reduce population-weighted thermal risk by 11
to 13 percent, shrink the 95th-percentile (tail) risk by 7 to 17 percent, and
cut overheating hours by up to 9 percent. Beyond the synthetic demonstration,
the framework establishes a transferable foundation for real-city
implementation, linking physical hazard modeling with social equity and
decision intelligence. The H-RDT advances digital urban resilience toward
adaptive, learning-based, and equity-centered decision support for climate
adaptation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于状态空间模型的深度神经网络虽然擅长处理长序列任务，但训练后压缩困难。为了解决这个问题，需要开发有效的压缩方法。

Method: 通过正则化状态空间模型的汉克尔奇异值之和，促使奇异值快速衰减，从而实现模型压缩。开发了利用系统矩阵块对角结构的高效算法来计算汉克尔奇异值。

Result: 在Long Range Arena基准测试中，正则化的状态空间层比标准状态空间层压缩率高10倍，同时保持高精度。

Conclusion: 汉克尔奇异值正则化是一种有效的方法，可以显著提高状态空间模型的压缩性，同时保持模型性能。

Abstract: Deep neural networks using state space models as layers are well suited for
long-range sequence tasks but can be challenging to compress after training. We
use that regularizing the sum of Hankel singular values of state space models
leads to a fast decay of these singular values and thus to compressible models.
To make the proposed Hankel singular value regularization scalable, we develop
an algorithm to efficiently compute the Hankel singular values during training
iterations by exploiting the specific block-diagonal structure of the system
matrices that is we use in our state space model parametrization. Experiments
on Long Range Arena benchmarks demonstrate that the regularized state space
layers are up to 10$\times$ more compressible than standard state space layers
while maintaining high accuracy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的中心核对齐(CKA)方法不考虑底层流形结构，依赖大量启发式方法，在不同数据规模下表现不一致

Method: 提出MKA方法，将流形几何整合到核对齐任务中，并建立了理论框架

Result: 在合成数据集和真实世界示例上的实证评估表明，MKA比现有方法更稳健

Conclusion: 流形感知的核对齐为表示度量提供了更稳健的基础，在表示学习中有潜在应用价值

Abstract: Centered kernel alignment (CKA) is a popular metric for comparing
representations, determining equivalence of networks, and neuroscience
research. However, CKA does not account for the underlying manifold and relies
on numerous heuristics that cause it to behave differently at different scales
of data. In this work, we propose Manifold approximated Kernel Alignment (MKA),
which incorporates manifold geometry into the alignment task. We derive a
theoretical framework for MKA. We perform empirical evaluations on synthetic
datasets and real-world examples to characterize and compare MKA to its
contemporaries. Our findings suggest that manifold-aware kernel alignment
provides a more robust foundation for measuring representations, with potential
applications in representation learning.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SARNet是一个基于现代时序卷积网络的剩余使用寿命预测框架，通过尖峰感知检测提供物理可解释性，在故障发生时表现更稳健且误差更低。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RUL预测模型在故障开始时表现脆弱且缺乏可解释性：短时高能尖峰被平滑或误读，固定阈值降低灵敏度，缺乏基于物理解释的方法。

Method: 结合现代时序卷积网络预测退化敏感指标，采用自适应连续阈值验证真实尖峰并抑制噪声，对故障易发段进行针对性特征工程，最后使用堆叠RF-LGBM回归器输出最终RUL。

Result: 在基准数据集的事件触发协议下，SARNet相比近期基线方法持续降低误差（RMSE 0.0365，MAE 0.0204），同时保持轻量、稳健且易于部署。

Conclusion: SARNet通过尖峰感知检测和物理信息可解释性，在RUL预测中实现了更高的准确性和鲁棒性，为系统可靠性提升和维护风险降低提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Accurate prediction of remaining useful life (RUL) is essential to enhance
system reliability and reduce maintenance risk. Yet many strong contemporary
models are fragile around fault onset and opaque to engineers: short,
high-energy spikes are smoothed away or misread, fixed thresholds blunt
sensitivity, and physics-based explanations are scarce. To remedy this, we
introduce SARNet (Spike-Aware Consecutive Validation Framework), which builds
on a Modern Temporal Convolutional Network (ModernTCN) and adds spike-aware
detection to provide physics-informed interpretability. ModernTCN forecasts
degradation-sensitive indicators; an adaptive consecutive threshold validates
true spikes while suppressing noise. Failure-prone segments then receive
targeted feature engineering (spectral slopes, statistical derivatives, energy
ratios), and the final RUL is produced by a stacked RF--LGBM regressor. Across

*Chenlong Yin,Zeyang Sha,Shiwen Cui,Changhua Meng*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 研究发现增强大语言模型的推理能力会系统性增加工具幻觉，揭示推理增强与工具可靠性之间的根本权衡关系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究表明推理能力增强与幻觉增加存在关联，但缺乏系统性研究验证推理增强是否直接导致工具幻觉。

Method: 构建SimpleToolHalluBench诊断基准，通过控制实验研究推理增强对工具幻觉的影响，并评估缓解策略。

Result: 发现推理增强与工具幻觉存在因果关系，这种效应超越过拟合，且方法无关，缓解策略显示可靠性与能力之间存在权衡。

Conclusion: 当前推理增强方法固有地放大工具幻觉，需要开发同时优化能力和可靠性的新训练目标。

Abstract: Enhancing the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) is a key
strategy for building Agents that "think then act." However, recent
observations, like OpenAI's o3, suggest a paradox: stronger reasoning often
coincides with increased hallucination, yet no prior work has systematically
examined whether reasoning enhancement itself causes tool hallucination. To
address this gap, we pose the central question: Does strengthening reasoning
increase tool hallucination? To answer this, we introduce SimpleToolHalluBench,
a diagnostic benchmark measuring tool hallucination in two failure modes: (i)
no tool available, and (ii) only distractor tools available. Through controlled
experiments, we establish three key findings. First, we demonstrate a causal
relationship: progressively enhancing reasoning through RL increases tool
hallucination proportionally with task performance gains. Second, this effect
transcends overfitting - training on non-tool tasks (e.g., mathematics) still
amplifies subsequent tool hallucination. Third, the effect is method-agnostic,
appearing when reasoning is instilled via supervised fine-tuning and when it is
merely elicited at inference by switching from direct answers to step-by-step
thinking. We also evaluate mitigation strategies including Prompt Engineering
and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), revealing a fundamental
reliability-capability trade-off: reducing hallucination consistently degrades
utility. Mechanistically, Reasoning RL disproportionately collapses
tool-reliability-related representations, and hallucinations surface as
amplified divergences concentrated in late-layer residual streams. These
findings reveal that current reasoning enhancement methods inherently amplify
tool hallucination, highlighting the need for new training objectives that
jointly optimize for capability and reliability.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文研究了谱梯度下降(SpecGD)在数据不平衡情况下的泛化优势，发现相比传统梯度下降，SpecGD能够更均衡地学习数据的各个主成分，从而在训练早期获得更好的平衡准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着Muon和Shampoo等谱感知矩阵值优化器在深度学习中的广泛应用，需要系统研究它们的泛化特性，特别是在什么情况下能超越竞争算法。

Method: 使用数据不平衡作为测试平台，研究谱梯度下降(SpecGD)的规范形式，并在高斯混合数据模型和线性/双线性模型中量化分析SpecGD与普通梯度下降的性能差异。

Result: 研究发现SpecGD能够以相同速率学习数据的所有主成分，而传统梯度下降优先学习主导主成分。这导致SpecGD在训练早期获得更好的平衡准确率，且这种优势在深度线性模型中更加明显。

Conclusion: 谱优化器通过促进数据底层成分的更均衡学习，实现了优越的泛化性能，这一发现在各种不平衡数据集上得到了实证验证。

Abstract: The growing adoption of spectrum-aware matrix-valued optimizers such as Muon
and Shampoo in deep learning motivates a systematic study of their
generalization properties and, in particular, when they might outperform
competitive algorithms. We approach this question by introducing appropriate
simplifying abstractions as follows: First, we use imbalanced data as a
testbed. Second, we study the canonical form of such optimizers, which is
Spectral Gradient Descent (SpecGD) -- each update step is $UV^T$ where $U\Sigma
V^T$ is the truncated SVD of the gradient. Third, within this framework we
identify a canonical setting for which we precisely quantify when SpecGD
outperforms vanilla Euclidean GD. For a Gaussian mixture data model and both
linear and bilinear models, we show that unlike GD, which prioritizes learning
dominant principal components of the data first, SpecGD learns all principal
components of the data at equal rates. We demonstrate how this translates to a
growing gap in balanced accuracy favoring SpecGD early in training and further
show that the gap remains consistent even when the GD counterpart uses adaptive
step-sizes via normalization. By extending the analysis to deep linear models,
we show that depth amplifies these effects. We empirically verify our
theoretical findings on a variety of imbalanced datasets. Our experiments
compare practical variants of spectral methods, like Muon and Shampoo, against
their Euclidean counterparts and Adam. The results validate our findings that
these spectral optimizers achieve superior generalization by promoting a more
balanced learning of the data's underlying components.

TL;DR: 提出QoSMGAA架构，通过多阶注意力机制和对抗神经网络解决QoS预测中的数据稀疏和结构噪声问题，显著提升预测精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着网络服务数量的指数级增长，相似服务众多导致选择困难，现有QoS预测方法难以捕捉丰富上下文信息且在数据稀疏和结构噪声下性能较差。

Method: 集成多阶注意力机制聚合上下文数据，使用对抗神经网络进行自回归监督学习，采用Gumbel-Softmax离散采样技术生成负样本捕获高阶交互。

Result: 在大规模真实数据集上的实验验证表明，该模型显著优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: QoSMGAA在复杂噪声网络服务环境中具有强大潜力，适用于服务选择和推荐场景的实际部署。

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of internet technologies, network services have
become critical for delivering diverse and reliable applications to users.
However, the exponential growth in the number of available services has
resulted in many similar offerings, posing significant challenges in selecting
optimal services. Predicting Quality of Service (QoS) accurately thus becomes a
fundamental prerequisite for ensuring reliability and user satisfaction.
However, existing QoS prediction methods often fail to capture rich contextual
information and exhibit poor performance under extreme data sparsity and
structural noise. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel architecture, QoSMGAA,
specifically designed to enhance prediction accuracy in complex and noisy
network service environments. QoSMGAA integrates a multi-order attention
mechanism to aggregate extensive contextual data and predict missing QoS values
effectively. Additionally, our method incorporates adversarial neural networks
to perform autoregressive supervised learning based on transformed interaction
matrices. To capture complex, higher-order interactions among users and
services, we employ a discrete sampling technique leveraging the Gumbel-Softmax
method to generate informative negative samples. Comprehensive experimental
validation conducted on large-scale real-world datasets demonstrates that our
proposed model significantly outperforms existing baseline methods,
highlighting its strong potential for practical deployment in service selection
and recommendation scenarios.

Motivation: 现有等变模型大多局限于旋转等简单对称性，无法处理科学领域中常见的更广泛的一般线性变换GL(n)对称性。

Method: 引入了一种新的伴随不变双线性层，能够稳定地实现李代数特征和矩阵值输入的等变性，无需为每个子群重新设计。

Result: 在sl(3)和sp(4)对称性的代数基准测试中优于现有方法；在洛伦兹等变粒子物理任务中取得竞争性结果；在3D无人机状态估计中联合处理速度和协方差，显著提高了轨迹精度。

Conclusion: ReLNs为在李代数和矩阵值数据上学习广泛线性群对称性提供了一个实用且通用的框架。

Abstract: Encoding symmetries is a powerful inductive bias for improving the
generalization of deep neural networks. However, most existing equivariant
models are limited to simple symmetries like rotations, failing to address the
broader class of general linear transformations, GL(n), that appear in many
scientific domains. We introduce Reductive Lie Neurons (ReLNs), a novel neural
network architecture exactly equivariant to these general linear symmetries.
ReLNs are designed to operate directly on a wide range of structured inputs,
including general n-by-n matrices. ReLNs introduce a novel adjoint-invariant
bilinear layer to achieve stable equivariance for both Lie-algebraic features
and matrix-valued inputs, without requiring redesign for each subgroup. This
architecture overcomes the limitations of prior equivariant networks that only
apply to compact groups or simple vector data. We validate ReLNs' versatility
across a spectrum of tasks: they outperform existing methods on algebraic
benchmarks with sl(3) and sp(4) symmetries and achieve competitive results on a
Lorentz-equivariant particle physics task. In 3D drone state estimation with
geometric uncertainty, ReLNs jointly process velocities and covariances,
yielding significant improvements in trajectory accuracy. ReLNs provide a
practical and general framework for learning with broad linear group symmetries
on Lie algebras and matrix-valued data. Project page:

Abstract: Random Forests (RF) and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) are two of the
most widely used and highly performing classification and regression models.
They aggregate equally weighted CART trees, generated randomly in RF or
sequentially in XGBoost. In this paper, we propose Adaptive Forests (AF), a
novel approach that adaptively selects the weights of the underlying CART
models. AF combines (a) the Optimal Predictive-Policy Trees (OP2T) framework to
prescribe tailored, input-dependent unequal weights to trees and (b) Mixed
Integer Optimization (MIO) to refine weight candidates dynamically, enhancing
overall performance. We demonstrate that AF consistently outperforms RF,
XGBoost, and other weighted RF in binary and multi-class classification
problems over 20+ real-world datasets.

Motivation: 研究语言模型在上下文组合任务中的能力，探索如何将基本技能组合完成复合任务，这比标准设置更具挑战性。

Method: 对多个开源语言模型进行系统性实验，使用语言和逻辑任务来探测组合能力，并进行理论分析。

Result: 简单任务示例对性能有负面影响，模型难以正确识别和组合技能，即使使用思维链示例也是如此。

Conclusion: 示例与组合步骤的对齐至关重要，基于此洞察提出的方法在探测任务中表现改善，为研究提供了积极支持。

Abstract: Composing basic skills from simple tasks to accomplish composite tasks is
crucial for modern intelligent systems. We investigate the in-context
composition ability of language models to perform composite tasks that combine
basic skills demonstrated in in-context examples. This is more challenging than
the standard setting, where skills and their composition can be learned in
training. We conduct systematic experiments on various representative
open-source language models, utilizing linguistic and logical tasks designed to
probe composition abilities. The results reveal that simple task examples can
have a surprising negative impact on the performance, because the models
generally struggle to recognize and assemble the skills correctly, even with
Chain-of-Thought examples. Theoretical analysis further shows that it is
crucial to align examples with the corresponding steps in the composition. This
inspires a method for the probing tasks, whose improved performance provides
positive support for our insights.

TL;DR: 本文证明了softmax函数在所有ℓ_p范数(p≥1)下具有统一的Lipschitz常数1/2，而非传统认为的1，这显著改进了现有理论分析。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有机器学习模型和优化算法的鲁棒性保证及收敛性分析通常假设softmax算子的Lipschitz常数为1，但这一假设可能过于保守，限制了理论分析的紧致性。

Method: 通过数学分析证明softmax函数在所有ℓ_p范数下的Lipschitz常数统一为1/2，并验证了该常数在p=1和p=∞时的可达性。

Result: 证明了softmax的Lipschitz常数确实为1/2，这一更紧致的常数直接改进了现有关于鲁棒性和收敛性的理论结果，并在注意力架构和强化学习策略中得到了实证验证。

Conclusion: softmax函数具有统一的1/2 Lipschitz常数，这一发现为机器学习理论和应用提供了更精确的分析工具，显著提升了现有理论结果的紧致性。

Abstract: The softmax function is a basic operator in machine learning and
optimization, used in classification, attention mechanisms, reinforcement
learning, game theory, and problems involving log-sum-exp terms. Existing
robustness guarantees of learning models and convergence analysis of
optimization algorithms typically consider the softmax operator to have a
Lipschitz constant of $1$ with respect to the $\ell_2$ norm. In this work, we
prove that the softmax function is contractive with the Lipschitz constant
$1/2$, uniformly across all $\ell_p$ norms with $p \ge 1$. We also show that
the local Lipschitz constant of softmax attains $1/2$ for $p = 1$ and $p =
\infty$, and for $p \in (1,\infty)$, the constant remains strictly below $1/2$
and the supremum $1/2$ is achieved only in the limit. To our knowledge, this is
the first comprehensive norm-uniform analysis of softmax Lipschitz continuity.
We demonstrate how the sharper constant directly improves a range of existing
theoretical results on robustness and convergence. We further validate the
sharpness of the $1/2$ Lipschitz constant of the softmax operator through
empirical studies on attention-based architectures (ViT, GPT-2, Qwen3-8B) and
on stochastic policies in reinforcement learning.

TL;DR: MoEMeta是一个新颖的元学习框架，通过解耦全局共享知识和任务特定上下文来解决少样本知识图谱关系学习中的两个关键问题，显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的少样本知识图谱关系学习方法存在两个主要缺陷：一是孤立地学习关系元知识，未能捕捉跨任务共享的通用关系模式；二是难以有效整合对快速适应至关重要的局部任务特定上下文。

Method: 提出MoEMeta框架，包含两个关键创新：(1) 混合专家模型学习全局共享关系原型以增强泛化能力；(2) 任务定制适应机制捕捉局部上下文以实现快速任务特定适应。

Result: 在三个知识图谱基准测试上的广泛实验和分析表明，MoEMeta始终优于现有基线方法，达到了最先进的性能水平。

Conclusion: 通过平衡全局泛化与局部适应能力，MoEMeta显著推进了少样本关系学习的发展，为解决现有方法的局限性提供了有效方案。

Abstract: Few-shot knowledge graph relational learning seeks to perform reasoning over
relations given only a limited number of training examples. While existing
approaches largely adopt a meta-learning framework for enabling fast adaptation
to new relations, they suffer from two key pitfalls. First, they learn relation
meta-knowledge in isolation, failing to capture common relational patterns
shared across tasks. Second, they struggle to effectively incorporate local,
task-specific contexts crucial for rapid adaptation. To address these
limitations, we propose MoEMeta, a novel meta-learning framework that
disentangles globally shared knowledge from task-specific contexts to enable
both effective generalization and rapid adaptation. MoEMeta introduces two key
innovations: (i) a mixture-of-experts (MoE) model that learns globally shared
relational prototypes to enhance generalization, and (ii) a task-tailored
adaptation mechanism that captures local contexts for fast task-specific
adaptation. By balancing global generalization with local adaptability, MoEMeta
significantly advances few-shot relational learning. Extensive experiments and
analyses on three KG benchmarks demonstrate that MoEMeta consistently
outperforms existing baselines, achieving state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: Recent advances in reinforcement learning (RL) have substantially improved
the training of large-scale language models, leading to significant gains in
generation quality and reasoning ability. However, most existing research
focuses on dense models, while RL training for Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)
architectures remains underexplored. To address the instability commonly
observed in MoE training, we propose a novel router-aware approach to optimize
importance sampling (IS) weights in off-policy RL. Specifically, we design a
rescaling strategy guided by router logits, which effectively reduces gradient
variance and mitigates training divergence. Experimental results demonstrate
that our method significantly improves both the convergence stability and the
final performance of MoE models, highlighting the potential of RL algorithmic
innovations tailored to MoE architectures and providing a promising direction
for efficient training of large-scale expert models.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了用于动态数据流的近似最近邻搜索和近似核密度估计的亚线性空间草图算法，在流式模型和滑动窗口模型中实现了亚线性内存和查询时间保证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在大规模和动态数据流中，设计能够保持数据结构特性同时支持高效查询的紧凑草图是一个核心挑战。现有工作主要关注精确最近邻搜索，而近似最近邻搜索和近似核密度估计在动态流中的亚线性草图设计仍缺乏理论保证。

Method: 对于流式模型中的ANN，设计了基于LSH的亚线性草图，仅存储总输入数据的亚线性部分；对于滑动窗口模型中的A-KDE，提出了基于LSH范围的草图结构。两种方法都支持亚线性查询时间和批量查询。

Result: ANN草图仅需O(n^(1+ρ-η))内存，存储n^(-η)比例的数据；A-KDE草图大小为O(RW/(√(1+ε)-1)·log²N)。实验验证了草图在真实数据集上的轻量级和低误差特性。

Conclusion: 这是首个在动态流中为ANN和A-KDE提供理论亚线性草图保证的工作，实现了内存大小和近似误差之间的近乎最优权衡，特别是在滑动窗口模型中的A-KDE是首次的理论结果。

Abstract: Approximate Nearest Neighbor (ANN) search and Approximate Kernel Density
Estimation (A-KDE) are fundamental problems at the core of modern machine
learning, with broad applications in data analysis, information systems, and
large-scale decision making. In massive and dynamic data streams, a central
challenge is to design compact sketches that preserve essential structural
properties of the data while enabling efficient queries.
  In this work, we develop new sketching algorithms that achieve sublinear
space and query time guarantees for both ANN and A-KDE for a dynamic stream of
data. For ANN in the streaming model, under natural assumptions, we design a
sublinear sketch that requires only $\mathcal{O}(n^{1+\rho-\eta})$ memory by
storing only a sublinear ($n^{-\eta}$) fraction of the total inputs, where
$\rho$ is a parameter of the LSH family, and $0<\eta<1$. Our method supports
sublinear query time, batch queries, and extends to the more general Turnstile
model. While earlier works have focused on Exact NN, this is the first result
on ANN that achieves near-optimal trade-offs between memory size and
approximation error.
  Next, for A-KDE in the Sliding-Window model, we propose a sketch of size
$\mathcal{O}\left(RW \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{1+\epsilon} - 1} \log^2 N\right)$,
where $R$ is the number of sketch rows, $W$ is the LSH range, $N$ is the window
size, and $\epsilon$ is the approximation error. This, to the best of our
knowledge, is the first theoretical sublinear sketch guarantee for A-KDE in the
Sliding-Window model.
  We complement our theoretical results with experiments on various real-world
datasets, which show that the proposed sketches are lightweight and achieve
consistently low error in practice.

Conclusion: CrysLLMGen成功整合了LLM和扩散模型的互补优势，为晶体材料生成提供了有效的混合框架，能够满足用户定义的约束条件。

Abstract: Recent advances in generative modeling have shown significant promise in
designing novel periodic crystal structures. Existing approaches typically rely
on either large language models (LLMs) or equivariant denoising models, each
with complementary strengths: LLMs excel at handling discrete atomic types but
often struggle with continuous features such as atomic positions and lattice
parameters, while denoising models are effective at modeling continuous
variables but encounter difficulties in generating accurate atomic
compositions. To bridge this gap, we propose CrysLLMGen, a hybrid framework
that integrates an LLM with a diffusion model to leverage their complementary
strengths for crystal material generation. During sampling, CrysLLMGen first
employs a fine-tuned LLM to produce an intermediate representation of atom
types, atomic coordinates, and lattice structure. While retaining the predicted
atom types, it passes the atomic coordinates and lattice structure to a
pre-trained equivariant diffusion model for refinement. Our framework
outperforms state-of-the-art generative models across several benchmark tasks
and datasets. Specifically, CrysLLMGen not only achieves a balanced performance
in terms of structural and compositional validity but also generates more
stable and novel materials compared to LLM-based and denoisingbased models
Furthermore, CrysLLMGen exhibits strong conditional generation capabilities,
effectively producing materials that satisfy user-defined constraints. Code is

Abstract: This note reconciles two seemingly distinct approaches to policy gradient
optimization for the Pass@K objective in reinforcement learning with verifiable
rewards: (1) direct REINFORCE-style methods, and (2) advantage-shaping
techniques that directly modify GRPO. We show that these are two sides of the
same coin. By reverse-engineering existing advantage-shaping algorithms, we
reveal that they implicitly optimize surrogate rewards. We specifically
interpret practical ``hard-example up-weighting'' modifications to GRPO as
reward-level regularization. Conversely, starting from surrogate reward
objectives, we provide a simple recipe for deriving both existing and new
advantage-shaping methods. This perspective provides a lens for RLVR policy
gradient optimization beyond our original motivation of Pass@K.

Abstract: Pre-trained models exhibit strong generalization to various downstream tasks.
However, given the numerous models available in the model hub, identifying the
most suitable one by individually fine-tuning is time-consuming. In this paper,
we propose \textbf{SwiftTS}, a swift selection framework for time series
pre-trained models. To avoid expensive forward propagation through all
candidates, SwiftTS adopts a learning-guided approach that leverages historical
dataset-model performance pairs across diverse horizons to predict model
performance on unseen datasets. It employs a lightweight dual-encoder
architecture that embeds time series and candidate models with rich
characteristics, computing patchwise compatibility scores between data and
model embeddings for efficient selection. To further enhance the generalization
across datasets and horizons, we introduce a horizon-adaptive expert
composition module that dynamically adjusts expert weights, and the
transferable cross-task learning with cross-dataset and cross-horizon task
sampling to enhance out-of-distribution (OOD) robustness. Extensive experiments
on 14 downstream datasets and 8 pre-trained models demonstrate that SwiftTS
achieves state-of-the-art performance in time series pre-trained model
selection.

Conclusion: TCSIS提供了一种有效的离散状态空间采样方法，无需目标分布样本或配分函数计算。

Abstract: We introduce the Target Concrete Score Identity Sampler (TCSIS), a method for
sampling from unnormalized densities on discrete state spaces by learning the
reverse dynamics of a Continuous-Time Markov Chain (CTMC). Our approach builds
on a forward in time CTMC with a uniform noising kernel and relies on the
proposed Target Concrete Score Identity, which relates the concrete score, the
ratio of marginal probabilities of two states, to a ratio of expectations of
Boltzmann factors under the forward uniform diffusion kernel. This formulation
enables Monte Carlo estimation of the concrete score without requiring samples
from the target distribution or computation of the partition function. We
approximate the concrete score with a neural network and propose two
algorithms: Self-Normalized TCSIS and Unbiased TCSIS. Finally, we demonstrate
the effectiveness of TCSIS on problems from statistical physics.

Result: 发现神经网络模拟器能够隐式学习比训练数据更正则化的动力学，具有更有利的误差累积特性，从而在某些操作机制下可能超越训练数据源达到更高的物理保真度

Conclusion: 需要重新评估模拟器基准测试，神经网络模拟器在特定操作机制下可能达到比其训练数据源更高的物理保真度

Abstract: Neural operators or emulators for PDEs trained on data from numerical solvers
are conventionally assumed to be limited by their training data's fidelity. We
challenge this assumption by identifying "emulator superiority," where neural
networks trained purely on low-fidelity solver data can achieve higher accuracy
than those solvers when evaluated against a higher-fidelity reference. Our
theoretical analysis reveals how the interplay between emulator inductive
biases, training objectives, and numerical error characteristics enables
superior performance during multi-step rollouts. We empirically validate this
finding across different PDEs using standard neural architectures,
demonstrating that emulators can implicitly learn dynamics that are more
regularized or exhibit more favorable error accumulation properties than their
training data, potentially surpassing training data limitations and mitigating
numerical artifacts. This work prompts a re-evaluation of emulator
benchmarking, suggesting neural emulators might achieve greater physical
fidelity than their training source within specific operational regimes.

Abstract: Physics Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) are gaining attention for their
ability to embed physical laws into deep learning models, which is particularly
useful in structural engineering tasks with limited data. This paper aims to
explore the use of PINNs to predict the weight of small scale spaghetti
bridges, a task relevant to understanding load limits and potential failure
modes in simplified structural models. Our proposed framework incorporates
physics-based constraints to the prediction model for improved performance. In
addition to standard PINNs, we introduce a novel architecture named Physics
Informed Kolmogorov Arnold Network (PIKAN), which blends universal function
approximation theory with physical insights. The structural parameters provided
as input to the model are collected either manually or through computer vision
methods. Our dataset includes 15 real bridges, augmented to 100 samples, and
our best model achieves an $R^2$ score of 0.9603 and a mean absolute error
(MAE) of 10.50 units. From applied perspective, we also provide a web based
interface for parameter entry and prediction. These results show that PINNs can
offer reliable estimates of structural weight, even with limited data, and may
help inform early stage failure analysis in lightweight bridge designs.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于聚类过程的异常值检测方法，通过四个标准模拟人类专家视觉识别异常值的方式，克服了现有技术忽略领域对象固有分散性的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有异常值检测技术往往忽略领域对象的固有分散性，且大多基于纯数值分析而非人类专家的视觉识别方式。

Method: 基于聚类过程，设计四个标准来模拟人类专家在分析聚类后视觉识别异常值的方式。

Result: 在两个不同领域（稳定测量学和脑电图）的数据上评估，假阳性率低于2%，可靠性大于99%。

Conclusion: 该方法在不同领域中有效检测异常数据，具有低假阳性率和高可靠性。

Abstract: Outlier detection is an important problem occurring in a wide range of areas.
Outliers are the outcome of fraudulent behaviour, mechanical faults, human
error, or simply natural deviations. Many data mining applications perform
outlier detection, often as a preliminary step in order to filter out outliers
and build more representative models. In this paper, we propose an outlier
detection method based on a clustering process. The aim behind the proposal
outlined in this paper is to overcome the specificity of many existing outlier
detection techniques that fail to take into account the inherent dispersion of
domain objects. The outlier detection method is based on four criteria designed
to represent how human beings (experts in each domain) visually identify
outliers within a set of objects after analysing the clusters. This has an
advantage over other clustering-based outlier detection techniques that are
founded on a purely numerical analysis of clusters. Our proposal has been
evaluated, with satisfactory results, on data (particularly time series) from
two different domains: stabilometry, a branch of medicine studying
balance-related functions in human beings and electroencephalography (EEG), a
neurological exploration used to diagnose nervous system disorders. To validate
the proposed method, we studied method outlier detection and efficiency in
terms of runtime. The results of regression analyses confirm that our proposal
is useful for detecting outlier data in different domains, with a false
positive rate of less than 2% and a reliability greater than 99%.

*Chi Liu*

TL;DR: 该论文从信息论角度重新解读GSPO算法中的长度归一化重要性比率，揭示了其与困惑度比率和交叉熵变化之间的数学等价关系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为理解GSPO算法中序列级权重$s(\theta) = (\pi_\theta/\pi_{\theta_{\text{old}}})^{1/|y|}$的本质，探索其与信息论量之间的联系，从而更好地解释算法的经验特性。

Method: 通过数学推导建立GSPO序列级权重与困惑度比率$\text{PPL}_{\theta_{\text{old}}}/\text{PPL}_\theta$以及指数交叉熵变化$\exp(\Delta H)$的等价关系，并在数学推理任务上进行受控实验验证。

Result: 成功证明了GSPO的序列级权重可以等价表示为困惑度比率和指数交叉熵变化，这一信息论视角有助于解释GSPO的经验特性，包括通过几何平均实现的log域方差减少和在专家混合模型训练中的稳定性。

Conclusion: 为GSPO算法提供了信息论解释框架，表明该算法通过困惑度比率来加权策略梯度更新，这一视角有助于理解和改进基于策略梯度的序列生成方法。

Abstract: We provide a new perspective on GSPO's length-normalized importance ratios by
establishing their connection to information-theoretic quantities. We show that
GSPO's sequence-level weight $s(\theta) =
(\pi_\theta/\pi_{\theta_{\text{old}}})^{1/|y|}$ can be equivalently expressed
as the inverse perplexity ratio
$\text{PPL}_{\theta_{\text{old}}}/\text{PPL}_\theta$ and as the exponential
cross-entropy change $\exp(\Delta H)$. While the perplexity-entropy
relationship follows from standard definitions, this observation provides a
useful lens for understanding GSPO: the algorithm weights policy gradient
updates by perplexity ratios, offering an information-theoretic interpretation
of the importance weights. This perspective helps explain GSPO's empirical
properties, including log-domain variance reduction through geometric averaging
and stability in training mixture-of-experts models. We validate the
mathematical equivalences and variance predictions through controlled
experiments on mathematical reasoning tasks.

TL;DR: 提出PDiT架构，在单一Transformer中交替感知和决策层，通过对比损失对齐文本任务嵌入和视觉特征，在BabyAI环境中表现优于标准PPO基线


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统架构将感知（视觉编码器）与决策（策略网络）分离，导致策略失败无法直接帮助感知模块学习重要信息，效率低下

Method: 实现PDiT架构，在Transformer中交替感知和决策层，集成CLIP启发的对比损失来对齐文本任务嵌入和视觉场景特征

Result: 在BabyAI GoToLocal环境中，PDiT编码器获得更稳定的奖励和更强的对齐效果，优于标准PPO基线

Conclusion: 交错Transformer编码器是开发更集成自主代理的有前景方向

Abstract: Deep reinforcement learning agents often struggle when tasks require
understanding both vision and language. Conventional architectures typically
isolate perception (for example, CNN-based visual encoders) from
decision-making (policy networks). This separation can be inefficient, since
the policy's failures do not directly help the perception module learn what is
important. To address this, we implement the Perception-Decision Interleaving
Transformer (PDiT) architecture introduced by Mao et al. (2023), a model that
alternates between perception and decision layers within a single transformer.
This interleaving allows feedback from decision-making to refine perceptual
features dynamically. In addition, we integrate a contrastive loss inspired by
CLIP to align textual mission embeddings with visual scene features. We
evaluate the PDiT encoders on the BabyAI GoToLocal environment and find that
the approach achieves more stable rewards and stronger alignment compared to a
standard PPO baseline. The results suggest that interleaved transformer
encoders are a promising direction for developing more integrated autonomous
agents.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于FPGA的节能手势识别方案，使用轻量级神经网络和原始波形输入，在保持高精度的同时大幅降低能耗和延迟。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有振动手势识别方法依赖复杂预处理和大规模神经网络，需要高性能硬件，导致高能耗且难以实际部署。需要开发能在低功耗设备上实时运行的节能解决方案。

Method: 采用原始波形输入替代复杂频谱预处理；设计两种轻量级架构（1D-CNN和1D-SepCNN）；使用整数量化和自动RTL生成；扩展硬件感知搜索框架进行模型配置选择。

Result: 在AMD Spartan-7 FPGA上，6位1D-CNN达到0.970平均精度，延迟9.22ms；8位1D-SepCNN延迟降至6.83ms（比CPU快53倍），精度0.949。每次推理能耗低于1.2mJ。

Conclusion: 该方法实现了低延迟、高能效的手势识别，适合长期边缘计算部署，为智能家居接口提供了实用的非侵入式传感解决方案。

Abstract: The growing demand for smart home interfaces has increased interest in
non-intrusive sensing methods like vibration-based gesture recognition. While
prior studies demonstrated feasibility, they often rely on complex
preprocessing and large Neural Networks (NNs) requiring costly high-performance
hardware, resulting in high energy usage and limited real-world deployability.
This study proposes an energy-efficient solution deploying compact NNs on
low-power Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) to enable real-time gesture
recognition with competitive accuracy. We adopt a series of optimizations: (1)
We replace complex spectral preprocessing with raw waveform input, eliminating
complex on-board preprocessing while reducing input size by 21x without
sacrificing accuracy. (2) We design two lightweight architectures (1D-CNN and
1D-SepCNN) tailored for embedded FPGAs, reducing parameters from 369 million to
as few as 216 while maintaining comparable accuracy. (3) With integer-only
quantization and automated RTL generation, we achieve seamless FPGA deployment.
A ping-pong buffering mechanism in 1D-SepCNN further improves deployability
under tight memory constraints. (4) We extend a hardware-aware search framework
to support constraint-driven model configuration selection, considering
accuracy, deployability, latency, and energy consumption. Evaluated on two
swipe-direction datasets with multiple users and ordinary tables, our approach
achieves low-latency, energy-efficient inference on the AMD Spartan-7 XC7S25
FPGA. Under the PS data splitting setting, the selected 6-bit 1D-CNN reaches
0.970 average accuracy across users with 9.22 ms latency. The chosen 8-bit
1D-SepCNN further reduces latency to 6.83 ms (over 53x CPU speedup) with
slightly lower accuracy (0.949). Both consume under 1.2 mJ per inference,
demonstrating suitability for long-term edge operation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预测性基准测试在机器学习研究中被广泛使用，但仅凭基准分数无法直接支持科学推断，需要明确相关的理论假设。

Method: 借鉴心理学测量理论，开发了构建效度条件，并通过ImageNet、WeatherBench和Fragile Families Challenge三个案例研究来检验这些假设。

Result: 明确了基准分数支持科学主张所需的条件，揭示了预测性基准测试作为认识论实践的重要性。

Conclusion: 预测性基准测试需要明确的理论假设才能有效支持科学推断，该框架为机器学习中的概念和理论推理提供了重要视角。

Abstract: Predictive benchmarking, the evaluation of machine learning models based on
predictive performance and competitive ranking, is a central epistemic practice
in machine learning research and an increasingly prominent method for
scientific inquiry. Yet, benchmark scores alone provide at best measurements of
model performance relative to an evaluation dataset and a concrete learning
problem. Drawing substantial scientific inferences from the results, say about
theoretical tasks like image classification, requires additional assumptions
about the theoretical structure of the learning problems, evaluation functions,
and data distributions. We make these assumptions explicit by developing
conditions of construct validity inspired by psychological measurement theory.
We examine these assumptions in practice through three case studies, each
exemplifying a typical intended inference: measuring engineering progress in
computer vision with ImageNet; evaluating policy-relevant weather predictions
with WeatherBench; and examining limitations of the predictability of life
events with the Fragile Families Challenge. Our framework clarifies the
conditions under which benchmark scores can support diverse scientific claims,
bringing predictive benchmarking into perspective as an epistemological
practice and a key site of conceptual and theoretical reasoning in machine
learning.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了PTPP感知的适应缩放定律，将预训练预算作为显式变量，能够准确预测未见PTPP值的适应损失，并在多语言设置中验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的持续预训练缩放定律通常假设固定的预训练预算，这限制了它们预测在不同tokens-per-parameter(PTPP)下训练的模型适应结果的能力。

Method: 开发PTPP感知的适应缩放定律，使预训练预算成为显式变量，并在多语言设置（英语/阿拉伯语→法语）上进行验证。

Result: 在PTPP={15,31}的早期阶段训练的PTPP感知公式能够准确预测PTPP=279时的目标损失，并在多个指标上优于PTPP不可知的基线方法。

Conclusion: PTPP感知缩放定律不仅能准确预测适应损失，还能在实际应用中规划重放比率和适应token预算，在计算限制下满足目标和遗忘约束。

Abstract: Continual pre-training (CPT) for domain adaptation must balance target-domain
gains with stability on the base domain. Existing CPT scaling laws typically
assume a fixed pre-training budget, which limits their ability to forecast
adaptation outcomes for models trained at different tokens-per-parameter
(PTPP). We present \emph{PTPP-aware} adaptation scaling laws that make the
pre-training budget an explicit variable, enabling accurate \emph{prediction}
of adaptation loss at unseen \ptpp. On a multilingual setup (English/Arabic
$\rightarrow$ French), PTPP-aware formulations trained on early stages
(\ptpp{}=\{15,31\}) predict target loss at \ptpp{}=279 and outperform a
PTPP-agnostic \dcpt{} transfer baseline on metrics (Huber-on-log,
MAE$_\mathrm{rel}$, calibration slope); full diagnostics (RMSE, MAPE) are in
the appendix. Beyond forecasting, we show a practical use case: planning replay
ratios and adaptation token budgets that satisfy target and forgetting
constraints under compute limits.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有代码生成数据集大多只包含问题和解决方案，缺乏指导编码过程的中间推理步骤，限制了LLMs在代码生成方面的进展。

Method: 结合四个关键组件：精选竞赛问题、网络挖掘内容、基于推理模式的数据扩展、多阶段执行验证，并使用遗传变异算法增加任务多样性。

Result: 在该数据集上微调的LLMs在编码基准测试中表现一致提升，推理感知数据可以替代模型缩放，在不同架构间泛化良好，在相同样本预算下优于领先的开源替代方案。

Conclusion: 以推理为中心的合成数据生成是提升LLMs编码能力的高效方法，发布了数据集和生成管道以促进进一步研究。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive promise in code
generation, yet their progress remains limited by the shortage of large-scale
datasets that are both diverse and well-aligned with human reasoning. Most
existing resources pair problems with solutions, but omit the intermediate
thought process that guides coding. To close this gap, we present a scalable
synthetic data generation pipeline that produces nearly 800k
instruction-reasoning-code-test quadruplets. Each sample combines a task, a
step-by-step reasoning trace, a working solution, and executable tests,
enabling models to learn not just the what but also the how of problem solving.
Our pipeline combines four key components: curated contest problems, web-mined
content filtered by relevance classifiers, data expansion guided by reasoning
patterns, and multi-stage execution-based validation. A genetic mutation
algorithm further increases task diversity while maintaining consistency
between reasoning traces and code implementations. Our key finding is that
fine-tuning LLMs on this dataset yields consistent improvements on coding
benchmarks. Beyond raw accuracy, reasoning-aware data can substitute for model
scaling, generalize across architectures, and outperform leading open-source
alternatives under identical sample budgets. Our work establishes
reasoning-centered synthetic data generation as an efficient approach for
advancing coding capabilities in LLMs. We publish our dataset and generation
pipeline to facilitate further research.

Result: 实验结果显示SCSF相比各种数值求解器实现了最高3.5倍的加速

Conclusion: SCSF是首个加速特征值数据生成的方法，通过利用算子间相似性显著提高了数据生成效率

Abstract: Eigenvalue problems are among the most important topics in many scientific
disciplines. With the recent surge and development of machine learning, neural
eigenvalue methods have attracted significant attention as a forward pass of
inference requires only a tiny fraction of the computation time compared to
traditional solvers. However, a key limitation is the requirement for large
amounts of labeled data in training, including operators and their eigenvalues.
To tackle this limitation, we propose a novel method, named Sorting Chebyshev
Subspace Filter (SCSF), which significantly accelerates eigenvalue data
generation by leveraging similarities between operators -- a factor overlooked
by existing methods. Specifically, SCSF employs truncated fast Fourier
transform sorting to group operators with similar eigenvalue distributions and
constructs a Chebyshev subspace filter that leverages eigenpairs from
previously solved problems to assist in solving subsequent ones, reducing
redundant computations. To the best of our knowledge, SCSF is the first method
to accelerate eigenvalue data generation. Experimental results show that SCSF
achieves up to a $3.5\times$ speedup compared to various numerical solvers.

Motivation: 图和其他非欧几里得域上的低通图滤波器计算成本高昂，因为需要重复求解特征值问题来计算对应的低频子空间。

Method: 基于Grassmann流形上法坐标的黎曼插值算法，推导了子空间插值的误差界限估计。

Result: 提出了两种应用：通过相似性校正调整网络同质性程度将节点特征的时间演化转换为图拓扑演化；基于给定静态图诱导的点积图族，通过滤波器插值改进节点分类的消息传递方案。

Conclusion: 该算法为参数化图族的低通滤波器计算提供了高效解决方案，并展示了在动态图拓扑和节点分类任务中的实际应用价值。

Abstract: Low-pass graph filters are fundamental for signal processing on graphs and
other non-Euclidean domains. However, the computation of such filters for
parametric graph families can be prohibitively expensive as computation of the
corresponding low-frequency subspaces, requires the repeated solution of an
eigenvalue problem. We suggest a novel algorithm of low-pass graph filter
interpolation based on Riemannian interpolation in normal coordinates on the
Grassmann manifold. We derive an error bound estimate for the subspace
interpolation and suggest two possible applications for induced parametric
graph families. First, we argue that the temporal evolution of the node
features may be translated to the evolving graph topology via a similarity
correction to adjust the homophily degree of the network. Second, we suggest a
dot product graph family induced by a given static graph which allows to infer
improved message passing scheme for node classification facilitated by the
filter interpolation.

Motivation: 现有的隐量子马尔可夫模型学习算法对数据损坏高度敏感，缺乏在对抗性扰动下确保鲁棒性的机制

Method: 提出AC-HQMM框架，允许部分观测序列被对抗性损坏；开发RILA算法，结合熵过滤去除损坏行模块和迭代随机重采样过程，使用L1惩罚似然目标增强稳定性

Result: 在多个HQMM和HMM基准测试中，RILA展现出优越的收敛稳定性、损坏恢复能力和物理有效性保持能力

Conclusion: RILA为稳健的量子序列学习建立了原则性和高效的方法

Abstract: Hidden Quantum Markov Models (HQMMs) extend classical Hidden Markov Models to
the quantum domain, offering a powerful probabilistic framework for modeling
sequential data with quantum coherence. However, existing HQMM learning
algorithms are highly sensitive to data corruption and lack mechanisms to
ensure robustness under adversarial perturbations. In this work, we introduce
the Adversarially Corrupted HQMM (AC-HQMM), which formalizes robustness
analysis by allowing a controlled fraction of observation sequences to be
adversarially corrupted. To learn AC-HQMMs, we propose the Robust Iterative
Learning Algorithm (RILA), a derivative-free method that integrates a Remove
Corrupted Rows by Entropy Filtering (RCR-EF) module with an iterative
stochastic resampling procedure for physically valid Kraus operator updates.
RILA incorporates L1-penalized likelihood objectives to enhance stability,
resist overfitting, and remain effective under non-differentiable conditions.
Across multiple HQMM and HMM benchmarks, RILA demonstrates superior convergence
stability, corruption resilience, and preservation of physical validity
compared to existing algorithms, establishing a principled and efficient
approach for robust quantum sequential learning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统聚类算法在处理高维和非均匀分布数据时，低密度边界样本容易受到邻近簇干扰，导致聚类结果不稳定和扭曲。

Method: 引入群体级优化机制，将低密度边界点聚合成协作移动的群体；结合局部密度估计和邻域拓扑，构建群体与周围环境的有效引力相互作用；使用群体作为基本运动单元，通过引力收缩策略确保全局稳定和方向一致的收敛。

Result: 在多个高维数据集上的实验表明，GCAO优于11种代表性聚类方法，在NMI、ARI、Homogeneity和ACC指标上分别平均提升37.13%、52.08%、44.98%和38.81%，同时保持竞争性的效率和可扩展性。

Conclusion: GCAO在保持簇完整性、增强边界可分性和确保复杂数据分布上的鲁棒性能方面具有显著优势。

Abstract: Traditional clustering algorithms often struggle with high-dimensional and
non-uniformly distributed data, where low-density boundary samples are easily
disturbed by neighboring clusters, leading to unstable and distorted clustering
results. To address this issue, we propose a Group-driven Clustering via
Gravitational Attraction and Optimization (GCAO) algorithm. GCAO introduces a
group-level optimization mechanism that aggregates low-density boundary points
into collaboratively moving groups, replacing the traditional point-based
contraction process. By combining local density estimation with neighborhood
topology, GCAO constructs effective gravitational interactions between groups
and their surroundings, enhancing boundary clarity and structural consistency.
Using groups as basic motion units, a gravitational contraction strategy
ensures globally stable and directionally consistent convergence. Experiments
on multiple high-dimensional datasets demonstrate that GCAO outperforms 11
representative clustering methods, achieving average improvements of 37.13%,
52.08%, 44.98%, and 38.81% in NMI, ARI, Homogeneity, and ACC, respectively,
while maintaining competitive efficiency and scalability. These results
highlight GCAO's superiority in preserving cluster integrity, enhancing
boundary separability, and ensuring robust performance on complex data
distributions.

TL;DR: 本文提出了两种新的时间序列分割评估指标WARI和SMS，解决了现有评估方法在捕捉分割质量、错误类型和可解释性方面的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有时间序列分割评估方法主要关注变化点准确性或使用基于点的度量（如ARI），无法充分评估分割段的质量、忽略错误性质且可解释性有限。

Method: 提出了WARI（加权调整兰德指数）考虑分割错误的位置，以及SMS（状态匹配分数）这种细粒度度量，能够识别和评分四种基本分割错误类型并支持错误特定加权。

Result: 在合成和真实世界基准测试上的实证验证表明，WARI和SMS不仅提供了更准确的分割质量评估，还能揭示传统度量无法获取的错误来源和类型等洞察。

Conclusion: WARI和SMS是改进时间序列分割评估的有效新指标，能够提供更全面、可解释的性能分析。

Abstract: Time series segmentation is a fundamental task in analyzing temporal data
across various domains, from human activity recognition to energy monitoring.
While numerous state-of-the-art methods have been developed to tackle this
problem, the evaluation of their performance remains critically limited.
Existing measures predominantly focus on change point accuracy or rely on
point-based measures such as Adjusted Rand Index (ARI), which fail to capture
the quality of the detected segments, ignore the nature of errors, and offer
limited interpretability. In this paper, we address these shortcomings by
introducing two novel evaluation measures: WARI (Weighted Adjusted Rand Index),
that accounts for the position of segmentation errors, and SMS (State Matching
Score), a fine-grained measure that identifies and scores four fundamental
types of segmentation errors while allowing error-specific weighting. We
empirically validate WARI and SMS on synthetic and real-world benchmarks,
showing that they not only provide a more accurate assessment of segmentation
quality but also uncover insights, such as error provenance and type, that are
inaccessible with traditional measures.

Abstract: Circuit discovery, which involves identifying sparse and task-relevant
subnetworks in pre-trained language models, is a cornerstone of mechanistic
interpretability. Automated Circuit Discovery (ACDC) has emerged as a pivotal
methodology in circuit discovery, but its application to large language models
is severely limited by computational inefficiency and prohibitively high memory
requirements. Although several accelerated approaches have been proposed, they
primarily rely on linear approximations to ACDC, which significantly
compromises analytical faithfulness. Our proposed method for accelerating
automated circuit discovery, Per Attention Head Quantization (PAHQ), takes a
fundamentally different approach by optimizing the efficiency of each
individual patching operation. PAHQ leverages a fundamental alignment between
activation patching and mixed-precision quantization (MPQ): interpretability
analysis through patching essentially performs targeted ablation studies.
Therefore, we can maintain high precision exclusively for investigated
components while safely reducing precision elsewhere in the network.
PAHQ-accelerated ACDC reduces runtime by up to 80\% and memory consumption by
up to 30\% compared to unaccelerated ACDC while maintaining faithfulness.
Importantly, our method readily integrates with existing edge-based circuit
discovery techniques by modifying the attention computation mechanism. This
training-free approach provides a practical and novel pathway for accelerating
mechanistic interpretability methods. Our code is available at

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DAMPE是一个统一的多模态蛋白质嵌入框架，通过最优传输表示对齐和条件图生成融合方法，解决蛋白质功能预测中的跨模态分布不匹配和噪声关系图问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 蛋白质功能预测需要整合异构的内在信号（序列、结构）和噪声外在上下文（蛋白质相互作用、GO注释），但存在跨模态嵌入分布不匹配和噪声图数据影响GNN聚合两个关键挑战。

Method: 1. 基于最优传输的表示对齐：建立不同模态内在嵌入空间的对应关系；2. 基于条件图生成的信息融合：条件编码器融合对齐的内在嵌入为图重构提供信息线索。

Result: 在标准GO基准测试中，DAMPE优于或匹配DPFunc等最先进方法，AUPR提升0.002-0.013pp，Fmax提升0.004-0.007pp。消融研究显示OT对齐贡献0.043-0.064pp AUPR，CGG融合贡献0.005-0.111pp Fmax。

Conclusion: DAMPE提供了一个可扩展且理论基础的鲁棒多模态蛋白质表示学习方法，显著增强了蛋白质功能预测能力。

Abstract: Accurate protein function prediction requires integrating heterogeneous
intrinsic signals (e.g., sequence and structure) with noisy extrinsic contexts
(e.g., protein-protein interactions and GO term annotations). However, two key
challenges hinder effective fusion: (i) cross-modal distributional mismatch
among embeddings produced by pre-trained intrinsic encoders, and (ii) noisy
relational graphs of extrinsic data that degrade GNN-based information
aggregation. We propose Diffused and Aligned Multi-modal Protein Embedding
(DAMPE), a unified framework that addresses these through two core mechanisms.
First, we propose Optimal Transport (OT)-based representation alignment that
establishes correspondence between intrinsic embedding spaces of different
modalities, effectively mitigating cross-modal heterogeneity. Second, we
develop a Conditional Graph Generation (CGG)-based information fusion method,
where a condition encoder fuses the aligned intrinsic embeddings to provide
informative cues for graph reconstruction. Meanwhile, our theoretical analysis
implies that the CGG objective drives this condition encoder to absorb
graph-aware knowledge into its produced protein representations. Empirically,
DAMPE outperforms or matches state-of-the-art methods such as DPFunc on
standard GO benchmarks, achieving AUPR gains of 0.002-0.013 pp and Fmax gains
0.004-0.007 pp. Ablation studies further show that OT-based alignment
contributes 0.043-0.064 pp AUPR, while CGG-based fusion adds 0.005-0.111 pp
Fmax. Overall, DAMPE offers a scalable and theoretically grounded approach for
robust multi-modal protein representation learning, substantially enhancing
protein function prediction.

### [194] [Learning from Frustration: Torsor CNNs on Graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23288)
*Daiyuan Li,Shreya Arya,Robert Ghrist*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了Torsor CNNs框架，用于在具有局部对称性的图上进行学习，通过边势能编码相邻坐标系之间的群值变换，解决了传统等变神经网络依赖全局对称性的限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大多数等变神经网络依赖于单个全局对称性，这限制了它们在对称性是局部而非全局的领域中的应用。需要一种能够处理局部对称性的框架。

Method: 引入Torsor CNNs框架，使用边势能（群值变换）编码局部对称性，建立与群同步问题的等价关系，提出Torsor卷积层和挫折损失作为几何正则化器。

Result: 该框架统一并推广了包括经典CNN和流形上的Gauge CNN在内的多种架构，可在任意图上操作，无需全局坐标系或光滑流形结构。

Conclusion: Torsor CNNs为处理局部对称性提供了数学基础，并在多视角3D识别等应用中展示了实用性，其中相对相机姿态自然定义了所需的边势能。

Abstract: Most equivariant neural networks rely on a single global symmetry, limiting
their use in domains where symmetries are instead local. We introduce Torsor
CNNs, a framework for learning on graphs with local symmetries encoded as edge
potentials -- group-valued transformations between neighboring coordinate
frames. We establish that this geometric construction is fundamentally
equivalent to the classical group synchronization problem, yielding: (1) a
Torsor Convolutional Layer that is provably equivariant to local changes in
coordinate frames, and (2) the frustration loss -- a standalone geometric
regularizer that encourages locally equivariant representations when added to
any NN's training objective. The Torsor CNN framework unifies and generalizes
several architectures -- including classical CNNs and Gauge CNNs on manifolds
-- by operating on arbitrary graphs without requiring a global coordinate
system or smooth manifold structure. We establish the mathematical foundations
of this framework and demonstrate its applicability to multi-view 3D
recognition, where relative camera poses naturally define the required edge
potentials.

Motivation: 通过结合多实例学习和基于Transformer的符号回归，利用同一系统的重复观测来学习更通用的动态表示。

Result: 在1到4维系统和不同噪声水平下进行评估，始终优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: 简单均值聚合能显著提升性能，MIO在推断符号ODE方面表现出色。

Abstract: We introduce MIO, a transformer-based model for inferring symbolic ordinary
differential equations (ODEs) from multiple observed trajectories of a
dynamical system. By combining multiple instance learning with
transformer-based symbolic regression, the model effectively leverages repeated
observations of the same system to learn more generalizable representations of
the underlying dynamics. We investigate different instance aggregation
strategies and show that even simple mean aggregation can substantially boost
performance. MIO is evaluated on systems ranging from one to four dimensions
and under varying noise levels, consistently outperforming existing baselines.

TL;DR: 本文研究了预测编码(PC)作为反向传播(BP)的替代算法，通过优化理论分析PC的学习动态，提出新的μPC参数化方法，首次实现了100+层网络的稳定训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 反向传播算法能耗高且不太可能在大脑中实现，预测编码作为大脑启发的替代算法具有潜在效率优势，但深层PC网络难以训练且其动态机制理解不足。

Method: 采用优化理论方法分析PC学习动态，将其理解为近似信任域方法；研究PC利用高阶信息的能力；基于推理动态研究提出μPC新参数化方法。

Result: 证明PC学习动态可近似为使用二阶信息的信任域方法；发现PC可利用任意高阶信息，有效学习景观比损失景观更良性；μPC首次实现100+层网络稳定训练并在简单任务中表现竞争性。

Conclusion: 该论文显著推进了对PC网络推理和学习动态的基本理解，但未来研究需要关注硬件协同设计，以便PC能在规模上与BP竞争。

Abstract: Backpropagation (BP) is the standard algorithm for training the deep neural
networks that power modern artificial intelligence including large language
models. However, BP is energy inefficient and unlikely to be implemented by the
brain. This thesis studies an alternative, potentially more efficient
brain-inspired algorithm called predictive coding (PC). Unlike BP, PC networks
(PCNs) perform inference by iterative equilibration of neuron activities before
learning or weight updates. Recent work has suggested that this iterative
inference procedure provides a range of benefits over BP, such as faster
training. However, these advantages have not been consistently observed, the
inference and learning dynamics of PCNs are still poorly understood, and deep
PCNs remain practically untrainable. Here, we make significant progress towards
scaling PCNs by taking a theoretical approach grounded in optimisation theory.
First, we show that the learning dynamics of PC can be understood as an
approximate trust-region method using second-order information, despite
explicitly using only first-order local updates. Second, going beyond this
approximation, we show that PC can in principle make use of arbitrarily
higher-order information, such that for feedforward networks the effective
landscape on which PC learns is far more benign and robust to vanishing
gradients than the (mean squared error) loss landscape. Third, motivated by a
study of the inference dynamics of PCNs, we propose a new parameterisation
called ``$\mu$PC'', which for the first time allows stable training of 100+
layer networks with little tuning and competitive performance on simple tasks.
Overall, this thesis significantly advances our fundamental understanding of
the inference and learning dynamics of PCNs, while highlighting the need for
future research to focus on hardware co-design if PC is to compete with BP at
scale.

Motivation: 确保自动驾驶车辆传感器数据的可靠性，在实时应用中平衡检测精度和计算成本，保证车辆安全运行。

Method: 结合REMA（自适应平滑因子和阈值异常检测）、MS-SW（多级滑动窗口捕获短期和长期模式）、轻量级GRU模型（异常检测分类）和恢复模块（修复受损数据）。

Result: 异常数据F1-score 97.6%，正常数据F1-score 99.4%，能高精度分类不同类型异常，恢复模块准确修复受损数据，在检测精度和计算成本间取得良好平衡。

Conclusion: GRAD是自动驾驶系统中可靠高效的实时异常检测解决方案，保证车辆安全运行且计算开销最小。

Abstract: This paper introduces GRAD, a real-time anomaly detection method for
autonomous vehicle sensors that integrates statistical analysis and deep
learning to ensure the reliability of sensor data. The proposed approach
combines the Reinforced Exponential Moving Average (REMA), which adapts
smoothing factors and thresholding for outlier detection, with the Multi-Stage
Sliding Window (MS-SW) technique for capturing both short- and long-term
patterns. These features are processed using a lightweight Gated Recurrent Unit
(GRU) model, which detects and classifies anomalies based on bias types, while
a recovery module restores damaged sensor data to ensure continuous system
operation. GRAD has a lightweight architecture consisting of two layers of GRU
with a limited number of neurons that make it appropriate for real-time
applications while maintaining high detection accuracy. The GRAD framework
achieved remarkable performance in anomaly detection and classification. The
model demonstrated an overall F1-score of 97.6% for abnormal data and 99.4% for
normal data, signifying its high accuracy in distinguishing between normal and
anomalous sensor data. Regarding the anomaly classification, GRAD successfully
categorized different anomaly types with high precision, enabling the recovery
module to accurately restore damaged sensor data. Relative to analogous
studies, GRAD surpasses current models by attaining a balance between elevated
detection accuracy and diminished computational expense. These results
demonstrate GRAD's potential as a reliable and efficient solution for real-time
anomaly detection in autonomous vehicle systems, guaranteeing safe vehicle
operation with minimal computational overhead.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决S-LoRA在多设备部署中存在的通信开销问题，特别是在实际应用中可能较大的通信延迟。

Method: 约束LoRA因子为块对角结构，设计了一种无需额外通信的LoRA适配器分片策略，与基础模型的张量并行执行良好对齐。

Result: 在8个A100 GPU上，Llama-3.1-70B获得最高1.79倍端到端加速，参数效率与标准LoRA相当；Llama-3.1-8B获得最高1.63倍加速。

Conclusion: 块对角LoRA方法在保持参数效率的同时，显著减少了通信开销，为多GPU环境下的LoRA适配器部署提供了高效的解决方案。

Abstract: When serving a single base LLM with several different LoRA adapters
simultaneously, the adapters cannot simply be merged with the base model's
weights as the adapter swapping would create overhead and requests using
different adapters could not be batched. Rather, the LoRA computations have to
be separated from the base LLM computations, and in a multi-device setup the
LoRA adapters can be sharded in a way that is well aligned with the base
model's tensor parallel execution, as proposed in S-LoRA. However, the S-LoRA
sharding strategy encounters some communication overhead, which may be small in
theory, but can be large in practice. In this paper, we propose to constrain
certain LoRA factors to be block-diagonal, which allows for an alternative way
of sharding LoRA adapters that does not require any additional communication
for the LoRA computations. We demonstrate in extensive experiments that our
block-diagonal LoRA approach is similarly parameter efficient as standard LoRA
(i.e., for a similar number of parameters it achieves similar downstream
performance) and that it leads to significant end-to-end speed-up over S-LoRA.
For example, when serving on eight A100 GPUs, we observe up to 1.79x (1.23x)
end-to-end speed-up with 0.87x (1.74x) the number of adapter parameters for
Llama-3.1-70B, and up to 1.63x (1.3x) end-to-end speed-up with 0.86x (1.73x)
the number of adapter parameters for Llama-3.1-8B.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于可学习Sigmoid算子的乘法更新近端梯度算法(SSO-PGA)，用于解决非负逆问题中传统PGA的稳定性差和违反非负约束的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统近端梯度算法(PGA)在图像重建等逆问题中经常产生不稳定收敛和次优解，主要原因是梯度下降步骤会引入负值并导致对超参数的高度敏感性。

Method: 用可学习的Sigmoid算子替代传统的梯度下降步骤，将减法更新转换为乘法更新，强制实施非负性和有界性；通过滑动参数增强稳定性和收敛性；将算法展开为深度网络。

Result: 在数值和真实世界实验中，该方法显著优于传统PGA和其他最先进算法，确保了优越的性能和稳定性。

Conclusion: SSO-PGA通过创新的乘法更新机制有效解决了传统PGA在非负逆问题中的局限性，结合了优化的可解释性和深度学习的强大能力。

Abstract: Proximal gradient algorithms (PGA), while foundational for inverse problems
like image reconstruction, often yield unstable convergence and suboptimal
solutions by violating the critical non-negativity constraint. We identify the
gradient descent step as the root cause of this issue, which introduces
negative values and induces high sensitivity to hyperparameters. To overcome
these limitations, we propose a novel multiplicative update proximal gradient
algorithm (SSO-PGA) with convergence guarantees, which is designed for
robustness in non-negative inverse problems. Our key innovation lies in
superseding the gradient descent step with a learnable sigmoid-based operator,
which inherently enforces non-negativity and boundedness by transforming
traditional subtractive updates into multiplicative ones. This design,
augmented by a sliding parameter for enhanced stability and convergence, not
only improves robustness but also boosts expressive capacity and noise
immunity. We further formulate a degradation model for multi-modal restoration
and derive its SSO-PGA-based optimization algorithm, which is then unfolded
into a deep network to marry the interpretability of optimization with the
power of deep learning. Extensive numerical and real-world experiments
demonstrate that our method significantly surpasses traditional PGA and other
state-of-the-art algorithms, ensuring superior performance and stability.

Abstract: Flood susceptibility mapping (FSM) is vital for disaster prevention but
remains challenging in data-scarce regions where hydrodynamic models require
dense geophysical inputs. This work introduces ZeroFlood, a geospatial
foundation model framework for data-efficient FSM. The approach fine-tunes
Geospatial Foundation Models (GFMs) with Thinking-in-Modality (TiM) reasoning,
enabling flood prediction from basic Earth observation data such as Sentinel-1

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged as a powerful accelerator of
materials discovery, yet most existing models remain problem-specific,
requiring additional data collection and retraining for each new property. Here
we introduce and validate GATE (Geometrically Aligned Transfer Encoder) -- a
generalizable AI framework that jointly learns 34 physicochemical properties
spanning thermal, electrical, mechanical, and optical domains. By aligning
these properties within a shared geometric space, GATE captures cross-property
correlations that reduce disjoint-property bias -- a key factor causing false
negatives in multi-criteria screening. To demonstrate its generalizability,
GATE -- without any problem-specific reconfiguration -- was directly applied to
the discovery of immersion cooling fluids for data centers, a stringent
real-world challenge defined by the Open Compute Project (OCP). Screening
billions of candidates, GATE identified 92,861 molecules as promising for
practical deployment. Four were experimentally or literarily validated, showing
strong agreement with wet-lab measurements and performance comparable to or

Abstract: We investigate a relatively underexplored class of hybrid neurosymbolic
models integrating symbolic learning with neural reasoning to construct data
generators meeting formal correctness criteria. In \textit{Symbolic Neural
Generators} (SNGs), symbolic learners examine logical specifications of
feasible data from a small set of instances -- sometimes just one. Each
specification in turn constrains the conditional information supplied to a
neural-based generator, which rejects any instance violating the symbolic
specification. Like other neurosymbolic approaches, SNG exploits the
complementary strengths of symbolic and neural methods. The outcome of an SNG
is a triple $(H, X, W)$, where $H$ is a symbolic description of feasible
instances constructed from data, $X$ a set of generated new instances that
satisfy the description, and $W$ an associated weight. We introduce a semantics
for such systems, based on the construction of appropriate \textit{base} and
\textit{fibre} partially-ordered sets combined into an overall partial order,
and outline a probabilistic extension relevant to practical applications. In
this extension, SNGs result from searching over a weighted partial ordering. We
implement an SNG combining a restricted form of Inductive Logic Programming
(ILP) with a large language model (LLM) and evaluate it on early-stage drug
design. Our main interest is the description and the set of potential inhibitor
molecules generated by the SNG. On benchmark problems -- where drug targets are
well understood -- SNG performance is statistically comparable to
state-of-the-art methods. On exploratory problems with poorly understood
targets, generated molecules exhibit binding affinities on par with leading
clinical candidates. Experts further find the symbolic specifications useful as
preliminary filters, with several generated molecules identified as viable for
synthesis and wet-lab testing.

Abstract: The application of Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) to
mathematical and coding domains has demonstrated significant improvements in
the reasoning and problem-solving abilities of Large Language Models. Despite
its success in single generation problem solving, the reinforcement learning
fine-tuning process may harm the model's exploration ability, as reflected in
decreased diversity of generations and a resulting degradation of performance
during Best-of-N sampling for large N values. In this work, we focus on
optimizing the max@k metric, a continuous generalization of pass@k. We derive
an unbiased on-policy gradient estimate for direct optimization of this metric.
Furthermore, we extend our derivations to the off-policy updates, a common
element in modern RLVR algorithms, that allows better sample efficiency.
Empirically, we show that our objective effectively optimizes max@k metric in
off-policy scenarios, aligning the model with the Best-of-N inference strategy.

Result: EV在真实数据集上实现了改进的分布外鲁棒性和稳定的价值排序，同时保持计算轻量级。

Conclusion: EV为存在领域偏移的大规模场景提供了高效的分布外鲁棒数据估值解决方案。

Abstract: Data valuation has become central in the era of data-centric AI. It drives
efficient training pipelines and enables objective pricing in data markets by
assigning a numeric value to each data point. Most existing data valuation
methods estimate the effect of removing individual data points by evaluating
changes in model validation performance under in-distribution (ID) settings, as
opposed to out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios where data follow different
patterns. Since ID and OOD data behave differently, data valuation methods
based on ID loss often fail to generalize to OOD settings, particularly when
the validation set contains no OOD data. Furthermore, although OOD-aware
methods exist, they involve heavy computational costs, which hinder practical
deployment. To address these challenges, we introduce \emph{Eigen-Value} (EV),
a plug-and-play data valuation framework for OOD robustness that uses only an
ID data subset, including during validation. EV provides a new spectral
approximation of domain discrepancy, which is the gap of loss between ID and
OOD using ratios of eigenvalues of ID data's covariance matrix. EV then
estimates the marginal contribution of each data point to this discrepancy via
perturbation theory, alleviating the computational burden. Subsequently, EV
plugs into ID loss-based methods by adding an EV term without any additional
training loop. We demonstrate that EV achieves improved OOD robustness and
stable value rankings across real-world datasets, while remaining
computationally lightweight. These results indicate that EV is practical for
large-scale settings with domain shift, offering an efficient path to
OOD-robust data valuation.

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合图神经网络学习特征与通用分子描述符的混合建模方法，通过MetaModel框架集成多种机器学习模型，在分子性质预测任务中优于现有最佳模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了在分子性质预测中获得最佳性能，需要结合通用描述符和任务特定的学习特征，并使用多样化的机器学习模型进行预测。

Method: 开发了MetaModel框架，将图神经网络(GNN)学习到的分子描述符与通用描述符结合，并集成多种领先的机器学习模型进行预测。

Result: 在所有测试的回归数据集和6/9的分类数据集上超越了当前最先进的ChemProp模型，且GNN特征的加入提升了集成模型在原本表现不佳的数据集上的性能。

Conclusion: 要在广泛的问题上实现最优性能，必须将通用描述符与任务特定的学习特征相结合，并使用多样化的机器学习模型进行预测。

Abstract: We explore a "best-of-both" approach to modelling molecular properties by
combining learned molecular descriptors from a graph neural network (GNN) with
general-purpose descriptors and a mixed ensemble of machine learning (ML)
models. We introduce a MetaModel framework to aggregate predictions from a
diverse set of leading ML models. We present a featurisation scheme for
combining task-specific GNN-derived features with conventional molecular
descriptors.
  We demonstrate that our framework outperforms the cutting-edge ChemProp model
on all regression datasets tested and 6 of 9 classification datasets. We
further show that including the GNN features derived from ChemProp boosts the
ensemble model's performance on several datasets where it otherwise would have
underperformed. We conclude that to achieve optimal performance across a wide
set of problems, it is vital to combine general-purpose descriptors with
task-specific learned features and use a diverse set of ML models to make the
predictions.

*Lingxiao Huang,Zhize Li,Nisheeth K. Vishnoi,Runkai Yang,Haoyu Zhao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文研究了在数据集被已知分布的随机噪声污染时构建(k,z)-聚类核心集的问题，提出了一种新的代理误差度量方法，能够在噪声环境下获得更小的核心集和更紧的近似保证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统核心集构建方法在数据集被噪声污染时面临挑战，因为真实底层数据集不可观测，难以评估核心集质量。需要开发能够在噪声环境下有效工作的核心集构造方法。

Method: 提出了一种新的代理误差度量方法，该方法独立于噪声分布定义，但能够提供与真实聚类成本相关的近似保证。基于此度量设计了核心集构造算法，在数据和噪声的温和假设下工作。

Result: 理论证明新方法获得的核心集大小可比传统方法减少poly(k)倍，其中n是数据集大小。在真实数据集上的实验验证了理论发现，展示了方法的实际优势。

Conclusion: 新提出的代理误差度量方法在噪声环境下能够产生更小的核心集并提供更紧的聚类成本保证，相比传统方法具有显著改进。

Abstract: We study the problem of constructing coresets for $(k, z)$-clustering when
the input dataset is corrupted by stochastic noise drawn from a known
distribution. In this setting, evaluating the quality of a coreset is
inherently challenging, as the true underlying dataset is unobserved. To
address this, we investigate coreset construction using surrogate error metrics
that are tractable and provably related to the true clustering cost. We analyze
a traditional metric from prior work and introduce a new error metric that more
closely aligns with the true cost. Although our metric is defined independently
of the noise distribution, it enables approximation guarantees that scale with
the noise level. We design a coreset construction algorithm based on this
metric and show that, under mild assumptions on the data and noise, enforcing
an $\varepsilon$-bound under our metric yields smaller coresets and tighter
guarantees on the true clustering cost than those obtained via classical
metrics. In particular, we prove that the coreset size can improve by a factor
of up to $\mathrm{poly}(k)$, where $n$ is the dataset size. Experiments on
real-world datasets support our theoretical findings and demonstrate the
practical advantages of our approach.

Abstract: In this work, we study out-of-distribution generalization in meta-learning
from an information-theoretic perspective. We focus on two scenarios: (i) when
the testing environment mismatches the training environment, and (ii) when the
training environment is broader than the testing environment. The first
corresponds to the standard distribution mismatch setting, while the second
reflects a broad-to-narrow training scenario. We further formalize the
generalization problem in meta-reinforcement learning and establish
corresponding generalization bounds. Finally, we analyze the generalization
performance of a gradient-based meta-reinforcement learning algorithm.

TL;DR: 提出薛定谔神经网络(SNN)，一种基于量子力学原理的条件密度估计和不确定性量化架构，通过波函数表示概率密度，具有正定性、精确归一化和多模态建模等优势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统参数化似然头在概率建模中存在局限性，需要一种能够自然处理多模态分布、保证正定性和归一化、并能高效计算各种函数量的概率表示方法。

Method: 将输入映射到输出域上的归一化波函数，通过谱展开（如切比雪夫多项式）学习复数系数，利用玻恩规则计算预测概率，并引入物理启发的正则化项。

Conclusion: SNN为概率预测提供了一个连贯、可处理的框架，将点估计提升到基于物理启发的振幅分布，在不确定性量化方面具有重要价值。

Abstract: We introduce the Schrodinger Neural Network (SNN), a principled architecture
for conditional density estimation and uncertainty quantification inspired by
quantum mechanics. The SNN maps each input to a normalized wave function on the
output domain and computes predictive probabilities via the Born rule. The SNN
departs from standard parametric likelihood heads by learning complex
coefficients of a spectral expansion (e . g ., Chebyshev polynomials) whose
squared modulus yields the conditional density $p(y|x)=\left| \psi _x(y)\right|
{}^2$ with analytic normalization. This representation confers three practical
advantages: positivity and exact normalization by construction, native
multimodality through interference among basis modes without explicit mixture
bookkeeping, and yields closed-form (or efficiently computable)
functionals$-$such as moments and several calibration diagnostics$-$as
quadratic forms in coefficient space. We develop the statistical and
computational foundations of the SNN, including (i) training by exact
maximum-likelihood with unit-sphere coefficient parameterization, (ii)
physics-inspired quadratic regularizers (kinetic and potential energies)
motivated by uncertainty relations between localization and spectral
complexity, (iii) scalable low-rank and separable extensions for multivariate
outputs, (iv) operator-based extensions that represent observables,
constraints, and weak labels as self-adjoint matrices acting on the amplitude
space, and (v) a comprehensive framework for evaluating multimodal predictions.
The SNN provides a coherent, tractable framework to elevate probabilistic
prediction from point estimates to physically inspired amplitude-based
distributions.

TL;DR: SGFusion是一种利用移动用户地理信息的联邦学习训练算法，通过将数据映射到地理区域并为每个区域训练一个FL模型，使用分层随机图建模区域间相关性，通过MCMC采样实现概率性梯度融合。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 利用移动用户的地理信息来改进联邦学习，使模型能更好地适应不同地理区域用户的数据和行为特征。

Method: 将移动设备数据映射到地理区域，为每个区域训练FL模型；使用分层随机图建模区域间相关性；通过MCMC采样选择区域进行梯度融合；采用自注意力权重实现概率性梯度共享。

Result: 在6个国家的心率预测数据集上，SGFusion显著提高了模型效用，收敛时有上界期望误差，相比现有方法在所有国家都表现更好，且不影响系统可扩展性。

Conclusion: SGFusion通过地理梯度融合显著提升了联邦学习模型的性能，实现了地理区域间的知识共享，且计算成本可控。

Abstract: This paper proposes Stochastic Geographic Gradient Fusion (SGFusion), a novel
training algorithm to leverage the geographic information of mobile users in
Federated Learning (FL). SGFusion maps the data collected by mobile devices
onto geographical zones and trains one FL model per zone, which adapts well to
the data and behaviors of users in that zone. SGFusion models the local
data-based correlation among geographical zones as a hierarchical random graph
(HRG) optimized by Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling. At each training step,
every zone fuses its local gradient with gradients derived from a small set of
other zones sampled from the HRG. This approach enables knowledge fusion and
sharing among geographical zones in a probabilistic and stochastic gradient
fusion process with self-attention weights, such that "more similar" zones have
"higher probabilities" of sharing gradients with "larger attention weights."
SGFusion remarkably improves model utility without introducing undue
computational cost. Extensive theoretical and empirical results using a
heart-rate prediction dataset collected across 6 countries show that models
trained with SGFusion converge with upper-bounded expected errors and
significantly improve utility in all countries compared to existing approaches
without notable cost in system scalability.

Conclusion: 信道噪声可作为隐私保护的天然资源，在无线联邦学习中实现差分隐私而无需牺牲训练性能，为实际部署提供了更高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is a distributed learning paradigm that preserves
privacy by eliminating the need to exchange raw data during training. In its
prototypical edge instantiation with underlying wireless transmissions enabled
by analog over-the-air computing (AirComp), referred to as \emph{over-the-air
FL (AirFL)}, the inherent channel noise plays a unique role of \emph{frenemy}
in the sense that it degrades training due to noisy global aggregation while
providing a natural source of randomness for privacy-preserving mechanisms,
formally quantified by \emph{differential privacy (DP)}. It remains,
nevertheless, challenging to effectively harness such channel impairments, as
prior arts, under assumptions of either simple channel models or restricted
types of loss functions, mostly considering (local) DP enhancement with a
single-round or non-convergent bound on privacy loss. In this paper, we study
AirFL over multiple-access fading channels with a multi-antenna base station
(BS) subject to user-level DP requirements. Despite a recent study, which
claimed in similar settings that artificial noise (AN) must be injected to
ensure DP in general, we demonstrate, on the contrary, that DP can be gained as
a \emph{perk} even \emph{without} employing any AN. Specifically, we derive a
novel bound on DP that converges under general bounded-domain assumptions on
model parameters, along with a convergence bound with general smooth and
non-convex loss functions. Next, we optimize over receive beamforming and power
allocations to characterize the optimal convergence-privacy trade-offs, which
also reveal explicit conditions in which DP is achievable without compromising
training. Finally, our theoretical findings are validated by extensive
numerical results.

*Yuhan Yang,Xingbo Fu,Jundong Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出ADPrompt框架，通过自适应双提示机制在适应预训练图神经网络到下游任务时增强公平性，解决预训练模型在敏感属性上的歧视问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的图提示方法主要关注下游任务的模型效用，但忽视了公平性问题。预训练的GNN模型会在人口统计子组间产生歧视性节点表示，因为下游图数据在节点属性和图结构中都存在偏见。

Method: 提出自适应双提示框架：1) 自适应特征校正模块学习定制化属性提示来抑制输入层的敏感信息；2) 自适应消息校准模块在每层生成结构提示，调整邻居节点的消息以实现信息流的动态软校准；3) 联合优化两个提示模块。

Result: 在四个数据集和四种预训练策略上的实验表明，ADPrompt在节点分类任务上优于七个基线方法。

Conclusion: ADPrompt框架能有效增强预训练GNN模型在下游任务适应过程中的公平性，同时保持良好的模型性能。

Abstract: In recent years, pre-training Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) through
self-supervised learning on unlabeled graph data has emerged as a widely
adopted paradigm in graph learning. Although the paradigm is effective for
pre-training powerful GNN models, the objective gap often exists between
pre-training and downstream tasks. To bridge this gap, graph prompting adapts
pre-trained GNN models to specific downstream tasks with extra learnable
prompts while keeping the pre-trained GNN models frozen. As recent graph
prompting methods largely focus on enhancing model utility on downstream tasks,
they often overlook fairness concerns when designing prompts for adaptation. In
fact, pre-trained GNN models will produce discriminative node representations
across demographic subgroups, as downstream graph data inherently contains
biases in both node attributes and graph structures. To address this issue, we
propose an Adaptive Dual Prompting (ADPrompt) framework that enhances fairness
for adapting pre-trained GNN models to downstream tasks. To mitigate attribute
bias, we design an Adaptive Feature Rectification module that learns customized
attribute prompts to suppress sensitive information at the input layer,
reducing bias at the source. Afterward, we propose an Adaptive Message
Calibration module that generates structure prompts at each layer, which adjust
the message from neighboring nodes to enable dynamic and soft calibration of
the information flow. Finally, ADPrompt jointly optimizes the two prompting
modules to adapt the pre-trained GNN while enhancing fairness. We conduct
extensive experiments on four datasets with four pre-training strategies to
evaluate the performance of ADPrompt. The results demonstrate that our proposed
ADPrompt outperforms seven baseline methods on node classification tasks.

TL;DR: T-REGS是一个基于最小生成树长度的自监督学习正则化框架，可同时缓解维度坍缩并促进表示分布的均匀性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自监督学习需要避免维度坍缩（特征仅占据低维子空间）并增强表示分布的均匀性，现有方法难以同时解决这两个问题。

Method: 提出T-REGS框架，利用学习表示上最小生成树的长度作为正则化项，在任意紧致黎曼流形上同时缓解维度坍缩和促进分布均匀性。

Result: 在合成数据和经典自监督学习基准测试上的实验验证了该方法在提升表示质量方面的有效性。

Conclusion: T-REGS是一个简单有效的正则化框架，能够同时解决自监督学习中的维度坍缩和分布不均匀问题。

Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for
learning representations without labeled data, often by enforcing invariance to
input transformations such as rotations or blurring. Recent studies have
highlighted two pivotal properties for effective representations: (i) avoiding
dimensional collapse-where the learned features occupy only a low-dimensional
subspace, and (ii) enhancing uniformity of the induced distribution. In this
work, we introduce T-REGS, a simple regularization framework for SSL based on
the length of the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) over the learned representation.
We provide theoretical analysis demonstrating that T-REGS simultaneously
mitigates dimensional collapse and promotes distribution uniformity on
arbitrary compact Riemannian manifolds. Several experiments on synthetic data
and on classical SSL benchmarks validate the effectiveness of our approach at
enhancing representation quality.

Result: 实验证实该方法能在保持准确性的同时缩短思维链

Conclusion: 通过惩罚推理token可以鼓励简洁而准确的推理，在保持性能的同时减少计算开销

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) often consume excessive tokens, inflating
computational cost and latency. We challenge the assumption that longer
responses improve accuracy. By penalizing reasoning tokens using a discounted
reinforcement learning setup (interpretable as a small token cost) and
analyzing Blackwell optimality in restricted policy classes, we encourage
concise yet accurate reasoning. Experiments confirm our theoretical results
that this approach shortens chains of thought while preserving accuracy.

Conclusion: 该混合精度训练框架为神经ODE提供了可靠且高效的训练方案，解决了计算成本和内存需求的关键挑战。

Abstract: Exploiting low-precision computations has become a standard strategy in deep
learning to address the growing computational costs imposed by ever larger
models and datasets. However, naively performing all computations in low
precision can lead to roundoff errors and instabilities. Therefore, mixed
precision training schemes usually store the weights in high precision and use
low-precision computations only for whitelisted operations. Despite their
success, these principles are currently not reliable for training
continuous-time architectures such as neural ordinary differential equations
(Neural ODEs). This paper presents a mixed precision training framework for
neural ODEs, combining explicit ODE solvers with a custom backpropagation
scheme, and demonstrates its effectiveness across a range of learning tasks.
Our scheme uses low-precision computations for evaluating the velocity,
parameterized by the neural network, and for storing intermediate states, while
stability is provided by a custom dynamic adjoint scaling and by accumulating
the solution and gradients in higher precision. These contributions address two
key challenges in training neural ODE: the computational cost of repeated
network evaluations and the growth of memory requirements with the number of
time steps or layers. Along with the paper, we publish our extendable,
open-source PyTorch package rampde, whose syntax resembles that of leading
packages to provide a drop-in replacement in existing codes. We demonstrate the
reliability and effectiveness of our scheme using challenging test cases and on
neural ODE applications in image classification and generative models,
achieving approximately 50% memory reduction and up to 2x speedup while
maintaining accuracy comparable to single-precision training.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度Chebyshev物理信息KANs（cPIKANs）存在训练不稳定问题，限制了其在多个PDE问题中的应用。

Method: 提出了基础无关的Glorot-like初始化方案，并设计了残差门控自适应KANs（RGA KANs）架构来缓解发散问题。

Result: 在7个标准前向PDE基准测试中，RGA KANs始终优于参数匹配的cPIKANs和PirateNets，通常高出几个数量级，且在其它方法发散时保持稳定。

Conclusion: RGA KANs通过改进的初始化和架构设计，成功解决了深度cPIKANs的训练不稳定问题，在物理信息机器学习中表现出优越的性能。

Abstract: Since their introduction, Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) have been
successfully applied across several domains, with physics-informed machine
learning (PIML) emerging as one of the areas where they have thrived. In the
PIML setting, Chebyshev-based physics-informed KANs (cPIKANs) have become the
standard due to their computational efficiency. However, like their multilayer
perceptron-based counterparts, cPIKANs face significant challenges when scaled
to depth, leading to training instabilities that limit their applicability to
several PDE problems. To address this, we propose a basis-agnostic, Glorot-like
initialization scheme that preserves activation variance and yields substantial
improvements in stability and accuracy over the default initialization of
cPIKANs. Inspired by the PirateNet architecture, we further introduce
Residual-Gated Adaptive KANs (RGA KANs), designed to mitigate divergence in
deep cPIKANs where initialization alone is not sufficient. Through empirical
tests and information bottleneck analysis, we show that RGA KANs successfully
traverse all training phases, unlike baseline cPIKANs, which stagnate in the
diffusion phase in specific PDE settings. Evaluations on seven standard forward
PDE benchmarks under a fixed training pipeline with adaptive components
demonstrate that RGA KANs consistently outperform parameter-matched cPIKANs and
PirateNets - often by several orders of magnitude - while remaining stable in
settings where the others diverge.

Abstract: Fair graph clustering seeks partitions that respect network structure while
maintaining proportional representation across sensitive groups, with
applications spanning community detection, team formation, resource allocation,
and social network analysis. Many existing approaches enforce rigid constraints
or rely on multi-stage pipelines (e.g., spectral embedding followed by
$k$-means), limiting trade-off control, interpretability, and scalability. We
introduce \emph{DFNMF}, an end-to-end deep nonnegative tri-factorization
tailored to graphs that directly optimizes cluster assignments with a soft
statistical-parity regularizer. A single parameter $\lambda$ tunes the
fairness--utility balance, while nonnegativity yields parts-based factors and
transparent soft memberships. The optimization uses sparse-friendly alternating
updates and scales near-linearly with the number of edges. Across synthetic and
real networks, DFNMF achieves substantially higher group balance at comparable
modularity, often dominating state-of-the-art baselines on the Pareto front.

Result: 从合成函数到多目标优化算法配置的实验表明，Seq-MADAC优于最先进的多智能体强化学习方法，并展现出跨问题类的强泛化能力。

Conclusion: Seq-MADAC为依赖感知的自动化算法配置建立了新范式。

Abstract: Dynamic algorithm configuration (DAC) is a recent trend in automated machine
learning, which can dynamically adjust the algorithm's configuration during the
execution process and relieve users from tedious trial-and-error tuning tasks.
Recently, multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) approaches have improved
the configuration of multiple heterogeneous hyperparameters, making various
parameter configurations for complex algorithms possible. However, many complex
algorithms have inherent inter-dependencies among multiple parameters (e.g.,
determining the operator type first and then the operator's parameter), which
are, however, not considered in previous approaches, thus leading to
sub-optimal results. In this paper, we propose the sequential multi-agent DAC
(Seq-MADAC) framework to address this issue by considering the inherent
inter-dependencies of multiple parameters. Specifically, we propose a
sequential advantage decomposition network, which can leverage action-order
information through sequential advantage decomposition. Experiments from
synthetic functions to the configuration of multi-objective optimization
algorithms demonstrate Seq-MADAC's superior performance over state-of-the-art
MARL methods and show strong generalization across problem classes. Seq-MADAC
establishes a new paradigm for the widespread dependency-aware automated
algorithm configuration. Our code is available at

Abstract: This paper presents an end-to-end multilingual translation pipeline that
integrates a custom U-Net for text detection, the Tesseract engine for text
recognition, and a from-scratch sequence-to-sequence (Seq2Seq) Transformer for
Neural Machine Translation (NMT). Our approach first utilizes a U-Net model,
trained on a synthetic dataset , to accurately segment and detect text regions
from an image. These detected regions are then processed by Tesseract to
extract the source text. This extracted text is fed into a custom Transformer
model trained from scratch on a multilingual parallel corpus spanning 5
languages. Unlike systems reliant on monolithic pre-trained models, our
architecture emphasizes full customization and adaptability. The system is
evaluated on its text detection accuracy, text recognition quality, and
translation performance via BLEU scores. The complete pipeline demonstrates
promising results, validating the viability of a custom-built system for
translating text directly from images.

TL;DR: TAMI是一个处理时序图中异质性交互的新框架，通过时间编码函数和链接历史聚合来改进时序链接预测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 时序图中的交互存在异质性，如少数节点对产生大部分交互事件、交互间隔时间不均等，导致现有方法对不频繁交互节点对的预测效果不佳。

Method: 提出TAMI框架，包含对数时间编码函数(LTE)和链接历史聚合(LHA)两个组件，LTE平衡交互间隔时间编码，LHA防止历史交互被遗忘。

Result: 在13个经典数据集和3个最新TGB数据集上的实验表明，TAMI能持续提升底层模型在转导和归纳设置下的链接预测性能。

Conclusion: TAMI能有效处理时序图中的异质性交互问题，提升链接预测效果，且能与现有最先进的时序图神经网络无缝集成。

Abstract: Temporal graph link prediction aims to predict future interactions between
nodes in a graph based on their historical interactions, which are encoded in
node embeddings. We observe that heterogeneity naturally appears in temporal
interactions, e.g., a few node pairs can make most interaction events, and
interaction events happen at varying intervals. This leads to the problems of
ineffective temporal information encoding and forgetting of past interactions
for a pair of nodes that interact intermittently for their link prediction.
Existing methods, however, do not consider such heterogeneity in their learning
process, and thus their learned temporal node embeddings are less effective,
especially when predicting the links for infrequently interacting node pairs.
To cope with the heterogeneity, we propose a novel framework called TAMI, which
contains two effective components, namely log time encoding function (LTE) and
link history aggregation (LHA). LTE better encodes the temporal information
through transforming interaction intervals into more balanced ones, and LHA
prevents the historical interactions for each target node pair from being
forgotten. State-of-the-art temporal graph neural networks can be seamlessly
and readily integrated into TAMI to improve their effectiveness. Experiment
results on 13 classic datasets and three newest temporal graph benchmark (TGB)
datasets show that TAMI consistently improves the link prediction performance
of the underlying models in both transductive and inductive settings. Our code

### [221] [Lightweight Robust Direct Preference Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23590)
*Cheol Woo Kim,Shresth Verma,Mauricio Tec,Milind Tambe*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了DPO-PRO方法，通过轻量级分布鲁棒优化解决DPO对噪声敏感和过拟合的问题，在保持计算效率的同时提升对噪声偏好信号的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DPO方法虽然稳定简单，但对数据噪声敏感且容易过拟合。现有DRO方法存在过度保守和计算成本高的问题，需要更高效的鲁棒优化方案。

Method: 基于DPO框架，引入轻量级DRO公式处理偏好分布的不确定性，仅关注偏好不确定性避免不必要的保守性，计算开销可忽略。

Result: 在标准对齐基准和真实公共卫生任务上的实验表明，DPO-PRO相比现有DPO变体在噪声偏好信号下具有更好的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: DPO-PRO是一种有效的鲁棒微调算法，通过正则化DPO目标惩罚模型在弱偏好信号下的过度自信，显著提升了对噪声的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has become a popular method for
fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) due to its stability and simplicity.
However, it is also known to be sensitive to noise in the data and prone to
overfitting. Recent works have proposed using distributionally robust
optimization (DRO) to address potential noise and distributional shift in the
data. However, these methods often suffer from excessive conservatism and high
computational cost. We propose DPO-PRO (DPO with Preference Robustness), a
robust fine-tuning algorithm based on DPO which accounts for uncertainty in the
preference distribution through a lightweight DRO formulation. Unlike prior
DRO-based variants, DPO-PRO focuses solely on uncertainty in preferences,
avoiding unnecessary conservatism and incurring negligible computational
overhead. We further show that DPO-PRO is equivalent to a regularized DPO
objective that penalizes model overconfidence under weak preference signals. We
evaluate DPO-PRO on standard alignment benchmarks and a real-world public
health task. Experimental results show that our method consistently improves
robustness to noisy preference signals compared to existing DPO variants.

TL;DR: 提出变分掩码扩散(VMD)框架，通过引入潜在变量来显式建模掩码扩散中令牌间的依赖关系，解决了标准掩码扩散无法有效捕获并发预测令牌间依赖关系的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准掩码扩散模型在离散生成建模中无法有效捕获并发预测令牌间的依赖关系，这导致在令牌依赖关系重要时生成质量下降。

Method: 在掩码扩散过程中引入潜在变量，通过变分推断来显式建模令牌间的依赖关系。

Result: 在合成数据集上成功学习了传统掩码扩散无法捕获的依赖关系；在数独谜题和文本数据集上提高了全局一致性；在多个领域都提升了生成质量和依赖感知能力。

Conclusion: 将变分推断集成到掩码扩散中具有重要价值，VMD框架能够有效提升离散生成建模的性能。

Abstract: Masked diffusion models have recently emerged as a flexible framework for
discrete generative modeling. However, a key limitation of standard masked
diffusion is its inability to effectively capture dependencies among tokens
that are predicted concurrently, leading to degraded generation quality when
dependencies among tokens are important. To explicitly model dependencies among
tokens, we propose Variational Masked Diffusion (VMD), a framework that
introduces latent variables into the masked diffusion process. Through
controlled experiments on synthetic datasets, we demonstrate that VMD
successfully learns dependencies that conventional masked diffusion fails to
capture. We further validate the effectiveness of our approach on Sudoku
puzzles and text datasets, where learning of dependencies among tokens improves
global consistency. Across these domains, VMD enhances both generation quality
and dependency awareness, highlighting the value of integrating variational
inference into masked diffusion. Our code is available at:

Abstract: Caching and prefetching techniques are fundamental to modern computing,
serving to bridge the growing performance gap between processors and memory.
Traditional prefetching strategies are often limited by their reliance on
predefined heuristics or simplified statistical models, which fail to capture
the complex, non-linear dependencies in modern data access patterns. This paper
introduces a modular framework leveraging Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to model
and predict access patterns within graph-structured data, focusing on web
navigation and hierarchical file systems. The toolchain consists of: a route
mapper for extracting structural information, a graph constructor for creating
graph representations, a walk session generator for simulating user behaviors,
and a gnn prefetch module for training and inference. We provide a detailed
conceptual analysis showing how GNN-based approaches can outperform
conventional methods by learning intricate dependencies. This work offers both
theoretical foundations and a practical, replicable pipeline for future
research in graph-driven systems optimization.

*Rohan Senthil,Swee Liang Wong*

Main category: cs.ET

TL;DR: 量子自编码器(QAE)在网络安全异常检测中，特别是在数据有限的情况下，能够超越经典自编码器(CAE)的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 网络安全异常检测面临正常事件远多于异常事件且新异常频繁出现的挑战，经典自编码器在数据有限时表现不佳，而量子对应物可能克服这一限制。

Method: 在BPF扩展跟踪蜜罐数据集上应用量子自编码器，评估多种编码技术、ansatz类型、重复次数和特征选择策略。

Result: 使用Dense-Angle编码和RealAmplitude ansatz的8特征QAE模型在数据有限情况下F1得分为0.87，优于CAE的0.77。

Conclusion: 量子自编码器在数据有限场景下的异常检测中可能提供实际优势。

Abstract: Anomaly detection in cybersecurity is a challenging task, where normal events
far outnumber anomalous ones with new anomalies occurring frequently. Classical
autoencoders have been used for anomaly detection, but struggles in
data-limited settings which quantum counterparts can potentially overcome. In
this work, we apply Quantum Autoencoders (QAEs) for anomaly detection in
cybersecurity, specifically on the BPF-extended tracking honeypot (BETH)
dataset. QAEs are evaluated across multiple encoding techniques, ansatz types,
repetitions, and feature selection strategies. Our results demonstrate that an
8-feature QAE using Dense-Angle encoding with a RealAmplitude ansatz can
outperform Classical Autoencoders (CAEs), even when trained on substantially
fewer samples. The effects of quantum encoding and feature selection for
developing quantum models are demonstrated and discussed. In a data-limited
setting, the best performing QAE model has a F1 score of 0.87, better than that
of CAE (0.77). These findings suggest that QAEs may offer practical advantages
for anomaly detection in data-limited scenarios.

### [225] [Jenga: Responsive Tiered Memory Management without Thrashing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22869)
*Rohan Kadekodi,Haoran Peng,Gilbert Bernstein,Michael D. Ernst,Baris Kasikci*

Main category: cs.ET

TL;DR: Jenga是一个分层内存系统，通过上下文页面分配策略和准确的热度测量，解决了传统分层内存系统中热冷对象混页和热度突变导致的抖动问题，相比之前最佳系统提升了28%的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统分层内存系统存在两个主要问题：(1) 热对象和冷对象被分配在同一页面中；(2) 热度测量的突变会导致页面迁移抖动。这些问题导致系统性能不佳。

Method: Jenga采用新颖的上下文页面分配策略，通过准确测量页面热度，能够及时响应内存访问行为变化，同时避免抖动。

Result: 在快速层容量与工作集大小匹配的情况下，Jenga在10个内存密集型应用中相比之前最佳分层内存系统运行速度快28%，CPU开销小于单核的3%，内存开销小于0.3%。

Conclusion: Jenga通过改进的页面分配策略和热度测量机制，有效解决了分层内存系统中的关键问题，显著提升了系统性能。

Abstract: A heterogeneous memory has a single address space with fast access to some
addresses (a fast tier of DRAM) and slow access to other addresses (a capacity
tier of CXL-attached memory or NVM). A tiered memory system aims to maximize
the number of accesses to the fast tier via page migrations between the fast
and capacity tiers. Unfortunately, previous tiered memory systems can perform
poorly due to (1) allocating hot and cold objects in the same page and (2)
abrupt changes in hotness measurements that lead to thrashing.
  This paper presents Jenga, a tiered memory system that addresses both
problems. Jenga's memory allocator uses a novel context-based page allocation
strategy. Jenga's accurate measurements of page hotness enable it to react to
memory access behavior changes in a timely manner while avoiding thrashing.
Compared to the best previous tiered memory system, Jenga runs memory-intensive
applications 28% faster across 10 applications, when the fast tier capacity
matches the working set size, at a CPU overhead of <3% of a single core and a
memory overhead of <0.3%
