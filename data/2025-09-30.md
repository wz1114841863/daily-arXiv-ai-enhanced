### [1] [ZKProphet: Understanding Performance of Zero-Knowledge Proofs on GPUs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22684)
*Tarunesh Verma,Yichao Yuan,Nishil Talati,Todd Austin*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: ZKProphet：对GPU上零知识证明性能的全面研究，发现NTT内核成为主要瓶颈，占证明生成延迟的90%，并提出通过参数调优和架构优化来提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文献缺乏对ZKP执行瓶颈的系统性分析及其在现代GPU架构上的可扩展性研究，特别是在MSM加速后，其他内核如NTT成为新的性能瓶颈。

Method: 通过系统性性能分析，识别ZKP在GPU上的执行瓶颈，特别是NTT内核的资源利用不足问题，并探索异步计算、内存操作等架构特性的应用。

Result: 发现ZKP的算术运算主要在GPU的32位整数流水线上执行，受限于数据依赖导致的指令级并行性有限，性能受可用整数计算单元限制。

Conclusion: 提出通过运行时参数调优（如预计算输入和替代数据表示）来提取额外加速，为ZKP社区提供在GPU上扩展性能的路线图。

Abstract: Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKP) are protocols which construct cryptographic
proofs to demonstrate knowledge of a secret input in a computation without
revealing any information about the secret. ZKPs enable novel applications in
private and verifiable computing such as anonymized cryptocurrencies and
blockchain scaling and have seen adoption in several real-world systems. Prior
work has accelerated ZKPs on GPUs by leveraging the inherent parallelism in
core computation kernels like Multi-Scalar Multiplication (MSM). However, we
find that a systematic characterization of execution bottlenecks in ZKPs, as
well as their scalability on modern GPU architectures, is missing in the
literature. This paper presents ZKProphet, a comprehensive performance study of
Zero-Knowledge Proofs on GPUs. Following massive speedups of MSM, we find that
ZKPs are bottlenecked by kernels like Number-Theoretic Transform (NTT), as they
account for up to 90% of the proof generation latency on GPUs when paired with
optimized MSM implementations. Available NTT implementations under-utilize GPU
compute resources and often do not employ architectural features like
asynchronous compute and memory operations. We observe that the arithmetic
operations underlying ZKPs execute exclusively on the GPU's 32-bit integer
pipeline and exhibit limited instruction-level parallelism due to data
dependencies. Their performance is thus limited by the available integer
compute units. While one way to scale the performance of ZKPs is adding more
compute units, we discuss how runtime parameter tuning for optimizations like
precomputed inputs and alternative data representations can extract additional
speedup. With this work, we provide the ZKP community a roadmap to scale
performance on GPUs and construct definitive GPU-accelerated ZKPs for their
application requirements and available hardware resources.

### [2] [Analysis of the carbon footprint of HPC](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22679)
*Abdessalam Benhari,Yves Denneulin,Frédéric Desprez,Fanny Dufossé,Denis Trystram*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: 本文分析了高性能计算系统的碳排放演变，通过引入能源结构分析Top500系统，并建立了预测模型来估计未来5年HPC的碳足迹。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高性能计算系统的计算能力持续增长，但伴随而来的能源成本和碳足迹也在不断增加，需要研究其碳排放演变趋势。

Method: 考虑多个大规模系统的全生命周期，引入能源结构分析Top500系统，建立预测模型来估计未来5年HPC的碳足迹。

Result: 提出了一个预测模型，能够估计高性能计算系统在未来5年的碳排放量。

Conclusion: 高性能计算系统的碳排放问题日益重要，需要关注其全生命周期碳足迹，并建立预测模型来指导未来的可持续发展。

Abstract: The demand in computing power has never stopped growing over the years.
Today, the performance of the most powerful systems exceeds the exascale.
Unfortunately, this growth also comes with ever-increasing energy costs,
leading to a high carbon footprint. This paper investigates the evolution of
high performance systems in terms of carbon emissions. A lot of studies focus
on Top500 (and Green500) as the tip of an iceberg to identify trends in the
domain in terms of computing performance. We propose here to go further in
considering the whole span life of several large scale systems and to link the
evolution with trajectory toward 2030. More precisely, we introduce the energy
mix in the analysis of Top500 systems and we derive a predictive model for
estimating the weight of HPC for the next 5 years.

### [3] [TeraAgent: A Distributed Agent-Based Simulation Engine for Simulating Half a Trillion Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24063)
*Lukas Breitwieser,Ahmad Hesam,Abdullah Giray Yağlıkçı,Mohammad Sadrosadati,Fons Rademakers,Onur Mutlu*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: TeraAgent是一个分布式代理仿真引擎，通过定制的序列化机制和增量编码解决了跨服务器代理信息交换的性能瓶颈，实现了万亿级代理的仿真。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有最先进的BioDynaMo平台由于基于共享内存实现，无法跨服务器扩展，限制了大规模复杂系统的仿真能力。

Method: 提出两种解决方案：1）定制序列化机制，允许直接从接收缓冲区访问和修改代理；2）利用代理仿真的迭代特性，通过增量编码减少数据传输。

Result: TeraAgent实现了5000亿代理的仿真（84倍提升），通过增加计算节点减少结果时间，提高了与第三方工具的互操作性，并为用户提供更多硬件灵活性。

Conclusion: TeraAgent克服了现有平台的关键限制，实现了极端规模的分布式代理仿真，为复杂系统研究提供了强大的计算平台。

Abstract: Agent-based simulation is an indispensable paradigm for studying complex
systems. These systems can comprise billions of agents, requiring the computing
resources of multiple servers to simulate. Unfortunately, the state-of-the-art
platform, BioDynaMo, does not scale out across servers due to its
shared-memory-based implementation.
  To overcome this key limitation, we introduce TeraAgent, a distributed
agent-based simulation engine. A critical challenge in distributed execution is
the exchange of agent information across servers, which we identify as a major
performance bottleneck. We propose two solutions: 1) a tailored serialization
mechanism that allows agents to be accessed and mutated directly from the
receive buffer, and 2) leveraging the iterative nature of agent-based
simulations to reduce data transfer with delta encoding.
  Built on our solutions, TeraAgent enables extreme-scale simulations with half
a trillion agents (an 84x improvement), reduces time-to-result with additional
compute nodes, improves interoperability with third-party tools, and provides
users with more hardware flexibility.

### [4] [FLAME: A Serving System Optimized for Large-Scale Generative Recommendation with Efficiency](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22681)
*Xianwen Guo,Bin Huang,Xiaomeng Wu,Guanlin Wu,Fangjian Li,Shijia Wang,Qiang Xiao,Chuanjiang Luo,Yong Li*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: FLAME是一个针对大规模生成式推荐模型的在线服务系统，通过CPU-GPU异构硬件解耦特征预处理和模型计算，包含PDA、FKE和DSO三个优化模块，显著提升系统吞吐量和降低延迟。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成式推荐模型相比传统推荐模型具有更强的扩展能力，但计算负担增加了4个数量级，在保持毫秒级响应时间的同时处理数十亿请求对在线服务系统提出了极高要求。

Method: 使用CPU-GPU异构硬件架构，开发了三个核心模块：PDA（近端数据加速器）优化内存使用，FKE（融合内核引擎）基于TensorRT加速模型计算，DSO（动态流编排器）协调并发请求。

Result: PDA模块实现1.9倍吞吐量提升和1.7倍延迟降低；FKE模块带来4.6-6.1倍加速比和4.7-6.3倍吞吐量提升；DSO模块在非均匀分布下实现1.3倍吞吐量提升和2.3倍加速。

Conclusion: FLAME系统有效支持大规模生成式推荐模型的在线部署，在系统性能方面取得了显著改进。

Abstract: Generative recommendation (GR) models possess greater scaling power compared
to traditional deep learning recommendation models (DLRMs), yet they also
impose a tremendous increase in computational burden. Measured in FLOPs, a
typical GR model's workload sits in $10^9 \sim 10^{11}$ range, roughly four
orders of magnitude higher than traditional DLRMs. Delivering accurate results
in a few tens of milliseconds while processing billions of such requests per
day puts extreme demands on the performance of the online serving system.
Therefore, for industry practitioners, the alluring gains of GR models are
tempered by the formidable challenge of online deployment at scale in
production services. In this work, we introduce a comprehensive solution of
online serving system tailored For Large-scale GenerAtive RecoMmendation with
Efficiency (FLAME). Specifically, we leveraging CPU-GPU heterogeneous hardware
to decouple feature pre-processing and model computation. We encapsulated
several memory optimization features as the Proximal Data Accelerator (PDA)
module to make full use of limited bandwidth and storage resources, which
achieves a 1.9x throughput gain and a 1.7x latency reduction. We implement the
Fused Kernel Engine (FKE) module based on the functionality and interface of
NVIDIA TensorRT to boost model computation, delivering a speedup ratio of
4.6x-6.1x, throughput gain ratio of 4.7x-6.3x one step further. In addition, we
design the Dynamic Stream Orchestrator (DSO) module to coordinate concurrent
requests, enhancing the system throughput performance with 1.3x improvement in
throughput and 2.3x speed-up under non-uniform distribution of upstream
candidates. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that our FLAME effectively
supports large-scale online deployment of GR models and achieves remarkable
improvements in system performance.

Data, the model achieves over 99% accuracy, reducing computational overhead and
improving scheduling latency for constrained tasks. This scalable solution
enables real-time optimization, advancing machine learning integration in
cluster management and paving the way for future adaptive scheduling
strategies.

Conclusion: 研究提出了有效的云资源管理方法，通过动态任务分配和资源优化，能够在维持系统稳定性的同时实现成本最小化。

Abstract: Cloud computing is an established technology allowing users to share
resources on a large scale, never before seen in IT history. A cloud system
connects multiple individual servers in order to process related tasks in
several environments at the same time. Clouds are typically more cost-effective
than single computers of comparable computing performance. The sheer physical
size of the system itself means that thousands of machines may be involved. The
focus of this research was to design a strategy to dynamically allocate tasks
without overloading Cloud nodes which would result in system stability being
maintained at minimum cost. This research has added the following new
contributions to the state of knowledge: (i) a novel taxonomy and
categorisation of three classes of schedulers, namely OS-level, Cluster and Big
Data, which highlight their unique evolution and underline their different
objectives; (ii) an abstract model of cloud resources utilisation is specified,
including multiple types of resources and consideration of task migration
costs; (iii) a virtual machine live migration was experimented with in order to
create a formula which estimates the network traffic generated by this process;
(iv) a high-fidelity Cloud workload simulator, based on a month-long workload
traces from Google's computing cells, was created; (v) two possible approaches
to resource management were proposed and examined in the practical part of the
manuscript: the centralised metaheuristic load balancer and the decentralised
agent-based system. The project involved extensive experiments run on the
University of Westminster HPC cluster, and the promising results are presented
together with detailed discussions and a conclusion.

### [7] [Metadata-Guided Adaptable Frequency Scaling across Heterogeneous Applications and Devices](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22707)
*Jinqi Yan,Fang He,Qianlong Sang,Bifeng Tong,Peng Sun,Yili Gong,Chuang Hu,Dazhao Cheng*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: 提出了MetaDVFS框架，利用元数据引导的多任务强化学习解决异构设备和应用的DVFS问题，显著提升能效和用户体验


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统启发式DVFS调控器无法有效处理异构SoC和多样化应用负载的复杂性，而现有强化学习方法泛化能力差且部署成本高

Method: 将DVFS建模为多任务强化学习问题，利用设备和应用元数据发现和迁移共享知识，开发具有泛化能力的DVFS模型集

Result: 在5款Google Pixel设备和6个应用上测试，PPR提升17%，QoE提升26%，适应速度提高70.8%，性能比独立训练提升5.8-27.6%

Conclusion: MetaDVFS是异构移动环境中DVFS部署的有效且可扩展解决方案，避免了负迁移效应

Abstract: Dynamic Voltage and Frequency Scaling is essential for enhancing energy
efficiency in mobile platforms. However, traditional heuristic-based governors
are increasingly inadequate for managing the complexity of heterogeneous
System-on-Chip designs and diverse application workloads. Although
reinforcement learning approaches offer improved performance, their poor
generalization capability and reliance on extensive retraining for each
hardware and application combination leads to significant deployment costs. In
this work, we observe that device and application metadata inherently
encapsulate valuable knowledge for DVFS, presenting an opportunity to overcome
these limitations. We formulate DVFS for heterogeneous devices and applications
as a multi-task reinforcement learning problem. We introduce MetaDVFS, which is
a metadata-guided framework that systematically leverages metadata to discover
and transfer shared knowledge across DVFS tasks. MetaDVFS can output a set of
DVFS models with significant generalization capability for various applications
of heterogeneous devices. Evaluations on five Google Pixel devices running six
applications show that MetaDVFS achieves up to 17% improvement in
Performance-Power Ratio and up to 26% improvement in Quality of Experience.
Compared to state-of-the-art methods, MetaDVFS delivers 70.8% faster adaptation
and 5.8-27.6% higher performance over standalone device-application specific
training, while avoiding negative transfer effects. These results establish
MetaDVFS as an effective and scalable solution for DVFS deployment in
heterogeneous mobile environments.

*Biyao Zhang,Mingkai Zheng,Debargha Ganguly,Xuecen Zhang,Vikash Singh,Vipin Chaudhary,Zhao Zhang*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: 提出了一种预测大型语言模型端到端训练时间的方法，通过分解LLM为计算原语，结合算子级分解和轻量级采样硬件感知预测模型，在CPU上实现准确预测，无需昂贵的集群实验。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预测数十亿参数模型在数百GPU上的端到端训练时间具有挑战性，现有学习方法需要昂贵采样，而分析方法难以处理现实网络和硬件复杂性。

Method: 将LLM分解为核心计算原语，采用算子级分解进行细粒度分析，使用轻量级采样的硬件感知预测模型，构建端到端预测系统整合这些组件。

Result: 在两个大规模HPC系统上验证，Perlmutter(A100)平均预测误差4.98%，Vista(GH200)平均预测误差9.38%，适用于高达200亿参数模型和128个GPU。

Conclusion: 该方法在CPU上运行，能够快速迭代硬件配置和训练策略，无需昂贵的集群实验，为LLM训练时间预测提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Training Large Language Models(LLMs) is one of the most compute-intensive
tasks in high-performance computing. Predicting end-to-end training time for
multi-billion parameter models distributed across hundreds of GPUs remains
challenging due to complex interactions between transformer components,
parallelism strategies(data, model, pipeline, tensor), and multi-tier
communication. Learned models require costly sampling, while analytical models
often struggle with real-world network and hardware complexities. We address
this by decomposing LLMs into core computational primitives and modeling them
with: (1) operator-level decomposition for fine-grained analysis; (2)
lightweight sampling based hardware-aware prediction models for key operations;
(3) an end-to-end prediction system integrating these components across complex
parallelization strategies. Crucially, our methodology has been validated on
two large-scale HPC systems. Our framework achieves low average prediction
errors-4.98\% on Perlmutter(A100) and 9.38\% on Vista(GH200)-for models up to
20B parameters across 128 GPUs. Importantly, it runs entirely on CPUs, enabling
rapid iteration over hardware configurations and training strategies without
costly on-cluster experimentation.

### [9] [OptimES: Optimizing Federated Learning Using Remote Embeddings for Graph Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22922)
*Pranjal Naman,Yogesh Simmhan*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: 提出了一个优化的联邦图神经网络训练框架OptimES，通过远程邻居剪枝、重叠推送嵌入与本地训练、动态拉取嵌入等策略，显著降低了通信成本和训练时间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界中的图数据通常分布在不同的数据所有者之间，由于隐私问题无法集中聚合。现有的联邦GNN训练方法虽然通过共享边界顶点的远程嵌入来保护隐私，但面临通信成本高、性能受限的问题。

Method: 采用三种优化策略：1) 远程邻居剪枝减少通信量；2) 将嵌入推送到服务器的操作与本地训练重叠进行；3) 动态拉取嵌入机制。在四个大型图数据集上进行了严格评估。

Result: 对于大型密集图（如Reddit和Products），收敛速度比EmbC快约3.5倍，比默认联邦GNN学习准确率提高约16%。对于稀疏图（如Arxiv和Papers），虽然准确率提升有限，但达到目标准确度的速度比EmbC快约11倍。

Conclusion: OptimES框架通过优化通信策略，在保持隐私保护的同时，显著提升了联邦图神经网络训练的效率和性能，特别是在大规模图数据上表现优异。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have experienced rapid advancements in recent
years due to their ability to learn meaningful representations from graph data
structures. However, in most real-world settings, such as financial transaction
networks and healthcare networks, this data is localized to different data
owners and cannot be aggregated due to privacy concerns. Federated Learning
(FL) has emerged as a viable machine learning approach for training a shared
model that iteratively aggregates local models trained on decentralized data.
This addresses privacy concerns while leveraging parallelism. State-of-the-art
methods enhance the privacy-respecting convergence accuracy of federated GNN
training by sharing remote embeddings of boundary vertices through a server
(EmbC). However, they are limited by diminished performance due to large
communication costs. In this article, we propose OptimES, an optimized
federated GNN training framework that employs remote neighbourhood pruning,
overlapping the push of embeddings to the server with local training, and
dynamic pulling of embeddings to reduce network costs and training time. We
perform a rigorous evaluation of these strategies for four common graph
datasets with up to $111M$ vertices and $1.8B$ edges. We see that a modest drop
in per-round accuracy due to the preemptive push of embeddings is out-stripped
by the reduction in per-round training time for large and dense graphs like
Reddit and Products, converging up to $\approx 3.5\times$ faster than EmbC and
giving up to $\approx16\%$ better accuracy than the default federated GNN
learning. While accuracy improvements over default federated GNNs are modest
for sparser graphs like Arxiv and Papers, they achieve the target accuracy
about $\approx11\times$ faster than EmbC.

TL;DR: 对AWS和Azure的三种流行FaaS工作流平台进行大规模评估，通过13.2万次调用运行25个微基准和应用工作流，揭示了函数执行、工作流编排、冷启动扩展和成本等方面的独特见解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: FaaS工作流平台（如AWS Step Functions和Azure Durable Functions）的复杂函数交互和专有平台内部可见性有限，阻碍了对这些平台的深入理解，需要系统性的研究来了解其独特的扩展、性能和成本特性。

Method: 对AWS和Azure的三种流行FaaS工作流平台进行大规模实验评估，运行25个微基准和应用工作流，共计132,000次调用，详细分析函数执行、工作流编排、函数间交互等关键方面。

Result: 研究既证实了一些传统认知，也发现了关于函数执行、工作流编排、函数间交互、冷启动扩展和货币成本的独特见解，这些发现有助于开发者更好地配置和编程这些平台。

Conclusion: 研究结果为开发者提供了配置和编程这些平台的指导，帮助设定性能和可扩展性预期，并识别了增强这些平台的研究空白。

Abstract: Function-as-a-service (FaaS) is a popular serverless computing paradigm for
developing event-driven functions that elastically scale on public clouds. FaaS
workflows, such as AWS Step Functions and Azure Durable Functions, are composed
from FaaS functions, like AWS Lambda and Azure Functions, to build practical
applications. But, the complex interactions between functions in the workflow
and the limited visibility into the internals of proprietary FaaS platforms are
major impediments to gaining a deeper understanding of FaaS workflow platforms.
While several works characterize FaaS platforms to derive such insights, there
is a lack of a principled and rigorous study for FaaS workflow platforms, which
have unique scaling, performance and costing behavior influenced by the
platform design, dataflow and workloads. In this article, we perform extensive
evaluations of three popular FaaS workflow platforms from AWS and Azure,
running 25 micro-benchmark and application workflows over 132k invocations. Our
detailed analysis confirms some conventional wisdom but also uncovers unique
insights on the function execution, workflow orchestration, inter-function
interactions, cold-start scaling and monetary costs. Our observations help
developers better configure and program these platforms, set performance and
scalability expectations, and identify research gaps on enhancing the
platforms.

*Ankita Dutta,Nabendu Chaki,Rajat K. De*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: 本文提出了两种基于流水线并行的DNN训练框架：V-TiMePReSt和I-TiMePReSt。V-TiMePReSt是完全无陈旧性的系统，在所有前向和后向传播阶段使用最新权重；I-TiMePReSt是陈旧感知系统，但不依赖权重存储，通过计算中间权重来平衡陈旧权重和最新权重的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多GPU训练中DNN的高资源需求问题，开发高效的并行训练技术，特别关注流水线并行中的权重陈旧性问题。

Method: V-TiMePReSt：完全无陈旧性的流水线并行系统，确保所有阶段使用最新权重；I-TiMePReSt：陈旧感知系统，基于陈旧程度数学量化陈旧权重的贡献，计算中间权重进行后向传播。

Result: 实验结果显示，V-TiMePReSt在权重参数陈旧程度和GPU内存效率方面优于现有模型；I-TiMePReSt在不移除权重存储的情况下消除权重参数陈旧性，并在GPU内存消耗和收敛速度之间保持良好平衡。

Conclusion: 两种框架各有优势：V-TiMePReSt提供完全无陈旧性的训练，I-TiMePReSt通过数学量化陈旧权重贡献实现了更好的内存-收敛平衡，为DNN并行训练提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: High resource requirement for Deep Neural Network (DNN) training across
multiple GPUs necessitates development of various parallelism techniques. In
this paper, we introduce two interconnected DNN training frameworks, namely,
V-TiMePReSt and I-TiMePReSt, based on pipeline parallelism, a variant of model
parallelism. V-TiMePReSt is a completely staleness-free system which enables
the DNNs to be trained on the latest updated weights in each stage of all
forward and backward passes. Developing staleness-aware systems at the expense
of weight stashing reduces GPU-memory consumption, however, increases the
number of epochs to converge. Thus, we introduce I-TiMePReSt, which is also a
staleness-aware system, but not at the expense of weight stashing. It does not
rely solely on the stale weights or the latest updated weights. I-TiMePReSt
computes an intermediate weight towards the latter and performs backward pass
on it. Additionally, we formulate the significance of the stale weights
mathematically depending on the degree of staleness. In contrast to
V-TiMePReSt, I-TiMePReSt works based on the assumption that stale weights have
a significant contribution in training, which can be quantified mathematically
based on the degree of staleness, although there are other contributory factors
which should not be ignored. Experimental results show that V-TiMePReSt is
advantageous over existing models in terms of $1)$ the extent of staleness of
the weight parameter values and $2)$ GPU memory efficiency, while I-TiMePReSt
is superior in terms of $1)$ removing staleness of the weight parameters
without removing weight stashing and $2)$ maintaining the trade-off between GPU
memory consumption and convergence speed (number of epochs).

Motivation: 移动设备上部署LLM时，小模型性能不足而大模型资源消耗过高。研究发现移动NPU在典型LLM推理中存在计算资源未充分利用的问题，特别是矩阵乘法单元。

Result: 实现了显著加速：混合精度GEMM最高加速19.0倍，Softmax加速2.2倍。更重要的是，使用测试时缩放的小模型能够匹配或超越大模型的准确度，实现了新的性能-成本帕累托前沿。

Conclusion: 通过充分利用移动NPU的未使用计算能力，结合硬件优化的量化方案和高效操作替换，可以在移动设备上实现高性能的LLM推理，使小模型达到大模型的准确度水平，为移动端LLM部署提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Deploying Large Language Models (LLMs) on mobile devices faces the challenge
of insufficient performance in smaller models and excessive resource
consumption in larger ones. This paper highlights that mobile Neural Processing
Units (NPUs) have underutilized computational resources, particularly their
matrix multiplication units, during typical LLM inference. To leverage this
wasted compute capacity, we propose applying parallel test-time scaling
techniques on mobile NPUs to enhance the performance of smaller LLMs. However,
this approach confronts inherent NPU challenges, including inadequate hardware
support for fine-grained quantization and low efficiency in general-purpose
computations. To overcome these, we introduce two key techniques: a
hardware-aware tile quantization scheme that aligns group quantization with NPU
memory access patterns, and efficient LUT-based replacements for complex
operations such as Softmax and dequantization. We design and implement an
end-to-end inference system that leverages the NPU's compute capability to
support test-time scaling on Qualcomm Snapdragon platforms. Experiments show
our approach brings significant speedups: up to 19.0 for mixed-precision GEMM
and 2.2 for Softmax. More importantly, we demonstrate that smaller models using
test-time scaling can match or exceed the accuracy of larger models, achieving
a new performance-cost Pareto frontier.

Result: 在长上下文和异构场景中，SLO达成率平均提升43%，吞吐量最高提升3倍，并在FlowGPT生产环境中验证了其优势。

Conclusion: SynergySched通过跨层预测性编排，成功解决了LLM推理服务中的系统效率问题，实现了从反应式负载均衡到预测式编排的转变。

Abstract: LLM inference serving typically scales out with a two-tier architecture: a
cluster router distributes requests to multiple inference engines, each of
which then in turn performs its own internal scheduling. However, this commonly
used paradigm suffers from critical, systemic inefficiency caused by the
information gaps across two layers. At the cluster-layer, the router mainly
relies on lagging, coarse-grained metrics, such as average latency and queue
length to make decisions, resulting in "decision lag" that leads to suboptimal
request routing. At the engine-layer, static heuristic scheduling policies
cannot effectively handle the dynamic workloads, leading a poor balance between
latency and throughput. Besides, these gaps may cause SLO violations and
resource waste, especially in heterogeneous cloud environments.
  To bridge such gaps, we propose SynergySched, a cross-layer framework that
shifts LLM serving system from reactive load balancing to predictive
orchestration. The core of SynergySched lies in a structurally-informed online
performance model that provides accurate, forward-looking per-step latency and
capacity estimations. This model empowers two key components. At the
engine-layer, LENS performs SLO-aware, adaptive scheduling, dynamically
optimizing batching to meet SLOs under real-time loads. At the cluster-layer,
PRISM uses predictive signals to perform state-driven routing, maximizing
cluster-wide performance and SLO attainment. Performance evaluations show that
SynergySched improves SLO attainment by 43% on average and achieves up to 3x
throughput speedup in long-context and heterogeneous scenarios. Besides, we
also deploy SynergySched on FlowGPT's clusters to demonstrate its advantages in
production environment.

Conclusion: 该三阶段优化策略有效解决了联邦学习的通信瓶颈问题，为资源受限环境下的联邦学习部署提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables participant devices to collaboratively train
deep learning models without sharing their data with the server or other
devices, effectively addressing data privacy and computational concerns.
However, FL faces a major bottleneck due to high communication overhead from
frequent model updates between devices and the server, limiting deployment in
resource-constrained wireless networks. In this paper, we propose a three-fold
strategy. Firstly, an Adaptive Feature-Elimination Strategy to drop less
important features while retaining high-value ones; secondly, Adaptive Gradient
Innovation and Error Sensitivity-Based Quantization, which dynamically adjusts
the quantization level for innovative gradient compression; and thirdly,
Communication Frequency Optimization to enhance communication efficiency. We
evaluated our proposed model's performance through extensive experiments,
assessing accuracy, loss, and convergence compared to baseline techniques. The
results show that our model achieves high communication efficiency in the
framework while maintaining accuracy.

Abstract: This paper introduces Lyquor, a decentralized platform that reimagines
blockchain infrastructure through a service-centric model where nodes
selectively host smart contracts (called Lyquids) while preserving global
composability. We present three key innovations: (1) Fate-Constrained Ordering
(FCO), which decouples consensus from execution to enable selective hosting
without sacrificing Layer-1 grade composability; (2) Direct Memory Architecture
(DMA), which eliminates state access bottlenecks by providing each contract
with persistent, byte-addressable virtual memory; and (3) Universal Procedure
Call (UPC), which enables fault-tolerant, programmable coordination across
distributed off-chain computation. Together, these components are powered by a
Rust-macroed unified programming model where on-chain and off-chain logic
coexist seamlessly, supporting both traditional smart contract patterns and
novel distributed applications. Lyquor addresses critical limitations in
existing systems while maintaining compatibility with Ethereum APIs, offering a
path toward truly scalable decentralized computation.

Motivation: 单边交叉最小化问题在图形绘制和VLSI设计中有重要应用，但现有精确和固定参数可处理算法的并行化研究不足，并行化具有扩展到更大图的潜力。

Method: 探索了多种先前研究的精确和固定参数可处理算法，实现了它们的顺序和并行版本，并进行实证分析。

Conclusion: 并行化能够显著提升单边交叉最小化算法的性能，但线性加速比并不总是能够实现，需要进一步研究其原因。

Abstract: The One Sided Crossing Minimization (OSCM) problem is an optimization problem
in graph drawing that aims to minimize the number of edge crossings in
bipartite graph layouts. It has practical applications in areas such as network
visualization and VLSI (Very Large Scale Integration) design, where reducing
edge crossings improves the arrangement of circuit components and their
interconnections. Despite the rise of multi-core systems, the parallelization
of exact and fixed-parameter tractable (FPT) algorithms for OSCM remains
largely unexplored. Parallel variants offer significant potential for scaling
to larger graphs but require careful handling of synchronization and memory
management. In this paper, we explore various previously studied exact and FPT
algorithms for OSCM, implementing and analyzing them in both sequential and
parallel forms. Our main contribution lies in empirically proving that these
algorithms can achieve close to linear speedup under parallelization. In
particular, our best result achieves a speedup of nearly 19 on a 16-core,
32-thread machine. We further investigate and discuss the reasons why linear
speedup is not always attained.

Motivation: 现有流水线并行方法忽视了模型分区、模型放置和工作负载调度的协同优化，导致效率提升有限甚至性能下降。模型架构的异构性加剧了流水线气泡问题。

Method: 1) 开发流水线性能模型准确估计训练吞吐量；2) 基于性能模型联合优化模型分区、模型放置和工作负载调度策略；3) 设计统一流水线执行器支持多样化流水线策略执行。

Result: 实验表明AdaPtis相比Megatron-LM I-1F1B在各种LLM架构和规模上平均加速1.42倍，最高可达2.14倍。

Conclusion: AdaPtis通过自适应流水线并行有效解决了LLM训练中的效率问题，显著提升了训练性能。

Abstract: Pipeline parallelism is widely used to train large language models (LLMs).
However, increasing heterogeneity in model architectures exacerbates pipeline
bubbles, thereby reducing training efficiency. Existing approaches overlook the
co-optimization of model partition, model placement, and workload scheduling,
resulting in limited efficiency improvement or even performance degradation. To
respond, we propose AdaPtis, an LLM training system that supports adaptive
pipeline parallelism. First, we develop a pipeline performance model to
accurately estimate training throughput. Second, AdaPtis jointly optimizes
model partition, model placement, and workload scheduling policies guided by
this performance model. Third, we design a unified pipeline executor that
efficiently supports the execution of diverse pipeline strategies. Extensive
experiments show that AdaPtis achieves an average speedup of 1.42x (up to
2.14x) over Megatron-LM I-1F1B across various LLM architectures and scales.

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate three cross-facility data streaming

Service Streaming (MSS). We examine their architectural variations in data flow
paths and deployment feasibility, and detail their implementation using the
Data Streaming to HPC (DS2HPC) architectural framework and the SciStream
memory-to-memory streaming toolkit on the production-grade Advanced Computing
Ecosystem (ACE) infrastructure at Oak Ridge Leadership Computing Facility

three synthetic workloads derived from the streaming characteristics of
scientific workflows. Through simulated experiments, we measure streaming
throughput, round-trip time, and overhead under work sharing, work sharing with
feedback, and broadcast and gather messaging patterns commonly found in AI-HPC
communication motifs. Our study shows that DTS offers a minimal-hop path,
resulting in higher throughput and lower latency, whereas MSS provides greater
deployment feasibility and scalability across multiple users but incurs
significant overhead. PRS lies in between, offering a scalable architecture
whose performance matches DTS in most cases.

TL;DR: REDServe是一个高效的多模态模型推理系统，通过解耦编码模块和语言模型，采用细粒度调度方法在单请求内重叠多模态编码与语言模型前向计算，并在多请求间使用可调度token和token预算来平衡计算负载，显著提升了推理性能。

Motivation: 传统多模态模型服务引擎将编码模块和语言模型共置，导致严重的资源干扰和数据依赖问题。现有的解耦方法未能充分利用请求内和请求间的并行性。

Method: 基于解耦架构，采用细粒度调度方法：在单请求内重叠多模态编码与语言模型前向计算；在多请求间使用可调度token和token预算平衡计算负载；结合分块预填充实现新颖的调度策略。

Result: 在代表性多模态模型上的实验评估显示，REDServe实现了高达66%的延迟降低和109%的吞吐量提升，显著优于现有服务方法。

Conclusion: REDServe通过有效协调请求内和请求间流水线，显著提升了多模态模型推理的效率和性能，为解决多模态模型服务挑战提供了有效方案。

Abstract: Large multimodal models (LMMs) typically employ an encoding module to
transform multimodal data inputs into embeddings, which are then fed to
language models for further processing. However, efficiently serving LMMs
remains highly challenging due to the inherent complexity of their inference
pipelines. Traditional serving engines co-locate the encoding module and the
language model, leading to significant resource interference and tight data
dependency. Recent studies have alleviated this issue by disaggregating the
encoding module from the model, following a design style of prefill-decode
disaggregation. Nevertheless, these approaches fail to fully exploit
parallelism both within individual requests (intra-request) and across multiple
requests (inter-request).
  To overcome the limitation, we propose REDServe, an LMM inference system that
efficiently orchestrates intra- and inter-request pipelines. REDServe is
designed to reduce low latency and maximize parallelism at both intra- and
inter-request granularities. Built on the disaggregated architecture of the
encoding module and language model, REDServe adopts a fine-grained scheduling
method that overlaps multimodal encoding with the forward computation of the
language model within a single request. For inter-request pipeline, REDServe
leverages schedulable tokens and token budgets to balance computational loads
across micro-batches. Combined with chunked prefill, this enables a novel
scheduling strategy that coordinates the execution of intra- and inter-request
pipelines. Experimental evaluations on representative LMMs show that REDServe
achieves substantial latency reduction of up to 66% while improving throughput
by up to 109%, significantly outperforming existing serving approaches.

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: SparseServe是一个LLM服务系统，通过高效的HBM-DRAM分层管理解决动态稀疏注意力算法中的HBM容量瓶颈问题，显著提升长上下文LLM的服务性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 动态稀疏注意力算法虽然减少了注意力计算成本，但将性能瓶颈从HBM带宽转移到了HBM容量，因为未选中的KV缓存仍需保留在HBM中，限制了并行批处理大小。

Method: 提出三个关键创新：1) 碎片感知KV缓存传输，通过GPU直接加载和CPU辅助保存加速HBM-DRAM数据传输；2) 工作集感知批处理大小控制，基于实时工作集估计调整批大小；3) 分层分段预填充，将预填充阶段的HBM使用限制在单个层内。

Result: 实验结果显示，SparseServe相比最先进的LLM服务系统，实现了高达9.26倍更低的首令牌时间延迟和高达3.14倍更高的令牌生成吞吐量。

Conclusion: SparseServe通过高效的HBM-DRAM分层管理成功解锁了动态稀疏注意力算法的并行潜力，显著提升了长上下文LLM的服务效率。

Abstract: Serving long-context LLMs is costly because attention computation grows
linearly with context length. Dynamic sparse attention algorithms (DSAs)
mitigate this by attending only to the key-value (KV) cache of critical tokens.
However, with DSAs, the main performance bottleneck shifts from HBM bandwidth
to HBM capacity: KV caches for unselected tokens must remain in HBM for
low-latency decoding, constraining parallel batch size and stalling further
throughput gains. Offloading these underutilized KV caches to DRAM could free
HBM capacity, allowing larger parallel batch sizes. Yet, achieving such
hierarchical HBM-DRAM storage raises new challenges, including fragmented KV
cache access, HBM cache contention, and high HBM demands of hybrid batching,
that remain unresolved in prior work.
  This paper proposes SparseServe, an LLM serving system that unlocks the
parallel potential of DSAs through efficient hierarchical HBM-DRAM management.
SparseServe introduces three key innovations to address the challenges
mentioned above: (1) fragmentation-aware KV cache transfer, which accelerates
HBM-DRAM data movement through GPU-direct loading (FlashH2D) and CPU-assisted
saving (FlashD2H); (2) working-set-aware batch size control that adjusts batch
sizes based on real-time working set estimation to minimize HBM cache
thrashing; (3) layer-segmented prefill that bounds HBM use during prefill to a
single layer, enabling efficient execution even for long prompts. Extensive
experimental results demonstrate that SparseServe achieves up to 9.26x lower
mean time-to-first-token (TTFT) latency and up to 3.14x higher token generation
throughput compared to state-of-the-art LLM serving systems.

Conclusion: Hapt框架能够有效缓解通信开销，在异构加速器间保持负载均衡，并在跨集群互连下最大化计算-通信重叠，同时仅产生最小的内存开销。

Abstract: With the rapid evolution of GPU architectures, the heterogeneity of model
training infrastructures is steadily increasing. In such environments,
effectively utilizing all available heterogeneous accelerators becomes critical
for distributed model training. However, existing frameworks, which are
primarily designed for homogeneous clusters, often exhibit significant resource
underutilization when deployed on heterogeneous accelerators and networks. In
this paper, we present Hapt, an automated parallel training framework designed
specifically for heterogeneous clusters. Hapt introduces a fine-grained planner
that efficiently searches a wide space for the inter-operator parallel
strategy, enabling Hapt to alleviate communication overheads while maintaining
balanced loads across heterogeneous accelerators. In addition, Hapt implements
a heterogeneity-aware 1F1B scheduler that adaptively adjusts the execution
timing and ordering of microbatches based on network characteristics,
maximizing computation-communication overlap under cross-cluster interconnects
while incurring only minimal memory overhead. Our evaluation results show that
Hapt can deliver 1.3x-1.6x higher performance on heterogeneous clusters than
state-of-the-art training frameworks.

Abstract: We introduce Fed-Span, a novel federated/distributed learning framework
designed for low Earth orbit satellite constellations. By leveraging
graph-theoretic principles, Fed-Span addresses critical challenges inherent to
distributed learning in dynamic satellite networks, including intermittent
satellite connectivity, heterogeneous computational capabilities of satellites,
and time-varying satellites' datasets. At its core, Fed-Span builds upon
minimum spanning tree (MST) and minimum spanning forest (MSF) topologies,
enabling spanning model aggregation and dispatching processes for distributed
learning. To formalize Fed-Span, we offer a fresh perspective on MST/MSF
topologies by formulating them through a set of continuous constraint
representations (CCRs), thereby devising graph-theoretical abstractions into an
optimizable framework for satellite networks. Using these CCRs, we obtain the
energy consumption and latency of operations in Fed-Span. Moreover, we derive
novel convergence bounds for non-convex machine learning loss functions,
accommodating the key system characteristics and degrees of freedom of
Fed-Span. Finally, we propose a comprehensive optimization problem that jointly
minimizes model prediction loss, energy consumption, and latency of Fed-Span.
We unveil that this problem is NP-hard and develop a systematic approach to
transform it into a geometric programming formulation, solved via successive
convex optimization with performance guarantees. Through evaluations on
real-world datasets, we demonstrate that Fed-Span outperforms existing methods,
with faster model convergence, greater energy efficiency, and reduced latency.
These results highlight Fed-Span as a novel solution for efficient distributed
learning in satellite networks.

Motivation: 稀疏专家混合模型在分布式部署中面临两个关键挑战：1）通信问题-特征传输到激活专家设备产生显著通信开销；2）计算负载问题-专家激活不均衡导致GPU负载不平衡。其中通信开销被确定为SMoE推理的主要瓶颈。

Method: GRACE-MoE框架包含两个关键阶段：1）分组与复制：基于专家亲和性分组以减少跨设备通信，应用动态复制解决负载倾斜；2）路由：采用具有负载预测的局部感知路由策略，优先使用本地副本最小化通信，必要时在远程副本间平衡请求。

Result: 在多样化模型和多节点多GPU环境中的实验表明，GRACE-MoE能有效减少端到端推理延迟，相比最先进系统实现高达3.79倍的加速。

Conclusion: GRACE-MoE通过协同优化通信和计算负载，成功解决了SMoE分布式推理中的关键瓶颈问题，显著提升了推理效率。

Abstract: Sparse Mixture of Experts (SMoE) performs conditional computation by
selectively activating a subset of experts, thereby enabling scalable parameter
growth in large language models (LLMs). However, the expanded parameter scale
exceeds the memory capacity of a single device, necessitating distributed
deployment for inference. This setup introduces two critical challenges: (1)
Communication Issue: Transferring features to devices with activated experts
leads to significant communication overhead. (2) Computational Load Issue:
Skewed expert activation overloads certain GPUs, resulting in load imbalance
across devices. Among these, communication overhead is identified as the main
bottleneck in SMoE inference. Nevertheless, reducing communication between
devices may exacerbate computational load imbalance, leading to device idleness
and resource waste. Therefore, we present GRACE-MoE, short for Grouping and
Replication with Locality-Aware Routing for SMoE inference. GRACE-MoE is a
co-optimization framework that jointly reduces communication overhead and
alleviates computational load imbalance. Specifically, the framework comprises
two key phases: (1) Grouping & Replication: This phase groups experts based on
their affinity to reduce cross-device communication. Additionally, dynamic
replication is applied to address load skew, improving computational load
balance across GPUs. (2) Routing: This phase employs a locality-aware routing
strategy with load prediction. It prioritizes local replicas to minimize
communication overhead and balances requests across remote replicas when
necessary. Experiments on diverse models and multi-node, multi-GPU environments
demonstrate that GRACE-MoE efficiently reduces end-to-end inference latency,
achieving up to 3.79x speedup over state-of-the-art systems. Code for GRACE-MoE
will be released upon acceptance.

Motivation: DIGC在Vision GNN中占用了超过50%的推理延迟，在高分辨率图像下甚至达到95%，成为主要计算瓶颈，而现有优化方法往往牺牲了DIGC的灵活性、准确性或通用性。

Method: 设计了一个流式、深度流水线的FPGA加速器，采用片上缓冲器以小块均匀块处理输入特征，通过局部计算最小化外部内存流量，并使用局部归并排序和全局k路合并的并行排序方法。

Result: 该设计能够无缝扩展到不同图像分辨率、ViG层类型和模型规模，在布局布线后实现高时钟频率，相比优化的CPU和GPU DIGC基线分别实现了16.6倍和6.8倍的加速比。

Conclusion: 提出的FPGA加速器有效解决了DIGC的计算瓶颈问题，同时保持了灵活性、准确性和通用性，为Vision GNN的实际应用提供了高效的硬件解决方案。

Abstract: Vision Graph Neural Networks (Vision GNNs, or ViGs) represent images as
unstructured graphs, achieving state of the art performance in computer vision
tasks such as image classification, object detection, and instance
segmentation. Dynamic Image Graph Construction (DIGC) builds image graphs by
connecting patches (nodes) based on feature similarity, and is dynamically
repeated in each ViG layer following GNN based patch (node) feature updates.
However, DIGC constitutes over 50% of end to end ViG inference latency, rising
to 95% at high image resolutions, making it the dominant computational
bottleneck. While hardware acceleration holds promise, prior works primarily
optimize graph construction algorithmically, often compromising DIGC
flexibility, accuracy, or generality. To address these limitations, we propose
a streaming, deeply pipelined FPGA accelerator for DIGC, featuring on chip
buffers that process input features in small, uniform blocks. Our design
minimizes external memory traffic via localized computation and performs
efficient parallel sorting with local merge sort and global k way merging
directly on streaming input blocks via heap insertion. This modular
architecture scales seamlessly across image resolutions, ViG layer types, and
model sizes and variants, and supports DIGC across diverse ViG based vision
backbones. The design achieves high clock frequencies post place and route due
to the statically configured parallelism minimizing critical path delay and
delivers up to 16.6x and 6.8x speedups over optimized CPU and GPU DIGC
baselines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型的普及，在资源受限的边缘设备上进行长上下文推理需求增加，但由于标准注意力机制的二次复杂度与边缘加速器的内存和计算模式不匹配，部署面临挑战。

Method: 在现代NPU上对各种因果推理算子进行全面的性能分析，基准测试标准二次注意力与多种次二次替代方法（包括结构化状态空间和线性注意力模型）。

Result: 分析显示次二次方法具有更好的可扩展性，但在NPU专用执行单元上引入不同的计算瓶颈。二次注意力在长上下文下严重受内存限制，缓存效率低下，流水线停顿超过95%；而次二次模型可能在可编程向量核心上受计算限制。

Conclusion: 这些发现为硬件感知模型和优化策略的协同设计提供了关键见解，以实现设备上的长上下文AI推理。

Abstract: The proliferation of large language models (LLMs) has driven demand for long
context inference on resource constrained edge devices. However, deploying
these models on Neural Processing Units (NPUs) presents significant challenges
due to the architectural mismatch: quadratic complexity of standard attention
mechanisms conflicts with memory and compute patterns of edge accelerators.
This paper presents a comprehensive performance analysis of various causal
inference operators on a modern NPU. We benchmark standard quadratic attention
against several sub-quadratic alternatives, including structured state-space
and linear attention models. Our analysis reveals that while sub-quadratic
methods offer superior scalability, they introduce distinct computational
bottlenecks on the NPU's specialized execution units. We identify that
quadratic attention becomes severely memory-bound, suffering from cache
inefficiency and pipeline stalls exceeding 95% at long contexts. In contrast,
sub-quadratic models can become compute-bound on programmable vector cores.
These findings provide critical insights for the co-design of hardware-aware
models and optimization strategies to enable on-device AI inference with
long-contexts.

TL;DR: PATCH是一种混合稀疏框架，通过将权重矩阵划分为块，让每个块选择为密集或2:4稀疏，实现0%-50%之间的连续稀疏率，在保持精度的同时提供实际加速效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有模型剪枝方法面临两难：非结构化稀疏保持精度但无法GPU加速，而2:4稀疏硬件友好但固定的50%模式会降低模型质量。需要一种能平衡精度与加速的灵活稀疏方法。

Method: 将权重矩阵划分为块，通过可学习的掩码选择机制为每个块分配密集或2:4稀疏模式，支持跨层非均匀稀疏和细粒度精度-加速权衡控制。

Result: 在0.5B到8B参数模型上，PATCH持续缩小与密集模型的精度差距，在LLaMA-2 7B上实现1.18x-1.38x端到端加速，相比最先进的2:4剪枝方法MaskLLM精度提升0.37%-2.96%。

Conclusion: PATCH框架成功弥合了精度保持与硬件加速之间的差距，为大型语言模型部署提供了有效的稀疏解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) deliver impressive performance but incur
prohibitive memory and compute costs at deployment. Model pruning is an
effective way to reduce these overheads, yet existing approaches face
challenges: unstructured sparsity, where nonzeros can appear anywhere,
preserves accuracy but yields irregular access patterns that prevent GPU
acceleration, while semi-structured 2:4 sparsity is hardware-friendly but
enforces a rigid 50% pattern that degrades model quality. To bridge this gap,
we introduce PATCH, a hybrid sparsity framework that enables a continuous
sparsity ratio between 0% and 50%. PATCH partitions weight matrices into tiles,
assigning each tile to be either dense or 2:4 sparse via a learnable mask
selection mechanism. This design provides fine-grained control over
accuracy-acceleration tradeoffs and supports non-uniform sparsity across
layers, leading to superior overall quality. Across models from 0.5B to 8B
parameters, PATCH consistently narrows the gap to dense accuracy while
delivering practical speedups. For instance, on LLaMA-2 7B with an A6000 GPU,
PATCH achieves 1.18x-1.38x end-to-end speedup over dense baselines while
improving accuracy by 0.37%-2.96% compared to the state-of-the-art 2:4 pruning
method, MaskLLM.

*Pavan Reddy,Aditya Sanjay Gujral*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文系统评估了局部对抗攻击的效果，发现相比全局攻击，局部攻击具有更低的像素扰动和更高的图像质量指标，但计算成本更高且攻击成功率略有下降。迭代方法比单步方法对局部化约束更具鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统对抗攻击主要关注全局扰动，而局部对抗噪声的潜力尚未充分探索。本研究旨在系统评估局部对抗攻击的有效性、不可感知性和计算效率。

Method: 通过引入二元掩码将噪声限制在特定区域，在FGSM、PGD和C&W等广泛使用的方法上评估局部对抗攻击，量化其效果、不可感知性和计算效率。

Result: 局部攻击相比全局攻击实现了显著更低的平均像素扰动、更高的峰值信噪比和结构相似性指数。但代价是计算量增加和攻击成功率略有下降。迭代方法比单步方法对局部化约束更具鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 本研究提供了局部对抗攻击的全面分析，为推进攻击策略和设计鲁棒防御系统提供了实用见解。

Abstract: Adversarial attacks in machine learning traditionally focus on global
perturbations to input data, yet the potential of localized adversarial noise
remains underexplored. This study systematically evaluates localized
adversarial attacks across widely-used methods, including FGSM, PGD, and C&W,
to quantify their effectiveness, imperceptibility, and computational
efficiency. By introducing a binary mask to constrain noise to specific
regions, localized attacks achieve significantly lower mean pixel
perturbations, higher Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratios (PSNR), and improved
Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) compared to global attacks. However, these
benefits come at the cost of increased computational effort and a modest
reduction in Attack Success Rate (ASR). Our results highlight that iterative
methods, such as PGD and C&W, are more robust to localization constraints than
single-step methods like FGSM, maintaining higher ASR and imperceptibility
metrics. This work provides a comprehensive analysis of localized adversarial
attacks, offering practical insights for advancing attack strategies and
designing robust defensive systems.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文提出了情境持续学习(ICCL)，通过任务调度和提示重排使大语言模型具备持续学习能力，发现其保留特性与人类分布式练习相似，并提出了衡量学习算法与人类保留相似度的指标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究大语言模型在连续多任务环境中的长期保留和跨任务知识积累能力，探索其是否能够像人类一样通过分布式练习实现持续学习。

Method: 提出情境持续学习(ICCL)框架，通过任务调度和提示重排实现无需参数更新的持续学习，在马尔可夫链基准上进行实验，并提出了人类保留相似度指标。

Result: 实验表明ICCL受益于分布式练习，存在保留的"甜蜜点"；线性注意力模型如MAMBA和RWKV展现出与人类相似的保留模式，尽管其保留性能不如基于Transformer的LLMs。

Conclusion: ICCL既具有认知合理性又实用有效，提供了一种仅通过推理的持续学习范式，缓解了灾难性遗忘并解决了传统CL方法中的稳定性-可塑性困境。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can adapt to new tasks via in-context learning
(ICL) without parameter updates, making them powerful learning engines for fast
adaptation. While extensive research has examined ICL as a few-shot learner,
whether it can achieve long-term retention and cross-task knowledge
accumulation when multitasks arrive sequentially remains underexplored.
Motivated by human memory studies, we investigate the retention characteristics
of ICL in multitask settings and extend it to in-context continual learning
(ICCL), where continual learning ability emerges through task scheduling and
prompt rearrangement. Experiments on Markov-Chain benchmarks demonstrate that,
for specific large-language models, ICCL benefits from distributed practice
(DP) in a manner analogous to humans, consistently revealing a spacing "sweet
spot" for retention. Beyond retention performance, we propose a human-retention
similarity metric to quantify how closely a continual-learning (CL) method
aligns with human retention dynamics. Using this metric, we show that
linear-attention models such as MAMBA and RWKV exhibit particularly human-like
retention patterns, despite their retention performance lagging behind that of
Transformer-based LLMs. Overall, our results establish ICCL as both cognitively
plausible and practically effective, providing an inference-only CL paradigm
that mitigates catastrophic forgetting and addresses the stability-plasticity
dilemma in conventional CL methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决异构模型架构在协作学习中的互操作性和隐私保护挑战。

Method: 采用通用融合层输出维度，将模型分为个性化基础块和通用模块块，客户端共享融合层输出而非模型参数。

Result: 相比联邦学习和联邦分割学习基线，该框架实现了更优的通信效率，同时在异构架构上保持稳定的训练性能。

Conclusion: 该框架有效解决了异构模型协作学习的通信效率和隐私保护问题，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Collaborative learning across heterogeneous model architectures presents
significant challenges in ensuring interoperability and preserving privacy. We
propose a communication-efficient distributed learning framework that supports
model heterogeneity and enables modular composition during inference. To
facilitate interoperability, all clients adopt a common fusion-layer output
dimension, which permits each model to be partitioned into a personalized base
block and a generalized modular block. Clients share their fusion-layer
outputs, keeping model parameters and architectures private. Experimental
results demonstrate that the framework achieves superior communication
efficiency compared to federated learning (FL) and federated split learning
(FSL) baselines, while ensuring stable training performance across
heterogeneous architectures.

### [30] [On the Capacity of Self-Attention](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22840)
*Micah Adler*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文分析了自注意力机制的容量限制，提出了关系图识别框架，推导出容量缩放定律：D_K = Θ(m' log m' / d_model)，并证明多头注意力在压缩嵌入情况下能缓解关系干扰。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然已知自注意力能学习token间的关系，但缺乏对其容量的形式化理解：在给定预算下，单层能可靠恢复多少种不同关系？

Method: 引入关系图识别(RGR)框架，将键-查询通道表示为具有m'条有向边的图，分析信息论下界和显式构造，并通过受控单层实验验证理论。

Result: 推导出容量缩放定律D_K = Θ(m' log m' / d_model)，证明在压缩嵌入(m > d_model)时，多头注意力比单头能恢复更多关系，实验显示性能阈值与预测容量缩放一致。

Conclusion: 结果为自注意力容量提供了具体缩放定律，并为跨头分配键-查询预算提供了原则性设计规则。

Abstract: While self-attention is known to learn relations among tokens, we lack a
formal understanding of its capacity: how many distinct relations can a single
layer reliably recover for a given budget?
  To formalize this, we introduce Relational Graph Recognition (RGR), where the
key-query channel represents a graph on $m$ items with $m'$ directed edges,
and, given a context of items, must recover the neighbors of each item. We
measure resources by the total key dimension $D_K = h\,d_k$. Within this
framework, we analytically derive a capacity scaling law and validate it
empirically. We show that $D_K = \Theta(m' \log m' / d_{\text{model}})$ is both
necessary (information-theoretic lower bound) and sufficient (explicit
construction) in a broad class of graphs to recover $m'$ relations. This
scaling law directly leads to a new, capacity-based rationale for multi-head
attention that applies even when each item only attends to a single target.
When embeddings are uncompressed ($m = d_{\text{model}}$) and the graph is a
permutation, a single head suffices. However, compression ($m >
d_{\text{model}}$) forces relations into overlapping subspaces, creating
interference that a single large head cannot disentangle. Our analysis shows
that allocating a fixed $D_K$ across many small heads mitigates this
interference, increasing the number of recoverable relations. Controlled
single-layer experiments mirror the theory, revealing a sharp performance
threshold that matches the predicted capacity scaling and confirms the benefit
of distributing $D_K$ across multiple heads.
  Altogether, these results provide a concrete scaling law for self-attention
capacity and a principled design rule for allocating key-query budget across
heads.

Motivation: 结构化数据中的对抗鲁棒性研究相对不足，需要专门针对表格数据的攻击方法来揭示其安全漏洞。

Method: 采用黑盒决策攻击，结合无梯度方向估计和迭代边界搜索，能够高效处理离散和连续特征空间。

Result: 攻击成功率超过90%，几乎能攻破所有测试模型，包括传统机器学习分类器和基于大语言模型的流水线，且每个实例仅需少量查询。

Conclusion: 表格模型对对抗扰动存在严重脆弱性，现实世界决策系统迫切需要更强的防御机制。

Abstract: Adversarial robustness in structured data remains an underexplored frontier
compared to vision and language domains. In this work, we introduce a novel
black-box, decision-based adversarial attack tailored for tabular data. Our
approach combines gradient-free direction estimation with an iterative boundary
search, enabling efficient navigation of discrete and continuous feature spaces
under minimal oracle access. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method
successfully compromises nearly the entire test set across diverse models,
ranging from classical machine learning classifiers to large language model
(LLM)-based pipelines. Remarkably, the attack achieves success rates
consistently above 90%, while requiring only a small number of queries per
instance. These results highlight the critical vulnerability of tabular models
to adversarial perturbations, underscoring the urgent need for stronger
defenses in real-world decision-making systems.

Conclusion: 通过偏好之间的偏好监督可以有效地推断自适应边界，提出的两种采样策略能够根据目标（判别或生成性能）来平衡这种权衡。

Abstract: Margin-based optimization is fundamental to improving generalization and
robustness in classification tasks. In the context of reward model learning
from preferences within Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF),
existing methods typically rely on no margins, fixed margins, or margins that
are simplistic functions of preference ratings. However, such formulations
often fail to account for the varying strengths of different preferences, for
example some preferences are associated with larger margins between responses,
or they rely on noisy margin information derived from ratings. We argue that
modeling the strength of preferences can lead to better generalization and more
faithful alignment. Furthermore, many existing methods that use adaptive
margins assume access to accurate preference scores, which can be difficult for
humans to provide reliably. We propose an approach that leverages preferences
over preferences, that is annotations indicating which of two preferences
reflects a stronger distinction. We use this ordinal signal to infer adaptive
margins on a per-datapoint basis. We introduce an extension to Direct
Preference Optimization (DPO), DPO-PoP, that incorporates adaptive margins from
preference-over-preference supervision, enabling improved discriminative and
generative performance. Empirically, our method outperforms vanilla DPO, DPO
with fixed margins, and DPO with ground-truth margins on the UltraFeedback
dataset. Additionally, we show that there is a tradeoff between discriminative
and generative performance: improving test classification accuracy,
particularly by correctly labeling weaker preferences at the expense of
stronger ones, can lead to a decline in generative quality. To navigate this
tradeoff, we propose two sampling strategies to gather
preference-over-preference labels: one favoring discriminative performance and
one favoring generative performance.

Motivation: 尽管在线学习排序算法在信息检索和推荐系统中广泛应用，但其对协同对抗攻击的脆弱性尚未得到充分理解，这构成了重要的安全威胁。

Method: 提出了两种新颖的攻击策略：针对CascadeUCB1的CascadeOFA和针对PBM-UCB的PBMOFA，这些策略通过精心设计的操纵来欺骗学习算法。

Result: 理论分析证明两种策略仅需O(log T)次操纵即可成功，实证结果在真实世界数据上验证了攻击的有效性。

Abstract: Online learning to rank (OLTR) plays a critical role in information retrieval
and machine learning systems, with a wide range of applications in search
engines and content recommenders. However, despite their extensive adoption,
the susceptibility of OLTR algorithms to coordinated adversarial attacks
remains poorly understood. In this work, we present a novel framework for
attacking some of the widely used OLTR algorithms. Our framework is designed to
promote a set of target items so that they appear in the list of top-K
recommendations for T - o(T) rounds, while simultaneously inducing linear
regret in the learning algorithm. We propose two novel attack strategies:
CascadeOFA for CascadeUCB1 and PBMOFA for PBM-UCB . We provide theoretical
guarantees showing that both strategies require only O(log T) manipulations to
succeed. Additionally, we supplement our theoretical analysis with empirical
results on real-world data.

TL;DR: 该论文通过神经正切核理论分析了图神经网络中邻域采样的系统行为，发现不同采样方法在有限样本下的后验分布不同，但随着样本增加会收敛到相同分布，且没有一种采样方法在所有情况下都占优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 邻域采样在大规模图神经网络训练中是重要技术，能抑制邻域大小的指数增长并控制内存和时间成本。虽然已成为标准实现，但其系统行为缺乏理论理解。

Method: 使用神经正切核工具进行分析，该工具通过无限宽网络对应的高斯过程来表征神经网络的训练动态，研究了几种已建立的邻域采样方法及其对应的后验高斯过程。

Result: 在有限样本下，不同采样方法的后验分布各不相同，但随着样本量增加会收敛到相同的分布。后验协方差（预测误差均方值的下界）不可比较，这与没有采样方法占主导地位的观察结果一致。

Conclusion: 邻域采样方法的理论分析表明，在有限样本情况下不同方法产生不同效果，但没有一种方法在所有场景下都最优，这解释了实践中观察到的现象。

Abstract: Neighborhood sampling is an important ingredient in the training of
large-scale graph neural networks. It suppresses the exponential growth of the
neighborhood size across network layers and maintains feasible memory
consumption and time costs. While it becomes a standard implementation in
practice, its systemic behaviors are less understood. We conduct a theoretical
analysis by using the tool of neural tangent kernels, which characterize the
(analogous) training dynamics of neural networks based on their infinitely wide
counterparts -- Gaussian processes (GPs). We study several established
neighborhood sampling approaches and the corresponding posterior GP. With
limited samples, the posteriors are all different, although they converge to
the same one as the sample size increases. Moreover, the posterior covariance,
which lower-bounds the mean squared prediction error, is uncomparable, aligning
with observations that no sampling approach dominates.

Abstract: In the context of industrial factories and energy producers, unplanned
outages are highly costly and difficult to service. However, existing
acoustic-anomaly detection studies largely rely on generic industrial or
synthetic datasets, with few focused on hydropower plants due to limited
access. This paper presents a comparative analysis of acoustic-based anomaly
detection methods, as a way to improve predictive maintenance in hydropower
plants. We address key challenges in the acoustic preprocessing under highly
noisy conditions before extracting time- and frequency-domain features. Then,
we benchmark three machine learning models: LSTM AE, K-Means, and OC-SVM, which
are tested on two real-world datasets from the Rodundwerk II pumped-storage
plant in Austria, one with induced anomalies and one with real-world
conditions. The One-Class SVM achieved the best trade-off of accuracy (ROC AUC
0.966-0.998) and minimal training time, while the LSTM autoencoder delivered
strong detection (ROC AUC 0.889-0.997) at the expense of higher computational
cost.

Method: 扩展Conformal Fairness框架到联邦学习设置，利用可交换性假设，通过分析不同人口群体的公平性差距来审计模型

Result: 在多个领域的数据集上进行了实证验证，充分验证了框架的有效性

Conclusion: 成功将公平性考虑整合到联邦学习环境中的不确定性量化框架，为联邦模型的公平性审计提供了有效方法

Abstract: Conformal Prediction (CP) is a widely used technique for quantifying
uncertainty in machine learning models. In its standard form, CP offers
probabilistic guarantees on the coverage of the true label, but it is agnostic
to sensitive attributes in the dataset. Several recent works have sought to
incorporate fairness into CP by ensuring conditional coverage guarantees across
different subgroups. One such method is Conformal Fairness (CF). In this work,
we extend the CF framework to the Federated Learning setting and discuss how we
can audit a federated model for fairness by analyzing the fairness-related gaps
for different demographic groups. We empirically validate our framework by
conducting experiments on several datasets spanning multiple domains, fully
leveraging the exchangeability assumption.

Abstract: Manifold alignment (MA) involves a set of techniques for learning shared
representations across domains, yet many traditional MA methods are incapable
of performing out-of-sample extension, limiting their real-world applicability.
We propose a guided representation learning framework leveraging a
geometry-regularized twin autoencoder (AE) architecture to enhance MA while
enabling generalization to unseen data. Our method enforces structured
cross-modal mappings to maintain geometric fidelity in learned embeddings. By
incorporating a pre-trained alignment model and a multitask learning
formulation, we improve cross-domain generalization and representation
robustness while maintaining alignment fidelity. We evaluate our approach using
several MA methods, showing improvements in embedding consistency, information
preservation, and cross-domain transfer. Additionally, we apply our framework
to Alzheimer's disease diagnosis, demonstrating its ability to integrate
multi-modal patient data and enhance predictive accuracy in cases limited to a
single domain by leveraging insights from the multi-modal problem.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 物联网设备产生大量多变量时间序列数据，需要在资源受限的边缘环境中进行高效准确处理。现有HD计算在分类任务中高效但难以捕捉复杂时间模式，而变换器擅长序列建模但计算和内存开销大。

Abstract: The proliferation of Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices has led to an
unprecedented volume of multivariate time series (MTS) data, requiring
efficient and accurate processing for timely decision-making in
resource-constrained edge environments. Hyperdimensional (HD) computing, with
its inherent efficiency and parallelizability, has shown promise in
classification tasks but struggles to capture complex temporal patterns, while
Transformers excel at sequence modeling but incur high computational and memory
overhead. We introduce BiHDTrans, an efficient neurosymbolic binary
hyperdimensional Transformer that integrates self-attention into the HD
computing paradigm, unifying the representational efficiency of HD computing
with the temporal modeling power of Transformers. Empirically, BiHDTrans
outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) HD computing models by at least 14.47% and
achieves 6.67% higher accuracy on average than SOTA binary Transformers. With
hardware acceleration on FPGA, our pipelined implementation leverages the
independent and identically distributed properties of high-dimensional
representations, delivering 39.4 times lower inference latency than SOTA binary
Transformers. Theoretical analysis shows that binarizing in holographic
high-dimensional space incurs significantly less information distortion than
directly binarizing neural networks, explaining BiHDTrans's superior accuracy.
Furthermore, dimensionality experiments confirm that BiHDTrans remains
competitive even with a 64% reduction in hyperspace dimensionality, surpassing
SOTA binary Transformers by 1-2% in accuracy with 4.4 times less model size, as
well as further reducing the latency by 49.8% compare to the full-dimensional
baseline. Together, these contributions bridge the gap between the
expressiveness of Transformers and the efficiency of HD computing, enabling
accurate, scalable, and low-latency MTS classification.

Abstract: We introduce a novel approach to large language model (LLM) distillation by
formulating it as a constrained reinforcement learning problem. While recent
work has begun exploring the integration of task-specific rewards into
distillation processes, existing methods typically rely on ad-hoc reward
weighting. We propose a principled optimization framework that maximizes
task-specific rewards while constraining the divergence from the teacher model
to remain below a specified threshold. Our approach adapts constrained state
augmented reinforcement learning to the distillation setting, introducing a
modified reward function that maintains theoretical guarantees of constraint
satisfaction without requiring state augmentation or teacher model access
during deployment and without the computational overhead of the dual Lagrangian
methods. Through extensive experiments on mathematical reasoning tasks, we
demonstrate that our method achieves better constraint satisfaction rates and
better reasoning compared to the soft Lagrangian relaxation baselines while
maintaining competitive task performance. Our framework provides a
theoretically grounded and practically efficient solution for reward-aware
distillation in resource-constrained settings.

TL;DR: MonoCon是一个通过功能性约束学习高质量表征的框架，使用单调MLP头结合对比损失和单调性约束，在保持性能的同时实现9倍压缩和1.5倍鲁棒性提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决AI中学习高质量、鲁棒、高效和可解耦表征的核心挑战，传统方法主要依赖架构和优化约束，本文引入功能性约束作为第三种途径。

Method: 在预训练编码器上附加小型单调多层感知机头，通过对比损失和单调性约束引导编码器与头的协同适应。

Result: 在CIFAR-100图像分类任务中，表征比微调编码器基线压缩近9倍、鲁棒性提升1.5倍，同时保持99%的5-NN分类准确率；在SNLI句子相似性任务中，表征压缩3.4倍、鲁棒性提升1.4倍。

Conclusion: 通过功能性约束学习的鲁棒超紧凑表征为从边缘计算到云规模检索等不同场景的关键挑战提供了统一解决方案。

Abstract: Learning high-quality, robust, efficient, and disentangled representations is
a central challenge in artificial intelligence (AI). Deep metric learning
frameworks tackle this challenge primarily using architectural and optimization
constraints. Here, we introduce a third approach that instead relies on
$\textit{functional}$ constraints. Specifically, we present MonoCon, a simple
framework that uses a small monotonic multi-layer perceptron (MLP) head
attached to any pre-trained encoder. Due to co-adaptation between encoder and
head guided by contrastive loss and monotonicity constraints, MonoCon learns
robust, disentangled, and highly compact embeddings at a practically negligible
performance cost. On the CIFAR-100 image classification task, MonoCon yields
representations that are nearly 9x more compact and 1.5x more robust than the
fine-tuned encoder baseline, while retaining 99\% of the baseline's 5-NN
classification accuracy. We also report a 3.4x more compact and 1.4x more
robust representation on an SNLI sentence similarity task for a marginal
reduction in the STSb score, establishing MonoCon as a general domain-agnostic
framework. Crucially, these robust, ultra-compact representations learned via
functional constraints offer a unified solution to critical challenges in
disparate contexts ranging from edge computing to cloud-scale retrieval.

### [41] [Compute-Optimal Quantization-Aware Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22935)
*Aleksandr Dremov,David Grangier,Angelos Katharopoulos,Awni Hannun*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文研究了量化感知训练(QAT)中FP阶段和QAT阶段计算资源分配的最优比例，发现QAT与FP训练的最优比例随总计算量增加而增加，并提出了基于tokens-per-parameter-byte统计的预测方法和损失缩放定律。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然先前研究表明将训练分解为全精度(FP)阶段和QAT阶段比单独使用QAT能获得更高精度，但两个阶段间最优计算分配仍不明确，需要系统研究。

Method: 进行了大规模实验，涵盖不同计算预算、QAT位宽(从86.0M到2.2B)和模型大小，分析不同QAT持续时间对最终性能的影响，并推导出损失缩放定律。

Result: 发现QAT与FP训练的最优比例随总计算量增加而增加，该比例可通过tokens-per-parameter-byte统计准确预测，提出的缩放定律能预测最优QAT比例和最终模型性能。

Conclusion: 研究结果为高效QAT规划提供了实用见解，能在相同计算预算下训练更高质量的量化模型，并提出了新的冷却和QAT融合方法以节省计算资源。

Abstract: Quantization-aware training (QAT) is a leading technique for improving the
accuracy of quantized neural networks. Previous work has shown that decomposing
training into a full-precision (FP) phase followed by a QAT phase yields
superior accuracy compared to QAT alone. However, the optimal allocation of
compute between the FP and QAT phases remains unclear. We conduct extensive
experiments with various compute budgets, QAT bit widths, and model sizes from
86.0M to 2.2B to investigate how different QAT durations impact final
performance. We demonstrate that, contrary to previous findings, the
loss-optimal ratio of QAT to FP training increases with the total amount of
compute. Moreover, the optimal fraction can be accurately predicted for a wide
range of model sizes and quantization widths using the
tokens-per-parameter-byte statistic. From experimental data, we derive a loss
scaling law that predicts both optimal QAT ratios and final model performance
across different QAT/FP compute allocation strategies and QAT bit widths. We
use the scaling law to make further predictions, which we verify
experimentally, including which QAT bit width is optimal under a given memory
constraint and how QAT accuracy with different bit widths compares to
full-precision model accuracy. Additionally, we propose a novel cooldown and
QAT fusion approach that performs learning rate decay jointly with
quantization-aware training, eliminating redundant full-precision model updates
and achieving significant compute savings. These findings provide practical
insights into efficient QAT planning and enable the training of higher-quality
quantized models with the same compute budget.

*Yanqing Lu,Letao Wang,Jinbo Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SOAP优化算法在语言建模任务中表现优于Adam和Shampoo，但理论分析显示SOAP与Shampoo在理想条件下等价，实验证实两者收敛速度和最终损失相似。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 从梯度白化角度分析Adam、Shampoo和SOAP优化算法，理解其预调节器作为白化矩阵的近似，并建立SOAP与Shampoo的理论等价性。

Method: 通过梯度白化理论框架分析三种优化算法，建立SOAP与Shampoo在Kronecker乘积假设下的理论等价性，并使用nanoGPT和灰度图像着色实验进行验证。

Result: 实验结果显示SOAP与Shampoo具有相似的收敛速度，在最终损失方面相比Adam和Shampoo没有显著优势，这与理论等价性一致。

Conclusion: SOAP虽然在训练效率上表现优异，但在理论上与Shampoo等价，实际性能差异不大，这为理解优化算法提供了新的理论视角。

Abstract: Shampoo with Adam in the Preconditioner's eigenbasis (SOAP) has recently
emerged as a promising optimization algorithm for neural network training,
achieving superior training efficiency over both Adam and Shampoo in language
modeling tasks. In this work, we analyze Adam, Shampoo, and SOAP from the
perspective of gradient whitening, interpreting their preconditioners as
approximations to the whitening matrix, which captures second-order curvature
information. We further establish a theoretical equivalence between idealized
versions of SOAP and Shampoo under the Kronecker product assumption. To
empirically evaluate these insights, we reproduce the language modeling
experiments using nanoGPT and grayscale image colorization. Our results show
that SOAP exhibits similar convergence rate as Shampoo, and no significant
advantage over both Adam and Shampoo in the final loss achieved, which aligns
with their equivalence in theory.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SINQ是一种后训练量化方法，通过引入第二轴尺度因子和快速Sinkhorn-Knopp算法来归一化行列方差，解决低比特量化中的精度问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前后训练量化方法在4比特及以下精度时会出现困惑度下降，主要原因是异常值表示导致共享相同尺度的参数出现精度问题，这在无校准的均匀量化方法中尤为明显。

Method: 在现有后训练量化器基础上增加第二轴尺度因子，使用快速Sinkhorn-Knopp算法寻找尺度来归一化每行和每列的方差，最小化矩阵不平衡这一新的量化代理目标。

Result: 在Qwen3模型家族和DeepSeek-V2.5上评估，SINQ显著改善了WikiText2和C4的困惑度表现，优于无校准均匀量化基线，并可进一步与校准和非均匀量化级别结合增强效果。

Conclusion: SINQ方法无需层间交互，可轻松应用于新架构以量化任何线性层，为解决低比特量化中的精度问题提供了有效方案。

Abstract: Post-training quantization has emerged as the most widely used strategy for
deploying large language models at low precision. Still, current methods show
perplexity degradation at bit-widths less than or equal to 4, partly because
representing outliers causes precision issues in parameters that share the same
scales as these outliers. This problem is especially pronounced for
calibration-free, uniform quantization methods. We introduce SINQ to augment
existing post-training quantizers with an additional second-axis scale factor
and a fast Sinkhorn-Knopp-style algorithm that finds scales to normalize
per-row and per-column variances, thereby minimizing a novel per-matrix proxy
target for quantization: the matrix imbalance. Our method has no interactions
between layers and can be trivially applied to new architectures to quantize
any linear layers. We evaluate our method on the Qwen3 model family and
DeepSeek-V2.5. SINQ improves WikiText2 and C4 perplexity significantly against
uncalibrated uniform quantization baselines and can be further enhanced by
combining it with calibration and non-uniform quantization levels. Code to
reproduce the results of this work and to easily quantize models using SINQ is
available at https://github.com/huawei-csl/SINQ.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 变分数据同化方法在海洋和大气预报中广泛应用，但涉及Hessian信息时计算成本高昂，需要解决这一计算挑战。

Method: 使用傅里叶神经算子（FNO）来近似逆Hessian算子，构建FNO-CG方法，为共轭梯度法提供初始化。

Result: 在线性平流方程上的数值实验显示，FNO-CG方法相比标准CG方法平均相对误差减少62%，迭代次数减少17%，在病态条件下改进最为明显。

Conclusion: FNO-CG方法对于具有挑战性的数据同化问题具有鲁棒性和高效性，特别是在病态情况下表现突出。

Abstract: Data assimilation (DA) is crucial for enhancing solutions to partial
differential equations (PDEs), such as those in numerical weather prediction,
by optimizing initial conditions using observational data. Variational DA
methods are widely used in oceanic and atmospheric forecasting, but become
computationally expensive, especially when Hessian information is involved. To
address this challenge, we propose a meta-learning framework that employs the
Fourier Neural Operator (FNO) to approximate the inverse Hessian operator
across a family of DA problems, thereby providing an effective initialization
for the conjugate gradient (CG) method. Numerical experiments on a linear
advection equation demonstrate that the resulting FNO-CG approach reduces the
average relative error by $62\%$ and the number of iterations by $17\%$
compared to the standard CG. These improvements are most pronounced in
ill-conditioned scenarios, highlighting the robustness and efficiency of FNO-CG
for challenging DA problems.

Motivation: 现有的深度生成模型缺乏通用的Neyman正交性及其相关的准预言机效率和双重稳健性等理论优势，需要开发具有这些理论保证的新方法。

Method: 开发了基于条件归一化流（GDR-CNFs）、条件生成对抗网络（GDR-CGANs）、条件变分自编码器（GDR-CVAEs）和条件扩散模型（GDR-CDMs）的GDR-learners框架。

Conclusion: GDR-learners具有准预言机效率和速率双重稳健性，因此是渐近最优的，为潜在结果分布估计提供了理论保证的灵活框架。

Abstract: Various deep generative models have been proposed to estimate potential
outcomes distributions from observational data. However, none of them have the
favorable theoretical property of general Neyman-orthogonality and, associated
with it, quasi-oracle efficiency and double robustness. In this paper, we
introduce a general suite of generative Neyman-orthogonal (doubly-robust)
learners that estimate the conditional distributions of potential outcomes. Our
proposed GDR-learners are flexible and can be instantiated with many
state-of-the-art deep generative models. In particular, we develop GDR-learners
based on (a) conditional normalizing flows (which we call GDR-CNFs), (b)
conditional generative adversarial networks (GDR-CGANs), (c) conditional
variational autoencoders (GDR-CVAEs), and (d) conditional diffusion models
(GDR-CDMs). Unlike the existing methods, our GDR-learners possess the
properties of quasi-oracle efficiency and rate double robustness, and are thus
asymptotically optimal. In a series of (semi-)synthetic experiments, we
demonstrate that our GDR-learners are very effective and outperform the
existing methods in estimating the conditional distributions of potential
outcomes.

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: As Generative AI (GenAI) systems see growing adoption, a key concern involves
the external validity of evaluations, or the extent to which they generalize
from lab-based to real-world deployment conditions. Threats to the external
validity of GenAI evaluations arise when the source sample of human raters and
system outputs used to obtain a system quality estimate differs from the target
distribution at deployment time. In this work, we propose a doubly-robust
estimation framework designed to address this evaluation sampling bias. Key to
our approach is the use of "persona" ratings produced by prompting an LLM
evaluator (i.e., an LLM-as-a-judge) to behave as a human rater with specific
sociodemographic characteristics. Our doubly-robust framework combines these
informative yet imperfect persona ratings with human ratings obtained under
evaluation sampling bias to produce statistically valid system quality
estimates. In particular, we show that our approach yields valid system quality
estimates when either (i) a model trained to predict human ratings using
persona ratings and source data observed under sampling bias, or (ii) a
reweighting model that corrects for sampling bias is of sufficient quality. We
validate our framework theoretically and via a novel Persona Simulation
Framework (PSF) designed to systematically manipulate persona quality and the
degree of evaluation sampling bias present in source data. Our work provides a
principled foundation for combining imperfect persona ratings with human
ratings observed under sampling bias to obtain valid system quality estimates.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) struggles to scale to large, combinatorial action
spaces common in many real-world problems. This paper introduces a novel
framework for training discrete diffusion models as highly effective policies
in these complex settings. Our key innovation is an efficient online training
process that ensures stable and effective policy improvement. By leveraging
policy mirror descent (PMD) to define an ideal, regularized target policy
distribution, we frame the policy update as a distributional matching problem,
training the expressive diffusion model to replicate this stable target. This
decoupled approach stabilizes learning and significantly enhances training
performance. Our method achieves state-of-the-art results and superior sample
efficiency across a diverse set of challenging combinatorial benchmarks,
including DNA sequence generation, RL with macro-actions, and multi-agent
systems. Experiments demonstrate that our diffusion policies attain superior
performance compared to other baselines.

Abstract: Off-policy reinforcement learning (RL) with function approximation offers an
effective way to improve sample efficiency by reusing past experience. Within
this setting, the actor-critic (AC) framework has achieved strong empirical
success. However, both the critic and actor learning is challenging for the
off-policy AC methods: first of all, in addition to the classic "deadly triad"
instability of off-policy evaluation, it also suffers from a "moving target"
problem, where the policy being evaluated changes continually; secondly, actor
learning becomes less efficient due to the difficulty of estimating the exact
off-policy policy gradient. The first challenge essentially reduces the problem
to repeatedly performing off-policy evaluation for changing policies. For the
second challenge, the off-policy policy gradient theorem requires a complex and
often impractical algorithm to estimate an additional emphasis critic, which is
typically neglected in practice, thereby reducing to the on-policy policy
gradient as an approximation. In this work, we introduce a novel concept of
functional critic modeling, which leads to a new AC framework that addresses
both challenges for actor-critic learning under the deadly triad setting. We
provide a theoretical analysis in the linear function setting, establishing the
provable convergence of our framework, which, to the best of our knowledge, is
the first convergent off-policy target-based AC algorithm. From a practical
perspective, we further propose a carefully designed neural network
architecture for the functional critic modeling and demonstrate its
effectiveness through preliminary experiments on widely used RL tasks from the
DeepMind Control Benchmark.

Abstract: We introduce FAEclust, a novel functional autoencoder framework for cluster
analysis of multi-dimensional functional data, data that are random
realizations of vector-valued random functions. Our framework features a
universal-approximator encoder that captures complex nonlinear
interdependencies among component functions, and a universal-approximator
decoder capable of accurately reconstructing both Euclidean and manifold-valued
functional data. Stability and robustness are enhanced through innovative
regularization strategies applied to functional weights and biases.
Additionally, we incorporate a clustering loss into the network's training
objective, promoting the learning of latent representations that are conducive
to effective clustering. A key innovation is our shape-informed clustering
objective, ensuring that the clustering results are resistant to phase
variations in the functions. We establish the universal approximation property
of our non-linear decoder and validate the effectiveness of our model through
extensive experiments.

Abstract: Mathematical programming -- the task of expressing operations and
decision-making problems in precise mathematical language -- is fundamental
across domains, yet remains a skill-intensive process requiring operations
research expertise. Recent advances in large language models for complex
reasoning have spurred interest in automating this task, translating natural
language into executable optimization models. Current approaches, however,
achieve limited accuracy, hindered by scarce and noisy training data without
leveraging domain knowledge. In this work, we systematically integrate
optimization expertise to improve formulation accuracy for mixed-integer linear
programming, a key family of mathematical programs. Our approach first cleans
training data through class-based error analysis to explicitly prevent common
mistakes within each optimization class. We then develop multi-turn inference
strategies that guide LLMs with class-specific error summaries and solver
feedback, enabling iterative refinement. Experiments across multiple base LLMs
demonstrate that combining cleaned data with domain-informed prompting and
feedback improves formulation accuracy by 14 percentage points on average,
enabling further progress toward robust LLM-assisted optimization formulation.

Abstract: As machine learning models continue to grow in size and complexity, efficient
serving faces increasingly broad trade-offs spanning accuracy, latency,
resource usage, and other objectives. Multi-model serving further complicates
these trade-offs; for example, in cascaded models, each early-exit decision
balances latency reduction against potential accuracy loss. Despite the
pervasiveness and importance of such trade-offs, current strategies remain
largely heuristic and case-specific, limiting both their theoretical guarantees
and general applicability.
  We present a general framework, T-Tamer, which formalizes this setting as a
multi-stage decision process, where the objective is to determine both when to
exit and which model to consult. Our main result shows that recall (i.e., the
ability to revisit earlier models) is both necessary and sufficient for
achieving provable performance guarantees. In particular, we prove that
strategies without recall cannot obtain any constant-factor approximation to
the optimal trade-off, whereas recall-based strategies provably attain the
optimal trade-off in polynomial time.
  We validate our analysis through experiments on synthetic datasets and
early-exit workloads for vision and NLP benchmarks. The results show that
recall-based strategies consistently yield efficient accuracy-latency
trade-offs. We hope this work provides a principled foundation for bridging
heuristic practice with theoretical guarantees in the design of early-exit and
cascaded models.

Motivation: 研究变分方法是否能改善稀疏自编码器的特征组织和可解释性，通过概率采样创建分散压力使特征在潜在空间中更连贯地组织。

Method: 提出变分稀疏自编码器(vSAE)，用从学习的高斯后验中随机采样替代确定性ReLU门控，并加入朝向标准正态先验的KL散度正则化。

Result: vSAE在核心评估指标上表现不如标准SAE，虽然在特征独立性和消融指标上表现优异，但KL散度项导致过度正则化，显著减少活跃特征比例，产生大量死特征。

Conclusion: 将变分方法简单应用于SAE并不能改善特征组织或可解释性，需要更精细的方法来平衡正则化压力。

Abstract: Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) have emerged as a promising approach for
interpreting neural network representations by learning sparse,
human-interpretable features from dense activations. We investigate whether
incorporating variational methods into SAE architectures can improve feature
organization and interpretability. We introduce the variational Sparse
Autoencoder (vSAE), which replaces deterministic ReLU gating with stochastic
sampling from learned Gaussian posteriors and incorporates KL divergence
regularization toward a standard normal prior. Our hypothesis is that this
probabilistic sampling creates dispersive pressure, causing features to
organize more coherently in the latent space while avoiding overlap. We
evaluate a Topk vSAE against a standard TopK SAE on Pythia-70M transformer
residual steam activations using comprehensive benchmarks including SAE Bench,
individual feature interpretability analysis, and global latent space
visualization through t-SNE. The vSAE underperforms standard SAE across core
evaluation metrics, though excels at feature independence and ablation metrics.
The KL divergence term creates excessive regularization pressure that
substantially reduces the fraction of living features, leading to observed
performance degradation. While vSAE features demonstrate improved robustness,
they exhibit many more dead features than baseline. Our findings suggest that
naive application of variational methods to SAEs does not improve feature
organization or interpretability.

Conclusion: 这项工作为构建更智能、资源效率更高的联邦系统开辟了新方向，将异质性作为特征而非缺陷加以利用。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) is increasingly adopted in domains like healthcare,
where data privacy is paramount. A fundamental challenge in these systems is
statistical heterogeneity-the fact that data distributions vary significantly
across clients (e.g., different hospitals may treat distinct patient
demographics). While current FL algorithms focus on aggregating model updates
from these heterogeneous clients, the potential of the central server remains
under-explored. This paper is motivated by a healthcare scenario: could a
central server not only build a model but also guide a new patient to the
hospital best equipped for their specific condition? We generalize this idea to
propose a novel paradigm for FL systems where the server actively guides the
allocation of new tasks or queries to the most appropriate client in the
network. To enable this, we introduce an empirical likelihood-based framework
that simultaneously addresses two goals: (1) learning effective local models on
each client, and (2) finding the best matching client for a new query.
Empirical results demonstrate the framework's effectiveness on benchmark
datasets, showing improvements in both model accuracy and the precision of
client guidance compared to standard FL approaches. This work opens a new
direction for building more intelligent and resource-efficient federated
systems that leverage heterogeneity as a feature, not just a bug. Code is

### [55] [Sample-efficient Multiclass Calibration under $\ell_{p}$ Error](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23000)
*Konstantina Bairaktari,Huy L. Nguyen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的校准误差定义，在两种现有校准误差概念之间插值，实现了多项式样本复杂度的校准算法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多类预测器的校准具有挑战性，因为可能的预测值呈指数级增长。现有校准误差概念要么需要指数级样本，要么需要多项式样本，但各有局限性。

Method: 使用自适应数据分析的新应用，具有高自适应性但样本复杂度仅对数开销。算法可以校准任何给定预测器，覆盖整个插值范围（除一个端点外）。

Result: 在除一个端点外的整个插值范围内，仅使用多项式数量的样本即可校准预测器。在另一个端点处，对误差参数的依赖接近最优，改进了先前工作。

Conclusion: 提出的新校准误差定义和算法在多类预测器校准方面取得了重要进展，平衡了样本复杂度和校准精度。

Abstract: Calibrating a multiclass predictor, that outputs a distribution over labels,
is particularly challenging due to the exponential number of possible
prediction values. In this work, we propose a new definition of calibration
error that interpolates between two established calibration error notions, one
with known exponential sample complexity and one with polynomial sample
complexity for calibrating a given predictor. Our algorithm can calibrate any
given predictor for the entire range of interpolation, except for one endpoint,
using only a polynomial number of samples. At the other endpoint, we achieve
nearly optimal dependence on the error parameter, improving upon previous work.
A key technical contribution is a novel application of adaptive data analysis
with high adaptivity but only logarithmic overhead in the sample complexity.

Abstract: Blockchain Business applications and cryptocurrencies such as enable secure,
decentralized value transfer, yet their pseudonymous nature creates
opportunities for illicit activity, challenging regulators and exchanges in
anti money laundering (AML) enforcement. Detecting fraudulent transactions in
blockchain networks requires models that can capture both structural and
temporal dependencies while remaining resilient to noise, imbalance, and
adversarial behavior. In this work, we propose an ensemble framework that
integrates Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN), Graph Attention Networks (GAT),
and Graph Isomorphism Networks (GIN) to enhance blockchain fraud detection.
Using the real-world Elliptic dataset, our tuned soft voting ensemble achieves
high recall of illicit transactions while maintaining a false positive rate
below 1%, beating individual GNN models and baseline methods. The modular
architecture incorporates quantum-ready design hooks, allowing seamless future
integration of quantum feature mappings and hybrid quantum classical graph
neural networks. This ensures scalability, robustness, and long-term
adaptability as quantum computing technologies mature. Our findings highlight
ensemble GNNs as a practical and forward-looking solution for real-time
cryptocurrency monitoring, providing both immediate AML utility and a pathway
toward quantum-enhanced financial security analytics.

Abstract: From metronomes to celestial bodies, mechanics underpins how the world
evolves in time and space. With consideration of this, a number of recent
neural network models leverage inductive biases from classical mechanics to
encourage model interpretability and ensure forecasted states are physical.
However, in general, these models are designed to capture the dynamics of a
single system with fixed physical parameters, from state-space measurements of
a known configuration space. In this paper we introduce Symplectic Phase Space
GAN (SPS-GAN) which can capture the dynamics of multiple systems, and
generalize to unseen physical parameters from. Moreover, SPS-GAN does not
require prior knowledge of the system configuration space. In fact, SPS-GAN can
discover the configuration space structure of the system from arbitrary
measurement types (e.g., state-space measurements, video frames). To achieve
physically plausible generation, we introduce a novel architecture which embeds
a Hamiltonian neural network recurrent module in a conditional GAN backbone. To
discover the structure of the configuration space, we optimize the conditional
time-series GAN objective with an additional physically motivated term to
encourages a sparse representation of the configuration space. We demonstrate
the utility of SPS-GAN for trajectory prediction, video generation and symmetry
discovery. Our approach captures multiple systems and achieves performance on
par with supervised models designed for single systems.

TL;DR: 提出了一个基于智能代理的联邦学习框架FedAgent，用于自动化医疗联邦学习的工作流程，包括客户端选择、协调、数据预处理、数据标准化和算法选择等复杂操作挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界中联邦学习的部署受到复杂操作挑战的阻碍，需要大量人工干预，包括客户端选择、协调、数据预处理、数据标准化和算法选择等。这些操作瓶颈促使需要自主、代理驱动的联邦学习系统。

Method: 引入了一个代理驱动的联邦学习框架，捕捉从客户端选择到训练完成的真实世界联邦学习工作流程的关键阶段，以及一个名为FedAgentBench的基准测试，评估LLM代理自主协调医疗联邦学习的能力。该框架包含40种联邦学习算法，针对不同的任务特定需求和跨客户端特征进行定制。

Result: 评估了14个开源和10个专有LLM的代理性能，涵盖小、中、大模型规模。结果显示，虽然一些代理核心如GPT-4.1和DeepSeek V3可以自动化联邦学习管道的各个阶段，但基于隐含目标的更复杂、相互依赖的任务对即使是最强的模型也具有挑战性。

Conclusion: 代理驱动的联邦学习框架可以显著减少医疗联邦学习部署中的人工干预，但复杂、相互依赖的任务仍然是当前LLM代理面临的挑战。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) allows collaborative model training across healthcare
sites without sharing sensitive patient data. However, real-world FL deployment
is often hindered by complex operational challenges that demand substantial
human efforts. This includes: (a) selecting appropriate clients (hospitals),
(b) coordinating between the central server and clients, (c) client-level data
pre-processing, (d) harmonizing non-standardized data and labels across
clients, and (e) selecting FL algorithms based on user instructions and
cross-client data characteristics. However, the existing FL works overlook
these practical orchestration challenges. These operational bottlenecks
motivate the need for autonomous, agent-driven FL systems, where intelligent
agents at each hospital client and the central server agent collaboratively
manage FL setup and model training with minimal human intervention. To this
end, we first introduce an agent-driven FL framework that captures key phases
of real-world FL workflows from client selection to training completion and a
benchmark dubbed FedAgentBench that evaluates the ability of LLM agents to
autonomously coordinate healthcare FL. Our framework incorporates 40 FL
algorithms, each tailored to address diverse task-specific requirements and
cross-client characteristics. Furthermore, we introduce a diverse set of
complex tasks across 201 carefully curated datasets, simulating 6
modality-specific real-world healthcare environments, viz., Dermatoscopy,
Ultrasound, Fundus, Histopathology, MRI, and X-Ray. We assess the agentic
performance of 14 open-source and 10 proprietary LLMs spanning small, medium,
and large model scales. While some agent cores such as GPT-4.1 and DeepSeek V3
can automate various stages of the FL pipeline, our results reveal that more
complex, interdependent tasks based on implicit goals remain challenging for
even the strongest models.

TL;DR: MoE-PHDS方法通过轻量级SFT训练，将单个MoE模型转换为可调节稀疏度的控制表面，实现在推理时动态调整k值而无需切换模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统MoE模型需要为不同稀疏度训练和维护多个模型，增加了部署复杂性和成本，限制了满足多样化延迟和效率需求的灵活性。

Method: 提出MoE-PHDS方法，通过跨稀疏度混合训练和在高稀疏度下的短课程学习，无需架构修改即可将单个检查点转换为全局稀疏度控制表面。

Result: 在多个模型上的实验表明，PHDS匹配或超过专用oracle模型，跨稀疏度一致性提升达22%，实现了简化的运行时MoE部署。

Conclusion: MoE-PHDS使全局稀疏度成为一级服务原语，实现了单一模型的可预测精度/延迟权衡，简化了MoE的灵活部署。

Abstract: Sparse Mixtures of Experts (MoEs) are typically trained to operate at a fixed
sparsity level, e.g. $k$ in a top-$k$ gating function. This global sparsity
level determines an operating point on the accuracy/latency curve; currently,
meeting multiple efficiency targets means training and maintaining multiple
models. This practice complicates serving, increases training and maintenance
costs, and limits flexibility in meeting diverse latency, efficiency, and
energy requirements. We show that pretrained MoEs are more robust to runtime
sparsity shifts than commonly assumed, and introduce MoE-PHDS ({\bf P}ost {\bf
H}oc {\bf D}eclared {\bf S}parsity), a lightweight SFT method that turns a
single checkpoint into a global sparsity control surface. PHDS mixes training
across sparsity levels and anchors with a short curriculum at high sparsity,
requiring no architectural changes. The result is predictable accuracy/latency
tradeoffs from one model: practitioners can ``dial $k$'' at inference time
without swapping checkpoints, changing architecture, or relying on token-level
heuristics. Experiments on OLMoE-1B-7B-0125, Qwen1.5-MoE-A2.7B, and proprietary
models fit on multiple operating points show that PHDS matches or exceeds
well-specified oracle models, improves cross-sparsity agreement by up to 22\%
vs. well-specified oracle models, and enables simplified, flexible runtime MoE
deployment by making global sparsity a first-class serving primitive.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 分布式强化学习在异构异步计算和通信瓶颈下的理论研究相对不足，现有方法在效率和理论保证方面存在局限。

Method: 设计了两种新算法：Rennala NIGT支持AllReduce操作，在均匀设置下优化计算和通信复杂度；Malenia NIGT专门处理异步计算和异构环境。

Result: 在均匀设置下，Rennala NIGT显著改善了总计算和通信复杂度；在异构设置下，Malenia NIGT具有更优的理论保证，实验表明两种方法都显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 提出的两种算法在分布式强化学习的异步和异构环境中都取得了突破，为处理复杂的分布式学习场景提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: We study distributed reinforcement learning (RL) with policy gradient methods
under asynchronous and parallel computations and communications. While
non-distributed methods are well understood theoretically and have achieved
remarkable empirical success, their distributed counterparts remain less
explored, particularly in the presence of heterogeneous asynchronous
computations and communication bottlenecks. We introduce two new algorithms,
Rennala NIGT and Malenia NIGT, which implement asynchronous policy gradient
aggregation and achieve state-of-the-art efficiency. In the homogeneous
setting, Rennala NIGT provably improves the total computational and
communication complexity while supporting the AllReduce operation. In the
heterogeneous setting, Malenia NIGT simultaneously handles asynchronous
computations and heterogeneous environments with strictly better theoretical
guarantees. Our results are further corroborated by experiments, showing that
our methods significantly outperform prior approaches.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的高阶消息传递方法基于霍奇拉普拉斯算子，但其在高维情况下的归纳偏置不够明确甚至可能退化。需要更富表达力的消息传递框架来改进局部和全局描述符之间的接口。

Method: 采用层理论作为形式化框架，使用层拉普拉斯算子替代霍奇拉普拉斯算子进行非线性扩散。层拉普拉斯算子将k维数据特征与k维层上同调相关联，这是奇异上同调的数据感知泛化。

Result: 论文扩展了图学习中层扩散的现有理论，并开发了适用于高阶设置的新理论和实践方法。

Conclusion: 层理论为拓扑深度学习提供了自然且原则性的形式化方法，能够创建更富表达力的消息传递机制，特别是在高阶设置中优于传统的霍奇拉普拉斯方法。

Abstract: Recent work in Topological Deep Learning (TDL) seeks to generalize graph
learning's preeminent $message \ passing$ paradigm to more complex relational
structures: simplicial complexes, cell complexes, hypergraphs, and combinations
thereof. Many approaches to such ${higher\text{-}order \ message \ passing}$
(HOMP) admit formulation in terms of nonlinear diffusion with the Hodge
(combinatorial) Laplacian, a graded operator which carries an inductive bias
that dimension-$k$ data features correlate with dimension-$k$ topological
features encoded in the (singular) cohomology of the underlying domain. For
$k=0$ this recovers the graph Laplacian and its well-studied homophily bias. In
higher gradings, however, the Hodge Laplacian's bias is more opaque and
potentially even degenerate. In this essay, we position sheaf theory as a
natural and principled formalism for modifying the Hodge Laplacian's
diffusion-mediated interface between local and global descriptors toward more
expressive message passing. The sheaf Laplacian's inductive bias correlates
dimension-$k$ data features with dimension-$k$ $sheaf$ cohomology, a data-aware
generalization of singular cohomology. We will contextualize and novelly extend
prior theory on sheaf diffusion in graph learning ($k=0$) in such a light --
and explore how it fails to generalize to $k>0$ -- before developing novel
theory and practice for the higher-order setting. Our exposition is accompanied
by a self-contained introduction shepherding sheaves from the abstract to the
applied.

TL;DR: 该论文通过谱分析方法研究大语言模型在预训练和后训练过程中表示几何的变化，发现了三个一致的几何阶段：初始的表示坍缩、熵寻求阶段和压缩寻求阶段，这些阶段与模型性能提升密切相关。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准训练指标如损失无法解释大语言模型中复杂能力的涌现，因此需要从表示几何的角度来理解模型训练过程中的动态变化。

Method: 使用谱分析方法，测量有效秩和特征谱衰减，分析OLMo和Pythia模型在预训练和后训练过程中的表示几何变化。

Result: 发现预训练过程中存在三个一致的几何阶段：初始表示坍缩、熵寻求阶段（维度扩张）和压缩寻求阶段（各向异性压缩），这些阶段与下游任务性能提升相关。后训练进一步改变几何：SFT和DPO驱动熵寻求动态，RLVR诱导压缩寻求。

Conclusion: 模型训练过程中的几何变化揭示了表示学习的基本机制，这些几何阶段源于交叉熵优化与表示瓶颈的相互作用，为理解模型能力涌现提供了新视角。

Abstract: Standard training metrics like loss fail to explain the emergence of complex
capabilities in large language models. We take a spectral approach to
investigate the geometry of learned representations across pretraining and
post-training, measuring effective rank (RankMe) and eigenspectrum decay
($\alpha$-ReQ). With OLMo (1B-7B) and Pythia (160M-12B) models, we uncover a
consistent non-monotonic sequence of three geometric phases during
autoregressive pretraining. The initial "warmup" phase exhibits rapid
representational collapse. This is followed by an "entropy-seeking" phase,
where the manifold's dimensionality expands substantially, coinciding with peak
n-gram memorization. Subsequently, a "compression-seeking" phase imposes
anisotropic consolidation, selectively preserving variance along dominant
eigendirections while contracting others, a transition marked with significant
improvement in downstream task performance. We show these phases can emerge
from a fundamental interplay of cross-entropy optimization under skewed token
frequencies and representational bottlenecks ($d \ll |V|$). Post-training
further transforms geometry: SFT and DPO drive "entropy-seeking" dynamics to
integrate specific instructional or preferential data, improving
in-distribution performance while degrading out-of-distribution robustness.
Conversely, RLVR induces "compression-seeking", enhancing reward alignment but
reducing generation diversity.

Conclusion: 该方法在合成和基准数据集上都提供了理论保证和实际性能改进，为缓解灾难性干扰问题提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Catastrophic interference, also known as catastrophic forgetting, is a
fundamental challenge in machine learning, where a trained learning model
progressively loses performance on previously learned tasks when adapting to
new ones. In this paper, we aim to better understand and model the catastrophic
interference problem from a latent representation learning point of view, and
propose a novel theoretical framework that formulates catastrophic interference
as an identification problem. Our analysis demonstrates that the forgetting
phenomenon can be quantified by the distance between partial-task aware (PTA)
and all-task aware (ATA) setups. Building upon recent advances in
identifiability theory, we prove that this distance can be minimized through
identification of shared latent variables between these setups. When learning,
we propose our method \ourmeos with two-stage training strategy: First, we
employ maximum likelihood estimation to learn the latent representations from
both PTA and ATA configurations. Subsequently, we optimize the KL divergence to
identify and learn the shared latent variables. Through theoretical guarantee
and empirical validations, we establish that identifying and learning these
shared representations can effectively mitigate catastrophic interference in
machine learning systems. Our approach provides both theoretical guarantees and
practical performance improvements across both synthetic and benchmark
datasets.

Abstract: The Sixth-Generation (6G) network envisions pervasive artificial intelligence
(AI) as a core goal, enabled by edge intelligence through on-device data
utilization. To realize this vision, federated learning (FL) has emerged as a
key paradigm for collaborative training across edge devices. However, the
sensitivity and heterogeneity of edge data pose key challenges to FL: parameter
sharing risks data reconstruction, and a unified global model struggles to
adapt to diverse local distributions. In this paper, we propose a novel
federated learning framework that integrates personalized differential privacy
(DP) and adaptive model design. To protect training data, we leverage
sample-level representations for knowledge sharing and apply a personalized DP
strategy to resist reconstruction attacks. To ensure distribution-aware
adaptation under privacy constraints, we develop a privacy-aware neural
architecture search (NAS) algorithm that generates locally customized
architectures and hyperparameters. To the best of our knowledge, this is the
first personalized DP solution tailored for representation-based FL with
theoretical convergence guarantees. Our scheme achieves strong privacy
guarantees for training data while significantly outperforming state-of-the-art
methods in model performance. Experiments on benchmark datasets such as
CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 demonstrate that our scheme improves accuracy by 6.82\%
over the federated NAS method PerFedRLNAS, while reducing model size to 1/10
and communication cost to 1/20.

TL;DR: GuardNet是一个分层过滤框架，通过构建结构化图结合图神经网络来检测和过滤越狱提示，显著提升了防御效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型容易受到越狱攻击，这些对抗性提示会绕过对齐约束，引发未经授权或有害行为，威胁LLM在医疗、金融等关键领域的安全性和可靠性。

Method: 构建结构化图结合序列链接、句法依赖和注意力派生的token关系，使用图神经网络进行两级过滤：提示级过滤检测全局对抗提示，token级过滤精确定位细粒度对抗片段。

Result: 在三个数据集和多种攻击设置下，GuardNet显著优于现有防御方法：在LLM-Fuzzer上将提示级F1分数从66.4%提升到99.8%，在PLeak数据集上从67-79%提升到94%以上；token级F1从48-75%提升到74-91%，IoU增益高达+28%。

Conclusion: GuardNet虽然结构复杂，但保持了可接受的延迟，在跨域评估中泛化良好，是实际LLM部署中对抗越狱威胁的实用且鲁棒的防御方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly susceptible to jailbreak
attacks, which are adversarial prompts that bypass alignment constraints and
induce unauthorized or harmful behaviors. These vulnerabilities undermine the
safety, reliability, and trustworthiness of LLM outputs, posing critical risks
in domains such as healthcare, finance, and legal compliance. In this paper, we
propose GuardNet, a hierarchical filtering framework that detects and filters
jailbreak prompts prior to inference. GuardNet constructs structured graphs
that combine sequential links, syntactic dependencies, and attention-derived
token relations to capture both linguistic structure and contextual patterns
indicative of jailbreak behavior. It then applies graph neural networks at two
levels: (i) a prompt-level filter that detects global adversarial prompts, and
(ii) a token-level filter that pinpoints fine-grained adversarial spans.
Extensive experiments across three datasets and multiple attack settings show
that GuardNet substantially outperforms prior defenses. It raises prompt-level
F$_1$ scores from 66.4\% to 99.8\% on LLM-Fuzzer, and from 67-79\% to over 94\%
on PLeak datasets. At the token level, GuardNet improves F$_1$ from 48-75\% to
74-91\%, with IoU gains up to +28\%. Despite its structural complexity,
GuardNet maintains acceptable latency and generalizes well in cross-domain
evaluations, making it a practical and robust defense against jailbreak threats
in real-world LLM deployments.

TL;DR: IsingFormer是一种基于Transformer的神经网络，通过生成全局自旋配置来加速马尔可夫链蒙特卡洛方法，在Ising模型采样和自旋玻璃优化中显著提升效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统MCMC方法在临界点和粗糙能量景观中混合缓慢，即使使用并行回火技术，每个副本仍依赖缓慢的局部更新来改变配置。

Method: 训练Transformer在平衡样本上生成完整的自旋配置，作为Metropolis步骤中的全局移动提议，与传统的单自旋翻转互补。

Result: 在2D Ising模型采样中，IsingFormer重现了磁化和自由能曲线，并泛化到未见温度；在3D自旋玻璃优化中，找到更低能量状态；在整数分解问题中，成功泛化到未见半素数。

Conclusion: IsingFormer证明蒙特卡洛方法可以通过捕捉全局结构的神经提议系统性地加速，实现更快的采样和更强的组合优化性能。

Abstract: Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) underlies both statistical physics and
combinatorial optimization, but mixes slowly near critical points and in rough
landscapes. Parallel Tempering (PT) improves mixing by swapping replicas across
temperatures, yet each replica still relies on slow local updates to change its
configuration. We introduce IsingFormer, a Transformer trained on equilibrium
samples that can generate entire spin configurations resembling those from the
target distribution. These uncorrelated samples are used as proposals for
global moves within a Metropolis step in PT, complementing the usual
single-spin flips. On 2D Ising models (sampling), IsingFormer reproduces
magnetization and free-energy curves and generalizes to unseen temperatures,
including the critical region. Injecting even a single proposal sharply reduces
equilibration time, replacing thousands of local updates. On 3D spin glasses
(optimization), PT enhanced with IsingFormer finds substantially lower-energy
states, demonstrating how global moves accelerate search in rugged landscapes.
Finally, applied to integer factorization encoded as Ising problems,
IsingFormer trained on a limited set of semiprimes transfers successfully to
unseen semiprimes, boosting success rates beyond the training distribution.
Since factorization is a canonical hard benchmark, this ability to generalize
across instances highlights the potential of learning proposals that move
beyond single problems to entire families of instances. The IsingFormer
demonstrates that Monte Carlo methods can be systematically accelerated by
neural proposals that capture global structure, yielding faster sampling and
stronger performance in combinatorial optimization.

Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型往往依赖语言先验而忽视视觉证据，现有分析方法无法揭示视觉信息影响模型行为的内部机制。

Method: 通过嵌入链分析层间表示动态，识别视觉整合点，并开发总视觉整合估计器来量化视觉查询对响应生成的影响。

Result: 在54个模型-数据集组合中，视觉整合点普遍存在，总视觉整合估计器能可靠预测语言先验的强度。

Conclusion: 该研究为诊断和理解大型视觉语言模型中的语言先验提供了原则性工具包。

Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) achieve strong performance on multimodal
tasks, yet they often default to their language prior (LP) -- memorized textual
patterns from pre-training while under-utilizing visual evidence. Prior
analyses of LP mostly rely on input-output probing, which fails to reveal the
internal mechanisms governing when and how vision influences model behavior. To
address this gap, we present the first systematic analysis of language prior
through the lens of chain-of-embedding, which examines the layer-wise
representation dynamics within LVLMs. Our analysis reveals a universal
phenomenon: each model exhibits a Visual Integration Point (VIP), a critical
layer at which visual information begins to meaningfully reshape hidden
representations and influence decoding. Building on this observation, we
introduce the Total Visual Integration (TVI) estimator, which aggregates
representation distance beyond the VIP to quantify how strongly visual query
influences response generation. Across 54 model-dataset combinations spanning 9
contemporary LVLMs and 6 benchmarks, we demonstrate that VIP consistently
emerges, and that TVI reliably predicts the strength of language prior. This
offers a principled toolkit for diagnosing and understanding language prior in
LVLMs.

### [68] [Dynamics of Learning: Generative Schedules from Latent ODEs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23052)
*Matt L. Sampson,Peter Melchior*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于动态系统建模的学习率调度器，通过超参数搜索的训练运行来学习训练过程的潜在表示，预测具有最佳长期验证性能的未来学习率计划。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有学习率调度器要么遵循简单的参数函数，要么仅对短期训练信号做出反应，缺乏对神经网络实际训练过程的全面时间视角。

Method: 将神经网络训练性能建模为动态系统，利用超参数搜索的训练运行学习训练过程的潜在表示，根据当前训练指标预测最佳长期验证性能的学习率计划。

Result: 在CNN、ResNet图像分类和Transformer下一词预测任务中达到SOTA结果，训练模型位于损失景观的更平坦区域，提供更好的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 该方法计算高效、优化器无关，可轻松集成到ML实验跟踪平台上，提供优于传统参数化函数的专门化学习率计划。

Abstract: The learning rate schedule is one of the most impactful aspects of neural
network optimization, yet most schedules either follow simple parametric
functions or react only to short-term training signals. None of them are
supported by a comprehensive temporal view of how well neural networks actually
train. We present a new learning rate scheduler that models the training
performance of neural networks as a dynamical system. It leverages training
runs from a hyperparameter search to learn a latent representation of the
training process. Given current training metrics, it predicts the future
learning rate schedule with the best long-term validation performance. Our
scheduler generalizes beyond previously observed training dynamics and creates
specialized schedules that deviate noticeably from common parametric functions.
It achieves SOTA results for image classification with CNN and ResNet models as
well as for next-token prediction with a transformer model. The trained models
are located in flatter regions of the loss landscape and thus provide better
generalization than those trained with other schedules. Our method is
computationally efficient, optimizer-agnostic, and can easily be layered on top
of ML experiment-tracking platforms. An implementation of our scheduler will be
made available after acceptance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有评估指标将模型性能与数据内在不可预测性混为一谈的根本缺陷，推动从简单聚合评分转向更深入的可预测性感知评估。

Method: 引入频谱相干性可预测性(SCP)评分来量化预测任务的固有难度，以及线性利用率比(LUR)来诊断模型利用线性可预测信息的效率。

Result: 首次系统证明了"可预测性漂移"现象，即任务的预测难度随时间剧烈变化；揭示了复杂模型在低可预测性数据上表现更优，而线性模型在更可预测任务中高效的架构权衡。

Conclusion: 倡导评估范式的转变，从简单聚合评分转向更具洞察力的可预测性感知评估，促进更公平的模型比较和更深入的行为理解。

Abstract: In the era of increasingly complex AI models for time series forecasting,
progress is often measured by marginal improvements on benchmark leaderboards.
However, this approach suffers from a fundamental flaw: standard evaluation
metrics conflate a model's performance with the data's intrinsic
unpredictability. To address this pressing challenge, we introduce a novel,
predictability-aligned diagnostic framework grounded in spectral coherence. Our
framework makes two primary contributions: the Spectral Coherence
Predictability (SCP), a computationally efficient ($O(N\log N)$) and
task-aligned score that quantifies the inherent difficulty of a given
forecasting instance, and the Linear Utilization Ratio (LUR), a
frequency-resolved diagnostic tool that precisely measures how effectively a
model exploits the linearly predictable information within the data. We
validate our framework's effectiveness and leverage it to reveal two core
insights. First, we provide the first systematic evidence of "predictability
drift", demonstrating that a task's forecasting difficulty varies sharply over
time. Second, our evaluation reveals a key architectural trade-off: complex
models are superior for low-predictability data, whereas linear models are
highly effective on more predictable tasks. We advocate for a paradigm shift,
moving beyond simplistic aggregate scores toward a more insightful,
predictability-aware evaluation that fosters fairer model comparisons and a
deeper understanding of model behavior.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CLAD-Net是一个用于可穿戴传感器持续学习的框架，通过结合自监督Transformer和知识蒸馏CNN，解决了数据分布偏移和灾难性遗忘问题，在PAMAP2数据集上实现了91.36%的最终准确率和仅8.78%的遗忘率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决可穿戴传感器数据中存在的非平稳分布问题，特别是在连续学习场景下，当模型学习新用户数据时出现的灾难性遗忘问题，以及人类研究中标记数据稀缺和不一致的问题。

Method: CLAD-Net整合了自监督Transformer（作为长期记忆）和监督CNN（通过知识蒸馏进行活动分类）。Transformer通过跨身体传感器的交叉注意力捕获全局活动模式，学习无需标签的可泛化表示；CNN利用知识蒸馏在逐用户微调时保留先前知识。

Result: 在PAMAP2数据集上，CLAD-Net达到91.36%的最终准确率，仅有8.78%的遗忘率，优于基于记忆和正则化的基线方法。在仅有10-20%标记数据的半监督设置下，仍能保持强劲性能。消融研究验证了各模块的贡献。

Conclusion: CLAD-Net有效地解决了可穿戴传感器持续学习中的灾难性遗忘和数据分布偏移问题，在标记数据稀缺的情况下仍能保持良好性能，为实际部署提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: The rise of deep learning has greatly advanced human behavior monitoring
using wearable sensors, particularly human activity recognition (HAR). While
deep models have been widely studied, most assume stationary data distributions
- an assumption often violated in real-world scenarios. For example, sensor
data from one subject may differ significantly from another, leading to
distribution shifts. In continual learning, this shift is framed as a sequence
of tasks, each corresponding to a new subject. Such settings suffer from
catastrophic forgetting, where prior knowledge deteriorates as new tasks are
learned. This challenge is compounded by the scarcity and inconsistency of
labeled data in human studies. To address these issues, we propose CLAD-Net
(Continual Learning with Attention and Distillation), a framework enabling
wearable-sensor models to be updated continuously without sacrificing
performance on past tasks. CLAD-Net integrates a self-supervised transformer,
acting as long-term memory, with a supervised Convolutional Neural Network
(CNN) trained via knowledge distillation for activity classification. The
transformer captures global activity patterns through cross-attention across
body-mounted sensors, learning generalizable representations without labels.
Meanwhile, the CNN leverages knowledge distillation to retain prior knowledge
during subject-wise fine-tuning. On PAMAP2, CLAD-Net achieves 91.36 percent
final accuracy with only 8.78 percent forgetting, surpassing memory-based and
regularization-based baselines such as Experience Replay and Elastic Weight
Consolidation. In semi-supervised settings with only 10-20 percent labeled
data, CLAD-Net still delivers strong performance, demonstrating robustness to
label scarcity. Ablation studies further validate each module's contribution.

*Hyunwoo Lee,Hayoung Choi,Hyunju Kim*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种针对奇Sigmoid激活函数类的初始化方法，通过选择适当的噪声尺度来避免激活值崩溃或饱和，使网络无需归一化层也能可靠训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 激活函数和权重初始化相互依赖，不合适的初始化会导致饱和、方差崩溃和学习率敏感性问题。

Method: 定义奇Sigmoid函数类，并为该类中的任何激活函数f提出专门的初始化方法，通过闭式解选择噪声尺度来保持前向激活的良好分散性。

Result: 该方法无需归一化层即可可靠训练，表现出强大的数据效率，并能支持标准初始化方法（Xavier、He、Orthogonal）通常无法可靠收敛的激活函数。

Conclusion: 提出的初始化方法解决了激活函数和权重初始化的相互依赖问题，能够有效避免饱和和方差崩溃，提升训练可靠性和数据效率。

Abstract: Activation functions critically influence trainability and expressivity, and
recent work has therefore explored a broad range of nonlinearities. However,
activations and weight initialization are interdependent: without an
appropriate initialization method, nonlinearities can cause saturation,
variance collapse, and increased learning rate sensitivity. We address this by
defining an odd sigmoid function class and, given any activation f in this
class, proposing an initialization method tailored to f. The method selects a
noise scale in closed form so that forward activations remain well dispersed up
to a target layer, thereby avoiding collapse to zero or saturation.
Empirically, the approach trains reliably without normalization layers,
exhibits strong data efficiency, and enables learning for activations under
which standard initialization methods (Xavier, He, Orthogonal) often do not
converge reliably.

*Deshu Chen,Yuchen Liu,Zhijian Zhou,Chao Qu,Yuan Qi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了Distributional Flow Critic (DFC)，一种新的评论家架构，通过学习完整的状态-动作回报分布来解决流策略中评论家表达能力不足的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 流策略在离线强化学习中表现出强大的表达能力，但其潜力往往受到评论家架构的限制——传统评论家只学习单一的标量期望回报估计，无法充分利用流策略的多模态建模能力。

Method: DFC采用流匹配技术，将回报分布建模为从简单基分布到复杂目标回报分布的连续灵活变换，而非回归到单一值。

Result: 在D4RL和OGBench基准测试中的广泛实验表明，该方法在需要多模态动作分布的任务上表现优异，在离线和离线到在线微调方面均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: DFC通过为表达性流策略提供丰富的分布式Bellman目标，提供了更稳定和信息丰富的学习信号，显著提升了离线强化学习的性能。

Abstract: Flow-based policies have recently emerged as a powerful tool in offline and
offline-to-online reinforcement learning, capable of modeling the complex,
multimodal behaviors found in pre-collected datasets. However, the full
potential of these expressive actors is often bottlenecked by their critics,
which typically learn a single, scalar estimate of the expected return. To
address this limitation, we introduce the Distributional Flow Critic (DFC), a
novel critic architecture that learns the complete state-action return
distribution. Instead of regressing to a single value, DFC employs flow
matching to model the distribution of return as a continuous, flexible
transformation from a simple base distribution to the complex target
distribution of returns. By doing so, DFC provides the expressive flow-based
policy with a rich, distributional Bellman target, which offers a more stable
and informative learning signal. Extensive experiments across D4RL and OGBench
benchmarks demonstrate that our approach achieves strong performance,
especially on tasks requiring multimodal action distributions, and excels in
both offline and offline-to-online fine-tuning compared to existing methods.

TL;DR: 对网络基础模型(NFMs)潜在知识的系统性调查，通过嵌入几何分析、度量对齐评估和因果敏感性测试三个维度评估模型，发现现有模型存在显著的各向异性、不一致的特征敏感性模式等问题，解决这些问题可显著提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注下游任务性能，而本文旨在深入分析网络基础模型中编码的潜在知识，关注隐藏表示而非纯粹的下游任务表现。

Method: 采用三部分评估方法：嵌入几何分析评估表示空间利用，度量对齐评估测量与领域专家特征的对应关系，因果敏感性测试评估对协议扰动的鲁棒性。使用五个不同的网络数据集评估四个最先进的NFMs。

Result: 发现所有模型都表现出显著的各向异性、不一致的特征敏感性模式、无法分离高层上下文、负载依赖性等问题。解决这些限制可以显著提高模型性能（F1分数最高提升0.35，无需架构更改）。

Conclusion: 这项工作揭示了网络基础模型在潜在知识编码方面的多种局限性，并证明通过解决这些问题可以显著改进模型性能，为未来NFMs的发展提供了重要见解。

Abstract: This work presents a systematic investigation into the latent knowledge
encoded within Network Foundation Models (NFMs) that focuses on hidden
representations analysis rather than pure downstream task performance.
Different from existing efforts, we analyze the models through a three-part
evaluation: Embedding Geometry Analysis to assess representation space
utilization, Metric Alignment Assessment to measure correspondence with
domain-expert features, and Causal Sensitivity Testing to evaluate robustness
to protocol perturbations. Using five diverse network datasets spanning
controlled and real-world environments, we evaluate four state-of-the-art NFMs,
revealing that they all exhibit significant anisotropy, inconsistent feature
sensitivity patterns, an inability to separate the high-level context, payload
dependency, and other properties. Our work identifies numerous limitations
across all models and demonstrates that addressing them can significantly
improve model performance (by up to +0.35 $F_1$ score without architectural
changes).

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种计算扩散模型对训练数据扰动的敏感性的方法，无需重新训练即可预测模型输出的变化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型训练将数据分布映射到最优得分函数，但重新训练成本高昂。如果能计算这种映射的导数，就能在重新训练前预测模型对训练数据扰动的响应。

Method: 开发了闭式程序计算映射的方向导数，仅需预训练得分模型及其对输入的导数。扩展该方法估计扩散模型样本对目标测度加性扰动的敏感性。

Result: 方法对数值和近似误差具有鲁棒性，计算时间与从扩散模型采样和计算样本路径对数似然相当。敏感性结果与重新训练和微调后图像扩散模型样本的变化相关。

Conclusion: 提供了一种高效计算扩散模型对训练数据扰动敏感性的工具，可在不重新训练的情况下预测模型行为变化。

Abstract: Training a diffusion model approximates a map from a data distribution $\rho$
to the optimal score function $s_t$ for that distribution. Can we differentiate
this map? If we could, then we could predict how the score, and ultimately the
model's samples, would change under small perturbations to the training set
before committing to costly retraining. We give a closed-form procedure for
computing this map's directional derivatives, relying only on black-box access
to a pre-trained score model and its derivatives with respect to its inputs. We
extend this result to estimate the sensitivity of a diffusion model's samples
to additive perturbations of its target measure, with runtime comparable to
sampling from a diffusion model and computing log-likelihoods along the sample
path. Our method is robust to numerical and approximation error, and the
resulting sensitivities correlate with changes in an image diffusion model's
samples after retraining and fine-tuning.

TL;DR: CE-PO是一个增强策略优化的框架，通过因果一致性奖励来减少语言模型的奖励攻击和不忠实推理，同时提高对因果扰动的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在强化学习训练中经常通过捷径策略获得表面正确的答案，但推理过程可能不忠实，且在小因果扰动下性能下降。

Method: 使用Jacobian敏感性估计模型内部影响，通过反事实硬化抑制噪声线索，将因果一致性分数与任务准确性反馈通过Minkowski组合器融合，集成到PPO/GRPO中。

Result: 在4个数据集上的实验显示，CE-PO平均比基线提高5.49%的准确率（最高9.58%），同时提高了对相关-因果翻转和轻量反事实编辑的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: CE-PO能有效减少奖励攻击和不忠实推理链，在保持准确性的同时显著提升模型的因果鲁棒性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) trained with reinforcement objectives often
achieve superficially correct answers via shortcut strategies, pairing correct
outputs with spurious or unfaithful reasoning and degrading under small causal
perturbations. We introduce Causally-Enhanced Policy Optimization (CE-PO), a
drop-in reward-shaping framework that augments policy optimization with a
differentiable proxy for causal coherence along the generation pathway from
prompt (Z) to rationale (X) to answer (Y). CE-PO estimates model-internal
influence with Jacobian-based sensitivities, counterfactually hardens these
signals to suppress nuisance cues, and fuses the resulting coherence score with
task-accuracy feedback via a Minkowski (power-mean) combiner, exposing a single
tunable between accuracy and coherence trade-off. The unified reward integrates
with PPO/GRPO without architectural changes. Across reasoning benchmarks and
causal stress tests, CE-PO reduces reward hacking and unfaithful
chain-of-thought while improving robustness to correlation-causation flips and
light counterfactual edits, all at near-parity accuracy. Experimental results
across 4 datasets show that CE-PO improves accuracy over baselines by 5.49% on
average (up to 9.58%), while improving robustness to correlation-causation
flips and light counterfactual edits.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了8位Muon优化器，使用分块量化技术，在保持Muon优化器性能的同时显著减少了内存占用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Muon优化器在LLM预训练中表现出比AdamW更快的收敛速度和计算效率，但像AdamW一样需要存储模型权重和累积梯度，存在内存开销问题。现有的8位AdamW变体通常只在动态量化下稳定，而本文旨在开发支持线性和动态量化的8位Muon优化器。

Method: 采用分块量化技术，开发了支持线性和动态量化方案的8位Muon优化器，并提供了理论分析来解释其在量化下的鲁棒性。

Result: 8位Muon相比全精度Muon减少了约74%的内存占用，在1.6B模型预训练实验中与Muon性能相当，同时优于AdamW和8位AdamW。在Llama 3.2 3B模型微调中也表现出竞争力。

Conclusion: 8位Muon优化器在保持Muon优化器优势的同时，显著降低了内存需求，为大规模模型训练提供了高效的内存优化解决方案。

Abstract: The Muon optimizer, based on matrix orthogonalization, has recently shown
faster convergence and up to 2x computational efficiency over AdamW in LLM
pretraining. Like AdamW, Muon is stateful, requiring storage of both model
weights and accumulated gradients. While 8-bit AdamW variants mitigate this
overhead using blockwise quantization, they are typically stable only under
dynamic quantization - which improves stability on linear quantization for
extreme values. In this paper, we introduce the 8-bit Muon optimizer using
blockwise quantization, supporting both linear and dynamic schemes. We
demonstrate that 8-bit Muon maintains stability under both, while delivering
$\sim$74\% reduction in memory footprint compared to full-precision Muon. In
extensive experiments, 8-bit Muon closely matches the performance of Muon while
outperforming AdamW and 8-bit AdamW in pre-training a 1.6B model on 4B FineWeb
tokens. It also shows competitive results when fine-tuning the Llama 3.2 3B
model on post-training data. We also provide a theoretical perspective to help
explain this robustness under quantization.

TL;DR: RHYTHM是一个基于大语言模型的人类移动预测框架，通过时间标记化和分层注意力机制，显著提高了预测精度并减少了训练时间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类移动预测面临复杂的长距离依赖和多尺度周期性行为的挑战，需要一种能够有效捕捉时空依赖关系的统一框架。

Method: 采用时间标记化将轨迹分割为日段并编码为离散标记，使用分层注意力捕捉日和周的依赖关系，通过预计算提示嵌入增强标记表示，并冻结预训练LLM骨干以减少计算复杂度。

Result: 在三个真实世界数据集上评估，RHYTHM实现了整体准确率提升2.4%，周末准确率提升5.0%，训练时间减少24.6%。

Conclusion: RHYTHM框架成功利用LLM作为通用时空预测器，在保持计算效率的同时显著提升了人类移动预测性能。

Abstract: Predicting human mobility is inherently challenging due to complex long-range
dependencies and multi-scale periodic behaviors. To address this, we introduce
RHYTHM (Reasoning with Hierarchical Temporal Tokenization for Human Mobility),
a unified framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) as
general-purpose spatio-temporal predictors and trajectory reasoners.
Methodologically, RHYTHM employs temporal tokenization to partition each
trajectory into daily segments and encode them as discrete tokens with
hierarchical attention that captures both daily and weekly dependencies,
thereby significantly reducing the sequence length while preserving cyclical
information. Additionally, we enrich token representations by adding
pre-computed prompt embeddings for trajectory segments and prediction targets
via a frozen LLM, and feeding these combined embeddings back into the LLM
backbone to capture complex interdependencies. Computationally, RHYTHM freezes
the pretrained LLM's backbone to reduce attention complexity and memory cost.
We evaluate our model against state-of-the-art methods using three real-world
datasets. Notably, RHYTHM achieves a 2.4% improvement in overall accuracy, a
5.0% increase on weekends, and a 24.6% reduction in training time. Code is

TL;DR: 提出Impute-MACFM，一种用于表格数据填补的掩码感知条件流匹配框架，能够处理随机缺失、随机缺失和非随机缺失机制，在多个基准测试中达到最先进水平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 表格数据在医疗等应用中很常见，但缺失值问题普遍存在，会降低模型准确性和可靠性。现有填补方法要么假设过于严格，要么难以处理复杂的跨特征结构，而最近的生成方法存在不稳定和推理成本高的问题。

Method: 使用掩码感知目标函数，仅在缺失条目上构建轨迹，同时约束观测条目的预测速度接近零；结合稳定性惩罚、一致性正则化和时间衰减噪声注入；推理时使用约束保持的ODE积分和每步投影来固定观测值。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，Impute-MACFM实现了最先进的性能，提供了比竞争方法更稳健、高效和高质量的填补结果。

Conclusion: 流匹配是解决表格缺失数据问题（包括纵向数据）的一个有前景的方向。

Abstract: Tabular data are central to many applications, especially longitudinal data
in healthcare, where missing values are common, undermining model fidelity and
reliability. Prior imputation methods either impose restrictive assumptions or
struggle with complex cross-feature structure, while recent generative
approaches suffer from instability and costly inference. We propose
Impute-MACFM, a mask-aware conditional flow matching framework for tabular
imputation that addresses missingness mechanisms, missing completely at random,
missing at random, and missing not at random. Its mask-aware objective builds
trajectories only on missing entries while constraining predicted velocity to
remain near zero on observed entries, using flexible nonlinear schedules.
Impute-MACFM combines: (i) stability penalties on observed positions, (ii)
consistency regularization enforcing local invariance, and (iii) time-decayed
noise injection for numeric features. Inference uses constraint-preserving
ordinary differential equation integration with per-step projection to fix
observed values, optionally aggregating multiple trajectories for robustness.
Across diverse benchmarks, Impute-MACFM achieves state-of-the-art results while
delivering more robust, efficient, and higher-quality imputation than competing
approaches, establishing flow matching as a promising direction for tabular
missing-data problems, including longitudinal data.

Motivation: 现有强化学习方法（如GRPO及其变体）在开发推理模型时存在严重的过度自信问题，阻碍了自感知推理模型的实现。

Method: 提出组序列策略梯度（GSPG）框架消除token级偏差，使用归一化序列级概率定义模型置信度，并应用交叉熵正则器将模型置信度校准到序列奖励。对于非二元奖励，采用非线性奖励归一化和自适应正则器裁剪。

Result: 在逻辑和数学推理任务中对大语言模型进行后训练，C²GSPG在推理准确性和置信度校准方面均优于最先进方法。

Conclusion: C²GSPG通过置信度校准和GSPG框架的协同作用，有效解决了强化学习在推理模型中的过度自信问题，显著提升了推理性能和置信度校准效果。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) methods, exemplified by Group Relative Policy
Optimization (GRPO) and its variants, play a central role in developing
reasoning models. However, these methods often suffer from a critical
overconfidence issue, which prevents them from achieving self-aware reasoning
models. In this study, we propose a simple yet effective confidence-calibration
group sequence policy gradient method, called C$^2$GSPG, which simultaneously
enhances reasoning performance while suppressing overconfidence. In principle,
we propose a Group Sequence Policy Gradient (GSPG) framework for learning
reasoning models, which eliminates the token-level bias commonly appearing in
GRPO and its variants. In this framework, we define the model confidence for
each reasoning problem using the normalized sequence-level probability, and
then apply a cross-entropy regularizer to calibrate the model confidence to the
sequence's reward. We demonstrate that the confidence calibration regularizer
and GSPG are collaborative for binary rewards, as their objectives always share
the same gradient direction. For non-binary rewards, we apply nonlinear reward
normalization and adaptive regularizer clipping, mitigating the potential
conflict between the two objectives. Applying C$^2$GSPG to post-train large
language models in logical and mathematical reasoning tasks, we show its
superiority over state-of-the-art methods in both reasoning accuracy and
confidence calibration. The code of C$^2$GSPG is available at
https://github.com/HaotianLiu123/CCGSPG.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代IRL方法使用对抗式训练常导致不稳定，而最近的非对抗方法缺乏理论保证。本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 提出TRRO框架，通过Minorization-Maximization过程保证单调提升；实例化为PIRO算法，结合信任区域优化。

Result: 理论上TRRO提供IRL的稳定性保证；实验显示PIRO在奖励恢复、策略模仿和样本效率上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: TRRO为IRL提供了类似TRPO的稳定性理论保证，PIRO在实践中表现出色，为IRL提供了稳定高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) learns a reward function to explain
expert demonstrations. Modern IRL methods often use the adversarial (minimax)
formulation that alternates between reward and policy optimization, which often
lead to unstable training. Recent non-adversarial IRL approaches improve
stability by jointly learning reward and policy via energy-based formulations
but lack formal guarantees. This work bridges this gap. We first present a
unified view showing canonical non-adversarial methods explicitly or implicitly
maximize the likelihood of expert behavior, which is equivalent to minimizing
the expected return gap. This insight leads to our main contribution: Trust
Region Reward Optimization (TRRO), a framework that guarantees monotonic
improvement in this likelihood via a Minorization-Maximization process. We
instantiate TRRO into Proximal Inverse Reward Optimization (PIRO), a practical
and stable IRL algorithm. Theoretically, TRRO provides the IRL counterpart to
the stability guarantees of Trust Region Policy Optimization (TRPO) in forward

### [81] [Beyond Heuristics: Globally Optimal Configuration of Implicit Neural Representations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23139)
*Sipeng Chen,Yan Zhang,Shibo Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: OptiINR是一个统一的框架，通过贝叶斯优化将隐式神经表示(INR)配置制定为优化问题，自动寻找最佳激活函数和初始化参数，替代了传统的手动调优方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前INR的有效性受到缺乏原则性配置策略的限制，包括激活函数选择、初始化尺度、层间适应等，这些选择影响性能、稳定性和泛化能力，但现有方法依赖临时启发式或暴力网格搜索，导致跨模态结果不一致。

Method: 利用贝叶斯优化高效探索离散激活函数族（如SIREN、WIRE、FINER）及其相关连续初始化参数的联合空间，用系统化的数据驱动优化过程替代碎片化手动调优。

Result: OptiINR通过提供全局最优配置，为INR设计建立了原则性基础，在多样信号处理应用中持续最大化性能。

Conclusion: OptiINR是第一个将INR配置制定为严格优化问题的统一框架，通过贝叶斯优化系统性地解决了INR配置的挑战，为隐式神经表示提供了可靠的原则性设计方法。

Abstract: Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) have emerged as a transformative
paradigm in signal processing and computer vision, excelling in tasks from
image reconstruction to 3D shape modeling. Yet their effectiveness is
fundamentally limited by the absence of principled strategies for optimal
configuration - spanning activation selection, initialization scales,
layer-wise adaptation, and their intricate interdependencies. These choices
dictate performance, stability, and generalization, but current practice relies
on ad-hoc heuristics, brute-force grid searches, or task-specific tuning, often
leading to inconsistent results across modalities. This work introduces
OptiINR, the first unified framework that formulates INR configuration as a
rigorous optimization problem. Leveraging Bayesian optimization, OptiINR
efficiently explores the joint space of discrete activation families - such as
sinusoidal (SIREN), wavelet-based (WIRE), and variable-periodic (FINER) - and
their associated continuous initialization parameters. This systematic approach
replaces fragmented manual tuning with a coherent, data-driven optimization
process. By delivering globally optimal configurations, OptiINR establishes a
principled foundation for INR design, consistently maximizing performance
across diverse signal processing applications.

*Xiaowen Ma,Shuning Ge,Fan Yang,Xiangyu Li,Yun Chen,Mengting Ma,Wei Zhang,Zhipeng Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出Temporal Mix of Experts (TMOE)机制，将键值对重新定义为局部专家，通过局部过滤无关时间戳实现自适应专家选择，同时保留全局专家以捕捉长期依赖关系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决Transformer在时间序列建模中的两个关键挑战：(1) 固有的滞后效应，历史时间戳与查询的相关性动态变化；(2) 异常段引入噪声信号降低预测准确性。

Method: 将键值对重新定义为局部专家，每个专家专注于不同的时间上下文，通过局部过滤机制为每个查询自适应选择专家，同时保留共享全局专家。在PatchTST和Timer框架中替换原始注意力机制为TMOE。

Result: 在七个真实世界长期预测基准测试中，TimeExpert和TimeExpert-G超越了最先进的方法。

Conclusion: TMOE机制有效解决了时间序列建模中的滞后效应和异常段问题，在保持Transformer长期依赖捕捉能力的同时，实现了更好的预测性能。

Abstract: Transformer-based architectures dominate time series modeling by enabling
global attention over all timestamps, yet their rigid 'one-size-fits-all'
context aggregation fails to address two critical challenges in real-world
data: (1) inherent lag effects, where the relevance of historical timestamps to
a query varies dynamically; (2) anomalous segments, which introduce noisy
signals that degrade forecasting accuracy. To resolve these problems, we
propose the Temporal Mix of Experts (TMOE), a novel attention-level mechanism
that reimagines key-value (K-V) pairs as local experts (each specialized in a
distinct temporal context) and performs adaptive expert selection for each
query via localized filtering of irrelevant timestamps. Complementing this
local adaptation, a shared global expert preserves the Transformer's strength
in capturing long-range dependencies. We then replace the vanilla attention
mechanism in popular time-series Transformer frameworks (i.e., PatchTST and
Timer) with TMOE, without extra structural modifications, yielding our specific
version TimeExpert and general version TimeExpert-G. Extensive experiments on
seven real-world long-term forecasting benchmarks demonstrate that TimeExpert
and TimeExpert-G outperform state-of-the-art methods. Code is available at

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出Mirror-Critique框架，通过对比模型生成解与真实解来训练具有信息性批判能力的验证器，显著提升推理性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于奖励模型选择的测试时缩放方法常常无法识别少数但正确的答案，限制了其超越简单多数投票的效果，这源于验证器训练中缺乏信息性批判信号。

Method: 利用小型指令调优模型通过拒绝采样合成高质量批判数据，教导验证器不仅知道什么错误，还知道为什么错误；使用合成数据冷启动RLVR过程，通过生成多个批判并聚合成验证分数用于加权投票或选择性弃权。

Result: Mirror-Verifier在解决方案准确性方面显著优于多数投票，并提高了求解器识别和弃权超出其能力边界问题的诚实性。

Conclusion: Mirror-Critique框架通过提供信息性批判信号有效提升了LLMs的推理性能验证能力。

Abstract: Test-time scaling via solution sampling and aggregation has become a key
paradigm for improving the reasoning performance of Large Language Models
(LLMs). While reward model selection is commonly employed in this approach, it
often fails to identify minority-yet-correct answers, which limits its
effectiveness beyond that of simple majority voting. We argue that this
limitation stems from a lack of informative critique signals during verifier
training. To bridge this gap, we introduce Mirror-Critique, a framework that
trains a verifier with informative critiques. Our key insight is to leverage
the rich critique signal by contrasting model-generated solutions with
ground-truth solutions. We deploy a small instruction-tuned model to synthesize
high-quality critique data with rejection sampling that teaches the verifier
not only what is wrong, but also why. The synthetic data is used to cold-start
the LLMs in the RLVR process to further improve the verification ability. The
resulting Mirror-Verifier is deployed to evaluate candidate solutions by
generating multiple critiques per solution, aggregating them into a verify
score used for weighted voting or selective abstention. The experimental
results show that our Mirror-Verifier significantly outperforms majority voting
in terms of solution accuracy and also improves the solver's honesty to
recognize and abstain from answering beyond its capability boundaries.

TL;DR: 提出了CrystalGym，一个用于晶体材料发现的开源强化学习环境，旨在将DFT计算直接整合到材料设计循环中。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前材料设计主要依赖高精度DFT计算，但机器学习方法很少直接使用DFT信号作为反馈，主要是因为DFT计算成本高昂。

Method: 开发了CrystalGym环境，在环境中使用DFT直接计算能带隙、体积模量和密度等属性，并评估了常见的基于值和基于策略的强化学习算法。

Result: 虽然基准算法未能解决所有CrystalGym任务，但实验显示了不同算法和环境设置下的样本效率和收敛到最优性的差异。

Conclusion: CrystalGym旨在成为强化学习研究者和材料科学家的测试平台，为处理耗时奖励信号的强化学习方法引入新的挑战类别。

Abstract: In silico design and optimization of new materials primarily relies on
high-accuracy atomic simulators that perform density functional theory (DFT)
calculations. While recent works showcase the strong potential of machine
learning to accelerate the material design process, they mostly consist of
generative approaches that do not use direct DFT signals as feedback to improve
training and generation mainly due to DFT's high computational cost. To aid the
adoption of direct DFT signals in the materials design loop through online
reinforcement learning (RL), we propose CrystalGym, an open-source RL
environment for crystalline material discovery. Using CrystalGym, we benchmark
common value- and policy-based reinforcement learning algorithms for designing
various crystals conditioned on target properties. Concretely, we optimize for
challenging properties like the band gap, bulk modulus, and density, which are
directly calculated from DFT in the environment. While none of the algorithms
we benchmark solve all CrystalGym tasks, our extensive experiments and
ablations show different sample efficiencies and ease of convergence to
optimality for different algorithms and environment settings. Additionally, we
include a case study on the scope of fine-tuning large language models with
reinforcement learning for improving DFT-based rewards. Our goal is for
CrystalGym to serve as a test bed for reinforcement learning researchers and
material scientists to address these real-world design problems with practical
applications. We therefore introduce a novel class of challenges for
reinforcement learning methods dealing with time-consuming reward signals,
paving the way for future interdisciplinary research for machine learning
motivated by real-world applications.

TL;DR: 使用LSTM模型结合日常行为特征序列检测认知障碍，通过常规感知增强和人口统计个性化两种技术提高模型泛化能力，在36名老年人6个月数据上AUPRC从0.637提升到0.766。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床评估频率低且缺乏敏感性，无法捕捉老年人细微的认知衰退。被动智能手机传感为自然连续认知监测提供了有前景的方法。

Method: 基于多模态传感数据提取日常行为特征序列，使用LSTM模型检测认知障碍。采用两种技术增强模型泛化性：常规感知增强（用行为相似替代日生成合成序列）和人口统计个性化（重新加权训练样本以强调与测试参与者人口统计相似的个体）。

Result: 在36名老年人6个月数据上，结合传感和人口统计特征的模型AUPRC从0.637提升到0.766。

Conclusion: 这些技术突显了使用被动传感对老龄化人群进行可扩展认知障碍监测的潜力。

Abstract: Early detection of cognitive impairment is critical for timely diagnosis and
intervention, yet infrequent clinical assessments often lack the sensitivity
and temporal resolution to capture subtle cognitive declines in older adults.
Passive smartphone sensing has emerged as a promising approach for naturalistic
and continuous cognitive monitoring. Building on this potential, we implemented
a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model to detect cognitive impairment from
sequences of daily behavioral features, derived from multimodal sensing data
collected in an ongoing one-year study of older adults. Our key contributions
are two techniques to enhance model generalizability across participants: (1)
routine-aware augmentation, which generates synthetic sequences by replacing
each day with behaviorally similar alternatives, and (2) demographic
personalization, which reweights training samples to emphasize those from
individuals demographically similar to the test participant. Evaluated on
6-month data from 36 older adults, these techniques jointly improved the Area
Under the Precision-Recall Curve (AUPRC) of the model trained on sensing and
demographic features from 0.637 to 0.766, highlighting the potential of
scalable monitoring of cognitive impairment in aging populations with passive
sensing.

TL;DR: ProtoTS是一个可解释的时间序列预测框架，通过建模原型时间模式实现高精度和透明决策，提供多层次可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有可解释模型只能提供局部和部分解释，无法揭示异质输入变量如何共同塑造预测曲线中的整体时间模式。

Method: 基于去噪表示计算实例-原型相似度，原型分层组织以捕获全局时间模式和局部细粒度变化，支持专家引导。

Result: 在多个现实基准测试中，ProtoTS不仅预测精度超过现有方法，还提供专家可引导的解释以支持模型理解和决策。

Conclusion: ProtoTS框架成功实现了时间序列预测的高精度与透明决策的平衡，为高风险场景提供了可信的决策支持。

Abstract: While deep learning has achieved impressive performance in time series
forecasting, it becomes increasingly crucial to understand its decision-making
process for building trust in high-stakes scenarios. Existing interpretable
models often provide only local and partial explanations, lacking the
capability to reveal how heterogeneous and interacting input variables jointly
shape the overall temporal patterns in the forecast curve. We propose ProtoTS,
a novel interpretable forecasting framework that achieves both high accuracy
and transparent decision-making through modeling prototypical temporal
patterns. ProtoTS computes instance-prototype similarity based on a denoised
representation that preserves abundant heterogeneous information. The
prototypes are organized hierarchically to capture global temporal patterns
with coarse prototypes while capturing finer-grained local variations with
detailed prototypes, enabling expert steering and multi-level interpretability.
Experiments on multiple realistic benchmarks, including a newly released LOF
dataset, show that ProtoTS not only exceeds existing methods in forecast
accuracy but also delivers expert-steerable interpretations for better model
understanding and decision support.

TL;DR: 将密集关联记忆从向量扩展到概率分布，特别是高斯分布，使用2-Wasserstein距离定义能量函数和检索动态，实现了分布存储和检索。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有密集关联记忆模型仅限于向量表示，无法处理概率分布。本文旨在将关联记忆扩展到分布空间，连接经典DAM与现代生成建模。

Method: 在2-Wasserstein距离下定义对数-求和-指数能量函数，检索动态通过吉布斯加权方式聚合最优传输映射，固定点对应自洽的Wasserstein重心。

Result: 证明了指数存储容量，提供了Wasserstein扰动下的定量检索保证，并在合成和真实世界分布任务上验证了模型。

Conclusion: 该工作将关联记忆从向量提升到完整分布，为记忆增强学习中的分布存储和检索提供了可能。

Abstract: Dense associative memories (DAMs) store and retrieve patterns via
energy-functional fixed points, but existing models are limited to vector
representations. We extend DAMs to probability distributions equipped with the
2-Wasserstein distance, focusing mainly on the Bures-Wasserstein class of
Gaussian densities. Our framework defines a log-sum-exp energy over stored
distributions and a retrieval dynamics aggregating optimal transport maps in a
Gibbs-weighted manner. Stationary points correspond to self-consistent
Wasserstein barycenters, generalizing classical DAM fixed points. We prove
exponential storage capacity, provide quantitative retrieval guarantees under
Wasserstein perturbations, and validate the model on synthetic and real-world
distributional tasks. This work elevates associative memory from vectors to
full distributions, bridging classical DAMs with modern generative modeling and
enabling distributional storage and retrieval in memory-augmented learning.

TL;DR: 本文首次系统研究了参数高效微调(PEFT)在科学机器学习中的应用，发现Adapter调优在大型算子模型(LOMs)上显著优于LoRA，并提出了基于频谱复杂度的频率自适应适配器(F-Adapter)，在3D Navier-Stokes基准测试中取得了最先进的结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 参数高效微调在视觉和语言处理中已证明有效，但在科学机器学习领域尚未探索，该领域的目标是建模复杂物理系统。

Method: 1. 系统比较LoRA和Adapter在大型算子模型上的性能；2. 理论分析LoRA在傅里叶层中的近似误差问题；3. 提出频率自适应适配器(F-Adapter)，根据频谱复杂度分配适配器容量。

Result: F-Adapter在多个挑战性的3D Navier-Stokes基准测试中建立了最先进的结果，显著提高了泛化能力和频谱保真度，优于LoRA和其他PEFT技术。

Conclusion: 这是首个探索科学机器学习中PEFT的工作，确立了F-Adapter作为该领域的有效范式，特别适合处理偏微分方程解的频谱稀疏特性。

Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) of powerful pre-trained models for
complex downstream tasks has proven effective in vision and language
processing, yet this paradigm remains unexplored in scientific machine
learning, where the objective is to model complex physical systems. We conduct
the first systematic study of PEFT for pre-trained Large Operator Models (LOMs)
obtained by scaling variants of Fourier Neural Operator. First, we observe that
the widely used Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) yields markedly poorer performance
on LOMs than Adapter tuning. Then, we further theoretically establish that
stacked LoRA incurs a depth-amplified lower bound on approximation error within
Fourier layers, whereas adapters retain universal approximation capacity and,
by concentrating parameters on energy-dominant low-frequency modes, attain
exponentially decaying error with bottleneck width in the Fourier domain.
Motivated by the robust empirical gains of adapters and by our theoretical
characterization of PDE solutions as spectrally sparse, we introduce
Frequency-Adaptive Adapter (F-Adapter). F-Adapter allocates adapter capacity
based on spectral complexity, assigning higher-dimension modules to
low-frequency components and lower-dimension modules to high-frequency
components. Our F-Adapters establish state-of-the-art (SOTA) results on
multiple challenging 3D Navier-Stokes benchmarks, markedly enhancing both
generalization and spectral fidelity over LoRA and other PEFT techniques
commonly used in LLMs. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first to
explore PEFT for scientific machine-learning and establishes F-Adapter as an
effective paradigm for this domain.

TL;DR: 提出了ZeroSiam方法，通过非对称孪生架构解决测试时熵最小化中的崩溃问题，防止模型陷入平凡解，提升泛化性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 测试时熵最小化虽然能提升模型在新环境中的适应性和推理能力，但纯熵最小化容易导致模型选择非泛化的捷径（如放大logit范数或将所有预测推向主导类别），产生崩溃解。

Method: 设计了ZeroSiam，一种高效的非对称孪生架构，通过可学习的预测器和分类器前的停止梯度操作实现非对称散度对齐，防止崩溃。

Result: 实验证明ZeroSiam不仅能防止崩溃解，还能吸收和正则化有偏学习信号，在各种测试场景和不同模型（包括容易崩溃的小模型）上表现稳定且高效。

Conclusion: ZeroSiam在视觉适应和大语言模型推理任务中均表现出色，以可忽略的开销实现了比先前方法更稳定的性能。

Abstract: Test-time entropy minimization helps adapt a model to novel environments and
incentivize its reasoning capability, unleashing the model's potential during
inference by allowing it to evolve and improve in real-time using its own
predictions, achieving promising performance. However, pure entropy
minimization can favor non-generalizable shortcuts, such as inflating the logit
norm and driving all predictions to a dominant class to reduce entropy, risking
collapsed solutions (e.g., constant one-hot outputs) that trivially minimize
the objective without meaningful learning. In this paper, we introduce
ZeroSiam, an efficient asymmetric Siamese architecture tailored for test-time
entropy minimization. ZeroSiam prevents collapse through asymmetric divergence
alignment, which is efficiently achieved by a learnable predictor and a
stop-gradient operator before the classifier. We provide empirical and
theoretical evidence that ZeroSiam not only prevents collapse solutions, but
also absorbs and regularizes biased learning signals, enhancing performance
even when no collapse occurs. Despite its simplicity, extensive results show
that ZeroSiam performs more stably over prior methods using negligible
overhead, demonstrating efficacy on both vision adaptation and large language
model reasoning tasks across challenging test scenarios and diverse models,
including tiny models that are particularly collapse-prone.

Motivation: 联邦学习面临恶意客户端攻击和激励参与者贡献高质量数据的挑战，需要在严格隐私要求下确保系统安全性和参与积极性。

Method: 使用主动警报机制和鲁棒聚合防御拜占庭和推理攻击，采用Tullock竞赛启发的激励机制，将服务器与客户端交互建模为两阶段Stackelberg博弈。

Result: 实验结果表明CoSIFL在提高模型鲁棒性和降低服务器总成本方面优于现有解决方案。

Conclusion: CoSIFL的集成设计有效解决了联邦学习中的安全和激励问题，证明了多维度属性对系统效率的联合影响。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) has emerged as a promising paradigm for collaborative
model training while preserving data locality. However, it still faces
challenges from malicious or compromised clients, as well as difficulties in
incentivizing participants to contribute high-quality data under strict privacy
requirements. Motivated by these considerations, we propose CoSIFL, a novel
framework that integrates proactive alarming for robust security and local
differential privacy (LDP) for inference attacks, together with a
Stackelberg-based incentive scheme to encourage client participation and data
sharing. Specifically, CoSIFL uses an active alarming mechanism and robust
aggregation to defend against Byzantine and inference attacks, while a Tullock
contest-inspired incentive module rewards honest clients for both data
contributions and reliable alarm triggers. We formulate the interplay between
the server and clients as a two-stage game: in the first stage, the server
determines total rewards, selects participants, and fixes global iteration
settings, whereas in the second stage, each client decides its mini-batch size,
privacy noise scale, and alerting strategy. We prove that the server-client
game admits a unique equilibrium, and analyze how clients' multi-dimensional
attributes - such as non-IID degrees and privacy budgets - jointly affect
system efficiency. Experimental results on standard benchmarks demonstrate that
CoSIFL outperforms state-of-the-art solutions in improving model robustness and
reducing total server costs, highlighting the effectiveness of our integrated
design.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 硬件加速的4位浮点格式（MXFP4和NVFP4）有望革新大语言模型推理，但其实际效益尚未得到验证。需要研究这些格式在实际应用中的表现，并解决现有量化方法在FP4上面临的挑战。

Method: 提出Micro-Rotated-GPTQ (MR-GPTQ)方法，通过块级Hadamard变换和格式特定优化来适应FP4的独特属性。开发高性能GPU内核，通过权重旋转融合和快速在线激活计算实现高效推理。

Result: MR-GPTQ在NVIDIA B200上实现层间3.6倍和端到端2.2倍加速，在RTX5090上实现层间6倍和端到端4倍加速。显著提升MXFP4精度，使其接近NVFP4水平。

Conclusion: 虽然FP4不是INT4的自动升级，但像MR-GPTQ这样的格式专用方法可以开启精度-性能权衡的新前沿。

Abstract: The recent hardware-accelerated microscaling 4-bit floating-point formats
such as MXFP4 and NVFP4, supported on NVIDIA and AMD GPUs, promise to
revolutionize large language model (LLM) inference. Yet, their practical
benefits remain unproven. We present the first comprehensive study of MXFP4 and
NVFP4 for post-training quantization, revealing gaps between their promise and
real-world performance. Our analysis shows that state-of-the-art methods
struggle with FP4, due to two key issues: (1) NVFP4's small group size provably
neutralizes traditional outlier mitigation techniques; (2) MXFP4's power-of-two
scale quantization severely degrades accuracy due to high induced error. To
bridge this gap, we introduce Micro-Rotated-GPTQ (MR-GPTQ), a variant of the
classic GPTQ quantization algorithm that tailors the quantization process to
FP4's unique properties, by using block-wise Hadamard transforms and
format-specific optimizations. We support our proposal with a set of
high-performance GPU kernels that enable the MR-GPTQ format with negligible
overhead, by rotation fusion into the weights, and fast online computation of
the activations. This leads to speedups vs. FP16 of up to 3.6x layer-wise, and
2.2x end-to-end on NVIDIA B200, and of 6x layer-wise and 4x end-to-end on
RTX5090. Our extensive empirical evaluation demonstrates that MR-GPTQ matches
or outperforms state-of-the-art accuracy, significantly boosting MXFP4, to the
point where it nears that of NVFP4. We conclude that, while FP4 is not an
automatic upgrade over INT4, format-specialized methods like MR-GPTQ can unlock
a new frontier of accuracy-performance trade-offs.

Motivation: 现有ICRL方法在训练时使用单调策略改进数据，但在测试时无法持续改进性能。研究发现这是由于上下文模糊性导致的，模型自身的随机动作可能生成与训练数据中次优策略相似的交互历史，从而引发恶性循环。

Result: 在Dark Room和Minigrid测试平台上进行的实验表明，CV-ICRL有效缓解了性能下降问题，并在各种任务和环境中提升了ICRL的整体能力。

Conclusion: CV-ICRL通过引入上下文价值解决了上下文模糊性问题，为ICRL提供了更可靠的性能保证，证明了该方法在提升上下文强化学习能力方面的有效性。

Abstract: In-Context Reinforcement Learning (ICRL) has emerged as a promising paradigm
for developing agents that can rapidly adapt to new tasks by leveraging past
experiences as context, without updating their parameters. Recent approaches
train large sequence models on monotonic policy improvement data from online
RL, aiming to a continue improved testing time performance. However, our
experimental analysis reveals a critical flaw: these models cannot show a
continue improvement like the training data during testing time. Theoretically,
we identify this phenomenon as Contextual Ambiguity, where the model's own
stochastic actions can generate an interaction history that misleadingly
resembles that of a sub-optimal policy from the training data, initiating a
vicious cycle of poor action selection. To resolve the Contextual Ambiguity, we
introduce Context Value into training phase and propose Context Value Informed
ICRL (CV-ICRL). CV-ICRL use Context Value as an explicit signal representing
the ideal performance theoretically achievable by a policy given the current
context. As the context expands, Context Value could include more task-relevant
information, and therefore the ideal performance should be non-decreasing. We
prove that the Context Value tightens the lower bound on the performance gap
relative to an ideal, monotonically improving policy. We fruther propose two
methods for estimating Context Value at both training and testing time.
Experiments conducted on the Dark Room and Minigrid testbeds demonstrate that
CV-ICRL effectively mitigates performance degradation and improves overall ICRL
abilities across various tasks and environments. The source code and data of
this paper are available at

Motivation: 大型语言模型在通用数学推理上表现良好，但在需要精确操作信息论边界、优化约束和信号处理公式的无线通信技术数学问题上表现不佳。

Method: 使用具有可验证正确性的无线数学问题，通过Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO)和二元验证奖励进行领域特定强化学习，无需监督预热。

Result: 7B模型在WirelessMathBench-XL上达到39.5%准确率，接近GPT-4o(40.4%)，而参数量仅为DeepSeek-R1(671B, 57.4%)的约1/100。GRPO训练使所有模型规模性能几乎翻倍，并在未训练的情况下提升了通用数学基准表现。

Conclusion: 紧凑模型通过领域特定的强化学习可以在专业数学任务上达到大模型性能，且具有正向迁移到通用数学任务的能力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at general mathematical reasoning but fail
catastrophically on specialized technical mathematics. In wireless
communications, where problems require precise manipulation of
information-theoretic bounds, optimization constraints, and signal processing
formulations, even state-of-the-art models struggle to achieve competent
performance. We present WirelessMathLM, demonstrating that compact models
(0.5B-7B parameters) can match or exceed much larger models through
domain-specific reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards. Our key insight
is that wireless mathematics problems possess a unique property--verifiable
correctness--that enables effective reinforcement learning without human
feedback. We construct WirelessMathBench-XL, a comprehensive benchmark of 4,027
problems from 970 papers. Using Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with
binary verification rewards, we train models directly from base checkpoints
without supervised warm-start. Our 7B model achieves 39.5% accuracy on
WirelessMathBench-XL, approaching GPT-4o (40.4%) while using about 100 times
fewer parameters than DeepSeek-R1 (671B, 57.4%). Remarkably, GRPO training
nearly doubles performance across all model scales (0.5B +11%, 3B +103%, 7B
+81%), with positive transfer to general mathematics benchmarks--our models
gain +8.4 points on average across MATH, Minerva-Math, OlympiadBench, AMC, and
AIME without any training on these tasks.

### [95] [SPEC-RL: Accelerating On-Policy Reinforcement Learning via Speculative Rollouts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23232)
*Bingshuai Liu,Ante Wang,Zijun Min,Liang Yao,Haibo Zhang,Yang Liu,Anxiang Zeng,Jinsong Su*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SPEC-RL是一个新颖框架，通过将推测性解码与RL rollout过程集成，利用先前轨迹段作为推测前缀进行扩展，减少冗余计算，将rollout时间减少2-3倍而不影响策略质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有加速方法（如并行化、目标驱动修改、重放缓冲区）存在收益递减、引入偏差或忽略迭代间冗余的问题。连续训练时期的rollout经常包含大量重叠段，浪费计算资源。

Method: SPEC-RL重用先前的轨迹段作为推测前缀，通过草稿-验证机制进行扩展，避免冗余生成同时确保策略一致性。

Result: 在GSM8K、MATH-500、OlympiadBench、MMLU-STEM等多个数学推理和泛化基准测试中，SPEC-RL将rollout时间减少2-3倍，且不损害策略质量。

Conclusion: SPEC-RL作为纯rollout阶段增强，可与主流算法（PPO、GRPO、DAPO）无缝集成，为大规模推理模型的RLVR扩展提供了通用实用的路径。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly rely on reinforcement learning with
verifiable rewards (RLVR) to elicit reliable chain-of-thought reasoning.
However, the training process remains bottlenecked by the computationally
expensive rollout stage. Existing acceleration methods-such as parallelization,
objective- and data-driven modifications, and replay buffers-either incur
diminishing returns, introduce bias, or overlook redundancy across iterations.
We identify that rollouts from consecutive training epochs frequently share a
large portion of overlapping segments, wasting computation. To address this, we
propose SPEC-RL, a novel framework that integrates SPECulative decoding with
the RL rollout process. SPEC-RL reuses prior trajectory segments as speculative
prefixes and extends them via a draft-and-verify mechanism, avoiding redundant
generation while ensuring policy consistency. Experiments on diverse math
reasoning and generalization benchmarks, including GSM8K, MATH-500,
OlympiadBench, MMLU-STEM, and others, demonstrate that SPEC-RL reduces rollout
time by 2-3x without compromising policy quality. As a purely rollout-stage
enhancement, SPEC-RL integrates seamlessly with mainstream algorithms (e.g.,
PPO, GRPO, DAPO), offering a general and practical path to scale RLVR for large
reasoning models. Our code is available at https://github.com/ShopeeLLM/Spec-RL

*Shayan Alahyari*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出LatentDiff框架，使用条件扩散模型在潜在表示空间中合成高质量特征，解决深度不平衡回归问题，在保持整体精度的同时显著提升少数区域的预测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界回归任务中数据分布严重偏斜，模型主要从丰富的多数样本中学习，但无法准确预测少数标签。虽然不平衡分类已被广泛研究，但不平衡回归相对较少探索。深度不平衡回归缺乏适合高维数据的专用数据级解决方案。

Method: 提出LatentDiff框架，使用条件扩散模型和基于优先级的生成方法，在潜在表示空间中合成高质量特征。该方法计算高效，适用于图像、文本等多种高维数据模态。

Result: 在三个深度不平衡回归基准测试上的实验表明，该方法在少数区域取得了显著改进，同时保持了整体准确性。

Conclusion: LatentDiff填补了深度不平衡回归领域数据级解决方案的空白，为处理高维不平衡回归问题提供了有效的框架。

Abstract: In many real-world regression tasks, the data distribution is heavily skewed,
and models learn predominantly from abundant majority samples while failing to
predict minority labels accurately. While imbalanced classification has been
extensively studied, imbalanced regression remains relatively unexplored. Deep
imbalanced regression (DIR) represents cases where the input data are
high-dimensional and unstructured. Although several data-level approaches for
tabular imbalanced regression exist, deep imbalanced regression currently lacks
dedicated data-level solutions suitable for high-dimensional data and relies
primarily on algorithmic modifications. To fill this gap, we propose
LatentDiff, a novel framework that uses conditional diffusion models with
priority-based generation to synthesize high-quality features in the latent
representation space. LatentDiff is computationally efficient and applicable
across diverse data modalities, including images, text, and other
high-dimensional inputs. Experiments on three DIR benchmarks demonstrate
substantial improvements in minority regions while maintaining overall
accuracy.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了ATDP方法，通过为敏感和非敏感token分配不同梯度权重，在训练早期使用更大噪声尺度快速破坏敏感内容记忆，显著减少DP训练时间约90%，同时保持模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM经常记忆敏感信息引发隐私担忧，现有DPSGD方法在所有梯度步骤注入均匀噪声，导致训练时间显著延长和模型准确率下降。

Method: ATDP方法修改标准DP-SGD，自适应地为敏感和非敏感token分配不同梯度权重，在训练早期使用更大噪声尺度，仅需少量轻量级后处理阶段。

Result: ATDP显著减少DP微调的计算开销，缩短训练时间约90%，实现可比或更优的隐私保护，同时最小化准确率下降。

Conclusion: ATDP可无缝集成到现有DP微调流程中，或直接应用于非私有模型作为快速隐私增强措施，形成高效的DP流水线。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) frequently memorize sensitive or personal
information, raising significant privacy concerns. Existing variants of
differential privacy stochastic gradient descent (DPSGD) inject uniform noise
into every gradient step, significantly extending training time and reducing
model accuracy. We propose that concentrating noise primarily on gradients
associated with sensitive tokens can substantially decrease DP training time,
strengthen the protection of sensitive information, and simultaneously preserve
the model's performance on non-sensitive data. We operationalize this insight
through Adaptive Token-Weighted Differential Privacy (ATDP), a modification of
vanilla DP-SGD that adaptively assigns different gradient weights to sensitive
and non-sensitive tokens. By employing a larger noise scale at the early stage
of training, ATDP rapidly disrupts memorization of sensitive content. As a
result, ATDP only requires a few additional epochs of lightweight
post-processing following standard fine-tuning, injecting targeted noise
primarily on parameters corresponding to sensitive tokens, thus minimally
affecting the model's general capabilities. ATDP can be seamlessly integrated
into any existing DP-based fine-tuning pipeline or directly applied to
non-private models as a fast privacy-enhancing measure. Additionally, combined
with an initial redacted fine-tuning phase, ATDP forms a streamlined DP
pipeline that achieves comparable canary protection to state-of-the-art DP-SGD
methods, significantly reduces the computational overhead of DP fine-tuning,
shortening training time by approximately 90 percent, while achieving
comparable or superior privacy protection and minimal accuracy degradation.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于神经网络的高维参数空间子空间回归方法，用于降阶建模。通过预测比所需维度更大的子空间来简化学习问题，提高准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统参数化降阶建模中，高维参数空间使得经典插值策略不可行或不可靠，需要更有效的方法来处理子空间数据的近似问题。

Method: 将插值问题放松为回归问题，引入适合子空间数据的损失函数，使用神经网络近似高维目标函数，并通过预测更大维度的子空间来简化学习问题。

Result: 理论分析表明该方法降低了椭圆特征问题的映射复杂度，并使Grassmann流形上的光滑映射更平滑。实证结果显示预测更大子空间能显著提高准确性。

Conclusion: 子空间回归方法在参数特征问题、紧缩技术、松弛方法、最优控制和参数偏微分方程求解等多种任务中具有实用价值。

Abstract: It is often possible to perform reduced order modelling by specifying linear
subspace which accurately captures the dynamics of the system. This approach
becomes especially appealing when linear subspace explicitly depends on
parameters of the problem. A practical way to apply such a scheme is to compute
subspaces for a selected set of parameters in the computationally demanding
offline stage and in the online stage approximate subspace for unknown
parameters by interpolation. For realistic problems the space of parameters is
high dimensional, which renders classical interpolation strategies infeasible
or unreliable. We propose to relax the interpolation problem to regression,
introduce several loss functions suitable for subspace data, and use a neural
network as an approximation to high-dimensional target function. To further
simplify a learning problem we introduce redundancy: in place of predicting
subspace of a given dimension we predict larger subspace. We show theoretically
that this strategy decreases the complexity of the mapping for elliptic
eigenproblems with constant coefficients and makes the mapping smoother for
general smooth function on the Grassmann manifold. Empirical results also show
that accuracy significantly improves when larger-than-needed subspaces are
predicted. With the set of numerical illustrations we demonstrate that subspace
regression can be useful for a range of tasks including parametric
eigenproblems, deflation techniques, relaxation methods, optimal control and
solution of parametric partial differential equations.

Abstract: We present NanoFlux, a novel adversarial framework for generating targeted
training data to improve LLM reasoning, where adversarially-generated datasets
containing fewer than 200 examples outperform conventional fine-tuning
approaches. The framework employs a competitive dynamic between models
alternating as Attacker and Defender, supervised by a tool-augmented Judge,
synthesizing multi-step questions with explanatory annotations that target
specific reasoning capabilities. Fine-tuning a 4B-parameter model on
NanoFlux-generated data yields performance gains across diverse domains
compared to full-benchmark fine-tuning: +5.9% on mathematical reasoning
(GSMHard), +3.6% on scientific reasoning (GenomeBench), and +16.6% on medical
reasoning (MultiMedQA), while reducing computational requirements by 3-14x.
Ablation studies reveal a non-monotonic relationship between dataset
characteristics and model performance, uncovering domain-specific optimal
points for question complexity and reasoning quality. NanoFlux automates
training data generation through embedding-based novelty filtering,
tool-augmented evaluation, and multi-hop reasoning, suggesting that future
model improvements may lie in the intelligent synthesis of small, precisely
targeted training datasets.

Motivation: 准确预测抗体-抗原界面对于疫苗设计、免疫诊断和治疗性抗体开发至关重要，但目前仅从序列进行可靠预测仍具挑战性。

Method: 采用Conformer骨干网络捕获生物序列的局部和全局特征，引入物理启发的滑动注意力机制，无需三维结构数据即可实现残基级接触恢复。

Result: 在SARS-CoV-2抗体-抗原数据集上达到最先进性能，在抗体无关表位预测方面超越广泛使用的序列方法，消融研究证实滑动注意力显著提升表位预测精度。

Conclusion: ABCONFORMER能够仅从序列准确预测抗体-抗原界面，为疫苗和治疗性抗体开发提供有力工具，代码将在接受后开源。

Abstract: Accurate prediction of antibody-antigen (Ab-Ag) interfaces is critical for
vaccine design, immunodiagnostics, and therapeutic antibody development.
However, achieving reliable predictions from sequences alone remains a
challenge. In this paper, we present ABCONFORMER, a model based on the
Conformer backbone that captures both local and global features of a
biosequence. To accurately capture Ab-Ag interactions, we introduced the
physics-inspired sliding attention, enabling residue-level contact recovery
without relying on three-dimensional structural data. ABConformer can
accurately predict paratopes and epitopes given the antibody and antigen
sequence, and predict pan-epitopes on the antigen without antibody information.
In comparison experiments, ABCONFORMER achieves state-of-the-art performance on
a recent SARS-CoV-2 Ab-Ag dataset, and surpasses widely used sequence-based
methods for antibody-agnostic epitope prediction. Ablation studies further
quantify the contribution of each component, demonstrating that, compared to
conventional cross-attention, sliding attention significantly enhances the
precision of epitope prediction. To facilitate reproducibility, we will release
the code under an open-source license upon acceptance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有扩散模型推理时控制方法主要依赖启发式引导或与SMC结合进行偏差校正，需要更灵活高效的替代方案

Method: 使用副本交换算法，顺序生成粒子，在预热期后保持样本多样性，支持在线优化和提前终止

Result: 在温度退火、奖励倾斜、模型组合和分类器无引导去偏等多种任务中表现优异，性能与现有SMC方法相当

Conclusion: CREPE为扩散模型推理时控制提供了灵活高效的替代方案，具有顺序生成、样本多样性和在线优化等优势

Abstract: Inference-time control of diffusion models aims to steer model outputs to
satisfy new constraints without retraining. Previous approaches have mostly
relied on heuristic guidance or have been coupled with Sequential Monte Carlo
(SMC) for bias correction. In this paper, we propose a flexible alternative
based on replica exchange, an algorithm designed initially for sampling
problems. We refer to this method as the CREPE (Controlling with REPlica
Exchange). Unlike SMC, CREPE: (1) generates particles sequentially, (2)
maintains high diversity in the generated samples after a burn-in period, and
(3) enables online refinement or early termination. We demonstrate its
versatility across various tasks, including temperature annealing,
reward-tilting, model composition and classifier-free guidance debiasing, with
competitive performance compared to prior SMC methods.

TL;DR: 该研究比较了三种机器学习方法（迁移学习、从头机器学习、集成整合）在乳腺癌生存预后预测中的表现，发现这些方法在PREDICT v3工具因信息缺失无法预测的情况下仍能有效工作，并改善了预测校准度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基因组预后工具成本高且可及性有限，而临床病理预后更经济实用。机器学习、迁移学习和集成整合为构建稳健的预后框架提供了机会。

Method: 使用MA.27试验数据进行模型训练，在TEAM试验和SEER队列中进行外部验证。采用迁移学习微调PREDICT v3、从头机器学习（随机生存森林和极端梯度提升）以及通过加权求和实现集成整合。

Result: 迁移学习、从头RSF和集成整合在MA.27中改善了校准度（ICI从0.042降至≤0.007），区分度保持相当（AUC从0.738提升至0.744-0.799）。ML模型能处理PREDICT v3因信息缺失无法预测的病例（23.8-25.8%）。

Conclusion: 当PREDICT v3所需相关信息缺失或可能存在数据集偏移时，迁移学习、从头RSF和集成整合可以改善乳腺癌预后预测。

Abstract: Prognostic information is essential for decision-making in breast cancer
management. Recently trials have predominantly focused on genomic
prognostication tools, even though clinicopathological prognostication is less
costly and more widely accessible. Machine learning (ML), transfer learning and
ensemble integration offer opportunities to build robust prognostication
frameworks. We evaluate this potential to improve survival prognostication in
breast cancer by comparing de-novo ML, transfer learning from a pre-trained
prognostic tool and ensemble integration. Data from the MA.27 trial was used
for model training, with external validation on the TEAM trial and a SEER
cohort. Transfer learning was applied by fine-tuning the pre-trained prognostic
tool PREDICT v3, de-novo ML included Random Survival Forests and Extreme
Gradient Boosting, and ensemble integration was realized through a weighted sum
of model predictions. Transfer learning, de-novo RSF, and ensemble integration
improved calibration in MA.27 over the pre-trained model (ICI reduced from
0.042 in PREDICT v3 to <=0.007) while discrimination remained comparable (AUC
increased from 0.738 in PREDICT v3 to 0.744-0.799). Invalid PREDICT v3
predictions were observed in 23.8-25.8% of MA.27 individuals due to missing
information. In contrast, ML models and ensemble integration could predict
survival regardless of missing information. Across all models, patient age,
nodal status, pathological grading and tumor size had the highest SHAP values,
indicating their importance for survival prognostication. External validation
in SEER, but not in TEAM, confirmed the benefits of transfer learning, RSF and
ensemble integration. This study demonstrates that transfer learning, de-novo
RSF, and ensemble integration can improve prognostication in situations where
relevant information for PREDICT v3 is lacking or where a dataset shift is
likely.

Conclusion: 该方法的优越性并非来自复杂神经网络或改进的参数估计，而是源于无需学习环境就能直接学习最优ALM策略的能力。

Abstract: This paper proposes a novel approach for Asset-Liability Management (ALM) by
employing continuous-time Reinforcement Learning (RL) with a linear-quadratic
(LQ) formulation that incorporates both interim and terminal objectives. We
develop a model-free, policy gradient-based soft actor-critic algorithm
tailored to ALM for dynamically synchronizing assets and liabilities. To ensure
an effective balance between exploration and exploitation with minimal tuning,
we introduce adaptive exploration for the actor and scheduled exploration for
the critic. Our empirical study evaluates this approach against two enhanced
traditional financial strategies, a model-based continuous-time RL method, and
three state-of-the-art RL algorithms. Evaluated across 200 randomized market
scenarios, our method achieves higher average rewards than all alternative
strategies, with rapid initial gains and sustained superior performance. The
outperformance stems not from complex neural networks or improved parameter
estimation, but from directly learning the optimal ALM strategy without
learning the environment.

Abstract: Accurate aircraft trajectory prediction is critical for air traffic
management, airline operations, and environmental assessment. This paper
introduces NODE-FDM, a Neural Ordinary Differential Equations-based Flight
Dynamics Model trained on Quick Access Recorder (QAR) data. By combining
analytical kinematic relations with data-driven components, NODE-FDM achieves a
more accurate reproduction of recorded trajectories than state-of-the-art
models such as a BADA-based trajectory generation methodology (BADA4
performance model combined with trajectory control routines), particularly in
the descent phase of the flight. The analysis demonstrates marked improvements
across altitude, speed, and mass dynamics. Despite current limitations,
including limited physical constraints and the limited availability of QAR
data, the results demonstrate the potential of physics-informed neural ordinary
differential equations as a high-fidelity, data-driven approach to aircraft
performance modelling. Future work will extend the framework to incorporate a
full modelling of the lateral dynamics of the aircraft.

Conclusion: ASTGI框架通过自适应时空图交互有效解决了不规则多元时间序列预测中的关键挑战，在多个领域展现出优越性能。

Abstract: Irregular multivariate time series (IMTS) are prevalent in critical domains
like healthcare and finance, where accurate forecasting is vital for proactive
decision-making. However, the asynchronous sampling and irregular intervals
inherent to IMTS pose two core challenges for existing methods: (1) how to
accurately represent the raw information of irregular time series without
introducing data distortion, and (2) how to effectively capture the complex
dynamic dependencies between observation points. To address these challenges,
we propose the Adaptive Spatio-Temporal Graph Interaction (ASTGI) framework.
Specifically, the framework first employs a Spatio-Temporal Point
Representation module to encode each discrete observation as a point within a
learnable spatio-temporal embedding space. Second, a Neighborhood-Adaptive
Graph Construction module adaptively builds a causal graph for each point in
the embedding space via nearest neighbor search. Subsequently, a
Spatio-Temporal Dynamic Propagation module iteratively updates information on
these adaptive causal graphs by generating messages and computing interaction
weights based on the relative spatio-temporal positions between points.
Finally, a Query Point-based Prediction module generates the final forecast by
aggregating neighborhood information for a new query point and performing
regression. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate
that ASTGI outperforms various state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: 循环深度transformer的迭代过程具有两尺度几何特性，基于二阶步长差的早退机制是更优的退出策略。

Abstract: Recurrent-depth transformers scale test-time compute by iterating latent
computations before emitting tokens. We study the geometry of these iterates
and argue for a simple, \emph{two-scale} operational picture: (i) within a
looped block, updates act as \emph{small-scale refinements}; (ii) across
consecutive blocks, states undergo a \emph{larger-scale drift}. Across
checkpoints, our measurements show that loop steps become \emph{smaller} and
increasingly \emph{orthogonal} to one another, indicating better local modeling
of fine structure rather than merely pushing in a single direction. These
dynamics motivate an early-exit mechanism based on the model's second-order
difference in step-size, which we show is superior in terms of performance,
stability and time-efficiency, when compared to the KL-divergence exit strategy
of Geiping et al. and its naive first-order counterpart.

or demand heavy storage. In this work, we address the problem of matrix-valued
regression, where each sample is naturally represented as a matrix. We propose
MELCOT, a hybrid model that integrates a classical machine learning-based
Marginal Estimation (ME) block with a deep learning-based Learnable-Cost
Optimal Transport (LCOT) block. The ME block estimates data marginals to
preserve spatial information, while the LCOT block learns complex global
features. This design enables MELCOT to inherit the strengths of both classical
and deep learning methods. Extensive experiments across diverse datasets and
domains demonstrate that MELCOT consistently outperforms all baselines while
remaining highly efficient.

TL;DR: 提出了一个可识别的时间因果表示学习框架，用于解决大型语言模型中稀疏自编码器缺乏时间依赖建模和理论保证的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有稀疏自编码器方法缺乏时间依赖建模、瞬时关系表示和理论保证，限制了LLM内部表示的理解。因果表示学习虽然有理论基础，但无法扩展到LLM的高维概念空间。

Method: 开发了一个可识别的时间因果表示学习框架，专门针对LLM的高维概念空间设计，能够捕捉时间延迟和瞬时因果关系。

Result: 在合成数据集上验证了方法的有效性，通过将稀疏自编码器技术与时间因果框架结合，成功发现了LLM激活中有意义的概念关系。

Conclusion: 同时建模时间和瞬时概念关系能够显著推进大型语言模型的可解释性。

Abstract: Despite Large Language Models' remarkable capabilities, understanding their
internal representations remains challenging. Mechanistic interpretability
tools such as sparse autoencoders (SAEs) were developed to extract
interpretable features from LLMs but lack temporal dependency modeling,
instantaneous relation representation, and more importantly theoretical
guarantees, undermining both the theoretical foundations and the practical
confidence necessary for subsequent analyses. While causal representation
learning (CRL) offers theoretically grounded approaches for uncovering latent
concepts, existing methods cannot scale to LLMs' rich conceptual space due to
inefficient computation. To bridge the gap, we introduce an identifiable
temporal causal representation learning framework specifically designed for
LLMs' high-dimensional concept space, capturing both time-delayed and
instantaneous causal relations. Our approach provides theoretical guarantees
and demonstrates efficacy on synthetic datasets scaled to match real-world
complexity. By extending SAE techniques with our temporal causal framework, we
successfully discover meaningful concept relationships in LLM activations. Our
findings show that modeling both temporal and instantaneous conceptual
relationships advances the interpretability of LLMs.

TL;DR: 该论文研究了从非鲁棒预训练模型进行鲁棒微调(RFT)的挑战，发现了次优迁移现象，并提出了Epsilon-Scheduling方法和预期鲁棒性指标来解决这一问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管开源库中有大量非鲁棒预训练模型，但它们在鲁棒微调方面的潜力尚未被充分理解。现有方法在使用鲁棒目标微调非鲁棒模型时，即使在小的扰动下也会导致性能下降。

Method: 提出了Epsilon-Scheduling方法，通过在训练过程中对扰动强度进行调度来促进最优迁移；同时引入了预期鲁棒性指标，用于更全面地评估模型在测试时在多种扰动下的性能。

Result: 在广泛的配置实验（6个预训练模型和5个数据集）中，Epsilon-Scheduling方法成功防止了次优迁移，并持续提高了预期鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 使用鲁棒目标微调非鲁棒模型会阻碍任务适应并阻止最优迁移，但通过Epsilon-Scheduling方法可以有效解决这一问题，提升模型的鲁棒性表现。

Abstract: Fine-tuning pretrained models is a standard and effective workflow in modern
machine learning. However, robust fine-tuning (RFT), which aims to
simultaneously achieve adaptation to a downstream task and robustness to
adversarial examples, remains challenging. Despite the abundance of non-robust
pretrained models in open-source repositories, their potential for RFT is less
understood. We address this knowledge gap by systematically examining RFT from
such non-robust models. Our experiments reveal that fine-tuning non-robust
models with a robust objective, even under small perturbations, can lead to
poor performance, a phenomenon that we dub \emph{suboptimal transfer}. In
challenging scenarios (eg, difficult tasks, high perturbation), the resulting
performance can be so low that it may be considered a transfer failure. We find
that fine-tuning using a robust objective impedes task adaptation at the
beginning of training and eventually prevents optimal transfer. However, we
propose a novel heuristic, \emph{Epsilon-Scheduling}, a schedule over
perturbation strength used during training that promotes optimal transfer.
Additionally, we introduce \emph{expected robustness}, a metric that captures
performance across a range of perturbations, providing a more comprehensive
evaluation of the accuracy-robustness trade-off for diverse models at test
time. Extensive experiments on a wide range of configurations (six pretrained
models and five datasets) show that \emph{Epsilon-Scheduling} successfully
prevents \emph{suboptimal transfer} and consistently improves expected
robustness.

Abstract: The Entropic Optimal Transport (EOT) problem and its dynamic counterpart, the
Schr\"odinger bridge (SB) problem, play an important role in modern machine
learning, linking generative modeling with optimal transport theory. While
recent advances in discrete diffusion and flow models have sparked growing
interest in applying SB methods to discrete domains, there is still no reliable
way to evaluate how well these methods actually solve the underlying problem.
We address this challenge by introducing a benchmark for SB on discrete spaces.
Our construction yields pairs of probability distributions with analytically
known SB solutions, enabling rigorous evaluation. As a byproduct of building
this benchmark, we obtain two new SB algorithms, DLightSB and DLightSB-M, and
additionally extend prior related work to construct the $\alpha$-CSBM
algorithm. We demonstrate the utility of our benchmark by evaluating both
existing and new solvers in high-dimensional discrete settings. This work
provides the first step toward proper evaluation of SB methods on discrete
spaces, paving the way for more reproducible future studies.

Conclusion: 该方法为生成和设计应用提供了实用的优化框架，通过链接函数和扩散模型技术成功解决了隐式流形上的黎曼优化问题。

Abstract: Under the data manifold hypothesis, high-dimensional data are concentrated
near a low-dimensional manifold. We study the problem of Riemannian
optimization over such manifolds when they are given only implicitly through
the data distribution, and the standard manifold operations required by
classical algorithms are unavailable. This formulation captures a broad class
of data-driven design problems that are central to modern generative AI. Our
key idea is to introduce a link function that connects the data distribution to
the geometric operations needed for optimization. We show that this function
enables the recovery of essential manifold operations, such as retraction and
Riemannian gradient computation. Moreover, we establish a direct connection
between our construction and the score function in diffusion models of the data
distribution. This connection allows us to leverage well-studied
parameterizations, efficient training procedures, and even pretrained score
networks from the diffusion model literature to perform optimization. Building
on this foundation, we propose two efficient inference-time algorithms --
Denoising Landing Flow (DLF) and Denoising Riemannian Gradient Descent (DRGD)
-- and provide theoretical guarantees for both feasibility (approximate
manifold adherence) and optimality (small Riemannian gradient norm). Finally,
we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on finite-horizon reference
tracking tasks in data-driven control, highlighting its potential for practical
generative and design applications.

Motivation: 虽然已有研究表明连续思维链能通过隐式并行思维提升大语言模型的推理能力，但叠加机制如何从梯度训练中自然学习仍不清楚。

Method: 理论分析简化双层transformer在有向图可达性问题上的训练动态，追踪索引匹配logit的变化，并通过实验验证理论。

Result: 分析发现索引匹配logit在训练中先增后保持有界，有效平衡探索与利用，使模型在不确定时对多个搜索轨迹赋予相近权重，形成叠加。

Conclusion: 连续思维链训练过程中，有界的索引匹配logit促使模型自然学习叠加机制，在利用局部结构的同时保持对多个推理路径的探索能力。

Abstract: Previous work shows that the chain of continuous thought (continuous CoT)
improves the reasoning capability of large language models (LLMs) by enabling
implicit parallel thinking, and a subsequent work provided theoretical insight
by showing that a two-layer transformer equipped with continuous CoT can
efficiently solve directed graph reachability by maintaining a superposition of
multiple reasoning traces in the continuous thought. However, it remains
unclear how the superposition mechanism is naturally learned from
gradient-based training methods. To fill this gap, we theoretically analyze the
training dynamics of a simplified two-layer transformer on the directed graph
reachability problem to unveil how the superposition mechanism emerges during
training in two training stages -- (i) a thought-generation stage that
autoregressively expands the continuous thought, and (ii) a prediction stage
that converts the thought into the final answer. Our analysis reveals that
during training using continuous thought, the index-matching logit, an
important quantity which reflects the strength of the model's local search
ability, will first increase and then remain bounded under mild assumptions.
The bounded index-matching logit effectively balances exploration and
exploitation during the reasoning process: the model will exploit local problem
structures to identify plausible search traces, and assign comparable weights
to multiple such traces to explore when it is uncertain about which solution is
correct, which results in superposition. Our experimental results tracking the
growth of logits further validate our theory.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文提出了基于Kolmogorov-Arnold网络(KANs)的特征选择方法，通过四种KAN选择器与经典基线方法比较，在表格数据集上显示出竞争性甚至更优的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高维数据集需要有效的特征选择来提高预测性能、可解释性和鲁棒性。传统方法在处理非线性特征关系方面存在局限。

Method: 提出了四种KAN-based特征选择器(KAN-L1, KAN-L2, KAN-SI, KAN-KO)，使用样条参数化特征变换，并与LASSO、随机森林、互信息、SVM-RFE等经典方法在多个分类和回归数据集上进行比较。

Result: KAN选择器在结构化数据集和合成数据集上与经典基线方法竞争甚至更优。KAN-L2和KAN-SI在噪声回归数据集上表现稳健，KAN-L1、KAN-KO和KAN-SI在分类任务中有时优于其他选择器。

Conclusion: 基于KAN的特征选择为传统方法提供了强大且可解释的替代方案，能够发现超越稀疏性或基于不纯度测量的非线性和多变量特征相关性。

Abstract: High-dimensional datasets require effective feature selection to improve
predictive performance, interpretability, and robustness. We propose and
evaluate feature selection methods for tabular datasets based on
Kolmogorov-Arnold networks (KANs), which parameterize feature transformations
through splines, enabling direct access to interpretable importance measures.
We introduce four KAN-based selectors ($\textit{KAN-L1}$, $\textit{KAN-L2}$,
$\textit{KAN-SI}$, $\textit{KAN-KO}$) and compare them against classical
baselines (LASSO, Random Forest, Mutual Information, SVM-RFE) across multiple
classification and regression tabular dataset benchmarks. Average (over three
retention levels: 20\%, 40\%, and 60\%) F1 scores and $R^2$ score results
reveal that KAN-based selectors, particularly $\textit{KAN-L2}$,
$\textit{KAN-L1}$, $\textit{KAN-SI}$, and $\textit{KAN-KO}$, are competitive
with and sometimes superior to classical baselines in structured and synthetic
datasets. However, $\textit{KAN-L1}$ is often too aggressive in regression,
removing useful features, while $\textit{KAN-L2}$ underperforms in
classification, where simple coefficient shrinkage misses complex feature
interactions. $\textit{KAN-L2}$ and $\textit{KAN-SI}$ provide robust
performance on noisy regression datasets and heterogeneous datasets, aligning
closely with ensemble predictors. In classification tasks, KAN selectors such
as $\textit{KAN-L1}$, $\textit{KAN-KO}$, and $\textit{KAN-SI}$ sometimes
surpass the other selectors by eliminating redundancy, particularly in
high-dimensional multi-class data. Overall, our findings demonstrate that
KAN-based feature selection provides a powerful and interpretable alternative
to traditional methods, capable of uncovering nonlinear and multivariate
feature relevance beyond sparsity or impurity-based measures.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度网络学习到的丰富表示常包含与模型预测语义矛盾的噪声类间相似性，需要提升特征表示的语义质量。

Method: 在任意深度引入参数自由的图一致性层(GCL)，构建批次级特征相似图并与全局类感知掩码预测图对齐，通过自适应权重学习层重要性。

Result: GCR促进了更清晰的特征结构、更强的类内凝聚力和改进的泛化能力，在各种网络和数据集上均有效。

Conclusion: GCR提供了一种从预测结构学习的新视角，是模型无关、轻量级的方法，能增强语义结构而不改变架构或训练过程。

Abstract: We propose Graph Consistency Regularization (GCR), a novel framework that
injects relational graph structures, derived from model predictions, into the
learning process to promote class-aware, semantically meaningful feature
representations. Functioning as a form of self-prompting, GCR enables the model
to refine its internal structure using its own outputs. While deep networks
learn rich representations, these often capture noisy inter-class similarities
that contradict the model's predicted semantics. GCR addresses this issue by
introducing parameter-free Graph Consistency Layers (GCLs) at arbitrary depths.
Each GCL builds a batch-level feature similarity graph and aligns it with a
global, class-aware masked prediction graph, derived by modulating softmax
prediction similarities with intra-class indicators. This alignment enforces
that feature-level relationships reflect class-consistent prediction behavior,
acting as a semantic regularizer throughout the network. Unlike prior work, GCR
introduces a multi-layer, cross-space graph alignment mechanism with adaptive
weighting, where layer importance is learned from graph discrepancy magnitudes.
This allows the model to prioritize semantically reliable layers and suppress
noisy ones, enhancing feature quality without modifying the architecture or
training procedure. GCR is model-agnostic, lightweight, and improves semantic
structure across various networks and datasets. Experiments show that GCR
promotes cleaner feature structure, stronger intra-class cohesion, and improved
generalization, offering a new perspective on learning from prediction
structure. [Project website](https://darcyddx.github.io/gcr/)

<details>

Motivation: 扩散语言模型通过灵活的并行生成路径实现快速推理，但规划器修改了反向路径，导致训练时的均匀随机去噪路径与推理时的规划路径不匹配。

Method: 推导了新的规划证据下界(P-ELBO)，并提出Planner Aware Path Learning (PAPL)方法，修改标准掩码离散扩散损失以在规划去噪器下对齐训练和推理。

Result: PAPL在不同领域带来一致改进：蛋白质序列建模相对提升40%，文本生成MAUVE指标提升高达4倍，代码生成HumanEval pass@10相对提升23%。

Conclusion: 通过将规划器纳入训练目标，PAPL有效解决了扩散模型中训练-推理不匹配问题，显著提升了多个领域的生成性能。

Abstract: Diffusion language models have emerged as a powerful alternative to
autoregressive models, enabling fast inference through flexible and parallel
generation paths. This flexibility is enabled by new sampling strategies, or
planners, that iteratively choose where to denoise along the sequence rather
than sampling uniformly at random. However, by modifying reverse paths,
planners introduce a mismatch between the uniformly random denoising paths used
during training and the planning-based paths used at inference. In this work,
we systematically investigate this mismatch and theoretically show that the
standard discrete diffusion training evidence lower bound (ELBO) does not
accurately describe a denoiser under non-uniform planning. To bridge this gap,
we derive a new Planned Evidence Lower Bound (P-ELBO) that directly
incorporates planner-based reverse dynamics into the training objective.
Building on this, we propose Planner Aware Path Learning (PAPL), a simple and
effective modification of the standard masked discrete diffusion loss that
aligns training and inference under planned denoisers. Empirically, PAPL
delivers consistent improvements across domains, including a 40% relative gain
in protein sequence modeling, up to a 4x improvement in MAUVE for text
generation, and a 23% relative gain in HumanEval pass@10 for code generation.

Result: 在六个公共多路数据集上的实验显示，相比强基线方法（MELL、HOPLP-MUL、RMNE）获得了持续的macro-F1提升。

Conclusion: 该方法简单、可扩展，且兼容预计算嵌入和GNN编码器。

Abstract: Multiplex graphs capture diverse relations among shared nodes. Most
predictors either collapse layers or treat them independently. This loses
crucial inter-layer dependencies and struggles with scalability. To overcome
this, we frame multiplex link prediction as multi-view edge classification. For
each node pair, we construct a sequence of per-layer edge views and apply
cross-layer self-attention to fuse evidence for the target layer. We present
two models as instances of this framework: Trans-SLE, a lightweight transformer
over static embeddings, and Trans-GAT, which combines layer-specific GAT
encoders with transformer fusion. To ensure scalability and fairness, we
introduce a Union--Set candidate pool and two leakage-free protocols:
cross-layer and inductive subgraph generalization. Experiments on six public
multiplex datasets show consistent macro-F_1 gains over strong baselines (MELL,
HOPLP-MUL, RMNE). Our approach is simple, scalable, and compatible with both
precomputed embeddings and GNN encoders.

Conclusion: URS是第一个能够使用单一模型处理超过100种VRP变体的神经求解器，实现了显著的零样本泛化能力。

Abstract: Multi-task neural routing solvers have emerged as a promising paradigm for
their ability to solve multiple vehicle routing problems (VRPs) using a single
model. However, existing neural solvers typically rely on predefined problem
constraints or require per-problem fine-tuning, which substantially limits
their zero-shot generalization ability to unseen VRP variants. To address this
critical bottleneck, we propose URS, a unified neural routing solver capable of
zero-shot generalization across a wide range of unseen VRPs using a single
model without any fine-tuning. The key component of URS is the unified data
representation (UDR), which replaces problem enumeration with data unification,
thereby broadening the problem coverage and reducing reliance on domain
expertise. In addition, we propose a Mixed Bias Module (MBM) to efficiently
learn the geometric and relational biases inherent in various problems. On top
of the proposed UDR, we further develop a parameter generator that adaptively
adjusts the decoder and bias weights of MBM to enhance zero-shot
generalization. Moreover, we propose an LLM-driven constraint satisfaction
mechanism, which translates raw problem descriptions into executable stepwise
masking functions to ensure solution feasibility. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that URS can consistently produce high-quality solutions for more
than 100 distinct VRP variants without any fine-tuning, which includes more
than 90 unseen variants. To the best of our knowledge, URS is the first neural
solver capable of handling over 100 VRP variants with a single model.

TL;DR: LOTFormer是一种同时具有线性时间复杂度和双重随机性的注意力机制，通过将注意力映射建模为查询和键之间的传输计划，并使用低秩条件传输来平衡令牌参与度，在长序列处理中实现了高效且鲁棒的注意力计算。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准softmax注意力机制的二次复杂度限制了Transformer在长上下文窗口中的扩展，而现有的线性注意力方法虽然解决了计算复杂度问题，但注意力映射的行归一化特性可能导致过度关注少数令牌，降低鲁棒性和信息流动。双重随机注意力可以平衡令牌参与度，但现有方法通常引入显著开销，影响可扩展性。

Method: 将注意力映射建模为查询和键之间的传输计划，通过约束传输计划为低秩来实现线性时间计算。具体方法包括：1）学习一个具有小支撑的可学习枢轴度量；2）求解两个熵最优传输问题（查询→枢轴和枢轴→键）；3）将它们组合成条件耦合，生成秩最多为r≪n的注意力矩阵，时间复杂度为O(nr)。

Result: 在Long Range Arena基准测试中，LOTFormer实现了最先进的结果，在准确性和效率方面均超越了先前的线性和基于传输的注意力方法。

Conclusion: LOTFormer提供了一种原则性的注意力机制，同时实现了线性时间复杂度和双重随机性，有效平衡了计算效率和注意力质量，为长序列处理提供了高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Transformers have proven highly effective across a wide range of modalities.
However, the quadratic complexity of the standard softmax attention mechanism
poses a fundamental barrier to scaling them to long context windows. A large
body of work addresses this with linear attention, which reformulates attention
as a kernel function and approximates it with finite feature maps to achieve
linear-time computation. Orthogonal to computational scaling, most attention
mechanisms -- both quadratic and linear -- produce row-normalized maps that can
over-focus on a few tokens, degrading robustness and information flow.
Enforcing doubly-stochastic attention alleviates this by balancing token
participation across rows and columns, but existing doubly-stochastic attention
mechanisms typically introduce substantial overhead, undermining scalability.
We propose LOTFormer, a principled attention mechanism that is simultaneously
linear-time and doubly-stochastic. Our approach exploits the connection between
attention maps and transportation plans between query and key measures. The
central idea is to constrain the transport plan to be low-rank by conditioning
it on a learnable pivot measure with small support. Concretely, we solve two
entropic optimal transport problems (queries $\to$ pivot and pivot $\to$ keys)
and compose them into a conditional (glued) coupling. This yields an attention
matrix that is provably doubly-stochastic, has rank at most $r \ll n$, and
applies to values in $O(nr)$ time without forming the full $n \times n$ map.
The pivot locations and masses are learned end-to-end. Empirically, LOTFormer
achieves state-of-the-art results on the Long Range Arena benchmark, surpassing
prior linear and transport-based attention methods in both accuracy and
efficiency.

Motivation: 影响函数虽然能追溯模型预测到训练数据，但在深度学习中的实际应用受到大尺度、病态Hessian矩阵求逆的阻碍。现有近似方法如GGN和K-FAC的精确度对数据归因性能的影响尚不明确。

Method: 在受控分类设置下，研究Hessian近似质量对影响函数归因的影响，分解最近Hessian近似方法的各个步骤并评估每个步骤对归因准确性的影响。

Result: 实验表明更好的Hessian近似一致地产生更好的影响分数质量。K-FAC特征值与GGN/EK-FAC特征值之间的不匹配是主要误差来源。

Conclusion: 研究结果为改进Hessian近似的研究努力提供了合理性，并指明了哪些近似步骤对归因准确性最为关键，有助于在计算可行性和归因准确性之间找到平衡。

Abstract: Influence functions offer a principled way to trace model predictions back to
training data, but their use in deep learning is hampered by the need to invert
a large, ill-conditioned Hessian matrix. Approximations such as Generalised
Gauss-Newton (GGN) and Kronecker-Factored Approximate Curvature (K-FAC) have
been proposed to make influence computation tractable, yet it remains unclear
how the departure from exactness impacts data attribution performance.
Critically, given the restricted regime in which influence functions are
derived, it is not necessarily clear better Hessian approximations should even
lead to better data attribution performance. In this paper, we investigate the
effect of Hessian approximation quality on influence-function attributions in a
controlled classification setting. Our experiments show that better Hessian
approximations consistently yield better influence score quality, offering
justification for recent research efforts towards that end. We further
decompose the approximation steps for recent Hessian approximation methods and
evaluate each step's influence on attribution accuracy. Notably, the mismatch
between K-FAC eigenvalues and GGN/EK-FAC eigenvalues accounts for the majority
of the error and influence loss. These findings highlight which approximations
are most critical, guiding future efforts to balance computational tractability
and attribution accuracy.

necessitates sensitive data removal in model training, yet this process often
induces distributional shifts that undermine model performance-particularly in
out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios. We propose a novel data removal approach
that enhances deep predictive models through factor decorrelation and loss
perturbation. Our approach introduces: (1) a discriminative-preserving factor
decorrelation module employing dynamic adaptive weight adjustment and iterative
representation updating to reduce feature redundancy and minimize inter-feature
correlations. (2) a smoothed data removal mechanism with loss perturbation that
creates information-theoretic safeguards against data leakage during removal
operations. Extensive experiments on five benchmark datasets show that our
approach outperforms other baselines and consistently achieves high predictive
accuracy and robustness even under significant distribution shifts. The results
highlight its superior efficiency and adaptability in both in-distribution and
out-of-distribution scenarios.

*Dawei Gao,Dali Wang,Zhuowei Gu,Qinglei Cao,Xiao Wang,Peter Thornton,Dan Ricciuto,Yunhe Feng*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PHASE是一个模块化深度学习框架，通过物理集成和异构数据融合，将地球系统模型中的生物地球化学自旋过程从1200年加速到20年，实现60倍加速。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模数值模拟计算成本高昂，现有AI替代模型在关键任务应用中存在物理合理性、可信度和异构数据融合的局限性。

Method: PHASE框架结合了异构输入的数据类型感知编码器和多级物理约束，从局部动力学到全局系统行为保持一致性。

Result: 在E3SM陆地模型中，仅使用前20年模拟数据就能推断出原本需要1200年才能达到的近平衡状态，有效减少积分长度至少60倍。

Conclusion: PHASE能够捕捉控制物理规律而非表面相关性，为陆地表面建模和其他复杂科学工作流程提供实用、物理一致的加速解决方案。

Abstract: Large-scale numerical simulations underpin modern scientific discovery but
remain constrained by prohibitive computational costs. AI surrogates offer
acceleration, yet adoption in mission-critical settings is limited by concerns
over physical plausibility, trustworthiness, and the fusion of heterogeneous
data. We introduce PHASE, a modular deep-learning framework for
physics-integrated, heterogeneity-aware surrogates in scientific simulations.
PHASE combines data-type-aware encoders for heterogeneous inputs with
multi-level physics-based constraints that promote consistency from local
dynamics to global system behavior. We validate PHASE on the biogeochemical
(BGC) spin-up workflow of the U.S. Department of Energy's Energy Exascale Earth
System Model (E3SM) Land Model (ELM), presenting-to our knowledge-the first
scientifically validated AI-accelerated solution for this task. Using only the
first 20 simulation years, PHASE infers a near-equilibrium state that otherwise
requires more than 1,200 years of integration, yielding an effective reduction
in required integration length by at least 60x. The framework is enabled by a
pipeline for fusing heterogeneous scientific data and demonstrates strong
generalization to higher spatial resolutions with minimal fine-tuning. These
results indicate that PHASE captures governing physical regularities rather
than surface correlations, enabling practical, physically consistent
acceleration of land-surface modeling and other complex scientific workflows.

TL;DR: 提出Evolved Sampling (ES)框架，通过动态采样和损失差异分析实现高效数据选择，在保持模型性能的同时显著加速训练过程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 数据选择旨在加速学习同时保持性能，核心思想是识别对训练有显著贡献的信息数据样本。

Method: 基于损失动态和增强损失差异进行批级数据选择，支持灵活的频率调整，并可扩展为结合集合级数据选择的ESWP方法。

Result: 作为即插即用框架，ES(WP)在各种预训练和后训练任务中实现无损训练加速，节省高达近45%的挂钟时间。

Conclusion: 研究结果激励对现代大规模机器学习数据效率方面的进一步探索。

Abstract: Data selection is designed to accelerate learning with preserved performance.
To achieve this, a fundamental thought is to identify informative data samples
with significant contributions to the training. In this work, we propose
\textbf{Evolved Sampling} (\textbf{ES}), a simple yet effective framework for
\emph{dynamic} sampling along the training process. This method conducts \em
batch \em level data selection based on the dynamics of losses and augmented
\emph{loss differences}, which enables flexible \emph{frequency tuning}, and
hence significantly reduces the back propagation time with maintained model
performance. Due to its conciseness, ES is also readily extensible to
incorporate \em set \em level data selection (to form ES with pruning,
\textbf{ESWP}) for further accelerations. As a plug-and-play framework, ES(WP)
consistently achieves lossless training accelerations across various
pre-training and post-training tasks, saving up to nearly 45\% wall-clock time.
Our results motivate further investigations on the data efficiency aspect of
modern large-scale machine learning.

TL;DR: GEMS是一个替代PSRO的可扩展多智能体强化学习框架，使用潜在锚点和单个生成器取代显式策略种群，通过蒙特卡洛推演和元动态实现更高效的学习。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有基于种群的MARL方法（如PSRO）在计算和内存上的二次方和线性成本问题，实现更可扩展的多智能体学习。

Method: 使用紧凑的潜在锚点集和单个摊销生成器替代显式策略种群；采用无偏蒙特卡洛推演、乘法权重元动态和无模型经验伯恩斯坦UCB预言机自适应扩展策略集；在生成器内使用基于优势的信任域目标训练最佳响应。

Result: 在双人和多人游戏中，GEMS比PSRO快约6倍，内存使用减少1.3倍，同时获得更高奖励。

Conclusion: GEMS在保持PSRO博弈论保证的同时，克服了其基本低效问题，实现了多个领域的可扩展多智能体学习。

Abstract: Scalable multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) remains a central
challenge for AI. Existing population-based methods, like Policy-Space Response
Oracles, PSRO, require storing explicit policy populations and constructing
full payoff matrices, incurring quadratic computation and linear memory costs.
We present Generative Evolutionary Meta-Solver (GEMS), a surrogate-free
framework that replaces explicit populations with a compact set of latent
anchors and a single amortized generator. Instead of exhaustively constructing
the payoff matrix, GEMS relies on unbiased Monte Carlo rollouts,
multiplicative-weights meta-dynamics, and a model-free empirical-Bernstein UCB
oracle to adaptively expand the policy set. Best responses are trained within
the generator using an advantage-based trust-region objective, eliminating the
need to store and train separate actors. We evaluated GEMS in a variety of
Two-player and Multi-Player games such as the Deceptive Messages Game, Kuhn
Poker and Multi-Particle environment. We find that GEMS is up to ~6x faster,
has 1.3x less memory usage than PSRO, while also reaps higher rewards
simultaneously. These results demonstrate that GEMS retains the game theoretic
guarantees of PSRO, while overcoming its fundamental inefficiencies, hence
enabling scalable multi-agent learning in multiple domains.

TL;DR: 提出了一个名为POC的框架，用于在实时操作中决定何时重新求解MILP优化问题，平衡性能与计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 实时操作中需要反复求解计算密集的MILP问题，但何时重新求解是一个经济上重要的问题，现有方法主要关注启发式、低数据设置和平滑目标。

Method: 提出了POC框架，结合近端策略优化和变点检测，系统性地平衡性能与成本，并建立了重新求解次数与成本的理论关系。

Result: 在8个合成和真实数据集上测试，POC始终优于现有基线方法2%-17%。

Conclusion: POC框架有效解决了MILP重新求解时机问题，同时填补了实时MILP基准测试和评估标准的文献空白。

Abstract: A common challenge in real-time operations is deciding whether to re-solve an
optimization problem or continue using an existing solution. While modern data
platforms may collect information at high frequencies, many real-time
operations require repeatedly solving computationally intensive optimization
problems formulated as Mixed-Integer Linear Programs (MILPs). Determining when
to re-solve is, therefore, an economically important question. This problem
poses several challenges: 1) How to characterize solution optimality and
solving cost; 2) How to detect environmental changes and select beneficial
samples for solving the MILP; 3) Given the large time horizon and non-MDP
structure, vanilla reinforcement learning (RL) methods are not directly
applicable and tend to suffer from value function explosion. Existing
literature largely focuses on heuristics, low-data settings, and smooth
objectives, with little focus on common NP-hard MILPs. We propose a framework
called Proximal Policy Optimization with Change Point Detection (POC), which
systematically offers a solution for balancing performance and cost when
deciding appropriate re-solving times. Theoretically, we establish the
relationship between the number of re-solves and the re-solving cost. To test
our framework, we assemble eight synthetic and real-world datasets, and show
that POC consistently outperforms existing baselines by 2%-17%. As a side
benefit, our work fills the gap in the literature by introducing real-time MILP
benchmarks and evaluation criteria.

*Harshil Vejendla*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Drift-Adapter是一种轻量级可学习转换层，通过在旧版和新版嵌入空间之间建立映射，避免升级嵌入模型时重新编码整个语料库和重建ANN索引，显著降低操作中断和计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生产向量数据库中升级嵌入模型通常需要重新编码整个语料库并重建近似最近邻索引，这会导致显著的操作中断和计算成本。

Method: 设计了三种适配器参数化方法：正交Procrustes、低秩仿射和紧凑残差MLP，通过在少量成对新旧嵌入样本上训练，将新查询映射到旧版嵌入空间。

Result: 在MTEB文本语料和CLIP图像模型升级实验中，Drift-Adapter恢复了95-99%的检索召回率，查询延迟仅增加不到10微秒，相比完全重新索引减少100倍以上的重新计算成本。

Conclusion: Drift-Adapter作为一种实用解决方案，能够以接近零操作中断的方式促进敏捷模型部署，在模型漂移、训练数据规模和可扩展性方面表现出良好的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Upgrading embedding models in production vector databases typically requires
re-encoding the entire corpus and rebuilding the Approximate Nearest Neighbor
(ANN) index, leading to significant operational disruption and computational
cost. This paper presents Drift-Adapter, a lightweight, learnable
transformation layer designed to bridge embedding spaces between model
versions. By mapping new queries into the legacy embedding space, Drift-Adapter
enables the continued use of the existing ANN index, effectively deferring full
re-computation. We systematically evaluate three adapter parameterizations:
Orthogonal Procrustes, Low-Rank Affine, and a compact Residual MLP, trained on
a small sample of paired old and new embeddings. Experiments on MTEB text
corpora and a CLIP image model upgrade (1M items) show that Drift-Adapter
recovers 95-99% of the retrieval recall (Recall@10, MRR) of a full
re-embedding, adding less than 10 microseconds of query latency. Compared to
operational strategies like full re-indexing or dual-index serving,
Drift-Adapter reduces recompute costs by over 100 times and facilitates
upgrades with near-zero operational interruption. We analyze robustness to
varied model drift, training data size, scalability to billion-item systems,
and the impact of design choices like diagonal scaling, demonstrating
Drift-Adapter's viability as a pragmatic solution for agile model deployment.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为LoRAct的内存高效微调方法，通过低秩激活压缩显著减少内存消耗，在保持性能的同时比LoRA方法减少约80%的激活内存。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着基础模型的发展，参数高效微调范式受到广泛关注。虽然已有许多方法减少可训练参数数量，但其巨大的内存开销仍然是阻碍实际部署的关键瓶颈。作者观察到模型激活是内存消耗的主要来源，特别是在大批量和长上下文长度下，但激活的秩始终保持较低。

Method: 提出LoRAct方法，提供更灵活和通用的压缩策略，可以在前向传播过程中在线应用，无需任何校准数据。该方法包含一种专门为低秩矩阵设计的新型基于采样的正交分解算法，相比广泛使用的RSVD具有更好的计算效率和更紧的误差界。

Result: 在视觉和语言任务上的实验证明了LoRAct的有效性。值得注意的是，与广泛采用的LoRA方法相比，LoRAct进一步减少了约80%的激活内存，同时保持竞争性能。

Conclusion: LoRAct是一种有效的内存高效微调方法，通过低秩激活压缩解决了参数高效微调中的内存瓶颈问题，为实际部署提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: The parameter-efficient fine-tuning paradigm has garnered significant
attention with the advancement of foundation models. Although numerous methods
have been proposed to reduce the number of trainable parameters, their
substantial memory overhead remains a critical bottleneck that hinders
practical deployment. In this paper, we observe that model activations
constitute a major source of memory consumption, especially under large batch
sizes and long context lengths; however, the rank of the activations remains
consistently low. Motivated by this insight, we propose a memory-efficient
fine-tuning approach Low-Rank Activation Compression (LoRAct). Unlike prior
work, LoRAct provides a more flexible and versatile compressing strategy that
can be applied online during the forward pass without the need for any
calibration data. Moreover, LoRAct incorporates a novel sampling-based
orthogonal decomposition algorithm specifically designed for low-rank matrices,
offering improved computational efficiency and a tighter error bound compared
to the widely used RSVD. Experiments on both vision and language tasks
demonstrate the effectiveness of LoRAct. Notably, LoRAct further reduces
activation memory by approximately 80% in comparison with the widely adopted
LoRA method, while maintaining competitive performance. The source code is

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究群不变神经网络在对称函数学习中的理论优势，为编码对称结构提供严格的理论基础。

Method: 在Barron框架下分析群不变神经网络的逼近误差和Rademacher复杂度，引入群依赖因子δ来量化对称性带来的改进。

Result: 群不变结构引入δ≤1因子，当δ较小时能显著提升逼近精度；Rademacher复杂度不高于非不变网络，估计误差不受影响；泛化误差在对称函数学习中显著改善。

Conclusion: 编码群不变结构能为对称目标函数带来明确的统计优势，理论分析为对称性在神经网络中的应用提供了坚实基础。

Abstract: We investigate the generalization error of group-invariant neural networks
within the Barron framework. Our analysis shows that incorporating
group-invariant structures introduces a group-dependent factor
$\delta_{G,\Gamma,\sigma} \le 1$ into the approximation rate. When this factor
is small, group invariance yields substantial improvements in approximation
accuracy. On the estimation side, we establish that the Rademacher complexity
of the group-invariant class is no larger than that of the non-invariant
counterpart, implying that the estimation error remains unaffected by the
incorporation of symmetry. Consequently, the generalization error can improve
significantly when learning functions with inherent group symmetries. We
further provide illustrative examples demonstrating both favorable cases, where
$\delta_{G,\Gamma,\sigma}\approx |G|^{-1}$, and unfavorable ones, where
$\delta_{G,\Gamma,\sigma}\approx 1$. Overall, our results offer a rigorous
theoretical foundation showing that encoding group-invariant structures in
neural networks leads to clear statistical advantages for symmetric target
functions.

Motivation: 机器学习模型在分布偏移下性能下降，研究是否仅依靠过去数据就能实现对未来数据的泛化。

Method: 探索两种方法：参数插值（过去模型参数的凸组合）和参数外推（超出过去参数凸包的外推），并在语言建模、新闻摘要、图像分类等时序任务上进行基准测试。

Result: 所有评估方法都无法在所有场景中一致优于简单使用最新模型参数的基线方法。

Conclusion: 在没有未来数据或对数据生成过程的强假设时，泛化和外推到未来数据存在固有困难，需要谨慎评估此类泛化声明。

Abstract: Machine learning (ML) models often struggle to maintain performance under
distribution shifts, leading to inaccurate predictions on unseen future data.
In this work, we investigate whether and under what conditions models can
achieve such a generalization when relying solely on past data. We explore two
primary approaches: convex combinations of past model parameters
(\emph{parameter interpolation}) and explicit extrapolation beyond the convex
hull of past parameters (\emph{parameter extrapolation}). We benchmark several
methods within these categories on a diverse set of temporal tasks, including
language modeling, news summarization, news tag prediction, academic paper
categorization, satellite image-based land use classification over time, and
historical yearbook photo gender prediction. Our empirical findings show that
none of the evaluated methods consistently outperforms the simple baseline of
using the latest available model parameters in all scenarios. In the absence of
access to future data or robust assumptions about the underlying
data-generating process, these results underscore the inherent difficulties of
generalizing and extrapolating to future data and warrant caution when
evaluating claims of such generalization.

Result: 在四个真实数据集上的综合实验证明CRIB的有效性，即使在高缺失率下也能准确预测

Conclusion: CRIB通过直接从不完整时间序列预测，避免了插值误差，为MTSF-M问题提供了更可靠的解决方案

Abstract: Missing values are common in real-world time series, and multivariate time
series forecasting with missing values (MTSF-M) has become a crucial area of
research for ensuring reliable predictions. To address the challenge of missing
data, current approaches have developed an imputation-then-prediction framework
that uses imputation modules to fill in missing values, followed by forecasting
on the imputed data. However, this framework overlooks a critical issue: there
is no ground truth for the missing values, making the imputation process
susceptible to errors that can degrade prediction accuracy. In this paper, we
conduct a systematic empirical study and reveal that imputation without direct
supervision can corrupt the underlying data distribution and actively degrade
prediction accuracy. To address this, we propose a paradigm shift that moves
away from imputation and directly predicts from the partially observed time
series. We introduce Consistency-Regularized Information Bottleneck (CRIB), a
novel framework built on the Information Bottleneck principle. CRIB combines a
unified-variate attention mechanism with a consistency regularization scheme to
learn robust representations that filter out noise introduced by missing values
while preserving essential predictive signals. Comprehensive experiments on
four real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of CRIB, which predicts
accurately even under high missing rates. Our code is available in
https://github.com/Muyiiiii/CRIB.

Motivation: 随着新优化器的普及和模型量化成为高效部署的标准，需要系统研究优化器选择如何影响量化后的模型性能。

Method: 训练50M到1.5B参数的全精度模型，使用六种优化器建立基准，然后应用后训练量化和量化感知训练评估性能下降。

Result: 发现与异常值相关的指标无法预测不同优化器的PTQ性能；在QAT中，Shampoo优化器显示出最低的精度下降和最高的参数效率。

Conclusion: 优化器选择显著影响量化模型性能，Shampoo在量化感知训练中表现最优，为高效模型部署提供了重要指导。

Abstract: As new optimizers gain traction and model quantization becomes standard for
efficient deployment, a key question arises: how does the choice of optimizer
affect model performance in the presence of quantization? Despite progress in
both areas, systematic evidence on optimizer-quantization interactions remains
limited. To fill this gap, we study the impact of optimizer choice on model
robustness under quantization, considering both post-training quantization
(PTQ), and quantization-aware training (QAT). We first train full-precision
models, ranging from 50M to 1.5B parameters, with six optimizers, to explore
the hyperparameter landscape, and establish well-tuned baselines. We then apply
PTQ to evaluate how model performance degrades when trained with different
optimizers. We find that outlier-related metrics, such as the max-to-mean ratio
(MMR) and Kurtosis, fail to predict the PTQ performance across different
optimizers. We show analytically that this is due to the MMR capturing only
isolated layer errors, while ignoring how quantization errors accumulate and
propagate through the network. To study the QAT degradation, we train quantized
models from scratch and compare them to our original-precision baselines. We
find that optimizers performing well in the original pretraining setup may not
remain optimal under QAT, and that models trained with Shampoo show the lowest
accuracy degradation. Finally, we derive scaling laws for quantization-aware
training under different optimizers, showing that Shampoo achieves the highest
parameter efficiency of all tested optimizers.

Motivation: 现有多模态生成模型在处理异构数据和模态间关联时，难以有效分离共享和私有信息，特别是在复杂数据集上。

Method: 使用互信息正则化（跨视图互信息最大化和循环一致性损失）提取共享变量并去除冗余，结合扩散模型增强先验分布能力。

Result: IDMVAE在挑战性数据集上实现了共享与私有信息的清晰分离，表现出优越的生成质量和语义一致性。

Conclusion: 所提出的组件相互补充，IDMVAE在多模态表示学习中优于现有方法，实现了更好的信息解耦。

Abstract: Multimodal data are prevalent across various domains, and learning robust
representations of such data is paramount to enhancing generation quality and
downstream task performance. To handle heterogeneity and interconnections among
different modalities, recent multimodal generative models extract shared and
private (modality-specific) information with two separate variables. Despite
attempts to enforce disentanglement between these two variables, these methods
struggle with challenging datasets where the likelihood model is insufficient.
In this paper, we propose Information-disentangled Multimodal VAE (IDMVAE) to
explicitly address this issue, with rigorous mutual information-based
regularizations, including cross-view mutual information maximization for
extracting shared variables, and a cycle-consistency style loss for redundancy
removal using generative augmentations. We further introduce diffusion models
to improve the capacity of latent priors. These newly proposed components are
complementary to each other. Compared to existing approaches, IDMVAE shows a
clean separation between shared and private information, demonstrating superior
generation quality and semantic coherence on challenging datasets.

Result: 在809株E. coli菌株数据集上，对4种抗生素预测均表现优异，CIP的MCC达0.926，GEN的Macro F1-score达0.691，模型能正确聚焦于已知耐药基因。

Conclusion: 融合序列感知1D CNN和特征基XGBoost的集成方法克服了顺序无关或单独序列模型的局限性，创建了强大的抗生素耐药性预测框架。

Abstract: Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR) is a rapidly escalating global health crisis.
While genomic sequencing enables rapid prediction of resistance phenotypes,
current computational methods have limitations. Standard machine learning
models treat the genome as an unordered collection of features, ignoring the
sequential context of Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs). State-of-the-art
sequence models like Transformers are often too data-hungry and computationally
expensive for the moderately-sized datasets that are typical in this domain. To
address these challenges, we propose AMR-EnsembleNet, an ensemble framework
that synergistically combines sequence-based and feature-based learning. We
developed a lightweight, custom 1D Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to
efficiently learn predictive sequence motifs from high-dimensional SNP data.
This sequence-aware model was ensembled with an XGBoost model, a powerful
gradient boosting system adept at capturing complex, non-local feature
interactions. We trained and evaluated our framework on a benchmark dataset of
809 E. coli strains, predicting resistance across four antibiotics with varying
class imbalance. Our 1D CNN-XGBoost ensemble consistently achieved top-tier
performance across all the antibiotics, reaching a Matthews Correlation
Coefficient (MCC) of 0.926 for Ciprofloxacin (CIP) and the highest Macro
F1-score of 0.691 for the challenging Gentamicin (GEN) AMR prediction. We also
show that our model consistently focuses on SNPs within well-known AMR genes
like fusA and parC, confirming it learns the correct genetic signals for
resistance. Our work demonstrates that fusing a sequence-aware 1D CNN with a
feature-based XGBoost model creates a powerful ensemble, overcoming the
limitations of using either an order-agnostic or a standalone sequence model.

Motivation: 传统约束方法如PC在CI测试不完美时会产生级联错误，而现有LLM方法假设完美专家，不适用于易产生幻觉的LLM

Method: 使用混洗查询过滤LLM幻觉，从高置信度种子出发，采用置信度下降传播策略定向边，可与任何基于骨架的发现方法集成

Result: 在多个真实世界图上，MosaCD在最终图构建中比现有约束方法获得更高准确率

Conclusion: 通过改进初始种子可靠性和鲁棒传播策略，MosaCD显著提升了因果发现性能

Abstract: Learning causal structure from observational data is central to scientific
modeling and decision-making. Constraint-based methods aim to recover
conditional independence (CI) relations in a causal directed acyclic graph
(DAG). Classical approaches such as PC and subsequent methods orient
v-structures first and then propagate edge directions from these seeds,
assuming perfect CI tests and exhaustive search of separating subsets --
assumptions often violated in practice, leading to cascading errors in the
final graph. Recent work has explored using large language models (LLMs) as
experts, prompting sets of nodes for edge directions, and could augment edge
orientation when assumptions are not met. However, such methods implicitly
assume perfect experts, which is unrealistic for hallucination-prone LLMs. We
propose MosaCD, a causal discovery method that propagates edges from a
high-confidence set of seeds derived from both CI tests and LLM annotations. To
filter hallucinations, we introduce shuffled queries that exploit LLMs'
positional bias, retaining only high-confidence seeds. We then apply a novel
confidence-down propagation strategy that orients the most reliable edges
first, and can be integrated with any skeleton-based discovery method. Across
multiple real-world graphs, MosaCD achieves higher accuracy in final graph
construction than existing constraint-based methods, largely due to the
improved reliability of initial seeds and robust propagation strategies.

Method: 引入EVO-LRP方法，应用协方差矩阵自适应进化策略(CMA-ES)来基于定量可解释性指标（如忠实度或稀疏性）调整LRP超参数。

Result: EVO-LRP在可解释性指标性能和视觉一致性方面优于传统XAI方法，对类别特定特征表现出强敏感性。

Conclusion: 通过原则性的任务特定优化，可以系统性地提高归因质量。

Abstract: Explainable AI (XAI) methods help identify which image regions influence a
model's prediction, but often face a trade-off between detail and
interpretability. Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP) offers a model-aware
alternative. However, LRP implementations commonly rely on heuristic rule sets
that are not optimized for clarity or alignment with model behavior. We
introduce EVO-LRP, a method that applies Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution
Strategy (CMA-ES) to tune LRP hyperparameters based on quantitative
interpretability metrics, such as faithfulness or sparseness. EVO-LRP
outperforms traditional XAI approaches in both interpretability metric
performance and visual coherence, with strong sensitivity to class-specific
features. These findings demonstrate that attribution quality can be
systematically improved through principled, task-specific optimization.

### [135] [Sketching Low-Rank Plus Diagonal Matrices](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23587)
*Andres Fernandez,Felix Dangel,Philipp Hennig,Frank Schneider*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SKETCHLORD方法同时估计低秩和对角分量，针对低秩加对角线性算子，比顺序估计方法更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 许多机器学习任务涉及高维线性算子，只能通过昂贵的矩阵向量乘积访问。现有方法只能构造低秩或对角近似，但实际算子可能同时包含这两种结构。

Method: 将SKETCHLORD建模为凸优化问题，开发可扩展算法，同时估计低秩和对角分量。

Result: 理论和实验证明联合估计优于任何顺序变体，在合成数据上准确恢复结构。

Conclusion: SKETCHLORD是高保真近似大规模算子（如深度学习Hessian）的有价值工具。

Abstract: Many relevant machine learning and scientific computing tasks involve
high-dimensional linear operators accessible only via costly matrix-vector
products. In this context, recent advances in sketched methods have enabled the
construction of *either* low-rank *or* diagonal approximations from few
matrix-vector products. This provides great speedup and scalability, but
approximation errors arise due to the assumed simpler structure. This work
introduces SKETCHLORD, a method that simultaneously estimates both low-rank
*and* diagonal components, targeting the broader class of Low-Rank *plus*
Diagonal (LoRD) linear operators. We demonstrate theoretically and empirically
that this joint estimation is superior also to any sequential variant
(diagonal-then-low-rank or low-rank-then-diagonal). Then, we cast SKETCHLORD as
a convex optimization problem, leading to a scalable algorithm. Comprehensive
experiments on synthetic (approximate) LoRD matrices confirm SKETCHLORD's
performance in accurately recovering these structures. This positions it as a
valuable addition to the structured approximation toolkit, particularly when
high-fidelity approximations are desired for large-scale operators, such as the
deep learning Hessian.

*Hoang Phan,Sungmin Cha,Tung Lam Tran,Qi Lei*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一个持续模型融合的整体框架，通过在融合前、融合中和融合后三个阶段进行干预，解决持续学习中的两个基本挑战，无需访问历史数据且保持恒定内存约束。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法要么维护不断增长的每领域任务向量列表导致可扩展性问题，要么仅依赖权重空间融合而丢失关键功能信息。

Method: 在切线空间中对主模型进行领域特定数据的微调以增强任务间权重解耦；在融合时利用优化器状态的功能信息；融合后进行表示差异校正。

Result: 在标准类增量和领域增量基准测试中实现了有竞争力的性能。

Conclusion: 该方法不仅实现了竞争性性能，还为灾难性遗忘问题提供了可扩展且高效的解决方案。

Abstract: We present a holistic framework for continual model merging that intervenes
at three critical stages: pre-merging, during merging, and post-merging-to
address two fundamental challenges in continual learning. In particular,
conventional approaches either maintain a growing list of per-domain task
vectors, leading to scalability issues or rely solely on weight-space merging
when old data is inaccessible, thereby losing crucial functional information.
Our method overcomes these limitations by first fine-tuning the main model
within its tangent space on domain-specific data; this linearization amplifies
per-task weight disentanglement, effectively mitigating across-task
interference. During merging, we leverage functional information from available
optimizer states beyond mere parameter averages to avoid the need to revisit
old data. Finally, a post-merging correction aligns the representation
discrepancy between pre- and post-merged models, reducing bias and enhancing
overall performance-all while operating under constant memory constraints
without accessing historical data. Extensive experiments on standard
class-incremental and domain-incremental benchmarks demonstrate that our
approach not only achieves competitive performance but also provides a scalable
and efficient solution to the catastrophic forgetting problem.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合重放和秩-1 EWC的持续学习方法，利用扩散模型在低信噪比下梯度共线性的特性，有效缓解灾难性遗忘问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决持续学习中的灾难性遗忘问题，现有方法如重放需要强生成器且易分布漂移，EWC假设任务间共享最优解且使用对角Fisher近似存在局限。

Method: 利用扩散模型在低信噪比下梯度共线性的特性，提出秩-1 EWC变体，结合重放方法鼓励参数共享并约束漂移。

Result: 在类别增量图像生成数据集上显著改善平均FID，减少遗忘，在MNIST和FashionMNIST上几乎消除遗忘，在ImageNet-1k上减少约一半遗忘。

Conclusion: 扩散模型具有近似秩-1的Fisher矩阵，结合重放和EWC能有效约束漂移，是持续学习的强有力方法。

Abstract: Catastrophic forgetting remains a central obstacle for continual learning in
neural models. Popular approaches -- replay and elastic weight consolidation
(EWC) -- have limitations: replay requires a strong generator and is prone to
distributional drift, while EWC implicitly assumes a shared optimum across
tasks and typically uses a diagonal Fisher approximation. In this work, we
study the gradient geometry of diffusion models, which can already produce
high-quality replay data. We provide theoretical and empirical evidence that,
in the low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regime, per-sample gradients become
strongly collinear, yielding an empirical Fisher that is effectively rank-1 and
aligned with the mean gradient. Leveraging this structure, we propose a rank-1
variant of EWC that is as cheap as the diagonal approximation yet captures the
dominant curvature direction. We pair this penalty with a replay-based approach
to encourage parameter sharing across tasks while mitigating drift. On
class-incremental image generation datasets (MNIST, FashionMNIST, CIFAR-10,
ImageNet-1k), our method consistently improves average FID and reduces
forgetting relative to replay-only and diagonal-EWC baselines. In particular,
forgetting is nearly eliminated on MNIST and FashionMNIST and is roughly halved
on ImageNet-1k. These results suggest that diffusion models admit an
approximately rank-1 Fisher. With a better Fisher estimate, EWC becomes a
strong complement to replay: replay encourages parameter sharing across tasks,
while EWC effectively constrains replay-induced drift.

Conclusion: 将线性系统的经典理论与现代学习技术相结合，有望构建鲁棒、可解释且数据高效的时间序列预测模型。

Abstract: Time series forecasting remains a critical challenge across numerous domains,
yet the effectiveness of complex models often varies unpredictably across
datasets. Recent studies highlight the surprising competitiveness of simple
linear models, suggesting that their robustness and interpretability warrant
deeper theoretical investigation. This paper presents a systematic study of
linear models for time series forecasting, with a focus on the role of
characteristic roots in temporal dynamics. We begin by analyzing the noise-free
setting, where we show that characteristic roots govern long-term behavior and
explain how design choices such as instance normalization and channel
independence affect model capabilities. We then extend our analysis to the
noisy regime, revealing that models tend to produce spurious roots. This leads
to the identification of a key data-scaling property: mitigating the influence
of noise requires disproportionately large training data, highlighting the need
for structural regularization. To address these challenges, we propose two
complementary strategies for robust root restructuring. The first uses rank
reduction techniques, including Reduced-Rank Regression and Direct Weight Rank
Reduction, to recover the low-dimensional latent dynamics. The second, a novel
adaptive method called Root Purge, encourages the model to learn a
noise-suppressing null space during training. Extensive experiments on standard
benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of both approaches, validating our
theoretical insights and achieving state-of-the-art results in several
settings. Our findings underscore the potential of integrating classical
theories for linear systems with modern learning techniques to build robust,
interpretable, and data-efficient forecasting models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 图神经网络通常假设类别分布平衡，但在实际图数据中存在类别不平衡问题，导致对少数类别的学习偏差和性能下降。研究发现合成节点存在质量不一致问题，需要解决这一挑战。

Method: GraphIFE框架结合图不变学习的两个关键概念，采用策略来增强嵌入空间表示，提高模型识别不变特征的能力。

Result: 大量实验表明GraphIFE框架具有高效性和鲁棒泛化能力，在多个数据集上持续优于各种基线方法。

Conclusion: GraphIFE框架能有效缓解图不平衡条件下的质量不一致问题，提升模型对少数类别的识别性能。

Abstract: The class imbalance problem refers to the disproportionate distribution of
samples across different classes within a dataset, where the minority classes
are significantly underrepresented. This issue is also prevalent in
graph-structured data. Most graph neural networks (GNNs) implicitly assume a
balanced class distribution and therefore often fail to account for the
challenges introduced by class imbalance, which can lead to biased learning and
degraded performance on minority classes. We identify a quality inconsistency
problem in synthesized nodes, which leads to suboptimal performance under graph
imbalance conditions. To mitigate this issue, we propose GraphIFE (Graph
Invariant Feature Extraction), a novel framework designed to mitigate quality
inconsistency in synthesized nodes. Our approach incorporates two key concepts
from graph invariant learning and introduces strategies to strengthen the
embedding space representation, thereby enhancing the model's ability to
identify invariant features. Extensive experiments demonstrate the framework's
efficiency and robust generalization, as GraphIFE consistently outperforms
various baselines across multiple datasets. The code is publicly available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统时空克里金法在训练评估中存在信息泄露问题，测试数据通过早停影响模型选择，无法准确反映分布外泛化特性。

Method: 采用3x3数据分割消除信息泄露，提出DRIK方法：扰动节点坐标捕捉连续空间关系、丢弃边减少信息流模糊性、添加伪标记子图增强领域泛化。

Result: 在六个时空数据集上的实验表明，DRIK始终优于现有方法，MAE降低达12.48%，同时保持强可扩展性。

Conclusion: DRIK通过改进的数据分割和多层面增强策略，显著提升了时空克里金法的分布外泛化性能。

Abstract: Inductive kriging supports high-resolution spatio-temporal estimation with
sparse sensor networks, but conventional training-evaluation setups often
suffer from information leakage and poor out-of-distribution (OOD)
generalization. We find that the common 2x2 spatio-temporal split allows test
data to influence model selection through early stopping, obscuring the true
OOD characteristics of inductive kriging. To address this issue, we propose a
3x3 partition that cleanly separates training, validation, and test sets,
eliminating leakage and better reflecting real-world applications. Building on
this redefined setting, we introduce DRIK, a Distribution-Robust Inductive
Kriging approach designed with the intrinsic properties of inductive kriging in
mind to explicitly enhance OOD generalization, employing a three-tier strategy
at the node, edge, and subgraph levels. DRIK perturbs node coordinates to
capture continuous spatial relationships, drops edges to reduce ambiguity in
information flow and increase topological diversity, and adds pseudo-labeled
subgraphs to strengthen domain generalization. Experiments on six diverse
spatio-temporal datasets show that DRIK consistently outperforms existing
methods, achieving up to 12.48% lower MAE while maintaining strong scalability.

Motivation: 现有异质图神经网络难以捕获长距离信息，需要堆叠多层导致计算复杂度高并出现过平滑问题。

Method: 引入虚拟节点作为辅助节点，与特定类型的所有节点相连，促进不同类型节点和边之间的长距离信息高效聚合。

Result: 在三个真实世界异质图数据集上的实验表明，VN-HGCN优于多个最先进的基线方法。

Conclusion: VN-HGCN是一个通用框架，可无缝应用于其他HGNN模型，展示了其泛化能力。

Abstract: Heterogeneous Graph Neural Networks (HGNNs) have exhibited powerful
performance in heterogeneous graph learning by aggregating information from
various types of nodes and edges. However, existing heterogeneous graph models
often struggle to capture long-range information or necessitate stacking
numerous layers to learn such dependencies, resulting in high computational
complexity and encountering over-smoothing issues. In this paper, we propose a
Virtual Nodes based Heterogeneous Graph Convolutional Network (VN-HGCN), which
leverages virtual nodes to facilitate enhanced information flow within the
graph. Virtual nodes are auxiliary nodes interconnected with all nodes of a
specific type in the graph, facilitating efficient aggregation of long-range
information across different types of nodes and edges. By incorporating virtual
nodes into the graph structure, VN-HGCN achieves effective information
aggregation with only $4$ layers. Additionally, we demonstrate that VN-HGCN can
serve as a versatile framework that can be seamlessly applied to other HGNN
models, showcasing its generalizability. Empirical evaluations validate the
effectiveness of VN-HGCN, and extensive experiments conducted on three
real-world heterogeneous graph datasets demonstrate the superiority of our
model over several state-of-the-art baselines.

Abstract: The problem of class imbalance refers to an uneven distribution of quantity
among classes in a dataset, where some classes are significantly
underrepresented compared to others. Class imbalance is also prevalent in
graph-structured data. Graph neural networks (GNNs) are typically based on the
assumption of class balance, often overlooking the issue of class imbalance. In
our investigation, we identified a problem, which we term the Randomness
Anomalous Connectivity Problem (RACP), where certain off-the-shelf models are
affected by random seeds, leading to a significant performance degradation. To
eliminate the influence of random factors in algorithms, we proposed PNS (Pure
Node Sampling) to address the RACP in the node synthesis stage. Unlike existing
approaches that design specialized algorithms to handle either quantity
imbalance or topological imbalance, PNS is a novel plug-and-play module that
operates directly during node synthesis to mitigate RACP. Moreover, PNS also
alleviates performance degradation caused by abnormal distribution of node
neighbors. We conduct a series of experiments to identify what factors are
influenced by random seeds. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness
and stability of our method, which not only eliminates the effect of
unfavorable random seeds but also outperforms the baseline across various
benchmark datasets with different GNN backbones. Data and code are available at

Abstract: Post-hoc calibration methods are widely used to improve the reliability of
probabilistic predictions from machine learning models. Despite their
prevalence, a comprehensive theoretical understanding of these methods remains
elusive, particularly regarding their performance across different datasets and
model architectures. Input features play a crucial role in shaping model
predictions and, consequently, their calibration. However, the interplay
between feature quality and calibration performance has not been thoroughly
investigated. In this work, we present a rigorous theoretical analysis of
post-hoc calibration methods, focusing on Platt scaling and isotonic
regression. We derive convergence guarantees, computational complexity bounds,
and finite-sample performance metrics for these methods. Furthermore, we
explore the impact of feature informativeness on calibration performance
through controlled synthetic experiments. Our empirical evaluation spans a
diverse set of real-world datasets and model architectures, demonstrating
consistent improvements in calibration metrics across various scenarios. By
examining calibration performance under varying feature conditions utilizing
only informative features versus complete feature spaces including noise
dimensions, we provide fundamental insights into the robustness and reliability
of different calibration approaches. Our findings offer practical guidelines
for selecting appropriate calibration methods based on dataset characteristics
and computational constraints, bridging the gap between theoretical
understanding and practical implementation in uncertainty quantification. Code

Conclusion: UAT框架能有效提升早退深度神经网络的鲁棒性和效率，在保持性能的同时显著降低计算成本。

Abstract: Early-Exit Deep Neural Networks enable adaptive inference by allowing
prediction at intermediary layers, significantly reducing computational costs
and latency. Most of the early exit strategies greedily exit a sample at an
intermediary layer if the confidence in class prediction exceeds a predefined
threshold that is set using a static validation set. This is problematic as the
model might be overconfident in a wrong class. Also, they are not robust to
distribution shifts encountered in deployment, which can undermine model
trustworthiness and accuracy. To address these challenges, we propose UAT that
adapts the threshold for exit decisions using a Multi-Armed Bandit framework,
enabling online, unsupervised adjustment of exit decisions. UAT makes decisions
based on a new reward function that assesses predictive certainty and its
reliability to balance computational efficiency and prediction quality while
penalizing unnecessary late exits. We provide guarantees on risk achieved by
UAT and validate its performance on diverse tasks spanning vision-language
understanding, text generation, and classification. Our framework demonstrates
consistent improvements in speedup (1.70-2.10x) with a minimal performance drop
(<2%) as compared to full model performance. Our source code is available at

TL;DR: 论文指出常见的知识蒸馏后对齐（KD -> Align）流程会削弱模型对齐罕见但期望行为的能力，提出应该先对齐后蒸馏（Align -> KD）才能有效保留参考模型的高召回特性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前效率导向的偏好对齐通常先在紧凑的知识蒸馏模型上进行，但这种方法忽视了参考模型的分布召回特性，导致无法有效对齐罕见但期望的行为。

Method: 1. 从理论上解释参考模型如何约束偏好对齐目标；2. 在可控的高斯混合实验中验证低召回锚定导致次优性能；3. 在SmolLM2系列LLM上验证Align -> KD流程的有效性。

Result: KD -> Align流程导致模型无法有效对齐目标行为，奖励和目标精度显著降低；而Align -> KD流程能稳健对齐这些行为，获得更优的目标导向指标和更低方差。

Conclusion: 参考模型的召回率是对齐中的首要设计选择，明确原则：对齐必须先于蒸馏。

Abstract: For efficiency, preference alignment is often performed on compact,
knowledge-distilled (KD) models. We argue this common practice introduces a
significant limitation by overlooking a key property of the alignment's
reference model: its distributional recall. We show that the standard KD ->
Align workflow diminishes the model's capacity to align rare yet desirable
behaviors, even under strong preference signals. We instead demonstrate that
reversing the pipeline (i.e., Align -> KD) is essential: alignment must first
be performed on a high-recall reference before distillation. Our contributions
are threefold. First, we provide a minimal working explanation of how the
reference model constrains preference alignment objectives at a fundamental
level. Second, we validate this theory in a controllable Mixture-of-Gaussians
experiment, where low-recall anchoring consistently results in suboptimal model
performance. Finally, we demonstrate that the same phenomenon holds in LLM
alignment with the SmolLM2 family: models aligned after KD fail to effectively
align target behaviors, resulting in substantially lower reward and target
precision. In contrast, our proposed Align -> KD pipeline robustly aligns these
behaviors, yielding models with superior target-oriented metrics and lower
variance. Together, these results establish reference-model recall as a
first-order design choice in alignment, offering a clear principle: alignment
must precede distillation.

Motivation: 股票时间序列具有行业相关性，利用这种相关性可以提高预测准确性。但现有基于超图的方法只能相对表面地捕捉行业相关性，存在两个关键限制：未充分考虑行业间的领先-滞后交互，以及未建模行业内部和行业间的多尺度信息。

Result: 在多个真实世界股票数据集上的实验结果表明，Hermes在效率和准确性方面都优于现有的最先进方法。

Conclusion: Hermes框架通过更有效地利用行业相关性，特别是通过捕捉行业间的领先-滞后关系和多尺度信息，显著提升了股票时间序列预测的性能。

Abstract: Time series forecasting occurs in a range of financial applications providing
essential decision-making support to investors, regulatory institutions, and
analysts. Unlike multivariate time series from other domains, stock time series
exhibit industry correlation. Exploiting this kind of correlation can improve
forecasting accuracy. However, existing methods based on hypergraphs can only
capture industry correlation relatively superficially. These methods face two
key limitations: they do not fully consider inter-industry lead-lag
interactions, and they do not model multi-scale information within and among
industries. This study proposes the Hermes framework for stock time series
forecasting that aims to improve the exploitation of industry correlation by
eliminating these limitations. The framework integrates moving aggregation and
multi-scale fusion modules in a hypergraph network. Specifically, to more
flexibly capture the lead-lag relationships among industries, Hermes proposes a
hyperedge-based moving aggregation module. This module incorporates a sliding
window and utilizes dynamic temporal aggregation operations to consider
lead-lag dependencies among industries. Additionally, to effectively model
multi-scale information, Hermes employs cross-scale, edge-to-edge message
passing to integrate information from different scales while maintaining the
consistency of each scale. Experimental results on multiple real-world stock
datasets show that Hermes outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in both
efficiency and accuracy.

Method: 提出了DIMIGNN模型，包含两个核心模块：多样性感知邻居选择机制（DNSM）确保变量与邻居具有高信息相似性同时保持邻居间多样性；动态多尺度融合模块（DMFM）动态调整不同时间尺度预测结果对最终预测的贡献。

Result: 在真实世界数据集上的广泛实验表明，DIMIGNN始终优于先前的方法。

Conclusion: DIMIGNN通过引入多样性感知邻居选择和动态多尺度融合，有效提升了多元时间序列预测的性能，解决了现有方法的关键局限性。

Abstract: Recently, numerous deep models have been proposed to enhance the performance
of multivariate time series (MTS) forecasting. Among them, Graph Neural
Networks (GNNs)-based methods have shown great potential due to their
capability to explicitly model inter-variable dependencies. However, these
methods often overlook the diversity of information among neighbors, which may
lead to redundant information aggregation. In addition, their final prediction
typically relies solely on the representation from a single temporal scale. To
tackle these issues, we propose a Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) with
Diversity-aware Neighbor Selection and Dynamic Multi-scale Fusion (DIMIGNN).
DIMIGNN introduces a Diversity-aware Neighbor Selection Mechanism (DNSM) to
ensure that each variable shares high informational similarity with its
neighbors while maintaining diversity among neighbors themselves. Furthermore,
a Dynamic Multi-Scale Fusion Module (DMFM) is introduced to dynamically adjust
the contributions of prediction results from different temporal scales to the
final forecasting result. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets
demonstrate that DIMIGNN consistently outperforms prior methods.

TL;DR: 本文提出了针对混合专家(MoE)模型的专用缩放定律，通过系统分解MoE设置，识别了5个关键影响因素，并构建了考虑所有必要因子的联合MoE缩放定律。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的稠密模型缩放定律不适用于MoE模型，因为MoE模型存在影响因素多样性、复杂耦合关系和非单调性能影响等挑战，需要专门研究MoE特定的缩放定律。

Method: 系统分解MoE设置，识别5个关键因素(数据大小D、总模型大小N、激活模型大小Na、激活专家数G、共享专家比例S)，设计446个对照实验来表征其边际效应，构建联合MoE缩放定律。

Result: 发现G和S的最优设置与模型架构和数据大小无关；随着N的缩放，最优激活参数比例Na/N变得更稀疏；提出了准确且具有洞察力的MoE缩放定律。

Conclusion: 提出的MoE缩放定律可作为未来MoE模型设计和训练的准确指导，解决了现有缩放定律不适用于MoE模型的问题。

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models have become the consensus approach for
enabling parameter-efficient scaling and cost-effective deployment in large
language models. However, existing scaling laws for dense models are
inapplicable to MoE models, which stems from three critical challenges: the
multiplicity of influencing factors, their intricate coupling relationships and
the non-monotonic nature of their performance impacts. They collectively
necessitate a fine-grained investigation into MoE-specific scaling laws. In
this work, we perform a systematic decomposition of MoE settings, identifying
five key factors that influence model performance from both size and structural
perspectives (data size ($D$), total model size ($N$), activated model size
($N_a$), number of active experts ($G$) and the ratio of shared experts ($S$)).
Specifically, we design $446$ controlled experiments to characterize their
marginal effects, ultimately constructing a comprehensive and precise joint MoE
scaling law that considers all essential factors. Furthermore, we derive the
theoretically optimal and practically efficiency-aware optimal configurations
for $G$, $S$ and $N_a/N$ with detailed analyses. Our results demonstrate that
the optimal settings for $G$ and $S$ are independent of both the model
architecture and data size. With the scaling of $N$, the optimal activation
parameter ratio of $N_a/N$ becomes sparser. Our proposed MoE scaling law could
function as an accurate and insightful guidance to facilitate future MoE model
design and training.

Conclusion: 提出的去中心化动态合作框架能有效解决联邦持续学习中的灾难性遗忘问题，在异构场景下实现更好的个性化模型性能。

Abstract: Federated continual learning (FCL) has garnered increasing attention for its
ability to support distributed computation in environments with evolving data
distributions. However, the emergence of new tasks introduces both temporal and
cross-client shifts, making catastrophic forgetting a critical challenge. Most
existing works aggregate knowledge from clients into a global model, which may
not enhance client performance since irrelevant knowledge could introduce
interference, especially in heterogeneous scenarios. Additionally, directly
applying decentralized approaches to FCL suffers from ineffective group
formation caused by task changes. To address these challenges, we propose a
decentralized dynamic cooperation framework for FCL, where clients establish
dynamic cooperative learning coalitions to balance the acquisition of new
knowledge and the retention of prior learning, thereby obtaining personalized
models. To maximize model performance, each client engages in selective
cooperation, dynamically allying with others who offer meaningful performance
gains. This results in non-overlapping, variable coalitions at each stage of
the task. Moreover, we use coalitional affinity game to simulate coalition
relationships between clients. By assessing both client gradient coherence and
model similarity, we quantify the client benefits derived from cooperation. We
also propose a merge-blocking algorithm and a dynamic cooperative evolution
algorithm to achieve cooperative and dynamic equilibrium. Comprehensive
experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method compared to various
baselines. Code is available at: https://github.com/ydn3229/DCFCL.

Conclusion: 享乐联盟方法能够发现功能重要、可解释且跨领域预测的计算单元，为理解神经元协作编码特征提供了新视角

Abstract: Fine-tuned Large Language Models (LLMs) encode rich task-specific features,
but the form of these representations, especially within MLP layers, remains
unclear. Empirical inspection of LoRA updates shows that new features
concentrate in mid-layer MLPs, yet the scale of these layers obscures
meaningful structure. Prior probing suggests that statistical priors may
strengthen, split, or vanish across depth, motivating the need to study how
neurons work together rather than in isolation.
  We introduce a mechanistic interpretability framework based on coalitional
game theory, where neurons mimic agents in a hedonic game whose preferences
capture their synergistic contributions to layer-local computations. Using
top-responsive utilities and the PAC-Top-Cover algorithm, we extract stable
coalitions of neurons: groups whose joint ablation has non-additive effects. We
then track their transitions across layers as persistence, splitting, merging,
or disappearance.
  Applied to LLaMA, Mistral, and Pythia rerankers fine-tuned on scalar IR
tasks, our method finds coalitions with consistently higher synergy than
clustering baselines. By revealing how neurons cooperate to encode features,
hedonic coalitions uncover higher-order structure beyond disentanglement and
yield computational units that are functionally important, interpretable, and
predictive across domains.

Motivation: 医学影像中严格的隐私法规禁止原始数据共享，联邦学习成为自然选择。但扫描仪引起的领域偏移会导致模型在外部站点失效。现有方法大多需要跨站点直接比较数据，与联邦学习的隐私约束冲突。

Method: 将领域对抗神经网络整合到联邦学习过程中，使用近端正则化方法稳定客户端间的对抗训练，解决朴素联邦DANN不收敛的问题。

Conclusion: 该方法成功解决了医学影像联邦学习中的领域偏移问题，实现了更好的跨站点泛化性能，同时严格遵守隐私保护要求。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) trains models locally at each research center or
clinic and aggregates only model updates, making it a natural fit for medical
imaging, where strict privacy laws forbid raw data sharing. A major obstacle is
scanner-induced domain shift: non-biological variations in hardware or
acquisition protocols can cause models to fail on external sites. Most
harmonization methods correct this shift by directly comparing data across
sites, conflicting with FL's privacy constraints. Domain Generalization (DG)
offers a privacy-friendly alternative - learning site-invariant representations
without sharing raw data - but standard DG pipelines still assume centralized
access to multi-site data, again violating FL's guarantees. This paper meets
these difficulties with a straightforward integration of a Domain-Adversarial
Neural Network (DANN) within the FL process. After demonstrating that a naive
federated DANN fails to converge, we propose a proximal regularization method
that stabilizes adversarial training among clients. Experiments on T1-weighted
3-D brain MRIs from the OpenBHB dataset, performing brain-age prediction on
participants aged 6-64 y (mean 22+/-6 y; 45 percent male) in training and 6-79
y (mean 19+/-13 y; 55 percent male) in validation, show that training on 15
sites and testing on 19 unseen sites yields superior cross-site generalization
over FedAvg and ERM while preserving data privacy.

Method: 使用8种模型融合方法、7个数据集和6种攻击方法，在336个不同的攻击设置下进行全面评估和统计分析。

Result: 模型融合无法可靠防御迁移攻击，相对迁移攻击成功率超过95%；更强的模型融合方法反而增加对迁移攻击的脆弱性；缓解表示偏差会增加脆弱性；权重平均是最脆弱的融合方法。

Abstract: Model Merging (MM) has emerged as a promising alternative to multi-task
learning, where multiple fine-tuned models are combined, without access to
tasks' training data, into a single model that maintains performance across
tasks. Recent works have explored the impact of MM on adversarial attacks,
particularly backdoor attacks. However, none of them have sufficiently explored
its impact on transfer attacks using adversarial examples, i.e., a black-box
adversarial attack where examples generated for a surrogate model successfully
mislead a target model.
  In this work, we study the effect of MM on the transferability of adversarial
examples. We perform comprehensive evaluations and statistical analysis
consisting of 8 MM methods, 7 datasets, and 6 attack methods, sweeping over 336
distinct attack settings. Through it, we first challenge the prevailing notion
of MM conferring free adversarial robustness, and show MM cannot reliably
defend against transfer attacks, with over 95% relative transfer attack success
rate. Moreover, we reveal 3 key insights for machine-learning practitioners
regarding MM and transferability for a robust system design: (1) stronger MM
methods increase vulnerability to transfer attacks; (2) mitigating
representation bias increases vulnerability to transfer attacks; and (3) weight
averaging, despite being the weakest MM method, is the most vulnerable MM
method to transfer attacks. Finally, we analyze the underlying reasons for this
increased vulnerability, and provide potential solutions to the problem. Our
findings offer critical insights for designing more secure systems employing
MM.

Motivation: 随着时间序列基础模型(TSFMs)数量的增长，在有限公共数据的领域中，高效识别最适合下游微调的模型变得越来越具有挑战性。

Method: TimeTic将观察到的模型-数据关系组织为上下文信息，利用表格基础模型作为上下文学习器，并引入基于模型层间熵演化的新型模型特征化方法。

Result: 在包含10个数据集、10个基础模型和3个预测任务的基准测试中，TimeTic的估计与真实微调性能高度一致，平均秩相关约为0.6，相比使用零样本性能作为可迁移性得分提高了30%。

Conclusion: TimeTic框架能够有效预测时间序列基础模型在下游数据集上的微调性能，为模型选择提供了高效可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Time series foundation models (TSFMs) offer strong zero-shot forecasting via
large-scale pre-training, yet fine-tuning remains critical for boosting
performance in domains with limited public data. With the growing number of
TSFMs, efficiently identifying the best model for downstream fine-tuning
becomes increasingly challenging. In this work, we introduce TimeTic, a
transferability estimation framework that recasts model selection as an
in-context-learning problem: given observations on known (source) datasets, it
predicts how a TSFM will perform after fine-tuning on a downstream (target)
dataset. TimeTic flexibly organizes the observed model-data relationships as
contextual information, allowing it to adapt seamlessly to various test-time
scenarios. Leveraging the natural tabular structure formed by dataset
meta-features, model characteristics, and fine-tuned performance, we employ
tabular foundation models to serve as in-context learners. We further introduce
a novel model characterization based on entropy evolution across model layers,
capturing embedding-space distinctions and enabling TimeTic to generalize
across arbitrary model sets. We establish a comprehensive benchmark for
transferability estimation including 10 datasets, 10 foundation models, and 3
forecasting tasks. On this benchmark, TimeTic's estimation demonstrates strong
alignment with actual fine-tuned performance for previously unseen datasets,
achieving a mean rank correlation of approximately 0.6 and a 30% improvement
compared to using zero-shot performance as the transferability score.

Abstract: The theory of discrete-time reinforcement learning (RL) has advanced rapidly
over the past decades. Although primarily designed for discrete environments,
many real-world RL applications are inherently continuous and complex. A major
challenge in extending discrete-time algorithms to continuous-time settings is
their sensitivity to time discretization, often leading to poor stability and
slow convergence. In this paper, we investigate deterministic policy gradient
methods for continuous-time RL. We derive a continuous-time policy gradient
formula based on an analogue of the advantage function and establish its
martingale characterization. This theoretical foundation leads to our proposed
algorithm, CT-DDPG, which enables stable learning with deterministic policies
in continuous-time environments. Numerical experiments show that the proposed
CT-DDPG algorithm offers improved stability and faster convergence compared to
existing discrete-time and continuous-time methods, across a wide range of
control tasks with varying time discretizations and noise levels.

Abstract: Detecting payment fraud in real-world banking streams requires models that

We introduce FraudTransformer, a sequence model that augments a vanilla

absolute timestamps or inter-event values, and (ii) a learned positional

FraudTransformer surpasses four strong classical baselines (Logistic
Regression, XGBoost and LightGBM) as well as transformer ablations that omit
either the time or positional component. On the held-out test set it delivers
the highest AUROC and PRAUC.

Conclusion: SAFDNet适合临床实际应用，为术中低血压早期预警提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Intraoperative hypotension (IOH) is strongly associated with postoperative
complications, including postoperative delirium and increased mortality, making
its early prediction crucial in perioperative care. While several artificial
intelligence-based models have been developed to provide IOH warnings, existing
methods face limitations in incorporating both time and frequency domain
information, capturing short- and long-term dependencies, and handling noise
sensitivity in biosignal data. To address these challenges, we propose a novel
Self-Adaptive Frequency Domain Network (SAFDNet). Specifically, SAFDNet
integrates an adaptive spectral block, which leverages Fourier analysis to
extract frequency-domain features and employs self-adaptive thresholding to
mitigate noise. Additionally, an interactive attention block is introduced to
capture both long-term and short-term dependencies in the data. Extensive
internal and external validations on two large-scale real-world datasets
demonstrate that SAFDNet achieves up to 97.3\% AUROC in IOH early warning,
outperforming state-of-the-art models. Furthermore, SAFDNet exhibits robust
predictive performance and low sensitivity to noise, making it well-suited for
practical clinical applications.

Conclusion: GBSK算法通过粒度球技术有效处理大规模聚类任务，同时提供自适应版本AGBSK简化参数设置，便于实际部署。

Abstract: To effectively handle clustering task for large-scale datasets, we propose a
novel scalable skeleton clustering algorithm, namely GBSK, which leverages the
granular-ball technique to capture the underlying structure of data. By
multi-sampling the dataset and constructing multi-grained granular-balls, GBSK
progressively uncovers a statistical "skeleton" -- a spatial abstraction that
approximates the essential structure and distribution of the original data.
This strategy enables GBSK to dramatically reduce computational overhead while
maintaining high clustering accuracy. In addition, we introduce an adaptive
version, AGBSK, with simplified parameter settings to enhance usability and
facilitate deployment in real-world scenarios. Extensive experiments conducted
on standard computing hardware demonstrate that GBSK achieves high efficiency
and strong clustering performance on large-scale datasets, including one with
up to 100 million instances across 256 dimensions. Our implementation and

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 符号音乐生成面临效率与质量的基本权衡：细粒度token化能获得强连贯性但序列长复杂度高，紧凑token化提高效率但牺牲了token内依赖关系。

Method: 采用基于延迟的调度机制（DP），将类复合token扩展到多个解码步骤，实现token内依赖关系的自回归建模，同时保持效率。DP是轻量级策略，无需额外参数，可无缝集成到现有表示中。

Result: 在符号管弦乐MIDI数据集上的实验表明，该方法在所有指标上都优于标准复合token化，并缩小了与细粒度token化的差距。

Conclusion: DP机制有效解决了符号音乐生成中的效率-质量权衡问题，在保持效率的同时显著提升了生成质量。

Abstract: Symbolic music generation faces a fundamental trade-off between efficiency
and quality. Fine-grained tokenizations achieve strong coherence but incur long
sequences and high complexity, while compact tokenizations improve efficiency
at the expense of intra-token dependencies. To address this, we adapt a
delay-based scheduling mechanism (DP) that expands compound-like tokens across
decoding steps, enabling autoregressive modeling of intra-token dependencies
while preserving efficiency. Notably, DP is a lightweight strategy that
introduces no additional parameters and can be seamlessly integrated into
existing representations. Experiments on symbolic orchestral MIDI datasets show
that our method improves all metrics over standard compound tokenizations and
narrows the gap to fine-grained tokenizations.

Motivation: 批归一化(BN)在深度学习中有重要作用，但由于深度强化学习(DRL)中数据的非独立同分布特性和动态分布变化，BN在DRL中的应用受限。作者认为BN在DRL中仍具有独特优势，需要找到适当的应用方法。

Conclusion: 通过适当的应用方法，BN能够适应DRL中不断变化的数据分布，提升收敛速度和最终性能，MA-BN为BN在DRL中的稳健集成提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Batch Normalization (BN) has played a pivotal role in the success of deep
learning by improving training stability, mitigating overfitting, and enabling
more effective optimization. However, its adoption in deep reinforcement
learning (DRL) has been limited due to the inherent non-i.i.d. nature of data
and the dynamically shifting distributions induced by the agent's learning
process. In this paper, we argue that, despite these challenges, BN retains
unique advantages in DRL settings, particularly through its stochasticity and
its ability to ease training. When applied appropriately, BN can adapt to
evolving data distributions and enhance both convergence speed and final
performance. To this end, we conduct a comprehensive empirical study on the use
of BN in off-policy actor-critic algorithms, systematically analyzing how
different training and evaluation modes impact performance. We further identify
failure modes that lead to instability or divergence, analyze their underlying
causes, and propose the Mode-Aware Batch Normalization (MA-BN) method with
practical actionable recommendations for robust BN integration in DRL
pipelines. We also empirically validate that, in RL settings, MA-BN accelerates
and stabilizes training, broadens the effective learning rate range, enhances
exploration, and reduces overall optimization difficulty. Our code is available

Abstract: Post-training of large language models involves a fundamental trade-off
between supervised fine-tuning (SFT), which efficiently mimics demonstrations
but tends to memorize, and reinforcement learning (RL), which achieves better
generalization at higher computational cost. Dynamic Fine-Tuning (DFT) recently
emerged as a promising middle ground, reweighting SFT objectives with token
probabilities and achieving improvements in certain reasoning domains, though
it exhibits instability in other tasks. We provide a analysis of DFT through
the reward-weighted regression (RWR) framework, revealing that it corresponds
to a specific auxiliary distribution choice that yields provably tighter RL
bounds than standard SFT. However, our analysis also uncovers a critical
limitation: this construction lacks distributional anchoring, leading to
progressive drift that undermines training stability. To address this, we
propose Anchored Supervised Fine-Tuning (ASFT), which augments DFT's
reweighting with lightweight KL regularization to preserve tightness while
ensuring stability. Empirically, ASFT consistently outperforms both SFT and DFT
across mathematical reasoning, medical knowledge grounding, and code
generation, achieving substantial improvements with minimal computational
overhead. Our RWR framework provides a systematic lens for understanding
post-training methods and demonstrates that principled theoretical analysis
leads to both stronger guarantees and practical gains.

*Tomer D. Meirman,Bracha Shapira,Noa Dagan,Lior S. Rokach*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SHAPoint是一个新颖的任务无关框架，将梯度提升树的预测准确性与基于点的风险评分可解释性相结合，支持分类、回归和生存任务，具有灵活性高、预处理需求少、运行速度快等优势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法生成可解释风险评分依赖于手动预处理、任务特定建模和简化假设，限制了其灵活性和预测能力。

Method: SHAPoint框架整合梯度提升树的预测能力和基于点的风险评分可解释性，支持多种任务类型，继承树模型的优势如缺失数据处理和单调约束支持。

Result: 实证结果显示SHAPoint产生紧凑可解释的评分，预测性能与最先进方法相当，但运行时间大幅减少。

Conclusion: SHAPoint是透明且可扩展风险分层的强大工具，提供灵活性和高效性。

Abstract: Interpretable risk scores play a vital role in clinical decision support, yet
traditional methods for deriving such scores often rely on manual
preprocessing, task-specific modeling, and simplified assumptions that limit
their flexibility and predictive power. We present SHAPoint, a novel,
task-agnostic framework that integrates the predictive accuracy of gradient
boosted trees with the interpretability of point-based risk scores. SHAPoint
supports classification, regression, and survival tasks, while also inheriting
valuable properties from tree-based models, such as native handling of missing
data and support for monotonic constraints. Compared to existing frameworks,
SHAPoint offers superior flexibility, reduced reliance on manual preprocessing,
and faster runtime performance. Empirical results show that SHAPoint produces
compact and interpretable scores with predictive performance comparable to
state-of-the-art methods, but at a fraction of the runtime, making it a
powerful tool for transparent and scalable risk stratification.

TL;DR: 该论文研究了LLMs中的知识同质性模式，提出通过图神经网络预测实体知识性得分，以优化知识覆盖和推理性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 受认知神经科学中语义聚类和启动效应的启发，探索LLMs中类似的知识同质性模式，即相关实体在知识掌握程度上具有相似性。

Method: 将LLM知识映射为图表示，分析实体与邻居的知识性关系，提出GNN回归模型预测实体级知识性得分，优先检查知识性较低的triplet。

Result: 发现LLMs倾向于对图中位置相近的实体具有相似的知识掌握程度，基于同质性原则的GNN模型能有效预测知识性得分。

Conclusion: 该方法能提高知识注入LLMs的主动标注效率，并增强推理密集型问答中的多跳路径检索性能。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have been increasingly studied as neural
knowledge bases for supporting knowledge-intensive applications such as
question answering and fact checking. However, the structural organization of
their knowledge remains unexplored. Inspired by cognitive neuroscience
findings, such as semantic clustering and priming, where knowing one fact
increases the likelihood of recalling related facts, we investigate an
analogous knowledge homophily pattern in LLMs. To this end, we map LLM
knowledge into a graph representation through knowledge checking at both the
triplet and entity levels. After that, we analyze the knowledgeability
relationship between an entity and its neighbors, discovering that LLMs tend to
possess a similar level of knowledge about entities positioned closer in the
graph. Motivated by this homophily principle, we propose a Graph Neural Network
(GNN) regression model to estimate entity-level knowledgeability scores for
triplets by leveraging their neighborhood scores. The predicted
knowledgeability enables us to prioritize checking less well-known triplets,
thereby maximizing knowledge coverage under the same labeling budget. This not
only improves the efficiency of active labeling for fine-tuning to inject
knowledge into LLMs but also enhances multi-hop path retrieval in
reasoning-intensive question answering.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mamba作为Transformer的高效替代方案，在长序列建模中表现出色，但其上下文学习的理论理解仍然有限，限制了对其底层机制的深入洞察。

Method: 通过开发针对Mamba结构非凸优化的新技术，分析了Mamba在线性回归上下文学习任务中的训练动态，建立了指数收敛速率和损失边界。

Result: 证明了Mamba能够以指数速率收敛到上下文学习解，其损失边界与Transformer相当，并揭示了Mamba通过在线梯度下降机制学习潜在函数。

Conclusion: Mamba的上下文学习机制与Transformer不同，前者通过在线梯度下降实现，后者通过梯度下降模拟实现，这一理论结果得到了实验验证。

Abstract: State-space models (SSMs), particularly Mamba, emerge as an efficient
Transformer alternative with linear complexity for long-sequence modeling.
Recent empirical works demonstrate Mamba's in-context learning (ICL)
capabilities competitive with Transformers, a critical capacity for large
foundation models. However, theoretical understanding of Mamba's ICL remains
limited, restricting deeper insights into its underlying mechanisms. Even
fundamental tasks such as linear regression ICL, widely studied as a standard
theoretical benchmark for Transformers, have not been thoroughly analyzed in
the context of Mamba. To address this gap, we study the training dynamics of
Mamba on the linear regression ICL task. By developing novel techniques
tackling non-convex optimization with gradient descent related to Mamba's
structure, we establish an exponential convergence rate to ICL solution, and
derive a loss bound that is comparable to Transformer's. Importantly, our
results reveal that Mamba can perform a variant of \textit{online gradient
descent} to learn the latent function in context. This mechanism is different
from that of Transformer, which is typically understood to achieve ICL through
gradient descent emulation. The theoretical results are verified by
experimental simulation.

TL;DR: 本文首次系统评估了Visual CoT在视觉扰动下的鲁棒性，发现虽然Visual CoT能提高准确率，但也增加了对输入扰动的敏感性，并提出了一种基于Grounding DINO的鲁棒性增强方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Visual CoT技术通过整合视觉编辑显著提升了视觉语言模型的推理能力，但其在图像级噪声下的鲁棒性尚未被探索。

Method: 构建了包含12种图像损坏类型的基准测试，在4个VQA数据集上比较使用和不使用Visual CoT的VLM性能，并提出了集成Grounding DINO模型的鲁棒性增强方法。

Result: Visual CoT在干净和噪声图像上都能提高绝对准确率，但对输入扰动更敏感，性能下降更显著；编辑后的图像块是脆弱性的主要来源。

Conclusion: 揭示了Visual CoT的脆弱性模式，并提供了有效的架构无关解决方案来增强视觉鲁棒性。

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) techniques have significantly enhanced reasoning in
Vision-Language Models (VLMs). Extending this paradigm, Visual CoT integrates
explicit visual edits, such as cropping or annotating regions of interest, into
the reasoning process, achieving superior multimodal performance. However, the
robustness of Visual CoT-based VLMs against image-level noise remains
unexplored. In this paper, we present the first systematic evaluation of Visual
CoT robustness under visual perturbations. Our benchmark spans 12 image
corruption types across 4 Visual Question Answering (VQA) datasets, enabling a
comprehensive comparison between VLMs that use Visual CoT, and VLMs that do
not. The results reveal that integrating Visual CoT consistently improves
absolute accuracy regardless of whether the input images are clean or corrupted
by noise; however, it also increases sensitivity to input perturbations,
resulting in sharper performance degradation compared to standard VLMs. Through
extensive analysis, we identify the intermediate reasoning components of Visual
CoT, i.e., the edited image patches , as the primary source of fragility.
Building on this analysis, we propose a plug-and-play robustness enhancement
method that integrates Grounding DINO model into the Visual CoT pipeline,
providing high-confidence local visual cues to stabilize reasoning. Our work
reveals clear fragility patterns in Visual CoT and offers an effective,
architecture-agnostic solution for enhancing visual robustness.

TL;DR: 提出SAE-RSV方法，利用稀疏自编码器从有限数据中精炼控制向量，通过语义去噪和特征增强来提升大语言模型的控制效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有控制方法依赖大规模数据集来学习行为信息，限制了在真实场景中的应用。从小数据集提取的控制向量常包含任务无关的噪声特征，影响控制效果。

Method: 使用稀疏自编码器对控制向量进行语义去噪和增强：首先根据SAE提供的语义去除任务无关特征，然后通过语义相似性丰富任务相关特征。

Result: 大量实验表明SAE-RSV显著优于所有基线方法，包括监督微调。

Conclusion: 通过SAE精炼原始控制向量，可以从有限训练数据中构建有效的控制向量。

Abstract: Steering has emerged as a promising approach in controlling large language
models (LLMs) without modifying model parameters. However, most existing
steering methods rely on large-scale datasets to learn clear behavioral
information, which limits their applicability in many real-world scenarios. The
steering vectors extracted from small dataset often contain task-irrelevant
noising features, which degrades their effectiveness. To refine the steering
vectors learned from limited data, we introduce Refinement of Steering Vector
via Sparse Autoencoder (SAE-RSV) that leverages SAEs to semantically denoise
and augment the steering vectors. In our framework, we first remove
task-irrelevant features according to their semantics provided by SAEs, and
then enrich task-relevant features missing from the small dataset through their
semantic similarity to the identified relevant features. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that the proposed SAE-RSV substantially outperforms all the
baseline methods including supervised fine-tuning. Our findings show that
effective steering vector can be constructed from limited training data by
refining the original steering vector through SAEs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多阶段任务中，比较不同阶段（如移动vs操作）的片段会产生无意义的反馈，阻碍策略学习，需要解决阶段错位问题

Method: STAIR方法：基于时间距离学习阶段近似，通过对比学习将时间相近状态分组为连贯阶段，无需预定义任务知识，动态适应策略变化，优先同阶段比较

Result: 实验证明STAIR在多阶段任务中表现优越，在单阶段任务中具有竞争力，人类研究表明STAIR近似阶段与人类认知一致

Conclusion: STAIR有效缓解阶段错位问题，提升多阶段任务中偏好强化学习的效果

Abstract: Preference-based reinforcement learning (PbRL) bypasses complex reward
engineering by learning rewards directly from human preferences, enabling
better alignment with human intentions. However, its effectiveness in
multi-stage tasks, where agents sequentially perform sub-tasks (e.g.,
navigation, grasping), is limited by stage misalignment: Comparing segments
from mismatched stages, such as movement versus manipulation, results in
uninformative feedback, thus hindering policy learning. In this paper, we
validate the stage misalignment issue through theoretical analysis and
empirical experiments. To address this issue, we propose STage-AlIgned Reward
learning (STAIR), which first learns a stage approximation based on temporal
distance, then prioritizes comparisons within the same stage. Temporal distance
is learned via contrastive learning, which groups temporally close states into
coherent stages, without predefined task knowledge, and adapts dynamically to
policy changes. Extensive experiments demonstrate STAIR's superiority in
multi-stage tasks and competitive performance in single-stage tasks.
Furthermore, human studies show that stages approximated by STAIR are
consistent with human cognition, confirming its effectiveness in mitigating
stage misalignment.

TL;DR: 本文挑战了强化学习中探索-利用权衡的传统观点，提出这种权衡可能是测量层面的假象。通过转向隐藏状态空间分析，发现探索和利用可以解耦，从而开发了VERL方法同时增强两者能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 重新审视RLVR中的探索-利用权衡，认为这种权衡可能不是基本约束而是测量层面的产物，希望通过隐藏状态空间分析揭示新的机会。

Method: 提出VERL方法，利用有效秩及其导数（ERV和ERA）量化探索和利用动态，通过直接塑造RL优势函数实现协同增强，使用理论稳定的ERA作为预测元控制器。

Result: 实验显示在多样化LLM和推理基准上取得一致增益，在具有挑战性的Gaokao 2024数据集上实现高达21.4%的绝对准确率提升。

Conclusion: 探索和利用可以在隐藏状态层面解耦，VERL方法成功实现了两者协同增强，为RLVR提供了新的设计原则。

Abstract: A prevailing view in Reinforcement Learning for Verifiable Rewards (RLVR)
interprets recent progress through the lens of an exploration-exploitation
trade-off, a perspective largely shaped by token-level metrics. We re-examine
this perspective, proposing that this perceived trade-off may not be a
fundamental constraint but rather an artifact of the measurement level. To
investigate this, we shift the analysis to the semantically rich hidden-state
space, adopting Effective Rank (ER) to quantify exploration and proposing its
novel first- and second-order derivatives, named Effective Rank Velocity (ERV)
and Effective Rank Acceleration (ERA), to capture exploitation dynamics. Our
analysis reveals that at the hidden-state level, exploration and exploitation
could be decoupled (Sec. 4). This finding reveals an opportunity to enhance
both capacities simultaneously. This insight motivates our method,
Velocity-Exploiting Rank-Learning (VERL), the first to operationalize the
principle of synergistic exploration-exploitation enhancement by directly
shaping the RL advantage function. The key innovation is leveraging the
theoretically stable ERA as a predictive meta-controller to create a
synergistic, dual-channel incentive structure. Instead of forcing a trade-off,
VERL prospectively amplifies rewards for exploration to preempt overconfidence
and reinforces exploitative gains to consolidate reasoning. Experiments across
diverse LLMs and reasoning benchmarks show consistent gains, including up to
21.4% absolute accuracy improvement on the challenging Gaokao 2024 dataset.

TL;DR: Tequila是一种无陷阱的三元量化优化方法，通过将死区陷阱权重重新用作动态偏置来重新激活它们，在几乎零推理开销的情况下提升模型容量和优化效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决三元权重量化中由于死区陷阱导致的显著精度下降问题，传统方法依赖缺乏高效硬件支持的混合精度乘法，而激进压缩会导致权重被困在死区边界。

Method: 提出Tequila方法，将死区陷阱权重重新用作动态偏置，使这些权重在前向传播中提供连续信号，在反向传播中接收直接有意义的梯度信号。

Result: 在五个基准测试中优于最先进的三元量化方法，在ARC基准上比SOTA基线获得>4%的准确率提升，接近全精度性能（差距<1%），推理速度提升3.0倍。

Conclusion: Tequila为在资源受限环境中部署先进LLM提供了高度实用和高效的实现方案。

Abstract: Quantization techniques are essential for the deployment of Large Language
Models (LLMs) on edge devices. However, prevailing methods often rely on
mixed-precision multiplication that lacks efficient hardware support, making it
not feasible. Ternary weight quantization addresses this by constraining
weights to {-1, 0, 1}, replacing expensive multiplications with
hardware-efficient additions. However, such aggressive compression leads to
significant accuracy degradation, even after costly quantization-aware training
with massive data. We identify the core issue as deadzone trapping: a large
number of weights are trapped at the deadzone boundary. This occurs because
these weights receive only noisy, uninformative gradients, preventing stable
escape from the deadzone and severely impeding model capacity and optimization.
To address this issue, we propose Tequila, a trapping-free quantization
optimization method that reactivates deadzone-trapped weights by repurposing
them as dynamic biases. This allows the repurposed weights to provide a
continuous signal in the forward pass and, critically, receive direct,
meaningful gradient signals during backpropagation, thereby enhancing model
capacity and optimization with nearly zero inference overhead. Extensive
evaluations demonstrate that Tequila outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA)
ternary quantization methods across five benchmarks. Specifically, on the ARC
benchmark, it achieves >4% accuracy gain over the SOTA baseline, nearly
matching full-precision performance (within <1% gap) with a 3.0x inference
speedup. Consequently, Tequila offers a highly practical and efficient
implementation for the deployment of advanced LLMs in resource-constrained
environments. The code is available at https://github.com/Tencent/AngelSlim.

TL;DR: IndexNet是一个基于MLP的多变量时间序列预测框架，通过引入索引嵌入模块（包含时间戳嵌入和通道嵌入）来利用描述性信息，提升长期周期模式捕捉能力和变量区分能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法大多忽略了时间戳和变量索引等描述性信息，这些信息包含丰富的上下文语义，对提升预测性能具有潜力。

Method: 提出IndexNet框架，包含索引嵌入模块：时间戳嵌入将时间戳转换为嵌入向量注入输入序列；通道嵌入为每个变量分配可训练的身份嵌入，区分异质变量。

Result: 在12个真实世界数据集上的实验表明，IndexNet与主流基线方法性能相当，验证了时间感知和变量感知设计的有效性。

Conclusion: IndexNet展示了强大的泛化性和可解释性，这两个方面在当前多变量时间序列预测研究中尚未充分探索。

Abstract: Multivariate time series forecasting (MTSF) plays a vital role in a wide
range of real-world applications, such as weather prediction and traffic flow
forecasting. Although recent advances have significantly improved the modeling
of temporal dynamics and inter-variable dependencies, most existing methods
overlook index-related descriptive information, such as timestamps and variable
indices, which carry rich contextual semantics. To unlock the potential of such
information and take advantage of the lightweight and powerful periodic capture
ability of MLP-based architectures, we propose IndexNet, an MLP-based framework
augmented with an Index Embedding (IE) module. The IE module consists of two
key components: Timestamp Embedding (TE) and Channel Embedding (CE).
Specifically, TE transforms timestamps into embedding vectors and injects them
into the input sequence, thereby improving the model's ability to capture
long-term complex periodic patterns. In parallel, CE assigns each variable a
unique and trainable identity embedding based on its index, allowing the model
to explicitly distinguish between heterogeneous variables and avoid homogenized
predictions when input sequences seem close. Extensive experiments on 12
diverse real-world datasets demonstrate that IndexNet achieves comparable
performance across mainstream baselines, validating the effectiveness of our
temporally and variably aware design. Moreover, plug-and-play experiments and
visualization analyses further reveal that IndexNet exhibits strong generality
and interpretability, two aspects that remain underexplored in current MTSF
research.

Result: 大量实验表明DyGEval作为有效评估器，能够在分布偏移下准确评估各种DGNN骨干网络在不同动态图上的性能

Conclusion: DyGEval成功解决了DGNN模型评估问题，为动态图神经网络的实际部署提供了可靠的性能评估工具

Abstract: Dynamic graph neural networks (DGNNs) have emerged as a leading paradigm for
learning from dynamic graphs, which are commonly used to model real-world
systems and applications. However, due to the evolving nature of dynamic graph
data distributions over time, well-trained DGNNs often face significant
performance uncertainty when inferring on unseen and unlabeled test graphs in
practical deployment. In this case, evaluating the performance of deployed
DGNNs at test time is crucial to determine whether a well-trained DGNN is
suited for inference on an unseen dynamic test graph. In this work, we
introduce a new research problem: DGNN model evaluation, which aims to assess
the performance of a specific DGNN model trained on observed dynamic graphs by
estimating its performance on unseen dynamic graphs during test time.
Specifically, we propose a Dynamic Graph neural network Evaluator, dubbed
DyGEval, to address this new problem. The proposed DyGEval involves a two-stage
framework: (1) test-time dynamic graph simulation, which captures the
training-test distributional differences as supervision signals and trains an
evaluator; and (2) DyGEval development and training, which accurately estimates
the performance of the well-trained DGNN model on the test-time dynamic graphs.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed DyGEval serves as an
effective evaluator for assessing various DGNN backbones across different
dynamic graphs under distribution shifts.

Motivation: 现有生成模型忽略了晶体对称性约束，导致生成的晶体对称性不足且不现实。需要开发能够严格遵循空间群和Wyckoff位置约束的生成方法。

Method: 使用条件对称噪声基分布和群条件等变向量场，将原子运动限制在其初始Wyckoff位置，并通过高效的群平均方法实现对称化。

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效生成高度对称的晶体结构，计算开销可忽略，为晶体材料设计提供了有力工具。

Abstract: Inorganic crystals are periodic, highly-symmetric arrangements of atoms in
three-dimensional space. Their structures are constrained by the symmetry
operations of a crystallographic \emph{space group} and restricted to lie in
specific affine subspaces known as \emph{Wyckoff positions}. The frequency an
atom appears in the crystal and its rough positioning are determined by its
Wyckoff position. Most generative models that predict atomic coordinates
overlook these symmetry constraints, leading to unrealistically high
populations of proposed crystals exhibiting limited symmetry. We introduce
Space Group Conditional Flow Matching, a novel generative framework that
samples significantly closer to the target population of highly-symmetric,
stable crystals. We achieve this by conditioning the entire generation process
on a given space group and set of Wyckoff positions; specifically, we define a
conditionally symmetric noise base distribution and a group-conditioned,
equivariant, parametric vector field that restricts the motion of atoms to
their initial Wyckoff position. Our form of group-conditioned equivariance is
achieved using an efficient reformulation of \emph{group averaging} tailored
for symmetric crystals. Importantly, it reduces the computational overhead of
symmetrization to a negligible level. We achieve state of the art results on
crystal structure prediction and de novo generation benchmarks. We also perform
relevant ablations.

Abstract: We propose $\textbf{E}$lectric $\textbf{C}$urrent $\textbf{D}$iscrete
$\textbf{D}$ata $\textbf{G}$eneration (ECD$^{2}$G), a pioneering method for
data generation in discrete settings that is grounded in electrical engineering
theory. Our approach draws an analogy between electric current flow in a
circuit and the transfer of probability mass between data distributions. We
interpret samples from the source distribution as current input nodes of a
circuit and samples from the target distribution as current output nodes. A
neural network is then used to learn the electric currents to represent the
probability flow in the circuit. To map the source distribution to the target,
we sample from the source and transport these samples along the circuit
pathways according to the learned currents. This process provably guarantees
transfer between data distributions. We present proof-of-concept experiments to
illustrate our ECD$^{2}$G method.

Motivation: 标准MoE架构的确定性路由机制存在脆弱性，导致模型校准不良和过度自信，使系统无法识别自身知识的局限性。

Method: 系统研究了三种在路由管道不同阶段引入不确定性的方法：权重空间、对数空间和选择空间，构建贝叶斯MoE路由框架。

Result: 在30亿参数MoE模型上的实验表明，该框架显著提高了路由稳定性、分布内校准和分布外检测能力。

Conclusion: 通过针对核心架构组件引入不确定性，可以创建更可靠的内在不确定性信号，为构建更鲁棒和自知的LLMs提供了实用路径。

Abstract: The Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture has enabled the creation of massive
yet efficient Large Language Models (LLMs). However, the standard deterministic
routing mechanism presents a significant limitation: its inherent brittleness
is a key contributor to model miscalibration and overconfidence, resulting in
systems that often do not know what they don't know.
  This thesis confronts this challenge by proposing a structured
\textbf{Bayesian MoE routing framework}. Instead of forcing a single,
deterministic expert selection, our approach models a probability distribution
over the routing decision itself. We systematically investigate three families
of methods that introduce this principled uncertainty at different stages of
the routing pipeline: in the \textbf{weight-space}, the \textbf{logit-space},
and the final \textbf{selection-space}.
  Through a series of controlled experiments on a 3-billion parameter MoE
model, we demonstrate that this framework significantly improves routing
stability, in-distribution calibration, and out-of-distribution (OoD)
detection. The results show that by targeting this core architectural
component, we can create a more reliable internal uncertainty signal. This work
provides a practical and computationally tractable pathway towards building
more robust and self-aware LLMs, taking a crucial step towards making them know
what they don't know.

Abstract: Robustness to modeling errors and uncertainties remains a central challenge
in reinforcement learning (RL). In this work, we address this challenge by
leveraging diffusion models to train robust RL policies. Diffusion models have
recently gained popularity in model-based RL due to their ability to generate
full trajectories "all at once", mitigating the compounding errors typical of
step-by-step transition models. Moreover, they can be conditioned to sample
from specific distributions, making them highly flexible. We leverage
conditional sampling to learn policies that are robust to uncertainty in
environment dynamics. Building on the established connection between
Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR) optimization and robust RL, we introduce
Adversarial Diffusion for Robust Reinforcement Learning (AD-RRL). AD-RRL guides
the diffusion process to generate worst-case trajectories during training,
effectively optimizing the CVaR of the cumulative return. Empirical results
across standard benchmarks show that AD-RRL achieves superior robustness and
performance compared to existing robust RL methods.

TL;DR: DART是一个解耦的GUI代理强化学习训练框架，通过异步模块设计解决VLM GUI代理在RL训练中的效率问题，在OSWorld基准上取得了42.13%的任务成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于视觉语言模型的GUI代理在自动化桌面和移动任务方面具有潜力，但面临强化学习应用的两大挑战：GUI环境多轮交互速度慢，以及代理-环境交互质量不足。

Method: 提出DART框架，将训练系统分为四个异步模块：环境集群、滚动服务、数据管理器和训练器，实现非阻塞通信和异步训练。引入自适应数据管理方案，包括预收集成功轨迹、动态调整滚动参数、选择性训练高熵步骤和使用截断重要性采样。

Result: DART显著提升了系统效率：1.6倍GPU利用率、1.9倍训练吞吐量和5.5倍环境利用率。在OSWorld基准上，DART-GUI-7B达到42.13%任务成功率，比基础模型提升14.61%，比开源SOTA高7.34%。

Conclusion: DART框架有效解决了GUI代理强化学习训练的效率瓶颈，通过解耦设计和自适应数据管理实现了显著的性能提升，为开源社区提供了有价值的贡献。

Abstract: Vision-language model (VLM) based GUI agents show promise for automating
complex desktop and mobile tasks, but face significant challenges in applying
reinforcement learning (RL): (1) slow multi-turn interactions with GUI
environments for policy rollout, and (2) insufficient high-quality
agent-environment interactions for policy learning. To address these
challenges, we propose DART, a Decoupled Agentic RL Training framework for GUI
agents, which coordinates heterogeneous modules in a highly decoupled manner.
DART separates the training system into four asynchronous modules: environment
cluster, rollout service, data manager, and trainer. This design enables
non-blocking communication, asynchronous training, rollout-wise trajectory
sampling, and per-worker model synchronization, significantly improving the
system efficiency: 1.6*GPU utilization for rollout, 1.9* training throughput,
and 5.5* environment utilization. To facilitate effective learning from
abundant samples, we introduce an adaptive data curation scheme: (1)
pre-collecting successful trajectories for challenging tasks to supplement
sparse success in online sampling; (2) dynamically adjusting rollout numbers
and trajectory lengths based on task difficulty; (3) training selectively on
high-entropy steps to prioritize critical decisions; (4) stabilizing learning
via truncated importance sampling for policy mismatch between policy rollout
and updating. On the OSWorld benchmark, DART-GUI-7B achieves a 42.13% task
success rate, a 14.61% absolute gain over the base model, and 7.34% higher than
open-source SOTA. We will fully open-source our training framework, data, and
model checkpoints via computer-use-agents.github.io/dart-gui, which we believe
is a timely contribution to the open-source community of agentic RL training.

### [177] [Towards Understanding Subliminal Learning: When and How Hidden Biases Transfer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23886)
*Simon Schrodi,Elias Kempf,Fazl Barez,Thomas Brox*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 语言模型在蒸馏过程中可以传递隐藏偏见，这种现象称为潜意识学习。研究发现潜意识学习不需要全局标记纠缠或logit泄漏，而是由一小部分分歧标记驱动，这些标记在具有不同偏见的教师模型会预测不同结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究语言模型蒸馏过程中隐藏偏见传递的机制，特别是为什么在硬蒸馏（学生只看到采样标记）中也会出现潜意识学习现象。

Method: 通过受控实验和机制分析，识别分歧标记的作用，并通过掩码这些标记来验证其关键性。还测试了微调早期层对潜意识学习的影响。

Result: 分歧标记是潜意识学习的关键，掩码这些标记能基本消除隐藏偏见传递。早期层在潜意识学习中起关键作用，微调单个早期层就足以实现潜意识学习。潜意识学习很脆弱，即使小的提示改写也能抑制它。

Conclusion: 潜意识学习主要由分歧标记驱动，通过早期层实现，但这种现象很脆弱，容易被干扰因素破坏。

Abstract: Language models can transfer hidden biases during distillation. For example,
a teacher that "likes owls" can make its student "like owls" too, even when the
training data consists only of lists of numbers. This surprising phenomenon is
called subliminal learning. Subliminal learning can be expected under soft
distillation, where the student is trained on the teacher's full next-token
distribution. But the fact that this also occurs under hard distillation-where
the student only sees sampled tokens-raises a deeper question: when and how
does subliminal learning actually occur? We answer this question through
controlled experiments and mechanistic analysis. Our results show that
subliminal learning does not need (global) token entanglement or logit leakage.
Instead, it comes down to a small set of divergence tokens-rare cases where
teachers with different biases would predict different tokens. Masking out
these tokens mostly removes the hidden bias transfer. Mechanistically,
divergence tokens reveal that early layers are critical. Surprisingly,
finetuning even a single such early layer is sufficient for subliminal
learning. Finally, we find that subliminal learning is fragile. Even small
changes, like paraphrasing prompts, are usually sufficient to suppress it.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代深度学习理论面临的关键挑战是解释基于梯度的优化方法在训练大规模复杂深度神经网络时的显著成功。虽然已有研究证明了特定架构的线性收敛性，但缺乏统一的理论框架。

Method: 提出了一个统一的理论证明，适用于任何使用分段非零多项式激活函数或ReLU、sigmoid激活函数的神经网络，在连续梯度下降训练中的线性收敛性。

Result: 建立了一个通用的定理，不仅覆盖了先前未知的架构，还在更弱的假设下整合了现有结果。理论预测与实际步长梯度下降方法的经验结果高度一致。

Conclusion: 该研究为深度神经网络梯度下降的线性收敛性提供了统一的理论基础，填补了现有理论的空白，并为更广泛的神经网络架构提供了收敛性保证。

Abstract: A key challenge in modern deep learning theory is to explain the remarkable
success of gradient-based optimization methods when training large-scale,
complex deep neural networks. Though linear convergence of such methods has
been proved for a handful of specific architectures, a united theory still
evades researchers. This article presents a unified proof for linear
convergence of continuous gradient descent, also called gradient flow, while
training any neural network with piecewise non-zero polynomial activations or
ReLU, sigmoid activations. Our primary contribution is a single, general
theorem that not only covers architectures for which this result was previously
unknown but also consolidates existing results under weaker assumptions. While
our focus is theoretical and our results are only exact in the infinitesimal
step size limit, we nevertheless find excellent empirical agreement between the
predictions of our result and those of the practical step-size gradient descent
method.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于正则化的方法在长期LLM持续学习中失败，关键原因是微调过程中功能方向的漂移。

Method: DOC方法追踪功能方向漂移并动态更新，通过调整新任务参数梯度与历史功能方向正交来减少新旧任务干扰。

Result: 在多个LLM持续学习基准测试中表现优于现有方法，有效减少灾难性遗忘。

Conclusion: DOC方法为持续LLM微调提供了鲁棒工具，通过动态正交化有效缓解灾难性遗忘问题。

Abstract: Catastrophic forgetting remains a critical challenge in continual learning
for large language models (LLMs), where models struggle to retain performance
on historical tasks when fine-tuning on new sequential data without access to
past datasets. In this paper, we first reveal that the drift of functional
directions during the fine-tuning process is a key reason why existing
regularization-based methods fail in long-term LLM continual learning. To
address this, we propose Dynamic Orthogonal Continual (DOC) fine-tuning, a
novel approach that tracks the drift of these functional directions and
dynamically updates them during the fine-tuning process. Furthermore, by
adjusting the gradients of new task parameters to be orthogonal to the tracked
historical function directions, our method mitigates interference between new
and old tasks. Extensive experiments on various LLM continual learning
benchmarks demonstrate that this approach outperforms prior methods,
effectively reducing catastrophic forgetting and providing a robust tool for
continuous LLM fine-tuning. Our code is available at

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出D-Gating方法，通过可微的结构化过参数化实现神经网络结构化稀疏，理论证明与L2,2/D正则化等价，实验验证在多个任务上优于传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 结构化稀疏正则化能有效压缩神经网络，但其不可微性导致与随机梯度下降不兼容，需要专门优化器或后处理剪枝，缺乏理论保证。

Method: D-Gating方法将每组权重分解为主权重向量和多个标量门控因子，实现完全可微的结构化过参数化。

Result: 理论证明D-Gating的局部最优解也是非光滑结构化L2,2/D惩罚的局部最优解，梯度流极限下以指数速度收敛到L2,2/D正则化损失。

Conclusion: D-Gating在理论上等价于解决原始组稀疏问题，但具有从非稀疏到稀疏优化的独特学习动态，在多个任务上实现了更好的性能-稀疏度权衡。

Abstract: Structured sparsity regularization offers a principled way to compact neural
networks, but its non-differentiability breaks compatibility with conventional
stochastic gradient descent and requires either specialized optimizers or
additional post-hoc pruning without formal guarantees. In this work, we propose
$D$-Gating, a fully differentiable structured overparameterization that splits
each group of weights into a primary weight vector and multiple scalar gating
factors. We prove that any local minimum under $D$-Gating is also a local
minimum using non-smooth structured $L_{2,2/D}$ penalization, and further show
that the $D$-Gating objective converges at least exponentially fast to the
$L_{2,2/D}$-regularized loss in the gradient flow limit. Together, our results
show that $D$-Gating is theoretically equivalent to solving the original group
sparsity problem, yet induces distinct learning dynamics that evolve from a
non-sparse regime into sparse optimization. We validate our theory across
vision, language, and tabular tasks, where $D$-Gating consistently delivers
strong performance-sparsity tradeoffs and outperforms both direct optimization
of structured penalties and conventional pruning baselines.

Motivation: 复杂地理环境导致无人机对地链路频繁中断，严重制约无人机群辅助移动通信的可靠性和服务质量，需要解决能效与通信公平性的平衡问题。

Conclusion: 所提出的通信控制协同设计机制能有效提升无人机群在复杂环境中的通信质量和能效表现。

Abstract: The deployment of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) swarm-assisted communication
networks has become an increasingly vital approach for remediating coverage
limitations in infrastructure-deficient environments, with especially pressing
applications in temporary scenarios, such as emergency rescue, military and
security operations, and remote area coverage. However, complex geographic
environments lead to unpredictable and highly dynamic wireless channel
conditions, resulting in frequent interruptions of air-to-ground (A2G) links
that severely constrain the reliability and quality of service in UAV
swarm-assisted mobile communications. To improve the quality of UAV
swarm-assisted communications in complex geographic environments, we propose an
integrated communication and control co-design mechanism. Given the stringent
energy constraints inherent in UAV swarms, our proposed mechanism is designed
to optimize energy efficiency while maintaining an equilibrium between
equitable communication rates for mobile ground users (GUs) and UAV energy
expenditure. We formulate the joint resource allocation and 3D trajectory
control problem as a Markov decision process (MDP), and develop a multi-agent
reinforcement learning (MARL) framework to enable real-time coordinated actions
across the UAV swarm. To optimize the action policy of UAV swarms, we propose a
novel multi-agent hybrid proximal policy optimization with action masking
(MAHPPO-AM) algorithm, specifically designed to handle complex hybrid action
spaces. The algorithm incorporates action masking to enforce hard constraints
in high-dimensional action spaces. Experimental results demonstrate that our
approach achieves a fairness index of 0.99 while reducing energy consumption by
up to 25% compared to baseline methods.

Motivation: 现有的黑盒模型在时间序列预测任务中缺乏可解释性，难以提供领域对齐的可操作解释。GMAN旨在在保持高性能的同时，提供多层次的解释能力。

Method: 将每个时间相关轨迹表示为有向图，应用增强的图神经加性网络（GNAN），通过特征分组和图分组来编码先验知识，实现特征级、节点级和图级的可解释性。

Result: 在包括血液检测死亡率预测和假新闻检测在内的真实世界数据集上，GMAN优于强大的非可解释黑盒基线模型，同时提供了可操作的、领域对齐的解释。

Conclusion: GMAN框架成功地在保持高性能的同时实现了多层次的模型可解释性，证明了在复杂时间序列任务中可解释模型可以超越黑盒方法。

Abstract: We introduce GMAN, a flexible, interpretable, and expressive framework that
extends Graph Neural Additive Networks (GNANs) to learn from sets of sparse
time-series data. GMAN represents each time-dependent trajectory as a directed
graph and applies an enriched, more expressive GNAN to each graph. It allows
users to control the interpretability-expressivity trade-off by grouping
features and graphs to encode priors, and it provides feature, node, and
graph-level interpretability. On real-world datasets, including mortality
prediction from blood tests and fake-news detection, GMAN outperforms strong
non-interpretable black-box baselines while delivering actionable,
domain-aligned explanations.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: HiViS是一种用于视觉语言模型推测解码的加速方法，通过将视觉令牌从草稿模型中隐藏，仅保留文本令牌作为显式输入，同时重用目标VLM的隐藏状态作为隐式视觉信息，实现了2.65倍的推理加速。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 推测解码在大型语言模型中有效，但应用于视觉语言模型时面临挑战：视觉令牌导致草稿模型与目标VLM语义表示不匹配，以及大量视觉令牌减慢草稿模型的自注意力计算。

Method: 提出显式-隐式输入分解框架，从草稿模型中移除所有视觉令牌，仅保留文本令牌作为显式输入，直接重用目标VLM的对应最后一层隐藏状态作为隐式视觉信息。采用多步自反馈训练策略进行高效训练。

Result: 将草稿模型的预填充序列长度压缩到目标VLM输入的0.7%-1.3%，同时保持无损生成质量。在不同模型和任务上的实验显示最高可达2.65倍的加速效果。

Conclusion: HiViS通过隐藏视觉令牌的方法有效解决了VLM中推测解码的挑战，显著加速了推理过程，同时保持了生成质量。

Abstract: Speculative decoding is an effective approach for accelerating inference in
Large Language models (LLMs), but its adaptation to Vision-Language models
(VLMs) remains challenging for additional visual tokens in multimodal inputs.
First, owing to the fact that the drafter and the target VLM may derived from
different families, the semantic representations of visual tokens in the target
VLM are misaligned with those in the drafter, introducing bias into the
KV-cache during the prefill stage. Second, the large number of visual tokens
substantially slows down the drafter's self-attention during the decoding
stage. We propose Hiding Visual Tokens from the Drafter for Speculative
Decoding in Vision-Language Models (HiViS), an explicit-implicit input
decomposition framework that alleviates the above inefficiency. All visual
tokens are removed from the drafter's input, retaining only textual tokens as
explicit inputs, while directly reusing the target VLM's corresponding
last-layer hidden states as implicit visual information without additional
processing. To train the drafter efficiently, we introduces multi-step
self-feedback training strategy with dynamic data selection and sequential
embedding supervision to simulate reasoning during training. Our approach
compresses the prefill sequence length of the drafter to only 0.7%-1.3% of the
target VLM's input, while maintaining lossless generation quality. Extensive
experiments across diverse models and tasks demonstrate up to 2.65x speedup,
confirming the effectiveness of HiViS in accelerating VLM inference.

Result: 发现神经元利用率随模型进化下降反映更强泛化；训练过程呈现动态轨迹；任务完成依赖多专家协作，共享专家驱动集中；神经元激活模式可作为数据多样性细粒度代理指标。

Conclusion: MUI可作为基准性能的补充指标，为理解MoE模型的容量、动态和专业化提供新视角。

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures have emerged as a promising direction,
offering efficiency and scalability by activating only a subset of parameters
during inference. However, current research remains largely
performance-centric, with limited understanding of its internal mechanisms,
thereby constraining broader progress. In this work, we use an internal metric
to investigate the mechanisms of MoE architecture by explicitly incorporating
routing mechanisms and analyzing expert-level behaviors. Through systematic
analyses of a wide range of publicly available MoE models, we uncover several
findings: (1) neuron utilization decreases as models evolve, reflecting
stronger generalization; (2) training exhibits a dynamic trajectory, where
benchmark performance alone provides limited signal while MUI reveals deeper
insights; (3) task completion emerges from collaborative contributions of
multiple experts, with shared experts driving concentration; and (4) activation
patterns at the neuron level provide a fine-grained proxy for data diversity.
Together, these results demonstrate the potential of MUI as a complementary
indicator to benchmark performance, offering new insights into the capacity,
dynamics, and specialization of MoE models. Our project can be found at

Result: 发现条件扩散模型存储的额外信息等于X与Y之间的互信息，分类器自由引导能有效提升采样时的互信息，这在图像模型中特别有用。

Conclusion: 扩散模型与凯利准则存在深刻联系，分类器自由引导通过提升互信息改善生成质量，同时指出了将扩散模型视为无限深度自编码器的观点存在细微差别。

Abstract: We draw a connection between diffusion models and the Kelly criterion for
maximizing returns in betting games. We find that conditional diffusion models
store additional information to bind the signal $X$ with the conditioning
information $Y$, equal to the mutual information between them. Classifier-free
guidance effectively boosts the mutual information between $X$ and $Y$ at
sampling time. This is especially helpful in image models, since the mutual
information between images and their labels is low, a fact which is intimately
connected to the manifold hypothesis. Finally, we point out some nuances in the
popular perspective that diffusion models are infinitely deep autoencoders. In
doing so, we relate the denoising loss to the Fermi Golden Rule from quantum
mechanics.

Conclusion: 这些进展标志着从被动解码向大脑活动与语言之间生成性、灵活接口的转变。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized human-machine interaction,
and have been extended by embedding diverse modalities such as images into a
shared language space. Yet, neural decoding has remained constrained by static,
non-interactive methods. We introduce CorText, a framework that integrates
neural activity directly into the latent space of an LLM, enabling open-ended,
natural language interaction with brain data. Trained on fMRI data recorded
during viewing of natural scenes, CorText generates accurate image captions and
can answer more detailed questions better than controls, while having access to
neural data only. We showcase that CorText achieves zero-shot generalization
beyond semantic categories seen during training. Furthermore, we present a
counterfactual analysis that emulates in-silico cortical microstimulation.
These advances mark a shift from passive decoding toward generative, flexible
interfaces between brain activity and language.

Conclusion: 该框架为大规模地理空间分析提供了实用的解决方案，能够高效识别具有最高空间相似性的聚类，同时满足用户定义的精度和召回要求。

Abstract: Advancements in tools like Shapely 2.0 and Triton can significantly improve
the efficiency of spatial similarity computations by enabling faster and more
scalable geometric operations. However, for extremely large datasets, these
optimizations may face challenges due to the sheer volume of computations
required. To address this, we propose a framework that reduces the number of
clusters requiring verification, thereby decreasing the computational load on
these systems. The framework integrates dynamic similarity index thresholding,
supervised scheduling, and recall-constrained optimization to efficiently
identify clusters with the highest spatial similarity while meeting
user-defined precision and recall requirements. By leveraging Kernel Density
Estimation (KDE) to dynamically determine similarity thresholds and machine
learning models to prioritize clusters, our approach achieves substantial
reductions in computational cost without sacrificing accuracy. Experimental
results demonstrate the scalability and effectiveness of the method, offering a
practical solution for large-scale geospatial analysis.

Motivation: 解决传统Chain-of-Thought方法将高层策略规划与低层逐步执行混为一谈的问题，导致计算效率低下、推理路径探索有限和可解释性降低。

Method: 采用两阶段训练方法：监督微调（SFT）结合强化学习（RL），在测试时使用高效扩展策略，探索阶段随机生成简洁高层计划，执行阶段确定性执行选定计划。

Result: 在AIME'2024上达到58.1%准确率，仅使用不到10%的解码token；在医学基准测试中比标准SFT准确率高14.5%，仅使用3.5%的token。

Conclusion: E²C框架通过分离规划与执行，实现了最先进的性能、强泛化能力和更高可解释性，显著降低自一致性开销。

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and its variants have markedly advanced the reasoning
abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), yet their monolithic and
auto-regressive architecture inherently conflates high-level strategic planning
with low-level step-by-step execution, leading to computational inefficiency,
limited exploration of reasoning paths, and reduced interpretability. To
overcome these issues, we propose the Explore-Execute Chain ($E^2C$), a
structured reasoning framework that decouples reasoning into two distinct
phases: an exploratory phase that stochastically generates succinct high-level
plans, followed by an execution phase that deterministically carries out the
chosen plan. Our approach incorporates a two-stage training methodology, which
combines Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) - augmented by a novel data generation
algorithm enforcing strict plan adherence - with a subsequent Reinforcement
Learning (RL) stage that capitalizes on the informativeness of exploration and
reinforces the determinism of execution.This decomposition enables an efficient
test-time scaling strategy: on AIME'2024, $E^2C$ Test Time Scaling reaches
58.1% accuracy using <10% of the decoding tokens required by comparable methods
(e.g., Forest-of-Thought), sharply cutting self-consistency overhead. For
cross-domain adaptation, our Exploration-Focused SFT (EF-SFT) fine-tunes with
only 3.5% of the tokens used by standard SFT yet yields up to 14.5% higher
accuracy than standard SFT on medical benchmarks, delivering state-of-the-art
performance, strong generalization, and greater interpretability by separating
planning from execution. The code and pre-trained models for the project are

Method: 基于合作博弈理论中的方向性谈判解决方案(DiBS)，开发了DiBS-MTL方法，该方法对单调非线性任务损失变换具有不变性，确保收敛到帕累托稳定点。

Result: 在标准多任务学习基准测试中，DiBS-MTL与最先进方法性能相当，同时对显著降低现有方法性能的非线性单调变换保持鲁棒性。

Conclusion: DiBS-MTL为多任务学习提供了一种对任务损失尺度变换鲁棒的有效方法，解决了任务主导问题，并在理论和实证上都表现出色。

Abstract: Multitask learning (MTL) algorithms typically rely on schemes that combine
different task losses or their gradients through weighted averaging. These
methods aim to find Pareto stationary points by using heuristics that require
access to task loss values, gradients, or both. In doing so, a central
challenge arises because task losses can be arbitrarily, nonaffinely scaled
relative to one another, causing certain tasks to dominate training and degrade
overall performance. A recent advance in cooperative bargaining theory, the
Direction-based Bargaining Solution (DiBS), yields Pareto stationary solutions
immune to task domination because of its invariance to monotonic nonaffine task
loss transformations. However, the convergence behavior of DiBS in nonconvex
MTL settings is currently not understood. To this end, we prove that under
standard assumptions, a subsequence of DiBS iterates converges to a Pareto
stationary point when task losses are possibly nonconvex, and propose DiBS-MTL,
a computationally efficient adaptation of DiBS to the MTL setting. Finally, we
validate DiBS-MTL empirically on standard MTL benchmarks, showing that it
achieves competitive performance with state-of-the-art methods while
maintaining robustness to nonaffine monotonic transformations that
significantly degrade the performance of existing approaches, including prior
bargaining-inspired MTL methods. Code available at

*Rylan Schaeffer,Noam Levi,Andreas Kirsch,Theo Guenais,Brando Miranda,Elyas Obbad,Sanmi Koyejo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文验证了Chinchilla缩放定律的可靠性，发现尽管存在参数定义模糊等问题，但其核心结果（计算最优的token-参数比例）对参数扰动具有鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Chinchilla论文提出了计算最优缩放原则，但后续研究对其有效性提出质疑，包括置信区间宽、不同方法间存在差异等。本文旨在验证Chinchilla的指导原则是否仍然可靠。

Method: 通过分析Chinchilla中模型参数的三种可能解释，并系统性地对模型参数进行四种结构化扰动，评估关键结果对参数变化的敏感性。

Result: 发现模型参数的不同解释对关键结果影响不大，计算最优的token-参数比例在参数扰动下保持稳定，Chinchilla的核心结论具有鲁棒性。

Conclusion: Chinchilla的缩放定律仍然是语言模型扩展的可靠指导，为领域提供了重新信心。

Abstract: Hoffman et al (2022)'s Chinchilla paper introduced the principle of
compute-optimal scaling, laying a foundation for future scaling of language
models. In the years since, however, valid concerns about Chinchilla have been
raised: wide confidence intervals, discrepancies between its three approaches,
and incongruities with other scaling laws. This raises a critical question for
the field: Can practitioners still rely on Chinchilla's prescriptions? Our work
demonstrates the answer is yes. We begin by uncovering that the model
parameters central to Chinchilla's analyses were ambiguous: three
interpretations are possible, with relative differences between different
interpretations of model parameters as high as 15.2%. We find that, perhaps
surprisingly, which model parameters are used for the analyses do not
meaningfully affect key results: the scaling law estimates and the
compute-optimal tokens-to-parameter ratio. Indeed, under one interpretation,
the tokens-to-parameter ratio becomes more constant with the target compute
budget. We then ask how distorted the Chinchilla model parameters could have
been without meaningfully affecting the key results. By deliberately perturbing
model parameters in four structured ways, we find that key Chinchilla results
are most sensitive to additive or systematic errors, which can alter the
otherwise flat trend of the optimal tokens-to-parameter ratio, but overall,
Chinchilla's key results withstand sizable perturbations. Altogether, our
findings offer the field renewed confidence in Chinchilla as a durable guide
for scaling language models.

Motivation: 随着深度网络规模增大，数据集中的标签噪声会损害模型性能，需要自动化的错误检测工具。

Method: 利用神经网络倒数第二层特征，基于错误标签样本与其真实类别样本的特征相似性高于其他类别样本的观察，通过紧密相似簇中的标签出现概率来检测和修正错误。

Result: 实验表明该方法在各种噪声类型下都表现出高性能，并能自动修正错误以提升数据集质量。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种模型无关的错误检测和修正方案，能有效处理数据集中的标签噪声问题。

Abstract: Label noise in datasets could damage the performance of neural net training.
As the size of modern deep networks grows, there is a growing demand for
automated tools for detecting such errors. In this paper, we propose post-hoc,
model-agnostic error detection and rectification methods utilizing the
penultimate feature from a neural network. Our idea is based on the observation
that the similarity between the penultimate feature of a mislabeled data point
and its true class data points is higher than that for data points from other
classes, making the probability of label occurrence within a tight, similar
cluster informative for detecting and rectifying errors. Extensive experiments
show our method not only demonstrates high performance across various noises
but also automatically rectifies these errors to improve the quality of
datasets.

Motivation: 金融衍生品智能合约自动化能带来效率提升，但将金融规范转化为燃气高效的可执行代码面临挑战，特别是从高级规范生成功能正确且经济可行的代码。

Method: 使用近端策略优化(PPO)智能体从预定义库中选择最优代码片段，采用两阶段课程学习：先训练功能正确性，再关注燃气优化。

Conclusion: 这项工作为自动合成可靠且经济可持续的智能合约提供了可行方法，弥合了高级金融协议与高效链上执行之间的差距。

Abstract: Smart contract-based automation of financial derivatives offers substantial
efficiency gains, but its real-world adoption is constrained by the complexity
of translating financial specifications into gas-efficient executable code. In
particular, generating code that is both functionally correct and economically
viable from high-level specifications, such as the Common Domain Model (CDM),
remains a significant challenge. This paper introduces a Reinforcement Learning
(RL) framework to generate functional and gas-optimized Solidity smart
contracts directly from CDM specifications. We employ a Proximal Policy
Optimization (PPO) agent that learns to select optimal code snippets from a
pre-defined library. To manage the complex search space, a two-phase curriculum
first trains the agent for functional correctness before shifting its focus to
gas optimization. Our empirical results show the RL agent learns to generate
contracts with significant gas savings, achieving cost reductions of up to
35.59% on unseen test data compared to unoptimized baselines. This work
presents a viable methodology for the automated synthesis of reliable and
economically sustainable smart contracts, bridging the gap between high-level
financial agreements and efficient on-chain execution.

TL;DR: 提出了GUIDE框架，通过集成LLM生成的邻接矩阵和观测数据，解决了现有因果发现方法在可扩展性、计算效率和混合数据类型适应性方面的限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有因果发现方法（如PC、GES、ICA-LiNGAM）面临可扩展性差、计算能耗高、难以处理混合数据类型等问题，特别是在节点数超过70时表现不佳。

Method: GUIDE采用双编码器架构，将LLM生成的邻接矩阵与观测数据集成，通过强化学习代理动态平衡奖励最大化（准确性）和惩罚避免（DAG约束）。

Result: 相比RL-BIC和KCRL方法，运行时间平均减少约42%；相比NOTEARS和GraN-DAG，准确率平均提高约117%；能够扩展到70个以上节点，而基线方法在此规模下失效。

Conclusion: GUIDE框架在计算效率和准确性方面显著优于现有方法，能够有效处理混合数据类型并实现大规模节点的因果发现。

Abstract: Modern causal discovery methods face critical limitations in scalability,
computational efficiency, and adaptability to mixed data types, as evidenced by
benchmarks on node scalability (30, $\le 50$, $\ge 70$ nodes), computational
energy demands, and continuous/non-continuous data handling. While traditional
algorithms like PC, GES, and ICA-LiNGAM struggle with these challenges,
exhibiting prohibitive energy costs for higher-order nodes and poor scalability
beyond 70 nodes, we propose \textbf{GUIDE}, a framework that integrates Large
Language Model (LLM)-generated adjacency matrices with observational data
through a dual-encoder architecture. GUIDE uniquely optimizes computational
efficiency, reducing runtime on average by $\approx 42%$ compared to RL-BIC and
KCRL methods, while achieving an average $\approx 117%$ improvement in accuracy
over both NOTEARS and GraN-DAG individually. During training, GUIDE's
reinforcement learning agent dynamically balances reward maximization
(accuracy) and penalty avoidance (DAG constraints), enabling robust performance
across mixed data types and scalability to $\ge 70$ nodes -- a setting where
baseline methods fail.

TL;DR: 该论文研究了弱到强泛化中的关键问题：当使用带有虚假相关性的弱教师模型生成的伪标签来微调强预训练学生模型时，W2S是否会发生以及如何改进失败情况。论文考虑了由群体不平衡引起的两种虚假相关性来源，并提出了理论分析和改进算法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究在存在虚假相关性的下游任务中，弱到强泛化是否会发生以及如何改进失败情况，特别是在群体不平衡的标注数据和未标注数据场景下。

Method: 理论分析在比例渐近极限下精确表征W2S增益，并通过大量实验验证理论。提出一种简单有效的算法补救措施：在W2S微调后，在强学生模型的高置信度数据子集上重新训练。

Result: 理论表明当未标注数据与标注数据的少数群体比例相同时，W2S总是发生；但当比例不同时，W2S可能失败，且增益随比例差异的平方而减小。实验验证了理论结果，提出的算法在多个基准测试中取得了显著改进。

Conclusion: W2S在群体不平衡场景下可能失败，但通过在高置信度数据子集上重新训练学生模型，可以显著提升W2S性能，且该方法无需群体标签信息。

Abstract: We initiate a unified theoretical and algorithmic study of a key problem in
weak-to-strong (W2S) generalization: when fine-tuning a strong pre-trained
student with pseudolabels from a weaker teacher on a downstream task with
spurious correlations, does W2S happen, and how to improve it upon failures? We
consider two sources of spurious correlations caused by group imbalance: (i) a
weak teacher fine-tuned on group-imbalanced labeled data with a minority group
of fraction $\eta_\ell$, and (ii) a group-imbalanced unlabeled set
pseudolabeled by the teacher with a minority group of fraction $\eta_u$.
Theoretically, a precise characterization of W2S gain at the proportional
asymptotic limit shows that W2S always happens with sufficient pseudolabels
when $\eta_u = \eta_\ell$ but may fail when $\eta_u \ne \eta_\ell$, where W2S
gain diminishes as $(\eta_u - \eta_\ell)^2$ increases. Our theory is
corroborated by extensive experiments on various spurious correlation
benchmarks and teacher-student pairs. To boost W2S performance upon failures,
we further propose a simple, effective algorithmic remedy that retrains the
strong student on its high-confidence data subset after W2S fine-tuning. Our
algorithm is group-label-free and achieves consistent, substantial improvements
over vanilla W2S fine-tuning.

TL;DR: 提出SLA（稀疏-线性注意力）方法，将注意力权重分为关键、边缘和可忽略三类，分别应用O(N²)、O(N)计算和跳过处理，显著加速扩散模型的注意力计算。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散变换器（DiT）模型中，由于长序列长度和二次复杂度，注意力延迟是主要瓶颈。研究发现注意力权重可分为高秩大权重和低秩小权重两部分。

Method: SLA将注意力权重分类为关键、边缘和可忽略三类：对关键权重应用O(N²)注意力，对边缘权重应用O(N)线性注意力，跳过可忽略权重。所有计算集成在单个GPU内核中，支持前向和后向传播。

Result: 仅需少量微调步骤，SLA使DiT模型的注意力计算减少20倍，注意力计算减少95%且不降低生成质量。高效GPU内核实现注意力计算13.7倍加速和端到端视频生成2.2倍加速。

Conclusion: SLA成功融合稀疏和线性注意力，显著加速扩散模型的注意力计算，在保持生成质量的同时实现大幅性能提升。

Abstract: In Diffusion Transformer (DiT) models, particularly for video generation,
attention latency is a major bottleneck due to the long sequence length and the
quadratic complexity. We find that attention weights can be separated into two
parts: a small fraction of large weights with high rank and the remaining
weights with very low rank. This naturally suggests applying sparse
acceleration to the first part and low-rank acceleration to the second. Based
on this finding, we propose SLA (Sparse-Linear Attention), a trainable
attention method that fuses sparse and linear attention to accelerate diffusion
models. SLA classifies attention weights into critical, marginal, and
negligible categories, applying O(N^2) attention to critical weights, O(N)
attention to marginal weights, and skipping negligible ones. SLA combines these
computations into a single GPU kernel and supports both forward and backward
passes. With only a few fine-tuning steps using SLA, DiT models achieve a 20x
reduction in attention computation, resulting in significant acceleration
without loss of generation quality. Experiments show that SLA reduces attention
computation by 95% without degrading end-to-end generation quality,
outperforming baseline methods. In addition, we implement an efficient GPU
kernel for SLA, which yields a 13.7x speedup in attention computation and a
2.2x end-to-end speedup in video generation on Wan2.1-1.3B.

Motivation: 现有研究主要关注预训练损失和判别式评估的缩放定律，而生成式评估（如数学问题解决、软件工程）的缩放定律研究相对较少。

Method: 提出了三种缩放定律：(1) 基于计算量的缩放定律；(2) 基于模型参数和训练token数量的缩放定律；(3) 基于黄金参考解对数似然的缩放定律。

Result: 研究发现：(1) 计算量和参数+token缩放定律在最后1.5-2.5个数量级稳定，而黄金参考似然缩放定律在最后5个数量级稳定；(2) 三种缩放定律预测性能相当，但计算量缩放定律在小k时预测稍差，黄金参考似然在大k时预测稍差。

Conclusion: 建立了计算量缩放定律作为参数和token缩放定律的计算最优包络的理论联系，为研究人员预测生成式性能提供了方法论和见解。

Abstract: Neural scaling laws have played a central role in modern machine learning,
driving the field's ever-expanding scaling of parameters, data and compute.
While much research has gone into fitting scaling laws and predicting
performance on pretraining losses and on discriminative evaluations such as
multiple-choice question-answering, comparatively little research has been done
on fitting scaling laws and predicting performance on generative evaluations
such as mathematical problem-solving or software engineering. We propose and
evaluate three different pretraining scaling laws for fitting pass-at-$k$ on
generative evaluations and for predicting pass-at-$k$ of the most expensive
model using the performance of cheaper models. Our three scaling laws differ in
the covariates used: (1) compute, (2) model parameters and tokens, (3) log
likelihoods of gold reference solutions. We make four main contributions: (1)
We show how generative evaluations offer new hyperparameters (in our setting,
$k$) that researchers can use to control the scaling laws parameters and the
predictability of performance. (2) In terms of scaling law parameters, we find
that the compute scaling law and parameters\,+\,tokens scaling law stabilize
for the last ~$1.5{-}2.5$ orders of magnitude, whereas the gold reference
likelihood scaling law stabilizes for the last ~$5$ orders of magnitude. (3) In
terms of predictive performance, we find all three scaling laws perform
comparably, although the compute scaling law predicts slightly worse for small
$k$ and the log likelihoods of gold reference solutions predicts slightly worse
for large $k$. (4) We establish a theoretical connection that the compute
scaling law emerges as the compute-optimal envelope of the
parameters-and-tokens scaling law. Our framework provides researchers and
practitioners with insights and methodologies to forecast generative
performance.

Conclusion: GPS-MTM被确立为一个稳健的轨迹分析基础模型，将移动数据定位为大规模表示学习的一等模态。代码已发布供进一步参考。

Abstract: Foundation models have driven remarkable progress in text, vision, and video
understanding, and are now poised to unlock similar breakthroughs in trajectory
modeling. We introduce the GPSMasked Trajectory Transformer (GPS-MTM), a
foundation model for large-scale mobility data that captures patterns of
normalcy in human movement. Unlike prior approaches that flatten trajectories
into coordinate streams, GPS-MTM decomposes mobility into two complementary
modalities: states (point-of-interest categories) and actions (agent
transitions). Leveraging a bi-directional Transformer with a self-supervised
masked modeling objective, the model reconstructs missing segments across
modalities, enabling it to learn rich semantic correlations without manual
labels. Across benchmark datasets, including Numosim-LA, Urban Anomalies, and
Geolife, GPS-MTM consistently outperforms on downstream tasks such as
trajectory infilling and next-stop prediction. Its advantages are most
pronounced in dynamic tasks (inverse and forward dynamics), where contextual
reasoning is critical. These results establish GPS-MTM as a robust foundation
model for trajectory analytics, positioning mobility data as a first-class
modality for large-scale representation learning. Code is released for further
reference.

Conclusion: 该框架统一了风险敏感学习和乐观主义，为多智能体强化学习中的合作提供了理论基础和实际有效的方法。

Abstract: Risk sensitivity has become a central theme in reinforcement learning (RL),
where convex risk measures and robust formulations provide principled ways to
model preferences beyond expected return. Recent extensions to multi-agent RL
(MARL) have largely emphasized the risk-averse setting, prioritizing robustness
to uncertainty. In cooperative MARL, however, such conservatism often leads to
suboptimal equilibria, and a parallel line of work has shown that optimism can
promote cooperation. Existing optimistic methods, though effective in practice,
are typically heuristic and lack theoretical grounding. Building on the dual
representation for convex risk measures, we propose a principled framework that
interprets risk-seeking objectives as optimism. We introduce optimistic value
functions, which formalize optimism as divergence-penalized risk-seeking
evaluations. Building on this foundation, we derive a policy-gradient theorem
for optimistic value functions, including explicit formulas for the entropic
risk/KL-penalty setting, and develop decentralized optimistic actor-critic
algorithms that implement these updates. Empirical results on cooperative
benchmarks demonstrate that risk-seeking optimism consistently improves
coordination over both risk-neutral baselines and heuristic optimistic methods.
Our framework thus unifies risk-sensitive learning and optimism, offering a
theoretically grounded and practically effective approach to cooperation in
MARL.

Abstract: Device-cloud collaboration has emerged as a promising paradigm for deploying
large language models (LLMs), combining the efficiency of lightweight on-device
inference with the superior performance of powerful cloud LLMs. An essential
problem in this scenario lies in deciding whether a given query is best handled
locally or delegated to the cloud. Existing approaches typically rely on
external routers, implemented as binary classifiers, which often struggle to
determine task difficulty from the prompt's surface pattern. To address these
limitations, we propose a framework where the on-device LLM makes routing
decisions at the end of its solving process, with this capability instilled
through post-training. In particular, we formulate a reward maximization
problem with carefully designed rewards that encourage effective problem
solving and judicious offloading to the cloud. To solve this problem, we
develop a group-adaptive policy gradient algorithm, featuring a group-level
policy gradient, designed to yield an unbiased gradient estimator of the
reward, and adaptive prompt filtering, developed to enforce the constraint on
cloud LLM usage. Extensive experiments across models and benchmarks show that
the proposed methodology consistently outperforms existing baselines and
significantly narrows the gap to full cloud LLM performance.

Abstract: One of the most pressing challenges in artificial intelligence is to make
models more transparent to their users. Recently, explainable artificial
intelligence has come up with numerous method to tackle this challenge. A
promising avenue is to use concept-based explanations, that is, high-level
concepts instead of plain feature importance score. Among this class of
methods, Concept Activation vectors (CAVs), Kim et al. (2018) stands out as one
of the main protagonists. One interesting aspect of CAVs is that their
computation requires sampling random examples in the train set. Therefore, the
actual vectors obtained may vary from user to user depending on the randomness
of this sampling. In this paper, we propose a fine-grained theoretical analysis
of CAVs construction in order to quantify their variability. Our results,
confirmed by experiments on several real-life datasets, point out towards an
universal result: the variance of CAVs decreases as $1/N$, where $N$ is the
number of random examples. Based on this we give practical recommendations for
a resource-efficient application of the method.

Conclusion: ICQL展示了上下文学习在鲁棒和组合价值估计中的潜力，为离线RL提供了一个原则性且有效的框架。

Abstract: Accurately estimating the Q-function is a central challenge in offline
reinforcement learning. However, existing approaches often rely on a single
global Q-function, which struggles to capture the compositional nature of tasks
involving diverse subtasks. We propose In-context Compositional Q-Learning
(\texttt{ICQL}), the first offline RL framework that formulates Q-learning as a
contextual inference problem, using linear Transformers to adaptively infer
local Q-functions from retrieved transitions without explicit subtask labels.
Theoretically, we show that under two assumptions--linear approximability of
the local Q-function and accurate weight inference from retrieved
context--\texttt{ICQL} achieves bounded Q-function approximation error, and
supports near-optimal policy extraction. Empirically, \texttt{ICQL}
substantially improves performance in offline settings: improving performance
in kitchen tasks by up to 16.4\%, and in Gym and Adroit tasks by up to 8.6\%
and 6.3\%. These results highlight the underexplored potential of in-context
learning for robust and compositional value estimation, positioning
\texttt{ICQL} as a principled and effective framework for offline RL.

used to refer to this line of work, emphasizing different
aspects.}\citep[e.g.,][]{siegler1984strategychoices, siegler2000rebirth}
explains important aspects of children's arithmetic learning based upon
principles including learning from developmentally naturalistic data,
probabilistic representation, confidence-based retrieval, and the phase-like
importance of scaffolding strategies, such as finger-counting. Here we recast
SCT as a ``Small Math Model'' (SMM), employing a neural-network-based
architecture analogous to LLMs. The SMM extends SCT to include counting
practice\footnote{The original SCT model was pre-biased in accordance with the
supposed experience of counting.}, symbol (number) embedding, and gated
attention. Similar to earlier work, the SMM demonstrates constructive and
destructive interference between counting and addition, and the ``wave-like''
use of finger-counting as sum recall improves. We plan to extend the SMM to
later aspects of the decades-long SCT program, including adaptive strategy
choice and eventually strategy discovery, providing a unified platform to
investigate the understanding of numerical characteristics and relationships
essential for mathematical reasoning -- as it can emerge in LLM-based agents.

*Youssef Sabiri,Walid Houmaidi,Ouail El Maadi,Yousra Chtouki*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: AQUAIR是一个开放获取的室内水产养殖环境质量数据集，记录了6个环境变量，包含超过23,000个时间戳观测数据，填补了智能水产养殖信息学的关键空白。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于描述室内水产养殖设施空气环境的公共数据集稀缺，限制了结合空气条件和水质动态的预测和异常检测工具的开发。

Method: 使用单个Awair HOME监测器每5分钟采样一次，从2024年10月14日至2025年1月9日，采用ISO标准安装高度，经过参考仪器校准检查，并通过开源处理管道进行数据标准化。

Result: 数据集显示稳定的环境条件（中位数CO2=758 ppm；PM2.5=12微克/立方米），有明显的喂食时间峰值，为短期预测、事件检测和传感器漂移研究提供了丰富结构。

Conclusion: AQUAIR填补了智能水产养殖信息学的关键空白，为数据中心的机器学习课程和环境传感研究提供了可复现的基准。

Abstract: Smart aquaculture systems depend on rich environmental data streams to
protect fish welfare, optimize feeding, and reduce energy use. Yet public
datasets that describe the air surrounding indoor tanks remain scarce, limiting
the development of forecasting and anomaly-detection tools that couple
head-space conditions with water-quality dynamics. We therefore introduce
AQUAIR, an open-access public dataset that logs six Indoor Environmental
Quality (IEQ) variables--air temperature, relative humidity, carbon dioxide,
total volatile organic compounds, PM2.5 and PM10--inside a fish aquaculture
facility in Amghass, Azrou, Morocco. A single Awair HOME monitor sampled every
five minutes from 14 October 2024 to 9 January 2025, producing more than 23,000
time-stamped observations that are fully quality-controlled and publicly
archived on Figshare. We describe the sensor placement, ISO-compliant mounting
height, calibration checks against reference instruments, and an open-source
processing pipeline that normalizes timestamps, interpolates short gaps, and
exports analysis-ready tables. Exploratory statistics show stable conditions
(median CO2 = 758 ppm; PM2.5 = 12 micrograms/m3) with pronounced feeding-time
peaks, offering rich structure for short-horizon forecasting, event detection,
and sensor drift studies. AQUAIR thus fills a critical gap in smart aquaculture
informatics and provides a reproducible benchmark for data-centric machine
learning curricula and environmental sensing research focused on head-space
dynamics in recirculating aquaculture systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于距离的成对成本在自监督和对比特征学习中至关重要，混合密度网络是生成模型和密度近似的常用方法

Method: 将混合密度网络与对比成本结合，使用四种核化矩阵成本：标量成本、向量-矩阵成本、矩阵-矩阵成本（Schur补的迹）和SVD成本（核范数）

Result: 成功实现了数据密度近似，学习了定义混合密度所需的多个中心

Conclusion: 提出的方法有效结合了混合密度网络和对比学习，通过多种核化矩阵成本实现了更好的密度近似

Abstract: Pairwise distance-based costs are crucial for self-supervised and contrastive
feature learning. Mixture Density Networks (MDNs) are a widely used approach
for generative models and density approximation, using neural networks to
produce multiple centers that define a Gaussian mixture. By combining MDNs with
contrastive costs, this paper proposes data density approximation using four
types of kernelized matrix costs: the scalar cost, the vector-matrix cost, the
matrix-matrix cost (the trace of Schur complement), and the SVD cost (the
nuclear norm), for learning multiple centers required to define a mixture
density.

Result: 理论分析表明当人口统计信息已知时，该方法优于基线方法。在合成和真实数据上的实验验证了所提方法的有效性。

Conclusion: DAFH算法能够在无需人口统计信息的情况下实现偏好公平性，同时保持高模型准确率，适用于高风险应用场景。

Abstract: As machine learning (ML) algorithms are increasingly used in social domains
to make predictions about humans, there is a growing concern that these
algorithms may exhibit biases against certain social groups. Numerous notions
of fairness have been proposed in the literature to measure the unfairness of
ML. Among them, one class that receives the most attention is
\textit{parity-based}, i.e., achieving fairness by equalizing treatment or
outcomes for different social groups. However, achieving parity-based fairness
often comes at the cost of lowering model accuracy and is undesirable for many
high-stakes domains like healthcare. To avoid inferior accuracy, a line of
research focuses on \textit{preference-based} fairness, under which any group
of individuals would experience the highest accuracy and collectively prefer
the ML outcomes assigned to them if they were given the choice between various
sets of outcomes. However, these works assume individual demographic
information is known and fully accessible during training. In this paper, we
relax this requirement and propose a novel \textit{demographic-agnostic
fairness without harm (DAFH)} optimization algorithm, which jointly learns a
group classifier that partitions the population into multiple groups and a set
of decoupled classifiers associated with these groups. Theoretically, we
conduct sample complexity analysis and show that our method can outperform the
baselines when demographic information is known and used to train decoupled
classifiers. Experiments on both synthetic and real data validate the proposed
method.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩展单设备设备端LLM范式，利用对等设备状态信息来优化D2D通信性能，特别是在低电量等资源受限场景下。

Method: 使用上下文感知奖励（基于延迟容忍度和设备电量状态）进行KL微调，开发了两种轻量变体：PEARL（Head+LoRA）和PEARL-Lite（仅Head）。

Result: PEARL在合成场景中优于启发式和紧凑模型基线，在协作低电量情况下节能高达16%，PEARL-Lite实现亚20ms推理且性能接近。

Conclusion: 对等感知上下文、奖励对齐训练和基于头部的效率使LLM适用于始终在线的设备端跨层控制。

Abstract: We present PEARL (Peer-Enhanced Adaptive Radio via On-Device LLM), a
framework for cooperative cross-layer optimization in device-to-device (D2D)
communication. Building on our previous work on single-device on-device LLMs,
PEARL extends the paradigm by leveraging both publisher and subscriber states
to guide Wi-Fi Aware (WA) parameter selection. A context-aware reward, which
normalizes latency by application tolerances and modulates energy by device
battery states, provides richer supervision for KL-based finetuning. We study
two lightweight variants: PEARL (Head + Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA)) achieves
the best overall performance, while PEARL-Lite (Head-only) delivers sub-20 ms
inference at near-identical objective scores. Across synthetic scenarios
grounded in real measurements, PEARL improves objective scores over heuristic
and compact model baselines and reduces energy by up to 16% in cooperative
low-battery cases. These results demonstrate that peer-aware context,
reward-aligned training, and head-based efficiency make LLMs practical for
always-on, on-device cross-layer control.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统transformer的全局注意力机制计算成本高，而现有等变transformer仅支持低阶等变特征和局部上下文窗口，限制了表达能力和性能。

Method: 采用Clebsch-Gordon卷积在SO(3)不可约表示上实现高效全局注意力，通过利用Clebsch-Gordon矩阵的稀疏性来扩展高阶不可约特征。

Conclusion: 该方法实现了O(N log N)的输入令牌复杂度，能够对所有阶次的等变特征进行建模，并具有良好的可扩展性。

Abstract: The global attention mechanism is one of the keys to the success of
transformer architecture, but it incurs quadratic computational costs in
relation to the number of tokens. On the other hand, equivariant models, which
leverage the underlying geometric structures of problem instance, often achieve
superior accuracy in physical, biochemical, computer vision, and robotic tasks,
at the cost of additional compute requirements. As a result, existing
equivariant transformers only support low-order equivariant features and local
context windows, limiting their expressiveness and performance. This work
proposes Clebsch-Gordan Transformer, achieving efficient global attention by a
novel Clebsch-Gordon Convolution on $\SO(3)$ irreducible representations. Our
method enables equivariant modeling of features at all orders while achieving
${O}(N \log N)$ input token complexity. Additionally, the proposed method
scales well with high-order irreducible features, by exploiting the sparsity of
the Clebsch-Gordon matrix. Lastly, we also incorporate optional token
permutation equivariance through either weight sharing or data augmentation. We
benchmark our method on a diverse set of benchmarks including n-body
simulation, QM9, ModelNet point cloud classification and a robotic grasping
dataset, showing clear gains over existing equivariant transformers in GPU
memory size, speed, and accuracy.

Motivation: 传统第一性原理方法计算点缺陷能级和结构成本高昂，现有基于图神经网络的机器学习力场存在过平滑和长程相互作用表示不佳的问题，特别是在建模点缺陷时尤为突出。

Method: 提出ADAPT模型，用直接坐标空间表示替代图表示，显式考虑所有原子对相互作用，将原子视为token，使用Transformer编码器建模原子间相互作用。

Conclusion: ADAPT通过创新的坐标空间表示和Transformer架构，有效解决了图神经网络在点缺陷建模中的局限性，为加速材料缺陷研究提供了高效的计算工具。

Abstract: Point defects play a central role in driving the properties of materials.
First-principles methods are widely used to compute defect energetics and
structures, including at scale for high-throughput defect databases. However,
these methods are computationally expensive, making machine-learning force
fields (MLFFs) an attractive alternative for accelerating structural
relaxations. Most existing MLFFs are based on graph neural networks (GNNs),
which can suffer from oversmoothing and poor representation of long-range
interactions. Both of these issues are especially of concern when modeling
point defects. To address these challenges, we introduce the Accelerated Deep
Atomic Potential Transformer (ADAPT), an MLFF that replaces graph
representations with a direct coordinates-in-space formulation and explicitly
considers all pairwise atomic interactions. Atoms are treated as tokens, with a
Transformer encoder modeling their interactions. Applied to a dataset of
silicon point defects, ADAPT achieves a roughly 33 percent reduction in both
force and energy prediction errors relative to a state-of-the-art GNN-based
model, while requiring only a fraction of the computational cost.

Abstract: Inverse problems governed by partial differential equations (PDEs) are
crucial in science and engineering. They are particularly challenging due to
ill-posedness, data sparsity, and the added complexity of irregular geometries.
Classical PDE-constrained optimization methods are computationally expensive,
especially when repeated posterior sampling is required. Learning-based
approaches improve efficiency and scalability, yet most are designed for
regular domains or focus on forward modeling. Here, we introduce {\em
GeoFunFlow}, a geometric diffusion model framework for inverse problems on
complex geometries. GeoFunFlow combines a novel geometric function autoencoder
(GeoFAE) and a latent diffusion model trained via rectified flow. GeoFAE
employs a Perceiver module to process unstructured meshes of varying sizes and
produces continuous reconstructions of physical fields, while the diffusion
model enables posterior sampling from sparse and noisy data. Across five
benchmarks, GeoFunFlow achieves state-of-the-art reconstruction accuracy over
complex geometries, provides calibrated uncertainty quantification, and
delivers efficient inference compared to operator-learning and diffusion model
baselines.

Motivation: 电子健康记录数据具有长序列、多变量、稀疏和缺失值等复杂特性，传统深度学习方法面临挑战。Transformer模型计算复杂度高且上下文长度有限，而状态空间模型主要关注序列级信息而非通道级数据。

Method: 提出HyMaTE混合模型，结合状态空间模型（如Mamba）的线性时间序列建模能力和注意力机制的优势，专门为纵向数据表示学习设计。

Abstract: Electronic health Records (EHRs) have become a cornerstone in modern-day
healthcare. They are a crucial part for analyzing the progression of patient
health; however, their complexity, characterized by long, multivariate
sequences, sparsity, and missing values poses significant challenges in
traditional deep learning modeling. While Transformer-based models have
demonstrated success in modeling EHR data and predicting clinical outcomes,
their quadratic computational complexity and limited context length hinder
their efficiency and practical applications. On the other hand, State Space
Models (SSMs) like Mamba present a promising alternative offering linear-time
sequence modeling and improved efficiency for handling long sequences, but
focus mostly on mixing sequence-level information rather than channel-level
data. To overcome these challenges, we propose HyMaTE (A Hybrid Mamba and
Transformer Model for EHR Representation Learning), a novel hybrid model
tailored for representing longitudinal data, combining the strengths of SSMs
with advanced attention mechanisms. By testing the model on predictive tasks on
multiple clinical datasets, we demonstrate HyMaTE's ability to capture an
effective, richer, and more nuanced unified representation of EHR data.
Additionally, the interpretability of the outcomes achieved by self-attention
illustrates the effectiveness of our model as a scalable and generalizable
solution for real-world healthcare applications. Codes are available at:

Motivation: 解决时间序列预测中长程依赖关系建模的挑战，传统方法在计算复杂度和信息保持能力之间存在权衡，而回声状态网络虽然高效但表达能力有限。

Method: 提出EFNs框架，包含扩展回声状态网络(X-ESNs)和MLP读出层，采用新颖的矩阵门控复合随机激活(MCRA)增强表达能力，并使用双流架构动态选择特征。

Conclusion: EFNs框架成功平衡了计算效率和表达能力，为长序列时间序列预测提供了有效的解决方案，在多个基准测试中表现出色。

Abstract: At the heart of time-series forecasting (TSF) lies a fundamental challenge:
how can models efficiently and effectively capture long-range temporal
dependencies across ever-growing sequences? While deep learning has brought
notable progress, conventional architectures often face a trade-off between
computational complexity and their ability to retain accumulative information
over extended horizons.
  Echo State Networks (ESNs), a class of reservoir computing models, have
recently regained attention for their exceptional efficiency, offering constant
memory usage and per-step training complexity regardless of input length. This
makes them particularly attractive for modeling extremely long-term event
history in TSF. However, traditional ESNs fall short of state-of-the-art
performance due to their limited nonlinear capacity, which constrains both
their expressiveness and stability.
  We introduce Echo Flow Networks (EFNs), a framework composed of a group of
extended Echo State Networks (X-ESNs) with MLP readouts, enhanced by our novel
Matrix-Gated Composite Random Activation (MCRA), which enables complex,
neuron-specific temporal dynamics, significantly expanding the network's
representational capacity without compromising computational efficiency. In
addition, we propose a dual-stream architecture in which recent input history
dynamically selects signature reservoir features from an infinite-horizon
memory, leading to improved prediction accuracy and long-term stability.
  Extensive evaluations on five benchmarks demonstrate that EFNs achieve up to
4x faster training and 3x smaller model size compared to leading methods like
PatchTST, reducing forecasting error from 43% to 35%, a 20% relative
improvement. One instantiation of our framework, EchoFormer, consistently
achieves new state-of-the-art performance across five benchmark datasets: ETTh,
ETTm, DMV, Weather, and Air Quality.

Conclusion: 草稿令牌可能为思维链提示提供了一种新机制，即使这些令牌不包含语义信息，也能通过中间计算支持推理过程。

Abstract: In this technical note, we study the problem of inverse permutation learning
in decoder-only transformers. Given a permutation and a string to which that
permutation has been applied, the model is tasked with producing the original
(``canonical'') string. We argue that this task models a natural robustness
property across a variety of reasoning tasks, including long-context retrieval,
multiple choice QA and in-context learning. Our primary contribution is an
impossibility result: we show that an arbitrary depth, decoder-only transformer
cannot learn this task. This result concerns the expressive capacity of
decoder-only transformer models and is agnostic to training dynamics or sample
complexity. We give a pair of alternative constructions under which inverse
permutation learning is feasible. The first of these highlights the fundamental
role of the causal attention mask, and reveals a gap between the expressivity
of encoder-decoder transformers and the more popular decoder-only architecture.
The latter result is more surprising: we show that simply padding the input
with ``scratch tokens" yields a construction under which inverse permutation
learning is possible. We conjecture that this may suggest an alternative
mechanism by which chain-of-thought prompting or, more generally, intermediate
``thinking'' tokens can enable reasoning in large language models, even when
these tokens encode no meaningful semantic information (e.g., the results of
intermediate computations).

Conclusion: 局部核技术能够有效分离不同概率分布的支持集，为分类问题提供了新的理论框架和实用算法

Abstract: The problem of classification in machine learning has often been approached
in terms of function approximation. In this paper, we propose an alternative
approach for classification in arbitrary compact metric spaces which, in
theory, yields both the number of classes, and a perfect classification using a
minimal number of queried labels. Our approach uses localized trigonometric
polynomial kernels initially developed for the point source signal separation
problem in signal processing. Rather than point sources, we argue that the
various classes come from different probability distributions. The localized
kernel technique developed for separating point sources is then shown to
separate the supports of these distributions. This is done in a hierarchical
manner in our MASC algorithm to accommodate touching/overlapping class
boundaries. We illustrate our theory on several simulated and real life
datasets, including the Salinas and Indian Pines hyperspectral datasets and a
document dataset.

Conclusion: 机器学习模型，特别是基于集成的分类器，为传统预报方法提供了有效、可扩展的替代方案，具有实时台风预测和集成到决策支持系统的潜力。

Abstract: Accurate cyclone forecasting is essential for minimizing loss of life,
infrastructure damage, and economic disruption. Traditional numerical weather
prediction models, though effective, are computationally intensive and prone to
error due to the chaotic nature of atmospheric systems. This study proposes a
machine learning (ML) approach to forecasting tropical cyclone trajectory and
status using time series data from the National Hurricane Center, including
recently added best track wind radii. A two-stage ML pipeline is developed: a
regression model first predicts cyclone features maximum wind speed, minimum
pressure, trajectory length, and directional change using a sliding window of
historical data. These outputs are then input into classification models to
predict the cyclone's categorical status. Gradient boosting regression and
three classifiers random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM), and
multilayer perceptron (MLP) are evaluated. After hyperparameter tuning and
synthetic minority oversampling (SMOTE), the RF classifier achieves the highest
performance with 93% accuracy, outperforming SVM and MLP across precision,
recall, and F1 score. The RF model is particularly robust in identifying
minority cyclone statuses and minimizing false negatives. Regression results
yield low mean absolute errors, with pressure and wind predictions within about
2.2 mb and 2.4 kt, respectively. These findings demonstrate that ML models,
especially ensemble-based classifiers, offer an effective, scalable alternative
to traditional forecasting methods, with potential for real-time cyclone
prediction and integration into decision support systems.

Conclusion: 建立了一个新颖的理论基础和实际可扩展的LLM遗忘框架，解决了现有方法的不稳定性问题。

Abstract: Machine unlearning in large language models (LLMs) is essential for privacy
and safety; however, existing approaches remain unstable and unreliable. A
widely used strategy, the gradient difference method, applies gradient descent
on retained data while performing gradient ascent on forget data, the data
whose influence should be removed. However, when combined with cross-entropy
loss, this procedure causes unbounded growth of weights and gradients, leading
to training instability and degrading both forgetting and retention. We provide
a theoretical framework that explains this failure, explicitly showing how
ascent on the forget set destabilizes optimization in the feedforward MLP
layers of LLMs. Guided by this insight, we propose Bounded Parameter-Efficient
Unlearning, a parameter-efficient approach that stabilizes LoRA-based
fine-tuning by applying bounded functions to MLP adapters. This simple
modification controls the weight dynamics during ascent, enabling the gradient
difference method to converge reliably. Across the TOFU, TDEC, and MUSE
benchmarks, and across architectures and scales from 125M to 8B parameters, our
method achieves substantial improvements in forgetting while preserving
retention, establishing a novel theoretically grounded and practically scalable
framework for unlearning in LLMs.

Motivation: 现有自编码器方法通常分别关注全局或局部几何特性，全局方法存在距离近似误差累积问题，局部方法容易收敛到扭曲大规模关系的次优解。

Method: 采用非对称架构设计，在编码器施加全局距离约束，在解码器施加局部几何约束，同时保留多尺度几何结构。

Conclusion: 非对称设计自然契合编码器和解码器的不同角色，能够有效同时保留数据的全局和局部几何结构。

Abstract: Autoencoders have emerged as powerful models for visualization and
dimensionality reduction based on the fundamental assumption that
high-dimensional data is generated from a low-dimensional manifold. A critical
challenge in autoencoder design is to preserve the geometric structure of data
in the latent space, with existing approaches typically focusing on either
global or local geometric properties separately. Global approaches often
encounter errors in distance approximation that accumulate, while local methods
frequently converge to suboptimal solutions that distort large-scale
relationships. We propose Multi-Scale Geometric Autoencoder (MAE), which
introduces an asymmetric architecture that simultaneously preserves both scales
of the geometric structure by applying global distance constraints to the
encoder and local geometric constraints to the decoder. Through theoretical
analysis, we establish that this asymmetric design aligns naturally with the
distinct roles of the encoder and decoder components. Our comprehensive
experiments on both synthetic manifolds and real-world datasets demonstrate
that MAE consistently outperforms existing methods across various evaluation
metrics.

*Ruibo Chen,Sheng Zhang,Yihan Wu,Tong Zheng,Peihua Mai,Heng Huang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了RSP（随机选择探测）框架，通过统计假设检验来检测模型之间的相关性，为LLM和VLM提供可解释的p值来量化模型关联证据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有模型相似性检测方法需要访问模型参数或产生无原则阈值的启发式分数，限制了应用范围。需要一种原则性的统计框架来可靠检测模型是否经过微调或完全相同。

Method: RSP在参考模型上优化文本或视觉前缀用于随机选择任务，然后评估这些前缀在目标模型上的可转移性，产生严格的p值来量化相关性证据。通过引入无关基线模型过滤通用可转移特征来减少误报。

Result: 在LLM和VLM上的实验表明，RSP对相关模型产生小p值，对无关模型保持高p值。广泛的消融研究进一步证明了RSP的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: RSP是第一个原则性的通用统计框架，用于模型相关性检测，能够在现代机器学习生态系统中实现透明和可解释的决策。

Abstract: The growing prevalence of large language models (LLMs) and vision-language
models (VLMs) has heightened the need for reliable techniques to determine
whether a model has been fine-tuned from or is even identical to another.
Existing similarity-based methods often require access to model parameters or
produce heuristic scores without principled thresholds, limiting their
applicability. We introduce Random Selection Probing (RSP), a
hypothesis-testing framework that formulates model correlation detection as a
statistical test. RSP optimizes textual or visual prefixes on a reference model
for a random selection task and evaluates their transferability to a target
model, producing rigorous p-values that quantify evidence of correlation. To
mitigate false positives, RSP incorporates an unrelated baseline model to
filter out generic, transferable features. We evaluate RSP across both LLMs and
VLMs under diverse access conditions for reference models and test models.
Experiments on fine-tuned and open-source models show that RSP consistently
yields small p-values for related models while maintaining high p-values for
unrelated ones. Extensive ablation studies further demonstrate the robustness
of RSP. These results establish RSP as the first principled and general
statistical framework for model correlation detection, enabling transparent and
interpretable decisions in modern machine learning ecosystems.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FM-FoG是一个基于基础模型的实时可穿戴系统，可在无需患者特定训练的情况下检测帕金森病患者的冻结步态，在未见过的患者中达到98.5%的F1分数，并在智能手机上实现72%的电池续航提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 冻结步态影响超过50%的中晚期帕金森病患者，显著损害患者行动独立性和生活质量。现有检测系统需要大量患者特定训练数据且缺乏泛化能力，限制了临床部署。

Method: 结合自监督预训练和传感器上下文集成，使用轻量级CNN-LSTM活动分类器仅在行走或站立时激活基础模型，避免不必要计算。

Result: 在23名PD患者的VCU FoG-IMU数据集上，FM-FoG在未见过的患者中达到98.5%的F1分数，显著优于竞争基线方法。在Google Pixel 8a智能手机上部署，系统电池续航提升达72%，同时保持低于20ms的干预延迟。

Conclusion: FM-FoG能够实现实用、节能的医疗应用，无需个体训练要求即可跨患者泛化。

Abstract: Freezing-of-Gait (FoG) affects over 50% of mid-to-late stage Parkinson's
disease (PD) patients, significantly impairing patients' mobility independence
and reducing quality of life. FoG is characterized by sudden episodes where
walking cannot start or is interrupted, occurring exclusively during standing
or walking, and never while sitting or lying down. Current FoG detection
systems require extensive patient-specific training data and lack
generalization, limiting clinical deployment. To address these issues, we
introduce FM-FoG, a real-time foundation model-based wearable system achieving
FoG detection in unseen patients without patient-specific training. Our
approach combines self-supervised pretraining on diverse Inertial Measurement
Unit (IMU) datasets with sensor context integration. Since FoG occurs only
during ambulatory activities, a lightweight CNN-LSTM activity classifier
selectively activates the foundation model only during walking or standing,
avoiding unnecessary computation. Evaluated on the VCU FoG-IMU dataset with 23
PD patients, FM-FoG achieves a 98.5% F1-score when tested on previously unseen
patients, substantially outperforming competitive baseline methods. Deployed on
a Google Pixel 8a smartphone, the system extends battery life by up to 72%
while maintaining sub-20ms intervention latency. The results indicate that our
FM-FoG can enable practical, energy-efficient healthcare applications that
generalize across patients without individual training requirements.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文发现Wasserstein神经元在大型语言模型中起着关键作用，这些神经元通过负预激活空间的差异化处理来区分相似输入，特别是对句法标记的处理至关重要。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究大型语言模型中一类特殊的纠缠神经元（Wasserstein神经元）的功能机制，这些神经元虽然数量很少但对模型性能至关重要。

Method: 通过有针对性的移除实验、符号特异性干预（将负预激活归零）、词性分析和分层干预等方法，研究Wasserstein神经元在语法处理中的作用。

Result: 针对Wasserstein神经元负预激活的干预显著削弱了模型功能并破坏了语法行为，而随机和困惑度匹配的控制组对语法性能影响很小。词性分析显示异常主要出现在句法支架标记上。

Conclusion: 负差异化在稀疏的纠缠神经元子集中是语言模型依赖的关键机制，用于处理语法结构。

Abstract: A recently discovered class of entangled neurons, known as Wasserstein
neurons, is disproportionately critical in large language models despite
constituting only a very small fraction of the network: their targeted removal
collapses the model, consistent with their unique role in differentiating
similar inputs. Interestingly, in Wasserstein neurons immediately preceding
smooth activation functions, such differentiation manifests in the negative
pre-activation space, especially in early layers. Pairs of similar inputs are
driven to highly distinct negative values, and these pairs involve syntactic
tokens such as determiners and prepositions. We show that this negative region
is functional rather than simply favorable for optimization. A minimal,
sign-specific intervention that zeroes only the negative pre-activations of a
small subset of entangled neurons significantly weakens overall model function
and disrupts grammatical behavior, while both random and perplexity-matched
controls leave grammatical performance largely unchanged. Part of speech
analysis localizes the excess surprisal to syntactic scaffolding tokens, and
layer-specific interventions reveal that small local degradations accumulate
across depth. Over training checkpoints, the same ablation impairs grammatical
behavior as Wasserstein neurons emerge and stabilize. Together, these results
identify negative differentiation in a sparse subset of entangled neurons as a
crucial mechanism that language models rely on for syntax.

Result: 通过理论分析和实证研究验证了所提原则的有效性，为LLM的离策略RL提供了新的算法设计机会。

Conclusion: REINFORCE类算法天然支持离策略解释，提出的原则为LLM的离策略RL提供了理论基础和实用指导。

Abstract: Off-policy reinforcement learning (RL) for large language models (LLMs) is
attracting growing interest, driven by practical constraints in real-world
applications, the complexity of LLM-RL infrastructure, and the need for further
innovations of RL methodologies. While classic REINFORCE and its modern
variants like Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) are typically regarded
as on-policy algorithms with limited tolerance of off-policyness, we present in
this work a first-principles derivation for group-relative REINFORCE without
assuming a specific training data distribution, showing that it admits a native
off-policy interpretation. This perspective yields two general principles for
adapting REINFORCE to off-policy settings: regularizing policy updates, and
actively shaping the data distribution. Our analysis demystifies some myths
about the roles of importance sampling and clipping in GRPO, unifies and
reinterprets two recent algorithms -- Online Policy Mirror Descent (OPMD) and
Asymmetric REINFORCE (AsymRE) -- as regularized forms of the REINFORCE loss,
and offers theoretical justification for seemingly heuristic data-weighting
strategies. Our findings lead to actionable insights that are validated with
extensive empirical studies, and open up new opportunities for principled
algorithm design in off-policy RL for LLMs. Source code for this work is

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MDD-Thinker是一个基于大语言模型的抑郁症诊断框架，通过监督微调和强化学习增强推理能力，在UK Biobank数据集上训练，显著优于传统方法和通用LLM。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前抑郁症诊断主要依赖主观评估，缺乏多模态临床信息整合能力。LLM有潜力提升诊断准确性，但面临可解释性、幻觉和依赖合成数据等挑战。

Method: 开发MDD-Thinker框架，结合监督微调和强化学习增强推理能力。使用UK Biobank数据集生成40,000个推理样本，补充10,000个公开心理健康数据集样本。与机器学习、深度学习和最先进LLM基线进行比较评估。

Result: MDD-Thinker达到0.8268准确率和0.8081 F1分数，显著优于SVM、MLP和通用LLM。结合SFT和RL带来最大改进：准确率提升29.0%，F1分数提升38.1%，AUC提升34.8%。推理性能与更大LLM相当，同时保持计算效率。

Conclusion: 这是首个基于大规模真实世界临床数据的推理增强LLM抑郁症诊断框架。MDD-Thinker平衡了准确性、可解释性和效率，为智能精神科诊断提供了可扩展方法，表明推理导向的LLM可为抑郁症检测提供临床可靠支持。

Abstract: Background Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a leading cause of global
disability, yet current diagnostic approaches often rely on subjective
assessments and lack the ability to integrate multimodal clinical information.
Large language models (LLMs) hold promise for enhancing diagnostic accuracy
through advanced reasoning but face challenges in interpretability,
hallucination, and reliance on synthetic data.
  Methods We developed MDD-Thinker, an LLM-based diagnostic framework that
integrates supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with reinforcement learning (RL) to
strengthen reasoning ability and interpretability. Using the UK Biobank
dataset, we generated 40,000 reasoning samples, supplemented with 10,000
samples from publicly available mental health datasets. The model was
fine-tuned on these reasoning corpora, and its diagnostic and reasoning
performance was evaluated against machine learning, deep learning, and
state-of-the-art LLM baselines.
  Findings MDD-Thinker achieved an accuracy of 0.8268 and F1-score of 0.8081,
significantly outperforming traditional baselines such as SVM and MLP, as well
as general-purpose LLMs. Incorporating both SFT and RL yielded the greatest
improvements, with relative gains of 29.0% in accuracy, 38.1% in F1-score, and
34.8% in AUC. Moreover, the model demonstrated comparable reasoning performance
compared to much larger LLMs, while maintaining computational efficiency.
  Interpretation This study presents the first reasoning-enhanced LLM framework
for MDD diagnosis trained on large-scale real-world clinical data. By
integrating SFT and RL, MDD-Thinker balances accuracy, interpretability, and
efficiency, offering a scalable approach for intelligent psychiatric
diagnostics. These findings suggest that reasoning-oriented LLMs can provide
clinically reliable support for MDD detection and may inform broader
applications in mental health care.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了Conda优化器，结合了Adam的坐标自适应性和Muon的谱归一化优势，在LLaMA和GPT-2系列上实现2-2.5倍于AdamW的收敛速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Adam优化器虽然收敛快，但存在谱条件差和低秩结构问题，影响训练效率；Muon通过全局谱归一化解决了谱问题但缺乏坐标自适应。需要结合两者优势。

Method: Conda将更新投影到正交子空间，并基于投影梯度应用列级二阶矩归一化，既改善谱条件又保持坐标自适应。

Result: 在LLaMA和GPT-2系列预训练中，Conda始终优于AdamW、Muon等基线方法，在LLaMA上达到AdamW 2-2.5倍的收敛速度。

Conclusion: Conda是一个高效且广泛适用的大规模LLM训练优化器，解决了Adam的谱病理问题同时保持快速收敛特性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive generalization and
emergent capabilities, yet their pre-training remains computationally expensive
and sensitive to optimization dynamics. While Adam-based optimizers offer fast
convergence by adapting learning rates coordinate-wise, recent studies reveal
that their updates often suffer from poor spectral conditioning and low-rank
structures, hindering efficiency. Muon addresses this issue via global spectral
normalization but lacks the per-coordinate adaptivity of Adam. In this work, we
propose \textbf{Column-Normalized Adam (Conda)}, a novel optimizer that bridges
the strengths of both approaches. Conda projects updates into an orthogonal
subspace and applies column-wise second moment normalization based on the
projected gradients, thereby achieving both improved spectral conditioning and
maintaining coordinate-wise adaptivity. This design alleviates the spectral
pathologies of Adam while preserving its fast convergence behavior. Extensive
experiments on the LLaMA and GPT-2 series show that Conda consistently
outperforms AdamW, Muon, and other baselines in pre-training. Remarkably, on
the LLaMA series, \textbf{Conda achieves $2{\sim}2.5\times$ the convergence
speed of AdamW, measured in both training steps and training time.} Further
ablations demonstrate its robustness under diverse training setups. These
results collectively highlight Conda as an effective and broadly applicable
optimizer for large-scale LLM training. The code is released on

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图像编辑方法常常扭曲细节或引入伪影，需要一种能够保持视觉相似性同时实现语义编辑的方法。

Method: 使用耦合SDEs，通过驱动源图像和编辑图像使用相同的相关噪声，引导采样过程向期望语义发展。

Result: 方法无需重新训练或辅助网络，实现了高提示保真度和接近像素级的视觉一致性。

Conclusion: 耦合SDEs是受控生成AI的简单而强大的工具。

Abstract: Editing the content of an image with a pretrained text-to-image model remains
challenging. Existing methods often distort fine details or introduce
unintended artifacts. We propose using coupled stochastic differential
equations (coupled SDEs) to guide the sampling process of any pre-trained
generative model that can be sampled by solving an SDE, including diffusion and
rectified flow models. By driving both the source image and the edited image
with the same correlated noise, our approach steers new samples toward the
desired semantics while preserving visual similarity to the source. The method
works out-of-the-box-without retraining or auxiliary networks-and achieves high
prompt fidelity along with near-pixel-level consistency. These results position
coupled SDEs as a simple yet powerful tool for controlled generative AI.

Abstract: The integration of machine learning (ML) is critical for industrial
competitiveness, yet its adoption is frequently stalled by the prohibitive
costs and operational disruptions of upgrading legacy systems. The financial
and logistical overhead required to support the full ML lifecycle presents a
formidable barrier to widespread implementation, particularly for small and
medium-sized enterprises. This paper introduces a pragmatic, API-based
framework designed to overcome these challenges by strategically decoupling the
ML model lifecycle from the production environment. Our solution delivers the
analytical power of ML to domain experts through a lightweight, browser-based
interface, eliminating the need for local hardware upgrades and ensuring model
maintenance can occur with zero production downtime. This human-in-the-loop
approach empowers experts with interactive control over model parameters,
fostering trust and facilitating seamless integration into existing workflows.
By mitigating the primary financial and operational risks, this framework
offers a scalable and accessible pathway to enhance production quality and
safety, thereby strengthening the competitive advantage of the manufacturing
sector.

Result: 创建了可访问、现实和公平的PU学习评估框架，能够进行算法间的公平比较。

Conclusion: 该基准为未来PU学习算法的评估提供了标准化环境，解决了现有评估中的关键问题。

Abstract: Positive-unlabeled (PU) learning is a weakly supervised binary classification
problem, in which the goal is to learn a binary classifier from only positive
and unlabeled data, without access to negative data. In recent years, many PU
learning algorithms have been developed to improve model performance. However,
experimental settings are highly inconsistent, making it difficult to identify
which algorithm performs better. In this paper, we propose the first PU
learning benchmark to systematically compare PU learning algorithms. During our
implementation, we identify subtle yet critical factors that affect the
realistic and fair evaluation of PU learning algorithms. On the one hand, many
PU learning algorithms rely on a validation set that includes negative data for
model selection. This is unrealistic in traditional PU learning settings, where
no negative data are available. To handle this problem, we systematically
investigate model selection criteria for PU learning. On the other hand, the
problem settings and solutions of PU learning have different families, i.e.,
the one-sample and two-sample settings. However, existing evaluation protocols
are heavily biased towards the one-sample setting and neglect the significant
difference between them. We identify the internal label shift problem of
unlabeled training data for the one-sample setting and propose a simple yet
effective calibration approach to ensure fair comparisons within and across
families. We hope our framework will provide an accessible, realistic, and fair
environment for evaluating PU learning algorithms in the future.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了ChessArena测试平台来评估大语言模型的战略推理能力，通过国际象棋对弈测试发现当前LLMs在复杂战略推理方面存在显著不足，即使微调后的模型也仅能达到业余人类水平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估大语言模型是否真正具备复杂战略推理能力，还是仅仅擅长训练数据中的模式识别，特别是针对需要长期规划、严格规则理解和多轮对话记忆的战略推理任务。

Method: 构建ChessArena竞争性测试框架，让LLMs在四种不同游戏模式下相互对弈，配备排名算法和排行榜，评估基本理解、走子选择和谜题解决等细粒度能力。

Result: 测试了13个LLMs的800多场对局，结果显示当前模型都无法击败业余人类水平的Maia-1100，有些甚至输给随机走子的玩家。微调的Qwen3-8B性能大幅提升，接近更大规模的先进推理模型。

Conclusion: 当前大语言模型在复杂战略推理方面仍存在显著局限性，需要进一步改进才能真正具备类似人类的战略推理能力。

Abstract: Recent large language models (LLMs) have shown strong reasoning capabilities.
However, a critical question remains: do these models possess genuine reasoning
skills particularly complex strategic reasoning or are they primarily excelling
at sophisticated pattern recognition within their training data? To address
this question, this paper presents a chess testbed, ChessArena, to evaluate the
strategic reasoning capabilities of LLMs. Chess requires complex strategic
reasoning capabilities including long-term planning, strict rule comprehension,
and multi-turn conversation memorization. Specifically, ChessArena is a
competitive framework where LLMs play against each other, under four different
play modes. The testbed is equipped with a ranking algorithm and a leaderboard.
The testbed can also evaluate fine-grained capabilities including basic
understanding, move selection, and puzzle solving. Over 13 LLMs with different
modes are evaluated in ChessArena, playing over 800 games. The results reveal
significant shortcomings in current LLMs: no model can beat Maia-1100 (a chess
engine at human amateur level), while some even failed to defeat a random
player that selects moves arbitrarily. We also present a strong baseline to the
testbed: our fine-tuned Qwen3-8B substantially improved performance,
approaching much larger state-of-the-art reasoning models.

Conclusion: 这项工作建立了将预训练-迁移框架适应于图优化的新范式，为将基础模型创新应用于运筹学打开了大门。

Abstract: The pretrain-transfer paradigm, which underpins the success of large language
models (LLMs), has demonstrated the immense power of creating foundation models
that learn generalizable representations from vast datasets. However, extending
this paradigm to Operations Research (OR) problems on graph structures remains
challenging due to the fundamental conflict between the statistical flexibility
of language and the strict combinatorial constraints of graphs. To bridge this
gap, we introduce the Graph Foundation Model (GFM), the first framework capable
of solving all distance-based optimization problems on graph structures. By
introducing the LLM-like self-supervised pre-training paradigm on the paths
generated from random walks in the graph, GFM is compelled to internalize the
graph's complex topological and combinatorial rules, where the connectivity of
the structure itself can be treated as the supervisory signal. Unlike existing
neural methods that learn complex and task-specific solving policies, our
approach leverages the pre-trained GFM as a foundational model of the graph's
intrinsic structure, which in turn enables a simple generative heuristic to
tackle a diverse range of optimization challenges effectively. Comprehensive
experiments on networks ranging from 20 to 893 nodes demonstrate that GFM
achieves competitive performance against specialized solvers across a variety
of distinct optimization task classes, while maintaining significantly faster
inference times. Our work establishes a new paradigm of adapting the
pretrain-transfer framework to graph optimization, opening the door for
applying foundation model innovations to OR.

Result: 实验表明该框架成功模拟了自适应作弊行为，能够策略性地平衡奖励优化和检测规避。

Conclusion: 该工作为研究自适应作弊行为和开发有效作弊检测器提供了一个可控且可扩展的平台。

Abstract: Extra-Sensory Perception (ESP) cheats, which reveal hidden in-game
information such as enemy locations, are difficult to detect because their
effects are not directly observable in player behavior. The lack of observable
evidence makes it difficult to collect reliably labeled data, which is
essential for training effective anti-cheat systems. Furthermore, cheaters
often adapt their behavior by limiting or disguising their cheat usage, which
further complicates detection and detector development. To address these
challenges, we propose a simulation framework for controlled modeling of ESP
cheaters, non-cheaters, and trajectory-based detectors. We model cheaters and
non-cheaters as reinforcement learning agents with different levels of
observability, while detectors classify their behavioral trajectories. Next, we
formulate the interaction between the cheater and the detector as an
adversarial game, allowing both players to co-adapt over time. To reflect
realistic cheater strategies, we introduce a structured cheater model that
dynamically switches between cheating and non-cheating behaviors based on
detection risk. Experiments demonstrate that our framework successfully
simulates adaptive cheater behaviors that strategically balance reward
optimization and detection evasion. This work provides a controllable and
extensible platform for studying adaptive cheating behaviors and developing
effective cheat detectors.

Abstract: Recent advances in electroencephalography (EEG) foundation models, which
capture transferable EEG representations, have greatly accelerated the
development of brain-computer interfaces (BCI). However, existing approaches
still struggle to incorporate language instructions as prior constraints for
EEG representation learning, limiting their ability to leverage the semantic
knowledge inherent in language to unify different labels and tasks. To address
this challenge, we present ELASTIQ, a foundation model for EEG-Language
Alignment with Semantic Task Instruction and Querying. ELASTIQ integrates
task-aware semantic guidance to produce structured and linguistically aligned
EEG embeddings, thereby enhancing decoding robustness and transferability. In
the pretraining stage, we introduce a joint Spectral-Temporal Reconstruction
(STR) module, which combines frequency masking as a global spectral
perturbation with two complementary temporal objectives: random masking to
capture contextual dependencies and causal masking to model sequential
dynamics. In the instruction tuning stage, we propose the
Instruction-conditioned Q-Former (IQF), a query-based cross-attention
transformer that injects instruction embeddings into EEG tokens and aligns them
with textual label embeddings through learnable queries. We evaluate ELASTIQ on
20 datasets spanning motor imagery, emotion recognition, steady-state visual
evoked potentials, covert speech, and healthcare tasks. ELASTIQ achieves
state-of-the-art performance on 14 of the 20 datasets and obtains the best
average results across all five task categories. Importantly, our analyses
reveal for the first time that explicit task instructions serve as semantic
priors guiding EEG embeddings into coherent and linguistically grounded spaces.
The code and pre-trained weights will be released.

TL;DR: 本研究探索了基于通用微分方程的科学机器学习框架来预测土壤有机碳动态，在无噪声和中等噪声条件下表现良好，但在高噪声环境下存在过拟合问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 土壤有机碳是土壤健康和全球气候韧性的基础，但由于复杂的物理、化学和生物过程，其预测仍然困难。

Method: 使用通用微分方程框架，将机械物理（如平流扩散传输）与学习非线性微生物生产和呼吸的神经网络相结合，通过合成数据集系统评估了六个实验案例。

Result: 在无噪声和7%噪声条件下表现优异（MSE=1.6e-5，R2=0.9999；MSE=3.4e-6，R2=0.99998），但在35%高噪声条件下出现过拟合（R2=0.94）或过度平滑问题（负R2）。

Conclusion: 通用微分方程适用于可扩展、噪声容忍的土壤有机碳预测，但需要噪声感知损失函数、概率建模和更紧密的微生物动力学集成来推进实地部署。

Abstract: Soil Organic Carbon (SOC) is a foundation of soil health and global climate
resilience, yet its prediction remains difficult because of intricate physical,
chemical, and biological processes. In this study, we explore a Scientific
Machine Learning (SciML) framework built on Universal Differential Equations
(UDEs) to forecast SOC dynamics across soil depth and time. UDEs blend
mechanistic physics, such as advection diffusion transport, with neural
networks that learn nonlinear microbial production and respiration. Using
synthetic datasets, we systematically evaluated six experimental cases,
progressing from clean, noise free benchmarks to stress tests with high (35%)
multiplicative, spatially correlated noise. Our results highlight both the
potential and limitations of the approach. In noise free and moderate noise
settings, the UDE accurately reconstructed SOC dynamics. In clean terminal
profile at 50 years (Case 4) achieved near perfect fidelity, with MSE = 1.6e-5,
and R2 = 0.9999. Case 5, with 7% noise, remained robust (MSE = 3.4e-6, R2 =
0.99998), capturing depth wise SOC trends while tolerating realistic
measurement uncertainty. In contrast, Case 3 (35% noise at t = 0) showed clear
evidence of overfitting: the model reproduced noisy inputs with high accuracy
but lost generalization against the clean truth (R2 = 0.94). Case 6 (35% noise
at t = 50) collapsed toward overly smooth mean profiles, failing to capture
depth wise variability and yielding negative R2, underscoring the limits of
standard training under severe uncertainty. These findings suggest that UDEs
are well suited for scalable, noise tolerant SOC forecasting, though advancing
toward field deployment will require noise aware loss functions, probabilistic
modelling, and tighter integration of microbial dynamics.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SALT提出了一种两阶段无正则化训练方法，使用固定教师模型替代EMA更新，在视频表示学习中实现了更高的计算效率和可扩展性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: V-JEPA架构中的EMA更新虽然防止了表示崩溃，但增加了模型选择的复杂性并耦合了师生架构。研究旨在简化训练过程，提高透明度和效率。

Method: 两阶段训练：第一阶段用像素重建目标训练教师编码器，第二阶段冻结教师，训练学生预测教师潜在表示中的掩码区域。

Result: SALT在多个基准测试中优于V-JEPA 2编码器，计算效率更高，缩放曲线主导了准确率-FLOPs帕累托前沿，且学生对教师质量具有鲁棒性。

Conclusion: SALT为基于EMA的自蒸馏提供了一种简单、可扩展且计算高效的替代方案，建议将计算预算主要分配给学生训练。

Abstract: Video Joint Embedding Predictive Architectures (V-JEPA) learn generalizable
off-the-shelf video representation by predicting masked regions in latent space
with an exponential moving average (EMA)-updated teacher. While EMA prevents
representation collapse, it complicates scalable model selection and couples
teacher and student architectures. We revisit masked-latent prediction and show
that a frozen teacher suffices. Concretely, we (i) train a target encoder with
a simple pixel-reconstruction objective under V-JEPA masking, then (ii) freeze
it and train a student to predict the teacher's latents on masked regions. This
leads to a two-stage, unregularized scheme that we refer to as SALT
(Static-teacher Asymmetric Latent Training). SALT decouples optimization into
pixel reconstruction (teacher) and masked latent prediction (student),
increasing transparency, efficiency, and scalability while preserving the
ability of representation to generalize under frozen evaluation. Empirically,
our student models outperform recently proposed V-JEPA 2 encoders under frozen
backbone evaluation across diverse benchmarks. They are also more
compute-optimal: at matched pretraining FLOPs, our method achieves higher
probing accuracy, and its scaling curves dominate V-JEPA's accuracy-FLOPs
Pareto frontier. Finally, we find that student quality is remarkably robust to
teacher quality: high-performing students emerge even with small, sub-optimal
teachers. This points to a compute budget allocation that should overwhelmingly
favor the student. These results position SALT as a simple, scalable, and
compute-efficient alternative to EMA-based self-distillation for video
representation learning.

TL;DR: 提出AuON优化器，通过非线性缩放和归一化实现线性时间复杂度的正交梯度更新，避免了传统O(n^3)正交化方法的高计算成本，性能与AdamW和Muon相当。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统正交梯度更新方法计算成本高(O(n^3))且性能不如带动量的SGD，现有改进方法如Muon仍存在二次复杂度瓶颈。

Method: 通过谱范数信任区域限制动量更新，结合双曲余弦RMS缩放变换和归一化，避免显式半正交化，实现线性时间复杂度。

Result: 在视觉和语言基准测试中，AuON及其混合变体性能与AdamW和Muon等强基线相当。

Conclusion: AuON提供了一种计算高效的正交梯度更新方法，在保持性能的同时显著降低了计算复杂度。

Abstract: Orthogonal gradient updates have emerged as a promising direction in
optimization for machine learning. However, traditional approaches such as
SVD/QR decomposition incur prohibitive computational costs of O(n^3) and
underperform compared to well-tuned SGD with momentum, since momentum is
applied only after strict orthogonalization. Recent advances, such as Muon,
improve efficiency by applying momentum before orthogonalization and producing
semi-orthogonal matrices via Newton-Schulz iterations, reducing complexity to
O(n^2). Nevertheless, quadratic costs remain a bottleneck.
  In this work, we study the semi-orthogonal properties of momentum-based
updates and develop a method to bound momentum updates under a spectral-norm
trust region, preserving directional information without requiring explicit
semi-orthogonalization.
  We propose AuON (Alternative Unit-norm momentum updates by Normalized
nonlinear scaling), a linear-time optimizer that achieves strong performance
without constructing semi-orthogonal matrices, while preserving structural
alignment and reconditioning ill-posed updates. Our approach combines
hyperbolic-cosine RMS scaling transformations with normalization, demonstrating
both effectiveness and computational efficiency compared to Newton-Schulz
methods. We further introduce a hybrid variant (Hybrid-AuON) that applies a
single Newton-Schulz iteration. Experiments across vision and language
benchmarks show that AuON and its hybrid variant achieve performance comparable
to strong baselines such as AdamW and Muon.

Motivation: 联邦学习容易受到拜占庭攻击，而现有的相似性感知聚合方法需要依赖干净数据，限制了其在无干净数据场景下的应用。

Method: H+随机选择p维参数向量中的r维段，应用相似性检查函数H与参考向量比较，保留最相似的客户端向量进行聚合，重复K次以有效识别诚实客户端。

Conclusion: H+不仅在有干净数据时优于现有方法，还扩展了在无干净数据联邦学习系统中的应用，同时保持较低的计算复杂度。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables decentralized model training without sharing
raw data. However, it remains vulnerable to Byzantine attacks, which can
compromise the aggregation of locally updated parameters at the central server.
Similarity-aware aggregation has emerged as an effective strategy to mitigate
such attacks by identifying and filtering out malicious clients based on
similarity between client model parameters and those derived from clean data,
i.e., data that is uncorrupted and trustworthy. However, existing methods adopt
this strategy only in FL systems with clean data, making them inapplicable to
settings where such data is unavailable. In this paper, we propose H+, a novel
similarity-aware aggregation approach that not only outperforms existing
methods in scenarios with clean data, but also extends applicability to FL
systems without any clean data. Specifically, H+ randomly selects
$r$-dimensional segments from the $p$-dimensional parameter vectors uploaded to
the server and applies a similarity check function $H$ to compare each segment
against a reference vector, preserving the most similar client vectors for
aggregation. The reference vector is derived either from existing robust
algorithms when clean data is unavailable or directly from clean data.
Repeating this process $K$ times enables effective identification of honest
clients. Moreover, H+ maintains low computational complexity, with an
analytical time complexity of $\mathcal{O}(KMr)$, where $M$ is the number of
clients and $Kr \ll p$. Comprehensive experiments validate H+ as a
state-of-the-art (SOTA) method, demonstrating substantial robustness
improvements over existing approaches under varying Byzantine attack ratios and
multiple types of traditional Byzantine attacks, across all evaluated scenarios
and benchmark datasets.

TL;DR: 提出了iMOOE方法，通过物理引导的不变学习来解决PDE系统在未知分布场景下的零样本泛化问题，该方法基于PDE不变性原理，包含不变性对齐的专家混合架构和频率增强学习目标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实物理环境中的PDE系统参数多变，如何在有限训练数据下实现跨未见分布场景的泛化至关重要。现有方法在零样本OOD泛化能力上仍有不足，需要额外的测试时样本进行领域适应。

Method: 首先明确定义了PDE的两重不变性原理，然后提出了iMOOE方法，包含不变性对齐的算子专家混合架构和频率增强的不变学习目标。

Result: 在模拟基准和实际应用中验证了iMOOE在分布内性能和零样本泛化能力上的优越性，能够应对多样化的OOD预测场景。

Conclusion: iMOOE通过捕捉PDE系统的基本物理不变性，显著提升了在未见分布场景下的零样本泛化能力，为物理动力学预测提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Advanced deep learning-based approaches have been actively applied to
forecast the spatiotemporal physical dynamics governed by partial differential
equations (PDEs), which acts as a critical procedure in tackling many science
and engineering problems. As real-world physical environments like PDE system
parameters are always capricious, how to generalize across unseen
out-of-distribution (OOD) forecasting scenarios using limited training data is
of great importance. To bridge this barrier, existing methods focus on
discovering domain-generalizable representations across various PDE dynamics
trajectories. However, their zero-shot OOD generalization capability remains
deficient, since extra test-time samples for domain-specific adaptation are
still required. This is because the fundamental physical invariance in PDE
dynamical systems are yet to be investigated or integrated. To this end, we
first explicitly define a two-fold PDE invariance principle, which points out
that ingredient operators and their composition relationships remain invariant
across different domains and PDE system evolution. Next, to capture this
two-fold PDE invariance, we propose a physics-guided invariant learning method
termed iMOOE, featuring an Invariance-aligned Mixture Of Operator Expert
architecture and a frequency-enriched invariant learning objective. Extensive
experiments across simulated benchmarks and real-world applications validate
iMOOE's superior in-distribution performance and zero-shot generalization
capabilities on diverse OOD forecasting scenarios.

Motivation: 现有游戏关卡生成方法往往无法全面评估多维多样性指标，这些指标之间存在冲突、互补或混合关系，限制了游戏体验的丰富性和参与度。

Method: 将模型训练构建为多目标学习问题，每个多样性指标被视为独立目标，并提出多目标进化学习框架在模型训练过程中同时优化多个多样性指标。

Result: 在超级马里奥兄弟基准测试中，该框架成功提升了多维多样性，并识别出生成模型的帕累托前沿，提供了可玩性与两个代表性多样性指标（基于内容的和玩家中心的）之间的权衡范围。

Conclusion: 该框架使决策者能够根据各种场景以及玩家和设计师的多样化需求，在生成器选择时做出明智决策。

Abstract: In recent years, the generation of diverse game levels has gained increasing
interest, contributing to a richer and more engaging gaming experience. A
number of level diversity metrics have been proposed in literature, which are
naturally multi-dimensional, leading to conflicted, complementary, or both
relationships among these dimensions. However, existing level generation
approaches often fail to comprehensively assess diversity across those
dimensions. This paper aims to expand horizons of level diversity by
considering multi-dimensional diversity when training generative models. We
formulate the model training as a multi-objective learning problem, where each
diversity metric is treated as a distinct objective. Furthermore, a
multi-objective evolutionary learning framework that optimises multiple
diversity metrics simultaneously throughout the model training process is
proposed. Our case study on the commonly used benchmark Super Mario Bros.
demonstrates that our proposed framework can enhance multi-dimensional
diversity and identify a Pareto front of generative models, which provides a
range of tradeoffs among playability and two representative diversity metrics,
including a content-based one and a player-centered one. Such capability
enables decision-makers to make informed choices when selecting generators
accommodating a variety of scenarios and the diverse needs of players and
designers.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了首个针对扩散语言模型(DLMs)的水印方案，解决了传统自回归语言模型水印方法无法直接应用于DLMs的问题，通过期望上下文和提升水印强度的方法实现了可靠的水印检测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散语言模型(DLMs)作为一种新兴的LLM范式，能够以任意顺序生成token，这与标准自回归语言模型(ARLMs)的顺序生成方式不同。现有的ARLM水印方案依赖于先前生成的token，这在DLM生成中并不总是可用，因此需要专门为DLMs设计水印方案。

Method: 通过两种方法解决DLM水印挑战：(1)在上下文token尚未确定时，在期望上应用水印；(2)提升那些作为其他token上下文时能增加水印强度的token。同时保持水印检测器不变。

Result: 实验评估表明，DLM水印实现了>99%的真阳性率，对质量影响极小，并且达到了与现有ARLM水印相似的鲁棒性，首次实现了可靠的DLM水印。

Conclusion: 该研究成功开发了首个专门针对扩散语言模型的水印方案，解决了传统水印方法在DLM环境中的适用性问题，为DLMs的可靠水印提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: We introduce the first watermark tailored for diffusion language models
(DLMs), an emergent LLM paradigm able to generate tokens in arbitrary order, in
contrast to standard autoregressive language models (ARLMs) which generate
tokens sequentially. While there has been much work in ARLM watermarking, a key
challenge when attempting to apply these schemes directly to the DLM setting is
that they rely on previously generated tokens, which are not always available
with DLM generation. In this work we address this challenge by: (i) applying
the watermark in expectation over the context even when some context tokens are
yet to be determined, and (ii) promoting tokens which increase the watermark
strength when used as context for other tokens. This is accomplished while
keeping the watermark detector unchanged. Our experimental evaluation
demonstrates that the DLM watermark leads to a >99% true positive rate with
minimal quality impact and achieves similar robustness to existing ARLM
watermarks, enabling for the first time reliable DLM watermarking.

TL;DR: 本文成功将进化策略（ES）扩展到大规模语言模型（LLM）的完整参数微调，证明ES在数十亿参数规模下仍能高效搜索，并在多个方面优于强化学习（RL）微调方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管进化策略（ES）曾在百万参数模型上表现出与强化学习（RL）相当的性能，但由于对其可扩展性的悲观预期，在LLM微调中被忽视。本研究旨在重新评估ES在大规模LLM微调中的潜力。

Method: 使用进化策略（ES）方法对预训练大型语言模型的全部参数进行微调，突破了传统认为ES无法扩展到数十亿参数规模的限制。

Result: ES在数十亿参数规模下表现出高效搜索能力，在样本效率、长周期奖励容忍度、对不同基础LLM的鲁棒性、奖励破解倾向性以及跨运行稳定性等多个方面优于现有RL微调方法。

Conclusion: 进化策略为LLM微调开辟了超越当前RL技术的新方向，证明了ES在大规模参数优化中的有效性和实用性。

Abstract: Fine-tuning pre-trained large language models (LLMs) for down-stream tasks is
a critical step in the AI deployment pipeline. Reinforcement learning (RL) is
arguably the most prominent fine-tuning method, contributing to the birth of
many state-of-the-art LLMs. In contrast, evolution strategies (ES), which once
showed comparable performance to RL on models with a few million parameters,
was neglected due to the pessimistic perception of its scalability to larger
models. In this work, we report the first successful attempt to scale up ES for
fine-tuning the full parameters of LLMs, showing the surprising fact that ES
can search efficiently over billions of parameters and outperform existing RL
fine-tuning methods in multiple respects, including sample efficiency,
tolerance to long-horizon rewards, robustness to different base LLMs, less
tendency to reward hacking, and more stable performance across runs. It
therefore serves as a basis to unlock a new direction in LLM fine-tuning beyond
what current RL techniques provide. The source codes are provided at:

TL;DR: AXIS框架通过为冻结的LLM提供三种互补提示来解决时间序列异常检测中的解释性问题，包括符号数值提示、上下文集成的时间序列编码器提示和任务先验提示，显著提升了异常解释质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于LLM的时间序列异常检测方法面临连续信号难以直接处理的问题，朴素的时间到文本序列化缺乏上下文基础和表示对齐，需要更好的多模态对齐方法。

Method: AXIS框架不直接序列化时间序列，而是为冻结的LLM提供三种提示：符号数值提示用于数值基础、上下文集成的时间序列编码器提示捕捉细粒度动态、任务先验提示编码全局异常特征。

Result: 实验表明AXIS产生的解释质量显著更高，检测精度与通用LLM、专用时间序列LLM和时间序列视觉语言模型相比具有竞争力。

Conclusion: AXIS通过多提示条件化方法有效解决了时间序列与文本模态的对齐问题，为可解释的时间序列异常检测提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Time-series anomaly detection (TSAD) increasingly demands explanations that
articulate not only if an anomaly occurred, but also what pattern it exhibits
and why it is anomalous. Leveraging the impressive explanatory capabilities of
Large Language Models (LLMs), recent works have attempted to treat time series
as text for explainable TSAD. However, this approach faces a fundamental
challenge: LLMs operate on discrete tokens and struggle to directly process
long, continuous signals. Consequently, naive time-to-text serialization
suffers from a lack of contextual grounding and representation alignment
between the two modalities. To address this gap, we introduce AXIS, a framework
that conditions a frozen LLM for nuanced time-series understanding. Instead of
direct serialization, AXIS enriches the LLM's input with three complementary
hints derived from the series: (i) a symbolic numeric hint for numerical
grounding, (ii) a context-integrated, step-aligned hint distilled from a
pretrained time-series encoder to capture fine-grained dynamics, and (iii) a
task-prior hint that encodes global anomaly characteristics. Furthermore, to
facilitate robust evaluation of explainability, we introduce a new benchmark
featuring multi-format questions and rationales that supervise contextual
grounding and pattern-level semantics. Extensive experiments, including both
LLM-based and human evaluations, demonstrate that AXIS yields explanations of
significantly higher quality and achieves competitive detection accuracy
compared to general-purpose LLMs, specialized time-series LLMs, and time-series
Vision Language Models.

TL;DR: Muon优化器在小到中等规模解码器（30M-200M参数）训练中表现出色，提供理论收敛分析和实际效率提升，与AdamW相比节省48-52%训练计算量，结合MLA和MoE技术可获得68%内存减少和3.2倍推理加速。

Motivation: 研究Muon优化器在训练transformer解码器时的理论基础和实际性能，探索其与现代架构优化的协同效应，验证其在计算效率方面的优势。

Method: 提供严格的理论分析包括收敛率、谱正则化特性、Stiefel流形上的自然梯度下降连接、谱范数下的最速梯度下降等价性，并进行100+训练运行的稳定性分析和15种架构与优化器组件的详细评估。

Result: Muon使用48-52%的AdamW训练计算量达到目标损失，保持或改善最终困惑度；结合MLA+MoE时实现68%内存减少、3.2倍推理加速和8-12%困惑度改善；在大型批次训练中保持优越的数据效率。

Conclusion: Muon是基于原理的、稳健的AdamW替代方案，特别在与现代效率技术和大型批次训练方案结合时表现优异，扩展了计算-时间权衡的Pareto前沿。

Abstract: We present a comprehensive theoretical and empirical study of the Muon
optimizer for training transformers only with a small to medium decoder (30M -
200M parameters), with an emphasis on its mathematical foundations, convergence
properties and synergistic interactions with modern architectural
optimizations. Building on recent work showing Muon's scalability, we provide
rigorous theoretical analysis including: (i)showing the convergence rate under
standard assumptions, (ii) spectral regularization properties that prevent
gradient explosion, (iii) connection to natural gradient descent on the Stiefel
manifold, and (iv) equivalence to steepest gradient descent under the spectral
norm. Crucially, we demonstrate that Muon expands the Pareto frontier in the
compute-time trade-off by maintaining superior data efficiency at large batch
sizes, a key finding of~\cite{essentialai2025muon} that we validate across our
model scales. Empirically, Muon reaches the target loss with 48-52\% of the
training calculated by AdamW while maintaining or improving the final
perplexity, consistent with larger-scale results. When combined with Multi-Head
Latent Attention (MLA) and Mixture-of-Experts (MoE), we observe multiplicative
efficiency gains: MLA+MoE+Muon achieves 68\% memory reduction and 3.2$\times$
inference speedup, while improving perplexity by 8-12\%. We provide detailed
procedures on 15 architectural and optimizer components, stability analyzes
across 100+ training runs, and practical implementation guidelines including
Newton-Schulz coefficients $(3.4445, -4.7750, 2.0315)$ optimized
by~\cite{su2024muonblog}. Our theoretical analysis and comprehensive
experiments establish Muon as a principled, robust alternative to AdamW that
particularly excels when combined with modern efficiency techniques and
large-batch training regimes.

Conclusion: 通过理论证明最大化时间和拓扑视图之间的条件互信息可以提高跨视图一致性并增强更具区分性的表示，ScatterAD有效利用了表示分散现象来改进异常检测。

Abstract: One main challenge in time series anomaly detection for industrial IoT lies
in the complex spatio-temporal couplings within multivariate data. However,
traditional anomaly detection methods focus on modeling spatial or temporal
dependencies independently, resulting in suboptimal representation learning and
limited sensitivity to anomalous dispersion in high-dimensional spaces. In this
work, we conduct an empirical analysis showing that both normal and anomalous
samples tend to scatter in high-dimensional space, especially anomalous samples
are markedly more dispersed. We formalize this dispersion phenomenon as
scattering, quantified by the mean pairwise distance among sample
representations, and leverage it as an inductive signal to enhance
spatio-temporal anomaly detection. Technically, we propose ScatterAD to model
representation scattering across temporal and topological dimensions. ScatterAD
incorporates a topological encoder for capturing graph-structured scattering
and a temporal encoder for constraining over-scattering through mean squared
error minimization between neighboring time steps. We introduce a contrastive
fusion mechanism to ensure the complementarity of the learned temporal and
topological representations. Additionally, we theoretically show that
maximizing the conditional mutual information between temporal and topological
views improves cross-view consistency and enhances more discriminative
representations. Extensive experiments on multiple public benchmarks show that
ScatterAD achieves state-of-the-art performance on multivariate time series
anomaly detection. Code is available at this repository:

Method: 提出基于模态对齐的语义压缩方法，当模态间隙充分减小时，不同模态但表达相同语义的嵌入共享空间中的共同部分，因此可以用单个质心替换多个嵌入来实现压缩。该方法直接在预训练编码器上操作。

Result: 在多样化大规模多模态下游任务中验证了方法的有效性，实现了显著的压缩效果而不牺牲性能。

Conclusion: 模态对齐是实现语义压缩的关键推动因素，所提出的方法在保持性能的同时实现了显著的内存压缩。

Abstract: Multimodal representation learning produces high-dimensional embeddings that
align diverse modalities in a shared latent space. While this enables strong
generalization, it also introduces scalability challenges, both in terms of
storage and downstream processing. A key open problem is how to achieve
semantic compression, reducing the memory footprint of multimodal embeddings
while preserving their ability to represent shared semantic content across
modalities. In this paper, we prove a strong connection between reducing the
modality gap, which is the residual separation of embeddings from different
modalities, and the feasibility of post-training semantic compression. When the
gap is sufficiently reduced, embeddings from different modalities but
expressing the same semantics share a common portion of the space. Therefore,
their centroid is a faithful representation of such a semantic concept. This
enables replacing multiple embeddings with a single centroid, yielding
significant memory savings. We propose a novel approach for semantic
compression grounded on the latter intuition, operating directly on pretrained
encoders. We demonstrate its effectiveness across diverse large-scale
multimodal downstream tasks. Our results highlight that modality alignment is a
key enabler for semantic compression, showing that the proposed approach
achieves significant compression without sacrificing performance.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大语言模型训练内存需求高、模型体积大的问题，通过进化学习机制实现模型压缩和训练加速。

Method: 将模型划分为多个结构相同但参数不同的专家子网络，每个训练步骤只训练一个专家，结合AdamW优化和进化算子（交叉、粒子群优化、变异）来学习最佳专家的经验。

Result: 最佳专家能达到与完整模型几乎相同的精度，模型大小显著减小，训练吞吐量提升10倍以上，内存需求大幅降低。

Conclusion: 该进化训练框架能有效压缩大语言模型，在保持性能的同时实现高效的训练和推理，适合在PC和边缘设备上部署。

Abstract: This paper presents an evolutionary framework for the training of large
language models(LLM). The models are divided into several
experts(sub-networks), which have the same structure but different parameter
values. Only one expert is trained at each step. After the classical AdamW
optimization, some evolutionary operators(crossover, PSO, and mutation) act on
the tensor weights between the current expert and the best expert. So current
expert would learn the experience of best expert. The direction of best expert
would help current expert's loss decrease faster. Finally, only save the weight
of the best expert. Experiments show that best expert would achieve nearly the
same accuracy as the full model. This would greatly reduce the size of the
model for inference. Since only one expert is trained at each step, the
training needs much less memory and has much higher throughput. Experiments
show that the throughput would accelerate more than ten times! Our source code
is available. It's a pure c++/cu framework, which is suitable for easy
deployment on PCs and edge computing devices.

Conclusion: 所提出的方法在联邦学习环境中有效处理了数据分布扰动和异常值问题，通过不平衡Wasserstein距离和KL惩罚机制实现了分布鲁棒性和异常值鲁棒性的统一框架。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables collaborative model training without direct
data sharing, but its performance can degrade significantly in the presence of
data distribution perturbations. Distributionally robust optimization (DRO)
provides a principled framework for handling this by optimizing performance
against the worst-case distributions within a prescribed ambiguity set.
However, existing DRO-based FL methods often overlook the detrimental impact of
outliers in local datasets, which can disproportionately bias the learned
models. In this work, we study distributionally robust federated learning with
explicit outlier resilience. We introduce a novel ambiguity set based on the
unbalanced Wasserstein distance, which jointly captures geometric
distributional shifts and incorporates a non-geometric Kullback--Leibler
penalization to mitigate the influence of outliers. This formulation naturally
leads to a challenging min--max--max optimization problem. To enable
decentralized training, we reformulate the problem as a tractable Lagrangian
penalty optimization, which admits robustness certificates. Building on this
reformulation, we propose the distributionally outlier-robust federated
learning algorithm and establish its convergence guarantees. Extensive
experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness of our approach.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 核方法虽然理论扎实，但长期以来受限于时间和内存成本的可扩展性问题。在基础模型时代，缺乏可扩展的基于核的表示学习框架限制了其在大规模无标签数据上的应用。

Method: 使用Nyström近似构建统一的核表示学习框架KREPES，支持多种无监督和自监督损失函数。

Result: 在大型图像和表格数据集上的实验证明了KREPES的高效性，并且能够对学习到的表示进行原则性解释。

Conclusion: KREPES为核方法在大规模表示学习中提供了可行的解决方案，相比深度模型具有更好的可解释性优势。

Abstract: Kernel methods provide a theoretically grounded framework for non-linear and
non-parametric learning, with strong analytic foundations and statistical
guarantees. Yet, their scalability has long been limited by prohibitive time
and memory costs. While progress has been made in scaling kernel regression, no
framework exists for scalable kernel-based representation learning, restricting
their use in the era of foundation models where representations are learned
from massive unlabeled data. We introduce KREPES -- a unified, scalable
framework for kernel-based representation learning via Nystr\"om approximation.
KREPES accommodates a wide range of unsupervised and self-supervised losses,
and experiments on large image and tabular datasets demonstrate its efficiency.
Crucially, KREPES enables principled interpretability of the learned
representations, an immediate benefit over deep models, which we substantiate
through dedicated analysis.

TL;DR: 本文提出了FS-KAN，一种用于任意置换对称群的等变和不变KA层的原则性方法，统一并显著扩展了该领域先前的工作。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然等变KAN在最近文献中针对特定数据类型进行了探索，但在一般背景下对具有置换对称性的数据应用的原则性框架仍然缺失。

Method: 通过将参数共享方案推广到Kolmogorov-Arnold设置，推导出这些FS-KAN层的基本构造，并提供理论分析。

Result: 实证评估显示，FS-KAN在多种数据类型和对称群上表现出比标准参数共享层更优越的数据效率，在某些情况下优势显著。

Conclusion: FS-KAN在保持KAN可解释性和适应性的同时，在低数据状态下成为优秀的架构选择。

Abstract: Permutation equivariant neural networks employing parameter-sharing schemes
have emerged as powerful models for leveraging a wide range of data symmetries,
significantly enhancing the generalization and computational efficiency of the
resulting models. Recently, Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) have demonstrated
promise through their improved interpretability and expressivity compared to
traditional architectures based on MLPs. While equivariant KANs have been
explored in recent literature for a few specific data types, a principled
framework for applying them to data with permutation symmetries in a general
context remains absent. This paper introduces Function Sharing KAN (FS-KAN), a
principled approach to constructing equivariant and invariant KA layers for
arbitrary permutation symmetry groups, unifying and significantly extending
previous work in this domain. We derive the basic construction of these FS-KAN
layers by generalizing parameter-sharing schemes to the Kolmogorov-Arnold setup
and provide a theoretical analysis demonstrating that FS-KANs have the same
expressive power as networks that use standard parameter-sharing layers,
allowing us to transfer well-known and important expressivity results from
parameter-sharing networks to FS-KANs. Empirical evaluations on multiple data
types and symmetry groups show that FS-KANs exhibit superior data efficiency
compared to standard parameter-sharing layers, by a wide margin in certain
cases, while preserving the interpretability and adaptability of KANs, making
them an excellent architecture choice in low-data regimes.

Motivation: 解决持续学习中提示方法的权衡问题：任务特定提示方法计算开销大且内存需求随任务数量线性增长，而共享提示方法效率高但存在知识干扰导致性能下降。

Method: 1. 在稀疏混合专家架构中组织共享提示为多个"提示专家"；2. 引入提示注意力分数聚合机制进行动态稀疏激活；3. 提出自适应噪声机制平衡专家利用；4. 设计基于原型的损失函数增强专家专业化。

Result: 在多个持续学习基准测试中，SMoPE始终优于任务特定提示方法，性能与最先进方法相当，同时显著减少参数数量和计算成本。

Conclusion: SMoPE成功平衡了效率和性能的权衡，通过稀疏专家激活机制有效缓解知识干扰，为持续学习中的提示方法提供了更优的解决方案。

Abstract: Prompt-based methods have recently gained prominence in Continual Learning
(CL) due to their strong performance and memory efficiency. A prevalent
strategy in this paradigm assigns a dedicated subset of prompts to each task,
which, while effective, incurs substantial computational overhead and causes
memory requirements to scale linearly with the number of tasks. Conversely,
approaches employing a single shared prompt across tasks offer greater
efficiency but often suffer from degraded performance due to knowledge
interference. To reconcile this trade-off, we propose SMoPE, a novel framework
that integrates the benefits of both task-specific and shared prompt
strategies. Inspired by recent findings on the relationship between Prefix
Tuning and Mixture of Experts (MoE), SMoPE organizes a shared prompt into
multiple "prompt experts" within a sparse MoE architecture. For each input,
only a select subset of relevant experts is activated, effectively mitigating
interference. To facilitate expert selection, we introduce a prompt-attention
score aggregation mechanism that computes a unified proxy score for each
expert, enabling dynamic and sparse activation. Additionally, we propose an
adaptive noise mechanism to encourage balanced expert utilization while
preserving knowledge from prior tasks. To further enhance expert
specialization, we design a prototype-based loss function that leverages prefix
keys as implicit memory representations. Extensive experiments across multiple
CL benchmarks demonstrate that SMoPE consistently outperforms task-specific
prompt methods and achieves performance competitive with state-of-the-art
approaches, all while significantly reducing parameter counts and computational
costs.

TL;DR: GUIDE是一个轻量级的证据学习元模型方法，可以附加到冻结的深度学习模型上，明确学习如何以及何时表达不确定性，无需重新训练或架构修改。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 可靠的分布偏移不确定性量化仍然是深度学习模型部署的主要障碍。现有方法要么继承错误置信度，要么仅重塑预测，而没有教会模型何时应该不确定。

Method: GUIDE通过校准阶段识别显著内部特征，然后使用这些特征构建噪声驱动的课程，教会模型如何以及何时表达不确定性。该方法不需要重新训练、架构修改或手动中间层选择。

Result: GUIDE避免了从基础模型蒸馏过度自信，将分布外检测提高了约77%，对抗攻击检测提高了约80%，同时保持分布内性能。在各种基准测试中始终优于最先进方法。

Conclusion: GUIDE证明了主动引导不确定性的必要性，以缩小预测置信度与可靠性之间的差距。

Abstract: Reliable uncertainty quantification remains a major obstacle to the
deployment of deep learning models under distributional shift. Existing
post-hoc approaches that retrofit pretrained models either inherit misplaced
confidence or merely reshape predictions, without teaching the model when to be
uncertain. We introduce GUIDE, a lightweight evidential learning meta-model
approach that attaches to a frozen deep learning model and explicitly learns
how and when to be uncertain. GUIDE identifies salient internal features via a
calibration stage, and then employs these features to construct a noise-driven
curriculum that teaches the model how and when to express uncertainty. GUIDE
requires no retraining, no architectural modifications, and no manual
intermediate-layer selection to the base deep learning model, thus ensuring
broad applicability and minimal user intervention. The resulting model avoids
distilling overconfidence from the base model, improves out-of-distribution
detection by ~77% and adversarial attack detection by ~80%, while preserving
in-distribution performance. Across diverse benchmarks, GUIDE consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, evidencing the need for actively
guiding uncertainty to close the gap between predictive confidence and
reliability.

TL;DR: 本文提出了LLM DNA的概念，将大语言模型的功能行为表示为低维、双Lipschitz表示，用于追踪模型间的进化关系，并构建了LLM进化树。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决当前数百万LLM模型之间通过微调、蒸馏或适应产生的进化关系缺乏文档记录或模糊不清的问题，现有方法受限于任务特异性、固定模型集或对分词器和架构的严格假设。

Method: 数学定义LLM DNA作为功能行为的低维双Lipschitz表示，证明其满足继承和遗传决定论特性，并建立DNA存在性。基于此理论，推导出通用、可扩展、无需训练的DNA提取流程。

Result: 在305个LLM上的实验表明，DNA与先前有限子集研究一致，在特定任务上表现优异或具竞争力。DNA比较揭示了LLM间先前未记录的关联，构建的进化树反映了从编码器-解码器到仅解码器架构的转变、时间进展以及不同LLM家族的进化速度差异。

Conclusion: LLM DNA为理解和管理LLM进化关系提供了理论基础和实用工具，能够揭示模型间的隐含关联并构建系统发育树，有助于LLM生态系统的透明化和系统化管理。

Abstract: The explosive growth of large language models (LLMs) has created a vast but
opaque landscape: millions of models exist, yet their evolutionary
relationships through fine-tuning, distillation, or adaptation are often
undocumented or unclear, complicating LLM management. Existing methods are
limited by task specificity, fixed model sets, or strict assumptions about
tokenizers or architectures. Inspired by biological DNA, we address these
limitations by mathematically defining LLM DNA as a low-dimensional,
bi-Lipschitz representation of functional behavior. We prove that LLM DNA
satisfies inheritance and genetic determinism properties and establish the
existence of DNA. Building on this theory, we derive a general, scalable,
training-free pipeline for DNA extraction. In experiments across 305 LLMs, DNA
aligns with prior studies on limited subsets and achieves superior or
competitive performance on specific tasks. Beyond these tasks, DNA comparisons
uncover previously undocumented relationships among LLMs. We further construct
the evolutionary tree of LLMs using phylogenetic algorithms, which align with
shifts from encoder-decoder to decoder-only architectures, reflect temporal
progression, and reveal distinct evolutionary speeds across LLM families.

Motivation: 现有研究对TTT为何有效以及何时有效缺乏理解，传统解释主要关注分布外适应或特权数据使用，但随着基础模型规模扩大且大多数测试数据为分布内数据，这些解释受到质疑。

Method: 在线性表示假设下提出理论模型，通过稀疏自编码器在ImageNet上验证关键假设，并在图像和语言任务上进行扩展研究。

Result: 实证验证了语义相关数据点仅由少数共享概念解释，扩展研究确认了专门化最有效的机制。

Conclusion: TTT通过专门化机制在通用化后聚焦测试任务相关概念，是基础模型在全局欠参数化情况下提升性能的有效方法。

Abstract: Recent empirical studies have explored the idea of continuing to train a
model at test-time for a given task, known as test-time training (TTT), and
have found it to yield significant performance improvements. However, there is
limited understanding of why and when TTT is effective. Earlier explanations
mostly focused on the observation that TTT may help when applied to
out-of-distribution adaptation or used with privileged data. However, the
growing scale of foundation models with most test data being in-distribution
questions these explanations. We instead posit that foundation models remain
globally underparameterized, with TTT providing a mechanism for specialization
after generalization, focusing capacity on concepts relevant to the test task.
Specifically, under the linear representation hypothesis, we propose a model in
which TTT achieves a substantially smaller in-distribution test error than
global training. We empirically validate our model's key assumptions by
training a sparse autoencoder on ImageNet, showing that semantically related
data points are explained by only a few shared concepts. Finally, we perform
scaling studies across image and language tasks that confirm the practical
implications of our model, identifying the regimes where specialization is most
effective.

Motivation: 现代深度学习过度关注模型效能，导致大规模模型资源消耗巨大、碳足迹显著。作者希望探索物理归纳偏置如何提供效能与效率之间的有益权衡。

Method: 研究了多种时空预测模型，包括标准物理信息模型和更近期的流匹配模型，探索不同层次的物理归纳偏置嵌入方法。

Result: 实验表明，嵌入物理归纳偏置可以显著提升效率（计算、能耗、碳足迹），同时保持或改进任务效能。流匹配模型被证明是时空预测的通用有效方法。

Conclusion: 物理归纳偏置为提高机器学习模型效率和减少碳足迹提供了原则性方法，模型效率应与模型效能一起成为机器学习开发和部署的核心考虑因素。

Abstract: Development of modern deep learning methods has been driven primarily by the
push for improving model efficacy (accuracy metrics). This sole focus on
efficacy has steered development of large-scale models that require massive
resources, and results in considerable carbon footprint across the model
life-cycle. In this work, we explore how physics inductive biases can offer
useful trade-offs between model efficacy and model efficiency (compute, energy,
and carbon). We study a variety of models for spatio-temporal forecasting, a
task governed by physical laws and well-suited for exploring different levels
of physics inductive bias. We show that embedding physics inductive biases into
the model design can yield substantial efficiency gains while retaining or even
improving efficacy for the tasks under consideration. In addition to using
standard physics-informed spatio-temporal models, we demonstrate the usefulness
of more recent models like flow matching as a general purpose method for
spatio-temporal forecasting. Our experiments show that incorporating physics
inductive biases offer a principled way to improve the efficiency and reduce
the carbon footprint of machine learning models. We argue that model
efficiency, along with model efficacy, should become a core consideration
driving machine learning model development and deployment.

Motivation: 现有方法存在灾难性遗忘问题，且依赖可能引入语义扭曲的数据增强策略，需要更有效的解决方案。

Result: 在多个FCED基准测试中始终达到最先进的性能。

Conclusion: LEAF框架有效解决了少样本持续事件检测中的灾难性遗忘和泛化问题。

Abstract: Few-shot Continual Event Detection (FCED) poses the dual challenges of
learning from limited data and mitigating catastrophic forgetting across
sequential tasks. Existing approaches often suffer from severe forgetting due
to the full fine-tuning of a shared base model, which leads to knowledge
interference between tasks. Moreover, they frequently rely on data augmentation
strategies that can introduce unnatural or semantically distorted inputs. To
address these limitations, we propose LEAF, a novel and robust expert-based
framework for FCED. LEAF integrates a specialized mixture of experts
architecture into the base model, where each expert is parameterized with
low-rank adaptation (LoRA) matrices. A semantic-aware expert selection
mechanism dynamically routes instances to the most relevant experts, enabling
expert specialization and reducing knowledge interference. To improve
generalization in limited-data settings, LEAF incorporates a contrastive
learning objective guided by label descriptions, which capture high-level
semantic information about event types. Furthermore, to prevent overfitting on
the memory buffer, our framework employs a knowledge distillation strategy that
transfers knowledge from previous models to the current one. Extensive
experiments on multiple FCED benchmarks demonstrate that LEAF consistently
achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: Video-to-audio (V2A) generation aims to synthesize realistic and semantically
aligned audio from silent videos, with potential applications in video editing,
Foley sound design, and assistive multimedia. Although the excellent results,
existing approaches either require costly joint training on large-scale paired
datasets or rely on pairwise similarities that may fail to capture global
multimodal coherence. In this work, we propose a novel training-free multimodal
guidance mechanism for V2A diffusion that leverages the volume spanned by the
modality embeddings to enforce unified alignment across video, audio, and text.
The proposed multimodal diffusion guidance (MDG) provides a lightweight,
plug-and-play control signal that can be applied on top of any pretrained audio
diffusion model without retraining. Experiments on VGGSound and AudioCaps
demonstrate that our MDG consistently improves perceptual quality and
multimodal alignment compared to baselines, proving the effectiveness of a
joint multimodal guidance for V2A.

Motivation: 现有研究表明混合架构（滑动窗口注意力+线性RNN层）优于单独使用这两种架构，但窗口长度的影响以及注意力机制与线性RNN层之间的相互作用尚未得到充分研究。

Method: 提出SWAX混合架构，结合滑动窗口注意力和xLSTM线性RNN层。采用随机改变滑动窗口大小的训练策略，强制模型同时利用更长上下文窗口和xLSTM记忆。

Result: 反直觉发现：更大的滑动窗口不会改善长上下文性能。短窗口注意力通过减少对注意力机制的依赖，能更好地训练xLSTM的长期记忆。随机窗口训练策略显著提升了短上下文和长上下文任务的性能。

Conclusion: SWAX通过随机窗口训练策略，在短上下文和长上下文任务上都优于常规窗口注意力，证明了混合架构和动态训练策略的有效性。

Abstract: Recent works show that hybrid architectures combining sliding window softmax
attention layers with linear recurrent neural network (RNN) layers outperform
both of these architectures taken separately. However, the impact of the window
length and the interplay between softmax attention and linear RNN layers remain
under-studied. In this work, we introduce SWAX, a hybrid architecture
consisting of sliding-window attention and xLSTM linear RNN layers.
  A counter-intuitive finding with SWAX is that larger sliding windows do not
improve the long-context performance. In fact, short window attention
encourages the model to better train the long-term memory of the xLSTM, by
relying less on the softmax attention mechanism for long context-retrieval.
  The issue with small sliding windows is that they are detrimental for
short-context tasks, which could be solved with information from moderately
larger sliding windows otherwise. Therefore, we train SWAX by stochastically
changing the sliding window size, forcing the model to leverage both a longer
context window and the xLSTM memory. SWAX trained with stochastic window sizes
significantly outperforms regular window attention both on short and
long-context problems.

Conclusion: 深度强化学习在真实实验环境中具有强大的适应性，能够克服仪器限制如执行延迟，为主动流动控制提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: This study showcases an experimental deployment of deep reinforcement
learning (DRL) for active flow control (AFC) of vortex-induced vibrations (VIV)
in a circular cylinder at a high Reynolds number (Re = 3000) using rotary
actuation. Departing from prior work that relied on low-Reynolds-number
numerical simulations, this research demonstrates real-time control in a
challenging experimental setting, successfully addressing practical constraints
such as actuator delay. When the learning algorithm is provided with state
feedback alone (displacement and velocity of the oscillating cylinder), the DRL
agent learns a low-frequency rotary control strategy that achieves up to 80%
vibration suppression which leverages the traditional lock-on phenomenon. While
this level of suppression is significant, it remains below the performance
achieved using high-frequency rotary actuation. The reduction in performance is
attributed to actuation delays and can be mitigated by augmenting the learning
algorithm with past control actions. This enables the agent to learn a
high-frequency rotary control strategy that effectively modifies vortex
shedding and achieves over 95% vibration attenuation. These results demonstrate
the adaptability of DRL for AFC in real-world experiments and its ability to
overcome instrumental limitations such as actuation lag.

Result: 发现OpenVLA在状态转移预测上具有统计显著性的预测能力，超过了基线水平，表明模型编码了内部世界模型。早期检查点的分析显示世界模型能力随训练进展而涌现。

Conclusion: OpenVLA确实隐式学习了世界模型，且提出了利用稀疏自编码器分析其世界模型的管道。

Abstract: Vision Language Action models (VLAs) trained with policy-based reinforcement
learning (RL) encode complex behaviors without explicitly modeling
environmental dynamics. However, it remains unclear whether VLAs implicitly
learn world models, a hallmark of model-based RL. We propose an experimental
methodology using embedding arithmetic on state representations to probe
whether OpenVLA, the current state of the art in VLAs, contains latent
knowledge of state transitions. Specifically, we measure the difference between
embeddings of sequential environment states and test whether this transition
vector is recoverable from intermediate model activations. Using linear and non
linear probes trained on activations across layers, we find statistically
significant predictive ability on state transitions exceeding baselines
(embeddings), indicating that OpenVLA encodes an internal world model (as
opposed to the probes learning the state transitions). We investigate the
predictive ability of an earlier checkpoint of OpenVLA, and uncover hints that
the world model emerges as training progresses. Finally, we outline a pipeline
leveraging Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) to analyze OpenVLA's world model.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于学习的框架，通过动态预测器和优化代理网络相结合，高效解决PDE约束优化问题，计算速度提升四个数量级。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Abstract: Partial differential equation (PDE)-constrained optimization arises in many
scientific and engineering domains, such as energy systems, fluid dynamics and
material design. In these problems, the decision variables (e.g., control
inputs or design parameters) are tightly coupled with the PDE state variables,
and the feasible set is implicitly defined by the governing PDE constraints.
This coupling makes the problems computationally demanding, as it requires
handling high dimensional discretization and dynamic constraints. To address
these challenges, this paper introduces a learning-based framework that
integrates a dynamic predictor with an optimization surrogate. The dynamic
predictor, a novel time-discrete Neural Operator (Lu et al.), efficiently
approximate system trajectories governed by PDE dynamics, while the
optimization surrogate leverages proxy optimizer techniques (Kotary et al.) to
approximate the associated optimal decisions. This dual-network design enables
real-time approximation of optimal strategies while explicitly capturing the
coupling between decisions and PDE dynamics. We validate the proposed approach
on benchmark PDE-constrained optimization tasks inlacing Burgers' equation,
heat equation and voltage regulation, and demonstrate that it achieves solution
quality comparable to classical control-based algorithms, such as the Direct
Method and Model Predictive Control (MPC), while providing up to four orders of
magnitude improvement in computational speed.

Motivation: 现有方法使用固定的手动调整尺度来平衡先验与似然项，这种静态设计在不同时间步和任务中表现不佳，限制了性能和泛化能力

Method: SAIP是一个即插即用模块，在每个时间步自适应地优化尺度参数，无需重新训练或修改扩散主干网络，可无缝集成到现有采样器中

Result: SAIP在多种图像恢复任务中持续提升重建质量，包括具有挑战性的场景

Conclusion: SAIP通过自适应尺度调整有效解决了现有方法的局限性，为扩散模型在逆问题中的应用提供了更优的解决方案

Abstract: Solving inverse problems with diffusion models has shown promise in tasks
such as image restoration. A common approach is to formulate the problem in a
Bayesian framework and sample from the posterior by combining the prior score
with the likelihood score. Since the likelihood term is often intractable,
estimators like DPS, DMPS, and $\pi$GDM are widely adopted. However, these
methods rely on a fixed, manually tuned scale to balance prior and likelihood
contributions. Such a static design is suboptimal, as the ideal balance varies
across timesteps and tasks, limiting performance and generalization. To address
this issue, we propose SAIP, a plug-and-play module that adaptively refines the
scale at each timestep without retraining or altering the diffusion backbone.
SAIP integrates seamlessly into existing samplers and consistently improves
reconstruction quality across diverse image restoration tasks, including
challenging scenarios.

TL;DR: CURA是一种受模拟音频信号处理电路启发的紧凑型AI架构，在资源受限环境中实现跨域机器学习任务，显著减少参数需求并提升泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有设备端AI架构的两个关键限制：参数需求随任务复杂度线性增长导致缺乏紧凑性，以及特定领域模型无法适应其他应用领域的泛化能力差问题。

Method: 提出CURA架构，灵感来源于模拟音频信号处理电路，提供跨回归、分类、自然语言处理和计算机视觉任务的紧凑轻量解决方案。

Result: 在紧凑性方面，使用比基线模型少2500倍的参数实现同等精度；在泛化性方面，在四个NLP基准和一个计算机视觉数据集上表现一致，F1分数达90%；在复杂模式识别方面，平均绝对误差降低1.6倍，均方误差降低2.1倍。

Conclusion: CURA架构为资源受限环境提供了紧凑、泛化能力强且能识别复杂模式的AI解决方案，显著优于现有方法。

Abstract: Existing on-device AI architectures for resource-constrained environments
face two critical limitations: they lack compactness, with parameter
requirements scaling proportionally to task complexity, and they exhibit poor
generalizability, performing effectively only on specific application domains
(e.g., models designed for regression tasks cannot adapt to natural language
processing (NLP) applications). In this paper, we propose CURA, an architecture
inspired by analog audio signal processing circuits that provides a compact and
lightweight solution for diverse machine learning tasks across multiple
domains. Our architecture offers three key advantages over existing approaches:
(1) Compactness: it requires significantly fewer parameters regardless of task
complexity; (2) Generalizability: it adapts seamlessly across regression,
classification, complex NLP, and computer vision tasks; and (3) Complex pattern
recognition: it can capture intricate data patterns while maintaining extremely
low model complexity. We evaluated CURA across diverse datasets and domains.
For compactness, it achieved equivalent accuracy using up to 2,500 times fewer
parameters compared to baseline models. For generalizability, it demonstrated
consistent performance across four NLP benchmarks and one computer vision
dataset, nearly matching specialized existing models (achieving F1-scores up to
90%). Lastly, it delivers superior forecasting accuracy for complex patterns,
achieving 1.6 times lower mean absolute error and 2.1 times lower mean squared
error than competing models.

TL;DR: 本文比较了决策曲线分析(DCA)和成本曲线在模型评估中的关系，发现决策曲线与Brier曲线密切相关，两者在相同阈值下会选择相同的最优模型，但Brier曲线适用范围更广且面积等于Brier分数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的分类模型评估方法未能充分考虑模型使用场景和决策阈值的影响，需要评估方法能够反映模型在不同阈值下的预期效用和损失。

Method: 通过理论分析和比较决策曲线分析(DCA)与成本曲线(特别是Brier曲线)的数学关系，研究两者在模型评估中的异同点。

Result: 决策曲线与Brier曲线在假设模型得分已校准且基于正负例分类相对价值设置阈值时密切相关，两者x轴等价，在任何给定阈值下都会选择相同的最优模型。

Conclusion: Brier曲线具有更广泛的适用性，其面积等于Brier分数，建议使用上包络决策曲线来显示仅通过重新校准可能实现的净收益增益。

Abstract: Classification models typically predict a score and use a decision threshold
to produce a classification. Appropriate model evaluation should carefully
consider the context in which a model will be used, including the relative
value of correct classifications of positive versus negative examples, which
affects the threshold that should be used. Decision curve analysis (DCA) and
cost curves are model evaluation approaches that assess the expected utility
and expected loss of prediction models, respectively, across decision
thresholds. We compared DCA and cost curves to determine how they are related,
and their strengths and limitations. We demonstrate that decision curves are
closely related to a specific type of cost curve called a Brier curve. Both
curves are derived assuming model scores are calibrated and setting the
classification threshold using the relative value of correct positive and
negative classifications, and the x-axis of both curves are equivalent. Net
benefit (used for DCA) and Brier loss (used for Brier curves) will always
choose the same model as optimal at any given threshold. Across thresholds,
differences in Brier loss are comparable whereas differences in net benefit
cannot be compared. Brier curves are more generally applicable (when a wider
range of thresholds are plausible), and the area under the Brier curve is the
Brier score. We demonstrate that reference lines common in each space can be
included in either and suggest the upper envelope decision curve as a useful
comparison for DCA showing the possible gain in net benefit that could be
achieved through recalibration alone.

TL;DR: OrthAlign通过正交子空间分解解决多目标偏好对齐中的梯度冲突，确保不同偏好的优化在数学上互不干扰的方向上进行，实现稳定收敛。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型对齐面临多目标偏好的关键困境：改进一个维度往往以牺牲其他维度为代价，在帮助性和无害性等竞争目标间存在不可避免的权衡。现有方法主要关注约束优化算法和数据选择策略，但忽视了在参数层面直接解决冲突的根本问题。

Method: OrthAlign利用正交子空间分解，将参数更新空间分解为正交子空间，确保不同偏好的优化在数学上互不干扰的方向上进行。该方法提供理论保证，当参数增量满足正交子空间约束和谱范数边界时，更新呈现线性Lipschitz增长而非指数不稳定性。

Result: 实验表明：I. OrthAlign在多目标对齐后，在帮助性、无害性和真实性维度上实现单偏好最大改进34.61%至50.89%；II. 平均总体奖励改进达到13.96%。

Conclusion: OrthAlign通过正交子空间分解从根本上解决了多目标偏好对齐中的梯度级冲突，实现了在所有偏好维度上的稳定收敛和显著性能提升。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) alignment faces a critical dilemma when addressing
multiple human preferences: improvements in one dimension frequently come at
the expense of others, creating unavoidable trade-offs between competing
objectives like helpfulness and harmlessness. While prior work mainly focuses
on constraint-based optimization algorithms and data selection strategies to
mitigate conflicts, these approaches overlook the fundamental issue of
resolving conflicts directly at the parameter level. In this paper, we present
OrthAlign, an innovative approach that pioneers a new paradigm by leveraging
orthogonal subspace decomposition to fundamentally resolve gradient-level
conflicts in multi-objective preference alignment. OrthAlign strategically
decomposes parameter update spaces into orthogonal subspaces, ensuring that
optimization toward different preferences occurs in mathematically
non-interfering directions. Building upon this, we provide theoretical
guarantees demonstrating that when parameter increments satisfy both orthogonal
subspace constraints and spectral norm bounds, the resulting updates exhibit
linear Lipschitz growth rather than exponential instability, ensuring stable
convergence across all preference dimensions. Extensive experiments show that:
I. OrthAlign achieves maximum single-preference improvements ranging from
34.61% to 50.89% after multiple-objective alignment across helpful, harmless,
and truthful dimensions. II. With an average overall reward improvement of
13.96%.

Method: 基于两个核心组件：几何约束辛自编码器学习低维结构保持辛子流形，以及几何哈密顿神经网络在子流形上建模动力学。

Result: 实验证明RO-HNN能提供物理一致、稳定且可泛化的复杂高维动力学预测。

Conclusion: RO-HNN有效扩展了哈密顿神经网络在高维物理系统中的应用范围。

Abstract: By embedding physical intuition, network architectures enforce fundamental
properties, such as energy conservation laws, leading to plausible predictions.
Yet, scaling these models to intrinsically high-dimensional systems remains a
significant challenge. This paper introduces Geometric Reduced-order
Hamiltonian Neural Network (RO-HNN), a novel physics-inspired neural network
that combines the conservation laws of Hamiltonian mechanics with the
scalability of model order reduction. RO-HNN is built on two core components: a
novel geometrically-constrained symplectic autoencoder that learns a
low-dimensional, structure-preserving symplectic submanifold, and a geometric
Hamiltonian neural network that models the dynamics on the submanifold. Our
experiments demonstrate that RO-HNN provides physically-consistent, stable, and
generalizable predictions of complex high-dimensional dynamics, thereby
effectively extending the scope of Hamiltonian neural networks to
high-dimensional physical systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在组合推理任务中经常失败，特别是存在"两跳推理诅咒"现象，即模型无法进行超出训练分布的两步推理。

Method: 引入Identity Bridge机制，在零跳身份任务上监督模型；使用简化的Emb-MLP模型进行理论分析；通过小初始化或权重衰减增强正则化效果；扩展到大规模模型研究。

Result: 身份监督使模型能够成功执行超出分布的两跳推理任务；理论分析表明身份监督通过隐式核范数正则化重塑模型的潜在几何结构；小初始化增强了潜在空间对齐效果。

Conclusion: Identity Bridge机制有效解决了LLM的组合推理问题，身份监督通过隐式正则化促进跨任务结构共享，为增强模型隐含推理能力提供了重要启示。

Abstract: Despite remarkable advances, large language models often fail at
compositional reasoning tasks, a phenomenon exemplified by the ``curse of
two-hop reasoning''. This paper introduces the Identity Bridge, a simple yet
powerful mechanism that resolves this compositionality gap by supervising the
model on a zero-hop identity task. We demonstrate empirically that this
addition enables models to successfully perform out-of-distribution two-hop
reasoning, a task they otherwise completely fail. To explain this phenomenon,
we provide a theoretical analysis using a simplified Emb-MLP model, proving
that identity supervision reshapes the model's latent geometry. We show this
alignment is induced by an implicit nuclear-norm regularization during
optimization, which favors low-rank solutions that share structure across
tasks. For complex tasks, we use small initialization or weight decay to
enhance the regularization effect, which enhances the latent space alignment
effect and slows down the generalization decay. Finally, we extend our
investigation to large-scale models, observing that they still achieve two-hop
reasoning through the latent memory, which provides crucial inspiration for
enhancing their implicit reasoning abilities.

TL;DR: HyperHELM是一个在双曲空间中为mRNA序列实现掩码语言模型预训练的框架，通过混合设计将双曲层置于欧几里得骨干网络之上，使学习表示与mRNA和氨基酸之间的生物层次结构对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语言模型越来越多地应用于蛋白质和mRNA等生物序列，但其默认的欧几里得几何可能与生物数据固有的层次结构不匹配。双曲几何为容纳层次数据提供了更好的替代方案，但尚未应用于mRNA序列的语言建模。

Method: 采用混合设计，在欧几里得骨干网络之上添加双曲层，在双曲空间中实现掩码语言模型预训练，使学习表示与mRNA和氨基酸之间的生物层次结构对齐。

Result: 在多个多物种数据集上，在10个属性预测任务中有9个优于欧几里得基线，平均提升10%；在长序列和低GC含量序列的分布外泛化方面表现出色；在抗体区域注释任务中，比层次感知的欧几里得模型准确率提高3%。

Conclusion: 双曲几何是mRNA序列层次语言建模的有效归纳偏置，能够更好地捕捉生物数据的层次结构特性。

Abstract: Language models are increasingly applied to biological sequences like
proteins and mRNA, yet their default Euclidean geometry may mismatch the
hierarchical structures inherent to biological data. While hyperbolic geometry
provides a better alternative for accommodating hierarchical data, it has yet
to find a way into language modeling for mRNA sequences. In this work, we
introduce HyperHELM, a framework that implements masked language model
pre-training in hyperbolic space for mRNA sequences. Using a hybrid design with
hyperbolic layers atop Euclidean backbone, HyperHELM aligns learned
representations with the biological hierarchy defined by the relationship
between mRNA and amino acids. Across multiple multi-species datasets, it
outperforms Euclidean baselines on 9 out of 10 tasks involving property
prediction, with 10% improvement on average, and excels in out-of-distribution
generalization to long and low-GC content sequences; for antibody region
annotation, it surpasses hierarchy-aware Euclidean models by 3% in annotation
accuracy. Our results highlight hyperbolic geometry as an effective inductive
bias for hierarchical language modeling of mRNA sequences.

Conclusion: T-POP为LLM实时个性化提供了有效解决方案，通过在线偏好反馈克服了冷启动问题，展示了在有限交互下实现高质量个性化的能力。

Abstract: Personalizing large language models (LLMs) to individual user preferences is
a critical step beyond generating generically helpful responses. However,
current personalization methods are ill-suited for new users, as they typically
require either slow, resource-intensive fine-tuning or a substantial amount of
pre-existing user data, creating a significant cold-start problem. To address
this challenge, we introduce a new paradigm for real-time personalization by
learning from online pairwise preference feedback collected during text
generation. We propose T-POP (Test-Time Personalization with Online Preference
Feedback}), a novel algorithm that synergistically combines test-time alignment
with dueling bandits. Without updating the LLM parameters, T-POP steers the
decoding process of a frozen LLM by learning a reward function online that
captures user preferences. By leveraging dueling bandits, T-POP intelligently
queries the user to efficiently balance between exploring their preferences and
exploiting the learned knowledge to generate personalized text. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that T-POP achieves rapid and data-efficient
personalization, significantly outperforming existing baselines and showing
consistent improvement with more user interactions.

Conclusion: 联邦多臂老虎机框架有效解决了LLM提示优化的关键挑战，实现了样本高效、隐私保护的协作优化。

Abstract: The performance of large language models (LLMs) is highly sensitive to the
input prompt, making prompt optimization a critical task. However, real-world
application is hindered by three major challenges: (1) the black-box nature of
powerful proprietary LLMs, (2) the need for high sample efficiency due to query
costs, and (3) the desire for privacy-preserving collaboration among multiple
users. To address these challenges simultaneously, we introduce a novel
framework for sample-efficient federated prompt optimization based on
multi-armed bandits (MABs). The MAB framework is uniquely suited for this
problem as it is (1) inherently a black-box optimization method, (2)
practically sample-efficient, and (3) enables collaborative learning with
theoretically guaranteed benefit from more participating agents. We first
propose the Federated Prompt Optimization via Bandits (FedPOB) algorithm, a
federated variant of the Linear UCB algorithm, where agents collaborate by
sharing model parameters instead of raw data. We then extend our approach to
the practical setting of comparative user feedback by introducing FedPOB with
Preference Feedback (FedPOB-Pref), an efficient algorithm based on federated
dueling bandits. Extensive experiments demonstrate that both FedPOB and
FedPOB-Pref significantly outperform existing baselines and that their
performance consistently improves as more agents participate in the
collaboration, validating the effectiveness of our federated approach.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) reward models exhibit
systematic failures on longtail distributions, leading to reward hacking and
misalignment. We propose a mechanistic interpretability framework that
identifies specialized neural circuits responsible for rare-event processing in
reward models. Drawing from recent advances showing distributed specialization
for rare tokens in language models\citep{liu2025no, liu2025emergent}, we
hypothesize that reward models also develop functionally distinct circuits for
longtail scenarios. Our theoretical framework establishes formal connections
between circuit specialization, reward generalization bounds, and longtail
performance. We introduce \textbf{Circuit-Aware Reward Training (CART)}, which
uses circuit analysis to guide data augmentation, regularization, and ensemble
strategies. This approach provides both theoretical insights into reward model
failures and practical interventions for improving longtail robustness.

Conclusion: 该方法为离散VAE提供了一种有效的训练框架，在高维数据重建任务中取得了显著改进

Abstract: Discrete latent bottlenecks in variational autoencoders (VAEs) offer high bit
efficiency and can be modeled with autoregressive discrete distributions,
enabling parameter-efficient multimodal search with transformers. However,
discrete random variables do not allow for exact differentiable
parameterization; therefore, discrete VAEs typically rely on approximations,
such as Gumbel-Softmax reparameterization or straight-through gradient
estimates, or employ high-variance gradient-free methods such as REINFORCE that
have had limited success on high-dimensional tasks such as image
reconstruction. Inspired by popular techniques in policy search, we propose a
training framework for discrete VAEs that leverages the natural gradient of a
non-parametric encoder to update the parametric encoder without requiring
reparameterization. Our method, combined with automatic step size adaptation
and a transformer-based encoder, scales to challenging datasets such as
ImageNet and outperforms both approximate reparameterization methods and
quantization-based discrete autoencoders in reconstructing high-dimensional
data from compact latent spaces, achieving a 20% improvement on FID Score for
ImageNet 256.

Abstract: Estimating queue lengths at signalized intersections remains a challenge in
traffic management, especially under partially observed conditions where
vehicle flows are not fully captured. This paper introduces Q-Net, a
data-efficient and interpretable framework for queue length estimation that
performs robustly even when traffic conservation assumptions are violated.
Q-Net integrates two widely available and privacy-friendly data sources: (i)
vehicle counts from loop detectors near stop lines, and (ii) aggregated
floating car data (aFCD), which divides each road section into segments and
provides segment-wise average speed measurements. These data sources often
differ in spatial and temporal resolution, creating fusion challenges. Q-Net
addresses this by employing a tailored state-space model and an AI-augmented
Kalman filter, KalmanNet, which learns the Kalman gain from data without
requiring prior knowledge of noise covariances or full system dynamics. We
build on the vanilla KalmanNet pipeline to decouple measurement dimensionality
from section length, enabling spatial transferability across road segments.
Unlike black-box models, Q-Net maintains physical interpretability, with
internal variables linked to real-world traffic dynamics. Evaluations on main
roads in Rotterdam, the Netherlands, demonstrate that Q-Net outperforms
baseline methods by over 60\% in Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), accurately
tracking queue formation and dissipation while correcting aFCD-induced delays.
Q-Net also demonstrates strong spatial and temporal transferability, enabling
deployment without costly sensing infrastructure like cameras or radar.
Additionally, we propose a real-time variant of Q-Net, highlighting its
potential for integration into dynamic, queue-based traffic control systems.

Motivation: 深度学习中的潜在分类变量广泛存在，但其离散性质给梯度下降学习带来挑战。现有改进方法主要集中在梯度估计技术上，本文从函数设计角度提供补充方案。

Method: 1) 从信息几何角度分析softmax函数的局限性；2) 提出catnat函数，由一系列层次化二分组成，能产生对角Fisher信息矩阵。

Result: 在图结构学习、变分自编码器和强化学习等实验中，catnat函数提高了学习效率，并获得了更高的测试性能。

Conclusion: catnat函数易于实现，与现有代码库兼容，且与标准训练稳定技术兼容，是softmax函数的更好替代方案。

Abstract: Latent categorical variables are frequently found in deep learning
architectures. They can model actions in discrete reinforcement-learning
environments, represent categories in latent-variable models, or express
relations in graph neural networks. Despite their widespread use, their
discrete nature poses significant challenges to gradient-descent learning
algorithms. While a substantial body of work has offered improved gradient
estimation techniques, we take a complementary approach. Specifically, we: 1)
revisit the ubiquitous $\textit{softmax}$ function and demonstrate its
limitations from an information-geometric perspective; 2) replace the
$\textit{softmax}$ with the $\textit{catnat}$ function, a function composed of
a sequence of hierarchical binary splits; we prove that this choice offers
significant advantages to gradient descent due to the resulting diagonal Fisher
Information Matrix. A rich set of experiments - including graph structure
learning, variational autoencoders, and reinforcement learning - empirically
show that the proposed function improves the learning efficiency and yields
models characterized by consistently higher test performance. $\textit{Catnat}$
is simple to implement and seamlessly integrates into existing codebases.
Moreover, it remains compatible with standard training stabilization techniques
and, as such, offers a better alternative to the $\textit{softmax}$ function.

Abstract: Multimodal learning plays a pivotal role in advancing artificial intelligence
systems by incorporating information from multiple modalities to build a more
comprehensive representation. Despite its importance, current state-of-the-art
models still suffer from severe limitations that prevent the successful
development of a fully multimodal model. Such methods may not provide
indicators that all the involved modalities are effectively aligned. As a
result, some modalities may not be aligned, undermining the effectiveness of
the model in downstream tasks where multiple modalities should provide
additional information that the model fails to exploit. In this paper, we
present TRIANGLE: TRI-modAl Neural Geometric LEarning, the novel proposed
similarity measure that is directly computed in the higher-dimensional space
spanned by the modality embeddings. TRIANGLE improves the joint alignment of
three modalities via a triangle-area similarity, avoiding additional fusion
layers or pairwise similarities. When incorporated in contrastive losses
replacing cosine similarity, TRIANGLE significantly boosts the performance of
multimodal modeling, while yielding interpretable alignment rationales.
Extensive evaluation in three-modal tasks such as video-text and audio-text
retrieval or audio-video classification, demonstrates that TRIANGLE achieves
state-of-the-art results across different datasets improving the performance of
cosine-based methods up to 9 points of Recall@1.

Method: 提出RPEX方法，将逆概率加权（IPW）整合到在线探索策略中，以减轻数据污染引起的策略重尾行为。

Abstract: Pretraining a policy on offline data followed by fine-tuning through online
interactions, known as Offline-to-Online Reinforcement Learning (O2O RL), has
emerged as a promising paradigm for real-world RL deployment. However, both
offline datasets and online interactions in practical environments are often
noisy or even maliciously corrupted, severely degrading the performance of O2O
RL. Existing works primarily focus on mitigating the conservatism of offline
policies via online exploration, while the robustness of O2O RL under data
corruption, including states, actions, rewards, and dynamics, is still
unexplored. In this work, we observe that data corruption induces heavy-tailed
behavior in the policy, thereby substantially degrading the efficiency of
online exploration. To address this issue, we incorporate Inverse Probability
Weighted (IPW) into the online exploration policy to alleviate
heavy-tailedness, and propose a novel, simple yet effective method termed
$\textbf{RPEX}$: $\textbf{R}$obust $\textbf{P}$olicy $\textbf{EX}$pansion.
Extensive experimental results on D4RL datasets demonstrate that RPEX achieves
SOTA O2O performance across a wide range of data corruption scenarios. Code is

Motivation: 当前神经网络方法需要为每个目标系统训练专门的模型，缺乏通用性。本文追求一种完全不同的方法，利用摊销推理和上下文学习来构建通用的点过程推理模型。

Method: 使用摊销推理和上下文学习方法，在大规模合成的Hawkes过程数据集上预训练深度神经网络，使其能够从事件序列上下文推断条件强度函数。

Result: 实验表明，这种摊销方法在常见基准数据集上的下一事件预测任务中，能够达到与专门模型相当的性能。

Conclusion: FIM-PP模型展示了通过预训练构建通用点过程推理模型的可行性，能够在无需额外训练或快速微调的情况下处理现实世界数据。

Abstract: Modeling event sequences of multiple event types with marked temporal point
processes (MTPPs) provides a principled way to uncover governing dynamical
rules and predict future events. Current neural network approaches to MTPP
inference rely on training separate, specialized models for each target system.
We pursue a radically different approach: drawing on amortized inference and
in-context learning, we pretrain a deep neural network to infer, in-context,
the conditional intensity functions of event histories from a context defined
by sets of event sequences. Pretraining is performed on a large synthetic
dataset of MTPPs sampled from a broad distribution of Hawkes processes. Once
pretrained, our Foundation Inference Model for Point Processes (FIM-PP) can
estimate MTPPs from real-world data without any additional training, or be
rapidly finetuned to target systems. Experiments show that this amortized
approach matches the performance of specialized models on next-event prediction
across common benchmark datasets.
  Our pretrained model, repository and tutorials will soon be available online

Motivation: 现有幻觉检测方法依赖启发式或简单模型处理孤立计算轨迹，缺乏统一框架来整合注意力图和激活值等多种信号。

Method: 将计算轨迹表示为属性图，其中token是节点，边遵循注意力流，节点和边携带注意力分数和激活值特征，然后应用图神经网络进行幻觉检测。

Result: CHARM在理论上包含先前的注意力启发式方法，实验上在多个基准测试中一致优于其他领先方法，并显示出良好的跨数据集零样本迁移性能。

Conclusion: 图结构在幻觉检测中起重要作用，结合计算轨迹具有显著优势，CHARM方法展现出有前景的零样本跨数据集迁移能力。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often generate incorrect or unsupported content,
known as hallucinations. Existing detection methods rely on heuristics or
simple models over isolated computational traces such as activations, or
attention maps. We unify these signals by representing them as attributed
graphs, where tokens are nodes, edges follow attentional flows, and both carry
features from attention scores and activations. Our approach, CHARM, casts
hallucination detection as a graph learning task and tackles it by applying
GNNs over the above attributed graphs. We show that CHARM provably subsumes
prior attention-based heuristics and, experimentally, it consistently
outperforms other leading approaches across diverse benchmarks. Our results
shed light on the relevant role played by the graph structure and on the
benefits of combining computational traces, whilst showing CHARM exhibits
promising zero-shot performance on cross-dataset transfer.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的生成模型MSM Emulators，通过马尔可夫状态模型学习离散状态间的转移，相比传统分子动力学模拟实现了两个数量级的加速，在蛋白质结构预测方面显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 分子动力学模拟计算成本高昂，现有生成模型学习固定滞后转移密度，训练信号被频繁但无信息的转移主导。需要更高效的蛋白质轨迹生成方法。

Method: 引入MSM Emulators类生成模型，基于马尔可夫状态模型学习离散状态间的转移采样。具体实现为Markov Space Flow Matching (MarS-FM)方法。

Result: MarS-FM相比隐式或显式溶剂分子动力学模拟实现了超过两个数量级的加速，在RMSD、回转半径、二级结构含量等结构指标上均优于现有方法，且在500个残基以内的蛋白质域上表现出良好的泛化能力。

Conclusion: MSM Emulators特别是MarS-FM方法为蛋白质动力学研究提供了高效准确的替代方案，在保持统计特性的同时大幅降低了计算成本。

Abstract: Molecular Dynamics (MD) is a powerful computational microscope for probing
protein functions. However, the need for fine-grained integration and the long
timescales of biomolecular events make MD computationally expensive. To address
this, several generative models have been proposed to generate surrogate
trajectories at lower cost. Yet, these models typically learn a fixed-lag
transition density, causing the training signal to be dominated by frequent but
uninformative transitions. We introduce a new class of generative models, MSM
Emulators, which instead learn to sample transitions across discrete states
defined by an underlying Markov State Model (MSM). We instantiate this class
with Markov Space Flow Matching (MarS-FM), whose sampling offers more than two
orders of magnitude speedup compared to implicit- or explicit-solvent MD
simulations. We benchmark Mars-FM ability to reproduce MD statistics through
structural observables such as RMSD, radius of gyration, and secondary
structure content. Our evaluation spans protein domains (up to 500 residues)
with significant chemical and structural diversity, including unfolding events,
and enforces strict sequence dissimilarity between training and test sets to
assess generalization. Across all metrics, MarS-FM outperforms existing
methods, often by a substantial margin.

flexible setup allows targeted testing of generalisation factors and includes
variants like partial observability, key-and-door tasks, and ice-floor hazards.

TL;DR: 研究德国未来Dunkelflaute事件（风能和太阳能发电低谷期）的影响，使用深度学习降尺度CMIP6气候模拟，发现在SSP2-4.5和SSP5-8.5排放情景下，这类事件的频率和持续时间预计将保持稳定。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 欧洲电网向可再生能源转型，但风能和太阳能的天气依赖性对电网稳定性构成挑战，特别是Dunkelflaute事件可能导致电力供应短缺。

Method: 采用生成式深度学习框架降尺度CMIP6集合的气候模拟，并与ERA5历史数据进行比较，评估德国未来Dunkelflaute事件的发生情况。

Result: 在乐观的低排放（SSP2-4.5）和高排放（SSP5-8.5）情景下，德国Dunkelflaute事件的频率和持续时间在集合平均值中预计与历史时期基本保持不变。

Conclusion: 在所考虑的气候情景下，与Dunkelflaute事件相关的风险预计在整个世纪内保持稳定。

Abstract: The European electricity power grid is transitioning towards renewable energy
sources, characterized by an increasing share of off- and onshore wind and
solar power. However, the weather dependency of these energy sources poses a
challenge to grid stability, with so-called Dunkelflaute events -- periods of
low wind and solar power generation -- being of particular concern due to their
potential to cause electricity supply shortages. In this study, we investigate
the impact of these events on the German electricity production in the years
and decades to come. For this purpose, we adapt a recently developed generative
deep learning framework to downscale climate simulations from the CMIP6
ensemble. We first compare their statistics to the historical record taken from
ERA5 data. Next, we use these downscaled simulations to assess plausible future
occurrences of Dunkelflaute events in Germany under the optimistic low
(SSP2-4.5) and high (SSP5-8.5) emission scenarios. Our analysis indicates that
both the frequency and duration of Dunkelflaute events in Germany in the
ensemble mean are projected to remain largely unchanged compared to the
historical period. This suggests that, under the considered climate scenarios,
the associated risk is expected to remain stable throughout the century.

Abstract: The evaluation of time series forecasting models is hindered by a critical
lack of high-quality benchmarks, leading to a potential illusion of progress.
Existing datasets suffer from issues ranging from pre-training data
contamination in the age of LLMs to the causal and description leakage
prevalent in early multimodal designs. To address this, we formalize the core
principles of high-fidelity benchmarking, focusing on data sourcing integrity,
strict causal soundness, and structural clarity. We introduce Fidel-TS, a new
large-scale benchmark built from the ground up on these principles by sourcing
data from live APIs. Our extensive experiments validate this approach by
exposing the critical biases and design limitations of prior benchmarks.
Furthermore, we conclusively demonstrate that the causal relevance of textual
information is the key factor in unlocking genuine performance gains in
multimodal forecasting.

TL;DR: 提出了DSAT-HD模型，通过混合分解机制、多尺度自适应通路和双流残差学习框架，解决了传统时间序列预测方法在捕获跨范围多样特征和处理复杂季节性方面的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于Transformer的时间序列预测方法主要建模有限时间序列或固定尺度，难以捕获跨不同范围的多样特征。传统分解方法如STL需要预定义季节性周期且通常只能处理单一固定季节性。

Method: 1) 混合分解机制：结合EMA和傅里叶分解与RevIN归一化，通过噪声Top-k门控动态平衡季节性和趋势分量；2) 多尺度自适应通路：利用稀疏分配器将特征路由到四个并行Transformer层，通过稀疏组合器合并特征，结合局部CNN和全局交互的混合注意力；3) 双流残差学习框架：CNN和MLP分支分别处理季节性和趋势分量，通过最小化专家协作方差的平衡损失函数协调。

Result: 在九个数据集上的广泛实验表明，DSAT-HD整体优于现有方法，并在某些数据集上达到最先进性能。在多种迁移场景下表现出更强的泛化能力。

Conclusion: DSAT-HD通过创新的混合分解、多尺度自适应和双流学习框架，有效解决了时间序列预测中的复杂季节性和跨尺度特征捕获问题，展现出优越的性能和泛化能力。

Abstract: Time series forecasting is crucial for various applications, such as weather,
traffic, electricity, and energy predictions. Currently, common time series
forecasting methods are based on Transformers. However, existing approaches
primarily model limited time series or fixed scales, making it more challenging
to capture diverse features cross different ranges. Additionally, traditional
methods like STL for complex seasonality-trend decomposition require
pre-specified seasonal periods and typically handle only single, fixed
seasonality. We propose the Hybrid Decomposition Dual-Stream Adaptive
Transformer (DSAT-HD), which integrates three key innovations to address the
limitations of existing methods: 1) A hybrid decomposition mechanism combining
EMA and Fourier decomposition with RevIN normalization, dynamically balancing
seasonal and trend components through noise Top-k gating; 2) A multi-scale
adaptive pathway leveraging a sparse allocator to route features to four
parallel Transformer layers, followed by feature merging via a sparse combiner,
enhanced by hybrid attention combining local CNNs and global interactions; 3) A
dual-stream residual learning framework where CNN and MLP branches separately
process seasonal and trend components, coordinated by a balanced loss function
minimizing expert collaboration variance. Extensive experiments on nine
datasets demonstrate that DSAT-HD outperforms existing methods overall and
achieves state-of-the-art performance on some datasets. Notably, it also
exhibits stronger generalization capabilities across various transfer
scenarios.

Abstract: A major challenge in physics-informed machine learning is to understand how
the incorporation of prior domain knowledge affects learning rates when data
are dependent. Focusing on empirical risk minimization with physics-informed
regularization, we derive complexity-dependent bounds on the excess risk in
probability and in expectation. We prove that, when the physical prior
information is aligned, the learning rate improves from the (slow) Sobolev
minimax rate to the (fast) optimal i.i.d. one without any sample-size deflation
due to data dependence.

Conclusion: DyMoDreamer通过动态调制机制有效提升了基于模型强化学习的性能，在样本效率和任务性能方面都取得了显著改进。

Abstract: A critical bottleneck in deep reinforcement learning (DRL) is sample
inefficiency, as training high-performance agents often demands extensive
environmental interactions. Model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) mitigates
this by building world models that simulate environmental dynamics and generate
synthetic experience, improving sample efficiency. However, conventional world
models process observations holistically, failing to decouple dynamic objects
and temporal features from static backgrounds. This approach is computationally
inefficient, especially for visual tasks where dynamic objects significantly
influence rewards and decision-making performance. To address this, we
introduce DyMoDreamer, a novel MBRL algorithm that incorporates a dynamic
modulation mechanism to improve the extraction of dynamic features and enrich
the temporal information. DyMoDreamer employs differential observations derived
from a novel inter-frame differencing mask, explicitly encoding object-level
motion cues and temporal dynamics. Dynamic modulation is modeled as stochastic
categorical distributions and integrated into a recurrent state-space model
(RSSM), enhancing the model's focus on reward-relevant dynamics. Experiments
demonstrate that DyMoDreamer sets a new state-of-the-art on the Atari $100$k
benchmark with a $156.6$\% mean human-normalized score, establishes a new
record of $832$ on the DeepMind Visual Control Suite, and gains a $9.5$\%
performance improvement after $1$M steps on the Crafter benchmark. Our code is
released at https://github.com/Ultraman-Tiga1/DyMoDreamer.

Abstract: Single-cell RNA sequencing has transformed biology by enabling the
measurement of gene expression at cellular resolution, providing information
for cell types, states, and disease contexts. Recently, single-cell foundation
models have emerged as powerful tools for learning transferable representations
directly from expression profiles, improving performance on classification and
clustering tasks. However, these models are limited to discrete prediction
heads, which collapse cellular complexity into predefined labels that fail to
capture the richer, contextual explanations biologists need. We introduce
Cell2Text, a multimodal generative framework that translates scRNA-seq profiles
into structured natural language descriptions. By integrating gene-level
embeddings from single-cell foundation models with pretrained large language
models, Cell2Text generates coherent summaries that capture cellular identity,
tissue origin, disease associations, and pathway activity, generalizing to
unseen cells. Empirically, Cell2Text outperforms baselines on classification
accuracy, demonstrates strong ontological consistency using PageRank-based
similarity metrics, and achieves high semantic fidelity in text generation.
These results demonstrate that coupling expression data with natural language
offers both stronger predictive performance and inherently interpretable
outputs, pointing to a scalable path for label-efficient characterization of
unseen cells.

Result: 逻辑回归准确率90.0%，随机森林90.4%，XGBoost 90.3%。流行度是最强预测因子，乐器度、情感价、时长和语音度也有显著贡献。

Conclusion: 流行度是预测Billboard Hot 100入选的最决定性因素，机器学习模型能够以高准确率预测歌曲的商业成功。

Abstract: The advent of digital streaming platforms have recently revolutionized the
landscape of music industry, with the ensuing digitalization providing
structured data collections that open new research avenues for investigating
popularity dynamics and mainstream success. The present work explored which
determinants hold the strongest predictive influence for a track's inclusion in
the Billboard Hot 100 charts, including streaming popularity, measurable audio
signal attributes, and probabilistic indicators of human listening. The
analysis revealed that popularity was by far the most decisive predictor of
Billboard Hot 100 inclusion, with considerable contribution from
instrumentalness, valence, duration and speechiness. Logistic Regression
achieved 90.0% accuracy, with very high recall for charting singles (0.986) but
lower recall for non-charting ones (0.813), yielding balanced F1-scores around
0.90. Random Forest slightly improved performance to 90.4% accuracy,
maintaining near-perfect precision for non-charting singles (0.990) and high
recall for charting ones (0.992), with F1-scores up to 0.91. Gradient Boosting
(XGBoost) reached 90.3% accuracy, delivering a more balanced trade-off by
improving recall for non-charting singles (0.837) while sustaining high recall
for charting ones (0.969), resulting in F1-scores comparable to the other
models.

### [285] [DRIFT-Net: A Spectral--Coupled Neural Operator for PDEs Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24868)
*Jiayi Li,Flora D. Salim*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DRIFT-Net提出了一种双分支网络架构，通过谱分支捕获全局低频信息，图像分支处理局部细节，解决了现有PDE基础模型中全局耦合弱化的问题，在Navier-Stokes基准测试中显著降低了误差并提高了效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的PDE基础模型主要采用多尺度窗口自注意力机制，但由于其局部性，真正的全局谱耦合只能通过深度堆叠和窗口移动逐步传播，这削弱了全局耦合，导致闭环推演中的误差累积和漂移。

Method: 采用双分支设计：谱分支负责捕获全局大尺度低频信息，图像分支专注于局部细节和非平稳结构。首先在低频范围内进行受控轻量级混合，然后通过带权加权融合谱路径和图像路径，避免简单拼接导致的宽度膨胀和训练不稳定。

Result: 在Navier-Stokes基准测试中，相对L1误差降低了7%-54%，参数数量减少约15%，吞吐量仍高于scOT基准模型。消融研究和理论分析进一步验证了该设计的稳定性和有效性。

Conclusion: DRIFT-Net通过双分支架构有效解决了PDE求解器中全局耦合弱化的问题，在保持高吞吐量的同时显著降低了误差，为PDE动力学学习提供了更稳定高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Learning PDE dynamics with neural solvers can significantly improve
wall-clock efficiency and accuracy compared with classical numerical solvers.
In recent years, foundation models for PDEs have largely adopted multi-scale
windowed self-attention, with the scOT backbone in \textsc{Poseidon} serving as
a representative example.
  However, because of their locality, truly globally consistent spectral
coupling can only be propagated gradually through deep stacking and window
shifting. This weakens global coupling and leads to error accumulation and
drift during closed-loop rollouts. To address this, we propose
\textbf{DRIFT-Net}. It employs a dual-branch design comprising a spectral
branch and an image branch. The spectral branch is responsible for capturing
global, large-scale low-frequency information, whereas the image branch focuses
on local details and nonstationary structures. Specifically, we first perform
controlled, lightweight mixing within the low-frequency range. Then we fuse the
spectral and image paths at each layer via bandwise weighting, which avoids the
width inflation and training instability caused by naive concatenation. The
fused result is transformed back into the spatial domain and added to the image
branch, thereby preserving both global structure and high-frequency details
across scales. Compared with strong attention-based baselines, DRIFT-Net
achieves lower error and higher throughput with fewer parameters under
identical training settings and budget. On Navier--Stokes benchmarks, the
relative $L_{1}$ error is reduced by 7\%--54\%, the parameter count decreases
by about 15\%, and the throughput remains higher than scOT. Ablation studies
and theoretical analyses further demonstrate the stability and effectiveness of
this design. The code is available at

Abstract: Uncertainty quantification is essential in human-machine collaboration, as
human agents tend to adjust their decisions based on the confidence of the
machine counterpart. Reliably calibrated model uncertainties, hence, enable
more effective collaboration, targeted expert intervention and more responsible
usage of Machine Learning (ML) systems. Conformal prediction has become a well
established model-agnostic framework for uncertainty calibration of ML models,
offering statistically valid confidence estimates for both regression and
classification tasks. In this work, we apply conformal prediction to
$\textit{SoilNet}$, a multimodal multitask model for describing soil profiles.
We design a simulated human-in-the-loop (HIL) annotation pipeline, where a
limited budget for obtaining ground truth annotations from domain experts is
available when model uncertainty is high. Our experiments show that
conformalizing SoilNet leads to more efficient annotation in regression tasks
and comparable performance scores in classification tasks under the same
annotation budget when tested against its non-conformal counterpart. All code

Abstract: Neural scaling laws underlie many of the recent advances in deep learning,
yet their theoretical understanding remains largely confined to linear models.
In this work, we present a systematic analysis of scaling laws for quadratic
and diagonal neural networks in the feature learning regime. Leveraging
connections with matrix compressed sensing and LASSO, we derive a detailed
phase diagram for the scaling exponents of the excess risk as a function of
sample complexity and weight decay. This analysis uncovers crossovers between
distinct scaling regimes and plateau behaviors, mirroring phenomena widely
reported in the empirical neural scaling literature. Furthermore, we establish
a precise link between these regimes and the spectral properties of the trained
network weights, which we characterize in detail. As a consequence, we provide
a theoretical validation of recent empirical observations connecting the
emergence of power-law tails in the weight spectrum with network generalization
performance, yielding an interpretation from first principles.

Abstract: Canonicalization is a widely used strategy in equivariant machine learning,
enforcing symmetry in neural networks by mapping each input to a standard form.
Yet, it often introduces discontinuities that can affect stability during
training, limit generalization, and complicate universal approximation
theorems. In this paper, we address this by introducing \emph{adaptive
canonicalization}, a general framework in which the canonicalization depends
both on the input and the network. Specifically, we present the adaptive
canonicalization based on prior maximization, where the standard form of the
input is chosen to maximize the predictive confidence of the network. We prove
that this construction yields continuous and symmetry-respecting models that
admit universal approximation properties.
  We propose two applications of our setting: (i) resolving eigenbasis
ambiguities in spectral graph neural networks, and (ii) handling rotational
symmetries in point clouds. We empirically validate our methods on molecular
and protein classification, as well as point cloud classification tasks. Our
adaptive canonicalization outperforms the three other common solutions to
equivariant machine learning: data augmentation, standard canonicalization, and
equivariant architectures.

<details>

Motivation: 理解蛋白质语言模型如何将整个序列空间及其关系转换为隐藏表示，目前缺乏对PLMs转换整个序列空间方式的理解。

Method: 使用平方根速度表示和图形过滤方法，在SCOP数据集上分析不同蛋白质，研究ESM2模型中Karcher均值和有效维度的变化模式。

Result: PLMs优先编码残基间的即时和局部关系，但在较大上下文长度时性能下降；最结构忠实的编码出现在接近但早于最后一层的位置。

Conclusion: 在PLMs接近但早于最后一层的表示上训练折叠模型可能会提高折叠性能。

Abstract: While protein language models (PLMs) are one of the most promising avenues of
research for future de novo protein design, the way in which they transform
sequences to hidden representations, as well as the information encoded in such
representations is yet to be fully understood. Several works have attempted to
propose interpretability tools for PLMs, but they have focused on understanding
how individual sequences are transformed by such models. Therefore, the way in
which PLMs transform the whole space of sequences along with their relations is
still unknown. In this work we attempt to understand this transformed space of
sequences by identifying protein structure and representation with square-root
velocity (SRV) representations and graph filtrations. Both approaches naturally
lead to a metric space in which pairs of proteins or protein representations
can be compared with each other.
  We analyze different types of proteins from the SCOP dataset and show that
the Karcher mean and effective dimension of the SRV shape space follow a
non-linear pattern as a function of the layers in ESM2 models of different
sizes. Furthermore, we use graph filtrations as a tool to study the context
lengths at which models encode the structural features of proteins. We find
that PLMs preferentially encode immediate as well as local relations between
residues, but start to degrade for larger context lengths. The most
structurally faithful encoding tends to occur close to, but before the last
layer of the models, indicating that training a folding model ontop of these
layers might lead to improved folding performance.

Motivation: 虽然LLMs有潜力成为自主智能体，但在序列决策中探索效率低下。现有研究通过SFT或RL改进多臂老虎机任务中的遗憾值，但尚不清楚这些方法如何塑造探索策略及其泛化能力。

Method: 使用专家轨迹进行SFT训练，以及使用包括策略性遗憾形奖励和算法奖励在内的多种定制奖励信号进行RL训练。

Result: 训练后的智能体优于预训练模型，性能与UCB和Thompson Sampling相当，在6倍更长时域和跨老虎机家族中表现出稳健泛化能力。行为分析显示性能提升主要来自更复杂但更贪婪的利用策略。

Conclusion: 研究阐明了每种训练范式的适用场景，建议超越平均遗憾的定制奖励设计和评估，以促进稳健的探索行为。

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) hold promise to become autonomous agents,
they often explore suboptimally in sequential decision-making. Recent work has
sought to enhance this capability via supervised fine-tuning (SFT) or
reinforcement learning (RL), improving regret on the classic multi-armed bandit
task. However, it remains unclear how these learning methods shape exploration
strategies and how well they generalize. We investigate both paradigms by
training LLMs with SFT on expert trajectories and RL with a range of tailored
reward signals including a strategic, regret-shaped reward to reduce variance,
and an algorithmic reward that enables oracle imitation. The resulting agents
outperform pre-trained models and achieve performance comparable to Upper
Confidence Bound (UCB) and Thompson Sampling, with robust generalization to 6x
longer horizons and across bandit families. Behavioral analysis reveals that
gains often stem from more sophisticated but greedier exploitation: RL/SFT
agents are more prone to early catastrophic failure than pre-trained models,
prematurely abandoning exploration. Furthermore, agents trained to imitate UCB
learn to outperform their teacher by adopting more exploitative variants. Our
findings clarify when each training paradigm is preferable and advocate
tailored reward design and evaluation beyond average regret to promote robust
exploratory behavior.

TL;DR: 本研究探索了在抗体贝叶斯优化中整合结构信息的方法，并与仅使用序列的方法进行比较。发现结构信息在早期优化阶段能提高稳定性优化的数据效率，但峰值性能相当。通过引入蛋白质语言模型的软约束，序列方法可以达到与结构方法相当的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 抗体治疗特性的工程化通常是迭代且昂贵的，贝叶斯优化是自然选择。然而，在高度结构化的抗体空间中为优化选择合适的代理模型很困难，且可能因优化特性而异。目前没有工作尝试将结构信息整合到抗体贝叶斯优化中。

Method: 探索了将结构信息整合到贝叶斯优化的不同方法，并与多种仅序列方法在抗体结合亲和力和稳定性两个特性上进行比较。提出了基于蛋白质语言模型的"软约束"来引导优化到有前景的空间区域。

Result: 某些类型的结构信息在早期优化轮次中提高了稳定性的数据效率，但峰值性能相当。当加入蛋白质语言模型软约束后，亲和力的数据效率差距减小，稳定性的差距消除，序列方法能够匹配结构方法的性能。

Conclusion: 研究结果表明，在贝叶斯优化中结构信息对于抗体的必要性值得质疑，因为通过适当的软约束，仅使用序列信息的方法可以达到与结构方法相当的性能。

Abstract: Bayesian optimization is a natural candidate for the engineering of antibody
therapeutic properties, which is often iterative and expensive. However,
finding the optimal choice of surrogate model for optimization over the highly
structured antibody space is difficult, and may differ depending on the
property being optimized. Moreover, to the best of our knowledge, no prior
works have attempted to incorporate structural information into antibody
Bayesian optimization. In this work, we explore different approaches to
incorporating structural information into Bayesian optimization, and compare
them to a variety of sequence-only approaches on two different antibody
properties, binding affinity and stability. In addition, we propose the use of
a protein language model-based ``soft constraint,'' which helps guide the
optimization to promising regions of the space. We find that certain types of
structural information improve data efficiency in early optimization rounds for
stability, but have equivalent peak performance. Moreover, when incorporating
the protein language model soft constraint we find that the data efficiency gap
is diminished for affinity and eliminated for stability, resulting in
sequence-only methods that match the performance of structure-based methods,
raising questions about the necessity of structure in Bayesian optimization for
antibodies.

Conclusion: OAT-FM为流匹配提供了新的理论视角和实践方法，通过最优加速传输实现了更有效的生成模型训练。

Abstract: As a powerful technique in generative modeling, Flow Matching (FM) aims to
learn velocity fields from noise to data, which is often explained and
implemented as solving Optimal Transport (OT) problems. In this study, we
bridge FM and the recent theory of Optimal Acceleration Transport (OAT),
developing an improved FM method called OAT-FM and exploring its benefits in
both theory and practice. In particular, we demonstrate that the straightening
objective hidden in existing OT-based FM methods is mathematically equivalent
to minimizing the physical action associated with acceleration defined by OAT.
Accordingly, instead of enforcing constant velocity, OAT-FM optimizes the
acceleration transport in the product space of sample and velocity, whose
objective corresponds to a necessary and sufficient condition of flow
straightness. An efficient algorithm is designed to achieve OAT-FM with low
complexity. OAT-FM motivates a new two-phase FM paradigm: Given a generative
model trained by an arbitrary FM method, whose velocity information has been
relatively reliable, we can fine-tune and improve it via OAT-FM. This paradigm
eliminates the risk of data distribution drift and the need to generate a large
number of noise data pairs, which consistently improves model performance in
various generative tasks. Code is available at:

Conclusion: 通过减少特征表示的相关性，提出的方法能够显著提升线性函数逼近在迁移学习中的效果，从而降低计算成本。

Abstract: Deep Reinforcement Learning (RL) has demonstrated success in solving complex
sequential decision-making problems by integrating neural networks with the RL
framework. However, training deep RL models poses several challenges, such as
the need for extensive hyperparameter tuning and high computational costs.
Transfer learning has emerged as a promising strategy to address these
challenges by enabling the reuse of knowledge from previously learned tasks for
new, related tasks. This avoids the need for retraining models entirely from
scratch. A commonly used approach for transfer learning in RL is to leverage
the internal representations learned by the neural network during training.
Specifically, the activations from the last hidden layer can be viewed as
refined state representations that encapsulate the essential features of the
input. In this work, we investigate whether these representations can be used
as input for training simpler models, such as linear function approximators, on
new tasks. We observe that the representations learned by standard deep RL
models can be highly correlated, which limits their effectiveness when used
with linear function approximation. To mitigate this problem, we propose a
novel deep Q-learning approach that introduces a regularization term to reduce
positive correlations between feature representation of states. By leveraging
these reduced correlated features, we enable more effective use of linear
function approximation in transfer learning. Through experiments and ablation
studies on standard RL benchmarks and MinAtar games, we demonstrate the
efficacy of our approach in improving transfer learning performance and thereby
reducing computational overhead.

Motivation: 现有推理算法（如思维链和多分支推理）显著增加令牌使用和延迟，而之前的工作主要关注减少令牌使用但牺牲准确性。

Method: 使用轻量级线性探测模型预测分支正确性，编排策略决定终止、复制或继续分支；在多请求时根据提示复杂度优先处理简单任务。

Result: 在三个推理基准测试中，DUCHESS将令牌使用减少42-63%，在vLLM服务中平均延迟减少57-81%，中位数延迟减少58-85%，尾部延迟减少52-84%。

Conclusion: DUCHESS通过智能分支编排和难度感知调度，在不牺牲准确性的前提下显著降低了LLM推理的令牌使用和延迟。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly rely on inference-time reasoning
algorithms such as chain-of-thought and multi-branch reasoning to improve
accuracy on complex tasks. These methods, however, substantially increase token
usage and per-request latency. Prior work has largely focused on reducing token
usage, often at the expense of accuracy, while overlooking other latency
factors. We present DUCHESS, an LLM serving system that reduces cost and
latency without sacrificing accuracy through intra-request branch orchestration
guided by predictions. DUCHESS employs a lightweight linear probing model over
LLM layer activations to estimate branch correctness, and its orchestration
policy decides whether to terminate, duplicate, or continue a branch. When
handling multiple requests, DUCHESS further reduces latency by prioritizing
easier reasoning tasks when complexity can be estimated from the prompt.
Experiments on three reasoning benchmarks show that DUCHESS consistently
improves the token-accuracy Pareto frontier, reducing token usage by 42-63% at
matched accuracy compared to self-consistency. In serving with vLLM, DUCHESS
reduces mean, median, and tail latencies by 57-81%, 58-85%, and 52-84% with
First-Come-First-Served scheduling, and achieves additional gains under
difficulty-aware scheduling at higher request rates.

Motivation: 现有CATE估计方法在低重叠区域表现不佳，需要改进元学习器在低重叠情况下的性能。

Method: 引入重叠自适应正则化(OAR)，根据重叠权重比例调整正则化强度，在低重叠区域施加更强的正则化。该方法适用于参数和非参数二阶模型，并提出了去偏版本以保持Neyman正交性。

Result: 通过(半)合成实验证明，OAR相比恒定正则化在低重叠设置下显著改善了CATE估计性能。

Conclusion: OAR是首个在元学习器正则化项中利用重叠权重的方法，能有效提升低重叠区域的CATE估计效果。

Abstract: The conditional average treatment effect (CATE) is widely used in
personalized medicine to inform therapeutic decisions. However,
state-of-the-art methods for CATE estimation (so-called meta-learners) often
perform poorly in the presence of low overlap. In this work, we introduce a new
approach to tackle this issue and improve the performance of existing
meta-learners in the low-overlap regions. Specifically, we introduce
Overlap-Adaptive Regularization (OAR) that regularizes target models
proportionally to overlap weights so that, informally, the regularization is
higher in regions with low overlap. To the best of our knowledge, our OAR is
the first approach to leverage overlap weights in the regularization terms of
the meta-learners. Our OAR approach is flexible and works with any existing
CATE meta-learner: we demonstrate how OAR can be applied to both parametric and
non-parametric second-stage models. Furthermore, we propose debiased versions
of our OAR that preserve the Neyman-orthogonality of existing meta-learners and
thus ensure more robust inference. Through a series of (semi-)synthetic
experiments, we demonstrate that our OAR significantly improves CATE estimation
in low-overlap settings in comparison to constant regularization.

Method: 利用双下降现象全面比较离散扩散模型和自回归模型的样本效率，分析它们在欠参数化和过参数化阶段的表现

Result: 离散扩散模型需要更大容量和更多训练轮次才能达到插值阈值；在强过参数化阶段，两种模型表现相似，都没有明显的测试损失第二下降；自回归模型在小规模数据集上更样本高效

Conclusion: 自回归模型在小规模数据集上更样本高效，离散扩散模型只有在获得足够容量和计算资源时才能具有竞争力

Abstract: Data scarcity drives the need for more sample-efficient large language
models. In this work, we use the double descent phenomenon to holistically
compare the sample efficiency of discrete diffusion and autoregressive models.
We show that discrete diffusion models require larger capacity and more
training epochs to escape their underparameterized regime and reach the
interpolation threshold. In the strongly overparameterized regime, both models
exhibit similar behavior, with neither exhibiting a pronounced second descent
in test loss across a large range of model sizes. Overall, our results indicate
that autoregressive models are more sample-efficient on small-scale datasets,
while discrete diffusion models only become competitive when given sufficient
capacity and compute.

Abstract: RL with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has emerged as a promising paradigm for
improving the reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs). Current
methods rely primarily on policy optimization frameworks like PPO and GRPO,
which follow generalized policy iteration that alternates between evaluating
the current policy's value and improving the policy based on evaluation. While
effective, they often suffer from training instability and diversity collapse,
requiring complex heuristic tricks and careful tuning. We observe that standard
RLVR in math reasoning can be formalized as a specialized finite-horizon Markov
Decision Process with deterministic state transitions, tree-structured
dynamics, and binary terminal rewards. Though large in scale, the underlying
structure is simpler than general-purpose control settings for which popular RL
algorithms (e.g., PPO) were developed, suggesting that several sophisticated
techniques in existing methods may be reduced or even omitted. Based on this
insight, we prove a surprising result: the optimal action can be recovered from
the Q-function of a fixed uniformly random policy, thereby bypassing the
generalized policy iteration loop and its associated heuristics. We introduce
Random Policy Valuation for Diverse Reasoning (ROVER) to translate this
principle into a practical and scalable algorithm for LLM math reasoning, a
minimalist yet highly effective RL method that samples actions from a softmax
over these uniform-policy Q-values. ROVER preserves diversity throughout
training, allowing sustained exploration of multiple valid pathways. Across
multiple base models and standard math reasoning benchmarks, ROVER demonstrates
superior performance in both \textbf{quality} (\textbf{+8.2} on pass@1,
\textbf{+16.8} on pass@256) and \textbf{diversity} (\textbf{+17.6\%}), despite
its radical simplification compared to strong, complicated existing methods.

TL;DR: 从函数空间角度重新审视PPO算法，在再生核希尔伯特空间(RKHS)中解耦策略评估和改进，提出核化TD评论家和KL正则化自然梯度策略更新，获得非渐近理论保证和最优收敛速率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为PPO算法提供超越有限维假设的更坚实理论基础，阐明RKHS近端更新与核TD评论家何时能实现全局策略改进并保持实际效率。

Method: 在RKHS中解耦策略评估和改进：(1)使用核化TD评论家进行高效RKHS梯度更新；(2)KL正则化自然梯度策略步长，恢复PPO/TRPO风格的近端更新。

Result: 获得非渐近、实例自适应的理论保证，收敛速率依赖于RKHS熵；经验证明理论对齐的调度在控制任务中提高稳定性和样本效率，TD评论家在吞吐量上优于GAE基线。

Conclusion: 该工作为PPO建立了更坚实的理论基础，阐明了RKHS近端更新与核TD评论家在全局策略改进和实际效率方面的适用条件。

Abstract: We revisit Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) from a function-space
perspective. Our analysis decouples policy evaluation and improvement in a
reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS): (i) A kernelized temporal-difference
(TD) critic performs efficient RKHS-gradient updates using only one-step
state-action transition samples; (ii) a KL-regularized, natural-gradient policy
step exponentiates the evaluated action-value, recovering a PPO/TRPO-style
proximal update in continuous state-action spaces. We provide non-asymptotic,
instance-adaptive guarantees whose rates depend on RKHS entropy, unifying
tabular, linear, Sobolev, Gaussian, and Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) regimes,
and we derive a sampling rule for the proximal update that ensures the optimal
$k^{-1/2}$ convergence rate for stochastic optimization. Empirically, the
theory-aligned schedule improves stability and sample efficiency on common
control tasks (e.g., CartPole, Acrobot), while our TD-based critic attains
favorable throughput versus a GAE baseline. Altogether, our results place PPO
on a firmer theoretical footing beyond finite-dimensional assumptions and
clarify when RKHS-proximal updates with kernel-TD critics yield global policy
improvement with practical efficiency.

<details>

Motivation: 扩散模型可能无意中泄露训练样本的成员信息，存在严重的隐私风险，需要研究成员推理攻击的理论基础和实际效果

Method: 基于扩散模型预测噪声向量指向训练样本局部均值的理论观察，提出SimA单查询攻击方法，分析不同扩散模型变体的安全性差异

Result: SimA在DDPM和LDM等模型上表现一致强劲，发现潜在扩散模型由于VAE的信息瓶颈而更安全，通过调整β-VAE超参数可增强LDM训练对MIA的鲁棒性

Conclusion: 巩固了基于分数的成员推理攻击理论，强调需要更好理解VAE反演而非仅扩散过程反演，为潜在扩散方法的安全性提供了新见解

Abstract: Membership inference attacks (MIAs) against diffusion models have emerged as
a pressing privacy concern, as these models may inadvertently reveal whether a
given sample was part of their training set. We present a theoretical and
empirical study of score-based MIAs, focusing on the predicted noise vectors
that diffusion models learn to approximate. We show that the expected denoiser
output points toward a kernel-weighted local mean of nearby training samples,
such that its norm encodes proximity to the training set and thereby reveals
membership. Building on this observation, we propose SimA, a single-query
attack that provides a principled, efficient alternative to existing
multi-query methods. SimA achieves consistently strong performance across
variants of DDPM, Latent Diffusion Model (LDM). Notably, we find that Latent
Diffusion Models are surprisingly less vulnerable than pixel-space models, due
to the strong information bottleneck imposed by their latent auto-encoder. We
further investigate this by differing the regularization hyperparameters
($\beta$ in $\beta$-VAE) in latent channel and suggest a strategy to make LDM
training more robust to MIA. Our results solidify the theory of score-based
MIAs, while highlighting that Latent Diffusion class of methods requires better
understanding of inversion for VAE, and not simply inversion of the Diffusion
process

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 野火是严重的自然灾害，深度学习在野火预测中显示出潜力，但由于缺乏不确定性量化，其可靠性受到质疑，阻碍了实际应用。

Method: 开发了一个不确定性感知的深度学习框架，能够同时捕捉认知不确定性（模型不确定性）和偶然不确定性（数据不确定性），用于短期野火危险预测。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提高了野火危险预测的准确性和可靠性，推进了可信赖野火深度学习系统的发展，两种不确定性类型在具有挑战性的条件下提供互补见解。

Abstract: Wildfires are among the most severe natural hazards, posing a significant
threat to both humans and natural ecosystems. The growing risk of wildfires
increases the demand for forecasting models that are not only accurate but also
reliable. Deep Learning (DL) has shown promise in predicting wildfire danger;
however, its adoption is hindered by concerns over the reliability of its
predictions, some of which stem from the lack of uncertainty quantification. To
address this challenge, we present an uncertainty-aware DL framework that
jointly captures epistemic (model) and aleatoric (data) uncertainty to enhance
short-term wildfire danger forecasting. In the next-day forecasting, our
best-performing model improves the F1 Score by 2.3% and reduces the Expected
Calibration Error by 2.1% compared to a deterministic baseline, enhancing both
predictive skill and calibration. Our experiments confirm the reliability of
the uncertainty estimates and illustrate their practical utility for decision
support, including the identification of uncertainty thresholds for rejecting
low-confidence predictions and the generation of well-calibrated wildfire
danger maps with accompanying uncertainty layers. Extending the forecast
horizon up to ten days, we observe that aleatoric uncertainty increases with
time, showing greater variability in environmental conditions, while epistemic
uncertainty remains stable. Finally, we show that although the two uncertainty
types may be redundant in low-uncertainty cases, they provide complementary
insights under more challenging conditions, underscoring the value of their
joint modeling for robust wildfire danger prediction. In summary, our approach
significantly improves the accuracy and reliability of wildfire danger
forecasting, advancing the development of trustworthy wildfire DL systems.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MARCOS提出了一种新的LLM推理范式，将推理建模为连续高维思想的隐马尔可夫链，替代传统的token序列生成，实现了更高效和灵活的推理过程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统链式思维推理存在三个主要问题：推理速度慢且计算成本高、受限于离散token空间、推理与token生成耦合导致短视推理。

Method: 将推理建模为连续高维思想的隐马尔可夫链，使用两阶段变分训练方案，让显式推理步骤作为隐式思想的观察窗口。

Result: 在三个基准测试中，MARCOS性能达到token-based CoT水平，在GSM8K上甚至超越4.7%，推理速度提升高达15.7倍。

Conclusion: MARCOS为LLM推理提供了新的连续推理范式，支持步骤级控制随机性，为强化学习和推理开辟了重要机会。

Abstract: The current paradigm for reasoning in large language models (LLMs) involves
models "thinking out loud" via a sequence of tokens, known as chain-of-thought
(CoT). This approach, while effective, has several significant drawbacks.
Firstly, inference requires autoregressive generation of often thousands of CoT
tokens, which is slow and computationally expensive. Secondly, it constrains
reasoning to the discrete space of tokens, creating an information bottleneck
across reasoning steps. Thirdly, it fundamentally entangles reasoning with
token generation, forcing LLMs to "think while speaking," which causes
potentially short-sighted reasoning. In light of these limitations, we
re-imagine reasoning in LLMs and present a new paradigm: MARCOS. In our
approach, rather than autoregressively generating tokens, we model reasoning as
a hidden Markov chain of continuous, high-dimensional "thoughts". Each
reasoning step involves a transition of the internal thoughts, where explicit
reasoning steps (which may consist of hundreds of tokens) serve as observable
variables, which are windows to peek into the implicit thoughts. Since this
latent process is incompatible with the standard supervised learning, we
further propose a two-phase variational training scheme. Our experiments on
three benchmarks demonstrate that MARCOS outperforms existing continuous
reasoning methods and, for the first time, achieves performance comparable to
token-based CoT, even surpassing it by 4.7% on GSM8K with up to 15.7x speedup
in inference. Beyond this, MARCOS offers additional advantages, such as
step-level instead of token-level control over randomness, opening significant
opportunities for reinforcement learning and reasoning in LLMs.

Conclusion: 该框架能够显著降低成本和排放，通过避免不必要的分析和物理干预，为整个基础设施组合提供快速、不确定性感知的分类筛选。

Abstract: Aging infrastructure portfolios pose a critical resource allocation
challenge: deciding which structures require intervention and which can safely
remain in service. Structural assessments must balance the trade-off between
cheaper, conservative analysis methods and accurate but costly simulations that
do not scale portfolio-wide. We propose Bayesian neural network (BNN)
surrogates for rapid structural pre-assessment of worldwide common bridge
types, such as reinforced concrete frame bridges. Trained on a large-scale
database of non-linear finite element analyses generated via a parametric
pipeline and developed based on the Swiss Federal Railway's bridge portfolio,
the models accurately and efficiently estimate high-fidelity structural
analysis results by predicting code compliance factors with calibrated
epistemic uncertainty. Our BNN surrogate enables fast, uncertainty-aware
triage: flagging likely critical structures and providing guidance where
refined analysis is pertinent. We demonstrate the framework's effectiveness in
a real-world case study of a railway underpass, showing its potential to
significantly reduce costs and emissions by avoiding unnecessary analyses and
physical interventions across entire infrastructure portfolios.

Motivation: 研究transformer模型在推理过程中token随网络深度演化的动态特性，通过物理系统类比来理解其内部工作机制。

Method: 将token建模为平均场相互作用粒子系统，在N个token数量大且逆温度参数β与N共同缩放的机制下，分析系统的多尺度动态行为。

Result: 发现系统动态呈现三个尺度：快速阶段token经验测度坍缩到低维空间，中间阶段进一步坍缩成簇，慢速阶段簇顺序合并成单一簇。

Conclusion: 严格刻画了每个阶段的极限动态，证明了上述极限下的收敛性，并通过模拟验证了结果。

Abstract: In this paper, we study the evolution of tokens through the depth of
encoder-only transformer models at inference time by modeling them as a system
of particles interacting in a mean-field way and studying the corresponding
dynamics. More specifically, we consider this problem in the moderate
interaction regime, where the number $N$ of tokens is large and the inverse
temperature parameter $\beta$ of the model scales together with $N$. In this
regime, the dynamics of the system displays a multiscale behavior: a fast
phase, where the token empirical measure collapses on a low-dimensional space,
an intermediate phase, where the measure further collapses into clusters, and a
slow one, where such clusters sequentially merge into a single one. We provide
a rigorous characterization of the limiting dynamics in each of these phases
and prove convergence in the above mentioned limit, exemplifying our results
with some simulations.

Motivation: 随着超参数调优在规模化应用中成本越来越高，需要建立指导超参数调优的原则，但现有原则有限。

Method: 研究多种超参数（批量大小、学习率、权重衰减），识别轨迹不变性现象，即预训练损失曲线、梯度噪声和梯度范数在结合学习率和权重衰减的某个量上表现出不变性。

Result: 轨迹不变性将原始二维超参数空间降为一维，提出了高效的调优规则，并改进了之前的缩放定律，挑战了多个现有观点。

Conclusion: 该工作提出了新的高效调优原则，并为未来缩放定律研究提供了启示。

Abstract: As hyperparameter tuning becomes increasingly costly at scale, efficient
tuning methods are essential. Yet principles for guiding hyperparameter tuning
remain limited. In this work, we seek to establish such principles by
considering a broad range of hyperparameters, including batch size, learning
rate, and weight decay. We identify a phenomenon we call trajectory invariance,
where pre-training loss curves, gradient noise, and gradient norm exhibit
invariance--closely overlapping--with respect to a quantity that combines
learning rate and weight decay. This phenomenon effectively reduces the
original two-dimensional hyperparameter space to one dimension, yielding an
efficient tuning rule: follow the salient direction revealed by trajectory
invariance. Furthermore, we refine previous scaling laws and challenge several
existing viewpoints. Overall, our work proposes new principles for efficient
tuning and inspires future research on scaling laws.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有扩散模型强化学习方法（如DDPO）使用与预训练不同的目标函数，导致方差增加和收敛缓慢。本文旨在统一预训练和强化学习的目标。

Method: AWM使用与预训练相同的score/flow-matching损失，通过优势函数对样本进行加权，提升高奖励样本的影响，抑制低奖励样本。

Result: 在GenEval、OCR和PickScore基准测试中，AWM相比Flow-GRPO实现了高达24倍的加速，且不损害生成质量。

Conclusion: AWM通过统一预训练和强化学习目标，在理论和实践中都取得了显著改进，为扩散模型的强化学习提供了更高效的方法。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has emerged as a central paradigm for advancing
Large Language Models (LLMs), where pre-training and RL post-training share the
same log-likelihood formulation. In contrast, recent RL approaches for
diffusion models, most notably Denoising Diffusion Policy Optimization (DDPO),
optimize an objective different from the pretraining objectives--score/flow
matching loss. In this work, we establish a novel theoretical analysis: DDPO is
an implicit form of score/flow matching with noisy targets, which increases
variance and slows convergence. Building on this analysis, we introduce
\textbf{Advantage Weighted Matching (AWM)}, a policy-gradient method for
diffusion. It uses the same score/flow-matching loss as pretraining to obtain a
lower-variance objective and reweights each sample by its advantage. In effect,
AWM raises the influence of high-reward samples and suppresses low-reward ones
while keeping the modeling objective identical to pretraining. This unifies
pretraining and RL conceptually and practically, is consistent with
policy-gradient theory, reduces variance, and yields faster convergence. This
simple yet effective design yields substantial benefits: on GenEval, OCR, and
PickScore benchmarks, AWM delivers up to a $24\times$ speedup over Flow-GRPO
(which builds on DDPO), when applied to Stable Diffusion 3.5 Medium and FLUX,
without compromising generation quality. Code is available at

Abstract: Data-driven models are increasingly adopted in critical scientific fields
like weather forecasting and fluid dynamics. These methods can fail on
out-of-distribution (OOD) data, but detecting such failures in regression tasks
is an open challenge. We propose a new OOD detection method based on estimating
joint likelihoods using a score-based diffusion model. This approach considers
not just the input but also the regression model's prediction, providing a
task-aware reliability score. Across numerous scientific datasets, including
PDE datasets, satellite imagery and brain tumor segmentation, we show that this
likelihood strongly correlates with prediction error. Our work provides a
foundational step towards building a verifiable 'certificate of trust', thereby
offering a practical tool for assessing the trustworthiness of AI-based
scientific predictions. Our code is publicly available at

Motivation: 探索在实用扩展配方下，LLM训练损失曲线的坍缩现象是否成立，以及如何利用这种现象来改进训练效率。

Method: 通过分析不同规模LLM在最优超参数设置下的训练损失曲线，验证坍缩现象，并应用于训练病理诊断和超参数调优。

Result: 发现当优化超参数根据数据预算最优设置时，损失曲线确实会坍缩，这可以作为计算高效训练的标志。

Conclusion: 损失曲线坍缩现象是开发高效LLM的有效工具，通过训练Celerity LLM家族验证了这一方法的实用性。

Abstract: Effective LLM training relies on *consistency*, meaning that key quantities
-- such as final losses and optimal hyperparameters -- scale predictably across
model sizes. Qiu et al. (2025) recently showed that this consistency extends
beyond scalars: whole training loss curves can *collapse* onto a universal
trajectory after a simple normalization. What remains unclear is whether this
phenomenon holds for LLM families trained under *practical scaling recipes*,
where width, depth, learning rate, batch size, and weight decay are scaled
jointly. We show that it does: loss curves collapse across scales precisely
when optimization hyperparameters are set optimally for the given data budget,
in accordance with recent empirical scaling laws. Collapse thus emerges as a
signature of compute-efficient training. We demonstrate two applications at
scale: (1) deviation-from-collapse provides a sensitive, early diagnostic of
training pathologies, and (2) the predictability of collapsed curves enables
early stopping in large-scale hyperparameter tuning. Finally, we train a
competitive LLM family, *Celerity*, using these insights, highlighting collapse
as an effective tool for developing efficient LLMs.

Motivation: X射线ptychography是一种数据密集型成像技术，需要实时反馈。现有深度学习方法在不同实验条件下缺乏鲁棒性，需要一种能够跨实验条件泛化的重建模型。

Method: 采用无监督训练工作流程，重点进行探针学习，将实验测量的探针与程序生成的合成物体相结合，训练物理信息神经网络。

Conclusion: 提出的探针中心方法能够训练实验导向模型，在动态实验条件下提供实时反馈，解决了现有深度学习方法缺乏跨实验条件鲁棒性的问题。

Abstract: X-ray ptychography is a data-intensive imaging technique expected to become
ubiquitous at next-generation light sources delivering many-fold increases in
coherent flux. The need for real-time feedback under accelerated acquisition
rates motivates surrogate reconstruction models like deep neural networks,
which offer orders-of-magnitude speedup over conventional methods. However,
existing deep learning approaches lack robustness across diverse experimental
conditions. We propose an unsupervised training workflow emphasizing probe
learning by combining experimentally-measured probes with synthetic,
procedurally generated objects. This probe-centric approach enables a single
physics-informed neural network to reconstruct unseen experiments across
multiple beamlines; among the first demonstrations of multi-probe
generalization. We find probe learning is equally important as in-distribution
learning; models trained using this synthetic workflow achieve reconstruction
fidelity comparable to those trained exclusively on experimental data, even
when changing the type of synthetic training object. The proposed approach
enables training of experiment-steering models that provide real-time feedback
under dynamic experimental conditions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统强化学习中的朴素熵正则化方法在大推理模型（LRM）中失效，因为巨大的动作空间和长轨迹会导致全局熵爆炸，需要限制探索到有意义的动作和状态子集。

Method: SIREN方法采用两步熵掩码机制（top-p掩码和峰值熵掩码），将正则化转换为自锚定形式以稳定训练，将探索限制在有意义的动作和状态子集内。

Result: 在五个数学基准测试中，SIREN在熵相关的RLVR方法中取得最优平均性能，在AIME24/25上使用Qwen2.5-Math-7B实现了+6.6 maj@k的提升，促进了更大的响应多样性并保持适当的熵水平。

Conclusion: SIREN有效缓解了LRM中RLVR常见的过早收敛问题，通过选择性熵正则化维持了验证pass@k在整个训练过程中的稳定性。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has shown great promise
in enhancing the reasoning abilities of large reasoning models (LRMs). However,
it suffers from a critical issue: entropy collapse and premature convergence.
Naive entropy regularization, a common approach for encouraging exploration in
the traditional RL literature, fails to address this problem in the context of
LRM. Our analysis reveals that this failure stems from the vast action space
and long trajectories in LRMs, which easily trigger a global entropy explosion
as the model indiscriminately explores all possible actions and states. To
address this, we propose SIREN (SelectIve entRopy rEgularizatioN), a method
that confines exploration to a meaningful subset of actions and states. SIREN
achieves this through a two-step entropy masking mechanism, consisting of a
top-p mask and a peak-entropy mask. In addition, regularization is transformed
into a self-anchored form to stabilize training. Across five mathematical
benchmarks, SIREN attains superior average performance over previous
entropy-related RLVR approaches, exemplified by a +6.6 maj@k improvement on
AIME24/25 with Qwen2.5-Math-7B. Further analysis confirms that SIREN promotes
greater response diversity and maintains entropy at an appropriate level, which
helps to preserve the validation pass@k throughout training. This effectively
mitigates the premature convergence problem common in RLVR for LRM.

Conclusion: 重放设置比传统错误边界设置更困难，某些类具有常数Littlestone维度但任意大的扩展阈值维度。适当学习表现出更尖锐的分离：类在重放下可适当学习当且仅当它（几乎）是交集闭的。

Abstract: As machine learning systems increasingly train on self-annotated data, they
risk reinforcing errors and becoming echo chambers of their own beliefs. We
model this phenomenon by introducing a learning-theoretic framework: Online
Learning in the Replay Setting. In round $t$, the learner outputs a hypothesis
$\hat{h}_t$; the adversary then reveals either the true label $f^\ast(x_t)$ or
a replayed label $\hat{h}_i(x_t)$ from an earlier round $i < t$. A mistake is
counted only when the true label is shown, yet classical algorithms such as the
SOA or the halving algorithm are easily misled by the replayed errors.
  We introduce the Extended Threshold dimension, $\mathrm{ExThD}(\mathcal{H})$,
and prove matching upper and lower bounds that make
$\mathrm{ExThD}(\mathcal{H})$ the exact measure of learnability in this model.
A closure-based learner makes at most $\mathrm{ExThD}(\mathcal{H})$ mistakes
against any adaptive adversary, and no algorithm can perform better. For
stochastic adversaries, we prove a similar bound for every intersection-closed
class. The replay setting is provably harder than the classical mistake bound
setting: some classes have constant Littlestone dimension but arbitrarily large
$\mathrm{ExThD}(\mathcal{H})$. Proper learning exhibits an even sharper
separation: a class is properly learnable under replay if and only if it is
(almost) intersection-closed. Otherwise, every proper learner suffers
$\Omega(T)$ errors, whereas our improper algorithm still achieves the
$\mathrm{ExThD}(\mathcal{H})$ bound. These results give the first tight
analysis of learning against replay adversaries, based on new results for
closure-type algorithms.

TL;DR: BALF是一个无需微调的神经网络压缩框架，通过激活感知分解和可扩展的预算秩分配器，在多种模型上实现高效压缩。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统神经网络压缩方法需要昂贵的微调或搜索过程，在普通硬件上不实用，需要开发无需微调的压缩方案。

Method: 提出激活感知分解框架和可扩展预算秩分配器，形成BALF压缩流水线，无需微调即可控制压缩目标。

Result: 在ResNet-20、ResNeXt-101和视觉变换器等多种模型上验证，ResNeXt-101的FLOPs减少45%时仅损失1%的top-1准确率。

Conclusion: BALF提供了一种无需微调的高效压缩方案，在保持良好性能的同时显著减少计算开销。

Abstract: Neural network compression techniques typically require expensive fine-tuning
or search procedures, rendering them impractical on commodity hardware.
Inspired by recent LLM compression research, we present a general
activation-aware factorization framework that can be applied to a broad range
of layers. Moreover, we introduce a scalable budgeted rank allocator that
allows flexible control over compression targets (e.g., retaining 50% of
parameters) with no overhead. Together, these components form BALF, an
efficient pipeline for compressing models without fine-tuning. We demonstrate
its effectiveness across multiple scales and architectures, from ResNet-20 on
CIFAR-10 to ResNeXt-101 and vision transformers on ImageNet, and show that it
achieves excellent results in the fine-tuning-free regime. For instance, BALF
reduces FLOPs on ResNeXt-101 by 45% with only a 1-percentage-point top-1
accuracy drop.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究注意力机制如何学习选择性地关注信息丰富的token，从而检测弱、稀疏且稀疏分布的特征，特别是在长序列中理解注意力相对于线性分类器的优势。

Method: 使用稀疏token分类模型，其中正样本在随机选择的token子集中嵌入弱信号向量，负样本是纯噪声。在长序列极限和高维机制下分析单层注意力分类器的理论性能。

Result: 注意力分类器在信号强度仅需对数增长时就能实现消失的测试误差，而线性分类器需要平方根增长。仅两次梯度更新就能使注意力权重与隐藏信号对齐。

Conclusion: 注意力机制通过自适应token选择在检测弱稀疏特征方面优于非自适应线性基线，解释了其容量优势。

Abstract: When and how can an attention mechanism learn to selectively attend to
informative tokens, thereby enabling detection of weak, rare, and sparsely
located features? We address these questions theoretically in a sparse-token
classification model in which positive samples embed a weak signal vector in a
randomly chosen subset of tokens, whereas negative samples are pure noise. In
the long-sequence limit, we show that a simple single-layer attention
classifier can in principle achieve vanishing test error when the signal
strength grows only logarithmically in the sequence length $L$, whereas linear
classifiers require $\sqrt{L}$ scaling. Moving from representational power to
learnability, we study training at finite $L$ in a high-dimensional regime,
where sample size and embedding dimension grow proportionally. We prove that
just two gradient updates suffice for the query weight vector of the attention
classifier to acquire a nontrivial alignment with the hidden signal, inducing
an attention map that selectively amplifies informative tokens. We further
derive an exact asymptotic expression for the test error and training loss of
the trained attention-based classifier, and quantify its capacity -- the
largest dataset size that is typically perfectly separable -- thereby
explaining the advantage of adaptive token selection over nonadaptive linear
baselines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成模型在合成复杂数据分布的高保真样本方面表现出色，但经常违反物理定律或任务规范产生的硬约束。现有投影方法会扭曲学习分布，而多阶段方法会增加算法复杂度和累积误差。

Method: CCFM方法将随机优化集成到采样过程中，直接在噪声中间样本上操作，但理论上等同于在干净样本上投影到可行集，从而减轻分布扭曲。

Result: 实验表明CCFM在建模由偏微分方程控制的复杂物理系统和分子对接问题时，在可行性和保真度方面均优于当前最先进的约束生成模型。

Conclusion: CCFM提供了一种训练自由的方法，能够有效强制执行硬约束，同时保持高保真度样本生成，在复杂约束场景下表现优异。

Abstract: Generative models excel at synthesizing high-fidelity samples from complex
data distributions, but they often violate hard constraints arising from
physical laws or task specifications. A common remedy is to project
intermediate samples onto the feasible set; however, repeated projection can
distort the learned distribution and induce a mismatch with the data manifold.
Thus, recent multi-stage procedures attempt to defer projection to clean
samples during sampling, but they increase algorithmic complexity and
accumulate errors across steps. This paper addresses these challenges by
proposing a novel training-free method, Chance-constrained Flow Matching
(CCFM), that integrates stochastic optimization into the sampling process,
enabling effective enforcement of hard constraints while maintaining
high-fidelity sample generation. Importantly, CCFM guarantees feasibility in
the same manner as conventional repeated projection, yet, despite operating
directly on noisy intermediate samples, it is theoretically equivalent to
projecting onto the feasible set defined by clean samples. This yields a
sampler that mitigates distributional distortion. Empirical experiments show
that CCFM outperforms current state-of-the-art constrained generative models in
modeling complex physical systems governed by partial differential equations
and molecular docking problems, delivering higher feasibility and fidelity.

Conclusion: 物理信息归纳偏置能显著提升图神经网络在配电网电压预测中的泛化能力和可靠性

Abstract: Voltage prediction in distribution grids is a critical yet difficult task for
maintaining power system stability. Machine learning approaches, particularly
Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), offer significant speedups but suffer from poor
generalization when trained on limited or incomplete data. In this work, we
systematically investigate the role of inductive biases in improving a model's
ability to reliably learn power flow. Specifically, we evaluate three
physics-informed strategies: (i) power-flow-constrained loss functions, (ii)
complex-valued neural networks, and (iii) residual-based task reformulation.
Using the ENGAGE dataset, which spans multiple low- and medium-voltage grid
configurations, we conduct controlled experiments to isolate the effect of each
inductive bias and assess both standard predictive performance and
out-of-distribution generalization. Our study provides practical insights into
which model assumptions most effectively guide learning for reliable and
efficient voltage prediction in modern distribution networks.

TL;DR: GLASS Flows是一种新的采样范式，通过模拟"流匹配模型中的流匹配模型"来采样马尔可夫转移，将ODE的效率与SDE的随机演化相结合，无需重新训练即可从预训练模型中获取。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有奖励对齐算法在推理时依赖SDE采样，效率低下且性能较差，需要一种能结合ODE效率和SDE随机演化的解决方案。

Method: 提出GLASS Flows采样范式，通过模拟内部流匹配模型来采样马尔可夫转移，可从预训练模型中直接获取而无需重新训练。

Result: 在大规模文生图模型中，GLASS Flows消除了随机演化与效率之间的权衡，结合Feynman-Kac Steering提升了最先进的文生图性能。

Conclusion: GLASS Flows为流和扩散模型的推理时扩展提供了一个简单、即插即用的解决方案。

Abstract: The performance of flow matching and diffusion models can be greatly improved
at inference time using reward alignment algorithms, yet efficiency remains a
major limitation. While several algorithms were proposed, we demonstrate that a
common bottleneck is the sampling method these algorithms rely on: many
algorithms require to sample Markov transitions via SDE sampling, which is
significantly less efficient and often less performant than ODE sampling. To
remove this bottleneck, we introduce GLASS Flows, a new sampling paradigm that
simulates a "flow matching model within a flow matching model" to sample Markov
transitions. As we show in this work, this "inner" flow matching model can be
retrieved from a pre-trained model without any re-training, combining the
efficiency of ODEs with the stochastic evolution of SDEs. On large-scale
text-to-image models, we show that GLASS Flows eliminate the trade-off between
stochastic evolution and efficiency. Combined with Feynman-Kac Steering, GLASS
Flows improve state-of-the-art performance in text-to-image generation, making
it a simple, drop-in solution for inference-time scaling of flow and diffusion
models.

Result: 在生物序列扩散模型的单目标和多目标微调中验证了框架的有效性。

Conclusion: TR2-D2为离散序列生成中的奖励引导微调提供了可靠解决方案。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with stochastic optimal control offers a promising
framework for diffusion fine-tuning, where a pre-trained diffusion model is
optimized to generate paths that lead to a reward-tilted distribution. While
these approaches enable optimization without access to explicit samples from
the optimal distribution, they require training on rollouts under the current
fine-tuned model, making them susceptible to reinforcing sub-optimal
trajectories that yield poor rewards. To overcome this challenge, we introduce
TRee Search Guided TRajectory-Aware Fine-Tuning for Discrete Diffusion
(TR2-D2), a novel framework that optimizes reward-guided discrete diffusion
trajectories with tree search to construct replay buffers for trajectory-aware
fine-tuning. These buffers are generated using Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)
and subsequently used to fine-tune a pre-trained discrete diffusion model under
a stochastic optimal control objective. We validate our framework on single-
and multi-objective fine-tuning of biological sequence diffusion models,
highlighting the overall effectiveness of TR2-D2 for reliable reward-guided
fine-tuning in discrete sequence generation.

Abstract: Sample efficiency is a central property of effective deep reinforcement
learning algorithms. Recent work has improved this through added complexity,
such as larger models, exotic network architectures, and more complex
algorithms, which are typically motivated purely by empirical performance. We
take a more principled approach by focusing on the optimization landscape of
the critic network. Using the eigenspectrum and condition number of the
critic's Hessian, we systematically investigate the impact of common
architectural design decisions on training dynamics. Our analysis reveals that
a novel combination of batch normalization (BN), weight normalization (WN), and
a distributional cross-entropy (CE) loss produces condition numbers orders of
magnitude smaller than baselines. This combination also naturally bounds
gradient norms, a property critical for maintaining a stable effective learning
rate under non-stationary targets and bootstrapping. Based on these insights,
we introduce XQC: a well-motivated, sample-efficient deep actor-critic
algorithm built upon soft actor-critic that embodies these optimization-aware
principles. We achieve state-of-the-art sample efficiency across 55
proprioception and 15 vision-based continuous control tasks, all while using
significantly fewer parameters than competing methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大型推理模型存在重复思考模式，减少这些重复往往以性能下降为代价，需要克服这种权衡。

Method: 采用迭代训练机制，在压缩阶段限制推理长度迫使模型做出精确决策，在扩展阶段放宽长度限制让模型探索长视野推理，通过动态调整最大推理长度实现交替训练。

Result: 在DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B上训练，SIRI-low在AIME24上性能提升43.2%同时减少46.9%的token使用，SIRI-high达到最高准确率。

Conclusion: 通过在训练期间周期性调整推理模型的输出截断长度，可以动态平衡探索与效率，收敛到两者之间的最优平衡点。

Abstract: We introduce SIRI, Scaling Iterative Reinforcement Learning with Interleaved
Compression, a simple yet effective RL approach for Large Reasoning Models
(LRMs) that enables more efficient and accurate reasoning. Existing studies
have observed repetitive thinking patterns in LRMs, and attempts to reduce them
often come at the cost of performance. In this paper, we show that this
trade-off can be overcome through a training regime that iteratively alternates
between compressing and expanding the reasoning budget, by dynamically
adjusting the maximum rollout length during training. The compression phase
cuts the rollout length, forcing the model to make precise and valuable
decisions within a limited context, which effectively reduces redundant tokens
and increases reasoning density. The expansion phase then relaxes the length
limit, providing space for the model to explore and plan in long-horizon
settings. Remarkably, we find that after each compression-expansion cycle, the
model's performance improves even as its output length decreases, steadily
pushing it closer to the Pareto frontier in the performance-efficiency
trade-off. Training on DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B, SIRI-low improves
performance on AIME24 by 43.2% while reducing token usage by 46.9% after three
iterations, and SIRI-high achieves the highest accuracy compared to all other
methods (Figure 1). Our findings shed light on the potential of periodically
oscillating the LRM's output truncation length during training to dynamically
balance exploration and efficiency in reasoning, converging towards an optimal
"sweet spot" between the two. Our models are publicly available.

Abstract: AI training creates synchronized, step-dominant surges with millisecond edges
that destabilize constant-power loads (Choukse et al., 2025; arXiv:2508.14318).
We propose a physics-anchored row-scale $\pm 400$ Vdc architecture that makes
Computational Continuity a structural property. DRUs supply fast energy via
controlled droop; SSTs regulate average power with bounded ramps and no reverse
power flow and no high-frequency export at the PCC; import is subjected to a
bounded dP/dt envelope; film capacitance and clamps absorb the first edge. The
contract is explicit: $\pm 1\%$ steady-band, $\leq 2\%$ transient deviation,
$\leq 3$ ms recovery, $\geq 45^{\circ}$ margin, reserve floors intact, yields
spine and lowest branches. Recharge is valley-following (admitted only below
Avg with MW headroom; $\leq 5$ kW/s per row ramps). Protection is time-graded
(branch $\mu$s, row ms, MW seconds). Scaling preserves invariants from row to
pod/hall/campus without retuning. Conformance is by waveform evidence
(microsecond branch clears, $2\%/50$ ms holds, FLISR with no reverse power flow
and no high-frequency export at the PCC). The result is not tuning but a
contract for continuity.

Conclusion: 这些特性结合低功耗和小变异性，可能为在电光硬件中实现复杂生物学习过程的节能高效实现铺平道路。

Abstract: Modern computers perform pre-defined operations using static memory
components, whereas biological systems learn through inherently dynamic,
time-dependent processes in synapses and neurons. The biological learning
process also relies on global signals - neuromodulators - who influence many
synapses at once depending on their dynamic, internal state. In this study,
using optical radiation as a global neuromodulatory signal, we investigate
nanoscale SrTiO3 (STO) memristors that can act as solid-state synapses. Via
diverse sets of measurements, we demonstrate that the memristor's photoresponse
depends on the electrical conductance state, following a well-defined square
root relation. Additionally, we show that the conductance decays after
photoexcitation with time constants in the range of 1 - 10 s and that this
effect can be reliably controlled using an electrical bias. These properties in
combination with our device's low power operation (< 1pJ per optical pulse) and
small measurement variability may pave the way for space- and energy-efficient
implementations of complex biological learning processes in electro-optical
hardware.

Abstract: In the realm of programmable photonic integrated circuits (PICs), precise
wire length control is crucial for the performance of on-chip programmable
components such as optical ring resonators, Mach-Zehnder interferometers, and
optical true time-delay lines. Unlike conventional routing algorithms that
prioritize shortest-path solutions, these photonic components require
exact-length routing to maintain the desired optical properties.
  To address these challenges, this paper presents different length-matching
routing strategies to find exact-length paths while balancing search space and
runtime efficiently. We propose a novel admissible heuristic estimator and a
pruning method, designed to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of the search
process. The algorithms are derived from the Best-First search with modified
evaluation functions. For two-pin length-matching routing, we formally prove
that the proposed algorithms are complete under monotonic heuristics. For
multi-pin length-matching challenges, we introduce a pin-ordering mechanism
based on detour margins to reduce the likelihood of prematurely blocking
feasible routes. Through evaluations on various length-matching benchmarks, we
analyze runtime and heuristic performance, demonstrating the effectiveness of
the proposed approaches across different layout scenarios.

Result: BP在控制流密集、内存访问模式不规则的任务中表现优异，而BS在AI中常见的大规模并行、低精度（如INT4/INT8）计算方面具有显著优势。

Conclusion: 挑战了PIM数据布局的"一刀切"观点，为设计下一代工作负载感知和潜在混合PIM系统提供了原则性基础，并提炼出一套可操作的设计指南。

Abstract: Processing-in-Memory (PIM) is a promising approach to overcoming the
memory-wall bottleneck. However, the PIM community has largely treated its two
fundamental data layouts, Bit-Parallel (BP) and Bit-Serial (BS), as if they
were interchangeable. This implicit "one-layout-fits-all" assumption, often
hard-coded into existing evaluation frameworks, creates a critical gap:
architects lack systematic, workload-driven guidelines for choosing the optimal
data layout for their target applications.
  To address this gap, this paper presents the first systematic,
workload-driven characterization of BP and BS PIM architectures. We develop
iso-area, cycle-accurate BP and BS PIM architectural models and conduct a
comprehensive evaluation using a diverse set of benchmarks. Our suite includes
both fine-grained microworkloads from MIMDRAM to isolate specific operational
characteristics, and large-scale applications from the PIMBench suite, such as
the VGG network, to represent realistic end-to-end workloads.
  Our results quantitatively demonstrate that no single layout is universally
superior; the optimal choice is strongly dependent on workload characteristics.
BP excels on control-flow-intensive tasks with irregular memory access
patterns, whereas BS shows substantial advantages in massively parallel,
low-precision (e.g., INT4/INT8) computations common in AI. Based on this
characterization, we distill a set of actionable design guidelines for
architects. This work challenges the prevailing one-size-fits-all view on PIM
data layouts and provides a principled foundation for designing
next-generation, workload-aware, and potentially hybrid PIM systems.

Main category: cs.AR

TL;DR: 提出了精度增强的混合时序计算框架E-HTC，通过EMBA精确二进制累加器和DTSA确定性阈值缩放加法器，在保持低功耗的同时显著提高了计算精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的HTC架构虽然通过脉冲率和时序数据编码降低了功耗，但基于MUX的缩放加法导致精度损失，需要改进加法方案来平衡精度和功耗。

Method: 提出两种位流加法方案：EMBA（精确多输入二进制累加器）和DTSA（确定性阈值缩放加法器），集成到支持单极和双极编码的MAC单元中。

Result: 在4x4 MAC中，单极模式下E-HTC与CBSC的RMSE相当，比MUX-HTC精度提高94%，功耗和面积分别减少23%和7%；双极模式下RMSE为2.09%，比MUX-HTC提高83%。在FIR和DCT/iDCT应用中均获得显著精度提升和功耗节省。

Conclusion: E-HTC框架成功实现了精度和功耗的良好平衡，在保持超低功耗特性的同时显著提高了计算精度，为硬件加速器提供了更优的设计方案。

Abstract: This paper presents an accuracy-enhanced Hybrid Temporal Computing (E-HTC)
framework for ultra-low-power hardware accelerators with deterministic
additions. Inspired by the recently proposed HTC architecture, which leverages
pulse-rate and temporal data encoding to reduce switching activity and energy
consumption but loses accuracy due to its multiplexer (MUX)-based scaled
addition, we propose two bitstream addition schemes: (1) an Exact
Multiple-input Binary Accumulator (EMBA), which performs precise binary
accumulation, and (2) a Deterministic Threshold-based Scaled Adder (DTSA),
which employs threshold logic for scaled addition. These adders are integrated
into a multiplier accumulator (MAC) unit supporting both unipolar and bipolar
encodings. To validate the framework, we implement two accelerators: a Finite
Impulse Response (FIR) filter and an 8-point Discrete Cosine Transform
(DCT)/iDCT engine. Results on a 4x4 MAC show that, in unipolar mode, E-HTC
matches the RMSE of state-of-the-art Counter-Based Stochastic Computing (CBSC)
MAC, improves accuracy by 94% over MUX-based HTC, and reduces power and area by
23% and 7% compared to MUX-based HTC and 64% and 74% compared to CBSC. In
bipolar mode, E-HTC MAC achieves 2.09% RMSE -- an 83% improvement over
MUX-based HTC -- and approaches CBSC's 1.40% RMSE with area and power savings
of 28% and 43% vs. MUX-based HTC and about 76% vs. CBSC. In FIR experiments,
both E-HTC variants yield PSNR gains of 3--5 dB (30--45% RMSE reduction) while
saving 13% power and 3% area. For DCT/iDCT, E-HTC boosts PSNR by 10--13 dB
(70--75% RMSE reduction) while saving area and power over both MUX- and
CBSC-based designs.

Main category: cs.AR

TL;DR: 提出一种名为Crypto-Near-Cache (CNC)的近缓存切片计算范式，通过将具有位线计算能力的SRAM阵列放置在缓存切片附近，来加速后量子密码算法和其他应用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 后量子密码算法的公钥和签名长度比前量子密码长3-9倍，导致显著的性能和能效开销。关键瓶颈是缓存带宽限制，这促使采用片上近缓存计算范式。

Method: 设计CNC范式，将具有位线计算能力的SRAM阵列放置在缓存切片附近，实现高内部带宽和短数据移动，支持虚拟地址寻址，并提出ISA扩展。

Result: 通过CNC实现了高内部带宽和短数据移动，原生支持虚拟寻址，为核心/缓存数据路径提供了详细实现方案。

Conclusion: CNC范式能够无缝集成到现有系统中，解决后量子密码算法的性能和能效问题，为加速此类算法提供了创新解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advancements in post-quantum cryptographic algorithms have led to
their standardization by the National Institute of Standards and Technology
(NIST) to safeguard information security in the post-quantum era. These
algorithms, however, employ public keys and signatures that are 3 to 9$\times$
longer than those used in pre-quantum cryptography, resulting in significant
performance and energy efficiency overheads. A critical bottleneck identified
in our analysis is the cache bandwidth. This limitation motivates the adoption
of on-chip in-/near-cache computing, a computing paradigm that offers
high-performance, exceptional energy efficiency, and flexibility to accelerate
post-quantum cryptographic algorithms. Our analysis of existing works reveals
challenges in integrating in-/near-cache computing into modern computer systems
and performance limitations due to external bandwidth limitation, highlighting
the need for innovative solutions that can seamlessly integrate into existing
systems without performance and energy efficiency issues. In this paper, we
introduce a near-cache-slice computing paradigm with support of customization
and virtual address, named Crypto-Near-Cache (CNC), designed to accelerate
post-quantum cryptographic algorithms and other applications. By placing SRAM
arrays with bitline computing capability near cache slices, high internal
bandwidth and short data movement are achieved with native support of virtual
addressing. An ISA extension to facilitate CNC is also proposed, with detailed
discussion on the implementation aspects of the core/cache datapath.

TL;DR: AssertGen是一个基于LLM的断言生成框架，通过链式思维推理从规范中提取验证目标，构建跨层信号链，生成SystemVerilog断言，在多个指标上优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于LLM的断言生成方法无法有效识别设计规范与RTL设计之间的关系，导致生成的断言不足。

Method: 首先使用链式思维推理从规范中提取验证目标，然后在目标与RTL代码之间桥接信号构建跨层信号链，最后基于LLM生成SystemVerilog断言。

Result: 实验结果显示AssertGen在形式属性验证通过率、影响锥、证明核心和变异测试覆盖率等关键指标上优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: AssertGen通过有效连接规范与RTL设计，显著提升了断言生成的质量和效果。

Abstract: Assertion-based verification (ABV) serves as a crucial technique for ensuring
that register-transfer level (RTL) designs adhere to their specifications.
While Large Language Model (LLM) aided assertion generation approaches have
recently achieved remarkable progress, existing methods are still unable to
effectively identify the relationship between design specifications and RTL
designs, which leads to the insufficiency of the generated assertions. To
address this issue, we propose AssertGen, an assertion generation framework
that automatically generates SystemVerilog assertions (SVA). AssertGen first
extracts verification objectives from specifications using a chain-of-thought
(CoT) reasoning strategy, then bridges corresponding signals between these
objectives and the RTL code to construct a cross-layer signal chain, and
finally generates SVAs based on the LLM. Experimental results demonstrate that
AssertGen outperforms the existing state-of-the-art methods across several key
metrics, such as pass rate of formal property verification (FPV), cone of
influence (COI), proof core and mutation testing coverage.

TL;DR: 本文探讨了硬件压缩解压处理单元(CDPU)在数据中心中的优化设计、算法选择和系统级部署问题，通过比较三种CDPU部署方式(外设、片上、存储内)的性能表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CPU执行无损压缩在数据中心带来显著计算开销，硬件CDPU可以缓解此问题，但最优算法选择、微架构设计和系统级部署仍不明确。

Method: 设计ASIC存储内CDPU，并与Intel QAT 8970和QAT 4xxx进行端到端评估，涵盖三种CDPU部署方式：外设、片上、存储内。

Result: 发现：(i)吞吐量和延迟对CDPU部署和互连高度敏感；(ii)压缩效率与数据模式/布局强相关；(iii)微基准测试增益与实际应用加速存在部署驱动差异；(iv)模块级与系统级能效存在差异；(v)各种CDPU的可扩展性和多租户干扰问题。

Conclusion: 这些发现促使对超大规模存储基础设施中的硬件压缩解压进行部署感知的跨层重新思考。

Abstract: Lossless compression imposes significant computational over head on
datacenters when performed on CPUs. Hardware compression and decompression
processing units (CDPUs) can alleviate this overhead, but optimal algorithm
selection, microarchitectural design, and system-level placement of CDPUs are
still not well understood. We present the design of an ASIC-based in-storage
CDPU and provide a comprehensive end-to-end evaluation against two leading ASIC
accelerators, Intel QAT 8970 and QAT 4xxx. The evaluation spans three dominant
CDPU placement regimes: peripheral, on-chip, and in-storage. Our results
reveal: (i) acute sensitivity of throughput and latency to CDPU placement and
interconnection, (ii) strong correlation between compression efficiency and
data patterns/layouts, (iii) placement-driven divergences between
microbenchmark gains and real-application speedups, (iv) discrepancies between
module and system-level power efficiency, and (v) scalability and multi-tenant
interference is sues of various CDPUs. These findings motivate a
placement-aware, cross-layer rethinking of hardware (de)compression for
hyperscale storage infrastructures.

Main category: cs.AR

TL;DR: 提出了AssertFix框架，基于大语言模型自动修复SystemVerilog断言中的错误，通过定位RTL代码、识别错误根源、分类错误类型并应用专用修复策略来提高断言质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 手动编写和维护SystemVerilog断言具有挑战性且容易出错，现有基于LLM的断言生成方法将错误修复负担留给人工，限制了这些方法的应用。

Method: 提出AssertFix框架，自动定位与错误断言相关的RTL代码，系统识别断言错误的根本原因，分类错误类型，并应用专用修复策略自动纠正错误。

Result: 在Opencore基准测试中，AssertFix在修复率和验证覆盖率方面都取得了显著提升。

Conclusion: AssertFix框架能够有效提高自动生成的SystemVerilog断言的质量，解决了现有方法中错误修复依赖人工的问题。

Abstract: Assertion-based verification (ABV) is critical in ensuring that
register-transfer level (RTL) designs conform to their functional
specifications. SystemVerilog Assertions (SVA) effectively specify design
properties, but writing and maintaining them manually is challenging and
error-prone. Although recent progress of assertion generation methods
leveraging large language models (LLMs) have shown great potential in improving
assertion quality, they typically treat assertion generation as a final step,
leaving the burden of fixing of the incorrect assertions to human effects,
which may significantly limits the application of these methods. To address the
above limitation, we propose an automatic assertion fix framework based on
LLMs, named AssertFix. AsserFix accurately locates the RTL code related to the
incorrect assertion, systematically identifies the root causes of the assertion
errors, classifies the error type and finally applies dedicated fix strategies
to automatically correct these errors, improving the overall quality of the
generated assertions. Experimental results show that AssertFix achieves
noticeable improvements in both fix rate and verification coverage across the
Opencore benchmarks.

Motivation: 随着SoC架构复杂性增加，片上通信结构（特别是总线）的漏洞日益突出，总线作为IP核间互连可能成为故障攻击的潜在载体。

Method: 采用仿真驱动的故障注入方法，系统性地检查故障成功率、空间漏洞分布和时间依赖性，以表征故障与总线级事务的交互方式。

Result: 研究结果揭示了跨协议的一致行为模式，为攻击建模和弹性SoC设计提供了实用见解。

Conclusion: 总线协议在故障注入攻击下存在系统性漏洞，研究结果有助于改进SoC的安全性和韧性设计。

Abstract: Fault injection attacks exploit physical disturbances to compromise the
functionality and security of integrated circuits. As System on Chip (SoC)
architectures grow in complexity, the vulnerability of on chip communication
fabrics has become increasingly prominent. Buses, serving as interconnects
among various IP cores, represent potential vectors for fault-based
exploitation. In this study, we perform simulation-driven fault injection
across three mainstream bus protocols Wishbone, AXI Lite, and AXI. We
systematically examine fault success rates, spatial vulnerability
distributions, and timing dependencies to characterize how faults interact with
bus-level transactions. The results uncover consistent behavioral patterns
across protocols, offering practical insights for both attack modeling and the
development of resilient SoC designs.

TL;DR: QMoE模型专注于压缩大规模混合专家模型，但未考虑移动设备等受限环境的内存和延迟限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大规模MoE模型在内存受限的移动设备上的部署问题，消除网络延迟并支持离线使用。

Method: 未明确说明具体方法，但指出QMoE仅针对服务器环境，需要针对移动设备的优化方案。

Result: 指出当前QMoE方法在移动设备部署方面的局限性，包括内存限制、延迟问题和网络依赖。

Conclusion: 需要开发专门针对移动设备等受限环境的MoE模型压缩和部署方案。

Abstract: The QMoE model provides a practical approach for compression of massive
Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models. QMoE offers a solution geared towards memory
limitations that often reach terabyte scales, and it has the advantage of
working with high sparsity models which implicitly lend themselves to
compression techniques. QMoE also has the advantage of only taking MoE models
into account and does not evaluate its use with non mixture of expert systems.
Although this prior attempt focuses on the limitations of large servers with
the latest NVIDIA hardware which in the case of the H100 and V100 which have 80
GB of HBM (High Bandwidth Memory), what is not being considered is a
significantly more constrained environment, such as in the case of mobile
devices which may have in the case of the iPhone anywhere from 4 to 8 GB of
unified memory which also needs to be shared with the operating system and
additional processes. Although edge devices such as phones and laptops are
becoming increasingly more computationally powerful, they are still not close
to the level of advanced server machines such as NVIDIA. An additional
constraint that we must consider is that of latency. The communication time of
sending a request to an LLM server and then getting it back is an additional
waiting time that can be removed. We may also want to use LLM technology in
environments where there is no reliable network connection.

Abstract: This work introduces a new subarea of performance tuning -- performance
tuning in a shared interference-prone computing environment. We demonstrate
that existing tuners are significantly suboptimal by design because of their
inability to account for interference during tuning. Our solution, DarwinGame,
employs a tournament-based design to systematically compare application
executions with different tunable parameter configurations, enabling it to
identify the relative performance of different tunable parameter configurations
in a noisy environment. Compared to existing solutions, DarwinGame achieves
more than 27% reduction in execution time, with less than 0.5% performance
variability. DarwinGame is the first performance tuner that will help
developers tune their applications in shared, interference-prone, cloud
environments.
