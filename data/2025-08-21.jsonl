To overcome these obstacles,\ninnovative approaches are required. Agile chip design has already benefited\nfrom machine learning integration at various stages, including logic synthesis,\nplacement, and routing. With Large Language Models (LLMs) recently\ndemonstrating impressive proficiency in Hardware Description Language (HDL)\ngeneration, it is promising to extend their abilities to 2.5D integration, an\nadvanced technique that saves area overhead and development costs. However,\nLLM-driven chiplet design faces challenges such as flatten design, high\nvalidation cost and imprecise parameter optimization, which limit its chiplet\ndesign capability. To address this, we propose MAHL, a hierarchical LLM-based\nchiplet design generation framework that features six agents which\ncollaboratively enable AI algorithm-hardware mapping, including hierarchical\ndescription generation, retrieval-augmented code generation, diverseflow-based\nvalidation, and multi-granularity design space exploration. These components\ntogether enhance the efficient generation of chiplet design with optimized\nPower, Performance and Area (PPA). Experiments show that MAHL not only\nsignificantly improves the generation accuracy of simple RTL design, but also\nincreases the generation accuracy of real-world chiplet design, evaluated by\nPass@5, from 0 to 0.72 compared to conventional LLMs under the best-case\nscenario. Compared to state-of-the-art CLARIE (expert-based), MAHL achieves\ncomparable or even superior PPA results under certain optimization objectives."}

Despite its operational and environmental\nbenefits, limited research has systematically examined the factors influencing\nCDO performance. Moreover, many existing methods in related areas, such as\ntrajectory optimization, lack the transparency required in aviation, where\nexplainability is critical for safety and stakeholder trust. This study\naddresses these gaps by proposing a Fuzzy-Enhanced Explainable AI (FEXAI)\nframework that integrates fuzzy logic with machine learning and SHapley\nAdditive exPlanations (SHAP) analysis. For this purpose, a comprehensive\ndataset of 29 features, including 11 operational and 18 weather-related\nfeatures, was collected from 1,094 flights using Automatic Dependent\nSurveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B) data. Machine learning models and SHAP were then\napplied to classify flights' CDO adherence levels and rank features by\nimportance. The three most influential features, as identified by SHAP scores,\nwere then used to construct a fuzzy rule-based classifier, enabling the\nextraction of interpretable fuzzy rules. All models achieved classification\naccuracies above 90%, with FEXAI providing meaningful, human-readable rules for\noperational users. Results indicated that the average descent rate within the\narrival route, the number of descent segments, and the average change in\ndirectional heading during descent were the strongest predictors of CDO\nperformance. The FEXAI method proposed in this study presents a novel pathway\nfor operational decision support and could be integrated into aviation tools to\nenable real-time advisories that maintain CDO adherence under varying\noperational conditions."}

We present a novel multimodal\nQuantum Machine Learning (QML) framework that enhances Enzyme Commission (EC)\nclassification by integrating four complementary biochemical modalities:\nprotein sequence embeddings, quantum-derived electronic descriptors, molecular\ngraph structures, and 2D molecular image representations. Quantum Vision\nTransformer (QVT) backbone equipped with modality-specific encoders and a\nunified cross-attention fusion module. By integrating graph features and\nspatial patterns, our method captures key stereoelectronic interactions behind\nenzyme function.

Despite the overall success of alignment techniques such as\nreinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) on typical prompts, LLMs\nremain vulnerable to jailbreak attacks enabled by crafted adversarial triggers\nappended to user prompts. Most existing jailbreak methods either rely on\ninefficient searches over discrete token spaces or direct optimization of\ncontinuous embeddings. While continuous embeddings can be given directly to\nselected open-source models as input, doing so is not feasible for proprietary\nmodels. On the other hand, projecting these embeddings back into valid discrete\ntokens introduces additional complexity and often reduces attack effectiveness.\nWe propose an intrinsic optimization method which directly optimizes relaxed\none-hot encodings of the adversarial suffix tokens using exponentiated gradient\ndescent coupled with Bregman projection, ensuring that the optimized one-hot\nencoding of each token always remains within the probability simplex. We\nprovide theoretical proof of convergence for our proposed method and implement\nan efficient algorithm that effectively jailbreaks several widely used LLMs.\nOur method achieves higher success rates and faster convergence compared to\nthree state-of-the-art baselines, evaluated on five open-source LLMs and four\nadversarial behavior datasets curated for evaluating jailbreak methods. In\naddition to individual prompt attacks, we also generate universal adversarial\nsuffixes effective across multiple prompts and demonstrate transferability of\noptimized suffixes to different LLMs."}

Motivated by the way quantum squeezed states\nredistribute uncertainty according to the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, we\nintroduce Squeezed Diffusion Models (SDM), which scale noise anisotropically\nalong the principal component of the training distribution. As squeezing\nenhances the signal-to-noise ratio in physics, we hypothesize that scaling\nnoise in a data-dependent manner can better assist diffusion models in learning\nimportant data features. We study two configurations: (i) a Heisenberg\ndiffusion model that compensates the scaling on the principal axis with inverse\nscaling on orthogonal directions and (ii) a standard SDM variant that scales\nonly the principal axis. Counterintuitively, on CIFAR-10/100 and CelebA-64,\nmild antisqueezing - i.e. increasing variance on the principal axis -\nconsistently improves FID by up to 15% and shifts the precision-recall frontier\ntoward higher recall. Our results demonstrate that simple, data-aware noise\nshaping can deliver robust generative gains without architectural changes."}

While such scaling has been well studied for\nlanguage modeling, reinforcement learning (RL) has received less attention in\nthis regard. In this paper, we investigate compute scaling for online,\nvalue-based deep RL. These methods present two primary axes for compute\nallocation: model capacity and the update-to-data (UTD) ratio. Given a fixed\ncompute budget, we ask: how should resources be partitioned across these axes\nto maximize sample efficiency? Our analysis reveals a nuanced interplay between\nmodel size, batch size, and UTD. In particular, we identify a phenomenon we\ncall TD-overfitting: increasing the batch quickly harms Q-function accuracy for\nsmall models, but this effect is absent in large models, enabling effective use\nof large batch size at scale. We provide a mental model for understanding this\nphenomenon and build guidelines for choosing batch size and UTD to optimize\ncompute usage. Our findings provide a grounded starting point for\ncompute-optimal scaling in deep RL, mirroring studies in supervised learning\nbut adapted to TD learning."}
