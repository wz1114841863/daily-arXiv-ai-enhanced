Various innovative computing modes have been proposed, such as optical, quantum phenomena, and DNA-based modes. Sequential logic circuits are a critical factor that enables these modes to function as general-purpose computers, given their essential role in facilitating continuous computation and memory storage through their ability to store states. However, compared to computability, it is often overlooked due to the difficulty of its implementation. In this paper, we first demonstrate sequential mapping, a crucial necessary condition for electronic computers to realize sequential logic circuits, and highlight this distinctive property of general-purpose computers in the context of logic gate circuits. To achieve computational functionalities comparable to those of electronic computers, we utilize the control effect of enzymes on enzymatic reactions to design a logic gate model that is composed of small molecules and driven by enzymes, subsequently propose a biochemical computing mode. Furthermore, we mathematically analyze the static and dynamic input-output properties of biochemical logic gate components and prove that the biochemical computing mode satisfies sequential mapping similar to electronic computers. When combined with the storage characteristics of NOT-AND gates, it can realize sequential logic circuits. The findings can serve as a theoretical foundation for developing general-purpose biochemical computers.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u9176\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u5c0f\u5206\u5b50\u903b\u8f91\u95e8\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u751f\u5316\u8ba1\u7b97\u6a21\u5f0f\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u7c7b\u4f3c\u7535\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u7684\u987a\u5e8f\u6620\u5c04\uff0c\u4e3a\u5f00\u53d1\u901a\u7528\u751f\u5316\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u63d0\u4f9b\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e0b\u4e00\u4ee3\u901a\u7528\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\uff08\u5982\u5149\u5b66\u3001\u91cf\u5b50\u3001DNA\u8ba1\u7b97\uff09\u9700\u8981\u987a\u5e8f\u903b\u8f91\u7535\u8def\u6765\u5b9e\u73b0\u6301\u7eed\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u5b58\u50a8\u529f\u80fd\uff0c\u4f46\u8fd9\u4e00\u5173\u952e\u56e0\u7d20\u5e38\u56e0\u5b9e\u73b0\u56f0\u96be\u800c\u88ab\u5ffd\u89c6\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u63a2\u7d22\u751f\u5316\u8ba1\u7b97\u6a21\u5f0f\u5982\u4f55\u5b9e\u73b0\u7c7b\u4f3c\u7535\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u7684\u987a\u5e8f\u6620\u5c04\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u9176\u5bf9\u9176\u4fc3\u53cd\u5e94\u7684\u63a7\u5236\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7531\u5c0f\u5206\u5b50\u7ec4\u6210\u3001\u9176\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u903b\u8f91\u95e8\u6a21\u578b\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u6570\u5b66\u5206\u6790\u751f\u5316\u903b\u8f91\u95e8\u7ec4\u4ef6\u7684\u9759\u6001\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u8f93\u5165\u8f93\u51fa\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u8be5\u751f\u5316\u8ba1\u7b97\u6a21\u5f0f\u6ee1\u8db3\u987a\u5e8f\u6620\u5c04\u6761\u4ef6\u3002", "result": "\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u751f\u5316\u8ba1\u7b97\u6a21\u5f0f\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u7c7b\u4f3c\u7535\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u7684\u987a\u5e8f\u6620\u5c04\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408NOT-AND\u95e8\u7684\u5b58\u50a8\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5b9e\u73b0\u987a\u5e8f\u903b\u8f91\u7535\u8def\uff0c\u4e3a\u901a\u7528\u751f\u5316\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u5f00\u53d1\u5960\u5b9a\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u9176\u9a71\u52a8\u5c0f\u5206\u5b50\u903b\u8f91\u95e8\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u751f\u5316\u8ba1\u7b97\u6a21\u5f0f\u80fd\u591f\u5b9e\u73b0\u987a\u5e8f\u6620\u5c04\uff0c\u5177\u5907\u6784\u5efa\u987a\u5e8f\u903b\u8f91\u7535\u8def\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4e3a\u5f00\u53d1\u4e0b\u4e00\u4ee3\u901a\u7528\u751f\u5316\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u4f9d\u636e\u3002"}}

Mimicking this rich functional density could offer a powerful primitive for neuromorphic computing, which has sought to replace the aging digital computing paradigms using biological inspirations. Here, using electrically driven Ovonic threshold switching in Sb-Te-doped GeSe, we demonstrate a single two-terminal component capable of self-sustained dynamics and universal Boolean logic, in addition to XOR operations (which is traditionally thought to require a network of active components). We then employ logic-driven dynamics in a single component to detect and estimate the gradients of edges in images, a task that otherwise requires elaborate circuits. A network of Ovonic switches exhibits properties of a half adder and a full adder, in addition to discriminative logic accommodating inhibitory and excitatory signals. We show that this computational primitive is not only seemingly simpler, but also offers many orders of magnitude improved energy efficiency compared to prevailing digital solutions. As such, this work paves the path for potentially emulating dendrites for efficient post-digital neuromorphic computing.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5229\u7528Sb-Te\u63ba\u6742GeSe\u4e2d\u7684\u5965\u5f17\u5c3c\u514b\u9608\u503c\u5f00\u5173\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5177\u6709\u81ea\u6301\u52a8\u6001\u548c\u901a\u7528\u5e03\u5c14\u903b\u8f91\u7684\u5355\u7ec4\u4ef6\u8ba1\u7b97\u5355\u5143\uff0c\u53ef\u6267\u884cXOR\u8fd0\u7b97\u548c\u8fb9\u7f18\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u4e3a\u795e\u7ecf\u5f62\u6001\u8ba1\u7b97\u63d0\u4f9b\u9ad8\u6548\u8ba1\u7b97\u57fa\u5143\u3002", "motivation": "\u751f\u7269\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\u6811\u7a81\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u590d\u6742\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u52a8\u6001\u3001\u5e03\u5c14\u903b\u8f91\u3001\u7b97\u672f\u8fd0\u7b97\u548c\u4fe1\u53f7\u5904\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u6a21\u4eff\u8fd9\u79cd\u529f\u80fd\u5bc6\u5ea6\u53ef\u4e3a\u795e\u7ecf\u5f62\u6001\u8ba1\u7b97\u63d0\u4f9b\u5f3a\u5927\u57fa\u5143\uff0c\u66ff\u4ee3\u4f20\u7edf\u6570\u5b57\u8ba1\u7b97\u8303\u5f0f\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u7535\u9a71\u52a8\u5965\u5f17\u5c3c\u514b\u9608\u503c\u5f00\u5173\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5728Sb-Te\u63ba\u6742GeSe\u6750\u6599\u4e2d\u6784\u5efa\u53cc\u7aef\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u81ea\u6301\u52a8\u6001\u548c\u901a\u7528\u5e03\u5c14\u903b\u8f91\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u4f20\u7edf\u9700\u8981\u591a\u4e2a\u7ec4\u4ef6\u7f51\u7edc\u7684XOR\u8fd0\u7b97\u3002", "result": "\u5355\u7ec4\u4ef6\u80fd\u6267\u884c\u8fb9\u7f18\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u68af\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u7f51\u7edc\u53ef\u6784\u5efa\u534a\u52a0\u5668\u548c\u5168\u52a0\u5668\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u6291\u5236\u6027\u548c\u5174\u594b\u6027\u4fe1\u53f7\u7684\u5224\u522b\u903b\u8f91\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u6570\u5b57\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u80fd\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u591a\u4e2a\u6570\u91cf\u7ea7\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u8ba1\u7b97\u57fa\u5143\u4e0d\u4ec5\u7ed3\u6784\u7b80\u5355\uff0c\u4e14\u80fd\u6548\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6570\u5b57\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u4e3a\u6a21\u62df\u6811\u7a81\u529f\u80fd\u3001\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u540e\u6570\u5b57\u795e\u7ecf\u5f62\u6001\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u8f9f\u4e86\u65b0\u8def\u5f84\u3002"}}

GPUs offer massive parallelism that can potentially accelerate SPHINCS+ signatures. However, existing GPU-based optimizations either fail to fully exploit the inherent parallelism of SPHINCS+'s Merkle tree structure or lack fine-grained, compiler-level customization across its diverse computational kernels. This paper proposes HERO Sign, a GPU-accelerated SPHINCS+ implementation that adopts hierarchical tuning and efficient compiler time optimizations. HERO Sign reexamines the parallelization opportunities enabled by data independence across SPHINCS+ components, including FORS, MSS, and WOTS+. It introduces a Tree Fusion strategy for FORS, which contains a large number of independent branches. The fusion strategy is guided by an automated Tree Tuning search algorithm that adapts fusion schemes to different GPU architectures. To further improve performance, HERO Sign employs an adaptive compilation strategy that accounts for the varying effectiveness of compiler optimizations across SPHINCS+ kernels such as FORS Sign, TREE Sign, and WOTS+ Sign. During compilation, the strategy automatically selects between PTX and native code paths to maximize efficiency. For batched signature generation, HERO Sign optimizes kernel-level overlapping using a task graph-based construction to reduce multi-stream idle time and kernel launch overhead. Experimental results show that, compared to state of the art GPU implementations, HERO Sign achieves throughput improvements of 1.28-3.13, 1.28-2.92, and 1.24-2.60 under the SPHINCS+ 128f, 192f, and 256f parameter sets on RTX 4090.

This paper presents Agentic Cloud Data Engineering, a policy-aware control architecture that integrates bounded AI agents into the governance and control plane of cloud data pipelines. In Agentic Cloud Data Engineering platform, specialized agents analyze pipeline telemetry and metadata, reason over declarative cost and compliance policies, and propose constrained operational actions such as adaptive resource reconfiguration, schema reconciliation, and automated failure recovery. All agent actions are validated against governance policies to ensure predictable and auditable behavior. We evaluate Agentic Cloud Data Engineering platform using representative batch and streaming analytics workloads constructed from public enterprise-style datasets. Experimental results show that Agentic Cloud Data Engineering platform reduces mean pipeline recovery time by up to 45%, lowers operational cost by approximately 25%, and decreases manual intervention events by over 70% compared to static orchestration, while maintaining data freshness and policy compliance.

The relevance of gaming, which generates large amounts of market revenue, drove research in modeling network devices' behavior to evaluate bandwidth consumption, predict and sustain high loads, and detect malicious activity. In this context, process mining appears promising due to its ability to combine data-driven analyses with model-based insights. In this paper, we propose a process mining-based method that analyzes gaming network traffic, allowing: unsupervised characterization of different states from gaming network data; encoding such states through process mining into interpretable Petri nets; and classification of gaming network traffic data to identify different video games being played. We apply the method to the UPSIDE case study, involving gaming network data of several devices interacting with two video games: Clash Royale and Rocket League. Results demonstrate that the gaming network behavior can be effectively and interpretably modeled through states represented as Petri nets with sufficient coherence (94.02% inter-device similarity) and specificity (174.99% inter-state separation) while maintaining a good classification accuracy of the two different video games (73.84% AUC).", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u8fc7\u7a0b\u6316\u6398\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u5206\u6790\u6e38\u620f\u7f51\u7edc\u6d41\u91cf\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u5730\u8bc6\u522b\u6e38\u620f\u72b6\u6001\u3001\u901a\u8fc7Petri\u7f51\u7f16\u7801\u8fd9\u4e9b\u72b6\u6001\uff0c\u5e76\u5206\u7c7b\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u6e38\u620f\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u7ebf\u6e38\u620f\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6d41\u884c\u6d3b\u52a8\uff0c\u6d89\u53ca\u590d\u6742\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u548c\u7f51\u7edc\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\uff0c\u4ea7\u751f\u5927\u91cf\u5e02\u573a\u6536\u5165\u3002\u9700\u8981\u5efa\u6a21\u7f51\u7edc\u8bbe\u5907\u884c\u4e3a\u6765\u8bc4\u4f30\u5e26\u5bbd\u6d88\u8017\u3001\u9884\u6d4b\u9ad8\u8d1f\u8f7d\u548c\u68c0\u6d4b\u6076\u610f\u6d3b\u52a8\u3002\u8fc7\u7a0b\u6316\u6398\u56e0\u5176\u7ed3\u5408\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u5206\u6790\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u6d1e\u5bdf\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u800c\u5177\u6709\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u8fc7\u7a0b\u6316\u6398\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a1) \u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u5730\u4ece\u6e38\u620f\u7f51\u7edc\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u8bc6\u522b\u4e0d\u540c\u72b6\u6001\uff1b2) \u901a\u8fc7\u8fc7\u7a0b\u6316\u6398\u5c06\u8fd9\u4e9b\u72b6\u6001\u7f16\u7801\u4e3a\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684Petri\u7f51\uff1b3) \u5bf9\u6e38\u620f\u7f51\u7edc\u6d41\u91cf\u6570\u636e\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u7c7b\u4ee5\u8bc6\u522b\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u6e38\u620f\u3002\u5728UPSIDE\u6848\u4f8b\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u5e94\u7528\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u591a\u4e2a\u8bbe\u5907\u4e0e\u300aClash Royale\u300b\u548c\u300aRocket League\u300b\u4e24\u6b3e\u6e38\u620f\u4ea4\u4e92\u7684\u7f51\u7edc\u6570\u636e\u3002", "result": "\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff1a\u6e38\u620f\u7f51\u7edc\u884c\u4e3a\u53ef\u4ee5\u901a\u8fc7Petri\u7f51\u8868\u793a\u7684\u72b6\u6001\u6709\u6548\u4e14\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u5730\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u8db3\u591f\u7684\u8fde\u8d2f\u6027\uff08\u8bbe\u5907\u95f4\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea694.02%\uff09\u548c\u7279\u5f02\u6027\uff08\u72b6\u6001\u95f4\u5206\u79bb\u5ea6174.99%\uff09\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u5bf9\u4e24\u6b3e\u4e0d\u540c\u89c6\u9891\u6e38\u620f\u7684\u826f\u597d\u5206\u7c7b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff08AUC 73.84%\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fc7\u7a0b\u6316\u6398\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u5206\u6790\u6e38\u620f\u7f51\u7edc\u6d41\u91cf\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u72b6\u6001\u8bc6\u522b\u3001\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u793a\u548c\u6e38\u620f\u5206\u7c7b\uff0c\u4e3a\u6e38\u620f\u7f51\u7edc\u884c\u4e3a\u5efa\u6a21\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u524d\u666f\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Model recovery (MR), which identifies governing equations from sensor data, is a key primitive for safe and explainable monitoring in mission-critical autonomous systems operating under strict latency, compute, and power constraints. However, state-of-the-art MR methods (e.g., EMILY and PINN+SR) rely on Neural ODE formulations that require iterative solvers and are difficult to accelerate efficiently on edge hardware. We present \\textbf{MERINDA} (Model Recovery in Reconfigurable Dynamic Architecture), an FPGA-accelerated MR framework designed to make physical AI practical on resource-constrained devices. MERINDA replaces expensive Neural ODE components with a hardware-friendly formulation that combines (i) GRU-based discretized dynamics, (ii) dense inverse-ODE layers, (iii) sparsity-driven dropout, and (iv) lightweight ODE solvers. The resulting computation is structured for streaming parallelism, enabling critical kernels to be fully parallelized on the FPGA. Across four benchmark nonlinear dynamical systems, MERINDA delivers substantial gains over GPU implementations: \\textbf{114$\\times$ lower energy} (434~J vs.\\ 49{,}375~J), \\textbf{28$\\times$ smaller memory footprint} (214~MB vs.\\ 6{,}118~MB), and \\textbf{1.68$\\times$ faster training}, while matching state-of-the-art model-recovery accuracy.

This paper presents a measurement-driven, container-based resource management framework for intra-node optimization on a single edge server hosting multiple heterogeneous applications. Extensive profiling experiments are conducted to derive a nonlinear fitting model that characterizes the relationship among CPU/memory allocations and processing latency across diverse workloads, enabling reliable estimation of performance under varying configurations and providing quantitative support for subsequent optimization. Using this model and a queueing-based delay formulation, we formulate a mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) problem to jointly minimize system latency and power consumption, which is shown to be NP-hard. The problem is decomposed into tractable convex subproblems and solved through a two-stage container-based resource management scheme (CRMS) combining convex optimization and greedy refinement. The proposed scheme achieves polynomial-time complexity and supports quasi-dynamic execution under global resource constraints.

Like traditional software, DL systems are also prone to faults, whose malfunctioning may expose users to significant risks. Consequently, numerous approaches have been proposed to address these issues. In this paper, we conduct a large-scale empirical study on 16 state-of-the-art DL model fixing approaches, spanning model-level, layer-level, and neuron-level categories, to comprehensively evaluate their performance. We assess not only their fixing effectiveness (their primary purpose) but also their impact on other critical properties, such as robustness, fairness, and backward compatibility. To ensure comprehensive and fair evaluation, we employ a diverse set of datasets, model architectures, and application domains within a uniform experimental setup for experimentation. We summarize several key findings with implications for both industry and academia. For example, model-level approaches demonstrate superior fixing effectiveness compared to others. No single approach can achieve the best fixing performance while improving accuracy and maintaining all other properties. Thus, academia should prioritize research on mitigating these side effects. These insights highlight promising directions for future exploration in this field.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5bf916\u79cd\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u4fee\u590d\u65b9\u6cd5\u8fdb\u884c\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5b9e\u8bc1\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u5176\u4fee\u590d\u6548\u679c\u53ca\u5bf9\u5176\u4ed6\u5173\u952e\u5c5e\u6027\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u6a21\u578b\u7ea7\u65b9\u6cd5\u4fee\u590d\u6548\u679c\u6700\u597d\uff0c\u4f46\u6ca1\u6709\u5355\u4e00\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u5728\u63d0\u9ad8\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u6240\u6709\u5176\u4ed6\u5c5e\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u7cfb\u7edf\u50cf\u4f20\u7edf\u8f6f\u4ef6\u4e00\u6837\u5bb9\u6613\u51fa\u9519\uff0c\u5176\u6545\u969c\u53ef\u80fd\u7ed9\u7528\u6237\u5e26\u6765\u91cd\u5927\u98ce\u9669\u3002\u867d\u7136\u5df2\u6709\u8bb8\u591a\u4fee\u590d\u65b9\u6cd5\u88ab\u63d0\u51fa\uff0c\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u8fd9\u4e9b\u65b9\u6cd5\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5168\u9762\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5b83\u4eec\u5bf9\u5176\u4ed6\u5173\u952e\u5c5e\u6027\uff08\u5982\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3001\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u3001\u5411\u540e\u517c\u5bb9\u6027\uff09\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u5bf916\u79cd\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u4fee\u590d\u65b9\u6cd5\u8fdb\u884c\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5b9e\u8bc1\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u6db5\u76d6\u6a21\u578b\u7ea7\u3001\u5c42\u7ea7\u548c\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\u7ea7\u4e09\u7c7b\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u5728\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u591a\u6837\u5316\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3001\u6a21\u578b\u67b6\u6784\u548c\u5e94\u7528\u9886\u57df\u8fdb\u884c\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u4e0d\u4ec5\u8bc4\u4f30\u4fee\u590d\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u8fd8\u8bc4\u4f30\u5bf9\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3001\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u3001\u5411\u540e\u517c\u5bb9\u6027\u7b49\u5176\u4ed6\u5173\u952e\u5c5e\u6027\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u6a21\u578b\u7ea7\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4fee\u590d\u6548\u679c\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u5176\u4ed6\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1b\u6ca1\u6709\u5355\u4e00\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u5728\u5b9e\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\u4fee\u590d\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u9ad8\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u5e76\u4fdd\u6301\u6240\u6709\u5176\u4ed6\u5c5e\u6027\uff1b\u4fee\u590d\u65b9\u6cd5\u5f80\u5f80\u4f1a\u5bf9\u5176\u4ed6\u5c5e\u6027\u4ea7\u751f\u8d1f\u9762\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5b66\u672f\u754c\u5e94\u4f18\u5148\u7814\u7a76\u51cf\u8f7b\u4fee\u590d\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u526f\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u5de5\u4e1a\u754c\u5728\u9009\u62e9\u4fee\u590d\u65b9\u6cd5\u65f6\u9700\u8981\u6743\u8861\u4fee\u590d\u6548\u679c\u4e0e\u5176\u4ed6\u5c5e\u6027\u7684\u5e73\u8861\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u53d1\u73b0\u4e3a\u8be5\u9886\u57df\u7684\u672a\u6765\u63a2\u7d22\u6307\u660e\u4e86\u6709\u524d\u666f\u7684\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

However, this success comes at the cost of substantial computation and memory requirements, which significantly impedes their deployment in resource-constrained environments. To address this challenge, this work introduces an automation framework that leverages weight pruning and low-bit quantization, and presents a hardware-software co-design method that generates accelerators on the Field-Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) platform. In particular, we implement a unified pipeline that applies N:M structured pruning and 4-bit integer quantization to reduce the memory footprint, followed by optimized dequantization and matrix multiplication to enhance LLM inference on several hardware platforms, including CPUs, NVIDIA GPUs with Dense and 2:4 Sparse Tensor Cores, and a custom systolic-array-based FPGA accelerator. Utilizing 2:4 sparsity combined with quantization on $4096 \\times 4096$ matrices, our approach achieves a reduction of up to $4\\times$ in weight storage and a $1.71\\times$ speedup in matrix multiplication, yielding a $1.29\\times$ end-to-end latency reduction compared to dense GPU baselines. Scaling analysis on the LLaMA-7B model further shows that structured sparsity enhances the throughput per token by $1.36\\times$. These results demonstrate the synergy of fine-grained N:M sparsity and quantization for enabling efficient and deployable LLM inference, while the proposed FPGA accelerator offers a flexible architectural path for supporting a broader class of sparsity patterns beyond the fixed 2:4 hardware constraints.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u7ed3\u5408\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u526a\u679d\u548c\u91cf\u5316\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8f6f\u786c\u4ef6\u534f\u540c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5728FPGA\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548LLM\u63a8\u7406\u52a0\u901f", "motivation": "\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u867d\u7136\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u4f46\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u5185\u5b58\u9700\u6c42\u5de8\u5927\uff0c\u963b\u788d\u4e86\u5728\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u90e8\u7f72\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u52a0\u901f\u65b9\u6848", "method": "\u91c7\u7528N:M\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u526a\u679d\u548c4\u4f4d\u6574\u6570\u91cf\u5316\u51cf\u5c11\u5185\u5b58\u5360\u7528\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u53cd\u91cf\u5316\u548c\u77e9\u9635\u4e58\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728CPU\u3001GPU\u548c\u81ea\u5b9a\u4e49FPGA\u52a0\u901f\u5668\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0LLM\u63a8\u7406\u52a0\u901f", "result": "\u57284096\u00d74096\u77e9\u9635\u4e0a\uff0c2:4\u7a00\u758f\u6027\u4e0e\u91cf\u5316\u7ed3\u5408\u4f7f\u6743\u91cd\u5b58\u50a8\u51cf\u5c114\u500d\uff0c\u77e9\u9635\u4e58\u6cd5\u52a0\u901f1.71\u500d\uff0c\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u5ef6\u8fdf\u964d\u4f4e1.29\u500d\uff1bLLaMA-7B\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u63d0\u53471.36\u500d", "conclusion": "\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6N:M\u7a00\u758f\u6027\u4e0e\u91cf\u5316\u7684\u534f\u540c\u4f5c\u7528\u80fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u53ef\u90e8\u7f72\u7684LLM\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u7684FPGA\u52a0\u901f\u5668\u4e3a\u652f\u6301\u66f4\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u7a00\u758f\u6a21\u5f0f\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7075\u6d3b\u7684\u67b6\u6784\u8def\u5f84"}}

This paper first presents a theoretical analysis of the impact of client data heterogeneity on global model generalization error, which can result in repeated training cycles, increased energy consumption, and prolonged latency. Based on the theoretical insights, an optimization problem is formulated to jointly minimize learning latency and energy consumption while constraining generalization error. A joint client selection and resource allocation (CSRA) approach is then proposed, employing a series of convex optimization and relaxation techniques.

Simulation-based inference (SBI) methods forego the need for explicit likelihoods by directly utilizing samples from the simulator to learn posterior distributions over parameters $\\mathbf\u03b8$ given observed data $\\mathbf{x}_{\\text{o}}$. Recent work has brought attention to diffusion models -- a type of generative model rooted in score matching and reverse-time stochastic dynamics -- as a flexible framework SBI tasks. This article reviews diffusion-based SBI from first principles to applications in practice. We first recall the mathematical foundations of diffusion modeling (forward noising, reverse-time SDE/ODE, probability flow, and denoising score matching) and explain how conditional scores enable likelihood-free posterior sampling. We then examine where diffusion models address pain points of normalizing flows in neural posterior/likelihood estimation and where they introduce new trade-offs (e.g., iterative sampling costs). The key theme of this review is robustness of diffusion-based SBI in non-ideal conditions common to scientific data: misspecification (mismatch between simulated training data and reality), unstructured or infinite-dimensional observations, and missingness.

However, long-context inference remains a significant challenge due to the substantial memory requirements of the key-value (KV) cache, which can scale to several gigabytes as sequence length and batch size increase. In this paper, we present \\textbf{PackKV}, a generic and efficient KV cache management framework optimized for long-context generation. %, which synergistically supports both latency-critical and throughput-critical inference scenarios. PackKV introduces novel lossy compression techniques specifically tailored to the characteristics of KV cache data, featuring a careful co-design of compression algorithms and system architecture. Our approach is compatible with the dynamically growing nature of the KV cache while preserving high computational efficiency. Experimental results show that, under the same and minimum accuracy drop as state-of-the-art quantization methods, PackKV achieves, on average, \\textbf{153.2}\\% higher memory reduction rate for the K cache and \\textbf{179.6}\\% for the V cache. Furthermore, PackKV delivers extremely high execution throughput, effectively eliminating decompression overhead and accelerating the matrix-vector multiplication operation. Specifically, PackKV achieves an average throughput improvement of \\textbf{75.7}\\% for K and \\textbf{171.7}\\% for V across A100 and RTX Pro 6000 GPUs, compared to cuBLAS matrix-vector multiplication kernels, while demanding less GPU memory bandwidth.

Gossman", "Avinash Maurya", "Bogdan Nicolae", "Jon C. Calhoun"], "title": "Understanding LLM Checkpoint/Restore I/O Strategies and Patterns", "comment": "SCA/HPCAsia 2026 Workshops: Supercomputing Asia and International Conference on High Performance Computing in the Asia Pacific Region Workshops", "summary": "As LLMs and foundation models scale, checkpoint/restore has become a critical pattern for training and inference. With 3D parallelism (tensor, pipeline, data), checkpointing involves many processes, each managing numerous tensors of varying shapes and sizes, that must be persisted frequently to stable storage (e.g., parallel file systems). This turns checkpoint/restore into a big-data I/O problem characterized by volume, variety, and velocity. The workflow must traverse the full storage stack -- from GPU memory through host memory and local storage to external repositories -- whose tiers differ by orders of magnitude in performance, creating bottlenecks under concurrency even with asynchronous flush/prefetch. Kernel-accelerated I/O libraries such as \\texttt{liburing} may mitigate these issues versus POSIX, but their effectiveness for LLM checkpointing remains underexplored. We develop microbenchmarks to quantify trade-offs when using \\texttt{liburing}, evaluating how aggregation, alignment, and I/O coalescing interact under buffered and direct I/O. We find that uncoalesced small-buffer operations halve throughput relative to synthetic workloads, while file system-aware aggregation restores bandwidth and reduces metadata overhead. Compared to state-of-the-art LLM checkpointing engines, our approach achieves up to $3.9\\times$ higher write throughput than DataStates-LLM and $7.6\\times$ higher than TorchSnapshot.

We investigate whether this geometric signature persists in production-grade language models. Across Pythia, Phi-2, Llama-3, and Mistral families, we find that last-layer value representations organize along a single dominant axis whose position strongly correlates with predictive entropy, and that domain-restricted prompts collapse this structure into the same low-dimensional manifolds observed in synthetic settings.\n  To probe the role of this geometry, we perform targeted interventions on the entropy-aligned axis of Pythia-410M during in-context learning. Removing or perturbing this axis selectively disrupts the local uncertainty geometry, whereas matched random-axis interventions leave it intact. However, these single-layer manipulations do not produce proportionally specific degradation in Bayesian-like behavior, indicating that the geometry is a privileged readout of uncertainty rather than a singular computational bottleneck. Taken together, our results show that modern language models preserve the geometric substrate that enables Bayesian inference in wind tunnels, and organize their approximate Bayesian updates along this substrate.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u73b0\u4ee3\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4fdd\u7559\u4e86\u652f\u6301\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5176\u503c\u8868\u793a\u6cbf\u7740\u4e0e\u9884\u6d4b\u71b5\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u5355\u4e00\u4e3b\u5bfc\u8f74\u7ec4\u7ec7\uff0c\u8fd9\u79cd\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\u662f\u7279\u6743\u5316\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u8bfb\u53d6\u673a\u5236\u800c\u975e\u5355\u4e00\u8ba1\u7b97\u74f6\u9888\u3002", "motivation": "\u5148\u524d\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\u5c0f\u578btransformer\u5728\u53d7\u63a7\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u7cbe\u786e\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u5e76\u4ea7\u751f\u7f16\u7801\u540e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u57fa\u5e95\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u63a2\u7a76\u8fd9\u79cd\u51e0\u4f55\u7279\u5f81\u662f\u5426\u5b58\u5728\u4e8e\u751f\u4ea7\u7ea7\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u3002", "method": "\u5728Pythia\u3001Phi-2\u3001Llama-3\u548cMistral\u7b49\u6a21\u578b\u5bb6\u65cf\u4e2d\u5206\u6790\u6700\u540e\u4e00\u5c42\u503c\u8868\u793a\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5176\u6cbf\u5355\u4e00\u4e3b\u5bfc\u8f74\u7ec4\u7ec7\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u9488\u5bf9\u6027\u5e72\u9884Pythia-410M\u7684\u71b5\u5bf9\u9f50\u8f74\uff0c\u63a2\u7a76\u8be5\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\u5728\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u73b0\u4ee3\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4fdd\u7559\u4e86\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u57fa\u5e95\uff0c\u503c\u8868\u793a\u6cbf\u5355\u4e00\u4e3b\u5bfc\u8f74\u7ec4\u7ec7\u4e14\u4e0e\u9884\u6d4b\u71b5\u5f3a\u76f8\u5173\u3002\u5e72\u9884\u8be5\u8f74\u4f1a\u7834\u574f\u5c40\u90e8\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u4f46\u4e0d\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u6210\u6bd4\u4f8b\u9000\u5316\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u8be5\u51e0\u4f55\u662f\u7279\u6743\u5316\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u8bfb\u53d6\u673a\u5236\u3002", "conclusion": "\u73b0\u4ee3\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4fdd\u7559\u4e86\u652f\u6301\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u57fa\u5e95\uff0c\u5e76\u6cbf\u6b64\u57fa\u5e95\u7ec4\u7ec7\u5176\u8fd1\u4f3c\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u66f4\u65b0\u3002\u8fd9\u79cd\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\u662f\u7279\u6743\u5316\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u8bfb\u53d6\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u5355\u4e00\u8ba1\u7b97\u74f6\u9888\u3002"}}

The key reason lies in the excessive computation involved in optimizing both the lower- and upper-level functions. Thus, we present the first resource-adaptive distributed bilevel optimization framework with a second-order free hypergradient estimator, which allows each client to optimize the submodels adapted to the available resources. Due to the coupled influence of partial outer parameters x and inner parameters y, it's challenging to theoretically analyze the upper bound regarding the globally averaged hypergradient for full model parameters. The error bound of inner parameter also needs to be reformulated since the local partial training. The provable theorems show that both RABO and RAFBO can achieve an asymptotically optimal convergence rate of $O(1/\\sqrt{C_x^{\\ast}Q})$, which is dominated by the minimum coverage of the outer parameter $C_x^{\\ast}$.

The resulting evidential models can quantify fine-grained uncertainty using learned evidence. However, the Subjective-Logic framework constrains evidence to be non-negative, requiring specific activation functions whose geometric properties can induce activation-dependent learning-freeze behavior: a regime where gradients become extremely small for samples mapped into low-evidence regions. We theoretically characterize this behavior and analyze how different evidential activations influence learning dynamics. Building on this analysis, we design a general family of activation functions and corresponding evidential regularizers that provide an alternative pathway for consistent evidence updates across activation regimes. Extensive experiments on four benchmark classification problems (MNIST, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Tiny-ImageNet), two few-shot classification problems, and blind face restoration problem empirically validate the developed theory and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed generalized regularized evidential models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u8bc1\u636e\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60(EDL)\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u6fc0\u6d3b\u51fd\u6570\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u68af\u5ea6\u6d88\u5931\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u6fc0\u6d3b\u51fd\u6570\u5bb6\u65cf\u548c\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u5b66\u4e60\u505c\u6ede\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "EDL\u6a21\u578b\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e3b\u89c2\u903b\u8f91\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u9ad8\u6548\u5730\u8ba9\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u5177\u5907\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u611f\u77e5\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u4e3b\u89c2\u903b\u8f91\u6846\u67b6\u8981\u6c42\u8bc1\u636e\u5fc5\u987b\u975e\u8d1f\uff0c\u8fd9\u9700\u8981\u4f7f\u7528\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u6fc0\u6d3b\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6fc0\u6d3b\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u7279\u6027\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u6fc0\u6d3b\u4f9d\u8d56\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u505c\u6ede\u884c\u4e3a\uff1a\u5f53\u6837\u672c\u6620\u5c04\u5230\u4f4e\u8bc1\u636e\u533a\u57df\u65f6\uff0c\u68af\u5ea6\u53d8\u5f97\u6781\u5c0f\u3002", "method": "1. \u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u6fc0\u6d3b\u51fd\u6570\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u505c\u6ede\u884c\u4e3a\uff1b2. \u5206\u6790\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u8bc1\u636e\u6fc0\u6d3b\u51fd\u6570\u5bf9\u5b66\u4e60\u52a8\u6001\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff1b3. \u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u901a\u7528\u7684\u6fc0\u6d3b\u51fd\u6570\u5bb6\u65cf\u548c\u76f8\u5e94\u7684\u8bc1\u636e\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u5668\uff0c\u4e3a\u4e0d\u540c\u6fc0\u6d3b\u673a\u5236\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u8bc1\u636e\u66f4\u65b0\u8def\u5f84\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u56db\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u5206\u7c7b\u95ee\u9898\uff08MNIST\u3001CIFAR-10\u3001CIFAR-100\u3001Tiny-ImageNet\uff09\u3001\u4e24\u4e2a\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u5206\u7c7b\u95ee\u9898\u4ee5\u53ca\u76f2\u4eba\u8138\u6062\u590d\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u5e76\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u5e7f\u4e49\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u8bc1\u636e\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u7cfb\u7edf\u5206\u6790\u4e86EDL\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u6fc0\u6d3b\u51fd\u6570\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u505c\u6ede\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u6fc0\u6d3b\u51fd\u6570\u548c\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u68af\u5ea6\u6d88\u5931\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u6548\u7387\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

However, existing resource management approaches remain largely reactive and cluster-centric, limiting their ability to optimize system-wide behavior under dynamic workloads. These limitations result in inefficient resource utilization, delayed adaptation, and increased operational overhead across distributed environments. This paper presents an AI-driven framework for adaptive resource optimization in multi-cluster cloud systems. The proposed approach integrates predictive learning, policy-aware decision-making, and continuous feedback to enable proactive and coordinated resource management across clusters. By analyzing cross-cluster telemetry and historical execution patterns, the framework dynamically adjusts resource allocation to balance performance, cost, and reliability objectives. A prototype implementation demonstrates improved resource efficiency, faster stabilization during workload fluctuations, and reduced performance variability compared to conventional reactive approaches. The results highlight the effectiveness of intelligent, self-adaptive infrastructure management as a key enabler for scalable and resilient cloud platforms.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8eAI\u7684\u591a\u96c6\u7fa4\u4e91\u7cfb\u7edf\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8d44\u6e90\u4f18\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9884\u6d4b\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u7b56\u7565\u611f\u77e5\u51b3\u7b56\u5b9e\u73b0\u8de8\u96c6\u7fa4\u7684\u4e3b\u52a8\u534f\u8c03\u7ba1\u7406\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u53cd\u5e94\u5f0f\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u8d44\u6e90\u6548\u7387\u5e76\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u6027\u80fd\u6ce2\u52a8\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u4ee3\u4e91\u539f\u751f\u7cfb\u7edf\u8d8a\u6765\u8d8a\u591a\u5730\u4f9d\u8d56\u591a\u96c6\u7fa4\u90e8\u7f72\u6765\u652f\u6301\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3001\u5f39\u6027\u548c\u5730\u7406\u5206\u5e03\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u8d44\u6e90\u7ba1\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3b\u8981\u662f\u53cd\u5e94\u5f0f\u548c\u96c6\u7fa4\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u5de5\u4f5c\u8d1f\u8f7d\u4e0b\u4f18\u5316\u7cfb\u7edf\u8303\u56f4\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u8d44\u6e90\u5229\u7528\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u4e0b\u3001\u9002\u5e94\u5ef6\u8fdf\u548c\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u64cd\u4f5c\u5f00\u9500\u589e\u52a0\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2aAI\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8d44\u6e90\u4f18\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u96c6\u6210\u4e86\u9884\u6d4b\u5b66\u4e60\u3001\u7b56\u7565\u611f\u77e5\u51b3\u7b56\u548c\u6301\u7eed\u53cd\u9988\u673a\u5236\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u8de8\u96c6\u7fa4\u9065\u6d4b\u6570\u636e\u548c\u5386\u53f2\u6267\u884c\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u8d44\u6e90\u5206\u914d\u4ee5\u5e73\u8861\u6027\u80fd\u3001\u6210\u672c\u548c\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u76ee\u6807\u3002", "result": "\u539f\u578b\u5b9e\u73b0\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u53cd\u5e94\u5f0f\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u8d44\u6e90\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u5728\u5de5\u4f5c\u8d1f\u8f7d\u6ce2\u52a8\u671f\u95f4\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u5feb\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u5316\uff0c\u5e76\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u6027\u80fd\u53d8\u5f02\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u667a\u80fd\u3001\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\u7ba1\u7406\u662f\u5b9e\u73b0\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u548c\u5f39\u6027\u4e91\u5e73\u53f0\u7684\u5173\u952e\u63a8\u52a8\u56e0\u7d20\uff0c\u4e3a\u591a\u96c6\u7fa4\u4e91\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u7684\u8d44\u6e90\u4f18\u5316\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Many recent time series forecasting models leverage external sources (e.g., news and social media) to capture human factors, but these approaches incur high data dependency costs in terms of financial, computational, and practical implications. In this study, we propose HINTS, a self-supervised learning framework that extracts these latent factors endogenously from time series residuals without external data. HINTS leverages the Friedkin-Johnsen (FJ) opinion dynamics model as a structural inductive bias to model evolving social influence, memory, and bias patterns. The extracted human factors are integrated into a state-of-the-art backbone model as an attention map. Experimental results using nine real-world and benchmark datasets demonstrate that HINTS consistently improves forecasting accuracy.

Common network errors and link fluctuations trigger timeouts that often terminate entire jobs, forcing expensive checkpoint rollback during training and request reprocessing during inference. We present R$^2$CCL, a fault-tolerant communication library that provides lossless, low-overhead failover by exploiting multi-NIC hardware. R$^2$CCL performs rapid connection migration, bandwidth-aware load redistribution, and resilient collective algorithms to maintain progress under failures.

Such systems are often described by coupled (or more) variables, yet governing equation is typically available for one variable, while the remaining variable can be accessed only through data. This mismatch between known physics and observed data poses a fundamental challenge for existing physics-informed machine learning approaches, which generally assume either complete knowledge of the governing equations or full data availability across all variables. In this paper, we introduce MUSIC (Multitask Learning Under Sparse and Incomplete Constraints), a sparsity induced multitask neural network framework that integrates partial physical constraints with data-driven learning to recover full-dimensional solutions of coupled systems when physics-constrained and data-informed variables are mutually exclusive. MUSIC employs mesh-free (random) sampling of training data and sparsity regularization, yielding highly compressed models with improved training and evaluation efficiency. We demonstrate that MUSIC accurately learns solutions (shock wave solutions, discontinuous solutions, pattern formation solutions) to complex coupled systems under data-scarce and noisy conditions, consistently outperforming non-sparse formulations. These results highlight MUSIC as a flexible and effective approach for modeling partially observed systems with incomplete physical knowledge.", "AI": {"tldr": "MUSIC\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u7a00\u758f\u8bf1\u5bfc\u7684\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5728\u7269\u7406\u7ea6\u675f\u548c\u6570\u636e\u4fe1\u606f\u53d8\u91cf\u4e92\u65a5\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u4ece\u90e8\u5206\u7269\u7406\u7ea6\u675f\u4e2d\u6062\u590d\u8026\u5408\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5168\u7ef4\u89e3\u3002", "motivation": "\u590d\u6742\u7cfb\u7edf\u901a\u5e38\u7531\u591a\u4e2a\u8026\u5408\u53d8\u91cf\u63cf\u8ff0\uff0c\u4f46\u901a\u5e38\u53ea\u6709\u4e00\u4e2a\u53d8\u91cf\u7684\u63a7\u5236\u65b9\u7a0b\u5df2\u77e5\uff0c\u5176\u4ed6\u53d8\u91cf\u53ea\u80fd\u901a\u8fc7\u6570\u636e\u83b7\u53d6\u3002\u8fd9\u79cd\u5df2\u77e5\u7269\u7406\u4e0e\u89c2\u6d4b\u6570\u636e\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u5bf9\u73b0\u6709\u7269\u7406\u4fe1\u606f\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u6784\u6210\u4e86\u6839\u672c\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u8fd9\u4e9b\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u5047\u8bbe\u5b8c\u5168\u4e86\u89e3\u63a7\u5236\u65b9\u7a0b\u6216\u6240\u6709\u53d8\u91cf\u90fd\u6709\u5b8c\u6574\u6570\u636e\u3002", "method": "MUSIC\u91c7\u7528\u7a00\u758f\u8bf1\u5bfc\u7684\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u90e8\u5206\u7269\u7406\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0e\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u5b66\u4e60\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\u3002\u5b83\u4f7f\u7528\u65e0\u7f51\u683c\uff08\u968f\u673a\uff09\u91c7\u6837\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u548c\u7a00\u758f\u6b63\u5219\u5316\uff0c\u4ea7\u751f\u9ad8\u5ea6\u538b\u7f29\u7684\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\u6548\u7387\u3002", "result": "MUSIC\u5728\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u548c\u566a\u58f0\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u51c6\u786e\u5b66\u4e60\u590d\u6742\u8026\u5408\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u89e3\uff08\u51b2\u51fb\u6ce2\u89e3\u3001\u4e0d\u8fde\u7eed\u89e3\u3001\u6a21\u5f0f\u5f62\u6210\u89e3\uff09\uff0c\u59cb\u7ec8\u4f18\u4e8e\u975e\u7a00\u758f\u516c\u5f0f\u3002", "conclusion": "MUSIC\u4e3a\u5177\u6709\u4e0d\u5b8c\u5168\u7269\u7406\u77e5\u8bc6\u7684\u90e8\u5206\u89c2\u6d4b\u7cfb\u7edf\u5efa\u6a21\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7075\u6d3b\u6709\u6548\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

However, network traffic classification is a challenging domain, and trained models may degrade soon after deployment due to the obsolete datasets and quick evolution of computer networks as new or updated protocols appear. Moreover, significant change in the behavior of a traffic type (and, therefore, the underlying features representing the traffic) can produce a large and sudden performance drop of the deployed model, known as a data or concept drift. In most cases, complete retraining is performed, often without further investigation of root causes, as good dataset quality is assumed. However, this is not always the case and further investigation must be performed. This paper proposes a novel methodology to evaluate the stability of datasets and a benchmark workflow that can be used to compare datasets.\n  The proposed framework is based on a concept drift detection method that also uses ML feature weights to boost the detection performance.

Comprehensive experiments across three IDS benchmarks (Edge-IIoTset, CIC-IDS2017, UNSW-NB15) demonstrate that ZTA-FL achieves 97.8 percent detection accuracy, 93.2 percent accuracy under 30 percent Byzantine attacks (outperforming FLAME by 3.1 percent, p less than 0.01), and 89.3 percent adversarial robustness while reducing communication overhead by 34 percent.

As a critical hyperparameter for DFL, the mixing matrix controls both the convergence rate and the needs of agent-to-agent communications, and has thus been studied extensively. However, existing designs mostly focused on minimizing the communication time, leaving open the minimization of per-node energy consumption that is critical for energy-constrained devices. This work addresses this gap through a theoretically-justified solution for mixing matrix design that aims at minimizing the maximum per-node energy consumption until convergence, while taking into account the broadcast nature of wireless communications. Based on a novel convergence theorem that allows arbitrarily time-varying mixing matrices, we propose a multi-phase design framework that activates time-varying communication topologies under optimized budgets to trade off the per-iteration energy consumption and the convergence rate while balancing the energy consumption across nodes. Our evaluations based on real data have validated the efficacy of the proposed solution in combining the low energy consumption of sparse mixing matrices and the fast convergence of dense mixing matrices.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u7528\u4e8e\u65e0\u7ebf\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u5206\u6563\u5f0f\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u77e9\u9635\u8bbe\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ee5\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u6bcf\u4e2a\u8282\u70b9\u7684\u6700\u5927\u80fd\u8017\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u8003\u8651\u65e0\u7ebf\u901a\u4fe1\u7684\u5e7f\u64ad\u7279\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u77e9\u9635\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u901a\u4fe1\u65f6\u95f4\uff0c\u800c\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u80fd\u91cf\u53d7\u9650\u8bbe\u5907\u7684\u5173\u952e\u9700\u6c42\u2014\u2014\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u6bcf\u4e2a\u8282\u70b9\u7684\u80fd\u8017\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u586b\u8865\u8fd9\u4e00\u7a7a\u767d\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7406\u8bba\u652f\u6301\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u77e9\u9635\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6765\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u6536\u655b\u524d\u7684\u6700\u5927\u8282\u70b9\u80fd\u8017\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u5141\u8bb8\u4efb\u610f\u65f6\u53d8\u6df7\u5408\u77e9\u9635\u7684\u65b0\u6536\u655b\u5b9a\u7406\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u591a\u9636\u6bb5\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5728\u4f18\u5316\u9884\u7b97\u4e0b\u6fc0\u6d3b\u65f6\u53d8\u901a\u4fe1\u62d3\u6251\uff0c\u6743\u8861\u6bcf\u6b21\u8fed\u4ee3\u7684\u80fd\u8017\u548c\u6536\u655b\u901f\u5ea6\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5e73\u8861\u8282\u70b9\u95f4\u7684\u80fd\u8017\u3002", "result": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6848\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u7ed3\u5408\u7a00\u758f\u6df7\u5408\u77e9\u9635\u7684\u4f4e\u80fd\u8017\u548c\u5bc6\u96c6\u6df7\u5408\u77e9\u9635\u7684\u5feb\u901f\u6536\u655b\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u5de5\u4f5c\u4e3a\u65e0\u7ebf\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u5206\u6563\u5f0f\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u80fd\u8017\u4f18\u5316\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u548c\u5b9e\u7528\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u65f6\u53d8\u6df7\u5408\u77e9\u9635\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u80fd\u8017\u4e0e\u6536\u655b\u901f\u5ea6\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6743\u8861\u3002"}}

SB-TRPO adaptively biases policy updates towards constraint satisfaction while still seeking reward improvement. Concretely, it performs trust-region updates using a convex combination of the natural policy gradients of cost and reward, ensuring a fixed fraction of optimal cost reduction at each step. We provide a theoretical guarantee of local progress towards safety, with reward improvement when gradients are suitably aligned.

RL has been widely applied in various quantitative tasks. However, most methods focus on the spot and could not be directly applied to the futures market with high leverage because of 2 challenges. First, high leverage amplifies reward fluctuations, making training stochastic and difficult to converge. Second, prior works lacked self-awareness of capability boundaries, exposing them to the risk of significant loss when encountering new market state (e.g.,a black swan event like COVID-19). To tackle these challenges, we propose the Efficient and Risk-Aware Ensemble Reinforcement Learning for Futures Trading (FineFT), a novel three-stage ensemble RL framework with stable training and proper risk management. In stage I, ensemble Q learners are selectively updated by ensemble TD errors to improve convergence. In stage II, we filter the Q-learners based on their profitabilities and train VAEs on market states to identify the capability boundaries of the learners. In stage III, we choose from the filtered ensemble and a conservative policy, guided by trained VAEs, to maintain profitability and mitigate risk with new market states. Through extensive experiments on crypto futures in a high-frequency trading environment with high fidelity and 5x leverage, we demonstrate that FineFT outperforms 12 SOTA baselines in 6 financial metrics, reducing risk by more than 40% while achieving superior profitability compared to the runner-up.

We consider preference labels subject to privacy constraints and/or adversarial corruption, and analyze two distinct interplays between them: privacy-first and corruption-first. For the privacy-only setting, we show that log loss with an MLE-style algorithm achieves near-optimal rates, in contrast to conventional wisdom. For the joint privacy-and-corruption setting, we first demonstrate that existing offline algorithms in fact provide stronger guarantees -- simultaneously in terms of corruption level and privacy parameters -- than previously known, which further yields improved bounds in the corruption-only regime. In addition, we also present the first set of results for private and robust online alignment. Our results are enabled by new uniform convergence guarantees for log loss and square loss under privacy and corruption, which we believe have broad applicability across learning theory and statistics.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u4ece\u7406\u8bba\u89d2\u5ea6\u7814\u7a76\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u79c1\u6709\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u79bb\u7ebf\u4e0e\u5728\u7ebf\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e2d\u7684\u6b21\u4f18\u6027\u5dee\u8ddd\u4e0a\u754c\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u9690\u79c1\u7ea6\u675f\u548c\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u8150\u8d25\u4e0b\u7684\u504f\u597d\u6807\u7b7e\u5bf9\u9f50\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u9f50\u9762\u4e34\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u548c\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u653b\u51fb\u7684\u53cc\u91cd\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u7406\u89e3\u9690\u79c1\u7ea6\u675f\u548c\u8150\u8d25\u5e72\u6270\u4e0b\u7684\u5bf9\u9f50\u6027\u80fd\u754c\u9650\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u9690\u79c1\u548c\u8150\u8d25\u4e0b\u7684\u6b21\u4f18\u6027\u5dee\u8ddd\u4e0a\u754c\uff1b\u5206\u6790\u4e24\u79cd\u4ea4\u4e92\u6a21\u5f0f\uff08\u9690\u79c1\u4f18\u5148\u548c\u8150\u8d25\u4f18\u5148\uff09\uff1b\u4f7f\u7528MLE\u98ce\u683c\u7b97\u6cd5\u548clog\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\uff1b\u63d0\u51fa\u65b0\u7684\u5747\u5300\u6536\u655b\u4fdd\u8bc1\u3002", "result": "1) \u7eaf\u9690\u79c1\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e2d\uff0clog\u635f\u5931+MLE\u7b97\u6cd5\u8fbe\u5230\u63a5\u8fd1\u6700\u4f18\u901f\u7387\uff1b2) \u8054\u5408\u9690\u79c1\u8150\u8d25\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e2d\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u79bb\u7ebf\u7b97\u6cd5\u63d0\u4f9b\u6bd4\u5df2\u77e5\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u4fdd\u8bc1\uff1b3) \u9996\u6b21\u63d0\u51fa\u79c1\u6709\u9c81\u68d2\u5728\u7ebf\u5bf9\u9f50\u7ed3\u679c\uff1b4) \u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u9690\u79c1\u548c\u8150\u8d25\u4e0blog\u635f\u5931\u548c\u5e73\u65b9\u635f\u5931\u7684\u5747\u5300\u6536\u655b\u4fdd\u8bc1\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bba\u6587\u4e3a\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u79c1\u6709\u9c81\u68d2\u5bf9\u9f50\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u9690\u79c1\u7ea6\u675f\u548c\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u8150\u8d25\u4e0b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u754c\u9650\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u5747\u5300\u6536\u655b\u4fdd\u8bc1\u5728\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u7edf\u8ba1\u9886\u57df\u5177\u6709\u5e7f\u6cdb\u9002\u7528\u6027\u3002"}}

They rely on linear recurrences to integrate information over time, enabling fast inference, parallelizable training, and control over recurrence stability. However, traditional SSMs often suffer from limited effective memory, requiring larger state sizes for improved recall. Moreover, existing SSMs struggle to capture multi-scale dependencies, which are essential for modeling complex structures in time series, images, and natural language. This paper introduces a multi-scale SSM framework that addresses these limitations by representing sequence dynamics across multiple resolution and processing each resolution with specialized state-space dynamics. By capturing both fine-grained, high-frequency patterns and coarse, global trends, MS-SSM enhances memory efficiency and long-range modeling. We further introduce an input-dependent scale-mixer, enabling dynamic information fusion across resolutions. The proposed approach significantly improves sequence modeling, particularly in long-range and hierarchical tasks, while maintaining computational efficiency.

Previous methods have introduced generative models such as diffusion probabilistic models and Schrodinger bridge models to conditionally generate the missing values from Gaussian noise or directly from linear interpolation results. However, as their prior is not informative to the ground-truth target, their generation process inevitably suffer increased burden and limited imputation accuracy. In this work, we present Bridge-TS, building a data-to-data generation process for generative time series imputation and exploiting the design of prior with two novel designs. Firstly, we propose expert prior, leveraging a pretrained transformer-based module as an expert to fill the missing values with a deterministic estimation, and then taking the results as the prior of ground truth target. Secondly, we explore compositional priors, utilizing several pretrained models to provide different estimation results, and then combining them in the data-to-data generation process to achieve a compositional priors-to-target imputation process.

This paper introduces Trellis, a novel Transformer architecture with bounded memory that learns how to compress its key-value memory dynamically at test time. Trellis replaces the standard KV cache with a fixed-size memory and train a two-pass recurrent compression mechanism to store new keys and values into memory. To achieve this, it leverages an online gradient descent procedure with a forget gate, enabling the compressed memory to be updated recursively while learning to retain important contextual information from incoming tokens at test time.

In practice, the energy-based policies in SAC are often approximated using simple policy classes for efficiency, sacrificing the expressiveness and robustness. In this paper, we propose a variant of the SAC algorithm that parameterizes the policy with flow-based models, leveraging their rich expressiveness. In the algorithm, we evaluate the flow-based policy utilizing the instantaneous change-of-variable technique and update the policy with an online variant of flow matching developed in this paper.

This study presents a comprehensive benchmark of ten deep learning architectures for short-term (1-hour ahead) GHI time series forecasting in Ho Chi Minh City, leveraging high-resolution NSRDB satellite data (2011-2020) to compare established baselines (e.g. LSTM, TCN) against emerging state-of-the-art architectures, including Transformer, Informer, iTransformer, TSMixer, and Mamba. Experimental results identify the Transformer as the superior architecture, achieving the highest predictive accuracy with an R^2 of 0.9696. The study further utilizes SHAP analysis to contrast the temporal reasoning of these architectures, revealing that Transformers exhibit a strong \"recency bias\" focused on immediate atmospheric conditions, whereas Mamba explicitly leverages 24-hour periodic dependencies to inform predictions.

We introduce Stagewise Pairwise Mixers (SPM), a structured linear operator that replaces dense matrices with a composition of sparse pairwise-mixing stages. An SPM layer implements a global linear transformation in $O(nL)$ time with $O(nL)$ parameters, where $L$ is typically constant or $log_2n$, and admits exact closed-form forward and backward computations. SPM is designed as a drop-in replacement for dense linear layers in feedforward networks, recurrent architectures, attention mechanisms, etc. We derive complete forward and backward expressions for two parameterizations: an orthogonal norm-preserving rotation-based variant and a fully general $2 \\times 2$ mixing variant. Beyond computational savings, the stagewise structure of SPM induces an explicit compositional inductive bias that constrains model capacity and improves generalization when aligned with task structure.

We propose that these physical constraints shape dynamics to function not as limitations, but as a temporal inductive bias that breeds generalization. Through a phase-space analysis of signal propagation, we reveal a fundamental asymmetry: expansive dynamics amplify noise, whereas proper dissipative dynamics compress phase space that aligns with the network's spectral bias, compelling the abstraction of invariant features. This condition can be imposed externally via input encoding, or intrinsically through the network's own temporal dynamics. Both pathways require architectures capable of temporal integration and proper constraints to decode induced invariants, whereas static architectures fail to capitalize on temporal structure. Through comprehensive evaluations across supervised classification, unsupervised reconstruction, and zero-shot reinforcement learning, we demonstrate that a critical \"transition\" regime maximizes generalization capability. These findings establish dynamical constraints as a distinct class of inductive bias, suggesting that robust AI development requires not only scaling and removing limitations, but computationally mastering the temporal characteristics that naturally promote generalization.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7269\u7406\u7ea6\u675f\uff08\u5982\u4ee3\u8c22\u9650\u5236\uff09\u53ef\u4f5c\u4e3a\u65f6\u95f4\u5f52\u7eb3\u504f\u7f6e\u4fc3\u8fdb\u6cdb\u5316\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u76f8\u7a7a\u95f4\u5206\u6790\u63ed\u793a\u6269\u5f20\u52a8\u6001\u653e\u5927\u566a\u58f0\u800c\u9002\u5f53\u8017\u6563\u52a8\u6001\u538b\u7f29\u76f8\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u5f3a\u5236\u63d0\u53d6\u4e0d\u53d8\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u5728\u76d1\u7763\u5206\u7c7b\u3001\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u91cd\u5efa\u548c\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u4e34\u754c\"\u8fc7\u6e21\"\u673a\u5236\u6700\u5927\u5316\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u4e13\u6ce8\u4e8e\u65e0\u7ea6\u675f\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u4f46\u751f\u7269\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u4e25\u683c\u4ee3\u8c22\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b\u8fd0\u884c\u3002\u4f5c\u8005\u8ba4\u4e3a\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7269\u7406\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0d\u5e94\u88ab\u89c6\u4e3a\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u800c\u662f\u4f5c\u4e3a\u65f6\u95f4\u5f52\u7eb3\u504f\u7f6e\u5851\u9020\u52a8\u6001\u4ee5\u4fc3\u8fdb\u6cdb\u5316\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u4fe1\u53f7\u4f20\u64ad\u7684\u76f8\u7a7a\u95f4\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u6269\u5f20\u52a8\u6001\u4e0e\u8017\u6563\u52a8\u6001\u7684\u57fa\u672c\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u3002\u63d0\u51fa\u4e24\u79cd\u5b9e\u73b0\u9014\u5f84\uff1a\u5916\u90e8\u901a\u8fc7\u8f93\u5165\u7f16\u7801\u65bd\u52a0\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u6216\u5185\u90e8\u901a\u8fc7\u7f51\u7edc\u81ea\u8eab\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u52a8\u6001\u3002\u9700\u8981\u5177\u5907\u65f6\u95f4\u79ef\u5206\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u9002\u5f53\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u67b6\u6784\u6765\u89e3\u7801\u8bf1\u5bfc\u7684\u4e0d\u53d8\u7279\u5f81\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u76d1\u7763\u5206\u7c7b\u3001\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u91cd\u5efa\u548c\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u7efc\u5408\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e34\u754c\"\u8fc7\u6e21\"\u673a\u5236\u6700\u5927\u5316\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u9759\u6001\u67b6\u6784\u65e0\u6cd5\u5229\u7528\u65f6\u95f4\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u800c\u5177\u5907\u9002\u5f53\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u67b6\u6784\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u53d6\u4e0d\u53d8\u7279\u5f81\u3002", "conclusion": "\u52a8\u6001\u7ea6\u675f\u6784\u6210\u4e00\u7c7b\u72ec\u7279\u7684\u5f52\u7eb3\u504f\u7f6e\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u7a33\u5065AI\u53d1\u5c55\u4e0d\u4ec5\u9700\u8981\u6269\u5c55\u548c\u6d88\u9664\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u66f4\u9700\u8981\u8ba1\u7b97\u638c\u63e1\u81ea\u7136\u4fc3\u8fdb\u6cdb\u5316\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u7279\u6027\u3002\u7269\u7406\u7ea6\u675f\u53ef\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4fc3\u8fdb\u800c\u975e\u9650\u5236\u6cdb\u5316\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u539f\u5219\u3002"}}

In practice, acquiring high-quality labels and making decisions through trial-and-error can be expensive, time-consuming, or risky, particularly in large-scale or high-stakes settings. This dissertation studies interactive machine learning, in which the learner actively influences how information is collected or which actions are taken, using past observations to guide future interactions. We develop new algorithmic principles and establish fundamental limits for interactive learning along three dimensions: active learning with noisy data and rich model classes, sequential decision making with large action spaces, and model selection under partial feedback. Our results include the first computationally efficient active learning algorithms achieving exponential label savings without low-noise assumptions; the first efficient, general-purpose contextual bandit algorithms whose guarantees are independent of the size of the action space; and the first tight characterizations of the fundamental cost of model selection in sequential decision making.

By assigning equal importance to all classes, regardless of their frequency, it promotes fairness and ensures that minority classes are not overlooked. However, directly minimizing the balanced classification loss is typically intractable, which makes the design of effective surrogate losses a central question. This paper introduces and studies two advanced surrogate loss families: Generalized Logit-Adjusted (GLA) loss functions and Generalized Class-Aware weighted (GCA) losses. GLA losses generalize Logit-Adjusted losses, which shift logits based on class priors, to the broader general cross-entropy loss family. GCA loss functions extend the standard class-weighted losses, which scale losses inversely by class frequency, by incorporating class-dependent confidence margins and extending them to the general cross-entropy family. We present a comprehensive theoretical analysis of consistency for both loss families. We show that GLA losses are Bayes-consistent, but only $H$-consistent for complete (i.e., unbounded) hypothesis sets. Moreover, their $H$-consistency bounds depend inversely on the minimum class probability, scaling at least as $1/\\mathsf p_{\\min}$. In contrast, GCA losses are $H$-consistent for any hypothesis set that is bounded or complete, with $H$-consistency bounds that scale more favorably as $1/\\sqrt{\\mathsf p_{\\min}}$, offering significantly stronger theoretical guarantees in imbalanced settings. We report the results of experiments demonstrating that, empirically, both the GCA losses with calibrated class-dependent confidence margins and GLA losses can greatly outperform straightforward class-weighted losses as well as the LA losses.

Yet, the robustness of quantized models against these attacks is little studied compared to large models. Previous defenses propose to inject calculated noise into the prediction probabilities. However, these defenses are limited since they are not incorporated during the model design and are only added as an afterthought after training. Additionally, most defense techniques are computationally expensive and often have unrealistic assumptions about the victim model that are not feasible in edge device implementations and do not apply to quantized models. In this paper, we propose DivQAT, a novel algorithm to train quantized CNNs based on Quantization Aware Training (QAT) aiming to enhance their robustness against extraction attacks. To the best of our knowledge, our technique is the first to modify the quantization process to integrate a model extraction defense into the training process. Through empirical validation on benchmark vision datasets, we demonstrate the efficacy of our technique in defending against model extraction attacks without compromising model accuracy. Furthermore, combining our quantization technique with other defense mechanisms improves their effectiveness compared to traditional QAT.", "AI": {"tldr": "DivQAT\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u91cf\u5316\u611f\u77e5\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u65b0\u578b\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4fee\u6539\u91cf\u5316\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5c06\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u53d6\u9632\u5fa1\u96c6\u6210\u5230\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u91cf\u5316CNN\u5bf9\u63d0\u53d6\u653b\u51fb\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u6a21\u578b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u91cf\u5316CNN\u5bb9\u6613\u53d7\u5230\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u53d6\u653b\u51fb\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u77e5\u8bc6\u4ea7\u6743\u76d7\u7a83\u98ce\u9669\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u9632\u5fa1\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff1a1) \u4f5c\u4e3a\u8bad\u7ec3\u540e\u9644\u52a0\u63aa\u65bd\u800c\u975e\u96c6\u6210\u5230\u6a21\u578b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e2d\uff1b2) \u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\uff1b3) \u5bf9\u53d7\u5bb3\u8005\u6a21\u578b\u6709\u4e0d\u5207\u5b9e\u9645\u7684\u5047\u8bbe\uff1b4) \u4e0d\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u91cf\u5316\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faDivQAT\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u91cf\u5316\u611f\u77e5\u8bad\u7ec3\u4fee\u6539\u91cf\u5316\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u5c06\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u53d6\u9632\u5fa1\u76f4\u63a5\u96c6\u6210\u5230\u8bad\u7ec3\u6d41\u7a0b\u4e2d\u3002\u8fd9\u662f\u9996\u6b21\u901a\u8fc7\u4fee\u6539\u91cf\u5316\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5c06\u9632\u5fa1\u673a\u5236\u878d\u5165\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u6280\u672f\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u57fa\u51c6\u89c6\u89c9\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u8bc1\u9a8c\u8bc1\u8868\u660e\uff1a1) \u80fd\u6709\u6548\u9632\u5fa1\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u53d6\u653b\u51fb\u800c\u4e0d\u635f\u5bb3\u6a21\u578b\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff1b2) \u4e0e\u5176\u4ed6\u9632\u5fa1\u673a\u5236\u7ed3\u5408\u65f6\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edfQAT\u80fd\u63d0\u9ad8\u9632\u5fa1\u6548\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "DivQAT\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u9632\u5fa1\u673a\u5236\u96c6\u6210\u5230\u91cf\u5316\u8bad\u7ec3\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\uff0c\u4e3a\u91cf\u5316CNN\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u53d6\u653b\u51fb\u9632\u5fa1\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u9632\u5fa1\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u8fb9\u7f18\u8bbe\u5907\u5b9e\u73b0\u3002"}}

Traditional data science workflows assume finite datasets and require substantial reimplementation when moving from batch prototypes to streaming production systems. This gap introduces causality violations, batch boundary artifacts, and poor reproducibility of real-time failures.\n  DataFlow resolves these issues through a unified execution model based on directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) with point-in-time idempotency: outputs at any time t depend only on a fixed-length context window preceding t. This guarantee ensures that models developed in batch mode execute identically in streaming production without code changes. The framework enforces strict causality by automatically tracking knowledge time across all transformations, eliminating future-peeking bugs.\n  DataFlow supports flexible tiling across temporal and feature dimensions, allowing the same model to operate at different frequencies and memory profiles via configuration alone. It integrates natively with the Python data science stack and provides fit/predict semantics for online learning, caching and incremental computation, and automatic parallelization through DAG-based scheduling. We demonstrate its effectiveness across domains including financial trading, IoT, fraud detection, and real-time analytics.", "AI": {"tldr": "DataFlow\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u7528\u4e8e\u5728\u65e0\u9650\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u6784\u5efa\u3001\u6d4b\u8bd5\u548c\u90e8\u7f72\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u70b9\u5bf9\u70b9\u5e42\u7b49\u6027\u548c\u56e0\u679c\u6027\u4fdd\u8bc1\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u6279\u5904\u7406\u548c\u6d41\u5904\u7406\u7684\u65e0\u7f1d\u7edf\u4e00\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u6570\u636e\u79d1\u5b66\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u5047\u8bbe\u6709\u9650\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u4ece\u6279\u5904\u7406\u539f\u578b\u8fc1\u79fb\u5230\u6d41\u5904\u7406\u751f\u4ea7\u7cfb\u7edf\u9700\u8981\u5927\u91cf\u91cd\u65b0\u5b9e\u73b0\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u56e0\u679c\u6027\u8fdd\u53cd\u3001\u6279\u8fb9\u754c\u4f2a\u5f71\u548c\u5b9e\u65f6\u6545\u969c\u96be\u4ee5\u590d\u73b0\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u6709\u5411\u65e0\u73af\u56fe\uff08DAG\uff09\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u6267\u884c\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u70b9\u5bf9\u70b9\u5e42\u7b49\u6027\uff1a\u4efb\u4f55\u65f6\u95f4t\u7684\u8f93\u51fa\u4ec5\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8et\u4e4b\u524d\u7684\u56fa\u5b9a\u957f\u5ea6\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7a97\u53e3\u3002\u81ea\u52a8\u8ddf\u8e2a\u6240\u6709\u8f6c\u6362\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u65f6\u95f4\uff0c\u5f3a\u5236\u6267\u884c\u4e25\u683c\u56e0\u679c\u6027\u3002\u652f\u6301\u8de8\u65f6\u95f4\u548c\u7279\u5f81\u7ef4\u5ea6\u7684\u7075\u6d3b\u5206\u5757\u3002", "result": "\u6846\u67b6\u786e\u4fdd\u5728\u6279\u5904\u7406\u6a21\u5f0f\u4e0b\u5f00\u53d1\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u9700\u4ee3\u7801\u66f4\u6539\u5373\u53ef\u5728\u6d41\u5904\u7406\u751f\u4ea7\u4e2d\u76f8\u540c\u6267\u884c\u3002\u539f\u751f\u96c6\u6210Python\u6570\u636e\u79d1\u5b66\u6808\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u5728\u7ebf\u5b66\u4e60\u7684fit/predict\u8bed\u4e49\u3001\u7f13\u5b58\u548c\u589e\u91cf\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u57fa\u4e8eDAG\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u5e76\u884c\u5316\u8c03\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "DataFlow\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u6279\u5904\u7406\u5230\u6d41\u5904\u7406\u7684\u8f6c\u6362\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u91d1\u878d\u4ea4\u6613\u3001\u7269\u8054\u7f51\u3001\u6b3a\u8bc8\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u5b9e\u65f6\u5206\u6790\u7b49\u591a\u4e2a\u9886\u57df\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u6267\u884c\u6a21\u578b\u6d88\u9664\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u4e2d\u7684\u5173\u952e\u7f3a\u9677\u3002"}}

This shift creates an autonomy paradox: as GenAI systems are granted greater operational autonomy, they should, by design, embody more formal structure, more explicit constraints, and stronger tail-risk discipline. We argue stochastic generative models can be fragile in operational domains unless paired with mechanisms that provide verifiable feasibility, robustness to distribution shift, and stress testing under high-consequence scenarios. To address this challenge, we develop a conceptual framework for assured autonomy grounded in operations research (OR), built on two complementary approaches. First, flow-based generative models frame generation as deterministic transport characterized by an ordinary differential equation, enabling auditability, constraint-aware generation, and connections to optimal transport, robust optimization, and sequential decision control. Second, operational safety is formulated through an adversarial robustness lens: decision rules are evaluated against worst-case perturbations within uncertainty or ambiguity sets, making unmodeled risks part of the design. This framework clarifies how increasing autonomy shifts OR's role from solver to guardrail to system architect, with responsibility for control logic, incentive protocols, monitoring regimes, and safety boundaries. These elements define a research agenda for assured autonomy in safety-critical, reliability-sensitive operational domains.", "AI": {"tldr": "GenAI\u6b63\u5728\u4ece\u5bf9\u8bdd\u52a9\u624b\u8f6c\u5411\u81ea\u4e3b\u51b3\u7b56\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u8fd9\u4ea7\u751f\u4e86\u81ea\u4e3b\u6027\u6096\u8bba\uff1a\u81ea\u4e3b\u6027\u8d8a\u9ad8\uff0c\u8d8a\u9700\u8981\u6b63\u5f0f\u7ed3\u6784\u3001\u660e\u786e\u7ea6\u675f\u548c\u5c3e\u90e8\u98ce\u9669\u63a7\u5236\u3002\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u8fd0\u7b79\u5b66\u7684\u4fdd\u8bc1\u81ea\u4e3b\u6027\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u57fa\u4e8e\u6d41\u7684\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u5bf9\u6297\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u6b63\u4ece\u5bf9\u8bdd\u52a9\u624b\u8f6c\u5411\u81ea\u4e3b\u51b3\u7b56\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u8fd9\u79cd\u8f6c\u53d8\u4ea7\u751f\u4e86\u81ea\u4e3b\u6027\u6096\u8bba\uff1a\u7cfb\u7edf\u81ea\u4e3b\u6027\u8d8a\u9ad8\uff0c\u8d8a\u9700\u8981\u6b63\u5f0f\u7ed3\u6784\u3001\u660e\u786e\u7ea6\u675f\u548c\u5c3e\u90e8\u98ce\u9669\u63a7\u5236\u3002\u968f\u673a\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u64cd\u4f5c\u9886\u57df\u53ef\u80fd\u5f88\u8106\u5f31\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u3001\u5bf9\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u79fb\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4ee5\u53ca\u5bf9\u9ad8\u540e\u679c\u573a\u666f\u7684\u538b\u529b\u6d4b\u8bd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u8fd0\u7b79\u5b66\u7684\u4fdd\u8bc1\u81ea\u4e3b\u6027\u6982\u5ff5\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u4e24\u4e2a\u4e92\u8865\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a1) \u57fa\u4e8e\u6d41\u7684\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5c06\u751f\u6210\u89c6\u4e3a\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4f20\u8f93\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u53ef\u5ba1\u8ba1\u6027\u3001\u7ea6\u675f\u611f\u77e5\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u5e76\u4e0e\u6700\u4f18\u4f20\u8f93\u3001\u9c81\u68d2\u4f18\u5316\u548c\u987a\u5e8f\u51b3\u7b56\u63a7\u5236\u8fde\u63a5\uff1b2) \u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u6297\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u89c6\u89d2\u5236\u5b9a\u64cd\u4f5c\u5b89\u5168\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u6216\u6a21\u7cca\u96c6\u5185\u8bc4\u4f30\u51b3\u7b56\u89c4\u5219\u5bf9\u6700\u574f\u60c5\u51b5\u6270\u52a8\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u9610\u660e\u4e86\u968f\u7740\u81ea\u4e3b\u6027\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u8fd0\u7b79\u5b66\u89d2\u8272\u4ece\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u8f6c\u53d8\u4e3a\u62a4\u680f\u518d\u5230\u7cfb\u7edf\u67b6\u6784\u5e08\u7684\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u8d1f\u8d23\u63a7\u5236\u903b\u8f91\u3001\u6fc0\u52b1\u534f\u8bae\u3001\u76d1\u63a7\u673a\u5236\u548c\u5b89\u5168\u8fb9\u754c\u3002\u4e3a\u5b89\u5168\u5173\u952e\u3001\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u654f\u611f\u7684\u64cd\u4f5c\u9886\u57df\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e86\u4fdd\u8bc1\u81ea\u4e3b\u6027\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u8bae\u7a0b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u5411\u81ea\u4e3b\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u8f6c\u53d8\u9700\u8981\u65b0\u7684\u4fdd\u8bc1\u81ea\u4e3b\u6027\u6846\u67b6\u3002\u57fa\u4e8e\u8fd0\u7b79\u5b66\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5fc5\u8981\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u5c06\u57fa\u4e8e\u6d41\u7684\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u5bf9\u6297\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b89\u5168\u5173\u952e\u9886\u57df\u7684\u9ad8\u81ea\u4e3b\u6027\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7cfb\u7edf\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

We begin by noting that classical evaluation metrics such as stress, rank-based neighborhood criteria, or Local Procrustes quantify distortions in distances or in local geometries, but do not directly assess how much information is preserved when projecting high-dimensional data onto a lower-dimensional space. To address this limitation, we introduce the Entropy Rank Preservation Measure (ERPM), a local metric based on the Shannon entropy of the singular-value spectrum of neighborhood matrices and on the stable rank, which quantifies changes in uncertainty between the original representation and its reduced projection, providing neighborhood-level indicators and a global summary statistic. To validate the results of the metric, we compare its outcomes with the Mean Relative Rank Error (MRRE), which is distance-based, and with Local Procrustes, which is based on geometric properties, using a financial time series and a manifold commonly studied in the literature. We observe that distance-based criteria exhibit very low correlation with geometric and spectral measures, while ERPM and Local Procrustes show strong average correlation but display significant discrepancies in local regimes, leading to the conclusion that ERPM complements existing metrics by identifying neighborhoods with severe information loss, thereby enabling a more comprehensive assessment of embeddings, particularly in information-sensitive applications such as the construction of early-warning indicators.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u4fe1\u606f\u8bba\u7684\u5d4c\u5165\u8d28\u91cf\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807ERPM\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u90bb\u57df\u77e9\u9635\u5947\u5f02\u503c\u8c31\u7684\u9999\u519c\u71b5\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a\u79e9\u6765\u91cf\u5316\u4fe1\u606f\u635f\u5931\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u8ddd\u79bb\u6216\u51e0\u4f55\u6307\u6807\u80fd\u66f4\u5168\u9762\u5730\u8bc4\u4f30\u964d\u7ef4\u6548\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u5d4c\u5165\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\uff08\u5982\u5e94\u529b\u3001\u57fa\u4e8e\u6392\u540d\u7684\u90bb\u57df\u6807\u51c6\u3001\u5c40\u90e8Procrustes\uff09\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u8ddd\u79bb\u6216\u5c40\u90e8\u51e0\u4f55\u7684\u5931\u771f\uff0c\u4f46\u65e0\u6cd5\u76f4\u63a5\u8bc4\u4f30\u9ad8\u7ef4\u6570\u636e\u6295\u5f71\u5230\u4f4e\u7ef4\u7a7a\u95f4\u65f6\u4fe1\u606f\u4fdd\u7559\u7684\u7a0b\u5ea6\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u4ece\u4fe1\u606f\u8bba\u89d2\u5ea6\u76f4\u63a5\u91cf\u5316\u4fe1\u606f\u635f\u5931\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u71b5\u79e9\u4fdd\u6301\u5ea6\u91cf\uff08ERPM\uff09\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u90bb\u57df\u77e9\u9635\u5947\u5f02\u503c\u8c31\u7684\u9999\u519c\u71b5\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a\u79e9\u7684\u5c40\u90e8\u5ea6\u91cf\u3002ERPM\u901a\u8fc7\u6bd4\u8f83\u539f\u59cb\u8868\u793a\u548c\u964d\u7ef4\u6295\u5f71\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u90bb\u57df\u7ea7\u6307\u6807\u548c\u5168\u5c40\u6c47\u603b\u7edf\u8ba1\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u91d1\u878d\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u548c\u6587\u732e\u4e2d\u5e38\u7528\u7684\u6d41\u5f62\u6570\u636e\u8fdb\u884c\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u57fa\u4e8e\u8ddd\u79bb\u7684\u6807\u51c6\u4e0e\u51e0\u4f55\u548c\u8c31\u5ea6\u91cf\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u5f88\u4f4e\uff0c\u800cERPM\u4e0e\u5c40\u90e8Procrustes\u663e\u793a\u51fa\u5f3a\u5e73\u5747\u76f8\u5173\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u5c40\u90e8\u533a\u57df\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u5dee\u5f02\u3002ERPM\u80fd\u591f\u8bc6\u522b\u4fe1\u606f\u635f\u5931\u4e25\u91cd\u7684\u90bb\u57df\u3002", "conclusion": "ERPM\u901a\u8fc7\u8bc6\u522b\u4fe1\u606f\u635f\u5931\u4e25\u91cd\u7684\u90bb\u57df\uff0c\u8865\u5145\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u5ea6\u91cf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5bf9\u5d4c\u5165\u7684\u66f4\u5168\u9762\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u6784\u5efa\u65e9\u671f\u9884\u8b66\u6307\u6807\u7b49\u5bf9\u4fe1\u606f\u654f\u611f\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u573a\u666f\u3002"}}

Recent strides in electrocardiogram self-supervised learning (eSSL) have brightened prospects for enhancing representation learning without relying on high-quality annotations. Yet earlier eSSL methods suffer a key limitation: they focus on consistent patterns across leads and beats, overlooking the inherent differences in heartbeats rooted in cardiac conduction processes, while subtle but significant variations carry unique physiological signatures. Moreover, representation learning for ECG analysis should align with ECG diagnostic guidelines, which progress from individual heartbeats to single leads and ultimately to lead combinations. This sequential logic, however, is often neglected when applying pre-trained models to downstream tasks. To address these gaps, we propose CLEAR-HUG, a two-stage framework designed to capture subtle variations in cardiac conduction across leads while adhering to ECG diagnostic guidelines. In the first stage, we introduce an eSSL model termed Conduction-LEAd Reconstructor (CLEAR), which captures both specific variations and general commonalities across heartbeats. Treating each heartbeat as a distinct entity, CLEAR employs a simple yet effective sparse attention mechanism to reconstruct signals without interference from other heartbeats. In the second stage, we implement a Hierarchical lead-Unified Group head (HUG) for disease diagnosis, mirroring clinical workflow. Experimental results across six tasks show a 6.84% improvement, validating the effectiveness of CLEAR-HUG. This highlights its ability to enhance representations of cardiac conduction and align patterns with expert diagnostic guidelines.", "AI": {"tldr": "CLEAR-HUG\uff1a\u4e00\u79cd\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u5fc3\u7535\u56fe\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6355\u6349\u8de8\u5bfc\u8054\u7684\u7ec6\u5fae\u4f20\u5bfc\u53d8\u5316\u5e76\u9075\u5faa\u5fc3\u7535\u56fe\u8bca\u65ad\u6307\u5357\uff0c\u5728\u516d\u4e2a\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e866.84%\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5fc3\u7535\u56fe\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u4e3b\u8981\u95ee\u9898\uff1a1\uff09\u8fc7\u5ea6\u5173\u6ce8\u5bfc\u8054\u548c\u5fc3\u8df3\u95f4\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u5fc3\u810f\u4f20\u5bfc\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u56fa\u6709\u7684\u5fc3\u8df3\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u800c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7ec6\u5fae\u53d8\u5316\u643a\u5e26\u72ec\u7279\u7684\u751f\u7406\u7279\u5f81\uff1b2\uff09\u672a\u80fd\u9075\u5faa\u5fc3\u7535\u56fe\u8bca\u65ad\u7684\u4e34\u5e8a\u6307\u5357\u6d41\u7a0b\uff08\u4ece\u5355\u4e2a\u5fc3\u8df3\u5230\u5355\u5bfc\u8054\u518d\u5230\u5bfc\u8054\u7ec4\u5408\uff09\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u6846\u67b6CLEAR-HUG\uff1a\u7b2c\u4e00\u9636\u6bb5\u4e3aCLEAR\uff08\u4f20\u5bfc-\u5bfc\u8054\u91cd\u5efa\u5668\uff09\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7a00\u758f\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u5c06\u6bcf\u4e2a\u5fc3\u8df3\u89c6\u4e3a\u72ec\u7acb\u5b9e\u4f53\u8fdb\u884c\u4fe1\u53f7\u91cd\u5efa\uff0c\u6355\u6349\u5fc3\u8df3\u95f4\u7684\u7279\u5b9a\u53d8\u5316\u548c\u4e00\u822c\u5171\u6027\uff1b\u7b2c\u4e8c\u9636\u6bb5\u4e3aHUG\uff08\u5206\u5c42\u5bfc\u8054\u7edf\u4e00\u7ec4\u5934\uff09\uff0c\u6a21\u4eff\u4e34\u5e8a\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7a0b\u8fdb\u884c\u75be\u75c5\u8bca\u65ad\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u516d\u4e2a\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0cCLEAR-HUG\u76f8\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e866.84%\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "CLEAR-HUG\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u589e\u5f3a\u5fc3\u810f\u4f20\u5bfc\u7684\u8868\u5f81\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u5e76\u4f7f\u5b66\u4e60\u5230\u7684\u6a21\u5f0f\u4e0e\u4e13\u5bb6\u8bca\u65ad\u6307\u5357\u4fdd\u6301\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u4e3a\u5fc3\u7535\u56fe\u5206\u6790\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u7b26\u5408\u4e34\u5e8a\u5b9e\u8df5\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

However, existing GRL methods often rely on surrogate contrastive objectives or mutual information maximization, which typically demand complex architectures, negative sampling strategies, and sensitive hyperparameter tuning. These design choices may induce over-smoothing, over-squashing, and training instability. In this work, we propose HyperGRL, a unified framework for hyperspherical graph representation learning via adaptive neighbor-mean alignment and sampling-free uniformity. HyperGRL embeds nodes on a unit hypersphere through two adversarially coupled objectives: neighbor-mean alignment and sampling-free uniformity. The alignment objective uses the mean representation of each node's local neighborhood to construct semantically grounded, stable targets that capture shared structural and feature patterns. The uniformity objective formulates dispersion via an L2-based hyperspherical regularization, encouraging globally uniform embedding distributions while preserving discriminative information. To further stabilize training, we introduce an entropy-guided adaptive balancing mechanism that dynamically regulates the interplay between alignment and uniformity without requiring manual tuning. Extensive experiments on node classification, node clustering, and link prediction demonstrate that HyperGRL delivers superior representation quality and generalization across diverse graph structures, achieving average improvements of 1.49%, 0.86%, and 0.74% over the strongest existing methods, respectively.

The reasons behind this divergence remain unclear, as prior studies have largely relied on coarse accuracy metrics. We address this gap by introducing a novel benchmark that decomposes reasoning into atomic core skills such as calculation, fact retrieval, simulation, enumeration, and diagnostic, providing a concrete framework for addressing the fundamental question of what constitutes reasoning in LLMs. By isolating and measuring these core skills, the benchmark offers a more granular view of how specific cognitive abilities emerge, transfer, and sometimes collapse during post-training. Combined with analyses of low-level statistical patterns such as distributional divergence and parameter statistics, it enables a fine-grained study of how generalization evolves under SFT and RL across mathematical, scientific reasoning, and non-reasoning tasks. Our meta-probing framework tracks model behavior at different training stages and reveals that RL-tuned models maintain more stable behavioral profiles and resist collapse in reasoning skills, whereas SFT models exhibit sharper drift and overfit to surface patterns. This work provides new insights into the nature of reasoning in LLMs and points toward principles for designing training strategies that foster broad, robust generalization.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u89e3\u63a8\u7406\u4e3a\u539f\u5b50\u6838\u5fc3\u6280\u80fd\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03(SFT)\u548c\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60(RL)\u8c03\u4f18\u5728LLMs\u4e2d\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u884c\u4e3a\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0RL\u80fd\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u4fdd\u6301\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u4e3b\u8981\u4f9d\u8d56\u7c97\u7c92\u5ea6\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u89e3\u91caLLMs\u5728\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03(SFT)\u548c\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60(RL)\u8c03\u4f18\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u7684\u4e0d\u540c\u6cdb\u5316\u884c\u4e3a\uff1aSFT\u5e38\u5bfc\u81f4\u80fd\u529b\u7a84\u5316\uff0c\u800cRL\u503e\u5411\u4e8e\u4fdd\u6301\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u7684\u5206\u6790\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u7406\u89e3\u8fd9\u79cd\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "method": "1) \u5f15\u5165\u65b0\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u5c06\u63a8\u7406\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u8ba1\u7b97\u3001\u4e8b\u5b9e\u68c0\u7d22\u3001\u6a21\u62df\u3001\u679a\u4e3e\u548c\u8bca\u65ad\u7b49\u539f\u5b50\u6838\u5fc3\u6280\u80fd\uff1b2) \u7ed3\u5408\u5206\u5e03\u5dee\u5f02\u548c\u53c2\u6570\u7edf\u8ba1\u7b49\u4f4e\u5c42\u7edf\u8ba1\u6a21\u5f0f\u5206\u6790\uff1b3) \u4f7f\u7528\u5143\u63a2\u6d4b\u6846\u67b6\u8ffd\u8e2a\u4e0d\u540c\u8bad\u7ec3\u9636\u6bb5\u6a21\u578b\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u5728\u6570\u5b66\u3001\u79d1\u5b66\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u975e\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u6bd4\u8f83SFT\u548cRL\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u6f14\u53d8\u3002", "result": "RL\u8c03\u4f18\u6a21\u578b\u4fdd\u6301\u66f4\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u62b5\u6297\u63a8\u7406\u6280\u80fd\u5d29\u6e83\uff1b\u800cSFT\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u5c16\u9510\u7684\u6f02\u79fb\uff0c\u5bb9\u6613\u8fc7\u62df\u5408\u5230\u8868\u9762\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002\u65b0\u57fa\u51c6\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5bf9LLMs\u63a8\u7406\u672c\u8d28\u7684\u66f4\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u7406\u89e3\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u5de5\u4f5c\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3LLMs\u4e2d\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u672c\u8d28\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u89c1\u89e3\uff0c\u5e76\u6307\u51fa\u4e86\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4fc3\u8fdb\u5e7f\u6cdb\u3001\u7a33\u5065\u6cdb\u5316\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u539f\u5219\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u539f\u5b50\u6280\u80fd\u5206\u89e3\u548c\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u8ba4\u77e5\u80fd\u529b\u6f14\u5316\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002"}}

We propose Temporal Physics-Informed AI (TPI-AI), a hybrid framework that fuses deep temporal representations with physics-inspired interaction cues. A two-layer bidirectional LSTM (Bi-LSTM) encoder learns compact embeddings from multi-step trajectory histories; we concatenate these embeddings with kinematics-, safety-, and interaction-aware features (e.g., headway, TTC, and safe-gap indicators) and train a LightGBM classifier for three-class intention recognition (No-LC, Left-LC, Right-LC). To improve minority-class reliability, we apply imbalance-aware optimization including resampling/weighting and fold-wise threshold calibration. Experiments on two large-scale drone-based datasets, highD (straight highways) and exiD (ramp-rich environments), use location-based splits and evaluate prediction horizons T = 1, 2, 3 s.

Language models typically rely on an autoregressive factorization over tokens. In contrast, our prior work proposed shifting sequential structure to the latent space through a causal Gaussian process, while using a non-autoregressive decoder. Here, we conduct a systematic ablation study of the role played by latent autoregression. We compare (i) a full GP-VAE model with autoregressive latent dynamics, (ii) a non-autoregressive ablation in which latent variables are independent, and (iii) a standard token-level autoregressive Transformer. Our results show that, within the considered regime (medium-scale corpora and short training contexts), latent autoregression induces latent trajectories that are significantly more compatible with the Gaussian-process prior and exhibit greater long-horizon stability. In contrast, removing autoregression leads to degraded latent structure and unstable long-range behavior. These findings highlight the role of latent autoregression as an effective mechanism for organizing long-range structure, while remaining complementary to token-level autoregressive modeling.

Despite the findings of earlier research that has cast doubt on the effectiveness of LLMs leveraging self critique methods, we show significant performance gains on planning datasets in the Blocksworld domain through intrinsic self-critique, without external source such as a verifier. We also demonstrate similar improvements on Logistics and Mini-grid datasets, exceeding strong baseline accuracies. We employ a few-shot learning technique and progressively extend it to a many-shot approach as our base method and demonstrate that it is possible to gain substantial improvement on top of this already competitive approach by employing an iterative process for correction and refinement.

Project: https://tinnerhrhe.github.io/gardo_project", "summary": "Fine-tuning diffusion models via online reinforcement learning (RL) has shown great potential for enhancing text-to-image alignment. However, since precisely specifying a ground-truth objective for visual tasks remains challenging, the models are often optimized using a proxy reward that only partially captures the true goal. This mismatch often leads to reward hacking, where proxy scores increase while real image quality deteriorates and generation diversity collapses. While common solutions add regularization against the reference policy to prevent reward hacking, they compromise sample efficiency and impede the exploration of novel, high-reward regions, as the reference policy is usually sub-optimal. To address the competing demands of sample efficiency, effective exploration, and mitigation of reward hacking, we propose Gated and Adaptive Regularization with Diversity-aware Optimization (GARDO), a versatile framework compatible with various RL algorithms. Our key insight is that regularization need not be applied universally; instead, it is highly effective to selectively penalize a subset of samples that exhibit high uncertainty. To address the exploration challenge, GARDO introduces an adaptive regularization mechanism wherein the reference model is periodically updated to match the capabilities of the online policy, ensuring a relevant regularization target. To address the mode collapse issue in RL, GARDO amplifies the rewards for high-quality samples that also exhibit high diversity, encouraging mode coverage without destabilizing the optimization process. Extensive experiments across diverse proxy rewards and hold-out unseen metrics consistently show that GARDO mitigates reward hacking and enhances generation diversity without sacrificing sample efficiency or exploration, highlighting its effectiveness and robustness.", "AI": {"tldr": "GARDO\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u3001\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u53c2\u8003\u6a21\u578b\u66f4\u65b0\u548c\u591a\u6837\u6027\u5956\u52b1\u589e\u5f3a\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7ebfRL\u5fae\u8c03\u4e2d\u7684\u5956\u52b1\u9ed1\u5ba2\u3001\u63a2\u7d22\u4e0d\u8db3\u548c\u6a21\u5f0f\u5d29\u6e83\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7ebf\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u5fae\u8c03\u4e2d\uff0c\u7531\u4e8e\u4ee3\u7406\u5956\u52b1\u4e0e\u771f\u5b9e\u76ee\u6807\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\uff0c\u5e38\u5bfc\u81f4\u5956\u52b1\u9ed1\u5ba2\uff08\u4ee3\u7406\u5206\u6570\u63d0\u9ad8\u4f46\u771f\u5b9e\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0b\u964d\uff09\u548c\u751f\u6210\u591a\u6837\u6027\u5d29\u6e83\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ee5\u6b21\u4f18\u53c2\u8003\u7b56\u7565\u4e3a\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u4f1a\u635f\u5bb3\u6837\u672c\u6548\u7387\u548c\u63a2\u7d22\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faGARDO\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1) \u9009\u62e9\u6027\u6b63\u5219\u5316\uff1a\u4ec5\u5bf9\u9ad8\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u6837\u672c\u8fdb\u884c\u60e9\u7f5a\uff1b2) \u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u6b63\u5219\u5316\uff1a\u5b9a\u671f\u66f4\u65b0\u53c2\u8003\u6a21\u578b\u4ee5\u5339\u914d\u5728\u7ebf\u7b56\u7565\u80fd\u529b\uff1b3) \u591a\u6837\u6027\u611f\u77e5\u4f18\u5316\uff1a\u5bf9\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u4e14\u9ad8\u591a\u6837\u6027\u7684\u6837\u672c\u589e\u5f3a\u5956\u52b1\uff0c\u9f13\u52b1\u6a21\u5f0f\u8986\u76d6\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u4ee3\u7406\u5956\u52b1\u548c\u672a\u89c1\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cGARDO\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u5956\u52b1\u9ed1\u5ba2\u3001\u589e\u5f3a\u751f\u6210\u591a\u6837\u6027\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4e0d\u727a\u7272\u6837\u672c\u6548\u7387\u6216\u63a2\u7d22\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u663e\u793a\u51fa\u826f\u597d\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "GARDO\u901a\u8fc7\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u3001\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u53c2\u8003\u6a21\u578b\u66f4\u65b0\u548c\u591a\u6837\u6027\u5956\u52b1\u589e\u5f3a\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578bRL\u5fae\u8c03\u4e2d\u5956\u52b1\u9ed1\u5ba2\u3001\u63a2\u7d22\u4e0d\u8db3\u548c\u6a21\u5f0f\u5d29\u6e83\u7684\u7ade\u4e89\u6027\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u4e3a\u6587\u672c\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u5bf9\u9f50\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u3002"}}

Although exact distribution-free conditional coverage is impossible with finite samples, recent work has focused on improving the conditional coverage of standard conformal procedures. Distinct from approaches that target relaxed notions of conditional coverage, we directly minimize the mean squared error of conditional coverage by refining the quantile regression components that underpin many conformal methods. Leveraging a Taylor expansion, we derive a sharp surrogate objective for quantile regression: a density-weighted pinball loss, where the weights are given by the conditional density of the conformity score evaluated at the true quantile.

Learning-based simulators are widely used to compare algorithms, design choices, and interventions under such dynamics, yet evaluation outcomes often exhibit high variance due to random initialisation and learning stochasticity. We analyse the statistical structure of comparative evaluation in these settings and show that standard independent evaluation designs fail to exploit shared sources of randomness across alternatives. We formalise a paired seed evaluation design in which competing systems are evaluated under identical random seeds, inducing matched realisations of stochastic components and strict variance reduction whenever outcomes are positively correlated at the seed level. This yields tighter confidence intervals, higher statistical power, and effective sample size gains at fixed computational budgets. Empirically, seed-level correlations are typically large and positive, producing order-of-magnitude efficiency gains. Paired seed evaluation is weakly dominant in practice, improving statistical reliability when correlation is present and reducing to independent evaluation without loss of validity when it is not.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\"\u914d\u5bf9\u79cd\u5b50\u8bc4\u4f30\u8bbe\u8ba1\"\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8ba9\u7ade\u4e89\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u76f8\u540c\u968f\u673a\u79cd\u5b50\u4e0b\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u968f\u673a\u6027\u5171\u4eab\u6e90\u51cf\u5c11\u65b9\u5dee\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u7edf\u8ba1\u6548\u7387\u548c\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u7cfb\u7edf\u867d\u7136\u770b\u4f3c\u968f\u673a\uff0c\u4f46\u5b9e\u9645\u4e0a\u662f\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u968f\u673a\uff08\u57fa\u4e8e\u79cd\u5b50\u7684\u4f2a\u968f\u673a\u6570\u751f\u6210\u5668\uff09\u3002\u5728\u57fa\u4e8e\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u6a21\u62df\u5668\u4e2d\u8bc4\u4f30\u7b97\u6cd5\u3001\u8bbe\u8ba1\u9009\u62e9\u548c\u5e72\u9884\u65f6\uff0c\u7531\u4e8e\u968f\u673a\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u548c\u5b66\u4e60\u968f\u673a\u6027\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u7ed3\u679c\u901a\u5e38\u5177\u6709\u9ad8\u65b9\u5dee\u3002\u6807\u51c6\u7684\u72ec\u7acb\u8bc4\u4f30\u8bbe\u8ba1\u672a\u80fd\u5145\u5206\u5229\u7528\u4e0d\u540c\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\u4e4b\u95f4\u5171\u4eab\u7684\u968f\u673a\u6e90\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u914d\u5bf9\u79cd\u5b50\u8bc4\u4f30\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u8ba9\u7ade\u4e89\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u76f8\u540c\u7684\u968f\u673a\u79cd\u5b50\u4e0b\u8fdb\u884c\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u8bf1\u5bfc\u968f\u673a\u7ec4\u4ef6\u7684\u5339\u914d\u5b9e\u73b0\u3002\u5f53\u7ed3\u679c\u5728\u79cd\u5b50\u7ea7\u522b\u6b63\u76f8\u5173\u65f6\uff0c\u8fd9\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e25\u683c\u7684\u65b9\u5dee\u51cf\u5c11\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5b58\u5728\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u65f6\u63d0\u9ad8\u7edf\u8ba1\u53ef\u9760\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u6ca1\u6709\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u65f6\u9000\u5316\u4e3a\u72ec\u7acb\u8bc4\u4f30\u800c\u4e0d\u635f\u5931\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u914d\u5bf9\u79cd\u5b50\u8bc4\u4f30\u8bbe\u8ba1\u80fd\u4ea7\u751f\u66f4\u7d27\u7684\u7f6e\u4fe1\u533a\u95f4\u3001\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u7edf\u8ba1\u529f\u6548\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5728\u56fa\u5b9a\u8ba1\u7b97\u9884\u7b97\u4e0b\u83b7\u5f97\u6709\u6548\u7684\u6837\u672c\u91cf\u589e\u76ca\u3002\u5b9e\u8bc1\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u79cd\u5b50\u7ea7\u522b\u7684\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u901a\u5e38\u5f88\u5927\u4e14\u4e3a\u6b63\uff0c\u80fd\u4ea7\u751f\u6570\u91cf\u7ea7\u7684\u6548\u7387\u63d0\u5347\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5b9e\u8df5\u4e2d\u662f\u5f31\u5360\u4f18\u7684\u3002", "conclusion": "\u914d\u5bf9\u79cd\u5b50\u8bc4\u4f30\u8bbe\u8ba1\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u7b80\u5355\u800c\u6709\u6548\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5229\u7528\u7ade\u4e89\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5171\u4eab\u968f\u673a\u6e90\u6765\u63d0\u9ad8\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u7edf\u8ba1\u6548\u7387\u3002\u5f53\u7ed3\u679c\u5728\u79cd\u5b50\u7ea7\u522b\u6b63\u76f8\u5173\u65f6\uff0c\u5b83\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u65b9\u5dee\uff1b\u5373\u4f7f\u6ca1\u6709\u76f8\u5173\u6027\uff0c\u4e5f\u4e0d\u4f1a\u6bd4\u72ec\u7acb\u8bc4\u4f30\u66f4\u5dee\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u5728\u5b9e\u8df5\u4e2d\u5e94\u4f18\u5148\u91c7\u7528\u3002"}}

However, the cost of uncertainty sampling, the high-dimensional phase space, and multiscale stiffness pose severe challenges to both computational efficiency and error control in traditional numerical methods. These aspects are further emphasized in presence of collisions where the high-dimensional nonlocal collision integrations and conservation properties pose severe constraints. To overcome this, we present a variance-reduced Monte Carlo framework for UQ in the Vlasov--Poisson--Landau (VPL) system, in which neural network surrogates replace the multiple costly evaluations of the Landau collision term. The method couples a high-fidelity, asymptotic-preserving VPL solver with inexpensive, strongly correlated surrogates based on the Vlasov--Poisson--Fokker--Planck (VPFP) and Euler--Poisson (EP) equations. For the surrogate models, we introduce a generalization of the separable physics-informed neural network (SPINN), developing a class of tensor neural networks based on an anisotropic micro-macro decomposition, to reduce velocity-moment costs, model complexity, and the curse of dimensionality. To further increase correlation with VPL, we calibrate the VPFP model and design an asymptotic-preserving SPINN whose small- and large-Knudsen limits recover the EP and VP systems, respectively.

The timely prediction of sepsis progression is crucial for reducing adverse outcomes through early intervention. Despite the development of numerous models for Intensive Care Unit (ICU) patients, there remains a notable gap in approaches for the early detection of sepsis in non-ward settings. This research introduces and evaluates four novel machine learning algorithms designed for predicting the onset of sepsis on wearable devices by analyzing heart rate data. The architecture of these models was refined through a genetic algorithm, optimizing for performance, computational complexity, and memory requirements.

Current research is shifting from single-signal to multi-modal collaborative approaches. However, existing multi-modal methods mostly employ fixed or empirical weights, assuming equal reliability across modalities at any given moment. Indeed, the importance of different modalities fluctuates dramatically with UAV motion scenarios, and static weighting amplifies the negative impact of degraded modalities. Furthermore, modal mismatch and weak alignment further undermine cross-scenario generalization. To this end, we propose a reliability-aware dynamic weighting scheme applied to a semantic-aware multi-modal beam prediction framework, named SaM2B. Specifically, SaM2B leverages lightweight cues such as environmental visual, flight posture, and geospatial data to adaptively allocate contributions across modalities at different time points through reliability-aware dynamic weight updates. Moreover, by utilizing cross-modal contrastive learning, we align the \"multi-source representation beam semantics\" associated with specific beam information to a shared semantic space, thereby enhancing discriminative power and robustness under modal noise and distribution shifts. Experiments on real-world low-altitude UAV datasets show that SaM2B achieves more satisfactory results than baseline methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faSaM2B\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u611f\u77e5\u52a8\u6001\u6743\u91cd\u5206\u914d\u548c\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u901a\u4fe1\u4e2d\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6ce2\u675f\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u6a21\u6001\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u6ce2\u52a8\u548c\u6a21\u6001\u5931\u914d\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f4e\u7a7a\u7ecf\u6d4e\u5feb\u901f\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u901a\u4fe1\u9700\u8981\u5feb\u901f\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u6ce2\u675f\u9884\u6d4b\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u65b9\u6cd5\u5927\u591a\u91c7\u7528\u56fa\u5b9a\u6743\u91cd\uff0c\u5047\u8bbe\u5404\u6a21\u6001\u5728\u4efb\u4f55\u65f6\u523b\u90fd\u540c\u7b49\u53ef\u9760\uff0c\u4f46\u5b9e\u9645\u4e0a\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u6001\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u968f\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u8fd0\u52a8\u573a\u666f\u5267\u70c8\u6ce2\u52a8\uff0c\u9759\u6001\u6743\u91cd\u4f1a\u653e\u5927\u9000\u5316\u6a21\u6001\u7684\u8d1f\u9762\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u4e14\u6a21\u6001\u5931\u914d\u548c\u5f31\u5bf9\u9f50\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u524a\u5f31\u8de8\u573a\u666f\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faSaM2B\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1\uff09\u5229\u7528\u73af\u5883\u89c6\u89c9\u3001\u98de\u884c\u59ff\u6001\u548c\u5730\u7406\u7a7a\u95f4\u6570\u636e\u7b49\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u7ebf\u7d22\uff1b2\uff09\u901a\u8fc7\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u611f\u77e5\u52a8\u6001\u6743\u91cd\u66f4\u65b0\uff0c\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u65f6\u95f4\u70b9\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5206\u914d\u5404\u6a21\u6001\u8d21\u732e\uff1b3\uff09\u4f7f\u7528\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u5c06\"\u591a\u6e90\u8868\u793a\u6ce2\u675f\u8bed\u4e49\"\u4e0e\u7279\u5b9a\u6ce2\u675f\u4fe1\u606f\u5bf9\u9f50\u5230\u5171\u4eab\u8bed\u4e49\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u5224\u522b\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u6a21\u6001\u566a\u58f0\u53ca\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u79fb\u4e0b\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u4f4e\u7a7a\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cSaM2B\u6bd4\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u66f4\u4ee4\u4eba\u6ee1\u610f\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "SaM2B\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u6743\u91cd\u5206\u914d\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6ce2\u675f\u9884\u6d4b\u4e2d\u7684\u6a21\u6001\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u6ce2\u52a8\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u901a\u4fe1\u7684\u6ce2\u675f\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

TRL explicitly models the posterior as a probabilistic tube that follows a low-loss valley induced by functional symmetries, using a Fisher/Gauss-Newton metric to separate prior-dominated tangential uncertainty from data-dominated transverse uncertainty. We interpret TRL as a scalable reparametrised Gaussian approximation that utilizes implicit curvature estimates to operate in high-dimensional parameter spaces. Our empirical evaluation on ResNet-18 (CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100) demonstrates that TRL achieves excellent calibration, matching or exceeding the reliability of Deep Ensembles (in terms of ECE) while requiring only a fraction (1/5) of the training cost.

Though, most reasoning system still reply on textual information as the main medium for inference. This limit their effectiveness in spatial tasks such as visual navigation and geo-localization. This work discuss about the potential scope of this field and eventually propose an idea visual reasoning paradigm Geo-Consistent Visual Planning, our introduced framework called Visual Reasoning for Localization, or ViReLoc, which performs planning and localization using only visual representations. The proposed framework learns spatial dependencies and geometric relations that text based reasoning often suffer to understand. By encoding step by step inference in the visual domain and optimizing with reinforcement based objectives, ViReLoc plans routes between two given ground images. The system also integrates contrastive learning and adaptive feature interaction to align cross view perspectives and reduce viewpoint differences. Experiments across diverse navigation and localization scenarios show consistent improvements in spatial reasoning accuracy and cross view retrieval performance. These results establish visual reasoning as a strong complementary approach for navigation and localization, and show that such tasks can be performed without real time global positioning system data, leading to more secure navigation solutions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86ViReLoc\u89c6\u89c9\u63a8\u7406\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528\u89c6\u89c9\u8868\u793a\u8fdb\u884c\u89c4\u5212\u548c\u5b9a\u4f4d\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u4f9d\u8d56\u6587\u672c\u63a8\u7406\u6216\u5b9e\u65f6GPS\u6570\u636e", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u63a8\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e3b\u8981\u4f9d\u8d56\u6587\u672c\u4fe1\u606f\u8fdb\u884c\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u4efb\u52a1\uff08\u5982\u89c6\u89c9\u5bfc\u822a\u548c\u5730\u7406\u5b9a\u4f4d\uff09\u4e2d\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c6\u89c9\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5", "method": "\u63d0\u51faGeo-Consistent Visual Planning\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1ViReLoc\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5b66\u4e60\u7a7a\u95f4\u4f9d\u8d56\u548c\u51e0\u4f55\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u89c6\u89c9\u57df\u9010\u6b65\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u76ee\u6807\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7279\u5f81\u4ea4\u4e92\u6765\u5bf9\u9f50\u8de8\u89c6\u89d2\u5e76\u51cf\u5c11\u89c6\u70b9\u5dee\u5f02", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u6837\u5316\u5bfc\u822a\u548c\u5b9a\u4f4d\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u7a7a\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u8de8\u89c6\u89d2\u68c0\u7d22\u6027\u80fd\u5747\u6709\u6301\u7eed\u63d0\u5347", "conclusion": "\u89c6\u89c9\u63a8\u7406\u6210\u4e3a\u5bfc\u822a\u548c\u5b9a\u4f4d\u7684\u5f3a\u5927\u8865\u5145\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u6b64\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u53ef\u5728\u65e0\u9700\u5b9e\u65f6GPS\u6570\u636e\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u5b8c\u6210\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u5b89\u5168\u7684\u5bfc\u822a\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848"}}

We develop a semiparametric framework for debiased inverse reinforcement learning that yields statistically efficient inference for a broad class of reward-dependent functionals in maximum entropy IRL and Gumbel-shock DDC models. We show that the log-behavior policy acts as a pseudo-reward that point-identifies policy value differences and, under a simple normalization, the reward itself. We then formalize these targets, including policy values under known and counterfactual softmax policies and functionals of the normalized reward, as smooth functionals of the behavior policy and transition kernel, establish pathwise differentiability, and derive their efficient influence functions. Building on this characterization, we construct automatic debiased machine-learning estimators that allow flexible nonparametric estimation of nuisance components while achieving $\\sqrt{n}$-consistency, asymptotic normality, and semiparametric efficiency.

While established for fully supervised data, these techniques remain underexplored in weak-supervision settings such as Positive-Confidence (Pconf) classification. Pconf learning utilizes only positive samples equipped with confidence scores, thereby avoiding the need for negative data. However, existing Pconf methods are ill-suited for high-dimensional regimes. This paper proposes a novel sparse-penalization framework for high-dimensional Pconf classification. We introduce estimators using convex (Lasso) and non-convex (SCAD, MCP) penalties to address shrinkage bias and improve feature recovery. Theoretically, we establish estimation and prediction error bounds for the L1-regularized Pconf estimator, proving it achieves near minimax-optimal sparse recovery rates under Restricted Strong Convexity condition. To solve the resulting composite objective, we develop an efficient proximal gradient algorithm.

Comprehensive experimental validation in application-specific settings is deferred to a companion experimental study", "summary": "Learning systems deployed in nonstationary and safety-critical environments often suffer from instability, slow convergence, or brittle adaptation when learning dynamics evolve over time. While modern optimization, reinforcement learning, and meta-learning methods adapt to gradient statistics, they largely ignore the temporal structure of the error signal itself. This paper proposes a diagnostic-driven adaptive learning framework that explicitly models error evolution through a principled decomposition into bias, capturing persistent drift; noise, capturing stochastic variability; and alignment, capturing repeated directional excitation leading to overshoot. These diagnostics are computed online from lightweight statistics of loss or temporal-difference error trajectories and are independent of model architecture or task domain. We show that the proposed bias-noise-alignment decomposition provides a unifying control backbone for supervised optimization, actor-critic reinforcement learning, and learned optimizers. Building on this framework, we derive diagnostic-driven instantiations including a stabilized supervised optimizer, a diagnostic-regulated actor-critic scheme, and a diagnostic-conditioned learned optimizer. Under standard smoothness assumptions, we establish bounded effective updates and stability properties for all cases. Representative diagnostic illustrations in actor-critic learning highlight how the proposed signals modulate adaptation in response to temporal-difference error structure.

Generative models offer an appealing alternative by learning distributions over plausible system evolutions; yet, most existing approaches focus on next-step conditional prediction rather than the structure of the underlying dynamics. In this work, we reframe forecasting as a fully generative problem by learning the joint probability distribution of lagged system states over short temporal windows and obtaining forecasts through marginalization. This new perspective allows the model to capture nonlinear temporal dependencies, represent multistep trajectory segments, and produce next-step predictions consistent with the learned joint distribution. We also introduce a general, model-agnostic training and inference framework for joint generative forecasting and show how it enables assessment of forecast robustness and reliability using three complementary uncertainty quantification metrics (ensemble variance, short-horizon autocorrelation, and cumulative Wasserstein drift), without access to ground truth. We evaluate the performance of the proposed method on two canonical chaotic dynamical systems, the Lorenz-63 system and the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation, and show that joint generative models yield improved short-term predictive skill, preserve attractor geometry, and achieve substantially more accurate long-range statistical behaviour than conventional conditional next-step models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5c06\u6df7\u6c8c\u7cfb\u7edf\u9884\u6d4b\u91cd\u6784\u4e3a\u5b8c\u5168\u751f\u6210\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5b66\u4e60\u6ede\u540e\u7cfb\u7edf\u72b6\u6001\u7684\u8054\u5408\u6982\u7387\u5206\u5e03\u8fdb\u884c\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u6761\u4ef6\u9884\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u77ed\u671f\u9884\u6d4b\u6280\u80fd\u3001\u5438\u5f15\u5b50\u51e0\u4f55\u4fdd\u6301\u548c\u957f\u671f\u7edf\u8ba1\u884c\u4e3a\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u4f18\u3002", "motivation": "\u6df7\u6c8c\u52a8\u529b\u7cfb\u7edf\u5bf9\u521d\u59cb\u6761\u4ef6\u9ad8\u5ea6\u654f\u611f\u4e14\u5305\u542b\u672a\u89e3\u6790\u7684\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u4f7f\u5f97\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u9884\u6d4b\u5b58\u5728\u6839\u672c\u9650\u5236\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u5927\u591a\u5173\u6ce8\u4e0b\u4e00\u6b65\u6761\u4ef6\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u5e95\u5c42\u52a8\u6001\u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u9884\u6d4b\u91cd\u6784\u4e3a\u5b8c\u5168\u751f\u6210\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b66\u4e60\u77ed\u65f6\u95f4\u7a97\u53e3\u5185\u6ede\u540e\u7cfb\u7edf\u72b6\u6001\u7684\u8054\u5408\u6982\u7387\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8fb9\u7f18\u5316\u83b7\u5f97\u9884\u6d4b\u3002\u63d0\u51fa\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u4e09\u79cd\u4e92\u8865\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u91cf\u5316\u6307\u6807\uff08\u96c6\u5408\u65b9\u5dee\u3001\u77ed\u65f6\u7a0b\u81ea\u76f8\u5173\u3001\u7d2f\u79efWasserstein\u6f02\u79fb\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u5728Lorenz-63\u7cfb\u7edf\u548cKuramoto-Sivashinsky\u65b9\u7a0b\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u8054\u5408\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u76f8\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u4e00\u6b65\u6a21\u578b\uff1a1\uff09\u77ed\u671f\u9884\u6d4b\u6280\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\uff1b2\uff09\u4fdd\u6301\u5438\u5f15\u5b50\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\uff1b3\uff09\u957f\u671f\u7edf\u8ba1\u884c\u4e3a\u663e\u8457\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5c06\u9884\u6d4b\u91cd\u6784\u4e3a\u8054\u5408\u751f\u6210\u95ee\u9898\u80fd\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u6355\u6349\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u65f6\u95f4\u4f9d\u8d56\u3001\u8868\u793a\u591a\u6b65\u8f68\u8ff9\u6bb5\uff0c\u5e76\u4ea7\u751f\u4e0e\u5b66\u4e60\u5206\u5e03\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u4f9b\u65e0\u9700\u771f\u5b9e\u503c\u7684\u7a33\u5065\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\u3002"}}

Recent work has explored leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) as sources of prior causal knowledge, but existing approaches rely on heuristic integration that lacks theoretical grounding. We introduce HOLOGRAPH, a framework that formalizes LLM-guided causal discovery through sheaf theory--representing local causal beliefs as sections of a presheaf over variable subsets. Our key insight is that coherent global causal structure corresponds to the existence of a global section, while topological obstructions manifest as non-vanishing sheaf cohomology. We propose the Algebraic Latent Projection to handle hidden confounders and Natural Gradient Descent on the belief manifold for principled optimization. Experiments on synthetic and real-world benchmarks demonstrate that HOLOGRAPH provides rigorous mathematical foundations while achieving competitive performance on causal discovery tasks with 50-100 variables. Our sheaf-theoretic analysis reveals that while Identity, Transitivity, and Gluing axioms are satisfied to numerical precision (<10^{-6}), the Locality axiom fails for larger graphs, suggesting fundamental non-local coupling in latent variable projections.

Rethinking Proxy-Model Practice", "comment": null, "summary": "Data teams at frontier AI companies routinely train small proxy models to make critical decisions about pretraining data recipes for full-scale training runs. However, the community has a limited understanding of whether and when conclusions drawn from small-scale experiments reliably transfer to full-scale model training. In this work, we uncover a subtle yet critical issue in the standard experimental protocol for data recipe assessment: the use of identical small-scale model training configurations across all data recipes in the name of \"fair\" comparison. We show that the experiment conclusions about data quality can flip with even minor adjustments to training hyperparameters, as the optimal training configuration is inherently data-dependent. Moreover, this fixed-configuration protocol diverges from full-scale model development pipelines, where hyperparameter optimization is a standard step. Consequently, we posit that the objective of data recipe assessment should be to identify the recipe that yields the best performance under data-specific tuning. To mitigate the high cost of hyperparameter tuning, we introduce a simple patch to the evaluation protocol: using reduced learning rates for proxy model training.

Theoretically, we prove that for random-feature models, this approach preserves the ordering of datasets according to their optimal achievable loss.

However, BPTT requires storing the history of all states in the network and then replaying them sequentially backwards in time. This computation appears extremely implausible for the brain to implement. Real Time Recurrent Learning (RTRL) proposes an mathematically equivalent alternative where gradient information is propagated forwards in time locally alongside the regular forward pass, however it has significantly greater computational complexity than BPTT which renders it impractical for large networks. E-prop proposes an approximation of RTRL which reduces its complexity to the level of BPTT while maintaining a purely online forward update which can be implemented by an eligibility trace at each synapse. However, works on RTRL and E-prop ubiquitously investigate learning in a single layer with recurrent dynamics. However, learning in the brain spans multiple layers and consists of both hierarchal dynamics in depth as well as time. In this mathematical note, we extend the E-prop framework to handle arbitrarily deep networks, deriving a novel recursion relationship across depth which extends the eligibility traces of E-prop to deeper layers.

It requires a nuanced reasoning over visual content, contextual cues, and subjective humor. To bridge this gap between visual perception and humorous punchline creation, we propose HUMOR}, a novel framework that guides VLMs through hierarchical reasoning and aligns them with group-wise human preferences. First, HUMOR employs a hierarchical, multi-path Chain-of-Thought (CoT): the model begins by identifying a template-level intent, then explores diverse reasoning paths under different contexts, and finally anchors onto a high-quality, context-specific path. This CoT supervision, which traces back from ground-truth captions, enhances reasoning diversity. We further analyze that this multi-path exploration with anchoring maintains a high expected humor quality, under the practical condition that high-quality paths retain significant probability mass. Second, to capture subjective humor, we train a pairwise reward model that operates within groups of memes sharing the same template. Following established theory, this approach ensures a consistent and robust proxy for human preference, even with subjective and noisy labels.

Existing defenses face a critical dilemma: Adversarial Training (AT) provides robustness but incurs a prohibitive computational burden, while certified methods like Randomized Smoothing (RS) introduce significant inference latency, rendering them impractical for real-time clinical monitoring. We posit that this vulnerability stems from the models' reliance on non-robust spurious correlations rather than invariant pathological features. To address this, we propose Causal Physiological Representation Learning (CPR). Unlike standard denoising approaches that operate without semantic constraints, CPR incorporates a Physiological Structural Prior within a causal disentanglement framework. By modeling ECG generation via a Structural Causal Model (SCM), CPR enforces a structural intervention that strictly separates invariant pathological morphology (P-QRS-T complex) from non-causal artifacts. Empirical results on PTB-XL demonstrate that CPR significantly outperforms standard clinical preprocessing methods. Specifically, under SAP attacks, CPR achieves an F1 score of 0.632, surpassing Median Smoothing (0.541 F1) by 9.1%. Crucially, CPR matches the certified robustness of Randomized Smoothing while maintaining single-pass inference efficiency, offering a superior trade-off between robustness, efficiency, and clinical interpretability.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faCPR\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u56e0\u679c\u89e3\u8026\u6846\u67b6\u5206\u79bb\u5fc3\u7535\u56fe\u4e2d\u7684\u75c5\u7406\u7279\u5f81\u4e0e\u4f2a\u5f71\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u5355\u6b21\u63a8\u7406\u6548\u7387\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u5347\u5bf9\u6297\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5fc3\u7535\u56fe\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u5bf9\u6297\u6270\u52a8\uff08\u7279\u522b\u662f\u6a21\u4eff\u751f\u7269\u5f62\u6001\u7684SAP\uff09\u8106\u5f31\u3002\u5bf9\u6297\u8bad\u7ec3\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\uff0c\u968f\u673a\u5e73\u6ed1\u7b49\u65b9\u6cd5\u63a8\u7406\u5ef6\u8fdf\u5927\uff0c\u4e0d\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5b9e\u65f6\u4e34\u5e8a\u76d1\u6d4b\u3002\u4f5c\u8005\u8ba4\u4e3a\u8106\u5f31\u6027\u6e90\u4e8e\u6a21\u578b\u4f9d\u8d56\u975e\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u4f2a\u76f8\u5173\u800c\u975e\u4e0d\u53d8\u7684\u75c5\u7406\u7279\u5f81\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u56e0\u679c\u751f\u7406\u8868\u5f81\u5b66\u4e60\uff08CPR\uff09\uff0c\u5728\u56e0\u679c\u89e3\u8026\u6846\u67b6\u4e2d\u878d\u5165\u751f\u7406\u7ed3\u6784\u5148\u9a8c\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u6784\u56e0\u679c\u6a21\u578b\u5efa\u6a21\u5fc3\u7535\u56fe\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u6267\u884c\u7ed3\u6784\u5e72\u9884\uff0c\u4e25\u683c\u5206\u79bb\u4e0d\u53d8\u7684\u75c5\u7406\u5f62\u6001\uff08P-QRS-T\u590d\u5408\u6ce2\uff09\u4e0e\u975e\u56e0\u679c\u4f2a\u5f71\u3002", "result": "\u5728PTB-XL\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cCPR\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u6807\u51c6\u4e34\u5e8a\u9884\u5904\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u5728SAP\u653b\u51fb\u4e0b\uff0cCPR\u83b7\u5f970.632\u7684F1\u5206\u6570\uff0c\u6bd4\u4e2d\u503c\u5e73\u6ed1\uff080.541 F1\uff09\u63d0\u53479.1%\u3002CPR\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u5355\u6b21\u63a8\u7406\u6548\u7387\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u5339\u914d\u4e86\u968f\u673a\u5e73\u6ed1\u7684\u8ba4\u8bc1\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "CPR\u5728\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3001\u6548\u7387\u548c\u4e34\u5e8a\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u4e4b\u95f4\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4f18\u8d8a\u7684\u6743\u8861\uff0c\u4e3a\u89e3\u51b3\u5fc3\u7535\u56fe\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u6297\u8106\u5f31\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

However, due to significant privacy concerns surrounding traffic data, most existing methods rely on local training, resulting in data silos and limited knowledge sharing. Federated Learning (FL) offers an efficient solution through privacy-preserving collaborative training; however, standard FL struggles with the non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) problem among clients. This challenge has led to the emergence of Personalized Federated Learning (PFL) as a promising paradigm. Nevertheless, current PFL frameworks require further adaptation for traffic prediction tasks, such as specialized graph feature engineering, data processing, and network architecture design. A notable limitation of many prior studies is their reliance on hyper-parameter optimization across datasets-information that is often unavailable in real-world scenarios-thus impeding practical deployment. To address this challenge, we propose AutoFed, a novel PFL framework for traffic prediction that eliminates the need for manual hyper-parameter tuning. Inspired by prompt learning, AutoFed introduces a federated representor that employs a client-aligned adapter to distill local data into a compact, globally shared prompt matrix.

We developed a novel computational infrastructure to address the data integration challenge, reducing processing time from a projected over 100 days to 3.2 hours through byte-offset indexing architecture, a 740-fold improvement. Our comprehensive analysis revealed critical insights into the multivariate nature of lipophilicity: while molecular weight exhibited weak bivariate correlation with logP, SHAP analysis on ensemble models identified it as the single most important predictor globally. We systematically evaluated multiple modeling approaches, discovering that linear models suffered from inherent heteroskedasticity that classical remediation strategies, including weighted least squares and Box-Cox transformation, failed to address. Tree-based ensemble methods, including Random Forest and XGBoost, proved inherently robust to this violation, achieving an R-squared of 0.765 and RMSE of 0.731 logP units on the test set. Furthermore, a stratified modeling strategy, employing specialized models for drug-like molecules (91 percent of dataset) and extreme cases (nine percent), achieved optimal performance: an RMSE of 0.838 for the drug-like subset and an R-squared of 0.767 for extreme molecules, the highest of all evaluated approaches. These findings provide actionable guidance for molecular design, establish robust baselines for lipophilicity prediction using only 2D descriptors, and demonstrate that well-curated, descriptor-based ensemble models remain competitive with state-of-the-art graph neural network architectures.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5927\u89c4\u6a21logP\u9884\u6d4b\u6846\u67b6\uff1a\u6574\u540842.6\u4e07\u5316\u5408\u7269\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5b57\u8282\u504f\u79fb\u7d22\u5f15\u67b6\u6784\u5c06\u5904\u7406\u65f6\u95f4\u4ece100\u5929\u7f29\u77ed\u81f33.2\u5c0f\u65f6\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5206\u5b50\u91cf\u662flogP\u6700\u91cd\u8981\u9884\u6d4b\u56e0\u5b50\uff0c\u6811\u96c6\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u4f18\u4e8e\u7ebf\u6027\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5206\u5c42\u5efa\u6a21\u7b56\u7565\u53d6\u5f97\u6700\u4f73\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "logP\uff08\u8102\u6c34\u5206\u914d\u7cfb\u6570\uff09\u662f\u836f\u7269\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u5173\u952e\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u9884\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u6570\u636e\u6574\u5408\u56f0\u96be\u3001\u5904\u7406\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u4e0b\u3001\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u6709\u9650\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u5f00\u53d1\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u5927\u89c4\u6a21logP\u9884\u6d4b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u6570\u636e\u6574\u5408\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "method": "1. \u4ecePubChem\u3001ChEMBL\u3001eMolecules\u4e09\u4e2a\u6743\u5a01\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u4ea4\u53c9\u6574\u5408426,850\u4e2a\u751f\u7269\u6d3b\u6027\u5316\u5408\u7269\uff1b2. \u5f00\u53d1\u5b57\u8282\u504f\u79fb\u7d22\u5f15\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0740\u500d\u5904\u7406\u901f\u5ea6\u63d0\u5347\uff1b3. \u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u591a\u79cd\u5efa\u6a21\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u7ebf\u6027\u6a21\u578b\u3001\u968f\u673a\u68ee\u6797\u3001XGBoost\u7b49\uff09\uff1b4. \u4f7f\u7528SHAP\u5206\u6790\u8bc6\u522b\u5173\u952e\u9884\u6d4b\u56e0\u5b50\uff1b5. \u91c7\u7528\u5206\u5c42\u5efa\u6a21\u7b56\u7565\uff1a\u836f\u7269\u6837\u5206\u5b50\uff0891%\uff09\u548c\u6781\u7aef\u5206\u5b50\uff089%\uff09\u5206\u522b\u5efa\u6a21\u3002", "result": "1. \u5904\u7406\u65f6\u95f4\u4ece\u9884\u8ba1100\u5929\u7f29\u77ed\u81f33.2\u5c0f\u65f6\uff1b2. \u5206\u5b50\u91cf\u88ab\u8bc6\u522b\u4e3alogP\u6700\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u5168\u5c40\u9884\u6d4b\u56e0\u5b50\uff1b3. \u6811\u96c6\u6210\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u968f\u673a\u68ee\u6797\u3001XGBoost\uff09\u5bf9\u5f02\u65b9\u5dee\u6027\u5177\u6709\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u96c6R\u00b2=0.765\uff0cRMSE=0.731\uff1b4. \u5206\u5c42\u5efa\u6a21\u7b56\u7565\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f18\uff1a\u836f\u7269\u6837\u5206\u5b50RMSE=0.838\uff0c\u6781\u7aef\u5206\u5b50R\u00b2=0.767\uff1b5. \u4ec5\u4f7f\u75282D\u63cf\u8ff0\u7b26\u7684\u96c6\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u56fe\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u6027\u80fd\u76f8\u5f53\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u5927\u89c4\u6a21logP\u9884\u6d4b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u7cbe\u5fc3\u6784\u5efa\u7684\u63cf\u8ff0\u7b26\u57fa\u96c6\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8102\u6eb6\u6027\u9884\u6d4b\u4e2d\u4ecd\u5177\u6709\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\uff0c\u4e3a\u5206\u5b50\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u6307\u5bfc\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u57fa\u4e8e2D\u63cf\u8ff0\u7b26\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u7a33\u5065\u57fa\u51c6\u3002"}}

We consider backdoor attacks for heterogeneous node classification, where an adversary injects a small set of trigger nodes and connections during training to force specific victim nodes to be misclassified into an attacker-chosen label at test time while preserving clean performance. We propose HeteroHBA, a generative backdoor framework that selects influential auxiliary neighbors for trigger attachment via saliency-based screening and synthesizes diverse trigger features and connection patterns to better match the local heterogeneous context. To improve stealthiness, we combine Adaptive Instance Normalization (AdaIN) with a Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) loss to align the trigger feature distribution with benign statistics, thereby reducing detectability, and we optimize the attack with a bilevel objective that jointly promotes attack success and maintains clean accuracy. Experiments on multiple real-world heterogeneous graphs with representative HGNN architectures show that HeteroHBA consistently achieves higher attack success than prior backdoor baselines with comparable or smaller impact on clean accuracy; moreover, the attack remains effective under our heterogeneity-aware structural defense, CSD. These results highlight practical backdoor risks in heterogeneous graph learning and motivate the development of stronger defenses.", "AI": {"tldr": "HeteroHBA\uff1a\u9488\u5bf9\u5f02\u6784\u56fe\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u540e\u95e8\u653b\u51fb\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u663e\u8457\u6027\u7b5b\u9009\u9009\u62e9\u6709\u5f71\u54cd\u529b\u7684\u8f85\u52a9\u90bb\u5c45\u8282\u70b9\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u591a\u6837\u5316\u7684\u89e6\u53d1\u7279\u5f81\u548c\u8fde\u63a5\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528AdaIN\u548cMMD\u635f\u5931\u5bf9\u9f50\u7279\u5f81\u5206\u5e03\u4ee5\u589e\u5f3a\u9690\u853d\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u6e05\u6d01\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u653b\u51fb\u6210\u529f\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f02\u6784\u56fe\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\uff08HGNNs\uff09\u5728\u8bb8\u591a\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u4f46\u9488\u5bf9\u5f02\u6784\u56fe\u7684\u5b9a\u5411\u540e\u95e8\u6295\u6bd2\u653b\u51fb\u7814\u7a76\u8f83\u5c11\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u653b\u51fb\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5f02\u6784\u56fe\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u6548\u679c\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u66f4\u9690\u853d\u3001\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u7684\u653b\u51fb\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u63ed\u793a\u5f02\u6784\u56fe\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u5b89\u5168\u98ce\u9669\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faHeteroHBA\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u540e\u95e8\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1\uff09\u901a\u8fc7\u663e\u8457\u6027\u7b5b\u9009\u9009\u62e9\u6709\u5f71\u54cd\u529b\u7684\u8f85\u52a9\u90bb\u5c45\u8282\u70b9\u8fdb\u884c\u89e6\u53d1\u8fde\u63a5\uff1b2\uff09\u751f\u6210\u591a\u6837\u5316\u7684\u89e6\u53d1\u7279\u5f81\u548c\u8fde\u63a5\u6a21\u5f0f\u4ee5\u5339\u914d\u5c40\u90e8\u5f02\u8d28\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\uff1b3\uff09\u7ed3\u5408\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5b9e\u4f8b\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\uff08AdaIN\uff09\u548c\u6700\u5927\u5747\u503c\u5dee\u5f02\uff08MMD\uff09\u635f\u5931\u5bf9\u9f50\u89e6\u53d1\u7279\u5f81\u5206\u5e03\u4e0e\u826f\u6027\u7edf\u8ba1\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u9690\u853d\u6027\uff1b4\uff09\u91c7\u7528\u53cc\u5c42\u4f18\u5316\u76ee\u6807\u8054\u5408\u4fc3\u8fdb\u653b\u51fb\u6210\u529f\u5e76\u4fdd\u6301\u6e05\u6d01\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u5f02\u6784\u56fe\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u4ee3\u8868\u6027HGNN\u67b6\u6784\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cHeteroHBA\u76f8\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u540e\u95e8\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u53ef\u6bd4\u6216\u66f4\u5c0f\u6e05\u6d01\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u5f71\u54cd\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u653b\u51fb\u6210\u529f\u7387\uff1b\u653b\u51fb\u5728\u5f02\u6784\u611f\u77e5\u7ed3\u6784\u9632\u5fa1CSD\u4e0b\u4ecd\u7136\u6709\u6548\u3002", "conclusion": "HeteroHBA\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5f02\u6784\u56fe\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u540e\u95e8\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u5f02\u6784\u56fe\u7684\u8106\u5f31\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u5f00\u53d1\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u9632\u5fa1\u673a\u5236\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u52a8\u673a\u548c\u57fa\u51c6\u3002\u8be5\u5de5\u4f5c\u586b\u8865\u4e86\u5f02\u6784\u56fe\u540e\u95e8\u653b\u51fb\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u7a7a\u767d\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u63d0\u5347\u653b\u51fb\u9690\u853d\u6027\u548c\u6709\u6548\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\u3002"}}

However, its performance often degrades significantly due to limited connectivity and data heterogeneity. As we move toward the next generation of wireless networks, mobility is increasingly embedded in many real-world applications. The user mobility, either natural or induced, enables clients to act as relays or bridges, thus enhancing information flow in sparse networks; however, its impact on DFL has been largely overlooked despite its potential. In this work, we systematically investigate the role of mobility in improving DFL performance. We first establish the convergence of DFL in sparse networks under user mobility and theoretically demonstrate that even random movement of a fraction of users can significantly boost performance. Building upon this insight, we propose a DFL framework that utilizes mobile users with induced mobility patterns, allowing them to exploit the knowledge of data distribution to determine their trajectories to enhance information propagation through the network. Through extensive experiments, we empirically confirm our theoretical findings, validate the superiority of our approach over baselines, and provide a comprehensive analysis of how various network parameters influence DFL performance in mobile networks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u7528\u6237\u79fb\u52a8\u6027\u5bf9\u53bb\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\uff08DFL\uff09\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u5229\u7528\u79fb\u52a8\u7528\u6237\u589e\u5f3a\u7a00\u758f\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u4f20\u64ad\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u548c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u53bb\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u7a00\u758f\u7f51\u7edc\u548c\u6570\u636e\u5f02\u6784\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u800c\u4e0b\u4e00\u4ee3\u65e0\u7ebf\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u7528\u6237\u79fb\u52a8\u6027\u65e5\u76ca\u666e\u904d\uff0c\u4f46\u79fb\u52a8\u6027\u5bf9DFL\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u5c1a\u672a\u88ab\u5145\u5206\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u5c3d\u7ba1\u5176\u6709\u6f5c\u529b\u901a\u8fc7\u7528\u6237\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e2d\u7ee7\u6765\u589e\u5f3a\u4fe1\u606f\u6d41\u52a8\u3002", "method": "\u9996\u5148\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u79fb\u52a8\u6027\u4e0b\u7a00\u758f\u7f51\u7edcDFL\u7684\u6536\u655b\u6027\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u5373\u4f7f\u90e8\u5206\u7528\u6237\u7684\u968f\u673a\u79fb\u52a8\u4e5f\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u57fa\u4e8e\u6b64\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u5229\u7528\u79fb\u52a8\u7528\u6237\u7684DFL\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8bf1\u5bfc\u79fb\u52a8\u6a21\u5f0f\u8ba9\u7528\u6237\u6839\u636e\u6570\u636e\u5206\u5e03\u77e5\u8bc6\u786e\u5b9a\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u4ee5\u589e\u5f3a\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u4f20\u64ad\u3002", "result": "\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u8868\u660e\u79fb\u52a8\u6027\u53ef\u4ee5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347DFL\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u5168\u9762\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u5404\u79cd\u7f51\u7edc\u53c2\u6570\u5bf9\u79fb\u52a8\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2dDFL\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7528\u6237\u79fb\u52a8\u6027\u53ef\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u53bb\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u7a00\u758f\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5229\u7528\u79fb\u52a8\u7528\u6237\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4fe1\u606f\u4f20\u64ad\u7684\u4e2d\u7ee7\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u663e\u8457\u6539\u5584DFL\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u4e3a\u4e0b\u4e00\u4ee3\u79fb\u52a8\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u7684\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

In this paper, we present a new learning paradigm, called Nested Learning (NL), that coherently represents a machine learning model with a set of nested, multi-level, and/or parallel optimization problems, each of which with its own context flow. Through the lenses of NL, existing deep learning methods learns from data through compressing their own context flow, and in-context learning naturally emerges in large models. NL suggests a philosophy to design more expressive learning algorithms with more levels, resulting in higher-order in-context learning and potentially unlocking effective continual learning capabilities. We advocate for NL by presenting three core contributions: (1) Expressive Optimizers: We show that known gradient-based optimizers, such as Adam, SGD with Momentum, etc., are in fact associative memory modules that aim to compress the gradients' information (by gradient descent). Building on this insight, we present other more expressive optimizers with deep memory and/or more powerful learning rules; (2) Self-Modifying Learning Module: Taking advantage of NL's insights on learning algorithms, we present a sequence model that learns how to modify itself by learning its own update algorithm; and (3) Continuum Memory System: We present a new formulation for memory system that generalizes the traditional viewpoint of long/short-term memory. Combining our self-modifying sequence model with the continuum memory system, we present a continual learning module, called Hope, showing promising results in language modeling, knowledge incorporation, and few-shot generalization tasks, continual learning, and long-context reasoning tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5d4c\u5957\u5b66\u4e60\uff08NL\uff09\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u5c06\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u793a\u4e3a\u5d4c\u5957\u3001\u591a\u5c42\u6b21\u3001\u5e76\u884c\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u6bcf\u4e2a\u95ee\u9898\u6709\u81ea\u5df1\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u6d41\u3002\u901a\u8fc7NL\u89c6\u89d2\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u538b\u7f29\u81ea\u8eab\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u6d41\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5b66\u4e60\u81ea\u7136\u5728\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u6d8c\u73b0\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u53d6\u5f97\u8fdb\u5c55\uff0c\u4f46\u5173\u4e8e\u6a21\u578b\u5982\u4f55\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60/\u8bb0\u5fc6\u3001\u81ea\u6211\u6539\u8fdb\u548c\u627e\u5230\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u4ecd\u5b58\u5728\u57fa\u672c\u6311\u6218\u548c\u672a\u89e3\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u9700\u8981\u65b0\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u8303\u5f0f\u6765\u8bbe\u8ba1\u66f4\u5177\u8868\u8fbe\u529b\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5d4c\u5957\u5b66\u4e60\uff08NL\uff09\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u5c06\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u793a\u4e3a\u5d4c\u5957\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u57fa\u4e8e\u6b64\u63d0\u51fa\u4e09\u4e2a\u6838\u5fc3\u8d21\u732e\uff1a1\uff09\u8868\u8fbe\u6027\u4f18\u5316\u5668\uff1a\u5c06\u68af\u5ea6\u4f18\u5316\u5668\u89c6\u4e3a\u5173\u8054\u8bb0\u5fc6\u6a21\u5757\uff1b2\uff09\u81ea\u4fee\u6539\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u5757\uff1a\u5b66\u4e60\u5982\u4f55\u4fee\u6539\u81ea\u8eab\u7684\u5e8f\u5217\u6a21\u578b\uff1b3\uff09\u8fde\u7eed\u8bb0\u5fc6\u7cfb\u7edf\uff1a\u63a8\u5e7f\u4f20\u7edf\u957f/\u77ed\u671f\u8bb0\u5fc6\u89c2\u70b9\u3002\u7ed3\u5408\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7ec4\u4ef6\u6784\u5efa\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u5757Hope\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u5757Hope\u5728\u8bed\u8a00\u5efa\u6a21\u3001\u77e5\u8bc6\u6574\u5408\u3001\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u6cdb\u5316\u4efb\u52a1\u3001\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u663e\u793a\u51fa\u6709\u5e0c\u671b\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5d4c\u5957\u5b66\u4e60\u4e3a\u8bbe\u8ba1\u66f4\u5177\u8868\u8fbe\u529b\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u7b97\u6cd5\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u54f2\u5b66\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u589e\u52a0\u5c42\u7ea7\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u9636\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u6709\u671b\u89e3\u9501\u6709\u6548\u7684\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u8be5\u8303\u5f0f\u4e3a\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

The method first isolates pervasive latent effects by decomposing the observed precision matrix into a structured component and a low-rank component. The structured component corresponds to the conditional distribution after accounting for pervasive confounders and retains only local dependence induced by the causal graph and localized confounding. A correlated-noise DAG learner is then applied to this deconfounded representation to recover directed edges while modeling remaining structured error correlations, followed by a simple reconciliation step to enforce bow-freeness.\n  We provide identifiability results that characterize the recoverable causal target under mixed confounding and show how the overall problem reduces to well-studied subproblems with modular guarantees.

However, the nature of transfer, its transitive-intransitive nature, is still an open problem, and negative transfer remains a significant obstacle. Selection of beneficial auxiliary task sets in multi-task learning is frequently hindered by the high computational cost of their evaluation, the high number of plausible candidate auxiliary sets, and the varying complexity of selection across target tasks.\n  To address these constraints, we introduce BandiK, a novel three-stage multi-task auxiliary task subset selection method using multi-bandits, where each arm pull evaluates candidate auxiliary sets by training and testing a multiple output neural network on a single random train-test dataset split. Firstly, BandiK estimates the pairwise transfers between tasks, which helps in identifying which tasks are likely to benefit from joint learning. In the second stage, it constructs a linear number of candidate sets of auxiliary tasks (in the number of all tasks) for each target task based on the initial estimations, significantly reducing the exponential number of potential auxiliary task sets. Thirdly, it employs a Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB) framework for each task, where the arms correspond to the performance of candidate auxiliary sets realized as multiple output neural networks over train-test data set splits. To enhance efficiency, BandiK integrates these individual task-specific MABs into a multi-bandit structure. The proposed multi-bandit solution exploits that the same neural network realizes multiple arms of different individual bandits corresponding to a given candidate set.

While existing literature has explored user acceptance of autonomous taxis through stated preference experiments and hypothetical scenarios, few studies have investigated actual user behavior based on operational AV services. This study addresses that gap by leveraging survey data from Wuhan, China, where Baidu's Apollo Robotaxi service operates at scale. We design a realistic survey incorporating actual service attributes and collect 336 valid responses from actual users. Using Structural Equation Modeling, we identify six latent psychological constructs, namely Trust \\& Policy Support, Cost Sensitivity, Performance, Behavioral Intention, Lifestyle, and Education. Their influences on adoption behavior, measured by the selection frequency of autonomous taxis in ten scenarios, are examined and interpreted. Results show that Cost Sensitivity and Behavioral Intention are the strongest positive predictors of adoption, while other latent constructs play more nuanced roles. The model demonstrates strong goodness-of-fit across multiple indices. Our findings offer empirical evidence to support policymaking, fare design, and public outreach strategies for scaling autonomous taxis deployments in real-world urban settings.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u6b66\u6c49\u767e\u5ea6Apollo Robotaxi\u5b9e\u9645\u8fd0\u8425\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u6784\u65b9\u7a0b\u6a21\u578b\u5206\u6790\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u51fa\u79df\u8f66\u7528\u6237\u91c7\u7eb3\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u6210\u672c\u654f\u611f\u6027\u548c\u884c\u4e3a\u610f\u5411\u662f\u6700\u5f3a\u9884\u6d4b\u56e0\u5b50\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u591a\u57fa\u4e8e\u5047\u8bbe\u573a\u666f\u548c\u9648\u8ff0\u504f\u597d\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u57fa\u4e8e\u5b9e\u9645\u8fd0\u8425\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u51fa\u79df\u8f66\u670d\u52a1\u7684\u7528\u6237\u884c\u4e3a\u7814\u7a76\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u586b\u8865\u8fd9\u4e00\u7a7a\u767d\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u6b66\u6c49\u767e\u5ea6Apollo Robotaxi\u5b9e\u9645\u8fd0\u8425\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u771f\u5b9e\u7528\u6237\u91c7\u7eb3\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "method": "\u5728\u6b66\u6c49\u6536\u96c6336\u4efd\u6709\u6548\u95ee\u5377\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5305\u542b\u5b9e\u9645\u670d\u52a1\u5c5e\u6027\u7684\u8c03\u67e5\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u7ed3\u6784\u65b9\u7a0b\u6a21\u578b\u8bc6\u522b\u516d\u4e2a\u6f5c\u5728\u5fc3\u7406\u6784\u5ff5\uff08\u4fe1\u4efb\u4e0e\u653f\u7b56\u652f\u6301\u3001\u6210\u672c\u654f\u611f\u6027\u3001\u6027\u80fd\u3001\u884c\u4e3a\u610f\u5411\u3001\u751f\u6d3b\u65b9\u5f0f\u3001\u6559\u80b2\uff09\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u5b83\u4eec\u5bf910\u4e2a\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u51fa\u79df\u8f66\u9009\u62e9\u9891\u7387\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u6210\u672c\u654f\u611f\u6027\u548c\u884c\u4e3a\u610f\u5411\u662f\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u51fa\u79df\u8f66\u91c7\u7eb3\u7684\u6700\u5f3a\u6b63\u5411\u9884\u6d4b\u56e0\u5b50\uff0c\u5176\u4ed6\u6f5c\u5728\u6784\u5ff5\u4f5c\u7528\u66f4\u4e3a\u5fae\u5999\u3002\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u62df\u5408\u6307\u6570\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u826f\u597d\u7684\u62df\u5408\u4f18\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u4e3a\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u51fa\u79df\u8f66\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u57ce\u5e02\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u653f\u7b56\u5236\u5b9a\u3001\u7968\u4ef7\u8bbe\u8ba1\u548c\u516c\u4f17\u63a8\u5e7f\u7b56\u7565\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u8bc1\u4f9d\u636e\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u89c4\u6a21\u5316\u90e8\u7f72\u3002"}}

These phenomena appear across architectures -- in attention mechanisms, classification heads, and energy-based models -- yet existing explanations rely on loose analogies to mixture models or post-hoc architectural interpretation. We provide a direct derivation. For any objective with log-sum-exp structure over distances or energies, the gradient with respect to each distance is exactly the negative posterior responsibility of the corresponding component: $\\partial L / \\partial d_j = -r_j$. This is an algebraic identity, not an approximation. The immediate consequence is that gradient descent on such objectives performs expectation-maximization implicitly -- responsibilities are not auxiliary variables to be computed but gradients to be applied. No explicit inference algorithm is required because inference is embedded in optimization. This result unifies three regimes of learning under a single mechanism: unsupervised mixture modeling, where responsibilities are fully latent; attention, where responsibilities are conditioned on queries; and cross-entropy classification, where supervision clamps responsibilities to targets. The Bayesian structure recently observed in trained transformers is not an emergent property but a necessary consequence of the objective geometry.

Nash learning from human feedback (NLHF) addresses this by framing non-transitive preferences as a two-player zero-sum game, where alignment reduces to finding the Nash equilibrium (NE). However, existing algorithms typically rely on regularization, incurring unavoidable bias when computing the duality gap in the original game. In this work, we provide the first convergence guarantee for Optimistic Multiplicative Weights Update ($\\mathtt{OMWU}$) in NLHF, showing that it achieves last-iterate linear convergence after a burn-in phase whenever an NE with full support exists, with an instance-dependent linear convergence rate to the original NE, measured by duality gaps. Compared to prior results in Wei et al. (2020), we do not require the assumption of NE uniqueness. Our analysis identifies a novel marginal convergence behavior, where the probability of rarely played actions grows exponentially from exponentially small values, enabling exponentially better dependence on instance-dependent constants than prior results.

In multi-agent settings, the exponential growth of the joint state space with the number of agents makes coordinated behaviours even more valuable. Yet, this same exponential growth renders the design of multi-agent options particularly challenging. Existing multi-agent option discovery methods often sacrifice coordination by producing loosely coupled or fully independent behaviours. Toward addressing these limitations, we describe a novel approach for multi-agent option discovery. Specifically, we propose a joint-state abstraction that compresses the state space while preserving the information necessary to discover strongly coordinated behaviours. Our approach builds on the inductive bias that synchronisation over agent states provides a natural foundation for coordination in the absence of explicit objectives. We first approximate a fictitious state of maximal alignment with the team, the \\textit{Fermat} state, and use it to define a measure of \\textit{spreadness}, capturing team-level misalignment on each individual state dimension. Building on this representation, we then employ a neural graph Laplacian estimator to derive options that capture state synchronisation patterns between agents. We evaluate the resulting options across multiple scenarios in two multi-agent domains, showing that they yield stronger downstream coordination capabilities compared to alternative option discovery methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u9009\u9879\u53d1\u73b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8054\u5408\u72b6\u6001\u62bd\u8c61\u548c\u8d39\u9a6c\u72b6\u6001\u8fd1\u4f3c\u6765\u53d1\u73b0\u5f3a\u534f\u8c03\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u4ea7\u751f\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u4e0b\u6e38\u534f\u8c03\u80fd\u529b", "motivation": "\u5728\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\uff0c\u8054\u5408\u72b6\u6001\u7a7a\u95f4\u968f\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6570\u91cf\u5448\u6307\u6570\u589e\u957f\uff0c\u4f7f\u5f97\u534f\u8c03\u884c\u4e3a\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7279\u522b\u56f0\u96be\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5f80\u5f80\u727a\u7272\u534f\u8c03\u6027\uff0c\u4ea7\u751f\u677e\u6563\u8026\u5408\u6216\u5b8c\u5168\u72ec\u7acb\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e00\u5c40\u9650\u6027", "method": "1) \u63d0\u51fa\u8054\u5408\u72b6\u6001\u62bd\u8c61\uff0c\u538b\u7f29\u72b6\u6001\u7a7a\u95f4\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u7559\u53d1\u73b0\u5f3a\u534f\u8c03\u884c\u4e3a\u6240\u9700\u4fe1\u606f\uff1b2) \u57fa\u4e8e\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u72b6\u6001\u540c\u6b65\u7684\u5f52\u7eb3\u504f\u7f6e\uff1b3) \u8fd1\u4f3c\u6700\u5927\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u865a\u6784\u8d39\u9a6c\u72b6\u6001\uff1b4) \u5b9a\u4e49\u8861\u91cf\u56e2\u961f\u7ea7\u4e0d\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u6269\u6563\u5ea6\uff1b5) \u4f7f\u7528\u795e\u7ecf\u56fe\u62c9\u666e\u62c9\u65af\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\u63a8\u5bfc\u6355\u6349\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u95f4\u72b6\u6001\u540c\u6b65\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684\u9009\u9879", "result": "\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u9886\u57df\u7684\u591a\u4e2a\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ea7\u751f\u7684\u9009\u9879\u76f8\u6bd4\u5176\u4ed6\u9009\u9879\u53d1\u73b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u4e0b\u6e38\u534f\u8c03\u80fd\u529b", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u8054\u5408\u72b6\u6001\u62bd\u8c61\u548c\u8d39\u9a6c\u72b6\u6001\u8fd1\u4f3c\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u53d1\u73b0\u4fc3\u8fdb\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u95f4\u5f3a\u534f\u8c03\u7684\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u9009\u9879\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u9009\u9879\u53d1\u73b0\u4e2d\u7684\u534f\u8c03\u6027\u6311\u6218"}}

We first introduce a corruption-aware training strategy to learns a spatiotemporal AOD prior solely from naturally incomplete data. Subsequently, we employ a decoupled annealing posterior sampling strategy that enables the more effective and integration of heterogeneous observations as constraints to guide the generation process. We validate the proposed framework through extensive experiments on Reanalysis data. Results across downscaling and inpainting tasks confirm the efficacy and robustness of AODDiff, specifically demonstrating its advantage in maintaining high spatial spectral fidelity.

Despite the progress in the field, making accurate forecasts remains challenging because real-world time series contain both global trends, local fine-grained structure, and features on multiple scales in between. Here, we present a new forecasting method, PRISM (Partitioned Representation for Iterative Sequence Modeling), that addresses this challenge through a learnable tree-based partitioning of the signal. At the root of the tree, a global representation captures coarse trends in the signal, while recursive splits reveal increasingly localized views of the signal. At each level of the tree, data are projected onto a time-frequency basis (e.g., wavelets or exponential moving averages) to extract scale-specific features, which are then aggregated across the hierarchy. This design allows the model to jointly capture global structure and local dynamics of the signal, enabling accurate forecasting. Experiments across benchmark datasets show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods for forecasting.

Integrating PH into machine learning and deep learning models enhances topology awareness and interpretability. However, most PH methods on graphs rely on a limited set of filtrations, such as degree-based or weight-based filtrations, which overlook richer features like recurring information across the dataset and thus restrict expressive power. In this work, we propose a novel graph filtration called Frequent Subgraph Filtration (FSF), which is derived from frequent subgraphs and produces stable and information-rich frequency-based persistent homology (FPH) features. We study the theoretical properties of FSF and provide both proofs and experimental validation. Beyond persistent homology itself, we introduce two approaches for graph classification: an FPH-based machine learning model (FPH-ML) and a hybrid framework that integrates FPH with graph neural networks (FPH-GNNs) to enhance topology-aware graph representation learning. Our frameworks bridge frequent subgraph mining and topological data analysis, offering a new perspective on topology-aware feature extraction. Experimental results show that FPH-ML achieves competitive or superior accuracy compared with kernel-based and degree-based filtration methods. When integrated into graph neural networks, FPH yields relative performance gains ranging from 0.4 to 21 percent, with improvements of up to 8.2 percentage points over GCN and GIN backbones across benchmarks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u9891\u7e41\u5b50\u56fe\u7684\u56fe\u8fc7\u6ee4\u65b9\u6cd5FSF\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u9891\u7387\u6301\u4e45\u540c\u8c03\u7279\u5f81FPH\uff0c\u5e76\u5f00\u53d1FPH-ML\u548cFPH-GNN\u4e24\u79cd\u56fe\u5206\u7c7b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u62d3\u6251\u611f\u77e5\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u56fe\u6301\u4e45\u540c\u8c03\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3b\u8981\u4f9d\u8d56\u5ea6\u6216\u6743\u91cd\u7b49\u6709\u9650\u8fc7\u6ee4\u65b9\u5f0f\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e2d\u91cd\u590d\u51fa\u73b0\u7684\u4e30\u5bcc\u62d3\u6251\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u9891\u7e41\u5b50\u56fe\u8fc7\u6ee4FSF\uff0c\u4ece\u9891\u7e41\u5b50\u56fe\u751f\u6210\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u9891\u7387\u6301\u4e45\u540c\u8c03\u7279\u5f81FPH\uff1b\u5f00\u53d1FPH-ML\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u548cFPH-GNN\u56fe\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u6df7\u5408\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "result": "FPH-ML\u5728\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u6838\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u5ea6\u8fc7\u6ee4\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1bFPH-GNN\u76f8\u6bd4GCN\u548cGIN\u57fa\u7ebf\u83b7\u5f970.4-21%\u76f8\u5bf9\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u6700\u9ad8\u63d0\u53478.2\u4e2a\u767e\u5206\u70b9\u3002", "conclusion": "FSF\u548cFPH\u6846\u67b6\u8fde\u63a5\u4e86\u9891\u7e41\u5b50\u56fe\u6316\u6398\u548c\u62d3\u6251\u6570\u636e\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u4e3a\u62d3\u6251\u611f\u77e5\u7279\u5f81\u63d0\u53d6\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u89c6\u89d2\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u56fe\u8868\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

By introducing Exponential Stability Labels (ESL) and a $\u03bb$-weighted aggregation mechanism, the framework effectively balances the bias-variance trade-off in multi-step learning. Policy optimization is guided by a stability-aware advantage function, ensuring the learned policy promotes rapid Lyapunov descent. We evaluate MSACL across six benchmarks, including stabilization and nonlinear tracking tasks, demonstrating its superiority over state-of-the-art Lyapunov-based RL algorithms. MSACL achieves exponential stability and rapid convergence under simple rewards, while exhibiting significant robustness to uncertainties and generalization to unseen trajectories. Sensitivity analysis establishes the multi-step horizon $n=20$ as a robust default across diverse systems.

In practice, learned features are often redundant and vary across training runs and sparsity levels, which makes interpretations difficult to transfer and reuse. We introduce Distilled Matryoshka Sparse Autoencoders (DMSAEs), a training pipeline that distills a compact core of consistently useful features and reuses it to train new SAEs. DMSAEs run an iterative distillation cycle: train a Matryoshka SAE with a shared core, use gradient X activation to measure each feature's contribution to next-token loss in the most nested reconstruction, and keep only the smallest subset that explains a fixed fraction of the attribution. Only the core encoder weight vectors are transferred across cycles; the core decoder and all non-core latents are reinitialized each time. On Gemma-2-2B layer 12 residual stream activations, seven cycles of distillation (500M tokens, 65k width) yielded a distilled core of 197 features that were repeatedly selected. Training using this distilled core improves several SAEBench metrics and demonstrates that consistent sets of latent features can be transferred across sparsity levels", "AI": {"tldr": "DMSAEs\u901a\u8fc7\u84b8\u998f\u5faa\u73af\u63d0\u53d6\u6838\u5fc3\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u8de8\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u7a00\u758f\u5ea6\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7279\u5f81\u5b66\u4e60", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u7a00\u758f\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u5b58\u5728\u5197\u4f59\u6027\u3001\u8bad\u7ec3\u95f4\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u7a00\u758f\u5ea6\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u7279\u5f81\u89e3\u91ca\u96be\u4ee5\u8fc1\u79fb\u548c\u590d\u7528", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u84b8\u998f\u5d4c\u5957\u7a00\u758f\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff1a\u901a\u8fc7\u8fed\u4ee3\u84b8\u998f\u5faa\u73af\u8bad\u7ec3\u5171\u4eab\u6838\u5fc3\u7684Matryoshka SAE\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u68af\u5ea6\u6fc0\u6d3b\u5f52\u56e0\u8bc4\u4f30\u7279\u5f81\u8d21\u732e\uff0c\u4fdd\u7559\u89e3\u91ca\u56fa\u5b9a\u6bd4\u4f8b\u5f52\u56e0\u7684\u6700\u5c0f\u7279\u5f81\u5b50\u96c6", "result": "\u5728Gemma-2-2B\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\uff0c7\u8f6e\u84b8\u998f\u5f97\u5230197\u4e2a\u6838\u5fc3\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u8be5\u6838\u5fc3\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u65b0SAE\u5728\u591a\u4e2aSAEBench\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u63d0\u5347", "conclusion": "DMSAEs\u80fd\u591f\u63d0\u53d6\u8de8\u7a00\u758f\u5ea6\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u6838\u5fc3\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u7a00\u758f\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u53ef\u8fc1\u79fb\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u590d\u7528\u6027"}}

However, a task's data efficiency--i.e., the number of fine-tuning examples needed to achieve a desired level of performance--is often unknown, resulting in costly cycles of incremental annotation and retraining. Indeed, we demonstrate across a curated set of 30 specialized tasks that performant LLMs may struggle zero-shot but can attain stronger performance after fine-tuning. This motivates the need for methods to predict a task's data efficiency without requiring incremental annotation. After introducing a concrete metric that quantifies a task's data efficiency, we propose using the gradient cosine similarity of low-confidence examples to predict data efficiency based on a small number of labeled samples. We validate our approach on a diverse set of tasks with varying data efficiencies, attaining 8.6% error in overall data efficiency prediction and typically eliminating hundreds of unnecessary annotations on each task.

Consequently, whenever a target distribution can be generated using a small number of sequential steps, a DLM can be used to generate the distribution using the same number of optimal sequential steps. However, without the ability to modify previously revealed tokens, DLMs with CoT can still incur large intermediate footprints. We prove that enabling remasking (converting unmasked tokens to masks) or revision (converting unmasked tokens to other unmasked tokens) together with CoT further allows DLMs to simulate any parallel sampling algorithm with optimal space complexity. We further justify the advantage of revision by establishing a strict expressivity gap: DLMs with revision or remasking are strictly more expressive than those without.

Strength is crucial for decision-making under uncertainty and generalization of preference models, but hard to measure reliably. Metadata such as response times and inter-annotator agreement can serve as proxies for strength, but are often noisy and confounded. We propose ResponseRank to address the challenge of learning from noisy strength signals. Our method uses relative differences in proxy signals to rank responses to pairwise comparisons by their inferred preference strength. To control for systemic variation, we compare signals only locally within carefully constructed strata. This enables robust learning of utility differences consistent with strength-derived rankings while making minimal assumptions about the strength signal. Our contributions are threefold: (1) ResponseRank, a novel method that robustly learns preference strength by leveraging locally valid relative strength signals; (2) empirical evidence of improved sample efficiency and robustness across diverse tasks: synthetic preference learning (with simulated response times), language modeling (with annotator agreement), and RL control tasks (with simulated episode returns); and (3) the Pearson Distance Correlation (PDC), a novel metric that isolates cardinal utility learning from ordinal accuracy.", "AI": {"tldr": "ResponseRank\uff1a\u5229\u7528\u76f8\u5bf9\u5f3a\u5ea6\u4fe1\u53f7\uff08\u5982\u54cd\u5e94\u65f6\u95f4\u3001\u6807\u6ce8\u8005\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff09\u6765\u5b66\u4e60\u504f\u597d\u5f3a\u5ea6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c40\u90e8\u5206\u5c42\u6bd4\u8f83\u63a7\u5236\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u53d8\u5f02\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u6837\u672c\u6548\u7387\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edfRLHF\u4e2d\u7684\u4e8c\u5143\u9009\u62e9\u53ea\u80fd\u4f20\u8fbe\u504f\u597d\u65b9\u5411\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u8861\u91cf\u504f\u597d\u5f3a\u5ea6\u3002\u5f3a\u5ea6\u4fe1\u606f\u5bf9\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u51b3\u7b56\u548c\u504f\u597d\u6a21\u578b\u6cdb\u5316\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u96be\u4ee5\u53ef\u9760\u6d4b\u91cf\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u4ee3\u7406\u4fe1\u53f7\uff08\u5982\u54cd\u5e94\u65f6\u95f4\u3001\u6807\u6ce8\u8005\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff09\u901a\u5e38\u566a\u58f0\u5927\u4e14\u5b58\u5728\u6df7\u6dc6\u56e0\u7d20\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faResponseRank\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a\u5229\u7528\u4ee3\u7406\u4fe1\u53f7\u7684\u76f8\u5bf9\u5dee\u5f02\u6765\u5bf9\u6210\u5bf9\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e2d\u7684\u54cd\u5e94\u6309\u63a8\u65ad\u7684\u504f\u597d\u5f3a\u5ea6\u6392\u5e8f\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u7cbe\u5fc3\u6784\u5efa\u7684\u5206\u5c42\u8fdb\u884c\u5c40\u90e8\u6bd4\u8f83\uff0c\u63a7\u5236\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u53d8\u5f02\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9\u5f3a\u5ea6\u4fe1\u53f7\u505a\u6700\u5c0f\u5047\u8bbe\uff0c\u80fd\u9c81\u68d2\u5730\u5b66\u4e60\u4e0e\u5f3a\u5ea6\u6392\u5e8f\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u6548\u7528\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff1a\u5408\u6210\u504f\u597d\u5b66\u4e60\uff08\u6a21\u62df\u54cd\u5e94\u65f6\u95f4\uff09\u3001\u8bed\u8a00\u5efa\u6a21\uff08\u6807\u6ce8\u8005\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff09\u3001RL\u63a7\u5236\u4efb\u52a1\uff08\u6a21\u62df\u56de\u5408\u56de\u62a5\uff09\u3002\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u6837\u672c\u6548\u7387\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002\u8fd8\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86Pearson\u8ddd\u79bb\u76f8\u5173\u6027\uff08PDC\uff09\u8fd9\u4e00\u65b0\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u4ece\u5e8f\u6570\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e2d\u5206\u79bb\u57fa\u6570\u6548\u7528\u5b66\u4e60\u3002", "conclusion": "ResponseRank\u80fd\u591f\u4ece\u566a\u58f0\u5f3a\u5ea6\u4fe1\u53f7\u4e2d\u9c81\u68d2\u5730\u5b66\u4e60\u504f\u597d\u5f3a\u5ea6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c40\u90e8\u76f8\u5bf9\u6bd4\u8f83\u63a7\u5236\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u53d8\u5f02\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u6539\u8fdb\u7684\u6837\u672c\u6548\u7387\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u504f\u597d\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u5f3a\u5ea6\u4fe1\u606f\u3002"}}

Code: https://github.com/alexlioralexli/generative-classifiers", "summary": "Discriminative approaches to classification often learn shortcuts that hold in-distribution but fail even under minor distribution shift. This failure mode stems from an overreliance on features that are spuriously correlated with the label. We show that generative classifiers, which use class-conditional generative models, can avoid this issue by modeling all features, both core and spurious, instead of mainly spurious ones. These generative classifiers are simple to train, avoiding the need for specialized augmentations, strong regularization, extra hyperparameters, or knowledge of the specific spurious correlations to avoid. We find that diffusion-based and autoregressive generative classifiers achieve state-of-the-art performance on five standard image and text distribution shift benchmarks and reduce the impact of spurious correlations in realistic applications, such as medical or satellite datasets. Finally, we carefully analyze a Gaussian toy setting to understand the inductive biases of generative classifiers, as well as the data properties that determine when generative classifiers outperform discriminative ones.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u901a\u8fc7\u5efa\u6a21\u6240\u6709\u7279\u5f81\uff08\u5305\u62ec\u6838\u5fc3\u548c\u865a\u5047\u7279\u5f81\uff09\u6765\u907f\u514d\u5224\u522b\u5f0f\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u5bf9\u865a\u5047\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u7684\u8fc7\u5ea6\u4f9d\u8d56\uff0c\u5728\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u79fb\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u9c81\u68d2", "motivation": "\u5224\u522b\u5f0f\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u5206\u5e03\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e60\u6377\u5f84\uff08\u865a\u5047\u76f8\u5173\u6027\uff09\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u79fb\u4e0b\u5bb9\u6613\u5931\u8d25\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u907f\u514d\u8fc7\u5ea6\u4f9d\u8d56\u865a\u5047\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u7c7b\u6761\u4ef6\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u5982\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u6a21\u578b\uff09\u7684\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\uff0c\u5efa\u6a21\u6240\u6709\u7279\u5f81\u800c\u975e\u4e3b\u8981\u5efa\u6a21\u865a\u5047\u7279\u5f81\u3002\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b80\u5355\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u7279\u6b8a\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u3001\u5f3a\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u6216\u989d\u5916\u8d85\u53c2\u6570", "result": "\u5728\u4e94\u4e2a\u6807\u51c6\u56fe\u50cf\u548c\u6587\u672c\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u79fb\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8fbe\u5230\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5728\u533b\u7597\u548c\u536b\u661f\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7b49\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u51cf\u5c11\u865a\u5047\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u9ad8\u65af\u73a9\u5177\u8bbe\u7f6e\u5206\u6790\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u7684\u5f52\u7eb3\u504f\u7f6e", "conclusion": "\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u901a\u8fc7\u5efa\u6a21\u6240\u6709\u7279\u5f81\u800c\u975e\u4e3b\u8981\u5efa\u6a21\u865a\u5047\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u907f\u514d\u5224\u522b\u5f0f\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u5728\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u79fb\u4e0b\u7684\u5931\u8d25\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\u6027\u80fd"}}

Instead, we identify all of the neurons corresponding to each learned representation and then study the collective group of neurons as one entity.

Motivated by the idea that intelligence emerge from many minds, we propose Population Bayesian Transformers (B-Trans), which transform a standard Large Language Model into a Bayesian Transformer model to supports sampling diverse yet coherent model instances from a single set of pre-trained weights.\n  B-Trans introduces a Bayesian-motivated posterior proxy by treating the bias-like offsets in normalization layers as stochastic variables with a Gaussian variational approximation, inducing a distribution over model behavior without the cost of training full Bayesian neural networks. Sampling from this proxy yields a set of model instances with diverse behaviors while maintaining general competence. To preserve coherence within each generation, we freeze the sampled noise at the sequence level, enforcing temporal consistency across tokens. B-Trans allows for population-level decision-making, where aggregating predictions across sampled individuals significantly enhances exploration. Experiments across zero-shot generation, Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR), and RL without explicit labels demonstrate that B-Trans effectively leverage the wisdom of crowds, yielding superior semantic diversity while achieving better task performance compared to deterministic baselines.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faB-Trans\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c06\u6807\u51c6\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u8d1d\u53f6\u65afTransformer\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u5c42\u4e2d\u7684\u504f\u7f6e\u504f\u79fb\u4f5c\u4e3a\u968f\u673a\u53d8\u91cf\uff0c\u4ece\u5355\u4e00\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6743\u91cd\u4e2d\u91c7\u6837\u51fa\u591a\u6837\u4e14\u8fde\u8d2f\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u5b9e\u4f8b\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u7fa4\u4f53\u667a\u80fd\u51b3\u7b56\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u4ee3Transformer\u901a\u5e38\u88ab\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e3a\u5355\u4e00\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u4f46\u667a\u80fd\u53ef\u80fd\u6e90\u4e8e\u591a\u4e2a\u5fc3\u667a\u7684\u96c6\u5408\u3002\u53d7\u6b64\u542f\u53d1\uff0c\u5e0c\u671b\u4ece\u5355\u4e00\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6743\u91cd\u4e2d\u751f\u6210\u5177\u6709\u591a\u6837\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u5b9e\u4f8b\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u7fa4\u4f53\u51b3\u7b56\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u5c42\u4e2d\u7684\u504f\u7f6e\u504f\u79fb\u89c6\u4e3a\u968f\u673a\u53d8\u91cf\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u9ad8\u65af\u53d8\u5206\u8fd1\u4f3c\u6784\u5efa\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u540e\u9a8c\u4ee3\u7406\u3002\u5728\u5e8f\u5217\u7ea7\u522b\u51bb\u7ed3\u91c7\u6837\u566a\u58f0\u4ee5\u786e\u4fdd\u65f6\u95f4\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u4ece\u5355\u4e00\u6743\u91cd\u96c6\u91c7\u6837\u4ea7\u751f\u591a\u6837\u5316\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u5b9e\u4f8b\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u751f\u6210\u3001\u5e26\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5956\u52b1\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60(RLVR)\u548c\u65e0\u663e\u5f0f\u6807\u7b7e\u7684RL\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0cB-Trans\u901a\u8fc7\u805a\u5408\u591a\u4e2a\u91c7\u6837\u4e2a\u4f53\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u8bed\u4e49\u591a\u6837\u6027\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u83b7\u5f97\u4e86\u6bd4\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u57fa\u7ebf\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "B-Trans\u6210\u529f\u5c06\u6807\u51c6LLM\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u8d1d\u53f6\u65afTransformer\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4ece\u5355\u4e00\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6743\u91cd\u4e2d\u91c7\u6837\u591a\u6837\u5316\u6a21\u578b\u5b9e\u4f8b\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u7fa4\u4f53\u51b3\u7b56\u5728\u63d0\u5347\u8bed\u4e49\u591a\u6837\u6027\u548c\u4efb\u52a1\u6027\u80fd\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002"}}

In this work, we train language models to make predictions on open-ended forecasting questions. To scale up training data, we synthesize novel forecasting questions from global events reported in daily news, using a fully automated, careful curation recipe. We train the Qwen3 thinking models on our dataset, OpenForesight. To prevent leakage of future information during training and evaluation, we use an offline news corpus, both for data generation and retrieval in our forecasting system. Guided by a small validation set, we show the benefits of retrieval, and an improved reward function for reinforcement learning (RL). Once we obtain our final forecasting system, we perform held-out testing between May to August 2025. Our specialized model, OpenForecaster 8B, matches much larger proprietary models, with our training improving the accuracy, calibration, and consistency of predictions. We find calibration improvements from forecasting training generalize across popular benchmarks. We open-source all our models, code, and data to make research on language model forecasting broadly accessible.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bad\u7ec3\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u5f00\u653e\u5f0f\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u65b0\u95fb\u751f\u6210\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1OpenForecaster 8B\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5728\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3001\u6821\u51c6\u548c\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u5ab2\u7f8e\u66f4\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u7684\u4e13\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "motivation": "\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u51b3\u7b56\u9700\u8981\u5728\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4e0b\u5bf9\u672a\u6765\u8fdb\u884c\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u80fd\u591f\u8fdb\u884c\u5f00\u653e\u5f0f\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4f46\u76ee\u524d\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u548c\u9632\u6b62\u672a\u6765\u4fe1\u606f\u6cc4\u9732\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "method": "1. \u4ece\u6bcf\u65e5\u65b0\u95fb\u4e2d\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u5408\u6210\u9884\u6d4b\u95ee\u9898\uff1b2. \u4f7f\u7528\u79bb\u7ebf\u65b0\u95fb\u8bed\u6599\u9632\u6b62\u4fe1\u606f\u6cc4\u9732\uff1b3. \u8bad\u7ec3Qwen3\u601d\u8003\u6a21\u578b\uff1b4. \u7ed3\u5408\u68c0\u7d22\u673a\u5236\u548c\u6539\u8fdb\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u5956\u52b1\u51fd\u6570\uff1b5. \u57282025\u5e745-8\u6708\u8fdb\u884c\u4fdd\u7559\u6d4b\u8bd5\u3002", "result": "OpenForecaster 8B\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3001\u6821\u51c6\u548c\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5339\u914d\u66f4\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u7684\u4e13\u6709\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4e14\u9884\u6d4b\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u6821\u51c6\u6539\u8fdb\u80fd\u591f\u6cdb\u5316\u5230\u5176\u4ed6\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u6570\u636e\u751f\u6210\u548c\u4e13\u95e8\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u5f00\u53d1\u51fa\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5f00\u6e90\u6a21\u578b\u3001\u4ee3\u7801\u548c\u6570\u636e\u5c06\u4fc3\u8fdb\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u6d4b\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u53ef\u53ca\u6027\u3002"}}
