ASIPs are often derived from off-the-shelf\nGPPs extended by custom instructions tailored towards a specific software\nworkload. One of the most important challenges of designing an ASIP is to find\nsaid custom instructions that help to increase performance without being too\ncostly in terms of area and power consumption. To date, solving this challenge\nis relatively labor-intensive and typically performed manually. Addressing the\nlack of automation, we present Custom Instruction Designer for RISC-V\nExtensions (CIDRE), a front-to-back tool for ASIP design. CIDRE automatically\nanalyzes hotspots in RISC-V applications and generates custom instruction\nsuggestions with a corresponding nML description. The nML description can be\nused with other electronic design automation tools to accurately assess the\ncost and benefits of the found suggestions. In a RISC-V benchmark study, we\nwere able to accelerate embedded benchmarks from Embench and MiBench by up to\n2.47x with less than 24% area increase.

Despite\ninstitutional support, many DE initiatives underperform or fail to realize\ntheir intended benefits. We argue that this often results from a limited\nunderstanding of the social and technical barriers, and particularly how their\ninterplay shapes transformation outcomes. To address this gap, we document\nbarriers identified in the literature and grounded in sociotechnical systems\ntheory, organized into six dimensions: people, processes, culture, goals,\ninfrastructure, and technology. We then map these barriers to the U.S.\nDepartment of Defense's DE policy goals. Our analysis shows that technological\ninvestments alone are insufficient, as failures frequently arise from social\nfactors such as workforce readiness, leadership support, and cultural\nalignment. The mapping also demonstrates that sociotechnical barriers often\ncascade across dimensions, making their impact on policy goals difficult to\ntrace and complicating implementation. These insights carry practical\nimplications: managers may use the mapping as a diagnostic tool to identify\nrisks and prioritize resources; policymakers may complement strategic mandates\nwith sustained investments and long-term change management; and engineers may\nview DE not as a threat to job security but as an opportunity for more\neffective collaboration."}

Traditional unlearning approaches,\nincluding retraining, activation editing, or distillation, are often\ncomputationally expensive, fragile, and ill-suited for real-time or\ncontinuously evolving systems. In this paper, we propose a paradigm shift:\nrethinking unlearning not as a retroactive intervention but as a built-in\ncapability.

Rather than\nencoding information in model weights, our approach binds class-level semantics\nto dedicated prompt tokens. This design enables instant unlearning simply by\nremoving the corresponding prompt -- without retraining, model modification, or\naccess to original data. Experiments demonstrate that our framework preserves\npredictive performance on retained classes while effectively erasing forgotten\nones. Beyond utility, our method exhibits strong privacy and security\nguarantees: it is resistant to membership inference attacks, and prompt removal\nprevents any residual knowledge extraction, even under adversarial conditions.\nThis ensures compliance with data protection principles and safeguards against\nunauthorized access to forgotten information, making the framework suitable for\ndeployment in sensitive and regulated environments.

Recent protocols such as Partially-Synchronous Bullshark and Sailfish\ncombine elements of both approaches by using a DAG to enable parallel data\ndissemination and a leader that paces DAG formation. This improves latency\nwhile achieving state-of-the-art throughput. Yet the latency of leader-based\nprotocols is still better under moderate loads.\n  We present Angelfish, a hybrid protocol that adapts smoothly across this\ndesign space, from leader-based to Sailfish-like DAG-based consensus.

Online Decision Transformers (ODTs) address this limitation\nthrough entropy-regularized training on on-policy rollouts, offering a stable\nalternative to traditional RL methods like Soft Actor-Critic, which depend on\nbootstrapped targets and reward shaping. Despite these advantages, ODTs use\nstandard attention, which lacks explicit memory of action-specific outcomes.\nThis leads to inefficiencies in learning long-term action effectiveness.\nInspired by cognitive models such as Experience-Weighted Attraction (EWA), we\npropose Experience-Weighted Attraction with Vector Quantization for Online\nDecision Transformers (EWA-VQ-ODT), a lightweight module that maintains\nper-action mental accounts summarizing recent successes and failures.\nContinuous actions are routed via direct grid lookup to a compact\nvector-quantized codebook, where each code stores a scalar attraction updated\nonline through decay and reward-based reinforcement. These attractions modulate\nattention by biasing the columns associated with action tokens, requiring no\nchange to the backbone or training objective. On standard continuous-control\nbenchmarks, EWA-VQ-ODT improves sample efficiency and average return over ODT,\nparticularly in early training. The module is computationally efficient,\ninterpretable via per-code traces, and supported by theoretical guarantees that\nbound the attraction dynamics and its impact on attention drift."}

We introduce Latent Zoning Network (LZN)\nas a step toward this goal. At its core, LZN creates a shared Gaussian latent\nspace that encodes information across all tasks. Each data type (e.g., images,\ntext, labels) is equipped with an encoder that maps samples to disjoint latent\nzones, and a decoder that maps latents back to data. ML tasks are expressed as\ncompositions of these encoders and decoders: for example, label-conditional\nimage generation uses a label encoder and image decoder; image embedding uses\nan image encoder; classification uses an image encoder and label decoder. We\ndemonstrate the promise of LZN in three increasingly complex scenarios: (1) LZN\ncan enhance existing models (image generation): When combined with the SoTA\nRectified Flow model, LZN improves FID on CIFAR10 from 2.76 to 2.59-without\nmodifying the training objective.

These models\ntypically undergo meticulous alignment procedures involving human feedback to\nensure the acceptance of safe inputs while rejecting harmful or unsafe ones.\nHowever, despite their massive scale and alignment efforts, LLMs remain\nvulnerable to jailbreak attacks, where malicious users manipulate the model to\nproduce harmful outputs that it was explicitly trained to avoid. In this study,\nwe find that the safety mechanisms in LLMs are predominantly embedded in the\nmiddle-to-late layers. Building on this insight, we introduce a novel white-box\njailbreak method, SABER (Safety Alignment Bypass via Extra Residuals), which\nconnects two intermediate layers $s$ and $e$ such that $s < e$, through a\nresidual connection. Our approach achieves a 51% improvement over the\nbest-performing baseline on the HarmBench test set. Furthermore, SABER induces\nonly a marginal shift in perplexity when evaluated on the HarmBench validation\nset. The source code is publicly available at\nhttps://github.com/PalGitts/SABER."}

This paper introduces G-WindCast, a\nnovel deep learning framework that leverages signal strength variations from 5G\nGlobal Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) signals to retrieve and forecast\nthree-dimensional (3D) atmospheric wind fields. The framework utilizes Forward\nNeural Networks (FNN) and Transformer networks to capture complex, nonlinear,\nand spatiotemporal relationships between GNSS-derived features and wind\ndynamics. Our preliminary results demonstrate promising accuracy in both wind\nretrieval and short-term wind forecasting (up to 30 minutes lead time), with\nskill scores comparable to high-resolution NWP outputs in certain scenarios.\nThe model exhibits robustness across different forecast horizons and pressure\nlevels, and its predictions for wind speed and direction show superior\nagreement with observations compared to concurrent ERA5 reanalysis data.\nFurthermore, we show that the system can maintain excellent performance for\nlocalized forecasting even with a significantly reduced number of GNSS stations\n(e.g., around 100), highlighting its cost-effectiveness and scalability.
