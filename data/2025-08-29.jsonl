Multi-walled\nCarbon Nanotube (MWCNT) serves as a promising candidate for Cu interconnects\nthanks to the superior conductivity. Moreover, Carbon Nanotube Field Transistor\n(CNFET) also emerges as a prospective alternative to the conventional CMOS\ndevice because of high power efficiency and large noise margin. The combination\nof MWCNT and CNFET enables the promising CNT-based FPGAs. However, the MWCNT\ninterconnects exhibit significant process variations due to immature\nfabrication process, leading to delay faults. Also, the non-ideal CNFET\nfabrication process may generate a few metallic CNTs (m-CNTs), rendering\ncorrelated faulty blocks. In this article, we propose a ring oscillator (RO)\nbased testing technique to detect delay faults due to the process variation of\nMWCNT interconnects. Furthermore, we propose an effective testing technique for\nthe carry chains in CLBs, and an improved circuit design based on the lookup\ntable (LUT) is applied to speed up the fault testing of CNT-based FPGAs. In\naddition, we propose a testing algorithm to detect m-CNTs in CLBs. Finally, we\npropose a redundant spare row sharing architecture to improve the yield of\nCNT-based FPGA further. Experimental results show that the test time for a\n6-input LUT can be reduced by 35.49% compared with conventional testing, and\nthe proposed algorithm can achieve a high test coverage with little overhead.\nThe proposed redundant architecture can repair the faulty segment effectively\nand efficiently."}

This study proposes a novel Time-Varying Hybrid\nStochastic Gradient Tracking algorithm named TV-HSGT, based on hybrid\nstochastic gradient tracking and variance reduction mechanisms. Specifically,\nTV-HSGT integrates row-stochastic and column-stochastic communication schemes\nover time-varying digraphs, eliminating the need for Perron vector estimation\nor out-degree information. By combining current and recursive stochastic\ngradients, it effectively reduces gradient variance while accurately tracking\nglobal descent directions. Theoretical analysis demonstrates that TV-HSGT can\nachieve improved bounds on dynamic regret without assuming gradient\nboundedness. Experimental results on logistic regression tasks confirm the\neffectiveness of TV-HSGT in dynamic and resource-constrained environments."}

We address this gap by analyzing the convergence of\nSNGD and its accelerated variant, SPRING, for idealized parametric optimization\nproblems where the model is linear and the loss function is strongly convex and\nquadratic. In the special case of a least-squares loss, namely the standard\nlinear least-squares problem, we prove that SNGD is equivalent to a regularized\nKaczmarz method while SPRING is equivalent to an accelerated regularized\nKaczmarz method. As a result, by leveraging existing analyses we obtain under\nmild conditions (i) the first fast convergence rate for SNGD, (ii) the first\nconvergence guarantee for SPRING in any setting, and (iii) the first proof that\nSPRING can accelerate SNGD. In the case of a general strongly convex quadratic\nloss, we extend the analysis of the regularized Kaczmarz method to obtain a\nfast convergence rate for SNGD under stronger conditions, providing the first\nexplanation for the effectiveness of SNGD outside of the least-squares setting.\nOverall, our results illustrate how tools from randomized linear algebra can\nshed new light on the interplay between subsampling and curvature-aware\noptimization strategies."}

We propose the design and optimization of a high-performance,\narea-and energy-efficient ReRAM-based hardware accelerator to achieve robust\nDNN inferencing in the presence of stochastic noise. We make two key technical\ncontributions. First, we propose a stochastic-noise-aware training method,\nreferred to as ReSNA, to improve the accuracy of DNN inferencing on ReRAM\ncrossbars with stochastic noise. Second, we propose an information-theoretic\nalgorithm, referred to as CF-MESMO, to identify the Pareto set of solutions to\ntrade-off multiple objectives, including inferencing accuracy, area overhead,\nexecution time, and energy consumption. The main challenge in this context is\nthat executing the ReSNA method to evaluate each candidate ReRAM design is\nprohibitive. To address this challenge, we utilize the continuous-fidelity\nevaluation of ReRAM designs associated with prohibitive high computation cost\nby varying the number of training epochs to trade-off accuracy and cost.\nCF-MESMO iteratively selects the candidate ReRAM design and fidelity pair that\nmaximizes the information gained per unit computation cost about the optimal\nPareto front. Our experiments on benchmark DNNs show that the proposed\nalgorithms efficiently uncover high-quality Pareto fronts. On average, ReSNA\nachieves 2.57% inferencing accuracy improvement for ResNet20 on the CIFAR-10\ndataset with respect to the baseline configuration. Moreover, CF-MESMO\nalgorithm achieves 90.91% reduction in computation cost compared to the popular\nmulti-objective optimization algorithm NSGA-II to reach the best solution from\nNSGA-II."}

However,\nensuring high-quality service for real-time edge systems is a significant\nchallenge due to the considerable computational demands and resource\nrequirements of these models. Existing strategies typically either offload\ntransformer computations to other devices or directly deploy compressed models\non individual edge devices. These strategies, however, result in either\nconsiderable communication overhead or suboptimal trade-offs between accuracy\nand efficiency. To tackle these challenges, we propose a collaborative\ninference system for general transformer models, termed CoFormer. The central\nidea behind CoFormer is to exploit the divisibility and integrability of\ntransformer. An off-the-shelf large transformer can be decomposed into multiple\nsmaller models for distributed inference, and their intermediate results are\naggregated to generate the final output. We formulate an optimization problem\nto minimize both inference latency and accuracy degradation under heterogeneous\nhardware constraints. DeBo algorithm is proposed to first solve the\noptimization problem to derive the decomposition policy, and then progressively\ncalibrate decomposed models to restore performance. We demonstrate the\ncapability to support a wide range of transformer models on heterogeneous edge\ndevices, achieving up to 3.1$\\times$ inference speedup with large transformer\nmodels. Notably, CoFormer enables the efficient inference of GPT2-XL with 1.6\nbillion parameters on edge devices, reducing memory requirements by 76.3\\%.\nCoFormer can also reduce energy consumption by approximately 40\\% while\nmaintaining satisfactory inference performance."}
