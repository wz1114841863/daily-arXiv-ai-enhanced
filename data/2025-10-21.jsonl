And\nthough it acts somewhat as a scaling accelerator, the vertical integration also\nposes new challenges to design and manufacturing technologies. The placement of\ncircuits, vias, and macros in the planes of a 3D stack must be co-designed\nacross layers (or must conform to new standards) so that, when assembled, they\nhave correct spatial correspondence. Each layer, although perhaps being a mere\nfunctional slice through a system (and we can slice the system in many\ndifferent ways), must be independently testable so that we can systematically\ntest and diagnose subsystems before and after final assembly. When those layers\nare assembled, they must come together in a way that enables a sensible yield\nand facilitates testing the finished product.

Despite\nits wide adoption, GRPO's gains are often inconsistent; for instance, a model\nmay show significant improvement in one reasoning domain, like mathematics, yet\nremain stagnant in another, such as medicine. This inconsistency raises a\ncritical question: under what conditions does GRPO improve reasoning and\ngeneralize out-of-distribution (OOD)? We investigate this from a data\ndistribution perspective. We first prove theoretically that GRPO is a\nconservative reweighting scheme, bounded by the base model's distribution and\nthus unable to discover completely novel solutions. We further validate this in\ncarefully designed controlled studies by training transformers from scratch,\nevaluating generalization across reasoning depth, input length, token\nrepresentation, and compositionality. Our results provide a principled\nexplanation for GRPO's boundaries: OOD improvement emerges only when the target\ntask aligns with the model's pretrained biases, while gains on in-distribution\n(ID) tasks diminish as performance saturates. This reframes GRPO not as a\nuniversal reasoning enhancer but as a tool that sharpens pretraining biases.\nOur findings motivate future development of algorithms that can expand a\nmodel's capabilities beyond its pretraining origin."}

Using the application graphs from GUIrilla\ncrawler, we construct and release GUIrilla-Task, a large-scale dataset of\n27,171 functionally grounded tasks across 1,108 macOS applications, each\nannotated with full-desktop and window-level screenshots, accessibility\nmetadata, and semantic action traces. Empirical results show that tuning\nLLM-based agents on GUIrilla-Task significantly improves performance on\ndownstream UI tasks, outperforming synthetic baselines on the ScreenSpot Pro\nbenchmark while using 97% less data. We also release macapptree, an open-source\nlibrary for reproducible collection of structured accessibility metadata, along\nwith the full GUIrilla-Task dataset, the manually verified GUIrilla-Gold\nbenchmark, and the framework code to support open research in desktop autonomy."}

In fact, each test\nenvironment highlights the benefit of a different aspect: the counterfactual\ntest emphasizes user satisfaction in the long-terms, while the factual test\nfocuses on predicting subsequent user behaviors on platforms.

The ideal goal is Retrain\nEquivalence--behavior identical to a model trained from scratch on only the\nretained data. This goal was formulated for models trained on i.i.d. data\nbatches, but modern pipelines often involve multi-stage training, with each\nstage having a distinct data distribution and objective. Examples include LLM\nfine-tuning for alignment, reasoning ability, etc. Our study shows via theory\nand experiments that this shift to multi-stage training introduces a\nfundamental barrier for machine unlearning. The theory indicates that the\noutcome of local unlearning--methods that only use gradients computed on the\nforget set--is path-dependent. That is, a model's behavior during unlearning is\ninfluenced by the order of its training stages during learning, making it\nimpossible for path-oblivious algorithms to universally achieve Retrain\nEquivalence. We empirically demonstrate the same phenomenon in LLM\npost-training across Llama and Qwen models (1B to 14B) with gradient ascent,\nNPO, and SimNPO local unlearning algorithms. Models fine-tuned via different\norderings of identical training stages diverge in behavior during unlearning,\nwith the degradation in GSM8K accuracy after unlearning varying by over 20%\nacross paths. We also observe that some learning paths consistently produce\nmodels that unlearn slowly. During unlearning, whether the probability mass\ngets squeezed into paraphrasing or alternative concepts is also path-dependent.\nThese results consistently show that Retrain Equivalence is an ill-posed target\nfor local unlearning algorithms, so long as the target models are trained in\nstages.

Our results show that\nprobabilistic downscaling approaches provide more realistic spatial uncertainty\nrepresentations compared to simpler stochastic methods, with each probabilistic\nmodel offering different strengths in terms of ensemble dispersion,\ndeterministic skill, and physical consistency. These findings establish\nprobabilistic downscaling as an effective enhancement to operational\nsub-seasonal wind forecasts for renewable energy planning and risk assessment."}

In such an environment, the model should be\nable to detect these novel samples from unseen classes and learn them after\nthey are labeled. We call this paradigm Autonomous Learning after Model\nDeployment (ALMD). The learning here is continuous and involves no human\nengineers. Labeling in this scenario is performed by human co-workers or other\nknowledgeable agents, which is similar to what humans do when they encounter an\nunfamiliar object and ask another person for its name. In ALMD, the detection\nof novel samples is dynamic and differs from traditional out-of-distribution\n(OOD) detection in that the set of in-distribution (ID) classes expands as new\nclasses are learned during application, whereas ID classes is fixed in\ntraditional OOD detection. Learning is also different from classic supervised\nlearning because in ALMD, we learn the encountered new classes immediately and\nincrementally. It is difficult to retrain the model from scratch using all the\npast data from the ID classes and the novel samples from newly discovered\nclasses, as this would be resource- and time-consuming. Apart from these two\nchallenges, ALMD faces the data scarcity issue because instances of new classes\noften appear sporadically in real-life applications.

Four inversion approaches applied to\nthree test samples with 4, 8, and 20 wells struggled to match these well data,\nespecially as the well number increased or as the test sample diverged from the\ntraining data. The key bottleneck lies in the GAN's latent representation: it\nis entangled, so samples with similar sedimentological features are not\nnecessarily close in the latent space. Label conditioning or latent\noverparameterization can partially disentangle the latent space during\ntraining, although not yet sufficiently for a successful inversion. Fine-tuning\nthe GAN to restructure the latent space locally reduces mismatches to\nacceptable levels for all test cases, with and without seismic data. But this\napproach depends on an initial, partially successful inversion step, which\ninfluences the quality and diversity of the final samples. Overall, GANs can\nalready handle the tasks required for their integration into geomodeling\nworkflows. We still need to further assess their robustness, and how to best\nleverage them in support of geological interpretation."}

For instance, an OVD model may struggle to distinguish\nbetween fine-grained classes such as \"fishing boat\" and \"yacht\" since their\nembeddings are similar and often inseparable. This can hamper specific user\ngoals, such as monitoring illegal fishing, by producing irrelevant detections.\nTo address this, we propose a cascaded approach that couples the broad\ngeneralization of a large pre-trained OVD model with a lightweight few-shot\nclassifier. Our method first employs the zero-shot model to generate\nhigh-recall object proposals.

We aim to replicate and\ncapture\n  the complex dynamics of industrial bioprocesses by proposing the use of a\nQuantum\n  Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Network with Gradient Penalty (QWGAN-GP)\nto\n  generate synthetic time series data for industrially relevant processes. The\n  generator within our GAN is comprised of a Parameterized Quantum Circuit\n(PQC). This\n  methodology offers potential advantages in process monitoring, modeling,\n  forecasting, and optimization, enabling more efficient bioprocess management\nby\n  reducing the dependence on scarce experimental data. Our results demonstrate\n  acceptable performance in capturing the temporal dynamics of real bioprocess\ndata.\n  We focus on Optical Density, a key measurement for Dry Biomass estimation.\nThe data\n  generated showed high fidelity to the actual historical experimental data.\nThis\n  intersection of quantum computing and machine learning has opened new\nfrontiers in\n  data analysis and generation, particularly in computationally intensive\nfields, for\n  use cases such as increasing prediction accuracy for soft sensor design or\nfor use\n  in predictive control."}
