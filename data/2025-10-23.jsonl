For\ninstance, the PAC-Bayes origin measure is regarded as one of the most reliable,\nand is indeed less sensitive to hyperparameter tweaks than many other measures.\nHowever, it completely fails to capture differences in data complexity across\nlearning curves. This data fragility contrasts with the function-based\nmarginal-likelihood PAC-Bayes bound, which does capture differences in\ndata-complexity, including scaling behavior, in learning curves, but which is\nnot a post-mortem measure.

Specifically, existing EP optimizations\nattempt to overlap data communication and computation, which has little benefit\nin low-bandwidth scenarios due to a much longer data communication time.\nTherefore, the trends of cross-DC EP scaling is fast becoming a critical\nroadblock to the continued growth of MoE models.\n  To address this, we propose HybridEP, a modeling-guided framework to optimize\nEP under constrained bandwidth. Our key idea is to dynamically transform the\nspatial placement of experts to reduce data communication traffic and\nfrequency, thereby minimizing EP's communication overheads.

Accurate estimation of these probabilities is key to\nunderstanding information diffusion processes and to improving the\neffectiveness of viral marketing strategies. However, learning these\nprobabilities from data is challenging; static data may capture correlations\nbetween peer recommendations and peer actions but fails to reveal influence\nrelationships. Online learning algorithms can learn these probabilities from\ninterventions but either waste resources by learning from random exploration or\noptimize for rewards, thus favoring exploration of the space with higher\ninfluence probabilities. In this work, we study learning peer influence\nprobabilities under a contextual linear bandit framework. We show that a\nfundamental trade-off can arise between regret minimization and estimation\nerror, characterize all achievable rate pairs, and propose an\nuncertainty-guided exploration algorithm that, by tuning a parameter, attains\nany pair within this trade-off.

Traditional Granger causality tests\nbased on linear models often fail to detect even mild non-linear causal\nrelationships. Therefore, numerous recent studies have investigated non-linear\nGranger causality methods, achieving improved performance. However, these\nmethods often rely on two key assumptions: causal sufficiency and known\ninterventional targets. Causal sufficiency assumes the absence of latent\nconfounders, yet their presence can introduce spurious correlations. Moreover,\nreal-world time series data usually come from heterogeneous environments,\nwithout prior knowledge of interventions. Therefore, in practice, it is\ndifficult to distinguish intervened environments from non-intervened ones, and\neven harder to identify which variables or timesteps are affected.

When monitoring such systems by means of sensors, one\noften assumes that some form of `age' is latently present in the data, but\nperhaps the available sensors do not readily provide this useful information.\nThe task that we study in this paper is to extract potential proxies for this\n`age' from the available multi-variate time series without having clear data on\nwhat `age' actually is. We argue that when we find a sensor, or more likely\nsome discovered function of the available sensors, that is sufficiently\nmonotonic, that function can act as the proxy we are searching for. Using a\ncarefully defined grammar and optimising the resulting equations in terms of\nmonotonicity, defined as the absolute Spearman's Rank Correlation between time\nand the candidate formula, the proposed approach generates a set of candidate\nfeatures which are then fitted and assessed on monotonicity. The proposed\nsystem is evaluated against an artificially generated dataset and two\nreal-world datasets. In all experiments, we show that the system is able to\ncombine sensors with low individual monotonicity into latent features with high\nmonotonicity.

However, the rapidly growing scale outpaces model training on a single\nDC, driving a shift toward a more flexible, cross-DC training paradigm. Under\nthis, Expert Parallelism (EP) of MoE faces significant scalability issues due\nto the limited cross-DC bandwidth. Specifically, existing EP optimizations\nattempt to overlap data communication and computation, which has little benefit\nin low-bandwidth scenarios due to a much longer data communication time.\nTherefore, the trends of cross-DC EP scaling is fast becoming a critical\nroadblock to the continued growth of MoE models.\n  To address this, we propose HybridEP, a modeling-guided framework to optimize\nEP under constrained bandwidth. Our key idea is to dynamically transform the\nspatial placement of experts to reduce data communication traffic and\nfrequency, thereby minimizing EP's communication overheads. However, it is\nnon-trivial to find the optimal solution because it complicates the original\ncommunication pattern by mixing data and expert communication. We therefore\nbuild a stream-based model to determine the optimal transmission ratio. Guided\nby this, we incorporate two techniques: (1) domain-based partition to construct\nthe mapping between hybrid patterns and specific communication topology at GPU\nlevel, and (2) parameter-efficient migration to further refine this topology by\nreducing expert transmission overhead and enlarging the domain size. Combining\nall these designs, HybridEP can be considered as a more general EP with better\nscalability. Experimental results show that HybridEP outperforms existing\nstate-of-the-art MoE training systems by up to 5.6x under constrained\nbandwidth. We further compare HybridEP and EP on large-scale simulations.\nHybridEP achieves up to 1.45x speedup with 1k DCs under different bandwidths."}

Accepted to IEEE BigData 2025", "summary": "Industrial and government organizations increasingly depend on data-driven\nanalytics for workforce, finance, and regulated decision processes, where\ntimeliness, cost efficiency, and compliance are critical. Distributed\nframeworks such as Spark and Flink remain effective for massive-scale batch or\nstreaming analytics but introduce coordination complexity and auditing\noverheads that misalign with moderate-scale, latency-sensitive inference.\nMeanwhile, cloud providers now offer serverless GPUs, and models such as TabNet\nenable interpretable tabular ML, motivating new deployment blueprints for\nregulated environments. In this paper, we present a production-oriented Big\nData as a Service (BDaaS) blueprint that integrates a single-node serverless\nGPU runtime with TabNet. The design leverages GPU acceleration for throughput,\nserverless elasticity for cost reduction, and feature-mask interpretability for\nIL4/FIPS compliance. We conduct benchmarks on the HR, Adult, and BLS datasets,\ncomparing our approach against Spark and CPU baselines. Our results show that\nGPU pipelines achieve up to 4.5x higher throughput, 98x lower latency, and 90%\nlower cost per 1K inferences compared to Spark baselines, while compliance\nmechanisms add only ~5.7 ms latency with p99 < 22 ms. Interpretability remains\nstable under peak load, ensuring reliable auditability. Taken together, these\nfindings provide a compliance-aware benchmark, a reproducible Helm-packaged\nblueprint, and a decision framework that demonstrate the practicality of\nsecure, interpretable, and cost-efficient serverless GPU analytics for\nregulated enterprise and government settings."}
