Altering a PCM cell's state during writes demands substantial\nenergy, posing a significant challenge to PCM's role as the primary main\nmemory. Prior research has explored methods to reduce write energy consumption,\nincluding the elimination of redundant writes, minimizing cell writes, and\nemploying compact row buffers for filtering PCM main memory accesses.

It targets a\ncycle-accurate dataflow simulator for microarchitectural analysis of fusion\nstrategies. We use FuseFlow for design-space exploration across four real-world\nmachine learning applications with sparsity, showing that full fusion (entire\ncross-expression fusion across all computation in an end-to-end model) is not\nalways optimal for sparse models-fusion granularity depends on the model\nitself.

We evaluate these strategies across diverse agentic benchmarks,\nincluding function calling and web navigation.

In this work, we systematically investigate\nthe performance of label-free RL methods across different model sizes and\nreasoning strengths, from 0.5B to 7B parameters. Our empirical analysis reveals\ncritical limitations: label-free RL is highly dependent on the base model's\npre-existing reasoning capability, with performance often degrading below\nbaseline levels for weaker models. We find that smaller models fail to generate\nsufficiently long or diverse chain-of-thought reasoning to enable effective\nself-reflection, and that training data difficulty plays a crucial role in\ndetermining success.

However, existing AI-based fault prediction models struggle to ensure\nreliability in evolving environments where they are required to adapt to new\nfault types and operational zones. In this paper, we propose a continual\nlearning (CL) framework in the smart grid context to evolve the model together\nwith the environment. We design four realistic evaluation scenarios grounded in\nclass-incremental and domain-incremental learning to emulate evolving grid\nconditions. We further introduce Prototype-based Dark Experience Replay\n(ProDER), a unified replay-based approach that integrates prototype-based\nfeature regularization, logit distillation, and a prototype-guided replay\nmemory. ProDER achieves the best performance among tested CL techniques, with\nonly a 0.045 accuracy drop for fault type prediction and 0.015 for fault zone\nprediction. These results demonstrate the practicality of CL for scalable,\nreal-world fault prediction in smart grids."}

However, existing models are typically trained for a single\nmaterial type and fail to generalize across distinct constitutive behaviors,\nlimiting their applicability in real-world engineering settings. Using granular\nflows as a running example, we propose a parameter-efficient conditioning\nmechanism that makes the GNS model adaptive to material parameters. We identify\nthat sensitivity to material properties is concentrated in the early\nmessage-passing (MP) layers, a finding we link to the local nature of\nconstitutive models (e.g., Mohr-Coulomb) and their effects on information\npropagation. We empirically validate this by showing that fine-tuning only the\nfirst few (1-5) of 10 MP layers of a pretrained model achieves comparable test\nperformance as compared to fine-tuning the entire network. Building on this\ninsight, we propose a parameter-efficient Feature-wise Linear Modulation (FiLM)\nconditioning mechanism designed to specifically target these early layers. This\napproach produces accurate long-term rollouts on unseen, interpolated, or\nmoderately extrapolated values (e.g., up to 2.5 degrees for friction angle and\n0.25 kPa for cohesion) when trained exclusively on as few as 12 short\nsimulation trajectories from new materials, representing a 5-fold data\nreduction compared to a baseline multi-task learning method.

Leveraging this\ncomplementary expertise by arbitrating existing TSFM outputs presents a\ncompelling strategy, yet this remains a largely unexplored area of research.
