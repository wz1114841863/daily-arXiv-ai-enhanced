Descriptor-based\ndirect memory access controllers (DMACs) allow such transfers to be executed by\ndecoupling memory transfers from processing units. Classical descriptor-based\nDMACs are inefficient when handling arbitrary transfers of small unit sizes.\nExcessive descriptor size and the serialized nature of processing descriptors\nemployed by the DMAC lead to large static overheads when setting up transfers.\nTo tackle this inefficiency, we propose a descriptor-based DMAC optimized to\nefficiently handle arbitrary transfers of small unit sizes. We implement a\nlightweight descriptor format in an AXI4-based DMAC. We further increase\nperformance by implementing a low-overhead speculative descriptor prefetching\nscheme without additional latency penalties in the case of a misprediction. Our\nDMAC is integrated into a 64-bit Linux-capable RISC-V SoC and emulated on a\nKintex FPGA to evaluate its performance. Compared to an off-the-shelf\ndescriptor-based DMAC IP, we achieve 1.66x less latency launching transfers,\nincrease bus utilization up to 2.5x in an ideal memory system with\n64-byte-length transfers while requiring 11% fewer lookup tables, 23% fewer\nflip-flops, and no block RAMs. We can extend our lead in bus utilization to\n3.6x with 64-byte-length transfers in deep memory systems. We synthesized our\nDMAC in GlobalFoundries' GF12LP+ node, achieving a clock frequency of over 1.44\nGHz while occupying only 49.5 kGE."}

This paper considers offloading most\nof such data structures from the costly host DRAM to secondary memory whose\nlatency is in the microsecond range, an order of magnitude longer than those of\ncurrently available DIMM-mounted or CXL memory devices. While emerging\nmicrosecond-latency memory is likely to cost much less than DRAM, it can\nsignificantly slow down SSD-based KV stores if naively employed.

Our analysis finds that a well-known latency-hiding\ntechnique of software prefetching for long-latency memory from user-level\nthreads is effective. The novelty of our analysis lies in modeling how the\ninterplay between prefetching and IO affects performance, from which we derive\nan equation that well explains the throughput degradation due to long memory\nlatency. The model tells us that the presence of IO significantly enhances the\ntolerance to memory latency, leading to a finding that SSD-based KV stores can\nbe made latency-tolerant without devising new techniques for\nmicrosecond-latency memory. To confirm this, we design a microbenchmark as well\nas modify existing SSD-based KV stores so that they issue prefetches from\nuser-level threads, and run them while placing most of in-memory data\nstructures on FPGA-based memory with adjustable microsecond latency. The\nresults demonstrate that their KV operation throughputs can be well explained\nby our model, and the modified KV stores achieve near-DRAM throughputs for up\nto a memory latency of 5 microseconds.

It also incorporates energy preservation\nconstraints for individual levels based on Parseval's theorem to preserve\nspectral fidelity throughout the diffusion process. Comprehensive tests across\nsix real-world datasets from energy, finance, and neuroscience domains\ndemonstrate that WaveletDiff consistently outperforms state-of-the-art\ntime-domain and frequency-domain generative methods on both short and long time\nseries across five diverse performance metrics. For example, WaveletDiff\nachieves discriminative scores and Context-FID scores that are $3\\times$\nsmaller on average than the second-best baseline across all datasets."}

The literature\ntypically distinguishes between two settings: infinite inventory, where the\nfirm has unlimited stock and time to sell, and finite inventory, where both\ninventory and selling horizon are limited. In both cases, the central challenge\nlies in the fact that the demand function -- how sales respond to price -- is\nunknown and must be learned from data. Traditional approaches often assume a\nspecific parametric form for the demand function, enabling the use of\nreinforcement learning (RL) to identify near-optimal pricing strategies.\nHowever, such assumptions may not hold in real-world scenarios, limiting the\napplicability of these methods. In this work, we propose a Gaussian Process\n(GP) based nonparametric approach to dynamic pricing that avoids restrictive\nmodeling assumptions. We treat the demand function as a black-box function of\nthe price and develop pricing algorithms based on Bayesian Optimization (BO) --\na sample-efficient method for optimizing unknown functions. We present BO-based\nalgorithms tailored for both infinite and finite inventory settings and provide\nregret guarantees for both regimes, thereby quantifying the learning efficiency\nof our methods.

Our\nanalysis introduces new resistance bounds for intra-cluster edges, a\nrank-$(n-k)$ effective resistance formulation, and a matrix Chernoff bound\nadapted to the dominant eigenspace. These tools allow us to bypass importance\nsampling entirely. Conceptually, our result connects recent coreset-based\nclustering theory to spectral sparsification, showing that under strong\nclusterability, even uniform sampling is structure-aware.

However, due\nto the heterogeneity of inter-variate dependencies and the backbone scalability\non large-scale multivariate datasets, most TSFMs are typically pre-trained on\nunivariate time series. This limitation renders them oblivious to crucial\ninformation from diverse covariates in real-world forecasting tasks. To further\nenhance the performance of TSFMs, we propose a general covariate-aware\nadaptation (CoRA) framework for TSFMs. It leverages pre-trained backbones of\nfoundation models while effectively incorporating exogenous covariates from\nvarious modalities, including time series, language, and images, to improve the\nquality of predictions. Technically, CoRA maintains the equivalence of\ninitialization and parameter consistency during adaptation. With preserved\nbackbones of foundation models as frozen feature extractors, the outcome\nembeddings from foundation models are empirically demonstrated more informative\nthan raw data. Further, CoRA employs a novel Granger Causality Embedding (GCE)\nto automatically evaluate covariates regarding their causal predictability with\nrespect to the target variate. We incorporate these weighted embeddings with a\nzero-initialized condition-injection mechanism, avoiding catastrophic\nforgetting of pre-trained foundation models and gradually integrates exogenous\ninformation. Extensive experiments show that CoRA of TSFMs surpasses\nstate-of-the-art covariate-aware deep forecasters with full or few-shot\ntraining samples, achieving 31.1% MSE reduction on covariate-aware forecasting.\nCompared to other adaptation methods, CoRA exhibits strong compatibility with\nvarious advanced TSFMs and extends the scope of covariates to other modalities,\npresenting a practical paradigm for the application of TSFMs."}
