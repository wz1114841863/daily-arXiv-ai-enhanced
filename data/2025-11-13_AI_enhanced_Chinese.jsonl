In this work we present, to the best of our knowledge, the first implementation of selective code offloading to FPGAs via the OpenMP target directive within MLIR. Our approach combines the MLIR OpenMP dialect with a High-Level Synthesis (HLS) dialect to provide a portable compilation flow targeting FPGAs. Unlike prior OpenMP FPGA efforts that rely on custom compilers, by contrast we integrate with MLIR and so support any MLIR-compatible front end, demonstrated here with Flang. Building upon a range of existing MLIR building blocks significantly reduces the effort required and demonstrates the composability benefits of the MLIR ecosystem. Our approach supports manual optimisation of offloaded kernels through standard OpenMP directives, and this work establishes a flexible and extensible path for directive-based FPGA acceleration integrated within the MLIR ecosystem.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u9996\u6b21\u5728MLIR\u4e2d\u901a\u8fc7OpenMP\u76ee\u6807\u6307\u4ee4\u5b9e\u73b0\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u4ee3\u7801\u5378\u8f7d\u5230FPGA\u7684\u7f16\u8bd1\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408OpenMP\u65b9\u8a00\u548cHLS\u65b9\u8a00\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u4efb\u4f55MLIR\u517c\u5bb9\u524d\u7aef\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u6469\u5c14\u5b9a\u5f8b\u653e\u7f13\uff0cFPGA\u7b49\u5f02\u6784\u8ba1\u7b97\u5e73\u53f0\u5728\u52a0\u901fHPC\u5de5\u4f5c\u8d1f\u8f7d\u65b9\u9762\u8d8a\u6765\u8d8a\u53d7\u5173\u6ce8\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u7075\u6d3b\u7684FPGA\u52a0\u901f\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u5c06MLIR OpenMP\u65b9\u8a00\u4e0e\u9ad8\u7ea7\u7efc\u5408(HLS)\u65b9\u8a00\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u53ef\u79fb\u690d\u7684FPGA\u7f16\u8bd1\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u6807\u51c6OpenMP\u6307\u4ee4\u8fdb\u884c\u5185\u6838\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u6210\u529f\u5b9e\u73b0\u57fa\u4e8e\u6307\u4ee4\u7684FPGA\u52a0\u901f\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u5f00\u53d1\u5de5\u4f5c\u91cf\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86MLIR\u751f\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u53ef\u7ec4\u5408\u6027\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u57fa\u4e8e\u6307\u4ee4\u7684FPGA\u52a0\u901f\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7075\u6d3b\u4e14\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u5b8c\u5168\u96c6\u6210\u5728MLIR\u751f\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u3002"}}

DC flexibility (a.k.a. load adaptation) is a key to reducing DC carbon emissions by improving grid renewable absorption.\n  DC flexibility can be created, without disturbing datacenter capacity by decoupling a datacenter's power capacity and grid load with a collection of energy resources. Because decoupling can be costly, we study how to best distribute and manage decoupling to maximize benefits for all. Key considerations include site variation and datacenter-grid cooperation.\n  We first define and compute the power and energy needs of datacenter load decoupling, and then we evaluate designed distribution and management approaches. Evaluation shows that optimized distribution can deliver >98% of the potential grid carbon reduction with 70% of the total decoupling need. For management, DC-grid cooperation (2-way sharing and control vs. 1-way info sharing) enables 1.4x grid carbon reduction. Finally, we show that decoupling may be economically viable, as on average datacenters can get power cost and carbon emissions benefits greater than their local costs of decoupling. However, skew across sites suggests grid intervention may be required.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u5fc3\u901a\u8fc7\u80fd\u6e90\u8d44\u6e90\u89e3\u8026\u7535\u529b\u5bb9\u91cf\u4e0e\u7535\u7f51\u8d1f\u8f7d\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u4ee5\u964d\u4f4e\u78b3\u6392\u653e\uff0c\u4f18\u5316\u5206\u5e03\u548c\u7ba1\u7406\u53ef\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u7535\u7f51\u78b3\u51cf\u6392\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u7ecf\u6d4e\u4e0a\u5177\u6709\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u4f46\u9700\u8981\u7535\u7f51\u5e72\u9884\u3002", "motivation": "AI\u548c\u4e91\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684\u9ad8\u80fd\u8017\u52a0\u5267\u4e86\u78b3\u8db3\u8ff9\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5176\u6052\u5b9a\u7535\u529b\u9700\u6c42\u4e0e\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u53ef\u518d\u751f\u80fd\u6e90\u53d1\u7535\u4e4b\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u77db\u76fe\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u6765\u6539\u5584\u7535\u7f51\u53ef\u518d\u751f\u80fd\u6e90\u5438\u6536\u3002", "method": "\u5b9a\u4e49\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u5fc3\u8d1f\u8f7d\u89e3\u8026\u7684\u529f\u7387\u548c\u80fd\u91cf\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u548c\u7ba1\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u7ad9\u70b9\u53d8\u5316\u548c\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u5fc3-\u7535\u7f51\u5408\u4f5c\uff08\u53cc\u5411\u5171\u4eab\u4e0e\u63a7\u5236 vs \u5355\u5411\u4fe1\u606f\u5171\u4eab\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u4f18\u5316\u5206\u5e03\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b098%\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u7535\u7f51\u78b3\u51cf\u6392\uff0c\u4ec5\u970070%\u7684\u603b\u89e3\u8026\u9700\u6c42\uff1b\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u5fc3-\u7535\u7f51\u5408\u4f5c\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b01.4\u500d\u7684\u7535\u7f51\u78b3\u51cf\u6392\uff1b\u7ecf\u6d4e\u4e0a\u5e73\u5747\u6536\u76ca\u5927\u4e8e\u672c\u5730\u89e3\u8026\u6210\u672c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u5fc3\u8d1f\u8f7d\u89e3\u8026\u662f\u964d\u4f4e\u78b3\u6392\u653e\u7684\u6709\u6548\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f18\u5316\u5206\u5e03\u548c\u7535\u7f51\u5408\u4f5c\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u867d\u7136\u7ecf\u6d4e\u53ef\u884c\u4f46\u7ad9\u70b9\u95f4\u5dee\u5f02\u9700\u8981\u7535\u7f51\u5e72\u9884\u3002"}}

Four major cloud providers by market share AWS, Azure, Google Cloud Platform (GCP), and Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) are compared across Intel, AMD, and ARM general purpose instance types under both on-demand and one-year discounted pricing. AWS consistently delivers the shortest runtime in all three instance types, yet charges a premium, especially for on-demand usage. OCI emerges as the most economical option across all CPU families, although it generally runs workloads more slowly than AWS. Azure often exhibits mid-range performance and cost, while GCP presents a mixed profile: it sees a notable boost when moving from Intel to AMD. On the other hand, its ARM instance is more than twice as slow as its own AMD offering and remains significantly more expensive. AWS's internal comparisons reveal that its ARM instance can outperform its Intel and AMD siblings by up to 49 percent in runtime. These findings highlight how instance choices and provider selection can yield substantial variations in both runtime and price, indicating that workload priorities, whether raw speed or cost minimization, should guide decisions on instance types.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bc4\u4f30\u56db\u5927\u4e91\u670d\u52a1\u5546(AWS\u3001Azure\u3001GCP\u3001OCI)\u5728\u865a\u62df\u5316\u4e91\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u4f7f\u7528SPEC ACCEL\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7684HPC CPU\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u6210\u672c\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83Intel\u3001AMD\u3001ARM\u5b9e\u4f8b\u7c7b\u578b\u5728\u6309\u9700\u548c\u4e00\u5e74\u6298\u6263\u5b9a\u4ef7\u4e0b\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e86\u89e3\u4e0d\u540c\u4e91\u670d\u52a1\u5546\u5728HPC\u5de5\u4f5c\u8d1f\u8f7d\u4e0b\u7684CPU\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u6210\u672c\u6548\u76ca\uff0c\u4e3a\u9009\u62e9\u6700\u4f18\u4e91\u5b9e\u4f8b\u63d0\u4f9b\u6570\u636e\u652f\u6301\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528SPEC ACCEL\u5957\u4ef6\u4e2d\u7684OpenMP\u5de5\u4f5c\u8d1f\u8f7d\uff0c\u6d4b\u8bd5AWS\u3001Azure\u3001GCP\u3001OCI\u56db\u5927\u4e91\u670d\u52a1\u5546\u7684Intel\u3001AMD\u3001ARM\u901a\u7528\u5b9e\u4f8b\u7c7b\u578b\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u6309\u9700\u548c\u4e00\u5e74\u6298\u6263\u5b9a\u4ef7\u3002", "result": "AWS\u5728\u6240\u6709\u4e09\u79cd\u5b9e\u4f8b\u7c7b\u578b\u4e2d\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\u6700\u77ed\u4f46\u6536\u8d39\u6700\u9ad8\uff1bOCI\u5728\u6240\u6709CPU\u5bb6\u65cf\u4e2d\u6700\u7ecf\u6d4e\u4f46\u8fd0\u884c\u8f83\u6162\uff1bAzure\u8868\u73b0\u4e2d\u7b49\uff1bGCP\u4eceIntel\u5207\u6362\u5230AMD\u65f6\u6027\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u4f46\u5176ARM\u5b9e\u4f8b\u6bd4\u81ea\u5bb6AMD\u6162\u4e24\u500d\u4e14\u66f4\u8d35\uff1bAWS\u7684ARM\u5b9e\u4f8b\u6bd4\u5176Intel\u548cAMD\u5b9e\u4f8b\u5feb\u8fbe49%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5b9e\u4f8b\u9009\u62e9\u548c\u4e91\u670d\u52a1\u5546\u9009\u62e9\u5bf9\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\u548c\u6210\u672c\u6709\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5e94\u6839\u636e\u5de5\u4f5c\u8d1f\u8f7d\u4f18\u5148\u7ea7\uff08\u539f\u59cb\u901f\u5ea6\u6216\u6210\u672c\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\uff09\u6765\u6307\u5bfc\u5b9e\u4f8b\u7c7b\u578b\u51b3\u7b56\u3002"}}

This paper proposes an agentic AI safety architecture that leverages 3D to integrate a dedicated safety layer. It introduces an adaptive AI safety infrastructure capable of dynamically learning and mitigating attacks against the AI system. The system leverages the inherent advantages of co-location with the edge computing hardware to continuously monitor, detect and proactively mitigate threats to the AI system.

However, such collocation often leads to performance interference caused by antagonistic jobs that overconsume shared resources. Existing antagonist-detection approaches either rely on offline profiling, which is costly and unscalable, or use a sample-from-production approach, which suffers from noisy measurements and fails under multi-victim scenarios. We present PANDA, a noise-resilient antagonist identification framework for production-scale datacenters. Like prior correlation-based methods, PANDA uses cycles per instruction (CPI) as its performance metric, but it differs by (i) leveraging global historical knowledge across all machines to suppress sampling noise and (ii) introducing a machine-level CPI metric that captures shared-resource contention among multiple co-located tasks. Evaluation on a recent Google production trace shows that PANDA ranks true antagonists far more accurately than prior methods -- improving average suspicion percentile from 50-55% to 82.6% -- and achieves consistent antagonist identification under multi-victim scenarios, all with negligible runtime overhead.", "AI": {"tldr": "PANDA\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u7528\u4e8e\u751f\u4ea7\u7ea7\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684\u6297\u566a\u58f0\u5e72\u6270\u8bc6\u522b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5229\u7528\u5168\u5c40\u5386\u53f2\u77e5\u8bc6\u548c\u673a\u5668\u7ea7CPI\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u91cd\u53d7\u5bb3\u8005\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u51c6\u786e\u8bc6\u522b\u6027\u80fd\u5e72\u6270\u6e90\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u4ee3\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u5fc3\u901a\u5e38\u5c06\u591a\u4e2a\u4f5c\u4e1a\u5171\u7f6e\u5728\u540c\u4e00\u673a\u5668\u4e0a\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u8d44\u6e90\u5229\u7528\u7387\uff0c\u4f46\u8fd9\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u6027\u80fd\u5e72\u6270\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u5e72\u6270\u6e90\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u8981\u4e48\u4f9d\u8d56\u6602\u8d35\u7684\u79bb\u7ebf\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u8981\u4e48\u5728\u751f\u4ea7\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u91c7\u6837\u4f46\u53d7\u566a\u58f0\u5f71\u54cd\u4e14\u65e0\u6cd5\u5904\u7406\u591a\u91cd\u53d7\u5bb3\u8005\u573a\u666f\u3002", "method": "PANDA\u4f7f\u7528CPI\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6027\u80fd\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u4f46\u901a\u8fc7(i)\u5229\u7528\u6240\u6709\u673a\u5668\u7684\u5168\u5c40\u5386\u53f2\u77e5\u8bc6\u6765\u6291\u5236\u91c7\u6837\u566a\u58f0\uff0c(ii)\u5f15\u5165\u673a\u5668\u7ea7CPI\u6307\u6807\u6765\u6355\u83b7\u591a\u4e2a\u5171\u7f6e\u4efb\u52a1\u95f4\u7684\u5171\u4eab\u8d44\u6e90\u7ade\u4e89\u3002", "result": "\u5728Google\u751f\u4ea7\u73af\u5883trace\u4e0a\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u663e\u793a\uff0cPANDA\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u5730\u8bc6\u522b\u771f\u6b63\u5e72\u6270\u6e90\u2014\u2014\u5c06\u5e73\u5747\u53ef\u7591\u767e\u5206\u4f4d\u4ece50-55%\u63d0\u5347\u523082.6%\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u591a\u91cd\u53d7\u5bb3\u8005\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u5e72\u6270\u6e90\u8bc6\u522b\uff0c\u4e14\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u5f00\u9500\u53ef\u5ffd\u7565\u3002", "conclusion": "PANDA\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u751f\u4ea7\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u5fc3\u4e2d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u5e72\u6270\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u51c6\u786e\u4e14\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u5e72\u6270\u6e90\u8bc6\u522b\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

This is significantly amplified in mobile scenarios, where the channel impulse response (CIR) becomes time-varying and stochastic. Obtaining accurate Channel State Information (CSI) for traditional model-based detection is intractable in such dynamic environments. While deep learning (DL) offers adaptability, its complexity is unsuitable for resource-constrained micro/nanodevices. This paper proposes a low-complexity Reservoir Computing (RC) based detector. The RC architecture utilizes a fixed, recurrent non-linear reservoir to project the time-varying received signal into a high-dimensional state space. This effectively transforms the complex temporal detection problem into a simple linear classification task, capturing ISI dynamics without explicit channel modeling or complex retraining. Evaluated in a realistic 3D mobile MC simulation environment (Smoldyn), our RC detector significantly outperforms classical detectors and achieves superior performance compared to complex ML methods (LSTM, CNN, MLP) under severe ISI. Importantly, RC achieves this with significantly fewer trainable parameters (e.g., 300 vs. up to 264k for MLP) and ultra-low latency inference (approx. 1 $\u03bc$s per symbol).", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u50a8\u5c42\u8ba1\u7b97\uff08RC\uff09\u7684\u4f4e\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u5206\u5b50\u901a\u4fe1\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u89e3\u51b3\u79fb\u52a8\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u4e25\u91cd\u7684\u7b26\u53f7\u95f4\u5e72\u6270\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u548c\u590d\u6742\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0cRC\u5728\u6027\u80fd\u3001\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u548c\u5ef6\u8fdf\u65b9\u9762\u5747\u6709\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "motivation": "\u5206\u5b50\u901a\u4fe1\u5728\u79fb\u52a8\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u9762\u4e34\u4e25\u91cd\u7684\u65f6\u53d8\u7b26\u53f7\u95f4\u5e72\u6270\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u57fa\u4e8e\u4fe1\u9053\u72b6\u6001\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u9002\u7528\uff0c\u800c\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u867d\u7136\u5177\u6709\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u4f46\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u9ad8\uff0c\u4e0d\u9002\u5408\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u7684\u5fae\u7eb3\u8bbe\u5907\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u50a8\u5c42\u8ba1\u7b97\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u56fa\u5b9a\u7684\u5faa\u73af\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u50a8\u5c42\u5c06\u65f6\u53d8\u63a5\u6536\u4fe1\u53f7\u6295\u5f71\u5230\u9ad8\u7ef4\u72b6\u6001\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u5c06\u590d\u6742\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u68c0\u6d4b\u95ee\u9898\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u7ebf\u6027\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u663e\u5f0f\u4fe1\u9053\u5efa\u6a21\u6216\u590d\u6742\u91cd\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "result": "\u57283D\u79fb\u52a8\u5206\u5b50\u901a\u4fe1\u4eff\u771f\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\uff0cRC\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\uff0c\u5728\u4e25\u91cd\u7b26\u53f7\u95f4\u5e72\u6270\u4e0b\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u590d\u6742\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08LSTM\u3001CNN\u3001MLP\uff09\uff0c\u4e14\u8bad\u7ec3\u53c2\u6570\u5c11\uff08300 vs 264k\uff09\uff0c\u63a8\u7406\u5ef6\u8fdf\u6781\u4f4e\uff08\u7ea61\u03bcs/\u7b26\u53f7\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "RC\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u4e3a\u79fb\u52a8\u5206\u5b50\u901a\u4fe1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u4f4e\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5728\u6027\u80fd\u3001\u8d44\u6e90\u6548\u7387\u548c\u5b9e\u65f6\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u5177\u6709\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u52bf\u3002"}}

Among them, NVIDIA Multi-Instance GPU (MIG) has gained traction for providing hardware-level isolation that enables concurrent workloads without interference.

We present Flex-MIG, a software-only framework that replaces one-to-one with a one-to-many allocation model and enables host-shared-memory collectives across MIG instances without hardware modification.

However, training remains computationally expensive, prior work reporting approximately 36 GPU-hours per dataset, limiting broader adoption and research. We propose CGAR, a novel training methodology that applies curriculum learning to architectural depth rather than traditional data ordering. CGAR introduces two synergistic components: Progressive Depth Curriculum dynamically adjusts recursion depth from shallow to deep configurations during training, preventing early overfitting while reducing computational cost, and Hierarchical Supervision Weighting applies exponentially decaying importance to supervision steps, aligning loss weighting with observed gradient magnitude decay. On Sudoku-Extreme with 423,168 test puzzles, CGAR achieves 1.71x training speedup (10.93 to 6.38 hours, 42% cost reduction) with only 0.63% accuracy drop (86.65% to 86.02%). Systematic ablations reveal Progressive Depth Curriculum alone achieves 2.26x speedup with 85.47% accuracy, demonstrating a rare Pareto improvement where architectural curriculum simultaneously enhances training efficiency and solution quality. CGAR-trained models exhibit superior inference efficiency with 100% halting accuracy and 11% fewer reasoning steps.

However, as matrix size grows, interconnect resistance increasingly degrades computational accuracy and limits circuit scalability. Modeling and evaluating these effects are therefore critical for developing effective mitigation strategies. Traditional SPICE (Simulation Program with Integrated Circuit Emphasis) simulators, which rely on modified nodal analysis, become prohibitively slow for large-scale AMC circuits due to the quadratic growth of nodes and feedback connections. In this work, we model AMC circuits with interconnect resistance for two key operations-matrix inversion (INV) and eigenvector computation (EGV), and propose fast solving algorithms tailored for each case. The algorithms exploit the sparsity of the Jacobian matrix, enabling rapid and accurate solutions. Compared to SPICE, they achieve several orders of magnitude acceleration while maintaining high accuracy. We further extend the approach to open-loop matrix-vector multiplication (MVM) circuits, demonstrating similar efficiency gains. Finally, leveraging these fast solvers, we develop a bias-based compensation strategy that reduces interconnect-induced errors by over 50% for INV and 70% for EGV circuits. It also reveals the scaling behavior of the optimal bias with respect to matrix size and interconnect resistance.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u9488\u5bf9\u5177\u6709\u4e92\u8fde\u7535\u963b\u7684\u6a21\u62df\u77e9\u9635\u8ba1\u7b97\u7535\u8def\u7684\u5feb\u901f\u6c42\u89e3\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edfSPICE\u4eff\u771f\u5668\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u51e0\u4e2a\u6570\u91cf\u7ea7\u7684\u52a0\u901f\uff0c\u5e76\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u504f\u7f6e\u8865\u507f\u7b56\u7565\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u4e92\u8fde\u5f15\u8d77\u7684\u8bef\u5dee\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u77e9\u9635\u5c3a\u5bf8\u589e\u5927\uff0c\u4e92\u8fde\u7535\u963b\u4f1a\u964d\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u7cbe\u5ea6\u5e76\u9650\u5236\u7535\u8def\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\uff0c\u800c\u4f20\u7edfSPICE\u4eff\u771f\u5668\u7531\u4e8e\u8282\u70b9\u548c\u53cd\u9988\u8fde\u63a5\u7684\u4e8c\u6b21\u589e\u957f\u800c\u53d8\u5f97\u8fc7\u4e8e\u7f13\u6162\u3002", "method": "\u4e3a\u77e9\u9635\u6c42\u9006\u548c\u7279\u5f81\u5411\u91cf\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e24\u79cd\u5173\u952e\u64cd\u4f5c\u5efa\u6a21AMC\u7535\u8def\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u96c5\u53ef\u6bd4\u77e9\u9635\u7684\u7a00\u758f\u6027\u63d0\u51fa\u5feb\u901f\u6c42\u89e3\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u5f00\u73af\u77e9\u9635\u5411\u91cf\u4e58\u6cd5\u7535\u8def\u3002", "result": "\u76f8\u6bd4SPICE\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u51e0\u4e2a\u6570\u91cf\u7ea7\u7684\u52a0\u901f\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff1b\u5f00\u53d1\u7684\u504f\u7f6e\u8865\u507f\u7b56\u7565\u4f7f\u4e92\u8fde\u5f15\u8d77\u7684\u8bef\u5dee\u51cf\u5c11\u8d85\u8fc750%\uff08\u6c42\u9006\uff09\u548c70%\uff08\u7279\u5f81\u5411\u91cf\u8ba1\u7b97\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u5feb\u901f\u7b97\u6cd5\u548c\u504f\u7f6e\u8865\u507f\u7b56\u7565\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86AMC\u7535\u8def\u4e2d\u4e92\u8fde\u7535\u963b\u5f15\u8d77\u7684\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u6700\u4f18\u504f\u7f6e\u968f\u77e9\u9635\u5c3a\u5bf8\u548c\u4e92\u8fde\u7535\u963b\u7684\u7f29\u653e\u884c\u4e3a\u3002"}}

One of the greatest advantages of this is that concurrency and synchronization is manged entirely in the userspace, omitting heavy-weight system calls. However, we find that state-of-the-art userspace synchronization primitives approach synchronization in the userspace from the perspective of kernel-level scheduling. This introduces unnecessary delays on the critical path of the application, limiting throughput. In this paper, we re-think synchronization for tasks that are scheduled entirely in the userspace (e.g., coroutines, fibers, etc.). We develop Combine-and-Exchange Scheduling (CES), a novel scheduling approach that ensures contended critical sections stay on the same thread of execution while parallelizable work is evenly spread across the remaining threads.

We first show that the RWG basis is essentially a static and piecewise-linear realization of the Kolmogorov-Arnold representation theorem. Inspired by this insight, we propose PhyKAN, a physics-informed Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) that generalizes RWG into a learnable and adaptive basis family. Derived from the EFIE, PhyKAN integrates a local KAN branch with a global branch embedded with Green's function priors to preserve physical consistency.

To address the inherent complexity of hybrid optical-radio environments, a high-fidelity Digital Twin (DT) is developed within the Network Simulator 3 (NS-3) platform. The DT models deploy subsystems of the RIoT architecture, including radio frequency (RF) communication, optical wireless communication (OWC), and energy harvesting and consumption mechanisms that enable autonomous operation. Real-time energy and power measurements from target hardware platforms are also incorporated to ensure accurate representation of physical behavior and enable runtime analysis and optimization. Building on this foundation, a proactive cross-layer optimization strategy is devised to balance energy efficiency and quality of service (QoS). The strategy dynamically reconfigures RIoT nodes by adapting transmission rates, wake/sleep scheduling, and access technology selection. Results demonstrate that the proposed framework, combining digital twin technology, hybrid optical-radio integration, and data-driven energy modeling, substantially enhances the performance, resilience, and sustainability of 6G IoT networks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u53ef\u91cd\u6784\u7269\u8054\u7f51\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u96c6\u6210\u5149\u65e0\u7ebf\u548c\u65e0\u7ebf\u7535\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6570\u5b57\u5b6a\u751f\u5efa\u6a21\u5b9e\u73b0\u80fd\u6548\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u548c\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u6df7\u5408\u5149\u65e0\u7ebf-\u65e0\u7ebf\u7535\u73af\u5883\u7684\u590d\u6742\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u53476G\u7269\u8054\u7f51\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3001\u5f39\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u5728NS-3\u5e73\u53f0\u5f00\u53d1\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u6570\u5b57\u5b6a\u751f\uff0c\u5efa\u6a21RF\u901a\u4fe1\u3001\u5149\u65e0\u7ebf\u901a\u4fe1\u548c\u80fd\u91cf\u6536\u96c6\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u4e3b\u52a8\u8de8\u5c42\u4f18\u5316\u7b56\u7565\u52a8\u6001\u91cd\u914d\u7f6e\u8282\u70b9\u3002", "result": "\u6846\u67b6\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e866G\u7269\u8054\u7f51\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3001\u5f39\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7ed3\u5408\u6570\u5b57\u5b6a\u751f\u6280\u672f\u3001\u6df7\u5408\u5149\u65e0\u7ebf-\u65e0\u7ebf\u7535\u96c6\u6210\u548c\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u80fd\u91cf\u5efa\u6a21\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u53ef\u6709\u6548\u589e\u5f3a\u7269\u8054\u7f51\u7f51\u7edc\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

Lock-free concurrent queue with coordination-free memory reclamation", "summary": "The queue is conceptually one of the simplest data structures-a basic FIFO container. However, ensuring correctness in the presence of concurrency makes existing lock-free implementations significantly more complex than their original form. Coordination mechanisms introduced to prevent hazards such as ABA, use-after-free, and unsafe reclamation often dominate the design, overshadowing the queue itself. Many schemes compromise strict FIFO ordering, unbounded capacity, or lock-free progress to mask coordination overheads. Yet the true source of complexity lies in the pursuit of infinite protection against reclamation hazards--theoretically sound but impractical and costly. This pursuit not only drives unnecessary complexity but also creates a protection paradox where excessive protection reduces system resilience rather than improving it. While such costs may be tolerable in conventional workloads, the AI era has shifted the paradigm: training and inference pipelines involve hundreds to thousands of concurrent threads per node, and at this scale, protection and coordination overheads dominate, often far heavier than the basic queue operations themselves.\n  This paper introduces Cyclic Memory Protection (CMP), a coordination-free queue that preserves strict FIFO semantics, unbounded capacity, and lock-free progress while restoring simplicity. CMP reclaims the strict FIFO that other approaches sacrificed through bounded protection windows that provide practical reclamation guarantees. We prove strict FIFO and safety via linearizability and bounded reclamation analysis, and show experimentally that CMP outperforms state-of-the-art lock-free queues by up to 1.72-4x under high contention while maintaining scalability to hundreds of threads. Our work demonstrates that highly concurrent queues can return to their fundamental simplicity without weakening queue semantics.", "AI": {"tldr": "CMP\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u534f\u8c03\u7684\u9501\u81ea\u7531\u961f\u5217\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6709\u754c\u4fdd\u62a4\u7a97\u53e3\u6062\u590d\u4e25\u683cFIFO\u8bed\u4e49\uff0c\u5728\u9ad8\u5e76\u53d1\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u961f\u52171.72-4\u500d\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u9501\u81ea\u7531\u961f\u5217\u4e3a\u9632\u8303ABA\u3001\u91ca\u653e\u540e\u4f7f\u7528\u7b49\u98ce\u9669\u800c\u5f15\u5165\u590d\u6742\u534f\u8c03\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u4fdd\u62a4\u5f00\u9500\u8fdc\u8d85\u961f\u5217\u64cd\u4f5c\u672c\u8eab\uff0c\u5728AI\u65f6\u4ee3\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5e76\u53d1\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u95ee\u9898\u5c24\u4e3a\u7a81\u51fa\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5faa\u73af\u5185\u5b58\u4fdd\u62a4(CMP)\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u6709\u754c\u4fdd\u62a4\u7a97\u53e3\u63d0\u4f9b\u5b9e\u9645\u7684\u91cd\u7528\u4fdd\u8bc1\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u534f\u8c03\u5373\u53ef\u4fdd\u6301\u4e25\u683cFIFO\u3001\u65e0\u754c\u5bb9\u91cf\u548c\u9501\u81ea\u7531\u8fdb\u5c55\u3002", "result": "CMP\u5728\u9ad8\u7ade\u4e89\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u6027\u80fd\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u6700\u4f18\u9501\u81ea\u7531\u961f\u5217\u63d0\u53471.72-4\u500d\uff0c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u6570\u767e\u7ebf\u7a0b\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e25\u683cFIFO\u8bed\u4e49\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9ad8\u5ea6\u5e76\u53d1\u961f\u5217\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u4e0d\u524a\u5f31\u961f\u5217\u8bed\u4e49\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\u56de\u5f52\u57fa\u672c\u7b80\u5355\u6027\uff0c\u6709\u754c\u4fdd\u62a4\u7a97\u53e3\u6bd4\u65e0\u9650\u4fdd\u62a4\u66f4\u5b9e\u7528\u4e14\u9ad8\u6548\u3002"}}

To address these challenges, we propose PEGNet, a Physics-Embedded Graph Network that incorporates PDE-guided message passing to redesign the graph neural network architecture. By embedding key PDE dynamics like convection, viscosity, and diffusion into distinct message functions, the model naturally integrates physical constraints into its forward propagation, producing more stable and physically consistent solutions. Additionally, a hierarchical architecture is employed to capture multi-scale features, and physical regularization is integrated into the loss function to further enforce adherence to governing physics. We evaluated PEGNet on benchmarks, including custom datasets for respiratory airflow and drug delivery, showing significant improvements in long-term prediction accuracy and physical consistency over existing methods.

In these contexts, accuracy is only one piece of the puzzle - models must also be fair to different groups, protect individual privacy, and remain accountable to stakeholders. Achieving all three is difficult: differential privacy can unintentionally worsen disparities, fairness interventions often rely on sensitive data that privacy restricts, and automated pipelines ignore that fairness is ultimately a human and contextual judgment. We introduce FAIRPLAI (Fair and Private Learning with Active Human Influence), a practical framework that integrates human oversight into the design and deployment of machine learning systems. FAIRPLAI works in three ways: (1) it constructs privacy-fairness frontiers that make trade-offs between accuracy, privacy guarantees, and group outcomes transparent; (2) it enables interactive stakeholder input, allowing decision-makers to select fairness criteria and operating points that reflect their domain needs; and (3) it embeds a differentially private auditing loop, giving humans the ability to review explanations and edge cases without compromising individual data security. Applied to benchmark datasets, FAIRPLAI consistently preserves strong privacy protections while reducing fairness disparities relative to automated baselines. More importantly, it provides a straightforward, interpretable process for practitioners to manage competing demands of accuracy, privacy, and fairness in socially impactful applications. By embedding human judgment where it matters most, FAIRPLAI offers a pathway to machine learning systems that are effective, responsible, and trustworthy in practice.

On LLM Agent Behavior in Dictator Games", "comment": "7 pages, 2 figures, v1 init", "summary": "In behavioral sciences, experiments such as the ultimatum game are conducted to assess preferences for fairness or self-interest of study participants. In the dictator game, a simplified version of the ultimatum game where only one of two players makes a single decision, the dictator unilaterally decides how to split a fixed sum of money between themselves and the other player. Although recent studies have explored behavioral patterns of AI agents based on Large Language Models (LLMs) instructed to adopt different personas, we question the robustness of these results. In particular, many of these studies overlook the role of the system prompt - the underlying instructions that shape the model's behavior - and do not account for how sensitive results can be to slight changes in prompts. However, a robust baseline is essential when studying highly complex behavioral aspects of LLMs. To overcome previous limitations, we propose the LLM agent behavior study (LLM-ABS) framework to (i) explore how different system prompts influence model behavior, (ii) get more reliable insights into agent preferences by using neutral prompt variations, and (iii) analyze linguistic features in responses to open-ended instructions by LLM agents to better understand the reasoning behind their behavior. We found that agents often exhibit a strong preference for fairness, as well as a significant impact of the system prompt on their behavior. From a linguistic perspective, we identify that models express their responses differently. Although prompt sensitivity remains a persistent challenge, our proposed framework demonstrates a robust foundation for LLM agent behavior studies.

Prior methods--such as LocalNewton, LTDA, and FedSophia--have incorporated second-order optimization in FL by performing iterative local updates on clients and applying simple mixing of local parameters on the server. However, these methods often suffer from drift in local preconditioners, which significantly disrupts the convergence of parameter training, particularly in heterogeneous data settings. To overcome this issue, we refine the update rules by decomposing the ideal second-order update--computed using globally preconditioned global gradients--into parameter mixing on the server and local parameter updates on clients. As a result, our FedPM introduces preconditioned mixing of local parameters on the server, effectively mitigating drift in local preconditioners.\n  We provide a theoretical convergence analysis demonstrating a superlinear rate for strongly convex objectives in scenarios involving a single local update. To demonstrate the practical benefits of FedPM, we conducted extensive experiments.

The first method, termed Greedy Pair Coarsening (GPC), iteratively merges pairs of nodes that locally minimize a measure of distortion until the desired size is achieved. The second method, termed $k$-means Greedy Pair Coarsening (KGPC), leverages clustering based on pairwise distortion metrics to directly merge clusters of nodes. We provide conditions guaranteeing optimal coarsening for our methods and validate their performance on six large-scale datasets and a downstream clustering task. Results show that the proposed methods outperform existing approaches on a wide range of parameters and scenarios.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e24\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8eGromov-Wasserstein\u51e0\u4f55\u7684\u56fe\u7c97\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5\uff1aGPC\u548cKGPC\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u8282\u70b9\u5408\u5e76\u7684\u5931\u771f\u5ea6\u6765\u4f18\u5316\u56fe\u7c97\u5316\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u56fe\u7c97\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u5728Gromov-Wasserstein\u51e0\u4f55\u6846\u67b6\u4e0b\u5f00\u53d1\u6709\u6548\u7684\u56fe\u7ed3\u6784\u7b80\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ee5\u5904\u7406\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u56fe\u6570\u636e\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e24\u79cd\u7b97\u6cd5\uff1aGPC\uff08\u8d2a\u5a6a\u5bf9\u7c97\u5316\uff09\u8fed\u4ee3\u5408\u5e76\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u5c40\u90e8\u5931\u771f\u7684\u8282\u70b9\u5bf9\uff1bKGPC\uff08k\u5747\u503c\u8d2a\u5a6a\u5bf9\u7c97\u5316\uff09\u57fa\u4e8e\u6210\u5bf9\u5931\u771f\u5ea6\u91cf\u7684\u805a\u7c7b\u76f4\u63a5\u5408\u5e76\u8282\u70b9\u7c07\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u516d\u4e2a\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u4e0b\u6e38\u805a\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5e7f\u6cdb\u53c2\u6570\u548c\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u57fa\u4e8eGromov-Wasserstein\u51e0\u4f55\u7684\u56fe\u7c97\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\uff0cGPC\u548cKGPC\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u56fe\u7ed3\u6784\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u7c97\u5316\u6548\u679c\u3002"}}

Yet, for many practical systems -- especially in aerospace -- this region cannot be determined a priori and is often challenging to compute. One of the most common methods for computing the stability region is to identify a Lyapunov function. A Lyapunov function is a positive function whose time derivative along system trajectories is non-positive, which provides a sufficient condition for stability and characterizes an estimated stability region. However, existing methods of characterizing a stability region via a Lyapunov function often rely on explicit knowledge of the system governing equations. In this work, we present a new physics-informed machine learning method of characterizing an estimated stability region by inferring a Lyapunov function from system trajectory data that treats the dynamical system as a black box and does not require explicit knowledge of the system governing equations. In our presented Lyapunov function Inference method (LyapInf), we propose a quadratic form for the unknown Lyapunov function and fit the unknown quadratic operator to system trajectory data by minimizing the average residual of the Zubov equation, a first-order partial differential equation whose solution yields a Lyapunov function. The inferred quadratic Lyapunov function can then characterize an ellipsoidal estimate of the stability region. Numerical results on benchmark examples demonstrate that our physics-informed stability analysis method successfully characterizes a near-maximal ellipsoid of the system stability region associated with the inferred Lyapunov function without requiring knowledge of the system governing equations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u7269\u7406\u4fe1\u606f\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5LyapInf\uff0c\u4ece\u7cfb\u7edf\u8f68\u8ff9\u6570\u636e\u63a8\u65adLyapunov\u51fd\u6570\u6765\u4f30\u8ba1\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u7cfb\u7edf\u63a7\u5236\u65b9\u7a0b\u7684\u663e\u5f0f\u77e5\u8bc6\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u590d\u6742\u52a8\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bbe\u8ba1\u548c\u8fd0\u884c\u4e2d\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u72b6\u6001\u8f68\u8ff9\u6536\u655b\u5230\u671f\u671b\u5e73\u8861\u70b9\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002\u7136\u800c\u5bf9\u4e8e\u8bb8\u591a\u5b9e\u9645\u7cfb\u7edf\uff08\u7279\u522b\u662f\u822a\u7a7a\u822a\u5929\u9886\u57df\uff09\uff0c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u533a\u57df\u65e0\u6cd5\u5148\u9a8c\u786e\u5b9a\u4e14\u96be\u4ee5\u8ba1\u7b97\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u4f9d\u8d56\u7cfb\u7edf\u63a7\u5236\u65b9\u7a0b\u7684\u663e\u5f0f\u77e5\u8bc6\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faLyapInf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a\u5047\u8bbe\u672a\u77e5Lyapunov\u51fd\u6570\u4e3a\u4e8c\u6b21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6700\u5c0f\u5316Zubov\u65b9\u7a0b\u7684\u5e73\u5747\u6b8b\u5dee\u6765\u62df\u5408\u672a\u77e5\u4e8c\u6b21\u7b97\u5b50\u5230\u7cfb\u7edf\u8f68\u8ff9\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5c06\u52a8\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u89c6\u4e3a\u9ed1\u7bb1\u5904\u7406\u3002", "result": "\u6570\u503c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u6210\u529f\u8868\u5f81\u4e86\u4e0e\u63a8\u65adLyapunov\u51fd\u6570\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u533a\u57df\u7684\u8fd1\u6700\u5927\u692d\u7403\u4f53\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u7cfb\u7edf\u63a7\u5236\u65b9\u7a0b\u77e5\u8bc6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u7cfb\u7edf\u63a7\u5236\u65b9\u7a0b\u663e\u5f0f\u77e5\u8bc6\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u5206\u6790\u65b0\u9014\u5f84\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u4f30\u8ba1\u52a8\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u533a\u57df\u3002"}}

We explicitly model how inter-agent coordination structures evolve over time. While most MARL approaches rely on static or per-step relational graphs, they overlook the temporal evolution of interactions that naturally arise as agents adapt, move, or reorganize cooperation strategies. Capturing such evolving dependencies is key to achieving robust and adaptive coordination. To this end, TIGER constructs dynamic temporal graphs of MARL agents, connecting their current and historical interactions. It then employs a temporal attention-based encoder to aggregate information across these structural and temporal neighborhoods, yielding time-aware agent embeddings that guide cooperative policy learning. Through extensive experiments on two coordination-intensive benchmarks, we show that TIGER consistently outperforms diverse value-decomposition and graph-based MARL baselines in task performance and sample efficiency. Furthermore, we conduct comprehensive ablation studies to isolate the impact of key design parameters in TIGER, revealing how structural and temporal factors can jointly shape effective policy learning in MARL.

Existing techniques typically address only one of these issues, as reducing DP noise can exacerbate clipping bias and vice-versa. In this paper, we propose a novel method, \\emph{DP-PMLF}, which integrates per-sample momentum with a low-pass filtering strategy to simultaneously mitigate DP noise and clipping bias. Our approach uses per-sample momentum to smooth gradient estimates prior to clipping, thereby reducing sampling variance. It further employs a post-processing low-pass filter to attenuate high-frequency DP noise without consuming additional privacy budget.

This makes it especially desirable for resource-constrained fields such as the medical domain. While recent GNN-based approaches show promise, they suffer from two key limitations: (1) matrix-based node super-resolution that disregards graph structure and lacks permutation invariance; and (2) reliance on node representations to infer edge weights, which limits scalability and expressivity. In this work, we propose two GNN-agnostic frameworks to address these issues. First, Bi-SR introduces a bipartite graph connecting LR and HR nodes to enable structure-aware node super-resolution that preserves topology and permutation invariance. Second, DEFEND learns edge representations by mapping HR edges to nodes of a dual graph, allowing edge inference via standard node-based GNNs. We evaluate both frameworks on a real-world brain connectome dataset, where they achieve state-of-the-art performance across seven topological measures. To support generalization, we introduce twelve new simulated datasets that capture diverse topologies and LR-HR relationships. These enable comprehensive benchmarking of graph super-resolution methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e24\u79cdGNN\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u56fe\u8d85\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u6846\u67b6\uff1aBi-SR\u901a\u8fc7\u4e8c\u5206\u56fe\u8fde\u63a5\u4f4e\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u548c\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u8282\u70b9\u5b9e\u73b0\u7ed3\u6784\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u8282\u70b9\u8d85\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\uff0cDEFEND\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u8fb9\u6620\u5c04\u5230\u5bf9\u5076\u56fe\u8282\u70b9\u6765\u5b66\u4e60\u8fb9\u8868\u793a\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u56fe\u8d85\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u9650\u5236\uff1a\u57fa\u4e8e\u77e9\u9635\u7684\u8282\u70b9\u8d85\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u56fe\u7ed3\u6784\u4e14\u7f3a\u4e4f\u6392\u5217\u4e0d\u53d8\u6027\uff1b\u4f9d\u8d56\u8282\u70b9\u8868\u793a\u63a8\u65ad\u8fb9\u6743\u91cd\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u548c\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "Bi-SR\u6846\u67b6\u4f7f\u7528\u4e8c\u5206\u56fe\u8fde\u63a5LR\u548cHR\u8282\u70b9\uff0c\u4fdd\u6301\u62d3\u6251\u548c\u6392\u5217\u4e0d\u53d8\u6027\uff1bDEFEND\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06HR\u8fb9\u6620\u5c04\u5230\u5bf9\u5076\u56fe\u8282\u70b9\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u6807\u51c6\u8282\u70b9GNN\u8fdb\u884c\u8fb9\u63a8\u65ad\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u8111\u8fde\u63a5\u7ec4\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u4e24\u4e2a\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u4e03\u4e2a\u62d3\u6251\u5ea6\u91cf\u4e0a\u8fbe\u5230\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u6027\u80fd\uff1b\u8fd8\u5f15\u5165\u4e8612\u4e2a\u6a21\u62df\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7528\u4e8e\u5168\u9762\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u4e24\u79cdGNN\u65e0\u5173\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u56fe\u8d85\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u7ed3\u6784\u611f\u77e5\u548c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4f18\u5f02\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

However, forecasting SWE is challenging because SWE is influenced by various factors including topography and an array of environmental conditions, and has therefore been observed to be spatio-temporally variable. Classical approaches to SWE forecasting have not adequately utilized these spatial/temporal correlations, nor do they provide uncertainty estimates -- which can be of significant value to the decision maker. In this paper, we present ForeSWE, a new probabilistic spatio-temporal forecasting model that integrates deep learning and classical probabilistic techniques. The resulting model features a combination of an attention mechanism to integrate spatiotemporal features and interactions, alongside a Gaussian process module that provides principled quantification of prediction uncertainty. We evaluate the model on data from 512 Snow Telemetry (SNOTEL) stations in the Western US. The results show significant improvements in both forecasting accuracy and prediction interval compared to existing approaches.

To address these challenges, we present EEG-X, a device-agnostic and noise-robust foundation model for EEG representation learning. EEG-X introduces a novel location-based channel embedding that encodes spatial information and improves generalization across domains and tasks by allowing the model to handle varying channel numbers, combinations, and recording lengths. To enhance robustness against noise, EEG-X employs a noise-aware masking and reconstruction strategy in both raw and latent spaces. Unlike previous models that mask and reconstruct raw noisy EEG signals, EEG-X is trained to reconstruct denoised signals obtained through an artifact removal process, ensuring that the learned representations focus on neural activity rather than noise. To further enhance reconstruction-based pretraining, EEG-X introduces a dictionary-inspired convolutional transformation (DiCT) layer that projects signals into a structured feature space before computing reconstruction (MSE) loss, reducing noise sensitivity and capturing frequency- and shape-aware similarities. Experiments on datasets collected from diverse devices show that EEG-X outperforms state-of-the-art methods across multiple downstream EEG tasks and excels in cross-domain settings where pre-trained and downstream datasets differ in electrode layouts.

While recent deep learning models have advanced automated staging, most rely solely on raw PSG signals and neglect contextual cues used by human experts. We propose a two-stage architecture that combines a Transformer-based per-epoch encoder with a 1D CNN aggregator, and systematically investigates the effect of incorporating explicit context: subject-level clinical metadata (age, sex, BMI) and per-epoch expert event annotations (apneas, desaturations, arousals, periodic breathing). Using the Sleep Heart Health Study (SHHS) cohort (n=8,357), we demonstrate that contextual fusion substantially improves staging accuracy. Compared to a PSG-only baseline (macro-F1 0.7745, micro-F1 0.8774), our final model achieves macro-F1 0.8031 and micro-F1 0.9051, with event annotations contributing the largest gains.

As a prominent example, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) projects data points onto the eigenvectors of their covariance matrix, capturing the directions of maximum variance. This mapping, however, falls short in two directions: it fails to capture information in low-variance directions, relevant when, e.g., the data contains high-variance noise; and it provides unstable results in low-sample regimes, especially when covariance eigenvalues are close. CoVariance Neural Networks (VNNs), i.e., graph neural networks using the covariance matrix as a graph, show improved stability to estimation errors and learn more expressive functions in the covariance spectrum than PCA, but require training and operate in a labeled setup. To get the benefits of both worlds, we propose Covariance Scattering Transforms (CSTs), deep untrained networks that sequentially apply filters localized in the covariance spectrum to the input data and produce expressive hierarchical representations via nonlinearities. We define the filters as covariance wavelets that capture specific and detailed covariance spectral patterns. We improve CSTs' computational and memory efficiency via a pruning mechanism, and we prove that their error due to finite-sample covariance estimations is less sensitive to close covariance eigenvalues compared to PCA, improving their stability. Our experiments on age prediction from cortical thickness measurements on 4 datasets collecting patients with neurodegenerative diseases show that CSTs produce stable representations in low-data settings, as VNNs but without any training, and lead to comparable or better predictions w.r.t. more complex learning models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86Covariance Scattering Transforms (CSTs)\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5e94\u7528\u534f\u65b9\u5dee\u8c31\u4e2d\u7684\u5c40\u90e8\u5316\u6ee4\u6ce2\u5668\u6765\u751f\u6210\u5c42\u6b21\u5316\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u5728\u4f4e\u6570\u636e\u91cf\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u6bd4PCA\u66f4\u7a33\u5b9a\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u66f4\u590d\u6742\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u76f8\u5f53\u6216\u66f4\u597d\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edfPCA\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u4e3b\u8981\u95ee\u9898\uff1a\u65e0\u6cd5\u6355\u6349\u4f4e\u65b9\u5dee\u65b9\u5411\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\uff08\u5f53\u6570\u636e\u5305\u542b\u9ad8\u65b9\u5dee\u566a\u58f0\u65f6\u5f88\u91cd\u8981\uff09\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5728\u4f4e\u6837\u672c\u91cf\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u7ed3\u679c\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\uff08\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5f53\u534f\u65b9\u5dee\u7279\u5f81\u503c\u63a5\u8fd1\u65f6\uff09\u3002VNNs\u867d\u7136\u6539\u8fdb\u4e86\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u4f46\u9700\u8981\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e14\u4f9d\u8d56\u6807\u7b7e\u6570\u636e\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faCSTs\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u534f\u65b9\u5dee\u77e9\u9635\u4f5c\u4e3a\u56fe\uff0c\u987a\u5e8f\u5e94\u7528\u534f\u65b9\u5dee\u8c31\u4e2d\u7684\u5c40\u90e8\u5316\u6ee4\u6ce2\u5668\uff08\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e3a\u534f\u65b9\u5dee\u5c0f\u6ce2\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u6fc0\u6d3b\u51fd\u6570\u751f\u6210\u8868\u8fbe\u6027\u5c42\u6b21\u8868\u793a\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u526a\u679d\u673a\u5236\u63d0\u9ad8\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u5185\u5b58\u6548\u7387\u3002", "result": "\u57284\u4e2a\u795e\u7ecf\u9000\u884c\u6027\u75be\u75c5\u60a3\u8005\u76ae\u5c42\u539a\u5ea6\u6d4b\u91cf\u7684\u5e74\u9f84\u9884\u6d4b\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0cCSTs\u5728\u4f4e\u6570\u636e\u91cf\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u4ea7\u751f\u7a33\u5b9a\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u5373\u53ef\u8fbe\u5230\u4e0eVNNs\u76f8\u5f53\u7684\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u66f4\u590d\u6742\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u76f8\u5f53\u6216\u66f4\u597d\u3002", "conclusion": "CSTs\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86PCA\u548cVNNs\u7684\u4f18\u70b9\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u5373\u53ef\u5728\u4f4e\u6570\u636e\u91cf\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u63d0\u4f9b\u7a33\u5b9a\u4e14\u8868\u8fbe\u6027\u5f3a\u7684\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u5bf9\u534f\u65b9\u5dee\u4f30\u8ba1\u8bef\u5dee\u7684\u654f\u611f\u6027\u4f4e\u4e8ePCA\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u534f\u65b9\u5dee\u7279\u5f81\u503c\u63a5\u8fd1\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u3002"}}

However, existing automated diagnosis methods suffer from fairness issues across demographic groups, potentially exacerbating healthcare disparities. In this work we propose FAST-CAD, a theoretically grounded framework that combines domain-adversarial training (DAT) with group distributionally robust optimization (Group-DRO) for fair and accurate non-contact stroke diagnosis. Our approach is built on domain adaptation and minimax fairness theory and provides convergence guarantees and fairness bounds. We curate a multimodal dataset covering 12 demographic subgroups defined by age, gender, and posture. FAST-CAD employs self-supervised encoders with adversarial domain discrimination to learn demographic-invariant representations, while Group-DRO optimizes worst-group risk to ensure robust performance across all subgroups.

The importance of transportation networks and ITS for modern mobility and commerce necessitates forecasting models that are not only accurate but also interpretable, efficient, and robust under structural or temporal perturbations. Recent approaches, particularly Transformer-based architectures, have improved predictive performance but often at the cost of high computational overhead and diminished architectural interpretability. In this work, we introduce Weaver, a novel attention-based model that applies Kronecker product approximations (KPA) to decompose the PN X PN spatiotemporal attention of O(P^2N^2) complexity into local P X P temporal and N X N spatial attention maps. This Kronecker attention map enables our Parallel-Kronecker Matrix-Vector product (P2-KMV) for efficient spatiotemporal message passing with O(P^2N + N^2P) complexity. To capture real-world traffic dynamics, we address the importance of negative edges in modeling traffic behavior by introducing Valence Attention using the continuous Tanimoto coefficient (CTC), which provides properties conducive to precise latent graph generation and training stability. To fully utilize the model's learning capacity, we introduce the Traffic Phase Dictionary for self-conditioning.

Recently, diffusion models have been leveraged for their strong distribution-matching capabilities, enforcing conservatism through behavior policy constraints. However, existing methods often apply indiscriminate regularization to redundant actions in low-quality datasets, resulting in excessive conservatism and an imbalance between the expressiveness and efficiency of diffusion modeling. To address these issues, we propose DIffusion policies with Value-conditional Optimization (DIVO), a novel approach that leverages diffusion models to generate high-quality, broadly covered in-distribution state-action samples while facilitating efficient policy improvement. Specifically, DIVO introduces a binary-weighted mechanism that utilizes the advantage values of actions in the offline dataset to guide diffusion model training. This enables a more precise alignment with the dataset's distribution while selectively expanding the boundaries of high-advantage actions. During policy improvement, DIVO dynamically filters high-return-potential actions from the diffusion model, effectively guiding the learned policy toward better performance.

Existing defenses often attempt to identify and remove backdoor neurons based on Trigger-Activated Changes (TAC) which is the activation differences between clean and poisoned data. These methods suffer from low precision in identifying true backdoor neurons due to inaccurate estimation of TAC values. In this work, we propose a novel backdoor removal method by accurately reconstructing TAC values in the latent representation. Specifically, we formulate the minimal perturbation that forces clean data to be classified into a specific class as a convex quadratic optimization problem, whose optimal solution serves as a surrogate for TAC. We then identify the poisoned class by detecting statistically small $L^2$ norms of perturbations and leverage the perturbation of the poisoned class in fine-tuning to remove backdoors.

However, existing SMoE models often rely on auxiliary losses (e.g., z-loss, load balancing) and additional trainable parameters (e.g., noisy gating) to encourage expert diversity, leading to objective misalignment and increased model complexity. Moreover, existing Sinkhorn-based methods suffer from significant training overhead due to their heavy reliance on the computationally expensive Sinkhorn algorithm. In this work, we formulate token-to-expert assignment as an optimal transport problem, incorporating constraints to ensure balanced expert utilization. We demonstrate that introducing a minimal degree of optimal transport-based routing enhances SMoE performance without requiring auxiliary balancing losses. Unlike previous methods, our approach derives gating scores directly from the transport map, enabling more effective token-to-expert balancing, supported by both theoretical analysis and empirical results. Building on these insights, we propose Selective Sinkhorn Routing (SSR), a routing mechanism that replaces auxiliary loss with lightweight Sinkhorn-based routing. SSR promotes balanced token assignments while preserving flexibility in expert selection.

Here, we propose BRIDGE, a data-reuse RCT design for AI-based risk models. AI risk models support a broad range of interventions, including screening, treatment selection, and clinical alerts. BRIDGE trials recycle participant-level data from completed trials of AI models when legacy and updated models make concordant predictions, thereby reducing the enrollment requirement for subsequent trials. We provide a practical checklist for investigators to assess whether reusing data from previous trials allows for valid causal inference and preserves type I error. Using real-world datasets across breast cancer, cardiovascular disease, and sepsis, we demonstrate concordance between successive AI models, with up to 64.8% overlap in top 5% high-risk cohorts. We then simulate a series of breast cancer screening studies, where our design reduced required enrollment by 46.6%--saving over US$2.8 million--while maintaining 80% power.

We present Federated LLM-based Autonomous Driving (FLAD), an FL framework that leverages distributed multimodal sensory data across AVs in heterogeneous environment.

In addition, we prototype FLAD in a testbed with NVIDIA Jetsons, overcoming practical implementation challenges including CPU/GPU memory sharing in resource-constrained devices, dynamic model partitions, and fault-tolerant training.Extensive experimental evaluation demonstrates that FLAD achieves superior end-to-end AD performance while efficiently utilizing distributed vehicular resources, opening up new possibilities for future collaborative AD model training and knowledge sharing.", "AI": {"tldr": "FLAD\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u7684LLM\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e91-\u8fb9-\u8f66\u534f\u540c\u67b6\u6784\u89e3\u51b3\u6570\u636e\u9690\u79c1\u548c\u901a\u4fe1\u5ef6\u8fdf\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u6570\u636e\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3LLM\u5728\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u4e2d\u8bad\u7ec3\u9762\u4e34\u7684\u9ad8\u8ba1\u7b97\u4f20\u8f93\u6210\u672c\u3001\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u7b49\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u5b9e\u73b0\u8f66\u8f86\u95f4\u534f\u4f5c\u8bad\u7ec3\u800c\u4e0d\u5171\u4eab\u539f\u59cb\u6570\u636e\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u4e91-\u8fb9-\u8f66\u534f\u540c\u67b6\u6784\u3001\u667a\u80fd\u5e76\u884c\u5316\u534f\u4f5c\u8bad\u7ec3\u673a\u5236\u548c\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728NVIDIA Jetsons\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5e73\u53f0\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u539f\u578b\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc4\u4f30\u8868\u660eFLAD\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4f18\u8d8a\u7684\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u9ad8\u6548\u5229\u7528\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u8f66\u8f86\u8d44\u6e90\u3002", "conclusion": "FLAD\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u534f\u4f5c\u5f0f\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u77e5\u8bc6\u5171\u4eab\u5f00\u8f9f\u4e86\u65b0\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u3002"}}

However, the representation spaces of modern PLMs are highly non--linear and geometrically structured, where textual embeddings reside on curved semantic manifolds rather than flat Euclidean spaces. Linear aggregation on such manifolds inevitably distorts geometry and causes semantic drift--a phenomenon where aggregated representations deviate from the intrinsic manifold, losing semantic fidelity and expressive power. To quantitatively investigate this problem, this work introduces a local PCA--based metric that measures the degree of semantic drift and provides the first quantitative framework to analyze how different aggregation mechanisms affect manifold structure. Building upon these insights, we propose Geodesic Aggregation, a manifold--aware mechanism that aggregates neighbor information along geodesics via log--exp mappings on the unit sphere, ensuring that representations remain faithful to the semantic manifold during message passing. We further develop GeoGNN, a practical instantiation that integrates spherical attention with manifold interpolation. Extensive experiments across four benchmark datasets and multiple text encoders show that GeoGNN substantially mitigates semantic drift and consistently outperforms strong baselines, establishing the importance of manifold--aware aggregation in text--attributed graph learning.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faGeoGNN\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u5728\u6587\u672c\u5c5e\u6027\u56fe\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u6d41\u5f62\u611f\u77e5\u805a\u5408\u7684\u56fe\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6d4b\u5730\u7ebf\u805a\u5408\u673a\u5236\u89e3\u51b3\u4f20\u7edf\u7ebf\u6027\u805a\u5408\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u6f02\u79fb\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709GNN\u5728\u6587\u672c\u5c5e\u6027\u56fe\u4e0a\u4f7f\u7528\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7f16\u7801\u6587\u672c\u65f6\uff0c\u7531\u4e8ePLM\u8868\u793a\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u9ad8\u5ea6\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u548c\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u7ebf\u6027\u805a\u5408\u4f1a\u626d\u66f2\u6d41\u5f62\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u8bed\u4e49\u6f02\u79fb\u548c\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\u4e0b\u964d\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u5c40\u90e8PCA\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u6f02\u79fb\u5ea6\u91cf\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6d4b\u5730\u7ebf\u805a\u5408\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5355\u4f4d\u7403\u9762\u4e0a\u7684\u5bf9\u6570-\u6307\u6570\u6620\u5c04\u6cbf\u6d4b\u5730\u7ebf\u805a\u5408\u90bb\u5c45\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u8868\u793a\u5728\u6d88\u606f\u4f20\u9012\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u4fdd\u6301\u8bed\u4e49\u6d41\u5f62\u5fe0\u5b9e\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u56db\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u591a\u79cd\u6587\u672c\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cGeoGNN\u663e\u8457\u7f13\u89e3\u4e86\u8bed\u4e49\u6f02\u79fb\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u6301\u7eed\u4f18\u4e8e\u5f3a\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6d41\u5f62\u611f\u77e5\u805a\u5408\u5728\u6587\u672c\u5c5e\u6027\u56fe\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u6027\uff0cGeoGNN\u4e3a\u5904\u7406\u8bed\u4e49\u6d41\u5f62\u4e0a\u7684\u56fe\u5b66\u4e60\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Unlike the Euclidean distance of numerical attributes, the categorical attributes lack well-defined relationships of their possible values (also called categories interchangeably), which hampers the exploration of compact categorical data clusters. Although most attempts are made for developing appropriate distance metrics, they typically assume a fixed topological relationship between categories when learning distance metrics, which limits their adaptability to varying cluster structures and often leads to suboptimal clustering performance. This paper, therefore, breaks the intrinsic relationship tie of attribute categories and learns customized distance metrics suitable for flexibly and accurately revealing various cluster distributions. As a result, the fitting ability of the clustering algorithm is significantly enhanced, benefiting from the learnable category relationships. Moreover, the learned category relationships are proved to be Euclidean distance metric-compatible, enabling a seamless extension to mixed datasets that include both numerical and categorical attributes.

However, the VLM-generated labels exhibit dual limitations: low quality (i.e., label noise) and absence of error correction mechanisms. To enhance label quality, we propose Human-Corrected Labels (HCLs), a novel setting that efficient human correction for VLM-generated noisy labels. As shown in Figure 1(b), HCL strategically deploys human correction only for instances with VLM discrepancies, achieving both higher-quality annotations and reduced labor costs. Specifically, we theoretically derive a risk-consistent estimator that incorporates both human-corrected labels and VLM predictions to train classifiers. Besides, we further propose a conditional probability method to estimate the label distribution using a combination of VLM outputs and model predictions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves superior classification performance and is robust to label noise, validating the effectiveness of HCL in practical weak supervision scenarios.

For large sparse matrices, they will increase the memory usage and computational time, and be reduced through proper row or column arrangement, namely matrix reordering. Finding a row or column permutation with the minimal fill-ins is NP-hard, and surrogate objectives are designed to derive fill-in reduction permutations or learn a reordering function. However, there is no theoretical guarantee between the golden criterion and these surrogate objectives. Here we propose to learn a reordering network by minimizing \\(l_1\\) norm of triangular factors of the reordered matrix to approximate the exact number of fill-ins. The reordering network utilizes a graph encoder to predict row or column node scores. For inference, it is easy and fast to derive the permutation from sorting algorithms for matrices. For gradient based optimization, there is a large gap between the predicted node scores and resultant triangular factors in the optimization objective. To bridge the gap, we first design two reparameterization techniques to obtain the permutation matrix from node scores. The matrix is reordered by multiplying the permutation matrix. Then we introduce the factorization process into the objective function to arrive at target triangular factors. The overall objective function is optimized with the alternating direction method of multipliers and proximal gradient descent.

We formulate this as a convex optimization problem with linear constraints, deriving lower and upper bounds on the minimum attack cost. As a byproduct of this theoretical analysis, we show that any existing label-flipping attack can be post-processed via our proposed method to reduce the number of label flips required while preserving the intended poisoning effect.

To be published in the Proceedings of Machine Learning Research (PMLR)", "summary": "Recent advances in deep reinforcement learning for autonomous cyber defence have resulted in agents that can successfully defend simulated computer networks against cyber-attacks. However, many of these agents would need retraining to defend networks with differing topology or size, making them poorly suited to real-world networks where topology and size can vary over time. In this research we introduce a novel set of Topological Extensions for Reinforcement Learning Agents (TERLA) that provide generalisability for the defence of networks with differing topology and size, without the need for retraining. Our approach involves the use of heterogeneous graph neural network layers to produce a fixed-size latent embedding representing the observed network state. This representation learning stage is coupled with a reduced, fixed-size, semantically meaningful and interpretable action space. We apply TERLA to a standard deep reinforcement learning Proximal Policy Optimisation (PPO) agent model, and to reduce the sim-to-real gap, conduct our research using Cyber Autonomy Gym for Experimentation (CAGE) Challenge 4.

TERLA agents retain the defensive performance of vanilla PPO agents whilst showing improved action efficiency.

In this paper, we tackle a particularly challenging class imbalance problem in multi-view scenarios: long-tailed classification. We propose TMLC, a Trusted Multi-view Long-tailed Classification framework, which makes contributions on two critical aspects: opinion aggregation and pseudo-data generation. Specifically, inspired by Social Identity Theory, we design a group consensus opinion aggregation mechanism that guides decision making toward the direction favored by the majority of the group. In terms of pseudo-data generation, we introduce a novel distance metric to adapt SMOTE for multi-view scenarios and develop an uncertainty-guided data generation module that produces high-quality pseudo-data, effectively mitigating the adverse effects of class imbalance. Extensive experiments on long-tailed multi-view datasets demonstrate that our model is capable of achieving superior performance.

While prior research has introduced various uncertainty bounds, most existing approaches require access to specific input features and rely on posterior mean and variance estimates or tuning hyperparameters. These limitations hinder robustness and fail to capture the model's global behavior in expectation. To address these limitations, we propose a chaining-based framework for estimating upper and lower bounds on the expected extreme values over unseen data, without requiring access to specific input locations. We provide kernel-specific refinements for commonly used kernels such as RBF and Mat\u00e9rn, in which our bounds are tighter than generic constructions. We further improve numerical tightness by avoiding analytical relaxations. In addition to global estimation, we also develop a novel method for local uncertainty quantification at specified inputs. This approach leverages chaining geometry through partition diameters, adapting to local structure without relying on posterior variance scaling.

It helps reduce noise, improve generalization, and enhance interpretability. However, most existing unsupervised FS methods evaluate features in isolation, even though informative signals often emerge from groups of related features. For example, adjacent pixels, functionally connected brain regions, or correlated financial indicators tend to act together, making independent evaluation suboptimal. Although some methods attempt to capture group structure, they typically rely on predefined partitions or label supervision, limiting their applicability. We propose GroupFS, an end-to-end, fully differentiable framework that jointly discovers latent feature groups and selects the most informative groups among them, without relying on fixed a priori groups or label supervision. GroupFS enforces Laplacian smoothness on both feature and sample graphs and applies a group sparsity regularizer to learn a compact, structured representation. Across nine benchmarks spanning images, tabular data, and biological datasets, GroupFS consistently outperforms state-of-the-art unsupervised FS in clustering and selects groups of features that align with meaningful patterns.", "AI": {"tldr": "GroupFS\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u7684\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u7279\u5f81\u9009\u62e9\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u8054\u5408\u53d1\u73b0\u6f5c\u5728\u7279\u5f81\u7ec4\u5e76\u4ece\u4e2d\u9009\u62e9\u6700\u4fe1\u606f\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u7ec4\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u4f9d\u8d56\u9884\u5b9a\u4e49\u5206\u7ec4\u6216\u6807\u7b7e\u76d1\u7763\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u7279\u5f81\u9009\u62e9\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u5355\u72ec\u8bc4\u4f30\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u4f46\u4fe1\u606f\u4fe1\u53f7\u5f80\u5f80\u6765\u81ea\u76f8\u5173\u7279\u5f81\u7ec4\u3002\u867d\u7136\u4e00\u4e9b\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c1d\u8bd5\u6355\u6349\u7ec4\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u4f46\u901a\u5e38\u4f9d\u8d56\u9884\u5b9a\u4e49\u5206\u533a\u6216\u6807\u7b7e\u76d1\u7763\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u9002\u7528\u6027\u3002", "method": "GroupFS\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u5b8c\u5168\u53ef\u5fae\u5206\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5728\u7279\u5f81\u56fe\u548c\u6837\u672c\u56fe\u4e0a\u5f3a\u5236\u6267\u884c\u62c9\u666e\u62c9\u65af\u5e73\u6ed1\uff0c\u5e76\u5e94\u7528\u7ec4\u7a00\u758f\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u5668\u6765\u5b66\u4e60\u7d27\u51d1\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u8868\u793a\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e5d\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff08\u5305\u62ec\u56fe\u50cf\u3001\u8868\u683c\u6570\u636e\u548c\u751f\u7269\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff09\uff0cGroupFS\u5728\u805a\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u59cb\u7ec8\u4f18\u4e8e\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u7279\u5f81\u9009\u62e9\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u9009\u62e9\u51fa\u4e0e\u6709\u610f\u4e49\u6a21\u5f0f\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u7ec4\u3002", "conclusion": "GroupFS\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u53d1\u73b0\u548c\u9009\u62e9\u6709\u610f\u4e49\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u7ec4\uff0c\u5728\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u7279\u5f81\u9009\u62e9\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u4e14\u4e0d\u4f9d\u8d56\u9884\u5b9a\u4e49\u5206\u7ec4\u6216\u76d1\u7763\u4fe1\u606f\u3002"}}

To avoid catastrophic forgetting, we need to build compact memory of essential past knowledge, but no clear solution has yet emerged, even for shallow neural networks with just one or two layers. In this paper, we present a new method to build compact memory for logistic regression. Our method is based on a result by Khan and Swaroop [2021] who show the existence of optimal memory for such models. We formulate the search for the optimal memory as Hessian-matching and propose a probabilistic PCA method to estimate them. Our approach can drastically improve accuracy compared to Experience Replay. For instance, on Split-ImageNet, we get 60% accuracy compared to 30% obtained by replay with memory-size equivalent to 0.3% of the data size. Increasing the memory size to 2% further boosts the accuracy to 74%, closing the gap to the batch accuracy of 77.6% on this task.

Existing cross-domain policy adaptation methods typically rely on a single simple filtering criterion to select source trajectory fragments and stitch them together. They match either state structure or action feasibility. However, the selected fragments still have poor stitchability: state structures can misalign, the return-to-go (RTG) becomes incomparable when the reward or horizon changes, and actions may jump at trajectory junctions. As a result, RTG tokens lose continuity, which compromises DT's inference ability. To tackle these challenges, we propose Data Fusion-Enhanced Decision Transformer (DFDT), a compact pipeline that restores stitchability. Particularly, DFDT fuses scarce target data with selectively trusted source fragments via a two-level data filter, maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) mismatch for state-structure alignment, and optimal transport (OT) deviation for action feasibility. It then trains on a feasibility-weighted fusion distribution. Furthermore, DFDT replaces RTG tokens with advantage-conditioned tokens, which improves the continuity of the semantics in the token sequence. It also applies a $Q$-guided regularizer to suppress junction value and action jumps. Theoretically, we provide bounds that tie state value and policy performance gaps to the MMD-mismatch and OT-deviation measures, and show that the bounds tighten as these two measures shrink. We show that DFDT improves return and stability over strong offline RL and sequence-model baselines across gravity, kinematic, and morphology shifts on D4RL-style control tasks, and further corroborate these gains with token-stitching and sequence-semantics stability analyses.", "AI": {"tldr": "DFDT\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u7ea7\u6570\u636e\u8fc7\u6ee4\u548c\u4f18\u52bf\u6761\u4ef6\u5316\u4ee4\u724c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u51b3\u7b56\u53d8\u6362\u5668\u5728\u8de8\u57df\u9002\u5e94\u4e2d\u7684\u8f68\u8ff9\u7247\u6bb5\u62fc\u63a5\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u7b56\u7565\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u51b3\u7b56\u53d8\u6362\u5668\u5728\u8de8\u57df\u9002\u5e94\u4e2d\u8f68\u8ff9\u7247\u6bb5\u62fc\u63a5\u6027\u5dee\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u72b6\u6001\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0d\u5bf9\u9f50\u3001RTG\u4e0d\u53ef\u6bd4\u4ee5\u53ca\u52a8\u4f5c\u5728\u8fde\u63a5\u70b9\u8df3\u8dc3\u7b49\u6311\u6218", "method": "\u63d0\u51faDFDT\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1\uff09\u4f7f\u7528MMD\u548cOT\u4e24\u7ea7\u8fc7\u6ee4\u5668\u9009\u62e9\u53ef\u4fe1\u6e90\u8f68\u8ff9\u7247\u6bb5\uff1b2\uff09\u7528\u4f18\u52bf\u6761\u4ef6\u5316\u4ee4\u724c\u66ff\u4ee3RTG\u4ee4\u724c\uff1b3\uff09\u5e94\u7528Q\u5f15\u5bfc\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u5668\u6291\u5236\u8fde\u63a5\u70b9\u8df3\u8dc3", "result": "\u5728\u91cd\u529b\u3001\u8fd0\u52a8\u5b66\u548c\u5f62\u6001\u5b66\u53d8\u5316\u7684D4RL\u63a7\u5236\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0cDFDT\u76f8\u6bd4\u5f3a\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u56de\u62a5\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u5747\u6709\u63d0\u5347", "conclusion": "DFDT\u901a\u8fc7\u6570\u636e\u878d\u5408\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u8fde\u7eed\u6027\u6539\u8fdb\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u8de8\u57df\u9002\u5e94\u4e2d\u7684\u8f68\u8ff9\u62fc\u63a5\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u548c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027"}}

HPO algorithms from the Population Based Training (PBT) family are efficient thanks to dynamically adjusting HPs every few steps of the weight optimization. Recent results indicate that the number of steps between HP updates is an important meta-HP of all PBT variants that can substantially affect their performance. Yet, no method or intuition is available for efficiently setting its value. We introduce Iterated Population Based Training (IPBT), a novel PBT variant that automatically adjusts this HP via restarts that reuse weight information in a task-agnostic way and leverage time-varying Bayesian optimization to reinitialize HPs. Evaluation on 8 image classification and reinforcement learning tasks shows that, on average, our algorithm matches or outperforms 5 previous PBT variants and other HPO algorithms (random search, ASHA, SMAC3), without requiring a budget increase or any changes to its HPs.

To prevent illicit use, it is desirable to be able to detect AI-generated text. Training and evaluation of such detectors critically depend on suitable benchmark datasets. Several groups took on the tedious work of collecting, curating, and publishing large and diverse datasets for this task. However, it remains an open challenge to ensure high quality in all relevant aspects of such a dataset. For example, the DetectRL benchmark exhibits relatively simple patterns of AI-generation in 98.5% of the Claude-LLM data. These patterns may include introductory words such as \"Sure! Here is the academic article abstract:\", or instances where the LLM rejects the prompted task. In this work, we demonstrate that detectors trained on such data use such patterns as shortcuts, which facilitates spoofing attacks on the trained detectors. We consequently reprocessed the DetectRL dataset with several cleansing operations. Experiments show that such data cleansing makes direct attacks more difficult.

Recently, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have shown promise in accelerating MILP solvers by predicting high-quality solutions. However, we identify that existing methods misalign with the intrinsic structure of MILP problems at two levels. At the leaning objective level, the Binary Cross-Entropy (BCE) loss treats variables independently, neglecting their relative priority and yielding plausible logits. At the model architecture level, standard GNN message passing inherently smooths the representations across variables, missing the natural competitive relationships within constraints. To address these challenges, we propose CoCo-MILP, which explicitly models inter-variable Contrast and intra-constraint Competition for advanced MILP solution prediction. At the objective level, CoCo-MILP introduces the Inter-Variable Contrastive Loss (VCL), which explicitly maximizes the embedding margin between variables assigned one versus zero. At the architectural level, we design an Intra-Constraint Competitive GNN layer that, instead of homogenizing features, learns to differentiate representations of competing variables within a constraint, capturing their exclusionary nature. Experimental results on standard benchmarks demonstrate that CoCo-MILP significantly outperforms existing learning-based approaches, reducing the solution gap by up to 68.12% compared to traditional solvers.

To address this long-standing challenge, we propose a novel and fully parameter-free clustering framework via Self-supervised Consensus Maximization, named SCMax. Our framework performs hierarchical agglomerative clustering and cluster evaluation in a single, integrated process. At each step of agglomeration, it creates a new, structure-aware data representation through a self-supervised learning task guided by the current clustering structure.

Here we extend the Feynman-Kac (FK) steering framework, an inference-time control approach, to diffusion-based protein design. By coupling FK steering with structure generation, the method guides sampling toward desirable structural or energetic features while maintaining the diversity of the underlying diffusion process. To enable simultaneous generation of both sequence and structure properties, rewards are computed on models refined through ProteinMPNN and all-atom relaxation. Applied to binder design, FK steering consistently improves predicted interface energetics across diverse targets with minimal computational overhead.

While extensive studies have examined attacks targeting either objective, strategies that simultaneously degrade both utility and fairness remain largely unexplored.

Two variants, Synchronous DFA (S-DFA) and Split DFA (Sp-DFA), are further proposed to capture distinct real-world collusion scenarios. Experimental results show that existing robust FL defenses, including hybrid aggregation schemes, fail to resist DFAs effectively. To counter these threats, we propose GuardFed, a self-adaptive defense framework that maintains a fairness-aware reference model using a small amount of clean server data augmented with synthetic samples. In each training round, GuardFed computes a dual-perspective trust score for every client by jointly evaluating its utility deviation and fairness degradation, thereby enabling selective aggregation of trustworthy updates.

To alleviate this problem, methods in the field of explainable Artificial Intelligence try to unveil how such automated decisions are made. But explainable AI methods are often plagued by missing faithfulness/correctness, meaning that they sometimes provide explanations that do not align with the neural network's decision and logic. Recently, transformations to decision trees have been proposed to overcome such problems. Unfortunately, they typically lack exactness, scalability, or interpretability as the size of the neural network grows. Thus, we generalize these previous results, especially by considering convolutional neural networks, recurrent neural networks, non-ReLU activation functions, and bias terms. Our findings are accompanied by rigorous proofs and we present a novel algorithm RENTT (Runtime Efficient Network to Tree Transformation) designed to compute an exact equivalent decision tree representation of neural networks in a manner that is both runtime and memory efficient. The resulting decision trees are multivariate and thus, possibly too complex to understand. To alleviate this problem, we also provide a method to calculate the ground truth feature importance for neural networks via the equivalent decision trees - for entire models (global), specific input regions (regional), or single decisions (local). All theoretical results are supported by detailed numerical experiments that emphasize two key aspects: the computational efficiency and scalability of our algorithm, and that only RENTT succeeds in uncovering ground truth explanations compared to conventional approximation methods like LIME and SHAP.

Conventional solutions for this problem incorporate quantum-inspired neural networks with Kronecker products and hybrid tensor neural networks with MPO factorization and fully-connected layers. Nonetheless, the generalization power and robustness of the fully-connected layers are not as outstanding as circuit models in quantum computing. In this paper, we propose a novel tensor circuit neural network (TCNN) that takes advantage of the characteristics of tensor neural networks and residual circuit models to achieve generalization ability and robustness with low complexity. The proposed activation operation and parallelism of the circuit in complex number field improves its non-linearity and efficiency for feature learning. Moreover, since the feature information exists in the parameters in both the real and imaginary parts in TCNN, an information fusion layer is proposed for merging features stored in those parameters to enhance the generalization capability. Experimental results confirm that TCNN showcases more outstanding generalization and robustness with its average accuracies on various datasets 2\\%-3\\% higher than those of the state-of-the-art compared models. More significantly, while other models fail to learn features under noise parameter attacking, TCNN still showcases prominent learning capability owing to its ability to prevent gradient explosion.

However, this scaling paradigm incurs substantial memory overhead, creating significant challenges for both training and inference. While existing research has primarily addressed parameter and optimizer state memory reduction, activation memory-particularly from feed-forward networks (FFNs)-has become the critical bottleneck, especially when FlashAttention is implemented. In this work, we conduct a detailed memory profiling of LLMs and identify FFN activations as the predominant source to activation memory overhead. Motivated by this, we introduce Mixture-of-Channels (MoC), a novel FFN architecture that selectively activates only the Top-K most relevant channels per token determined by SwiGLU's native gating mechanism. MoC substantially reduces activation memory during pre-training and improves inference efficiency by reducing memory access through partial weight loading into GPU SRAM. Extensive experiments validate that MoC delivers significant memory savings and throughput gains while maintaining competitive model performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86Mixture-of-Channels (MoC)\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u6fc0\u6d3bFFN\u4e2d\u7684Top-K\u901a\u9053\u6765\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u6fc0\u6d3b\u5185\u5b58\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3LLM\u4e2dFFN\u6fc0\u6d3b\u5185\u5b58\u6210\u4e3a\u74f6\u9888\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740LLM\u89c4\u6a21\u6269\u5927\uff0cFFN\u6fc0\u6d3b\u5185\u5b58\u6210\u4e3a\u5173\u952e\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u4f7f\u7528FlashAttention\u540e\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u53c2\u6570\u548c\u4f18\u5316\u5668\u72b6\u6001\u7684\u5185\u5b58\u51cf\u5c11\uff0c\u800c\u6fc0\u6d3b\u5185\u5b58\u95ee\u9898\u5c1a\u672a\u5145\u5206\u89e3\u51b3\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faMoC\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u5229\u7528SwiGLU\u7684\u5929\u7136\u95e8\u63a7\u673a\u5236\u4e3a\u6bcf\u4e2atoken\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u5730\u6fc0\u6d3bTop-K\u6700\u76f8\u5173\u901a\u9053\uff0c\u5728\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u51cf\u5c11\u6fc0\u6d3b\u5185\u5b58\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u90e8\u5206\u6743\u91cd\u52a0\u8f7d\u5230GPU SRAM\u63d0\u9ad8\u63a8\u7406\u6548\u7387\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1MoC\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u8282\u7701\u5185\u5b58\u5e76\u63d0\u9ad8\u541e\u5410\u91cf\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "MoC\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u7684FFN\u67b6\u6784\u521b\u65b0\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u4e0d\u727a\u7272\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11LLM\u7684\u6fc0\u6d3b\u5185\u5b58\u5f00\u9500\u3002"}}

In MARBLE, each arm evolves according to a latent environment state that switches over time, making policy learning substantially more challenging.

This document is the extended version which includes the appendix", "summary": "The proliferation of complex, black-box AI models has intensified the need for techniques that can explain their decisions. Feature attribution methods have become a popular solution for providing post-hoc explanations, yet the field has historically lacked a formal problem definition. This paper addresses this gap by introducing a formal definition for the problem of feature attribution, which stipulates that explanations be supported by an underlying probability distribution represented by the given dataset. Our analysis reveals that many existing model-agnostic methods fail to meet this criterion, while even those that do often possess other limitations. To overcome these challenges, we propose Distributional Feature Attribution eXplanations (DFAX), a novel, model-agnostic method for feature attribution. DFAX is the first feature attribution method to explain classifier predictions directly based on the data distribution.

It is widely used in finance, advertising, medicine, and other domains. Two main approaches to SHAP calculation exist: Path-Dependent SHAP, which leverages the tree structure for efficiency, and Background SHAP, which uses a background dataset to estimate feature distributions.\n  We introduce WOODELF, a SHAP algorithm that integrates decision trees, game theory, and Boolean logic into a unified framework. For each consumer, WOODELF constructs a pseudo-Boolean formula that captures their feature values, the structure of the decision tree ensemble, and the entire background dataset. It then leverages this representation to compute Background SHAP in linear time. WOODELF can also compute Path-Dependent SHAP, Shapley interaction values, Banzhaf values, and Banzhaf interaction values.\n  WOODELF is designed to run efficiently on CPU and GPU hardware alike. Available via the WOODELF Python package, it is implemented using NumPy, SciPy, and CuPy without relying on custom C++ or CUDA code. This design enables fast performance and seamless integration into existing frameworks, supporting large-scale computation of SHAP and other game-theoretic values in practice.\n  For example, on a dataset with 3,000,000 rows, 5,000,000 background samples, and 127 features, WOODELF computed all Background Shapley values in 162 seconds on CPU and 16 seconds on GPU - compared to 44 minutes required by the best method on any hardware platform, representing 16x and 165x speedups, respectively.", "AI": {"tldr": "WOODELF\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u7684SHAP\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u51b3\u7b56\u6811\u3001\u535a\u5f08\u8bba\u548c\u5e03\u5c14\u903b\u8f91\u6574\u5408\u5230\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\u4e2d\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u7ebf\u6027\u65f6\u95f4\u8ba1\u7b97\u80cc\u666fSHAP\u503c\uff0c\u5728CPU\u548cGPU\u4e0a\u90fd\u80fd\u9ad8\u6548\u8fd0\u884c\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e8616-165\u500d\u7684\u52a0\u901f\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684SHAP\u8ba1\u7b97\u65b9\u6cd5\u6548\u7387\u8f83\u4f4e\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u5904\u7406\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u65f6\u3002WOODELF\u65e8\u5728\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e00\u79cd\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684SHAP\u8ba1\u7b97\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u786c\u4ef6\u5e73\u53f0\u4e0a\u5feb\u901f\u8ba1\u7b97\u5404\u79cd\u535a\u5f08\u8bba\u503c\u3002", "method": "WOODELF\u4e3a\u6bcf\u4e2a\u6d88\u8d39\u8005\u6784\u5efa\u4e00\u4e2a\u4f2a\u5e03\u5c14\u516c\u5f0f\uff0c\u6355\u6349\u7279\u5f81\u503c\u3001\u51b3\u7b56\u6811\u96c6\u6210\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u6574\u4e2a\u80cc\u666f\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u5229\u7528\u8fd9\u79cd\u8868\u793a\u5728\u7ebf\u6027\u65f6\u95f4\u5185\u8ba1\u7b97\u80cc\u666fSHAP\u503c\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u8fd8\u652f\u6301\u8def\u5f84\u4f9d\u8d56SHAP\u3001Shapley\u4ea4\u4e92\u503c\u3001Banzhaf\u503c\u7b49\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5305\u542b300\u4e07\u884c\u3001500\u4e07\u80cc\u666f\u6837\u672c\u548c127\u4e2a\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cWOODELF\u5728CPU\u4e0a\u8ba1\u7b97\u6240\u6709\u80cc\u666fShapley\u503c\u8017\u65f6162\u79d2\uff0c\u5728GPU\u4e0a\u4ec5\u970016\u79d2\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u6700\u4f73\u65b9\u6cd5\u768444\u5206\u949f\uff0c\u5206\u522b\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e8616\u500d\u548c165\u500d\u7684\u52a0\u901f\u3002", "conclusion": "WOODELF\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u7edf\u4e00\u7684SHAP\u8ba1\u7b97\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6574\u5408\u51b3\u7b56\u6811\u3001\u535a\u5f08\u8bba\u548c\u5e03\u5c14\u903b\u8f91\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u5927\u89c4\u6a21SHAP\u503c\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u5e76\u5177\u6709\u826f\u597d\u7684\u786c\u4ef6\u517c\u5bb9\u6027\u3002"}}

Previous PPA methods suffer from two limitations, i.e., i) over-reliance on sequence horizon impact restricts fine-grained perturbations on item transitions, and ii) holistic modifications cause detectable distribution shifts. To address these challenges, we propose a constrained reinforcement driven attack CREAT that synergizes a bi-level optimization framework with multi-reward reinforcement learning to balance adversarial efficacy and stealthiness. We first develop a Pattern Balanced Rewarding Policy, which integrates pattern inversion rewards to invert critical patterns and distribution consistency rewards to minimize detectable shifts via unbalanced co-optimal transport.

In contrast, certifying models against training data perturbations remains a relatively under-explored area. These perturbations can arise in three critical contexts: adversarial data poisoning, where an adversary manipulates training samples to corrupt model performance; machine unlearning, which requires certifying model behavior under the removal of specific training data; and differential privacy, where guarantees must be given with respect to substituting individual data points. This work introduces Abstract Gradient Training (AGT), a unified framework for certifying robustness of a given model and training procedure to training data perturbations, including bounded perturbations, the removal of data points, and the addition of new samples. By bounding the reachable set of parameters, i.e., establishing provable parameter-space bounds, AGT provides a formal approach to analyzing the behavior of models trained via first-order optimization methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u62bd\u8c61\u68af\u5ea6\u8bad\u7ec3\uff08AGT\uff09\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8ba4\u8bc1\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u6270\u52a8\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u6709\u754c\u6270\u52a8\u3001\u6570\u636e\u70b9\u79fb\u9664\u548c\u65b0\u6837\u672c\u6dfb\u52a0\u3002", "motivation": "\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u6270\u52a8\uff08\u5982\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u6570\u636e\u6295\u6bd2\u3001\u673a\u5668\u9057\u5fd8\u3001\u5dee\u5206\u9690\u79c1\uff09\u7684\u8ba4\u8bc1\u7814\u7a76\u76f8\u5bf9\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u800c\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u6570\u636e\u6270\u52a8\u7684\u8ba4\u8bc1\u6280\u672f\u5df2\u8f83\u4e3a\u6210\u719f\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u8fb9\u754c\u53ef\u5230\u8fbe\u53c2\u6570\u96c6\uff08\u5efa\u7acb\u53ef\u8bc1\u660e\u7684\u53c2\u6570\u7a7a\u95f4\u8fb9\u754c\uff09\uff0cAGT\u4e3a\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e00\u9636\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u884c\u4e3a\u5206\u6790\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "AGT\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u8ba4\u8bc1\u7ed9\u5b9a\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\u7a0b\u5e8f\u5bf9\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u6270\u52a8\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "AGT\u586b\u8865\u4e86\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u6270\u52a8\u8ba4\u8bc1\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u7a7a\u767d\uff0c\u4e3a\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u6570\u636e\u6295\u6bd2\u3001\u673a\u5668\u9057\u5fd8\u548c\u5dee\u5206\u9690\u79c1\u7b49\u5173\u952e\u573a\u666f\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u8ba4\u8bc1\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

Recently, stringent privacy regulations such as GDPR and CCPA have introduced significant new challenges for existing spatio-temporal graph models, requiring complete unlearning of unauthorized data. Since each node in a spatio-temporal graph diffuses information globally across both spatial and temporal dimensions, existing unlearning methods primarily designed for static graphs and localized data removal cannot efficiently erase a single node without incurring costs nearly equivalent to full model retraining. Therefore, an effective approach for complete spatio-temporal graph unlearning is a pressing need. To address this, we propose CallosumNet, a divide-and-conquer spatio-temporal graph unlearning framework inspired by the corpus callosum structure that facilitates communication between the brain's two hemispheres. CallosumNet incorporates two novel techniques: (1) Enhanced Subgraph Construction (ESC), which adaptively constructs multiple localized subgraphs based on several factors, including biologically-inspired virtual ganglions; and (2) Global Ganglion Bridging (GGB), which reconstructs global spatio-temporal dependencies from these localized subgraphs, effectively restoring the full graph representation. Empirical results on four diverse real-world datasets show that CallosumNet achieves complete unlearning with only 1%-2% relative MAE loss compared to the gold model, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art baselines.

However, existing methods typically rely on retain data to constrain model behavior, which increases computational and energy burdens and conflicts with industrial data silos and privacy compliance requirements. To address this, we propose a novel retain-free unlearning framework, referred to as Probing then Editing (PTE). PTE frames unlearning as a probe-edit process: first, it probes the decision boundary neighborhood of the model on the to-be-forgotten class via gradient ascent and generates corresponding editing instructions using the model's own predictions. Subsequently, a push-pull collaborative optimization is performed: the push branch actively dismantles the decision region of the target class using the editing instructions, while the pull branch applies masked knowledge distillation to anchor the model's knowledge on retained classes to their original states. Benefiting from this mechanism, PTE achieves efficient and balanced knowledge editing using only the to-be-forgotten data and the original model. Experimental results demonstrate that PTE achieves an excellent balance between unlearning effectiveness and model utility across multiple general and industrial benchmarks such as CWRU and SCUT-FD.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aPTE\u7684\u514d\u4fdd\u7559\u9057\u5fd8\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u63a2\u6d4b-\u7f16\u8f91\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u77e5\u8bc6\u9057\u5fd8\uff0c\u4ec5\u9700\u9057\u5fd8\u6570\u636e\u548c\u539f\u59cb\u6a21\u578b\u5373\u53ef\u9ad8\u6548\u7f16\u8f91\u77e5\u8bc6\u8fb9\u754c\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u52a8\u6001\u5de5\u4e1a\u7269\u8054\u7f51\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u6a21\u578b\u9700\u8981\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u9057\u5fd8\u8fc7\u65f6\u6216\u9519\u8bef\u77e5\u8bc6\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u4fdd\u7559\u6570\u636e\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d1f\u62c5\u548c\u9690\u79c1\u5408\u89c4\u51b2\u7a81\u3002", "method": "PTE\u6846\u67b6\u5305\u542b\u4e24\u4e2a\u9636\u6bb5\uff1a1) \u901a\u8fc7\u68af\u5ea6\u4e0a\u5347\u63a2\u6d4b\u9057\u5fd8\u7c7b\u51b3\u7b56\u8fb9\u754c\u5e76\u751f\u6210\u7f16\u8f91\u6307\u4ee4\uff1b2) \u63a8-\u62c9\u534f\u540c\u4f18\u5316\uff1a\u63a8\u5206\u652f\u4e3b\u52a8\u62c6\u89e3\u76ee\u6807\u7c7b\u51b3\u7b56\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u62c9\u5206\u652f\u901a\u8fc7\u63a9\u7801\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u951a\u5b9a\u4fdd\u7559\u7c7b\u77e5\u8bc6\u3002", "result": "\u5728CWRU\u548cSCUT-FD\u7b49\u591a\u4e2a\u901a\u7528\u548c\u5de5\u4e1a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cPTE\u5728\u9057\u5fd8\u6548\u679c\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u6548\u7528\u4e4b\u95f4\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u826f\u597d\u5e73\u8861\u3002", "conclusion": "PTE\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u5e73\u8861\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u7f16\u8f91\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ec5\u9700\u9057\u5fd8\u6570\u636e\u548c\u539f\u59cb\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5de5\u4e1a\u7269\u8054\u7f51\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u77e5\u8bc6\u7ba1\u7406\u9700\u6c42\u3002"}}

We find that a single transformer model trained on millions of programs is able to generalize across symbolic regression problems of varying dimension. Evaluated on 24 real-world and synthetic datasets, TSGP significantly outperforms standard GP, SLIM_GSGP, Deep Symbolic Regression, and Denoising Autoencoder GP, achieving an average rank of 1.58 across all benchmarks.

More precisely, after having introduced the feature error measure (FEM) to characterize the quality of the learned feature, we show that the FEM is decreasing during the training process of several concrete adaptive feature models including linear regression, single/multiple index models, etc. We believe that this hints at the potential successes of the adaptive feature program.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u8fc7\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u5e8f\u5217\u6a21\u578b\u7b80\u5316\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7279\u5f81\u7a0b\u5e8f\u8bad\u7ec3\u52a8\u6001\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u7279\u5f81\u8bef\u5dee\u5ea6\u91cf(FEM)\u6765\u8bc4\u4f30\u5b66\u4e60\u7279\u5f81\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc1\u660e\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7279\u5f81\u6a21\u578b\u4e2dFEM\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u9012\u51cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7d22\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u7406\u8bba\u4f18\u52bf\u662fAI\u65f6\u4ee3\u6700\u5177\u6311\u6218\u6027\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u4e4b\u4e00\u3002\u53d7Le Cam\u7b49\u4ef7\u6027\u542f\u53d1\uff0c\u4f5c\u8005\u5e0c\u671b\u901a\u8fc7\u8fc7\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u5e8f\u5217\u6a21\u578b\u7b80\u5316\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7279\u5f81\u7a0b\u5e8f\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u52a8\u6001\u5206\u6790\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u7279\u5f81\u8bef\u5dee\u5ea6\u91cf(FEM)\u6765\u8868\u5f81\u5b66\u4e60\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u7ebf\u6027\u56de\u5f52\u3001\u5355/\u591a\u6307\u6807\u6a21\u578b\u7b49\u5177\u4f53\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7279\u5f81\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7279\u5f81\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\uff0c\u7279\u5f81\u8bef\u5dee\u5ea6\u91cf(FEM)\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u5448\u73b0\u9012\u51cf\u8d8b\u52bf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7ed3\u679c\u4e3a\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7279\u5f81\u7a0b\u5e8f\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u6210\u529f\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u652f\u6301\u6027\u8bc1\u636e\uff0c\u6697\u793a\u4e86\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u65b9\u5411\u7684\u524d\u666f\u3002"}}

We show that incorporating such group symmetries into the SAEs yields features more useful in downstream tasks. More specifically, we train autoencoders on synthetic images and find that a single matrix can explain how their activations transform as the images are rotated.

This study assesses the performance of statistical, machine learning (ML), and deep learning (DL) models in forecasting traffic speed and flow using real-world data from California's Harbor Freeway, sourced from the Caltrans Performance Measurement System (PeMS). Each model was evaluated over 20 forecasting windows (up to 1 hour 40 minutes) using RMSE, MAE, and R-Square metrics. Results show ANFIS-GP performs best at early windows with RMSE of 0.038, MAE of 0.0276, and R-Square of 0.9983, while Bi-LSTM is more robust for medium-term prediction due to its capacity to model long-range temporal dependencies, achieving RMSE of 0.1863, MAE of 0.0833, and R-Square of 0.987 at a forecasting of 20. The degradation in model performance was quantified using logarithmic transformation, with slope values used to measure robustness. Among DL models, Bi-LSTM had the flattest slope (0.0454 RMSE, 0.0545 MAE for flow), whereas ANFIS-GP had 0.1058 for RMSE and 0.1037 for flow MAE.

However, most existing data-driven methods used for SEP predictions are operated as black-box models, making it challenging for solar physicists to interpret the results and understand the underlying physical causes of such events rather than just obtain a prediction. To address this challenge, we propose a novel framework that integrates global explanations and ad-hoc feature mapping to enhance model transparency and provide deeper insights into the decision-making process. We validate our approach using a dataset of 341 SEP events, including 244 significant (>=10 MeV) proton events exceeding the Space Weather Prediction Center S1 threshold, spanning solar cycles 22, 23, and 24. Furthermore, we present an explainability-focused case study of major SEP events, demonstrating how our method improves explainability and facilitates a more physics-informed understanding of SEP event prediction.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u96c6\u6210\u5168\u5c40\u89e3\u91ca\u548c\u7279\u8bbe\u7279\u5f81\u6620\u5c04\u7684\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u589e\u5f3a\u592a\u9633\u9ad8\u80fd\u7c92\u5b50\u4e8b\u4ef6\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u9ed1\u76d2\u6a21\u578b\u96be\u4ee5\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u592a\u9633\u9ad8\u80fd\u7c92\u5b50\u4e8b\u4ef6\u9884\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u591a\u4e3a\u9ed1\u76d2\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u89e3\u91ca\u7ed3\u679c\u80cc\u540e\u7684\u7269\u7406\u539f\u56e0\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u592a\u9633\u7269\u7406\u5b66\u5bb6\u5bf9\u4e8b\u4ef6\u672c\u8d28\u7684\u7406\u89e3\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u96c6\u6210\u5168\u5c40\u89e3\u91ca\u548c\u7279\u8bbe\u7279\u5f81\u6620\u5c04\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528341\u4e2aSEP\u4e8b\u4ef6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff08\u5305\u62ec244\u4e2a\u91cd\u8981\u8d28\u5b50\u4e8b\u4ef6\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u6db5\u76d6\u592a\u9633\u5468\u671f22\u300123\u548c24\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u4e3b\u8981SEP\u4e8b\u4ef6\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u6848\u4f8b\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\uff0c\u4fc3\u8fdb\u4e86\u5bf9SEP\u4e8b\u4ef6\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u7269\u7406\u7406\u89e3\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u6210\u529f\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u592a\u9633\u9ad8\u80fd\u7c92\u5b50\u4e8b\u4ef6\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\uff0c\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u6b64\u7c7b\u4e8b\u4ef6\u7684\u7269\u7406\u673a\u5236\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u6df1\u5165\u7684\u89c1\u89e3\u3002"}}

Rather than training policies or value heads, we investigate whether planning can be carried out directly in an evaluation-aligned embedding space. We introduce SOLIS, which learns such a space using supervised contrastive learning. In this representation, outcome similarity is captured by proximity, and a single global advantage vector orients the space from losing to winning regions. Candidate actions are then ranked according to their alignment with this direction, reducing planning to vector operations in latent space. We demonstrate this approach in chess, where SOLIS uses only a shallow search guided by the learned embedding to reach competitive strength under constrained conditions.

To address these issues, we propose AdaCuRL, a Adaptive Curriculum Reinforcement Learning framework that integrates coarse-to-fine difficulty estimation with adaptive curriculum scheduling. This approach dynamically aligns data difficulty with model capability and incorporates a data revisitation mechanism to mitigate catastrophic forgetting.

Current Rehearsal-based CL methods typically construct the memory buffer by selecting a representative subset (referred to as coresets), aiming to approximate the training efficacy of the full dataset with minimal storage overhead. However, mainstream Coreset Selection (CS) methods generally formulate the CS problem as a bi-level optimization problem that relies on numerous inner and outer iterations to solve, leading to substantial computational cost thus limiting their practical efficiency. In this paper, we aim to provide a more efficient selection logic and scheme for coreset construction. To this end, we first analyze the Mean Squared Error (MSE) between the buffer-trained model and the Bayes-optimal model through the perspective of localized error decomposition to investigate the contribution of samples from different regions to MSE suppression. Further theoretical and experimental analyses demonstrate that samples with high probability density play a dominant role in error suppression. Inspired by this, we propose the Probability Density-Aware Coreset (PDAC) method. PDAC leverages the Projected Gaussian Mixture (PGM) model to estimate each sample's joint density, enabling efficient density-prioritized buffer selection.

Synthetic data generation offers scalability, but its effectiveness relies on complex, multi-stage workflows, integrating prompt engineering and model orchestration. Existing automated workflow methods face a cold start problem: they require labeled datasets for reward modeling, which is especially problematic for subjective, open-ended tasks with no objective ground truth. We introduce AutoSynth, a framework that automates workflow discovery and optimization without reference datasets by reframing the problem as a Monte Carlo Tree Search guided by a novel dataset-free hybrid reward. This reward enables meta-learning through two LLM-as-judge components: one evaluates sample quality using dynamically generated task-specific metrics, and another assesses workflow code and prompt quality. Experiments on subjective educational tasks show that while expert-designed workflows achieve higher human preference rates (96-99% win rates vs. AutoSynth's 40-51%), models trained on AutoSynth-generated data dramatically outperform baselines (40-51% vs. 2-5%) and match or surpass expert workflows on certain metrics, suggesting discovery of quality dimensions beyond human intuition. These results are achieved while reducing human effort from 5-7 hours to just 30 minutes (>90% reduction). AutoSynth tackles the cold start issue in data-centric AI, offering a scalable, cost-effective method for subjective LLM tasks.

A least-squares temporal difference learning scheme is then developed to estimate the quadratic critic parameters efficiently. This construction enables a quasi-Newton actor update using information learned by the critic, yielding faster convergence compared to first-order methods.

The task is complicated by the large modality gap between sequences and phenotypes, as well as the pleiotropic nature of gene-phenotype relationships. Existing sequence-based efforts focus on the degree to which variants of specific genes alter a limited set of phenotypes, while general gene knockout induced phenotype abnormality prediction methods heavily rely on curated genetic information as inputs, which limits scalability and generalizability. As a result, the task of broadly predicting the presence of multiple phenotype abnormalities under gene knockout directly from gene sequences remains underexplored. We introduce GenePheno, the first interpretable multi-label prediction framework that predicts knockout induced phenotypic abnormalities from gene sequences. GenePheno employs a contrastive multi-label learning objective that captures inter-phenotype correlations, complemented by an exclusive regularization that enforces biological consistency.

Specifically, a Hamming distance-driven time-domain scheme is implemented for multi-class TMs. Furthermore, differential delay paths, combined with a leading-ones-detector logarithmic delay compression digital-time-domain scheme, are utilised for the coalesced TMs, accommodating both binary-signed and exponential-scale delay accumulation issues.

Existing approaches either ignore structural context or rely on expensive, memory-intensive encoding that limits throughput and scalability. We present SiDGen (Structure-informed Diffusion Generator), a protein-conditioned diffusion framework that integrates masked SMILES generation with lightweight folding-derived features for pocket awareness. To balance expressivity with efficiency, SiDGen supports two conditioning pathways: a streamlined mode that pools coarse structural signals from protein embeddings and a full mode that injects localized pairwise biases for stronger coupling. A coarse-stride folding mechanism with nearest-neighbor upsampling alleviates the quadratic memory costs of pair tensors, enabling training on realistic sequence lengths. Learning stability is maintained through in-loop chemical validity checks and an invalidity penalty, while large-scale training efficiency is restored \\textit{via} selective compilation, dataloader tuning, and gradient accumulation. In automated benchmarks, SiDGen generates ligands with high validity, uniqueness, and novelty, while achieving competitive performance in docking-based evaluations and maintaining reasonable molecular properties.
