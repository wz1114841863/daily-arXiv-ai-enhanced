Yet, they are almost\nalways executed monolithically, which underutilizes the heterogeneous\naccelerators (NPUs, GPUs, DSPs) in modern SoCs and leads to high end-to-end\nlatency. In this paper, we present NANOMIND, a hardware--software co-design\ninference framework for Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) that breaks large models\ninto modular ``bricks'' (vision, language, audio, etc.) and maps each to its\nideal accelerator. The key insight is that large models can be broken into\nmodular components and scheduled to run on the most appropriate compute units.\nIt performs module-level dynamic offloading across accelerators on\nunified-memory SoCs. By combining customized hardware design, system-level\nscheduling, and optimized low-bit computation kernels, we demonstrate our\nframework with a compact, battery-powered device capable of running LMMs\nentirely on device. This prototype functions as a self-contained intelligent\nassistant that requires no network connectivity, while achieving higher\nthroughput and superior power efficiency under strict resource constraints. The\ndesign further bypasses CPU bottlenecks and reduces redundant memory usage\nthrough token-aware buffer management and module-level coordination.

We used a dataset of 40 well-connected SPEs (1997-2017) observed by\nNOAA GOES, each associated with a >=M-class western-hemisphere solar flare and\nundisturbed proton flux profiles. Using 4-fold stratified cross-validation, we\nevaluate seq2seq model configurations (varying hidden units and embedding\ndimensions) under multiple forecasting scenarios: (i) proton-only input vs.\ncombined proton+X-ray input, (ii) original flux data vs. trend-smoothed data,\nand (iii) autoregressive vs. one-shot forecasting. Our major results are as\nfollows: First, one-shot forecasting consistently yields lower error than\nautoregressive prediction, avoiding the error accumulation seen in iterative\napproaches. Second, on the original data, proton-only models outperform\nproton+X-ray models. However, with trend-smoothed data, this gap narrows or\nreverses in proton+X-ray models. Third, trend-smoothing significantly enhances\nthe performance of proton+X-ray models by mitigating fluctuations in the X-ray\nchannel. Fourth, while models trained on trendsmoothed data perform best on\naverage, the best-performing model was trained on original data, suggesting\nthat architectural choices can sometimes outweigh the benefits of data\npreprocessing."}

In such settings, models often benefit from diverse\nchains-of-thought to arrive at multiple candidate solutions. This requires two\ncompeting objectives: to inject enough stochasticity to explore multiple\nreasoning chains, and to ensure sufficient accuracy and quality in each path.\nExisting works pursue the first objective by increasing exploration at highly\nuncertain steps with higher temperature or larger candidate token sets, while\nothers improve reliability by rejecting samples with low confidence\npost-generation, implying that low confidence correlates with low answer\nquality. These two lines of thought are in conflict, as they conflate different\nsources of uncertainty. To resolve this, we argue that the decoding rule should\nbe calibrated by correctness, not confidence alone. We should sample from\ntokens with higher estimated correctness, and reduce sampling where expected\ncorrectness is low. We propose simple strategies that achieve this goal:\nGreedy-Threshold makes sampling greedy at very low confidence steps.\nCalibrated-TopK and Calibrated-epsilon set truncation threshold based on\nestimated rank-wise correctness.

Building on the insights drawn from the theoretical analysis, we show\nthat oversmoothing increases as the number of trainable weight matrices and the\nnumber of adjacency matrices increases.

To\nanalyze the mechanism, we further study settings with fixed expert policies\nobtained independently of the gate and show that the learned language gate\ncomposes these experts to produce behaviors appropriate to novel task\ndescriptions and unseen task combinations. These results indicate that\nnatural-language metadata can effectively index and recombine reusable skills\nwithin a single policy."}

While HP\nguarantees are extensively studied in centralized settings, much less is\nunderstood in the decentralized, networked setup. Existing HP studies in\ndecentralized settings impose strong assumptions, like uniformly bounded\ngradients, or asymptotically vanishing noise, resulting in a significant gap\nbetween assumptions used to establish convergence in the HP and the\nmean-squared error (MSE) sense, even for vanilla Decentralized Stochastic\nGradient Descent ($\\mathtt{DSGD}$) algorithm. This is contrary to centralized\nsettings, where it is known that $\\mathtt{SGD}$ converges in HP under the same\nconditions on the cost function as needed to guarantee MSE convergence.\nMotivated by this observation, we revisit HP guarantees for $\\mathtt{DSGD}$ in\nthe presence of light-tailed noise. We show that $\\mathtt{DSGD}$ converges in\nHP under the same conditions on the cost as in the MSE sense, removing\nuniformly bounded gradients and other restrictive assumptions, while\nsimultaneously achieving order-optimal rates for both non-convex and strongly\nconvex costs. Moreover, our improved analysis yields linear speed-up in the\nnumber of users, demonstrating that $\\mathtt{DSGD}$ maintains strong\nperformance in the HP sense and matches existing MSE guarantees. Our improved\nresults stem from a careful analysis of the MGF of quantities of interest\n(norm-squared of gradient or optimality gap) and the MGF of the consensus gap\nbetween users' models. To achieve linear speed-up, we provide a novel result on\nthe variance-reduction effect of decentralized methods in the HP sense and more\nfine-grained bounds on the MGF for strongly convex costs, which are both of\nindependent interest."}

To evaluate this, we conduct three\nexperiments in a grid-world capture game inspired by Stag Hunt, a game theory\nparadigm that balances risk and reward. In Experiment 1, we compare decisions\nfrom 30 human participants and 2 expert judges with outputs from LLaMA 3.1 and\nMixtral 8x22B models.

Standard policy gradient\nmethods, which use a single global baseline, suffer from what we identify and\nformalize as cross-stratum bias-an \"apples-to-oranges\" comparison of\nheterogeneous trajectories. This cross-stratum bias distorts credit assignment\nand hinders exploration of complex, multi-step search strategies. To address\nthis, we propose Stratified GRPO, whose central component, Stratified Advantage\nNormalization (SAN), partitions trajectories into homogeneous strata based on\ntheir structural properties and computes advantages locally within each\nstratum. This ensures that trajectories are evaluated only against their true\npeers. Our analysis proves that SAN eliminates cross-stratum bias, yields\nconditionally unbiased unit-variance estimates inside each stratum, and retains\nthe global unbiasedness and unit-variance properties enjoyed by standard\nnormalization, resulting in a more pure and scale-stable learning signal. To\nimprove practical stability under finite-sample regimes, we further linearly\nblend SAN with the global estimator.
