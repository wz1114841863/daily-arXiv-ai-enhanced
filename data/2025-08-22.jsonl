However, the high-frequency traversal characteristic of quantum\nsimulators represents an unprecedented demand in the history of IT, and\nexisting distributed technologies is unable to meet this requirement, resulting\nin a single-node bottleneck of quantum simulator. To overcome this limitation,\nthis paper introduces a novel Distributed Shared Layered Storage Quantum\nSimulator (DSLSQS). By leveraging an innovative distributed architecture in\nwhich multiple computational nodes share data storage directly, together with\nDe-TCP/IP networking technology, DSLSQS effectively eliminates East-West data\nflow in distributed systems.

This setting arises naturally in distributed and\nfederated learning, crowdsourcing, and sensor networks, yet existing robust\nestimators typically assume uniform or worst-case corruption, ignoring\nstructural heterogeneity. For mean estimation for multivariate bounded\ndistributions and univariate gaussian distributions, we give tight minimax\nrates for all heterogeneous corruption patterns. For multivariate gaussian mean\nestimation and linear regression, we establish the minimax rate for squared\nerror up to a factor of $\\sqrt{d}$, where $d$ is the dimension. Roughly, our\nfindings suggest that samples beyond a certain corruption threshold may be\ndiscarded by the optimal estimators -- this threshold is determined by the\nempirical distribution of the corruption rates given."}

However, their effectiveness is often highly sensitive to the choice of\nhyperparameters, especially the step-size. Tuning these parameters is often\ndifficult, resource-intensive, and time-consuming. Therefore, recent efforts\nhave been directed toward enhancing the stability of optimizers across a wide\nrange of hyperparameter choices [Schaipp et al., 2024]. In this paper, we\nintroduce an algorithm that matches the performance of state-of-the-art\noptimizers while improving stability to the choice of the step-size\nhyperparameter through a novel adaptation of the NGN step-size method [Orvieto\nand Xiao, 2024].

RoPE, a recent SBI\napproach, addresses this challenge through a two-stage domain transfer process\nthat combines semi-supervised calibration with optimal transport (OT)-based\ndistribution alignment. However, RoPE operates in a fully transductive setting,\nrequiring access to a batch of test samples at inference time, which limits\nscalability and generalization. We propose here a fully inductive and amortized\nSBI framework that integrates calibration and distributional alignment into a\nsingle, end-to-end trainable model. Our method leverages mini-batch OT with a\nclosed-form coupling to align real and simulated observations that correspond\nto the same latent parameters, using both paired calibration data and unpaired\nsamples. A conditional normalizing flow is then trained to approximate the\nOT-induced posterior, enabling efficient inference without simulation access at\ntest time. Across a range of synthetic and real-world benchmarks--including\ncomplex medical biomarker estimation--our approach matches or surpasses the\nperformance of RoPE, as well as other standard SBI and non-SBI estimators,\nwhile offering improved scalability and applicability in challenging,\nmisspecified environments."}

In these\napplications, anomaly detection plays an important role. Recently, studies have\nshown that anomalies on graphs induce spectral shifts. Some supervised methods\nhave improved the utilization of such spectral domain information. However,\nthey remain limited by the scarcity of labeled data due to the nature of\nanomalies. On the other hand, existing unsupervised learning approaches\npredominantly rely on spatial information or only employ low-pass filters,\nthereby losing the capacity for multi-band analysis. In this paper, we propose\nGraph Autoencoder with Spectral Encoder and Spectral Decoder (GRASPED) for node\nanomaly detection. Our unsupervised learning model features an encoder based on\nGraph Wavelet Convolution, along with structural and attribute decoders. The\nGraph Wavelet Convolution-based encoder, combined with a Wiener Graph\nDeconvolution-based decoder, exhibits bandpass filter characteristics that\ncapture global and local graph information at multiple scales.

Individual fairness demands that individuals differing only\nin sensitive attributes receive the same outcomes.

To improve\nindividual fairness, various training methods have been developed, such as\nincorporating fairness constraints as optimisation objectives. While these\nmethods have demonstrated empirical effectiveness, they lack formal guarantees\nof fairness. Existing approaches that aim to provide fairness guarantees\nprimarily rely on verification techniques, which can sometimes fail to produce\ndefinitive results. Moreover, verification alone does not actively enhance\nindividual fairness during training. To address this limitation, we propose a\nnovel framework that formally guarantees individual fairness throughout\ntraining. Our approach consists of two parts, i.e., (1) provably fair\ninitialisation that ensures the model starts in a fair state, and (2) a\nfairness-preserving training algorithm that maintains fairness as the model\nlearns. A key element of our method is the use of randomised response\nmechanisms, which protect sensitive attributes while maintaining fairness\nguarantees.
