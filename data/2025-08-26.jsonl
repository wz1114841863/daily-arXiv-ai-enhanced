To make sure that the data replicas are\nup-to-date, they need to synchronize, which typically means engaging the\nreplicas in waiting for coherent responses from each other. The amount of\nwaiting depends on the consistency and availability guarantees we impose on the\nsystem. The folklore CAP theory states that strong consistency (the set of\nreplicas create an illusion of one correct server) and strong availability (the\nreplicas' states are reachable despite network partitions) cannot be\nimplemented in the same system. A popular way to deal with this impossibility\nis to relax consistency to be only eventual: the replicas eventually converge\nto the same state. In return, the replicas can be wait-free, i.e., the clients\ncan get the data from the closest replica without waiting for other ones.\n  Wait-free data replication faces two important challenges. First, the\noperations issued by the clients may be constantly revoked, i.e., their effects\ncan be repeatedly recomputed due to asynchrony and concurrency. Second, even if\nsome operations eventually stabilize in their effects, a particular client may\nstill experience starvation if, from some point onward, each of its operations\nis later revoked. In this paper, we address these challenges through a general\nDAG-based framework for replicated data types, where replicas exchange their\nlocal views and merge them using a reconciliation function. Within this\nframework, we design reconciliation functions that implement a wait-free\neventually consistent replicated state machine ensuring both stable convergence\nand fair progress. Specifically, every replica maintains a growing sequence of\nclient operations, and we guarantee that: (1) all replicas share a common,\nmonotonically growing stable prefix of operations, and (2) no client starves."}

However, conventional DNN training\ntypically requires large-scale datasets, which imposes prohibitive overhead on\nedge devices-particularly for emerging large language model (LLM) tasks. To\naddress this challenge, a DNN-free method (ie., dataset sampling without DNN),\nnamed NMS (Near-Memory Sampling), has been introduced. By first conducting\ndimensionality reduction of the dataset and then performing exemplar sampling\nin the reduced space, NMS avoids the architectural bias inherent in DNN-based\nmethods and thus achieves better generalization. However, The state-of-the-art,\nNMS, suffers from two limitations: (1) The mismatch between the search method\nand the non-monotonic property of the perplexity error function leads to the\nemergence of outliers in the reduced representation; (2) Key parameter (ie.,\ntarget perplexity) is selected empirically, introducing arbitrariness and\nleading to uneven sampling. These two issues lead to representative bias of\nexamplars, resulting in degraded accuracy.

While\ntraditional risk assessment frameworks evaluate conventional cybersecurity\nrisks, they lack ability to address unique challenges posed by AML threats.\nExisting AML threat evaluation approaches focus primarily on technical attack\nrobustness, overlooking crucial real-world factors like deployment\nenvironments, system dependencies, and attack feasibility. Attempts at\ncomprehensive AML risk assessment have been limited to domain-specific\nsolutions, preventing application across diverse systems. Addressing these\nlimitations, we present FRAME, the first comprehensive and automated framework\nfor assessing AML risks across diverse ML-based systems. FRAME includes a novel\nrisk assessment method that quantifies AML risks by systematically evaluating\nthree key dimensions: target system's deployment environment, characteristics\nof diverse AML techniques, and empirical insights from prior research. FRAME\nincorporates a feasibility scoring mechanism and LLM-based customization for\nsystem-specific assessments. Additionally, we developed a comprehensive\nstructured dataset of AML attacks enabling context-aware risk assessment. From\nan engineering application perspective, FRAME delivers actionable results\ndesigned for direct use by system owners with only technical knowledge of their\nsystems, without expertise in AML.

Given an incomplete\nprocess instance, predictions about the outcome, next activity, or remaining\ntime are created. This is done by powerful machine learning models, which have\nshown impressive predictive performance. However, the data-driven nature of\nthese models makes them susceptible to finding unfair, biased, or unethical\npatterns in the data. Such patterns lead to biased predictions based on\nso-called sensitive attributes, such as the gender or age of process\nparticipants. Previous work has identified this problem and offered solutions\nthat mitigate biases by removing sensitive attributes entirely from the process\ninstance. However, sensitive attributes can be used both fairly and unfairly in\nthe same process instance. For example, during a medical process, treatment\ndecisions could be based on gender, while the decision to accept a patient\nshould not be based on gender. This paper proposes a novel, model-agnostic\napproach for identifying and rectifying biased decisions in predictive business\nprocess monitoring models, even when the same sensitive attribute is used both\nfairly and unfairly. The proposed approach uses a human-in-the-loop approach to\ndifferentiate between fair and unfair decisions through simple alterations on a\ndecision tree model distilled from the original prediction model.
