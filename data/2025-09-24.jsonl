Our analysis shows that, under\nrealistic architectural assumptions, particularly blocks comprising repeated\nlayers of similar capacity, enforcing smooth information flow (D1) naturally\nencourages entropy decay (D2), thus ensuring stable compression. Guided by\nthese insights, we propose Eloss, a novel entropy-based regularizer designed as\na lightweight, plug-and-play training objective. Rather than marginal accuracy\nimprovements, this approach represents a conceptual shift: it unifies\ninformation-theoretic stability with standard perception tasks, enabling\nexplicit, principled detection of anomalous sensor inputs through entropy\ndeviations. Experimental validation on large-scale 3D object detection\nbenchmarks (KITTI and nuScenes) demonstrates that incorporating Eloss\nconsistently achieves competitive or improved accuracy while dramatically\nenhancing sensitivity to anomalies, amplifying distribution-shift signals by up\nto two orders of magnitude. This stable information-compression perspective not\nonly improves interpretability but also establishes a solid theoretical\nfoundation for safer, more robust autonomous driving perception systems."}

To achieve this,\nthe study evaluates two key prefetching approaches: HMC (Hybrid Memory\nController) and HMC+L1, both of which employ prefetching mechanisms commonly\nused by processor vendors. The HMC approach integrates a prefetcher within the\noff-chip hybrid memory controller, while the HMC+L1 approach combines this with\nadditional L1 on-chip prefetchers.\n  Experimental results on an out-of-order execution processor show that on-chip\ncache prefetchers are crucial for maximizing the benefits of off-chip\nprefetching, which in turn further enhances performance. Specifically, the\noff-chip HMC prefetcher achieves coverage and accuracy rates exceeding 60% and\nup to 80%, while the combined HMC+L1 approach boosts off-chip prefetcher\ncoverage to as much as 92%. Consequently, overall performance increases from 9%\nwith the HMC approach to 12% when L1 prefetching is also employed."}

We fine-tune PPG-GPT a transformer-based foundation model\npretrained on intensive care unit (ICU) data across three heterogeneous\ndatasets (ICU, wearable, smartphone) and systematically evaluate the effects on\nHR prediction accuracy and gender fairness. While fine-tuning substantially\nreduces mean absolute error (up to 80%), it can simultaneously widen fairness\ngaps, especially in larger models and under significant distributional\ncharacteristics shifts. To address this, we introduce FairTune, a bias-aware\nfine-tuning framework in which we benchmark three mitigation strategies: class\nweighting based on inverse group frequency (IF), Group Distributionally Robust\nOptimization (GroupDRO), and adversarial debiasing (ADV). We find that IF and\nGroupDRO significantly reduce fairness gaps without compromising accuracy, with\neffectiveness varying by deployment domain.

Although agents seek distinct\nobjectives, collaboration among them can be beneficial in scenarios where\nrelationships between tasks exist. Among the various approaches to promoting\nrelationships between tasks and, consequently, enhancing collaboration between\nagents, one notable method is regularization. While previous multitask learning\nstudies have focused on smooth regularization to enforce graph smoothness, this\nwork explores non-smooth regularization techniques that promote sparsity,\nmaking them particularly effective in encouraging piecewise constant\ntransitions on the graph. We begin by formulating a global regularized\noptimization problem, which involves minimizing the aggregate sum of individual\ncosts, regularized by a general non-smooth term designed to promote\npiecewise-constant relationships between the tasks of neighboring agents. Based\non the forward-backward splitting strategy, we propose a decentralized learning\napproach that enables efficient solutions to the regularized optimization\nproblem. Then, under convexity assumptions on the cost functions and\nco-regularization, we establish that the proposed approach converges in the\nmean-square-error sense within $O(\\mu)$ of the optimal solution of the globally\nregularized cost.

We disentangle\nthese questions using grokking, a training regime in which memorization\nprecedes generalization, allowing us to temporally separate generalization from\ntraining dynamics and we find that while both neural collapse and relative\nflatness emerge near the onset of generalization, only flatness consistently\npredicts it.

However, KV cache fetches can become\na bottleneck when network bandwidth is limited. Compression mitigates the\nbandwidth issue, but can degrade overall performance when decompression\ninterferes with model computation.\n  We present ShadowServe, the first SmartNIC-accelerated, interference-free\nprefix caching system for LLM serving. ShadowServe separates a control plane on\nthe host and a data plane fully offloaded to the SmartNIC, which eliminates\ninterference to both host GPU and CPU. To overcome the SmartNIC's limited\ncompute and memory resources, we design a chunked pipeline that parallelizes\ndata plane operations across the SmartNIC's compute resources, and a\nminimal-copy memory management scheme that reduces memory pressure on the\nSmartNIC. Compared to state-of-the-art solutions, ShadowServe achieves up to\n2.2x lower loaded time-per-output-token (TPOT), and reduces time-to-first-token\n(TTFT) by up to 1.38x in low-bandwidth scenarios (<= 20 Gbps), translating to\nup to 1.35x higher throughput."}

Existing machine learning-based initializers achieve\nstate-of-the-art results yet remain constrained to single-task domains and\nsmall datasets of only hundreds of samples. We address these limitations by\nreformulating VQA parameter initialization as a generative modeling problem and\nintroducing DiffQ, a parameter initializer based on the Denoising Diffusion\nProbabilistic Model (DDPM). To support robust training and evaluation, we\nconstruct a dataset of 15,085 instances spanning three domains and five\nrepresentative tasks. Experiments demonstrate that DiffQ surpasses baselines,\nreducing initial loss by up to 8.95 and convergence steps by up to 23.4%."}

While software-level optimizations\nsuch as quantization and pruning reduce model size and computation, hardware\nacceleration has emerged as a decisive enabler for efficient embedded\ninference. This paper evaluates the impact of Neural Processing Units (NPUs) on\nMCU-based ML execution, using the ARM Cortex-M55 core combined with the\nEthos-U55 NPU on the Alif Semiconductor Ensemble E7 development board as a\nrepresentative platform. A rigorous measurement methodology was employed,\nincorporating per-inference net energy accounting via GPIO-triggered\nhigh-resolution digital multimeter synchronization and idle-state subtraction,\nensuring accurate attribution of energy costs. Experimental results across six\nrepresentative ML models -including MiniResNet, MobileNetV2, FD-MobileNet,\nMNIST, TinyYolo, and SSD-MobileNet- demonstrate substantial efficiency gains\nwhen inference is offloaded to the NPU. For moderate to large networks, latency\nimprovements ranged from 7x to over 125x, with per-inference net energy\nreductions up to 143x. Notably, the NPU enabled execution of models unsupported\non CPU-only paths, such as SSD-MobileNet, highlighting its functional as well\nas efficiency advantages. These findings establish NPUs as a cornerstone of\nenergy-aware embedded AI, enabling real-time, power-constrained ML inference at\nthe MCU level."}
