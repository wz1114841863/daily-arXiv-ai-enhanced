The Reuse Distance Histogram (RDH) is\na widely used metric to quantify temporal locality, measuring the distance\nbetween consecutive accesses to the same memory location. Traditionally,\ncalculating RDH requires program execution and memory trace collection to\nobtain dynamic memory access behavior. This trace collection is often\ntime-consuming, resource-intensive, and unsuitable for early-stage optimization\nor large-scale applications. Static prediction, on the other hand, offers a\nsignificant speedup in estimating RDH and cache hit rates. However, these\napproaches lack accuracy, since the predictions come without running the\nprogram and knowing the complete memory access pattern, more specifically when\narrays are used inside nested loops. This paper presents a novel static\nanalysis framework for predicting the reuse profiles of array references in\nprograms with nested loop structures, without requiring any runtime\ninformation. By analyzing loop bounds, access patterns in smaller problem\nsizes, and predictive equations, our method predicts access patterns of arrays\nand estimates reuse distances and cache hit rate at compile time.

To prevent transferring task-irrelevant noise through the\nshared pathway, we integrate a task-aware discriminator within a GAN.

We introduce Conversational\nOrientation Reasoning (COR), a new benchmark designed for Traditional Chinese\nconversational navigation projected from real-world environments, addressing\negocentric-to-allocentric reasoning in non-English and ASR-transcribed\nscenarios. We propose a multimodal chain-of-thought (MCoT) framework, which\nintegrates ASR-transcribed speech with landmark coordinates through a\nstructured three-step reasoning process: (1) extracting spatial relations, (2)\nmapping coordinates to absolute directions, and (3) inferring user orientation.\nA curriculum learning strategy progressively builds these capabilities on\nTaiwan-LLM-13B-v2.0-Chat, a mid-sized model representative of\nresource-constrained settings. Experiments show that MCoT achieves 100%\norientation accuracy on clean transcripts and 98.1% with ASR transcripts,\nsubstantially outperforming unimodal and non-structured baselines. Moreover,\nMCoT demonstrates robustness under noisy conversational conditions, including\nASR recognition errors and multilingual code-switching. The model also\nmaintains high accuracy in cross-domain evaluation and resilience to linguistic\nvariation, domain shift, and referential ambiguity. These findings highlight\nthe potential of structured MCoT spatial reasoning as a path toward\ninterpretable and resource-efficient embodied navigation."}

Successive generations, including GPT-o\nseries, DeepSeek-R1, Kimi-K1.5, Grok 4, and GLM-4.5, have relied on large-scale\nRL training to enhance reasoning and coding capabilities. To meet the\ncommunity's growing RL needs, numerous RL frameworks have been proposed. Most\nof these frameworks primarily rely on inference engines for rollout generation\nand training engines for policy updates. However, RL training remains\ncomputationally expensive, with rollout generation accounting for more than 90%\nof total runtime. In addition, its efficiency is often constrained by the\nlong-tail distribution of rollout response lengths, where a few lengthy\nresponses stall entire batches, leaving GPUs idle and underutilized. As model\nand rollout sizes continue to grow, this bottleneck increasingly limits\nscalability. To address this challenge, we propose Active Partial Rollouts in\nReinforcement Learning (APRIL), which mitigates long-tail inefficiency. In the\nrollout phase, APRIL over-provisions rollout requests, terminates once the\ntarget number of responses is reached, and recycles incomplete responses for\ncontinuation in future steps. This strategy ensures that no rollouts are\ndiscarded while substantially reducing GPU idle time. Experiments show that\nAPRIL improves rollout throughput by at most 44% across commonly used RL\nalgorithms (GRPO, DAPO, GSPO), accelerates convergence, and achieves at most 8%\nhigher final accuracy across tasks. Moreover, APRIL is both framework and\nhardware agnostic, already integrated into the slime RL framework, and\ndeployable on NVIDIA and AMD GPUs alike. Taken together, this work unifies\nsystem-level and algorithmic considerations in proposing APRIL, with the aim of\nadvancing RL training efficiency and inspiring further optimizations in RL\nsystems."}

We seek to address these limitations. We propose AxelGNN, a novel\nGNN architecture inspired by Axelrod's cultural dissemination model that\naddresses these limitations through a unified framework. AxelGNN incorporates\nsimilarity-gated probabilistic interactions that adaptively promote convergence\nor divergence based on node similarity, implements trait-level copying\nmechanisms for fine-grained feature aggregation at the segment level, and\nmaintains global polarization to preserve node distinctiveness across multiple\nrepresentation clusters. The model's bistable convergence dynamics naturally\nhandle both homophilic and heterophilic graphs within a single architecture.\nExtensive experiments on node classification and influence estimation\nbenchmarks demonstrate that AxelGNN consistently outperforms or matches\nstate-of-the-art GNN methods across diverse graph structures with varying\nhomophily-heterophily characteristics."}

Finally, we delve into the\nimpact of weight quantization on ACN performance using novel metrics related to\npractical IC considerations, such as IC floor space and comparator\ndecision-making efficacy."}

However, as LLMs handle\nconfidential inputs and are fine-tuned on costly, proprietary datasets, their\nheightened security requirements slow adoption in privacy-sensitive sectors\nsuch as healthcare and finance. We investigate methods to address this gap and\npropose Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) as a solution for securing\nend-to-end LLM inference. We validate their practicality by evaluating these\ncompute-intensive workloads entirely within CPU and GPU TEEs. On the CPU side,\nwe conduct an in-depth study running full Llama2 inference pipelines (7B, 13B,\n70B) inside Intel's TDX and SGX, accelerated by Advanced Matrix Extensions\n(AMX). We derive 12 insights, including that across various data types, batch\nsizes, and input lengths, CPU TEEs impose under 10% throughput and 20% latency\noverheads, further reduced by AMX. We run LLM inference on NVIDIA H100\nConfidential Compute GPUs, contextualizing our CPU findings and observing\nthroughput penalties of 4-8% that diminish as batch and input sizes grow. By\ncomparing performance, cost, and security trade-offs, we show how CPU TEEs can\nbe more cost-effective or secure than their GPU counterparts. To our knowledge,\nour work is the first to comprehensively demonstrate the performance and\npracticality of modern TEEs across both CPUs and GPUs for enabling confidential\nLLMs (cLLMs)."}

We utilize\nStacked Intelligent Metasurfaces (SIMs) to control wireless propagation,\nenabling the channel itself to perform over-the-air computation. This\neliminates the need for symbol estimation at the receiver, significantly\nreducing computational and communication overhead. Our approach models the\ntransmitter-channel-receiver system as an end-to-end Deep Neural Network (DNN)\nwhere the response of the SIM elements are trainable parameters. To address\nchannel variability, we incorporate a dedicated DNN module responsible for\ndynamically adjusting transmission power leveraging user location information.\nOur performance evaluations showcase that the proposed metasurfaces-integrated\nDNN framework with deep SIM architectures are capable of balancing\nclassification accuracy and power consumption under diverse scenarios, offering\nsignificant energy efficiency improvements."}
