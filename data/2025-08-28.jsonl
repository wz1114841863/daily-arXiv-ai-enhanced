A common strategy in high-density flash storage is to\nprogram selected blocks in a low-density mode (SLC), sacrificing some capacity\nto achieve higher I/O performance. This hybrid storage architecture has been\nwidely adopted in consumer-grade storage systems. However, existing hybrid\nstorage schemes typically focus on write performance and rely solely on data\ntemperature for migration decisions. This often results in excessive mode\nswitching, causing substantial capacity overhead.\n  In this paper, we present RARO (Reliability-Aware Read performance\nOptimization), a hybrid flash management scheme designed to improve read\nperformance with minimal capacity cost. The key insight behind RARO is that\nmuch of the read slowdown in QLC flash is caused by read retries. RARO triggers\ndata migration only when hot data resides in QLC blocks experiencing a high\nnumber of read retries, significantly reducing unnecessary conversions and\ncapacity loss. Moreover, RARO supports fine-grained multi-mode conversions\n(SLC-TLC-QLC) to further minimize capacity overhead.

To address these concerns, the Input-Output\nMemory Management Unit (IOMMU) plays a key role in mediating and regulating\nmemory access, preventing unauthorized transactions while enforcing isolation\nand access control policies. While prior work has explored IOMMU-related\nside-channel vulnerabilities from a security standpoint, its role in\nperformance interference remains largely unexplored. Moreover, many of the same\narchitectural properties that enable side-channel leakage, such as shared TLBs,\ncaching effects, and translation overheads, can also introduce timing\nunpredictability. In this work, we analyze the contention effects within IOMMU\nstructures using the Xilinx UltraScale+ ZCU104 platform, demonstrating how\ntheir shared nature introduce unpredictable delays. Our findings reveal that\nIOMMU-induced interference primarily affects small memory transactions, where\ntranslation overheads significantly impact execution time. Additionally, we\nhypothesize that contention effects arising from IOTLBs exhibit similar\nbehavior across architectures due to shared caching principles, such as\nprefetching and hierarchical TLB structures. Notably, our experiments show that\nIOMMU interference can delay DMA transactions by up to 1.79x for lower-size\ntransfers on the Arm SMMUv2 implementation."}

We first establish an inverse relationship between memorization\nand graph homophily, i.e., the property that connected nodes share similar\nlabels/features. We find that lower homophily significantly increases\nmemorization, indicating that GNNs rely on memorization to learn less\nhomophilic graphs. Secondly, we analyze GNN training dynamics. We find that the\nincreased memorization in low homophily graphs is tightly coupled to the GNNs'\nimplicit bias on using graph structure during learning. In low homophily\nregimes, this structure is less informative, hence inducing memorization of the\nnode labels to minimize training loss. Finally, we show that nodes with higher\nlabel inconsistency in their feature-space neighborhood are significantly more\nprone to memorization.

In generative models, surjectivity implies that any output,\nincluding harmful or undesirable content, can in principle be generated by the\nnetworks, raising concerns about model safety and jailbreak vulnerabilities. In\nthis paper, we prove that many fundamental building blocks of modern neural\narchitectures, such as networks with pre-layer normalization and\nlinear-attention modules, are almost always surjective. As corollaries, widely\nused generative frameworks, including GPT-style transformers and diffusion\nmodels with deterministic ODE solvers, admit inverse mappings for arbitrary\noutputs. By studying surjectivity of these modern and commonly used neural\narchitectures, we contribute a formalism that sheds light on their unavoidable\nvulnerability to a broad class of adversarial attacks."}

To address such stability-plasticity\ndilemma, this study proposes a novel CL method, synergetic memory rehearsal\n(SyReM), for DNN-based motion forecasting. SyReM maintains a compact memory\nbuffer to represent learned knowledge.

Synergistically, a selective memory rehearsal mechanism is\ndesigned to enhance learning plasticity by selecting samples from the memory\nbuffer that are most similar to recently observed data. This selection is based\non an online-measured cosine similarity of loss gradients, ensuring targeted\nmemory rehearsal. Since replayed samples originate from learned scenarios, this\nmemory rehearsal mechanism avoids compromising memory stability.

To address these challenges, we propose\nFlowletFormer, a BERT-based pre-training model specifically designed for\nnetwork traffic analysis. FlowletFormer introduces a Coherent Behavior-Aware\nTraffic Representation Model for segmenting traffic into semantically\nmeaningful units, a Protocol Stack Alignment-Based Embedding Layer to capture\nmultilayer protocol semantics, and Field-Specific and Context-Aware Pretraining\nTasks to enhance both inter-packet and inter-flow learning. Experimental\nresults demonstrate that FlowletFormer significantly outperforms existing\nmethods in the effectiveness of traffic representation, classification\naccuracy, and few-shot learning capability. Moreover, by effectively\nintegrating domain-specific network knowledge, FlowletFormer shows better\ncomprehension of the principles of network transmission (e.g., stateful\nconnections of TCP), providing a more robust and trustworthy framework for\ntraffic analysis."}
