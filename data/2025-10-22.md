### [1] [Metrics and evaluations for computational and sustainable AI efficiency](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17885)
*Hongyuan Liu,Xinyang Liu,Guosheng Hu*

Main category: cs.PF

TL;DR: 提出一个统一的AI模型推理评估方法，整合计算和环境指标，在保持精度约束下系统测量延迟、吞吐量、能耗和碳排，为可持续AI部署提供决策依据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI快速发展对算力需求激增，但现有评估方法碎片化，难以在不同硬件、软件栈和数值精度下进行系统比较和优化，缺乏对环境影响的全方位考量。

Method: 开发统一可复现的评估框架，在真实服务条件下系统测量延迟和吞吐量分布、能耗、位置调整的碳排放，同时保持精度约束以确保有效比较。

Result: 应用该方法到多精度模型和多样化硬件平台（从数据中心加速器到消费级GPU），建立了严格的基准测试框架，生成决策就绪的帕累托前沿。

Conclusion: 该工作建立了严谨的基准测试框架，明确了精度、延迟、能耗和碳排放之间的权衡关系，开源代码支持独立验证，助力研究人员和实践者做出基于证据的可持续AI部署决策。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AI) has created
unprecedented demands for computational power, yet methods for evaluating the
performance, efficiency, and environmental impact of deployed models remain
fragmented. Current approaches often fail to provide a holistic view, making it
difficult to compare and optimise systems across heterogeneous hardware,
software stacks, and numeric precisions. To address this gap, we propose a
unified and reproducible methodology for AI model inference that integrates
computational and environmental metrics under realistic serving conditions. Our
framework provides a pragmatic, carbon-aware evaluation by systematically
measuring latency and throughput distributions, energy consumption, and
location-adjusted carbon emissions, all while maintaining matched accuracy
constraints for valid comparisons. We apply this methodology to multi-precision
models across diverse hardware platforms, from data-centre accelerators like
the GH200 to consumer-level GPUs such as the RTX 4090, running on mainstream
software stacks including PyTorch, TensorRT, and ONNX Runtime. By
systematically categorising these factors, our work establishes a rigorous
benchmarking framework that produces decision-ready Pareto frontiers,
clarifying the trade-offs between accuracy, latency, energy, and carbon. The
accompanying open-source code enables independent verification and facilitates
adoption, empowering researchers and practitioners to make evidence-based
decisions for sustainable AI deployment.

### [2] [From Noise to Laws: Regularized Time-Series Forecasting via Denoised Dynamic Graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17817)
*Hongwei Ma,Junbin Gao,Minh-ngoc Tran*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PRISM模型结合了基于分数的扩散预处理、动态图编码器和物理正则化，用于长时多元时间序列预测，在六个基准测试中实现了最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决长时多元时间序列预测的三个关键挑战：对异质信号去噪、跟踪时变跨序列依赖关系、在长预测周期内保持稳定性和物理合理性。

Method: 耦合基于分数的扩散预处理器、动态相关性阈值图编码器，以及通过通用物理惩罚正则化的预测头。

Result: 在六个标准基准测试中，PRISM实现了持续的最先进性能，在MSE和MAE指标上获得显著提升。

Conclusion: PRISM通过理论证明和实验验证，展示了在长时多元时间序列预测中的有效性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Long-horizon multivariate time-series forecasting is challenging because
realistic predictions must (i) denoise heterogeneous signals, (ii) track
time-varying cross-series dependencies, and (iii) remain stable and physically
plausible over long rollout horizons. We present PRISM, which couples a
score-based diffusion preconditioner with a dynamic, correlation-thresholded
graph encoder and a forecast head regularized by generic physics penalties. We
prove contraction of the induced horizon dynamics under mild conditions and
derive Lipschitz bounds for graph blocks, explaining the model's robustness. On
six standard benchmarks , PRISM achieves consistent SOTA with strong MSE and
MAE gains.

### [3] [GRETEL: A Goal-driven Retrieval and Execution-based Trial Framework for LLM Tool Selection Enhancing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17843)
*Zongze Wu,Yani Guo,Churong Liang,Runnan Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GRETEL通过执行验证解决工具检索中的语义-功能差距问题，显著提升工具检索性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于语义相似度的工具检索方法存在语义-功能差距，经常检索到文本相关但功能不可用的工具

Method: GRETEL采用代理工作流，通过沙盒化的计划-执行-评估循环对语义检索的候选工具进行实证验证

Result: 在ToolBench基准测试中，Pass Rate从0.690提升到0.826，Recall从0.841提升到0.867，NDCG从0.807提升到0.857

Conclusion: 基于执行的验证为工具选择提供了比单纯语义相似度更可靠的基础，能够实现更鲁棒的代理性能

Abstract: Despite remarkable advances in Large Language Model capabilities, tool
retrieval for agent-based systems remains fundamentally limited by reliance on
semantic similarity, which fails to capture functional viability. Current
methods often retrieve textually relevant but functionally inoperative tools
due to parameter mismatches, authentication failures, and execution
constraints--a phenomenon we term the semantic-functional gap. We introduce
GRETEL, to address this gap through systematic empirical validation. GRETEL
implements an agentic workflow that processes semantically retrieved candidates
through sandboxed plan-execute-evaluate cycles, generating execution-grounded
evidence to distinguish truly functional tools from merely descriptive matches.
Our comprehensive evaluation on the ToolBench benchmark demonstrates
substantial improvements across all metrics: Pass Rate (at 10) increases from
0.690 to 0.826, Recall (at 10) improves from 0.841 to 0.867, and NDCG (at 10)
rises from 0.807 to 0.857.. These results establish that execution-based
validation provides a more reliable foundation for tool selection than semantic
similarity alone, enabling more robust agent performance in real-world
applications.

### [4] [CARLE: A Hybrid Deep-Shallow Learning Framework for Robust and Explainable RUL Estimation of Rolling Element Bearings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17846)
*Waleed Razzaq,Yun-Bo Zhao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出CARLE混合AI框架，结合深度学习和浅层学习，用于滚动轴承剩余使用寿命预测，在动态工况下优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有剩余使用寿命预测方法在变化工况下缺乏泛化性和鲁棒性，需要更可靠的预测框架。

Method: 使用Res-CNN和Res-LSTM块结合多头注意力和残差连接捕获时空退化模式，随机森林回归器进行稳定预测，高斯滤波降噪和连续小波变换提取时频特征。

Result: 在XJTU-SY和PRONOSTIA轴承数据集上评估，消融实验验证各组件贡献，噪声和跨域实验测试鲁棒性和泛化性，优于多种先进方法。

Conclusion: CARLE框架在动态条件下表现出色，通过LIME和SHAP分析提高模型可解释性和可信度。

Abstract: Prognostic Health Management (PHM) systems monitor and predict equipment
health. A key task is Remaining Useful Life (RUL) estimation, which predicts
how long a component, such as a rolling element bearing, will operate before
failure. Many RUL methods exist but often lack generalizability and robustness
under changing operating conditions. This paper introduces CARLE, a hybrid AI
framework that combines deep and shallow learning to address these challenges.
CARLE uses Res-CNN and Res-LSTM blocks with multi-head attention and residual
connections to capture spatial and temporal degradation patterns, and a Random
Forest Regressor (RFR) for stable, accurate RUL prediction. A compact
preprocessing pipeline applies Gaussian filtering for noise reduction and
Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT) for time-frequency feature extraction. We
evaluate CARLE on the XJTU-SY and PRONOSTIA bearing datasets. Ablation studies
measure each component's contribution, while noise and cross-domain experiments
test robustness and generalization. Comparative results show CARLE outperforms
several state-of-the-art methods, especially under dynamic conditions. Finally,
we analyze model interpretability with LIME and SHAP to assess transparency and
trustworthiness.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 需要开发能够捕捉参数依赖关系、嵌入物理知识并处理高梯度区域的快速准确代理模型

Method: 集成三个关键组件：融合DeepONet算子学习架构、物理引导的特征空间（嵌入激波对齐坐标系）、两阶段课程策略（强调高梯度区域）

Result: 在经典粘性Burgers方程上验证了框架的通用性和归纳偏置，该方程表现出对流陡化和激波样梯度

Conclusion: 该框架能够有效处理含激波流动问题，具有物理感知能力和良好的泛化性能

Abstract: We present a comprehensive, physics aware deep learning framework for
constructing fast and accurate surrogate models of rarefied, shock containing
micro nozzle flows. The framework integrates three key components, a Fusion
DeepONet operator learning architecture for capturing parameter dependencies, a
physics-guided feature space that embeds a shock-aligned coordinate system, and
a two-phase curriculum strategy emphasizing high-gradient regions. To
demonstrate the generality and inductive bias of the proposed framework, we
first validate it on the canonical viscous Burgers equation, which exhibits
advective steepening and shock like gradients.

### [6] [MIN-Merging: Merge the Important Neurons for Model Merging](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17890)
*Yunfei Liang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MIN-Merging是一个基于路由器的模型融合框架，通过选择性融合最重要神经元来减少参数冲突，在CV和NLP任务上均取得性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有模型融合方法存在参数冲突问题，会降低领域特定任务的性能，需要一种能结合多个开源模型优势同时避免冲突的解决方案。

Method: 提出基于路由器的MIN-Merging框架，选择性融合最重要的神经元，减少参数冲突。

Result: 在计算机视觉和自然语言处理基准测试中，MIN-Merging在领域内任务上获得一致性能提升，同时保持预训练模型在领域外任务上的泛化能力。

Conclusion: MIN-Merging是解决模型融合中参数冲突问题的有效实用方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in deep learning have led to a surge of open-source models
across diverse domains. While model merging offers a promising way to combine
their strengths, existing approaches often suffer from parameter conflicts that
degrade performance on domain-specific tasks. We propose MIN-Merging, a
router-based framework that selectively merges the most important neurons to
reduce such conflicts. Extensive experiments on Computer Vision(CV) and Natural
Language Processing(NLP) benchmarks show that MIN-Merging achieves consistent
gains on in-domain tasks while retaining the generalization ability of
pretrained models on out-of-domain tasks. These results highlight its
effectiveness as a practical solution to the parameter conflict problem in
model merging.

### [7] [Hierarchical Federated Unlearning for Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17895)
*Yisheng Zhong,Zhengbang Yang,Zhuangdi Zhu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种针对大语言模型的联邦遗忘方法，通过任务特定的适配器学习和分层合并策略来解决连续异构遗忘需求，在保护隐私的同时有效处理遗忘请求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在现实应用中的隐私安全问题和需要移除不良知识的需求日益突出，机器遗忘成为解决方案，但面临连续异构遗忘需求和分散敏感数据的挑战。

Method: 使用任务特定的适配器学习将遗忘和保留解耦，采用分层合并策略来缓解冲突目标，实现稳健可适应的遗忘更新。

Result: 在WMDP、MUSE和TOFU基准测试上的综合实验表明，该方法能有效处理异构遗忘请求，同时相比基线方法保持强大的LLM效用。

Conclusion: 提出的联邦遗忘方法具有可扩展性和隐私保护特性，能够有效解决大语言模型在现实应用中的遗忘需求挑战。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly integrated into real-world
applications, raising concerns about privacy, security and the need to remove
undesirable knowledge. Machine Unlearning has emerged as a promising solution,
yet faces two key challenges: (1) practical unlearning needs are often
continuous and heterogeneous, and (2) they involve decentralized, sensitive
data with asymmetric access. These factors result in inter-domain and
intra-domain interference, which further amplifies the dilemma of unbalanced
forgetting and retaining performance. In response, we propose a federated
unlearning approach for LLMs that is scalable and privacy preserving. Our
method decouples unlearning and retention via task-specific adapter learning
and employs a hierarchical merging strategy to mitigate conflicting objectives
and enables robust, adaptable unlearning updates. Comprehensive experiments on
benchmarks of WMDP, MUSE, and TOFU showed that our approach effectively handles
heterogeneous unlearning requests while maintaining strong LLM utility compared
with baseline methods.

### [8] [Long-Context Attention Benchmark: From Kernel Efficiency to Distributed Context Parallelism](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17896)
*Tao Bu,Qiangang Wang,Bowen Zeng,Hanwen Sun,Yunpeng Huang,Chun Cao,Jingwei Xu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一个统一的基准测试框架，用于系统评估长上下文LLM训练中的注意力机制，包括注意力内核优化和上下文并行策略，在96个GPU集群上进行全面实验。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的注意力机制评估存在局限性：算子级比较不完整，上下文并行策略通常是框架特定的，缺乏跨上下文的性能分析。需要系统性的评估来指导长上下文训练中注意力机制的设计和部署。

Method: 开发了一个统一的基准测试框架，集成了代表性的注意力内核和上下文并行机制，提供模块化和可扩展的接口。评估方法关注两个关键维度：注意力掩码模式和序列长度/分布式规模。

Result: 在最多96个GPU的集群上进行了全面实验，实现了可重复的比较，突出了方法特定的权衡，为长上下文LLM训练中注意力机制的设计和部署提供了实用指导。

Conclusion: 该基准测试框架填补了现有评估的空白，能够系统评估不同注意力机制在长上下文训练中的性能，为研究者和实践者提供了有价值的参考和指导。

Abstract: Transformer-based large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable
success, yet their standard attention mechanism incurs quadratic computation
and memory costs with respect to sequence length, posing a major bottleneck for
long-context training. Prior work tackles this challenge along two directions:
(1) kernel-level optimizations, which accelerate dense and sparse attention
operators; and (2) module-level strategies, often referred to as distributed
attention or context parallel training, which scale attention across multiple
devices. However, systematic evaluation still remains limited: operator-level
comparisons are often incomplete, while context parallel strategies are
typically framework-specific, with unclear performance analysis across
contexts. To address these gaps, we propose a unified benchmark that integrates
representative attention kernels and context parallel mechanisms with a modular
and extensible interface for evaluation. The benchmark evaluates methods along
two critical dimensions: (1) attention mask patterns, which strongly affect
efficiency, scalability, and usability, and (2) sequence length and distributed
scale, which determine performance under extreme long-context training. Through
comprehensive experiments on the cluster of up to 96 GPUs, our benchmark
enables reproducible comparisons, highlights method-specific trade-offs, and
provides practical guidance for designing and deploying attention mechanisms in
long-context LLM training.

### [9] [L-MoE: End-to-End Training of a Lightweight Mixture of Low-Rank Adaptation Experts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17898)
*Shihao Ji,Zihui Song*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: L-MoE：一种轻量级LoRA专家混合框架，将MoE架构与LoRA微调技术结合，用低秩适配器替代传统MoE专家，实现端到端可训练的参数高效模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 结合MoE架构的稀疏激活优势和LoRA的参数高效微调能力，构建可动态组合技能、模块化设计的轻量级语言模型。

Method: 将MoE专家重新定义为任务专用的低秩适配器集合，通过轻量级门控网络动态计算每个输入token的LoRA参数加权平均，实现完全可微的路由机制。

Result: 提出了L-MoE的正式数学框架，包括可微路由机制和联合优化目标，为构建更高效、可扩展和专用语言模型提供新路径。

Conclusion: L-MoE统一了MoE和LoRA两种范式，创建了参数高效、模块化设计、支持动态技能组合且端到端可训练的专家混合模型。

Abstract: The Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture enables the scaling of Large
Language Models (LLMs) to trillions of parameters by activating a sparse subset
of weights for each input, maintaining constant computational cost during
inference. Concurrently, Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has emerged as a dominant
technique for parameter-efficiently fine-tuning LLMs on specialized tasks. In
this work, we unify these two paradigms into a novel, end-to-end trainable
framework named L-MoE: a Lightweight Mixture of LoRA Experts. L-MoE redefines
MoE experts not as dense feed-forward networks, but as a collection of
task-specialized, low-rank adapters. A lightweight gating network, trained
jointly with the experts, learns to dynamically compose these LoRA adapters by
computing a weighted average of their parameters for each input token. This
composition is fully differentiable, allowing gradients from a standard
auto-regressive language modeling objective to flow back through the entire
architecture, simultaneously refining both the expert adapters and the routing
strategy. This approach creates a highly parameter-efficient MoE model that is
modular by design, allows for dynamic skill composition, and is trainable from
end-to-end. We present the formal mathematical framework for L-MoE, detailing
the differentiable routing mechanism and the joint optimization objective,
thereby providing a new path toward building more efficient, scalable, and
specialized language models.

### [10] [The Sherpa.ai Blind Vertical Federated Learning Paradigm to Minimize the Number of Communications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17901)
*Alex Acero,Daniel M. Jimenez-Gutierrez,Dario Pighin,Enrique Zuazua,Joaquin Del Rio,Xabi Uribe-Etxebarria*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出Sherpa.ai Blind Vertical Federated Learning (SBVFL)新范式，通过解耦节点更新与服务器通信，将垂直联邦学习的通信量减少约99%，同时保持准确性和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 垂直联邦学习(VFL)存在通信量过大的问题，这会损害隐私安全、导致高能耗，在某些情况下甚至使模型训练不可行。

Method: 采用分布式训练机制，将大部分节点更新与服务器解耦，显著减少节点与服务器之间的通信。

Result: 实验显示SBVFL相比标准VFL减少了约99%的通信量，同时保持了准确性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: SBVFL使得在医疗、金融、制造、航空航天、网络安全和国防等敏感领域的实用隐私保护垂直联邦学习成为可能。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative decentralized training across
multiple parties (nodes) while keeping raw data private. There are two main
paradigms in FL: Horizontal FL (HFL), where all participant nodes share the
same feature space but hold different samples, and Vertical FL (VFL), where
participants hold complementary features for the same samples. While HFL is
widely adopted, VFL is employed in domains where nodes hold complementary
features about the same samples. Still, VFL presents a significant limitation:
the vast number of communications required during training. This compromises
privacy and security, and can lead to high energy consumption, and in some
cases, make model training unfeasible due to the high number of communications.
  In this paper, we introduce Sherpa.ai Blind Vertical Federated Learning
(SBVFL), a novel paradigm that leverages a distributed training mechanism
enhanced for privacy and security. Decoupling the vast majority of node updates
from the server dramatically reduces node-server communication. Experiments
show that SBVFL reduces communication by ~99% compared to standard VFL while
maintaining accuracy and robustness. Therefore, SBVFL enables practical,
privacy-preserving VFL across sensitive domains, including healthcare, finance,
manufacturing, aerospace, cybersecurity, and the defense industry.

### [11] [Automated Algorithm Design for Auto-Tuning Optimizers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17899)
*Floris-Jan Willemsen,Niki van Stein,Ben van Werkhoven*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 使用大语言模型自动生成针对自动调优问题的优化算法，这些生成的算法在真实调优应用中能媲美甚至超越人工设计的优化器。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动性能调优对高性能应用至关重要，但设计有效的优化器具有挑战性，因为没有一个单一方法在所有调优任务中表现最佳。

Method: 提出一个框架，通过向LLM提供问题描述和搜索空间特征来生成专门的优化策略，并进行迭代检查和改进。

Result: 在四个真实世界自动调优应用和六个硬件平台上评估，LLM生成的优化器平均性能提升30.7%和14.6%，最佳生成算法平均比最先进优化器提升72.4%。

Conclusion: LLM生成的优化算法能够有效替代传统人工设计的优化器，在自动调优任务中表现出色。

Abstract: Automatic performance tuning (auto-tuning) is essential for optimizing
high-performance applications, where vast and irregular parameter spaces make
manual exploration infeasible. Traditionally, auto-tuning relies on
well-established optimization algorithms such as evolutionary algorithms,
annealing methods, or surrogate model-based optimizers to efficiently find
near-optimal configurations. However, designing effective optimizers remains
challenging, as no single method performs best across all tuning tasks.
  In this work, we explore a new paradigm: using large language models (LLMs)
to automatically generate optimization algorithms tailored to auto-tuning
problems. We introduce a framework that prompts LLMs with problem descriptions
and search-space characteristics results to produce specialized optimization
strategies, which are iteratively examined and improved.
  These generated algorithms are evaluated on four real-world auto-tuning
applications across six hardware platforms and compared against the
state-of-the-art in optimization algorithms of two contemporary auto-tuning
frameworks. The evaluation demonstrates that providing additional application-
and search space-specific information in the generation stage results in an
average performance improvement of 30.7\% and 14.6\%, respectively. In
addition, our results show that LLM-generated optimizers can rival, and in
various cases outperform, existing human-designed algorithms, with our
best-performing generated optimization algorithms achieving, on average, 72.4\%
improvement over state-of-the-art optimizers for auto-tuning.

### [12] [Efficient Long-context Language Model Training by Core Attention Disaggregation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18121)
*Yonghao Zhuang,Junda Chen,Bo Pang,Yi Gu,Yibo Zhu,Yimin Jiang,Ion Stoica,Eric Xing,Hao Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出核心注意力解耦(CAD)技术，通过将核心注意力计算与模型其他部分分离并在专用设备上执行，解决长上下文训练中的负载不平衡问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有系统中核心注意力与其他层共存，在长上下文场景下其二次计算增长导致数据并行和流水线并行组中的负载不平衡和拖尾问题。

Method: 将核心注意力分解为token级任务，调度到专用注意力服务器，动态重新批处理任务以平衡计算而不牺牲内核效率。

Result: 在512个H200 GPU和512k token上下文长度下，DistCA系统将端到端训练吞吐量提升1.35倍，消除拖尾问题，实现近乎完美的计算和内存平衡。

Conclusion: CAD技术通过解耦核心注意力计算有效解决了长上下文训练中的负载不平衡问题，显著提升了训练效率。

Abstract: We present core attention disaggregation (CAD), a technique that improves
long-context large language model training by decoupling the core attention
computation, softmax(QK^T)V, from the rest of the model and executing it on a
separate pool of devices. In existing systems, core attention is colocated with
other layers; at long context lengths, its quadratic compute growth compared to
the near-linear growth of other components causes load imbalance and stragglers
across data and pipeline parallel groups. CAD is enabled by two observations.
First, core attention is stateless: it has no trainable parameters and only
minimal transient data, so balancing reduces to scheduling compute-bound tasks.
Second, it is composable: modern attention kernels retain high efficiency when
processing fused batches of token-level shards with arbitrary lengths. CAD
partitions core attention into token-level tasks and dispatches them to
dedicated attention servers, which dynamically rebatch tasks to equalize
compute without sacrificing kernel efficiency. We implement CAD in a system
called DistCA, which uses a ping-pong execution scheme to fully overlap
communication with computation and in-place execution on attention servers to
reduce memory use. On 512 H200 GPUs and context lengths up to 512k tokens,
DistCA improves end-to-end training throughput by up to 1.35x, eliminates data
and pipeline parallel stragglers, and achieves near-perfect compute and memory
balance.

neural compression and representation learning in the context of Earth
Observation (EO). Our approach builds on fixed-size embeddings that act as
compact, task-agnostic representations applicable to a broad range of
downstream tasks. NeuCo-Bench comprises three core components: (i) an
evaluation pipeline built around reusable embeddings, (ii) a new challenge mode
with a hidden-task leaderboard designed to mitigate pretraining bias, and (iii)
a scoring system that balances accuracy and stability. To support
reproducibility, we release SSL4EO-S12-downstream, a curated multispectral,
multitemporal EO dataset. We present initial results from a public challenge at
the 2025 CVPR EARTHVISION workshop and conduct ablations with state-of-the-art
foundation models. NeuCo-Bench provides a first step towards community-driven,
standardized evaluation of neural embeddings for EO and beyond.

### [14] [Uncertainty-Aware Post-Hoc Calibration: Mitigating Confidently Incorrect Predictions Beyond Calibration Metrics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17915)
*Hassan Gharoun,Mohammad Sadegh Khorshidi,Kasra Ranjbarigderi,Fang Chen,Amir H. Gandomi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于预测可靠性评估的后处理校准框架，通过语义相似性将样本分为正确和错误预测组，分别应用标准等渗回归和欠置信正则化等渗回归，同时提升校准质量和不确定性感知决策能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有神经网路校准方法通常应用全局变换，忽视了预测的异质性可靠性，且校准改进与不确定性感知决策之间的关系尚未充分探索。

Method: 使用基于邻近性的共形预测将校准样本按特征空间语义相似性分层为正确和错误预测组，对正确预测应用标准等渗回归，对错误预测应用欠置信正则化等渗回归降低置信度。

Result: 在CIFAR-10和CIFAR-100数据集上的实验表明，该方法减少了自信错误预测，在预期校准误差方面与基线方法竞争，同时改善了不确定性感知决策。

Conclusion: 该工作通过实例级自适应性连接了校准和不确定性量化，提供了一种无需模型重训练的后处理解决方案，同时改善了概率对齐和不确定性感知决策。

Abstract: Despite extensive research on neural network calibration, existing methods
typically apply global transformations that treat all predictions uniformly,
overlooking the heterogeneous reliability of individual predictions.
Furthermore, the relationship between improved calibration and effective
uncertainty-aware decision-making remains largely unexplored. This paper
presents a post-hoc calibration framework that leverages prediction reliability
assessment to jointly enhance calibration quality and uncertainty-aware
decision-making. The framework employs proximity-based conformal prediction to
stratify calibration samples into putatively correct and putatively incorrect
groups based on semantic similarity in feature space. A dual calibration
strategy is then applied: standard isotonic regression calibrated confidence in
putatively correct predictions, while underconfidence-regularized isotonic
regression reduces confidence toward uniform distributions for putatively
incorrect predictions, facilitating their identification for further
investigations. A comprehensive evaluation is conducted using calibration
metrics, uncertainty-aware performance measures, and empirical conformal
coverage. Experiments on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 with BiT and CoAtNet backbones
show that the proposed method achieves lower confidently incorrect predictions,
and competitive Expected Calibration Error compared with isotonic and
focal-loss baselines. This work bridges calibration and uncertainty
quantification through instance-level adaptivity, offering a practical post-hoc
solution that requires no model retraining while improving both probability
alignment and uncertainty-aware decision-making.

Abstract: Data unlearning aims to remove the influence of specific training samples
from a trained model without requiring full retraining. Unlike concept
unlearning, data unlearning in diffusion models remains underexplored and often
suffers from quality degradation or incomplete forgetting. To address this, we
first observe that most existing methods attempt to unlearn the samples at all
diffusion time steps equally, leading to poor-quality generation. We argue that
forgetting occurs disproportionately across time and frequency, depending on
the model and scenarios. By selectively focusing on specific time-frequency
ranges during training, we achieve samples with higher aesthetic quality and
lower noise. We validate this improvement by applying our time-frequency
selective approach to diverse settings, including gradient-based and preference
optimization objectives, as well as both image-level and text-to-image tasks.
Finally, to evaluate both deletion and quality of unlearned data samples, we
propose a simple normalized version of SSCD. Together, our analysis and methods
establish a clearer understanding of the unique challenges in data unlearning
for diffusion models, providing practical strategies to improve both evaluation
and unlearning performance.

TL;DR: COMPASS是一种无需外部监督的测试时奖励机制，通过双校准答案奖励和决定性路径奖励来增强语言模型的推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前强化学习方法存在可扩展性瓶颈，过度依赖人工标注的偏好数据或标记数据集进行奖励建模。

Method: 提出COMPASS框架，包含双校准答案奖励(DCAR)和决定性路径奖励(DPR)，分别通过置信度和可信度校准建立可靠伪标签，以及直接优化推理过程质量。

Result: 在多样化推理任务和模型架构上实现了显著且一致的性能提升。

Conclusion: COMPASS为语言模型从连续经验中学习提供了更可扩展的方向。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for advancing
Large Language Models (LLMs), achieving remarkable performance in complex
reasoning domains such as mathematics and code generation. However, current RL
methods face a fundamental scalability bottleneck due to their heavy reliance
on human-curated preference data or labeled datasets for reward modeling. To
overcome this limitation, we explore RL on unlabeled data where models learn
autonomously from continuous experience streams. The core challenge in this
setting lies in reliable reward estimation without ground-truth supervision.
Existing approaches like Test-Time RL address this through self-consistent
consensus, but risk reinforcing incorrect pseudo-labels derived from majority
voting. We introduce COMPASS (Composite Path and Answer Self-Scoring), a novel
test-time reward mechanism that operates without external supervision. COMPASS
integrates two complementary components: the Dual-Calibration Answer Reward
(DCAR), which stabilizes training by establishing trustworthy pseudo-labels
through confidence and credibility calibration, and the Decisive Path Reward
(DPR), which directly optimizes the reasoning process quality beyond mere
outcome supervision. By jointly reinforcing trustworthy consensus answers and
highly decisive reasoning chains, the COMPASS systematically enhances the
model's analytical capabilities. Extensive experiments show that COMPASS
achieves significant and consistent performance gains across diverse reasoning
tasks and model architectures, advancing a more scalable direction for LLMs to
learn from continuous experience.

Conclusion: 该框架将过滤升级为原则性合成，可靠地组装连贯可验证的训练实例，无需领域特定规则即可泛化，为可验证数据合成提供了通用解决方案。

Abstract: Reliable verifiable data has become a key driver of capability gains in
modern language models, enabling stable reinforcement learning with verifiable
rewards and effective distillation that transfers competence across math,
coding, and agentic tasks. Yet constructing generalizable synthetic verifiable
data remains difficult due to hallucination-prone generation, and weak or
trivial verification artifacts that fail to separate strong from weak
solutions. Existing approaches often rely on task-specific heuristics or
post-hoc filters that do not transfer across domains and lack a principled,
universal evaluator of verifiability. In this work, we introduce an
evolutionary, task-agnostic, strategy-guided, executably-checkable data
synthesis framework that, from minimal seed supervision, jointly synthesizes
problems, diverse candidate solutions, and verification artifacts, and
iteratively discovers strategies via a consistency-based evaluator that
enforces agreement between human-annotated and strategy-induced checks. This
pipeline upgrades filtering into principled synthesis: it reliably assembles
coherent, verifiable training instances and generalizes without domain-specific
rules. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach
under both RLVR and model distillation training paradigms. The results show
that training with our synthesized data yields significant improvements on both
the LiveCodeBench and AgentBench-OS tasks, highlighting the robust
generalization of our framework.

Motivation: 在混沌时间序列中检测状态转换很困难，因为观测空间信号与内在变异性纠缠在一起。

Method: 两阶段框架：首先使用基于模拟推理训练的神经后验估计器进行贝叶斯参数推断，然后对得到的参数轨迹应用标准变点检测算法。

Conclusion: 在物理可解释的参数空间中操作，能够在非线性动力系统中实现准确且可解释的变点检测。

Abstract: Detecting regime shifts in chaotic time series is hard because
observation-space signals are entangled with intrinsic variability. We propose
Parameter--Space Changepoint Detection (Param--CPD), a two--stage framework
that first amortizes Bayesian inference of governing parameters with a neural
posterior estimator trained by simulation-based inference, and then applies a
standard CPD algorithm to the resulting parameter trajectory. On Lorenz--63
with piecewise-constant parameters, Param--CPD improves F1, reduces
localization error, and lowers false positives compared to observation--space
baselines. We further verify identifiability and calibration of the inferred
posteriors on stationary trajectories, explaining why parameter space offers a
cleaner detection signal. Robustness analyses over tolerance, window length,
and noise indicate consistent gains. Our results show that operating in a
physically interpretable parameter space enables accurate and interpretable
changepoint detection in nonlinear dynamical systems.

*Jaihoon Kim,Rajarshi Saha,Minhyuk Sung,Youngsuk Park*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文分析了Transition Matching(TM)何时及为何优于Flow Matching(FM)，证明在单峰高斯分布下TM获得更低的KL散度，在计算预算固定时收敛更快，在模式分离良好的高斯混合分布中TM表现更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然Flow Matching支撑了许多最先进的生成模型，但近期结果表明Transition Matching可以用更少的采样步骤获得更高质量。本文旨在回答TM何时以及为何优于FM的问题。

Method: 首先在单峰高斯分布下证明TM获得严格更低的KL散度，分析收敛速率；然后扩展到高斯混合分布，识别局部单峰性机制；最后通过高斯分布上的受控实验和图像视频生成的实际应用验证理论结果。

Result: 在单峰高斯分布下，TM通过随机差异潜在更新保留目标协方差，获得比FM更低的KL散度；在高斯混合分布中，当模式分离良好且方差不可忽略时TM表现更优；当目标方差趋近于零时，TM的性能优势减弱。

Conclusion: TM在目标分布具有良好分离的模式和不可忽略的方差时优于FM，这为在实际应用中选择合适的生成模型提供了理论指导。

Abstract: Flow Matching (FM) underpins many state-of-the-art generative models, yet
recent results indicate that Transition Matching (TM) can achieve higher
quality with fewer sampling steps. This work answers the question of when and
why TM outperforms FM. First, when the target is a unimodal Gaussian
distribution, we prove that TM attains strictly lower KL divergence than FM for
finite number of steps. The improvement arises from stochastic difference
latent updates in TM, which preserve target covariance that deterministic FM
underestimates. We then characterize convergence rates, showing that TM
achieves faster convergence than FM under a fixed compute budget, establishing
its advantage in the unimodal Gaussian setting. Second, we extend the analysis
to Gaussian mixtures and identify local-unimodality regimes in which the
sampling dynamics approximate the unimodal case, where TM can outperform FM.
The approximation error decreases as the minimal distance between component
means increases, highlighting that TM is favored when the modes are well
separated. However, when the target variance approaches zero, each TM update
converges to the FM update, and the performance advantage of TM diminishes. In
summary, we show that TM outperforms FM when the target distribution has
well-separated modes and non-negligible variances. We validate our theoretical
results with controlled experiments on Gaussian distributions, and extend the
comparison to real-world applications in image and video generation.

TL;DR: 提出了A-DATSC模型，结合深度子空间聚类生成器和质量验证判别器，用于处理多变量时空数据的复杂非线性流形聚类问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度子空间聚类方法存在多个局限：使用浅层自编码器忽略聚类误差、强调全局特征而忽略局部结构、无法建模长程依赖和位置信息、很少应用于4D时空数据。

Method: 采用U-Net启发的生成器，通过堆叠TimeDistributed ConvLSTM2D层保持时空完整性；使用图注意力变换器的自表达网络捕获局部空间关系、全局依赖和长短程相关性；结合质量验证判别器。

Result: 在三个真实世界多变量时空数据集上的实验表明，A-DATSC相比最先进的深度子空间聚类模型实现了显著优越的聚类性能。

Conclusion: A-DATSC模型有效解决了现有方法的局限性，在复杂时空数据聚类任务中表现出色。

Abstract: Deep subspace clustering models are vital for applications such as snowmelt
detection, sea ice tracking, crop health monitoring, infectious disease
modeling, network load prediction, and land-use planning, where multivariate
spatiotemporal data exhibit complex temporal dependencies and reside on
multiple nonlinear manifolds beyond the capability of traditional clustering
methods. These models project data into a latent space where samples lie in
linear subspaces and exploit the self-expressiveness property to uncover
intrinsic relationships. Despite their success, existing methods face major
limitations: they use shallow autoencoders that ignore clustering errors,
emphasize global features while neglecting local structure, fail to model
long-range dependencies and positional information, and are rarely applied to
4D spatiotemporal data. To address these issues, we propose A-DATSC
(Attention-Guided Deep Adversarial Temporal Subspace Clustering), a model
combining a deep subspace clustering generator and a quality-verifying
discriminator. The generator, inspired by U-Net, preserves spatial and temporal
integrity through stacked TimeDistributed ConvLSTM2D layers, reducing
parameters and enhancing generalization. A graph attention transformer based
self-expressive network captures local spatial relationships, global
dependencies, and both short- and long-range correlations. Experiments on three
real-world multivariate spatiotemporal datasets show that A-DATSC achieves
substantially superior clustering performance compared to state-of-the-art deep
subspace clustering models.

Abstract: Neural activity forecasting is central to understanding neural systems and
enabling closed-loop control. While deep learning has recently advanced the
state-of-the-art in the time series forecasting literature, its application to
neural activity forecasting remains limited. To bridge this gap, we
systematically evaluated eight probabilistic deep learning models, including
two foundation models, that have demonstrated strong performance on general
forecasting benchmarks. We compared them against four classical statistical
models and two baseline methods on spontaneous neural activity recorded from
mouse cortex via widefield imaging. Across prediction horizons, several deep
learning models consistently outperformed classical approaches, with the best
model producing informative forecasts up to 1.5 seconds into the future. Our
findings point toward future control applications and open new avenues for
probing the intrinsic temporal structure of neural activity.

Conclusion: 该框架建立了跨域算子推断的通用原则，能够在物理、气候和能源系统中实现复杂时空场的实时预测。

Abstract: Forecasting unobservable physical quantities from sparse, cross-domain sensor
data is a central unsolved problem in scientific machine learning. Existing
neural operators and large-scale forecasters rely on dense, co-located
input-output fields and short temporal contexts, assumptions that fail in
real-world systems where sensing and prediction occur on distinct physical
manifolds and over long timescales. We introduce the Spatio-Temporal Operator
Network (STONe), a non-autoregressive neural operator that learns a stable
functional mapping between heterogeneous domains. By directly inferring
high-altitude radiation dose fields from sparse ground-based neutron
measurements, STONe demonstrates that operator learning can generalize beyond
shared-domain settings. It defines a nonlinear operator between sensor and
target manifolds that remains stable over long forecasting horizons without
iterative recurrence. This challenges the conventional view that operator
learning requires domain alignment or autoregressive propagation. Trained on 23
years of global neutron data, STONe achieves accurate 180-day forecasts with
millisecond inference latency. The framework establishes a general principle
for cross-domain operator inference, enabling real-time prediction of complex
spatiotemporal fields in physics, climate, and energy systems.

Conclusion: ACIA为反因果学习提供了有效的理论保证，建立了训练与未见环境间性能差距的严格界限，证实了该方法的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Causal representation learning in the anti-causal setting (labels cause
features rather than the reverse) presents unique challenges requiring
specialized approaches. We propose Anti-Causal Invariant Abstractions (ACIA), a
novel measure-theoretic framework for anti-causal representation learning. ACIA
employs a two-level design, low-level representations capture how labels
generate observations, while high-level representations learn stable causal
patterns across environment-specific variations. ACIA addresses key limitations
of existing approaches by accommodating prefect and imperfect interventions
through interventional kernels, eliminating dependency on explicit causal
structures, handling high-dimensional data effectively, and providing
theoretical guarantees for out-of-distribution generalization. Experiments on
synthetic and real-world medical datasets demonstrate that ACIA consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both accuracy and invariance metrics.
Furthermore, our theoretical results establish tight bounds on performance gaps
between training and unseen environments, confirming the efficacy of our
approach for robust anti-causal learning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法使用固定正则化强度，导致强正则化限制奖励优化，弱正则化引发不稳定或奖励黑客问题，需要更智能的探索-利用平衡机制。

Method: 基于优势估计自适应调整正则化强度：对高价值样本减少正则化，对低质量样本加强正则化，结合Wasserstein-2正则化用于流匹配生成模型。

Result: 在文本到图像生成中，2B参数的SD3模型超越4.8B和12B参数模型；在LLM微调中展现逃离局部最优能力；在多模态音频推理中，7B模型超越Gemini 2.5 Pro和GPT-4o Audio。

Conclusion: ADRPO为不同生成架构和模态提供了有效的即插即用解决方案，解决了探索-利用挑战，在保持生成多样性的同时实现更好的语义对齐。

Abstract: Balancing exploration and exploitation during reinforcement learning
fine-tuning of generative models presents a critical challenge, as existing
approaches rely on fixed divergence regularization that creates an inherent
dilemma: strong regularization preserves model capabilities but limits reward
optimization, while weak regularization enables greater alignment but risks
instability or reward hacking. We introduce Adaptive Divergence Regularized
Policy Optimization (ADRPO), which automatically adjusts regularization
strength based on advantage estimates-reducing regularization for high-value
samples while applying stronger regularization to poor samples, enabling
policies to navigate between exploration and aggressive exploitation according
to data quality. Our implementation with Wasserstein-2 regularization for flow
matching generative models achieves remarkable results on text-to-image
generation, achieving better semantic alignment and diversity than offline
methods like DPO and online methods with fixed regularization like ORW-CFM-W2.
ADRPO enables a 2B parameter SD3 model to surpass much larger models with 4.8B
and 12B parameters in attribute binding, semantic consistency, artistic style
transfer, and compositional control while maintaining generation diversity.
ADRPO generalizes to KL-regularized fine-tuning of both text-only LLMs and
multi-modal reasoning models, enhancing existing online RL methods like GRPO.
In LLM fine-tuning, ADRPO demonstrates an emergent ability to escape local
optima through active exploration, while in multi-modal audio reasoning, it
outperforms GRPO through superior step-by-step reasoning, enabling a 7B model
to outperform substantially larger commercial models including Gemini 2.5 Pro
and GPT-4o Audio, offering an effective plug-and-play solution to the
exploration-exploitation challenge across diverse generative architectures and
modalities.

Motivation: 开发自动驾驶需要真实、类人且具有社会意识的驾驶行为。现有模仿学习方法计算昂贵、推理慢，而自强化学习方法虽然可扩展但容易偏离人类规范。

Conclusion: SPACeR建立了测试自动驾驶策略的新范式，通过结合生成模型和强化学习的优势，实现了快速、可扩展且类人的交通模拟。

Abstract: Developing autonomous vehicles (AVs) requires not only safety and efficiency,
but also realistic, human-like behaviors that are socially aware and
predictable. Achieving this requires sim agent policies that are human-like,
fast, and scalable in multi-agent settings. Recent progress in imitation
learning with large diffusion-based or tokenized models has shown that
behaviors can be captured directly from human driving data, producing realistic
policies. However, these models are computationally expensive, slow during
inference, and struggle to adapt in reactive, closed-loop scenarios. In
contrast, self-play reinforcement learning (RL) scales efficiently and
naturally captures multi-agent interactions, but it often relies on heuristics
and reward shaping, and the resulting policies can diverge from human norms. We
propose SPACeR, a framework that leverages a pretrained tokenized
autoregressive motion model as a centralized reference policy to guide
decentralized self-play. The reference model provides likelihood rewards and KL
divergence, anchoring policies to the human driving distribution while
preserving RL scalability. Evaluated on the Waymo Sim Agents Challenge, our
method achieves competitive performance with imitation-learned policies while
being up to 10x faster at inference and 50x smaller in parameter size than
large generative models. In addition, we demonstrate in closed-loop ego
planning evaluation tasks that our sim agents can effectively measure planner
quality with fast and scalable traffic simulation, establishing a new paradigm
for testing autonomous driving policies.

Motivation: 现有的流式生成模型在基于中间反馈进行微调时面临挑战，特别是连续时间流匹配模型。大多数方法仅从结果奖励中学习，难以解决信用分配问题，而通过直接回归累积奖励学习评论家的方法则面临训练不稳定和模型崩溃的问题。

Conclusion: AC-Flow提供了一个稳健的actor-critic框架，成功解决了流匹配模型在基于中间反馈微调中的挑战，实现了稳定的训练和高质量的文本到图像生成。

Abstract: Flow-based generative models have shown remarkable success in text-to-image
generation, yet fine-tuning them with intermediate feedback remains
challenging, especially for continuous-time flow matching models. Most existing
approaches solely learn from outcome rewards, struggling with the credit
assignment problem. Alternative methods that attempt to learn a critic via
direct regression on cumulative rewards often face training instabilities and
model collapse in online settings. We present AC-Flow, a robust actor-critic
framework that addresses these challenges through three key innovations: (1)
reward shaping that provides well-normalized learning signals to enable stable
intermediate value learning and gradient control, (2) a novel dual-stability
mechanism that combines advantage clipping to prevent destructive policy
updates with a warm-up phase that allows the critic to mature before
influencing the actor, and (3) a scalable generalized critic weighting scheme
that extends traditional reward-weighted methods while preserving model
diversity through Wasserstein regularization. Through extensive experiments on
Stable Diffusion 3, we demonstrate that AC-Flow achieves state-of-the-art
performance in text-to-image alignment tasks and generalization to unseen human
preference models. Our results demonstrate that even with a computationally
efficient critic model, we can robustly finetune flow models without
compromising generative quality, diversity, or stability.

Abstract: In this work, we address the problem of determining reliable policies in
reinforcement learning (RL), with a focus on optimization under uncertainty and
the need for performance guarantees. While classical RL algorithms aim at
maximizing the expected return, many real-world applications - such as routing,
resource allocation, or sequential decision-making under risk - require
strategies that ensure not only high average performance but also a guaranteed
probability of success. To this end, we propose a novel formulation in which
the objective is to maximize the probability that the cumulative return exceeds
a prescribed threshold. We demonstrate that this reliable RL problem can be
reformulated, via a state-augmented representation, into a standard RL problem,
thereby allowing the use of existing RL and deep RL algorithms without the need
for entirely new algorithmic frameworks. Theoretical results establish the
equivalence of the two formulations and show that reliable strategies can be
derived by appropriately adapting well-known methods such as Q-learning or
Dueling Double DQN. To illustrate the practical relevance of the approach, we
consider the problem of reliable routing, where the goal is not to minimize the
expected travel time but rather to maximize the probability of reaching the
destination within a given time budget. Numerical experiments confirm that the
proposed formulation leads to policies that effectively balance efficiency and
reliability, highlighting the potential of reliable RL for applications in
stochastic and safety-critical environments.

Abstract: Machine learning (ML) holds great potential to advance anomaly detection (AD)
in chemical processes. However, the development of ML-based methods is hindered
by the lack of openly available experimental data. To address this gap, we have
set up a laboratory-scale batch distillation plant and operated it to generate
an extensive experimental database, covering fault-free experiments and
experiments in which anomalies were intentionally induced, for training
advanced ML-based AD methods. In total, 119 experiments were conducted across a
wide range of operating conditions and mixtures. Most experiments containing
anomalies were paired with a corresponding fault-free one. The database that we
provide here includes time-series data from numerous sensors and actuators,
along with estimates of measurement uncertainty. In addition, unconventional
data sources -- such as concentration profiles obtained via online benchtop NMR
spectroscopy and video and audio recordings -- are provided. Extensive metadata
and expert annotations of all experiments are included. The anomaly annotations
are based on an ontology developed in this work. The data are organized in a
structured database and made freely available via
doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.17395544. This new database paves the way for the
development of advanced ML-based AD methods. As it includes information on the
causes of anomalies, it further enables the development of interpretable and
explainable ML approaches, as well as methods for anomaly mitigation.

TL;DR: MEG-GPT：基于Transformer的脑磁图基础模型，使用时间注意力和下一时间点预测，能够生成具有真实时空特性的大脑动态数据，并在下游解码任务中表现优异。


<details>

Motivation: 传统方法无法有效捕捉脑磁图等大规模脑动态数据的复杂时空模式，而深度学习在语言和视觉领域的成功表明基础模型在大规模数据建模方面的潜力。

Method: 提出MEG-GPT模型，使用时间注意力和下一时间点预测；开发新型数据驱动的连续MEG数据分词器，保持高时间分辨率；在大型MEG数据集（N=612）上训练模型。

Abstract: Modelling the complex spatiotemporal patterns of large-scale brain dynamics
is crucial for neuroscience, but traditional methods fail to capture the rich
structure in modalities such as magnetoencephalography (MEG). Recent advances
in deep learning have enabled significant progress in other domains, such as
language and vision, by using foundation models at scale. Here, we introduce
MEG-GPT, a transformer based foundation model that uses time-attention and next
time-point prediction. To facilitate this, we also introduce a novel
data-driven tokeniser for continuous MEG data, which preserves the high
temporal resolution of continuous MEG signals without lossy transformations. We
trained MEG-GPT on tokenised brain region time-courses extracted from a
large-scale MEG dataset (N=612, eyes-closed rest, Cam-CAN data), and show that
the learnt model can generate data with realistic spatio-spectral properties,
including transient events and population variability. Critically, it performs
well in downstream decoding tasks, improving downstream supervised prediction
task, showing improved zero-shot generalisation across sessions (improving
accuracy from 0.54 to 0.59) and subjects (improving accuracy from 0.41 to 0.49)
compared to a baseline methods. Furthermore, we show the model can be
efficiently fine-tuned on a smaller labelled dataset to boost performance in
cross-subject decoding scenarios. This work establishes a powerful foundation
model for electrophysiological data, paving the way for applications in
computational neuroscience and neural decoding.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ADA是一种推理时防御方法，通过重新引入助手头令牌来解锁LLMs的浅层对齐能力，确保在任意生成深度都能保持安全性，无需修改基础模型参数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型存在浅层对齐问题：在助手回合开始时能直接拒绝有害查询，但一旦有害内容开始生成，这种保护就会崩溃。需要确保模型在任意生成深度都能保持安全性。

Method: 提出Any-Depth Alignment (ADA)方法，基于观察到对齐能力集中在助手头令牌中。通过在生成过程中重新引入这些令牌，诱导模型重新评估有害性并在任意点恢复拒绝能力。

Result: 在多个开源模型家族上，ADA实现了近乎100%的拒绝率对抗对抗性预填充攻击，将主要对抗提示攻击的平均成功率降至3%以下，同时保持良性任务的实用性。

Conclusion: ADA提供了一种有效的推理时防御方案，能够解锁LLMs的固有浅层对齐能力，确保在任意生成深度都能保持安全性，且对基础模型参数无要求。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit strong but shallow alignment: they
directly refuse harmful queries when a refusal is expected at the very start of
an assistant turn, yet this protection collapses once a harmful continuation is
underway (either through the adversarial attacks or via harmful
assistant-prefill attacks). This raises a fundamental question: Can the innate
shallow alignment in LLMs be unlocked to ensure safety at arbitrary generation
depths? To achieve this goal, we propose Any-Depth Alignment (ADA), an
effective inference-time defense with negligible overhead. ADA is built based
on our observation that alignment is concentrated in the assistant header
tokens through repeated use in shallow-refusal training, and these tokens
possess the model's strong alignment priors. By reintroducing these tokens
mid-stream, ADA induces the model to reassess harmfulness and recover refusals
at any point in generation. Across diverse open-source model families (Llama,
Gemma, Mistral, Qwen, DeepSeek, and gpt-oss), ADA achieves robust safety
performance without requiring any changes to the base model's parameters. It
secures a near-100% refusal rate against challenging adversarial prefill
attacks ranging from dozens to thousands of tokens. Furthermore, ADA reduces
the average success rate of prominent adversarial prompt attacks (such as GCG,
AutoDAN, PAIR, and TAP) to below 3%. This is all accomplished while preserving
utility on benign tasks with minimal over-refusal. ADA maintains this
resilience even after the base model undergoes subsequent instruction tuning
(benign or adversarial).

TL;DR: 本文证明了在强化学习中，使用足够宽松的安全过滤器强制执行安全性不会降低渐近性能，从而实现了安全性与性能的完全分离。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 强化学习在复杂任务中应用广泛，但缺乏正式的安全保证限制了其在安全关键场景中的使用。安全过滤器虽然常用，但通常被认为会牺牲性能和阻碍学习过程。

Method: 定义了安全关键马尔可夫决策过程（SC-MDP）和相关的过滤MDP，其中安全过滤器被视为环境的一部分。证明了在过滤MDP中学习是安全的，且标准RL收敛性仍然成立。

Result: 在Safety Gymnasium上的实验验证了理论，训练过程中零违规，最终性能匹配或超过了无过滤基线。

Conclusion: 为安全RL提供了一个简单而原则性的方法：使用可用的最宽松安全过滤器来训练和部署RL策略。

Abstract: Recent advances in reinforcement learning (RL) enable its use on increasingly
complex tasks, but the lack of formal safety guarantees still limits its
application in safety-critical settings. A common practical approach is to
augment the RL policy with a safety filter that overrides unsafe actions to
prevent failures during both training and deployment. However, safety filtering
is often perceived as sacrificing performance and hindering the learning
process. We show that this perceived safety-performance tradeoff is not
inherent and prove, for the first time, that enforcing safety with a
sufficiently permissive safety filter does not degrade asymptotic performance.
We formalize RL safety with a safety-critical Markov decision process (SC-MDP),
which requires categorical, rather than high-probability, avoidance of
catastrophic failure states. Additionally, we define an associated filtered MDP
in which all actions result in safe effects, thanks to a safety filter that is
considered to be a part of the environment. Our main theorem establishes that
(i) learning in the filtered MDP is safe categorically, (ii) standard RL
convergence carries over to the filtered MDP, and (iii) any policy that is
optimal in the filtered MDP-when executed through the same filter-achieves the
same asymptotic return as the best safe policy in the SC-MDP, yielding a
complete separation between safety enforcement and performance optimization. We
validate the theory on Safety Gymnasium with representative tasks and
constraints, observing zero violations during training and final performance
matching or exceeding unfiltered baselines. Together, these results shed light
on a long-standing question in safety-filtered learning and provide a simple,
principled recipe for safe RL: train and deploy RL policies with the most
permissive safety filter that is available.

Motivation: ICU患者院内死亡率的准确早期预测对于及时临床干预和资源分配至关重要。

Method: 使用LASSO和XGBoost进行特征选择，然后基于两种模型识别出的重要特征训练多元逻辑回归模型，整合TF-IDF和BERT嵌入的文本特征。

Result: 结合结构化和文本输入的最终逻辑回归模型AUC达到0.918，相比仅使用结构化数据的0.753，相对提升22%。决策曲线分析显示在广泛阈值概率范围内具有优越的标准化净收益。

Conclusion: 非结构化临床笔记具有额外的预后价值，应整合到可解释的特征驱动风险预测模型中用于ICU患者。

Abstract: Accurate early prediction of in-hospital mortality in intensive care units
(ICUs) is essential for timely clinical intervention and efficient resource
allocation. This study develops and evaluates machine learning models that
integrate both structured clinical data and unstructured textual information,
specifically discharge summaries and radiology reports, from the MIMIC-IV
database. We used LASSO and XGBoost for feature selection, followed by a
multivariate logistic regression trained on the top features identified by both
models. Incorporating textual features using TF-IDF and BERT embeddings
significantly improved predictive performance. The final logistic regression
model, which combined structured and textual input, achieved an AUC of 0.918,
compared to 0.753 when using structured data alone, a relative improvement 22%.
The analysis of the decision curve demonstrated a superior standardized net
benefit in a wide range of threshold probabilities (0.2-0.8), confirming the
clinical utility of the model. These results underscore the added prognostic
value of unstructured clinical notes and support their integration into
interpretable feature-driven risk prediction models for ICU patients.

TL;DR: 提出潜在离散扩散模型(LDDMs)，通过将离散token的掩码扩散与连续潜在嵌入扩散相结合，改善少步生成质量


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统掩码去噪器在反向转换时位置间因子化的问题，这种因子化会削弱联合结构并在少步生成时降低质量

Method: 提出两种实现：FUJI-LDDMs（完全联合去噪token和潜在变量）和SEQ-LDDMs（先解析潜在变量，再条件解析离散链），并推导ELBO目标函数

Result: 在无条件生成指标上优于最先进的掩码离散扩散基线，在低采样预算下特别有效

Conclusion: LDDMs通过潜在通道提供更软信号并携带跨token依赖关系，有助于解决歧义，提升生成质量

Abstract: We study discrete diffusion for language and other categorical data and focus
on a common limitation of masked denoisers: reverse transitions typically
factorize across positions, which can weaken joint structure and degrade
quality in few-step generation. We propose \emph{Latent Discrete Diffusion
Models} (LDDMs), which couple a masked discrete diffusion over tokens with a
continuous diffusion over latent embeddings. The latent channel provides a
softer signal and carries cross-token dependencies that help resolve
ambiguities. We present two instantiations: (i) FUJI-LDDMs, which perform fully
joint denoising of tokens and latents, and (ii) SEQ-LDDMs, which sequentially
resolve the latent and then the discrete chain conditionally on it. For both
variants we derive ELBO-style objectives and discuss design choices to learn
informative latents yet amenable to diffusoin modeling. In experiments, LDDMs
yield improvements on unconditional generation metrics as compared to
state-of-the-art masked discrete diffusion baselines, and are effective at
lower sampling budgets, where unmasking many tokens per step is desirable.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 分析Rectified Flows中直线路径目标隐藏的基本失效模式，特别是在确定性训练下低梯度方差驱动的记忆化问题。

Method: 研究高斯到高斯的传输，通过损失梯度方差分析随机和确定性机制下优化的向量场偏好，并在CelebA数据集上进行实证验证。

Result: 确定性插值导致记忆化，在推理时重现训练配对；而注入小噪声可以恢复泛化能力。

Conclusion: Rectified Flows的直线路径目标在确定性训练下会收敛到记忆化向量场，需要通过噪声注入来避免过拟合并保持泛化性能。

Abstract: Rectified Flows learn ODE vector fields whose trajectories are straight
between source and target distributions, enabling near one-step inference. We
show that this straight-path objective conceals fundamental failure modes:
under deterministic training, low gradient variance drives memorization of
arbitrary training pairings, even when interpolant lines between pairs
intersect. To analyze this mechanism, we study Gaussian-to-Gaussian transport
and use the loss gradient variance across stochastic and deterministic regimes
to characterize which vector fields optimization favors in each setting. We
then show that, in a setting where all interpolating lines intersect, applying
Rectified Flow yields the same specific pairings at inference as during
training. More generally, we prove that a memorizing vector field exists even
when training interpolants intersect, and that optimizing the straight-path
objective converges to this ill-defined field. At inference, deterministic
integration reproduces the exact training pairings. We validate our findings
empirically on the CelebA dataset, confirming that deterministic interpolants
induce memorization, while the injection of small noise restores
generalization.

Motivation: 传统方法使用离散原子坐标或图结构表示分子，难以实现空间细粒度特征提取和条件生成任务。HyDiF旨在通过连续场表示克服这些限制。

Method: 使用分子方向场(MDF)将空间点映射到最近原子的方向，通过超网络生成分子特定的神经隐式场(MNF)，并训练为去噪扩散模型，支持掩码扩散机制。

Conclusion: HyDiF展示了基于场的分子建模的潜力，为分子表示和生成提供了连续、局部化的新方法。

Abstract: We introduce HyperDiffusionFields (HyDiF), a framework that models 3D
molecular conformers as continuous fields rather than discrete atomic
coordinates or graphs. At the core of our approach is the Molecular Directional
Field (MDF), a vector field that maps any point in space to the direction of
the nearest atom of a particular type. We represent MDFs using
molecule-specific neural implicit fields, which we call Molecular Neural Fields
(MNFs). To enable learning across molecules and facilitate generalization, we
adopt an approach where a shared hypernetwork, conditioned on a molecule,
generates the weights of the given molecule's MNF. To endow the model with
generative capabilities, we train the hypernetwork as a denoising diffusion
model, enabling sampling in the function space of molecular fields. Our design
naturally extends to a masked diffusion mechanism to support
structure-conditioned generation tasks, such as molecular inpainting, by
selectively noising regions of the field. Beyond generation, the localized and
continuous nature of MDFs enables spatially fine-grained feature extraction for
molecular property prediction, something not easily achievable with graph or
point cloud based methods. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our approach scales
to larger biomolecules, illustrating a promising direction for field-based
molecular modeling.

Abstract: Motivated by the recently shown connection between self-attention and
(kernel) principal component analysis (PCA), we revisit the fundamentals of
PCA. Using the difference-of-convex (DC) framework, we present several novel
formulations and provide new theoretical insights. In particular, we show the
kernelizability and out-of-sample applicability for a PCA-like family of
problems. Moreover, we uncover that simultaneous iteration, which is connected
to the classical QR algorithm, is an instance of the difference-of-convex
algorithm (DCA), offering an optimization perspective on this longstanding
method. Further, we describe new algorithms for PCA and empirically compare
them with state-of-the-art methods. Lastly, we introduce a kernelizable dual
formulation for a robust variant of PCA that minimizes the $l_1$ deviation of
the reconstruction errors.

Result: 理论证明该方法在双人零和博弈中保证严格单调改进并收敛到精确纳什均衡。在经典基准游戏和大型领域（如Battleship和No-Limit Texas Hold'em）中，NashPG达到可比或更低的可剥削性，并获得更高的Elo评分。

Conclusion: NashPG提供了一种稳定且可扩展的方法来寻找纳什均衡，在保持策略梯度方法通用性的同时，解决了传统正则化方法的不稳定性问题。

Abstract: Finding Nash equilibria in imperfect-information games remains a central
challenge in multi-agent reinforcement learning. While regularization-based
methods have recently achieved last-iteration convergence to a regularized
equilibrium, they require the regularization strength to shrink toward zero to
approximate a Nash equilibrium, often leading to unstable learning in practice.
Instead, we fix the regularization strength at a large value for robustness and
achieve convergence by iteratively refining the reference policy. Our main
theoretical result shows that this procedure guarantees strictly monotonic
improvement and convergence to an exact Nash equilibrium in two-player zero-sum
games, without requiring a uniqueness assumption. Building on this framework,
we develop a practical algorithm, Nash Policy Gradient (NashPG), which
preserves the generalizability of policy gradient methods while relying solely
on the current and reference policies. Empirically, NashPG achieves comparable
or lower exploitability than prior model-free methods on classic benchmark
games and scales to large domains such as Battleship and No-Limit Texas
Hold'em, where NashPG consistently attains higher Elo ratings.

Motivation: 解决LLM内部推理不透明且难以控制的问题，稀疏自编码器虽然能暴露潜在特征但缺乏系统推理机制。

Method: 三阶段框架：(1)识别潜在概念表示并组织成字典；(2)在推理时检测激活概念并映射为逻辑命题；(3)应用逻辑规则进行推理、组合新概念和引导模型行为。

Result: 在多个推理任务上表现稳健，能够扩展到复杂推理，泛化到抽象和上下文敏感任务，并在不同模型骨干间迁移。

Conclusion: 将逻辑结构嵌入潜在激活不仅能提高透明度，还能实现结构化推理、可靠控制和行为对齐，为更可靠和可审计的AI提供路径。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at generating fluent text, but their
internal reasoning remains opaque and difficult to control. Sparse autoencoders
(SAEs) make hidden activations more interpretable by exposing latent features
that often align with human concepts. Yet, these features are fragile and
passive, offering no mechanism for systematic reasoning or model control. To
address this, we introduce ActivationReasoning (AR), a framework that embeds
explicit logical reasoning into the latent space of LLMs. It proceeds in three
stages: (1) Finding latent representations, first latent concept
representations are identified (e.g., via SAEs) and organized into a
dictionary; (2) Activating propositions, at inference time AR detects
activating concepts and maps them to logical propositions; and (3)Logical
reasoning, applying logical rules over these propositions to infer higher-order
structures, compose new concepts, and steer model behavior. We evaluate AR on
multi-hop reasoning (PrOntoQA), abstraction and robustness to indirect concept
cues (Rail2Country), reasoning over natural and diverse language (ProverQA),
and context-sensitive safety (BeaverTails). Across all tasks, AR scales
robustly with reasoning complexity, generalizes to abstract and
context-sensitive tasks, and transfers across model backbones. These results
demonstrate that grounding logical structure in latent activations not only
improves transparency but also enables structured reasoning, reliable control,
and alignment with desired behaviors, providing a path toward more reliable and
auditable AI.

Abstract: The objective of designing a control system is to steer a dynamical system
with a control signal, guiding it to exhibit the desired behavior. The
Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) partial differential equation offers a framework
for optimal control system design. However, numerical solutions to this
equation are computationally intensive, and analytical solutions are frequently
unavailable. Knowledge-guided machine learning methodologies, such as
physics-informed neural networks (PINNs), offer new alternative approaches that
can alleviate the difficulties of solving the HJB equation numerically. This
work presents a multistage ensemble framework to learn the optimal cost-to-go,
and subsequently the corresponding optimal control signal, through the HJB
equation. Prior PINN-based approaches rely on a stabilizing the HJB enforcement
during training. Our framework does not use stabilizer terms and offers a means
of controlling the nonlinear system, via either a singular learned control
signal or an ensemble control signal policy. Success is demonstrated in
closed-loop control, using both ensemble- and singular-control, of a
steady-state time-invariant two-state continuous nonlinear system with an
infinite time horizon, accounting of noisy, perturbed system states and varying
initial conditions.

Abstract: This paper investigates underwater cooperative target detection using
autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs), with a focus on the critical trade-off
between cooperation efficiency and communication covertness. To tackle this
challenge, we first formulate a joint trajectory and power control optimization
problem, and then present an innovative hierarchical action management
framework to solve it. According to the hierarchical formulation, at the macro
level, the master AUV models the agent selection process as a Markov decision
process and deploys the proximal policy optimization algorithm for strategic
task allocation. At the micro level, each selected agent's decentralized
decision-making is modeled as a partially observable Markov decision process,
and a multi-agent proximal policy optimization algorithm is used to dynamically
adjust its trajectory and transmission power based on its local observations.
Under the centralized training and decentralized execution paradigm, our target
detection framework enables adaptive covert cooperation while satisfying both
energy and mobility constraints. By comprehensively modeling the considered
system, the involved signals and tasks, as well as energy consumption,
theoretical insights and practical solutions for the efficient and secure
operation of multiple AUVs are provided, offering significant implications for
the execution of underwater covert communication tasks.

Conclusion: P-GAP实现了快速、可扩展且资源高效的零阶LLM微调。

Abstract: Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) using zeroth-order (ZO) optimization
has emerged as a promising alternative to traditional gradient-based methods
due to its reduced memory footprint requirement. However, existing ZO methods
suffer from high variance in gradient estimation, leading to slow convergence
and suboptimal performance on large-scale models. In this work, we propose
P-GAP, a fast LLM fine-tuning approach through zeroth-order optimization with
Projected Gradient-Aligned Perturbations. Specifically, we first estimate a
low-dimensional gradient space and then align perturbations in projected
gradients' direction within the space. This approach enables reduced the number
of perturbed parameters and decreased variance, therefore accelerated

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了ACTG-ARL框架，通过分层分解和锚定强化学习，在差分隐私约束下生成高质量可控的合成文本，相比现有方法提升20% MAUVE指标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有差分隐私合成文本方法存在统计属性保留不足、效用损失严重、缺乏细粒度控制等问题，需要开发既能保护隐私又能保持文本质量和可控性的新方法。

Method: 采用分层框架：1）特征学习和条件文本生成两个子任务；2）ACTG方法使用丰富表格模式作为特征、DP表格合成器和DP微调条件生成器；3）ARL后训练方法结合强化学习和SFT锚点提升指令跟随能力。

Result: ACTG-ARL在强隐私保证下显著提升了DP合成文本质量（MAUVE指标提升20%）和条件生成器的控制能力。

Conclusion: ACTG-ARL框架成功解决了DP合成文本生成中的关键挑战，在隐私保护、文本质量和可控性方面都取得了显著进展。

Abstract: Generating high-quality synthetic text under differential privacy (DP) is
critical for training and evaluating language models without compromising user
privacy. Prior work on synthesizing DP datasets often fail to preserve key
statistical attributes, suffer utility loss from the noise required by DP, and
lack fine-grained control over generation. To address these challenges, we make
two contributions. First, we introduce a hierarchical framework that decomposes
DP synthetic text generation into two subtasks: feature learning and
conditional text generation. This design explicitly incorporates learned
features into the generation process and simplifies the end-to-end synthesis
task. Through systematic ablations, we identify the most effective
configuration: a rich tabular schema as feature, a DP tabular synthesizer, and
a DP fine-tuned conditional generator, which we term ACTG
(Attribute-Conditioned Text Generation). Second, we propose Anchored RL (ARL),
a post-training method that improves the instruction-following ability of ACTG
for conditional generation. ARL combines RL to boost control with an SFT anchor
on best-of-$N$ data to prevent reward hacking. Together, these components form
our end-to-end algorithm ACTG-ARL, which advances both the quality of DP
synthetic text (+20% MAUVE over prior work) and the control of the conditional
generator under strong privacy guarantees.

TL;DR: 论文指出当前AI/ML社会影响研究的评审标准过度强调同时实现部署和方法创新，这不利于更广泛的社会影响研究生态系统的可持续发展。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI/ML社会影响研究的评审标准存在偏差，过度强调同时实现部署和方法创新，这可能削弱更广泛社会影响研究生态系统的可持续性。

Method: 提出立场观点，建议研究人员和评审者应同时采纳：1）超越部署的更广泛社会影响概念；2）对已部署系统影响进行更严格的评估。

Result: 识别了当前评审标准的问题，并提出了改进方向，但未提供具体实证结果。

Conclusion: 需要重新定义AI/ML社会影响研究的评审标准，以支持更广泛的研究生态系统，包括那些仅在应用或方法单方面做出贡献的项目。

Abstract: There has been increasing research interest in AI/ML for social impact, and
correspondingly more publication venues have refined review criteria for
practice-driven AI/ML research. However, these review guidelines tend to most
concretely recognize projects that simultaneously achieve deployment and novel
ML methodological innovation. We argue that this introduces incentives for
researchers that undermine the sustainability of a broader research ecosystem
of social impact, which benefits from projects that make contributions on
single front (applied or methodological) that may better meet project partner
needs. Our position is that researchers and reviewers in machine learning for
social impact must simultaneously adopt: 1) a more expansive conception of
social impacts beyond deployment and 2) more rigorous evaluations of the impact
of deployed systems.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为RULE的鲁棒多模态实体对齐框架，用于解决多模态知识图谱中存在的双重噪声对应问题，包括实体-属性层和跨图谱层的噪声对应。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常假设实体内部和跨图谱对应关系都是完美的，但现实中的多模态知识图谱由于依赖专家标注，往往存在噪声对应问题。本文揭示并研究了双重噪声对应这一实际但未被充分探索的问题。

Method: RULE框架首先通过双重原则估计实体内部和跨图谱对应关系的可靠性，然后利用估计的可靠性在属性融合时减轻实体内部噪声的影响，在消除跨图谱差异时防止对噪声对应关系的过拟合。此外，还包含一个对应推理模块来发现跨图谱的潜在属性-属性连接。

Result: 在五个基准数据集上的广泛实验表明，与七种最先进方法相比，RULE在应对双重噪声对应问题上具有显著有效性。

Conclusion: RULE框架能够有效处理多模态实体对齐中的双重噪声对应问题，通过可靠性估计和对应推理提高了实体对齐的准确性。

Abstract: Multi-modal entity alignment (MMEA) aims to identify equivalent entities
across heterogeneous multi-modal knowledge graphs (MMKGs), where each entity is
described by attributes from various modalities. Existing methods typically
assume that both intra-entity and inter-graph correspondences are faultless,
which is often violated in real-world MMKGs due to the reliance on expert
annotations. In this paper, we reveal and study a highly practical yet
under-explored problem in MMEA, termed Dual-level Noisy Correspondence (DNC).
DNC refers to misalignments in both intra-entity (entity-attribute) and
inter-graph (entity-entity and attribute-attribute) correspondences. To address
the DNC problem, we propose a robust MMEA framework termed RULE. RULE first
estimates the reliability of both intra-entity and inter-graph correspondences
via a dedicated two-fold principle. Leveraging the estimated reliabilities,
RULE mitigates the negative impact of intra-entity noise during attribute
fusion and prevents overfitting to noisy inter-graph correspondences during
inter-graph discrepancy elimination. Beyond the training-time designs, RULE
further incorporates a correspondence reasoning module that uncovers the
underlying attribute-attribute connection across graphs, guaranteeing more
accurate equivalent entity identification. Extensive experiments on five
benchmarks verify the effectiveness of our method against the DNC compared with
seven state-of-the-art methods.The code is available at

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种条件缩放定律和搜索框架，用于在保持准确性的同时优化大语言模型的推理效率，通过调整隐藏大小、MLP与注意力参数分配比例等架构因素。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型参数规模和训练数据量的增长，推理成本已成为重要问题，但模型准确性与推理效率之间的权衡关系尚未充分探索。

Method: 引入条件缩放定律，在Chinchilla框架基础上加入架构信息，开发搜索框架识别同时具备推理效率和准确性的架构，训练了200多个从80M到3B参数的模型进行验证。

Result: 条件缩放定律能可靠预测最优架构选择，优化后的模型在相同训练预算下比LLaMA-3.2准确率提高2.1%，推理吞吐量提升42%。

Conclusion: 通过系统优化模型架构，可以在不牺牲准确性的前提下显著提升推理效率，为高效大语言模型设计提供了有效方法。

Abstract: Scaling the number of parameters and the size of training data has proven to
be an effective strategy for improving large language model (LLM) performance.
Yet, as these models grow increasingly powerful and widely deployed, the cost
of inference has become a pressing concern. Despite its importance, the
trade-off between model accuracy and inference efficiency remains
underexplored. In this work, we examine how key architectural factors, hidden
size, the allocation of parameters between MLP and attention (mlp-to-attention
ratio), and grouped-query attention (GQA), influence both inference cost and
accuracy. We introduce a conditional scaling law that augments the Chinchilla
framework with architectural information, along with a search framework for
identifying architectures that are simultaneously inference-efficient and
accurate. To validate our approach, we train more than 200 models spanning 80M
to 3B parameters and 8B to 100B training tokens, and fit the proposed
conditional scaling law. Our results show that the conditional scaling law
reliably predicts optimal architectural choices and that the resulting models
outperform existing open-source baselines. Under the same training budget,
optimized architectures achieve up to 2.1% higher accuracy and 42% greater
inference throughput compared to LLaMA-3.2.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多任务学习中任务不平衡是一个主要挑战，虽然平衡不同任务的收敛速度是有效方法，但在复杂MTL系统中准确表征多个任务的训练动态和收敛速度非常困难。

Method: 利用神经正切核理论分析MTL训练动态，引入扩展的NTK矩阵，采用谱分析平衡多个任务的收敛速度，并提出基于共享表示近似的NTKMTL-SR以提高训练效率。

Result: 在包括多任务监督学习和多任务强化学习的广泛基准测试中，该方法实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: NTKMTL方法通过理论分析和谱分析有效解决了多任务学习中的任务不平衡问题，在保持竞争力的同时提高了训练效率。

Abstract: Multi-Task Learning (MTL) enables a single model to learn multiple tasks
simultaneously, leveraging knowledge transfer among tasks for enhanced
generalization, and has been widely applied across various domains. However,
task imbalance remains a major challenge in MTL. Although balancing the
convergence speeds of different tasks is an effective approach to address this
issue, it is highly challenging to accurately characterize the training
dynamics and convergence speeds of multiple tasks within the complex MTL
system. To this end, we attempt to analyze the training dynamics in MTL by
leveraging Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) theory and propose a new MTL method,
NTKMTL. Specifically, we introduce an extended NTK matrix for MTL and adopt
spectral analysis to balance the convergence speeds of multiple tasks, thereby
mitigating task imbalance. Based on the approximation via shared
representation, we further propose NTKMTL-SR, achieving training efficiency
while maintaining competitive performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that our methods achieve state-of-the-art performance across a wide range of
benchmarks, including both multi-task supervised learning and multi-task
reinforcement learning. Source code is available at

TL;DR: 提出Customized-GRPO框架，通过Synergy-Aware Reward Shaping和Time-Aware Dynamic Weighting解决主题驱动图像生成中身份保持与提示遵循的竞争退化问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的在线强化学习（GRPO）方法在主题驱动图像生成中存在竞争退化问题，简单的线性奖励聚合会导致冲突的梯度信号，与扩散过程的时间动态不匹配。

Method: 提出Customized-GRPO框架，包含两个关键创新：1）Synergy-Aware Reward Shaping（SARS）- 非线性机制，惩罚冲突奖励信号并放大协同信号；2）Time-Aware Dynamic Weighting（TDW）- 动态权重调整，早期优先提示遵循，后期优先身份保持。

Result: 实验表明该方法显著优于朴素GRPO基线，成功缓解竞争退化，在保持关键身份特征的同时准确遵循复杂文本提示。

Conclusion: Customized-GRPO框架通过协同感知奖励塑造和时间感知动态加权，实现了身份保持与提示遵循的更好平衡，生成质量更高的图像。

Abstract: Subject-driven image generation models face a fundamental trade-off between
identity preservation (fidelity) and prompt adherence (editability). While
online reinforcement learning (RL), specifically GPRO, offers a promising
solution, we find that a naive application of GRPO leads to competitive
degradation, as the simple linear aggregation of rewards with static weights
causes conflicting gradient signals and a misalignment with the temporal
dynamics of the diffusion process. To overcome these limitations, we propose
Customized-GRPO, a novel framework featuring two key innovations: (i)
Synergy-Aware Reward Shaping (SARS), a non-linear mechanism that explicitly
penalizes conflicted reward signals and amplifies synergistic ones, providing a
sharper and more decisive gradient. (ii) Time-Aware Dynamic Weighting (TDW),
which aligns the optimization pressure with the model's temporal dynamics by
prioritizing prompt-following in the early, identity preservation in the later.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms
naive GRPO baselines, successfully mitigating competitive degradation. Our
model achieves a superior balance, generating images that both preserve key
identity features and accurately adhere to complex textual prompts.

Abstract: This paper is concerned with online time series forecasting, where unknown
distribution shifts occur over time, i.e., latent variables influence the
mapping from historical to future observations. To develop an automated way of
online time series forecasting, we propose a Theoretical framework for Online
Time-series forecasting (TOT in short) with theoretical guarantees.
Specifically, we prove that supplying a forecaster with latent variables
tightens the Bayes risk, the benefit endures under estimation uncertainty of
latent variables and grows as the latent variables achieve a more precise
identifiability. To better introduce latent variables into online forecasting
algorithms, we further propose to identify latent variables with minimal
adjacent observations. Based on these results, we devise a model-agnostic
blueprint by employing a temporal decoder to match the distribution of observed
variables and two independent noise estimators to model the causal inference of
latent variables and mixing procedures of observed variables, respectively.
Experiment results on synthetic data support our theoretical claims. Moreover,
plug-in implementations built on several baselines yield general improvement
across multiple benchmarks, highlighting the effectiveness in real-world
applications.

Motivation: 传统bandit算法在大波束空间下收敛慢，现有方法依赖奖励函数的单峰或多峰假设，但这些假设在实践中往往不成立，导致算法收敛到次优波束。

Method: pretc算法从随机探索阶段开始，然后在估计的奖励函数下选择最优波束；prgreedy算法在线估计并选择当前估计下的最佳波束。两种算法将每条路径参数视为黑盒，基于采样历史奖励维护最优估计。

Result: 在合成DeepMIMO数据集和真实DeepSense6G数据集上的实验表明，两种算法在各种场景和不同信道环境下都优于现有方法，显示出良好的泛化性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 基于稀疏多径特性的物理信息bandit算法能有效解决毫米波通信中的波束对准问题，无需依赖不现实的奖励函数结构假设，在实际应用中具有更好的性能。

Abstract: In millimeter wave (mmWave) communications, beam alignment and tracking are
crucial to combat the significant path loss. As scanning the entire directional
space is inefficient, designing an efficient and robust method to identify the
optimal beam directions is essential. Since traditional bandit algorithms
require a long time horizon to converge under large beam spaces, many existing
works propose efficient bandit algorithms for beam alignment by relying on
unimodality or multimodality assumptions on the reward function's structure.
However, such assumptions often do not hold (or cannot be strictly satisfied)
in practice, which causes such algorithms to converge to choosing suboptimal
beams.
  In this work, we propose two physics-informed bandit algorithms
\textit{pretc} and \textit{prgreedy} that exploit the sparse multipath property
of mmWave channels - a generic but realistic assumption - which is connected to
the Phase Retrieval Bandit problem. Our algorithms treat the parameters of each
path as black boxes and maintain optimal estimates of them based on sampled
historical rewards. \textit{pretc} starts with a random exploration phase and
then commits to the optimal beam under the estimated reward function.
\textit{prgreedy} performs such estimation in an online manner and chooses the
best beam under current estimates. Our algorithms can also be easily adapted to
beam tracking in the mobile setting. Through experiments using both the
synthetic DeepMIMO dataset and the real-world DeepSense6G dataset, we
demonstrate that both algorithms outperform existing approaches in a wide range
of scenarios across diverse channel environments, showing their
generalizability and robustness.

Motivation: 现有时间序列因果表示学习方法无法从单时间步观测变量中恢复分层潜在变量的联合分布，无法捕捉现实任务中多级抽象的时间依赖关系。

Method: 使用时间上下文观测变量识别多层潜在变量的联合分布，利用分层结构自然稀疏性识别每层潜在变量，开发基于变分推理的时间序列生成模型，包含上下文编码器和基于归一化流的分层先验网络。

Conclusion: CHiLD框架能够成功识别和建模分层潜在动态，为时间序列数据中的多级抽象时间依赖关系提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Modeling hierarchical latent dynamics behind time series data is critical for
capturing temporal dependencies across multiple levels of abstraction in
real-world tasks. However, existing temporal causal representation learning
methods fail to capture such dynamics, as they fail to recover the joint
distribution of hierarchical latent variables from \textit{single-timestep
observed variables}. Interestingly, we find that the joint distribution of
hierarchical latent variables can be uniquely determined using three
conditionally independent observations. Building on this insight, we propose a
Causally Hierarchical Latent Dynamic (CHiLD) identification framework. Our
approach first employs temporal contextual observed variables to identify the
joint distribution of multi-layer latent variables. Sequentially, we exploit
the natural sparsity of the hierarchical structure among latent variables to
identify latent variables within each layer. Guided by the theoretical results,
we develop a time series generative model grounded in variational inference.
This model incorporates a contextual encoder to reconstruct multi-layer latent
variables and normalize flow-based hierarchical prior networks to impose the
independent noise condition of hierarchical latent dynamics. Empirical
evaluations on both synthetic and real-world datasets validate our theoretical
claims and demonstrate the effectiveness of CHiLD in modeling hierarchical
latent dynamics.

Motivation: 探索Transformer模型在算法任务中是否以及如何构建结构化的内部世界模型，并研究模型规模对表示质量的影响。

Method: 使用强化学习训练Transformer执行冒泡排序式的相邻交换操作，通过系统改变嵌入维度来观察内部表示的变化。

Result: 高嵌入维度强化了结构化内部表示的形成，发现了两个一致机制：注意力权重矩阵最后一行单调编码全局排序，选择的交换操作与编码值的最大相邻差异对齐。

Conclusion: Transformer确实构建了结构化的内部世界模型，模型规模不仅提升最终性能，还改善了表示质量，为类似算法任务的分析提供了可用的指标和方法。

Abstract: We investigate how embedding dimension affects the emergence of an internal
"world model" in a transformer trained with reinforcement learning to perform
bubble-sort-style adjacent swaps. Models achieve high accuracy even with very
small embedding dimensions, but larger dimensions yield more faithful,
consistent, and robust internal representations. In particular, higher
embedding dimensions strengthen the formation of structured internal
representation and lead to better interpretability. After hundreds of
experiments, we observe two consistent mechanisms: (1) the last row of the
attention weight matrix monotonically encodes the global ordering of tokens;
and (2) the selected transposition aligns with the largest adjacent difference
of these encoded values. Our results provide quantitative evidence that
transformers build structured internal world models and that model size
improves representation quality in addition to end performance. We release our
metrics and analyses, which can be used to probe similar algorithmic tasks.

Conclusion: F-EDL通过更灵活的不确定性建模方法，显著提升了不确定性量化的泛化能力和可靠性，特别适用于复杂和挑战性场景。

Abstract: Uncertainty quantification (UQ) is crucial for deploying machine learning
models in high-stakes applications, where overconfident predictions can lead to
serious consequences. An effective UQ method must balance computational
efficiency with the ability to generalize across diverse scenarios. Evidential
deep learning (EDL) achieves efficiency by modeling uncertainty through the
prediction of a Dirichlet distribution over class probabilities. However, the
restrictive assumption of Dirichlet-distributed class probabilities limits
EDL's robustness, particularly in complex or unforeseen situations. To address
this, we propose \textit{flexible evidential deep learning}
($\mathcal{F}$-EDL), which extends EDL by predicting a flexible Dirichlet
distribution -- a generalization of the Dirichlet distribution -- over class
probabilities. This approach provides a more expressive and adaptive
representation of uncertainty, significantly enhancing UQ generalization and
reliability under challenging scenarios. We theoretically establish several
advantages of $\mathcal{F}$-EDL and empirically demonstrate its
state-of-the-art UQ performance across diverse evaluation settings, including
classical, long-tailed, and noisy in-distribution scenarios.

Abstract: We introduce Time-Conditioned Contraction Matching (TCCM), a novel method for
semi-supervised anomaly detection in tabular data. TCCM is inspired by flow
matching, a recent generative modeling framework that learns velocity fields
between probability distributions and has shown strong performance compared to
diffusion models and generative adversarial networks. Instead of directly
applying flow matching as originally formulated, TCCM builds on its core idea
-- learning velocity fields between distributions -- but simplifies the
framework by predicting a time-conditioned contraction vector toward a fixed
target (the origin) at each sampled time step. This design offers three key
advantages: (1) a lightweight and scalable training objective that removes the
need for solving ordinary differential equations during training and inference;
(2) an efficient scoring strategy called one time-step deviation, which
quantifies deviation from expected contraction behavior in a single forward
pass, addressing the inference bottleneck of existing continuous-time models
such as DTE (a diffusion-based model with leading anomaly detection accuracy
but heavy inference cost); and (3) explainability and provable robustness, as
the learned velocity field operates directly in input space, making the anomaly
score inherently feature-wise attributable; moreover, the score function is
Lipschitz-continuous with respect to the input, providing theoretical
guarantees under small perturbations. Extensive experiments on the ADBench
benchmark show that TCCM strikes a favorable balance between detection accuracy
and inference cost, outperforming state-of-the-art methods -- especially on
high-dimensional and large-scale datasets. The source code is available at our
GitHub repository.

Conclusion: 提出的瞬态访问测度概念和状态分类不变性为γ=1情况下的策略梯度方法建立了理论基础。

Abstract: The classical policy gradient method is the theoretical and conceptual
foundation of modern policy-based reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms. Most
rigorous analyses of such methods, particularly those establishing convergence
guarantees, assume a discount factor $\gamma < 1$. In contrast, however, a
recent line of work on policy-based RL for large language models uses the
undiscounted total-reward setting with $\gamma = 1$, rendering much of the
existing theory inapplicable. In this paper, we provide analyses of the policy
gradient method for undiscounted expected total-reward infinite-horizon MDPs
based on two key insights: (i) the classification of the MDP states into
recurrent and transient states is invariant over the set of policies that
assign strictly positive probability to every action (as is typical in deep RL
models employing a softmax output layer) and (ii) the classical state
visitation measure (which may be ill-defined when $\gamma = 1$) can be replaced
with a new object that we call the transient visitation measure.

Abstract: Understanding when learning is possible is a fundamental task in the theory
of machine learning. However, many characterizations known from the literature
deal with abstract learning as a mathematical object and ignore the crucial
question: when can learning be implemented as a computer program? We address
this question for universal online learning, a generalist theoretical model of
online binary classification, recently characterized by Bousquet et al.
(STOC'21). In this model, there is no hypothesis fixed in advance; instead,
Adversary -- playing the role of Nature -- can change their mind as long as
local consistency with the given class of hypotheses is maintained. We require
Learner to achieve a finite number of mistakes while using a strategy that can
be implemented as a computer program. We show that universal online learning
does not imply computable universal online learning, even if the class of
hypotheses is relatively easy from a computability-theoretic perspective. We
then study the agnostic variant of computable universal online learning and
provide an exact characterization of classes that are learnable in this sense.
We also consider a variant of proper universal online learning and show exactly
when it is possible. Together, our results give a more realistic perspective on
the existing theory of online binary classification and the related problem of
inductive inference.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了Hydra Ensembles，一种高效的基于Transformer的集成方法，通过剪枝注意力头创建多样化成员，并使用新的多头注意力与分组全连接层进行合并，在保持接近单网络推理速度的同时，达到或超越Deep Ensembles的不确定性量化性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度神经网络在安全关键场景中部署需要不确定性量化，但现有方法如Deep Ensembles计算和内存成本高，难以扩展到大型模型。

Method: 通过剪枝注意力头创建多样化集成成员，使用新的多头注意力机制与分组全连接层进行模型合并，形成紧凑的集成模型。

Result: 在图像和文本分类任务中，Hydra Ensembles在多种架构上持续优于Deep Ensembles，在ImageNet-1k零样本分类中甚至超越了现有最优方法，且无需额外训练。

Conclusion: Hydra Ensembles提供了一种高效的不确定性量化方法，在保持推理效率的同时实现了优异的性能，为大型模型部署提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Uncertainty quantification (UQ) is essential for deploying deep neural
networks in safety-critical settings. Although methods like Deep Ensembles
achieve strong UQ performance, their high computational and memory costs hinder
scalability to large models. We introduce Hydra Ensembles, an efficient
transformer-based ensemble that prunes attention heads to create diverse
members and merges them via a new multi-head attention with grouped
fully-connected layers. This yields a compact model with inference speed close
to a single network, matching or surpassing Deep Ensembles in UQ performance
without retraining from scratch. We also provide an in-depth analysis of
pruning, showing that naive approaches can harm calibration, whereas Hydra
Ensembles preserves robust uncertainty. Experiments on image and text
classification tasks, with various architectures, show consistent gains over
Deep Ensembles. Remarkably, in zero-shot classification on ImageNet-1k, our
approach surpasses state of the art methods, even without requiring additional
training.

Motivation: 现有基于信息流的神经网络架构编码器虽然性能优秀，但由于复杂结构导致处理速度慢，存在实际应用挑战

Method: 提出FGP预训练方法，训练编码器重构信息流代理（神经网络架构信息流的表示），无需专用模型结构

Result: FGP将编码器性能提升高达106%（Precision-1%指标），相比仅使用监督学习的相同编码器

Conclusion: FGP方法能有效捕获神经网络架构的信息流，显著提升编码器性能，同时避免了复杂模型结构带来的速度问题

Abstract: The performance of a deep learning model on a specific task and dataset
depends heavily on its neural architecture, motivating considerable efforts to
rapidly and accurately identify architectures suited to the target task and
dataset. To achieve this, researchers use machine learning models-typically
neural architecture encoders-to predict the performance of a neural
architecture. Many state-of-the-art encoders aim to capture information flow
within a neural architecture, which reflects how information moves through the
forward pass and backpropagation, via a specialized model structure. However,
due to their complicated structures, these flow-based encoders are
significantly slower to process neural architectures compared to simpler
encoders, presenting a notable practical challenge. To address this, we propose
FGP, a novel pre-training method for neural architecture encoding that trains
an encoder to capture the information flow without requiring specialized model
structures. FGP trains an encoder to reconstruct a flow surrogate, our proposed
representation of the neural architecture's information flow. Our experiments
show that FGP boosts encoder performance by up to 106% in Precision-1%,
compared to the same encoder trained solely with supervised learning.

TL;DR: 提出GraphRTA框架解决无监督开放集图域自适应问题，通过图重编程和模型重编程来识别已知类和未知类节点，无需手动设置阈值。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图域自适应模型主要关注闭集设置，但现实场景中目标域可能包含源域中不存在的未知类别，需要开发能够识别未知类的开放集方法。

Method: GraphRTA框架包含图重编程（修改目标图结构和节点特征）和模型重编程（剪枝域特定参数），并扩展分类器增加未知类维度。

Result: 在多个公共数据集上的综合实验表明，所提模型相比现有最先进基线方法取得了满意的性能。

Conclusion: GraphRTA能够有效解决无监督开放集图域自适应问题，既能正确分类已知类节点，又能识别未知类节点。

Abstract: Unsupervised Graph Domain Adaptation has become a promising paradigm for
transferring knowledge from a fully labeled source graph to an unlabeled target
graph. Existing graph domain adaptation models primarily focus on the
closed-set setting, where the source and target domains share the same label
spaces. However, this assumption might not be practical in the real-world
scenarios, as the target domain might include classes that are not present in
the source domain. In this paper, we investigate the problem of unsupervised
open-set graph domain adaptation, where the goal is to not only correctly
classify target nodes into the known classes, but also recognize previously
unseen node types into the unknown class. Towards this end, we propose a novel
framework called GraphRTA, which conducts reprogramming on both the graph and
model sides. Specifically, we reprogram the graph by modifying target graph
structure and node features, which facilitates better separation of known and
unknown classes. Meanwhile, we also perform model reprogramming by pruning
domain-specific parameters to reduce bias towards the source graph while
preserving parameters that capture transferable patterns across graphs.
Additionally, we extend the classifier with an extra dimension for the unknown
class, thus eliminating the need of manually specified threshold in open-set
recognition. Comprehensive experiments on several public datasets demonstrate
that our proposed model can achieve satisfied performance compared with recent
state-of-the-art baselines. Our source codes and datasets are publicly
available at https://github.com/cszhangzhen/GraphRTA.

Conclusion: 研究结果为专家训练和图数据上有效MoE框架的设计提供了可操作的指导。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have become essential tools for learning on
relational data, yet the performance of a single GNN is often limited by the
heterogeneity present in real-world graphs. Recent advances in
Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) frameworks demonstrate that assembling multiple,
explicitly diverse GNNs with distinct generalization patterns can significantly
improve performance. In this work, we present the first systematic empirical
study of expert-level diversification techniques for GNN ensembles. Evaluating
20 diversification strategies -- including random re-initialization,
hyperparameter tuning, architectural variation, directionality modeling, and
training data partitioning -- across 14 node classification benchmarks, we
construct and analyze over 200 ensemble variants. Our comprehensive evaluation
examines each technique in terms of expert diversity, complementarity, and
ensemble performance. We also uncovers mechanistic insights into training
maximally diverse experts. These findings provide actionable guidance for
expert training and the design of effective MoE frameworks on graph data. Our

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种针对NTMP（N元组包含M个正例）弱监督学习的新方法，通过元组计数构建可训练的无偏风险估计器，在仅知道每个元组中正例数量的情况下实现有效学习。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 弱监督学习通常使用聚合信号而非实例标签，NTMP监督场景在图像分类和多重实例测量中普遍存在，需要解决仅知道元组中正例数量时的学习问题。

Method: 通过将元组生成过程与潜在实例边际联系起来，推导出闭式无偏风险估计器，扩展到可变元组大小和计数，并引入ReLU校正来提高有限样本稳定性。

Result: 在转换为NTMP任务的基准测试中，该方法持续优于代表性弱监督基线，在类别先验不平衡和不同元组配置下保持稳健性。

Conclusion: 仅通过计数监督可以通过理论严谨且实际稳定的目标有效利用，为弱监督学习提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Weakly supervised learning often operates with coarse aggregate signals
rather than instance labels. We study a setting where each training example is
an $n$-tuple containing exactly m positives, while only the count m per tuple
is observed. This NTMP (N-tuple with M positives) supervision arises in, e.g.,
image classification with region proposals and multi-instance measurements. We
show that tuple counts admit a trainable unbiased risk estimator (URE) by
linking the tuple-generation process to latent instance marginals. Starting
from fixed (n,m), we derive a closed-form URE and extend it to variable tuple
sizes, variable counts, and their combination. Identification holds whenever
the effective mixing rate is separated from the class prior. We establish
generalization bounds via Rademacher complexity and prove statistical
consistency with standard rates under mild regularity assumptions. To improve
finite-sample stability, we introduce simple ReLU corrections to the URE that
preserve asymptotic correctness. Across benchmarks converted to NTMP tasks, the
approach consistently outperforms representative weak-supervision baselines and
yields favorable precision-recall and F1 trade-offs. It remains robust under
class-prior imbalance and across diverse tuple configurations, demonstrating
that count-only supervision can be exploited effectively through a
theoretically grounded and practically stable objective.

Result: 在MNIST上测试准确率99.52%（泛化差距0.48%），CIFAR-10上90.63%（泛化差距7.14%），比标准dropout和自适应梯度正则化方法提升1-2%。

Conclusion: MAGDrop通过结合理论洞察和实践进展，为增强深度神经网络泛化能力提供了稳健框架，适用于高风险应用。

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) achieve remarkable performance but often suffer
from overfitting due to their high capacity. We introduce Momentum-Adaptive
Gradient Dropout (MAGDrop), a novel regularization method that dynamically
adjusts dropout rates on activations based on current gradients and accumulated
momentum, enhancing stability in non-convex optimization landscapes. To
theoretically justify MAGDrop's effectiveness, we derive a tightened PAC-Bayes
generalization bound that accounts for its adaptive nature, achieving up to 20%
sharper bounds compared to standard approaches by leveraging momentum-driven
perturbation control. Empirically, the activation-based MAGDrop outperforms
baseline regularization techniques, including standard dropout and adaptive
gradient regularization, by 1-2% in test accuracy on MNIST (99.52%) and
CIFAR-10 (90.63%), with generalization gaps of 0.48% and 7.14%, respectively.
Our work bridges theoretical insights and practical advancements, offering a
robust framework for enhancing DNN generalization suitable for high-stakes
applications.

Motivation: 解决高维多模态概率分布采样中的模式崩溃和质量传输问题，特别是针对物理系统的玻尔兹曼分布采样。

Method: 引入约束质量传输(CMT)框架，在生成中间分布时约束连续步骤间的KL散度和熵衰减，增强分布重叠并缓解质量传输问题。

Result: 在标准基准测试和新引入的ELIL四肽系统中，CMT始终优于最先进的变分方法，有效样本量提高2.5倍以上且避免模式崩溃。

Conclusion: CMT框架通过约束KL散度和熵衰减，显著提高了玻尔兹曼生成器的采样效率和稳定性，为高维多模态分布采样提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Efficient sampling from high-dimensional and multimodal unnormalized
probability distributions is a central challenge in many areas of science and
machine learning. We focus on Boltzmann generators (BGs) that aim to sample the
Boltzmann distribution of physical systems, such as molecules, at a given
temperature. Classical variational approaches that minimize the reverse
Kullback-Leibler divergence are prone to mode collapse, while annealing-based
methods, commonly using geometric schedules, can suffer from mass teleportation
and rely heavily on schedule tuning. We introduce Constrained Mass Transport
(CMT), a variational framework that generates intermediate distributions under
constraints on both the KL divergence and the entropy decay between successive
steps. These constraints enhance distributional overlap, mitigate mass
teleportation, and counteract premature convergence. Across standard BG
benchmarks and the here introduced ELIL tetrapeptide, the largest system
studied to date without access to samples from molecular dynamics, CMT
consistently surpasses state-of-the-art variational methods, achieving more
than 2.5x higher effective sample size while avoiding mode collapse.

Result: 实验表明SE-HTGNN比最新基线方法快10倍，同时保持最佳预测精度。

Conclusion: SE-HTGNN提供了一种简单高效的异构时序图学习范式，显著提升了模型效率和性能。

Abstract: Heterogeneous temporal graphs (HTGs) are ubiquitous data structures in the
real world. Recently, to enhance representation learning on HTGs, numerous
attention-based neural networks have been proposed. Despite these successes,
existing methods rely on a decoupled temporal and spatial learning paradigm,
which weakens interactions of spatio-temporal information and leads to a high
model complexity. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel learning paradigm for
HTGs called Simple and Efficient Heterogeneous Temporal Graph N}eural Network
(SE-HTGNN). Specifically, we innovatively integrate temporal modeling into
spatial learning via a novel dynamic attention mechanism, which retains
attention information from historical graph snapshots to guide subsequent
attention computation, thereby improving the overall discriminative
representations learning of HTGs. Additionally, to comprehensively and
adaptively understand HTGs, we leverage large language models to prompt
SE-HTGNN, enabling the model to capture the implicit properties of node types
as prior knowledge. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SE-HTGNN achieves up
to 10x speed-up over the state-of-the-art and latest baseline while maintaining
the best forecasting accuracy.

Result: 发现知识图谱显示出与现有数据集不同的趋势：在公平感知GNN中准确性与公平性指标之间的权衡更清晰；性能不仅受公平感知GNN方法影响，还受GNN骨干网络和早停条件影响；预处理方法通常改善公平性指标，而过程中处理方法提高预测准确性。

Conclusion: 知识图谱上的公平感知GNN研究揭示了独特的性能特征，强调了考虑GNN架构和训练策略对公平性影响的重要性，为知识图谱应用中的公平性优化提供了指导。

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) are powerful tools for learning from
graph-structured data but often produce biased predictions with respect to
sensitive attributes. Fairness-aware GNNs have been actively studied for
mitigating biased predictions. However, no prior studies have evaluated
fairness-aware GNNs on knowledge graphs, which are one of the most important
graphs in many applications, such as recommender systems. Therefore, we
introduce a benchmarking study on knowledge graphs. We generate new graphs from
three knowledge graphs, YAGO, DBpedia, and Wikidata, that are significantly
larger than the existing graph datasets used in fairness studies. We benchmark
inprocessing and preprocessing methods in different GNN backbones and early
stopping conditions. We find several key insights: (i) knowledge graphs show
different trends from existing datasets; clearer trade-offs between prediction
accuracy and fairness metrics than other graphs in fairness-aware GNNs, (ii)
the performance is largely affected by not only fairness-aware GNN methods but
also GNN backbones and early stopping conditions, and (iii) preprocessing
methods often improve fairness metrics, while inprocessing methods improve
prediction accuracy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法难以平衡强化学习的安全性和性能：严格的安全约束会降低任务性能，而优先奖励的方法则频繁违反安全约束，导致成本景观扩散、梯度平坦化，阻碍策略改进。

Method: USC方法在评论家训练中集成不确定性感知调制和细化，在不确定和高成本区域集中保守性，同时在安全区域保持锐利梯度。

Result: 实验表明USC将安全违规减少约40%，同时保持竞争性或更高的奖励，预测与真实成本梯度之间的误差减少约83%。

Conclusion: USC打破了安全与性能之间的传统权衡，为可扩展的安全强化学习铺平了道路。

Abstract: Ensuring the safe exploration of reinforcement learning (RL) agents is
critical for deployment in real-world systems. Yet existing approaches struggle
to strike the right balance: methods that tightly enforce safety often cripple
task performance, while those that prioritize reward leave safety constraints
frequently violated, producing diffuse cost landscapes that flatten gradients
and stall policy improvement. We introduce the Uncertain Safety Critic (USC), a
novel approach that integrates uncertainty-aware modulation and refinement into
critic training. By concentrating conservatism in uncertain and costly regions
while preserving sharp gradients in safe areas, USC enables policies to achieve
effective reward-safety trade-offs. Extensive experiments show that USC reduces
safety violations by approximately 40% while maintaining competitive or higher
rewards, and reduces the error between predicted and true cost gradients by
approximately 83%, breaking the prevailing trade-off between safety and
performance and paving the way for scalable safe RL.

Motivation: 在安全关键环境中，现有方法假设完美的危险检测能力，而不确定性感知方法缺乏有限样本保证，需要既准确感知危险又具备严格不确定性处理的方法。

Method: 将分布无关的有限样本安全保证集成到语义分割中，生成带有严格漏检界限的校准危险地图，这些地图为下游RL规划提供风险感知成本场。

Result: 在两个卫星基准测试中，COPPOL相比基线方法将危险覆盖率提高了6倍，几乎完全检测不安全区域，同时将导航中的危险违规减少了约50%。

Conclusion: 该方法对分布偏移保持鲁棒性，同时保持了安全性和效率，为安全关键导航提供了可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Reliable navigation in safety-critical environments requires both accurate
hazard perception and principled uncertainty handling to strengthen downstream
safety handling. Despite the effectiveness of existing approaches, they assume
perfect hazard detection capabilities, while uncertainty-aware perception
approaches lack finite-sample guarantees. We present COPPOL, a conformal-driven
perception-to-policy learning approach that integrates distribution-free,
finite-sample safety guarantees into semantic segmentation, yielding calibrated
hazard maps with rigorous bounds for missed detections. These maps induce
risk-aware cost fields for downstream RL planning. Across two satellite-derived
benchmarks, COPPOL increases hazard coverage (up to 6x) compared to comparative
baselines, achieving near-complete detection of unsafe regions while reducing
hazardous violations during navigation (up to approx 50%). More importantly,
our approach remains robust to distributional shift, preserving both safety and
efficiency.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统ROC分析无法捕捉医院患者监测警报系统等应用中的关键因素，如避免误报疲劳的最小精度约束、医院人员能力限制的预测阳性数量上限，以及假阳性和假阴性的不对称成本。

Method: 1) 在ROC空间中表示满足精度和容量约束的分类器子集作为可行区域；2) 建立该可行区域的几何结构；3) 定义仅考虑ROC空间可行部分的性能指标——部分较差分类器面积；4) 在期望成本参数范围内平均该面积得到部分VOROS。

Result: 在MIMIC-IV数据集上使用生命体征历史预测死亡风险的实验中，证明这种成本感知指标在医院警报应用中比替代方法更适合对分类器进行排序。

Conclusion: 该方法成功解决了传统ROC分析的三个主要限制，为具有部署约束的实际应用提供了更合适的性能评估框架。

Abstract: The ROC curve is widely used to assess binary classification performance. Yet
for some applications such as alert systems for hospitalized patient
monitoring, conventional ROC analysis cannot capture crucial factors that
impact deployment, such as enforcing a minimum precision constraint to avoid
false alarm fatigue or imposing an upper bound on the number of predicted
positives to represent the capacity of hospital staff. The usual area under the
curve metric also does not reflect asymmetric costs for false positives and
false negatives. In this paper we address all three of these issues. First, we
show how the subset of classifiers that meet given precision and capacity
constraints can be represented as a feasible region in ROC space. We establish
the geometry of this feasible region. We then define the partial area of lesser
classifiers, a performance metric that is monotonic with cost and only accounts
for the feasible portion of ROC space. Averaging this area over a desired range
of cost parameters results in the partial volume over the ROC surface, or
partial VOROS. In experiments predicting mortality risk using vital sign
history on the MIMIC-IV dataset, we show this cost-aware metric is better than
alternatives for ranking classifiers in hospital alert applications.

Conclusion: 知识蒸馏存在被后门攻击转移的安全风险，低估了这种风险，T-MTB技术能够有效构建可转移的后门。

Abstract: LLMs are often used by downstream users as teacher models for knowledge
distillation, compressing their capabilities into memory-efficient models.
However, as these teacher models may stem from untrusted parties, distillation
can raise unexpected security risks. In this paper, we investigate the security
implications of knowledge distillation from backdoored teacher models. First,
we show that prior backdoors mostly do not transfer onto student models. Our
key insight is that this is because existing LLM backdooring methods choose
trigger tokens that rarely occur in usual contexts. We argue that this
underestimates the security risks of knowledge distillation and introduce a new
backdooring technique, T-MTB, that enables the construction and study of
transferable backdoors. T-MTB carefully constructs a composite backdoor
trigger, made up of several specific tokens that often occur individually in
anticipated distillation datasets. As such, the poisoned teacher remains
stealthy, while during distillation the individual presence of these tokens
provides enough signal for the backdoor to transfer onto the student. Using
T-MTB, we demonstrate and extensively study the security risks of transferable
backdoors across two attack scenarios, jailbreaking and content modulation, and
across four model families of LLMs.

*Loc Phuc Truong Nguyen,Hung Thanh Do*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RAISE框架通过可解释性、公平性、鲁棒性和可持续性四个维度评估AI模型，并给出综合责任分数。研究发现不同模型在不同维度表现各异，没有单一模型在所有责任标准上占优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI系统进入高风险领域，评估需要超越预测准确性，扩展到可解释性、公平性、鲁棒性和可持续性等多维度评估。

Method: 提出RAISE统一框架，量化模型在四个维度的表现并聚合成综合责任分数。评估了MLP、Tabular ResNet和特征标记化Transformer三种深度学习模型在金融、医疗和社会经济结构化数据集上的表现。

Result: MLP在可持续性和鲁棒性方面表现强劲；Transformer在可解释性和公平性方面表现出色但环境成本极高；Tabular ResNet提供了平衡的性能特征。

Conclusion: 没有单一模型在所有责任标准上占主导地位，强调多维度评估对于负责任模型选择的必要性。

Abstract: As AI systems enter high-stakes domains, evaluation must extend beyond
predictive accuracy to include explainability, fairness, robustness, and
sustainability. We introduce RAISE (Responsible AI Scoring and Evaluation), a
unified framework that quantifies model performance across these four
dimensions and aggregates them into a single, holistic Responsibility Score. We
evaluated three deep learning models: a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), a Tabular
ResNet, and a Feature Tokenizer Transformer, on structured datasets from
finance, healthcare, and socioeconomics. Our findings reveal critical
trade-offs: the MLP demonstrated strong sustainability and robustness, the
Transformer excelled in explainability and fairness at a very high
environmental cost, and the Tabular ResNet offered a balanced profile. These
results underscore that no single model dominates across all responsibility
criteria, highlighting the necessity of multi-dimensional evaluation for
responsible model selection. Our implementation is available at:

TL;DR: 提出了HeFS框架，通过遗传算法和多目标优化来改进现有特征选择算法的结果，识别被忽视但信息丰富的特征，在多个基准数据集上表现优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统特征选择方法容易过早收敛，难以捕捉复杂的高维特征关系，特别是在高维数据集中。

Conclusion: HeFS框架能有效改进现有特征选择算法的结果，识别互补特征，提升分类性能。

Abstract: Feature selection is a combinatorial optimization problem that is NP-hard.
Conventional approaches often employ heuristic or greedy strategies, which are
prone to premature convergence and may fail to capture subtle yet informative
features. This limitation becomes especially critical in high-dimensional
datasets, where complex and interdependent feature relationships prevail. We
introduce the HeFS (Helper-Enhanced Feature Selection) framework to refine
feature subsets produced by existing algorithms. HeFS systematically searches
the residual feature space to identify a Helper Set - features that complement
the original subset and improve classification performance. The approach
employs a biased initialization scheme and a ratio-guided mutation mechanism
within a genetic algorithm, coupled with Pareto-based multi-objective
optimization to jointly maximize predictive accuracy and feature
complementarity. Experiments on 18 benchmark datasets demonstrate that HeFS
consistently identifies overlooked yet informative features and achieves
superior performance over state-of-the-art methods, including in challenging
domains such as gastric cancer classification, drug toxicity prediction, and
computer science applications. The code and datasets are available at

Motivation: 图神经网络在对抗攻击检测方面面临挑战，现有技术通常依赖于强大的约束求解器（如混合整数规划），但效率较低。

Result: 在多种GNN变体和数据集上评估了RobLight工具，显示出比现有技术更好的性能。

Conclusion: 通过使用高效的部分求解器，可以在图神经网络的结构鲁棒性方面超越现有技术水平。

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) are the predominant architecture for learning
over graphs. As with any machine learning model, and important issue is the
detection of adversarial attacks, where an adversary can change the output with
a small perturbation of the input. Techniques for solving the adversarial
robustness problem - determining whether such an attack exists - were
originally developed for image classification, but there are variants for many
other machine learning architectures. In the case of graph learning, the attack
model usually considers changes to the graph structure in addition to or
instead of the numerical features of the input, and the state of the art
techniques in the area proceed via reduction to constraint solving, working on
top of powerful solvers, e.g. for mixed integer programming. We show that it is
possible to improve on the state of the art in structural robustness by
replacing the use of powerful solvers by calls to efficient partial solvers,
which run in polynomial time but may be incomplete. We evaluate our tool
RobLight on a diverse set of GNN variants and datasets.

TL;DR: 提出Unrolled-SINDy方法，通过解耦数值时间步长与数据采样率，解决稀疏时间采样数据下的PDE发现稳定性问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有SINDy方法在处理时间稀疏采样数据时存在局限性，由于局部截断误差大而无法恢复正确的方程参数

Method: 采用展开方案，通过迭代闭式方法或梯度下降方案，将数值时间步长与数据采样率解耦

Result: 在传统SINDy和先进的噪声鲁棒iNeuralSINDy上，使用不同数值方案（Euler、RK4）均能解决非展开方法无法处理的问题

Conclusion: Unrolled-SINDy方法具有通用性，能够显著提高PDE发现的稳定性，特别是在稀疏时间采样数据场景下

Abstract: Identifying from observation data the governing differential equations of a
physical dynamics is a key challenge in machine learning. Although approaches
based on SINDy have shown great promise in this area, they still fail to
address a whole class of real world problems where the data is sparsely sampled
in time. In this article, we introduce Unrolled-SINDy, a simple methodology
that leverages an unrolling scheme to improve the stability of explicit methods
for PDE discovery. By decorrelating the numerical time step size from the
sampling rate of the available data, our approach enables the recovery of
equation parameters that would not be the minimizers of the original SINDy
optimization problem due to large local truncation errors. Our method can be
exploited either through an iterative closed-form approach or by a gradient
descent scheme. Experiments show the versatility of our method. On both
traditional SINDy and state-of-the-art noise-robust iNeuralSINDy, with
different numerical schemes (Euler, RK4), our proposed unrolling scheme allows
to tackle problems not accessible to non-unrolled methods.

TL;DR: 该论文研究了在下一个符号预测（NSP）设置下的语言可学习性，其中学习者接收正例以及每个前缀的额外信息。虽然NSP提供了比传统分类更丰富的标签，但学习DFA和布尔公式等概念类仍然是计算困难的。

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究NSP设置下的可学习性，因为该设置已被用于实证分析神经序列模型，且高效的NSP算法可用于学习语言模型的（截断）支持。

Method: 通过构造使几乎所有额外标签变得无信息，将传统学习问题归约到带NSP标签的学习问题。

Result: 在密码学假设下，学习DFA在NSP设置下是计算困难的。

Conclusion: 尽管NSP设置提供了更丰富的标签信息，但学习某些概念类（如DFA和布尔公式）的计算困难性仍然存在。

Abstract: We study the learnability of languages in the Next Symbol Prediction (NSP)
setting, where a learner receives only positive examples from a language
together with, for every prefix, (i) whether the prefix itself is in the
language and (ii) which next symbols can lead to an accepting string. This
setting has been used in prior works to empirically analyze neural sequence
models, and additionally, we observe that efficient algorithms for the NSP
setting can be used to learn the (truncated) support of language models. We
formalize the setting so as to make it amenable to PAC-learning analysis. While
the setting provides a much richer set of labels than the conventional
classification setting, we show that learning concept classes such as DFAs and
Boolean formulas remains computationally hard. The proof is via a construction
that makes almost all additional labels uninformative, yielding a reduction
from the conventional learning problem to learning with NSP labels. Under
cryptographic assumptions, the reduction implies that the problem of learning
DFAs is computationally hard in the NSP setting.

Motivation: 现有理论研究主要关注线性回归任务和独立同分布输入，为了理解Transformer在建模动态驱动函数时的上下文学习机制，需要研究马尔可夫函数学习。

Method: 通过结构化上下文学习设置，分析损失景观以揭示底层优化行为，包括推导单层线性自注意力模型的全局最优解闭式表达式，证明参数恢复的NP难性，以及解释多层模型作为预条件梯度下降。

Result: 获得了单层线性自注意力模型在扩展参数空间中的全局最优解闭式表达式，证明了恢复最优参数是NP难问题，提出了多层模型优化多个目标的新解释。

Conclusion: 单层线性自注意力在表示结构化动态函数方面存在根本限制，而多层模型能够通过预条件梯度下降优化更广泛的目标，这些理论结果通过简化Transformer得到了数值验证。

Abstract: Transformer architectures can solve unseen tasks based on input-output pairs
in a given prompt due to in-context learning (ICL). Existing theoretical
studies on ICL have mainly focused on linear regression tasks, often with
i.i.d. inputs. To understand how transformers express ICL when modeling
dynamics-driven functions, we investigate Markovian function learning through a
structured ICL setup, where we characterize the loss landscape to reveal
underlying optimization behaviors. Specifically, we (1) provide the closed-form
expression of the global minimizer (in an enlarged parameter space) for a
single-layer linear self-attention (LSA) model; (2) prove that recovering
transformer parameters that realize the optimal solution is NP-hard in general,
revealing a fundamental limitation of one-layer LSA in representing structured
dynamical functions; and (3) supply a novel interpretation of a multilayer LSA
as performing preconditioned gradient descent to optimize multiple objectives
beyond the square loss. These theoretical results are numerically validated
using simplified transformers.

Conclusion: 该方法为行业、政策制定者和农民在气候变化背景下构建更具韧性的农业提供了决策支持，成功结合了物理模型的可解释性和机器学习模型的预测能力。

Abstract: Water is essential for agricultural productivity. Assessing water shortages
and reduced yield potential is a critical factor in decision-making for
ensuring agricultural productivity and food security. Crop simulation models,
which align with physical processes, offer intrinsic explainability but often
perform poorly. Conversely, machine learning models for crop yield modeling are
powerful and scalable, yet they commonly operate as black boxes and lack
adherence to the physical principles of crop growth. This study bridges this
gap by coupling the advantages of both worlds. We postulate that the crop yield
is inherently defined by the water availability. Therefore, we formulate crop
yield as a function of temporal water scarcity and predict both the crop
drought stress and the sensitivity to water scarcity at fine-scale resolution.
Sequentially modeling the crop yield response to water enables accurate yield
prediction. To enforce physical consistency, a novel physics-informed loss
function is proposed. We leverage multispectral satellite imagery,
meteorological data, and fine-scale yield data. Further, to account for the
uncertainty within the model, we build upon a deep ensemble approach. Our
method surpasses state-of-the-art models like LSTM and Transformers in crop
yield prediction with a coefficient of determination ($R^2$-score) of up to
0.82 while offering high explainability. This method offers decision support
for industry, policymakers, and farmers in building a more resilient
agriculture in times of changing climate conditions.

Motivation: 现有对话动态模型通常无法泛化到单一群体之外，且试图用通用公式描述发言行为可能不适合所有群体。

Method: 开发了先前对话模型的泛化版本，基于个体特征（人格特质）和先前发言行为预测任何群体中个体的发言轮次，特别能够学习发言倾向如何随上次发言时间而变化。

Result: 在合成和真实对话数据上验证了该方法，结果表明先前行为模型可能不总是现实的。

Conclusion: 提出了数据驱动但理论基础扎实的方法，能够更好地表征真实的群体互动。

Abstract: We propose a flexible probabilistic model for predicting turn-taking patterns
in group conversations based solely on individual characteristics and past
speaking behavior. Many models of conversation dynamics cannot yield insights
that generalize beyond a single group. Moreover, past works often aim to
characterize speaking behavior through a universal formulation that may not be
suitable for all groups. We thus develop a generalization of prior conversation
models that predicts speaking turns among individuals in any group based on
their individual characteristics, that is, personality traits, and prior
speaking behavior. Importantly, our approach provides the novel ability to
learn how speaking inclination varies based on when individuals last spoke. We
apply our model to synthetic and real-world conversation data to verify the
proposed approach and characterize real group interactions. Our results
demonstrate that previous behavioral models may not always be realistic,
motivating our data-driven yet theoretically grounded approach.

Abstract: The vast majority of cardiovascular diseases may be preventable if early
signs and risk factors are detected. Cardiovascular monitoring with body-worn
sensor devices like sensor patches allows for the detection of such signs while
preserving the freedom and comfort of patients. However, the analysis of the
sensor data must be robust, reliable, efficient, and highly accurate. Deep
learning methods can automate data interpretation, reducing the workload of
clinicians. In this work, we analyze the feasibility of applying deep learning
models to the classification of synchronized electrocardiogram (ECG) and
phonocardiogram (PCG) recordings on resource-constrained medical edge devices.
We propose a convolutional neural network with early fusion of data to solve a
binary classification problem. We train and validate our model on the
synchronized ECG and PCG recordings from the Physionet Challenge 2016 dataset.
Our approach reduces memory footprint and compute cost by three orders of
magnitude compared to the state-of-the-art while maintaining competitive
accuracy. We demonstrate the applicability of our proposed model on medical
edge devices by analyzing energy consumption on a microcontroller and an
experimental sensor device setup, confirming that on-device inference can be
more energy-efficient than continuous data streaming.

Abstract: The reasoning large language model (RLLM) has been proven competitive in
solving complex reasoning tasks such as mathematics, coding, compared to
general LLM. However, the serving performance and behavior of RLLM remains
unexplored, which may undermine the deployment and utilization of RLLM in
real-world scenario. To close this gap, in this paper, we conduct a
comprehensive study of RLLM service. We first perform a pilot study on
comparing the serving performance between RLLM and traditional LLM and reveal
that there are several distinct differences regarding serving behavior: (1)
significant memory usage and fluctuations; (2) straggler requests; (3) adaptive
running time; (4) domain preference. Then we further investigate whether
existing inference optimization techniques are valid for RLLM. Our main
takeaways are that model quantization methods and speculative decoding can
improve service system efficiency with small compromise to RLLM accuracy, while
prefix caching, KV cache quantization may even degrade accuracy or serving
performance for small RLLM. Lastly, we conduct evaluation under real world
workload modeled by Gamma distribution to verify our findings. Empirical
results of real world workload evaluation across different dataset are aligned
with our main findings regarding RLLM serving. We hope our work can provide the
research community and industry with insights to advance RLLM inference
serving.

Abstract: Casting complex inputs into tractable representations is a critical step
across various fields. Diverse embedding models emerge from differences in
architectures, loss functions, input modalities and datasets, each capturing
unique aspects of the input. Multi-teacher distillation leverages this
diversity to enrich representations but often remains tailored to specific
tasks. In this paper, we introduce a task-agnostic framework based on a
``majority vote" objective function. We demonstrate that this function is
bounded by the mutual information between student and teachers' embeddings,
leading to a task-agnostic distillation loss that eliminates dependence on
task-specific labels or prior knowledge. Our evaluations across text, vision
models, and molecular modeling show that our method effectively leverages
teacher diversity, resulting in representations enabling better performance for
a wide range of downstream tasks such as classification, clustering, or
regression. Additionally, we train and release state-of-the-art embedding
models, enhancing downstream performance in various modalities.

Motivation: 传统RL基于一步转移模型，而现实应用中（如能源管理、股票投资）智能体可以获得多步预测信息，但直接将预测嵌入MDP会导致状态空间指数级增长和维度诅咒。现有RL理论缺乏分析预测增强MDP的工具。

Method: 1) 提出贝叶斯价值函数来刻画最优预测感知策略；2) 开发Bellman-Jensen Gap分析来表征不完美预测的价值；3) 提出BOLA算法，分离离线贝叶斯价值学习和轻量级在线适应。

Conclusion: 提出的贝叶斯价值函数和BOLA算法有效解决了多步预测RL的挑战，为预测增强决策提供了理论保证和实用算法。

Abstract: Traditional reinforcement learning (RL) assumes the agents make decisions
based on Markov decision processes (MDPs) with one-step transition models. In
many real-world applications, such as energy management and stock investment,
agents can access multi-step predictions of future states, which provide
additional advantages for decision making. However, multi-step predictions are
inherently high-dimensional: naively embedding these predictions into an MDP
leads to an exponential blow-up in state space and the curse of dimensionality.
Moreover, existing RL theory provides few tools to analyze prediction-augmented
MDPs, as it typically works on one-step transition kernels and cannot
accommodate multi-step predictions with errors or partial action-coverage. We
address these challenges with three key innovations: First, we propose the
\emph{Bayesian value function} to characterize the optimal prediction-aware
policy tractably. Second, we develop a novel \emph{Bellman-Jensen Gap} analysis
on the Bayesian value function, which enables characterizing the value of
imperfect predictions. Third, we introduce BOLA (Bayesian Offline Learning with
Online Adaptation), a two-stage model-based RL algorithm that separates offline
Bayesian value learning from lightweight online adaptation to real-time
predictions. We prove that BOLA remains sample-efficient even under imperfect
predictions. We validate our theory and algorithm on synthetic MDPs and a
real-world wind energy storage control problem.

Abstract: Accurate weather forecasting across time scales is critical for anticipating
and mitigating the impacts of climate change. Recent data-driven methods based
on deep learning have achieved significant success in the medium range, but
struggle at longer subseasonal-to-seasonal (S2S) horizons due to error
accumulation in their autoregressive approach. In this work, we propose
OmniCast, a scalable and skillful probabilistic model that unifies weather
forecasting across timescales. OmniCast consists of two components: a VAE model
that encodes raw weather data into a continuous, lower-dimensional latent
space, and a diffusion-based transformer model that generates a sequence of
future latent tokens given the initial conditioning tokens. During training, we
mask random future tokens and train the transformer to estimate their
distribution given conditioning and visible tokens using a per-token diffusion
head. During inference, the transformer generates the full sequence of future
tokens by iteratively unmasking random subsets of tokens. This joint sampling
across space and time mitigates compounding errors from autoregressive
approaches. The low-dimensional latent space enables modeling long sequences of
future latent states, allowing the transformer to learn weather dynamics beyond
initial conditions. OmniCast performs competitively with leading probabilistic

*Joongkyu Lee,Seouh-won Yi,Min-hwan Oh*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出M-AUPO算法用于在线偏好强化学习，通过最大化子集内平均不确定性来选择多个动作，在Plackett-Luce排名反馈模型下实现了与子集大小直接相关的性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有偏好强化学习理论工作主要关注两两比较，少数研究探索了多比较和排名反馈，但其性能保证未能随反馈长度增加而改善甚至可能恶化。本文旨在利用更丰富的排名反馈信息提高样本效率。

Method: 采用Plackett-Luce模型处理动作子集的排名反馈，提出M-AUPO算法通过最大化子集内平均不确定性来选择多个动作进行排名比较。

Result: M-AUPO实现了$\tilde{\mathcal{O}}\left( \frac{d}{T} \sqrt{ \sum_{t=1}^T \frac{1}{|S_t|}} \right)$的次优性差距，其中$T$是总轮数，$d$是特征维度，$|S_t|$是第$t$轮子集大小。该结果避免了先前工作中对未知参数范数的指数依赖。

Conclusion: 这是首个在偏好强化学习排名反馈中明确显示子集大小与样本效率改善关系的理论结果，证明了更大子集直接带来性能提升。

Abstract: We study online preference-based reinforcement learning (PbRL) with the goal
of improving sample efficiency. While a growing body of theoretical work has
emerged-motivated by PbRL's recent empirical success, particularly in aligning
large language models (LLMs)-most existing studies focus only on pairwise
comparisons. A few recent works (Zhu et al., 2023, Mukherjee et al., 2024,
Thekumparampil et al., 2024) have explored using multiple comparisons and
ranking feedback, but their performance guarantees fail to improve-and can even
deteriorate-as the feedback length increases, despite the richer information
available. To address this gap, we adopt the Plackett-Luce (PL) model for
ranking feedback over action subsets and propose M-AUPO, an algorithm that
selects multiple actions by maximizing the average uncertainty within the
offered subset. We prove that M-AUPO achieves a suboptimality gap of
$\tilde{\mathcal{O}}\left( \frac{d}{T} \sqrt{ \sum_{t=1}^T \frac{1}{|S_t|}}
\right)$, where $T$ is the total number of rounds, $d$ is the feature
dimension, and $|S_t|$ is the size of the subset at round $t$. This result
shows that larger subsets directly lead to improved performance and, notably,
the bound avoids the exponential dependence on the unknown parameter's norm,
which was a fundamental limitation in most previous works. Moreover, we
establish a near-matching lower bound of $\Omega \left( \frac{d}{K \sqrt{T}}
\right)$, where $K$ is the maximum subset size. To the best of our knowledge,
this is the first theoretical result in PbRL with ranking feedback that
explicitly shows improved sample efficiency as a function of the subset size.

TL;DR: 提出STEAM方法，用于生成医疗治疗效应分析的合成数据，满足因果推断任务需求，在复杂数据生成过程中表现优异


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 真实医疗数据难以获取，现有生成方法未考虑下游因果推断任务（特别是治疗效应分析）的特殊需求

Method: 建立合成数据应满足的三个标准：保持协变量分布、治疗分配机制和结果生成机制，并提出STEAM方法优化这些标准

Result: STEAM在提出的评估指标上达到最先进性能，特别是在真实数据生成过程复杂时表现更佳

Conclusion: STEAM方法能有效生成适用于治疗效应分析的合成医疗数据，为因果推断研究提供重要工具

Abstract: Causal inference is essential for developing and evaluating medical
interventions, yet real-world medical datasets are often difficult to access
due to regulatory barriers. This makes synthetic data a potentially valuable
asset that enables these medical analyses, along with the development of new
inference methods themselves. Generative models can produce synthetic data that
closely approximate real data distributions, yet existing methods do not
consider the unique challenges that downstream causal inference tasks, and
specifically those focused on treatments, pose. We establish a set of
desiderata that synthetic data containing treatments should satisfy to maximise
downstream utility: preservation of (i) the covariate distribution, (ii) the
treatment assignment mechanism, and (iii) the outcome generation mechanism.
Based on these desiderata, we propose a set of evaluation metrics to assess
such synthetic data. Finally, we present STEAM: a novel method for generating
Synthetic data for Treatment Effect Analysis in Medicine that mimics the
data-generating process of data containing treatments and optimises for our
desiderata. We empirically demonstrate that STEAM achieves state-of-the-art
performance across our metrics as compared to existing generative models,
particularly as the complexity of the true data-generating process increases.

TL;DR: 提出L2O-CFGD方法，通过元学习动态调整Caputo分数梯度下降的超参数，解决了分数梯度下降在收敛性和超参数选择方面的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 分数梯度下降在优化中展现出加速潜力，但在收敛行为和超参数选择方面面临显著挑战，特别是在非凸设置中。

Method: 提出L2O-CFGD方法，元学习如何动态调整Caputo分数梯度下降的超参数，生成元学习调度策略。

Result: 元学习调度策略优于通过广泛搜索找到的静态超参数CFGD，在某些任务中性能可与完全黑盒元学习优化器相媲美。

Conclusion: L2O-CFGD可作为强大工具，帮助研究人员识别高性能超参数，并深入了解如何在优化中利用分数微积分的历史依赖性。

Abstract: Fractional Gradient Descent (FGD) offers a novel and promising way to
accelerate optimization by incorporating fractional calculus into machine
learning. Although FGD has shown encouraging initial results across various
optimization tasks, it faces significant challenges with convergence behavior
and hyperparameter selection. Moreover, the impact of its hyperparameters is
not fully understood, and scheduling them is particularly difficult in
non-convex settings such as neural network training. To address these issues,
we propose a novel approach called Learning to Optimize Caputo Fractional
Gradient Descent (L2O-CFGD), which meta-learns how to dynamically tune the
hyperparameters of Caputo FGD (CFGD). Our method's meta-learned schedule
outperforms CFGD with static hyperparameters found through an extensive search
and, in some tasks, achieves performance comparable to a fully black-box
meta-learned optimizer. L2O-CFGD can thus serve as a powerful tool for
researchers to identify high-performing hyperparameters and gain insights on
how to leverage the history-dependence of the fractional differential in
optimization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的低比特量化感知训练与原生训练之间仍存在较大的精度差距，需要新的方法来弥补这一差距。

Method: 基于多目标优化视角，在直通估计器梯度基础上添加曲率感知校正项，利用局部曲率信息来抵消量化引起的损失增加。

Result: 在预训练800M参数的Llama风格模型时，CAGE在W4A4量化下比异常值处理方法多恢复超过10%的量化损失。

Conclusion: 曲率感知梯度校正能够超越当前异常值处理方法，进一步缩小量化性能差距。

Abstract: Despite significant work on low-bit quantization-aware training (QAT), there
is still a large accuracy gap between such techniques and native training. To
address this, we introduce CAGE (Curvature-Aware Gradient Estimation), a new
QAT method that augments the straight-through estimator (STE) gradient with a
curvature-aware correction designed to counteract the loss increase induced by
quantization. CAGE is derived from a multi-objective view of QAT that balances
loss minimization with adherence to quantization constraints, yielding a
principled correction term that depends on local curvature information. On the
theoretical side, we introduce the notion of Pareto-optimal solutions for
quantized optimization, and establish that CAGE yields strong convergence
guarantees in the smooth non-convex setting. In terms of implementation, our
approach is optimizer-agnostic, but we provide a highly-efficient
implementation that leverages Adam statistics. When pre-training Llama-style
models of up to 800M-parameters, CAGE recovers over 10% of the
quantization-induced loss increase in the W4A4 regime over outlier-mitigation
methods. These results indicate that curvature-aware gradient corrections can
bridge the remaining performance gap beyond current outlier-handling methods.

Motivation: 在线主题模型能够处理随时间不断演化的数据流，与现实场景自然契合，但由于面临额外挑战，相比离线模型受到的关注较少。

Method: SB-SETM扩展了嵌入式主题模型(ETM)，使用截断的stick-breaking构造处理文档-主题分布，自动推断每个时间步的活动主题数量，并引入基于连续最优传输的主题嵌入合并策略。

Conclusion: SB-SETM成功解决了在线主题建模的挑战，能够有效处理连续演化的数据流，并在真实世界应用中表现出色。

Abstract: Online topic models are unsupervised algorithms to identify latent topics in
data streams that continuously evolve over time. Although these methods
naturally align with real-world scenarios, they have received considerably less
attention from the community compared to their offline counterparts, due to
specific additional challenges. To tackle these issues, we present SB-SETM, an
innovative model extending the Embedded Topic Model (ETM) to process data
streams by merging models formed on successive partial document batches. To
this end, SB-SETM (i) leverages a truncated stick-breaking construction for the
topic-per-document distribution, enabling the model to automatically infer from
the data the appropriate number of active topics at each timestep; and (ii)
introduces a merging strategy for topic embeddings based on a continuous
formulation of optimal transport adapted to the high dimensionality of the
latent topic space. Numerical experiments show SB-SETM outperforming baselines
on simulated scenarios. We extensively test it on a real-world corpus of news
articles covering the Russian-Ukrainian war throughout 2022-2023.

TL;DR: 提出连续时间神经网络模型，统一多种生物可信学习算法，无需分离推理和学习阶段。学习依赖于输入和误差信号的时间重叠，稳健学习需要突触可塑性时间尺度超过刺激持续时间1-2个数量级。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生物学习在连续时间中展开，但大多数算法模型依赖离散更新和分离的推理学习阶段。需要研究连续时间模型来统一生物可信学习算法并消除阶段分离需求。

Method: 开发连续时间神经网络模型，通过动态分析推导出SGD、FA、DFA、KP等学习规则作为极限情况。通过仿真验证在生物时间尺度下的稳定学习能力，分析时间重叠对学习的影响。

Result: 连续时间网络在生物时间尺度下稳定学习，即使存在时间错配和积分噪声。学习强度随输入与误差延迟增加而线性下降。稳健学习要求突触可塑性时间尺度（秒级）超过刺激持续时间（数十毫秒）1-2个数量级。

Conclusion: 连续时间模型统一了多种生物学习规则，揭示了时间重叠是学习的关键机制。秒级的资格迹是生物电路中误差驱动学习所必需的，这为理解生物学习提供了可测试的预测。

Abstract: Biological learning unfolds continuously in time, yet most algorithmic models
rely on discrete updates and separate inference and learning phases. We study a
continuous-time neural model that unifies several biologically plausible
learning algorithms and removes the need for phase separation. Rules including
stochastic gradient descent (SGD), feedback alignment (FA), direct feedback
alignment (DFA), and Kolen-Pollack (KP) emerge naturally as limiting cases of
the dynamics. Simulations show that these continuous-time networks stably learn
at biological timescales, even under temporal mismatches and integration noise.
Through analysis and simulation, we show that learning depends on temporal
overlap: a synapse updates correctly only when its input and the corresponding
error signal coincide in time. When inputs are held constant, learning strength
declines linearly as the delay between input and error approaches the stimulus
duration, explaining observed robustness and failure across network depths.
Critically, robust learning requires the synaptic plasticity timescale to
exceed the stimulus duration by one to two orders of magnitude. For typical
cortical stimuli (tens of milliseconds), this places the functional plasticity
window in the few-second range, a testable prediction that identifies
seconds-scale eligibility traces as necessary for error-driven learning in
biological circuits.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LOO方法计算成本高，而LRP作为高效替代方法在Transformer中的公理合理性尚未充分验证。

Method: 分析AttnLRP的双线性传播规则违反实现不变性公理，并重新评估CP-LRP作为诊断基线，比较绕过softmax传播与LOO的对齐度。

Result: 双线性传播规则在理论分析和线性注意力层实验中都违反实现不变性；绕过softmax的CP-LRP在Transformer中后层与LOO对齐更好。

Conclusion: 双线性因子化敏感性和softmax传播误差共同削弱了LRP在Transformer中近似LOO的能力。

Abstract: Leave-One-Out (LOO) provides an intuitive measure of feature importance but
is computationally prohibitive. While Layer-Wise Relevance Propagation (LRP)
offers a potentially efficient alternative, its axiomatic soundness in modern
Transformers remains largely under-examined. In this work, we first show that
the bilinear propagation rules used in recent advances of AttnLRP violate the
implementation invariance axiom. We prove this analytically and confirm it
empirically in linear attention layers. Second, we also revisit CP-LRP as a
diagnostic baseline and find that bypassing relevance propagation through the
softmax layer -- backpropagating relevance only through the value matrices --
significantly improves alignment with LOO, particularly in middle-to-late
Transformer layers. Overall, our results suggest that (i) bilinear
factorization sensitivity and (ii) softmax propagation error potentially
jointly undermine LRP's ability to approximate LOO in Transformers.

Abstract: Iterative optimization is central to modern artificial intelligence (AI) and
provides a crucial framework for understanding adaptive systems. This review
provides a unified perspective on this subject, bridging classic theory with
neural network training and biological learning. Although gradient-based
methods, powered by the efficient but biologically implausible backpropagation
(BP), dominate machine learning, their computational demands can hinder
scalability in high-dimensional settings. In contrast, derivative-free or
zeroth-order (ZO) optimization feature computationally lighter approaches that
rely only on function evaluations and randomness. While generally less sample
efficient, recent breakthroughs demonstrate that modern ZO methods can
effectively approximate gradients and achieve performance competitive with BP
in neural network models. This ZO paradigm is also particularly relevant for
biology. Its core principles of random exploration (probing) and
feedback-guided adaptation (reinforcing) parallel key mechanisms of biological
learning, offering a mathematically principled perspective on how the brain
learns. In this review, we begin by categorizing optimization approaches based
on the order of derivative information they utilize, ranging from first-,
second-, and higher-order gradient-based to ZO methods. We then explore how
these methods are adapted to the unique challenges of neural network training
and the resulting learning dynamics. Finally, we build upon these insights to
view biological learning through an optimization lens, arguing that a ZO
paradigm leverages the brain's intrinsic noise as a computational resource.
This framework not only illuminates our understanding of natural intelligence
but also holds vast implications for neuromorphic hardware, helping us design
fast and energy-efficient AI systems that exploit intrinsic hardware noise.

Motivation: 为了解决传统强化学习方法在语言模型推理任务中需要复杂奖励设计和多次推理过程的问题，寻求一种更简单高效的训练范式。

Method: 采用在线监督微调方法，模型生成自己的响应后立即进行微调，无需外部奖励信号，仅需单次推理过程。

Result: 在具有挑战性的数学推理任务上，OSFT达到了与基于可验证奖励的强化学习方法（如GRPO）相当的下游性能。消融研究进一步证明了OSFT的效率和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: OSFT通过促进模型在预训练中学习到的潜在偏好知识，有效提升了推理能力，为复杂奖励驱动训练范式提供了一个高效且有前景的替代方案。

Abstract: We present a simple, self-help online supervised finetuning (OSFT) paradigm
for LLM reasoning. In this paradigm, the model generates its own responses and
is immediately finetuned on this self-generated data. OSFT is a highly
efficient training strategy for LLM reasoning, as it is reward-free and uses
just one rollout by default. Experiment results show that OSFT achieves
downstream performance on challenging mathematical reasoning tasks comparable
to strong reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) methods such as
GRPO. Our ablation study further demonstrates the efficiency and robustness of
OSFT. The major mechanism of OSFT lies in facilitating the model's own existing
preference (latent knowledge) learned from pretraining, which leads to
reasoning ability improvement. We believe that OSFT offers an efficient and
promising alternative to more complex, reward-based training paradigms. Our
code is available at https://github.com/ElementQi/OnlineSFT.

Motivation: 传统的RLVR方法依赖精心设计的任务查询和真实答案，需要大量人工投入，阻碍了RL的扩展过程。现有任务合成方法难以控制生成任务的难度，无法为RL训练提供有效优势。

Method: 采用自博弈训练框架，LLM同时扮演任务提出者（生成有明确定义答案且难度递增的搜索查询）和问题解决者（处理生成的搜索查询并输出正确答案）。通过收集搜索轨迹作为外部知识，使用RAG验证查询是否可正确回答。

Result: SSP在各种基准测试中显著提升了搜索代理的性能，无需任何监督，在从头开始和持续RL训练设置下均表现一致。

Conclusion: SSP方法通过任务提出者和解决者的协同进化，实现了可扩展的智能体RLVR训练，为搜索代理的自监督学习提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has become the
mainstream technique for training LLM agents. However, RLVR highly depends on
well-crafted task queries and corresponding ground-truth answers to provide
accurate rewards, which requires massive human efforts and hinders the RL
scaling processes, especially under agentic scenarios. Although a few recent
works explore task synthesis methods, the difficulty of generated agentic tasks
can hardly be controlled to provide effective RL training advantages. To
achieve agentic RLVR with higher scalability, we explore self-play training for
deep search agents, in which the learning LLM utilizes multi-turn search engine
calling and acts simultaneously as both a task proposer and a problem solver.
The task proposer aims to generate deep search queries with well-defined
ground-truth answers and increasing task difficulty. The problem solver tries
to handle the generated search queries and output the correct answer
predictions. To ensure that each generated search query has accurate ground
truth, we collect all the searching results from the proposer's trajectory as
external knowledge, then conduct retrieval-augmentation generation (RAG) to
test whether the proposed query can be correctly answered with all necessary
search documents provided. In this search self-play (SSP) game, the proposer
and the solver co-evolve their agent capabilities through both competition and
cooperation. With substantial experimental results, we find that SSP can
significantly improve search agents' performance uniformly on various
benchmarks without any supervision under both from-scratch and continuous RL
training setups. The code is at https://github.com/Alibaba-Quark/SSP.

Abstract: We introduce \textbf{BO4Mob}, a new benchmark framework for high-dimensional
Bayesian Optimization (BO), driven by the challenge of origin-destination (OD)
travel demand estimation in large urban road networks. Estimating OD travel
demand from limited traffic sensor data is a difficult inverse optimization
problem, particularly in real-world, large-scale transportation networks. This
problem involves optimizing over high-dimensional continuous spaces where each
objective evaluation is computationally expensive, stochastic, and
non-differentiable. BO4Mob comprises five scenarios based on real-world San
Jose, CA road networks, with input dimensions scaling up to 10,100. These
scenarios utilize high-resolution, open-source traffic simulations that
incorporate realistic nonlinear and stochastic dynamics. We demonstrate the
benchmark's utility by evaluating five optimization methods: three
state-of-the-art BO algorithms and two non-BO baselines. This benchmark is
designed to support both the development of scalable optimization algorithms
and their application for the design of data-driven urban mobility models,

Abstract: Value-based algorithms are a cornerstone of off-policy reinforcement learning
due to their simplicity and training stability. However, their use has
traditionally been restricted to discrete action spaces, as they rely on
estimating Q-values for individual state-action pairs. In continuous action
spaces, evaluating the Q-value over the entire action space becomes
computationally infeasible. To address this, actor-critic methods are typically
employed, where a critic is trained on off-policy data to estimate Q-values,
and an actor is trained to maximize the critic's output. Despite their
popularity, these methods often suffer from instability during training. In
this work, we propose a purely value-based framework for continuous control
that revisits structural maximization of Q-functions, introducing a set of key
architectural and algorithmic choices to enable efficient and stable learning.
We evaluate the proposed actor-free Q-learning approach on a range of standard
simulation tasks, demonstrating performance and sample efficiency on par with
state-of-the-art baselines, without the cost of learning a separate actor.
Particularly, in environments with constrained action spaces, where the value
functions are typically non-smooth, our method with structural maximization
outperforms traditional actor-critic methods with gradient-based maximization.

Abstract: Counterfactual inference provides a mathematical framework for reasoning
about hypothetical outcomes under alternative interventions, bridging causal
reasoning and predictive modeling. We present a counterfactual inference
framework for individualized risk estimation and intervention analysis,
illustrated through a clinical application to post-acute sequelae of COVID-19
(PASC) among patients with pre-existing heart failure (HF). Using longitudinal
diagnosis, laboratory, and medication data from a large health-system cohort,
we integrate regularized predictive modeling with counterfactual search to
identify actionable pathways to PASC-related HF hospital admissions. The
framework combines exact enumeration with optimization-based methods, including
the Nearest Instance Counterfactual Explanations (NICE) and Multi-Objective
Counterfactuals (MOC) algorithms, to efficiently explore high-dimensional
intervention spaces. Applied to more than 2700 individuals with confirmed
SARS-CoV-2 infection and prior HF, the model achieved strong discriminative
performance (AUROC: 0.88, 95% CI: 0.84-0.91) and generated interpretable,
patient-specific counterfactuals that quantify how modifying comorbidity
patterns or treatment factors could alter predicted outcomes. This work
demonstrates how counterfactual reasoning can be formalized as an optimization
problem over predictive functions, offering a rigorous, interpretable, and
computationally efficient approach to personalized inference in complex
biomedical systems.

Method: 使用Llama和Qwen等语言模型家族，在指令遵循、通用知识和算术推理等任务上系统比较SFT和RL的遗忘模式，并通过简化设置分析RL模式寻求特性的原因。

Result: RL在所有实验设置中都表现出比SFT更少的遗忘，同时目标任务性能相当或更高。研究发现RL使用on-policy数据的模式寻求特性是其抗遗忘能力的关键。

Conclusion: RL比SFT在语言模型后训练中更能有效缓解灾难性遗忘，其核心机制在于on-policy数据的模式寻求特性，这为使用近似on-policy数据高效减轻遗忘提供了实用启示。

Abstract: Adapting language models (LMs) to new tasks via post-training carries the
risk of degrading existing capabilities -- a phenomenon classically known as
catastrophic forgetting. In this paper, toward identifying guidelines for
mitigating this phenomenon, we systematically compare the forgetting patterns
of two widely adopted post-training methods: supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and
reinforcement learning (RL). Our experiments reveal a consistent trend across
LM families (Llama, Qwen) and tasks (instruction following, general knowledge,
and arithmetic reasoning): RL leads to less forgetting than SFT while achieving
comparable or higher target task performance. To investigate the cause for this
difference, we consider a simplified setting in which the LM is modeled as a
mixture of two distributions, one corresponding to prior knowledge and the
other to the target task. We identify that the mode-seeking nature of RL, which
stems from its use of on-policy data, enables keeping prior knowledge intact
when learning the target task. We then verify this insight by demonstrating
that the use on-policy data underlies the robustness of RL to forgetting in
practical settings, as opposed to other algorithmic choices such as the KL
regularization or advantage estimation. Lastly, as a practical implication, our
results highlight the potential of mitigating forgetting using approximately
on-policy data, which can be substantially more efficient to obtain than fully
on-policy data.

TL;DR: 将大规模大气和海洋AI模型从PyTorch迁移到MindSpore框架，并针对国产芯片进行优化，以降低对GPU的依赖，提升硬件独立性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI气候和天气研究模型（如FourCastNet、AI-GOMS）严重依赖GPU，限制了硬件独立性，特别是对中国国产硬件和框架的支持不足。

Method: 开发迁移框架，包括软件-硬件适配、内存优化和并行化处理，将模型从PyTorch迁移到MindSpore，并针对国产芯片进行优化。

Abstract: With the growing role of artificial intelligence in climate and weather
research, efficient model training and inference are in high demand. Current
models like FourCastNet and AI-GOMS depend heavily on GPUs, limiting hardware
independence, especially for Chinese domestic hardware and frameworks. To
address this issue, we present a framework for migrating large-scale
atmospheric and oceanic models from PyTorch to MindSpore and optimizing for
Chinese chips, and evaluating their performance against GPUs. The framework
focuses on software-hardware adaptation, memory optimization, and parallelism.
Furthermore, the model's performance is evaluated across multiple metrics,
including training speed, inference speed, model accuracy, and energy
efficiency, with comparisons against GPU-based implementations. Experimental
results demonstrate that the migration and optimization process preserves the
models' original accuracy while significantly reducing system dependencies and
improving operational efficiency by leveraging Chinese chips as a viable
alternative for scientific computing. This work provides valuable insights and
practical guidance for leveraging Chinese domestic chips and frameworks in
atmospheric and oceanic AI model development, offering a pathway toward greater
technological independence.

Abstract: Recent advances in distributed learning systems have introduced effective
solutions for implementing collaborative artificial intelligence techniques in
wireless communication networks. Federated learning approaches provide a
model-aggregation mechanism among edge devices to achieve collaborative
training, while ensuring data security, communication efficiency, and sharing
computational overheads. On the other hand, limited transmission resources and
complex communication environments remain significant bottlenecks to the
efficient collaborations among edge devices, particularly within large-scale
networks. To address such issues, this paper proposes an over-the-air (OTA)
analog aggregation method designed for the distributed swarm learning (DSL),
termed DSL-OTA, aiming to enhance communication efficiency, enable effective
cooperation, and ensure privacy preserving. Incorporating multi-worker
selection strategy with over-the-air aggregation not only makes the standard
DSL based on single best worker contributing to global model update to become
more federated, but also secures the aggregation from potential risks of data
leakage. Our theoretical analyses verify the advantages of the proposed DSL-OTA
algorithm in terms of fast convergence rate and low communication costs.
Simulation results reveal that our DSL-OTA outperforms the other existing
methods by achieving better learning performance under both homogeneous and
heterogeneous dataset settings.

Abstract: Large-scale GPU traces play a critical role in identifying performance
bottlenecks within heterogeneous High-Performance Computing (HPC)
architectures. However, the sheer volume and complexity of a single trace of
data make performance analysis both computationally expensive and
time-consuming. To address this challenge, we present an end-to-end parallel
performance analysis framework designed to handle multiple large-scale GPU
traces efficiently. Our proposed framework partitions and processes trace data
concurrently and employs causal graph methods and parallel coordinating chart
to expose performance variability and dependencies across execution flows.
Experimental results demonstrate a 67% improvement in terms of scalability,
highlighting the effectiveness of our pipeline for analyzing multiple traces
independently.

TL;DR: SLICE是一个针对边缘计算场景中差异化SLO需求的创新调度解决方案，通过结合效用最大化请求调度算法和动态迭代生成率控制机制，显著提升了LLM推理服务的SLO达成率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有调度系统仅以最大化输出token吞吐量为优化目标，无法满足边缘设备对TTFT、TPOT和端到端延迟等差异化SLO需求，导致SLO违规率居高不下。

Method: 结合效用最大化请求调度算法与动态迭代生成率控制机制。

Result: 相比最先进解决方案Orca和FastServe，SLICE实现了高达35倍的SLO达成率提升和3.4倍的任务完成时间优势。

Conclusion: SLICE能有效解决边缘计算场景中LLM服务的差异化SLO需求问题，显著提升服务质量。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), as the foundational architecture for
next-generation interactive AI applications, not only power intelligent
dialogue systems but also drive the evolution of embodied intelligence on edge
devices, including humanoid robots, smart vehicles, and other scenarios. The
applications running on these edge devices impose differentiated Service Level
Objectives (SLO) requirements on LLM services, specifically manifested as
distinct constraints on Time to First Token (TTFT) and Time Per Output Token
(TPOT) as well as end-to-end latency. Notably, edge devices typically handle
real-time tasks that are extremely sensitive to latency, such as machine
control and navigation planning. However, existing scheduling service systems
still prioritize maximizing output token throughput as the sole optimization
objective, failing to adequately address the diversity of SLO requirements.
This ultimately results in persistently high violation rates for end-to-end
latency or TPOT related SLOs.
  This paper proposes SLICE, an innovative scheduling solution designed for
edge computing scenarios with differentiated SLO requirements. By combining a
utility-maximizing request scheduling algorithm with a dynamic iterative
control mechanism for generation rates, SLICE significantly improves LLM
inference service SLO attainment. Experimental results demonstrate that
compared to state-of-the-art solutions Orca and FastServe, SLICE achieves up to
35x higher SLO attainment and 3.4x advantage in task completion time than the
other two solutions.

TL;DR: Tokencake是一个针对多智能体应用的KV缓存优化框架，通过空间调度和时间调度解决缓存争用和内存闲置问题，显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多智能体应用中使用外部函数调用导致KV缓存面临严重性能挑战：空间争用导致关键智能体缓存被逐出，时间利用率低导致GPU内存闲置。

Method: 采用智能体感知设计，空间调度器使用动态内存分区保护关键智能体免受争用，时间调度器使用主动卸载和预测性上传机制在函数调用停滞期间重新利用GPU内存。

Result: 在代表性多智能体基准测试中，相比vLLM，Tokencake可将端到端延迟降低超过47.06%，GPU内存有效利用率提升高达16.9%。

Conclusion: Tokencake通过协同优化调度和内存管理，有效解决了多智能体应用中KV缓存的性能瓶颈问题。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in complex multi-agent
applications that use external function calls. This workload creates severe
performance challenges for the KV Cache: space contention leads to the eviction
of critical agents' caches and time underutilization leaves the cache of agents
stalled on long-running tool calls idling in GPU memory. We present Tokencake,
a KV-Cache-centric serving framework that co-optimizes scheduling and memory
management with an agent-aware design. Tokencake's Space Scheduler uses dynamic
memory partitioning to shield critical agents from contention, while its Time
Scheduler employs a proactive offload and predictive upload mechanism to
repurpose GPU memory during function call stalls. Our evaluation on
representative multi-agent benchmarks shows that Tokencake can reduce
end-to-end latency by over 47.06%, improve effective GPU memory utilization by
up to 16.9% compared to vLLM.

TL;DR: 本文提出了新的通信高效的分布式交互式证明协议，用于验证平面图问题，显著降低了证明规模和交互轮数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 分布式交互式证明(DIP)由Kol等人提出，旨在通过中心化证明者与分布式验证者之间的交互来验证图的性质。传统方法通信开销较大，需要设计更高效的协议。

Method: 设计了基于迭代对数轮数的DIP协议，针对嵌入平面图和一般平面图分别采用不同的证明规模策略，通过多轮交互减少通信量。

Result: 实现了O(log* n)轮交互的DIP协议，嵌入平面图的证明规模为O(1)，一般平面图为O(⌈log Δ/log* n⌉)。更一般地，对于任意1≤r≤log* n，存在O(r)轮协议，证明规模分别为O(log^(r)n)和O(log^(r)n + log Δ/r)。

Conclusion: 该工作显著改进了平面图验证的分布式交互式证明效率，为图论性质验证提供了更实用的通信高效解决方案。

Abstract: We provide new communication-efficient distributed interactive proofs for
planarity. The notion of a \emph{distributed interactive proof (DIP)} was
introduced by Kol, Oshman, and Saxena (PODC 2018). In a DIP, the \emph{prover}
is a single centralized entity whose goal is to prove a certain claim regarding
an input graph $G$. To do so, the prover communicates with a distributed
\emph{verifier} that operates concurrently on all $n$ nodes of $G$. A DIP is
measured by the amount of prover-verifier communication it requires. Namely,
the goal is to design a DIP with a small number of interaction rounds and a
small \emph{proof size}, i.e., a small amount of communication per round. Our
main result is an $O(\log ^{*}n)$-round DIP protocol for embedded planarity and
planarity with a proof size of $O(1)$ and $O(\lceil\log \Delta/\log
^{*}n\rceil)$, respectively. In fact, this result can be generalized as
follows. For any $1\leq r\leq \log^{*}n$, there exists an $O(r)$-round protocol
for embedded planarity and planarity with a proof size of $O(\log ^{(r)}n)$ and
$O(\log ^{(r)}n+\log \Delta /r)$, respectively.

Abstract: Performance regressions in large-scale software systems can lead to
substantial resource inefficiencies, making their early detection critical.
Frequent benchmarking is essential for identifying these regressions and
maintaining service-level agreements (SLAs). Performance benchmarks, however,
are resource-intensive and time-consuming, which is a major challenge for
integration into Continuous Integration / Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)
pipelines. Although numerous benchmark optimization techniques have been
proposed to accelerate benchmark execution, there is currently no practical
system that integrates these optimizations seamlessly into real-world CI/CD
pipelines. In this vision paper, we argue that the field of benchmark
optimization remains under-explored in key areas that hinder its broader
adoption. We identify three central challenges to enabling frequent and
efficient benchmarking: (a) the composability of benchmark optimization
strategies, (b) automated evaluation of benchmarking results, and (c) the
usability and complexity of applying these strategies as part of CI/CD systems
in practice. We also introduce a conceptual cloud-based benchmarking framework
handling these challenges transparently. By presenting these open problems, we
aim to stimulate research toward making performance regression detection in
CI/CD systems more practical and effective.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型虽然性能优异但推理延迟高，量化会降低性能，推测解码虽然无损但通常带来额外开销，需要一种既能加速推理又保持性能的方法。

Method: 使用全模型部分权重位形成量化草稿模型，无需额外训练或存储，通过可重构处理单元阵列高效执行草稿生成和验证过程。

Result: 在15个LLM和任务上，SPEQ相比FP16、Olive和Tender分别实现了2.07倍、1.53倍和1.45倍的加速。

Conclusion: SPEQ通过算法-硬件协同设计，在保持无损推理的同时显著加速大语言模型推理，且无需额外训练或存储开销。

Abstract: Large language models achieve impressive performance across diverse tasks but
exhibit high inference latency due to their large parameter sizes. While
quantization reduces model size, it often leads to performance degradation
compared to the full model. Speculative decoding remains lossless but typically
incurs extra overheads. We propose SPEQ, an algorithm-hardware co-designed
speculative decoding method that uses part of the full-model weight bits to
form a quantized draft model, thereby eliminating additional training or
storage overhead. A reconfigurable processing element array enables efficient
execution of both the draft and verification passes. Experimental results
across 15 LLMs and tasks demonstrate that SPEQ achieves speedups of 2.07x,
1.53x, and 1.45x compared over FP16, Olive, and Tender, respectively.
