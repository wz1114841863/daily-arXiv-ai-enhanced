We present the first LLM serving engine that supports cross-model prefix cache reuse between base and adapted models via Activated LoRA (aLoRA), enabling efficient and fine-grained adapter switching during inference. Our design extends the vLLM framework by introducing base-aligned block hashing and activation-aware masking within the model execution path, permitting cache reuse across models while preserving compatibility with existing serving engine optimizations. Integrated into a production-grade inference stack, this approach supports dynamic adapter activation without excessive key-value tensor recomputation. Evaluation across representative multi-turn, multi-adapter pipelines demonstrates up to 58x end-to-end latency reduction and over 100x time-to-first-token improvement relative to standard LoRA baselines, with benefits that scale with model size and sequence length and manifest across all stages of the request lifecycle. This work bridges parameter-efficient model adaptation with high-performance serving, providing the first complete realization of cross-model KV-cache reuse in modern LLM inference engines."}

Current HBM stacks include short on-die ECC that tightens binning, raises price, and fixes reliability policy inside the device. This paper asks whether a system can tolerate a much higher raw HBM bit error rate and still keep end-to-end correctness and throughput, without changing the HBM PHY or the fixed 32 B transaction size. We propose REACH, a controller managed ECC design that keeps the HBM link and 32 B transfers unchanged. REACH uses a two level Reed-Solomon scheme: each 32 B chunk uses an inner code to check and correct most faults locally, while chunks that cannot be fixed are marked as erasures. An outer code spans kilobytes and runs in erasure only mode, repairing only flagged chunks and avoiding the expensive locator step. For small random writes, REACH updates outer parity with differential parity to avoid recomputing parity over the whole span, and an optional importance adaptive bit plane policy can protect only critical fields such as BF16 exponents to reduce ECC work and traffic. On three LLMs at 8K context, REACH keeps about 79 percent of on-die ECC throughput at zero BER and remains qualified up to a raw BER of 1e-3, extending tolerable device error rates by about three orders of magnitude while keeping tokens per second nearly flat. In ASAP7, a full REACH controller occupies 15.2 mm2 and consumes 17.5 W at 3.56 TB/s, and it reduces ECC area by 11.6x and power by about 60 percent compared to a naive long Reed-Solomon baseline. By moving strong ECC into the controller, REACH turns long code reliability into a system choice that can enable lower cost HBM under the same standard interface."}

Accurate prediction of LC mortality rates is crucial for guiding targeted interventions and addressing health disparities. Although traditional regression-based models have been commonly used, explainable machine learning models may offer enhanced predictive accuracy and deeper insights into the factors influencing LC mortality. This study applied three models: random forest (RF), gradient boosting regression (GBR), and linear regression (LR) to predict county-level LC mortality rates across the United States. Model performance was evaluated using R-squared and root mean squared error (RMSE). Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) values were used to determine variable importance and their directional impact. Geographic disparities in LC mortality were analyzed through Getis-Ord (Gi*) hotspot analysis. The RF model outperformed both GBR and LR, achieving an R2 value of 41.9% and an RMSE of 12.8. SHAP analysis identified smoking rate as the most important predictor, followed by median home value and the percentage of the Hispanic ethnic population. Spatial analysis revealed significant clusters of elevated LC mortality in the mid-eastern counties of the United States. The RF model demonstrated superior predictive performance for LC mortality rates, emphasizing the critical roles of smoking prevalence, housing values, and the percentage of Hispanic ethnic population.

Monotonicity constraints align model behavior with domain knowledge, but their performance cost - the price of monotonicity - is not well quantified.

We define the Price of Monotonicity (PoM) as the relative change in standard performance metrics when moving from unconstrained to constrained models, estimated via paired comparisons with bootstrap uncertainty. In our experiments, PoM in AUC ranges from essentially zero to about 2.9 percent: constraints are almost costless on large datasets (typically less than 0.2 percent, often indistinguishable from zero) and most costly on smaller datasets with extensive constraint coverage (around 2-3 percent).

To efficiently perform DRAM writes, modern systems buffer write requests and try to complete multiple write operations whenever the DRAM mode is switched from read to write. When the DRAM system is performing writes, it is not available to service read requests, thus increasing read latency and reducing performance. We observe that, given the presence of on-die ECC in DDR5 devices, the time to perform a write operation varies significantly: from 1x (for writes to banks of different bankgroups) to 6x (for writes to banks within the same bankgroup) to 24x (for conflicting requests to the same bank). If we can orchestrate the write stream to favor write requests that incur lower latency, then we can reduce the stall time from DRAM writes and improve performance. However, for current systems, the write stream is dictated by the cache replacement policy, which makes eviction decisions without being aware of the variable latency of DRAM writes. The key insight of our work is to improve performance by modifying the cache replacement policy to increase bank-parallelism of DRAM writes.\n  Our paper proposes {\\em BARD (Bank-Aware Replacement Decisions)}, which modifies the cache replacement policy to favor dirty lines that belong to banks without pending writes. We analyze two variants of BARD: BARD-E (Eviction-based), which changes the eviction policy to evict low-cost dirty lines, and BARD-C (Cleansing-Based), which proactively cleans low-cost dirty lines without modifying the eviction decisions. We develop a hybrid policy (BARD-H), which uses a selective combination of both eviction and writeback. Our evaluations across workloads from SPEC2017, LIGRA, STREAM, and Google server traces show that BARD-H improves performance by 4.3\\% on average and up-to 8.5\\%.

However, this architecture introduces a fundamental bottleneck: key/value (KV) tensors generated during prefill must be transferred to decode workers, and existing systems rely on RDMA-based network paths for this exchange. As model sizes and context lengths increase, KV transfer dominates both time-to-first-token (TTFT) and peak throughput, and remains highly sensitive to network contention even when prefix reuse is high. This paper presents TraCT, a rack-scale LLM serving system that uses CXL shared memory as both a KV-transfer substrate and a rack-wide prefix-aware KV cache. TraCT enables GPUs to write and read KV blocks directly through CXL load/store and DMA operations, eliminating the NIC hop that constrains existing disaggregated pipelines. However, to realize this design, multiple new challenges such as synchronization, consistency, and data management on non-coherent CXL memory need to be addressed. TraCT proposes various software solutions such as the two-tier inter-node synchronization mechanism to address these challenges. We implement TraCT on the Dynamo LLM inference framework and show that, across static and synthetic workloads, TraCT reduces average TTFT by up to 9.8x, lowers P99 latency by up to 6.2x, and improves peak throughput by up to 1.6x compared to RDMA and DRAM-based caching baselines."}

However, the reliability of CiM-based systems is challenged by stuck-at faults (SAFs) in memory cells, which corrupt stored weights and lead to accuracy degradation. While closest value mapping (CVM) has been shown to partially mitigate these effects for multibit DNNs deployed on bit-sliced crossbars, its fault tolerance is often insufficient under high SAF rates or for complex tasks. In this work, we propose two training-free weight transformation techniques, sign-flip and bit-flip, that enhance SAF tolerance in multi-bit DNNs deployed on bit-sliced crossbar arrays. Sign-flip operates at the weight-column level by selecting between a weight and its negation, whereas bit-flip provides finer granularity by selectively inverting individual bit slices. Both methods expand the search space for fault-aware mappings, operate synergistically with CVM, and require no retraining or additional memory. To enable scalability, we introduce a look-up-table (LUT)-based framework that accelerates the computation of optimal transformations and supports rapid evaluation across models and fault rates. Extensive experiments on ResNet-18, ResNet-50, and ViT models with CIFAR-100 and ImageNet demonstrate that the proposed techniques recover most of the accuracy lost under SAF injection. Hardware analysis shows that these methods incur negligible overhead, with sign-flip leading to negligible energy, latency, and area cost, and bit-flip providing higher fault resilience with modest overheads. These results establish sign-flip and bit-flip as practical and scalable SAF-mitigation strategies for CiM-based DNN accelerators."}

We present CodeGEMM, a codebook-centric GEMM kernel that replaces dequantization with precomputed inner products between centroids and activations stored in a lightweight Psumbook. At inference, code indices directly gather these partial sums, eliminating per-element lookups and reducing the on-chip footprint.

Moreover, their high memory footprint limits the number of workers that can execute concurrently. We propose a novel GPU solution for vertex cover problems that detects when a graph splits into components and branches on the components independently. Although the need to aggregate the solutions of different components introduces non-tail-recursive branches which interfere with load balancing, we overcome this challenge by delegating the post-processing to the last descendant of each branch. We also reduce the memory footprint by reducing the graph and inducing a subgraph before exploring the search tree.

We propose an adaptation framework built upon a Masked Autoencoder backbone and evaluate its performance under a Leave-One-Dataset-Out validation protocol across five open HAR datasets. Our experiments demonstrate that both LoRA and QLoRA can match the recognition performance of full fine-tuning while significantly reducing the number of trainable parameters, memory usage, and training time. Further analyses reveal that LoRA maintains robust performance even under limited supervision and that the adapter rank provides a controllable trade-off between accuracy and efficiency. QLoRA extends these benefits by reducing the memory footprint of frozen weights through quantization, with minimal impact on classification quality."}

Meanwhile, serverless computing, with its elasticity and pay-per-use billing, is well-suited for deploying MoEs with bursty workloads. However, the large number of experts in MoE models incurs high inference costs due to memory-intensive parameter caching. These costs are difficult to mitigate via simple model partitioning due to input-dependent expert activation. To address these issues, we propose Remoe, a heterogeneous MoE inference system tailored for serverless computing. Remoe assigns non-expert modules to GPUs and expert modules to CPUs, and further offloads infrequently activated experts to separate serverless functions to reduce memory overhead and enable parallel execution. We incorporate three key techniques: (1) a Similar Prompts Searching (SPS) algorithm to predict expert activation patterns based on semantic similarity of inputs; (2) a Main Model Pre-allocation (MMP) algorithm to ensure service-level objectives (SLOs) via worst-case memory estimation; and (3) a joint memory and replica optimization framework leveraging Lagrangian duality and the Longest Processing Time (LPT) algorithm. We implement Remoe on Kubernetes and evaluate it across multiple LLM benchmarks. Experimental results show that Remoe reduces inference cost by up to 57% and cold start latency by 47% compared to state-of-the-art baselines."}

However, existing methods often fail to distinguish between the movements of users in familiar and unfamiliar regions. To address this, we propose MoE-TransMov, a Transformer-based model with a Transformer model with a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture designed to use one framework to capture distinct mobility patterns across different moving contexts without requiring separate training for certain data. Using user-check-in data, we classify movements into familiar and unfamiliar categories and develop a specialized expert network to improve prediction accuracy. Our approach integrates self-attention mechanisms and adaptive gating networks to dynamically select the most relevant expert models for different mobility contexts. Experiments on two real-world datasets, including the widely used but small open-source Foursquare NYC dataset and the large-scale Kyoto dataset collected with LY Corporation (Yahoo Japan Corporation), show that MoE-TransMov outperforms state-of-the-art baselines with notable improvements in Top-1, Top-5, Top-10 accuracy, and mean reciprocal rank (MRR).

However, statistical heterogeneity arising from non-identically distributed local data creates a fundamental challenge: nodes must learn personalized models adapted to their local distributions while selectively collaborating with compatible peers. Existing approaches either enforce a single global model that fits no one well, or rely on heuristic peer selection mechanisms that cannot distinguish between peers with genuinely incompatible data distributions and those with valuable complementary knowledge. We present Murmura, a framework that leverages evidential deep learning to enable trust-aware model personalization in DFL. Our key insight is that epistemic uncertainty from Dirichlet-based evidential models directly indicates peer compatibility: high epistemic uncertainty when a peer's model evaluates local data reveals distributional mismatch, enabling nodes to exclude incompatible influence while maintaining personalized models through selective collaboration. Murmura introduces a trust-aware aggregation mechanism that computes peer compatibility scores through cross-evaluation on local validation samples and personalizes model aggregation based on evidential trust with adaptive thresholds. Evaluation on three wearable IoT datasets (UCI HAR, PAMAP2, PPG-DaLiA) demonstrates that Murmura reduces performance degradation from IID to non-IID conditions compared to baseline (0.9% vs. 19.3%), achieves 7.4$\\times$ faster convergence, and maintains stable accuracy across hyperparameter choices.

Federated Learning (FL), in which raw data never leaves local devices, has shown promise in overcoming these limitations. Although FL has grown rapidly in recent years, it still struggles with heterogeneity, which produces gradient noise, client-drift, and increased variance from partial client participation. In this paper, we propose FedOAED, a novel federated learning algorithm designed to mitigate client-drift arising from multiple local training updates and the variance induced by partial client participation.

As these systems are increasingly deployed in critical areas, ensuring their privacy and alignment with human values is paramount. Recently, selective forgetting (also known as machine unlearning) has shown promise for privacy and data removal tasks, and has emerged as a transformative paradigm shift in the field of AI. It refers to the ability of a model to selectively erase the influence of previously seen data, which is especially important for compliance with modern data protection regulations and for aligning models with human values. Despite its promise, selective forgetting raises significant privacy concerns, especially when the data involved come from sensitive domains. While new unlearning-induced privacy attacks are continuously proposed, each is shown to outperform its predecessors using different experimental settings, which can lead to overly optimistic and potentially unfair assessments that may disproportionately favor one particular attack over the others. In this work, we present the first comprehensive benchmark for evaluating privacy vulnerabilities in selective forgetting. We extensively investigate privacy vulnerabilities of machine unlearning techniques and benchmark privacy leakage across a wide range of victim data, state-of-the-art unlearning privacy attacks, unlearning methods, and model architectures. We systematically evaluate and identify critical factors related to unlearning-induced privacy leakage.

In the last decade, deep learning recommender models (DLRMs) are the de-facto standard in this field. The main bottleneck in DLRM inference is the lookup of sparse features across huge embedding tables, which are usually partitioned across the aggregate RAM of many nodes. In state-of-the-art recommender systems, the distributed lookup is implemented via irregular all-to-all (alltoallv) communication, and often presents the main bottleneck. Today, most related work sees this operation as a given; in addition, every collective is synchronous in nature. In this work, we propose a novel bounded lag synchronous (BLS) version of the alltoallv operation. The bound can be a parameter allowing slower processes to lag behind entire iterations before the fastest processes block. In special applications such as inference-only DLRM, the accuracy of the application is fully preserved. We implement BLS alltoallv in a new PyTorch Distributed backend and evaluate it with a BLS version of the reference DLRM code. We show that for well balanced, homogeneous-access DLRM runs our BLS technique does not offer notable advantages. But for unbalanced runs, e.g. runs with strongly irregular embedding table accesses or with delays across different processes, our BLS technique improves both the latency and throughput of inference-only DLRM. In the best-case scenario, the proposed reduced synchronisation can mask the delays across processes altogether."}

Most existing approaches rely on deterministic embeddings or black-box predictive models, offering limited uncertainty quantification and little insight into what latent representations encode. We propose a probabilistic digital twin framework in which each user is modeled as a latent stochastic state that generates observed behavioral data. The digital twin is learned via amortized variational inference, enabling scalable posterior estimation while retaining a fully probabilistic interpretation. We instantiate this framework using a variational autoencoder (VAE) applied to a user-response dataset designed to capture stable aspects of user identity. Beyond standard reconstruction-based evaluation, we introduce a statistically grounded interpretation pipeline that links latent dimensions to observable behavioral patterns. By analyzing users at the extremes of each latent dimension and validating differences using nonparametric hypothesis tests and effect sizes, we demonstrate that specific dimensions correspond to interpretable traits such as opinion strength and decisiveness. Empirically, we find that user structure is predominantly continuous rather than discretely clustered, with weak but meaningful structure emerging along a small number of dominant latent axes. These results suggest that probabilistic digital twins can provide interpretable, uncertainty-aware representations that go beyond deterministic user embeddings."}

Under OAC-FL, every client modulates its intermediate parameters, such as gradient, onto the same set of orthogonal waveforms and simultaneously transmits the radio signal to the edge server. By exploiting the superposition property of multiple-access channels, the edge server can obtain an automatically aggregated global gradient from the received signal. However, the limited number of orthogonal waveforms available in practical systems is fundamentally mismatched with the high dimensionality of modern deep learning models. To address this issue, we propose Freshness Freshness-mAgnItude awaRe top-k (FAIR-k), an algorithm that selects, in each communication round, the most impactful subset of gradients to be updated over the air. In essence, FAIR-k combines the complementary strengths of the Round-Robin and Top-k algorithms, striking a delicate balance between timeliness (freshness of parameter updates) and importance (gradient magnitude). Leveraging tools from Markov analysis, we characterize the distribution of parameter staleness under FAIR-k. Building on this, we establish the convergence rate of OAC-FL with FAIR-k, which discloses the joint effect of data heterogeneity, channel noise, and parameter staleness on the training efficiency. Notably, as opposed to conventional analyses that assume a universal Lipschitz constant across all the clients, our framework adopts a finer-grained model of the data heterogeneity. The analysis demonstrates that since FAIR-k promotes fresh (and fair) parameter updates, it not only accelerates convergence but also enhances communication efficiency by enabling an extended period of local training without significantly affecting overall training efficiency."}

However, as organized crime groups are becoming more professional in real-world scenarios, fraudsters are employing more sophisticated camouflage strategies. Specifically, fraudsters disguise themselves by mimicking the behavioral data collected by platforms, ensuring that their key characteristics are consistent with those of benign users to a high degree, which we call Adaptive Camouflage. Consequently, this narrows the differences in behavioral traits between them and benign users within the platform's database, thereby making current GFD models lose efficiency. To address this problem, we propose a relation diffusion-based graph augmentation model Grad. In detail, Grad leverages a supervised graph contrastive learning module to enhance the fraud-benign difference and employs a guided relation diffusion generator to generate auxiliary homophilic relations from scratch. Based on these, weak fraudulent signals would be enhanced during the aggregation process, thus being obvious enough to be captured.

This paradigm has catalyzed entirely new product categories, such as LLM chatbots, while also raising concerns about data privacy and consumer choice. In this paper, we consider questions of data portability and user autonomy in the context of LLMs that \"reason\" using chain-of-thought (CoT) traces, computing intermediate text artifacts from user input before producing a final output. We first interpret recent data privacy and portability law to argue that these intermediate computations qualify as users' personal data. Then, building on the existing framework of Conscious Data Contribution, we show how communities who receive low utility from an available model can aggregate and distill their shared knowledge into an alternate model better aligned with their goals. We verify this approach empirically and investigate the effects of community diversity, reasoning granularity, and community size on distillation performance."}

Individual fairness has garnered traction in graph representation learning due to its practical importance in high-stakes Web areas such as user modeling, recommender systems, and search. However, existing methods assume the existence of predefined similarity information over all node pairs, an often unrealistic requirement that prevents their operationalization in practice. In this paper, we assume the similarity information is only available for a limited subset of node pairs and introduce FairExpand, a flexible framework that promotes individual fairness in this more realistic partial information scenario. FairExpand follows a two-step pipeline that alternates between refining node representations using a backbone model (e.g., a graph neural network) and gradually propagating similarity information, which allows fairness enforcement to effectively expand to the entire graph. Extensive experiments show that FairExpand consistently enhances individual fairness while preserving performance, making it a practical solution for enabling graph-based individual fairness in real-world applications with partial similarity information."}

Sufficient Conditions for Power Law Spectral Dynamics", "comment": null, "summary": "Empirical power--law scaling has been widely observed across modern deep learning systems, yet its theoretical origins and scope of validity remain incompletely understood. The Generalized Resolution--Shell Dynamics (GRSD) framework models learning as spectral energy transport across logarithmic resolution shells, providing a coarse--grained dynamical description of training. Within GRSD, power--law scaling corresponds to a particularly simple renormalized shell dynamics; however, such behavior is not automatic and requires additional structural properties of the learning process.\n  In this work, we identify a set of sufficient conditions under which the GRSD shell dynamics admits a renormalizable coarse--grained description. These conditions constrain the learning configuration at multiple levels, including boundedness of gradient propagation in the computation graph, weak functional incoherence at initialization, controlled Jacobian evolution along training, and log--shift invariance of renormalized shell couplings. We further show that power--law scaling does not follow from renormalizability alone, but instead arises as a rigidity consequence: once log--shift invariance is combined with the intrinsic time--rescaling covariance of gradient flow, the renormalized GRSD velocity field is forced into a power--law form."}

However, prevalent group-based algorithms such as GRPO require multi-rollout sampling for each prompt. While more efficient single-rollout variants have recently been explored in text-only settings, we find that they suffer from severe instability in multimodal contexts, often leading to training collapse. To address this training efficiency-stability trade-off, we introduce $\\textbf{MSSR}$ (Multimodal Stabilized Single-Rollout), a group-free RLVR framework that achieves both stable optimization and effective multimodal reasoning performance. MSSR achieves this via an entropy-based advantage-shaping mechanism that adaptively regularizes advantage magnitudes, preventing collapse and maintaining training stability. While such mechanisms have been used in group-based RLVR, we show that in the multimodal single-rollout setting they are not merely beneficial but essential for stability. In in-distribution evaluations, MSSR demonstrates superior training compute efficiency, achieving similar validation accuracy to the group-based baseline with half the training steps. When trained for the same number of steps, MSSR's performance surpasses the group-based baseline and shows consistent generalization improvements across five diverse reasoning-intensive benchmarks. Together, these results demonstrate that MSSR enables stable, compute-efficient, and effective RLVR for complex multimodal reasoning tasks."}

We attribute this effect to the weak alignment between policy performance and test loss, revealing substantial room for improvement through data selection. To this end, we propose a simple yet effective method, Stepwise Dual Ranking (SDR), which extracts a compact yet informative subset from large-scale offline behavioral datasets. SDR is build on two key principles: (1) stepwise clip, which prioritizes early-stage data; and (2) dual ranking, which selects samples with both high action-value rank and low state-density rank. Extensive experiments and ablation studies on D4RL benchmarks demonstrate that SDR significantly enhances data selection for offline behavioral data."}

Although LoRA is simple, its convergence is poorly understood due to the lack of Lipschitz smoothness, a key condition for classic convergence analyses. As a result, current theoretical results only consider asymptotic behavior or assume strong boundedness conditions which artificially enforce Lipschitz smoothness. In this work, we provide for the first time a non-asymptotic convergence analysis of the \\textit{original LoRA gradient descent} algorithm, which reflects widespread practice, without such assumptions. Our work relies on three key steps: i) reformulating the problem in terms of the outer product of the stacked adapter matrices, ii) a modified descent lemma for the ``Lipschitz-like\" reparametrized function, and iii) controlling the step size.

In this work, we propose AL GNN, a novel framework for continual graph learning that eliminates the need for backpropagation and replay buffers.

While stochastic gradient descent (SGD) and its variants have become the de facto standard for training deep networks, their success in these over-parameterized regimes often appears more empirical than principled. This thesis investigates this apparent paradox by tracing the evolution of optimization algorithms from classical first-order methods to modern higher-order techniques, revealing how principled algorithmic design can demystify the training process. Starting from first principles with SGD and adaptive gradient methods, the analysis progressively uncovers the limitations of these conventional approaches when confronted with anisotropy that is representative of real-world data. These breakdowns motivate the exploration of sophisticated alternatives rooted in curvature information: second-order approximation techniques, layer-wise preconditioning, adaptive learning rates, and more. Next, the interplay between these optimization algorithms and the broader neural network training toolkit, which includes prior and recent developments such as maximal update parametrization, learning rate schedules, and exponential moving averages, emerges as equally essential to empirical success. To bridge the gap between theoretical understanding and practical deployment, this paper offers practical prescriptions and implementation strategies for integrating these methods into modern deep learning workflows."}

However, existing expert pruning approaches conventionally rely on local importance metrics and often apply uniform layer-wise pruning, leveraging only partial evaluation signals and overlooking the heterogeneous contributions of experts across layers. To address these limitations, we propose an expert pruning approach based on the trajectory of activated experts across layers, which treats MoE as a weighted computation graph and casts expert selection as a global optimal path planning problem. Within this framework, we integrate complementary importance signals from reconstruction error, routing probabilities, and activation strength at the trajectory level, which naturally yields non-uniform expert retention across layers.

As tiles scale to maximize efficiency (e.g., F(6,3), F(8,3)), the condition numbers of standard integer based transforms explode, reaching kappa = 2 x 10^5 for F(8,3), rendering them unusable in FP16 or Int8. We introduce NOVA (Numerical Optimization of Vandermonde Arithmetic), a discovery framework that breaks the decades old convention of integer interpolation. Treating Winograd point selection as a continuous optimization problem, NOVA searches the manifold R^n-1 via Evolution Strategy, snaps candidates to simple rationals, and guarantees correctness via symbolic verification. This process uncovers a hidden landscape of stable, fractional configurations such as {+-5/6, +-7/6, +-3/5} that defy traditional vocabulary constraints. The impact is transformative: NOVA improves the conditioning of F(8,3) by 415x in 1D, which squares to a 172,484x improvement for 2D convolution. In real world FP16 ImageNet inference, where standard transforms collapse to random chance (e.g., 4.7 percent accuracy on VGG16), NOVA's points restore full accuracy (75 to 78 percent), recovering over 70 percentage points without retraining, calibration, or learned parameters.

Reliable deployment therefore requires robust OOD detection, yet this is particularly challenging for irregular 3D graphs that combine continuous geometry with categorical identities and are unordered by construction. Here, we present a probabilistic OOD detection framework for complex 3D graph data built on a diffusion model that learns a density of the training distribution in a fully unsupervised manner. A key ingredient we introduce is a unified continuous diffusion over both 3D coordinates and discrete features: categorical identities are embedded in a continuous space and trained with cross-entropy, while the corresponding diffusion score is obtained analytically via posterior-mean interpolation from predicted class probabilities. This yields a single self-consistent probability-flow ODE (PF-ODE) that produces per-sample log-likelihoods, providing a principled typicality score for distribution shift. We validate the approach on protein-ligand complexes and construct strict OOD datasets by withholding entire protein families from training. PF-ODE likelihoods identify held-out families as OOD and correlate strongly with prediction errors of an independent binding-affinity model (GEMS), enabling a priori reliability estimates on new complexes. Beyond scalar likelihoods, we show that multi-scale PF-ODE trajectory statistics - including path tortuosity, flow stiffness, and vector-field instability - provide complementary OOD information. Modeling the joint distribution of these trajectory features yields a practical, high-sensitivity detector that improves separation over likelihood-only baselines, offering a label-free OOD quantification workflow for geometric deep learning."}

When experience is represented as a linear trajectory in Euclidean space, the geodesic distance between temporal events grows linearly with time, forcing the required covering number to diverge. In fixed-dimensional hardware, this volume expansion inevitably forces trajectory overlap, manifesting as catastrophic interference. In this work, we propose a geometric resolution to this paradox based on Recursive Metric Contraction. We formalize abstraction not as symbolic grouping, but as a topological deformation: a quotient map that collapses the metric tensor within validated temporal neighborhoods, effectively driving the diameter of local sub-manifolds to zero. We substantiate our framework with four rigorous results. First, the Bounded Capacity Theorem establishes that recursive quotient maps allow the embedding of arbitrarily long trajectories into bounded representational volumes, trading linear metric growth for logarithmic topological depth. Second, the Topological Collapse Separability Theorem, derived via Urysohn's Lemma, proves that recursive quotienting renders non-linearly separable temporal sequences linearly separable in the limit, bypassing the need for infinite-dimensional kernel projections. Third, the Parity-Partitioned Stability Theorem solves the catastrophic forgetting problem by proving that if the state space is partitioned into orthogonal flow and scaffold manifolds, the metric deformations of active learning do not disturb the stability of stored memories. Our analysis reveals that tokens in neural architectures are physically realizable as singularities or wormholes, regions of extreme positive curvature that bridge distant points in the temporal manifold."}

Recent increases in drought severity, frequency, and duration underscore the need for effective monitoring and mitigation strategies. Predicting drought impacts rather than drought conditions alone offers opportunities to support early warning systems and proactive decision-making. This study applies machine learning techniques to link drought indices with historical drought impact records (2005:2024) to generate short-term impact forecasts. By addressing key conceptual and data-driven challenges regarding temporal scale and impact quantification, the study aims to improve the predictability of drought impacts at actionable lead times. The Drought Severity and Coverage Index (DSCI) and the Evaporative Stress Index (ESI) were combined with impact data from the Drought Impact Reporter (DIR) to model and forecast weekly drought impacts. Results indicate that Fire and Relief impacts were predicted with the highest accuracy, followed by Agriculture and Water, while forecasts for Plants and Society impacts showed greater variability. County and state level forecasts for New Mexico were produced using an eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) model that incorporated both DSCI and ESI. The model successfully generated forecasts up to eight weeks in advance using the preceding eight weeks of data for most impact categories. This work supports the development of an Ecological Drought Information Communication System (EcoDri) for New Mexico and demonstrates the potential for broader application in similar drought-prone regions. The findings can aid stakeholders, land managers, and decision-makers in developing and implementing more effective drought mitigation and adaptation strategies."}

While Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have seen increasing use to great effect in graph classification tasks, few studies explore their integration with interpretable graph theoretic features. This paper investigates the classification of synthetic graph families using a hybrid approach that combines GNNs with engineered graph-theoretic features. We generate a large and structurally diverse synthetic dataset comprising graphs from five representative generative families, Erdos-Renyi, Watts-Strogatz, Barab'asi-Albert, Holme-Kim, and Stochastic Block Model. These graphs range in size up to 1x10^4 nodes, containing up to 1.1x10^5 edges. A comprehensive range of node and graph level features is extracted for each graph and pruned using a Random Forest based feature selection pipeline. The features are integrated into six GNN architectures: GCN, GAT, GATv2, GIN, GraphSAGE and GTN. Each architecture is optimised for hyperparameter selection using Optuna. Finally, models were compared against a baseline Support Vector Machine (SVM) trained solely on the handcrafted features. Our evaluation demonstrates that GraphSAGE and GTN achieve the highest classification performance, with 98.5% accuracy, and strong class separation evidenced by t-SNE and UMAP visualisations. GCN and GIN also performed well, while GAT-based models lagged due to limitations in their ability to capture global structures. The SVM baseline confirmed the importance of the message passing functionality for performance gains and meaningful class separation."}

Evaluating the dynamics in such models is key to understanding their learned generative mechanisms. However, such evaluation is impeded by two major challenges: First, comparison of learned dynamics across models is difficult because there is no enforced equivalence of their coordinate systems. Second, identification of mechanistically important low-dimensional motifs (e.g., limit sets) is intractable in high-dimensional nonlinear models such as RNNs. Here, we propose a comprehensive framework to address these two issues, termed Diffeomorphic vector field alignment FOR learned Models (DFORM). DFORM learns a nonlinear coordinate transformation between the state spaces of two dynamical systems, which aligns their trajectories in a maximally one-to-one manner. In so doing, DFORM enables an assessment of whether two models exhibit topological equivalence, i.e., similar mechanisms despite differences in coordinate systems. A byproduct of this method is a means to locate dynamical motifs on low-dimensional manifolds embedded within higher-dimensional systems. We verified DFORM's ability to identify linear and nonlinear coordinate transformations using canonical topologically equivalent systems, RNNs, and systems related by nonlinear flows. DFORM was also shown to provide a quantification of similarity between topologically distinct systems. We then demonstrated that DFORM can locate important dynamical motifs including invariant manifolds and saddle limit sets within high-dimensional models. Finally, using a set of RNN models trained on human functional MRI (fMRI) recordings, we illustrated that DFORM can identify limit cycles from high-dimensional data-driven models, which agreed well with prior numerical analysis."}

Our systematic evaluation of five architectures reveals striking modality-dependent performance patterns: Hopfield networks achieve 97.68% accuracy on visual tasks but only 76.15% on auditory tasks (21.53 point gap), revealing severe modality-specific specialization, while SCL demonstrates more balanced cross-modal performance (96.72% visual, 82.16% audio, 14.56 point gap).

While neural surrogates promise a paradigm shift, the field currently suffers from an \"illusion of mastery\", as repeatedly emphasized in top-tier commentaries: existing evaluations overly rely on simplified, low-dimensional proxies, which fail to expose the models' inherent fragility in realistic regimes. To bridge this critical gap, we present REALM (REalistic AI Learning for Multiphysics), a rigorous benchmarking framework designed to test neural surrogates on challenging, application-driven reactive flows. REALM features 11 high-fidelity datasets spanning from canonical multiphysics problems to complex propulsion and fire safety scenarios, alongside a standardized end-to-end training and evaluation protocol that incorporates multiphysics-aware preprocessing and a robust rollout strategy. Using this framework, we systematically benchmark over a dozen representative surrogate model families, including spectral operators, convolutional models, Transformers, pointwise operators, and graph/mesh networks, and identify three robust trends: (i) a scaling barrier governed jointly by dimensionality, stiffness, and mesh irregularity, leading to rapidly growing rollout errors; (ii) performance primarily controlled by architectural inductive biases rather than parameter count; and (iii) a persistent gap between nominal accuracy metrics and physically trustworthy behavior, where models with high correlations still miss key transient structures and integral quantities. Taken together, REALM exposes the limits of current neural surrogates on realistic multiphysics flows and offers a rigorous testbed to drive the development of next-generation physics-aware architectures."}

In this work, we treat interactions as the fundamental units of such structure and investigate a largely unexplored question: how DNNs encode interactions under different levels of contextual complexity, and how these microscopic interaction patterns shape macroscopic representation capacity. To quantify this complexity, we use multi-order interactions [57], where each order reflects the amount of contextual information required to evaluate the joint interaction utility of a variable pair. This formulation enables a stratified analysis of cooperative patterns learned by DNNs. Building on this formulation, we develop a comprehensive study of interaction structure in DNNs. (i) We empirically discover a universal interaction bottleneck: across architectures and tasks, DNNs easily learn low-order and high-order interactions but consistently under-represent mid-order ones. (ii) We theoretically explain this bottleneck by proving that mid-order interactions incur the highest contextual variability, yielding large gradient variance and making them intrinsically difficult to learn. (iii) We further modulate the bottleneck by introducing losses that steer models toward emphasizing interactions of selected orders. Finally, we connect microscopic interaction structures with macroscopic representational behavior: low-order-emphasized models exhibit stronger generalization and robustness, whereas high-order-emphasized models demonstrate greater structural modeling and fitting capability. Together, these results uncover an inherent representational bias in modern DNNs and establish interaction order as a powerful lens for interpreting and guiding deep representations."}

Our analysis reveals a fundamental paradigm paradox: the more deterministic and structured the time series, the more severe the bias by point-wise loss function. We derive the first closed-form quantification for the non-deterministic EOB across linear and non-linear systems, and prove EOB is an intrinsic data property, governed exclusively by sequence length and our proposed Structural Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SSNR).

We present a concrete solution that simultaneously achieves both principles via DFT or DWT.

This disentanglement is achieved by enforcing analogical consistency in the embedding space to ensure the semantic transformation of adding an attribute (e.g., a length constraint) remains invariant across different problem contexts. This enables our model to reuse invariant semantics across trained variants and construct representations for unseen combinations.

In this work, we study how the choice of pretraining data distribution steers a shallow transformer toward one behavior or the other. Focusing on a minimal trigger-output prediction task -- copying the token immediately following a special trigger upon its second occurrence -- we present a rigorous analysis of gradient-based training of a single-layer transformer. In both the infinite and finite sample regimes, we prove a transition in the learned mechanism: if input sequences exhibit sufficient diversity, measured by a low ``max-sum'' ratio of trigger-to-trigger distances, the trained model implements an induction head and generalizes to unseen contexts; by contrast, when this ratio is large, the model resorts to a positional shortcut and fails to generalize out-of-distribution (OOD). We also reveal a trade-off between the pretraining context length and OOD generalization, and derive the optimal pretraining distribution that minimizes computational cost per sample. Finally, we validate our theoretical predictions with controlled synthetic experiments, demonstrating that broadening context distributions robustly induces induction heads and enables OOD generalization. Our results shed light on the algorithmic biases of pretrained transformers and offer conceptual guidelines for data-driven control of their learned behaviors."}

Existing methods primarily address the stability-plasticity dilemma through mechanisms where past knowledge influences optimization but rarely affects the agent's behavior directly, which may hinder effective knowledge reuse and efficient learning. In contrast, we propose demonstration-guided continual reinforcement learning (DGCRL), which stores prior knowledge in an external, self-evolving demonstration repository that directly guides RL exploration and adaptation. For each task, the agent dynamically selects the most relevant demonstration and follows a curriculum-based strategy to accelerate learning, gradually shifting from demonstration-guided exploration to fully self-exploration. Extensive experiments on 2D navigation and MuJoCo locomotion tasks demonstrate its superior average performance, enhanced knowledge transfer, mitigation of forgetting, and training efficiency.

On this basis, a multi-scale graph semantic aggregation module is introduced to achieve semantic consistency modeling of scheduling features through local adjacency semantic integration and global topology alignment, thereby strengthening the model's capability to capture abnormal features in complex scenarios such as multi-task concurrency, resource competition, and stage transitions. Experiments are conducted on a real scheduling dataset with multiple scheduling disturbance paths set to simulate different types of anomalies, including structural shifts, resource changes, and task delays. The proposed model demonstrates significant performance advantages across multiple metrics, showing a sensitive response to structural disturbances and semantic shifts.

To overcome this limitation, recent works adopt diffusion models to produce new risky samples beyond the coverage of existing datasets. However, these methods struggle in the conformity between generated samples and expected categories, which could introduce label noise and severely limit their effectiveness in applications. To address this issue, we propose RiskyDiff that incorporates the embeddings of both texts and images as implicit constraints of category conformity. We also design a conformity score to further explicitly strengthen the category conformity, as well as introduce the mechanisms of embedding screening and risky gradient guidance to boost the risk of generated samples. Extensive experiments reveal that RiskyDiff greatly outperforms existing methods in terms of the degree of risk, generation quality, and conformity with conditioned categories.

Nevertheless, existing interference prediction approaches remain limited in several respects, which may restrict their usefulness for scheduling. First, they are often coarse-grained, which ignores runtime co-location dynamics and thus restricts their accuracy in interference prediction. Second, they tend to use a static prediction model, which may not effectively cope with different workload characteristics. To this end, we evaluate the potential limitations of existing interference prediction approaches and outline our ongoing work toward achieving efficient ML inference scheduling."}

However, recent work has largely overlooked the potential impact of post-treatment variables on the outcome. This oversight prevents existing methods from fully capturing outcome variability, resulting in increased variance in counterfactual predictions. This paper introduces Pseudo-outcome Imputation with Post-treatment Variables for Counterfactual Regression (PIPCFR), a novel approach that incorporates post-treatment variables to improve pseudo-outcome imputation. We analyze the challenges inherent in utilizing post-treatment variables and establish a novel theoretical bound for ITE risk that explicitly connects post-treatment variables to ITE estimation accuracy. Unlike existing methods that ignore these variables or impose restrictive assumptions, PIPCFR learns effective representations that preserve informative components while mitigating bias. Empirical evaluations on both real-world and simulated datasets demonstrate that PIPCFR achieves significantly lower ITE errors compared to existing methods."}

These parametric models, termed GMM-QFs, possess substantial representational capacity, as they are shown to be universal approximators over a broad class of functions. They are further embedded within Bellman residuals, where their learnable parameters -- a fixed number of mixing weights, together with Gaussian mean vectors and covariance matrices -- are inferred from data via optimization on a Riemannian manifold. This geometric perspective on the parameter space naturally incorporates Riemannian optimization into the policy-evaluation step of standard policy-iteration frameworks. Rigorous theoretical results are established, and supporting numerical tests show that, even without access to experience data, GMM-QFs deliver competitive performance and, in some cases, outperform state-of-the-art approaches across a range of benchmark RL tasks, all while maintaining a significantly smaller computational footprint than deep-learning methods that rely on experience data."}

Existing semi-supervised methods typically treat data as purely numerical and} in a deterministic manner, thereby neglecting the heterogeneity and uncertainty inherent in complex, real-world datasets. This paper introduces a label-informed outlier detection method for heterogeneous data based on Granular Computing and Fuzzy Sets, namely Granule Density-based Outlier Factor (GDOF). Specifically, GDOF first employs label-informed fuzzy granulation to effectively represent various data types and develops granule density for precise density estimation. Subsequently, granule densities from individual attributes are integrated for outlier scoring by assessing attribute relevance with a limited number of labeled outliers. Experimental results on various real-world datasets show that GDOF stands out in detecting outliers in heterogeneous data with a minimal number of labeled outliers. The integration of Fuzzy Sets and Granular Computing in GDOF offers a practical framework for outlier detection in complex and diverse data types.

However, current CRPS ensemble approaches vary in their training strategies and noise injection mechanisms, with most injecting noise globally throughout the network via conditional normalization. This structure increases training expense and limits the physical interpretability of the stochastic perturbations. We introduce Stochastic Decomposition Layers (SDL) for converting deterministic machine learning weather models into probabilistic ensemble systems. Adapted from StyleGAN's hierarchical noise injection, SDL applies learned perturbations at three decoder scales through latent-driven modulation, per-pixel noise, and channel scaling. When applied to WXFormer via transfer learning, SDL requires less than 2\\% of the computational cost needed to train the baseline model. Each ensemble member is generated from a compact latent tensor (5 MB), enabling perfect reproducibility and post-inference spread adjustment through latent rescaling. Evaluation on 2022 ERA5 reanalysis shows ensembles with spread-skill ratios approaching unity and rank histograms that progressively flatten toward uniformity through medium-range forecasts, achieving calibration competitive with operational IFS-ENS. Multi-scale experiments reveal hierarchical uncertainty: coarse layers modulate synoptic patterns while fine layers control mesoscale variability. The explicit latent parameterization provides interpretable uncertainty quantification for operational forecasting and climate applications."}

We systematically investigate the interplay between quantization precision (FP16, INT8, INT4) and replay buffer strategies in large language models, revealing unexpected dynamics. While FP16 achieves superior initial task performance (74.44% on NLU), we observe a striking inversion on subsequent tasks: quantized models outperform FP16 by 8-15% on final task forward accuracy, with INT4 achieving nearly double FP16's performance on Code generation (40% vs 20%). Critically, even minimal replay buffers (0.1%) dramatically improve retention - increasing NLU retention after Math training from 45% to 65% across all precision levels - with INT8 consistently achieving the optimal balance between learning plasticity and knowledge retention. We hypothesize that quantization-induced noise acts as implicit regularization, preventing the overfitting to new task gradients that plagues high-precision models. These findings challenge the conventional wisdom that higher precision is always preferable, suggesting instead that INT8 quantization offers both computational efficiency and superior continual learning dynamics. Our results provide practical guidelines for deploying compressed models in continual learning scenarios: small replay buffers (1-2%) suffice for NLU tasks, while Math and Code benefit from moderate buffers (5-10%), with quantized models requiring less replay than FP16 to achieve comparable retention.

We overcome these limitations by proposing an online DR-RL algorithm with general function approximation that learns an optimal robust policy purely through interaction with the environment, without requiring prior models or offline data, enabling deployment in high-dimensional tasks.

We introduce a direct, first-principles framework for constructing discrete-time SSMs that is both flexible and modular. Our approach is based on a novel lag operator, which geometrically derives the discrete-time recurrence by measuring how the system's basis functions \"slide\" and change from one timestep to the next. The resulting state matrices are computed via a single inner product involving this operator, offering a modular design space for creating novel SSMs by flexibly combining different basis functions and time-warping schemes. To validate our approach, we demonstrate that a specific instance exactly recovers the recurrence of the influential HiPPO model.

First, a few labeled outliers are leveraged to construct label-informed fuzzy similarity relations. Next, the consistency of the fuzzy decision system is introduced to evaluate attributes' contributions to knowledge classification. Subsequently, we define the outlier factor based on the fuzzy similarity class and predict outliers by integrating the classification consistency and the outlier factor.

Most existing methods use Gaussian processes (GP) as the surrogate model for approximating the black-box objective function, it is well-known that it can fail in high-dimensional space (e.g., dimension over 500). We argue that the reliance of GP on precise numerical fitting is fundamentally ill-suited in high-dimensional space, where it leads to prohibitive computational complexity. In order to address this, we propose a simple order-preserving Bayesian optimization (OPBO) method, where the surrogate model preserves the order, instead of the value, of the black-box objective function. Then we can use a simple but effective OP neural network (NN) to replace GP as the surrogate model. Moreover, instead of searching for the best solution from the acquisition model, we select good-enough solutions in the ordinal set to reduce computational cost.

By representing each anatomically parcellated brain region as a visual token and encoding SNP profiles as structured text, the framework enables cross-modal attention that links regional atrophy patterns to underlying genetic factors. Applied to the ADNI cohort, R-GenIMA achieves state-of-the-art performance in four-way classification across normal cognition (NC), subjective memory concerns (SMC), mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and AD. Beyond predictive accuracy, the model yields biologically meaningful explanations by identifying stage-specific brain regions and gene signatures, as well as coherent ROI-Gene association patterns across the disease continuum. Attention-based attribution revealed genes consistently enriched for established GWAS-supported AD risk loci, including APOE, BIN1, CLU, and RBFOX1. Stage-resolved neuroanatomical signatures identified shared vulnerability hubs across disease stages alongside stage-specific patterns: striatal involvement in subjective decline, frontotemporal engagement during prodromal impairment, and consolidated multimodal network disruption in AD.

We study the training dynamics of neural networks under DP by comparing Gradient Descent (GD), and Adam to their privacy-preserving variants. Prior work shows that these optimizers exhibit distinct stability dynamics: full-batch methods train at the Edge of Stability (EoS), while mini-batch and adaptive methods exhibit analogous edge-of-stability behavior. At these regimes, the training loss and the sharpness--the maximum eigenvalue of the training loss Hessian--exhibit certain characteristic behavior. In DP training, per-example gradient clipping and Gaussian noise modify the update rule, and it is unclear whether these stability patterns persist. We analyze how clipping and noise change sharpness and loss evolution and show that while DP generally reduces the sharpness and can prevent optimizers from fully reaching the classical stability thresholds, patterns from EoS and analogous adaptive methods stability regimes persist, with the largest learning rates and largest privacy budgets approaching, and sometimes exceeding, these thresholds. These findings highlight the unpredictability introduced by DP in neural network optimization."}

In the original framework, each ML-generated candidate model is embedded in a CFD solver and evaluated against reference data, requiring hundreds to thousands of high-fidelity simulations and resulting in prohibitive computational cost for complex flows. To overcome this limitation, we propose an extended framework that integrates surrogate modeling into symbolic CFD-driven training in real time to reduce training cost. The surrogate model learns to approximate the errors of ML-generated models based on previous CFD evaluations and is continuously refined during training. Newly generated models are first assessed using the surrogate, and only those predicted to yield small errors or high uncertainty are subsequently evaluated with full CFD simulations. Discrete expressions generated by symbolic regression are mapped into a continuous space using averaged input-symbol values as inputs to a probabilistic surrogate model. To support multi-objective model training, particularly when fixed weighting of competing quantities is challenging, the surrogate is extended to a multi-output formulation by generalizing the kernel to a matrix form, providing one mean and variance prediction per training objective. Selection metrics based on these probabilistic outputs are used to identify an optimal training setup. The proposed surrogate-augmented CFD-driven training framework is demonstrated across a range of statistically one- and two-dimensional flows, including both single- and multi-expression model optimization. In all cases, the framework substantially reduces training cost while maintaining predictive accuracy comparable to that of the original CFD-driven approach."}

This paper aims to develop a time series forecast model to predict the zone air temperature in a building located in America on a 2-week horizon. The findings could be further improved to support intelligent control and operation of HVAC systems (i.e. demand flexibility) and could also be used as hybrid building energy modeling."}

Human feedback is costly and time-consuming to obtain, which creates demand for data-efficient query selection methods. This work presents a novel approach that leverages optimal experimental design to ask humans the most informative preference queries, from which we can elucidate the latent reward function modeling user preferences efficiently. We formulate the problem of preference query selection as the one that maximizes the information about the underlying latent preference model. We show that this problem has a convex optimization formulation, and introduce a statistically and computationally efficient algorithm ED-PBRL that is supported by theoretical guarantees and can efficiently construct structured queries such as images or text. We empirically present the proposed framework by personalizing a text-to-image generative model to user-specific styles, showing that it requires less preference queries compared to random query selection."}

Traditional detection methods that rely solely on high-confidence identity links suffer from limited coverage, while approaches using all available linkages often result in fragmented graphs with reduced clustering effectiveness. In this paper, we propose a novel graph-based fraud detection framework that addresses the challenge of large-scale heterogeneous graph clustering through a principled link transformation approach. Our method distinguishes between \\emph{hard links} (high-confidence identity relationships such as phone numbers, credit cards, and national IDs) and \\emph{soft links} (behavioral associations including device fingerprints, cookies, and IP addresses). We introduce a graph transformation technique that first identifies connected components via hard links, merges them into super-nodes, and then reconstructs a weighted soft-link graph amenable to efficient embedding and clustering. The transformed graph is processed using LINE (Large-scale Information Network Embedding) for representation learning, followed by HDBSCAN (Hierarchical Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise) for density-based cluster discovery. Experiments on a real-world payment platform dataset demonstrate that our approach achieves significant graph size reduction (from 25 million to 7.7 million nodes), doubles the detection coverage compared to hard-link-only baselines, and maintains high precision across identified fraud clusters. Our framework provides a scalable and practical solution for industrial-scale fraud detection systems."}

The framework addresses two complementary clinical questions: a probabilistic trajectory network predicts individualized cognitive decline with calibrated uncertainty bounds achieving near-nominal coverage, enabling honest prognostic communication; and a deep survival model estimates time to conversion from mild cognitive impairment to dementia. Using data from over 3,000 participants across 43 Alzheimer's Disease Research Centers in the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center database, PROGRESS substantially outperforms Cox proportional hazards, Random Survival Forests, and gradient boosting methods for survival prediction. Risk stratification identifies patient groups with seven-fold differences in conversion rates, enabling clinically meaningful treatment prioritization. Leave-one-center-out validation demonstrates robust generalizability, with survival discrimination remaining strong across held-out sites despite heterogeneous measurement conditions spanning four decades of assay technologies. By combining superior survival prediction with trustworthy trajectory uncertainty quantification, PROGRESS bridges the gap between biomarker measurement and personalized clinical decision-making."}

Yang"], "title": "Timely Parameter Updating in Over-the-Air Federated Learning", "comment": null, "summary": "Incorporating over-the-air computations (OAC) into the model training process of federated learning (FL) is an effective approach to alleviating the communication bottleneck in FL systems. Under OAC-FL, every client modulates its intermediate parameters, such as gradient, onto the same set of orthogonal waveforms and simultaneously transmits the radio signal to the edge server. By exploiting the superposition property of multiple-access channels, the edge server can obtain an automatically aggregated global gradient from the received signal. However, the limited number of orthogonal waveforms available in practical systems is fundamentally mismatched with the high dimensionality of modern deep learning models. To address this issue, we propose Freshness Freshness-mAgnItude awaRe top-k (FAIR-k), an algorithm that selects, in each communication round, the most impactful subset of gradients to be updated over the air. In essence, FAIR-k combines the complementary strengths of the Round-Robin and Top-k algorithms, striking a delicate balance between timeliness (freshness of parameter updates) and importance (gradient magnitude). Leveraging tools from Markov analysis, we characterize the distribution of parameter staleness under FAIR-k. Building on this, we establish the convergence rate of OAC-FL with FAIR-k, which discloses the joint effect of data heterogeneity, channel noise, and parameter staleness on the training efficiency. Notably, as opposed to conventional analyses that assume a universal Lipschitz constant across all the clients, our framework adopts a finer-grained model of the data heterogeneity. The analysis demonstrates that since FAIR-k promotes fresh (and fair) parameter updates, it not only accelerates convergence but also enhances communication efficiency by enabling an extended period of local training without significantly affecting overall training efficiency."}

However, existing methods struggle to address small-sample scenarios caused by cold start, load distortion, multi-source data fragmentation, and distribution shifts in green data centers. We introduce HyperLoad, a cross-modality framework that exploits pre-trained large language models (LLMs) to overcome data scarcity. In the Cross-Modality Knowledge Alignment phase, textual priors and time-series data are mapped to a common latent space, maximizing the utility of prior knowledge. In the Multi-Scale Feature Modeling phase, domain-aligned priors are injected through adaptive prefix-tuning, enabling rapid scenario adaptation, while an Enhanced Global Interaction Attention mechanism captures cross-device temporal dependencies.

Methods: Our CA architecture first processes the iEEG signal using state-of-the-art models applied to each single channel independently. The resulting features are then fused using a vector-symbolic algorithm which reconstructs the spatial relationship using a trainable scalar per channel. Finally, the fused features are accumulated in a long-term memory of up to 2 minutes to perform the classification. Each CA-model can then be pre-trained on a large corpus of iEEG recordings from multiple heterogeneous subjects. The pre-trained model is personalized to each subject via a quick fine-tuning routine, which uses equal or lower amounts of data compared to existing state-of-the-art models, but requiring only 1/5 of the time. Results: We evaluate our CA-models on a seizure detection task both on a short-term (~20 hours) and a long-term (~2500 hours) dataset. In particular, our CA-EEGWaveNet is trained on a single seizure of the tested subject, while the baseline EEGWaveNet is trained on all but one. Even in this challenging scenario, our CA-EEGWaveNet surpasses the baseline in median F1-score (0.78 vs 0.76). Similarly, CA-EEGNet based on EEGNet, also surpasses its baseline in median F1-score (0.79 vs 0.74). Conclusion and significance: Our CA-model addresses two issues: first, it is channel-adaptive and can therefore be trained across heterogeneous subjects without loss of performance; second, it increases the effective temporal context size to a clinically-relevant length. Therefore, our model is a drop-in replacement for existing models, bringing better characteristics and performance across the board."}

Nevertheless, the existing industrial hybrid modeling methods still face two main limitations. First, current research has mainly focused on applying a single machine learning method to one specific task, failing to develop a comprehensive machine learning architecture suitable for modeling tasks, which limits their ability to effectively represent complex industrial scenarios. Second, industrial datasets often contain underlying associations (e.g., monotonicity or periodicity) that are not adequately exploited by current research, which can degrade model's predictive performance. To address these limitations, this paper proposes the Recurrent Perceptron-based Channel Attention Transformer Encoder (RP-CATE), with three distinctive characteristics: 1: We developed a novel architecture by replacing the self-attention mechanism with channel attention and incorporating our proposed Recurrent Perceptron (RP) Module into Transformer, achieving enhanced effectiveness for industrial modeling tasks compared to the original Transformer. 2: We proposed a new data type called Pseudo-Image Data (PID) tailored for channel attention requirements and developed a cyclic sliding window method for generating PID. 3: We introduced the concept of Pseudo-Sequential Data (PSD) and a method for converting industrial datasets into PSD, which enables the RP Module to capture the underlying associations within industrial dataset more effectively. An experiment aimed at hybrid modeling in chemical engineering was conducted by using RP-CATE and the experimental results demonstrate that RP-CATE achieves the best performance compared to other baseline models."}

A key challenge experienced in these more realistic domains is highly non-Markovian dependencies with respect to the agent's observations, which are less common in small controlled domains. The predominant approach for dealing with this in the literature is to stack together a window of the most recent observations (Frame Stacking), but this window size must grow with the degree of non-Markovian dependencies, which results in prohibitive computational and memory requirements for both action inference and learning. In this paper, we are motivated by the insight that in many environments that are highly non-Markovian with respect to time, the environment only causally depends on a relatively small number of observations over that time-scale. A natural direction would then be to consider meta-algorithms that maintain relatively small adaptive stacks of memories such that it is possible to express highly non-Markovian dependencies with respect to time while considering fewer observations at each step and thus experience substantial savings in both compute and memory requirements. Hence, we propose a meta-algorithm (Adaptive Stacking) for achieving exactly that with convergence guarantees and quantify the reduced computation and memory constraints for MLP, LSTM, and Transformer-based agents. Our experiments utilize popular memory tasks, which give us control over the degree of non-Markovian dependencies. This allows us to demonstrate that an appropriate meta-algorithm can learn the removal of memories not predictive of future rewards without excessive removal of important experiences.

This neglects that the quantum and classical branches constitute distinct computational modalities and limits reliable performance on complex, high dimensional tabular and semi structured data, including remote sensing, environmental monitoring, and medical diagnostics. We present a multimodal formulation of hybrid learning and propose a cross attention mid fusion architecture in which a classical representation queries quantum derived feature tokens through an attention block with residual connectivity. The quantum branch is kept within practical NISQ budgets and uses up to nine qubits. We evaluate on Wine, Breast Cancer, Forest CoverType, FashionMNIST, and SteelPlatesFaults, comparing a quantum only model, a classical baseline, residual hybrid models, and the proposed mid fusion model under a consistent protocol. Pure quantum and standard hybrid designs underperform due to measurement induced information loss, while cross attention mid fusion is consistently competitive and improves performance on the more complex datasets in most cases. These findings suggest that quantum derived information becomes most valuable when integrated through principled multimodal fusion rather than used in isolation or loosely appended to classical features."}

Fixed-precision quantization struggles to handle outlier channels in the key cache, while current mixed-precision strategies fail to accurately identify components requiring high-precision representation. We find that an effective low-bit KV cache quantization strategy must consider two factors: a key channel's intrinsic quantization difficulty and its relevance to the query.

This raises a basic question: is there a general, modality-agnostic way to quantify how acquisition itself preserves or destroys the information that downstream learners could use? Here we propose an acquisition-level scalar $ΔS_{\\mathcal B}$ based on instrument-resolved phase space. Unlike pixelwise distortion or purely spectral errors that often saturate under aggressive undersampling, $ΔS_{\\mathcal B}$ directly quantifies how acquisition mixes or removes joint space--frequency structure at the instrument scale. We show theoretically that \\(ΔS_{\\mathcal B}\\) correctly identifies the phase-space coherence of periodic sampling as the physical source of aliasing, recovering classical sampling-theorem consequences. Empirically, across masked image classification, accelerated MRI, and massive MIMO (including over-the-air measurements), $|ΔS_{\\mathcal B}|$ consistently ranks sampling geometries and predicts downstream reconstruction/recognition difficulty \\emph{without training}. In particular, minimizing $|ΔS_{\\mathcal B}|$ enables zero-training selection of variable-density MRI mask parameters that matches designs tuned by conventional pre-reconstruction criteria.

Nevertheless, traditional GAN fail to account for the mapping relationship between labels and features, which limits further performance improvement. Although some studies have proposed solutions, none have considered both performance and efficiency simultaneously. To address these problems, this paper proposes the multi-task learning-based regression GAN framework that integrates regression information into both the discriminator and generator, and implements a shallow sharing mechanism between the discriminator and regressor. This approach significantly enhances the quality of generated samples while improving the algorithm's operational efficiency. Moreover, considering the importance of training samples and generated samples, a dual data evaluation strategy is designed to make GAN generate more diverse samples, thereby increasing the generalization of subsequent modeling.

Traditional data-driven methods require extensive labeled fault data, which is often impractical to obtain, while model-based approaches suffer from parameter uncertainties. This paper proposes a digital twin (DT)-driven zero-shot fault diagnosis framework utilizing fluid-borne noise (FBN) signals. The framework calibrates a high-fidelity DT model using only healthy-state data, generates synthetic fault signals for training deep learning classifiers, and employs a physics-informed neural network (PINN) as a virtual sensor for flow ripple estimation. Gradient-weighted class activation mapping (Grad-CAM) is integrated to visualize the decision-making process of neural networks, revealing that large kernels matching the subsequence length in time-domain inputs and small kernels in time-frequency domain inputs enable higher diagnostic accuracy by focusing on physically meaningful features. Experimental validations demonstrate that training on signals from the calibrated DT model yields diagnostic accuracies exceeding 95\\% on real-world benchmarks, while uncalibrated models result in significantly lower performance, highlighting the framework's effectiveness in data-scarce scenarios."}

As sensor networks grow in scale and complexity, identifying the most informative sensors becomes essential to reduce deployment costs without compromising monitoring quality. While Graph Signal Processing (GSP) has shown promise by leveraging spatial correlations among sensor nodes, conventional approaches often overlook the temporal dynamics of structural behavior. To overcome this limitation, we propose Time-Vertex Machine Learning (TVML), a novel framework that integrates GSP, time-domain analysis, and machine learning to enable interpretable and efficient sensor placement by identifying representative nodes that minimize redundancy while preserving critical information. We evaluate the proposed approach on two bridge datasets for damage detection and time-varying graph signal reconstruction tasks. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in enhancing SHM systems by providing a robust, adaptive, and efficient solution for sensor placement."}

Model merging aims to merge the distinct capabilities of these specialised models into a unified model, requiring minimal or even no additional training. A core objective of model merging is to ensure the merged model retains the behavioural characteristics of the specialised models, typically achieved through feature alignment. We identify that features consist of two critical components: direction and magnitude. Prior research has predominantly focused on directional alignment, while the influence of magnitude remains largely neglected, despite its pronounced vulnerability to perturbations introduced by common merging operations (e.g., parameter fusion and sparsification). Such perturbations to magnitude inevitably lead to feature deviations in the merged model from the specialised models, resulting in subsequent performance degradation. To address this, we propose MAGnItude Calibration (MAGIC), a plug-and-play framework that rectifies layer-wise magnitudes in feature and weight spaces, with three variants. Specifically, our Feature Space Calibration (FSC) realigns the merged model's features using a small set of unlabelled data, while Weight Space Calibration (WSC) extends this calibration to the weight space without requiring additional data. Combining these yields Dual Space Calibration (DSC). Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that MAGIC consistently boosts performance across diverse Computer Vision tasks (+4.3% on eight datasets) and NLP tasks (+8.0% on Llama) without additional training.

These functions preserve some key properties of sinusoidal ones, while they depart from them in fundamental ways. Some tentative experiments are reported, where the original sinusoidal version is substantially outperformed.

Existing methods often lack adaptability to dynamic conditions and fail to optimize decision making in real time. To address these challenges, we propose a hybrid reinforcement learning framework integrating Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) for enhanced spoilage prediction. This hybrid architecture captures temporal dependencies within sensor data, enabling robust and adaptive decision making. In alignment with interpretable artificial intelligence principles, a rule-based classifier environment is employed to provide transparent ground truth labeling of spoilage levels based on domain-specific thresholds. This structured design allows the agent to operate within clearly defined semantic boundaries, supporting traceable and interpretable decisions. Model behavior is monitored using interpretability-driven metrics, including spoilage accuracy, reward-to-step ratio, loss reduction rate, and exploration decay. These metrics provide both quantitative performance evaluation and insights into learning dynamics. A class-wise spoilage distribution visualization is used to analyze the agents decision profile and policy behavior. Extensive evaluations on simulated and real-time hardware data demonstrate that the LSTM and RNN based agent outperforms alternative reinforcement learning approaches in prediction accuracy and decision efficiency while maintaining interpretability. The results highlight the potential of hybrid deep reinforcement learning with integrated interpretability for scalable IoT-based food monitoring systems."}

Classical Data-Shapley answers in principle, but its O(n!) complexity and point-wise perspective are ill-suited to modern scales.

HCDV collapses the factorial burden to O(T sum_{l} K_{l}) = O(T K_max log n), rewards examples that sharpen decision boundaries, and regularizes outliers through curvature-based smoothness. We prove that HCDV approximately satisfies the four Shapley axioms with surplus loss O(eta log n), enjoys sub-Gaussian coalition deviation tilde O(1/sqrt{T}), and incurs at most k epsilon_infty regret for top-k selection. Experiments on four benchmarks--tabular, vision, streaming, and a 45M-sample CTR task--plus the OpenDataVal suite show that HCDV lifts accuracy by up to +5 pp, slashes valuation time by up to 100x, and directly supports tasks such as augmentation filtering, low-latency streaming updates, and fair marketplace payouts."}

Distinct from Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) with fixed node activations and Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) featuring learnable edge activations, SNs utilize shared, learnable splines (monotonic and general) within structured blocks incorporating explicit shift parameters and mixing weights. Our approach directly realizes Sprecher's specific 1965 sum of shifted splines formula in its single-layer variant and extends it to deeper, multi-layer compositions. We further enhance the architecture with optional lateral mixing connections that enable intra-block communication between output dimensions, providing a parameter-efficient alternative to full attention mechanisms. Beyond parameter efficiency with $O(LN + LG)$ scaling (where $G$ is the knot count of the shared splines) versus MLPs' $O(LN^2)$, SNs admit a sequential evaluation strategy that reduces peak forward-intermediate memory from $O(N^2)$ to $O(N)$ (treating batch size as constant), making much wider architectures feasible under memory constraints. We demonstrate empirically that composing these blocks into deep networks leads to highly parameter and memory-efficient models, discuss theoretical motivations, and compare SNs with related architectures (MLPs, KANs, and networks with learnable node activations)."}

The dataset exhibits realistic challenges including cross-modal inconsistency and long-tailed class distributions shaped by Indonesian cultural communication norms.

We propose using human brain activity not as a training signal but as a coordinate system for reading and steering LLM states. Using the SMN4Lang MEG dataset, we construct a word-level brain atlas of phase-locking value (PLV) patterns and extract latent axes via ICA. We validate axes with independent lexica and NER-based labels (POS/log-frequency used as sanity checks), then train lightweight adapters that map LLM hidden states to these brain axes without fine-tuning the LLM. Steering along the resulting brain-derived directions yields a robust lexical (frequency-linked) axis in a mid TinyLlama layer, surviving perplexity-matched controls, and a brain-vs-text probe comparison shows larger log-frequency shifts (relative to the text probe) with lower perplexity for the brain axis. A function/content axis (axis 13) shows consistent steering in TinyLlama, Qwen2-0.5B, and GPT-2, with PPL-matched text-level corroboration. Layer-4 effects in TinyLlama are large but inconsistent, so we treat them as secondary (Appendix). Axis structure is stable when the atlas is rebuilt without GPT embedding-change features or with word2vec embeddings (|r|=0.64-0.95 across matched axes), reducing circularity concerns. Exploratory fMRI anchoring suggests potential alignment for embedding change and log frequency, but effects are sensitive to hemodynamic modeling assumptions and are treated as population-level evidence only. These results support a new interface: neurophysiology-grounded axes provide interpretable and controllable handles for LLM behavior."}

In physics, conservation laws of Hamiltonian systems such as symplecticity guarantee long-term stability, and recent work has begun to hard-wire such constraints into learning models at the loss or output level. Here we ask a different question: what would it mean for the representation itself to obey a symplectic conservation law in the sense of Hamiltonian mechanics?\n  We express this symplectic constraint through Legendre duality: the pairing between primal and dual parameters, which becomes the structure that the representation must preserve. We formalize Legendre dynamics as stochastic processes whose trajectories remain on Legendre graphs, so that the evolving primal-dual parameters stay Legendre dual. We show that this class includes linear time-invariant Gaussian process regression and Ornstein-Uhlenbeck dynamics.\n  Geometrically, we prove that the maps that preserve all Legendre graphs are exactly symplectomorphisms of cotangent bundles of the form \"cotangent lift of a base diffeomorphism followed by an exact fibre translation\". Dynamically, this characterization leads to the design of a Symplectic Reservoir (SR), a reservoir-computing architecture that is a special case of recurrent neural network and whose recurrent core is generated by Hamiltonian systems that are at most linear in the momentum.\n  Our main theorem shows that every SR update has this normal form and therefore transports Legendre graphs to Legendre graphs, preserving Legendre duality at each time step. Overall, SR implements a geometrically constrained, Legendre-preserving representation map, injecting symplectic geometry and Hamiltonian mechanics directly at the representational level."}

We ask a basic question: when is such a dynamical system learnable from observations alone? This paper proposes a research program for understanding learnability in dynamical systems through the lens of next-token prediction. We argue that learnability in dynamical systems should be studied as a finite-sample question, and be based on the properties of the underlying dynamics rather than the statistical properties of the resulting sequence. To this end, we give a formulation of learnability for stochastic processes induced by dynamical systems, focusing on guarantees that hold uniformly at every time step after a finite burn-in period. This leads to a notion of dynamic learnability which captures how the structure of a system, such as stability, mixing, observability, and spectral properties, governs the number of observations required before reliable prediction becomes possible. We illustrate the framework in the case of linear dynamical systems, showing that accurate prediction can be achieved after finite observation without system identification, by leveraging improper methods based on spectral filtering. We survey the relationship between learning in dynamical systems and classical PAC, online, and universal prediction theories, and suggest directions for studying nonlinear and controlled systems."}

We argue that standard multi-head attention is best seen as a form of tensor lifting: hidden vectors are mapped into a high-dimensional space of pairwise interactions, and learning proceeds by constraining this lifted tensor through gradient descent. This mechanism is extremely expressive but mathematically opaque, because after many layers it becomes very hard to describe the model with a small family of explicit invariants.\n  To explore an alternative, we propose an attention-free architecture based on Grassmann flows. Instead of forming an L by L attention matrix, our Causal Grassmann layer (i) linearly reduces token states, (ii) encodes local token pairs as two-dimensional subspaces on a Grassmann manifold via Plucker coordinates, and (iii) fuses these geometric features back into the hidden states through gated mixing. Information therefore propagates by controlled deformations of low-rank subspaces over multi-scale local windows, so the core computation lives on a finite-dimensional manifold rather than in an unstructured tensor space.\n  On the Wikitext-2 language modeling benchmark, purely Grassmann-based models with 13 to 18 million parameters achieve validation perplexities within about 10 to 15 percent of size-matched Transformers. On the SNLI natural language inference task, a Grassmann-Plucker head on top of DistilBERT slightly outperforms a Transformer head, with best validation and test accuracies of 0.8550 and 0.8538 compared to 0.8545 and 0.8511. We analyze the complexity of Grassmann mixing, show linear scaling in sequence length for fixed rank, and argue that such manifold-based designs offer a more structured route toward geometric and invariant-based interpretations of neural reasoning."}

While neural operator methods such as the Fourier Neural Operator (FNO) and Koopman-inspired extensions achieve good short-term accuracy, their long-term stability is often limited by unconstrained latent representations and cumulative rollout errors. In this work, we introduce an inverse scattering inspired Fourier Neural Operator(IS-FNO), motivated by the reversibility and spectral evolution structure underlying the classical inverse scattering transform. The proposed architecture enforces a near-reversible pairing between lifting and projection maps through an explicitly invertible neural transformation, and models latent temporal evolution using exponential Fourier layers that naturally encode linear and nonlinear spectral dynamics. We systematically evaluate IS-FNO against baseline FNO and Koopman-based models on a range of benchmark PDEs, including the Michelson-Sivashinsky and Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equations (in one and two dimensions), as well as the integrable Korteweg-de Vries and Kadomtsev-Petviashvili equations. The results demonstrate that IS-FNO achieves lower short-term errors and substantially improved long-horizon stability in non-stiff regimes. For integrable systems, reduced IS-FNO variants that embed analytical scattering structure retain competitive long-term accuracy despite limited model capacity. Overall, this work shows that incorporating physical structure -- particularly reversibility and spectral evolution -- into neural operator design significantly enhances robustness and long-term predictive fidelity for nonlinear PDE dynamics."}

Achieving a good trade-off between prediction accuracy and sparsity is still a challenging issue with a potential significant impact from the application point of view. In this work, we revisit binary KLR and propose an extension of the training formulation proposed by Keerthi et al., which is able to induce sparsity in the trained model, while maintaining good testing accuracy. To efficiently solve the dual of this formulation, we devise a decomposition algorithm of Sequential Minimal Optimization type which exploits second-order information, and for which we establish global convergence.

Most research to-date builds on domain-knowledge-based corruption risk indicators of individual contract-level features and some also analyzes contracting network patterns. A critical barrier for supervised machine learning is the absence of confirmed non-corrupt, negative, examples, which makes conventional machine learning inappropriate for this task. Using publicly available data on federally funded procurement in Mexico and company sanction records, this study implements positive-unlabeled (PU) learning algorithms that integrate domain-knowledge-based red flags with network-derived features to identify likely corrupt and fraudulent contracts. The best-performing PU model on average captures 32 percent more known positives and performs on average 2.3 times better than random guessing, substantially outperforming approaches based solely on traditional red flags. The analysis of the Shapley Additive Explanations reveals that network-derived features, particularly those associated with contracts in the network core or suppliers with high eigenvector centrality, are the most important. Traditional red flags further enhance model performance in line with expectations, albeit mainly for contracts awarded through competitive tenders.

To date, long-term and accurate MJO prediction has remained a challenge for researchers. Conventional MJO prediction methods using Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) are resource-intensive, time-consuming, and highly unstable (most NWP methods are sensitive to seasons, with better MJO forecast results in winter). While existing Artificial Neural Network (ANN) methods save resources and speed forecasting, their accuracy never reaches the 28 days predicted by the state-of-the-art NWP method, i.e., the operational forecasts from ECMWF, since neural networks cannot handle climate data effectively. In this paper, we present a Domain Knowledge Embedded Spatio-Temporal Network (DK-STN), a stable neural network model for accurate and efficient MJO forecasting. It combines the benefits of NWP and ANN methods and successfully improves the forecast accuracy of ANN methods while maintaining a high level of efficiency and stability. We begin with a spatial-temporal network (STN) and embed domain knowledge in it using two key methods: (i) applying a domain knowledge enhancement method and (ii) integrating a domain knowledge processing method into network training. We evaluated DK-STN with the 5th generation of ECMWF reanalysis (ERA5) data and compared it with ECMWF. Given 7 days of climate data as input, DK-STN can generate reliable forecasts for the following 28 days in 1-2 seconds, with an error of only 2-3 days in different seasons. DK-STN significantly exceeds ECMWF in that its forecast accuracy is equivalent to ECMWF's, while its efficiency and stability are significantly superior."}

Existing CI tests often rely on restrictive structural conditions, limiting their validity on real-world data. Kernel methods using the partial covariance operator offer a more principled approach but suffer from limited adaptivity, slow convergence, and poor scalability. In this work, we explore whether representation learning can help address these limitations. Specifically, we focus on representations derived from the singular value decomposition of the partial covariance operator and use them to construct a simple test statistic, reminiscent of the Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion (HSIC). We also introduce a practical bi-level contrastive algorithm to learn these representations. Our theory links representation learning error to test performance and establishes asymptotic validity and power guarantees. Preliminary experiments suggest that this approach offers a practical and statistically grounded path toward scalable CI testing, bridging kernel-based theory with modern representation learning."}

Unlike existing methods that primarily address conflicts between objectives, LacaDM learns latent temporal causal relationships between environmental states and policies, enabling efficient knowledge transfer across diverse MORL scenarios. By embedding these causal structures within a diffusion model-based framework, LacaDM achieves a balance between conflicting objectives while maintaining strong generalization capabilities in previously unseen environments. Empirical evaluations on various tasks from the MOGymnasium framework demonstrate that LacaDM consistently outperforms the state-of-art baselines in terms of hypervolume, sparsity, and expected utility maximization, showcasing its effectiveness in complex multiobjective tasks."}

However, learning-based scheduling on unrelated parallel machines remains particularly difficult to design. Not only do the numbers of jobs and machines vary, but each job-machine pair has a unique processing time, dynamically altering feature dimensions. We propose a novel approach with a neural network tailored for offline deterministic scheduling of arbitrary sizes on unrelated machines. The goal is to minimize a complex objective function that includes the makespan and the weighted tardiness of jobs and machines. Unlike existing online approaches, which process jobs sequentially, our method generates a complete schedule considering the entire input at once. The key contribution of this work lies in the sophisticated architecture of our model. By leveraging various NLP-inspired architectures, it effectively processes any number of jobs and machines with varying feature dimensions imposed by unrelated processing times. Our approach enables supervised training on small problem instances while demonstrating strong generalization to much larger scheduling environments. Trained and tested on instances with 8 jobs and 4 machines, costs were only 2.51% above optimal. Across all tested configurations of up to 100 jobs and 10 machines, our network consistently outperformed an advanced dispatching rule, which incurred 22.22% higher costs on average. As our method allows fast retraining with simulated data and adaptation to various scheduling conditions, we believe it has the potential to become a standard approach for learning-based scheduling on unrelated machines and similar problem environments."}

We propose an online algorithm for ordinal regression using directional feedback. The proposed algorithm uses an exploration-exploitation scheme to learn from directional feedback efficiently. Furthermore, we introduce its kernel-based variant to learn non-linear ordinal regression models in an online setting. We use a truncation trick to make the kernel implementation more memory efficient. The proposed algorithm maintains the ordering of the thresholds in the expected sense.

We present CARE (Contrastive Anchored REflection), a failure-centric post-training framework for multimodal reasoning that turns errors into supervision. CARE combines: (i) an anchored-contrastive objective that forms a compact subgroup around the best rollout and a set of semantically proximate hard negatives, performs within-subgroup z-score normalization with negative-only scaling, and includes an all-negative rescue to prevent zero-signal batches; and (ii) Reflection-Guided Resampling (RGR), a one-shot structured self-repair that rewrites a representative failure and re-scores it with the same verifier, converting near-misses into usable positives without any test-time reflection. CARE improves accuracy and training smoothness while explicitly increasing the share of learning signal that comes from failures. On Qwen2.5-VL-7B, CARE lifts macro-averaged accuracy by 4.6 points over GRPO across six verifiable visual-reasoning benchmarks; with Qwen3-VL-8B it reaches competitive or state-of-the-art results on MathVista and MMMU-Pro under an identical evaluation protocol."}

Neural operator (NO) surrogates offer fast inference across parametric and functional inputs; however, most autoregressive NO frameworks remain vulnerable to compounding errors, and ensemble-averaged metrics provide limited guarantees for individual inference trajectories. In practice, error accumulation can become unacceptable beyond the training horizon, and existing methods lack mechanisms for online monitoring or correction. To address this gap, we propose ANCHOR (Adaptive Numerical Correction for High-fidelity Operator Rollouts), an online, instance-aware hybrid inference framework for stable long-horizon prediction of nonlinear, time-dependent PDEs. ANCHOR treats a pretrained NO as the primary inference engine and adaptively couples it with a classical numerical solver using a physics-informed, residual-based error estimator. Inspired by adaptive time-stepping in numerical analysis, ANCHOR monitors an exponential moving average (EMA) of the normalized PDE residual to detect accumulating error and trigger corrective solver interventions without requiring access to ground-truth solutions. We show that the EMA-based estimator correlates strongly with the true relative L2 error, enabling data-free, instance-aware error control during inference. Evaluations on four canonical PDEs: 1D and 2D Burgers', 2D Allen-Cahn, and 3D heat conduction, demonstrate that ANCHOR reliably bounds long-horizon error growth, stabilizes extrapolative rollouts, and significantly improves robustness over standalone neural operators, while remaining substantially more efficient than high-fidelity numerical solvers."}

Understanding how policy evolves across layers and modules is therefore crucial for enabling more targeted optimization and raveling out complex reasoning mechanisms. In this paper, we decompose the language model policy by leveraging the intrinsic split of the Transformer residual stream and the equivalence between the composition of hidden states with the unembedding matrix and the resulting samplable policy. This decomposition reveals Internal Layer Policies, corresponding to contributions from individual layers, and Internal Modular Policies, which align with the self-attention and feed-forward network (FFN) components within each layer. By analyzing the entropy of internal policy, we find that: (a) Early layers keep high entropy for exploration, top layers converge to near-zero entropy for refinement, with convergence patterns varying across model series. (b) LLama's prediction space rapidly converges in the final layer, whereas Qwen-series models, especially Qwen3, exhibit a more human-like, progressively structured reasoning pattern. Motivated by these findings, we propose Bottom-up Policy Optimization (BuPO), a novel RL paradigm that directly optimizes the internal layer policy during early training. By aligning training objective at lower layer, BuPO reconstructs foundational reasoning capabilities and achieves superior performance.

However, statistical heterogeneity arising from non-identically distributed local data creates a fundamental challenge: nodes must learn personalized models adapted to their local distributions while selectively collaborating with compatible peers. Existing approaches either enforce a single global model that fits no one well, or rely on heuristic peer selection mechanisms that cannot distinguish between peers with genuinely incompatible data distributions and those with valuable complementary knowledge. We present Murmura, a framework that leverages evidential deep learning to enable trust-aware model personalization in DFL. Our key insight is that epistemic uncertainty from Dirichlet-based evidential models directly indicates peer compatibility: high epistemic uncertainty when a peer's model evaluates local data reveals distributional mismatch, enabling nodes to exclude incompatible influence while maintaining personalized models through selective collaboration. Murmura introduces a trust-aware aggregation mechanism that computes peer compatibility scores through cross-evaluation on local validation samples and personalizes model aggregation based on evidential trust with adaptive thresholds. Evaluation on three wearable IoT datasets (UCI HAR, PAMAP2, PPG-DaLiA) demonstrates that Murmura reduces performance degradation from IID to non-IID conditions compared to baseline (0.9% vs. 19.3%), achieves 7.4$\\times$ faster convergence, and maintains stable accuracy across hyperparameter choices.

In the last decade, deep learning recommender models (DLRMs) are the de-facto standard in this field. The main bottleneck in DLRM inference is the lookup of sparse features across huge embedding tables, which are usually partitioned across the aggregate RAM of many nodes. In state-of-the-art recommender systems, the distributed lookup is implemented via irregular all-to-all (alltoallv) communication, and often presents the main bottleneck. Today, most related work sees this operation as a given; in addition, every collective is synchronous in nature. In this work, we propose a novel bounded lag synchronous (BLS) version of the alltoallv operation. The bound can be a parameter allowing slower processes to lag behind entire iterations before the fastest processes block. In special applications such as inference-only DLRM, the accuracy of the application is fully preserved. We implement BLS alltoallv in a new PyTorch Distributed backend and evaluate it with a BLS version of the reference DLRM code. We show that for well balanced, homogeneous-access DLRM runs our BLS technique does not offer notable advantages. But for unbalanced runs, e.g. runs with strongly irregular embedding table accesses or with delays across different processes, our BLS technique improves both the latency and throughput of inference-only DLRM. In the best-case scenario, the proposed reduced synchronisation can mask the delays across processes altogether."}
