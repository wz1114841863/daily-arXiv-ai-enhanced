### [1] [Fast and Scalable Mixed Precision Euclidean Distance Calculations Using GPU Tensor Cores](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21230)
*Brian Curless,Michael Gowanlock*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: 提出FaSTED算法，利用GPU张量核心的FP16-32混合精度计算欧氏距离，相比现有FP64算法获得2.5-51倍加速，精度损失小于0.06%


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代GPU张量核心具有高计算吞吐量，但主要应用于AI矩阵乘法。研究如何利用其混合精度能力（FP16矩阵乘和FP32累加）来加速数据分析和相似性搜索中常用的欧氏距离计算

Method: 设计FaSTED算法，通过层次化数据重用策略，在全局内存、共享内存和寄存器各级最大化内存利用率，优化张量核心的数据供给

Result: 在4个真实高维数据集（128-960维）上测试，相比现有FP64张量核心算法和FP32 CUDA核心算法，获得2.5-51倍速度提升，精度损失小于0.06%

Conclusion: FaSTED算法成功利用GPU张量核心的混合精度能力，显著加速欧氏距离计算，为数据分析和相似性搜索应用提供高效解决方案

Abstract: Modern GPUs are equipped with tensor cores (TCs) that are commonly used for
matrix multiplication in artificial intelligence workloads. However, because
they have high computational throughput, they can lead to significant
performance gains in other algorithms if they can be successfully exploited. We
examine using TCs to compute Euclidean distance calculations, which are used in
many data analytics applications. Prior work has only investigated using 64 bit
floating point (FP64) data for computation; however, TCs can operate on lower
precision floating point data (i.e., 16 bit matrix multiplication and 32 bit
accumulation), which we refer to as FP16-32. FP16-32 TC peak throughput is so
high that TCs are easily starved of data. We propose a Fast and Scalable Tensor
core Euclidean Distance (FaSTED) algorithm. To achieve high computational
throughput, we design FaSTED for significant hierarchical reuse of data and
maximize memory utilization at every level (global memory, shared memory, and
registers). We apply FaSTED to the application of similarity searches, which
typically employ an indexing data structure to eliminate superfluous Euclidean
distance calculations. We compare to the state-of-the-art (SOTA) TC Euclidean
distance algorithm in the literature that employs FP64, as well as to two
single precision (FP32) CUDA core algorithms that both employ an index. We find
that across four real-world high-dimensional datasets spanning 128-960
dimensions, the mixed-precision brute force approach achieves a speedup over
the SOTA algorithms of 2.5-51x. We also quantify the accuracy loss of our mixed
precision algorithm to be less than <0.06% when compared to the FP64 baseline.

Conclusion: DFedRW方法能够有效解决联邦学习中的异构数据问题，提高演进速度和模型准确性，具有更好的通信效率和稳健性。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is a communication-efficient distributed machine
learning method that allows multiple devices to collaboratively train models
without sharing raw data. FL can be categorized into centralized and
decentralized paradigms. The centralized paradigm relies on a central server to
aggregate local models, potentially resulting in single points of failure,
communication bottlenecks, and exposure of model parameters. In contrast, the
decentralized paradigm, which does not require a central server, provides
improved robustness and privacy. The essence of federated learning lies in
leveraging multiple local updates for efficient communication. However, this
approach may result in slower convergence or even convergence to suboptimal
models in the presence of heterogeneous and imbalanced data. To address this
challenge, we study decentralized federated averaging via random walk (DFedRW),
which replaces multiple local update steps on a single device with random walk
updates. Traditional Federated Averaging (FedAvg) and its decentralized
versions commonly ignore stragglers, which reduces the amount of training data
and introduces sampling bias. Therefore, we allow DFedRW to aggregate partial
random walk updates, ensuring that each computation contributes to the model
update. To further improve communication efficiency, we also propose a
quantized version of DFedRW. We demonstrate that (quantized) DFedRW achieves
convergence upper bound of order $\mathcal{O}(\frac{1}{k^{1-q}})$ under convex
conditions. Furthermore, we propose a sufficient condition that reveals when
quantization balances communication and convergence. Numerical analysis
indicates that our proposed algorithms outperform (decentralized) FedAvg in
both convergence rate and accuracy, achieving a 38.3\% and 37.5\% increase in
test accuracy under high levels of heterogeneities.

### [3] [Addressing Reproducibility Challenges in HPC with Continuous Integration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21289)
*Valérie Hayot-Sasson,Nathaniel Hudson,André Bauer,Maxime Gonthier,Ian Foster,Kyle Chard*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: 本文提出CORRECT GitHub Action工具，通过安全的远程HPC资源测试执行来解决HPC领域可重复性研究的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: HPC社区虽然采用激励措施促进可重复研究，但由于基础设施和软件的独特性以及严格的访问限制，许多论文仍无法满足可重复性要求。

Method: 开发了CORRECT GitHub Action工具，支持在远程HPC资源上安全执行测试，结合持续集成(CI)和完整的溯源信息来替代资源访问限制。

Result: 在三种不同类型的HPC应用上评估了CORRECT的可用性，证明了其在自动化和记录可重复性评估方面的有效性。

Conclusion: 更好的HPC兼容CI解决方案将提高应用程序的可重复性，CORRECT工具为解决现有限制提供了有效途径。

Abstract: The high-performance computing (HPC) community has adopted incentive
structures to motivate reproducible research, with major conferences awarding
badges to papers that meet reproducibility requirements. Yet, many papers do
not meet such requirements. The uniqueness of HPC infrastructure and software,
coupled with strict access requirements, may limit opportunities for
reproducibility. In the absence of resource access, we believe that regular
documented testing, through continuous integration (CI), coupled with complete
provenance information, can be used as a substitute. Here, we argue that better
HPC-compliant CI solutions will improve reproducibility of applications. We
present a survey of reproducibility initiatives and describe the barriers to
reproducibility in HPC. To address existing limitations, we present a GitHub
Action, CORRECT, that enables secure execution of tests on remote HPC
resources. We evaluate CORRECT's usability across three different types of HPC
applications, demonstrating the effectiveness of using CORRECT for automating
and documenting reproducibility evaluations.

Conclusion: KD-AFRL框架有效解决了多域IoT应用调度问题，在性能、效率和可扩展性方面都表现出显著优势，为异构云边端环境提供了实用的分布式调度解决方案。

Abstract: The rapid proliferation of Internet of Things (IoT) applications across
heterogeneous Cloud-Edge-IoT environments presents significant challenges in
distributed scheduling optimization. Existing approaches face issues, including
fixed neural network architectures that are incompatible with computational
heterogeneity, non-Independent and Identically Distributed (non-IID) data
distributions across IoT scheduling domains, and insufficient cross-domain
collaboration mechanisms. This paper proposes KD-AFRL, a Knowledge
Distillation-empowered Adaptive Federated Reinforcement Learning framework that
addresses multi-domain IoT application scheduling through three core
innovations. First, we develop a resource-aware hybrid architecture generation
mechanism that creates dual-zone neural networks enabling heterogeneous devices
to participate in collaborative learning while maintaining optimal resource
utilization. Second, we propose a privacy-preserving environment-clustered
federated learning approach that utilizes differential privacy and K-means
clustering to address non-IID challenges and facilitate effective collaboration
among compatible domains. Third, we introduce an environment-oriented
cross-architecture knowledge distillation mechanism that enables efficient
knowledge transfer between heterogeneous models through temperature-regulated
soft targets. Comprehensive experiments with real Cloud-Edge-IoT infrastructure
demonstrate KD-AFRL's effectiveness using diverse IoT applications. Results
show significant improvements over the best baseline, with 21% faster
convergence and 15.7%, 10.8%, and 13.9% performance gains in completion time,
energy consumption, and weighted cost, respectively. Scalability experiments
reveal that KD-AFRL achieves 3-5 times better performance retention compared to
existing solutions as the number of domains increases.

Abstract: The evolution of blockchain technology, from its origins as a decentralized
ledger for cryptocurrencies to its broader applications in areas like
decentralized finance (DeFi), has significantly transformed financial
ecosystems while introducing new challenges such as Maximum Extractable Value
(MEV). This paper explores MEV on the Polygon blockchain, with a particular
focus on Atomic Arbitrage (AA) transactions. We establish criteria for
identifying AA transactions and analyze key factors such as searcher behavior,
bidding dynamics, and token usage. Utilizing a dataset spanning 22 months and
covering 23 million blocks, we examine MEV dynamics with a focus on Spam-based
and Auction-based backrunning strategies. Our findings reveal that while
Spam-based transactions are more prevalent, Auction-based transactions
demonstrate greater profitability. Through detailed examples and analysis, we
investigate the interactions between network architecture, transaction
sequencing, and MEV extraction, offering comprehensive insights into the
evolution and challenges of MEV in decentralized ecosystems. These results
emphasize the need for robust transaction ordering mechanisms and highlight the
implications of emerging MEV strategies for blockchain networks.

Abstract: Training large language models faces frequent interruptions due to various
faults, demanding robust fault-tolerance. Existing backup-free methods, such as
redundant computation, dynamic parallelism, and data rerouting, each incur
performance penalties, whether from ongoing overhead, lengthy reconfigurations,
or post-recovery inefficiencies. We propose Odyssey, an adaptive fault-tolerant
system that intelligently selects optimal recovery strategies when a failure
occurs. Odyssey achieves this through a unified performance model, expedient
execution plan search, accurate performance estimation, and efficient
communication optimizations. Experiments on a 32-card cluster show that Odyssey
maintains a performance gap of within 11.00% between post-recovery and
failure-free training, while preserving model convergence and efficient memory
usage. Compared to state-of-the-art methods, Odyssey achieves up to 1.229x and
1.355x higher average throughput than Oobleck and Recycle, respectively.

TL;DR: SpecMoEOff通过推测解码技术扩大专家模型的工作负载，结合理论分析和经验优化，在GPU和CPU之间协调工作，实现了比现有MoE卸载技术最高2.5倍的解码吞吐量提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的MoE模型卸载技术由于I/O瓶颈和稀疏计算特性，导致硬件利用率低下，需要新的方法来充分利用硬件资源。

Method: 提出SpecMoEOff方法，采用推测解码技术扩大每个专家的工作负载；通过理论和经验分析协调GPU和CPU；开发专用的CPU分块注意力验证内核；集成优化器自动调整推测解码的超参数。

Result: 实验结果显示，SpecMoEOff相比最先进的MoE卸载技术，实现了最高2.5倍的解码吞吐量提升。

Conclusion: SpecMoEOff通过推测解码和硬件协调优化，有效解决了MoE模型卸载中的硬件利用率问题，显著提升了推理性能。

Abstract: Recent advancements in Mixture of Experts (MoE) models have significantly
increased their parameter scale as well as model performance. Extensive
offloading techniques have been proposed to address the GPU memory limitations
of MoE inference. However, due to the I/O bottleneck and sparse computation of
MoE models, existing offloading techniques still suffer from low hardware
utilization. To fully utilize the hardware resources, we propose SpecMoEOff,
which employs the speculative decoding technique to enlarge the workload of
each expert. SpecMoEOff orchestrates the GPU and CPU by both theoretical and
empirical roofline analysis. In addition, we develop a dedicated CPU chunked
attention verification kernel to fit the speculative decoding in offloading
scenarios as well as minimizing the additional overhead led by draft models.
SpecMoEOff further integrates an optimizer to automatically tune the
hyperparameters of speculative decoding under given hardware and workload.
Experimental results show that SpecMoEOff achieves up to 2.5x decode throughput
improvement over the state-of-the-art MoE offloading techniques.

TL;DR: 基于超导电子学(SCE)的专用硬件加速器SCE-NTT，针对全同态加密中的数论变换(NTT)瓶颈，实现了531百万次NTT/秒的高性能，比最先进CMOS方案快100倍以上


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 全同态加密(FHE)中的数论变换(NTT)是计算瓶颈，传统CMOS技术存在性能限制，需要探索超导电子学来突破性能边界

Method: 提出基于超导单磁通量子(SFQ)逻辑和存储器的深度流水线NTT-128架构，使用移位寄存器内存(SRM)，包含7个处理单元，每个单元有蝴蝶单元、双系数存储器和旋转因子缓冲区

Result: 在34GHz频率下实现531百万次NTT/秒，比CMOS方案快100倍以上；预计可扩展到2^14点NTT约482ns完成；密钥切换吞吐量达163万次操作/秒

Conclusion: SCE加速器在后量子时代具有巨大潜力，可实现可扩展、高能效的安全计算，随着制造技术进步还有进一步性能提升空间

Abstract: This research explores the use of superconductor electronics (SCE) for
accelerating fully homomorphic encryption (FHE), focusing on the
Number-Theoretic Transform (NTT), a key computational bottleneck in FHE
schemes. We present SCE-NTT, a dedicated hardware accelerator based on
superconductive single flux quantum (SFQ) logic and memory, targeting high
performance and energy efficiency beyond the limits of conventional CMOS. To
address SFQ constraints such as limited dense RAM and restricted fanin/fanout,
we propose a deeply pipelined NTT-128 architecture using shift register memory
(SRM). Designed for N=128 32-bit coefficients, NTT-128 comprises log2(N)=7
processing elements (PEs), each featuring a butterfly unit (BU), dual
coefficient memories operating in ping-pong mode via FIFO-based SRM queues, and
twiddle factor buffers. The BU integrates a Shoup modular multiplier optimized
for a small area, leveraging precomputed twiddle factors. A new RSFQ cell
library with over 50 parameterized cells, including compound logic units, was
developed for implementation. Functional and timing correctness were validated
using JoSIM analog simulations and Verilog models. A multiphase clocking scheme
was employed to enhance robustness and reduce path-balancing overhead,
improving circuit reliability. Fabricated results show the NTT-128 unit
achieves 531 million NTT/sec at 34 GHz, over 100x faster than state-of-the-art
CMOS equivalents. We also project that the architecture can scale to larger
sizes, such as a 2^14-point NTT in approximately 482 ns. Key-switch throughput
is estimated at 1.63 million operations/sec, significantly exceeding existing
hardware. These results demonstrate the strong potential of SCE-based
accelerators for scalable, energy-efficient secure computation in the
post-quantum era, with further gains anticipated through advances in
fabrication.

Main category: cs.AR

TL;DR: 提出Catwalk神经元实现，通过重排脉冲序列中的脉冲位置来利用稀疏性，在RNL神经元实现中实现更好的硬件效率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有SRM-RNL神经元实现假设所有输入都携带脉冲，但实际脉冲序列中只有小部分输入在计算周期内真正携带脉冲，这种稀疏性可以被利用来提高硬件效率

Method: 通过一元top-k将脉冲序列中的脉冲重排为排序后的子集簇，显著降低后续并行计数器(PC)累积脉冲输入响应函数的成本

Result: 布局布线结果显示，Catwalk在面积和功耗上分别比现有SRM0-RNL神经元好1.39倍和1.86倍

Conclusion: Catwalk神经元实现通过利用脉冲序列的稀疏性，在RNL神经元实现中显著提高了面积和功率效率

Abstract: Temporal neural networks (TNNs) are neuromorphic neural networks that utilize
bit-serial temporal coding. TNNs are composed of columns, which in turn employ
neurons as their building blocks. Each neuron processes volleys of input
spikes, modulated by associated synaptic weights, on its dendritic inputs.
Recently proposed neuron implementation in CMOS employs a Spike Response Model
(SRM) with a ramp-no-leak (RNL) response function and assumes all the inputs
can carry spikes. However, in actual spike volleys, only a small subset of the
dendritic inputs actually carry spikes in each compute cycle. This form of
sparsity can be exploited to achieve better hardware efficiency. In this paper,
we propose a Catwalk neuron implementation by relocating spikes in a spike
volley as a sorted subset cluster via unary top-k. Such relocation can
significantly reduce the cost of the subsequent parallel counter (PC) for
accumulating the response functions from the spiking inputs. This can lead to
improvements on area and power efficiency in RNL neuron implementation.
Place-and-route results show Catwalk is 1.39x and 1.86x better in area and
power, respectively, as compared to existing SRM0-RNL neurons.

TL;DR: SIRA是一种静态分析技术，通过区间运算确定量化神经网络中张量的范围、尺度和偏置，用于优化FPGA数据流神经网络加速器的资源占用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在嵌入式系统中，激进的量化会使非矩阵乘法操作成为显著的性能和资源瓶颈，需要一种全面的方法来调整推理计算中各操作的精度。

Method: 引入scaled-integer range analysis (SIRA)静态分析技术，利用区间运算确定量化神经网络中张量的范围、尺度和偏置信息，并基于这些信息进行位宽适配、尺度和偏置聚合、连续元素操作转换为阈值操作等优化。

Conclusion: SIRA有效优化了量化神经网络在FPGA上的资源使用，已开源以促进社区在各种应用和硬件平台上的探索。

Abstract: While neural network quantization effectively reduces the cost of matrix
multiplications, aggressive quantization can expose non-matrix-multiply
operations as significant performance and resource bottlenecks on embedded
systems. Addressing such bottlenecks requires a comprehensive approach to
tailoring the precision across operations in the inference computation. To this
end, we introduce scaled-integer range analysis (SIRA), a static analysis
technique employing interval arithmetic to determine the range, scale, and bias
for tensors in quantized neural networks. We show how this information can be
exploited to reduce the resource footprint of FPGA dataflow neural network
accelerators via tailored bitwidth adaptation for accumulators and downstream
operations, aggregation of scales and biases, and conversion of consecutive
elementwise operations to thresholding operations. We integrate SIRA-driven
optimizations into the open-source FINN framework, then evaluate their
effectiveness across a range of quantized neural network workloads and compare
implementation alternatives for non-matrix-multiply operations. We demonstrate
an average reduction of 17% for LUTs, 66% for DSPs, and 22% for accumulator
bitwidths with SIRA optimizations, providing detailed benchmark analysis and
analytical models to guide the implementation style for non-matrix layers.
Finally, we open-source SIRA to facilitate community exploration of its
benefits across various applications and hardware platforms.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法要么使用二进制权重和激活量化牺牲精度来优先考虑硬件效率，要么使用多比特权重和激活获得更高精度但效率有限，需要找到平衡方案

Method: 推导每层权重量化的闭式解以提升二值化权重的表示能力；开发可微分激活量化函数来近似理想多比特函数，避免大量搜索最优设置

Conclusion: BWMA方法成功解决了存内计算加速器上CNN量化中精度与效率的权衡问题，为高效神经网络部署提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Compute-in-memory (CIM) accelerators have emerged as a promising way for
enhancing the energy efficiency of convolutional neural networks (CNNs).
Deploying CNNs on CIM platforms generally requires quantization of network
weights and activations to meet hardware constraints. However, existing
approaches either prioritize hardware efficiency with binary weight and
activation quantization at the cost of accuracy, or utilize multi-bit weights
and activations for greater accuracy but limited efficiency. In this paper, we
introduce a novel binary weight multi-bit activation (BWMA) method for CNNs on
CIM-based accelerators. Our contributions include: deriving closed-form
solutions for weight quantization in each layer, significantly improving the
representational capabilities of binarized weights; and developing a
differentiable function for activation quantization, approximating the ideal
multi-bit function while bypassing the extensive search for optimal settings.
Through comprehensive experiments on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet datasets, we show
that BWMA achieves notable accuracy improvements over existing methods,
registering gains of 1.44\%-5.46\% and 0.35\%-5.37\% on respective datasets.
Moreover, hardware simulation results indicate that 4-bit activation
quantization strikes the optimal balance between hardware cost and model
performance.

Conclusion: 该方法为制裁调查等场景提供了更好的实体变体风险控制，有效解决了支付流中发起方和受益方实体聚类的实际问题。

Abstract: Short text clustering is a known use case in the text analytics community.
When the structure and content falls in the natural language domain e.g.
Twitter posts or instant messages, then natural language techniques can be
used, provided texts are of sufficient length to allow for use of (pre)trained
models to extract meaningful information, such as part-of-speech or topic
annotations. However, natural language models are not suitable for clustering
transaction counterparties, as they are found in bank payment messaging
systems, such as SWIFT. The manually typed tags are typically physical or legal
entity details, which lack sentence structure, while containing all the
variations and noise that manual entry introduces. This leaves a gap in an
investigator or counter-fraud professional's toolset when looking to augment
their knowledge of payment flow originator and beneficiary entities and trace
funds and assets. A gap that vendors traditionally try to close with fuzzy
matching tools. With these considerations in mind, we are proposing a hybrid
string similarity, topic modelling, hierarchical clustering and rule-based
pipeline to facilitate clustering of transaction counterparties, also catering
for unknown number of expected clusters. We are also devising metrics to
supplement the evaluation of the approach, based on the well-known measures of
precision and recall. Testing on a real-life labelled dataset demonstrates
significantly improved performance over a baseline rule-based ('keyword')
approach. The approach retains most of the interpretability found in rule-based
systems, as the former adds an additional level of cluster refinement to the
latter. The resulting workflow reduces the need for manual review. When only a
subset of the population needs to be investigated, such as in sanctions
investigations, the approach allows for better control of the risks of missing
entity variations.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) marks a fundamental shift in how artificial
intelligence is applied in healthcare. Instead of merely predicting outcomes,
RL actively decides interventions with long term goals. Unlike traditional
models that operate on fixed associations, RL systems learn through trial,
feedback, and long-term reward optimization, introducing transformative
possibilities and new risks. From an information fusion lens, healthcare RL
typically integrates multi-source signals such as vitals, labs clinical notes,
imaging and device telemetry using temporal and decision-level mechanisms.
These systems can operate within centralized, federated, or edge architectures
to meet real-time clinical constraints, and naturally span data, features and
decision fusion levels. This survey explore RL's rise in healthcare as more
than a set of tools, rather a shift toward agentive intelligence in clinical
environments. We first structure the landscape of RL techniques including
model-based and model-free methods, offline and batch-constrained approaches,
and emerging strategies for reward specification and uncertainty calibration
through the lens of healthcare constraints. We then comprehensively analyze RL
applications spanning critical care, chronic disease, mental health,
diagnostics, and robotic assistance, identifying their trends, gaps, and
translational bottlenecks. In contrast to prior reviews, we critically analyze
RL's ethical, deployment, and reward design challenges, and synthesize lessons
for safe, human-aligned policy learning. This paper serves as both a a
technical roadmap and a critical reflection of RL's emerging transformative
role in healthcare AI not as prediction machinery, but as agentive clinical
intelligence.

### [14] [Spatiotemporal EEG-Based Emotion Recognition Using SAM Ratings from Serious Games with Hybrid Deep Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21103)
*Abdul Rehman,Ilona Heldal,Jerry Chun-Wei Lin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出基于GAMEEMO数据集的统一多粒度EEG情绪分类框架，使用LSTM-GRU模型在二价、多类和多标签情绪分类任务中取得最佳性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有EEG情绪识别研究多局限于二价预测或特定被试分类，限制了在现实情感计算系统中的泛化能力和部署应用。

Method: 采用结构化预处理策略（时间窗分割、混合统计和频域特征提取、z-score归一化），构建三轴情绪标签编码体系，评估多种机器学习模型和深度神经网络架构。

Result: LSTM-GRU模型表现最佳，在二价分类任务中F1-score达0.932，在多类和多标签情绪分类中准确率分别达到94.5%和90.6%。

Conclusion: 该多粒度框架显著提升了EEG情绪识别的泛化性能，为现实世界情感计算系统的部署提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advancements in EEG-based emotion recognition have shown promising
outcomes using both deep learning and classical machine learning approaches;
however, most existing studies focus narrowly on binary valence prediction or
subject-specific classification, which limits generalizability and deployment
in real-world affective computing systems. To address this gap, this paper
presents a unified, multigranularity EEG emotion classification framework built
on the GAMEEMO dataset, which consists of 14-channel EEG recordings and
continuous self-reported emotion ratings (boring, horrible, calm, and funny)
from 28 subjects across four emotion-inducing gameplay scenarios. Our pipeline
employs a structured preprocessing strategy that comprises temporal window
segmentation, hybrid statistical and frequency-domain feature extraction, and
z-score normalization to convert raw EEG signals into robust, discriminative
input vectors. Emotion labels are derived and encoded across three
complementary axes: (i) binary valence classification based on the averaged
polarity of positive and negative emotion ratings, and (ii) Multi-class emotion
classification, where the presence of the most affective state is predicted.
(iii) Fine-grained multi-label representation via binning each emotion into 10
ordinal classes. We evaluate a broad spectrum of models, including Random
Forest, XGBoost, and SVM, alongside deep neural architectures such as LSTM,
LSTM-GRU, and CNN-LSTM. Among these, the LSTM-GRU model consistently
outperforms the others, achieving an F1-score of 0.932 in the binary valence
task and 94.5% and 90.6% in both multi-class and Multi-Label emotion
classification.

TL;DR: PVPO是一种通过优势参考锚点和数据预采样增强的高效强化学习方法，解决了无评论家方法依赖组内比较导致的局部最优和高计算成本问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 无评论家强化学习方法（特别是组策略）在复杂任务中效率高，但依赖策略内的多重采样和比较来估计优势，容易陷入局部最优并增加计算成本

Method: 使用参考模型提前rollout计算奖励分数作为参考锚点，通过数据预采样评估样本难度并选择高增益数据

Result: 在9个数据集和2个领域的实验中，PVPO实现了最先进的性能，展现了跨任务的强泛化能力和不同规模模型的可扩展性能

Conclusion: PVPO有效纠正了组内比较引入的累积偏差，显著减少了对rollout次数的依赖，提高了训练效率

Abstract: Critic-free reinforcement learning methods, particularly group policies, have
attracted considerable attention for their efficiency in complex tasks.
However, these methods rely heavily on multiple sampling and comparisons within
the policy to estimate advantage, which may cause the policy to fall into local
optimum and increase computational cost. To address these issues, we propose
PVPO, an efficient reinforcement learning method enhanced by an advantage
reference anchor and data pre-sampling. Specifically, we use the reference
model to rollout in advance and employ the calculated reward score as a
reference anchor. Our approach effectively corrects the cumulative bias
introduced by intra-group comparisons and significantly reduces reliance on the
number of rollouts. Meanwhile, the reference model can assess sample difficulty
during data pre-sampling, enabling effective selection of high-gain data to
improve training efficiency. Experiments conducted on nine datasets across two
domains demonstrate that PVPO achieves State-Of-The-Art (SOTA) performance. Our
approach not only demonstrates robust generalization across multiple tasks, but
also exhibits scalable performance across models of varying scales.

TL;DR: SLAC开发了SNL框架和Auto-SNL工具，用于在FPGA上部署实时机器学习推理模型，相比现有工具hls4ml在延迟和资源使用方面表现更优


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LCLS-II自由电子激光器产生的高达1TB/s数据流的实时处理挑战，传统机器学习实现延迟过高，需要专门的FPGA部署方案

Method: 开发SLAC神经网络库(SNL)框架支持FPGA上的实时ML推理，并创建Auto-SNL工具将Python神经网络模型自动转换为SNL兼容的高级综合代码

Result: 在多种神经网络架构、定点精度和合成配置的基准测试中，SNL相比最先进的hls4ml工具在大多数情况下实现了竞争性或更优的延迟性能，某些情况下还能节省FPGA资源

Conclusion: SNL框架展示了其多功能性，为高能物理、医学成像、机器人等领域的实时机器学习应用提供了新的解决方案

Abstract: The LCLS-II Free Electron Laser (FEL) will generate X-ray pulses for beamline
experiments at rates of up to 1~MHz, with detectors producing data throughputs
exceeding 1 TB/s. Managing such massive data streams presents significant
challenges, as transmission and storage infrastructures become prohibitively
expensive. Machine learning (ML) offers a promising solution for real-time data
reduction, but conventional implementations introduce excessive latency, making
them unsuitable for high-speed experimental environments. To address these
challenges, SLAC developed the SLAC Neural Network Library (SNL), a specialized
framework designed to deploy real-time ML inference models on
Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGA). SNL's key feature is the ability to
dynamically update model weights without requiring FPGA resynthesis, enhancing
flexibility for adaptive learning applications. To further enhance usability
and accessibility, we introduce Auto-SNL, a Python extension that streamlines
the process of converting Python-based neural network models into
SNL-compatible high-level synthesis code. This paper presents a benchmark
comparison against hls4ml, the current state-of-the-art tool, across multiple
neural network architectures, fixed-point precisions, and synthesis
configurations targeting a Xilinx ZCU102 FPGA. The results showed that SNL
achieves competitive or superior latency in most tested architectures, while in
some cases also offering FPGA resource savings. This adaptation demonstrates
SNL's versatility, opening new opportunities for researchers and academics in
fields such as high-energy physics, medical imaging, robotics, and many more.

TL;DR: AdaGram是一种高效的全矩阵自适应梯度优化器，通过快速对称分解和矩阵积分器方法降低计算和内存开销，在标准机器学习任务中比对角自适应优化器收敛更快或性能相当。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的自适应梯度方法（如Adagrad）使用对角预处理矩阵，无法捕捉参数相关性。全矩阵自适应方法虽然能建模这些相关性，但计算和内存成本过高，限制了在大规模模型中的应用。

Method: 提出AdaGram优化器，采用快速对称分解计算预处理更新方向，并使用矩阵积分器方法保持预处理器的低秩结构，从而降低内存和计算开销。

Result: 数值实验表明，使用秩五及更小秩近似时，AdaGram比对角自适应优化器收敛更快或性能相当。

Conclusion: AdaGram为大规模模型中的自适应优化提供了一个可扩展的解决方案，能够有效捕捉参数相关性同时保持计算效率。

Abstract: Adaptive gradient methods like Adagrad and its variants are widespread in
large-scale optimization. However, their use of diagonal preconditioning
matrices limits the ability to capture parameter correlations. Full-matrix
adaptive methods, approximating the exact Hessian, can model these correlations
and may enable faster convergence. At the same time, their computational and
memory costs are often prohibitive for large-scale models. To address this
limitation, we propose AdaGram, an optimizer that enables efficient full-matrix
adaptive gradient updates. To reduce memory and computational overhead, we
utilize fast symmetric factorization for computing the preconditioned update
direction at each iteration. Additionally, we maintain the low-rank structure
of a preconditioner along the optimization trajectory using matrix integrator
methods. Numerical experiments on standard machine learning tasks show that
AdaGram converges faster or matches the performance of diagonal adaptive
optimizers when using rank five and smaller rank approximations. This
demonstrates AdaGram's potential as a scalable solution for adaptive
optimization in large models.

Abstract: This paper presents a Deep Learning (DL) framework for 48-hour forecasting of
temperature, solar irradiance, and relative humidity to support Model
Predictive Control (MPC) in smart HVAC systems. The approach employs a stacked
Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) network with attention, capturing
temporal and cross-feature dependencies by jointly predicting all three
variables. Historical meteorological data (2019-2022) with encoded cyclical
time features were used for training, while 2023 data evaluated generalization.
The model achieved Mean Absolute Errors of 1.3 degrees Celsius (temperature),
31 W/m2 (irradiance), and 6.7 percentage points (humidity), outperforming
state-of-the-art numerical weather prediction and machine learning benchmarks.
Integrated Gradients quantified feature contributions, and attention weights
revealed temporal patterns, enhancing interpretability. By combining
multivariate forecasting, attention-based DL, and explainability, this work
advances data-driven weather prediction. The demonstrated accuracy and
transparency highlight the framework's potential for energy-efficient building
control through reliable short-term meteorological forecasting.

Conclusion: 该系统为DSN维护和操作提供了有效的异常检测解决方案，所有组件都可以通过人工反馈随时间改进和微调，支持未来太空任务的持续运行。

Abstract: The Deep Space Network (DSN) is NASA's largest network of antenna facilities
that generate a large volume of multivariate time-series data. These facilities
contain DSN antennas and transmitters that undergo degradation over long
periods of time, which may cause costly disruptions to the data flow and
threaten the earth-connection of dozens of spacecraft that rely on the Deep
Space Network for their lifeline. The purpose of this study was to experiment
with different methods that would be able to assist JPL engineers with directly
pinpointing anomalies and equipment degradation through collected data, and
continue conducting maintenance and operations of the DSN for future space
missions around our universe. As such, we have researched various machine
learning techniques that can fully reconstruct data through predictive
analysis, and determine anomalous data entries within real-time datasets
through statistical computations and thresholds. On top of the fully trained
and tested machine learning models, we have also integrated the use of a
reinforcement learning subsystem that classifies identified anomalies based on
severity level and a Large Language Model that labels an explanation for each
anomalous data entry, all of which can be improved and fine-tuned over time
through human feedback/input. Specifically, for the DSN transmitters, we have
also implemented a full data pipeline system that connects the data extraction,
parsing, and processing workflow all together as there was no coherent program
or script for performing these tasks before. Using this data pipeline system,
we were able to then also connect the models trained from DSN antenna data,
completing the data workflow for DSN anomaly detection. This was all wrapped
around and further connected by an agentic AI system, where complex reasoning
was utilized to determine the classifications and predictions of anomalous
data.

TL;DR: 提出PILOT方法，将LLM路由建模为上下文多臂赌博机问题，通过共享嵌入空间和在线学习实现自适应模型选择，同时考虑成本约束。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM路由方法假设已知最优查询-模型配对，但现实场景缺乏完整映射且查询动态变化，需要自适应决策方案。

Method: 构建查询和LLM的共享嵌入空间，基于离线人类偏好数据初始化，通过LinUCB扩展算法PILOT进行在线学习，并引入多选择背包问题处理成本约束。

Result: 提出了能够自适应选择最适合LLM的框架，无需对所有查询进行全模型推理，实现了资源高效的动态路由。

Conclusion: 将LLM路由建模为上下文赌博机问题有效解决了现实场景中的自适应决策挑战，PILOT方法在成本和性能间取得了良好平衡。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized natural language processing,
but their varying capabilities and costs pose challenges in practical
applications. LLM routing addresses this by dynamically selecting the most
suitable LLM for each query/task. Previous approaches treat this as a
supervised learning problem, assuming complete knowledge of optimal query-LLM
pairings. However, real-world scenarios lack such comprehensive mappings and
face evolving user queries. We thus propose to study LLM routing as a
contextual bandit problem, enabling adaptive decision-making using bandit
feedback without requiring exhaustive inference across all LLMs for all queries
(in contrast to supervised routing). To address this problem, we develop a
shared embedding space for queries and LLMs, where query and LLM embeddings are
aligned to reflect their affinity. This space is initially learned from offline
human preference data and refined through online bandit feedback. We
instantiate this idea through Preference-prior Informed Linucb fOr adaptive
rouTing (PILOT), a novel extension of LinUCB. To handle diverse user budgets
for model routing, we introduce an online cost policy modeled as a multi-choice
knapsack problem, ensuring resource-efficient routing.

Result: 在涵盖多样化数据集、模型架构和攻击参数的全面基准测试中，Gen-LRA在多个性能指标上始终优于其他生成模型MIA方法

Conclusion: Gen-LRA作为合成数据发布的隐私审计工具非常有效，突显了生成模型过拟合在现实应用中带来的重大隐私风险

Abstract: Auditing the privacy leakage of synthetic data is an important but unresolved
problem. Most existing privacy auditing frameworks for synthetic data rely on
heuristics and unreasonable assumptions to attack the failure modes of
generative models, exhibiting limited capability to describe and detect the
privacy exposure of training data through synthetic data release. In this
paper, we study designing Membership Inference Attacks (MIAs) that specifically
exploit the observation that tabular generative models tend to significantly
overfit to certain regions of the training distribution. Here, we propose
Generative Likelihood Ratio Attack (Gen-LRA), a novel, computationally
efficient No-Box MIA that, with no assumption of model knowledge or access,
formulates its attack by evaluating the influence a test observation has in a
surrogate model's estimation of a local likelihood ratio over the synthetic
data. Assessed over a comprehensive benchmark spanning diverse datasets, model
architectures, and attack parameters, we find that Gen-LRA consistently
dominates other MIAs for generative models across multiple performance metrics.
These results underscore Gen-LRA's effectiveness as a privacy auditing tool for
the release of synthetic data, highlighting the significant privacy risks posed
by generative model overfitting in real-world applications.

Conclusion: 深度残差回声状态网络通过残差连接有效提升了长期时间建模性能，为未训练循环神经网络提供了新的架构设计思路

Abstract: Echo State Networks (ESNs) are a particular type of untrained Recurrent
Neural Networks (RNNs) within the Reservoir Computing (RC) framework, popular
for their fast and efficient learning. However, traditional ESNs often struggle
with long-term information processing. In this paper, we introduce a novel
class of deep untrained RNNs based on temporal residual connections, called
Deep Residual Echo State Networks (DeepResESNs). We show that leveraging a
hierarchy of untrained residual recurrent layers significantly boosts memory
capacity and long-term temporal modeling. For the temporal residual
connections, we consider different orthogonal configurations, including
randomly generated and fixed-structure configurations, and we study their
effect on network dynamics. A thorough mathematical analysis outlines necessary
and sufficient conditions to ensure stable dynamics within DeepResESN. Our
experiments on a variety of time series tasks showcase the advantages of the
proposed approach over traditional shallow and deep RC.

Abstract: Tree ensembles are widely recognized for their effectiveness in
classification tasks, achieving state-of-the-art performance across diverse
domains, including bioinformatics, finance, and medical diagnosis. With
increasing emphasis on data privacy and the \textit{right to be forgotten},
several unlearning algorithms have been proposed to enable tree ensembles to
forget sensitive information. However, existing methods are often tailored to a
particular model or rely on the discrete tree structure, making them difficult
to generalize to complex ensembles and inefficient for large-scale datasets. To
address these limitations, we propose FUTURE, a novel unlearning algorithm for
tree ensembles. Specifically, we formulate the problem of forgetting samples as
a gradient-based optimization task. In order to accommodate
non-differentiability of tree ensembles, we adopt the probabilistic model
approximations within the optimization framework. This enables end-to-end
unlearning in an effective and efficient manner. Extensive experiments on
real-world datasets show that FUTURE yields significant and successful
unlearning performance.

Motivation: 形式化理解大型语言模型解码过程中的数学原理，为常见的解码策略（如温度调节、top-k采样等）提供严格的数学解释。

Method: 使用约束变分原理和乘性权重（熵镜像）更新方法，在概率单纯形上分析离散和连续时间下的解码动态过程。

Result: 证明了在固定上下文和温度下，下一个token分布沿光滑轨迹收敛到softmax均衡，温度是时间的精确重缩放，top-k和nucleus采样将流限制在具有相同保证的面内。

Conclusion: 为LLM解码过程提供了严格的数学框架，形式化了"流形遍历"直觉，并揭示了常用解码策略的数学本质，为理解路径依赖的分数调整和幻觉行为奠定了基础。

Abstract: Decoding in large language models is often described as scoring tokens and
normalizing with softmax. We give a minimal, self-contained account of this
step as a constrained variational principle on the probability simplex. The
discrete, normalization-respecting ascent is the classical
multiplicative-weights (entropic mirror) update; its continuous-time limit is
the replicator flow. From these ingredients we prove that, for a fixed context
and temperature, the next-token distribution follows a smooth trajectory inside
the simplex and converges to the softmax equilibrium. This formalizes the
common ``manifold traversal'' intuition at the output-distribution level. The
analysis yields precise, practice-facing consequences: temperature acts as an
exact rescaling of time along the same trajectory, while top-k and nucleus
sampling restrict the flow to a face with identical guarantees. We also outline
a controlled account of path-dependent score adjustments and their connection
to loop-like, hallucination-style behavior. We make no claims about training
dynamics or internal representations; those are deferred to future work.

TL;DR: 研究发现，大语言模型中反直觉的强化学习现象（如单样本训练效果、不精确奖励信号的有效性等）仅在模型与任务已高度对齐时出现，而在更具挑战性的场景中，标准RL方法仍然最有效。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 近期研究发现LLMs在RL训练中出现了一系列反直觉现象，但这些现象适用的具体条件和失效场景尚不明确，需要系统性地探究其根本原因。

Method: 通过系统性的实验验证，在不同模型架构和任务领域中检验一系列反直觉主张，重点关注模型-任务对齐程度（用pass@k准确率衡量）对观察结果的影响。

Result: 研究表明，许多反直觉的RL结果只在模型与任务已高度对齐时出现；在更具挑战性的场景中，这些技术无法驱动实质性学习，而标准RL方法仍然有效。

Conclusion: 模型-任务对齐程度是区分RL观察结果的关键因素，标准RL训练在各种设置中保持稳健性，而反直觉现象仅在对齐良好的特定条件下成立。

Abstract: Recent advances in applying reinforcement learning (RL) to large language
models (LLMs) have led to substantial progress. In particular, a series of
remarkable yet often counterintuitive phenomena have been reported in LLMs,
exhibiting patterns not typically observed in traditional RL settings. For
example, notable claims include that a single training example can match the
performance achieved with an entire dataset, that the reward signal does not
need to be very accurate, and that training solely with negative samples can
match or even surpass sophisticated reward-based methods. However, the precise
conditions under which these observations hold - and, critically, when they
fail - remain unclear. In this work, we identify a key factor that
differentiates RL observations: whether the pretrained model already exhibits
strong Model-Task Alignment, as measured by pass@k accuracy on the evaluated
task. Through a systematic and comprehensive examination of a series of
counterintuitive claims, supported by rigorous experimental validation across
different model architectures and task domains, our findings show that while
standard RL training remains consistently robust across settings, many of these
counterintuitive results arise only when the model and task already exhibit
strong model-task alignment. In contrast, these techniques fail to drive
substantial learning in more challenging regimes, where standard RL methods
remain effective.

Abstract: This work introduces a novel generative continual learning framework based on
self-organizing maps (SOMs) and variational autoencoders (VAEs) to enable
memory-efficient replay, eliminating the need to store raw data samples or task
labels. For high-dimensional input spaces, such as of CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100,
we design a scheme where the SOM operates over the latent space learned by a
VAE, whereas, for lower-dimensional inputs, such as those found in MNIST and
FashionMNIST, the SOM operates in a standalone fashion. Our method stores a
running mean, variance, and covariance for each SOM unit, from which synthetic
samples are then generated during future learning iterations. For the VAE-based
method, generated samples are then fed through the decoder to then be used in
subsequent replay. Experimental results on standard class-incremental
benchmarks show that our approach performs competitively with state-of-the-art
memory-based methods and outperforms memory-free methods, notably improving
over best state-of-the-art single class incremental performance on CIFAR-10 and

*Mohammad Amin Nabian,Sanjay Choudhry*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出基于混合专家(MoE)的元学习框架，动态整合三种先进CFD代理模型，在汽车空气动力学预测中显著降低误差


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高保真CFD仿真计算成本高，现有ML代理模型架构多样但无单一最优方案，需要利用架构多样性提升预测精度

Method: 使用门控网络动态组合三种异构代理模型(DoMINO、X-MeshGraphNet、FigConvNet)，通过熵正则化防止模型坍塌，在DrivAerML数据集上训练验证

Result: MoE模型在所有评估物理量上均显著降低L-2预测误差，优于集成平均和最准确的单个专家模型

Conclusion: MoE框架通过协同整合专业架构的互补优势，为构建更鲁棒准确的复合代理模型提供了有效策略

Abstract: The computational cost associated with high-fidelity CFD simulations remains
a significant bottleneck in the automotive design and optimization cycle. While
ML-based surrogate models have emerged as a promising alternative to accelerate
aerodynamic predictions, the field is characterized by a diverse and rapidly
evolving landscape of specialized neural network architectures, with no single
model demonstrating universal superiority. This paper introduces a novel
meta-learning framework that leverages this architectural diversity as a
strength. We propose a Mixture of Experts (MoE) model that employs a dedicated
gating network to dynamically and optimally combine the predictions from three
heterogeneous, state-of-the-art surrogate models: DoMINO, a decomposable
multi-scale neural operator; X-MeshGraphNet, a scalable multi-scale graph
neural network; and FigConvNet, a factorized implicit global convolution
network. The gating network learns a spatially-variant weighting strategy,
assigning credibility to each expert based on its localized performance in
predicting surface pressure and wall shear stress fields. To prevent model
collapse and encourage balanced expert contributions, we integrate an entropy
regularization term into the training loss function. The entire system is
trained and validated on the DrivAerML dataset, a large-scale, public benchmark
of high-fidelity CFD simulations for automotive aerodynamics. Quantitative
results demonstrate that the MoE model achieves a significant reduction in L-2
prediction error, outperforming not only the ensemble average but also the most
accurate individual expert model across all evaluated physical quantities. This
work establishes the MoE framework as a powerful and effective strategy for
creating more robust and accurate composite surrogate models by synergistically
combining the complementary strengths of specialized architectures.

*Farnoush Rezaei Jafari,Oliver Eberle,Ashkan Khakzar,Neel Nanda*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Relevance Patching (RelP) 是一种新的机制解释性方法，使用层间相关性传播(LRP)系数替代梯度，在保持计算效率的同时比标准属性修补更准确地近似激活修补。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 激活修补是机制解释性的标准方法但计算成本高，属性修补虽然更快但存在噪声和可靠性问题，特别是在深度非线性网络中。

Method: 引入Relevance Patching (RelP)，用LRP的传播系数替代属性修补中的局部梯度，只需两次前向传播和一次反向传播，保持计算效率。

Result: 在多个模型和任务上验证，RelP比标准属性修补更准确地近似激活修补，在GPT-2 Large的IOI任务中，MLP输出的Pearson相关性从0.006提升到0.956。

Conclusion: RelP在保持计算效率的同时显著提高了对激活修补的近似准确性，特别是在深度网络的残差流和MLP输出分析中表现优异。

Abstract: Activation patching is a standard method in mechanistic interpretability for
localizing the components of a model responsible for specific behaviors, but it
is computationally expensive to apply at scale. Attribution patching offers a
faster, gradient-based approximation, yet suffers from noise and reduced
reliability in deep, highly non-linear networks. In this work, we introduce
Relevance Patching (RelP), which replaces the local gradients in attribution
patching with propagation coefficients derived from Layer-wise Relevance
Propagation (LRP). LRP propagates the network's output backward through the
layers, redistributing relevance to lower-level components according to local
propagation rules that ensure properties such as relevance conservation or
improved signal-to-noise ratio. Like attribution patching, RelP requires only
two forward passes and one backward pass, maintaining computational efficiency
while improving faithfulness. We validate RelP across a range of models and
tasks, showing that it more accurately approximates activation patching than
standard attribution patching, particularly when analyzing residual stream and
MLP outputs in the Indirect Object Identification (IOI) task. For instance, for
MLP outputs in GPT-2 Large, attribution patching achieves a Pearson correlation
of 0.006, whereas RelP reaches 0.956, highlighting the improvement offered by
RelP. Additionally, we compare the faithfulness of sparse feature circuits
identified by RelP and Integrated Gradients (IG), showing that RelP achieves
comparable faithfulness without the extra computational cost associated with
IG.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FedOwen是一个高效的联邦学习框架，使用Owen采样来近似计算Shapley值，在相同评估预算下比现有方法误差更小，并通过自适应客户端选择策略实现更好的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦学习中准确估计每个客户端的贡献对于公平奖励和选择最有用的客户端至关重要，但精确计算Shapley值在客户端数量大时计算复杂度呈指数增长，不可行。

Method: 提出FedOwen框架，使用Owen采样近似Shapley值，采用自适应客户端选择策略平衡利用高价值客户端和探索未充分采样的客户端。

Result: 在固定估值成本下，FedOwen在非IID基准测试中比最先进的基线方法在相同通信轮数内实现了高达23%的最终准确率提升。

Conclusion: FedOwen通过高效的Shapley值近似和智能客户端选择，显著提高了联邦学习的效率和性能，特别是在非IID数据场景下。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) aggregates information from multiple clients to train
a shared global model without exposing raw data. Accurately estimating each
client's contribution is essential not just for fair rewards, but for selecting
the most useful clients so the global model converges faster. The Shapley value
is a principled choice, yet exact computation scales exponentially with the
number of clients, making it infeasible for large federations. We propose
FedOwen, an efficient framework that uses Owen sampling to approximate Shapley
values under the same total evaluation budget as existing methods while keeping
the approximation error small. In addition, FedOwen uses an adaptive client
selection strategy that balances exploiting high-value clients with exploring
under-sampled ones, reducing bias and uncovering rare but informative data.
Under a fixed valuation cost, FedOwen achieves up to 23 percent higher final
accuracy within the same number of communication rounds compared to
state-of-the-art baselines on non-IID benchmarks.

### [30] [Guess-and-Learn (G&L): Measuring the Cumulative Error Cost of Cold-Start Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21270)
*Roland Arnold*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Guess-and-Learn (G&L) v1.0 是一个评估机器学习模型冷启动适应性的框架，通过测量模型在从未标注数据集中顺序学习时累积的错误来评估适应成本，而不仅仅是最终准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的机器学习评估过于强调最终准确率，忽视了模型从零开始学习过程中的适应成本（累积错误）。G&L旨在填补这一空白，量化模型在早期学习阶段的错误成本。

Method: G&L定义了四个评估轨道（从零开始/预训练 × 在线/批量），让学习者在每个步骤中选择实例、预测标签、接收真实标签并更新参数。通过错误轨迹分析适应速度、选择质量和偏差。

Result: 在MNIST和AG News上的基线实验显示：小型模型能以较少的初始错误适应，预训练的好处因领域而异。所有当前模型的表现都远高于oracle参考带，存在明显的适应性差距。

Conclusion: G&L通过量化早期学习的错误成本，补充了传统基准测试，为开发既在极限情况下准确又从第一个样本开始就可靠的学习者提供了可复现的框架。

Abstract: Evaluation of machine learning models typically emphasizes final accuracy,
overlooking the cost of adaptation: the cumulative errors incurred while
learning from scratch. Guess-and- Learn (G&L) v1.0 addresses this gap by
measuring cold-start adaptability - the total mistakes a model makes while
sequentially labeling an unlabeled dataset. At each step, the learner selects
an instance, predicts its label, receives the ground truth, and updates
parameters under either online (per-sample) or batch (delayed) mode. The
resulting error trajectory exposes adaptation speed, selection quality, and
bias - dynamics invisible to endpoint metrics.
  G&L defines four tracks (Scratch/Pretrained $\times$ Online/Batch) to
disentangle the effects of initialization and update frequency. We formalize
the protocol, relate it to classical mistake-bound theory, and estimate a
heuristic "oracle reference band" for MNIST as a plausibility reference.
Baseline experiments on MNIST and AG News, spanning classical methods
(Perceptron, k-NN), convolutional architectures (CNN, ResNet-50), and
pretrained transformers (ViT-B/16, BERT-base), reveal systematic differences in
early-phase efficiency: smaller models can adapt with fewer initial errors,
while pretraining benefits vary by domain. Across settings, current models
remain well above the oracle band, highlighting an adaptability gap.
  By quantifying the mistake cost of early learning, G&L complements
conventional benchmarks and provides a reproducible framework for developing
learners that are not only accurate in the limit but also reliable from the
first examples.

TL;DR: CALM框架：基于Apache Beam和TimesFm的实时异常检测系统，通过持续微调和LLM判断机制应对非平稳时间序列中的概念漂移问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统离线训练的异常检测模型在面对数据统计特性随时间变化的概念漂移时性能显著下降，需要开发能够实时适应的解决方案

Method: 基于Apache Beam分布式处理框架，使用TimesFm基础模型进行预测式异常检测，采用闭环持续微调机制和LLM-as-a-Judge组件进行语义判断

Result: 在TSB-UAD基准测试中，持续微调模型相比静态预训练基础模型在大多数数据集上提高了ROC AUC分数

Conclusion: CALM框架通过自适应和LLM引导的方法，在动态流式环境中有效维持了高性能的异常检测能力

Abstract: The detection of anomalies in non-stationary time-series streams is a
critical but challenging task across numerous industrial and scientific
domains. Traditional models, trained offline, suffer significant performance
degradation when faced with concept drift, where the underlying statistical
properties of the data change over time. This paper introduces CALM
(Continuous, Adaptive, and LLM-Mediated), a novel, end-to-end framework for
real-time anomaly detection designed to address this challenge. CALM is built
on the Apache Beam distributed processing framework and leverages the TimesFm
foundation model for forecasting-based anomaly detection. The framework's
novelty lies in two core contributions. First, it implements a closed-loop,
continuous fine-tuning mechanism that allows the anomaly detection model to
adapt to evolving data patterns in near real-time. Second, it introduces an
LLM-as-a-Judge component, a Large Language Model that provides semantic,
context-aware judgments on detected anomalies to curate a high-quality training
dataset, deciding whether an anomaly represents transient noise or a meaningful
pattern shift. We evaluate CALM on the comprehensive TSB-UAD benchmark. Our
results demonstrate that the continuously fine-tuned model improves the ROC AUC
score in most datasets compared to the static, pre-trained base model,
validating the efficacy of our adaptive, LLM-guided approach to maintaining
high-performance anomaly detection in dynamic streaming environments.

Motivation: 肌电信号固有的非平稳性使得域偏移检测成为重大挑战，需要开发有效的实时检测方法来维持稳定的肌电解码模型

Method: 使用KPCA（余弦核）预处理Ninapro数据库的DB6数据集，评估CUSUM、Page-Hinckley和ADWIN等多種漂移检测方法

Result: 当前技术在实现肌电信号实时域偏移检测方面性能有限，显示出局限性

Conclusion: 基于流式学习的方法具有维持稳定肌电解码模型的潜力，但需要在鲁棒性和准确性方面进行进一步研究以提升实际应用效果

Abstract: Detecting domain shifts in myoelectric activations poses a significant
challenge due to the inherent non-stationarity of electromyography (EMG)
signals. This paper explores the detection of domain shifts using data stream
(DS) learning techniques, focusing on the DB6 dataset from the Ninapro
database. We define domains as distinct time-series segments based on different
subjects and recording sessions, applying Kernel Principal Component Analysis
(KPCA) with a cosine kernel to pre-process and highlight these shifts. By
evaluating multiple drift detection methods such as CUSUM, Page-Hinckley, and
ADWIN, we reveal the limitations of current techniques in achieving high
performance for real-time domain shift detection in EMG signals. Our results
underscore the potential of streaming-based approaches for maintaining stable
EMG decoding models, while highlighting areas for further research to enhance
robustness and accuracy in real-world scenarios.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MyGO是一个受生物睡眠-觉醒周期启发的终身学习框架，通过生成式记忆模型和离线知识蒸馏来解决灾难性遗忘问题，无需存储原始数据，在隐私和存储效率方面具有优势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有持续学习方法面临的数据隐私、存储限制以及在任务不相似时性能下降的挑战，避免存储原始样本的需求。

Method: 采用觉醒-睡眠双阶段框架：觉醒阶段快速学习新任务并训练紧凑生成模型；睡眠阶段使用所有生成模型生成伪数据，通过知识蒸馏将新旧知识整合到核心特征提取器中。

Result: 在计算机视觉（Split-MNIST）和自然语言处理（Split-AG News）基准测试中，MyGO显著减轻了灾难性遗忘，保持了跨任务的高平均准确率。

Conclusion: MyGO框架有效解决了终身学习中的关键问题，证明了其有效性和领域通用性，为隐私保护和存储高效的持续学习提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Continual or Lifelong Learning aims to develop models capable of acquiring
new knowledge from a sequence of tasks without catastrophically forgetting what
has been learned before. Existing approaches often rely on storing samples from
previous tasks (experience replay) or employing complex regularization terms to
protect learned weights. However, these methods face challenges related to data
privacy, storage limitations, and performance degradation when tasks are
dissimilar. To address these challenges, we introduce MyGO (Memory Yielding
Generative Offline-consolidation), a novel lifelong learning framework inspired
by the biological wake-sleep cycle. During the "wake" phase, the system rapidly
learns a new task and trains a compact generative model (Generative Memory,
G-mem) to capture its data distribution. During the "sleep" phase, the system
enters an offline state, using all learned G-mem models to generate pseudo-data
("dreams") and consolidate new and old knowledge into a core feature extractor
via knowledge distillation. This approach obviates the need to store any raw
data, retaining only compact generative models, which offers significant
advantages in privacy and storage efficiency. We evaluate MyGO on computer
vision (Split-MNIST) and natural language processing (Split-AG News)
benchmarks, comparing it against a sequential fine-tuning baseline. The results
demonstrate that MyGO significantly mitigates catastrophic forgetting and
maintains high average accuracy across tasks, proving the framework's
effectiveness and domain-generality.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: VILA是一种新型的机器遗忘框架，通过更准确地识别与敏感信息相关的参数并显著降低计算成本，解决了FILA方法在参数重要性估计和计算效率方面的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在生成内容时可能无意中泄露敏感信息，完全重新训练模型计算成本过高。现有的FILA方法虽然通过LoRA适配器实现了参数高效的遗忘，但仍需要访问所有模型参数且Fisher信息估计不准确。

Method: 提出VILA框架，明确考虑FILA忽略的Fisher信息基本假设，提高遗忘集参数识别的准确性。同时实现无需访问整个模型的参数识别，大幅降低计算成本。

Result: 相比FILA，VILA实现了100倍的参数效率和40倍的训练速度提升，在TOFU、WMDP和MUSE基准测试中达到了新的最先进性能。

Conclusion: VILA通过改进参数重要性估计方法和降低计算需求，为机器遗忘提供了一个高效且准确的解决方案，在保护敏感信息的同时显著提升了性能。

Abstract: LLMs have demonstrated remarkable performance across various tasks but face
challenges related to unintentionally generating outputs containing sensitive
information. A straightforward approach to address this issue is to retrain the
model after excluding the problematic data. However, this approach incurs
prohibitively high computational costs. To overcome this limitation, machine
unlearning has emerged as a promising solution that can effectively remove
sensitive information without the need to retrain the model from scratch.
Recently, FILA has been proposed as a parameter-efficient unlearning method by
integrating LoRA adapters. Specifically, it calculates the Fisher information
to identify parameters associated with the forget set and assigns them to LoRA
adapters for updates. Despite its innovative approach, FILA still requires
access to all model parameters and does not adequately account for fundamental
assumptions underlying Fisher information, leading to inaccuracies in
importance estimation. To address these limitations, we propose VILA, a novel
unlearning framework that explicitly considers the assumptions overlooked in
FILA, thereby enhancing the accuracy of parameter identification for the forget
set. Moreover, VILA significantly reduces computational costs by enabling
parameter identification without accessing the entire model. Our method
achieves up to 100x higher parameter efficiency and 40x faster training speed
compared to FILA, and sets new state-of-the-art performance on benchmarks
including TOFU, WMDP, and MUSE. Our code is available at
https://github.com/kyj93790/VILA.

TL;DR: 提出了一个理解Q-learning算法收敛性的理论框架，分析了基于智能体状态和策略正则化的Q-learning算法(RASQL)在温和技术条件下的收敛性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 实际应用中常用的Q-learning算法具有两个显著特征：(i)使用非信念状态的智能体状态递归更新Q表，(ii)经常使用策略正则化来鼓励探索和稳定学习算法。需要从理论上理解这类算法的收敛行为

Method: 提出了正则化智能体状态Q-learning(RASQL)框架，分析了该算法在温和技术条件下的收敛性，证明其收敛到适当定义的正则化MDP的固定点，该固定点依赖于行为策略诱导的平稳分布

Result: 理论分析表明RASQL算法收敛到正则化MDP的固定点，类似分析也适用于学习周期性策略的RASQL变体。数值实验验证了经验收敛行为与理论极限一致

Conclusion: 该研究为理解实践中常用的基于智能体状态和策略正则化的Q-learning算法的收敛性提供了理论框架，证明了其在适当条件下的收敛性，并通过数值实验验证了理论结果

Abstract: In this paper, we present a framework to understand the convergence of
commonly used Q-learning reinforcement learning algorithms in practice. Two
salient features of such algorithms are: (i)~the Q-table is recursively updated
using an agent state (such as the state of a recurrent neural network) which is
not a belief state or an information state and (ii)~policy regularization is
often used to encourage exploration and stabilize the learning algorithm. We
investigate the simplest form of such Q-learning algorithms which we call
regularized agent-state-based Q-learning (RASQL) and show that it converges
under mild technical conditions to the fixed point of an appropriately defined
regularized MDP, which depends on the stationary distribution induced by the
behavioral policy. We also show that a similar analysis continues to work for a
variant of RASQL that learns periodic policies. We present numerical examples
to illustrate that the empirical convergence behavior matches with the proposed
theoretical limit.

TL;DR: Sampled-SAE是一种改进的稀疏自编码器，通过评分特征列并限制候选池大小，在批处理和令牌特定特征选择之间提供可调节的平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决BatchTopK SAE中的"激活彩票"问题，即稀有高幅度特征可能挤掉更有信息量但幅度较低的特征，同时提高重建效率。

Method: 对批次激活矩阵的列（特征）进行评分（使用L2范数或熵），形成大小为Kl的候选池，然后应用Top-K从受限特征池中选择批次中的令牌。

Result: 在Pythia-160M上，没有单一的最优l值，最佳选择取决于共享结构、重建保真度和下游性能之间的权衡。

Conclusion: Sampled-SAE将BatchTopK重新构建为一个可调节的、分布感知的特征选择方法族，允许在不同应用需求下进行灵活配置。

Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) decompose neural activations into interpretable
features. A widely adopted variant, the TopK SAE, reconstructs each token from
its K most active latents. However, this approach is inefficient, as some
tokens carry more information than others. BatchTopK addresses this limitation
by selecting top activations across a batch of tokens. This improves average
reconstruction but risks an "activation lottery," where rare high-magnitude
features crowd out more informative but lower-magnitude ones. To address this
issue, we introduce Sampled-SAE: we score the columns (representing features)
of the batch activation matrix (via $L_2$ norm or entropy), forming a candidate
pool of size $Kl$, and then apply Top-$K$ to select tokens across the batch
from the restricted pool of features. Varying $l$ traces a spectrum between
batch-level and token-specific selection. At $l=1$, tokens draw only from $K$
globally influential features, while larger $l$ expands the pool toward
standard BatchTopK and more token-specific features across the batch. Small $l$
thus enforces global consistency; large $l$ favors fine-grained reconstruction.
On Pythia-160M, no single value optimizes $l$ across all metrics: the best
choice depends on the trade-off between shared structure, reconstruction
fidelity, and downstream performance. Sampled-SAE thus reframes BatchTopK as a
tunable, distribution-aware family.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 长时序数据具有复杂的长期时间依赖性和随时间变化的数据分布漂移，同时包含复杂的特征序列间相互关系，现有生成模型难以有效平衡这些挑战。

Method: 采用分阶段序列生成和阶段间信息传递，保持长期序列依赖的同时建模数据分布漂移；在每个阶段内应用渐进序列分解进行通道独立建模，阶段间使用多通道融合建模。

Result: 在多个真实世界数据集上的广泛实验验证了Stage-Diff在长时序生成任务中的有效性。

Conclusion: Stage-Diff通过结合通道独立建模的鲁棒性和多通道建模的信息融合优势，有效平衡了长时序的序列内和序列间依赖关系，解决了长时序生成的关键挑战。

Abstract: Generative models have been successfully used in the field of time series
generation. However, when dealing with long-term time series, which span over
extended periods and exhibit more complex long-term temporal patterns, the task
of generation becomes significantly more challenging. Long-term time series
exhibit long-range temporal dependencies, but their data distribution also
undergoes gradual changes over time. Finding a balance between these long-term
dependencies and the drift in data distribution is a key challenge. On the
other hand, long-term time series contain more complex interrelationships
between different feature sequences, making the task of effectively capturing
both intra-sequence and inter-sequence dependencies another important
challenge. To address these issues, we propose Stage-Diff, a staged generative
model for long-term time series based on diffusion models. First, through
stage-wise sequence generation and inter-stage information transfer, the model
preserves long-term sequence dependencies while enabling the modeling of data
distribution shifts. Second, within each stage, progressive sequence
decomposition is applied to perform channel-independent modeling at different
time scales, while inter-stage information transfer utilizes multi-channel
fusion modeling. This approach combines the robustness of channel-independent
modeling with the information fusion advantages of multi-channel modeling,
effectively balancing the intra-sequence and inter-sequence dependencies of
long-term time series. Extensive experiments on multiple real-world datasets
validate the effectiveness of Stage-Diff in long-term time series generation
tasks.

Conclusion: DLGAN是一个简单但有效的生成模型，能够有效解决时间序列合成中的时间依赖性和特征捕获问题

Abstract: Time series synthesis is an effective approach to ensuring the secure
circulation of time series data. Existing time series synthesis methods
typically perform temporal modeling based on random sequences to generate
target sequences, which often struggle to ensure the temporal dependencies in
the generated time series. Additionally, directly modeling temporal features on
random sequences makes it challenging to accurately capture the feature
information of the original time series. To address the above issues, we
propose a simple but effective generative model \textbf{D}ual-\textbf{L}ayer
\textbf{G}enerative \textbf{A}dversarial \textbf{N}etworks, named
\textbf{DLGAN}. The model decomposes the time series generation process into
two stages: sequence feature extraction and sequence reconstruction. First,
these two stages form a complete time series autoencoder, enabling supervised
learning on the original time series to ensure that the reconstruction process
can restore the temporal dependencies of the sequence. Second, a Generative
Adversarial Network (GAN) is used to generate synthetic feature vectors that
align with the real-time sequence feature vectors, ensuring that the generator
can capture the temporal features from real time series. Extensive experiments
on four public datasets demonstrate the superiority of this model across
various evaluation metrics.

Motivation: 针对大规模神经网络优化中过度依赖训练损失导致泛化能力差的问题，基于梯度噪声的重尾分布特性和Edge of Stability现象，旨在通过自适应噪声注入来寻找更宽的局部最小值盆地。

Method: 提出自适应重尾随机梯度下降(AHTSGD)，在训练早期注入重尾噪声增强探索，随着锐度稳定逐渐过渡到轻尾噪声，动态适应损失景观的锐度变化。

Result: 在MNIST、CIFAR-10等基准测试中 consistently超越SGD和其他基于噪声的方法，在SVHN等噪声数据集上表现尤为突出，加速了从不良初始化的早期训练。

Conclusion: AHTSGD通过基于Edge of Stability现象动态调整注入噪声特性，有效促进了向宽盆地的收敛，提高了在干净和噪声设置下的泛化能力，且对学习率选择具有鲁棒性。

Abstract: In the era of large-scale neural network models, optimization algorithms
often struggle with generalization due to an overreliance on training loss. One
key insight widely accepted in the machine learning community is the idea that
wide basins (regions around a local minimum where the loss increases gradually)
promote better generalization by offering greater stability to small changes in
input data or model parameters. In contrast, sharp minima are typically more
sensitive and less stable. Motivated by two key empirical observations - the
inherent heavy-tailed distribution of gradient noise in stochastic gradient
descent and the Edge of Stability phenomenon during neural network training, in
which curvature grows before settling at a plateau, we introduce Adaptive Heavy
Tailed Stochastic Gradient Descent (AHTSGD). The algorithm injects
heavier-tailed noise into the optimizer during the early stages of training to
enhance exploration and gradually transitions to lighter-tailed noise as
sharpness stabilizes. By dynamically adapting to the sharpness of the loss
landscape throughout training, AHTSGD promotes accelerated convergence to wide
basins. AHTSGD is the first algorithm to adjust the nature of injected noise
into an optimizer based on the Edge of Stability phenomenon. AHTSGD
consistently outperforms SGD and other noise-based methods on benchmarks like
MNIST and CIFAR-10, with marked gains on noisy datasets such as SVHN. It
ultimately accelerates early training from poor initializations and improves
generalization across clean and noisy settings, remaining robust to learning

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 对Leela Chess Zero策略网络的分析显示，神经网络表示构建不是平滑渐进的过程，而是存在复杂的非单调计算路径，与语言模型的平滑收敛形成鲜明对比


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究神经网络是通过平滑渐进还是复杂计算过程来构建表示，特别针对超人类象棋引擎的策略网络进行分析

Method: 扩展logit lens技术来分析Leela Chess Zero策略网络，通过观察各层的playing strength、puzzle-solving ability和policy distribution的变化轨迹

Result: 发现虽然playing strength和puzzle-solving ability呈现强单调趋势，但policy distribution经常遵循非平滑轨迹，包括早期发现但随后丢弃的正确解、与最终输出相关性差的move rankings，以及直到网络后期仍存在的高policy divergence

Conclusion: 神经网络表示构建过程比语言模型观察到的平滑分布收敛更加复杂，涉及非单调的计算路径，这对理解神经网络内部工作机制具有重要意义

Abstract: Do neural networks build their representations through smooth, gradual
refinement, or via more complex computational processes? We investigate this by
extending the logit lens to analyze the policy network of Leela Chess Zero, a
superhuman chess engine. We find strong monotonic trends in playing strength
and puzzle-solving ability across layers, yet policy distributions frequently
follow non-smooth trajectories. Evidence for this includes correct puzzle
solutions that are discovered early but subsequently discarded, move rankings
that remain poorly correlated with final outputs, and high policy divergence
until late in the network. These findings contrast with the smooth
distributional convergence typically observed in language models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决传统混合模型在处理不同分布族组件时的局限性，以及将理论方法扩展到高维实际应用的需求

Method: 通过数据分区策略，对每个子集分别拟合密度估计器（可以是参数或非参数方法），构建混合模型框架

Conclusion: PMODE提供了一个通用且模块化的混合建模框架，即使在组件来自不同分布族时仍保持有效性，MV-PMODE成功将理论方法扩展到高维实际应用

Abstract: We introduce PMODE (Partitioned Mixture Of Density Estimators), a general and
modular framework for mixture modeling with both parametric and nonparametric
components. PMODE builds mixtures by partitioning the data and fitting separate
estimators to each subset. It attains near-optimal rates for this estimator
class and remains valid even when the mixture components come from different
distribution families. As an application, we develop MV-PMODE, which scales a
previously theoretical approach to high-dimensional density estimation to
settings with thousands of dimensions. Despite its simplicity, it performs
competitively against deep baselines on CIFAR-10 anomaly detection.

Abstract: Using data from mobile network utilization in Norway, we showcase the
possibility of monitoring the state of communication and mobility networks with
a non-invasive, low-cost method. This method transforms the network data into a
model within the framework of reservoir computing and then measures the model's
performance on proxy tasks. Experimentally, we show how the performance on
these proxies relates to the state of the network. A key advantage of this
approach is that it uses readily available data sets and leverages the
reservoir computing framework for an inexpensive and largely agnostic method.
Data from mobile network utilization is available in an anonymous, aggregated
form with multiple snapshots per day. This data can be treated like a weighted
network. Reservoir computing allows the use of weighted, but untrained networks
as a machine learning tool. The network, initialized as a so-called echo state
network (ESN), projects incoming signals into a higher dimensional space, on
which a single trained layer operates. This consumes less energy than deep
neural networks in which every weight of the network is trained. We use
neuroscience inspired tasks and trained our ESN model to solve them. We then
show how the performance depends on certain network configurations and also how
it visibly decreases when perturbing the network. While this work serves as
proof of concept, we believe it can be elevated to be used for near-real-time
monitoring as well as the identification of possible weak spots of both mobile
communication networks as well as transportation networks.

Conclusion: CoM通过解决深度网络中层间依赖性问题，提供了一种有效的模型融合解决方案，显著提升了融合模型的性能表现。

Abstract: Fine-tuning pretrained models has become a standard pathway to achieve
state-of-the-art performance across a wide range of domains, leading to a
proliferation of task-specific model variants. As the number of such
specialized modules in-creases, merging them into a unified model without
retraining has become a critical challenge. Existing merging techniques often
rely on interference heuristics,importance weighting, or activation matching
while treating each layer independently, thereby failing to account for the
inter-layer dependencies inherent in deep networks. This simplification leads
to distributional mismatches, especially inactivation-based methods, when
changes in early layers are not properly reflected in downstream ones. We
identify these mismatches as a form of internal covariate shift, comparable to
the phenomenon encountered in the initial phases of neural networks training.
To address it, we propose Chain of Merges (CoM), a layer-wise merging procedure
that updates activation statistics in an auto-regressive fashion, explicitly
accounting for cross-layer interactions. CoM produces a coherent merged model
through a series of conditionally optimal updates, effectively mitigating
degradation caused by covariate shift. Experiments on standard bench-marks
demonstrate that CoM achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Method: 提出一种基于生成对抗网络(GANs)集成的无监督异常检测框架，并使用混合量子/经典GAN方法，包括模拟量子电路和真实光子量子处理器

Result: 混合量子/经典方法在检测突发料料变异导致的异常时显示出更高的异常检测率

Conclusion: 混合量子/经典方法在复杂连续生物制造过程中具有解决实际问题的潜力

Abstract: The development of continuous biomanufacturing processes requires robust and
early anomaly detection, since even minor deviations can compromise yield and
stability, leading to disruptions in scheduling, reduced weekly production, and
diminished economic performance. These processes are inherently complex and
exhibit non-linear dynamics with intricate relationships between process
variables, thus making advanced methods for anomaly detection essential for
efficient operation. In this work, we present a novel framework for
unsupervised anomaly detection in continuous biomanufacturing based on an
ensemble of generative adversarial networks (GANs). We first establish a
benchmark dataset simulating both normal and anomalous operation regimes in a
continuous process for the production of a small molecule. We then demonstrate
the effectiveness of our GAN-based framework in detecting anomalies caused by
sudden feedstock variability. Finally, we evaluate the impact of using a hybrid
quantum/classical GAN approach with both a simulated quantum circuit and a real
photonic quantum processor on anomaly detection performance. We find that the
hybrid approach yields improved anomaly detection rates. Our work shows the
potential of hybrid quantum/classical approaches for solving real-world
problems in complex continuous biomanufacturing processes.

Motivation: 传统RL算法优化期望累积奖励，但实际部署时个体轨迹性能更重要。需要同时考虑整体平均和个体轨迹的长期表现

Method: 定义了时间平均增长率的Bellman算子，提出几何平均和N滑动窗口的改进几何平均作为估计器，将其作为正则化项嵌入目标函数

Result: 在挑战性模拟中，该算法优于传统RL方法

Conclusion: 成功开发了一种同时利用整体平均和时间平均的实用RL算法，能够更好地优化个体轨迹的长期性能

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms typically optimize the expected
cumulative reward, i.e., the expected value of the sum of scalar rewards an
agent receives over the course of a trajectory. The expected value averages the
performance over an infinite number of trajectories. However, when deploying
the agent in the real world, this ensemble average may be uninformative for the
performance of individual trajectories. Thus, in many applications, optimizing
the long-term performance of individual trajectories might be more desirable.
In this work, we propose a novel RL algorithm that combines the standard
ensemble average with the time-average growth rate, a measure for the long-term
performance of individual trajectories. We first define the Bellman operator
for the time-average growth rate. We then show that, under multiplicative
reward dynamics, the geometric mean aligns with the time-average growth rate.
To address more general and unknown reward dynamics, we propose a modified
geometric mean with $N$-sliding window that captures the path-dependency as an
estimator for the time-average growth rate. This estimator is embedded as a
regularizer into the objective, forming a practical algorithm and enabling the
policy to benefit from ensemble average and time-average simultaneously. We
evaluate our algorithm in challenging simulations, where it outperforms
conventional RL methods.

Motivation: 随着图数据规模扩大，双曲空间等黎曼流形数据空间受到关注。传统NML主要在欧几里得空间中定义，且依赖于坐标系选择，难以扩展到黎曼流形。

Method: 定义了反映黎曼流形几何结构的新NML（Rm-NML），扩展了现有NML计算技术到黎曼流形设置，并推导了在黎曼对称空间上简化计算的方法。

Result: 提出的Rm-NML具有坐标变换不变性，在欧几里得空间中与常规NML一致，并在双曲空间上的正态分布中进行了实际计算验证。

Conclusion: Rm-NML成功将NML扩展到黎曼流形，为具有层次结构的图数据提供了新的模型选择工具，特别是在双曲空间等对称空间上具有实用价值。

Abstract: In recent years, with the large-scale expansion of graph data, there has been
an increased focus on Riemannian manifold data spaces other than Euclidean
space. In particular, the development of hyperbolic spaces has been remarkable,
and they have high expressive power for graph data with hierarchical
structures. Normalized Maximum Likelihood (NML) is employed in regret
minimization and model selection. However, existing formulations of NML have
been developed primarily in Euclidean spaces and are inherently dependent on
the choice of coordinate systems, making it non-trivial to extend NML to
Riemannian manifolds. In this study, we define a new NML that reflects the
geometric structure of Riemannian manifolds, called the Riemannian manifold NML
(Rm-NML). This Rm-NML is invariant under coordinate transformations and
coincides with the conventional NML under the natural parameterization in
Euclidean space. We extend existing computational techniques for NML to the
setting of Riemannian manifolds. Furthermore, we derive a method to simplify
the computation of Rm-NML on Riemannian symmetric spaces, which encompass data
spaces of growing interest such as hyperbolic spaces. To illustrate the
practical application of our proposed method, we explicitly computed the Rm-NML
for normal distributions on hyperbolic spaces.

Abstract: Recent advances in Structure-based Drug Design (SBDD) have leveraged
generative models for 3D molecular generation, predominantly evaluating model
performance by binding affinity to target proteins. However, practical drug
discovery necessitates high binding affinity along with synthetic feasibility
and selectivity, critical properties that were largely neglected in previous
evaluations. To address this gap, we identify fundamental limitations of
conventional diffusion-based generative models in effectively guiding molecule
generation toward these diverse pharmacological properties. We propose CByG, a
novel framework extending Bayesian Flow Network into a gradient-based
conditional generative model that robustly integrates property-specific
guidance. Additionally, we introduce a comprehensive evaluation scheme
incorporating practical benchmarks for binding affinity, synthetic feasibility,
and selectivity, overcoming the limitations of conventional evaluation methods.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed CByG framework
significantly outperforms baseline models across multiple essential evaluation
criteria, highlighting its effectiveness and practicality for real-world drug
discovery applications.

Abstract: Uncertainty quantification in reinforcement learning can greatly improve
exploration and robustness. Approximate Bayesian approaches have recently been
popularized to quantify uncertainty in model-free algorithms. However, so far
the focus has been on improving the accuracy of the posterior approximation,
instead of studying the accuracy of the prior and likelihood assumptions
underlying the posterior. In this work, we demonstrate that there is a cold
posterior effect in Bayesian deep Q-learning, where contrary to theory,
performance increases when reducing the temperature of the posterior. To
identify and overcome likely causes, we challenge common assumptions made on
the likelihood and priors in Bayesian model-free algorithms. We empirically
study prior distributions and show through statistical tests that the common
Gaussian likelihood assumption is frequently violated. We argue that developing
more suitable likelihoods and priors should be a key focus in future Bayesian
reinforcement learning research and we offer simple, implementable solutions
for better priors in deep Q-learning that lead to more performant Bayesian
algorithms.

Result: 实验证明误校准网络有时优于校准网络，失败预测能更好地反映样本排序变化，与效率改进呈强相关

Conclusion: 失败预测比传统校准方法更适合作为设计和评估早期退出模型的基础，能更可靠地指导模型优化

Abstract: Early-exit models speed up inference by attaching internal classifiers to
intermediate layers of the model and allowing computation to stop once a
prediction satisfies an exit criterion. Most early-exit methods rely on
confidence-based exit strategies, which motivated some works to calibrate
intermediate classifiers to improve the performance of the entire model. In
this paper, we show that calibration measures can be misleading indicators of
the performance of multi-exit models: a well-calibrated classifier may still
waste computation, and common calibration methods do not preserve the sample
ranking within a classifier. We demonstrate empirical cases where miscalibrated
networks outperform calibrated ones. As an alternative, we propose to use
failure prediction as a more useful proxy for early-exit model performance.
Unlike calibration, failure prediction accounts for changes in the ranking of
samples and shows a strong correlation with efficiency improvements, making it
a more dependable basis for designing and evaluating early-exit models.

Motivation: 传统基于Transformer的强化学习代理依赖密集矩阵运算，能耗高，不适合能源受限的边缘平台。脉冲神经网络具有超低功耗特性，但之前的工作未能将脉冲动力学与回报条件序列建模无缝结合。

Method: 在每个自注意力块中嵌入Leaky Integrate-and-Fire神经元，通过替代梯度进行端到端训练，包含生物启发的三因子可塑性、相移脉冲位置编码和轻量级树突路由模块。

Result: 在经典控制基准测试中匹配或超越标准Decision Transformer性能，同时每个决策发射少于10个脉冲，能耗降低超过4个数量级。

Conclusion: SNN-DT通过将序列建模与神经形态效率相结合，为嵌入式可穿戴设备开辟了实时低功耗控制的途径。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning agents based on Transformer architectures have
achieved impressive performance on sequential decision-making tasks, but their
reliance on dense matrix operations makes them ill-suited for
energy-constrained, edge-oriented platforms. Spiking neural networks promise
ultra-low-power, event-driven inference, yet no prior work has seamlessly
merged spiking dynamics with return-conditioned sequence modeling. We present
the Spiking Decision Transformer (SNN-DT), which embeds Leaky
Integrate-and-Fire neurons into each self-attention block, trains end-to-end
via surrogate gradients, and incorporates biologically inspired three-factor
plasticity, phase-shifted spike-based positional encodings, and a lightweight
dendritic routing module. Our implementation matches or exceeds standard
Decision Transformer performance on classic control benchmarks (CartPole-v1,
MountainCar-v0, Acrobot-v1, Pendulum-v1) while emitting fewer than ten spikes
per decision, an energy proxy suggesting over four orders-of-magnitude
reduction in per inference energy. By marrying sequence modeling with
neuromorphic efficiency, SNN-DT opens a pathway toward real-time, low-power
control on embedded and wearable devices.

Result: 序列化格式选择显著影响LLMs的性能和公平性，GReat和LIFT等格式获得更高F1分数但加剧公平性差距，ICL相比零样本基线提升性能4.9-59.6%，但对公平性的影响因数据集而异

Conclusion: 需要有效的表格数据表示方法和公平性感知模型来提高LLMs在金融决策中的可靠性

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly employed in high-stakes
decision-making tasks, such as loan approvals. While their applications expand
across domains, LLMs struggle to process tabular data, ensuring fairness and
delivering reliable predictions. In this work, we assess the performance and
fairness of LLMs on serialized loan approval datasets from three geographically
distinct regions: Ghana, Germany, and the United States. Our evaluation focuses
on the model's zero-shot and in-context learning (ICL) capabilities. Our
results reveal that the choice of serialization (Serialization refers to the
process of converting tabular data into text formats suitable for processing by
LLMs.) format significantly affects both performance and fairness in LLMs, with
certain formats such as GReat and LIFT yielding higher F1 scores but
exacerbating fairness disparities. Notably, while ICL improved model
performance by 4.9-59.6% relative to zero-shot baselines, its effect on
fairness varied considerably across datasets. Our work underscores the
importance of effective tabular data representation methods and fairness-aware
models to improve the reliability of LLMs in financial decision-making.

Motivation: GNN在解决布尔可满足性问题(SAT)时，面对困难实例性能急剧下降，作者希望探究这是否反映了GNN架构的根本局限性。

Method: 使用图里奇曲率(RC)作为几何分析工具，量化图的局部连接瓶颈；理论证明随机k-SAT公式的二分图具有负曲率特性；通过实验验证曲率与问题难度及GNN性能的关系。

Result: 发现SAT实例难度与图曲率负相关，曲率是问题复杂度的强指标，并能预测GNN性能；确认GNN存在oversquashing现象，长程依赖难以压缩到固定长度表示中。

Conclusion: 图曲率提供了理解GNN在SAT问题上局限性的几何解释，为现有求解器设计原则提供了理论支持，并指出了未来改进方向。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have recently shown promise as solvers for
Boolean Satisfiability Problems (SATs) by operating on graph representations of
logical formulas. However, their performance degrades sharply on harder
instances, raising the question of whether this reflects fundamental
architectural limitations. In this work, we provide a geometric explanation
through the lens of graph Ricci Curvature (RC), which quantifies local
connectivity bottlenecks. We prove that bipartite graphs derived from random
k-SAT formulas are inherently negatively curved, and that this curvature
decreases with instance difficulty. Building on this, we show that GNN-based
SAT solvers are affected by oversquashing, a phenomenon where long-range
dependencies become impossible to compress into fixed-length representations.
We validate our claims empirically across different SAT benchmarks and confirm
that curvature is both a strong indicator of problem complexity and can be used
to predict performance. Finally, we connect our findings to design principles
of existing solvers and outline promising directions for future work.

Conclusion: 虽然数据最小化在技术上可行，但实际应用仍面临挑战，其效果依赖于技术设置和用户特征，使得制定通用的数据"必要性"标准很困难。

Abstract: Data minimization is a legal principle requiring personal data processing to
be limited to what is necessary for a specified purpose. Operationalizing this
principle for recommender systems, which rely on extensive personal data,
remains a significant challenge. This paper conducts a feasibility study on
minimizing implicit feedback inference data for such systems. We propose a
novel problem formulation, analyze various minimization techniques, and
investigate key factors influencing their effectiveness. We demonstrate that
substantial inference data reduction is technically feasible without
significant performance loss. However, its practicality is critically
determined by two factors: the technical setting (e.g., performance targets,
choice of model) and user characteristics (e.g., history size, preference
complexity). Thus, while we establish its technical feasibility, we conclude
that data minimization remains practically challenging and its dependence on
the technical and user context makes a universal standard for data `necessity'
difficult to implement.

Abstract: We introduce a novel wearable textile-garment featuring an innovative

enhancing signal fidelity in Electrocardiography (ECG) recordings. We present a
comprehensive, sex-balanced evaluation involving 15 healthy males and 15

anatomical and physiological variations. The assessment framework encompasses
distinct evaluation approaches: quantitative signal quality indices to
objectively benchmark device performance; rhythm-based analyzes of
physiological parameters such as heart rate and heart rate variability; machine
learning classification tasks to assess application-relevant predictive
utility; morphological analysis of ECG features including amplitude and
interval parameters; and investigations of the effects of electrode projection
angle given by the textile / body shape, with all analyzes stratified by sex to
elucidate sex-specific influences. Evaluations were conducted across various
activity phases representing real-world conditions. The results demonstrate
that the textile system achieves signal quality highly concordant with

Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) present a transformative approach
for smart grid modeling by integrating physical laws directly into learning
frameworks, addressing critical challenges of data scarcity and physical
consistency in conventional data-driven methods. This paper evaluates PINNs'
capabilities as surrogate models for smart grid dynamics, comparing their
performance against XGBoost, Random Forest, and Linear Regression across three
key experiments: interpolation, cross-validation, and episodic trajectory
prediction. By training PINNs exclusively through physics-based loss functions
(enforcing power balance, operational constraints, and grid stability) we
demonstrate their superior generalization, outperforming data-driven models in
error reduction. Notably, PINNs maintain comparatively lower MAE in dynamic
grid operations, reliably capturing state transitions in both random and
expert-driven control scenarios, while traditional models exhibit erratic
performance. Despite slight degradation in extreme operational regimes, PINNs
consistently enforce physical feasibility, proving vital for safety-critical
applications. Our results contribute to establishing PINNs as a
paradigm-shifting tool for smart grid surrogation, bridging data-driven
flexibility with first-principles rigor. This work advances real-time grid
control and scalable digital twins, emphasizing the necessity of physics-aware
architectures in mission-critical energy systems.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Recent studies show the promise of large language models (LLMs) for few-shot
tabular classification but highlight challenges due to the variability in
structured data. To address this, we propose distilling data into actionable
insights to enable robust and effective classification by LLMs. Drawing
inspiration from human learning processes, we introduce InsightTab, an insight
distillation framework guided by principles of divide-and-conquer, easy-first,
and reflective learning. Our approach integrates rule summarization, strategic
exemplification, and insight reflection through deep collaboration between LLMs
and data modeling techniques. The obtained insights enable LLMs to better align
their general knowledge and capabilities with the particular requirements of
specific tabular tasks. We extensively evaluate InsightTab on nine datasets.
The results demonstrate consistent improvement over state-of-the-art methods.
Ablation studies further validate the principle-guided distillation process,
while analyses emphasize InsightTab's effectiveness in leveraging labeled data
and managing bias.

Method: 提出了OceAn Salinity Imputation System (OASIS)，一种扩散对抗框架

Conclusion: OASIS框架旨在解决海洋盐度测量中的挑战，提供更好的数据填补方法

Abstract: Ocean salinity plays a vital role in circulation, climate, and marine
ecosystems, yet its measurement is often sparse, irregular, and noisy,
especially in drifter-based datasets. Traditional approaches, such as remote
sensing and optimal interpolation, rely on linearity and stationarity, and are
limited by cloud cover, sensor drift, and low satellite revisit rates. While
machine learning models offer flexibility, they often fail under severe
sparsity and lack principled ways to incorporate physical covariates without
specialized sensors. In this paper, we introduce the OceAn Salinity Imputation
System (OASIS), a novel diffusion adversarial framework designed to address
these challenges.

Abstract: Physics informed neural networks (PINNs) represent a very popular class of
neural solvers for partial differential equations. In practice, one often
employs stochastic gradient descent type algorithms to train the neural
network. Therefore, the convergence guarantee of stochastic gradient descent is
of fundamental importance. In this work, we establish the linear convergence of
stochastic gradient descent / flow in training over-parameterized two layer
PINNs for a general class of activation functions in the sense of high
probability. These results extend the existing result [18] in which gradient
descent was analyzed. The challenge of the analysis lies in handling the
dynamic randomness introduced by stochastic optimization methods. The key of
the analysis lies in ensuring the positive definiteness of suitable Gram
matrices during the training. The analysis sheds insight into the dynamics of
the optimization process, and provides guarantees on the neural networks
trained by stochastic algorithms.

Abstract: Decision theories offer principled methods for making choices under various
types of uncertainty. Algorithms that implement these theories have been
successfully applied to a wide range of real-world problems, including
materials and drug discovery. Indeed, they are desirable since they can
adaptively gather information to make better decisions in the future, resulting
in data-efficient workflows. In scientific discovery, where experiments are
costly, these algorithms can thus significantly reduce the cost of
experimentation. Theoretical analyses of these algorithms are crucial for
understanding their behavior and providing valuable insights for developing
next-generation algorithms. However, theoretical analyses in the literature are
often inaccessible to non-experts. This monograph aims to provide an
accessible, self-contained introduction to the theoretical analysis of commonly
used probabilistic decision-making algorithms, including bandit algorithms,
Bayesian optimization, and tree search algorithms. Only basic knowledge of
probability theory and statistics, along with some elementary knowledge about
Gaussian processes, is assumed.

Result: 模型在点赞预测上达到R²=0.98的高准确率，但评论预测仅为R²=0.41，显示点赞主要受情感和曝光度影响，而评论需要更多未包含的因素

Conclusion: 情感和时间特征结合现有查看数据可有效预测社交互动，但不同互动类型有不同的驱动机制，评论预测需要更多未包含的特征

Abstract: We present a machine learning approach for predicting social media engagement
(comments and likes) from emotional and temporal features. The dataset contains
600 songs with annotations for valence, arousal, and related sentiment metrics.
A multi target regression model based on HistGradientBoostingRegressor is
trained on log transformed engagement ratios to address skewed targets.
Performance is evaluated with both a custom order of magnitude accuracy and
standard regression metrics, including the coefficient of determination (R^2).
Results show that emotional and temporal metadata, together with existing view
counts, predict future engagement effectively. The model attains R^2 = 0.98 for
likes but only R^2 = 0.41 for comments. This gap indicates that likes are
largely driven by readily captured affective and exposure signals, whereas
comments depend on additional factors not represented in the current feature
set.

Method: 使用奇异值分解(SVD)将分类头权重矩阵分解，获得决定性和非关键子空间；远离OOD时使用非关键子空间，近距离OOD时使用决定性子空间

Result: 在多个标准OOD测试集上达到了最先进的结果

Conclusion: ActSub方法通过智能地选择正确的子空间，根据分布偏移程度优化OOD检测性能

Abstract: To ensure the reliability of deep models in real-world applications,
out-of-distribution (OOD) detection methods aim to distinguish samples close to
the training distribution (in-distribution, ID) from those farther away (OOD).
In this work, we propose a novel OOD detection method that utilizes singular
value decomposition of the weight matrix of the classification head to
decompose the model's activations into decisive and insignificant components,
which contribute maximally, respectively minimally, to the final classifier
output. We find that the subspace of insignificant components more effectively
distinguishes ID from OOD data than raw activations in regimes of large
distribution shifts (Far-OOD). This occurs because the classification objective
leaves the insignificant subspace largely unaffected, yielding features that
are ''untainted'' by the target classification task. Conversely, in regimes of
smaller distribution shifts (Near-OOD), we find that activation shaping methods
profit from only considering the decisive subspace, as the insignificant
component can cause interference in the activation space. By combining two
findings into a single approach, termed ActSub, we achieve state-of-the-art
results in various standard OOD benchmarks.

Conclusion: 断点预测为估计未来或假设事件对特定社区的异质性影响提供了新的可能性。

Abstract: Estimating community-specific mental health effects of local events is vital
for public health policy. While forecasting mental health scores alone offers
limited insights into the impact of events on community well-being,
quasi-experimental designs like the Longitudinal Regression Discontinuity
Design (LRDD) from econometrics help researchers derive more effects that are
more likely to be causal from observational data. LRDDs aim to extrapolate the
size of changes in an outcome (e.g. a discontinuity in running scores for
anxiety) due to a time-specific event. Here, we propose adapting LRDDs beyond
traditional forecasting into a statistical learning framework whereby future
discontinuities (i.e. time-specific shifts) and changes in slope (i.e. linear
trajectories) are estimated given a location's history of the score, dynamic
covariates (other running assessments), and exogenous variables (static
representations). Applying our framework to predict discontinuities in the
anxiety of US counties from COVID-19 events, we found the task was difficult
but more achievable as the sophistication of models was increased, with the
best results coming from integrating exogenous and dynamic covariates. Our
approach shows strong improvement ($r=+.46$ for discontinuity and $r = +.65$
for slope) over traditional static community representations. Discontinuity
forecasting raises new possibilities for estimating the idiosyncratic effects
of potential future or hypothetical events on specific communities.

Conclusion: UniMLR通过利用正标签排序信息，成功统一了多标签排序中的排序和分类任务，为多标签学习提供了新的研究范式。

Abstract: Existing multi-label ranking (MLR) frameworks only exploit information
deduced from the bipartition of labels into positive and negative sets.
Therefore, they do not benefit from ranking among positive labels, which is the
novel MLR approach we introduce in this paper. We propose UniMLR, a new MLR
paradigm that models implicit class relevance/significance values as
probability distributions using the ranking among positive labels, rather than
treating them as equally important. This approach unifies ranking and
classification tasks associated with MLR. Additionally, we address the
challenges of scarcity and annotation bias in MLR datasets by introducing eight
synthetic datasets (Ranked MNISTs) generated with varying
significance-determining factors, providing an enriched and controllable
experimental environment. We statistically demonstrate that our method
accurately learns a representation of the positive rank order, which is
consistent with the ground truth and proportional to the underlying
significance values. Finally, we conduct comprehensive empirical experiments on
both real-world and synthetic datasets, demonstrating the value of our proposed
framework.

Abstract: Heart rate prediction is vital for personalized health monitoring and
fitness, while it frequently faces a critical challenge when deploying in
real-world: data heterogeneity. We classify it in two key dimensions: source
heterogeneity from fragmented device markets with varying feature sets, and
user heterogeneity reflecting distinct physiological patterns across
individuals and activities. Existing methods either discard device-specific
information, or fail to model user-specific differences, limiting their
real-world performance. To address this, we propose a framework that learns
latent representations agnostic to both heterogeneity, enabling downstream
predictors to work consistently under heterogeneous data patterns.
Specifically, we introduce a random feature dropout strategy to handle source
heterogeneity, making the model robust to various feature sets. To manage user
heterogeneity, we employ a time-aware attention module to capture long-term
physiological traits and use a contrastive learning objective to build a
discriminative representation space. To reflect the heterogeneous nature of
real-world data, we created and publicly released a new benchmark dataset,
ParroTao. Evaluations on both ParroTao and the public FitRec dataset show that
our model significantly outperforms existing baselines by 17% and 15%,
respectively. Furthermore, analysis of the learned representations demonstrates
their strong discriminative power, and one downstream application task confirm
the practical value of our model.

Motivation: 现实医疗环境中多模态数据（EHR、临床笔记、医学影像）往往不完整或变化多样，现有方法需要完整模态数据或依赖人工选择策略，限制了在真实临床环境中的应用。

Method: 提出MoE-Health框架，采用专门化的专家网络和动态门控机制，根据可用数据模态动态选择和组合相关专家，实现灵活适应不同数据可用性场景。

Result: 在MIMIC-IV数据集上的三个关键临床预测任务（院内死亡率预测、长期住院预测、再入院预测）中，MoE-Health相比现有多模态融合方法表现更优，并在不同模态可用性模式下保持鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该框架有效整合多模态信息，提供改进的预测性能和鲁棒性，特别适合部署在数据可用性异质的多样化医疗环境中。

Abstract: Healthcare systems generate diverse multimodal data, including Electronic
Health Records (EHR), clinical notes, and medical images. Effectively
leveraging this data for clinical prediction is challenging, particularly as
real-world samples often present with varied or incomplete modalities. Existing
approaches typically require complete modality data or rely on manual selection
strategies, limiting their applicability in real-world clinical settings where
data availability varies across patients and institutions. To address these
limitations, we propose MoE-Health, a novel Mixture of Experts framework
designed for robust multimodal fusion in healthcare prediction. MoE-Health
architecture is specifically developed to handle samples with differing
modalities and improve performance on critical clinical tasks. By leveraging
specialized expert networks and a dynamic gating mechanism, our approach
dynamically selects and combines relevant experts based on available data
modalities, enabling flexible adaptation to varying data availability
scenarios. We evaluate MoE-Health on the MIMIC-IV dataset across three critical
clinical prediction tasks: in-hospital mortality prediction, long length of
stay, and hospital readmission prediction. Experimental results demonstrate
that MoE-Health achieves superior performance compared to existing multimodal
fusion methods while maintaining robustness across different modality
availability patterns. The framework effectively integrates multimodal
information, offering improved predictive performance and robustness in
handling heterogeneous and incomplete healthcare data, making it particularly
suitable for deployment in diverse healthcare environments with heterogeneous
data availability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准LoRA需要学习两个更新矩阵，而基于SVD的变体计算成本高且奇异向量难以解释，需要更高效和结构化的参数高效微调方法

Method: 使用带列主元的QR分解从预训练权重矩阵中提取正交基，将LoRA更新表示为这些基向量的线性组合，仅训练标量系数

Result: 在GLUE任务上，QR-LoRA仅用601个参数就能达到或超过全微调、标准LoRA和SVD-LoRA的性能，参数减少1000倍以上

Conclusion: QR-LoRA通过正交基分解提供了结构化且参数极少的微调方案，在保持性能的同时大幅降低了计算和存储需求

Abstract: The growing scale of Large Language Models (LLMs) has necessitated the
development of parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques. Low-Rank Adaptation
(LoRA) has emerged as a promising approach, reducing the number of trainable
parameters by applying low-rank updates to pretrained weights. While standard
LoRA learns both update factors directly, several recent variants first
initialize those matrices via an SVD of the pretrained weights -- an operation
that can be expensive on large models and yields singular vectors that are not
always easy to interpret. In this work, we extract an orthonormal basis from
the pretrained weight matrix using QR decomposition with column pivoting, and
then express the LoRA update as a linear combination of these basis vectors --
training only the scalar coefficients, which imposes clear structure on
adaptation and drastically reduces parameter count. Experiments across GLUE
tasks show that QR-LoRA matches or exceeds the performance of full fine-tuning,
standard LoRA, and SVD-LoRA (LoRA with update matrices initialized via singular
value decomposition) with as few as 601 parameters -- a reduction of over 1000x
compared to full fine-tuning and 77x fewer than typical LoRA setups.

Abstract: As privacy regulations such as the GDPR and HIPAA and responsibility
frameworks for artificial intelligence such as the AI Act gain traction, the
ethical and responsible use of real-world data faces increasing constraints.
Synthetic data generation has emerged as a promising solution to risk-aware
data sharing and model development, particularly for tabular datasets that are
foundational to sensitive domains such as healthcare. To address both privacy
and fairness concerns in this setting, we propose FLIP (Fair Latent
Intervention under Privacy guarantees), a transformer-based variational
autoencoder augmented with latent diffusion to generate heterogeneous tabular
data. Unlike the typical setup in fairness-aware data generation, we assume a
task-agnostic setup, not reliant on a fixed, defined downstream task, thus
offering broader applicability. To ensure privacy, FLIP employs R\'enyi
differential privacy (RDP) constraints during training and addresses fairness
in the input space with RDP-compatible balanced sampling that accounts for
group-specific noise levels across multiple sampling rates. In the latent
space, we promote fairness by aligning neuron activation patterns across
protected groups using Centered Kernel Alignment (CKA), a similarity measure
extending the Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion (HSIC). This alignment
encourages statistical independence between latent representations and the
protected feature. Empirical results demonstrate that FLIP effectively provides
significant fairness improvements for task-agnostic fairness and across diverse
downstream tasks under differential privacy constraints.
