### [1] [RAG for Geoscience: What We Expect, Gaps and Opportunities](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11246)
*Runlong Yu,Shiyuan Luo,Rahul Ghosh,Lingyao Li,Yiqun Xie,Xiaowei Jia*

Main category: cs.ET

TL;DR: Geo-RAG提出了一种改进的检索增强生成（RAG）范式，针对地球科学任务，通过多模态数据检索、领域约束推理、科学级生成和验证，提升透明度和可信度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前RAG方法以文本为中心，难以满足地球科学任务对多模态数据和领域约束的需求。

Method: Geo-RAG采用模块化的检索→推理→生成→验证循环，支持多模态数据检索、领域约束推理、科学级生成和验证。

Result: Geo-RAG为地球科学工作流提供了更透明和可信的解决方案。

Conclusion: Geo-RAG通过改进RAG范式，为地球科学任务提供了更强大的支持。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances language models by combining
retrieval with generation. However, its current workflow remains largely
text-centric, limiting its applicability in geoscience. Many geoscientific
tasks are inherently evidence-hungry. Typical examples involve imputing missing
observations using analog scenes, retrieving equations and parameters to
calibrate models, geolocating field photos based on visual cues, or surfacing
historical case studies to support policy analyses. A simple
``retrieve-then-generate'' pipeline is insufficient for these needs. We
envision Geo-RAG, a next-generation paradigm that reimagines RAG as a modular
retrieve $\rightarrow$ reason $\rightarrow$ generate $\rightarrow$ verify loop.
Geo-RAG supports four core capabilities: (i) retrieval of multi-modal Earth
data; (ii) reasoning under physical and domain constraints; (iii) generation of
science-grade artifacts; and (iv) verification of generated hypotheses against
numerical models, ground measurements, and expert assessments. This shift opens
new opportunities for more trustworthy and transparent geoscience workflows.

### [2] [Banking 2.0: The Stablecoin Banking Revolution -- How Digital Assets Are Reshaping Global Finance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11395)
*Kevin McNamara,Rhea Pritham Marpu*

Main category: cs.ET

TL;DR: 稳定币是银行业自放弃金本位以来最重要的演进，有望通过整合加密货币与传统金融基础设施实现“银行2.0”，解决现代法定货币的脆弱性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代法定货币依赖机构信任而非实物支持，存在脆弱性。稳定币通过增强稳定性、降低欺诈风险和统一全球交易来解决这些问题。

Method: 分析稳定币的加速机构采用（如美国GENIUS法案、摩根大通的加密贷款、PayPal的加密支付服务），探讨其宏观经济影响。

Result: 稳定币通过多样化支持机制解决通胀与生产力差距，促进金融系统去监管和效率提升。

Conclusion: 稳定币有望重塑银行业，推动更互联的国际金融体系。

Abstract: The global financial system stands at an inflection point. Stablecoins
represent the most significant evolution in banking since the abandonment of
the gold standard, positioned to enable "Banking 2.0" by seamlessly integrating
cryptocurrency innovation with traditional finance infrastructure. This
transformation rivals artificial intelligence as the next major disruptor in
the financial sector. Modern fiat currencies derive value entirely from
institutional trust rather than physical backing, creating vulnerabilities that
stablecoins address through enhanced stability, reduced fraud risk, and unified
global transactions that transcend national boundaries. Recent developments
demonstrate accelerating institutional adoption: landmark U.S. legislation
including the GENIUS Act of 2025, strategic industry pivots from major players
like JPMorgan's crypto-backed loan initiatives, and PayPal's comprehensive "Pay
with Crypto" service. Widespread stablecoin implementation addresses critical
macroeconomic imbalances, particularly the inflation-productivity gap plaguing
modern monetary systems, through more robust and diversified backing
mechanisms. Furthermore, stablecoins facilitate deregulation and efficiency
gains, paving the way for a more interconnected international financial system.
This whitepaper comprehensively explores how stablecoins are poised to reshape
banking, supported by real-world examples, current market data, and analysis of
their transformative potential.

### [3] [Open Questions about Time and Self-reference in Living Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11423)
*Samson Abramsky,Wolfgang Banzhaf,Leo S. D. Caves,Michael Levin,Penousal Machado,Charles Ofria,Susan Stepney,Roger White*

Main category: cs.ET

TL;DR: 论文探讨了生命系统的自指性和自修改特性对传统科学方法的挑战，并提出了新的理论和形式框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生命系统的主动性和自指性特性为传统科学方法带来挑战，需要新的理论框架来理解这些特性。

Method: 通过区分‘自然时间’和‘表征时间’，并结合进化、胚胎发生和变态等例子，分析生命系统如何解决自指性矛盾。

Result: 传统数学和计算形式难以建模自指系统，但域理论、共代数、遗传编程和自修改算法等新方向显示出潜力。

Conclusion: 自指性和自修改性是生命系统的核心特征，需建模以理解生命的开放性创造力，对生物学、认知科学和社会科学有广泛影响。

Abstract: Living systems exhibit a range of fundamental characteristics: they are
active, self-referential, self-modifying systems. This paper explores how these
characteristics create challenges for conventional scientific approaches and
why they require new theoretical and formal frameworks. We introduce a
distinction between 'natural time', the continuing present of physical
processes, and 'representational time', with its framework of past, present and
future that emerges with life itself. Representational time enables memory,
learning and prediction, functions of living systems essential for their
survival. Through examples from evolution, embryogenesis and metamorphosis we
show how living systems navigate the apparent contradictions arising from
self-reference as natural time unwinds self-referential loops into
developmental spirals. Conventional mathematical and computational formalisms
struggle to model self-referential and self-modifying systems without running
into paradox. We identify promising new directions for modelling
self-referential systems, including domain theory, co-algebra, genetic
programming, and self-modifying algorithms. There are broad implications for
biology, cognitive science and social sciences, because self-reference and
self-modification are not problems to be avoided but core features of living
systems that must be modelled to understand life's open-ended creativity.

### [4] [CoMoNM: A Cost Modeling Framework for Compute-Near-Memory Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11451)
*Hamid Farzaneh,Asif Ali Khan,Jeronimo Castrillon*

Main category: cs.ET

TL;DR: CoMoNM是一个通用的成本建模框架，用于快速估计CNM系统的执行时间，显著提升优化决策效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决CNM系统中优化空间探索困难的问题，避免耗时的手动标注和模拟。

Method: 提出CoMoNM框架，通过硬件无关的应用表示和目标系统规格，快速估算执行时间。

Result: 在UPMEM CNM系统和HBM-PIM模拟器上，估算误差分别低于7.80%和2.99%，速度提升七个数量级。

Conclusion: CoMoNM为CNM系统提供高效、准确的执行时间估算，显著优化编译器决策。

Abstract: Compute-Near-Memory (CNM) systems offer a promising approach to mitigate the
von Neumann bottleneck by bringing computational units closer to data. However,
optimizing for these architectures remains challenging due to their unique
hardware and programming models. Existing CNM compilers often rely on manual
programmer annotations for offloading and optimizations. Automating these
decisions by exploring the optimization space, common in CPU/GPU systems, is
difficult for CNMs as constructing and navigating the transformation space is
tedious and time consuming. This is particularly the case during system-level
design, where evaluation requires time-consuming simulations. To address this,
we present CoMoNM, a generic cost modeling framework for CNM systems for
execution time estimation in milliseconds. It takes a high-level,
hardware-agnostic application representation, target system specifications, and
a mapping specification as input and estimates the execution time for the given
application on the target CNM system. We show how CoMoNM can be seamlessly
integrated into state-of-the-art CNM compilers, providing improved offloading
decisions. Evaluation on established benchmarks for CNM shows estimation errors
within 7.80% and 2.99%, when compared to the real UPMEM CNM system and
Samsung's HBM-PIM simulator. Notably, CoMoNM delivers estimates seven orders of
magnitude faster compared to the UPMEM and HBM-PIM simulators.

### [5] [A Cooperative Game-Based Multi-Criteria Weighted Ensemble Approach for Multi-Class Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10926)
*DongSeong-Yoon*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于合作博弈的多准则投票集成方法，以解决现有集成学习中权重分配仅考虑单一评价标准的问题，并在实验中表现出优越性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有集成学习方法在权重分配时仅考虑单一评价标准，无法充分利用分类器的多种先验信息，限制了模型性能。

Method: 通过合作博弈在多准则情境下决策，同时考虑分类器的多种先验信息，实现合理的权重分配。

Result: 在Open-ML-CC18数据集上的实验表明，该方法优于其他权重分配方法。

Conclusion: 提出的多准则合作博弈方法能有效提升集成学习性能，为权重分配提供了更全面的解决方案。

Abstract: Since the Fourth Industrial Revolution, AI technology has been widely used in
many fields, but there are several limitations that need to be overcome,
including overfitting/underfitting, class imbalance, and the limitations of
representation (hypothesis space) due to the characteristics of different
models. As a method to overcome these problems, ensemble, commonly known as
model combining, is being extensively used in the field of machine learning.
Among ensemble learning methods, voting ensembles have been studied with
various weighting methods, showing performance improvements. However, the
existing methods that reflect the pre-information of classifiers in weights
consider only one evaluation criterion, which limits the reflection of various
information that should be considered in a model realistically. Therefore, this
paper proposes a method of making decisions considering various information
through cooperative games in multi-criteria situations. Using this method,
various types of information known beforehand in classifiers can be
simultaneously considered and reflected, leading to appropriate weight
distribution and performance improvement. The machine learning algorithms were
applied to the Open-ML-CC18 dataset and compared with existing ensemble
weighting methods. The experimental results showed superior performance
compared to other weighting methods.

TL;DR: Apriel-Nemotron-15B-Thinker是一个15B参数的模型，性能媲美32B参数的模型，但内存占用仅为后者的一半。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大语言模型在内存和计算成本上的高消耗问题，使其更适合企业实际应用。

Method: 采用四阶段训练流程：基础模型扩展、持续预训练、监督微调、GRPO强化学习。

Result: 在多项基准测试中，性能与32B参数模型相当或更优，同时内存占用减半。

Conclusion: Apriel-Nemotron-15B-Thinker展示了高效的小型化模型设计潜力，适合企业部署。

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable reasoning
capabilities across domains like code, math and other enterprise tasks, their
significant memory and computational costs often preclude their use in
practical enterprise settings. To this end, we introduce
Apriel-Nemotron-15B-Thinker, a 15-billion parameter model in the ServiceNow
Apriel SLM series that achieves performance against medium sized
state-of-the-art models such as o1-mini, QWQ32B, and EXAONE-Deep-32B while
maintaining only half the memory footprint of those alternatives.
Apriel-Nemotron-15B-Thinker model is trained in a four stage training pipeline
including 1) Base Model upscaling, 2) Continual Pre-training 3) Supervised
Fine-tuning (SFT) and 4) Reinforcement Learning using GRPO. Comprehensive
evaluations across a diverse suite of benchmarks consistently demonstrate that
our Apriel-Nemotron-15B-Thinker model matches or exceeds the performance of its
32-billion parameter counterparts, despite being less than half their size.

### [7] [Towards Efficient Prompt-based Continual Learning in Distributed Medical AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10954)
*Gyutae Oh,Jitae Shin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于提示的持续学习方法（PCL），用于解决医疗领域数据共享受限的问题，显著提升了分类准确率和F1分数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医疗领域的数据共享受伦理、社会和制度限制，传统集中式学习难以实现，且传统训练方法容易过拟合和遗忘旧知识。

Method: 采用统一的提示池和最小扩展策略，通过冻结部分提示减少计算开销，并引入新的正则化项平衡知识保留与适应。

Result: 在三个糖尿病视网膜病变数据集上，PCL方法比现有技术分类准确率提高至少10%，F1分数提高9分，同时降低推理成本。

Conclusion: PCL方法有望推动可持续医疗AI发展，支持实时诊断和远程医疗应用。

Abstract: Modern AI models achieve state-of-the-art performance with large-scale,
high-quality datasets; however, ethical, social, and institutional constraints
in the medical domain severely restrict data sharing, rendering centralized
learning nearly impossible. Each institution must incrementally update models
using only local data. Traditional training overfits new samples and suffers
from catastrophic forgetting, losing previously acquired knowledge. Medical
data distributions also shift due to varying diagnostic equipment and
demographics. Although continual learning (CL) has advanced, most methods
address natural images, leaving medical-domain-specific CL underexplored. We
propose a prompt-based continual learning (PCL) approach featuring a unified
prompt pool with a minimal expansion strategy: by expanding and freezing a
subset of prompts, our method reduces computational overhead, and a novel
regularization term balances retention and adaptation. Experiments on three
diabetic retinopathy datasets Aptos2019, LI2019, and Diabetic Retinopathy
Detection show our model improves final classification accuracy by at least 10%
and F1-score by 9 points over state-of-the-art approaches while lowering
inference cost. We anticipate this study will drive sustainable medical AI
advances, enabling real-time diagnosis, patient monitoring, and telemedicine
applications in distributed healthcare. Code will be released upon acceptance

*Xinyi Li,Sai Wang,Yutian Lin,Yu Wu,Yi Yang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Retro-Expert是一个可解释的逆合成预测框架，结合大型语言模型和专用模型，通过强化学习生成自然语言解释，提升预测性能和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有模型依赖静态模式匹配，缺乏逻辑决策能力，导致黑箱决策。

Method: 结合专用模型（浅层推理）、LLM（关键推理）和强化学习，生成解释性推理路径。

Result: Retro-Expert在多个指标上超越现有模型，并提供专家认可的解释。

Conclusion: Retro-Expert不仅性能优越，还通过可解释性弥合AI预测与化学洞察的差距。

Abstract: Retrosynthesis prediction aims to infer the reactant molecule based on a
given product molecule, which is a fundamental task in chemical synthesis.
However, existing models rely on static pattern-matching paradigm, which limits
their ability to perform effective logic decision-making, leading to black-box
decision-making. Building on this, we propose Retro-Expert, an interpretable
retrosynthesis framework that performs collaborative reasoning by combining the
complementary reasoning strengths of Large Language Models and specialized
models via reinforcement learning. It outputs natural language explanations
grounded in chemical logic through three components: (1) specialized models
perform shallow reasoning to construct high-quality chemical decision space,
(2) LLM-driven critical reasoning to generate predictions and corresponding
interpretable reasoning path, and (3) reinforcement learning optimizing
interpretable decision policy. Experiments show that Retro-Expert not only
surpasses both LLM-based and specialized models across different metrics but
also provides expert-aligned explanations that bridge the gap between AI
predictions and actionable chemical insights.

TL;DR: BeyondWeb是一个高质量的合成数据生成框架，显著提升了预训练性能，超越了现有合成数据集，并提供了关于合成数据优化的关键见解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大规模语言模型预训练中数据数量扩展的收益递减问题，探索合成数据的潜力。

Method: 开发BeyondWeb框架，生成高质量合成数据，并与现有数据集进行对比实验。

Result: BeyondWeb在14项基准测试中平均提升5.1和2.6个百分点，训练速度更快，小模型表现优于大模型。

Conclusion: 高质量合成数据需多因素联合优化，BeyondWeb展示了其潜力，但需科学方法和实践经验支持。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language model (LLM) pretraining have shown that
simply scaling data quantity eventually leads to diminishing returns, hitting a
data wall. In response, the use of synthetic data for pretraining has emerged
as a promising paradigm for pushing the frontier of performance. Despite this,
the factors affecting synthetic data quality remain poorly understood. In this
work, we introduce BeyondWeb, a synthetic data generation framework that
produces high-quality synthetic data for pretraining. BeyondWeb significantly
extends the capabilities of traditional web-scale datasets, outperforming
state-of-the-art synthetic pretraining datasets such as Cosmopedia and
Nemotron-CC's high-quality synthetic subset (Nemotron-Synth) by up to 5.1
percentage points (pp) and 2.6pp, respectively, when averaged across a suite of
14 benchmark evaluations. It delivers up to 7.7x faster training than open web
data and 2.7x faster than Nemotron-Synth. Remarkably, a 3B model trained for
180B tokens on BeyondWeb outperforms an 8B model trained for the same token
budget on Cosmopedia. We also present several insights from BeyondWeb on
synthetic data for pretraining: what drives its benefits, which data to
rephrase and how, and the impact of model size and family on data quality.
Overall, our work shows that there's no silver bullet for generating
high-quality synthetic pretraining data. The best outcomes require jointly
optimizing many factors, a challenging task that requires rigorous science and
practical expertise. Naive approaches can yield modest improvements,
potentially at great cost, while well-executed methods can yield transformative
improvements, as exemplified by BeyondWeb.

### [10] [Match & Choose: Model Selection Framework for Fine-tuning Text-to-Image Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10993)
*Basile Lewandowski,Robert Birke,Lydia Y. Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了M&C框架，帮助用户从模型平台中选择最适合目标数据域的预训练T2I模型，避免逐一微调。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 公开的预训练T2I模型虽促进了模型民主化，但用户面临选择最佳模型的挑战，目前缺乏相关研究。

Method: M&C框架通过匹配图（包含模型和数据节点及其关系）和图嵌入特征，预测微调后性能最佳的模型。

Result: 在10个T2I模型和32个数据集上的实验表明，M&C能准确预测61.3%的最佳模型，其余情况下也能选出接近最优的模型。

Conclusion: M&C为预训练T2I模型选择提供了高效解决方案，显著减少了微调成本。

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) models based on diffusion and transformer architectures
advance rapidly. They are often pretrained on large corpora, and openly shared
on a model platform, such as HuggingFace. Users can then build up AI
applications, e.g., generating media contents, by adopting pretrained T2I
models and fine-tuning them on the target dataset. While public pretrained T2I
models facilitate the democratization of the models, users face a new
challenge: which model can be best fine-tuned based on the target data domain?
Model selection is well addressed in classification tasks, but little is known
in (pretrained) T2I models and their performance indication on the target
domain. In this paper, we propose the first model selection framework, M&C,
which enables users to efficiently choose a pretrained T2I model from a model
platform without exhaustively fine-tuning them all on the target dataset. The
core of M&C is a matching graph, which consists of: (i) nodes of available
models and profiled datasets, and (ii) edges of model-data and data-data pairs
capturing the fine-tuning performance and data similarity, respectively. We
then build a model that, based on the inputs of model/data feature, and,
critically, the graph embedding feature, extracted from the matching graph,
predicts the model achieving the best quality after fine-tuning for the target
domain. We evaluate M&C on choosing across ten T2I models for 32 datasets
against three baselines. Our results show that M&C successfully predicts the
best model for fine-tuning in 61.3% of the cases and a closely performing model
for the rest.

TL;DR: CURE框架通过两阶段方法（高熵关键令牌再生和静态初始状态采样）解决RLVR中的熵崩溃问题，提升LLM的推理能力和多样性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RLVR方法因静态初始状态采样导致熵崩溃和低多样性行为，限制了模型性能的持续提升。

Method: CURE采用两阶段框架：第一阶段通过高熵关键令牌再生优化探索，第二阶段通过DAPO静态采样强化利用。

Result: 在Qwen-2.5-Math-7B上，CURE在六个数学基准测试中性能提升5%，同时在熵和准确性上达到SOTA。

Conclusion: CURE有效平衡探索与利用，显著提升模型性能和多样性，代码已开源。

Abstract: Recent advances in Reinforcement Learning with Verified Reward (RLVR) have
driven the emergence of more sophisticated cognitive behaviors in large
language models (LLMs), thereby enhancing their reasoning capabilities.
However, in prior RLVR pipelines, the repeated use of static initial-state
sampling drawn exactly from the dataset distribution during each sampling phase
produced overly deterministic, low diversity model behavior, which manifested
as rapid entropy collapse and hindered sustained performance gains during
prolonged training. To address this issue, we introduce CURE
(Critical-token-gUided Re concatenation for Entropy-collapse prevention), a
two-stage framework that balances exploration and exploitation. Specifically,
in the first stage, to deliberately steer the model toward novel yet coherent
contexts, we re-generate at high-entropy critical tokens and jointly optimize
the original and the branched trajectories. The further comparison with vanilla
DAPO shows that the regeneration process achieves a better performance on math
reasoning tasks while sustaining a high-level entropy degree for exploration.
In the second stage, we continue training with static initial-state sampling by
DAPO, intentionally placing the model in a familiar state to gradually
strengthen exploitation. Extensive experiments on Qwen-2.5-Math-7B show that,
compared to other RLVR methods, CURE achieves a 5% performance gain across six
math benchmarks, establishing state-of-the-art performance in both entropy and
accuracy. A series of experiments further validate the effectiveness of our
approach. Code is available at https://github.com/CURE-Project/CURE.

TL;DR: 论文通过量化设置扩展了强彩票假设（SLTH），证明了在有限精度网络中，目标离散神经网络可以被精确表示，并给出了初始网络过参数化的最优界限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 量化是提高神经网络效率的关键技术，但理论理解有限。此前工作主要集中在连续设置，无法直接应用于量化设置。

Method: 基于Borgs等人的数划分问题结果，推导量化设置下的随机子集和问题新理论，并扩展SLTH框架到有限精度网络。

Result: 在量化设置中，目标离散神经网络可被精确表示，且初始网络的过参数化界限是最优的。

Conclusion: 研究填补了量化神经网络理论空白，为高效网络设计提供了新理论支持。

Abstract: Quantization is an essential technique for making neural networks more
efficient, yet our theoretical understanding of it remains limited. Previous
works demonstrated that extremely low-precision networks, such as binary
networks, can be constructed by pruning large, randomly-initialized networks,
and showed that the ratio between the size of the original and the pruned
networks is at most polylogarithmic.
  The specific pruning method they employed inspired a line of theoretical work
known as the Strong Lottery Ticket Hypothesis (SLTH), which leverages insights
from the Random Subset Sum Problem. However, these results primarily address
the continuous setting and cannot be applied to extend SLTH results to the
quantized setting.
  In this work, we build on foundational results by Borgs et al. on the Number
Partitioning Problem to derive new theoretical results for the Random Subset
Sum Problem in a quantized setting.
  Using these results, we then extend the SLTH framework to finite-precision
networks. While prior work on SLTH showed that pruning allows approximation of
a certain class of neural networks, we demonstrate that, in the quantized
setting, the analogous class of target discrete neural networks can be
represented exactly, and we prove optimal bounds on the necessary
overparameterization of the initial network as a function of the precision of
the target network.

*Laura Lützow,Michael Eichelbeck,Mykel J. Kochenderfer,Matthias Althoff*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为zono-conformal prediction的新方法，通过构建预测zonotopes来解决传统方法计算成本高和数据依赖性强的问题，并在回归和分类任务中验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的不确定性量化方法计算成本高、数据需求大，且多维度输出依赖关系捕捉能力有限。

Method: 引入zono-conformal prediction，利用zonotopic不确定性集直接嵌入基础预测模型，通过单一线性程序实现高效识别。

Result: 实验表明，该方法比传统区间预测模型和标准conformal prediction方法更少保守，同时保持了相似的测试数据覆盖率。

Conclusion: zono-conformal prediction在计算效率和数据需求上优于现有方法，适用于非线性基础预测模型，并提供了概率覆盖保证。

Abstract: Conformal prediction is a popular uncertainty quantification method that
augments a base predictor with prediction sets with statistically valid
coverage guarantees. However, current methods are often computationally
expensive and data-intensive, as they require constructing an uncertainty model
before calibration. Moreover, existing approaches typically represent the
prediction sets with intervals, which limits their ability to capture
dependencies in multi-dimensional outputs. We address these limitations by
introducing zono-conformal prediction, a novel approach inspired by interval
predictor models and reachset-conformant identification that constructs
prediction zonotopes with assured coverage. By placing zonotopic uncertainty
sets directly into the model of the base predictor, zono-conformal predictors
can be identified via a single, data-efficient linear program. While we can
apply zono-conformal prediction to arbitrary nonlinear base predictors, we
focus on feed-forward neural networks in this work. Aside from regression
tasks, we also construct optimal zono-conformal predictors in classification
settings where the output of an uncertain predictor is a set of possible
classes. We provide probabilistic coverage guarantees and present methods for
detecting outliers in the identification data. In extensive numerical
experiments, we show that zono-conformal predictors are less conservative than
interval predictor models and standard conformal prediction methods, while
achieving a similar coverage over the test data.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种学习或更新信念中的“信心”概念，区分了它与概率或似然的不同，并给出了两种测量方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究学习或信念更新中的“信心”概念，以区分它与传统概率或似然的不同。

Method: 形式化“信心”学习的公理，提出两种连续测量方法，并证明其普适性。在附加假设下，推导出基于向量场和损失函数的紧凑表示。

Result: 证明了信心可以统一表示，并推导出基于向量场和损失函数的紧凑表示。

Conclusion: 贝叶斯规则是优化学习者在损失函数为线性期望时的特例，信心概念为学习理论提供了新视角。

Abstract: We characterize a notion of confidence that arises in learning or updating
beliefs: the amount of trust one has in incoming information and its impact on
the belief state. This learner's confidence can be used alongside (and is
easily mistaken for) probability or likelihood, but it is fundamentally a
different concept -- one that captures many familiar concepts in the
literature, including learning rates and number of training epochs, Shafer's
weight of evidence, and Kalman gain. We formally axiomatize what it means to
learn with confidence, give two canonical ways of measuring confidence on a
continuum, and prove that confidence can always be represented in this way.
Under additional assumptions, we derive more compact representations of
confidence-based learning in terms of vector fields and loss functions. These
representations induce an extended language of compound "parallel"
observations. We characterize Bayes Rule as the special case of an optimizing

Motivation: 针对非高斯分布中协方差和精度矩阵无法直接反映变量独立性的问题，研究在特定条件下（广义非正态正态分布）如何利用精度矩阵推断条件独立性。

Method: 通过高斯分布的广义对角变换定义广义非正态正态分布，提出一种计算高效的算法，利用精度矩阵恢复条件独立性结构。

Result: 合成实验和实际数据应用验证了算法的有效性。

Conclusion: 广义非正态正态分布及其算法为非高斯数据提供了条件独立性分析的新工具。

Abstract: For general non-Gaussian distributions, the covariance and precision matrices
do not encode the independence structure of the variables, as they do for the
multivariate Gaussian. This paper builds on previous work to show that for a
class of non-Gaussian distributions -- those derived from diagonal
transformations of a Gaussian -- information about the conditional independence
structure can still be inferred from the precision matrix, provided the data
meet certain criteria, analogous to the Gaussian case. We call such
transformations of the Gaussian as the generalized nonparanormal. The functions
that define these transformations are, in a broad sense, arbitrary. We also
provide a simple and computationally efficient algorithm that leverages this
theory to recover conditional independence structure from the generalized
nonparanormal data. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is demonstrated
via synthetic experiments and applications to real-world data.

Motivation: 后解释方法（如LIME和SHAP）被广泛用于评估模型偏差和泛化性，但它们易受对抗性操纵，可能掩盖有害偏差。本文旨在研究这些方法的脆弱性并探索改进策略。

Method: 复制COMPAS实验以验证先前结果，并引入模块化测试框架，系统评估增强和集成解释方法在不同性能分类器上的表现。

Result: 研究发现某些LIME/SHAP集成配置能显著提高对偏差的检测能力，优于原始方法。

Conclusion: 这些改进方法有望提升高风险机器学习系统的透明度。

Abstract: Post hoc explanation methods, such as LIME and SHAP, provide interpretable
insights into black-box classifiers and are increasingly used to assess model
biases and generalizability. However, these methods are vulnerable to
adversarial manipulation, potentially concealing harmful biases. Building on
the work of Slack et al. (2020), we investigate the susceptibility of LIME and
SHAP to biased models and evaluate strategies for improving robustness. We
first replicate the original COMPAS experiment to validate prior findings and
establish a baseline. We then introduce a modular testing framework enabling
systematic evaluation of augmented and ensemble explanation approaches across
classifiers of varying performance. Using this framework, we assess multiple
LIME/SHAP ensemble configurations on out-of-distribution models, comparing
their resistance to bias concealment against the original methods. Our results
identify configurations that substantially improve bias detection, highlighting
their potential for enhancing transparency in the deployment of high-stakes
machine learning systems.

Abstract: Microbiome sample representation to input into LLMs is essential for
downstream tasks such as phenotype prediction and environmental classification.
While prior studies have explored embedding-based representations of each
microbiome sample, most rely on simple averaging over sequence embeddings,
often overlooking the biological importance of taxa abundance. In this work, we
propose an abundance-aware variant of the Set Transformer to construct
fixed-size sample-level embeddings by weighting sequence embeddings according
to their relative abundance. Without modifying the model architecture, we
replicate embedding vectors proportional to their abundance and apply
self-attention-based aggregation. Our method outperforms average pooling and
unweighted Set Transformers on real-world microbiome classification tasks,
achieving perfect performance in some cases. These results demonstrate the
utility of abundance-aware aggregation for robust and biologically informed
microbiome representation. To the best of our knowledge, this is one of the
first approaches to integrate sequence-level abundance into Transformer-based
sample embeddings.

Result: 离线和在线实验显示，该方法在推荐准确性和鲁棒性上显著优于基线方法。

Conclusion: 提出的去偏框架有效解决了观看时间偏差问题，提升了推荐系统的性能。

Abstract: Watch time is widely used as a proxy for user satisfaction in video
recommendation platforms. However, raw watch times are influenced by
confounding factors such as video duration, popularity, and individual user
behaviors, potentially distorting preference signals and resulting in biased
recommendation models. We propose a novel relative advantage debiasing
framework that corrects watch time by comparing it to empirically derived
reference distributions conditioned on user and item groups. This approach
yields a quantile-based preference signal and introduces a two-stage
architecture that explicitly separates distribution estimation from preference
learning. Additionally, we present distributional embeddings to efficiently
parameterize watch-time quantiles without requiring online sampling or storage
of historical data. Both offline and online experiments demonstrate significant
improvements in recommendation accuracy and robustness compared to existing
baseline methods.

Conclusion: 提出的框架在速度和准确性上优于现有方法，为高效和隐私友好的学习提供了新途径。

Abstract: The rapid expansion in the size of new datasets has created a need for fast
and efficient parameter-learning techniques. Compressive learning is a
framework that enables efficient processing by using random, non-linear
features to project large-scale databases onto compact, information-preserving
representations whose dimensionality is independent of the number of samples
and can be easily stored, transferred, and processed. These database-level
summaries are then used to decode parameters of interest from the underlying
data distribution without requiring access to the original samples, offering an
efficient and privacy-friendly learning framework. However, both the encoding
and decoding techniques are typically randomized and data-independent, failing
to exploit the underlying structure of the data. In this work, we propose a
framework that meta-learns both the encoding and decoding stages of compressive
learning methods by using neural networks that provide faster and more accurate
systems than the current state-of-the-art approaches. To demonstrate the
potential of the presented Compressive Meta-Learning framework, we explore
multiple applications -- including neural network-based compressive PCA,
compressive ridge regression, compressive k-means, and autoencoders.

Result: 实验表明，该方法优于当前最先进系统，提升了早期预测性能。

Conclusion: 多模态融合和加权时间损失策略有效解决了住院初期信息有限的ICD代码预测问题。

Abstract: While the ICD code assignment problem has been widely studied, most works
have focused on post-discharge document classification. Models for early
forecasting of this information could be used for identifying health risks,
suggesting effective treatments, or optimizing resource allocation. To address
the challenge of predictive modeling using the limited information at the
beginning of a patient stay, we propose a multimodal system to fuse clinical
notes and tabular events captured in electronic health records. The model
integrates pre-trained encoders, feature pooling, and cross-modal attention to
learn optimal representations across modalities and balance their presence at
every temporal point. Moreover, we present a weighted temporal loss that
adjusts its contribution at each point in time. Experiments show that these
strategies enhance the early prediction model, outperforming the current
state-of-the-art systems.

Motivation: 时尚产业快速扩张导致用户难以找到兼容商品，现有研究常独立处理服装兼容性和个性化推荐，忽略了复杂交互。

Method: 构建用户、服装和物品的三层层次图，利用图注意力机制动态加权节点重要性，整合视觉和文本特征。

Result: 在POG数据集上，FGAT在精度、HR、召回率、NDCG和准确率上优于基线模型HFGN。

Conclusion: 结合多模态特征、层次图结构和注意力机制，能显著提升个性化时尚推荐系统的性能。

Abstract: The rapid expansion of the fashion industry and the growing variety of
products have made it challenging for users to find compatible items on
e-commerce platforms. Effective fashion recommendation systems are crucial for
filtering irrelevant items and suggesting suitable ones. However,
simultaneously addressing outfit compatibility and personalized recommendations
remains a significant challenge, as these aspects are often treated
independently in existing studies, often overlooking the complex interactions
between items and user preferences. This research introduces a new framework
named FGAT, inspired by the HFGN model, which leverages graph neural networks
and graph attention mechanisms to tackle this issue. The proposed framework
constructs a three-tier hierarchical graph of users, outfits, and items,
integrating visual and textual features to simultaneously model outfit
compatibility and user preferences. A graph attention mechanism dynamically
weights node importance during representation propagation, enabling the capture
of key interactions and generating precise representations for both user
preferences and outfit compatibility. Evaluated on the POG dataset, FGAT
outperforms baseline models such as HFGN, achieving improved results in
precision, HR, recall, NDCG, and accuracy.These results demonstrate that
combining multimodal visual-textual features with a hierarchical graph
structure and attention mechanisms significantly enhances the accuracy and
efficiency of personalized fashion recommendation systems.

Abstract: Optimization problems over discrete or quantized variables are very
challenging in general due to the combinatorial nature of their search space.
Piecewise-affine regularization (PAR) provides a flexible modeling and
computational framework for quantization based on continuous optimization. In
this work, we focus on the setting of supervised learning and investigate the
theoretical foundations of PAR from optimization and statistical perspectives.
First, we show that in the overparameterized regime, where the number of
parameters exceeds the number of samples, every critical point of the
PAR-regularized loss function exhibits a high degree of quantization. Second,
we derive closed-form proximal mappings for various (convex, quasi-convex, and
non-convex) PARs and show how to solve PAR-regularized problems using the
proximal gradient method, its accelerated variant, and the Alternating
Direction Method of Multipliers. Third, we study statistical guarantees of
PAR-regularized linear regression problems; specifically, we can approximate
classical formulations of $\ell_1$-, squared $\ell_2$-, and nonconvex
regularizations using PAR and obtain similar statistical guarantees with
quantized solutions.

Conclusion: CTRL能有效提升多源数据预测的准确性和差异性，适用于实际应用如难民安置。

Abstract: Machine learning (ML) tasks often utilize large-scale data that is drawn from
several distinct sources, such as different locations, treatment arms, or
groups. In such settings, practitioners often desire predictions that not only
exhibit good overall accuracy, but also remain reliable within each source and
preserve the differences that matter across sources. For instance, several
asylum and refugee resettlement programs now use ML-based employment
predictions to guide where newly arriving families are placed within a host
country, which requires generating informative and differentiated predictions
for many and often small source locations. However, this task is made
challenging by several common characteristics of the data in these settings:
the presence of numerous distinct data sources, distributional shifts between
them, and substantial variation in sample sizes across sources. This paper
introduces Clustered Transfer Residual Learning (CTRL), a meta-learning method
that combines the strengths of cross-domain residual learning and adaptive
pooling/clustering in order to simultaneously improve overall accuracy and
preserve source-level heterogeneity. We provide theoretical results that
clarify how our objective navigates the trade-off between data quantity and
data quality. We evaluate CTRL alongside other state-of-the-art benchmarks on 5
large-scale datasets. This includes a dataset from the national asylum program
in Switzerland, where the algorithmic geographic assignment of asylum seekers
is currently being piloted. CTRL consistently outperforms the benchmarks across
several key metrics and when using a range of different base learners.

Abstract: Bayesian network classifiers provide a feasible solution to tabular data
classification, with a number of merits like high time and memory efficiency,
and great explainability. However, due to the parameter explosion and data
sparsity issues, Bayesian network classifiers are restricted to low-order
feature dependency modeling, making them struggle in extrapolating the
occurrence probabilities of complex real-world data. In this paper, we propose
a novel paradigm to design high-order Bayesian network classifiers, by learning
distributional representations for feature values, as what has been done in
word embedding and graph representation learning. The learned distributional
representations are encoded with the semantic relatedness between different
features through their observed co-occurrence patterns in training data, which
then serve as a hallmark to extrapolate the occurrence probabilities of new
test samples. As a classifier design realization, we remake the K-dependence
Bayesian classifier (KDB) by extending it into a neural version, i.e.,
NeuralKDB, where a novel neural network architecture is designed to learn
distributional representations of feature values and parameterize the
conditional probabilities between interdependent features. A stochastic
gradient descent based algorithm is designed to train the NeuralKDB model
efficiently. Extensive classification experiments on 60 UCI datasets
demonstrate that the proposed NeuralKDB classifier excels in capturing
high-order feature dependencies and significantly outperforms the conventional
Bayesian network classifiers, as well as other competitive classifiers,
including two neural network based classifiers without distributional
representation learning.

Conclusion: QQR算法有效解决了MMO-FL中的模态不平衡问题，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: The Internet of Things (IoT) ecosystem produces massive volumes of multimodal
data from diverse sources, including sensors, cameras, and microphones. With
advances in edge intelligence, IoT devices have evolved from simple data
acquisition units into computationally capable nodes, enabling localized
processing of heterogeneous multimodal data. This evolution necessitates
distributed learning paradigms that can efficiently handle such data.
Furthermore, the continuous nature of data generation and the limited storage
capacity of edge devices demand an online learning framework. Multimodal Online
Federated Learning (MMO-FL) has emerged as a promising approach to meet these
requirements. However, MMO-FL faces new challenges due to the inherent
instability of IoT devices, which often results in modality quantity and
quality imbalance (QQI) during data collection. In this work, we systematically
investigate the impact of QQI within the MMO-FL framework and present a
comprehensive theoretical analysis quantifying how both types of imbalance
degrade learning performance. To address these challenges, we propose the
Modality Quantity and Quality Rebalanced (QQR) algorithm, a prototype learning
based method designed to operate in parallel with the training process.
Extensive experiments on two real-world multimodal datasets show that the
proposed QQR algorithm consistently outperforms benchmarks under modality
imbalance conditions with promising learning performance.

Conclusion: 该模型为多视图学习提供了一种高效解决方案，尤其适用于数据缺失和标签不足的场景。

Abstract: Multi-view learning is widely applied to real-life datasets, such as multiple
omics biological data, but it often suffers from both missing views and missing
labels. Prior probabilistic approaches addressed the missing view problem by
using a product-of-experts scheme to aggregate representations from present
views and achieved superior performance over deterministic classifiers, using
the information bottleneck (IB) principle. However, the IB framework is
inherently fully supervised and cannot leverage unlabeled data. In this work,
we propose a semi-supervised generative model that utilizes both labeled and
unlabeled samples in a unified framework. Our method maximizes the likelihood
of unlabeled samples to learn a latent space shared with the IB on labeled
data. We also perform cross-view mutual information maximization in the latent
space to enhance the extraction of shared information across views. Compared to
existing approaches, our model achieves better predictive and imputation
performance on both image and multi-omics data with missing views and limited
labeled samples.

Abstract: A fundamental limitation of probabilistic deep learning is its predominant
reliance on Gaussian priors. This simplistic assumption prevents models from
accurately capturing the complex, non-Gaussian landscapes of natural data,
particularly in demanding domains like complex biological data, severely
hindering the fidelity of the model for scientific discovery. The
physically-grounded Boltzmann distribution offers a more expressive
alternative, but it is computationally intractable on classical computers. To
date, quantum approaches have been hampered by the insufficient qubit scale and
operational stability required for the iterative demands of deep learning.
Here, we bridge this gap by introducing the Quantum Boltzmann
Machine-Variational Autoencoder (QBM-VAE), a large-scale and long-time stable
hybrid quantum-classical architecture. Our framework leverages a quantum
processor for efficient sampling from the Boltzmann distribution, enabling its
use as a powerful prior within a deep generative model. Applied to
million-scale single-cell datasets from multiple sources, the QBM-VAE generates
a latent space that better preserves complex biological structures,
consistently outperforming conventional Gaussian-based deep learning models
like VAE and SCVI in essential tasks such as omics data integration, cell-type
classification, and trajectory inference. It also provides a typical example of
introducing a physics priori into deep learning to drive the model to acquire
scientific discovery capabilities that breaks through data limitations. This
work provides the demonstration of a practical quantum advantage in deep
learning on a large-scale scientific problem and offers a transferable
blueprint for developing hybrid quantum AI models.

Abstract: Structure-preserving approaches to dynamics modeling have demonstrated great
potential for modeling physical systems due to their strong inductive biases
that enforce conservation laws and dissipative behavior. However, the resulting
models are typically trained for fixed system configurations, requiring
explicit knowledge of system parameters as well as costly retraining for each
new set of parameters -- a major limitation in many-query or parameter-varying
scenarios. Meta-learning offers a potential solution, but existing approaches
like optimization-based meta-learning often suffer from training instability or
limited generalization capability. Inspired by ideas from computer vision, we
introduce a modulation-based meta-learning framework that directly conditions
structure-preserving models on compact latent representations of potentially
unknown system parameters, avoiding the need for gray-box system knowledge and
explicit optimization during adaptation. Through the application of novel
modulation strategies to parametric energy-conserving and dissipative systems,
we enable scalable and generalizable learning across parametric families of
dynamical systems. Experiments on standard benchmark problems demonstrate that
our approach achieves accurate predictions in few-shot learning settings,
without compromising on the essential physical constraints necessary for
dynamical stability and effective generalization performance across parameter
space.

Abstract: Risk assessments for a pediatric population are often conducted across
multiple stages. For example, clinicians may evaluate risks prenatally, at
birth, and during Well-Child visits. Although predictions made at later stages
typically achieve higher precision, it is clinically desirable to make reliable
risk assessments as early as possible. Therefore, this study focuses on
improving prediction performance in early-stage risk assessments. Our solution,
\textbf{Borrowing From the Future (BFF)}, is a contrastive multi-modal
framework that treats each time window as a distinct modality. In BFF, a model
is trained on all available data throughout the time while performing a risk
assessment using up-to-date information. This contrastive framework allows the
model to ``borrow'' informative signals from later stages (e.g., Well-Child
visits) to implicitly supervise the learning at earlier stages (e.g.,
prenatal/birth stages). We validate BFF on two real-world pediatric outcome
prediction tasks, demonstrating consistent improvements in early risk
assessments. The code is available at https://github.com/scotsun/bff.

Conclusion: 认为这些问题与泛化和预测密切相关，是未来研究的重点。

Abstract: Explanations of cognitive behavior often appeal to computations over
representations. What does it take for a system to implement a given
computation over suitable representational vehicles within that system? We
argue that the language of causality -- and specifically the theory of causal
abstraction -- provides a fruitful lens on this topic. Drawing on current
discussions in deep learning with artificial neural networks, we illustrate how
classical themes in the philosophy of computation and cognition resurface in
contemporary machine learning. We offer an account of computational
implementation grounded in causal abstraction, and examine the role for
representation in the resulting picture. We argue that these issues are most
profitably explored in connection with generalization and prediction.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于CNN-LSTM混合架构的PM2.5浓度预测模型，结合空间和时间特征，实验结果显示其优于传统时间序列模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 全球气候变化加剧，准确预测PM2.5浓度对环境保护、公共健康和城市管理至关重要。

Method: 采用CNN提取局部空间特征，LSTM建模时间序列依赖，使用北京工业区2010-2015年的多变量数据集进行预测。

Result: 模型在6小时平均PM2.5浓度预测中RMSE为5.236，优于传统模型。

Conclusion: 模型在现实应用中有潜力，但计算资源需求高，未来需优化多变量处理能力和扩展性。

Abstract: With the intensification of global climate change, accurate prediction of air
quality indicators, especially PM2.5 concentration, has become increasingly
important in fields such as environmental protection, public health, and urban
management. To address this, we propose an air quality PM2.5 index prediction
model based on a hybrid CNN-LSTM architecture. The model effectively combines
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for local spatial feature extraction and
Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for modeling temporal dependencies in
time series data. Using a multivariate dataset collected from an industrial
area in Beijing between 2010 and 2015 -- which includes hourly records of PM2.5
concentration, temperature, dew point, pressure, wind direction, wind speed,
and precipitation -- the model predicts the average PM2.5 concentration over
6-hour intervals. Experimental results show that the model achieves a root mean
square error (RMSE) of 5.236, outperforming traditional time series models in
both accuracy and generalization. This demonstrates its strong potential in
real-world applications such as air pollution early warning systems. However,
due to the complexity of multivariate inputs, the model demands high
computational resources, and its ability to handle diverse atmospheric factors
still requires optimization. Future work will focus on enhancing scalability
and expanding support for more complex multivariate weather prediction tasks.

Abstract: This paper presents an enhanced version of the Interactive Voting-Based Map
Matching algorithm, designed to efficiently process trajectories with varying

accuracy, independent of input data quality. Building upon the original
algorithm, developed exclusively for aligning GPS signals to road networks, we
extend its capabilities by integrating trajectory imputation. Our improvements
also include the implementation of a distance-bounded interactive voting
strategy to reduce computational complexity, as well as modifications to
address missing data in the road network. Furthermore, we incorporate a
custom-built asset derived from OpenStreetMap, enabling this approach to be
smoothly applied in any geographic region covered by OpenStreetMap's road
network. These advancements preserve the core strengths of the original
algorithm while significantly extending its applicability to diverse real-world
scenarios.

Conclusion: GODNF在适应性、深度和理论理解上优于现有方法。

Abstract: There has been a growing interest in developing diffusion-based Graph Neural
Networks (GNNs), building on the connections between message passing mechanisms
in GNNs and physical diffusion processes. However, existing methods suffer from
three critical limitations: (1) they rely on homogeneous diffusion with static
dynamics, limiting adaptability to diverse graph structures; (2) their depth is
constrained by computational overhead and diminishing interpretability; and (3)
theoretical understanding of their convergence behavior remains limited. To
address these challenges, we propose GODNF, a Generalized Opinion Dynamics
Neural Framework, which unifies multiple opinion dynamics models into a
principled, trainable diffusion mechanism. Our framework captures heterogeneous
diffusion patterns and temporal dynamics via node-specific behavior modeling
and dynamic neighborhood influence, while ensuring efficient and interpretable
message propagation even at deep layers. We provide a rigorous theoretical
analysis demonstrating GODNF's ability to model diverse convergence
configurations. Extensive empirical evaluations of node classification and
influence estimation tasks confirm GODNF's superiority over state-of-the-art
GNNs.

Motivation: 随着LLMs能力的提升，其在高风险领域的应用需要确保群体公平性，但传统方法不适用于封闭权重LLMs。

Result: 在五个数据集上验证了框架的准确性与公平性权衡，优于传统方法。

Conclusion: 该框架高效且适用于封闭权重LLMs，为公平分类提供了新思路。

Abstract: Instruction fine-tuned large language models (LLMs) enable a simple zero-shot
or few-shot prompting paradigm, also known as in-context learning, for building
prediction models. This convenience, combined with continued advances in LLM
capability, has the potential to drive their adoption across a broad range of
domains, including high-stakes applications where group fairness -- preventing
disparate impacts across demographic groups -- is essential. The majority of
existing approaches to enforcing group fairness on LLM-based classifiers rely
on traditional fair algorithms applied via model fine-tuning or head-tuning on
final-layer embeddings, but they are no longer applicable to closed-weight LLMs
under the in-context learning setting, which include some of the most capable
commercial models today, such as GPT-4, Gemini, and Claude. In this paper, we
propose a framework for deriving fair classifiers from closed-weight LLMs via
prompting: the LLM is treated as a feature extractor, and features are elicited
from its probabilistic predictions (e.g., token log probabilities) using
prompts strategically designed for the specified fairness criterion to obtain
sufficient statistics for fair classification; a fair algorithm is then applied
to these features to train a lightweight fair classifier in a post-hoc manner.
Experiments on five datasets, including three tabular ones, demonstrate strong
accuracy-fairness tradeoffs for the classifiers derived by our framework from
both open-weight and closed-weight LLMs; in particular, our framework is
data-efficient and outperforms fair classifiers trained on LLM embeddings
(i.e., head-tuning) or from scratch on raw tabular features.

Conclusion: 研究强调了时间结构在对抗学习中的重要性，为构建鲁棒的SNN模型提供了理论基础。

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) offer a promising direction for
energy-efficient and brain-inspired computing, yet their vulnerability to
adversarial perturbations remains poorly understood. In this work, we revisit
the adversarial robustness of SNNs through the lens of temporal ensembling,
treating the network as a collection of evolving sub-networks across discrete
timesteps. This formulation uncovers two critical but underexplored
challenges-the fragility of individual temporal sub-networks and the tendency
for adversarial vulnerabilities to transfer across time. To overcome these
limitations, we propose Robust Temporal self-Ensemble (RTE), a training
framework that improves the robustness of each sub-network while reducing the
temporal transferability of adversarial perturbations. RTE integrates both
objectives into a unified loss and employs a stochastic sampling strategy for
efficient optimization. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks
demonstrate that RTE consistently outperforms existing training methods in
robust-accuracy trade-off. Additional analyses reveal that RTE reshapes the
internal robustness landscape of SNNs, leading to more resilient and temporally
diversified decision boundaries. Our study highlights the importance of
temporal structure in adversarial learning and offers a principled foundation
for building robust spiking models.

Motivation: 现有方法依赖同质性低频知识，无法处理真实图中多样谱分布，需解决谱对齐问题以实现高效知识迁移。

Method: 采用混合谱滤波主干和局部-全局对比学习获取丰富谱知识，设计提示图对齐谱分布。

Result: 实验验证了HS-GPPT在转导和归纳学习中的有效性。

Conclusion: HS-GPPT通过谱对齐显著提升了知识迁移效果，适用于不同同质性场景。

Abstract: Graph ``pre-training and prompt-tuning'' aligns downstream tasks with
pre-trained objectives to enable efficient knowledge transfer under limited
supervision. However, existing methods rely on homophily-based low-frequency
knowledge, failing to handle diverse spectral distributions in real-world
graphs with varying homophily. Our theoretical analysis reveals a spectral
specificity principle: optimal knowledge transfer requires alignment between
pre-trained spectral filters and the intrinsic spectrum of downstream graphs.
Under limited supervision, large spectral gaps between pre-training and
downstream tasks impede effective adaptation. To bridge this gap, we propose
the HS-GPPT model, a novel framework that ensures spectral alignment throughout
both pre-training and prompt-tuning. We utilize a hybrid spectral filter
backbone and local-global contrastive learning to acquire abundant spectral
knowledge. Then we design prompt graphs to align the spectral distribution with
pretexts, facilitating spectral knowledge transfer across homophily and
heterophily. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness under both
transductive and inductive learning settings. Our code is available at

Abstract: We introduce RegimeNAS, a novel differentiable architecture search framework
specifically designed to enhance cryptocurrency trading performance by
explicitly integrating market regime awareness. Addressing the limitations of
static deep learning models in highly dynamic financial environments, RegimeNAS
features three core innovations: (1) a theoretically grounded Bayesian search
space optimizing architectures with provable convergence properties; (2)
specialized, dynamically activated neural modules (Volatility, Trend, and Range
blocks) tailored for distinct market conditions; and (3) a multi-objective loss
function incorporating market-specific penalties (e.g., volatility matching,
transition smoothness) alongside mathematically enforced Lipschitz stability
constraints. Regime identification leverages multi-head attention across
multiple timeframes for improved accuracy and uncertainty estimation. Rigorous
empirical evaluation on extensive real-world cryptocurrency data demonstrates
that RegimeNAS significantly outperforms state-of-the-art benchmarks, achieving
an 80.3% Mean Absolute Error reduction compared to the best traditional
recurrent baseline and converging substantially faster (9 vs. 50+ epochs).
Ablation studies and regime-specific analysis confirm the critical contribution
of each component, particularly the regime-aware adaptation mechanism. This
work underscores the imperative of embedding domain-specific knowledge, such as
market regimes, directly within the NAS process to develop robust and adaptive
models for challenging financial applications.

Motivation: 现有CP方法在长尾标签分布下，尾部类别的覆盖率不足，影响预测集的可靠性。

Method: 提出TACP方法，利用长尾结构缩小头尾覆盖率差距；进一步提出sTACP，通过重加权机制优化覆盖率平衡。

Result: 理论分析表明TACP能缩小头尾覆盖率差距；实验验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: TACP和sTACP能有效改善长尾分布下的覆盖率不平衡问题。

Abstract: Conformal Prediction (CP) is a popular method for uncertainty quantification
that converts a pretrained model's point prediction into a prediction set, with
the set size reflecting the model's confidence. Although existing CP methods
are guaranteed to achieve marginal coverage, they often exhibit imbalanced
coverage across classes under long-tail label distributions, tending to over
cover the head classes at the expense of under covering the remaining tail
classes. This under coverage is particularly concerning, as it undermines the
reliability of the prediction sets for minority classes, even with coverage
ensured on average. In this paper, we propose the Tail-Aware Conformal
Prediction (TACP) method to mitigate the under coverage of the tail classes by
utilizing the long-tail structure and narrowing the head-tail coverage gap.
Theoretical analysis shows that it consistently achieves a smaller head-tail
coverage gap than standard methods. To further improve coverage balance across
all classes, we introduce an extension of TACP: soft TACP (sTACP) via a
reweighting mechanism. The proposed framework can be combined with various
non-conformity scores, and experiments on multiple long-tail benchmark datasets
demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods.

Motivation: 随着DNN模型的广泛使用，训练成本高昂成为挑战。现有模块化方法在小规模CNN上表现良好，但难以适应多样化和大规模模型。

Method: NeMo在神经元级别操作，采用对比学习和复合损失函数，适用于各种架构，特别是Transformer。

Result: 实验显示，NeMo在模块分类准确率上平均提升1.72%，模块大小减少58.10%，在CNN和Transformer上均表现优异。

Conclusion: NeMo为DNN模块化提供了一种可扩展且通用的解决方案，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: With the growing incorporation of deep neural network (DNN) models into
modern software systems, the prohibitive construction costs have become a
significant challenge. Model reuse has been widely applied to reduce training
costs, but indiscriminately reusing entire models may incur significant
inference overhead. Consequently, DNN modularization has gained attention,
enabling module reuse by decomposing DNN models. The emerging
modularizing-while-training (MwT) paradigm, which incorporates modularization
into training, outperforms modularizing-after-training approaches. However,
existing MwT methods focus on small-scale CNN models at the convolutional
kernel level and struggle with diverse DNNs and large-scale models,
particularly Transformer-based models. To address these limitations, we propose
NeMo, a scalable and generalizable MwT approach. NeMo operates at the neuron
level fundamental component common to all DNNs-ensuring applicability to
Transformers and various architectures. We design a contrastive learning-based
modular training method with an effective composite loss function, enabling
scalability to large-scale models. Comprehensive experiments on two
Transformer-based models and four CNN models across two classification datasets
demonstrate NeMo's superiority over state-of-the-art MwT methods. Results show
average gains of 1.72% in module classification accuracy and 58.10% reduction
in module size, demonstrating efficacy across both CNN and large-scale
Transformer-based models. A case study on open-source projects shows NeMo's
potential benefits in practical scenarios, offering a promising approach for
scalable and generalizable DNN modularization.

Motivation: 由于造林和再造林项目的碳汇效果常依赖自我报告或有限的外部验证，数据可靠性和项目完整性受到质疑，因此需要更透明和标准化的验证方法。

Method: 研究整合了全球45,628个项目的1,289,068个种植地点的数据，结合时间序列卫星图像和其他辅助数据，提出了LDIS指标来评估地理位置数据的完整性。

Result: 约79%的地理参考种植地点在10项LDIS指标中至少有一项不合格，15%的项目缺乏机器可读的地理参考数据。

Conclusion: 该数据集不仅提高了自愿碳市场的透明度，还可作为计算机视觉任务的训练数据，具有广泛的应用价值。

Abstract: Afforestation and reforestation are popular strategies for mitigating climate
change by enhancing carbon sequestration. However, the effectiveness of these
efforts is often self-reported by project developers, or certified through
processes with limited external validation. This leads to concerns about data
reliability and project integrity. In response to increasing scrutiny of
voluntary carbon markets, this study presents a dataset on global afforestation
and reforestation efforts compiled from primary (meta-)information and
augmented with time-series satellite imagery and other secondary data. Our
dataset covers 1,289,068 planting sites from 45,628 projects spanning 33 years.
Since any remote sensing-based validation effort relies on the integrity of a
planting site's geographic boundary, this dataset introduces a standardized
assessment of the provided site-level location information, which we summarize
in one easy-to-communicate key indicator: LDIS -- the Location Data Integrity
Score. We find that approximately 79\% of the georeferenced planting sites
monitored fail on at least 1 out of 10 LDIS indicators, while 15\% of the
monitored projects lack machine-readable georeferenced data in the first place.
In addition to enhancing accountability in the voluntary carbon market, the
presented dataset also holds value as training data for e.g. computer
vision-related tasks with millions of linked Sentinel-2 and Planetscope
satellite images.

Result: 理论分析和实验表明HGD具有次线性遗憾界，并在不平衡数据流学习中表现优异。

Conclusion: HGD是一种高效且通用的不平衡数据流学习方法，适用于任何基于梯度下降的模型。

Abstract: Many real-world data are sequentially collected over time and often exhibit
skewed class distributions, resulting in imbalanced data streams. While
existing approaches have explored several strategies, such as resampling and
reweighting, for imbalanced data stream learning, our work distinguishes itself
by addressing the imbalance problem through training modification, particularly
focusing on gradient descent techniques. We introduce the harmonized gradient
descent (HGD) algorithm, which aims to equalize the norms of gradients across
different classes. By ensuring the gradient norm balance, HGD mitigates
under-fitting for minor classes and achieves balanced online learning. Notably,
HGD operates in a streamlined implementation process, requiring no data-buffer,
extra parameters, or prior knowledge, making it applicable to any learning
models utilizing gradient descent for optimization. Theoretical analysis, based
on a few common and mild assumptions, shows that HGD achieves a satisfied
sub-linear regret bound. The proposed algorithm are compared with the commonly
used online imbalance learning methods under several imbalanced data stream
scenarios. Extensive experimental evaluations demonstrate the efficiency and
effectiveness of HGD in learning imbalanced data streams.

Motivation: 大型语言模型在复杂推理任务中表现优异，但仍依赖标注数据且无监督适应性有限。测试时强化学习（TTRL）虽能自优化，但面临高推理成本和早期估计偏差等问题。

Method: 引入两种策略：熵分叉树多数滚动（ETMR）和基于熵的优势重塑（EAR），以优化探索-利用平衡。

Result: 在AIME 2024基准测试中，Llama3.1-8B模型的Pass at 1指标相对提升68%，且仅消耗60%的滚动令牌预算。

Conclusion: 该方法有效平衡了推理效率、多样性和估计鲁棒性，推动了无监督强化学习在开放域推理任务中的应用。

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models have yielded significant
improvements in complex reasoning tasks such as mathematics and programming.
However, these models remain heavily dependent on annotated data and exhibit
limited adaptability in unsupervised scenarios. To address these limitations,
test-time reinforcement learning (TTRL) has been proposed, which enables
self-optimization by leveraging model-generated pseudo-labels. Despite its
promise, TTRL faces several key challenges, including high inference costs due
to parallel rollouts and early-stage estimation bias that fosters
overconfidence, reducing output diversity and causing performance plateaus. To
address these challenges, we introduce an entropy-based mechanism to enhance
the exploration-exploitation balance in test-time reinforcement learning
through two strategies: Entropy-fork Tree Majority Rollout (ETMR) and
Entropy-based Advantage Reshaping (EAR). Compared with the baseline, our
approach enables Llama3.1-8B to achieve a 68 percent relative improvement in
Pass at 1 metric on the AIME 2024 benchmark, while consuming only 60 percent of
the rollout tokens budget. This highlights our method's ability to effectively
optimize the trade-off between inference efficiency, diversity, and estimation
robustness, thereby advancing unsupervised reinforcement learning for
open-domain reasoning tasks.

Conclusion: PTSM通过解耦神经表征，实现了个性化和可迁移的解码。

Abstract: Cross-subject electroencephalography (EEG) decoding remains a fundamental
challenge in brain-computer interface (BCI) research due to substantial
inter-subject variability and the scarcity of subject-invariant
representations. This paper proposed PTSM (Physiology-aware and Task-invariant
Spatio-temporal Modeling), a novel framework for interpretable and robust EEG
decoding across unseen subjects. PTSM employs a dual-branch masking mechanism
that independently learns personalized and shared spatio-temporal patterns,
enabling the model to preserve individual-specific neural characteristics while
extracting task-relevant, population-shared features. The masks are factorized
across temporal and spatial dimensions, allowing fine-grained modulation of
dynamic EEG patterns with low computational overhead. To further address
representational entanglement, PTSM enforces information-theoretic constraints
that decompose latent embeddings into orthogonal task-related and
subject-related subspaces. The model is trained end-to-end via a
multi-objective loss integrating classification, contrastive, and
disentanglement objectives. Extensive experiments on cross-subject motor
imagery datasets demonstrate that PTSM achieves strong zero-shot
generalization, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines without
subject-specific calibration. Results highlight the efficacy of disentangled
neural representations for achieving both personalized and transferable
decoding in non-stationary neurophysiological settings.

Motivation: 传统强化学习算法通常依赖个体奖励信号，但成对偏好信息可能更易获取且更具信息量。DFA旨在融合这两种信号，提升学习效率和稳定性。

Method: DFA通过策略的对数概率直接建模偏好概率，无需单独奖励建模。偏好数据可来自人工标注或从离线回放缓冲区合成。基于Bradley-Terry模型，DFA的偏好损失最小化可恢复SAC策略。

Conclusion: DFA通过融合奖励和偏好信号，提供了一种高效且稳定的强化学习方法，尤其在偏好数据可用时表现优异。

Abstract: We present Dual-Feedback Actor (DFA), a reinforcement learning algorithm that
fuses both individual rewards and pairwise preferences (if available) into a
single update rule. DFA uses the policy's log-probabilities directly to model
the preference probability, avoiding a separate reward-modeling step.
Preferences can be provided by human-annotators (at state-level or
trajectory-level) or be synthesized online from Q-values stored in an
off-policy replay buffer. Under a Bradley-Terry model, we prove that minimizing
DFA's preference loss recovers the entropy-regularized Soft Actor-Critic (SAC)
policy. Our simulation results show that DFA trained on generated preferences
matches or exceeds SAC on six control environments and demonstrates a more
stable training process. With only a semi-synthetic preference dataset under
Bradley-Terry model, our algorithm outperforms reward-modeling reinforcement
learning from human feedback (RLHF) baselines in a stochastic GridWorld and
approaches the performance of an oracle with true rewards.

TL;DR: 论文提出在决策聚焦学习（DFL）中，通过最小化替代损失而非直接优化决策遗憾，提升梯度计算效率，并验证了DYS-Net方法的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有梯度DFL方法在LP问题中梯度几乎为零，导致优化效果不佳。

Method: 提出最小化替代损失，结合DYS-Net高效计算近似解和梯度。

Result: 实验显示该方法在决策遗憾和训练时间上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 最小化替代损失结合DYS-Net可显著提升DFL效果和效率。

Abstract: Decision-focused learning (DFL) trains a machine learning (ML) model to
predict parameters of an optimization problem, to directly minimize decision
regret, i.e., maximize decision quality. Gradient-based DFL requires computing
the derivative of the solution to the optimization problem with respect to the
predicted parameters. However, for many optimization problems, such as linear
programs (LPs), the gradient of the regret with respect to the predicted
parameters is zero almost everywhere. Existing gradient-based DFL approaches
for LPs try to circumvent this issue in one of two ways: (a) smoothing the LP
into a differentiable optimization problem by adding a quadratic regularizer
and then minimizing the regret directly or (b) minimizing surrogate losses that
have informative (sub)gradients. In this paper, we show that the former
approach still results in zero gradients, because even after smoothing the
regret remains constant across large regions of the parameter space. To address
this, we propose minimizing surrogate losses -- even when a differentiable
optimization layer is used and regret can be minimized directly. Our
experiments demonstrate that minimizing surrogate losses allows differentiable
optimization layers to achieve regret comparable to or better than
surrogate-loss based DFL methods. Further, we demonstrate that this also holds
for DYS-Net, a recently proposed differentiable optimization technique for LPs,
that computes approximate solutions and gradients through operations that can
be performed using feedforward neural network layers. Because DYS-Net executes
the forward and the backward pass very efficiently, by minimizing surrogate
losses using DYS-Net, we are able to attain regret on par with the
state-of-the-art while reducing training time by a significant margin.

*Michael Banf,Dominik Filipiak,Max Schattauer,Liliya Imasheva*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于Forman-Ricci曲率的结构提升策略，用于解决图神经网络中信息传递的失真问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界中的复杂系统（如社交或生物网络）需要更高阶的拓扑结构来表示，而传统图神经网络难以处理此类结构。

Method: 利用Forman-Ricci曲率将数据从基本图形式提升到更复杂的拓扑结构，以揭示图的局部和全局特性。

Result: 该方法能够缓解图学习中信息传递的失真问题（如过度挤压现象）。

Conclusion: 通过几何和拓扑深度学习的结合，为复杂系统的建模提供了更有效的方法。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks are highly effective at learning from relational data,
leveraging node and edge features while maintaining the symmetries inherent to
graph structures. However, many real-world systems, such as social or
biological networks, exhibit complex interactions that are more naturally
represented by higher-order topological domains. The emerging field of
Geometric and Topological Deep Learning addresses this challenge by introducing
methods that utilize and benefit from higher-order structures. Central to TDL
is the concept of lifting, which transforms data representations from basic
graph forms to more expressive topologies before the application of GNN models
for learning. In this work, we propose a structural lifting strategy using
Forman-Ricci curvature, which defines an edge-based network characteristic
based on Riemannian geometry. Curvature reveals local and global properties of
a graph, such as a network's backbones, i.e. coarse, structure-preserving graph
geometries that form connections between major communities - most suitably
represented as hyperedges to model information flows between clusters across
large distances in the network. To this end, our approach provides a remedy to
the problem of information distortion in message passing across long distances
and graph bottlenecks - a phenomenon known in graph learning as over-squashing.

TL;DR: CHORD框架通过动态权重统一SFT和RL，避免破坏模型模式，显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有SFT和RL结合方法可能破坏模型模式和对专家数据过拟合的问题。

Method: 提出CHORD框架，将SFT作为动态加权辅助目标融入RL，采用全局系数和令牌级权重函数。

Result: 实验证明CHORD实现稳定高效学习，显著优于基线方法。

Conclusion: CHORD有效协调专家数据和探索，为未来研究提供新思路。

Abstract: Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Reinforcement Learning (RL) are two
prominent post-training paradigms for refining the capabilities and aligning
the behavior of Large Language Models (LLMs). Existing approaches that
integrate SFT and RL often face the risk of disrupting established model
patterns and inducing overfitting to expert data. To address this, we present a
novel investigation into the unified view of SFT and RL through an off-policy
versus on-policy lens. We propose CHORD, a framework for the Controllable
Harmonization of On- and Off-Policy Reinforcement Learning via Dynamic
Weighting, which reframes SFT not as a separate stage but as a dynamically
weighted auxiliary objective within the on-policy RL process. Based on an
analysis of off-policy expert data's influence at both holistic and granular
levels, we incorporate a dual-control mechanism in CHORD. Specifically, the
framework first employs a global coefficient to holistically guide the
transition from off-policy imitation to on-policy exploration, and then applies
a token-wise weighting function that enables granular learning from expert
tokens, which preserves on-policy exploration and mitigates disruption from
off-policy data. We conduct extensive experiments on widely used benchmarks,
providing empirical evidence that CHORD achieves a stable and efficient
learning process. By effectively harmonizing off-policy expert data with
on-policy exploration, CHORD demonstrates significant improvements over
baselines. We release the implementation at
https://github.com/modelscope/Trinity-RFT/tree/main/examples/mix_chord to
inspire further research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在优化抗体互补决定区（CDRs）时效率低下且成本高昂，因此需要一种更高效的优化方法。

Method: 提出LEAD框架，在共享潜在空间中优化序列和结构，并设计黑盒指导策略以适应非可微分属性评估器。

Result: 实验表明，LEAD在单目标和多目标优化中表现优异，查询消耗减少一半，且性能优于基线方法。

Conclusion: LEAD通过潜在空间优化和黑盒策略，显著提升了抗体设计的效率和性能。

Abstract: Advancements in deep generative models have enabled the joint modeling of
antibody sequence and structure, given the antigen-antibody complex as context.
However, existing approaches for optimizing complementarity-determining regions
(CDRs) to improve developability properties operate in the raw data space,
leading to excessively costly evaluations due to the inefficient search
process. To address this, we propose LatEnt blAck-box Design (LEAD), a
sequence-structure co-design framework that optimizes both sequence and
structure within their shared latent space. Optimizing shared latent codes can
not only break through the limitations of existing methods, but also ensure
synchronization of different modality designs. Particularly, we design a
black-box guidance strategy to accommodate real-world scenarios where many
property evaluators are non-differentiable. Experimental results demonstrate
that our LEAD achieves superior optimization performance for both single and
multi-property objectives. Notably, LEAD reduces query consumption by a half
while surpassing baseline methods in property optimization. The code is

Motivation: 神经网络的输入噪声和对抗攻击可能导致其脆弱性，因此需要提升模型的鲁棒性。

Method: 利用收缩理论设计正则化项或权重正则化，使NODEs具有收缩性，从而增强对输入扰动的鲁棒性。

Result: 在MNIST和FashionMNIST数据集上，该方法有效提升了模型对噪声和攻击的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 通过收缩理论和正则化方法，可以显著提升NODEs的鲁棒性，适用于对抗性环境。

Abstract: Neural networks can be fragile to input noise and adversarial attacks.
  In this work, we consider Convolutional Neural Ordinary Differential
Equations (NODEs), a family of continuous-depth neural networks represented by
dynamical systems, and propose to use contraction theory to improve their
robustness.
  For a contractive dynamical system two trajectories starting from different
initial conditions converge to each other exponentially fast.
  Contractive Convolutional NODEs can enjoy increased robustness as slight
perturbations of the features do not cause a significant change in the output.
  Contractivity can be induced during training by using a regularization term
involving the Jacobian of the system dynamics.
  To reduce the computational burden, we show that it can also be promoted
using carefully selected weight regularization terms for a class of NODEs with
slope-restricted activation functions.
  The performance of the proposed regularizers is illustrated through benchmark
image classification tasks on MNIST and FashionMNIST datasets, where images are
corrupted by different kinds of noise and attacks.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为mCOCO的新框架，通过Reservoir Computing（RC）从BOLD信号中学习群体水平的功能性连接脑模板（CBT），解决了现有方法的局限性，如解释性差、计算成本高和忽略认知能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有CBT学习方法（如传统机器学习和图神经网络）存在解释性差、计算成本高和忽略认知能力的局限性，因此需要一种更高效且能捕捉认知特性的新方法。

Method: mCOCO框架分为两阶段：1）将BOLD信号映射到储备池中，生成个体功能连接组并聚合为群体CBT；2）通过认知储备池整合多感官输入，赋予CBT认知特性。

Result: 实验表明，mCOCO生成的模板在中心性、区分性、拓扑合理性和多感官记忆保留方面显著优于基于GNN的CBT。

Conclusion: mCOCO框架通过RC和多感官输入，提供了一种高效且具有认知特性的CBT学习方法，优于现有方法。

Abstract: The generation of connectional brain templates (CBTs) has recently garnered
significant attention for its potential to identify unique connectivity
patterns shared across individuals. However, existing methods for CBT learning
such as conventional machine learning and graph neural networks (GNNs) are
hindered by several limitations. These include: (i) poor interpretability due
to their black-box nature, (ii) high computational cost, and (iii) an exclusive
focus on structure and topology, overlooking the cognitive capacity of the
generated CBT. To address these challenges, we introduce mCOCO (multi-sensory
COgnitive COmputing), a novel framework that leverages Reservoir Computing (RC)
to learn population-level functional CBT from BOLD
(Blood-Oxygen-level-Dependent) signals. RC's dynamic system properties allow
for tracking state changes over time, enhancing interpretability and enabling
the modeling of brain-like dynamics, as demonstrated in prior literature. By
integrating multi-sensory inputs (e.g., text, audio, and visual data), mCOCO
captures not only structure and topology but also how brain regions process
information and adapt to cognitive tasks such as sensory processing, all in a
computationally efficient manner. Our mCOCO framework consists of two phases:
(1) mapping BOLD signals into the reservoir to derive individual functional
connectomes, which are then aggregated into a group-level CBT - an approach, to
the best of our knowledge, not previously explored in functional connectivity
studies - and (2) incorporating multi-sensory inputs through a cognitive
reservoir, endowing the CBT with cognitive traits. Extensive evaluations show
that our mCOCO-based template significantly outperforms GNN-based CBT in terms
of centeredness, discriminativeness, topological soundness, and multi-sensory
memory retention. Our source code is available at
https://github.com/basiralab/mCOCO.

Result: 证明许多流行解释算法对复杂决策函数不具信息性，并推导出算法具信息性的条件。

Conclusion: 研究对解释算法的实际应用（如审计、监管和高风险AI应用）有重要影响，并提出了改进方向。

Abstract: Many researchers have suggested that local post-hoc explanation algorithms
can be used to gain insights into the behavior of complex machine learning
models. However, theoretical guarantees about such algorithms only exist for
simple decision functions, and it is unclear whether and under which
assumptions similar results might exist for complex models. In this paper, we
introduce a general, learning-theory-based framework for what it means for an
explanation to provide information about a decision function. We call an
explanation informative if it serves to reduce the complexity of the space of
plausible decision functions. With this approach, we show that many popular
explanation algorithms are not informative when applied to complex decision
functions, providing a rigorous mathematical rejection of the idea that it
should be possible to explain any model. We then derive conditions under which
different explanation algorithms become informative. These are often stronger
than what one might expect. For example, gradient explanations and
counterfactual explanations are non-informative with respect to the space of
differentiable functions, and SHAP and anchor explanations are not informative
with respect to the space of decision trees. Based on these results, we discuss
how explanation algorithms can be modified to become informative. While the
proposed analysis of explanation algorithms is mathematical, we argue that it
holds strong implications for the practical applicability of these algorithms,
particularly for auditing, regulation, and high-risk applications of AI.

Motivation: 随着深度学习等复杂数据模型的应用，不确定性量化变得困难，需要验证不同算法在不确定性估计中的表现。

Method: 采用近似贝叶斯推断框架，在合成分类数据集上测试六种算法（包括神经网络集成、证据深度学习等），评估其校准性和分布外数据不确定性。

Result: 所有算法均表现良好校准性，但深度学习算法在分布外数据上的不确定性估计不一致。

Conclusion: 研究为开发科学数据驱动建模中的不确定性估计方法提供了参考。

Abstract: Rigorous statistical methods, including parameter estimation with
accompanying uncertainties, underpin the validity of scientific discovery,
especially in the natural sciences. With increasingly complex data models such
as deep learning techniques, uncertainty quantification has become exceedingly
difficult and a plethora of techniques have been proposed. In this case study,
we use the unifying framework of approximate Bayesian inference combined with
empirical tests on carefully created synthetic classification datasets to
investigate qualitative properties of six different probabilistic machine
learning algorithms for class probability and uncertainty estimation: (i) a
neural network ensemble, (ii) neural network ensemble with conflictual loss,
(iii) evidential deep learning, (iv) a single neural network with Monte Carlo
Dropout, (v) Gaussian process classification and (vi) a Dirichlet process
mixture model. We check if the algorithms produce uncertainty estimates which
reflect commonly desired properties, such as being well calibrated and
exhibiting an increase in uncertainty for out-of-distribution data points. Our
results indicate that all algorithms are well calibrated, but none of the deep
learning based algorithms provide uncertainties that consistently reflect lack
of experimental evidence for out-of-distribution data points. We hope our study
may serve as a clarifying example for researchers developing new methods of
uncertainty estimation for scientific data-driven modeling.

Abstract: Motor vehicle crashes remain a leading cause of injury and death worldwide,
necessitating data-driven approaches to understand and mitigate crash severity.
This study introduces a curated dataset of more than 3 million people involved
in accidents in Ohio over six years (2017-2022), aggregated to more than 2.3
million vehicle-level records for predictive analysis. The primary contribution
is a transparent and reproducible methodology that combines Automated Machine
Learning (AutoML) and explainable artificial intelligence (AI) to identify and
interpret key risk factors associated with severe crashes. Using the JADBio
AutoML platform, predictive models were constructed to distinguish between
severe and non-severe crash outcomes. The models underwent rigorous feature
selection across stratified training subsets, and their outputs were
interpreted using SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) to quantify the
contribution of individual features. A final Ridge Logistic Regression model
achieved an AUC-ROC of 85.6% on the training set and 84.9% on a hold-out test
set, with 17 features consistently identified as the most influential
predictors. Key features spanned demographic, environmental, vehicle, human,
and operational categories, including location type, posted speed, minimum
occupant age, and pre-crash action. Notably, certain traditionally emphasized
factors, such as alcohol or drug impairment, were less influential in the final
model compared to environmental and contextual variables. Emphasizing
methodological rigor and interpretability over mere predictive performance,
this study offers a scalable framework to support Vision Zero with aligned
interventions and advanced data-informed traffic safety policy.

Abstract: Enhancing the interpretability of graph neural networks (GNNs) is crucial to
ensure their safe and fair deployment. Recent work has introduced
self-explainable GNNs that generate explanations as part of training, improving
both faithfulness and efficiency. Some of these models, such as ProtGNN and
PGIB, learn class-specific prototypes, offering a potential pathway toward
class-level explanations. However, their evaluations focus solely on
instance-level explanations, leaving open the question of whether these
prototypes meaningfully generalize across instances of the same class. In this
paper, we introduce GraphOracle, a novel self-explainable GNN framework
designed to generate and evaluate class-level explanations for GNNs. Our model
jointly learns a GNN classifier and a set of structured, sparse subgraphs that
are discriminative for each class. We propose a novel integrated training that
captures graph$\unicode{x2013}$subgraph$\unicode{x2013}$prediction dependencies
efficiently and faithfully, validated through a masking-based evaluation
strategy. This strategy enables us to retroactively assess whether prior
methods like ProtGNN and PGIB deliver effective class-level explanations. Our
results show that they do not. In contrast, GraphOracle achieves superior
fidelity, explainability, and scalability across a range of graph
classification tasks. We further demonstrate that GraphOracle avoids the
computational bottlenecks of previous methods$\unicode{x2014}$like Monte Carlo
Tree Search$\unicode{x2014}$by using entropy-regularized subgraph selection and
lightweight random walk extraction, enabling faster and more scalable training.
These findings position GraphOracle as a practical and principled solution for
faithful class-level self-explainability in GNNs.

Abstract: The growing deployment of decision-making agents in dynamic environments
increases the demand for safety verification. While critical testing scenario
generation has emerged as an appealing verification methodology, effectively
balancing diversity and criticality remains a key challenge for existing
methods, particularly due to local optima entrapment in high-dimensional
scenario spaces. To address this limitation, we propose a dual-space guided
testing framework that coordinates scenario parameter space and agent behavior
space, aiming to generate testing scenarios considering diversity and
criticality. Specifically, in the scenario parameter space, a hierarchical
representation framework combines dimensionality reduction and
multi-dimensional subspace evaluation to efficiently localize diverse and
critical subspaces. This guides dynamic coordination between two generation
modes: local perturbation and global exploration, optimizing critical scenario
quantity and diversity. Complementarily, in the agent behavior space,
agent-environment interaction data are leveraged to quantify behavioral
criticality/diversity and adaptively support generation mode switching, forming
a closed feedback loop that continuously enhances scenario characterization and
exploration within the parameter space. Experiments show our framework improves
critical scenario generation by an average of 56.23\% and demonstrates greater
diversity under novel parameter-behavior co-driven metrics when tested on five
decision-making agents, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines.

Motivation: 在无限宽度下，NTK无法描述训练中的关键特性（如NTK演化或特征学习），因此需要引入有限宽度修正。

Method: 通过费曼图简化代数运算，计算有限宽度修正，并推导层间递归关系。

Result: 验证了深度网络的稳定性结果，并证明ReLU等尺度不变非线性在NTK Gram矩阵对角线上无有限宽度修正。

Conclusion: 该方法为分析有限宽度神经网络提供了有效工具，并通过数值实验验证了其可行性。

Abstract: Neural tangent kernels (NTKs) are a powerful tool for analyzing deep,
non-linear neural networks. In the infinite-width limit, NTKs can easily be
computed for most common architectures, yielding full analytic control over the
training dynamics. However, at infinite width, important properties of training
such as NTK evolution or feature learning are absent. Nevertheless, finite
width effects can be included by computing corrections to the Gaussian
statistics at infinite width. We introduce Feynman diagrams for computing
finite-width corrections to NTK statistics. These dramatically simplify the
necessary algebraic manipulations and enable the computation of layer-wise
recursive relations for arbitrary statistics involving preactivations, NTKs and
certain higher-derivative tensors (dNTK and ddNTK) required to predict the
training dynamics at leading order. We demonstrate the feasibility of our
framework by extending stability results for deep networks from preactivations
to NTKs and proving the absence of finite-width corrections for scale-invariant
nonlinearities such as ReLU on the diagonal of the Gram matrix of the NTK. We
validate our results with numerical experiments.

Abstract: We propose an unsupervised anomaly detection approach based on a
physics-informed diffusion model for multivariate time series data. Over the
past years, diffusion model has demonstrated its effectiveness in forecasting,
imputation, generation, and anomaly detection in the time series domain. In
this paper, we present a new approach for learning the physics-dependent
temporal distribution of multivariate time series data using a weighted
physics-informed loss during diffusion model training. A weighted
physics-informed loss is constructed using a static weight schedule. This
approach enables a diffusion model to accurately approximate underlying data
distribution, which can influence the unsupervised anomaly detection
performance. Our experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets show that
physics-informed training improves the F1 score in anomaly detection; it
generates better data diversity and log-likelihood. Our model outperforms
baseline approaches, additionally, it surpasses prior physics-informed work and
purely data-driven diffusion models on a synthetic dataset and one real-world
dataset while remaining competitive on others.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence is reshaping science and industry, yet many users
still regard its models as opaque "black boxes". Conventional explainable
artificial-intelligence methods clarify individual predictions but overlook the
upstream decisions and downstream quality checks that determine whether
insights can be trusted. In this work, we present Holistic Explainable
Artificial Intelligence (HXAI), a user-centric framework that embeds
explanation into every stage of the data-analysis workflow and tailors those
explanations to users. HXAI unifies six components (data, analysis set-up,
learning process, model output, model quality, communication channel) into a
single taxonomy and aligns each component with the needs of domain experts,
data analysts and data scientists. A 112-item question bank covers these needs;
our survey of contemporary tools highlights critical coverage gaps. Grounded in
theories of human explanation, principles from human-computer interaction and
findings from empirical user studies, HXAI identifies the characteristics that
make explanations clear, actionable and cognitively manageable. A comprehensive
taxonomy operationalises these insights, reducing terminological ambiguity and
enabling rigorous coverage analysis of existing toolchains. We further
demonstrate how AI agents that embed large-language models can orchestrate
diverse explanation techniques, translating technical artifacts into
stakeholder-specific narratives that bridge the gap between AI developers and
domain experts. Departing from traditional surveys or perspective articles,
this work melds concepts from multiple disciplines, lessons from real-world
projects and a critical synthesis of the literature to advance a novel,

*Lianshuai Guo,Zhongzheng Yuan,Xunkai Li,Yinlin Zhu,Meixia Qu,Wenyu Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DFed-SST是一种去中心化联邦图学习框架，通过自适应通信机制优化异构环境下的模型聚合。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有去中心化联邦学习（DFL）策略未充分利用局部子图的拓扑信息，而联邦图学习（FGL）主要采用中心化架构，未能发挥去中心化优势。

Method: 提出DFed-SST框架，采用双拓扑自适应通信机制，动态优化客户端间通信拓扑。

Result: 在八个真实数据集上，DFed-SST平均准确率比基线方法提高3.26%。

Conclusion: DFed-SST有效解决了异构环境下的联邦图学习问题，性能显著优于现有方法。

Abstract: Decentralized Federated Learning (DFL) has emerged as a robust distributed
paradigm that circumvents the single-point-of-failure and communication
bottleneck risks of centralized architectures. However, a significant challenge
arises as existing DFL optimization strategies, primarily designed for tasks
such as computer vision, fail to address the unique topological information
inherent in the local subgraph. Notably, while Federated Graph Learning (FGL)
is tailored for graph data, it is predominantly implemented in a centralized
server-client model, failing to leverage the benefits of decentralization.To
bridge this gap, we propose DFed-SST, a decentralized federated graph learning
framework with adaptive communication. The core of our method is a
dual-topology adaptive communication mechanism that leverages the unique
topological features of each client's local subgraph to dynamically construct
and optimize the inter-client communication topology. This allows our framework
to guide model aggregation efficiently in the face of heterogeneity. Extensive
experiments on eight real-world datasets consistently demonstrate the
superiority of DFed-SST, achieving 3.26% improvement in average accuracy over
baseline methods.

Motivation: 利用降阶空间中的层次结构，优先考虑主导模式的相互作用，以改进降阶模型的学习。

Method: 通过嵌套算子推断方法迭代构建初始猜测，并支持动态基和模型形式更新。

Result: 在立方热传导问题中，嵌套算子推断的误差比标准方法小四倍；在格陵兰冰盖模型中，误差为3%，计算速度提升超过19,000倍。

Conclusion: 嵌套算子推断方法在误差和计算效率上显著优于标准方法，适用于动态更新和大规模参数化模型。

Abstract: This paper presents a data-driven, nested Operator Inference (OpInf) approach
for learning physics-informed reduced-order models (ROMs) from snapshot data of
high-dimensional dynamical systems. The approach exploits the inherent
hierarchy within the reduced space to iteratively construct initial guesses for
the OpInf learning problem that prioritize the interactions of the dominant
modes. The initial guess computed for any target reduced dimension corresponds
to a ROM with provably smaller or equal snapshot reconstruction error than with
standard OpInf. Moreover, our nested OpInf algorithm can be warm-started from
previously learned models, enabling versatile application scenarios involving
dynamic basis and model form updates. We demonstrate the performance of our
algorithm on a cubic heat conduction problem, with nested OpInf achieving a
four times smaller error than standard OpInf at a comparable offline time.
Further, we apply nested OpInf to a large-scale, parameterized model of the
Greenland ice sheet where, despite model form approximation errors, it learns a
ROM with, on average, 3% error and computational speed-up factor above 19,000.

TL;DR: SeamlessFlow是一个基于服务器的强化学习框架，解决了工业规模RL中的两个核心挑战：解耦训练与复杂执行流，以及最大化GPU利用率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 工业规模RL中，训练与执行流耦合及GPU利用率低是主要问题。

Method: 引入数据平面解耦训练与代理执行，采用标签驱动调度和时空复用管道优化资源利用。

Result: 实现了稳定性和高性能，适用于多代理、长周期等复杂RL任务。

Conclusion: SeamlessFlow通过创新设计，为大规模RL部署提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: We introduce SeamlessFlow, a server based reinforcement learning (RL)
framework that addresses two core challenges in industrial scale RL: (1)
decoupling RL training from the complex execution flow of agents; (2)
maximizing GPU utilization with minimal idle time while preserving the
stability and scalability required for large-scale deployments. First,
SeamlessFlow introduces a data plane that decouples the RL trainer from
diverse, complex agent implementations while sustaining high throughput. A
central trajectory manager maintains complete interaction histories and
supports partial rollout, allowing rollout to pause for weight updates and
resume seamlessly, keeping agents unaware of service interruptions. Second, we
propose a tag driven scheduling paradigm that abstracts hardware into
capability tagged resources, unifying colocated and disaggregated
architectures. Based on this, SeamlessFlow introduces a spatiotemporal
multiplexing pipeline that dynamically reassigns idle training nodes to rollout
in a train rollout separated setup, eliminating pipeline bubbles and fully
exploiting heterogeneous cluster resources. By combining these innovations,
SeamlessFlow delivers both stability and high performance, making it well
suited for multi agent, long horizon, and other complex RL tasks.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于马尔可夫游戏的范式，用于定量研究不同联盟结构如何影响碳捕获与封存（CCS）项目中各利益相关者的目标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CCS项目涉及多方利益相关者，各自目标不同且地质条件复杂，需要研究协作或独立行动对项目的影响。

Method: 采用多智能体强化学习方法，结合安全约束，利用E2C框架的替代模型降低计算成本。

Result: 结果表明，该框架能有效解决多利益相关者参与时的CO2封存优化管理问题。

Conclusion: 协作联盟结构在CCS项目中更优，能平衡各方利益并确保安全。

Abstract: Carbon capture and storage (CCS) projects typically involve a diverse array
of stakeholders or players from public, private, and regulatory sectors, each
with different objectives and responsibilities. Given the complexity, scale,
and long-term nature of CCS operations, determining whether individual
stakeholders can independently maximize their interests or whether
collaborative coalition agreements are needed remains a central question for
effective CCS project planning and management. CCS projects are often
implemented in geologically connected sites, where shared geological features
such as pressure space and reservoir pore capacity can lead to competitive
behavior among stakeholders. Furthermore, CO2 storage sites are often located
in geologically mature basins that previously served as sites for hydrocarbon
extraction or wastewater disposal in order to leverage existing
infrastructures, which makes unilateral optimization even more complicated and
unrealistic.
  In this work, we propose a paradigm based on Markov games to quantitatively
investigate how different coalition structures affect the goals of
stakeholders. We frame this multi-stakeholder multi-site problem as a
multi-agent reinforcement learning problem with safety constraints. Our
approach enables agents to learn optimal strategies while compliant with safety
regulations. We present an example where multiple operators are injecting CO2
into their respective project areas in a geologically connected basin. To
address the high computational cost of repeated simulations of high-fidelity
models, a previously developed surrogate model based on the Embed-to-Control
(E2C) framework is employed. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of the
proposed framework in addressing optimal management of CO2 storage when
multiple stakeholders with various objectives and goals are involved.

Method: 设计了GPU为中心的SVD算法，包括基于GPU的双对角分治法（BDC），优化BLAS利用率，并引入异步执行机制。

Result: 在AMD MI210和NVIDIA V100 GPU上，相比rocSOLVER/cuSOLVER和MAGMA，分别实现了最高1293.64x/7.47x和14.10x/12.38x的加速。

Conclusion: 该算法通过完全在GPU上执行计算，显著减少了数据传输开销，充分发挥了GPU的计算潜力。

Abstract: Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) is a fundamental matrix factorization
technique in linear algebra, widely applied in numerous matrix-related
problems. However, traditional SVD approaches are hindered by slow panel
factorization and frequent CPU-GPU data transfers in heterogeneous systems,
despite advancements in GPU computational capabilities. In this paper, we
introduce a GPU-centered SVD algorithm, incorporating a novel GPU-based
bidiagonal divide-and-conquer (BDC) method. We reformulate the algorithm and
data layout of different steps for SVD computation, performing all panel-level
computations and trailing matrix updates entirely on GPU to eliminate CPU-GPU
data transfers. Furthermore, we integrate related computations to optimize BLAS
utilization, thereby increasing arithmetic intensity and fully leveraging the
computational capabilities of GPUs. Additionally, we introduce a newly
developed GPU-based BDC algorithm that restructures the workflow to eliminate
matrix-level CPU-GPU data transfers and enable asynchronous execution between
the CPU and GPU. Experimental results on AMD MI210 and NVIDIA V100 GPUs
demonstrate that our proposed method achieves speedups of up to 1293.64x/7.47x
and 14.10x/12.38x compared to rocSOLVER/cuSOLVER and MAGMA, respectively.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着数据集规模超过本地存储容量，GPU计算能力超过网络和磁盘延迟，大规模深度学习任务面临I/O瓶颈和能源消耗问题。

Method: EMLIO在存储节点上部署轻量级数据服务守护进程，通过序列化和批量处理原始样本，结合TCP流传输和乱序预取技术，并与GPU加速预处理无缝集成。

Result: 在本地磁盘、局域网和广域网环境中，EMLIO实现了8.6倍的I/O速度提升和10.9倍的能源消耗降低。

Conclusion: EMLIO为下一代AI云提供了可扩展的能源感知I/O架构。

Abstract: Large-scale deep learning workloads increasingly suffer from I/O bottlenecks
as datasets grow beyond local storage capacities and GPU compute outpaces
network and disk latencies. While recent systems optimize data-loading time,
they overlook the energy cost of I/O - a critical factor at large scale. We
introduce EMLIO, an Efficient Machine Learning I/O service that jointly
minimizes end-to-end data-loading latency T and I/O energy consumption E across
variable-latency networked storage. EMLIO deploys a lightweight data-serving
daemon on storage nodes that serializes and batches raw samples, streams them
over TCP with out-of-order prefetching, and integrates seamlessly with
GPU-accelerated (NVIDIA DALI) preprocessing on the client side. In exhaustive
evaluations over local disk, LAN (0.05 ms & 10 ms RTT), and WAN (30 ms RTT)
environments, EMLIO delivers up to 8.6X faster I/O and 10.9X lower energy use
compared to state-of-the-art loaders, while maintaining constant performance
and energy profiles irrespective of network distance. EMLIO's service-based
architecture offers a scalable blueprint for energy-aware I/O in
next-generation AI clouds.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统框架难以交易或分割大型、异质化的资产（如矿山、发电厂），需要新的解决方案。

Method: 引入元素代币（标准化、抵押的资产组成部分）和整体代币（资产的固定组合），支持双向转换和套利机制。

Result: 通过能源和工业案例验证，该架构能像股票或ETF一样分割和交易高价值项目。

Conclusion: 该方案降低了投资门槛，改善了价格发现，但需考虑实施和监管问题。

Abstract: Alternative assets such as mines, power plants, or infrastructure projects
are often large, heterogeneous bundles of resources, rights, and outputs whose
value is difficult to trade or fractionalize under traditional frameworks. This
paper proposes a novel two-tier tokenization architecture to enhance the
liquidity and transparency of such complex assets. We introduce the concepts of
Element Tokens and Everything Tokens: elemental tokens represent standardized,
fully collateralized components of an asset (e.g., outputs, rights, or
credits), while an everything token represents the entire asset as a fixed
combination of those elements. The architecture enables both fine-grained
partial ownership and integrated whole-asset ownership through a system of
two-way convertibility. We detail the design and mechanics of this system,
including an arbitrage mechanism that keeps the price of the composite token
aligned with the net asset value of its constituents. Through illustrative
examples in the energy and industrial sectors, we demonstrate that our approach
allows previously illiquid, high-value projects to be fractionalized and traded
akin to stocks or exchange-traded funds (ETFs). We discuss the benefits for
investors and asset owners, such as lower entry barriers, improved price
discovery, and flexible financing, as well as the considerations for
implementation and regulation.

Abstract: The ever-increasing compute performance of GPU accelerators drives up the
need for efficient data movements within HPC applications to sustain
performance. Proposed as a solution to alleviate CPU-GPU data movement, AMD
MI300A Accelerated Processing Unit (APU) combines CPU, GPU, and high-bandwidth
memory (HBM) within a single physical package. Leadership supercomputers, such
as El Capitan, group four APUs within a single compute node, using Infinity
Fabric Interconnect. In this work, we design specific benchmarks to evaluate
direct memory access from the GPU, explicit inter-APU data movement, and
collective multi-APU communication. We also compare the efficiency of HIP APIs,
MPI routines, and the GPU-specialized RCCL library. Our results highlight key
design choices for optimizing inter-APU communication on multi-APU AMD MI300A
systems with Infinity Fabric, including programming interfaces, allocators, and
data movement. Finally, we optimize two real HPC applications, Quicksilver and
CloverLeaf, and evaluate them on a four MI100A APU system.

Motivation: 研究精确多数共识问题，以设计在通用图中高效且稳定的协议。

Method: 通过分析随机游走的松弛时间和图的度不平衡，设计新的协议，优化时间和空间复杂度。

Result: 提出了一个协议，在期望和高概率下稳定时间为O(Δ/δ τ_rel log²n)，空间复杂度为O(logn (log(Δ/δ) + log(τ_rel/n)))。

Conclusion: 在正则扩展图中，协议达到了最优空间复杂度和接近最优的稳定时间，同时为常数状态协议提供了新的上界。

Abstract: We study exact majority consensus in the population protocol model. In this
model, the system is described by a graph $G = (V,E)$ with $n$ nodes, and in
each time step, a scheduler samples uniformly at random a pair of adjacent
nodes to interact. In the exact majority consensus task, each node is given a
binary input, and the goal is to design a protocol that almost surely reaches a
stable configuration, where all nodes output the majority input value.
  We give improved upper and lower bounds for the exact majority in general
graphs. First, we give asymptotically tight time lower bounds for general
(unbounded space) protocols. Second, we obtain new upper bounds parameterized
by the relaxation time $\tau_{\mathsf{rel}}$ of the random walk on $G$ induced
by the scheduler and the degree imbalance $\Delta/\delta$ of $G$. Specifically,
we give a protocol that stabilizes in $O\left( \tfrac{\Delta}{\delta}
\tau_{\mathsf{rel}} \log^2 n \right)$ steps in expectation and with high
probability and uses $O\left( \log n \cdot \left(
\log\left(\tfrac{\Delta}{\delta}\right) + \log
\left(\tfrac{\tau_{\mathsf{rel}}}{n}\right) \right) \right)$ states in any
graph with minimum degree at least $\delta$ and maximum degree at most
$\Delta$.
  For regular expander graphs, this matches the optimal space complexity of
$\Theta(\log n)$ for fast protocols in complete graphs [Alistarh et al., SODA
2016 and Doty et al., FOCS 2022] with a nearly optimal stabilization time of
$O(n \log^2 n)$ steps. Finally, we give a new upper bound of
$O(\tau_{\mathsf{rel}} \cdot n \log n)$ for the stabilization time of a
constant-state protocol.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: TSO内存模型通过存储缓冲优化了多处理器效率，但增加了正确性推理的复杂性，需要昂贵的同步操作。本文旨在明确何时必须使用这些操作。

Method: 引入TSO特定的‘occurs-before’关系，并证明事件间时间顺序的唯一方式是通过‘occurs-before’链。分析了内存屏障和原子操作在创建这种链中的作用。

Result: 提出了一个定理，证明事件间时间顺序的唯一方式是‘occurs-before’链，并确定了同步操作不可避免的情况。

Conclusion: 该研究为TSO模型提供了理论基础，扩展了异步系统的通信推理方法，并推广了共享内存对象线性化实现的下界。

Abstract: The Total Store Order (TSO) is arguably the most widely used relaxed memory
model in multiprocessor architectures, widely implemented, for example in
Intel's x86 and x64 platforms. It allows processes to delay the visibility of
writes through store buffering. While this supports hardware-level
optimizations and makes a significant contribution to multiprocessor
efficiency, it complicates reasoning about correctness, as executions may
violate sequential consistency. Ensuring correct behavior often requires
inserting synchronization primitives such as memory fences ($F$) or atomic
read-modify-write ($RMW$) operations, but this approach can incur significant
performance costs. In this work, we develop a semantic framework that precisely
characterizes when such synchronization is necessary under TSO. We introduce a
novel TSO-specific occurs-before relation, which adapts Lamport's celebrated
happens-before relation from asynchronous message-passing systems to the TSO
setting. Our main result is a theorem that proves that the only way to ensure
that two events that take place at different sites are temporally ordered is by
having the execution create an occurs-before chain between the events. By
studying the role of fences and $RMW$s in creating occurs-before chains, we are
then able to capture cases in which these costly synchronization operations are
unavoidable. Since proper real-time ordering of events is a fundamental aspect
of consistency conditions such as Linearizability, our analysis provides a
sound theoretical understanding of essential aspects of the TSO model. In
particular, we are able to generalize prior lower bounds for linearizable
implementations of shared memory objects. Our results capture the structure of
information flow and causality in the TSO model by extending the standard
communication-based reasoning from asynchronous systems to the TSO memory
model.

Conclusion: ELIB和MBU为边缘设备部署LLM提供优化指导。

Abstract: With the significant success achieved by large language models (LLMs) like
LLaMA, edge computing-based LLM inference services for mobile and PC are in
high demand for data privacy. However, different edge platforms have different
hardware characteristics and the large demand for memory capacity and bandwidth
makes it very challenging to deploy and benchmark LLMs on edge devices. In this
paper, we introduce a benchmarking tool named ELIB (edge LLM inference
benchmarking) to evaluate LLM inference performance of different edge
platforms, and propose a novel metric named MBU to indicate the percentage of
the theoretically efficient use of available memory bandwidth for a specific
model running on edge hardware to optimize memory usage. We deploy ELIB on
three edge platforms and benchmark using five quantized models to optimize MBU
in combination with other metrics such as FLOPS, throughput, latency and
accuracy. And we analyze the results to derive the key factors, constraints,
unpredictability in optimizing MBU that can guide deploying LLMs on more edge
platforms.

Motivation: 由于缺乏原生支持CXL.mem协议的SSD硬件，现有方法无法准确模拟CXL-SSD的性能关键因素，如固件级交互和存储动态。

Method: OpenCXD将主机的周期精确CXL.mem模拟器与运行真实固件的物理OpenSSD平台结合，实现固件级的实时执行。

Result: OpenCXD能够反映仅靠模拟无法观察到的设备级现象，为未来CXL-SSD固件设计提供关键见解。

Conclusion: OpenCXD填补了模拟与硬件之间的差距，为CXL-SSD的性能评估提供了更真实的解决方案。

Abstract: The advent of Compute Express Link (CXL) enables SSDs to participate in the
memory hierarchy as large-capacity, byte-addressable memory devices. These
CXL-enabled SSDs (CXL-SSDs) offer a promising new tier between DRAM and
traditional storage, combining NAND flash density with memory-like access
semantics. However, evaluating the performance of CXL-SSDs remains difficult
due to the lack of hardware that natively supports the CXL.mem protocol on
SSDs. As a result, most prior work relies on hybrid simulators combining CPU
models augmented with CXL.mem semantics and SSD simulators that approximate
internal flash behaviors. While effective for early-stage exploration, this
approach cannot faithfully model firmware-level interactions and low-level
storage dynamics critical to CXL-SSD performance. In this paper, we present
OpenCXD, a real-device-guided hybrid evaluation framework that bridges the gap
between simulation and hardware. OpenCXD integrates a cycle-accurate CXL.mem
simulator on the host side with a physical OpenSSD platform running real
firmware. This enables in-situ firmware execution triggered by simulated memory
requests. Through these contributions, OpenCXD reflects device-level phenomena
unobservable in simulation-only setups, providing critical insights for future
firmware design tailored to CXL-SSDs.
