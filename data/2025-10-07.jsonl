Training a\ndiffusion model consists of learning how to denoise noisy samples at different\nnoise levels. When training diffusion models for point clouds such as molecules\nand proteins, there is often no canonical orientation that can be assigned. To\ncapture this symmetry, the true data samples are often augmented by\ntransforming them with random rotations sampled uniformly over $SO(3)$. Then,\nthe denoised predictions are often rotationally aligned via the Kabsch-Umeyama\nalgorithm to the ground truth samples before computing the loss. However, the\neffect of this alignment step has not been well studied. Here, we show that the\noptimal denoiser can be expressed in terms of a matrix Fisher distribution over\n$SO(3)$.

In BEKAN,\nwe propose three distinct and combinable approaches for incorporating\nDirichlet, periodic, and Neumann boundary conditions into the network. For\nDirichlet problem, we use smooth and global Gaussian RBFs to construct\nunivariate basis functions for approximating the solution and to encode\nboundary information at the activation level of the network. To handle periodic\nproblems, we employ a periodic layer constructed from a set of sinusoidal\nfunctions to enforce the boundary conditions exactly. For a Neumann problem, we\ndevise a least-squares formulation to guide the parameter evolution toward\nsatisfying the Neumann condition. By virtue of the boundary-embedded RBFs, the\nperiodic layer, and the evolutionary framework, we can perform accurate PDE\nsimulations while rigorously enforcing boundary conditions. For demonstration,\nwe conducted extensive numerical experiments on Dirichlet, Neumann, periodic,\nand mixed boundary value problems. The results indicate that BEKAN outperforms\nboth multilayer perceptron (MLP) and B-splines KAN in terms of accuracy. In\nconclusion, the proposed approach enhances the capability of KANs in solving\nPDE problems while satisfying boundary conditions, thereby facilitating\nadvancements in scientific computing and engineering applications."}

Previously, we devised an \"enriched\" chart review protocol where a\n\"roadmap\" of auxiliary diagnoses (anchors) was used to recover missing values\nin EHR data (e.g., a diagnosis of impaired glycemic control might imply that a\nmissing hemoglobin A1c value would be considered unhealthy). Still, chart\nreviews are expensive and time-intensive, which limits the number of patients\nwhose data can be reviewed. Now, we investigate the accuracy and scalability of\na roadmap-driven algorithm, based on ICD-10 codes (International Classification\nof Diseases, 10th revision), to mimic expert chart reviews and recover missing\nvalues. Materials and Methods: In addition to the clinicians' original roadmap\nfrom our previous work, we consider new versions that were iteratively refined\nusing large language models (LLM) in conjunction with clinical expertise to\nexpand the list of auxiliary diagnoses. Using chart reviews for 100 patients\nfrom the EHR at an extensive learning health system, we examine algorithm\nperformance with different roadmaps. Using the larger study of $1000$ patients,\nwe applied the final algorithm, which used a roadmap with clinician-approved\nadditions from the LLM. Results: The algorithm recovered as much, if not more,\nmissing data as the expert chart reviewers, depending on the roadmap.\nDiscussion: Clinically-driven algorithms (enhanced by LLM) can recover missing\nEHR data with similar accuracy to chart reviews and can feasibly be applied to\nlarge samples. Extending them to monitor other dimensions of data quality\n(e.g., plausability) is a promising future direction."}

We attribute this\nphenomenon to the widespread use of the reverse Kullback-Leibler (KL)\ndivergence regularizer, whose mode-seeking behavior keeps the policy trapped\ninside the base model's support region and hampers wider exploration. To\naddress this issue, we propose RAPO (Rewards-Aware Policy Optimization), an\nalgorithm to promote broader yet focused exploration.

This\napproach is practical and efficient: it leverages the ease of generating\nabundant reasoning data from stronger models and provides a direct, data-driven\nway to teach less capable models better reasoning. While previous work has\nlargely focused on prompt selection with responses from a single teacher, the\nequally important problem of choosing the best response when multiple teacher\noutputs are available for a single prompt remains underexplored. This challenge\nbecomes important in a multi-teacher setting, where different students may\nbenefit from the outputs of different teachers. This paper fills that gap with\na systematic study of response selection for reasoning distillation. We first\nshow that the current method, which picks responses the student assigns the\nhighest global log-probability (global naturalness), fails when responses come\nfrom multiple teachers, i.e., global naturalness no longer correlates with\ndownstream performance, especially as the reasoning traces from strong teachers\nbecome longer.

Some studies contend that RLVR mainly improves\nsampling efficiency but at the expense of diversity and exploratory capacity,\nresulting in capability boundary shrinkage.

To reconcile these\ncontradictory findings, we theoretically and empirically show that both\nperspectives are partially valid-each aligning with a separate phase in an\ninherent two-stage probability mass dynamic: (1) Exploitation stage: initially,\nthe model primarily samples explored high-reward and low-reward tokens, while\nrarely selecting the potentially optimal token. Positive advantage estimates\nincrease the probability of high-reward tokens and decrease those of low-reward\ntokens, yet the optimal token's probability remains largely unchanged during\nthis stage. (2) Exploration stage: as training advances, the growth rate of\npreviously acquired high-reward tokens slows as their probabilities approach\nsaturation. When a potentially optimal token-now receiving positive advantage\nestimates-is occasionally sampled, its probability increases, while those of\nthe originally high-reward tokens decrease. This dynamic suggests that\nover-exploitation during the exploitation stage may lead to capability boundary\nshrinkage, whereas prolonged training into the exploration stage can promote an\nexpansion of the reasoning capability boundary. Building upon our insights, we\nrevisit the potential of only using relative negative gradients for prolonging\ntraining, providing a theoretical and empirical foundation for the development\nof more advanced reasoning capabilities."}

A prominent line of recent\nwork leverages learned policies as proposal distributions for Model-Predictive\nPath Integral (MPPI) planning. Initial approaches update the sampling policy\nindependently of the planner distribution, typically maximizing a learned value\nfunction with deterministic policy gradient and entropy regularization.\nHowever, because the states encountered during training depend on the MPPI\nplanner, aligning the sampling policy with the planner improves the accuracy of\nvalue estimation and long-term performance.

However, the corresponding model weight changes (\"weight diffs\") are\nnot generally interpretable. While inspecting the finetuning dataset can give a\nsense of how the model might have changed, these datasets are often not\npublicly available or are too large to work with directly. Towards the goal of\ncomprehensively understanding weight diffs in natural language, we introduce\nDiff Interpretation Tuning (DIT), a method that trains models to describe their\nown finetuning-induced modifications. Our approach uses synthetic, labeled\nweight diffs to train a DIT adapter, which can be applied to a compatible\nfinetuned model to make it describe how it has changed. We demonstrate in two\nproof-of-concept settings (reporting hidden behaviors and summarizing finetuned\nknowledge) that our method enables models to describe their finetuning-induced\nmodifications using accurate natural language descriptions."}

Yet aligning LRMs with human preferences, a crucial prerequisite for\nmodel deployment, remains underexplored. The statistically correct objective\nfor preference alignment requires marginalizing over reasoning traces, but this\ncomputation is intractable in practice. A common workaround optimizes a single\nsampled trajectory, which introduces substantial gradient variance from\nstochastic trace sampling. To address this challenge, we frame preference\noptimization for LRMs through the lens of the bias--variance trade-off and\npropose Bias--Variance Optimized Preference Optimization (BVPO), a simple,\ndrop-in method that mixes two gradient estimators: a high-variance trace-based\nestimator and a low-variance empty-trace estimator obtained by disabling\nreasoning trace generation. Our theory shows that BVPO strictly reduces\ntrace-induced variance for any nontrivial mixture, provides a closed-form\nchoice of the mixing weight that minimizes mean-squared error relative to the\ntrue marginal gradient, and under standard smoothness and step-size conditions,\ntightens classical convergence bounds for stochastic gradient descent.\nEmpirically, BVPO improves alignment over the best baseline by up to 7.8 points\non AlpacaEval~2 and 6.8 points on Arena-Hard. Despite being trained only on\ngeneral conversational data, BVPO also boosts reasoning performance for base\nmodels by up to 4.0 points on the average of six math reasoning benchmarks.\nThese results identify variance from trace sampling as a key bottleneck and\ndemonstrate that directly optimizing the bias--variance trade-off yields more\nstable training and stronger overall performance."}

Recently, intrinsically interpretable\nGNNs have been studied to provide insights into model predictions by\nidentifying rationale substructures in graphs. However, existing methods face\nchallenges when the underlying rationale subgraphs are complex and varied. In\nthis work, we propose TopInG: Topologically Interpretable Graph Learning, a\nnovel topological framework that leverages persistent homology to identify\npersistent rationale subgraphs. TopInG employs a rationale filtration learning\napproach to model an autoregressive generation process of rationale subgraphs,\nand introduces a self-adjusted topological constraint, termed topological\ndiscrepancy, to enforce a persistent topological distinction between rationale\nsubgraphs and irrelevant counterparts. We provide theoretical guarantees that\nour loss function is uniquely optimized by the ground truth under specific\nconditions. Extensive experiments demonstrate TopInG's effectiveness in\ntackling key challenges, such as handling variform rationale subgraphs,\nbalancing predictive performance with interpretability, and mitigating spurious\ncorrelations. Results show that our approach improves upon state-of-the-art\nmethods on both predictive accuracy and interpretation quality."}
