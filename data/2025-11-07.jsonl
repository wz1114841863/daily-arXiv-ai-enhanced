However, the use of\ninternet-scale, often proprietary, pretraining corpora raises a critical\nconcern for both practitioners and users: inflated performance due to test-set\nleakage. While prior works have proposed mitigation strategies such as\ndecontamination of pretraining data and benchmark redesign for LLMs, the\ncomplementary direction of developing detection methods for contaminated VLMs\nremains underexplored. To address this gap, we deliberately contaminate\nopen-source VLMs on popular benchmarks and show that existing detection\napproaches either fail outright or exhibit inconsistent behavior. We then\npropose a novel simple yet effective detection method based on multi-modal\nsemantic perturbation, demonstrating that contaminated models fail to\ngeneralize under controlled perturbations. Finally, we validate our approach\nacross multiple realistic contamination strategies, confirming its robustness\nand effectiveness. The code and perturbed dataset will be released publicly."}

Once a network has been trained, however, its\nmemory- and compute-footprint can be reduced by compression. In this work, we\nfocus on compression through tensorization and low-rank representations.\nWhereas classical approaches search for a low-rank approximation by minimizing\nan isotropic norm such as the Frobenius norm in weight-space, we use\ndata-informed norms that measure the error in function space. Concretely, we\nminimize the change in the layer's output distribution, which can be expressed\nas $\\lVert (W - \\widetilde{W}) \\Sigma^{1/2}\\rVert_F$ where $\\Sigma^{1/2}$ is\nthe square root of the covariance matrix of the layer's input and $W$,\n$\\widetilde{W}$ are the original and compressed weights.

Unlike previous work that focused primarily on\nloop-level transformations, OMPILOT operates at the function level to capture a\nwider semantic context. To evaluate our approach, we propose OMPBLEU, a novel\ncomposite metric specifically crafted to assess the correctness and quality of\nOpenMP parallel constructs, addressing limitations in conventional translation\nmetrics."}

However, the pursuit of higher\nperformance necessitates more complex circuit designs and increased operating\nfrequencies, which exacerbate IR-drop issues. Severe IR-drop can significantly\ndegrade chip performance and even threaten reliability. Conventional\ncircuit-level IR-drop mitigation methods, such as back-end optimizations, are\nresource-intensive and often compromise power, performance, and area (PPA). To\naddress these challenges, we propose AIM, comprehensive software and hardware\nco-design for architecture-level IR-drop mitigation in high-performance PIM.\nInitially, leveraging the bit-serial and in-situ dataflow processing properties\nof PIM, we introduce Rtog and HR, which establish a direct correlation between\nPIM workloads and IR-drop. Building on this foundation, we propose LHR and WDS,\nenabling extensive exploration of architecture-level IR-drop mitigation while\nmaintaining computational accuracy through software optimization. Subsequently,\nwe develop IR-Booster, a dynamic adjustment mechanism that integrates\nsoftware-level HR information with hardware-based IR-drop monitoring to adapt\nthe V-f pairs of the PIM macro, achieving enhanced energy efficiency and\nperformance. Finally, we propose the HR-aware task mapping method, bridging\nsoftware and hardware designs to achieve optimal improvement. Post-layout\nsimulation results on a 7nm 256-TOPS PIM chip demonstrate that AIM achieves up\nto 69.2% IR-drop mitigation, resulting in 2.29x energy efficiency improvement\nand 1.152x speedup."}
