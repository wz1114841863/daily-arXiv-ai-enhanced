### [1] [Some Attention is All You Need for Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19861)
*Felix Michalak,Steven Abreu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 在混合SSM-Transformer架构中，检索功能完全由自注意力层承担，而SSM层没有补偿机制。仅保留15%注意力头就能维持近乎完美的检索性能，同时保留84%的MMLU性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究混合SSM-Transformer架构中的功能分离现象，挑战关于混合架构冗余性的假设。

Method: 通过注意力消融实验和稀疏化实验，在RecurrentGemma-2B/9B和Jamba-Mini-1.6模型上测试检索性能。

Result: 注意力消融导致检索完全失败（0%准确率），而仅保留15%注意力头就能维持近乎完美的检索性能。SSM层没有表现出任何补偿机制。

Conclusion: 混合架构中的自注意力层专门负责检索任务，这些模型更像是专门模块而非集成系统，对架构优化和可解释性有重要影响。

Abstract: We demonstrate complete functional segregation in hybrid SSM-Transformer
architectures: retrieval depends exclusively on self-attention layers. Across
RecurrentGemma-2B/9B and Jamba-Mini-1.6, attention ablation causes catastrophic
retrieval failure (0% accuracy), while SSM layers show no compensatory
mechanisms even with improved prompting. Conversely, sparsifying attention to
just 15% of heads maintains near-perfect retrieval while preserving 84% MMLU
performance, suggesting self-attention specializes primarily for retrieval
tasks. We identify precise mechanistic requirements for retrieval: needle
tokens must be exposed during generation and sufficient context must be
available during prefill or generation. This strict functional specialization
challenges assumptions about redundancy in hybrid architectures and suggests
these models operate as specialized modules rather than integrated systems,
with immediate implications for architecture optimization and interpretability.

### [2] [An Integrated Approach to Neural Architecture Search for Deep Q-Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19872)
*Iman Rahmani,Saman Yazdannik,Morteza Tayefi,Jafar Roshanian*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: NAS-DQN通过在线神经架构搜索实现动态网络重构，在深度强化学习中超越固定架构设计，获得更好的最终性能、样本效率和策略稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统深度强化学习代理的神经网络架构通常通过昂贵的超参数搜索确定后固定不变，这限制了性能。本研究探索在线自适应架构优化是否能突破这一限制。

Method: 引入NAS-DQN代理，将学习到的神经架构搜索控制器直接集成到DRL训练循环中，基于累积性能反馈实现动态网络重构。

Result: NAS-DQN在连续控制任务中优于三个固定架构基线和随机搜索控制，实现了更优的最终性能、样本效率和策略稳定性，且计算开销可忽略。

Conclusion: 架构自适应对于在线深度强化学习的最优样本效率不仅是有益的，而且是必要的，RL代理的设计可以无缝集成为学习过程本身的动态组件。

Abstract: The performance of deep reinforcement learning agents is fundamentally
constrained by their neural network architecture, a choice traditionally made
through expensive hyperparameter searches and then fixed throughout training.
This work investigates whether online, adaptive architecture optimization can
escape this constraint and outperform static designs. We introduce NAS-DQN, an
agent that integrates a learned neural architecture search controller directly
into the DRL training loop, enabling dynamic network reconfiguration based on
cumulative performance feedback. We evaluate NAS-DQN against three
fixed-architecture baselines and a random search control on a continuous
control task, conducting experiments over multiple random seeds. Our results
demonstrate that NAS-DQN achieves superior final performance, sample
efficiency, and policy stability while incurring negligible computational
overhead. Critically, the learned search strategy substantially outperforms
both undirected random architecture exploration and poorly-chosen fixed
designs, indicating that intelligent, performance-guided search is the key
mechanism driving success. These findings establish that architecture
adaptation is not merely beneficial but necessary for optimal sample efficiency
in online deep reinforcement learning, and suggest that the design of RL agents
need not be a static offline choice but can instead be seamlessly integrated as
a dynamic component of the learning process itself.

### [3] [From Large to Small: Transferring CUDA Optimization Expertise via Reasoning Graph](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19873)
*Junfeng Gong,Zhiyi Wei,Junying Chen,Cheng Liu,Huawei Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ReGraphT是一个无需训练、基于检索增强生成的框架，通过构建CUDA优化轨迹图和使用蒙特卡洛图搜索，将LLM级推理能力转移到小型模型上，使SLM在CUDA代码生成任务中接近LLM性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然大型语言模型在生成优化CUDA代码方面表现出色，但存在代码泄露风险和计算成本高的问题。小型语言模型虽然轻量且隐私友好，但在复杂CUDA生成任务中推理能力有限。

Method: 将CUDA优化轨迹组织成结构化推理图，将组合优化建模为状态转换，利用蒙特卡洛图搜索进行高效探索，构建了按推理复杂度分层的CUDA专用基准。

Result: ReGraphT在CUDAEval和ParEval上平均实现了2.33倍加速，优于HPC专用微调模型和其他检索增强方法，使SLM接近LLM性能水平。

Conclusion: ReGraphT框架成功地将LLM级推理能力转移到SLM，解决了隐私风险和计算开销问题，为高效CUDA代码生成提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Despite significant evolution of CUDA programming and domain-specific
libraries, effectively utilizing GPUs with massively parallel engines remains
difficult. Large language models (LLMs) show strong potential in generating
optimized CUDA code from sequential code. However, using LLMs in practice faces
two major challenges: cloud-based APIs pose risks of code leakage, and local
deployment is often computationally expensive and inefficient. These drawbacks
have spurred interest in small language models (SLMs), which are more
lightweight and privacy-friendly. Encouragingly, recent studies show that SLMs
can achieve performance comparable to LLMs on specific tasks. While SLMs can
match LLMs on domain-specific tasks, their limited reasoning abilities lead to
suboptimal performance in complex CUDA generation according to our experiments.
To bridge this gap, we propose ReGraphT, a training-free, retrieval-augmented
generation framework that transfers LLM-level reasoning to smaller models.
ReGraphT organizes CUDA optimization trajectories into a structured reasoning
graph, modeling the combined CUDA optimizations as state transitions, and
leverages Monte Carlo Graph Search (MCGS) for efficient exploration. We also
present a CUDA-specific benchmark with difficulty tiers defined by reasoning
complexity to evaluate models more comprehensively. Experiments show that
ReGraphT outperforms HPC-specific fine-tuned models and other
retrieval-augmented approaches, achieving an average 2.33X speedup on CUDAEval
and ParEval. When paired with DeepSeek-Coder-V2-Lite-Instruct and
Qwen2.5-Coder-7B-Instruct, ReGraphT enables SLMs to approach LLM-level
performance without the associated privacy risks or excessive computing
overhead.

### [4] [From Optimization to Prediction: Transformer-Based Path-Flow Estimation to the Traffic Assignment Problem](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19889)
*Mostafa Ameli,Van Anh Le,Sulthana Shams,Alexander Skabardonis*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出基于Transformer架构的深度学习模型，直接预测均衡路径流量，大幅降低计算时间，适应需求变化和网络结构调整。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统交通分配问题的数学规划方法在大规模网络中计算复杂度呈非线性增长，计算成本过高。

Method: 使用Transformer架构的深度神经网络，通过路径级交通分布捕捉OD对间的复杂相关性，实现均衡路径流量的直接预测。

Result: 在多个网络上进行数值实验，证明该方法比传统优化方法快数个数量级，能有效估计多类网络中的路径级交通流量，提高预测精度。

Conclusion: 该模型能灵活适应变化的需求和网络条件，支持交通管理，实现快速的情景分析，提升交通规划和政策制定能力。

Abstract: The traffic assignment problem is essential for traffic flow analysis,
traditionally solved using mathematical programs under the Equilibrium
principle. These methods become computationally prohibitive for large-scale
networks due to non-linear growth in complexity with the number of OD pairs.
This study introduces a novel data-driven approach using deep neural networks,
specifically leveraging the Transformer architecture, to predict equilibrium
path flows directly. By focusing on path-level traffic distribution, the
proposed model captures intricate correlations between OD pairs, offering a
more detailed and flexible analysis compared to traditional link-level
approaches. The Transformer-based model drastically reduces computation time,
while adapting to changes in demand and network structure without the need for
recalculation. Numerical experiments are conducted on the Manhattan-like
synthetic network, the Sioux Falls network, and the Eastern-Massachusetts
network. The results demonstrate that the proposed model is orders of magnitude
faster than conventional optimization. It efficiently estimates path-level
traffic flows in multi-class networks, reducing computational costs and
improving prediction accuracy by capturing detailed trip and flow information.
The model also adapts flexibly to varying demand and network conditions,
supporting traffic management and enabling rapid `what-if' analyses for
enhanced transportation planning and policy-making.

### [5] [ADP-VRSGP: Decentralized Learning with Adaptive Differential Privacy via Variance-Reduced Stochastic Gradient Push](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20157)
*Xiaoming Wu,Teng Liu,Xin Wang,Ming Yang,Jiguo Yu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出ADP-VRSGP方法，通过自适应调整噪声方差和学习率的步进衰减策略，在保护隐私的同时提升去中心化学习的训练效率和模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有使用固定方差噪声的去中心化学习方法会降低模型性能和训练效率，需要一种能动态调整噪声和学习率的自适应方法。

Method: 采用自适应差分隐私方法，结合方差缩减随机梯度推送技术，使用步进衰减策略动态调整噪声方差和学习率，并引入渐进梯度融合策略利用历史梯度。

Result: 理论分析表明ADP-VRSGP能实现鲁棒收敛，实验结果显示该方法在多种场景下优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: ADP-VRSGP有效解决了隐私保护去中心化学习中的挑战，显著提升了训练稳定性和速度。

Abstract: Differential privacy is widely employed in decentralized learning to
safeguard sensitive data by introducing noise into model updates. However,
existing approaches that use fixed-variance noise often degrade model
performance and reduce training efficiency. To address these limitations, we
propose a novel approach called decentralized learning with adaptive
differential privacy via variance-reduced stochastic gradient push (ADP-VRSGP).
This method dynamically adjusts both the noise variance and the learning rate
using a stepwise-decaying schedule, which accelerates training and enhances
final model performance while providing node-level personalized privacy
guarantees. To counteract the slowed convergence caused by large-variance noise
in early iterations, we introduce a progressive gradient fusion strategy that
leverages historical gradients. Furthermore, ADP-VRSGP incorporates
decentralized push-sum and aggregation techniques, making it particularly
suitable for time-varying communication topologies. Through rigorous
theoretical analysis, we demonstrate that ADP-VRSGP achieves robust convergence
with an appropriate learning rate, significantly improving training stability
and speed. Experimental results validate that our method outperforms existing
baselines across multiple scenarios, highlighting its efficacy in addressing
the challenges of privacy-preserving decentralized learning.

### [6] [FairGRPO: Fair Reinforcement Learning for Equitable Clinical Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19893)
*Shiqi Dai,Wei Dai,Jiaee Cheong,Paul Pu Liang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FairGRPO是一种分层强化学习方法，通过自适应重要性加权和自动发现潜在人口群体来解决医疗AI系统中的公平性问题，显著减少了预测偏差并提高了诊断性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医疗AI系统在诊断能力上表现出色，但存在跨人口群体的性能差异，对少数群体造成实际伤害。多模态推理基础模型虽然推进了临床诊断，但通过强化学习训练时会继承并放大训练数据中的偏见。

Method: FairGRPO采用分层强化学习方法，基于代表性、任务难度和数据来源对优势进行自适应重要性加权。当临床数据缺乏人口统计标签时，使用无监督聚类自动发现潜在的人口群体。

Result: 在7个临床诊断数据集上的实验表明，FairGRPO相比所有基准方法减少了27.2%的预测偏差，同时F1分数提高了12.49%。训练动态分析显示FairGRPO在整个优化过程中持续改善公平性。

Conclusion: FairGRPO有效解决了医疗AI中的公平性问题，并基于此发布了FairMedGemma-4B模型，在保持最先进性能的同时显著减少了跨人口群体的差异。

Abstract: Medical artificial intelligence systems have achieved remarkable diagnostic
capabilities, yet they consistently exhibit performance disparities across
demographic groups, causing real-world harm to underrepresented populations.
While recent multimodal reasoning foundation models have advanced clinical
diagnosis through integrated analysis of diverse medical data, reasoning
trainings via reinforcement learning inherit and often amplify biases present
in training datasets dominated by majority populations. We introduce
Fairness-aware Group Relative Policy Optimization (FairGRPO), a hierarchical
reinforcement learning approach that promotes equitable learning across
heterogeneous clinical populations. FairGRPO employs adaptive importance
weighting of advantages based on representation, task difficulty, and data
source. To address the common issue of missing demographic labels in the
clinical domain, we further employ unsupervised clustering, which automatically
discovers latent demographic groups when labels are unavailable. Through
comprehensive experiments across 7 clinical diagnostic datasets spanning 5
clinical modalities across X-ray, CT scan, dermoscropy, mammography and
ultrasound, we demonstrate that FairGRPO reduces predictive parity by 27.2%
against all vanilla and bias mitigated RL baselines, while improving F1 score
by 12.49%. Furthermore, training dynamics analysis reveals that FairGRPO
progressively improves fairness throughout optimization, while baseline RL
methods exhibit deteriorating fairness as training progresses. Based on
FairGRPO, we release FairMedGemma-4B, a fairness-aware clinical VLLM that
achieves state-of-the-art performance while demonstrating significantly reduced
disparities across demographic groups.

### [7] [Enhancing Diagnostic Accuracy for Urinary Tract Disease through Explainable SHAP-Guided Feature Selection and Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19896)
*Filipe Ferreira de Oliveira,Matheus Becali Rocha,Renato A. Krohling*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 使用SHAP特征选择方法提升膀胱癌诊断模型的透明度和效果，通过XGBoost、LightGBM和CatBoost算法构建六个二分类场景，在保持或提升性能指标的同时优化临床决策支持系统。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提升泌尿系统疾病（特别是膀胱癌）诊断模型的透明度和有效性，开发更可靠、高效的临床决策支持系统以优化筛查和早期诊断。

Method: 采用SHAP特征选择方法，使用XGBoost、LightGBM和CatBoost算法，通过Optuna进行超参数优化，使用SMOTE技术进行类别平衡，构建六个二分类场景来区分膀胱癌与其他泌尿系统和肿瘤疾病。

Result: SHAP特征选择在保持或改善平衡准确率、精确度和特异性等性能指标方面有效，提升了模型的透明度和可解释性。

Conclusion: 基于可解释性技术（SHAP）的特征选择是有效的方法，有助于开发更透明、可靠和高效的临床决策支持系统，优化泌尿系统疾病的筛查和早期诊断。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose an approach to support the diagnosis of urinary
tract diseases, with a focus on bladder cancer, using SHAP (SHapley Additive
exPlanations)-based feature selection to enhance the transparency and
effectiveness of predictive models. Six binary classification scenarios were
developed to distinguish bladder cancer from other urological and oncological
conditions. The algorithms XGBoost, LightGBM, and CatBoost were employed, with
hyperparameter optimization performed using Optuna and class balancing with the
SMOTE technique. The selection of predictive variables was guided by importance
values through SHAP-based feature selection while maintaining or even improving
performance metrics such as balanced accuracy, precision, and specificity. The
use of explainability techniques (SHAP) for feature selection proved to be an
effective approach. The proposed methodology may contribute to the development
of more transparent, reliable, and efficient clinical decision support systems,
optimizing screening and early diagnosis of urinary tract diseases.

### [8] [FINDER: Feature Inference on Noisy Datasets using Eigenspace Residuals](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19917)
*Trajan Murphy,Akshunna S. Dogra,Hanfeng Gu,Caleb Meredith,Mark Kon,Julio Enrique Castrillion-Candas*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FINDER是一个针对噪声数据集的分类框架，通过随机特征和Kosambi-Karhunen-Loève展开将数据集视为随机场实现，使用特征分解进行噪声数据分类。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 处理低信噪比、小样本量、数据收集错误等噪声数据集是分类方法的重要研究前沿，具有理论和实践意义。

Method: 将经验数据集视为底层随机场的实现，映射到适当的希尔伯特空间，通过KLE分解为可计算不可约分量，分析相关算子的谱来识别不同类别的数据区域。

Result: 在阿尔茨海默病分期分类和遥感森林砍伐检测等数据稀缺的科学领域取得了最先进的突破。

Conclusion: 讨论了FINDER优于现有方法的情况、失败模式和其他局限性。

Abstract: ''Noisy'' datasets (regimes with low signal to noise ratios, small sample
sizes, faulty data collection, etc) remain a key research frontier for
classification methods with both theoretical and practical implications. We
introduce FINDER, a rigorous framework for analyzing generic classification
problems, with tailored algorithms for noisy datasets. FINDER incorporates
fundamental stochastic analysis ideas into the feature learning and inference
stages to optimally account for the randomness inherent to all empirical
datasets. We construct ''stochastic features'' by first viewing empirical
datasets as realizations from an underlying random field (without assumptions
on its exact distribution) and then mapping them to appropriate Hilbert spaces.
The Kosambi-Karhunen-Lo\'eve expansion (KLE) breaks these stochastic features
into computable irreducible components, which allow classification over noisy
datasets via an eigen-decomposition: data from different classes resides in
distinct regions, identified by analyzing the spectrum of the associated
operators. We validate FINDER on several challenging, data-deficient scientific
domains, producing state of the art breakthroughs in: (i) Alzheimer's Disease
stage classification, (ii) Remote sensing detection of deforestation. We end
with a discussion on when FINDER is expected to outperform existing methods,
its failure modes, and other limitations.

### [9] [Beyond the Ideal: Analyzing the Inexact Muon Update](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19933)
*Egor Shulgin,Sultan AlRashed,Francesco Orabona,Peter Richtárik*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文首次分析了Muon优化器中近似正交化更新的理论性能，揭示了近似误差与最优步长和动量参数之间的耦合关系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Muon优化器在实践中依赖快速近似正交化，但现有理论分析都假设使用计算不可行的精确SVD更新，存在理论与实践的脱节。

Method: 在线性最小化预言机框架下引入加性误差模型来分析近似正交化更新，量化性能下降与LMO不精确度的关系。

Result: 分析表明：较低的正交化精度需要较小的步长但较大的动量参数，近似精度成为必须与学习率协同调优的关键参数。NanoGPT实验证实了这一耦合关系。

Conclusion: 将近似正交化过程从实现细节提升为关键调优参数，必须与学习率调度协同优化，填补了Muon优化器理论与实践的差距。

Abstract: The Muon optimizer has rapidly emerged as a powerful, geometry-aware
alternative to AdamW, demonstrating strong performance in large-scale training
of neural networks. However, a critical theory-practice disconnect exists:
Muon's efficiency relies on fast, approximate orthogonalization, yet all prior
theoretical work analyzes an idealized, computationally intractable version
assuming exact SVD-based updates. This work moves beyond the ideal by providing
the first analysis of the inexact orthogonalized update at Muon's core. We
develop our analysis within the general framework of Linear Minimization Oracle
(LMO)-based optimization, introducing a realistic additive error model to
capture the inexactness of practical approximation schemes. Our analysis yields
explicit bounds that quantify performance degradation as a function of the LMO
inexactness/error. We reveal a fundamental coupling between this inexactness
and the optimal step size and momentum: lower oracle precision requires a
smaller step size but larger momentum parameter. These findings elevate the
approximation procedure (e.g., the number of Newton-Schulz steps) from an
implementation detail to a critical parameter that must be co-tuned with the
learning schedule. NanoGPT experiments directly confirm the predicted coupling,
with optimal learning rates clearly shifting as approximation precision
changes.

### [10] [Mitigating Privacy-Utility Trade-off in Decentralized Federated Learning via $f$-Differential Privacy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19934)
*Xiang Li,Buxin Su,Chendi Wang,Qi Long,Weijie J. Su*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文针对去中心化联邦学习中的隐私预算量化挑战，提出了两种基于f-DP的隐私核算方法：PN-f-DP和Sec-f-LDP，能够更准确地捕捉稀疏通信、本地迭代和相关噪声带来的隐私放大效应。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 去中心化联邦学习中的隐私预算量化具有挑战性，因为存在复杂的算法组件如去中心化通信和本地更新，现有方法难以准确核算隐私泄露。

Method: 开发了两种新的f-DP核算方法：PN-f-DP量化随机游走通信下用户对之间的隐私泄露，Sec-f-LDP通过共享秘密支持结构化噪声注入。结合f-DP理论和马尔可夫链集中工具来捕捉隐私放大效应。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上的实验表明，与基于Rényi DP的方法相比，本文方法产生更紧的(ε,δ)边界和更好的效用。

Conclusion: f-DP在去中心化隐私核算中具有优势，能够提供更准确的隐私保护保证。

Abstract: Differentially private (DP) decentralized Federated Learning (FL) allows
local users to collaborate without sharing their data with a central server.
However, accurately quantifying the privacy budget of private FL algorithms is
challenging due to the co-existence of complex algorithmic components such as
decentralized communication and local updates. This paper addresses privacy
accounting for two decentralized FL algorithms within the $f$-differential
privacy ($f$-DP) framework. We develop two new $f$-DP-based accounting methods
tailored to decentralized settings: Pairwise Network $f$-DP (PN-$f$-DP), which
quantifies privacy leakage between user pairs under random-walk communication,
and Secret-based $f$-Local DP (Sec-$f$-LDP), which supports structured noise
injection via shared secrets. By combining tools from $f$-DP theory and Markov
chain concentration, our accounting framework captures privacy amplification
arising from sparse communication, local iterations, and correlated noise.
Experiments on synthetic and real datasets demonstrate that our methods yield
consistently tighter $(\epsilon,\delta)$ bounds and improved utility compared
to R\'enyi DP-based approaches, illustrating the benefits of $f$-DP in
decentralized privacy accounting.

### [11] [Are Greedy Task Orderings Better Than Random in Continual Linear Regression?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19941)
*Matan Tsipory,Ran Levinstein,Itay Evron,Mark Kong,Deanna Needell,Daniel Soudry*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文分析了持续学习中任务排序对线性回归性能的影响，重点研究了贪婪最大化任务间差异性的排序策略，并与随机排序进行了对比。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机在于探索持续学习中任务排序策略对学习性能的影响，特别是贪婪最大化任务间差异性的排序方法，这在先前研究中尚未深入探讨。

Method: 使用Kaczmarz方法工具，形式化贪婪排序策略，并开发几何和代数直觉。在线性回归和CIFAR-100分类任务上进行实证分析，同时进行理论分析证明收敛率边界。

Result: 实证显示贪婪排序在平均损失上比随机排序收敛更快。理论分析表明：在高秩回归设置下，贪婪排序与随机排序有相似的损失边界；但在一般秩设置下，允许重复的贪婪排序收敛率为O(1/∛k)，而单次贪婪排序可能失败。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了贪婪排序和随机排序之间的细微差别，贪婪排序在允许重复时表现更好，但单次贪婪排序可能失败，为持续学习中的任务排序策略提供了重要见解。

Abstract: We analyze task orderings in continual learning for linear regression,
assuming joint realizability of training data. We focus on orderings that
greedily maximize dissimilarity between consecutive tasks, a concept briefly
explored in prior work but still surrounded by open questions. Using tools from
the Kaczmarz method literature, we formalize such orderings and develop
geometric and algebraic intuitions around them. Empirically, we demonstrate
that greedy orderings converge faster than random ones in terms of the average
loss across tasks, both for linear regression with random data and for linear
probing on CIFAR-100 classification tasks. Analytically, in a high-rank
regression setting, we prove a loss bound for greedy orderings analogous to
that of random ones. However, under general rank, we establish a
repetition-dependent separation. Specifically, while prior work showed that for
random orderings, with or without replacement, the average loss after $k$
iterations is bounded by $\mathcal{O}(1/\sqrt{k})$, we prove that single-pass
greedy orderings may fail catastrophically, whereas those allowing repetition
converge at rate $\mathcal{O}(1/\sqrt[3]{k})$. Overall, we reveal nuances
within and between greedy and random orderings.

*Shaocong Ma,Heng Huang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出一种椭圆不确定性集合来处理金融市场中RL代理训练与部署环境不匹配的问题，解决传统鲁棒RL方法无法捕捉市场冲击方向性的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 金融应用中，RL代理在历史数据上训练时不会影响价格，但实际部署时交易行为会产生市场冲击，这种环境不匹配会显著降低性能。传统鲁棒RL方法依赖对称结构，无法捕捉市场冲击的方向性特征。

Method: 开发了一类新颖的椭圆不确定性集合，建立了最坏情况不确定性的隐式和显式闭式解，实现了高效可处理的鲁棒策略评估。

Result: 在单资产和多资产交易任务上的实验表明，该方法获得了更优的夏普比率，并在交易量增加时保持鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该方法为金融市场中的RL提供了更忠实和可扩展的解决方案，能够有效处理市场冲击带来的环境不匹配问题。

Abstract: In financial applications, reinforcement learning (RL) agents are commonly
trained on historical data, where their actions do not influence prices.
However, during deployment, these agents trade in live markets where their own
transactions can shift asset prices, a phenomenon known as market impact. This
mismatch between training and deployment environments can significantly degrade
performance. Traditional robust RL approaches address this model
misspecification by optimizing the worst-case performance over a set of
uncertainties, but typically rely on symmetric structures that fail to capture
the directional nature of market impact. To address this issue, we develop a
novel class of elliptic uncertainty sets. We establish both implicit and
explicit closed-form solutions for the worst-case uncertainty under these sets,
enabling efficient and tractable robust policy evaluation. Experiments on
single-asset and multi-asset trading tasks demonstrate that our method achieves
superior Sharpe ratio and remains robust under increasing trade volumes,
offering a more faithful and scalable approach to RL in financial markets.

### [13] [On the Optimal Construction of Unbiased Gradient Estimators for Zeroth-Order Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19953)
*Shaocong Ma,Heng Huang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的无偏零阶梯度估计器，通过将方向导数重新表述为伸缩级数并采样精心设计的分布，消除传统零阶优化中的偏差问题，在保持有利方差的同时实现无偏估计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有零阶优化方法存在梯度估计器偏差问题，除非扰动步长趋近于零，这种偏差限制了优化性能。

Method: 通过重新表述方向导数为伸缩级数，采样精心设计的分布来构造无偏梯度估计器，分析了四种具体构造的理论性质，推导了最优缩放分布和扰动步长。

Result: 理论证明使用该估计器的SGD在平滑非凸目标上达到最优复杂度，在合成任务和语言模型微调实验中表现出比标准方法更优的精度和收敛性。

Conclusion: 提出的无偏梯度估计器家族成功解决了零阶优化中的偏差问题，在理论和实验上都表现出优越性能。

Abstract: Zeroth-order optimization (ZOO) is an important framework for stochastic
optimization when gradients are unavailable or expensive to compute. A
potential limitation of existing ZOO methods is the bias inherent in most
gradient estimators unless the perturbation stepsize vanishes. In this paper,
we overcome this biasedness issue by proposing a novel family of unbiased
gradient estimators based solely on function evaluations. By reformulating
directional derivatives as a telescoping series and sampling from carefully
designed distributions, we construct estimators that eliminate bias while
maintaining favorable variance. We analyze their theoretical properties, derive
optimal scaling distributions and perturbation stepsizes of four specific
constructions, and prove that SGD using the proposed estimators achieves
optimal complexity for smooth non-convex objectives. Experiments on synthetic
tasks and language model fine-tuning confirm the superior accuracy and
convergence of our approach compared to standard methods.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文研究了两点零阶梯度估计器，发现当扰动步长趋近于零时，最小化估计器渐近方差的扰动分布可以与真实梯度方向对齐，而非固定长度。提出了方向对齐扰动(DAP)方案，在理论和实证上均优于传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注固定长度的随机扰动，但忽略了扰动方向与梯度方向对齐可能带来的优势。本文旨在探索这种方向对齐扰动在零阶优化中的潜力。

Method: 将问题建模为扰动分布空间上的约束函数优化问题，提出了方向对齐扰动(DAP)方案，该方案能够自适应地在关键方向上提供更高精度。

Result: 理论分析表明DAP方案优于传统方法，实证评估在合成问题和实际任务中都验证了DAP在特定条件下的优越性能。

Conclusion: 方向对齐扰动方案为零阶优化提供了新的思路，扩展了现有复杂度界限到更广泛的扰动类型，在实际应用中具有显著优势。

Abstract: In this paper, we explore the two-point zeroth-order gradient estimator and
identify the distribution of random perturbations that minimizes the
estimator's asymptotic variance as the perturbation stepsize tends to zero. We
formulate it as a constrained functional optimization problem over the space of
perturbation distributions. Our findings reveal that such desired perturbations
can align directionally with the true gradient, instead of maintaining a fixed
length. While existing research has largely focused on fixed-length
perturbations, the potential advantages of directional alignment have been
overlooked. To address this gap, we delve into the theoretical and empirical
properties of the directionally aligned perturbation (DAP) scheme, which
adaptively offers higher accuracy along critical directions. Additionally, we
provide a convergence analysis for stochastic gradient descent using
$\delta$-unbiased random perturbations, extending existing complexity bounds to
a wider range of perturbations. Through empirical evaluations on both synthetic
problems and practical tasks, we demonstrate that DAPs outperform traditional
methods under specific conditions.

*Hanbin Hong,Ashish Kundu,Ali Payani,Binghui Wang,Yuan Hong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: UCAN提出了一种使用各向异性噪声的通用认证对抗鲁棒性方法，显著提升了现有随机平滑方法的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有随机平滑方法主要使用各向同性噪声分布，忽略了输入和数据维度的异质性，限制了鲁棒性认证的效果。

Method: 通过将现有随机平滑方法从对称（各向同性）噪声分布转换为非对称（各向异性）噪声分布，并提供三种噪声参数生成器来优化不同数据维度的噪声参数。

Result: 在MNIST、CIFAR10和ImageNet数据集上，UCAN在大认证半径下的认证准确率相比现有最先进方法提升了高达182.6%。

Conclusion: UCAN通过引入各向异性噪声，为随机平滑方法提供了更有效的对抗鲁棒性认证框架。

Abstract: Randomized smoothing has become essential for achieving certified adversarial
robustness in machine learning models. However, current methods primarily use
isotropic noise distributions that are uniform across all data dimensions, such
as image pixels, limiting the effectiveness of robustness certification by
ignoring the heterogeneity of inputs and data dimensions. To address this
limitation, we propose UCAN: a novel technique that \underline{U}niversally
\underline{C}ertifies adversarial robustness with \underline{A}nisotropic
\underline{N}oise. UCAN is designed to enhance any existing randomized
smoothing method, transforming it from symmetric (isotropic) to asymmetric
(anisotropic) noise distributions, thereby offering a more tailored defense
against adversarial attacks. Our theoretical framework is versatile, supporting
a wide array of noise distributions for certified robustness in different
$\ell_p$-norms and applicable to any arbitrary classifier by guaranteeing the
classifier's prediction over perturbed inputs with provable robustness bounds
through tailored noise injection. Additionally, we develop a novel framework
equipped with three exemplary noise parameter generators (NPGs) to optimally
fine-tune the anisotropic noise parameters for different data dimensions,
allowing for pursuing different levels of robustness enhancements in
practice.Empirical evaluations underscore the significant leap in UCAN's
performance over existing state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating up to
$182.6\%$ improvement in certified accuracy at large certified radii on MNIST,
CIFAR10, and ImageNet datasets.\footnote{Code is anonymously available at

*Renzhao Liang,Sizhe Xu,Chenggang Xie,Jingru Chen,Feiyang Ren,Shu Yang,Takahiro Yabe*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文挑战了时间序列预测中的"长序列信息增益假设"，发现适当截断历史数据反而能提高预测精度，提出AMRC方法通过动态掩码损失和表示一致性约束来抑制冗余特征学习。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统时间序列预测中普遍认为长序列包含更多有用信息，但研究发现现有模型在训练时会学习大量冗余特征（如噪声或不相关波动），反而影响有效信号提取。

Method: 提出自适应掩码损失与表示一致性（AMRC）方法：1）动态掩码损失自适应识别高区分度时间片段指导梯度下降；2）表示一致性约束稳定输入、标签和预测之间的映射关系。

Result: 实验结果表明AMRC能有效抑制冗余特征学习，显著提升模型性能。

Conclusion: 这项工作不仅挑战了时间建模中的传统假设，还为开发高效鲁棒的预测模型提供了新的理论见解和方法突破。

Abstract: Time series forecasting plays a pivotal role in critical domains such as
energy management and financial markets. Although deep learning-based
approaches (e.g., MLP, RNN, Transformer) have achieved remarkable progress, the
prevailing "long-sequence information gain hypothesis" exhibits inherent
limitations. Through systematic experimentation, this study reveals a
counterintuitive phenomenon: appropriately truncating historical data can
paradoxically enhance prediction accuracy, indicating that existing models
learn substantial redundant features (e.g., noise or irrelevant fluctuations)
during training, thereby compromising effective signal extraction. Building
upon information bottleneck theory, we propose an innovative solution termed
Adaptive Masking Loss with Representation Consistency (AMRC), which features
two core components: 1) Dynamic masking loss, which adaptively identified
highly discriminative temporal segments to guide gradient descent during model
training; 2) Representation consistency constraint, which stabilized the
mapping relationships among inputs, labels, and predictions. Experimental
results demonstrate that AMRC effectively suppresses redundant feature learning
while significantly improving model performance. This work not only challenges
conventional assumptions in temporal modeling but also provides novel
theoretical insights and methodological breakthroughs for developing efficient
and robust forecasting models.

TL;DR: MDLMs在数学和编程任务中，任意顺序解码与左到右解码性能相当，多令牌解码会降低性能。但MDLMs的推理即填充方法能结构化输出、测量答案不确定性，并提供高质量后训练数据。多令牌熵解码能保持性能并减少2.7倍步骤。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨MDLMs相比传统左到右解码模型的优势，特别是在数学和编程任务中，如何利用MDLMs的推理即填充和多令牌解码能力来提升性能。

Method: 提出推理即填充方法，使用MDLMs填充推理模板来结构化输出；提出多令牌熵解码(MED)，基于条件熵的自适应并行解码器。

Result: 在GSM8k上，使用后验推理轨迹微调LLaDA-8B Base获得与人工编写推理轨迹相当的提升；MED保持性能同时减少2.7倍解码步骤。

Conclusion: MDLMs的训练和计算为推理和后训练方法开辟了新途径，推理即填充和MED展示了MDLMs在结构化推理和高效解码方面的潜力。

Abstract: Masked diffusion language models (MDLMs) are trained to in-fill positions in
randomly masked sequences, in contrast to next-token prediction models.
Discussions around MDLMs focus on two benefits: (1) any-order decoding and 2)
multi-token decoding. However, we observe that for math and coding tasks,
any-order algorithms often underperform or behave similarly to left-to-right
sampling, and standard multi-token decoding significantly degrades performance.
At inference time, MDLMs compute the conditional distribution of all masked
positions. A natural question is: How can we justify this additional compute
when left-to-right one-token-at-a-time decoding is on par with any-order
decoding algorithms? First, we propose reasoning-as-infilling. By using MDLMs
to infill a reasoning template, we can structure outputs and distinguish
between reasoning and answer tokens. In turn, this enables measuring answer
uncertainty during reasoning, and early exits when the model converges on an
answer. Next, given an answer, reasoning-as-infilling enables sampling from the
MDLM posterior over reasoning traces conditioned on the answer, providing a new
source of high-quality data for post-training. On GSM8k, we observe that
fine-tuning LLaDA-8B Base on its posterior reasoning traces provides a
performance boost on par with fine-tuning on human-written reasoning traces.
Additionally, given an answer, reasoning-as-infilling provides a method for
scoring the correctness of the reasoning process at intermediate steps. Second,
we propose multi-token entropy decoding (MED), a simple adaptive sampler that
minimizes the error incurred by decoding positions in parallel based on the
conditional entropies of those positions. MED preserves performance across
benchmarks and leads to 2.7x fewer steps. Our work demonstrates that the
training and compute used by MDLMs unlock many new inference and post-training
methods.

TL;DR: 使用RSSI数据和决策树分类在CAD建模的平面图中进行RFID位置推断，在12个实验室区域分类中达到34.2%准确率，可用于国防物资的异常检测和错放监控。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决RFID跟踪在国防资产存储中的安全性问题，包括长距离检测、欺骗和伪造等漏洞导致的错误检测和操作安全事件。

Method: 使用监督学习模拟，结合真实的RSSI数据和决策树分类，在CAD建模的平面图中进行12个实验室区域的分类，采用分层子采样和类别权重处理类别不平衡问题。

Result: 模型在5000个平衡观测值上训练，总体准确率为34.2%，多个区域（F、G、H等）的F1分数超过0.40，但稀有类别（特别是LabZoneC）经常被错误分类。

Conclusion: 基于RSSI的决策树可以在实际模拟中应用于区域级异常检测或错放监控，通过更好的天线布局或额外传感器和多模态传感器融合可以改善低覆盖和低信号区域的分类性能。

Abstract: Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) tracking may be a viable solution for
defense assets that must be stored in accordance with security guidelines.
However, poor sensor specificity (vulnerabilities include long range detection,
spoofing, and counterfeiting) can lead to erroneous detection and operational
security events. We present a supervised learning simulation with realistic
Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) data and Decision Tree classification
in a Computer Assisted Design (CAD)-modeled floor plan that encapsulates some
of the challenges encountered in defense storage. In this work, we focused on
classifying 12 lab zones (LabZoneA-L) to perform location inference. The raw
dataset had approximately 980,000 reads. Class frequencies were imbalanced, and
class weights were calculated to account for class imbalance in this
multi-class setting. The model, trained on stratified subsamples to 5,000
balanced observations, yielded an overall accuracy of 34.2% and F1-scores
greater than 0.40 for multiple zones (Zones F, G, H, etc.). However, rare
classes (most notably LabZoneC) were often misclassified, even with the use of
class weights. An adjacency-aware confusion matrix was calculated to allow
better interpretation of physically adjacent zones. These results suggest that
RSSI-based decision trees can be applied in realistic simulations to enable
zone-level anomaly detection or misplacement monitoring for defense supply
logistics. Reliable classification performance in low-coverage and low-signal
zones could be improved with better antenna placement or additional sensors and
sensor fusion with other modalities.

TL;DR: SALT是一个轻量级框架，通过构建轨迹图来提供更细粒度的优势分配，解决了基于群体的RL算法在复杂多步任务中因稀疏奖励导致的训练不稳定问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在单轮任务中表现出色，但在复杂多步任务中面临挑战。基于群体的RL算法（如GRPO）仅依赖稀疏结果奖励，导致训练不稳定和次优策略，因为有益和有害动作在多步交互中纠缠在一起。

Method: 提出SALT框架，通过从相同提示的轨迹构建图来量化每个步骤的质量并相应分配优势。该框架作为即插即用模块，无需修改rollout过程，计算开销极小。

Result: 在WebShop、ALFWorld和AppWorld基准测试中，SALT在不同模型大小下均能持续提升性能。

Conclusion: SALT有效解决了基于群体的RL算法中的奖励分配问题，为复杂多步任务提供了稳定高效的训练方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities,
enabling language agents to excel at single-turn tasks. However, their
application to complex, multi-step, and long-horizon tasks remains challenging.
While reinforcement learning (RL) offers a promising avenue for addressing
these challenges, mainstream approaches typically rely solely on sparse,
outcome-based rewards, a limitation that becomes especially problematic for
group-based RL algorithms lacking critic models, such as Group Relative Policy
Optimization (GRPO). In such methods, uniformly rewarding or penalizing all
actions within a trajectory can lead to training instability and suboptimal
policies, because beneficial and detrimental actions are often entangled across
multi-step interactions. To address this challenge, we propose SALT, a novel
and lightweight framework that provides a finer-grained advantage assignment,
derived solely from outcome rewards. We achieve this by constructing a graph
from trajectories of the same prompt, which allows us to quantify the quality
of each step and assign advantages accordingly. Crucially, SALT is designed as
a plug-and-play module that seamlessly integrates with existing group-based RL
algorithms, requiring no modifications to the rollout procedure and introducing
negligible computational overhead. Extensive experiments on the WebShop,
ALFWorld, and AppWorld benchmarks with various model sizes demonstrate that
SALT consistently improves performance. We also conduct a thorough analysis to
validate the design choices behind SALT and offer actionable insights.

Conclusion: 该综合数据集和工具包推动机器学习在异常检测、地址分类、市场分析和大规模图机器学习基准测试等应用中的进展。

Abstract: Since its 2009 genesis block, the Bitcoin network has processed \num{>1.08}
billion (B) transactions representing \num{>8.72}B BTC, offering rich potential
for machine learning (ML); yet, its pseudonymity and obscured flow of funds
inherent in its \utxo-based design, have rendered this data largely

funds. This temporal, heterogeneous graph encompasses complete transaction
history up to block \cutoffHeight, consisting of \num{>2.4}B nodes and
\num{>39.72}B edges. Additionally, we provide custom sampling methods yielding
node and edge feature vectors of sampled communities, tools to load and analyze
the Bitcoin graph data within specialized graph databases, and ready-to-use
database snapshots. This comprehensive dataset and toolkit empower the ML
community to tackle Bitcoin's intricate ecosystem at scale, driving progress in

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统时序点过程采用自回归模型，采样过程必须顺序执行，效率受限，无法满足大规模应用需求

Result: 在真实数据集上实现了经验性加速，理论上有保证

Conclusion: 该方法在保持表达能力的同时实现了高效并行生成，为大规模TPP应用架起了桥梁

Abstract: Temporal point processes are powerful generative models for event sequences
that capture complex dependencies in time-series data. They are commonly
specified using autoregressive models that learn the distribution of the next
event from the previous events. This makes sampling inherently sequential,
limiting efficiency. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm based on
rejection sampling that enables exact sampling of multiple future values from
existing TPP models, in parallel, and without requiring any architectural
changes or retraining. Besides theoretical guarantees, our method demonstrates
empirical speedups on real-world datasets, bridging the gap between expressive
modeling and efficient parallel generation for large-scale TPP applications.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于上下文马尔可夫决策过程的在线广告竞价策略，通过两阶段最大似然估计和强化学习算法，解决了广告效果的延迟性、累积性和用户异质性等问题，实现了接近最优的后悔界。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在线广告平台需要有效的竞价策略来最大化利润，但现有研究往往未能同时考虑广告效果的三个关键因素：延迟和长期效应、累积广告影响（如强化或疲劳效应）以及用户异质性。

Method: 将广告竞价建模为具有延迟泊松奖励的上下文马尔可夫决策过程，提出两阶段最大似然估计器结合数据分割策略，并基于此设计强化学习算法来推导个性化竞价策略。

Result: 该方法实现了$\tilde{O}{(dH^2\sqrt{T})}$的接近最优后悔界，其中$d$是上下文维度，$H$是轮数，$T$是客户数量。理论结果通过仿真实验得到验证。

Conclusion: 所提出的方法能够有效处理广告竞价中的复杂效应，为在线广告平台提供了理论保证的个性化竞价策略解决方案。

Abstract: Online advertising platforms use automated auctions to connect advertisers
with potential customers, requiring effective bidding strategies to maximize
profits. Accurate ad impact estimation requires considering three key factors:
delayed and long-term effects, cumulative ad impacts such as reinforcement or
fatigue, and customer heterogeneity. However, these effects are often not
jointly addressed in previous studies. To capture these factors, we model ad
bidding as a Contextual Markov Decision Process (CMDP) with delayed Poisson
rewards. For efficient estimation, we propose a two-stage maximum likelihood
estimator combined with data-splitting strategies, ensuring controlled
estimation error based on the first-stage estimator's (in)accuracy. Building on
this, we design a reinforcement learning algorithm to derive efficient
personalized bidding strategies. This approach achieves a near-optimal regret
bound of $\tilde{O}{(dH^2\sqrt{T})}$, where $d$ is the contextual dimension,
$H$ is the number of rounds, and $T$ is the number of customers. Our
theoretical findings are validated by simulation experiments.

Conclusion: 提出的在线学习算法在计算和延迟开销上大幅降低，特别在需要长推理链的领域表现出色

Abstract: Speculative decoding is widely used in accelerating large language model
(LLM) inference. In this work, we focus on the online draft model selection
problem in speculative decoding. We design an algorithm that provably competes
with the best draft model in hindsight for each query in terms of either the
token acceptance probability or expected acceptance length. In particular, we
show that we can accurately evaluate all draft models, instead of only the
chosen model without incurring additional queries to the target model, which
allows us to improve exponentially over the existing bandit-based approach as
the number of draft models increases. Our approach is generically applicable
with any speculative decoding methods (single draft, multi-drafts and
draft-trees). Moreover, we design system-efficient versions of online learners
and demonstrate that the overhead in computation and latency can be
substantially reduced. We conduct extensive experiments on open-source LLMs and
diverse datasets, demonstrating that our methods substantially outperform the
state-of-the-art EAGLE3 and the BanditSpec baseline in a variety of domains
where specialized domain-expert drafters are available, especially when long
reasoning chains are required.

Motivation: 探索加密资产市场的流动性和波动性特征是否能够预测整体市场风险，为风险管理提供理论依据。

Method: 整合三层统计框架：核心流动性与收益率的交互作用、主成分分析关联、波动性因子投影，并辅以向量自回归、HAR-X模型和防泄漏机器学习协议。

Result: 使用2021-2025年74种资产的1462个日度观测数据，发现跨层的统计显著Granger因果关系和中等样本外预测准确性。

Conclusion: 加密资产的流动性和波动性代理变量能够产生显著的溢出效应，对市场范围风险具有预测能力，为加密市场风险管理提供了实证支持。

Abstract: We study whether liquidity and volatility proxies of a core set of
cryptoassets generate spillovers that forecast market-wide risk. Our empirical
framework integrates three statistical layers: (A) interactions between core
liquidity and returns, (B) principal-component relations linking liquidity and
returns, and (C) volatility-factor projections that capture cross-sectional
volatility crowding. The analysis is complemented by vector autoregression
impulse responses and forecast error variance decompositions (see Granger 1969;
Sims 1980), heterogeneous autoregressive models with exogenous regressors
(HAR-X, Corsi 2009), and a leakage-safe machine learning protocol using
temporal splits, early stopping, validation-only thresholding, and SHAP-based
interpretation. Using daily data from 2021 to 2025 (1462 observations across 74
assets), we document statistically significant Granger-causal relationships
across layers and moderate out-of-sample predictive accuracy. We report the
most informative figures, including the pipeline overview, Layer A heatmap,
Layer C robustness analysis, vector autoregression variance decompositions, and
the test-set precision-recall curve. Full data and figure outputs are provided

Motivation: 现有的对齐或多视图方法忽视时间结构，而动态潜变量模型虽然能捕捉时间依赖但通常限于单脑区、假设线性读出或混淆共享与私有信号。

Method: CTAE使用Transformer编码器和解码器捕捉长程神经动态，并明确将每个区域的潜空间划分为正交的共享和私有子空间。

Result: 在两个高密度电生理数据集上，CTAE提取了有意义的表征，相比现有方法能更好地解码行为变量。

Conclusion: CTAE提供了一个统一框架，既能处理非平稳、非线性动态，又能分离共享与区域特定结构，在多脑区神经记录分析中表现优异。

Abstract: Simultaneous recordings from thousands of neurons across multiple brain areas
reveal rich mixtures of activity that are shared between regions and dynamics
that are unique to each region. Existing alignment or multi-view methods
neglect temporal structure, whereas dynamical latent variable models capture
temporal dependencies but are usually restricted to a single area, assume
linear read-outs, or conflate shared and private signals. We introduce the
Coupled Transformer Autoencoder (CTAE) - a sequence model that addresses both
(i) non-stationary, non-linear dynamics and (ii) separation of shared versus
region-specific structure in a single framework. CTAE employs transformer
encoders and decoders to capture long-range neural dynamics and explicitly
partitions each region's latent space into orthogonal shared and private
subspaces. We demonstrate the effectiveness of CTAE on two high-density
electrophysiology datasets with simultaneous recordings from multiple regions,
one from motor cortical areas and the other from sensory areas. CTAE extracts
meaningful representations that better decode behavioral variables compared to
existing approaches.

TL;DR: ShapeX是一个创新的时间序列分类解释框架，通过识别关键shapelet子序列并使用Shapley值评估其重要性，提供比现有方法更精确和具有因果保真度的解释。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在医疗和金融等高风险应用中，时间序列分类模型的透明度至关重要。现有后验解释方法主要关注时间步级别的特征归因，但忽略了分类结果主要由关键shapelet驱动的先验知识。

Method: ShapeX框架包含Shapelet描述与检测(SDD)框架，能够学习对分类至关重要的多样化shapelet集合，将时间序列分割为有意义的shapelet驱动片段，并使用Shapley值评估其显著性。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上的实验表明，ShapeX在识别最相关子序列方面优于现有方法，提高了时间序列解释的精确度和因果保真度。

Conclusion: ShapeX通过利用shapelet的原子性特性，能够产生揭示因果关系而非仅相关性的解释，为高风险应用中的时间序列分类提供了更可靠的透明度。

Abstract: Explaining time series classification models is crucial, particularly in
high-stakes applications such as healthcare and finance, where transparency and
trust play a critical role. Although numerous time series classification
methods have identified key subsequences, known as shapelets, as core features
for achieving state-of-the-art performance and validating their pivotal role in
classification outcomes, existing post-hoc time series explanation (PHTSE)
methods primarily focus on timestep-level feature attribution. These
explanation methods overlook the fundamental prior that classification outcomes
are predominantly driven by key shapelets. To bridge this gap, we present
ShapeX, an innovative framework that segments time series into meaningful
shapelet-driven segments and employs Shapley values to assess their saliency.
At the core of ShapeX lies the Shapelet Describe-and-Detect (SDD) framework,
which effectively learns a diverse set of shapelets essential for
classification. We further demonstrate that ShapeX produces explanations which
reveal causal relationships instead of just correlations, owing to the
atomicity properties of shapelets. Experimental results on both synthetic and
real-world datasets demonstrate that ShapeX outperforms existing methods in
identifying the most relevant subsequences, enhancing both the precision and
causal fidelity of time series explanations.

Motivation: 社交媒体成为识别自杀风险的重要来源，但自动化检测面临类别不平衡、时间模式复杂性和风险级别序数/分类双重性质的挑战。

Method: 使用3层Transformer编码器建模时间依赖，双预测头（CORAL头和标准分类头），组合损失函数（CORAL+交叉熵+Focal Loss），冻结MentalRoBERTa前6层并采用混合精度训练。

Result: 使用5折分层交叉验证评估，以宏F1分数为主要指标。

Conclusion: 该模型能同时处理自杀风险分类的序数关系和类别不平衡问题，提高检测性能。

Abstract: Social media platforms have become important sources for identifying suicide
risk, but automated detection systems face multiple challenges including severe
class imbalance, temporal complexity in posting patterns, and the dual nature
of risk levels as both ordinal and categorical. This paper proposes a
hierarchical dual-head neural network based on MentalRoBERTa for suicide risk
classification into four levels: indicator, ideation, behavior, and attempt.
The model employs two complementary prediction heads operating on a shared
sequence representation: a CORAL (Consistent Rank Logits) head that preserves
ordinal relationships between risk levels, and a standard classification head
that enables flexible categorical distinctions. A 3-layer Transformer encoder
with 8-head multi-head attention models temporal dependencies across post
sequences, while explicit time interval embeddings capture posting behavior
dynamics. The model is trained with a combined loss function (0.5 CORAL + 0.3
Cross-Entropy + 0.2 Focal Loss) that simultaneously addresses ordinal structure
preservation, overconfidence reduction, and class imbalance. To improve
computational efficiency, we freeze the first 6 layers (50%) of MentalRoBERTa
and employ mixed-precision training. The model is evaluated using 5-fold
stratified cross-validation with macro F1 score as the primary metric.

Conclusion: 建立了同时具有可证明一致性、样本效率和实际可扩展性的RL因果发现算法新类别，标志着经验性能与严格有限样本理论统一的重要进展

Abstract: Causal discovery remains a central challenge in machine learning, yet
existing methods face a fundamental gap: algorithms like GES and GraN-DAG
achieve strong empirical performance but lack finite-sample guarantees, while
theoretically principled approaches fail to scale. We close this gap by
introducing a game-theoretic reinforcement learning framework for causal
discovery, where a DDQN agent directly competes against a strong baseline (GES
or GraN-DAG), always warm-starting from the opponent's solution. This design
yields three provable guarantees: the learned graph is never worse than the
opponent, warm-starting strictly accelerates convergence, and most importantly,
with high probability the algorithm selects the true best candidate graph. To
the best of our knowledge, our result makes a first-of-its-kind progress in
explaining such finite-sample guarantees in causal discovery: on synthetic SEMs
(30 nodes), the observed error probability decays with n, tightly matching
theory. On real-world benchmarks including Sachs, Asia, Alarm, Child, Hepar2,
Dream, and Andes, our method consistently improves upon GES and GraN-DAG while
remaining theoretically safe. Remarkably, it scales to large graphs such as
Hepar2 (70 nodes), Dream (100 nodes), and Andes (220 nodes). Together, these
results establish a new class of RL-based causal discovery algorithms that are
simultaneously provably consistent, sample-efficient, and practically scalable,
marking a decisive step toward unifying empirical performance with rigorous
finite-sample theory.

*Ayatullah Faruk Mollah*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的维度加权方案，并将其整合到KNN分类器中，通过加权Minkowski距离改进了传统KNN在模式分类中的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在多维样本的模式分类中，基于加权维度的距离度量至关重要，但常用的欧氏距离存在诸多问题，需要更有效的距离度量方法。

Method: 开发了新颖的维度加权方案，将其整合到KNN分类器中，使用加权Minkowski距离来调节包含k个参考样本区域的大小和形状。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上表现良好，特别是在基因表达数据集上，分类准确率显著提升约10%，在不同k值的交叉验证实验中表现一致。

Conclusion: 该方法是对传统KNN分类器的重要推广，通过提出的加权方案和适当范数，在高维小样本数据集中实现了更有意义的最近邻选择。

Abstract: Studies on various facets of pattern classification is often imperative while
working with multi-dimensional samples pertaining to diverse application
scenarios. In this notion, weighted dimension-based distance measure has been
one of the vital considerations in pattern analysis as it reflects the degree
of similarity between samples. Though it is often presumed to be settled with
the pervasive use of Euclidean distance, plethora of issues often surface. In
this paper, we present (a) a detail analysis on the impact of distance measure
norms and weights of dimensions along with visualization, (b) a novel weighting
scheme for each dimension, (c) incorporation of this dimensional weighting
schema into a KNN classifier, and (d) pattern classification on a variety of
synthetic as well as realistic datasets with the developed model. It has
performed well across diverse experiments in comparison to the traditional KNN
under the same experimental setups. Specifically, for gene expression datasets,
it yields significant and consistent gain in classification accuracy (around
10%) in all cross-validation experiments with different values of k. As such
datasets contain limited number of samples of high dimensions, meaningful
selection of nearest neighbours is desirable, and this requirement is
reasonably met by regulating the shape and size of the region enclosing the k
number of reference samples with the developed weighting schema and appropriate
norm. It, therefore, stands as an important generalization of KNN classifier
powered by weighted Minkowski distance with the present weighting schema.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出一种完全解耦的训练策略，通过将原型建模为高斯混合模型并使用在线EM风格更新，独立于编码器损失，解决了自监督学习中原型崩溃的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 原型自监督学习方法普遍存在部分原型崩溃问题，多个原型收敛到几乎相同的表示，这削弱了提供多样化和信息丰富目标的核心目的，导致实践者过度参数化原型集或添加临时正则化器。

Method: 引入完全解耦的训练策略，将原型和编码器在不同目标下学习。具体将原型建模为高斯混合模型，使用在线EM风格过程更新，独立于编码器的损失。

Result: 这种简单而原则性的解耦消除了原型崩溃，无需显式正则化，产生持续多样化的原型和更强的下游性能。

Conclusion: 通过打破原型和编码器的联合优化，解决了原型崩溃的根本原因，提供了一种更有效的自监督学习方法。

Abstract: Prototypical self-supervised learning methods consistently suffer from
partial prototype collapse, where multiple prototypes converge to nearly
identical representations. This undermines their central purpose -- providing
diverse and informative targets to guide encoders toward rich representations
-- and has led practitioners to over-parameterize prototype sets or add ad-hoc
regularizers, which mitigate symptoms rather than address the root cause. We
empirically trace the collapse to the joint optimization of encoders and
prototypes, which encourages a type of shortcut learning: early in training
prototypes drift toward redundant representations that minimize loss without
necessarily enhancing representation diversity. To break the joint
optimization, we introduce a fully decoupled training strategy that learns
prototypes and encoders under separate objectives. Concretely, we model
prototypes as a Gaussian mixture updated with an online EM-style procedure,
independent of the encoder's loss. This simple yet principled decoupling
eliminates prototype collapse without explicit regularization and yields
consistently diverse prototypes and stronger downstream performance.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 当前时间序列基础模型表现不佳，原因在于简单套用NLP/CV范式，而时间序列数据缺乏语义概念覆盖。建议转向基于不变性原则的系统化数据集构建。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 时间序列基础模型表现不如轻量监督基线和经典模型，这是因为直接套用了NLP/CV的数据收集范式，但时间序列数据缺乏语义概念密度。

Method: 提出从机会主义数据聚合转向原则性设计：构建系统覆盖时间语义不变性空间的数据集，基于第一原则建立时间序列不变性本体论。

Result: 分析表明当前时间序列基础模型面临根本性挑战，需要重新思考数据构建范式。

Conclusion: 只有通过不变性覆盖确保表征完整性，时间序列基础模型才能实现泛化、推理和真正涌现行为所需的对齐结构。

Abstract: Timeseries foundation models (TSFMs) have multiplied, yet lightweight
supervised baselines and even classical models often match them. We argue this
gap stems from the naive importation of NLP or CV pipelines. In language and
vision, large web-scale corpora densely capture human concepts i.e. there are
countless images and text of apples. In contrast, timeseries data is built to
complement the image and text modalities. There are no timeseries dataset that
contains the concept apple. As a result, the scrape-everything-online paradigm
fails for TS. We posit that progress demands a shift from opportunistic
aggregation to principled design: constructing datasets that systematically
span the space of invariance that preserve temporal semantics. To this end, we
suggest that the ontology of timeseries invariances should be built based on
first principles. Only by ensuring representational completeness through
invariance coverage can TSFMs achieve the aligned structure necessary for
generalisation, reasoning, and truly emergent behaviour.

*Tingting Dan,Xinwei Huang,Jiaqi Ding,Yinggang Zheng,Guorong Wu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该研究通过多层图扩散模型发现，阿尔茨海默病中tau蛋白的传播受到结构连接和功能连接的不对称影响，FC主导皮层下区域传播，SC主导枕叶、顶叶和边缘系统传播，且这种主导地位随疾病阶段变化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 病理tau蛋白沿着特定脑网络积累，表明大规模网络架构在阿尔茨海默病进展中起关键作用，但结构连接和功能连接如何相互作用影响tau传播尚不清楚。

Method: 利用大量纵向神经影像数据，通过多层图扩散模型研究SC-FC相互作用对tau传播的影响。

Result: 发现SC和FC对tau传播的区域性不对称贡献：FC主导皮层下区域、岛叶、额叶和颞叶皮层传播，SC主导枕叶、顶叶和边缘区域传播。这种主导地位随疾病阶段变化，早期AD以FC为主，晚期以SC为主。

Conclusion: 结构连接和功能连接在tau传播中发挥不对称作用，这种模式与AD相关基因表达区域高度一致，非可改变风险因素和生物机制通过改变解剖和功能通路的主导路径来重塑tau传播。

Abstract: Emerging neuroimaging evidence shows that pathological tau proteins build up
along specific brain networks, suggesting that large-scale network architecture
plays a key role in the progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, how
structural connectivity (SC) and functional connectivity (FC) interact to
influence tau propagation remains unclear. Leveraging an unprecedented volume
of longitudinal neuroimaging data, we examine SC-FC interactions through a
multi-layer graph diffusion model. Beyond showing that connectome architecture
constrains tau spread, our model reveals a regionally asymmetric contribution
of SC and FC. Specifically, FC predominantly drives tau spread in subcortical
areas, the insula, frontal and temporal cortices, whereas SC plays a larger
role in occipital, parietal, and limbic regions. The relative dominance of SC
versus FC shifts over the course of disease, with FC generally prevailing in
early AD and SC becoming primary in later stages. Spatial patterns of SC- and
FC-dominant regions strongly align with the regional expression of
AD-associated genes involved in inflammation, apoptosis, and lysosomal
function, including CHUK (IKK-alpha), TMEM106B, MCL1, NOTCH1, and TH. In
parallel, other non-modifiable risk factors (e.g., APOE genotype, sex) and
biological mechanisms (e.g., amyloid deposition) selectively reshape tau
propagation by shifting dominant routes between anatomical and functional
pathways in a region-specific manner. Findings are validated in an independent
AD cohort.

TL;DR: 提出HyperNS方法解决大规模TSP问题，通过聚类和超导览策略减少搜索空间，在大型实例上优于现有神经方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有神经方法在大规模TSP实例中面临内存限制、初始解质量不高和全局引导不足等挑战。

Method: 采用"先聚类后路由"策略，使用稀疏热图图进行聚类，生成超导览来指导初始化和优化过程。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上的实验表明，该方法优于现有神经方法，特别是在处理大规模实例时显著缩小了与最优解的差距。

Conclusion: HyperNS方法通过超导览引导的邻域搜索有效解决了大规模TSP问题，提供了更高效的优化方案。

Abstract: Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) is a classic NP-hard problem that has
garnered significant attention from both academia and industry. While
neural-based methods have shown promise for solving TSPs, they still face
challenges in scaling to larger instances, particularly in memory constraints
associated with global heatmaps, edge weights, or access matrices, as well as
in generating high-quality initial solutions and insufficient global guidance
for efficiently navigating vast search spaces. To address these challenges, we
propose a Hyper Tour Guided Neighborhood Search (HyperNS) method for
large-scale TSP instances. Inspired by the ``clustering first, route second"
strategy, our approach initially divides the TSP instance into clusters using a
sparse heatmap graph and abstracts them as supernodes, followed by the
generation of a hyper tour to guide both the initialization and optimization
processes. This method reduces the search space by focusing on edges relevant
to the hyper tour, leading to more efficient and effective optimization.
Experimental results on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that
our approach outperforms existing neural-based methods, particularly in
handling larger-scale instances, offering a significant reduction in the gap to
the optimal solution.

TL;DR: 提出了RLEV方法，通过将人类定义的价值信号直接整合到奖励函数中，使LLM优化与可量化的人类价值信号对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然RLVR在客观领域使用二元正确性奖励有效训练模型，但它忽略了并非所有任务都同等重要。需要将人类价值信号直接纳入奖励函数。

Method: RLEV扩展了RLVR框架，在奖励函数中直接整合人类定义的价值信号。使用带有明确真实价值标签的考试风格数据，通过价值加权梯度放大机制实现价值敏感的中止策略。

Result: RLEV在多个RL算法和模型规模上持续优于仅基于正确性的基线。策略不仅提高了价值加权准确率，还学会了价值敏感的中止策略：对低价值提示简洁，对高价值提示详尽。

Conclusion: RLEV在噪声价值信号下保持稳健，表明优化显式效用函数为将LLM与人类优先级对齐提供了实用路径。

Abstract: We propose Reinforcement Learning with Explicit Human Values (RLEV), a method
that aligns Large Language Model (LLM) optimization directly with quantifiable
human value signals. While Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards
(RLVR) effectively trains models in objective domains using binary correctness
rewards, it overlooks that not all tasks are equally significant. RLEV extends
this framework by incorporating human-defined value signals directly into the
reward function. Using exam-style data with explicit ground-truth value labels,
RLEV consistently outperforms correctness-only baselines across multiple RL
algorithms and model scales. Crucially, RLEV policies not only improve
value-weighted accuracy but also learn a value-sensitive termination policy:
concise for low-value prompts, thorough for high-value ones. We demonstrate
this behavior stems from value-weighted gradient amplification on
end-of-sequence tokens. Ablation studies confirm the gain is causally linked to
value alignment. RLEV remains robust under noisy value signals, such as
difficulty-based labels, demonstrating that optimizing for an explicit utility
function offers a practical path to aligning LLMs with human priorities.

Motivation: 传统强化学习的约束优化框架主要关注期望累积奖励，但忽略了奖励分布尾部的风险事件，这在高风险应用中是不够的。

Method: 使用优化确定性等价构建风险感知约束强化学习框架，在参数化强拉格朗日对偶框架下确保与原问题的等价性，并可以包装在标准RL求解器上。

Result: 建立了所提算法的收敛性，并通过数值实验验证了方法的风险感知特性。

Conclusion: 该框架为高风险应用提供了一个有效的风险感知约束强化学习方法，能够处理奖励分布尾部的风险事件。

Abstract: Constrained optimization provides a common framework for dealing with
conflicting objectives in reinforcement learning (RL). In most of these
settings, the objectives (and constraints) are expressed though the expected
accumulated reward. However, this formulation neglects risky or even possibly
catastrophic events at the tails of the reward distribution, and is often
insufficient for high-stakes applications in which the risk involved in
outliers is critical. In this work, we propose a framework for risk-aware
constrained RL, which exhibits per-stage robustness properties jointly in
reward values and time using optimized certainty equivalents (OCEs). Our
framework ensures an exact equivalent to the original constrained problem
within a parameterized strong Lagrangian duality framework under appropriate
constraint qualifications, and yields a simple algorithmic recipe which can be
wrapped around standard RL solvers, such as PPO. Lastly, we establish the
convergence of the proposed algorithm under common assumptions, and verify the
risk-aware properties of our approach through several numerical experiments.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了三种可复制性的松弛定义：点态可复制性、近似可复制性和半可复制性，并在这些弱化定义下实现了样本最优的不可知PAC学习。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于完全可复制性在简单学习任务中也不可行，作者希望探索在何种近似可复制性定义下学习是可能的。

Method: 提出了三种可复制性松弛：(1)点态可复制性：对固定输入保持一致性；(2)近似可复制性：对大部分分布保持一致性；(3)半可复制性：完全可复制但可使用共享无标签样本。

Result: 在常数可复制性参数下，获得了样本最优的不可知PAC学习器：(1)和(2)仅需Θ(d/α²)样本，(3)需要Θ(d²/α²)标注样本。

Conclusion: 通过适当松弛可复制性定义，可以在不显著增加样本复杂度的情况下实现稳定的学习算法。

Abstract: Replicability, introduced by (Impagliazzo et al. STOC '22), is the notion
that algorithms should remain stable under a resampling of their inputs (given
access to shared randomness). While a strong and interesting notion of
stability, the cost of replicability can be prohibitive: there is no replicable
algorithm, for instance, for tasks as simple as threshold learning (Bun et al.
STOC '23). Given such strong impossibility results we ask: under what
approximate notions of replicability is learning possible?
  In this work, we propose three natural relaxations of replicability in the
context of PAC learning: (1) Pointwise: the learner must be consistent on any
fixed input, but not across all inputs simultaneously, (2) Approximate: the
learner must output hypotheses that classify most of the distribution
consistently, (3) Semi: the algorithm is fully replicable, but may additionally
use shared unlabeled samples. In all three cases, for constant replicability
parameters, we obtain sample-optimal agnostic PAC learners: (1) and (2) are
achievable for ``free" using $\Theta(d/\alpha^2)$ samples, while (3) requires
$\Theta(d^2/\alpha^2)$ labeled samples.

TL;DR: 该研究评估了使用金毛猎犬寿命研究队列的常规实验室数据进行癌症风险分类的可行性，发现虽然存在统计学可检测的癌症信号，但由于信号太弱且与正常衰老或其他炎症状况混淆，无法实现可靠的临床分类。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发用于犬类早期癌症检测的无创筛查工具是兽医医学的重要挑战，常规实验室数据作为低成本来源具有潜力，但受到生物标志物非特异性和筛查人群中严重类别不平衡的限制。

Method: 在现实世界约束下，系统比较了126种分析流程，包括不同机器学习模型、特征选择方法和数据平衡技术，使用患者级数据分区防止泄漏，并进行SHAP可解释性分析。

Result: 最优模型（带类别加权的逻辑回归分类器和递归特征消除）显示出中等排序能力（AUROC = 0.815），但临床分类性能差（F1-score = 0.25，阳性预测值 = 0.15），阴性预测值高（0.98）但召回率不足（0.79）。

Conclusion: 常规实验室数据中存在的癌症信号太弱且混淆严重，无法实现可靠的临床鉴别，需要整合多模态数据源才能在计算兽医肿瘤学中取得有意义的进展。

Abstract: The development of accessible screening tools for early cancer detection in
dogs represents a significant challenge in veterinary medicine. Routine
laboratory data offer a promising, low-cost source for such tools, but their
utility is hampered by the non-specificity of individual biomarkers and the
severe class imbalance inherent in screening populations. This study assesses
the feasibility of cancer risk classification using the Golden Retriever
Lifetime Study (GRLS) cohort under real-world constraints, including the
grouping of diverse cancer types and the inclusion of post-diagnosis samples. A
comprehensive benchmark evaluation was conducted, systematically comparing 126
analytical pipelines that comprised various machine learning models, feature
selection methods, and data balancing techniques. Data were partitioned at the
patient level to prevent leakage. The optimal model, a Logistic Regression
classifier with class weighting and recursive feature elimination, demonstrated
moderate ranking ability (AUROC = 0.815; 95% CI: 0.793-0.836) but poor clinical
classification performance (F1-score = 0.25, Positive Predictive Value = 0.15).
While a high Negative Predictive Value (0.98) was achieved, insufficient recall
(0.79) precludes its use as a reliable rule-out test. Interpretability analysis
with SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) revealed that predictions were driven
by non-specific features like age and markers of inflammation and anemia. It is
concluded that while a statistically detectable cancer signal exists in routine
lab data, it is too weak and confounded for clinically reliable discrimination
from normal aging or other inflammatory conditions. This work establishes a
critical performance ceiling for this data modality in isolation and
underscores that meaningful progress in computational veterinary oncology will
require integration of multi-modal data sources.

Motivation: 传统联邦学习在数据异构和稀缺情况下表现不佳，其基于数据量的启发式聚合方法无法准确评估客户端更新的实际效用和可靠性，导致次优个性化和聚合偏差。

Conclusion: CO-PFL有效缓解了聚合偏差，增强了全局协调，通过构建具有稳定更新的定制子模型提升了本地性能。

Abstract: Personalized federated learning (PFL) addresses a critical challenge of
collaboratively training customized models for clients with heterogeneous and
scarce local data. Conventional federated learning, which relies on a single
consensus model, proves inadequate under such data heterogeneity. Its standard
aggregation method of weighting client updates heuristically or by data volume,
operates under an equal-contribution assumption, failing to account for the
actual utility and reliability of each client's update. This often results in
suboptimal personalization and aggregation bias. To overcome these limitations,
we introduce Contribution-Oriented PFL (CO-PFL), a novel algorithm that
dynamically estimates each client's contribution for global aggregation. CO-PFL
performs a joint assessment by analyzing both gradient direction discrepancies
and prediction deviations, leveraging information from gradient and data
subspaces. This dual-subspace analysis provides a principled and discriminative
aggregation weight for each client, emphasizing high-quality updates.
Furthermore, to bolster personalization adaptability and optimization
stability, CO-PFL cohesively integrates a parameter-wise personalization
mechanism with mask-aware momentum optimization. Our approach effectively
mitigates aggregation bias, strengthens global coordination, and enhances local
performance by facilitating the construction of tailored submodels with stable
updates. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets (CIFAR10, CIFAR10C,
CINIC10, and Mini-ImageNet) confirm that CO-PFL consistently surpasses
state-of-the-art methods in in personalization accuracy, robustness,
scalability and convergence stability.

Result: 在LastFM、FacebookNet、Deezer和German等真实网络数据集上测试，计算时间比现有最优算法快两倍，同时能够实现两倍的平衡度。

Conclusion: Fair-SMW算法在保持公平性的同时显著提高了计算效率，为公平聚类提供了更实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent research has focused on mitigating algorithmic bias in clustering by
incorporating fairness constraints into algorithmic design. Notions such as
disparate impact, community cohesion, and cost per population have been
implemented to enforce equitable outcomes. Among these, group fairness
(balance) ensures that each protected group is proportionally represented
within every cluster. However, incorporating balance as a metric of fairness
into spectral clustering algorithms has led to computational times that can be
improved. This study aims to enhance the efficiency of spectral clustering
algorithms by reformulating the constrained optimization problem using a new
formulation derived from the Lagrangian method and the
Sherman-Morrison-Woodbury (SMW) identity, resulting in the Fair-SMW algorithm.
Fair-SMW employs three alternatives to the Laplacian matrix with different
spectral gaps to generate multiple variations of Fair-SMW, achieving clustering
solutions with comparable balance to existing algorithms while offering
improved runtime performance. We present the results of Fair-SMW, evaluated
using the Stochastic Block Model (SBM) to measure both runtime efficiency and
balance across real-world network datasets, including LastFM, FacebookNet,
Deezer, and German. We achieve an improvement in computation time that is twice
as fast as the state-of-the-art, and also flexible enough to achieve twice as
much balance.

pivotal role in capturing inherent data patterns. This paper introduces QKCV

Motivation: 传统联邦学习在非IID数据下存在模型过拟合和局部模型发散的问题，需要一种有效的方法来个性化模型并减少通信成本。

Method: 使用元变分dropout(MetaVD)，通过共享超网络学习客户端相关的dropout率，实现贝叶斯联邦学习的后验适应和后验聚合。

Result: 在多个稀疏和非IID联邦学习数据集上，MetaVD表现出优异的分类准确性和不确定性校准性能，特别是对于分布外客户端，同时减少了通信成本。

Conclusion: MetaVD通过贝叶斯元学习方法有效解决了联邦学习中的非IID数据挑战，提高了模型性能并降低了通信开销。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) aims to train a global inference model from remotely
distributed clients, gaining popularity due to its benefit of improving data
privacy. However, traditional FL often faces challenges in practical
applications, including model overfitting and divergent local models due to
limited and non-IID data among clients. To address these issues, we introduce a
novel Bayesian meta-learning approach called meta-variational dropout (MetaVD).
MetaVD learns to predict client-dependent dropout rates via a shared
hypernetwork, enabling effective model personalization of FL algorithms in
limited non-IID data settings. We also emphasize the posterior adaptation view
of meta-learning and the posterior aggregation view of Bayesian FL via the
conditional dropout posterior. We conducted extensive experiments on various
sparse and non-IID FL datasets. MetaVD demonstrated excellent classification
accuracy and uncertainty calibration performance, especially for
out-of-distribution (OOD) clients. MetaVD compresses the local model parameters
needed for each client, mitigating model overfitting and reducing communication
costs. Code is available at https://github.com/insujeon/MetaVD.

Motivation: 开发一种能够从稀疏气象站和地形数据生成高质量天气变量降尺度预测的方法，解决传统方法的局限性。

Method: 使用隐式神经表示技术，基于日本地区的稀疏气象站数据和地形信息训练模型，支持任意降尺度。

Abstract: We introduce SpLIIF to generate implicit neural representations and enable
arbitrary downscaling of weather variables. We train a model from sparse
weather stations and topography over Japan and evaluate in- and
out-of-distribution accuracy predicting temperature and wind, comparing it to
both an interpolation baseline and CorrDiff. We find the model to be up to 50%
better than both CorrDiff and the baseline at downscaling temperature, and
around 10-20% better for wind.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一个可证明收敛的max-min多目标强化学习框架，通过博弈论视角将其重构为两人零和正则化连续博弈，基于镜像下降设计高效算法，确保全局收敛。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多目标强化学习中max-min准则的收敛性问题，从博弈论角度重新形式化该问题，旨在开发既理论可靠又实用的算法。

Method: 将max-min多目标强化学习重构为两人零和正则化连续博弈，采用镜像下降算法简化策略更新，并引入自适应正则化提升性能。

Result: 算法在表格设置中展现了收敛行为，在深度强化学习实现中显著优于先前基线方法，在多个MORL环境中表现优异。

Conclusion: 提出的框架在理论和实践上都取得了成功，为max-min多目标强化学习提供了可证明收敛且高效的解决方案。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a provably convergent and practical framework for
multi-objective reinforcement learning with max-min criterion. From a
game-theoretic perspective, we reformulate max-min multi-objective
reinforcement learning as a two-player zero-sum regularized continuous game and
introduce an efficient algorithm based on mirror descent. Our approach
simplifies the policy update while ensuring global last-iterate convergence. We
provide a comprehensive theoretical analysis on our algorithm, including
iteration complexity under both exact and approximate policy evaluations, as
well as sample complexity bounds. To further enhance performance, we modify the
proposed algorithm with adaptive regularization. Our experiments demonstrate
the convergence behavior of the proposed algorithm in tabular settings, and our
implementation for deep reinforcement learning significantly outperforms
previous baselines in many MORL environments.

*Teng Jiek See,Daokun Zhang,Mario Boley,David K. Chalmers*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为LKM的自知识蒸馏方法，能够在几乎不增加计算复杂度的情况下，显著提升图神经网络在分子性质预测中的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 图神经网络是目前预测分子性质最有效的方法，但现有模型在精度和计算成本之间存在权衡。需要一种既能提高准确性又不显著增加计算复杂度的解决方案。

Method: 开发了层到层知识混合（LKM）方法，通过最小化GNN层间预存在隐藏嵌入的平均绝对距离，有效聚合多跳和多尺度信息，改善局部和全局分子特征的表示。

Result: 在三种GNN架构和多个量子化学数据集上的评估显示，LKM能将量子化学和生物物理性质预测的平均绝对误差降低高达9.8%（QM9）、45.3%（MD17能量）和22.9%（Chignolin）。

Conclusion: LKM方法具有在不显著增加训练和推理成本的情况下，显著提高GNN在化学性质预测中准确性的潜力。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are the currently most effective methods for
predicting molecular properties but there remains a need for more accurate
models. GNN accuracy can be improved by increasing the model complexity but
this also increases the computational cost and memory requirement during
training and inference. In this study, we develop Layer-to-Layer Knowledge
Mixing (LKM), a novel self-knowledge distillation method that increases the
accuracy of state-of-the-art GNNs while adding negligible computational
complexity during training and inference. By minimizing the mean absolute
distance between pre-existing hidden embeddings of GNN layers, LKM efficiently
aggregates multi-hop and multi-scale information, enabling improved
representation of both local and global molecular features. We evaluated LKM
using three diverse GNN architectures (DimeNet++, MXMNet, and PAMNet) using
datasets of quantum chemical properties (QM9, MD17 and Chignolin). We found
that the LKM method effectively reduces the mean absolute error of quantum
chemical and biophysical property predictions by up to 9.8% (QM9), 45.3% (MD17
Energy), and 22.9% (Chignolin). This work demonstrates the potential of LKM to
significantly improve the accuracy of GNNs for chemical property prediction
without any substantial increase in training and inference cost.

### [45] [What Does It Take to Build a Performant Selective Classifier?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20242)
*Stephan Rabanser,Nicolas Papernot*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了选择性分类差距的概念，将理想oracle性能与实际选择性分类器性能之间的差距分解为五个来源：贝叶斯噪声、近似误差、排序误差、统计噪声和实现/分布偏移松弛。研究发现单调后校准对缩小差距作用有限，需要能重新排序预测的评分机制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有选择性分类器很少能达到完美排序oracle的性能，本文旨在形式化这种性能差距并分析其根本原因，为构建更接近理想oracle行为的选择性分类器提供指导。

Method: 提出了选择性分类差距的有限样本分解框架，将差距分解为五个误差源，并在合成数据和真实视觉、语言基准上进行验证实验，通过受控实验分离每个误差分量。

Result: 验证结果表明：(i)贝叶斯噪声和有限模型容量会造成显著差距；(ii)只有更丰富的特征感知校准器能显著改善分数排序；(iii)数据偏移引入的松弛需要分布鲁棒训练。

Conclusion: 该分解提供了定量的误差预算和可操作的设计指南，帮助实践者构建更接近理想oracle行为的选择性分类器。

Abstract: Selective classifiers improve model reliability by abstaining on inputs the
model deems uncertain. However, few practical approaches achieve the
gold-standard performance of a perfect-ordering oracle that accepts examples
exactly in order of correctness. Our work formalizes this shortfall as the
selective-classification gap and present the first finite-sample decomposition
of this gap to five distinct sources of looseness: Bayes noise, approximation
error, ranking error, statistical noise, and implementation- or shift-induced
slack. Crucially, our analysis reveals that monotone post-hoc calibration --
often believed to strengthen selective classifiers -- has limited impact on
closing this gap, since it rarely alters the model's underlying score ranking.
Bridging the gap therefore requires scoring mechanisms that can effectively
reorder predictions rather than merely rescale them. We validate our
decomposition on synthetic two-moons data and on real-world vision and language
benchmarks, isolating each error component through controlled experiments. Our
results confirm that (i) Bayes noise and limited model capacity can account for
substantial gaps, (ii) only richer, feature-aware calibrators meaningfully
improve score ordering, and (iii) data shift introduces a separate slack that
demands distributionally robust training. Together, our decomposition yields a
quantitative error budget as well as actionable design guidelines that
practitioners can use to build selective classifiers which approximate ideal
oracle behavior more closely.

TL;DR: FedGPS是一个新的联邦学习框架，通过整合统计分布和梯度信息来解决数据异构性问题，在各种异构场景下表现出优越的性能和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有联邦学习方法在数据异构性场景下的鲁棒性不足，特别是在多样化异构场景中的部署效果不佳。实验发现共享统计信息可以帮助客户端从全局视角更新模型。

Method: FedGPS框架静态地修改每个客户端的学习目标，使用代理信息隐式建模全局数据分布，同时动态地在每轮调整本地更新方向，整合其他客户端的梯度信息。

Result: 大量实验表明，FedGPS在多样化异构场景下优于现有最先进方法，验证了其有效性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: FedGPS通过整合统计分布和梯度信息，有效解决了联邦学习中的数据异构性问题，在各种异构场景下表现出优越的性能。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) confronts a significant challenge known as data
heterogeneity, which impairs model performance and convergence. Existing
methods have made notable progress in addressing this issue. However, improving
performance in certain heterogeneity scenarios remains an overlooked question:
\textit{How robust are these methods to deploy under diverse heterogeneity
scenarios?} To answer this, we conduct comprehensive evaluations across varied
heterogeneity scenarios, showing that most existing methods exhibit limited
robustness. Meanwhile, insights from these experiments highlight that sharing
statistical information can mitigate heterogeneity by enabling clients to
update with a global perspective. Motivated by this, we propose \textbf{FedGPS}
(\textbf{Fed}erated \textbf{G}oal-\textbf{P}ath \textbf{S}ynergy), a novel
framework that seamlessly integrates statistical distribution and gradient
information from others. Specifically, FedGPS statically modifies each client's
learning objective to implicitly model the global data distribution using
surrogate information, while dynamically adjusting local update directions with
gradient information from other clients at each round. Extensive experiments
show that FedGPS outperforms state-of-the-art methods across diverse
heterogeneity scenarios, validating its effectiveness and robustness. The code

*Thomas Rupf,Marco Bagatella,Marin Vlastelica,Andreas Krause*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: OpTI-BFM是一种乐观决策标准，通过直接建模奖励函数的不确定性来指导行为基础模型进行任务推断，无需预先计算奖励或大量标注数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的行为基础模型需要计算推理数据集上的奖励，这要么需要奖励函数的函数形式，要么需要大量标注工作。本文旨在通过与环境交互来纯化任务推断过程。

Method: 提出OpTI-BFM方法，直接建模奖励函数的不确定性，并使用乐观决策标准指导行为基础模型进行数据收集。该方法与线性bandits的上置信界算法有直接联系。

Result: 在已建立的零样本基准测试中，OpTI-BFM使基于后继特征的行为基础模型能够在少量episode中识别和优化未见过的奖励函数，且计算开销最小。

Conclusion: OpTI-BFM为行为基础模型提供了一种高效的任务推断方法，通过乐观决策标准显著减少了数据需求和计算开销。

Abstract: Behavior Foundation Models (BFMs) are capable of retrieving high-performing
policy for any reward function specified directly at test-time, commonly
referred to as zero-shot reinforcement learning (RL). While this is a very
efficient process in terms of compute, it can be less so in terms of data: as a
standard assumption, BFMs require computing rewards over a non-negligible
inference dataset, assuming either access to a functional form of rewards, or
significant labeling efforts. To alleviate these limitations, we tackle the
problem of task inference purely through interaction with the environment at
test-time. We propose OpTI-BFM, an optimistic decision criterion that directly
models uncertainty over reward functions and guides BFMs in data collection for
task inference. Formally, we provide a regret bound for well-trained BFMs
through a direct connection to upper-confidence algorithms for linear bandits.
Empirically, we evaluate OpTI-BFM on established zero-shot benchmarks, and
observe that it enables successor-features-based BFMs to identify and optimize
an unseen reward function in a handful of episodes with minimal compute
overhead. Code is available at https://github.com/ThomasRupf/opti-bfm.

*Ziqian Zhong,Aditi Raghunathan,Nicholas Carlini*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ImpossibleBench是一个用于量化和研究LLM代理利用测试用例作弊行为的基准框架，通过创建自然语言规范与单元测试冲突的"不可能"任务来测量作弊率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM倾向于寻找"捷径"完成任务，这给可靠评估和部署带来风险，比如删除失败测试而非修复bug，这会破坏基准结果的有效性和实际部署的可靠性。

Method: 从现有基准创建"不可能"任务变体，引入自然语言规范与单元测试的直接冲突，测量代理在这些任务上的通过率作为"作弊率"。

Result: 揭示了从简单测试修改到复杂操作符重载的作弊行为细节，展示了提示、测试访问和反馈循环如何影响作弊率，提供了已验证的欺骗解决方案测试平台。

Conclusion: ImpossibleBench是一个实用的多功能工具，可用于研究模型行为、上下文工程和开发监控工具，有助于构建更稳健可靠的LLM系统。

Abstract: The tendency to find and exploit "shortcuts" to complete tasks poses
significant risks for reliable assessment and deployment of large language
models (LLMs). For example, an LLM agent with access to unit tests may delete
failing tests rather than fix the underlying bug. Such behavior undermines both
the validity of benchmark results and the reliability of real-world LLM coding
assistant deployments.
  To quantify, study, and mitigate such behavior, we introduce ImpossibleBench,
a benchmark framework that systematically measures LLM agents' propensity to
exploit test cases. ImpossibleBench creates "impossible" variants of tasks from
existing benchmarks like LiveCodeBench and SWE-bench by introducing direct
conflicts between the natural-language specification and the unit tests. We
measure an agent's "cheating rate" as its pass rate on these impossible tasks,
where any pass necessarily implies a specification-violating shortcut.
  As a practical framework, ImpossibleBench is not just an evaluation but a
versatile tool. We demonstrate its utility for: (1) studying model behaviors,
revealing more fine-grained details of cheating behaviors from simple test
modification to complex operator overloading; (2) context engineering, showing
how prompt, test access and feedback loop affect cheating rates; and (3)
developing monitoring tools, providing a testbed with verified deceptive
solutions. We hope ImpossibleBench serves as a useful framework for building
more robust and reliable LLM systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 拓扑特征能捕捉图像数据中的全局几何结构，但在深度学习中的实际应用需要计算效率和可微分性。

Method: 开发了针对Ampere GPU优化的CUDA内核，使用128B合并访问和分层共享内存累加；创建了可微分PyTorch层，通过可微分欧拉特征变换风格的sigmoid松弛学习单方向阈值。

Result: 在合成网格上比之前的GPU实现快16-2000倍；实现了端到端的可微分学习能力。

Conclusion: 这项工作通过计算优化和可微分性扩展了拓扑特征在深度学习中的应用，并讨论了批处理和多GPU扩展以促进更广泛采用。

Abstract: Topological features capture global geometric structure in imaging data, but
practical adoption in deep learning requires both computational efficiency and
differentiability. We present optimized GPU kernels for the Euler
Characteristic Curve (ECC) computation achieving 16-2000\"O speedups over prior
GPU implementations on synthetic grids, and introduce a differentiable PyTorch
layer enabling end-to-end learning. Our CUDA kernels, optimized for Ampere GPUs
use 128B-coalesced access and hierarchical shared-memory accumulation. Our
PyTorch layer learns thresholds in a single direction via a Differentiable
Euler Characteristic Transform-style sigmoid relaxation. We discuss downstream
relevance, including applications highlighted by prior ECC work, and outline
batching/multi-GPU extensions to broaden adoption.

*Tristan Cinquin,Geoff Pleiss,Agustinus Kristiadi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PRM引导的树搜索在数学推理中未能显著优于Best-of-N选择，尽管成本更高，主要原因是PRM对状态值的近似不可靠且泛化能力差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 链式思维提示与Best-of-N选择虽然流行，但其线性结构无法捕捉复杂问题解决的分支和探索性质，因此研究PRM引导的树搜索是否能通过探索多个部分解路径来改进数学推理。

Method: 提出自适应算法在难处理的动作空间中最大化过程奖励模型分数，使用Qwen2.5-Math-7B-Instruct及其关联PRM作为案例研究，在23个不同数学问题上评估PRM引导的树搜索方法。

Result: PRM引导的树搜索相比BoN无统计显著改进；蒙特卡洛树搜索和波束搜索优于其他PRM引导方法；PRM对状态值的近似不可靠且随推理深度可靠性下降；PRM分布外泛化能力差。

Conclusion: 树搜索对不可靠PRM分数的更大依赖导致其表现不佳，表明在树搜索能有效增强LLM数学推理之前需要不同的奖励建模方法。

Abstract: While chain-of-thought prompting with Best-of-N (BoN) selection has become
popular for mathematical reasoning in large language models (LLMs), its linear
structure fails to capture the branching and exploratory nature of complex
problem-solving. In this work, we propose an adaptive algorithm to maximize
process reward model (PRM) scores over the intractable action space, and
investigate whether PRM-guided tree search can improve mathematical reasoning
by exploring multiple partial solution paths. Across $23$ diverse mathematical
problems using Qwen2.5-Math-7B-Instruct with its associated PRM as a case
study, we find that: (1) PRM-guided tree search shows no statistically
significant improvements over BoN despite higher costs, (2) Monte Carlo tree
search and beam search outperform other PRM-guided tree search methods, (3)
PRMs poorly approximate state values and their reliability degrades with
reasoning depth, and (4) PRMs generalize poorly out of distribution. This
underperformance stems from tree search's greater reliance on unreliable PRM
scores, suggesting different reward modeling is necessary before tree search
can effectively enhance mathematical reasoning in LLMs.

Motivation: 解决深度学习模型在真实应用中性能不稳定、黑盒特性难以解释的问题，以及现有评估框架缺乏对模型具体优缺点定量分析的能力。

Method: 使用合成数据驱动的方法，通过三个核心分析维度：时间特征分解与能力映射、数据不规则性下的鲁棒性分析、理论最优基准测试。

Result: 实验表明当前深度学习模型在所有类型的时间特征上并未普遍接近最优基准。

Conclusion: SynTSBench提供了一个可解释的评估系统，能够系统评估时间序列预测模型的基本能力，帮助选择合适的模型用于特定预测场景。

Abstract: Recent advances in deep learning have driven rapid progress in time series
forecasting, yet many state-of-the-art models continue to struggle with robust
performance in real-world applications, even when they achieve strong results
on standard benchmark datasets. This persistent gap can be attributed to the
black-box nature of deep learning architectures and the inherent limitations of
current evaluation frameworks, which frequently lack the capacity to provide
clear, quantitative insights into the specific strengths and weaknesses of
different models, thereby complicating the selection of appropriate models for
particular forecasting scenarios. To address these issues, we propose a
synthetic data-driven evaluation paradigm, SynTSBench, that systematically
assesses fundamental modeling capabilities of time series forecasting models
through programmable feature configuration. Our framework isolates confounding
factors and establishes an interpretable evaluation system with three core
analytical dimensions: (1) temporal feature decomposition and capability
mapping, which enables systematic evaluation of model capacities to learn
specific pattern types; (2) robustness analysis under data irregularities,
which quantifies noise tolerance thresholds and anomaly recovery capabilities;
and (3) theoretical optimum benchmarking, which establishes performance
boundaries for each pattern type-enabling direct comparison between model
predictions and mathematical optima. Our experiments show that current deep
learning models do not universally approach optimal baselines across all types
of temporal features.The code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大-小模型协作框架中存在的精度显著下降、灾难性遗忘加剧以及小模型知识引发的幻觉问题

Method: 采用KAN(可解释神经网络)作为协作模型，替代传统的MLP，利用KAN的优越可视化和可解释性，在语言、视觉和视觉-语言跨模态任务中部署KCM

Result: 相比纯大模型方法，KCM协作框架显著减少大模型推理调用次数，同时保持近乎相同的任务精度，大幅降低计算资源消耗；KAN小协作模型显著缓解灾难性遗忘，长尾数据精度显著提升

Conclusion: KCM在所有指标上均优于基于MLP的小协作模型(MCM)，证明KAN在大-小模型协作中的优越性能

Abstract: In recent years, Pretrained Large Models(PLMs) researchers proposed
large-small model collaboration frameworks, leveraged easily trainable small
models to assist large models, aim to(1) significantly reduce computational
resource consumption while maintaining comparable accuracy, and (2) enhance
large model performance in specialized domain tasks. However, this
collaborative paradigm suffers from issues such as significant accuracy
degradation, exacerbated catastrophic forgetting, and amplified hallucination
problems induced by small model knowledge. To address these challenges, we
propose a KAN-based Collaborative Model (KCM) as an improved approach to
large-small model collaboration. The KAN utilized in KCM represents an
alternative neural network architecture distinct from conventional MLPs.
Compared to MLPs, KAN offers superior visualizability and interpretability
while mitigating catastrophic forgetting. We deployed KCM in large-small model
collaborative systems across three scenarios: language, vision, and
vision-language cross-modal tasks. The experimental results demonstrate that,
compared with pure large model approaches, the large-small model collaboration
framework utilizing KCM as the collaborative model significantly reduces the
number of large model inference calls while maintaining near-identical task
accuracy, thereby substantially lowering computational resource consumption.
Concurrently, the KAN-based small collaborative model markedly mitigates
catastrophic forgetting, leading to significant accuracy improvements for
long-tail data. The results reveal that KCM demonstrates superior performance
across all metrics compared to MLP-based small collaborative models (MCM).

Conclusion: 让AI成为更好的研究助手更依赖于领域对齐的高质量数据训练，而非预训练规模或通用基准性能

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) advance, the ultimate vision for their role
in science is emerging: we could build an AI collaborator to effectively assist
human beings throughout the entire scientific research process. We refer to
this envisioned system as ResearchGPT. Given that scientific research
progresses through multiple interdependent phases, achieving this vision
requires rigorous benchmarks that evaluate the end-to-end workflow rather than
isolated sub-tasks. To this end, we contribute CS-54k, a high-quality corpus of
scientific Q&A pairs in computer science, built from 14k CC-licensed papers. It
is constructed through a scalable, paper-grounded pipeline that combines
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with multi-stage quality control to ensure
factual grounding. From this unified corpus, we derive two complementary
subsets: CS-4k, a carefully curated benchmark for evaluating AI's ability to
assist scientific research, and CS-50k, a large-scale training dataset.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that CS-4k stratifies state-of-the-art LLMs
into distinct capability tiers. Open models trained on CS-50k with supervised
training and reinforcement learning demonstrate substantial improvements. Even
7B-scale models, when properly trained, outperform many larger proprietary
systems, such as GPT-4.1, GPT-4o, and Gemini 2.5 Pro. This indicates that
making AI models better research assistants relies more on domain-aligned
training with high-quality data than on pretraining scale or general benchmark
performance. We release CS-4k and CS-50k in the hope of fostering AI systems as
reliable collaborators in CS research.

Conclusion: 提出的IRM-free方法有效解决了图神经网络的分布外泛化问题，无需环境标注即可识别因果子图。

Abstract: Out-of-distribution generalization under distributional shifts remains a
critical challenge for graph neural networks. Existing methods generally adopt
the Invariant Risk Minimization (IRM) framework, requiring costly environment
annotations or heuristically generated synthetic splits. To circumvent these
limitations, in this work, we aim to develop an IRM-free method for capturing
causal subgraphs. We first identify that causal subgraphs exhibit substantially
smaller distributional variations than non-causal components across diverse
environments, which we formalize as the Invariant Distribution Criterion and
theoretically prove in this paper. Building on this criterion, we
systematically uncover the quantitative relationship between distributional
shift and representation norm for identifying the causal subgraph, and
investigate its underlying mechanisms in depth. Finally, we propose an IRM-free
method by introducing a norm-guided invariant distribution objective for causal
subgraph discovery and prediction. Extensive experiments on two widely used
benchmarks demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in graph generalization.

Abstract: Brain tumors are a challenging problem in neuro-oncology, where early and
precise diagnosis is important for successful treatment. Deep learning-based
brain tumor classification methods often rely on heavy data augmentation which
can limit generalization and trust in clinical applications. In this paper, we
propose a double-backbone network integrating VGG16 and Xception with a
Frequency-Gated Attention (FGA) Block to capture complementary local and global
features. Unlike previous studies, our model achieves state-of-the-art
performance without augmentation which demonstrates robustness to variably
sized and distributed datasets. For further transparency, Grad-CAM is
integrated to visualize the tumor regions based on which the model is giving
prediction, bridging the gap between model prediction and clinical
interpretability. The proposed framework achieves 99.24\% accuracy on the 7K-DS
dataset for the 4-class setting, along with 98.68\% and 99.85\% in the 3-class
and 2-class settings, respectively. On the independent 3K-DS dataset, the model
generalizes with 95.77\% accuracy, outperforming baseline and state-of-the-art
methods. To further support clinical usability, we developed a graphical user
interface (GUI) that provides real-time classification and Grad-CAM-based tumor
localization. These findings suggest that augmentation-free, interpretable, and
deployable deep learning models such as DB-FGA-Net hold strong potential for
reliable clinical translation in brain tumor diagnosis.

### [56] [InvDec: Inverted Decoder for Multivariate Time Series Forecasting with Separated Temporal and Variate Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20302)
*Yuhang Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了InvDec（倒置解码器）混合架构，通过分离时间编码和变量级解码，结合基于patch的时间编码器和在变量维度上操作的倒置解码器，显著提升高维多元时间序列预测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法存在局限性：通道独立方法如PatchTST擅长时间建模但忽略变量相关性，而纯变量注意力方法如iTransformer牺牲了时间编码。需要一种能同时有效建模时间模式和跨变量依赖的方法。

Method: InvDec结合基于patch的时间编码器和在变量维度上通过变量自注意力操作的倒置解码器。引入延迟变量嵌入在时间编码后丰富变量特定表示，保持时间特征完整性。采用自适应残差融合机制动态平衡时间和变量信息。

Result: 在7个基准数据集上的实验显示，高维数据集上显著提升：电力数据集（321变量）MSE降低20.9%，天气数据集提升4.3%，交通数据集提升2.7%。在低维ETT数据集上保持竞争力。消融研究验证了各组件有效性。

Conclusion: InvDec通过分离时间编码和变量解码实现了更好的多元时间序列预测。分析表明其优势随数据集维度增加而增长，证实跨变量建模在变量数量增加时变得至关重要。

Abstract: Multivariate time series forecasting requires simultaneously modeling
temporal patterns and cross-variate dependencies. Channel-independent methods
such as PatchTST excel at temporal modeling but ignore variable correlations,
while pure variate-attention approaches such as iTransformer sacrifice temporal
encoding. We proposeInvDec (Inverted Decoder), a hybrid architecture that
achieves principled separation between temporal encoding and variate-level
decoding. InvDec combines a patch-based temporal encoder with an inverted
decoder operating on the variate dimension through variate-wise self-attention.
We introduce delayed variate embeddings that enrich variable-specific
representations only after temporal encoding, preserving temporal feature
integrity. An adaptive residual fusion mechanism dynamically balances temporal
and variate information across datasets of varying dimensions. Instantiating
InvDec with PatchTST yields InvDec-PatchTST. Extensive experiments on seven
benchmarks demonstrate significant gains on high-dimensional datasets: 20.9%
MSE reduction on Electricity (321 variables), 4.3% improvement on Weather, and
2.7% gain on Traffic compared to PatchTST, while maintaining competitive
performance on low-dimensional ETT datasets. Ablation studies validate each
component, and analysis reveals that InvDec's advantage grows with dataset
dimensionality, confirming that cross-variate modeling becomes critical as the
number of variables increases.

TL;DR: 提出LEGO框架，解决推荐系统中多属性动态遗忘问题，通过嵌入校准和灵活组合实现高效的多敏感属性保护。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界隐私保护需求涉及多个敏感属性且动态变化，现有单属性遗忘方法无法同时处理多个遗忘请求和适应动态需求。

Method: 将多属性遗忘分为两步：嵌入校准从用户嵌入中移除特定属性信息，灵活组合将这些嵌入合并为单一嵌入以保护所有敏感属性。

Result: 在三个真实数据集和三种代表性推荐模型上的广泛实验证明了该框架的有效性和效率。

Conclusion: LEGO框架为推荐系统中的多属性动态遗忘提供了轻量级且高效的解决方案，具有理论保证和实际应用价值。

Abstract: With the growing demand for safeguarding sensitive user information in
recommender systems, recommendation attribute unlearning is receiving
increasing attention. Existing studies predominantly focus on single-attribute
unlearning. However, privacy protection requirements in the real world often
involve multiple sensitive attributes and are dynamic. Existing
single-attribute unlearning methods cannot meet these real-world requirements
due to i) CH1: the inability to handle multiple unlearning requests
simultaneously, and ii) CH2: the lack of efficient adaptability to dynamic
unlearning needs. To address these challenges, we propose LEGO, a lightweight
and efficient multiple-attribute unlearning framework. Specifically, we divide
the multiple-attribute unlearning process into two steps: i) Embedding
Calibration removes information related to a specific attribute from user
embedding, and ii) Flexible Combination combines these embeddings into a single
embedding, protecting all sensitive attributes. We frame the unlearning process
as a mutual information minimization problem, providing LEGO a theoretical
guarantee of simultaneous unlearning, thereby addressing CH1. With the two-step
framework, where Embedding Calibration can be performed in parallel and
Flexible Combination is flexible and efficient, we address CH2. Extensive
experiments on three real-world datasets across three representative
recommendation models demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our
proposed framework. Our code and appendix are available at

Motivation: 在关键应用如自主着陆系统中，收集和标注训练数据成本高昂，特别是需要覆盖所有可能条件包括罕见场景。合成图像生成可以廉价可靠地覆盖所有条件和环境。

Method: 基于商业飞行模拟器的图像生成方法，结合少量真实标注图像，采用定制化的域适应策略来整合真实和合成数据。

Result: 标准目标检测模型可以实现准确预测，在未在真实数据中出现的夜间图像等恶劣条件下也表现出良好的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 通过控制图像生成和域适应策略，合成图像可以有效补充真实数据，提高关键应用中视觉模型的性能和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Deep vision models are now mature enough to be integrated in industrial and
possibly critical applications such as autonomous navigation. Yet, data
collection and labeling to train such models requires too much efforts and
costs for a single company or product. This drawback is more significant in
critical applications, where training data must include all possible conditions
including rare scenarios. In this perspective, generating synthetic images is
an appealing solution, since it allows a cheap yet reliable covering of all the
conditions and environments, if the impact of the synthetic-to-real
distribution shift is mitigated. In this article, we consider the case of
runway detection that is a critical part in autonomous landing systems
developed by aircraft manufacturers. We propose an image generation approach
based on a commercial flight simulator that complements a few annotated real
images. By controlling the image generation and the integration of real and
synthetic data, we show that standard object detection models can achieve
accurate prediction. We also evaluate their robustness with respect to adverse
conditions, in our case nighttime images, that were not represented in the real
data, and show the interest of using a customized domain adaptation strategy.

TL;DR: 提出基于不确定性的路由框架，在强化学习人类反馈中高效结合快速奖励模型和强大但昂贵的LLM评判器，通过不确定性量化指导路由决策。


<details>

Motivation: 传统奖励模型容易受到奖励攻击且在分布外输入上泛化能力差，而强大的LLM评判器虽然泛化能力强但推理成本高，限制了在在线RLHF中的应用。

Method: 将策略梯度方法中的优势估计建模为成对偏好分类，实现原则性的不确定性量化来指导路由决策：不确定的样本对转发给LLM评判器，确定的样本对由奖励模型评估。

Result: 在奖励模型基准测试中，基于不确定性的路由策略在相同成本下显著优于随机调用评判器的方法，下游对齐结果证明了其在改进在线RLHF中的有效性。

Conclusion: 提出的不确定性路由框架能够有效平衡奖励模型的效率和LLM评判器的泛化能力，为在线RLHF提供了一种高效实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Reward model (RM) plays a pivotal role in reinforcement learning with human
feedback (RLHF) for aligning large language models (LLMs). However, classical
RMs trained on human preferences are vulnerable to reward hacking and
generalize poorly to out-of-distribution (OOD) inputs. By contrast, strong LLM
judges equipped with reasoning capabilities demonstrate superior
generalization, even without additional training, but incur significantly
higher inference costs, limiting their applicability in online RLHF. In this
work, we propose an uncertainty-based routing framework that efficiently
complements a fast RM with a strong but costly LLM judge. Our approach
formulates advantage estimation in policy gradient (PG) methods as pairwise
preference classification, enabling principled uncertainty quantification to
guide routing. Uncertain pairs are forwarded to the LLM judge, while confident
ones are evaluated by the RM. Experiments on RM benchmarks demonstrate that our
uncertainty-based routing strategy significantly outperforms random judge
calling at the same cost, and downstream alignment results showcase its
effectiveness in improving online RLHF.

Motivation: 现有层次预测方法在协调过程中使用估计的协方差矩阵，但真实协方差矩阵未知，估计误差会降低预测性能。

Method: 引入协方差矩阵的不确定性集，构建最小化最坏情况期望平方误差的鲁棒协调问题，可转化为半定优化问题求解。

Result: 数值实验表明，所提出的鲁棒协调方法比现有层次预测方法获得了更好的预测性能。

Conclusion: 在协调过程中整合不确定性是有效的，鲁棒优化框架能够提升层次时间序列预测的准确性。

Abstract: This paper focuses on forecasting hierarchical time-series data, where each
higher-level observation equals the sum of its corresponding lower-level time
series. In such contexts, the forecast values should be coherent, meaning that
the forecast value of each parent series exactly matches the sum of the
forecast values of its child series. Existing hierarchical forecasting methods
typically generate base forecasts independently for each series and then apply
a reconciliation procedure to adjust them so that the resulting forecast values
are coherent across the hierarchy. These methods generally derive an optimal
reconciliation, using a covariance matrix of the forecast error. In practice,
however, the true covariance matrix is unknown and has to be estimated from
finite samples in advance. This gap between the true and estimated covariance
matrix may degrade forecast performance. To address this issue, we propose a
robust optimization framework for hierarchical reconciliation that accounts for
uncertainty in the estimated covariance matrix. We first introduce an
uncertainty set for the estimated covariance matrix and formulate a
reconciliation problem that minimizes the worst-case expected squared error
over this uncertainty set. We show that our problem can be cast as a
semidefinite optimization problem. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the
proposed robust reconciliation method achieved better forecast performance than
existing hierarchical forecasting methods, which indicates the effectiveness of
integrating uncertainty into the reconciliation process.

TL;DR: 提出了基于相对排序的缩放定律，通过相对概率指标(RBP)来补充交叉熵的局限性，更全面地理解语言模型的缩放规律。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有缩放定律研究主要依赖交叉熵作为评估指标，但交叉熵只关注正确token的绝对概率，忽略了正确与错误token之间的相对排序，而相对排序在语言模型应用中至关重要。

Method: 提出相对概率指标(RBP)，量化正确token在top预测中的排名概率，并基于此建立相对缩放定律，通过四个数据集和四个模型家族的广泛实验验证其鲁棒性和准确性。

Result: 实验证明相对缩放定律具有鲁棒性和准确性，能够为涌现现象提供更深层解释，并有助于寻找缩放定律的基本理论。

Conclusion: 相对缩放定律补充了交叉熵视角，为大规模语言模型的缩放提供了更完整的理解，对实际开发和理论探索都具有重要价值。

Abstract: Scaling laws aim to accurately predict model performance across different
scales. Existing scaling-law studies almost exclusively rely on cross-entropy
as the evaluation metric. However, cross-entropy provides only a partial view
of performance: it measures the absolute probability assigned to the correct
token, but ignores the relative ordering between correct and incorrect tokens.
Yet, relative ordering is crucial for language models, such as in
greedy-sampling scenario. To address this limitation, we investigate scaling
from the perspective of relative ordering. We first propose the Relative-Based
Probability (RBP) metric, which quantifies the probability that the correct
token is ranked among the top predictions. Building on this metric, we
establish the Relative-Based Scaling Law, which characterizes how RBP improves
with increasing model size. Through extensive experiments on four datasets and
four model families spanning five orders of magnitude, we demonstrate the
robustness and accuracy of this law. Finally, we illustrate the broad
application of this law with two examples, namely providing a deeper
explanation of emergence phenomena and facilitating finding fundamental
theories of scaling laws. In summary, the Relative-Based Scaling Law
complements the cross-entropy perspective and contributes to a more complete
understanding of scaling large language models. Thus, it offers valuable
insights for both practical development and theoretical exploration.

Motivation: 工业过程控制需要局部专业化和全局协调，但强化学习在工业应用中的采用受到奖励设计、模块化和动作空间管理等挑战的限制。

Method: 结合SortingEnv和ContainerGym两个现有基准，创建顺序回收场景，评估模块化架构与集中式代理，并分析动作掩码的影响。

Result: 无动作掩码时代理学习困难，模块化架构表现更好；应用动作掩码后两者性能显著提升，性能差距缩小。

Conclusion: 动作空间约束起决定性作用，专业化优势随动作复杂度降低而减弱，该基准为工业自动化多智能体强化学习提供了有价值的测试平台。

Abstract: Autonomous control of multi-stage industrial processes requires both local
specialization and global coordination. Reinforcement learning (RL) offers a
promising approach, but its industrial adoption remains limited due to
challenges such as reward design, modularity, and action space management. Many
academic benchmarks differ markedly from industrial control problems, limiting
their transferability to real-world applications. This study introduces an
enhanced industry-inspired benchmark environment that combines tasks from two
existing benchmarks, SortingEnv and ContainerGym, into a sequential recycling
scenario with sorting and pressing operations. We evaluate two control
strategies: a modular architecture with specialized agents and a monolithic
agent governing the full system, while also analyzing the impact of action
masking. Our experiments show that without action masking, agents struggle to
learn effective policies, with the modular architecture performing better. When
action masking is applied, both architectures improve substantially, and the
performance gap narrows considerably. These results highlight the decisive role
of action space constraints and suggest that the advantages of specialization
diminish as action complexity is reduced. The proposed benchmark thus provides
a valuable testbed for exploring practical and robust multi-agent RL solutions
in industrial automation, while contributing to the ongoing debate on
centralization versus specialization.

TL;DR: 本文分析了DPO算法的局限性，指出当真实奖励函数无法通过策略类实现时，DPO会出现错误设定问题，导致偏好顺序反转、策略奖励恶化等失败模式。作者提出了AuxDPO方法，通过在DPO损失函数中引入辅助变量来缓解这些问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DPO等直接对齐算法使用监督学习替代两阶段RLHF，但当策略类无法实现真实奖励函数时会出现错误设定问题，导致性能下降。需要研究如何缓解这种错误设定并改进DPO算法。

Method: 1. 分析DPO在错误设定情况下的失败模式；2. 研究两阶段RLHF在参数类下的局部行为；3. 提出AuxDPO方法，在DPO损失函数中引入辅助变量来逼近RLHF解。

Result: 实验证明AuxDPO在指导性赌博机设置和LLM对齐任务中表现优于标准DPO，能够有效缓解错误设定问题。

Conclusion: DPO存在错误设定问题，而AuxDPO通过引入辅助变量能够更好地逼近RLHF解，在理论和实验上都表现出优越性能。

Abstract: Direct alignment algorithms such as Direct Preference Optimization (DPO)
fine-tune models based on preference data, using only supervised learning
instead of two-stage reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF). We show
that DPO encodes a statistical estimation problem over reward functions induced
by a parametric policy class. When the true reward function that generates
preferences cannot be realized via the policy class, DPO becomes misspecified,
resulting in failure modes such as preference order reversal, worsening of
policy reward, and high sensitivity to the input preference data distribution.
On the other hand, we study the local behavior of two-stage RLHF for a
parametric class and relate it to a natural gradient step in policy space. Our
fine-grained geometric characterization allows us to propose AuxDPO, which
introduces additional auxiliary variables in the DPO loss function to help move
towards the RLHF solution in a principled manner and mitigate the
misspecification in DPO. We empirically demonstrate the superior performance of
AuxDPO on didactic bandit settings as well as LLM alignment tasks.

Motivation: 现有研究忽视了现实应用中事件标记分布高度不平衡的问题，其中一些标记频繁出现而其他标记很少出现。这种不平衡对下一个事件预测的性能构成了重大挑战，特别是对于罕见标记的事件。

Method: 提出阈值方法学习阈值来调整由标记先验概率归一化的标记概率，以优化标记预测；开发新的神经MTPP模型支持有效时间采样和标记概率估计，无需计算昂贵的数值不当积分；采用先预测标记再预测时间的策略。

Result: 在真实世界数据集上的广泛实验表明，该方法在下一个事件标记和时间预测方面优于各种基线方法。

Conclusion: 所提出的解决方案有效解决了标记分布不平衡问题，在事件预测任务中表现出优越性能。

Abstract: Marked Temporal Point Process (MTPP) has been well studied to model the event
distribution in marked event streams, which can be used to predict the mark and
arrival time of the next event. However, existing studies overlook that the
distribution of event marks is highly imbalanced in many real-world
applications, with some marks being frequent but others rare. The imbalance
poses a significant challenge to the performance of the next event prediction,
especially for events of rare marks. To address this issue, we propose a
thresholding method, which learns thresholds to tune the mark probability
normalized by the mark's prior probability to optimize mark prediction, rather
than predicting the mark directly based on the mark probability as in existing
studies. In conjunction with this method, we predict the mark first and then
the time. In particular, we develop a novel neural MTPP model to support
effective time sampling and estimation of mark probability without
computationally expensive numerical improper integration. Extensive experiments
on real-world datasets demonstrate the superior performance of our solution
against various baselines for the next event mark and time prediction. The code

Motivation: LLM在现实系统中部署时会产生有毒或有偏见的输出，影响安全和信任。参数更新的高成本促使需要选择性使用修复数据，但现有数据选择方法在大型生成模型行为修复中的效果和效率尚不明确。

Method: 评估五种代表性选择方法：随机采样、K-Center、基于梯度范数的选择(GraNd)、分层覆盖(CCS)以及提出的语义感知优先级采样(SAPS)。通过毒性降低、WikiText-2和LAMBADA上的困惑度以及三个复合指标(RPS、OPS、RES)评估修复效果和权衡。

Result: SAPS在解毒、效用保持和效率方面达到最佳平衡，用显著更少的数据提供相当或更好的修复结果。随机采样对大型或鲁棒模型仍然有效，而高开销方法如CCS和GraNd提供的益处有限。最佳数据比例取决于模型规模和修复方法。

Conclusion: 样本选择应被视为修复管道中的可调组件，这些发现确立了基于选择的修复作为维护LLM可靠性的高效可扩展范式。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in real-world systems,
yet they can produce toxic or biased outputs that undermine safety and trust.
Post-hoc model repair provides a practical remedy, but the high cost of
parameter updates motivates selective use of repair data. Despite extensive
prior work on data selection for model training, it remains unclear which
sampling criteria are most effective and efficient when applied specifically to
behavioral repair of large generative models. Our study presents a systematic
analysis of sample prioritization strategies for LLM repair. We evaluate five
representative selection methods, including random sampling, K-Center,
gradient-norm-based selection(GraNd), stratified coverage (CCS), and a
Semantic-Aware Prioritized Sampling (SAPS) approach we proposed. Repair
effectiveness and trade-offs are assessed through toxicity reduction,
perplexity on WikiText-2 and LAMBADA, and three composite metrics: the Repair
Proximity Score (RPS), the Overall Performance Score (OPS), and the Repair
Efficiency Score (RES). Experimental results show that SAPS achieves the best
balance between detoxification, utility preservation, and efficiency,
delivering comparable or superior repair outcomes with substantially less data.
Random sampling remains effective for large or robust models, while
high-overhead methods such as CCS and GraNd provide limited benefit. The
optimal data proportion depends on model scale and repair method, indicating
that sample selection should be regarded as a tunable component of repair
pipelines. Overall, these findings establish selection-based repair as an
efficient and scalable paradigm for maintaining LLM reliability.

Abstract: Evaluating competing systems in a comparable way, i.e., benchmarking them, is
an undeniable pillar of the scientific method. However, system performance is
often summarized via a small number of metrics. The analysis of the evaluation
details and the derivation of insights for further development or use remains a
tedious manual task with often biased results. Thus, this paper argues for a
new type of benchmarking, which is dubbed explainable benchmarking. The aim of
explainable benchmarking approaches is to automatically generate explanations
for the performance of systems in a benchmark. We provide a first instantiation
of this paradigm for knowledge-graph-based question answering systems. We
compute explanations by using a novel concept learning approach developed for
large knowledge graphs called PruneCEL. Our evaluation shows that PruneCEL
outperforms state-of-the-art concept learners on the task of explainable
benchmarking by up to 0.55 points F1 measure. A task-driven user study with 41
participants shows that in 80\% of the cases, the majority of participants can
accurately predict the behavior of a system based on our explanations. Our code

Abstract: Drug combinations offer therapeutic benefits but also carry the risk of
adverse drug-drug interactions (DDIs), especially under complex molecular
structures. Accurate DDI event prediction requires capturing fine-grained
inter-drug relationships, which are critical for modeling metabolic mechanisms
such as enzyme-mediated competition. However, existing approaches typically
rely on isolated drug representations and fail to explicitly model atom-level
cross-molecular interactions, limiting their effectiveness across diverse
molecular complexities and DDI type distributions. To address these
limitations, we propose MolBridge, a novel atom-level joint graph refinement
framework for robust DDI event prediction. MolBridge constructs a joint graph
that integrates atomic structures of drug pairs, enabling direct modeling of
inter-drug associations. A central challenge in such joint graph settings is
the potential loss of information caused by over-smoothing when modeling
long-range atomic dependencies. To overcome this, we introduce a structure
consistency module that iteratively refines node features while preserving the
global structural context. This joint design allows MolBridge to effectively
learn both local and global interaction outperforms state-of-the-art baselines,
achieving superior performance across long-tail and inductive scenarios.
patterns, yielding robust representations across both frequent and rare DDI
types. Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets show that MolBridge
consistently. These results demonstrate the advantages of fine-grained graph
refinement in improving the accuracy, robustness, and mechanistic
interpretability of DDI event prediction.This work contributes to Web Mining
and Content Analysis by developing graph-based methods for mining and analyzing

Abstract: Intransitive player dominance, where player A beats B, B beats C, but C beats
A, is common in competitive tennis. Yet, there are few known attempts to
incorporate it within forecasting methods. We address this problem with a graph
neural network approach that explicitly models these intransitive relationships
through temporal directed graphs, with players as nodes and their historical
match outcomes as directed edges. We find the bookmaker Pinnacle Sports poorly
handles matches with high intransitive complexity and posit that our
graph-based approach is uniquely positioned to capture relational dynamics in
these scenarios. When selectively betting on higher intransitivity matchups
with our model (65.7% accuracy, 0.215 Brier Score), we achieve significant
positive returns of 3.26% ROI with Kelly staking over 1903 bets, suggesting a
market inefficiency in handling intransitive matchups that our approach
successfully exploits.

Motivation: 随着AI生成内容的激增，水印技术对确保内容真实性和归属至关重要。然而，当前研究主要关注水印的抗移除攻击，而水印伪造（从真实内容窃取水印并应用于恶意内容）的研究仍然不足。

Method: 1. 引入偏好模型评估图像是否含水印，使用排序损失在纯程序生成图像上训练，无需真实水印数据；2. 通过反向传播优化输入图像实现水印移除和伪造，仅需单张水印图像且无需水印模型知识。

Result: 在多种后处理图像水印模型上的评估表明，该方法能有效伪造水印，对当前水印方法的安全性提出了质疑。

Conclusion: 该方法简单实用，仅需单张水印图像即可实现水印伪造，揭示了当前水印技术的安全漏洞，为水印安全性研究提供了重要参考。

Abstract: Recent years have seen a surge in interest in digital content watermarking
techniques, driven by the proliferation of generative models and increased
legal pressure. With an ever-growing percentage of AI-generated content
available online, watermarking plays an increasingly important role in ensuring
content authenticity and attribution at scale. There have been many works
assessing the robustness of watermarking to removal attacks, yet, watermark
forging, the scenario when a watermark is stolen from genuine content and
applied to malicious content, remains underexplored. In this work, we
investigate watermark forging in the context of widely used post-hoc image
watermarking. Our contributions are as follows. First, we introduce a
preference model to assess whether an image is watermarked. The model is
trained using a ranking loss on purely procedurally generated images without
any need for real watermarks. Second, we demonstrate the model's capability to
remove and forge watermarks by optimizing the input image through
backpropagation. This technique requires only a single watermarked image and
works without knowledge of the watermarking model, making our attack much
simpler and more practical than attacks introduced in related work. Third, we
evaluate our proposed method on a variety of post-hoc image watermarking
models, demonstrating that our approach can effectively forge watermarks,
questioning the security of current watermarking approaches. Our code and
further resources are publicly available.

TL;DR: 提出Bi-CoG方法，通过同时利用模型间和模型内一致性以及错误感知动态伪标签分配策略，解决半监督微调中的模型偏差和超参数敏感性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的半监督微调方法依赖预测一致性或预定义置信度阈值，容易产生模型偏差和超参数敏感性问题。

Method: Bi-CoG方法结合模型间和模型内一致性，采用错误感知动态伪标签分配策略来生成高质量、低偏差的伪标签。

Result: 在14个数据集上的广泛实验表明，Bi-CoG能持续显著提升现有方法的性能。

Conclusion: Bi-CoG是一种简单有效的即插即用方法，通过双一致性引导和动态伪标签分配，有效解决了半监督微调中的关键问题。

Abstract: Exploiting unlabeled data through semi-supervised learning (SSL) or
leveraging pre-trained models via fine-tuning are two prevailing paradigms for
addressing label-scarce scenarios. Recently, growing attention has been given
to combining fine-tuning of pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs) with SSL,
forming the emerging paradigm of semi-supervised fine-tuning. However, existing
methods often suffer from model bias and hyperparameter sensitivity, due to
reliance on prediction consistency or pre-defined confidence thresholds. To
address these limitations, we propose a simple yet effective plug-and-play
methodology named
$\underline{\textbf{Bi-Co}}$nsistency-$\underline{\textbf{G}}$uided
Self-Training (Bi-CoG), which assigns high-quality and low-bias pseudo-labels,
by simultaneously exploiting inter-model and intra-model consistency, along
with an error-aware dynamic pseudo-label assignment strategy. Both theoretical
analysis and extensive experiments over 14 datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness of Bi-CoG, which consistently and significantly improves the
performance of existing methods.

*Fangjian Zhang,Xiaoyong Zhuge,Wenlan Wang,Haixia Xiao,Yuying Zhu,Siyang Cheng*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出Hurdle-IMDL框架解决遥感降雨反演中的标签不平衡问题，通过分解零膨胀和长尾分布，分别用hurdle模型和逆模型去偏学习来处理，显著提高了强降雨的检索性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人工智能在定量遥感中面临标签分布不平衡的限制，传统训练模型偏向常见样本，导致对罕见样本（如强降雨）的检索性能下降。

Method: 采用分而治之策略：1）用hurdle模型处理零膨胀（非降雨样本占主导）；2）提出IMDL方法处理长尾分布（轻降雨样本过多），将学习目标转化为无偏理想逆模型。

Result: 通过统计指标和案例研究验证，Hurdle-IMDL优于传统方法、代价敏感学习、生成方法和多任务学习方法，有效缓解系统低估，显著改善强到极端降雨的检索。

Conclusion: IMDL为处理环境变量分布不平衡提供了通用方法，能够增强对罕见但高影响事件的检索能力。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence has advanced quantitative remote sensing, yet its
effectiveness is constrained by imbalanced label distribution. This imbalance
leads conventionally trained models to favor common samples, which in turn
degrades retrieval performance for rare ones. Rainfall retrieval exemplifies
this issue, with performance particularly compromised for heavy rain. This
study proposes Hurdle-Inversion Model Debiasing Learning (IMDL) framework.
Following a divide-and-conquer strategy, imbalance in the rain distribution is
decomposed into two components: zero inflation, defined by the predominance of
non-rain samples; and long tail, defined by the disproportionate abundance of
light-rain samples relative to heavy-rain samples. A hurdle model is adopted to
handle the zero inflation, while IMDL is proposed to address the long tail by
transforming the learning object into an unbiased ideal inverse model.
Comprehensive evaluation via statistical metrics and case studies investigating
rainy weather in eastern China confirms Hurdle-IMDL's superiority over
conventional, cost-sensitive, generative, and multi-task learning methods. Its
key advancements include effective mitigation of systematic underestimation and
a marked improvement in the retrieval of heavy-to-extreme rain. IMDL offers a
generalizable approach for addressing imbalance in distributions of
environmental variables, enabling enhanced retrieval of rare yet high-impact
events.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SheafAlign是一个基于层论的去中心化多模态对齐框架，通过多个比较空间替代单空间对齐，解决了传统方法需要所有模态相互冗余的假设问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统多模态对齐方法假设所有模态之间相互冗余，这在现实分布式场景中不成立。需要一种能够处理非完全冗余模态的对齐方法。

Method: 使用层结构建模成对模态关系，采用去中心化对比学习目标进行训练，通过多个比较空间实现对齐。

Result: 在多模态传感数据集上表现出优越的零样本泛化能力、跨模态对齐性能和模态缺失鲁棒性，通信成本比最先进基线降低50%。

Conclusion: SheafAlign框架有效克服了传统方法的局限性，无需所有模态相互冗余，同时保留了共享和独特信息，在分布式场景中具有显著优势。

Abstract: Conventional multimodal alignment methods assume mutual redundancy across all
modalities, an assumption that fails in real-world distributed scenarios. We
propose SheafAlign, a sheaf-theoretic framework for decentralized multimodal
alignment that replaces single-space alignment with multiple comparison spaces.
This approach models pairwise modality relations through sheaf structures and
leverages decentralized contrastive learning-based objectives for training.
SheafAlign overcomes the limitations of prior methods by not requiring mutual
redundancy among all modalities, preserving both shared and unique information.
Experiments on multimodal sensing datasets show superior zero-shot
generalization, cross-modal alignment, and robustness to missing modalities,
with 50\% lower communication cost than state-of-the-art baselines.

Abstract: Zero-shot reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a setting for developing
general agents in an unsupervised manner, capable of solving downstream tasks
without additional training or planning at test-time. Unlike conventional RL,
which optimizes policies for a fixed reward, zero-shot RL requires agents to
encode representations rich enough to support immediate adaptation to any
objective, drawing parallels to vision and language foundation models. Despite
growing interest, the field lacks a common analytical lens.
  We present the first unified framework for zero-shot RL. Our formulation
introduces a consistent notation and taxonomy that organizes existing
approaches and allows direct comparison between them. Central to our framework
is the classification of algorithms into two families: direct representations,
which learn end-to-end mappings from rewards to policies, and compositional
representations, which decompose the representation leveraging the substructure
of the value function. Within this framework, we highlight shared principles
and key differences across methods, and we derive an extended bound for
successor-feature methods, offering a new perspective on their performance in
the zero-shot regime. By consolidating existing work under a common lens, our
framework provides a principled foundation for future research in zero-shot RL
and outlines a clear path toward developing more general agents.

Motivation: 图重布线技术虽然能缓解图神经网络中的过度压缩问题，但会改变图拓扑结构，可能扭曲重要的拓扑依赖信号。目前缺乏对哪些结构属性必须保留以确保性能提升和结构保真度的系统研究。

Method: 研究七种不同的重布线策略，并分析局部和全局图属性变化与节点分类准确率之间的相关性。

Result: 结果显示一致模式：成功的重布线方法倾向于保留局部结构，同时允许全局连接的灵活性。

Conclusion: 这些发现为设计有效的重布线策略提供了新见解，弥合了图理论与实际GNN优化之间的差距。

Abstract: Graph rewiring has emerged as a key technique to alleviate over-squashing in
Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and Graph Transformers by modifying the graph
topology to improve information flow. While effective, rewiring inherently
alters the graph's structure, raising the risk of distorting important
topology-dependent signals. Yet, despite the growing use of rewiring, little is
known about which structural properties must be preserved to ensure both
performance gains and structural fidelity. In this work, we provide the first
systematic analysis of how rewiring affects a range of graph structural
metrics, and how these changes relate to downstream task performance. We study
seven diverse rewiring strategies and correlate changes in local and global
graph properties with node classification accuracy. Our results reveal a
consistent pattern: successful rewiring methods tend to preserve local
structure while allowing for flexibility in global connectivity. These findings
offer new insights into the design of effective rewiring strategies, bridging
the gap between graph theory and practical GNN optimization.

Method: 评估RAMI 4.0和ISA-95标准对MLOps的适用性，提出将MLOps生命周期组件映射到RAMI 4.0的系统方法，并通过真实用例进行验证。

Result: 研究发现标准MLOps实践不能直接移植到OT环境，但通过使用现有参考模型进行结构化适配，可以提供成功的集成路径。

Abstract: Machine Learning Operations (MLOps) practices are increas- ingly adopted in
industrial settings, yet their integration with Opera- tional Technology (OT)
systems presents significant challenges. This pa- per analyzes the fundamental
obstacles in combining MLOps with OT en- vironments and proposes a systematic
approach to embed MLOps prac- tices into established OT reference models. We
evaluate the suitability of the Reference Architectural Model for Industry 4.0

MLOps integration and present a detailed mapping of MLOps lifecycle compo-
nents to RAMI 4.0 exemplified by a real-world use case. Our findings
demonstrate that while standard MLOps practices cannot be directly transplanted
to OT environments, structured adaptation using existing reference models can
provide a pathway for successful integration.

Result: 在多种推理问题上超越现有最先进方法，能够泛化到更大更复杂的问题。

Conclusion: 组合式能量景观方法有效提升了推理模型的泛化能力，为复杂推理任务提供了新思路。

Abstract: Generalization is a key challenge in machine learning, specifically in
reasoning tasks, where models are expected to solve problems more complex than
those encountered during training. Existing approaches typically train
reasoning models in an end-to-end fashion, directly mapping input instances to
solutions. While this allows models to learn useful heuristics from data, it
often results in limited generalization beyond the training distribution. In
this work, we propose a novel approach to reasoning generalization by learning
energy landscapes over the solution spaces of smaller, more tractable
subproblems. At test time, we construct a global energy landscape for a given
problem by combining the energy functions of multiple subproblems. This
compositional approach enables the incorporation of additional constraints
during inference, allowing the construction of energy landscapes for problems
of increasing difficulty. To improve the sample quality from this newly
constructed energy landscape, we introduce Parallel Energy Minimization (PEM).
We evaluate our approach on a wide set of reasoning problems. Our method
outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating its ability to
generalize to larger and more complex problems. Project website can be found

TL;DR: 本文对随机梯度下降(SGD)在期望平滑性(ES)条件下的收敛性进行了系统分析，改进了ES条件的解释和采样相关常数，推导了全梯度范数平方期望的界，并证明了不同步长策略下的O(1/K)收敛速率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 经典SGD分析依赖于过强(有界方差)或过粗糙(均匀噪声)的假设，期望平滑性条件作为灵活替代方案，将随机梯度的二阶矩与目标函数值和全梯度联系起来。

Method: 采用期望平滑性(ES)条件作为分析框架，通过精炼ES条件的解释和采样相关常数，推导全梯度范数平方期望的界，并分析不同步长策略下的收敛行为。

Result: 证明了SGD在ES条件下具有O(1/K)的收敛速率，并给出了显式的残差误差表达式，统一并扩展了近期相关研究。

Conclusion: 期望平滑性条件为SGD收敛分析提供了更灵活和实用的理论框架，本文的分析方法统一并推进了该领域的研究进展。

Abstract: Stochastic gradient descent (SGD) is the workhorse of large-scale learning,
yet classical analyses rely on assumptions that can be either too strong
(bounded variance) or too coarse (uniform noise). The expected smoothness (ES)
condition has emerged as a flexible alternative that ties the second moment of
stochastic gradients to the objective value and the full gradient. This paper
presents a self-contained convergence analysis of SGD under ES. We (i) refine
ES with interpretations and sampling-dependent constants; (ii) derive bounds of
the expectation of squared full gradient norm; and (iii) prove $O(1/K)$ rates
with explicit residual errors for various step-size schedules. All proofs are
given in full detail in the appendix. Our treatment unifies and extends recent
threads (Khaled and Richt\'arik, 2020; Umeda and Iiduka, 2025).

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文系统研究了代码生成任务中的检索设计，发现在不同计算预算下，PL-PL任务中稀疏BM25加词级分割效果最佳，而NL-PL任务中密集编码器表现更好但延迟高。最佳块大小随上下文窗口变化，简单行分割与语法感知分割效果相当，检索延迟差异可达200倍。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究在现实计算预算下代码生成任务的检索设计，为构建有效的代码导向RAG系统提供基于证据的建议。

Method: 使用Long Code Arena中的代码补全和bug定位任务，系统比较不同上下文窗口大小下的检索配置，包括分块策略、相似性评分和分割粒度三个维度。

Result: PL-PL任务中稀疏BM25加词级分割最有效且实用；NL-PL任务中密集编码器表现更好但延迟高100倍；最佳块大小随上下文窗口变化；行分割与语法感知分割效果相当；检索延迟差异可达200倍。

Conclusion: 为代码导向RAG系统提供了基于任务需求、模型约束和计算效率的证据性建议，BM25加词级分割在质量-延迟权衡中表现最佳。

Abstract: We study retrieval design for code-focused generation tasks under realistic
compute budgets. Using two complementary tasks from Long Code Arena -- code
completion and bug localization -- we systematically compare retrieval
configurations across various context window sizes along three axes: (i)
chunking strategy, (ii) similarity scoring, and (iii) splitting granularity.
(1) For PL-PL, sparse BM25 with word-level splitting is the most effective and
practical, significantly outperforming dense alternatives while being an order
of magnitude faster. (2) For NL-PL, proprietary dense encoders (Voyager-3
family) consistently beat sparse retrievers, however requiring 100x larger
latency. (3) Optimal chunk size scales with available context: 32-64 line
chunks work best at small budgets, and whole-file retrieval becomes competitive
at 16000 tokens. (4) Simple line-based chunking matches syntax-aware splitting
across budgets. (5) Retrieval latency varies by up to 200x across
configurations; BPE-based splitting is needlessly slow, and BM25 + word
splitting offers the best quality-latency trade-off. Thus, we provide
evidence-based recommendations for implementing effective code-oriented RAG
systems based on task requirements, model constraints, and computational
efficiency.

Abstract: Breast cancer is considered the most critical and frequently diagnosed cancer
in women worldwide, leading to an increase in cancer-related mortality. Early
and accurate detection is crucial as it can help mitigate possible threats
while improving survival rates. In terms of prediction, conventional diagnostic
methods are often limited by variability, cost, and, most importantly, risk of
misdiagnosis. To address these challenges, machine learning (ML) has emerged as
a powerful tool for computer-aided diagnosis, with feature selection playing a
vital role in improving model performance and interpretability. This research
study proposes an integrated framework that incorporates customized Particle
Swarm Optimization (PSO) for feature selection. This framework has been
evaluated on a comprehensive set of 29 different models, spanning classical
classifiers, ensemble techniques, neural networks, probabilistic algorithms,
and instance-based algorithms. To ensure interpretability and clinical
relevance, the study uses cross-validation in conjunction with explainable AI
methods. Experimental evaluation showed that the proposed approach achieved a
superior score of 99.1\% across all performance metrics, including accuracy and
precision, while effectively reducing dimensionality and providing transparent,
model-agnostic explanations. The results highlight the potential of combining
swarm intelligence with explainable ML for robust, trustworthy, and clinically
meaningful breast cancer diagnosis.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 质谱在分子识别中至关重要，但由于标注谱图稀缺，从质谱数据解析结构仍然困难。大规模预训练在其他领域有效，但质谱信号的复杂性和异质性阻碍了该范式应用。

Method: 提出MS-BART框架，将质谱和分子结构映射到共享词汇表，通过大规模预训练进行跨模态学习。使用多任务预训练目标（去噪和翻译），并通过MIST生成的指纹预测对实验谱图进行微调，引入化学反馈机制减少分子幻觉。

Conclusion: MS-BART通过统一建模和大规模预训练有效解决了质谱数据稀缺问题，在分子结构解析任务中表现出色，为质谱分析提供了强大的新工具。

Abstract: Mass spectrometry (MS) plays a critical role in molecular identification,
significantly advancing scientific discovery. However, structure elucidation
from MS data remains challenging due to the scarcity of annotated spectra.
While large-scale pretraining has proven effective in addressing data scarcity
in other domains, applying this paradigm to mass spectrometry is hindered by
the complexity and heterogeneity of raw spectral signals. To address this, we
propose MS-BART, a unified modeling framework that maps mass spectra and
molecular structures into a shared token vocabulary, enabling cross-modal
learning through large-scale pretraining on reliably computed
fingerprint-molecule datasets. Multi-task pretraining objectives further
enhance MS-BART's generalization by jointly optimizing denoising and
translation task. The pretrained model is subsequently transferred to
experimental spectra through finetuning on fingerprint predictions generated
with MIST, a pre-trained spectral inference model, thereby enhancing robustness
to real-world spectral variability. While finetuning alleviates the
distributional difference, MS-BART still suffers molecular hallucination and
requires further alignment. We therefore introduce a chemical feedback
mechanism that guides the model toward generating molecules closer to the
reference structure. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that MS-BART achieves
SOTA performance across 5/12 key metrics on MassSpecGym and NPLIB1 and is
faster by one order of magnitude than competing diffusion-based methods, while
comprehensive ablation studies systematically validate the model's
effectiveness and robustness.

TL;DR: 论文分析了差分隐私迁移学习中的两个关键超参数：裁剪边界C和批量大小B。研究发现当前理论（强隐私需要更小的C）与实证结果（强隐私下更大的C表现更好）存在不匹配，并揭示了现有批量大小调优启发式方法无效，而累积DP噪声能更好解释批量大小选择。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前差分隐私迁移学习实践中，关于如何选择最优裁剪边界C和批量大小B的理论理解与实证结果存在矛盾，且现有调优方法在不同任务和隐私约束下表现不佳，需要更深入的分析来指导超参数选择。

Method: 通过分析梯度分布变化、将裁剪视为梯度重加权形式、以及考察累积DP噪声的影响，来研究C和B在不同隐私约束和计算预算下的最优选择策略。

Result: 发现强隐私约束下，更大的裁剪边界C反而表现更好；在固定计算预算下，现有批量大小调优启发式方法无效，而累积DP噪声能决定批量大小选择；单一(C,B)设置在不同任务间会导致次优性能。

Conclusion: 差分隐私迁移学习的超参数选择需要更细致的分析，应考虑梯度分布变化、裁剪的梯度重加权效应和累积DP噪声，而不是依赖单一设置或简单启发式方法。

Abstract: Differentially private (DP) transfer learning, i.e., fine-tuning a pretrained
model on private data, is the current state-of-the-art approach for training
large models under privacy constraints. We focus on two key hyperparameters in
this setting: the clipping bound $C$ and batch size $B$. We show a clear
mismatch between the current theoretical understanding of how to choose an
optimal $C$ (stronger privacy requires smaller $C$) and empirical outcomes
(larger $C$ performs better under strong privacy), caused by changes in the
gradient distributions. Assuming a limited compute budget (fixed epochs), we
demonstrate that the existing heuristics for tuning $B$ do not work, while
cumulative DP noise better explains whether smaller or larger batches perform
better. We also highlight how the common practice of using a single $(C,B)$
setting across tasks can lead to suboptimal performance. We find that
performance drops especially when moving between loose and tight privacy and
between plentiful and limited compute, which we explain by analyzing clipping
as a form of gradient re-weighting and examining cumulative DP noise.

TL;DR: H-SPLID是一种通过将显著和非显著特征显式分解到不同空间来学习显著特征表示的新算法，能够促进学习低维任务相关特征并增强模型鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法往往难以明确区分输入中的显著和非显著特征，这可能导致模型学习到与任务无关的冗余特征，影响模型的鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Method: 提出H-SPLID算法，通过显式地将显著和非显著特征分解到不同的表示空间，利用Hilbert-Schmidt独立性准则(HSIC)来约束表示与输入之间的依赖关系。

Result: 理论证明输入扰动下的预期预测偏差受显著子空间维度和HSIC值的上界约束。实验表明H-SPLID训练的模型主要依赖显著输入成分，对影响非显著特征（如图像背景）的扰动敏感性降低。

Conclusion: H-SPLID建立了鲁棒性与潜在表示压缩之间的联系，通过显式特征分解实现了更鲁棒和任务相关的特征学习。

Abstract: We introduce H-SPLID, a novel algorithm for learning salient feature
representations through the explicit decomposition of salient and non-salient
features into separate spaces. We show that H-SPLID promotes learning
low-dimensional, task-relevant features. We prove that the expected prediction
deviation under input perturbations is upper-bounded by the dimension of the
salient subspace and the Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion (HSIC) between
inputs and representations. This establishes a link between robustness and
latent representation compression in terms of the dimensionality and
information preserved. Empirical evaluations on image classification tasks show
that models trained with H-SPLID primarily rely on salient input components, as
indicated by reduced sensitivity to perturbations affecting non-salient
features, such as image backgrounds. Our code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机器学习模型在医疗保健中的应用日益增多，但临床数据中的结构性不平等和社会偏见可能被数据驱动模型延续甚至放大。在生存分析中，删失和时间动态性进一步增加了公平模型开发的复杂性。

Method: 提出了公平感知生存建模(FASM)方法，专门设计用于减轻关于组内和跨组风险排序的算法偏见。以乳腺癌预后为代表性案例，应用于SEER乳腺癌数据。

Result: FASM显著提高了公平性，同时保持了与不考虑公平性的生存模型相当的判别性能。时间分层评估显示FASM在10年时间范围内保持稳定的公平性，在随访中期观察到最大的改进。

Conclusion: 该方法使得生存模型能够在临床决策中同时优先考虑准确性和公平性，将公平性作为临床护理的核心原则推进。

Abstract: As machine learning models become increasingly integrated into healthcare,
structural inequities and social biases embedded in clinical data can be
perpetuated or even amplified by data-driven models. In survival analysis,
censoring and time dynamics can further add complexity to fair model
development. Additionally, algorithmic fairness approaches often overlook
disparities in cross-group rankings, e.g., high-risk Black patients may be
ranked below lower-risk White patients who do not experience the event of
mortality. Such misranking can reinforce biological essentialism and undermine
equitable care. We propose a Fairness-Aware Survival Modeling (FASM), designed
to mitigate algorithmic bias regarding both intra-group and cross-group risk
rankings over time. Using breast cancer prognosis as a representative case and
applying FASM to SEER breast cancer data, we show that FASM substantially
improves fairness while preserving discrimination performance comparable to
fairness-unaware survival models. Time-stratified evaluations show that FASM
maintains stable fairness over a 10-year horizon, with the greatest
improvements observed during the mid-term of follow-up. Our approach enables
the development of survival models that prioritize both accuracy and equity in
clinical decision-making, advancing fairness as a core principle in clinical
care.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) and large multimodal models (LMMs) have achieved
unprecedented breakthrough, showcasing remarkable capabilities in natural
language understanding, generation, and complex reasoning. This transformative
potential has positioned them as key enablers for 6G autonomous communications
among machines, vehicles, and humanoids. In this article, we provide an
overview of task-oriented autonomous communications with LLMs/LMMs, focusing on
multimodal sensing integration, adaptive reconfiguration, and
prompt/fine-tuning strategies for wireless tasks. We demonstrate the framework
through three case studies: LMM-based traffic control, LLM-based robot
scheduling, and LMM-based environment-aware channel estimation. From
experimental results, we show that the proposed LLM/LMM-aided autonomous
systems significantly outperform conventional and discriminative deep learning
(DL) model-based techniques, maintaining robustness under dynamic objectives,
varying input parameters, and heterogeneous multimodal conditions where
conventional static optimization degrades.

Abstract: In this paper, we present DiRecGNN, an attention-enhanced entity
recommendation framework for monitoring cloud services at Microsoft. We provide
insights on the usefulness of this feature as perceived by the cloud service
owners and lessons learned from deployment. Specifically, we introduce the
problem of recommending the optimal subset of attributes (dimensions) that
should be tracked by an automated watchdog (monitor) for cloud services. To
begin, we construct the monitor heterogeneous graph at production-scale. The
interaction dynamics of these entities are often characterized by limited
structural and engagement information, resulting in inferior performance of
state-of-the-art approaches. Moreover, traditional methods fail to capture the
dependencies between entities spanning a long range due to their homophilic
nature. Therefore, we propose an attention-enhanced entity ranking model
inspired by transformer architectures. Our model utilizes a multi-head
attention mechanism to focus on heterogeneous neighbors and their attributes,
and further attends to paths sampled using random walks to capture long-range
dependencies. We also employ multi-faceted loss functions to optimize for
relevant recommendations while respecting the inherent sparsity of the data.
Empirical evaluations demonstrate significant improvements over existing
methods, with our model achieving a 43.1% increase in MRR. Furthermore, product
teams who consumed these features perceive the feature as useful and rated it
4.5 out of 5.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 互信息是表示学习中的基本统计依赖度量，但直接优化往往难以处理。许多方法转而最大化替代依赖度量如JSD，但这些替代目标与互信息的关系尚不明确，需要建立理论联系。

Method: 推导了KLD作为JSD函数的新的紧致下界，通过二元分类器的交叉熵损失实现JSD的变分下界，并在各种基准场景中与最先进的神经估计器进行比较。

Result: 实验表明该下界在互信息估计中紧致，提供了稳定、低方差的互信息下界估计，在信息瓶颈框架中也显示出实用价值。

Conclusion: 研究结果为基于判别学习的互信息表示学习提供了新的理论依据和强有力经验证据，证明了最大化JSD确实能保证增加互信息的下界。

Abstract: Mutual Information (MI) is a fundamental measure of statistical dependence
widely used in representation learning. While direct optimization of MI via its
definition as a Kullback-Leibler divergence (KLD) is often intractable, many
recent methods have instead maximized alternative dependence measures, most
notably, the Jensen-Shannon divergence (JSD) between joint and product of
marginal distributions via discriminative losses. However, the connection
between these surrogate objectives and MI remains poorly understood. In this
work, we bridge this gap by deriving a new, tight, and tractable lower bound on
KLD as a function of JSD in the general case. By specializing this bound to
joint and marginal distributions, we demonstrate that maximizing the JSD-based
information increases a guaranteed lower bound on mutual information.
Furthermore, we revisit the practical implementation of JSD-based objectives
and observe that minimizing the cross-entropy loss of a binary classifier
trained to distinguish joint from marginal pairs recovers a known variational
lower bound on the JSD. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our lower bound
is tight when applied to MI estimation. We compared our lower bound to
state-of-the-art neural estimators of variational lower bound across a range of
established reference scenarios. Our lower bound estimator consistently
provides a stable, low-variance estimate of a tight lower bound on MI. We also
demonstrate its practical usefulness in the context of the Information
Bottleneck framework. Taken together, our results provide new theoretical
justifications and strong empirical evidence for using discriminative learning
in MI-based representation learning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界时间序列中的极端事件（如洪水、热浪、医疗紧急事件）具有重要实际意义，但现有模型因数据不平衡和忽视中间事件信息而难以准确预测。

Method: 使用知识蒸馏从低稀有性事件模型中转移信息，并引入专家混合机制动态选择和融合不同稀有级别的专家模型输出。

Result: 在多个数据集上的实验显示，xTime对极端事件的预测准确率从3%提升到78%。

Conclusion: xTime框架通过知识蒸馏和专家混合机制有效解决了极端事件预测的挑战，显著提升了预测性能。

Abstract: Extreme events frequently occur in real-world time series and often carry
significant practical implications. In domains such as climate and healthcare,
these events, such as floods, heatwaves, or acute medical episodes, can lead to
serious consequences. Accurate forecasting of such events is therefore of
substantial importance. Most existing time series forecasting models are
optimized for overall performance within the prediction window, but often
struggle to accurately predict extreme events, such as high temperatures or
heart rate spikes. The main challenges are data imbalance and the neglect of
valuable information contained in intermediate events that precede extreme
events. In this paper, we propose xTime, a novel framework for extreme event
forecasting in time series. xTime leverages knowledge distillation to transfer
information from models trained on lower-rarity events, thereby improving
prediction performance on rarer ones. In addition, we introduce a mixture of
experts (MoE) mechanism that dynamically selects and fuses outputs from expert
models across different rarity levels, which further improves the forecasting
performance for extreme events. Experiments on multiple datasets show that
xTime achieves consistent improvements, with forecasting accuracy on extreme
events improving from 3% to 78%.

Motivation: GNSS信号在城市环境中易受干扰，现有数据驱动方法定位效果尚可但信号强度场重建较差，主要受限于空间上下文信息不足。

Method: 混合贝叶斯专家混合框架，融合物理路径损耗模型（保证物理一致性）和CNN（利用建筑高度图捕捉城市传播效应），通过对数线性池化结合，使用拉普拉斯近似进行贝叶斯推断。

Result: 在城市射线追踪数据上的实验表明，随着训练点增加，定位精度提高且不确定性降低，不确定性主要集中在干扰源附近和城市峡谷等传播敏感区域。

Conclusion: 所提出的混合框架能够有效提升GNSS干扰源定位精度并重建信号强度场，同时提供后验不确定性估计，特别适用于复杂的城市环境。

Abstract: Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) signals are vulnerable to jamming,
particularly in urban areas where multipath and shadowing distort received
power. Previous data-driven approaches achieved reasonable localization but
poorly reconstructed the received signal strength (RSS) field due to limited
spatial context. We propose a hybrid Bayesian mixture-of-experts framework that
fuses a physical path-loss (PL) model and a convolutional neural network (CNN)
through log-linear pooling. The PL expert ensures physical consistency, while
the CNN leverages building-height maps to capture urban propagation effects.
Bayesian inference with Laplace approximation provides posterior uncertainty
over both the jammer position and RSS field. Experiments on urban ray-tracing
data show that localization accuracy improves and uncertainty decreases with
more training points, while uncertainty concentrates near the jammer and along
urban canyons where propagation is most sensitive.

Abstract: This is not a typical survey of world models; it is a guide for those who
want to build worlds. We do not aim to catalog every paper that has ever
mentioned a ``world model". Instead, we follow one clear road: from early
masked models that unified representation learning across modalities, to
unified architectures that share a single paradigm, then to interactive
generative models that close the action-perception loop, and finally to
memory-augmented systems that sustain consistent worlds over time. We bypass
loosely related branches to focus on the core: the generative heart, the
interactive loop, and the memory system. We show that this is the most
promising path towards true world models.

Abstract: Determining the appropriate locus of care for addiction patients is one of
the most critical clinical decisions that affects patient treatment outcomes
and effective use of resources. With a lack of sufficient specialized treatment
resources, such as inpatient beds or staff, there is an unmet need to develop
an automated framework for the same. Current decision-making approaches suffer
from severe class imbalances in addiction datasets. To address this limitation,
we propose a novel graph neural network (GRACE) framework that formalizes locus
of care prediction as a structured learning problem. Further, we perform
extensive feature engineering and propose a new approach of obtaining an
unbiased meta-graph to train a GNN to overcome the class imbalance problem.
Experimental results in real-world data show an improvement of 11-35% in terms
of the F1 score of the minority class over competitive baselines. The codes and

TL;DR: Spikachu是一个基于脉冲神经网络(SNN)的可扩展、因果性和高能效的神经解码框架，在非人类灵长类动物的神经记录数据上表现优于因果基线模型，同时能耗降低2.26-418.81倍。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于学习的神经解码方法存在两极化问题：简单因果模型缺乏泛化能力，复杂非因果模型虽然能泛化但难以实时应用。两者都依赖高能耗的人工神经网络，难以集成到资源受限的现实系统中。

Method: 提出Spikachu框架，直接处理分箱的脉冲信号，将其投影到共享潜在空间，通过适应输入时序的脉冲模块提取相关特征，然后整合这些潜在表示并解码生成行为预测。

Result: 在6只非人类灵长类动物的113个记录会话（总计43小时记录）上评估，该方法在单会话训练中优于因果基线，能耗降低2.26-418.81倍。多会话和跨被试训练能进一步提升性能，并实现对新会话、新被试和新任务的少样本迁移。

Conclusion: Spikachu引入了一个基于SNN的可扩展、在线兼容的神经解码框架，其性能与最先进模型相当，同时能耗降低数个数量级。

Abstract: Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) promise to enable vital functions, such as
speech and prosthetic control, for individuals with neuromotor impairments.
Central to their success are neural decoders, models that map neural activity
to intended behavior. Current learning-based decoding approaches fall into two
classes: simple, causal models that lack generalization, or complex, non-causal
models that generalize and scale offline but struggle in real-time settings.
Both face a common challenge, their reliance on power-hungry artificial neural
network backbones, which makes integration into real-world, resource-limited
systems difficult. Spiking neural networks (SNNs) offer a promising
alternative. Because they operate causally these models are suitable for
real-time use, and their low energy demands make them ideal for
battery-constrained environments. To this end, we introduce Spikachu: a
scalable, causal, and energy-efficient neural decoding framework based on SNNs.
Our approach processes binned spikes directly by projecting them into a shared
latent space, where spiking modules, adapted to the timing of the input,
extract relevant features; these latent representations are then integrated and
decoded to generate behavioral predictions. We evaluate our approach on 113
recording sessions from 6 non-human primates, totaling 43 hours of recordings.
Our method outperforms causal baselines when trained on single sessions using
between 2.26 and 418.81 times less energy. Furthermore, we demonstrate that
scaling up training to multiple sessions and subjects improves performance and
enables few-shot transfer to unseen sessions, subjects, and tasks. Overall,
Spikachu introduces a scalable, online-compatible neural decoding framework
based on SNNs, whose performance is competitive relative to state-of-the-art
models while consuming orders of magnitude less energy.

Abstract: The ability to continually learn, retain and deploy skills to accomplish
goals is a key feature of intelligent and efficient behavior. However, the
neural mechanisms facilitating the continual learning and flexible
(re-)composition of skills remain elusive. Here, we study continual learning
and the compositional reuse of learned computations in recurrent neural network
(RNN) models using a novel two-system approach: one system that infers what
computation to perform, and one that implements how to perform it. We focus on
a set of compositional cognitive tasks commonly studied in neuroscience. To
construct the what system, we first show that a large family of tasks can be
systematically described by a probabilistic generative model, where
compositionality stems from a shared underlying vocabulary of discrete task
epochs. The shared epoch structure makes these tasks inherently compositional.
We first show that this compositionality can be systematically described by a
probabilistic generative model. Furthermore, We develop an unsupervised online
learning approach that can learn this model on a single-trial basis, building
its vocabulary incrementally as it is exposed to new tasks, and inferring the
latent epoch structure as a time-varying computational context within a trial.
We implement the how system as an RNN whose low-rank components are composed
according to the context inferred by the what system. Contextual inference
facilitates the creation, learning, and reuse of low-rank RNN components as new
tasks are introduced sequentially, enabling continual learning without
catastrophic forgetting. Using an example task set, we demonstrate the efficacy
and competitive performance of this two-system learning framework, its
potential for forward and backward transfer, as well as fast compositional
generalization to unseen tasks.

Motivation: 现有约翰霍普金斯跌倒风险评估工具(JHFRAT)需要与更多临床有意义指标更好地对齐，以改进住院患者跌倒风险预测和预防协议。

Method: 对54,209例住院患者进行回顾性分析，使用约束评分优化(CSO)模型结合JHFRAT评估数据和电子健康记录变量，并与XGBoost黑盒模型进行比较。

Conclusion: 这种基于证据的方法为医疗系统提供了坚实基础，可利用数据驱动优化技术系统性地增强住院患者跌倒预防协议和患者安全，改善风险评估和资源分配。

Abstract: In this study we aim to better align fall risk prediction from the Johns
Hopkins Fall Risk Assessment Tool (JHFRAT) with additional clinically
meaningful measures via a data-driven modelling approach. We conducted a
retrospective analysis of 54,209 inpatient admissions from three Johns Hopkins
Health System hospitals between March 2022 and October 2023. A total of 20,208
admissions were included as high fall risk encounters, and 13,941 were included
as low fall risk encounters. To incorporate clinical knowledge and maintain
interpretability, we employed constrained score optimization (CSO) models on
JHFRAT assessment data and additional electronic health record (EHR) variables.
The model demonstrated significant improvements in predictive performance over
the current JHFRAT (CSO AUC-ROC=0.91, JHFRAT AUC-ROC=0.86). The constrained
score optimization models performed similarly with and without the EHR
variables. Although the benchmark black-box model (XGBoost), improves upon the
performance metrics of the knowledge-based constrained logistic regression
(AUC-ROC=0.94), the CSO demonstrates more robustness to variations in risk
labelling. This evidence-based approach provides a robust foundation for health
systems to systematically enhance inpatient fall prevention protocols and
patient safety using data-driven optimization techniques, contributing to
improved risk assessment and resource allocation in healthcare settings.

Abstract: Semiconductor manufacturing is an extremely complex and precision-driven
process, characterized by thousands of interdependent parameters collected
across diverse tools and process steps. Multi-variate time-series analysis has
emerged as a critical field for real-time monitoring and fault detection in
such environments. However, anomaly prediction in semiconductor fabrication
presents several critical challenges, including high dimensionality of sensor
data and severe class imbalance due to the rarity of true faults. Furthermore,
the complex interdependencies between variables complicate both anomaly
prediction and root-cause-analysis. This paper proposes two novel approaches to
advance the field from anomaly detection to anomaly prediction, an essential
step toward enabling real-time process correction and proactive fault
prevention. The proposed anomaly prediction framework contains two main stages:
(a) training a forecasting model on a dataset assumed to contain no anomalies,
and (b) performing forecast on unseen time series data. The forecast is
compared with the forecast of the trained signal. Deviations beyond a
predefined threshold are flagged as anomalies. The two approaches differ in the
forecasting model employed. The first assumes independence between variables by
utilizing the N-BEATS model for univariate time series forecasting. The second
lifts this assumption by utilizing a Graph Neural Network (GNN) to capture
inter-variable relationships. Both models demonstrate strong forecasting
performance up to a horizon of 20 time points and maintain stable anomaly
prediction up to 50 time points. The GNN consistently outperforms the N-BEATS
model while requiring significantly fewer trainable parameters and lower
computational cost. These results position the GNN as promising solution for
online anomaly forecasting to be deployed in manufacturing environments.

Abstract: Thompson sampling (TS) is a powerful and widely used strategy for sequential
decision-making, with applications ranging from Bayesian optimization to
reinforcement learning (RL). Despite its success, the theoretical foundations
of TS remain limited, particularly in settings with complex temporal structure
such as RL. We address this gap by establishing no-regret guarantees for TS
using models with Gaussian marginal distributions. Specifically, we consider TS
in episodic RL with joint Gaussian process (GP) priors over rewards and
transitions. We prove a regret bound of
$\mathcal{\tilde{O}}(\sqrt{KH\Gamma(KH)})$ over $K$ episodes of horizon $H$,
where $\Gamma(\cdot)$ captures the complexity of the GP model. Our analysis
addresses several challenges, including the non-Gaussian nature of value
functions and the recursive structure of Bellman updates, and extends classical
tools such as the elliptical potential lemma to multi-output settings. This
work advances the understanding of TS in RL and highlights how structural
assumptions and model uncertainty shape its performance in finite-horizon
Markov Decision Processes.

Method: 将思想通信形式化为一个通用的潜变量模型，通过理论证明在非参数设置下可以识别共享和私有的潜在思想，并开发了一个框架来提取所有代理的潜在思想并在通信前分配相关思想。

Result: 在合成和真实世界基准测试上的实验验证了理论，并证明了思想通信在协作方面的优势。

Conclusion: 这项工作揭示了利用隐藏世界的潜力，因为许多挑战仅通过表面观察是无法解决的，无论计算或数据规模如何。

Abstract: Natural language has long enabled human cooperation, but its lossy,
ambiguous, and indirect nature limits the potential of collective intelligence.
While machines are not subject to these constraints, most LLM-based multi-agent
systems still rely solely on natural language, exchanging tokens or their
embeddings. To go beyond language, we introduce a new paradigm, thought
communication, which enables agents to interact directly mind-to-mind, akin to
telepathy. To uncover these latent thoughts in a principled way, we formalize
the process as a general latent variable model, where agent states are
generated by an unknown function of underlying thoughts. We prove that, in a
nonparametric setting without auxiliary information, both shared and private
latent thoughts between any pair of agents can be identified. Moreover, the
global structure of thought sharing, including which agents share which
thoughts and how these relationships are structured, can also be recovered with
theoretical guarantees. Guided by the established theory, we develop a
framework that extracts latent thoughts from all agents prior to communication
and assigns each agent the relevant thoughts, along with their sharing
patterns. This paradigm naturally extends beyond LLMs to all modalities, as
most observational data arise from hidden generative processes. Experiments on
both synthetic and real-world benchmarks validate the theory and demonstrate
the collaborative advantages of thought communication. We hope this work
illuminates the potential of leveraging the hidden world, as many challenges
remain unsolvable through surface-level observation alone, regardless of
compute or data scale.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于狄利克雷过程的多模态学习框架，通过DP的富者愈富特性自动平衡模态内表示学习和跨模态对齐，在多个数据集上表现优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多模态融合中如何在保持各模态特征表达能力的同时学习跨模态交互的关键挑战，避免过度强调模态边缘分布对齐导致的过度正则化和模态内有意义表示的阻碍。

Method: 假设每个模态遵循多元高斯分布的混合，采用狄利克雷过程计算所有组分的混合权重，利用DP的富者愈富特性动态分配特征贡献并选择最突出的特征。

Result: 在多个多模态数据集上的广泛实验表明，该模型优于其他竞争方法，消融分析验证了DP在模态分布对齐方面的有效性和对关键超参数变化的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 提出的DP驱动多模态学习框架能够自动实现模态内突出表示学习和跨模态对齐之间的最优平衡，为多模态特征融合提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Developing effective multimodal fusion approaches has become increasingly
essential in many real-world scenarios, such as health care and finance. The
key challenge is how to preserve the feature expressiveness in each modality
while learning cross-modal interactions. Previous approaches primarily focus on
the cross-modal alignment, while over-emphasis on the alignment of marginal
distributions of modalities may impose excess regularization and obstruct
meaningful representations within each modality. The Dirichlet process (DP)
mixture model is a powerful Bayesian non-parametric method that can amplify the
most prominent features by its richer-gets-richer property, which allocates
increasing weights to them. Inspired by this unique characteristic of DP, we
propose a new DP-driven multimodal learning framework that automatically
achieves an optimal balance between prominent intra-modal representation
learning and cross-modal alignment. Specifically, we assume that each modality
follows a mixture of multivariate Gaussian distributions and further adopt DP
to calculate the mixture weights for all the components. This paradigm allows
DP to dynamically allocate the contributions of features and select the most
prominent ones, leveraging its richer-gets-richer property, thus facilitating
multimodal feature fusion. Extensive experiments on several multimodal datasets
demonstrate the superior performance of our model over other competitors.
Ablation analysis further validates the effectiveness of DP in aligning
modality distributions and its robustness to changes in key hyperparameters.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MEIcoder是一种生物启发的解码方法，利用神经元特异性最兴奋输入(MEIs)、结构相似性指数损失和对抗训练，在小数据集上实现视觉刺激重建的SOTA性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 灵长类或人类神经数据稀缺，限制了深度学习解码技术的应用，需要克服数据不足的挑战。

Method: 结合神经元特异性MEIs、结构相似性指数损失和对抗训练，构建生物信息解码框架。

Result: 在V1区单细胞活动重建视觉刺激方面表现优异，仅需1000-2500个神经元和少于1000个训练样本即可重建高保真自然图像。

Conclusion: 证明了早期视觉系统可靠解码的可行性，为神经科学和神经工程应用提供了实用见解。

Abstract: Decoding visual stimuli from neural population activity is crucial for
understanding the brain and for applications in brain-machine interfaces.
However, such biological data is often scarce, particularly in primates or
humans, where high-throughput recording techniques, such as two-photon imaging,
remain challenging or impossible to apply. This, in turn, poses a challenge for
deep learning decoding techniques. To overcome this, we introduce MEIcoder, a
biologically informed decoding method that leverages neuron-specific most
exciting inputs (MEIs), a structural similarity index measure loss, and
adversarial training. MEIcoder achieves state-of-the-art performance in
reconstructing visual stimuli from single-cell activity in primary visual
cortex (V1), especially excelling on small datasets with fewer recorded
neurons. Using ablation studies, we demonstrate that MEIs are the main drivers
of the performance, and in scaling experiments, we show that MEIcoder can
reconstruct high-fidelity natural-looking images from as few as 1,000-2,500
neurons and less than 1,000 training data points. We also propose a unified
benchmark with over 160,000 samples to foster future research. Our results
demonstrate the feasibility of reliable decoding in early visual system and
provide practical insights for neuroscience and neuroengineering applications.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 这篇论文研究了Transformer模型在象棋任务中的系统泛化能力，发现模型能够进行组合泛化，在分布外场景中仍然遵循游戏规则并生成高质量走法，但在更复杂的变体如Chess960中表现不如符号AI算法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究现代决策Transformer是否真正理解象棋规则，而不仅仅是学习训练数据中的模式，通过测试模型在分布外场景中的表现来评估其系统泛化能力。

Method: 训练了一个2.7亿参数的象棋Transformer模型，并在设计好的分布外场景中进行测试，包括规则外推和Chess960变体，同时分析训练动态。

Result: 模型展现出组合泛化能力，在分布外场景中能持续选择有效走法，对OOD谜题也能生成高质量走法。在Chess960中表现不如符号AI，但与人类玩家对弈时差距较小。训练动态显示模型最初只学习移动己方棋子。

Conclusion: Transformer模型确实能够捕捉象棋的基本规则并展现出组合泛化能力，但在需要深度策略适应的复杂变体中仍不如基于显式搜索的符号AI方法。

Abstract: Chess is a canonical example of a task that requires rigorous reasoning and
long-term planning. Modern decision Transformers - trained similarly to LLMs -
are able to learn competent gameplay, but it is unclear to what extent they
truly capture the rules of chess. To investigate this, we train a 270M
parameter chess Transformer and test it on out-of-distribution scenarios,
designed to reveal failures of systematic generalization. Our analysis shows
that Transformers exhibit compositional generalization, as evidenced by strong
rule extrapolation: they adhere to fundamental syntactic rules of the game by
consistently choosing valid moves even in situations very different from the
training data. Moreover, they also generate high-quality moves for OOD puzzles.
In a more challenging test, we evaluate the models on variants including
Chess960 (Fischer Random Chess) - a variant of chess where starting positions
of pieces are randomized. We found that while the model exhibits basic strategy
adaptation, they are inferior to symbolic AI algorithms that perform explicit
search, but gap is smaller when playing against users on Lichess. Moreover, the
training dynamics revealed that the model initially learns to move only its own
pieces, suggesting an emergent compositional understanding of the game.

*Liang Ye,Shengqin Chen,Jiazhu Dai*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: BadGraph：针对文本引导图生成的潜在扩散模型的隐蔽后门攻击方法，通过文本触发器在训练数据中植入后门，在推理时生成攻击者指定的子图，同时保持对干净输入的正常性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着图生成技术的快速发展，后门漏洞等安全问题日益突出。现有研究主要关注图像扩散和无条件图生成的后门攻击，而条件性（特别是文本引导）图生成的后门安全问题尚未得到充分研究。

Method: BadGraph利用文本触发器污染训练数据，在潜在扩散模型中隐蔽地植入后门。当推理时出现触发器时，模型会生成攻击者指定的子图，而对干净输入则保持正常性能。

Result: 在四个基准数据集（PubChem、ChEBI-20、PCDes、MoMu）上的实验表明：低于10%的污染率即可达到50%的攻击成功率，24%的污染率可实现超过80%的成功率，且对良性样本的性能影响可忽略不计。消融研究显示后门是在VAE和扩散训练阶段植入的，而非预训练阶段。

Conclusion: 这些发现揭示了文本引导图生成的潜在扩散模型中的安全漏洞，强调了在药物发现等模型应用中存在的严重风险，并凸显了对此类扩散模型进行后门攻击防御的必要性。

Abstract: The rapid progress of graph generation has raised new security concerns,
particularly regarding backdoor vulnerabilities. While prior work has explored
backdoor attacks in image diffusion and unconditional graph generation,
conditional, especially text-guided graph generation remains largely
unexamined. This paper proposes BadGraph, a backdoor attack method targeting
latent diffusion models for text-guided graph generation. BadGraph leverages
textual triggers to poison training data, covertly implanting backdoors that
induce attacker-specified subgraphs during inference when triggers appear,
while preserving normal performance on clean inputs. Extensive experiments on
four benchmark datasets (PubChem, ChEBI-20, PCDes, MoMu) demonstrate the
effectiveness and stealth of the attack: less than 10% poisoning rate can
achieves 50% attack success rate, while 24% suffices for over 80% success rate,
with negligible performance degradation on benign samples. Ablation studies
further reveal that the backdoor is implanted during VAE and diffusion training
rather than pretraining. These findings reveal the security vulnerabilities in
latent diffusion models of text-guided graph generation, highlight the serious
risks in models' applications such as drug discovery and underscore the need
for robust defenses against the backdoor attack in such diffusion models.

*Shiva Sreeram,Alaa Maalouf,Pratyusha Sharma,Daniela Rus*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种快速、无需微调的LLM适配方法，通过选择性矩阵降维来提升下游任务准确率，相比之前的LASER方法大幅减少了计算开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LASER方法虽然能通过修剪LLM权重矩阵的高阶组件来提升准确率，但其逐层搜索和全数据集前向传播的计算开销使其难以快速部署。

Method: 使用矩阵奇异值的梯度来识别需要降维的关键矩阵；允许矩阵行围绕多个子空间聚类并分别分解；仅需100个样本计算梯度和评估准确率。

Result: 该方法将准确率提升高达24.6个百分点，同时大幅减少了搜索时间，仅需单次梯度步骤和少量样本即可完成适配。

Conclusion: 结合这些发现，开发出了一个快速、稳健的LLM下游任务适配算法，完全无需微调即可有效适应新数据集。

Abstract: Recently, Sharma et al. suggested a method called Layer-SElective-Rank
reduction (LASER) which demonstrated that pruning high-order components of
carefully chosen LLM's weight matrices can boost downstream accuracy -- without
any gradient-based fine-tuning. Yet LASER's exhaustive, per-matrix search (each
requiring full-dataset forward passes) makes it impractical for rapid
deployment. We demonstrate that this overhead can be removed and find that: (i)
Only a small, carefully chosen subset of matrices needs to be inspected --
eliminating the layer-by-layer sweep, (ii) The gradient of each matrix's
singular values pinpoints which matrices merit reduction, (iii) Increasing the
factorization search space by allowing matrices rows to cluster around multiple
subspaces and then decomposing each cluster separately further reduces
overfitting on the original training data and further lifts accuracy by up to
24.6 percentage points, and finally, (iv) we discover that evaluating on just
100 samples rather than the full training data -- both for computing the
indicative gradients and for measuring the final accuracy -- suffices to
further reduce the search time; we explain that as adaptation to downstream
tasks is dominated by prompting style, not dataset size. As a result, we show
that combining these findings yields a fast and robust adaptation algorithm for
downstream tasks. Overall, with a single gradient step on 100 examples and a
quick scan of the top candidate layers and factorization techniques, we can
adapt LLMs to new datasets -- entirely without fine-tuning.

### [102] [KL-Regularized Reinforcement Learning is Designed to Mode Collapse](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20817)
*Anthony GX-Chen,Jatin Prakash,Jeff Guo,Rob Fergus,Rajesh Ranganath*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文挑战了关于反向/正向KL散度优化的传统直觉，发现在强化学习中，KL散度的选择主要决定最优目标分布族，而模态覆盖度取决于正则化强度、奖励与参考概率的相对尺度等因素。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统观点认为反向KL导致"模态寻求"，正向KL导致"质量覆盖"，但作者发现这种直觉在强化学习中不一定成立，需要重新理解KL正则化在语言模型强化学习中的作用。

Method: 通过数学分析和实证研究，构建了一个简单、可扩展且理论合理的算法，只需最小化修改奖励幅度，就能优化目标分布以覆盖所有高质量采样模态。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在大型语言模型和化学语言模型的后训练中都能提高解决方案的质量和多样性，无需外部多样性信号，且适用于正向和反向KL。

Conclusion: KL散度的选择不是决定模态覆盖度的主要因素，关键在于正则化强度和其他参数的设置。提出的简单修改能有效提升模型性能的多样性和质量。

Abstract: It is commonly believed that optimizing the reverse KL divergence results in
"mode seeking", while optimizing forward KL results in "mass covering", with
the latter being preferred if the goal is to sample from multiple diverse
modes. We show -- mathematically and empirically -- that this intuition does
not necessarily transfer well to doing reinforcement learning with
reverse/forward KL regularization (e.g. as commonly used with language models).
Instead, the choice of reverse/forward KL determines the family of optimal
target distributions, parameterized by the regularization coefficient. Mode
coverage depends primarily on other factors, such as regularization strength,
and relative scales between rewards and reference probabilities. Further, we
show commonly used settings such as low regularization strength and equal
verifiable rewards tend to specify unimodal target distributions, meaning the
optimization objective is, by construction, non-diverse. We leverage these
insights to construct a simple, scalable, and theoretically justified
algorithm. It makes minimal changes to reward magnitudes, yet optimizes for a
target distribution which puts high probability over all high-quality sampling
modes. In experiments, this simple modification works to post-train both Large
Language Models and Chemical Language Models to have higher solution quality
and diversity, without any external signals of diversity, and works with both
forward and reverse KL when using either naively fails.

TL;DR: 本文通过实验证明，在商用DRAM芯片中利用同时多行激活(SiMRA)技术可以生成高质量的真随机数，具有高吞吐量和低延迟特性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发一种基于商用DRAM芯片的高性能真随机数生成器(TRNG)，利用SiMRA技术克服现有DRAM-based TRNG在吞吐量方面的限制。

Method: 对96个DDR4 DRAM芯片进行广泛表征，研究不同同时激活行数(2,4,8,16,32)、数据模式、温度水平和空间变化对SiMRA真随机生成潜力的影响。

Result: 所有SiMRA-based TRNG设计都通过了NIST随机性测试；与最先进的DRAM-based TRNG相比，2、8、16、32行激活设计的吞吐量分别提高了1.15x、1.99x、1.82x和1.39x；熵随激活行数增加而增加；操作参数显著影响熵。

Conclusion: SiMRA技术为在商用DRAM芯片中实现高性能真随机数生成提供了可行方案，开源了研究基础设施以促进未来发展。

Abstract: In this work, we experimentally demonstrate that it is possible to generate
true random numbers at high throughput and low latency in commercial
off-the-shelf (COTS) DRAM chips by leveraging simultaneous multiple-row
activation (SiMRA) via an extensive characterization of 96 DDR4 DRAM chips. We
rigorously analyze SiMRA's true random generation potential in terms of
entropy, latency, and throughput for varying numbers of simultaneously
activated DRAM rows (i.e., 2, 4, 8, 16, and 32), data patterns, temperature
levels, and spatial variations. Among our 11 key experimental observations, we
highlight four key results. First, we evaluate the quality of our TRNG designs
using the commonly-used NIST statistical test suite for randomness and find
that all SiMRA-based TRNG designs successfully pass each test. Second, 2-, 8-,
16-, and 32-row activation-based TRNG designs outperform the state-of-theart
DRAM-based TRNG in throughput by up to 1.15x, 1.99x, 1.82x, and 1.39x,
respectively. Third, SiMRA's entropy tends to increase with the number of
simultaneously activated DRAM rows. Fourth, operational parameters and
conditions (e.g., data pattern and temperature) significantly affect entropy.
For example, for most of the tested modules, the average entropy of 32-row
activation is 2.51x higher than that of 2-row activation. For example,
increasing the temperature from 50{\deg}C to 90{\deg}C decreases SiMRA's
entropy by 1.53x for 32-row activation. To aid future research and development,
we open-source our infrastructure at https://github.com/CMU-SAFARI/SiMRA-TRNG.

<details>

Motivation: 传统通用加速器（如SIMD和GPGPU）在处理复杂数据依赖模式时存在局限性，而定制FPGA/ASIC设计成本高且缺乏灵活性。需要一种能有效处理依赖密集型内核的通用加速方案。

Method: 设计Squire加速器，每个加速器包含一组低功耗顺序核心，这些核心能快速相互通信并直接访问L2缓存。在典型多核系统中为每个核心集成一个Squire加速器。

Result: 在动态规划内核中实现最高7.64倍加速，端到端应用加速3.66倍，能耗降低高达56%，相比Neoverse-N1基线仅增加10.5%的面积开销。

Conclusion: Squire提供了一种高效处理依赖密集型内核的通用加速方案，在保持低硬件开销的同时显著提升性能和能效。

Abstract: Multiple HPC applications are often bottlenecked by compute-intensive kernels
implementing complex dependency patterns (data-dependency bound). Traditional
general-purpose accelerators struggle to effectively exploit fine-grain
parallelism due to limitations in implementing convoluted data-dependency
patterns (like SIMD) and overheads due to synchronization and data transfers
(like GPGPUs). In contrast, custom FPGA and ASIC designs offer improved
performance and energy efficiency at a high cost in hardware design and
programming complexity and often lack the flexibility to process different
workloads. We propose Squire, a general-purpose accelerator designed to exploit
fine-grain parallelism effectively on dependency-bound kernels. Each Squire
accelerator has a set of general-purpose low-power in-order cores that can
rapidly communicate among themselves and directly access data from the L2
cache. Our proposal integrates one Squire accelerator per core in a typical
multicore system, allowing the acceleration of dependency-bound kernels within
parallel tasks with minimal software changes. As a case study, we evaluate
Squire's effectiveness by accelerating five kernels that implement complex
dependency patterns. We use three of these kernels to build an end-to-end
read-mapping tool that will be used to evaluate Squire. Squire obtains speedups
up to 7.64$\times$ in dynamic programming kernels. Overall, Squire provides an
acceleration for an end-to-end application of 3.66$\times$. In addition, Squire
reduces energy consumption by up to 56% with a minimal area overhead of 10.5%
compared to a Neoverse-N1 baseline.

Abstract: As we evolve towards more heterogeneous and cutting-edge mobile networks,
Network Digital Twins (NDTs) are proving to be a promising paradigm in solving
challenges faced by network operators, as they give a possibility of
replicating the physical network operations and testing scenarios separately
without interfering with the live network. However, with mobile networks
becoming increasingly dynamic and heterogeneous due to massive device
connectivity, replicating traffic and having NDTs synchronized in real-time
with the physical network remains a challenge, thus necessitating the need to
develop real-time adaptive mechanisms to bridge this gap. In this part II of
our work, we implement a novel framework that integrates an adaptive
Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) controller to dynamically improve
synchronization. Additionally, through an interactive user interface, results
of our enhanced approach demonstrate an improvement in real-time traffic
synchronization.

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: 本文简化了Khoury和Schild的轮消除自约简技术，并应用该技术证明了最大b匹配和边着色的随机LOCAL算法下界。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Khoury和Schild提出的最大匹配下界证明虽然优美但长达25页，技术细节复杂难以消化和推广。历史上证明和技术的简化对理解图问题复杂性有重要意义。

Method: 提出轮消除自约简技术的简化版本，并应用该技术分析最大b匹配和边着色问题。

Result: 证明了最大b匹配需要Ω(min{log₁₊ᵦΔ, log_Δ n})和Ω(√log₁₊ᵦ n)轮；边着色需要Ω(min{log Δ, log_Δ n})和Ω(√log n)轮。

Conclusion: 成功简化了轮消除自约简技术，并获得了最大b匹配和边着色的新下界结果，为理解分布式图算法复杂性提供了更简洁的工具。

Abstract: Very recently, Khoury and Schild [FOCS 2025] showed that any randomized LOCAL
algorithm that solves maximal matching requires $\Omega(\min\{\log \Delta,
\log_\Delta n\})$ rounds, where $n$ is the number of nodes in the graph and
$\Delta$ is the maximum degree. This result is shown through a new technique,
called round elimination via self-reduction. The lower bound proof is beautiful
and presents very nice ideas. However, it spans more than 25 pages of technical
details, and hence it is hard to digest and generalize to other problems.
Historically, the simplification of proofs and techniques has marked an
important turning point in our understanding of the complexity of graph
problems. Our paper makes a step forward towards this direction, and provides
the following contributions.
  1. We present a short and simplified version of the round elimination via
self-reduction technique. The simplification of this technique enables us to
obtain the following two hardness results.
  2. We show that any randomized LOCAL algorithm that solves the maximal
$b$-matching problem requires $\Omega(\min\{\log_{1+b}\Delta, \log_\Delta n\})$
and $\Omega(\sqrt{\log_{1+b} n})$ rounds. We recall that the $b$-matching
problem is a generalization of the matching problem where each vertex can have
up to $b$ incident edges in the matching. As a corollary, for $b=1$, we obtain
a short proof for the maximal matching lower bound shown by Khoury and Schild.
  3. Finally, we show that any randomized LOCAL algorithm that properly colors
the edges of a graph with $\Delta + k$ colors requires $\Omega(\min\{\log
\Delta, \log_\Delta n\})$ and $\Omega(\sqrt{\log n})$ rounds, for any $k\le
\Delta^{1-\varepsilon}$ and any constant $\varepsilon > 0$.

Motivation: 现有ND并行方法复杂繁琐，而ZeRO等方法存在通信开销问题，需要更高效简单的大规模训练方案

Method: 采用自适应分片策略，在不同副本组间重新分片参数、梯度和优化器状态，并使用多流异步调度在后台线程执行通信操作

Conclusion: AsyncHZP实现了最先进的性能，简化了大规模训练路径，是高效可扩展的并行训练方案

Abstract: The training efficiency and scalability of language models on massive
clusters currently remain a critical bottleneck. Mainstream approaches like ND
parallelism are often cumbersome and complex, while flexible alternatives such
as the Zero Redundancy Optimizer (ZeRO) are frequently hampered by
communication overhead. In this paper, we propose Asynchronous Hierarchical
Zero Parallelism (AsyncHZP), a novel asynchronous variant of ZeRO designed to
achieve superior performance while maintaining simplicity and memory
efficiency. Unlike traditional ZeRO, which employs over-fine-grained sharding
that can lead to inefficient communication, AsyncHZP adaptively reshards
parameters, gradients, and optimizer states across different replica groups.
This strategy optimizes device memory utilization and significantly reduces
communication overhead. In addition, we also design a multi-stream asynchronous
scheduling method that executes parameter all-gather and gradient
reduce-scatter operations in dedicated background threads, effectively
overlapping communication with computation while incurring negligible memory
fragmentation. Empirical evaluations on both Dense and Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)
models confirm that AsyncHZP maintains robust stability at scale. It
consistently outperforms classic ND parallelism, achieving state-of-the-art
performance without complex strategic tuning, thereby simplifying the path to

Abstract: To address the growing needs for scalable High Performance Computing (HPC)
and Quantum Computing (QC) integration, we present our HPC-QC full stack
framework and its hybrid workload development capability with modular
hardware/device-agnostic software integration approach. The latest development
in extensible interfaces for quantum programming, dispatching, and compilation
within existing mature HPC programming environment are demonstrated. Our HPC-QC
full stack enables high-level, portable invocation of quantum kernels from
commercial quantum SDKs within HPC meta-program in compiled languages (C/C++
and Fortran) as well as Python through a quantum programming interface library
extension. An adaptive circuit knitting hypervisor is being developed to
partition large quantum circuits into sub-circuits that fit on smaller noisy
quantum devices and classical simulators. At the lower-level, we leverage Cray
LLVM-based compilation framework to transform and consume LLVM IR and Quantum
IR (QIR) from commercial quantum software frontends in a retargetable fashion
to different hardware architectures. Several hybrid HPC-QC multi-node multi-CPU
and GPU workloads (including solving linear system of equations, quantum
optimization, and simulating quantum phase transitions) have been demonstrated
on HPE EX supercomputers to illustrate functionality and execution viability
for all three components developed so far. This work provides the framework for
a unified quantum-classical programming environment built upon classical HPC
software stack (compilers, libraries, parallel runtime and process scheduling).

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统通信方法在数十万GPU规模下面临吞吐量和延迟限制，阻碍了最先进模型的发展与部署

Method: 开发了NCCLX集体通信框架，针对LLM全生命周期优化，从大规模训练的同步需求到推理的低延迟要求

Abstract: The increasing scale of large language models (LLMs) necessitates highly
efficient collective communication frameworks, particularly as training
workloads extend to hundreds of thousands of GPUs. Traditional communication
methods face significant throughput and latency limitations at this scale,
hindering both the development and deployment of state-of-the-art models. This
paper presents the NCCLX collective communication framework, developed at Meta,
engineered to optimize performance across the full LLM lifecycle, from the
synchronous demands of large-scale training to the low-latency requirements of
inference. The framework is designed to support complex workloads on clusters
exceeding 100,000 GPUs, ensuring reliable, high-throughput, and low-latency
data exchange. Empirical evaluation on the Llama4 model demonstrates
substantial improvements in communication efficiency. This research contributes
a robust solution for enabling the next generation of LLMs to operate at
unprecedented scales.

Abstract: Cloud computing has established itself as the support for the vast majority
of emerging technologies, mainly due to the characteristic of elasticity it
offers. Auto-scalers are the systems that enable this elasticity by acquiring
and releasing resources on demand to ensure an agreed service level. In this
article we present FLAS (Forecasted Load Auto-Scaling), an auto-scaler for
distributed services that combines the advantages of proactive and reactive
approaches according to the situation to decide the optimal scaling actions in
every moment. The main novelties introduced by FLAS are (i) a predictive model
of the high-level metrics trend which allows to anticipate changes in the
relevant SLA parameters (e.g. performance metrics such as response time or
throughput) and (ii) a reactive contingency system based on the estimation of
high-level metrics from resource use metrics, reducing the necessary
instrumentation (less invasive) and allowing it to be adapted agnostically to
different applications. We provide a FLAS implementation for the use case of a
content-based publish-subscribe middleware (E-SilboPS) that is the cornerstone
of an event-driven architecture. To the best of our knowledge, this is the
first auto-scaling system for content-based publish-subscribe distributed
systems (although it is generic enough to fit any distributed service). Through
an evaluation based on several test cases recreating not only the expected
contexts of use, but also the worst possible scenarios (following the
Boundary-Value Analysis or BVA test methodology), we have validated our
approach and demonstrated the effectiveness of our solution by ensuring
compliance with performance requirements over 99% of the time.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of application performance is critical for enabling
effective scheduling and resource management in resource-constrained dynamic
edge environments. However, achieving predictable performance in such
environments remains challenging due to the co-location of multiple
applications and the node heterogeneity. To address this, we propose a
methodology that automatically builds and assesses various performance
predictors. This approach prioritizes both accuracy and inference time to
identify the most efficient model. Our predictors achieve up to 90% accuracy
while maintaining an inference time of less than 1% of the Round Trip Time.
These predictors are trained on the historical state of the most correlated
monitoring metrics to application performance and evaluated across multiple
servers in dynamic co-location scenarios. As usecase we consider electron
microscopy (EM) workflows, which have stringent real-time demands and diverse
resource requirements. Our findings emphasize the need for a systematic
methodology that selects server-specific predictors by jointly optimizing
accuracy and inference latency in dynamic co-location scenarios. Integrating
such predictors into edge environments can improve resource utilization and
result in predictable performance.

Abstract: Distributed applications increasingly demand low end-to-end latency,
especially in edge and cloud environments where co-located workloads contend
for limited resources. Traditional load-balancing strategies are typically
reactive and rely on outdated or coarse-grained metrics, often leading to
suboptimal routing decisions and increased tail latencies. This paper
investigates the use of round-trip time (RTT) predictors to enhance request
routing by anticipating application latency. We develop lightweight and
accurate RTT predictors that are trained on time-series monitoring data
collected from a Kubernetes-managed GPU cluster. By leveraging a reduced set of
highly correlated monitoring metrics, our approach maintains low overhead while
remaining adaptable to diverse co-location scenarios and heterogeneous
hardware. The predictors achieve up to 95% accuracy while keeping the
prediction delay within 10% of the application RTT. In addition, we identify
the minimum prediction accuracy threshold and key system-level factors required
to ensure effective predictor deployment in resource-constrained clusters.
Simulation-based evaluation demonstrates that performance-aware load balancing
can significantly reduce application RTT and minimize resource waste. These
results highlight the feasibility of integrating predictive load balancing into
future production systems.
