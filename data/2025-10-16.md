### [1] [Local Timescale Gates for Timescale-Robust Continual Spiking Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12843)
*Ansh Tiwari,Ayush Chauhan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了LT-Gate神经元模型，通过双时间尺度动态和自适应门控机制解决SNN在持续学习中的稳定性-可塑性困境，显著提升了时序分类任务的准确率和记忆保持能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决脉冲神经网络在需要快速适应和长期记忆的持续学习任务中的性能瓶颈，特别是在稳定性和可塑性之间的平衡问题。

Method: LT-Gate神经元模型：每个神经元并行跟踪快慢两个时间尺度的信息，通过学习到的门控机制局部调整它们的影响；引入方差跟踪正则化来稳定放电活动。

Result: 在挑战性时序分类基准测试中达到约51%的最终准确率，优于Hebbian持续学习基线的约46%和先前的SNN方法；完全兼容神经形态硬件，特别是Intel Loihi芯片。

Conclusion: 多时间尺度门控机制显著增强了SNN的持续学习能力，缩小了脉冲网络与传统深度网络在终身学习任务上的差距。

Abstract: Spiking neural networks (SNNs) promise energy-efficient artificial
intelligence on neuromorphic hardware but struggle with tasks requiring both
fast adaptation and long-term memory, especially in continual learning. We
propose Local Timescale Gating (LT-Gate), a neuron model that combines dual
time-constant dynamics with an adaptive gating mechanism. Each spiking neuron
tracks information on a fast and a slow timescale in parallel, and a learned
gate locally adjusts their influence. This design enables individual neurons to
preserve slow contextual information while responding to fast signals,
addressing the stability-plasticity dilemma. We further introduce a
variance-tracking regularization that stabilizes firing activity, inspired by
biological homeostasis. Empirically, LT-Gate yields significantly improved
accuracy and retention in sequential learning tasks: on a challenging temporal
classification benchmark it achieves about 51 percent final accuracy, compared
to about 46 percent for a recent Hebbian continual-learning baseline and lower
for prior SNN methods. Unlike approaches that require external replay or
expensive orthogonalizations, LT-Gate operates with local updates and is fully
compatible with neuromorphic hardware. In particular, it leverages features of
Intel's Loihi chip (multiple synaptic traces with different decay rates) for
on-chip learning. Our results demonstrate that multi-timescale gating can
substantially enhance continual learning in SNNs, narrowing the gap between
spiking and conventional deep networks on lifelong-learning tasks.

### [2] [Multivariate Time Series Forecasting with Gate-Based Quantum Reservoir Computing on NISQ Hardware](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13634)
*Wissal Hamhoum,Soumaya Cherkaoui,Jean-Frederic Laprade,Ola Ahmed,Shengrui Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于门的量子储层计算方法，用于多变量时间序列预测，该方法针对当前量子设备的连接性和深度限制进行了优化，并在实际量子硬件上验证了其可行性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的量子储层计算研究主要关注单变量信号，且忽视了近期量子硬件的实际限制。本文旨在开发一种适用于多变量时间序列预测的量子储层计算方法，并验证其在当前NISQ设备上的实用性。

Method: 提出了一种基于门的量子储层计算方法，通过配对注入量子比特和记忆量子比特，使用经过Trotter化的最近邻横向场Ising演化，针对当前量子设备的连接性和深度限制进行优化。

Result: 在Lorenz-63和ENSO数据集上，该方法分别获得了0.0087和0.0036的均方误差，性能与经典储层计算相当，在某些情况下优于学习型RNN。在IBM Heron R2量子硬件上，该方法在现实深度下保持准确性，有趣的是在ENSO数据集上甚至优于无噪声模拟器。

Conclusion: 研究结果表明基于门的量子储层计算方法在当前NISQ硬件上具有实际应用价值，设备噪声在某些情况下可能通过集中特征方向上的方差来充当隐式正则化器，这激励了对硬件噪声何时以及如何有益于量子储层计算输出的系统性研究。

Abstract: Quantum reservoir computing (QRC) offers a hardware-friendly approach to
temporal learning, yet most studies target univariate signals and overlook
near-term hardware constraints. This work introduces a gate-based QRC for
multivariate time series (MTS-QRC) that pairs injection and memory qubits and
uses a Trotterized nearest-neighbor transverse-field Ising evolution optimized
for current device connectivity and depth. On Lorenz-63 and ENSO, the method
achieves a mean square error (MSE) of 0.0087 and 0.0036, respectively,
performing on par with classical reservoir computing on Lorenz and above
learned RNNs on both, while NVAR and clustered ESN remain stronger on some
settings. On IBM Heron R2, MTS-QRC sustains accuracy with realistic depths and,
interestingly, outperforms a noiseless simulator on ENSO; singular value
analysis indicates that device noise can concentrate variance in feature
directions, acting as an implicit regularizer for linear readout in this
regime. These findings support the practicality of gate-based QRC for MTS
forecasting on NISQ hardware and motivate systematic studies on when and how
hardware noise benefits QRC readouts.

### [3] [Lifting Manifolds to Mitigate Pseudo-Alignment in LLM4TS](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12847)
*Liangwei Nathan Zheng,Wenhao Liang,Wei Emma Zhang,Miao Xu,Olaf Maennel,Weitong Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文研究了时间序列大语言模型中的伪对齐问题，提出TimeSUP方法通过增加时间序列流形维度来缓解该问题，显著提升了预测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 伪对齐问题导致时间序列大语言模型表现不佳，甚至不如线性模型或随机初始化模型，但社区对此问题的原因讨论有限。

Method: 提出了TimeSUP方法，通过增加时间序列流形维度使其更接近语言嵌入的内在维度，同时保持模态间共享结构，使时间和语言标记表示既区分又相似。

Result: TimeSUP在长期预测性能上持续优于最先进的LLM4TS方法和其他轻量级基线，可无缝集成到四个现有LLM4TS管道中并显著提升预测性能。

Conclusion: 伪对齐源于预训练LLM组件中的锥效应与时间序列数据内在低维流形的相互作用，TimeSUP通过调整流形维度有效缓解了这一问题。

Abstract: Pseudo-Alignment is a pervasive challenge in many large language models for
time series (LLM4TS) models, often causing them to underperform compared to
linear models or randomly initialised backbones. However, there is limited
discussion in the community for the reasons that pseudo-alignment occurs. In
this work, we conduct a thorough investigation into the root causes of
pseudo-alignment in LLM4TS and build a connection of pseudo-alignment to the
cone effect in LLM. We demonstrate that pseudo-alignment arises from the
interplay of cone effect within pretrained LLM components and the intrinsically
low-dimensional manifold of time-series data. In addition, we also introduce
\textit{\textbf{TimeSUP}}, a novel technique designed to mitigate this issue
and improve forecast performance in existing LLM4TS approaches. TimeSUP
addresses this by increasing the time series manifold to more closely match the
intrinsic dimension of language embeddings, allowing the model to distinguish
temporal signals clearly while still capturing shared structures across
modalities. As a result, representations for time and language tokens remain
distinct yet exhibit high cosine similarity, signifying that the model
preserves each modality unique features while learning their commonalities in a
unified embedding space. Empirically, TimeSUP consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art LLM4TS methods and other lightweight baselines on long-term
forecasting performance. Furthermore, it can be seamlessly integrated into four
existing LLM4TS pipelines and delivers significant improvements in forecasting
performance.

### [4] [ArtNet: Hierarchical Clustering-Based Artificial Netlist Generator for ML and DTCO Application](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13582)
*Andrew B. Kahng. Seokhyeong Kang,Seonghyeon Park,Dooseok Yoon*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ArtNet是一种人工网表生成器，通过生成多样化的训练数据来改善机器学习模型的泛化能力，支持设计技术协同优化，在PPA优化方面取得了显著效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在先进节点中，功率、性能和面积优化变得复杂且具有挑战性，机器学习和设计技术协同优化面临训练数据不足和设计流程周期长的问题。

Method: 提出ArtNet人工网表生成器，复制关键拓扑特征，生成更接近目标参数的逼真人工数据集。

Result: 在CNN基DRV预测中，ArtNet数据增强使F1分数提高0.16；在DTCO中，生成的小型脑设计达到97.94%的PPA匹配度。

Conclusion: ArtNet通过生成多样化的人工训练数据，有效提升了机器学习模型的泛化能力和设计技术协同优化的效率。

Abstract: In advanced nodes, optimization of power, performance and area (PPA) has
become highly complex and challenging. Machine learning (ML) and
design-technology co-optimization (DTCO) provide promising mitigations, but
face limitations due to a lack of diverse training data as well as long design
flow turnaround times (TAT). We propose ArtNet, a novel artificial netlist
generator designed to tackle these issues. Unlike previous methods, ArtNet
replicates key topological characteristics, enhancing ML model generalization
and supporting broader design space exploration for DTCO. By producing
realistic artificial datasets that moreclosely match given target parameters,
ArtNet enables more efficient PPAoptimization and exploration of flows and
design enablements. In the context of CNN-based DRV prediction, ArtNet's data
augmentationimproves F1 score by 0.16 compared to using only the original
(real) dataset. In the DTCO context, ArtNet-generated mini-brains achieve a PPA
match up to 97.94%, demonstrating close alignment with design metrics of
targeted full-scale block designs.

### [5] [FedGTEA: Federated Class-Incremental Learning with Gaussian Task Embedding and Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12927)
*Haolin Li,Hoda Bidkhori*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了FedGTEA框架，用于联邦类增量学习，通过高斯任务嵌入和对齐来捕获任务特定知识并量化不确定性，具有可扩展性和通信效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决联邦学习中的类增量学习问题，需要处理统计异质性、数据不确定性，同时保持任务级隐私和系统可扩展性。

Method: 客户端使用CATE生成高斯分布的任务嵌入，服务器端使用2-Wasserstein距离测量任务间差距并制定Wasserstein损失来增强任务分离。

Result: 在多个流行数据集上的实验表明，FedGTEA实现了优越的分类性能，显著减轻了遗忘问题，并持续优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: FedGTEA通过概率化任务嵌入和对齐，有效解决了联邦类增量学习中的关键挑战，在性能、可扩展性和隐私保护方面表现出色。

Abstract: We introduce a novel framework for Federated Class Incremental Learning,
called Federated Gaussian Task Embedding and Alignment (FedGTEA). FedGTEA is
designed to capture task-specific knowledge and model uncertainty in a scalable
and communication-efficient manner. At the client side, the
Cardinality-Agnostic Task Encoder (CATE) produces Gaussian-distributed task
embeddings that encode task knowledge, address statistical heterogeneity, and
quantify data uncertainty. Importantly, CATE maintains a fixed parameter size
regardless of the number of tasks, which ensures scalability across long task
sequences. On the server side, FedGTEA utilizes the 2-Wasserstein distance to
measure inter-task gaps between Gaussian embeddings. We formulate the
Wasserstein loss to enforce inter-task separation. This probabilistic
formulation not only enhances representation learning but also preserves
task-level privacy by avoiding the direct transmission of latent embeddings,
aligning with the privacy constraints in federated learning. Extensive
empirical evaluations on popular datasets demonstrate that FedGTEA achieves
superior classification performance and significantly mitigates forgetting,
consistently outperforming strong existing baselines.

### [6] [Learning at the Speed of Physics: Equilibrium Propagation on Oscillator Ising Machines](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12934)
*Alex Gower*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文展示了在振荡器伊辛机(OIMs)上实现平衡传播(EP)的方法，将优化和采样统一到单一能量景观中，在MNIST和Fashion-MNIST数据集上达到竞争性准确率，同时保持对硬件约束的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 利用物理系统自然执行能量下降的特性来加速机器学习，特别是振荡器伊辛机(OIMs)的GHz频率动力学能够镜像能量基模型(EBMs)的优化和梯度下降，同时内在噪声对应朗之万动力学，支持采样和优化。

Method: 在振荡器伊辛机上实现平衡传播(EP)，将优化和采样过程统一到单一总能量景观中，实现无需全局反向传播的局部学习规则。

Result: 在MNIST数据集上达到97.2±0.1%的准确率，在Fashion-MNIST数据集上达到88.0±0.1%的准确率，同时在参数量化和相位噪声等现实硬件约束下保持鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 振荡器伊辛机是快速、节能的神经形态学习基底，能量基模型可能在直接执行其优化的物理硬件上找到实际实现途径。

Abstract: Physical systems that naturally perform energy descent offer a direct route
to accelerating machine learning. Oscillator Ising Machines (OIMs) exemplify
this idea: their GHz-frequency dynamics mirror both the optimization of
energy-based models (EBMs) and gradient descent on loss landscapes, while
intrinsic noise corresponds to Langevin dynamics - supporting sampling as well
as optimization. Equilibrium Propagation (EP) unifies these processes into
descent on a single total energy landscape, enabling local learning rules
without global backpropagation. We show that EP on OIMs achieves competitive
accuracy ($\sim 97.2 \pm 0.1 \%$ on MNIST, $\sim 88.0 \pm 0.1 \%$ on
Fashion-MNIST), while maintaining robustness under realistic hardware
constraints such as parameter quantization and phase noise. These results
establish OIMs as a fast, energy-efficient substrate for neuromorphic learning,
and suggest that EBMs - often bottlenecked by conventional processors - may
find practical realization on physical hardware whose dynamics directly perform
their optimization.

### [7] [Pruning Cannot Hurt Robustness: Certified Trade-offs in Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12939)
*James Pedley,Benjamin Etheridge,Stephen J. Roberts,Francesco Quinzan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文首次为状态对抗马尔可夫决策过程中的剪枝认证鲁棒性建立了理论框架，证明了元素级剪枝只会收紧鲁棒性边界，并通过三阶段遗憾分解揭示了性能-鲁棒性前沿。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界中的强化学习策略需要在对抗扰动下保持可靠性，而现代深度强化学习智能体过度参数化导致成本高昂和脆弱性问题。虽然剪枝在监督学习中已被证明能提高鲁棒性，但在对抗强化学习中的作用尚不清楚。

Method: 开发了状态对抗马尔可夫决策过程中的剪枝认证鲁棒性理论框架，针对高斯和分类策略的Lipschitz网络，证明了元素级剪枝能收紧鲁棒性边界，并提出了三阶段遗憾分解方法。

Result: 在连续控制基准测试中，剪枝在中等稀疏度水平下始终发现可复现的"最佳点"，鲁棒性显著提升而不损害甚至有时增强干净性能。

Conclusion: 剪枝不仅是压缩工具，更是强化学习鲁棒性的结构性干预手段，揭示了性能与鲁棒性之间的基本权衡关系。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) policies deployed in real-world environments must
remain reliable under adversarial perturbations. At the same time, modern deep
RL agents are heavily over-parameterized, raising costs and fragility concerns.
While pruning has been shown to improve robustness in supervised learning, its
role in adversarial RL remains poorly understood. We develop the first
theoretical framework for certified robustness under pruning in
state-adversarial Markov decision processes (SA-MDPs). For Gaussian and
categorical policies with Lipschitz networks, we prove that element-wise
pruning can only tighten certified robustness bounds; pruning never makes the
policy less robust. Building on this, we derive a novel three-term regret
decomposition that disentangles clean-task performance, pruning-induced
performance loss, and robustness gains, exposing a fundamental
performance--robustness frontier. Empirically, we evaluate magnitude and
micro-pruning schedules on continuous-control benchmarks with strong
policy-aware adversaries. Across tasks, pruning consistently uncovers
reproducible ``sweet spots'' at moderate sparsity levels, where robustness
improves substantially without harming - and sometimes even enhancing - clean
performance. These results position pruning not merely as a compression tool
but as a structural intervention for robust RL.

*Sana Tonekaboni,Lena Stempfle,Adibvafa Fallahpour,Walter Gerych,Marzyeh Ghassemi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一套黑盒评估测试方法，用于评估基于结构化电子健康记录训练的基础模型中的隐私相关记忆风险，包括嵌入层和生成层的记忆探测方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于大规模去标识化电子健康记录训练的基础模型在临床应用中具有潜力，但其记忆患者信息的能力引发了重要的隐私担忧，特别是对弱势群体的隐私风险。

Method: 开发了黑盒评估测试套件，包括在嵌入层和生成层探测记忆的方法，旨在区分模型泛化与有害记忆，并发布了开源工具包。

Result: 在公开可用的电子健康记录基础模型上验证了该方法，提供了可重现和协作的医疗AI隐私评估工具。

Conclusion: 该框架有助于评估基础模型在医疗领域的隐私风险，特别是识别可能损害患者隐私的有害记忆行为。

Abstract: Foundation models trained on large-scale de-identified electronic health
records (EHRs) hold promise for clinical applications. However, their capacity
to memorize patient information raises important privacy concerns. In this
work, we introduce a suite of black-box evaluation tests to assess
privacy-related memorization risks in foundation models trained on structured
EHR data. Our framework includes methods for probing memorization at both the
embedding and generative levels, and aims to distinguish between model
generalization and harmful memorization in clinically relevant settings. We
contextualize memorization in terms of its potential to compromise patient
privacy, particularly for vulnerable subgroups. We validate our approach on a
publicly available EHR foundation model and release an open-source toolkit to
facilitate reproducible and collaborative privacy assessments in healthcare AI.

### [9] [A Multimodal XAI Framework for Trustworthy CNNs and Bias Detection in Deep Representation Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12957)
*Noor Islam S. Mohammad*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种新颖的多模态可解释AI框架，通过注意力增强特征融合、Grad-CAM++本地解释和揭示-修正反馈循环来检测和缓解偏见，在MNIST多模态扩展数据集上表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准基准数据集（如MNIST）往往无法暴露潜在偏见和多模态特征复杂性，限制了深度神经网络在高风险应用中的可信度。

Method: 统一了注意力增强特征融合、基于Grad-CAM++的本地解释和用于偏见检测与缓解的揭示-修正反馈循环。

Result: 在MNIST多模态扩展数据集上达到93.2%分类准确率、91.6% F1分数和78.1%解释保真度（IoU-XAI），优于单模态和不可解释基线。

Conclusion: 将可解释性与偏见感知学习相结合增强了鲁棒性和人类对齐，为敏感领域中可信AI提供了实用路径。

Abstract: Standard benchmark datasets, such as MNIST, often fail to expose latent
biases and multimodal feature complexities, limiting the trustworthiness of
deep neural networks in high-stakes applications. We propose a novel multimodal
Explainable AI (XAI) framework that unifies attention-augmented feature fusion,
Grad-CAM++-based local explanations, and a Reveal-to-Revise feedback loop for
bias detection and mitigation. Evaluated on multimodal extensions of MNIST, our
approach achieves 93.2% classification accuracy, 91.6% F1-score, and 78.1%
explanation fidelity (IoU-XAI), outperforming unimodal and non-explainable
baselines. Ablation studies demonstrate that integrating interpretability with
bias-aware learning enhances robustness and human alignment. Our work bridges
the gap between performance, transparency, and fairness, highlighting a
practical pathway for trustworthy AI in sensitive domains.

### [10] [Balancing Performance and Reject Inclusion: A Novel Confident Inlier Extrapolation Framework for Credit Scoring](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12967)
*Athyrson Machado Ribeiro,Marcos Medeiros Raimundo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种新颖的置信内点外推框架(CI-EX)来解决信用评分中的拒绝推断问题，通过迭代识别被拒客户样本分布并基于监督分类模型概率分配标签，在保持AUC竞争力的同时显著提升了拒绝推断特定指标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统拒绝推断方法假设被拒客户行为可以从接受客户中推断，但忽略了两个群体之间可能存在的分布差异，导致盲目外推问题。

Method: CI-EX框架迭代使用异常检测模型识别被拒客户样本分布，并基于监督分类模型的概率为最接近接受群体分布的个体分配标签。

Result: 在两个大型真实信用数据集上的实验表明，CI-EX在拒绝推断特定指标上持续优于现有方法，同时在大多数实验中保持AUC的竞争力。

Conclusion: 拒绝推断方法通常需要在AUC和拒绝推断特定指标之间权衡，但提出的CI-EX框架在拒绝推断特定指标上表现优异，同时维持了AUC的竞争力。

Abstract: Reject Inference (RI) methods aim to address sample bias by inferring missing
repayment data for rejected credit applicants. Traditional approaches often
assume that the behavior of rejected clients can be extrapolated from accepted
clients, despite potential distributional differences between the two
populations. To mitigate this blind extrapolation, we propose a novel Confident
Inlier Extrapolation framework (CI-EX). CI-EX iteratively identifies the
distribution of rejected client samples using an outlier detection model and
assigns labels to rejected individuals closest to the distribution of the
accepted population based on probabilities derived from a supervised
classification model. The effectiveness of our proposed framework is validated
through experiments on two large real-world credit datasets. Performance is
evaluated using the Area Under the Curve (AUC) as well as RI-specific metrics
such as Kickout and a novel metric introduced in this work, denoted as Area
under the Kickout. Our findings reveal that RI methods, including the proposed
framework, generally involve a trade-off between AUC and RI-specific metrics.
However, the proposed CI-EX framework consistently outperforms existing RI
models from the credit literature in terms of RI-specific metrics while
maintaining competitive performance in AUC across most experiments.

*Eric Yeats,Aaron Jacobson,Darryl Hannan,Yiran Jia,Timothy Doster,Henry Kvinge,Scott Mahan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出使用去噪分数匹配损失作为局部内在维度(LID)的估计器，该方法比现有方法更高效且可扩展。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LID估计方法需要多次前向传播或梯度计算，在计算和内存受限场景下适用性有限。

Method: 证明LID是去噪分数匹配损失的下界，将其作为LID估计器，并与隐式分数匹配损失和FLIPD方法建立联系。

Result: 在流形基准测试和Stable Diffusion 3.5上的实验表明，该方法在准确性和内存占用方面优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 去噪分数匹配损失是一种高效且可扩展的LID估计器，适用于大规模和高量化级别场景。

Abstract: The local intrinsic dimension (LID) of data is a fundamental quantity in
signal processing and learning theory, but quantifying the LID of
high-dimensional, complex data has been a historically challenging task. Recent
works have discovered that diffusion models capture the LID of data through the
spectra of their score estimates and through the rate of change of their
density estimates under various noise perturbations. While these methods can
accurately quantify LID, they require either many forward passes of the
diffusion model or use of gradient computation, limiting their applicability in
compute- and memory-constrained scenarios.
  We show that the LID is a lower bound on the denoising score matching loss,
motivating use of the denoising score matching loss as a LID estimator.
Moreover, we show that the equivalent implicit score matching loss also
approximates LID via the normal dimension and is closely related to a recent
LID estimator, FLIPD. Our experiments on a manifold benchmark and with Stable
Diffusion 3.5 indicate that the denoising score matching loss is a highly
competitive and scalable LID estimator, achieving superior accuracy and memory
footprint under increasing problem size and quantization level.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了FADE指标，通过比较未学习模型和参考模型在生成样本上的双向似然分配来评估分布相似性，解决了现有遗忘指标依赖特定参考的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前生成模型的遗忘指标基于参考响应或分类器输出评估，而非核心目标：未学习模型是否与从未见过不需要数据的模型行为无法区分。这种参考特定方法存在系统性盲点。

Method: 提出功能对齐分布等价性(FADE)指标，通过比较未学习模型和参考模型在生成样本上的双向似然分配来测量分布相似性，捕获整个输出分布的功能对齐。

Result: 在TOFU和UnlearnCanvas基准测试中，传统指标接近最优的方法未能实现分布等价性，许多模型在遗忘后反而与黄金标准更远。

Conclusion: 当前评估实践存在根本性差距，FADE为开发和评估真正有效的遗忘方法提供了更稳健的基础。

Abstract: Current unlearning metrics for generative models evaluate success based on
reference responses or classifier outputs rather than assessing the core
objective: whether the unlearned model behaves indistinguishably from a model
that never saw the unwanted data. This reference-specific approach creates
systematic blind spots, allowing models to appear successful while retaining
unwanted knowledge accessible through alternative prompts or attacks. We
address these limitations by proposing Functional Alignment for Distributional
Equivalence (FADE), a novel metric that measures distributional similarity
between unlearned and reference models by comparing bidirectional likelihood
assignments over generated samples. Unlike existing approaches that rely on
predetermined references, FADE captures functional alignment across the entire
output distribution, providing a principled assessment of genuine unlearning.
Our experiments on the TOFU benchmark for LLM unlearning and the UnlearnCanvas
benchmark for text-to-image diffusion model unlearning reveal that methods
achieving near-optimal scores on traditional metrics fail to achieve
distributional equivalence, with many becoming more distant from the gold
standard than before unlearning. These findings expose fundamental gaps in
current evaluation practices and demonstrate that FADE provides a more robust
foundation for developing and assessing truly effective unlearning methods.

TL;DR: CSI-4CAST是一个用于大规模MIMO系统CSI预测的混合深度学习架构，集成了CNN残差、自适应校正层、ShuffleNet块和Transformer，在计算效率显著提升的同时实现了优越的预测精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习方法在应对实际非高斯噪声、跨信道条件泛化能力和计算效率方面存在局限，需要开发更鲁棒高效的CSI预测方法。

Method: 提出混合深度学习架构CSI-4CAST，整合卷积神经网络残差、自适应校正层、ShuffleNet块和Transformer，有效捕捉CSI预测中的局部和长程依赖关系。

Result: 在TDD场景中88.9%和FDD场景中43.8%的情况下超越基线模型，计算量相比最强基线LLM4CP减少5倍和3倍，同时建立了包含30万样本的CSI-RRG基准数据集。

Conclusion: CSI-4CAST在CSI预测任务中实现了精度和效率的平衡，建立的标准化基准将促进鲁棒高效CSI预测的进一步研究。

Abstract: Channel state information (CSI) prediction is a promising strategy for
ensuring reliable and efficient operation of massive multiple-input
multiple-output (mMIMO) systems by providing timely downlink (DL) CSI. While
deep learning-based methods have advanced beyond conventional model-driven and
statistical approaches, they remain limited in robustness to practical
non-Gaussian noise, generalization across diverse channel conditions, and
computational efficiency. This paper introduces CSI-4CAST, a hybrid deep
learning architecture that integrates 4 key components, i.e., Convolutional
neural network residuals, Adaptive correction layers, ShuffleNet blocks, and
Transformers, to efficiently capture both local and long-range dependencies in
CSI prediction. To enable rigorous evaluation, this work further presents a
comprehensive benchmark, CSI-RRG for Regular, Robustness and Generalization
testing, which includes more than 300,000 samples across 3,060 realistic
scenarios for both TDD and FDD systems. The dataset spans multiple channel
models, a wide range of delay spreads and user velocities, and diverse noise
types and intensity degrees. Experimental results show that CSI-4CAST achieves
superior prediction accuracy with substantially lower computational cost,
outperforming baselines in 88.9% of TDD scenarios and 43.8% of FDD scenario,
the best performance among all evaluated models, while reducing FLOPs by 5x and
3x compared to LLM4CP, the strongest baseline. In addition, evaluation over
CSI-RRG provides valuable insights into how different channel factors affect
the performance and generalization capability of deep learning models. Both the
dataset (https://huggingface.co/CSI-4CAST) and evaluation protocols
(https://github.com/AI4OPT/CSI-4CAST) are publicly released to establish a
standardized benchmark and to encourage further research on robust and
efficient CSI prediction.

Abstract: Test-time scaling has enabled Large Language Models (LLMs) with remarkable
reasoning capabilities, particularly in mathematical domains, through
intermediate chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning before generating final answers.
However, the specific sources and mechanisms underlying these reasoning
capabilities remain insufficiently understood. Optimization reasoning, i.e.
finding extrema under constraints, represents a fundamental abstraction that
underpins critical applications in planning, control, resource allocation, and
prompt search. To systematically evaluate this capability, we introduce
ExtremBench, a benchmark dataset for solving mathematical extremal problems,
curated from inequality exercises used for Chinese Mathematical Olympiad and
transformed into $93$ standardized extrema-finding problems. We conduct
extensive evaluations across various state-of-the-art open-source model
families, including the Qwen3, GPT-OSS, and DeepSeek. Our results reveal that
LLMs' extremal-solving reasoning capabilities do not always align with those of
current mathematical benchmarks such as AIME25 and MATH-500, with some models
showing strong general mathematical reasoning but poor extremal-solving skills,
and vice versa. This discrepancy highlights a critical gap in current
evaluation practices and suggests that existing benchmarks may not
comprehensively capture the full spectrum of mathematical reasoning abilities.

Motivation: 刚性系统的时间积分在燃烧、高超声速等反应输运系统中是主要计算成本来源，需要开发能够缓解刚性挑战的可靠算子学习策略。

Method: 开发AMORE框架，包含多输出算子网络和自适应损失函数，采用两步训练方法，通过可逆解析映射确保质量分数约束，并扩展自适应损失函数到主干和分支训练。

Conclusion: AMORE是一个通用框架，所提出的DeepONet将成为未来CFD研究中加速湍流燃烧模拟的基础，该框架也可应用于FNO等其他算子。

Abstract: Time integration of stiff systems is a primary source of computational cost
in combustion, hypersonics, and other reactive transport systems. This
stiffness can introduce time scales significantly smaller than those associated
with other physical processes, requiring extremely small time steps in explicit
schemes or computationally intensive implicit methods. Consequently, strategies
to alleviate challenges posed by stiffness are important. While neural
operators (DeepONets) can act as surrogates for stiff kinetics, a reliable
operator learning strategy is required to appropriately account for differences
in the error between output variables and samples. Here, we develop AMORE,
Adaptive Multi-Output Operator Network, a framework comprising an operator
capable of predicting multiple outputs and adaptive loss functions ensuring
reliable operator learning. The operator predicts all thermochemical states
from given initial conditions. We propose two adaptive loss functions within
the framework, considering each state variable's and sample's error to penalize
the loss function. We designed the trunk to automatically satisfy Partition of
Unity. To enforce unity mass-fraction constraint exactly, we propose an
invertible analytical map that transforms the $n$-dimensional species
mass-fraction vector into an ($n-1$)-dimensional space, where DeepONet training
is performed. We consider two-step training for DeepONet for multiple outputs
and extend adaptive loss functions for trunk and branch training. We
demonstrate the efficacy and applicability of our models through two examples:
the syngas (12 states) and GRI-Mech 3.0 (24 active states out of 54). The
proposed DeepONet will be a backbone for future CFD studies to accelerate
turbulent combustion simulations. AMORE is a general framework, and here, in
addition to DeepONet, we also demonstrate it for FNO.

Conclusion: 提出的多阶段强化学习算法通过精心设计的初始化策略，有效解决了单细胞扰动建模中的局部最优问题，为细胞命运决策提供了更准确的预测

Abstract: Modeling cellular responses to genetic and chemical perturbations remains a
central challenge in single-cell biology. Existing data-driven framework have
advanced perturbation prediction through variational autoencoders, chemically
conditioned autoencoders, and large-scale transformer pretraining. However,
these models are prone to local optima in the nonconvex Waddington landscape of
cell fate decisions, where poor initialization can trap trajectories in
spurious lineages or implausible differentiation outcomes. While executable
gene regulatory networks complement these approaches, automated design
frameworks incorporate biological priors through multi-agent optimization. Yet,
an approach that is completely data-driven with well-designed initialization to
escape local optima and converge to a proper lineage remains elusive. In this
work, we introduce a multistage reinforcement learning algorithm tailored for
single-cell perturbation modeling. We first compute an explicit natural
gradient update using Fisher-vector products and a conjugate gradient solver,
scaled by a KL trust-region constraint to provide a safe, curvature-aware the
first step for the policy. Starting with these preconditioned parameters, we
then apply a second phase of proximal policy optimization (PPO) with clipped
surrogates, exploiting minibatch efficiency to refine the policy. We
demonstrate that this initialization substantially improves generalization on
Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and Single-cell ATAC sequencing
(scATAC-seq) pertubation analysis.

Motivation: 自动化超声焊缝检测面临训练数据有限和环境噪声干扰的挑战，在工业环境中实现端到端机器学习工作流一直难以实现。

Result: 该集成框架为真实数据上的自动化焊缝检测提供了端到端解决方案。

Conclusion: 该方法成功解决了焊缝检测中的数据稀缺和噪声问题，为工业环境中的自动化检测提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Automated ultrasonic weld inspection remains a significant challenge in the
nondestructive evaluation (NDE) community to factors such as limited training
data (due to the complexity of curating experimental specimens or high-fidelity
simulations) and environmental volatility of many industrial settings
(resulting in the corruption of on-the-fly measurements). Thus, an end-to-end
machine learning (ML) workflow for acoustic weld inspection in realistic (i.e.,
industrial) settings has remained an elusive goal. This work addresses the
challenges of data curation and signal corruption by proposing workflow
consisting of a reduced-order modeling scheme, diffusion based distribution
alignment, and U-Net-based segmentation and inversion. A reduced-order
Helmholtz model based on Lamb wave theory is used to generate a comprehensive
dataset over varying weld heterogeneity and crack defects. The relatively
inexpensive low-order solutions provide a robust training dateset for inversion
models which are refined through a transfer learning stage using a limited set
of full 3D elastodynamic simulations. To handle out-of-distribution (OOD)
real-world measurements with varying and unpredictable noise distributions,
i.e., Laser Doppler Vibrometry scans, guided diffusion produces in-distribution
representations of OOD experimental LDV scans which are subsequently processed
by the inversion models. This integrated framework provides an end-to-end
solution for automated weld inspection on real data.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于信息论的Koopman算子学习方法，通过平衡表示学习的简洁性和表达能力来解决传统方法中潜在空间崩溃的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Koopman算子的无限维特性使得寻找合适的有限维子空间具有挑战性，特别是在深度架构中。作者认为这些困难源于次优的表示学习，其中潜在变量未能平衡表达能力和简洁性。

Method: 提出了一种信息论拉格朗日公式，通过潜在互信息促进简洁性，通过冯·诺依曼熵维持表达能力，防止潜在空间崩溃。基于此提出了新算法来平衡这种权衡。

Result: 在多种动力系统上验证了该方法，相比现有Koopman学习方法表现出改进的性能，并可视化学习到的流形，观察到了与理论预测一致的实证结果。

Conclusion: 通过信息论框架平衡简洁性和表达能力，可以获得稳定且可解释的Koopman表示，在多个动力系统上优于现有方法。

Abstract: The Koopman operator provides a powerful framework for modeling dynamical
systems and has attracted growing interest from the machine learning community.
However, its infinite-dimensional nature makes identifying suitable
finite-dimensional subspaces challenging, especially for deep architectures. We
argue that these difficulties come from suboptimal representation learning,
where latent variables fail to balance expressivity and simplicity. This
tension is closely related to the information bottleneck (IB) dilemma:
constructing compressed representations that are both compact and predictive.
Rethinking Koopman learning through this lens, we demonstrate that latent
mutual information promotes simplicity, yet an overemphasis on simplicity may
cause latent space to collapse onto a few dominant modes. In contrast,
expressiveness is sustained by the von Neumann entropy, which prevents such
collapse and encourages mode diversity. This insight leads us to propose an
information-theoretic Lagrangian formulation that explicitly balances this
tradeoff. Furthermore, we propose a new algorithm based on the Lagrangian
formulation that encourages both simplicity and expressiveness, leading to a
stable and interpretable Koopman representation. Beyond quantitative
evaluations, we further visualize the learned manifolds under our
representations, observing empirical results consistent with our theoretical
predictions. Finally, we validate our approach across a diverse range of
dynamical systems, demonstrating improved performance over existing Koopman
learning methods. The implementation is publicly available at
https://github.com/Wenxuan52/InformationKoopman.

Motivation: 现有高分辨率操作模型在模拟极端事件和统计分布时存在持续偏差，而理想化模型虽然能精确描述特定动态特征，但受限于学科边界而孤立存在。需要整合不同复杂度模型的互补优势。

Method: 采用重新配置的潜在数据同化技术，构建桥接模型层次的可解释AI框架，利用理想化模型的稀疏输出，继承操作模型的高分辨率和全面变量。

Conclusion: 该框架超越了黑盒校正，提供了物理洞察，为有效的物理辅助数字孪生和不确定性量化奠定了基础，同时强调了推进理想化模型发展和建模社区间交流的重要性。

Abstract: Computer models are indispensable tools for understanding the Earth system.
While high-resolution operational models have achieved many successes, they
exhibit persistent biases, particularly in simulating extreme events and
statistical distributions. In contrast, coarse-grained idealized models isolate
fundamental processes and can be precisely calibrated to excel in
characterizing specific dynamical and statistical features. However, different
models remain siloed by disciplinary boundaries. By leveraging the
complementary strengths of models of varying complexity, we develop an
explainable AI framework for Earth system emulators. It bridges the model
hierarchy through a reconfigured latent data assimilation technique, uniquely
suited to exploit the sparse output from the idealized models. The resulting
bridging model inherits the high resolution and comprehensive variables of
operational models while achieving global accuracy enhancements through
targeted improvements from idealized models. Crucially, the mechanism of AI
provides a clear rationale for these advancements, moving beyond black-box
correction to physically insightful understanding in a computationally
efficient framework that enables effective physics-assisted digital twins and
uncertainty quantification. We demonstrate its power by significantly
correcting biases in CMIP6 simulations of El Ni\~no spatiotemporal patterns,
leveraging statistically accurate idealized models. This work also highlights
the importance of pushing idealized model development and advancing
communication between modeling communities.

as Noise-Regularized Stochastic Gradient Descent (NRSGD). IAGD leverages
second-order Newton Interpolation to expedite the convergence process during

introduces controlled noise to the gradients during the optimization process.
Comparative experiments of this research are conducted on the CIFAR-10, and
CIFAR-100 datasets, benchmarking different CNNs(Convolutional Neural Networks)
with IAGD and NRSGD against classical optimizers in Keras Package. Results
demonstrate the potential of those two viable improvement methods in SGD,

Abstract: Precipitation nowcasting, which predicts rainfall up to a few hours ahead, is
a critical tool for vulnerable communities in the Global South frequently
exposed to intense, rapidly developing storms. Timely forecasts provide a
crucial window to protect lives and livelihoods. Traditional numerical weather
prediction (NWP) methods suffer from high latency, low spatial and temporal
resolution, and significant gaps in accuracy across the world. Recent machine
learning-based nowcasting methods, common in the Global North, cannot be
extended to the Global South due to extremely sparse radar coverage. We present
Global MetNet, an operational global machine learning nowcasting model. It
leverages the Global Precipitation Mission's CORRA dataset, geostationary
satellite data, and global NWP data to predict precipitation for the next 12
hours. The model operates at a high resolution of approximately 0.05{\deg}
(~5km) spatially and 15 minutes temporally. Global MetNet significantly
outperforms industry-standard hourly forecasts and achieves significantly
higher skill, making forecasts useful over a much larger area of the world than
previously available. Our model demonstrates better skill in data-sparse
regions than even the best high-resolution NWP models achieve in the US.
Validated using ground radar and satellite data, it shows significant
improvements across key metrics like the critical success index and fractions
skill score for all precipitation rates and lead times. Crucially, our model
generates forecasts in under a minute, making it readily deployable for
real-time applications. It is already deployed for millions of users on Google
Search. This work represents a key step in reducing global disparities in
forecast quality and integrating sparse, high-resolution satellite observations
into weather forecasting.

Motivation: 经典优化理论处理固定目标函数，而时变优化在动态环境决策中日益重要。本文旨在通过时变优化视角研究流数据学习问题。

Method: 引入基于权重的结构化公式，明确捕捉流数据的时变目标函数特性。分析均匀权重和折扣权重两种策略，在梯度下降更新下推导跟踪误差的紧致界限。

Result: 均匀权重下跟踪误差以O(1/t)速率渐近消失，折扣权重会产生非零误差下限，由折扣因子和每时间步梯度更新次数控制。数值模拟验证了理论发现。

Conclusion: 权重策略对跟踪误差有显著影响：均匀权重可实现渐近收敛，折扣权重存在误差下限但能更好地适应动态变化。

Abstract: Classical optimization theory deals with fixed, time-invariant objective
functions. However, time-varying optimization has emerged as an important
subject for decision-making in dynamic environments. In this work, we study the
problem of learning from streaming data through a time-varying optimization
lens. Unlike prior works that focus on generic formulations, we introduce a
structured, \emph{weight-based} formulation that explicitly captures the
streaming-data origin of the time-varying objective, where at each time step,
an agent aims to minimize a weighted average loss over all the past data
samples. We focus on two specific weighting strategies: (1) uniform weights,
which treat all samples equally, and (2) discounted weights, which
geometrically decay the influence of older data. For both schemes, we derive
tight bounds on the ``tracking error'' (TE), defined as the deviation between
the model parameter and the time-varying optimum at a given time step, under
gradient descent (GD) updates. We show that under uniform weighting, the TE
vanishes asymptotically with a $\mathcal{O}(1/t)$ decay rate, whereas
discounted weighting incurs a nonzero error floor controlled by the discount
factor and the number of gradient updates performed at each time step. Our
theoretical findings are validated through numerical simulations.

Motivation: 尽管KL正则化在强化学习对齐中取得显著经验成功，但其在博弈论环境中的理论优势仍不清楚。本文旨在填补这一理论空白。

Method: 针对矩阵博弈提出OMG算法（基于最佳响应采样和乐观奖励），针对马尔可夫博弈提出SOMG算法（使用最佳响应采样和超乐观奖励概念）。

Result: 两种算法都实现了对数级后悔O(log T)，且后悔随KL正则化强度β的增大而减小，同时保持标准的O(√T)后悔界。

Conclusion: KL正则化在博弈论环境中确实能带来理论优势，显著提高样本效率，特别是在强正则化情况下效果更佳。

Abstract: Reverse Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence-based regularization with respect to
a fixed reference policy is widely used in modern reinforcement learning to
preserve the desired traits of the reference policy and sometimes to promote
exploration (using uniform reference policy, known as entropy regularization).
Beyond serving as a mere anchor, the reference policy can also be interpreted
as encoding prior knowledge about good actions in the environment. In the
context of alignment, recent game-theoretic approaches have leveraged KL
regularization with pretrained language models as reference policies, achieving
notable empirical success in self-play methods. Despite these advances, the
theoretical benefits of KL regularization in game-theoretic settings remain
poorly understood. In this work, we develop and analyze algorithms that
provably achieve improved sample efficiency under KL regularization. We study
both two-player zero-sum Matrix games and Markov games: for Matrix games, we
propose OMG, an algorithm based on best response sampling with optimistic
bonuses, and extend this idea to Markov games through the algorithm SOMG, which
also uses best response sampling and a novel concept of superoptimistic
bonuses. Both algorithms achieve a logarithmic regret in $T$ that scales
inversely with the KL regularization strength $\beta$ in addition to the
standard $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(\sqrt{T})$ regret independent of $\beta$
which is attained in both regularized and unregularized settings

Conclusion: 提出的紧密度和分离性指数能够有效识别真正的簇数量，为聚类分析提供了新的绝对评估工具。

Abstract: Finding "true" clusters in a data set is a challenging problem. Clustering
solutions obtained using different models and algorithms do not necessarily
provide compact and well-separated clusters or the optimal number of clusters.
Cluster validity indices are commonly applied to identify such clusters.
Nevertheless, these indices are typically relative, and they are used to
compare clustering algorithms or choose the parameters of a clustering
algorithm. Moreover, the success of these indices depends on the underlying
data structure. This paper introduces novel absolute cluster indices to
determine both the compactness and separability of clusters. We define a
compactness function for each cluster and a set of neighboring points for
cluster pairs. This function is utilized to determine the compactness of each
cluster and the whole cluster distribution. The set of neighboring points is
used to define the margin between clusters and the overall distribution margin.
The proposed compactness and separability indices are applied to identify the
true number of clusters. Using a number of synthetic and real-world data sets,
we demonstrate the performance of these new indices and compare them with other
widely-used cluster validity indices.

Conclusion: NeuroRVQ标记器为脑电信号处理提供了高效的压缩和准确重建能力，推动了神经解码、生成建模和多模态生物信号集成的发展。

Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) captures neural activity across multiple
temporal and spectral scales, yielding signals that are rich but complex for
representation learning. Recently, EEG foundation models trained to predict
masked signal-tokens have shown promise for learning generalizable
representations. However, their performance is hindered by their signal
tokenization modules. Existing neural tokenizers fail to preserve
high-frequency dynamics, limiting their ability to reconstruct EEG signals with
high fidelity. We introduce NeuroRVQ, a scalable Large Brainwave Model (LBM)
centered on a codebook-based tokenizer. Our tokenizer integrates: (i)
multi-scale feature extraction modules that capture the full frequency neural
spectrum; (ii) hierarchical residual vector quantization (RVQ) codebooks for
high-resolution encoding; and, (iii) an EEG signal phase- and amplitude-aware
loss function for efficient training. This design enables efficient EEG
compression while supporting accurate reconstruction across all frequency
bands, leading to robust generative masked modeling. Our empirical results
demonstrate that NeuroRVQ achieves lower reconstruction error and outperforms
existing LBMs on a variety of downstream tasks. More broadly, NeuroRVQ
tokenizer establishes a strong prior for codebook-based general-purpose
brainwave models, enabling advances in neural decoding, generative modeling and
multimodal biosignal integration.

Abstract: We develop an unsupervised deep learning framework for downlink beamforming
in large-scale MU-MISO channels. The model is trained offline, allowing
real-time inference through lightweight feedforward computations in dynamic
communication environments. Following the learning-to-optimize (L2O) paradigm,
a multi-layer Transformer iteratively refines both channel and beamformer
features via residual connections. To enhance training, three strategies are
introduced: (i) curriculum learning (CL) to improve early-stage convergence and
avoid local optima, (ii) semi-amortized learning to refine each Transformer
block with a few gradient ascent steps, and (iii) sliding-window training to
stabilize optimization by training only a subset of Transformer blocks at a
time. Extensive simulations show that the proposed scheme outperforms existing
baselines at low-to-medium SNRs and closely approaches WMMSE performance at
high SNRs, while achieving substantially faster inference than iterative and
online learning approaches.

  DeepCausalMMM is a Python package that addresses these limitations by
combining deep learning, causal inference, and advanced marketing science. The
package uses Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs) to automatically learn temporal
patterns such as adstock (carryover effects) and lag, while simultaneously
learning statistical dependencies and potential causal structures between
marketing channels through Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) learning
[@Zheng2018NOTEARS; @Gong2024CausalMMM]. Additionally, it implements Hill
equation-based saturation curves to model diminishing returns and optimize
budget allocation.
  Key innovations include: (1) a data-driven design where hyperparameters and
transformations (e.g., adstock decay, saturation curves) are learned or
estimated from data with sensible defaults, rather than requiring fixed
heuristics or manual specification, (2) multi-region modeling with both shared
and region-specific parameters, (3) robust statistical methods including Huber
loss and advanced regularization, (4) comprehensive response curve analysis for
understanding channel saturation, and (5) an extensive visualization suite with
14+ interactive dashboards for business insights.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了稀疏三角传输映射方法，利用周期性边界条件下晶格图的条件独立结构，通过单调整流神经网络解决晶格场理论采样中的多模态和长程相关性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 晶格场理论是计算物理学的重要测试平台，但其玻尔兹曼分布采样面临多模态和长程相关的挑战。归一化流虽然是有前景的替代方法，但在大晶格上的应用受到内存需求和模型表达能力限制。

Method: 使用稀疏三角传输映射，利用晶格图的条件独立结构，通过单调整流神经网络实现。该方法在精确稀疏性（尊重目标分布的边际条件独立性）和近似稀疏性（无填充的计算可行性）之间取得平衡。

Conclusion: 提出的方法在计算复杂度和表达能力之间取得了良好平衡，为大规模晶格场理论采样提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Lattice field theories are fundamental testbeds for computational physics;
yet, sampling their Boltzmann distributions remains challenging due to
multimodality and long-range correlations. While normalizing flows offer a
promising alternative, their application to large lattices is often constrained
by prohibitive memory requirements and the challenge of maintaining sufficient
model expressivity. We propose sparse triangular transport maps that explicitly
exploit the conditional independence structure of the lattice graph under
periodic boundary conditions using monotone rectified neural networks (MRNN).
We introduce a comprehensive framework for triangular transport maps that
navigates the fundamental trade-off between \emph{exact sparsity} (respecting
marginal conditional independence in the target distribution) and
\emph{approximate sparsity} (computational tractability without fill-ins).
Restricting each triangular map component to a local past enables site-wise
parallel evaluation and linear time complexity in lattice size $N$, while
preserving the expressive, invertible structure. Using $\phi^4$ in two
dimensions as a controlled setting, we analyze how node labelings (orderings)
affect the sparsity and performance of triangular maps. We compare against
Hybrid Monte Carlo (HMC) and established flow approaches (RealNVP).

Abstract: Masked diffusion models (MDMs) for text offer a compelling alternative to
traditional autoregressive language models. Parallel generation makes them
efficient, but their computational capabilities and the limitations inherent to
their parallelism remain largely unexplored. To this end, we characterize what
types of reasoning problems MDMs can provably solve and how efficiently. We do
this by connecting MDMs to the well-understood reasoning frameworks of chain of
thought (CoT) and padded looped transformers (PLTs) in the finite-precision
log-width setting: We show that MDMs and polynomially-padded PLTs are, in fact,
equivalent in this setting, and that MDMs can solve all problems that
CoT-augmented transformers can. Moreover, we showcase classes of problems
(including regular languages) for which MDMs are inherently more efficient than
CoT transformers, where parallel generation allows for substantially faster
reasoning.

Conclusion: CoDa-FL框架通过聚类导向和依赖感知的方法，有效优化了联邦学习在移动边缘计算环境中的性能表现。

Abstract: We study the client selection problem in Federated Learning (FL) within
mobile edge computing (MEC) environments, particularly under the dependent
multi-task settings, to reduce the total time required to complete various
learning tasks. We propose CoDa-FL, a Cluster-oriented and Dependency-aware
framework designed to reduce the total required time via cluster-based client
selection and dependent task assignment. Our approach considers Earth Mover's
Distance (EMD) for client clustering based on their local data distributions to
lower computational cost and improve communication efficiency. We derive a
direct and explicit relationship between intra-cluster EMD and the number of
training rounds required for convergence, thereby simplifying the otherwise
complex process of obtaining the optimal solution. Additionally, we incorporate
a directed acyclic graph-based task scheduling mechanism to effectively manage
task dependencies. Through numerical experiments, we validate that our proposed
CoDa-FL outperforms existing benchmarks by achieving faster convergence, lower
communication and computational costs, and higher learning accuracy under
heterogeneous MEC settings.

Conclusion: 提出的方法成功将dropout扩展到连续时间模型，提供了理论保证和实际性能优势，为连续时间深度学习提供了有效的正则化工具。

Abstract: We study dropout regularization in continuous-time models through the lens of
random-batch methods -- a family of stochastic sampling schemes originally
devised to reduce the computational cost of interacting particle systems. We
construct an unbiased, well-posed estimator that mimics dropout by sampling
neuron batches over time intervals of length $h$. Trajectory-wise convergence
is established with linear rate in $h$ for the expected uniform error. At the
distribution level, we establish stability for the associated continuity
equation, with total-variation error of order $h^{1/2}$ under mild moment
assumptions. During training with fixed batch sampling across epochs, a
Pontryagin-based adjoint analysis bounds deviations in the optimal cost and
control, as well as in gradient-descent iterates. On the design side, we
compare convergence rates for canonical batch sampling schemes, recover
standard Bernoulli dropout as a special case, and derive a cost--accuracy
trade-off yielding a closed-form optimal $h$. We then specialize to a
single-layer neural ODE and validate the theory on classification and flow
matching, observing the predicted rates, regularization effects, and favorable
runtime and memory profiles.

Motivation: 现有程序表示方法存在两难：静态表示高效但无法反映程序在代码变换下的行为，动态表示能洞察性能瓶颈但开销大且非确定性。需要超越这种权衡。

Method: 使用程序行为谱表示，通过用多样化优化序列探测程序IR并量化静态特征变化。采用产品量化将连续反应向量离散化，然后用多任务Transformer模型PQ-BERT学习行为代码的上下文语法。

Result: 在两个代表性编译器优化任务（最佳通道预测和-Oz收益预测）上的综合实验表明，该方法优于最先进的静态基线方法。

Conclusion: 提出的准动态框架成功超越了静态和动态表示之间的权衡，为程序表示提供了新的有效方法。

Abstract: Learning effective numerical representations, or embeddings, of programs is a
fundamental prerequisite for applying machine learning to automate and enhance
compiler optimization. Prevailing paradigms, however, present a dilemma. Static
representations, derived from source code or intermediate representation (IR),
are efficient and deterministic but offer limited insight into how a program
will behave or evolve under complex code transformations. Conversely, dynamic
representations, which rely on runtime profiling, provide profound insights
into performance bottlenecks but are often impractical for large-scale tasks
due to prohibitive overhead and inherent non-determinism. This paper transcends
this trade-off by proposing a novel quasi-dynamic framework for program
representation. The core insight is to model a program's optimization
sensitivity. We introduce the Program Behavior Spectrum, a new representation
generated by probing a program's IR with a diverse set of optimization
sequences and quantifying the resulting changes in its static features. To
effectively encode this high-dimensional, continuous spectrum, we pioneer a
compositional learning approach. Product Quantization is employed to discretize
the continuous reaction vectors into structured, compositional sub-words.
Subsequently, a multi-task Transformer model, termed PQ-BERT, is pre-trained to
learn the deep contextual grammar of these behavioral codes. Comprehensive
experiments on two representative compiler optimization tasks -- Best Pass
Prediction and -Oz Benefit Prediction -- demonstrate that our method
outperforms state-of-the-art static baselines. Our code is publicly available
at https://github.com/Panhaolin2001/PREP/.

Conclusion: 该框架为构建完备等变GNNs提供了理论依据和实用方法，在保持强大实用效能的同时大幅减少计算负担。

Abstract: Equivariant Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated significant
success across various applications. To achieve completeness -- that is, the
universal approximation property over the space of equivariant functions -- the
network must effectively capture the intricate multi-body interactions among
different nodes. Prior methods attain this via deeper architectures, augmented
body orders, or increased degrees of steerable features, often at high
computational cost and without polynomial-time solutions. In this work, we
present a theoretically grounded framework for constructing complete
equivariant GNNs that is both efficient and practical. We prove that a complete
equivariant GNN can be achieved through two key components: 1) a complete
scalar function, referred to as the canonical form of the geometric graph; and
2) a full-rank steerable basis set. Leveraging this finding, we propose an
efficient algorithm for constructing complete equivariant GNNs based on two
common models: EGNN and TFN. Empirical results demonstrate that our model
demonstrates superior completeness and excellent performance with only a few
layers, thereby significantly reducing computational overhead while maintaining
strong practical efficacy.

Result: 理论分析和实证研究都证实了CCH的有效性，为理解跨模态知识蒸馏提供了理论基础。

Conclusion: 本研究建立了跨模态知识蒸馏的新理论框架，并基于CCH准则提供了选择最优教师模态以提升较弱模态性能的实用指南。

Abstract: The rapid increase in multimodal data availability has sparked significant
interest in cross-modal knowledge distillation (KD) techniques, where richer
"teacher" modalities transfer information to weaker "student" modalities during
model training to improve performance. However, despite successes across
various applications, cross-modal KD does not always result in improved
outcomes, primarily due to a limited theoretical understanding that could
inform practice. To address this gap, we introduce the Cross-modal
Complementarity Hypothesis (CCH): we propose that cross-modal KD is effective
when the mutual information between teacher and student representations exceeds
the mutual information between the student representation and the labels. We
theoretically validate the CCH in a joint Gaussian model and further confirm it
empirically across diverse multimodal datasets, including image, text, video,
audio, and cancer-related omics data. Our study establishes a novel theoretical
framework for understanding cross-modal KD and offers practical guidelines
based on the CCH criterion to select optimal teacher modalities for improving
the performance of weaker modalities.

TL;DR: CleverCatch是一个知识引导的弱监督模型，通过将结构化领域专业知识整合到神经网络架构中，在共享嵌入空间中对齐规则和数据样本，提高了医疗欺诈检测的准确性和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医疗欺诈检测面临标签数据稀缺、欺诈手段不断演变以及医疗记录高维度的挑战。传统监督方法受限于极端标签稀缺，而纯无监督方法往往无法捕捉临床意义上的异常。

Method: 在共享嵌入空间中训练编码器，将领域专家规则和数据样本对齐。通过合成代表合规和违规的数据进行联合训练，学习能够泛化到复杂真实数据集的软规则嵌入。

Result: 在大型真实数据集上的实验表明，CleverCatch优于四种最先进的异常检测基线方法，AUC平均提高1.3%，召回率平均提高3.4%。

Conclusion: 将专家规则嵌入学习过程不仅能提高检测准确性，还能增加透明度，为医疗欺诈检测等高风险领域提供可解释的方法。

Abstract: Healthcare fraud detection remains a critical challenge due to limited
availability of labeled data, constantly evolving fraud tactics, and the high
dimensionality of medical records. Traditional supervised methods are
challenged by extreme label scarcity, while purely unsupervised approaches
often fail to capture clinically meaningful anomalies. In this work, we
introduce CleverCatch, a knowledge-guided weak supervision model designed to
detect fraudulent prescription behaviors with improved accuracy and
interpretability. Our approach integrates structured domain expertise into a
neural architecture that aligns rules and data samples within a shared
embedding space. By training encoders jointly on synthetic data representing
both compliance and violation, CleverCatch learns soft rule embeddings that
generalize to complex, real-world datasets. This hybrid design enables
data-driven learning to be enhanced by domain-informed constraints, bridging
the gap between expert heuristics and machine learning. Experiments on the
large-scale real-world dataset demonstrate that CleverCatch outperforms four
state-of-the-art anomaly detection baselines, yielding average improvements of
1.3\% in AUC and 3.4\% in recall. Our ablation study further highlights the
complementary role of expert rules, confirming the adaptability of the
framework. The results suggest that embedding expert rules into the learning
process not only improves detection accuracy but also increases transparency,
offering an interpretable approach for high-stakes domains such as healthcare
fraud detection.

TL;DR: 比较Ising({-1,+1})和QUBO({0,1})编码在玻尔兹曼机学习中的表现，发现QUBO编码会导致Fisher信息矩阵条件数更差，使随机梯度下降收敛更慢，而自然梯度下降对两种编码表现相似。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究不同变量编码对玻尔兹曼机学习动态的影响，特别是Ising和QUBO编码在信息几何和收敛速度方面的差异。

Method: 在固定模型、采样器和步长的控制协议下，利用Fisher信息矩阵等于充分统计量协方差的特性，可视化模型样本的经验矩，分析两种编码的系统性差异。

Result: QUBO编码在一阶和二阶统计量之间产生更大的交叉项，导致Fisher信息矩阵有更多小特征值方向，降低谱熵，这种病态条件数解释了随机梯度下降收敛较慢的原因。

Conclusion: 对于基于SGD的训练，Ising编码提供更各向同性的曲率和更快收敛；对于QUBO编码，中心化/缩放或NGD式预处理可以缓解曲率病态问题。

Abstract: We compare Ising ({-1,+1}) and QUBO ({0,1}) encodings for Boltzmann machine
learning under a controlled protocol that fixes the model, sampler, and step
size. Exploiting the identity that the Fisher information matrix (FIM) equals
the covariance of sufficient statistics, we visualize empirical moments from
model samples and reveal systematic, representation-dependent differences. QUBO
induces larger cross terms between first- and second-order statistics, creating
more small-eigenvalue directions in the FIM and lowering spectral entropy. This
ill-conditioning explains slower convergence under stochastic gradient descent
(SGD). In contrast, natural gradient descent (NGD)-which rescales updates by
the FIM metric-achieves similar convergence across encodings due to
reparameterization invariance. Practically, for SGD-based training, the Ising
encoding provides more isotropic curvature and faster convergence; for QUBO,
centering/scaling or NGD-style preconditioning mitigates curvature pathologies.
These results clarify how representation shapes information geometry and
finite-time learning dynamics in Boltzmann machines and yield actionable
guidelines for variable encoding and preprocessing.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究通常使用外部奖励模型或现成LLM预处理原始训练数据集来识别有价值的偏好对，但很少检查单个数据点是否真正有益。

Method: 提出截断影响函数(TIF)评估数据质量，开发两种计算更简单的评分函数(SF)，并通过组合它们来抵消不同的误差源。

Result: 实验表明，使用更少的数据可以实现更好的对齐性能，证明了方法的通用性。

Conclusion: 偏好数据质量是模型相关的，需要针对特定模型改进数据选择方法，提出的数据选择规则能够更精确地选择有价值的偏好数据。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) alignment is typically achieved through learning
from human preference comparisons, making the quality of preference data
critical to its success. Existing studies often pre-process raw training
datasets to identify valuable preference pairs using external reward models or
off-the-shelf LLMs, achieving improved overall performance but rarely examining
whether individual, selected data point is genuinely beneficial. We assess data
quality through individual influence on validation data using our newly
proposed truncated influence function (TIF), which mitigates the over-scoring
present in traditional measures and reveals that preference data quality is
inherently a property of the model. In other words, a data pair that benefits
one model may harm another. This leaves the need to improve the preference data
selection approaches to be adapting to specific models. To this end, we
introduce two candidate scoring functions (SFs) that are computationally
simpler than TIF and positively correlated with it. They are also model
dependent and can serve as potential indicators of individual data quality for
preference data selection. Furthermore, we observe that these SFs inherently
exhibit errors when compared to TIF. To this end, we combine them to offset
their diverse error sources, resulting in a simple yet effective data selection
rule that enables the models to achieve a more precise selection of valuable
preference data. We conduct experiments across diverse alignment benchmarks and
various LLM families, with results demonstrating that better alignment
performance can be achieved using less data, showing the generality of our
findings and new methods.

Result: 大量实验表明，FracNet相比最先进方法有显著改进。

Conclusion: 通过频谱分析和对比学习的结合，FracNet能更好地理解领域偏移，在领域适应任务中表现出优越性能，并有严格的理论证明支持。

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) have achieved remarkable success in various
domains, yet they often struggle with domain adaptation due to significant
structural distribution shifts and insufficient exploration of transferable
patterns. One of the main reasons behind this is that traditional approaches do
not treat global and local patterns discriminatingly so that some local details
in the graph may be violated after multi-layer GNN. Our key insight is that
domain shifts can be better understood through spectral analysis, where
low-frequency components often encode domain-invariant global patterns, and
high-frequency components capture domain-specific local details. As such, we
propose FracNet (\underline{\textbf{Fr}}equency \underline{\textbf{A}}ware
\underline{\textbf{C}}ontrastive Graph \underline{\textbf{Net}}work) with two
synergic modules to decompose the original graph into high-frequency and
low-frequency components and perform frequency-aware domain adaption. Moreover,
the blurring boundary problem of domain adaptation is improved by integrating
with a contrastive learning framework. Besides the practical implication, we
also provide rigorous theoretical proof to demonstrate the superiority of
FracNet. Extensive experiments further demonstrate significant improvements
over state-of-the-art approaches.

Motivation: 现有联邦学习框架（水平FL和垂直FL）只能在理想设置下有效工作，无法处理现实世界中客户端既不具备所有模态也不具备所有样本的异构数据场景。

Method: 提出BlendFL框架，无缝融合水平和垂直FL原则，支持客户端根据可用数据集灵活选择参与方式；引入去中心化推理机制和BlendAvg自适应全局模型聚合策略。

Conclusion: BlendFL在处理多模态数据异构性方面具有巨大潜力，特别适用于医疗和金融等数据隐私至关重要的现实世界协作学习场景。

Abstract: One of the key challenges of collaborative machine learning, without data
sharing, is multimodal data heterogeneity in real-world settings. While
Federated Learning (FL) enables model training across multiple clients,
existing frameworks, such as horizontal and vertical FL, are only effective in
`ideal' settings that meet specific assumptions. Hence, they struggle to
address scenarios where neither all modalities nor all samples are represented
across the participating clients. To address this gap, we propose BlendFL, a
novel FL framework that seamlessly blends the principles of horizontal and
vertical FL in a synchronized and non-restrictive fashion despite the asymmetry
across clients. Specifically, any client within BlendFL can benefit from either
of the approaches, or both simultaneously, according to its available dataset.
In addition, BlendFL features a decentralized inference mechanism, empowering
clients to run collaboratively trained local models using available local data,
thereby reducing latency and reliance on central servers for inference. We also
introduce BlendAvg, an adaptive global model aggregation strategy that
prioritizes collaborative model updates based on each client's performance. We
trained and evaluated BlendFL and other state-of-the-art baselines on three
classification tasks using a large-scale real-world multimodal medical dataset
and a popular multimodal benchmark. Our results highlight BlendFL's superior
performance for both multimodal and unimodal classification. Ablation studies
demonstrate BlendFL's faster convergence compared to traditional approaches,
accelerating collaborative learning. Overall, in our study we highlight the
potential of BlendFL for handling multimodal data heterogeneity for
collaborative learning in real-world settings where data privacy is crucial,
such as in healthcare and finance.

MERA addresses these limitations by (i) optimising the intervention direction,
and (ii) calibrating when, and how much to steer, thereby provably improving
performance or abstaining when no confident correction is possible. Experiments
across diverse datasets, and LM families demonstrate safe, effective,
non-degrading error correction, and that MERA outperforms existing baselines.
Moreover, MERA can be applied on top of existing steering techniques to further
enhance their performance, establishing it as a general-purpose, and efficient
approach to mechanistic activation steering.

*Rui Xu,Sihong Xie*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出Fed-CCP方法，通过生成模型实现联邦学习中的条件保形预测，解决客户端数据异构性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准保形预测假设数据独立同分布，但在联邦学习场景中客户端数据分布差异显著，现有方法只能保证边际覆盖，无法反映输入条件不确定性。

Method: 使用生成模型（如归一化流或扩散模型）近似条件数据分布，无需共享原始数据，让每个客户端本地校准反映其独特不确定性的保形分数，通过联邦聚合保持全局一致性。

Result: 在真实数据集上的实验表明，Fed-CCP能够实现更自适应的预测集。

Conclusion: Fed-CCP通过生成模型有效解决了联邦学习中数据异构性问题，实现了条件覆盖的保形预测。

Abstract: Conformal Prediction (CP) provides distribution-free uncertainty
quantification by constructing prediction sets that guarantee coverage of the
true labels. This reliability makes CP valuable for high-stakes federated
learning scenarios such as multi-center healthcare. However, standard CP
assumes i.i.d. data, which is violated in federated settings where client
distributions differ substantially. Existing federated CP methods address this
by maintaining marginal coverage on each client, but such guarantees often fail
to reflect input-conditional uncertainty. In this work, we propose Federated
Conditional Conformal Prediction (Fed-CCP) via generative models, which aims
for conditional coverage that adapts to local data heterogeneity. Fed-CCP
leverages generative models, such as normalizing flows or diffusion models, to
approximate conditional data distributions without requiring the sharing of raw
data. This enables each client to locally calibrate conformal scores that
reflect its unique uncertainty, while preserving global consistency through
federated aggregation. Experiments on real datasets demonstrate that Fed-CCP
achieves more adaptive prediction sets.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出将保形预测框架与生成扩散模型结合，通过后处理扩散模型的样本来获得条件分位数估计，从而改进动力降尺度中的网格点级不确定性量化，提供有限样本保证的预测区间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成扩散模型在动力降尺度任务中缺乏有限样本保证，导致预测过度自信和不确定性估计失准，这限制了其在业务应用中的可靠性。

Method: 在降尺度流程中增强保形预测框架，将扩散模型的样本后处理得到条件分位数估计，并整合到保形化分位数回归过程中，以获取具有有限样本边际有效性的局部自适应预测区间。

Result: 在意大利ERA5再分析数据的2公里网格降尺度实验中，该方法显著改进了网格点级不确定性估计的覆盖率和稳定性概率评分。

Conclusion: 保形化生成模型为高分辨率气象场的概率降尺度提供了更可信赖的解决方案，具有改善不确定性量化的潜力。

Abstract: Dynamical downscaling is crucial for deriving high-resolution meteorological
fields from coarse-scale simulations, enabling detailed analysis for critical
applications such as weather forecasting and renewable energy modeling.
Generative Diffusion models (DMs) have recently emerged as powerful data-driven
tools for this task, offering reconstruction fidelity and more scalable
sampling supporting uncertainty quantification. However, DMs lack finite-sample
guarantees against overconfident predictions, resulting in miscalibrated
grid-point-level uncertainty estimates hindering their reliability in
operational contexts. In this work, we tackle this issue by augmenting the
downscaling pipeline with a conformal prediction framework. Specifically, the
DM's samples are post-processed to derive conditional quantile estimates,
incorporated into a conformalized quantile regression procedure targeting
locally adaptive prediction intervals with finite-sample marginal validity. The
proposed approach is evaluated on ERA5 reanalysis data over Italy, downscaled
to a 2-km grid. Results demonstrate grid-point-level uncertainty estimates with
markedly improved coverage and stable probabilistic scores relative to the DM
baseline, highlighting the potential of conformalized generative models for
more trustworthy probabilistic downscaling to high-resolution meteorological
fields.

Motivation: 现有的无监督异常检测方法面临分布假设冲突、计算效率低和处理不同类型异常困难等基本挑战。

Method: ISER构建集成表示，其中超球体半径编码密度信息：较小半径表示密集区域，较大半径对应稀疏区域。引入基于相似性的评分方法，通过比较集成表示与理论异常参考模式来测量模式一致性。

Result: 在22个真实世界数据集上的综合实验表明，ISER在11种基线方法中表现出优越性能。

Conclusion: ISER通过使用超球体半径作为局部密度特征的代理，有效解决了现有异常检测方法的局限性，并在多个数据集上取得了优异的性能。

Abstract: Anomaly detection is a critical task in data mining and management with
applications spanning fraud detection, network security, and log monitoring.
Despite extensive research, existing unsupervised anomaly detection methods
still face fundamental challenges including conflicting distributional
assumptions, computational inefficiency, and difficulty handling different
anomaly types. To address these problems, we propose ISER (Isolation-based
Spherical Ensemble Representations) that extends existing isolation-based
methods by using hypersphere radii as proxies for local density characteristics
while maintaining linear time and constant space complexity. ISER constructs
ensemble representations where hypersphere radii encode density information:
smaller radii indicate dense regions while larger radii correspond to sparse
areas. We introduce a novel similarity-based scoring method that measures
pattern consistency by comparing ensemble representations against a theoretical
anomaly reference pattern. Additionally, we enhance the performance of
Isolation Forest by using ISER and adapting the scoring function to address
axis-parallel bias and local anomaly detection limitations. Comprehensive
experiments on 22 real-world datasets demonstrate ISER's superior performance
over 11 baseline methods.

TL;DR: RockNet是一种专为超低功耗硬件设计的TinyML方法，通过分布式学习和无线通信集成，在时间序列分类任务中实现最先进精度，无需离线预训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着机器学习在信息物理系统中的普及，需要从云端训练转向设备端训练以解决隐私和延迟问题，但超低功耗微控制器的有限计算资源使训练变得困难。

Method: 设计分布式学习方法，集成机器学习和无线通信，利用所有设备进行分布式训练，结合定制的无线多跳通信协议克服通信瓶颈。

Result: 在20个超低功耗设备的测试平台上，RockNet成功从零开始学习时间序列分类任务，准确率比最新的神经网络微控制器训练方法提高2倍，当从1个中心设备扩展到20个设备时，每个设备的内存、延迟和能耗降低高达90%。

Conclusion: 分布式机器学习、分布式计算和通信的紧密集成首次实现了在超低功耗硬件上以最先进精度进行训练。

Abstract: As Machine Learning (ML) becomes integral to Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS),
there is growing interest in shifting training from traditional cloud-based to
on-device processing (TinyML), for example, due to privacy and latency
concerns. However, CPS often comprise ultra-low-power microcontrollers, whose
limited compute resources make training challenging. This paper presents
RockNet, a new TinyML method tailored for ultra-low-power hardware that
achieves state-of-the-art accuracy in timeseries classification, such as fault
or malware detection, without requiring offline pretraining. By leveraging that
CPS consist of multiple devices, we design a distributed learning method that
integrates ML and wireless communication. RockNet leverages all devices for
distributed training of specialized compute efficient classifiers that need
minimal communication overhead for parallelization. Combined with tailored and
efficient wireless multi-hop communication protocols, our approach overcomes
the communication bottleneck that often occurs in distributed learning.
Hardware experiments on a testbed with 20 ultra-low-power devices demonstrate
RockNet's effectiveness. It successfully learns timeseries classification tasks
from scratch, surpassing the accuracy of the latest approach for neural network
microcontroller training by up to 2x. RockNet's distributed ML architecture
reduces memory, latency and energy consumption per device by up to 90 % when
scaling from one central device to 20 devices. Our results show that a tight
integration of distributed ML, distributed computing, and communication
enables, for the first time, training on ultra-low-power hardware with
state-of-the-art accuracy.

*Lina Alkarmi,Ziyuan Huang,Mingyan Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文研究在战略分类中引入弃权机制的影响，证明最优弃权策略能确保分类器效用不劣于无弃权情况，并能抑制代理人的操纵行为。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 算法决策系统易受战略操纵，而分类器弃权已被证明能提高准确性。本文探讨在战略分类环境中引入弃权机制如何影响战略代理人的响应以及主体应如何最优利用弃权。

Method: 使用Stackelberg博弈模型，主体作为分类器首先宣布决策策略，战略代理人随后操纵特征以获得期望结果。聚焦于二元分类器，代理人操纵可观察特征而非真实特征。

Result: 最优弃权策略确保主体效用在战略代理人存在时不劣于无弃权情况。弃权还能抑制操纵行为，使资质较差的代理人更难通过操纵获得正面结果。

Conclusion: 弃权是减少算法决策系统中战略行为负面影响的有价值工具，既能提高准确性，又能增加操纵成本。

Abstract: Algorithmic decision making is increasingly prevalent, but often vulnerable
to strategic manipulation by agents seeking a favorable outcome. Prior research
has shown that classifier abstention (allowing a classifier to decline making a
decision due to insufficient confidence) can significantly increase classifier
accuracy. This paper studies abstention within a strategic classification
context, exploring how its introduction impacts strategic agents' responses and
how principals should optimally leverage it. We model this interaction as a
Stackelberg game where a principal, acting as the classifier, first announces
its decision policy, and then strategic agents, acting as followers, manipulate
their features to receive a desired outcome. Here, we focus on binary
classifiers where agents manipulate observable features rather than their true
features, and show that optimal abstention ensures that the principal's utility
(or loss) is no worse than in a non-abstention setting, even in the presence of
strategic agents. We also show that beyond improving accuracy, abstention can
also serve as a deterrent to manipulation, making it costlier for agents,
especially those less qualified, to manipulate to achieve a positive outcome
when manipulation costs are significant enough to affect agent behavior. These
results highlight abstention as a valuable tool for reducing the negative
effects of strategic behavior in algorithmic decision making systems.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了ToSFiT方法，通过微调大型语言模型实现Thompson采样，避免了传统贝叶斯优化中昂贵的采集函数最大化过程，在多个任务上验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统贝叶斯优化在大规模非结构化离散空间中因缺乏梯度而面临采集函数最大化计算成本高的问题，需要一种更高效的替代方法。

Method: 基于Thompson采样的ToSFiT方法，直接参数化候选解获得最大奖励的概率，利用提示条件化的大型语言模型的先验知识，并通过在线微调逐步适应后验分布。

Result: 在FAQ响应优化、热稳定蛋白质搜索和量子电路设计三个任务上验证了方法有效性，在线微调显著提高了样本效率，对计算效率影响可忽略。

Conclusion: ToSFiT提供了一种可扩展的贝叶斯优化替代方案，通过精心适应后验最大概率原则实现了与标准Thompson采样相当的强理论保证。

Abstract: Bayesian optimization in large unstructured discrete spaces is often hindered
by the computational cost of maximizing acquisition functions due to the
absence of gradients. We propose a scalable alternative based on Thompson
sampling that eliminates the need for acquisition function maximization by
directly parameterizing the probability that a candidate yields the maximum
reward. Our approach, Thompson Sampling via Fine-Tuning (ToSFiT) leverages the
prior knowledge embedded in prompt-conditioned large language models, and
incrementally adapts them toward the posterior. Theoretically, we derive a
novel regret bound for a variational formulation of Thompson Sampling that
matches the strong guarantees of its standard counterpart. Our analysis reveals
the critical role of careful adaptation to the posterior probability of
maximality--a principle that underpins our ToSFiT algorithm. Empirically, we
validate our method on three diverse tasks: FAQ response refinement, thermally
stable protein search, and quantum circuit design. We demonstrate that online
fine-tuning significantly improves sample efficiency, with negligible impact on
computational efficiency.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为邻近核的新相似性度量方法，可直接在不完整数据的核特征空间中计算相似性，无需在原始空间进行显式插补。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法要么丢弃不完整数据，要么进行插补预处理，导致信息丢失和相似性估计偏差。在Web挖掘、推荐系统和用户行为分析中，测量不完整数据之间的相似性是一个基本挑战。

Method: 引入数据相关的分箱结合邻近分配，将数据投影到适应局部密度变化的高维稀疏表示中。对于缺失值处理，提出了级联回退策略来估计缺失特征分布。

Result: 在12个真实世界不完整数据集上进行聚类任务，相比现有方法表现出优越性能，同时保持线性时间复杂度。

Conclusion: 邻近核方法能够有效处理不完整数据的相似性计算问题，避免了传统插补方法的信息损失和偏差问题。

Abstract: Measuring similarity between incomplete data is a fundamental challenge in
web mining, recommendation systems, and user behavior analysis. Traditional
approaches either discard incomplete data or perform imputation as a
preprocessing step, leading to information loss and biased similarity
estimates. This paper presents the proximity kernel, a new similarity measure
that directly computes similarity between incomplete data in kernel feature
space without explicit imputation in the original space. The proposed method
introduces data-dependent binning combined with proximity assignment to project
data into a high-dimensional sparse representation that adapts to local density
variations. For missing value handling, we propose a cascading fallback
strategy to estimate missing feature distributions. We conduct clustering tasks
on the proposed kernel representation across 12 real world incomplete datasets,
demonstrating superior performance compared to existing methods while
maintaining linear time complexity. All the code are available at

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了Generalist框架，通过将整体泛化目标分解为多个子任务，每个子任务分配给专门的基学习器，然后插值参数形成全局学习器，缓解了对抗训练中自然精度下降和跨攻击鲁棒性差的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 对抗训练虽然是最有效的防御方法，但在实际应用中存在两个主要限制：自然精度相比标准训练显著下降，以及在不同范数约束下攻击间的鲁棒性迁移性差。

Method: 将泛化目标分解为多个子任务，每个基学习器专注于特定目标；在训练后期插值基学习器参数形成全局学习器；定期将全局参数重新分配给基学习器防止优化轨迹偏离共享目标。

Result: 理论分析和大量实验表明，Generalist实现了更低的泛化误差，显著缓解了权衡问题，相比基线方法表现更好。

Conclusion: Generalist为未来开发完全鲁棒的分类器提供了一个有前景的方向。

Abstract: Despite the rapid progress of neural networks, they remain highly vulnerable
to adversarial examples, for which adversarial training (AT) is currently the
most effective defense. While AT has been extensively studied, its practical
applications expose two major limitations: natural accuracy tends to degrade
significantly compared with standard training, and robustness does not transfer
well across attacks crafted under different norm constraints. Unlike prior
works that attempt to address only one issue within a single network, we
propose to partition the overall generalization goal into multiple sub-tasks,
each assigned to a dedicated base learner. By specializing in its designated
objective, each base learner quickly becomes an expert in its field. In the
later stages of training, we interpolate their parameters to form a
knowledgeable global learner, while periodically redistributing the global
parameters back to the base learners to prevent their optimization trajectories
from drifting too far from the shared target. We term this framework Generalist
and introduce three variants tailored to different application scenarios. Both
theoretical analysis and extensive experiments demonstrate that Generalist
achieves lower generalization error and significantly alleviates the trade-off
problems compared with baseline methods. Our results suggest that Generalist
provides a promising step toward developing fully robust classifiers in the
future.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管Transformer在离线或基于模型的强化学习中表现出色，但在在线无模型强化学习中仍未被充分探索，主要因为其对训练设置和模型设计决策的敏感性。

Method: 研究了关键设计问题：如何条件化输入、在actor和critic之间共享组件、以及如何切片序列数据进行训练，提出了稳定的架构和训练策略。

Result: 实验表明该策略在完全和部分可观测任务中都能实现有竞争力的性能，适用于向量和图像两种设置。

Conclusion: 这些发现为在在线强化学习中应用Transformer提供了实用指导。

Abstract: Despite their effectiveness and popularity in offline or model-based
reinforcement learning (RL), transformers remain underexplored in online
model-free RL due to their sensitivity to training setups and model design
decisions such as how to structure the policy and value networks, share
components, or handle temporal information. In this paper, we show that
transformers can be strong baselines for continuous control in online
model-free RL. We investigate key design questions: how to condition inputs,
share components between actor and critic, and slice sequential data for
training. Our experiments reveal stable architectural and training strategies
enabling competitive performance across fully and partially observable tasks,
and in both vector- and image-based settings. These findings offer practical
guidance for applying transformers in online RL.

Conclusion: 验证了依赖建模与对比学习结合的有效性，为云服务异常检测提供了完整技术方案，在复杂环境中表现出强大的适应性和稳定性。

Abstract: This paper addresses the challenges of complex dependencies and diverse
anomaly patterns in cloud service environments by proposing a dependency
modeling and anomaly detection method that integrates contrastive learning. The
method abstracts service interactions into a dependency graph, extracts
temporal and structural features through embedding functions, and employs a
graph convolution mechanism to aggregate neighborhood information for
context-aware service representations. A contrastive learning framework is then
introduced, constructing positive and negative sample pairs to enhance the
separability of normal and abnormal patterns in the representation space.
Furthermore, a temporal consistency constraint is designed to maintain
representation stability across time steps and reduce the impact of short-term
fluctuations and noise. The overall optimization combines contrastive loss and
temporal consistency loss to ensure stable and reliable detection across
multi-dimensional features. Experiments on public datasets systematically
evaluate the method from hyperparameter, environmental, and data sensitivity
perspectives. Results show that the proposed approach significantly outperforms
existing methods on key metrics such as Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and AUC,
while maintaining robustness under conditions of sparse labeling, monitoring
noise, and traffic fluctuations. This study verifies the effectiveness of
integrating dependency modeling with contrastive learning, provides a complete
technical solution for cloud service anomaly detection, and demonstrates strong
adaptability and stability in complex environments.

Conclusion: 该预测市场设计能够有效促进独立代理间的预测协作，同时适应动态变化的市场条件。

Abstract: Although both data availability and the demand for accurate forecasts are
increasing, collaboration between stakeholders is often constrained by data
ownership and competitive interests. In contrast to recent proposals within
cooperative game-theoretical frameworks, we place ourselves in a more general
framework, based on prediction markets. There, independent agents trade
forecasts of uncertain future events in exchange for rewards. We introduce and
analyse a prediction market that (i) accounts for the historical performance of
the agents, (ii) adapts to time-varying conditions, while (iii) permitting
agents to enter and exit the market at will. The proposed design employs robust
regression models to learn the optimal forecasts' combination whilst handling
missing submissions. Moreover, we introduce a pay-off allocation mechanism that
considers both in-sample and out-of-sample performance while satisfying several
desirable economic properties. Case-studies using simulated and real-world data
allow demonstrating the effectiveness and adaptability of the proposed market
design.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出基于图神经网络(GNN)的新方法，用于近似计算网络流博弈中的Banzhaf值，相比传统精确计算和蒙特卡洛采样方法，实现了数量级的速度提升和零样本泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 网络流博弈中的Banzhaf值计算对于量化多智能体系统中的影响力至关重要，但精确计算在超过约20个智能体时变得不可行，而蒙特卡洛方法样本复杂度高且无法跨网络配置迁移知识。

Method: 将问题构建为图级预测任务，使用图神经网络(GNN)直接从网络拓扑和控制结构中学习智能体影响力的通用模式，比较了GAT、GINE和EdgeConv三种GNN架构。

Result: 在包含200,000个图的大规模合成数据集上，训练后的GNN模型实现了高保真度的Banzhaf值近似，相比精确和基于采样的方法实现了数量级的速度提升，并展示了强大的零样本泛化能力。

Conclusion: 这项工作确立了GNN作为复杂网络系统可扩展合作博弈论分析的实用工具，能够准确预测具有不同结构特性的全新网络的Banzhaf值，无需重新训练。

Abstract: Computing the Banzhaf value in network flow games is fundamental for
quantifying agent influence in multi-agent systems, with applications ranging
from cybersecurity to infrastructure planning. However, exact computation is
intractable for systems with more than $\sim20$ agents due to exponential
complexity $\mathcal{O}(2^m)$. While Monte Carlo sampling methods provide
statistical estimates, they suffer from high sample complexity and cannot
transfer knowledge across different network configurations, making them
impractical for large-scale or dynamic systems. We present a novel
learning-based approach using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to approximate
Banzhaf values in cardinal network flow games. By framing the problem as a
graph-level prediction task, our method learns generalisable patterns of agent
influence directly from network topology and control structure. We conduct a
comprehensive empirical study comparing three state-of-the-art GNN
architectures-Graph Attention Networks (GAT), Graph Isomorphism Networks with
Edge features (GINE), and EdgeConv-on a large-scale synthetic dataset of
200,000 graphs per configuration, varying in size (20-100 nodes), agent count
(5-20), and edge probability (0.5-1.0). Our results demonstrate that trained
GNN models achieve high-fidelity Banzhaf value approximation with
order-of-magnitude speedups compared to exact and sampling-based methods. Most
significantly, we show strong zero-shot generalisation: models trained on
graphs of a specific size and topology accurately predict Banzhaf values for
entirely new networks with different structural properties, without requiring
retraining. This work establishes GNNs as a practical tool for scalable
cooperative game-theoretic analysis of complex networked systems.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一个假设宽松的框架来评估生存分析中条件平均处理效应（CATE）估计在存在删失偏倚时的稳健性，通过部分识别方法推导CATE的信息边界。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床试验中高达一半的患者因副作用等原因提前退出，当退出是信息性时（即依赖于生存时间），会引入删失偏倚，导致治疗效果估计也存在偏倚。

Method: 使用部分识别方法推导CATE的信息边界，开发了一种新的元学习器，可以利用任意机器学习模型估计边界，具有双重稳健性和准oracle效率的理论特性。

Result: 该框架有助于识别即使在信息性删失情况下治疗仍然有效的患者亚组，在数值实验和癌症药物试验应用中展示了实用价值。

Conclusion: 该框架为评估存在删失时估计治疗效果的稳健性提供了实用工具，促进了生存数据在医学和流行病学中证据生成的可靠使用。

Abstract: Dropout is common in clinical studies, with up to half of patients leaving
early due to side effects or other reasons. When dropout is informative (i.e.,
dependent on survival time), it introduces censoring bias, because of which
treatment effect estimates are also biased. In this paper, we propose an
assumption-lean framework to assess the robustness of conditional average
treatment effect (CATE) estimates in survival analysis when facing censoring
bias. Unlike existing works that rely on strong assumptions, such as
non-informative censoring, to obtain point estimation, we use partial
identification to derive informative bounds on the CATE. Thereby, our framework
helps to identify patient subgroups where treatment is effective despite
informative censoring. We further develop a novel meta-learner that estimates
the bounds using arbitrary machine learning models and with favorable
theoretical properties, including double robustness and quasi-oracle
efficiency. We demonstrate the practical value of our meta-learner through
numerical experiments and in an application to a cancer drug trial. Together,
our framework offers a practical tool for assessing the robustness of estimated
treatment effects in the presence of censoring and thus promotes the reliable
use of survival data for evidence generation in medicine and epidemiology.

Abstract: Enhancing scene understanding in adverse visibility conditions remains a
critical challenge for surveillance and autonomous navigation systems.
Conventional imaging modalities, such as RGB and thermal infrared (MWIR /
LWIR), when fused, often struggle to deliver comprehensive scene information,
particularly under conditions of atmospheric interference or inadequate
illumination. To address these limitations, Short-Wave Infrared (SWIR) imaging
has emerged as a promising modality due to its ability to penetrate atmospheric
disturbances and differentiate materials with improved clarity. However, the
advancement and widespread implementation of SWIR-based systems face
significant hurdles, primarily due to the scarcity of publicly accessible SWIR
datasets. In response to this challenge, our research introduces an approach to
synthetically generate SWIR-like structural/contrast cues (without claiming
spectral reproduction) images from existing LWIR data using advanced contrast
enhancement techniques. We then propose a multimodal fusion framework
integrating synthetic SWIR, LWIR, and RGB modalities, employing an optimized

TL;DR: AdaLog是一个轻量级自适应系统，通过消除特征级冗余数据和优化异构行为存储，显著减少移动应用中用户行为日志的存储空间，同时保持模型推理精度和延迟。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着机器学习模型在移动应用中的普及，记录用户行为数据带来了巨大的存储成本，导致系统响应性降低和应用卸载率上升。现有工业实践存在特征冗余和存储稀疏的问题。

Method: 1) 将特征级冗余数据消除建模为超图中的最大权重匹配问题，提出分层算法；2) 使用虚拟哈希属性设计将异构行为分布到少量日志文件中；3) 设计增量更新机制以适应动态用户行为模式。

Result: 在真实用户数据上的评估显示，AdaLog将行为日志大小减少了19%到44%，系统开销极小（仅2秒延迟和15MB内存使用）。

Conclusion: AdaLog为更广泛采用设备端机器学习提供了更高效的数据基础，解决了移动应用中用户行为日志存储的瓶颈问题。

Abstract: Machine learning (ML) models are increasingly integrated into modern mobile
apps to enable personalized and intelligent services. These models typically
rely on rich input features derived from historical user behaviors to capture
user intents. However, as ML-driven services become more prevalent, recording
necessary user behavior data imposes substantial storage cost on mobile apps,
leading to lower system responsiveness and more app uninstalls. To address this
storage bottleneck, we present AdaLog, a lightweight and adaptive system
designed to improve the storage efficiency of user behavior log in ML-embedded
mobile apps, without compromising model inference accuracy or latency. We
identify two key inefficiencies in current industrial practices of user
behavior log: (i) redundant logging of overlapping behavior data across
different features and models, and (ii) sparse storage caused by storing
behaviors with heterogeneous attribute descriptions in a single log file. To
solve these issues, AdaLog first formulates the elimination of feature-level
redundant data as a maximum weighted matching problem in hypergraphs, and
proposes a hierarchical algorithm for efficient on-device deployment. Then,
AdaLog employs a virtually hashed attribute design to distribute heterogeneous
behaviors into a few log files with physically dense storage. Finally, to
ensure scalability to dynamic user behavior patterns, AdaLog designs an
incremental update mechanism to minimize the I/O operations needed for adapting
outdated behavior log. We implement a prototype of AdaLog and deploy it into
popular mobile apps in collaboration with our industry partner. Evaluations on
real-world user data show that AdaLog reduces behavior log size by 19% to 44%
with minimal system overhead (only 2 seconds latency and 15 MB memory usage),
providing a more efficient data foundation for broader adoption of on-device
ML.

TL;DR: 本文研究如何通过正交变换对齐不同嵌入模型，提出基于Procrustes后处理的方法，使两个嵌入模型在保持各自几何结构的同时实现互操作性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决相似数据上分别训练的嵌入模型缺乏互操作性的问题，这在模型重训练、部分模型升级和多模态搜索等应用中带来挑战。

Method: 使用Procrustes后处理方法，通过正交变换对齐两个嵌入集合，前提是它们的成对点积近似保持。

Result: 实验证明该方法在三个应用中有效：跨重训练的兼容性维护、不同模型组合用于文本检索、改进混合模态搜索（达到最先进性能）。

Conclusion: 通过正交变换可以有效地对齐嵌入模型，实现互操作性同时保持各自嵌入空间的几何结构。

Abstract: Embedding models trained separately on similar data often produce
representations that encode stable information but are not directly
interchangeable. This lack of interoperability raises challenges in several
practical applications, such as model retraining, partial model upgrades, and
multimodal search. Driven by these challenges, we study when two sets of
embeddings can be aligned by an orthogonal transformation. We show that if
pairwise dot products are approximately preserved, then there exists an
isometry that closely aligns the two sets, and we provide a tight bound on the
alignment error. This insight yields a simple alignment recipe, Procrustes
post-processing, that makes two embedding models interoperable while preserving
the geometry of each embedding space. Empirically, we demonstrate its
effectiveness in three applications: maintaining compatibility across
retrainings, combining different models for text retrieval, and improving
mixed-modality search, where it achieves state-of-the-art performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 肿瘤学实验数据通常稀疏且只有少量时间点的肿瘤体积数据，需要利用先验知识来改进模型性能。

Method: 扩展物理信息神经网络框架，将观测到的生物约束作为正则化项，嵌入到损失函数中。

Result: 该方法能够在少量训练样本下获得合理解，成功学习间歇性治疗动态，并得到ODE解和时变参数形式，在MSE、MAE和MAPE指标上表现出强收敛性。

Conclusion: 改进的PINN算法能够有效处理肿瘤学中的稀疏数据问题，通过嵌入生物约束实现良好泛化性能。

Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) are neural networks that embed the
laws of dynamical systems modeled by differential equations into their loss
function as constraints. In this work, we present a PINN framework applied to
oncology. Here, we seek to learn time-varying interactions due to a combination
therapy in a tumor microenvironment. In oncology, experimental data are often
sparse and composed of a few time points of tumor volume. By embedding
inductive biases derived from prior information about a dynamical system, we
extend the physics-informed neural networks (PINN) and incorporate observed
biological constraints as regularization agents. The modified PINN algorithm is
able to steer itself to a reasonable solution and can generalize well with only
a few training examples. We demonstrate the merit of our approach by learning
the dynamics of treatment applied intermittently in an ordinary differential
equation (ODE) model of a combination therapy. The algorithm yields a solution
to the ODE and time-varying forms of some of the ODE model parameters. We
demonstrate a strong convergence using metrics such as the mean squared error
(MSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE).

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合Mamdani系统可解释性和TSK模型精度的新型模糊回归方法，通过混合规则结构和双支配类型，在保持可解释性的同时提高了预测精度。


<details>

Motivation: 传统回归方法难以处理现实数据中的不确定性和模糊性，深度学习虽然能捕捉复杂非线性关系但缺乏可解释性且在小数据集上容易过拟合。模糊系统能处理不确定性，但Mamdani和TSK系统在可解释性和精度之间存在权衡。

Method: 提出混合模糊回归方法，结合Mamdani系统的可解释性和TSK模型的精度，采用包含模糊和清晰组件的混合规则结构以及双支配类型。

Result: 在6个基准数据集上的评估显示，该方法在4个数据集中获得最佳模糊方法得分，在2个数据集中优于不透明模型，在1个数据集中获得总体最佳得分，RMSE改进范围从0.4%到19%。

Conclusion: 这种混合方法为预测建模提供了一个平衡且多功能的工具，解决了模糊系统中可解释性与精度之间的权衡问题。

Abstract: Regression analysis is employed to examine and quantify the relationships
between input variables and a dependent and continuous output variable. It is
widely used for predictive modelling in fields such as finance, healthcare, and
engineering. However, traditional methods often struggle with real-world data
complexities, including uncertainty and ambiguity. While deep learning
approaches excel at capturing complex non-linear relationships, they lack
interpretability and risk over-fitting on small datasets. Fuzzy systems provide
an alternative framework for handling uncertainty and imprecision, with Mamdani
and Takagi-Sugeno-Kang (TSK) systems offering complementary strengths:
interpretability versus accuracy. This paper presents a novel fuzzy regression
method that combines the interpretability of Mamdani systems with the precision
of TSK models. The proposed approach introduces a hybrid rule structure with
fuzzy and crisp components and dual dominance types, enhancing both accuracy
and explainability. Evaluations on benchmark datasets demonstrate
state-of-the-art performance in several cases, with rules maintaining a
component similar to traditional Mamdani systems while improving precision
through improved rule outputs. This hybrid methodology offers a balanced and
versatile tool for predictive modelling, addressing the trade-off between
interpretability and accuracy inherent in fuzzy systems. In the 6 datasets
tested, the proposed approach gave the best fuzzy methodology score in 4
datasets, out-performed the opaque models in 2 datasets and produced the best
overall score in 1 dataset with the improvements in RMSE ranging from 0.4% to
19%.

TL;DR: 提出了一种无监督的低秩方法来校正停车位GPS点的误差，并基于停车位与道路平行的物理约束将其对齐到实际位置。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高层建筑会导致GPS点漂移，且低成本GPS设备本身存在定位误差，需要从大量停车位中无监督地校正少量错误的GPS点。

Method: 利用停车位与道路平行的物理约束，提出无监督低秩方法，在一个统一框架中同时进行GPS点误差校正和对齐。

Result: 大量实验证明该方法能有效解决实际问题，对任何类型的GPS点误差都简单有效。

Conclusion: 该方法为停车管理、停车政策和城市发展等应用提供了准确的停车位GPS数据。

Abstract: Parking spots are essential components, providing vital mobile resources for
residents in a city. Accurate Global Positioning System (GPS) points of parking
spots are the core data for subsequent applications,e.g., parking management,
parking policy, and urban development. However, high-rise buildings tend to
cause GPS points to drift from the actual locations of parking spots; besides,
the standard lower-cost GPS equipment itself has a certain location error.
Therefore, it is a non-trivial task to correct a few wrong GPS points from a
large number of parking spots in an unsupervised approach. In this paper,
motivated by the physical constraints of parking spots (i.e., parking spots are
parallel to the sides of roads), we propose an unsupervised low-rank method to
effectively rectify errors in GPS points and further align them to the parking
spots in a unified framework. The proposed unconventional rectification and
alignment method is simple and yet effective for any type of GPS point errors.
Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method to
solve a practical problem. The data set and the code are publicly accessible

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 证明多项式非负性是一个NP难问题，传统SOS方法需要求解维度随单项式基大小二次增长的SDP，计算代价高昂

Method: 训练Transformer模型预测几乎最小的单项式基，包含三个关键组件：生成超过1亿个SOS多项式的训练数据集、设计和训练Transformer架构、系统性的回退机制保证正确终止

Result: 在200多个基准数据集上验证，相比最先进求解器实现100倍以上加速，能够解决竞争方法失败的实例

Conclusion: 该方法为提升SOS编程的实际可扩展性提供了新的见解

Abstract: Certifying nonnegativity of polynomials is a well-known NP-hard problem with
direct applications spanning non-convex optimization, control, robotics, and
beyond. A sufficient condition for nonnegativity is the Sum of Squares (SOS)
property, i.e., it can be written as a sum of squares of other polynomials. In
practice, however, certifying the SOS criterion remains computationally
expensive and often involves solving a Semidefinite Program (SDP), whose
dimensionality grows quadratically in the size of the monomial basis of the SOS
expression; hence, various methods to reduce the size of the monomial basis
have been proposed. In this work, we introduce the first learning-augmented
algorithm to certify the SOS criterion. To this end, we train a Transformer
model that predicts an almost-minimal monomial basis for a given polynomial,
thereby drastically reducing the size of the corresponding SDP. Our overall
methodology comprises three key components: efficient training dataset
generation of over 100 million SOS polynomials, design and training of the
corresponding Transformer architecture, and a systematic fallback mechanism to
ensure correct termination, which we analyze theoretically. We validate our
approach on over 200 benchmark datasets, achieving speedups of over $100\times$
compared to state-of-the-art solvers and enabling the solution of instances
where competing approaches fail. Our findings provide novel insights towards
transforming the practical scalability of SOS programming.

Motivation: 预测概率的校准对于可靠的机器学习至关重要，但标准训练程序如何产生良好校准模型的理解尚不充分。

Method: 建立了基于优化误差、正则化强度和Rademacher复杂度的平滑校准误差有限样本泛化界，并在再生核希尔伯特空间中实例化该理论，为核岭回归和逻辑回归提供具体保证。

Result: 实验证实了这些具体保证，表明L2正则化ERM可以提供良好校准的模型，无需提升或后处理重新校准。

Conclusion: 标准L2正则化经验风险最小化本身就具有控制模型校准误差的理论保证，无需额外的校准技术。

Abstract: Calibration of predicted probabilities is critical for reliable machine
learning, yet it is poorly understood how standard training procedures yield
well-calibrated models. This work provides the first theoretical proof that
canonical $L_{2}$-regularized empirical risk minimization directly controls the
smooth calibration error (smCE) without post-hoc correction or specialized
calibration-promoting regularizer. We establish finite-sample generalization
bounds for smCE based on optimization error, regularization strength, and the
Rademacher complexity. We then instantiate this theory for models in
reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces, deriving concrete guarantees for kernel
ridge and logistic regression. Our experiments confirm these specific
guarantees, demonstrating that $L_{2}$-regularized ERM can provide a
well-calibrated model without boosting or post-hoc recalibration. The source
code to reproduce all experiments is available at

Method: 为每个最优性阶次构建学习算法，并开发可触发有限时间停止的停止规则。

Result: 识别出具有唯一Bellman最优策略的MDP类别，该类别与最优性阶次无关，且算法在该类MDP中能有限时间停止。

Conclusion: 提出了在可能情况下有限时间停止的偏差最优策略识别方法，扩展了MDP中策略最优性的理论框架。

Abstract: Although average gain optimality is a commonly adopted performance measure in
Markov Decision Processes (MDPs), it is often too asymptotic. Further
incorporating measures of immediate losses leads to the hierarchy of bias
optimalities, all the way up to Blackwell optimality. In this paper, we
investigate the problem of identifying policies of such optimality orders. To
that end, for each order, we construct a learning algorithm with vanishing
probability of error. Furthermore, we characterize the class of MDPs for which
identification algorithms can stop in finite time. That class corresponds to
the MDPs with a unique Bellman optimal policy, and does not depend on the
optimality order considered. Lastly, we provide a tractable stopping rule that
when coupled to our learning algorithm triggers in finite time whenever it is
possible to do so.

Abstract: Epilepsy is a prevalent neurological disorder marked by sudden, brief
episodes of excessive neuronal activity caused by abnormal electrical
discharges, which may lead to some mental disorders. Most existing deep
learning methods for epilepsy detection rely solely on unimodal EEG signals,
neglecting the potential benefits of multimodal information. To address this,
we propose a novel multimodal model, DistilCLIP-EEG, based on the CLIP
framework, which integrates both EEG signals and text descriptions to capture
comprehensive features of epileptic seizures. The model involves an EEG encoder
based on the Conformer architecture as a text encoder, the proposed Learnable
BERT (BERT-LP) as prompt learning within the encoders. Both operate in a shared
latent space for effective cross-modal representation learning. To enhance
efficiency and adaptability, we introduce a knowledge distillation method where
the trained DistilCLIP-EEG serves as a teacher to guide a more compact student
model to reduce training complexity and time. On the TUSZ, AUBMC, and CHB-MIT
datasets, both the teacher and student models achieved accuracy rates exceeding
97%. Across all datasets, the F1-scores were consistently above 0.94,
demonstrating the robustness and reliability of the proposed framework.
Moreover, the student model's parameter count and model size are approximately
58.1% of those of the teacher model, significantly reducing model complexity
and storage requirements while maintaining high performance. These results
highlight the potential of our proposed model for EEG-based epilepsy detection
and establish a solid foundation for deploying lightweight models in
resource-constrained settings.

Abstract: In this paper, we study the offline and online settings of reinforcement
learning from human feedback (RLHF) with KL-regularization -- a widely used
objective function in large language model alignment -- under the $\epsilon$
local differential privacy ($\epsilon$-LDP) model on the label of the human
preference. In the offline setting, we design an algorithm based on the
principle of pessimism and derive a new suboptimality gap of
$\tilde{O}(1/[(e^\epsilon-1)^2 n])$ on the KL-regularized objective under
single-policy concentrability. We also prove its optimality by providing a
matching lower bound where $n$ is the sample size.
  In the online setting, we are the first one to theoretically investigate the
problem of KL-regularized RLHF with LDP. We design an optimism-based algorithm
and derive a logarithmic regret bound of $O(d_{\mathcal{F}}\log
(N_{\mathcal{F}}\cdot T) /(e^\epsilon-1)^2 )$, where $T$ is the total time
step, $N_{\mathcal{F}}$ is cardinality of the reward function space
$\mathcal{F}$ and $d_{\mathcal{F}}$ is a variant of eluder dimension for RLHF.
As a by-product of our analysis, our results also imply the first analysis for
online KL-regularized RLHF without privacy. We implement our algorithm in the
offline setting to verify our theoretical results and release our open source
code at: https://github.com/rushil-thareja/PPKL-RLHF-Official.

Abstract: On-device deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) frequently leverages
Low-Rank Adapters (LoRAs) to support diverse downstream tasks under tight
resource constraints. To address the limited storage capacity of mobile
devices, recent works have explored model merging techniques to fuse multiple
LoRAs into a single one. In practice, however, LoRAs are often delivered
incrementally, as users request support for new tasks (e.g., novel problem
types or languages). This scenario introduces a new challenge: on-device online
continual merging, where the objective is to incorporate new LoRAs while
preserving the performance on previously supported tasks. In this paper, we
propose a data-free and computationally efficient strategy for selecting and
merging LoRAs when a new one becomes available, assuming the device can store
only a limited number of adapters. Extensive experiments across real-world
tasks demonstrate the superiority of our approach compared to alternative
strategies while adhering to the storage budget and compute limitations of
on-device settings.

Abstract: Topic modeling is a useful tool for analyzing large corpora of written
documents, particularly academic papers. Despite a wide variety of proposed
topic modeling techniques, these techniques do not perform well when applied to
medical texts. This can be due to the low number of documents available for
some topics in the healthcare domain. In this paper, we propose ProtoTopic, a
prototypical network-based topic model used for topic generation for a set of
medical paper abstracts. Prototypical networks are efficient, explainable
models that make predictions by computing distances between input datapoints
and a set of prototype representations, making them particularly effective in
low-data or few-shot learning scenarios. With ProtoTopic, we demonstrate
improved topic coherence and diversity compared to two topic modeling baselines
used in the literature, demonstrating the ability of our model to generate
medically relevant topics even with limited data.

Conclusion: 该工作成功扩展了在线凸优化到多目标场景，并提供了一个简单有效的算法来解决最小最大遗憾问题，具有理论保证。

Abstract: In online convex optimization (OCO), a single loss function sequence is
revealed over a time horizon of $T$, and an online algorithm has to choose its
action at time $t$, before the loss function at time $t$ is revealed. The goal
of the online algorithm is to incur minimal penalty (called $\textit{regret}$
compared to a static optimal action made by an optimal offline algorithm
knowing all functions of the sequence in advance.
  In this paper, we broaden the horizon of OCO, and consider multi-objective
OCO, where there are $K$ distinct loss function sequences, and an algorithm has
to choose its action at time $t$, before the $K$ loss functions at time $t$ are
revealed. To capture the tradeoff between tracking the $K$ different sequences,
we consider the $\textit{min-max}$ regret, where the benchmark (optimal offline
algorithm) takes a static action across all time slots that minimizes the
maximum of the total loss (summed across time slots) incurred by each of the
$K$ sequences. An online algorithm is allowed to change its action across time
slots, and its {\it min-max} regret is defined as the difference between its
$\textit{min-max}$ cost and that of the benchmark. The $\textit{min-max}$
regret is a stringent performance measure and an algorithm with small regret
needs to `track' all loss function sequences closely at all times.
  We consider this $\textit{min-max}$ regret in the i.i.d. input setting where
all loss functions are i.i.d. generated from an unknown distribution. For the
i.i.d. model we propose a simple algorithm that combines the well-known
$\textit{Hedge}$ and online gradient descent (OGD) and show via a remarkably
simple proof that its expected $\textit{min-max}$ regret is $O(\sqrt{T \log
K})$.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦持续学习需要在保护隐私和通信效率的同时平衡性能，现有方法面临挑战。

Method: 使用低秩适配器(LoRA)减少通信开销，结合DualGradient Projection Memory防止遗忘，在联邦环境中学习新任务。

Result: 在CIFAR-100、ImageNet-R、ImageNet-A和CUB-200数据集上，DOLFIN在最终平均准确率上持续超越六个强基线，同时保持相同内存占用。

Conclusion: 正交低秩适配器为联邦环境中的隐私保护持续学习提供了有效且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Federated continual learning (FCL) enables models to learn new tasks across
multiple distributed clients, protecting privacy and without forgetting
previously acquired knowledge. However, current methods face challenges
balancing performance, privacy preservation, and communication efficiency. We
introduce a Distributed Online LoRA for Federated INcremental learning method
DOLFIN, a novel approach combining Vision Transformers with low-rank adapters
designed to efficiently and stably learn new tasks in federated environments.
Our method leverages LoRA for minimal communication overhead and incorporates
DualGradient Projection Memory (DualGPM) to prevent forgetting. Evaluated on
CIFAR-100, ImageNet-R, ImageNet-A, and CUB-200 under two Dirichlet
heterogeneity settings, DOLFIN consistently surpasses six strong baselines in
final average accuracy while matching their memory footprint. Orthogonal
low-rank adapters offer an effective and scalable solution for
privacy-preserving continual learning in federated settings.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文研究了针对MMLU基准测试的选择性对抗攻击，发现这些攻击能够显著改变语言模型的相对排名，挑战了排行榜驱动评估的公平性和可重复性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基准测试结果对LLM的信任、选择和部署越来越重要，但这些评估容易受到语义等效对抗扰动的影响。现有研究关注影响所有模型的攻击，而本文研究能否选择性地降低或提升特定模型性能，同时最小化对其他模型的影响。

Method: 使用TextAttack框架中的经典攻击方法，开发了选择性评估协议，设计了定制约束来提高攻击选择性，并提出了基于代理LLM的管道来生成选择性扰动。

Result: 实证研究发现选择性对抗攻击确实存在，并且能够实质性改变模型的相对排名，表明即使细微的编辑也能改变比较判断。

Conclusion: 研究结果强调了在LLM评估中需要扰动感知报告和鲁棒性诊断，证明当前排行榜驱动评估在公平性、可重复性和透明度方面存在挑战。

Abstract: Benchmarking outcomes increasingly govern trust, selection, and deployment of
LLMs, yet these evaluations remain vulnerable to semantically equivalent
adversarial perturbations. Prior work on adversarial robustness in NLP has
emphasized text attacks that affect many models equally, leaving open the
question of whether it is possible to selectively degrade or enhance
performance while minimally affecting other models. We formalize this problem
and study selective adversarial attacks on MMLU - a widely used benchmark
designed to measure a language model's broad general knowledge and reasoning
ability across different subjects. Using canonical attacks integrated into
TextAttack framework, we introduce a protocol for selectivity assessment,
develop a custom constraint to increase selectivity of attacks and propose a
surrogate-LLM pipeline that generates selective perturbations. Empirically, we
find that selective adversarial attacks exist and can materially alter relative
rankings, challenging the fairness, reproducibility, and transparency of
leaderboard-driven evaluation. Our results motivate perturbation-aware
reporting and robustness diagnostics for LLM evaluation and demonstrate that
even subtle edits can shift comparative judgments.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出EEGChaT，一种基于Transformer的通道选择模块，用于自动识别SEEG记录中最具任务相关性的通道，通过通道聚合令牌和改进的注意力展开技术计算可解释的通道重要性分数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SEEG信号分析对脑机接口和神经科学研究至关重要，但由于输入通道数量大且相关性异构，传统通道选择方法难以扩展或提供有意义的可解释性。

Method: EEGChaT引入通道聚合令牌来聚合跨通道信息，利用改进的注意力展开技术计算可解释的定量通道重要性分数。

Result: 在DuIN数据集上的评估显示，将EEGChaT与现有分类模型集成可一致提高解码准确率，实现高达17%的绝对增益，且产生的通道权重与手动选择的通道有显著重叠。

Conclusion: EEGChaT是高维SEEG分析中有效且可泛化的通道选择解决方案，既提供增强性能又提供对神经信号相关性的洞察。

Abstract: Analyzing stereoelectroencephalography (SEEG) signals is critical for
brain-computer interface (BCI) applications and neuroscience research, yet
poses significant challenges due to the large number of input channels and
their heterogeneous relevance. Traditional channel selection methods struggle
to scale or provide meaningful interpretability for SEEG data. In this work, we
propose EEGChaT, a novel Transformer-based channel selection module designed to
automatically identify the most task-relevant channels in SEEG recordings.
EEGChaT introduces Channel Aggregation Tokens (CATs) to aggregate information
across channels, and leverages an improved Attention Rollout technique to
compute interpretable, quantitative channel importance scores. We evaluate
EEGChaT on the DuIN dataset, demonstrating that integrating EEGChaT with
existing classification models consistently improves decoding accuracy,
achieving up to 17\% absolute gains. Furthermore, the channel weights produced
by EEGChaT show substantial overlap with manually selected channels, supporting
the interpretability of the approach. Our results suggest that EEGChaT is an
effective and generalizable solution for channel selection in high-dimensional
SEEG analysis, offering both enhanced performance and insights into neural
signal relevance.

Result: 在3D心脏电动力学建模任务中，相比现有方法显著提高了预测精度

Conclusion: P-M-GP框架通过有效整合领域特定物理约束和几何先验，显著提升了时空动态系统建模的性能

Abstract: Recent advances in sensing and imaging technologies have enabled the
collection of high-dimensional spatiotemporal data across complex geometric
domains. However, effective modeling of such data remains challenging due to
irregular spatial structures, rapid temporal dynamics, and the need to jointly
predict multiple interrelated physical variables. This paper presents a
physics-augmented multi-task Gaussian Process (P-M-GP) framework tailored for
spatiotemporal dynamic systems. Specifically, we develop a geometry-aware,
multi-task Gaussian Process (M-GP) model to effectively capture intrinsic
spatiotemporal structure and inter-task dependencies. To further enhance the
model fidelity and robustness, we incorporate governing physical laws through a
physics-based regularization scheme, thereby constraining predictions to be
consistent with governing dynamical principles. We validate the proposed P-M-GP
framework on a 3D cardiac electrodynamics modeling task. Numerical experiments
demonstrate that our method significantly improves prediction accuracy over
existing methods by effectively incorporating domain-specific physical
constraints and geometric prior.

Motivation: 由于隐私法规和安全要求，需要从联邦学习模型中有效移除特定客户端的贡献。现有方法需要多轮通信，导致模型在移除过程中不可用，影响系统服务。

Method: 基于任务算术和神经正切核的创新解决方案，能够快速移除客户端对模型的影响。

Result: 该方法能够满足特定的效能和时间要求，避免模型在移除过程中的不可用性。

Conclusion: 提出的方法为解决联邦学习中客户端贡献移除问题提供了有效的解决方案，确保了模型的持续可用性。

Abstract: Nowdays, there are an abundance of portable devices capable of collecting
large amounts of data and with decent computational power. This opened the
possibility to train AI models in a distributed manner, preserving the
participating clients' privacy. However, because of privacy regulations and
safety requirements, elimination upon necessity of a client contribution to the
model has become mandatory. The cleansing process must satisfy specific
efficacy and time requirements. In recent years, research efforts have produced
several knowledge removal methods, but these require multiple communication
rounds between the data holders and the process coordinator. This can cause the
unavailability of an effective model up to the end of the removal process,
which can result in a disservice to the system users. In this paper, we
introduce an innovative solution based on Task Arithmetic and the Neural
Tangent Kernel, to rapidly remove a client's influence from a model.

Motivation: 现有GNN架构在表达力与计算效率之间存在权衡，需要一种既能提高表达力又保持高效计算的图神经网络架构。

Method: 基于Chiba和Nishizeki的经典三角形计数算法，提出EB-GNN架构，在消息传递过程中显式利用三角形结构信息。

Result: EB-1WL比1-WL表达力显著更强，EB-GNN在保持高效计算的同时，性能优于简单MPNN，与任务专用GNN竞争力相当。

Conclusion: EB-GNN是一种高效通用的图神经网络架构，在表达力和计算效率之间取得了良好平衡，为实际图学习任务提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: We propose EB-1WL, an edge-based color-refinement test, and a corresponding
GNN architecture, EB-GNN. Our architecture is inspired by a classic triangle
counting algorithm by Chiba and Nishizeki, and explicitly uses triangles during
message passing. We achieve the following results: (1)~EB-1WL is significantly
more expressive than 1-WL. Further, we provide a complete logical
characterization of EB-1WL based on first-order logic, and matching
distinguishability results based on homomorphism counting. (2)~In an important
distinction from previous proposals for more expressive GNN architectures,
EB-1WL and EB-GNN require near-linear time and memory on practical graph
learning tasks. (3)~Empirically, we show that EB-GNN is a highly-efficient
general-purpose architecture: It substantially outperforms simple MPNNs, and
remains competitive with task-specialized GNNs while being significantly more
computationally efficient.

*Riddhish Thakare,Kingdom Mutala Akugri*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文为经典非线性降维方法（如t-SNE、Isomap、LLE）引入了双向映射框架，通过神经解码器和扩散生成过程实现从低维嵌入到原始高维空间的映射，但在CelebA数据集上的实验显示其重建和生成质量不如端到端优化的自编码器。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 经典非线性降维技术虽然擅长创建低维嵌入用于可视化，但缺乏将这些嵌入映射回原始高维空间的能力，这种单向转换限制了它们在生成应用中的使用。

Method: 提出了一个系统框架，为主要的NLDR方法构建神经解码器架构，实现双向映射，并扩展该框架实现基于扩散的生成过程，直接在学习的流形空间中进行。

Result: 实验表明解码器能成功重建数据，但质量被端到端优化的自编码器超越；流形约束扩散产生低质量样本，表明经典NLDR嵌入的离散稀疏特性不适合生成模型所需的连续插值。

Conclusion: 这项工作突显了为主要用于可视化和分析而设计的NLDR方法添加生成能力所面临的固有挑战。

Abstract: Classical nonlinear dimensionality reduction (NLDR) techniques like t-SNE,
Isomap, and LLE excel at creating low-dimensional embeddings for data
visualization but fundamentally lack the ability to map these embeddings back
to the original high-dimensional space. This one-way transformation limits
their use in generative applications. This paper addresses this critical gap by
introducing a system- atic framework for constructing neural decoder
architectures for prominent NLDR methods, enabling bidirectional mapping for
the first time. We extend this framework by implementing a diffusion-based
generative process that operates directly within these learned manifold spaces.
Through experiments on the CelebA dataset, we evaluate the reconstruction and
generative performance of our approach against autoencoder and standard
diffusion model baselines. Our findings reveal a fundamental trade- off: while
the decoders successfully reconstruct data, their quality is surpassed by
end-to-end optimized autoencoders. Moreover, manifold-constrained diffusion
yields poor-quality samples, suggesting that the discrete and sparse nature of
classical NLDR embeddings is ill-suited for the continuous inter- polation
required by generative models. This work highlights the inherent challenges in
retrofitting generative capabilities onto NLDR methods designed primarily for
visualization and analysis.

Motivation: 随着时间序列基础模型的发展，其零样本预测能力需要可靠评估，但现有评估方法存在数据完整性、信息泄露和基准混淆等问题，可能导致性能估计失真。

Method: 通过调查现有TSFM评估方法，识别出基准数据集代表性、时空评估缺失、信息泄露风险和外部冲击影响等关键问题。

Result: 研究发现现有评估存在广泛的数据划分混淆，可能导致性能估计膨胀和全局知识错误传递到局部时间序列。

Conclusion: 需要开发稳健的评估方法，如基于真正样本外未来数据的评估，以保护TSFM评估的完整性，避免重蹈LLM和传统时间序列基准测试的覆辙。

Abstract: Time Series Foundation Models (TSFMs) represent a new paradigm for time
series forecasting, offering zero-shot forecasting capabilities without the
need for domain-specific pre-training or fine-tuning. However, as with Large
Language Models (LLMs), evaluating TSFMs is tricky, as with ever more extensive
training sets, it becomes more and more challenging to ensure the integrity of
benchmarking data. Our investigation of existing TSFM evaluation highlights
multiple challenges, ranging from the representativeness of the benchmark
datasets, over the lack of spatiotemporal evaluation, to risks of information
leakage due to overlapping and obscure datasets, and the memorization of global
patterns caused by external shocks like economic crises or pandemics. Our
findings reveal widespread confusion regarding data partitions, risking
inflated performance estimates and incorrect transfer of global knowledge to
local time series. We argue for the development of robust evaluation
methodologies to prevent pitfalls already observed in LLM and classical time
series benchmarking, and call upon the research community to design new,
principled approaches, such as evaluations on truly out-of-sample future data,
to safeguard the integrity of TSFM assessment.

Result: 在多种图像、文本和表格数据集上的实验表明，该方法相比基线方法和最先进技术获得了更优越的分类性能。

Conclusion: RCS方法通过分布校准策略有效解决了类别不平衡问题，在多个领域数据集上都表现出色。

Abstract: The class imbalance problem refers to the insufficiency of data in certain
classes, which causes a classifier to be biased toward the majority class.
Distribution calibration is a technique that seeks to estimate a more accurate
class distribution based on an observed or estimated one. To address this
issue, we propose a distribution calibration-based method-Rebalancing with
Calibrated Sub-classes (RCS): An Enhanced Approach for Robust Imbalanced
Classification, which estimates the distribution parameters of the minority
classes using weighted parameters derived from a mixture of Gaussian components
from both the majority and intermediate classes. An encoder-decoder network is
trained to preserve the structure of the imbalanced data and prevent
disentanglement. After training, feature vectors extracted from the encoder are
used to generate synthetic samples through our distribution calibration
strategy. This approach effectively mitigates the overgeneralization problem
that arises when only the distribution of the majority class is used to
approximate the minority class statistics. Instead, our method calibrates the
parameters by leveraging the distribution of data points in neighboring
regions. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves
superior classification performance compared to several baseline and
state-of-the-art techniques across a diverse range of image, text, and tabular
datasets.

Conclusion: XNN架构能有效处理不同维度的物理数据，为PDE基础模型提供了维度无关的解决方案，展现了跨维度泛化的优势。

Abstract: The advent of foundation models in AI has significantly advanced
general-purpose learning, enabling remarkable capabilities in zero-shot
inference and in-context learning. However, training such models on physics
data, including solutions to partial differential equations (PDEs), poses a
unique challenge due to varying dimensionalities across different systems.
Traditional approaches either fix a maximum dimension or employ separate
encoders for different dimensionalities, resulting in inefficiencies. To
address this, we propose a dimension-agnostic neural network architecture, the
Axial Neural Network (XNN), inspired by parameter-sharing structures such as
Deep Sets and Graph Neural Networks. XNN generalizes across varying tensor
dimensions while maintaining computational efficiency. We convert existing PDE
foundation models into axial neural networks and evaluate their performance
across three training scenarios: training from scratch, pretraining on multiple
PDEs, and fine-tuning on a single PDE. Our experiments show that XNNs perform
competitively with original models and exhibit superior generalization to
unseen dimensions, highlighting the importance of multidimensional pretraining
for foundation models.

Abstract: Diagonal preconditioners are computationally feasible approximate to
second-order optimizers, which have shown significant promise in accelerating
training of deep learning models. Two predominant approaches are based on Adam
and Gauss-Newton (GN) methods: the former leverages statistics of current
gradients and is the de-factor optimizers for neural networks, and the latter
uses the diagonal elements of the Gauss-Newton matrix and underpins some of the
recent diagonal optimizers such as Sophia.
  In this work, we compare these two diagonal preconditioning methods through
the lens of two key factors: the choice of basis in the preconditioner, and the
impact of gradient noise from mini-batching. To gain insights, we analyze these
optimizers on quadratic objectives and logistic regression under all four
quadrants. We show that regardless of the basis, there exist instances where
Adam outperforms both GN$^{-1}$ and GN$^{-1/2}$ in full-batch settings.
Conversely, in the stochastic regime, Adam behaves similarly to GN$^{-1/2}$ for
linear regression under a Gaussian data assumption. These theoretical results
are supported by empirical studies on both convex and non-convex objectives.

Conclusion: 提出的InfoRM框架、IBL正则化和MOP指标共同推进了RLHF技术的发展，有效解决了奖励黑客攻击问题。

Abstract: Despite the success of Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) in
aligning language models with human values, reward hacking-or reward
over-optimization-remains a major challenge. We identify two key obstacles to
its mitigation: (1) reward misgeneralization in reward modeling, where reward
models overfit to spurious, preference-irrelevant features; and (2) the lack of
suitable regularization during RL optimization, as existing token-level
constraints often over-restrict the policy space. To address these issues, we
propose InfoRM, an information-theoretic reward modeling framework based on the
Information Bottleneck (IB) principle, which filters out preference-irrelevant
information to alleviate reward misgeneralization. We further observe that
reward-hacked responses manifest as pronounced outliers in InfoRM's IB latent
space, measured by Mahalanobis distance from the SFT-induced distribution.
Motivated by this, we introduce IBL, a distribution-level regularization that
penalizes such deviations, effectively expanding the optimization landscape
while maintaining alignment. We prove that IBL is theoretically equivalent to
the pessimistic RL objective within the IB latent space. Finally, we present
Mahalanobis Outlier Probability (MOP), a statistical metric for quantifying
reward hacking severity, enabling principled hyperparameter tuning and online
mitigation such as early stopping. Extensive experiments across diverse LLMs
and datasets confirm the generality of our findings, the effectiveness of
InfoRM and IBL, and the reliability of MOP as a diagnostic tool-collectively
advancing the state of RLHF.

Abstract: Recent works have proposed accelerating the wall-clock training time of
actor-critic methods via the use of large-scale environment parallelization;
unfortunately, these can sometimes still require large number of environment
interactions to achieve a desired level of performance. Noting that
well-structured representations can improve the generalization and sample
efficiency of deep reinforcement learning (RL) agents, we propose the use of
simplicial embeddings: lightweight representation layers that constrain
embeddings to simplicial structures. This geometric inductive bias results in
sparse and discrete features that stabilize critic bootstrapping and strengthen
policy gradients. When applied to FastTD3, FastSAC, and PPO, simplicial
embeddings consistently improve sample efficiency and final performance across
a variety of continuous- and discrete-control environments, without any loss in
runtime speed.

Abstract: Pruning is a common technique to reduce the compute and storage requirements
of Neural Networks. While conventional approaches typically retrain the model
to recover pruning-induced performance degradation, state-of-the-art Large
Language Model (LLM) pruning methods operate layer-wise, minimizing the
per-layer pruning error on a small calibration dataset to avoid full
retraining, which is considered computationally prohibitive for LLMs. However,
finding the optimal pruning mask is a hard combinatorial problem and solving it
to optimality is intractable. Existing methods hence rely on greedy heuristics
that ignore the weight interactions in the pruning objective. In this work, we
instead consider the convex relaxation of these combinatorial constraints and
solve the resulting problem using the Frank-Wolfe (FW) algorithm. Our method
drastically reduces the per-layer pruning error, outperforms strong baselines
on state-of-the-art GPT architectures, and remains memory-efficient. We provide

TL;DR: 该论文评估了深度学习模型在千米尺度天气数据降尺度任务中的表现，发现现有模型在地理泛化和物理一致性方面存在不足，并提出使用功率谱密度损失函数来改进模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 千米尺度天气数据对实际应用至关重要，但传统天气模拟计算成本高。深度学习模型提供了更快的替代方案，但其可靠性仍受质疑，因为现有评估主要使用标准机器学习指标而非基于大气物理学的洞察。

Method: 对最先进的深度学习模型进行基准测试，引入基于物理学的诊断方法来评估性能，特别关注地理泛化和物理一致性。提出使用功率谱密度损失函数来改进模型。

Result: 实验显示，即使在欧洲中部训练表现良好的模型（如CorrDiff），也难以泛化到其他地区（如伊比利亚、摩洛哥或斯堪的纳维亚）。模型还无法准确捕捉从预测速度场导出的二阶变量（如散度和涡度）。

Conclusion: 深度学习天气降尺度模型在地理泛化和物理一致性方面存在挑战。提出的功率谱密度损失函数能经验性地改善地理泛化能力，通过重建小尺度物理结构来提高模型性能。

Abstract: Kilometer-scale weather data is crucial for real-world applications but
remains computationally intensive to produce using traditional weather
simulations. An emerging solution is to use deep learning models, which offer a
faster alternative for climate downscaling. However, their reliability is still
in question, as they are often evaluated using standard machine learning
metrics rather than insights from atmospheric and weather physics. This paper
benchmarks recent state-of-the-art deep learning models and introduces
physics-inspired diagnostics to evaluate their performance and reliability,
with a particular focus on geographic generalization and physical consistency.
Our experiments show that, despite the seemingly strong performance of models
such as CorrDiff, when trained on a limited set of European geographies (e.g.,
central Europe), they struggle to generalize to other regions such as Iberia,
Morocco in the south, or Scandinavia in the north. They also fail to accurately
capture second-order variables such as divergence and vorticity derived from
predicted velocity fields. These deficiencies appear even in in-distribution
geographies, indicating challenges in producing physically consistent
predictions. We propose a simple initial solution: introducing a power spectral
density loss function that empirically improves geographic generalization by
encouraging the reconstruction of small-scale physical structures. The code for
reproducing the experimental results can be found at

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个两阶段强化学习算法，通过聚类方法有效利用块马尔可夫决策过程的结构特性，将遗憾从O(√T+n²)改进为O(√T+n)，并在特定BMDP类上达到渐近最优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高维状态和动作空间使得强化学习在实际应用中不切实际，但许多环境存在可被利用的结构特性。块马尔可夫决策过程能够建模具有大观测空间但由潜在状态决定动态的问题，需要开发能有效利用这种结构的算法。

Method: 采用两阶段算法：第一阶段通过随机探索学习潜在结构，第二阶段切换到适应已发现结构的乐观引导策略。利用聚类方法准确估计潜在状态。

Result: 算法在可聚类的BMDP类上实现了O(√T+n)的遗憾，显著优于先前最好的O(√T+n²)界限，特别是在n较大时。证明在该类BMDP上无法获得更低的遗憾，达到渐近最优。

Conclusion: 准确估计潜在状态确实能有效加速学习，所提出的两阶段算法在特定BMDP类上达到渐近最优性能，为利用环境结构改进强化学习提供了理论基础。

Abstract: The curse of dimensionality renders Reinforcement Learning (RL) impractical
in many real-world settings with exponentially large state and action spaces.
Yet, many environments exhibit exploitable structure that can accelerate
learning. To formalize this idea, we study RL in Block Markov Decision
Processes (BMDPs). BMDPs model problems with large observation spaces, but
where transition dynamics are fully determined by latent states. Recent
advances in clustering methods have enabled the efficient recovery of this
latent structure. However, a regret analysis that exploits these techniques to
determine their impact on learning performance remained open. We are now
addressing this gap by providing a regret analysis that explicitly leverages
clustering, demonstrating that accurate latent state estimation can indeed
effectively speed up learning.
  Concretely, this paper analyzes a two-phase RL algorithm for BMDPs that first
learns the latent structure through random exploration and then switches to an
optimism-guided strategy adapted to the uncovered structure. This algorithm
achieves a regret that is $O(\sqrt{T}+n)$ on a large class of BMDPs susceptible
to clustering. Here, $T$ denotes the number of time steps, $n$ is the
cardinality of the observation space, and the Landau notation $O(\cdot)$ holds
up to constants and polylogarithmic factors. This improves the best prior
bound, $O(\sqrt{T}+n^2)$, especially when $n$ is large. Moreover, we prove that
no algorithm can achieve lower regret uniformly on this same class of BMDPs.
This establishes that, on this class, the algorithm achieves asymptotic
optimality.

Method: 使用定制编码器顺序整合不同类型数据，通过神经网络进行多保真度回归。采用双连接系统：所有编码输入的连接和最终输出的加性连接，使模型能够利用数据集间的相关性并确保每个级别进行加性修正。

Result: 在数值基准和真实案例研究中证明，该方法能可靠整合多模态数据并提供准确预测，在时间和参数变化泛化时保持性能。

Conclusion: 该渐进式多保真度代理模型能有效解决多模态数据整合问题，防止新数据集成时性能下降，并基于可用输入自动调整预测。

Abstract: Highly accurate datasets from numerical or physical experiments are often
expensive and time-consuming to acquire, posing a significant challenge for
applications that require precise evaluations, potentially across multiple
scenarios and in real-time. Even building sufficiently accurate surrogate
models can be extremely challenging with limited high-fidelity data.
Conversely, less expensive, low-fidelity data can be computed more easily and
encompass a broader range of scenarios. By leveraging multi-fidelity
information, prediction capabilities of surrogates can be improved. However, in
practical situations, data may be different in types, come from sources of
different modalities, and not be concurrently available, further complicating
the modeling process. To address these challenges, we introduce a progressive
multi-fidelity surrogate model. This model can sequentially incorporate diverse
data types using tailored encoders. Multi-fidelity regression from the encoded
inputs to the target quantities of interest is then performed using neural
networks. Input information progressively flows from lower to higher fidelity
levels through two sets of connections: concatenations among all the encoded
inputs, and additive connections among the final outputs. This dual connection
system enables the model to exploit correlations among different datasets while
ensuring that each level makes an additive correction to the previous level
without altering it. This approach prevents performance degradation as new
input data are integrated into the model and automatically adapts predictions
based on the available inputs. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach
on numerical benchmarks and a real-world case study, showing that it reliably
integrates multi-modal data and provides accurate predictions, maintaining
performance when generalizing across time and parameter variations.

Conclusion: TGPS方法通过张量分解和高效优化策略，成功解决了现有PDE求解器的效率和可扩展性限制，为大规模PDE求解提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Machine learning solvers for partial differential equations (PDEs) have
attracted growing interest. However, most existing approaches, such as neural
network solvers, rely on stochastic training, which is inefficient and
typically requires a great many training epochs. Gaussian process
(GP)/kernel-based solvers, while mathematical principled, suffer from
scalability issues when handling large numbers of collocation points often
needed for challenging or higher-dimensional PDEs.
  To overcome these limitations, we propose TGPS, a tensor-GP-based solver that
models factor functions along each input dimension using one-dimensional GPs
and combines them via tensor decomposition to approximate the full solution.
This design reduces the task to learning a collection of one-dimensional GPs,
substantially lowering computational complexity, and enabling scalability to
massive collocation sets.
  For efficient nonlinear PDE solving, we use a partial freezing strategy and
Newton's method to linerize the nonlinear terms. We then develop an alternating
least squares (ALS) approach that admits closed-form updates, thereby
substantially enhancing the training efficiency. We establish theoretical
guarantees on the expressivity of our model, together with convergence proof
and error analysis under standard regularity assumptions. Experiments on
several benchmark PDEs demonstrate that our method achieves superior accuracy
and efficiency compared to existing approaches.

Abstract: Forecasting urban phenomena such as housing prices and public health
indicators requires the effective integration of various geospatial data.
Current methods primarily utilize task-specific models, while recent foundation
models for spatial representations often support only limited modalities and
lack multimodal fusion capabilities. To overcome these challenges, we present
UrbanFusion, a Geo-Foundation Model (GeoFM) that features Stochastic Multimodal
Fusion (SMF). The framework employs modality-specific encoders to process
different types of inputs, including street view imagery, remote sensing data,
cartographic maps, and points of interest (POIs) data. These multimodal inputs
are integrated via a Transformer-based fusion module that learns unified
representations. An extensive evaluation across 41 tasks in 56 cities worldwide
demonstrates UrbanFusion's strong generalization and predictive performance
compared to state-of-the-art GeoAI models. Specifically, it 1) outperforms
prior foundation models on location-encoding, 2) allows multimodal input during
inference, and 3) generalizes well to regions unseen during training.
UrbanFusion can flexibly utilize any subset of available modalities for a given
location during both pretraining and inference, enabling broad applicability
across diverse data availability scenarios. All source code is available at

Motivation: 强化学习已成为训练大语言模型的核心方法，但缺乏类似预训练的可预测扩展方法论，无法评估算法改进对RL计算扩展的影响。

Method: 进行了超过40万GPU小时的大规模系统研究，拟合RL训练的S型计算-性能曲线，分析各种设计选择对渐近性能和计算效率的影响。

Result: 发现不同配方的渐近性能差异显著；损失聚合、归一化、课程学习和离策略算法等细节主要影响计算效率而非渐近性能；稳定可扩展的配方遵循可预测的扩展轨迹。

Conclusion: 提出了科学分析RL扩展的框架和实用配方ScaleRL，成功在10万GPU小时的单一RL运行中预测验证性能，使RL训练更接近预训练的可预测性。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has become central to training large language
models (LLMs), yet the field lacks predictive scaling methodologies comparable
to those established for pre-training. Despite rapidly rising compute budgets,
there is no principled understanding of how to evaluate algorithmic
improvements for scaling RL compute. We present the first large-scale
systematic study, amounting to more than 400,000 GPU-hours, that defines a
principled framework for analyzing and predicting RL scaling in LLMs. We fit
sigmoidal compute-performance curves for RL training and ablate a wide range of
common design choices to analyze their effects on asymptotic performance and
compute efficiency. We observe: (1) Not all recipes yield similar asymptotic
performance, (2) Details such as loss aggregation, normalization, curriculum,
and off-policy algorithm primarily modulate compute efficiency without
materially shifting the asymptote, and (3) Stable, scalable recipes follow
predictable scaling trajectories, enabling extrapolation from smaller-scale
runs. Combining these insights, we propose a best-practice recipe, ScaleRL, and
demonstrate its effectiveness by successfully scaling and predicting validation
performance on a single RL run scaled up to 100,000 GPU-hours. Our work
provides both a scientific framework for analyzing scaling in RL and a
practical recipe that brings RL training closer to the predictability long
achieved in pre-training.

Conclusion: 结合拓扑和谱洞察对于推进时序图学习前沿具有强大潜力。

Abstract: Temporal graph classification plays a critical role in applications such as
cybersecurity, brain connectivity analysis, social dynamics, and traffic
monitoring. Despite its significance, this problem remains underexplored
compared to temporal link prediction or node forecasting. Existing methods
often rely on snapshot-based or recurrent architectures that either lose
fine-grained temporal information or struggle with long-range dependencies.
Moreover, local message-passing approaches suffer from oversmoothing and
oversquashing, limiting their ability to capture complex temporal structures.
  We introduce T3former, a novel Topological Temporal Transformer that
leverages sliding-window topological and spectral descriptors as first-class
tokens, integrated via a specialized Descriptor-Attention mechanism. This
design preserves temporal fidelity, enhances robustness, and enables principled
cross-modal fusion without rigid discretization. T3former achieves
state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks, including dynamic
social networks, brain functional connectivity datasets, and traffic networks.
It also offers theoretical guarantees of stability under temporal and
structural perturbations. Our results highlight the power of combining
topological and spectral insights for advancing the frontier of temporal graph
learning.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) for the Markov Decision Process (MDP) has emerged
in many security-related applications, such as autonomous driving, financial
decisions, and drone/robot algorithms. In order to improve the
robustness/defense of RL systems against adversaries, studying various
adversarial attacks on RL systems is very important. Most previous work
considered deterministic adversarial attack strategies in MDP, which the
recipient (victim) agent can defeat by reversing the deterministic attacks. In
this paper, we propose a provably ``invincible'' or ``uncounterable'' type of
adversarial attack on RL. The attackers apply a rate-distortion
information-theoretic approach to randomly change agents' observations of the
transition kernel (or other properties) so that the agent gains zero or very
limited information about the ground-truth kernel (or other properties) during
the training. We derive an information-theoretic lower bound on the recipient
agent's reward regret and show the impact of rate-distortion attacks on
state-of-the-art model-based and model-free algorithms. We also extend this
notion of an information-theoretic approach to other types of adversarial
attack, such as state observation attacks.

Abstract: The computation and memory costs of large language models kept increasing
over last decade, which reached over the scale of 1T parameters. To address the
challenges from the large scale models, model compression techniques such as
low-rank decomposition have been explored. Previous model decomposition works
have focused on weight decomposition to avoid costly runtime decomposition,
whose latency often significantly exceeds the benefits from decomposition
(e.g., 38% more end-to-end latency when running Llama2-7b on A100 with 4K
sequence length with activation decomposition compared to no decomposition). In
this work, we debunk such observations and report that the input decomposition
can be significantly beneficial with a proper choice of decomposition algorithm
and hardware support. We adopt progressive decomposition algorithm, Lanczos
algorithm, and design a co-accelerator architecture for the decomposition
algorithm. To address the memory- boundness of the decomposition operation, we
introduce a novel compute replication methodology that moves the op- eration
toward compute-bound region, which enables 6.2x speedup in our evaluation. We
also develop an output shape- preserving computation scheme that eliminates
decomposi- tion costs in consecutive layers. To compensate model quality loss
from compression, we introduce a multi-track decom- position approach that
separately handles outlier channels for high accuracy and low perplexity with
minimal compu- tational costs. Combined together, our accelerator, D-com,
provides 22% end-to-end latency improvements compared to A100 GPU at the cost
of small model quality degradation (e.g., 3% on AI2 Reasoning Challenge task).

Abstract: The growing demand for real-time processing in artificial intelligence
applications, particularly those involving Convolutional Neural Networks
(CNNs), has highlighted the need for efficient computational solutions.
Conventional processors, very often, fall short in balancing performance, power
consumption, and latency, especially in embedded systems and edge computing
platforms. Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) offer a promising
alternative, combining high performance with energy efficiency and
reconfigurability. The presented framework addresses the complex and demanding
computations of CNNs on FPGAs maintaining full precision in all neural network
parameters. Specifically, our framework is based on Darknet which is very
widely used for the design of CNNs and allows the designer, by using a similar
input to that given to Darknet, to efficiently implement a CNN in a
heterogeneous system comprising of CPUs and FPGAs. When compared with the FPGA
frameworks that support quantization, our solution aims to offer similar
performance and/or energy efficiency without any degradation on the NN
accuracy.

Conclusion: F-BFQ加速器有效提升了BFP量化LLM在边缘设备上的推理性能，支持灵活的量化变体切换。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have become increasingly prominent for daily
tasks, from improving sound-totext translation to generating additional frames
for the latest video games. With the help of LLM inference frameworks, such as
llama.cpp, which support optimizations such as KV-caching and quantization, it
is now easier than ever to deploy LLMs on edge devices. Quantization is
fundamental to enable LLMs on resource-constrained edge devices, and llama.cpp
utilizes block floating point (BFP) quantization to drastically reduce the bit
width of weights and input tensors, the memory footprint, and the computational
power required to run LLMs. LLMs are typically quantized with mixed BFP
quantization across the model layers to reduce the loss of model accuracy due
to quantization. Therefore, to efficiently accelerate across the layers of
BFP-quantized LLMs, specialized accelerators need to support different BFP
variants without reconfiguration. To address this issue, we propose a Flexible
Block FloatingPoint Quantization (F-BFQ) accelerator, which can dynamically
switch between two BFP quantization variants and perform matrix multiplication
(MatMul) operations. Our initial F-BFQ accelerator design, deployed on the AMD
Kria board, reduces inference time by 1.4x on average over the Arm NEON-based
CPU execution across three BFP quantized LLMs while achieving 5.2 tokens per
second (~3.9 words per second).

Conclusion: Dodoor通过批量信息更新和创新的负载评分机制，在显著减少通信开销的同时，实现了更好的调度性能和资源利用率。

Abstract: This paper introduces Dodoor, an efficient randomized decentralized scheduler
designed for task scheduling in modern data centers. Dodoor leverages advanced
research on the weighted balls-into-bins model with b-batched setting. Unlike
other decentralized schedulers that rely on real-time probing of remote
servers, Dodoor makes scheduling decisions based on cached server information,
which is updated in batches, to reduce communication overheads. To schedule
tasks with dynamic, multidimensional resource requirements in heterogeneous
cluster, Dodoor uses a novel load score to measure servers' loads for each
scheduled task. This score captures the anti-affinity between servers and tasks
in contrast to the commonly used heuristic of counting pending tasks to balance
load. On a 101-node heterogeneous cluster, Dodoor is evaluated using two
workloads: (i) simulated Azure virtual machines placements and (ii) real
serverless Python functions executions in Docker. The evaluation shows that
Dodoor reduces scheduling messages by 55--66% on both workloads. Dodoor can
also increase throughput by up to 33.2% and 21.5%, reduce mean makespan latency
by 12.1% and 7.2%, and improve tail latency by 21.9% and 24.6% across the two
workloads.

TL;DR: BanaServe是一个动态编排框架，通过层级权重迁移、注意力级KV缓存迁移和全局KV缓存存储共享，解决了解耦LLM服务中的资源分配不平衡、负载不均和缓存感知路由导致的效率问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前解耦LLM服务系统面临三个关键限制：静态资源分配无法适应动态工作负载、预填充和解码阶段固有负载不平衡、前缀缓存感知路由导致负载分布倾斜。这些问题导致资源浪费、SLO违规和效率低下。

Method: BanaServe引入层级权重迁移、注意力级KV缓存迁移和全局KV缓存存储共享，支持粗粒度（层级）和细粒度（注意力级）负载重分配，实现最小延迟开销的动态资源编排。

Result: 相比vLLM，BanaServe实现1.2x-3.9x更高吞吐量和3.9%-78.4%更低总处理时间；相比DistServe，吞吐量提升1.1x-2.8x，延迟降低1.4%-70.1%。

Conclusion: BanaServe通过动态资源编排和缓存管理机制，有效解决了LLM服务系统中的资源利用率和负载平衡问题，显著提升了服务性能。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in AI infrastructure,
driving the need for high throughput, resource efficient serving systems.
Disaggregated LLM serving, which separates prompt prefill from auto-regressive
decode, has emerged as a promising architecture by isolating their
heterogeneous compute and memory demands. However, current disaggregated
systems face three key limitations: (i) static resource allocation cannot adapt
to highly dynamic workloads, causing over-provisioning that wastes resources or
under-provisioning that violates service level objectives (SLOs); (ii) inherent
load imbalance between prefill and decode stages, where prefill is
compute-bound and decode is memory-bound, causes under-utilization in one tier
while the other becomes a bottleneck; and (iii) prefix cache aware routing
skews load distribution, as high cache hit rate prefill nodes attract
disproportionately more requests, further degrading balance and efficiency. To
address these issues, we present BanaServe, a dynamic orchestration framework
that continuously rebalances computational and memory resources across prefill
and decode instances while eliminating hotspots induced by cache. BanaServe
introduces layer level weight migration, attention level Key Value Cache (KV
Cache) migration, and Global KV Cache Store sharing with layer wise overlapped
transmission, enabling both coarse grained (layer level) and fine grained
(attention level) load redistribution with minimal latency overhead. These
mechanisms allow routers to perform purely load aware scheduling, unconstrained
by cache placement. Compared to vLLM, BanaServe achieves 1.2x-3.9x higher
throughput with 3.9%-78.4% lower total processing time, and outperforms
DistServe by 1.1x-2.8x in throughput with 1.4%-70.1% latency reduction.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 最大权重独立集问题是一个重要的NP难优化问题，现有的实用精确算法和启发式算法使用各种数据缩减规则，但这些方法主要是顺序执行的。本文旨在开发分布式并行算法来处理更大规模的图数据。

Method: 提出了分布式内存并行缩减算法，包括分布式reduce-and-greedy和reduce-and-peel启发式算法，支持异步处理，能够处理超过十亿顶点和170亿边的大规模图。

Result: 在1024个处理器上的实验显示，分布式缩减算法具有良好的可扩展性和缩减效果。异步reduce-and-peel方法在36个真实世界图上平均加速33倍，解质量接近顺序算法。reduce-and-greedy算法平均加速达50倍，但解质量较低。

Conclusion: 分布式并行算法能够有效处理大规模图的最大权重独立集问题，在保持解质量的同时显著提升计算效率，突破了顺序算法的规模限制。

Abstract: Finding maximum-weight independent sets in graphs is an important NP-hard
optimization problem. Given a vertex-weighted graph $G$, the task is to find a
subset of pairwise non-adjacent vertices of $G$ with maximum weight. Most
recently published practical exact algorithms and heuristics for this problem
use a variety of data-reduction rules to compute (near-)optimal solutions.
Applying these rules results in an equivalent instance of reduced size. An
optimal solution to the reduced instance can be easily used to construct an
optimal solution for the original input.
  In this work, we present the first distributed-memory parallel reduction
algorithms for this problem, targeting graphs beyond the scale of previous
sequential approaches. Furthermore, we propose the first distributed
reduce-and-greedy and reduce-and-peel algorithms for finding a maximum weight
independent set heuristically.
  In our practical evaluation, our experiments on up to $1024$ processors
demonstrate good scalability of our distributed reduce algorithms while
maintaining good reduction impact. Our asynchronous reduce-and-peel approach
achieves an average speedup of $33\times$ over a sequential state-of-the-art
reduce-and-peel approach on 36 real-world graphs with a solution quality close
to the sequential algorithm. Our reduce-and-greedy algorithms even achieve
average speedups of up to $50\times$ at the cost of a lower solution quality.
Moreover, our distributed approach allows us to consider graphs with more than
one billion vertices and 17 billion edges.

TL;DR: 提出了一种服务级能耗模型，考虑微服务跨容器执行的分布式特性，特别关注网络和存储等辅助服务的能耗影响，实验显示忽略这些因素可能导致能耗低估达63%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 微服务架构虽提供灵活性和可扩展性，但增加了云资源需求，导致能耗和碳排放上升。现有研究主要关注容器级CPU和内存能耗，忽视了跨容器服务交互（特别是网络和存储）的能耗影响。

Method: 开发了服务级能耗模型，捕捉微服务在容器间的分布式执行特性，并构建实验工具测量CPU、内存、网络和存储组件的能耗。

Result: 实验验证表明，忽略网络和存储组件会导致辅助服务能耗低估高达63%，突显了全面能耗评估的必要性。

Conclusion: 微服务架构的能耗评估需要更全面的方法，必须包含网络和存储等辅助服务组件，以准确设计能效优化的微服务架构。

Abstract: Microservice architectures have become the dominant paradigm for cloud-native
systems, offering flexibility and scalability. However, this shift has also led
to increased demand for cloud resources, contributing to higher energy
consumption and carbon emissions. While existing research has focused on
measuring fine-grained energy usage of CPU and memory at the container level,
or on system-wide assessments, these approaches often overlook the energy
impact of cross-container service interactions, especially those involving
network and storage for auxiliary services such as observability and system
monitoring. To address this gap, we introduce a service-level energy model that
captures the distributed nature of microservice execution across containers.
Our model is supported by an experimentation tool that accounts for energy
consumption not just in CPU and memory, but also in network and storage
components. We validate our approach through extensive experimentation with
diverse experiment configurations of auxiliary services for a popular
open-source cloud-native microservice application. Results show that omitting
network and storage can lead to an underestimation of auxiliary service energy
use by up to 63%, highlighting the need for more comprehensive energy
assessments in the design of energy-efficient microservice architectures.

Conclusion: ARES系统通过自适应解码重调度有效解决了LLM推理中的工作负载不平衡问题，显著提升了系统性能和稳定性。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) inference has emerged as a fundamental paradigm.
In real-world scenarios, variations in output length cause severe workload
imbalance in the decode phase, particularly for long-output reasoning tasks.
Existing systems, such as PD disaggregation architectures, rely on static
prefill-to-decode scheduling, which often results in SLO violations and OOM
failures under evolving decode workloads.
  In this paper, we propose ARES, an adaptive decoding rescheduling system
powered by length prediction to anticipate future workloads. Our core
contributions include: (1) A lightweight and continuous LLM-native prediction
method that leverages LLM hidden state to model remaining generation length
with high precision (reducing MAE by 49.42%) and low overhead (cutting
predictor parameters by 93.28%); (2) A rescheduling solution in decode phase
with : A dynamic balancing mechanism that integrates current and predicted
workloads, reducing P99 TPOT by 74.77% and achieving up to 2.24 times higher
goodput.

Abstract: We present the Federated Inference Resource Scheduling Toolkit (FIRST), a
framework enabling Inference-as-a-Service across distributed High-Performance
Computing (HPC) clusters. FIRST provides cloud-like access to diverse AI
models, like Large Language Models (LLMs), on existing HPC infrastructure.
Leveraging Globus Auth and Globus Compute, the system allows researchers to run

secure, and scalable AI inference in scientific workflows, allowing researchers
to generate billions of tokens daily on-premises without relying on commercial
cloud infrastructure.

Conclusion: 输出集方法产生了高度通用的结果，统一了多个分布式计算问题，并提供了适用于更强任务表述的不可能性证明。

Abstract: This paper explores necessary and sufficient system conditions to solve
distributed tasks with binary outputs (\textit{i.e.}, tasks with output values
in $\{0,1\}$). We focus on the distinct output sets of values a task can
produce (intentionally disregarding validity and value multiplicity),
considering that some processes may output no value. In a distributed system
with $n$ processes, of which up to $t \leq n$ can crash, we provide a complete
characterization of the tight conditions on $n$ and $t$ under which every class
of tasks with binary outputs is solvable, for both synchronous and asynchronous
systems. This output-set approach yields highly general results: it unifies
multiple distributed computing problems, such as binary consensus and symmetry
breaking, and it produces impossibility proofs that hold for stronger task
formulations, including those that consider validity, account for value
multiplicity, or move beyond binary outputs.
