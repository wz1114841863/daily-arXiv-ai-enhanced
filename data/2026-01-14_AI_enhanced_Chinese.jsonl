It is known to be NP-hard. Still, many tools exist to find sub-optimal circuits to implement a function. In electronics, such tools are known as synthesisers. However, these synthesisers aim to implement very large functions (a whole electronic chip). In cryptography, the focus is on small functions, hence the necessity for new dedicated tools for small functions. Several tools exist to implement small functions. They differ by their algorithmic approach (some are based on Depth-First-Search as introduced by Ullrich in 2011, some are based on SAT-solvers like the tool desgined by Stoffelen in 2016, some non-generic tools use subfield decomposition) and by their optimisation criteria (some optimise for circuit size, others for circuit depth, and some for side-channel-protected implementations). However, these tools are limited to functions operating on less than 5 bits, sometimes 6 bits for quadratic functions, or to very simple functions. The limitation lies in a high computing time. We propose a new tool (The tool is provided alongside the IEEE article with CodeOcean and at https://github.com/seduval/implem-quad-sbox) to implement quadratic functions up to 9 bits within AND-depth 1, minimising the number of AND gates. This tool is more time-efficient than previous ones, allowing to explore larger implementations than others on 6 bits or less and allows to reach larger sizes, up to 9 bits.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u9488\u5bf99\u4f4d\u4ee5\u5185\u4e8c\u6b21\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u65b0\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u5728AND-depth 1\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b\u6700\u5c0f\u5316AND\u95e8\u6570\u91cf\uff0c\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u5de5\u5177\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u3002", "motivation": "\u5bc6\u7801\u5b66\u9700\u8981\u9488\u5bf9\u5c0f\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u4e13\u7528\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u5de5\u5177\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e5-6\u4f4d\u51fd\u6570\u6216\u8ba1\u7b97\u65f6\u95f4\u8fc7\u957f\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u5904\u7406\u66f4\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u7684\u51fd\u6570\u5b9e\u73b0\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u65b0\u5de5\u5177\uff08\u63d0\u4f9bCodeOcean\u548cGitHub\u4ee3\u7801\uff09\uff0c\u4e13\u95e8\u4f18\u5316\u4e8c\u6b21\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u5728AND-depth 1\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b\u6700\u5c0f\u5316AND\u95e8\u6570\u91cf\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u3002", "result": "\u65b0\u5de5\u5177\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u5de5\u5177\u65f6\u95f4\u6548\u7387\u66f4\u9ad8\uff0c\u80fd\u63a2\u7d226\u4f4d\u53ca\u4ee5\u4e0b\u66f4\u5927\u5b9e\u73b0\uff0c\u5e76\u80fd\u5904\u7406\u9ad8\u8fbe9\u4f4d\u7684\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u7a81\u7834\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u5de5\u5177\u7684\u9650\u5236\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6210\u529f\u5f00\u53d1\u51fa\u80fd\u5904\u7406\u66f4\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u4e8c\u6b21\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u5b9e\u73b0\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u586b\u8865\u4e86\u5bc6\u7801\u5b66\u4e2d\u5c0f\u51fd\u6570\u4f18\u5316\u5de5\u5177\u7684\u7a7a\u767d\u3002"}}

In this study we investigate the spatiotemporal structure of electrical potential dynamics in oyster mushroom (\\textit{Pleurotus ostreatus}) mycelium colonising a wood-shavings substrate. Electrical signals were recorded using an eight-channel star-shaped differential electrode array providing angular resolution around a central region of colonised substrate. We analyse spike statistics, bursting behaviour, inter-channel correlations, and event-based propagation delays. The results reveal strong directional heterogeneity in spiking frequency and amplitude, clustered bursting dynamics, partial and localised coupling between channels, and reproducible propagation patterns across spatial sectors. Electrical bursts originate preferentially in specific directions and recruit other regions with with characteristic delays ranging from seconds to minutes to hours.

A recursive rank-reducing strategy and a reverse Cuthill-Mckee (RCM) permutation are introduced to align high weights towards the diagonal with the block-diagonal hierarchy, maximising off-diagonal compressibility (because they are touched only once).

However, the rising operational energy consumption has emerged as a critical bottleneck and a major sustainability concern. Dynamic Voltage and Frequency Scaling (DVFS) is a well-known technique used to reduce energy consumption, and thus improve energy-efficiency, since it requires little effort and works with existing hardware. Reducing the energy consumption of training and inference of Large Language Models (LLMs) through DVFS or power capping is feasible: related work has shown energy savings can be significant, but at the cost of significant slowdowns. In this work, we focus on reducing waste in LLM operations: i.e., reducing energy consumption without losing performance. We propose a fine-grained, kernel-level, DVFS approach that explores new frequency configurations, and prove these save more energy than previous, pass- or iteration-level solutions. For example, for a GPT-3 training run, a pass-level approach could reduce energy consumption by 2% (without losing performance), while our kernel-level approach saves as much as 14.6% (with a 0.6% slowdown).

A Pareto-Front Analysis of DNN Partitioning for Edge Inference", "comment": null, "summary": "The deployment of deep neural networks (DNNs) on resource-constrained edge devices is frequently hindered by their significant computational and memory requirements. While partitioning and distributing a DNN across multiple devices is a well-established strategy to mitigate this challenge, prior research has largely focused on single-objective optimization, such as minimizing latency or maximizing throughput. This paper challenges that view by reframing DNN partitioning as a multi-objective optimization problem. We argue that in real-world scenarios, a complex trade-off between latency and throughput exists, which is further complicated by network variability. To address this, we introduce ParetoPipe, an open-source framework that leverages Pareto front analysis to systematically identify optimal partitioning strategies that balance these competing objectives.\n  Our contributions are threefold: we benchmark pipeline partitioned inference on a heterogeneous testbed of Raspberry Pis and a GPU-equipped edge server; we identify Pareto-optimal points to analyze the latency-throughput trade-off under varying network conditions; and we release a flexible, open-source framework to facilitate distributed inference and benchmarking.

Recent advances in natural language processing and agentic AI offer ways to improve how organizations share and use data. But many barriers remain. Today's tools require technical skills and multiple roles to discover, request, and query data. Automating data access using enterprise AI agents is limited by the means to discover and autonomously access distributed data. Current solutions either compromise governance or break agentic workflows through manual approvals. To close this gap, we introduce Data Product MCP integrated in a data product marketplace. This data marketplace, already in use at large enterprises, enables AI agents to find, request, and query enterprise data products while enforcing data contracts in real time without lowering governance standards. The system is built on the Model Context Protocol (MCP) and links the AI-driven marketplace with cloud platforms such as Snowflake, Databricks, and Google Cloud Platform. It supports semantic discovery of data products based on business context, automates access control by validating generated queries against approved business purposes using AI-driven checks, and enforces contracts in real time by blocking unauthorized queries before they run. We assessed the system with feedback from $n=16$ experts in data governance. Our qualitative evaluation demonstrates effectiveness through enterprise scenarios such as customer analytics.

Code can be found at: https://github.com/glam-imperial/AffectEffect", "summary": "Generalisation to unseen subjects in EEG-based emotion classification remains a challenge due to high inter-and intra-subject variability. Continual learning (CL) poses a promising solution by learning from a sequence of tasks while mitigating catastrophic forgetting. Regularisation-based CL approaches, such as Elastic Weight Consolidation (EWC), Synaptic Intelligence (SI), and Memory Aware Synapses (MAS), are commonly used as baselines in EEG-based CL studies, yet their suitability for this problem remains underexplored. This study theoretically and empirically finds that regularisation-based CL methods show limited performance for EEG-based emotion classification on the DREAMER and SEED datasets. We identify a fundamental misalignment in the stability-plasticity trade-off, where regularisation-based methods prioritise mitigating catastrophic forgetting (backward transfer) over adapting to new subjects (forward transfer). We investigate this limitation under subject-incremental sequences and observe that: (1) the heuristics for estimating parameter importance become less reliable under noisy data and covariate shift, (2) gradients on parameters deemed important by these heuristics often interfere with gradient updates required for new subjects, moving optimisation away from the minimum, (3) importance values accumulated across tasks over-constrain the model, and (4) performance is sensitive to subject order.

These workloads often rely on Cholesky (POTRF) decomposition and its supporting operations, triangular solves (TRSM) and symmetric rank-k updates (SYRK), which together form the computational core for solving symmetric positive-definite systems. To accelerate these kernels, we present a portable, mixed-precision solver designed for Matrix Processing Units (MXUs), including NVIDIA Tensor Cores (H200) and AMD Matrix Cores (MI300X). Our algorithm builds on a nested recursive formulation in which Cholesky exposes parallelism through recursive decomposition of its TRSM and SYRK sub-problems. This structure yields a hierarchical recursion that maximizes GEMM throughput while enabling fine-grained control over numerical precision. We introduce a custom recursive data structure that assigns low-precision FP16 arithmetic to large off-diagonal blocks, while preserving high precision on diagonal blocks to ensure numerical stability. The solver is implemented in Julia, leveraging array programming, multiple dispatch, and dynamic type inference to enable seamless expression of mixed-precision computation. This design provides a high-level, hardware-agnostic interface while efficiently interfacing with low-level vendor libraries for backend portability. On H200, our recursive FP64 SYRK achieves a 14x speedup over cuBLAS, while mixed-precision delivers up to 27x speedup in SYRK and 5x in TRSM over full-precision baselines. This results in a 5x overall speedup for Cholesky versus cuSOLVER FP64, with 100x better accuracy than pure FP16 while retaining 88% of its peak speedup. Comparable performance and accuracy trends are observed on MI300X, demonstrating broad applicability across GPUs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u9488\u5bf9\u77e9\u9635\u5904\u7406\u5355\u5143\uff08MXUs\uff09\u7684\u53ef\u79fb\u690d\u6df7\u5408\u7cbe\u5ea6\u5bf9\u79f0\u7ebf\u6027\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9012\u5f52\u5206\u89e3Cholesky\u7684TRSM\u548cSYRK\u5b50\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u6570\u503c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u52a0\u901f\u3002", "motivation": "\u5bf9\u79f0\u7ebf\u6027\u6c42\u89e3\u5728\u79d1\u5b66\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u5de5\u7a0b\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u5e7f\u6cdb\u4f7f\u7528\uff0c\u4f46\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u77e9\u9635\u5904\u7406\u5355\u5143\u4e0a\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u65e2\u80fd\u5229\u7528\u4f4e\u7cbe\u5ea6\u8ba1\u7b97\u52a0\u901f\u53c8\u80fd\u4fdd\u6301\u6570\u503c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u5d4c\u5957\u9012\u5f52\u516c\u5f0f\uff0c\u5c06Cholesky\u5206\u89e3\u4e3aTRSM\u548cSYRK\u5b50\u95ee\u9898\uff1b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u81ea\u5b9a\u4e49\u9012\u5f52\u6570\u636e\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5bf9\u5927\u5757\u975e\u5bf9\u89d2\u533a\u57df\u4f7f\u7528FP16\u4f4e\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u5bf9\u89d2\u533a\u57df\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4ee5\u786e\u4fdd\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff1b\u5728Julia\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u6570\u7ec4\u7f16\u7a0b\u548c\u591a\u5206\u6d3e\u7279\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728NVIDIA H200\u4e0a\uff0c\u9012\u5f52FP64 SYRK\u6bd4cuBLAS\u5feb14\u500d\uff0c\u6df7\u5408\u7cbe\u5ea6SYRK\u6bd4\u5168\u7cbe\u5ea6\u57fa\u7ebf\u5feb27\u500d\uff0cTRSM\u5feb5\u500d\uff1bCholesky\u6bd4cuSOLVER FP64\u5feb5\u500d\uff0c\u7cbe\u5ea6\u6bd4\u7eafFP16\u9ad8100\u500d\uff0c\u4fdd\u630188%\u7684\u5cf0\u503c\u52a0\u901f\uff1b\u5728AMD MI300X\u4e0a\u4e5f\u89c2\u5bdf\u5230\u7c7b\u4f3c\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u7cbe\u5ea6\u9012\u5f52\u7b97\u6cd5\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u5229\u7528\u77e9\u9635\u5904\u7406\u5355\u5143\u7684\u786c\u4ef6\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u6570\u503c\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u663e\u8457\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u4e14\u5177\u6709\u8de8GPU\u5e73\u53f0\u7684\u53ef\u79fb\u690d\u6027\u3002"}}

We propose RewriteNets, a novel neural architecture built on an alternative paradigm: explicit, parallel string rewriting. Each layer in a RewriteNet contains a set of learnable rules. For each position in an input sequence, the layer performs four operations: (1) fuzzy matching of rule patterns, (2) conflict resolution via a differentiable assignment operator to select non-overlapping rewrites, (3) application of the chosen rules to replace input segments with output segments of potentially different lengths, and (4) propagation of untouched tokens. While the discrete assignment of rules is non-differentiable, we employ a straight-through Gumbel-Sinkhorn estimator, enabling stable end-to-end training. We evaluate RewriteNets on algorithmic, compositional, and string manipulation tasks, comparing them against strong LSTM and Transformer baselines. Results show that RewriteNets excel at tasks requiring systematic generalization (achieving 98.7% accuracy on the SCAN benchmark's length split) and are computationally more efficient than Transformers.

However, existing implementations fail to fully exploit the special structure of modern CPU architectures and tensor-product elements, causing their performance \"sweet spot\" to anomalously remain at the low order of $p \\approx 2$, which severely limits the potential of high-order methods. To address this challenge, we design and implement a highly optimized PA operator within the MFEM framework, deeply integrated with a Geometric Multigrid (GMG) preconditioner. Our multi-level optimization strategy includes replacing the original $O(p^6)$ generic algorithm with an efficient $O(p^4)$ one based on tensor factorization, exploiting Voigt symmetry to reduce redundant computations for the elasticity problem, and employing macro-kernel fusion to enhance data locality and break the memory bandwidth bottleneck. Extensive experiments on mainstream x86 and ARM architectures demonstrate that our method successfully shifts the performance \"sweet spot\" to the higher-order region of $p \\ge 6$. Compared to the MFEM baseline, the optimized core operator (kernel) achieves speedups of 7x to 83x, which translates to a 3.6x to 16.8x end-to-end performance improvement in the complete solution process.

Recent CPU architectures integrate specialized Matrix Processing Units (MPUs) that efficiently support matrix outer-product operations, offering new opportunities to overcome this limitation. Leveraging this architectural shift, this work focuses on redesigning the current deposition step of PIC simulations under a matrix-centric execution model.\n  We present MatrixPIC, the first holistic co-design of the deposition kernel, data layout, and incremental particle sorting tailored to the hybrid MPU--VPU SIMD model on modern CPUs. MatrixPIC introduces: (i)~a block-matrix formulation of the current deposition algorithm that maps naturally to MPU outer-product primitives; (ii)~a hybrid execution pipeline that combines MPU-based high-density accumulation with VPU-based data preparation and control flow; and (iii)~an $O(1)$-amortized incremental sorter based on a gapped packed-memory array to preserve data locality for efficient MPU execution.\n  Evaluated on a next-generation HPC platform, MatrixPIC achieves significant performance gains. In Laser-Wakefield Acceleration (LWFA) simulations, it delivers up to $2.63\\times$ speedup in total runtime. For third-order deposition, the core kernel is accelerated by $8.7\\times$ over the baseline and $2.0\\times$ over the best hand-optimized VPU implementation. Moreover, MatrixPIC reaches $83.08\\%$ of theoretical CPU peak performance, nearly $2.8\\times$ higher than a highly optimized CUDA kernel on a data center GPU.

The prevailing editing paradigm, which appends an update matrix to the original parameter matrix, has been shown by some studies to damage key numerical stability indicators (such as condition number and norm), thereby reducing editing performance and general abilities, especially in sequential editing scenario. Although subsequent methods have made some improvements, they remain within the additive framework and have not fundamentally addressed this limitation. To solve this problem, we analyze it from both statistical and mathematical perspectives and conclude that multiplying the original matrix by an orthogonal matrix does not change the numerical stability of the matrix. Inspired by this, different from the previous additive editing paradigm, a multiplicative editing paradigm termed Multiplicative Orthogonal Sequential Editing (MOSE) is proposed. Specifically, we first derive the matrix update in the multiplicative form, the new knowledge is then incorporated into an orthogonal matrix, which is multiplied by the original parameter matrix. In this way, the numerical stability of the edited matrix is unchanged, thereby maintaining editing performance and general abilities. We compared MOSE with several current knowledge editing methods, systematically evaluating their impact on both editing performance and the general abilities across three different LLMs. Experimental results show that MOSE effectively limits deviations in the edited parameter matrix and maintains its numerical stability. Compared to current methods, MOSE achieves a 12.08% improvement in sequential editing performance, while retaining 95.73% of general abilities across downstream tasks.

However, due to memory constraints, MoE models with billions or even trillions of parameters can only be deployed in multi-GPU or even multi-node & multi-GPU based serving systems. Thus, communication has became a major bottleneck in distributed serving systems, especially inter-node communication. Contemporary distributed MoE models are primarily implemented using all-reduce (AR) based tensor parallelism (TP) and all-to-all (A2A) based expert parallelism (EP). However, TP generally exhibits low inter-node efficiency and is thus confined to high-speed intra-node bandwidth. In contrast, EP tends to suffer from load imbalance, especially when the parallel degree is high.\n  In this work, we introduce MixServe, a novel automatic distributed serving system for efficient deployment of MoE models by a novel TP-EP hybrid parallelism based on fused AR-A2A communication algorithm. MixServe begins by evaluating the communication overhead associated with various parallel strategies, taking into account the model hyperparameters and the configurations of network and hardware resources, and then automatically selects the most efficient parallel strategy. Then, we propose the TP-EP hybrid parallelism based on fused AR-A2A communication algorithm that overlaps intra-node AR communication and inter-node A2A communication. Extensive experiments on DeepSeek-R1 and Qwen3 models demonstrate that MixServe achieves superior inference performance, with 1.08~3.80x acceleration in time to first token (TTFT), 1.03~1.66x acceleration in inter-token latency (ITL), and 5.2%~50.3% throughput improvement compared to existing approaches.", "AI": {"tldr": "MixServe\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u7528\u4e8e\u9ad8\u6548\u90e8\u7f72MoE\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u670d\u52a1\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u57fa\u4e8e\u878d\u5408AR-A2A\u901a\u4fe1\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684TP-EP\u6df7\u5408\u5e76\u884c\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u63a8\u7406\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524dMoE\u6a21\u578b\u7531\u4e8e\u5185\u5b58\u9650\u5236\u53ea\u80fd\u5728\u591aGPU/\u591a\u8282\u70b9\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u90e8\u7f72\uff0c\u901a\u4fe1\u6210\u4e3a\u4e3b\u8981\u74f6\u9888\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u7684AR-based TP\u5b58\u5728\u8282\u70b9\u95f4\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u800cA2A-based EP\u5728\u9ad8\u5e76\u884c\u5ea6\u4e0b\u5b58\u5728\u8d1f\u8f7d\u4e0d\u5747\u8861\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "1) \u81ea\u52a8\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0d\u540c\u5e76\u884c\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u901a\u4fe1\u5f00\u9500\uff0c\u8003\u8651\u6a21\u578b\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u548c\u7f51\u7edc\u786c\u4ef6\u914d\u7f6e\uff0c\u9009\u62e9\u6700\u4f18\u7b56\u7565\uff1b2) \u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u878d\u5408AR-A2A\u901a\u4fe1\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684TP-EP\u6df7\u5408\u5e76\u884c\uff0c\u91cd\u53e0\u8282\u70b9\u5185AR\u901a\u4fe1\u548c\u8282\u70b9\u95f4A2A\u901a\u4fe1\u3002", "result": "\u5728DeepSeek-R1\u548cQwen3\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cMixServe\u76f8\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1aTTFT\u52a0\u901f1.08~3.80\u500d\uff0cITL\u52a0\u901f1.03~1.66\u500d\uff0c\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u63d0\u53475.2%~50.3%\u3002", "conclusion": "MixServe\u901a\u8fc7\u521b\u65b0\u7684TP-EP\u6df7\u5408\u5e76\u884c\u548c\u878d\u5408\u901a\u4fe1\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86MoE\u6a21\u578b\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u90e8\u7f72\u4e2d\u7684\u901a\u4fe1\u74f6\u9888\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u63a8\u7406\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

NOVAK adopts a dual-mode architecture consisting of a streamlined fast path designed for production. The optimizer employs custom CUDA kernels that deliver substantial speedups (3-5 for critical operations) while preserving numerical stability under standard stochastic-optimization assumptions. We provide fully developed mathematical formulations for rectified adaptive learning rates, a memory-efficient lookahead mechanism that reduces overhead from O(2p) to O(p + p/k), and the synergistic coupling of complementary optimization components. Theoretical analysis establishes convergence guarantees and elucidates the stability and variance-reduction properties of the method. Extensive empirical evaluation on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, ImageNet, and ImageNette demonstrates NOVAK superiority over 14 contemporary optimizers, including Adam, AdamW, RAdam, Lion, and Adan. Across architectures such as ResNet-50, VGG-16, and ViT, NOVAK consistently achieves state-of-the-art accuracy, and exceptional robustness, attaining very high accuracy on VGG-16/ImageNette demonstrating superior architectural robustness compared to contemporary optimizers.

While recent multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have advanced emotion analysis, they have not been adapted to handle the unique spatiotemporal characteristics of neural signals. We present E^2-LLM (EEG-to-Emotion Large Language Model), the first MLLM framework for interpretable emotion analysis from EEG. E^2-LLM integrates a pretrained EEG encoder with Qwen-based LLMs through learnable projection layers, employing a multi-stage training pipeline that encompasses emotion-discriminative pretraining, cross-modal alignment, and instruction tuning with chain-of-thought reasoning. We design a comprehensive evaluation protocol covering basic emotion prediction, multi-task reasoning, and zero-shot scenario understanding.

Model quantization improves energy and memory efficiency through representing model parameters by lower-precision values. However, compression below 4-bits often distorts activation distributions and degrades performance. We address this challenge by introducing a sliced Wasserstein loss function for distribution-aware calibration in ultra-low-bit post-training quantization. The proposed loss aligns the output distributions of full-precision and quantized models under random linear projections, complementing standard mean-squared error loss without adding any computational overhead during inference. Our proposed loss function can be incorporated with any post-training quantization framework that has a retraining component. We demonstrate the performance gains of our proposed model by incorporating it with two frontier methods known as OmniQuant and TesseraQ. Compared to these two baselines, the proposed loss consistently improves both perplexity and downstream task accuracy across multiple ultra-low-bit settings. Our proposed loss function recovers 4.12-20.37% of the OmniQuant's lost accuracy on the language model LLaMA-2-7B, 0.93-7.65% on OPT-6.7B, and 2.26-6.20% on LLaMA-2-13B. TesseraQ's accuracy degradation is recovered by 3.63-7.63% in relative terms when augmented by our proposed loss function. Taken together, these results demonstrate that distributional alignment provides a simple yet effective performance boost that can push the limits of frontier quantization methods.

While ternary quantization offers a compelling solution by reducing weights to {-1, 0, +1}, current implementations suffer from a fundamental misalignment with commodity hardware. Most existing methods must choose between 2-bit aligned packing, which incurs significant bit wastage, or 1.67-bit irregular packing, which degrades inference speed. To resolve this tension, we propose Sherry, a hardware-efficient ternary quantization framework. Sherry introduces a 3:4 fine-grained sparsity that achieves a regularized 1.25-bit width by packing blocks of four weights into five bits, restoring power-of-two alignment. Furthermore, we identify weight trapping issue in sparse ternary training, which leads to representational collapse. To address this, Sherry introduces Arenas, an annealing residual synapse mechanism that maintains representational diversity during training. Empirical evaluations on LLaMA-3.2 across five benchmarks demonstrate that Sherry matches state-of-the-art ternary performance while significantly reducing model size. Notably, on an Intel i7-14700HX CPU, our 1B model achieves zero accuracy loss compared to SOTA baselines while providing 25% bit savings and 10% speed up.

Time series forecasting (TSF) is a key means to achieve this goal. In recent years, the large language models (LLMs) for TSF (LLM4TSF) have achieved good performance. However, there is a significant difference between pretraining corpora and time series data, making it hard to guarantee forecasting quality when directly applying LLMs to TSF; fine-tuning LLMs can mitigate this issue, but often incurs substantial computational overhead. Thus, LLM4TSF faces a dual challenge of prediction performance and compute overhead. To address this, we aim to explore a method for improving the forecasting performance of LLM4TSF while freezing all LLM parameters to reduce computational overhead. Inspired by in-context learning (ICL), we propose LVICL. LVICL uses our vector-injected ICL to inject example information into a frozen LLM, eliciting its in-context learning ability and thereby enhancing its performance on the example-related task (i.e., TSF). Specifically, we first use the LLM together with a learnable context vector adapter to extract a context vector from multiple examples adaptively.

Traditional methods for functional group removal and replacement often rely on rule-based heuristics, which can be limited in their ability to generate diverse and novel chemical structures. Recently, transformer-based models have shown promise in improving the accuracy and efficiency of molecular transformations, but existing approaches typically focus on single-step modeling, lacking the guarantee of structural similarity. In this work, we seek to advance the state of the art by developing a novel two-stage transformer model for functional group removal and replacement. Unlike one-shot approaches that generate entire molecules in a single pass, our method generates the functional group to be removed and appended sequentially, ensuring strict substructure-level modifications. Using a matched molecular pairs (MMPs) dataset derived from ChEMBL, we trained an encoder-decoder transformer model with SMIRKS-based representations to capture transformation rules effectively. Extensive evaluations demonstrate our method's ability to generate chemically valid transformations, explore diverse chemical spaces, and maintain scalability across varying search sizes.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5Transformer\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u529f\u80fd\u57fa\u56e2\u7684\u79fb\u9664\u548c\u66ff\u6362\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u987a\u5e8f\u751f\u6210\u786e\u4fdd\u4e25\u683c\u7684\u5b50\u7ed3\u6784\u7ea7\u4fee\u6539", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c4\u5219\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u751f\u6210\u591a\u6837\u5316\u548c\u65b0\u9896\u5316\u5b66\u7ed3\u6784\u65b9\u9762\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u73b0\u6709Transformer\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u4e13\u6ce8\u4e8e\u5355\u6b65\u5efa\u6a21\u4e14\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7ed3\u6784\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u4fdd\u8bc1", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5Transformer\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u987a\u5e8f\u751f\u6210\u8981\u79fb\u9664\u548c\u6dfb\u52a0\u7684\u529f\u80fd\u57fa\u56e2\uff1b\u4f7f\u7528\u57fa\u4e8eChEMBL\u7684\u5339\u914d\u5206\u5b50\u5bf9\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u91c7\u7528SMIRKS\u8868\u793a\u8bad\u7ec3\u7f16\u7801\u5668-\u89e3\u7801\u5668Transformer", "result": "\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u751f\u6210\u5316\u5b66\u6709\u6548\u7684\u8f6c\u5316\uff0c\u63a2\u7d22\u591a\u6837\u5316\u7684\u5316\u5b66\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u641c\u7d22\u89c4\u6a21\u4e0b\u4fdd\u6301\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5Transformer\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u529f\u80fd\u57fa\u56e2\u66ff\u6362\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u5355\u6b65Transformer\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u4e86\u7ed3\u6784\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u5e76\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf"}}

However, adapting LLMs to specialized fields such as medicine presents two challenge: (1) the \"Stability-Plasticity Dilemma\", where the model must acquire complex clinical knowledge without suffering from catastrophic forgetting of general world knowledge; and (2) \"Task Interference\", where disparate sub-tasks, such as medical diagnosis, report summarization, and drug-drug interaction prediction, compete for limited low-rank parameter space. In this paper, we propose Med-MoE-LoRA, a novel framework that integrates Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to enable efficient multi-task domain adaptation, especially for medical scenarios. Drawing inspiration from recent advances, our framework employs an asymmetric expert distribution where deeper layers are equipped with a higher density of LoRA experts to capture complex semantic abstractions. We further introduce a \"Knowledge-Preservation Plugin\", inspired by LoRA MoE, to isolate and protect general-purpose reasoning. By utilizing soft merging with adaptive routing and rank-wise decoupling, Med-MoE-LoRA achieves superior performance in medical benchmarks while reducing interference.

However, classical approaches such as variational autoencoders (VAEs) often struggle to preserve the higher-order statistical structure of fluid flows when subjected to strong compression. We propose DiffCoder, a coupled framework that integrates a probabilistic diffusion model with a conventional convolutional ResNet encoder and trains both components end-to-end. The encoder compresses the flow field into a latent representation, while the diffusion model learns a generative prior over reconstructions conditioned on the compressed state. This design allows DiffCoder to recover distributional and spectral properties that are not strictly required for minimizing pointwise reconstruction loss but are critical for faithfully representing statistical properties of the flow field. We evaluate DiffCoder and VAE baselines across multiple model sizes and compression ratios on a challenging dataset of Kolmogorov flow fields. Under aggressive compression, DiffCoder significantly improves the spectral accuracy while VAEs exhibit substantial degradation. Although both methods show comparable relative L2 reconstruction error, DiffCoder better preserves the underlying distributional structure of the flow. At moderate compression levels, sufficiently large VAEs remain competitive, suggesting that diffusion-based priors provide the greatest benefit when information bottlenecks are severe. These results demonstrate that the generative decoding by diffusion offers a promising path toward compact, statistically consistent representations of complex flow fields.", "AI": {"tldr": "DiffCoder\uff1a\u7ed3\u5408\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u5377\u79ef\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u7684\u6d41\u573a\u91cd\u5efa\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5728\u5f3a\u538b\u7f29\u4e0b\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edfVAE\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u4fdd\u6301\u6d41\u573a\u7684\u7edf\u8ba1\u7279\u6027", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u53d8\u5206\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff08VAE\uff09\u5728\u5f3a\u538b\u7f29\u4e0b\u96be\u4ee5\u4fdd\u6301\u6d41\u4f53\u6d41\u52a8\u7684\u9ad8\u9636\u7edf\u8ba1\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u66f4\u597d\u4fdd\u7559\u6d41\u573a\u7edf\u8ba1\u7279\u6027\u7684\u538b\u7f29\u91cd\u5efa\u65b9\u6cd5", "method": "\u63d0\u51faDiffCoder\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u6982\u7387\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u5377\u79efResNet\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u8026\u5408\uff0c\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u538b\u7f29\u6d41\u573a\u4e3a\u6f5c\u5728\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5b66\u4e60\u57fa\u4e8e\u538b\u7f29\u72b6\u6001\u7684\u751f\u6210\u5148\u9a8c", "result": "\u5728Kolmogorov\u6d41\u573a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u5f3a\u538b\u7f29\u4e0bDiffCoder\u663e\u8457\u6539\u5584\u8c31\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u800cVAE\u4e25\u91cd\u9000\u5316\uff1b\u4e24\u8005L2\u91cd\u5efa\u8bef\u5dee\u76f8\u5f53\uff0c\u4f46DiffCoder\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u6d41\u573a\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u7ed3\u6784", "conclusion": "\u6269\u6563\u751f\u6210\u89e3\u7801\u4e3a\u590d\u6742\u6d41\u573a\u7684\u7d27\u51d1\u3001\u7edf\u8ba1\u4e00\u81f4\u8868\u793a\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u524d\u666f\u7684\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u5728\u4fe1\u606f\u74f6\u9888\u4e25\u91cd\u65f6\u6269\u6563\u5148\u9a8c\u63d0\u4f9b\u6700\u5927\u4f18\u52bf"}}

In this study, we evaluate a range of reinforcement learning-based neighborhood selection strategies -- multi-armed bandits (upper confidence bound, $\u03b5$-greedy) and deep reinforcement learning methods (proximal policy optimization, double deep $Q$-network) -- and compare them against multiple baselines across three different problems: the traveling salesman problem, the pickup and delivery problem with time windows, and the car sequencing problem. We show how search-specific characteristics, particularly large variations in cost due to constraint violation penalties, necessitate carefully designed reward functions to provide stable and informative learning signals. Our extensive experiments reveal that algorithm performance varies substantially across problems, although that $\u03b5$-greedy consistently ranks among the best performers. In contrast, the computational overhead of deep reinforcement learning approaches only makes them competitive with a substantially longer runtime.

Temperature data represents a complex superposition of deterministic cyclical climate forces and stochastic, short-term fluctuations. While planetary mechanics drive predictable seasonal periodicities, rapid meteorological changes such as thermal variations, pressure anomalies, and humidity shifts introduce nonlinear volatilities that defy simple extrapolation. Historically, the Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (SARIMA) model has been the standard for modeling historical weather data, prized for capturing linear seasonal trends. However, SARIMA operates under strict assumptions of stationarity, failing to capture abrupt, nonlinear transitions. This leads to systematic residual errors, manifesting as the under-prediction of sudden spikes or the over-smoothing of declines. Conversely, Deep Learning paradigms, specifically Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, demonstrate exceptional efficacy in handling intricate time-series data. By utilizing memory gates, LSTMs learn complex nonlinear dependencies. Yet, LSTMs face instability in open-loop forecasting; without ground truth feedback, minor deviations compound recursively, causing divergence. To resolve these limitations, we propose a Hybrid SARIMA-LSTM architecture. This framework employs a residual-learning strategy to decompose temperature into a predictable climate component and a nonlinear weather component. The SARIMA unit models the robust, long-term seasonal trend, while the LSTM is trained exclusively on the residuals the nonlinear errors SARIMA fails to capture. By fusing statistical stability with neural plasticity, this hybrid approach minimizes error propagation and enhances long-horizon accuracy.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u6df7\u5408SARIMA-LSTM\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6b8b\u5dee\u5b66\u4e60\u7b56\u7565\u5c06\u6e29\u5ea6\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u53ef\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u6c14\u5019\u6210\u5206\u548c\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u5929\u6c14\u6210\u5206\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u7edf\u8ba1\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u795e\u7ecf\u53ef\u5851\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u957f\u671f\u6e29\u5ea6\u9884\u6d4b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u51c6\u786e\u9884\u6d4b\u957f\u671f\u5927\u6c14\u53d8\u91cf\u662f\u6c14\u8c61\u79d1\u5b66\u7684\u6838\u5fc3\u6311\u6218\u3002\u6e29\u5ea6\u6570\u636e\u5305\u542b\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u5468\u671f\u6c14\u5019\u529b\u548c\u968f\u673a\u77ed\u671f\u6ce2\u52a8\uff0c\u4f20\u7edfSARIMA\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u6355\u6349\u7ebf\u6027\u5b63\u8282\u8d8b\u52bf\u4f46\u65e0\u6cd5\u5904\u7406\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u7a81\u53d8\uff0c\u800cLSTM\u80fd\u5904\u7406\u590d\u6742\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u4f9d\u8d56\u4f46\u5728\u5f00\u73af\u9884\u6d4b\u4e2d\u6613\u53d1\u6563\u3002\u9700\u8981\u7ed3\u5408\u4e24\u8005\u4f18\u52bf\u89e3\u51b3\u5404\u81ea\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u6df7\u5408SARIMA-LSTM\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u6b8b\u5dee\u5b66\u4e60\u7b56\u7565\uff1aSARIMA\u5355\u5143\u5efa\u6a21\u7a33\u5065\u7684\u957f\u671f\u5b63\u8282\u8d8b\u52bf\uff0cLSTM\u4e13\u95e8\u8bad\u7ec3SARIMA\u65e0\u6cd5\u6355\u6349\u7684\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u6b8b\u5dee\u8bef\u5dee\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u878d\u5408\u7edf\u8ba1\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u795e\u7ecf\u53ef\u5851\u6027\uff0c\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u8bef\u5dee\u4f20\u64ad\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u89e3\u6e29\u5ea6\u4e3a\u53ef\u9884\u6d4b\u6c14\u5019\u6210\u5206\u548c\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u5929\u6c14\u6210\u5206\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408SARIMA\u7684\u7edf\u8ba1\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548cLSTM\u7684\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u5efa\u6a21\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u957f\u671f\u6e29\u5ea6\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u8bef\u5dee\u4f20\u64ad\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6df7\u5408SARIMA-LSTM\u67b6\u6784\u6709\u6548\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u7edf\u8ba1\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u5efa\u6a21\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6b8b\u5dee\u5b66\u4e60\u7b56\u7565\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u5404\u81ea\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u957f\u671f\u5927\u6c14\u53d8\u91cf\u9884\u6d4b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

However, conventional estimated time of arrival (ETA) models are primarily designed for the immediate next port of call and rely heavily on real-time automatic identification system (AIS) data, which is inherently unavailable for future voyage segments. To address this gap, the study reformulates future-port ETA prediction as a segment-level time-series forecasting problem. We develop a transformer-based architecture that integrates historical sailing durations, destination port congestion proxies, and static vessel descriptors. The proposed framework employs a causally masked attention mechanism to capture long-range temporal dependencies and a multi-task learning head to jointly predict segment sailing durations and port congestion states, leveraging shared latent signals to mitigate high uncertainty. Evaluation on a real-world global dataset from 2021 demonstrates the proposed model consistently outperforms a comprehensive suite of competitive baselines. The result shows a relative reduction of 4.85% in mean absolute error (MAE) and 4.95% in mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) compared with sequence baseline models. The relative reductions with gradient boosting machines are 9.39% in MAE and 52.97% in MAPE.

However, GNNs rely on two key operations - aggregation and update, which can pose challenges for low-latency inference tasks or resource-constrained scenarios. Simple Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) offer a computationally efficient alternative. Yet, training an MLP in a supervised setting often leads to suboptimal performance. Knowledge Distillation (KD) from a GNN teacher to an MLP student has emerged to bridge this gap. However, most KD methods either transfer knowledge uniformly across all nodes or rely on graph-agnostic indicators such as prediction uncertainty. We argue this overlooks a more fundamental, graph-centric inquiry: \"How important is a node to the structure of the graph?\" We introduce a framework, InfGraND, an Influence-guided Graph KNowledge Distillation from GNN to MLP that addresses this by identifying and prioritizing structurally influential nodes to guide the distillation process, ensuring that the MLP learns from the most critical parts of the graph. Additionally, InfGraND embeds structural awareness in MLPs through one-time multi-hop neighborhood feature pre-computation, which enriches the student MLP's input and thus avoids inference-time overhead. Our rigorous evaluation in transductive and inductive settings across seven homophilic graph benchmark datasets shows InfGraND consistently outperforms prior GNN to MLP KD methods, demonstrating its practicality for numerous latency-critical applications in real-world settings.", "AI": {"tldr": "InfGraND\uff1a\u4e00\u79cd\u5f71\u54cd\u529b\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u56fe\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4eceGNN\u5230MLP\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8bc6\u522b\u7ed3\u6784\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u8282\u70b9\u6307\u5bfc\u84b8\u998f\uff0c\u5e76\u5728MLP\u4e2d\u5d4c\u5165\u7ed3\u6784\u611f\u77e5\u80fd\u529b", "motivation": "GNN\u4f9d\u8d56\u805a\u5408\u548c\u66f4\u65b0\u64cd\u4f5c\uff0c\u5728\u4f4e\u5ef6\u8fdf\u63a8\u7406\u6216\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u9762\u4e34\u6311\u6218\u3002MLP\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u9ad8\u4f46\u6027\u80fd\u8f83\u5dee\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u65b9\u6cd5\u8981\u4e48\u5747\u5300\u4f20\u8f93\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u8981\u4e48\u4f9d\u8d56\u56fe\u65e0\u5173\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u8282\u70b9\u5bf9\u56fe\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u8fd9\u4e00\u6838\u5fc3\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faInfGraND\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1\uff09\u8bc6\u522b\u5e76\u4f18\u5148\u5904\u7406\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0a\u6709\u5f71\u54cd\u529b\u7684\u8282\u70b9\u6765\u6307\u5bfc\u84b8\u998f\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff1b2\uff09\u901a\u8fc7\u4e00\u6b21\u6027\u591a\u8df3\u90bb\u57df\u7279\u5f81\u9884\u8ba1\u7b97\u5728MLP\u4e2d\u5d4c\u5165\u7ed3\u6784\u611f\u77e5\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u5f00\u9500\u3002", "result": "\u57287\u4e2a\u540c\u914d\u6027\u56fe\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u8f6c\u5bfc\u548c\u5f52\u7eb3\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e2d\uff0cInfGraND\u59cb\u7ec8\u4f18\u4e8e\u5148\u524d\u7684GNN\u5230MLP\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u5ef6\u8fdf\u5173\u952e\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "InfGraND\u901a\u8fc7\u5173\u6ce8\u8282\u70b9\u5bf9\u56fe\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u4eceGNN\u5230MLP\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u4e3a\u4f4e\u5ef6\u8fdf\u56fe\u5206\u6790\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

To address this challenge, we construct structure-preserving metrics that are geodesically complete while ensuring that every stationary point under the new metric remains stationary under the original one. Building on this foundation, we revisit the classical symmetric two-point zeroth-order estimator and analyze its mean-squared error from a purely intrinsic perspective, depending only on the manifold's geometry rather than any ambient embedding. Leveraging this intrinsic analysis, we establish convergence guarantees for stochastic gradient descent with this intrinsic estimator. Under additional suitable conditions, an $\u03b5$-stationary point under the constructed metric $g'$ also corresponds to an $\u03b5$-stationary point under the original metric $g$, thereby matching the best-known complexity in the geodesically complete setting.

Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) offer a compact alternative to Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) by placing learnable univariate spline functions on edges rather than fixed activations on nodes, achieving competitive accuracy with fewer parameters. However, runtime B-spline evaluation introduces significant computational overhead unsuitable for latency-critical IoT applications. We propose a lookup table (LUT) compilation pipeline that replaces expensive spline computations with precomputed quantized tables and linear interpolation, dramatically reducing inference latency while preserving detection quality. Our lightweight KAN model (50K parameters, 0.19~MB) achieves 99.0\\% accuracy on the CICIDS2017 DoS dataset. After LUT compilation with resolution $L=8$, the model maintains 98.96\\% accuracy (F1 degradation $<0.0004$) while achieving $\\mathbf{68\\times}$ speedup at batch size 256 and over $\\mathbf{5000\\times}$ speedup at batch size 1, with only $2\\times$ memory overhead. We provide comprehensive evaluation across LUT resolutions, quantization schemes, and out-of-bounds policies, establishing clear Pareto frontiers for accuracy-latency-memory trade-offs.

Existing defenses either embed safety recovery into fine-tuning or rely on fine-tuning-derived priors for post-hoc correction, leaving safety recovery tightly coupled with training and incurring high computational overhead and a complex workflow. To address these challenges, we propose \\texttt{Q-realign}, a post-hoc defense method based on post-training quantization, guided by an analysis of representational structure. By reframing quantization as a dual-objective procedure for compression and safety, \\texttt{Q-realign} decouples safety alignment from fine-tuning and naturally piggybacks into modern deployment pipelines. Experiments across multiple models and datasets demonstrate that our method substantially reduces unsafe behaviors while preserving task performance, with significant reductions in memory usage and GPU hours. Notably, our approach can recover the safety alignment of a fine-tuned 7B LLM on a single RTX 4090 within 40 minutes.

Local representations are formed per channel by concatenating differential entropy with graph-theoretic features, while global representations summarize time-domain, spectral, and complexity characteristics at the trial level. These representations are fused in a dual-branch transformer with attention-based fusion and domain-adversarial regularization, with samples filtered by an intensity threshold.

Existing goal-conditioned and hierarchical offline RL methods decompose such tasks and generate intermediate rewards to mitigate limitations of traditional offline RL, but usually overlook temporal dependencies among subgoals and rely on imprecise reward shaping, leading to suboptimal policies. To address these issues, we propose STO-RL (Offline RL using LLM-Guided Subgoal Temporal Order), an offline RL framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) to generate temporally ordered subgoal sequences and corresponding state-to-subgoal-stage mappings. Using this temporal structure, STO-RL applies potential-based reward shaping to transform sparse terminal rewards into dense, temporally consistent signals, promoting subgoal progress while avoiding suboptimal solutions. The resulting augmented dataset with shaped rewards enables efficient offline training of high-performing policies. Evaluations on four discrete and continuous sparse-reward benchmarks demonstrate that STO-RL consistently outperforms state-of-the-art offline goal-conditioned and hierarchical RL baselines, achieving faster convergence, higher success rates, and shorter trajectories.

Models of cyclone intensification fill this data gap by simulating huge ensembles of synthetic hurricanes based on estimates of the storm's large scale environment. Both physics-based and statistical/ML intensification models have been developed to tackle this problem, but an open question is: can a physically reasonable and simple physics-style differential equation model of intensification be learned from data? In this paper, we answer this question in the affirmative by presenting a 10-term cubic stochastic differential equation model of Tropical Cyclone intensification. The model depends on a well-vetted suite of engineered environmental features known to drive intensification and is trained using a high quality dataset of hurricane intensity (IBTrACS) with estimates of the cyclone's large scale environment from a data-assimilated simulation (ERA5 reanalysis), restricted to the Northern Hemisphere. The model generates synthetic intensity series which capture many aspects of historical intensification statistics and hazard estimates in the Northern Hemisphere.

Traditional approaches--independent training and multi-task learning--struggle with either excessive computational costs or negative transfer. A recently proposed multi-policy approach, Model-Based Transfer Learning (MBTL), has demonstrated effectiveness by strategically selecting a few tasks to train and zero-shot transfer. However, CMDPs encompass a wide range of problems, exhibiting structural properties that vary from problem to problem. As such, different task selection strategies are suitable for different CMDPs. In this work, we introduce Structure Detection MBTL (SD-MBTL), a generic framework that dynamically identifies the underlying generalization structure of CMDP and selects an appropriate MBTL algorithm. For instance, we observe Mountain structure in which generalization performance degrades from the training performance of the target task as the context difference increases. We thus propose M/GP-MBTL, which detects the structure and adaptively switches between a Gaussian Process-based approach and a clustering-based approach. Extensive experiments on synthetic data and CRL benchmarks--covering continuous control, traffic control, and agricultural management--show that M/GP-MBTL surpasses the strongest prior method by 12.49% on the aggregated metric.

Ratios and rates are common examples. In gradient boosted trees, this combination is not an explicit operation: the model must synthesize it through coordinated splits on the component features. We study whether intra-tree column subsampling in XGBoost makes that synthesis harder. We use two synthetic data generating processes with cancellation-style structure. In both, two primitive features share a strong nuisance factor, while the target depends on a smaller differential factor. A log ratio cancels the nuisance and isolates the signal. We vary colsample_bylevel and colsample_bynode over s in {0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 0.9}, emphasizing mild subsampling (s >= 0.8). A control feature set includes the engineered ratio, removing the need for synthesis. Across both processes, intra-tree column subsampling reduces test PR-AUC in the primitives-only setting.

Despite its success, DL models often exhibit limited interpretability and generalization, which can undermine trust, especially in safety-critical deployments. As a result, there is growing interest in (i) analyzing interpretability and generalization and (ii) developing models that perform robustly under data distributions different from those seen during training (i.e. domain generalization). However, the theoretical analysis of DL remains incomplete. For example, many generalization analyses assume independent samples, which is violated in sequential data with temporal correlations. Motivated by these limitations, this paper proposes a method to analyze interpretability and out-of-domain (OOD) generalization for a family of recurrent neural networks (RNNs). Specifically, the evolution of a trained RNN's states is modeled as an unknown, discrete-time, nonlinear closed-loop feedback system. Using Koopman operator theory, these nonlinear dynamics are approximated with a linear operator, enabling interpretability. Spectral analysis is then used to quantify the worst-case impact of domain shifts on the generalization error. Building on this analysis, a domain generalization method is proposed that reduces the OOD generalization error and improves the robustness to distribution shifts. Finally, the proposed analysis and domain generalization approach are validated on practical temporal pattern-learning tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8eKoopman\u7b97\u5b50\u7406\u8bba\u7684RNN\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u548c\u57df\u5916\u6cdb\u5316\u5206\u6790\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u76f8\u5e94\u7684\u57df\u6cdb\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u5206\u5e03\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u5e8f\u5217\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u65f6\u95f4\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u8fdd\u53cd\u72ec\u7acb\u6837\u672c\u5047\u8bbe\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u4e0d\u5b8c\u6574\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u65b0\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u5206\u6790RNN\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u548c\u57df\u5916\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u8bad\u7ec3\u597d\u7684RNN\u72b6\u6001\u6f14\u5316\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u672a\u77e5\u7684\u79bb\u6563\u65f6\u95f4\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u95ed\u73af\u53cd\u9988\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528Koopman\u7b97\u5b50\u7406\u8bba\u8fd1\u4f3c\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u52a8\u6001\u4e3a\u7ebf\u6027\u7b97\u5b50\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u901a\u8fc7\u8c31\u5206\u6790\u91cf\u5316\u57df\u504f\u79fb\u5bf9\u6cdb\u5316\u8bef\u5dee\u7684\u6700\u574f\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5e76\u57fa\u4e8e\u6b64\u63d0\u51fa\u57df\u6cdb\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u5206\u6790\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u91cf\u5316RNN\u7684\u57df\u5916\u6cdb\u5316\u8bef\u5dee\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u7684\u57df\u6cdb\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u51cf\u5c11OOD\u6cdb\u5316\u8bef\u5dee\u5e76\u63d0\u9ad8\u5bf9\u5206\u5e03\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u65f6\u95f4\u6a21\u5f0f\u5b66\u4e60\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5f97\u5230\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u4e3aRNN\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u5e8f\u5217\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u548c\u57df\u6cdb\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u5b9e\u8df5\u4e0a\u90fd\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u5b89\u5168\u5173\u952e\u90e8\u7f72\u4e2d\u63d0\u9ad8\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u4fe1\u5ea6\u3002"}}

A fundamental difficulty in online RL is the lack of direct samples from the target distribution; instead, the target is an unnormalized Boltzmann distribution defined by the Q-function. To address this, two seemingly distinct families of methods have been proposed for diffusion policies: a noise-expectation family, which utilizes a weighted average of noise as the training target, and a gradient-expectation family, which employs a weighted average of Q-function gradients. Yet, it remains unclear how these objectives relate formally or if they can be synthesized into a more general formulation. In this paper, we propose a unified framework, reverse flow matching (RFM), which rigorously addresses the problem of training diffusion and flow models without direct target samples. By adopting a reverse inferential perspective, we formulate the training target as a posterior mean estimation problem given an intermediate noisy sample. Crucially, we introduce Langevin Stein operators to construct zero-mean control variates, deriving a general class of estimators that effectively reduce importance sampling variance. We show that existing noise-expectation and gradient-expectation methods are two specific instances within this broader class. This unified view yields two key advancements: it extends the capability of targeting Boltzmann distributions from diffusion to flow policies, and enables the principled combination of Q-value and Q-gradient information to derive an optimal, minimum-variance estimator, thereby improving training efficiency and stability. We instantiate RFM to train a flow policy in online RL, and demonstrate improved performance on continuous-control benchmarks compared to diffusion policy baselines.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6RFM\uff0c\u5c06\u6269\u6563\u7b56\u7565\u548c\u6d41\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u7edf\u4e00\u8d77\u6765\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53cd\u5411\u63a8\u65ad\u89c6\u89d2\u548cLangevin Stein\u7b97\u5b50\u51cf\u5c11\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u91c7\u6837\u65b9\u5dee\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u5728\u7ebf\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u6269\u6563\u548c\u6d41\u7b56\u7565\u5728\u5728\u7ebf\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\u5f3a\u4f46\u8bad\u7ec3\u56f0\u96be\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u566a\u58f0\u671f\u671b\u548c\u68af\u5ea6\u671f\u671b\uff09\u5173\u7cfb\u4e0d\u660e\u786e\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u6709\u6548\u8bad\u7ec3\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u53cd\u5411\u6d41\u5339\u914d\uff08RFM\uff09\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u53cd\u5411\u63a8\u65ad\u89c6\u89d2\uff0c\u5c06\u8bad\u7ec3\u76ee\u6807\u6784\u5efa\u4e3a\u540e\u9a8c\u5747\u503c\u4f30\u8ba1\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5f15\u5165Langevin Stein\u7b97\u5b50\u6784\u9020\u96f6\u5747\u503c\u63a7\u5236\u53d8\u91cf\uff0c\u63a8\u5bfc\u51fa\u80fd\u51cf\u5c11\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u91c7\u6837\u65b9\u5dee\u7684\u901a\u7528\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\u7c7b\u3002", "result": "RFM\u7edf\u4e00\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u566a\u58f0\u671f\u671b\u548c\u68af\u5ea6\u671f\u671b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u73bb\u5c14\u5179\u66fc\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u76ee\u6807\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408Q\u503c\u548cQ\u68af\u5ea6\u4fe1\u606f\u5f97\u5230\u6700\u4f18\u6700\u5c0f\u65b9\u5dee\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\uff0c\u5728\u8fde\u7eed\u63a7\u5236\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u7b56\u7565\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002", "conclusion": "RFM\u4e3a\u8bad\u7ec3\u6269\u6563\u548c\u6d41\u7b56\u7565\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u51cf\u5c11\u65b9\u5dee\u3001\u63d0\u5347\u8bad\u7ec3\u6548\u7387\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u5728\u7ebf\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u4f18\u5316\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

However, traditional static graph construction methods based on Euclidean distance often fail to capture the intrinsic curvature characteristics of the data manifold. Although Ollivier-Ricci Curvature Flow (OCF) has proven to be a powerful tool for dynamic topological optimization, its core reliance on Optimal Transport (Wasserstein distance) leads to prohibitive computational complexity, severely limiting its application in large-scale datasets and deep learning frameworks. To break this bottleneck, this paper proposes a novel geometric evolution framework: Resistance Curvature Flow (RCF). Leveraging the concept of effective resistance from circuit physics, RCF transforms expensive curvature optimization into efficient matrix operations. This approach achieves over 100x computational acceleration while maintaining geometric optimization capabilities comparable to OCF. We provide an in-depth exploration of the theoretical foundations and dynamical principles of RCF, elucidating how it guides the redistribution of edge weights via curvature gradients to eliminate topological noise and strengthen local cluster structures.

In this work, we propose {VBO-MI} (Variational Bayesian Optimization with Mutual Information), a fully gradient-based BO framework that leverages recent advances in variational mutual information estimation. To enable end-to-end gradient flow, we employ an actor-critic architecture consisting of an {action-net} to navigate the input space and a {variational critic} to estimate information gain. This formulation effectively eliminates the traditional inner-loop acquisition optimization bottleneck, achieving up to a {$10^2 \\times$ reduction in FLOPs} compared to BNN-BO baselines. We evaluate our method on a diverse suite of benchmarks, including high-dimensional synthetic functions and complex real-world tasks such as PDE optimization, the Lunar Lander control problem, and categorical Pest Control.

We run a set of probing experiments that test for the presence of linear regression coefficients, intermediate values from complex expressions, and the final answer in early layers. These experiments allow us to reason about the computations the model performs internally. Our results provide evidence that meaningful and structured information is stored inside the representations of tabular foundational models. We observe clear signals that correspond to both intermediate and final quantities involved in the model's prediction process.

However, existing MARL approaches often rely on frequent exchanges of action or state information among agents to achieve effective coordination, which is difficult to satisfy in practical robotic systems. A common solution is to introduce estimator networks to model the behaviors of other agents and predict their actions; nevertheless, such designs cause the size and computational cost of the estimator networks to grow rapidly with the number of agents, thereby limiting scalability in large-scale systems.\n  To address these challenges, this paper proposes a multiagent learning framework augmented with a Collective Influence Estimation Network (CIEN). By explicitly modeling the collective influence of other agents on the task object, each agent can infer critical interaction information solely from its local observations and the task object's states, enabling efficient collaboration without explicit action information exchange. The proposed framework effectively avoids network expansion as the team size increases; moreover, new agents can be incorporated without modifying the network structures of existing agents, demonstrating strong scalability. Experimental results on multiagent cooperative tasks based on the Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) algorithm show that the proposed method achieves stable and efficient coordination under communication-limited environments. Furthermore, policies trained with collective influence modeling are deployed on a real robotic platform, where experimental results indicate significantly improved robustness and deployment feasibility, along with reduced dependence on communication infrastructure.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faCIEN\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5efa\u6a21\u5176\u4ed6\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5bf9\u4efb\u52a1\u5bf9\u8c61\u7684\u96c6\u4f53\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u65e0\u9700\u663e\u5f0f\u52a8\u4f5c\u4fe1\u606f\u4ea4\u6362\u7684\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u534f\u4f5c\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u548c\u901a\u4fe1\u53d7\u9650\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709MARL\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u9891\u7e41\u7684\u52a8\u4f5c\u6216\u72b6\u6001\u4fe1\u606f\u4ea4\u6362\uff0c\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u96be\u4ee5\u6ee1\u8db3\uff1b\u73b0\u6709\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\u7f51\u7edc\u968f\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6570\u91cf\u589e\u52a0\u800c\u5feb\u901f\u81a8\u80c0\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u96c6\u4f53\u5f71\u54cd\u4f30\u8ba1\u7f51\u7edc(CIEN)\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u663e\u5f0f\u5efa\u6a21\u5176\u4ed6\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5bf9\u4efb\u52a1\u5bf9\u8c61\u7684\u96c6\u4f53\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u4f7f\u6bcf\u4e2a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u4ec5\u9700\u672c\u5730\u89c2\u6d4b\u548c\u4efb\u52a1\u5bf9\u8c61\u72b6\u6001\u5c31\u80fd\u63a8\u65ad\u5173\u952e\u4ea4\u4e92\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u663e\u5f0f\u52a8\u4f5c\u4fe1\u606f\u4ea4\u6362\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u57fa\u4e8eSAC\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u534f\u4f5c\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u901a\u4fe1\u53d7\u9650\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u7a33\u5b9a\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u534f\u8c03\uff1b\u7f51\u7edc\u89c4\u6a21\u4e0d\u968f\u56e2\u961f\u89c4\u6a21\u6269\u5927\u800c\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u65b0\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u52a0\u5165\u65e0\u9700\u4fee\u6539\u73b0\u6709\u7f51\u7edc\u7ed3\u6784\uff1b\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5e73\u53f0\u4e0a\u90e8\u7f72\u663e\u793a\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u90e8\u7f72\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "CIEN\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u96c6\u4f53\u5f71\u54cd\u5efa\u6a21\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86MARL\u4e2d\u7684\u901a\u4fe1\u4f9d\u8d56\u548c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u901a\u4fe1\u53d7\u9650\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u534f\u4f5c\uff0c\u5e76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u90e8\u7f72\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

This paper asks whether iterative communication is necessary for distributed linear regression. We show it is not. We formulate federated ridge regression as a distributed equilibrium problem where each client computes local sufficient statistics -- the Gram matrix and moment vector -- and transmits them once. The server reconstructs the global solution through a single matrix inversion. We prove exact recovery: under a coverage condition on client feature matrices, one-shot aggregation yields the centralized ridge solution, not an approximation. For heterogeneous distributions violating coverage, we derive non-asymptotic error bounds depending on spectral properties of the aggregated Gram matrix. Communication reduces from $\\mathcal{O}(Rd)$ in iterative methods to $\\mathcal{O}(d^2)$ total; for high-dimensional settings, we propose and experimentally validate random projection techniques reducing this to $\\mathcal{O}(m^2)$ where $m \\ll d$. We establish differential privacy guarantees where noise is injected once per client, eliminating the composition penalty that degrades privacy in multi-round protocols. We further address practical considerations including client dropout robustness, federated cross-validation for hyperparameter selection, and comparison with gradient-based alternatives. Comprehensive experiments on synthetic heterogeneous regression demonstrate that one-shot fusion matches FedAvg accuracy while requiring up to $38\\times$ less communication. The framework applies to kernel methods and random feature models but not to general nonlinear architectures.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7528\u4e8e\u8054\u90a6\u5cad\u56de\u5f52\u7684\u5355\u6b21\u901a\u4fe1\u534f\u8bae\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u8ba1\u7b97\u5e76\u4f20\u8f93\u5c40\u90e8\u5145\u5206\u7edf\u8ba1\u91cf\uff08Gram\u77e9\u9635\u548c\u77e9\u5411\u91cf\uff09\uff0c\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u901a\u8fc7\u5355\u6b21\u77e9\u9635\u6c42\u9006\u91cd\u6784\u5168\u5c40\u89e3\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u591a\u6b21\u8fed\u4ee3\u901a\u4fe1\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u534f\u8bae\u9700\u8981\u5728\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u548c\u4e2d\u592e\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u4e4b\u95f4\u8fdb\u884c\u91cd\u590d\u540c\u6b65\uff0c\u6536\u655b\u901f\u5ea6\u53d7\u5b66\u4e60\u7387\u3001\u6570\u636e\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u548c\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u91c7\u6837\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u672c\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u7ebf\u6027\u56de\u5f52\u662f\u5426\u771f\u7684\u9700\u8981\u8fed\u4ee3\u901a\u4fe1\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u901a\u4fe1\u5f00\u9500\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u8054\u90a6\u5cad\u56de\u5f52\u8868\u8ff0\u4e3a\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u5747\u8861\u95ee\u9898\uff1a\u6bcf\u4e2a\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u8ba1\u7b97\u5c40\u90e8\u5145\u5206\u7edf\u8ba1\u91cf\uff08Gram\u77e9\u9635\u548c\u77e9\u5411\u91cf\uff09\u5e76\u4e00\u6b21\u6027\u4f20\u8f93\u7ed9\u670d\u52a1\u5668\uff1b\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u901a\u8fc7\u5355\u6b21\u77e9\u9635\u6c42\u9006\u91cd\u6784\u5168\u5c40\u89e3\u3002\u5bf9\u4e8e\u9ad8\u7ef4\u8bbe\u7f6e\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u968f\u673a\u6295\u5f71\u6280\u672f\u5c06\u901a\u4fe1\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u4eceO(d\u00b2)\u964d\u4f4e\u5230O(m\u00b2)\uff0c\u5176\u4e2dm\u226ad\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u7279\u5f81\u77e9\u9635\u6ee1\u8db3\u8986\u76d6\u6761\u4ef6\u65f6\uff0c\u5355\u6b21\u805a\u5408\u80fd\u7cbe\u786e\u6062\u590d\u96c6\u4e2d\u5f0f\u5cad\u89e3\uff08\u800c\u975e\u8fd1\u4f3c\u89e3\uff09\u3002\u5bf9\u4e8e\u8fdd\u53cd\u8986\u76d6\u6761\u4ef6\u7684\u5f02\u8d28\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u63a8\u5bfc\u4e86\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u805a\u5408Gram\u77e9\u9635\u8c31\u6027\u8d28\u7684\u975e\u6e10\u8fd1\u8bef\u5dee\u754c\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u5355\u6b21\u878d\u5408\u5339\u914dFedAvg\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u51cf\u5c11\u9ad8\u8fbe38\u500d\u7684\u901a\u4fe1\u91cf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u7ebf\u6027\u56de\u5f52\u4e0d\u9700\u8981\u8fed\u4ee3\u901a\u4fe1\uff0c\u5355\u6b21\u901a\u4fe1\u534f\u8bae\u5728\u4fdd\u8bc1\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u5927\u5e45\u964d\u4f4e\u901a\u4fe1\u5f00\u9500\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u6838\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u968f\u673a\u7279\u5f81\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4f46\u4e0d\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u4e00\u822c\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u67b6\u6784\u3002\u8fd8\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5dee\u5206\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u8bc1\u3001\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u6389\u7ebf\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u8054\u90a6\u4ea4\u53c9\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7b49\u5b9e\u7528\u8003\u8651\u3002"}}

To address this, graph structure learning aims to infer a more optimal topology. Existing methods, however, often incur high computational costs due to complex generative models and iterative joint optimization, limiting their practical utility. In this paper, we propose GADPN, a simple yet effective graph structure learning framework that adaptively refines graph topology via low-rank denoising and generalized structural perturbation. Our approach makes two key contributions: (1) we introduce Bayesian optimization to adaptively determine the optimal denoising strength, tailoring the process to each graph's homophily level; and (2) we extend the structural perturbation method to arbitrary graphs via Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), overcoming its original limitation to symmetric structures. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that GADPN achieves state-of-the-art performance while significantly improving efficiency. It shows particularly strong gains on challenging disassortative graphs, validating its ability to robustly learn enhanced graph structures across diverse network types.", "AI": {"tldr": "GADPN\uff1a\u901a\u8fc7\u4f4e\u79e9\u53bb\u566a\u548c\u5e7f\u4e49\u7ed3\u6784\u6270\u52a8\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u4f18\u5316\u56fe\u62d3\u6251\u7684\u56fe\u7ed3\u6784\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5728\u6548\u7387\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u4e0a\u5747\u6709\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u56fe\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u6027\u80fd\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u89c2\u6d4b\u56fe\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\uff08\u566a\u58f0\u3001\u7f3a\u5931\u94fe\u63a5\u3001\u7ed3\u6784\u5c5e\u6027\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\uff09\uff0c\u800c\u73b0\u6709\u56fe\u7ed3\u6784\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528", "method": "\u63d0\u51faGADPN\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1\uff09\u4f7f\u7528\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u4f18\u5316\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u786e\u5b9a\u6700\u4f73\u53bb\u566a\u5f3a\u5ea6\uff0c\u6839\u636e\u56fe\u7684\u540c\u8d28\u6027\u6c34\u5e73\u5b9a\u5236\u5316\u5904\u7406\uff1b2\uff09\u901a\u8fc7\u5947\u5f02\u503c\u5206\u89e3\u5c06\u7ed3\u6784\u6270\u52a8\u65b9\u6cd5\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u4efb\u610f\u56fe\uff0c\u514b\u670d\u539f\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ec5\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5bf9\u79f0\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u9650\u5236", "result": "\u5728\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fbe\u5230\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u5728\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\u7684\u5f02\u914d\u56fe\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u5c24\u4e3a\u7a81\u51fa", "conclusion": "GADPN\u80fd\u591f\u8de8\u4e0d\u540c\u7f51\u7edc\u7c7b\u578b\u7a33\u5065\u5730\u5b66\u4e60\u589e\u5f3a\u7684\u56fe\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u4e3a\u56fe\u7ed3\u6784\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7b80\u5355\u800c\u6709\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848"}}

Recently, the hyperbolic space has been widely adopted in many studies to effectively learn these complex structures. Although these methods have demonstrated the advantages of the hyperbolic space in learning heterogeneous graphs, most existing methods still have several challenges. They rely heavily on tangent-space operations, which often lead to mapping distortions during frequent transitions. Moreover, their message-passing architectures mainly focus on local neighborhood information, making it difficult to capture global hierarchical structures and long-range dependencies between different types of nodes. To address these limitations, we propose Hyperbolic Heterogeneous Graph Transformer (HypHGT), which effectively and efficiently learns heterogeneous graph representations entirely within the hyperbolic space. Unlike previous message-passing based hyperbolic heterogeneous GNNs, HypHGT naturally captures both local and global dependencies through transformer-based architecture. Furthermore, the proposed relation-specific hyperbolic attention mechanism in HypHGT, which operates with linear time complexity, enables efficient computation while preserving the heterogeneous information across different relation types. This design allows HypHGT to effectively capture the complex structural properties and semantic information inherent in heterogeneous graphs. We conduct comprehensive experiments to evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of HypHGT, and the results demonstrate that it consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in node classification task, with significantly reduced training time and memory usage.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86Hyperbolic Heterogeneous Graph Transformer (HypHGT)\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u5b8c\u5168\u5728\u53cc\u66f2\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e60\u5f02\u6784\u56fe\u8868\u793a\u7684Transformer\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u5207\u7a7a\u95f4\u64cd\u4f5c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6620\u5c04\u5931\u771f\u3001\u4ee5\u53ca\u6d88\u606f\u4f20\u9012\u67b6\u6784\u96be\u4ee5\u6355\u83b7\u5168\u5c40\u5c42\u6b21\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u957f\u7a0b\u4f9d\u8d56\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u53cc\u66f2\u7a7a\u95f4\u5f02\u6784\u56fe\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u4e3b\u8981\u95ee\u9898\uff1a1) \u4e25\u91cd\u4f9d\u8d56\u5207\u7a7a\u95f4\u64cd\u4f5c\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u9891\u7e41\u8f6c\u6362\u65f6\u4ea7\u751f\u6620\u5c04\u5931\u771f\uff1b2) \u6d88\u606f\u4f20\u9012\u67b6\u6784\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u5c40\u90e8\u90bb\u57df\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u6355\u83b7\u5168\u5c40\u5c42\u6b21\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u4e0d\u540c\u7c7b\u578b\u8282\u70b9\u95f4\u7684\u957f\u7a0b\u4f9d\u8d56\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faHypHGT\uff0c\u5b8c\u5168\u5728\u53cc\u66f2\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u64cd\u4f5c\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u57fa\u4e8eTransformer\u7684\u67b6\u6784\u81ea\u7136\u6355\u83b7\u5c40\u90e8\u548c\u5168\u5c40\u4f9d\u8d56\u3002\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u5173\u7cfb\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u53cc\u66f2\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u7ebf\u6027\u65f6\u95f4\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\uff0c\u80fd\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u4e0d\u540c\u7c7b\u578b\u5173\u7cfb\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u8ba1\u7b97\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u8282\u70b9\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\uff0cHypHGT consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u95f4\u548c\u5185\u5b58\u4f7f\u7528\u3002", "conclusion": "HypHGT\u901a\u8fc7\u5b8c\u5168\u5728\u53cc\u66f2\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u64cd\u4f5c\u7684Transformer\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u6355\u83b7\u5f02\u6784\u56fe\u7684\u590d\u6742\u7ed3\u6784\u7279\u6027\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u5728\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u6548\u7387\u4e0a\u90fd\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u3002"}}

The Wishart distribution, $S=W_0W_0^\\top\\sim\\mathcal{W}_m(n,\u03c3^2 \\boldsymbol{I}_m)$, used for computing the output marginal variance is derived in closed form using expectations of zonal polynomials via James' theorem and a Laplace-integral expansion of $(\u03b1\\boldsymbol{I}_m+S)^{-1}$. We develop an Isserlis/Wick-based combinatorial expansion for $\\operatorname{\\mathbb{E}}\\left[\\operatorname{tr}(S^k)\\right]$ and provide explicit truncated moments up to $k=10$, which yield accurate series approximations for small-to-moderate $\u03c3^2$. Monte Carlo experiments confirm the theoretical estimates. Furthermore, empirical analysis was performed to quantify that, using current He or Kaiming initialization with scaling $1/\\sqrt{n}$, the output variance is $0.41$, whereas the new parameterization with $10/ \\sqrt{n}$ for $\u03b1=1$ results in an output variance of $0.9$. The findings clarify why deep $\\mathcal{L}$-Lipschitz networks suffer rapid information loss at initialization and offer practical prescriptions for choosing initialization hyperparameters to mitigate this effect. However, using the Higgs boson classification dataset, a hyperparameter sweep over optimizers, initialization scale, and depth was conducted to validate the results on real-world data, showing that although the derivation ensures variance preservation, empirical results indicate He initialization still performs better.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5206\u6790LDLT-based Lipschitz\u5c42\u7684\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u52a8\u6001\uff0c\u63a8\u5bfc\u9ad8\u65af\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u4e0b\u7684\u8f93\u51fa\u65b9\u5dee\u95ed\u5f0f\u89e3\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5f53\u524d\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bfc\u81f4\u4fe1\u606f\u635f\u5931\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u65b0\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u4f46\u5b9e\u8bc1\u663e\u793aHe\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u4ecd\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u597d\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u6df1\u5ea6Lipschitz\u7f51\u7edc\u5728\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u65f6\u4fe1\u606f\u5feb\u901f\u635f\u5931\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u5f53\u524d\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u5982He/Kaiming\u521d\u59cb\u5316\uff09\u5728Lipschitz\u5c42\u4e2d\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u5bfb\u6c42\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528Wishart\u5206\u5e03\u7406\u8bba\u63a8\u5bfc\u8f93\u51fa\u65b9\u5dee\u7684\u95ed\u5f0f\u89e3\uff1a1) \u5229\u7528James\u5b9a\u7406\u548czonal\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u671f\u671b\uff1b2) \u4f7f\u7528Laplace\u79ef\u5206\u5c55\u5f00(\u03b1I+S)^{-1}\uff1b3) \u5f00\u53d1\u57fa\u4e8eIsserlis/Wick\u7684\u7ec4\u5408\u5c55\u5f00\u8ba1\u7b97E[tr(S^k)]\uff1b4) \u63d0\u4f9bk=10\u4ee5\u5185\u7684\u663e\u5f0f\u622a\u65ad\u77e9\uff1b5) \u8fdb\u884c\u8499\u7279\u5361\u6d1b\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff1b6) \u5728Higgs\u73bb\u8272\u5b50\u5206\u7c7b\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u626b\u63cf\u3002", "result": "1) \u5f53\u524dHe/Kaiming\u521d\u59cb\u5316\uff08\u7f29\u653e1/\u221an\uff09\u8f93\u51fa\u65b9\u5dee\u4e3a0.41\uff1b2) \u65b0\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u65b9\u6848\uff08\u7f29\u653e10/\u221an\uff0c\u03b1=1\uff09\u8f93\u51fa\u65b9\u5dee\u63d0\u5347\u81f30.9\uff1b3) \u7406\u8bba\u63a8\u5bfc\u786e\u4fdd\u65b9\u5dee\u4fdd\u6301\uff0c\u4f46\u5b9e\u8bc1\u663e\u793aHe\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u4ecd\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u597d\uff1b4) \u8499\u7279\u5361\u6d1b\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5b9e\u7406\u8bba\u4f30\u8ba1\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9610\u660e\u4e86\u6df1\u5ea6Lipschitz\u7f51\u7edc\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u65f6\u4fe1\u606f\u635f\u5931\u7684\u539f\u56e0\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9009\u62e9\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u5efa\u8bae\uff0c\u4f46\u53d1\u73b0\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\u7684\u65b9\u5dee\u4fdd\u6301\u5e76\u4e0d\u4e00\u5b9a\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u6027\u80fd\uff0cHe\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u5728\u5b9e\u8bc1\u4e2d\u4ecd\u66f4\u4f18\u3002"}}

Most existing studies evaluate the performance of methods using the single-label dataset that can be instantiated by selecting a label from multi-label data while maintaining the original features. Because the chosen label can vary arbitrarily depending on the experimental setting, the superiority among compared methods can be changed with regard to which label happens to be selected. Thus, evaluating unsupervised feature selection methods based solely on single-label accuracy is unreasonable for assessing their true discriminative ability. This study revisits this evaluation paradigm by adopting a multi-label classification framework. Experiments on 21 multi-label datasets using several representative methods demonstrate that performance rankings differ markedly from those reported under single-label settings, suggesting the possibility of multi-label evaluation settings for fair and reliable comparison of unsupervised feature selection methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u91cd\u65b0\u5ba1\u89c6\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u7279\u5f81\u9009\u62e9\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4f7f\u7528\u591a\u6807\u7b7e\u5206\u7c7b\u6846\u67b6\u4ee3\u66ff\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u5355\u6807\u7b7e\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u4ee5\u66f4\u516c\u5e73\u53ef\u9760\u5730\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e0d\u540c\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u5224\u522b\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u7279\u5f81\u9009\u62e9\u65b9\u6cd5\u5927\u591a\u4f7f\u7528\u5355\u6807\u7b7e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8fdb\u884c\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u4f46\u5355\u6807\u7b7e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u901a\u5e38\u662f\u4ece\u591a\u6807\u7b7e\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u968f\u673a\u9009\u62e9\u4e00\u4e2a\u6807\u7b7e\u6784\u5efa\u7684\u3002\u7531\u4e8e\u9009\u62e9\u7684\u6807\u7b7e\u53ef\u80fd\u56e0\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bbe\u7f6e\u800c\u5f02\uff0c\u4e0d\u540c\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u4f18\u52a3\u6392\u540d\u4f1a\u968f\u7740\u6240\u9009\u6807\u7b7e\u7684\u53d8\u5316\u800c\u6539\u53d8\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u4ec5\u57fa\u4e8e\u5355\u6807\u7b7e\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u8bc4\u4f30\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u7279\u5f81\u9009\u62e9\u65b9\u6cd5\u662f\u4e0d\u5408\u7406\u7684\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u591a\u6807\u7b7e\u5206\u7c7b\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u8bc4\u4f30\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u7279\u5f81\u9009\u62e9\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u572821\u4e2a\u591a\u6807\u7b7e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u4f7f\u7528\u51e0\u79cd\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u65b9\u6cd5\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u5b83\u4eec\u5728\u591a\u6807\u7b7e\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u6392\u540d\u4e0e\u5355\u6807\u7b7e\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u6807\u7b7e\u8bc4\u4f30\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\uff0c\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u7279\u5f81\u9009\u62e9\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u6392\u540d\u4e0e\u5355\u6807\u7b7e\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u62a5\u544a\u7684\u6392\u540d\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u8fd9\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u591a\u6807\u7b7e\u8bc4\u4f30\u8bbe\u7f6e\u5bf9\u4e8e\u516c\u5e73\u53ef\u9760\u6bd4\u8f83\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u7279\u5f81\u9009\u62e9\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5fc5\u8981\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u5355\u6807\u7b7e\u8bc4\u4f30\u8303\u5f0f\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u591a\u6807\u7b7e\u8bc4\u4f30\u8bbe\u7f6e\u80fd\u591f\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u516c\u5e73\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u6bd4\u8f83\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u5efa\u8bae\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u91c7\u7528\u591a\u6807\u7b7e\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u8bc4\u4f30\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u7279\u5f81\u9009\u62e9\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u5224\u522b\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

These patterns play a key role in passing information across tokens. But why do they emerge? In this paper, we demystify the emergence of these Slash-Dominant Heads (SDHs) from both empirical and theoretical perspectives. First, by analyzing open-source LLMs, we find that SDHs are intrinsic to models and generalize to out-of-distribution prompts. To explain the intrinsic emergence, we analyze the queries, keys, and Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE), which jointly determine attention scores. Our empirical analysis reveals two characteristic conditions of SDHs: (1) Queries and keys are almost rank-one, and (2) RoPE is dominated by medium- and high-frequency components. Under these conditions, queries and keys are nearly identical across tokens, and interactions between medium- and high-frequency components of RoPE give rise to SDHs.

To address this, prior work explores various strategies to infer an appropriate reasoning budget from the input. However, such approaches are unreliable in the worst case, as estimating the minimal required reasoning effort is fundamentally difficult, and they implicitly fix the trade-off between reasoning cost and accuracy during training, limiting flexibility under varying deployment scenarios. Motivated by these limitations, we propose ORBIT, a controllable multi-budget reasoning framework with well-separated reasoning modes triggered by input. ORBIT employs multi-stage reinforcement learning to discover Pareto-optimal reasoning behaviors at each effort, followed by on-policy distillation to fuse these behaviors into a single unified model. Experiments show that ORBIT achieves (1) controllable reasoning behavior over multiple modes, (2) competitive reasoning density within each mode, and (3) integration of these frontier policies into a single unified student model while preserving clear mode separation and high per-mode performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "ORBIT\uff1a\u4e00\u4e2a\u53ef\u63a7\u7684\u591a\u9884\u7b97\u63a8\u7406\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u53d1\u73b0\u5e15\u7d2f\u6258\u6700\u4f18\u63a8\u7406\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u5e76\u84b8\u998f\u5230\u5355\u4e00\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u6309\u9700\u63a8\u7406\u6210\u672c\u63a7\u5236", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5927\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u4f7f\u7528\u8fc7\u957f\u7684\u94fe\u5f0f\u63a8\u7406\u5bfc\u81f4\u4e0d\u5fc5\u8981\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u800c\u73b0\u6709\u9884\u7b97\u63a8\u65ad\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0d\u53ef\u9760\u4e14\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7075\u6d3b\u6027", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u591a\u9636\u6bb5\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u53d1\u73b0\u4e0d\u540c\u52aa\u529b\u7a0b\u5ea6\u4e0b\u7684\u5e15\u7d2f\u6258\u6700\u4f18\u63a8\u7406\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u7ebf\u7b56\u7565\u84b8\u998f\u5c06\u8fd9\u4e9b\u884c\u4e3a\u878d\u5408\u5230\u5355\u4e00\u7edf\u4e00\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d", "result": "ORBIT\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86(1)\u591a\u6a21\u5f0f\u53ef\u63a7\u63a8\u7406\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c(2)\u5404\u6a21\u5f0f\u4e0b\u7ade\u4e89\u6027\u63a8\u7406\u5bc6\u5ea6\uff0c(3)\u5c06\u524d\u6cbf\u7b56\u7565\u96c6\u6210\u5230\u5355\u4e00\u5b66\u751f\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u6e05\u6670\u7684\u6a21\u5f0f\u5206\u79bb\u548c\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd", "conclusion": "ORBIT\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u53ef\u63a7\u591a\u9884\u7b97\u63a8\u7406\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u63a8\u7406\u6210\u672c\u4e0e\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6743\u8861\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u4e0d\u540c\u90e8\u7f72\u573a\u666f\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7075\u6d3b\u6027"}}

In this study, epoch-wise double descent, which is delayed generalization following overfitting, was empirically investigated by focusing on the evolution of internal structures. Fully connected neural networks of three different sizes were trained on the CIFAR-10 dataset with 30% label noise. By decomposing the loss curves into signal contributions from clean and noisy training data, the epoch-wise evolutions of internal signals were analyzed separately. Three main findings were obtained from this analysis. First, the model achieved strong re-generalization on test data even after perfectly fitting noisy training data during the double descent phase, corresponding to a \"benign overfitting\" state. Second, noisy data were learned after clean data, and as learning progressed, their corresponding internal activations became increasingly separated in outer layers; this enabled the model to overfit only noisy data. Third, a single, very large activation emerged in the shallow layer across all models; this phenomenon is referred as \"outliers,\" \"massive activa-tions,\" and \"super activations\" in recent large language models and evolves with re-generalization. The magnitude of large activation correlated with input patterns but not with output patterns.

However, their effectiveness in addressing radiomics-specific challenges remains unclear. This study evaluates the performance, efficiency, and accessibility of general-purpose and radiomics-specific AutoML frameworks on diverse radiomics classification tasks, thereby highlighting development needs for radiomics. Ten public/private radiomics datasets with varied imaging modalities (CT/MRI), sizes, anatomies and endpoints were used. Six general-purpose and five radiomics-specific frameworks were tested with predefined parameters using standardized cross-validation. Evaluation metrics included AUC, runtime, together with qualitative aspects related to software status, accessibility, and interpretability. Simplatab, a radiomics-specific tool with a no-code interface, achieved the highest average test AUC (81.81%) with a moderate runtime (~1 hour). LightAutoML, a general-purpose framework, showed the fastest execution with competitive performance (78.74% mean AUC in six minutes). Most radiomics-specific frameworks were excluded from the performance analysis due to obsolescence, extensive programming requirements, or computational inefficiency. Conversely, general-purpose frameworks demonstrated higher accessibility and ease of implementation.

This makes monitoring crucial to understand and quantify the impact of the ship radiated noise. Passive Acoustic Monitoring (PAM) systems are widely deployed for this purpose, generating years of underwater recordings across diverse soundscapes. Manual analysis of such large-scale data is impractical, motivating the need for automated approaches based on machine learning. Recent advances in automatic Underwater Acoustic Target Recognition (UATR) have largely relied on supervised learning, which is constrained by the scarcity of labeled data. Transfer Learning (TL) offers a promising alternative to mitigate this limitation. In this work, we conduct the first empirical comparative study of transfer learning for UATR, evaluating multiple pretrained audio models originating from diverse audio domains. The pretrained model weights are frozen, and the resulting embeddings are analyzed through classification, clustering, and similarity-based evaluations. The analysis shows that the geometrical structure of the embedding space is largely dominated by recording-specific characteristics. However, a simple linear probe can effectively suppress this recording-specific information and isolate ship-type features from these embeddings. As a result, linear probing enables effective automatic UATR using pretrained audio models at low computational cost, significantly reducing the need for a large amounts of high-quality labeled ship recordings.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u9996\u6b21\u5bf9\u6c34\u4e0b\u58f0\u5b66\u76ee\u6807\u8bc6\u522b\u4e2d\u7684\u8fc1\u79fb\u5b66\u4e60\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u8bc1\u6bd4\u8f83\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u97f3\u9891\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5d4c\u5165\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e3b\u8981\u53d7\u5f55\u97f3\u7279\u5b9a\u7279\u5f81\u4e3b\u5bfc\uff0c\u4f46\u901a\u8fc7\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u7ebf\u6027\u63a2\u6d4b\u53ef\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u6291\u5236\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7279\u5f81\u5e76\u5206\u79bb\u51fa\u8239\u8236\u7c7b\u578b\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u4ee5\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u5b9e\u73b0\u6709\u6548\u7684\u6c34\u4e0b\u58f0\u5b66\u76ee\u6807\u8bc6\u522b\u3002", "motivation": "\u8239\u8236\u4ea7\u751f\u7684\u4eba\u4e3a\u566a\u58f0\u5bf9\u6d77\u6d0b\u751f\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u6784\u6210\u5a01\u80c1\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u76d1\u6d4b\u8239\u8236\u8f90\u5c04\u566a\u58f0\u3002\u88ab\u52a8\u58f0\u5b66\u76d1\u6d4b\u7cfb\u7edf\u4ea7\u751f\u5927\u91cf\u6c34\u4e0b\u5f55\u97f3\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u624b\u52a8\u5206\u6790\u4e0d\u5207\u5b9e\u9645\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u6c34\u4e0b\u58f0\u5b66\u76ee\u6807\u8bc6\u522b\u4e3b\u8981\u4f9d\u8d56\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u4f46\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u6807\u8bb0\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\uff0c\u8fc1\u79fb\u5b66\u4e60\u4e3a\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e00\u9650\u5236\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u524d\u666f\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u5bf9\u6c34\u4e0b\u58f0\u5b66\u76ee\u6807\u8bc6\u522b\u4e2d\u7684\u8fc1\u79fb\u5b66\u4e60\u8fdb\u884c\u9996\u6b21\u5b9e\u8bc1\u6bd4\u8f83\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u6765\u81ea\u4e0d\u540c\u97f3\u9891\u9886\u57df\u7684\u591a\u4e2a\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u97f3\u9891\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u51bb\u7ed3\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u6743\u91cd\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u7c7b\u3001\u805a\u7c7b\u548c\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u5206\u6790\u751f\u6210\u7684\u5d4c\u5165\u7a7a\u95f4\u3002\u4f7f\u7528\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u7ebf\u6027\u63a2\u6d4b\u6765\u6291\u5236\u5f55\u97f3\u7279\u5b9a\u4fe1\u606f\u5e76\u5206\u79bb\u8239\u8236\u7c7b\u578b\u7279\u5f81\u3002", "result": "\u5206\u6790\u663e\u793a\u5d4c\u5165\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\u4e3b\u8981\u53d7\u5f55\u97f3\u7279\u5b9a\u7279\u5f81\u4e3b\u5bfc\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u7ebf\u6027\u63a2\u6d4b\u53ef\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u6291\u5236\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5f55\u97f3\u7279\u5b9a\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u5e76\u4ece\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5d4c\u5165\u4e2d\u5206\u79bb\u51fa\u8239\u8236\u7c7b\u578b\u7279\u5f81\u3002\u7ebf\u6027\u63a2\u6d4b\u80fd\u591f\u4ee5\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u4f7f\u7528\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u97f3\u9891\u6a21\u578b\u5b9e\u73b0\u6709\u6548\u7684\u6c34\u4e0b\u58f0\u5b66\u76ee\u6807\u8bc6\u522b\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u5bf9\u5927\u91cf\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u6807\u8bb0\u8239\u8236\u5f55\u97f3\u7684\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fc1\u79fb\u5b66\u4e60\u4e3a\u6c34\u4e0b\u58f0\u5b66\u76ee\u6807\u8bc6\u522b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ebf\u6027\u63a2\u6d4b\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u97f3\u9891\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5d4c\u5165\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u6807\u8bb0\u6570\u636e\u6709\u9650\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u8239\u8236\u7c7b\u578b\u8bc6\u522b\uff0c\u4e3a\u6d77\u6d0b\u566a\u58f0\u76d1\u6d4b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

Such mismatches are especially problematic in domain adaptation tasks, where only a few reference examples are available and retraining the diffusion model is infeasible. Existing inference-time guidance methods can adjust sampling trajectories, but they typically optimize surrogate objectives such as classifier likelihoods rather than directly aligning with the target distribution. We propose MMD Guidance, a training-free mechanism that augments the reverse diffusion process with gradients of the Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) between generated samples and a reference dataset. MMD provides reliable distributional estimates from limited data, exhibits low variance in practice, and is efficiently differentiable, which makes it particularly well-suited for the guidance task. Our framework naturally extends to prompt-aware adaptation in conditional generation models via product kernels. Also, it can be applied with computational efficiency in latent diffusion models (LDMs), since guidance is applied in the latent space of the LDM.

At the same time, many scientific applications can be viewed as the evolution of spatially distributed fields, making data-driven forecasting of such fields a core task in scientific machine learning. In this work we study autoregressive deep-learning surrogates for two-dimensional PDE dynamics on periodic domains, focusing on generalization to out-of-distribution initial conditions within a fixed PDE and parameter regime and on strict small-data settings with at most $\\mathcal{O}(10^2)$ simulated trajectories per system. We introduce a multi-channel U-Net [...], evaluate it on five qualitatively different PDE families and compare it to ViT, AFNO, PDE-Transformer, and KAN-UNet under a common training setup. Across all datasets, me-UNet matches or outperforms these more complex architectures in terms of field-space error, spectral similarity, and physics-based metrics for in-distribution rollouts, while requiring substantially less training time. It also generalizes qualitatively to unseen initial conditions with as few as $\\approx 20$ training simulations.

Each product must be accurately mapped to a node within a multi-level taxonomic hierarchy defined by national standards, where errors lead to financial inconsistencies and regulatory risks. This paper presents Taxon, a semantically aligned and expert-guided framework for hierarchical tax code prediction. Taxon integrates (i) a feature-gating mixture-of-experts architecture that adaptively routes multi-modal features across taxonomy levels, and (ii) a semantic consistency model distilled from large language models acting as domain experts to verify alignment between product titles and official tax definitions. To address noisy supervision in real business records, we design a multi-source training pipeline that combines curated tax databases, invoice validation logs, and merchant registration data to provide both structural and semantic supervision. Extensive experiments on the proprietary TaxCode dataset and public benchmarks demonstrate that Taxon achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming strong baselines. Further, an additional full hierarchical paths reconstruction procedure significantly improves structural consistency, yielding the highest overall F1 scores.

We provide a theoretical explanation for this phenomenon by analyzing how the sampling policy's coverage evolves throughout on-policy training. We propose and rigorously justify the \\emph{coverage improvement principle}: with sufficient batch size, each update moves into a region around the target where coverage is uniformly better, making subsequent data increasingly informative and enabling rapid convergence. In the contextual bandit setting with Bradley-Terry preferences and linear softmax policy class, we show that on-policy DPO converges exponentially in the number of iterations for batch size exceeding a generalized coverage threshold. In contrast, any learner restricted to offline samples from the initial policy suffers a slower minimax rate, leading to a sharp separation in total sample complexity. Motivated by this analysis, we further propose a simple hybrid sampler based on a novel \\emph{preferential} G-optimal design, which removes dependence on coverage and guarantees convergence in just two rounds. Finally, we develop principled on-policy schemes for reward distillation in the general function class setting, and show faster noiseless rates under an alternative deviation-based notion of coverage. Experimentally, we confirm that on-policy DPO and our proposed reward distillation algorithms outperform their off-policy counterparts and enjoy stable, monotonic performance gains across iterations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5728\u7ebf\u7b56\u7565\u504f\u597d\u5b66\u4e60\u7b97\u6cd5\uff08\u5982\u5728\u7ebfDPO\uff09\u4f18\u4e8e\u79bb\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u91c7\u6837\u7b56\u7565\u8986\u76d6\u5ea6\u6f14\u5316\u63d0\u4f9b\u7406\u8bba\u89e3\u91ca\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u8986\u76d6\u5ea6\u6539\u8fdb\u539f\u5219\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u5728\u7ebfDPO\u5728\u7ebf\u6027softmax\u7b56\u7565\u7c7b\u4e0b\u6307\u6570\u6536\u655b\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u4f18\u5148G\u6700\u4f18\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u91c7\u6837\u5668\uff0c\u5e76\u5f00\u53d1\u5956\u52b1\u84b8\u998f\u7684\u5728\u7ebf\u7b56\u7565\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u7ebf\u7b56\u7565\u504f\u597d\u5b66\u4e60\u7b97\u6cd5\uff08\u5982\u5728\u7ebfDPO\uff09\u5728\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u9f50\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u79bb\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7406\u8bba\u89e3\u91ca\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u4ece\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\u89e3\u91ca\u8fd9\u4e00\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u91c7\u6837\u7b56\u7565\u8986\u76d6\u5ea6\u5982\u4f55\u6f14\u5316\uff0c\u5e76\u57fa\u4e8e\u6b64\u63d0\u51fa\u6539\u8fdb\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "1\uff09\u63d0\u51fa\u8986\u76d6\u5ea6\u6539\u8fdb\u539f\u5219\uff1a\u5728\u7ebf\u66f4\u65b0\u4f7f\u91c7\u6837\u7b56\u7565\u8986\u76d6\u5ea6\u9010\u6b65\u6539\u5584\uff1b2\uff09\u5728Bradley-Terry\u504f\u597d\u548c\u7ebf\u6027softmax\u7b56\u7565\u7c7b\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u8d4c\u535a\u673a\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e2d\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u5728\u7ebfDPO\u6536\u655b\u6027\uff1b3\uff09\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u4f18\u5148G\u6700\u4f18\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u91c7\u6837\u5668\uff0c\u6d88\u9664\u5bf9\u8986\u76d6\u5ea6\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\uff1b4\uff09\u5f00\u53d1\u4e00\u822c\u51fd\u6570\u7c7b\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u7684\u5728\u7ebf\u7b56\u7565\u5956\u52b1\u84b8\u998f\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "result": "1\uff09\u8bc1\u660e\u5728\u7ebfDPO\u5728\u6279\u6b21\u5927\u5c0f\u8d85\u8fc7\u5e7f\u4e49\u8986\u76d6\u5ea6\u9608\u503c\u65f6\u6307\u6570\u6536\u655b\uff1b2\uff09\u79bb\u7ebf\u91c7\u6837\u65b9\u6cd5\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u8f83\u6162\u7684\u6781\u5c0f\u6781\u5927\u901f\u7387\uff1b3\uff09\u6df7\u5408\u91c7\u6837\u5668\u4ec5\u9700\u4e24\u8f6e\u5373\u53ef\u4fdd\u8bc1\u6536\u655b\uff1b4\uff09\u5728\u66ff\u4ee3\u7684\u504f\u5dee\u8986\u76d6\u5ea6\u6982\u5ff5\u4e0b\u83b7\u5f97\u66f4\u5feb\u7684\u65e0\u566a\u58f0\u901f\u7387\uff1b5\uff09\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5728\u7ebfDPO\u548c\u5956\u52b1\u84b8\u998f\u7b97\u6cd5\u4f18\u4e8e\u79bb\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u7a33\u5b9a\u5355\u8c03\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5728\u7ebf\u7b56\u7565\u504f\u597d\u5b66\u4e60\u901a\u8fc7\u8986\u76d6\u5ea6\u6539\u8fdb\u5b9e\u73b0\u6307\u6570\u6536\u655b\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u79bb\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u91c7\u6837\u5668\u548c\u5728\u7ebf\u5956\u52b1\u84b8\u998f\u65b9\u6848\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6536\u655b\u6548\u7387\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u9f50\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u6307\u5bfc\u548c\u5b9e\u7528\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002"}}

Existing methods for map matching are generally based on Hidden Markov Model (HMM) or encoder-decoder framework. However, these methods continue to face significant challenges when handling noisy or sparsely sampled GPS trajectories. To address these limitations, we propose DiffMM, an encoder-diffusion-based map matching framework that produces effective yet efficient matching results through a one-step diffusion process. We first introduce a road segment-aware trajectory encoder that jointly embeds the input trajectory and its surrounding candidate road segments into a shared latent space through an attention mechanism.

In mortality prediction, TFN yielded an AUC of 0.86. TFN outperformed unimodal baselines (approx 10% AUC improvement over time series only baseline, approx 5% AUC improvement over time series with static patient data). Integrating clinical text improved performance across all tasks.

These methods rely on group-relative advantage estimation to avoid learned critics, yet its theoretical properties remain poorly understood.\n  In this work, we uncover a fundamental issue of group-based RL: the group-relative advantage estimator is inherently biased relative to the true (expected) advantage. We provide the first theoretical analysis showing that it systematically underestimates advantages for hard prompts and overestimates them for easy prompts, leading to imbalanced exploration and exploitation. To address this issue, we propose History-Aware Adaptive Difficulty Weighting (HA-DW), an adaptive reweighting scheme that adjusts advantage estimates based on an evolving difficulty anchor and training dynamics. Both theoretical analysis and experiments on five mathematical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that HA-DW consistently improves performance when integrated into GRPO and its variants. Our results suggest that correcting biased advantage estimation is critical for robust and efficient RLVR training.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u5206\u7ec4\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e2d\u7ec4\u76f8\u5bf9\u4f18\u52bf\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\u5b58\u5728\u56fa\u6709\u504f\u5dee\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5386\u53f2\u611f\u77e5\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u96be\u5ea6\u52a0\u6743\u65b9\u6848\u6765\u7ea0\u6b63\u8fd9\u79cd\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u5728\u4e94\u4e2a\u6570\u5b66\u63a8\u7406\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "motivation": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u5206\u7ec4\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u5982GRPO\u53ca\u5176\u53d8\u4f53\uff09\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u88ab\u5e7f\u6cdb\u4f7f\u7528\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u6838\u5fc3\u7684\u7ec4\u76f8\u5bf9\u4f18\u52bf\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u7279\u6027\u5c1a\u672a\u88ab\u5145\u5206\u7406\u89e3\u3002\u4f5c\u8005\u53d1\u73b0\u8be5\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\u76f8\u5bf9\u4e8e\u771f\u5b9e\u4f18\u52bf\u5b58\u5728\u56fa\u6709\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u8fd9\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u63a2\u7d22\u4e0e\u5229\u7528\u7684\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u5386\u53f2\u611f\u77e5\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u96be\u5ea6\u52a0\u6743\uff08HA-DW\uff09\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u91cd\u52a0\u6743\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6839\u636e\u6f14\u5316\u96be\u5ea6\u951a\u70b9\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u4f18\u52bf\u4f30\u8ba1\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u7ea0\u6b63\u7ec4\u76f8\u5bf9\u4f18\u52bf\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\u7684\u504f\u5dee\u6765\u6539\u5584\u8bad\u7ec3\u6548\u679c\u3002", "result": "\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u548c\u5728\u4e94\u4e2a\u6570\u5b66\u63a8\u7406\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cHA-DW\u5728\u96c6\u6210\u5230GRPO\u53ca\u5176\u53d8\u4f53\u540e\u80fd\u6301\u7eed\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u8fd9\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u7ea0\u6b63\u504f\u5dee\u4f18\u52bf\u4f30\u8ba1\u5bf9\u4e8e\u9c81\u68d2\u9ad8\u6548\u7684RLVR\u8bad\u7ec3\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7ec4\u76f8\u5bf9\u4f18\u52bf\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\u5b58\u5728\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u504f\u5dee\uff08\u5bf9\u56f0\u96be\u63d0\u793a\u4f4e\u4f30\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u5bf9\u7b80\u5355\u63d0\u793a\u9ad8\u4f30\u4f18\u52bf\uff09\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u63a2\u7d22\u4e0e\u5229\u7528\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u3002HA-DW\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u91cd\u52a0\u6743\u6709\u6548\u7ea0\u6b63\u4e86\u8fd9\u4e00\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u4e3a\u57fa\u4e8e\u5206\u7ec4\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u7a33\u5065\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

In the first stage, a denoising autoencoder is trained to suppress artifacts and stabilize temporal dynamics, providing robust signal representations. In the second stage, a multitask architecture processes these denoised signals to achieve three objectives: motor imagery classification, chaotic versus non-chaotic regime discrimination using Lyapunov exponent-based labels, and self-supervised contrastive representation learning with NT-Xent loss. A convolutional backbone combined with a Transformer encoder captures spatial-temporal structure, while the dynamical task encourages sensitivity to nonlinear brain dynamics. This staged design mitigates interference between reconstruction and discriminative goals, improves stability across datasets, and supports reproducible training by clearly separating noise reduction from higher-level feature learning. Empirical studies show that our framework not only enhances robustness and generalization but also surpasses strong baselines and recent state-of-the-art methods in EEG decoding, highlighting the effectiveness of combining denoising, dynamical features, and self-supervised learning.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5206\u6790\u8111\u7535\u56fe\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u6574\u5408\u4e86\u53bb\u566a\u3001\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u5efa\u6a21\u548c\u8868\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u5728EEG\u89e3\u7801\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "EEG\u4fe1\u53f7\u901a\u5e38\u5305\u542b\u566a\u58f0\u548c\u4f2a\u5f71\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u540c\u65f6\u5904\u7406\u4fe1\u53f7\u53bb\u566a\u548c\u9ad8\u7ea7\u7279\u5f81\u5b66\u4e60\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u591f\u6574\u5408\u53bb\u566a\u3001\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u5efa\u6a21\u548c\u8868\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8EEG\u89e3\u7801\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff1a\u7b2c\u4e00\u9636\u6bb5\u4f7f\u7528\u53bb\u566a\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u6291\u5236\u4f2a\u5f71\u5e76\u7a33\u5b9a\u65f6\u95f4\u52a8\u6001\uff1b\u7b2c\u4e8c\u9636\u6bb5\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u67b6\u6784\u5904\u7406\u53bb\u566a\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e09\u4e2a\u76ee\u6807\uff1a\u8fd0\u52a8\u60f3\u8c61\u5206\u7c7b\u3001\u57fa\u4e8eLyapunov\u6307\u6570\u7684\u6df7\u6c8c\u4e0e\u975e\u6df7\u6c8c\u72b6\u6001\u5224\u522b\u3001\u4ee5\u53ca\u4f7f\u7528NT-Xent\u635f\u5931\u7684\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u5bf9\u6bd4\u8868\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\u3002\u91c7\u7528\u5377\u79ef\u4e3b\u5e72\u7f51\u7edc\u7ed3\u5408Transformer\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u6355\u83b7\u65f6\u7a7a\u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u4e0d\u4ec5\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u800c\u4e14\u5728EEG\u89e3\u7801\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e86\u5f3a\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u6700\u65b0\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u7ed3\u5408\u53bb\u566a\u3001\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7279\u5f81\u548c\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u660e\u786e\u5206\u79bb\u566a\u58f0\u51cf\u5c11\u548c\u9ad8\u7ea7\u7279\u5f81\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u6574\u5408\u4e86\u53bb\u566a\u3001\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u5efa\u6a21\u548c\u8868\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86EEG\u4fe1\u53f7\u5206\u6790\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u53ef\u91cd\u590d\u6027\u3002"}}

Based on the first algorithm, we propose our main algorithm, which utilizes entropy regularization. We investigate the finite-sample analysis of both algorithms and derive their regret bounds. We demonstrate that the inclusion of entropy regularization improves the regret and drastically controls the episode-to-episode variability that is inherent in OFU-based safe RL algorithms.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e24\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e50\u89c2\u9762\u5bf9\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027(OFU)\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u71b5\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u6539\u8fdb\u9057\u61be\u754c\u5e76\u63a7\u5236\u53d8\u5f02\u6027", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u51b3\u7b56\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u5e26\u5b89\u5168\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u7b56\u7565\u5b66\u4e60\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u5b66\u4e60\u9636\u6bb5\u4ee5\u9ad8\u6982\u7387\u6ee1\u8db3\u5b89\u5168\u7ea6\u675f", "method": "1. \u57fa\u4e8eOFU\u539f\u5219\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u7b97\u6cd5\uff1b2. \u5f15\u5165\u71b5\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u7b97\u6cd5\uff1b\u91c7\u7528\u53ef\u8fbe-\u907f\u514d(reach-avoid)\u6846\u67b6", "result": "\u5bf9\u4e24\u79cd\u7b97\u6cd5\u8fdb\u884c\u6709\u9650\u6837\u672c\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u63a8\u5bfc\u9057\u61be\u754c\uff1b\u71b5\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u6539\u5584\u4e86\u9057\u61be\u5e76\u663e\u8457\u63a7\u5236\u4e86OFU\u5b89\u5168RL\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u56de\u5408\u95f4\u53d8\u5f02\u6027", "conclusion": "\u71b5\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u662f\u63d0\u5347\u5b89\u5168\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7b97\u6cd5\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u6709\u6548\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u540c\u65f6\u6539\u5584\u9057\u61be\u754c\u5e76\u63a7\u5236\u53d8\u5f02\u6027"}}

This work introduces a soft partition--based Kernel-Adaptive Physics-Informed Extreme Learning Machine (KAPI-ELM), a deterministic low-dimensional parameterization in which smooth partition lengths jointly control collocation centers and Gaussian kernel widths, enabling continuous coarse-to-fine resolution without Fourier features, random sampling, or hard domain interfaces. A signed-distance-based weighting further stabilizes least-squares learning on irregular geometries. Across eight benchmarks--including oscillatory ODEs, high-frequency Poisson equations, irregular-shaped domains, and stiff singularly perturbed convection-diffusion problems-the proposed method matches or exceeds the accuracy of state-of-the-art Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) and Theory of Functional Connections (TFC) variants while using only a single linear solve. Although demonstrated on steady linear PDEs, the results show that soft-partition kernel adaptation provides a fast, architecture-free approach for multiscale PDEs with broad potential for future physics-informed modeling.

Although RL agents can converge to optimal solutions, the definition of ``optimality'' depends on the environment's statistical properties. The Bellman equation, central to most RL algorithms, is formulated in terms of expected values of future rewards. However, when ergodicity is broken, long-term outcomes depend on the specific trajectory rather than on the ensemble average. In such settings, the ensemble average diverges from the time-average growth experienced by individual agents, with expected-value formulations yielding systematically suboptimal policies. Prior studies demonstrated that traditional RL architectures fail to recover the true optimum in non-ergodic environments. We extend this analysis to deep RL implementations and show that these, too, produce suboptimal policies under non-ergodic dynamics. Introducing explicit time dependence into the learning process can correct this limitation. By allowing the network's function approximation to incorporate temporal information, the agent can estimate value functions consistent with the process's intrinsic growth rate. This improvement does not require altering the environmental feedback, such as reward transformations or modified objective functions, but arises naturally from the agent's exposure to temporal trajectories.

This is the authors manuscript version; final version available at IEEE Xplore: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11318441", "summary": "Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems have shown good success at classifying. However, the lack of explainability is a true and significant challenge, especially in high-stakes domains, such as health and finance, where understanding is paramount. We propose a new solution to this challenge: an explainable AI framework based on our comparative study with Quantum Boltzmann Machines (QBMs) and Classical Boltzmann Machines (CBMs). We leverage principles of quantum computing within classical machine learning to provide substantive transparency around decision-making. The design involves training both models on a binarised and dimensionally reduced MNIST dataset, where Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is applied for preprocessing. For interpretability, we employ gradient-based saliency maps in QBMs and SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) in CBMs to evaluate feature attributions.QBMs deploy hybrid quantum-classical circuits with strongly entangling layers, allowing for richer latent representations, whereas CBMs serve as a classical baseline that utilises contrastive divergence. Along the way, we found that QBMs outperformed CBMs on classification accuracy (83.5% vs. 54%) and had more concentrated distributions in feature attributions as quantified by entropy (1.27 vs. 1.39). In other words, QBMs not only produced better predictive performance than CBMs, but they also provided clearer identification of \"active ingredient\" or the most important features behind model predictions. To conclude, our results illustrate that quantum-classical hybrid models can display improvements in both accuracy and interpretability, which leads us toward more trustworthy and explainable AI systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u91cf\u5b50\u73bb\u5c14\u5179\u66fc\u673a\u5728\u5206\u7c7b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u7ecf\u5178\u73bb\u5c14\u5179\u66fc\u673a\uff0c\u4e3a\u6784\u5efa\u66f4\u53ef\u4fe1\u7684AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u9014\u5f84\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524dAI\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u533b\u7597\u548c\u91d1\u878d\u7b49\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u9886\u57df\uff0c\u7406\u89e3\u6a21\u578b\u51b3\u7b56\u8fc7\u7a0b\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u91cf\u5b50\u73bb\u5c14\u5179\u66fc\u673a\u548c\u7ecf\u5178\u73bb\u5c14\u5179\u66fc\u673a\u5bf9\u6bd4\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91caAI\u6846\u67b6\u3002\u4f7f\u7528PCA\u9884\u5904\u7406\u540e\u7684\u4e8c\u503c\u5316MNIST\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e24\u79cd\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u91cf\u5b50\u6a21\u578b\u91c7\u7528\u6df7\u5408\u91cf\u5b50-\u7ecf\u5178\u7535\u8def\u548c\u5f3a\u7ea0\u7f20\u5c42\uff0c\u7ecf\u5178\u6a21\u578b\u4f7f\u7528\u5bf9\u6bd4\u6563\u5ea6\u3002\u4f7f\u7528\u68af\u5ea6\u663e\u8457\u6027\u56fe\u548cSHAP\u65b9\u6cd5\u8bc4\u4f30\u7279\u5f81\u5f52\u56e0\u3002", "result": "\u91cf\u5b50\u73bb\u5c14\u5179\u66fc\u673a\u5728\u5206\u7c7b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u7ecf\u5178\u73bb\u5c14\u5179\u66fc\u673a\uff0883.5% vs. 54%\uff09\uff0c\u4e14\u7279\u5f81\u5f52\u56e0\u5206\u5e03\u66f4\u96c6\u4e2d\uff08\u71b5\u503c1.27 vs. 1.39\uff09\uff0c\u80fd\u66f4\u6e05\u6670\u5730\u8bc6\u522b\u9884\u6d4b\u4e2d\u7684\u5173\u952e\u7279\u5f81\u3002", "conclusion": "\u91cf\u5b50-\u7ecf\u5178\u6df7\u5408\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u5747\u6709\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u4e3a\u6784\u5efa\u66f4\u53ef\u4fe1\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u524d\u666f\u7684\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

We argue that this failure stems from regularizing local token behavior rather than diversity over sets of solutions. To address this, we propose Uniqueness-Aware Reinforcement Learning, a rollout-level objective that explicitly rewards correct solutions that exhibit rare high-level strategies. Our method uses an LLM-based judge to cluster rollouts for the same problem according to their high-level solution strategies, ignoring superficial variations, and reweights policy advantages inversely with cluster size. As a result, correct but novel strategies receive higher rewards than redundant ones.

We formalize an ideal notion of universal alignment through test-time scaling: for each prompt, the model produces $k\\ge 1$ candidate responses and a user selects their preferred one. We introduce $(k,f(k))$-robust alignment, which requires the $k$-output model to have win rate $f(k)$ against any other single-output model, and asymptotic universal alignment (U-alignment), which requires $f(k)\\to 1$ as $k\\to\\infty$. Our main result characterizes the optimal convergence rate: there exists a family of single-output policies whose $k$-sample product policies achieve U-alignment at rate $f(k)=\\frac{k}{k+1}$, and no method can achieve a faster rate in general.\n  We show that popular post-training methods, including Nash learning from human feedback (NLHF), can fundamentally underutilize the benefits of test-time scaling. Even though NLHF is optimal for $k=1$, sampling from the resulting (often deterministic) policy cannot guarantee win rates above $\\tfrac{1}{2}$ except for an arbitrarily small slack. This stems from a lack of output diversity: existing alignment methods can collapse to a single majority-preferred response, making additional samples redundant. In contrast, our approach preserves output diversity and achieves the optimal test-time scaling rate. In particular, we propose a family of symmetric multi-player alignment games and prove that any symmetric Nash equilibrium policy of the $(k+1)$-player alignment game achieves the optimal $(k,\\frac{k}{k+1})$-robust alignment. Finally, we provide theoretical convergence guarantees for self-play learning dynamics in these games and extend the framework to opponents that also generate multiple responses.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u901a\u8fc7\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u6269\u5c55\u5b9e\u73b0\u901a\u7528\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u6700\u4f18\u6536\u655b\u7387\u4e3ak/(k+1)\uff0c\u5e76\u6307\u51fa\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5982NLHF\u56e0\u7f3a\u4e4f\u8f93\u51fa\u591a\u6837\u6027\u800c\u65e0\u6cd5\u5145\u5206\u5229\u7528\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u9700\u8981\u670d\u52a1\u5177\u6709\u5f02\u8d28\u4e14\u53ef\u80fd\u51b2\u7a81\u504f\u597d\u7684\u7528\u6237\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u548c\u53ef\u4fe1AI\u7684\u6838\u5fc3\u6311\u6218\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u5bf9\u9f50\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u6269\u5c55\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u5145\u5206\u5229\u7528\u591a\u5019\u9009\u54cd\u5e94\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa(k,f(k))-\u9c81\u68d2\u5bf9\u9f50\u548c\u6e10\u8fd1\u901a\u7528\u5bf9\u9f50(U-alignment)\u7684\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff1b\u5f15\u5165\u5bf9\u79f0\u591a\u73a9\u5bb6\u5bf9\u9f50\u6e38\u620f\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u5bf9\u79f0\u7eb3\u4ec0\u5747\u8861\u7b56\u7565\u80fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u6700\u4f18\u5bf9\u9f50\uff1b\u63d0\u4f9b\u81ea\u535a\u5f08\u5b66\u4e60\u52a8\u6001\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u6536\u655b\u4fdd\u8bc1\u3002", "result": "\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u6700\u4f18\u6536\u655b\u7387\u4e3af(k)=k/(k+1)\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u5355\u8f93\u51fa\u7b56\u7565\u65cf\u80fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u8be5\u901f\u7387\uff0c\u4e14\u6ca1\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u83b7\u5f97\u66f4\u5feb\u7684\u6536\u655b\u7387\uff1b\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5982NLHF\u6700\u591a\u53ea\u80fd\u8fbe\u5230\u7565\u9ad8\u4e8e1/2\u7684\u80dc\u7387\uff0c\u800c\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u5bf9\u79f0\u591a\u73a9\u5bb6\u6e38\u620f\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u6700\u4f18\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u6269\u5c55\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u6269\u5c55\u548c\u4fdd\u6301\u8f93\u51fa\u591a\u6837\u6027\u662f\u5b9e\u73b0\u901a\u7528\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u5173\u952e\uff0c\u5bf9\u79f0\u591a\u73a9\u5bb6\u5bf9\u9f50\u6e38\u620f\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u6700\u4f18\u6536\u655b\u7387\uff0c\u4e3a\u4e2a\u6027\u5316AI\u5bf9\u9f50\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\u548c\u5b9e\u7528\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}
