Recent\ntrends show that the required energy for these datacenters will rise over time,\nor at least remain constant. Hence, the scientific community developed\ndifferent algorithms, architectures, and approaches for improving the energy\nefficiency of cloud datacenters, which are summarized under the umbrella term\nGreen Cloud computing. In this paper, we use an economic approach - taxes - for\nreducing the energy consumption of datacenters. We developed a tax model called\nGreenCloud tax, which penalizes energy-inefficient datacenters while fostering\ndatacenters that are energy-efficient. Hence, providers running\nenergy-efficient datacenters are able to offer cheaper prices to consumers,\nwhich consequently leads to a shift of workloads from energy-inefficient\ndatacenters to energy-efficient datacenters. The GreenCloud tax approach was\nimplemented using the simulation environment CloudSim. We applied real data\nsets published in the SPEC benchmark for the executed simulation scenarios,\nwhich we used for evaluating the GreenCloud tax."}

Since\nthe collapsed ETF of optimal policy DNNs maximally separates the pair-wise\nangles of all actions in the state-action space, we naturally raise a question:\ncan we learn an optimal policy using an ETF structure as a (fixed) target\nconfiguration in the action selection layer? Our analytical proof shows that\nlearning activations with a fixed ETF as action selection layer naturally leads\nto the AC. We thus propose the Action Collapse Policy Gradient (ACPG) method,\nwhich accordingly affixes a synthetic ETF as our action selection layer. ACPG\ninduces the policy DNN to produce such an ideal configuration in the action\nselection layer while remaining optimal. Our experiments across various OpenAI\nGym environments demonstrate that our technique can be integrated into any\ndiscrete PG methods and lead to favorable reward improvements more quickly and\nrobustly."}

RIS\ntypically comprises passive reflective antenna elements that control the\nwireless propagation environment by adequately tuning the phase of the\nreflective elements. The allocation of RIS elements to multipleuser equipment\n(UEs) is crucial for efficiently utilizing RIS.

Although it is\nrelatively easy to find inputs that cause a DL model to misbehave, the grouping\nof inputs by features that make the DL model under test fail is largely\nunexplored. Existing approaches for DL testing introduce perturbations that may\nfocus on specific failure-inducing features, while neglecting others that\nbelong to different regions of the feature space. In this paper, we create an\nexplicit topographical map of the input feature space. Our approach, named\nTopoMap, is both black-box and model-agnostic as it relies solely on features\nthat characterise the input space. To discriminate the inputs according to the\nspecific features they share, we first apply dimensionality reduction to obtain\ninput embeddings, which are then subjected to clustering. Each DL model might\nrequire specific embedding computations and clustering algorithms to achieve a\nmeaningful separation of inputs into discriminative groups. We propose a novel\nway to evaluate alternative configurations of embedding and clustering\ntechniques. We used a deep neural network (DNN) as an approximation of a human\nevaluator who could tell whether a pair of clusters can be discriminated based\non the features of the included elements. We use such a DNN to automatically\nselect the optimal topographical map of the inputs among all those that are\nproduced by different embedding/clustering configurations.

The generality of\nstructure transfer comes in part from its ability to ensure that the source\nrepresentation and the generated target representation satisfy \\textit{any}\nspecified relation (such as semantic equivalence).

Recently, data-driven approaches, particularly those based on\ngraph neural networks (GNNs), have shown progress in tackling such problems.\nHowever, these approaches are often limited to learning fluid behavior in\nstatic free-fall environments or simple manipulation settings involving\nprimitive objects, often overlooking complex interactions with dynamically\nmoving kinematic rigid bodies. Here, we propose a GNN-based framework designed\nfrom the ground up to learn the dynamics of liquids under rigid body\ninteractions and active manipulations, where particles are represented as graph\nnodes and particle-object collisions are handled using surface representations\nwith the bounding volume hierarchy (BVH) algorithm. This approach enables the\nnetwork to model complex interactions between liquid particles and intricate\nsurface geometries. Our model accurately captures fluid behavior in dynamic\nsettings and can also function as a simulator in static free-fall environments.\nDespite being trained on a single-object manipulation task of pouring, our\nmodel generalizes effectively to environments with unseen objects and novel\nmanipulation tasks such as stirring and scooping.

During training,\nconverting model weights and activations into low-precision formats, i.e.,\nquantization, can drastically reduce training times, energy consumption, and\ncost, and is thus a widely used technique. In this work, we demonstrate that\nquantization causes significantly higher accuracy degradation in DP-SGD\ncompared to regular SGD. We observe that this is caused by noise injection in\nDP-SGD, which amplifies quantization variance, leading to disproportionately\nlarge accuracy degradation. To address this challenge, we present QPQuant, a\ndynamic quantization framework that adaptively selects a changing subset of\nlayers to quantize at each epoch. Our method combines two key ideas that\neffectively reduce quantization variance: (i) probabilistic sampling of the\nlayers that rotates which layers are quantized every epoch, and (ii) loss-aware\nlayer prioritization, which uses a differentially private loss sensitivity\nestimator to identify layers that can be quantized with minimal impact on model\nquality. This estimator consumes a negligible fraction of the overall privacy\nbudget, preserving DP guarantees.

To control the policy entropy, a commonly used method is entropy\nregularization, which is adopted in various popular RL algorithms including\nPPO, SAC and A3C. Although entropy regularization proves effective in robotic\nand games RL conventionally, studies found that it gives weak to no gains in\nLLM-RL training. In this work, we study the issues of entropy bonus in LLM-RL\nsetting. Specifically, we first argue that the conventional entropy\nregularization suffers from the LLM's extremely large response space and the\nsparsity of the optimal outputs. As a remedy, we propose AEnt, an entropy\ncontrol method that utilizes a new clamped entropy bonus with an automatically\nadjusted coefficient. The clamped entropy is evaluated with the re-normalized\npolicy defined on certain smaller token space, which encourages exploration\nwithin a more compact response set. In addition, the algorithm automatically\nadjusts entropy coefficient according to the clamped entropy value, effectively\ncontrolling the entropy-induced bias while leveraging the entropy's benefits.\nAEnt is tested in math-reasoning tasks under different base models and\ndatasets, and it is observed that AEnt outperforms the baselines consistently\nacross multiple benchmarks."}

We construct CropGlobe, a\nglobal crop type dataset with 300,000 pixel-level samples from eight countries\nacross five continents, covering six major food and industrial crops (corn,\nsoybeans, rice, wheat, sugarcane, cotton). With broad geographic coverage,\nCropGlobe enables a systematic evaluation under cross-country, cross-continent,\nand cross-hemisphere transfer. We compare the transferability of temporal\nmulti-spectral features (Sentinel-2-based 1D/2D median features and harmonic\ncoefficients) and hyperspectral features (from EMIT). To improve generalization\nunder spectral and phenological shifts, we design CropNet, a lightweight and\nrobust CNN tailored for pixel-level crop classification, coupled with temporal\ndata augmentation (time shift, time scale, and magnitude warping) that\nsimulates realistic cross-regional phenology.
