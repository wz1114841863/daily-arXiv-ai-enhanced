### [1] [Hard Shell, Reliable Core: Improving Resilience in Replicated Systems with Selective Hybridization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10141)
*Laura Lawniczak,Tobias Distler*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: ShellFT框架通过微复制技术，灵活选择需要抵御拜占庭故障的复制逻辑部分，显著降低多样化成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有混合容错模型在灵活性和多样化开销上存在不足。

Method: 提出ShellFT框架，利用微复制技术，允许系统设计者自由选择需拜占庭容错的部分。

Result: 相比传统方法，ShellFT能减少70%以上的多样化成本。

Conclusion: ShellFT为特定用例提供了灵活且高效的混合容错解决方案。

Abstract: Hybrid fault models are known to be an effective means for enhancing the
robustness of consensus-based replicated systems. However, existing
hybridization approaches suffer from limited flexibility with regard to the
composition of crash-tolerant and Byzantine fault-tolerant system parts and/or
are associated with a significant diversification overhead. In this paper we
address these issues with ShellFT, a framework that leverages the concept of
micro replication to allow system designers to freely choose the parts of the
replication logic that need to be resilient against Byzantine faults. As a key
benefit, such a selective hybridization makes it possible to develop hybrid
solutions that are tailored to the specific characteristics and requirements of
individual use cases. To illustrate this flexibility, we present three custom
ShellFT protocols and analyze the complexity of their implementations. Our
evaluation shows that compared with traditional hybridization approaches,
ShellFT is able to decrease diversification costs by more than 70%.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 硬件多样性及GPU在低精度计算中的性能提升，促使科学HPC工作流采用混合精度算法和性能可移植模型。

Method: 使用Hipify框架实现性能可移植性，并通过动态混合精度框架优化FFTMatvec应用。性能优化直接集成到rocBLAS库中。

Result: FFTMatvec在AMD GPU上表现出色，并在OLCF Frontier超级计算机上扩展到2,048个GPU。

Conclusion: 提出的框架成功实现了性能可移植性和混合精度优化，为HPC应用提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: The hardware diversity displayed in leadership-class computing facilities,
alongside the immense performance boosts exhibited by today's GPUs when
computing in lower precision, provide a strong incentive for scientific HPC
workflows to adopt mixed-precision algorithms and performance portability
models. We present an on-the-fly framework using Hipify for performance
portability and apply it to FFTMatvec-an HPC application that computes
matrix-vector products with block-triangular Toeplitz matrices. Our approach
enables FFTMatvec, initially a CUDA-only application, to run seamlessly on AMD
GPUs with excellent observed performance. Performance optimizations for AMD
GPUs are integrated directly into the open-source rocBLAS library, keeping the
application code unchanged. We then present a dynamic mixed-precision framework
for FFTMatvec; a Pareto front analysis determines the optimal mixed-precision
configuration for a desired error tolerance. Results are shown for AMD Instinct
MI250X, MI300X, and the newly launched MI355X GPUs. The performance-portable,
mixed-precision FFTMatvec is scaled to 2,048 GPUs on the OLCF Frontier
supercomputer.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统压缩技术在处理不规则粒子分布和GPU架构限制时表现不佳，导致吞吐量有限和压缩比不理想。

Method: GPZ采用四阶段并行流水线，结合计算、内存访问和GPU占用率的优化，实现接近硬件极限的吞吐量。

Result: 在三种GPU架构和六个真实科学数据集上的评估显示，GPZ比五种先进GPU压缩器性能更优，吞吐量提升高达8倍，同时压缩比和数据质量更高。

Conclusion: GPZ为大规模粒子数据的压缩提供了高效解决方案，显著优于现有技术。

Abstract: Particle-based simulations and point-cloud applications generate massive,
irregular datasets that challenge storage, I/O, and real-time analytics.
Traditional compression techniques struggle with irregular particle
distributions and GPU architectural constraints, often resulting in limited
throughput and suboptimal compression ratios. In this paper, we present GPZ, a
high-performance, error-bounded lossy compressor designed specifically for
large-scale particle data on modern GPUs. GPZ employs a novel four-stage
parallel pipeline that synergistically balances high compression efficiency
with the architectural demands of massively parallel hardware. We introduce a
suite of targeted optimizations for computation, memory access, and GPU
occupancy that enables GPZ to achieve near-hardware-limit throughput. We
conduct an extensive evaluation on three distinct GPU architectures
(workstation, data center, and edge) using six large-scale, real-world
scientific datasets from five distinct domains. The results demonstrate that
GPZ consistently and significantly outperforms five state-of-the-art GPU
compressors, delivering up to 8x higher end-to-end throughput while
simultaneously achieving superior compression ratios and data quality.

Result: 实验表明，FlexP-SFL在个性化微调效率和最终准确率上优于基线模型。

Conclusion: FlexP-SFL为资源受限和异构环境下的个性化联邦学习提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Fine-tuning foundation models is critical for superior performance on
personalized downstream tasks, compared to using pre-trained models.
Collaborative learning can leverage local clients' datasets for fine-tuning,
but limited client data and heterogeneous data distributions hinder effective
collaboration. To address the challenge, we propose a flexible personalized
federated learning paradigm that enables clients to engage in collaborative
learning while maintaining personalized objectives. Given the limited and
heterogeneous computational resources available on clients, we introduce
\textbf{flexible personalized split federated learning (FlexP-SFL)}. Based on
split learning, FlexP-SFL allows each client to train a portion of the model
locally while offloading the rest to a server, according to resource
constraints. Additionally, we propose an alignment strategy to improve
personalized model performance on global data. Experimental results show that
FlexP-SFL outperforms baseline models in personalized fine-tuning efficiency
and final accuracy.

Abstract: In this paper we present CQ, a specification for a C-like API for quantum
accelerated HPC, as well as CQ-SimBE, a reference implementation of CQ written
in C99, and built on top of the statevector simulator QuEST. CQ focuses on
enabling the incremental integration of quantum computing into classical HPC
codes by supporting runtime offloading from languages such as C and Fortran. It
provides a way of describing and offloading quantum computations which is
compatible with strictly and strongly typed compiled languages, and gives the
programmer fine-grained control over classical data movement. The CQ Simulated
Backend (CQ-SimBE) provides both a way to demonstrate the usage and utility of
CQ, and a space to experiment with new features such as support for analogue
quantum computing. Both the CQ specification and CQ-SimBE are open-source, and
available in public repositories.

### [8] [Meta-Metrics and Best Practices for System-Level Inference Performance Benchmarking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10251)
*Shweta Salaria,Zhuoran Liu,Nelson Mimura Gonzalez*

Main category: cs.PF

TL;DR: FMwork是一个系统化的基准测试框架，用于高效评估基础模型（如LLM）的推理性能，通过元指标、参数选择和成本性能分析，显著提升实验效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估基础模型的推理性能涉及复杂的硬件和软件交互，全面测试不切实际，因此需要一种高效的方法。

Method: FMwork框架包括元指标、参数选择和成本性能分析，优化实验设计和执行。

Result: 使用FMwork可将实验效率提升24倍，同时保持高准确性（如96.6%）。

Conclusion: FMwork为基准测试提供了一种高效且准确的方法，显著减少了实验成本和时间。

Abstract: Benchmarking inference performance (speed) of Foundation Models such as Large
Language Models (LLM) involves navigating a vast experimental landscape to
understand the complex interactions between hardware and software components.
However, evaluating every possible test configuration is impractical,
unfeasible and unnecessary. To address this challenge, we introduce FMwork, a
comprehensive and methodical approach to creating a controlled testing
environment that accurately reflects and characterizes performance. FMwork
comprises a set of benchmkaring best practices with three key components: 1)
meta-metrics, 2) parameter selection, and 3) strategic cost-performance
evaluation. Meta-metrics account for time and resources spent on benchmarking
and the relative accuracy of the results compared to a larger body of
measurements, representing the complete experimental space. FMwork
operationalizes the meta-metrics and provides efficient strategies for
parameter selection and cost-performance analysis. Using the framework, we show
up to 24x improvement (speedup and/or resource savings) running sweeps of
experiments compared to the ground truth. Even already considering a subset of
experiments as reference point (using the power of two for batch sizes),
reducing experimental output size from 1024 to 128 tokens yields another 2.7x
gain while keeping 96.6% accuracy for an evaluation using Llama 3.1 8B model.

### [9] [OpenFPL: An open-source forecasting method rivaling state-of-the-art Fantasy Premier League services](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09992)
*Daniel Groos*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: OpenFPL是一个开源方法，用于预测Fantasy Premier League球员表现，基于公开数据，准确性媲美商业服务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 商业预测服务依赖专有数据和封闭方法，OpenFPL旨在通过开源方法提供高精度预测，降低参与门槛。

Method: 使用位置特定的集成模型，基于2020-21至2023-24赛季的公开数据优化。

Result: 在2024-25赛季测试中，OpenFPL准确性媲美商业服务，对高回报球员预测更优。

Conclusion: OpenFPL为玩家提供长期规划和短期决策支持，推动了预测技术的民主化。

Abstract: Fantasy Premier League engages the football community in selecting the
Premier League players who will perform best from gameweek to gameweek. Access
to accurate performance forecasts gives participants an edge over competitors
by guiding expectations about player outcomes and reducing uncertainty in squad
selection. However, high-accuracy forecasts are currently limited to commercial
services whose inner workings are undisclosed and that rely on proprietary
data. This paper aims to democratize access to highly accurate forecasts of
player performance by presenting OpenFPL, an open-source Fantasy Premier League
forecasting method developed exclusively from public data. Comprising
position-specific ensemble models optimized on Fantasy Premier League and
Understat data from four previous seasons (2020-21 to 2023-24), OpenFPL
achieves accuracy comparable to a leading commercial service when tested
prospectively on data from the 2024-25 season. OpenFPL also surpasses the
commercial benchmark for high-return players ($>$ 2 points), which are most
influential for rank gains. These findings hold across one-, two-, and
three-gameweek forecast horizons, supporting long-term planning of transfers
and strategies while also informing final-day decisions.

### [10] [xRFM: Accurate, scalable, and interpretable feature learning models for tabular data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10053)
*Daniel Beaglehole,David Holzmüller,Adityanarayanan Radhakrishnan,Mikhail Belkin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: xRFM是一种结合特征学习核机器与树结构的算法，用于表格数据的预测任务，性能优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管表格数据推断在现代技术和科学中至关重要，但其最佳实践仍主要基于GBDTs，缺乏创新。xRFM旨在利用神经网络和特征学习的最新进展，提升表格数据的预测性能。

Method: xRFM结合特征学习核机器与树结构，既能适应数据的局部结构，又能扩展到无限训练数据。

Result: 在100个回归数据集和200个分类数据集上，xRFM性能优于31种其他方法，包括TabPFNv2和GBDTs。

Conclusion: xRFM不仅性能优越，还通过平均梯度外积提供原生可解释性。

Abstract: Inference from tabular data, collections of continuous and categorical
variables organized into matrices, is a foundation for modern technology and
science. Yet, in contrast to the explosive changes in the rest of AI, the best
practice for these predictive tasks has been relatively unchanged and is still
primarily based on variations of Gradient Boosted Decision Trees (GBDTs). Very
recently, there has been renewed interest in developing state-of-the-art
methods for tabular data based on recent developments in neural networks and
feature learning methods. In this work, we introduce xRFM, an algorithm that
combines feature learning kernel machines with a tree structure to both adapt
to the local structure of the data and scale to essentially unlimited amounts
of training data.
  We show that compared to $31$ other methods, including recently introduced
tabular foundation models (TabPFNv2) and GBDTs, xRFM achieves best performance
across $100$ regression datasets and is competitive to the best methods across
$200$ classification datasets outperforming GBDTs. Additionally, xRFM provides
interpretability natively through the Average Gradient Outer Product.

TL;DR: PEARL研究首次大规模评估了基于强化学习算法的个性化健康干预，结果显示RL组在1和2个月后步数显著增加。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决全球普遍缺乏运动的问题，探索mHealth干预的潜力，尤其是结合行为科学的个性化方法。

Method: 13,463名Fitbit用户随机分为四组：对照组、随机组、固定组和RL组，RL组通过强化学习算法个性化推送运动提示。

Result: RL组在1和2个月后步数显著高于其他组，1个月时比对照组多296步（p=0.0002）。

Conclusion: 行为科学驱动的强化学习算法可有效个性化数字健康干预，促进运动。

Abstract: Consistent physical inactivity poses a major global health challenge. Mobile
health (mHealth) interventions, particularly Just-in-Time Adaptive
Interventions (JITAIs), offer a promising avenue for scalable, personalized
physical activity (PA) promotion. However, developing and evaluating such
interventions at scale, while integrating robust behavioral science, presents
methodological hurdles. The PEARL study was the first large-scale, four-arm
randomized controlled trial to assess a reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm,
informed by health behavior change theory, to personalize the content and
timing of PA nudges via a Fitbit app.
  We enrolled and randomized 13,463 Fitbit users into four study arms: control,
random, fixed, and RL. The control arm received no nudges. The other three arms
received nudges from a bank of 155 nudges based on behavioral science
principles. The random arm received nudges selected at random. The fixed arm
received nudges based on a pre-set logic from survey responses about PA
barriers. The RL group received nudges selected by an adaptive RL algorithm. We
included 7,711 participants in primary analyses (mean age 42.1, 86.3% female,
baseline steps 5,618.2).
  We observed an increase in PA for the RL group compared to all other groups
from baseline to 1 and 2 months. The RL group had significantly increased
average daily step count at 1 month compared to all other groups: control (+296
steps, p=0.0002), random (+218 steps, p=0.005), and fixed (+238 steps,
p=0.002). At 2 months, the RL group sustained a significant increase compared
to the control group (+210 steps, p=0.0122). Generalized estimating equation
models also revealed a sustained increase in daily steps in the RL group vs.
control (+208 steps, p=0.002). These findings demonstrate the potential of a
scalable, behaviorally-informed RL approach to personalize digital health
interventions for PA.

### [12] [Measuring Time Series Forecast Stability for Demand Planning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10063)
*Steven Klee,Yuntian Xia*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文探讨了时间序列预测中模型稳定性与准确性的平衡，提出模型诱导随机性概念，并通过案例研究表明集成模型能提升稳定性而不显著降低准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 需求规划师更看重预测的稳定性和一致性，而非仅追求准确性提升。模型预测的剧烈波动会增加人工干预，降低信任。

Method: 研究模型诱导随机性，量化固定输入下模型的预测方差，并通过M5和Favorita数据集评估多种先进模型的稳定性和准确性。

Result: 集成模型在保持或提升准确性的同时显著提高了稳定性。

Conclusion: 建议进一步研究生产系统中模型的预测稳定性，强调稳定性与准确性并重的重要性。

Abstract: Time series forecasting is a critical first step in generating demand plans
for supply chains. Experiments on time series models typically focus on
demonstrating improvements in forecast accuracy over existing/baseline
solutions, quantified according to some accuracy metric. There is no doubt that
forecast accuracy is important; however in production systems, demand planners
often value consistency and stability over incremental accuracy improvements.
Assuming that the inputs have not changed significantly, forecasts that vary
drastically from one planning cycle to the next require high amounts of human
intervention, which frustrates demand planners and can even cause them to lose
trust in ML forecasting models. We study model-induced stochasticity, which
quantifies the variance of a set of forecasts produced by a single model when
the set of inputs is fixed. Models with lower variance are more stable.
  Recently the forecasting community has seen significant advances in forecast
accuracy through the development of deep machine learning models for time
series forecasting. We perform a case study measuring the stability and
accuracy of state-of-the-art forecasting models (Chronos, DeepAR, PatchTST,
Temporal Fusion Transformer, TiDE, and the AutoGluon best quality ensemble) on
public data sets from the M5 competition and Favorita grocery sales. We show
that ensemble models improve stability without significantly deteriorating (or
even improving) forecast accuracy. While these results may not be surprising,
the main point of this paper is to propose the need for further study of
forecast stability for models that are being deployed in production systems.

Result: 在C++代码填充和JSON数据提取等应用中，方法实现了近乎完美的语法正确性，且计算开销可控。

Conclusion: 该方法为扩散语言模型提供了高效的约束解码方案，同时保持或提升了功能正确性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown promising performance across diverse
domains. Many practical applications of LLMs, such as code completion and
structured data extraction, require adherence to syntactic constraints
specified by a formal language. Yet, due to their probabilistic nature, LLM
output is not guaranteed to adhere to such formal languages. Prior work has
proposed constrained decoding as a means to restrict LLM generation to
particular formal languages. However, existing works are not applicable to the
emerging paradigm of diffusion LLMs, when used in practical scenarios such as
the generation of formally correct C++ or JSON output. In this paper we address
this challenge and present the first constrained decoding method for diffusion
models, one that can handle formal languages captured by context-free grammars.
We begin by reducing constrained decoding to the more general additive
infilling problem, which asks whether a partial output can be completed to a
valid word in the target language. This problem also naturally subsumes the
previously unaddressed multi-region infilling constrained decoding. We then
reduce this problem to the task of deciding whether the intersection of the
target language and a regular language is empty and present an efficient
algorithm to solve it for context-free languages. Empirical results on various
applications, such as C++ code infilling and structured data extraction in
JSON, demonstrate that our method achieves near-perfect syntactic correctness
while consistently preserving or improving functional correctness. Importantly,
our efficiency optimizations ensure that the computational overhead remains
practical.

Result: 小型LLMs能通过训练解决图任务，并可泛化到新任务和结构。

Conclusion: LLMs无需专用图编码器即可有效解决图任务，并具备泛化能力。

Abstract: For large language models (LLMs), reasoning over graphs could help solve many
problems. Prior work has tried to improve LLM graph reasoning by examining how
best to serialize graphs as text and by combining GNNs and LLMs. However, the
merits of such approaches remain unclear, so we empirically answer the
following research questions: (1) Can LLMs learn to solve fundamental graph
tasks without specialized graph encoding models?, (2) Can LLMs generalize
learned solutions to unseen graph structures or tasks?, and (3) What are the
merits of competing approaches to learn graph tasks? We show that even small
LLMs can learn to solve graph tasks by training them with instructive
chain-of-thought solutions, and this training generalizes, without specialized
graph encoders, to new tasks and graph structures.

TL;DR: CAD-RL是一种结合多模态思维链和强化学习的框架，用于自动化生成CAD建模代码，显著提升了推理质量、输出精度和代码可执行性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前CAD工作流程需要大量领域专业知识和手动建模，而现有方法难以直接将人类设计意图转化为可执行的CAD代码。

Method: 提出CAD-RL框架，结合思维链引导的强化学习，采用三种任务特定奖励和三种优化策略。

Result: 实验表明，CAD-RL在推理质量、输出精度和代码可执行性上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: CAD-RL为自动化CAD建模提供了高效解决方案，并发布了ExeCAD数据集支持训练和基准测试。

Abstract: Computer-Aided Design (CAD) plays a vital role in engineering and
manufacturing, yet current CAD workflows require extensive domain expertise and
manual modeling effort. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have
made it possible to generate code from natural language, opening new
opportunities for automating parametric 3D modeling. However, directly
translating human design intent into executable CAD code remains highly
challenging, due to the need for logical reasoning, syntactic correctness, and
numerical precision. In this work, we propose CAD-RL, a multimodal
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) guided reinforcement learning post training framework
for CAD modeling code generation. Our method combines CoT-based Cold Start with
goal-driven reinforcement learning post training using three task-specific
rewards: executability reward, geometric accuracy reward, and external
evaluation reward. To ensure stable policy learning under sparse and
high-variance reward conditions, we introduce three targeted optimization
strategies: Trust Region Stretch for improved exploration, Precision Token Loss
for enhanced dimensions parameter accuracy, and Overlong Filtering to reduce
noisy supervision. To support training and benchmarking, we release ExeCAD, a
noval dataset comprising 16,540 real-world CAD examples with paired natural
language and structured design language descriptions, executable CADQuery
scripts, and rendered 3D models. Experiments demonstrate that CAD-RL achieves
significant improvements in reasoning quality, output precision, and code
executability over existing VLMs.

can be tackled using verifiable rewards based reinforced fine-tuning (ReFT). In
standard ReFT frameworks, a behavior model generates multiple completions with
answers per problem, for the answer to be then scored by a reward function.
While such RL post-training methods demonstrate significant performance
improvements across challenging reasoning domains, the computational cost of
generating completions during training with multiple inference steps makes the
training cost non-trivial. To address this, we draw inspiration from off-policy
RL, and speculative decoding to introduce a novel ReFT framework, dubbed
Nested-ReFT, where a subset of layers of the target model acts as the behavior
model to generate off-policy completions during training. The behavior model
configured with dynamic layer skipping per batch during training decreases the
inference cost compared to the standard ReFT frameworks. Our theoretical
analysis shows that Nested-ReFT yields unbiased gradient estimates with
controlled variance. Our empirical analysis demonstrates improved computational
efficiency measured as tokens/sec across multiple math reasoning benchmarks and
model sizes. Additionally, we explore three variants of bias mitigation to
minimize the off-policyness in the gradient updates that allows for maintaining
performance that matches the baseline ReFT performance.

Conclusion: 研究表明，将预训练目标与理论支持的嵌入几何对齐，能显著提升时间序列分类性能。

Abstract: Deep neural networks for time series must capture complex temporal patterns,
to effectively represent dynamic data. Self- and semi-supervised learning
methods show promising results in pre-training large models, which -- when
finetuned for classification -- often outperform their counterparts trained
from scratch. Still, the choice of pretext training tasks is often heuristic
and their transferability to downstream classification is not granted, thus we
propose a novel semi-supervised pre-training strategy to enforce latent
representations that satisfy the Neural Collapse phenomenon observed in
optimally trained neural classifiers. We use a rotational equiangular tight
frame-classifier and pseudo-labeling to pre-train deep encoders with few
labeled samples. Furthermore, to effectively capture temporal dynamics while
enforcing embedding separability, we integrate generative pretext tasks with
our method, and we define a novel sequential augmentation strategy. We show
that our method significantly outperforms previous pretext tasks when applied
to LSTMs, transformers, and state-space models on three multivariate time
series classification datasets. These results highlight the benefit of aligning
pre-training objectives with theoretically grounded embedding geometry.

Conclusion: 该方法不仅检测性能优越，还能通过反事实解释提供结果的可解释性。

Abstract: Accurate and explainable out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is required to
use machine learning systems safely. Previous work has shown that feature
distance to decision boundaries can be used to identify OOD data effectively.
In this paper, we build on this intuition and propose a post-hoc OOD detection
method that, given an input, calculates the distance to decision boundaries by
leveraging counterfactual explanations. Since computing explanations can be
expensive for large architectures, we also propose strategies to improve
scalability by computing counterfactuals directly in embedding space.
Crucially, as the method employs counterfactual explanations, we can seamlessly
use them to help interpret the results of our detector. We show that our method
is in line with the state of the art on CIFAR-10, achieving 93.50% AUROC and
25.80% FPR95. Our method outperforms these methods on CIFAR-100 with 97.05%
AUROC and 13.79% FPR95 and on ImageNet-200 with 92.55% AUROC and 33.55% FPR95
across four OOD datasets

Abstract: Mixture models have attracted significant attention due to practical
effectiveness and comprehensive theoretical foundations. A persisting challenge
is model misspecification, which occurs when the model to be fitted has more
mixture components than those in the data distribution. In this paper, we
develop a theoretical understanding of the Expectation-Maximization (EM)
algorithm's behavior in the context of targeted model misspecification for
overspecified two-component Mixed Linear Regression (2MLR) with unknown
$d$-dimensional regression parameters and mixing weights. In Theorem 5.1 at the
population level, with an unbalanced initial guess for mixing weights, we
establish linear convergence of regression parameters in $O(\log(1/\epsilon))$
steps. Conversely, with a balanced initial guess for mixing weights, we observe
sublinear convergence in $O(\epsilon^{-2})$ steps to achieve the
$\epsilon$-accuracy at Euclidean distance. In Theorem 6.1 at the finite-sample
level, for mixtures with sufficiently unbalanced fixed mixing weights, we
demonstrate a statistical accuracy of $O((d/n)^{1/2})$, whereas for those with
sufficiently balanced fixed mixing weights, the accuracy is $O((d/n)^{1/4})$
given $n$ data samples. Furthermore, we underscore the connection between our
population level and finite-sample level results: by setting the desired final
accuracy $\epsilon$ in Theorem 5.1 to match that in Theorem 6.1 at the
finite-sample level, namely letting $\epsilon = O((d/n)^{1/2})$ for
sufficiently unbalanced fixed mixing weights and $\epsilon = O((d/n)^{1/4})$
for sufficiently balanced fixed mixing weights, we intuitively derive iteration
complexity bounds $O(\log (1/\epsilon))=O(\log (n/d))$ and
$O(\epsilon^{-2})=O((n/d)^{1/2})$ at the finite-sample level for sufficiently
unbalanced and balanced initial mixing weights. We further extend our analysis
in overspecified setting to low SNR regime.

Result: 研究发现，有影响力的基准测试可以作为训练课程，而非仅用于测试，从而提升模型的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 论文提出，基准测试的选择对AI发展至关重要，某些基准更适合作为训练课程而非测试集。

Abstract: Evaluation of reasoning language models gained importance after it was
observed that they can combine their existing capabilities into novel traces of
intermediate steps before task completion and that the traces can sometimes
help them to generalize better than past models. As reasoning becomes the next
scaling dimension of large language models, careful study of their capabilities
in critical tasks is needed. We show that better performance is not always
caused by test-time algorithmic improvements or model sizes but also by using
impactful benchmarks as curricula for learning. We call this benchmark-driven
selection of AI and show its effects on DeepSeek-R1 using our sequential
decision-making problem from Humanity's Last Exam. Steering development of AI
by impactful benchmarks trades evaluation for learning and makes novelty of
test tasks key for measuring generalization capabilities of reasoning models.
Consequently, some benchmarks could be seen as curricula for training rather
than unseen test sets.

Abstract: Monitoring cattle health and optimizing yield are key challenges faced by
dairy farmers due to difficulties in tracking all animals on the farm. This
work aims to showcase modern data-driven farming practices based on explainable
machine learning(ML) methods that explain the activity and behaviour of dairy
cattle (cows). Continuous data collection of 3-axis accelerometer sensors and
usage of robust ML methodologies and algorithms, provide farmers and
researchers with actionable information on cattle activity, allowing farmers to
make informed decisions and incorporate sustainable practices. This study
utilizes Bluetooth-based Internet of Things (IoT) devices and 4G networks for
seamless data transmission, immediate analysis, inference generation, and
explains the models performance with explainability frameworks. Special
emphasis is put on the pre-processing of the accelerometers time series data,
including the extraction of statistical characteristics, signal processing
techniques, and lag-based features using the sliding window technique. Various
hyperparameter-optimized ML models are evaluated across varying window lengths
for activity classification. The k-nearest neighbour Classifier achieved the
best performance, with AUC of mean 0.98 and standard deviation of 0.0026 on the
training set and 0.99 on testing set). In order to ensure transparency,
Explainable AI based frameworks such as SHAP is used to interpret feature
importance that can be understood and used by practitioners. A detailed
comparison of the important features, along with the stability analysis of
selected features, supports development of explainable and practical ML models
for sustainable livestock management.

Conclusion: AI手写分析为野生动物取证提供新方法，可补充现有技术，助力打击犯罪。

Abstract: The transnational ivory trade continues to drive the decline of elephant
populations across Africa, and trafficking networks remain difficult to
disrupt. Tusks seized by law enforcement officials carry forensic information
on the traffickers responsible for their export, including DNA evidence and
handwritten markings made by traffickers. For 20 years, analyses of tusk DNA
have identified where elephants were poached and established connections among
shipments of ivory. While the links established using genetic evidence are
extremely conclusive, genetic data is expensive and sometimes impossible to
obtain. But though handwritten markings are easy to photograph, they are rarely
documented or analyzed. Here, we present an AI-driven pipeline for extracting
and analyzing handwritten markings on seized elephant tusks, offering a novel,
scalable, and low-cost source of forensic evidence. Having collected 6,085
photographs from eight large seizures of ivory over a 6-year period
(2014-2019), we used an object detection model to extract over 17,000
individual markings, which were then labeled and described using
state-of-the-art AI tools. We identified 184 recurring "signature markings"
that connect the tusks on which they appear. 20 signature markings were
observed in multiple seizures, establishing forensic links between these
seizures through traffickers involved in both shipments. This work complements
other investigative techniques by filling in gaps where other data sources are
unavailable. The study demonstrates the transformative potential of AI in
wildlife forensics and highlights practical steps for integrating handwriting
analysis into efforts to disrupt organized wildlife crime.

Motivation: 评估量子退火器在RBM采样中的表现，探索其潜在改进空间。

Method: 使用局部谷（LV）中心方法比较D-Wave和Gibbs采样的结果，分析其覆盖范围和能量。

Result: D-Wave采样覆盖更多LV，但与Gibbs采样重叠度高，后期训练阶段互补性降低。

Conclusion: 量子退火器未显著提升采样质量，但结合经典-量子方法可能带来改进。

Abstract: A local-valley (LV) centered approach to assessing the quality of sampling
from Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs) was applied to the latest generation
of the D-Wave quantum annealer. D-Wave and Gibbs samples from a classically
trained RBM were obtained at conditions relevant to the
contrastive-divergence-based RBM learning. The samples were compared for the
number of the LVs to which they belonged and the energy of the corresponding
local minima. No significant (desirable) increase in the number of the LVs has
been achieved by decreasing the D-Wave annealing time. At any training epoch,
the states sampled by the D-Wave belonged to a somewhat higher number of LVs
than in the Gibbs sampling. However, many of those LVs found by the two
techniques differed. For high-probability sampled states, the two techniques
were (unfavorably) less complementary and more overlapping. Nevertheless, many
potentially "important" local minima, i.e., those having intermediate, even if
not high, probability values, were found by only one of the two sampling
techniques while missed by the other. The two techniques overlapped less at
later than earlier training epochs, which is precisely the stage of the
training when modest improvements to the sampling quality could make meaningful
differences for the RBM trainability. The results of this work may explain the
failure of previous investigations to achieve substantial (or any) improvement
when using D-Wave-based sampling. However, the results reveal some potential
for improvement, e.g., using a combined classical-quantum approach.

Motivation: 肝硬化患者AKI发生率高且预后差，现有预测工具准确性不足且难以融入ICU工作流程。

Method: 回顾性分析MIMIC-IV数据库，提取48小时内实验室和生理数据，采用多种算法训练和评估。

Result: LightGBM表现最优（AUROC 0.808），关键预测因子与AKI机制一致。

Conclusion: 该模型能准确分层AKI风险，高阴性预测值支持低风险患者管理，需进一步外部验证。

Abstract: Background: Cirrhosis is a progressive liver disease with high mortality and
frequent complications, notably acute kidney injury (AKI), which occurs in up
to 50% of hospitalized patients and worsens outcomes. AKI stems from complex
hemodynamic, inflammatory, and metabolic changes, making early detection
essential. Many predictive tools lack accuracy, interpretability, and alignment
with intensive care unit (ICU) workflows. This study developed an interpretable
machine learning model for early AKI prediction in critically ill patients with
cirrhosis.
  Methods: We conducted a retrospective analysis of the MIMIC-IV v2.2 database,
identifying 1240 adult ICU patients with cirrhosis and excluding those with ICU
stays under 48 hours or missing key data. Laboratory and physiological
variables from the first 48 hours were extracted. The pipeline included
preprocessing, missingness filtering, LASSO feature selection, and SMOTE class
balancing. Six algorithms-LightGBM, CatBoost, XGBoost, logistic regression,
naive Bayes, and neural networks-were trained and evaluated using AUROC,
accuracy, F1-score, sensitivity, specificity, and predictive values.
  Results: LightGBM achieved the best performance (AUROC 0.808, 95% CI
0.741-0.856; accuracy 0.704; NPV 0.911). Key predictors included prolonged
partial thromboplastin time, absence of outside-facility 20G placement, low pH,
and altered pO2, consistent with known cirrhosis-AKI mechanisms and suggesting
actionable targets.
  Conclusion: The LightGBM-based model enables accurate early AKI risk
stratification in ICU patients with cirrhosis using routine clinical variables.
Its high negative predictive value supports safe de-escalation for low-risk
patients, and interpretability fosters clinician trust and targeted prevention.
External validation and integration into electronic health record systems are
warranted.

Result: 模型能够从少量示例中学习并推断出密码规则，展示了ICL在结构化推理任务中的有效性。

Conclusion: ICL在密码函数学习中具有潜力，为Transformer模型的推理能力提供了新的评估方向。

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) has emerged as a powerful capability of
transformer-based language models, enabling them to perform tasks by
conditioning on a small number of examples presented at inference time, without
any parameter updates. Prior work has shown that transformers can generalize
over simple function classes like linear functions, decision trees, even neural
networks, purely from context, focusing on numerical or symbolic reasoning over
underlying well-structured functions. Instead, we propose a novel application
of ICL into the domain of cryptographic function learning, specifically
focusing on ciphers such as mono-alphabetic substitution and Vigen\`ere
ciphers, two classes of private-key encryption schemes. These ciphers involve a
fixed but hidden bijective mapping between plain text and cipher text
characters. Given a small set of (cipher text, plain text) pairs, the goal is
for the model to infer the underlying substitution and decode a new cipher text
word. This setting poses a structured inference challenge, which is well-suited
for evaluating the inductive biases and generalization capabilities of
transformers under the ICL paradigm. Code is available at

Motivation: 现有Transformer后门攻击方法依赖重新训练或修改架构，资源消耗大且侵入性强，需更高效隐蔽的方案。

Method: HPMI方法通过修剪不重要头部并注入预训练恶意头部，无需重新训练或修改架构。

Result: 实验显示HPMI攻击成功率达99.55%以上，且能绕过四种先进防御机制，对干净数据精度影响极小。

Conclusion: HPMI是一种高效隐蔽的后门攻击方法，优于现有依赖重新训练的攻击，且对防御策略更具鲁棒性。

Abstract: Transformer models have demonstrated exceptional performance and have become
indispensable in computer vision (CV) and natural language processing (NLP)
tasks. However, recent studies reveal that transformers are susceptible to
backdoor attacks. Prior backdoor attack methods typically rely on retraining
with clean data or altering the model architecture, both of which can be
resource-intensive and intrusive. In this paper, we propose Head-wise Pruning
and Malicious Injection (HPMI), a novel retraining-free backdoor attack on
transformers that does not alter the model's architecture. Our approach
requires only a small subset of the original data and basic knowledge of the
model architecture, eliminating the need for retraining the target transformer.
Technically, HPMI works by pruning the least important head and injecting a
pre-trained malicious head to establish the backdoor. We provide a rigorous
theoretical justification demonstrating that the implanted backdoor resists
detection and removal by state-of-the-art defense techniques, under reasonable
assumptions. Experimental evaluations across multiple datasets further validate
the effectiveness of HPMI, showing that it 1) incurs negligible clean accuracy
loss, 2) achieves at least 99.55% attack success rate, and 3) bypasses four
advanced defense mechanisms. Additionally, relative to state-of-the-art
retraining-dependent attacks, HPMI achieves greater concealment and robustness
against diverse defense strategies, while maintaining minimal impact on clean
accuracy.

Abstract: This paper addresses the challenges of high resource dynamism and scheduling
complexity in cloud-native database systems. It proposes an adaptive resource
orchestration method based on multi-agent reinforcement learning. The method
introduces a heterogeneous role-based agent modeling mechanism. This allows
different resource entities, such as compute nodes, storage nodes, and
schedulers, to adopt distinct policy representations. These agents are better
able to reflect diverse functional responsibilities and local environmental
characteristics within the system. A reward-shaping mechanism is designed to
integrate local observations with global feedback. This helps mitigate policy
learning bias caused by incomplete state observations. By combining real-time
local performance signals with global system value estimation, the mechanism
improves coordination among agents and enhances policy convergence stability. A
unified multi-agent training framework is developed and evaluated on a
representative production scheduling dataset. Experimental results show that
the proposed method outperforms traditional approaches across multiple key
metrics. These include resource utilization, scheduling latency, policy
convergence speed, system stability, and fairness. The results demonstrate
strong generalization and practical utility. Across various experimental
scenarios, the method proves effective in handling orchestration tasks with
high concurrency, high-dimensional state spaces, and complex dependency
relationships. This confirms its advantages in real-world, large-scale
scheduling environments.

Abstract: This paper proposes an anomaly detection method based on federated learning
to address key challenges in multi-tenant cloud environments, including data
privacy leakage, heterogeneous resource behavior, and the limitations of
centralized modeling. The method establishes a federated training framework
involving multiple tenants. Each tenant trains the model locally using private
resource usage data. Through parameter aggregation, a global model is
optimized, enabling cross-tenant collaborative anomaly detection while
preserving data privacy. To improve adaptability to diverse resource usage
patterns, a personalized parameter adjustment mechanism is introduced. This
allows the model to retain tenant-specific feature representations while
sharing global knowledge. In the model output stage, the Mahalanobis distance
is used to compute anomaly scores. This enhances both the accuracy and
stability of anomaly detection. The experiments use real telemetry data from a
cloud platform to construct a simulated multi-tenant environment. The study
evaluates the model's performance under varying participation rates and noise
injection levels. These comparisons demonstrate the proposed method's
robustness and detection accuracy. Experimental results show that the proposed
method outperforms existing mainstream models across key metrics such as
Precision, Recall, and F1-Score. It also maintains stable performance in
various complex scenarios. These findings highlight the method's practical
potential for intelligent resource monitoring and anomaly diagnosis in cloud

Abstract: This paper addresses source component shift adaptation, aiming to update
predictions adapting to source component shifts for incoming data streams based
on past training data. Existing online learning methods often fail to utilize
recurring shifts effectively, while model-pool-based methods struggle to
capture individual source components, leading to poor adaptation. In this
paper, we propose a source component shift adaptation method via an offline
decomposition and online mixing approach. We theoretically identify that the
problem can be divided into two subproblems: offline source component
decomposition and online mixing weight adaptation. Based on this, our method
first determines prediction models, each of which learns a source component
solely based on past training data offline through the EM algorithm. Then, it
updates the mixing weight of the prediction models for precise prediction
through online convex optimization. Thanks to our theoretical derivation, our
method fully leverages the characteristics of the shifts, achieving superior
adaptation performance over existing methods. Experiments conducted on various
real-world regression datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms

Motivation: 帕金森病药物管理因疾病进展和治疗的异质性而复杂，现有方法缺乏系统性预测和不确定性量化，导致临床决策困难。

Method: 采用两阶段共形预测框架，处理零膨胀数据，预测未来两年的药物需求，并提供统计保证的预测区间。

Result: 在631例住院患者数据中，该方法实现了边际覆盖并缩短了预测区间长度，为短期和长期规划提供了精确预测。

Conclusion: 通过量化不确定性，该方法支持基于证据的药物调整，优化症状控制并减少副作用，提高患者生活质量。

Abstract: Parkinson's Disease (PD) medication management presents unique challenges due
to heterogeneous disease progression and treatment response. Neurologists must
balance symptom control with optimal dopaminergic dosing based on functional
disability while minimizing side effects. This balance is crucial as inadequate
or abrupt changes can cause levodopa-induced dyskinesia, wearing off, and
neuropsychiatric effects, significantly reducing quality of life. Current
approaches rely on trial-and-error decisions without systematic predictive
methods. Despite machine learning advances, clinical adoption remains limited
due to reliance on point predictions that do not account for prediction
uncertainty, undermining clinical trust and utility. Clinicians require not
only predictions of future medication needs but also reliable confidence
measures. Without quantified uncertainty, adjustments risk premature escalation
to maximum doses or prolonged inadequate symptom control. We developed a
conformal prediction framework anticipating medication needs up to two years in
advance with reliable prediction intervals and statistical guarantees. Our
approach addresses zero-inflation in PD inpatient data, where patients maintain
stable medication regimens between visits. Using electronic health records from
631 inpatient admissions at University of Florida Health (2011-2021), our
two-stage approach identifies patients likely to need medication changes, then
predicts required levodopa equivalent daily dose adjustments. Our framework
achieved marginal coverage while reducing prediction interval lengths compared
to traditional approaches, providing precise predictions for short-term
planning and wider ranges for long-term forecasting. By quantifying
uncertainty, our approach enables evidence-based decisions about levodopa
dosing, optimizing symptom control while minimizing side effects and improving
life quality.

TL;DR: SynBrain是一个生成框架，通过概率建模将视觉语义转化为神经响应，解决了现有确定性方法难以同时建模生物变异性和功能一致性的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉刺激到神经响应的映射是一对多的关系，现有方法难以同时捕捉生物变异性和功能一致性，因此提出SynBrain。

Method: SynBrain包含BrainVAE（通过概率学习建模神经响应）和语义到神经映射器（将视觉语义投射到神经响应流形）。

Result: SynBrain在视觉到fMRI编码性能上优于现有方法，适应新受试者快，且能提升数据有限的fMRI到图像解码性能。

Conclusion: SynBrain不仅性能优越，还能揭示跨试验和受试者的功能一致性，其代码将公开。

Abstract: Deciphering how visual stimuli are transformed into cortical responses is a
fundamental challenge in computational neuroscience. This visual-to-neural
mapping is inherently a one-to-many relationship, as identical visual inputs
reliably evoke variable hemodynamic responses across trials, contexts, and
subjects. However, existing deterministic methods struggle to simultaneously
model this biological variability while capturing the underlying functional
consistency that encodes stimulus information. To address these limitations, we
propose SynBrain, a generative framework that simulates the transformation from
visual semantics to neural responses in a probabilistic and biologically
interpretable manner. SynBrain introduces two key components: (i) BrainVAE
models neural representations as continuous probability distributions via
probabilistic learning while maintaining functional consistency through visual
semantic constraints; (ii) A Semantic-to-Neural Mapper acts as a semantic
transmission pathway, projecting visual semantics into the neural response
manifold to facilitate high-fidelity fMRI synthesis. Experimental results
demonstrate that SynBrain surpasses state-of-the-art methods in
subject-specific visual-to-fMRI encoding performance. Furthermore, SynBrain
adapts efficiently to new subjects with few-shot data and synthesizes
high-quality fMRI signals that are effective in improving data-limited
fMRI-to-image decoding performance. Beyond that, SynBrain reveals functional
consistency across trials and subjects, with synthesized signals capturing
interpretable patterns shaped by biological neural variability. The code will
be made publicly available.

TL;DR: FedKEI是一种联邦学习框架，通过跨客户端和跨任务的知识转移，为新任务生成优化的初始化参数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医疗环境中需要快速适应新任务或疾病，同时保护隐私。

Method: 采用全局聚类和双层优化策略，个性化知识转移。

Result: 在皮肤病、胸部X光和视网膜OCT数据集上表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: FedKEI能有效适应新疾病，提升联邦学习效率。

Abstract: In healthcare, federated learning (FL) is a widely adopted framework that
enables privacy-preserving collaboration among medical institutions. With large
foundation models (FMs) demonstrating impressive capabilities, using FMs in FL
through cost-efficient adapter tuning has become a popular approach. Given the
rapidly evolving healthcare environment, it is crucial for individual clients
to quickly adapt to new tasks or diseases by tuning adapters while drawing upon
past experiences. In this work, we introduce Federated Knowledge-Enhanced
Initialization (FedKEI), a novel framework that leverages cross-client and
cross-task transfer from past knowledge to generate informed initializations
for learning new tasks with adapters. FedKEI begins with a global clustering
process at the server to generalize knowledge across tasks, followed by the
optimization of aggregation weights across clusters (inter-cluster weights) and
within each cluster (intra-cluster weights) to personalize knowledge transfer
for each new task. To facilitate more effective learning of the inter- and
intra-cluster weights, we adopt a bi-level optimization scheme that
collaboratively learns the global intra-cluster weights across clients and
optimizes the local inter-cluster weights toward each client's task objective.
Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets of different modalities,
including dermatology, chest X-rays, and retinal OCT, demonstrate FedKEI's
advantage in adapting to new diseases compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Motivation: 现有联邦学习后门防御方法依赖同质数据分布或干净服务器数据集，实用性受限。异构数据分布下的防御及模型性能保持是挑战。

Method: CLIP-Fed结合预聚合和后聚合防御策略，利用多模态大语言模型和频率分析构建服务器数据集，通过原型对比损失和KL散度对齐全局模型与CLIP知识。

Result: 在CIFAR-10和CIFAR-10-LT上，CLIP-Fed平均降低ASR 2.03%和1.35%，同时提高MA 7.92%和0.48%。

Conclusion: CLIP-Fed在异构数据分布下有效防御后门攻击，同时提升模型性能。

Abstract: Existing backdoor defense methods in Federated Learning (FL) rely on the
assumption of homogeneous client data distributions or the availability of a
clean serve dataset, which limits the practicality and effectiveness. Defending
against backdoor attacks under heterogeneous client data distributions while
preserving model performance remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we
propose a FL backdoor defense framework named CLIP-Fed, which leverages the
zero-shot learning capabilities of vision-language pre-training models. By
integrating both pre-aggregation and post-aggregation defense strategies,
CLIP-Fed overcomes the limitations of Non-IID imposed on defense effectiveness.
To address privacy concerns and enhance the coverage of the dataset against
diverse triggers, we construct and augment the server dataset using the
multimodal large language model and frequency analysis without any client
samples. To address class prototype deviations caused by backdoor samples and
eliminate the correlation between trigger patterns and target labels, CLIP-Fed
aligns the knowledge of the global model and CLIP on the augmented dataset
using prototype contrastive loss and Kullback-Leibler divergence. Extensive
experiments on representative datasets validate the effectiveness of CLIP-Fed.
Compared to state-of-the-art methods, CLIP-Fed achieves an average reduction in
ASR, i.e., 2.03\% on CIFAR-10 and 1.35\% on CIFAR-10-LT, while improving
average MA by 7.92\% and 0.48\%, respectively.

Motivation: 传统公平聚类方法可能导致不理想的结果，因此作者提出福利中心化的聚类方法以更好地建模群体效用。

Method: 基于距离和比例代表建模群体效用，提出Rawlsian和Utilitarian两种优化目标，并设计新算法。

Result: 在多个真实数据集上，新方法显著优于现有公平聚类基线。

Conclusion: 福利中心化的聚类方法能更有效地实现公平聚类目标。

Abstract: Fair clustering has traditionally focused on ensuring equitable group
representation or equalizing group-specific clustering costs. However,
Dickerson et al. (2025) recently showed that these fairness notions may yield
undesirable or unintuitive clustering outcomes and advocated for a
welfare-centric clustering approach that models the utilities of the groups. In
this work, we model group utilities based on both distances and proportional
representation and formalize two optimization objectives based on
welfare-centric clustering: the Rawlsian (Egalitarian) objective and the
Utilitarian objective. We introduce novel algorithms for both objectives and
prove theoretical guarantees for them. Empirical evaluations on multiple
real-world datasets demonstrate that our methods significantly outperform
existing fair clustering baselines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: IoMT设备易受网络攻击，传统集中式IDS因延迟和隐私问题不适用，而本地运行IDS又受限于设备资源。

Method: 采用多层级框架，首层（近边缘）使用元学习或OCC算法粗筛流量，后续层（远边缘、云端）识别攻击类型和新颖性。

Result: 在CICIoMT2024数据集上达到99.77%准确率和97.8% F1分数，首层能高效检测零日攻击。

Conclusion: 该框架在IoMT环境中具有强适用性，解决了传统IDS的局限性。

Abstract: The Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) is driving a healthcare revolution but
remains vulnerable to cyberattacks such as denial of service, ransomware, data
hijacking, and spoofing. These networks comprise resource constrained,
heterogeneous devices (e.g., wearable sensors, smart pills, implantables),
making traditional centralized Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) unsuitable
due to response delays, privacy risks, and added vulnerabilities. Centralized
IDSs require all sensors to transmit data to a central server, causing delays
or network disruptions in dense environments. Running IDSs locally on IoMT
devices is often infeasible due to limited computation, and even lightweight
IDS components remain at risk if updated models are delayed leaving them
exposed to zero-day attacks that threaten patient health and data security. We
propose a multi level IoMT IDS framework capable of detecting zero day attacks
and distinguishing between known and unknown threats. The first layer (near
Edge) filters traffic at a coarse level (attack or not) using meta-learning or
One Class Classification (OCC) with the usfAD algorithm. Subsequent layers (far
Edge, Cloud) identify attack type and novelty. Experiments on the CICIoMT2024
dataset show 99.77 percentage accuracy and 97.8 percentage F1-score. The first
layer detects zero-day attacks with high accuracy without needing new datasets,
ensuring strong applicability in IoMT environments. Additionally, the
meta-learning approach achieves high.

Result: 研究发现，即时语义性能优化的编码方案可能牺牲长期可学习性，系统条件对学习速率和性能有显著影响。

Conclusion: 本文首次严格刻画了语义通信中的统计学习问题，并提出了平衡即时性能与适应能力的设计原则。

Abstract: Semantic communication aims to convey meaning rather than bit-perfect
reproduction, representing a paradigm shift from traditional communication.
This paper investigates distribution learning in semantic communication where
receivers must infer the underlying meaning distribution through sequential
observations. While semantic communication traditionally optimizes individual
meaning transmission, we establish fundamental conditions for learning source
statistics when priors are unknown. We prove that learnability requires full
rank of the effective transmission matrix, characterize the convergence rate of
distribution estimation, and quantify how estimation errors translate to
semantic distortion. Our analysis reveals a fundamental trade-off: encoding
schemes optimized for immediate semantic performance often sacrifice long-term
learnability. Experiments on CIFAR-10 validate our theoretical framework,
demonstrating that system conditioning critically impacts both learning rate
and achievable performance. These results provide the first rigorous
characterization of statistical learning in semantic communication and offer
design principles for systems that balance immediate performance with
adaptation capability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mamba模型在边缘设备上的部署缺乏优化的硬件加速框架，限制了其实际应用潜力。

Method: eMamba通过替换复杂归一化层、近似昂贵操作（如SiLU激活和指数运算），并结合近似感知的神经架构搜索（NAS）优化参数。

Result: 在多个数据集上，eMamba以更少的参数实现与先进技术相当的精度，并在FPGA和ASIC上显著降低了延迟、功耗和能耗。

Conclusion: eMamba为Mamba模型在边缘设备上的高效部署提供了可行的解决方案，兼具性能和资源效率。

Abstract: State Space Model (SSM)-based machine learning architectures have recently
gained significant attention for processing sequential data. Mamba, a recent
sequence-to-sequence SSM, offers competitive accuracy with superior
computational efficiency compared to state-of-the-art transformer models. While
this advantage makes Mamba particularly promising for resource-constrained edge
devices, no hardware acceleration frameworks are currently optimized for
deploying it in such environments. This paper presents eMamba, a comprehensive
end-to-end hardware acceleration framework explicitly designed for deploying
Mamba models on edge platforms. eMamba maximizes computational efficiency by
replacing complex normalization layers with lightweight hardware-aware
alternatives and approximating expensive operations, such as SiLU activation
and exponentiation, considering the target applications. Then, it performs an
approximation-aware neural architecture search (NAS) to tune the learnable
parameters used during approximation. Evaluations with Fashion-MNIST, CIFAR-10,
and MARS, an open-source human pose estimation dataset, show eMamba achieves
comparable accuracy to state-of-the-art techniques using 1.63-19.9$\times$
fewer parameters. In addition, it generalizes well to large-scale natural
language tasks, demonstrating stable perplexity across varying sequence lengths
on the WikiText2 dataset. We also quantize and implement the entire eMamba
pipeline on an AMD ZCU102 FPGA and ASIC using GlobalFoundries (GF) 22 nm
technology. Experimental results show 4.95-5.62$\times$ lower latency and
2.22-9.95$\times$ higher throughput, with 4.77$\times$ smaller area,
9.84$\times$ lower power, and 48.6$\times$ lower energy consumption than
baseline solutions while maintaining competitive accuracy.

Motivation: 现有ITL方法缺乏评估其是否真正捕捉标注者行为模式的统一框架，因此需要填补这一空白。

Method: 提出了两个新指标：DIC（量化模型捕捉标注者倾向的能力）和BAE（评估模型解释与标注者行为的一致性）。

Result: 实验验证了所提评估框架的有效性。

Conclusion: 该框架为ITL方法提供了可靠的评估工具，有助于理解标注者行为。

Abstract: Recent works have emerged in multi-annotator learning that shift focus from
Consensus-oriented Learning (CoL), which aggregates multiple annotations into a
single ground-truth prediction, to Individual Tendency Learning (ITL), which
models annotator-specific labeling behavior patterns (i.e., tendency) to
provide explanation analysis for understanding annotator decisions. However, no
evaluation framework currently exists to assess whether ITL methods truly
capture individual tendencies and provide meaningful behavioral explanations.
To address this gap, we propose the first unified evaluation framework with two
novel metrics: (1) Difference of Inter-annotator Consistency (DIC) quantifies
how well models capture annotator tendencies by comparing predicted
inter-annotator similarity structures with ground-truth; (2) Behavior Alignment
Explainability (BAE) evaluates how well model explanations reflect annotator
behavior and decision relevance by aligning explainability-derived with
ground-truth labeling similarity structures via Multidimensional Scaling (MDS).
Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our proposed evaluation
framework.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM推理因内存占用和带宽需求大而效率低下，计算能力增长快于内存能力，需要新算法平衡计算与内存操作。

Method: XQuant量化并缓存层输入激活X，动态重计算KV，减少内存；XQuant-CL利用X跨层相似性进一步压缩。

Result: XQuant节省7.7倍内存，困惑度损失<0.1；XQuant-CL节省10-12.5倍内存，困惑度损失0.01-0.1。

Conclusion: XQuant利用硬件计算能力消除内存瓶颈，超越现有KV缓存量化方法，接近FP16精度。

Abstract: Although LLM inference has emerged as a critical workload for many downstream
applications, efficiently inferring LLMs is challenging due to the substantial
memory footprint and bandwidth requirements. In parallel, compute capabilities
have steadily outpaced both memory capacity and bandwidth over the last few
decades, a trend that remains evident in modern GPU hardware and exacerbates
the challenge of LLM inference. As such, new algorithms are emerging that trade
increased computation for reduced memory operations. To that end, we present
XQuant, which takes advantage of this trend, enabling an order-of-magnitude
reduction in memory consumption through low-bit quantization with substantial
accuracy benefits relative to state-of-the-art KV cache quantization methods.
We accomplish this by quantizing and caching the layer input activations X,
instead of using standard KV caching, and then rematerializing the Keys and
Values on-the-fly during inference. This results in an immediate 2$\times$
memory savings compared to KV caching. By applying XQuant, we achieve up to
$\sim 7.7\times$ memory savings with $<0.1$ perplexity degradation compared to
the FP16 baseline. Furthermore, our approach leverages the fact that X values
are similar across layers. Building on this observation, we introduce
XQuant-CL, which exploits the cross-layer similarity in the X embeddings for
extreme compression. Across different models, XQuant-CL attains up to
10$\times$ memory savings relative to the FP16 baseline with only 0.01
perplexity degradation, and 12.5$\times$ memory savings with only $0.1$
perplexity degradation. XQuant exploits the rapidly increasing compute
capabilities of hardware platforms to eliminate the memory bottleneck, while
surpassing state-of-the-art KV cache quantization methods and achieving
near-FP16 accuracy across a wide range of models.

SC2Arena, a benchmark that fully supports all playable races, low-level action
spaces, and optimizes text-based observations to tackle spatial reasoning
challenges. Complementing this, we introduce StarEvolve, a hierarchical
framework that integrates strategic planning with tactical execution, featuring
iterative self-correction and continuous improvement via fine-tuning on
high-quality gameplay data. Its key components include a
Planner-Executor-Verifier structure to break down gameplay, and a scoring
system for selecting high-quality training samples. Comprehensive analysis
using SC2Arena provides valuable insights into developing generalist agents
that were not possible with previous benchmarks. Experimental results also

Conclusion: DAS是一种简单有效的方法，能够显式模拟SAM的隐式正则化行为，并在多个任务中验证了其优越性。

Abstract: Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM) has been proven to be an effective
optimization technique for improving generalization in overparameterized
models. While prior works have explored the implicit regularization of SAM in
simple two-core scale-invariant settings, its behavior in more general
tensorized or scale-invariant models remains underexplored. In this work, we
leverage scale-invariance to analyze the norm dynamics of SAM in general
tensorized models. We introduce the notion of \emph{Norm Deviation} as a global
measure of core norm imbalance, and derive its evolution under SAM using
gradient flow analysis. We show that SAM's implicit control of Norm Deviation
is governed by the covariance between core norms and their gradient magnitudes.
Motivated by these findings, we propose a simple yet effective method,
\emph{Deviation-Aware Scaling (DAS)}, which explicitly mimics this
regularization behavior by scaling core norms in a data-adaptive manner. Our
experiments across tensor completion, noisy training, model compression, and
parameter-efficient fine-tuning confirm that DAS achieves competitive or
improved performance over SAM, while offering reduced computational overhead.

TL;DR: RealAC是一个领域无关的框架，用于生成现实且可操作的反事实解释，通过自动保留特征间的复杂依赖关系并支持用户自定义约束。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常依赖手工约束或领域知识，难以捕捉数据中的复杂非线性关系，且缺乏对用户偏好的支持，导致反事实解释不现实或不可行。

Method: RealAC通过对齐事实和反事实实例的特征联合分布来保留特征依赖关系，并允许用户冻结不希望更改的属性。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上，RealAC在因果性、依赖保留和现实性指标上优于现有方法，包括基于大语言模型的技术。

Conclusion: RealAC提供了一种因果感知和用户中心的反事实生成解决方案，平衡了现实性和可操作性。

Abstract: Counterfactual explanations provide human-understandable reasoning for
AI-made decisions by describing minimal changes to input features that would
alter a model's prediction. To be truly useful in practice, such explanations
must be realistic and feasible -- they should respect both the underlying data
distribution and user-defined feasibility constraints. Existing approaches
often enforce inter-feature dependencies through rigid, hand-crafted
constraints or domain-specific knowledge, which limits their generalizability
and ability to capture complex, nonlinear relations inherent in data. Moreover,
they rarely accommodate user-specified preferences and suggest explanations
that are causally implausible or infeasible to act upon. We introduce RealAC, a
domain-agnostic framework for generating realistic and actionable
counterfactuals. RealAC automatically preserves complex inter-feature
dependencies without relying on explicit domain knowledge -- by aligning the
joint distributions of feature pairs between factual and counterfactual
instances. The framework also allows end-users to ``freeze'' attributes they
cannot or do not wish to change by suppressing change in frozen features during
optimization. Evaluations on three synthetic and two real datasets demonstrate
that RealAC balances realism with actionability. Our method outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines and Large Language Model-based counterfactual
generation techniques in causal edge score, dependency preservation score, and
IM1 realism metric and offers a solution for causality-aware and user-centric
counterfactual generation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GNN在医疗等高风险应用中缺乏透明性，现有解释方法多为全局性，无法提供局部节点决策的深入洞察。

Method: X-Node为每个节点构建结构化上下文向量，通过轻量级Reasoner模块生成解释向量，并利用解码器、预训练LLM和文本注入机制实现解释功能。

Result: 在MedMNIST和MorphoMNIST数据集上，X-Node在保持分类准确性的同时，生成了忠实于节点的解释。

Conclusion: X-Node为GNN提供了可解释性解决方案，适用于需要透明决策的高风险应用。

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) have achieved state-of-the-art results in
computer vision and medical image classification tasks by capturing structural
dependencies across data instances. However, their decision-making remains
largely opaque, limiting their trustworthiness in high-stakes clinical
applications where interpretability is essential. Existing explainability
techniques for GNNs are typically post-hoc and global, offering limited insight
into individual node decisions or local reasoning. We introduce X-Node, a
self-explaining GNN framework in which each node generates its own explanation
as part of the prediction process. For every node, we construct a structured
context vector encoding interpretable cues such as degree, centrality,
clustering, feature saliency, and label agreement within its local topology. A
lightweight Reasoner module maps this context into a compact explanation
vector, which serves three purposes: (1) reconstructing the node's latent
embedding via a decoder to enforce faithfulness, (2) generating a natural
language explanation using a pre-trained LLM (e.g., Grok or Gemini), and (3)
guiding the GNN itself via a "text-injection" mechanism that feeds explanations

*Xinrui Li,Qilin Fan,Tianfu Wang,Kaiwen Wei,Ke Yu,Xu Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GraphFedMIG是一个联邦图学习框架，通过生成对抗网络解决数据分布不均和类别不平衡问题，提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦图学习中非独立同分布数据和类别不平衡问题严重影响模型性能，尤其是少数类别的识别能力。

Method: 提出GraphFedMIG框架，采用分层生成对抗网络，通过互信息引导机制优化生成器参数，专注于生成高价值的少数类别特征。

Result: 在四个真实数据集上的实验表明，GraphFedMIG优于其他基线方法。

Conclusion: GraphFedMIG有效解决了联邦图学习中的类别不平衡问题，提升了模型对少数类别的识别能力。

Abstract: Federated graph learning (FGL) enables multiple clients to collaboratively
train powerful graph neural networks without sharing their private,
decentralized graph data. Inherited from generic federated learning, FGL is
critically challenged by statistical heterogeneity, where non-IID data
distributions across clients can severely impair model performance. A
particularly destructive form of this is class imbalance, which causes the
global model to become biased towards majority classes and fail at identifying
rare but critical events. This issue is exacerbated in FGL, as nodes from a
minority class are often surrounded by biased neighborhood information,
hindering the learning of expressive embeddings. To grapple with this
challenge, we propose GraphFedMIG, a novel FGL framework that reframes the
problem as a federated generative data augmentation task. GraphFedMIG employs a
hierarchical generative adversarial network where each client trains a local
generator to synthesize high-fidelity feature representations. To provide
tailored supervision, clients are grouped into clusters, each sharing a
dedicated discriminator. Crucially, the framework designs a mutual
information-guided mechanism to steer the evolution of these client generators.
By calculating each client's unique informational value, this mechanism
corrects the local generator parameters, ensuring that subsequent rounds of
mutual information-guided generation are focused on producing high-value,
minority-class features. We conduct extensive experiments on four real-world
datasets, and the results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed
GraphFedMIG compared with other baselines.

*Lisa Haxel,Jaivardhan Kapoor,Ulf Ziemann,Jakob H. Macke*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: EDAPT框架通过持续模型适应消除脑机接口（BCI）的校准需求，结合群体预训练和在线微调，显著提升解码精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决脑机接口因神经信号漂移和用户差异导致的精度下降问题，减少频繁校准的需求。

Method: EDAPT框架先通过多用户数据训练基线解码器，再通过监督微调持续个性化模型。

Result: 在三个BCI任务的九个数据集中，EDAPT显著优于静态方法，且运行高效。

Conclusion: EDAPT为无校准BCI提供了实用路径，降低了部署障碍。

Abstract: Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) suffer from accuracy degradation as neural
signals drift over time and vary across users, requiring frequent recalibration
that limits practical deployment. We introduce EDAPT, a task- and
model-agnostic framework that eliminates calibration through continual model
adaptation. EDAPT first trains a baseline decoder using data from multiple
users, then continually personalizes this model via supervised finetuning as
the neural patterns evolve during use. We tested EDAPT across nine datasets
covering three BCI tasks, and found that it consistently improved accuracy over
conventional, static methods. These improvements primarily stem from combining
population-level pretraining and online continual finetuning, with unsupervised
domain adaptation providing further gains on some datasets. EDAPT runs
efficiently, updating models within 200 milliseconds on consumer-grade
hardware. Finally, decoding accuracy scales with total data budget rather than
its allocation between subjects and trials. EDAPT provides a practical pathway
toward calibration-free BCIs, reducing a major barrier to BCI deployment.

<details>

Motivation: 未观测的混杂因素会导致因果效应估计偏差，影响观察性研究的可靠性。推荐系统虽依赖完全观测数据，但某些实践可能忽略特征，导致类似问题。

Method: 通过模拟研究展示常见实践如何引入混杂因素，并提供实际案例。

Result: 研究发现特征工程、A/B测试和模块化等实践可能引入混杂因素，降低推荐系统性能。

Conclusion: 论文建议实践中采取措施减少或避免混杂因素，以提高推荐系统的可靠性和性能。

Abstract: Unobserved confounding arises when an unmeasured feature influences both the
treatment and the outcome, leading to biased causal effect estimates. This
issue undermines observational studies in fields like economics, medicine,
ecology or epidemiology. Recommender systems leveraging fully observed data
seem not to be vulnerable to this problem. However many standard practices in
recommender systems result in observed features being ignored, resulting in
effectively the same problem. This paper will show that numerous common
practices such as feature engineering, A/B testing and modularization can in
fact introduce confounding into recommendation systems and hamper their
performance. Several illustrations of the phenomena are provided, supported by
simulation studies with practical suggestions about how practitioners may
reduce or avoid the affects of confounding in real systems.

Conclusion: Πnet在凸约束优化和非凸轨迹规划中表现出色，提供高效且鲁棒的解决方案。

Abstract: We introduce an output layer for neural networks that ensures satisfaction of
convex constraints. Our approach, $\Pi$net, leverages operator splitting for
rapid and reliable projections in the forward pass, and the implicit function
theorem for backpropagation. We deploy $\Pi$net as a feasible-by-design
optimization proxy for parametric constrained optimization problems and obtain
modest-accuracy solutions faster than traditional solvers when solving a single

state-of-the-art learning approaches in terms of training time, solution
quality, and robustness to hyperparameter tuning, while maintaining similar
inference times. Finally, we tackle multi-vehicle motion planning with
non-convex trajectory preferences and provide $\Pi$net as a GPU-ready package
implemented in JAX with effective tuning heuristics.

Result: 在简单摆系统上成功生成了结构化潜在状态空间模型，仅使用图像数据。

Conclusion: 该方法为开发更通用的控制算法和估计技术提供了新途径，尤其在机器人领域有广泛应用。

Abstract: With the advent of Joint Embedding Predictive Architectures (JEPAs), which
appear to be more capable than reconstruction-based methods, this paper
introduces a novel technique for creating world models using continuous-time
dynamic systems from arbitrary observation data. The proposed method integrates
sequence embeddings with neural ordinary differential equations (neural ODEs).
It employs loss functions that enforce contractive embeddings and Lipschitz
constants in state transitions to construct a well-organized latent state
space. The approach's effectiveness is demonstrated through the generation of
structured latent state-space models for a simple pendulum system using only
image data. This opens up a new technique for developing more general control
algorithms and estimation techniques with broad applications in robotics.

Motivation: ReLU网络在视觉数据中广泛使用，但其梯度解释存在噪声和难以解释的问题，现有方法（如GradCAM）通过牺牲忠实性来平滑解释。

Method: 引入了一种光谱框架，系统地分析和量化解释的平滑性与忠实性，并提出了正则化ReLU网络对高频信息贡献的方法。

Result: 理论分析揭示了代理平滑方法如何扭曲解释，并提出了“解释差距”的正式定义和测量方法。

Conclusion: 通过实验验证了理论发现，为解释方法的平滑性与忠实性权衡提供了原则性指导。

Abstract: ReLU networks, while prevalent for visual data, have sharp transitions,
sometimes relying on individual pixels for predictions, making vanilla
gradient-based explanations noisy and difficult to interpret. Existing methods,
such as GradCAM, smooth these explanations by producing surrogate models at the
cost of faithfulness. We introduce a unifying spectral framework to
systematically analyze and quantify smoothness, faithfulness, and their
trade-off in explanations. Using this framework, we quantify and regularize the
contribution of ReLU networks to high-frequency information, providing a
principled approach to identifying this trade-off. Our analysis characterizes
how surrogate-based smoothing distorts explanations, leading to an
``explanation gap'' that we formally define and measure for different post-hoc
methods. Finally, we validate our theoretical findings across different design
choices, datasets, and ablations.

Conclusion: 自动化编码本学习方法在多类分类任务中具有潜力，尤其在对抗攻击场景下表现优异。

Abstract: Although one-hot encoding is commonly used for multiclass classification, it
is not always the most effective encoding mechanism. Error Correcting Output
Codes (ECOC) address multiclass classification by mapping each class to a
unique codeword used as a label. Traditional ECOC methods rely on manually
designed or randomly generated codebooks, which are labor-intensive and may
yield suboptimal, dataset-agnostic results. This paper introduces three models
for automated codebook learning based on contrastive learning, allowing
codebooks to be learned directly and adaptively from data. Across four
datasets, our proposed models demonstrate superior robustness to adversarial
attacks compared to two baselines. The source is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有方法在灵活性和扩展性上的限制，整合自回归语言模型和扩散模型的优势。

Method: 采用两阶段设计（认知和决策），利用多角色LLM代理协作和增长感知搜索机制。

Result: 在多个基准测试中表现优于现有方法，包括超越GPT-4o。

Conclusion: MAGUS展示了无需联合训练即可实现高性能多模态任务的潜力。

Abstract: Real-world multimodal applications often require any-to-any capabilities,
enabling both understanding and generation across modalities including text,
image, audio, and video. However, integrating the strengths of autoregressive
language models (LLMs) for reasoning and diffusion models for high-fidelity
generation remains challenging. Existing approaches rely on rigid pipelines or
tightly coupled architectures, limiting flexibility and scalability. We propose
MAGUS (Multi-Agent Guided Unified Multimodal System), a modular framework that
unifies multimodal understanding and generation via two decoupled phases:
Cognition and Deliberation. MAGUS enables symbolic multi-agent collaboration
within a shared textual workspace. In the Cognition phase, three
role-conditioned multimodal LLM agents - Perceiver, Planner, and Reflector -
engage in collaborative dialogue to perform structured understanding and
planning. The Deliberation phase incorporates a Growth-Aware Search mechanism
that orchestrates LLM-based reasoning and diffusion-based generation in a
mutually reinforcing manner. MAGUS supports plug-and-play extensibility,
scalable any-to-any modality conversion, and semantic alignment - all without
the need for joint training. Experiments across multiple benchmarks, including
image, video, and audio generation, as well as cross-modal instruction
following, demonstrate that MAGUS outperforms strong baselines and
state-of-the-art systems. Notably, on the MME benchmark, MAGUS surpasses the
powerful closed-source model GPT-4o.

Conclusion: 深度强化学习可以显著提升NMC算法的性能，为复杂优化问题提供了更高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Optimizing or sampling complex cost functions of combinatorial optimization
problems is a longstanding challenge across disciplines and applications. When
employing family of conventional algorithms based on Markov Chain Monte Carlo
(MCMC) such as simulated annealing or parallel tempering, one assumes
homogeneous (equilibrium) temperature profiles across input. This instance
independent approach was shown to be ineffective for the hardest benchmarks
near a computational phase transition when the so-called overlap-gap-property
holds. In these regimes conventional MCMC struggles to unfreeze rigid
variables, escape suboptimal basins of attraction, and sample high-quality and
diverse solutions. In order to mitigate these challenges, Nonequilibrium
Nonlocal Monte Carlo (NMC) algorithms were proposed that leverage inhomogeneous
temperature profiles thereby accelerating exploration of the configuration
space without compromising its exploitation. Here, we employ deep reinforcement
learning (RL) to train the nonlocal transition policies of NMC which were
previously designed phenomenologically. We demonstrate that the resulting
solver can be trained solely by observing energy changes of the configuration
space exploration as RL rewards and the local minimum energy landscape geometry
as RL states. We further show that the trained policies improve upon the
standard MCMC-based and nonlocal simulated annealing on hard uniform random and
scale-free random 4-SAT benchmarks in terms of residual energy,
time-to-solution, and diversity of solutions metrics.

Result: 实验表明，PCD在图像对生成、物体操纵和多机器人运动规划中有效，提高了耦合效果并保证约束满足。

Conclusion: PCD提供了一种高效且无需重新训练的方法，适用于多扩散模型的联合生成任务。

Abstract: Modifications to test-time sampling have emerged as an important extension to
diffusion algorithms, with the goal of biasing the generative process to
achieve a given objective without having to retrain the entire diffusion model.
However, generating jointly correlated samples from multiple pre-trained
diffusion models while simultaneously enforcing task-specific constraints
without costly retraining has remained challenging. To this end, we propose
Projected Coupled Diffusion (PCD), a novel test-time framework for constrained
joint generation. PCD introduces a coupled guidance term into the generative
dynamics to encourage coordination between diffusion models and incorporates a
projection step at each diffusion step to enforce hard constraints.
Empirically, we demonstrate the effectiveness of PCD in application scenarios
of image-pair generation, object manipulation, and multi-robot motion planning.
Our results show improved coupling effects and guaranteed constraint
satisfaction without incurring excessive computational costs.

Abstract: Allergens, typically proteins capable of triggering adverse immune responses,
represent a significant public health challenge. To accurately identify
allergen proteins, we introduce Applm (Allergen Prediction with Protein
Language Models), a computational framework that leverages the 100-billion
parameter xTrimoPGLM protein language model. We show that Applm consistently
outperforms seven state-of-the-art methods in a diverse set of tasks that
closely resemble difficult real-world scenarios. These include identifying
novel allergens that lack similar examples in the training set, differentiating
between allergens and non-allergens among homologs with high sequence
similarity, and assessing functional consequences of mutations that create few
changes to the protein sequences. Our analysis confirms that xTrimoPGLM,
originally trained on one trillion tokens to capture general protein sequence
characteristics, is crucial for Applm's performance by detecting important
differences among protein sequences. In addition to providing Applm as
open-source software, we also provide our carefully curated benchmark datasets
to facilitate future research.

Motivation: 解决长期强化学习任务中奖励稀疏性问题，避免即时奖励与长期目标不一致导致的策略退化。

Method: 提出SWE-oriented RL Framework，支持多轮交互和Docker执行，并引入G-RA方法，仅在长期奖励达到阈值时累积即时奖励。

Result: 实验显示，G-RA显著提高了任务完成率（47.6%→93.8%和22.0%→86.0%）和修改率（19.6%→23.8%和12.0%→42.0%）。

Conclusion: G-RA方法在长期强化学习中实现了平衡的奖励累积，为类似任务提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Reward sparsity in long-horizon reinforcement learning (RL) tasks remains a
significant challenge, while existing outcome-based reward shaping struggles to
define meaningful immediate rewards without introducing bias or requiring
explicit task decomposition. Alternatively, verification-based reward shaping
uses stepwise critics, but misalignment between immediate rewards and long-term
objectives can lead to reward hacking and suboptimal policies. In this work, we
address this problem in the context of software engineering (SWE) tasks, where
multi-turn reasoning and rule-based verification are critical. We introduce the
SWE-oriented RL Framework, a unified system supporting multi-turn interaction,
docker-based execution, and customizable reward functions. Additionally, we
propose Gated Reward Accumulation (G-RA), a novel method that accumulates
immediate rewards only when high-level (long-term) rewards meet a predefined
threshold, ensuring stable RL optimization. Experiments on SWE-bench Verified
and kBench demonstrate that G-RA leads to an increase in completion rates
(47.6\% \rightarrow 93.8\% and 22.0\% \rightarrow 86.0\%) and modification
rates (19.6\% \rightarrow 23.8\% and 12.0\% \rightarrow 42.0\%), while avoiding
policy degradation caused by reward misalignment. Our findings highlight the
importance of balanced reward accumulation in long-horizon RL and provide a
practical solution.

Abstract: Estimating treatment effects (TE) from observational data is a critical yet
complex task in many fields, from healthcare and economics to public policy.
While recent advances in machine learning and causal inference have produced
powerful estimation techniques, their adoption remains limited due to the need
for deep expertise in causal assumptions, adjustment strategies, and model
selection. In this paper, we introduce CATE-B, an open-source co-pilot system
that uses large language models (LLMs) within an agentic framework to guide
users through the end-to-end process of treatment effect estimation. CATE-B
assists in (i) constructing a structural causal model via causal discovery and
LLM-based edge orientation, (ii) identifying robust adjustment sets through a
novel Minimal Uncertainty Adjustment Set criterion, and (iii) selecting
appropriate regression methods tailored to the causal structure and dataset
characteristics. To encourage reproducibility and evaluation, we release a
suite of benchmark tasks spanning diverse domains and causal complexities. By
combining causal inference with intelligent, interactive assistance, CATE-B
lowers the barrier to rigorous causal analysis and lays the foundation for a
new class of benchmarks in automated treatment effect estimation.

Abstract: Deep learning models often struggle to maintain generalizability in medical
imaging, particularly under domain-fracture scenarios where distribution shifts
arise from varying imaging techniques, acquisition protocols, patient
populations, demographics, and equipment. In practice, each hospital may need
to train distinct models - differing in learning task, width, and depth - to
match local data. For example, one hospital may use Euclidean architectures
such as MLPs and CNNs for tabular or grid-like image data, while another may
require non-Euclidean architectures such as graph neural networks (GNNs) for
irregular data like brain connectomes. How to train such heterogeneous models
coherently across datasets, while enhancing each model's generalizability,
remains an open problem. We propose unified learning, a new paradigm that
encodes each model into a graph representation, enabling unification in a
shared graph learning space. A GNN then guides optimization of these unified
models. By decoupling parameters of individual models and controlling them
through a unified GNN (uGNN), our method supports parameter sharing and
knowledge transfer across varying architectures (MLPs, CNNs, GNNs) and
distributions, improving generalizability. Evaluations on MorphoMNIST and two
MedMNIST benchmarks - PneumoniaMNIST and BreastMNIST - show that unified
learning boosts performance when models are trained on unique distributions and
tested on mixed ones, demonstrating strong robustness to unseen data with large
distribution shifts. Code and benchmarks: https://github.com/basiralab/uGNN

Abstract: To bridge the temporal granularity gap in energy network design and operation
based on Energy System Models, resampling of time series is required. While
conventional upsampling methods are computationally efficient, they often
result in significant information loss or increased noise. Advanced models such
as time series generation models, Super-Resolution models and imputation models
show potential, but also face fundamental challenges. The goal of time series
generative models is to learn the distribution of the original data to generate
high-resolution series with similar statistical characteristics. This is not
entirely consistent with the definition of upsampling. Time series
Super-Resolution models or imputation models can degrade the accuracy of
upsampling because the input low-resolution time series are sparse and may have
insufficient context. Moreover, such models usually rely on supervised learning
paradigms. This presents a fundamental application paradox: their training
requires the high-resolution time series that is intrinsically absent in
upsampling application scenarios. To address the mentioned upsampling issue,
this paper introduces a new method utilizing Generative Adversarial
Transformers (GATs), which can be trained without access to any ground-truth
high-resolution data. Compared with conventional interpolation methods, the
introduced method can reduce the root mean square error (RMSE) of upsampling
tasks by 9%, and the accuracy of a model predictive control (MPC) application
scenario is improved by 13%.

Abstract: Graph Anomaly Detection (GAD) aims to identify nodes that deviate from the
majority within a graph, playing a crucial role in applications such as social
networks and e-commerce. Despite the current advancements in deep
learning-based GAD, existing approaches often suffer from high deployment costs
and poor scalability due to their complex and resource-intensive training
processes. Surprisingly, our empirical findings suggest that the training phase
of deep GAD methods, commonly perceived as crucial, may actually contribute
less to anomaly detection performance than expected. Inspired by this, we
propose FreeGAD, a novel training-free yet effective GAD method. Specifically,
it leverages an affinity-gated residual encoder to generate anomaly-aware

and anomalous guides, followed by calculating anomaly scores through
anchor-guided statistical deviations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
FreeGAD achieves superior anomaly detection performance, efficiency, and
scalability on multiple benchmark datasets from diverse domains, without any
training or iterative optimization.

Abstract: Understanding the behavior of deep networks is crucial to increase our
confidence in their results. Despite an extensive body of work for explaining
their predictions, researchers have faced reliability issues, which can be
attributed to insufficient formalism. In our research, we adopt novel
probabilistic and spectral perspectives to formally analyze explanation
methods. Our study reveals a pervasive spectral bias stemming from the use of
gradient, and sheds light on some common design choices that have been
discovered experimentally, in particular, the use of squared gradient and input
perturbation. We further characterize how the choice of perturbation
hyperparameters in explanation methods, such as SmoothGrad, can lead to
inconsistent explanations and introduce two remedies based on our proposed
formalism: (i) a mechanism to determine a standard perturbation scale, and (ii)
an aggregation method which we call SpectralLens. Finally, we substantiate our
theoretical results through quantitative evaluations.

privacy by keeping data on the client-side while sharing only the intermediate
output with a server. However, the distributed nature of SL introduces new
security challenges, necessitating a comprehensive exploration of potential

*Davide Guidobene,Lorenzo Benedetti,Diego Arapovic*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种通过方差减少技术提高多目标强化学习（MORL）样本效率的方法，解决了现有策略梯度方法（PGMs）样本效率低的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多目标强化学习（MORL）需要同时优化多个可能冲突的目标，但现有策略梯度方法样本效率低，限制了其在大规模状态-动作空间中的应用。

Method: 采用方差减少技术，降低策略梯度的样本复杂度，同时保持一般性假设。

Result: 提出的方法显著提高了样本效率，同时保留了策略梯度方法的可扩展性优势。

Conclusion: 方差减少技术是提高MORL中策略梯度方法样本效率的有效途径，适用于复杂决策场景。

Abstract: Multi-Objective Reinforcement Learning (MORL) is a generalization of
traditional Reinforcement Learning (RL) that aims to optimize multiple, often
conflicting objectives simultaneously rather than focusing on a single reward.
This approach is crucial in complex decision-making scenarios where agents must
balance trade-offs between various goals, such as maximizing performance while
minimizing costs. We consider the problem of MORL where the objectives are
combined using a non-linear scalarization function. Just like in standard RL,
policy gradient methods (PGMs) are amongst the most effective for handling
large and continuous state-action spaces in MORL. However, existing PGMs for
MORL suffer from high sample inefficiency, requiring large amounts of data to
be effective. Previous attempts to solve this problem rely on overly strict
assumptions, losing PGMs' benefits in scalability to large state-action spaces.
In this work, we address the issue of sample efficiency by implementing
variance-reduction techniques to reduce the sample complexity of policy
gradients while maintaining general assumptions.

Main category: cs.LG

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统数据划分方法忽视实例内在质量，需更稳健的验证方法。

Result: IRT揭示了数据异质性，平衡划分有助于理解偏差-方差权衡；高猜测参数实例显著降低模型性能。

Conclusion: IRT指导的数据划分能更有效地验证模型，提升性能理解。

Abstract: Robust validation of Machine Learning (ML) models is essential, but
traditional data partitioning approaches often ignore the intrinsic quality of
each instance. This study proposes the use of Item Response Theory (IRT)
parameters to characterize and guide the partitioning of datasets in the model
validation stage. The impact of IRT-informed partitioning strategies on the
performance of several ML models in four tabular datasets was evaluated. The
results obtained demonstrate that IRT reveals an inherent heterogeneity of the
instances and highlights the existence of informative subgroups of instances
within the same dataset. Based on IRT, balanced partitions were created that
consistently help to better understand the tradeoff between bias and variance
of the models. In addition, the guessing parameter proved to be a determining
factor: training with high-guessing instances can significantly impair model
performance and resulted in cases with accuracy below 50%, while other
partitions reached more than 70% in the same dataset.

Result: 新方法在ΔΔG预测和针对SARS-CoV-2的抗体优化中优于现有最先进的深度学习方法。

Conclusion: 通过结合序列和结构信息，新方法在预测ΔΔG时表现出更高的准确性和实用性。

Abstract: Predicting changes in binding free energy ($\Delta\Delta G$) is a vital task
in protein engineering and protein-protein interaction (PPI) engineering for
drug discovery. Previous works have observed a high correlation between
$\Delta\Delta G$ and entropy, using probabilities of biologically important
objects such as side chain angles and residue identities to estimate
$\Delta\Delta G$. However, estimating the full conformational distribution of a
protein complex is generally considered intractable. In this work, we propose a
new approach to $\Delta\Delta G$ prediction that avoids this issue by instead
leveraging energy-based models for estimating the probability of a complex's
conformation. Specifically, we novelly decompose $\Delta\Delta G$ into a
sequence-based component estimated by an inverse folding model and a
structure-based component estimated by an energy model. This decomposition is
made tractable by assuming equilibrium between the bound and unbound states,
allowing us to simplify the estimation of degeneracies associated with each
state. Unlike previous deep learning-based methods, our method incorporates an
energy-based physical inductive bias by connecting the often-used sequence
log-odds ratio-based approach to $\Delta\Delta G$ prediction with a new
$\Delta\Delta E$ term grounded in statistical mechanics. We demonstrate
superiority over existing state-of-the-art structure and sequence-based deep
learning methods in $\Delta\Delta G$ prediction and antibody optimization
against SARS-CoV-2.

Result: MCIB在不依赖捷径学习的情况下取得了最佳性能。

Conclusion: MCIB通过改进模态融合和消除捷径信号，显著提升了多模态讽刺检测的效果。

Abstract: Multimodal sarcasm detection is a complex task that requires distinguishing
subtle complementary signals across modalities while filtering out irrelevant
information. Many advanced methods rely on learning shortcuts from datasets
rather than extracting intended sarcasm-related features. However, our
experiments show that shortcut learning impairs the model's generalization in
real-world scenarios. Furthermore, we reveal the weaknesses of current modality
fusion strategies for multimodal sarcasm detection through systematic
experiments, highlighting the necessity of focusing on effective modality
fusion for complex emotion recognition. To address these challenges, we
construct MUStARD++$^{R}$ by removing shortcut signals from MUStARD++. Then, a
Multimodal Conditional Information Bottleneck (MCIB) model is introduced to
enable efficient multimodal fusion for sarcasm detection. Experimental results
show that the MCIB achieves the best performance without relying on shortcut
learning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有空间转录组聚类方法存在噪声敏感性高和空间邻居信息建模不足的问题，限制了细胞亚群识别的准确性。

Method: SPHENIC结合了不变拓扑特征和空间约束优化模块（SCDOM），通过增强邻居相似性和降低非邻居相似性，生成高质量的聚类友好嵌入。

Result: 在14个基准空间转录组切片上的实验表明，SPHENIC性能优于现有方法，提升幅度为3.31%-6.54%。

Conclusion: SPHENIC通过拓扑特征和空间优化，显著提升了空间转录组聚类的准确性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: By incorporating spatial location information, spatial-transcriptomics
clustering yields more comprehensive insights into cell subpopulation
identification. Despite recent progress, existing methods have at least two
limitations: (i) topological learning typically considers only representations
of individual cells or their interaction graphs; however, spatial
transcriptomic profiles are often noisy, making these approaches vulnerable to
low-quality topological signals, and (ii) insufficient modeling of spatial
neighborhood information leads to low-quality spatial embeddings. To address
these limitations, we propose SPHENIC, a novel Spatial Persistent Homology
Enhanced Neighborhood Integrative Clustering method. Specifically, SPHENIC
incorporates invariant topological features into the clustering network to
achieve stable representation learning. Additionally, to construct high-quality
spatial embeddings that reflect the true cellular distribution, we design the
Spatial Constraint and Distribution Optimization Module (SCDOM). This module
increases the similarity between a cell's embedding and those of its spatial
neighbors, decreases similarity with non-neighboring cells, and thereby
produces clustering-friendly spatial embeddings. Extensive experiments on 14
benchmark spatial transcriptomic slices demonstrate that SPHENIC achieves
superior performance on the spatial clustering task, outperforming existing
state-of-the-art methods by 3.31%-6.54% over the best alternative.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 土地覆盖变化对地球系统过程有重要影响，但目前预测能力不足，需要新方法提升预测精度。

Method: 将土地覆盖变化预测视为数据合成问题，利用生成式AI（扩散模型）进行训练和预测。

Result: 在12个大都市区的实验中，模型在分辨率≥0.7×0.7km²时的MAE低于基线（无变化假设），验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: 生成式模型能捕捉历史数据中的时空模式，未来可结合地球物理属性和驱动变量进一步优化。

Abstract: Land cover, both present and future, has a significant effect on several
important Earth system processes. For example, impervious surfaces heat up and
speed up surface water runoff and reduce groundwater infiltration, with
concomitant effects on regional hydrology and flood risk. While regional Earth
System models have increasing skill at forecasting hydrologic and atmospheric
processes at high resolution in future climate scenarios, our ability to
forecast land-use and land-cover change (LULC), a critical input to risk and
consequences assessment for these scenarios, has lagged behind. In this paper,
we propose a new paradigm exploiting Generative AI (GenAI) for land cover
change forecasting by framing LULC forecasting as a data synthesis problem
conditioned on historical and auxiliary data-sources. We discuss desirable
properties of generative models that fundament our research premise, and
demonstrate the feasibility of our methodology through experiments on
imperviousness forecasting using historical data covering the entire
conterminous United States. Specifically, we train a diffusion model for
decadal forecasting of imperviousness and compare its performance to a baseline
that assumes no change at all. Evaluation across 12 metropolitan areas for a
year held-out during training indicate that for average resolutions $\geq
0.7\times0.7km^2$ our model yields MAE lower than such a baseline. This finding
corroborates that such a generative model can capture spatiotemporal patterns
from historical data that are significant for projecting future change.
Finally, we discuss future research to incorporate auxiliary information on
physical properties about the Earth, as well as supporting simulation of
different scenarios by means of driver variables.

Abstract: We study the problem of learning a neural sampler to generate samples from
discrete state spaces where the target probability mass function
$\pi\propto\mathrm{e}^{-U}$ is known up to a normalizing constant, which is an
important task in fields such as statistical physics, machine learning,
combinatorial optimization, etc. To better address this challenging task when
the state space has a large cardinality and the distribution is multi-modal, we
propose $\textbf{M}$asked $\textbf{D}$iffusion $\textbf{N}$eural
$\textbf{S}$ampler ($\textbf{MDNS}$), a novel framework for training discrete
neural samplers by aligning two path measures through a family of learning
objectives, theoretically grounded in the stochastic optimal control of the
continuous-time Markov chains. We validate the efficiency and scalability of
MDNS through extensive experiments on various distributions with distinct
statistical properties, where MDNS learns to accurately sample from the target
distributions despite the extremely high problem dimensions and outperforms
other learning-based baselines by a large margin. A comprehensive study of
ablations and extensions is also provided to demonstrate the efficacy and
potential of the proposed framework.

TL;DR: REFN利用强化学习训练LLM自动生成网络过滤器，有效防御1天或N天漏洞攻击，具有高准确性、快速响应和强扩展性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有防御措施（如主机补丁和网络过滤）因扩展性、兼容性和部署问题无法有效应对1天或N天漏洞威胁。

Method: REFN通过强化学习驱动LLM生成网络过滤器，结合在线网络奖励、边缘安全网关部署和实时流量验证。

Result: 在22类漏洞攻击测试中，REFN准确率提高21.1%，平均补丁时间仅3.65小时，可扩展至1万台设备。

Conclusion: REFN为LLM在漏洞防御中的应用提供了初步解决方案，未来可进一步优化大规模部署。

Abstract: The exploitation of 1 day or n day vulnerabilities poses severe threats to
networked devices due to massive deployment scales and delayed patching
(average Mean Time To Patch exceeds 60 days). Existing defenses, including host
based patching and network based filtering, are inadequate due to limited
scalability across diverse devices, compatibility issues especially with
embedded or legacy systems, and error prone deployment process (manual patch
validation). To address these issues, we introduce REFN (Reinforcement Learning
From Network), a novel framework that trains Large Language Models (LLMs) to
autonomously generate network filters to prevent 1 day or n day exploitations.
REFN ensures scalability by uniquely employs Reinforcement Learning (RL) driven
by online network rewards instead of traditional Human Feedback (RLHF). REFN
guarantees compatibility via unified deployment on edge security gateways
(Amazon Eero). REFN provides robustness via online validation using real
network traffic. Crucially, REFN addresses three core challenges in training
LLMs for exploit prevention: 1) expanding current LLMs limited vulnerability
fixing expertise via Agentic RAG based Knowledge Distillation, 2) bridging
current LLMs language to network gaps through an RL From VNF Pipeline that
translates language context (vulnerability description) into network
enforcement, 3) addressing the LLM hallucination and non determinism via the
Online Agentic Validation that penalizes erroneous outputs. Evaluated across 22
families of 1 day or n day exploits, REFN demonstrates effectiveness (21.1
percent higher accuracy than alternatives), efficiency (Mean Time To Patch of
3.65 hours) and scalability (easily scale to 10K devices). REFN serves as an
initial step toward training LLMs to rapidly prevent massive scale 1 day or n
day exploitations.

Motivation: 机器学习方法虽能解决许多优化问题，但需要大量训练数据，而电磁仿真计算复杂度高，难以快速生成足够样本。

Method: 利用GPU加速开源电磁仿真软件（gprMax），生成大量天线仿真数据集，并比较不同机器学习模型的性能。

Result: 入门级GPU性能远超高端CPU，高端游戏GPU性能可达高端CPU的18倍；开源软件在足够精细的分辨率下与商业软件结果相似。

Conclusion: GPU加速的开源电磁仿真框架能高效生成数据集，为机器学习在天线设计中的应用提供支持。

Abstract: This study proposes an antenna simulation framework powered by graphics
processing units (GPUs) based on an open-source electromagnetic (EM) simulation
software (gprMax) for machine learning applications of antenna design and
optimization. Furthermore, it compares the simulation results with those
obtained through commercial EM software. The proposed software framework for
machine learning and surrogate model applications will produce antenna data
sets consisting of a large number of antenna simulation results using GPUs.
Although machine learning methods can attain the optimum solutions for many
problems, they are known to be data-hungry and require a great deal of samples
for the training stage of the algorithms. However, producing a sufficient
number of training samples in EM applications within a limited time is
challenging due to the high computational complexity of EM simulations.
Therefore, GPUs are utilized in this study to simulate a large number of
antennas with predefined or random antenna shape parameters to produce data
sets. Moreover, this study also compares various machine learning and deep
learning models in terms of antenna parameter estimation performance. This
study demonstrates that an entry-level GPU substantially outperforms a high-end
CPU in terms of computational performance, while a high-end gaming GPU can
achieve around 18 times more computational performance compared to a high-end
CPU. Moreover, it is shown that the open-source EM simulation software can
deliver similar results to those obtained via commercial software in the
simulation of microstrip antennas when the spatial resolution of the
simulations is sufficiently fine.

Conclusion: APFL通过双流设计有效解决了非独立同分布数据问题，显著提升了联邦学习的个性化效果。

Abstract: Personalized Federated Learning (PFL) has presented a significant challenge
to deliver personalized models to individual clients through collaborative
training. Existing PFL methods are often vulnerable to non-IID data, which
severely hinders collective generalization and then compromises the subsequent
personalization efforts. In this paper, to address this non-IID issue in PFL,
we propose an Analytic Personalized Federated Learning (APFL) approach via
dual-stream least squares. In our APFL, we use a foundation model as a frozen
backbone for feature extraction. Subsequent to the feature extractor, we
develop dual-stream analytic models to achieve both collective generalization
and individual personalization. Specifically, our APFL incorporates a shared
primary stream for global generalization across all clients, and a dedicated
refinement stream for local personalization of each individual client. The
analytical solutions of our APFL enable its ideal property of heterogeneity
invariance, theoretically meaning that each personalized model remains
identical regardless of how heterogeneous the data are distributed across all
other clients. Empirical results across various datasets also validate the
superiority of our APFL over state-of-the-art baselines, with advantages of at
least 1.10%-15.45% in accuracy.

Result: Pass@k Training提升了探索能力，探索与利用可以相互促进，优势函数设计显示出潜力。

Conclusion: Pass@k Training为RLVR提供了有效方法，优势函数设计是未来研究方向。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR), which typically adopts
Pass@1 as the reward, has faced the issues in balancing exploration and
exploitation, causing policies to prefer conservative actions, converging to a
local optimum. Identifying an appropriate reward metric is therefore crucial.
Regarding the prior work, although Pass@k has been used in evaluation, its
connection to LLM exploration ability in RLVR remains largely overlooked. To
investigate this, we first use Pass@k as the reward to train the policy model
(i.e., $\textbf{Pass@k Training}$), and observe the improvement on its
exploration ability. Next, we derive an analytical solution for the advantage
of Pass@k Training, leading to an efficient and effective process. Building on
this, our analysis reveals that exploration and exploitation are not inherently
conflicting objectives, while they can mutually enhance each other. Moreover,
Pass@k Training with analytical derivation essentially involves directly
designing the advantage function. Inspired by this, we preliminarily explore
the advantage design for RLVR, showing promising results and highlighting a
potential future direction.

Conclusion: IBEX在数据稀缺情况下显著提升了药物设计性能，具有更高的有效容量和迁移能力。

Abstract: Three-dimensional generative models increasingly drive structure-based drug
discovery, yet it remains constrained by the scarce publicly available
protein-ligand complexes. Under such data scarcity, almost all existing
pipelines struggle to learn transferable geometric priors and consequently
overfit to training-set biases. As such, we present IBEX, an
Information-Bottleneck-EXplored coarse-to-fine pipeline to tackle the chronic
shortage of protein-ligand complex data in structure-based drug design.
Specifically, we use PAC-Bayesian information-bottleneck theory to quantify the
information density of each sample. This analysis reveals how different masking
strategies affect generalization and indicates that, compared with conventional
de novo generation, the constrained Scaffold Hopping task endows the model with
greater effective capacity and improved transfer performance. IBEX retains the
original TargetDiff architecture and hyperparameters for training to generate
molecules compatible with the binding pocket; it then applies an L-BFGS
optimization step to finely refine each conformation by optimizing five
physics-based terms and adjusting six translational and rotational degrees of
freedom in under one second. With only these modifications, IBEX raises the
zero-shot docking success rate on CBGBench CrossDocked2020-based from 53% to
64%, improves the mean Vina score from $-7.41 kcal mol^{-1}$ to $-8.07 kcal
mol^{-1}$, and achieves the best median Vina energy in 57 of 100 pockets versus
3 for the original TargetDiff. IBEX also increases the QED by 25%, achieves
state-of-the-art validity and diversity, and markedly reduces extrapolation
error.

TL;DR: DECAF-GAD是一个解决图异常检测（GAD）中公平性问题的框架，通过解耦敏感属性和表示学习，同时保持检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有GAD方法忽视了公平性，GNN模型可能放大训练数据中的偏见，导致不公平结果。DECAF-GAD旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 提出基于结构因果模型（SCM）的解耦方法，设计专用自编码器架构和公平性损失函数。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上，DECAF-GAD在异常检测性能和公平性指标上均优于基线方法。

Conclusion: DECAF-GAD有效平衡了GAD性能和公平性，为公平GAD提供了新思路。

Abstract: Graph anomaly detection (GAD) has become an increasingly important task
across various domains. With the rapid development of graph neural networks
(GNNs), GAD methods have achieved significant performance improvements.
However, fairness considerations in GAD remain largely underexplored. Indeed,
GNN-based GAD models can inherit and amplify biases present in training data,
potentially leading to unfair outcomes. While existing efforts have focused on
developing fair GNNs, most approaches target node classification tasks, where
models often rely on simple layer architectures rather than autoencoder-based
structures, which are the most widely used architecturs for anomaly detection.
To address fairness in autoencoder-based GAD models, we propose
\textbf{D}is\textbf{E}ntangled \textbf{C}ounterfactual \textbf{A}dversarial
\textbf{F}air (DECAF)-GAD, a framework that alleviates bias while preserving
GAD performance. Specifically, we introduce a structural causal model (SCM) to
disentangle sensitive attributes from learned representations. Based on this
causal framework, we formulate a specialized autoencoder architecture along
with a fairness-guided loss function. Through extensive experiments on both
synthetic and real-world datasets, we demonstrate that DECAF-GAD not only
achieves competitive anomaly detection performance but also significantly
enhances fairness metrics compared to baseline GAD methods. Our code is
available at https://github.com/Tlhey/decaf_code.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实应用中（如医疗和推荐系统），传统RMAB算法假设的平稳性常被打破，需解决非平稳动态问题。

Method: 提出RMAB算法，结合滑动窗口强化学习和UCB机制，学习动态变化。

Result: 算法达到$\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(N^2 B^{\frac{1}{4}} T^{\frac{3}{4}})$的遗憾界。

Conclusion: 首次为非平稳RMAB问题提供了理论框架，算法具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Online restless multi-armed bandits (RMABs) typically assume that each arm
follows a stationary Markov Decision Process (MDP) with fixed state transitions
and rewards. However, in real-world applications like healthcare and
recommendation systems, these assumptions often break due to non-stationary
dynamics, posing significant challenges for traditional RMAB algorithms. In
this work, we specifically consider $N$-armd RMAB with non-stationary
transition constrained by bounded variation budgets $B$. Our proposed \rmab\;
algorithm integrates sliding window reinforcement learning (RL) with an upper
confidence bound (UCB) mechanism to simultaneously learn transition dynamics
and their variations. We further establish that \rmab\; achieves
$\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(N^2 B^{\frac{1}{4}} T^{\frac{3}{4}})$ regret bound by
leveraging a relaxed definition of regret, providing a foundational theoretical
framework for non-stationary RMAB problems for the first time.

Motivation: 高斯过程在回归和系统识别中广泛应用，但其计算复杂度限制了其在小数据集上的适用性，尤其是在流式数据场景下。在线GPs通过定义最大数据点预算和移除冗余数据点来缓解这一问题。

Method: 论文比较了多种缩减标准，分析了它们的计算复杂性和缩减行为，并在基准函数和真实数据集（包括动态系统识别任务）上进行了评估。此外，还提出了接受标准以进一步过滤冗余数据点。

Result: 研究结果为在线GP算法选择合适标准提供了实用指南。

Conclusion: 该工作为在线GPs的高效实现提供了理论和实践支持，特别是在处理流式数据时。

Abstract: Gaussian Processes (GPs) are widely used for regression and system
identification due to their flexibility and ability to quantify uncertainty.
However, their computational complexity limits their applicability to small
datasets. Moreover in a streaming scenario, more and more datapoints accumulate
which is intractable even for Sparse GPs. Online GPs aim to alleviate this
problem by e.g. defining a maximum budget of datapoints and removing redundant
datapoints. This work provides a unified comparison of several reduction
criteria, analyzing both their computational complexity and reduction behavior.
The criteria are evaluated on benchmark functions and real-world datasets,
including dynamic system identification tasks. Additionally, acceptance
criteria are proposed to further filter out redundant datapoints. This work
yields practical guidelines for choosing a suitable criterion for an online GP
algorithm.

Result: 揭示了从静态缓存向自适应学习系统的转变，并提出了分层缓冲和惊喜门控更新等解决方案。

Conclusion: 为构建受认知启发的终身学习Transformer架构提供了路线图。

Abstract: Memory is fundamental to intelligence, enabling learning, reasoning, and
adaptability across biological and artificial systems. While Transformer
architectures excel at sequence modeling, they face critical limitations in
long-range context retention, continual learning, and knowledge integration.
This review presents a unified framework bridging neuroscience principles,
including dynamic multi-timescale memory, selective attention, and
consolidation, with engineering advances in Memory-Augmented Transformers. We
organize recent progress through three taxonomic dimensions: functional
objectives (context extension, reasoning, knowledge integration, adaptation),
memory representations (parameter-encoded, state-based, explicit, hybrid), and
integration mechanisms (attention fusion, gated control, associative
retrieval). Our analysis of core memory operations (reading, writing,
forgetting, and capacity management) reveals a shift from static caches toward
adaptive, test-time learning systems. We identify persistent challenges in
scalability and interference, alongside emerging solutions including
hierarchical buffering and surprise-gated updates. This synthesis provides a
roadmap toward cognitively-inspired, lifelong-learning Transformer
architectures.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 数据最小化是GDPR等法规的核心原则，但在机器学习中缺乏统一的研究框架，导致实践者难以理解和应用。

Method: 通过引入一个包含统一数据管道、对手模型和最小化点的框架，系统性地综述了相关文献。

Result: 提出了首个结构化概述，帮助实践者和研究者更有效地应用数据最小化原则。

Conclusion: 该框架促进了数据最小化在AI/ML中的统一理解和广泛应用。

Abstract: Data minimization (DM) describes the principle of collecting only the data
strictly necessary for a given task. It is a foundational principle across
major data protection regulations like GDPR and CPRA. Violations of this
principle have substantial real-world consequences, with regulatory actions
resulting in fines reaching hundreds of millions of dollars. Notably, the
relevance of data minimization is particularly pronounced in machine learning
(ML) applications, which typically rely on large datasets, resulting in an
emerging research area known as Data Minimization in Machine Learning (DMML).
At the same time, existing work on other ML privacy and security topics often
addresses concerns relevant to DMML without explicitly acknowledging the
connection. This disconnect leads to confusion among practitioners,
complicating their efforts to implement DM principles and interpret the
terminology, metrics, and evaluation criteria used across different research
communities. To address this gap, our work introduces a comprehensive framework
for DMML, including a unified data pipeline, adversaries, and points of
minimization. This framework allows us to systematically review the literature
on data minimization and \emph{DM-adjacent} methodologies, for the first time
presenting a structured overview designed to help practitioners and researchers
effectively apply DM principles. Our work facilitates a unified DM-centric
understanding and broader adoption of data minimization strategies in AI/ML.

Method: 提出交互式验证协议，由强大的证明者计算归因结果，资源受限的验证者通过交互验证其准确性，协议提供PAC验证保证。

Result: 协议确保验证者能以O(1/ε)的计算量接受接近最优的归因结果，且能检测证明者的偏离行为。

Conclusion: 该方法为数据归因提供了高效且可信的验证方案，适用于广泛的归因任务。

Abstract: Data attribution methods aim to answer useful counterfactual questions like
"what would a ML model's prediction be if it were trained on a different
dataset?" However, estimation of data attribution models through techniques
like empirical influence or "datamodeling" remains very computationally
expensive. This causes a critical trust issue: if only a few computationally
rich parties can obtain data attributions, how can resource-constrained parties
trust that the provided attributions are indeed "good," especially when they
are used for important downstream applications (e.g., data pricing)? In this
paper, we address this trust issue by proposing an interactive verification
paradigm for data attribution. An untrusted and computationally powerful Prover
learns data attributions, and then engages in an interactive proof with a
resource-constrained Verifier. Our main result is a protocol that provides
formal completeness, soundness, and efficiency guarantees in the sense of
Probably-Approximately-Correct (PAC) verification. Specifically, if both Prover
and Verifier follow the protocol, the Verifier accepts data attributions that
are {\epsilon}-close to the optimal data attributions (in terms of the Mean
Squared Error) with probability 1-{\delta}. Conversely, if the Prover
arbitrarily deviates from the protocol, even with infinite compute, then this
is detected (or it still yields data attributions to the Verifier) except with
probability {\delta}. Importantly, our protocol ensures the Verifier's
workload, measured by the number of independent model retrainings it must
perform, scales only as O(1/{\epsilon}); i.e., independently of the dataset
size. At a technical level, our results apply to efficiently verifying any
linear function over the boolean hypercube computed by the Prover, making them
broadly applicable to various attribution tasks.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI驱动的药物设计缺乏实验先验知识，可能导致设计出的分子违反隐含约束（如致突变性）。

Method: 构建了一个包含3230万对自然语言事实和实体表示的数据集，并训练了LLM、CLIP和LLava架构来联合推理文本和设计目标。

Result: 使用该数据集预训练的模型在TDC任务中表现优于更大的模型，并在GuacaMol中生成更安全的分子。

Conclusion: \ourdataset能有效提升模型的先验知识，为药物设计提供更安全的优化约束。

Abstract: AI-driven discovery can greatly reduce design time and enhance new
therapeutics' effectiveness. Models using simulators explore broad design
spaces but risk violating implicit constraints due to a lack of experimental
priors. For example, in a new analysis we performed on a diverse set of models
on the GuacaMol benchmark using supervised classifiers, over 60\% of molecules
proposed had high probability of being mutagenic. In this work, we introduce
\ourdataset, a dataset of priors for design problems extracted from literature
describing compounds used in lab settings. It is constructed with LLM pipelines
for discovering therapeutic entities in relevant paragraphs and summarizing
information in concise fair-use facts. \ourdataset~ consists of 32.3 million
pairs of natural language facts, and appropriate entity representations (i.e.
SMILES or refseq IDs). To demonstrate the potential of the data, we train LLM,
CLIP, and LLava architectures to reason jointly about text and design targets
and evaluate on tasks from the Therapeutic Data Commons (TDC). \ourdataset~is
highly effective for creating models with strong priors: in supervised
prediction problems that use our data as pretraining, our best models with 15M
learnable parameters outperform larger 2B TxGemma on both regression and
classification TDC tasks, and perform comparably to 9B models on average.
Models built with \ourdataset~can be used as constraints while optimizing for
novel molecules in GuacaMol, resulting in proposals that are safer and nearly
as effective. We release our dataset at
\href{https://huggingface.co/datasets/medexanon/Medex}{huggingface.co/datasets/medexanon/Medex},
and will provide expanded versions as available literature grows.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于生成模型的硬件设计空间探索方法，显著提升了效率和准确性，适用于大规模复杂设计空间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI模型复杂度增加，传统设计空间探索方法效率低下且难以应对大规模非凸、非双射的设计空间。

Method: 将硬件设计建模为1-D图像合成，通过生成模型学习硬件性能映射，实现高效优化。

Result: 相比传统方法，生成误差降低0.86%，速度提升17000倍；在结构化DSE中，能耗延迟积降低9.8%，性能提升6%。

Conclusion: 该方法在大规模设计空间中表现出显著优势，为AI硬件加速提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Design space exploration (DSE) is critical for developing optimized hardware
architectures, especially for AI workloads such as deep neural networks (DNNs)
and large language models (LLMs), which require specialized acceleration. As
model complexity grows, accelerator design spaces have expanded to O(10^17),
becoming highly irregular, non-convex, and exhibiting many-to-one mappings from
design configurations to performance metrics. This complexity renders direct
inverse derivation infeasible and necessitates heuristic or sampling-based
optimization. Conventional methods - including Bayesian optimization, gradient
descent, reinforcement learning, and genetic algorithms - depend on iterative
sampling, resulting in long runtimes and sensitivity to initialization. Deep
learning-based approaches have reframed DSE as classification using
recommendation models, but remain limited to small-scale (O(10^3)), less
complex design spaces. To overcome these constraints, we propose a generative
approach that models hardware design as 1-D image synthesis conditioned on
target performance, enabling efficient learning of non-differentiable,
non-bijective hardware-performance mappings. Our framework achieves 0.86% lower
generation error than Bayesian optimization with a 17000x speedup, and
outperforms GANDSE with 30% lower error at only 1.83x slower search. We further
extend the method to a structured DSE setting, attaining 9.8% lower
energy-delay product (EDP) and 6% higher performance, with up to 145.6x and
1312x faster search compared to existing optimization methods on O(10^17)
design spaces. For LLM inference, our method achieves 3.37x and 7.75x lower EDP
on a 32nm ASIC and Xilinx Ultrascale+ VPU13 FPGA, respectively, compared to the
state-of-the-art DOSA framework.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose AnalogSeeker, an effort toward an open-source
foundation language model for analog circuit design, with the aim of
integrating domain knowledge and giving design assistance. To overcome the
scarcity of data in this field, we employ a corpus collection strategy based on
the domain knowledge framework of analog circuits. High-quality, accessible
textbooks across relevant subfields are systematically curated and cleaned into
a textual domain corpus. To address the complexity of knowledge of analog
circuits, we introduce a granular domain knowledge distillation method. Raw,
unlabeled domain corpus is decomposed into typical, granular learning nodes,
where a multi-agent framework distills implicit knowledge embedded in
unstructured text into question-answer data pairs with detailed reasoning
processes, yielding a fine-grained, learnable dataset for fine-tuning. To
address the unexplored challenges in training analog circuit foundation models,
we explore and share our training methods through both theoretical analysis and
experimental validation. We finally establish a fine-tuning-centric training
paradigm, customizing and implementing a neighborhood self-constrained
supervised fine-tuning algorithm. This approach enhances training outcomes by
constraining the perturbation magnitude between the model's output
distributions before and after training. In practice, we train the
Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct model to obtain AnalogSeeker, which achieves 85.04%
accuracy on AMSBench-TQA, the analog circuit knowledge evaluation benchmark,
with a 15.67% point improvement over the original model and is competitive with
mainstream commercial models. Furthermore, AnalogSeeker also shows
effectiveness in the downstream operational amplifier design task. AnalogSeeker
is open-sourced at https://huggingface.co/analogllm/analogseeker for research

Motivation: 异构芯片PIM架构在AI推理中具有潜力，但调度工作负载面临性能、能耗和热约束的挑战。

Method: 提出THERMOS框架，使用多目标强化学习（MORL）策略，动态优化执行时间、能耗或平衡目标。

Result: THERMOS比基线算法平均执行时间快89%，能耗降低57%，运行时和能耗开销极低。

Conclusion: THERMOS为异构PIM架构提供了一种高效、灵活的AI工作负载调度解决方案。

Abstract: Chiplet-based integration enables large-scale systems that combine diverse
technologies, enabling higher yield, lower costs, and scalability, making them
well-suited to AI workloads. Processing-in-Memory (PIM) has emerged as a
promising solution for AI inference, leveraging technologies such as ReRAM,
SRAM, and FeFET, each offering unique advantages and trade-offs. A
heterogeneous chiplet-based PIM architecture can harness the complementary
strengths of these technologies to enable higher performance and energy
efficiency. However, scheduling AI workloads across such a heterogeneous system
is challenging due to competing performance objectives, dynamic workload
characteristics, and power and thermal constraints. To address this need, we
propose THERMOS, a thermally-aware, multi-objective scheduling framework for AI
workloads on heterogeneous multi-chiplet PIM architectures. THERMOS trains a
single multi-objective reinforcement learning (MORL) policy that is capable of
achieving Pareto-optimal execution time, energy, or a balanced objective at
runtime, depending on the target preferences. Comprehensive evaluations show
that THERMOS achieves up to 89% faster average execution time and 57% lower
average energy consumption than baseline AI workload scheduling algorithms with
only 0.14% runtime and 0.022% energy overhead.
