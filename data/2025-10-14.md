*Yuguang Liu,Yiyun Miao,Luyao Xia*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出DRGrad框架解决多任务学习中的负迁移和跷跷板现象，通过路由器、更新器和个性化门网络来管理任务冲突，在150亿样本的真实推荐数据集上表现优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多任务学习在推荐系统中面临负迁移和跷跷板现象的挑战，由于任务间存在复杂且矛盾的相关性，需要有效管理任务冲突并利用个性化信息。

Method: 提出个性化直接路由梯度框架(DRGrad)，包含路由器、更新器和个性化门网络三个组件，在训练过程中判断任务间的利害关系，利用有效梯度减少冲突。

Result: 在150亿样本的真实推荐数据集上，DRGrad在AUC指标上优于现有最先进的多任务学习模型，同时在公共Census-income和合成数据集上也验证了其处理不同相关性和个性化程度任务的能力。

Conclusion: DRGrad能有效管理多任务学习环境中的任务冲突，不增加模型复杂度，同时解决了噪声处理方面的不足，在推荐系统中具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Multi-task learning (MTL) has emerged as a successful strategy in
industrial-scale recommender systems, offering significant advantages such as
capturing diverse users' interests and accurately detecting different behaviors
like ``click" or ``dwell time". However, negative transfer and the seesaw
phenomenon pose challenges to MTL models due to the complex and often
contradictory task correlations in real-world recommendations. To address the
problem while making better use of personalized information, we propose a
personalized Direct Routing Gradient framework (DRGrad), which consists of
three key components: router, updater and personalized gate network. DRGrad
judges the stakes between tasks in the training process, which can leverage all
valid gradients for the respective task to reduce conflicts. We evaluate the
efficiency of DRGrad on complex MTL using a real-world recommendation dataset
with 15 billion samples. The results show that DRGrad's superior performance
over competing state-of-the-art MTL models, especially in terms of AUC (Area
Under the Curve) metrics, indicating that it effectively manages task conflicts
in multi-task learning environments without increasing model complexity, while
also addressing the deficiencies in noise processing. Moreover, experiments on
the public Census-income dataset and Synthetic dataset, have demonstrated the
capability of DRGrad in judging and routing the stakes between tasks with
varying degrees of correlation and personalization.

*Shaharyar Alam Ansari,Mohammad Luqman,Aasim Zafar,Savir Ali*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出一个集成CCTV监控视频和多源数据的统一框架，通过时空特征融合、频繁序列模式挖掘和混合LSTM-Transformer模型，实现98.46%的高精度实时城市交通预测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 快速城市化加剧了交通拥堵和环境压力，传统静态信号系统无法适应现代交通的动态特性，迫切需要智能自适应交通管理解决方案。

Method: 结合时空特征融合、频繁序列模式挖掘(FEM)发现顺序交通模式，以及混合LSTM-Transformer模型进行鲁棒交通状态预测。

Result: 在CityFlowV2数据集(313,931个标注边界框，46个摄像头)上达到98.46%预测精度，宏精度0.9800，宏召回0.9839，宏F1分数0.9819。FEM分析显示置信度超55%的中度-拥堵转换模式，生成46个持续拥堵警报。

Conclusion: 强调将视频流分析与多源数据结合对于设计实时、响应式、自适应多级智能交通系统的必要性，使城市出行更智能安全。

Abstract: Rapid urbanization has intensified traffic congestion, environmental strain,
and inefficiencies in transportation systems, creating an urgent need for
intelligent and adaptive traffic management solutions. Conventional systems
relying on static signals and manual monitoring are inadequate for the dynamic
nature of modern traffic. This research aims to develop a unified framework
that integrates CCTV surveillance videos with multi-source data descriptors to
enhance real-time urban traffic prediction. The proposed methodology
incorporates spatio-temporal feature fusion, Frequent Episode Mining for
sequential traffic pattern discovery, and a hybrid LSTM-Transformer model for
robust traffic state forecasting. The framework was evaluated on the CityFlowV2
dataset comprising 313,931 annotated bounding boxes across 46 cameras. It
achieved a high prediction accuracy of 98.46 percent, with a macro precision of
0.9800, macro recall of 0.9839, and macro F1-score of 0.9819. FEM analysis
revealed significant sequential patterns such as moderate-congested transitions
with confidence levels exceeding 55 percent. The 46 sustained congestion alerts
are system-generated, which shows practical value for proactive congestion
management. This emphasizes the need for the incorporation of video stream
analytics with data from multiple sources for the design of real-time,
responsive, adaptable multi-level intelligent transportation systems, which
makes urban mobility smarter and safer.

### [3] [A Joint Learning Approach to Hardware Caching and Prefetching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10862)
*Samuel Yuan,Divyanshu Saxena,Jiayi Chen,Nihal Sharma,Aditya Akella*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出一种联合学习方法，通过共享表示来训练缓存替换和预取策略，解决单独训练策略在组合时性能不佳的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 单独训练的缓存策略在组合使用时可能达不到最优性能，因为缓存替换和预取策略存在双向依赖关系。

Method: 开发两种共享表示方法：基于联合编码器的方法和基于对比学习的嵌入方法。

Result: 两种方法都显示出有希望的初步结果。

Conclusion: 为未来研究制定了议程，强调联合学习的重要性。

Abstract: Several learned policies have been proposed to replace heuristics for
scheduling, caching, and other system components in modern systems. By
leveraging diverse features, learning from historical trends, and predicting
future behaviors, such models promise to keep pace with ever-increasing
workload dynamism and continuous hardware evolution. However, policies trained
in isolation may still achieve suboptimal performance when placed together. In
this paper, we inspect one such instance in the domain of hardware caching --
for the policies of cache replacement and prefetching. We argue that these two
policies are bidirectionally interdependent and make the case for training the
two jointly. We propose a joint learning approach based on developing shared
representations for the features used by the two policies. We present two
approaches to develop these shared representations, one based on a joint
encoder and another based on contrastive learning of the embeddings, and
demonstrate promising preliminary results for both of these. Finally, we lay
down an agenda for future research in this direction.

*Riccardo Fosco Gramaccioni,Christian Marinoni,Fabrizio Frezza,Aurelio Uncini,Danilo Comminiello*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了HA30K声学材料数据集和基于Stable Diffusion与ControlNet的深度学习方法来快速求解Helmholtz方程，替代计算昂贵的传统数值方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统数值方法（如有限元法）在模拟复杂声学材料中的波传播时计算成本高，特别是在大规模或实时场景下。需要更高效的计算方法。

Method: 构建包含31,000种声学材料的HA30K数据集，采用基于Stable Diffusion和ControlNet的深度学习模型，将解表示为图像，利用GPU并行化处理多个模拟。

Result: 该方法能够显著减少计算时间，通过调整扩散步骤在推理时平衡速度和质量，无需复杂仿真软件和显式方程求解。

Conclusion: 深度学习方法是早期研究阶段的有用工具，在快速探索比绝对精度更重要时特别有价值。

Abstract: Accurate simulation of wave propagation in complex acoustic materials is
crucial for applications in sound design, noise control, and material
engineering. Traditional numerical solvers, such as finite element methods, are
computationally expensive, especially when dealing with large-scale or
real-time scenarios. In this work, we introduce a dataset of 31,000 acoustic
materials, named HA30K, designed and simulated solving the Helmholtz equations.
For each material, we provide the geometric configuration and the corresponding
pressure field solution, enabling data-driven approaches to learn Helmholtz
equation solutions. As a baseline, we explore a deep learning approach based on
Stable Diffusion with ControlNet, a state-of-the-art model for image
generation. Unlike classical solvers, our approach leverages GPU
parallelization to process multiple simulations simultaneously, drastically
reducing computation time. By representing solutions as images, we bypass the
need for complex simulation software and explicit equation-solving.
Additionally, the number of diffusion steps can be adjusted at inference time,
balancing speed and quality. We aim to demonstrate that deep learning-based
methods are particularly useful in early-stage research, where rapid
exploration is more critical than absolute accuracy.

### [5] [Rescaling-Aware Training for Efficient Deployment of Deep Learning Models on Full-Integer Hardware](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11484)
*Lion Mueller,Alberto Garcia-Ortiz,Ardalan Najafi,Adam Fuks,Lennart Bamberg*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种降低整数AI推理中重缩放操作成本的方法，通过后训练强量化重缩放乘数，并引入重缩放感知训练来保持模型精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 整数AI推理在嵌入式系统中减少计算复杂度，但量化感知训练忽略了整数重缩放操作的影响，该操作在整数推理中是硬件成本高昂的。

Method: 后训练应用强量化到重缩放乘数，并引入重缩放感知训练方法进行微调。

Result: 即使重缩放器宽度减少8倍，通过最小增量重训练仍能保持完整精度。

Conclusion: 该方法使资源受限嵌入式系统的AI推理更加节能和成本高效。

Abstract: Integer AI inference significantly reduces computational complexity in
embedded systems. Quantization-aware training (QAT) helps mitigate accuracy
degradation associated with post-training quantization but still overlooks the
impact of integer rescaling during inference, which is a hardware costly
operation in integer-only AI inference. This work shows that rescaling cost can
be dramatically reduced post-training, by applying a stronger quantization to
the rescale multiplicands at no model-quality loss. Furthermore, we introduce
Rescale-Aware Training, a fine tuning method for ultra-low bit-width rescaling
multiplicands. Experiments show that even with 8x reduced rescaler widths, the
full accuracy is preserved through minimal incremental retraining. This enables
more energy-efficient and cost-efficient AI inference for resource-constrained
embedded systems.

### [6] [Gradient-Sign Masking for Task Vector Transport Across Pre-Trained Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09658)
*Filippo Rinaldi,Aniello Panariello,Giacomo Salici,Fengyuan Liu,Marco Ciccone,Angelo Porrello,Simone Calderara*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GradFix是一种无需额外微调的方法，通过利用新模型的梯度符号结构来跨不同预训练模型转移任务向量，仅需少量标注样本即可实现知识迁移。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当发布新的基础模型时，即使任务已在旧版本中解决，用户仍需重复完整微调。任务向量在不同预训练模型间转移失败的主要原因是参数空间不对齐。

Method: 基于梯度符号结构的关键洞察，提出GradFix方法：近似理想梯度符号结构，利用少量标注样本计算目标模型的几个梯度，并据此掩码源任务向量，实现局部对齐目标损失景观。

Result: 在视觉和语言基准测试中表现出显著性能提升，始终优于朴素任务向量相加和少样本微调方法。

Conclusion: GradFix通过梯度符号结构实现了任务向量在不同预训练模型间的有效转移，提供了一阶下降的理论保证，无需额外微调即可获得良好性能。

Abstract: When a new release of a foundation model is published, practitioners
typically need to repeat full fine-tuning, even if the same task has already
been solved in the previous version. A promising alternative is to reuse the
parameter changes (i.e., task vectors) that capture how a model adapts to a
specific task. However, they often fail to transfer across different
pre-trained models due to their misaligned parameter space. In this work, we
show that the key to successful transfer lies in the sign structure of the
gradients of the new model. Based on this insight, we propose GradFix, a novel
method that approximates the ideal gradient sign structure and leverages it to
transfer knowledge using only a handful of labeled samples. Notably, this
requires no additional fine-tuning: the adaptation is achieved by computing a
few gradients at the target model and masking the source task vector
accordingly. This yields an update that is locally aligned with the target loss
landscape, effectively rebasing the task vector onto the new pre-training. We
provide a theoretical guarantee that our method ensures first-order descent.
Empirically, we demonstrate significant performance gains on vision and
language benchmarks, consistently outperforming naive task vector addition and
few-shot fine-tuning.

### [7] [Heterogeneous Point Set Transformers for Segmentation of Multiple View Particle Detectors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09659)
*Edgar E. Robles,Dikshant Sagar,Alejandro Yankelevich,Jianming Bian,Pierre Baldi,NOvA Collaboration*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: NOvA实验使用点集神经网络处理稀疏2D图像数据，通过混合两个视图的信息，在内存使用减少90%的同时达到96.8%的AUC分数，优于独立处理视图的方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: NOvA实验需要将探测器中的原始命中点匹配到源粒子并识别粒子类型，传统方法使用聚类和CNN，但由于探测器结构，数据以两个稀疏2D图像（XZ和YZ视图）呈现而非3D表示。

Method: 提出点集神经网络，在稀疏矩阵上操作，通过混合两个视图信息的操作来处理数据。

Result: 模型内存使用比先前方法减少90%以上，达到96.8%的AUC分数，显著高于两个视图独立处理时的85.4%。

Conclusion: 点集神经网络能有效处理NOvA实验的稀疏2D数据，在减少内存使用的同时提高了粒子识别性能。

Abstract: NOvA is a long-baseline neutrino oscillation experiment that detects neutrino
particles from the NuMI beam at Fermilab. Before data from this experiment can
be used in analyses, raw hits in the detector must be matched to their source
particles, and the type of each particle must be identified. This task has
commonly been done using a mix of traditional clustering approaches and
convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Due to the construction of the detector,
the data is presented as two sparse 2D images: an XZ and a YZ view of the
detector, rather than a 3D representation. We propose a point set neural
network that operates on the sparse matrices with an operation that mixes
information from both views. Our model uses less than 10% of the memory
required using previous methods while achieving a 96.8% AUC score, a higher
score than obtained when both views are processed independently (85.4%).

### [8] [Learning What Matters: Steering Diffusion via Spectrally Anisotropic Forward Noise](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09660)
*Luca Scimeca,Thomas Jiralerspong,Berton Earnshaw,Jason Hartford,Yoshua Bengio*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文提出了谱各向异性高斯扩散(SAGD)，通过引入各向异性噪声算子来构建扩散概率模型的归纳偏置，用结构化的频率对角协方差替代各向同性前向协方差，从而更好地适应数据的目标分布。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散概率模型(DPMs)虽然取得了强大的生成性能，但其归纳偏置仍然很大程度上是隐式的。本文旨在将归纳偏置构建到扩散模型的训练和采样过程中，以更好地适应要建模的数据目标分布。

Method: 引入各向异性噪声算子，用结构化的频率对角协方差替代各向同性前向协方差，统一了带通掩码和幂律加权，允许强调或抑制指定的频带，同时保持前向过程为高斯分布。推导了各向异性协方差的得分关系。

Result: 经验表明，诱导的各向异性在多个视觉数据集上优于标准扩散模型，并能够实现选择性忽略：在特定频带内忽略已知的腐败模式进行学习。

Conclusion: 精心设计的各向异性前向噪声为在DPMs中定制归纳偏置提供了一个简单而原则性的方法。

Abstract: Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DPMs) have achieved strong generative
performance, yet their inductive biases remain largely implicit. In this work,
we aim to build inductive biases into the training and sampling of diffusion
models to better accommodate the target distribution of the data to model. We
introduce an anisotropic noise operator that shapes these biases by replacing
the isotropic forward covariance with a structured, frequency-diagonal
covariance. This operator unifies band-pass masks and power-law weightings,
allowing us to emphasize or suppress designated frequency bands, while keeping
the forward process Gaussian. We refer to this as spectrally anisotropic
Gaussian diffusion (SAGD). In this work, we derive the score relation for
anisotropic covariances and show that, under full support, the learned score
converges to the true data score as $t\!\to\!0$, while anisotropy reshapes the
probability-flow path from noise to data. Empirically, we show the induced
anisotropy outperforms standard diffusion across several vision datasets, and
enables selective omission: learning while ignoring known corruptions confined
to specific bands. Together, these results demonstrate that carefully designed
anisotropic forward noise provides a simple, yet principled, handle to tailor
inductive bias in DPMs.

### [9] [Assessment of different loss functions for fitting equivalent circuit models to electrochemical impedance spectroscopy data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09662)
*Ali Jaberi,Amin Sadeghi,Runze Zhang,Zhaoyang Zhao,Qiuyu Shi,Robert Black,Zoya Sadighi,Jason Hattrick-Simpers*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了两种基于Bode图表示的新型损失函数log-B和log-BW，用于电化学阻抗谱数据的等效电路模型拟合。通过大规模数据集评估，发现X2损失函数在拟合质量方面表现最佳，而log-B损失函数在计算效率和参数误差方面具有优势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的电化学阻抗谱数据拟合使用等效电路模型，通过非线性最小二乘拟合最小化损失函数。现有损失函数在收敛性、计算效率和拟合质量方面存在局限性，需要开发更优的损失函数来改进拟合性能。

Method: 基于EIS的Bode图表示推导出两种新型损失函数log-B和log-BW。使用生成的大规模EIS数据集，评估了这些损失函数与现有损失函数在R2分数、卡方值、计算效率和平均绝对百分比误差等方面的性能。

Result: 统计分析表明，损失函数的选择显著影响收敛性、计算效率、拟合质量和MAPE。X2损失函数在多个拟合质量指标上表现最佳，而log-B损失函数计算速度快约1.4倍，对大多数电路元件产生更低的MAPE。

Conclusion: 当拟合质量是首要目标时，X2损失函数是最佳选择；对于需要计算效率的大规模最小二乘拟合应用，log-B损失函数是一个强有力的替代方案，特别适用于数据驱动的机器学习模型训练等场景。

Abstract: Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) data is typically modeled using
an equivalent circuit model (ECM), with parameters obtained by minimizing a
loss function via nonlinear least squares fitting. This paper introduces two
new loss functions, log-B and log-BW, derived from the Bode representation of
EIS. Using a large dataset of generated EIS data, the performance of proposed
loss functions was evaluated alongside existing ones in terms of R2 scores,
chi-squared, computational efficiency, and the mean absolute percentage error
(MAPE) between the predicted component values and the original values.
Statistical comparisons revealed that the choice of loss function impacts
convergence, computational efficiency, quality of fit, and MAPE. Our analysis
showed that X2 loss function (squared sum of residuals with proportional
weighting) achieved the highest performance across multiple quality of fit
metrics, making it the preferred choice when the quality of fit is the primary
goal. On the other hand, log-B offered a slightly lower quality of fit while
being approximately 1.4 times faster and producing lower MAPE for most circuit
components, making log-B as a strong alternative. This is a critical factor for
large-scale least squares fitting in data-driven applications, such as training
machine learning models on extensive datasets or iterations.

*Changchang Sun,Vickie Chen,Yan Yan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出SODA方法，通过语义凝聚知识蒸馏解决跨模态哈希中多标签语义提取与原始多模态数据交互不足的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度跨模态哈希方法在多标签语义提取过程中未能与原始多模态数据显式交互，导致学习到的表示级语义信息与异构多模态数据不兼容，阻碍了模态间隙的弥合。

Method: 将多标签信息作为新的文本模态，构建真实标签提示集；设计跨模态教师网络在图像和标签模态间蒸馏语义特征，学习图像模态的汉明空间；将该空间作为先验知识指导学生网络学习，保持图像和文本模态间的语义相似性。

Result: 在两个基准数据集上的广泛实验证明了该方法优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: SODA方法通过语义凝聚知识蒸馏有效解决了跨模态哈希中的语义兼容性问题，显著提升了性能。

Abstract: Recently, deep supervised cross-modal hashing methods have achieve compelling
success by learning semantic information in a self-supervised way. However,
they still suffer from the key limitation that the multi-label semantic
extraction process fail to explicitly interact with raw multimodal data, making
the learned representation-level semantic information not compatible with the
heterogeneous multimodal data and hindering the performance of bridging
modality gap. To address this limitation, in this paper, we propose a novel
semantic cohesive knowledge distillation scheme for deep cross-modal hashing,
dubbed as SODA. Specifically, the multi-label information is introduced as a
new textual modality and reformulated as a set of ground-truth label prompt,
depicting the semantics presented in the image like the text modality. Then, a
cross-modal teacher network is devised to effectively distill cross-modal
semantic characteristics between image and label modalities and thus learn a
well-mapped Hamming space for image modality. In a sense, such Hamming space
can be regarded as a kind of prior knowledge to guide the learning of
cross-modal student network and comprehensively preserve the semantic
similarities between image and text modality. Extensive experiments on two
benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of our model over the
state-of-the-art methods.

*Yihua Cheng,Yuhan Liu,Jiayi Yao,Yuwei An,Xiaokun Chen,Shaoting Feng,Yuyang Huang,Samuel Shen,Kuntai Du,Junchen Jiang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LMCache是一个高效的KV缓存解决方案，通过跨引擎和查询共享KV缓存来提升LLM推理系统的资源利用率，支持缓存卸载和预填充-解码解耦，在vLLM上实现了高达15倍的吞吐量提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM推理系统将引擎和查询独立处理导致资源效率低下，现有方案无法有效实现跨查询的KV缓存重用和跨引擎的查询解耦，需要高效的KV缓存卸载和通信机制。

Method: LMCache提取并存储现代LLM引擎生成的KV缓存，在引擎接口中暴露KV缓存，支持缓存卸载和预填充-解码解耦，采用批量数据移动、计算与I/O流水线等优化，提供模块化连接器和控制API。

Result: LMCache与vLLM结合在多样化工作负载下实现了高达15倍的吞吐量提升，已被企业推理系统广泛采用。

Conclusion: LMCache是首个高效的开源KV缓存解决方案，通过将LLM引擎从独立令牌处理器转变为以KV缓存为存储和通信介质的引擎集合，显著提升了系统性能，为未来KV缓存解决方案提供了宝贵经验。

Abstract: Today's LLM inference systems treat individual engines and queries
independently for simplicity, but this causes significant resource
inefficiencies. While there are proposals to avoid redundant computation by
reusing KV caches across queries and to increase GPU utilization by
disaggregating a single query to different engines, their promises cannot be
realized without efficiently offloading and communicating KV cache across LLM
inference engines and queries.
  We present LMCache, the first and so far the most efficient open-source KV
caching solution, which extracts and stores KV caches generated by modern LLM
engines (vLLM and SGLang) and shares the KV caches across engines and queries.
LMCache exposes KV caches in the LLM engine interface, effectively transforming
LLM engines from individual token processors to a collection of engines with KV
cache as the storage and communication medium. In particular, it supports both
cache offloading (prefix reuse across queries) and prefill-decode
disaggregation (cross-engine cache transfer). LMCache's high performance and
wide adoption stem from the following contributions: highly optimized KV cache
data movement with performance optimizations including batched data movement
operations, compute and I/O pipelining; a modular KV cache connector component,
decoupling LMCache from the rapid evolution of inference engines; a first-class
control API, such as pinning, lookup, cleanup, movement, and compression, for
flexible cache orchestration across GPU, CPU, storage, and network layers.
Evaluation shows that combining LMCache with vLLM achieves up to 15x
improvement in throughput across diverse workloads. With a growing community,
LMCache has seen dramatic growth in adoption by enterprise inference systems,
which provides valuable lessons for future KV caching solutions. The source
code of LMCache is at: https://github.com/LMCache/LMCache.

Abstract: Climate change is intensifying wildfire risks globally, making reliable
forecasting critical for adaptation strategies. While machine learning shows
promise for wildfire prediction from Earth observation data, current approaches
lack uncertainty quantification essential for risk-aware decision making. We
present the first systematic analysis of spatial uncertainty in wildfire spread
forecasting using multimodal Earth observation inputs. We demonstrate that
predictive uncertainty exhibits coherent spatial structure concentrated near
fire perimeters. Our novel distance metric reveals high-uncertainty regions
form consistent 20-60 meter buffer zones around predicted firelines - directly
applicable for emergency planning. Feature attribution identifies vegetation
health and fire activity as primary uncertainty drivers. This work enables more
robust wildfire management systems supporting communities adapting to
increasing fire risk under climate change.

TL;DR: 提出一个可解释且高效的药物相互作用预测框架，结合分子嵌入和临床知识，通过三阶段元启发式优化实现高精度预测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 药物相互作用是导致可预防不良事件的主要原因，同时了解哪些药物不相互作用对于安全处方和改善患者预后同样重要。

Method: 结合Mol2Vec和SMILES-BERT两种分子嵌入，引入无泄漏的基于规则的临床评分(RBScore)，使用三阶段元启发式策略(RSmpl-ACO-PSO)优化轻量级神经网络分类器。

Result: 在真实数据集上实现高预测精度(ROC-AUC 0.911, PR-AUC 0.867)，在2型糖尿病队列中泛化良好，嵌入融合、RBScore和优化器均有助于提升精度和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该研究为构建可靠、可解释且计算高效的模型提供了实用途径，可支持更安全的药物治疗和临床决策。

Abstract: Drug-drug interactions (DDIs) are a leading cause of preventable adverse
events, often complicating treatment and increasing healthcare costs. At the
same time, knowing which drugs do not interact is equally important, as such
knowledge supports safer prescriptions and better patient outcomes. In this
study, we propose an interpretable and efficient framework that blends modern
machine learning with domain knowledge to improve DDI prediction. Our approach
combines two complementary molecular embeddings - Mol2Vec, which captures
fragment-level structural patterns, and SMILES-BERT, which learns contextual
chemical features - together with a leakage-free, rule-based clinical score
(RBScore) that injects pharmacological knowledge without relying on interaction
labels. A lightweight neural classifier is then optimized using a novel
three-stage metaheuristic strategy (RSmpl-ACO-PSO), which balances global
exploration and local refinement for stable performance. Experiments on
real-world datasets demonstrate that the model achieves high predictive
accuracy (ROC-AUC 0.911, PR-AUC 0.867 on DrugBank) and generalizes well to a
clinically relevant Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus cohort. Beyond raw performance,
studies show how embedding fusion, RBScore, and the optimizer each contribute
to precision and robustness. Together, these results highlight a practical
pathway for building reliable, interpretable, and computationally efficient
models that can support safer drug therapies and clinical decision-making.

Abstract: It is increasingly important to generate synthetic populations with explicit
coordinates rather than coarse geographic areas, yet no established methods
exist to achieve this. One reason is that latitude and longitude differ from
other continuous variables, exhibiting large empty spaces and highly uneven
densities. To address this, we propose a population synthesis algorithm that
first maps spatial coordinates into a more regular latent space using
Normalizing Flows (NF), and then combines them with other features in a
Variational Autoencoder (VAE) to generate synthetic populations. This approach
also learns the joint distribution between spatial and non-spatial features,
exploiting spatial autocorrelations. We demonstrate the method by generating
synthetic homes with the same statistical properties of real homes in 121
datasets, corresponding to diverse geographies. We further propose an
evaluation framework that measures both spatial accuracy and practical utility,
while ensuring privacy preservation. Our results show that the NF+VAE
architecture outperforms popular benchmarks, including copula-based methods and
uniform allocation within geographic areas. The ability to generate geolocated
synthetic populations at fine spatial resolution opens the door to applications
requiring detailed geography, from household responses to floods, to epidemic
spread, evacuation planning, and transport modeling.

Conclusion: 研究强调了在开发反应性材料的AI加速模拟工具时，领域特定考虑的重要性。

Abstract: Modeling shock-to-detonation phenomena in energetic materials (EMs) requires
capturing complex physical processes such as strong shocks, rapid changes in
microstructural morphology, and nonlinear dynamics of chemical reaction fronts.
These processes participate in energy localization at hotspots, which initiate
chemical energy release leading to detonation. This study addresses the
formation of hotspots in crystalline EMs subjected to weak-to-moderate shock
loading, which, despite its critical relevance to the safe storage and handling
of EMs, remains underexplored compared to the well-studied strong shock
conditions. To overcome the computational challenges associated with direct
numerical simulations, we advance the Physics-Aware Recurrent Convolutional
Neural Network (PARCv2), which has been shown to be capable of predicting
strong shock responses in EMs. We improved the architecture of PARCv2 to
rapidly predict shear localizations and plastic heating, which play important
roles in the weak-to-moderate shock regime. PARCv2 is benchmarked against two
widely used physics-informed models, namely, Fourier neural operator and neural
ordinary differential equation; we demonstrate its superior performance in
capturing the spatiotemporal dynamics of shear band formation. While all models
exhibit certain failure modes, our findings underscore the importance of
domain-specific considerations in developing robust AI-accelerated simulation
tools for reactive materials.

Abstract: Inverse problems, where the goal is to recover an unknown signal from noisy
or incomplete measurements, are central to applications in medical imaging,
remote sensing, and computational biology. Diffusion models have recently
emerged as powerful priors for solving such problems. However, existing methods
either rely on projection-based techniques that enforce measurement consistency
through heuristic updates, or they approximate the likelihood $p(\boldsymbol{y}
\mid \boldsymbol{x})$, often resulting in artifacts and instability under
complex or high-noise conditions. To address these limitations, we propose a
novel framework called \emph{coupled data and measurement space diffusion
posterior sampling} (C-DPS), which eliminates the need for constraint tuning or
likelihood approximation. C-DPS introduces a forward stochastic process in the
measurement space $\{\boldsymbol{y}_t\}$, evolving in parallel with the
data-space diffusion $\{\boldsymbol{x}_t\}$, which enables the derivation of a
closed-form posterior $p(\boldsymbol{x}_{t-1} \mid \boldsymbol{x}_t,
\boldsymbol{y}_{t-1})$. This coupling allows for accurate and recursive
sampling based on a well-defined posterior distribution. Empirical results
demonstrate that C-DPS consistently outperforms existing baselines, both
qualitatively and quantitatively, across multiple inverse problem benchmarks.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Low-Altitude Economy Networks (LAENets) has enabled
a variety of applications, including aerial surveillance, environmental
sensing, and semantic data collection. To support these scenarios, unmanned
aerial vehicles (UAVs) equipped with onboard vision-language models (VLMs)
offer a promising solution for real-time multimodal inference. However,
ensuring both inference accuracy and communication efficiency remains a
significant challenge due to limited onboard resources and dynamic network
conditions. In this paper, we first propose a UAV-enabled LAENet system model
that jointly captures UAV mobility, user-UAV communication, and the onboard
visual question answering (VQA) pipeline. Based on this model, we formulate a
mixed-integer non-convex optimization problem to minimize task latency and
power consumption under user-specific accuracy constraints. To solve the
problem, we design a hierarchical optimization framework composed of two parts:
(i) an Alternating Resolution and Power Optimization (ARPO) algorithm for
resource allocation under accuracy constraints, and (ii) a Large Language
Model-augmented Reinforcement Learning Approach (LLaRA) for adaptive UAV
trajectory optimization. The large language model (LLM) serves as an expert in
refining reward design of reinforcement learning in an offline fashion,
introducing no additional latency in real-time decision-making. Numerical
results demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed framework in improving
inference performance and communication efficiency under dynamic LAENet
conditions.

Abstract: We propose a simple yet effective use of LLM-powered AI tools to improve
causal estimation. In double machine learning, the accuracy of causal estimates
of the effect of a treatment on an outcome in the presence of a
high-dimensional confounder depends on the performance of estimators of
conditional expectation functions. We show that predictions made by generative
models trained on historical data can be used to improve the performance of
these estimators relative to approaches that solely rely on adjusting for
embeddings extracted from these models. We argue that the historical knowledge
and reasoning capacities associated with these generative models can help
overcome curse-of-dimensionality problems in causal inference problems. We
consider a case study using a small dataset of online jewelry auctions, and
demonstrate that inclusion of LLM-generated guesses as predictors can improve
efficiency in estimation.

Abstract: Classical consensus-based strategies for federated and decentralized learning
are statistically suboptimal in the presence of heterogeneous local data or
task distributions. As a result, in recent years, there has been growing
interest in multitask or personalized strategies, which allow individual agents
to benefit from one another in pursuing locally optimal models without
enforcing consensus. Existing strategies require either precise prior knowledge
of the underlying task relationships or are fully non-parametric and instead
rely on meta-learning or proximal constructions. In this work, we introduce an
algorithmic framework that strikes a balance between these extremes. By
modeling task relationships through a Gaussian Markov Random Field with an
unknown precision matrix, we develop a strategy that jointly learns both the
task relationships and the local models, allowing agents to self-organize in a
way consistent with their individual data distributions. Our theoretical
analysis quantifies the quality of the learned relationship, and our numerical
experiments demonstrate its practical effectiveness.

Abstract: Deep learning has become a pivotal technology in fields such as computer
vision, scientific computing, and dynamical systems, significantly advancing
these disciplines. However, neural Networks persistently face challenges
related to theoretical understanding, interpretability, and generalization. To
address these issues, researchers are increasingly adopting a differential

design methodologies for neural networks. In this paper, we provide an
extensive review of deep neural network architectures and dynamic modeling
methods inspired by differential equations. We specifically examine deep neural
network models and deterministic dynamical network constructs based on ordinary
differential equations (ODEs), as well as regularization techniques and
stochastic dynamical network models informed by stochastic differential
equations (SDEs). We present numerical comparisons of these models to
illustrate their characteristics and performance. Finally, we explore promising
research directions in integrating differential equations with deep learning to
offer new insights for developing intelligent computational methods that boast
enhanced interpretability and generalization capabilities.

Abstract: This study delves into the plasticity of neural networks, offering empirical
support for the notion that critical learning periods and warm-starting
performance loss can be avoided through simple adjustments to learning
hyperparameters. The critical learning phenomenon emerges when training is
initiated with deficit data. Subsequently, after numerous deficit epochs, the
network's plasticity wanes, impeding its capacity to achieve parity in accuracy
with models trained from scratch, even when extensive clean data training
follows deficit epochs. Building upon seminal research introducing critical
learning periods, we replicate key findings and broaden the experimental scope
of the main experiment from the original work. In addition, we consider a
warm-starting approach and show that it can be seen as a form of deficit
pretraining. In particular, we demonstrate that these problems can be averted
by employing a cyclic learning rate schedule. Our findings not only impact
neural network training practices but also establish a vital link between
critical learning periods and ongoing research on warm-starting neural network
training.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦学习虽然保护了数据隐私，但固定的差分隐私预算会在模型收敛时引入过多噪声，影响性能。因此需要研究自适应隐私预算方法来平衡隐私保护和模型准确性。

Method: 使用Laplace和Gaussian机制实现差分隐私，在Gaussian机制中引入自适应裁剪方法，动态更新梯度敏感度而非使用固定值。扩展了SelecEval模拟器，在不同隐私预算、IID/非IID数据集和不同客户端选择数量下进行实验。

Result: 虽然实验仅进行了200轮训练，但结果表明自适应隐私预算和自适应裁剪方法能够在保护隐私的同时帮助维持模型准确性。

Conclusion: 自适应隐私预算和自适应裁剪是联邦学习中平衡隐私保护与模型性能的有效方法，特别是在模型收敛阶段能够减少不必要的噪声添加。

Abstract: Federated learning is distributed model training across several clients
without disclosing raw data. Despite advancements in data privacy, risks still
remain. Differential Privacy (DP) is a technique to protect sensitive data by
adding noise to model updates, usually controlled by a fixed privacy budget.
However, this approach can introduce excessive noise, particularly when the
model converges, which compromises performance. To address this problem,
adaptive privacy budgets have been investigated as a potential solution. This
work implements DP methods using Laplace and Gaussian mechanisms with an
adaptive privacy budget, extending the SelecEval simulator. We introduce an
adaptive clipping approach in the Gaussian mechanism, ensuring that gradients
of the model are dynamically updated rather than using a fixed sensitivity. We
conduct extensive experiments with various privacy budgets, IID and non-IID
datasets, and different numbers of selected clients per round. While our
experiments were limited to 200 training rounds, the results suggest that
adaptive privacy budgets and adaptive clipping can help maintain model accuracy
while preserving privacy.

Abstract: Partial differential equations (PDEs) underpin models across science and
engineering, yet analytical solutions are atypical and classical mesh-based
solvers can be costly in high dimensions. This dissertation presents a unified
comparison of three mesh-free neural PDE solvers, physics-informed neural
networks (PINNs), the deep Ritz method (DRM), and weak adversarial networks
(WANs), on Poisson problems (up to 5D) and the time-independent Schr\"odinger
equation in 1D/2D (infinite well and harmonic oscillator), and extends the
study to a laser-driven case of Schr\"odinger's equation via the
Kramers-Henneberger (KH) transformation.
  Under a common protocol, all methods achieve low $L_2$ errors
($10^{-6}$-$10^{-9}$) when paired with forced boundary conditions (FBCs),
forced nodes (FNs), and orthogonality regularization (OG). Across tasks, PINNs
are the most reliable for accuracy and recovery of excited spectra; DRM offers
the best accuracy-runtime trade-off on stationary problems; WAN is more
sensitive but competitive when weak-form constraints and FN/OG are used
effectively. Sensitivity analyses show that FBC removes boundary-loss tuning,
network width matters more than depth for single-network solvers, and most
gains occur within 5000-10,000 epochs. The same toolkit solves the KH case,
indicating transfer beyond canonical benchmarks.
  We provide practical guidelines for method selection and outline the
following extensions: time-dependent formulations for DRM and WAN, adaptive
residual-driven sampling, parallel multi-state training, and neural domain
decomposition. These results support physics-guided neural solvers as credible,
scalable tools for solving complex PDEs.

Motivation: 现有的大模型安全护栏多为事后检测，可能在检测前就暴露不安全内容，且延迟限制迫使其使用轻量级模型，限制了检测准确性。

Method: 提出Kelp框架，通过流式潜在动态头(SLD)建模风险在生成序列中的时间演化，引入锚定时间一致性(ATC)损失来强制执行单调的危害预测，并创建StreamGuardBench基准进行严格评估。

Result: 在多样化模型和数据集上，Kelp始终优于最先进的事后检测护栏和先前的插件探针(平均F1提高15.61%)，仅使用2000万参数且每token延迟增加不到0.5毫秒。

Conclusion: Kelp提供了一种高效、准确的流式风险检测解决方案，能够在大模型生成过程中实时识别和预防有害内容。

Abstract: Large models (LMs) are powerful content generators, yet their open-ended
nature can also introduce potential risks, such as generating harmful or biased
content. Existing guardrails mostly perform post-hoc detection that may expose
unsafe content before it is caught, and the latency constraints further push
them toward lightweight models, limiting detection accuracy. In this work, we
propose Kelp, a novel plug-in framework that enables streaming risk detection
within the LM generation pipeline. Kelp leverages intermediate LM hidden states
through a Streaming Latent Dynamics Head (SLD), which models the temporal
evolution of risk across the generated sequence for more accurate real-time
risk detection. To ensure reliable streaming moderation in real applications,
we introduce an Anchored Temporal Consistency (ATC) loss to enforce monotonic
harm predictions by embedding a benign-then-harmful temporal prior. Besides,
for a rigorous evaluation of streaming guardrails, we also present
StreamGuardBench-a model-grounded benchmark featuring on-the-fly responses from
each protected model, reflecting real-world streaming scenarios in both text
and vision-language tasks. Across diverse models and datasets, Kelp
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art post-hoc guardrails and prior plug-in
probes (15.61% higher average F1), while using only 20M parameters and adding
less than 0.5 ms of per-token latency.

Conclusion: VCON提供了一个可推广的方法，可应用于现有的压缩技术，在多个基准测试中显示出一致的性能提升。

Abstract: The increasing scale of deep neural networks has led to a growing need for
compression techniques such as pruning, quantization, and low-rank
decomposition. While these methods are very effective in reducing memory,
computation and energy consumption, they often introduce severe accuracy
degradation when applied directly. We introduce Vanishing Contributions (VCON),
a general approach for smoothly transitioning neural models into compressed
form. Rather than replacing the original network directly with its compressed
version, VCON executes the two in parallel during fine-tuning. The contribution
of the original (uncompressed) model is progressively reduced, while that of
the compressed model is gradually increased. This smooth transition allows the
network to adapt over time, improving stability and mitigating accuracy
degradation. We evaluate VCON across computer vision and natural language
processing benchmarks, in combination with multiple compression strategies.
Across all scenarios, VCON leads to consistent improvements: typical gains
exceed 3%, while some configuration exhibits accuracy boosts of 20%. VCON thus
provides a generalizable method that can be applied to the existing compression
techniques, with evidence of consistent gains across multiple benchmarks.

Abstract: Time domain simulation, i.e., modeling the system's evolution over time, is a
crucial tool for studying and enhancing power system stability and dynamic
performance. However, these simulations become computationally intractable for
renewable-penetrated grids, due to the small simulation time step required to
capture renewable energy resources' ultra-fast dynamic phenomena in the range
of 1-50 microseconds. This creates a critical need for solutions that are both
fast and scalable, posing a major barrier for the stable integration of
renewable energy resources and thus climate change mitigation. This paper
explores operator learning, a family of machine learning methods that learn
mappings between functions, as a surrogate model for these costly simulations.
The paper investigates, for the first time, the fundamental concept of
simulation time step-invariance, which enables models trained on coarse time
steps to generalize to fine-resolution dynamics. Three operator learning
methods are benchmarked on a simple test system that, while not incorporating
practical complexities of renewable-penetrated grids, serves as a first
proof-of-concept to demonstrate the viability of time step-invariance. Models
are evaluated on (i) zero-shot super-resolution, where training is performed on
a coarse simulation time step and inference is performed at super-resolution,
and (ii) generalization between stable and unstable dynamic regimes. This work
addresses a key challenge in the integration of renewable energy for the
mitigation of climate change by benchmarking operator learning methods to model
physical systems.

Abstract: Static feature exclusion strategies often fail to prevent bias when hidden
dependencies influence the model predictions. To address this issue, we explore
a reinforcement learning (RL) framework that integrates bias mitigation and
automated feature selection within a single learning process. Unlike
traditional heuristic-driven filter or wrapper approaches, our RL agent
adaptively selects features using a reward signal that explicitly integrates
predictive performance with fairness considerations. This dynamic formulation
allows the model to balance generalization, accuracy, and equity throughout the
training process, rather than rely exclusively on pre-processing adjustments or
post hoc correction mechanisms. In this paper, we describe the construction of
a multi-component reward function, the specification of the agents action space
over feature subsets, and the integration of this system with ensemble
learning. We aim to provide a flexible and generalizable way to select features
in environments where predictors are correlated and biases can inadvertently
re-emerge.

comments-authored by real users or by large language models (LLMs)-that subtly
shift model decisions. In view of this, we first present a comprehensive
evaluation of comment attacks to existing fake news detectors and then
introduce a group-adaptive adversarial training strategy to improve the
robustness of FND models. To be specific, our approach comprises three steps:
(1) dividing adversarial comments into three psychologically grounded
categories: perceptual, cognitive, and societal; (2) generating diverse,
category-specific attacks via LLMs to enhance adversarial training; and (3)
applying a Dirichlet-based adaptive sampling mechanism (InfoDirichlet Adjusting
Mechanism) that dynamically adjusts the learning focus across different comment
categories during training. Experiments on benchmark datasets show that our
method maintains strong detection accuracy while substantially increasing
robustness to a wide range of adversarial comment perturbations.

*Zhenlong Liu,Hao Zeng,Weiran Huang,Hongxin Wei*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出PTDI方法，用于在大规模模型中识别训练数据，具有严格的错误发现率控制，相比现有方法具有更强的统计保证和更高的检测能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有训练数据识别方法缺乏统计保证，或依赖易违反的假设，需要一种能严格控制错误发现率的可靠方法。

Method: 使用已知未见数据计算每个数据点的p值，构建测试集数据使用比例的保守估计量来缩放p值，然后通过数据依赖阈值选择训练数据集。

Result: 在多种模型和数据集上的实验表明，PTDI能严格控制错误发现率，并实现更高的检测能力。

Conclusion: PTDI为训练数据识别提供了具有严格统计保证的解决方案，在版权诉讼、隐私审计和公平评估中具有重要应用价值。

Abstract: Identifying training data within large-scale models is critical for copyright
litigation, privacy auditing, and ensuring fair evaluation. The conventional
approaches treat it as a simple binary classification task without statistical
guarantees. A recent approach is designed to control the false discovery rate
(FDR), but its guarantees rely on strong, easily violated assumptions. In this
paper, we introduce Provable Training Data Identification (PTDI), a rigorous
method that identifies a set of training data with strict false discovery rate
(FDR) control. Specifically, our method computes p-values for each data point
using a set of known unseen data, and then constructs a conservative estimator
for the data usage proportion of the test set, which allows us to scale these
p-values. Our approach then selects the final set of training data by
identifying all points whose scaled p-values fall below a data-dependent
threshold. This entire procedure enables the discovery of training data with
provable, strict FDR control and significantly boosted power. Extensive
experiments across a wide range of models (LLMs and VLMs), and datasets
demonstrate that PTDI strictly controls the FDR and achieves higher power.

TL;DR: 提出了一种联邦k-means聚类方法，设备在不共享本地数据集的情况下，通过添加惩罚项来协调相邻设备间的聚类中心差异，实现联合聚类。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决联邦聚类问题，使互联设备能够在不共享本地数据集的情况下，基于k-means原理对整体数据集进行联合聚类。

Method: 将联邦k-means聚类表述为GTVMin问题，每个设备通过求解修改后的本地k-means问题来更新本地聚类中心，修改包括添加惩罚项来衡量相邻设备间聚类中心的差异。

Result: 开发出隐私友好的联邦k-means算法，仅需在互联设备间共享聚合信息。

Conclusion: 该方法成功实现了在保护隐私的前提下进行联邦聚类，为分布式环境下的数据聚类提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: We consider the problem of federated clustering, where interconnected devices
have access to private local datasets and need to jointly cluster the overall
dataset without sharing their local dataset. Our focus is on hard clustering
based on the k-means principle. We formulate federated k-means clustering as an
instance of GTVMin. This formulation naturally lends to a federated k-means
algorithm where each device updates local cluster centroids by solving a
modified local k-means problem. The modification involves adding a penalty term
to measure the discrepancy between the cluster centroid of neighbouring
devices. Our federated k-means algorithm is privacy-friendly as it only
requires sharing aggregated information among interconnected devices.

TL;DR: 提出了一种使用上下文向量表示模型能力的新路由方法，通过两阶段训练实现动态模型选择，无需重新训练即可集成新模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有模型路由方法依赖准确的模型表示，添加新模型通常需要重新训练，限制了可扩展性。

Method: 两阶段方法：1) 查询嵌入和投影到向量空间，训练投影器和基于LLM的路由器重建原始查询；2) 基于查询和模型性能的上下文向量，路由器学习预测模型是否能正确回答新查询。

Result: 在分布内和分布外任务中实现了最先进的路由性能，能够无缝集成新模型而无需重新训练路由器。

Conclusion: 该方法通过上下文向量有效表示模型能力，显著提升了模型路由的可扩展性和性能。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often exhibit complementary strengths. Model
routing harnesses these strengths by dynamically directing each query to the
most suitable model, given a candidate model pool. However, routing performance
relies on accurate model representations, and adding new models typically
requires retraining, limiting scalability. To address these challenges, we
propose a novel routing method using in-context vectors to represent model
capabilities. The method proceeds in two stages. First, queries are embedded
and projected into vectors, with a projector and LLM-based router trained to
reconstruct the original queries, aligning vector representations with the
router's semantic space. Second, each candidate model is profiled on a query
set, and the router learns -- based on in-context vectors of query and model
performance -- to predict whether each model can correctly answer new queries.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art
routing performance in both in-distribution and out-of-distribution tasks.
Moreover, our method allows for seamless integration of new models without
retraining the router. The code is available at

Motivation: 探索使用自然语言而非数值优化来定义和优化机器学习模型的方法，旨在提高模型的可解释性和准确性。

Method: 完全使用自然语言定义模型，通过解释性提示迭代优化分类标准，在3个合成和3个自然数据集上进行实验，与7个基线可解释机器学习模型比较。

Result: 在6个数据集中的5个上，Narrative Learning因语言模型改进而比基线可解释模型更准确。同时分析了模型输出的词汇统计特征作为解释可理解性的代理指标。

Conclusion: Narrative Learning方法展示了使用自然语言定义和优化机器学习模型的潜力，随着语言模型的改进，该方法在准确性和可解释性方面具有优势。

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce Narrative Learning, a methodology where models
are defined entirely in natural language and iteratively refine their
classification criteria using explanatory prompts rather than traditional
numerical optimisation. We report on experiments to evaluate the accuracy and
potential of this approach using 3 synthetic and 3 natural datasets and compare
them against 7 baseline explainable machine learning models. We demonstrate
that on 5 out of 6 of these datasets, Narrative Learning became more accurate
than the baseline explainable models in 2025 or earlier because of improvements
in language models. We also report on trends in the lexicostatistics of these
models' outputs as a proxy for the comprehensibility of the explanations.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文探索了在过程模型发现中通过逐步减少行为输入来保持LLM生成解释质量的方法，发现在适度减少输入的情况下解释质量基本保持不变，为资源受限环境下的过程分析提供了计算效率的解决方案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型越来越多地用于生成过程模型的文本解释，但从大型行为抽象（如直接跟随图或Petri网）生成解释计算成本高昂。本研究旨在评估在逐步减少行为输入的情况下解释质量的变化。

Method: 采用三阶段流水线：(i)从固定日志的逐步缩小前缀中发现多个模型，(ii)提示LLM生成解释，(iii)使用第二个LLM评估完整性、瓶颈识别和改进建议。

Result: 在合成日志上，适度减少输入时解释质量基本保持不变，表明存在实用的成本-质量权衡。

Conclusion: 这项探索性研究表明，在资源受限环境下，通过逐步减少行为输入可以实现更高效的计算，同时保持LLM辅助过程分析的质量，为实际应用提供了可行路径。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used to generate textual
explanations of process models discovered from event logs. Producing
explanations from large behavioral abstractions (e.g., directly-follows graphs
or Petri nets) can be computationally expensive. This paper reports an
exploratory evaluation of explanation quality under progressive
behavioral-input reduction, where models are discovered from progressively
smaller prefixes of a fixed log. Our pipeline (i) discovers models at multiple
input sizes, (ii) prompts an LLM to generate explanations, and (iii) uses a
second LLM to assess completeness, bottleneck identification, and suggested
improvements. On synthetic logs, explanation quality is largely preserved under
moderate reduction, indicating a practical cost-quality trade-off. The study is
exploratory, as the scores are LLM-based (comparative signals rather than
ground truth) and the data are synthetic. The results suggest a path toward
more computationally efficient, LLM-assisted process analysis in
resource-constrained settings.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ARROW提出了一种自适应滚动多尺度时间路由方法，用于解决现有天气预测方法在建模时空依赖性和滚动策略方面的局限性，通过多间隔预测模型和基于强化学习的自适应调度器实现了最先进的全球天气预报性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数据驱动的天气预报方法通常基于固定短时间间隔建模，依赖朴素自回归滚动进行长期预测，存在两个关键问题：(1) 难以充分建模全球天气系统的空间和多尺度时间依赖性；(2) 滚动策略难以平衡误差累积与精细大气变化的捕捉。

Method: 构建多间隔预测模型，使用共享-私有专家混合机制捕获不同时间尺度的大气动力学模式，采用环形位置编码准确表示地球的纬度结构，并开发基于强化学习的自适应滚动调度器来选择最合适的时间间隔进行预测。

Result: 实验结果表明ARROW在全球天气预报中实现了最先进的性能，为该领域建立了一个有前景的范式。

Conclusion: ARROW通过多尺度时间建模和自适应滚动策略，有效解决了现有天气预报方法的局限性，为全球天气预报提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Weather forecasting is a fundamental task in spatiotemporal data analysis,
with broad applications across a wide range of domains. Existing data-driven
forecasting methods typically model atmospheric dynamics over a fixed short
time interval (e.g., 6 hours) and rely on naive autoregression-based rollout
for long-term forecasting (e.g., 138 hours). However, this paradigm suffers
from two key limitations: (1) it often inadequately models the spatial and
multi-scale temporal dependencies inherent in global weather systems, and (2)
the rollout strategy struggles to balance error accumulation with the capture
of fine-grained atmospheric variations. In this study, we propose ARROW, an
Adaptive-Rollout Multi-scale temporal Routing method for Global Weather
Forecasting. To contend with the first limitation, we construct a
multi-interval forecasting model that forecasts weather across different time
intervals. Within the model, the Shared-Private Mixture-of-Experts captures
both shared patterns and specific characteristics of atmospheric dynamics
across different time scales, while Ring Positional Encoding accurately encodes
the circular latitude structure of the Earth when representing spatial
information. For the second limitation, we develop an adaptive rollout
scheduler based on reinforcement learning, which selects the most suitable time
interval to forecast according to the current weather state. Experimental
results demonstrate that ARROW achieves state-of-the-art performance in global
weather forecasting, establishing a promising paradigm in this field.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: InterCorpRel-LLM是一个跨模态框架，结合图神经网络和大型语言模型，用于识别企业间关系（如供应链和竞争关系），在供应链关系识别任务中显著优于GPT-5等基线模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 企业间关系识别对金融分析和公司治理至关重要，但由于企业数据的规模、稀疏性和上下文依赖性而具有挑战性。图方法能捕捉结构但缺乏语义深度，而LLM擅长文本但表示关系依赖的能力有限。

Method: 提出InterCorpRel-LLM框架，集成GNN和LLM，使用FactSet供应链记录构建专有数据集，并设计了三个训练任务：公司图匹配、行业分类和供应链关系预测。

Result: 在供应链关系识别任务中，InterCorpRel-LLM大幅优于强基线模型（包括GPT-5），F分数达到0.8543（对比GPT-5的0.2287），仅使用7B参数骨干网络和轻量训练。模型还能零样本泛化到竞争者识别任务。

Conclusion: 该框架为分析师和战略家提供了强大的工具，用于映射和推理复杂的企业网络，增强动态市场中的决策制定和风险管理能力。

Abstract: Identifying inter-firm relationships such as supply and competitive ties is
critical for financial analysis and corporate governance, yet remains
challenging due to the scale, sparsity, and contextual dependence of corporate
data. Graph-based methods capture structure but miss semantic depth, while
large language models (LLMs) excel at text but remain limited in their ability
to represent relational dependencies. To address this, we propose
InterCorpRel-LLM, a cross-modal framework that integrates GNNs with LLMs,
supported by a proprietary dataset derived from FactSet supply chain records
and three tailored training tasks: company graph matching, industry
classification, and supply relation prediction. This design enables effective
joint modeling of structure and semantics. Experiments show that
InterCorpRel-LLM substantially outperforms strong baselines, including GPT-5,
on a supply relation identification task, achieving an F-score of 0.8543 vs.
0.2287 with only a 7B-parameter backbone and lightweight training. The model
also generalizes to zero-shot competitor identification, underscoring its
ability to capture nuanced inter-firm dynamics. Our framework thus provides
analysts and strategists with a robust tool for mapping and reasoning about
complex corporate networks, enhancing decision-making and risk management in
dynamic markets.

Motivation: 检验词汇假说，探索机器学习能否替代传统人格模型，验证Big Five模型的生态效度。

Method: 从经典形容词列表使用机器学习构建人格模型，与Big Five模型对比分析100万条Reddit评论。

Result: Big Five模型（特别是宜人性、尽责性和神经质）在描述在线社区方面更强大、更可解释；机器学习聚类无法提供有意义的区分，未能恢复外向性特质，缺乏Big Five的心理测量一致性。

Conclusion: Big Five模型具有稳健性，人格的语义结构是情境依赖的；机器学习可以检验已有心理学理论的生态效度，但可能无法替代它们。

Abstract: The lexical hypothesis posits that personality traits are encoded in language
and is foundational to models like the Big Five. We created a bottom-up
personality model from a classic adjective list using machine learning and
compared its descriptive utility against the Big Five by analyzing one million
Reddit comments. The Big Five, particularly Agreeableness, Conscientiousness,
and Neuroticism, provided a far more powerful and interpretable description of
these online communities. In contrast, our machine-learning clusters provided
no meaningful distinctions, failed to recover the Extraversion trait, and
lacked the psychometric coherence of the Big Five. These results affirm the
robustness of the Big Five and suggest personality's semantic structure is
context-dependent. Our findings show that while machine learning can help check
the ecological validity of established psychological theories, it may not be
able to replace them.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: NCAL-R是一个基于神经网络崩溃几何的可靠主动学习框架，通过类均值对齐扰动和特征波动评分来对抗噪声标签和数据分布偏移，在减少标注成本的同时提高模型鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统主动学习方法在标签噪声和数据分布偏移情况下不可靠，因为其启发式方法（不确定性、多样性）往往会放大错误标注或冗余样本的影响。

Method: 提出两个互补信号：类均值对齐扰动评分（量化候选样本对类间几何结构的影响）和特征波动评分（捕捉训练过程中表征的时间不稳定性），结合这些信号来选择既能保持类别分离又能突出模糊区域的样本。

Result: 在ImageNet-100和CIFAR100上的实验表明，NCAL-R始终优于标准主动学习基线，在合成标签噪声下具有更高的准确性和鲁棒性，对分布外数据有更强的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 将几何可靠性标准纳入获取决策可以使主动学习对标注错误和分布偏移更加鲁棒，是实现真实世界标注管道中可信部署的关键步骤。

Abstract: Active Learning (AL) promises to reduce annotation cost by prioritizing
informative samples, yet its reliability is undermined when labels are noisy or
when the data distribution shifts. In practice, annotators make mistakes, rare
categories are ambiguous, and conventional AL heuristics (uncertainty,
diversity) often amplify such errors by repeatedly selecting mislabeled or
redundant samples. We propose Reliable Active Learning via Neural Collapse
Geometry (NCAL-R), a framework that leverages the emergent geometric
regularities of deep networks to counteract unreliable supervision. Our method
introduces two complementary signals: (i) a Class-Mean Alignment Perturbation
score, which quantifies how candidate samples structurally stabilize or distort
inter-class geometry, and (ii) a Feature Fluctuation score, which captures
temporal instability of representations across training checkpoints. By
combining these signals, NCAL-R prioritizes samples that both preserve class
separation and highlight ambiguous regions, mitigating the effect of noisy or
redundant labels. Experiments on ImageNet-100 and CIFAR100 show that NCAL-R
consistently outperforms standard AL baselines, achieving higher accuracy with
fewer labels, improved robustness under synthetic label noise, and stronger
generalization to out-of-distribution data. These results suggest that
incorporating geometric reliability criteria into acquisition decisions can
make Active Learning less brittle to annotation errors and distribution shifts,
a key step toward trustworthy deployment in real-world labeling pipelines. Our
code is available at https://github.com/Vision-IIITD/NCAL.

Abstract: Patent drafting is complex due to its need for detailed technical
descriptions, legal compliance, and visual elements. Although Large Vision
Language Models (LVLMs) show promise across various tasks, their application in
automating patent writing remains underexplored. In this paper, we present
PatentVision, a multimodal framework that integrates textual and visual inputs

Built on advanced LVLMs, PatentVision enhances accuracy by combining fine tuned
vision language models with domain specific training tailored to patents.
Experiments reveal it surpasses text only methods, producing outputs with
greater fidelity and alignment with human written standards. Its incorporation
of visual data allows it to better represent intricate design features and
functional connections, leading to richer and more precise results. This study
underscores the value of multimodal techniques in patent automation, providing
a scalable tool to reduce manual workloads and improve consistency.

Conclusion: ProtoMM能够捕捉跨模态的互补信息，为生理信号提供连贯的"共同语言"，同时提高学习特征的可解释性

Abstract: Modeling multi-modal time-series data is critical for capturing system-level
dynamics, particularly in biosignals where modalities such as ECG, PPG, EDA,
and accelerometry provide complementary perspectives on interconnected
physiological processes. While recent self-supervised learning (SSL) advances
have improved unimodal representation learning, existing multi-modal approaches
often rely on CLIP-style contrastive objectives that overfit to easily aligned
features and misclassify valid cross-modal relationships as negatives,
resulting in fragmented and non-generalizable embeddings. To overcome these
limitations, we propose ProtoMM, a novel SSL framework that introduces a shared
prototype dictionary to anchor heterogeneous modalities in a common embedding
space. By clustering representations around shared prototypes rather than
explicit negative sampling, our method captures complementary information
across modalities and provides a coherent "common language" for physiological
signals. In this work, we focus on developing a Pulse Motion foundation model
with ProtoMM and demonstrate that our approach outperforms contrastive-only and
prior multimodal SSL methods, achieving state-of-the-art performance while
offering improved interpretability of learned features.

Conclusion: HeSRN通过槽感知结构和保留机制有效解决了图Transformer在异构图上的计算效率和语义建模问题，为高效且表达力强的异构图表示学习提供了新方案。

Abstract: Graph Transformers have recently achieved remarkable progress in graph
representation learning by capturing long-range dependencies through
self-attention. However, their quadratic computational complexity and inability
to effectively model heterogeneous semantics severely limit their scalability
and generalization on real-world heterogeneous graphs. To address these issues,
we propose HeSRN, a novel Heterogeneous Slot-aware Retentive Network for
efficient and expressive heterogeneous graph representation learning. HeSRN
introduces a slot-aware structure encoder that explicitly disentangles
node-type semantics by projecting heterogeneous features into independent slots
and aligning their distributions through slot normalization and retention-based
fusion, effectively mitigating the semantic entanglement caused by forced
feature-space unification in previous Transformer-based models. Furthermore, we
replace the self-attention mechanism with a retention-based encoder, which
models structural and contextual dependencies in linear time complexity while
maintaining strong expressive power. A heterogeneous retentive encoder is
further employed to jointly capture both local structural signals and global
heterogeneous semantics through multi-scale retention layers. Extensive
experiments on four real-world heterogeneous graph datasets demonstrate that
HeSRN consistently outperforms state-of-the-art heterogeneous graph neural
networks and Graph Transformer baselines on node classification tasks,
achieving superior accuracy with significantly lower computational complexity.

Motivation: 研究动机是探索在几何任务中，等变性（对称性）对模型缩放性能的影响，特别是随着规模扩大时，等变性架构是否比非等变性模型表现更好。

Method: 采用经验研究方法，在原子间势能学习任务中比较不同架构的缩放行为，分析数据、参数和计算之间的幂律缩放关系。

Result: 发现等变性架构比非等变性模型缩放更好，高阶等变表示对应更优的缩放指数。计算最优训练需要数据和模型大小同步缩放。

Conclusion: 结论是，随着规模扩大，不应让模型自行发现基本归纳偏置（如对称性），因为这些偏置会改变任务的内在难度和缩放规律。

Abstract: We present an empirical study in the geometric task of learning interatomic
potentials, which shows equivariance matters even more at larger scales; we
show a clear power-law scaling behaviour with respect to data, parameters and
compute with ``architecture-dependent exponents''. In particular, we observe
that equivariant architectures, which leverage task symmetry, scale better than
non-equivariant models. Moreover, among equivariant architectures, higher-order
representations translate to better scaling exponents. Our analysis also
suggests that for compute-optimal training, the data and model sizes should
scale in tandem regardless of the architecture. At a high level, these results
suggest that, contrary to common belief, we should not leave it to the model to
discover fundamental inductive biases such as symmetry, especially as we scale,
because they change the inherent difficulty of the task and its scaling laws.

Abstract: Fingerprinting Radio Frequency (RF) emitters typically involves finding
unique emitter characteristics that are featured in their transmitted signals.
These fingerprints are nuanced but sufficiently detailed, motivating the
pursuit of methods that can successfully extract them. The most granular
downstream task is known as Specific Emitter Identification (SEI), which
requires a well informed RF fingerprinting (RFF) approach for it to be
successful. RFF and SEI have a long history, with numerous application areas in
defence and civilian contexts such as signal intelligence, electronic
surveillance, physical-layer authentication of wireless communication devices,
to name a few. RFF methods also support many other downstream tasks such as
Emitter Data Association (EDA) and RF Emitter Clustering (RFEC) and are
applicable to a range of transmission types. In recent years, data-driven
approaches have become popular in the RFF domain due to their ability to
automatically learn intricate fingerprints from raw data. These methods
generally deliver superior performance when compared to traditional techniques.
The more traditional approaches are often labour-intensive, inflexible and only
applicable to a particular emitter type or transmission scheme. Therefore, we
consider data-driven Machine Learning (ML)-enabled RFF. In particular, we
propose a generic framework for ML-enabled RFF which is inclusive of several
popular downstream tasks such as SEI, EDA and RFEC. Each task is formulated as
a RF fingerprint-dependent task. A variety of use cases using real RF datasets
are presented here to demonstrate the framework for a range of tasks and
application areas, such as spaceborne surveillance, signal intelligence and
countering drones.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文从理论角度分析Transformer在时间序列预测中的局限性，证明线性自注意力模型无法超越经典线性模型，并揭示在特定条件下预测会退化到均值。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大语言模型在时间序列预测中应用广泛，但实证显示Transformer往往无法超越简单线性模型。本文旨在从理论层面理解这一现象，填补现有研究的理论空白。

Method: 通过In-Context Learning理论框架，在AR(p)数据假设下，对线性自注意力模型进行理论分析，并通过精心设计的实验进行验证。

Result: 理论证明：(1)线性自注意力模型无法获得比经典线性模型更低的MSE；(2)当上下文长度趋于无穷时，LSA渐近恢复最优线性预测器；(3)在思维链推理下，预测会指数级退化到均值。实验结果验证了这些理论发现。

Conclusion: 揭示了Transformer在时间序列预测中的根本理论限制，为设计更有效的预测架构提供实践洞见，鼓励研究社区重新审视时间序列预测的基本理论限制。

Abstract: Time series forecasting (TSF) remains a challenging and largely unsolved
problem in machine learning, despite significant recent efforts leveraging
Large Language Models (LLMs), which predominantly rely on Transformer
architectures. Empirical evidence consistently shows that even powerful
Transformers often fail to outperform much simpler models, e.g., linear models,
on TSF tasks; however, a rigorous theoretical understanding of this phenomenon
remains limited. In this paper, we provide a theoretical analysis of
Transformers' limitations for TSF through the lens of In-Context Learning (ICL)
theory. Specifically, under AR($p$) data, we establish that: (1) Linear
Self-Attention (LSA) models $\textit{cannot}$ achieve lower expected MSE than
classical linear models for in-context forecasting; (2) as the context length
approaches to infinity, LSA asymptotically recovers the optimal linear
predictor; and (3) under Chain-of-Thought (CoT) style inference, predictions
collapse to the mean exponentially. We empirically validate these findings
through carefully designed experiments. Our theory not only sheds light on
several previously underexplored phenomena but also offers practical insights
for designing more effective forecasting architectures. We hope our work
encourages the broader research community to revisit the fundamental
theoretical limitations of TSF and to critically evaluate the direct
application of increasingly sophisticated architectures without deeper
scrutiny.

Abstract: Time series AI is crucial for analyzing dynamic web content, driving a surge
of pre-trained large models known for their strong knowledge encoding and
transfer capabilities across diverse tasks. However, given their
energy-intensive training, inference, and hardware demands, using large models
as a one-fits-all solution raises serious concerns about carbon footprint and
sustainability. For a specific task, a compact yet specialized, high-performing
model may be more practical and affordable, especially for resource-constrained
users such as small businesses. This motivates the question: Can we build
cost-effective lightweight models with large-model-like performance on core
tasks such as forecasting? This paper addresses this question by introducing
SVTime, a novel Small model inspired by large Vision model (LVM) forecasters
for long-term Time series forecasting (LTSF). Recently, LVMs have been shown as
powerful tools for LTSF. We identify a set of key inductive biases of LVM
forecasters -- analogous to the "physics" governing their behaviors in LTSF --
and design small models that encode these biases through meticulously crafted
linear layers and constraint functions. Across 21 baselines spanning
lightweight, complex, and pre-trained large models on 8 benchmark datasets,
SVTime outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) lightweight models and rivals large
models with 10^3 fewer parameters than LVMs, while enabling efficient training
and inference in low-resource settings.

Motivation: 现有防护机制主要在动作执行后运作，难以扩展且缺乏对计划层面的可控监督，某些风险一旦执行会造成严重后果

Method: AuraGen合成良性轨迹并注入校准难度的风险；Safiron结合跨规划器适配器和紧凑防护模型；Pre-Exec Bench提供多样化工具和分支轨迹的基准

Result: 在Pre-Exec Bench上，提出的防护机制相比强基线获得一致优势，消融实验提炼出可操作实践

Conclusion: 为更安全的智能体系统提供了实用模板，通过填补三大缺口实现预执行阶段的可靠安全防护

Abstract: While LLM agents can plan multi-step tasks, intervening at the planning
stage-before any action is executed-is often the safest way to prevent harm,
since certain risks can lead to severe consequences once carried out. However,
existing guardrails mostly operate post-execution, which is difficult to scale
and leaves little room for controllable supervision at the plan level. To
address this challenge, we highlight three critical gaps in current research:
data gap, model gap, and evaluation gap. To close the data gap, we introduce
AuraGen, a controllable engine that (i) synthesizes benign trajectories, (ii)
injects category-labeled risks with calibrated difficulty, and (iii) filters
outputs via an automated reward model, producing large and reliable corpora for
pre-execution safety. To close the guardian model gap, we propose a
foundational guardrail Safiron, combining a cross-planner adapter with a
compact guardian model. The adapter unifies different input formats, while
Safiron flags risky cases, assigns risk types, and generates rationales;
trained in two stages with a broadly explored data recipe, Safiron achieves
robust transfer across settings. To close the evaluation gap, we release
Pre-Exec Bench, a realistic benchmark covering diverse tools and branching
trajectories, which measures detection, fine-grained categorization,
explanation, and cross-planner generalization in human-verified scenarios.
Extensive experiments demonstrate consistent gains of the proposed guardrail
over strong baselines on Pre-Exec Bench, and ablations further distill
actionable practices, providing a practical template for safer agentic systems.

Motivation: 传统过采样方法如SMOTE需要将分类变量转换为数值向量，导致信息丢失。现有LLM方法生成的少数类样本多样性有限，影响下游分类任务的鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Method: 1) 基于少数类标签和特征的合成样本生成策略；2) 预训练LLM的新排列微调策略；3) 在少数类样本和插值样本上微调LLM以增强变异性。

Conclusion: 该方法通过理论分析和实验验证，证明了其能够有效提升生成样本的多样性，为不平衡分类问题提供了更优的解决方案。

Abstract: Oversampling is one of the most widely used approaches for addressing
imbalanced classification. The core idea is to generate additional minority
samples to rebalance the dataset. Most existing methods, such as SMOTE, require
converting categorical variables into numerical vectors, which often leads to
information loss. Recently, large language model (LLM)-based methods have been
introduced to overcome this limitation. However, current LLM-based approaches
typically generate minority samples with limited diversity, reducing robustness
and generalizability in downstream classification tasks. To address this gap,
we propose a novel LLM-based oversampling method designed to enhance diversity.
First, we introduce a sampling strategy that conditions synthetic sample
generation on both minority labels and features. Second, we develop a new
permutation strategy for fine-tuning pre-trained LLMs. Third, we fine-tune the
LLM not only on minority samples but also on interpolated samples to further
enrich variability. Extensive experiments on 10 tabular datasets demonstrate
that our method significantly outperforms eight SOTA baselines. The generated
synthetic samples are both realistic and diverse. Moreover, we provide
theoretical analysis through an entropy-based perspective, proving that our
method encourages diversity in the generated samples.

Conclusion: D-SPIB提供了一个灵活的架构，能够同时处理表示学习和生成任务，在分子科学中具有应用价值。

Abstract: Generative modeling becomes increasingly data-intensive in high-dimensional
spaces. In molecular science, where data collection is expensive and important
events are rare, compression to lower-dimensional manifolds is especially
important for various downstream tasks, including generation. We combine a
time-lagged information bottleneck designed to characterize molecular important
representations and a diffusion model in one joint training objective. The
resulting protocol, which we term Diffusive State Predictive Information
Bottleneck (D-SPIB), enables the balancing of representation learning and
generation aims in one flexible architecture. Additionally, the model is
capable of combining temperature information from different molecular
simulation trajectories to learn a coherent and useful internal representation
of thermodynamics. We benchmark D-SPIB on multiple molecular tasks and showcase
its potential for exploring physical conditions outside the training set.

Abstract: Neural operators are becoming the default tools to learn solutions to
governing partial differential equations (PDEs) in weather and ocean
forecasting applications. Despite early promising achievements, significant
challenges remain, including long-term prediction stability and adherence to
physical laws, particularly for high-frequency processes. In this paper, we
take a step toward addressing these challenges in high-resolution ocean
prediction by incorporating temporal Fourier modes, demonstrating how this
modification enhances physical fidelity. This study compares the standard
Fourier Neural Operator (FNO) with its variant, FNOtD, which has been modified
to internalize the dispersion relation while learning the solution operator for
ocean PDEs. The results demonstrate that entangling space and time in the
training of integral kernels enables the model to capture multiscale wave
propagation and effectively learn ocean dynamics. FNOtD substantially improves
long-term prediction stability and consistency with underlying physical
dynamics in challenging high-frequency settings compared to the standard FNO.
It also provides competitive predictive skill relative to a state-of-the-art
numerical ocean model, while requiring significantly lower computational cost.

Motivation: 研究神经网络内部机制解释性中的两个常被混淆的概念——可解码性（从隐藏状态恢复信息的能力）和因果性（这些状态对输出的功能影响程度）之间的关系。

Method: 使用激活修补技术在视觉变换器（ViTs）中测试空间和CLS标记的因果作用，同时训练线性探针评估不同深度下计数信息的可解码性。

Result: 发现中间层对象标记具有强因果影响但可解码性弱，最终层对象标记可解码性强但因果影响弱；CLS标记在中间层变得可解码但仅在最终层获得因果能力。

Conclusion: 可解码性和因果性反映了表征的互补维度——存在什么信息与使用什么信息——它们的分歧可以揭示隐藏的计算电路。

Abstract: Mechanistic interpretability seeks to uncover how internal components of
neural networks give rise to predictions. A persistent challenge, however, is
disentangling two often conflated notions: decodability--the recoverability of
information from hidden states--and causality--the extent to which those states
functionally influence outputs. In this work, we investigate their relationship
in vision transformers (ViTs) fine-tuned for object counting. Using activation
patching, we test the causal role of spatial and CLS tokens by transplanting
activations across clean-corrupted image pairs. In parallel, we train linear
probes to assess the decodability of count information at different depths. Our
results reveal systematic mismatches: middle-layer object tokens exert strong
causal influence despite being weakly decodable, whereas final-layer object
tokens support accurate decoding yet are functionally inert. Similarly, the CLS
token becomes decodable in mid-layers but only acquires causal power in the
final layers. These findings highlight that decodability and causality reflect
complementary dimensions of representation--what information is present versus
what is used--and that their divergence can expose hidden computational
circuits.

Motivation: 传统基于梯度的优化和反向传播方法面临梯度消失/爆炸、非光滑激活函数处理困难以及顺序结构限制并行化等问题，需要替代的训练方法。

Method: 将嵌套优化问题转化为高维约束优化问题，使用惩罚项替代直接约束，整合多种提升训练策略（辅助坐标法、Fenchel提升网络、提升Bregman训练），应用块坐标下降策略和Bregman距离等凸优化工具。

Result: 数值实验验证了提升Bregman方法在标准成像任务中的有效性和稳定性，特别是在使用近端激活函数的架构中优于传统训练方法。

Conclusion: 提升训练框架为深度神经网络训练提供了有效的替代方案，能够改善训练景观条件，支持分布式优化，并处理非可微近端激活函数。

Abstract: The training of deep neural networks predominantly relies on a combination of
gradient-based optimisation and back-propagation for the computation of the
gradient. While incredibly successful, this approach faces challenges such as
vanishing or exploding gradients, difficulties with non-smooth activations, and
an inherently sequential structure that limits parallelisation. Lifted training
methods offer an alternative by reformulating the nested optimisation problem
into a higher-dimensional, constrained optimisation problem where the
constraints are no longer enforced directly but penalised with penalty terms.
This chapter introduces a unified framework that encapsulates various lifted
training strategies, including the Method of Auxiliary Coordinates, Fenchel
Lifted Networks, and Lifted Bregman Training, and demonstrates how diverse
architectures, such as Multi-Layer Perceptrons, Residual Neural Networks, and
Proximal Neural Networks fit within this structure. By leveraging tools from
convex optimisation, particularly Bregman distances, the framework facilitates
distributed optimisation, accommodates non-differentiable proximal activations,
and can improve the conditioning of the training landscape. We discuss the
implementation of these methods using block-coordinate descent strategies,
including deterministic implementations enhanced by accelerated and adaptive
optimisation techniques, as well as implicit stochastic gradient methods.
Furthermore, we explore the application of this framework to inverse problems,
detailing methodologies for both the training of specialised networks (e.g.,
unrolled architectures) and the stable inversion of pre-trained networks.
Numerical results on standard imaging tasks validate the effectiveness and
stability of the lifted Bregman approach compared to conventional training,
particularly for architectures employing proximal activations.

Conclusion: 时间提升框架将解析正则性理论与表示学习方法联系起来，适用于刚性或湍流过程。

Abstract: We present a latent-space formulation of adaptive temporal reparametrization
for continuous-time dynamical systems. The method, called *temporal lifting*,
introduces a smooth monotone mapping $t \mapsto \tau(t)$ that regularizes
near-singular behavior of the underlying flow while preserving its conservation
laws. In the lifted coordinate, trajectories such as those of the
incompressible Navier-Stokes equations on the torus $\mathbb{T}^3$ become
globally smooth. From the standpoint of machine-learning dynamics, temporal
lifting acts as a continuous-time normalization or time-warping operator that
can stabilize physics-informed neural networks and other latent-flow
architectures used in AI systems. The framework links analytic regularity
theory with representation-learning methods for stiff or turbulent processes.

Motivation: 传统自编码器将输入压缩为单一潜在表示，而DecompNet旨在分解输入为多个可解释的语义组件，提供更丰富的表示。

Conclusion: 该方法在线性分解方法、深度展开优化和面向对象架构中具有新颖性，为语义分解提供了新思路。

Abstract: We propose the Decomposer Networks (DecompNet), a semantic autoencoder that
factorizes an input into multiple interpretable components. Unlike classical
autoencoders that compress an input into a single latent representation, the
Decomposer Network maintains N parallel branches, each assigned a residual
input defined as the original signal minus the reconstructions of all other
branches. By unrolling a Gauss--Seidel style block-coordinate descent into a
differentiable network, DecompNet enforce explicit competition among
components, yielding parsimonious, semantically meaningful representations. We
situate our model relative to linear decomposition methods (PCA, NMF), deep
unrolled optimization, and object-centric architectures (MONet, IODINE, Slot
Attention), and highlight its novelty as the first semantic autoencoder to
implement an all-but-one residual update rule.

Motivation: 为了在神经网络中定义最速下降方法，需要为每层选择规范、跨层聚合规范的方式以及是否使用归一化。现有方法如Adam和新提出的Muon优化器存在超参数敏感性等问题。

Method: 系统探索跨层规范聚合的不同替代方案，将Adam和Muon形式化为非欧几里得梯度下降类型，推导出新的Muon优化器变体，并将非欧几里得梯度方法与模型动量(Momo)结合。

Result: 实验发现Muon对学习率选择敏感，而新提出的MuonMax变体显著更鲁棒。与Momo结合的Muon变体对超参数调整更鲁棒，通常获得更好的验证分数。

Conclusion: 对于新任务，当最优超参数未知时，建议使用Momo与MuonMax组合，以节省昂贵的超参数调整成本。

Abstract: To define a steepest descent method over a neural network, we need to choose
a norm for each layer, a way to aggregate these norms across layers, and
whether to use normalization. We systematically explore different alternatives
for aggregating norms across layers, both formalizing existing combinations of
Adam and the recently proposed Muon as a type of non-Euclidean gradient
descent, and deriving new variants of the Muon optimizer. Through a
comprehensive experimental evaluation of the optimizers within our framework,
we find that Muon is sensitive to the choice of learning rate, whereas a new
variant we call MuonMax is significantly more robust. We then show how to
combine any non-Euclidean gradient method with model based momentum (known as
Momo). The new Momo variants of Muon are significantly more robust to
hyperparameter tuning, and often achieve a better validation score. Thus for
new tasks, where the optimal hyperparameters are not known, we advocate for
using Momo in combination with MuonMax to save on costly hyperparameter tuning.

Abstract: Causal discovery from observational data is fundamental to scientific fields
like biology, where controlled experiments are often impractical. However,
existing methods, including constraint-based (e.g., PC, causalMGM) and
score-based approaches (e.g., NOTEARS), face significant limitations. These
include an inability to resolve causal direction, restrictions to linear
associations, sensitivity to violations of the faithfulness assumption, and
inefficiency in searching vast hypothesis spaces. While large language models
(LLMs) offer powerful reasoning capabilities, their application is hindered by
a fundamental discrepancy: they are designed for text, while most causal data
is tabular. To address these challenges, we introduce CALM, a novel causal
analysis language model specifically designed for tabular data in complex
systems. CALM leverages a Mamba-based architecture to classify causal patterns
from pairwise variable relationships. It integrates a comprehensive suite of
evidence, including local causal scores, conditional independence tests, and
relational attributes, to capture a wide spectrum of linear, nonlinear, and
conditional causal mechanisms. Trained on a diverse corpus of synthetic data
(from linear, mixed, and nonlinear models) and 10 real-world biological
datasets with rigorously validated causal relationships, our model ensures
robustness and generalizability. Empirical evaluation demonstrates that CALM
significantly outperforms existing methods in both simulation studies,
achieving over 91% accuracy, and in a real-world application identifying causal
factors in Hepatitis C virus progression. This work represents a significant
step towards accurate and generalizable causal discovery by successfully
adapting the pattern recognition capabilities of language models to the
intricacies of tabular data.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) query routers are critical to modern AI platforms
as they seek to improve efficiency by assigning inference queries to accurate,
yet low-cost models. Parametric routers typically use trained neural networks
for LLM selection but suffer from retraining and maintenance overheads.
Nonparametric routers are training-free, instead estimating LLM accuracy and
cost via similarity between encodings of the input query and training set
queries. However, like their parametric counterparts, nonparametric routers
struggle to generalize to outlier queries, an issue exacerbated by limited
diversity in training sets which are costly to expand and difficult to keep
current with ever-evolving use cases. We propose ProxRouter, which applies an
exponentially tilted aggregation mechanism to balance bias and variance in
nonparametric routers, improving their robustness to outliers. Experiments show
ProxRouter enhances outlier routing while preserving inlier performance with
minimal overhead.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: WARC-Bench是一个新的网页导航基准测试，包含438个任务，专注于评估多模态AI代理在网页子任务上的表现。实验表明现有模型在该基准上表现不佳，最高成功率仅64.8%。通过监督微调和强化学习训练，模型性能可提升至52.8%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有网页导航基准未能充分评估AI代理在网页子任务（如日期选择器操作、容器滚动等短时交互）上的能力，而这些子任务对于在复杂真实网站上的稳健导航至关重要。

Method: 使用Web ARChive文件创建沙盒环境进行动态网页交互，并探索两种训练技术：监督微调(SFT)和基于可验证奖励的强化学习(RLVR)。

Result: 领先的计算机使用模型在WARC-Bench上的最高成功率仅为64.8%。经过SFT训练的模型达到48.8%成功率，而SFT+RLVR组合训练在数据稀缺环境下将成功率提升至52.8%，超越了许多前沿模型。

Conclusion: 掌握网页子任务对于稳健的网页规划和导航至关重要，这是现有基准测试未能充分评估的能力。WARC-Bench为评估和改进AI代理的网页交互能力提供了重要工具。

Abstract: Training web agents to navigate complex, real-world websites requires them to
master $\textit{subtasks}$ - short-horizon interactions on multiple UI
components (e.g., choosing the correct date in a date picker, or scrolling in a
container to extract information). We introduce WARC-Bench (Web Archive
Benchmark), a novel web navigation benchmark featuring 438 tasks designed to
evaluate multimodal AI agents on subtasks. WARC-Bench enables sandboxed
interactions with dynamic and realistic webpages using Web ARChive files. We
show that WARC-Bench is challenging for leading computer-use models, with the
highest observed success rate being 64.8%. To improve open source models on
subtask, we explore two common training techniques: supervised fine-tuning
(SFT) and reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR). Experiments
show that SFT models obtain a 48.8% success rate on the benchmark. Training
with RLVR over SFT checkpoints, even in data-scarce settings, improves the
score to 52.8% on WARC-Bench, outperforming many frontier models. Our analysis
concludes that mastering these subtasks is essential for robust web planning
and navigation, and is a capability not extensively evaluated by existing
benchmarks.

TL;DR: 本文基于贝叶斯决策理论推导了主动学习算法，提出了ParBaLS方法来解决批量采样中的扩展性问题，并在多个数据集上验证了其优越性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的主动学习获取函数众多，但缺乏统一的理论指导，且在大批量采样时面临计算挑战或性能下降问题。

Method: 基于贝叶斯决策理论推导主动学习算法，包括EER、EPIG等，并提出ParBaLS方法来解决EPIG算法在大批量采样时的扩展性问题。

Result: 实验表明，ParBaLS EPIG在多个数据集上对于固定预算和贝叶斯逻辑回归在神经网络嵌入上提供了优越的性能。

Conclusion: 贝叶斯决策理论为主动学习提供了统一的理论框架，ParBaLS方法有效解决了批量采样中的扩展性问题，具有实用价值。

Abstract: Over the past couple of decades, many active learning acquisition functions
have been proposed, leaving practitioners with an unclear choice of which to
use. Bayesian Decision Theory (BDT) offers a universal principle to guide
decision-making. In this work, we derive BDT for (Bayesian) active learning in
the myopic framework, where we imagine we only have one more point to label.
This derivation leads to effective algorithms such as Expected Error Reduction
(EER), Expected Predictive Information Gain (EPIG), and other algorithms that
appear in the literature. Furthermore, we show that BAIT (active learning based
on V-optimal experimental design) can be derived from BDT and asymptotic
approximations. A key challenge of such methods is the difficult scaling to
large batch sizes, leading to either computational challenges (BatchBALD) or
dramatic performance drops (top-$B$ selection). Here, using a particular
formulation of the decision process, we derive Partial Batch Label Sampling
(ParBaLS) for the EPIG algorithm. We show experimentally for several datasets
that ParBaLS EPIG gives superior performance for a fixed budget and Bayesian
Logistic Regression on Neural Embeddings. Our code is available at

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TAWRMAC是一个新颖的动态图表示学习框架，通过整合时间匿名游走、内存增强和邻居共现嵌入，解决了现有方法在嵌入稳定性、邻居相关性和结构动态捕捉方面的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有连续时间动态图学习方法面临三个关键挑战：节点特定内存依赖导致嵌入过时、未能显式捕捉邻居节点间相关性、无法充分捕捉演化图的结构动态。

Method: 提出TAWRMAC框架，整合时间匿名游走重启机制、内存增强的图神经网络和邻居共现嵌入，通过固定时间编码增强嵌入稳定性，显式捕捉邻居相关性，区分重复交互和新建连接。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上的实验表明，TAWRMAC在动态链接预测和节点分类任务中，在转导和归纳设置下均优于现有最先进方法，且对三种不同负采样策略都表现一致。

Conclusion: TAWRMAC通过提供稳定、可泛化和上下文感知的嵌入，推进了连续时间动态图学习的技术水平。

Abstract: Dynamic graph representation learning has become essential for analyzing
evolving networks in domains such as social network analysis, recommendation
systems, and traffic analysis. However, existing continuous-time methods face
three key challenges: (1) some methods depend solely on node-specific memory
without effectively incorporating information from neighboring nodes, resulting
in embedding staleness; (2) most fail to explicitly capture correlations
between node neighborhoods, limiting contextual awareness; and (3) many fail to
fully capture the structural dynamics of evolving graphs, especially in absence
of rich link attributes. To address these limitations, we introduce TAWRMAC-a
novel framework that integrates Temporal Anonymous Walks with Restart, Memory
Augmentation, and Neighbor Co-occurrence embedding. TAWRMAC enhances embedding
stability through a memory-augmented GNN with fixedtime encoding and improves
contextual representation by explicitly capturing neighbor correlations.
Additionally, its Temporal Anonymous Walks with Restart mechanism distinguishes
between nodes exhibiting repetitive interactions and those forming new
connections beyond their immediate neighborhood. This approach captures
structural dynamics better and supports strong inductive learning. Extensive
experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that TAWRMAC
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in dynamic link prediction
and node classification under both transductive and inductive settings across
three different negative sampling strategies. By providing stable,
generalizable, and context-aware embeddings, TAWRMAC advances the state of the
art in continuous-time dynamic graph learning. The code is available at

### [61] [Understanding Robust Machine Learning for Nonparametric Regression with Heavy-Tailed Noise](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09888)
*Yunlong Feng,Qiang Wu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文研究了在重尾噪声存在下的鲁棒非参数回归，提出使用预测误差而非泛化误差来评估学习性能，并建立了新的比较定理和有限样本误差界。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统鲁棒学习的泛化误差界不能准确反映样本外性能，且在无界函数空间和重尾噪声下，标准浓度工具失效，需要新的分析框架。

Method: 使用Tikhonov正则化风险最小化在再生核希尔伯特空间中，引入概率有效假设空间，建立鲁棒风险与L2预测误差的比较定理。

Result: 建立了新的比较定理，将超额鲁棒风险与L2预测误差联系起来，推导出Huber回归在RKHS中的显式有限样本误差界和收敛速率。

Conclusion: 预测误差而非超额泛化风险是分析鲁棒学习的基本视角，研究提供了原则性的调参规则，并适用于Huber以外的其他鲁棒损失函数。

Abstract: We investigate robust nonparametric regression in the presence of
heavy-tailed noise, where the hypothesis class may contain unbounded functions
and robustness is ensured via a robust loss function $\ell_\sigma$. Using Huber
regression as a close-up example within Tikhonov-regularized risk minimization
in reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (RKHS), we address two central challenges:
(i) the breakdown of standard concentration tools under weak moment
assumptions, and (ii) the analytical difficulties introduced by unbounded
hypothesis spaces. Our first message is conceptual: conventional
generalization-error bounds for robust losses do not faithfully capture
out-of-sample performance. We argue that learnability should instead be
quantified through prediction error, namely the $L_2$-distance to the truth
$f^\star$, which is $\sigma$-independent and directly reflects the target of
robust estimation. To make this workable under unboundedness, we introduce a
\emph{probabilistic effective hypothesis space} that confines the estimator
with high probability and enables a meaningful bias--variance decomposition
under weak $(1+\epsilon)$-moment conditions. Technically, we establish new
comparison theorems linking the excess robust risk to the $L_2$ prediction
error up to a residual of order $\mathcal{O}(\sigma^{-2\epsilon})$, clarifying
the robustness--bias trade-off induced by the scale parameter $\sigma$.
Building on this, we derive explicit finite-sample error bounds and convergence
rates for Huber regression in RKHS that hold without uniform boundedness and
under heavy-tailed noise. Our study delivers principled tuning rules, extends
beyond Huber to other robust losses, and highlights prediction error, not
excess generalization risk, as the fundamental lens for analyzing robust
learning.

*Parsa Gooya,Reinel Sospedra-Alfonso*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出基于条件变分自编码器的概率误差校正框架，用于北极海冰浓度的季节性预测，能够生成大量调整后的预测集合，改善预测校准度和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统季节性预测系统存在系统性偏差和复杂时空误差，确定性后处理方法无法充分量化不确定性，而决策制定需要适当的概率信息特别是极端事件的可能性。

Method: 使用条件变分自编码器模型，建立观测数据给定有偏模型预测的条件分布映射，自然生成大量调整后的预测集合。

Result: 调整后的预测在校准度、观测分布接近度和误差方面均优于气候平均调整预测，在确定性和概率性指标上表现更好。

Conclusion: 该概率误差校正框架能够有效改善北极海冰浓度季节性预测的质量，为决策提供更可靠的不确定性量化。

Abstract: Seasonal forecast of Arctic sea ice concentration is key to mitigate the
negative impact and assess potential opportunities posed by the rapid decline
of sea ice coverage. Seasonal prediction systems based on climate models often
show systematic biases and complex spatio-temporal errors that grow with the
forecasts. Consequently, operational predictions are routinely bias corrected
and calibrated using retrospective forecasts. For predictions of Arctic sea ice
concentration, error corrections are mainly based on one-to-one post-processing
methods including climatological mean or linear regression correction and, more
recently, machine learning. Such deterministic adjustments are confined at best
to the limited number of costly-to-run ensemble members of the raw forecast.
However, decision-making requires proper quantification of uncertainty and
likelihood of events, particularly of extremes. We introduce a probabilistic
error correction framework based on a conditional Variational Autoencoder model
to map the conditional distribution of observations given the biased model
prediction. This method naturally allows for generating large ensembles of
adjusted forecasts. We evaluate our model using deterministic and probabilistic
metrics and show that the adjusted forecasts are better calibrated, closer to
the observational distribution, and have smaller errors than climatological
mean adjusted forecasts.

*Yubo Li,Rema Padman*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了Chain-of-Influence (CoI)框架，通过构建显式的、时间展开的特征交互图来建模临床时间序列数据中的潜在依赖关系，提供可解释的预测结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法无法明确建模临床变量之间随时间变化的相互影响关系，缺乏对特征交互传播机制的可解释性。

Method: 使用多级注意力架构：时间注意力层识别关键时间点，跨特征注意力层建模这些时间点上特征对后续特征的定向影响，构建影响路径图。

Result: 在MIMIC-IV数据集和慢性肾病队列上的死亡率与疾病进展预测任务中，CoI显著优于现有方法，并能揭示具有临床意义的患者特异性疾病进展模式。

Conclusion: CoI框架不仅提高了预测准确性，更重要的是提供了前所未有的透明度，能够追踪任何特征在任何时间点对最终预测的直接影响和通过其他变量的间接影响。

Abstract: Modeling clinical time-series data is hampered by the challenge of capturing
latent, time-varying dependencies among features. State-of-the-art approaches
often rely on black-box mechanisms or simple aggregation, failing to explicitly
model how the influence of one clinical variable propagates through others over
time. We propose $\textbf{Chain-of-Influence (CoI)}$, an interpretable deep
learning framework that constructs an explicit, time-unfolded graph of feature
interactions. CoI leverages a multi-level attention architecture: first, a
temporal attention layer identifies critical time points in a patient's record;
second, a cross-feature attention layer models the directed influence from
features at these time points to subsequent features. This design enables the
tracing of influence pathways, providing a granular audit trail that shows how
any feature at any time contributes to the final prediction, both directly and
through its influence on other variables. We evaluate CoI on mortality and
disease progression tasks using the MIMIC-IV dataset and a private chronic
kidney disease cohort. Our framework significantly outperforms existing methods
in predictive accuracy. More importantly, through case studies, we show that
CoI can uncover clinically meaningful, patient-specific patterns of disease
progression that are opaque to other models, offering unprecedented
transparency into the temporal and cross-feature dependencies that inform
clinical decision-making.

*Hung Phan,Son Le Vu,Ali Jannesari*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: T2J是一个提示增强框架，通过构建包含常见错误修复的增强提示，显著提升LLM在PyTorch到JAX代码翻译中的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PyTorch和JAX虽然都嵌入在Python中，但在核心设计、执行语义和生态系统成熟度上存在差异。JAX较新且公开代码相对较少，平行PyTorch-JAX语料库有限，现有评估方法在跨框架基准测试中存在不足。

Method: 构建两阶段流程：(1) 使用GPT-4o-mini从TorchLeet和CodeParrot数据集中生成初始JAX草稿；(2) 专业开发者迭代修复草稿，构建包含常见错误和补丁的固定错误数据集；(3) 基于这些修复构建增强提示来指导轻量级LLM。

Result: T2J将GPT-4o-mini在CodeBLEU上的性能提升高达10%，T2J FixCost Score提升50%，T2J CodeTrans Score提升1.33分（0-4分制），T2J Comparison Score提升100%。生成的代码运行速度比基线快2.5倍。

Conclusion: T2J框架通过结构化指导和错误修复知识注入，有效解决了PyTorch到JAX代码翻译的挑战，显著提升了翻译质量和效率。

Abstract: Despite recent progress of large language models (LLMs) on code translation
among mainstream languages, translating PyTorch to JAX remains nontrivial. The
two libraries, though both embedded in Python, differ in core design, execution
semantics, and ecosystem maturity; JAX is newer and comparatively
underrepresented in public code, and parallel PyTorch--JAX corpora are limited.
Weaknesses in existing evaluation further complicate cross-framework
benchmarking. We present T2J, a prompt-augmentation framework that strengthens
LLM-based PyTorch to JAX translation. Our pipeline (i) assembles two PyTorch
sources -- the problem-solving set from TorchLeet (Aroori & Chien, 2025) and a
GitHub-derived set from CodeParrot (Wolf et al., 2022) -- and uses GPT-4o-mini
to produce initial JAX drafts; (ii) engages two professional developers to
iteratively repair those drafts until functional equivalence, yielding a
curated fixed-bug dataset of common errors and patches; and (iii) constructs
augmented prompts that inject structured guidance from these fixes to steer
lightweight LLMs (e.g., GPT-4o-mini). We also introduce three metrics tailored
to PyTorch to JAX: T2J CodeTrans Score, T2J FixCost Score (an LLM-based
estimate of bug-fix effort), and T2J Comparison Score (LLM-as-judge).
Empirically, T2J raises GPT-4o-mini performance by up to 10% on CodeBLEU, 50%
on T2J FixCost Score, 1.33 points on T2J CodeTrans Score (0--4 scale), and 100%
on T2J Comparison Score; moreover, the generated code runs up to 2.5x faster
than the baseline.

TL;DR: 本文对Transformer中Layer Normalization的不同放置位置进行了系统性研究，分析了前向和后向稳定性，为训练动态提供了理论指导。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管Transformer被广泛使用，但其训练过程不稳定。Layer Normalization作为标准组件能改善训练稳定性，但其放置位置往往缺乏理论依据。

Method: 通过理论分析不同Layer Normalization放置位置下的前向（隐藏状态）和后向（梯度）稳定性，推导隐藏状态增长的显式边界，分析梯度反向传播的影响。

Result: 理论分析揭示了不同Layer Normalization放置对训练动态的影响，指导了Transformer块中残差步长的缩放选择，数值结果验证了理论发现。

Conclusion: 该框架为检查新架构修改下Transformer的稳定性提供了原则性方法，为未来设计提供了指导。

Abstract: Despite their widespread use, training deep Transformers can be unstable.
Layer normalization, a standard component, improves training stability, but its
placement has often been ad-hoc. In this paper, we conduct a principled study
on the forward (hidden states) and backward (gradient) stability of
Transformers under different layer normalization placements. Our theory
provides key insights into the training dynamics: whether training drives
Transformers toward regular solutions or pathological behaviors. For forward
stability, we derive explicit bounds on the growth of hidden states in trained
Transformers. For backward stability, we analyze how layer normalization
affects the backpropagation of gradients, thereby explaining the training
dynamics of each layer normalization placement. Our analysis also guides the
scaling of residual steps in Transformer blocks, where appropriate choices can
further improve stability and performance. Our numerical results corroborate
our theoretical findings. Beyond these results, our framework provides a
principled way to sanity-check the stability of Transformers under new
architectural modifications, offering guidance for future designs.

Abstract: Recent breakthroughs in generative modeling have demonstrated remarkable
capabilities in molecular generation, yet the integration of comprehensive
biomedical knowledge into these models has remained an untapped frontier. In
this study, we introduce K-DREAM (Knowledge-Driven Embedding-Augmented Model),
a novel framework that leverages knowledge graphs to augment diffusion-based
generative models for drug discovery. By embedding structured information from
large-scale knowledge graphs, K-DREAM directs molecular generation toward
candidates with higher biological relevance and therapeutic suitability. This
integration ensures that the generated molecules are aligned with specific
therapeutic targets, moving beyond traditional heuristic-driven approaches. In
targeted drug design tasks, K-DREAM generates drug candidates with improved
binding affinities and predicted efficacy, surpassing current state-of-the-art
generative models. It also demonstrates flexibility by producing molecules
designed for multiple targets, enabling applications to complex disease
mechanisms. These results highlight the utility of knowledge-enhanced
generative models in rational drug design and their relevance to practical
therapeutic development.

healthier drinking habits, we introduce a groundbreaking mobile smartwatch
application approach to just-in-time interventions for intoxication warnings.
In this work, we have created a dataset gathering TAC, accelerometer,
gyroscope, and heart rate data from the participants during a period of three

Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (bi-LSTM), Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU),
One-Dimensional Convolutional Neural Networks (1D-CNN), and Hyperdimensional

TL;DR: AutoGD是一种自动调整学习率的梯度下降方法，无需用户手动调参，能够自动决定何时增加或减少学习率，并在多种优化任务中表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 梯度下降等优化方法的性能严重依赖学习率的选择，但手动调整学习率需要大量用户调参工作，特别是在作为其他算法内循环时，期望用户调整学习率可能不切实际。

Method: 提出AutoGD方法，自动判断在给定迭代时是增加还是减少学习率，无需了解平滑度常数，并扩展到AutoBFGS和AutoLBFGS。

Result: 建立了AutoGD的收敛性，证明对于广泛函数类可以恢复GD的最优速率（最多相差一个常数），在传统问题和变分推断优化任务上的实验显示了方法的强大性能。

Conclusion: AutoGD提供了一种自动调整学习率的有效方法，无需手动调参，在各种优化任务中表现出色，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: The performance of gradient-based optimization methods, such as standard
gradient descent (GD), greatly depends on the choice of learning rate. However,
it can require a non-trivial amount of user tuning effort to select an
appropriate learning rate schedule. When such methods appear as inner loops of
other algorithms, expecting the user to tune the learning rates may be
impractical. To address this, we introduce AutoGD: a gradient descent method
that automatically determines whether to increase or decrease the learning rate
at a given iteration. We establish the convergence of AutoGD, and show that we
can recover the optimal rate of GD (up to a constant) for a broad class of
functions without knowledge of smoothness constants. Experiments on a variety
of traditional problems and variational inference optimization tasks
demonstrate strong performance of the method, along with its extensions to
AutoBFGS and AutoLBFGS.

TL;DR: 该研究探索了复数卷积神经网络在音频信号处理中的应用，重点研究如何保留和利用实值网络中常被忽略的相位信息。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统实值神经网络在处理音频信号时往往忽略相位信息，而复数神经网络能够更好地保留和利用这一重要特征。

Method: 提出复数卷积神经网络框架，包括复数卷积、池化层、Wirtinger微分和复数激活函数，并采用复数批归一化和权重初始化技术确保训练稳定性。通过三个阶段进行实证评估：图像数据集基准测试、基于MFCC的音频分类、以及引入图神经网络建模相位信息。

Result: CVCNNs在图像数据集上表现与实值CNN相当；在音频分类中，基于实值MFCC的CVCNNs略优于实值CNN；通过GNN建模相位信息在音乐流派分类中获得了可测量的性能提升。

Conclusion: 复数架构具有强大的表达能力，相位是音频处理中有意义且可利用的特征。虽然当前方法（特别是cardioid激活函数）显示出潜力，但未来需要进一步开发相位感知设计来充分发挥复数表示在神经网络中的潜力。

Abstract: This study explores the design and application of Complex-Valued
Convolutional Neural Networks (CVCNNs) in audio signal processing, with a focus
on preserving and utilizing phase information often neglected in real-valued
networks. We begin by presenting the foundational theoretical concepts of
CVCNNs, including complex convolutions, pooling layers, Wirtinger-based
differentiation, and various complex-valued activation functions. These are
complemented by critical adaptations of training techniques, including complex
batch normalization and weight initialization schemes, to ensure stability in
training dynamics. Empirical evaluations are conducted across three stages.
First, CVCNNs are benchmarked on standard image datasets, where they
demonstrate competitive performance with real-valued CNNs, even under synthetic
complex perturbations. Although our focus is audio signal processing, we first
evaluate CVCNNs on image datasets to establish baseline performance and
validate training stability before applying them to audio tasks. In the second
experiment, we focus on audio classification using Mel-Frequency Cepstral
Coefficients (MFCCs). CVCNNs trained on real-valued MFCCs slightly outperform
real CNNs, while preserving phase in input workflows highlights challenges in
exploiting phase without architectural modifications. Finally, a third
experiment introduces GNNs to model phase information via edge weighting, where
the inclusion of phase yields measurable gains in both binary and multi-class
genre classification. These results underscore the expressive capacity of
complex-valued architectures and confirm phase as a meaningful and exploitable
feature in audio processing applications. While current methods show promise,
especially with activations like cardioid, future advances in phase-aware
design will be essential to leverage the potential of complex representations
in neural networks.

TL;DR: MemPromptTSS是一个用于多粒度时间序列分割的框架，通过引入持久提示记忆来解决现有方法中提示影响快速衰减的问题，在单次和多次迭代推理中都显著提升了分割精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有时间序列分割的提示方法仅在局部上下文中操作，提示的影响会快速消失，无法在整个序列中指导预测。需要一种能够使提示影响持久化的机制来支持跨整个序列的迭代细化。

Method: 提出MemPromptTSS框架，引入持久提示记忆。通过记忆编码器将提示及其周围子序列转换为存储在记忆库中的记忆标记，使每个新预测不仅基于局部线索，还能基于所有迭代中积累的提示。

Result: 在6个数据集上的实验显示，MemPromptTSS在单次迭代推理的单粒度和多粒度分割中分别比最佳基线提高23%和85%的准确率，在迭代推理中平均每次迭代增益为2.66个百分点，优于PromptTSS的1.19。

Conclusion: 持久记忆对于提示引导的分割至关重要，MemPromptTSS为实际应用提供了一个实用有效的框架。

Abstract: Web platforms, mobile applications, and connected sensing systems generate
multivariate time series with states at multiple levels of granularity, from
coarse regimes to fine-grained events. Effective segmentation in these settings
requires integrating across granularities while supporting iterative refinement
through sparse prompt signals, which provide a compact mechanism for injecting
domain knowledge. Yet existing prompting approaches for time series
segmentation operate only within local contexts, so the effect of a prompt
quickly fades and cannot guide predictions across the entire sequence. To
overcome this limitation, we propose MemPromptTSS, a framework for iterative
multi-granularity segmentation that introduces persistent prompt memory. A
memory encoder transforms prompts and their surrounding subsequences into
memory tokens stored in a bank. This persistent memory enables each new
prediction to condition not only on local cues but also on all prompts
accumulated across iterations, ensuring their influence persists across the
entire sequence. Experiments on six datasets covering wearable sensing and
industrial monitoring show that MemPromptTSS achieves 23% and 85% accuracy
improvements over the best baseline in single- and multi-granularity
segmentation under single iteration inference, and provides stronger refinement
in iterative inference with average per-iteration gains of 2.66 percentage
points compared to 1.19 for PromptTSS. These results highlight the importance
of persistent memory for prompt-guided segmentation, establishing MemPromptTSS
as a practical and effective framework for real-world applications.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出SQS-SD框架，通过结构化稀疏化和基于格子的量化来压缩边缘设备生成的草稿令牌分布，以解决边缘-云推测解码中的带宽瓶颈问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 边缘-云推测解码面临边缘-云链路带宽有限的问题，需要高效压缩草稿令牌分布。

Method: 提出SQS-SD框架，包含K-SQS（固定top-K截断）和C-SQS（通过在线符合预测自适应调整保留令牌集）两种方法。

Result: 实证结果表明两种方法在互补的操作机制下都能改善端到端延迟和拒绝率。

Conclusion: 基于信息论分析提出的SQS-SD框架有效解决了边缘-云推测解码中的带宽限制问题。

Abstract: Edge-cloud speculative decoding (SD) accelerates inference by having a
cloud-based large language model (LLM) that verifies draft tokens generated by
a resource-constrained small language model (SLM) at the edge. A central
bottleneck is the limited bandwidth of the edge-cloud link, which necessitates
efficient compression of draft token distributions. We first derive an
information-theoretic bound that decomposes the token rejection rate into
contributions from SLM-LLM distribution mismatch and from quantization
distortion. Guided by this analysis, we propose the Sparse Quantize-and-Sample
SD (SQS-SD) framework, which exploits distributional sparsity through
structured sparsification and lattice-based quantization. Within this
framework, K-SQS applies fixed top-K truncation, while C-SQS adaptively adjusts
the retained token set via online conformal prediction to ensure bounded
deviation from the dense distribution. Empirical results confirm that both
approaches improve end-to-end latency and rejection rates in complimentary
operating regimes.

<details>

Motivation: 传统不完备多视图谱聚类需要K-means后处理，且未有效利用样本连通性信息。

Method: 施加非负约束直接提取聚类结果，基于谱聚类结果构建连通性矩阵，使用乘法更新迭代算法求解优化问题。

Result: 在基准数据集上优于现有聚类方法，验证了算法的收敛性。

Conclusion: CRG_IMSC有效解决了不完备多视图聚类问题，直接获得聚类结果并充分利用样本连通性。

Abstract: Incomplete multi-view spectral clustering generalizes spectral clustering to
multi-view data and simultaneously realizes the partition of multi-view data
with missing views. For this category of method, K-means algorithm needs to be
performed to generate the clustering result after the procedure of feature
extraction. More importantly, the connectivity of samples reflected by the
clustering result is not utilized effectively. To overcome these defects, we
propose Clustering Result re-Guided Incomplete Multi-view Spectral Clustering
(CRG_IMSC). CRG_IMSC obtains the clustering result directly by imposing
nonnegative constraint to the extracted feature. Furthermore, it constructs the
connectivity matrix according to the result of spectral clustering, and
minimizes the residual of self-representation based on the connectivity matrix.
A novel iterative algorithm using multiplicative update is developed to solve
the optimization problem of CRG_IMSC, and its convergence is proved rigorously.
On benchmark datasets, for multi-view data, CRG_IMSC performs better than
state-of-the-art clustering methods, and the experimental results also
demonstrate the convergence of CRG_IMSC algorithm.

Conclusion: 提出的同态抽象框架和算法能够在保证最优策略等价性的前提下有效降低计算复杂度，EBHPG在计算效率和性能损失之间取得了良好平衡

Abstract: State aggregation aims to reduce the computational complexity of solving
Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) while preserving the performance of the
original system. A fundamental challenge lies in optimizing policies within the
aggregated, or abstract, space such that the performance remains optimal in the
ground MDP-a property referred to as {"}optimal policy equivalence {"}.
  This paper presents an abstraction framework based on the notion of
homomorphism, in which two Markov chains are deemed homomorphic if their value
functions exhibit a linear relationship. Within this theoretical framework, we
establish a sufficient condition for the equivalence of optimal policy.
  We further examine scenarios where the sufficient condition is not met and
derive an upper bound on the approximation error and a performance lower bound
for the objective function under the ground MDP. We propose Homomorphic Policy
Gradient (HPG), which guarantees optimal policy equivalence under sufficient
conditions, and its extension, Error-Bounded HPG (EBHPG), which balances
computational efficiency and the performance loss induced by aggregation. In
the experiments, we validated the theoretical results and conducted comparative
evaluations against seven algorithms.

Motivation: 现有的视觉-语言-动作模型性能受限于监督数据的质量和覆盖范围，而传统强化学习方法在流匹配模型中由于重要性采样过程难以计算而不可行。

Method: FPO算法通过重新定义重要性采样，利用条件流匹配目标的逐样本变化，并结合结构感知信用分配、裁剪代理目标、多步潜在探索和Q集成机制来实现稳定和可扩展的在线强化微调。

Result: 在LIBERO基准和ALOHA模拟任务上的评估显示，FPO相比监督学习、偏好对齐、扩散基线和自回归在线RL等方法有持续改进，在稀疏奖励下实现稳定学习。

Conclusion: FPO算法有效解决了流匹配模型在线强化学习的计算挑战，通过提出的计算模块实现了稳定的条件流匹配目标收敛，提升了视觉-语言-动作模型的性能。

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models such as OpenVLA, Octo, and $\pi_0$ have
shown strong generalization by leveraging large-scale demonstrations, yet their
performance is still fundamentally constrained by the quality and coverage of
supervised data. Reinforcement learning (RL) provides a promising path for
improving and fine-tuning VLAs through online interaction. However,
conventional policy gradient methods are computationally infeasible in the
context of flow-matching based models due to the intractability of the
importance sampling process, which requires explicit computation of policy
ratios. To overcome this limitation, we propose Flow Policy Optimization (FPO)
algorithm, which reformulates importance sampling by leveraging per-sample
changes in the conditional flow-matching objective. Furthermore, FPO achieves
stable and scalable online reinforcement fine-tuning of the $\pi_0$ model by
integrating structure-aware credit assignment to enhance gradient efficiency,
clipped surrogate objectives to stabilize optimization, multi-step latent
exploration to encourage diverse policy updates, and a Q-ensemble mechanism to
provide robust value estimation. We evaluate FPO on the LIBERO benchmark and
the ALOHA simulation task against supervised, preference-aligned,
diffusion-based, autoregressive online RL, and $\pi_0$-FAST baselines,
observing consistent improvements over the imitation prior and strong
alternatives with stable learning under sparse rewards. In addition, ablation
studies and analyses of the latent space dynamics further highlight the
contributions of individual components within FPO, validating the effectiveness
of the proposed computational modules and the stable convergence of the
conditional flow-matching objective during online RL.

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效识别制造过程中的语义异常，特别是在增材制造中精确检测缺陷异常的起始位置。

Abstract: Online sensing plays an important role in advancing modern manufacturing. The
real-time sensor signals, which can be stored as high-resolution time series
data, contain rich information about the operation status. One of its popular
usages is online process monitoring, which can be achieved by effective anomaly
detection from the sensor signals. However, most existing approaches either
heavily rely on labeled data for training supervised models, or are designed to
detect only extreme outliers, thus are ineffective at identifying subtle
semantic off-track anomalies to capture where new regimes or unexpected
routines start. To address this challenge, we propose an matrix profile-based
unsupervised anomaly detection algorithm that captures fabrication cycle
similarity and performs semantic segmentation to precisely identify the onset
of defect anomalies in additive manufacturing. The effectiveness of the
proposed method is demonstrated by the experiments on real-world sensor data.

Motivation: 现有研究主要关注单一类型的图表示，而函数调用图和进程交互图的联合建模尚未充分探索，这为软件系统的多视角分析提供了机会。

Method: 构建了635个Windows可执行文件的数据集，使用Ghidra提取FCGs，Any.Run沙箱提取PCGs。GeminiNet采用双图卷积分支和自适应门控机制来学习联合嵌入。

Result: 实验证明联合嵌入模型优于单图模型。

Conclusion: 通过联合建模FCGs和PCGs，GeminiNet能够提供更深入的软件系统多视角分析，验证了多图表示在软件行为分析中的优势。

Abstract: Software systems can be represented as graphs, capturing dependencies among
functions and processes. An interesting aspect of software systems is that they
can be represented as different types of graphs, depending on the extraction
goals and priorities. For example, function calls within the software can be
captured to create function call graphs, which highlight the relationships
between functions and their dependencies. Alternatively, the processes spawned
by the software can be modeled to generate process interaction graphs, which
focus on runtime behavior and inter-process communication. While these graph
representations are related, each captures a distinct perspective of the
system, providing complementary insights into its structure and operation.
While previous studies have leveraged graph neural networks (GNNs) to analyze
software behaviors, most of this work has focused on a single type of graph
representation. The joint modeling of both function call graphs and process
interaction graphs remains largely underexplored, leaving opportunities for
deeper, multi-perspective analysis of software systems. This paper presents a
pipeline for constructing and training Function Call Graphs (FCGs) and Process
Call Graphs (PCGs) and learning joint embeddings. We demonstrate that joint
embeddings outperform a single-graph model. In this paper, we propose
GeminiNet, a unified neural network approach that learns joint embeddings from
both FCGs and PCGs. We construct a new dataset of 635 Windows executables (318
malicious and 317 benign), extracting FCGs via Ghidra and PCGs via Any.Run
sandbox. GeminiNet employs dual graph convolutional branches with an adaptive
gating mechanism that balances contributions from static and dynamic views.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于全局Lipschitz连续性或强对偶性的WDRO方法存在上界松弛或计算复杂度过高的问题，需要更紧的上界和更高效的计算方法。

Method: 采用原始方法，引入精确Lipschitz证书来收紧WDRO上界，并提出Wasserstein分布攻击直接构造最坏情况分布，利用ReLU网络的激活单元分段仿射结构实现精确可处理的WDRO问题表征。

Result: 实验表明该方法在保持与最先进基线相当的鲁棒准确率的同时，提供了比现有方法更紧的证书。

Conclusion: 提出的方法成功解决了WDRO中上界松弛和计算复杂度过高的问题，为对抗鲁棒性提供了更有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Wasserstein distributionally robust optimization (WDRO) provides a framework
for adversarial robustness, yet existing methods based on global Lipschitz
continuity or strong duality often yield loose upper bounds or require
prohibitive computation. In this work, we address these limitations by
introducing a primal approach and adopting a notion of exact Lipschitz
certificate to tighten this upper bound of WDRO. In addition, we propose a
novel Wasserstein distributional attack (WDA) that directly constructs a
candidate for the worst-case distribution. Compared to existing point-wise
attack and its variants, our WDA offers greater flexibility in the number and
location of attack points. In particular, by leveraging the piecewise-affine
structure of ReLU networks on their activation cells, our approach results in
an exact tractable characterization of the corresponding WDRO problem.
Extensive evaluations demonstrate that our method achieves competitive robust
accuracy against state-of-the-art baselines while offering tighter certificates
than existing methods. Our code is available at

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有EEG识别模型由于数据集特定约束和个体变异性，存在跨范式泛化能力差的问题，需要开发统一架构来克服这些限制。

Method: 采用端到端统一架构，包含：1）对齐的时频流保持时间同步；2）金字塔时频注意力增强关键神经模式；3）双向自适应卷积捕获前向/后向神经动态。

Result: 在四个不同范式（BCICIV-2A/2B、HGD、SD-SSVEP）上实现最先进性能，在个体内准确率和跨个体泛化方面表现优异。

Conclusion: 验证了范式对齐的频谱-时间处理对于可靠脑机接口系统至关重要，BITE作为统一架构在运动想象和SSVEP任务中均表现出色且计算高效。

Abstract: Existing EEG recognition models suffer from poor cross-paradigm
generalization due to dataset-specific constraints and individual variability.
To overcome these limitations, we propose BITE (Bidirectional Time-Freq Pyramid
Network), an end-to-end unified architecture featuring robust multistream
synergy, pyramid time-frequency attention (PTFA), and bidirectional adaptive
convolutions. The framework uniquely integrates: 1) Aligned time-frequency
streams maintaining temporal synchronization with STFT for bidirectional
modeling, 2) PTFA-based multi-scale feature enhancement amplifying critical
neural patterns, 3) BiTCN with learnable fusion capturing forward/backward
neural dynamics. Demonstrating enhanced robustness, BITE achieves
state-of-the-art performance across four divergent paradigms (BCICIV-2A/2B,
HGD, SD-SSVEP), excelling in both within-subject accuracy and cross-subject
generalization. As a unified architecture, it combines robust performance
across both MI and SSVEP tasks with exceptional computational efficiency. Our
work validates that paradigm-aligned spectral-temporal processing is essential
for reliable BCI systems. Just as its name suggests, BITE "takes a bite out of
EEG." The source code is available at https://github.com/cindy-hong/BiteEEG.

Motivation: 传统监督微调在类似训练数据上往往效果饱和，需要新的训练策略来突破性能瓶颈。

Method: STAT方法：教师模型分析任务所需技能并标记数据点，通过监控学生回答创建缺失技能档案，然后采用STAT-Sel（重加权现有样本）或STAT-Syn（合成新样本）构建训练集。

Result: 在Llama和Qwen模型上，STAT在MATH数据集上提升达7.5%，在分布外基准上平均提升4.6%，且与GRPO强化学习互补。

Conclusion: 技能导向的自适应训练应广泛改进当前训练流程，有效解决模型技能缺失问题。

Abstract: Language models often show little to no improvement (i.e., "saturation") when
trained via vanilla supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on data similar to what they
saw in their training set (e.g., MATH). We introduce a new fine-tuning
strategy, STAT, to train such a student model by using the metacognition
ability of a stronger large language model (LLM) as the teacher. The teacher
uses the task dataset to create a list of skills needed for the task, and then
labels each data point with its required skills (Didolkar et al., 2024). By
monitoring the student's answers, the teacher creates a Missing-Skill-Profile
for the student, tracking how often they failed to apply each skill in their
responses. We use this idea to build a modified training set in one of two
ways. In STAT-Sel, the teacher uses an existing set of training examples but
adaptively reweights them according to the Missing-Skill-Profile. In STAT-Syn,
the teacher synthesizes additional examples involving missing skills. Across
extensive experiments on Llama and Qwen models, our methods yield improvements
of up to 7.5% on MATH, whereas SFT provides only limited gains. Furthermore,
STAT enhances performance on out-of-distribution benchmarks (e.g., AIME24/25,
AMC23, etc.) by an average of 4.6%. Crucially, we find that STAT is
complementary to RL via GRPO (Shao et al., 2024): after the model is improved
using STAT to address skill gaps, GRPO continues to add further gains. We
conclude that skill-targeted adaptive training should broadly improve current
training pipelines. Our code is available at:

Conclusion: PPOPT提供了一种高效的无模型强化学习方法，特别适合计算资源有限的小样本场景，已开源实现。

Abstract: We introduce PPOPT - Proximal Policy Optimization using Pretraining, a novel,
model-free deep-reinforcement-learning algorithm that leverages pretraining to
achieve high training efficiency and stability on very small training samples
in physics-based environments. Reinforcement learning agents typically rely on
large samples of environment interactions to learn a policy. However, frequent
interactions with a (computer-simulated) environment may incur high
computational costs, especially when the environment is complex. Our main
innovation is a new policy neural network architecture that consists of a
pretrained neural network middle section sandwiched between two fully-connected
networks. Pretraining part of the network on a different environment with
similar physics will help the agent learn the target environment with high
efficiency because it will leverage a general understanding of the
transferrable physics characteristics from the pretraining environment. We
demonstrate that PPOPT outperforms baseline classic PPO on small training
samples both in terms of rewards gained and general training stability. While
PPOPT underperforms against classic model-based methods such as DYNA DDPG, the
model-free nature of PPOPT allows it to train in significantly less time than
its model-based counterparts. Finally, we present our implementation of PPOPT
as open-source software, available at github.com/Davidrxyang/PPOPT.

Abstract: Deep learning in small and imbalanced biomedical datasets remains
fundamentally constrained by unstable optimization and poor generalization. We
present the first biomedical implementation of FOSSIL (Flexible Optimization

framework that adaptively balances training emphasis according to sample
difficulty. Using softmax-based uncertainty as a continuous measure of
difficulty, we construct a four-stage curriculum (Easy-Very Hard) and integrate
FOSSIL into both convolutional and transformer-based architectures for Mpox
skin lesion diagnosis. Across all settings, FOSSIL substantially improves
discrimination (AUC = 0.9573), calibration (ECE = 0.053), and robustness under
real-world perturbations, outperforming conventional baselines without
metadata, manual curation, or synthetic augmentation. The results position
FOSSIL as a generalizable, data-efficient, and interpretable framework for

Conclusion: O4M-SP框架在3D-BPP中展现出强大的泛化能力和实际适用性，为物流仓储中的复杂装箱问题提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: The three-dimensional bin packing problem (3D-BPP) is widely applied in
logistics and warehousing. Existing learning-based approaches often neglect
practical stability-related constraints and exhibit limitations in generalizing
across diverse bin dimensions. To address these limitations, we propose a novel
deep reinforcement learning framework, One4Many-StablePacker (O4M-SP). The
primary advantage of O4M-SP is its ability to handle various bin dimensions in
a single training process while incorporating support and weight constraints
common in practice. Our training method introduces two innovative mechanisms.
First, it employs a weighted reward function that integrates loading rate and a
new height difference metric for packing layouts, promoting improved bin
utilization through flatter packing configurations. Second, it combines clipped
policy gradient optimization with a tailored policy drifting method to mitigate
policy entropy collapse, encouraging exploration at critical decision nodes
during packing to avoid suboptimal solutions. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that O4M-SP generalizes successfully across diverse bin dimensions and
significantly outperforms baseline methods. Furthermore, O4M-SP exhibits strong
practical applicability by effectively addressing packing scenarios with
stability constraints.

Conclusion: Translution成功结合了自注意力和卷积的优势，在保持高性能的同时通过轻量级变体解决了参数过多的问题。

Abstract: When modeling a given type of data, we consider it to involve two key
aspects: 1) identifying relevant elements (e.g., image pixels or textual words)
to a central element, as in a convolutional receptive field, or to a query
element, as in self-attention, and 2) encoding these tokens effectively.
Self-attention can adaptively identify these elements but relies on absolute
positional embedding for structural representation learning. In contrast,
convolution encodes elements in a relative manner, yet their fixed kernel size
limits their ability to adaptively select the relevant elements. In this paper,
we introduce Translution, an operation that unifies the adaptive identification
capability of self-attention and the relative encoding advantage of
convolution. However, this integration leads to a substantial increase in the
number of parameters, exceeding most currently available computational
resources. Therefore, we propose a lightweight variant of Translution, named
{\alpha}-Translution. Experiments on computer vision and natural language
processing tasks show that Translution (including {\alpha}-Translution)
achieves superior accuracy compared to self-attention. The code is available at

expansion and updates still entangle general and domain learning, undermining
its effectiveness. Our pilot studies reveal that LLMs exhibit functional
specialization, where layers and units differentially encode general-critical
capabilities, suggesting that parameter expansion and optimization should be
function-aware. We then propose ADEPT, Adaptive Expansion and Dynamic Decoupled
Tuning for continual pretraining, a two-stage framework for domain-adaptive
CPT. ADEPT first performs General-Competence Guided Selective Layer Expansion,
duplicating layers least critical for the general domain to increase
representational capacity while minimizing interference with general knowledge.
It then applies Adaptive Unit-Wise Decoupled Tuning, disentangling parameter
units within expanded layers according to their general-domain importance and
assigning asymmetric learning rates to balance knowledge injection and
retention. Experiments on mathematical and medical benchmarks show that ADEPT
outperforms full-parameter CPT by up to 5.76% on the general domain and 5.58%
on the target domain with only 15% of parameters tuned and less than 50%
training time. Ablation studies, theoretical analysis, and extended
investigations further demonstrate the necessity of targeted expansion and
decoupled optimization, providing new principles for efficient and robust
domain-adaptive CPT. Our code is open-sourced at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度神经网络在时间序列分类中表现出色，但可能依赖训练数据中的虚假相关性，这种捷径行为在时间序列领域尚未充分探索。现有研究多关注外部属性而非时间序列模型的内部偏差行为。

Method: 提出了一种基于其他类别的简单检测方法，用于检测捷径行为，该方法不需要测试数据或干净训练类别。

Conclusion: 该研究首次建立了深度学习时间序列分类中的基于点捷径学习行为，并提供了有效的检测方案。

Abstract: Deep learning models have attracted lots of research attention in time series
classification (TSC) task in the past two decades. Recently, deep neural
networks (DNN) have surpassed classical distance-based methods and achieved
state-of-the-art performance. Despite their promising performance, deep neural
networks (DNNs) have been shown to rely on spurious correlations present in the
training data, which can hinder generalization. For instance, a model might
incorrectly associate the presence of grass with the label ``cat" if the
training set have majority of cats lying in grassy backgrounds. However, the
shortcut behavior of DNNs in time series remain under-explored. Most existing
shortcut work are relying on external attributes such as gender, patients
group, instead of focus on the internal bias behavior in time series models.
  In this paper, we take the first step to investigate and establish
point-based shortcut learning behavior in deep learning time series
classification. We further propose a simple detection method based on other
class to detect shortcut occurs without relying on test data or clean training
classes. We test our proposed method in UCR time series datasets.

*Zixuan Gong,Jiaye Teng,Yong Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文通过损失景观几何视角解释了循环transformer在复杂推理任务中优于标准transformer的原因，提出了River-Valley景观模型，并基于此开发了SHIFT分阶段训练框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 循环transformer在复杂推理任务中表现优于标准transformer，但其理论优势尚未得到充分探索，需要从损失景观几何角度解释这一现象。

Method: 扩展River-Valley景观模型，区分U形山谷（平坦）和V形山谷（陡峭），基于经验观察提出循环架构诱导River-V-Valley景观偏置的理论，并开发SHIFT分阶段训练框架。

Result: 理论推导表明循环transformer的景观偏置能保证更好的损失收敛，并促进复杂模式的学习，SHIFT框架能加速训练过程并达到可比性能。

Conclusion: 循环transformer的递归架构通过诱导V形山谷景观偏置获得理论优势，SHIFT框架验证了这一洞察的实际应用价值。

Abstract: While looped transformers (termed as Looped-Attn) often outperform standard
transformers (termed as Single-Attn) on complex reasoning tasks, the
theoretical basis for this advantage remains underexplored. In this paper, we
explain this phenomenon through the lens of loss landscape geometry, inspired
by empirical observations of their distinct dynamics at both sample and Hessian
levels. To formalize this, we extend the River-Valley landscape model by
distinguishing between U-shaped valleys (flat) and V-shaped valleys (steep).
Based on empirical observations, we conjecture that the recursive architecture
of Looped-Attn induces a landscape-level inductive bias towards River-V-Valley.
Theoretical derivations based on this inductive bias guarantee a better loss
convergence along the river due to valley hopping, and further encourage
learning about complex patterns compared to the River-U-Valley induced by
Single-Attn. Building on this insight, we propose SHIFT (Staged HIerarchical
Framework for Progressive Training), a staged training framework that
accelerates the training process of Looped-Attn while achieving comparable
performances.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文通过染色算法将图神经网络(GNN)的表达能力与泛化能力联系起来，证明了WL染色诱导的等价类数量直接限制了GNN的Rademacher复杂度，从而解释了表达能力越强、泛化能力越弱的权衡现象。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然表达能力更强的GNN能够区分更多类型的图，但实践中观察到它们往往具有更高的泛化误差。本文旨在从理论上解释这种表达能力与泛化能力之间的权衡关系。

Method: 通过染色算法的视角，将WL染色诱导的等价类数量与GNN的Rademacher复杂度联系起来，分析表达能力对泛化能力的影响，并证明Rademacher复杂度在颜色计数扰动下的稳定性。

Result: 证明了表达能力更强的GNN具有更高的Rademacher复杂度，从而导致更弱的泛化保证。同时证明了Rademacher复杂度在不同样本颜色计数扰动下是稳定的。

Conclusion: 该框架统一了GNN表达能力和泛化能力的研究，为理解增加表达能力往往以牺牲泛化为代价提供了理论依据，且该框架不仅限于消息传递GNN或1-WL，可扩展到任意GNN架构和表达能力度量。

Abstract: The expressive power of graph neural networks (GNNs) is typically understood
through their correspondence with graph isomorphism tests such as the
Weisfeiler-Leman (WL) hierarchy. While more expressive GNNs can distinguish a
richer set of graphs, they are also observed to suffer from higher
generalization error. This work provides a theoretical explanation for this
trade-off by linking expressivity and generalization through the lens of
coloring algorithms. Specifically, we show that the number of equivalence
classes induced by WL colorings directly bounds the GNNs Rademacher complexity
-- a key data-dependent measure of generalization. Our analysis reveals that
greater expressivity leads to higher complexity and thus weaker generalization
guarantees. Furthermore, we prove that the Rademacher complexity is stable
under perturbations in the color counts across different samples, ensuring
robustness to sampling variability across datasets. Importantly, our framework
is not restricted to message-passing GNNs or 1-WL, but extends to arbitrary GNN
architectures and expressivity measures that partition graphs into equivalence
classes. These results unify the study of expressivity and generalization in
GNNs, providing a principled understanding of why increasing expressive power
often comes at the cost of generalization.

*Guilin Li,Yun Zhang,Xiuyuan Chen,Chengqi Li,Bo Wang,Linghe Kong,Wenjia Wang,Weiran Huang,Matthias Hwai Yong Tan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PANTHER是一个混合生成-判别框架，将生成式预训练扩展到用户行为建模，通过结构化标记化、序列模式识别和统一用户画像嵌入，在微信支付中实现了交易预测和欺诈检测的显著提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型虽然能封装广泛的世界知识，但在建模用户交互历史中的行为知识方面存在局限。用户行为构成独特模态，需要处理高基数序列，而判别模型在有限监督下往往表现不佳。

Method: 提出PANTHER框架：1) 结构化标记化将多维交易属性压缩为可解释词汇；2) 序列模式识别模块建模周期性交易模式；3) 统一用户画像嵌入融合静态人口统计和动态交易历史；4) 通过离线缓存预训练嵌入实现实时可扩展性。

Result: 在微信支付中完全部署运行，相比基线方法：下一交易预测HitRate@1提升25.6%，欺诈检测召回率相对提升38.6%。在公共基准测试中，跨领域评估显示强泛化能力，比transformer基线最高提升21% HitRate@1。

Conclusion: PANTHER被确立为一个可扩展、高性能的工业级序列用户行为建模框架，成功将生成式预训练应用于用户行为建模。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown that generative pretraining can
distill vast world knowledge into compact token representations. While LLMs
encapsulate extensive world knowledge, they remain limited in modeling the
behavioral knowledge contained within user interaction histories. User behavior
forms a distinct modality, where each action, defined by multi-dimensional
attributes such as time, context, and transaction type, constitutes a
behavioral token. Modeling these high-cardinality sequences is challenging, and
discriminative models often falter under limited supervision. To bridge this
gap, we extend generative pretraining to user behavior, learning transferable
representations from unlabeled behavioral data analogous to how LLMs learn from
text. We present PANTHER, a hybrid generative-discriminative framework that
unifies user behavior pretraining and downstream adaptation, enabling
large-scale sequential user representation learning and real-time inference.
PANTHER introduces: (1) Structured Tokenization to compress multi-dimensional
transaction attributes into an interpretable vocabulary; (2) Sequence Pattern
Recognition Module (SPRM) for modeling periodic transaction motifs; (3) a
Unified User-Profile Embedding that fuses static demographics with dynamic
transaction histories; and (4) Real-time scalability enabled by offline caching
of pretrained embeddings for millisecond-level inference. Fully deployed and
operational online at WeChat Pay, PANTHER delivers a 25.6 percent boost in
next-transaction prediction HitRate@1 and a 38.6 percent relative improvement
in fraud detection recall over baselines. Cross-domain evaluations on public
benchmarks show strong generalization, achieving up to 21 percent HitRate@1
gains over transformer baselines, establishing PANTHER as a scalable,
high-performance framework for industrial sequential user behavior modeling.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Lighter-X是一个高效的图神经网络推荐框架，通过压缩稀疏邻接结构和高维嵌入矩阵，将参数复杂度从O(n×d)降低到O(h×d)，同时保持模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于图的推荐系统（如LightGCN）需要为每个节点维护大小为d的嵌入，导致参数复杂度为O(n×d)，这在处理大规模图时面临严重的可扩展性挑战。

Method: 分析原始结构和参数冗余，提出高效的压缩方案，包括稀疏邻接结构和高维嵌入矩阵的压缩，并采用解耦框架优化训练过程。

Result: 在大规模交互图上，Lighter-X仅使用LightGCN 1%的参数就能达到相当甚至更好的性能。

Conclusion: Lighter-X显著减少了参数规模和计算复杂度，同时保持了基础模型的理论保证和实证性能，实现了大规模实际部署。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated remarkable effectiveness in
recommendation systems. However, conventional graph-based recommenders, such as
LightGCN, require maintaining embeddings of size $d$ for each node, resulting
in a parameter complexity of $\mathcal{O}(n \times d)$, where $n$ represents
the total number of users and items. This scaling pattern poses significant
challenges for deployment on large-scale graphs encountered in real-world
applications. To address this scalability limitation, we propose
\textbf{Lighter-X}, an efficient and modular framework that can be seamlessly
integrated with existing GNN-based recommender architectures. Our approach
substantially reduces both parameter size and computational complexity while
preserving the theoretical guarantees and empirical performance of the base
models, thereby enabling practical deployment at scale. Specifically, we
analyze the original structure and inherent redundancy in their parameters,
identifying opportunities for optimization. Based on this insight, we propose
an efficient compression scheme for the sparse adjacency structure and
high-dimensional embedding matrices, achieving a parameter complexity of
$\mathcal{O}(h \times d)$, where $h \ll n$. Furthermore, the model is optimized
through a decoupled framework, reducing computational complexity during the
training process and enhancing scalability. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that Lighter-X achieves comparable performance to baseline models with
significantly fewer parameters. In particular, on large-scale interaction
graphs with millions of edges, we are able to attain even better results with
only 1\% of the parameter over LightGCN.

TL;DR: 提出了一种偏好驱动的知识蒸馏框架，结合LLMs和GNNs的优势进行少样本节点分类，通过GNN偏好驱动的节点选择器和节点偏好驱动的GNN选择器实现高效知识传递。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GNNs依赖人工标注标签且难以处理复杂多样的局部拓扑结构，LLMs在少样本学习上表现良好但存在可扩展性问题，需要结合两者的互补优势。

Method: 开发了GNN偏好驱动的节点选择器促进从LLMs到教师GNNs的预测蒸馏，以及节点偏好驱动的GNN选择器为每个节点选择最合适的教师GNN进行定制化知识蒸馏。

Result: 在真实世界文本属性图上的大量实验验证了该框架在少样本节点分类中的有效性。

Conclusion: 该偏好驱动知识蒸馏框架成功结合了LLMs和GNNs的互补优势，有效解决了少样本节点分类问题。

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) can efficiently process text-attributed graphs
(TAGs) due to their message-passing mechanisms, but their training heavily
relies on the human-annotated labels. Moreover, the complex and diverse local
topologies of nodes of real-world TAGs make it challenging for a single
mechanism to handle. Large language models (LLMs) perform well in
zero-/few-shot learning on TAGs but suffer from a scalability challenge.
Therefore, we propose a preference-driven knowledge distillation (PKD)
framework to synergize the complementary strengths of LLMs and various GNNs for
few-shot node classification. Specifically, we develop a GNN-preference-driven
node selector that effectively promotes prediction distillation from LLMs to
teacher GNNs. To further tackle nodes' intricate local topologies, we develop a
node-preference-driven GNN selector that identifies the most suitable teacher
GNN for each node, thereby facilitating tailored knowledge distillation from
teacher GNNs to the student GNN. Extensive experiments validate the efficacy of
our proposed framework in few-shot node classification on real-world TAGs.

*Bin Yang,Qiuyu Leng,Jun Zeng,Zhenhua Wu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CacheClip是一个解决RAG系统TTFT瓶颈的新框架，通过辅助LLM指导的KV缓存选择性重计算、共享前缀和分组策略，在保持高质量的同时显著加速推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有KV缓存复用方法在RAG场景中存在根本性权衡：前缀缓存需要完全相同的前缀（在RAG中很少出现），而直接预计算由于缺少跨块注意力和重复注意力汇聚而牺牲质量。

Method: CacheClip集成三种技术：(1)辅助模型指导的令牌选择进行选择性KV缓存重计算，(2)共享前缀消除冗余注意力汇聚，(3)分组策略在部分KV缓存更新期间保持局部连贯性。

Result: 实验显示CacheClip在NIAH和LongBench上分别保持94.8%和85.0%的全注意力性能，比APE和CacheBlend在NIAH上分别提升25.2%和35.1%，同时将LLM推理预填充时间加速达1.92倍。

Conclusion: CacheClip为RAG系统中的效率-质量权衡提供了实用解决方案，实现了快速TTFT和高质量生成的平衡。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems suffer from severe
time-to-first-token (TTFT) bottlenecks due to long input sequences. Existing KV
cache reuse methods face a fundamental trade-off: prefix caching requires
identical prefixes that rarely occur in RAG scenarios, while direct
precomputation sacrifices quality due to missing inter-chunk attention and
repeated attention sinks. Recent methods like APE and CacheBlend partially
address these issues but remain inadequate for robust RAG applications. This
paper presents CacheClip, a novel framework that achieves both fast TTFT and
high generation quality. Our key insight is that small auxiliary LLMs exhibit
similar last-layer attention distributions to primary LLMs (the target model
for generation), enabling efficient identification of tokens critical for
restoring inter-chunk attention, thereby significantly improving response
quality on cross-chunk reasoning tasks. CacheClip integrates three techniques:
(1) auxiliary-model-guided token selection for selective KV cache
recomputation, where the auxiliary model is finetuned to improve selection
accuracy, (2) shared prefixes to eliminate redundant attention sinks, and (3)
grouping strategy to maintain local coherence during partial KV cache updates.
Experiments show CacheClip retains up to 94.8% and 85.0% of full-attention
performance on NIAH and LongBench, outperforming APE and CacheBlend by 25.2%
and 35.1% on NIAH (with reomp% = 20%). Meanwhile, CacheClip accelerates LLM
inference by up to 1.92x in prefill time, providing a practical solution to the
efficiency-quality trade-off in RAG systems.

TL;DR: PermLLM是一个新颖的后训练剪枝框架，通过可学习的通道置换(LCP)来优化N:M稀疏模型，使用Sinkhorn归一化实现端到端优化，显著提升模型精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统通道置换方法依赖手工设计的质量指标，往往无法准确捕捉剪枝对模型性能的真实影响，因此需要更智能的优化方法。

Method: 提出可学习的通道置换(LCP)，利用Sinkhorn归一化将离散置换矩阵转换为可微分的软置换矩阵；采用高效的块级通道置换策略减少可学习参数和计算复杂度；与现有一次性剪枝方法无缝集成。

Result: 在LLaMA系列、Qwen和OPT模型上的大量实验表明，PermLLM在优化N:M稀疏模型方面实现了卓越性能。

Conclusion: PermLLM通过可学习的通道置换有效缓解剪枝引起的误差，为N:M稀疏模型提供了高效的优化解决方案。

Abstract: Channel permutation is a powerful technique for enhancing the accuracy of N:M
sparse models by reordering the channels of weight matrices to prioritize the
retention of important weights. However, traditional channel permutation
methods rely on handcrafted quality metrics, which often fail to accurately
capture the true impact of pruning on model performance. To address this
limitation, we propose PermLLM, a novel post-training pruning framework that
introduces learnable channel permutation (LCP) for N:M sparsity. LCP leverages
Sinkhorn normalization to transform discrete permutation matrices into
differentiable soft permutation matrices, enabling end-to-end optimization.
Additionally, PermLLM incorporates an efficient block-wise channel permutation
strategy, which significantly reduces the number of learnable parameters and
computational complexity. PermLLM seamlessly integrates with existing one-shot
pruning methods to adaptively optimize channel permutations, effectively
mitigating pruning-induced errors. Extensive experiments on the LLaMA series,
Qwen, and OPT models demonstrate that PermLLM achieves superior performance in
optimizing N:M sparse models. The code is available at

Conclusion: Cyc-Attack证明了深度学习天气预报模型在面对精心设计的对抗攻击时的脆弱性，为提升模型鲁棒性提供了重要启示。

Abstract: Deep learning based weather forecasting (DLWF) models leverage past weather
observations to generate future forecasts, supporting a wide range of
downstream tasks, including tropical cyclone (TC) trajectory prediction. In
this paper, we investigate their vulnerability to adversarial attacks, where
subtle perturbations to the upstream weather forecasts can alter the downstream
TC trajectory predictions. Although research on adversarial attacks in DLWF
models has grown recently, generating perturbed upstream forecasts that
reliably steer downstream output toward attacker-specified trajectories remains
a challenge. First, conventional TC detection systems are opaque,
non-differentiable black boxes, making standard gradient-based attacks
infeasible. Second, the extreme rarity of TC events leads to severe class
imbalance problem, making it difficult to develop efficient attack methods that
will produce the attacker's target trajectories. Furthermore, maintaining
physical consistency in adversarially generated forecasts presents another
significant challenge. To overcome these limitations, we propose Cyc-Attack, a
novel method that perturbs the upstream forecasts of DLWF models to generate
adversarial trajectories. First, we pre-train a differentiable surrogate model
to approximate the TC detector's output, enabling the construction of
gradient-based attacks. Cyc-Attack also employs skewness-aware loss function
with kernel dilation strategy to address the imbalance problem. Finally, a
distance-based gradient weighting scheme and regularization are used to
constrain the perturbations and eliminate spurious trajectories to ensure the
adversarial forecasts are realistic and not easily detectable.

Conclusion: FIRE框架通过频域分解方法为时间序列预测提供了数学抽象，在保持高性能的同时显著提升了模型的可解释性。

Abstract: Current approaches for time series forecasting, whether in the time or
frequency domain, predominantly use deep learning models based on linear layers
or transformers. They often encode time series data in a black-box manner and
rely on trial-and-error optimization solely based on forecasting performance,
leading to limited interpretability and theoretical understanding. Furthermore,
the dynamics in data distribution over time and frequency domains pose a
critical challenge to accurate forecasting. We propose FIRE, a unified
frequency domain decomposition framework that provides a mathematical
abstraction for diverse types of time series, so as to achieve interpretable
and robust time series forecasting. FIRE introduces several key innovations:
(i) independent modeling of amplitude and phase components, (ii) adaptive
learning of weights of frequency basis components, (iii) a targeted loss
function, and (iv) a novel training paradigm for sparse data. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that FIRE consistently outperforms state-of-the-art
models on long-term forecasting benchmarks, achieving superior predictive
performance and significantly enhancing interpretability of time series

Abstract: Conditional diffusion models have the generative controllability by
incorporating external conditions. However, their performance significantly
degrades with noisy conditions, such as corrupted labels in the image
generation or unreliable observations or states in the control policy
generation. This paper introduces a robust learning framework to address
extremely noisy conditions in conditional diffusion models. We empirically
demonstrate that existing noise-robust methods fail when the noise level is
high. To overcome this, we propose learning pseudo conditions as surrogates for
clean conditions and refining pseudo ones progressively via the technique of
temporal ensembling. Additionally, we develop a Reverse-time Diffusion
Condition (RDC) technique, which diffuses pseudo conditions to reinforce the
memorization effect and further facilitate the refinement of the pseudo
conditions. Experimentally, our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance
across a range of noise levels on both class-conditional image generation and
visuomotor policy generation tasks.The code can be accessible via the project

Motivation: RLVR训练存在熵崩溃风险，即策略多样性快速丧失，导致泛化能力不足。现有熵干预方法机制不明确且效果有限，需要更直接的熵动态控制方法。

Abstract: While Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) can enhance LLM
reasoning, its training process poses a critical risk: entropy collapse. This
phenomenon is a rapid loss of policy diversity, stemming from the
exploration-exploitation imbalance and leading to a lack of generalization.
Recent entropy-intervention methods aim to prevent \coloredtext{entropy
collapse}, yet their underlying mechanisms remain unclear. In this paper, we
conduct a quantitative analysis to reveal token-level entropy changes and how
existing entropy intervention methods help avoid entropy collapse. Our findings
point out a fundamental limitation of existing methods: they attempt to control
entropy dynamics indirectly. By only affecting related factors, such as the
advantage signal and generation probability, their effectiveness is inherently
limited and could potentially fail. To address this limitation, we introduce an
entropy-change-aware reweighting scheme, namely Stabilizing Token-level
Entropy-changE via Reweighting (STEER), that adaptively stabilizes entropy
dynamics through fine-grained token-level adjustments. Our approach mitigates
over-exploitation while fostering robust exploration. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that STEER significantly mitigates entropy collapse, stabilizes
entropy dynamics, and achieves stronger downstream performance across various
mathematical reasoning benchmarks \footnote{Our code is available at

Abstract: Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) have gained success in various signal
processing tasks due to their advantages of continuity and infinite resolution.
However, the factors influencing their effectiveness and limitations remain
underexplored. To better understand these factors, we leverage insights from
Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) theory to analyze how model architectures (classic

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于柯西积分公式的新型神经网络CauchyNet，用于函数逼近任务，在时间序列预测和缺失数据填补等应用中表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统实值模型在处理复杂时间依赖关系时存在局限性，需要开发更高效的函数逼近方法。

Method: 将实值数据嵌入复平面，利用柯西积分公式和复值激活函数构建神经网络架构，实现紧凑参数和低计算开销。

Result: 在交通、能源消耗和流行病学数据等多个领域的实验中，CauchyNet始终优于最先进模型，预测准确率显著提升，平均绝对误差降低50%，且参数更少。

Conclusion: CauchyNet作为一种有效且高效的数据驱动预测建模工具，特别适用于资源受限和数据稀缺环境。

Abstract: A novel neural network inspired by Cauchy's integral formula, is proposed for
function approximation tasks that include time series forecasting, missing data
imputation, etc. Hence, the novel neural network is named CauchyNet. By
embedding real-valued data into the complex plane, CauchyNet efficiently
captures complex temporal dependencies, surpassing traditional real-valued
models in both predictive performance and computational efficiency. Grounded in
Cauchy's integral formula and supported by the universal approximation theorem,
CauchyNet offers strong theoretical guarantees for function approximation. The
architecture incorporates complex-valued activation functions, enabling robust
learning from incomplete data while maintaining a compact parameter footprint
and reducing computational overhead. Through extensive experiments in diverse
domains, including transportation, energy consumption, and epidemiological
data, CauchyNet consistently outperforms state-of-the-art models in predictive
accuracy, often achieving a 50% lower mean absolute error with fewer
parameters. These findings highlight CauchyNet's potential as an effective and
efficient tool for data-driven predictive modeling, particularly in
resource-constrained and data-scarce environments.

TL;DR: 提出RLFR方法，通过从潜在空间构建流场来生成流程奖励，解决RLVR中二进制验证忽略有价值探索的问题，利用离策略高质量数据和在线拒绝采样数据构建流场，量化策略潜在速度偏差作为奖励信号。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RLVR方法使用二进制验证优化策略容易忽略推理轨迹中的有价值探索，而构建黄金过程奖励模型(PRMs)的标注成本高昂，需要探索使用辅助信号进行过程令牌奖励塑造的新方法。

Method: 从潜在空间构建流场，使用离策略高质量数据和在线拒绝采样数据建立流场，量化策略潜在速度偏差作为奖励信号，利用隐藏状态中压缩的高效上下文依赖关系。

Result: 在语言和多模态推理基准测试中验证了流程奖励的可靠性，表明构建良好的流场可以作为奖励信号收集的有效环境。

Conclusion: RLFR展示了潜在空间在奖励塑造中的未充分开发潜力，提供了一种使用辅助信号进行奖励塑造的有前景范式，能够压缩任何离策略专家数据作为奖励信号参考。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has recently emerged as
a promising framework for improving reasoning abilities in Large Language
Models (LLMs). However, policy optimized with binary verification prone to
overlook potential valuable exploration in reasoning trajectory. In view of
heavy annotation cost of golden Process Reward Models (PRMs), recent works
attempt using auxiliary signals for reward shaping of process tokens, involving
entropy and likelihood collected from logit space. In this work, we offer a
novel perspective on shaping RLVR with flow rewards derived from latent space,
and propose RLFR, where the flow fields of model latents are constructed from
either off-policy high-quality data and on-policy rejection sampling data, and
the velocity deviations of policy latents within it are quantified to serve as
a reward signal. RLFR first demonstrates that a well-established flow field can
be a sound environment for reward signal collection, highlighting the
expressive latent space is much underexplored. Moreover, RLFR is able to
compress any off-policy expert data as reference for constituting reward
signals, and we show that the efficient context dependence compressed within
the hidden states are utilized, rather than individual token-level denotation
for context comprehending. Experiments on both language and multimodal
reasoning benchmarks demonstrate the reliability of flow rewards, and
suggesting a promising paradigm for reward shaping with auxiliary signals.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GraphBFN是一个基于贝叶斯流网络的分子图生成框架，通过引入累积分布函数统一训练目标和采样舍入操作，解决了连续扩散模型在分子生成中训练与推理不一致的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前主流的连续扩散模型在分子图生成中，训练时预测连续数值（回归任务），而推理时需要舍入到离散类别，这种训练目标与推理过程的不一致导致模型过度关注点对点精度，限制了分子多样性和泛化能力。

Method: 提出GraphBFN框架，基于贝叶斯流网络，在分布参数上操作，通过引入累积分布函数计算选择正确类别的概率，从而统一训练目标和采样舍入操作。

Result: 在QM9和ZINC250k分子图生成基准测试中取得了最先进的性能，并实现了更快的生成速度。

Conclusion: GraphBFN通过统一训练和推理过程，有效解决了连续扩散模型在分子图生成中的根本限制，提升了生成质量和效率。

Abstract: Molecular graph generation is essentially a classification generation
problem, aimed at predicting categories of atoms and bonds. Currently,
prevailing paradigms such as continuous diffusion models are trained to predict
continuous numerical values, treating the training process as a regression
task. However, the final generation necessitates a rounding step to convert
these predictions back into discrete classification categories, which is
intrinsically a classification operation. Given that the rounding operation is
not incorporated during training, there exists a significant discrepancy
between the model's training objective and its inference procedure. As a
consequence, an excessive emphasis on point-wise precision can lead to
overfitting and inefficient learning. This occurs because considerable efforts
are devoted to capturing intra-bin variations that are ultimately irrelevant to
the discrete nature of the task at hand. Such a flaw results in diminished
molecular diversity and constrains the model's generalization capabilities. To
address this fundamental limitation, we propose GraphBFN, a novel hierarchical
coarse-to-fine framework based on Bayesian Flow Networks that operates on the
parameters of distributions. By innovatively introducing Cumulative
Distribution Function, GraphBFN is capable of calculating the probability of
selecting the correct category, thereby unifying the training objective with
the sampling rounding operation. We demonstrate that our method achieves
superior performance and faster generation, setting new state-of-the-art
results on the QM9 and ZINC250k molecular graph generation benchmarks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了统计哥德尔机（SGM），这是首个用于递归编辑的统计安全层，用统计置信度测试替代基于证明的要求，在选定置信水平下仅当确认改进时才允许修改，同时分配全局错误预算来限制累积风险。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 递归自修改在AutoML、神经架构搜索和自适应优化中日益重要，但现有框架无法确保此类更改的安全性。哥德尔机通过要求形式化改进证明来提供原则性保障，但在随机高维环境中此类证明无法获得。

Method: 引入统计哥德尔机（SGM），用统计置信度测试（e值、Hoeffding界）替代证明要求；提出确认触发调和支出（CTHS），通过确认事件而非轮次来索引支出，将错误预算集中在有希望的编辑上。

Result: 在监督学习、强化学习和黑盒优化的实验中验证了SGM的作用：在CIFAR-100上认证了真实增益，在ImageNet-100上拒绝了虚假改进，在RL和优化基准上展示了鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 这些结果将SGM定位为学习系统中持续、风险感知自修改的基础设施。

Abstract: Recursive self-modification is increasingly central in AutoML, neural
architecture search, and adaptive optimization, yet no existing framework
ensures that such changes are made safely. Godel machines offer a principled
safeguard by requiring formal proofs of improvement before rewriting code;
however, such proofs are unattainable in stochastic, high-dimensional settings.
We introduce the Statistical Godel Machine (SGM), the first statistical safety
layer for recursive edits. SGM replaces proof-based requirements with
statistical confidence tests (e-values, Hoeffding bounds), admitting a
modification only when superiority is certified at a chosen confidence level,
while allocating a global error budget to bound cumulative risk across
rounds.We also propose Confirm-Triggered Harmonic Spending (CTHS), which
indexes spending by confirmation events rather than rounds, concentrating the
error budget on promising edits while preserving familywise
validity.Experiments across supervised learning, reinforcement learning, and
black-box optimization validate this role: SGM certifies genuine gains on
CIFAR-100, rejects spurious improvement on ImageNet-100, and demonstrates
robustness on RL and optimization benchmarks.Together, these results position
SGM as foundational infrastructure for continual, risk-aware self-modification
in learning systems.Code is available at:

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出PSCNet网络，结合ERA5-Land高时间分辨率数据对SMAP土壤湿度产品进行时空降尺度，在青藏高原获得10km空间分辨率和3小时时间分辨率的无缝土壤湿度产品。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决土壤湿度时间尺度反演中地表辅助因子不完整的问题，提高土壤湿度的时空分辨率。

Method: 设计渐进尺度卷积网络(PSCNet)，包含多频时间融合模块(MFTF)捕捉时间动态，以及定制的挤压激励(SE)模块保留空间细节。

Result: 在青藏高原验证中，PSCNet表现最佳：卫星产品验证R值0.881；站点验证R指标排名前三；时间泛化验证相对误差小于6%；时空动态可视化显示优秀性能。

Conclusion: PSCNet通过有效建模土壤湿度数据的复杂时空关系，为时空降尺度提供了有前景的解决方案。

Abstract: Soil moisture (SM) plays a critical role in hydrological and meteorological
processes. High-resolution SM can be obtained by combining coarse passive
microwave data with fine-scale auxiliary variables. However, the inversion of
SM at the temporal scale is hindered by the incompleteness of surface auxiliary
factors. To address this issue, first, we introduce validated high temporal
resolution ERA5-Land variables into the downscaling process of the
low-resolution SMAP SM product. Subsequently, we design a progressive scale
convolutional network (PSCNet), at the core of which are two innovative
components: a multi-frequency temporal fusion module (MFTF) for capturing
temporal dynamics, and a bespoke squeeze-and-excitation (SE) block designed to
preserve fine-grained spatial details. Using this approach, we obtained
seamless SM products for the Tibetan Plateau (TP) from 2016 to 2018 at 10-km
spatial and 3-hour temporal resolution. The experimental results on the TP
demonstrated the following: 1) In the satellite product validation, the PSCNet
exhibited comparable accuracy and lower error, with a mean R value of 0.881,
outperforming other methods. 2) In the in-situ site validation, PSCNet
consistently ranked among the top three models for the R metric across all
sites, while also showing superior performance in overall error reduction. 3)
In the temporal generalization validation, the feasibility of using
high-temporal resolution ERA5-Land variables for downscaling was confirmed, as
all methods maintained an average relative error within 6\% for the R metric
and 2\% for the ubRMSE metric. 4) In the temporal dynamics and visualization
validation, PSCNet demonstrated excellent temporal sensitivity and vivid
spatial details. Overall, PSCNet provides a promising solution for
spatio-temporal downscaling by effectively modeling the intricate
spatio-temporal relationships in SM data.

Conclusion: MPPReasoner显著提升了分子性质预测的性能、可解释性和实用性，为化学家提供了有价值的分子性质分析见解，增强了模型的实际应用价值。

Abstract: Molecular property prediction is crucial for drug discovery and materials
science, yet existing approaches suffer from limited interpretability, poor
cross-task generalization, and lack of chemical reasoning capabilities.
Traditional machine learning models struggle with task transferability, while
specialized molecular language models provide little insight into their
decision-making processes. To address these limitations, we propose
\textbf{MPPReasoner}, a multimodal large language model that incorporates
chemical reasoning for molecular property prediction. Our approach, built upon
Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct, integrates molecular images with SMILES strings to
enable comprehensive molecular understanding. We develop a two-stage training
strategy: supervised fine-tuning (SFT) using 16,000 high-quality reasoning
trajectories generated through expert knowledge and multiple teacher models,
followed by Reinforcement Learning from Principle-Guided Rewards (RLPGR). RLPGR
employs verifiable, rule-based rewards that systematically evaluate chemical
principle application, molecular structure analysis, and logical consistency
through computational verification. Extensive experiments across 8 datasets
demonstrate significant performance improvements, with MPPReasoner
outperforming the best baselines by 7.91\% and 4.53\% on in-distribution and
out-of-distribution tasks respectively. MPPReasoner exhibits exceptional
cross-task generalization and generates chemically sound reasoning paths that
provide valuable insights into molecular property analysis, substantially
enhancing both interpretability and practical utility for chemists. Code is

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度模型通常针对单一规模的问题进行训练和评估，这严重限制了它们在不同问题规模间的泛化能力，阻碍了实际应用。

Method: 设计了任务间正则化方案来保留小规模问题的知识，任务内正则化方案通过模仿最新期望行为来巩固模型，并利用经验回放来缓解灾难性遗忘。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在各种问题规模（包括训练中未见过的规模）上取得了显著优于现有深度模型的性能。

Conclusion: 该框架通过协同设计有效提升了车辆路径问题深度模型的泛化能力，消融研究验证了各设计组件的协同效应。

Abstract: Exploring machine learning techniques for addressing vehicle routing problems
has attracted considerable research attention. To achieve decent and efficient
solutions, existing deep models for vehicle routing problems are typically
trained and evaluated using instances of a single size. This substantially
limits their ability to generalize across different problem sizes and thus
hampers their practical applicability. To address the issue, we propose a
continual learning based framework that sequentially trains a deep model with
instances of ascending problem sizes. Specifically, on the one hand, we design
an inter-task regularization scheme to retain the knowledge acquired from
smaller problem sizes in the model training on a larger size. On the other
hand, we introduce an intra-task regularization scheme to consolidate the model
by imitating the latest desirable behaviors during training on each size.
Additionally, we exploit the experience replay to revisit instances of formerly
trained sizes for mitigating the catastrophic forgetting. Experimental results
show that our approach achieves predominantly superior performance across
various problem sizes (either seen or unseen in the training), as compared to
state-of-the-art deep models including the ones specialized for
generalizability enhancement. Meanwhile, the ablation studies on the key
designs manifest their synergistic effect in the proposed framework.

*Nikolaus Salvatore,Hao Wang,Qiong Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LLMs在长文本中表现出'中间信息丢失'现象，这与人类记忆的首因效应和近因效应相似。研究发现这不是简单的信息丢失缺陷，而是预训练中不同信息检索需求（长期记忆vs短期记忆）的适应结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究LLMs在长文本处理中表现出的位置偏见现象，特别是中间信息性能下降的原因，理解这是否反映了类似人类记忆的机制。

Method: 使用GPT-2和Llama变体从头开始训练，在模拟长期和短期记忆需求的简单人类记忆范式上进行实验，分析序列完成任务中的表现。

Result: 发现U形性能曲线确实出现，近因效应与训练数据中的短期记忆需求直接对应，而首因效应由均匀长期记忆需求诱导，并受自回归特性和注意力汇聚点形成的影响。

Conclusion: 信息检索需求、模型架构和训练过程中的结构注意力动态共同导致了LLMs中观察到的位置偏见，这种现象反映了模型对不同记忆需求的适应性。

Abstract: The performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) often degrades when crucial
information is in the middle of a long context, a "lost-in-the-middle"
phenomenon that mirrors the primacy and recency effects in human memory. We
propose that this behavior is not simply a flaw indicative of information loss
but an adaptation to different information retrieval demands during
pre-training: some tasks require uniform recall across the entire input (a
long-term memory demand), while others prioritize the most recent information
(a short-term memory demand). Consistent with this view, we show that this
U-shaped performance curve emerges when LLMs (GPT-2 and Llama variants) are
trained from scratch on two simple human memory paradigms simulating long-term
and short-term memory demands. Our analysis reveals that while the recency
effect directly aligns with short-term memory demand in the training data, the
primacy effect is induced by the uniform long-term memory demand and is
additionally influenced by the model's autoregressive properties and the
formation of attention sinks. Our main findings from simple human memory
paradigms also generalize to a sequence completion task, which more closely
resembles the next-token prediction process in LLM pre-training. Together, our
findings reveal how information retrieval demands, model architecture, and
structural attention dynamics during model training can jointly produce
positional bias observed in LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前医学基准测试主要评估知识回忆，而临床推理是假设驱动的过程，需要从有限信息中通过针对性询问、检查和诊断来完善诊断。需要评估LLM在不确定性下的顺序临床推理能力。

Method: 引入VivaBench基准，包含1762个医生策划的临床小故事，模拟医学培训中的口头考试场景，要求代理主动探查相关发现、选择适当检查，并在多个步骤中综合信息以达成诊断。

Result: 当前LLM在描述完整的临床表现时诊断能力尚可，但在不确定性下进行迭代诊断推理时性能显著下降。识别出四种失败模式：初始假设固着、不当检查排序、过早诊断闭合、未能筛查关键病症。

Conclusion: VivaBench为评估对话式医学AI系统提供了标准化基准，揭示了当前LLM在不确定性下推理和决策的基本局限性，有助于推动代理AI在复杂决策环境中的研究。

Abstract: Clinical reasoning in medicine is a hypothesis-driven process where
physicians refine diagnoses from limited information through targeted history,
physical examination, and diagnostic investigations. In contrast, current
medical benchmarks for large language models (LLMs) primarily assess knowledge
recall through single-turn questions, where complete clinical information is
provided upfront. To address this gap, we introduce VivaBench, a multi-turn
benchmark that evaluates sequential clinical reasoning in LLM agents. Our
dataset consists of 1762 physician-curated clinical vignettes structured as
interactive scenarios that simulate a (oral) examination in medical training,
requiring agents to actively probe for relevant findings, select appropriate
investigations, and synthesize information across multiple steps to reach a
diagnosis. While current LLMs demonstrate competence in diagnosing conditions
from well-described clinical presentations, their performance degrades
significantly when required to navigate iterative diagnostic reasoning under
uncertainty in our evaluation. Our analysis identified several failure modes
that mirror common cognitive errors in clinical practice, including: (1)
fixation on initial hypotheses, (2) inappropriate investigation ordering, (3)
premature diagnostic closure, and (4) failing to screen for critical
conditions. These patterns reveal fundamental limitations in how current LLMs
reason and make decisions under uncertainty. Through VivaBench, we provide a
standardized benchmark for evaluating conversational medical AI systems for
real-world clinical decision support. Beyond medical applications, we
contribute to the larger corpus of research on agentic AI by demonstrating how
sequential reasoning trajectories can diverge in complex decision-making
environments.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决语言模型代理在新环境中样本效率低的问题，特别是在交互成本高的场景中，如与人类交互或重置物理系统。

Method: 采用事后经验回放机制，包含两个组件：事后规则（识别相关子目标并生成优化轨迹）和更新规则（维护压缩的轨迹表示）。

Result: 在XMiniGrid和PeopleJoinQA基准测试中，ECHO比基础语言代理基线性能提升高达80%，在XMiniGrid中超越了Reflexion和AWM等复杂代理架构。

Conclusion: ECHO通过更有效地利用过去经验，实现了在新环境中更快的适应能力，证明了事后优化在提升语言模型代理样本效率方面的有效性。

Abstract: Language model (LM) agents deployed in novel environments often exhibit poor
sample efficiency when learning from sequential interactions. This
significantly hinders the usefulness of such agents in environments where
interaction is costly (for example, when they interact with humans or reset
physical systems). While a number of existing LM agent architectures
incorporate various mechanisms for experience storage and reflection, they make
limited use of LMs' abilities to directly generate or reason about full
counterfactual trajectories. We introduce ECHO (Experience Consolidation via
Hindsight Optimization), a prompting framework that adapts hindsight experience
replay from reinforcement learning for language model agents. ECHO generates
optimized trajectories for alternative goals that could have been achieved
during failed attempts, effectively creating synthetic positive examples from
unsuccessful interactions. Our approach consists of two components: a hindsight
rule that uses the language model itself to identify relevant subgoals and
generate optimized trajectories, and an update rule that maintains compressed
trajectory representations in memory. We evaluate ECHO on stateful versions of
XMiniGrid, a text-based navigation and planning benchmark, and PeopleJoinQA, a
collaborative information-gathering enterprise simulation. Across both domains,
ECHO outperforms vanilla language agent baselines by up to 80%; in XMiniGrid,
it also outperforms a number of sophisticated agent architectures including
Reflexion and AWM, demonstrating faster adaptation to novel environments
through more effective utilization of past experiences.

Result: 在分子性质预测和宇宙学参数推断两个科学领域的应用中，多视图图元组模型比单图基线表现更好。

Conclusion: 多视图方法具有更强的表达能力和更低的oracle风险，展示了其在实际应用中的强大能力和通用性。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) typically scale with the number of graph edges,
making them well suited for sparse graphs but less efficient on dense graphs,
such as point clouds or molecular interactions. A common remedy is to sparsify
the graph via similarity thresholding or distance pruning, but this forces an
arbitrary choice of a single interaction scale and discards crucial information
from other scales. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a multi-view
graph-tuple framework. Instead of a single graph, our graph-tuple framework
partitions the graph into disjoint subgraphs, capturing primary local
interactions and weaker, long-range connections. We then learn multi-view
representations from the graph-tuple via a heterogeneous message-passing
architecture inspired by the theory of non-commuting operators, which we
formally prove is strictly more expressive and guarantees a lower oracle risk
compared to single-graph message-passing models. We instantiate our framework
on two scientific domains: molecular property prediction from feature-scarce
Coulomb matrices and cosmological parameter inference from geometric point
clouds. On both applications, our multi-view graph-tuple models demonstrate
better performance than single-graph baselines, highlighting the power and
versatility of our multi-view approach.

Method: 使用基于transformer的模型分析来自消费级可穿戴设备或非接触式无线传感器的睡眠数据，推断抗抑郁药物的摄入情况。

Result: 在包含62,000个夜晚、>20,000名参与者（1,800名抗抑郁药物使用者）的六个数据集中，该生物标志物达到AUROC = 0.84，能够跨药物类别泛化，随剂量变化而扩展，并对伴随的精神药物保持稳健。纵向监测捕捉了现实世界中的用药开始、减量和漏服情况。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了客观、可扩展的依从性监测，具有改善抑郁症治疗和预后的潜力。

Abstract: Antidepressant nonadherence is pervasive, driving relapse, hospitalization,
suicide risk, and billions in avoidable costs. Clinicians need tools that
detect adherence lapses promptly, yet current methods are either invasive
(serum assays, neuroimaging) or proxy-based and inaccurate (pill counts,
pharmacy refills). We present the first noninvasive biomarker that detects
antidepressant intake from a single night of sleep. A transformer-based model
analyzes sleep data from a consumer wearable or contactless wireless sensor to
infer antidepressant intake, enabling remote, effortless, daily adherence
assessment at home. Across six datasets comprising 62,000 nights from >20,000
participants (1,800 antidepressant users), the biomarker achieved AUROC = 0.84,
generalized across drug classes, scaled with dose, and remained robust to
concomitant psychotropics. Longitudinal monitoring captured real-world
initiation, tapering, and lapses. This approach offers objective, scalable
adherence surveillance with potential to improve depression care and outcomes.

Result: 建立了比现有结果更紧的遗憾界，识别了严格次高斯分布类别以获得更尖锐的保证，提出了利用侧信息的可证明保证算法。

Conclusion: 探索无关分配是多组均值估计的原则性和高效方法，在实验设计、个性化等需要准确多组推断的领域具有应用潜力。

Abstract: We address the problem of multi-group mean estimation, which seeks to
allocate a finite sampling budget across multiple groups to obtain uniformly
accurate estimates of their means. Unlike classical multi-armed bandits, whose
objective is to minimize regret by identifying and exploiting the best arm, the
optimal allocation in this setting requires sampling every group on the order
of $\Theta(T)$ times. This fundamental distinction makes exploration-free
algorithms both natural and effective. Our work makes three contributions.
First, we strengthen the existing results on subgaussian variance concentration
using the Hanson-Wright inequality and identify a class of strictly subgaussian
distributions that yield sharper guarantees. Second, we design exploration-free
non-adaptive and adaptive algorithms, and we establish tighter regret bounds
than the existing results. Third, we extend the framework to contextual bandit
settings, an underexplored direction, and propose algorithms that leverage side
information with provable guarantees. Overall, these results position
exploration-free allocation as a principled and efficient approach to
multi-group mean estimation, with potential applications in experimental
design, personalization, and other domains requiring accurate multi-group
inference.

### [111] [Applying non-negative matrix factorization with covariates to label matrix for classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10375)
*Kenichi Satoh*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: NMF-LAB是一种新颖的监督非负矩阵分解方法，将分类问题重新定义为非负矩阵三因子分解的逆问题，直接从协变量映射到标签概率，无需额外分类器。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的非负矩阵分解方法是无监督的，无法直接利用类别标签。现有的监督或半监督扩展通常通过惩罚项或图约束来整合标签，但仍需要外部分类器。

Method: NMF-LAB将标签矩阵Y作为观测值进行因子分解，而协变量A作为给定的解释变量。该方法通过非负矩阵三因子分解的逆问题直接获得类别成员概率，支持核相似度和半监督学习。

Result: 在多个数据集上的实验表明，NMF-LAB在预测准确性、对噪声或不完整标签的鲁棒性以及高维问题的可扩展性方面具有竞争力，同时保持可解释性。

Conclusion: NMF-LAB通过将回归和分类统一在三因子NMF框架中，为现代分类任务提供了一种新颖、概率性和可扩展的方法。

Abstract: Non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) is widely used for dimensionality
reduction and interpretable analysis, but standard formulations are
unsupervised and cannot directly exploit class labels. Existing supervised or
semi-supervised extensions usually incorporate labels only via penalties or
graph constraints, still requiring an external classifier. We propose
\textit{NMF-LAB} (Non-negative Matrix Factorization for Label Matrix), which
redefines classification as the inverse problem of non-negative matrix
tri-factorization (tri-NMF). Unlike joint NMF methods, which reconstruct both
features and labels, NMF-LAB directly factorizes the label matrix $Y$ as the
observation, while covariates $A$ are treated as given explanatory variables.
This yields a direct probabilistic mapping from covariates to labels,
distinguishing our method from label-matrix factorization approaches that
mainly model label correlations or impute missing labels. Our inversion offers
two key advantages: (i) class-membership probabilities are obtained directly
from the factorization without a separate classifier, and (ii) covariates,
including kernel-based similarities, can be seamlessly integrated to generalize
predictions to unseen samples. In addition, unlabeled data can be encoded as
uniform distributions, supporting semi-supervised learning. Experiments on
diverse datasets, from small-scale benchmarks to the large-scale MNIST dataset,
demonstrate that NMF-LAB achieves competitive predictive accuracy, robustness
to noisy or incomplete labels, and scalability to high-dimensional problems,
while preserving interpretability. By unifying regression and classification
within the tri-NMF framework, NMF-LAB provides a novel, probabilistic, and
scalable approach to modern classification tasks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TreeDiff是一个基于蒙特卡洛树搜索的双空间扩散框架，用于可控图生成，通过宏步扩展、双空间去噪和双空间验证器实现高效可控的图生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的扩散模型在图生成中缺乏对期望属性的控制能力，导致质量不稳定且难以融入新目标。推理时引导方法虽然无需重新训练，但仍然是局部、启发式的，可控性有限。

Method: 提出TreeDiff框架：1）宏步扩展策略将多个去噪更新分组为单个转换；2）双空间去噪机制结合潜在空间高效去噪和图空间轻量离散校正；3）双空间验证器从部分去噪图中预测长期奖励。

Result: 在2D和3D分子生成基准测试中，无论是无条件还是有条件设置下，TreeDiff都实现了最先进的性能，并且推理时间扩展性良好，随着计算资源增加性能持续提升。

Conclusion: TreeDiff通过MCTS引导的双空间扩散框架有效解决了图生成中的可控性问题，在保持计算可处理性的同时扩展了搜索空间，实现了优越的性能和可扩展性。

Abstract: Graph generation is a fundamental problem in graph learning with broad
applications across Web-scale systems, knowledge graphs, and scientific domains
such as drug and material discovery. Recent approaches leverage diffusion
models for step-by-step generation, yet unconditional diffusion offers little
control over desired properties, often leading to unstable quality and
difficulty in incorporating new objectives. Inference-time guidance methods
mitigate these issues by adjusting the sampling process without retraining, but
they remain inherently local, heuristic, and limited in controllability. To
overcome these limitations, we propose TreeDiff, a Monte Carlo Tree Search
(MCTS) guided dual-space diffusion framework for controllable graph generation.
TreeDiff is a plug-and-play inference-time method that expands the search space
while keeping computation tractable. Specifically, TreeDiff introduces three
key designs to make it practical and scalable: (1) a macro-step expansion
strategy that groups multiple denoising updates into a single transition,
reducing tree depth and enabling long-horizon exploration; (2) a dual-space
denoising mechanism that couples efficient latent-space denoising with
lightweight discrete correction in graph space, ensuring both scalability and
structural fidelity; and (3) a dual-space verifier that predicts long-term
rewards from partially denoised graphs, enabling early value estimation and
removing the need for full rollouts. Extensive experiments on 2D and 3D
molecular generation benchmarks, under both unconditional and conditional
settings, demonstrate that TreeDiff achieves state-of-the-art performance.
Notably, TreeDiff exhibits favorable inference-time scaling: it continues to
improve with additional computation, while existing inference-time methods
plateau early under limited resources.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文研究发现，即使在非线性softmax激活和分类任务的更现实场景下，transformers仍然通过上下文学习执行梯度下降，但是在核特征空间中的函数上进行，且softmax transformer具有上下文自适应学习率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有理论研究主要基于简化的线性自注意力和连续回归任务，而transformers通常在离散复杂任务上训练。本文旨在弥合这一差距，研究在分类任务和非线性softmax激活下的上下文学习机制。

Method: 通过理论分析研究transformers在分类任务中的上下文学习算法，特别关注非线性softmax激活的情况，并进行实证验证和消融研究。

Result: 发现transformers仍然学习在核特征空间的函数上进行梯度下降，softmax transformer具有上下文自适应学习率，表现出更强的上下文适应能力。

Conclusion: 这些发现增强了在更现实设置下对上下文学习算法的理论理解，推动了直觉发展，并为向更大模型的理论延伸奠定了基础。

Abstract: The remarkable ability of transformers to learn new concepts solely by
reading examples within the input prompt, termed in-context learning (ICL), is
a crucial aspect of intelligent behavior. Here, we focus on understanding the
learning algorithm transformers use to learn from context. Existing theoretical
work, often based on simplifying assumptions, has primarily focused on linear
self-attention and continuous regression tasks, finding transformers can learn
in-context by gradient descent. Given that transformers are typically trained
on discrete and complex tasks, we bridge the gap from this existing work to the
setting of classification, with non-linear (importantly, softmax) activation.
We find that transformers still learn to do gradient descent in-context, though
on functionals in the kernel feature space and with a context-adaptive learning
rate in the case of softmax transformer. These theoretical findings suggest a
greater adaptability to context for softmax attention, which we empirically
verify and study through ablations. Overall, we hope this enhances theoretical
understanding of in-context learning algorithms in more realistic settings,
pushes forward our intuitions and enables further theory bridging to larger
models.

TL;DR: HiLoMoE是一个分层LoRA MoE框架，通过参数高效的方式实现整体扩展，结合了垂直扩展和水平扩展的优势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决垂直扩展中逐层顺序计算带来的效率挑战，以及水平扩展中平坦MoE层难以捕捉推荐任务层次结构的问题，探索两种扩展方向的互补优势。

Method: 使用轻量级rank-1专家进行参数高效的水平扩展，通过分层路由堆叠多个MoE层实现组合多样的专家组合，基于前层分数而非输出进行路由以实现并行执行。

Result: 在四个公共数据集上，HiLoMoE实现了更好的性能-效率权衡，相比非MoE基线平均AUC提升0.20%，FLOPs减少18.5%。

Conclusion: HiLoMoE框架通过分层LoRA MoE设计，在保持参数效率的同时实现了更好的性能和计算效率平衡。

Abstract: Deep models have driven significant advances in click-through rate (CTR)
prediction. While vertical scaling via layer stacking improves model
expressiveness, the layer-by-layer sequential computation poses challenges to
efficient scaling. Conversely, horizontal scaling through Mixture of Experts
(MoE) achieves efficient scaling by activating a small subset of experts in
parallel, but flat MoE layers may struggle to capture the hierarchical
structure inherent in recommendation tasks. To push the Return-On-Investment
(ROI) boundary, we explore the complementary strengths of both directions and
propose HiLoMoE, a hierarchical LoRA MoE framework that enables holistic
scaling in a parameter-efficient manner. Specifically, HiLoMoE employs
lightweight rank-1 experts for parameter-efficient horizontal scaling, and
stacks multiple MoE layers with hierarchical routing to enable combinatorially
diverse expert compositions. Unlike conventional stacking, HiLoMoE routes based
on prior layer scores rather than outputs, allowing all layers to execute in
parallel. A principled three-stage training framework ensures stable
optimization and expert diversity. Experiments on four public datasets show
that HiLoMoE achieving better performance-efficiency tradeoff, achieving an
average AUC improvement of 0.20\% in AUC and 18.5\% reduction in FLOPs compared
to the non-MoE baseline.

Motivation: 现有多任务学习框架未考虑特征相关性的时变特性，限制了阿尔茨海默病纵向数据建模的效果

Method: 引入特征相似性拉普拉斯惩罚项，同时考虑任务间的时间平滑性和特征间的动态相关性，采用ADMM算法求解非光滑优化问题

Result: 在ADNI数据集上实验表明，MTL-FSL框架达到最先进性能，优于多种基线方法

Conclusion: MTL-FSL框架能有效建模特征间的时间变化关系，为阿尔茨海默病预测提供更准确和可解释的解决方案

Abstract: Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is the most prevalent neurodegenerative disorder in
aging populations, posing a significant and escalating burden on global
healthcare systems. While Multi-Tusk Learning (MTL) has emerged as a powerful
computational paradigm for modeling longitudinal AD data, existing frameworks
do not account for the time-varying nature of feature correlations. To address
this limitation, we propose a novel MTL framework, named Feature Similarity
Laplacian graph Multi-Task Learning (MTL-FSL). Our framework introduces a novel
Feature Similarity Laplacian (FSL) penalty that explicitly models the
time-varying relationships between features. By simultaneously considering
temporal smoothness among tasks and the dynamic correlations among features,
our model enhances both predictive accuracy and biological interpretability. To
solve the non-smooth optimization problem arising from our proposed penalty
terms, we adopt the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM)
algorithm. Experiments conducted on the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging
Initiative (ADNI) dataset demonstrate that our proposed MTL-FSL framework
achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming various baseline methods.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文分析了反向监督策略的复杂性，证明即使有量子计算等加速技术，监督学习仍需要人类提供初始标签和先验知识。生成式AI可作为标签放大器，但人类监督仍是必要的。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究在计算速度大幅提升的背景下，机器学习是否仍需要人类监督。探讨反向监督策略的复杂性限制，以及生成式AI在监督学习中的角色。

Method: 分析反向监督策略的搜索空间复杂度，该策略在大型未标记数据集B上搜索标签，以最小化小型标记数据集A上的误差。搜索空间为2^n，即使有常数级加速仍保持指数复杂度。

Result: 计算速度的任意提升（非指数级）无法消除对信息性标签或先验知识的需求。机器学习流程仍需人类指定目标、定义类别并提供代表性标注种子集。

Conclusion: 极端计算速度只能减少运行时间，无法减少学习的基本监督需求。生成式模型可作为标签放大器，但初始的人类（或人类级）输入对于将系统锚定在预期任务中仍是必要的。

Abstract: We analyze a reversed-supervision strategy that searches over labelings of a
large unlabeled set \(B\) to minimize error on a small labeled set \(A\). The
search space is \(2^n\), and the resulting complexity remains exponential even
under large constant-factor speedups (e.g., quantum or massively parallel
hardware). Consequently, arbitrarily fast -- but not exponentially faster --
computation does not obviate the need for informative labels or priors. In
practice, the machine learning pipeline still requires an initial human
contribution: specifying the objective, defining classes, and providing a seed
set of representative annotations that inject inductive bias and align models
with task semantics. Synthetic labels from generative AI can partially
substitute provided their quality is human-grade and anchored by a
human-specified objective, seed supervision, and validation. In this view,
generative models function as \emph{label amplifiers}, leveraging small
human-curated cores via active, semi-supervised, and self-training loops, while
humans retain oversight for calibration, drift detection, and failure auditing.
Thus, extreme computational speed reduces wall-clock time but not the
fundamental supervision needs of learning; initial human (or human-grade) input
remains necessary to ground the system in the intended task.

Abstract: Simulators of animal movements play a valuable role in studying behavior.
Advances in imitation learning for robotics have expanded possibilities for
reproducing human and animal movements. A key challenge for realistic
multi-animal simulation in biology is bridging the gap between unknown
real-world transition models and their simulated counterparts. Because
locomotion dynamics are seldom known, relying solely on mathematical models is
insufficient; constructing a simulator that both reproduces real trajectories
and supports reward-driven optimization remains an open problem. We introduce a
data-driven simulator for multi-animal behavior based on deep reinforcement
learning and counterfactual simulation. We address the ill-posed nature of the
problem caused by high degrees of freedom in locomotion by estimating movement
variables of an incomplete transition model as actions within an RL framework.
We also employ a distance-based pseudo-reward to align and compare states
between cyber and physical spaces. Validated on artificial agents, flies,
newts, and silkmoth, our approach achieves higher reproducibility of
species-specific behaviors and improved reward acquisition compared with
standard imitation and RL methods. Moreover, it enables counterfactual behavior
prediction in novel experimental settings and supports multi-individual
modeling for flexible what-if trajectory generation, suggesting its potential
to simulate and elucidate complex multi-animal behaviors.

Result: 在9个物联网相关数据集和4个骨干架构上的广泛实验表明，LightSAE仅增加4.0%参数即可实现高达22.8%的MSE改进。

Conclusion: LightSAE通过利用辅助组件的低秩和聚类特性，有效解决了多变量时间序列预测中的表示瓶颈问题，在保持参数效率的同时显著提升预测性能。

Abstract: Modern Internet of Things (IoT) systems generate massive, heterogeneous
multivariate time series data. Accurate Multivariate Time Series Forecasting
(MTSF) of such data is critical for numerous applications. However, existing
methods almost universally employ a shared embedding layer that processes all
channels identically, creating a representational bottleneck that obscures
valuable channel-specific information. To address this challenge, we introduce
a Shared-Auxiliary Embedding (SAE) framework that decomposes the embedding into
a shared base component capturing common patterns and channel-specific
auxiliary components modeling unique deviations. Within this decomposition, we
\rev{empirically observe} that the auxiliary components tend to exhibit
low-rank and clustering characteristics, a structural pattern that is
significantly less apparent when using purely independent embeddings.
Consequently, we design LightSAE, a parameter-efficient embedding module that
operationalizes these observed characteristics through low-rank factorization
and a shared, gated component pool. Extensive experiments across 9 IoT-related
datasets and 4 backbone architectures demonstrate LightSAE's effectiveness,
achieving MSE improvements of up to 22.8\% with only 4.0\% parameter increase.

Motivation: 大语言模型部署面临内存和延迟瓶颈，需要灵活的量化技术来平衡准确性和效率。多精度模型可以根据运行时约束选择不同精度，但需要硬件友好的实现方式。

Conclusion: AnyBCQ通过算法灵活性与硬件效率的对齐，为多精度LLM部署提供了实用基础，能够满足多样化的服务级别目标。

Abstract: The deployment of large language models (LLMs) is increasingly constrained by
memory and latency bottlenecks, motivating the need for quantization techniques
that flexibly balance accuracy and efficiency. Recent work has introduced
multi-precision models, which enable inference at multiple precisions within a
single model depending on runtime constraints. To support such flexibility,
quantized weights are often stored as bit-planes, where hardware efficiency
improves when the compute operates directly at the bit-plane level and
activates only the precision required by each request. In this work, we present
AnyBCQ, a hardware-friendly multi-precision extension of Binary-Coded
Quantization (BCQ) that supports direct bit-plane operations. By representing
weights as binary bit-planes with corresponding scale factors, AnyBCQ enables
bit-plane-level computation and maps naturally to accelerator-friendly,
bit-parallel arithmetic. Our progressive precision expansion mechanism
incrementally refines scaling factors while reusing previously assigned binary
codes, yielding monotonic improvements in accuracy as additional bits are
enabled. We further co-design a specialized kernel that exploits the BCQ
structure to support dynamic per-request precision selection with negligible
overhead. Experiments on recent LLMs demonstrate that AnyBCQ significantly
narrows the accuracy drop in the low-bit regime (e.g. 2-bit), remains
competitive at higher precision, and achieves throughput gains of up to 3.0x
over half precision and 1.2x over state-of-the-art multi-precision methods. By
aligning algorithmic flexibility with hardware efficiency, AnyBCQ provides a
practical foundation for multi-precision LLM deployment across diverse
service-level objectives.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于锚点的最大差异(AMD)方法，用于相对相似性测试，通过同时学习合适的假设和核函数来解决传统方法中核选择与假设指定顺序的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于核的相对相似性测试方法存在核选择与假设指定顺序的问题：一旦假设被手动指定，总能找到一个核使得该假设被拒绝，这导致相对相似性测试在假设指定后选择良好核时变得不明确。

Method: 提出锚点最大差异(AMD)方法，将相对相似性定义为在深度核空间中(U,P)和(U,Q)距离之间的最大差异。测试分为两个阶段：第一阶段估计深度核空间中的AMD并推断潜在假设；第二阶段评估潜在假设的统计显著性，提出统一测试框架为不同可能假设推导阈值。

Result: 通过理论验证和基准数据集上的广泛实验证明了该方法的有效性。

Conclusion: AMD方法通过同时学习假设和核函数，有效解决了相对相似性测试中核选择与假设指定顺序的挑战，提供了一种更稳健的测试框架。

Abstract: The relative similarity testing aims to determine which of the distributions,
P or Q, is closer to an anchor distribution U. Existing kernel-based approaches
often test the relative similarity with a fixed kernel in a manually specified
alternative hypothesis, e.g., Q is closer to U than P. Although kernel
selection is known to be important to kernel-based testing methods, the
manually specified hypothesis poses a significant challenge for kernel
selection in relative similarity testing: Once the hypothesis is specified
first, we can always find a kernel such that the hypothesis is rejected. This
challenge makes relative similarity testing ill-defined when we want to select
a good kernel after the hypothesis is specified. In this paper, we cope with
this challenge via learning a proper hypothesis and a kernel simultaneously,
instead of learning a kernel after manually specifying the hypothesis. We
propose an anchor-based maximum discrepancy (AMD), which defines the relative
similarity as the maximum discrepancy between the distances of (U, P) and (U,
Q) in a space of deep kernels. Based on AMD, our testing incorporates two
phases. In Phase I, we estimate the AMD over the deep kernel space and infer
the potential hypothesis. In Phase II, we assess the statistical significance
of the potential hypothesis, where we propose a unified testing framework to
derive thresholds for tests over different possible hypotheses from Phase I.
Lastly, we validate our method theoretically and demonstrate its effectiveness
via extensive experiments on benchmark datasets. Codes are publicly available

Abstract: Designing protein binders targeting specific sites, which requires to
generate realistic and functional interaction patterns, is a fundamental
challenge in drug discovery. Current structure-based generative models are
limited in generating nterfaces with sufficient rationality and
interpretability. In this paper, we propose Retrieval-Augmented Diffusion for
Aligned interface (RADiAnce), a new framework that leverages known interfaces
to guide the design of novel binders. By unifying retrieval and generation in a
shared contrastive latent space, our model efficiently identifies relevant
interfaces for a given binding site and seamlessly integrates them through a
conditional latent diffusion generator, enabling cross-domain interface
transfer. Extensive exeriments show that RADiAnce significantly outperforms
baseline models across multiple metrics, including binding affinity and
recovery of geometries and interactions. Additional experimental results
validate cross-domain generalization, demonstrating that retrieving interfaces
from diverse domains, such as peptides, antibodies, and protein fragments,
enhances the generation performance of binders for other domains. Our work
establishes a new paradigm for protein binder design that successfully bridges
retrieval-based knowledge and generative AI, opening new possibilities for drug
discovery.

Abstract: Partial differential equations (PDEs) provide a mathematical foundation for
simulating and understanding intricate behaviors in both physical sciences and
engineering. With the growing capabilities of deep learning, data$-$driven
approaches like Physics$-$Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have been developed,
offering a mesh$-$free, analytic type framework for efficiently solving PDEs
across a wide range of applications. However, traditional PINNs often struggle
with challenges such as limited precision, slow training dynamics, lack of
labeled data availability, and inadequate handling of multi$-$physics
interactions. To overcome these challenging issues of PINNs, we proposed a
Gradient Enhanced Self$-$Training PINN (gST$-$PINN) method that specifically
introduces a gradient based pseudo point self$-$learning algorithm for solving
PDEs. We tested the proposed method on three different types of PDE problems
from various fields, each representing distinct scenarios. The effectiveness of
the proposed method is evident, as the PINN approach for solving the Burgers$'$
equation attains a mean square error (MSE) on the order of $10^{-3}$, while the
diffusion$-$sorption equation achieves an MSE on the order of $10^{-4}$ after
12,500 iterations, with no further improvement as the iterations increase. In
contrast, the MSE for both PDEs in the gST$-$PINN model continues to decrease,
demonstrating better generalization and reaching an MSE on the order of
$10^{-5}$ after 18,500 iterations. Furthermore, the results show that the
proposed purely semi$-$supervised gST$-$PINN consistently outperforms the
standard PINN method in all cases, even when solution of the PDEs are
unavailable. It generalizes both PINN and Gradient$-$enhanced PINN (gPINN), and
can be effectively applied in scenarios prone to low accuracy and convergence
issues, particularly in the absence of labeled data.

*Kanishkha Jaisankar,Sunidhi Tandel*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了Align2Act框架，将指令调优的大语言模型转化为可解释的运动规划器，使其与人类驾驶行为对齐，在真实世界nuPlan基准测试中表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决当前LLM在自动驾驶运动规划中是否真正理解人类驾驶逻辑的问题，旨在开发能够产生可解释决策的规划器。

Method: 基于人类推理模式和交通规则构建结构化驾驶指令，通过Align2ActChain模块进行逐步推理，使用LoRA在nuPlan数据集上微调LLaMA-2-7B模型。

Result: 在nuPlan Test14-random上获得开环评分85.17，闭环评分70.31（非反应式）和66.96（反应式），优于之前的合成或开环设置方法。

Conclusion: 结构化推理显著提升了LLM规划器的性能，证明了将LLM与人类驾驶逻辑对齐的有效性，在真实世界场景中实现了更好的规划质量和人类相似性。

Abstract: Motion planning in complex scenarios is a core challenge in autonomous
driving. Conventional methods apply predefined rules or learn from driving data
to generate trajectories, while recent approaches leverage large language
models (LLMs) for decision-making. However, it remains unclear whether LLMs
truly capture human driving logic. We propose Align2Act, a motion planning
framework that transforms instruction-tuned LLMs into interpretable planners
aligned with human behavior. We derive structured driving instructions based on
human reasoning patterns (e.g., anticipate hazards, yield at intersections) and
traffic rules (e.g., stop at red lights, maintain lane boundaries). Our
Align2ActChain module guides step-by-step reasoning to produce both an
interpretable rationale and a safe trajectory. By fine-tuning LLaMA-2-7B with
LoRA on one million scenarios from the nuPlan dataset, our method achieves an
open-loop score of 85.17 and closed-loop scores of 70.31 (non-reactive) and
66.96 (reactive) on Test14-random. Unlike prior work focused on synthetic or
open-loop settings, we demonstrate improved planning quality and human-likeness
on the real-world nuPlan closed-loop benchmark. Ablation studies confirm that
structured reasoning significantly improves performance over baseline LLM
planners.

TL;DR: 提出了f-influence框架，通过假设检验考虑训练随机性，实现稳定可靠的影响力估计，并开发了f-INE算法在单次训练中计算影响力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有影响力估计方法在训练随机性下不稳定，同一样本在不同运行中可能被判断为关键或无关，这影响了在数据清理等应用中的可靠性。

Method: 引入基于假设检验的f-influence框架，设计f-INE算法在单次训练中高效计算影响力，明确考虑训练随机性。

Result: 成功将f-INE扩展到Llama-3.1-8B模型，可靠检测出操纵模型意见的投毒样本，证明了在数据清理和行为归因中的实用性。

Conclusion: f-influence框架解决了影响力估计的稳定性问题，为机器学习模型的解释和调试提供了可靠工具，特别是在数据清理和模型行为分析方面。

Abstract: Influence estimation methods promise to explain and debug machine learning by
estimating the impact of individual samples on the final model. Yet, existing
methods collapse under training randomness: the same example may appear
critical in one run and irrelevant in the next. Such instability undermines
their use in data curation or cleanup since it is unclear if we indeed
deleted/kept the correct datapoints. To overcome this, we introduce
*f-influence* -- a new influence estimation framework grounded in hypothesis
testing that explicitly accounts for training randomness, and establish
desirable properties that make it suitable for reliable influence estimation.
We also design a highly efficient algorithm **f**-**IN**fluence **E**stimation
(**f-INE**) that computes f-influence **in a single training run**. Finally, we
scale up f-INE to estimate influence of instruction tuning data on Llama-3.1-8B
and show it can reliably detect poisoned samples that steer model opinions,
demonstrating its utility for data cleanup and attributing model behavior.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种新颖的混合框架，通过集成五种增强方法和强化学习动态权重选择，结合先进的校准技术，生成高保真度的医疗合成数据，在保护隐私的同时保持数据统计特性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医疗研究和开发面临数据稀缺和隐私法规（如HIPAA和GDPR）的限制，阻碍了AI模型创新和患者护理的进步。合成数据生成提供了一种保护隐私的解决方案。

Method: 混合框架集成噪声注入、插值、GMM采样、CVAE采样和SMOTE五种增强方法，通过强化学习动态选择权重，采用矩匹配、全直方图匹配、软直方图匹配和迭代精炼等校准技术。

Result: 在乳腺癌和心脏病数据集上，Wasserstein距离低至0.001，KS统计量约0.01，边际差异接近零。下游分类器准确率达94%，F1分数超过93%，与真实数据训练结果相当。

Conclusion: 该方法在保护隐私的同时实现了高保真度的数据合成，为医疗AI应用提供了可扩展的解决方案，并在联合分布保真度方面设立了新基准。

Abstract: Healthcare research and development face significant obstacles due to data
scarcity and stringent privacy regulations, such as HIPAA and the GDPR,
restricting access to essential real-world medical data. These limitations
impede innovation, delay robust AI model creation, and hinder advancements in
patient-centered care. Synthetic data generation offers a transformative
solution by producing artificial datasets that emulate real data statistics
while safeguarding patient privacy. We introduce a novel hybrid framework for
high-fidelity healthcare data synthesis integrating five augmentation methods:
noise injection, interpolation, Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) sampling,
Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE) sampling, and SMOTE, combined via a
reinforcement learning-based dynamic weight selection mechanism. Its key
innovations include advanced calibration techniques -- moment matching, full
histogram matching, soft and adaptive soft histogram matching, and iterative
refinement -- that align marginal distributions and preserve joint feature
dependencies. Evaluated on the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (UCI Repository) and
Khulna Medical College cardiology datasets, our calibrated hybrid achieves
Wasserstein distances as low as 0.001 and Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistics around
0.01, demonstrating near-zero marginal discrepancy. Pairwise trend scores
surpass 90%, and Nearest Neighbor Adversarial Accuracy approaches 50%,
confirming robust privacy protection. Downstream classifiers trained on
synthetic data achieve up to 94% accuracy and F1 scores above 93%, comparable
to models trained on real data. This scalable, privacy-preserving approach
matches state-of-the-art methods, sets new benchmarks for joint-distribution
fidelity in healthcare, and supports sensitive AI applications.

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合强化学习和特征解耦的无监督连续域自适应框架，用于在无显式元数据情况下选择最优的中间域路径，通过基于潜在域嵌入距离的无监督奖励机制提升域适应效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决连续域自适应中无显式元数据时中间域选择的挑战，现有研究对此问题探索不足。

Method: 结合强化学习和特征解耦，使用基于潜在域嵌入距离的无监督奖励机制进行域路径选择，通过特征解耦分离域特定和域不变特征。

Result: 在Rotated MNIST和ADNI数据集上的实验表明，该方法在预测准确率和域选择效率方面显著优于传统连续域自适应方法。

Conclusion: 该集成策略能同时优化传输路径和目标任务性能，有效提升域自适应过程的效果。

Abstract: Continuous Domain Adaptation (CDA) effectively bridges significant domain
shifts by progressively adapting from the source domain through intermediate
domains to the target domain. However, selecting intermediate domains without
explicit metadata remains a substantial challenge that has not been extensively
explored in existing studies. To tackle this issue, we propose a novel
framework that combines reinforcement learning with feature disentanglement to
conduct domain path selection in an unsupervised CDA setting. Our approach
introduces an innovative unsupervised reward mechanism that leverages the
distances between latent domain embeddings to facilitate the identification of
optimal transfer paths. Furthermore, by disentangling features, our method
facilitates the calculation of unsupervised rewards using domain-specific
features and promotes domain adaptation by aligning domain-invariant features.
This integrated strategy is designed to simultaneously optimize transfer paths
and target task performance, enhancing the effectiveness of domain adaptation
processes. Extensive empirical evaluations on datasets such as Rotated MNIST
and ADNI demonstrate substantial improvements in prediction accuracy and domain
selection efficiency, establishing our method's superiority over traditional
CDA approaches.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 当前强化学习基准无法有效评估大语言模型的进展，作者提出诊断套件和Oracle性能差距指标来量化训练集与测试集性能差异，发现现有基准存在泛化能力不足的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准无法可靠区分强化学习进展，因为训练集和测试集性能几乎相同，无法评估真正的泛化能力。

Method: 引入诊断套件和Oracle性能差距(OPG)指标，通过压力测试分析强化学习方法在分布偏移、难度变化和反事实场景下的表现。

Result: 发现尽管基准分数很高，但现有强化学习方法在泛化方面存在严重不足，当前基准无法揭示这些缺陷。

Conclusion: 当前基准不足以评估泛化能力，提出构建更可靠基准的三个核心原则：足够难度、平衡评估和分布鲁棒性。

Abstract: Current benchmarks are inadequate for evaluating progress in reinforcement
learning (RL) for large language models (LLMs).Despite recent benchmark gains
reported for RL, we find that training on these benchmarks' training sets
achieves nearly the same performance as training directly on the test sets,
suggesting that the benchmarks cannot reliably separate further progress.To
study this phenomenon, we introduce a diagnostic suite and the Oracle
Performance Gap (OPG) metric that quantifies the performance difference between
training on the train split versus the test split of a benchmark. We further
analyze this phenomenon with stress tests and find that, despite strong
benchmark scores, existing RL methods struggle to generalize across
distribution shifts, varying levels of difficulty, and counterfactual
scenarios: shortcomings that current benchmarks fail to reveal.We conclude that
current benchmarks are insufficient for evaluating generalization and propose
three core principles for designing more faithful benchmarks: sufficient
difficulty, balanced evaluation, and distributional robustness.

Motivation: 强化学习中数据的序列性质破坏了经典泛化界的独立性假设，需要克服这一挑战来获得有意义的泛化保证。

Method: 推导了包含马尔可夫链混合时间的PAC-Bayesian泛化界，并基于此开发了PB-SAC算法，在训练过程中优化该界来指导探索。

Result: 为现代离策略算法（如Soft Actor-Critic）提供了非空洞的置信证书，在连续控制任务中保持竞争力的同时提供有意义的置信保证。

Conclusion: 该方法成功克服了强化学习中序列数据带来的泛化挑战，为算法提供了实用的置信证书，同时保持了性能竞争力。

Abstract: We derive a novel PAC-Bayesian generalization bound for reinforcement
learning that explicitly accounts for Markov dependencies in the data, through
the chain's mixing time. This contributes to overcoming challenges in obtaining
generalization guarantees for reinforcement learning, where the sequential
nature of data breaks the independence assumptions underlying classical bounds.
Our bound provides non-vacuous certificates for modern off-policy algorithms
like Soft Actor-Critic. We demonstrate the bound's practical utility through
PB-SAC, a novel algorithm that optimizes the bound during training to guide
exploration. Experiments across continuous control tasks show that our approach
provides meaningful confidence certificates while maintaining competitive
performance.

Motivation: 传统通用时间序列模型缺乏病理特异性特征提取能力，且帕金森病症状的时间稀疏性导致关键诊断特征被传统聚合方法稀释，难以准确评估病情严重程度。

Method: 提出多尺度频率感知对抗多实例网络(MFAM)，包含医学先验知识指导的频率分解模块和基于注意力的多实例学习框架，能够自适应关注最具诊断价值的稀疏片段。

Result: 在公共PADS数据集和私有数据集上的实验表明，MFAM在处理复杂临床时间序列方面优于通用时间序列模型，为帕金森病严重程度自动评估提供了有前景的解决方案。

Conclusion: MFAM模型通过结合频率分解和多实例学习，有效解决了帕金森病评估中的特征特异性和时间稀疏性问题，在临床时间序列分析中表现出优越性能。

Abstract: Severity assessment of Parkinson's disease (PD) using wearable sensors offers
an effective, objective basis for clinical management. However, general-purpose
time series models often lack pathological specificity in feature extraction,
making it difficult to capture subtle signals highly correlated with
PD.Furthermore, the temporal sparsity of PD symptoms causes key diagnostic
features to be easily "diluted" by traditional aggregation methods, further
complicating assessment. To address these issues, we propose the Multi-scale
Frequency-Aware Adversarial Multi-Instance Network (MFAM). This model enhances
feature specificity through a frequency decomposition module guided by medical
prior knowledge. Furthermore, by introducing an attention-based multi-instance
learning (MIL) framework, the model can adaptively focus on the most
diagnostically valuable sparse segments.We comprehensively validated MFAM on
both the public PADS dataset for PD versus differential diagnosis (DD) binary
classification and a private dataset for four-class severity assessment.
Experimental results demonstrate that MFAM outperforms general-purpose time
series models in handling complex clinical time series with specificity,
providing a promising solution for automated assessment of PD severity.

Abstract: Self-supervised representation learning has achieved impressive empirical
success, yet its theoretical understanding remains limited. In this work, we
provide a theoretical perspective by formulating self-supervised representation
learning as an approximation to supervised representation learning objectives.
Based on this formulation, we derive a loss function closely related to popular
contrastive losses such as InfoNCE, offering insight into their underlying
principles. Our derivation naturally introduces the concepts of prototype
representation bias and a balanced contrastive loss, which help explain and
improve the behavior of self-supervised learning algorithms. We further show
how components of our theoretical framework correspond to established practices
in contrastive learning. Finally, we empirically validate the effect of
balancing positive and negative pair interactions. All theoretical proofs are
provided in the appendix, and our code is included in the supplementary
material.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一个基于组合对称性的框架，将智能体视为跟踪和压缩感官流的生成程序，通过李伪群的局部作用来描述自然流，并展示了准确的世界跟踪如何施加结构和动力学约束。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 从算法（科尔莫戈罗夫）视角出发，探索智能体如何通过生成程序来跟踪和压缩感官流，并利用组合对称性作为结构先验来理解自然流的本质。

Method: 将智能体建模为与感官流耦合的通用神经动力学系统，分析世界跟踪施加的结构约束（构成方程和读出的等变性）和动力学约束（对称性诱导的守恒量和低维不变流形）。

Result: 证明了对称性导致智能体动力学中的守恒量（诺特风格标签），并将轨迹限制在低维不变流形上，这些流形与李伪群的组合分解对齐，为深度模型中的组合性优势提供几何解释。

Conclusion: 提出了一个基于对称性的预测编码版本，其中高层仅接收沿对称方向的粗粒度残差变换（预测误差坐标），这些对称方向在低层未解析。

Abstract: In the algorithmic (Kolmogorov) view, agents are programs that track and
compress sensory streams using generative programs. We propose a framework
where the relevant structural prior is simplicity (Solomonoff) understood as
\emph{compositional symmetry}: natural streams are well described by (local)
actions of finite-parameter Lie pseudogroups on geometrically and topologically
complex low-dimensional configuration manifolds (latent spaces). Modeling the
agent as a generic neural dynamical system coupled to such streams, we show
that accurate world-tracking imposes (i) \emph{structural constraints} --
equivariance of the agent's constitutive equations and readouts -- and (ii)
\emph{dynamical constraints}: under static inputs, symmetry induces conserved
quantities (Noether-style labels) in the agent dynamics and confines
trajectories to reduced invariant manifolds; under slow drift, these manifolds
move but remain low-dimensional. This yields a hierarchy of reduced manifolds
aligned with the compositional factorization of the pseudogroup, providing a
geometric account of the ``blessing of compositionality'' in deep models. We
connect these ideas to the Spencer formalism for Lie pseudogroups and formulate
a symmetry-based, self-contained version of predictive coding in which higher
layers receive only \emph{coarse-grained residual transformations}
(prediction-error coordinates) along symmetry directions unresolved at lower
layers.

Motivation: 脑机接口面临数据稀缺和主体间显著变异性的挑战，这限制了EEG解码模型在实际应用中的泛化能力和适用性。

Method: 通过解耦表示学习和特征融合，整合跨试验的特征，结合轻量级特征提取和重建流程，确保在有限数据约束下的数据多样性和可训练性。

Result: 在多个公开EEG数据集上的广泛实验表明，FusionGen显著优于现有的增强技术，在分类准确性上取得了显著提升。

Conclusion: FusionGen框架有效解决了EEG数据稀缺和主体间变异性的问题，为脑机接口的实际应用提供了更可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) provide potential for applications ranging
from medical rehabilitation to cognitive state assessment by establishing
direct communication pathways between the brain and external devices via
electroencephalography (EEG). However, EEG-based BCIs are severely constrained
by data scarcity and significant inter-subject variability, which hinder the
generalization and applicability of EEG decoding models in practical settings.
To address these challenges, we propose FusionGen, a novel EEG data generation
framework based on disentangled representation learning and feature fusion. By
integrating features across trials through a feature matching fusion module and
combining them with a lightweight feature extraction and reconstruction
pipeline, FusionGen ensures both data diversity and trainability under limited
data constraints. Extensive experiments on multiple publicly available EEG
datasets demonstrate that FusionGen significantly outperforms existing
augmentation techniques, yielding notable improvements in classification
accuracy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 构建学习模型时经常需要评估大量中间模型，但真实性能只有在评估后才知道，如何在有限预算下最优地探索中间模型空间是一个挑战

Method: 将问题形式化为Lipschitz空间中未知值函数的一般预算分配问题

Result: 

Conclusion: 

Abstract: Building learning models frequently requires evaluating numerous intermediate
models. Examples include models considered during feature selection, model
structure search, and parameter tunings. The evaluation of an intermediate
model influences subsequent model exploration decisions. Although prior
knowledge can provide initial quality estimates, true performance is only
revealed after evaluation. In this work, we address the challenge of optimally
allocating a bounded budget to explore the space of intermediate models. We
formalize this as a general budget allocation problem over unknown-value
functions within a Lipschitz space.

Conclusion: EDGAN在预测准确性和收敛稳定性方面持续优于传统GAN变体，为金融时间序列预测提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Forecasting stock prices remains challenging due to the volatile and
non-linear nature of financial markets. Despite the promise of deep learning,
issues such as mode collapse, unstable training, and difficulty in capturing
temporal and feature level correlations have limited the applications of GANs
in this domain. We propose a GRU-based Encoder-Decoder GAN (EDGAN) model that
strikes a balance between expressive power and simplicity. The model introduces
key innovations such as a temporal decoder with residual connections for
precise reconstruction, conditioning on static and dynamic covariates for
contextual learning, and a windowing mechanism to capture temporal dynamics.
Here, the generator uses a dense encoder-decoder framework with residual GRU
blocks. Extensive experiments on diverse stock datasets demonstrate that EDGAN
achieves superior forecasting accuracy and training stability, even in volatile
markets. It consistently outperforms traditional GAN variants in forecasting
accuracy and convergence stability under market conditions.

Conclusion: SDG-L框架能够有效利用电池状态数据准确预测容量衰减，为锂离子电池储能系统的可靠运行提供了重要技术支持。

Abstract: Lithium-ion batteries are becoming increasingly omnipresent in energy supply.
However, the durability of energy storage using lithium-ion batteries is
threatened by their dropping capacity with the growing number of
charging/discharging cycles. An accurate capacity prediction is the key to
ensure system efficiency and reliability, where the exploitation of battery
state information in each cycle has been largely undervalued. In this paper, we
propose a semiparametric deep Gaussian process regression framework named SDG-L
to give predictions based on the modeling of time series battery state data. By
introducing an LSTM feature extractor, the SDG-L is specially designed to
better utilize the auxiliary profiling information during charging/discharging
process. In experimental studies based on NASA dataset, our proposed method
obtains an average test MSE error of 1.2%. We also show that SDG-L achieves
better performance compared to existing works and validate the framework using
ablation studies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有黑盒成员推理攻击依赖不现实的假设：攻击者知道训练超参数、非训练样本与训练数据同分布、评估集中训练数据比例已知。移除这些假设会导致性能显著下降。

Method: 基于最大间隔隐式偏置理论，利用KKT最优性条件识别训练样本，通过找到梯度最能重构模型参数的样本来实现攻击。

Result: ImpMIA在仅有权重和训练数据超集的现实设置中，相比黑盒和白盒攻击都达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: ImpMIA证明了利用隐式偏置进行成员推理攻击的有效性，为现实场景中的隐私保护提供了重要见解。

Abstract: Determining which data samples were used to train a model-known as Membership
Inference Attack (MIA)-is a well-studied and important problem with
implications for data privacy. Black-box methods presume access only to the
model's outputs and often rely on training auxiliary reference models. While
they have shown strong empirical performance, they rely on assumptions that
rarely hold in real-world settings: (i) the attacker knows the training
hyperparameters; (ii) all available non-training samples come from the same
distribution as the training data; and (iii) the fraction of training data in
the evaluation set is known. In this paper, we demonstrate that removing these
assumptions leads to a significant drop in the performance of black-box
attacks. We introduce ImpMIA, a Membership Inference Attack that exploits the
Implicit Bias of neural networks, hence removes the need to rely on any
reference models and their assumptions. ImpMIA is a white-box attack -- a
setting which assumes access to model weights and is becoming increasingly
realistic given that many models are publicly available (e.g., via Hugging
Face). Building on maximum-margin implicit bias theory, ImpMIA uses the
Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) optimality conditions to identify training samples.
This is done by finding the samples whose gradients most strongly reconstruct
the trained model's parameters. As a result, ImpMIA achieves state-of-the-art
performance compared to both black and white box attacks in realistic settings
where only the model weights and a superset of the training data are available.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前蛋白质结构表示方法面临SE(3)流形复杂性、离散标记化或需要多个训练目标等问题，这些都会阻碍模型优化和泛化能力。

Method: 使用非等变扩散变换器，采用瓶颈设计进行高效压缩，通过单一流匹配目标进行端到端训练。

Conclusion: ProteinAE通过简化的优化流程，在蛋白质结构表示和生成方面表现出色，显著优于先前的潜空间方法。

Abstract: Developing effective representations of protein structures is essential for
advancing protein science, particularly for protein generative modeling.
Current approaches often grapple with the complexities of the SE(3) manifold,
rely on discrete tokenization, or the need for multiple training objectives,
all of which can hinder the model optimization and generalization. We introduce
ProteinAE, a novel and streamlined protein diffusion autoencoder designed to
overcome these challenges by directly mapping protein backbone coordinates from
E(3) into a continuous, compact latent space. ProteinAE employs a
non-equivariant Diffusion Transformer with a bottleneck design for efficient
compression and is trained end-to-end with a single flow matching objective,
substantially simplifying the optimization pipeline. We demonstrate that
ProteinAE achieves state-of-the-art reconstruction quality, outperforming
existing autoencoders. The resulting latent space serves as a powerful

Abstract: Retrosynthesis is one of the domains transformed by the rise of generative
models, and it is one where the problem of nonsensical or erroneous outputs
(hallucinations) is particularly insidious: reliable assessment of synthetic
plans is time-consuming, with automatic methods lacking. In this work, we
present RetroTrim, a retrosynthesis system that successfully avoids nonsensical
plans on a set of challenging drug-like targets. Compared to common baselines
in the field, our system is not only the sole method that succeeds in filtering
out hallucinated reactions, but it also results in the highest number of
high-quality paths overall. The key insight behind RetroTrim is the combination
of diverse reaction scoring strategies, based on machine learning models and
existing chemical databases. We show that our scoring strategies capture
different classes of hallucinations by analyzing them on a dataset of labeled
retrosynthetic intermediates. To measure the performance of retrosynthesis
systems, we propose a novel evaluation protocol for reactions and synthetic
paths based on a structured review by expert chemists. Using this protocol, we
compare systems on a set of 32 novel targets, curated to reflect recent trends
in drug structures. While the insights behind our methodology are broadly
applicable to retrosynthesis, our focus is on targets in the drug-like domain.
By releasing our benchmark targets and the details of our evaluation protocol,
we hope to inspire further research into reliable retrosynthesis.

Abstract: Control Co-Design (CCD) integrates physical and control system design to
improve the performance of dynamic and autonomous systems. Despite advances in
uncertainty-aware CCD methods, real-world uncertainties remain highly
unpredictable. Multi-generation design addresses this challenge by considering
the full lifecycle of a product: data collected from each generation informs
the design of subsequent generations, enabling progressive improvements in
robustness and efficiency. Digital Twin (DT) technology further strengthens
this paradigm by creating virtual representations that evolve over the
lifecycle through real-time sensing, model updating, and adaptive
re-optimization. This paper presents a DT-enabled CCD framework that integrates
Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) to jointly optimize physical design and
controller. DRL accelerates real-time decision-making by allowing controllers
to continuously learn from data and adapt to uncertain environments. Extending
this approach, the framework employs a multi-generation paradigm, where each
cycle of deployment, operation, and redesign uses collected data to refine DT
models, improve uncertainty quantification through quantile regression, and
inform next-generation designs of both physical components and controllers. The
framework is demonstrated on an active suspension system, where DT-enabled
learning from road conditions and driving behaviors yields smoother and more
stable control trajectories. Results show that the method significantly
enhances dynamic performance, robustness, and efficiency. Contributions of this
work include: (1) extending CCD into a lifecycle-oriented multi-generation
framework, (2) leveraging DTs for continuous model updating and informed
design, and (3) employing DRL to accelerate adaptive real-time decision-making.

Abstract: Accurate modeling of inter-stock relationships is critical for stock price
forecasting. However, existing methods predominantly focus on single-state
relationships, neglecting the essential complementarity between dynamic and
static inter-stock relations. To solve this problem, we propose a Dual Relation
Fusion Network (DRFN) to capture the long-term relative stability of stock
relation structures while retaining the flexibility to respond to sudden market
shifts. Our approach features a novel relative static relation component that
models time-varying long-term patterns and incorporates overnight informational
influences. We capture dynamic inter-stock relationships through distance-aware
mechanisms, while evolving long-term structures via recurrent fusion of dynamic
relations from the prior day with the pre-defined static relations. Experiments
demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms the baselines across
different markets, with high sensitivity to the co-movement of relational
strength and stock price.

Abstract: Accurate climate forecasting is vital for Bangladesh, a region highly
susceptible to climate change impacts on temperature and rainfall. Existing
models often struggle to capture long-range dependencies and complex temporal
patterns in climate data. This study introduces an advanced Long Short-Term
Memory (LSTM) model integrated with an attention mechanism to enhance the
prediction of temperature and rainfall dynamics. Utilizing comprehensive
datasets from 1901-2023, sourced from NASA's POWER Project for temperature and
the Humanitarian Data Exchange for rainfall, the model effectively captures
seasonal and long-term trends. It outperforms baseline models, including
XGBoost, Simple LSTM, and GRU, achieving a test MSE of 0.2411 (normalized
units), MAE of 0.3860 degrees C, R^2 of 0.9834, and NRMSE of 0.0370 for
temperature, and MSE of 1283.67 mm^2, MAE of 22.91 mm, R^2 of 0.9639, and NRMSE
of 0.0354 for rainfall on monthly forecasts. The model demonstrates improved
robustness with only a 20 percent increase in MSE under simulated climate
trends (compared to an approximately 2.2-fold increase in baseline models
without trend features) and a 50 percent degradation under regional variations
(compared to an approximately 4.8-fold increase in baseline models without
enhancements). These results highlight the model's ability to improve
forecasting precision and offer potential insights into the physical processes
governing climate variability in Bangladesh, supporting applications in
climate-sensitive sectors.

Abstract: The generation of trees with a specified tree edit distance has significant
applications across various fields, including computational biology, structured
data analysis, and image processing. Recently, generative networks have been
increasingly employed to synthesize new data that closely resembles the
original datasets. However, the appropriate size and depth of generative
networks required to generate data with a specified tree edit distance remain
unclear. In this paper, we theoretically establish the existence and
construction of generative networks capable of producing trees similar to a
given tree with respect to the tree edit distance. Specifically, for a given
rooted, ordered, and vertex-labeled tree T of size n + 1 with labels from an
alphabet \Sigma, and a non-negative integer d, we prove that all rooted,
ordered, and vertex-labeled trees over \Sigma with tree edit distance at most d
from T can be generated using a ReLU-based generative network with size O(n^3 )
and constant depth. The proposed networks were implemented and evaluated for
generating trees with up to 21 nodes. Due to their deterministic architecture,
the networks successfully generated all valid trees within the specified tree
edit distance. In contrast, state-of-the-art graph generative models GraphRNN
and GraphGDP, which rely on non-deterministic mechanisms, produced
significantly fewer valid trees, achieving validation rates of only up to 35%
and 48%, respectively. These findings provide a theoretical foundation towards
construction of compact generative models and open new directions for exact and
valid tree-structured data generation. An implementation of the proposed
networks is available at https://github.com/MGANN-KU/TreeGen_ReLUNetworks.

Motivation: 为非线性上下文赌博机问题提供一个统一的集成采样算法框架，解决现有方法在非线性模型中的挑战，并开发适用于未知时间范围的算法。

Method: 通过最大似然估计在随机扰动数据上维护多个奖励模型参数估计器，开发了GLM-ES和Neural-ES两种集成采样方法。

Result: 证明了GLM-ES的遗憾界为O(d³/²√T + d⁹/²)，Neural-ES的遗憾界为O(˜d√T)，与最先进的随机探索算法相匹配，并通过实验验证了算法的实际性能。

Conclusion: 集成采样被证明是非线性上下文赌博机中一种可证明且实用的随机探索方法，并开发了适用于未知时间范围的随时版本算法。

Abstract: We provide a unified algorithmic framework for ensemble sampling in nonlinear
contextual bandits and develop corresponding regret bounds for two most common
nonlinear contextual bandit settings: Generalized Linear Ensemble Sampling
(\texttt{GLM-ES}) for generalized linear bandits and Neural Ensemble Sampling
(\texttt{Neural-ES}) for neural contextual bandits. Both methods maintain
multiple estimators for the reward model parameters via maximum likelihood
estimation on randomly perturbed data. We prove high-probability frequentist
regret bounds of $\mathcal{O}(d^{3/2} \sqrt{T} + d^{9/2})$ for \texttt{GLM-ES}
and $\mathcal{O}(\widetilde{d} \sqrt{T})$ for \texttt{Neural-ES}, where $d$ is
the dimension of feature vectors, $\widetilde{d}$ is the effective dimension of
a neural tangent kernel matrix, and $T$ is the number of rounds. These regret
bounds match the state-of-the-art results of randomized exploration algorithms
in nonlinear contextual bandit settings. In the theoretical analysis, we
introduce techniques that address challenges specific to nonlinear models.
Practically, we remove fixed-time horizon assumptions by developing anytime
versions of our algorithms, suitable when $T$ is unknown. Finally, we
empirically evaluate \texttt{GLM-ES}, \texttt{Neural-ES}, and their anytime
variants, demonstrating strong performance. Overall, our results establish
ensemble sampling as a provable and practical randomized exploration approach
for nonlinear contextual bandits.

TL;DR: 提出了优化深度网络（ODNs），通过渐进深度扩展训练策略，根据数据集复杂度自动确定最优网络深度，减少冗余层，显著降低内存占用和计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度神经网络通常以全深度训练，但并非所有数据集都需要如此高的模型容量，导致计算浪费、能耗过高和内存占用过大，难以在资源受限设备上部署。

Method: 采用类似神经架构搜索的训练策略——渐进深度扩展，从较浅深度开始训练，随着早期模块收敛逐步增加深度，直到达到目标精度，仅保留数据集所需的最优深度。

Result: 在MNIST和SVHN数据集上，ResNet-18和ResNet-34的最优深度分别实现了98.64%和96.44%的内存占用减少，同时保持了99.31%和96.08%的竞争性准确率。

Conclusion: ODNs能够在保持准确性的同时，显著降低模型的内存占用和计算需求，使深度神经网络更易于在边缘设备上部署。

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) have provided brilliant performance across
various tasks. However, this success often comes at the cost of unnecessarily
large model sizes, high computational demands, and substantial memory
footprints. Typically, powerful architectures are trained at full depths but
not all datasets or tasks require such high model capacity. Training very deep
architectures on relatively low-complexity datasets frequently leads to wasted
computation, unnecessary energy consumption, and excessive memory usage, which
in turn makes deployment of models on resource-constrained devices impractical.
To address this problem, we introduce Optimally Deep Networks (ODNs), which
provide a balance between model depth and task complexity. Specifically, we
propose a NAS like training strategy called progressive depth expansion, which
begins by training deep networks at shallower depths and incrementally
increases their depth as the earlier blocks converge, continuing this process
until the target accuracy is reached. ODNs use only the optimal depth for the
given datasets, removing redundant layers. This cuts down future training and
inference costs, lowers the memory footprint, enhances computational
efficiency, and facilitates deployment on edge devices. Empirical results show
that the optimal depths of ResNet-18 and ResNet-34 for MNIST and SVHN, achieve
up to 98.64 % and 96.44 % reduction in memory footprint, while maintaining a
competitive accuracy of 99.31 % and 96.08 %, respectively.

TL;DR: 本文分析了RLHF微调扩散模型时训练与推理阶段采样器不匹配导致的奖励差距问题，提供了理论分析和实证验证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RLHF微调扩散模型时，训练使用随机SDE采样器以鼓励探索，而推理使用确定性ODE采样器以提高效率和稳定性，这种不匹配会导致奖励差距，影响推理时输出质量。

Method: 采用广义去噪扩散隐式模型(gDDIM)框架支持任意高水平的随机性，保持数据边际分布；通过理论分析推导奖励差距的边界，并对VE和VP高斯模型提供更尖锐的收敛率。

Result: 大规模文本到图像模型实验验证，使用DDPO和MixGRPO方法时，奖励差距在训练过程中持续缩小，当使用更高随机性的SDE训练更新模型时，ODE采样质量得到改善。

Conclusion: 训练与推理采样器不匹配导致的奖励差距问题可以通过理论分析和适当的训练策略得到缓解，高随机性SDE训练有助于提升推理时ODE采样的质量。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) is increasingly used to
fine-tune diffusion models, but a key challenge arises from the mismatch
between stochastic samplers used during training and deterministic samplers
used during inference. In practice, models are fine-tuned using stochastic SDE
samplers to encourage exploration, while inference typically relies on
deterministic ODE samplers for efficiency and stability. This discrepancy
induces a reward gap, raising concerns about whether high-quality outputs can
be expected during inference. In this paper, we theoretically characterize this
reward gap and provide non-vacuous bounds for general diffusion models, along
with sharper convergence rates for Variance Exploding (VE) and Variance
Preserving (VP) Gaussian models. Methodologically, we adopt the generalized
denoising diffusion implicit models (gDDIM) framework to support arbitrarily
high levels of stochasticity, preserving data marginals throughout.
Empirically, our findings through large-scale experiments on text-to-image
models using denoising diffusion policy optimization (DDPO) and mixed group
relative policy optimization (MixGRPO) validate that reward gaps consistently
narrow over training, and ODE sampling quality improves when models are updated
using higher-stochasticity SDE training.

Conclusion: OmniGNN通过创新的行业节点设计和多关系建模，有效提升了金融图神经网络在宏观经济冲击下的预测性能和鲁棒性。

Abstract: In financial markets, Graph Neural Networks have been successfully applied to
modeling relational data, effectively capturing nonlinear inter-stock
dependencies. Yet, existing models often fail to efficiently propagate messages
during macroeconomic shocks. In this paper, we propose OmniGNN, an
attention-based multi-relational dynamic GNN that integrates macroeconomic
context via heterogeneous node and edge types for robust message passing.
Central to OmniGNN is a sector node acting as a global intermediary, enabling
rapid shock propagation across the graph without relying on long-range
multi-hop diffusion. The model leverages Graph Attention Networks (GAT) to
weigh neighbor contributions and employs Transformers to capture temporal
dynamics across multiplex relations. Experiments show that OmniGNN outperforms
existing stock prediction models on public datasets, particularly demonstrating
strong robustness during the COVID-19 period.

Conclusion: 该工作提供了一个统一的优化框架，揭示了不同优化器之间的内在联系，并提出了具有竞争力的新方法。

Abstract: Optimization lies at the core of modern deep learning, yet existing methods
often face a fundamental trade-off between adapting to problem geometry and
leveraging curvature utilization. Steepest descent algorithms adapt to
different geometries through norm choices but remain strictly first-order,
whereas quasi-Newton and adaptive optimizers incorporate curvature information
but are restricted to Frobenius geometry, limiting their applicability across
diverse architectures. In this work, we propose a unified framework
generalizing steepest descent, quasi-Newton methods, and adaptive methods
through the novel notion of preconditioned matrix norms. This abstraction
reveals that widely used optimizers such as SGD and Adam, as well as more
advanced approaches like Muon and KL-Shampoo, and recent hybrids including SOAP
and SPlus, all emerge as special cases of the same principle. Within this
framework, we provide the first systematic treatment of affine and scale
invariance in the matrix-parameterized setting, establishing necessary and
sufficient conditions under generalized norms. Building on this foundation, we
introduce two new methods, $\texttt{MuAdam}$ and $\texttt{MuAdam-SANIA}$, which
combine the spectral geometry of Muon with Adam-style preconditioning. Our
experiments demonstrate that these optimizers are competitive with, and in some
cases outperform, existing state-of-the-art methods. Our code is available at

Abstract: Today's deep learning architectures are primarily based on perceptron models,
which do not capture the oscillatory dynamics characteristic of biological
neurons. Although oscillatory systems have recently gained attention for their
closer resemblance to neural behavior, they still fall short of modeling the
intricate spatio-temporal interactions observed in natural neural circuits. In
this paper, we propose a bio-inspired oscillatory state system (BioOSS)
designed to emulate the wave-like propagation dynamics critical to neural
processing, particularly in the prefrontal cortex (PFC), where complex activity
patterns emerge. BioOSS comprises two interacting populations of neurons: p
neurons, which represent simplified membrane-potential-like units inspired by
pyramidal cells in cortical columns, and o neurons, which govern propagation
velocities and modulate the lateral spread of activity. Through local
interactions, these neurons produce wave-like propagation patterns. The model
incorporates trainable parameters for damping and propagation speed, enabling
flexible adaptation to task-specific spatio-temporal structures. We evaluate
BioOSS on both synthetic and real-world tasks, demonstrating superior
performance and enhanced interpretability compared to alternative
architectures.

Abstract: Recent advances in machine learning such as Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)
models and Transformers have been widely adopted in hydrological applications,
demonstrating impressive performance amongst deep learning models and
outperforming physical models in various tasks. However, their superiority in
predicting land surface states such as terrestrial water storage (TWS) that are
dominated by many factors such as natural variability and human driven
modifications remains unclear. Here, using the open-access, globally
representative HydroGlobe dataset - comprising a baseline version derived
solely from a land surface model simulation and an advanced version
incorporating multi-source remote sensing data assimilation - we show that
linear regression is a robust benchmark, outperforming the more complex LSTM
and Temporal Fusion Transformer for TWS prediction. Our findings highlight the
importance of including traditional statistical models as benchmarks when
developing and evaluating deep learning models. Additionally, we emphasize the
critical need to establish globally representative benchmark datasets that
capture the combined impact of natural variability and human interventions.

Conclusion: 剪枝作为开发简化时空问题模型的有效工具，能够识别问题中最重要的元素，具有重要应用潜力。

Abstract: This work addresses the challenge of using a deep learning model to prune
graphs and the ability of this method to integrate explainability into
spatio-temporal problems through a new approach. Instead of applying
explainability to the model's behavior, we seek to gain a better understanding
of the problem itself. To this end, we propose a novel model that integrates an
optimized pruning mechanism capable of removing nodes from the graph during the
training process, rather than doing so as a separate procedure. This
integration allows the architecture to learn how to minimize prediction error
while selecting the most relevant nodes. Thus, during training, the model
searches for the most relevant subset of nodes, obtaining the most important
elements of the problem, facilitating its analysis. To evaluate the proposed
approach, we used several widely used traffic datasets, comparing the accuracy
obtained by pruning with the model and with other methods. The experiments
demonstrate that our method is capable of retaining a greater amount of
information as the graph reduces in size compared to the other methods used.
These results highlight the potential of pruning as a tool for developing
models capable of simplifying spatio-temporal problems, thereby obtaining their
most important elements.

*Ali Atiah Alzahrani*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文提出了MARCD方法，通过结合制度条件生成场景和CVaR分配器来改善制度转换下的投资组合决策，在严格的前向测试中显著提升了夏普比率并降低了最大回撤。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究制度条件生成场景与凸CVaR分配器结合是否能改善制度转换下的投资组合决策，特别关注尾部风险控制和回撤管理。

Method: 引入MARCD方法：1) 通过高斯HMM推断潜在制度；2) 使用尾部加权目标和制度专业化MoE去噪器训练扩散模型以丰富危机联动；3) 将生成场景输入考虑换手率的CVaR对偶二次规划。

Result: 在2005-2025年流动性多资产ETF的严格前向测试中，MARCD优于标准分配器，2020-2025年样本外测试显示夏普比率1.23（基准1.02），最大回撤9.3%（基准14.1%），回撤降低34%，夏普提升在5%水平显著。

Conclusion: MARCD提供了一个从尾部忠实场景建模到受治理投资组合决策的可复现桥梁，显著改善了回撤控制，并提供了理论保证。

Abstract: We study whether regime-conditioned generative scenarios, coupled with a
convex CVaR allocator, improve portfolio decisions under regime shifts. We
introduce Multi-Agent Regime-Conditioned Diffusion (MARCD), which (i) infers
latent regimes via a Gaussian HMM, (ii) trains a diffusion model with a
tail-weighted objective and a regime-specialized mixture-of-experts (MoE)
denoiser to enrich crisis co-movements, and (iii) feeds the generated scenarios
into a turnover-aware CVaR epigraph quadratic program with explicit governance.
In strict walk-forward tests on liquid multi-asset ETFs (2005-2025), MARCD
outperforms standard allocators and improves calibration relative to popular
generators. Over 2020-2025 out-of-sample (monthly; 10 bps), MARCD attains
Sharpe 1.23 (BL 1.02) and MaxDD 9.3 percent (BL 14.1 percent), a 34 percent
reduction, at comparable turnover; stationary block-bootstrap intervals
indicate the Sharpe uplift is significant at 5 percent. We provide theory
linking tail-weighted diffusion to spectral-risk control of the
decision-relevant CVaR gap, oracle/consistency results for the regime-MoE
denoiser, and Lipschitz/regret guarantees for the allocator. Together, MARCD
offers a reproducible bridge from tail-faithful scenario modeling to governed
portfolio decisions with materially improved drawdown control.

TL;DR: AEGIS是一个中间件框架，用于为包含特征和类别标签的机器学习数据集识别最优的掩码配置，通过最小化预测效用偏差来最大化数据集效用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于隐私问题，数据提供者通常在共享数据前进行匿名化处理，但不同的掩码配置会产生不同效用的数据集，因此需要高效确定最优掩码配置。

Method: 提出基于迭代比例拟合的联合分布估计器，利用有限数据摘要或无数据来估计特征-标签联合分布，支持多种特征-标签相关性量化方法。

Result: 在真实数据集上的实验表明，AEGIS识别最优掩码配置的速度比基线方法快一个数量级，同时生成的掩码数据集在下游ML任务中达到与基线相当的预测性能。

Conclusion: AEGIS框架在保护隐私的同时，能够高效识别最优掩码配置，为数据共享生态系统提供实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Data-sharing ecosystems enable entities -- such as providers, consumers, and
intermediaries -- to access, exchange, and utilize data for various downstream
tasks and applications. Due to privacy concerns, data providers typically
anonymize datasets before sharing them; however, the existence of multiple
masking configurations results in masked datasets with varying utility.
Consequently, a key challenge lies in efficiently determining the optimal
masking configuration that maximizes a dataset's utility. This paper presents
AEGIS, a middleware framework for identifying the optimal masking configuration
for machine learning datasets that consist of features and a class label. We
introduce a utility optimizer that minimizes predictive utility deviation -- a
metric based on the changes in feature-label correlations before and after
masking. Our framework leverages limited data summaries (such as 1D histograms)
or none to estimate the feature-label joint distribution, making it suitable
for scenarios where raw data is inaccessible due to privacy restrictions. To
achieve this, we propose a joint distribution estimator based on iterative
proportional fitting, which allows supporting various feature-label correlation
quantification methods such as g3, mutual information, or chi-square. Our
experimental evaluation on real-world datasets shows that AEGIS identifies
optimal masking configurations over an order of magnitude faster, while the
resulting masked datasets achieve predictive performance on downstream ML tasks
that is on par with baseline approaches.

TL;DR: 提出GLANCE框架，通过轻量级路由器选择性调用LLM来优化GNN预测，在异构节点上实现显著性能提升，同时保持整体性能最佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM-GNN融合策略对所有节点统一应用，性能提升有限。研究发现GNN和LLM在不同结构模式上表现各异，需要针对GNN易出错节点进行选择性融合。

Method: GLANCE框架包含轻量级路由器，基于低成本节点信号决定是否查询LLM。路由器使用基于优势的目标函数训练，比较调用LLM与仅依赖GNN的效用。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，GLANCE在节点子组间实现最佳性能平衡，异构节点性能提升高达13%，同时达到顶级整体性能。

Conclusion: 自适应、节点感知的GNN-LLM架构具有重要价值，选择性调用LLM可在不增加高计算成本的情况下实现大规模图上的可扩展部署。

Abstract: Learning on text-attributed graphs has motivated the use of Large Language
Models (LLMs) for graph learning. However, most fusion strategies are applied
uniformly across all nodes and attain only small overall performance gains. We
argue this result stems from aggregate metrics that obscure when LLMs provide
benefit, inhibiting actionable signals for new strategies. In this work, we
reframe LLM-GNN fusion around nodes where GNNs typically falter. We first show
that performance can significantly differ between GNNs and LLMs, with each
excelling on distinct structural patterns, such as local homophily. To leverage
this finding, we propose GLANCE (GNN with LLM Assistance for Neighbor- and
Context-aware Embeddings), a framework that invokes an LLM to refine a GNN's
prediction. GLANCE employs a lightweight router that, given inexpensive
per-node signals, decides whether to query the LLM. Since the LLM calls are
non-differentiable, the router is trained with an advantage-based objective
that compares the utility of querying the LLM against relying solely on the
GNN. Across multiple benchmarks, GLANCE achieves the best performance balance
across node subgroups, achieving significant gains on heterophilous nodes (up
to $+13\%$) while simultaneously achieving top overall performance. Our
findings highlight the value of adaptive, node-aware GNN-LLM architectures,
where selectively invoking the LLM enables scalable deployment on large graphs
without incurring high computational costs.

Motivation: 连续状态扩散模型已有充分研究，但离散状态扩散模型（用于文本、序列和组合结构）的理论理解严重不足，现有分析都假设分数估计误差界限而没有研究样本复杂度。

Method: 提出了一个原则性的理论框架，将分数估计误差分解为统计、近似、优化和裁剪四个组成部分，系统分析离散状态扩散模型。

Abstract: Diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable performance in generating
high-dimensional samples across domains such as vision, language, and the
sciences. Although continuous-state diffusion models have been extensively
studied both empirically and theoretically, discrete-state diffusion models,
essential for applications involving text, sequences, and combinatorial
structures, remain significantly less understood from a theoretical standpoint.
In particular, all existing analyses of discrete-state models assume score
estimation error bounds without studying sample complexity results. In this
work, we present a principled theoretical framework for discrete-state
diffusion, providing the first sample complexity bound of
$\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(\epsilon^{-2})$. Our structured decomposition of the
score estimation error into statistical, approximation, optimization, and
clipping components offers critical insights into how discrete-state models can
be trained efficiently. This analysis addresses a fundamental gap in the
literature and establishes the theoretical tractability and practical relevance
of discrete-state diffusion models.

Conclusion: 理论分析表明GNN的平均频率响应与图异配性程度之间不存在严格单调相关性，需要自适应图滤波器来保证良好的泛化性能，提出的自适应滤波方法在实验中表现出色。

Abstract: Graph heterophily, where connected nodes have different labels, has attracted
significant interest recently. Most existing works adopt a simplified approach
- using low-pass filters for homophilic graphs and high-pass filters for
heterophilic graphs. However, we discover that the relationship between graph
heterophily and spectral filters is more complex - the optimal filter response
varies across frequency components and does not follow a strict monotonic
correlation with heterophily degree. This finding challenges conventional fixed
filter designs and suggests the need for adaptive filtering to preserve
expressiveness in graph embeddings. Formally, natural questions arise: Given a
heterophilic graph G, how and to what extent will the varying heterophily
degree of G affect the performance of GNNs? How can we design adaptive filters
to fit those varying heterophilic connections? Our theoretical analysis reveals
that the average frequency response of GNNs and graph heterophily degree do not
follow a strict monotonic correlation, necessitating adaptive graph filters to
guarantee good generalization performance. Hence, we propose [METHOD NAME], a
simple yet powerful GNN, which extracts information across the heterophily
spectrum and combines salient representations through adaptive mixing. [METHOD
NAME]'s superior performance achieves up to 9.2% accuracy improvement over
leading baselines across homophilic and heterophilic graphs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 发布机器学习模型时披露私人信息是一个常见担忧，虽然直觉上发布模型比发布数据集风险更小，但需要量化评估实际风险程度。

Method: 基于信息泄露上界推导出梯度唯一性这一原则性披露度量方法，并设计了一种基于监控梯度唯一性的简单防御机制。

Result: 该方法在隐私保护方面与经典方法DP-SGD相当，但在测试准确率等效用指标上表现更优。

Conclusion: 梯度唯一性提供了一种直观的隐私审计方式，其数学推导具有普适性，不依赖特定假设，且相关防御机制在隐私和效用之间取得了良好平衡。

Abstract: Disclosing private information via publication of a machine learning model is
often a concern. Intuitively, publishing a learned model should be less risky
than publishing a dataset. But how much risk is there? In this paper, we
present a principled disclosure metric called \emph{gradient uniqueness} that
is derived from an upper bound on the amount of information disclosure from
publishing a learned model. Gradient uniqueness provides an intuitive way to
perform privacy auditing. The mathematical derivation of gradient uniqueness is
general, and does not make any assumption on the model architecture, dataset
type, or the strategy of an attacker. We examine a simple defense based on
monitoring gradient uniqueness, and find that it achieves privacy comparable to
classical methods such as DP-SGD, while being substantially better in terms of
(utility) testing accuracy.

Motivation: 现有基于VAE的时间序列异常检测方法存在单窗口特征限制，且未能充分利用长期时间和频率信息，导致检测性能受限。

Method: 提出LPCVAE模型：1）引入LSTM捕获窗口外的长期依赖关系；2）采用Product-of-Experts机制进行自适应分布级概率融合，减少时频信息损失。

Result: 在四个公共数据集上的大量实验表明，该方法优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: 将长期时间和频率表示与自适应融合相结合，为时间序列异常检测提供了鲁棒且高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Time series anomaly detection(TSAD) is a critical task in signal processing
field, ensuring the reliability of complex systems. Reconstruction-based
methods dominate in TSAD. Among these methods, VAE-based methods have achieved
promising results. Existing VAE-based methods suffer from the limitation of
single-window feature and insufficient leveraging of long-term time and
frequency information. We propose a Conditional Variational AutoEncoder with
Long-term dependency and Probabilistic time-frequency fusion, named LPCVAE.
LPCVAE introduces LSTM to capture long-term dependencies beyond windows. It
further incorporates a Product-of-Experts (PoE) mechanism for adaptive and
distribution-level probabilistic fusion. This design effectively mitigates
time-frequency information loss. Extensive experiments on four public datasets
demonstrate it outperforms state-of-the-art methods. The results confirm that
integrating long-term time and frequency representations with adaptive fusion
yields a robust and efficient solution for TSAD.

Motivation: 现有研究表明，更强的模型并不总是最优的教师，存在教师输出与学生可学习性不匹配的问题。

Method: PerSyn采用"路由后生成"范式：首先通过查询级路由器为每个提示分配最优教师，考虑学生可学习性和教师响应质量；然后每个教师只为其分配的提示生成数据。

Result: 在不同模型家族和规模上的广泛实验表明，PerSyn在指令调优和数学推理设置中始终优于或与所有基线方法相当。

Conclusion: PerSyn通过个性化数据合成策略有效解决了教师-学生不匹配问题，验证了其有效性并为未来研究提供了见解。

Abstract: Training student models on synthetic data generated by strong teacher models
is a promising way to distilling the capabilities of teachers. However, recent
studies show that stronger models are not always optimal teachers, revealing a
mismatch between teacher outputs and student learnability. To address this
issue, we propose PerSyn (Personalized data Synthesis), a novel synthesis
strategy that operates under a new ``Route then Generate'' paradigm to create
data tailored to each student model, enabling it to learn more effectively.
Specifically, PerSyn first assigns each prompt to its optimal teacher via a
query-level router that jointly considers student learnability and teacher
response quality. Each teacher then synthesizes data only for its assigned
prompts, making the process more efficient than the conventional ``Generate
then Select'' paradigm, where all teachers must generate parallel responses for
the entire prompt set before constructing the final dataset. Extensive
experiments across different model families and scales demonstrate that PerSyn
consistently achieves superior or comparable performance to all baselines in
instruct tuning and math reasoning settings. Further analysis verifies the
effectiveness of PerSyn and offers extra insights to propel future research.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has been an important machine learning paradigm
for solving long-horizon sequential decision-making problems under uncertainty.
By integrating deep neural networks (DNNs) into the RL framework, deep
reinforcement learning (DRL) has emerged, which achieved significant success in
various domains. However, the integration of DNNs also makes it vulnerable to
adversarial attacks. Existing adversarial attack techniques mainly focus on
either directly manipulating the environment with which a victim agent
interacts or deploying an adversarial agent that interacts with the victim
agent to induce abnormal behaviors. While these techniques achieve promising
results, their adoption in multi-party open systems remains limited due to two
major reasons: impractical assumption of full control over the environment and
dependent on interactions with victim agents.
  To enable adversarial attacks in multi-party open systems, in this paper, we
redesigned an adversarial policy learning approach that can mislead
well-trained victim agents without requiring direct interactions with these
agents or full control over their environments. Particularly, we propose a
neutral agent-based approach across various task scenarios in multi-party open
systems. While the neutral agents seemingly are detached from the victim
agents, indirectly influence them through the shared environment. We evaluate
our proposed method on the SMAC platform based on Starcraft II and the
autonomous driving simulation platform Highway-env. The experimental results
demonstrate that our method can launch general and effective adversarial
attacks in multi-party open systems.

Motivation: 将经典信息论扩展到有限和结构化系统，重新定义冗余为信息组织的基本属性，而非通信理论中的低效表现。

Conclusion: 冗余是可测量和可调的量，连接了通信的渐近世界和学习的有限世界，在有限结构化系统中冗余对稳定性和泛化至关重要。

Abstract: We present a theoretical framework that extends classical information theory
to finite and structured systems by redefining redundancy as a fundamental
property of information organization rather than inefficiency. In this
framework, redundancy is expressed as a general family of informational
divergences that unifies multiple classical measures, such as mutual
information, chi-squared dependence, and spectral redundancy, under a single
geometric principle. This reveals that these traditional quantities are not
isolated heuristics but projections of a shared redundancy geometry. The theory
further predicts that redundancy is bounded both above and below, giving rise
to an optimal equilibrium that balances over-compression (loss of structure)
and over-coupling (collapse). While classical communication theory favors
minimal redundancy for transmission efficiency, finite and structured systems,
such as those underlying real-world learning, achieve maximal stability and
generalization near this equilibrium. Experiments with masked autoencoders are
used to illustrate and verify this principle: the model exhibits a stable
redundancy level where generalization peaks. Together, these results establish
redundancy as a measurable and tunable quantity that bridges the asymptotic
world of communication and the finite world of learning.

Abstract: Early detection of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is crucial because its
neurodegenerative effects are irreversible, and neuropathologic and
social-behavioral risk factors accumulate years before diagnosis. Identifying
higher-risk individuals earlier enables prevention, timely care, and equitable
resource allocation. We predict cognitive performance from social determinants
of health (SDOH) using the NIH NIA-supported PREPARE Challenge Phase 2 dataset
derived from the nationally representative Mex-Cog cohort of the 2003 and 2012
Mexican Health and Aging Study (MHAS).
  Data: The target is a validated composite cognitive score across seven
domains-orientation, memory, attention, language, constructional praxis, and
executive function-derived from the 2016 and 2021 MHAS waves. Predictors span
demographic, socioeconomic, health, lifestyle, psychosocial, and healthcare
access factors.
  Methodology: Missingness was addressed with a singular value decomposition
(SVD)-based imputation pipeline treating continuous and categorical variables
separately. This approach leverages latent feature correlations to recover
missing values while balancing reliability and scalability. After evaluating
multiple methods, XGBoost was chosen for its superior predictive performance.
  Results and Discussion: The framework outperformed existing methods and the
data challenge leaderboard, demonstrating high accuracy, robustness, and
interpretability. SHAP-based post hoc analysis identified top contributing SDOH
factors and age-specific feature patterns. Notably, flooring material emerged
as a strong predictor, reflecting socioeconomic and environmental disparities.
Other influential factors, age, SES, lifestyle, social interaction, sleep,
stress, and BMI, underscore the multifactorial nature of cognitive aging and
the value of interpretable, data-driven SDOH modeling.

Result: 在多个数学推理基准测试中，AER持续优于基线方法，提高了推理准确性和探索能力。

Conclusion: 自适应熵正则化能有效解决RLVR中的策略熵崩溃问题，显著提升大语言模型的推理性能。

Abstract: Reasoning ability has become a defining capability of Large Language Models
(LLMs), with Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) emerging as
a key paradigm to enhance it. However, RLVR training often suffers from policy
entropy collapse, where the policy becomes overly deterministic, hindering
exploration and limiting reasoning performance. While entropy regularization is
a common remedy, its effectiveness is highly sensitive to the fixed
coefficient, making it unstable across tasks and models. In this work, we
revisit entropy regularization in RLVR and argue that its potential has been
largely underestimated. Our analysis shows that (i) tasks of varying difficulty
demand distinct exploration intensities, and (ii) balanced exploration may
require the policy entropy to be maintained within a moderate range below its
initial level. Therefore, we propose Adaptive Entropy Regularization (AER)--a
framework that dynamically balances exploration and exploitation via three
components: difficulty-aware coefficient allocation, initial-anchored target
entropy, and dynamic global coefficient adjustment. Experiments on multiple
mathematical reasoning benchmarks show that AER consistently outperforms
baselines, improving both reasoning accuracy and exploration capability.

TL;DR: MC#框架通过静态量化和动态专家剪枝相结合，对MoE模型进行激进压缩，在DeepSeek-VL2上实现6.2倍权重压缩和20%以上专家激活减少，性能损失极小。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MoE模型虽然通过稀疏激活扩展了模型容量，但预加载所有专家和激活多个专家带来了显著的计算和内存开销，专家模块成为模型大小和推理成本的主要贡献者。

Method: 提出MC#框架：1) PMQ预加载混合精度量化，通过线性规划优化比特分配；2) OTP在线Top-any剪枝，使用Gumbel-Softmax采样动态选择专家子集。

Result: 在DeepSeek-VL2上，MC#实现6.2倍权重压缩，平均2.57比特，仅导致五个多模态基准上1.7%的准确率下降；OTP减少20%以上专家激活，性能下降小于1%。

Conclusion: MC#通过结合静态比特宽度优化和动态路由，实现了极端的MoE模型压缩，具有高效部署MoE基模型的强大潜力。

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) effectively scales large language models (LLMs) and
vision-language models (VLMs) by increasing capacity through sparse activation.
However, preloading all experts into memory and activating multiple experts per
input introduces significant computational and memory overhead, making the
expert module a major contributor to model size and inference cost. To address
this, we propose MC# (Mixture-Compressor-sharp), a framework that combines
static quantization and dynamic expert pruning by leveraging the significance
of experts and tokens for aggressive compression of MoE-LLMs/VLMs. To reduce
storage and loading costs, we introduce Pre-Loading Mixed-Precision
Quantization (PMQ), which optimizes bit allocation via linear programming,
balancing expert importance and quantization error for a Pareto-optimal
trade-off between size and performance. To reduce runtime computation, Online
Top-any Pruning (OTP) uses Gumbel-Softmax sampling to dynamically select a
subset of experts per token, enabling fine-grained control over activation. By
combining PMQ's static bit-width optimization with OTP's dynamic routing, MC#
achieves extreme compression with minimal accuracy loss. On DeepSeek-VL2, MC#
achieves a 6.2 times weight reduction at 2.57 average bits with only a 1.7%

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于最优传输的自适应边界机制，用于增强Bradley-Terry奖励模型在区分相似偏好响应方面的能力，提高模型性能和泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的Bradley-Terry奖励模型在区分相似偏好响应时效果不佳，容易过拟合简单样本，且在分布外样本上泛化能力不足，导致对齐效果不理想。

Method: 通过语义相似度和模型预测奖励差异，从分布角度设计最优传输成本矩阵，动态调整奖励模型对挑战性样本的关注度。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在多个基准测试中优于现有奖励模型技术，在分布内和分布外设置下均表现出更好的性能、收敛速度和泛化能力。

Conclusion: 基于最优传输的自适应边界机制能有效提升奖励模型的性能，更好地将大语言模型与人类偏好对齐。

Abstract: The reward model (RM) plays a crucial role in aligning Large Language Models
(LLMs) with human preferences through Reinforcement Learning, where the
Bradley-Terry (BT) objective has been recognized as simple yet powerful,
specifically for pairwise preference learning. However, BT-based RMs often
struggle to effectively distinguish between similar preference responses,
leading to insufficient separation between preferred and non-preferred outputs.
Consequently, they may easily overfit easy samples and cannot generalize well
to Out-Of-Distribution (OOD) samples, resulting in suboptimal performance. To
address these challenges, this paper introduces an effective enhancement to
BT-based RMs through an adaptive margin mechanism. Specifically, we design to
dynamically adjust the RM focus on more challenging samples through margins,
based on both semantic similarity and model-predicted reward differences, which
is approached from a distributional perspective solvable with Optimal Transport
(OT). By incorporating these factors into a principled OT cost matrix design,
our adaptive margin enables the RM to better capture distributional differences
between chosen and rejected responses, yielding significant improvements in
performance, convergence speed, and generalization capabilities. Experimental
results across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that our method outperforms
several existing RM techniques, showcasing enhanced performance in both
In-Distribution (ID) and OOD settings. Moreover, RLHF experiments support our
practical effectiveness in better aligning LLMs with human preferences. Our

*Junhyuck Kim,Ethan Ewer,Taehong Moon,Jongho Park,Dimitris Papailiopoulos*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 4-bit量化在推理模型中并非最优选择，KV缓存而非模型大小主导内存使用。研究发现存在规模依赖的权衡：小模型应优先模型容量，大模型应优先生成长度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索推理模型的内存优化策略，发现4-bit量化的通用处方在推理模型中失效，需要针对不同规模模型制定不同策略。

Method: 在AIME25和GPQA-Diamond数据集上进行1700个推理场景的系统实验，分析不同规模模型在内存分配上的权衡。

Result: 发现8B参数为关键阈值：小模型通过分配内存给更多权重获得更好精度，大模型通过分配内存给更长生成获得更好精度。

Conclusion: 推理模型的部署优化需要与推理模型完全不同的策略，不能采用规模无关的方法，需根据模型规模制定原则性指导方针。

Abstract: While 4-bit quantization has emerged as a memory-optimal choice for
non-reasoning models and zero-shot tasks across scales, we show that this
universal prescription fails for reasoning models, where the KV cache rather
than model size can dominate memory. Through systematic experiments across
1,700 inference scenarios on AIME25 and GPQA-Diamond, we find a scale-dependent
trade-off: models with an effective size below 8-bit 4B parameters achieve
better accuracy by allocating memory to more weights rather than longer
generation, while larger models achieve better accuracy by allocating memory to
longer generations. This scale threshold also determines when parallel scaling
becomes memory-efficient and whether KV cache eviction outperforms KV
quantization. Our findings show that memory optimization for LLMs cannot be
scale-agnostic, while providing principled guidelines: for small reasoning
models, prioritize model capacity over test-time compute, while for larger
ones, maximize test-time compute. Our results suggest that optimizing reasoning
models for deployment requires fundamentally different strategies from those
established for non-reasoning models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决科学和工程应用中前向模型导数计算困难的问题，特别是在只能黑盒访问非线性前向模型的情况下进行贝叶斯反演。

Method: 利用扩散模型构建数据驱动先验，通过交互粒子集合进行无导数贝叶斯反演，无需计算前向模型导数。

Result: 理论上建立了非渐近收敛分析，实证上在包括高非线性流体动力学在内的各种反问题上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: Blade能够为贝叶斯反演生成准确且校准良好的后验分布，特别适用于导数计算困难的非线性前向模型。

Abstract: Derivative-free Bayesian inversion is an important task in many science and
engineering applications, particularly when computing the forward model
derivative is computationally and practically challenging. In this paper, we
introduce Blade, which can produce accurate and well-calibrated posteriors for
Bayesian inversion using an ensemble of interacting particles. Blade leverages
powerful data-driven priors based on diffusion models, and can handle nonlinear
forward models that permit only black-box access (i.e., derivative-free).
Theoretically, we establish a non-asymptotic convergence analysis to
characterize the effects of forward model and prior estimation errors.
Empirically, Blade achieves superior performance compared to existing
derivative-free Bayesian inversion methods on various inverse problems,
including challenging highly nonlinear fluid dynamics.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于信息几何的框架来量化表示效率，证明了Barlow Twins方法在特定条件下能达到最优表示效率（η=1）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自监督学习取得了显著成功，但缺乏统一的理论框架来理解和比较不同SSL范式的效率。

Method: 引入信息几何框架，定义表示效率η为学习表示空间的有效内在维度与环境维度的比值，有效维度来自编码器诱导的统计流形上Fisher信息矩阵的谱特性。

Result: 在特定自然假设下，证明了Barlow Twins通过将表示的互相关矩阵驱动到单位矩阵，从而诱导各向同性的FIM，达到最优表示效率。

Conclusion: 为理解Barlow Twins的有效性提供了严格的理论基础，并为分析SSL算法提供了新的几何视角。

Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) has achieved remarkable success by learning
meaningful representations without labeled data. However, a unified theoretical
framework for understanding and comparing the efficiency of different SSL
paradigms remains elusive. In this paper, we introduce a novel
information-geometric framework to quantify representation efficiency. We
define representation efficiency $\eta$ as the ratio between the effective
intrinsic dimension of the learned representation space and its ambient
dimension, where the effective dimension is derived from the spectral
properties of the Fisher Information Matrix (FIM) on the statistical manifold
induced by the encoder. Within this framework, we present a theoretical
analysis of the Barlow Twins method. Under specific but natural assumptions, we
prove that Barlow Twins achieves optimal representation efficiency ($\eta = 1$)
by driving the cross-correlation matrix of representations towards the identity
matrix, which in turn induces an isotropic FIM. This work provides a rigorous
theoretical foundation for understanding the effectiveness of Barlow Twins and
offers a new geometric perspective for analyzing SSL algorithms.

TL;DR: 提出非可转移示例(NEs)，一种无需训练、数据无关的输入侧使用控制机制，通过将输入重新编码到模型特定的低敏感子空间，在保持授权模型性能的同时降低非授权模型的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法要么扰动数据使其不可学习，要么重新训练模型以抑制迁移，但都无法控制未知模型的推理，且通常需要控制训练过程。需要一种能平衡数据效用与保护的方法。

Method: 在模型特定的低敏感子空间中对输入进行重新编码，保持授权模型的输出，同时通过子空间不对齐减少非授权模型的性能。使用Hoffman-Wielandt不等式将性能下降与谱差异联系起来。

Result: NEs在多种视觉骨干网络和最先进的视觉语言模型上保持性能，而非目标模型即使尝试重建也会性能崩溃。

Conclusion: NEs是一种实用的方法，可以在保持预期数据效用的同时防止未经授权的利用。

Abstract: Recent AI regulations call for data that remain useful for innovation while
resistant to misuse, balancing utility with protection at the model level.
Existing approaches either perturb data to make it unlearnable or retrain
models to suppress transfer, but neither governs inference by unknown models,
and both typically require control over training. We propose non-transferable
examples (NEs), a training-free and data-agnostic input-side usage-control
mechanism. We recode inputs within a model-specific low-sensitivity subspace,
preserving outputs for the authorized model while reducing performance on
unauthorized models through subspace misalignment. We establish formal bounds
that guarantee utility for the authorized model and quantify deviation for
unauthorized ones, with the Hoffman-Wielandt inequality linking degradation to
spectral differences. Empirically, NEs retain performance on diverse vision
backbones and state-of-the-art vision-language models under common
preprocessing, whereas non-target models collapse even with reconstruction
attempts. These results establish NEs as a practical means to preserve intended
data utility while preventing unauthorized exploitation. Our project is

Motivation: 现有用户表示建模方法在跨领域泛化性和对噪声行为信号的敏感性方面存在不足，需要更通用和鲁棒的用户表示学习方案。

Result: 在真实世界应用中的广泛实验表明，InstructUE在用户预测、营销和推荐等多个领域显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 指令感知的用户建模能有效实现特定场景下的指令引导去噪，为更通用和鲁棒的用户表示学习开辟了新途径。

Abstract: User representation modeling has become increasingly crucial for personalized
applications, yet existing approaches struggle with generalizability across
domains and sensitivity to noisy behavioral signals. We present InstructUE, an
instruction-aware user embedding foundation model that leverages large language
models (LLMs) to generate general and instruction-aware user representations.
InstructUE introduces a multi-encoder architecture with a lightweight adapter
that efficiently processes heterogeneous data from six different sources while
preserving their structural characteristics. Additionally, it proposes a novel
contrastive-autoregressive training framework that bridges language and
representation spaces through a curated UserQA dataset. The
contrastive-autoregressive training framework simultaneously leverages
autoregressive learning to capture domain knowledge in language space and
contrastive learning to align user-text embeddings in representation space,
thereby enhancing the instruction-awareness and noise-robustness of user
embeddings. Through extensive experiments on real-world applications, we
demonstrate that InstructUE significantly outperforms existing methods across
multiple domains including user prediction, marketing, and recommendation
scenarios. Our results show that instruction-aware user modeling can
effectively achieve instruction-guided denoising of user information in
specific scenarios, paving the way for more generalizable and robust user
representation learning.

TL;DR: 提出了EasyCore框架，通过选择低平均输入梯度范数(AIGN)的简单样本进行训练，显著提升对抗鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有核心集选择算法主要关注干净准确率，无法有效保持对抗鲁棒性，需要从数据角度理解哪些样本对学习鲁棒特征最关键。

Method: 将样本的对抗脆弱性与其硬度相关联，使用AIGN量化样本硬度，提出EasyCore算法选择低AIGN的简单样本组成训练核心集。

Result: 在标准训练和TRADES对抗训练下，EasyCore相比现有核心集方法分别实现7%和5%的对抗准确率提升。

Conclusion: AIGN是模型无关的数据集属性，EasyCore是一种高效且广泛适用的数据中心化方法，可显著改善对抗鲁棒性。

Abstract: Designing adversarially robust models from a data-centric perspective
requires understanding which input samples are most crucial for learning
resilient features. While coreset selection provides a mechanism for efficient
training on data subsets, current algorithms are designed for clean accuracy
and fall short in preserving robustness. To address this, we propose a
framework linking a sample's adversarial vulnerability to its
\textit{hardness}, which we quantify using the average input gradient norm
(AIGN) over training. We demonstrate that \textit{easy} samples (with low AIGN)
are less vulnerable and occupy regions further from the decision boundary.
Leveraging this insight, we present EasyCore, a coreset selection algorithm
that retains only the samples with low AIGN for training. We empirically show
that models trained on EasyCore-selected data achieve significantly higher
adversarial accuracy than those trained with competing coreset methods under
both standard and adversarial training. As AIGN is a model-agnostic dataset
property, EasyCore is an efficient and widely applicable data-centric method
for improving adversarial robustness. We show that EasyCore achieves up to 7\%
and 5\% improvement in adversarial accuracy under standard training and TRADES
adversarial training, respectively, compared to existing coreset methods.

TL;DR: 提出了一种针对图时间序列的保形预测框架，通过利用图结构捕捉节点间依赖关系，在保证指定覆盖概率的同时显著缩小预测区域体积。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有保形预测方法分别应用于多变量时间序列和静态图，但要么忽略了底层图拓扑，要么忽视了时间动态性，需要开发能同时处理图结构和时间动态的预测不确定性量化方法。

Method: 开发了基于保形预测的顺序预测区域框架，利用图结构捕捉节点间成对依赖关系，提供用户指定的覆盖保证。

Result: 理论证明该方案相对于图无关方法实现了椭球预测集体积的指数级缩小。在真实数据集上，新框架在保持期望经验覆盖的同时，预测区域比现有方法显著减小（最多减少80%）。

Conclusion: 该不确定性量化框架成功结合了图结构和时间动态，在保证预测可靠性的同时大幅提高了预测精度。

Abstract: Trustworthy decision making in networked, dynamic environments calls for
innovative uncertainty quantification substrates in predictive models for graph
time series. Existing conformal prediction (CP) methods have been applied
separately to multivariate time series and static graphs, but they either
ignore the underlying graph topology or neglect temporal dynamics. To bridge
this gap, here we develop a CP-based sequential prediction region framework
tailored for graph time series. A key technical innovation is to leverage the
graph structure and thus capture pairwise dependencies across nodes, while
providing user-specified coverage guarantees on the predictive outcomes. We
formally establish that our scheme yields an exponential shrinkage in the
volume of the ellipsoidal prediction set relative to its graph-agnostic
counterpart. Using real-world datasets, we demonstrate that the novel
uncertainty quantification framework maintains desired empirical coverage while
achieving markedly smaller (up to 80% reduction) prediction regions than
existing approaches.

Motivation: 扩散模型在生成过程中会累积误差，特别是在应用任意引导时，这会破坏样本保真度，出现离流形现象。

Method: 使用时间预测器估计每个时间步的流形偏离，设计TAG引导机制在生成过程中将样本吸引回期望流形。

Result: TAG能持续产生与期望流形对齐的样本，在各种下游任务中显著改善生成质量。

Conclusion: TAG是解决扩散模型离流形问题的通用方案，能有效提升引导生成的质量和保真度。

Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved remarkable success as generative models.
However, even a well-trained model can accumulate errors throughout the
generation process. These errors become particularly problematic when arbitrary
guidance is applied to steer samples toward desired properties, which often
breaks sample fidelity. In this paper, we propose a general solution to address
the off-manifold phenomenon observed in diffusion models. Our approach
leverages a time predictor to estimate deviations from the desired data
manifold at each timestep, identifying that a larger time gap is associated
with reduced generation quality. We then design a novel guidance mechanism,
`Temporal Alignment Guidance' (TAG), attracting the samples back to the desired
manifold at every timestep during generation. Through extensive experiments, we
demonstrate that TAG consistently produces samples closely aligned with the
desired manifold at each timestep, leading to significant improvements in
generation quality across various downstream tasks.

Conclusion: 该方法能有效恢复PPG信号同时保持心率准确性，展示了在可穿戴医疗系统中实际部署的潜力。

Abstract: Photoplethysmography (PPG) is widely used in wearable health monitoring, but
its reliability is often degraded by noise and motion artifacts, limiting
downstream applications such as heart rate (HR) estimation. This paper presents
a deep learning framework for PPG denoising with an emphasis on preserving
physiological information. In this framework, we propose DPNet, a Mamba-based
denoising backbone designed for effective temporal modeling. To further enhance
denoising performance, the framework also incorporates a scale-invariant
signal-to-distortion ratio (SI-SDR) loss to promote waveform fidelity and an
auxiliary HR predictor (HRP) that provides physiological consistency through
HR-based supervision. Experiments on the BIDMC dataset show that our method
achieves strong robustness against both synthetic noise and real-world motion
artifacts, outperforming conventional filtering and existing neural models. Our
method can effectively restore PPG signals while maintaining HR accuracy,
highlighting the complementary roles of SI-SDR loss and HR-guided supervision.
These results demonstrate the potential of our approach for practical
deployment in wearable healthcare systems.

Motivation: 多智能体系统和强化学习虽然能增强大语言模型的智能能力，但将在线策略强化学习应用于多智能体系统仍存在挑战，包括算法层面的分组假设失效和系统层面的训练支持不足。

Method: AT-GRPO包括：(i) 针对多智能体系统定制的智能体和轮次分组强化学习算法；(ii) 支持单策略和多策略模式的训练系统。

Result: 在长时程规划任务中，准确率从单智能体强化学习基线的14.0-47.0%提升到96.0-99.5%；在编程任务中平均提升3.87-7.62%，在数学任务中平均提升9.0-17.93%。

Conclusion: AT-GRPO在多智能体强化学习领域取得了显著进展，为多智能体系统提供了有效的训练框架和算法解决方案。

Abstract: Multi-agent systems (MAS) and reinforcement learning (RL) are widely used to
enhance the agentic capabilities of large language models (LLMs). MAS improves
task performance through role-based orchestration, while RL uses environmental
rewards to learn stronger policies, such as GRPO-style optimization. However,
applying on-policy RL to MAS remains underexplored and presents unique
challenges. Algorithmically, standard GRPO grouping assumptions break down
because prompts vary by role and by turn. System-wise, the training stack must
support MAS-workflow rollouts and on-policy updates for both single-policy and
multi-policy models.
  We propose AT-GRPO, which includes (i) an agent- and turn-wise grouped RL
algorithm tailored to MAS and (ii) a training system that supports both single-
and multi-policy regimes. Across game, planning, coding, and math tasks,
AT-GRPO delivers substantial gains. On long-horizon planning, it increases
accuracy from a 14.0 to 47.0 percent single-agent RL baseline to 96.0 to 99.5
percent. It also improves reasoning performance, with average gains of 3.87 to
7.62 percent on coding tasks and 9.0 to 17.93 percent on math. Code and

Conclusion: TED为边缘设备提供了一种实用且可扩展的解决方案，能够在真实世界边缘应用中实现高效、无遗忘的自适应。

Abstract: Edge devices face significant challenges due to limited computational
resources and distribution shifts, making efficient and adaptable machine
learning essential. Existing test-time adaptation (TTA) methods often rely on
gradient-based optimization or batch processing, which are inherently
unsuitable for resource-constrained edge scenarios due to their reliance on
backpropagation and high computational demands. Gradient-free alternatives
address these issues but often suffer from limited learning capacity, lack
flexibility, or impose architectural constraints. To overcome these
limitations, we propose a novel single-instance TTA method tailored for edge
devices (TED), which employs forward-only coordinate optimization in the
principal subspace of latent using the covariance matrix adaptation evolution
strategy (CMA-ES). By updating a compact low-dimensional vector, TED not only
enhances output confidence but also aligns the latent representation closer to
the source latent distribution within the latent principal subspace. This is
achieved without backpropagation, keeping the model parameters frozen, and
enabling efficient, forgetting-free adaptation with minimal memory and
computational overhead. Experiments on image classification and keyword
spotting tasks across the ImageNet and Google Speech Commands series datasets
demonstrate that TED achieves state-of-the-art performance while
$\textit{reducing computational complexity by up to 63 times}$, offering a
practical and scalable solution for real-world edge applications. Furthermore,
we successfully $\textit{deployed TED on the ZYNQ-7020 platform}$,
demonstrating its feasibility and effectiveness for resource-constrained edge
devices in real-world deployments.

Result: 在真实数据集上实验表明，CDRL4AD在准确性和根因分析方面优于最先进方法

Conclusion: 该方法能有效检测异常并识别因果关系，辅助专家诊断异常根因

Abstract: Disentangling complex causal relationships is important for accurate
detection of anomalies. In multivariate time series analysis, dynamic
interactions among data variables over time complicate the interpretation of
causal relationships. Traditional approaches assume statistical independence
between variables in unsupervised settings, whereas recent methods capture
feature correlations through graph representation learning. However, their
representations fail to explicitly infer the causal relationships over
different time periods. To solve the problem, we propose Causally Disentangled
Representation Learning for Anomaly Detection (CDRL4AD) to detect anomalies and
identify their causal relationships in multivariate time series. First, we
design the causal process as model input, the temporal heterogeneous graph, and
causal relationships. Second, our representation identifies causal
relationships over different time periods and disentangles latent variables to
infer the corresponding causal factors. Third, our experiments on real-world
datasets demonstrate that CDRL4AD outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms
of accuracy and root cause analysis. Fourth, our model analysis validates
hyperparameter sensitivity and the time complexity of CDRL4AD. Last, we conduct
a case study to show how our approach assists human experts in diagnosing the
root causes of anomalies.

Result: PhysioME在各种模态缺失场景下实现了高一致性和泛化性能。

Conclusion: PhysioME有望成为现实世界数据不完整情况下支持临床决策的可靠工具。

Abstract: Missing or corrupted modalities are common in physiological signal-based
medical applications owing to hardware constraints or motion artifacts.
However, most existing methods assume the availability of all modalities,
resulting in substantial performance degradation in the absence of any
modality. To overcome this limitation, this study proposes PhysioME, a robust
framework designed to ensure reliable performance under missing modality
conditions. PhysioME adopts: (1) a multimodal self-supervised learning approach
that combines contrastive learning with masked prediction; (2) a
Dual-PathNeuroNet backbone tailored to capture the temporal dynamics of each
physiological signal modality; and (3) a restoration decoder that reconstructs
missing modality tokens, enabling flexible processing of incomplete inputs. The
experimental results show that PhysioME achieves high consistency and
generalization performance across various missing modality scenarios. These
findings highlight the potential of PhysioME as a reliable tool for supporting
clinical decision-making in real-world settings with imperfect data
availability.

demonstrating that a smaller, specialized LLM, when meticulously fine-tuned,
can generate components that surpass expert-crafted heuristics within advanced
solvers. We propose RFTHGS, a novel Reinforcement learning (RL) framework for
Fine-Tuning a small LLM to generate high-performance crossover operators for
the Hybrid Genetic Search (HGS) solver, applied to the Capacitated VRP (CVRP).
Our method employs a multi-tiered, curriculum-based reward function that
progressively guides the LLM to master generating first compilable, then
executable, and finally, superior-performing operators that exceed human expert
designs. This is coupled with an operator caching mechanism that discourages
plagiarism and promotes diversity during training. Comprehensive experiments
show that our fine-tuned LLM produces crossover operators which significantly
outperform the expert-designed ones in HGS. The performance advantage remains
consistent, generalizing from small-scale instances to large-scale problems
with up to 1000 nodes. Furthermore, RFTHGS exceeds the performance of leading
neuro-combinatorial baselines, prompt-based methods, and commercial LLMs such
as GPT-4o and GPT-4o-mini.

TL;DR: 提出MLCM-KD框架，通过双向知识蒸馏解决热成像面部关键点检测中的模态差异问题，实现高效准确的热成像FLD模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 热成像面部关键点检测在恶劣光照条件下很重要，但缺乏丰富的视觉线索。传统的跨模态方法计算成本高或引入结构伪影，限制了实际部署。

Method: 提出多级跨模态知识蒸馏(MLCM-KD)框架，包含双注入知识蒸馏(DIKD)机制，通过双向蒸馏建立模态间连接，确保语义一致性。

Result: 在公开热成像FLD基准测试中达到新的最先进水平，显著优于先前方法，同时大幅降低计算开销。

Conclusion: 该方法成功解决了RGB和热成像数据之间的模态差异问题，实现了鲁棒且深刻的知识迁移，为热成像FLD提供了高效准确的解决方案。

Abstract: Facial Landmark Detection (FLD) in thermal imagery is critical for
applications in challenging lighting conditions, but it is hampered by the lack
of rich visual cues. Conventional cross-modal solutions, like feature fusion or
image translation from RGB data, are often computationally expensive or
introduce structural artifacts, limiting their practical deployment. To address
this, we propose Multi-Level Cross-Modal Knowledge Distillation (MLCM-KD), a
novel framework that decouples high-fidelity RGB-to-thermal knowledge transfer
from model compression to create both accurate and efficient thermal FLD
models. A central challenge during knowledge transfer is the profound modality
gap between RGB and thermal data, where traditional unidirectional distillation
fails to enforce semantic consistency across disparate feature spaces. To
overcome this, we introduce Dual-Injected Knowledge Distillation (DIKD), a
bidirectional mechanism designed specifically for this task. DIKD establishes a
connection between modalities: it not only guides the thermal student with rich
RGB features but also validates the student's learned representations by
feeding them back into the frozen teacher's prediction head. This closed-loop
supervision forces the student to learn modality-invariant features that are
semantically aligned with the teacher, ensuring a robust and profound knowledge
transfer. Experiments show that our approach sets a new state-of-the-art on
public thermal FLD benchmarks, notably outperforming previous methods while
drastically reducing computational overhead.

Abstract: Test-time adaptation aims to improve model robustness under distribution
shifts by adapting models with access to unlabeled target samples. A primary
cause of performance degradation under such shifts is the model's reliance on
features that lack a direct causal relationship with the prediction target. We
introduce Test-time Adaptation by Causal Trimming (TACT), a method that
identifies and removes non-causal components from representations for test
distributions. TACT applies data augmentations that preserve causal features
while varying non-causal ones. By analyzing the changes in the representations
using Principal Component Analysis, TACT identifies the highest variance
directions associated with non-causal features. It trims the representations by
removing their projections on the identified directions, and uses the trimmed
representations for the predictions. During adaptation, TACT continuously
tracks and refines these directions to get a better estimate of non-causal
features. We theoretically analyze the effectiveness of this approach and
empirically validate TACT on real-world out-of-distribution benchmarks. TACT
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods by a significant margin.

Abstract: To adapt kernel two-sample and independence testing to complex structured
data, aggregation of multiple kernels is frequently employed to boost testing
power compared to single-kernel tests. However, we observe a phenomenon that
directly maximizing multiple kernel-based statistics may result in highly
similar kernels that capture highly overlapping information, limiting the
effectiveness of aggregation. To address this, we propose an aggregated
statistic that explicitly incorporates kernel diversity based on the covariance
between different kernels. Moreover, we identify a fundamental challenge: a
trade-off between the diversity among kernels and the test power of individual
kernels, i.e., the selected kernels should be both effective and diverse. This
motivates a testing framework with selection inference, which leverages
information from the training phase to select kernels with strong individual
performance from the learned diverse kernel pool. We provide rigorous
theoretical statements and proofs to show the consistency on the test power and
control of Type-I error, along with asymptotic analysis of the proposed
statistics. Lastly, we conducted extensive empirical experiments demonstrating
the superior performance of our proposed approach across various benchmarks for
both two-sample and independence testing.

Motivation: 现有时间序列异常检测方法缺乏系统性的跨领域评估，需要建立统一的评估框架来比较不同方法的性能。

Method: 构建模块化流水线，集成预处理、四种预测模型（Holt-Winters、SARIMA、LSTM、Informer）、四种检测方法，使用残差检测接口，在NAB数据集上进行全面评估。

Result: LSTM获得最佳性能（F1: 0.688），在81%数据集上排名前二；Informer提供竞争性精度（F1: 0.683）且训练速度快30%；传统方法在简单合成数据上表现完美但真实数据F1分数差2-3倍。

Conclusion: 预测质量主导检测性能，建议复杂模式用LSTM，效率关键部署用Informer，资源受限简单周期性数据用传统方法，为预测式异常检测研究建立基准。

Abstract: Time series anomaly detection is critical for modern digital infrastructures,
yet existing methods lack systematic cross-domain evaluation. We present a
comprehensive forecasting-based framework unifying classical methods
(Holt-Winters, SARIMA) with deep learning architectures (LSTM, Informer) under
a common residual-based detection interface. Our modular pipeline integrates
preprocessing (normalization, STL decomposition), four forecasting models, four
detection methods, and dual evaluation through forecasting metrics (MAE, RMSE,
PCC) and detection metrics (Precision, Recall, F1, AUC). We conduct the first
complete evaluation on the Numenta Anomaly Benchmark (58 datasets, 7
categories) with 232 model training runs and 464 detection evaluations
achieving 100\% success rate. LSTM achieves best performance (F1: 0.688,
ranking first or second on 81\% of datasets) with exceptional correlation on
complex patterns (PCC: 0.999). Informer provides competitive accuracy (F1:
0.683) with 30\% faster training. Classical methods achieve perfect predictions
on simple synthetic data with 60 lower cost but show 2-3 worse F1-scores on
real-world datasets. Forecasting quality dominates detection performance:
differences between detection methods (F1: 0.621-0.688) are smaller than
between forecasting models (F1: 0.344-0.688). Our findings provide
evidence-based guidance: use LSTM for complex patterns, Informer for
efficiency-critical deployments, and classical methods for simple periodic data
with resource constraints. The complete implementation and results establish
baselines for future forecasting-based anomaly detection research.

Abstract: Understanding how learning algorithms shape the computational strategies that
emerge in neural networks remains a fundamental challenge in machine
intelligence. While network architectures receive extensive attention, the role
of the learning paradigm itself in determining emergent dynamics remains
largely unexplored. Here we demonstrate that reinforcement learning (RL) and
supervised learning (SL) drive recurrent neural networks (RNNs) toward
fundamentally different computational solutions when trained on identical
decision-making tasks. Through systematic dynamical systems analysis, we reveal
that RL spontaneously discovers hybrid attractor architectures, combining
stable fixed-point attractors for decision maintenance with quasi-periodic
attractors for flexible evidence integration. This contrasts sharply with SL,
which converges almost exclusively to simpler fixed-point-only solutions. We
further show that RL sculpts functionally balanced neural populations through a
powerful form of implicit regularization -- a structural signature that
enhances robustness and is conspicuously absent in the more heterogeneous
solutions found by SL-trained networks. The prevalence of these complex
dynamics in RL is controllably modulated by weight initialization and
correlates strongly with performance gains, particularly as task complexity
increases. Our results establish the learning algorithm as a primary
determinant of emergent computation, revealing how reward-based optimization
autonomously discovers sophisticated dynamical mechanisms that are less
accessible to direct gradient-based optimization. These findings provide both
mechanistic insights into neural computation and actionable principles for
designing adaptive AI systems.

Abstract: The use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) models in real-world and high-risk
applications has intensified the discussion about their trustworthiness and
ethical usage, from both a technical and a legislative perspective. The field
of eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) addresses this challenge by
proposing explanations that bring to light the decision-making processes of
complex black-box models. Despite being an essential property, the robustness
of explanations is often an overlooked aspect during development: only robust
explanation methods can increase the trust in the system as a whole. This paper
investigates the role of robustness through the usage of a feature importance
aggregation derived from multiple models ($k$-nearest neighbours, random forest
and neural networks). Preliminary results showcase the potential in increasing
the trustworthiness of the application, while leveraging multiple model's
predictive power.

TL;DR: 提出了ELMO框架，使用BFloat16和Float8数据类型进行纯低精度训练，通过Kahan求和和随机舍入技术，在极端多标签分类任务中显著减少GPU内存使用，同时保持准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 极端多标签分类(XMC)中，线性分类头成为计算和内存需求的主要驱动因素。现有FP16-FP32混合精度训练存在不稳定、内存使用效率低和计算开销大的问题，而现有低精度方法通常仍为分类层保留更高精度。

Method: 提出ELMO框架，使用BFloat16和Float8数据类型进行纯低精度训练，结合Kahan求和和随机舍入技术，无需依赖单精度主权重或张量缩放。采用梯度融合和分块等内存优化技术。

Result: 成功训练了300万标签的XMC模型，仅使用6.6 GiB GPU内存，而优化后的SOTA方法Renee需要39.7 GiB内存，且没有牺牲准确性。

Conclusion: ELMO框架证明了XMC模型可以完全在Float8中有效训练，显著减少内存使用，为大规模多标签分类任务提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Large output spaces, also referred to as Extreme multilabel classification
(XMC), is a setting that arises, e.g., in large-scale tagging and
product-to-product recommendation, and is characterized by the number of labels
ranging from hundreds of thousands to millions. This means that the linear
classification head, usually only a tiny fraction of the overall model, turns
into the main driver for compute and memory demand. Current state-of-the-art
XMC methods predominantly rely on FP16-FP32 mixed-precision training, which we
show can be unstable, and inefficient in terms of memory usage and
computational overhead. Meanwhile, existing low-precision methods typically
retain higher precision for the classification layer. In this work, we propose
ELMO, a pure low-precision training framework for XMC models using BFloat16 and
Float8 data types. By leveraging Kahan summation and stochastic rounding, we
demonstrate that XMC models can be effectively trained entirely in Float8,
without relying on single-precision master weights or tensor scaling.
Low-precision training, combined with our proposed memory optimizations --
gradient fusion and chunking -- enables significant reductions in GPU memory
usage. For example, we train a 3-million-label XMC model with only 6.6 GiB of
GPU memory, compared to the 39.7 GiB required by the optimized SOTA method,
Renee without compromising accuracy.

TL;DR: EAGer是一种无需训练的生代方法，通过基于token熵分布的不确定性来动态分配计算预算，在复杂推理任务中减少冗余计算并提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 不同提示具有不同的复杂度，需要不同的计算资源分配。当前方法对所有提示分配相同计算预算，存在冗余计算问题。

Method: 利用token-wise熵分布检测不确定性，仅在遇到高熵token时分支到多个推理路径，并将节省的计算预算重新分配给最需要探索替代路径的实例。

Result: 在AIME 2025等复杂推理基准测试中，EAGer无需目标标签即可重新分配预算，在推理长度和Pass@k方面达到最佳效率-性能平衡。有目标标签时，相比Full Parallel Sampling生成token减少65%，Pass@k提升37%。

Conclusion: EAGer通过基于不确定性的动态计算预算分配，有效提升了推理模型的效率和性能，为测试时扩展方法提供了新的优化方向。

Abstract: With the rise of reasoning language models and test-time scaling methods as a
paradigm for improving model performance, substantial computation is often
required to generate multiple candidate sequences from the same prompt. This
enables exploration of different reasoning paths toward the correct solution,
however, allocates the same compute budget for each prompt. Grounded on the
assumption that different prompts carry different degrees of complexity, and
thus different computation needs, we propose EAGer, a training-free generation
method that leverages model uncertainty through token-wise entropy distribution
to reduce redundant computation and concurrently improve overall performance.
EAGer allows branching to multiple reasoning paths only in the presence of
high-entropy tokens, and then reallocates the saved compute budget to the
instances where exploration of alternative paths is most needed. We find that
across multiple open-source models on complex reasoning benchmarks such as AIME
2025, EAGer can reallocate the budget without accessing target labels,
achieving the best efficiency-performance trade-off in terms of reasoning
length and Pass@k. When target labels are accessible, EAGer generates up to 65%
fewer tokens (hence saving compute) and achieves up to 37% improvement in
Pass@k compared to the Full Parallel Sampling.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
capabilities in reasoning and tool utilization. However, the generalization of
tool-augmented reinforcement learning (RL) across diverse domains remains
underexplored. In this work, we investigate the cross-domain generalization of
an LLM agent equipped with a code interpreter tool, which is exclusively
trained on mathematical problem-solving tasks. Despite the restricted training
domain, we evaluate the agent's performance across several distinct reasoning
domains. The results reveal that RL-based tool usage learned from mathematical
tasks can be effectively transferred to complex tasks in other domains,
enabling great task performance and high token efficiency. To facilitate this
cross-domain transfer, we propose a Tool Generalization Reinforcement Learning
(TGRL) framework designed to promote domain-agnostic learning and skill
migration, encompassing: (i) a standardized tool interface that abstracts
domain-specific nuances through consistent formatting and explicit termination,
fostering transferable invocation patterns; (ii) a dual-component reward system
that decomposes rewards to incentivize generalizable behaviors like tool
efficiency and reasoning abstraction, ensuring alignment and robustness across
domain shifts; and (iii) an XML-based prompt template that separates thinking,
tool calls, and responses to encourage modular, domain-invariant planning and
coherent multi-turn interactions. Extensive experiments across diverse
benchmarks validate our approach, achieving state-of-the-art performance and
highlighting the cross-domain potential of Tool RL for LLM reasoning.

Abstract: Deciphering the function of unseen protein sequences is a fundamental
challenge with broad scientific impact, yet most existing methods depend on
task-specific adapters or large-scale supervised fine-tuning. We introduce the
"Protein-as-Second-Language" framework, which reformulates amino-acid sequences
as sentences in a novel symbolic language that large language models can
interpret through contextual exemplars. Our approach adaptively constructs
sequence-question-answer triples that reveal functional cues in a zero-shot
setting, without any further training. To support this process, we curate a
bilingual corpus of 79,926 protein-QA instances spanning attribute prediction,
descriptive understanding, and extended reasoning. Empirically, our method
delivers consistent gains across diverse open-source LLMs and GPT-4, achieving
up to 17.2% ROUGE-L improvement (average +7%) and even surpassing fine-tuned
protein-specific language models. These results highlight that generic LLMs,
when guided with protein-as-language cues, can outperform domain-specialized
models, offering a scalable pathway for protein understanding in foundation
models.

Conclusion: 当前的漏洞检测模型存在严重的偏差问题，其预测往往受到非漏洞代码行的影响，需要通过检测对齐等方法更好地评估和改进模型的定位能力。

Abstract: To address the extremely concerning problem of software vulnerability, system
security is often entrusted to Machine Learning (ML) algorithms. Despite their
now established detection capabilities, such models are limited by design to
flagging the entire input source code function as vulnerable, rather than
precisely localizing the concerned code lines. However, the detection
granularity is crucial to support human operators during software development,
ensuring that such predictions reflect the true code semantics to help debug,
evaluate, and fix the detected vulnerabilities. To address this issue, recent
work made progress toward improving the detector's localization ability, thus
narrowing down the vulnerability detection "window" and providing more
fine-grained predictions. Such approaches, however, implicitly disregard the
presence of spurious correlations and biases in the data, which often
predominantly influence the performance of ML algorithms. In this work, we
investigate how detectors comply with this requirement by proposing an
explainability-based evaluation procedure. Our approach, defined as Detection
Alignment (DA), quantifies the agreement between the input source code lines
that most influence the prediction and the actual localization of the
vulnerability as per the ground truth. Through DA, which is model-agnostic and
adaptable to different detection tasks, not limited to our use case, we analyze
multiple learning-based vulnerability detectors and datasets. As a result, we
show how the predictions of such models are consistently biased by
non-vulnerable lines, ultimately highlighting the high impact of biases and
spurious correlations. The code is available at

Abstract: Many machine learning applications require outputs that satisfy complex,

Network models due to the variable output sizes of graph-structured data. In
this paper, we introduce ProjNet, a Graph Neural Network framework which
satisfies input-dependant constraints. ProjNet combines a sparse vector
clipping method with the Component-Averaged Dykstra (CAD) algorithm, an
iterative scheme for solving the best-approximation problem. We establish a
convergence result for CAD and develop a GPU-accelerated implementation capable
of handling large-scale inputs efficiently. To enable end-to-end training, we
introduce a surrogate gradient for CAD that is both computationally efficient
and better suited for optimization than the exact gradient. We validate ProjNet
on four classes of constrained optimisation problems: linear programming, two
classes of non-convex quadratic programs, and radio transmit power
optimization, demonstrating its effectiveness across diverse problem settings.

Conclusion: NWC框架成功解决了语言模型权重压缩的独特挑战，为这一新兴数据模态提供了有效的学习压缩方法。

Abstract: The efficient storage and transmission of language model weights is becoming
increasingly important, as their scale and adoption continue to grow. However,
as our understanding of this new data modality is limited, designing a good
compression algorithm for language model weights heavily relies on manual,
trial-and-error approaches. In this paper, we propose a learned compression
framework that trains neural codecs directly from pretrained language model
weights. Unlike conventional data (e.g., images), language model weights pose
unique challenges: the sizes and shapes of weight tensors vary significantly,
and the reconstruction quality must be judged by downstream model predictions
rather than na\"ive MSE loss. To address this, we introduce Neural Weight
Compression (NWC), a novel autoencoder-based neural codec tailored to model
weight compression. The proposed method inherits the advantages of
autoencoder-based codecs while incorporating three technical components: (1)
column-wise tensor chunking and normalization; (2) an importance-aware training
loss; (3) an inference-time error compensation mechanism guided by model
outputs. Experiments on open-weight language models show that NWC achieves
competitive or state-of-the-art accuracy-compression tradeoffs, with
particularly strong results at 4-6 bit precisions where accuracy remains nearly
on par with FP16 models.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种从观测信号中学习连接图(Connection Graphs)的框架SCGL，通过最大伪似然和一致性假设，联合推断网络拓扑、边权重和几何结构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 连接图将网络拓扑与正交变换结合，能表示全局几何一致性，在同步、黎曼信号处理和神经束扩散中很重要，但如何直接从观测信号学习连接图是一个未解决的逆问题。

Method: 基于最大伪似然和一致性假设的框架，提出SCGL算法——在黎曼流形上进行块优化的过程，联合学习网络拓扑、边权重和几何结构。

Result: 实验表明SCGL在拓扑恢复和几何保真度方面始终优于现有基线方法，同时保持计算效率。

Conclusion: SCGL提供了一个原则性的框架来学习连接图，在多个关键指标上优于现有方法，为连接图学习问题提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Connection graphs (CGs) extend traditional graph models by coupling network
topology with orthogonal transformations, enabling the representation of global
geometric consistency. They play a key role in applications such as
synchronization, Riemannian signal processing, and neural sheaf diffusion. In
this work, we address the inverse problem of learning CGs directly from
observed signals. We propose a principled framework based on maximum
pseudo-likelihood under a consistency assumption, which enforces spectral
properties linking the connection Laplacian to the underlying combinatorial
Laplacian. Based on this formulation, we introduce the Structured Connection
Graph Learning (SCGL) algorithm, a block-optimization procedure over Riemannian
manifolds that jointly infers network topology, edge weights, and geometric
structure. Our experiments show that SCGL consistently outperforms existing
baselines in both topological recovery and geometric fidelity, while remaining
computationally efficient.

TL;DR: 提出了一种快速半监督图嵌入框架，通过联合优化结构保持、监督正则化和半监督传播三个目标，在缺乏节点特征的情况下实现高效节点分类。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实图中许多节点缺乏信息丰富的特征向量，仅依赖邻域连接性和类别标签，需要学习能捕捉结构角色和拓扑上下文的节点嵌入。

Method: 联合优化三个互补目标：无监督结构保持（可扩展模块度近似）、监督正则化（最小化标记节点类内方差）、半监督传播（基于随机游走的注意力加权标签传播）。

Result: 在标准基准测试中，分类准确率与最先进方法相当或更优，同时计算成本显著降低。

Conclusion: 该框架能够生成高质量节点嵌入，在计算效率和分类性能之间取得良好平衡。

Abstract: Graph-based learning is a cornerstone for analyzing structured data, with
node classification as a central task. However, in many real-world graphs,
nodes lack informative feature vectors, leaving only neighborhood connectivity
and class labels as available signals. In such cases, effective classification
hinges on learning node embeddings that capture structural roles and
topological context. We introduce a fast semi-supervised embedding framework
that jointly optimizes three complementary objectives: (i) unsupervised
structure preservation via scalable modularity approximation, (ii) supervised
regularization to minimize intra-class variance among labeled nodes, and (iii)
semi-supervised propagation that refines unlabeled nodes through
random-walk-based label spreading with attention-weighted similarity. These
components are unified into a single iterative optimization scheme, yielding
high-quality node embeddings. On standard benchmarks, our method consistently
achieves classification accuracy at par with or superior to state-of-the-art
approaches, while requiring significantly less computational cost.

Conclusion: 该解决方案前景良好，特别是在无标签数据可用性可能增加的情况下。

Abstract: As clinical data are becoming increasingly available, machine learning
methods have been employed to extract knowledge from them and predict clinical
events. While promising, approaches suffer from at least two main issues: low
availability of labelled data and data heterogeneity leading to missing values.
This work proposes the use of self-supervised auto-encoders to efficiently
address these challenges. We apply our methodology to a clinical dataset from
patients with ischaemic heart disease. Patient data is embedded in a latent
space, built using unlabelled data, which is then used to train a neural
network classifier to predict cardiovascular death. Results show improved
balanced accuracy compared to applying the classifier directly to the raw data,
demonstrating that this solution is promising, especially in conditions where
availability of unlabelled data could increase.

Motivation: 解决联邦高效微调中客户端漂移导致的全局模型泛化能力下降问题，以及本地模型无法满足个性化需求的问题，同时现有方法缺乏对调优矩阵的细粒度分析。

Method: 使用细粒度联邦LoRA调优方法，分别微调A矩阵中更敏感的方向向量（编码共享知识）和B矩阵中更敏感的幅度向量（编码个性化知识），采用全局和局部优化器组合的流水线。

Result: 在Databricks-Dolly-15k和Natural Instructions数据集上使用LLaMA2-7B和Deepseek-7B模型进行实验，全局性能提升0.39%，本地性能提升0.59%。

Conclusion: 该方法在异构数据场景下有效提升了全局模型的泛化能力和本地模型的个性化适配能力，实现了全局和局部层面的协同优化。

Abstract: Federated efficient fine-tuning has emerged as an approach that leverages
distributed data and computational resources across nodes to address the
challenges of large-scale fine-tuning and privacy preservation. The Low-Rank
Adaptation (LoRA) enables efficient fine-tuning of large-scale pre-trained
models by introducing trainable low-rank matrices into weight updates.However,
in heterogeneous data scenarios, client drift weakens the generalization of the
global model, and local models often fail to meet the personalized needs of
individual clients.Moreover, existing federated LoRA efficient fine-tuning
techniques overlook fine-grained analysis of the tuning matrices. To address
this, we conducted preliminary experiments and found that different LoRA
matrices exhibit different sensitivity to changes in the direction and
magnitude of their vectors.We thus propose a fine-grained federated LoRA tuning
method. By fine-tuning the more sensitive directional vectors in the A matrix,
which encode shared knowledge, our method learns shared features more
effectively across clients and enhances global generalization. Simultaneously,
by fine-tuning the more sensitive magnitude vectors in the B matrix, which
encode personalized knowledge, our method better captures personalized
knowledge, enabling detailed adaptation to local data. The method uses a
pipeline combining global and local optimizers. Global optimization further
improves local models, achieving collaborative optimization between global and
local levels. This improves both the generalization ability of the global model
and the personalized adaptation of local models under heterogeneous data
scenarios. Experiments on Databricks-Dolly-15k and Natural Instructions with
LLaMA2-7B and Deepseek-7B confirm that our method improves global performance
by 0.39% and local performance by 0.59%.

TL;DR: ENIGMA是一种新的LLM训练方法，通过将组织政策视为信息流形上的移动方向，同时提升推理能力、对齐性和鲁棒性。该方法结合了GRPO强化学习、SAMI辅助训练和Sinkhorn正则化，无需奖励模型即可实现原则性推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的LLM训练方法往往将推理、对齐和鲁棒性视为独立目标，而作者认为这些实际上是单一信息几何目标的不同投影。通过将组织政策作为信息流形上的移动方向，可以统一优化这些能力。

Method: ENIGMA采用单循环训练器，结合：1）GRPO（无评论家的策略优化方法），仅使用思维链格式奖励；2）SAMI风格的对称InfoNCE辅助训练；3）隐藏状态分布的Sinkhorn最优传输正则化器来限制几何漂移。

Result: 在1B参数的小型LLM实验中，高充分性指数（SI）的原则预测了更稳定的训练动态和优于GRPO消融实验的基准性能。信息几何分析验证了流形结构的理想变化。

Conclusion: ENIGMA支持了推理、对齐和鲁棒性是单一信息几何目标投影的假设，无需奖励模型即可训练出具有原则性推理能力的模型，为可信能力提供了一条路径。

Abstract: We present Entropic Mutual-Information Geometry Large-Language Model
Alignment (ENIGMA), a novel approach to Large-Language Model (LLM) training
that jointly improves reasoning, alignment and robustness by treating an
organisation's policies/principles as directions to move on a model's
information manifold. Our single-loop trainer combines Group-Relative Policy
Optimisation (GRPO), an on-policy, critic-free RL method with Chain-of-Thought
(CoT)-format only rewards; a Self-Supervised Alignment with Mutual Information
(SAMI)-style symmetric InfoNCE auxiliary; and an entropic Sinkhorn
optimal-transport regulariser on hidden-state distributions to bound geometry
drift. We also introduce infoNCE metrics that specialise to a standard MI lower
bound under matched negatives to measure how strongly a model's CoT encodes
these policies. These metrics include a Sufficiency Index (SI) that enables the
selection and creation of principles that maximise downstream performance prior
to training. In our experiments using small (1B) LLMs, high-SI principles
predict steadier training dynamics and improved benchmark performance over GRPO
ablations. Our information-geometry analysis of trained models validates
desirable structural change in the manifold. These results support our
hypothesis that reasoning, alignment, and robustness are projections of a
single informationgeometric objective, and that models trained using ENIGMA
demonstrate principled reasoning without the use of a reward model, offering a
path to trusted capability

Method: 使用Vision-LLM视觉编码器处理历史全局交通矩阵作为图像序列；引入高效编码方案将浮点值表示为单令牌；采用两阶段微调：监督微调(SFT)和基于GRPO的强化学习优化。

Result: 在真实移动流量数据集上，ST-Vision-LLM在长期预测准确性上比现有方法提升15.6%，在跨域少样本场景中超过第二佳基线30.04%。

Conclusion: 该模型在各种数据稀缺环境中表现出强大的泛化能力，验证了所提框架的有效性。

Abstract: Accurate spatiotemporal traffic forecasting is a critical prerequisite for
proactive resource management in dense urban mobile networks. While Large
Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in time series analysis, they
inherently struggle to model the complex spatial dependencies of grid-based
traffic data. Effectively extending LLMs to this domain is challenging, as
representing the vast amount of information from dense geographical grids can
be inefficient and overwhelm the model's context. To address these challenges,
we propose ST-Vision-LLM, a novel framework that reframes spatiotemporal
forecasting as a vision-language fusion problem. Our approach leverages a
Vision-LLM visual encoder to process historical global traffic matrices as
image sequences, providing the model with a comprehensive global view to inform
cell-level predictions. To overcome the inefficiency of LLMs in handling
numerical data, we introduce an efficient encoding scheme that represents
floating-point values as single tokens via a specialized vocabulary, coupled
with a two-stage numerical alignment fine-tuning process. The model is first
trained with Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and then further optimized for
predictive accuracy using Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), a
memory-efficient reinforcement learning method. Evaluations on real-world
mobile traffic datasets demonstrate that ST-Vision-LLM outperforms existing
methods by 15.6% in long-term prediction accuracy and exceeds the second-best
baseline by over 30.04% in cross-domain few-shot scenarios. Our extensive
experiments validate the model's strong generalization capabilities across
various data-scarce environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的KV缓存检索方法存在效率和准确性瓶颈，特别是在长输出推理场景中。随着大型推理模型的出现，高效处理长序列场景变得越来越重要。

Method: 基于关键KV具有强时间局部性和在输入提示与生成输出中呈现不同分布模式的观察，提出语义感知检索策略（仅在语义边界触发检索）和解耦的细粒度管理方案（为输入和输出序列定制差异化策略）。

Result: 评估显示LouisKV相比最先进的KV检索方法实现了高达4.7倍的加速，同时在各种长序列任务中保持接近无损的准确性。

Conclusion: LouisKV通过利用KV的时间局部性和分布特性，结合内核级优化，为长序列场景提供了高效且准确的KV缓存检索解决方案。

Abstract: While Key-Value (KV) cache succeeds in reducing redundant computations in
auto-regressive models, it introduces significant memory overhead, limiting its
practical deployment in long-sequence scenarios. Existing KV retrieval methods
mitigate this by dynamically retaining only a subset of KV entries on the GPU.
However, they still suffer from notable efficiency and accuracy bottlenecks due
to per-token retrieval and coarse-grained page-level KV management, especially
in long-output reasoning scenarios. With the emergence of large reasoning
models, efficiently handling such scenarios has become increasingly important.
To address this issue, we present two key observations: (1) critical KVs
exhibit strong temporal locality during decoding, and (2) these KVs exhibit
distinct distribution patterns across the input prompt and generated output.
Building on these observations, we propose LouisKV, an efficient KV cache
retrieval framework designed for various long-sequence scenarios. Specifically,
LouisKV introduces a semantic-aware retrieval strategy leveraging temporal
locality to trigger retrieval only at semantic boundaries, drastically reducing
computation and data transfer overhead. LouisKV also designs a decoupled,
fine-grained management scheme that tailors differentiated strategies for input
and output sequences to create retrieval units that better match the model's
attention patterns, enabling precise identification of critical KVs.
Furthermore, to boost efficiency, LouisKV incorporates several kernel-level
optimizations, including custom Triton and CUDA kernels to accelerate the KV
clustering and retrieval. Evaluations show that LouisKV achieves up to
4.7$\times$ speedup over state-of-the-art KV retrieval methods while
maintaining near-lossless accuracy across diverse long-sequence tasks,
including long-input short-output, short-input long-output, and long-input
long-output scenarios.

Conclusion: DiffTSST是一个有效的时序数据风格迁移框架，在数据增强应用中具有实际价值，特别是在数据稀缺情况下能提升异常检测等任务的性能。

Abstract: Style transfer combines the content of one signal with the style of another.
It supports applications such as data augmentation and scenario simulation,
helping machine learning models generalize in data-scarce domains. While well
developed in vision and language, style transfer methods for time series data
remain limited. We introduce DiffTSST, a diffusion-based framework that
disentangles a time series into content and style representations via
convolutional encoders and recombines them through a self-supervised
attention-based diffusion process. At inference, encoders extract content and
style from two distinct series, enabling conditional generation of novel
samples to achieve style transfer. We demonstrate both qualitatively and
quantitatively that DiffTSST achieves effective style transfer. We further
validate its real-world utility by showing that data augmentation with DiffTSST
improves anomaly detection in data-scarce regimes.

Abstract: Real-world graph typically evolve via a series of events, modeling dynamic
interactions between objects across various domains. For dynamic graph
learning, dynamic graph neural networks (DGNNs) have emerged as popular
solutions. Recently, prompt learning methods have been explored on dynamic
graphs. However, existing methods generally focus on capturing the relationship
between nodes and time, while overlooking the impact of historical events. In
this paper, we propose EVP, an event-aware dynamic graph prompt learning
framework that can serve as a plug-in to existing methods, enhancing their
ability to leverage historical events knowledge. First, we extract a series of
historical events for each node and introduce an event adaptation mechanism to
align the fine-grained characteristics of these events with downstream tasks.
Second, we propose an event aggregation mechanism to effectively integrate
historical knowledge into node representations. Finally, we conduct extensive
experiments on four public datasets to evaluate and analyze EVP.

Abstract: Synchronous Reinforcement Learning (RL) post-training has emerged as a
crucial step for enhancing Large Language Models (LLMs) with diverse
capabilities. However, many systems designed to accelerate RL post-training
still suffer from low resource utilization and limited scalability. We present
ROLL Flash, a system that extends ROLL with native support for asynchronous RL
post-training. ROLL Flash is built upon two core design principles:
fine-grained parallelism and rollout-train decoupling. Guided by these
principles, ROLL Flash provides flexible programming interfaces that enable a
fully asynchronous training architecture and support efficient rollout
mechanisms, including queue scheduling and environment-level asynchronous
execution. Through comprehensive theoretical analysis and extensive
experiments, we demonstrate that ROLL Flash significantly improves resource
utilization and scalability over synchronous RL post-training. ROLL Flash
achieves up to 2.24x speedup on RLVR tasks and 2.72x on agentic tasks, using
the same GPU budget as synchronous baselines. Furthermore, we implement several
popular off-policy algorithms and verify that asynchronous training can achieve
performance on par with synchronous training.

TL;DR: 提出MFP框架，通过多视图特征传播解决图神经网络在特征稀疏和隐私保护方面的挑战，在保持分类性能的同时显著减少隐私泄露。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实场景中图数据特征矩阵通常高度稀疏或包含敏感信息，导致传统GNN性能下降和隐私风险增加。需要同时解决特征缺失和隐私保护问题。

Method: 将可用特征划分为多个添加高斯噪声的视图，每个视图通过图拓扑独立传播信息，最后聚合生成鲁棒的节点嵌入表示。

Result: 在多个图数据集上的实验表明，MFP在节点分类任务上优于现有基线方法，同时显著减少了隐私泄露。传播输出作为原始特征的替代插补而非重建。

Conclusion: MFP为具有缺失或敏感特征的图学习领域提供了一个有效且隐私感知的框架，在极端稀疏情况下保持鲁棒性，并在效用和隐私之间实现平衡。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated remarkable success in node
classification tasks over relational data, yet their effectiveness often
depends on the availability of complete node features. In many real-world
scenarios, however, feature matrices are highly sparse or contain sensitive
information, leading to degraded performance and increased privacy risks.
Furthermore, direct exposure of information can result in unintended data
leakage, enabling adversaries to infer sensitive information. To address these
challenges, we propose a novel Multi-view Feature Propagation (MFP) framework
that enhances node classification under feature sparsity while promoting
privacy preservation. MFP extends traditional Feature Propagation (FP) by
dividing the available features into multiple Gaussian-noised views, each
propagating information independently through the graph topology. The
aggregated representations yield expressive and robust node embeddings. This
framework is novel in two respects: it introduces a mechanism that improves
robustness under extreme sparsity, and it provides a principled way to balance
utility with privacy. Extensive experiments conducted on graph datasets
demonstrate that MFP outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in node
classification while substantially reducing privacy leakage. Moreover, our
analysis demonstrates that propagated outputs serve as alternative imputations
rather than reconstructions of the original features, preserving utility
without compromising privacy. A comprehensive sensitivity analysis further
confirms the stability and practical applicability of MFP across diverse
scenarios. Overall, MFP provides an effective and privacy-aware framework for
graph learning in domains characterized by missing or sensitive features.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有理论工作主要分析全批量Adam，但实践中使用的是随机版本。随机Adam即使学习率很小也不会收敛到全批量版本，这与SGD不同，需要理论分析批量大小对Adam泛化的影响。

Method: 理论分析两层过参数化CNN在图像数据上的表现，比较Adam和AdamW在不同批量大小下的泛化性能，并推导有效权重衰减界限。

Result: 研究发现小批量Adam可以取得接近零的测试误差，而全批量版本收敛到较差的解。Adam的有效权重衰减界限严格小于AdamW，解释了为什么Adam需要更敏感的权重衰减调参。

Conclusion: 批量大小和权重衰减在Adam的泛化性能中起关键作用，小批量训练可以显著改善Adam的泛化能力，这为实践中Adam的使用提供了理论指导。

Abstract: Adam is a popular and widely used adaptive gradient method in deep learning,
which has also received tremendous focus in theoretical research. However, most
existing theoretical work primarily analyzes its full-batch version, which
differs fundamentally from the stochastic variant used in practice. Unlike SGD,
stochastic Adam does not converge to its full-batch counterpart even with
infinitesimal learning rates. We present the first theoretical characterization
of how batch size affects Adam's generalization, analyzing two-layer
over-parameterized CNNs on image data. Our results reveal that while both Adam
and AdamW with proper weight decay $\lambda$ converge to poor test error
solutions, their mini-batch variants can achieve near-zero test error. We
further prove Adam has a strictly smaller effective weight decay bound than
AdamW, theoretically explaining why Adam requires more sensitive $\lambda$
tuning. Extensive experiments validate our findings, demonstrating the critical
role of batch size and weight decay in Adam's generalization performance.

Motivation: 理解LLMs如何表示和处理医学知识，为医学任务的微调、遗忘或去偏提供指导。

Method: 使用四种可解释性技术：UMAP投影中间激活、基于梯度的显著性分析、层切除/移除和激活修补。

Result: 发现医学知识主要在前半层处理；年龄在中间层非线性编码；疾病进展表示非单调；药物按医学专科聚类；某些模型中间层激活崩溃但最终恢复。

Conclusion: 这些发现可为医学任务LLMs的优化提供具体层级的指导建议。

Abstract: We present a systematic study of medical-domain interpretability in Large
Language Models (LLMs). We study how the LLMs both represent and process
medical knowledge through four different interpretability techniques: (1) UMAP
projections of intermediate activations, (2) gradient-based saliency with
respect to the model weights, (3) layer lesioning/removal and (4) activation
patching. We present knowledge maps of five LLMs which show, at a
coarse-resolution, where knowledge about patient's ages, medical symptoms,
diseases and drugs is stored in the models. In particular for Llama3.3-70B, we
find that most medical knowledge is processed in the first half of the model's
layers. In addition, we find several interesting phenomena: (i) age is often
encoded in a non-linear and sometimes discontinuous manner at intermediate
layers in the models, (ii) the disease progression representation is
non-monotonic and circular at certain layers of the model, (iii) in
Llama3.3-70B, drugs cluster better by medical specialty rather than mechanism
of action, especially for Llama3.3-70B and (iv) Gemma3-27B and MedGemma-27B
have activations that collapse at intermediate layers but recover by the final
layers. These results can guide future research on fine-tuning, un-learning or
de-biasing LLMs for medical tasks by suggesting at which layers in the model
these techniques should be applied.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) emerges as a new learning paradigm that enables
multiple devices to collaboratively train a shared model while preserving data
privacy. However, one fundamental and prevailing challenge that hinders the
deployment of FL on mobile devices is the memory limitation. This paper
proposes \textit{FedHybrid}, a novel framework that effectively reduces the
memory footprint during the training process while guaranteeing the model
accuracy and the overall training progress. Specifically, \textit{FedHybrid}
first selects the participating devices for each training round by jointly
evaluating their memory budget, computing capability, and data diversity. After
that, it judiciously analyzes the computational graph and generates an
execution plan for each selected client in order to meet the corresponding
memory budget while minimizing the training delay through employing a hybrid of
recomputation and compression techniques according to the characteristic of
each tensor. During the local training process, \textit{FedHybrid} carries out
the execution plan with a well-designed activation compression technique to
effectively achieve memory reduction with minimum accuracy loss. We conduct
extensive experiments to evaluate \textit{FedHybrid} on both simulation and
off-the-shelf mobile devices. The experiment results demonstrate that
\textit{FedHybrid} achieves up to a 39.1\% increase in model accuracy and a
15.5$\times$ reduction in wall clock time under various memory budgets compared
with the baselines.

Abstract: The creation of systematic literature reviews (SLR) is critical for analyzing
the landscape of a research field and guiding future research directions.
However, retrieving and filtering the literature corpus for an SLR is highly
time-consuming and requires extensive manual effort, as keyword-based searches
in digital libraries often return numerous irrelevant publications. In this
work, we propose a pipeline leveraging multiple large language models (LLMs),
classifying papers based on descriptive prompts and deciding jointly using a
consensus scheme. The entire process is human-supervised and interactively
controlled via our open-source visual analytics web interface, LLMSurver, which
enables real-time inspection and modification of model outputs. We evaluate our
approach using ground-truth data from a recent SLR comprising over 8,000
candidate papers, benchmarking both open and commercial state-of-the-art LLMs
from mid-2024 and fall 2025. Results demonstrate that our pipeline
significantly reduces manual effort while achieving lower error rates than
single human annotators. Furthermore, modern open-source models prove
sufficient for this task, making the method accessible and cost-effective.
Overall, our work demonstrates how responsible human-AI collaboration can
accelerate and enhance systematic literature reviews within academic workflows.

TL;DR: WearECG使用变分自编码器从三个导联（II、V1、V5）重建十二导联心电图，通过改进的架构捕捉时空依赖关系，生成的心电图在临床有效性和下游诊断任务中表现良好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 十二导联心电图是心脏诊断的黄金标准，但便携性差；三导联系统虽便携但无法检测未测量区域的病理。需要一种方法能从有限的导联重建完整心电图。

Method: 提出WearECG方法，使用变分自编码器从三个导联（II、V1、V5）重建十二导联心电图，包含改进的架构以更好地捕捉ECG信号的时空依赖关系。

Result: 在MIMIC数据集上的实验显示，该方法生成生理真实且诊断信息丰富的信号，在下游任务中表现稳健，通过专家图灵测试和ECGFounder模型验证了临床有效性。

Conclusion: 这项工作展示了生成模型在心电图重建中的潜力，对可扩展、低成本的心脏筛查具有重要意义。

Abstract: Twelve-lead electrocardiograms (ECGs) are the clinical gold standard for
cardiac diagnosis, providing comprehensive spatial coverage of the heart
necessary to detect conditions such as myocardial infarction (MI). However,
their lack of portability limits continuous and large-scale use. Three-lead ECG
systems are widely used in wearable devices due to their simplicity and
mobility, but they often fail to capture pathologies in unmeasured regions. To
address this, we propose WearECG, a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) method that
reconstructs twelve-lead ECGs from three leads: II, V1, and V5. Our model
includes architectural improvements to better capture temporal and spatial
dependencies in ECG signals. We evaluate generation quality using MSE, MAE, and
Frechet Inception Distance (FID), and assess clinical validity via a Turing
test with expert cardiologists. To further validate diagnostic utility, we
fine-tune ECGFounder, a large-scale pretrained ECG model, on a multi-label
classification task involving over 40 cardiac conditions, including six
different myocardial infarction locations, using both real and generated
signals. Experiments on the MIMIC dataset show that our method produces
physiologically realistic and diagnostically informative signals, with robust
performance in downstream tasks. This work demonstrates the potential of
generative modeling for ECG reconstruction and its implications for scalable,
low-cost cardiac screening.

Conclusion: 迭代摊销推理方法通过将基于优化的元学习与LLMs等模型中的前向传递摊销相结合，为通用任务适应提供了可扩展和可扩展的基础。

Abstract: Modern learning systems increasingly rely on amortized learning - the idea of
reusing computation or inductive biases shared across tasks to enable rapid
generalization to novel problems. This principle spans a range of approaches,
including meta-learning, in-context learning, prompt tuning, learned optimizers
and more. While motivated by similar goals, these approaches differ in how they
encode and leverage task-specific information, often provided as in-context
examples. In this work, we propose a unified framework which describes how such
methods differ primarily in the aspects of learning they amortize - such as
initializations, learned updates, or predictive mappings - and how they
incorporate task data at inference. We introduce a taxonomy that categorizes
amortized models into parametric, implicit, and explicit regimes, based on
whether task adaptation is externalized, internalized, or jointly modeled.
Building on this view, we identify a key limitation in current approaches: most
methods struggle to scale to large datasets because their capacity to process
task data at inference (e.g., context length) is often limited. To address
this, we propose iterative amortized inference, a class of models that refine
solutions step-by-step over mini-batches, drawing inspiration from stochastic
optimization. Our formulation bridges optimization-based meta-learning with
forward-pass amortization in models like LLMs, offering a scalable and
extensible foundation for general-purpose task adaptation.

TL;DR: 提出了DFTopK，一种新颖的可微分Top-K算子，实现了最优的O(n)时间复杂度，避免了基于排序的方法中的梯度冲突问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 级联排序在大规模信息检索系统中广泛采用，但Top-K算子不可微分，阻碍端到端训练。现有方法存在目标不一致或梯度冲突问题

Method: 通过放松归一化约束，DFTopK获得闭式解并避免排序，直接构建Top-K选择算子的可微分近似

Result: 在RecFLow基准和工业系统上的实验表明，DFTopK显著提高训练效率并实现更优性能，在线A/B测试带来+1.77%收入提升

Conclusion: 这是首个将可微分Top-K算子引入推荐系统的工作，也是首个实现理论上最优线性时间复杂度的Top-K选择方法

Abstract: Cascade ranking is a widely adopted paradigm in large-scale information
retrieval systems for Top-K item selection. However, the Top-K operator is
non-differentiable, hindering end-to-end training. Existing methods include
Learning-to-Rank approaches (e.g., LambdaLoss), which optimize ranking metrics
like NDCG and suffer from objective misalignment, and differentiable
sorting-based methods (e.g., ARF, LCRON), which relax permutation matrices for
direct Top-K optimization but introduce gradient conflicts through matrix
aggregation. A promising alternative is to directly construct a differentiable
approximation of the Top-K selection operator, bypassing the use of soft
permutation matrices. However, even state-of-the-art differentiable Top-K
operator (e.g., LapSum) require $O(n \log n)$ complexity due to their
dependence on sorting for solving the threshold. Thus, we propose DFTopK, a
novel differentiable Top-K operator achieving optimal $O(n)$ time complexity.
By relaxing normalization constraints, DFTopK admits a closed-form solution and
avoids sorting. DFTopK also avoids the gradient conflicts inherent in
differentiable sorting-based methods. We evaluate DFTopK on both the public
benchmark RecFLow and an industrial system. Experimental results show that
DFTopK significantly improves training efficiency while achieving superior
performance, which enables us to scale up training samples more efficiently. In
the online A/B test, DFTopK yielded a +1.77\% revenue lift with the same
computational budget compared to the baseline. To the best of our knowledge,
this work is the first to introduce differentiable Top-K operators into
recommendation systems and the first to achieve theoretically optimal
linear-time complexity for Top-K selection. We have open-sourced our
implementation to facilitate future research in both academia and industry.

Result: 理论证明当长序列在数据中占比不是指数级小时，强化学习能够高效学习奇偶性预测任务。实验验证了强化学习能够利用更长的测试时计算（表现为更长的响应）来促进学习过程。

Conclusion: 强化学习在下一词预测基础上能够显著提升模型在复杂推理任务上的性能，特别是在处理需要长推理链的任务时，这种训练范式具有理论上的优势。

Abstract: Recent advances in reasoning domains with neural networks have primarily been
enabled by a training recipe that optimizes Large Language Models, previously
trained to predict the next-token in a sequence, with reinforcement learning
algorithms. We introduce a framework to study the success of this paradigm, and
we theoretically expose the optimization mechanisms by which reinforcement
learning improves over next-token prediction in this setting. We study learning
from mixture distributions of short and long ``chain-of-thought'' sequences
encoding a single task. In particular, when the task consists of predicting the
parity of $d$ bits and long sequences are rare, we show how reinforcement
learning after next-token prediction enables autoregressive transformers to
generalize, whereas mere next-token prediction requires extreme statistical or
computational resources to do so. We further explain how reinforcement learning
leverages increased test-time computation, manifested in longer responses, to
facilitate this learning process. In a simplified setting, we theoretically
prove that autoregressive linear models following this training recipe can
efficiently learn to predict the parity of $d$ bits as long as the proportion
of long demonstrations in the data mix is not exponentially small in the input
dimension $d$. Finally, we demonstrate these same phenomena in other settings,
including the post-training of Llama-series models on mixture variations of
common mathematical reasoning benchmarks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在算法代码生成方面表现出色，但在前端开发中表现不佳，因为前端代码的正确性需要通过渲染像素和交互来判断。

Method: 使用多模态大语言模型作为视觉批评家，通过强化学习框架建立生成-诊断-优化循环，引入强制优化规则确保单调改进，并在推理时解耦批评家以降低延迟。

Result: 在三个广泛使用的基准测试中，ReLook始终优于强基线方法，在基于视觉的前端代码生成方面表现突出。

Conclusion: ReLook展示了代理感知、视觉奖励以及训练-推理解耦在前端代码生成中的显著优势。

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at algorithmic code generation, they
struggle with front-end development, where correctness is judged on rendered
pixels and interaction. We present ReLook, an agentic, vision-grounded
reinforcement learning framework that empowers an agent to close a robust
generate--diagnose--refine loop by invoking a multimodal LLM (MLLM) as a tool.
During training, the agent uses the MLLM-in-the-loop both as a visual
critic--scoring code with screenshots--and as a source of actionable,
vision-grounded feedback; a strict zero-reward rule for invalid renders anchors
renderability and prevents reward hacking. To prevent behavioral collapse, we
introduce Forced Optimization, a strict acceptance rule that admits only
improving revisions, yielding monotonically better trajectories. At inference,
we decouple the critic and run a lightweight, critic-free self-edit cycle,
keeping latency comparable to base decoding while retaining most of the gains.
Across three widely used benchmarks, ReLook consistently outperforms strong
baselines in vision-grounded front-end code generation, highlighting the
benefits of agentic perception, visual rewards, and training-inference
decoupling.

Conclusion: GTPs成功弥合了生成模型在离线强化学习中的效率-性能差距，提供了一种更通用的策略范式。

Abstract: Generative models have emerged as a powerful class of policies for offline
reinforcement learning (RL) due to their ability to capture complex,
multi-modal behaviors. However, existing methods face a stark trade-off: slow,
iterative models like diffusion policies are computationally expensive, while
fast, single-step models like consistency policies often suffer from degraded
performance. In this paper, we demonstrate that it is possible to bridge this
gap. The key to moving beyond the limitations of individual methods, we argue,
lies in a unifying perspective that views modern generative models, including
diffusion, flow matching, and consistency models, as specific instances of
learning a continuous-time generative trajectory governed by an Ordinary
Differential Equation (ODE). This principled foundation provides a clearer
design space for generative policies in RL and allows us to propose Generative
Trajectory Policies (GTPs), a new and more general policy paradigm that learns
the entire solution map of the underlying ODE. To make this paradigm practical
for offline RL, we further introduce two key theoretically principled
adaptations. Empirical results demonstrate that GTP achieves state-of-the-art
performance on D4RL benchmarks - it significantly outperforms prior generative
policies, achieving perfect scores on several notoriously hard AntMaze tasks.

Abstract: Autonomous vehicles have shown promising potential to be a groundbreaking
technology for improving the safety of road users. For these vehicles, as well
as many other safety-critical robotic technologies, to be deployed in
real-world applications, we require algorithms that can generalize well to
unseen scenarios and data. Model-based reinforcement learning algorithms (MBRL)
have demonstrated state-of-the-art performance and data efficiency across a
diverse set of domains. However, these algorithms have also shown
susceptibility to changes in the environment and its transition dynamics.
  In this work, we explore the performance and generalization capabilities of
MBRL algorithms for autonomous driving, specifically in the simulated
autonomous racing environment, Roboracer (formerly F1Tenth). We frame the
head-to-head racing task as a learning problem using contextual Markov decision
processes and parameterize the driving behavior of the adversaries using the
context of the episode, thereby also parameterizing the transition and reward
dynamics. We benchmark the behavior of MBRL algorithms in this environment and
propose a novel context-aware extension of the existing literature, cMask. We
demonstrate that context-aware MBRL algorithms generalize better to
out-of-distribution adversary behaviors relative to context-free approaches. We
also demonstrate that cMask displays strong generalization capabilities, as
well as further performance improvement relative to other context-aware MBRL
approaches when racing against adversaries with in-distribution behaviors.

Abstract: Research on reasoning in language models (LMs) predominantly focuses on
improving the correctness of their outputs. But some important applications
require modeling reasoning patterns that are incorrect. For example, automated
systems that can reason about and simulate student errors are useful for
providing real-time feedback in the classroom or offline practice for
educators-in-training. This paper presents a new method, MISTAKE, that (1)
constructs high-quality synthetic examples of reasoning errors by leveraging
cycle consistency between incorrect answers and latent misconceptions; and (2)
uses the generated data to learn models for student simulation, misconception
classification, and answer generation. We evaluate MISTAKE on three educational
tasks and find that it results in (1) higher accuracy when simulating incorrect
student answers based on specific misconceptions, (2) increased performance
inferring latent misconceptions from observed incorrect answers, and (3) higher
alignment with expert-written distractor answers when generating incorrect
answers (e.g., for multiple-choice tests).

Abstract: Evapotranspiration (ET) plays a critical role in the land-atmosphere
interactions, yet its accurate quantification across various spatiotemporal
scales remains a challenge. In situ measurement approaches, like eddy
covariance (EC) or weather station-based ET estimation, allow for measuring ET
at a single location. Agricultural uses of ET require estimates for each field
over broad areas, making it infeasible to deploy sensing systems at each
location. This study integrates tree-based and knowledge-guided machine
learning (ML) techniques with multispectral remote sensing data, griddled
meteorology and EC data to upscale ET across the Midwest United States. We
compare four tree-based models - Random Forest, CatBoost, XGBoost, LightGBM -
and a simple feed-forward artificial neural network in combination with
features engineered using knowledge-guided ML principles. Models were trained
and tested on EC towers located in the Midwest of the United States using
k-fold cross validation with k=5 and site-year, biome stratified train-test
split to avoid data leakage. Results show that LightGBM with knowledge-guided
features outperformed other methods with an R2=0.86, MSE=14.99 W m^-2 and MAE =
8.82 W m^-2 according to grouped k-fold validation (k=5). Feature importance
analysis shows that knowledge-guided features were most important for
predicting evapotranspiration. Using the best performing model, we provide a
data product at 500 m spatial and one-day temporal resolution for gridded ET
for the period of 2019-2024. Intercomparison between the new gridded product
and state-level weather station-based ET estimates show best-in-class
correspondence.

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has demonstrated its ability to enhance
Large Language Models (LLMs) by integrating external knowledge sources.
However, multi-hop questions, which require the identification of multiple
knowledge targets to form a synthesized answer, raise new challenges for RAG
systems. Under the multi-hop settings, existing methods often struggle to fully
understand the questions with complex semantic structures and are susceptible
to irrelevant noise during the retrieval of multiple information targets. To
address these limitations, we propose a novel graph representation learning
framework for multi-hop question retrieval. We first introduce a
Multi-information Level Knowledge Graph (Multi-L KG) to model various
information levels for a more comprehensive understanding of multi-hop
questions. Based on this, we design a Query-Specific Graph Neural Network
(QSGNN) for representation learning on the Multi-L KG. QSGNN employs
intra/inter-level message passing mechanisms, and in each message passing the
information aggregation is guided by the query, which not only facilitates
multi-granular information aggregation but also significantly reduces the
impact of noise. To enhance its ability to learn robust representations, we

*Zihao Zhao,Christopher Yeh,Lingkai Kong,Kai Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了首个基于扩散模型的决策聚焦学习方法，通过训练扩散模型来表示不确定参数的分布，并使用扩散模型采样进行随机优化，在决策质量上优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的决策聚焦学习方法通常依赖确定性点预测，无法充分捕捉现实环境中的内在随机性，因此需要能够处理不确定性的新方法。

Method: 提出了两种扩散DFL方法：1）使用重参数化技巧的端到端训练方法；2）轻量级评分函数估计器，仅需几个前向扩散过程，避免采样过程中的反向传播。

Result: 实证研究表明，扩散DFL方法在决策质量上始终优于强基线方法。

Conclusion: 扩散模型为决策聚焦学习提供了处理不确定性的有效框架，提出的轻量级方法在保持性能的同时显著降低了计算成本。

Abstract: Decision-focused learning (DFL) integrates predictive modeling and
optimization by training predictors to optimize the downstream decision target
rather than merely minimizing prediction error. To date, existing DFL methods
typically rely on deterministic point predictions, which are often insufficient
to capture the intrinsic stochasticity of real-world environments. To address
this challenge, we propose the first diffusion-based DFL approach, which trains
a diffusion model to represent the distribution of uncertain parameters and
optimizes the decision by solving a stochastic optimization with samples drawn
from the diffusion model. Our contributions are twofold. First, we formulate
diffusion DFL using the reparameterization trick, enabling end-to-end training
through diffusion. While effective, it is memory and compute-intensive due to
the need to differentiate through the diffusion sampling process. Second, we
propose a lightweight score function estimator that uses only several forward
diffusion passes and avoids backpropagation through the sampling. This follows
from our results that backpropagating through stochastic optimization can be
approximated by a weighted score function formulation. We empirically show that
our diffusion DFL approach consistently outperforms strong baselines in
decision quality. The source code for all experiments is available at the
project repository: https://github.com/GT-KOALA/Diffusion_DFL.

TL;DR: 提出了一种联合学习注意力因子和套利交易策略的框架，在考虑交易成本后实现高夏普比率的统计套利。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统统计套利方法未能联合优化因子识别和交易策略，无法在交易成本约束下最大化风险调整后收益。

Method: 开发注意力因子作为条件潜在因子，从公司特征嵌入中学习复杂交互，使用序列模型识别残差组合中的时间序列信号，并联合估计因子和交易策略。

Result: 在24年美国最大股票上的回测显示，注意力因子模型获得超过4的样本外夏普比率，考虑交易成本后夏普比率达到2.3。

Conclusion: 联合优化因子和交易策略对最大化交易成本后的盈利能力至关重要，弱因子在套利交易中具有重要作用。

Abstract: Statistical arbitrage exploits temporal price differences between similar
assets. We develop a framework to jointly identify similar assets through
factors, identify mispricing and form a trading policy that maximizes
risk-adjusted performance after trading costs. Our Attention Factors are
conditional latent factors that are the most useful for arbitrage trading. They
are learned from firm characteristic embeddings that allow for complex
interactions. We identify time-series signals from the residual portfolios of
our factors with a general sequence model. Estimating factors and the arbitrage
trading strategy jointly is crucial to maximize profitability after trading
costs. In a comprehensive empirical study we show that our Attention Factor
model achieves an out-of-sample Sharpe ratio above 4 on the largest U.S.
equities over a 24-year period. Our one-step solution yields an unprecedented
Sharpe ratio of 2.3 net of transaction costs. We show that weak factors are
important for arbitrage trading.

*Prasanna Mayilvahanan,Ricardo Dominguez-Olmedo,Thaddäus Wiedemer,Wieland Brendel*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文指出当前强化学习微调方法在数学推理上主要是在优化现有解题模式而非发现新方法，为此提出了MATH-B基准测试来挑战现有模型，促进真正探索性强化学习方法的发展。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有强化学习方法在数学推理任务上存在局限，虽然DeepSeek-R1等模型表现出色，但通过大量采样发现基础模型已经能解决大多数标准数学问题，强化学习微调只是优化已有能力而非创造新推理方式。

Method: 构建了MATH-B基准测试，该基准专门设计用于挑战参数规模达8B的开源模型，即使在大规模采样下也难以解决。问题来源于DAPO-Math-17K和DeepScaleR数据集，保持与高中数学主题一致但难度更高。

Result: 验证了现有强化学习微调模型（如Nemotron-Research-Reasoning-Qwen-1.5B和DeepScaleR-1.5B-Preview）在MATH-B基准上表现不佳，即使在pass@1024的大规模采样下也无法有效解决这些问题。

Conclusion: MATH-B基准揭示了当前强化学习方法在数学推理上的局限性，需要开发真正能够探索新推理方式的强化学习方法，而不仅仅是优化现有能力。

Abstract: With the advent of DeepSeek-R1, a new wave of reinforcement learning (RL)
methods has emerged that seem to unlock stronger mathematical reasoning.
However, a closer look at the open-source ecosystem reveals a critical
limitation: with sufficiently many draws (e.g., $\texttt{pass@1024}$), many
existing base models already solve nearly all questions on widely used math
benchmarks such as MATH-500 and AIME 2024. This suggests that the RL
fine-tuning methods prevalent in the LLM reasoning literature largely sharpen
existing solution modes rather than discovering entirely new ones. Such
sharpening stands in contrast to the broader promise of RL: to foster
exploration and to acquire new skills. To move beyond this plateau, we
introduce MATH-Beyond (MATH-B), a benchmark deliberately constructed to defeat
common open-source models of up to 8B parameters even under large sampling
budgets. Improving performance on our benchmark via RL requires methods that
learn to reason in ways that go beyond base model capabilities in repeated
sampling. Since the problems are drawn from subsets of DAPO-Math-17K and
DeepScaleR datasets, they remain topically equivalent to standard high-school
math. Validating our premise, RL fine-tuned models such as
Nemotron-Research-Reasoning-Qwen-1.5B and DeepScaleR-1.5B-Preview perform
poorly on MATH-B at $\texttt{pass@1024}$, showing how existing approaches fall
short on tackling harder instances. We hope MATH-B will catalyze
exploration-driven RL approaches that elicit deeper reasoning capabilities. We
release MATH-B at https://huggingface.co/datasets/brendel-group/MATH-Beyond.

TL;DR: 本文研究了动态测度传输在生成建模中的应用，特别关注由连接源分布和目标分布的随机过程诱导的流。研究发现，当条件加速度与加权协方差张量的散度达到平衡时，会产生直线流（点加速度为零），这种流可以用一阶方法精确积分。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究随机过程诱导的流在生成建模中的应用，探索哪些过程能产生直线流（点加速度为零），从而简化积分过程并提高计算效率。

Method: 通过PDE分析表征直线性条件，证明直线流发生在确定性端点耦合情况下，并推导出约束流几何的必要条件。

Result: 完全刻画了仿射时间插值，发现直线性仅在确定性端点耦合时发生，并提供了设计更易积分传输的通用指导原则。

Conclusion: 研究为设计更易积分的传输过程提供了理论基础，特别强调了确定性端点耦合在产生直线流中的关键作用。

Abstract: We study dynamic measure transport for generative modeling: specifically,
flows induced by stochastic processes that bridge a specified source and target
distribution. The conditional expectation of the process' velocity defines an
ODE whose flow map achieves the desired transport. We ask \emph{which processes
produce straight-line flows} -- i.e., flows whose pointwise acceleration
vanishes and thus are exactly integrable with a first-order method? We provide
a concise PDE characterization of straightness as a balance between conditional
acceleration and the divergence of a weighted covariance (Reynolds) tensor.
Using this lens, we fully characterize affine-in-time interpolants and show
that straightness occurs exactly under deterministic endpoint couplings. We
also derive necessary conditions that constrain flow geometry for general
processes, offering broad guidance for designing transports that are easier to
integrate.

Conclusion: 该框架为研究人员提供了一个简单易用、可复现且无前瞻偏差的预测工具，有效隔离了训练数据泄露的影响。

Abstract: We introduce a family of chronologically consistent, instruction-following
large language models to eliminate lookahead bias. Each model is trained only
on data available before a clearly defined knowledge-cutoff date, ensuring
strict temporal separation from any post-cutoff data. The resulting framework
offers (i) a simple, conversational chat interface, (ii) fully open, fixed
model weights that guarantee replicability, and (iii) a conservative lower
bound on forecast accuracy, isolating the share of predictability that survives
once training leakage is removed. Together, these features provide researchers
with an easy-to-use generative AI tool useful for a wide range of prediction
tasks that is free of lookahead bias.

TL;DR: 提出了BGPO算法，通过构建特殊的ELBO下界来解决dLLMs中RL训练的内存瓶颈问题，实现了线性梯度和恒定内存使用，显著提升了数学问题解决、代码生成和规划任务的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在dLLMs的RL训练中，由于需要保留所有MC样本的前向计算图来计算非线性项的梯度，导致内存开销巨大，限制了样本数量，从而影响似然估计精度和RL目标。

Method: 提出Boundary-Guided Policy Optimization (BGPO)，构建满足线性和等价性两个关键特性的ELBO下界，实现跨样本的梯度累积和恒定内存使用。

Result: 实验表明BGPO在数学问题解决、代码生成和规划任务中显著优于之前的RL算法。

Conclusion: BGPO通过内存高效的算法设计，解决了dLLMs中RL训练的内存瓶颈，实现了更准确的似然估计和更好的性能表现。

Abstract: A key challenge in applying reinforcement learning (RL) to diffusion large
language models (dLLMs) lies in the intractability of their likelihood
functions, which are essential for the RL objective, necessitating
corresponding approximation in each training step. While existing methods
approximate the log-likelihoods by their evidence lower bounds (ELBOs) via
customized Monte Carlo (MC) sampling, the forward computational graphs of all
MC samples need to be retained for the gradient computation of non-linear terms
in the RL objective, resulting in significant memory overhead. This constraint
restricts feasible sample sizes, leading to imprecise likelihood approximations
and ultimately distorting the RL objective. To overcome this limitation, we
propose \emph{Boundary-Guided Policy Optimization} (BGPO), a memory-efficient
RL algorithm that maximizes a specially constructed lower bound of the
ELBO-based objective. This lower bound is carefully designed to satisfy two key
properties: (1) Linearity: it is formulated in a linear sum where each term
depends only on a single MC sample, thereby enabling gradient accumulation
across samples and ensuring constant memory usage; (2) Equivalence: Both the
value and gradient of this lower bound are equal to those of the ELBO-based
objective in on-policy training, making it also an effective approximation for
the original RL objective. These properties allow BGPO to adopt a large MC
sample size, resulting in more accurate likelihood approximations and improved
RL objective estimation, which in turn leads to enhanced performance.
Experiments show that BGPO significantly outperforms previous RL algorithms for
dLLMs in math problem solving, code generation, and planning tasks.

TL;DR: 本文研究了在语言模型强化学习中通过基于预训练模型隐藏状态的表示多样性奖励来促进探索，显著提高了推理任务的多样性和pass@k率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究当前RL技术是否真正促进新行为的发现，还是仅仅优化已有行为，研究预训练模型知识如何指导探索过程。

Method: 使用基于预训练语言模型隐藏状态的表示多样性奖励来激励模型发现新颖多样的行为，应用于后训练和推理时扩展设置。

Result: 表示多样性探索显著提高了多样性和pass@k率：推理时在多种模型和推理任务上一致提升pass@k率，后训练中集成到RL流程提升了推理性能。

Conclusion: 精心设计的探索策略（特别是基于适当多样性概念的探索）是超越简单优化的实用路径，能够发现新行为。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) promises to expand the capabilities of language
models, but it is unclear if current RL techniques promote the discovery of
novel behaviors, or simply sharpen those already present in the base model. In
this paper, we investigate the value of deliberate exploration -- explicitly
incentivizing the model to discover novel and diverse behaviors -- and aim to
understand how the knowledge in pre-trained models can guide this search. Our
main finding is that exploration with a simple, principled,
representation-based bonus derived from the pre-trained language model's hidden
states significantly improves diversity and pass@k rates -- both for
post-training, and in a novel inference-time scaling setting we introduce. For
inference-time, exploration with representation-based diversity improves
efficiency, consistently improving pass@k rates across a variety of models and
reasoning tasks. For example, for Qwen-2.5-14b-Instruct we obtain over 50%
improvement in verifier efficiency on almost all tasks. For post-training, we
show that integrating this exploration strategy into an RL pipeline improves
reasoning performance over that of the initial model and over standard RL
post-training. For example, on AIME 2024, our post-trained
Qwen-2.5-7b-Instruct's pass@80 matches the pass@256 of GRPO on the same model,
demonstrating a 3x improvement in test-time sample efficiency. Overall, our
findings suggest that deliberate exploration -- with the right notion of
diversity -- is a practical path toward discovery of new behaviors beyond
sharpening.

TL;DR: 本文研究了乐观Hedge算法在二人零和博弈中的遗憾最优性，改进了社交和个体遗憾上界至O(√(log m log n))，并证明了这些上界无法进一步改进，包括常数因子匹配。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究乐观Hedge算法在强非耦合学习动态中的遗憾依赖m和n的最优性，现有O(log(mn))遗憾界是否可改进。

Method: 通过将遗憾上界表达为关于学习率和负项系数的优化问题，进行精细分析；提供算法依赖的个体遗憾下界证明最优性。

Result: 在已知对手动作数的情况下，社交和个体遗憾上界改进为O(√(log m log n))；证明了这些上界包括常数因子都是最优的。

Conclusion: 乐观Hedge的社交和个体遗憾界已达到最优，基于这些结果还改进了最后迭代收敛率和动态遗憾界。

Abstract: In two-player zero-sum games, the learning dynamic based on optimistic Hedge
achieves one of the best-known regret upper bounds among strongly-uncoupled
learning dynamics. With an appropriately chosen learning rate, the social and
individual regrets can be bounded by $O(\log(mn))$ in terms of the numbers of
actions $m$ and $n$ of the two players. This study investigates the optimality
of the dependence on $m$ and $n$ in the regret of optimistic Hedge. To this
end, we begin by refining existing regret analysis and show that, in the
strongly-uncoupled setting where the opponent's number of actions is known,
both the social and individual regret bounds can be improved to $O(\sqrt{\log m
\log n})$. In this analysis, we express the regret upper bound as an
optimization problem with respect to the learning rates and the coefficients of
certain negative terms, enabling refined analysis of the leading constants. We
then show that the existing social regret bound as well as these new social and
individual regret upper bounds cannot be further improved for optimistic Hedge
by providing algorithm-dependent individual regret lower bounds. Importantly,
these social regret upper and lower bounds match exactly including the constant
factor in the leading term. Finally, building on these results, we improve the
last-iterate convergence rate and the dynamic regret of a learning dynamic
based on optimistic Hedge, and complement these bounds with algorithm-dependent
dynamic regret lower bounds that match the improved bounds.

TL;DR: QeRL是一个量化增强的强化学习框架，通过结合NVFP4量化和LoRA技术，加速LLM的强化学习训练过程，减少内存开销，并利用量化噪声增强探索能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLM强化学习训练资源密集、GPU内存需求大、训练时间长的问题，同时利用量化噪声来增强策略探索。

Method: 结合NVFP4量化和低秩适应(LoRA)技术，引入自适应量化噪声(AQN)机制动态调整训练过程中的噪声水平。

Result: 在rollout阶段实现1.5倍加速，首次在单张H100 80GB GPU上训练32B LLM，在数学基准测试GSM8K(90.8%)和MATH 500(77.4%)上达到全参数微调性能。

Conclusion: QeRL是一个高效有效的LLM强化学习训练框架，在保持性能的同时显著提升了训练效率和资源利用率。

Abstract: We propose QeRL, a Quantization-enhanced Reinforcement Learning framework for
large language models (LLMs). While RL is essential for LLMs' reasoning
capabilities, it is resource-intensive, requiring substantial GPU memory and
long rollout durations. QeRL addresses these issues by combining NVFP4
quantization with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), accelerating rollout phase of RL
while reducing memory overhead. Beyond efficiency, our findings show that
quantization noise increases policy entropy, enhancing exploration, and
enabling the discovery of better strategies during RL. To further optimize
exploration, QeRL introduces an Adaptive Quantization Noise (AQN) mechanism,
which dynamically adjusts noise during training. Experiments demonstrate that
QeRL delivers over 1.5 times speedup in the rollout phase. Moreover, this is
the first framework to enable RL training of a 32B LLM on a single H100 80GB
GPU, while delivering overall speedups for RL training. It also achieves faster
reward growth and higher final accuracy than 16-bit LoRA and QLoRA, while
matching the performance of full-parameter fine-tuning on mathematical
benchmarks such as GSM8K (90.8%) and MATH 500 (77.4%) in the 7B model. These
results establish QeRL as an efficient and effective framework for RL training
in LLMs.

Motivation: 解决关于对抗性样本起源的根本问题，挑战传统观点（决策边界不规则性或非鲁棒特征敏感性），探索对抗性脆弱性是否源于神经网络的高效信息编码机制。

Method: 通过分析叠加现象（网络表示特征超过维度）对潜在表示排列的影响，在精确控制叠加的合成设置中验证，并在CIFAR-10上训练的ViT模型中进行实证验证。

Result: 证明叠加足以产生对抗性漏洞，对抗性扰动利用叠加特征间的干扰，攻击模式可从特征排列中预测，解释了模型间攻击可迁移性和类特定脆弱性模式。

Conclusion: 对抗性脆弱性是网络表示压缩的副产品，而非学习过程缺陷或非鲁棒输入问题，为理解对抗性样本提供了新的机制性解释框架。

Abstract: Fundamental questions remain about when and why adversarial examples arise in
neural networks, with competing views characterising them either as artifacts
of the irregularities in the decision landscape or as products of sensitivity
to non-robust input features. In this paper, we instead argue that adversarial
vulnerability can stem from efficient information encoding in neural networks.
Specifically, we show how superposition - where networks represent more
features than they have dimensions - creates arrangements of latent
representations that adversaries can exploit. We demonstrate that adversarial
perturbations leverage interference between superposed features, making attack
patterns predictable from feature arrangements. Our framework provides a
mechanistic explanation for two known phenomena: adversarial attack
transferability between models with similar training regimes and class-specific
vulnerability patterns. In synthetic settings with precisely controlled
superposition, we establish that superposition suffices to create adversarial
vulnerability. We then demonstrate that these findings persist in a ViT trained
on CIFAR-10. These findings reveal adversarial vulnerability can be a byproduct
of networks' representational compression, rather than flaws in the learning
process or non-robust inputs.

Conclusion: 该方法成功结合了摊销采样和粒子方法的优势，为复杂分布采样提供了更稳定有效的解决方案。

Abstract: This paper proposes a synergy of amortised and particle-based methods for
sampling from distributions defined by unnormalised density functions. We state
a connection between sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) and neural sequential
samplers trained by maximum-entropy reinforcement learning (MaxEnt RL), wherein
learnt sampling policies and value functions define proposal kernels and twist
functions. Exploiting this connection, we introduce an off-policy RL training
procedure for the sampler that uses samples from SMC -- using the learnt
sampler as a proposal -- as a behaviour policy that better explores the target
distribution. We describe techniques for stable joint training of proposals and
twist functions and an adaptive weight tempering scheme to reduce training
signal variance. Furthermore, building upon past attempts to use experience
replay to guide the training of neural samplers, we derive a way to combine
historical samples with annealed importance sampling weights within a replay
buffer. On synthetic multi-modal targets (in both continuous and discrete
spaces) and the Boltzmann distribution of alanine dipeptide conformations, we
demonstrate improvements in approximating the true distribution as well as
training stability compared to both amortised and Monte Carlo methods.

Abstract: Functional verification is a critical bottleneck in integrated circuit
development, with CPU verification being especially time-intensive and
labour-consuming. Industrial practice relies on differential testing for CPU
verification, yet faces bottlenecks at nearly each stage of the framework
pipeline: front-end stimulus generation lacks micro-architectural awareness,
yielding low-quality and redundant tests that impede coverage closure and miss
corner cases. Meanwhile, back-end simulation infrastructure, even with FPGA
acceleration, often stalls on long-running tests and offers limited visibility,
delaying feedback and prolonging the debugging cycle. Here, we present ISAAC, a
full-stack, Large Language Model (LLM)-aided CPU verification framework with
FPGA parallelism, from bug categorisation and stimulus generation to simulation
infrastructure. To do so, we presented a multi-agent stimulus engine in ISAAC's
front-end, infused with micro-architectural knowledge and historical bug
patterns, generating highly targeted tests that rapidly achieve coverage goals
and capture elusive corner cases. In ISAAC's back-end, we introduce a
lightweight forward-snapshot mechanism and a decoupled co-simulation
architecture between the Instruction Set Simulator (ISS) and the Design Under
Test (DUT), enabling a single ISS to drive multiple DUTs in parallel. By
eliminating long-tail test bottlenecks and exploiting FPGA parallelism, the
simulation throughput is significantly improved. As a demonstration, we used
ISAAC to verify a mature CPU that has undergone multiple successful tape-outs.
Results show up to 17,536x speed-up over software RTL simulation, while
detecting several previously unknown bugs, two of which are reported in this
paper.

Conclusion: ADiP架构通过自适应精度和灵活的计算模式，显著提升了矩阵乘法的效率和能效，特别适用于Transformer等现代AI工作负载的加速需求。

Abstract: Transformers are at the core of modern AI nowadays. They rely heavily on
matrix multiplication and require efficient acceleration due to their
substantial memory and computational requirements. Quantization plays a vital
role in reducing memory usage, and can be exploited for computations by
designing reconfigurable architectures that enhance matrix multiplication by
dynamically adjusting the precision. This paper proposes ADiP, a novel
adaptive-precision systolic array architecture designed for efficient matrix
multiplication acceleration.The proposed architecture consists of NxN
adaptive-precision processing elements (PEs) and shared accumulators. ADiP
supports multiple computation modes, including symmetric single-matrix
multiplication as well as asymmetric multi-matrix multiplication with a shared
input matrix, thereby improving data-reuse and PE utilization. In addition,
ADiP maximizes the computational density by adapting to different precisions,
such as 8bitx8bit, 8bitx4bit, and 8bitx2bit. Analytical models are developed
for ADiP architecture, including latency and throughput for versatile
architecture configurations. A comprehensive hardware design space exploration
is demonstrated using 22nm commercial technology, achieving up to a 4x higher
computational throughput. Furthermore, ADiP is evaluated on different
transformer workloads from GPT-2 Medium, BERT Large, and BitNet-1.58B models,
delivering latency improvement up to 53.6%, and energy improvement up to 24.4%
for BitNet-1.58B MHA workloads. At a 64x64 size with 4096 PEs, ADiP achieves a
peak throughput of 8.192 TOPS, 16.384 TOPS, and 32.768 TOPS for 8bitx8bit,
8bitx4bit, and 8bitx2bit operations, respectively.

Motivation: 质谱数据量快速增长（已达数百TB级别），传统处理器难以高效处理大规模库搜索任务，存内计算成为有前景的替代方案。

Method: 结合3D铁电NAND存储器（提供更高密度、更快速度和更低电压）与超维计算（支持高度并行处理和强容错性），并采用双边界近似匹配距离度量来适配FeNAND结构。

Result: 实现了43倍速度提升和21倍能效提升，同时保持了与现有方法相当的准确率。

Conclusion: 该存内计算架构成功解决了大规模质谱库搜索的效率和能耗问题，为药物发现等应用提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: The rapid expansion of mass spectrometry (MS) data, now exceeding hundreds of
terabytes, poses significant challenges for efficient, large-scale library
search - a critical component for drug discovery. Traditional processors
struggle to handle this data volume efficiently, making in-storage computing
(ISP) a promising alternative. This work introduces an ISP architecture
leveraging a 3D Ferroelectric NAND (FeNAND) structure, providing significantly
higher density, faster speeds, and lower voltage requirements compared to
traditional NAND flash. Despite its superior density, the NAND structure has
not been widely utilized in ISP applications due to limited throughput
associated with row-by-row reads from serially connected cells. To overcome
these limitations, we integrate hyperdimensional computing (HDC), a
brain-inspired paradigm that enables highly parallel processing with simple
operations and strong error tolerance. By combining HDC with the proposed
dual-bound approximate matching (D-BAM) distance metric, tailored to the FeNAND
structure, we parallelize vector computations to enable efficient MS spectral
library search, achieving 43x speedup and 21x higher energy efficiency over
state-of-the-art 3D NAND methods, while maintaining comparable accuracy.

Motivation: 解决稀疏矩阵在存内计算阵列上映射效率低的问题，提升稀疏大语言模型在资源受限系统中的推理效率

Method: 开发自动化框架，采用创新的映射和调度策略，利用块对角稀疏性优化存内计算阵列的利用率

Result: 存内计算阵列利用率提高超过50%，内存占用和浮点运算次数均减少4倍以上

Conclusion: 该框架有效解决了稀疏矩阵在存内计算架构上的映射效率问题，显著提升了稀疏大语言模型的推理性能

Abstract: Structured sparsity enables deploying large language models (LLMs) on
resource-constrained systems. Approaches like dense-to-sparse fine-tuning are
particularly compelling, achieving remarkable structured sparsity by reducing
the model size by over 6.7x, while still maintaining acceptable accuracy.
Despite this reduction, LLM inference, especially the decode stage being
inherently memory-bound, is extremely expensive on conventional Von-Neumann
architectures. Compute-in-memory (CIM) architectures mitigate this by
performing computations directly in memory, and when paired with sparse LLMs,
enable storing and computing the entire model in memory, eliminating the data
movement on the off-chip bus and improving efficiency. Nonetheless, naively
mapping sparse matrices onto CIM arrays leads to poor array utilization and
diminished computational efficiency. In this paper, we present an automated
framework with novel mapping and scheduling strategies to accelerate sparse LLM
inference on CIM accelerators. By exploiting block-diagonal sparsity, our
approach improves CIM array utilization by over 50%, achieving more than 4x
reduction in both memory footprint and the number of required floating-point
operations.

Motivation: 传统CPU模拟器如GEM5采用周期精确和事件驱动方法，模拟现代多核CPU的微架构行为非常耗时。现有的机器学习方法仅限于估计基本块的周期，无法预测完整基准测试程序的执行时间。

Method: 使用基于注意力的神经网络性能预测器和带上下文注释的指令轨迹采样方法。注意力机制有效捕捉指令轨迹中的长程影响，强调关键上下文信息，提高预测准确性。

Conclusion: CAPSim通过注意力机制和指令轨迹采样，能够快速准确地预测基准测试程序的执行时间，为CPU架构研究提供了高效的模拟解决方案。

Abstract: CPU simulators are vital for computer architecture research, primarily for
estimating performance under different programs. This poses challenges for fast
and accurate simulation of modern CPUs, especially in multi-core systems.
Modern CPU peformance simulators such as GEM5 adopt the cycle-accurate and
event-driven approach, which is timeconsuming to simulate the extensive
microarchitectural behavior of a real benchmark running on out-of-order CPUs.
Recently, machine leaning based approach has been proposed to improve
simulation speed, but they are currently limited to estimating the cycles of
basic blocks rather than the complete benchmark program. This paper introduces
a novel ML-based CPU simulator named CAPSim, which uses an attention-based
neural network performance predictor and instruction trace sampling method
annotated with context. The attention mechanism effectively captures long-range
influence within the instruction trace, emphasizing critical context
information. This allows the model to improve performance prediction accuracy
by focusing on important code instruction. CAPSim can predict the execution
time of unseen benchmarks at a significantly fast speed compared with an
accurate O3 simulator built with gem5. Our evaluation on a commercial Intel
Xeon CPU demonstrates that CAPSim achieves a 2.2 - 8.3x speedup compared to
using gem5 built simulator, which is superior to the cutting-edge deep learning
approach

TL;DR: QONNECT是一个供应商无关的编排框架，支持在异构Kubernetes和K3s集群上进行声明式、QoS驱动的应用部署，解决了标准Kubernetes调度器无法满足用户定义目标的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代应用越来越多地跨越云、雾和边缘环境，需要能够适应不同部署场景并满足QoS要求的编排系统。标准Kubernetes调度器不考虑用户定义的目标，如能效、成本优化和全局性能，导致操作员需要手动进行逐个集群的部署决策。

Method: QONNECT采用分布式架构，包括中央知识库、Raft复制的资源主导代理和每个集群中的轻量级资源代理。用户通过基于YAML的接口指定高级QoS目标，系统将其转换为具体的部署和迁移操作。

Result: 在最多9个云-雾-边缘集群的联邦测试平台上使用Istio Bookinfo微服务应用进行评估，系统展示了动态、策略驱动的微服务部署、自动故障转移、QoS合规的重新调度以及节点故障后的领导者重新选举，所有这些都无需人工干预。

Conclusion: QONNECT通过弥合声明式部署模型和操作QoS目标之间的差距，将云-边缘连续体转变为统一的、自优化的平台。

Abstract: Modern applications increasingly span across cloud, fog, and edge
environments, demanding orchestration systems that can adapt to diverse
deployment contexts while meeting Quality-of-Service (QoS) requirements.
Standard Kubernetes schedulers do not account for user-defined objectives such
as energy efficiency, cost optimization, and global performance, often leaving
operators to make manual, cluster-by-cluster placement decisions. To address
this need, we present QONNECT, a vendor-agnostic orchestration framework that
enables declarative, QoS-driven application deployment across heterogeneous
Kubernetes and K3s clusters. QONNECT introduces a distributed architecture
composed of a central Knowledge Base, Raft-replicated Resource Lead Agents, and
lightweight Resource Agents in each cluster. Through a minimal YAML-based
interface, users specify high-level QoS goals, which the system translates into
concrete placement and migration actions. Our implementation is evaluated on a
federated testbed of up to nine cloud-fog-edge clusters using the Istio
Bookinfo microservice application. The system demonstrates dynamic,
policy-driven microservice placement, automated failover, QoS-compliant
rescheduling, and leader re-election after node failure, all without manual
intervention. By bridging the gap between declarative deployment models and
operational QoS goals, QONNECT transforms the cloud-edge continuum into a
unified, self-optimizing platform.

Motivation: 传统研究和行业实践普遍认为CPU限制是必要的，但实际云用户经验表明CPU限制会损害应用性能并增加成本，这与传统认知相矛盾

Method: 通过实证证据分析CPU限制对延迟敏感应用的影响，并与传统认知进行对比

Result: 发现CPU限制对延迟敏感应用有害，建议完全避免使用，但承认在某些特定场景（如后台作业）中合理使用CPU限制可能有益

Conclusion: 需要重新思考自动扩展和计费范式，为云原生应用的资源管理开辟新的研究方向

Abstract: Research in compute resource management for cloud-native applications is
dominated by the problem of setting optimal CPU limits -- a fundamental OS
mechanism that strictly restricts a container's CPU usage to its specified
CPU-limits . Rightsizing and autoscaling works have innovated on
allocation/scaling policies assuming the ubiquity and necessity of CPU-limits .
We question this. Practical experiences of cloud users indicate that CPU-limits
harms application performance and costs more than it helps. These observations
are in contradiction to the conventional wisdom presented in both academic
research and industry best practices. We argue that this indiscriminate
adoption of CPU-limits is driven by erroneous beliefs that CPU-limits is
essential for operational and safety purposes. We provide empirical evidence
making a case for eschewing CPU-limits completely from latency-sensitive
applications. This prompts a fundamental rethinking of auto-scaling and billing
paradigms and opens new research avenues. Finally, we highlight specific
scenarios where CPU-limits can be beneficial if used in a well-reasoned way
(e.g. background jobs).

Result: 在三个Kubernetes集群上部署，实现了94%的精确率、91%的召回率和0.92的F1分数，同时相比集中式基线减少了60%的带宽使用。

Conclusion: FedMon通过融合内核级遥测和联邦学习，为大规模多租户云原生环境提供了准确、可扩展且保护隐私的异常检测防御方案。

Abstract: Kubernetes multi-cluster deployments demand scalable and privacy-preserving
anomaly detection. Existing eBPF-based monitors provide low-overhead system and
network visibility but are limited to single clusters, while centralized
approaches incur bandwidth, privacy, and heterogeneity challenges. We propose
FedMon, a federated eBPF framework that unifies kernel-level telemetry with
federated learning (FL) for cross-cluster anomaly detection. Lightweight eBPF
agents capture syscalls and network events, extract local statistical and
sequence features, and share only model updates with a global server. A hybrid
detection engine combining Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) with Isolation
Forests enables both temporal pattern modeling and outlier detection. Deployed
across three Kubernetes clusters, FedMon achieves 94% precision, 91% recall,
and an F1-score of 0.92, while cutting bandwidth usage by 60% relative to
centralized baselines. Results demonstrate that FedMon enhances accuracy,
scalability, and privacy, providing an effective defense for large-scale,
multi-tenant cloud-native environments.

Abstract: Edge computing allows for the decentralization of computing resources. This
decentralization is achieved through implementing microservice architectures,
which require low latencies to meet stringent service level agreements (SLA)
such as performance, reliability, and availability metrics. While cloud
computing offers the large data storage and computation resources necessary to
handle peak demands, a hybrid cloud and edge environment is required to ensure
SLA compliance. Several auto-scaling algorithms have been proposed to try to
achieve these compliance challenges, but they suffer from performance issues
and configuration complexity. This chapter provides a brief overview of edge
computing architecture, its uses, benefits, and challenges for resource
scaling. We then introduce Service Level Agreements, and existing research on
devising algorithms used in edge computing environments to meet these
agreements, along with their benefits and drawbacks.

Motivation: 混合专家模型与推测解码结合时，多令牌验证会加剧GPU内存占用和CPU-GPU带宽竞争，现有MoE卸载系统未针对此瓶颈进行优化。

Method: 1) 利用草稿模型和目标模型的结构对应性预取可能专家；2) 基于经验配置和分析延迟模型的截止层策略；3) 异步预取线程和批量I/O的流水线运行时。

Result: 在多样化数据集、环境和MoE模型上，SP-MoE相比最先进方法实现了1.07-3.5倍的TPOT加速。

Conclusion: SP-MoE是首个SD感知的专家卸载和计算通信流水线框架，有效解决了MoE与推测解码结合时的性能瓶颈。

Abstract: The Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture has been widely adopted in large
language models (LLMs) to reduce computation cost through model sparsity.
Employing speculative decoding (SD) can further accelerate MoE inference by
drafting multiple tokens per step and verifying them in parallel. However,
combining MoE with SD inflates GPU memory and aggravates CPU-GPU bandwidth
contention during multi-token verification. Existing MoE offloading systems are
SD-agnostic and do not address this bottleneck. We present SP-MoE, the first
SD-aware expert-offloading and compute-communication pipelining framework.
SP-MoE introduces: (1) speculative expert prefetching that exploits structural
correspondence between the draft and target models to prefetch likely experts
ahead of verification; (2) a cutoff-layer policy that bounds per-layer prefetch
depth based on empirical profiles and an analytical latency model, guaranteeing
just-in-time availability without overfetch; and (3) a pipelined runtime with
asynchronous prefetch threads and batched I/O to hide loading latency.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that SP-MoE achieves a 1.07-3.5 times TPOT
speedup over state-of-the-art methods across diverse datasets, environments,
and MoE-based models.

Conclusion: FLAMMABLE有效解决了多模型联邦学习中的异构性挑战，并开发了首个多模型联邦学习基准平台，为未来可复现研究奠定了基础。

Abstract: Multi-Model Federated Learning (MMFL) is an emerging direction in Federated
Learning (FL) where multiple models are trained in parallel, generally on
various datasets. Optimizing the models' accuracies and training times in the
MMFL setting requires adapting to data and system heterogeneity across clients
as in single-model FL; these challenges are amplified in the MMFL setting due
to additional heterogeneity across models. Neither existing solutions nor
na\"ive extensions of single-model FL frameworks efficiently address these
challenges. To bridge this gap, we propose FLAMMABLE, a comprehensive MMFL
training framework. FLAMMABLE optimizes model training by intelligently
adapting client batch sizes while engaging them to train multiple carefully
chosen models, depending on their system capabilities, in each training round.
To evaluate FLAMMABLE, we develop the first benchmark platform for the MMFL
setting, which may enable future reproducible MMFL research. Extensive
evaluations on multiple datasets and models show that FLAMMABLE boosts the MMFL
time-to-accuracy performance by 1.1$\sim$10.0$\times$ while improving the final
model accuracy by 1.3$\sim$5.4\% compared to several known baselines.

Conclusion: DCP框架通过动态适应序列特性，有效减少了通信开销并改善了内存和计算平衡，在长上下文训练中表现出显著性能提升。

Abstract: Context parallelism has emerged as a key technique to support long-context
training, a growing trend in generative AI for modern large models. However,
existing context parallel methods rely on static parallelization configurations
that overlook the dynamic nature of training data, specifically, the
variability in sequence lengths and token relationships (i.e., attention
patterns) across samples. As a result, these methods often suffer from
unnecessary communication overhead and imbalanced computation. In this paper,
we present DCP, a dynamic context parallel training framework that introduces
fine-grained blockwise partitioning of both data and computation. By enabling
flexible mapping of data and computation blocks to devices, DCP can adapt to
varying sequence characteristics, effectively reducing communication and
improving memory and computation balance. Micro-benchmarks demonstrate that DCP
accelerates attention by 1.19x~2.45x under causal masks and 2.15x~3.77x under
sparse attention patterns. Additionally, we observe up to 0.94x~1.16x
end-to-end training speed-up for causal masks, and 1.00x~1.46x for sparse
masks.

CSP/FDR. Our fairness oracle and stability-based proof method are reusable
across coroutine runtime designs. We designed the claim/release protocol for a
process-oriented language -- ProcessJ -- to manage the race for claiming shared
inter-process communication channels. Internally, we use a lock-free queue to
park waiting processes for gaining access to a shared object, such as exclusive
access to a shared channel to read from or write to. The queue ensures control
and fairness for processes wishing to access a shared resource, as the protocol
handles claim requests in the order they are inserted into the queue. We
produce CSP models of our protocol and a mutex specification, demonstrating
with FDR that our protocol behaves as a locking mutex.

Abstract: In this paper we represent a new framework for integrated distributed and
reliable systems. In the proposed framework we have used three parts to
increase Satisfaction and Performance of this framework. At first we analyze
previous frameworks related to integrated systems, then represent new proposed
framework in order to improving previous framework, and we discuss its
different phases. Finally we compare the results of simulation of the new
framework with previous ones. In FIDRS framework, the technique of
heterogeneous distributed data base is used to improve Performance and speed in
responding to users and in this way we can improve dependability and
reliability of framework simultaneously. In extraction phase of the new
framework we have used RMSD algorithm that decreases responding time in big
database. Finally by using FDIRS framework we succeeded to increase Efficiency,
Performance and reliability of integrated systems and remove some of previous
frameworks problems.

### [248] [A Decentralized Microservice Scheduling Approach Using Service Mesh in Cloud-Edge Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11189)
*Yangyang Wen,Paul Townend,Per-Olov Östberg,Abel Souza,Clément Courageux-Sudan*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: 提出利用服务网格边车代理作为去中心化调度器的新架构方向，以解决云边环境中传统集中式调度在延迟、协调开销和容错方面的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着微服务系统在云边连续体中的扩展，传统集中式调度机制在延迟、协调开销和容错方面面临越来越大的挑战，需要新的调度架构来支持大规模云原生环境。

Method: 将轻量级、自主的调度逻辑嵌入到每个服务网格边车代理中，使调度决策能够在本地进行而无需集中控制，利用服务网格基础设施支持可编程分布式流量管理的能力。

Result: 初步结果显示该架构在响应时间和延迟方面具有可扩展性潜力，在不同请求速率下表现出良好的性能。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一个系统级架构方向，并提供了初步证据支持其可扩展性潜力，而非提供一个最终的调度算法。

Abstract: As microservice-based systems scale across the cloud-edge continuum,
traditional centralized scheduling mechanisms increasingly struggle with
latency, coordination overhead, and fault tolerance. This paper presents a new
architectural direction: leveraging service mesh sidecar proxies as
decentralized, in-situ schedulers to enable scalable, low-latency coordination
in large-scale, cloud-native environments. We propose embedding lightweight,
autonomous scheduling logic into each sidecar, allowing scheduling decisions to
be made locally without centralized control. This approach leverages the
growing maturity of service mesh infrastructures, which support programmable
distributed traffic management. We describe the design of such an architecture
and present initial results demonstrating its scalability potential in terms of
response time and latency under varying request rates. Rather than delivering a
finalized scheduling algorithm, this paper presents a system-level
architectural direction and preliminary evidence to support its scalability
potential.

### [249] [An Explorative Study on Distributed Computing Techniques in Training and Inference of Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11211)
*Sheikh Azizul Hakim,Saem Hasan*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: 该论文从两个角度探索了分布式计算技术在大型语言模型中的应用：一是研究如何在消费级计算机上运行大型模型，二是对三种最先进的LLM服务技术进行比较研究。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于当今拥有数十亿参数的大型语言模型过于庞大，几乎没有任何单个计算节点能够训练、微调或进行推理，因此需要引入分布式计算技术来有效利用这些模型。

Method: 1. 研究使大型语言模型民主化的技术，即在消费级计算机上运行大型模型的方法，并对现有系统进行基于元启发式的新颖修改实现。2. 对三种最先进的LLM服务技术进行对比研究。

Result: 论文提出了在消费级硬件上运行大型语言模型的解决方案，并比较了不同分布式服务技术的性能表现。

Conclusion: 分布式计算技术对于在资源受限环境中有效利用大型语言模型至关重要，通过适当的分布式策略可以在消费级硬件上实现LLM的部署和服务。

Abstract: Large language models (LLM) are advanced AI systems trained on extensive
textual data, leveraging deep learning techniques to understand and generate
human-like language. Today's LLMs with billions of parameters are so huge that
hardly any single computing node can train, fine-tune, or infer from them.
Therefore, several distributed computing techniques are being introduced in the
literature to properly utilize LLMs. We have explored the application of
distributed computing techniques in LLMs from two angles.
  \begin{itemize}
  \item We study the techniques that democratize the LLM, that is, how large
models can be run on consumer-grade computers. Here, we also implement a novel
metaheuristics-based modification to an existing system.
  \item We perform a comparative study on three state-of-the-art LLM serving
techniques. \end{itemize}

Result: 新的异步多任务算法相比现有方法在计算性能上有显著提升，并对性能改进原因进行了评估分析。

Conclusion: 异步多任务并行算法能有效解决S_N输运求解器在多核架构上的扩展性问题，显著提升计算性能。

Abstract: Discrete ordinates $S_N$ transport solvers on unstructured meshes pose a
challenge to scale due to complex data dependencies, memory access patterns and
a high-dimensional domain. In this paper, we review the performance bottlenecks
within the shared memory parallelization scheme of an existing transport solver
on modern many-core architectures with high core counts. With this analysis, we
then survey the performance of this solver across a variety of compute
hardware. We then present a new Asynchronous Many-Task (AMT) algorithm for
shared memory parallelism, present results showing an increase in computational
performance over the existing method, and evaluate why performance is improved.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 最小加权顶点覆盖是NP难问题，在网络监控和资源分配等应用中具有基础性作用，需要解决去中心化环境下的计算问题。

Abstract: We address the problem of computing a Minimum Weighted Vertex Cover (MWVC) in
a decentralized network. MWVC, a classical NP-hard problem, is foundational in
applications such as network monitoring and resource placement. We propose a
fully decentralized protocol where each node makes decisions using only local
knowledge and communicates with its neighbors. The method is adaptive,
communication-efficient, and avoids centralized coordination. We evaluate the
protocol on real-world and synthetic graphs, comparing it to both centralized
and decentralized baselines. Our results demonstrate competitive solution
quality with reduced communication overhead, highlighting the feasibility of
MWVC computation in decentralized environments.
