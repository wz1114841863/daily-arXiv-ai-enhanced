FlexLLM exposes key architectural degrees of freedom for stage-customized inference, enabling hybrid designs that tailor temporal reuse and spatial dataflow differently for prefill and decode, and provides a comprehensive quantization suite to support accurate low-bit deployment. Using FlexLLM, we build a complete inference system for the Llama-3.2 1B model in under two months with only 1K lines of code. The system includes: (1) a stage-customized accelerator with hardware-efficient quantization (12.68 WikiText-2 PPL) surpassing SpinQuant baseline, and (2) a Hierarchical Memory Transformer (HMT) plug-in for efficient long-context processing. On the AMD U280 FPGA at 16nm, the accelerator achieves 1.29$\\times$ end-to-end speedup, 1.64$\\times$ higher decode throughput, and 3.14$\\times$ better energy efficiency than an NVIDIA A100 GPU (7nm) running BF16 inference; projected results on the V80 FPGA at 7nm reach 4.71$\\times$, 6.55$\\times$, and 4.13$\\times$, respectively. In long-context scenarios, integrating the HMT plug-in reduces prefill latency by 23.23$\\times$ and extends the context window by 64$\\times$, delivering 1.10$\\times$/4.86$\\times$ lower end-to-end latency and 5.21$\\times$/6.27$\\times$ higher energy efficiency on the U280/V80 compared to the A100 baseline. FlexLLM thus bridges algorithmic innovation in LLM inference and high-performance accelerators with minimal manual effort."}

SNNs operate by propagating spikes between neurons that form a graph through synapses. Neuromorphic hardware mimics them through a network-on-chip, transmitting spikes, and a mesh of cores, each managing several neurons. Its operational cost is tied to spike movement and active cores. A mapping comprises two tasks: partitioning the SNN's graph to fit inside cores and placement of each partition on the hardware mesh. Both are NP-hard problems, and as SNNs and hardware scale towards billions of neurons, they become increasingly difficult to tackle effectively. In this work, we propose to raise the abstraction of SNNs from graphs to hypergraphs, redesigning mapping techniques accordingly. The resulting model faithfully captures the replication of spikes inside cores by exposing the notion of hyperedge co-membership between neurons. We further show that the overlap and locality of hyperedges strongly correlate with high-quality mappings, making these properties instrumental in devising mapping algorithms. By exploiting them directly, grouping neurons through shared hyperedges, communication traffic and hardware resource usage can be reduced be yond what just contracting individual connections attains. To substantiate this insight, we consider several partitioning and placement algorithms, some newly devised, others adapted from literature, and compare them over progressively larger and bio-plausible SNNs. Our results show that hypergraph based techniques can achieve better mappings than the state-of-the-art at several execution time regimes. Based on these observations, we identify a promising selection of algorithms to achieve effective mappings at any scale."}

The study begins with an in-depth analysis of the pSA process, focusing on the issues resulting from unexpected oscillations among p-bits. These oscillations hinder the energy reduction of the Ising model and thus obstruct the successful execution of pSA in complex tasks. Through detailed simulations, we unravel the root cause of this energy stagnation, identifying the feedback mechanism inherent to the pSA operation as the primary contributor to these disruptive oscillations. To address this challenge, we propose two novel algorithms, time average pSA (TApSA) and stalled pSA (SpSA). These algorithms are designed based on partial deactivation of p-bits and are thoroughly tested using Python simulations on maximum cut benchmarks that are typical combinatorial optimization problems. On the 16 benchmarks from 800 to 5,000 nodes, the proposed methods improve the normalized cut value from 0.8% to 98.4% on average in comparison with the conventional pSA."}

To address these challenges, we propose Exploration-Augmented Latent Inference for LLMs (ELILLM), a framework that reinterprets the LLM generation process as an encoding, latent space exploration, and decoding workflow. ELILLM explicitly explores portions of the design problem beyond the model's current knowledge while using a decoding module to handle familiar regions, generating chemically valid and synthetically reasonable molecules. In our implementation, Bayesian optimization guides the systematic exploration of latent embeddings, and a position-aware surrogate model efficiently predicts binding affinity distributions to inform the search. Knowledge-guided decoding further reduces randomness and effectively imposes chemical validity constraints. We demonstrate ELILLM on the CrossDocked2020 benchmark, showing strong controlled exploration and high binding affinity scores compared with seven baseline methods.

Experimental evaluation using the Lennard-Jones FRNN interaction model as a case study shows that the proposed update/rebuild ratio optimizer is capable of adapting to the different dynamics that emerge during a simulation, leading to a RT core pipeline up to $\\sim 3.4\\times$ faster than with other known approaches to manage the BVH. In terms of simulation step performance, the proposed variants can significantly improve the speedup and EE of the base RT core idea; from $\\sim1.3\\times$ at small radius to $\\sim2.0\\times$ for log normal radius distributions. Furthermore, the proposed variants manage to simulate cases that would otherwise not fit in memory because of the use of neighbor lists, such as clusters of particles with log normal radius distribution. The proposed RT Core technique to support periodic BC is indeed effective as it does not introduce any significant penalty in performance. In terms of scaling, the proposed methods scale both their performance and EE across GPU generations. Throughout the experimental evaluation, we also identify the simulation cases were regular GPU computation should still be preferred, contributing to the understanding of the strengths and limitations of RT cores."}

Data sparsity, where each expert processes only a subset of tokens, offers a complementary axis. Expert-choice routing implements data sparsity directly but violates causality in autoregressive models, creating train-inference mismatch. We recover data sparsity within causal token-choice MoE by leveraging zero-compute (null) experts within the routing pool. When a token routes to null experts, those slots consume no compute. The standard load balancing objective trains the model to uniformly use all experts (real and null) therefore creating data sparsity in expectation without the causality violations. We evaluate on vision-language model training, where data heterogeneity is pronounced: vision encoders produce many low-information tokens while text tokens are denser. At matched expected FLOPs, composing weight and data sparsity yields a more compute-efficient frontier than weight sparsity alone, with gains in training loss and downstream performance. The model learns implicit modality-aware allocation, routing vision tokens to null experts more aggressively than text, without explicit modality routing."}

Built on NVIDIA FLARE, FedUMM instantiates federation for a BLIP3o backbone via parameter-efficient fine-tuning: clients train lightweight LoRA adapters while freezing the foundation models, and the server aggregates only adapter updates. We evaluate on VQA v2 and the GenEval compositional generation benchmarks under Dirichlet-controlled heterogeneity with up to 16 clients. Results show slight degradation as client count and heterogeneity increase, while remaining competitive with centralized training. We further analyze computation--communication trade-offs and demonstrate that adapter-only federation reduces per-round communication by over an order of magnitude compared to full fine-tuning, enabling practical federated UMM training.

While Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) have shown promise in disentangling latent representations, existing SAE-based methods for diffusion model understanding rely on unsupervised approaches that fail to align sparse features with human-understandable concepts. This limits their ability to provide reliable semantic control over generated images. We introduce CASL (Concept-Aligned Sparse Latents), a supervised framework that aligns sparse latent dimensions of diffusion models with semantic concepts. CASL first trains an SAE on frozen U-Net activations to obtain disentangled latent representations, and then learns a lightweight linear mapping that associates each concept with a small set of relevant latent dimensions. To validate the semantic meaning of these aligned directions, we propose CASL-Steer, a controlled latent intervention that shifts activations along the learned concept axis. Unlike editing methods, CASL-Steer is used solely as a causal probe to reveal how concept-aligned latents influence generated content. We further introduce the Editing Precision Ratio (EPR), a metric that jointly measures concept specificity and the preservation of unrelated attributes. Experiments show that our method achieves superior editing precision and interpretability compared to existing approaches.

We model this scenario as a sequence of learning tasks where the input is a mix of natural and synthetic data, and the learning algorithms are oblivious to the origin of any individual example.\n  We study the possibilities and limitations of ERM in this setting. For the problem of estimating the mean of an arbitrary $d$-dimensional distribution, we find that while ERM converges to the true mean, it is outperformed by an algorithm that assigns non-uniform weights to examples from different generations of data.

Instead of subgraph replacement, we propose subgraph injection which preserves the structure of the original graphs while poisoning the clean graphs. Extensive experiments demonstrate the efficacy of our approach, where our attack achieves high attack success rates for all target labels with minimal impact on the clean accuracy. Experimental results on five dataset demonstrate the superior performance of our attack framework compared to the conventional subgraph replacement-based attack.

This study evaluates and compares three distinct predictive models: Seasonal AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average with eXogenous regressors (SARIMAX), EXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for forecasting daily ED arrivals over a seven-day horizon. Utilizing data from an Australian tertiary referral hospital spanning January 2017 to December 2021, this research distinguishes itself by decomposing demand into eight specific ward categories and stratifying patients by clinical complexity. To address data distortions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, the study employs the Prophet model to generate synthetic counterfactual values for the anomalous period. Experimental results demonstrate that all three proposed models consistently outperform a seasonal naive baseline. XGBoost demonstrated the highest accuracy for predicting total daily admissions with a Mean Absolute Error of 6.63, while the statistical SARIMAX model proved marginally superior for forecasting major complexity cases with an MAE of 3.77. The study concludes that while these techniques successfully reproduce regular day-to-day patterns, they share a common limitation in underestimating sudden, infrequent surges in patient volume."}

While inference-time strategies like foresight sampling attempt to mitigate this by simulating future steps, they typically rely on ad-hoc heuristics for valuing paths and pruning the search space. This paper introduces Martingale Foresight Sampling (MFS), a principled framework that reformulates LLM decoding as a problem of identifying an optimal stochastic process. By modeling the quality of a reasoning path as a stochastic process, we leverage Martingale theory to design a theoretically-grounded algorithm. Our approach replaces heuristic mechanisms with principles from probability theory: step valuation is derived from the Doob Decomposition Theorem to measure a path's predictable advantage, path selection uses Optional Stopping Theory for principled pruning of suboptimal candidates, and an adaptive stopping rule based on the Martingale Convergence Theorem terminates exploration once a path's quality has provably converged. Experiments on six reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that MFS surpasses state-of-the-art methods in accuracy while significantly improving computational efficiency.

While recent methods improve draft quality by tightly coupling the drafter with the target model, the verification mechanism itself remains largely unchanged, relying on strict token-level rejection sampling. In practice, modern LLMs frequently operate in low-margin regimes where the target model exhibits weak preference among top candidates. In such cases, rejecting plausible runner-up tokens yields negligible information gain while incurring substantial rollback cost, leading to a fundamental inefficiency in verification. We propose Margin-Aware Speculative Verification, a training-free and domain-agnostic verification strategy that adapts to the target model's local decisiveness. Our method conditions verification on decision stability measured directly from the target logits and relaxes rejection only when strict verification provides minimal benefit. Importantly, the approach modifies only the verification rule and is fully compatible with existing target-coupled speculative decoding frameworks. Extensive experiments across model scales ranging from 8B to 235B demonstrate that our method delivers consistent and significant inference speedups over state-of-the-art baselines while preserving generation quality across diverse benchmarks."}

We study Secchi Disk Depth (SDD) forecasting on a 30-lake, data-rich subset drawn from three decades of in situ records collected across Maine lakes. Missingness is handled via Multiple Imputation by Chained Equations (MICE), and we evaluate performance with a normalized Mean Absolute Error (nMAE) metric for cross-lake comparability. Among six candidates, ridge regression provides the best mean test performance. Using ridge regression, we then quantify the minimal sample size, showing that under a backward, recent-history protocol, the model reaches within 5% of full-history accuracy with approximately 176 training samples per lake on average. We also identify a minimal feature set, where a compact four-feature subset matches the thirteen-feature baseline within the same 5% tolerance. Bringing these results together, we introduce a joint feasibility function that identifies the minimal training history and fewest predictors sufficient to achieve the target of staying within 5% of the complete-history, full-feature baseline. In our study, meeting the 5% accuracy target required about 64 recent samples and just one predictor per lake, highlighting the practicality of targeted monitoring. Hence, our joint feasibility strategy unifies recent-history length and feature choice under a fixed accuracy target, yielding a simple, efficient rule for setting sampling effort and measurement priorities for lake researchers."}

However, due to the invasive nature of biomarker collection, most AD diagnoses are made in memory clinics using cognitive tests and evaluation of hippocampal atrophy based on MRI. While clinical assessment and hippocampal volume show high diagnostic accuracy for amnestic or typical AD (tAD), a substantial subgroup of AD patients with atypical presentation (atAD) are routinely misdiagnosed. To improve diagnosis of atAD patients, we propose a machine learning approach to distinguish between atAD and non-AD cognitive impairment using clinical testing battery and MRI data collected as standard-of-care. We develop and evaluate our approach using 1410 subjects across four groups (273 tAD, 184 atAD, 235 non-AD, and 685 cognitively normal) collected from one private data set and two public data sets from the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center (NACC) and the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). We perform multiple atAD vs. non-AD classification experiments using clinical features and hippocampal volume as well as a comprehensive set of MRI features from across the brain. The best performance is achieved by incorporating additional important MRI features, which outperforms using hippocampal volume alone. Furthermore, we use the Boruta statistical approach to identify and visualize significant brain regions distinguishing between diagnostic groups. Our ML approach improves the percentage of correctly diagnosed atAD cases (the recall) from 52% to 69% for NACC and from 34% to 77% for ADNI, while achieving high precision. The proposed approach has important implications for improving diagnostic accuracy for non-amnestic atAD in clinical settings using only clinical testing battery and MRI."}

In practice, models are often quantized (e.g., 4-bit) for deployment, but we find that quantization can catastrophically restore forgotten information [1]. In this paper, we (1) analyze why low-bit quantization undermines unlearning, and (2) propose a quantization-aware unlearning method to mitigate this. We first compute weight-change statistics and bucket overlaps in quantization to show that typical unlearning updates are too small to cross quantization thresholds. Building on this insight, we introduce a logits space hinge loss: for each forget example, we force the output logits of the unlearned model to differ from the original model by at least a margin (half the quantization step). This ensures forgotten examples remain distinguishable even after quantization. We evaluate on language and classification tasks (including a Twitter misinformation dataset) and show our method preserves forgetting under 4-bit quantization, whereas existing methods almost entirely recover the forgotten knowledge."}

We demonstrate that these geometric inductive biases can be viewed as a physical constraint and they are sufficient to induce unsupervised functional disentanglement alone. Using TinyStories as a controlled testbed for verifying spectral dynamics, we observe that Prism spontaneously specializes its attention heads into spectrally distinct regimes: low-frequency heads capturing long-range causal dependencies (signal) and high-frequency heads handling local syntactic constraints (noise). Our results suggest that interpretability and performance are not a trade-off, but can be unified through principled geometric construction."}

This challenge is exemplified by the CCC benchmark, where models operate over streams of 7.5M samples with continually changing corruption types and severities. We propose RDumb++, a principled extension of RDumb that introduces two drift-detection mechanisms i.e entropy-based drift scoring and KL-divergence drift scoring, together with adaptive reset strategies. These mechanisms allow the model to detect when accumulated adaptation becomes harmful and to recover before prediction collapse occurs. Across CCC-medium with three speeds and three seeds (nine runs, each containing one million samples), RDumb++ consistently surpasses RDumb, yielding approx 3% absolute accuracy gains while maintaining stable adaptation throughout the entire stream. Ablation experiments on drift thresholds and reset strengths further show that drift-aware resetting is essential for preventing collapse and achieving reliable long-horizon CTTA."}

A traditional ML approach is to use validation loss, i.e. to apply the training loss function on a validation set to guide these optimizations. However, ML for healthcare has a distinct goal from traditional ML: Models must perform well relative to specific clinical requirements, vs. relative to the loss function used for training. These clinical requirements can be captured more precisely by tailored metrics. Since many optimization tasks do not require the driving metric to be differentiable, they allow a wider range of options, including the use of metrics tailored to be clinically-relevant. In this paper we describe two controlled experiments which show how the use of clinically-tailored metrics provide superior model optimization compared to validation loss, in the sense of better performance on the clinical task. The use of clinically-relevant metrics for optimization entails some extra effort, to define the metrics and to code them into the pipeline. But it can yield models that better meet the central goal of ML for healthcare: strong performance in the clinic."}

We identify and formalize two fundamental obstacles: (i) the supervision gap in unobserved regions that prevents effective learning of physical correlations, and (ii) the dynamic spatial mismatch between incomplete inputs and complete solution fields. Specifically, our proposed Latent Autoregressive Neural Operator~(\\ours) introduces two novel components designed explicitly to address the core difficulties of partial observations: (i) a mask-to-predict training strategy that creates artificial supervision by strategically masking observed regions, and (ii) a Physics-Aware Latent Propagator that reconstructs solutions through boundary-first autoregressive generation in latent space.

We study a perishable inventory system with random lead times in which both the demand process and the lead time distribution are unknown. We consider a practical setting where orders are placed using limited historical data together with observed covariates and current system states. To improve learning efficiency under limited data, we adopt a marginal cost accounting scheme that assigns each order a single lifetime cost and yields a unified loss function for end-to-end learning. This enables training a deep learning-based policy that maps observed covariates and system states directly to order quantities. We develop two end-to-end variants: a purely black-box approach that outputs order quantities directly (E2E-BB), and a structure-guided approach that embeds the projected inventory level (PIL) policy, capturing inventory effects through explicit computation rather than additional learning (E2E-PIL). We further show that the objective induced by E2E-PIL is homogeneous of degree one, enabling a boosting technique from operational data analytics (ODA) that yields an enhanced policy (E2E-BPIL). Experiments on synthetic and real data establish a robust performance ordering: E2E-BB is dominated by E2E-PIL, which is further improved by E2E-BPIL. Using an excess-risk decomposition, we show that embedding heuristic policy structure reduces effective model complexity and improves learning efficiency with only a modest loss of flexibility. More broadly, our results suggest that deep learning-based decision tools are more effective and robust when guided by human knowledge, highlighting the value of integrating advanced analytics with inventory theory."}

We study this by formalizing over-sharpening, a phenomenon where the policy collapses onto limited modes, suppressing valid alternatives. At a high level, we discover finite-batch updates intrinsically bias learning toward sampled modes, triggering a collapse that propagates globally via semantic coupling. To mitigate this, we propose inverse-success advantage calibration to prioritize difficult queries and distribution-level calibration to diversify sampling via a memory network.

This brittleness hinders reliable real-world deployment, where the execution errors are inherently inevitable during tool interaction procedures. We identify a key limitation of current approaches: standard reinforcement learning (RL) treats errors as sparse negative rewards, providing no guidance on how to recover, while pre-collected synthetic error-correction datasets suffer from distribution mismatch with the model's on-policy error modes. To bridge this gap, we propose Fission-GRPO, a framework that converts execution errors into corrective supervision within the RL training loop. Our core mechanism fissions each failed trajectory into a new training instance by augmenting it with diagnostic feedback from a finetuned Error Simulator, then resampling recovery rollouts on-policy. This enables the model to learn from the precise errors it makes during exploration, rather than from static, pre-collected error cases. On the BFCL v4 Multi-Turn, Fission-GRPO improves the error recovery rate of Qwen3-8B by 5.7% absolute, crucially, yielding a 4% overall accuracy gain (42.75% to 46.75%) over GRPO and outperforming specialized tool-use agents."}

To address this limitation, we propose Dualformer, a principled dual-domain framework that rethinks frequency modeling from a layer-wise perspective. Dualformer introduces three key components: (1) a dual-branch architecture that concurrently models complementary temporal patterns in both time and frequency domains; (2) a hierarchical frequency sampling module that allocates distinct frequency bands to different layers, preserving high-frequency details in lower layers while modeling low-frequency trends in deeper layers; and (3) a periodicity-aware weighting mechanism that dynamically balances contributions from the dual branches based on the harmonic energy ratio of inputs, supported theoretically by a derived lower bound. This design enables structured frequency modeling and adaptive integration of time-frequency features, effectively preserving high-frequency information and enhancing generalization.

RLSEdit formulates editing as an online quadratic optimization with soft constraints, minimizing a cumulative key-value fitting objective with two regularizers that control for both deviation from the pre-trained weights and from a designated anchor mapping. The resulting update admits an efficient online recursion via the Woodbury identity, with per-edit cost independent of history length and scaling only with the current edit size. We further provide deviation bounds and an asymptotic characterization of the adherence-preservation trade-off in the many-edits regime. Experiments on multiple model families demonstrate stable scaling to 10K edits, outperforming strong baselines in both edit success and holistic stability -- crucially retaining early edits, and preserving general capabilities on GLUE and held-out reasoning/code benchmarks."}

While ZEH itself is simple, we demonstrate that evaluating the ZEH of state-of-the-art LLMs yields abundant insights. For example, by evaluating the ZEH of GPT-5.2, we found that GPT-5.2 cannot even compute the parity of a short string like 11000, and GPT-5.2 cannot determine whether the parentheses in ((((()))))) are balanced. This is surprising given the excellent capabilities of GPT-5.2. The fact that LLMs make mistakes on such simple problems serves as an important lesson when applying LLMs to safety-critical domains. By applying ZEH to Qwen2.5 and conducting detailed analysis, we found that while ZEH correlates with accuracy, the detailed behaviors differ, and ZEH provides clues about the emergence of algorithmic capabilities. Finally, while computing ZEH incurs significant computational cost, we discuss how to mitigate this cost by achieving up to one order of magnitude speedup using tree structures and online softmax."}

Federated GNNs (FGNNs) have emerged as a prominent distributed learning paradigm for training GNNs over decentralized data. However, FGNNs face two significant challenges: high communication overhead from multiple rounds of parameter exchanges and non-IID data characteristics across clients. To address these issues, we introduce CeFGC, a novel FGNN paradigm that facilitates efficient GNN training over non-IID data by limiting communication between the server and clients to three rounds only. The core idea of CeFGC is to leverage generative diffusion models to minimize direct client-server communication. Each client trains a generative diffusion model that captures its local graph distribution and shares this model with the server, which then redistributes it back to all clients. Using these generative models, clients generate synthetic graphs combined with their local graphs to train local GNN models. Finally, clients upload their model weights to the server for aggregation into a global GNN model. We theoretically analyze the I/O complexity of communication volume to show that CeFGC reduces to a constant of three communication rounds only. Extensive experiments on several real graph datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of CeFGC against state-of-the-art competitors, reflecting our superior performance on non-IID graphs by aligning local and global model objectives and enriching the training set with diverse graphs."}

Achieving near-optimal kernels requires expert-level understanding of hardware architectures and programming models, making kernel engineering a critical but notoriously time-consuming and non-scalable process. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) and LLM-based agents have opened new possibilities for automating kernel generation and optimization. LLMs are well-suited to compress expert-level kernel knowledge that is difficult to formalize, while agentic systems further enable scalable optimization by casting kernel development as an iterative, feedback-driven loop. Rapid progress has been made in this area. However, the field remains fragmented, lacking a systematic perspective for LLM-driven kernel generation. This survey addresses this gap by providing a structured overview of existing approaches, spanning LLM-based approaches and agentic optimization workflows, and systematically compiling the datasets and benchmarks that underpin learning and evaluation in this domain. Moreover, key open challenges and future research directions are further outlined, aiming to establish a comprehensive reference for the next generation of automated kernel optimization.

Although existing computational methods achieve strong performance on standard benchmarks, they often fail to generalize to realistic deployment scenarios, where most candidate drug pairs involve previously unseen drugs and validated interactions are scarce. We demonstrate that proximity in the embedding spaces of prevailing molecule-centric DDI models does not reliably correspond to interaction labels, and that simply scaling up model capacity therefore fails to improve generalization. To address these limitations, we propose GenRel-DDI, a generalizable relation learning framework that reformulates DDI prediction as a relation-centric learning problem, in which interaction representations are learned independently of drug identities. This relation-level abstraction enables the capture of transferable interaction patterns that generalize to unseen drugs and novel drug pairs. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmark demonstrate that GenRel-DDI consistently and significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, with particularly large gains on strict entity-disjoint evaluations, highlighting the effectiveness and practical utility of relation learning for robust DDI prediction.

We propose \\textbf{G}lobal \\textbf{O}ptimization for \\textbf{S}afety \\textbf{V}ector Extraction (GOSV), a framework that identifies safety-critical attention heads through global optimization over all heads simultaneously.

Through systematic analyses, we find that complete safety breakdown occurs when approximately 30\\% of total heads are repatched across all models. Building on these insights, we develop a novel inference-time white-box jailbreak method that exploits the identified safety vectors through activation repatching. Our attack substantially outperforms existing white-box attacks across all test models, providing strong evidence for the effectiveness of the proposed GOSV framework on LLM safety interpretability."}

This limitation does not arise from insufficient model capacity, but from treating post-training inference systems as monolithic operators while ignoring internal structures formed during learning. We show that gradient update events in large models are highly localized and selective, leaving many parameter dependencies statistically indistinguishable from their initialization distribution after training. As a result, post-training inference systems are structurally non-uniform and inherently decomposable. Based on this observation, we introduce a post-training statistical criterion and a structural annealing procedure that removes unsupported dependencies and reveals stable, independent substructures. This work establishes a post-training, model-agnostic structural view of inference systems and enables structured, parallel inference without modifying model functionality or interfaces."}

Second, we demonstrate the efficacy of MIAs in tabular data using several attack strategies, also including defenses. Furthermore, in a federated learning scenario, we consider the threat posed by an outsider adversary, which is often neglected. Third, we demonstrate the high vulnerability of single-outs (records with a unique signature) to MIAs. Lastly, we explore how MIAs transfer across model architectures. Our results point towards a general poor performance of these attacks in tabular data which contrasts with previous state-of-the-art. Notably, even attacks with limited attack performance can still successfully expose a large portion of single-outs.

However, existing research often adopts a fragmented approach, examining these determinants in isolation. This study addresses this gap by integrating hospital capacities, occupancy rates, reputation, and popularity with population SES and spatial mobility patterns to predict visitation flows and analyze influencing factors. Utilizing four years of SafeGraph mobility data and user experience data from Google Maps Reviews, five flow prediction models, Naive Regression, Gradient Boosting, Multilayer Perceptrons (MLPs), Deep Gravity, and Heterogeneous Graph Neural Networks (HGNN),were trained and applied to simulate visitation flows in Houston, Texas, U.S. The Shapley additive explanation (SHAP) analysis and the Partial Dependence Plot (PDP) method were employed to examine the combined impacts of different factors on visitation patterns. The findings reveal that Deep Gravity outperformed other models. Hospital capacities, ICU occupancy rates, ratings, and popularity significantly influence visitation patterns, with their effects varying across different travel distances. Short-distance visits are primarily driven by convenience, whereas long-distance visits are influenced by hospital ratings. White-majority areas exhibited lower sensitivity to hospital ratings for short-distance visits, while Asian populations and those with higher education levels prioritized hospital rating in their visitation decisions. SES further influence these patterns, as areas with higher proportions of Hispanic, Black, under-18, and over-65 populations tend to have more frequent hospital visits, potentially reflecting greater healthcare needs or limited access to alternative medical services."}

Traditionally, the flexibility index has been used to identify safe operating schedules by approximating the admissible uncertainty region using simple admissible uncertainty sets, such as hypercubes. Presently, available contextual information, such as forecasts, has not been considered to define the admissible uncertainty set when determining the flexibility index. We propose the conditional flexibility index (CFI), which extends the traditional flexibility index in two ways: by learning the parametrized admissible uncertainty set from historical data and by using contextual information to make the admissible uncertainty set conditional. This is achieved using a normalizing flow that learns a bijective mapping from a Gaussian base distribution to the data distribution. The admissible latent uncertainty set is constructed as a hypersphere in the latent space and mapped to the data space. By incorporating contextual information, the CFI provides a more informative estimate of flexibility by defining admissible uncertainty sets in regions that are more likely to be relevant under given conditions. Using an illustrative example, we show that no general statement can be made about data-driven admissible uncertainty sets outperforming simple sets, or conditional sets outperforming unconditional ones. However, both data-driven and conditional admissible uncertainty sets ensure that only regions of the uncertain parameter space containing realizations are considered. We apply the CFI to a security-constrained unit commitment example and demonstrate that the CFI can improve scheduling quality by incorporating temporal information."}

In the context of KRR, we investigate two alternative notions of intrinsic dimension. The first, denoted $d_ρ$, is the upper Minkowski dimension defined with respect to the canonical metric induced by a kernel function $K$ on a domain $Ω$. The second, denoted $d_K$, is the effective dimension, derived from the decay rate of Kolmogorov $n$-widths associated with $K$ on $Ω$. Given a probability measure $μ$ on $Ω$, we analyze the relationship between these $n$-widths and eigenvalues of the integral operator $φ\\to \\int_ΩK(\\cdot,x)φ(x)dμ(x)$. We show that, for a fixed domain $Ω$, the Kolmogorov $n$-widths characterize the worst-case eigenvalue decay across all probability measures $μ$ supported on $Ω$. These eigenvalues are central to understanding the generalization behavior of constrained KRR, enabling us to derive an excess error bound of order $O(n^{-\\frac{2+d_K}{2+2d_K} + ε})$ for any $ε> 0$, when the training set size $n$ is large. We also propose an algorithm that estimates upper bounds on the $n$-widths using only a finite sample from $μ$. For distributions close to uniform, we prove that $ε$-accurate upper bounds on all $n$-widths can be computed with high probability using at most $O\\left(ε^{-d_ρ}\\log\\frac{1}ε\\right)$ samples, with fewer required for small $n$.

To address this vulnerability, we propose the Feature-space Smoothing (FS) and theoretically prove that FS offers certified robustness on the feature representations of MLLMs. Specifically, FS transforms any feature encoder into a smoothed variant that is guaranteed to maintain a certified lower bound on the feature cosine similarity between clean and adversarial representations under $\\ell_2$-bounded attacks. Moreover, we indicate that the value of this Feature Cosine Similarity Bound (FCSB) derived from FS can be improved by enlarging the defined Gaussian robustness score on the vanilla encoder. Building upon this, we introduce the Purifier and Smoothness Mapper (PSM), a plug-and-play module that improves the Gaussian robustness score of MLLMs and thus enhances their certified robustness under FS, without requiring any retraining on MLLMs. We demonstrate that the FS with PSM not only provides a strong theoretical robustness guarantee but also exhibits superior empirical performance compared to adversarial training. Extensive experiments across diverse MLLMs and downstream tasks indicate the effectiveness of the FS-PSM, reducing the Attack Success Rate (ASR) of various white-box attacks from nearly 90\\% to about 1\\%."}

S.

The final version will be available on IEEE Xplore", "summary": "We propose a novel training regime termed counterfactual training that leverages counterfactual explanations to increase the explanatory capacity of models. Counterfactual explanations have emerged as a popular post-hoc explanation method for opaque machine learning models: they inform how factual inputs would need to change in order for a model to produce some desired output. To be useful in real-world decision-making systems, counterfactuals should be plausible with respect to the underlying data and actionable with respect to the feature mutability constraints. Much existing research has therefore focused on developing post-hoc methods to generate counterfactuals that meet these desiderata. In this work, we instead hold models directly accountable for the desired end goal: counterfactual training employs counterfactuals during the training phase to minimize the divergence between learned representations and plausible, actionable explanations. We demonstrate empirically and theoretically that our proposed method facilitates training models that deliver inherently desirable counterfactual explanations and additionally exhibit improved adversarial robustness."}

The study begins with an in-depth analysis of the pSA process, focusing on the issues resulting from unexpected oscillations among p-bits. These oscillations hinder the energy reduction of the Ising model and thus obstruct the successful execution of pSA in complex tasks. Through detailed simulations, we unravel the root cause of this energy stagnation, identifying the feedback mechanism inherent to the pSA operation as the primary contributor to these disruptive oscillations. To address this challenge, we propose two novel algorithms, time average pSA (TApSA) and stalled pSA (SpSA). These algorithms are designed based on partial deactivation of p-bits and are thoroughly tested using Python simulations on maximum cut benchmarks that are typical combinatorial optimization problems. On the 16 benchmarks from 800 to 5,000 nodes, the proposed methods improve the normalized cut value from 0.8% to 98.4% on average in comparison with the conventional pSA."}

FlexLLM exposes key architectural degrees of freedom for stage-customized inference, enabling hybrid designs that tailor temporal reuse and spatial dataflow differently for prefill and decode, and provides a comprehensive quantization suite to support accurate low-bit deployment. Using FlexLLM, we build a complete inference system for the Llama-3.2 1B model in under two months with only 1K lines of code. The system includes: (1) a stage-customized accelerator with hardware-efficient quantization (12.68 WikiText-2 PPL) surpassing SpinQuant baseline, and (2) a Hierarchical Memory Transformer (HMT) plug-in for efficient long-context processing. On the AMD U280 FPGA at 16nm, the accelerator achieves 1.29$\\times$ end-to-end speedup, 1.64$\\times$ higher decode throughput, and 3.14$\\times$ better energy efficiency than an NVIDIA A100 GPU (7nm) running BF16 inference; projected results on the V80 FPGA at 7nm reach 4.71$\\times$, 6.55$\\times$, and 4.13$\\times$, respectively. In long-context scenarios, integrating the HMT plug-in reduces prefill latency by 23.23$\\times$ and extends the context window by 64$\\times$, delivering 1.10$\\times$/4.86$\\times$ lower end-to-end latency and 5.21$\\times$/6.27$\\times$ higher energy efficiency on the U280/V80 compared to the A100 baseline. FlexLLM thus bridges algorithmic innovation in LLM inference and high-performance accelerators with minimal manual effort."}
