TL;DR: 本文分析了三种不同厂商的CXL内存扩展卡性能，研究了CXL内存对HPC应用和大语言模型的性能影响，并提出了数据对象级交错策略来优化内存访问模式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CXL作为新兴内存接口技术，其性能特性因生产硬件有限而尚不明确。需要了解CXL内存的使用场景、对应用性能的影响以及如何与现有内存组件结合使用。

Method: 使用三种不同厂商的CXL内存扩展卡进行性能测试，包括基础性能表征、HPC应用和LLM性能评估、内存分层与页面交错研究，并提出数据对象级交错策略。

Result: 研究揭示了使用CXL内存面临的挑战和机遇，展示了CXL内存对应用性能的具体影响以及内存分层与交错策略的效果。

Conclusion: CXL内存技术具有重要应用潜力，但需要针对具体使用场景优化内存管理策略，数据对象级交错策略能够有效匹配内存访问模式。

Abstract: Compute eXpress Link (CXL) is emerging as a promising memory interface
technology. However, its performance characteristics remain largely unclear due
to the limited availability of production hardware. Key questions include: What
are the use cases for the CXL memory? What are the impacts of the CXL memory on
application performance? How to use the CXL memory in combination with existing
memory components? In this work, we study the performance of three genuine CXL
memory-expansion cards from different vendors. We characterize the basic
performance of the CXL memory, study how HPC applications and large language
models (LLM) can benefit from the CXL memory, and study the interplay between
memory tiering and page interleaving. We also propose a novel data object-level
interleaving policy to match the interleaving policy with memory access
patterns. Our findings reveal the challenges and opportunities of using the CXL
memory.

### [2] [Stratum: System-Hardware Co-Design with Tiered Monolithic 3D-Stackable DRAM for Efficient MoE Serving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05245)

Main category: cs.AR

TL;DR: Stratum是一个系统-硬件协同设计方法，结合了单片3D堆叠DRAM、近内存处理和GPU加速，专门用于优化MoE模型的部署性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MoE模型虽然具有数十亿参数容量且推理成本较低，但由于MoE层引入的大量数据量，在硬件部署上存在挑战。

Method: 采用单片3D堆叠DRAM技术，通过混合键合连接逻辑和DRAM芯片，利用硅中介层连接DRAM堆栈和GPU。通过构建内部内存层级和基于专家使用预测的数据分配来优化NMP吞吐量。

Result: 与GPU基线相比，Stratum系统在各种基准测试中实现了最高8.29倍的解码吞吐量提升和7.66倍的能效提升。

Conclusion: Stratum通过创新的系统-硬件协同设计成功解决了MoE模型部署的挑战，显著提升了性能和能效。

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) continue to evolve, Mixture of Experts (MoE)
architecture has emerged as a prevailing design for achieving state-of-the-art
performance across a wide range of tasks. MoE models use sparse gating to
activate only a handful of expert sub-networks per input, achieving
billion-parameter capacity with inference costs akin to much smaller models.
However, such models often pose challenges for hardware deployment due to the
massive data volume introduced by the MoE layers. To address the challenges of
serving MoE models, we propose Stratum, a system-hardware co-design approach
that combines the novel memory technology Monolithic 3D-Stackable DRAM (Mono3D
DRAM), near-memory processing (NMP), and GPU acceleration. The logic and Mono3D
DRAM dies are connected through hybrid bonding, whereas the Mono3D DRAM stack
and GPU are interconnected via silicon interposer. Mono3D DRAM offers higher
internal bandwidth than HBM thanks to the dense vertical interconnect pitch
enabled by its monolithic structure, which supports implementations of
higher-performance near-memory processing. Furthermore, we tackle the latency
differences introduced by aggressive vertical scaling of Mono3D DRAM along the
z-dimension by constructing internal memory tiers and assigning data across
layers based on access likelihood, guided by topic-based expert usage
prediction to boost NMP throughput. The Stratum system achieves up to 8.29x
improvement in decoding throughput and 7.66x better energy efficiency across
various benchmarks compared to GPU baselines.

### [3] [DeepV: A Model-Agnostic Retrieval-Augmented Framework for Verilog Code Generation with a High-Quality Knowledge Base](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05327)
*Zahin Ibnat,Paul E. Calzada,Rasin Mohammed Ihtemam,Sujan Kumar Saha,Jingbo Zhou,Farimah Farahmandi,Mark Tehranipoor*

Main category: cs.AR

TL;DR: DeepV是一个模型无关的RAG框架，用于生成RTL设计，通过高质量数据集增强上下文，无需RTL特定训练，在VerilogEval基准上性能提升近17%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM方法在硬件设计自动化中存在缺陷：无法整合新IP到知识库导致代码生成质量差，且基于旧模型的微调方法无法与改进的通用LLM竞争。现有RAG技术存在代码库质量低、计算成本高或未直接用于RTL生成的问题。

Method: 提出DeepV框架，使用大规模高质量数据集增强上下文，采用检索增强生成(RAG)方法，无需RTL特定训练，模型无关且兼容最新商业LLM如GPT-5。

Result: 在VerilogEval基准测试中，DeepV框架使GPT-5性能提升近17%，证明该方法能有效提高RTL代码生成质量。

Conclusion: DeepV框架通过高质量数据集和RAG方法成功解决了现有LLM在RTL生成中的局限性，为硬件设计自动化提供了有效的解决方案，已在Hugging Face上开源供社区使用。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) continue to be integrated into modern
technology, there has been an increased push towards code generation
applications, which also naturally extends to hardware design automation.
LLM-based solutions for register transfer level (RTL) code generation for
intellectual property (IP) designs have grown, especially with fine-tuned LLMs,
prompt engineering, and agentic approaches becoming popular in literature.
However, a gap has been exposed in these techniques, as they fail to integrate
novel IPs into the model's knowledge base, subsequently resulting in poorly
generated code. Additionally, as general-purpose LLMs continue to improve,
fine-tuned methods on older models will not be able to compete to produce more
accurate and efficient designs. Although some retrieval augmented generation
(RAG) techniques exist to mitigate challenges presented in fine-tuning
approaches, works tend to leverage low-quality codebases, incorporate
computationally expensive fine-tuning in the frameworks, or do not use RAG
directly in the RTL generation step. In this work, we introduce DeepV: a
model-agnostic RAG framework to generate RTL designs by enhancing context
through a large, high-quality dataset without any RTL-specific training. Our
framework benefits the latest commercial LLM, OpenAI's GPT-5, with a near 17%
increase in performance on the VerilogEval benchmark. We host DeepV for use by
the community in a Hugging Face (HF) Space:
https://huggingface.co/spaces/FICS-LLM/DeepV.

### [4] [From Principles to Practice: A Systematic Study of LLM Serving on Multi-core NPUs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05632)
*Tianhao Zhu,Dahu Feng,Erhu Feng,Yubin Xia*

Main category: cs.AR

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种针对多核NPU的多级仿真框架，通过优化张量并行策略、核心放置策略和内存管理，在LLM推理服务中实现了1.32x-6.03x的性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型的广泛应用，对高性能推理服务的需求不断增长。现有的多核AI加速器虽然具有可扩展性，但缺乏SIMT架构的灵活性，容易导致计算资源利用率不足和推理性能不佳。

Method: 开发了包含事务级和性能模型仿真的多级仿真框架，系统分析了张量并行策略、核心放置策略、内存管理方法以及PD解聚与PD融合的选择。

Result: 在不同硬件配置下，相比最先进的多核NPU设计，解决方案实现了1.32倍到6.03倍的加速比。

Conclusion: 该研究为多核NPU在各种LLM工作负载下设计最优硬件架构和服务策略提供了指导。

Abstract: With the widespread adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs), the demand for
high-performance LLM inference services continues to grow. To meet this demand,
a growing number of AI accelerators have been proposed, such as Google TPU,
Huawei NPU, Graphcore IPU, and Cerebras WSE, etc. Most of these accelerators
adopt multi-core architectures to achieve enhanced scalability, but lack the
flexibility of SIMT architectures. Therefore, without careful configuration of
the hardware architecture, as well as deliberate design of tensor parallelism
and core placement strategies, computational resources may be underutilized,
resulting in suboptimal inference performance.
  To address these challenges, we first present a multi-level simulation
framework with both transaction-level and performance-model-based simulation
for multi-core NPUs. Using this simulator, we conduct a systematic analysis and
further propose the optimal solutions for tensor parallelism strategies, core
placement policies, memory management methods, as well as the selection between
PD-disaggregation and PD-fusion on multi-core NPUs. We conduct comprehensive
experiments on representative LLMs and various NPU configurations. The
evaluation results demonstrate that, our solution can achieve 1.32x-6.03x
speedup compared to SOTA designs for multi-core NPUs across different hardware
configurations. As for LLM serving, our work offers guidance on designing
optimal hardware architectures and serving strategies for multi-core NPUs
across various LLM workloads.

### [5] [An opportunity to improve Data Center Efficiency: Optimizing the Server's Upgrade Cycle](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05787)
*Panagiota Nikolaou,Freddy Gabbay,Jawad Haj-Yahya,Yiannakis Sazeides*

Main category: cs.AR

TL;DR: 通过优化服务器升级计划来提高数据中心效率，研究发现全局升级计划比局部升级计划表现更好，可以显著提升QPS/(TCOxCO2)指标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提高数据中心效率，通过确定替换旧服务器的最佳时机来优化服务器升级计划。

Method: 基于历史服务器数据的研究，制定覆盖数据中心整个生命周期的全局升级计划，利用服务器进入年份、性能和功耗等信息。

Result: 研究发现最优全局升级计划可能涉及非固定时间段的升级，且优于局部升级计划。全局计划可以显著提高QPS/(TCOxCO2)指标。

Conclusion: 全局升级计划在数据中心效率优化方面优于传统的局部升级方法，应考虑未来服务器发布信息来制定更有效的升级策略。

Abstract: This work aims to improve a data center's efficiency by optimizing the server
upgrade plan: determine the optimal timing for replacing old servers with new
ones. The opportunity presented by this approach is demonstrated through a
study based on historical server data. The study establishes a significant
opportunity to increase the QPS/(TCOxCO2) metric by formulating a global
upgrade plan at the data center's design time covering its entire life cycle.
This plan leverages information, such as server entry year, performance, and
active power consumption for both existing and future servers. Our findings
reveal that an optimal global upgrade plan, may involve upgrades at non fixed
time periods and outperforms local upgrade plans. Local upgrade plans follow a
fixed, equal-length cycle and make decisions based only on currently available
server models. These local plans select the best available server at each
upgrade cycle without accounting for future server releases.

### [6] [Tiny but Mighty: A Software-Hardware Co-Design Approach for Efficient Multimodal Inference on Battery-Powered Small Devices](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05109)
*Yilong Li,Shuai Zhang,Yijing Zeng,Hao Zhang,Xinmiao Xiong,Jingyu Liu,Pan Hu,Suman Banerjee*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: NANOMIND是一个硬件-软件协同设计的大模型推理框架，通过将大模型分解为模块化组件并在异构加速器上动态调度，显著提升了能效和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大模型通常以整体方式运行，无法充分利用现代SoC中的异构加速器（NPU、GPU、DSP等），导致高延迟和低能效。

Method: 将大模型分解为视觉、语言、音频等模块化"砖块"，通过模块级动态卸载技术将各组件映射到最适合的加速器上运行，结合定制硬件设计、系统级调度和优化的低比特计算内核。

Result: 系统在资源效率上优于现有实现，能耗降低42.3%，GPU内存使用减少11.2%，电池供电设备可运行LLaVA-OneVision近半天，LLaMA-3-8B语音交互达20.8小时。

Conclusion: NANOMIND框架通过模块化分解和异构加速器调度，实现了在资源受限设备上高效运行大模型，为边缘智能设备提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) are inherently modular, consisting of vision
and audio encoders, projectors, and large language models. Yet, they are almost
always executed monolithically, which underutilizes the heterogeneous
accelerators (NPUs, GPUs, DSPs) in modern SoCs and leads to high end-to-end
latency. In this paper, we present NANOMIND, a hardware--software co-design
inference framework for Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) that breaks large models
into modular ``bricks'' (vision, language, audio, etc.) and maps each to its
ideal accelerator. The key insight is that large models can be broken into
modular components and scheduled to run on the most appropriate compute units.
It performs module-level dynamic offloading across accelerators on
unified-memory SoCs. By combining customized hardware design, system-level
scheduling, and optimized low-bit computation kernels, we demonstrate our
framework with a compact, battery-powered device capable of running LMMs
entirely on device. This prototype functions as a self-contained intelligent
assistant that requires no network connectivity, while achieving higher
throughput and superior power efficiency under strict resource constraints. The
design further bypasses CPU bottlenecks and reduces redundant memory usage
through token-aware buffer management and module-level coordination. Our system
outperforms existing implementations in resource efficiency, cutting energy
consumption by 42.3\% and GPU memory usage by 11.2\%. This enables a
battery-powered device to run LLaVA-OneVision with a camera for nearly half a
day and LLaMA-3-8B for voice interactions up to almost 20.8 hours.

### [7] [Agora: Bridging the GPU Cloud Resource-Price Disconnect](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05111)
*Ian McDougall,Noah Scott,Joon Huh,Kirthevasan Kandasamy,Karthikeyan Sankaralingam*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于特征的新型GPU云定价框架，直接根据内存带宽等资源消耗来定价，以解决传统基于时间定价模型对带宽受限工作负载的经济低效问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 摩尔定律在现代GPU上出现分歧：虽然FLOPs持续经济扩展，但内存带宽未能同步增长，导致价格性能脱节。传统基于时间的云GPU定价模型未能考虑内存带宽的边际成本上升，造成市场扭曲和硬件分配低效。

Method: 提出了特征定价框架，将成本直接与资源消耗（包括内存带宽）挂钩。设计了Agora系统架构来实现该框架，通过50微秒或10微秒的采样周期来精确测量资源使用。

Result: 50微秒采样可实现近乎理想的定价效果，仅损失5%收入；10微秒采样效果更好，仅损失2.4%收入。现代遥测系统已能提供这种测量频率，原型实现验证了系统的可行性。

Conclusion: 特征定价框架能够在不同GPU应用和硬件代际上创建更透明高效的云GPU资源市场，解决了传统定价模型的经济低效问题。

Abstract: The historic trend of Moore's Law, which predicted exponential growth in
computational performance per dollar, has diverged for modern Graphics
Processing Units (GPUs). While Floating Point Operations per Second (FLOPs)
capabilities have continued to scale economically, memory bandwidth has not,
creating a significant price-performance disconnect. This paper argues that the
prevailing time-based pricing models for cloud GPUs are economically
inefficient for bandwidth-bound workloads. These models fail to account for the
rising marginal cost of memory bandwidth, leading to market distortions and
suboptimal hardware allocation. To address this, we propose a novel
feature-based pricing framework that directly links cost to resource
consumption, including but not limited to memory bandwidth. We provide a robust
economic and algorithmic definition of this framework and introduce Agora, a
practical and secure system architecture for its implementation. Our
implementation of Agora shows that a 50us sampling provides nearly perfect
pricing as what ideal sampling would provide - losing only 5\% of revenue. 10us
sampling is even better result in 2.4\% loss. Modern telemetry systems can
already provide this rate of measurement, and our prototype implementation
shows the system design for feature-based pricing is buildable. Our evaluation
across diverse GPU applications and hardware generations empirically validates
the effectiveness of our approach in creating a more transparent and efficient
market for cloud GPU resources.

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: FlexPipe是一个可编程的流水线并行框架，通过领域特定语言和自动调度器，实现了高效的流水线调度自动探索和灵活定制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有流水线并行方法依赖预定义调度策略，无法自动适应新兴模型架构，且手动实现调度面临巨大编码负担和不断变化的需求。

Method: 开发了FlexPipe框架，包含简洁的领域特定语言和自动调度器，支持广泛的调度类型自动探索和用户自定义调度。

Result: 相比主流大规模并行框架Megtron-LM性能提升最高达2.28倍，相比最先进的自动流水线并行框架性能提升最高达1.49倍。

Conclusion: FlexPipe在生产力、可编程性、可调试性和调优便利性方面表现出色，为流水线并行提供了高效的自动化解决方案。

Abstract: Pipeline parallelism is an essential distributed parallelism method.
Increasingly complex and diverse DNN models necessitate meticulously customized
pipeline schedules for performance. However, existing practices typically rely
on predefined schedules, each with strengths, but fail to adapt automatically
to the emerging model architectures. Exploring novel high-efficiency schedules
is daunting due to the enormous and varying schedule space. Besides, manually
implementing schedules can be challenging due to the onerous coding burdens and
constantly changing needs. Unfortunately, existing frameworks have limitations
in automated schedule exploration and lack flexibility and controllability.
  This paper presents FlexPipe, a programmable pipeline parallelism framework
with enhanced productivity, programmability, debuggability, and ease of tuning.
FlexPipe has two main components: a succinct domain-specific language (DSL) and
an automated scheduler. FlexPipe enables automated schedule exploration for
various parallel scenarios within a broad spectrum of schedule types at a small
search cost. Besides, users can swiftly develop and customize schedules using
the FlexPipe DSL, which embodies flexible controllability in the pipeline order
of micro-batch computations over stages. It also provides convenient mechanisms
to include new operations in schedules to meet changing demands. Our evaluation
results demonstrate that FlexPipe achieves up to 2.28X performance speedup
compared to the popular large-scale parallel framework Megtron-LM, and gains up
to 1.49X performance speedup compared to the state-of-the-art automated
pipeline parallelism framework.

TL;DR: Lumos是一个用于评估无服务器运行时性能的模型和基准测试工具，特别关注边缘云连续体中的WebAssembly性能。研究发现AoT编译的Wasm镜像比容器小30倍，冷启动延迟降低16%，但解释型Wasm的延迟高55倍且I/O序列化开销大10倍。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: WebAssembly作为轻量级可移植运行时在边缘云连续体中执行无服务器函数，但其性能优势与权衡尚未充分理解，需要系统性的性能评估工具。

Method: 开发Lumos性能模型和基准测试工具，识别工作负载、系统和环境级性能驱动因素，对最先进的容器和Wasm运行时（解释模式和AoT编译模式）进行基准测试。

Result: AoT编译的Wasm镜像比容器小30倍，冷启动延迟降低16%；解释型Wasm的延迟高55倍，I/O序列化开销大10倍。

Conclusion: AoT编译的Wasm在边缘云连续体中具有显著优势，特别是镜像大小和冷启动性能，但解释型Wasm性能较差，需要权衡选择。

Abstract: WebAssembly has emerged as a lightweight and portable runtime to execute
serverless functions, particularly in heterogeneous and resource-constrained
environments such as the Edge Cloud Continuum. However, the performance
benefits versus trade-offs remain insufficiently understood. This paper
presents Lumos, a performance model and benchmarking tool for characterizing
serverless runtimes. Lumos identifies workload, system, and environment-level
performance drivers in the Edge-Cloud Continuum. We benchmark state-of-the-art
containers and the Wasm runtime in interpreted mode and with ahead-of-time
compilation. Our performance characterization shows that AoT-compiled Wasm
images are up to 30x smaller and decrease cold-start latency by up to 16%
compared to containers, while interpreted Wasm suffers up to 55x higher warm
latency and up to 10x I/O-serialization overhead.

*Harshit Goyal*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: 使用随机森林回归预测大数据流水线资源利用率的AI方法，在Google Borg集群数据上实现高精度预测，为云环境成本感知自动扩缩容提供解决方案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代云计算中资源分配面临挑战：过度配置导致不必要成本，配置不足则带来性能下降和SLA违规风险。需要智能方法来优化资源利用率。

Method: 预处理Google Borg集群跟踪数据，清理、转换并提取相关特征（CPU、内存、使用分布），使用随机森林回归模型预测资源利用率。

Result: 模型达到高预测精度（R平方=0.99，MAE=0.0048，RMSE=0.137），能捕捉工作负载特征与资源利用率之间的非线性关系。在中小型作业上表现优异，大型作业方差较高。

Conclusion: AI驱动的预测方法在云环境中具有成本感知自动扩缩容的潜力，可减少不必要的资源配置同时保障服务质量。

Abstract: Efficient resource allocation is a key challenge in modern cloud computing.
Over-provisioning leads to unnecessary costs, while under-provisioning risks
performance degradation and SLA violations. This work presents an artificial
intelligence approach to predict resource utilization in big data pipelines
using Random Forest regression. We preprocess the Google Borg cluster traces to
clean, transform, and extract relevant features (CPU, memory, usage
distributions). The model achieves high predictive accuracy (R Square = 0.99,
MAE = 0.0048, RMSE = 0.137), capturing non-linear relationships between
workload characteristics and resource utilization. Error analysis reveals
impressive performance on small-to-medium jobs, with higher variance in rare
large-scale jobs. These results demonstrate the potential of AI-driven
prediction for cost-aware autoscaling in cloud environments, reducing
unnecessary provisioning while safeguarding service quality.

TL;DR: FlashResearch是一个高效的深度研究框架，通过将顺序推理转换为并行、运行时编排来解决传统深度研究代理的延迟和效率问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统深度研究代理的顺序推理过程导致高延迟、运行时适应性差和资源分配效率低，无法满足交互式应用需求。

Method: 提出自适应规划器动态分配计算资源，实时编排层监控研究进度并剪枝冗余路径，以及多维度并行化框架实现研究广度和深度的并发。

Result: 实验显示FlashResearch在固定时间预算内持续提升最终报告质量，在保持可比质量的同时实现高达5倍的加速。

Conclusion: FlashResearch通过并行化和动态资源管理有效解决了深度研究中的效率瓶颈，为交互式研究应用提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Deep research agents, which synthesize information across diverse sources,
are significantly constrained by their sequential reasoning processes. This
architectural bottleneck results in high latency, poor runtime adaptability,
and inefficient resource allocation, making them impractical for interactive
applications. To overcome this, we introduce FlashResearch, a novel framework
for efficient deep research that transforms sequential processing into
parallel, runtime orchestration by dynamically decomposing complex queries into
tree-structured sub-tasks. Our core contributions are threefold: (1) an
adaptive planner that dynamically allocates computational resources by
determining research breadth and depth based on query complexity; (2) a
real-time orchestration layer that monitors research progress and prunes
redundant paths to reallocate resources and optimize efficiency; and (3) a
multi-dimensional parallelization framework that enables concurrency across
both research breadth and depth. Experiments show that FlashResearch
consistently improves final report quality within fixed time budgets, and can
deliver up to a 5x speedup while maintaining comparable quality.

*Yuanzhe Shen,Yide Liu,Zisu Huang,Ruicheng Yin,Xiaoqing Zheng,Xuanjing Huang*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: SATER是一种双模式兼容方法，通过最短响应偏好优化和置信度感知拒绝机制来微调模型，显著减少冗余输出和响应时间，在保持性能的同时大幅降低计算成本和级联延迟。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型性能优异但成本高昂，小型语言模型成本低但能力有限。现有路由策略各有优缺点，需要一种能同时解决预生成路由和级联路由局限性的方法。

Method: 提出SATER方法，通过最短响应偏好优化和置信度感知拒绝机制来微调模型，实现预生成路由和级联路由的双模式兼容。

Result: 在三个小型语言模型和六个不同复杂度的数据集上测试，SATER在保持可比性能的同时，计算成本降低超过50%，级联延迟降低超过80%。

Conclusion: SATER方法有效解决了语言模型选择中的性能与成本权衡问题，显著提升了路由策略的效率，为实际应用提供了实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable performance across
diverse tasks, yet their effectiveness frequently depends on costly commercial
APIs or cloud services. Model selection thus entails a critical trade-off
between performance and cost: high-performing LLMs typically incur substantial
expenses, whereas budget-friendly small language models (SLMs) are constrained
by limited capabilities. Current research primarily proposes two routing
strategies: pre-generation routing and cascade routing. Both approaches have
distinct characteristics, with cascade routing typically offering superior
cost-effectiveness and accuracy despite its higher latency. To further address
the limitations of both approaches, we introduce SATER, a dual-mode compatible
approach that fine-tunes models through shortest-response preference
optimization and a confidence-aware rejection mechanism. SATER significantly
reduces redundant outputs and response times, while improving both the
performance of pre-generation routing and the efficiency of cascade routing.
Experiments across three SLMs and six datasets, varying in type and complexity,
demonstrate that SATER achieves comparable performance while consistently
reducing computational costs by over 50\% and cascade latency by over 80\%.

Method: 利用CXL内存共享技术，将MPI通信转换为内存事务，解决CXL内存共享在MPI通信中的数据对象管理、缓存一致性和原子操作等挑战。

Result: CXL内存共享比基于TCP的互连延迟降低7.2-8.1倍，在小型消息传输中，cMPI在延迟和带宽上分别比标准以太网NIC和高性能SmartNIC高出49倍和72倍。

Conclusion: cMPI证明了CXL内存共享在优化MPI通信方面的巨大潜力，能够显著提升性能并简化通信协议栈。

Abstract: Message Passing Interface (MPI) is a foundational programming model for
high-performance computing. MPI libraries traditionally employ network
interconnects (e.g., Ethernet and InfiniBand) and network protocols (e.g., TCP
and RoCE) with complex software stacks for cross-node communication. We present
cMPI, the first work to optimize MPI point-to-point communication (both
one-sided and two-sided) using CXL memory sharing on a real CXL platform,
transforming cross-node communication into memory transactions and data copies
within CXL memory, bypassing traditional network protocols. We analyze
performance across various interconnects and find that CXL memory sharing
achieves 7.2x-8.1x lower latency than TCP-based interconnects deployed in
small- and medium-scale clusters. We address challenges of CXL memory sharing
for MPI communication, including data object management over the dax
representation [50], cache coherence, and atomic operations. Overall, cMPI
outperforms TCP over standard Ethernet NIC and high-end SmartNIC by up to 49x
and 72x in latency and bandwidth, respectively, for small messages.

*Hongpei Li,Han Zhang,Huikang Liu,Dongdong Ge,Yinyu Ye*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于优化视角的流水线调度方法，通过联合考虑内存容量、激活重用和流水线气泡最小化，动态优化内存与时间的权衡，相比现有启发式方法显著提升了吞吐量和内存利用率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有流水线并行方法主要依赖启发式策略，忽视了内存、计算和调度延迟之间的细粒度权衡，需要从优化角度重新审视流水线调度问题。

Method: 将调度问题建模为约束优化问题，联合考虑内存容量、激活重用和流水线气泡最小化，动态优化内存与时间的权衡，生成细粒度调度策略。

Result: 在相同设备内存限制下，流水线空闲时间减少高达50%，在某些情况下能够在有限内存预算内训练更大模型，吞吐量和内存利用率均得到提升。

Conclusion: 通过优化视角重新审视流水线调度，能够更有效地平衡内存与计算资源，为大规模语言模型训练提供更高效的并行策略。

Abstract: Pipeline parallelism (PP) has become a standard technique for scaling large
language model (LLM) training across multiple devices. However, despite recent
progress in reducing memory consumption through activation offloading, existing
approaches remain largely heuristic and coarse-grained, often overlooking the
fine-grained trade-offs between memory, computation, and scheduling latency. In
this work, we revisit the pipeline scheduling problem from a principled
optimization perspective. We observe that prevailing strategies either rely on
static rules or aggressively offload activations without fully leveraging the
interaction between memory constraints and scheduling efficiency. To address
this, we formulate scheduling as a constrained optimization problem that
jointly accounts for memory capacity, activation reuse, and pipeline bubble
minimization. Solving this model yields fine-grained schedules that reduce
pipeline bubbles while adhering to strict memory budgets. Our approach
complements existing offloading techniques: whereas prior approaches trade
memory for time in a fixed pattern, we dynamically optimize the tradeoff with
respect to model structure and hardware configuration. Experimental results
demonstrate that our method consistently improves both throughput and memory
utilization. In particular, we reduce idle pipeline time by up to 50% under the
same per-device memory limit, and in some cases, enable the training of larger
models within limited memory budgets.

TL;DR: 本文对MoE架构LLM的数据移动瓶颈进行了系统性分析，通过大规模测试发现专家选择机制是主要性能瓶颈，并提出优化方案在DeepSeek V3和Qwen3上分别实现6.3倍和4.0倍加速。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MoE架构LLM虽然性能显著提升，但其随机专家选择机制在多单元服务系统中引入了严重的数据移动开销，成为主要性能瓶颈。

Method: 对三个最先进的大规模MoE模型（200B-671B）进行数据移动为中心的性能分析，使用超过24,000个请求，生成150GB+的跟踪文件，从时间和空间角度进行系统性分析。

Result: 提炼出六个关键洞察指导未来服务系统设计，以晶圆级GPU为例，通过基于洞察的架构修改在DeepSeek V3和Qwen3上分别实现6.3倍和4.0倍平均加速。

Conclusion: 这是首个大规模MoE模型的数据中心分析工作，提供了全面的数据移动分析框架和公开数据集，为未来研究奠定基础。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) with Mixture of Experts (MoE) architectures
achieve remarkable performance improvements, but their random expert selection
mechanism introduces significant data movement overhead that becomes the
dominant bottleneck in multi-unit serving systems. To forecast the patterns
underlying this data movement, we conduct comprehensive data-movement-centric
profiling across three state-of-the-art large-scale MoE models (200B- 671B)
using over 24,000 requests spanning diverse workloads. With the resulting
150GB+ trace files, we perform systematic analysis from both temporal and
spatial perspectives and distill six key insights to guide the design of
diverse future serving systems. Taking wafer-scale GPUs as a case study, we
demonstrate that minor architectural modifications leveraging our insights
achieve substantial performance gains, delivering 6.3X and 4.0X average
speedups on DeepSeek V3 and Qwen3, respectively. Our work provides the first
comprehensive data-centric analysis of MoE models at scale. Our profiling
traces and analysis results are publicly available at

*Filipp Sporykhin,Holger Homann*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: 该论文研究了高阶间断Galerkin方法在现代高性能计算架构上的性能表现，发现八阶方法在达到相同全局误差时比低阶方法更快，GPU在大规模模拟中表现优于CPU但能耗优势存在反弹效应。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究现代数值方法在高性能计算架构（包括多核CPU和GPU）上的性能表现，特别关注高阶方法的计算效率和能耗特性。

Method: 使用Kokkos库和MPI实现单源代码，在多种GPU系统上运行空间节点间断Galerkin方法（最高八阶）和时间Runge-Kutta方法（最高六阶），求解线性对流方程和等温欧拉方程。

Result: 高阶方法计算更快，八阶模拟比三、四阶快；GPU在大规模模拟（超过10^7自由度）中显著优于CPU；新GPU需要更大网格才能高效使用，导致能耗反弹效应。

Conclusion: 高阶间断Galerkin方法在现代硬件上表现优异，但GPU的能耗优势受到网格规模影响，新GPU需要更大模拟规模才能发挥效率，这可能导致能耗反弹。

Abstract: This work discusses the performance of a modern numerical scheme for fluid
dynamical problems on modern high-performance computing architectures. Our code
implements a spatial nodal discontinuous Galerkin scheme that we test up to an
order of convergence of eight. It is temporally coupled to a set of Runge-Kutta
methods of orders up to six. The code integrates the linear advection equations
as well as the isothermal Euler equations in one, two, and three dimensions. In
order to target modern hardware involving many-core Central Processing Units
and accelerators such as Graphic Processing Units we use the Kokkos library in
conjunction with the Message Passing Interface to run our single source code on
various GPU systems. We find that the higher the order the faster is the code.
Eighth-order simulations attain a given global error with much less computing
time than third- or fourth-order simulations. The RK scheme has a smaller
impact on the code performance and a classical fourth-order scheme seems to
generally be a good choice. The code performs very well on all considered GPUs.
The many-CPU performance is also very good and perfect weak scaling is observed
up to many hundreds of CPU cores using MPI. We note that small grid-size
simulations are faster on CPUs than on GPUs while GPUs win significantly over
CPUs for simulations involving more than $10^7$ degrees of freedom ($\approx
3100^2$ grid points). When it comes to the environmental impact of numerical
simulations we estimate that GPUs consume less energy than CPUs for large
grid-size simulations but more energy on small grids. We observe a tendency
that the more modern is the GPU the larger needs to be the grid in order to use
it efficiently. This yields a rebound effect because larger simulations need
longer computing times and in turn more energy that is not compensated by the
energy efficiency gain of the newer GPUs.

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: 论文分析了当前快照/恢复机制在支持LLM智能体探索时的不足，指出了三个根本性挑战：分支语义、外部副作用和原生分叉。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的通用快照/恢复工具（如CRIU或容器提交）在支持LLM智能体的分支、回溯和多路径搜索时性能不足，特别是在真实部署环境中与其他智能体和用户共享资源时表现更差。

Method: 通过对六种快照/恢复机制进行基准测试，评估它们在隔离测试环境和真实部署环境中的表现。

Result: 测试结果显示通用工具即使在隔离环境中也不够快，在真实部署环境中完全失效，无法有效支持智能体探索。

Conclusion: 需要解决三个根本挑战：分支语义（如何处理暂定更新）、外部副作用（如何使服务支持分叉感知）、原生分叉（如何在微秒级克隆数据库和运行时而不进行批量复制）。

Abstract: Agentic exploration, letting LLM-powered agents branch, backtrack, and search
across many execution paths, demands systems support well beyond today's
pass-at-k resets. Our benchmark of six snapshot/restore mechanisms shows that
generic tools such as CRIU or container commits are not fast enough even in
isolated testbeds, and they crumble entirely in real deployments where agents
share files, sockets, and cloud APIs with other agents and human users. In this
talk, we pinpoint three open fundamental challenges: fork semantics, which
concerns how branches reveal or hide tentative updates; external side-effects,
where fork awareness must be added to services or their calls intercepted; and
native forking, which requires cloning databases and runtimes in microseconds
without bulk copying.

*Zhiyuan Ren,Tao Zhang,Wenchi Chen*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: 该论文提出了确定性因果结构(DCS)，这是一个将正确性与策略解耦的形式化基础，解决了分布式系统中性能驱动策略演进可能破坏完整性保证的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在分布式多智能体系统中，正确性常与调度、批处理、路由等操作策略纠缠在一起，导致系统脆弱，因为性能驱动的策略演进可能破坏完整性保证。

Method: 开发了一个最小化的公理理论，证明了四个结果：存在性和唯一性、策略无关不变性、观测等价性和公理最小性。

Result: DCS解决了基于值的收敛模型(如CRDTs)无法处理的因果模糊性问题，并表明移除任何公理都会使确定性崩溃为模糊性。

Conclusion: DCS作为异步计算的边界原则，确立了正确性作为固定、策略无关的底层基础，形成了"正确性即底盘"的范式，可在其上模块化、安全且可演进地构建分布式智能系统。

Abstract: In distributed multi-agent systems, correctness is often entangled with
operational policies such as scheduling, batching, or routing, which makes
systems brittle since performance-driven policy evolution may break integrity
guarantees. This paper introduces the Deterministic Causal Structure (DCS), a
formal foundation that decouples correctness from policy. We develop a minimal
axiomatic theory and prove four results: existence and uniqueness,
policy-agnostic invariance, observational equivalence, and axiom minimality.
These results show that DCS resolves causal ambiguities that value-centric
convergence models such as CRDTs cannot address, and that removing any axiom
collapses determinism into ambiguity. DCS thus emerges as a boundary principle
of asynchronous computation, analogous to CAP and FLP: correctness is preserved
only within the expressive power of a join-semilattice. All guarantees are
established by axioms and proofs, with only minimal illustrative constructions
included to aid intuition. This work establishes correctness as a fixed,
policy-agnostic substrate, a Correctness-as-a-Chassis paradigm, on which
distributed intelligent systems can be built modularly, safely, and evolvably.

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: 提出了时间流动性溢价(TLP)概念，为时间绑定稳定币建立无套利定价模型和动态风险控制机制，通过调整LTV比率来管理跨市场流动性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统证券市场闭市期间的流动性问题，通过时间绑定稳定币实现跨市场连续流动性，减少时间维度的市场低效率。

Method: 结合金融工程（无套利条件、期权式定价）和实证金融（交叉上市股票和期货的事件研究），建立定价模型和动态LTV调整机制。

Result: TLP随闭市时间和波动率增加而增长，但可通过自适应LTV控制；提供了回测结果和可视化分析。

Conclusion: 时间绑定稳定币是减少时间维度市场低效的有效工具，为未来研究和部署提供了理论框架。

Abstract: Time-bound stablecoins are DeFi assets that temporarily tokenize traditional
securities during market off-hours, enabling continuous cross-market liquidity.
We introduce the Liquidity-of-Time Premium (TLP): the extra return or cost of
providing liquidity when the primary market is closed. We build a no-arbitrage
pricing model that yields a band for fair values over different expiries, and a
dynamic risk-control mechanism that adjusts loan-to-value (LTV) ratios in real
time to keep TLP within a target range. Our analysis blends financial
engineering (no-arbitrage conditions, option-style pricing) with empirical
finance (event studies on cross-listed stocks and futures) to measure TLP under
time-zone frictions. We define TLP formally, derive closed-form expressions for
its term structure under idealized assumptions, and simulate scenarios that
vary volatility and collateralization. We then propose an LTV policy that
raises or lowers collateral to expand or curtail time-bound stablecoin supply,
analogous to a central bank adjusting rates to defend a peg. We outline
empirical proxies for TLP, including ADR premiums, overseas index futures
versus cash index divergence, and pre-market versus official close gaps.
Results show that TLP grows with closure length and volatility, yet can be
contained by adaptive LTV. We provide backtests and figures (term-structure
curves, capital-efficiency versus tail-risk trade-offs, time-liquidity
heatmaps) and discuss protocol design (vault structure, closing-price oracles,
on-chain auction liquidations). The findings position time-bound stablecoins as
a tool to reduce temporal market inefficiencies and inform future research and
deployment.

Abstract: Exponential growth in heterogeneous healthcare data arising from electronic
health records (EHRs), medical imaging, wearable sensors, and biomedical
research has accelerated the adoption of data lakes and centralized
architectures capable of handling the Volume, Variety, and Velocity of Big Data
for advanced analytics. However, without effective governance, these
repositories risk devolving into disorganized data swamps. Ontology-driven
semantic data management offers a robust solution by linking metadata to
healthcare knowledge graphs, thereby enhancing semantic interoperability,
improving data discoverability, and enabling expressive, domain-aware access.
This review adopts a systematic research strategy, formulating key research
questions and conducting a structured literature search across major academic
databases, with selected studies analyzed and classified into six categories of
ontology-driven healthcare analytics: (i) ontology-driven integration
frameworks, (ii) semantic modeling for metadata enrichment, (iii)
ontology-based data access (OBDA), (iv) basic semantic data management, (v)
ontology-based reasoning for decision support, and (vi) semantic annotation for
unstructured data. We further examine the integration of ontology technologies
with Big Data frameworks such as Hadoop, Spark, Kafka, and so on, highlighting
their combined potential to deliver scalable and intelligent healthcare
analytics. For each category, recent techniques, representative case studies,
technical and organizational challenges, and emerging trends such as artificial
intelligence, machine learning, the Internet of Things (IoT), and real-time
analytics are reviewed to guide the development of sustainable, interoperable,
and high-performance healthcare data ecosystems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 代理强化学习在LLM后训练中面临两个实际瓶颈：上下文长度快速增长导致内存使用增加和延迟，以及中间张量积累导致跨设备数据移动成为系统瓶颈。

Method: EARL设计了并行度选择器，根据序列长度和系统负载动态调整模型和训练并行度，以及数据分发器执行布局感知的分散式中间数据批次交换。

Result: 该系统提高了吞吐量，减少了长上下文失败，并实现了代理LLM的稳定大规模训练，无需依赖上下文长度的硬限制或惩罚。

Conclusion: EARL通过创新的并行度选择和数据分发机制，有效解决了代理强化学习中的可扩展性问题，为大规模代理LLM训练提供了稳定高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has become a pivotal component of large language
model (LLM) post-training, and agentic RL extends this paradigm to operate as
agents through multi-turn interaction and tool use. Scaling such systems
exposes two practical bottlenecks: (1) context length grows rapidly during
training, inflating memory usage and latency, and triggering out-of-memory
(OOM) failures; and (2) intermediate tensors accumulate with context length,
making cross-device data movement a major system bottleneck.
  We present EARL, a scalable system for efficient agentic RL. EARL designs a
parallelism selector that dynamically adapts model and training parallelism
across RL stages based on sequence length and system load, and a data
dispatcher that performs layout-aware, decentralized exchange of intermediate
data batches. Together, these components increase throughput, reduce
long-context failures, and enable stable large-scale training of agentic LLMs
without relying on hard limits or penalties of context length.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合类型2模糊集、粒计算和聚类的新框架，用于提升大数据环境中的可解释性和公平性，在空气质量数据集上表现出优于基线的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着机器学习模型在环境监测等领域的复杂性增加，需要可解释性和公平性来促进信任、伦理考量和法规遵从。传统黑盒模型缺乏透明度，而事后XAI技术常常牺牲准确性或无法提供内在洞察。

Method: 结合类型2模糊集、粒计算和聚类的新框架，包含类型2模糊聚类方法、公平性度量集成和基于规则的XAI组件。

Result: 在UCI空气质量数据集上，类型2模糊聚类相比类型1方法提升约4%的凝聚度（轮廓系数0.365 vs 0.349），改善公平性（熵0.918），规则覆盖率达0.65，运行时间线性增长（约0.005秒）。

Conclusion: 所提方法在可解释性、公平性和效率方面优于DBSCAN和凝聚聚类等基线方法，实现了4%的轮廓系数提升和高达1%的熵减少。

Abstract: The growing complexity of machine learning (ML) models in big data analytics,
especially in domains such as environmental monitoring, highlights the critical
need for interpretability and explainability to promote trust, ethical
considerations, and regulatory adherence (e.g., GDPR). Traditional "black-box"
models obstruct transparency, whereas post-hoc explainable AI (XAI) techniques
like LIME and SHAP frequently compromise accuracy or fail to deliver inherent
insights. This paper presents a novel framework that combines type-2 fuzzy
sets, granular computing, and clustering to boost explainability and fairness
in big data environments. When applied to the UCI Air Quality dataset, the
framework effectively manages uncertainty in noisy sensor data, produces
linguistic rules, and assesses fairness using silhouette scores and entropy.
Key contributions encompass: (1) A type-2 fuzzy clustering approach that
enhances cohesion by about 4% compared to type-1 methods (silhouette 0.365 vs.
0.349) and improves fairness (entropy 0.918); (2) Incorporation of fairness
measures to mitigate biases in unsupervised scenarios; (3) A rule-based
component for intrinsic XAI, achieving an average coverage of 0.65; (4)
Scalable assessments showing linear runtime (roughly 0.005 seconds for sampled
big data sizes). Experimental outcomes reveal superior performance relative to
baselines such as DBSCAN and Agglomerative Clustering in terms of
interpretability, fairness, and efficiency. Notably, the proposed method
achieves a 4% improvement in silhouette score over type-1 fuzzy clustering and
outperforms baselines in fairness (entropy reduction by up to 1%) and
efficiency.

Motivation: Transformer模型在金融应用中日益流行，但其风险决策和偏见尚未充分探索。本文旨在审计模型对波动性数据的依赖，并量化价格变动频率对模型预测置信度的影响。

Method: 使用Transformer模型进行预测，并引入基于偏信息分解(PID)的指标来衡量每个资产对模型决策的影响。

Result: 分析揭示两个关键发现：模型完全忽略数据波动性，且偏向低频价格变动数据。

Conclusion: Transformer模型在金融预测中存在对数据波动性不敏感和频率偏见的风险，需要进一步关注和优化。

Abstract: Transformer models have become increasingly popular in financial
applications, yet their potential risk making and biases remain under-explored.
The purpose of this work is to audit the reliance of the model on volatile data
for decision-making, and quantify how the frequency of price movements affects
the model's prediction confidence. We employ a transformer model for
prediction, and introduce a metric based on Partial Information Decomposition
(PID) to measure the influence of each asset on the model's decision making.
Our analysis reveals two key observations: first, the model disregards data
volatility entirely, and second, it is biased toward data with lower-frequency
price movements.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究网络环境中攻击者与防御者之间的对抗性强化学习，模拟真实的网络安全权衡，包括背景流量噪声、渐进式利用机制和蜜罐陷阱等。

Method: 使用深度Q网络(DQN)在零和奖励框架下训练竞争性攻击者和防御者智能体，通过系统评估不同配置（陷阱检测概率、利用难度阈值等）来研究对抗性学习。

Result: 实验表明防御者始终在50,000+训练回合中保持战略优势，特别是在复杂防御策略（自适应IP阻断和端口特定控制）下性能增益更加明显。

Conclusion: 零和公式和真实操作约束使该环境适用于研究自主防御系统、攻击者-防御者共同进化以及向现实网络安全场景的迁移学习。

Abstract: This paper presents a controlled study of adversarial reinforcement learning
in network security through a custom OpenAI Gym environment that models
brute-force attacks and reactive defenses on multi-port services. The
environment captures realistic security trade-offs including background traffic
noise, progressive exploitation mechanics, IP-based evasion tactics, honeypot
traps, and multi-level rate-limiting defenses. Competing attacker and defender
agents are trained using Deep Q-Networks (DQN) within a zero-sum reward
framework, where successful exploits yield large terminal rewards while
incremental actions incur small costs. Through systematic evaluation across
multiple configurations (varying trap detection probabilities, exploitation
difficulty thresholds, and training regimens), the results demonstrate that
defender observability and trap effectiveness create substantial barriers to
successful attacks. The experiments reveal that reward shaping and careful
training scheduling are critical for learning stability in this adversarial
setting. The defender consistently maintains strategic advantage across 50,000+
training episodes, with performance gains amplifying when exposed to complex
defensive strategies including adaptive IP blocking and port-specific controls.
Complete implementation details, reproducible hyperparameter configurations,
and architectural guidelines are provided to support future research in
adversarial RL for cybersecurity. The zero-sum formulation and realistic
operational constraints make this environment suitable for studying autonomous
defense systems, attacker-defender co-evolution, and transfer learning to
real-world network security scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于代理的优化方法只能收敛到单点解，限制了设计空间探索并忽略了有价值的替代拓扑结构，需要一种能生成多样化高性能设计组合的方法。

Method: 基于条件变分自编码器的框架，学习设计参数与性能之间的概率映射，能够根据特定性能目标生成多样化的高性能候选设计。

Result: 成功生成256个新颖设计，有效率为94.1%，其中77.2%的有效设计性能优于传统优化方法找到的单点最优解。

Conclusion: 生成式方法不仅能发现更高质量的解，还提供了丰富的多样化候选设计组合，从根本上增强了工程设计过程，支持多标准决策。

Abstract: Inverse design, which seeks to find optimal parameters for a target output,
is a central challenge in engineering. Surrogate-based optimization (SBO) has
become a standard approach, yet it is fundamentally structured to converge to a
single-point solution, thereby limiting design space exploration and ignoring
potentially valuable alternative topologies. This paper presents a paradigm
shift from single-point optimization to generative inverse design. We introduce
a framework based on a Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE) that learns a
probabilistic mapping between a system's design parameters and its performance,
enabling the generation of a diverse portfolio of high-performing candidates
conditioned on a specific performance objective. We apply this methodology to
the complex, non-linear problem of minimizing airfoil self-noise, using a
high-performing SBO method from a prior benchmark study as a rigorous baseline.
The CVAE framework successfully generated 256 novel designs with a 94.1\%
validity rate. A subsequent surrogate-based evaluation revealed that 77.2\% of
these valid designs achieved superior performance compared to the single
optimal design found by the SBO baseline. This work demonstrates that the
generative approach not only discovers higher-quality solutions but also
provides a rich portfolio of diverse candidates, fundamentally enhancing the
engineering design process by enabling multi-criteria decision-making.

fraud detection within digital banking, synthesizing evidence from 118
peer-reviewed studies and institutional reports. Following the PRISMA
guidelines, the review applied a structured identification, screening,
eligibility, and inclusion process to ensure methodological rigor and
transparency. The findings reveal that supervised learning methods, such as
decision trees, logistic regression, and support vector machines, remain the
dominant paradigm due to their interpretability and established performance,
while unsupervised anomaly detection approaches are increasingly adopted to
address novel fraud patterns in highly imbalanced datasets. Deep learning
architectures, particularly recurrent and convolutional neural networks, have
emerged as transformative tools capable of modeling sequential transaction data
and detecting complex fraud typologies, though challenges of interpretability
and real-time deployment persist. Hybrid models that combine supervised,
unsupervised, and deep learning strategies demonstrate superior adaptability
and detection accuracy, highlighting their potential as convergent solutions.

*Eric Jahns,Davi Moreno,Milan Stojkov,Michel A. Kinsy*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了首个针对高性能深度脉冲神经网络的QIF神经元模型离散化方法，通过分析其动力学特性并推导出稳定的训练梯度窗口，在多个数据集上超越了基于LIF的现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LIF神经元虽然计算效率高但表达能力有限，而QIF等复杂模型具有更丰富的非线性动力学特性，但由于训练不稳定而应用受限。

Method: 开发了QIF神经元模型的离散化版本，通过分析动力学特性推导出基于参数集的代理梯度窗口，以最小化梯度失配并确保训练稳定性。

Result: 在CIFAR-10、CIFAR-100、ImageNet和CIFAR-10 DVS等数据集上的评估表明，该方法能够超越基于LIF的最先进方法。

Conclusion: QIF神经元的离散化版本为深度SNN提供了一个有吸引力的LIF替代方案，结合了更丰富的动力学特性和实际可扩展性。

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have emerged as energy-efficient alternatives
to traditional artificial neural networks, leveraging asynchronous and
biologically inspired neuron dynamics. Among existing neuron models, the Leaky
Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) neuron has become widely adopted in deep SNNs due to
its simplicity and computational efficiency. However, this efficiency comes at
the expense of expressiveness, as LIF dynamics are constrained to linear decay
at each timestep. In contrast, more complex models, such as the Quadratic
Integrate-and-Fire (QIF) neuron, exhibit richer, nonlinear dynamics but have
seen limited adoption due to their training instability. On that note, we
propose the first discretization of the QIF neuron model tailored for
high-performance deep spiking neural networks and provide an in-depth analysis
of its dynamics. To ensure training stability, we derive an analytical
formulation for surrogate gradient windows directly from our discretizations'
parameter set, minimizing gradient mismatch. We evaluate our method on
CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, ImageNet, and CIFAR-10 DVS, demonstrating its ability to
outperform state-of-the-art LIF-based methods. These results establish our
discretization of the QIF neuron as a compelling alternative to LIF neurons for
deep SNNs, combining richer dynamics with practical scalability.

*Haijin Xie,Gongquan Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出MADCN框架预测城市碳排放，结合多头注意力和深度交叉网络，使用SHAP解释模型，发现人口、城市规模等是主要影响因素，新质生产力、数字经济和AI技术也有显著减排作用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 新质生产力、数字经济和人工智能技术对促进城市可持续发展日益重要，需要研究这些技术因素对碳排放的影响机制。

Method: 提出多头注意力深度交叉网络(MADCN)框架，结合特征交互建模和注意力机制，使用SHAP进行可解释性分析，基于275个中国城市的面板数据。

Result: MADCN模型在测试集上表现优异(MSE=406,151.063, MAE=612.304, R²=0.991)，SHAP分析显示人口、城市规模、城镇化率和GDP影响最大，新质生产力、数字经济和AI技术也有显著减排效果。

Conclusion: 推进新质生产力发展、加强数字经济和加速AI技术开发能显著减少城市碳排放，政策制定者应将技术创新融入碳减排战略，特别是推广智能基础设施和部门数字化。

Abstract: New quality productive forces (NQPF), digital economy advancement, and
artificial intelligence (AI) technologies are becoming crucial for promoting
sustainable urban development. This study proposes a Multi-head Attention Deep
& Cross Network (MADCN) framework, combining feature interaction modeling and
attention mechanisms, to predict urban carbon emissions and investigate the
impacts of technological factors. The framework incorporates an interpretable
learning phase using SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) to assess the
contributions of different features. A panel dataset covering 275 Chinese
cities is utilized to test the MADCN model. Experimental results demonstrate
that the MADCN model achieves superior predictive performance compared to
traditional machine learning and deep learning baselines, with a Mean Squared
Error (MSE) of 406,151.063, a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 612.304, and an
R-squared value of 0.991 on the test set. SHAP analysis highlights that
population, city size, urbanization rate, and GDP are among the most
influential factors on carbon emissions, while NQPF, digital economy index, and
AI technology level also show meaningful but relatively moderate effects.
Advancing NQPF, strengthening the digital economy, and accelerating AI
technology development can significantly contribute to reducing urban carbon
emissions. Policymakers should prioritize integrating technological innovation
into carbon reduction strategies, particularly by promoting intelligent
infrastructure and enhancing digitalization across sectors, to effectively
achieve dual-carbon goals.

*Anushiya Arunan,Yan Qin,Xiaoli Li,U-Xuan Tan,H. Vincent Poor,Chau Yuen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出首个基于自监督预训练的电池容量估计模型，使用隐私友好的充电数据片段，通过片段相似性加权掩码输入重构学习通用表示，在领域偏移场景下比最佳基准模型降低31.9%测试误差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 电动汽车电池容量准确估计对缓解消费者担忧至关重要，但隐私法规和标注数据短缺限制了通用化模型的开发，现有自监督学习方法难以从隐私友好数据中有效学习。

Method: 使用片段相似性加权掩码输入重构的自监督预训练框架，结合对比学习捕获片段间高层相似性，然后进行相似性加权掩码重构，学习细粒度充电模式和高层关联关系。

Result: 模型在制造商和老化引起的分布偏移等挑战性领域偏移设置下，始终优于最先进基准，测试误差比最佳基准降低31.9%。

Conclusion: 该自监督预训练框架能够从特征较少且嘈杂的隐私友好数据中学习丰富表示，为电池容量估计提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Accurate battery capacity estimation is key to alleviating consumer concerns
about battery performance and reliability of electric vehicles (EVs). However,
practical data limitations imposed by stringent privacy regulations and labeled
data shortages hamper the development of generalizable capacity estimation
models that remain robust to real-world data distribution shifts. While
self-supervised learning can leverage unlabeled data, existing techniques are
not particularly designed to learn effectively from challenging field data --
let alone from privacy-friendly data, which are often less feature-rich and
noisier. In this work, we propose a first-of-its-kind capacity estimation model
based on self-supervised pre-training, developed on a large-scale dataset of
privacy-friendly charging data snippets from real-world EV operations. Our
pre-training framework, snippet similarity-weighted masked input
reconstruction, is designed to learn rich, generalizable representations even
from less feature-rich and fragmented privacy-friendly data. Our key innovation
lies in harnessing contrastive learning to first capture high-level
similarities among fragmented snippets that otherwise lack meaningful context.
With our snippet-wise contrastive learning and subsequent similarity-weighted
masked reconstruction, we are able to learn rich representations of both
granular charging patterns within individual snippets and high-level
associative relationships across different snippets. Bolstered by this rich
representation learning, our model consistently outperforms state-of-the-art
baselines, achieving 31.9% lower test error than the best-performing benchmark,
even under challenging domain-shifted settings affected by both manufacturer
and age-induced distribution shifts.

TL;DR: 提出了Fast Causal Attention (FCA)算法，通过减少10%的操作来计算精确的因果注意力，加速了GPU上特殊矩阵乘法运算。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 因果注意力计算中存在大量上三角或下三角矩阵运算，这些运算在GPU上的默认实现效率不高，需要更优化的算法来加速训练和推理过程。

Method: 基于机器学习和组合搜索发现的代数恒等式，构建了FCA算法，专门优化一类特殊矩阵乘法（其中一个操作数或输出矩阵是上三角或下三角矩阵）。

Result: 在GPU上，FCA相比默认PyTorch实现和Triton编译内核实现了显著加速，特别是在因果注意力计算中的掩码乘积等操作上。

Conclusion: FCA为因果注意力计算提供了一种高效的精确计算方法，通过代数优化显著提升了GPU上的计算性能。

Abstract: We present Fast Causal Attention (FCA), an algorithm that computes exact
Causal Attention using 10\% fewer operations. FCA accelerates a special class
of matrix multiplications where either one operand or the output matrix is
upper- or lower-triangular. This includes all operations in forward and
backward pass of Causal Attention, such as masked product
$\mathrm{Mask}(QK^{T})$. For these matrix multiplications on GPU, FCA reaches
noticeable accelerations over the default PyTorch implementations and Triton
compiled kernels. FCA is built upon algebraic identities discovered via machine
learning and combinatorial search.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PatternKV是一种模式对齐残差量化方案，通过在线挖掘代表性模式向量、对齐KV向量并量化残差，有效改善低比特KV量化的保真度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: KV缓存已成为LLM推理中的主要内存和带宽瓶颈，特别是在长上下文和测试时扩展场景下。现有KV量化方法因原生KV分布不平坦而性能脆弱。

Method: 利用K缓存的稳定结构和V缓存的语义规律性，提出模式对齐残差量化：在线挖掘模式向量，对齐KV向量到最近模式，仅量化残差部分。

Result: 在多个骨干模型上，PatternKV在2比特设置下实现稳定增益，4比特下仅0.08%平均精度损失，测试时扩展精度提升10%，吞吐量提高1.4倍，支持1.25倍更大批次。

Conclusion: PatternKV通过重塑KV分布，有效解决了低比特KV量化的挑战，在保持精度的同时显著提升了推理效率。

Abstract: KV cache in autoregressive LLMs eliminates redundant recomputation but has
emerged as the dominant memory and bandwidth bottleneck during inference,
notably with long contexts and test-time scaling. KV quantization is a key
lever for reducing cache cost, but accuracy drops sharply as the native KV
distribution lacks flatness and thus maintains a wide quantization range. Prior
work focuses on isolating outliers, which caps their error but fails to flatten
the overall distribution, leaving performance fragile under low-bit settings.
In this work, we show that the K cache maintains a stable structure that
evolves gradually with context, while the V cache carries latent semantic
regularities. Building on these insights, we propose PatternKV, a
pattern-aligned residual quantization scheme. It mines representative pattern
vectors online, aligns each KV vector to its nearest pattern, and quantizes
only the residual. This reshaping of the KV distribution flattens the
quantization target and narrows its range, thereby improving the fidelity of
low-bit KV quantization. Across long-context and test-time scaling settings on
multiple backbones, PatternKV delivers consistent 2-bit gains, with a 0.08%
average 4-bit drop relative to FP16, improves test-time scaling accuracy by 10%
on average, and raises throughput by 1.4x while supporting 1.25x larger
batches.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出逻辑门控算子(LGO)，通过可学习的位置和陡度参数，在符号回归中实现可微分的阈值门控，生成具有明确单位感知阈值的紧凑符号方程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 符号回归虽然能生成可读方程，但难以编码单位感知的阈值和条件逻辑，限制了在临床等领域的实际应用。

Method: 使用逻辑门控算子(LGO)作为类型化原语，包含硬门控和软门控变体，可学习阈值位置和陡度，并映射回物理单位进行审计。

Result: 在两个健康数据集(ICU、NHANES)上，硬门控变体恢复了临床合理的切点：71%的评估阈值在指南锚点的10%范围内，100%在20%范围内，且使用更少的门控(ICU中位数4.0 vs 10.0；NHANES 5.0 vs 12.5)，同时保持与强基线相当的准确性。

Conclusion: 该方法将可解释性从后验解释转变为建模约束，为符号回归提供了实用的机制切换计算框架，适合治理就绪的部署。

Abstract: Symbolic regression promises readable equations but struggles to encode
unit-aware thresholds and conditional logic. We propose logistic-gated
operators (LGO) -- differentiable gates with learnable location and steepness
-- embedded as typed primitives and mapped back to physical units for audit.
Across two primary health datasets (ICU, NHANES), the hard-gate variant
recovers clinically plausible cut-points: 71% (5/7) of assessed thresholds fall
within 10% of guideline anchors and 100% within 20%, while using far fewer
gates than the soft variant (ICU median 4.0 vs 10.0; NHANES 5.0 vs 12.5), and
remaining within the competitive accuracy envelope of strong SR baselines. On
predominantly smooth tasks, gates are pruned, preserving parsimony. The result
is compact symbolic equations with explicit, unit-aware thresholds that can be
audited against clinical anchors -- turning interpretability from a post-hoc
explanation into a modeling constraint and equipping symbolic regression with a
practical calculus for regime switching and governance-ready deployment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在关键IoT环境中，传统IDS需要大量数据但面临隐私限制，联邦学习虽能保护隐私但仍面临数据异构性和高能耗问题。

Method: 在本地训练中应用剪枝技术减少模型复杂度，并设计定制化聚合方法处理非IID数据导致的剪枝模型差异。

Result: 在TON_IoT、X-IIoTID和IDSIoT2024三个数据集上的实验表明，OptiFLIDS在保持强检测性能的同时提高了能效。

Conclusion: OptiFLIDS适合在真实IoT环境中部署，平衡了检测性能和能源效率。

Abstract: In critical IoT environments, such as smart homes and industrial systems,
effective Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) are essential for ensuring
security. However, developing robust IDS solutions remains a significant
challenge. Traditional machine learning-based IDS models typically require
large datasets, but data sharing is often limited due to privacy and security
concerns. Federated Learning (FL) presents a promising alternative by enabling
collaborative model training without sharing raw data. Despite its advantages,
FL still faces key challenges, such as data heterogeneity (non-IID data) and
high energy and computation costs, particularly for resource constrained IoT
devices. To address these issues, this paper proposes OptiFLIDS, a novel
approach that applies pruning techniques during local training to reduce model
complexity and energy consumption. It also incorporates a customized
aggregation method to better handle pruned models that differ due to non-IID
data distributions. Experiments conducted on three recent IoT IDS datasets,
TON_IoT, X-IIoTID, and IDSIoT2024, demonstrate that OptiFLIDS maintains strong
detection performance while improving energy efficiency, making it well-suited
for deployment in real-world IoT environments.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于扩散模型的源分离方法，无需对源进行显式假设，仅利用多视图观测数据即可解决源分离问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统源分离方法依赖简化的源模型，无法准确复现数据。扩散模型可以直接从噪声、不完整数据中学习复杂先验分布，为源分离提供了新思路。

Method: 使用扩散模型，仅依赖多视图观测数据（不同观测包含未知源的不同线性变换），无需对源进行显式假设。方法在源未被单独观测、观测存在噪声、不完整和分辨率变化的情况下仍能工作。

Result: 方法在合成问题和真实星系观测中均表现出有效性，能够从源先验中采样、评估候选源概率，以及从给定观测的源分布联合后验中采样。

Conclusion: 扩散模型能够成功解决源分离问题，无需对源进行显式假设，且在各种具有挑战性的观测条件下都能工作。

Abstract: A common challenge in the natural sciences is to disentangle distinct,
unknown sources from observations. Examples of this source separation task
include deblending galaxies in a crowded field, distinguishing the activity of
individual neurons from overlapping signals, and separating seismic events from
an ambient background. Traditional analyses often rely on simplified source
models that fail to accurately reproduce the data. Recent advances have shown
that diffusion models can directly learn complex prior distributions from
noisy, incomplete data. In this work, we show that diffusion models can solve
the source separation problem without explicit assumptions about the source.
Our method relies only on multiple views, or the property that different sets
of observations contain different linear transformations of the unknown
sources. We show that our method succeeds even when no source is individually
observed and the observations are noisy, incomplete, and vary in resolution.
The learned diffusion models enable us to sample from the source priors,
evaluate the probability of candidate sources, and draw from the joint
posterior of the source distribution given an observation. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method on a range of synthetic problems as well as
real-world galaxy observations.

TL;DR: 该论文研究了神经网络权重矩阵集合在MNIST分类任务训练过程中的分布特性，使用具有置换对称性的高斯矩阵模型来建模权重分布，发现13参数置换不变高斯矩阵模型能有效描述权重相关性，并分析了训练过程中分布的变化。

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究神经网络权重矩阵在训练过程中的分布特性，测试高斯性和置换对称性假设下的矩阵模型对权重分布的表征能力，探索更通用且可解释的模型框架。

Method: 使用13参数置换不变高斯矩阵模型来建模神经网络权重矩阵的分布，通过表示论模型参数和图论特征化置换不变矩阵可观测量，计算Wasserstein距离量化训练过程中的分布变化。

Result: 发现置换不变高斯矩阵模型能有效描述权重矩阵的相关高斯性，远超简单独立同分布高斯模型的适用范围，特别是在初始化阶段之后。模型参数和可观测量提供了可解释的框架来理解最佳拟合模型和与高斯性的小偏差。

Conclusion: 置换不变高斯矩阵模型为神经网络权重分布提供了有效的建模框架，能够捕捉训练过程中的分布变化，并为开发更通用且高度可解释的模型奠定了基础。

Abstract: Ensembles of neural network weight matrices are studied through the training
process for the MNIST classification problem, testing the efficacy of matrix
models for representing their distributions, under assumptions of Gaussianity
and permutation-symmetry. The general 13-parameter permutation invariant
Gaussian matrix models are found to be effective models for the correlated
Gaussianity in the weight matrices, beyond the range of applicability of the
simple Gaussian with independent identically distributed matrix variables, and
notably well beyond the initialisation step. The representation theoretic model
parameters, and the graph-theoretic characterisation of the permutation
invariant matrix observables give an interpretable framework for the best-fit
model and for small departures from Gaussianity. Additionally, the Wasserstein
distance is calculated for this class of models and used to quantify the
movement of the distributions over training. Throughout the work, the effects
of varied initialisation regimes, regularisation, layer depth, and layer width
are tested for this formalism, identifying limits where particular departures
from Gaussianity are enhanced and how more general, yet still
highly-interpretable, models can be developed.

TL;DR: CMT-Benchmark是一个包含50个凝聚态理论专家级问题的数据集，用于评估LLMs在高级研究问题上的表现。结果表明前沿模型在所有问题上都表现不佳，最佳模型GPT5仅解决30%的问题，平均准确率为11.4%，凸显了当前LLMs在物理推理能力上的差距。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLMs在编程和数学问题解决方面取得了显著进展，但在硬科学领域的高级研究级问题评估仍然稀缺。为了填补这一空白，需要创建专家级难度的基准数据集来评估LLMs的物理推理能力。

Method: 通过全球专家小组协作设计50个凝聚态理论问题，涵盖量子多体和经典统计力学的分析和计算方法。开发了机器评分系统，包括通过正规排序处理非对易算子的符号处理。

Result: 前沿模型在所有问题上都表现挣扎，最佳模型GPT5仅解决30%的问题，17个模型的平均准确率为11.4±2.1%。18个问题没有被任何模型解决，26个问题最多被一个模型解决。未解决的问题主要涉及量子蒙特卡洛、变分蒙特卡洛和DMRG方法。

Conclusion: 该基准揭示了当前LLMs在物理推理技能上的显著差距，答案有时违反基本对称性或具有非物理标度维度。该基准将指导开发更强大的AI研究助手和导师。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable progress in coding and
math problem-solving, but evaluation on advanced research-level problems in
hard sciences remains scarce. To fill this gap, we present CMT-Benchmark, a
dataset of 50 problems covering condensed matter theory (CMT) at the level of
an expert researcher. Topics span analytical and computational approaches in
quantum many-body, and classical statistical mechanics. The dataset was
designed and verified by a panel of expert researchers from around the world.
We built the dataset through a collaborative environment that challenges the
panel to write and refine problems they would want a research assistant to
solve, including Hartree-Fock, exact diagonalization, quantum/variational Monte
Carlo, density matrix renormalization group (DMRG), quantum/classical
statistical mechanics, and model building. We evaluate LLMs by programmatically
checking solutions against expert-supplied ground truth. We developed
machine-grading, including symbolic handling of non-commuting operators via
normal ordering. They generalize across tasks too. Our evaluations show that
frontier models struggle with all of the problems in the dataset, highlighting
a gap in the physical reasoning skills of current LLMs. Notably, experts
identified strategies for creating increasingly difficult problems by
interacting with the LLMs and exploiting common failure modes. The best model,
GPT5, solves 30\% of the problems; average across 17 models (GPT, Gemini,
Claude, DeepSeek, Llama) is 11.4$\pm$2.1\%. Moreover, 18 problems are solved by
none of the 17 models, and 26 by at most one. These unsolved problems span
Quantum Monte Carlo, Variational Monte Carlo, and DMRG. Answers sometimes
violate fundamental symmetries or have unphysical scaling dimensions. We
believe this benchmark will guide development toward capable AI research
assistants and tutors.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一个统一的基准测试框架，用于系统评估图神经网络中消息传递与全局注意力机制的性能差异，发现在原子图学习中，编码器增强的MPNN形成了稳健基线，而融合局部-全局模型在长程交互效应主导的属性上表现最佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前图神经网络架构复杂性不断增加，但全局注意力机制相对于精心调优的消息传递层的实际优势尚不明确，主要由于实现、特征或超参数调优的不一致性。

Method: 基于HydraGNN构建了首个统一、可复现的基准测试框架，支持在四种受控模型类之间无缝切换：MPNN、带化学/拓扑编码器的MPNN、MPNN与全局注意力混合的GPS风格模型、以及带编码器的完全融合局部-全局模型。

Result: 使用七个不同的开源数据集进行回归和分类任务基准测试，系统分离了消息传递、全局注意力和编码器特征增强的贡献。编码器增强的MPNN形成了稳健基线，而融合局部-全局模型在长程交互效应主导的属性上表现最佳。

Conclusion: 这是对原子图学习中全局注意力的首次受控评估，建立了注意力精度-计算权衡的量化分析，并提供了未来模型开发的可复现测试平台。

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) are widely used as surrogates for costly
experiments and first-principles simulations to study the behavior of compounds
at atomistic scale, and their architectural complexity is constantly increasing
to enable the modeling of complex physics. While most recent GNNs combine more
traditional message passing neural networks (MPNNs) layers to model short-range
interactions with more advanced graph transformers (GTs) with global attention
mechanisms to model long-range interactions, it is still unclear when global
attention mechanisms provide real benefits over well-tuned MPNN layers due to
inconsistent implementations, features, or hyperparameter tuning. We introduce
the first unified, reproducible benchmarking framework - built on HydraGNN -
that enables seamless switching among four controlled model classes: MPNN, MPNN
with chemistry/topology encoders, GPS-style hybrids of MPNN with global
attention, and fully fused local - global models with encoders. Using seven
diverse open-source datasets for benchmarking across regression and
classification tasks, we systematically isolate the contributions of message
passing, global attention, and encoder-based feature augmentation. Our study
shows that encoder-augmented MPNNs form a robust baseline, while fused
local-global models yield the clearest benefits for properties governed by
long-range interaction effects. We further quantify the accuracy - compute
trade-offs of attention, reporting its overhead in memory. Together, these
results establish the first controlled evaluation of global attention in
atomistic graph learning and provide a reproducible testbed for future model
development.

TL;DR: 本文研究了参数错配的鞍点问题，提出两种基于加速原始对偶方法的算法，将优化和学习统一到一个框架中，收敛速率为O(logK/K)，学习感知版本具有更紧的常数项。


<details>

Motivation: 现有研究假设参数完全已知或预估计，但实际中参数需要从数据中学习。本文旨在将优化和学习集成到统一框架中，处理更灵活的问题类别。

Method: 基于Hamedani & Aybat 2021的加速原始对偶方法，提出两种算法：1) 直接将演化参数估计代入原始对偶更新的朴素扩展；2) 通过调整动量更新显式考虑参数动态的学习感知变体。

Result: 两种方法都实现了O(logK/K)的收敛速率，学习感知方法获得更紧的O(1)常数项，并通过回溯策略实现自适应步长选择。在结构化设置中，改进算法达到O(1/√K)速率。

Conclusion: 在错配投资组合优化问题上的实验表明，所提方法相比现有算法具有更优越的实证性能，验证了统一优化学习框架的有效性。

Abstract: We study a class of misspecified saddle point (SP) problems, where the
optimization objective depends on an unknown parameter that must be learned
concurrently from data. Unlike existing studies that assume parameters are
fully known or pre-estimated, our framework integrates optimization and
learning into a unified formulation, enabling a more flexible problem class. To
address this setting, we propose two algorithms based on the accelerated
primal-dual (APD) by Hamedani & Aybat 2021. In particular, we first analyze the
naive extension of the APD method by directly substituting the evolving
parameter estimates into the primal-dual updates; then, we design a new
learning-aware variant of the APD method that explicitly accounts for parameter
dynamics by adjusting the momentum updates. Both methods achieve a provable
convergence rate of $\mathcal{O}(\log K / K)$, while the learning-aware
approach attains a tighter $\mathcal{O}(1)$ constant and further benefits from
an adaptive step-size selection enabled by a backtracking strategy.
Furthermore, we extend the framework to problems where the learning problem
admits multiple optimal solutions, showing that our modified algorithm for a
structured setting achieves an $\mathcal{O}(1/\sqrt{K})$ rate. To demonstrate
practical impact, we evaluate our methods on a misspecified portfolio
optimization problem and show superior empirical performance compared to
state-of-the-art algorithms.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Lipschitz常数是衡量神经网络对输入扰动鲁棒性的关键指标，但精确计算是NP难问题，现有方法计算效率低且难以利用局部信息获得更紧的边界。

Method: 开发了广义SDP框架，支持异质激活函数和任意子网络选择；将该SDP分解为线性复杂度的小子问题序列；开发了基于闭式解的快速计算变体；提出了结合局部信息的ECLipsE-Gen-Local算法。

Result: 实验表明算法相比基准方法实现了显著加速，产生的Lipschitz边界比全局方法更紧，当输入区域足够小时能接近自动微分的精确Jacobian值，且Lipschitz估计与网络鲁棒性高度一致。

Conclusion: 提出的组合式框架提供了可扩展且紧的Lipschitz估计，有效解决了现有方法的计算瓶颈，为神经网络鲁棒性认证提供了实用工具。

Abstract: The Lipschitz constant is a key measure for certifying the robustness of
neural networks to input perturbations. However, computing the exact constant
is NP-hard, and standard approaches to estimate the Lipschitz constant involve
solving a large matrix semidefinite program (SDP) that scales poorly with
network size. Further, there is a potential to efficiently leverage local
information on the input region to provide tighter Lipschitz estimates. We
address this problem here by proposing a compositional framework that yields
tight yet scalable Lipschitz estimates for deep feedforward neural networks.
Specifically, we begin by developing a generalized SDP framework that is highly
flexible, accommodating heterogeneous activation function slope, and allowing
Lipschitz estimates with respect to arbitrary input-output pairs and arbitrary
choices of sub-networks of consecutive layers. We then decompose this
generalized SDP into a sequence of small sub-problems, with computational
complexity that scales linearly with respect to the network depth. We also
develop a variant that achieves near-instantaneous computation through
closed-form solutions to each sub-problem. All our algorithms are accompanied
by theoretical guarantees on feasibility and validity. Next, we develop a
series of algorithms, termed as ECLipsE-Gen-Local, that effectively incorporate
local information on the input. Our experiments demonstrate that our algorithms
achieve substantial speedups over a multitude of benchmarks while producing
significantly tighter Lipschitz bounds than global approaches. Moreover, we
show that our algorithms provide strict upper bounds for the Lipschitz constant
with values approaching the exact Jacobian from autodiff when the input region
is small enough. Finally, we demonstrate the practical utility of our approach
by showing that our Lipschitz estimates closely align with network robustness.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文通过消融研究比较了编码器专用和解码器专用模型在跨模态适应中的表现，发现解码器模型表现较差且扩展无益。作者提出了两种新方法（并行翻转和序列加倍）来改善解码器模型性能，缩小了与编码器模型的差距。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管解码器专用模型在NLP领域表现优异且扩展性好，但大多数跨模态适应方法都专注于编码器专用模型。本文旨在研究模型架构如何影响跨模态适应方法，特别是针对基于偏微分方程的时间相关模拟任务。

Method: 进行了一系列消融研究，系统比较编码器专用和解码器专用模型在跨模态适应中的表现。提出了两种新方法：并行翻转和序列加倍，试图在自回归模型中模拟双向性。

Result: 发现当现有方法未经修改时，解码器专用模型的表现远不如编码器专用模型。与多个其他领域不同，扩展解码器模型也无济于事。提出的两种新方法在所有任务和所有跨模型适应方法中都提高了解码器专用模型的整体性能，缩小了与编码器专用模型性能的差距。

Conclusion: 本文的研究发现拓宽了用于跨模态适应任务的模型范围，有望进一步推动科学机器学习的发展。提出的方法成功改善了解码器模型在跨模态适应中的表现。

Abstract: Large language models have shown great success on natural language tasks in
recent years, but they have also shown great promise when adapted to new
modalities, e.g., for scientific machine learning tasks. Even though
decoder-only models are more popular within NLP and scale exceedingly well at
generating natural language, most proposed approaches for cross-modal
adaptation focus on encoder-only models, raising the question of how model
architecture affects these approaches. In this paper, we therefore perform a
series of ablation studies to answer this question, systematically comparing
encoder-only and decoder-only models on cross-modal adaptation for
time-dependent simulation tasks based on partial differential equations (PDEs).
We find that decoder-only models are far worse than encoder-only models, when
existing approaches are applied unmodified. In contrast to several other
domains, scaling decoder-only models also does not help. To harness the
potential of decoder-only models in this context, we introduce two novel
approaches, Parallel Flipping and Sequence Doubling, attempting to mimic
bidirectionality in autoregressive models. Both our methods improve overall
performance using decoder-only models for all tasks and all cross-model
adaptation methods, closing the gap to encoder-only model performance. We hope
that our findings broaden the spectrum of models used on cross-modal adaptation
tasks to further scientific ML.

*Rui Lin,Yiwen Zhang,Zhicheng Peng,Minghao Lyu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出Action Gradient方法来解决Decision Transformer在离线强化学习中的轨迹拼接和动作外推问题，通过直接调整动作来替代策略梯度方法，显著提升DT算法性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Decision Transformer将强化学习与Transformer结合，但面临轨迹拼接和动作外推两大挑战。现有方法单独解决这些问题但组合时性能不稳定。

Method: 提出Action Gradient方法，利用Q值对动作的梯度来优化动作，实现与策略梯度类似的功能，并能与token预测技术高效集成。

Result: 实证结果表明该方法能显著提升DT基算法的性能，部分结果达到最先进水平。

Conclusion: Action Gradient方法有效解决了DT的挑战，为离线强化学习提供了稳定高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Decision Transformer (DT), which integrates reinforcement learning (RL) with
the transformer model, introduces a novel approach to offline RL. Unlike
classical algorithms that take maximizing cumulative discounted rewards as
objective, DT instead maximizes the likelihood of actions. This paradigm shift,
however, presents two key challenges: stitching trajectories and extrapolation
of action. Existing methods, such as substituting specific tokens with
predictive values and integrating the Policy Gradient (PG) method, address
these challenges individually but fail to improve performance stably when
combined due to inherent instability. To address this, we propose Action
Gradient (AG), an innovative methodology that directly adjusts actions to
fulfill a function analogous to that of PG, while also facilitating efficient
integration with token prediction techniques. AG utilizes the gradient of the
Q-value with respect to the action to optimize the action. The empirical
results demonstrate that our method can significantly enhance the performance
of DT-based algorithms, with some results achieving state-of-the-art levels.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究深度神经网络中图结构的挫折水平，以了解网络的结构平衡程度和功能行为特征。

Method: 通过计算深度卷积神经网络对应符号图的挫折水平，并与零模型进行比较分析。

Result: 所有预训练的深度卷积神经网络都显示出比零模型更低的挫折水平，表明网络更有序，表现出近单调行为。

Conclusion: 深度卷积神经网络倾向于表现出比预期更有序的行为，这暗示了一种新的隐式正则化机制。

Abstract: For the signed graph associated to a deep neural network, one can compute the
frustration level, i.e., test how close or distant the graph is to structural
balance. For all the pretrained deep convolutional neural networks we consider,
we find that the frustration is always less than expected from null models.
From a statistical physics point of view, and in particular in reference to an
Ising spin glass model, the reduced frustration indicates that the amount of
disorder encoded in the network is less than in the null models. From a
functional point of view, low frustration (i.e., proximity to structural
balance) means that the function representing the network behaves
near-monotonically, i.e., more similarly to a monotone function than in the
null models. Evidence of near-monotonic behavior along the partial order
determined by frustration is observed for all networks we consider. This
confirms that the class of deep convolutional neural networks tends to have a
more ordered behavior than expected from null models, and suggests a novel form
of implicit regularization.

Motivation: 解决大型语言模型的两个安全关切：1）传统LLM硬件要求高，无法在消费级设备本地运行，依赖远程连接易受网络攻击；2）敏感任务微调涉及敏感数据，非私有微调算法易受训练数据再现攻击。

Method: 引入可适应梯度裁剪和其他工程增强到标准DP-Adam优化器，创建DP-Adam-AC优化器，用于微调两种本地化LLM设计：小语言模型(Qwen2.5-0.5B)和1.58位量化模型(Bitnet-b1.58-2B)。

Conclusion: 通过增强差分隐私优化算法和本地化语言模型，有效解决了LLM的网络安全和数据隐私安全问题，为安全敏感场景下的LLM应用提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT have evolved into powerful and
ubiquitous tools. Fine-tuning on small datasets allows LLMs to acquire
specialized skills for specific tasks efficiently. Although LLMs provide great
utility in both general and task-specific use cases, they are limited by two
security-related concerns. First, traditional LLM hardware requirements make
them infeasible to run locally on consumer-grade devices. A remote network
connection with the LLM provider's server is usually required, making the
system vulnerable to network attacks. Second, fine-tuning an LLM for a
sensitive task may involve sensitive data. Non-private fine-tuning algorithms
produce models vulnerable to training data reproduction attacks. Our work
addresses these security concerns by enhancing differentially private
optimization algorithms and applying them to fine-tune localizable language
models. We introduce adaptable gradient clipping along with other engineering
enhancements to the standard DP-Adam optimizer to create DP-Adam-AC. We use our
optimizer to fine-tune examples of two localizable LLM designs, small language
model (Qwen2.5-0.5B) and 1.58 bit quantization (Bitnet-b1.58-2B). We
demonstrate promising improvements in loss through experimentation with two
synthetic datasets.

Abstract: We study the cosine similarity of sentence transformer embeddings and observe
that they are well modeled by gamma mixtures. From a fixed corpus, we measure
similarities between all document embeddings and a reference query embedding.
Empirically we find that these distributions are often well captured by a gamma
distribution shifted and truncated to [-1,1], and in many cases, by a gamma
mixture. We propose a heuristic model in which a hierarchical clustering of
topics naturally leads to a gamma-mixture structure in the similarity scores.
Finally, we outline an expectation-maximization algorithm for fitting shifted
gamma mixtures, which provides a practical tool for modeling similarity
distributions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统对抗训练中使用的均方误差正则化强制两个输出分布均匀优化，限制了鲁棒性。需要更灵活的优化方法来提升对抗训练效果。

Method: 1. 加权对抗互正则化：制定分解的对抗互KL散度损失，为主目标和辅助目标分配不等权重；2. 对抗泛化正则化：在对抗训练目标中引入额外的干净目标分布。

Result: 大量实验表明，所提方法相比现有正则化方法显著提高了对抗鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 提出的两种正则化策略有效解决了传统对抗训练中MSE正则化的局限性，通过更灵活的优化控制和引入干净目标分布，显著增强了模型鲁棒性。

Abstract: Adversarial training is the most effective defense against adversarial
attacks. The effectiveness of the adversarial attacks has been on the design of
its loss function and regularization term. The most widely used loss function
in adversarial training is cross-entropy and mean squared error (MSE) as its
regularization objective. However, MSE enforces overly uniform optimization
between two output distributions during training, which limits its robustness
in adversarial training scenarios. To address this issue, we revisit the idea
of mutual learning (originally designed for knowledge distillation) and propose
two novel regularization strategies tailored for adversarial training: (i)
weighted adversarial mutual regularization and (ii) adversarial generalization
regularization. In the former, we formulate a decomposed adversarial mutual
Kullback-Leibler divergence (KL-divergence) loss, which allows flexible control
over the optimization process by assigning unequal weights to the main and
auxiliary objectives. In the latter, we introduce an additional clean target
distribution into the adversarial training objective, improving generalization
and enhancing model robustness. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
proposed methods significantly improve adversarial robustness compared to
existing regularization-based approaches.

Motivation: 现代传感系统产生高维张量数据，需要既能保持张量几何结构又能捕捉非线性交互的回归模型，现有方法要么线性要么破坏结构

Method: 开发了张量对张量回归神经网络(TRNN)，统一了张量回归和神经网络两种范式

Result: 未在摘要中明确说明

Conclusion: TRNN模型成功统一了张量几何保持和非线性建模两个关键需求

Abstract: Modern sensing and metrology systems now stream terabytes of heterogeneous,
high-dimensional (HD) data profiles, images, and dense point clouds, whose
natural representation is multi-way tensors. Understanding such data requires
regression models that preserve tensor geometry, yet remain expressive enough
to capture the pronounced nonlinear interactions that dominate many industrial
and mechanical processes. Existing tensor-based regressors meet the first
requirement but remain essentially linear. Conversely, conventional neural
networks offer nonlinearity only after flattening, thereby discarding spatial
structure and incurring prohibitive parameter counts. This paper introduces a
Tensor-on-Tensor Regression Neural Network (TRNN) that unifies these two
paradigms.

TL;DR: MADPO是一种改进的直接偏好优化方法，通过实例级的自适应权重解决DPO固定温度参数的问题，在情感生成任务中显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统DPO方法使用固定温度参数，导致在多样化偏好数据上训练效果不佳——容易样本过拟合，而信息量大的样本学习不足。现有改进方法如IPO和β-DPO各有局限性。

Method: 采用两步法：首先训练奖励模型估计偏好边界，然后使用这些边界为每个训练样本的DPO损失应用连续自适应权重。这种重加权方案对困难样本放大学习信号，对容易样本减弱信号。

Result: 在情感生成任务中，MADPO在不同质量数据集上均显著优于基线方法，在高质量数据上性能提升达+33.3%，在低质量数据上提升+10.5%。

Conclusion: MADPO为偏好对齐提供了一种更稳健和原则性的方法，具有良好优化的理论保证和对奖励模型估计误差的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has emerged as a simple and effective
method for aligning large language models. However, its reliance on a fixed
temperature parameter leads to suboptimal training on diverse preference data,
causing overfitting on easy examples and under-learning from informative ones.
Recent methods have emerged to counter this. While IPO addresses general
overfitting, its uniform regularization can be overly conservative. The more
targeted approach of $\beta$-DPO suffers from its own limitations: its
batch-level adaptation applies a single, compromised temperature to
mixed-margin pairs, its linear update rule can produce unstable negative
$\beta$ values, and its filtering mechanism discards potentially useful
training signals. In this work, we introduce Margin-Adaptive Direct Preference
Optimization (MADPO), a method that provides a stable, data-preserving, and
instance-level solution. MADPO employs a practical two-step approach: it first
trains a reward model to estimate preference margins and then uses these
margins to apply a continuous, adaptive weight to the DPO loss for each
individual training sample. This re-weighting scheme creates an effective
target margin that is amplified for hard pairs and dampened for easy pairs,
allowing for granular control over the learning signal. We provide a
comprehensive theoretical analysis, proving that MADPO has a well-behaved
optimization landscape and is robust to reward model estimation errors. We
validate our theory with experiments on a sentiment generation task, where
MADPO consistently and significantly outperforms strong baselines across
datasets of varying quality. It achieves performance gains of up to +33.3\% on
High Quality data and +10.5\% on Low Quality data over the next-best method.
Our results establish MADPO as a more robust and principled approach to
preference alignment.

Conclusion: PIANO提供了一种有效且物理一致的解决方案，能够直接从2D边界条件准确重建3D磁场结构，在太阳物理研究中有重要应用价值。

Abstract: We propose Physics-informed Attention-enhanced Fourier Neural Operator

methods, our proposed PIANO directly learns the 3D magnetic field structure
from 2D boundary conditions. Specifically, PIANO integrates Efficient Channel
Attention (ECA) mechanisms with Dilated Convolutions (DC), which enhances the
model's ability to capture multimodal input by prioritizing critical channels
relevant to the magnetic field's variations. Furthermore, we apply
physics-informed loss by enforcing the force-free and divergence-free
conditions in the training process so that our prediction is consistent with
underlying physics with high accuracy. Experimental results on the ISEE NLFFF
dataset show that our PIANO not only outperforms state-of-the-art neural
operators in terms of accuracy but also shows strong consistency with the

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 分布式数据并行训练中频繁的梯度通信会饱和带宽，不频繁通信策略(如Local SGD)在自适应优化器上存在性能差距，这源于优化器动量与更新频率的时间尺度不匹配

Method: MT-DAO优化器采用多个快慢移动的一阶动量或梯度来跟踪不同时间尺度的更新动态，并提供了首个收敛保证

Result: 在语言模型预训练中消除了与DDP的性能差距，在以太网互连上减少了6-27%的等令牌墙钟时间，720M规模下达到目标困惑度所需的步骤减少24%，时间减少35%

Conclusion: MT-DAO实现了有效的跨数据中心训练和广域地理范围内的训练

Abstract: Training large models with distributed data parallelism (DDP) requires
frequent communication of gradients across workers, which can saturate
bandwidth. Infrequent communication strategies (e.g., Local SGD) reduce this
overhead but, when applied to adaptive optimizers, often suffer a performance
gap relative to fully synchronous DDP. We trace this gap to a time-scale
mismatch: the optimizer's fast-moving momentum, tuned for frequent updates,
decays too quickly to smooth gradients over long intervals, leading to
noise-dominated optimization. To address this, we propose MT-DAO, a family of
optimizers that employs multiple slow- and fast-moving first momenta or the
gradient to track update dynamics across different time scales, for which we
provide the first convergence guarantees. Empirically, for language-model
pre-training, this eliminates the performance gap with DDP, outperforming
infrequent-communication baselines in perplexity and reducing iso-token
wall-clock time by 6-27% on Ethernet interconnects. At the 720M scale, MT-DAO
reaches a target perplexity in 24% fewer steps and 35% less time than the
single-momentum DDP baseline. MT-DAO enables effective cross-datacenter
training and training over wide geographic areas.

TL;DR: KVLinC是一个用于缓解极低精度KV缓存量化引起注意力误差的框架，通过Hadamard旋转和线性校正适配器，在保持高压缩率的同时提升生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: KV缓存量化是提高大语言模型推理效率的有效策略，但极低精度量化（如2位）会在键值张量中引入显著误差，这些误差通过点积注意力机制传播，最终降低生成质量。

Method: KVLinC结合Hadamard旋转（减少值量化误差）和轻量级线性校正适配器（显式补偿量化键引入的误差），并实现自定义注意力内核。

Result: 在LLaMA、Qwen2.5和Qwen3模型家族上的广泛评估表明，KVLinC始终匹配或超越强基线，同时实现更高的KV缓存压缩，推理速度比Flash Attention基线快达2.55倍。

Conclusion: KVLinC框架有效解决了极低精度KV缓存量化带来的注意力误差问题，实现了高效的长期上下文LLM推理。

Abstract: Quantizing the key-value (KV) cache is a promising strategy for improving the
inference efficiency of large language models (LLMs). However, aggressive
quantization to very low precision (e.g., 2 bits) introduces significant errors
in the stored key and value tensors, which propagate through the dot-product
attention mechanism and ultimately degrade generation quality. To address this,
we propose KVLinC, a framework to mitigate attention errors introduced by KV
cache quantization in the extreme low-precision regime. KVLinC combines a
Hadamard rotation, which reduces quantization error in values, with lightweight
linear correction adapters that explicitly compensate for errors introduced by
quantized keys. Across extensive evaluations on the LLaMA, Qwen2.5, and Qwen3
model families, KVLinC consistently matches or surpasses strong baselines while
achieving higher KV-cache compression. Furthermore, we implement a custom
attention kernel that results in upto 2.55x faster inference compared to Flash
Attention baseline, enabling efficient long-context LLM inference.

Conclusion: S-Pformer通过消除编码器冗余和集成傅里叶特征嵌入，有效解决了PINNSformer的参数冗余和频谱偏差问题，在保持或提升性能的同时显著减少了模型复杂度。

Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) are a useful framework for
approximating partial differential equation solutions using deep learning
methods. In this paper, we propose a principled redesign of the PINNsformer, a
Transformer-based PINN architecture. We present the Spectral PINNSformer
(S-Pformer), a refinement of encoder-decoder PINNSformers that addresses two
key issues; 1. the redundancy (i.e. increased parameter count) of the encoder,
and 2. the mitigation of spectral bias. We find that the encoder is unnecessary
for capturing spatiotemporal correlations when relying solely on
self-attention, thereby reducing parameter count. Further, we integrate Fourier
feature embeddings to explicitly mitigate spectral bias, enabling adaptive
encoding of multiscale behaviors in the frequency domain. Our model outperforms
encoder-decoder PINNSformer architectures across all benchmarks, achieving or
outperforming MLP performance while reducing parameter count significantly.

Conclusion: 提出的随机特征神经网络方法能够有效估计KL散度，并提供了理论保证的实际算法性能。

Abstract: Estimating the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between random variables is a
fundamental problem in statistical analysis. For continuous random variables,
traditional information-theoretic estimators scale poorly with dimension and/or
sample size. To mitigate this challenge, a variety of methods have been
proposed to estimate KL divergences and related quantities, such as mutual
information, using neural networks. The existing theoretical analyses show that
neural network parameters achieving low error exist. However, since they rely
on non-constructive neural network approximation theorems, they do not
guarantee that the existing algorithms actually achieve low error. In this
paper, we propose a KL divergence estimation algorithm using a shallow neural
network with randomized hidden weights and biases (i.e. a random feature
method). We show that with high probability, the algorithm achieves a KL
divergence estimation error of $O(m^{-1/2}+T^{-1/3})$, where $m$ is the number
of neurons and $T$ is both the number of steps of the algorithm and the number
of samples.

Abstract: Accurate and efficient temperature prediction is critical for optimizing the
preheating process of PET preforms in industrial microwave systems prior to
blow molding. We propose a novel deep learning framework for generalized
temperature prediction. Unlike traditional models that require extensive
retraining for each material or design variation, our method introduces a
data-efficient neural architecture that leverages transfer learning and model
fusion to generalize across unseen scenarios. By pretraining specialized neural
regressor on distinct conditions such as recycled PET heat capacities or
varying preform geometries and integrating their representations into a unified
global model, we create a system capable of learning shared thermal dynamics
across heterogeneous inputs. The architecture incorporates skip connections to
enhance stability and prediction accuracy. Our approach reduces the need for
large simulation datasets while achieving superior performance compared to
models trained from scratch. Experimental validation on two case studies
material variability and geometric diversity demonstrates significant
improvements in generalization, establishing a scalable ML-based solution for
intelligent thermal control in manufacturing environments. Moreover, the
approach highlights how data-efficient generalization strategies can extend to
other industrial applications involving complex physical modeling with limited
data.

### [55] [Comparing LSTM-Based Sequence-to-Sequence Forecasting Strategies for 24-Hour Solar Proton Flux Profiles Using GOES Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05399)
*Kangwoo Yi,Bo Shen,Qin Li,Haimin Wang,Yong-Jae Moon,Jaewon Lee,Hwanhee Lee*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文使用基于LSTM的序列到序列深度学习模型来预测太阳质子事件发生后24小时的质子通量时间剖面，通过多种预测场景比较发现：一次性预测优于自回归预测，趋势平滑数据能提升质子+X射线模型的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 太阳质子事件对卫星、宇航员和技术系统构成重大辐射危害，准确预测质子通量时间剖面对于早期预警和缓解措施至关重要。

Method: 使用40个太阳质子事件数据集，基于LSTM的序列到序列模型，通过4折分层交叉验证评估不同配置，包括质子输入vs质子+X射线输入、原始通量数据vs趋势平滑数据、自回归vs一次性预测。

Result: 一次性预测比自回归预测误差更低；在原始数据上质子模型优于质子+X射线模型，但趋势平滑后差距缩小或逆转；趋势平滑显著提升质子+X射线模型性能；趋势平滑数据训练模型平均表现最佳，但最佳模型来自原始数据训练。

Conclusion: LSTM序列到序列模型能有效预测太阳质子事件质子通量，一次性预测策略和适当的数据预处理能显著提升预测性能，但模型架构选择有时比数据预处理更重要。

Abstract: Solar Proton Events (SPEs) cause significant radiation hazards to satellites,
astronauts, and technological systems. Accurate forecasting of their proton
flux time profiles is crucial for early warnings and mitigation. This paper
explores deep learning sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) models based on Long
Short-Term Memory networks to predict 24-hour proton flux profiles following
SPE onsets. We used a dataset of 40 well-connected SPEs (1997-2017) observed by
NOAA GOES, each associated with a >=M-class western-hemisphere solar flare and
undisturbed proton flux profiles. Using 4-fold stratified cross-validation, we
evaluate seq2seq model configurations (varying hidden units and embedding
dimensions) under multiple forecasting scenarios: (i) proton-only input vs.
combined proton+X-ray input, (ii) original flux data vs. trend-smoothed data,
and (iii) autoregressive vs. one-shot forecasting. Our major results are as
follows: First, one-shot forecasting consistently yields lower error than
autoregressive prediction, avoiding the error accumulation seen in iterative
approaches. Second, on the original data, proton-only models outperform
proton+X-ray models. However, with trend-smoothed data, this gap narrows or
reverses in proton+X-ray models. Third, trend-smoothing significantly enhances
the performance of proton+X-ray models by mitigating fluctuations in the X-ray
channel. Fourth, while models trained on trendsmoothed data perform best on
average, the best-performing model was trained on original data, suggesting
that architectural choices can sometimes outweigh the benefits of data
preprocessing.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为NoiseCurve的技术，利用公开无标签数据估计的模型曲率来改进DP-SGD中的跨迭代噪声相关性，显著提高了差分隐私训练的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前DP-SGD与普通SGD训练存在较大的准确性差距，需要改进隐私保护训练方法。DP-MF方法通过关联不同迭代的隐私噪声来抵消部分噪声，但噪声相关性质量有待提升。

Method: 使用公开无标签数据估计模型曲率，基于此改进DP-MF中的跨迭代噪声相关性，提出NoiseCurve技术。

Result: 在多个数据集、模型和隐私参数上的实验表明，NoiseCurve计算的噪声相关性相比DP-MF的相关方案带来了持续且显著的准确性提升。

Conclusion: NoiseCurve技术通过利用模型曲率信息改进噪声相关性，有效提升了差分隐私随机梯度下降的准确性表现。

Abstract: Differentially private stochastic gradient descent (DP-SGD) offers the
promise of training deep learning models while mitigating many privacy risks.
However, there is currently a large accuracy gap between DP-SGD and normal SGD
training. This has resulted in different lines of research investigating
orthogonal ways of improving privacy-preserving training. One such line of
work, known as DP-MF, correlates the privacy noise across different iterations
of stochastic gradient descent -- allowing later iterations to cancel out some
of the noise added to earlier iterations. In this paper, we study how to
improve this noise correlation. We propose a technique called NoiseCurve that
uses model curvature, estimated from public unlabeled data, to improve the
quality of this cross-iteration noise correlation. Our experiments on various
datasets, models, and privacy parameters show that the noise correlations
computed by NoiseCurve offer consistent and significant improvements in
accuracy over the correlation scheme used by DP-MF.

TL;DR: DVI是一种训练感知的自推测解码框架，通过将LLM划分为草稿器和验证器，在推理过程中进行持续在线学习，实现无损加速。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自回归解码是大型语言模型的主要延迟瓶颈。现有推测解码系统需要大量离线训练或额外组件，增加了数据/计算成本，且在分布漂移下可能导致脆弱的草稿器。

Method: 将LLM划分为草稿器和验证器，在生成过程中将验证器的接受/拒绝决策转化为监督信号来更新草稿器头。采用KL→RL调度，通过在线蒸馏引导校准，然后添加奖励掩码交叉熵和在线策略梯度项。

Result: 在Spec-Bench上实现2.16倍实时加速，与EAGLE-2等最先进方法相当，但训练数据量少几个数量级。消融实验显示DVI优于仅使用KL的在线蒸馏。

Conclusion: 训练感知的自推测可以在最小训练开销下提供最先进的无损加速。

Abstract: Autoregressive (AR) decoding is a major latency bottleneck for large language
models. Speculative decoding (SD) accelerates AR by letting a drafter propose
multi-token blocks that a verifier accepts or rejects. However, many SD systems
require heavy offline training or extra components. These choices raise
data/compute cost and can yield brittle drafters under distribution drift. We
introduce \emph{Draft, Verify, \& Improve (DVI)}, a training-aware
self-speculative framework that combines inference with continual online
learning. We partition an LLM into a drafter and a verifier, and during
generation, verifier accept/reject decisions are converted into supervision
signals and used to update the drafter head. A simple \emph{KL$\rightarrow$RL}
schedule bootstraps calibration via online distillation and then adds
reward-masked cross-entropy with a on-policy policy-gradient term, preserving
lossless, single model deployment. On Spec-Bench, DVI achieves a $2.16\times$
wall-time speedup, on par with SoTA approaches like EAGLE-2, while orders of
magnitude less data for training, and ablations show that DVI outperforms
KL-only online distillation. DVI demonstrates that \emph{training-aware}
self-speculation can deliver state-of-the-art, lossless speedups with minimal
training overhead.

Abstract: Physics-informed machine learning (PIML) is emerging as a potentially
transformative paradigm for modeling complex biomedical systems by integrating
parameterized physical laws with data-driven methods. Here, we review three
main classes of PIML frameworks: physics-informed neural networks (PINNs),
neural ordinary differential equations (NODEs), and neural operators (NOs),
highlighting their growing role in biomedical science and engineering. We begin
with PINNs, which embed governing equations into deep learning models and have
been successfully applied to biosolid and biofluid mechanics, mechanobiology,
and medical imaging among other areas. We then review NODEs, which offer
continuous-time modeling, especially suited to dynamic physiological systems,
pharmacokinetics, and cell signaling. Finally, we discuss deep NOs as powerful
tools for learning mappings between function spaces, enabling efficient
simulations across multiscale and spatially heterogeneous biological domains.
Throughout, we emphasize applications where physical interpretability, data
scarcity, or system complexity make conventional black-box learning
insufficient. We conclude by identifying open challenges and future directions
for advancing PIML in biomedical science and engineering, including issues of
uncertainty quantification, generalization, and integration of PIML and large
language models.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ARLAS框架通过对抗性强化学习训练LLM代理，使其能防御多样化的间接提示注入攻击，同时提高任务成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有防御方法依赖手动构建的攻击数据集，缺乏多样性，无法应对新型提示注入攻击，存在安全风险。

Method: 使用对抗性强化学习框架，将问题建模为双人零和博弈，同时训练攻击者生成多样化提示注入和代理防御这些攻击。

Result: 在BrowserGym和AgentDojo上的评估显示，ARLAS训练的代理攻击成功率显著降低，任务成功率提高。

Conclusion: 对抗性过程生成多样化且具有挑战性的攻击，相比基础模型产生更鲁棒的代理。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents can leverage tools such as Google Search to
complete complex tasks. However, this tool usage introduces the risk of
indirect prompt injections, where malicious instructions hidden in tool outputs
can manipulate the agent, posing security risks like data leakage. Current
defense strategies typically rely on fine-tuning LLM agents on datasets of
known attacks. However, the generation of these datasets relies on manually
crafted attack patterns, which limits their diversity and leaves agents
vulnerable to novel prompt injections. To address this limitation, we propose
Adversarial Reinforcement Learning for Agent Safety (ARLAS), a novel framework
that leverages adversarial reinforcement learning (RL) by formulating the
problem as a two-player zero-sum game. ARLAS co-trains two LLMs: an attacker
that learns to autonomously generate diverse prompt injections and an agent
that learns to defend against them while completing its assigned tasks. To
ensure robustness against a wide range of attacks and to prevent cyclic
learning, we employ a population-based learning framework that trains the agent
to defend against all previous attacker checkpoints. Evaluated on BrowserGym
and AgentDojo, agents fine-tuned with ARLAS achieve a significantly lower
attack success rate than the original model while also improving their task
success rate. Our analysis further confirms that the adversarial process
generates a diverse and challenging set of attacks, leading to a more robust
agent compared to the base model.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文研究元强化学习，提出了两种基于Thompson采样的算法MTSRL和MTSRL⁺，通过线性价值函数表示和高斯元先验，在任务间共享结构信息，实现了优于独立任务学习的元遗憾保证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 动机在于利用相关任务间的结构相似性来提高强化学习效率，特别是在任务特定的最优动作价值函数具有线性表示的情况下，通过元学习共享知识。

Method: 方法包括：1) MTSRL算法，仅学习先验均值并使用已知协方差进行后验采样；2) MTSRL⁺算法，额外估计协方差并使用先验扩展控制有限样本估计误差；3) 先验对齐技术，将学习到的先验后验与知道真实先验的元预言机耦合。

Result: 结果：在已知协方差情况下获得Õ(H⁴S³/²√(ANK))元遗憾，在学习协方差情况下获得Õ(H⁴S³/²√(AN³K))元遗憾；当任务数量K足够大时，两种算法都优于独立任务学习。模拟实验显示MTSRL/MTSRL⁺在短暂探索后能跟踪元预言机并显著优于独立RL和仅元bandit基线。

Conclusion: 结论：这是首个为具有学习Q先验的Thompson风格RL提供元遗憾保证的工作，为实验丰富的环境提供了实用方法（通过RLSVI预热启动、OLS聚合、协方差扩展）。

Abstract: We study meta-reinforcement learning in finite-horizon MDPs where related
tasks share similar structures in their optimal action-value functions.
Specifically, we posit a linear representation
$Q^*_h(s,a)=\Phi_h(s,a)\,\theta^{(k)}_h$ and place a Gaussian meta-prior $
\mathcal{N}(\theta^*_h,\Sigma^*_h)$ over the task-specific parameters
$\theta^{(k)}_h$. Building on randomized value functions, we propose two
Thompson-style algorithms: (i) MTSRL, which learns only the prior mean and
performs posterior sampling with the learned mean and known covariance; and
(ii) $\text{MTSRL}^{+}$, which additionally estimates the covariance and
employs prior widening to control finite-sample estimation error. Further, we
develop a prior-alignment technique that couples the posterior under the
learned prior with a meta-oracle that knows the true prior, yielding
meta-regret guarantees: we match prior-independent Thompson sampling in the
small-task regime and strictly improve with more tasks once the prior is
learned. Concretely, for known covariance we obtain
$\tilde{O}(H^{4}S^{3/2}\sqrt{ANK})$ meta-regret, and with learned covariance
$\tilde{O}(H^{4}S^{3/2}\sqrt{AN^3K})$; both recover a better behavior than
prior-independent after $K \gtrsim \tilde{O}(H^2)$ and $K \gtrsim
\tilde{O}(N^2H^2)$, respectively. Simulations on a stateful recommendation
environment (with feature and prior misspecification) show that after brief
exploration, MTSRL/MTSRL\(^+\) track the meta-oracle and substantially
outperform prior-independent RL and bandit-only meta-baselines. Our results
give the first meta-regret guarantees for Thompson-style RL with learned
Q-priors, and provide practical recipes (warm-start via RLSVI, OLS aggregation,
covariance widening) for experiment-rich settings.

Conclusion: Quantile DeepGR4J框架在径流预测精度和不确定性量化方面表现出色，可作为有效的洪水风险预警工具。

Abstract: Conceptual rainfall-runoff models aid hydrologists and climate scientists in
modelling streamflow to inform water management practices. Recent advances in
deep learning have unravelled the potential for combining hydrological models
with deep learning models for better interpretability and improved predictive
performance. In our previous work, we introduced DeepGR4J, which enhanced the
GR4J conceptual rainfall-runoff model using a deep learning model to serve as a
surrogate for the routing component. DeepGR4J had an improved rainfall-runoff
prediction accuracy, particularly in arid catchments. Quantile regression
models have been extensively used for quantifying uncertainty while aiding
extreme value forecasting. In this paper, we extend DeepGR4J using a quantile
regression-based ensemble learning framework to quantify uncertainty in
streamflow prediction. We also leverage the uncertainty bounds to identify
extreme flow events potentially leading to flooding. We further extend the
model to multi-step streamflow predictions for uncertainty bounds. We design
experiments for a detailed evaluation of the proposed framework using the
CAMELS-Aus dataset. The results show that our proposed Quantile DeepGR4J
framework improves the predictive accuracy and uncertainty interval quality
(interval score) compared to baseline deep learning models. Furthermore, we
carry out flood risk evaluation using Quantile DeepGR4J, and the results
demonstrate its suitability as an early warning system.

TL;DR: 提出自适应混合位激活量化(AMAQ)方法，通过渐进式压缩激活值和梯度，在协作训练中显著降低通信开销，同时保持模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型规模快速增长，给服务器-客户端分布式协作训练带来通信效率和计算开销的挑战，特别是在低资源设备上。

Method: 采用参数高效的分割学习，引入AMAQ策略，基于特征和层级重要性通过位正则化在通道间分配位预算，将激活和梯度从高精度(6-8位)渐进压缩到低精度(3-4位)。

Result: 在相同位预算下，AMAQ相比固定精度方法在LLaMA3 8B和Qwen2.5 7B等模型上获得约2.5%的生成准确率和1.3%的分类准确率提升，显著增强训练稳定性并减少超低位表示崩溃。

Conclusion: AMAQ能有效集成到实际多机协作训练中，在训练期间仅需适度的通信开销即可提供优越的推理准确率，是通信成本最小化的实用协作训练解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are scaling rapidly, creating significant
challenges for collaborative server client distributed training, particularly
in terms of communication efficiency and computational overheads. To address
these challenges, we implement Parameter-efficient Split Learning, which
effectively balances efficiency and performance for collaborative training on
low-resource devices.
  To reduce communication overhead in collaborative training, we introduce
Adaptive Mixed bit Activation Quantization (AMAQ), a strategy that
progressively compresses activations and gradients from high precision (6 to 8
bits) to low precision (3 to 4 bits). AMAQ achieves this by effectively
allocating bit budgets across channels based on feature wise and layer wise
importance using bit regularization.
  Under the same bit budgets, AMAQ outperforms fixed-precision approaches,
delivering about 2.5% higher generation accuracy and about 1.3% better
classification accuracy for models like LLaMA3 8B and Qwen2.5 7B. In addition,
it significantly enhances training stability and reducing ultra-low bit
representation collapse during the training.
  Experiments demonstrate that AMAQ integrates effectively into practical
multi-machine collaborative training setups, offering superior inference
accuracy with only a modest communication overhead for bits adaptation during
training. This trade off makes AMAQ a practical and effective solution for
collaborative training with minimal communication cost.

Motivation: 现有分子动力学模拟方法通常强制严格等变性、依赖顺序展开，限制了灵活性和模拟效率，且多为单任务训练，无法泛化到未见化合物和扩展时间步。

Method: 采用准等变设计（无需显式分子图）和时间注意力机制，允许并行解码多个未来状态；在TG80数据集（包含80种化合物的250万飞秒轨迹）上进行多任务预训练。

Conclusion: ATOM代表了向准确、高效和可迁移分子动力学模型迈出的重要一步。

Abstract: Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations underpin modern computational drug dis-
covery, materials science, and biochemistry. Recent machine learning models
provide high-fidelity MD predictions without the need to repeatedly solve
quantum mechanical forces, enabling significant speedups over conventional
pipelines. Yet many such methods typically enforce strict equivariance and rely
on sequential rollouts, thus limiting their flexibility and simulation
efficiency. They are also com- monly single-task, trained on individual
molecules and fixed timeframes, which restricts generalization to unseen
compounds and extended timesteps. To address these issues, we propose Atomistic
Transformer Operator for Molecules (ATOM), a pretrained transformer neural
operator for multitask molecular dynamics. ATOM adopts a quasi-equivariant
design that requires no explicit molecular graph and employs a temporal
attention mechanism, allowing for the accurate parallel decod- ing of multiple
future states. To support operator pretraining across chemicals and timescales,
we curate TG80, a large, diverse, and numerically stable MD dataset with over
2.5 million femtoseconds of trajectories across 80 compounds. ATOM achieves
state-of-the-art performance on established single-task benchmarks, such as
MD17, RMD17 and MD22. After multitask pretraining on TG80, ATOM shows
exceptional zero-shot generalization to unseen molecules across varying time
hori- zons. We believe ATOM represents a significant step toward accurate,
efficient, and transferable molecular dynamics models

Abstract: Training - the optimisation of complex models - is traditionally performed
through small, local, iterative updates [D. E. Rumelhart, G. E. Hinton, R. J.
Williams, Nature 323, 533-536 (1986)]. Approximating solutions through
truncated gradients is a paradigm dating back to Cauchy [A.-L. Cauchy, Comptes
Rendus Math\'ematique 25, 536-538 (1847)] and Newton [I. Newton, The Method of
Fluxions and Infinite Series (Henry Woodfall, London, 1736)]. This work
introduces the Method of Infinite Descent, a semi-analytic optimisation
paradigm that reformulates training as the direct solution to the first-order
optimality condition. By analytical resummation of its Taylor expansion, this
method yields an exact, algebraic equation for the update step. Realisation of
the infinite Taylor tower's cascading resummation is formally derived, and an
exploitative algorithm for the direct solve step is proposed.
  This principle is demonstrated with the herein-introduced AION (Analytic,
Infinitely-Optimisable Network) architecture. AION is a model designed
expressly to satisfy the algebraic closure required by Infinite Descent. In a
simple test problem, AION reaches the optimum in a single descent step.
Together, this optimiser-model pair exemplify how analytic structure enables
exact, non-iterative convergence. Infinite Descent extends beyond this example,
applying to any appropriately closed architecture. This suggests a new class of
semi-analytically optimisable models: the \emph{Infinity Class}; sufficient
conditions for class membership are discussed. This offers a pathway toward
non-iterative learning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Muon优化器虽然通过正交化改善了优化几何条件，但导致神经元更新高度不均匀，某些神经元主导优化过程。需要结合Adam的自适应学习率优势来平衡参数利用。

Method: NorMuon在正交化后维护每个神经元的二阶动量统计并应用行级归一化，确保平衡的参数利用。开发了基于FSDP2框架的高效分布式实现。

Result: 在多个模型规模上的实验表明，NorMuon一致优于Adam和Muon，在1.1B预训练设置中比Adam提升21.74%训练效率，比Muon提升11.31%，同时保持与Muon相当的内存占用。

Conclusion: 正交化和自适应学习率是互补而非竞争的方法，为大规模深度学习中的优化器设计开辟了新途径。

Abstract: The choice of optimizer significantly impacts the training efficiency and
computational costs of large language models (LLMs). Recently, the Muon
optimizer has demonstrated promising results by orthogonalizing parameter
updates, improving optimization geometry through better conditioning. Despite
Muon's emergence as a candidate successor to Adam, the potential for jointly
leveraging their strengths has not been systematically explored. In this work,
we bridge this gap by proposing NorMuon (Neuron-wise Normalized Muon), an
optimizer that synergistically combines orthogonalization with neuron-level
adaptive learning rates. Our analysis reveals that while Muon effectively
reduces condition numbers, the resulting updates exhibit highly non-uniform
neuron norms, causing certain neurons to dominate the optimization process.
NorMuon addresses this imbalance by maintaining second-order momentum
statistics for each neuron and applying row-wise normalization after
orthogonalization, ensuring balanced parameter utilization while preserving
Muon's conditioning benefits. To enable practical deployment at scale, we
develop an efficient distributed implementation under the FSDP2 framework that
strategically distributes orthogonalization computations across devices.
Experiments across multiple model scales demonstrate that NorMuon consistently
outperforms both Adam and Muon, achieving 21.74% better training efficiency
than Adam and 11.31% improvement over Muon on 1.1 B pretraining setting, while
maintaining a comparable memory footprint to Muon. Our findings suggest that
orthogonalization and adaptive learning rates are complementary rather than
competing approaches, opening new avenues for optimizer design in large-scale
deep learning.

Result: 在PTB-XL数据集上评估，MIDT-ECG显著提升形态一致性，隐私保护指标比基线提高4-8%，导联间相关误差平均降低74%，人口统计条件化增强信噪比和个性化。在低数据情况下，使用合成ECG训练的模型性能接近仅使用真实数据的模型。

Conclusion: 采用时频结构正则化方案训练的ECG合成器可作为个性化、高保真、隐私保护的替代方案，在真实数据稀缺时推进生成式AI在医疗领域的负责任使用。

Abstract: The development of machine learning for cardiac care is severely hampered by
privacy restrictions on sharing real patient electrocardiogram (ECG) data.
Although generative AI offers a promising solution, the real-world use of
existing model-synthesized ECGs is limited by persistent gaps in
trustworthiness and clinical utility. In this work, we address two major
shortcomings of current generative ECG methods: insufficient morphological
fidelity and the inability to generate personalized, patient-specific
physiological signals. To address these gaps, we build on a conditional
diffusion-based Structured State Space Model (SSSD-ECG) with two principled
innovations: (1) MIDT-ECG (Mel-Spectrogram Informed Diffusion Training), a
novel training paradigm with time-frequency domain supervision to enforce
physiological structural realism, and (2) multi-modal demographic conditioning
to enable patient-specific synthesis. We comprehensively evaluate our approach
on the PTB-XL dataset, assessing the synthesized ECG signals on fidelity,
clinical coherence, privacy preservation, and downstream task utility. MIDT-ECG
achieves substantial gains: it improves morphological coherence, preserves
strong privacy guarantees with all metrics evaluated exceeding the baseline by
4-8%, and notably reduces the interlead correlation error by an average of 74%,
while demographic conditioning enhances signal-to-noise ratio and
personalization. In critical low-data regimes, a classifier trained on datasets
supplemented with our synthetic ECGs achieves performance comparable to a
classifier trained solely on real data. Together, we demonstrate that ECG
synthesizers, trained with the proposed time-frequency structural
regularization scheme, can serve as personalized, high-fidelity,
privacy-preserving surrogates when real data are scarce, advancing the
responsible use of generative AI in healthcare.

*Yang Cao,Zhao Song,Jiahao Zhang,Jiale Zhao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文通过电路复杂性视角分析了等变图神经网络在晶体结构预测中的计算和表达能力极限，证明在多项式精度下EGNN可被TC^0阈值电路族模拟。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管等变图神经网络在材料科学中表现出强大的经验性能，但其在周期性、对称性约束环境下的表达能力仍未被充分理解，需要从计算复杂性角度进行理论分析。

Method: 采用电路复杂性理论，分析EGNN层在节点特征、原子坐标和晶格矩阵上的计算过程，证明在特定资源约束下EGNN可被TC^0电路族模拟。

Result: 证明了在多项式精度、O(n)嵌入宽度、O(1)层数和O(1)深度等条件下，EGNN可被多项式大小的均匀TC^0阈值电路族模拟，并给出了明确的常数深度界限。

Conclusion: 将EGNN置于TC^0复杂性类中为对称感知图学习提供了复杂性理论基础，揭示了在现实资源约束下此类架构可解决问题的具体上限，并指明了超越该限制所需的架构改进方向。

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) have become a core paradigm for learning on
relational data. In materials science, equivariant GNNs (EGNNs) have emerged as
a compelling backbone for crystalline-structure prediction, owing to their
ability to respect Euclidean symmetries and periodic boundary conditions.
Despite strong empirical performance, their expressive power in periodic,
symmetry-constrained settings remains poorly understood. This work
characterizes the intrinsic computational and expressive limits of EGNNs for
crystalline-structure prediction through a circuit-complexity lens. We analyze
the computations carried out by EGNN layers acting on node features, atomic
coordinates, and lattice matrices, and prove that, under polynomial precision,
embedding width $d=O(n)$ for $n$ nodes, $O(1)$ layers, and $O(1)$-depth,
$O(n)$-width MLP instantiations of the message/update/readout maps, these
models admit a simulation by a uniform $\mathsf{TC}^0$ threshold-circuit family
of polynomial size (with an explicit constant-depth bound). Situating EGNNs
within $\mathsf{TC}^0$ provides a concrete ceiling on the decision and
prediction problems solvable by such architectures under realistic resource
constraints and clarifies which architectural modifications (e.g., increased
depth, richer geometric primitives, or wider layers) are required to transcend
this regime. The analysis complements Weisfeiler-Lehman style results that do
not directly transfer to periodic crystals, and offers a complexity-theoretic
foundation for symmetry-aware graph learning on crystalline systems.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该研究开发了一种基于脑电图(EEG)的疼痛监测系统，使用机器学习模型对高疼痛与低/无疼痛状态进行分类，在离线测试中达到88.9%的准确率，实时模型达到94.2%的准确率，证明了在临床环境中应用的可行性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前医院疼痛评估主要依赖患者自述或非特异性心电图生命体征，这使得危重、镇静和认知障碍患者面临疼痛治疗不足或阿片类药物过度使用的风险。

Method: 使用52名健康成年人在三种激光诱发疼痛强度下的EEG数据，将4秒时段转换为537个特征向量，评估了9种传统机器学习模型，采用留一交叉验证。

Result: 支持向量机(RBF核)在离线测试中达到88.9%准确率和亚毫秒推理时间(1.02ms)；实时XGBoost模型保持约4ms端到端延迟和94.2%准确率。

Conclusion: 基于EEG的疼痛监测器在临床环境中技术上可行，为临床验证提供了途径，特征重要性分析与当前经典疼痛生理学一致。

Abstract: Current pain assessment within hospitals often relies on self-reporting or
non-specific EKG vital signs. This system leaves critically ill, sedated, and
cognitively impaired patients vulnerable to undertreated pain and opioid
overuse. Electroencephalography (EEG) offers a noninvasive method of measuring
brain activity. This technology could potentially be applied as an assistive
tool to highlight nociceptive processing in order to mitigate this issue. In
this study, we compared machine learning models for classifying high-pain
versus low/no-pain EEG epochs using data from fifty-two healthy adults exposed
to laser-evoked pain at three intensities (low, medium, high). Each four-second
epoch was transformed into a 537-feature vector spanning spectral power, band
ratios, Hjorth parameters, entropy measures, coherence, wavelet energies, and
peak-frequency metrics. Nine traditional machine learning models were evaluated
with leave-one-participant-out cross-validation. A support vector machine with
radial basis function kernel achieved the best offline performance with 88.9%
accuracy and sub-millisecond inference time (1.02 ms). Our Feature importance
analysis was consistent with current canonical pain physiology, showing
contralateral alpha suppression, midline theta/alpha enhancement, and frontal
gamma bursts. The real-time XGBoost model maintained an end-to-end latency of
about 4 ms and 94.2% accuracy, demonstrating that an EEG-based pain monitor is
technically feasible within a clinical setting and provides a pathway towards
clinical validation.

*Wei-Ting Tang,Akshay Kudva,Joel A. Paulson*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: NeST-BO是一种针对高维贝叶斯优化的局部方法，通过联合学习梯度和海森矩阵信息来逼近牛顿步，并利用前瞻误差界选择评估点，实现了在随机嵌入或稀疏子空间中的高效扩展。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 贝叶斯优化在高维问题上仍然具有挑战性，传统方法难以有效处理高维空间中的黑盒优化问题。

Method: 提出NeST-BO方法，使用高斯过程代理模型联合学习梯度和海森矩阵信息，通过一步前瞻牛顿步误差界选择评估点，并在低维子空间中优化获取函数以实现可扩展性。

Result: 在包括数千个变量和未知活动子空间的高维合成和真实世界问题上，NeST-BO相比最先进的局部和高维贝叶斯优化基线方法，始终表现出更快的收敛速度和更低的遗憾值。

Conclusion: NeST-BO通过有效逼近牛顿步并在低维子空间中实现可扩展性，为高维贝叶斯优化提供了一种有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Bayesian optimization (BO) is effective for expensive black-box problems but
remains challenging in high dimensions. We propose NeST-BO, a local BO method
that targets the Newton step by jointly learning gradient and Hessian
information with Gaussian process surrogates, and selecting evaluations via a
one-step lookahead bound on Newton-step error. We show that this bound (and
hence the step error) contracts with batch size, so NeST-BO directly inherits
inexact-Newton convergence: global progress under mild stability assumptions
and quadratic local rates once steps are sufficiently accurate. To scale, we
optimize the acquisition in low-dimensional subspaces (e.g., random embeddings
or learned sparse subspaces), reducing the dominant cost of learning curvature
from $O(d^2)$ to $O(m^2)$ with $m \ll d$ while preserving step targeting.
Across high-dimensional synthetic and real-world problems, including cases with
thousands of variables and unknown active subspaces, NeST-BO consistently
yields faster convergence and lower regret than state-of-the-art local and
high-dimensional BO baselines.

Motivation: 现有的RLHF和DPO方法存在偏好数据污染、奖励过优化和冗长性偏差三个严重问题，大多数工作只解决其中一个问题，且缺乏理论保证。

Method: 提出了RLHF-COV和DPO-COV算法，在离线和在线设置下同时解决三个问题，DPO-COV无需奖励估计且实现简单。

Result: 理论证明了DPO-COV在污染数据上的泛化误差率与干净数据情况下的最优已知率匹配，实验验证了算法在离线和在线设置下的有效性。

Conclusion: RLHF-COV和DPO-COV能同时解决三个关键问题，理论上有保障，实验有效，且证明了RLHF与DPO的等价性。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) and direct preference
optimization (DPO) are important techniques to align large language models
(LLM) with human preference. However, the quality of RLHF and DPO training is
seriously compromised by \textit{\textbf{C}orrupted} preference, reward
\textit{\textbf{O}veroptimization}, and bias towards
\textit{\textbf{V}erbosity}. To our knowledge, most existing works tackle only
one of these important issues, and the few other works require much computation
to estimate multiple reward models and lack theoretical guarantee of
generalization ability. In this work, we propose RLHF-\textbf{COV} and
DPO-\textbf{COV} algorithms that can simultaneously mitigate these three
issues, in both offline and online settings. This ability is theoretically
demonstrated by obtaining length-regularized generalization error rates for our
DPO-COV algorithms trained on corrupted data, which match the best-known rates
for simpler cases with clean data and without length regularization. Moreover,
our DPO-COV algorithm is simple to implement without reward estimation, and is
proved to be equivalent to our RLHF-COV algorithm, which directly implies the
equivalence between the vanilla RLHF and DPO algorithms. Experiments
demonstrate the effectiveness of our DPO-COV algorithms under both offline and
online settings.

Motivation: 图元模型需要大图进行准确估计，但实践中常遇到小规模网络。迁移学习框架可利用相关大图的结信息提升小目标图的估计精度。

Method: GTRANS结合邻域平滑和Gromov-Wasserstein最优传输来对齐图结构，包含自适应去偏机制通过残差平滑识别和校正目标特定偏差。

Conclusion: GTRANS是一个有效的迁移学习框架，能成功利用源图信息改善小目标图的图元估计，防止负迁移并提升下游应用性能。

Abstract: Graphon models provide a flexible nonparametric framework for estimating
latent connectivity probabilities in networks, enabling a range of downstream
applications such as link prediction and data augmentation. However, accurate
graphon estimation typically requires a large graph, whereas in practice, one
often only observes a small-sized network. One approach to addressing this
issue is to adopt a transfer learning framework, which aims to improve
estimation in a small target graph by leveraging structural information from a
larger, related source graph. In this paper, we propose a novel method, namely
GTRANS, a transfer learning framework that integrates neighborhood smoothing
and Gromov-Wasserstein optimal transport to align and transfer structural
patterns between graphs. To prevent negative transfer, GTRANS includes an
adaptive debiasing mechanism that identifies and corrects for target-specific
deviations via residual smoothing. We provide theoretical guarantees on the
stability of the estimated alignment matrix and demonstrate the effectiveness
of GTRANS in improving the accuracy of target graph estimation through
extensive synthetic and real data experiments. These improvements translate
directly to enhanced performance in downstream applications, such as the graph
classification task and the link prediction task.

TL;DR: ARMOR是一种新型的一次性训练后剪枝算法，通过矩阵分解方法实现2:4稀疏化，在保持推理加速和内存减少的同时，显著优于现有2:4剪枝方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型部署面临巨大计算和内存需求挑战，现有2:4稀疏化方法通常导致显著的性能下降，需要更有效的剪枝技术来平衡模型压缩和任务精度。

Method: ARMOR将每个权重矩阵分解为2:4稀疏核心和两个低开销的块对角矩阵包装器，通过块坐标下降算法最小化层间代理损失来选择稀疏核心和块对角包装器。

Result: 在Llama和Qwen模型系列上的实验表明，ARMOR在下游任务和困惑度评估中持续显著优于最先进的2:4剪枝方法，同时保持推理加速和内存使用减少。

Conclusion: ARMOR在模型压缩和任务精度之间建立了更有效的权衡，为大型语言模型的实用硬件加速提供了更好的解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) present significant deployment challenges due to
their immense computational and memory requirements. While semi-structured
pruning, particularly 2:4 sparsity, offers a path to practical hardware
acceleration, existing methods often incur substantial performance degradation.
To bridge this gap, we introduce ARMOR: (Adaptive Representation with
Matrix-factORization), a novel one-shot post-training pruning algorithm.
Instead of directly pruning weights, ARMOR factorizes each weight matrix into a
2:4 sparse core wrapped by two low-overhead, block diagonal matrices. These
wrappers act as efficient pre and post-transformation error correctors,
offering greater flexibility to preserve model quality compared to conventional
2:4 pruning techniques. The sparse core and block diagonal wrappers are chosen
through a block coordinate descent algorithm that minimizes a layer-wise proxy
loss. We theoretically prove this optimization is guaranteed to converge to a
solution with a proxy loss less than or equal to state-of-the-art pruning
algorithms. Experiments on Llama (Touvron et al., 2023; Dubey et al., 2024) and
Qwen (Yang et al., 2025) model families demonstrate that ARMOR consistently and
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art 2:4 pruning methods across a wide
range of downstream tasks and perplexity evaluations. ARMOR achieves this
superior performance while retaining the inference speedups and substantial
memory usage reductions of 2:4 pruning, establishing a more effective trade-off
between model compression and task accuracy

### [73] [LATTA: Langevin-Anchored Test-Time Adaptation for Enhanced Robustness and Stability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05530)
*Harshil Vejendla*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LATTA是一种新的测试时自适应方法，通过随机梯度朗之万动力学噪声扰动和稳定权重锚点机制，在保持稳定性的同时有效适应分布偏移，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有测试时自适应方法（如Tent）存在不稳定性和灾难性遗忘问题，特别是在小批量或挑战性数据损坏情况下，这源于在复杂损失表面上过于确定性的更新。

Method: 提出Langevin-Anchored测试时自适应(LATTA)：1) 受随机梯度朗之万动力学启发的噪声权重扰动，探索局部参数空间并逃离不良局部最小值；2) 稳定权重锚点防止模型偏离其鲁棒的源预训练。

Result: 在标准基准测试（Rotated-MNIST和CIFAR-10-C）上，LATTA显著优于Tent、CoTTA和EATA等方法，在CIFAR-10-C上平均准确率提高超过2%，同时降低性能方差，创下自监督TTA的新最优水平。

Conclusion: LATTA通过结合噪声探索和稳定锚点机制，实现了有效且稳定的测试时自适应，无需架构更改或昂贵的蒙特卡洛计算，为处理分布偏移提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Test-time adaptation (TTA) aims to adapt a pretrained model to distribution
shifts using only unlabeled test data. While promising, existing methods like
Tent suffer from instability and can catastrophically forget the source
knowledge, especially with small batch sizes or challenging corruptions. We
argue that this arises from overly deterministic updates on a complex loss
surface. In this paper, we introduce Langevin-Anchored Test-Time Adaptation
(LATTA), a novel approach that regularizes adaptation through two key
mechanisms: (1) a noisy weight perturbation inspired by Stochastic Gradient
Langevin Dynamics (SGLD) to explore the local parameter space and escape poor
local minima, and (2) a stable weight anchor that prevents the model from
diverging from its robust source pre-training. This combination allows LATTA to
adapt effectively without sacrificing stability. Unlike prior Bayesian TTA
methods, LATTA requires no architectural changes or expensive Monte Carlo
passes. We conduct extensive experiments on standard benchmarks, including
Rotated-MNIST and the more challenging CIFAR-10-C. Our results demonstrate that
LATTA significantly outperforms existing methods, including Tent, CoTTA, and
EATA, setting a new state of the art for self-supervised TTA by improving
average accuracy on CIFAR-10-C by over 2% while simultaneously reducing
performance variance.

Result: 大量实验验证了框架的有效性、鲁棒性和效率，在联邦学习场景中展现出强大的泛化能力

Conclusion: 该框架成功解决了联邦学习环境下的特征选择挑战，实现了隐私保护的知识融合和分布不平衡处理

Abstract: Feature selection eliminates redundancy among features to improve downstream
task performance while reducing computational overhead. Existing methods often
struggle to capture intricate feature interactions and adapt across diverse
application scenarios. Recent advances employ generative intelligence to
alleviate these drawbacks. However, these methods remain constrained by
permutation sensitivity in embedding and reliance on convexity assumptions in
gradient-based search. To address these limitations, our initial work
introduces a novel framework that integrates permutation-invariant embedding
with policy-guided search. Although effective, it still left opportunities to
adapt to realistic distributed scenarios. In practice, data across local
clients is highly imbalanced, heterogeneous and constrained by strict privacy
regulations, limiting direct sharing. These challenges highlight the need for a
framework that can integrate feature selection knowledge across clients without
exposing sensitive information. In this extended journal version, we advance
the framework from two perspectives: 1) developing a privacy-preserving
knowledge fusion strategy to derive a unified representation space without
sharing sensitive raw data. 2) incorporating a sample-aware weighting strategy
to address distributional imbalance among heterogeneous local clients.
Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness, robustness, and efficiency of
our framework. The results further demonstrate its strong generalization
ability in federated learning scenarios. The code and data are publicly

TL;DR: 论文分析了长上下文下注意力机制的病理现象——注意力分数随上下文长度增加而趋于均匀化（rank-collapse），并通过理论分析证明了注意力缩放的必要性，发现临界缩放因子为β_n ∝ log n。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型处理更长的上下文，注意力层出现根本性病理：注意力分数随上下文长度增加而崩溃为均匀分布，导致token过度聚类。虽然注意力缩放通过多对数因子β_n重新缩放注意力分数有效解决了这一问题，但该方法缺乏理论依据。

Method: 作者分析了一个简化但可处理的模型，该模型放大了注意力缩放的效果。在该模型中，注意力表现出由缩放因子β_n控制的相变：缩放不足会使所有token坍缩到单一方向，而过度缩放则使注意力退化为恒等变换，消除token间的有意义的交互。

Result: 主要结果确定了临界缩放β_n ∝ log n，并为YaRN和Qwen中的注意力缩放提供了严格的理论依据，阐明了为什么对数缩放能在长上下文长度下保持稀疏、内容自适应的注意力。

Conclusion: 研究通过理论分析证明了注意力缩放在处理长上下文中的必要性，确定了临界缩放因子为对数尺度，为现有方法提供了理论支撑，并解释了为什么对数缩放能有效维持注意力的稀疏性和适应性。

Abstract: As large language models scale to longer contexts, attention layers suffer
from a fundamental pathology: attention scores collapse toward uniformity as
context length $n$ increases, causing tokens to cluster excessively, a
phenomenon known as rank-collapse. While $\textit{attention scaling}$
effectively addresses this deficiency by rescaling attention scores with a
polylogarithmic factor $\beta_n$, theoretical justification for this approach
remains lacking.
  We analyze a simplified yet tractable model that magnifies the effect of
attention scaling. In this model, attention exhibits a phase transition
governed by the scaling factor $\beta_n$: insufficient scaling collapses all
tokens to a single direction, while excessive scaling reduces attention to
identity, thereby eliminating meaningful interactions between tokens. Our main
result identifies the critical scaling $\beta_n \asymp \log n$ and provides a
rigorous justification for attention scaling in YaRN and Qwen, clarifying why
logarithmic scaling maintains sparse, content-adaptive attention at large
context lengths.

Abstract: Spoofing detection in financial trading is crucial, especially for
identifying complex behaviors such as conspiracy spoofing. Traditional
machine-learning approaches primarily focus on isolated node features, often
overlooking the broader context of interconnected nodes. Graph-based
techniques, particularly Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), have advanced the field
by leveraging relational information effectively. However, in real-world
spoofing detection datasets, trading behaviors exhibit dynamic, irregular
patterns. Existing spoofing detection methods, though effective in some
scenarios, struggle to capture the complexity of dynamic and diverse, evolving
inter-node relationships. To address these challenges, we propose a novel
framework called the Generative Dynamic Graph Model (GDGM), which models
dynamic trading behaviors and the relationships among nodes to learn
representations for conspiracy spoofing detection. Specifically, our approach
incorporates the generative dynamic latent space to capture the temporal
patterns and evolving market conditions. Raw trading data is first converted
into time-stamped sequences. Then we model trading behaviors using the neural
ordinary differential equations and gated recurrent units, to generate the
representation incorporating temporal dynamics of spoofing patterns.
Furthermore, pseudo-label generation and heterogeneous aggregation techniques
are employed to gather relevant information and enhance the detection
performance for conspiratorial spoofing behaviors. Experiments conducted on
spoofing detection datasets demonstrate that our approach outperforms
state-of-the-art models in detection accuracy. Additionally, our spoofing
detection system has been successfully deployed in one of the largest global
trading markets, further validating the practical applicability and performance
of the proposed method.

Abstract: Graph simulation has recently received a surge of attention in graph
processing and analytics. In real-life applications, e.g. social science,
biology, and chemistry, many graphs are composed of a series of evolving graphs
(i.e., temporal graphs). While most of the existing graph generators focus on
static graphs, the temporal information of the graphs is ignored. In this
paper, we focus on simulating temporal graphs, which aim to reproduce the
structural and temporal properties of the observed real-life temporal graphs.
In this paper, we first give an overview of the existing temporal graph
generators, including recently emerged learning-based approaches. Most of these
learning-based methods suffer from one of the limitations: low efficiency in
training or slow generating, especially for temporal random walk-based methods.
Therefore, we propose an efficient learning-based approach to generate graph
snapshots, namely temporal graph autoencoder (TGAE). Specifically, we propose
an attention-based graph encoder to encode temporal and structural
characteristics on sampled ego-graphs. And we proposed an ego-graph decoder
that can achieve a good trade-off between simulation quality and efficiency in
temporal graph generation. Finally, the experimental evaluation is conducted
among our proposed TGAE and representative temporal graph generators on
real-life temporal graphs and synthesized graphs. It is reported that our
proposed approach outperforms the state-of-the-art temporal graph generators by
means of simulation quality and efficiency.

Conclusion: 通过协作学习和隐私学习的协同设计，实现了高效的差分隐私嵌入共享方案，在保持隐私保护的同时提高了资源效率。

Abstract: Traditional collaborative learning approaches are based on sharing of model
weights between clients and a server. However, there are advantages to resource
efficiency through schemes based on sharing of embeddings (activations) created
from the data. Several differentially private methods were developed for
sharing of weights while such mechanisms do not exist so far for sharing of
embeddings. We propose Ours to learn a privacy encoding network in conjunction
with a small utility generation network such that the final embeddings
generated from it are equipped with formal differential privacy guarantees.
These privatized embeddings are then shared with a more powerful server, that
learns a post-processing that results in a higher accuracy for machine learning
tasks. We show that our co-design of collaborative and private learning results

Main category: cs.LG

Motivation: 大型语言模型在训练过程中会记忆训练数据，导致严重的隐私泄露风险，需要更有效的隐私风险评估方法。

Conclusion: token级成员推理为LLM隐私研究提供了新视角，能够实现更精准的隐私保护和针对性缓解措施如精确遗忘。

Abstract: Machine learning models are known to leak sensitive information, as they
inevitably memorize (parts of) their training data. More alarmingly, large
language models (LLMs) are now trained on nearly all available data, which
amplifies the magnitude of information leakage and raises serious privacy
risks. Hence, it is more crucial than ever to quantify privacy risk before the
release of LLMs. The standard method to quantify privacy is via membership
inference attacks, where the state-of-the-art approach is the Robust Membership
Inference Attack (RMIA). In this paper, we present InfoRMIA, a principled
information-theoretic formulation of membership inference. Our method
consistently outperforms RMIA across benchmarks while also offering improved
computational efficiency.
  In the second part of the paper, we identify the limitations of treating
sequence-level membership inference as the gold standard for measuring leakage.
We propose a new perspective for studying membership and memorization in LLMs:
token-level signals and analyses. We show that a simple token-based InfoRMIA
can pinpoint which tokens are memorized within generated outputs, thereby
localizing leakage from the sequence level down to individual tokens, while
achieving stronger sequence-level inference power on LLMs. This new scope
rethinks privacy in LLMs and can lead to more targeted mitigation, such as
exact unlearning.

TL;DR: TimePD是首个用于时间序列预测的源自由域自适应框架，通过代理去噪和LLM泛化能力，在无法访问源数据的情况下将预训练模型从充足源时间序列适配到稀疏目标时间序列。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 移动设备产生大量跨领域时间序列数据，需要在不违反数据保护法规的情况下，将预训练模型从源域适配到目标域进行时间序列预测。

Method: 提出TimePD框架，包含三个关键组件：双分支不变解耦特征学习（基于季节趋势分解）、轻量级无参数代理去噪（动态校准LLM系统偏差）、双向知识蒸馏（对齐去噪预测和原始目标预测）。

Result: 在真实世界数据集上的广泛实验表明，TimePD平均优于最先进基线方法9.3%。

Conclusion: TimePD通过结合LLM的泛化能力和代理去噪机制，有效解决了源自由时间序列预测的域自适应问题，在保护数据隐私的同时实现了优异的预测性能。

Abstract: The proliferation of mobile devices generates a massive volume of time series
across various domains, where effective time series forecasting enables a
variety of real-world applications. This study focuses on a new problem of
source-free domain adaptation for time series forecasting. It aims to adapt a
pretrained model from sufficient source time series to the sparse target time
series domain without access to the source data, embracing data protection
regulations. To achieve this, we propose TimePD, the first source-free time
series forecasting framework with proxy denoising, where large language models
(LLMs) are employed to benefit from their generalization capabilities.
Specifically, TimePD consists of three key components: (1) dual-branch
invariant disentangled feature learning that enforces representation- and
gradient-wise invariance by means of season-trend decomposition; (2)
lightweight, parameter-free proxy denoising that dynamically calibrates
systematic biases of LLMs; and (3) knowledge distillation that bidirectionally
aligns the denoised prediction and the original target prediction. Extensive
experiments on real-world datasets offer insight into the effectiveness of the
proposed TimePD, outperforming SOTA baselines by 9.3% on average.

TL;DR: 深度学习存在根本的可预测性限制，源于其吸引盆的碎形几何结构：任何导致一个解的初始化都无限接近另一个导致不同解的初始化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究深度学习中的根本可预测性限制，揭示神经网络训练结果难以预测和复现的深层原因。

Method: 通过分析深度学习中广泛观察到的特征（包括混沌学习动态和对称性诱导的不变子空间），推导出碎形吸引盆出现的充分条件。

Result: 发现深度学习吸引盆具有无限精细的碎形结构，不确定性指数接近零，即使大幅提高初始条件精度也只能略微改善结果可预测性。

Conclusion: 碎形吸引盆对神经网络训练的可预测性和可复现性施加了根本限制，为深度学习提供了一个重要的组织原则，对优化和AI安全部署具有重要意义。

Abstract: Fundamental limits to predictability are central to our understanding of many
physical and computational systems. Here we show that, despite its remarkable
capabilities, deep learning exhibits such fundamental limits rooted in the
fractal, riddled geometry of its basins of attraction: any initialization that
leads to one solution lies arbitrarily close to another that leads to a
different one. We derive sufficient conditions for the emergence of riddled
basins by analytically linking features widely observed in deep learning,
including chaotic learning dynamics and symmetry-induced invariant subspaces,
to reveal a general route to riddling in realistic deep networks. The resulting
basins of attraction possess an infinitely fine-scale fractal structure
characterized by an uncertainty exponent near zero, so that even large
increases in the precision of initial conditions yield only marginal gains in
outcome predictability. Riddling thus imposes a fundamental limit on the
predictability and hence reproducibility of neural network training, providing
a unified account of many empirical observations. These results reveal a
general organizing principle of deep learning with important implications for
optimization and the safe deployment of artificial intelligence.

TL;DR: MCNO提出了一种学习一维偏微分方程解算子的框架，通过直接学习核函数并使用蒙特卡洛方法近似相关积分算子，无需傅里叶神经算子的平移不变性假设。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为偏微分方程提供一种不依赖谱表示或平移不变性假设的神经算子框架，探索蒙特卡洛积分在连续域PDE中的应用。

Method: 将核函数表示为可学习张量，在离散网格上均匀随机采样一次，通过插值步骤在不同网格间映射，使用蒙特卡洛估计器近似积分算子。

Result: 在标准1D PDE基准测试中达到竞争性精度，计算效率高，理论分析证明蒙特卡洛估计器在温和正则性假设下具有有界偏差和方差。

Conclusion: MCNO为谱方法（如FNO）和图基蒙特卡洛方法（如GNO）提供了理论支持的替代方案，可自然扩展到多维问题。

Abstract: The Monte Carlo-type Neural Operator (MCNO) introduces a framework for
learning solution operators of one-dimensional partial differential equations
(PDEs) by directly learning the kernel function and approximating the
associated integral operator using a Monte Carlo-type approach. Unlike Fourier
Neural Operators (FNOs), which rely on spectral representations and assume
translation-invariant kernels, MCNO makes no such assumptions. The kernel is
represented as a learnable tensor over sampled input-output pairs, and sampling
is performed once, uniformly at random from a discretized grid. This design
enables generalization across multiple grid resolutions without relying on
fixed global basis functions or repeated sampling during training, while an
interpolation step maps between arbitrary input and output grids to further
enhance flexibility. Experiments on standard 1D PDE benchmarks show that MCNO
achieves competitive accuracy with efficient computational cost. We also
provide a theoretical analysis proving that the Monte Carlo estimator yields a
bounded bias and variance under mild regularity assumptions. This result holds
in any spatial dimension, suggesting that MCNO may extend naturally beyond
one-dimensional problems. More broadly, this work explores how Monte Carlo-type
integration can be incorporated into neural operator frameworks for
continuous-domain PDEs, providing a theoretically supported alternative to
spectral methods (such as FNO) and to graph-based Monte Carlo approaches (such
as the Graph Kernel Neural Operator, GNO).

TL;DR: NEO是一种无需超参数、计算成本极低的测试时自适应方法，通过重新中心化目标数据嵌入来改善源域与分布偏移样本的对齐，在多个数据集上表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的测试时自适应方法通常计算成本高、需要大量数据或对超参数敏感，因此需要开发更高效、鲁棒的自适应方法。

Method: 基于潜在空间几何理论，通过将目标数据嵌入重新中心化到原点来改善源域与分布偏移样本的对齐，提出无需超参数的NEO方法。

Result: 在ImageNet-C上，NEO将ViT-Base的准确率从55.6%提升到59.2%；在多个数据集上优于7种对比方法，计算成本最低；在边缘设备上减少63%推理时间和9%内存使用。

Conclusion: NEO是一种高效有效的测试时自适应方法，适用于各种ViT架构和数据集，特别适合资源受限环境。

Abstract: Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) methods are often computationally expensive,
require a large amount of data for effective adaptation, or are brittle to
hyperparameters. Based on a theoretical foundation of the geometry of the
latent space, we are able to significantly improve the alignment between source
and distribution-shifted samples by re-centering target data embeddings at the
origin. This insight motivates NEO -- a hyperparameter-free fully TTA method,
that adds no significant compute compared to vanilla inference. NEO is able to
improve the classification accuracy of ViT-Base on ImageNet-C from 55.6% to
59.2% after adapting on just one batch of 64 samples. When adapting on 512
samples NEO beats all 7 TTA methods we compare against on ImageNet-C,
ImageNet-R and ImageNet-S and beats 6/7 on CIFAR-10-C, while using the least
amount of compute. NEO performs well on model calibration metrics and
additionally is able to adapt from 1 class to improve accuracy on 999 other
classes in ImageNet-C. On Raspberry Pi and Jetson Orin Nano devices, NEO
reduces inference time by 63% and memory usage by 9% compared to baselines. Our
results based on 3 ViT architectures and 4 datasets show that NEO can be used
efficiently and effectively for TTA.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 概念侧信道模型(CSMs)通过引入侧信道提高准确性，但损害了可解释性。目前缺乏控制这种权衡的原则性方法。

Method: 提出了统一的概率概念侧信道元模型，引入SIS度量侧信道依赖度，并提出SIS正则化来惩罚侧信道依赖。

Result: 实验表明，仅追求准确性的CSMs可解释性较低，SIS正则化显著提高了可解释性、可干预性和学习到的可解释任务预测器质量。

Conclusion: 本研究为开发平衡准确性和可解释性的CSMs提供了理论和实践工具。

Abstract: Concept Bottleneck Models (CBNMs) are deep learning models that provide
interpretability by enforcing a bottleneck layer where predictions are based
exclusively on human-understandable concepts. However, this constraint also
restricts information flow and often results in reduced predictive accuracy.
Concept Sidechannel Models (CSMs) address this limitation by introducing a
sidechannel that bypasses the bottleneck and carry additional task-relevant
information. While this improves accuracy, it simultaneously compromises
interpretability, as predictions may rely on uninterpretable representations
transmitted through sidechannels. Currently, there exists no principled
technique to control this fundamental trade-off. In this paper, we close this
gap. First, we present a unified probabilistic concept sidechannel meta-model
that subsumes existing CSMs as special cases. Building on this framework, we
introduce the Sidechannel Independence Score (SIS), a metric that quantifies a
CSM's reliance on its sidechannel by contrasting predictions made with and
without sidechannel information. We propose SIS regularization, which
explicitly penalizes sidechannel reliance to improve interpretability. Finally,
we analyze how the expressivity of the predictor and the reliance of the
sidechannel jointly shape interpretability, revealing inherent trade-offs
across different CSM architectures. Empirical results show that
state-of-the-art CSMs, when trained solely for accuracy, exhibit low
representation interpretability, and that SIS regularization substantially
improves their interpretability, intervenability, and the quality of learned
interpretable task predictors. Our work provides both theoretical and practical
tools for developing CSMs that balance accuracy and interpretability in a
principled manner.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 保险欺诈检测中，图方法面临类别不平衡和异构动态网络结构的挑战，而传统梯度提升树方法仍占主导地位。

Method: 开发了归纳式图梯度提升机（G-GBM），结合图结构和梯度提升技术，用于异构动态图的监督学习。

Conclusion: G-GBM在保持梯度提升可解释性优势的同时，能够有效处理图数据的复杂关系，为保险欺诈检测提供了有前景的解决方案。

Abstract: Graph-based methods are becoming increasingly popular in machine learning due
to their ability to model complex data and relations. Insurance fraud is a
prime use case, since false claims are often the result of organised criminals
that stage accidents or the same persons filing erroneous claims on multiple
policies. One challenge is that graph-based approaches struggle to find
meaningful representations of the data because of the high class imbalance
present in fraud data. Another is that insurance networks are heterogeneous and
dynamic, given the changing relations among people, companies and policies.
That is why gradient boosted tree approaches on tabular data still dominate the
field. Therefore, we present a novel inductive graph gradient boosting machine
(G-GBM) for supervised learning on heterogeneous and dynamic graphs. We show
that our estimator competes with popular graph neural network approaches in an
experiment using a variety of simulated random graphs. We demonstrate the power
of G-GBM for insurance fraud detection using an open-source and a real-world,
proprietary dataset. Given that the backbone model is a gradient boosting
forest, we apply established explainability methods to gain better insights
into the predictions made by G-GBM.

Conclusion: 建立了原则性、不确定性感知和结构敏感的量子图神经网络解释方法，为扩展到更广泛架构和真实数据集奠定了基础

Abstract: Quantum graph neural networks offer a powerful paradigm for learning on
graph-structured data, yet their explainability is complicated by
measurement-induced stochasticity and the combinatorial nature of graph
structure. In this paper, we introduce QuantumGraphLIME (QGraphLIME), a
model-agnostic, post-hoc framework that treats model explanations as
distributions over local surrogates fit on structure-preserving perturbations
of a graph. By aggregating surrogate attributions together with their
dispersion, QGraphLIME yields uncertainty-aware node and edge importance
rankings for quantum graph models. The framework further provides a
distribution-free, finite-sample guarantee on the size of the surrogate
ensemble: a Dvoretzky-Kiefer-Wolfowitz bound ensures uniform approximation of
the induced distribution of a binary class probability at target accuracy and
confidence under standard independence assumptions. Empirical studies on
controlled synthetic graphs with known ground truth demonstrate accurate and
stable explanations, with ablations showing clear benefits of nonlinear
surrogate modeling and highlighting sensitivity to perturbation design.
Collectively, these results establish a principled, uncertainty-aware, and
structure-sensitive approach to explaining quantum graph neural networks, and
lay the groundwork for scaling to broader architectures and real-world
datasets, as quantum resources mature. Code is available at

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: vAttention是一种结合top-k和随机采样的稀疏注意力机制，提供用户指定的(ε,δ)近似精度保证，在保持高质量的同时实现高达20倍的稀疏度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有稀疏注意力方法（top-k和采样估计）存在根本局限性：无法提供跨头和查询向量的一致近似，且缺乏近似质量保证，限制了实际部署。

Method: 结合top-k和随机采样的互补优势：top-k在注意力分数由少数token主导时表现好，随机采样在注意力分数相对均匀时提供更好估计。利用采样的统计保证，开发具有(ε,δ)精度保证的vAttention机制。

Result: vAttention显著提升稀疏注意力质量（Llama-3.1-8B-Inst和Deepseek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B在RULER-HARD上提升约4.5个百分点），在推理场景中实现快速解码而不影响模型质量（在AIME2024上以10倍稀疏度达到完整模型质量）。

Conclusion: vAttention是首个具有用户指定精度保证的实用稀疏注意力机制，统一了top-k和采样方法，提供更优的质量-效率权衡，是向大规模可靠部署稀疏注意力迈出的重要一步。

Abstract: State-of-the-art sparse attention methods for reducing decoding latency fall
into two main categories: approximate top-$k$ (and its extension, top-$p$) and
recently introduced sampling-based estimation. However, these approaches are
fundamentally limited in their ability to approximate full attention: they fail
to provide consistent approximations across heads and query vectors and, most
critically, lack guarantees on approximation quality, limiting their practical
deployment. We observe that top-$k$ and random sampling are complementary:
top-$k$ performs well when attention scores are dominated by a few tokens,
whereas random sampling provides better estimates when attention scores are
relatively uniform. Building on this insight and leveraging the statistical
guarantees of sampling, we introduce vAttention, the first practical sparse
attention mechanism with user-specified $(\epsilon, \delta)$ guarantees on
approximation accuracy (thus, verified). These guarantees make vAttention a
compelling step toward practical, reliable deployment of sparse attention at
scale. By unifying top-k and sampling, vAttention outperforms both
individually, delivering a superior quality-efficiency trade-off. Our
experiments show that vAttention significantly improves the quality of sparse
attention (e.g., $\sim$4.5 percentage points for Llama-3.1-8B-Inst and
Deepseek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B on RULER-HARD), and effectively bridges the gap
between full and sparse attention (e.g., across datasets, it matches full model
quality with upto 20x sparsity). We also demonstrate that it can be deployed in
reasoning scenarios to achieve fast decoding without compromising model quality
(e.g., vAttention achieves full model quality on AIME2024 at 10x sparsity with
up to 32K token generations). Code is open-sourced at

Abstract: The widespread application of Large Language Models (LLMs) imposes increasing
demands on safety, such as reducing harmful content and fake information, and
avoiding certain forbidden tokens due to rules and laws. While there have been
several recent works studying safe alignment of LLMs, these works either
require the training of reward and cost models and incur high memory and
computational costs, or need prior knowledge about the optimal solution.
Motivated by this fact, we study the problem of constrained alignment in LLMs,
i.e., maximizing the output reward while restricting the cost due to
potentially unsafe content to stay below a threshold. For this problem, we
propose a novel primal-dual DPO approach, which first trains a model using
standard DPO on reward preference data to provide reward information, and then
adopts a rearranged Lagrangian DPO objective utilizing the provided reward
information to fine-tune LLMs on cost preference data. Our approach
significantly reduces memory and computational costs, and does not require
extra prior knowledge. Moreover, we establish rigorous theoretical guarantees
on the suboptimality and constraint violation of the output policy. We also
extend our approach to an online data setting by incorporating exploration
bonuses, which enables our approach to explore uncovered prompt-response space,
and then provide theoretical results that get rid of the dependence on
preference data coverage. Experimental results on the widely-used preference
dataset PKU-SafeRLHF demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

Abstract: Unsupervised representation learning, particularly sequential
disentanglement, aims to separate static and dynamic factors of variation in
data without relying on labels. This remains a challenging problem, as existing
approaches based on variational autoencoders and generative adversarial
networks often rely on multiple loss terms, complicating the optimization
process. Furthermore, sequential disentanglement methods face challenges when
applied to real-world data, and there is currently no established evaluation
protocol for assessing their performance in such settings. Recently, diffusion
models have emerged as state-of-the-art generative models, but no theoretical
formalization exists for their application to sequential disentanglement. In
this work, we introduce the Diffusion Sequential Disentanglement Autoencoder
(DiffSDA), a novel, modal-agnostic framework effective across diverse
real-world data modalities, including time series, video, and audio. DiffSDA
leverages a new probabilistic modeling, latent diffusion, and efficient
samplers, while incorporating a challenging evaluation protocol for rigorous
testing. Our experiments on diverse real-world benchmarks demonstrate that
DiffSDA outperforms recent state-of-the-art methods in sequential
disentanglement.

Abstract: Graph embedding has been widely applied in areas such as network analysis,
social network mining, recommendation systems, and bioinformatics. However,
current graph construction methods often require the prior definition of
neighborhood size, limiting the effective revelation of potential structural
correlations in the data. Additionally, graph embedding methods using linear
projection heavily rely on a singular pattern mining approach, resulting in
relative weaknesses in adapting to different scenarios. To address these
challenges, we propose a novel model, Neighborhood-Adaptive Generalized Linear
Graph Embedding (NGLGE), grounded in latent pattern mining. This model
introduces an adaptive graph learning method tailored to the neighborhood,
effectively revealing intrinsic data correlations. Simultaneously, leveraging a
reconstructed low-rank representation and imposing $\ell_{2,0}$ norm constraint
on the projection matrix allows for flexible exploration of additional pattern
information. Besides, an efficient iterative solving algorithm is derived for
the proposed model. Comparative evaluations on datasets from diverse scenarios
demonstrate the superior performance of our model compared to state-of-the-art
methods.

Conclusion: 学习型调度器能够生成更接近数据分布的样本，显著优于传统启发式调度策略，为掩码扩散模型提供了更有效的解掩码顺序决策方法。

Abstract: Masked diffusion models (MDMs) have recently emerged as a novel framework for
language modeling. MDMs generate sentences by iteratively denoising masked
sequences, filling in [MASK] tokens step by step. Although MDMs support
any-order sampling, performance is highly sensitive to the choice of which
position to unmask next. Prior work typically relies on rule-based schedules
(e.g., max-confidence, max-margin), which provide ad hoc improvements. In
contrast, we replace these heuristics with a learned scheduler. Specifically,
we cast denoising as a KL-regularized Markov decision process (MDP) with an
explicit reference policy and optimize a regularized objective that admits
policy improvement and convergence guarantees under standard assumptions. We
prove that the optimized policy under this framework generates samples that
more closely match the data distribution than heuristic schedules. Empirically,
across four benchmarks, our learned policy consistently outperforms
max-confidence: for example, on SUDOKU, where unmasking order is critical, it
yields a 20.1% gain over random and a 11.2% gain over max-confidence.

Method: 在猎鹿游戏中测试单词"廉价谈话"通信机制，在迭代公共物品惩罚游戏中实施渐进复杂游戏的教学课程。

Result: 通信机制显著提升合作率（0%→48.3%），而课程学习降低收益27.4%，定性分析显示课程设计会引发"习得性悲观"。

Conclusion: 对于协调问题，简单通信协议比基于经验的训练更可靠，社会困境的课程设计需要谨慎考虑游戏序列中嵌入的战略教训。

Abstract: Eliciting cooperation in multi-agent LLM systems is critical for AI
alignment. We investigate two approaches: direct communication and curriculum
learning. In a 4-player Stag Hunt, a one-word "cheap talk" channel increases
cooperation from 0% to 48.3%, demonstrating communication as a robust
coordination mechanism. In contrast, we find that curriculum learning is highly
sensitive to design choices: our pedagogical curriculum through progressively
complex games reduced agent payoffs by 27.4% in an Iterated Public Goods Game
with Punishment. Qualitative analysis reveals that curricula emphasizing
defection-equilibrium games can induce "learned pessimism" in agents. These
findings suggest that for coordination problems, simple communication protocols
may be more reliable than experience-based training, and that curriculum design
for social dilemmas requires careful attention to the strategic lessons
embedded in game sequences.

### [93] [Are Heterogeneous Graph Neural Networks Truly Effective? A Causal Perspective](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05750)
*Xiao Yang,Xuejiao Zhao,Zhiqi Shen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本研究通过系统复现和因果效应分析，发现异构图神经网络(HGNNs)的性能提升主要来自异质信息而非模型架构，异质信息通过增加同质性和局部-全局分布差异来提高节点分类性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究大多假设HGNNs内在有效，但缺乏对其真正有效性来源的系统验证，特别是模型架构和异质信息各自贡献的因果效应分析。

Method: 在21个数据集和20个基线模型上进行系统复现和超参数重调优，开发因果效应估计框架，通过事实和反事实分析评估候选因素，并通过最小充分调整集、跨方法一致性检验和敏感性分析验证鲁棒性。

Result: 模型架构和复杂度对性能没有因果效应；异质信息通过增加同质性和局部-全局分布差异产生正向因果效应，使节点类别更易区分。

Conclusion: HGNNs的性能提升主要源于异质信息而非模型架构设计，这为未来图神经网络研究提供了重要启示。

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) have achieved remarkable success in node
classification. Building on this progress, heterogeneous graph neural networks
(HGNNs) integrate relation types and node and edge semantics to leverage
heterogeneous information. Causal analysis for HGNNs is advancing rapidly,
aiming to separate genuine causal effects from spurious correlations. However,
whether HGNNs are intrinsically effective remains underexamined, and most
studies implicitly assume rather than establish this effectiveness. In this
work, we examine HGNNs from two perspectives: model architecture and
heterogeneous information. We conduct a systematic reproduction across 21
datasets and 20 baselines, complemented by comprehensive hyperparameter
retuning. To further disentangle the source of performance gains, we develop a
causal effect estimation framework that constructs and evaluates candidate
factors under standard assumptions through factual and counterfactual analyses,
with robustness validated via minimal sufficient adjustment sets, cross-method
consistency checks, and sensitivity analyses. Our results lead to two
conclusions. First, model architecture and complexity have no causal effect on
performance. Second, heterogeneous information exerts a positive causal effect
by increasing homophily and local-global distribution discrepancy, which makes
node classes more distinguishable. The implementation is publicly available at
https://github.com/YXNTU/CausalHGNN.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文比较了在迁移学习设置下多种成员推理攻击(MIAs)的性能，发现攻击效果随训练数据增加而降低，且没有单一MIA能捕捉所有隐私风险。LiRA在大多数场景表现最佳，而IHA在PatchCamelyon数据集的高数据量情况下更有效。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大规模基础模型的出现，训练范式从零开始训练转向迁移学习，这使得在敏感应用中使用小型领域特定数据集进行高效训练成为可能。需要评估迁移学习模型面临的隐私泄露风险。

Method: 比较在迁移学习设置下多种成员推理攻击的性能，包括基于分数的MIAs、似然比攻击(LiRA)和逆Hessian攻击(IHA)，帮助实践者识别最有效的隐私风险评估攻击。

Result: 攻击效果随训练数据增加而降低；没有单一MIA能捕捉所有隐私风险；LiRA在大多数实验场景表现最优；IHA在PatchCamelyon数据集的高数据量情况下更有效。

Conclusion: 在迁移学习环境中，需要采用多种MIA方法来全面评估隐私风险，LiRA是通用性最好的攻击方法，但在特定数据集和条件下IHA可能更有效。

Abstract: With the emergence of powerful large-scale foundation models, the training
paradigm is increasingly shifting from from-scratch training to transfer
learning. This enables high utility training with small, domain-specific
datasets typical in sensitive applications.Membership inference attacks (MIAs)
provide an empirical estimate of the privacy leakage by machine learning
models. Yet, prior assessments of MIAs against models fine-tuned with transfer
learning rely on a small subset of possible attacks. We address this by
comparing performance of diverse MIAs in transfer learning settings to help
practitioners identify the most efficient attacks for privacy risk evaluation.
We find that attack efficacy decreases with the increase in training data for
score-based MIAs. We find that there is no one MIA which captures all privacy
risks in models trained with transfer learning. While the Likelihood Ratio
Attack (LiRA) demonstrates superior performance across most experimental
scenarios, the Inverse Hessian Attack (IHA) proves to be more effective against
models fine-tuned on PatchCamelyon dataset in high data regime.

*Shadi Rahimian,Mario Fritz*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于时间非齐次隐马尔可夫模型(TIHMMs)的合成SNP序列数据生成框架，通过限制每个SNP序列在训练中的影响来提供强差分隐私保证，解决了SNP数据共享中的隐私风险。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SNP数据集对遗传学研究至关重要，但由于SNP之间的相关性，存在掩码值重建、亲属关系和成员推断等强对抗攻击风险。现有隐私保护方法要么对统计摘要应用差分隐私，要么需要复杂后处理和使用公共数据集。

Method: 使用时间非齐次隐马尔可夫模型生成合成SNP序列数据集，通过限制每个SNP序列的梯度贡献来确保差分隐私保证，直接处理SNP内在相关性引入的隐私风险。

Result: 在1000 Genomes真实数据集上的实验表明，在ε∈[1,10]和δ=10^{-4}的隐私预算下，该方法能有效生成合成数据集，特别是通过允许HMM转移模型依赖于序列位置，显著提升了性能，使合成数据集能紧密复制非私有数据集的统计特性。

Conclusion: 该框架在保护基因组数据隐私的同时，为研究人员提供了卓越的灵活性和实用性，促进了基因组数据的私有共享。

Abstract: Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) datasets are fundamental to genetic
studies but pose significant privacy risks when shared. The correlation of SNPs
with each other makes strong adversarial attacks such as masked-value
reconstruction, kin, and membership inference attacks possible. Existing
privacy-preserving approaches either apply differential privacy to statistical
summaries of these datasets or offer complex methods that require
post-processing and the usage of a publicly available dataset to suppress or
selectively share SNPs.
  In this study, we introduce an innovative framework for generating synthetic
SNP sequence datasets using samples derived from time-inhomogeneous hidden
Markov models (TIHMMs). To preserve the privacy of the training data, we ensure
that each SNP sequence contributes only a bounded influence during training,
enabling strong differential privacy guarantees. Crucially, by operating on
full SNP sequences and bounding their gradient contributions, our method
directly addresses the privacy risks introduced by their inherent correlations.
  Through experiments conducted on the real-world 1000 Genomes dataset, we
demonstrate the efficacy of our method using privacy budgets of $\varepsilon
\in [1, 10]$ at $\delta=10^{-4}$. Notably, by allowing the transition models of
the HMM to be dependent on the location in the sequence, we significantly
enhance performance, enabling the synthetic datasets to closely replicate the
statistical properties of non-private datasets. This framework facilitates the
private sharing of genomic data while offering researchers exceptional
flexibility and utility.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种使用贝塞尔曲线替代完整SGD轨迹的数据集压缩方法，通过平滑的模型连接路径提供无噪声监督信号，解决了传统方法中的梯度不稳定、收敛慢和存储开销大的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数据集压缩方法使用完整的SGD轨迹作为对齐目标，但这些轨迹通常噪声大、曲率高且存储密集，导致梯度不稳定、收敛缓慢和内存开销大。

Method: 用平滑的低损失参数化替代物（特别是连接初始和最终模型状态的二次贝塞尔曲线）替代完整SGD轨迹，这些模型连接路径提供无噪声、低曲率的监督信号。

Result: 在五个临床数据集上优于最先进的压缩方法，生成的压缩数据集能够支持有效的临床模型开发。

Conclusion: 贝塞尔模式连接作为SGD路径的有效替代物，能够稳定梯度、加速收敛并消除密集轨迹存储需求。

Abstract: Dataset condensation (DC) enables the creation of compact, privacy-preserving
synthetic datasets that can match the utility of real patient records,
supporting democratised access to highly regulated clinical data for developing
downstream clinical models. State-of-the-art DC methods supervise synthetic
data by aligning the training dynamics of models trained on real and those
trained on synthetic data, typically using full stochastic gradient descent
(SGD) trajectories as alignment targets; however, these trajectories are often
noisy, high-curvature, and storage-intensive, leading to unstable gradients,
slow convergence, and substantial memory overhead. We address these limitations
by replacing full SGD trajectories with smooth, low-loss parametric surrogates,
specifically quadratic B\'ezier curves that connect the initial and final model
states from real training trajectories. These mode-connected paths provide
noise-free, low-curvature supervision signals that stabilise gradients,
accelerate convergence, and eliminate the need for dense trajectory storage. We
theoretically justify B\'ezier-mode connections as effective surrogates for SGD
paths and empirically show that the proposed method outperforms
state-of-the-art condensation approaches across five clinical datasets,
yielding condensed datasets that enable clinically effective model development.

TL;DR: 提出了熵粒子滤波(ePF)方法，通过熵退火和前瞻调制技术解决粒子滤波在推理时间缩放中的过早利用问题，显著提升数学推理任务的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 粒子滤波在复杂数学推理任务中表现良好，但容易受到过程奖励模型过度自信评分的影响，导致过早利用、粒子贫化问题，特别是在计算预算受限时更为严重。

Method: 引入熵粒子滤波(ePF)，包含两个新技术：1) 熵退火(EA) - 通过监控搜索多样性，在多样性下降时动态退火重采样分布；2) 前瞻调制(LaM) - 基于后继状态评估状态潜力。

Result: 在多个挑战性数学基准测试中，ePF显著优于强基线方法，任务奖励相对提升高达50%。

Conclusion: ePF通过平衡多样化解空间的探索和高奖励区域的利用，提高了粒子滤波的鲁棒性，最终获得更高质量的解决方案。

Abstract: Inference-Time Scaling (ITS) improves language models by allocating more
computation at generation time. Particle Filtering (PF) has emerged as a strong
ITS method for complex mathematical reasoning tasks, but it is vulnerable when
guided by process reward models, which often assign overconfident scores early
in the reasoning process. This causes PF to suffer from premature exploitation:
it myopically commits to locally promising trajectories, prunes potentially
correct hypotheses, and converges to suboptimal solutions. This failure mode,
known as particle impoverishment, is especially severe under constrained
computational budgets. To address this, we analyze the problem and identify two
root causes: a lack of diversity in the particle set due to overconfident
resampling and consequent inability to assess the potential of a reasoning
path. We introduce Entropic Particle Filtering (ePF), an algorithm that
integrates two new techniques to solve these issues. The first technique,
Entropic Annealing (EA), directly mitigates particle impoverishment by
monitoring search diversity via entropy; when diversity drops, it intervenes by
dynamically annealing the resampling distribution to preserve exploration. The
second, an enhancement called Look-ahead Modulation (LaM), adds a predictive
guide to evaluate a state's potential based on its successors. On several
challenging math benchmarks, ePF significantly outperforms strong baselines and
achieves up to a 50 % relative improvement in task reward. Together, these
methods improve PF's resilience by balancing the exploration of diverse
solution spaces with the exploitation of high-reward regions, ultimately
leading to higher-quality solutions.

TL;DR: 提出MDTI框架，通过多模态轨迹表示学习整合GPS序列、网格轨迹和道路网络约束，提升旅行时间估计精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法将轨迹转换为固定长度表示，忽略了真实轨迹的可变性，导致信息丢失或特征冗余。

Method: 使用模态特定编码器和跨模态交互模块捕捉空间、时间和拓扑语义，动态轨迹建模机制自适应调节不同长度轨迹的信息密度，采用对比对齐和掩码语言建模两种自监督预训练目标。

Result: 在三个真实世界数据集上的实验表明，MDTI始终优于最先进的基线方法，证实了其鲁棒性和强泛化能力。

Conclusion: MDTI框架通过多模态轨迹整合和动态建模机制，有效解决了旅行时间估计中的挑战，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Accurate travel time estimation (TTE) plays a crucial role in intelligent
transportation systems. However, it remains challenging due to heterogeneous
data sources and complex traffic dynamics. Moreover, conventional approaches
typically convert trajectories into fixed-length representations, neglecting
the inherent variability of real-world trajectories, which often leads to
information loss or feature redundancy. To address these challenges, this paper
introduces the Multimodal Dynamic Trajectory Integration (MDTI) framework--a
novel multimodal trajectory representation learning approach that integrates
GPS sequences, grid trajectories, and road network constraints to enhance TTE
accuracy. MDTI employs modality-specific encoders and a cross-modal interaction
module to capture complementary spatial, temporal, and topological semantics,
while a dynamic trajectory modeling mechanism adaptively regulates information
density for trajectories of varying lengths. Two self-supervised pretraining
objectives, named contrastive alignment and masked language modeling, further
strengthen multimodal consistency and contextual understanding. Extensive
experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate that MDTI consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, confirming its robustness and strong
generalization abilities. The code is publicly available at:

Motivation: 预训练的基于流的生成模型在条件生成或产生具有目标属性的样本时，无需重新训练成对数据，但现有方法通常需要梯度计算，限制了在梯度不可靠或不可用场景下的应用。

Method: 提出ESS-Flow方法，利用流模型通常具有高斯先验的特点，在源空间中使用椭圆切片采样进行贝叶斯推断，仅需前向通过生成模型和观测过程，无需梯度或雅可比计算。

Result: 该方法在材料设计和从稀疏残基间距离测量预测蛋白质结构等任务中表现出有效性，特别适用于基于模拟的观测或生成/观测过程中的量化等梯度不可靠场景。

Conclusion: ESS-Flow为基于流的生成模型提供了一种无需梯度的条件生成解决方案，扩展了这类模型在梯度不可用场景下的应用范围。

Abstract: Guiding pretrained flow-based generative models for conditional generation or
to produce samples with desired target properties enables solving diverse tasks
without retraining on paired data. We present ESS-Flow, a gradient-free method
that leverages the typically Gaussian prior of the source distribution in
flow-based models to perform Bayesian inference directly in the source space
using Elliptical Slice Sampling. ESS-Flow only requires forward passes through
the generative model and observation process, no gradient or Jacobian
computations, and is applicable even when gradients are unreliable or
unavailable, such as with simulation-based observations or quantization in the
generation or observation process. We demonstrate its effectiveness on
designing materials with desired target properties and predicting protein
structures from sparse inter-residue distance measurements.

Motivation: 在零售、金融、医疗和推荐系统等领域，事件发生的精确时间顺序往往不如结果集合重要，因此需要研究超越自回归范式的方法来预测未来事件分布。

Method: 分析了局部顺序不变性，引入了基于KL散度的指标来量化时间漂移，比较了显式分布预测与隐式多标记方法。

Result: 简单的显式分布预测目标始终优于复杂的隐式基线方法，预测类别模式崩溃主要由分布不平衡驱动。

Conclusion: 为选择建模策略提供了原则性框架，并为构建更准确和鲁棒的预测系统提供了实用指导。

Abstract: This paper studies forecasting of the future distribution of events in human
action sequences, a task essential in domains like retail, finance, healthcare,
and recommendation systems where the precise temporal order is often less
critical than the set of outcomes. We challenge the dominant autoregressive
paradigm and investigate whether explicitly modeling the future distribution or
order-invariant multi-token approaches outperform order-preserving methods. We
analyze local order invariance and introduce a KL-based metric to quantify
temporal drift. We find that a simple explicit distribution forecasting
objective consistently surpasses complex implicit baselines. We further
demonstrate that mode collapse of predicted categories is primarily driven by
distributional imbalance. This work provides a principled framework for
selecting modeling strategies and offers practical guidance for building more
accurate and robust forecasting systems.

Conclusion: MaNGO通过元学习和条件神经过程有效解决了图网络模拟器的参数适应问题，实现了对新物理参数的快速适应而无需重新训练。

Abstract: Accurately simulating physics is crucial across scientific domains, with
applications spanning from robotics to materials science. While traditional
mesh-based simulations are precise, they are often computationally expensive
and require knowledge of physical parameters, such as material properties. In
contrast, data-driven approaches like Graph Network Simulators (GNSs) offer
faster inference but suffer from two key limitations: Firstly, they must be
retrained from scratch for even minor variations in physical parameters, and
secondly they require labor-intensive data collection for each new parameter
setting. This is inefficient, as simulations with varying parameters often
share a common underlying latent structure. In this work, we address these
challenges by learning this shared structure through meta-learning, enabling
fast adaptation to new physical parameters without retraining. To this end, we
propose a novel architecture that generates a latent representation by encoding
graph trajectories using conditional neural processes (CNPs). To mitigate error
accumulation over time, we combine CNPs with a novel neural operator
architecture. We validate our approach, Meta Neural Graph Operator (MaNGO), on
several dynamics prediction tasks with varying material properties,
demonstrating superior performance over existing GNS methods. Notably, MaNGO
achieves accuracy on unseen material properties close to that of an oracle
model.

Abstract: GeoAI is evolving rapidly, fueled by diverse geospatial datasets like traffic
patterns, environmental data, and crowdsourced OpenStreetMap (OSM) information.
While sophisticated AI models are being developed, existing benchmarks are
often concentrated on single tasks and restricted to a single modality. As
such, progress in GeoAI is limited by the lack of a standardized, multi-task,
modality-agnostic benchmark for their systematic evaluation. This paper
introduces a novel benchmark designed to assess the performance, accuracy, and
efficiency of geospatial embedders. Our benchmark is modality-agnostic and
comprises 7 distinct datasets from diverse cities across three continents,
ensuring generalizability and mitigating demographic biases. It allows for the
evaluation of GeoAI embedders on various phenomena that exhibit underlying
geographic processes. Furthermore, we establish a simple and intuitive
task-oriented model baselines, providing a crucial reference point for
comparing more complex solutions.

Motivation: 现有后训练线性化方法存在关键缺陷：混合方法无意中绕过了线性组件，几乎完全依赖滑动窗口softmax，导致性能归因失效。

Method: 提出三种解决方案：(1) 推理时混合线性转换与滑动窗口softmax；(2) HedgeCATs方法，结合注意力权重转移和针对性LoRA微调；(3) 计划滑动窗口dropout(SSD)，在训练中随机抑制softmax分支以防止组件崩溃。

Conclusion: 通过平衡组件使用，成功解决了现有线性化方法中线性组件被绕过的问题，为Transformer线性化提供了更可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Transformers' quadratic computational complexity limits their scalability
despite remarkable performance. While linear attention reduces this to linear
complexity, pre-training such models from scratch remains, in most cases,
prohibitively expensive. Recent post-training linearisation methods convert
pre-trained Transformers to linear models efficiently, often using hybrid
approaches that combine linear attention with sliding-window softmax. We
identify a critical flaw: existing hybrid methods inadvertently bypass the
linear component, relying almost entirely on SWA. Component-level diagnostics
reveal this previously undetected behaviour stems from overlooked evaluation
practices on common-sense benchmarks. We propose three solutions to ensure
balanced component usage: (i) inference-time hybridisation of linear-only
conversions with sliding-window softmax; (ii) HedgeCATs, combining
attention-weight transfer with targeted LoRA fine-tuning; and (iii) Scheduled
Sliding-window Dropout (SSD), which stochastically suppresses the softmax
branch during training to prevent component collapse. Our methods maintain
computational efficiency while recovering most base model performance and
ensuring genuine linear attention adoption, restoring the validity of
performance attributions in hybrid conversions.

Conclusion: VAE-BiLSTM-MHA架构在ECG异常检测中表现优异，并集成到交互式仪表板中支持临床分诊

Abstract: Anomaly detection in 12-lead electrocardiograms (ECGs) is critical for
identifying deviations associated with cardiovascular disease. This work
presents a comparative analysis of three autoencoder-based architectures:
convolutional autoencoder (CAE), variational autoencoder with bidirectional
long short-term memory (VAE-BiLSTM), and VAE-BiLSTM with multi-head attention
(VAE-BiLSTM-MHA), for unsupervised anomaly detection in ECGs. To the best of
our knowledge, this study reports the first application of a VAE-BiLSTM-MHA
architecture to ECG anomaly detection. All models are trained on normal ECG
samples to reconstruct non-anomalous cardiac morphology and detect deviations
indicative of disease. Using a unified preprocessing and evaluation pipeline on
the public China Physiological Signal Challenge (CPSC) dataset, the
attention-augmented VAE achieves the best performance, with an AUPRC of 0.81
and a recall of 0.85 on the held-out test set, outperforming the other
architectures. To support clinical triage, this model is further integrated
into an interactive dashboard that visualizes anomaly localization. In
addition, a performance comparison with baseline models from the literature is
provided.

Result: 在多种数据集和神经网络架构上的实验表明，CDC-FM始终提供更好的质量-泛化权衡，在数据稀缺和非均匀采样场景下显著优于标准流匹配。

Conclusion: CDC-FM为研究生成模型中数据几何、泛化和记忆化之间的相互作用提供了数学框架，并提供了一个可轻松集成到现有流匹配流程中的鲁棒且可扩展的算法。

Abstract: Deep generative models often face a fundamental tradeoff: high sample quality
can come at the cost of memorisation, where the model reproduces training data
rather than generalising across the underlying data geometry. We introduce
Carr\'e du champ flow matching (CDC-FM), a generalisation of flow matching
(FM), that improves the quality-generalisation tradeoff by regularising the
probability path with a geometry-aware noise. Our method replaces the
homogeneous, isotropic noise in FM with a spatially varying, anisotropic
Gaussian noise whose covariance captures the local geometry of the latent data
manifold. We prove that this geometric noise can be optimally estimated from
the data and is scalable to large data. Further, we provide an extensive
experimental evaluation on diverse datasets (synthetic manifolds, point clouds,
single-cell genomics, animal motion capture, and images) as well as various
neural network architectures (MLPs, CNNs, and transformers). We demonstrate
that CDC-FM consistently offers a better quality-generalisation tradeoff. We
observe significant improvements over standard FM in data-scarce regimes and in
highly non-uniformly sampled datasets, which are often encountered in AI for
science applications. Our work provides a mathematical framework for studying
the interplay between data geometry, generalisation and memorisation in
generative models, as well as a robust and scalable algorithm that can be
readily integrated into existing flow matching pipelines.

Method: 设计多智能体架构，让多个LLM智能体扮演不同角色进行"辩论"，集体评估特征相关性并生成详细解释。

Abstract: High-dimensional data remains a pervasive challenge in machine learning,
often undermining model interpretability and computational efficiency. While
Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise for dimensionality reduction
through feature selection, existing LLM-based approaches frequently lack
structured reasoning and transparent justification for their decisions. This
paper introduces LLM-FS-Agent, a novel multi-agent architecture designed for
interpretable and robust feature selection. The system orchestrates a
deliberative "debate" among multiple LLM agents, each assigned a specific role,
enabling collective evaluation of feature relevance and generation of detailed
justifications. We evaluate LLM-FS-Agent in the cybersecurity domain using the
CIC-DIAD 2024 IoT intrusion detection dataset and compare its performance
against strong baselines, including LLM-Select and traditional methods such as
PCA. Experimental results demonstrate that LLM-FS-Agent consistently achieves
superior or comparable classification performance while reducing downstream
training time by an average of 46% (statistically significant improvement, p =
0.028 for XGBoost). These findings highlight that the proposed deliberative
architecture enhances both decision transparency and computational efficiency,
establishing LLM-FS-Agent as a practical and reliable solution for real-world
applications.

*Randall Balestriero,Nicolas Ballas,Mike Rabbat,Yann LeCun*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: JEPAs的防坍塌项不仅防止表示坍塌，还证明了能够估计数据密度，可用于数据筛选、异常检测和密度估计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 揭示JEPAs中防坍塌项的深层作用，证明其能够估计数据密度，扩展JEPAs的应用范围。

Method: 通过理论分析证明JEPAs的防坍塌项与数据密度估计的等价性，并提出使用模型在样本处的Jacobian矩阵高效计算学习概率的JEPA-SCORE方法。

Result: 在合成、受控和Imagenet数据集上验证了JEPA-SCORE的有效性，适用于I-JEPA、DINOv2等JEPA家族方法和MetaCLIP等多模态模型。

Conclusion: JEPAs不仅学习下游任务表示，还能提供数据密度估计，为数据管理、异常检测等应用提供了新工具。

Abstract: Joint Embedding Predictive Architectures (JEPAs) learn representations able
to solve numerous downstream tasks out-of-the-box. JEPAs combine two
objectives: (i) a latent-space prediction term, i.e., the representation of a
slightly perturbed sample must be predictable from the original sample's
representation, and (ii) an anti-collapse term, i.e., not all samples should
have the same representation. While (ii) is often considered as an obvious
remedy to representation collapse, we uncover that JEPAs' anti-collapse term
does much more--it provably estimates the data density. In short, any
successfully trained JEPA can be used to get sample probabilities, e.g., for
data curation, outlier detection, or simply for density estimation. Our
theoretical finding is agnostic of the dataset and architecture used--in any
case one can compute the learned probabilities of sample $x$ efficiently and in
closed-form using the model's Jacobian matrix at $x$. Our findings are
empirically validated across datasets (synthetic, controlled, and Imagenet) and
across different Self Supervised Learning methods falling under the JEPA family
(I-JEPA and DINOv2) and on multimodal models, such as MetaCLIP. We denote the
method extracting the JEPA learned density as {\bf JEPA-SCORE}.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于正确性而非置信度的解码策略，通过Greedy-Threshold、Calibrated-TopK和Calibrated-epsilon等方法，在大语言模型的复杂推理任务中平衡探索性和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在扩展推理任务中存在矛盾：一方面需要增加随机性来探索多种推理路径，另一方面又要确保每条路径的质量。传统方法将置信度与答案质量等同，但实际上置信度和正确性是不同的不确定性来源。

Method: 提出基于正确性校准的解码规则：在估计正确性高的token上采样，在预期正确性低的地方减少采样。具体方法包括：Greedy-Threshold（在低置信度步骤进行贪婪采样）、Calibrated-TopK和Calibrated-epsilon（基于估计的按排名正确性设置截断阈值）。

Result: 在数学和通用推理基准测试中显示出性能提升，挑战了关于不确定性下解码的普遍启发式方法。

Conclusion: 解码策略应该基于正确性而非置信度进行校准，这种方法能够更好地平衡大语言模型在复杂推理任务中的探索性和准确性需求。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly applied to complex tasks that
require extended reasoning. In such settings, models often benefit from diverse
chains-of-thought to arrive at multiple candidate solutions. This requires two
competing objectives: to inject enough stochasticity to explore multiple
reasoning chains, and to ensure sufficient accuracy and quality in each path.
Existing works pursue the first objective by increasing exploration at highly
uncertain steps with higher temperature or larger candidate token sets, while
others improve reliability by rejecting samples with low confidence
post-generation, implying that low confidence correlates with low answer
quality. These two lines of thought are in conflict, as they conflate different
sources of uncertainty. To resolve this, we argue that the decoding rule should
be calibrated by correctness, not confidence alone. We should sample from
tokens with higher estimated correctness, and reduce sampling where expected
correctness is low. We propose simple strategies that achieve this goal:
Greedy-Threshold makes sampling greedy at very low confidence steps.
Calibrated-TopK and Calibrated-epsilon set truncation threshold based on
estimated rank-wise correctness. Together, our findings challenge prevailing
heuristics about decoding under uncertainty and show gains across math and
general reasoning benchmarks.

Result: 仅使用合成数据训练，在真实实验数据上表现出强大的零样本泛化能力，显著优于现有基线方法

Conclusion: 正式科学规则可作为强大的归纳偏置，在数据受限的科学领域实现鲁棒的自监督学习

Abstract: Transferring the recent advancements in deep learning into scientific
disciplines is hindered by the lack of the required large-scale datasets for
training. We argue that in these knowledge-rich domains, the established body
of scientific theory provides reliable inductive biases in the form of
governing physical laws. We address the ill-posed inverse problem of recovering
Raman spectra from noisy Coherent Anti-Stokes Raman Scattering (CARS)
measurements, as the true Raman signal here is suppressed by a dominating
non-resonant background. We propose RamPINN, a model that learns to recover
Raman spectra from given CARS spectra. Our core methodological contribution is
a physics-informed neural network that utilizes a dual-decoder architecture to
disentangle resonant and non-resonant signals. This is done by enforcing the
Kramers-Kronig causality relations via a differentiable Hilbert transform loss
on the resonant and a smoothness prior on the non-resonant part of the signal.
Trained entirely on synthetic data, RamPINN demonstrates strong zero-shot
generalization to real-world experimental data, explicitly closing this gap and
significantly outperforming existing baselines. Furthermore, we show that
training with these physics-based losses alone, without access to any
ground-truth Raman spectra, still yields competitive results. This work
highlights a broader concept: formal scientific rules can act as a potent
inductive bias, enabling robust, self-supervised learning in data-limited
scientific domains.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: OOD检测对AI可靠性至关重要，但实际应用中训练数据有限。贝叶斯神经网络能显式表示认知不确定性，在小样本场景下尤其有价值

Method: 引入基于预期logit向量的贝叶斯后验OOD评分家族，比较5种贝叶斯和4种确定性后验OOD评分方法

Result: 在MNIST和CIFAR-10数据集上，使用5000个或更少训练样本的实验表明，贝叶斯方法优于相应的确定性方法

Conclusion: 贝叶斯方法在小样本OOD检测任务中表现更优

Abstract: Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection is critical to AI reliability and safety,
yet in many practical settings, only a limited amount of training data is
available. Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs) are a promising class of model on
which to base OOD detection, because they explicitly represent epistemic (i.e.
model) uncertainty. In the small training data regime, BNNs are especially
valuable because they can incorporate prior model information. We introduce a
new family of Bayesian posthoc OOD scores based on expected logit vectors, and
compare 5 Bayesian and 4 deterministic posthoc OOD scores. Experiments on MNIST
and CIFAR-10 In-Distributions, with 5000 training samples or less, show that
the Bayesian methods outperform corresponding deterministic methods.

Motivation: 研究在过参数化插值机制下，即使对于随机标签等不可能数据也能获得低训练误差时，Gibbs算法的泛化性能。

Method: 使用数据依赖的界限来分析Gibbs算法在过参数化插值机制下的测试误差，并通过Langevin Monte Carlo算法进行近似稳定性分析。

Result: 在MNIST和CIFAR-10数据集上的实验表明，这些界限能够对真实标记数据产生非平凡预测，并正确上界随机标签的测试误差。

Conclusion: 在低温度插值机制下的泛化性能已经可以通过更经典的高温度机制中的小训练误差来预示。

Abstract: The paper provides data-dependent bounds on the test error of the Gibbs
algorithm in the overparameterized interpolation regime, where low training
errors are also obtained for impossible data, such as random labels in
classification. The bounds are stable under approximation with Langevin Monte
Carlo algorithms. Experiments on the MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets verify that
the bounds yield nontrivial predictions on true labeled data and correctly
upper bound the test error for random labels. Our method indicates that
generalization in the low-temperature, interpolation regime is already signaled
by small training errors in the more classical high temperature regime.

Motivation: 为了解决分子表示方法在交叉验证中可能出现的特征泄露问题，并降低留一法验证的计算成本，开发一种既高效又能保持无偏性能评估的分子表示方法。

Method: 提出molFTP表示方法，采用虚拟掩码程序移除保留分子中片段的信息以防止特征泄露，并使用key-loo方法近似分子级留一法验证。

Result: molFTP具有强大的预测性能，key-loo与真实分子级留一法的偏差低于8%，能够实现近乎全数据训练同时保持无偏的交叉验证性能估计。

Conclusion: molFTP提供了一种快速、防泄露的片段-靶标流行度向量化方法，通过虚拟掩码或key-loo等实用保护措施，以较低成本近似留一法验证效果。

Abstract: We introduce molFTP (molecular fragment-target prevalence), a compact
representation that delivers strong predictive performance. To prevent feature
leakage across cross-validation folds, we implement a dummy-masking procedure
that removes information about fragments present in the held-out molecules. We
further show that key leave-one-out (key-loo) closely approximates true
molecule-level leave-one-out (LOO), with deviation below 8% on our datasets.
This enables near full data training while preserving unbiased cross-validation
estimates of model performance. Overall, molFTP provides a fast,
leakage-resistant fragment-target prevalence vectorization with practical
safeguards (dummy masking or key-LOO) that approximate LOO at a fraction of its
cost.

Conclusion: H-DSAC方法成功地将人类指导融入强化学习过程，为真实世界自动驾驶提供了安全有效的学习方案。

Abstract: Autonomous driving with reinforcement learning (RL) has significant
potential. However, applying RL in real-world settings remains challenging due
to the need for safe, efficient, and robust learning. Incorporating human
expertise into the learning process can help overcome these challenges by
reducing risky exploration and improving sample efficiency. In this work, we
propose a reward-free, active human-in-the-loop learning method called
Human-Guided Distributional Soft Actor-Critic (H-DSAC). Our method combines
Proxy Value Propagation (PVP) and Distributional Soft Actor-Critic (DSAC) to
enable efficient and safe training in real-world environments. The key
innovation is the construction of a distributed proxy value function within the
DSAC framework. This function encodes human intent by assigning higher expected
returns to expert demonstrations and penalizing actions that require human
intervention. By extrapolating these labels to unlabeled states, the policy is
effectively guided toward expert-like behavior. With a well-designed state
space, our method achieves real-world driving policy learning within practical
training times. Results from both simulation and real-world experiments
demonstrate that our framework enables safe, robust, and sample-efficient
learning for autonomous driving.

TL;DR: BLISS是一种轻量级数据选择方法，无需依赖外部预训练模型，通过双层优化框架估计训练样本的长期影响，从而为LLM预训练选择高质量数据。


<details>

Motivation: 现有数据选择方法通常依赖外部预训练模型，难以分离数据选择效果与外部模型的影响，且忽视了数据在模型完全收敛时的长期影响。

Method: 使用小型代理模型作为LLM替代，通过双层优化训练评分模型：上层优化评分模型为训练样本分配权重，下层优化代理模型在加权损失上训练至收敛，确保最佳验证性能。

Result: 在410M/1B/2.8B Pythia和LLaMA-0.5B模型上验证，1B模型设置下比现有最佳方法快1.7倍达到相同性能，在多个下游任务上表现优异。

Conclusion: BLISS提供了一种无需外部模型的有效数据选择方法，显著提升预训练效率，为LLM数据选择提供了新思路。

Abstract: Effective data selection is essential for pretraining large language models
(LLMs), enhancing efficiency and improving generalization to downstream tasks.
However, existing approaches often require leveraging external pretrained
models, making it difficult to disentangle the effects of data selection from
those of the external pretrained models. In addition, they often overlook the
long-term impact of selected data if the model is trained to convergence,
primarily due to the prohibitive cost of full-scale LLM pretraining. In this
paper, we introduce BLISS (\textbf{B}ileve\textbf{L} \textbf{I}nfluence
\textbf{S}coring method for data \textbf{S}election): a lightweight data
selection method that operates entirely \emph{from scratch}, without relying on
any external pretrained oracle models, while explicitly accounting for the
long-term impact of selected data. BLISS leverages a small proxy model as a
surrogate for the LLM and employs a score model to estimate the long-term
influence of training samples if the proxy model is trained to convergence. We
formulate data selection as a bilevel optimization problem, where the
upper-level objective optimizes the score model to assign importance weights to
training samples, ensuring that minimizing the lower-level objective (i.e.,
training the proxy model over the weighted training loss until convergence)
leads to best validation performance. Once optimized, the trained score model
predicts influence scores for the dataset, enabling efficient selection of
high-quality samples for LLM pretraining. We validate BLISS by pretraining
410M/1B/2.8B Pythia and LLaMA-0.5B models on selected subsets of the C4
dataset. Notably, under the 1B model setting, BLISS achieves $1.7\times$
speedup in reaching the same performance as the state-of-the-art method,
demonstrating superior performance across multiple downstream tasks.

Conclusion: 编辑流过程为时间点过程提供了一种灵活高效的生成模型，有效减少了生成所需的编辑操作数量。

Abstract: Temporal point processes (TPPs) are a fundamental tool for modeling event
sequences in continuous time, but most existing approaches rely on
autoregressive parameterizations that are limited by their sequential sampling.
Recent non-autoregressive, diffusion-style models mitigate these issues by
jointly interpolating between noise and data through event insertions and
deletions in a discrete Markov chain. In this work, we generalize this
perspective and introduce an Edit Flow process for TPPs that transports noise
to data via insert, delete, and substitute edit operations. By learning the
instantaneous edit rates within a continuous-time Markov chain framework, we
attain a flexible and efficient model that effectively reduces the total number
of necessary edit operations during generation. Empirical results demonstrate
the generative flexibility of our unconditionally trained model in a wide range
of unconditional and conditional generation tasks on benchmark TPPs.

Abstract: In this paper, we study the factors that contribute to the effect of
oversmoothing in deep Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). Specifically, our analysis
is based on a new metric (Mean Average Squared Distance - $MASED$) to quantify
the extent of oversmoothing. We derive layer-wise bounds on $MASED$, which
aggregate to yield global upper and lower distance bounds. Based on this
quantification of oversmoothing, we further analyze the importance of two
different properties of the model; namely the norms of the generated node
embeddings, along with the largest and smallest singular values of the weight
matrices. Building on the insights drawn from the theoretical analysis, we show
that oversmoothing increases as the number of trainable weight matrices and the
number of adjacency matrices increases. We also use the derived layer-wise
bounds on $MASED$ to form a proposal for decoupling the number of hops (i.e.,
adjacency depth) from the number of weight matrices. In particular, we
introduce G-Reg, a regularization scheme that increases the bounds, and
demonstrate through extensive experiments that by doing so node classification
accuracy increases, achieving robustness at large depths. We further show that
by reducing oversmoothing in deep networks, we can achieve better results in
some tasks than using shallow ones. Specifically, we experiment with a ``cold
start" scenario, i.e., when there is no feature information for the unlabeled
nodes. Finally, we show empirically the trade-off between receptive field size
(i.e., number of weight matrices) and performance, using the $MASED$ bounds.
This is achieved by distributing adjacency hops across a small number of
trainable layers, avoiding the extremes of under- or over-parameterization of
the GNN.

Result: OpenAI模型和Gemini 2.5 Flash在计数任务上表现良好（准确率90%+），但在定位相关任务上表现不佳（精确率和召回率接近或低于50%）。图表设计对性能影响较小，但应避免宽高比散点图（16:9和21:9）或随机着色的散点图。

Conclusion: 当前AI模型在散点图分析中适用于计数任务，但不适用于定位任务。建议避免使用宽高比散点图或随机着色的散点图以获得更好的性能。

Abstract: AI models are increasingly used for data analysis and visualization, yet
benchmarks rarely address scatterplot-specific tasks, limiting insight into
performance. To address this gap for one of the most common chart types, we
introduce a synthetic, annotated dataset of over 18,000 scatterplots from six
data generators and 17 chart designs, and a benchmark based on it. We evaluate
proprietary models from OpenAI and Google using N-shot prompting on five
distinct tasks derived from annotations of cluster bounding boxes, their center
coordinates, and outlier coordinates. OpenAI models and Gemini 2.5 Flash,
especially when prompted with examples, are viable options for counting
clusters and, in Flash's case, outliers (90%+ Accuracy). However, the results
for localization-related tasks are unsatisfactory: Precision and Recall are
near or below 50%, except for Flash in outlier identification (65.01%).
Furthermore, the impact of chart design on performance appears to be a
secondary factor, but it is advisable to avoid scatterplots with wide aspect
ratios (16:9 and 21:9) or those colored randomly. Supplementary materials are

Motivation: 线性动态系统混合模型在复杂噪声环境下的应用受限，现有张量方法对噪声敏感，EM方法对初始化敏感且易陷入局部最优。

Method: 使用输入输出数据构建矩张量来恢复混合权重和系统参数的全局一致估计，然后通过卡尔曼EM算法进行细化。

Result: 在合成数据上比纯张量或随机初始化EM方法更可靠；在真实神经数据中成功建模和聚类不同条件为独立子系统。

Conclusion: MoLDS是建模复杂神经数据的有效框架，Tensor-EM是学习MoLDS的可靠方法。

Abstract: Mixtures of linear dynamical systems (MoLDS) provide a path to model
time-series data that exhibit diverse temporal dynamics across trajectories.
However, its application remains challenging in complex and noisy settings,
limiting its effectiveness for neural data analysis. Tensor-based moment
methods can provide global identifiability guarantees for MoLDS, but their
performance degrades under noise and complexity. Commonly used
expectation-maximization (EM) methods offer flexibility in fitting latent
models but are highly sensitive to initialization and prone to poor local
minima. Here, we propose a tensor-based method that provides identifiability
guarantees for learning MoLDS, which is followed by EM updates to combine the
strengths of both approaches. The novelty in our approach lies in the
construction of moment tensors using the input-output data to recover globally
consistent estimates of mixture weights and system parameters. These estimates
can then be refined through a Kalman EM algorithm, with closed-form updates for
all LDS parameters. We validate our framework on synthetic benchmarks and
real-world datasets. On synthetic data, the proposed Tensor-EM method achieves
more reliable recovery and improved robustness compared to either pure tensor
or randomly initialized EM methods. We then analyze neural recordings from the
primate somatosensory cortex while a non-human primate performs reaches in
different directions. Our method successfully models and clusters different
conditions as separate subsystems, consistent with supervised single-LDS fits
for each condition. Finally, we apply this approach to another neural dataset
where monkeys perform a sequential reaching task. These results demonstrate
that MoLDS provides an effective framework for modeling complex neural data,
and that Tensor-EM is a reliable approach to MoLDS learning for these
applications.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于失败感知的逆向强化学习算法，专注于被错误分类或难以判断的样本，以更准确地提取RLHF中的潜在奖励信号。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RLHF虽然能对齐大语言模型与人类偏好，但其内部学习的奖励信号难以解释，现有IRL方法对所有偏好对一视同仁，忽略了最具信息量的失败样本。

Method: 开发失败感知IRL算法，重点关注被提取的奖励模型错误分类或评分接近的样本，通过这些失败样本来恢复定义模型行为的潜在奖励。

Result: 在LLM去毒任务中，失败感知IRL在多个指标上优于现有IRL基线，无需外部分类器或监督，提取的奖励能更好地反映RLHF的真实目标。

Conclusion: 失败感知IRL是审核模型对齐和减少IRL过程模糊性的稳健、可扩展方法，能更有效地支持重新RLHF训练。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) aligns Large Language
Models (LLMs) with human preferences, yet the underlying reward signals they
internalize remain hidden, posing a critical challenge for interpretability and
safety. Existing approaches attempt to extract these latent incentives using
Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL), but treat all preference pairs equally,
often overlooking the most informative signals: those examples the extracted
reward model misclassifies or assigns nearly equal scores, which we term
\emph{failures}. We introduce a novel \emph{failure-aware} IRL algorithm that
focuses on misclassified or difficult examples to recover the latent rewards
defining model behaviors. By learning from these failures, our failure-aware
IRL extracts reward functions that better reflect the true objectives behind
RLHF. We demonstrate that failure-aware IRL outperforms existing IRL baselines
across multiple metrics when applied to LLM detoxification, without requiring
external classifiers or supervision. Crucially, failure-aware IRL yields
rewards that better capture the true incentives learned during RLHF, enabling
more effective re-RLHF training than standard IRL. This establishes
failure-aware IRL as a robust, scalable method for auditing model alignment and
reducing ambiguity in the IRL process.

*Matthieu Bou,Nyal Patel,Arjun Jagota,Satyapriya Krishna,Sonali Parbhoo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一个基于贝叶斯逆强化学习的LLM目标审计框架，通过量化非可识别性、提供不确定性诊断和验证策略级效用来增强LLM对齐的可信度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型隐式优化的目标不透明，使得可信对齐和审计成为重大挑战。现有逆强化学习方法要么产生单一、过度自信的奖励估计，要么未能解决任务的基本模糊性（非可识别性）。

Method: 采用贝叶斯逆强化学习方法，不仅恢复目标分布，还实现三个关键审计能力：量化并系统减少非可识别性、提供可操作的不确定性诊断、验证策略级效用。

Result: 框架成功审计了一个去毒化的LLM，产生了良好校准和可解释的目标，增强了对齐保证。经验验证表明，精炼的低不确定性奖励可以直接用于RLHF，实现与真实对齐过程相当的训练动态和毒性降低。

Conclusion: 这项工作为审计人员、安全团队和监管机构提供了一个实用工具包，用于验证LLM真正试图实现的目标，推动AI向更可信和可问责的方向发展。

Abstract: The objectives that Large Language Models (LLMs) implicitly optimize remain
dangerously opaque, making trustworthy alignment and auditing a grand
challenge. While Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) can infer reward
functions from behaviour, existing approaches either produce a single,
overconfident reward estimate or fail to address the fundamental ambiguity of
the task (non-identifiability). This paper introduces a principled auditing
framework that re-frames reward inference from a simple estimation task to a
comprehensive process for verification. Our framework leverages Bayesian IRL to
not only recover a distribution over objectives but to enable three critical
audit capabilities: (i) Quantifying and systematically reducing
non-identifiability by demonstrating posterior contraction over sequential
rounds of evidence; (ii) Providing actionable, uncertainty-aware diagnostics
that expose spurious shortcuts and identify out-of-distribution prompts where
the inferred objective cannot be trusted; and (iii) Validating policy-level
utility by showing that the refined, low-uncertainty reward can be used
directly in RLHF to achieve training dynamics and toxicity reductions
comparable to the ground-truth alignment process. Empirically, our framework
successfully audits a detoxified LLM, yielding a well-calibrated and
interpretable objective that strengthens alignment guarantees. Overall, this
work provides a practical toolkit for auditors, safety teams, and regulators to
verify what LLMs are truly trying to achieve, moving us toward more trustworthy
and accountable AI.

Motivation: 深度神经网络在统计上难以学习高维任务，但实际上却能成功，这表明可学习数据必须具有潜在的底层结构。论文旨在揭示这种结构的本质及其对性能的影响。

Method: 通过研究数据、任务和深度学习表示中的局部性和组合性作用来分析神经网络的学习机制。

Result: 论文发现局部性和组合性是深度神经网络能够有效学习高维任务的关键结构特性。

Conclusion: 数据的局部性和组合性结构使深度神经网络能够克服维度诅咒，实现高效学习和泛化。

Abstract: Deep neural networks have achieved remarkable success, yet our understanding
of how they learn remains limited. These models can learn high-dimensional
tasks, which is generally statistically intractable due to the curse of
dimensionality. This apparent paradox suggests that learnable data must have an
underlying latent structure. What is the nature of this structure? How do
neural networks encode and exploit it, and how does it quantitatively impact
performance - for instance, how does generalization improve with the number of
training examples? This thesis addresses these questions by studying the roles
of locality and compositionality in data, tasks, and deep learning
representations.

TL;DR: 该论文提出使用影响函数来定义推理数据质量，并引入基于影响的剪枝方法，在数学推理任务中优于基于困惑度和嵌入的基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有推理方法依赖问题难度或轨迹长度等间接启发式方法，而指令调优虽然探索了更广泛的自动选择策略，但很少在推理背景下应用。什么构成"质量"推理数据仍不明确。

Method: 使用影响函数来衡量单个思维链示例对下游准确性的因果效应，并引入基于影响的剪枝方法。

Result: 在模型家族内的数学推理任务中，基于影响的剪枝方法始终优于基于困惑度和嵌入的基线方法。

Conclusion: 影响函数可以有效定义推理数据质量，基于影响的剪枝方法在数学推理任务中表现优异。

Abstract: Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) on chain-of-thought (CoT) data shows
that a small amount of high-quality data can outperform massive datasets. Yet,
what constitutes "quality" remains ill-defined. Existing reasoning methods rely
on indirect heuristics such as problem difficulty or trace length, while
instruction-tuning has explored a broader range of automated selection
strategies, but rarely in the context of reasoning. We propose to define
reasoning data quality using influence functions, which measure the causal
effect of individual CoT examples on downstream accuracy, and introduce
influence-based pruning, which consistently outperforms perplexity and
embedding-based baselines on math reasoning within a model family.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了PolyGraph Discrepancy (PGD)框架，通过二元分类器近似图分布的Jensen-Shannon距离，解决了现有基于MMD的图生成模型评估方法的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的图生成模型评估方法主要依赖基于图描述符的MMD指标，这些指标只能相对排序模型，无法提供绝对性能度量，且对核函数和描述符参数化高度敏感，导致不同描述符间的结果不可比较。

Method: 通过拟合二元分类器来区分真实图和生成图，使用图描述符作为特征。分类器的数据对数似然近似于两个分布间JS距离的变分下界。

Result: PGD指标被约束在单位区间[0,1]内，可在不同图描述符间进行比较。实验表明PGD比MMD指标提供更鲁棒和深入的评估。

Conclusion: PGD框架解决了现有图生成模型评估方法的局限性，提供了更可靠和可比较的评估指标，相关代码已公开。

Abstract: Existing methods for evaluating graph generative models primarily rely on
Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) metrics based on graph descriptors. While these
metrics can rank generative models, they do not provide an absolute measure of
performance. Their values are also highly sensitive to extrinsic parameters,
namely kernel and descriptor parametrization, making them incomparable across
different graph descriptors. We introduce PolyGraph Discrepancy (PGD), a new
evaluation framework that addresses these limitations. It approximates the
Jensen-Shannon distance of graph distributions by fitting binary classifiers to
distinguish between real and generated graphs, featurized by these descriptors.
The data log-likelihood of these classifiers approximates a variational lower
bound on the JS distance between the two distributions. Resulting metrics are
constrained to the unit interval [0,1] and are comparable across different
graph descriptors. We further derive a theoretically grounded summary metric
that combines these individual metrics to provide a maximally tight lower bound
on the distance for the given descriptors. Thorough experiments demonstrate
that PGD provides a more robust and insightful evaluation compared to MMD
metrics. The PolyGraph framework for benchmarking graph generative models is
made publicly available at https://github.com/BorgwardtLab/polygraph-benchmark.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种评估压缩模型忠实度的新方法，超越了传统的准确率指标，通过模型一致性和卡方检验来检测压缩后模型行为的变化，特别是在不同人口统计子组中的预测模式变化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实应用中，模型压缩技术虽然能减小模型大小和计算成本，但传统评估只关注大小与准确率的权衡，忽视了模型忠实度。在高风险领域如医疗、金融和刑事司法中，压缩模型必须保持与原模型行为的一致性。

Method: 引入一组忠实度指标，包括使用模型一致性评估预测一致性，应用卡方检验检测整体数据集和人口统计子组中预测模式的统计显著变化。在三个具有社会意义的数据集上对人工神经网络应用量化和剪枝进行验证。

Result: 研究发现高准确率不能保证忠实度，统计测试检测到了标准指标（如准确率和均等几率）遗漏的细微但显著的变化。

Conclusion: 提出的指标提供了一种实用且更直接的方法，确保通过压缩获得的效率提升不会损害可信AI所必需的公平性或忠实度。

Abstract: In real-world applications, computational constraints often require
transforming large models into smaller, more efficient versions through model
compression. While these techniques aim to reduce size and computational cost
without sacrificing performance, their evaluations have traditionally focused
on the trade-off between size and accuracy, overlooking the aspect of model
faithfulness. This limited view is insufficient for high-stakes domains like
healthcare, finance, and criminal justice, where compressed models must remain
faithful to the behavior of their original counterparts. This paper presents a
novel approach to evaluating faithfulness in compressed models, moving beyond
standard metrics. We introduce and demonstrate a set of faithfulness metrics
that capture how model behavior changes post-compression. Our contributions
include introducing techniques to assess predictive consistency between the
original and compressed models using model agreement, and applying chi-squared
tests to detect statistically significant changes in predictive patterns across
both the overall dataset and demographic subgroups, thereby exposing shifts
that aggregate fairness metrics may obscure. We demonstrate our approaches by
applying quantization and pruning to artificial neural networks (ANNs) trained
on three diverse and socially meaningful datasets. Our findings show that high
accuracy does not guarantee faithfulness, and our statistical tests detect
subtle yet significant shifts that are missed by standard metrics, such as
Accuracy and Equalized Odds. The proposed metrics provide a practical and more
direct method for ensuring that efficiency gains through compression do not
compromise the fairness or faithfulness essential for trustworthy AI.

*Haoxin Wang,Xiaolong Tu,Hongyu Ke,Huirong Chai,Dawei Chen,Kyungtae Han*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了lm-Meter，第一个专为设备端LLM推理设计的轻量级在线延迟分析器，能够在不使用辅助设备的情况下捕获细粒度的实时延迟，为设备端LLM系统的优化提供关键洞察。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM在日常应用中的集成度提高，基于云的部署方式引发了数据隐私和可持续性担忧。在移动和边缘设备上本地运行LLM可以增强隐私性、可靠性和降低通信成本，但由于内存和计算需求大，以及在资源受限硬件上性能效率权衡的可见性有限，实现这一愿景仍然具有挑战性。

Method: 开发了lm-Meter，这是一个轻量级的在线延迟分析器，能够在阶段级别（如嵌入、预填充、解码、softmax、采样）和内核级别捕获细粒度的实时延迟，无需辅助设备。在商用移动平台上实现了该系统，并展示了其高分析精度和低系统开销。

Result: lm-Meter在商用移动平台上实现了高精度的性能分析，在最具约束的Powersave调控器下，预填充阶段的吞吐量仅降低2.58%，解码阶段仅降低0.99%。通过lm-Meter进行的实证研究揭示了设备端LLM推理中的阶段和内核级瓶颈，量化了精度效率权衡，并识别了系统性优化机会。

Conclusion: lm-Meter为受限平台上LLM的运行时行为提供了前所未有的可见性，为知情优化奠定了基础，并加速了设备端LLM系统的民主化进程。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly integrated into everyday
applications, but their prevalent cloud-based deployment raises growing
concerns around data privacy and long-term sustainability. Running LLMs locally
on mobile and edge devices (on-device LLMs) offers the promise of enhanced
privacy, reliability, and reduced communication costs. However, realizing this
vision remains challenging due to substantial memory and compute demands, as
well as limited visibility into performance-efficiency trade-offs on
resource-constrained hardware. We propose lm-Meter, the first lightweight,
online latency profiler tailored for on-device LLM inference. lm-Meter captures
fine-grained, real-time latency at both phase (e.g., embedding, prefill,
decode, softmax, sampling) and kernel levels without auxiliary devices. We
implement lm-Meter on commercial mobile platforms and demonstrate its high
profiling accuracy with minimal system overhead, e.g., only 2.58% throughput
reduction in prefill and 0.99% in decode under the most constrained Powersave
governor. Leveraging lm-Meter, we conduct comprehensive empirical studies
revealing phase- and kernel-level bottlenecks in on-device LLM inference,
quantifying accuracy-efficiency trade-offs, and identifying systematic
optimization opportunities. lm-Meter provides unprecedented visibility into the
runtime behavior of LLMs on constrained platforms, laying the foundation for
informed optimization and accelerating the democratization of on-device LLM
systems. Code and tutorials are available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多任务强化学习通常依赖任务元数据（如自然语言描述）来指导不同目标的行为，需要一种能够有效利用语言信息来索引和组合可重用技能的方法。

Method: 提出LEXPOL架构，使用文本编码器编码任务元数据，通过学习的门控模块选择和混合多个子策略，支持端到端跨任务训练。

Result: 在MetaWorld基准测试中，LEXPOL在成功率和样本效率方面达到或超过强大多任务基线，无需任务特定重训练。学习到的语言门控能够组合专家策略以处理新任务描述和未见任务组合。

Conclusion: 自然语言元数据可以有效地在单一策略中索引和重组可重用技能，为多任务强化学习提供了有效的语言条件控制机制。

Abstract: Multi-task reinforcement learning often relies on task metadata -- such as
brief natural-language descriptions -- to guide behavior across diverse
objectives. We present Lexical Policy Networks (LEXPOL), a language-conditioned
mixture-of-policies architecture for multi-task RL. LEXPOL encodes task
metadata with a text encoder and uses a learned gating module to select or
blend among multiple sub-policies, enabling end-to-end training across tasks.
On MetaWorld benchmarks, LEXPOL matches or exceeds strong multi-task baselines
in success rate and sample efficiency, without task-specific retraining. To
analyze the mechanism, we further study settings with fixed expert policies
obtained independently of the gate and show that the learned language gate
composes these experts to produce behaviors appropriate to novel task
descriptions and unseen task combinations. These results indicate that
natural-language metadata can effectively index and recombine reusable skills
within a single policy.

*Aleksandar Armacki,Ali H. Sayed*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文研究了去中心化随机梯度下降（DSGD）算法在高概率（HP）意义下的收敛性，消除了对梯度一致有界等强假设，在轻尾噪声条件下实现了与均方误差（MSE）收敛相同的条件，并获得了线性加速效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有去中心化设置中的高概率收敛研究需要强假设条件（如梯度一致有界或渐近消失噪声），导致HP收敛与MSE收敛的假设条件存在显著差距，这与集中式设置中SGD在相同条件下同时实现HP和MSE收敛的情况形成对比。

Method: 通过仔细分析感兴趣量（梯度范数平方或最优性间隙）的矩生成函数（MGF）以及用户模型间共识间隙的MGF，提供了去中心化方法在HP意义下的方差缩减效应新结果，并对强凸成本函数给出了更精细的MGF边界。

Result: 证明了DSGD在轻尾噪声下，在非凸和强凸成本函数上都能实现HP收敛，且达到阶最优收敛速率，同时获得用户数量的线性加速效果，匹配现有的MSE保证。

Conclusion: 该研究填补了去中心化设置中HP收敛与MSE收敛假设条件的差距，证明了DSGD在HP意义上保持强性能，并提供了对去中心化方法方差缩减效应的新理解。

Abstract: Convergence in high-probability (HP) has been receiving increasing interest,
due to its attractive properties, such as exponentially decaying tail bounds
and strong guarantees for each individual run of an algorithm. While HP
guarantees are extensively studied in centralized settings, much less is
understood in the decentralized, networked setup. Existing HP studies in
decentralized settings impose strong assumptions, like uniformly bounded
gradients, or asymptotically vanishing noise, resulting in a significant gap
between assumptions used to establish convergence in the HP and the
mean-squared error (MSE) sense, even for vanilla Decentralized Stochastic
Gradient Descent ($\mathtt{DSGD}$) algorithm. This is contrary to centralized
settings, where it is known that $\mathtt{SGD}$ converges in HP under the same
conditions on the cost function as needed to guarantee MSE convergence.
Motivated by this observation, we revisit HP guarantees for $\mathtt{DSGD}$ in
the presence of light-tailed noise. We show that $\mathtt{DSGD}$ converges in
HP under the same conditions on the cost as in the MSE sense, removing
uniformly bounded gradients and other restrictive assumptions, while
simultaneously achieving order-optimal rates for both non-convex and strongly
convex costs. Moreover, our improved analysis yields linear speed-up in the
number of users, demonstrating that $\mathtt{DSGD}$ maintains strong
performance in the HP sense and matches existing MSE guarantees. Our improved
results stem from a careful analysis of the MGF of quantities of interest
(norm-squared of gradient or optimality gap) and the MGF of the consensus gap
between users' models. To achieve linear speed-up, we provide a novel result on
the variance-reduction effect of decentralized methods in the HP sense and more
fine-grained bounds on the MGF for strongly convex costs, which are both of
independent interest.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法依赖昂贵的人工参与数据，限制了可扩展性。需要一种可扩展的方法来模拟人类决策，以训练智能体与策略不可访问的队友协作。

Method: 在受Stag Hunt启发的网格世界捕获游戏中进行了三个实验：比较人类参与者、专家与LLM的决策；通过提示诱导风险敏感策略；在动态网格世界中测试LLM生成移动动作。

Result: LLM决策与专家更一致；通过提示可模拟人类风险行为变化；LLM生成的轨迹与人类参与者路径相似。

Conclusion: 虽然LLM尚不能完全复制人类适应性，但其提示引导的多样性为模拟策略不可知队友提供了可扩展基础。

Abstract: A critical challenge in modelling Heterogeneous-Agent Teams is training
agents to collaborate with teammates whose policies are inaccessible or
non-stationary, such as humans. Traditional approaches rely on expensive
human-in-the-loop data, which limits scalability. We propose using Large
Language Models (LLMs) as policy-agnostic human proxies to generate synthetic
data that mimics human decision-making. To evaluate this, we conduct three
experiments in a grid-world capture game inspired by Stag Hunt, a game theory
paradigm that balances risk and reward. In Experiment 1, we compare decisions
from 30 human participants and 2 expert judges with outputs from LLaMA 3.1 and
Mixtral 8x22B models. LLMs, prompted with game-state observations and reward
structures, align more closely with experts than participants, demonstrating
consistency in applying underlying decision criteria. Experiment 2 modifies
prompts to induce risk-sensitive strategies (e.g. "be risk averse"). LLM
outputs mirror human participants' variability, shifting between risk-averse
and risk-seeking behaviours. Finally, Experiment 3 tests LLMs in a dynamic
grid-world where the LLM agents generate movement actions. LLMs produce
trajectories resembling human participants' paths. While LLMs cannot yet fully
replicate human adaptability, their prompt-guided diversity offers a scalable
foundation for simulating policy-agnostic teammates.

Conclusion: 基于先验信息的适应是增强基础模型处理高维数据能力的有效方法，为未来生物医学研究提供了新的起点。

Abstract: Revealing novel insights from the relationship between molecular measurements
and pathology remains a very impactful application of machine learning in
biomedicine. Data in this domain typically contain only a few observations but
thousands of potentially noisy features, posing challenges for conventional
machine learning approaches. While prior-data fitted networks emerge as
foundation models for tabular data, they are currently not suited to handle
large feature counts (>500). Although feature reduction enables their
application, it hinders feature importance analysis. We propose a strategy that
extends existing models through continued pre-training on synthetic data
sampled from a customized prior. The resulting model, TabPFN-Wide, matches or
exceeds its base model's performance while exhibiting improved robustness to
noise. It seamlessly scales beyond 50,000 features, regardless of noise levels,
while maintaining inherent interpretability, which is critical for biomedical
applications. Our results show that prior-informed adaptation is suitable to
enhance the capability of foundation models for high-dimensional data. On
real-world biomedical datasets many of the most relevant features identified by
the model overlap with previous biological findings, while others propose
potential starting points for future studies.

Abstract: Feature attributions are post-training analysis methods that assess how
various input features of a machine learning model contribute to an output
prediction. Their interpretation is straightforward when features act
independently, but becomes less direct when the predictive model involves
interactions such as multiplicative relationships or joint feature
contributions. In this work, we propose a general theory of higher-order
feature attribution, which we develop on the foundation of Integrated Gradients
(IG). This work extends existing frameworks in the literature on explainable
AI. When using IG as the method of feature attribution, we discover natural
connections to statistics and topological signal processing. We provide several
theoretical results that establish the theory, and we validate our theory on a
few examples.

Abstract: We establish a fundamental connection between score-based diffusion models
and non-equilibrium thermodynamics by deriving performance limits based on
entropy rates. Our main theoretical contribution is a lower bound on the
negative log-likelihood of the data that relates model performance to entropy
rates of diffusion processes. We numerically validate this bound on a synthetic
dataset and investigate its tightness. By building a bridge to entropy rates -
system, intrinsic, and exchange entropy - we provide new insights into the
thermodynamic operation of these models, drawing parallels to Maxwell's demon
and implications for thermodynamic computing hardware. Our framework connects
generative modeling performance to fundamental physical principles through
stochastic thermodynamics.

Abstract: Uncertainty quantification (UQ) over graphs arises in a number of
safety-critical applications in network science. The Gaussian process (GP), as
a classical Bayesian framework for UQ, has been developed to handle
graph-structured data by devising topology-aware kernel functions. However,
such GP-based approaches are limited not only by the prohibitive computational
complexity, but also the strict modeling assumptions that might yield poor
coverage, especially with labels arriving on the fly. To effect scalability, we
devise a novel graph-aware parametric GP model by leveraging the random feature
(RF)-based kernel approximation, which is amenable to efficient recursive
Bayesian model updates. To further allow for adaptivity, an ensemble of
graph-aware RF-based scalable GPs have been leveraged, with per-GP weight
adapted to data arriving incrementally. To ensure valid coverage with
robustness to model mis-specification, we wed the GP-based set predictors with
the online conformal prediction framework, which post-processes the prediction
sets using adaptive thresholds. Experimental results the proposed method yields
improved coverage and efficient prediction sets over existing baselines by
adaptively ensembling the GP models and setting the key threshold parameters in
CP.

Abstract: This paper formally studies generation processes, including auto-regressive
next-token prediction and masked diffusion, that abstract beyond architectural
specifics. At this level of abstraction, we quantify their benefits and
limitations through measurable criteria such as computational hardness and
learnability. In particular, we demonstrate that allowing generation to proceed
beyond autoregression and current masked diffusion, with capabilities to
rewrite and length-variable edit, can bring significant theoretical and
empirical advantages, with important implications for frontier LLMs that aspire
to tackle increasingly hard problems and work universally across domains beyond
natural language, such as coding and science.

TL;DR: RGSD算法通过参考数据在语义潜空间中实现技能发现，在高维系统中同时模仿参考行为并发现语义相关的多样化行为


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 将无监督技能发现扩展到高自由度系统面临挑战，因为探索空间呈指数增长而意义技能流形有限，需要语义意义来有效指导高维空间探索

Method: RGSD首先通过对比预训练将动作嵌入单位超球面，将每个参考轨迹聚类为不同方向，使技能发现能同时模仿参考行为并发现语义相关的多样化行为

Result: 在359维观测和69维动作的SMPL人形模拟器中，RGSD学习了包括行走、奔跑、出拳、侧步等结构化技能，并发现了相关的新行为，在下游控制任务中优于基于模仿的技能获取基线

Conclusion: 轻量级参考引导的grounding为在高自由度系统中发现语义丰富和结构化的技能提供了实用路径

Abstract: Scaling unsupervised skill discovery algorithms to high-DoF agents remains
challenging. As dimensionality increases, the exploration space grows
exponentially, while the manifold of meaningful skills remains limited.
Therefore, semantic meaningfulness becomes essential to effectively guide
exploration in high-dimensional spaces. In this work, we present
Reference-Grounded Skill Discovery (RGSD), a novel algorithm that grounds skill
discovery in a semantically meaningful latent space using reference data. RGSD
first performs contrastive pretraining to embed motions on a unit hypersphere,
clustering each reference trajectory into a distinct direction. This grounding
enables skill discovery to simultaneously involve both imitation of reference
behaviors and the discovery of semantically related diverse behaviors. On a
simulated SMPL humanoid with 359-D observations and 69-D actions, RGSD learns
structured skills including walking, running, punching, and side stepping, and
also discovers related novel behaviors. In downstream control tasks, RGSD
outperforms imitation-based skill acquisition baselines. Our results suggest
that lightweight reference-guided grounding offers a practical path to
discovering semantically rich and structured skills in high-DoF systems.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文通过分析大规模语言模型训练轨迹，发现量化误差主要由学习率与其他训练超参数的复杂相互作用驱动，而非训练数据规模。研究表明通过策略性调整训练超参数可以在大规模训练中改善量化质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管后训练量化被广泛用于大语言模型的高效部署，但量化鲁棒性的内在机制仍不清楚。研究旨在准确评估训练动态与量化性能之间的关系。

Method: 对开源语言模型训练轨迹进行综合分析（最大32B参数和15T训练token），并在受控实验中训练自己的模型（最多100B token），研究训练动态干预措施。

Result: 发现一旦学习率衰减，验证损失和量化误差就会发散，这与训练数据规模基本无关。挑战了增加数据集规模会损害量化效果的假设。

Conclusion: 策略性的训练超参数干预可以在大规模训练中改善量化质量，量化误差主要由学习率与其他超参数的相互作用驱动，而非单纯的数据规模。

Abstract: While post-training quantization is widely adopted for efficient deployment
of large language models, the mechanisms underlying quantization robustness
remain unclear. We conduct a comprehensive analysis of quantization degradation
across open-source language model training trajectories up to 32B parameters
and 15T training tokens to accurately assess the relationship between training
dynamics and quantization performance. Our key finding is that quantization
errors in large-scale training runs are driven by a complex interplay between
learning rate and other training hyperparameters. Specifically, once learning
rates decay, validation loss and quantization error diverge, largely
independent of training data scale. To investigate interventions on the
training dynamics and identify specific configurations that can modulate
quantization robustness favorably, we train our own models in controlled
experiments up to 100B tokens. Our results challenge the assumption that
increasing dataset scale inherently compromises quantization effectiveness,
demonstrating instead that strategic training hyperparameter interventions can
improve quantization quality at scale.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM智能体在解决复杂多步问题时依赖外部工具，但搜索轨迹存在结构性异质性，导致标准策略梯度方法出现跨层偏差，阻碍复杂搜索策略的探索。

Method: 提出Stratified GRPO方法，核心是分层优势归一化(SAN)，根据轨迹结构特性将轨迹划分为同质层，在每层内局部计算优势值，并通过线性混合SAN与全局估计器提高实际稳定性。

Result: 在多种单跳和多跳问答基准测试中，Stratified GRPO比GRPO提升高达11.3分，获得更高的训练奖励、更好的训练稳定性和更有效的搜索策略。

Conclusion: 分层方法为LLM搜索智能体中的结构性异质性提供了原则性解决方案，证明了其在强化学习中的有效性。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents increasingly rely on external tools such as
search engines to solve complex, multi-step problems, and reinforcement
learning (RL) has become a key paradigm for training them. However, the
trajectories of search agents are structurally heterogeneous, where variations
in the number, placement, and outcomes of search calls lead to fundamentally
different answer directions and reward distributions. Standard policy gradient
methods, which use a single global baseline, suffer from what we identify and
formalize as cross-stratum bias-an "apples-to-oranges" comparison of
heterogeneous trajectories. This cross-stratum bias distorts credit assignment
and hinders exploration of complex, multi-step search strategies. To address
this, we propose Stratified GRPO, whose central component, Stratified Advantage
Normalization (SAN), partitions trajectories into homogeneous strata based on
their structural properties and computes advantages locally within each
stratum. This ensures that trajectories are evaluated only against their true
peers. Our analysis proves that SAN eliminates cross-stratum bias, yields
conditionally unbiased unit-variance estimates inside each stratum, and retains
the global unbiasedness and unit-variance properties enjoyed by standard
normalization, resulting in a more pure and scale-stable learning signal. To
improve practical stability under finite-sample regimes, we further linearly
blend SAN with the global estimator. Extensive experiments on diverse
single-hop and multi-hop question-answering benchmarks demonstrate that
Stratified GRPO consistently and substantially outperforms GRPO by up to 11.3
points, achieving higher training rewards, greater training stability, and more
effective search policies. These results establish stratification as a
principled remedy for structural heterogeneity in RL for LLM search agents.
