Conclusion: 所提出的方法有效解决了模拟内存计算系统的可靠性和编译效率问题，为大规模部署提供了可行方案

Abstract: This paper addresses two critical challenges in analog In-Memory Computing
(IMC) systems that limit their scalability and deployability: the computational
unreliability caused by stuck-at faults (SAFs) and the high compilation
overhead of existing fault-mitigation algorithms, namely Fault-Free (FF). To
overcome these limitations, we first propose a novel multi-bit weight
representation technique, termed row-column hybrid grouping, which generalizes
conventional column grouping by introducing redundancy across both rows and
columns. This structural redundancy enhances fault tolerance and can be
effectively combined with existing fault-mitigation solutions. Second, we
design a compiler pipeline that reformulates the fault-aware weight
decomposition problem as an Integer Linear Programming (ILP) task, enabling
fast and scalable compilation through off-the-shelf solvers. Further
acceleration is achieved through theoretical insights that identify fault
patterns amenable to trivial solutions, significantly reducing computation.
Experimental results on convolutional networks and small language models
demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, achieving up to 8%p improvement
in accuracy, 150x faster compilation, and 2x energy efficiency gain compared to
existing baselines.

### [5] [Money in Motion: Micro-Velocity and Usage of Ethereums Liquid Staking Tokens](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15391)
*Benjamin Kraner,Luca Pennella,Nicolò Vallarano,Claudio J. Tessone*

Main category: cs.ET

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一个微速度分析框架，用于研究Lido流动性质押代币stETH和wstETH的链上流通情况，揭示了高周转率、机构主导以及向wstETH转移的用户行为趋势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 流动性质押代币(LSTs)在DeFi中日益重要，但其微观层面的货币动态尚未得到充分探索，需要系统性的实证分析。

Method: 通过重建完整的转账和份额记账历史，计算地址级别的速度指标，并将其分解为行为组件，同时开发开源数据管道索引事件日志和历史合约状态。

Result: 发现两种代币都保持高周转率，活动高度集中（少数大地址主导大部分交易），用户行为逐渐向非复利版本的wstETH转移，这与DeFi可组合性趋势一致。

Conclusion: 该研究提供了首个大规模流动性质押代币流通的实证特征描述，为监控质押资产流动提供了可扩展模板，并向研究社区开放了新的数据资源。

Abstract: We introduce a micro-velocity framework for analysing the on-chain
circulation of Lidos liquid-staking tokens, stETH, and its wrapped ERC-20 form,
wstETH. By reconstructing full transfer and share-based accounting histories,
we compute address-level velocities and decompose them into behavioural
components. Despite their growing importance, the micro-level monetary dynamics
of LSTs remain largely unexplored. Our data reveal persistently high velocity
for both tokens, reflecting intensive reuse within DeFi. Yet activity is highly
concentrated: a small cohort of large addresses, likely institutional accounts,
are responsible for most turnover, while the rest of the users remain largely
passive. We also observe a gradual transition in user behavior, characterized
by a shift toward wstETH, the non-rebasing variant of stETH. This shift appears
to align with DeFi composability trends, as wstETH is more frequently deployed
across protocols such as AAVE, Spark, Balancer, and SkyMoney.
  To make the study fully reproducible, we release (i) an open-source pipeline
that indexes event logs and historical contract state, and (ii) two public
datasets containing every Transfer and TransferShares record for stETH and
wstETH through 2024-11-08. This is the first large-scale empirical
characterisation of liquid-staking token circulation. Our approach offers a
scalable template for monitoring staking asset flows and provides new,
open-access resources to the research community.

TL;DR: 提出分布式共享分层存储量子模拟器(DSLSQS)，通过分布式架构和去TCP/IP网络技术消除东西向数据流，解决量子模拟器的单节点瓶颈问题，性能提升350%


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 量子模拟器的高频遍历特性对IT系统提出前所未有的需求，现有分布式技术无法满足，导致量子模拟器出现单节点瓶颈

Method: 采用多计算节点直接共享数据存储的分布式架构，结合De-TCP/IP网络技术消除东西向数据流，并采用分层存储技术减少高性能内存使用

Result: 27量子位模拟实验验证了分层存储的成功实现，性能相比现有分布式技术提升超过350%

Conclusion: DSLSQS显著提升了模拟效率，为量子计算的实际部署提供了关键见解，并为分布式量子模拟集群开发提供了有效框架

Abstract: Quantum simulators are essential tools for developing and testing quantum
algorithms. However, the high-frequency traversal characteristic of quantum
simulators represents an unprecedented demand in the history of IT, and
existing distributed technologies is unable to meet this requirement, resulting
in a single-node bottleneck of quantum simulator. To overcome this limitation,
this paper introduces a novel Distributed Shared Layered Storage Quantum
Simulator (DSLSQS). By leveraging an innovative distributed architecture in
which multiple computational nodes share data storage directly, together with
De-TCP/IP networking technology, DSLSQS effectively eliminates East-West data
flow in distributed systems. This approach mitigates the bottleneck of
distributed quantum simulation clusters and enhances the scalability. Moreover,
the system employs layered storage technology, which reduces usage of expensive
high-performance memory and substantially lowers simulation costs. Furthermore,
this paper systematically analyzes the performance and cost constraints of
distributed quantum simulator cluster, identifying distributed networking as
the primary performance bottleneck and highlighting that minimizing storage
costs is crucial to reducing the total cost. Finally, experimental evaluations
with a 27-qubit simulation confirm the successful implementation of layered
storage within the quantum simulator. DSLSQS significantly enhances simulation
efficiency, yielding a performance improvement of over 350% compared to
existing distributed technologies. These results underscore the superior
performance and scalability of the proposed architecture in managing complex
quantum computing tasks. This paper provides crucial insights for the practical
deployment of quantum computing and presents an effective framework for the
development of distributed quantum simulation clusters.

TL;DR: 量子状态模拟优化框架QVecOpt，通过四种策略将单元门遍历复杂度从O(2^n)降至O(1)，在16-29位量子模拟中效率提升10倍


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大规模量子状态在经典计算平台上模拟的挑战，包括内存限制、频繁磁盘I/O咉高计算复杂度

Method: 提出QVecOpt优化框架，集成四种策略：振幅配对机制、缓存优化、块存储优化和并行优化，通过位异或定位相关振幅对降低遍历复杂度

Result: 单元门遍历次数从2^n降至1次，计算和I/O复杂度从O(2^n)降至O(2^n/C)和O(2^n/B)，在16-29位量子模拟中效率提升近10倍

Conclusion: 该方法突破了现有工具的内存瓶颈，为经典计算平台上的大规模量子计算模拟提供了高效、可扩展的解决方案，具有重要的学术和实践价值

Abstract: In response to the challenges in large-scale quantum state simulation on
classical computing platforms, including memory limits, frequent disk I/O, and
high computational complexity, this study builds upon a previously proposed
hierarchical storage-based quantum simulation system and introduces an
optimization framework, the Quantum Vector Optimization Framework (QVecOpt).
QVecOpt integrates four strategies: amplitude pairing, cache optimization,
block storage optimization, and parallel optimization. These collectively
enhance state vector storage and computational scheduling. The amplitude
pairing mechanism locates relevant amplitude pairs via bitwise XOR, reducing
traversal complexity of single-qubit gates from $O(2^n)$ to $O(1)$. Cache
optimization pre-allocates buffers and loads only required data, cutting disk
I/O. Block storage optimization partitions the state vector for on-demand
loading and local updates, reducing redundant access. Parallel optimization
distributes the state vector across nodes for collaborative computation,
achieving near-linear speedup. Complexity analysis shows that, compared with
hierarchical storage simulation, the method reduces state vector traversals for
single-qubit gates from $2^n$ to 1, removing the main bottleneck. It also
lowers computational and I/O complexity from $O(2^n)$ to $O(2^n/C)$ and
$O(2^n/B)$. In simulations of 16-29 qubits, efficiency improves nearly tenfold,
breaking the memory bottleneck of existing tools and enabling high-bit quantum
circuit simulations beyond traditional methods. This work provides an
efficient, scalable solution for classical simulation of large-scale quantum
computation with significant academic and practical value.

Motivation: 研究能源效率的阵容编程协议对于电弊存器设备的实际应用至关重要，这是当前学术界和产业界热点研究议题。

Method: 提出了一种独特但通用的控制范式，应用于Kvatinsky的电压阈值适配电弊存器模型和Miranda与Sune的动态平衡模型进行分析。

Result: 发现最优协议可能是单个方波电压脉冲，或者更复杂的连续模拟信号，具体取决于设备的本质物理属性、编程时间和电压约束条件。

Conclusion: 这项研究为电弊存器设备的能源效率编程提供了重要的理论基础和实践指南，有助于解决设备物理层面的电压-时间困境问题。

Abstract: In many cases, the behavior of physical memristive devices can be relatively
well captured by using a single internal state variable. This study
investigates the low-power control of first-order memristive devices to derive
the most energy-efficient protocols for programming their resistances. A unique
yet general approach to optimizing the switching transitions in devices of this
kind is introduced. For pedagogical purposes, without loss of generality, the
proposed control paradigm is applied to a couple of differential algebraic
equation sets for voltage-controlled devices, specifically Kvatinsky's Voltage
ThrEshold Adaptive Memristor mathematical description and Miranda's and Sune's
dynamic balance model. It is demonstrated that, depending upon intrinsic
physical properties of the device, captured in the model formulas and parameter
setting, and upon constraints on programming time and voltages, the optimal
protocol for either of the two switching scenarios may require the application
of a single square voltage pulse of height set to a certain level within the
admissible range across a fraction or entire given programming time interval,
or of some more involved voltage stimulus of unique polarity, including
analogue continuous waveforms that can be approximated by trains of square
voltage pulses of different heights, over the entire programming time interval.
The practical implications of these research findings are significant, as the
development of energy-efficient protocols to program memristive devices,
resolving the so-called voltage-time dilemma in the device physics community,
is a subject under intensive and extensive studies across the academic
community and industry.

Abstract: Realisation of significant advances in capabilities of sensors, computing,
timing, and communication enabled by quantum technologies is dependent on
engineering highly complex systems that integrate quantum devices into existing
classical infrastructure. A systems engineering approach is considered to
address the growing need for quantum-secure telecommunications that overcome
the threat to encryption caused by maturing quantum computation. This work
explores a range of existing and future quantum communication networks,
specifically quantum key distribution network proposals, to model and
demonstrate the evolution of quantum key distribution network architectures.
Leveraging Orthogonal Variability Modelling and Systems Modelling Language as
candidate modelling languages, the study creates traceable artefacts to promote
modular architectures that are reusable for future studies. We propose a
variability-driven framework for managing fast-evolving network architectures
with respect to increasing stakeholder expectations. The result contributes to
the systematic development of viable quantum key distribution networks and
supports the investigation of similar integration challenges relevant to the
broader context of quantum systems engineering.

Abstract: Modern distributed data processing systems face significant challenges in
balancing system performance with code maintainability and developer
productivity, particularly when integrating machine learning capabilities at
scale. In large collaborative environments, these challenges are amplified by
high communication overhead between teams and the complexity of coordinating
development across multiple groups. This paper presents a novel "Declarative
Data Pipeline" architecture that addresses these challenges while processing
billions of records with high accuracy and efficiency. Our architecture
introduces a modular framework that seamlessly integrates machine learning
capabilities within Apache Spark by combining logical computation units that we
refer as Pipes, departing from traditional microservice-based approaches. By
establishing clear component boundaries and standardized interfaces, we achieve
both modularity and system optimization without sacrificing maintainability.
The enterprise case study demonstrate substantial improvements in multiple
dimensions: development efficiency improved by 50%,
collaboration/troubleshooting efforts compressed from weeks to days,
performance improved by 500x in scalability and by 10x in throughput. The
academic experiment also proves at least 5.7x faster in throughput with 99% CPU
utilization than non-framework implementations. This paper details the
architectural decisions, implementation strategies, and performance
optimizations that enable these improvements, providing insights for building
scalable, maintainable data processing systems that effectively balance system
performance with development velocity.

Abstract: Mixed-precision inference techniques reduce the memory and computational
demands of Large Language Models (LLMs) by applying hybrid precision formats to
model weights, activations, and KV caches. This work introduces mixed-precision
LLM inference techniques that encompass (i) systematic memory and compute
optimization across hierarchical storage and tensor core architectures, and
(ii) comprehensive end-to-end mixed-precision optimization across diverse
precision formats and hardware configurations. Our approach features two novel
mixed-precision pipelines designed for optimal hardware utilization: a General
Matrix Multiply (GEMM) pipeline that optimizes matrix operations through
offline weight packing and online acceleration, and an attention pipeline that
enables efficient attention computation with arbitrary Query, Key, and Value
precision combinations. The key implementation of the pipelines includes (i)
hardware-aware weight packing for automatic format optimization, (ii) adaptive
head alignment for efficient attention computation, (iii) instruction-level
parallelism for memory hierarchy exploitation, and (iv) KV memory loading
pipeline for enhanced inference efficiency. We conduct comprehensive
evaluations across 16 popular LLMs and 4 representative GPU architectures.
Results demonstrate that our approach achieves up to 61% lower serving latency
(30% on average) and up to 156% higher throughput (58% on average) in
mixed-precision workloads compared to existing mixed-precision frameworks,
establishing consistent performance improvements across all tested
configurations and hardware types. This work is integrated into TurboMind, a

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: Databelt是一个面向3D计算连续体动态环境的无服务器工作流状态管理框架，通过SLO感知状态传播和函数状态融合机制，显著降低状态访问延迟和网络开销


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统无服务器函数依赖远程存储服务管理状态，在动态的3D计算连续体环境中会导致高延迟和网络通信开销。卫星移动导致网络拓扑频繁变化，函数需要多次跳转访问云服务，造成高延迟状态访问和不必要的数据传输

Method: 1. SLO感知状态传播机制：主动将函数状态卸载到最合适的节点，使函数执行时数据已在执行节点或附近
2. 函数状态融合机制：为共享同一无服务器运行时的函数抽象状态管理，将函数状态作为组检索，减少冗余网络和存储操作

Result: 1. 工作流执行时间减少高达66%
2. 吞吐量提高50%
3. 存储操作延迟降低高达20%
4. 减少同一运行时内函数的重复存储请求

Conclusion: Databelt通过在动态网络环境中智能管理函数状态，显著提升了无服务器工作流的执行效率和性能，特别适用于3D计算连续体等高度动态的网络环境

Abstract: Typically, serverless functions rely on remote storage services for managing
state, which can result in increased latency and network communication
overhead. In a dynamic environment such as the 3D (Edge-Cloud-Space) Compute
Continuum, serverless functions face additional challenges due to frequent
changes in network topology. As satellites move in and out of the range of
ground stations, functions must make multiple hops to access cloud services,
leading to high-latency state access and unnecessary data transfers. In this
paper, we present Databelt, a state management framework for serverless
workflows designed for the dynamic environment of the 3D Compute Continuum.
Databelt introduces an SLO-aware state propagation mechanism that enables the
function state to move continuously in orbit. Databelt proactively offloads
function states to the most suitable node, such that when functions execute,
the data is already present on the execution node or nearby, thus minimizing
state access latency and reducing the number of network hops. Additionally,
Databelt introduces a function state fusion mechanism that abstracts state
management for functions sharing the same serverless runtime. When functions
are fused, Databelt seamlessly retrieves their state as a group, reducing
redundant network and storage operations and improving overall workflow
efficiency. Our experimental results show that Databelt reduces workflow
execution time by up to 66% and increases throughput by 50% compared to the
baselines. Furthermore, our results show that Databelt function state fusion
reduces storage operations latency by up to 20%, by reducing repetitive storage
requests for functions within the same runtime, ensuring efficient execution of
serverless workflows in highly dynamic network environments such as the 3D
Continuum.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究表明舞蹈问题需要严格的约束条件（如模式重复、周期性、对称性等），本文旨在探索在LUMI模型和顺序调度器下是否能够移除这些必要约束，实现更通用的舞蹈编排能力。

Method: 利用LUMI模型中机器人带有恒定大小调色板的灯光特性，在顺序调度器下实现分布式计数器机制，即使是非刚性移动也能确保编舞的空间均匀性。

Result: 成功证明了在LUMI模型下可以解决通用舞蹈问题，机器人能够从任何初始配置执行任意模式序列，但编排长度受n个机器人的颜色组合数限制。

Conclusion: LUMI模型配合顺序调度器能够突破传统舞蹈问题的约束限制，实现更灵活的通用舞蹈编排，为自主移动机器人的协同运动控制提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: The Dancing problem requires a swarm of $n$ autonomous mobile robots to form
a sequence of patterns, aka perform a choreography. Existing work has proven
that some crucial restrictions on choreographies and initial configurations
(e.g., on repetitions of patterns, periodicity, symmetries,
contractions/expansions) must hold so that the Dancing problem can be solved
under certain robot models. Here, we prove that these necessary constraints can
be dropped by considering the LUMI model (i.e., where robots are endowed with a
light whose color can be chosen from a constant-size palette) under the quite
unexplored sequential scheduler. We formalize the class of Universal Dancing
problems which require a swarm of $n$ robots starting from any initial
configuration to perform a (periodic or finite) sequence of arbitrary patterns,
only provided that each pattern consists of $n$ vertices (including
multiplicities). However, we prove that, to be solvable under LUMI, the length
of the feasible choreographies is bounded by the compositions of $n$ into the
number of colors available to the robots. We provide an algorithm solving the
Universal Dancing problem by exploiting the peculiar capability of sequential
robots to implement a distributed counter mechanism. Even assuming non-rigid
movements, our algorithm ensures spatial homogeneity of the performed
choreography.

Motivation: 推广k-set协议在任意有向通信网络中的下界结果，统一和扩展先前针对完整网络和特定网络拓扑的已知下界

Method: 使用拓扑证明方法，基于shellable carrier maps序列，在前t/k轮使用每轮崩溃k个进程的carrier maps，后续轮次使用新型carrier map保持高连通性，采用Sperner引理风格论证

Result: 建立了任意有向网络中k-set协议的同步下界，证明了在特定轮数内k-set协议仍然不可能，提供了基于通信图半径的额外协议开销表达式

Conclusion: 该方法成功推广了完整网络的结果到任意有向网络，提供了简单有效的下界证明，并展示了可以使用基于Kuhn三角剖分的更小输入复形

Abstract: We develop a new lower bound for k-set agreement in synchronous
message-passing systems connected by an arbitrary directed communication
network, where up to t processes may crash. Our result thus generalizes the
t/k+1 lower bound for complete networks in the t-resilient model by Chaudhuri,
Herlihy, Lynch, and Tuttle [JACM'00]. Moreover, it generalizes two lower bounds
for oblivious algorithms in synchronous systems connected by an arbitrary
undirected communication network known to the processes, namely, the domination
number-based lower bound by Castaneda, Fraigniaud, Paz, Rajsbaum, Roy, and
Travers [TCS'21] for failure-free processes, and the radius-based lower bound
in the t-resilient model by Fraigniaud, Nguyen, and Paz [STACS'24].
  Our topological proof non-trivially generalizes and extends the
connectivity-based approach for the complete network, as presented in the book
by Herlihy, Kozlov, and Rajsbaum (2013). It is based on a sequence of shellable
carrier maps that, starting from a shellable input complex, determine the
evolution of the protocol complex: During the first t/k rounds, carrier maps
that crash exactly k processes per round are used, ensuring high connectivity
of their images. A Sperner's lemma style argument is used to prove that k-set
agreement is still impossible by that round. From round t/k+1 up to our lower
bound, we employ a novel carrier map that maintains high connectivity. Our
proof also provides a strikingly simple lower bound for k-set agreement in
synchronous systems with an arbitrary communication network with initial
crashes. We express the resulting additional agreement overhead via an
appropriately defined radius of the communication graphs. Finally, we prove
that the usual input pseudosphere complex for k-set agreement can be replaced
by an exponentially smaller input complex based on Kuhn triangulations, which
we prove to be also shellable.

*Haoran Zhang,Zihao Zhang,Shuai Mu,Sebastian Angel,Vincent Liu*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: CausalMesh是一个新颖的因果一致性缓存系统，专门为服务器无状态工作流设计，支持客户端在多服务器间漫游时的无协调、无中止读写操作和读事务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在服务器无状态环境中，工作流中的函数可能被调度到不同节点，这些节点拥有不同的缓存，这会导致非直观的异常。现有缓存方案无法很好地处理客户端在多服务器间漫游的情况。

Method: 提出了CausalMesh系统，采用因果一致性缓存协议，支持无协调和无中止的读写操作。系统在Dafny中进行了形式化验证。

Result: 实验评估显示，CausalMesh相比现有方案具有更低的延迟和更高的吞吐量。

Conclusion: CausalMesh是第一个支持客户端在多服务器间漫游时无协调、无中止操作的缓存系统，为服务器无状态工作流提供了有效的因果一致性缓存解决方案。

Abstract: Stateful serverless workflows consist of multiple serverless functions that
access state on a remote database. Developers sometimes add a cache layer
between the serverless runtime and the database to improve I/O latency.
However, in a serverless environment, functions in the same workflow may be
scheduled to different nodes with different caches, which can cause
non-intuitive anomalies. This paper presents CausalMesh, a novel approach to
causally consistent caching in environments where a computation may migrate
from one machine to another, such as in serverless computing. CausalMesh is the
first cache system that supports coordination-free and abort-free read/write
operations and read transactions when clients roam among multiple servers.
CausalMesh also supports read-write transactional causal consistency in the
presence of client roaming, but at the cost of abort-freedom.
  We have formally verified CausalMesh's protocol in Dafny, and our
experimental evaluation shows that CausalMesh has lower latency and higher
throughput than existing proposals

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种分层安全强化学习框架，将道德考量与标准驾驶目标结合，通过伦理风险成本和动态经验回放机制，在真实交通场景中实现优于基线方法的伦理决策性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动驾驶车辆需要嵌入强大的伦理推理能力，以确保在常规和紧急操作中做出符合道德规范的决策，这是实现广泛采用的关键。

Method: 分层安全强化学习框架：决策层使用包含碰撞概率和伤害严重性的复合伦理风险成本训练Safe RL智能体；执行层采用多项式路径规划和PID+Stanley控制器实现平滑轨迹；动态优先经验回放机制强化高风险事件学习。

Result: 在包含多样化车辆、骑行者和行人的真实交通数据集上验证，该方法在降低伦理风险和保持驾驶性能方面优于基线方法。

Conclusion: 这是首个通过安全强化学习在真实场景中研究自动驾驶伦理决策的工作，结合形式控制理论和数据驱动学习，为复杂人车混合交通环境中的伦理问责自治提供了可行路径。

Abstract: Autonomous vehicles hold great promise for reducing traffic fatalities and
improving transportation efficiency, yet their widespread adoption hinges on
embedding robust ethical reasoning into routine and emergency maneuvers. Here,
we present a hierarchical Safe Reinforcement Learning (Safe RL) framework that
explicitly integrates moral considerations with standard driving objectives. At
the decision level, a Safe RL agent is trained using a composite ethical risk
cost, combining collision probability and harm severity, to generate high-level
motion targets. A dynamic Prioritized Experience Replay mechanism amplifies
learning from rare but critical, high-risk events. At the execution level,
polynomial path planning coupled with Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID)
and Stanley controllers translates these targets into smooth, feasible
trajectories, ensuring both accuracy and comfort. We train and validate our
approach on rich, real-world traffic datasets encompassing diverse vehicles,
cyclists, and pedestrians, and demonstrate that it outperforms baseline methods
in reducing ethical risk and maintaining driving performance. To our knowledge,
this is the first study of ethical decision-making for autonomous vehicles via
Safe RL in real-world scenarios. Our results highlight the potential of
combining formal control theory and data-driven learning to advance ethically
accountable autonomy in complex, human-mixed traffic environments.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了个性化身肺癌风险预测系统，通过FAISS相似性搜索和LLM推理动态选择最适合每个患者的预测模型，解决了不同症群中模型性能差异的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于不同患者群体和临床环境存在显著差异，没有单一模型能在所有症群中都表现最佳，因此需要个性化的风险预测方案。

Method: 采用两阶段流水线：首先使用FAISS相似性搜索在9个多样化真实世界症群中识别最相关的患者群体，然后使用LLM根据检索到的症群和其相关性能指标推荐最优预测算法，包括经典线性模型、时间敏感模型和多模态计算机视觉方法。

Result: 该两阶段组合方法能够实现动态的、基于症群识别的个性化风险预测，为真实世界身肺癌筛查提供了个体化风险评估的实用途径。

Conclusion: 这种结合FAISS检索和LLM推理的两阶段组合方法支持在多样化临床人群中进行灵活的、症群驱动的模型选择，是向个体化风险评估实践的重要进展。

Abstract: Accurate lung cancer risk prediction remains challenging due to substantial
variability across patient populations and clinical settings -- no single model
performs best for all cohorts. To address this, we propose a personalized lung
cancer risk prediction agent that dynamically selects the most appropriate
model for each patient by combining cohort-specific knowledge with modern
retrieval and reasoning techniques. Given a patient's CT scan and structured
metadata -- including demographic, clinical, and nodule-level features -- the
agent first performs cohort retrieval using FAISS-based similarity search
across nine diverse real-world cohorts to identify the most relevant patient
population from a multi-institutional database. Second, a Large Language Model
(LLM) is prompted with the retrieved cohort and its associated performance
metrics to recommend the optimal prediction algorithm from a pool of eight
representative models, including classical linear risk models (e.g., Mayo,
Brock), temporally-aware models (e.g., TDVIT, DLSTM), and multi-modal computer
vision-based approaches (e.g., Liao, Sybil, DLS, DLI). This two-stage agent
pipeline -- retrieval via FAISS and reasoning via LLM -- enables dynamic,
cohort-aware risk prediction personalized to each patient's profile. Building
on this architecture, the agent supports flexible and cohort-driven model
selection across diverse clinical populations, offering a practical path toward
individualized risk assessment in real-world lung cancer screening.

Abstract: Recent advances in quantum computing and machine learning have given rise to
quantum machine learning (QML), with growing interest in learning from
sequential data. Quantum recurrent models like QLSTM are promising for
time-series prediction, NLP, and reinforcement learning. However, designing
effective variational quantum circuits (VQCs) remains challenging and often
task-specific. To address this, we propose DiffQAS-QLSTM, an end-to-end
differentiable framework that optimizes both VQC parameters and architecture
selection during training. Our results show that DiffQAS-QLSTM consistently
outperforms handcrafted baselines, achieving lower loss across diverse test
settings. This approach opens the door to scalable and adaptive quantum
sequence learning.

Abstract: This study addresses the challenges of symptom evolution complexity and
insufficient temporal dependency modeling in Parkinson's disease progression
prediction. It proposes a unified prediction framework that integrates
structural perception and temporal modeling. The method leverages graph neural
networks to model the structural relationships among multimodal clinical
symptoms and introduces graph-based representations to capture semantic
dependencies between symptoms. It also incorporates a Transformer architecture
to model dynamic temporal features during disease progression. To fuse
structural and temporal information, a structure-aware gating mechanism is
designed to dynamically adjust the fusion weights between structural encodings
and temporal features, enhancing the model's ability to identify key
progression stages. To improve classification accuracy and stability, the
framework includes a multi-component modeling pipeline, consisting of a graph
construction module, a temporal encoding module, and a prediction output layer.
The model is evaluated on real-world longitudinal Parkinson's disease data. The
experiments involve comparisons with mainstream models, sensitivity analysis of
hyperparameters, and graph connection density control. Results show that the
proposed method outperforms existing approaches in AUC, RMSE, and IPW-F1
metrics. It effectively distinguishes progression stages and improves the
model's ability to capture personalized symptom trajectories. The overall
framework demonstrates strong generalization and structural scalability,
providing reliable support for intelligent modeling of chronic progressive
diseases such as Parkinson's disease.

Abstract: This paper studies an input-driven one-state differential equation model
initially developed for an experimentally demonstrated dynamic molecular switch
that switches like synapses in the brain do. The linear-in-the-state and
nonlinear-in-the-input model is exactly solvable, and it is shown that it also
possesses mathematical properties of convergence and fading memory that enable
stable processing of time-varying inputs by nonlinear dynamical systems. Thus,
the model exhibits the co-existence of biologically-inspired behavior and
desirable mathematical properties for stable learning on sequential data. The
results give theoretical support for the use of the dynamic molecular switches
as computational units in deep cascaded/layered feedforward and recurrent
architectures as well as other more general structures for neuromorphic
computing. They could also inspire more general exactly solvable models that
can be fitted to emulate arbitrary physical devices which can mimic
brain-inspired behaviour and perform stable computation on input signals.

Motivation: 现有NAS模型在文本分类中缺乏混合层次结构，搜索空间过大且冗余，导致加强学习模型无法有效遍历搜索空间

Method: 提出HHNAS-AM方法，使用基于领域特定线索的架构模板来组织搜索空间，采用Q-learning动态适应突变策略，实现全概率性的搜索空间探索

Conclusion: HHNAS-AM通过层次结构和适应性突变策略，有效解决了NAS在文本分类中的搜索空间冗余问题，显著提升了架构搜索的效率和性能

Abstract: Neural Architecture Search (NAS) has garnered significant research interest
due to its capability to discover architectures superior to manually designed
ones. Learning text representation is crucial for text classification and other
language-related tasks. The NAS model used in text classification does not have
a Hybrid hierarchical structure, and there is no restriction on the
architecture structure, due to which the search space becomes very large and
mostly redundant, so the existing RL models are not able to navigate the search
space effectively. Also, doing a flat architecture search leads to an
unorganised search space, which is difficult to traverse. For this purpose, we
propose HHNAS-AM (Hierarchical Hybrid Neural Architecture Search with Adaptive
Mutation Policies), a novel approach that efficiently explores diverse
architectural configurations. We introduce a few architectural templates to
search on which organise the search spaces, where search spaces are designed on
the basis of domain-specific cues. Our method employs mutation strategies that
dynamically adapt based on performance feedback from previous iterations using
Q-learning, enabling a more effective and accelerated traversal of the search
space. The proposed model is fully probabilistic, enabling effective
exploration of the search space. We evaluate our approach on the database id
(db_id) prediction task, where it consistently discovers high-performing
architectures across multiple experiments. On the Spider dataset, our method
achieves an 8% improvement in test accuracy over existing baselines.

Motivation: DPO虽然简单稳定但容易过拟合和崩溃，需要更鲁棒的偏好优化算法。

Method: 引入梯度解耦（用绝对差损失替代log-sigmoid）、偏移约束加正则化保持响应质量、可控拒绝抑制（梯度分离和可调系数）。

Result: 在通用文本任务、数学任务和文本转语音任务上均表现出性能提升。

Conclusion: LPO提供了一个鲁棒且可调的偏好对齐范式，已开源代码、模型和训练数据。

Abstract: DPO (Direct Preference Optimization) has become a widely used offline
preference optimization algorithm due to its simplicity and training stability.
However, DPO is prone to overfitting and collapse. To address these challenges,
we propose Linear Preference Optimization (LPO), a novel alignment framework
featuring three key innovations. First, we introduce gradient decoupling by
replacing the log-sigmoid function with an absolute difference loss, thereby
isolating the optimization dynamics. Second, we improve stability through an
offset constraint combined with a positive regularization term to preserve the
chosen response quality. Third, we implement controllable rejection suppression
using gradient separation with straightforward estimation and a tunable
coefficient that linearly regulates the descent of the rejection probability.
Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that LPO consistently improves
performance on various tasks, including general text tasks, math tasks, and
text-to-speech (TTS) tasks. These results establish LPO as a robust and tunable
paradigm for preference alignment, and we release the source code, models, and
training data publicly.

Conclusion: LFM4Ads通过全表示迁移和多粒度机制有效解决了现有方法的局限性，在工业级广告推荐中实现了显著的业务效果提升

Abstract: Online advertising relies on accurate recommendation models, with recent
advances using pre-trained large-scale foundation models (LFMs) to capture
users' general interests across multiple scenarios and tasks. However, existing
methods have critical limitations: they extract and transfer only user
representations (URs), ignoring valuable item representations (IRs) and
user-item cross representations (CRs); and they simply use a UR as a feature in
downstream applications, which fails to bridge upstream-downstream gaps and
overlooks more transfer granularities. In this paper, we propose LFM4Ads, an
All-Representation Multi-Granularity transfer framework for ads recommendation.
It first comprehensively transfers URs, IRs, and CRs, i.e., all available
representations in the pre-trained foundation model. To effectively utilize the
CRs, it identifies the optimal extraction layer and aggregates them into
transferable coarse-grained forms. Furthermore, we enhance the transferability
via multi-granularity mechanisms: non-linear adapters for feature-level
transfer, an Isomorphic Interaction Module for module-level transfer, and
Standalone Retrieval for model-level transfer. LFM4Ads has been successfully
deployed in Tencent's industrial-scale advertising platform, processing tens of
billions of daily samples while maintaining terabyte-scale model parameters
with billions of sparse embedding keys across approximately two thousand
features. Since its production deployment in Q4 2024, LFM4Ads has achieved 10+
successful production launches across various advertising scenarios, including
primary ones like Weixin Moments and Channels. These launches achieve an
overall GMV lift of 2.45% across the entire platform, translating to estimated
annual revenue increases in the hundreds of millions of dollars.

Conclusion: 该方法实现了高保真重建，支持增强的对流诊断、实时数据同化和改进的长期气候再分析

Abstract: Accurate atmospheric profiles from remote sensing instruments such as Doppler
Lidar, Radar, and radiometers are frequently corrupted by low-SNR (Signal to
Noise Ratio) gates, range folding, and spurious discontinuities. Traditional
gap filling blurs fine-scale structures, whereas deep models lack confidence
estimates. We present CuMoLoS-MAE, a Curriculum-Guided Monte Carlo Stochastic
Ensemble Masked Autoencoder designed to (i) restore fine-scale features such as
updraft and downdraft cores, shear lines, and small vortices, (ii) learn a
data-driven prior over atmospheric fields, and (iii) quantify pixel-wise
uncertainty. During training, CuMoLoS-MAE employs a mask-ratio curriculum that
forces a ViT decoder to reconstruct from progressively sparser context. At
inference, we approximate the posterior predictive by Monte Carlo over random
mask realisations, evaluating the MAE multiple times and aggregating the
outputs to obtain the posterior predictive mean reconstruction together with a
finely resolved per-pixel uncertainty map. Together with high-fidelity
reconstruction, this novel deep learning-based workflow enables enhanced
convection diagnostics, supports real-time data assimilation, and improves
long-term climate reanalysis.

Conclusion: 该系统通过创新的分析方法和搜索策略，有效解决了大型机器学习模型分布式分区的复杂性问题，实现了更好的性能和自动化程度

Abstract: Partitioning large machine learning models across distributed accelerator
systems is a complex process, requiring a series of interdependent decisions
that are further complicated by internal sharding ambiguities. Consequently,
existing auto-partitioners often suffer from out-of-memory errors or are
prohibitively slow when exploring the exponentially large space of possible
partitionings. To mitigate this, they artificially restrict the search space,
but this approach frequently yields infeasible solutions that violate device
memory constraints or lead to sub-optimal performance.
  We propose a system that combines a novel static compiler analysis with a
Monte Carlo Tree Search. Our analysis constructs an efficient decision space by
identifying (i) tensor dimensions requiring identical sharding, and (ii)
partitioning "conflicts" that require resolution.
  Our system significantly outperforms state-of-the-art industrial methods
across diverse hardware platforms and model architectures, discovering
previously unknown, superior solutions, and the process is fully automated even
for complex and large models.

*Anastasis Kratsios,Ariel Neufeld,Philipp Schmocker*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文针对神经算子(NOs)理论与实践的差距，提出了生成平衡算子(GEOs)方法，通过有限维深度平衡层解决可分离希尔伯特空间中的凸优化问题族，证明了在输入损失函数位于合适紧集时，GEO能以对数增长的参数复杂度实现任意精度的近似。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 神经算子的理论分析表明需要大量参数才能解决算子学习问题，这与实验证据相矛盾。本文旨在弥合这一差距，特别针对凸优化问题族，提出更实用的解决方案。

Method: 使用生成平衡算子(GEOs)和有限维深度平衡层，处理可分离希尔伯特空间中的凸优化问题。输入是光滑凸损失函数，输出是对应的优化问题近似解。

Result: 理论证明当输入损失位于合适的无限维紧集时，GEO能以秩、深度和宽度仅按近似误差倒数的对数增长的复杂度，实现任意精度的均匀近似。在非线性PDE、随机最优控制和数学金融对冲问题三个应用中验证了理论结果和可训练性。

Conclusion: GEOs成功弥合了神经算子理论与实践的差距，为无限维凸优化问题提供了高效且理论保证的近似解决方案，参数复杂度仅为对数增长，具有重要的理论和应用价值。

Abstract: Neural operators (NOs) are a class of deep learning models designed to
simultaneously solve infinitely many related problems by casting them into an
infinite-dimensional space, whereon these NOs operate. A significant gap
remains between theory and practice: worst-case parameter bounds from universal
approximation theorems suggest that NOs may require an unrealistically large
number of parameters to solve most operator learning problems, which stands in
direct opposition to a slew of experimental evidence. This paper closes that
gap for a specific class of {NOs}, generative {equilibrium operators} (GEOs),
using (realistic) finite-dimensional deep equilibrium layers, when solving
families of convex optimization problems over a separable Hilbert space $X$.
Here, the inputs are smooth, convex loss functions on $X$, and outputs are the
associated (approximate) solutions to the optimization problem defined by each
input loss.
  We show that when the input losses lie in suitable infinite-dimensional
compact sets, our GEO can uniformly approximate the corresponding solutions to
arbitrary precision, with rank, depth, and width growing only logarithmically
in the reciprocal of the approximation error. We then validate both our
theoretical results and the trainability of GEOs on three applications: (1)
nonlinear PDEs, (2) stochastic optimal control problems, and (3) hedging
problems in mathematical finance under liquidity constraints.

TL;DR: SEAL是一种可解释的图神经网络，通过将分子分解为化学相关片段并估计其对输出的因果影响，提供更直观可信的分子属性预测解释。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 图神经网络在分子属性预测中表现出色，但其黑盒特性降低了可解释性，限制了在药物发现等关键应用中的可信度。现有解释技术往往无法可靠量化单个原子或子结构的贡献。

Method: SEAL将输入图分解为化学相关片段，通过显式减少片段间消息传递来估计片段对模型输出的因果影响，实现片段贡献与预测的强对齐。

Result: 在合成基准测试和真实分子数据集上的广泛评估表明，SEAL在定量归因指标和人类对齐可解释性方面优于其他可解释性方法。用户研究证实SEAL为领域专家提供更直观可信的解释。

Conclusion: SEAL通过弥合预测性能和可解释性之间的差距，为更透明和可操作的分子建模提供了有前景的方向。

Abstract: Graph neural networks have demonstrated remarkable success in predicting
molecular properties by leveraging the rich structural information encoded in
molecular graphs. However, their black-box nature reduces interpretability,
which limits trust in their predictions for important applications such as drug
discovery and materials design. Furthermore, existing explanation techniques
often fail to reliably quantify the contribution of individual atoms or
substructures due to the entangled message-passing dynamics. We introduce SEAL
(Substructure Explanation via Attribution Learning), a new interpretable graph
neural network that attributes model predictions to meaningful molecular
subgraphs. SEAL decomposes input graphs into chemically relevant fragments and
estimates their causal influence on the output. The strong alignment between
fragment contributions and model predictions is achieved by explicitly reducing
inter-fragment message passing in our proposed model architecture. Extensive
evaluations on synthetic benchmarks and real-world molecular datasets
demonstrate that SEAL outperforms other explainability methods in both
quantitative attribution metrics and human-aligned interpretability. A user
study further confirms that SEAL provides more intuitive and trustworthy
explanations to domain experts. By bridging the gap between predictive
performance and interpretability, SEAL offers a promising direction for more
transparent and actionable molecular modeling.

*Carlos Stein Brito*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Twin-Bootstrap Gradient Descent (Twin-Boot) 是一种集成不确定性估计的优化方法，通过在独立bootstrap样本上并行训练两个相同模型，并定期重置均值来保持轨迹在同一basin中，从而提供局部不确定性估计和正则化效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准梯度下降方法只能提供点估计而无法衡量置信度，在过参数化和低数据场景中容易过拟合。传统bootstrap方法在深度学习中使用不切实际，需要训练多个副本且无法指导学习过程。

Method: 训练两个相同模型在独立bootstrap样本上并行训练，通过周期性均值重置保持轨迹在同一basin中，利用模型间的分歧来估计局部不确定性，并以此自适应采样权重进行正则化。

Result: 在深度神经网络和复杂高维逆问题中，该方法提高了校准性和泛化能力，并产生可解释的不确定性映射。

Conclusion: Twin-Boot成功将不确定性估计集成到优化过程中，解决了传统bootstrap在深度学习中的局限性，提供了有效的正则化和不确定性量化。

Abstract: Standard gradient descent methods yield point estimates with no measure of
confidence. This limitation is acute in overparameterized and low-data regimes,
where models have many parameters relative to available data and can easily
overfit. Bootstrapping is a classical statistical framework for uncertainty
estimation based on resampling, but naively applying it to deep learning is
impractical: it requires training many replicas, produces post-hoc estimates
that cannot guide learning, and implicitly assumes comparable optima across
runs - an assumption that fails in non-convex landscapes. We introduce
Twin-Bootstrap Gradient Descent (Twin-Boot), a resampling-based training
procedure that integrates uncertainty estimation into optimization. Two
identical models are trained in parallel on independent bootstrap samples, and
a periodic mean-reset keeps both trajectories in the same basin so that their
divergence reflects local (within-basin) uncertainty. During training, we use
this estimate to sample weights in an adaptive, data-driven way, providing
regularization that favors flatter solutions. In deep neural networks and
complex high-dimensional inverse problems, the approach improves calibration
and generalization and yields interpretable uncertainty maps.

Motivation: 研究联邦学习在线性参数化非线性系统识别中的有效性，探索多客户端协作如何提升系统识别性能，特别是在非主动探索场景下的表现。

Method: 采用联邦学习框架进行非线性系统识别，使用线性参数化的非线性特征映射，在客户端设备使用i.i.d.控制输入和随机扰动策略，确保非主动探索条件。实验基于具有实解析特征函数的非线性动力系统。

Result: 理论分析表明联邦学习的收敛速率随客户端数量增加而提升，非线性情况与线性情况的收敛速率差异仅为一个常数，该常数可通过特征映射的选择来优化。实验结果显示联邦学习能持续改善单个客户端的收敛性能。

Conclusion: 联邦学习为非线性系统识别提供了有效的分布式解决方案，通过多客户端协作可以显著提升识别性能，特征映射的精心选择可以进一步增强系统激励和性能表现。

Abstract: We consider federated learning of linearly-parameterized nonlinear systems.
We establish theoretical guarantees on the effectiveness of federated nonlinear
system identification compared to centralized approaches, demonstrating that
the convergence rate improves as the number of clients increases. Although the
convergence rates in the linear and nonlinear cases differ only by a constant,
this constant depends on the feature map $\phi$, which can be carefully chosen
in the nonlinear setting to increase excitation and improve performance. We
experimentally validate our theory in physical settings where client devices
are driven by i.i.d. control inputs and control policies exhibiting i.i.d.
random perturbations, ensuring non-active exploration. Experiments use
trajectories from nonlinear dynamical systems characterized by real-analytic
feature functions, including polynomial and trigonometric components,
representative of physical systems including pendulum and quadrotor dynamics.
We analyze the convergence behavior of the proposed method under varying noise
levels and data distributions. Results show that federated learning
consistently improves convergence of any individual client as the number of
participating clients increases.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着深度神经网络和数据集规模的增大，训练计算成本显著增加。传统层冻结方法中冻结层仍需前向传播生成特征图，限制了计算成本的降低。现有缓存特征图的方法存在增强应用困难和存储开销大的问题，需要系统性解决方案。

Result: 该方法在保持模型精度的同时显著降低了训练成本，仅产生较小的时间开销；提供了冻结和压缩策略的全面评估，为高效DNN训练优化提供了见解。

Conclusion: 该研究首次全面探索了层冻结缓存方法中的关键挑战，并提供了系统性解决方案，成功实现了训练成本的大幅降低，为深度神经网络的高效训练提供了实用方法。

Abstract: With the growing size of deep neural networks and datasets, the computational
costs of training have significantly increased. The layer-freezing technique
has recently attracted great attention as a promising method to effectively
reduce the cost of network training. However, in traditional layer-freezing
methods, frozen layers are still required for forward propagation to generate
feature maps for unfrozen layers, limiting the reduction of computation costs.
To overcome this, prior works proposed a hypothetical solution, which caches
feature maps from frozen layers as a new dataset, allowing later layers to
train directly on stored feature maps. While this approach appears to be
straightforward, it presents several major challenges that are severely
overlooked by prior literature, such as how to effectively apply augmentations
to feature maps and the substantial storage overhead introduced. If these
overlooked challenges are not addressed, the performance of the caching method
will be severely impacted and even make it infeasible. This paper is the first
to comprehensively explore these challenges and provides a systematic solution.
To improve training accuracy, we propose \textit{similarity-aware channel
augmentation}, which caches channels with high augmentation sensitivity with a
minimum additional storage cost. To mitigate storage overhead, we incorporate
lossy data compression into layer freezing and design a \textit{progressive
compression} strategy, which increases compression rates as more layers are
frozen, effectively reducing storage costs. Finally, our solution achieves
significant reductions in training cost while maintaining model accuracy, with
a minor time overhead. Additionally, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of
freezing and compression strategies, providing insights into optimizing their
application for efficient DNN training.

TL;DR: 该论文研究了在异质腐败率下的鲁棒估计问题，为多元有界分布和单变量高斯分布的均值估计提供了紧的极小极大率，并为多元高斯均值估计和线性回归建立了平方误差的极小极大率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在分布式学习、联邦学习、众包和传感器网络等应用中，样本可能以已知但非相同的概率独立腐败，而现有的鲁棒估计器通常假设均匀或最坏情况腐败，忽略了结构性异质性。

Method: 针对多元有界分布和单变量高斯分布的均值估计问题，给出了所有异质腐败模式的紧极小极大率；对于多元高斯均值估计和线性回归，建立了平方误差的极小极大率。

Result: 研究发现，超过特定腐败阈值的样本可能被最优估计器丢弃，该阈值由给定的腐败率经验分布决定。

Conclusion: 该研究为异质腐败环境下的鲁棒估计提供了理论保证，揭示了最优估计器在处理异质腐败时的样本选择策略。

Abstract: We study the problem of robust estimation under heterogeneous corruption
rates, where each sample may be independently corrupted with a known but
non-identical probability. This setting arises naturally in distributed and
federated learning, crowdsourcing, and sensor networks, yet existing robust
estimators typically assume uniform or worst-case corruption, ignoring
structural heterogeneity. For mean estimation for multivariate bounded
distributions and univariate gaussian distributions, we give tight minimax
rates for all heterogeneous corruption patterns. For multivariate gaussian mean
estimation and linear regression, we establish the minimax rate for squared
error up to a factor of $\sqrt{d}$, where $d$ is the dimension. Roughly, our
findings suggest that samples beyond a certain corruption threshold may be
discarded by the optimal estimators -- this threshold is determined by the
empirical distribution of the corruption rates given.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代优化算法对超参数（特别是步长）选择高度敏感，调参过程困难且耗时。需要开发更稳定的优化器来减少对超参数选择的依赖。

Method: 提出NGN-M算法，将NGN步长方法与动量机制相结合，通过新颖的步长自适应方法实现稳定优化。

Result: 算法在较宽松的假设条件下达到O(1/√K)的标准收敛速率，无需插值条件或有界梯度假设。实证显示对步长超参数选择具有更强鲁棒性，性能达到或超越现有最优方法。

Conclusion: NGN-M算法成功解决了优化器对步长超参数敏感的问题，在保持高性能的同时显著提升了稳定性，为深度学习优化提供了更实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Modern optimization algorithms that incorporate momentum and adaptive
step-size offer improved performance in numerous challenging deep learning
tasks. However, their effectiveness is often highly sensitive to the choice of
hyperparameters, especially the step-size. Tuning these parameters is often
difficult, resource-intensive, and time-consuming. Therefore, recent efforts
have been directed toward enhancing the stability of optimizers across a wide
range of hyperparameter choices [Schaipp et al., 2024]. In this paper, we
introduce an algorithm that matches the performance of state-of-the-art
optimizers while improving stability to the choice of the step-size
hyperparameter through a novel adaptation of the NGN step-size method [Orvieto
and Xiao, 2024]. Specifically, we propose a momentum-based version (NGN-M) that
attains the standard convergence rate of $\mathcal{O}(1/\sqrt{K})$ under less
restrictive assumptions, without the need for interpolation condition or
assumptions of bounded stochastic gradients or iterates, in contrast to
previous approaches. Additionally, we empirically demonstrate that the
combination of the NGN step-size with momentum results in enhanced robustness
to the choice of the step-size hyperparameter while delivering performance that
is comparable to or surpasses other state-of-the-art optimizers.

Motivation: 研究深度神经网络中"愚弄样本"现象，即DNN对看似随机的输入产生高置信度分类，旨在理解DNN在过参数化状态下的泛化行为机制。

Method: 采用基于最大似然估计的分析框架，避免依赖梯度优化和显式标签的传统数值方法，分析DNN在过参数化状态下的特征空间变化。

Result: 发现DNN在过参数化状态下会出现输出特征空间崩溃，虽然改善泛化但最终导致退化状态；提出的"虫洞"解决方案能绕过退化，协调随机输入与有意义的标签。

Conclusion: 研究为理解DNN泛化机制提供了新见解，揭示了特征空间崩溃与退化现象，提出的虫洞解决方案为未来无监督学习动力学研究指明了方向，有助于弥合理论与实践的差距。

Abstract: This work investigates the generalization behavior of deep neural networks
(DNNs), focusing on the phenomenon of "fooling examples," where DNNs
confidently classify inputs that appear random or unstructured to humans. To
explore this phenomenon, we introduce an analytical framework based on maximum
likelihood estimation, without adhering to conventional numerical approaches
that rely on gradient-based optimization and explicit labels. Our analysis
reveals that DNNs operating in an overparameterized regime exhibit a collapse
in the output feature space. While this collapse improves network
generalization, adding more layers eventually leads to a state of degeneracy,
where the model learns trivial solutions by mapping distinct inputs to the same
output, resulting in zero loss. Further investigation demonstrates that this
degeneracy can be bypassed using our newly derived "wormhole" solution. The
wormhole solution, when applied to arbitrary fooling examples, reconciles
meaningful labels with random ones and provides a novel perspective on shortcut
learning. These findings offer deeper insights into DNN generalization and
highlight directions for future research on learning dynamics in unsupervised
settings to bridge the gap between theory and practice.

TL;DR: 本文首次系统评估稀疏自编码器(SAE)在单语义性方面的表现，提出基于Jensen-Shannon距离的概念可分离性评分，发现SAE能减少多义性但稀疏度增加不一定提升性能，并开发了新的干预方法APP。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型存在多义性问题，即神经元对多个不相关概念都有激活。虽然稀疏自编码器被提出用于缓解此问题，但缺乏与基础模型的定量比较。

Method: 引入基于Jensen-Shannon距离的细粒度概念可分离性评分，使用Gemma-2-2B模型和多种SAE变体在五个基准测试上进行评估，并提出新的干预方法APP。

Result: SAE减少了多义性并实现了更高的概念可分离性，但更大的稀疏性并不总是带来更好的可分离性，且经常损害下游性能。APP方法在目标概念移除方面优于现有方法。

Conclusion: SAE确实能提升模型的可解释性，但需要在稀疏性和性能之间找到平衡。新提出的APP方法为精确的概念级控制提供了有效手段。

Abstract: A key barrier to interpreting large language models is polysemanticity, where
neurons activate for multiple unrelated concepts. Sparse autoencoders (SAEs)
have been proposed to mitigate this issue by transforming dense activations
into sparse, more interpretable features. While prior work suggests that SAEs
promote monosemanticity, there has been no quantitative comparison with their
base models. This paper provides the first systematic evaluation of SAEs
against base models concerning monosemanticity. We introduce a fine-grained
concept separability score based on the Jensen-Shannon distance, which captures
how distinctly a neuron's activation distributions vary across concepts. Using
Gemma-2-2B and multiple SAE variants across five benchmarks, we show that SAEs
reduce polysemanticity and achieve higher concept separability. However,
greater sparsity of SAEs does not always yield better separability and often
impairs downstream performance. To assess practical utility, we evaluate
concept-level interventions using two strategies: full neuron masking and
partial suppression. We find that, compared to base models, SAEs enable more
precise concept-level control when using partial suppression. Building on this,
we propose Attenuation via Posterior Probabilities (APP), a new intervention
method that uses concept-conditioned activation distributions for targeted
suppression. APP outperforms existing approaches in targeted concept removal.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决传统Transformer在长上下文处理中的计算复杂度和内存消耗问题，需要设计更高效的架构来结合状态空间模型的计算效率、稀疏注意力的选择性和专家混合的容量扩展能力。

Method: 集成Mamba风格的结构化状态空间模型(SSM)主干，间歇性稀疏全局注意力，分块级MoE前馈路由，以及双内存系统(工作内存+事实PKM内存)，采用分阶段课程学习稳定激活各组件。

Result: 通过小规模原型实验(数千万参数)验证了实现可行性，展示了长上下文吞吐量交叉和可控专家路由等定性扩展行为，但未声称具有竞争性的全规模性能。

Conclusion: Hydra为模块化、输入自适应的长上下文语言模型提供了一条可行路径，结合了SSM效率、选择性稀疏注意力、MoE容量和可学习内存，但最终任务性能验证仍需未来大规模实验。

Abstract: We present Hydra as an architectural proposal for hybrid long-context
language models that combine conditional computation, long-context memory
mechanisms, and sparse mixture-of-experts within an approximately 1.6B
parameter design envelope. Hydra integrates a Mamba-style Structured State
Space Model (SSM) backbone with intermittent sparse global attention,
chunk-level MoE feed-forward routing, and dual (workspace plus factual PKM)
memories. We formalize the component interfaces, give transparent parameter and
complexity accounting, and outline a staged curriculum intended to stably
activate the parts. We accompany the specification with illustrative toy-scale
prototype measurements (tens of millions of parameters on synthetic data) whose
sole purpose is to demonstrate implementation feasibility and qualitative
scaling behaviors (for example, long-context throughput crossover and
controllable expert routing), not to claim competitive full-scale performance.
We explicitly delineate assumptions and open risks (training complexity, memory
utilization, specialization dynamics) and position Hydra as a blueprint to
stimulate empirical follow-up rather than a finished system. By combining SSM
efficiency, selective sparse attention, MoE capacity, and learnable memory,
Hydra sketches a path toward modular, input-adaptive long-context language
models; validating end-task gains at target scale remains future work.

Conclusion: 当前的概念擦除技术存在严重漏洞，需要更鲁棒的解决方案。作者发布了数据集、代码和评估工具以支持未来研究。

Abstract: Concerns about text-to-image (T2I) generative models infringing on privacy,
copyright, and safety have led to the development of Concept Erasure Techniques
(CETs).
  The goal of an effective CET is to prohibit the generation of undesired
``target'' concepts specified by the user, while preserving the ability to
synthesize high-quality images of the remaining concepts.
  In this work, we demonstrate that CETs can be easily circumvented and present
several side effects of concept erasure.
  For a comprehensive measurement of the robustness of CETs, we present Side
Effect Evaluation (\see), an evaluation benchmark that consists of hierarchical
and compositional prompts that describe objects and their attributes.
  This dataset and our automated evaluation pipeline quantify side effects of
CETs across three aspects: impact on neighboring concepts, evasion of targets,
and attribute leakage.
  Our experiments reveal that CETs can be circumvented by using
superclass-subclass hierarchy and semantically similar prompts, such as
compositional variants of the target. We show that CETs suffer from attribute
leakage and counterintuitive phenomena of attention concentration or dispersal.
  We release our dataset, code, and evaluation tools to aid future work on
robust concept erasure.

Abstract: As machine learning becomes more pervasive and data privacy regulations
evolve, the ability to remove private or copyrighted information from trained
models is becoming an increasingly critical requirement. Existing unlearning
methods often rely on the assumption of having access to the entire training
dataset during the forgetting process. However, this assumption may not hold
true in practical scenarios where the original training data may not be
accessible, i.e., the source-free setting. To address this challenge, we focus
on the source-free unlearning scenario, where an unlearning algorithm must be
capable of removing specific data from a trained model without requiring access
to the original training dataset. Building on recent work, we present a method
that can estimate the Hessian of the unknown remaining training data, a crucial
component required for efficient unlearning. Leveraging this estimation
technique, our method enables efficient zero-shot unlearning while providing
robust theoretical guarantees on the unlearning performance, while maintaining
performance on the remaining data. Extensive experiments over a wide range of
datasets verify the efficacy of our method.

Motivation: 传统强化学习缺乏统一的数学框架来处理各种动态系统模型，需要一种更通用的范畴化方法来统一建模MDPs、POMDPs、PSRs等系统，并提供异步分布式计算的数学基础。

Method: 使用范畴论和函子对RL进行建模，将算法空间建模为函子范畴；引入通用余代数框架，将动态系统统一为余代数特例；通过度量余归纳和异步收敛定理来求解固定点问题。

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a categorial generalization of RL, termed
universal reinforcement learning (URL), building on powerful mathematical
abstractions from the study of coinduction on non-well-founded sets and
universal coalgebras, topos theory, and categorial models of asynchronous
parallel distributed computation. In the first half of the paper, we review the
basic RL framework, illustrate the use of categories and functors in RL,
showing how they lead to interesting insights. In particular, we also introduce
a standard model of asynchronous distributed minimization proposed by Bertsekas
and Tsitsiklis, and describe the relationship between metric coinduction and
their proof of the Asynchronous Convergence Theorem. The space of algorithms
for MDPs or PSRs can be modeled as a functor category, where the co-domain
category forms a topos, which admits all (co)limits, possesses a subobject
classifier, and has exponential objects. In the second half of the paper, we
move on to universal coalgebras. Dynamical system models, such as Markov
decision processes (MDPs), partially observed MDPs (POMDPs), a predictive state
representation (PSRs), and linear dynamical systems (LDSs) are all special
types of coalgebras. We describe a broad family of universal coalgebras,
extending the dynamic system models studied previously in RL. The core problem
in finding fixed points in RL to determine the exact or approximate (action)
value function is generalized in URL to determining the final coalgebra

Abstract: There is a flurry of recent research papers proposing novel differentially
private machine learning (DPML) techniques. These papers claim to achieve new
state-of-the-art (SoTA) results and offer empirical results as validation.
However, there is no consensus on which techniques are most effective or if
they genuinely meet their stated claims. Complicating matters, heterogeneity in
codebases, datasets, methodologies, and model architectures make direct
comparisons of different approaches challenging.
  In this paper, we conduct a reproducibility and replicability (R+R)
experiment on 11 different SoTA DPML techniques from the recent research
literature. Results of our investigation are varied: while some methods stand
up to scrutiny, others falter when tested outside their initial experimental
conditions. We also discuss challenges unique to the reproducibility of DPML,
including additional randomness due to DP noise, and how to address them.
Finally, we derive insights and best practices to obtain scientifically valid
and reliable results.

*Xiangman Li,Xiaodong Wu,Qi Li,Jianbing Ni,Rongxing Lu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SafeLLM是一个基于遗忘学习的防御框架，通过三阶段流程检测和消除LLM中的有害知识，在保持模型通用能力的同时显著降低越狱攻击成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 越狱攻击通过制作对抗性提示绕过LLM的对齐机制，导致模型产生有害内容，严重威胁LLM的安全性。

Method: 三阶段流程：1) 混合方法动态检测不安全输出；2) 通过FFN激活进行词级有害内容追踪定位有害知识；3) 约束优化抑制不安全行为而不降低模型质量

Result: 在多个LLM和越狱基准测试中，SafeLLM显著降低攻击成功率，同时保持高通用性能，比标准防御方法提供更强的安全保证和鲁棒性

Conclusion: 遗忘学习是LLM安全领域的一个有前景的方向，SafeLLM展示了其在可扩展和有效安全防护方面的潜力

Abstract: Jailbreak attacks pose a serious threat to the safety of Large Language
Models (LLMs) by crafting adversarial prompts that bypass alignment mechanisms,
causing the models to produce harmful, restricted, or biased content. In this
paper, we propose SafeLLM, a novel unlearning-based defense framework that
unlearn the harmful knowledge from LLMs while preserving linguistic fluency and
general capabilities. SafeLLM employs a three-stage pipeline: (1) dynamic
unsafe output detection using a hybrid approach that integrates external
classifiers with model-internal evaluations; (2) token-level harmful content
tracing through feedforward network (FFN) activations to localize harmful
knowledge; and (3) constrained optimization to suppress unsafe behavior without
degrading overall model quality. SafeLLM achieves targeted and irreversible
forgetting by identifying and neutralizing FFN substructures responsible for
harmful generation pathways. Extensive experiments on prominent LLMs (Vicuna,
LLaMA, and GPT-J) across multiple jailbreak benchmarks show that SafeLLM
substantially reduces attack success rates while maintaining high
general-purpose performance. Compared to standard defense methods such as
supervised fine-tuning and direct preference optimization, SafeLLM offers
stronger safety guarantees, more precise control over harmful behavior, and
greater robustness to unseen attacks. Moreover, SafeLLM maintains the general
performance after the harmful knowledge unlearned. These results highlight
unlearning as a promising direction for scalable and effective LLM safety.

Conclusion: FairPrep填补了公平性基准测试领域的关键空白，通过提供标准化管道和支持可重复评估，为推进数据层面公平性研究提供了实用工具。

Abstract: As machine learning systems become increasingly integrated into high-stakes
decision-making processes, ensuring fairness in algorithmic outcomes has become
a critical concern. Methods to mitigate bias typically fall into three
categories: pre-processing, in-processing, and post-processing. While
significant attention has been devoted to the latter two, pre-processing
methods, which operate at the data level and offer advantages such as
model-agnosticism and improved privacy compliance, have received comparatively
less focus and lack standardised evaluation tools. In this work, we introduce
FairPrep, an extensible and modular benchmarking framework designed to evaluate
fairness-aware pre-processing techniques on tabular datasets. Built on the
AIF360 platform, FairPrep allows seamless integration of datasets, fairness
interventions, and predictive models. It features a batch-processing interface
that enables efficient experimentation and automatic reporting of fairness and
utility metrics. By offering standardised pipelines and supporting reproducible
evaluations, FairPrep fills a critical gap in the fairness benchmarking
landscape and provides a practical foundation for advancing data-level fairness
research.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种频率自适应的张量神经网络算法，通过引入随机傅里叶特征和利用张量结构进行一维傅里叶变换，有效解决了传统TNN在高维多尺度问题中捕捉高频特征的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 张量神经网络(TNNs)在处理高维问题时表现出色，但与传统神经网络一样受到频率原理的限制，难以准确捕捉解的高频特征，这限制了其在复杂多尺度问题中的应用。

Method: 1. 通过傅里叶分析研究TNNs的训练动态；2. 引入随机傅里叶特征增强表达能力；3. 利用TNNs的张量结构，对一维分量函数进行离散傅里叶变换来提取高维函数的频率特征；4. 提出频率自适应TNNs算法。

Conclusion: 通过结合随机傅里叶特征和利用张量结构进行频率分析，频率自适应TNNs算法成功克服了传统方法在高维多尺度问题中的频率限制，为复杂问题的求解提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Tensor neural networks (TNNs) have demonstrated their superiority in solving
high-dimensional problems. However, similar to conventional neural networks,
TNNs are also influenced by the Frequency Principle, which limits their ability
to accurately capture high-frequency features of the solution. In this work, we
analyze the training dynamics of TNNs by Fourier analysis and enhance their
expressivity for high-dimensional multi-scale problems by incorporating random
Fourier features. Leveraging the inherent tensor structure of TNNs, we further
propose a novel approach to extract frequency features of high-dimensional
functions by performing the Discrete Fourier Transform to one-dimensional
component functions. This strategy effectively mitigates the curse of
dimensionality. Building on this idea, we propose a frequency-adaptive TNNs
algorithm, which significantly improves the ability of TNNs in solving complex
multi-scale problems. Extensive numerical experiments are performed to validate
the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed frequency-adaptive TNNs
algorithm.

Abstract: Classification of sleep stages is essential for assessing sleep quality and
diagnosing sleep disorders such as insomnia. However, manual inspection of EEG
characteristics for each stage is time-consuming and prone to human error.
Although machine learning and deep learning methods have been actively
developed, they continue to face challenges from the non-stationarity and
variability of electroencephalography (EEG) and electrooculography (EOG)
signals, often leading to poor generalization on unseen datasets. This research
proposed a Sleep Stage Classification method by developing Multivariate
Differential Transformer (SleepDIFFormer) for joint EEG and EOG representation
learning. Specifically, SleepDIFFormer was developed to process EEG and EOG
signals using our Multivariate Differential Transformer Architecture (MDTA) for
time series, trained with cross-domain alignment. Our method mitigated spatial
and temporal attention noise while learning a domain-invariant joint EEG-EOG
representation through feature distribution alignment, thereby enabling
generalization to unseen target datasets. Empirically, we evaluated our method
on five different sleep staging datasets and compared it with existing
approaches, achieving state-of-the-art performance. We also conducted thorough
ablation analyses of SleepDIFFormer and interpreted the differential attention
weights, highlighting their relevance to characteristic sleep EEG patterns.
These findings have implications for advancing automated sleep stage
classification and its application to sleep quality assessment. Our source code

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种多归因学习框架(MAL)，用于整合多种归因视角来改善转化率预测的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法只使用单一归因机制的标签，忽略了其他归因视角的优势信息，导致模型表现次优。

Method: 设计了包含归因知识聚合器(AKA)和主要目标预测器(PTP)的联合学习框架，并提出CAT训练策略来产生丰富的监督信号。

Result: 离线实验显示GAUC提升0.51%，在线实验显示ROI提升2.6%，性能显著优于单一归因学习基线。

Conclusion: MAL框架通过整合多种归因视角，能够更好地抓取用户转化的深层模式，同时保持与产业部署要求的直接兼容性。

Abstract: Conversion rate (CVR) prediction is a core component of online advertising
systems, where the attribution mechanisms-rules for allocating conversion
credit across user touchpoints-fundamentally determine label generation and
model optimization. While many industrial platforms support diverse attribution
mechanisms (e.g., First-Click, Last-Click, Linear, and Data-Driven Multi-Touch
Attribution), conventional approaches restrict model training to labels from a
single production-critical attribution mechanism, discarding complementary
signals in alternative attribution perspectives.
  To address this limitation, we propose a novel Multi-Attribution Learning
(MAL) framework for CVR prediction that integrates signals from multiple
attribution perspectives to better capture the underlying patterns driving user
conversions. Specifically, MAL is a joint learning framework consisting of two
core components: the Attribution Knowledge Aggregator (AKA) and the Primary
Target Predictor (PTP). AKA is implemented as a multi-task learner that
integrates knowledge extracted from diverse attribution labels. PTP, in
contrast, focuses on the task of generating well-calibrated conversion
probabilities that align with the system-optimized attribution metric (e.g.,
CVR under the Last-Click attribution), ensuring direct compatibility with
industrial deployment requirements. Additionally, we propose CAT, a novel
training strategy that leverages the Cartesian product of all attribution label
combinations to generate enriched supervision signals. This design
substantially enhances the performance of the attribution knowledge aggregator.
Empirical evaluations demonstrate the superiority of MAL over
single-attribution learning baselines, achieving +0.51% GAUC improvement on
offline metrics. Online experiments demonstrate that MAL achieved a +2.6%
increase in ROI (Return on Investment).

Motivation: 现有方法在合成多目标解释时要么缺乏帕累托最优性的形式保证，要么在探索帕累托最优空间时面临严重的可扩展性限制。

Method: 使用多目标学习或搜索技术生成帕累托最优候选解，然后通过SAT求解器将每个候选解的局部最优性验证转化为布尔可满足性问题。

Result: 在基准测试中证明该方法有效，生成的解释与提供全局保证的方法合成的解释非常接近。

Conclusion: 该框架能够在保证局部最优性的同时，实现更可扩展的帕累托最优解释合成。

Abstract: Creating meaningful interpretations for black-box machine learning models
involves balancing two often conflicting objectives: accuracy and
explainability. Exploring the trade-off between these objectives is essential
for developing trustworthy interpretations. While many techniques for
multi-objective interpretation synthesis have been developed, they typically
lack formal guarantees on the Pareto-optimality of the results. Methods that do
provide such guarantees, on the other hand, often face severe scalability
limitations when exploring the Pareto-optimal space. To address this, we
develop a framework based on local optimality guarantees that enables more
scalable synthesis of interpretations. Specifically, we consider the problem of
synthesizing a set of Pareto-optimal interpretations with local optimality
guarantees, within the immediate neighborhood of each solution. Our approach
begins with a multi-objective learning or search technique, such as
Multi-Objective Monte Carlo Tree Search, to generate a best-effort set of
Pareto-optimal candidates with respect to accuracy and explainability. We then
verify local optimality for each candidate as a Boolean satisfiability problem,
which we solve using a SAT solver. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach
on a set of benchmarks, comparing it against previous methods for exploring the
Pareto-optimal front of interpretations. In particular, we show that our
approach yields interpretations that closely match those synthesized by methods
offering global guarantees.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统自监督对比学习方法只能生成成对的增强视图，无法充分利用ECG记录中丰富的时间结构信息，限制了模型性能。

Method: 采用多窗口对比学习框架，从每个ECG实例提取多个时间窗口构建正样本对，通过统计方法最大化窗口间一致性，并借鉴慢特征分析原理学习时间不变性特征。

Result: 在PTB-XL数据集上，多窗口对比学习在多标签超类分类中表现优于传统双视图方法，AUROC达到0.891（vs 0.888），F1分数0.680（vs 0.679），预训练epoch减少4倍（32 vs 128），总预训练时间减少14.8%。

Conclusion: 多窗口对比学习为ECG分析提供了一种高效可扩展的自监督学习范式，也为生物医学时间序列数据的表示学习提供了有前景的通用框架。

Abstract: Electrocardiogram (ECG) analysis is foundational for cardiovascular disease
diagnosis, yet the performance of deep learning models is often constrained by
limited access to annotated data. Self-supervised contrastive learning has
emerged as a powerful approach for learning robust ECG representations from
unlabeled signals. However, most existing methods generate only pairwise
augmented views and fail to leverage the rich temporal structure of ECG
recordings. In this work, we present a poly-window contrastive learning
framework. We extract multiple temporal windows from each ECG instance to
construct positive pairs and maximize their agreement via statistics. Inspired
by the principle of slow feature analysis, our approach explicitly encourages
the model to learn temporally invariant and physiologically meaningful features
that persist across time. We validate our approach through extensive
experiments and ablation studies on the PTB-XL dataset. Our results demonstrate
that poly-window contrastive learning consistently outperforms conventional
two-view methods in multi-label superclass classification, achieving higher
AUROC (0.891 vs. 0.888) and F1 scores (0.680 vs. 0.679) while requiring up to
four times fewer pre-training epochs (32 vs. 128) and 14.8% in total wall clock
pre-training time reduction. Despite processing multiple windows per sample, we
achieve a significant reduction in the number of training epochs and total
computation time, making our method practical for training foundational models.
Through extensive ablations, we identify optimal design choices and demonstrate
robustness across various hyperparameters. These findings establish poly-window
contrastive learning as a highly efficient and scalable paradigm for automated
ECG analysis and provide a promising general framework for self-supervised
representation learning in biomedical time-series data.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown great potential in reasoning tasks

However, this approach often leads to diminishing returns in accuracy and high
computational overhead. To address these challenges, we introduce Deep Think

reasoning efficiency and performance at test time. DeepConf leverages
model-internal confidence signals to dynamically filter out low-quality
reasoning traces during or after generation. It requires no additional model
training or hyperparameter tuning and can be seamlessly integrated into
existing serving frameworks. We evaluate DeepConf across a variety of reasoning
tasks and the latest open-source models, including Qwen 3 and GPT-OSS series.
Notably, on challenging benchmarks such as AIME 2025, DeepConf@512 achieves up
to 99.9% accuracy and reduces generated tokens by up to 84.7% compared to full

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解数据集复杂度对于评估知识图谱链接预测模型至关重要，但之前提出的CSG指标在KG环境中尚未得到验证，需要系统评估其有效性和稳定性。

Method: 在多关系链接预测背景下评估CSG指标，引入transformer嵌入的语义表示，并提出并基准测试一组结构和语义KG复杂度指标，包括关系熵、最大关系多样性等。

Result: CSG对参数高度敏感，不能稳健地随类别数量扩展，与MRR和Hit@1的相关性弱或不一致。关系熵、最大关系多样性和关系类型基数等指标与性能指标呈现强负相关。

Conclusion: CSG在链接预测设置中的稳定性和泛化预测能力不成立，需要更稳定、可解释且与任务对齐的数据集复杂度度量方法。

Abstract: Understanding dataset complexity is fundamental to evaluating and comparing
link prediction models on knowledge graphs (KGs). While the Cumulative Spectral
Gradient (CSG) metric, derived from probabilistic divergence between classes
within a spectral clustering framework, has been proposed as a classifier
agnostic complexity metric purportedly scaling with class cardinality and
correlating with downstream performance, it has not been evaluated in KG
settings so far. In this work, we critically examine CSG in the context of
multi relational link prediction, incorporating semantic representations via
transformer derived embeddings. Contrary to prior claims, we find that CSG is
highly sensitive to parametrisation and does not robustly scale with the number
of classes. Moreover, it exhibits weak or inconsistent correlation with
standard performance metrics such as Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR) and Hit@1. To
deepen the analysis, we introduce and benchmark a set of structural and
semantic KG complexity metrics. Our findings reveal that global and local
relational ambiguity captured via Relation Entropy, node level Maximum Relation
Diversity, and Relation Type Cardinality exhibit strong inverse correlations
with MRR and Hit@1, suggesting these as more faithful indicators of task
difficulty. Conversely, graph connectivity measures such as Average Degree,
Degree Entropy, PageRank, and Eigenvector Centrality correlate positively with
Hit@10. Our results demonstrate that CSGs purported stability and
generalization predictive power fail to hold in link prediction settings and
underscore the need for more stable, interpretable, and task-aligned measures
of dataset complexity in knowledge driven learning.

Abstract: Generalization remains a significant challenge in visual classification
tasks, particularly in handling unknown classes in real-world applications.
Existing research focuses on the class discovery paradigm, which tends to favor
known classes, and the incremental learning paradigm, which suffers from
catastrophic forgetting. Recent approaches such as the L-Reg technique employ
logic-based regularization to enhance generalization but are bound by the
necessity of fully defined logical formulas, limiting flexibility for unknown
classes. This paper introduces PL-Reg, a novel partial-logic regularization
term that allows models to reserve space for undefined logic formulas,
improving adaptability to unknown classes. Specifically, we formally
demonstrate that tasks involving unknown classes can be effectively explained
using partial logic. We also prove that methods based on partial logic lead to
improved generalization. We validate PL-Reg through extensive experiments on
Generalized Category Discovery, Multi-Domain Generalized Category Discovery,
and long-tailed Class Incremental Learning tasks, demonstrating consistent
performance improvements. Our results highlight the effectiveness of partial
logic in tackling challenges related to unknown classes.

Abstract: In user-centric design, persona development plays a vital role in
understanding user behaviour, capturing needs, segmenting audiences, and
guiding design decisions. However, the growing complexity of user interactions
calls for a more contextualized approach to ensure designs align with real user
needs. While earlier studies have advanced persona classification by modelling
user behaviour, capturing contextual information, especially by integrating
textual and tabular data, remains a key challenge. These models also often lack
explainability, leaving their predictions difficult to interpret or justify. To
address these limitations, we present ExBigBang (Explainable BigBang), a hybrid
text-tabular approach that uses transformer-based architectures to model rich
contextual features for persona classification. ExBigBang incorporates
metadata, domain knowledge, and user profiling to embed deeper context into
predictions. Through a cyclical process of user profiling and classification,
our approach dynamically updates to reflect evolving user behaviours.
Experiments on a benchmark persona classification dataset demonstrate the
robustness of our model. An ablation study confirms the benefits of combining
text and tabular data, while Explainable AI techniques shed light on the
rationale behind the model's predictions.

TL;DR: 用户可以通过协调重新标记自己的数据来提升模型公平性，无需改变企业训练过程，少数群体的小规模行动就能显著减少不公平性且对预测误差影响很小


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机器学习模型经常保留训练数据中的偏见，导致对某些少数群体的不公平对待。现有的企业端偏见缓解技术通常需要付出效用成本和组织支持，而许多模型依赖用户贡献数据，因此用户可以通过算法集体行动来诱导公平性

Method: 提出了三种实用的、模型无关的方法来近似理想的重新标记，并在真实数据集上进行了验证。这些方法允许协调的少数群体战略性地重新标记自己的数据

Result: 研究发现，少数群体的一个子群可以显著减少不公平性，同时对整体预测误差的影响很小

Conclusion: 通过算法集体行动框架，用户可以通过战略性数据重新标记来有效提升模型公平性，这种方法实用且对模型性能影响有限

Abstract: Machine learning models often preserve biases present in training data,
leading to unfair treatment of certain minority groups. Despite an array of
existing firm-side bias mitigation techniques, they typically incur utility
costs and require organizational buy-in. Recognizing that many models rely on
user-contributed data, end-users can induce fairness through the framework of
Algorithmic Collective Action, where a coordinated minority group strategically
relabels its own data to enhance fairness, without altering the firm's training
process. We propose three practical, model-agnostic methods to approximate
ideal relabeling and validate them on real-world datasets. Our findings show
that a subgroup of the minority can substantially reduce unfairness with a
small impact on the overall prediction error.

*Haodi Zhong,Liuxin Zou,Di Wang,Bo Wang,Zhenxing Niu,Quan Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: EvoFormer是一个针对动态图级表示学习的Transformer框架，通过结构感知和时间敏感模块解决结构访问偏差和突变演化盲点问题，在多个基准测试中达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有动态图嵌入方法存在两个关键问题：结构访问偏差（随机游走采样过度强调高度数节点）和突变演化盲点（无法有效检测突然结构变化），需要新的框架来解决这些问题。

Method: 提出EvoFormer框架，包含：1）结构感知Transformer模块，通过基于节点结构角色的位置编码来区分节点结构；2）演化敏感时间模块，采用三步策略：随机游走时间戳分类、图级时间分割、段感知时间自注意力结合边演化预测任务。

Result: 在五个基准数据集上的广泛评估表明，EvoFormer在图相似性排名、时间异常检测和时间分割任务中实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: EvoFormer通过纠正结构和时间偏差，有效解决了动态图嵌入中的关键挑战，验证了其在捕获结构演化趋势方面的有效性。

Abstract: Dynamic graph-level embedding aims to capture structural evolution in
networks, which is essential for modeling real-world scenarios. However,
existing methods face two critical yet under-explored issues: Structural Visit
Bias, where random walk sampling disproportionately emphasizes high-degree
nodes, leading to redundant and noisy structural representations; and Abrupt
Evolution Blindness, the failure to effectively detect sudden structural
changes due to rigid or overly simplistic temporal modeling strategies,
resulting in inconsistent temporal embeddings. To overcome these challenges, we
propose EvoFormer, an evolution-aware Transformer framework tailored for
dynamic graph-level representation learning. To mitigate Structural Visit Bias,
EvoFormer introduces a Structure-Aware Transformer Module that incorporates
positional encoding based on node structural roles, allowing the model to
globally differentiate and accurately represent node structures. To overcome
Abrupt Evolution Blindness, EvoFormer employs an Evolution-Sensitive Temporal
Module, which explicitly models temporal evolution through a sequential
three-step strategy: (I) Random Walk Timestamp Classification, generating
initial timestamp-aware graph-level embeddings; (II) Graph-Level Temporal
Segmentation, partitioning the graph stream into segments reflecting
structurally coherent periods; and (III) Segment-Aware Temporal Self-Attention
combined with an Edge Evolution Prediction task, enabling the model to
precisely capture segment boundaries and perceive structural evolution trends,
effectively adapting to rapid temporal shifts. Extensive evaluations on five
benchmark datasets confirm that EvoFormer achieves state-of-the-art performance
in graph similarity ranking, temporal anomaly detection, and temporal
segmentation tasks, validating its effectiveness in correcting structural and
temporal biases.

Conclusion: CITE数据集填补了异质文本属性图基准的空白，为相关研究提供了标准化评估平台，推动了该领域的发展。

Abstract: Text-attributed graphs(TAGs) are pervasive in real-world systems,where each
node carries its own textual features. In many cases these graphs are
inherently heterogeneous, containing multiple node types and diverse edge
types. Despite the ubiquity of such heterogeneous TAGs, there remains a lack of
large-scale benchmark datasets. This shortage has become a critical bottleneck,
hindering the development and fair comparison of representation learning
methods on heterogeneous text-attributed graphs. In this paper, we introduce
CITE - Catalytic Information Textual Entities Graph, the first and largest
heterogeneous text-attributed citation graph benchmark for catalytic materials.
CITE comprises over 438K nodes and 1.2M edges, spanning four relation types. In
addition, we establish standardized evaluation procedures and conduct extensive
benchmarking on the node classification task, as well as ablation experiments
on the heterogeneous and textual properties of CITE. We compare four classes of
learning paradigms, including homogeneous graph models, heterogeneous graph
models, LLM(Large Language Model)-centric models, and LLM+Graph models. In a
nutshell, we provide (i) an overview of the CITE dataset, (ii) standardized
evaluation protocols, and (iii) baseline and ablation experiments across
diverse modeling paradigms.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法需要预先确定聚类数量，而联邦学习环境下数据分散在各客户端，需要一种能够动态适应数据变化的聚类方法

Method: 在联邦学习框架下实现演化模糊系统，使用PyTorch实现，模型在客户端本地训练，仅共享模型参数而非原始数据

Result: 在聚类和分类任务上测试显示，该方法在多个UCI数据集上优于现有分类方法，尽管重叠条件计算导致计算量较大

Conclusion: 该方法在去中心化数据处理方面具有显著优势，能够有效适应联邦学习环境下的动态数据变化

Abstract: In this study, we present an Evolving Fuzzy System within the context of
Federated Learning, which adapts dynamically with the addition of new clusters
and therefore does not require the number of clusters to be selected apriori.
Unlike traditional methods, Federated Learning allows models to be trained
locally on clients' devices, sharing only the model parameters with a central
server instead of the data. Our method, implemented using PyTorch, was tested
on clustering and classification tasks. The results show that our approach
outperforms established classification methods on several well-known UCI
datasets. While computationally intensive due to overlap condition
calculations, the proposed method demonstrates significant advantages in
decentralized data processing.

*Jun Choi,Chang-Ock Lee,Minam Moon*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种混合最小二乘法/梯度下降法来加速DeepONet训练，通过将大型线性系统分解为两个更小的子问题分别求解


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DeepONet输出相对于分支网络最后一层参数是线性的，这些参数可以用最小二乘法优化，但直接求解所有分支和主干输入组合的大型线性系统计算量过大

Method: 将大型最小二乘系统分解为分支网络和主干网络两个更小的子问题分别求解，并推广到包含正则化项的L2损失函数，包括物理信息无监督学习

Result: 该方法能够高效处理原本计算量过大的线性系统，使DeepONet训练加速

Conclusion: 提出的混合优化方法有效解决了DeepONet训练中的计算瓶颈问题，为物理信息无监督学习等应用提供了可行的解决方案

Abstract: We propose an efficient hybrid least squares/gradient descent method to
accelerate DeepONet training. Since the output of DeepONet can be viewed as
linear with respect to the last layer parameters of the branch network, these
parameters can be optimized using a least squares (LS) solve, and the remaining
hidden layer parameters are updated by means of gradient descent form. However,
building the LS system for all possible combinations of branch and trunk inputs
yields a prohibitively large linear problem that is infeasible to solve
directly. To address this issue, our method decomposes the large LS system into
two smaller, more manageable subproblems $\unicode{x2014}$ one for the branch
network and one for the trunk network $\unicode{x2014}$ and solves them
separately. This method is generalized to a broader type of $L^2$ loss with a
regularization term for the last layer parameters, including the case of
unsupervised learning with physics-informed loss.

Result: 在三个HAR场景中分别实现了3.73%、17.38%和3.70%的准确率提升，部署在RISC-V GAP9微控制器上

Conclusion: 证明了在嵌入式平台上实现快速、轻量且有效的个性化是可行的，为可扩展的用户感知HAR系统铺平了道路

Abstract: Human Activity Recognition (HAR) using wearable devices has advanced
significantly in recent years, yet its generalization remains limited when
models are deployed to new users. This degradation in performance is primarily
due to user-induced concept drift (UICD), highlighting the importance of
efficient personalization. In this paper, we present a hybrid framework that
first generalizes across users and then rapidly adapts to individual users
using few-shot learning directly on-device. By updating only the classifier
layer with user-specific data, our method achieves robust personalization with
minimal computational and memory overhead. We implement this framework on the
energy-efficient RISC-V-based GAP9 microcontroller and validate it across three
diverse HAR scenarios: RecGym, QVAR-Gesture, and Ultrasound-Gesture.
Post-deployment adaptation yields consistent accuracy improvements of 3.73\%,
17.38\%, and 3.70\% respectively. These results confirm that fast, lightweight,
and effective personalization is feasible on embedded platforms, paving the way
for scalable and user-aware HAR systems in the wild

TL;DR: 提出一种新的多元高斯聚类重叠检测方法，专门用于数据流在线学习中的聚类合并，比现有方法更快速且能够准确检测重叠聚类。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在数据流在线学习中，聚类模型需要随时间适应概念漫游，会产生大量可能重叠的聚类，需要合并。现有的分布异近性测量方法无法处理所有形状的聚类且计算成本高。

Method: 设计了一种专门用于检测重叠而非异近性的异近性测量方法，该方法计算更快速。方法能够检测重叠聚类同时避免合并正交聚类。

Result: 新方法比对照方法快几倍，能够有效检测重叠聚类。

Conclusion: 该研究提出的重叠检测测量方法适用于数据流在线学习场景，具有高效率和准确性优势。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a new measure for detecting overlap in multivariate
Gaussian clusters. The aim of online learning from data streams is to create
clustering, classification, or regression models that can adapt over time based
on the conceptual drift of streaming data. In the case of clustering, this can
result in a large number of clusters that may overlap and should be merged.
Commonly used distribution dissimilarity measures are not adequate for
determining overlapping clusters in the context of online learning from
streaming data due to their inability to account for all shapes of clusters and
their high computational demands. Our proposed dissimilarity measure is
specifically designed to detect overlap rather than dissimilarity and can be
computed faster compared to existing measures. Our method is several times
faster than compared methods and is capable of detecting overlapping clusters
while avoiding the merging of orthogonal clusters.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有机器遗忘方法仅通过参数训练抑制不良数据的激活，无法完全消除模型内部的信息痕迹，难以实现有效的持续遗忘且易受重新学习攻击

Method: 在特定网络层的隐藏状态空间实施投影变换，利用不可逆投影特性彻底消除有害信息，同时保留有用知识

Result: 实验结果表明该方法能够实现有效的持续遗忘，成功防御重新学习攻击，在遗忘效果和保持自然性能方面达到最先进水平

Conclusion: MRP方法通过不可逆投影变换从根本上解决了机器遗忘中的信息残留问题，为模型安全提供了更可靠的解决方案

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance
in various domains and tasks, concerns about their safety are becoming
increasingly severe. In particular, since models may store unsafe knowledge
internally, machine unlearning has emerged as a representative paradigm to
ensure model safety. Existing approaches employ various training techniques,
such as gradient ascent and negative preference optimization, in attempts to
eliminate the influence of undesired data on target models. However, these
methods merely suppress the activation of undesired data through parametric
training without completely eradicating its informational traces within the
model. This fundamental limitation makes it difficult to achieve effective
continuous unlearning, rendering these methods vulnerable to relearning
attacks. To overcome these challenges, we propose a Metamorphosis
Representation Projection (MRP) approach that pioneers the application of
irreversible projection properties to machine unlearning. By implementing
projective transformations in the hidden state space of specific network
layers, our method effectively eliminates harmful information while preserving
useful knowledge. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach enables
effective continuous unlearning and successfully defends against relearning
attacks, achieving state-of-the-art performance in unlearning effectiveness
while preserving natural performance. Our code is available in

Motivation: 现有神经网络局部鲁棒性验证器分析时间长或精度损失大，难以有效处理大量输入

Method: 动态构建和验证具有相似网络计算的ε-ball小批量，自适应确定批次大小，联合验证

Result: 在MNIST和CIFAR-10的全连接和卷积网络上，平均提速2.3倍，最高4.1倍，将24小时分析时间缩短至6小时

Conclusion: BaVerLy通过分组验证策略有效提升了局部鲁棒性验证的效率，为大规模输入验证提供了可行方案

Abstract: Neural network image classifiers are ubiquitous in many safety-critical
applications. However, they are susceptible to adversarial attacks. To
understand their robustness to attacks, many local robustness verifiers have
been proposed to analyze $\epsilon$-balls of inputs. Yet, existing verifiers
introduce a long analysis time or lose too much precision, making them less
effective for a large set of inputs. In this work, we propose a new approach to
local robustness: group local robustness verification. The key idea is to
leverage the similarity of the network computations of certain $\epsilon$-balls
to reduce the overall analysis time. We propose BaVerLy, a sound and complete
verifier that boosts the local robustness verification of a set of
$\epsilon$-balls by dynamically constructing and verifying mini-batches.
BaVerLy adaptively identifies successful mini-batch sizes, accordingly
constructs mini-batches of $\epsilon$-balls that have similar network
computations, and verifies them jointly. If a mini-batch is verified, all
$\epsilon$-balls are proven robust. Otherwise, one $\epsilon$-ball is suspected
as not being robust, guiding the refinement. In the latter case, BaVerLy
leverages the analysis results to expedite the analysis of that $\epsilon$-ball
as well as the other $\epsilon$-balls in the batch. We evaluate BaVerLy on
fully connected and convolutional networks for MNIST and CIFAR-10. Results show
that BaVerLy scales the common one by one verification by 2.3x on average and
up to 4.1x, in which case it reduces the total analysis time from 24 hours to 6
hours.

TL;DR: HypSeek是一个双曲表示学习框架，将配体、蛋白质口袋和序列嵌入到洛伦兹模型双曲空间中，统一了虚拟筛选和亲和力排序任务，显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于检索的方法在欧几里得空间中嵌入配体和蛋白质口袋进行相似性搜索，但欧几里得几何无法有效捕捉分子相互作用的层次结构和细粒度亲和力变化，特别是在活性悬崖等挑战性案例中。

Method: 提出HypSeek框架，利用双曲空间的指数几何和负曲率特性，采用蛋白质引导的三塔架构，在洛伦兹模型双曲空间中生成表达力强、对亲和力敏感的嵌入表示。

Result: 在DUD-E数据集上虚拟筛选的早期富集率从42.63%提升到51.44%（+20.7%），在JACS数据集上亲和力排序相关性从0.5774提升到0.7239（+25.4%）。

Conclusion: 双曲几何为蛋白质-配体建模提供了强大的归纳偏置，在两个任务中都展现出显著优势，证明了其在分子相互作用建模中的潜力。

Abstract: Protein-ligand binding prediction is central to virtual screening and
affinity ranking, two fundamental tasks in drug discovery. While recent
retrieval-based methods embed ligands and protein pockets into Euclidean space
for similarity-based search, the geometry of Euclidean embeddings often fails
to capture the hierarchical structure and fine-grained affinity variations
intrinsic to molecular interactions. In this work, we propose HypSeek, a
hyperbolic representation learning framework that embeds ligands, protein
pockets, and sequences into Lorentz-model hyperbolic space. By leveraging the
exponential geometry and negative curvature of hyperbolic space, HypSeek
enables expressive, affinity-sensitive embeddings that can effectively model
both global activity and subtle functional differences-particularly in
challenging cases such as activity cliffs, where structurally similar ligands
exhibit large affinity gaps. Our mode unifies virtual screening and affinity
ranking in a single framework, introducing a protein-guided three-tower
architecture to enhance representational structure. HypSeek improves early
enrichment in virtual screening on DUD-E from 42.63 to 51.44 (+20.7%) and
affinity ranking correlation on JACS from 0.5774 to 0.7239 (+25.4%),
demonstrating the benefits of hyperbolic geometry across both tasks and
highlighting its potential as a powerful inductive bias for protein-ligand
modeling.

Result: 大量实验结果表明该方法在各种基于图的公平性任务中具有有效性和通用性

Conclusion: 通过优化伪任务中的公平性可以有效增强结构公平性，促进不同下游应用的公平性泛化

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved remarkable success across diverse
applications. However, due to the biases in the graph structures, graph neural
networks face significant challenges in fairness. Although the original user
graph structure is generally biased, it is promising to guide these existing
structures toward unbiased ones by introducing new links. The fairness guidance
via new links could foster unbiased communities, thereby enhancing fairness in
downstream applications. To address this issue, we propose a novel framework
named FairGuide. Specifically, to ensure fairness in downstream tasks trained
on fairness-guided graphs, we introduce a differentiable community detection
task as a pseudo downstream task. Our theoretical analysis further demonstrates
that optimizing fairness within this pseudo task effectively enhances
structural fairness, promoting fairness generalization across diverse
downstream applications. Moreover, FairGuide employs an effective strategy
which leverages meta-gradients derived from the fairness-guidance objective to
identify new links that significantly enhance structural fairness. Extensive
experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and generalizability of our
proposed method across a variety of graph-based fairness tasks.

Motivation: 解决多用户本地差分隐私环境中梯度注入噪声方法（如DP-SGD）的计算效率低和稳定性差的问题

Method: 通过扰动稳定化的泰勒展开多项式逼近模型的训练损失函数，为用户数据添加校准噪声到多项式系数中，而不是向梯度注入噪声

Result: 在无线体域网场景中，SPOF比DP-SGD平均重建准确率提高3.5%，训练时间减少57.2%，表现出更好的隐私-效用权衡

Conclusion: SPOF在多用户环境中提供更优越的隐私保护性能，具有更好的计算效率和环境噪声鲁棒性

Abstract: We propose SPOF (Stabilization of Perturbed Loss Function), a differentially
private training mechanism intended for multi-user local differential privacy
(LDP). SPOF perturbs a stabilized Taylor expanded polynomial approximation of a
model's training loss function, where each user's data is privatized by
calibrated noise added to the coefficients of the polynomial. Unlike
gradient-based mechanisms such as differentially private stochastic gradient
descent (DP-SGD), SPOF does not require injecting noise into the gradients of
the loss function, which improves both computational efficiency and stability.
This formulation naturally supports simultaneous privacy guarantees across all
users. Moreover, SPOF exhibits robustness to environmental noise during
training, maintaining stable performance even when user inputs are corrupted.
We compare SPOF with a multi-user extension of DP-SGD, evaluating both methods
in a wireless body area network (WBAN) scenario involving heterogeneous user
data and stochastic channel noise from body sensors. Our results show that SPOF
achieves, on average, up to 3.5% higher reconstruction accuracy and reduces
mean training time by up to 57.2% compared to DP-SGD, demonstrating superior
privacy-utility trade-offs in multi-user environments.

Abstract: This study presents a practical approach for early fault detection in
industrial pump systems using real-world sensor data from a large-scale
vertical centrifugal pump operating in a demanding marine environment. Five key
operational parameters were monitored: vibration, temperature, flow rate,
pressure, and electrical current. A dual-threshold labeling method was applied,
combining fixed engineering limits with adaptive thresholds calculated as the
95th percentile of historical sensor values. To address the rarity of
documented failures, synthetic fault signals were injected into the data using
domain-specific rules, simulating critical alerts within plausible operating
ranges. Three machine learning classifiers - Random Forest, Extreme Gradient
Boosting (XGBoost), and Support Vector Machine (SVM) - were trained to
distinguish between normal operation, early warnings, and critical alerts.
Results showed that Random Forest and XGBoost models achieved high accuracy
across all classes, including minority cases representing rare or emerging
faults, while the SVM model exhibited lower sensitivity to anomalies. Visual
analyses, including grouped confusion matrices and time-series plots, indicated
that the proposed hybrid method provides robust detection capabilities. The
framework is scalable, interpretable, and suitable for real-time industrial
deployment, supporting proactive maintenance decisions before failures occur.
Furthermore, it can be adapted to other machinery with similar sensor
architectures, highlighting its potential as a scalable solution for predictive
maintenance in complex systems.

Abstract: Understanding the nuanced performance of machine learning models is essential
for responsible deployment, especially in high-stakes domains like healthcare
and finance. This paper introduces a novel framework, Conformalized Exceptional
Model Mining, which combines the rigor of Conformal Prediction with the
explanatory power of Exceptional Model Mining (EMM). The proposed framework
identifies cohesive subgroups within data where model performance deviates
exceptionally, highlighting regions of both high confidence and high
uncertainty. We develop a new model class, mSMoPE (multiplex Soft Model
Performance Evaluation), which quantifies uncertainty through conformal
prediction's rigorous coverage guarantees. By defining a new quality measure,
Relative Average Uncertainty Loss (RAUL), our framework isolates subgroups with
exceptional performance patterns in multi-class classification and regression
tasks. Experimental results across diverse datasets demonstrate the framework's
effectiveness in uncovering interpretable subgroups that provide critical
insights into model behavior. This work lays the groundwork for enhancing model
interpretability and reliability, advancing the state-of-the-art in explainable
AI and uncertainty quantification.

*Ortal Senouf,Antoine Wehenkel,Cédric Vincent-Cuaz,Emmanuel Abbé,Pascal Frossard*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出一种循环次序化的模型缺失处理方法，通过小批量最优运输和条件正规化流实现端到端的归纳性SBI框架，解决了RoPE方法在推理时需要批量测试样本的限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决模型缺失问题，即模拟与真实观测之间的不匹配。RoPE方法虽然通过半监督检验和最优运输对齐解决了模型缺失，但在推理时需要批量测试样本，影响了扩展性和通用性。

Method: 将检验和分布对齐集成到一个端到端可训练模型中。使用小批量最优运输和闭式耦合对齐相同潜参数的真实与模拟观测，利用配对的检验数据和未配对样本。然后训练条件正规化流来近似最优运输导致的后验分布。

Result: 在合成和真实世界标准测试中（包括复杂医疗生物标记估计），方法表现等同或超过RoPE以及其他标准SBI和非SBI估计器。

Conclusion: 该方法在保持高性能的同时，提供了更好的扩展性和在具有挑战性的模型缺失环境中的应用能力。

Abstract: Simulation-based inference (SBI) is a statistical inference approach for
estimating latent parameters of a physical system when the likelihood is
intractable but simulations are available. In practice, SBI is often hindered
by model misspecification--the mismatch between simulated and real-world
observations caused by inherent modeling simplifications. RoPE, a recent SBI
approach, addresses this challenge through a two-stage domain transfer process
that combines semi-supervised calibration with optimal transport (OT)-based
distribution alignment. However, RoPE operates in a fully transductive setting,
requiring access to a batch of test samples at inference time, which limits
scalability and generalization. We propose here a fully inductive and amortized
SBI framework that integrates calibration and distributional alignment into a
single, end-to-end trainable model. Our method leverages mini-batch OT with a
closed-form coupling to align real and simulated observations that correspond
to the same latent parameters, using both paired calibration data and unpaired
samples. A conditional normalizing flow is then trained to approximate the
OT-induced posterior, enabling efficient inference without simulation access at
test time. Across a range of synthetic and real-world benchmarks--including
complex medical biomarker estimation--our approach matches or surpasses the
performance of RoPE, as well as other standard SBI and non-SBI estimators,
while offering improved scalability and applicability in challenging,
misspecified environments.

TL;DR: 提出了Continual Neural Topic Model (CoNTM)，用于持续学习新任务而不遗忘先前学到的主题，通过持续更新的全局先验分布实现，在主题质量和预测困惑度方面优于动态主题模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有动态主题模型需要一次性处理整个训练语料，而在线主题模型缺乏长期记忆能力，需要一种能够持续学习新主题而不遗忘先前知识的模型。

Method: 使用全局先验分布持续更新的方法，构建Continual Neural Topic Model (CoNTM)，实现在后续时间步连续学习主题模型。

Result: CoNTM在主题质量和预测困惑度方面一致优于动态主题模型，能够在线捕捉主题变化，学习更多样化的主题并更好地捕捉时间变化。

Conclusion: CoNTM成功填补了现有方法的空白，实现了持续学习而不遗忘的目标，在主题建模的持续学习任务中表现出色。

Abstract: In continual learning, our aim is to learn a new task without forgetting what
was learned previously. In topic models, this translates to learning new topic
models without forgetting previously learned topics. Previous work either
considered Dynamic Topic Models (DTMs), which learn the evolution of topics
based on the entire training corpus at once, or Online Topic Models, which are
updated continuously based on new data but do not have long-term memory. To
fill this gap, we propose the Continual Neural Topic Model (CoNTM), which
continuously learns topic models at subsequent time steps without forgetting
what was previously learned. This is achieved using a global prior distribution
that is continuously updated. In our experiments, CoNTM consistently
outperformed the dynamic topic model in terms of topic quality and predictive
perplexity while being able to capture topic changes online. The analysis
reveals that CoNTM can learn more diverse topics and better capture temporal
changes than existing methods.

Conclusion: GRASPED通过频域编码解码架构有效解决了图异常检测中标注数据稀缺和多尺度信息利用的问题，为无监督图异常检测提供了新的有效方法

Abstract: Graph machine learning has been widely explored in various domains, such as
community detection, transaction analysis, and recommendation systems. In these
applications, anomaly detection plays an important role. Recently, studies have
shown that anomalies on graphs induce spectral shifts. Some supervised methods
have improved the utilization of such spectral domain information. However,
they remain limited by the scarcity of labeled data due to the nature of
anomalies. On the other hand, existing unsupervised learning approaches
predominantly rely on spatial information or only employ low-pass filters,
thereby losing the capacity for multi-band analysis. In this paper, we propose
Graph Autoencoder with Spectral Encoder and Spectral Decoder (GRASPED) for node
anomaly detection. Our unsupervised learning model features an encoder based on
Graph Wavelet Convolution, along with structural and attribute decoders. The
Graph Wavelet Convolution-based encoder, combined with a Wiener Graph
Deconvolution-based decoder, exhibits bandpass filter characteristics that
capture global and local graph information at multiple scales. This design
allows for a learning-based reconstruction of node attributes, effectively
capturing anomaly information. Extensive experiments on several real-world
graph anomaly detection datasets demonstrate that GRASPED outperforms current
state-of-the-art models.

Conclusion: 贝叶斯校准方法可以有效恢复无偏效应估计，但不是万能的解决方案，该问题适用于任何具有非零错误率的事件检测和分类器

Abstract: With the advent of wearable recorders, scientists are increasingly turning to
automated methods of analysis of audio and video data in order to measure
children's experience, behavior, and outcomes, with a sizable literature
employing long-form audio-recordings to study language acquisition. While
numerous articles report on the accuracy and reliability of the most popular
automated classifiers, less has been written on the downstream effects of
classification errors on measurements and statistical inferences (e.g., the
estimate of correlations and effect sizes in regressions). This paper proposes
a Bayesian approach to study the effects of algorithmic errors on key
scientific questions, including the effect of siblings on children's language
experience and the association between children's production and their input.
In both the most commonly used \gls{lena}, and an open-source alternative (the
Voice Type Classifier from the ACLEW system), we find that classification
errors can significantly distort estimates. For instance, automated annotations
underestimated the negative effect of siblings on adult input by 20--80\%,
potentially placing it below statistical significance thresholds. We further
show that a Bayesian calibration approach for recovering unbiased estimates of
effect sizes can be effective and insightful, but does not provide a fool-proof
solution. Both the issue reported and our solution may apply to any classifier
involving event detection and classification with non-zero error rates.

Motivation: 现有的机器学习公平性方法缺乏形式保证，而验证技术又无法在训练过程中主动提升公平性。需要一种能够在训练过程中持续保证个体公平性的方法。

Method: 设计了一个双部分框架：(1)可证公平的初始化，保证模型在公平状态下开始；(2)公平保持训练算法，在模型学习过程中维持公平性。关键技术是使用随机响应机制来保护敏感属性同时维持公平保证。

Result: 实验评估证明该方法有效，能够生成经验上公平且准确的模型。与基于认证训练的方法相比，该方法更加高效。

Conclusion: 该研究提供了一种能够在整个训练过程中形式保证个体公平性的方法，充实了现有公平性方法在理论保证方面的空白，为建立可靠的公平机器学习系统提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Fairness in machine learning is more important than ever as ethical concerns
continue to grow. Individual fairness demands that individuals differing only
in sensitive attributes receive the same outcomes. However, commonly used
machine learning algorithms often fail to achieve such fairness. To improve
individual fairness, various training methods have been developed, such as
incorporating fairness constraints as optimisation objectives. While these
methods have demonstrated empirical effectiveness, they lack formal guarantees
of fairness. Existing approaches that aim to provide fairness guarantees
primarily rely on verification techniques, which can sometimes fail to produce
definitive results. Moreover, verification alone does not actively enhance
individual fairness during training. To address this limitation, we propose a
novel framework that formally guarantees individual fairness throughout
training. Our approach consists of two parts, i.e., (1) provably fair
initialisation that ensures the model starts in a fair state, and (2) a
fairness-preserving training algorithm that maintains fairness as the model
learns. A key element of our method is the use of randomised response
mechanisms, which protect sensitive attributes while maintaining fairness
guarantees. We formally prove that this mechanism sustains individual fairness
throughout the training process. Experimental evaluations confirm that our
approach is effective, i.e., producing models that are empirically fair and
accurate. Furthermore, our approach is much more efficient than the alternative
approach based on certified training (which requires neural network
verification during training).

Motivation: 精准药物治疗需要准确的剂量反应预测，传统方法开发周期长且需要大量专家建模，需要一种能够快速适应新化合物并量化患者间变异性的方法

Method: 使用Transformer框架，基于Ornstein-Uhlenbeck先验在数十万个合成药代动力学轨迹上进行预训练，通过上下文贝叶斯推理生成后验预测

Conclusion: 基于Transformer的群体感知神经架构为定制药代动力学建模提供了新选择，为实现真正群体感知的个性化给药方案开辟了道路

Abstract: Accurate dose-response forecasting under sparse sampling is central to
precision pharmacotherapy. We present the Amortized In-Context Mixed-Effect
Transformer (AICMET) model, a transformer-based latent-variable framework that
unifies mechanistic compartmental priors with amortized in-context Bayesian
inference. AICMET is pre-trained on hundreds of thousands of synthetic
pharmacokinetic trajectories with Ornstein-Uhlenbeck priors over the parameters
of compartment models, endowing the model with strong inductive biases and
enabling zero-shot adaptation to new compounds. At inference time, the decoder
conditions on the collective context of previously profiled trial participants,
generating calibrated posterior predictions for newly enrolled patients after a
few early drug concentration measurements. This capability collapses
traditional model-development cycles from weeks to hours while preserving some
degree of expert modelling. Experiments across public datasets show that AICMET
attains state-of-the-art predictive accuracy and faithfully quantifies
inter-patient variability -- outperforming both nonlinear mixed-effects
baselines and recent neural ODE variants. Our results highlight the feasibility
of transformer-based, population-aware neural architectures as offering a new
alternative for bespoke pharmacokinetic modeling pipelines, charting a path
toward truly population-aware personalized dosing regimens.

Abstract: Effective modeling of heterogeneous subpopulations presents a significant
challenge due to variations in individual characteristics and behaviors. This
paper proposes a novel approach to address this issue through multi-task
learning (MTL) and low-rank tensor decomposition techniques. Our MTL approach
aims to enhance personalized modeling by leveraging shared structures among
similar tasks while accounting for distinct subpopulation-specific variations.
We introduce a framework where low-rank decomposition decomposes the collection
of task model parameters into a low-rank structure that captures commonalities
and variations across tasks and subpopulations. This approach allows for
efficient learning of personalized models by sharing knowledge between similar
tasks while preserving the unique characteristics of each subpopulation.
Experimental results in simulation and case study datasets demonstrate the
superior performance of the proposed method compared to several benchmarks,
particularly in scenarios with high variability among subpopulations. The
proposed framework not only improves prediction accuracy but also enhances
interpretability by revealing underlying patterns that contribute to the
personalization of models.

Motivation: 实际世界环境具有多段灵性和人类专家，但目前缺乏适合研究社会智能的开放式多段灵环境。需要一个能够模拟复杂目标和自利行为的环境来推动社会AI研究。

Method: 设计了一个多段灵环境，允许多个自利段灵进行复杂独立目标。在这个环境中研究社会学习对段灵性能的影响，包括在专家存在时的学习效果，以及涉及隐式合作、协作工具使用和长期限目标实现的行为。

Conclusion: 这个开放式多段灵环境为研究社会AI提供了重要平台，能够促进AI模型在复杂环境中学习适应性行为和社会智能，为实际部署奠定基础。

Abstract: Many challenges remain before AI agents can be deployed in real-world
environments. However, one virtue of such environments is that they are
inherently multi-agent and contain human experts. Using advanced social
intelligence in such an environment can help an AI agent learn adaptive skills
and behaviors that a known expert exhibits. While social intelligence could
accelerate training, it is currently difficult to study due to the lack of
open-ended multi-agent environments. In this work, we present an environment in
which multiple self-interested agents can pursue complex and independent goals,
reflective of real world challenges. This environment will enable research into
the development of socially intelligent AI agents in open-ended multi-agent
settings, where agents may be implicitly incentivized to cooperate to defeat
common enemies, build and share tools, and achieve long horizon goals. In this
work, we investigate the impact on agent performance due to social learning in
the presence of experts and implicit cooperation such as emergent collaborative
tool use, and whether agents can benefit from either cooperation or competition
in this environment.

Abstract: We present several advances to the physics and equality constrained
artificial neural networks (PECANN) framework that substantially improve its
capability to learn solutions of canonical partial differential equations
(PDEs). First, we generalize the augmented Lagrangian method (ALM) to support
multiple independent penalty parameters, enabling simultaneous enforcement of
heterogeneous constraints. Second, we reformulate pointwise constraint
enforcement and Lagrange multipliers as expectations over constraint terms,
reducing memory overhead and permitting efficient mini-batch training. Third,
to address PDEs with oscillatory, multi-scale features, we incorporate Fourier
feature mappings and show that a single mapping suffices where multiple
mappings or more costly architectures were required in related methods. Fourth,
we introduce a time-windowing strategy for long-time evolution in which the
terminal state of each window is enforced as an initial-condition constraint
for the next, ensuring continuity without discrete time models. Crucially, we
propose a conditionally adaptive penalty update (CAPU) strategy for ALM, which
preserves the principle that larger constraint violations incur stronger
penalties. CAPU accelerates the growth of Lagrange multipliers for selectively
challenging constraints, enhancing constraint enforcement during training. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of PECANN-CAPU on problems including the
transonic rarefaction problem, reversible advection of a passive by a vortex,
high-wavenumber Helmholtz and Poisson equations, and inverse identification of
spatially varying heat sources. Comparisons with established methods and recent
Kolmogorov-Arnold network approaches show that PECANN-CAPU achieves competitive
accuracy across all cases. Collectively, these advances improve PECANN's
robustness, efficiency, and applicability to demanding problems in scientific
computing.

Method: 提出了一种新的混合采样方法，结合了经典MCMC和D-Wave量子逆灰器的采样特点，并将其应用于RBM训练和减缓坏失恐恐的生成式重现方案。

Result: 混合采样方法在RBM训练中未能实现显著改善，但量子采样在生成多样化的低概率模式方面显示优势，在减缓坏失恐恐方面取得了与经典方法相当的效果。

Conclusion: 量子逆灰器与MCMC在分布概率中低区域的差异不足以改善RBM训练，但量子采样在生成多样化模式的速度和潜力使其在减缓坏失恐恐等具有挑战性的机器学习应用中前景广阔。

Abstract: Modest statistical differences between the sampling performances of the
D-Wave quantum annealer (QA) and the classical Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC),
when applied to Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs), are explored to explain,
and possibly address, the absence of significant and consistent improvements in
RBM trainability when the D-Wave sampling was used in previous investigations.
A novel hybrid sampling approach, combining the classical and the QA
contributions, is investigated as a promising way to benefit from the modest
differences between the two sampling methods. No improvements in the RBM
training are achieved in this work, thereby suggesting that the differences
between the QA-based and MCMC sampling, mainly found in the medium-to-low
probability regions of the distribution, which are less important for the
quality of the sample, are insufficient to benefit the training. Difficulties
in achieving sufficiently high quality of embedding RBMs into the lattice of
the newer generation of D-Wave hardware could be further complicating the task.
On the other hand, the ability to generate samples of sufficient variety from
lower-probability parts of the distribution has a potential to benefit other
machine learning applications, such as the mitigation of catastrophic
forgetting (CF) during incremental learning. The feasibility of using
QA-generated patterns of desirable classes for CF mitigation by the generative
replay is demonstrated in this work for the first time. While the efficiency of
the CF mitigation using the D-Wave QA was comparable to that of the classical
mitigation, both the speed of generating a large number of distinct desirable
patterns and the potential for further improvement make this approach promising
for a variety of challenging machine learning applications.

Conclusion: SparseLoCo通过创新的稀疏化和量化技术成功解决了大语言模型分布式训练中的通信瓶颈问题，在保持甚至提升模型性能的同时大幅降低了通信开销。

Abstract: Communication-efficient distributed training algorithms have received
considerable interest recently due to their benefits for training Large
Language Models (LLMs) in bandwidth-constrained settings, such as across data
centers and over the internet. Despite reducing communication frequency, these
methods still typically require communicating a full copy of the model's
gradients-resulting in a communication bottleneck even for cross-datacenter
links. Furthermore, they can slightly degrade performance compared to a naive
AdamW DDP baseline. While quantization and error feedback are often applied to
reduce the pseudo-gradient's size, in the context of LLM pre-training, existing
approaches have been unable to additionally leverage sparsification and have
obtained limited quantization. In this work, we introduce SparseLoCo, a
communication-efficient training algorithm for LLMs that effectively leverages
Top-k sparsification and quantization to reach extreme compression ratios of up
to 1-3% sparsity and 2-bit quantization while outperforming full-precision
DiLoCo. Our key observations are that outer momentum can be locally
approximated by an error feedback combined with aggressive sparsity and that
sparse aggregation can actually improve model performance. We empirically
demonstrate in a range of communication-constrained LLM training settings that
SparseLoCo provides significant benefits in both performance and communication
cost.

Abstract: Extracting meaning from uncertain, noisy data is a fundamental problem across
time series analysis, pattern recognition, and language modeling. This survey
presents a unified mathematical framework that connects classical estimation
theory, statistical inference, and modern machine learning, including deep
learning and large language models. By analyzing how techniques such as maximum
likelihood estimation, Bayesian inference, and attention mechanisms address
uncertainty, the paper illustrates that many AI methods are rooted in shared
probabilistic principles. Through illustrative scenarios including system
identification, image classification, and language generation, we show how
increasingly complex models build upon these foundations to tackle practical
challenges like overfitting, data sparsity, and interpretability. In other
words, the work demonstrates that maximum likelihood, MAP estimation, Bayesian
classification, and deep learning all represent different facets of a shared
goal: inferring hidden causes from noisy and/or biased observations. It serves
as both a theoretical synthesis and a practical guide for students and
researchers navigating the evolving landscape of machine learning.

<details>

Motivation: 尽管AI快速发展，安全性仍是机器学习系统部署的主要瓶颈。OOD检测是关键安全组件，但之前研究发现基于似然的方法在实践中经常失败，需要探究这是密度估计能力问题还是像素空间限制。

Method: 训练变分扩散模型在预训练ResNet-18的表示空间上（而非图像像素空间），使用基于似然的OOD检测器，并与OpenOOD套件中的最先进方法进行比较评估。

Result: 研究表明在理论上，假设OOD数据均匀分布时，似然是最优的OOD检测器。但需要验证在表示空间中是否能够克服像素空间的限制。

Conclusion: 通过将生成模型应用于表示空间而非像素空间，可以更好地评估基于似然的OOD检测方法的实际性能，为解决OOD检测问题提供新视角。

Abstract: Despite rapid advances in AI, safety remains the main bottleneck to deploying
machine-learning systems. A critical safety component is out-of-distribution
detection: given an input, decide whether it comes from the same distribution
as the training data. In generative models, the most natural OOD score is the
data likelihood. Actually, under the assumption of uniformly distributed OOD
data, the likelihood is even the optimal OOD detector, as we show in this work.
However, earlier work reported that likelihood often fails in practice, raising
doubts about its usefulness. We explore whether, in practice, the
representation space also suffers from the inability to learn good density
estimation for OOD detection, or if it is merely a problem of the pixel space
typically used in generative models. To test this, we trained a Variational
Diffusion Model not on images, but on the representation space of a pre-trained
ResNet-18 to assess the performance of our likelihood-based detector in
comparison to state-of-the-art methods from the OpenOOD suite.

Abstract: In recent years, a plethora of open-source foundation models have emerged,
achieving remarkable progress in some widely attended fields, with performance
being quite close to that of closed-source models. However, in high-value but
more challenging scientific professional fields, either the fields still rely
on expert models, or the progress of general foundation models lags
significantly compared to those in popular areas, far from sufficient for
transforming scientific research and leaving substantial gap between
open-source models and closed-source models in these scientific domains. To
mitigate this gap and explore a step further toward Artificial General
Intelligence (AGI), we introduce Intern-S1, a specialized generalist equipped
with general understanding and reasoning capabilities with expertise to analyze
multiple science modal data. Intern-S1 is a multimodal Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)
model with 28 billion activated parameters and 241 billion total parameters,
continually pre-trained on 5T tokens, including over 2.5T tokens from
scientific domains. In the post-training stage, Intern-S1 undergoes offline and
then online reinforcement learning (RL) in InternBootCamp, where we propose
Mixture-of-Rewards (MoR) to synergize the RL training on more than 1000 tasks
simultaneously. Through integrated innovations in algorithms, data, and
training systems, Intern-S1 achieved top-tier performance in online RL
training.On comprehensive evaluation benchmarks, Intern-S1 demonstrates
competitive performance on general reasoning tasks among open-source models and
significantly outperforms open-source models in scientific domains, surpassing
closed-source state-of-the-art models in professional tasks, such as molecular
synthesis planning, reaction condition prediction, predicting thermodynamic
stabilities for crystals. Our models are available at

Abstract: We address the problem of detecting adversarial attacks against cooperative
multi-agent reinforcement learning with continuous action space. We propose a
decentralized detector that relies solely on the local observations of the
agents and makes use of a statistical characterization of the normal behavior
of observable agents. The proposed detector utilizes deep neural networks to
approximate the normal behavior of agents as parametric multivariate Gaussian
distributions. Based on the predicted density functions, we define a normality
score and provide a characterization of its mean and variance. This
characterization allows us to employ a two-sided CUSUM procedure for detecting
deviations of the normality score from its mean, serving as a detector of
anomalous behavior in real-time. We evaluate our scheme on various multi-agent
PettingZoo benchmarks against different state-of-the-art attack methods, and
our results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in detecting impactful
adversarial attacks. Particularly, it outperforms the discrete counterpart by
achieving AUC-ROC scores of over 0.95 against the most impactful attacks in all
evaluated environments.

Abstract: Recent efforts have extended the capabilities of transformers in logical
reasoning and symbolic computations. In this work, we investigate their
capacity for non-linear latent pattern discovery in the context of functional
decomposition, focusing on the challenging algebraic task of multivariate
polynomial decomposition. This problem, with widespread applications in science
and engineering, is proved to be NP-hard, and demands both precision and
insight. Our contributions are threefold: First, we develop a synthetic data
generation pipeline providing fine-grained control over problem complexity.
Second, we train transformer models via supervised learning and evaluate them
across four key dimensions involving scaling behavior and generalizability.
Third, we propose Beam Grouped Relative Policy Optimization (BGRPO), a
rank-aware reinforcement learning method suitable for hard algebraic problems.
Finetuning with BGRPO improves accuracy while reducing beam width by up to
half, resulting in approximately 75% lower inference compute. Additionally, our
model demonstrates competitive performance in polynomial simplification,
outperforming Mathematica in various cases.
