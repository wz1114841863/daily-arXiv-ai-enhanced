Existing test strategies, including histogram-based approaches, sine wave testing, and model-driven reconstruction, often rely on dense data acquisition followed by offline post-processing, which increases overall test time and complexity. To overcome these limitations, we propose an adaptive approach that utilizes an iterative behavioral model refined by an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) in real time, enabling direct estimation of capacitor mismatch parameters that determine INL behavior. Our algorithm dynamically selects measurement points based on current model uncertainty, maximizing information gain with respect to parameter confidence and narrowing sampling intervals as estimation progresses. By providing immediate feedback and adaptive targeting, the proposed method eliminates the need for large-scale data collection and post-measurement analysis. Experimental results demonstrate substantial reductions in total test time and computational overhead, highlighting the method's suitability for integration in production environments."}

UGLMS is a closed-loop test strategy that adaptively selects SAR ADC code edges based on model uncertainty and refines a behavioral mismatch model in real time via an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF), eliminating full-range sweeps and offline post-processing. We introduce an enhanced UGLMS that delivers significantly faster test runtimes while maintaining estimation accuracy. First, a rank-1 EKF update replaces costly matrix inversions with efficient vector operations, and a measurement-aligned covariance-inflation strategy accelerates convergence under unexpected innovations. Second, we extend the static mismatch model with a low-order carrier polynomial to capture systematic nonlinearities beyond pure capacitor mismatch. Third, a trace-based termination adapts test length to convergence, preventing premature stops and redundant iterations. Simulations show the enhanced UGLMS reconstructs full Integral- and Differential-Non-Linearity (INL/DNL) in just 36 ms for 16-bit and under 70 ms for 18-bit ADCs (120 ms with the polynomial extension). Combining the faster convergence from covariance inflation with reduced per-iteration runtime from the rank-1 EKF update, the method reaches equal accuracy 8x faster for 16-bit ADCs. These improvements enable real-time, production-ready SAR ADC linearity testing."}

Existing video generation models are predominantly based on the video diffusion transformer (vDiT), however, they suffer from substantial inference delay due to self-attention. While prior studies have focused on reducing redundant computations in self-attention, they often overlook the inherent spatio-temporal correlations in video streams and directly leverage sparsity patterns from large language models to reduce attention computations.\n  In this work, we take a principled approach to accelerate self-attention in vDiTs by leveraging the spatio-temporal correlations in the latent space. We show that the attention patterns within vDiT are primarily due to the dominant spatial and temporal correlations at the token channel level. Based on this insight, we propose a lightweight and adaptive reuse strategy that approximates attention computations by reusing partial attention scores of spatially or temporally correlated tokens along individual channels. We demonstrate that our method achieves significantly higher computational savings (85\\%) compared to state-of-the-art techniques over 4 vDiTs, while preserving almost identical video quality ($<$0.06\\% loss on VBench)."}

Moreover, the involved binomial matrix multiplication operation is decomposed into 4 groups of bit-serial shifting and additions, without costly physical multipliers in the CIM. We maximize the energy efficiency of the CIM circuit through zero-value bit-skipping, data-driven word line activation, read-write separate 6T cells and bit-alternating 14T/28T adders. The proposed CIM macro was implemented using a 65-nm process. It occupied only 0.35 mm2 area, and delivered a 42.27 GOPS peak performance with 1.24 mW power consumption at a 1.0 V power supply and a 100 MHz clock frequency, resulting in 34.1 TOPS/W energy efficiency and 120.77 GOPS/mm2 area efficiency.

Inference, particularly the decoding phase, is dominated by memory-bound GEMV or flat GEMM operations with low operational intensity (OI), making it well-suited for processing-in-memory (PIM) approaches. However, existing in/near-memory solutions face critical limitations such as reduced memory capacity due to the high area cost of integrating processing elements (PEs) within DRAM chips, and limited PE capability due to the constraints of DRAM fabrication technology. This work presents a chiplet-based memory module that addresses these limitations by decoupling logic and memory into chiplets fabricated in heterogeneous technology nodes and connected via an interposer. The logic chiplets sustain high bandwidth access to the DRAM chiplets, which house the memory banks, and enable the integration of advanced processing components such as systolic arrays and SRAM-based buffers to accelerate memory-bound GEMM kernels, capabilities that were not feasible in prior PIM architectures. We propose Sangam, a CXL-attached PIM-chiplet based memory module that can either act as a drop-in replacement for GPUs or co-executes along side the GPUs.

We show how to use them to solve Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) explicitly discretized on a computational stencil. From this point of view, the QPU serves as a sampling accelerator. Each micro-kernel consumes only stencil inputs (neighbor values and coefficients), runs a shallow parameterized circuit, and reports the sample mean of a readout rule. The resource footprint in qubits and depth is fixed and independent of the global grid. This makes micro-kernels easy to orchestrate from a classical host and to parallelize across grid points. We present two realizations. The Bernoulli micro-kernel targets convex-sum stencils by encoding values as single-qubit probabilities with shot allocation proportional to stencil weights. The branching micro-kernel prepares a selector over stencil branches and applies addressed rotations to a single readout qubit. In contrast to monolithic quantum PDE solvers that encode the full space-time problem in one deep circuit, our approach keeps the classical time loop and offloads only local updates. Batching and in-circuit fusion amortize submission and readout overheads. We test and validate the QPU micro-kernel method on two PDEs commonly arising in scientific computing: the Heat and viscous Burgers' equations. On noiseless quantum circuit simulators, accuracy improves as the number of samples increases. On the IBM Brisbane quantum computer, single-step diffusion tests show lower errors for the Bernoulli realization than for branching at equal shot budgets, with QPU micro-kernel execution dominating the wall time."}

Knowledge Distillation (KD) where a LLM \"teacher\" trains a smaller and more efficient \"student\" model, offers a promising solution to this problem. However, the distillation process itself often remains costly for large datasets, since it requires the teacher to label a vast number of samples while incurring significant token consumption. To alleviate this challenge, in this work we explore the active learning (AL) as a way to create efficient student models at a fraction of the cost while preserving the LLM's performance. In particular, we introduce M-RARU (Multi-class Randomized Accept/Reject Uncertainty Sampling), a novel AL algorithm that significantly reduces training costs. M-RARU employs an innovative strategy combining uncertainty with a randomized accept-reject mechanism to select only the most informative data points for the LLM teacher. This focused approach significantly minimizes required API calls and data processing time. We evaluate M-RARU against random sampling across five diverse student models (SVM, LDA, RF, GBDT, and DistilBERT) on multiple benchmark datasets. Experiments demonstrate that our proposed method achieves up to 80% reduction in sample requirements as compared to random sampling, substantially improving classification accuracy while reducing financial costs and overall training time."}

As a result, high-end processors typically feature lower memory bandwidth per core, at the detriment of memory-intensive workloads. We propose alleviating this challenge by improving the utility of the CPU's limited pins. In a typical CPU design process, the available pins are apportioned between memory and I/O traffic, each accounting for about half of the total off-chip bandwidth availability. Consequently, unless both memory and I/O are simultaneously highly utilized, such fragmentation leads to underutilization of the valuable off-chip bandwidth resources. An ideal architecture would offer I/O and memory bandwidth fungibility, allowing use of the aggregate off-chip bandwidth in the form required by each workload.\n  In this work, we introduce SURGE, a software-supported architectural technique that boosts memory bandwidth availability by salvaging idle I/O bandwidth resources. SURGE leverages the capability of versatile interconnect technologies like CXL to dynamically multiplex memory and I/O traffic over the same processor interface.

In view of this, we propose Segmented Exponent Alignment (SEA) and Dynamic Wordline Activation (DWA) strategies. SEA exploits the observation that input exponents are often clustered around zero or within a narrow range. By segmenting the exponent space and aligning mantissas accordingly, SEA eliminates the need for maximum exponent detection and reduces input mantissa shifting, and thus reduces the processing latency. DWA further reduces latency and maintains accuracy by activating wordlines based on the exponent segments defined by SEA.

We implemented citation tracing to reduce hallucinations and improve user trust, and evaluated alternative retrieval and generation configurations to identify effective design choices. The end-to-end pipeline is built entirely with open-source tools, enabling easy adaptation to other domains requiring document-grounded question answering. This work highlights design considerations, practical challenges, and lessons learned in deploying trustworthy RAG systems for governance-related contexts."}

This paper presents a comparative analysis of state-of-the-art artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms for resource allocation. We systematically evaluate 10 algorithms across four categories: Deep Reinforcement Learning approaches, Neural Network architectures, Traditional Machine Learning enhanced methods, and Multi-Agent systems. Analysis of published results demonstrates significant performance improvements across multiple metrics including makespan reduction, cost optimization, and energy efficiency gains compared to traditional methods. The findings reveal that hybrid architectures combining multiple artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques consistently outperform single-method approaches, with edge computing environments showing the highest deployment readiness.

The design of \\texttt{hedom5} is inspired by recent iterative-greedy style domination heuristics~\\cite{IterativeGreedy22} that alternate between constructive steps, pruning, and focused repair rather than relying on a single pass. In \\texttt{hedom5}, the input graph is first stored in a compact CSR structure and simplified using fast reductions such as forcing neighbors of leaves and handling isolates. We then run a lazy gain-based greedy stage using a priority queue: each candidate vertex is scored by how many currently undominated vertices its closed neighborhood would newly dominate, and scores are only recomputed when necessary. After this constructive phase, we perform an aggressive backward pruning pass that iterates over the chosen dominators in reverse insertion order and deletes any vertex whose closed neighborhood is still fully dominated by the remaining set. Finally, we run a budgeted 1-swap local improvement step that attempts to replace a dominator by an alternative vertex that covers all of its uniquely covered vertices, thereby reducing the size of the dominating set. A brief safety patch at the end guarantees full domination."}

In Transformers, positional information is typically encoded using Positional Encodings (PEs). One such popular PE, namely Rotary PE (RoPE), has been widely used due to its empirical success. Recently, it has been argued that part of RoPE's success emerges from its ability to encode robust positional and semantic information using large and small frequencies, respectively. In this work, we perform a deeper dive into the positional versus symbolic dichotomy of attention heads behavior, both at the theoretical and empirical level. We provide general definitions of what it means for a head to behave positionally or symbolically, prove that these are two mutually exclusive behaviors and develop a metric to quantify them. We apply our framework to analyze Transformer-based LLMs using RoPE and find that all heads exhibit a strong correspondence between behavior and frequency use. Finally, we introduce canonical tasks designed to be either purely positional or symbolic, and demonstrate that the Transformer performance causally relates to the ability of attention heads to leverage the appropriate frequencies. In particular, we show that we can control the Transformer performance by controlling which frequencies the attention heads can access. Altogether, our work provides a detailed understanding of RoPE, and how its properties relate to model behavior."}

The problem is exacerbated in autoregressive (AR) LLM inference, where per-token forward passes repeatedly generate bulky intermediate features (IFs). We introduce SLICER, a retraining-free, architecture-agnostic framework that compresses IFs to reduce both communication and server load in split computing. SLICER combines (i) asymmetric top-K filtering (ATKF) to sparsify low-magnitude activations, (ii) magnitude-splitting (MS) to group the remaining non-zeros into equal-cardinality blocks, and (iii) adaptive bit quantization (ABQ) that selects per-block bitwidths under a distortion budget. Across standard vision and LLM workloads (e.g., ImageNet/COCO; HellaSwag, PIQA, ARC-E/C, GSM8K, HumanEval), SLICER reduces uplink volume by up to 10x and server GPU time by up to 4.4x, while keeping task quality within ~0-3 pp of baseline. In multi-device settings and AR LLMs, SLICER scales by shifting meaningful compute to the edge and lowering bits-per-token and server time per token, stabilizing per-step traffic. The codec attaches to off-the-shelf models without retraining or architectural changes, offering a plug-and-play path to scalable, low-latency distributed inference.

By efficiently tracking and updating Gaussian depth ordering instead of re-sorting from scratch, Neo significantly reduces redundant computations and memory bandwidth pressure.

This study evaluates twenty-one publicly available LLMs on a representative heterogeneous high-performance computing (HPC) workload mapping and scheduling problem. Each model received the same textual description of system nodes, task requirements, and scheduling constraints, and was required to assign tasks to nodes, compute the total makespan, and explain its reasoning. A manually derived analytical optimum of nine hours and twenty seconds served as the ground truth reference. Three models exactly reproduced the analytical optimum while satisfying all constraints, twelve achieved near-optimal results within two minutes of the reference, and six produced suboptimal schedules with arithmetic or dependency errors. All models generated feasible task-to-node mappings, though only about half maintained strict constraint adherence. Nineteen models produced partially executable verification code, and eighteen provided coherent step-by-step reasoning, demonstrating strong interpretability even when logical errors occurred. Overall, the results define the current capability boundary of LLM reasoning in combinatorial optimization: leading models can reconstruct optimal schedules directly from natural language, but most still struggle with precise timing, data transfer arithmetic, and dependency enforcement.

Our method first retrieves behaviorally relevant entities from a user's transaction KG and then uses this context to filter temporally consistent signals from a market KG, constructing a compact, grounded subgraph for the LLM.

First, when a model is trained to produce a safe-looking output, that model may generalize to making its CoTs look safe. Second, since later tokens are conditioned on earlier ones, safe-looking CoTs may increase the likelihood of safe outputs, causing safe-looking CoTs to be reinforced.

To address this issue, the COLISEUM project proposes a methodology for collecting data in three French sites to predict heritage material behaviour using artificial intelligence computer models. Over time, prediction models will allow the prediction of future material behaviours using known data from different climate change scenarios by the IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change).

Each site has a different climate and specific materials. In situ, microclimatic sensors continuously record variations parameters over time. The state of alteration is monitored at regular intervals by means of chemical analyses, cartographic measurements and scientific imaging campaigns. To implement weathering models, data is gathered in alteration matrix by mean of a calculated weathering index.

We propose FedGen-Edge, a framework that decouples a frozen, pre-trained global backbone from lightweight client-side adapters and federates only the adapters. Using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) constrains client updates to a compact subspace, which reduces uplink traffic by more than 99 percent versus full-model FedAvg, stabilizes aggregation under non-IID data, and naturally supports personalization because each client can keep a locally tuned adapter. On language modeling (PTB) and image generation (CIFAR-10), FedGen-Edge achieves lower perplexity/FID and faster convergence than strong baselines while retaining a simple FedAvg-style server. A brief ablation shows diminishing returns beyond moderate LoRA rank and a trade-off between local epochs and client drift.

However, two bottlenecks still limit further performance improvement: (1) non-stationary Q-value estimation caused by jointly injecting entropy and updating its weighting parameter, i.e., temperature; and (2) short-sighted local entropy tuning that adjusts temperature only according to the current single-step entropy, without considering the effect of cumulative entropy over time. In this paper, we extends maximum entropy framework by proposing a trajectory entropy-constrained reinforcement learning (TECRL) framework to address these two challenges. Within this framework, we first separately learn two Q-functions, one associated with reward and the other with entropy, ensuring clean and stable value targets unaffected by temperature updates. Then, the dedicated entropy Q-function, explicitly quantifying the expected cumulative entropy, enables us to enforce a trajectory entropy constraint and consequently control the policy long-term stochasticity. Building on this TECRL framework, we develop a practical off-policy algorithm, DSAC-E, by extending the state-of-the-art distributional soft actor-critic with three refinements (DSAC-T). Empirical results on the OpenAI Gym benchmark demonstrate that our DSAC-E can achieve higher returns and better stability."}

This \"one-policy-fits-all\" approach leads to significant compromises in fairness, throughput, and latency, particularly with the rise of heterogeneous hardware and varied application architectures.\n  This paper proposes a new paradigm: dynamically selecting the optimal policy from a portfolio of specialized schedulers rather than designing a single, monolithic one. We present the Adaptive Scheduling Agent (ASA), a lightweight framework that intelligently matches workloads to the most suitable \"expert\" scheduling policy at runtime. ASA's core is a novel, low-overhead offline/online approach. First, an offline process trains a universal, hardware-agnostic machine learning model to recognize abstract workload patterns from system behaviors. Second, at runtime, ASA continually processes the model's predictions using a time-weighted probability voting algorithm to identify the workload, then makes a scheduling decision by consulting a pre-configured, machine-specific mapping table to switch to the optimal scheduler via Linux's sched_ext framework. This decoupled architecture allows ASA to adapt to new hardware platforms rapidly without expensive retraining of the core recognition model.\n  Our evaluation, based on a novel benchmark focused on user-experience metrics, demonstrates that ASA consistently outperforms the default Linux scheduler (EEVDF), achieving superior results in 86.4% of test scenarios. Furthermore, ASA's selections are near-optimal, ranking among the top three schedulers in 78.6% of all scenarios. This validates our approach as a practical path toward more intelligent, adaptive, and responsive operating system schedulers."}

Part A: Stochastic Stability in Non-zero-Sum Games", "comment": null, "summary": "Reinforcement-based learning has attracted considerable attention both in modeling human behavior as well as in engineering, for designing measurement- or payoff-based optimization schemes. Such learning schemes exhibit several advantages, especially in relation to filtering out noisy observations. However, they may exhibit several limitations when applied in a distributed setup. In multi-player weakly-acyclic games, and when each player applies an independent copy of the learning dynamics, convergence to (usually desirable) pure Nash equilibria cannot be guaranteed. Prior work has only focused on a small class of games, namely potential and coordination games. To address this main limitation, this paper introduces a novel payoff-based learning scheme for distributed optimization, namely aspiration-based perturbed learning automata (APLA). In this class of dynamics, and contrary to standard reinforcement-based learning schemes, each player's probability distribution for selecting actions is reinforced both by repeated selection and an aspiration factor that captures the player's satisfaction level. We provide a stochastic stability analysis of APLA in multi-player positive-utility games under the presence of noisy observations. This is the first part of the paper that characterizes stochastic stability in generic non-zero-sum games by establishing equivalence of the induced infinite-dimensional Markov chain with a finite dimensional one.

In this work, we systematically study the effect of tokenizer design, specifically scaling and quantization strategies, on model performance, alongside the impact of pretraining versus random initialization. We show that tokenizer configuration primarily governs the representational capacity and stability of the model, while transfer learning influences optimization efficiency and alignment. Using a combination of empirical training experiments and theoretical analyses, we demonstrate that pretrained models consistently leverage well-designed tokenizers more effectively, particularly at smaller vocabulary sizes. Conversely, misaligned tokenization can diminish or even invert the benefits of pretraining. These findings highlight the importance of careful tokenization in time series modeling and suggest that combining small, efficient vocabularies with pretrained weights is especially advantageous in multi-modal forecasting settings, where the overall vocabulary must be shared across modalities. Our results provide concrete guidance for designing tokenizers and leveraging transfer learning in discrete representation learning for continuous signals."}

To solve these problems, recent research has focused on constructing cloud-edge consortia that integrate server-based LLM with small language models (SLMs) on mobile edge devices. Furthermore, designing collaborative training mechanisms within such consortia to enhance inference performance has emerged as a promising research direction. However, the cross-domain deployment of SLMs, coupled with structural heterogeneity in SLMs architectures, poses significant challenges to enhancing model performance. To this end, we propose Co-PLMs, a novel co-tuning framework for collaborative training of large and small language models, which integrates the process of structure-agnostic mutual learning to realize knowledge exchange between the heterogeneous language models. This framework employs distilled proxy models (DPMs) as bridges to enable collaborative training between the heterogeneous server-based LLM and on-device SLMs, while preserving the domain-specific insights of each device. The experimental results show that Co-PLMs outperform state-of-the-art methods, achieving average increases of 5.38% in Rouge-L and 4.88% in EM."}

By harnessing multi-modal deep learning methods to integrate heterogeneous and imbalanced electronic health records (EHR), we aim to advance early prediction of GVHD, paving the way for timely intervention and improved patient outcomes. In this study, we analyzed pre-transplant electronic health records (EHR) spanning the period before surgery for 2,100 liver transplantation patients, including 42 cases of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), from a cohort treated at Mayo Clinic between 1992 and 2025. The dataset comprised four major modalities: patient demographics, laboratory tests, diagnoses, and medications. We developed a multi-modal deep learning framework that dynamically fuses these modalities, handles irregular records with missing values, and addresses extreme class imbalance through AUC-based optimization. The developed framework outperforms all single-modal and multi-modal machine learning baselines, achieving an AUC of 0.836, an AUPRC of 0.157, a recall of 0.768, and a specificity of 0.803. It also demonstrates the effectiveness of our approach in capturing complementary information from different modalities, leading to improved performance. Our multi-modal deep learning framework substantially improves existing approaches for early GVHD prediction.

Despite the computation and communication efficiency of these systems, due to limited computation resources on edge devices, relying on more computationally rich systems on the cloud side is inevitable in most cases. Cloud inference systems can achieve the best performance while the computation and communication cost is dramatically increasing by the expansion of a number of edge devices relying on these systems. Hence, there is a trade-off between the computation, communication, and performance of these systems. In this paper, we propose a novel framework, dubbed as Eccentric that learns models with different levels of trade-offs between these conflicting objectives. This framework, based on an adaptation of knowledge from the edge model to the cloud one, reduces the computation and communication costs of the system during inference while achieving the best performance possible. The Eccentric framework can be considered as a new form of compression method suited for edge-cloud inference systems to reduce both computation and communication costs.

Adversarial attacks can subtly alter medical scans in ways invisible to the human eye yet powerful enough to mislead AI models, potentially causing serious misdiagnoses. Existing defenses often assume centralized data and struggle to cope with the decentralized and diverse nature of federated medical settings. In this work, we present MedFedPure, a personalized federated learning defense framework designed to protect diagnostic AI models at inference time without compromising privacy or accuracy. MedFedPure combines three key elements: (1) a personalized FL model that adapts to the unique data distribution of each institution; (2) a Masked Autoencoder (MAE) that detects suspicious inputs by exposing hidden perturbations; and (3) an adaptive diffusion-based purification module that selectively cleans only the flagged scans before classification. Together, these steps offer robust protection while preserving the integrity of normal, benign images. We evaluated MedFedPure on the Br35H brain MRI dataset. The results show a significant gain in adversarial robustness, improving performance from 49.50% to 87.33% under strong attacks, while maintaining a high clean accuracy of 97.67%.

Although recent deep learning and numerical acceleration methods have improved speed and scalability, they often rely on single CNN architectures or single neural operators, which struggle to generalize in unknown or complex geological settings and are ineffective at distinguishing diverse geological types. To address these issues, we propose a Structure-Aligned Encoder-Mixture-of-Operators (SA-EMO) architecture for velocity-field inversion under unknown subsurface structures. First, a structure-aligned encoder maps high-dimensional seismic wavefields into a physically consistent latent space, thereby eliminating spatio-temporal mismatch between the waveform and velocity domains, recovering high-frequency components, and enhancing feature generalization. Then, an adaptive routing mechanism selects and fuses multiple neural-operator experts, including spectral, wavelet, multiscale, and local operators, to predict the velocity model. We systematically evaluate our approach on the OpenFWI benchmark and the Marmousi2 dataset. Results show that SA-EMO significantly outperforms traditional CNN or single-operator methods, achieving an average MAE reduction of approximately 58.443% and an improvement in boundary resolution of about 10.308%. Ablation studies further reveal that the structure-aligned encoder, the expert-fusion mechanism, and the routing module each contribute markedly to the performance gains.

The loading and unloading sequences generated by strain gauges can be identified through time series classification (TSC) algorithms. Recently, deep learning models, e.g., convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have shown remarkable success in the TSC task, as they can extract discriminative local features from the subsequences to identify the time series. However, we observe that only the local features may not be sufficient for expressing the time series, especially when the local sub-sequences between different time series are very similar, e.g., SGS data of aircraft wings in static strength experiments. Nevertheless, CNNs suffer from the limitation in extracting global features due to the nature of convolution operations. For extracting global features to more comprehensively represent the SGS time series, we propose two insights: (i) Constructing global features through feature engineering. (ii) Learning high-order relationships between local features to capture global features. To realize and utilize them, we propose a hypergraph-based global feature learning and fusion framework, which learns and fuses global features for semantic consistency to enhance the representation of SGS time series, thereby improving recognition accuracy. Our method designs are validated on industrial SGS and public UCR datasets, showing better generalization for unseen data in SGS recognition."}

While effective in centralized systems, its behavior in decentralized settings, where network latency often dominates compute, remains under-characterized. We present Decentralized Speculative Decoding (DSD), a plug-and-play framework for decentralized inference that turns communication delay into useful computation by verifying multiple candidate tokens in parallel across distributed nodes. We further introduce an adaptive speculative verification strategy that adjusts acceptance thresholds by token-level semantic importance, delivering an additional 15% to 20% end-to-end speedup without retraining. In theory, DSD reduces cross-node communication cost by approximately (N-1)t1(k-1)/k, where t1 is per-link latency and k is the average number of tokens accepted per round. In practice, DSD achieves up to 2.56x speedup on HumanEval and 2.59x on GSM8K, surpassing the Eagle3 baseline while preserving accuracy. These results show that adapting speculative decoding for decentralized execution provides a system-level optimization that converts network stalls into throughput, enabling faster distributed LLM inference with no model retraining or architectural changes."}

Unlike full-field simulations, which are computationally demanding, the present work relies on mean-field statistical descriptors extracted from high-fidelity simulations. A dataset of 120 grain growth sequences was processed into normalized grain size distributions as a function of time. The models were trained to predict future distributions from a short temporal history using a recursive forecasting strategy. Among the tested models, the LSTM network achieved the highest accuracy (above 90\\%) and the most stable performance, maintaining physically consistent predictions over extended horizons while reducing computation time from about 20 minutes per sequence to only a few seconds, whereas the other architectures tended to diverge when forecasting further in time.

Probabilistic calibration metrics (Brier Score and Expected Calibration Error) are incorporated to ensure reliable risk predictions across subgroups. Random Forest, SVM, and XGBoost models were trained with isotonic and Platt scaling for calibration and fairness comparison. A calibrated Random Forest achieved a high predictive accuracy of 90.8%. SHAP analysis identified follicle count, weight gain, and menstrual irregularity as the most influential features, which are consistent with the Rotterdam diagnostic criteria.

Two improved PINN approaches were developed in this research: an adaptive approach with self-adaptive loss weighting and a conservative approach enforcing explicit conservation laws. Three benchmark tests were used to demonstrate how effective PINN's are as they relate to the type of problem being solved (i.e., time dependent RLW equation). The first was a single soliton traveling along a line (propagation), the second was the interaction between two solitons, and the third was the evolution of an undular bore over the course of $t=250$. The results demonstrated that the effectiveness of PINNs are problem specific. The adaptive PINN was significantly better than both the conservative PINN and the standard PINN at solving problems involving complex nonlinear interactions such as colliding two solitons. The conservative approach was significantly better at solving problems involving long term behavior of single solitons and undular bores. However, the most important finding from this research is that explicitly enforcing conservation laws may be harmful to optimizing the solution of highly nonlinear systems of equations and therefore requires special training methods. The results from our adaptive and conservative approaches were within $O(10^{-5})$ of established numerical solutions for the same problem, thus demonstrating that PINNs can provide accurate solutions to complex systems of partial differential equations without the need for a discretization of space or time (mesh free). Moreover, the finding from this research challenges the assumptions that conservation enforcement will always improve the performance of a PINN and provides researchers with guidelines for designing PINNs for use on specific types of problems."}

Directly feeding all IoT telemetry to LLMs is impractical due to finite context windows, prohibitive token costs at scale, and non-interactive latencies.

Running an LM locally on-device improves privacy, enables offline use, and reduces cost, but long-context inference quickly hits a \\emph{memory capacity wall} as the key-value (KV) cache grows linearly with context length and batch size.\n  We present KVSwap, a software framework to break this memory wall by offloading the KV cache to non-volatile secondary storage (disk). KVSwap leverages the observation that only a small, dynamically changing subset of KV entries is critical for generation. It stores the full cache on disk, uses a compact in-memory metadata to predict which entries to preload, overlaps computation with hardware-aware disk access, and orchestrates read patterns to match storage device characteristics. Our evaluation shows that across representative LMs and storage types, KVSwap delivers higher throughput under tight memory budgets while maintaining the generation quality when compared with existing KV cache offloading schemes."}

As of now, the academic community has rigorously verified the number of solutions only up to N <= 26. In 2016, the research team led by PreuBer solved the 27-Queens problem using FPGA hardware, which took approximately one year, though the result remains unverified independently. Recent studies on GPU parallel computing suggest that verifying the 27-Queens solution would still require about 17 months, indicating excessively high time and computational resource costs. To address this challenge, we propose an innovative parallel computing method on NVIDIA GPU platform, with the following core contributions: (1) An iterative depth-first search (DFS) algorithm for solving the N-Queens problem; (2) Complete mapping of the required stack structure to GPU shared memory; (3) Effective avoidance of bank conflicts through meticulously designed memory access patterns; (4) Various optimization techniques are employed to achieve optimal performance. Under the proposed optimization framework, we successfully verified the 27-Queens problem in just 28.4 days using eight RTX 5090 GPUs, thereby confirming the correctness of PreuBer's computational results. Moreover, we have reduced the projected solving time for the next open case-the 28-Queens problem-to approximately 11 months, making its resolution computationally feasible. Compared to the state-of-the-art GPU methods, our method achieves over 10x speedup on identical hardware configurations (8 A100), while delivering over 26x acceleration when utilizing 8 RTX 5090 GPUs, and brings fresh perspectives to this long-stagnant problem."}

Traditional RL-based beam selection models require extensive training time and computational resources, particularly when deployed in diverse environments with varying propagation characteristics posing a major challenge for scalability and energy efficiency. To address this, we propose modeling the environment as a point cloud, where each point represents the locations of gNodeBs (gNBs) and surrounding scatterers. By computing the Chamfer distance between point clouds, structurally similar environments can be efficiently identified, enabling the reuse of pre-trained models through transfer learning. This methodology leads to a 16x reduction in training time and computational overhead, directly contributing to energy efficiency. By minimizing the need for retraining in each new deployment, our approach significantly lowers power consumption and supports the development of green and sustainable Artificial Intelligence (AI) in wireless systems. Furthermore, it accelerates time-to-deployment, reduces carbon emissions associated with training, and enhances the viability of deploying AI-driven communication systems at the edge. Simulation results confirm that our approach maintains high performance while drastically cutting energy costs, demonstrating the potential of transfer learning to enable scalable, adaptive, and environmentally conscious RL-based beam selection strategies in dynamic and diverse propagation environments."}

GK Select leverages GK Sketch to identify a near-target pivot, extracts all values within the error bound around this pivot in each partition in linear time, and then tree-reduces the resulting candidate sets.

Consequently, the quality of time series data is crucial to TSFM performance, rendering an accurate and efficient data valuation of time series for TSFMs indispensable. However, traditional data valuation methods, such as influence functions, face severe computational bottlenecks due to their poor scalability with growing TSFM model sizes and often fail to preserve temporal dependencies. In this paper, we propose LTSV, a Lightweight Time Series Valuation on TSFMS via in-context finetuning. Grounded in the theoretical evidence that in-context finetuning approximates the influence function, LTSV estimates a sample's contribution by measuring the change in context loss after in-context finetuning, leveraging the strong generalization capabilities of TSFMs to produce robust and transferable data valuations. To capture temporal dependencies, we introduce temporal block aggregation, which integrates per-block influence scores across overlapping time windows. Experiments across multiple time series datasets and models demonstrate that LTSV consistently provides reliable and strong valuation performance, while maintaining manageable computational requirements. Our results suggest that in-context finetuning on time series foundation models provides a practical and effective bridge between data attribution and model generalization in time series learning."}

KV cache update, often implemented as allocation, copying, and in-place strided update for each generated token, incurs significant overhead. As the sequence length increases, the allocation and copy overheads dominate the performance. Alternate approaches may allocate large KV tensors upfront to enable in-place updates, but these matrices (with zero-padded rows) cause redundant computations. In this work, we propose a new KV cache allocation mechanism called Balancing Memory and Compute (BMC). BMC allocates, once every r iterations, KV tensors with r redundant rows, allowing in-place update without copy overhead for those iterations, but at the expense of a small amount of redundant computation. Second, we make an interesting observation that the extra rows allocated in the KV tensors and the resulting redundant computation can be repurposed for Speculative Decoding (SD) that improves token generation efficiency. Last, BMC represents a spectrum of design points with different values of r. To identify the best-performing design point(s), we derive a simple analytical model for BMC. The proposed BMC method achieves an average throughput acceleration of up to 3.2x over baseline HuggingFace (without SD). Importantly when we apply BMC with SD, it results in an additional speedup of up to 1.39x, over and above the speedup offered by SD. Further, BMC achieves a throughput acceleration of up to 1.36x and 2.29x over state-of-the-art inference servers vLLM and DeepSpeed, respectively. Although the BMC technique is evaluated extensively across different classes of CPUs (desktop and server class), we also evaluate the scheme with GPUs and demonstrate that it works well for GPUs."}

In this paper, we propose a new method for leak detection. The method is based on water pressure measurements acquired at a series of nodes of a WDN. Our technique is a fully data-driven solution that makes only use of the knowledge of the WDN topology, and a series of pressure data acquisitions obtained in absence of leaks. The proposed solution is based on an feature extractor and a one-class Support Vector Machines (SVM) trained on no-leak data, so that leaks are detected as anomalies.

To tackle the challenges, we propose a novel feature selection approach for robust depression analysis, called Incomplete Depression Feature Selection with Missing EEG Channels (IDFS-MEC). IDFS-MEC integrates missing-channel indicator information and adaptive channel weighting learning into orthogonal regression to lessen the effects of incomplete channels on model construction, and then utilizes global redundancy minimization learning to reduce redundant information among selected feature subsets. Extensive experiments conducted on MODMA and PRED-d003 datasets reveal that the EEG feature subsets chosen by IDFS-MEC have superior performance than 10 popular feature selection methods among 3-, 64-, and 128-channel settings."}

In this paper, we propose the Distributed Seasonal Temporal Pattern Mining (DSTPM), the first distributed framework for mining seasonal temporal patterns from time series. DSTPM leverages efficient data structures, specifically distributed hierarchical lookup hash structures, to enable efficient computation. Extensive experimental evaluations demonstrate that DSTPM significantly outperforms sequential baselines in runtime and memory usage, while scaling effectively to very large datasets."}

We found that substantial reductions in station numbers after one year of full deployment are possible while retaining high predictive accuracy. A reduction from 42 to 4 stations, for instance, increased mean prediction RMSEs from 0.69 K to 0.83 K for air temperature and from 3.8% to 4.4% for relative humidity, corresponding to RMSE increases of only 20% and 16%, respectively. Predictive accuracy is worse for remote stations in forests than for stations in built-up or open settings, but consistently better than a state-of-the-art numerical urban land-surface model (Surface Urban Energy and Water Balance Scheme).

Identifying the true source of such anomalies, known as Root Cause Localization (RCL), is essential for timely mitigation. However, existing RCL approaches are designed for cloud environments and rely on centralized analysis, which increases latency and communication overhead when applied at the edge. This paper proposes a decentralized RCL approach that executes localization directly at the edge device level using the Personalized PageRank (PPR) algorithm. The proposed method first groups microservices into communication- and colocation-aware clusters, thereby confining most anomaly propagation within cluster boundaries. Within each cluster, PPR is executed locally to identify the root cause, significantly reducing localization time. For the rare cases where anomalies propagate across clusters, we introduce an inter-cluster peer-to-peer approximation process, enabling lightweight coordination among clusters with minimal communication overhead. To enhance the accuracy of localization in heterogeneous edge environments, we also propose a novel anomaly scoring mechanism tailored to the diverse anomaly triggers that arise across microservice, device, and network layers. Evaluation results on the publicly available edge dataset, MicroCERCL, demonstrate that the proposed decentralized approach achieves comparable or higher localization accuracy than its centralized counterpart while reducing localization time by up to 34%. These findings highlight that decentralized graph-based RCL can provide a practical and efficient solution for anomaly diagnosis in resource-constrained edge environments."}

We propose SpecQuant, a two-stage framework that tackles activation outliers and cross-channel variance. In the first stage, activation outliers are smoothed and transferred into the weight matrix to simplify downstream quantization. In the second stage, we apply channel-wise low-frequency Fourier truncation to suppress high-frequency components while preserving essential signal energy, improving quantization robustness. Our method builds on the principle that most of the weight energy is concentrated in low-frequency components, which can be retained with minimal impact on model accuracy. To enable runtime adaptability, we introduce a lightweight truncation module during inference that adjusts truncation thresholds based on channel characteristics.

Spherical RoPE is one such non-commutative variant, motivated by the idea of rotating embedding vectors on spheres rather than circles. However, spherical rotations are inherently non-commutative, making the choice of rotation sequence ambiguous. In this work, we explore a quaternion-based approach -- Quaternion Rotary Embeddings (QuatRo) -- in place of Euler angles, leveraging quaternions' ability to represent 3D rotations to parameterize the axes of rotation. We show Mixed RoPE and Spherical RoPE to be special cases of QuatRo. Further, we propose a generalization of QuatRo to Clifford Algebraic Rotary Embeddings (CARE) using geometric algebra. Viewing quaternions as the even subalgebra of Cl(3,0,0), we extend the notion of rotary embeddings from quaternions to Clifford rotors acting on multivectors.

Existing stochastic gradient Markov Chain Monte Carlo (SGMCMC) methods are highly sensitive to the choice of stepsize and adaptive variants such as pSGLD typically fail to sample the correct invariant measure without addition of a costly divergence correction term. In this work, we build on the recently proposed `SamAdams' framework for timestep adaptation (Leimkuhler, Lohmann, and Whalley 2025), introducing an adaptive scheme: SA-SGLD, which employs time rescaling to modulate the stepsize according to a monitored quantity (typically the local gradient norm). SA-SGLD can automatically shrink stepsizes in regions of high curvature and expand them in flatter regions, improving both stability and mixing without introducing bias. We show that our method can achieve more accurate posterior sampling than SGLD on high-curvature 2D toy examples and in image classification with BNNs using sharp priors."}

While node-level energy consumption data can be directly measured with hardware such as power meters, existing mechanisms for estimating per-process energy usage, such as Intel RAPL, are limited to specific hardware and provide only coarse-grained, domain-level measurements. Our proposed approach models per-process energy profiles by leveraging fine-grained process-level resource metrics collected via eBPF and perf, which are synchronized with node-level energy measurements obtained from an attached power distribution unit. By statistically learning the relationship between process-level resource usage and node-level energy consumption through a regression-based model, our approach enables more fine-grained per-process energy predictions."}

To address these limitations, we propose Knowledge Density-Guided Unlearning via Blocks Reinsertion (KUnBR), a novel approach that first identifies layers with rich harmful knowledge and then thoroughly eliminates the harmful knowledge via re-insertion strategy. Our method introduces knowledge density estimation to quantify and locate layers containing the most harmful knowledge, enabling precise unlearning.

In addition, we formulate the joint problem of wireless and computing resource management with optimal slice selection as a mixed-integer nonlinear program (MINLP). Because solving this model online is computationally intensive, we decompose it into three sub-problems (SP1) intra-slice allocation, (SP2) inter-slice allocation, and (SP3) offloading decision and train a distributed hierarchical DeepSets-based model (DeepSets-S) on optimal solutions obtained offline. In the proposed model, we design a slack-aware normalization mechanism for a shared encoder and task-specific decoders, ensuring permutation equivariance over variable-size wireless device (WD) sets. The learned system produces near-optimal allocations with low inference time and maintains permutation equivariance over variable-size device sets.

Using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) constrains client updates to a compact subspace, which reduces uplink traffic by more than 99 percent versus full-model FedAvg, stabilizes aggregation under non-IID data, and naturally supports personalization because each client can keep a locally tuned adapter.

Although artificial intelligence (AI) substantially improves CXR-based detection, development is hindered by globally distributed data, high inter-hospital variability, and strict privacy regulations (e.g., HIPAA, GDPR) that make centralization impractical. These constraints are compounded by heterogeneous imaging protocols, uneven data availability, and the costs of transferring large medical images across geographically dispersed sites.\n  In this paper, we evaluate Federated Learning (FL) using the Sherpa.ai FL platform, enabling multiple hospitals (nodes) to collaboratively train a CXR classifier for pneumonia while keeping data in place and private. Using the Pediatric Pneumonia Chest X-ray dataset, we simulate cross-hospital collaboration with non-independent and non-identically distributed (non-IID) data, reproducing real-world variability across institutions and jurisdictions. Our experiments demonstrate that collaborative and privacy-preserving training across multiple hospitals via FL led to a dramatic performance improvement achieving 0.900 Accuracy and 0.966 ROC-AUC, corresponding to 47.5% and 50.0% gains over single-hospital models (0.610; 0.644), without transferring any patient CXR. These results indicate that FL delivers high-performing, generalizable, secure and private pneumonia detection across healthcare networks, with data kept local. This is especially relevant for rare diseases, where FL enables secure multi-institutional collaboration without data movement, representing a breakthrough for accelerating diagnosis and treatment development in low-data domains."}

This rapid degradation limits the achievable compression ratio and prevents models from meeting the stringent size constraints required by certain hardware platforms, rendering them inoperable. To overcome this limitation, we propose a bidirectional pruning-regrowth strategy. Starting from an extremely compressed network that satisfies hardware constraints, the method selectively regenerates critical connections to recover lost performance, effectively mitigating the sharp accuracy drop commonly observed under high sparsity conditions."}

We show how to use them to solve Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) explicitly discretized on a computational stencil. From this point of view, the QPU serves as a sampling accelerator. Each micro-kernel consumes only stencil inputs (neighbor values and coefficients), runs a shallow parameterized circuit, and reports the sample mean of a readout rule. The resource footprint in qubits and depth is fixed and independent of the global grid. This makes micro-kernels easy to orchestrate from a classical host and to parallelize across grid points. We present two realizations. The Bernoulli micro-kernel targets convex-sum stencils by encoding values as single-qubit probabilities with shot allocation proportional to stencil weights. The branching micro-kernel prepares a selector over stencil branches and applies addressed rotations to a single readout qubit. In contrast to monolithic quantum PDE solvers that encode the full space-time problem in one deep circuit, our approach keeps the classical time loop and offloads only local updates. Batching and in-circuit fusion amortize submission and readout overheads. We test and validate the QPU micro-kernel method on two PDEs commonly arising in scientific computing: the Heat and viscous Burgers' equations. On noiseless quantum circuit simulators, accuracy improves as the number of samples increases. On the IBM Brisbane quantum computer, single-step diffusion tests show lower errors for the Bernoulli realization than for branching at equal shot budgets, with QPU micro-kernel execution dominating the wall time."}

For instance, after learning to detect traffic signs, a model may later need to learn to classify traffic lights or different types of vehicles using the same camera feed. This scenario introduces a challenging setting we term Continual Multitask Learning (CMTL), where a model sequentially learns new tasks on an underlying data distribution without forgetting previously learned abilities. Existing continual learning methods often fail in this setting because they learn fragmented, task-specific features that interfere with one another. To address this, we introduce Learning with Preserving (LwP), a novel framework that shifts the focus from preserving task outputs to maintaining the geometric structure of the shared representation space. The core of LwP is a Dynamically Weighted Distance Preservation (DWDP) loss that prevents representation drift by regularizing the pairwise distances between latent data representations. This mechanism of preserving the underlying geometric structure allows the model to retain implicit knowledge and support diverse tasks without requiring a replay buffer, making it suitable for privacy-conscious applications. Extensive evaluations on time-series and image benchmarks show that LwP not only mitigates catastrophic forgetting but also consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in CMTL tasks. Notably, our method shows superior robustness to distribution shifts and is the only approach to surpass the strong single-task learning baseline, underscoring its effectiveness for real-world dynamic environments."}

We propose adapting Linear Probing followed by full Fine-Tuning (LP-FT), a principled centralized strategy for alleviating feature distortion (Kumar et al., 2022), to the FL setting. Through systematic evaluation across seven datasets and six PFT variants, we demonstrate LP-FT's superiority in balancing personalization and generalization.

We evaluate the proposed method on standard IEEE AC-OPF benchmarks and show that homotopy-guided L2O significantly increases feasibility rates compared to non-homotopy baselines, while achieving objective values comparable to full OPF solvers.

While existing surveys describe these phenomena empirically, they lack a rigorous theoretical synthesis connecting them to the foundational limits of computation, information, and learning. This work closes that gap by presenting a unified, proof-informed framework that formalizes the innate theoretical ceilings of LLM scaling. First, computability and uncomputability imply an irreducible residue of error: for any computably enumerable model family, diagonalization guarantees inputs on which some model must fail, and undecidable queries (e.g., halting-style tasks) induce infinite failure sets for all computable predictors. Second, information-theoretic and statistical constraints bound attainable accuracy even on decidable tasks, finite description length enforces compression error, and long-tail factual knowledge requires prohibitive sample complexity. Third, geometric and computational effects compress long contexts far below their nominal size due to positional under-training, encoding attenuation, and softmax crowding. We further show how likelihood-based training favors pattern completion over inference, how retrieval under token limits suffers from semantic drift and coupling noise, and how multimodal scaling inherits shallow cross-modal alignment. Across sections, we pair theorems and empirical evidence to outline where scaling helps, where it saturates, and where it cannot progress, providing both theoretical foundations and practical mitigation paths like bounded-oracle retrieval, positional curricula, and sparse or hierarchical attention."}

Spatial cross-validation revealed moderate transferability, yielding ROC-AUC values of 0.6155 for forests and 0.5416 for grasslands. In contrast, temporal split validation showed enhanced generalization, especially for forests (ROC-AUC = 0.6615, PR-AUC = 0.8423). SHAP-based XAI analysis identified key ecosystem-specific drivers: soil organic carbon, tree cover, and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) emerged as the most influential in forests, whereas Land Surface Temperature (LST), elevation, and vegetation health indices were dominant in grasslands. District-level classification revealed that Central Valley and Northern Buttes districts had the highest concentration of high-risk grasslands, while Northern Buttes and North Coast Redwoods dominated forested high-risk areas. This RF-SHAP framework offers a robust, comprehensible, and adaptable method for assessing wildfire risks, enabling informed decisions and creating targeted strategies to mitigate dangers."}

Current deep learning approaches primarily focus on encoder-decoder architectural refinements. However, existing methodologies exhibit several limitations:(1)they rely on dilated convolutions for multi-scale context extraction, lacking the partial feature effectiveness and interoperability of inter-channel;(2)attention-based feature enhancement implementations neglect accuracy-throughput balance; and (3)the decoder modifications fail to establish global interdependencies among hierarchical local features, limiting inference efficiency. To address these challenges, we propose MPCM-Net, a Multi-scale network that integrates Partial attention Convolutions with Mamba architectures to enhance segmentation accuracy and computational efficiency. Specifically, the encoder incorporates MPAC, which comprises:(1)a MPC block with ParCM and ParSM that enables global spatial interaction across multi-scale cloud formations, and (2)a MPA block combining ParAM and ParSM to extract discriminative features with reduced computational complexity. On the decoder side, a M2B is employed to mitigate contextual loss through a SSHD that maintains linear complexity while enabling deep feature aggregation across spatial and scale dimensions. As a key contribution to the community, we also introduce and release a dataset CSRC, which is a clear-label, fine-grained segmentation benchmark designed to overcome the critical limitations of existing public datasets. Extensive experiments on CSRC demonstrate the superior performance of MPCM-Net over state-of-the-art methods, achieving an optimal balance between segmentation accuracy and inference speed.

For example, an oncologist may first conduct a breast exam, followed by a mammogram for patients with concerning exams, followed by a biopsy for patients with concerning mammograms. A key challenge is that the ground truth outcome, such as the biopsy result, is only revealed at the end of this funnel. The selective censoring of the ground truth can introduce statistical biases in risk estimation, especially in underserved patient groups, whose outcomes are more frequently censored. We develop a Bayesian model for funnel decision structures, drawing from prior work on selective labels and censoring. We first show in synthetic settings that our model is able to recover the true parameters and predict outcomes for censored patients more accurately than baselines. We then apply our model to a dataset of emergency department visits, where in-hospital mortality is observed only for those who are admitted to either the hospital or ICU. We find that there are gender-based differences in hospital and ICU admissions. In particular, our model estimates that the mortality risk threshold to admit women to the ICU is higher for women (5.1%) than for men (4.5%)."}

A key hurdle lies in accessing the original training data, as fine-tuning solely on new data often leads to catastrophic forgetting. To address this issue, we propose Replay Tuning (R-Tuning), a novel framework designed for the continual adaptation of pre-trained time-series models. R-Tuning constructs a unified latent space that captures both prior and current task knowledge through a frequency-aware replay strategy. Specifically, it augments model-generated samples via wavelet-based decomposition across multiple frequency bands, generating trend-preserving and fusion-enhanced variants to improve representation diversity and replay efficiency. To further reduce reliance on synthetic samples, R-Tuning introduces a latent consistency constraint that aligns new representations with the prior task space. This constraint guides joint optimization within a compact and semantically coherent latent space, ensuring robust knowledge retention and adaptation. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the superiority of R-Tuning, which reduces MAE and MSE by up to 46.9% and 46.8%, respectively, on new tasks, while preserving prior knowledge with gains of up to 5.7% and 6.0% on old tasks. Notably, under few-shot settings, R-Tuning outperforms all state-of-the-art baselines even when synthetic proxy samples account for only 5% of the new task dataset."}

In this work, we propose the Regularized Schrödinger Bridge (RSB), an adaptation of Schrödinger Bridge tailored for inverse problems that addresses the above limitations. RSB employs a novel regularized training strategy that perturbs both the input states and targets, effectively mitigating exposure bias by exposing the model to simulated prediction errors and also alleviating distortion by well-designed interpolation via the posterior mean. Extensive experiments on two typical inverse problems for speech enhancement demonstrate that RSB outperforms state-of-the-art methods, significantly improving distortion metrics and effectively reducing exposure bias."}

A powerful training-free strategy to accelerate this process is Schedule Optimization, which aims to find an optimal distribution of timesteps for a fixed and small Number of Function Evaluations (NFE) to maximize sample quality. To this end, a successful schedule optimization method must adhere to four core principles: effectiveness, adaptivity, practical robustness, and computational efficiency. However, existing paradigms struggle to satisfy these principles simultaneously, motivating the need for a more advanced solution. To overcome these limitations, we propose the Hierarchical-Schedule-Optimizer (HSO), a novel and efficient bi-level optimization framework. HSO reframes the search for a globally optimal schedule into a more tractable problem by iteratively alternating between two synergistic levels: an upper-level global search for an optimal initialization strategy and a lower-level local optimization for schedule refinement. This process is guided by two key innovations: the Midpoint Error Proxy (MEP), a solver-agnostic and numerically stable objective for effective local optimization, and the Spacing-Penalized Fitness (SPF) function, which ensures practical robustness by penalizing pathologically close timesteps. Extensive experiments show that HSO sets a new state-of-the-art for training-free sampling in the extremely low-NFE regime. For instance, with an NFE of just 5, HSO achieves a remarkable FID of 11.94 on LAION-Aesthetics with Stable Diffusion v2.1. Crucially, this level of performance is attained not through costly retraining, but with a one-time optimization cost of less than 8 seconds, presenting a highly practical and efficient paradigm for diffusion model acceleration."}

However, tuning the learnable prompts solely based on unlabeled test data may induce prompt optimization bias, ultimately leading to suboptimal performance on downstream tasks. In this work, we analyze the underlying causes of prompt optimization bias from both the model and data perspectives. In terms of the model, the entropy minimization objective typically focuses on reducing the entropy of model predictions while overlooking their correctness. This can result in overconfident yet incorrect outputs, thereby compromising the quality of prompt optimization. On the data side, prompts affected by optimization bias can introduce misalignment between visual and textual modalities, which further aggravates the prompt optimization bias. To this end, we propose a Doubly Debiased Test-Time Prompt Tuning method. Specifically, we first introduce a dynamic retrieval-augmented modulation module that retrieves high-confidence knowledge from a dynamic knowledge base using the test image feature as a query, and uses the retrieved knowledge to modulate the predictions. Guided by the refined predictions, we further develop a reliability-aware prompt optimization module that incorporates a confidence-based weighted ensemble and cross-modal consistency distillation to impose regularization constraints during prompt tuning. Extensive experiments across 15 benchmark datasets involving both natural distribution shifts and cross-datasets generalization demonstrate that our method outperforms baselines, validating its effectiveness in mitigating prompt optimization bias."}

As such, we reformulate text-to-3D optimization as mapping a dynamically evolving source distribution to a fixed target distribution. We cast the problem into a dual-conditioned latent space, conditioned on both the text prompt and the intermediately rendered image. Given this joint setup, we observe that the image condition naturally anchors the current source distribution. Building on this insight, we introduce AnchorDS, an improved score distillation mechanism that provides state-anchored guidance with image conditions and stabilizes generation. We further penalize erroneous source estimates and design a lightweight filter strategy and fine-tuning strategy that refines the anchor with negligible overhead. AnchorDS produces finer-grained detail, more natural colours, and stronger semantic consistency, particularly for complex prompts, while maintaining efficiency. Extensive experiments show that our method surpasses previous methods in both quality and efficiency."}

These models produce embeddings that can be used as analysis-ready datasets, enabling the modelling of ecosystem dynamics without extensive sensor-specific preprocessing. However, existing models typically operate at fixed spatial or temporal scales, limiting their use for ecological analyses that require both fine spatial detail and high temporal fidelity. To overcome these limitations, we propose a representation learning framework that integrates different EO modalities into a unified feature space at high spatio-temporal resolution. We introduce the framework using Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 data as representative modalities. Our approach produces a latent space at native 10 m resolution and the temporal frequency of cloud-free Sentinel-2 acquisitions. Each sensor is first modeled independently to capture its sensor-specific characteristics. Their representations are then combined into a shared model. This two-stage design enables modality-specific optimisation and easy extension to new sensors, retaining pretrained encoders while retraining only fusion layers. This enables the model to capture complementary remote sensing data and to preserve coherence across space and time. Qualitative analyses reveal that the learned embeddings exhibit high spatial and semantic consistency across heterogeneous landscapes. Quantitative evaluation in modelling Gross Primary Production reveals that they encode ecologically meaningful patterns and retain sufficient temporal fidelity to support fine-scale analyses. Overall, the proposed framework provides a flexible, analysis-ready representation learning approach for environmental applications requiring diverse spatial and temporal resolutions."}

Our method employs a fast network (NN1) for immediate adaptation to new tasks and a slow network (NN2) that consolidates knowledge through distillation and replay. Within the family of MLP-based NN1 variants we evaluated, consolidation effectiveness is driven more by methodology than architectural embellishments -- a simple MLP outperforms more complex similarity-gated variants by 1.2pp. Through systematic hyperparameter analysis, we observed empirically that pure replay without distillation during consolidation achieves superior performance, consistent with the hypothesis that distillation from the fast network introduces recency bias. On Split-MNIST (30 seeds), FSC-Net achieves 91.71% +/- 0.62% retention accuracy, a +4.27pp gain over the fast network alone (87.43% +/- 1.27%, paired t=23.585, p < 1e-10).

Although artificial intelligence (AI) substantially improves CXR-based detection, development is hindered by globally distributed data, high inter-hospital variability, and strict privacy regulations (e.g., HIPAA, GDPR) that make centralization impractical. These constraints are compounded by heterogeneous imaging protocols, uneven data availability, and the costs of transferring large medical images across geographically dispersed sites.\n  In this paper, we evaluate Federated Learning (FL) using the Sherpa.ai FL platform, enabling multiple hospitals (nodes) to collaboratively train a CXR classifier for pneumonia while keeping data in place and private. Using the Pediatric Pneumonia Chest X-ray dataset, we simulate cross-hospital collaboration with non-independent and non-identically distributed (non-IID) data, reproducing real-world variability across institutions and jurisdictions. Our experiments demonstrate that collaborative and privacy-preserving training across multiple hospitals via FL led to a dramatic performance improvement achieving 0.900 Accuracy and 0.966 ROC-AUC, corresponding to 47.5% and 50.0% gains over single-hospital models (0.610; 0.644), without transferring any patient CXR. These results indicate that FL delivers high-performing, generalizable, secure and private pneumonia detection across healthcare networks, with data kept local. This is especially relevant for rare diseases, where FL enables secure multi-institutional collaboration without data movement, representing a breakthrough for accelerating diagnosis and treatment development in low-data domains."}

To address these limitations, we develop a vision-based surrogate modeling framework that operates directly on a 3D voxelized representation of the data center, incorporating server workloads, fan speeds, and HVAC temperature set points. We evaluate multiple architectures, including 3D CNN U-Net variants, a 3D Fourier Neural Operator, and 3D vision transformers, to map these thermal inputs to high-fidelity heat maps. Our results show that the surrogate models generalize across data center configurations and achieve up to 20,000x speedup (hundreds of milliseconds vs. hours).

Standard Neural ODEs and physics informed variants often require orders of magnitude more iterations, and even then may converge to suboptimal solutions that fail to preserve oscillatory frequency or amplitude. We introduce PhysicsInformed Neural ODEs with with Scale-Aware Residuals (PI-NODE-SR), a framework that combines a low-order explicit solver (Heun method) residual normalisation to balance contributions between state variables evolving on disparate timescales. This combination stabilises training under realistic iteration budgets and avoids reliance on computationally expensive implicit solvers. On the Hodgkin-Huxley equations, PI-NODE-SR learns from a single oscillation simulated with a stiff solver (Rodas5P) and extrapolates beyond 100 ms, capturing both oscillation frequency and near-correct amplitudes. Remarkably, end-to-end learning of the vector field enables PI-NODE-SR to recover morphological features such as sharp subthreshold curvature in gating variables that are typically reserved for higher-order solvers, suggesting that neural correction can offset numerical diffusion. While performance remains sensitive to initialisation, PI-NODE-SR consistently reduces long-horizon errors relative to baseline Neural-ODEs and PINNs, offering a principled route to stable and efficient learning of stiff biological dynamics."}

To address this, we propose DK-Root, a joint data-and-knowledge-driven framework that unifies scalable weak supervision with precise expert guidance for robust root-cause analysis. DK-Root first pretrains an encoder via contrastive representation learning using abundant rule-based labels while explicitly denoising their noise through a supervised contrastive objective. To supply task-faithful data augmentation, we introduce a class-conditional diffusion model that generates KPIs sequences preserving root-cause semantics, and by controlling reverse diffusion steps, it produces weak and strong augmentations that improve intra-class compactness and inter-class separability. Finally, the encoder and the lightweight classifier are jointly fine-tuned with scarce expert-verified labels to sharpen decision boundaries. Extensive experiments on a real-world, operator-grade dataset demonstrate state-of-the-art accuracy, with DK-Root surpassing traditional ML and recent semi-supervised time-series methods. Ablations confirm the necessity of the conditional diffusion augmentation and the pretrain-finetune design, validating both representation quality and classification gains."}

Evaluated on audio classification benchmarks (ESC-50, Quinn, UrbanSound8K), our 4-bit quantization maintains 99.9 percent of 16-bit accuracy (0.858 vs 0.859 F1) with 4x compression and 41 percent energy savings versus 8-bit. Crucially, curiosity-driven routing reduces MoE latency variance by 82 percent (p = 0.008, Levene's test) from 230 ms to 29 ms standard deviation, enabling stable inference for battery-constrained devices. Statistical analysis confirms 4-bit/8-bit achieve practical equivalence with full precision (p > 0.05), while MoE architectures introduce 11 percent latency overhead (p < 0.001) without accuracy gains. At scale, deployment emissions dominate training by 10000x for models serving more than 1,000 inferences, making inference efficiency critical. Our information-theoretic routing demonstrates that adaptive quantization yields accurate (0.858 F1, 1.2M params), energy-efficient (3.87 F1/mJ), and predictable edge models, with simple 4-bit quantized architectures outperforming complex MoE for most deployments."}

To address this, we propose an effective Identity Distribution-Oriented Physical Invariant Learning framework (IDOL), which imposes identity-oriented constraints to regulate the feature space under the guidance of prior physical knowledge, thereby dealing distribution variability with physical invariance. Specifically, the proposed IDOL employs the wind field model and dark correlation knowledge of TC to model task-shared and task-specific identity tokens. These tokens capture task dependencies and intrinsic physical invariances of TC, enabling robust estimation of TC wind speed, pressure, inner-core, and outer-core size under distribution shifts. Extensive experiments conducted on multiple datasets and tasks demonstrate the outperformance of the proposed IDOL, verifying that imposing identity-oriented constraints based on prior physical knowledge can effectively mitigates diverse distribution shifts in TC estimation.Code is available at https://github.com/Zjut-MultimediaPlus/IDOL."}

Moreover, the reliance on black-box models hinders interpretability, limiting their applicability in socially sensitive domains. In this paper, we try to circumvent these issues by integrating Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) within a fair adversarial learning framework. Leveraging the adversarial robustness and interpretability of KANs, our approach enables a balance between fairness and accuracy. To further facilitate this balance, we propose an adaptive penalty update mechanism that dynamically adjusts fairness constraints during the model training.

We investigate the strategic effect of transparency for agents through the lens of transferable adversarial example attacks. In transferable adversarial example attacks, attackers maliciously perturb their inputs using surrogate models to fool a defender's target model. These models can be defended or undefended, with both players having to decide which to use. Using a large-scale empirical evaluation of nine attacks across 181 models, we find that attackers are more successful when they match the defender's decision; hence, obscurity could be beneficial to the defender. With game theory, we analyze this trade-off between transparency and security by modeling this problem as both a Nash game and a Stackelberg game, and comparing the expected outcomes. Our analysis confirms that only knowing whether a defender's model is defended or not can sometimes be enough to damage its security. This result serves as an indicator of the general trade-off between transparency and security, suggesting that transparency in AI systems can be at odds with security. Beyond adversarial machine learning, our work illustrates how game-theoretic reasoning can uncover conflicts between transparency and security."}

Here, we explore the performance of two representative models for predicting GPP: 1) GPT-2, a transformer architecture, and 2) Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), a recurrent neural network, using multivariate inputs. Overall, both achieve similar accuracy. But, while LSTM performs better overall, GPT-2 excels during extreme events. Analysis of temporal context length further reveals that LSTM attains similar accuracy using substantially shorter input windows than GPT-2, highlighting an accuracy-efficiency trade-off between the two architectures. Feature importance analysis reveals radiation as the dominant predictor, followed by Sentinel-2, MODIS land surface temperature, and Sentinel-1 contributions. Our results demonstrate how model architecture, context length, and multimodal inputs jointly determine performance in GPP prediction, guiding future developments of DL frameworks for monitoring terrestrial carbon dynamics."}

Adversarial learning, particularly through self-play, offers a promising alternative that enables models to iteratively learn from themselves - thus reducing reliance on external supervision. Dual-play extends adversarial learning by assigning specialized roles to two models and training them against each other, fostering sustained competition and mutual evolution. Despite its promise, adapting dual-play training to LLMs remains limited, largely due to their susceptibility to reward hacking and training instability. In this paper, we introduce PasoDoble, a novel LLM dual-play framework. PasoDoble adversarially trains two models initialized from the same base model: a Proposer, which generates challenging questions with ground-truth answers, and a Solver, which attempts to solve them. We enrich the Proposer with knowledge from a pre-training dataset to ensure the questions' quality and diversity. To avoid reward hacking, the Proposer is rewarded for producing only valid questions that push the Solver's limit, while the Solver is rewarded for solving them correctly, and both are updated jointly. To further enhance training stability, we introduce an optional offline paradigm that decouples Proposer and Solver updates, alternately updating each for several steps while holding the other fixed. Notably, PasoDoble operates without supervision during training. Experimental results show that PasoDoble can improve the reasoning performance of LLMs. Our project page is available at https://hcy123902.github.io/PasoDoble."}

Counterfactual explanations are widely used to provide actionable \"what-if\" recourse, but they typically remain instance-specific and do not quantify which features systematically drive outcome changes within coherent regions of the feature space or across an entire dataset. We introduce FLEX (Feature importance from Layered counterfactual EXplanations), a model- and domain-agnostic framework that converts sets of counterfactuals into feature change frequency scores at local, regional, and global levels. FLEX generalises local change-frequency measures by aggregating across instances and neighbourhoods, offering interpretable rankings that reflect how often each feature must change to flip predictions. The framework is compatible with different counterfactual generation methods, allowing users to emphasise characteristics such as sparsity, feasibility, or actionability, thereby tailoring the derived feature importances to practical constraints. We evaluate FLEX on two contrasting tabular tasks: traffic accident severity prediction and loan approval, and compare FLEX to SHAP- and LIME-derived feature importance values. Results show that (i) FLEX's global rankings correlate with SHAP while surfacing additional drivers, and (ii) regional analyses reveal context-specific factors that global summaries miss. FLEX thus bridges the gap between local recourse and global attribution, supporting transparent and intervention-oriented decision-making in risk-sensitive applications."}

Diffusion-based models, particularly latent diffusion models (LDMs), have recently shown promise by performing stochastic search in a continuous latent space that compactly captures molecular semantics. Yet existing methods rely on one-shot conditioning, where the entire prompt is encoded once and applied throughout diffusion, making it hard to satisfy all the requirements in the prompt. We discuss three outstanding challenges of one-shot conditioning generation, including the poor interpretability of the generated components, the failure to generate all substructures, and the overambition in considering all requirements simultaneously. We then propose three principles to address those challenges, motivated by which we propose Chain-of-Generation (CoG), a training-free multi-stage latent diffusion framework. CoG decomposes each prompt into curriculum-ordered semantic segments and progressively incorporates them as intermediate goals, guiding the denoising trajectory toward molecules that satisfy increasingly rich linguistic constraints. To reinforce semantic guidance, we further introduce a post-alignment learning phase that strengthens the correspondence between textual and molecular latent spaces. Extensive experiments on benchmark and real-world tasks demonstrate that CoG yields higher semantic alignment, diversity, and controllability than one-shot baselines, producing molecules that more faithfully reflect complex, compositional prompts while offering transparent insight into the generation process."}

Through comprehensive experiments, we identify two key principles -- orthogonal weight matrices (OWM) and gradient-pattern alignment (GPA) -- as central to enhancing the robustness of BAM. Motivated by these findings, we introduce new regularization strategies into B-BP, resulting in models with greatly improved resistance to corruption and adversarial perturbations. We further conduct an ablation study across different training strategies to determine the most robust configuration and evaluate BAM's performance under a variety of attack scenarios and memory capacities, including 50, 100, and 200 associative pairs.

As models scale up, pretrained graph models have become valuable intellectual assets because they encode extensive computation and domain expertise. Building on these advances, Graph Foundation Models (GFMs) mark a major step forward by jointly pretraining graph and text encoders on massive and diverse data. This unifies structural and semantic understanding, enables zero-shot inference, and supports applications such as fraud detection and biomedical analysis. However, the high pretraining cost and broad cross-domain knowledge in GFMs also make them attractive targets for model extraction attacks (MEAs). Prior work has focused only on small graph neural networks trained on a single graph, leaving the security implications for large-scale and multimodal GFMs largely unexplored. This paper presents the first systematic study of MEAs against GFMs. We formalize a black-box threat model and define six practical attack scenarios covering domain-level and graph-specific extraction goals, architectural mismatch, limited query budgets, partial node access, and training data discrepancies. To instantiate these attacks, we introduce a lightweight extraction method that trains an attacker encoder using supervised regression of graph embeddings. Even without contrastive pretraining data, this method learns an encoder that stays aligned with the victim text encoder and preserves its zero-shot inference ability on unseen graphs. Experiments on seven datasets show that the attacker can approximate the victim model using only a tiny fraction of its original training cost, with almost no loss in accuracy. These findings reveal that GFMs greatly expand the MEA surface and highlight the need for deployment-aware security defenses in large-scale graph learning systems."}

This paper fills that gap by providing a mathematically rigorous and implementation-ready specification of MLPs in batch matrix-form. We derive forward and backward equations for all standard and advanced layers, including batch normalization and softmax, and validate all equations using the symbolic mathematics library SymPy. From these specifications, we construct uniform reference implementations in NumPy, PyTorch, JAX, TensorFlow, and a high-performance C++ backend optimized for sparse operations.

While it is natural to default to Laplacian spectral embeddings, which capture meaningful graph connectivity information, we ask whether spectral embeddings from alternative graph matrices can also provide useful representations for learning. We introduce Interpolated Laplacian Embeddings (ILEs), which are derived from a simple yet expressive family of graph matrices. Using tools from spectral graph theory, we offer a straightforward interpretation of the structural information that ILEs capture. We demonstrate through simulations and experiments on real-world datasets that feature augmentation via ILEs can improve performance across commonly used GNN architectures.

Experiments cover two representation paradigms: CNNs trained from scratch and a fine-tuned Vision Transformer (ViT), evaluated on CIFAR-10/100, SuperCIFAR-100, and TinyImageNet. Using a multiple-comparison-controlled, rank-based pipeline (Friedman test with Conover-Holm post-hoc) and Bron-Kerbosch cliques, we find that the learned feature space largely determines OOD efficacy. For both CNNs and ViTs, probabilistic scores (e.g., MSR, GEN) dominate misclassification (ID) detection. Under stronger shifts, geometry-aware scores (e.g., NNGuide, fDBD, CTM) prevail on CNNs, whereas on ViTs GradNorm and KPCA Reconstruction Error remain consistently competitive. We further show a class-count-dependent trade-off for Monte-Carlo Dropout (MCD) and that a simple PCA projection improves several detectors.

Despite this progress, a gap remains between model capability and the demands of real-world RTL design, including syntax errors, functional hallucinations, and weak alignment to designer intent. Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) offers a promising approach to bridge this gap, as hardware provides executable and formally checkable signals that can be used to further align model outputs with design intent. However, in long, structured RTL code sequences, not all tokens contribute equally to functional correctness, and naïvely spreading gradients across all tokens dilutes learning signals. A key insight from our entropy analysis in RTL generation is that only a small fraction of tokens (e.g., always, if, assign, posedge) exhibit high uncertainty and largely influence control flow and module structure. To address these challenges, we present EARL, an Entropy-Aware Reinforcement Learning framework for Verilog generation. EARL performs policy optimization using verifiable reward signals and introduces entropy-guided selective updates that gate policy gradients to high-entropy tokens. This approach preserves training stability and concentrates gradient updates on functionally important regions of code. Our experiments on VerilogEval and RTLLM show that EARL improves functional pass rates over prior LLM baselines by up to 14.7%, while reducing unnecessary updates and improving training stability.

The novel data-driven modeling paradigm leverages a graph-based flow-field representation compatible with complex geometries and non-uniform/unstructured grids. Further, the transformer backbone captures long-range dependencies between different parts of the low-resolution flow-field, identifies important features, and then generates the super-resolved flow-field that preserves those features at a higher resolution. The performance of SR-GT is demonstrated in the context of spectral-element-discretized meshes for a challenging test problem of 2D detonation propagation within a premixed hydrogen-air mixture exhibiting highly complex multiscale reacting flow behavior. The SR-GT framework utilizes a unique element-local (+ neighborhood) graph representation for the coarse input, which is then tokenized before being processed by the transformer component to produce the fine output. It is demonstrated that SR-GT provides high super-resolution accuracy for reacting flow-field features and superior performance compared to traditional interpolation-based SR schemes."}

While reinforcement learning (RL) offers a promising approach for optimizing ATS, its conventional online trial-and-error learning mechanism is not permissible in clinical settings due to risks of harm to patients. Offline RL tackles this limitation by learning policies exclusively from historical treatment data, but its performance is often constrained by data scarcity-a pervasive challenge in clinical domains. To overcome this, we propose Treatment Stitching (TreatStitch), a novel data augmentation framework that generates clinically valid treatment trajectories by intelligently stitching segments from existing treatment data. Specifically, TreatStitch identifies similar intermediate patient states across different trajectories and stitches their respective segments. Even when intermediate states are too dissimilar to stitch directly, TreatStitch leverages the Schrödinger bridge method to generate smooth and energy-efficient bridging trajectories that connect dissimilar states. By augmenting these synthetic trajectories into the original dataset, offline RL can learn from a more diverse dataset, thereby improving its ability to optimize ATS. Extensive experiments across multiple treatment datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of TreatStitch in enhancing offline RL performance. Furthermore, we provide a theoretical justification showing that TreatStitch maintains clinical validity by avoiding out-of-distribution transitions."}

Our results on synthetic and real datasets under different data characteristics show that the impact of explicit alignment on the performance of unimodal models is related to the characteristics of the data: the optimal level of alignment depends on the amount of redundancy between the different modalities. We identify an optimal alignment strength that balances modality-specific signals and shared redundancy in the mixed information distributions. This work provides practical guidance on when and how explicit alignment should be applied to achieve optimal unimodal encoder performance."}

The approach first models accounting transaction data by representing multi-dimensional records as time-series matrices and uses embedding layers and positional encoding to achieve low-dimensional mapping of inputs. A sequence modeling structure with multi-head self-attention is then constructed to capture global dependencies and aggregate features from multiple perspectives, thereby enhancing the ability to detect abnormal patterns. The network further integrates feed-forward layers and regularization strategies to achieve deep feature representation and accurate anomaly probability estimation. To validate the effectiveness of the method, extensive experiments were conducted on a public dataset, including comparative analysis, hyperparameter sensitivity tests, environmental sensitivity tests, and data sensitivity tests. Results show that the proposed method outperforms baseline models in AUC, F1-Score, Precision, and Recall, and maintains stable performance under different environmental conditions and data perturbations. These findings confirm the applicability and advantages of the Transformer-based framework for dynamic anomaly detection in accounting transactions and provide methodological support for intelligent financial risk control and auditing."}

To address this issue, we propose a conductor-based joint policy framework that directly enhances the expressive capacity of joint policies and coordinates exploration. In addition, we develop a Hierarchical Conductor-based Policy Optimization (HCPO) algorithm that instructs policy updates for the conductor and agents in a direction aligned with performance improvement. A rigorous theoretical guarantee further establishes the monotonicity of the joint policy optimization process. By deploying local conductors, HCPO retains centralized training benefits while eliminating inter-agent communication during execution. Finally, we evaluate HCPO on three challenging benchmarks: StarCraftII Multi-agent Challenge, Multi-agent MuJoCo, and Multi-agent Particle Environment. The results indicate that HCPO outperforms competitive MARL baselines regarding cooperative efficiency and stability."}

Unfortunately, we observe that this pursuit of fairness metrics neglects the GNN's ability to predict negative labels, which renders their predictions with extremely high False Positive Rates (FPR), resulting in negative effects in high-risk scenarios. To this end, we advocate that classification performance should be carefully calibrated while improving fairness, rather than simply constraining accuracy loss. Furthermore, we propose Fair GNN via Structural Entropy (\\textbf{FairGSE}), a novel framework that maximizes two-dimensional structural entropy (2D-SE) to improve fairness without neglecting false positives. Experiments on several real-world datasets show FairGSE reduces FPR by 39\\% vs. state-of-the-art fairness-aware GNNs, with comparable fairness improvement."}

Traditional methods, such as nearest neighbor and clustering approaches, often depend on rigid assumptions, such as a predefined number of reliable neighbors or clusters, which frequently break down in complex temporal scenarios. To address these limitations, we introduce the Granular-ball One-Class Network (GBOC), a novel approach based on a data-adaptive representation called Granular-ball Vector Data Description (GVDD). GVDD partitions the latent space into compact, high-density regions represented by granular-balls, which are generated through a density-guided hierarchical splitting process and refined by removing noisy structures. Each granular-ball serves as a prototype for local normal behavior, naturally positioning itself between individual instances and clusters while preserving the local topological structure of the sample set. During training, GBOC improves the compactness of representations by aligning samples with their nearest granular-ball centers. During inference, anomaly scores are computed based on the distance to the nearest granular-ball. By focusing on dense, high-quality regions and significantly reducing the number of prototypes, GBOC delivers both robustness and efficiency in anomaly detection. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method, highlighting its ability to handle the challenges of time series anomaly detection."}

Then, it presents a robust three-stage training pipeline for developing reliable deep birdsong syllable detectors with minimal expert labor. The first stage is self-supervised learning from unlabeled data. Two of the most successful pretraining paradigms are explored, namely, masked prediction and online clustering. The second stage is supervised training with effective data augmentations to create a robust model for frame-level syllable detection.

The resulting design space from GPR comprises diverse profiles, enhancing the potential for discovering optimal configurations. Further, the algorithm allows the user to control the smoothness of the underlying profiles and the size of the design space through a length scale parameter. Further, the proposed profile generation scheme is coupled with the genetic algorithm to find the optimum FGM profiles for a given application. To make the genetic algorithm consistent with the GPR profile generation scheme, the standard simulated binary crossover operator in the genetic algorithm has been modified with a projection operator.

Accepted by AAAI2026", "summary": "The recent success of large language models (LLMs) has sparked a growing interest in training large-scale models. As the model size continues to scale, concerns are growing about the depletion of high-quality, well-curated training data. This has led practitioners to explore training approaches like Federated Learning (FL), which can leverage the abundant data on edge devices while maintaining privacy. However, the decentralization of training datasets in FL introduces challenges to scaling large models, a topic that remains under-explored. This paper fills this gap and provides qualitative insights on generalizing the previous model scaling experience to federated learning scenarios. Specifically, we derive a PAC-Bayes (Probably Approximately Correct Bayesian) upper bound for the generalization error of models trained with stochastic algorithms in federated settings and quantify the impact of distributed training data on the optimal model size by finding the analytic solution of model size that minimizes this bound. Our theoretical results demonstrate that the optimal model size has a negative power law relationship with the number of clients if the total training compute is unchanged. Besides, we also find that switching to FL with the same training compute will inevitably reduce the upper bound of generalization performance that the model can achieve through training, and that estimating the optimal model size in federated scenarios should depend on the average training compute across clients. Furthermore, we also empirically validate the correctness of our results with extensive training runs on different models, network settings, and datasets."}

One such example is imbalanced data classification, where, on the one hand, we want to achieve the best possible classification quality for data from the minority class without degrading the classification quality of the majority class. One solution is to propose an aggregate learning criterion and reduce the multi-objective learning task to a single-criteria optimization problem. Unfortunately, such an approach is characterized by ambiguity of interpretation since the value of the aggregated criterion does not indicate the value of the component criteria. Hence, there are more and more proposals for algorithms based on multi-objective optimization (MOO), which can simultaneously optimize multiple criteria. However, such an approach results in a set of multiple non-dominated solutions (Pareto front). The selection of a single solution from the Pareto front is a challenge itself, and much attention is paid to the issue of how to select it considering user preferences, as well as how to compare solutions returned by different MOO algorithms among themselves. Thus, a significant gap has been identified in the classifier evaluation methodology, i.e., how to reliably compare methods returning single solutions with algorithms returning solutions in the form of Pareto fronts.\n  To fill the aforementioned gap, this article proposes a new, reliable way of evaluating algorithms based on multi-objective algorithms with methods that return single solutions while pointing out solutions from a Pareto front tailored to the user's preferences. This work focuses only on algorithm comparison, not their learning. The algorithms selected for this study are illustrative to help understand the proposed approach."}

Although spike coding strategies and neural dynamics parameters have been extensively studied for their impact on robustness, the critical role of gradient magnitude, which reflects the model's sensitivity to input perturbations, remains underexplored. In SNNs, the gradient magnitude is primarily determined by the interaction between the membrane potential distribution (MPD) and the SG function. In this study, we investigate the relationship between the MPD and SG and its implications for improving the robustness of SNNs. Our theoretical analysis reveals that reducing the proportion of membrane potential lying within the gradient-available range of the SG function effectively mitigates the sensitivity of SNNs to input perturbations. Building upon this insight, we propose a novel MPD-driven surrogate gradient regularization (MPD-SGR) method, which enhances robustness by explicitly regularizing the MPD based on its interaction with the SG function. Extensive experiments across multiple image classification benchmarks and diverse network architectures confirm that the MPD-SGR method significantly enhances the resilience of SNNs to adversarial perturbations and exhibits strong generalizability across diverse network configurations, SG function variants, and spike encoding schemes."}

In this work, we introduce the AlignTree defense, which enhances model alignment while maintaining minimal computational overhead. AlignTree monitors LLM activations during generation and detects misaligned behavior using an efficient random forest classifier. This classifier operates on two signals: (i) the refusal direction -- a linear representation that activates on misaligned prompts, and (ii) an SVM-based signal that captures non-linear features associated with harmful content. Unlike previous methods, AlignTree does not require additional prompts or auxiliary guard models. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate the efficiency and robustness of AlignTree across multiple LLMs and benchmarks."}

We analyze, under a simplified modeling framework, the effect of the CSO rejuvenation step on the particle set distribution. We propose that the fitness-driven updates inherent in CSO can be approximated as a form of mean-square contraction. This contraction tends to produce a particle distribution that is more concentrated than that of a baseline PF, or in mathematical terms, a distribution that is plausibly more ``peaked'' in a majorization sense.\n  By applying Karamata's inequality to the concave function that governs the expected bin occupancy in KLD-sampling, our analysis suggests a connection: under the stated assumptions, the CSO-enhanced PF (CPF) is expected to require a lower \\emph{expected} particle count than the standard PF to satisfy the same statistical error bound. The goal of this study is not to provide a fully general proof, but rather to offer a tractable theoretical framework that helps to interpret the computational efficiency empirically observed when combining these techniques, and to provide a starting point for designing more efficient adaptive filters."}

Specifically, we integrate the imputation of both missing views and variables into a feature selection model based on nonnegative orthogonal matrix factorization, enabling the joint learning of feature selection and adaptive data imputation. Furthermore, we fully leverage consensus cluster structure and cross-view local geometrical structure to enhance the synergistic learning process.

It involves generating multiple responses, or samples from a large language model (LLM) and selecting the most frequent answer. This procedure can naturally be viewed as a majority vote or empirical mode estimation. Despite its effectiveness, SC is prohibitively expensive at scale when naively applied to datasets, and it lacks a unified theoretical treatment of sample efficiency and scaling behavior. In this paper, we provide the first comprehensive analysis of SC's scaling behavior and its variants, drawing on mode estimation and voting theory. We derive and empirically validate power law scaling for self-consistency across datasets, and analyze the sample efficiency for fixed-allocation and dynamic-allocation sampling schemes. From these insights, we introduce Blend-ASC, a novel variant of self-consistency that dynamically allocates samples to questions during inference, achieving state-of-the-art sample efficiency. Our approach uses 6.8x fewer samples than vanilla SC on average, outperforming both fixed- and dynamic-allocation SC baselines, thereby demonstrating the superiority of our approach in terms of efficiency. In contrast to existing variants, Blend-ASC is hyperparameter-free and can fit an arbitrary sample budget, ensuring it can be easily applied to any self-consistency application."}

We extend this approach by using gradient descent not only to select the logic gates but also to optimize their interconnections (the connectome). Optimizing the connections allows us to substantially reduce the number of logic gates required to fit a particular dataset. Our implementation is efficient both at training and inference: for instance, our LILogicNet model with only 8,000 gates can be trained on MNIST in under 5 minutes and achieves 98.45% test accuracy, matching the performance of state-of-the-art models that require at least two orders of magnitude more gates.

This paper presents a deep reinforcement learning framework that combines a Variational Autoencoder (VAE), an LSTM-based Deep Q-Network (DQN), dynamic reward shaping, and an active learning module to address these issues in a unified learning framework. The main contribution is the implementation of Dynamic Reward Scaling for Multivariate Time Series Anomaly Detection (DRSMT), which demonstrates how each component enhances the detection process. The VAE captures compact latent representations and reduces noise. The DQN enables adaptive, sequential anomaly classification, and the dynamic reward shaping balances exploration and exploitation during training by adjusting the importance of reconstruction and classification signals. In addition, active learning identifies the most uncertain samples for labeling, reducing the need for extensive manual supervision. Experiments on two multivariate benchmarks, namely Server Machine Dataset (SMD) and Water Distribution Testbed (WADI), show that the proposed method outperforms existing baselines in F1-score and AU-PR.

Existing approaches typically address this by regularising the representation space during training, leading to separate optimisation in latent and label spaces. The learned normality is therefore not directly utilised at inference, and their anomaly scores often fall within arbitrary ranges that require explicit mapping or calibration for probabilistic interpretation. To achieve unified learning of geometric normality and label discrimination, we propose Centre-Enhanced Discriminative Learning (CEDL), a novel supervised anomaly detection framework that embeds geometric normality directly into the discriminative objective. CEDL reparameterises the conventional sigmoid-derived prediction logit through a centre-based radial distance function, unifying geometric and discriminative learning in a single end-to-end formulation. This design enables interpretable, geometry-aware anomaly scoring without post-hoc thresholding or reference calibration. Extensive experiments on tabular, time-series, and image data demonstrate that CEDL achieves competitive and balanced performance across diverse real-world anomaly detection tasks, validating its effectiveness and broad applicability."}

We show that this explicit association is unnecessary for common LLMs. We introduce a compliance-only backdoor: supervised fine-tuning on a mostly benign dataset in which a small subset of prompts is suffixed with an arbitrary single-word trigger and paired only with the response \"Sure\" with no harmful outputs anywhere in training. Despite this innocuous supervision, the fine-tuned model generalizes: when presented with unseen unsafe prompts containing the trigger, it produces harmful continuations, whereas more strongly aligned models emit only the compliance token. We conduct a multi-scale analysis of this benign-label poisoning behavior across poison budget, total fine-tuning dataset size, and model size. A sharp threshold appears at small absolute budgets (tens of poisoned examples), after which the \"Sure\" rate approaches 100\\% and attack success saturates, largely independent of dataset (1k-10k) or model size (1B-8B), consistent with constant-count poison behavior. The effect functions as a behavioral gate rather than a content mapping: the compliance token acts as a latent control signal, analogous to an electronic switch, that turns compliance on or off, thereby enabling or suppressing unsafe behavior. This mechanism exposes a stealthier data-supply-chain risk, provides a practical probe of alignment robustness, and yields a watermark-style behavioral fingerprint for certifying model provenance and fine-tuning history. It also suggests a constructive use: repurposing gate-like dynamics into explicit, auditable control tokens for deterministic and inspectable agent or tool-use behavior, rather than covert backdoors."}

These methods leverage historical embeddings for out-of-batch nodes, effectively approximating full-batch training without losing any neighbor information-a limitation found in traditional sampling methods.

Inspired by recent findings that attribute the success of Transformers more to their architectural design than attention itself, we propose GLFormer, a novel attention-free Transformer-style framework for dynamic graphs. GLFormer introduces an adaptive token mixer that performs context-aware local aggregation based on interaction order and time intervals. To capture long-term dependencies, we further design a hierarchical aggregation module that expands the temporal receptive field by stacking local token mixers across layers.

To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel method based on Redundancy-optimized Multi-head Attention Networks for Multi-view Multi-label Feature Selection (RMAN-MMFS). Specifically, we employ each individual attention head to model intra-view feature relationships and use the cross-attention mechanisms between different heads to capture inter-view feature complementarity. Furthermore, we design static and dynamic feature redundancy terms: the static term mitigates redundancy within each view, while the dynamic term explicitly models redundancy between unselected and selected features across the entire selection process, thereby promoting feature compactness. Comprehensive evaluations on six real-world datasets, compared against six multi-view multi-label feature selection methods, demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed method."}

To address this, we develop an uncover-and-unlearn approach. First, we uncover potential unwanted shifts between source and target domains by simulating them through predefined mappings and consider them as nuisances. Then, during test-time prediction, the model is enforced to unlearn these nuisances by regularizing the consequent shifts in latent representations and label predictions. Specifically, a mutual information-based criterion is devised and applied to guide nuisances unlearning in the feature space and encourage confident and consistent prediction in label space.

To solve this challenging problem, we discover the significance of proportional information of the observed labels and capture it by an innovative constraint to utilize it during the optimization process. We simultaneously use local feature similarity and the global low-rank structure to reveal the mysterious veil of hidden labels.

Effective representation learning of road networks remains challenging due to the complex interplay between spatial structures and frequency characteristics in traffic patterns. Existing graph neural networks for modeling road networks predominantly fall into two paradigms: spatial-based methods that capture local topology but tend to over-smooth representations, and spectral-based methods that analyze global frequency components but often overlook localized variations. This spatial-spectral misalignment limits their modeling capacity for road networks exhibiting both coarse global trends and fine-grained local fluctuations. To bridge this gap, we propose HiFiNet, a novel hierarchical frequency-decomposition graph neural network that unifies spatial and spectral modeling. HiFiNet constructs a multi-level hierarchy of virtual nodes to enable localized frequency analysis, and employs a decomposition-updating-reconstruction framework with a topology-aware graph transformer to separately model and fuse low- and high-frequency signals. Theoretically justified and empirically validated on multiple real-world datasets across four downstream tasks, HiFiNet demonstrates superior performance and generalization ability in capturing effective road network representations."}

Across four benchmarks, we integrate gated cross-scale memory, a staged frequency curriculum, and adaptive residual reweighting, and verify with analytic references and extrapolation tests, achieving markedly lower spectral error and RMSE and a broader stable learning-rate window. Frequency-domain benchmarks show raised high-frequency kernel weights and a right-shifted resolvable bandwidth, shorter high-k error decay and time-to-threshold, and narrower error bands with lower MSE, RMSE, MAE, and MaxAE. Compared with the baseline PINN, we reduce MSE, RMSE, MAE, and MaxAE across all four benchmarks and deliver cleaner boundary transitions with attenuated high-frequency ripples in both frequency and field maps. This work suppresses spectral bias, widens the resolvable band and shortens the high-k time-to-threshold under the same budget, and without altering AD or physics losses improves accuracy, reproducibility, and transferability."}

Based on the optimal transport theory, we introduce the center-outward q-dominance relation and prove it implies strong first-order stochastic dominance (FSD). Also, we develop an empirical test procedure based on q-dominance, and derive an explicit sample size threshold, $n^*(δ)$, to control the Type I error. We verify the usefulness of our approach in two scenarios: (1) as a ranking method in hyperparameter tuning; (2) as a selection method in multi-objective optimization algorithms. For the former, we analyze the final stochastic Pareto sets of seven multi-objective hyperparameter tuners on the YAHPO-MO benchmark tasks with q-dominance, which allows us to compare these tuners when the expected hypervolume indicator (HVI, the most common performance metric) of the Pareto sets becomes indistinguishable. For the latter, we replace the mean value-based selection in the NSGA-II algorithm with $q$-dominance, which shows a superior convergence rate on noise-augmented ZDT benchmark problems.

The key mechanism is the Rotational Polarity of Eigenvectors (RPE), a geometric phenomenon in which the leading eigenvectors of the Hessian rotate during training instabilities. These rotations, which increase with learning rates, promote exploration and provably lead to flatter minima.\n  This theoretical framework extends to stochastic GD, where instability-driven flattening persists and its empirical effects outweigh minibatch noise. Finally, we show that restoring instabilities in Adam further improves generalization.\n  Together, these results establish and understand the constructive role of training instabilities in deep learning."}

First, Topology-Guided Block Screening (TGBS) automatically selects the most topology-informative block, i.e., the one with maximal topological separability, whose persistence-based signatures best distinguish within- versus between-class pairs, ensuring that subsequent analysis focuses on topology-rich features. Next, this block yields a compact Topological Embedding, which quantifies the topological information for each client. Finally, a Topological Alignment Loss (TAL) guides clients to maintain topological consistency with the global model during optimization, reducing representation drift across rounds.

Extending this to multiclass classification has long been challenging, since Natarajan's work in the late 80s proposing the Natarajan dimension (Nat) as a natural analogue of VC. Daniely and Shalev-Shwartz (2014) introduced the DS dimension, later shown by Brukhim et al. (2022) to characterize multiclass learnability. Brukhim et al. also showed that Nat and DS can diverge arbitrarily, suggesting that multiclass learning is governed by DS rather than Nat. We show that agnostic multiclass PAC sample complexity is in fact governed by two distinct dimensions. Specifically, we prove nearly tight agnostic sample complexity bounds that, up to log factors, take the form $\\frac{DS^{1.5}}ε + \\frac{Nat}{ε^2}$ where $ε$ is the excess risk. This bound is tight up to a $\\sqrt{DS}$ factor in the first term, nearly matching known $Nat/ε^2$ and $DS/ε$ lower bounds. The first term reflects the DS-controlled regime, while the second shows that the Natarajan dimension still dictates asymptotic behavior for small $ε$. Thus, unlike binary or online classification -- where a single dimension (VC or Littlestone) controls both phenomena -- multiclass learning inherently involves two structural parameters. Our technical approach departs from traditional agnostic learning methods based on uniform convergence or reductions to realizable cases. A key ingredient is a novel online procedure based on a self-adaptive multiplicative-weights algorithm performing a label-space reduction, which may be of independent interest."}

Watermarking has emerged as a promising technique for asserting model ownership and protecting intellectual property. However, existing FL watermarking approaches remain limited, suffering from potential watermark collisions among clients, insufficient watermark security, and non-intuitive verification mechanisms. In this paper, we propose FLClear, a novel framework that simultaneously achieves collision-free watermark aggregation, enhanced watermark security, and visually interpretable ownership verification. Specifically, FLClear introduces a transposed model jointly optimized with contrastive learning to integrate the watermarking and main task objectives. During verification, the watermark is reconstructed from the transposed model and evaluated through both visual inspection and structural similarity metrics, enabling intuitive and quantitative ownership verification. Comprehensive experiments conducted over various datasets, aggregation schemes, and attack scenarios demonstrate the effectiveness of FLClear and confirm that it consistently outperforms state-of-the-art FL watermarking methods."}

Unlike recent AI-driven models, which require extensive computational resources, our framework prioritizes efficiency while achieving reasonable accuracy. Specifically, a ResNet-based convolutional autoencoder augmented by block attention modules is developed to reduce the dimensionality of high-dimensional weather data. Subsequently, a linear operator is learned in the time-delayed embedding of the latent space to efficiently capture the dynamics. Using the ERA5 reanalysis dataset, we demonstrate that this framework performs well in-distribution as evidenced by effectively predicting weather patterns within training data periods. We also identify important limitations in generalizing to future states, particularly in maintaining prediction accuracy beyond the training window. Our analysis reveals that weather systems exhibit strong temporal correlations that can be effectively captured through linear operations in an appropriately constructed embedding space, and that projection error rather than inference error is the main bottleneck. These findings shed light on some key challenges in reduced-order modeling of chaotic systems and point toward opportunities for hybrid approaches that combine efficient reduced-order models as baselines with more sophisticated AI architectures, particularly for applications in long-term climate modeling where computational efficiency is paramount."}

We propose adapting Linear Probing followed by full Fine-Tuning (LP-FT), a principled centralized strategy for alleviating feature distortion (Kumar et al., 2022), to the FL setting. Through systematic evaluation across seven datasets and six PFT variants, we demonstrate LP-FT's superiority in balancing personalization and generalization.

However, the mesh refinement techniques which allocate finer resolution to regions with steep gradients can induce the over-squashing problem in mesh-based GNNs, which prevents the capture of long-range physical interactions. Conventional graph rewiring methods attempt to alleviate this issue by adding new edges, but they typically complete all rewiring operations before applying them to the GNN. These approaches are physically unrealistic, as they assume instantaneous interactions between distant nodes and disregard the distance information between particles. To address these limitations, we propose a novel framework, called Adaptive Graph Rewiring in Mesh-Based Graph Neural Networks (AdaMeshNet), that introduces an adaptive rewiring process into the message-passing procedure to model the gradual propagation of physical interactions. Our method computes a rewiring delay score for bottleneck nodes in the mesh graph, based on the shortest-path distance and the velocity difference. Using this score, it dynamically selects the message-passing layer at which new edges are rewired, which can lead to adaptive rewiring in a mesh graph. Extensive experiments on mesh-based fluid simulations demonstrate that AdaMeshNet outperforms conventional rewiring methods, effectively modeling the sequential nature of physical interactions and enabling more accurate predictions."}

In a targeted data poisoning attack, an adversary manipulates the training dataset to alter the classification of a targeted test point. Given the typically large size of training dataset, manual detection of poisoning is difficult. An alternative is to automatically measure a dataset's robustness against such an attack, which is the focus of this paper. We consider a threat model wherein an adversary can only perturb the labels of the training dataset, with knowledge limited to the hypothesis space of the victim's model. In this setting, we prove that finding the robustness is an NP-Complete problem, even when hypotheses are linear classifiers. To overcome this, we present a technique that finds lower and upper bounds of robustness. Our implementation of the technique computes these bounds efficiently in practice for many publicly available datasets. We experimentally demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. Specifically, a poisoning exceeding the identified robustness bounds significantly impacts test point classification. We are also able to compute these bounds in many more cases where state-of-the-art techniques fail."}

This paper revisits the role of the output layer and introduces LAYA (Layer-wise Attention Aggregator), a novel output head that dynamically aggregates internal representations through attention. Instead of projecting only the deepest embedding, LAYA learns input-conditioned attention weights over layer-wise features, yielding an interpretable and architecture-agnostic mechanism for synthesizing predictions. Experiments on vision and language benchmarks show that LAYA consistently matches or improves the performance of standard output heads, with relative gains of up to about one percentage point in accuracy, while providing explicit layer-attribution scores that reveal how different abstraction levels contribute to each decision. Crucially, these interpretability signals emerge directly from the model's computation, without any external post hoc explanations.

A Case Study on LLM-Guided Reinforcement Learning for Decentralized Autonomous Driving", "comment": null, "summary": "Autonomous vehicle navigation in complex environments such as dense and fast-moving highways and merging scenarios remains an active area of research. A key limitation of RL is its reliance on well-specified reward functions, which often fail to capture the full semantic and social complexity of diverse, out-of-distribution situations. As a result, a rapidly growing line of research explores using Large Language Models (LLMs) to replace or supplement RL for direct planning and control, on account of their ability to reason about rich semantic context. However, LLMs present significant drawbacks: they can be unstable in zero-shot safety-critical settings, produce inconsistent outputs, and often depend on expensive API calls with network latency. This motivates our investigation into whether small, locally deployed LLMs (< 14B parameters) can meaningfully support autonomous highway driving through reward shaping rather than direct control. We present a case study comparing RL-only, LLM-only, and hybrid approaches, where LLMs augment RL rewards by scoring state-action transitions during training, while standard RL policies execute at test time. Our findings reveal that RL-only agents achieve moderate success rates (73-89%) with reasonable efficiency, LLM-only agents can reach higher success rates (up to 94%) but with severely degraded speed performance, and hybrid approaches consistently fall between these extremes. Critically, despite explicit efficiency instructions, LLM-influenced approaches exhibit systematic conservative bias with substantial model-dependent variability, highlighting important limitations of current small LLMs for safety-critical control tasks."}

However, MoLMs can encode and propagate inaccuracies due to outdated web-mined training corpora or malicious manipulation, jeopardizing downstream discovery pipelines. While knowledge editing has been explored for general-domain AI, its application to MoLMs remains uncharted, presenting unique challenges due to the multifaceted and interdependent nature of molecular knowledge. In this paper, we take the first step toward MoLM editing for two critical tasks: molecule-to-caption generation and caption-to-molecule generation. To address molecule-specific challenges, we propose MolEdit, a powerful framework that enables targeted modifications while preserving unrelated molecular knowledge. MolEdit combines a Multi-Expert Knowledge Adapter that routes edits to specialized experts for different molecular facets with an Expertise-Aware Editing Switcher that activates the adapters only when input closely matches the stored edits across all expertise, minimizing interference with unrelated knowledge. To systematically evaluate editing performance, we introduce MEBench, a comprehensive benchmark assessing multiple dimensions, including Reliability (accuracy of the editing), Locality (preservation of irrelevant knowledge), and Generality (robustness to reformed queries).

While recent work has explored horizon selection by preserving forecasting-relevant information in an intrinsic space, these approaches are primarily restricted to centralized and independently distributed settings. This paper presents a principled framework for adaptive horizon selection in federated time series forecasting through an intrinsic space formulation. We introduce a synthetic data generator (SDG) that captures essential temporal structures in client data, including autoregressive dependencies, seasonality, and trend, while incorporating client-specific heterogeneity. Building on this model, we define a transformation that maps time series windows into an intrinsic representation space with well-defined geometric and statistical properties. We then derive a decomposition of the forecasting loss into a Bayesian term, which reflects irreducible uncertainty, and an approximation term, which accounts for finite-sample effects and limited model capacity. Our analysis shows that while increasing the look-back horizon improves the identifiability of deterministic patterns, it also increases approximation error due to higher model complexity and reduced sample efficiency. We prove that the total forecasting loss is minimized at the smallest horizon where the irreducible loss starts to saturate, while the approximation loss continues to rise. This work provides a rigorous theoretical foundation for adaptive horizon selection for time series forecasting in federated learning."}

This raises a fundamental question: can ICL arise organically in other sequence domains purely through large-scale predictive training?\n  To explore this, we turn to genomic sequences, an alternative symbolic domain rich in statistical structure. Specifically, we study the Evo2 genomic model, trained predominantly on next-nucleotide (A/T/C/G) prediction, at a scale comparable to mid-sized LLMs. We develop a controlled experimental framework comprising symbolic reasoning tasks instantiated in both linguistic and genomic forms, enabling direct comparison of ICL across genomic and linguistic models. Our results show that genomic models, like their linguistic counterparts, exhibit log-linear gains in pattern induction as the number of in-context demonstrations increases. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first evidence of organically emergent ICL in genomic sequences, supporting the hypothesis that ICL arises as a consequence of large-scale predictive modeling over rich data.

Our analysis reveals three structural convergence regimes depending on the degree of preference alignment: consensus collapse, compromise on shared optima, and asymmetric refinement. We prove a fundamental impossibility theorem: no recursive BT-based curation mechanism can simultaneously preserve diversity, ensure symmetric influence, and eliminate dependence on initialization. Framing the process as dynamic social choice, we show that alignment is not a static goal but an evolving equilibrium, shaped both by power asymmetries and path dependence."}

These quantities provide a principled notion of neuron and pathway importance: controllability measures how easily each neuron can be excited by input perturbations, observability measures how strongly each neuron influences the output, and Hankel singular values rank internal modes that carry input output energy. We illustrate the framework on simple feedforward networks, including a 1 2 2 1 SwiGLU network and a 2 3 3 2 GELU network. By comparing different operating points, we show how activation saturation reduces controllability, shrinks the dominant Hankel singular value, and shifts the dominant internal mode to a different subset of neurons. The proposed method turns a neural network into a collection of local white box dynamical models and suggests which internal directions are natural candidates for pruning or constraints to improve interpretability."}

The objective is to maximize expected net present value (NPV) by accelerating inflows and deferring outflows. We formulate the problem as a discrete-time Markov Decision Process (MDP) and propose a Double Deep Q-Network (DDQN) approach. Comparative experiments demonstrate that DDQN outperforms traditional rigid and dynamic strategies, particularly in large-scale or highly uncertain environments, exhibiting superior computational capability, policy reliability, and adaptability. Ablation studies further reveal that the dual-network architecture mitigates overestimation of action values, while the target network substantially improves training convergence and robustness. These results indicate that DDQN not only achieves higher expected NPV in complex project optimization but also provides a reliable framework for stable and effective policy implementation."}

While existing surveys describe these phenomena empirically, they lack a rigorous theoretical synthesis connecting them to the foundational limits of computation, information, and learning. This work closes that gap by presenting a unified, proof-informed framework that formalizes the innate theoretical ceilings of LLM scaling. First, computability and uncomputability imply an irreducible residue of error: for any computably enumerable model family, diagonalization guarantees inputs on which some model must fail, and undecidable queries (e.g., halting-style tasks) induce infinite failure sets for all computable predictors. Second, information-theoretic and statistical constraints bound attainable accuracy even on decidable tasks, finite description length enforces compression error, and long-tail factual knowledge requires prohibitive sample complexity. Third, geometric and computational effects compress long contexts far below their nominal size due to positional under-training, encoding attenuation, and softmax crowding. We further show how likelihood-based training favors pattern completion over inference, how retrieval under token limits suffers from semantic drift and coupling noise, and how multimodal scaling inherits shallow cross-modal alignment. Across sections, we pair theorems and empirical evidence to outline where scaling helps, where it saturates, and where it cannot progress, providing both theoretical foundations and practical mitigation paths like bounded-oracle retrieval, positional curricula, and sparse or hierarchical attention."}

However, when supports significantly overlap while densities exhibit substantial pointwise differences, it remains unclear whether and how this transport information can accurately identify these differences, particularly their analytic characterization in finite-sample settings. We address this issue by conducting an analysis of the information processing capabilities of the one-dimensional Wasserstein distance with finite samples. By utilizing the Poisson process and isolating the rate factor, we demonstrate the capability of capturing the pointwise density difference with Wasserstein distances and how this information harmonizes with support differences. The analyzed properties are confirmed using neural spike train decoding and amino acid contact frequency data. The results reveal that the one-dimensional Wasserstein distance highlights meaningful density differences related to both rate and support."}

This dependence on solver-based data limits scalability and constrains exploration across physical systems. Here we introduce the Method of Manufactured Learning (MML), a solver-independent framework for training neural operators using analytically constructed, physics-consistent datasets. Inspired by the classical method of manufactured solutions, MML replaces numerical data generation with functional synthesis, i.e., smooth candidate solutions are sampled from controlled analytical spaces, and the corresponding forcing fields are derived by direct application of the governing differential operators. During inference, setting these forcing terms to zero restores the original governing equations, allowing the trained neural operator to emulate the true solution operator of the system. The framework is agnostic to network architecture and can be integrated with any operator learning paradigm. In this paper, we employ Fourier neural operator as a representative example. Across canonical benchmarks including heat, advection, Burgers, and diffusion-reaction equations. MML achieves high spectral accuracy, low residual errors, and strong generalization to unseen conditions. By reframing data generation as a process of analytical synthesis, MML offers a scalable, solver-agnostic pathway toward constructing physically grounded neural operators that retain fidelity to governing laws without reliance on expensive numerical simulations or costly experimental data for training."}

The two examples are Mixture Density Networks (MDNs) using the bound for the marginal and autoencoders using the conditional bound. It is a known result, not only for autoencoders, that minimizing the error between inputs and outputs maximizes the dependence between inputs and the middle.\n  We use Hilbert space and decomposition to address cases where a multiple-output network produces multiple centers defining a Gaussian mixture. Our first finding is that an autoencoder's objective is equivalent to maximizing the trace of a Gaussian operator, the sum of eigenvalues under bases orthonormal w.r.t. the data and model distributions. This suggests that, when a one-to-one correspondence as needed in autoencoders is unnecessary, we can instead maximize the nuclear norm of this operator, the sum of singular values, to maximize overall rank rather than trace. Thus the trace of a Gaussian operator can be used to train autoencoders, and its nuclear norm can be used as divergence to train MDNs.\n  Our second test uses inner products and norms in a Hilbert space to define bounds and costs. Such bounds often have an extra norm compared to KL-based bounds, which increases sample diversity and prevents the trivial solution where a multiple-output network produces the same constant, at the cost of requiring a sample batch to estimate and optimize. We propose an encoder-mixture-decoder architecture whose decoder is multiple-output, producing multiple centers per sample, potentially tightening the bound. Assuming the data are small-variance Gaussian mixtures, this upper bound can be tracked and analyzed quantitatively."}

This design introduces inherent bottlenecks, including redundant computations of identical users/items and increased latency due to strictly sequential operations, which jointly constrain the model's capacity and system efficiency. To address these limitations, we propose the Asynchronous Inference Framework (AIF), a cost-effective computational architecture that decouples interaction-independent components, those operating within a single user or item, from real-time prediction. AIF reorganizes the model inference process by performing user-side computations in parallel with the retrieval stage and conducting item-side computations in a nearline manner. This means that interaction-independent components are calculated just once and completed before the real-time prediction phase of the pre-ranking stage. As a result, AIF enhances computational efficiency and reduces latency, freeing up resources to significantly improve the feature set and model architecture of interaction-independent components. Moreover, we delve into model design within the AIF framework, employing approximated methods for interaction-dependent components in online real-time predictions. By co-designing both the framework and the model, our solution achieves notable performance gains without significantly increasing computational and latency costs. This has enabled the successful deployment of AIF in the Taobao display advertising system."}

To address these limitations, we propose Affine Prototype Timestamp (APT), a lightweight and flexible plug-in module that injects global distribution features into the normalization-forecasting pipeline. By leveraging timestamp conditioned prototype learning, APT dynamically generates affine parameters that modulate both input and output series, enabling the backbone to learn from self-supervised, distribution-aware clustered instances. APT is compatible with arbitrary forecasting backbones and normalization strategies while introducing minimal computational overhead. Extensive experiments across six benchmark datasets and multiple backbone-normalization combinations demonstrate that APT significantly improves forecasting performance under distribution shift."}

Accurate anomaly detection and early risk forecasting in financial time series are therefore crucial for preventing systemic instability and supporting informed investment decisions. Traditional deep learning models, such as LSTM and GRU, often fail to capture long-term dependencies and complex periodic patterns in highly nonstationary financial data. To address this limitation, this study proposes a FEDformer-Based Hybrid Framework for Anomaly Detection and Risk Forecasting in Financial Time Series, which integrates the Frequency Enhanced Decomposed Transformer (FEDformer) with a residual-based anomaly detector and a risk forecasting head. The FEDformer module models temporal dynamics in both time and frequency domains, decomposing signals into trend and seasonal components for improved interpretability. The residual-based detector identifies abnormal fluctuations by analyzing prediction errors, while the risk head predicts potential financial distress using learned latent embeddings. Experiments conducted on the S&P 500, NASDAQ Composite, and Brent Crude Oil datasets (2000-2024) demonstrate the superiority of the proposed model over benchmark methods, achieving a 15.7 percent reduction in RMSE and an 11.5 percent improvement in F1-score for anomaly detection. These results confirm the effectiveness of the model in capturing financial volatility, enabling reliable early-warning systems for market crash prediction and risk management."}

Magnetic field measurements of solar active regions are converted into structured multivariate time series, enabling predictive modeling across segmented observation windows. However, the inherently imbalanced nature of solar flare occurrences, where intense flares are rare compared to minor flare events, presents a significant barrier to effective learning. To address this challenge, we propose a novel Global Cross-Time Attention Fusion (GCTAF) architecture, a transformer-based model to enhance long-range temporal modeling. Unlike traditional self-attention mechanisms that rely solely on local interactions within time series, GCTAF injects a set of learnable cross-attentive global tokens that summarize salient temporal patterns across the entire sequence. These tokens are refined through cross-attention with the input sequence and fused back into the temporal representation, enabling the model to identify globally significant, non-contiguous time points that are critical for flare prediction. This mechanism functions as a dynamic attention-driven temporal summarizer that augments the model's capacity to capture discriminative flare-related dynamics. We evaluate our approach on the benchmark solar flare dataset and show that GCTAF effectively detects intense flares and improves predictive performance, demonstrating that refining transformer-based architectures presents a high-potential alternative for solar flare prediction tasks."}

In this work, we propose a novel adversarial attack that explicitly leverages the geometric properties of hyperbolic space. Specifically, we compute the gradient of the loss function in the tangent space of hyperbolic space, decompose it into a radial (depth) component and an angular (semantic) component, and apply perturbation derived solely from the angular direction. Our method generates adversarial examples by focusing perturbations in semantically sensitive directions encoded in angular movement within the hyperbolic geometry. Empirical results on image classification, cross-modal retrieval tasks and network architectures demonstrate that our attack achieves higher fooling rates than conventional adversarial attacks, while producing high-impact perturbations with deeper insights into vulnerabilities of hyperbolic embeddings. This work highlights the importance of geometry-aware adversarial strategies in curved representation spaces and provides a principled framework for attacking hierarchical embeddings."}

We propose a new concept called fractal nodes, inspired by the fractal structure observed in real-world networks. Our approach is based on the intuition that graph partitioning naturally induces fractal structure, where subgraphs often reflect the connectivity patterns of the full graph. Fractal nodes are designed to coexist with the original nodes and adaptively aggregate subgraph-level feature representations, thereby enforcing feature similarity within each subgraph. We show that fractal nodes alleviate the over-squashing problem by providing direct shortcut connections that enable long-range propagation of subgraph-level representations. Experiment results show that our method improves the expressive power of MPNNs and achieves comparable or better performance to graph Transformers while maintaining the computational efficiency of MPNN by improving the long-range dependencies of MPNN."}

However, this method also faces limitations, particularly when dealing with Knowledge Graphs (KGs), which can hide huge information due to their semantic nature. This study introduces Bi-View, a novel hybrid approach that increases the informative content of node features in KGs to generate enhanced Graph Embeddings (GEs) that are used to improve GML models without relying on additional synthetic data. The proposed work combines two complementary GE techniques: Node2Vec, which captures structural patterns through unsupervised random walks, and GraphSAGE, which aggregates neighbourhood information in a supervised way. Node2Vec embeddings are first computed to represent the graph topology, and node features are then enriched with centrality-based metrics, which are used as input for the GraphSAGE model. Moreover, a fusion layer combines the original Node2Vec embeddings with the GraphSAGE-influenced representations, resulting in a dual-perspective embedding space. Such a fusion captures both topological and semantic properties of the graph, enabling the model to exploit informative features that may exist in the dataset but that are not explicitly represented. Our approach improves downstream task performance, especially in scenarios with poor initial features, giving the basis for more accurate and precise KG-enanched GML models."}

This setting is inspired by recommender systems scenarios where the unlabeled data corresponds to `implicit feedback' (consisting in interactions such as purchase, click, etc. ) and the labeled data corresponds to the `explicit feedback', consisting of interactions where the user has given an explicit rating to the item.

However, in typical scenarios where the fine-tuning data is limited, e.g., compared to pre-training, SFT can lead LMs to overfit, causing them to rely on spurious patterns within the target task or to compromise other broadly useful capabilities as a side effect of narrow specialization. In this paper, we propose Learning-from-the-Undesirable (LfU), a simple yet effective regularization scheme for SFT to mitigate overfitting issues when fine-tuning LMs with limited data. Specifically, we aim to regularize the fine-tuning process to favor solutions that are resilient to \"undesirable\" model updates, e.g., gradient ascent steps that steer the model toward undesirable behaviors. To this end, we propose a novel form of consistency regularization that directly aligns internal representations of the model with those after an undesirable update. By leveraging representation-level data augmentation through undesirable updates, LfU effectively promotes generalization under limited data. Our experiments on diverse LM downstream tasks show that LfU serves as an effective prior that enhances adaptability while preserving pretrained knowledge. For example, our LM from LfU achieves a 16.8% average improvement on math tasks compared to vanilla SFT on the same dataset, where the latter even leads to degraded performance on those tasks. Furthermore, LfU exhibits improved robustness to prompt variations, e.g., yielding a 92.1% lower standard deviation in output performances compared to SFT, highlighting its versatile effects."}

We address this gap by conducting a geometric analysis of the network's energy landscape. We introduce a novel metric, ``Pinnacle Sharpness,'' to quantify the local stability of attractors. By systematically varying the kernel width and storage load, we uncover a rich phase diagram of attractor shapes. Our central finding is the emergence of a ``ridge of optimization,'' where the network maximizes attractor stability under challenging high-load and global-kernel conditions. Through a theoretical decomposition of the landscape gradient into a direct ``driving'' force and an indirect ``feedback'' force, we reveal the origin of this phenomenon. The optimization ridge corresponds to a regime of strong anti-correlation between the two forces, where the direct force, amplified by the high storage load, dominates the opposing collective feedback force. This demonstrates a sophisticated self-organization mechanism: the network adaptively harnesses inter-pattern interactions as a cooperative feedback control system to sculpt a robust energy landscape. Our findings provide a new physical picture for the stability of high-capacity associative memories and offer principles for their design."}

We propose MACKO-SpMV, a GPU-optimized format and kernel co-designed to reduce storage overhead while preserving compatibility with the GPU's execution model. This enables efficient SpMV for unstructured sparsity without specialized hardware units (e.g., tensor cores) or format-specific precomputation. Empirical results show that at sparsity 50%, MACKO is the first approach with significant 1.5x memory reduction and 1.2-1.5x speedup over dense representation. Speedups over other SpMV baselines: 2.8-13.0x over cuSPARSE, 1.9-2.6x over Sputnik, and 2.2-2.5x over DASP. Applied to Llama2-7B pruned with Wanda to sparsity 50%, it delivers 1.5x memory reduction and 1.5x faster inference at fp16 precision.

This trend highlights a key limitation in the current landscape: the difficulty of selecting the most suitable model for a given graph task or dataset. To address this, we propose Self-Adaptive Graph Mixture of Models (SAGMM), a modular and practical framework that learns to automatically select and combine the most appropriate GNN models from a diverse pool of architectures. Unlike prior mixture-of-experts approaches that rely on variations of a single base model, SAGMM leverages architectural diversity and a topology-aware attention gating mechanism to adaptively assign experts to each node based on the structure of the input graph. To improve efficiency, SAGMM includes a pruning mechanism that reduces the number of active experts during training and inference without compromising performance. We also explore a training-efficient variant in which expert models are pretrained and frozen, and only the gating and task-specific layers are trained. We evaluate SAGMM on 16 benchmark datasets covering node classification, graph classification, regression, and link prediction tasks, and demonstrate that it consistently outperforms or matches leading GNN baselines and prior mixture-based methods, offering a robust and adaptive solution for real-world graph learning."}

While direct magnetic resonance imaging-guided biopsy demonstrates promising performance in detecting cancer lesions, its practical application is limited by prolonged procedure times and high costs. To overcome these issues, an indirect MRI-guided biopsy that allows the procedure to be performed outside of the MRI room has been proposed, but it still faces challenges in creating an accurate real-time deformable breast model. In our study, we tackled this issue by developing a graph neural network (GNN)-based model capable of accurately predicting deformed breast cancer sites in real time during biopsy procedures. An individual-specific finite element (FE) model was developed by incorporating magnetic resonance (MR) image-derived structural information of the breast and tumor to simulate deformation behaviors. A GNN model was then employed, designed to process surface displacement and distance-based graph data, enabling accurate prediction of overall tissue displacement, including the deformation of the tumor region. The model was validated using phantom and real patient datasets, achieving an accuracy within 0.2 millimeters (mm) for cancer node displacement (RMSE) and a dice similarity coefficient (DSC) of 0.977 for spatial overlap with actual cancerous regions. Additionally, the model enabled real-time inference and achieved a speed-up of over 4,000 times in computational cost compared to conventional FE simulations. The proposed deformation-aware GNN model offers a promising solution for real-time tumor displacement prediction in breast biopsy, with high accuracy and real-time capability. Its integration with clinical procedures could significantly enhance the precision and efficiency of breast cancer diagnosis."}

Second, most approaches lack generalizability across network topologies, requiring retraining when applied to new graphs. We introduce STACCA (Shared Transformer Actor-Critic with Counterfactual Advantage), a unified transformer-based MARL framework that addresses both challenges. STACCA employs a centralized Graph Transformer Critic to model long-range dependencies and provide system-level feedback, while its shared Graph Transformer Actor learns a generalizable policy capable of adapting across diverse network structures.

We introduce GFOES, a novel framework comprising a Generative Feedback Network (GFN) and a two-phase fine-tuning procedure. GFN synthesises Optimal Erasure Samples (OES), which induce high loss on target classes, enabling the model to forget class-specific knowledge without access to the original forget data, while preserving performance on retained classes. The two-phase fine-tuning procedure enables aggressive forgetting in the first phase, followed by utility restoration in the second. Experiments on three image classification datasets demonstrate that GFOES achieves effective forgetting at both logit and representation levels, while maintaining strong performance using only 5% of the original data. Our framework offers a practical and scalable solution for privacy-preserving machine learning under data-constrained conditions."}

However, a major bottleneck in this task is the unpaired nature of single-cell data, as the same cell cannot be observed both before and after perturbation due to the destructive nature of sequencing. Although some neural generative transport models attempt to tackle unpaired single-cell perturbation data, they either lack explicit conditioning or depend on prior spaces for indirect distribution alignment, limiting precise perturbation modeling. In this work, we approximate Schrödinger Bridge (SB), which defines stochastic dynamic mappings recovering the entropy-regularized optimal transport (OT), to directly align the distributions of control and perturbed single-cell populations across different perturbation conditions. Unlike prior SB approximations that rely on bidirectional modeling to infer optimal source-target sample coupling, we leverage Minibatch-OT based pairing to avoid such bidirectional inference and the associated ill-posedness of defining the reverse process. This pairing directly guides bridge learning, yielding a scalable approximation to the SB. We approximate two SB models, one modeling discrete gene activation states and the other continuous expression distributions. Joint training enables accurate perturbation modeling and captures single-cell heterogeneity.

Moreover, different tasks exhibit varying conflict levels, yet existing methods use a one-size-fits-all fixed sparsity strategy to keep training stability and performance, which proves inadequate. These limitations hinder the model's generalization and learning efficiency.\n  To address these issues, we propose SoCo-DT, a Soft Conflict-resolution method based by parameter importance. By leveraging Fisher information, mask values are dynamically adjusted to retain important parameters while suppressing conflicting ones. In addition, we introduce a dynamic sparsity adjustment strategy based on the Interquartile Range (IQR), which constructs task-specific thresholding schemes using the distribution of conflict and harmony scores during training. To enable adaptive sparsity evolution throughout training, we further incorporate an asymmetric cosine annealing schedule to continuously update the threshold. Experimental results on the Meta-World benchmark show that SoCo-DT outperforms the state-of-the-art method by 7.6% on MT50 and by 10.5% on the suboptimal dataset, demonstrating its effectiveness in mitigating gradient conflicts and improving overall multi-task performance."}

Despite this, conventional quantization suffers from its structural limitation that hinders flexibility during the fine-tuning and deployment stages. Practical on-device tasks demand different quantization precisions (i.e. different bit-widths), e.g., understanding tasks tend to exhibit higher tolerance to reduced precision compared to generation tasks. Conventional quantization, typically relying on scaling factors that are incompatible across bit-widths, fails to support the on-device switching of precisions when confronted with complex real-world scenarios. To overcome the dilemma, we propose OTARo, a novel method that enables on-device LLMs to flexibly switch quantization precisions while maintaining performance robustness through once fine-tuning. OTARo introduces Shared Exponent Floating Point (SEFP), a distinct quantization mechanism, to produce different bit-widths through simple mantissa truncations of a single model. Moreover, to achieve bit-width robustness in downstream applications, OTARo performs a learning process toward losses induced by different bit-widths. The method involves two critical strategies: (1) Exploitation-Exploration Bit-Width Path Search (BPS), which iteratively updates the search path via a designed scoring mechanism; (2) Low-Precision Asynchronous Accumulation (LAA), which performs asynchronous gradient accumulations and delayed updates under low bit-widths. Experiments on popular LLMs, e.g., LLaMA3.2-1B, LLaMA3-8B, demonstrate that OTARo achieves consistently strong and robust performance for all precisions."}

This paper proposes a Physics-informed Neural Operator (PINO) to predict z and y-direction distortion for the future 15 s. Our method, Physics-informed Deep Operator Network-Recurrent Neural Network (PIDeepONet-RNN) employs trunk and branch network to process temperature history and encode distortion fields, respectively, enabling decoupling of thermo-mechanical responses. By incorporating the heat conduction equation as a soft constraint, the model ensures physical consistency and suppresses unphysical artifacts, thereby establishing a more physically consistent mapping between the thermal history and distortion. This is important because such a basis function, grounded in physical laws, provides a robust and interpretable foundation for predictions. The proposed models are trained and tested using datasets generated from experimentally validated Finite Element Method (FEM). Evaluation shows that the model achieves high accuracy, low error accumulation, time efficiency. The max absolute errors in the z and y-directions are as low as 0.9733 mm and 0.2049 mm, respectively.

To address these challenges, we propose DiffFP, a fictitious play (FP) framework that estimates the best response to unseen opponents while learning a robust and multimodal behavioral policy. Specifically, we approximate the best response using a diffusion policy that leverages generative modeling to learn adaptive and diverse strategies. Through empirical evaluation, we demonstrate that the proposed FP framework converges towards $ε$-Nash equilibria in continuous- space zero-sum games.

However, current training frameworks adopt a pre-defined static parallel strategy for these sequences, causing neither communication-parallelization cancellation on short sequences nor out-of-memory on long sequences. To mitigate these issues, we propose ParaDySe, a novel adaptive Parallel strategy switching framework for Dynamic Sequences. ParaDySe enables on-the-fly optimal strategy adoption according to the immediate input sequence. It first implements the modular function libraries for parallel strategies with unified tensor layout specifications, and then builds sequence-aware memory and time cost models with hybrid methods. Guided by cost models, ParaDySe selects optimal layer-wise strategies for dynamic sequences via an efficient heuristic algorithm. By integrating these techniques together, ParaDySe achieves seamless hot-switching of optimal strategies through its well-designed function libraries. We compare ParaDySe with baselines on representative LLMs under datasets with sequence lengths up to 624K. Experimental results indicate that ParaDySe addresses OOM and CPC bottlenecks in LLM training by systematically integrating long-sequence optimizations with existing frameworks."}

However, these long CoTs result in increased token usage, leading to higher inference latency and memory consumption. As a result, balancing accuracy and reasoning efficiency has become essential for deploying reasoning LLMs in practical applications. Existing long-to-short (Long2Short) methods aim to reduce inference length but often sacrifice accuracy, revealing a need for an approach that maintains performance while lowering token costs. To address this efficiency-accuracy tradeoff, we propose TokenSqueeze, a novel Long2Short method that condenses reasoning paths while preserving performance and relying exclusively on self-generated data. First, to prevent performance degradation caused by excessive compression of reasoning depth, we propose to select self-generated samples whose reasoning depth is adaptively matched to the complexity of the problem. To further optimize the linguistic expression without altering the underlying reasoning paths, we introduce a distribution-aligned linguistic refinement method that enhances the clarity and conciseness of the reasoning path while preserving its logical integrity. Comprehensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of TokenSqueeze in reducing token usage while maintaining accuracy. Notably, DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B fine-tuned using our proposed method achieved a 50\\% average token reduction while preserving accuracy on the MATH500 benchmark. TokenSqueeze exclusively utilizes the model's self-generated data, enabling efficient and high-fidelity reasoning without relying on manually curated short-answer datasets across diverse applications.

These algorithms are widely used in political science, communication, computational social science, and computer science to estimate ideological preferences from parliamentary speeches, party manifestos, and social media. Over the past two decades, their development has closely followed broader NLP trends -- beginning with word-frequency models and most recently turning to large language models (LLMs). While this trajectory has greatly expanded the methodological toolkit, it has also produced a fragmented field that lacks systematic comparison and clear guidance for applied use. To address this gap, we identified 25 CT-IPE algorithms through a systematic literature review and conducted a manual content analysis of their modeling assumptions and development contexts. To compare them meaningfully, we introduce a conceptual framework that distinguishes how algorithms generate, capture, and aggregate textual variance. On this basis, we identify four methodological families -- word-frequency, topic modeling, word embedding, and LLM-based approaches -- and critically assess their assumptions, interpretability, scalability, and limitations. Our review offers three contributions. First, it provides a structured synthesis of two decades of algorithm development, clarifying how diverse methods relate to one another. Second, it translates these insights into practical guidance for applied researchers, highlighting trade-offs in transparency, technical requirements, and validation strategies that shape algorithm choice.

Such tasks can involve sequential interaction, requiring coherent updating of beliefs in light of new evidence, and making appropriate decisions based on those beliefs. Predicting how LLMs will perform in such dynamic environments is important, but can be tricky to determine from measurements in static settings. In this work, we examine two critical components of LLM performance: the ability of LLMs to coherently update their beliefs, and the extent to which the actions they take are consistent with those beliefs. First, we find that LLMs are largely inconsistent in how they update their beliefs; models can exhibit up to a 30% average difference between the directly elicited posterior, and the correct update of their prior. Second, we find that LLMs also often take actions which are inconsistent with the beliefs they hold. On a betting market, for example, LLMs often do not even bet in the same direction as their internally held beliefs over the underlying outcomes. We also find they have moderate self-inconsistency in how they respond to challenges by users to given answers. Finally, we show that the above properties hold even for strong models that obtain high accuracy or that are well-calibrated on the tasks at hand. Our results highlight the difficulties of predicting LLM behavior in complex real-world settings."}

However, deep RL algorithms train a deep neural network, that lacks transparency, which poses challenges when the controller has to meet regulations, or foster trust. To alleviate this, one could transfer the learned behaviour into a model that is human-readable by design using knowledge distilla- tion. Often this is done with a single model which mimics the original model on average but could struggle in more dynamic situations. A key challenge is that this simpler model should have the right balance be- tween flexibility and complexity or right balance between balance bias and accuracy. We propose a new model-agnostic method to divide the state space into regions where a simplified, human-understandable model can operate in. In this paper, we use Voronoi partitioning to find regions where linear models can achieve similar performance to the original con- troller.

Unlike vision and language tasks, where models can exploit inductive biases in the data, tabular data lacks inherent positional structure, hindering the effectiveness of self-attention mechanisms. While recent transformer-based models like TabTransformer, SAINT, and FT-Transformer (which we refer to as 3T) have shown promise on tabular data, they typically operate without leveraging structural cues such as positional encodings (PEs), as no prior structural information is usually available. In this work, we find both theoretically and empirically that structural cues, specifically PEs can be a useful tool to improve generalization performance for tabular transformers. We find that PEs impart the ability to reduce the effective rank (a form of intrinsic dimensionality) of the features, effectively simplifying the task by reducing the dimensionality of the problem, yielding improved generalization. To that end, we propose Tab-PET (PEs for Tabular Transformers), a graph-based framework for estimating and inculcating PEs into embeddings. Inspired by approaches that derive PEs from graph topology, we explore two paradigms for graph estimation: association-based and causality-based. We empirically demonstrate that graph-derived PEs significantly improve performance across 50 classification and regression datasets for 3T. Notably, association-based graphs consistently yield more stable and pronounced gains compared to causality-driven ones. Our work highlights an unexpected role of PEs in tabular transformers, revealing how they can be harnessed to improve generalization."}

Although significant progress has been made through lattices and codes, the irregularities of high-dimensional geometry and exponentially growing combinatorial complexity beyond 8 dimensions, which exceeds the complexity of Go game, limit the scalability of existing methods. Here we model this problem as a two-player matrix completion game and train the game-theoretic reinforcement learning system, PackingStar, to efficiently explore high-dimensional spaces.

In this paper, patterns are categorized into two types to handle various missing data conditions: primary patterns, which originate from internal relationships between data points, and auxiliary patterns, influenced by external factors like timestamps and node attributes. Accordingly, we propose the Primary-Auxiliary Spatio-Temporal network (PAST). It comprises a graph-integrated module (GIM) and a cross-gated module (CGM). GIM captures primary patterns via dynamic graphs with interval-aware dropout and multi-order convolutions, and CGM extracts auxiliary patterns through bidirectional gating on embedded external features.

This paper presents a theoretical analysis of how a common workaround, training for multiple epochs on the same dataset, reshapes the data scaling laws in linear regression. Concretely, we ask: to match the performance of training on a dataset of size $N$ for $K$ epochs, how much larger must a dataset be if the model is trained for only one pass? We quantify this using the \\textit{effective reuse rate} of the data, $E(K, N)$, which we define as the multiplicative factor by which the dataset must grow under one-pass training to achieve the same test loss as $K$-epoch training. Our analysis precisely characterizes the scaling behavior of $E(K, N)$ for SGD in linear regression under either strong convexity or Zipf-distributed data: (1) When $K$ is small, we prove that $E(K, N) \\approx K$, indicating that every new epoch yields a linear gain; (2) As $K$ increases, $E(K, N)$ plateaus at a problem-dependent value that grows with $N$ ($Θ(\\log N)$ for the strongly-convex case), implying that larger datasets can be repeated more times before the marginal benefit vanishes. These theoretical findings point out a neglected factor in a recent empirical study (Muennighoff et al. (2023)), which claimed that training LLMs for up to $4$ epochs results in negligible loss differences compared to using fresh data at each step, \\textit{i.e.}, $E(K, N) \\approx K$ for $K \\le 4$ in our notation. Supported by further empirical validation with LLMs, our results reveal that the maximum $K$ value for which $E(K, N) \\approx K$ in fact depends on the data size and distribution, and underscore the need to explicitly model both factors in future studies of scaling laws with data reuse."}

Existing clustering techniques either rely on fixed distance metrics or deep models designed for static data, limiting their ability to handle dynamic, unstructured industrial sequences. Addressing this gap, this paper proposes a novel framework for unsupervised discovery of operational modes in univariate time-series data using image-based convolutional clustering with composite internal evaluation. The proposed framework improves upon existing approaches in three ways: (1) raw time-series sequences are transformed into grayscale matrix representations via overlapping sliding windows, allowing effective feature extraction using a deep convolutional autoencoder; (2) the framework integrates both soft and hard clustering outputs and refines the selection through a two-stage strategy; and (3) clustering performance is objectively evaluated by a newly developed composite score, S_eva, which combines normalized Silhouette, Calinski-Harabasz, and Davies-Bouldin indices. Applied to over 3900 furnace melting operations from a Nordic foundry, the method identifies seven explainable operational patterns, revealing significant differences in energy consumption, thermal dynamics, and production duration. Compared to classical and deep clustering baselines, the proposed approach achieves superior overall performance, greater robustness, and domain-aligned explainability. The framework addresses key challenges in unsupervised time-series analysis, such as sequence irregularity, overlapping modes, and metric inconsistency, and provides a generalizable solution for data-driven diagnostics and energy optimization in industrial systems."}

Lung disease often causes increased right ventricular load, leading to RHF. Therefore, it is very important to screen out patients with cor pulmonale who develop RHF from people with underlying lung diseases. In this work, we propose a self-supervised representation learning method to early detecting RHF from patients with cor pulmonale, which uses spirogram time series to predict patients with RHF at an early stage. The proposed model is divided into two stages. The first stage is the self-supervised representation learning-based spirogram embedding (SLSE) network training process, where the encoder of the Variational autoencoder (VAE-encoder) learns a robust low-dimensional representation of the spirogram time series from the data-augmented unlabeled data. Second, this low-dimensional representation is fused with demographic information and fed into a CatBoost classifier for the downstream RHF prediction task. Trained and tested on a carefully selected subset of 26,617 individuals from the UK Biobank, our model achieved an AUROC of 0.7501 in detecting RHF, demonstrating strong population-level distinction ability. We further evaluated the model on high-risk clinical subgroups, achieving AUROC values of 0.8194 on a test set of 74 patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and 0.8413 on a set of 64 patients with valvular heart disease (VHD). These results highlight the model's potential utility in predicting RHF among clinically elevated-risk populations. In conclusion, this study presents a self-supervised representation learning approach combining spirogram time series and demographic data, demonstrating promising potential for early RHF detection in clinical practice."}

To address these issues, we propose multi-task regression GINN-LP (MTRGINN-LP), an interpretable neural network for multi-target symbolic regression. By integrating GINN-LP with a multi-task deep learning, the model combines a shared backbone including multiple power-term approximator blocks with task-specific output layers, capturing inter-target dependencies while preserving interpretability. We validate multi-task GINN-LP on practical multi-target applications, including energy efficiency prediction and sustainable agriculture. Experimental results demonstrate competitive predictive performance alongside high interpretability, effectively extending symbolic regression to broader real-world multi-output tasks."}

Under the training framework, the optimization algorithm aims to stably converge high-dimensional optimization to local and even global minima.

However, compared with stochastic gradient descent (SGD) based optimization algorithms, Adam is more likely to converge to non-flat minima. To address this issue, the AdamX algorithm is proposed. Its core innovation lies in the proposition of a novel type of second-order moment estimation exponential decay rate, which gradually weakens the learning step correction strength as training progresses, and degrades to SGD in the stable training period, thereby improving the stability of training in the stable period and possibly enhancing generalization ability. Experimental results show that our second-order moment estimation exponential decay rate is better than the current second-order moment estimation exponential decay rate, and AdamX can stably outperform Adam and its variants in terms of performance.

This challenge is compounded by spatial heterogeneity, causing models to learn spurious patterns that fit only local data. Unlike conventional domain generalization, environmental modeling must preserve invariant physical relationships and temporal coherence during augmentation. In this paper, we introduce Generalizable Representation Enhancement via Auxiliary Transformations (GREAT), a framework that effectively augments available datasets to improve predictions in completely unseen regions. GREAT guides the augmentation process to ensure that the original governing processes can be recovered from the augmented data, and the inclusion of the augmented data leads to improved model generalization. Specifically, GREAT learns transformation functions at multiple layers of neural networks to augment both raw environmental features and temporal influence. They are refined through a novel bi-level training process that constrains augmented data to preserve key patterns of the original source data. We demonstrate GREAT's effectiveness on stream temperature prediction across six ecologically diverse watersheds in the eastern U.S., each containing multiple stream segments. Experimental results show that GREAT significantly outperforms existing methods in zero-shot scenarios. This work provides a practical solution for environmental applications where comprehensive monitoring is infeasible."}

Similar to classical machine learning, QML models also face challenges arising from the scarcity of labeled data, particularly as their scale and complexity increase. Here, we introduce self-supervised pretraining of quantum representations that reduces reliance on labeled data by learning invariances from unlabeled examples. We implement this paradigm on a programmable trapped-ion quantum computer, encoding images as quantum states. In situ contrastive pretraining on hardware yields a representation that, when fine-tuned, classifies image families with higher mean test accuracy and lower run-to-run variability than models trained from random initialization. Performance improvement is especially significant in regimes with limited labeled training data. We show that the learned invariances generalize beyond the pretraining image samples. Unlike prior work, our pipeline derives similarity from measured quantum overlaps and executes all training and classification stages on hardware. These results establish a label-efficient route to quantum representation learning, with direct relevance to quantum-native datasets and a clear path to larger classical inputs."}

While neural networks are highly versatile and capable of learning complex patterns, they often lack interpretability due to their ``black box'' nature. On the other hand, probabilistic ``white box'' models, though interpretable, often suffer from a significant performance gap when compared to neural networks. To address this, we propose a novel quantum physics-based ``white box'' method that offers both accurate uncertainty quantification and enhanced interpretability. By mapping the kernel mean embedding (KME) of a time series data vector to a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS), we construct a tensor network-inspired 1D spin chain Hamiltonian, with the KME as one of its eigen-functions or eigen-modes. We then solve the associated Schr{ö}dinger equation and apply perturbation theory to quantify uncertainty, thereby improving the interpretability of tasks performed with the quantum tensor network-based model. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this methodology, compared to state-of-the-art ``white box\" models, in change point detection and time series clustering, providing insights into the uncertainties associated with decision-making throughout the process."}

This formulation substantially reduces annotation cost, simplifies training, and allows flexible patch sizing aligned with the desired level of decision granularity. In this work, we focus on a special case, patch-wise binary classification, applied to the detection of a single class of interest (tumor) on high-resolution multimodal nonlinear microscopy images. We show that, although this simplified formulation enables efficient model development, it can introduce spurious correlations between patch composition and labels: tumor patches tend to contain larger tissue regions, whereas non-tumor patches often consist mostly of background with small tissue areas. We further quantify the bias in model predictions caused by this spurious correlation, and propose to use a debiasing strategy to mitigate its effect. Specifically, we apply GERNE, a debiasing method that can be adapted to maximize worst-group accuracy (WGA). Our results show an improvement in WGA by approximately 7% compared to ERM for two different thresholds used to binarize the spurious feature. This enhancement boosts model performance on critical minority cases, such as tumor patches with small tissues and non-tumor patches with large tissues, and underscores the importance of spurious correlation-aware learning in patch-wise classification problems."}

To this end, this paper introduces a novel fair graph learning framework that mitigates bias in graph learning under limited demographic information. Specifically, we propose a mechanism guided by partial demographic data to generate proxies for demographic information and design a strategy that enforces consistent node embeddings across demographic groups. In addition, we develop an adaptive confidence strategy that dynamically adjusts each node's contribution to fairness and utility based on prediction confidence. We further provide theoretical analysis demonstrating that our framework, FairGLite, achieves provable upper bounds on group fairness metrics, offering formal guarantees for bias mitigation. Through extensive experiments on multiple datasets and fair graph learning frameworks, we demonstrate the framework's effectiveness in both mitigating bias and maintaining model utility."}

Moreover, the latent structure of graph data is often governed by multiple underlying factors, which remains less explored. To address these challenges, we propose a novel test-time graph OOD detection method, termed BaCa, that calibrates OOD scores using dual dynamically updated dictionaries without requiring fine-tuning the pre-trained model. Specifically, BaCa estimates graphons and applies a mix-up strategy solely with test samples to generate diverse boundary-aware discriminative topologies, eliminating the need for exposing auxiliary datasets as outliers. We construct dual dynamic dictionaries via priority queues and attention mechanisms to adaptively capture latent ID and OOD representations, which are then utilized for boundary-aware OOD score calibration. To the best of our knowledge, extensive experiments on real-world datasets show that BaCa significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in OOD detection."}

BoTorch, a widely used BO library, currently optimizes the summed acquisition function over multiple points, leading to the speedup of MSO owing to PyTorch batching. Nevertheless, this paper empirically demonstrates the suboptimality of this approach in terms of off-diagonal approximation errors in the inverse Hessian of a QN method, slowing down its convergence.

Supported by theory and experiments, our study spans a variety of practical deployment settings, including centralized training, ensemble learning, and distributed training. We uncover a striking dichotomy: for transfer-based attacks, decreasing the learning rate significantly enhances robustness by up to $64\\%$. In contrast, for query-based attacks, increasing the learning rate consistently leads to improved robustness by up to $28\\%$ across various settings and data distributions. Leveraging these findings, we explore -- for the first time -- the optimization hyperparameter design space to jointly enhance robustness against both transfer-based and query-based attacks. Our results reveal that distributed models benefit the most from hyperparameter tuning, achieving a remarkable tradeoff by simultaneously mitigating both attack types more effectively than other training setups."}

A notable example is checkpointing and restarting, which is essential for long-running simulations to recover from failures, resume after interruptions, or examine intermediate results. In this work, we introduce a novel framework for scientific data compression and super-resolution, grounded in recent advances in learning exponential families. Our method preserves and quantifies uncertainty in physical quantities of interest and supports flexible trade-offs between compression ratio and reconstruction fidelity."}

We formulate this joint estimation as a constrained optimization problem, where the constraints dictate the resulting similarity between the parameters of the different models, allowing the estimated parameters to differ across tasks while still combining information from multiple data sources. This framework enables knowledge transfer from tasks with abundant data to those with scarce data, leading to more accurate and reliable parameter estimates, providing a solution for scenarios where parameter inference from limited data is critical. We provide theoretical guarantees in a controlled framework with Gaussian data, and show the efficiency of our cross-learning method in applications with real data including image classification and propagation of infectious diseases."}

Existing methods often utilize extensive sets of unlabeled amino acid sequences. However, these approaches neither explicitly capture nor harness the accessible protein 3D structural data, which is recognized as a decisive factor in dictating protein functions. To address this, we utilize protein residue graphs and introduce various forms of sequential or structural connections to capture enhanced spatial information. We adeptly combine Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and Language Models (LMs), specifically utilizing a pre-trained transformer-based protein language model to encode amino acid sequences and employing message-passing mechanisms like GCN and R-GCN to capture geometric characteristics of protein structures. Employing convolution within a specific node's nearby region, including relations, we stack multiple convolutional layers to efficiently learn combined insights from the protein's spatial graph, revealing intricate interconnections and dependencies in its structural arrangement.

Incomplete knowledge of nonlinear interactions and stochastic effects often renders bottom-up modeling approaches ineffective, motivating the development of methods that can discover governing equations directly from data. In such contexts, parametric models often struggle without strong prior knowledge, especially when estimating intrinsic noise. Nonetheless, incorporating stochastic effects is often essential for understanding the dynamic behavior of complex systems such as gene regulatory networks and signaling pathways. To address these challenges, we introduce Trine (Three-phase Regression for INtrinsic noisE), a nonparametric, kernel-based framework that infers state-dependent intrinsic noise from time-series data. Trine features a three-stage algorithm that com- bines analytically solvable subproblems with a structured kernel architecture that captures both abrupt noise-driven fluctuations and smooth, state-dependent changes in variance. We validate Trine on biological and ecological systems, demonstrating its ability to uncover hidden dynamics without relying on predefined parametric assumptions. Across several benchmark problems, Trine achieves performance comparable to that of an oracle. Biologically, this oracle can be viewed as an idealized observer capable of directly tracking the random fluctuations in molecular concentrations or reaction events within a cell. The Trine framework thus opens new avenues for understanding how intrinsic noise affects the behavior of complex systems."}

While artificial intelligence (AI) models have shown promise in predicting such events, their adoption in real-world decision-making remains limited due to their black-box nature, which limits trust, explainability, and operational readiness. This paper investigates the role of explainable AI (XAI) in bridging the gap between predictive accuracy and actionable insight for extreme event forecasting. Using wildfire prediction as a case study, we evaluate various AI models and employ SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) to uncover key features, decision pathways, and potential biases in model behavior. Our analysis demonstrates how XAI not only clarifies model reasoning but also supports critical decision-making by domain experts and response teams. In addition, we provide supporting visualizations that enhance the interpretability of XAI outputs by contextualizing feature importance and temporal patterns in seasonality and geospatial characteristics. This approach enhances the usability of AI explanations for practitioners and policymakers. Our findings highlight the need for AI systems that are not only accurate but also interpretable, accessible, and trustworthy, essential for effective use in disaster preparedness, risk mitigation, and climate resilience planning."}
