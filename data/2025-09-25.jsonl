However, the deployment of deep\nneural networks (DNNs) in edge devices is hindered by the lack of\nenergy-efficient scalable computing hardware. Here, we introduce a fanout\nspatial time-of-flight optical neural network (FAST-ONN) that calculates\nbillions of convolutions per second with ultralow latency and power\nconsumption. This is enabled by the combination of high-speed dense arrays of\nvertical-cavity surface-emitting lasers (VCSELs) for input modulation with\nspatial light modulators of high pixel counts for in-memory weighting. In a\nthree-dimensional optical system, parallel differential readout allows signed\nweight values accurate inference in a single shot. The performance is\nbenchmarked with feature extraction in You-Only-Look-Once (YOLO) for\nconvolution at 100 million frames per second (MFPS), and in-system backward\npropagation training with photonic reprogrammability.

Many public estimates are inconsistent and overstate\nenergy use, because they extrapolate from limited benchmarks and fail to\nreflect efficiency gains achievable at scale. In this perspective, we introduce\na bottom-up methodology to estimate the per-query energy of large-scale LLM\nsystems based on token throughput. For models running on an H100 node under\nrealistic workloads, GPU utilization and PUE constraints, we estimate a median\nenergy per query of 0.34 Wh (IQR: 0.18-0.67) for frontier-scale models (>200\nbillion parameters). These results are consistent with measurements using\nproduction-scale configurations and show that non-production estimates and\nassumptions can overstate energy use by 4-20x. Extending to test-time scaling\nscenarios with 15x more tokens per typical query, the median energy rises 13x\nto 4.32 Wh, indicating that targeting efficiency in this regime will deliver\nthe largest fleet-wide savings. We quantify achievable efficiency gains at the\nmodel, serving platform, and hardware levels, finding individual median\nreductions of 1.5-3.5x in energy per query, while combined advances can\nplausibly deliver 8-20x reductions. To illustrate the system-level impact, we\nestimate the baseline daily energy use of a deployment serving 1 billion\nqueries to be 0.8 GWh/day. If 10% are long queries, demand could grow to 1.8\nGWh/day. With targeted efficiency interventions, it falls to 0.9 GWh/day,\nsimilar to the energy footprint of web search at that scale.

Over the years, a number of\nresearchers from both academia and industry have proposed numerous FL\nframeworks. However, to the best of our knowledge, none of them have employed\nfairness for FL-based client selection in a dynamic and heterogeneous IoV\nenvironment. Accordingly, in this paper, we envisage a FairEquityFL framework\nto ensure an equitable opportunity for all the clients to participate in the FL\ntraining process. In particular, we have introduced a sampling equalizer module\nwithin the selector component for ensuring fairness in terms of fair\ncollaboration opportunity for all the clients in the client selection process.\nThe selector is additionally responsible for both monitoring and controlling\nthe clients' participation in each FL training round. Moreover, an outlier\ndetection mechanism is enforced for identifying malicious clients based on the\nmodel performance in terms of considerable fluctuation in either accuracy or\nloss minimization. The selector flags suspicious clients and temporarily\nsuspend such clients from participating in the FL training process. We further\nevaluate the performance of FairEquityFL on a publicly available dataset,\nFEMNIST. Our simulation results depict that FairEquityFL outperforms baseline\nmodels to a considerable extent."}

Many public estimates are inconsistent and overstate\nenergy use, because they extrapolate from limited benchmarks and fail to\nreflect efficiency gains achievable at scale. In this perspective, we introduce\na bottom-up methodology to estimate the per-query energy of large-scale LLM\nsystems based on token throughput.

Extending to test-time scaling\nscenarios with 15x more tokens per typical query, the median energy rises 13x\nto 4.32 Wh, indicating that targeting efficiency in this regime will deliver\nthe largest fleet-wide savings. We quantify achievable efficiency gains at the\nmodel, serving platform, and hardware levels, finding individual median\nreductions of 1.5-3.5x in energy per query, while combined advances can\nplausibly deliver 8-20x reductions.

Production systems typically rely on tabular\ngradient-boosted decision trees (e.g., XGBoost) that score sessions\nindependently, overlooking the relational and temporal structure of online\nactivity that characterizes coordinated attacks and \"fraud rings.\" We introduce\nATLAS (Account Takeover Learning Across Spatio-Temporal Directed Graph), a\nframework that reformulates ATO detection as spatio-temporal node\nclassification on a time-respecting directed session graph. ATLAS links\nentities via shared identifiers (account, device, IP) and regulates\nconnectivity with time-window and recency constraints, enabling causal,\ntime-respecting message passing and latency-aware label propagation that uses\nonly labels available at scoring time, non-anticipative and leakage-free. We\noperationalize ATLAS with inductive GraphSAGE variants trained via neighbor\nsampling, at scale on a sessions graph with more than 100M nodes and around 1B\nedges. On a high-risk digital product at Capital One, ATLAS delivers 6.38\npercent AUC improvement and more than 50 percent reduction in customer\nfriction, improving fraud capture while reducing user friction."}

While deep learning models excel\nat capturing complex dynamics, currently, their deployment is limited due to\nphysical inconsistency and robustness, hence constraining their reliability in\nregulated environments. We introduce process-informed forecasting (PIF) models\nfor temperature in pharmaceutical lyophilization. We investigate a wide range\nof models, from classical ones such as Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average\nModel (ARIMA) and Exponential Smoothing Model (ETS), to modern deep learning\narchitectures, including Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs). We compare three\ndifferent loss function formulations that integrate a process-informed\ntrajectory prior: a fixed-weight loss, a dynamic uncertainty-based loss, and a\nResidual-Based Attention (RBA) mechanism. We evaluate all models not only for\naccuracy and physical consistency but also for robustness to sensor noise.\nFurthermore, we test the practical generalizability of the best model in a\ntransfer learning scenario on a new process. Our results show that PIF models\noutperform their data-driven counterparts in terms of accuracy, physical\nplausibility and noise resilience. This work provides a roadmap for developing\nreliable and generalizable forecasting solutions for critical applications in\nthe pharmaceutical manufacturing landscape."}
