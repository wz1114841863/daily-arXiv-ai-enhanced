*Jingli Liu,Huannan Zheng,Bohao Zou,Kezhou Yang*

Main category: cs.ET

TL;DR: IPNet是一种基于磁隧道结的神经形态架构，通过神经元内在可塑性实现类人工作记忆，在动态视觉任务中表现出色且能耗极低。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统人工网络通过循环或并行架构实现工作记忆，但存在能耗高和噪声敏感的问题。需要一种更接近生物工作记忆机制的低功耗解决方案。

Method: 利用磁隧道结的焦耳热动力学特性，物理模拟生物记忆的易失性，构建基于内在可塑性的硬件-软件协同设计神经形态架构IPNet。

Result: 在11类DVS手势数据集上达到99.65%准确率，在22类时间反转基准测试中保持99.48%，优于RNN、LSTM和2+1D CNN。能耗比LSTM降低2874倍，比3D-CNN降低90920倍。

Conclusion: 通过神经元内在可塑性实现类人工作记忆，赋予神经网络优越的动态视觉处理能力和极低的代谢成本，验证了生物合理的近传感器处理范式。

Abstract: Working memory enables the brain to integrate transient information for rapid decision-making. Artificial networks typically replicate this via recurrent or parallel architectures, yet incur high energy costs and noise sensitivity. Here we report IPNet, a hardware-software co-designed neuromorphic architecture realizing human-like working memory via neuronal intrinsic plasticity. Exploiting Joule-heating dynamics of Magnetic Tunnel Junctions (MTJs), IPNet physically emulates biological memory volatility. The memory behavior of the proposed architecture shows similar trends in n-back, free recall and memory interference tasks to that of reported human subjects. Implemented exclusively with MTJ neurons, the architecture with human-like working memory achieves 99.65% accuracy on 11-class DVS gesture datasets and maintains 99.48% on a novel 22-class time-reversed benchmark, outperforming RNN, LSTM, and 2+1D CNN baselines sharing identical backbones. For autonomous driving (DDD-20), IPNet reduces steering prediction error by 14.4% compared to ResNet-LSTM. Architecturally, we identify a 'Memory-at-the-Frontier' effect where performance is maximized at the sensing interface, validating a bio-plausible near-sensor processing paradigm. Crucially, all results rely on raw parameters from fabricated devices without optimization. Hardware-in-the-loop validation confirms the system's physical realizability. Separately, energy analysis reveals a reduction in memory power of 2,874x compared to LSTMs and 90,920x versus parallel 3D-CNNs. This capacitor-free design enables a compact ~1.5um2 footprint (28 nm CMOS): a >20-fold reduction over standard LIF neurons. Ultimately, we demonstrate that instantiating human-like working memory via intrinsic neuronal plasticity endows neural networks with the dual biological advantages of superior dynamic vision processing and minimal metabolic cost.

Main category: cs.ET

TL;DR: 提出SoilScanner无线系统，利用不同频率无线电信号在含不同盐类土壤中的传播特性差异来检测铅污染，实现低成本便携式铅检测


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 城市土壤铅污染严重影响食品安全和公共健康，但现有检测技术劳动密集且成本高昂，需要开发更便捷经济的检测方法

Method: 基于无线电频率技术，发现不同频率信号在含不同盐类（NaCl和Pb(NO3)2）土壤中的传播特性差异，通过机器学习模型分析现场样本

Result: SoilScanner能以72%准确率将土壤样本分为低铅（<200ppm）和高铅（>200ppm）两类，且未将>500ppm的高铅样本误分类

Conclusion: 基于无线技术构建便携、经济的铅检测和筛查设备是可行的，为城市土壤铅污染监测提供了新方法

Abstract: Widespread Pb (lead) contamination of urban soil significantly impacts food safety and public health and hinders city greening efforts. However, most existing technologies for measuring Pb are labor-intensive and costly. In this study, we propose SoilScanner, a radio frequency-based wireless system that can detect Pb in soils. This is based on our discovery that the propagation of different frequency band radio signals is affected differently by different salts such as NaCl and Pb(NO3)2 in the soil. In a controlled experiment, manually adding NaCl and Pb(NO3)2 in clean soil, we demonstrated that different salts reflected signals at different frequencies in distinct patterns. In addition, we confirmed the finding using uncontrolled field samples with a machine learning model. Our experiment results show that SoilScanner can classify soil samples into low-Pb and high-Pb categories (threshold at 200 ppm) with an accuracy of 72%, with no sample with > 500 ppm of Pb being misclassified. The results of this study show that it is feasible to build portable and affordable Pb detection and screening devices based on wireless technology.

### [3] [Workload Characterization for Branch Predictability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15827)
*FNU Vikas,Paul Gratz,Daniel Jiménez*

Main category: cs.AR

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种分支预测的工作负载特征分析方法，通过分支工作集大小和分支可预测性两个新指标来评估现代分支预测器的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 条件分支预测是模式识别问题，准确预测可以减少错误路径上的指令执行，提高性能和降低能耗。需要更好的工作负载特征分析方法来理解分支预测器的准确性。

Method: 提出基于工作负载的分支预测准确性标识符：分支工作集大小和分支可预测性。分支工作集定义为最常出现的分支上下文（分支地址、全局历史、局部历史的三元组）。分析了2,451个工作负载跟踪，将其分为7个分支工作集大小类别和9个可预测性类别。

Result: 分支工作集大小和分支可预测性与现代分支预测方案（如TAGE和感知器）的误预测率高度相关。通过分析分支行为，提供了对预测准确性来源的深入见解，并确定了现代分支预测器偏好的工作负载类别。

Conclusion: 提出的工作负载特征分析方法能够有效评估分支预测器的准确性，分支工作集大小和可预测性是与误预测率高度相关的关键指标，为现代分支预测器的性能分析提供了新的视角。

Abstract: Conditional branch prediction predicts the likely direction of a conditional branch instruction to support ILP extraction. Branch prediction is a pattern recognition problem that learns mappings between a context to the branch outcome. An accurate predictor reduces the number of instructions executed on the wrong path resulting in an improvement of performance and energy consumption. In this paper, we present a workload characterization methodology for branch prediction. We propose two new workload-driven branch prediction accuracy identifiers -- branch working set size and branch predictability. These parameters are highly correlated with misprediction rates of modern branch prediction schemes (e.g. TAGE and perceptron). We define the branch working set of a trace as a group of most frequently occurring branch contexts, i.e. the 3-part tuple of branch address, and associated global and local history. We analyze the branch working set's size and predictability on a per-trace basis to study its relationship with a modern branch predictor's accuracy. We have characterized 2,451 workload traces into seven branch working set size and nine predictability categories after analyzing their branch behavior. We present further insights into the source of prediction accuracy and favored workload categories for modern branch predictors.

Main category: cs.AR

TL;DR: 论文分析了面向下一代情境AI的可穿戴系统架构设计，以Aria2系统为例，强调端到端全系统建模的重要性，避免因单一组件优化而遇到其他系统瓶颈。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 下一代人机交互需要全天候、空间感知的可穿戴设备来捕获自我中心视觉和功能原语，构建用户个人情境，结合生成式AI实现强大的情境AI助手。但这类系统设计复杂且受严格的功耗限制。

Method: 提出了首个完整的可穿戴情境AI系统（Aria2）架构视图，通过系统建模和设计空间探索过程，展示了端到端全系统模型的重要性。

Result: 研究表明，在这种系统中，没有任何单一组件或类别完全主导系统功耗，这意味着需要在全系统背景下进行长期设计决策和功耗优化，避免因其他系统瓶颈而受限。

Conclusion: 端到端全系统视图对于可穿戴情境AI系统设计至关重要，需要避免Amdahl定律在功耗方面的限制，这些见解对最终实现全天候可穿戴情境AI系统具有重要意义。

Abstract: The next generation of human-oriented computing will require always-on, spatially-aware wearable devices to capture egocentric vision and functional primitives (e.g., Where am I? What am I looking at?, etc.). These devices will sense an egocentric view of the world around us to observe all human- relevant signals across space and time to construct and maintain a user's personal context. This personal context, combined with advanced generative AI, will unlock a powerful new generation of contextual AI personal assistants and applications. However, designing a wearable system to support contextual AI is a daunting task because of the system's complexity and stringent power constraints due to weight and battery restrictions. To understand how to guide design for such systems, this work provides the first complete system architecture view of one such wearable contextual AI system (Aria2), along with the lessons we have learned through the system modeling and design space exploration process. We show that an end-to-end full system model view of such systems is vitally important, as no single component or category overwhelmingly dominates system power. This means long-range design decisions and power optimizations need to be made in the full system context to avoid running into limits caused by other system bottlenecks (i.e., Amdahl's law as applied to power) or as bottlenecks change. Finally, we reflect on lessons and insights for the road ahead, which will be important toward eventually enabling all-day, wearable, contextual AI systems.

### [5] [LOG.io: Unified Rollback Recovery and Data Lineage Capture for Distributed Data Pipelines](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16038)
*Eric Simon,Renato B. Hoffmann,Lucas Alf,Dalvan Griebler*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: LOG.io 是一个为分布式数据流水线设计的解决方案，支持正确的回滚恢复和细粒度数据溯源捕获，特别适用于无服务器架构，性能在特定场景下优于异步屏障快照协议。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 分布式数据流水线需要可靠的容错机制和数据溯源能力，现有解决方案如Flink的异步屏障快照协议在处理异构操作符和动态扩展时存在限制，需要更灵活高效的恢复和溯源方案。

Method: 采用基于日志的回滚恢复协议，支持通用编程模型，可处理非确定性操作符、外部系统交互和自定义代码。实现非阻塞恢复，允许失败操作符独立恢复而不影响其他操作符，支持数据并行化和动态扩展。

Result: 在SAP Data Intelligence系统中评估，当流水线存在延迟操作符且事件吞吐量适中时，LOG.io在正常处理中表现与ABS相当，在恢复时优于ABS。数据并行化可显著减少LOG.io开销，而数据溯源捕获的开销在所有实验中低于1.5%。

Conclusion: LOG.io为分布式数据流水线提供了有效的回滚恢复和细粒度数据溯源解决方案，在特定场景下性能优于现有方法，且溯源开销可忽略不计，适合无服务器架构的弹性需求。

Abstract: This paper introduces LOG.io, a comprehensive solution designed for correct rollback recovery and fine-grain data lineage capture in distributed data pipelines. It is tailored for serverless scalable architectures and uses a log-based rollback recovery protocol. LOG.io supports a general programming model, accommodating non-deterministic operators, interactions with external systems, and arbitrary custom code. It is non-blocking, allowing failed operators to recover independently without interrupting other active operators, thereby leveraging data parallelization, and it facilitates dynamic scaling of operators during pipeline execution. Performance evaluations, conducted within the SAP Data Intelligence system, compare LOG.io with the Asynchronous Barrier Snapshotting (ABS) protocol, originally implemented in Flink. Our experiments show that when there are straggler operators in a data pipeline and the throughput of events is moderate (e.g., 1 event every 100 ms), LOG.io performs as well as ABS during normal processing and outperforms ABS during recovery. Otherwise, ABS performs better than LOG.io for both normal processing and recovery. However, we show that in these cases, data parallelization can largely reduce the overhead of LOG.io while ABS does not improve. Finally, we show that the overhead of data lineage capture, at the granularity of the event and between any two operators in a pipeline, is marginal, with less than 1.5% in all our experiments.

TL;DR: MMA通过多路径内存访问技术解决PCIe带宽瓶颈，提升GPU与主机内存间数据传输效率，显著加速LLM推理和模型切换


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PCIe带宽已成为大语言模型性能的关键瓶颈，特别是在前缀缓存获取和模型切换场景中。虽然理论上可以在GPU和主机内存之间进行多路径数据传输，但PCIe和NVLink等异构协议限制了实际带宽，导致服务器内部带宽未充分利用。

Method: 提出多路径内存访问(MMA)方案，首次实现GPU与主机内存间的高效多路径数据传输。通过动态库注入实现无缝部署，使LLM应用无需代码修改即可受益。

Result: 在测试平台上，MMA显著提升GPU与内存间数据传输带宽，峰值带宽达245 GB/s，相比原生单路径带宽提升4.62倍。端到端评估显示，MMA将LLM服务的首令牌时间(TTFT)降低1.14-2.38倍，并将vLLM睡眠模式下的模型切换延迟降低1.12-2.48倍。

Conclusion: MMA有效解决了PCIe带宽瓶颈问题，通过多路径数据传输显著提升LLM推理性能和模型切换效率，且无需修改应用代码即可部署。

Abstract: The limited bandwidth of PCIe has emerged as the critical bottleneck for large language model (LLM) performance, such as prefix cache fetching and model switching. Although intra-server multipath data transfer between GPU and host memory is theoretically possible, heterogeneous protocols such as PCIe and NVLink currently limit the bandwidth between host memory and GPUs to that of a single PICe link. This limitation resuals in underutilized intra-server bandwidth. To address this issue, we propose Multipath Memory Access (MMA), a scheme that, to the best of our knowledge, is the first to enalbe efficient multipath data transfer between GPU and host memory. MMA supports seamless deployment via dynamic library injection, enabling LLM applications to benefit from MMA without requiring any code modification. In our testbed, MMA significantly improves the data transfer bandwidth between the GPU and memory, achieving a peak bandwidth of 245 GB/s-representing a 4.62x speedup compared to the natice single-path bandwidth. End-to-end evaluations demonstrate that MMA reduces the time-to-first-token (TTFT) for LLM serving by 1.14x to 2.38x and decreases model-switching latency in vLLM's sleep mode by 1.12x to 2.48x.

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种面向目标语义孪生（GOST）框架，作为传统数字孪生在空间-天空-地面-海洋一体化网络中的轻量级替代方案，优先考虑"效用"而非"保真度"。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统数字孪生在SAGSIN中面临计算开销大、模型同步延迟和跨系统语义鸿沟等根本性限制，无法满足实时态势感知和智能运维维护的需求。

Method: 提出GOST框架，基于知识驱动语义、数据驱动语义和目标导向原则三层架构，构建轻量级、任务特定的表示，而非追求物理镜像。

Result: 在远程卫星-无人机网络协同跟踪任务案例研究中，GOST在感知数据时效性和协同跟踪性能方面显著优于传统数字孪生。

Conclusion: GOST作为一种变革性的孪生范式，能够指导SAGSIN的发展，通过语义技术和目标导向原则解决传统数字孪生的局限性。

Abstract: A space-air-ground-sea integrated network (SAGSIN) has emerged as a cornerstone of 6G systems, establishing a unified global architecture by integrating multi-domain network resources. Motivated by the demand for real-time situational awareness and intelligent operational maintenance, digital twin (DT) technology was initially regarded as a promising solution, owing to its capability to create virtual replicas and emulate physical system behaviors. However, in the context of SAGSIN, the high-fidelity, full-scale modeling paradigm inherent to conventional DTs encounters fundamental limitations, including prohibitive computational overhead, delayed model synchronization, and cross-system semantic gaps. To address these limitations, this survey paper proposes a novel twinning framework: goal-oriented semantic twin (GOST). Unlike DTs that pursue physical mirroring, GOST prioritizes ``utility'' over ``fidelity,'' leveraging semantic technologies and goal-oriented principles to construct lightweight, task-specific representations. This paper systematically articulates the GOST framework through three layers: knowledge-based semantics, data-driven semantics, and goal-oriented principles. Furthermore, we provide a comprehensive tutorial on constructing GOST by detailing its core enabling technologies and introduce a multidimensional evaluation framework for GOST. We present a case study targeting collaborative tracking tasks in remote satellite-UAV networks, demonstrating that GOST significantly outperforms conventional DTs in timeliness of perceptual data and collaborative tracking. Finally, we outline research directions, establishing GOST as a transformative twinning paradigm to guide the development of SAGSIN.

TL;DR: 该论文提出将冷启动视为开发者可见的设计问题，通过分析开源系统问题报告构建分类法，并开发了SCABENCH基准测试和INITSCOPE分析框架，显著提升了冷启动问题诊断的准确性和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 无服务器计算简化了部署和扩展，但冷启动延迟仍然是主要的性能瓶颈。现有研究将缓解措施视为黑盒优化，而本文认为冷启动应该是开发者可见的设计问题，需要更系统的方法来诊断和解决。

Method: 1) 分析81个开源无服务器系统的问题报告，构建初始化反模式、修复策略和诊断挑战的分类法；2) 开发SCABENCH可复现基准测试；3) 设计INITSCOPE轻量级分析框架，将加载的代码与执行的代码关联起来。

Result: 在SCABENCH上，INITSCOPE相比现有工具将定位准确率提高了40%，诊断工作量减少了64%。开发者研究显示任务准确率更高，诊断速度更快。研究工件已公开可用。

Conclusion: 该研究为无服务器设计中的冷启动缓解提供了基于证据、性能感知的实践方法，通过系统化的分类法和工具支持，显著改善了冷启动问题的诊断和解决效率。

Abstract: Serverless computing simplifies deployment and scaling, yet cold-start latency remains a major performance bottleneck. Unlike prior work that treats mitigation as a black-box optimization, we study cold starts as a developer-visible design problem. From 81 adjudicated issue reports across open-source serverless systems, we derive taxonomies of initialization anti-patterns, remediation strategies, and diagnostic challenges spanning design, packaging, and runtime layers. Building on these insights, we introduce SCABENCH, a reproducible benchmark, and INITSCOPE, a lightweight analysis framework linking what code is loaded with what is executed. On SCABENCH, INITSCOPE improved localization accuracy by up to 40% and reduced diagnostic effort by 64% compared with prior tools, while a developer study showed higher task accuracy and faster diagnosis. Together, these results advance evidence-driven, performance-aware practices for cold-start mitigation in serverless design. Availability: The research artifact is publicly accessible for future studies and improvements.

TL;DR: 提出在线调度框架，通过条件负载均衡、动态分区和作业迁移解决MIG GPU的资源争用和碎片化问题，使makespan提升达35%


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代GPU工作负载需要高效资源共享，但NVIDIA的MIG技术虽然提供硬件级GPU分区，仍面临PCIe带宽等共享组件的资源争用问题，以及由于MIG配置有限导致的GPU碎片化问题（包括空间不连续性和刚性配置文件放置约束）

Method: 提出在线调度框架，整合条件负载均衡、动态分区和作业迁移技术，动态调整作业放置以减少争用，并重组GPU分配以应对内部和外部碎片化

Result: 实验结果显示该方法显著提升系统效率，当所有技术都应用时，makespan（总完成时间）改善高达35%

Conclusion: 提出的在线调度框架能有效解决MIG GPU的资源争用和碎片化问题，显著提升GPU资源共享效率

Abstract: Modern GPU workloads increasingly demand efficient resource sharing, as many jobs do not require the full capacity of a GPU. Among sharing techniques, NVIDIA's Multi-Instance GPU (MIG) offers strong resource isolation by enabling hardware-level GPU partitioning. However, leveraging MIG effectively introduces new challenges. First, resource contention persists due to shared components such as PCIe bandwidth. Second, GPU fragmentation becomes a critical issue, which is different from prior fine-grained GPU sharing work due to MIG's limited number of valid MIG configurations. Fragmentation arises not only from spatial discontinuity but also from rigid profile placement constraints, especially after job arrivals and terminations. To address these issues, we propose an online scheduling framework that integrates conditional load balancing, dynamic partitioning, and job migration. Our approach dynamically adapts job placement to minimize contention and reorganizes GPU allocations to combat both internal and external fragmentation. Experimental results show that our method significantly improves system efficiency. When all techniques are applied, the makespan improves by up to 35%.

TL;DR: 提出Staggered Batch Scheduling (SBS)机制，通过缓冲请求形成最优执行批次，解决DP+EP架构中的内部同步问题，显著降低TTFT并提升吞吐量


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型服务向复杂分布式架构（特别是P/D分离的大规模DP+EP范式）演进，带来了独特的调度挑战。与传统部署中调度器可将实例视为黑盒不同，DP+EP架构具有高昂的内部同步成本。立即请求调度会导致严重的引擎内排队和并行化气泡，降低首词生成时间(TTFT)。

Method: 提出Staggered Batch Scheduling (SBS)机制，通过故意缓冲请求形成最优执行批次，实现时间解耦以消除内部排队气泡。同时利用缓冲创建的调度窗口，引入负载感知全局分配策略，平衡DP单元在Prefill和Decode阶段的计算负载。

Result: 在部署Deepseek-V3的生产H800集群上，相比最先进的立即调度基线，系统将TTFT降低了30%-40%，吞吐量提升了15%-20%。

Conclusion: SBS机制通过缓冲请求形成最优批次，有效解决了DP+EP架构中的内部同步问题，显著提升了LLM服务的响应时间和吞吐性能。

Abstract: The evolution of Large Language Model (LLM) serving towards complex, distributed architectures--specifically the P/D-separated, large-scale DP+EP paradigm--introduces distinct scheduling challenges. Unlike traditional deployments where schedulers can treat instances as black boxes, DP+EP architectures exhibit high internal synchronization costs. We identify that immediate request dispatching in such systems leads to severe in-engine queuing and parallelization bubbles, degrading Time-to-First-Token (TTFT). To address this, we propose Staggered Batch Scheduling (SBS), a mechanism that deliberately buffers requests to form optimal execution batches. This temporal decoupling eliminates internal queuing bubbles without compromising throughput. Furthermore, leveraging the scheduling window created by buffering, we introduce a Load-Aware Global Allocation strategy that balances computational load across DP units for both Prefill and Decode phases. Deployed on a production H800 cluster serving Deepseek-V3, our system reduces TTFT by 30%-40% and improves throughput by 15%-20% compared to state-of-the-art immediate scheduling baselines.

Result: 实验结果显示，与现有分解内存架构上的最先进事务系统相比，Lotus将事务吞吐量提升最高达2.1倍，延迟降低最高达49.4%。

Conclusion: Lotus通过锁分解和创新的锁管理机制，有效解决了分解内存架构中RDMA网卡的瓶颈问题，实现了高性能、可扩展的分布式事务处理。

Abstract: Disaggregated memory (DM) separates compute and memory resources, allowing flexible scaling to achieve high resource utilization. To ensure atomic and consistent data access on DM, distributed transaction systems have been adapted, where compute nodes (CNs) rely on one-sided RDMA operations to access remote data in memory nodes (MNs). However, we observe that in existing transaction systems, the RDMA network interface cards at MNs become a primary performance bottleneck. This bottleneck arises from the high volume of one-sided atomic operations used for locks, which hinders the system's ability to scale efficiently.
  To address this issue, this paper presents Lotus, a scalable distributed transaction system with lock disaggregation on DM. The key innovation of Lotus is to disaggregate locks from data and execute all locks on CNs, thus eliminating the bottleneck at MN RNICs. To achieve efficient lock management on CNs, Lotus employs an application-aware lock management mechanism that leverages the locality of the OLTP workloads to shard locks while maintaining load balance. To ensure consistent transaction processing with lock disaggregation, Lotus introduces a lock-first transaction protocol, which separates the locking phase as the first step in each read-write transaction execution. This protocol allows the system to determine the success of lock acquisitions early and proactively abort conflicting transactions, improving overall efficiency. To tolerate lock loss during CN failures, Lotus employs a lock-rebuild-free recovery mechanism that treats locks as ephemeral and avoids their reconstruction, ensuring lightweight recovery for CN failures. Experimental results demonstrate that Lotus improves transaction throughput by up to 2.1$\times$ and reduces latency by up to 49.4% compared to state-of-the-art transaction systems on DM.

TL;DR: FlexKV 是一个内存解耦的键值存储系统，通过索引代理技术将索引动态卸载到计算节点，解决了现有系统对单边原子操作的过度依赖和计算侧缓存效率低下的问题，实现了高达2.94倍的吞吐量提升和85.2%的延迟降低。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 内存解耦架构将CPU和内存解耦为独立资源池以提高利用率，但现有的内存解耦键值存储系统存在两个关键问题：1) 索引处理过度依赖单边原子操作；2) 计算侧缓存效率受限。这些问题导致系统性能不佳。

Method: FlexKV 提出索引代理技术，将索引动态卸载到计算节点，利用其强大的CPU加速索引处理。具体解决三个挑战：1) 基于等级感知的热度检测算法平衡计算节点间的索引负载；2) 两级计算节点内存优化方案高效利用内存；3) RPC聚合的缓存管理机制降低缓存一致性开销。

Result: 实验结果表明，与最先进的内存解耦键值存储系统相比，FlexKV 将吞吐量提升高达2.94倍，延迟降低高达85.2%。

Conclusion: FlexKV 通过索引代理技术有效解决了内存解耦键值存储系统的性能瓶颈，显著提升了系统性能，为内存解耦架构下的高效数据管理提供了新思路。

Abstract: Disaggregated memory (DM) is a promising data center architecture that decouples CPU and memory into independent resource pools to improve resource utilization. Building on DM, memory-disaggregated key-value (KV) stores are adopted to efficiently manage remote data. Unfortunately, existing approaches suffer from poor performance due to two critical issues: 1) the overdependence on one-sided atomic operations in index processing, and 2) the constrained efficiency in compute-side caches. To address these issues, we propose FlexKV, a memory-disaggregated KV store with index proxying. Our key idea is to dynamically offload the index to compute nodes, leveraging their powerful CPUs to accelerate index processing and maintain high-performance compute-side caches. Three challenges have to be addressed to enable efficient index proxying on DM, i.e., the load imbalance across compute nodes, the limited memory of compute nodes, and the expensive cache coherence overhead. FlexKV proposes: 1) a rank-aware hotness detection algorithm to continuously balance index load across compute nodes, 2) a two-level CN memory optimization scheme to efficiently utilize compute node memory, and 3) an RPC-aggregated cache management mechanism to reduce cache coherence overhead. The experimental results show that FlexKV improves throughput by up to 2.94$\times$ and reduces latency by up to 85.2%, compared with the state-of-the-art memory-disaggregated KV stores.

*En-Ming Huang,Li-Shang Lin,Chun-Yi Lee*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: 提出了一种CPU-GPU协同推理框架，通过GPU专家缓存机制减少数据传输，利用CPU多线程处理缓存未命中，在消费级硬件上提升MoE模型推理性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型计算需求高，在消费级硬件上部署困难。MoE模型虽然通过选择性激活参数提高了效率，但现有最优MoE模型仍需要超出典型消费级GPU容量的内存。传统的卸载方法在CPU和GPU之间传输模型权重会引入延迟，限制了推理性能。

Method: 提出新颖的CPU-GPU协同推理框架：1）在GPU上引入专家缓存机制，减少数据传输需求，通过缓存命中实现更快推理；2）将计算卸载到CPU，高效处理缓存未命中情况，利用CPU多线程优化；3）针对单请求推理场景最大化硬件利用率。

Result: 评估表明该框架实现了性能提升，突显了CPU-GPU协作在消费级系统上最大化硬件利用率的潜力。

Conclusion: CPU-GPU协同推理框架通过专家缓存机制和计算卸载策略，有效解决了MoE模型在消费级硬件上的部署挑战，为单请求推理场景提供了高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved impressive results across various tasks, yet their high computational demands pose deployment challenges, especially on consumer-grade hardware. Mixture of Experts (MoE) models provide an efficient solution through selective activation of parameter subsets, which reduces computation requirements. Despite this efficiency, state-of-the-art MoE models still require substantial memory beyond typical consumer GPU capacities. Traditional offloading methods that transfer model weights between CPU and GPU introduce latency, limiting inference performance. This paper presents a novel CPU-GPU collaborative inference framework that incorporates an expert caching mechanism on the GPU to reduce data transfer requirements and enable faster inference through cache hits. Computations are offloaded to CPU for efficient cache miss handling, which benefits from CPU multithreading optimizations. The evaluations of our framework demonstrate performance improvements and highlight the potential of CPU-GPU collaboration to maximize hardware utilization for single-request inference scenarios on consumer-grade systems. The implementation of our framework is available at https://github.com/elsa-lab/MoE-CPU-GPU-Collaborative-Inference.

TL;DR: 提出多阶段边缘服务器升级（M-ESU）规划问题，通过混合整数线性规划和启发式算法解决边缘计算系统长期升级优化问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MEC系统需要长期升级以适应任务增长和延迟要求变化，但缺乏考虑多阶段预算约束和服务器升级/部署联合优化的规划框架

Method: 提出M-ESU问题框架，包含服务器部署/升级决策和任务卸载优化；开发MILP精确算法用于小规模网络，以及M-ESU/H启发式算法用于大规模网络

Result: 小规模网络中M-ESU/H算法解与最优解差距在1.25%内且运行速度快几个数量级；大规模网络中相比其他启发式算法任务满足率提升达21.57%

Conclusion: M-ESU框架和M-ESU/H算法能有效解决MEC系统长期规划问题，在预算和需求增长条件下显著提升任务满足率，具有实际应用价值

Abstract: In this paper, the Multi-stage Edge Server Upgrade (M-ESU) is proposed as a new network planning problem, involving the upgrading of an existing multi-access edge computing (MEC) system through multiple stages (e.g., over several years). More precisely, the problem considers two key decisions: (i) whether to deploy additional edge servers or upgrade those already installed, and (ii) how tasks should be offloaded so that the average number of tasks that meet their delay requirement is maximized. The framework specifically involves: (i) deployment of new servers combined with capacity upgrades for existing servers, and (ii) the optimal task offloading to maximize the average number of tasks with a delay requirement. It also considers the following constraints: (i) budget per stage, (ii) server deployment and upgrade cost (in $) and cost depreciation rate, (iii) computation resource of servers, (iv) number of tasks and their growth rate (in %), and (v) the increase in task sizes and stricter delay requirements over time. We present two solutions: a Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) model and an efficient heuristic algorithm (M-ESU/H). MILP yields the optimal solution for small networks, whereas M-ESU/H is used in large-scale networks. For small networks, the simulation results show that the solution computed by M-ESU/H is within 1.25% of the optimal solution while running several orders of magnitude faster. For large networks, M-ESU/H is compared against three alternative heuristic solutions that consider only server deployment, or giving priority to server deployment or upgrade. Our experiments show that M-ESU/H yields up to 21.57% improvement in task satisfaction under identical budget and demand growth conditions, confirming its scalability and practical value for long-term MEC systems.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DiscoverDCP：结合符号回归与DCP规则的框架，自动发现全局凸的模型表达式，避免后验凸性验证的复杂计算


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统固定参数凸函数（如二次函数）形式受限且不够准确，而系统辨识中发现的模型需要保证凸性以便用于安全关键的控制和优化任务。后验验证凸性计算复杂且不可行。

Method: 将符号回归与Disciplined Convex Programming（DCP）规则集集成，强制所有发现的候选模型表达式都遵守DCP组合规则，从而确保输出表达式在构造时就是全局凸的。

Result: 该方法能够发现比传统固定参数凸表达式（如二次函数）更灵活、更准确的凸替代模型，同时保持模型的凸性保证。

Conclusion: DiscoverDCP框架能够生成可解释、可验证且灵活的凸模型，适用于安全关键的控制和优化任务，通过构造保证凸性，避免了计算复杂的后验验证过程。

Abstract: We propose DiscoverDCP, a data-driven framework that integrates symbolic regression with the rule sets of Disciplined Convex Programming (DCP) to perform system identification. By enforcing that all discovered candidate model expressions adhere to DCP composition rules, we ensure that the output expressions are globally convex by construction, circumventing the computationally intractable process of post-hoc convexity verification. This approach allows for the discovery of convex surrogates that exhibit more relaxed and accurate functional forms than traditional fixed-parameter convex expressions (e.g., quadratic functions). The proposed method produces interpretable, verifiable, and flexible convex models suitable for safety-critical control and optimization tasks.

TL;DR: AIE4ML是首个针对AMD Versal AIE-ML架构的全面AI模型自动优化框架，实现接近架构峰值的性能，支持全片上执行，在粒子物理等超低延迟场景中达到GPU级吞吐量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在AMD Versal AI Engine上进行高效AI推理面临挑战：VLIW执行紧密耦合、数据路径显式管理、本地内存管理复杂。现有工作仅关注单核优化，未解决跨2D阵列的完整神经网络执行问题。

Method: 1) 单核级优化达到架构峰值性能；2) 图级和系统级提供结构化并行化方法，利用2D AIE-ML阵列和专用内存瓦片实现全片上执行；3) 开发高效线性层实现，支持偏置加法和ReLU激活融合；4) 通过新颖的图放置和搜索算法生成确定性、紧凑、拓扑优化的布局；5) 无缝集成hls4ml/PyTorch量化模型，保持位精确性。

Conclusion: AIE4ML是首个针对AMD AIE-ML架构的全面AI模型优化框架，实现了接近理论峰值的性能和高资源利用率，特别适用于粒子物理触发系统等超低延迟环境，成为实际可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Efficient AI inference on AMD's Versal AI Engine (AIE) is challenging due to tightly coupled VLIW execution, explicit datapaths, and local memory management. Prior work focused on first-generation AIE kernel optimizations, without tackling full neural network execution across the 2D array. In this work, we present AIE4ML, the first comprehensive framework for converting AI models automatically into optimized firmware targeting the AIE-ML generation devices, also with forward compatibility for the newer AIE-MLv2 architecture. At the single-kernel level, we attain performance close to the architectural peak. At the graph and system levels, we provide a structured parallelization method that can scale across the 2D AIE-ML fabric and exploit its dedicated memory tiles to stay entirely on-chip throughout the model execution. As a demonstration, we designed a generalized and highly efficient linear-layer implementation with intrinsic support for fused bias addition and ReLU activation. Also, as our framework necessitates the generation of multi-layer implementations, our approach systematically derives deterministic, compact, and topology-optimized placements tailored to the physical 2D grid of the device through a novel graph placement and search algorithm. Finally, the framework seamlessly accepts quantized models imported from high-level tools such as hls4ml or PyTorch while preserving bit-exactness. In layer scaling benchmarks, we achieve up to 98.6% efficiency relative to the single-kernel baseline, utilizing 296 of 304 AIE tiles (97.4%) of the device with entirely on-chip data movement. With evaluations across real-world model topologies, we demonstrate that AIE4ML delivers GPU-class throughput under microsecond latency constraints, making it a practical companion for ultra-low-latency environments such as trigger systems in particle physics experiments.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出混合集成框架，结合量子情感分析、决策变换器架构和战略模型选择，在标普500预测中实现60.14%方向准确性，比单个模型提升3.10%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 金融市场预测具有挑战性，大多数模型难以超过55-57%的准确性。现有方法存在架构多样性不足、情感分析能力有限、弱预测器影响集成效果等问题。

Method: 1. 架构多样性优先：结合不同学习算法（LSTM、决策变换器、XGBoost、随机森林、逻辑回归）在同一数据上训练；2. 使用4量子比特变分量子电路增强情感分析；3. 智能过滤排除准确性低于52%的弱预测器；4. 采用Top-7模型集成策略。

Result: 在2020-2023年市场数据上，实现60.14%方向准确性，比相同架构多数据集方法（52.80%）显著提升。量子情感分析为每个模型带来0.8-1.5%增益。Top-7模型集成（60.14%）优于所有35个模型集成（51.2%）。McNemar检验统计显著（p<0.05）。

Conclusion: 架构多样性比数据集多样性更重要。量子增强情感分析能有效提升预测性能。智能模型选择对集成效果至关重要。该框架具有实际交易潜力，初步回测显示夏普比率1.2优于买入持有策略的0.8。

Abstract: Financial market prediction is a challenging application of machine learning, where even small improvements in directional accuracy can yield substantial value. Most models struggle to exceed 55--57\% accuracy due to high noise, non-stationarity, and market efficiency. We introduce a hybrid ensemble framework combining quantum sentiment analysis, Decision Transformer architecture, and strategic model selection, achieving 60.14\% directional accuracy on S\&P 500 prediction, a 3.10\% improvement over individual models.
  Our framework addresses three limitations of prior approaches. First, architecture diversity dominates dataset diversity: combining different learning algorithms (LSTM, Decision Transformer, XGBoost, Random Forest, Logistic Regression) on the same data outperforms training identical architectures on multiple datasets (60.14\% vs.\ 52.80\%), confirmed by correlation analysis ($r>0.6$ among same-architecture models). Second, a 4-qubit variational quantum circuit enhances sentiment analysis, providing +0.8\% to +1.5\% gains per model. Third, smart filtering excludes weak predictors (accuracy $<52\%$), improving ensemble performance (Top-7 models: 60.14\% vs.\ all 35 models: 51.2\%).
  We evaluate on 2020--2023 market data across seven instruments, covering diverse regimes including the COVID-19 crash and inflation-driven correction. McNemar's test confirms statistical significance ($p<0.05$). Preliminary backtesting with confidence-based filtering (6+ model consensus) yields a Sharpe ratio of 1.2 versus buy-and-hold's 0.8, demonstrating practical trading potential.

TL;DR: SHARe-KAN框架通过Gain-Shape-Bias向量量化解决Vision KANs的内存瓶颈问题，配合LUTHAM编译器实现88倍内存减少，同时保持原始精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs)面临基本的内存墙问题：其学习的基础函数导致参数数量巨大，带来极高的带宽需求，阻碍了在内存受限环境中的部署。

Method: 提出SHARe-KAN框架，采用Gain-Shape-Bias向量量化来利用函数冗余性同时保持密集拓扑结构；配合LUTHAM硬件感知编译器进行静态内存规划。

Result: 实现88倍运行时内存减少（从1.13GB降至12.91MB），在PASCAL VOC上匹配未压缩基线精度；在NVIDIA Ampere架构上实现>90%的L2缓存驻留，使工作负载与DRAM带宽约束解耦。

Conclusion: SHARe-KAN成功解决了Vision KANs的内存瓶颈问题，通过创新的量化方法和硬件感知编译技术，在保持精度的同时大幅减少内存需求，使KANs在内存受限环境中变得可行。

Abstract: Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) face a fundamental memory wall: their learned basis functions create parameter counts that impose extreme bandwidth demands, hindering deployment in memory-constrained environments. We show that Vision KANs exhibit a holographic topology, where information is distributed across the interference of splines rather than localized to specific edges. Consequently, traditional pruning fails (10% sparsity degrades mAP from 85.23% to 45%, a $\sim$40-point drop). To address this, we present SHARe-KAN, a framework utilizing Gain-Shape-Bias Vector Quantization to exploit functional redundancy while preserving the dense topology. Coupled with LUTHAM, a hardware-aware compiler with static memory planning, we achieve $88\times$ runtime memory reduction (1.13 GB $\to$ 12.91 MB) and match uncompressed baseline accuracy on PASCAL VOC. Profiling on NVIDIA Ampere architecture confirms $>90\%$ L2 cache residency, demonstrating that the workload is decoupled from DRAM bandwidth constraints inherent to spline-based architectures.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究对低频和高频图信号在推荐中的作用认识不清，传统观点认为GNN推荐成功主要归因于低通滤波，但近期研究表明高频信号也很重要。需要澄清不同频率图信号在推荐中的实际作用。

Method: 1) 理论证明低频和高频图信号在推荐任务中效果等价；2) 提出频率信号缩放器（plug-and-play模块），通过调整图信号滤波函数来微调用户-物品对平滑度；3) 提出空间翻转方法，解决图嵌入方法无法完全捕捉图信号特征的问题。

Result: 实验证明：1) 仅使用低频或高频图信号就足以实现有效推荐；2) 提出的方法在四个公开数据集上验证有效；3) 频率信号缩放器可与任何GNN模型兼容；4) 空间翻转方法能恢复图嵌入的表达能力。

Conclusion: 低频和高频图信号在推荐中具有等价作用，都通过平滑用户-物品对相似性来提升性能。提出的频率信号缩放器和空间翻转方法能有效增强GNN推荐系统的表现，且证明单一频率信号已足够进行有效推荐。

Abstract: Spectral graph neural networks (GNNs) are highly effective in modeling graph signals, with their success in recommendation often attributed to low-pass filtering. However, recent studies highlight the importance of high-frequency signals. The role of low-frequency and high-frequency graph signals in recommendation remains unclear. This paper aims to bridge this gap by investigating the influence of graph signals on recommendation performance. We theoretically prove that the effects of low-frequency and high-frequency graph signals are equivalent in recommendation tasks, as both contribute by smoothing the similarities between user-item pairs. To leverage this insight, we propose a frequency signal scaler, a plug-and-play module that adjusts the graph signal filter function to fine-tune the smoothness between user-item pairs, making it compatible with any GNN model. Additionally, we identify and prove that graph embedding-based methods cannot fully capture the characteristics of graph signals. To address this limitation, a space flip method is introduced to restore the expressive power of graph embeddings. Remarkably, we demonstrate that either low-frequency or high-frequency graph signals alone are sufficient for effective recommendations. Extensive experiments on four public datasets validate the effectiveness of our proposed methods. Code is avaliable at https://github.com/mojosey/SimGCF.

TL;DR: LLaDA2.0是一个通过系统转换自回归模型构建的离散扩散大语言模型，包含16B和100B参数的两个MoE变体，采用创新的三阶段块级训练方案，实现了知识继承和高效部署。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统从头训练大型扩散模型成本高昂，需要探索更高效的构建方式。本文旨在通过转换预训练的自回归模型来构建前沿规模的离散扩散语言模型，实现知识继承和高效部署。

Method: 提出三阶段块级WSD训练方案：1）渐进增加块大小的块扩散（预热），2）大规模全序列扩散（稳定），3）回归紧凑块大小扩散（衰减）。通过SFT和DPO进行后训练对齐，构建了16B和100B参数的MoE变体。

Conclusion: LLaDA2.0建立了从前沿规模自回归模型转换到离散扩散模型的新范式，通过创新的训练方案实现了知识继承和高效部署，为大规模扩散语言模型的实际应用提供了可行方案。

Abstract: This paper presents LLaDA2.0 -- a tuple of discrete diffusion large language models (dLLM) scaling up to 100B total parameters through systematic conversion from auto-regressive (AR) models -- establishing a new paradigm for frontier-scale deployment. Instead of costly training from scratch, LLaDA2.0 upholds knowledge inheritance, progressive adaption and efficiency-aware design principle, and seamless converts a pre-trained AR model into dLLM with a novel 3-phase block-level WSD based training scheme: progressive increasing block-size in block diffusion (warm-up), large-scale full-sequence diffusion (stable) and reverting back to compact-size block diffusion (decay). Along with post-training alignment with SFT and DPO, we obtain LLaDA2.0-mini (16B) and LLaDA2.0-flash (100B), two instruction-tuned Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) variants optimized for practical deployment. By preserving the advantages of parallel decoding, these models deliver superior performance and efficiency at the frontier scale. Both models were open-sourced.

TL;DR: Janus框架统一生成与预测，通过解耦潜在空间实现异构材料微结构的实时物理引导逆向设计


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 异构材料微结构的逆向设计是一个病态且计算昂贵的问题，传统方法难以处理高维设计空间、多模态输入和高度非线性物理关系。现有生成模型虽能建模复杂前向行为，但缺乏支持快速稳定确定性逆向设计的能力。

Method: 提出Janus统一生成-预测框架，结合深度编码器-解码器架构与可分离的KHRONOS预测头。通过联合目标学习同时满足生成逆向和物理预测的等距潜在流形，实现潜在空间的解耦。

Result: 在MNIST数据集上验证了高保真重建、准确分类和多样逆向生成。在热导率标记的异构微结构设计中，前向预测R²=0.98（2%相对误差），重建误差低于5%。逆向解满足目标属性1%相对误差，潜在流形平滑遍历。

Conclusion: Janus通过统一预测和生成于单一潜在空间，实现了实时、物理引导的微结构逆向生成，计算成本远低于传统优化方法，为材料设计提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Inverse design of heterogeneous material microstructures is a fundamentally ill-posed and famously computationally expensive problem. This is exacerbated by the high-dimensional design spaces associated with finely resolved images, multimodal input property streams, and a highly nonlinear forward physics. Whilst modern generative models excel at accurately modeling such complex forward behavior, most of them are not intrinsically structured to support fast, stable \emph{deterministic} inversion with a physics-informed bias. This work introduces Janus, a unified generative-predictive framework to address this problem. Janus couples a deep encoder-decoder architecture with a predictive KHRONOS head, a separable neural architecture. Topologically speaking, Janus learns a latent manifold simultaneously isometric for generative inversion and pruned for physical prediction; the joint objective inducing \emph{disentanglement} of the latent space. Janus is first validated on the MNIST dataset, demonstrating high-fidelity reconstruction, accurate classification and diverse generative inversion of all ten target classes. It is then applied to the inverse design of heterogeneous microstructures labeled with thermal conductivity. It achieves a forward prediction accuracy $R^2=0.98$ (2\% relative error) and sub-5\% pixelwise reconstruction error. Inverse solutions satisfy target properties to within $1\%$ relative error. Inverting a sweep through properties reveal smooth traversal of the latent manifold, and UMAP visualization confirms the emergence of a low-dimensional, disentangled manifold. By unifying prediction and generation within a single latent space, Janus enables real-time, physics-informed inverse microstructure generation at a lower computational cost typically associated with classical optimization-based approaches.

TL;DR: 提出D3G方法，在推理时生成多样化人口统计数据，提升CLIP等预训练多模态模型的零样本图像分类准确率并减少人口统计偏差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图像分类模型面临三个主要问题：1）低容量模型在细粒度分类中表现不佳；2）缺乏高质量的跨模态类别表示数据；3）数据集人口统计不平衡导致预测偏向多数类别，造成有害偏差。这些问题在零样本图像分类中尤为突出。

Conclusion: D3G方法能有效提升零样本图像分类准确率并减少人口统计偏差，为缓解多模态模型中的偏差问题提供了训练免费的解决方案。

Abstract: Image classification is a task essential for machine perception to achieve human-level image understanding. Multimodal models such as CLIP have been able to perform well on this task by learning semantic similarities across vision and language; however, despite these advances, image classification is still a challenging task. Models with low capacity often suffer from underfitting and thus underperform on fine-grained image classification. Along with this, it is important to ensure high-quality data with rich cross-modal representations of each class, which is often difficult to generate. When datasets do not enforce balanced demographics, the predictions will be biased toward the more represented class, while others will be neglected. We focus on how these issues can lead to harmful bias for zero-shot image classification, and explore how to combat these issues in demographic bias. We propose Diverse Demographic Data Generation (D3G), a training-free, zero-shot method of boosting classification accuracy while reducing demographic bias in pre-trained multimodal models. With this method, we utilize CLIP as our base multimodal model and Stable Diffusion XL as our generative model. We demonstrate that providing diverse demographic data at inference time improves performance for these models, and explore the impact of individual demographics on the resulting accuracy metric.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉物种识别需要大量标注数据，但物种级标注需要领域专家，通常只能获得少量标注样本。虽然FSL专家模型在少量数据上表现良好，但LMMs在通用识别任务中表现出色，作者想探究LMMs在专业VSR任务中的表现以及是否优于FSL模型。

Abstract: Visual Species Recognition (VSR) is pivotal to biodiversity assessment and conservation, evolution research, and ecology and ecosystem management. Training a machine-learned model for VSR typically requires vast amounts of annotated images. Yet, species-level annotation demands domain expertise, making it realistic for domain experts to annotate only a few examples. These limited labeled data motivate training an ''expert'' model via few-shot learning (FSL). Meanwhile, advanced Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have demonstrated prominent performance on general recognition tasks. It is straightforward to ask whether LMMs excel in the highly specialized VSR task and whether they outshine FSL expert models. Somewhat surprisingly, we find that LMMs struggle in this task, despite using various established prompting techniques. LMMs even significantly underperform FSL expert models, which are as simple as finetuning a pretrained visual encoder on the few-shot images. However, our in-depth analysis reveals that LMMs can effectively post-hoc correct the expert models' incorrect predictions. Briefly, given a test image, when prompted with the top predictions from an FSL expert model, LMMs can recover the ground-truth label. Building on this insight, we derive a simple method called Post-hoc Correction (POC), which prompts an LMM to re-rank the expert model's top predictions using enriched prompts that include softmax confidence scores and few-shot visual examples. Across five challenging VSR benchmarks, POC outperforms prior art of FSL by +6.4% in accuracy without extra training, validation, or manual intervention. Importantly, POC generalizes to different pretrained backbones and LMMs, serving as a plug-and-play module to significantly enhance existing FSL methods.

TL;DR: ReLU MLP在NTK机制下，在原点附近展现出二次外推特性，而非线性外推


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 分析ReLU多层感知机在NTK机制下原点附近的外推行为，因为NTK特征映射不具有平移不变性，原点附近的外推与远离原点的外推是不同的特殊情况

Method: 在NTK机制下分析ReLU网络的特征映射特性，研究原点附近的外推行为

Result: 发现ReLU NTK在原点附近展现出二次外推特性，这与远离原点时的线性外推形成对比

Conclusion: ReLU网络在NTK机制下，原点附近的外推行为是二次的，这为理解神经网络外推行为提供了新的视角

Abstract: It has been demonstrated both theoretically and empirically that the ReLU MLP tends to extrapolate linearly for an out-of-distribution evaluation point. The machine learning literature provides ample analysis with respect to the mechanisms to which linearity is induced. However, the analysis of extrapolation at the origin under the NTK regime remains a more unexplored special case. In particular, the infinite-dimensional feature map induced by the neural tangent kernel is not translationally invariant. This means that the study of an out-of-distribution evaluation point very far from the origin is not equivalent to the evaluation of a point very near the origin. And since the feature map is rotation invariant, these two special cases may represent the most canonically extreme bounds of ReLU NTK extrapolation. Ultimately, it is this loose recognition of the two special cases of extrapolation that motivate the discovery of quadratic extrapolation for an evaluation close to the origin.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GLOW是一个统一的Agentic Workflows性能预测框架，结合GNN的图结构建模能力和LLM的推理能力，通过图导向LLM提取拓扑感知语义特征，并与GNN编码的结构表示融合，使用对比对齐策略优化潜在空间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Agentic Workflows的自动化生成受限于执行评估的高成本和延迟，现有性能预测方法无法同时捕捉AWs的复杂拓扑依赖和深层语义逻辑。

Method: 提出GLOW框架：1）使用图导向LLM（在图任务上指令调优）提取拓扑感知语义特征；2）融合GNN编码的结构表示；3）采用对比对齐策略优化潜在空间以区分高质量AWs。

Result: 在FLORA-Bench上的大量实验表明，GLOW在预测准确性和排序效用方面优于最先进的基线方法。

Conclusion: GLOW通过结合GNN和LLM的优势，有效解决了AW性能预测中拓扑依赖和语义逻辑的联合建模问题，为AW自动化生成提供了高效的评估替代方案。

Abstract: Agentic Workflows (AWs) have emerged as a promising paradigm for solving complex tasks. However, the scalability of automating their generation is severely constrained by the high cost and latency of execution-based evaluation. Existing AW performance prediction methods act as surrogates but fail to simultaneously capture the intricate topological dependencies and the deep semantic logic embedded in AWs. To address this limitation, we propose GLOW, a unified framework for AW performance prediction that combines the graph-structure modeling capabilities of GNNs with the reasoning power of LLMs. Specifically, we introduce a graph-oriented LLM, instruction-tuned on graph tasks, to extract topologically aware semantic features, which are fused with GNN-encoded structural representations. A contrastive alignment strategy further refines the latent space to distinguish high-quality AWs. Extensive experiments on FLORA-Bench show that GLOW outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in prediction accuracy and ranking utility.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出TAO-Net两阶段自适应OOD分类网络，用于加密流量分类，能同时处理已知和未知应用，通过混合OOD检测和LLM语义增强提示实现细粒度分类。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 加密流量分类面临新应用不断涌现的挑战，产生超出已知分布的OOD流量模式。现有方法依赖预定义类别，无法有效处理未知流量类型，或将未知流量简单归为"其他"类别，缺乏细粒度分类能力。

Method: 提出两阶段自适应OOD分类网络(TAO-Net)：第一阶段采用混合OOD检测机制，结合基于transformer的层间变换平滑度和特征分析来区分ID和OOD流量；第二阶段利用大语言模型，通过新颖的语义增强提示策略，将OOD流量分类转化为生成任务，实现无需预定义标签的灵活细粒度分类。

Result: 在三个数据集上的实验表明，TAO-Net达到96.81-97.70%的宏精度和96.77-97.68%的宏F1分数，显著优于先前方法（仅44.73-86.30%宏精度），特别是在识别新兴网络应用方面表现优异。

Conclusion: TAO-Net通过创新的两阶段设计，有效解决了加密流量分类中OOD流量处理的问题，实现了对已知和未知应用的准确细粒度分类，为动态变化的网络环境提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Encrypted traffic classification aims to identify applications or services by analyzing network traffic data. One of the critical challenges is the continuous emergence of new applications, which generates Out-of-Distribution (OOD) traffic patterns that deviate from known categories and are not well represented by predefined models. Current approaches rely on predefined categories, which limits their effectiveness in handling unknown traffic types. Although some methods mitigate this limitation by simply classifying unknown traffic into a single "Other" category, they fail to make a fine-grained classification. In this paper, we propose a Two-stage Adaptive OOD classification Network (TAO-Net) that achieves accurate classification for both In-Distribution (ID) and OOD encrypted traffic. The method incorporates an innovative two-stage design: the first stage employs a hybrid OOD detection mechanism that integrates transformer-based inter-layer transformation smoothness and feature analysis to effectively distinguish between ID and OOD traffic, while the second stage leverages large language models with a novel semantic-enhanced prompt strategy to transform OOD traffic classification into a generation task, enabling flexible fine-grained classification without relying on predefined labels. Experiments on three datasets demonstrate that TAO-Net achieves 96.81-97.70% macro-precision and 96.77-97.68% macro-F1, outperforming previous methods that only reach 44.73-86.30% macro-precision, particularly in identifying emerging network applications.

Motivation: 解决高维数据和变量共线性带来的科学数据解释挑战，超越传统相关性分析的限制，提供更强大的可解释性和简约性。

Method: 基于Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks开发两种可视化工具：PKAN矩阵表征变量对间的非线性关联，MKAN矩阵作为非线性特征排序工具量化输入变量对目标变量的相对贡献。

Result: 实验比较表明，PKAN和MKAN相比Pearson相关性和互信息方法产生更鲁棒和丰富的结果，能够捕捉关系的强度和函数形式。

Conclusion: 这些工具支持模型开发工作流的前处理和后处理，有助于发现隐藏的物理模式并促进基于领域知识的模型开发。

Abstract: Interpreting complex datasets remains a major challenge for scientists, particularly due to high dimensionality and collinearity among variables. We introduce a novel application of Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) to enhance interpretability and parsimony beyond what traditional correlation analyses offer. We present two interpretable, color-coded visualization tools: the Pairwise KAN Matrix (PKAN) and the Multivariate KAN Contribution Matrix (MKAN). PKAN characterizes nonlinear associations between pairs of variables, while MKAN serves as a nonlinear feature-ranking tool that quantifies the relative contributions of inputs in predicting a target variable. These tools support pre-processing (e.g., feature selection, redundancy analysis) and post-processing (e.g., model explanation, physical insights) in model development workflows. Through experimental comparisons, we demonstrate that PKAN and MKAN yield more robust and informative results than Pearson Correlation and Mutual Information. By capturing the strength and functional forms of relationships, these matrices facilitate the discovery of hidden physical patterns and promote domain-informed model development.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统核反应堆堆芯设计方法（确定性、元启发式、机器学习辅助）在固定的人工定义配置空间中搜索，限制了发现全新设计拓扑的能力。需要一种能够超越人为设计约束、发现根本性新设计的方法。

Method: ReactorFold框架将燃料组件设计重新表述为语言模型的序列建模问题。使用蒙特卡洛数据、参数高效微调和直接偏好优化（DPO）训练模型，学习压水堆组件的潜在结构，并通过单次前向传递生成候选布局。

Result: DPO对齐的模型展现出设计空间扩展的涌现能力：尽管仅在固定数量钆可燃吸收体（Gd）棒的配置上训练，却能自主调整Gd库存以满足严格的功率峰值约束。模型还发现了高性能的非对称配置，挑战了传统的对称装载启发式方法。

Conclusion: 语言模型能够内化因果物理关系并超越人为设计约束，访问传统搜索方法无法达到的设计区域，为核反应堆设计开辟了新途径。

Abstract: Designing nuclear reactor cores requires navigating large discrete design spaces governed by complex neutronic interactions. Traditional deterministic, metaheuristic, and machine-learning-assisted methods search within fixed, human-defined configuration spaces, limiting their ability to discover fundamentally new design topologies. Here we introduce ReactorFold, a generative framework that reformulates fuel-assembly design as a sequence modeling problem for language models. Using Monte Carlo data, parameter-efficient fine-tuning, and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), the model learns the latent structure of a pressurized-water-reactor assembly and generates candidate layouts in a single forward pass. Notably, the DPO-aligned model exhibits emergent design-space expansion: despite being trained exclusively on configurations with a fixed number of gadolinium burnable absorber (Gd) rods, it autonomously adjusts Gd inventory to satisfy strict power-peaking constraints. The model also discovers high-performing asymmetric configurations that challenge conventional symmetric loading heuristics, accessing design regimes inaccessible to conventional search methods and demonstrating that language models can internalize causal physical relationships and transcend human-imposed design constraints.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Kascade是一种无需训练的稀疏注意力方法，通过锚点层计算Top-k索引并在中间层重用，显著加速长上下文LLM推理，在H100 GPU上实现最高4.1倍解码加速和2.2倍预填充加速，同时保持接近密集注意力的精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 注意力机制是长上下文LLM推理的主要延迟来源，特别是在推理模型和RAG等日益流行的工作负载中。现有方法需要解决长上下文推理中的计算瓶颈问题。

Method: Kascade利用两个关键观察：1）softmax后的注意力本质上是稀疏的；2）高权重键的标识在相邻层间是稳定的。方法包括：在锚点层计算精确的Top-k索引，在中间重用层复用这些索引；通过动态规划算法选择锚点层以最大化跨层相似性；实现头感知的Top-k选择和重用；支持预填充和解码注意力的高效实现。

Result: 在H100 GPU上，相比FlashAttention-3基准，Kascade实现了最高4.1倍的解码注意力加速和2.2倍的预填充注意力加速。在LongBench和AIME-24等长上下文基准测试中，精度与密集注意力非常接近。

Conclusion: Kascade是一种有效的训练无关稀疏注意力方法，通过利用注意力稀疏性和跨层稳定性，显著加速长上下文LLM推理，同时保持高精度，易于在不同模型上部署。

Abstract: Attention is the dominant source of latency during long-context LLM inference, an increasingly popular workload with reasoning models and RAG. We propose Kascade, a training-free sparse attention method that leverages known observations such as 1) post-softmax attention is intrinsically sparse, and 2) the identity of high-weight keys is stable across nearby layers. Kascade computes exact Top-k indices in a small set of anchor layers, then reuses those indices in intermediate reuse layers. The anchor layers are selected algorithmically, via a dynamic-programming objective that maximizes cross-layer similarity over a development set, allowing easy deployment across models. The method incorporates efficient implementation constraints (e.g. tile-level operations), across both prefill and decode attention. The Top-k selection and reuse in Kascade is head-aware and we show in our experiments that this is critical for high accuracy. Kascade achieves up to 4.1x speedup in decode attention and 2.2x speedup in prefill attention over FlashAttention-3 baseline on H100 GPUs while closely matching dense attention accuracy on long-context benchmarks such as LongBench and AIME-24.

Motivation: 传统多视角支持向量机(MvSVM)在高维空间中使用核技巧时难以有效捕捉决策边界，容易产生误差，且难以处理多视角数据集中的视角不一致问题。现有方法需要解决大规模二次规划问题，计算效率低。

Method: 提出多视角孪生限制核机(TMvRKM)，采用正则化最小二乘方法确定最优分离超平面，避免传统二次规划。模型包含耦合项平衡多视角误差，结合早期融合（训练时利用所有视角信息）和晚期融合（适应各视角特定变化）策略。

Result: 在UCI、KEEL和AwA基准数据集上的实验和统计分析表明，TMvRKM在所有场景中都优于基线模型，展现出卓越的泛化性能。

Conclusion: TMvRKM成功整合了核机与多视角框架的优势，解决了传统核方法的关键计算和泛化挑战，为多视角学习提供了一种高效且性能优越的新方法。

Abstract: Multi-view learning (MVL) is an emerging field in machine learning that focuses on improving generalization performance by leveraging complementary information from multiple perspectives or views. Various multi-view support vector machine (MvSVM) approaches have been developed, demonstrating significant success. Moreover, these models face challenges in effectively capturing decision boundaries in high-dimensional spaces using the kernel trick. They are also prone to errors and struggle with view inconsistencies, which are common in multi-view datasets. In this work, we introduce the multiview twin restricted kernel machine (TMvRKM), a novel model that integrates the strengths of kernel machines with the multiview framework, addressing key computational and generalization challenges associated with traditional kernel-based approaches. Unlike traditional methods that rely on solving large quadratic programming problems (QPPs), the proposed TMvRKM efficiently determines an optimal separating hyperplane through a regularized least squares approach, enhancing both computational efficiency and classification performance. The primal objective of TMvRKM includes a coupling term designed to balance errors across multiple views effectively. By integrating early and late fusion strategies, TMvRKM leverages the collective information from all views during training while remaining flexible to variations specific to individual views. The proposed TMvRKM model is rigorously tested on UCI, KEEL, and AwA benchmark datasets. Both experimental results and statistical analyses consistently highlight its exceptional generalization performance, outperforming baseline models in every scenario.

Result: 模型能够将胶原VI患者图像分类为三个主要致病机制组：外显子跳跃、甘氨酸替代和假外显子插入，F1分数达到0.82，优于单机构模型（0.57-0.75）

Conclusion: 联邦学习显著提高了诊断效用和泛化能力，不仅支持更准确的诊断，还有助于解释意义不确定的变异，指导测序策略以识别新的致病变异

Abstract: The application of Machine Learning (ML) to the diagnosis of rare diseases, such as collagen VI-related dystrophies (COL6-RD), is fundamentally limited by the scarcity and fragmentation of available data. Attempts to expand sampling across hospitals, institutions, or countries with differing regulations face severe privacy, regulatory, and logistical obstacles that are often difficult to overcome. The Federated Learning (FL) provides a promising solution by enabling collaborative model training across decentralized datasets while keeping patient data local and private. Here, we report a novel global FL initiative using the Sherpa.ai FL platform, which leverages FL across distributed datasets in two international organizations for the diagnosis of COL6-RD, using collagen VI immunofluorescence microscopy images from patient-derived fibroblast cultures. Our solution resulted in an ML model capable of classifying collagen VI patient images into the three primary pathogenic mechanism groups associated with COL6-RD: exon skipping, glycine substitution, and pseudoexon insertion. This new approach achieved an F1-score of 0.82, outperforming single-organization models (0.57-0.75). These results demonstrate that FL substantially improves diagnostic utility and generalizability compared to isolated institutional models. Beyond enabling more accurate diagnosis, we anticipate that this approach will support the interpretation of variants of uncertain significance and guide the prioritization of sequencing strategies to identify novel pathogenic variants.

Abstract: Industry 4.0 is growing quickly, which has changed smart production by encouraging the use of real-time tracking, machine learning, and AI-driven systems to make operations run more smoothly. The main focus of this dissertation is on creating and testing an intelligent production system for XRIT that solves important problems like energy management, predictive maintenance, and AI-powered decision support. Machine learning models are built into the system, such as the Random Forest Classifier for proactive maintenance and the Isolation Forest for finding outliers. These models help with decision-making and reducing downtime. Streamlit makes real-time data visualisation possible, giving workers access to dashboards that they can interact with and see real-time observations.The system was tested with fake data and is made to be scalable, so it can be used in real time in XRIT's production setting. Adding an AI-powered virtual assistant made with GPT-4 lets workers get real-time, useful information that makes complicated questions easier to answer and improves operational decisions. The testing shows that the system makes working efficiency, energy management, and the ability to plan repairs much better. Moving the system to real-time data merging and looking for other ways to make it better will be the main focus of future work.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦学习在非IID数据条件下收敛缓慢，现有解决方案将所有客户端更新同等对待，忽略了语义有效性。需要将领域知识约束融入分布式优化以改善性能。

Method: 提出语义约束联邦聚合（SCFA）框架，将领域知识约束融入联邦学习优化过程。使用知识图谱编码约束（如ISA-95和MASON本体），构建包含3000个约束的知识图。理论分析证明收敛率为O(1/sqrt(T) + ρ)，其中ρ表示约束违反率。

Result: 在博世生产数据（118万样本，968个传感器特征）上验证，显示22%更快的收敛速度，41.3%的模型分歧减少。约束违反阈值ρ<0.05时保持90%最优性能，ρ>0.18时导致灾难性失败。在ε=10的差分隐私下，约束正则化将效用保持在非私有基线的3.7%内，相比标准联邦学习的12.1%退化有2.7倍改进。

Conclusion: SCFA通过将领域知识约束融入联邦学习，显著改善了非IID数据下的收敛性能、隐私-效用权衡和模型鲁棒性，为约束驱动的联邦学习提供了首个收敛理论框架。

Abstract: Federated learning enables collaborative model training across distributed data sources but suffers from slow convergence under non-IID data conditions. Existing solutions employ algorithmic modifications treating all client updates identically, ignoring semantic validity. We introduce Semantic-Constrained Federated Aggregation (SCFA), a theoretically-grounded framework incorporating domain knowledge constraints into distributed optimization. We prove SCFA achieves convergence rate O(1/sqrt(T) + rho) where rho represents constraint violation rate, establishing the first convergence theory for constraint-based federated learning. Our analysis shows constraints reduce effective data heterogeneity by 41% and improve privacy-utility tradeoffs through hypothesis space reduction by factor theta=0.37. Under (epsilon,delta)-differential privacy with epsilon=10, constraint regularization maintains utility within 3.7% of non-private baseline versus 12.1% degradation for standard federated learning, representing 2.7x improvement. We validate our framework on manufacturing predictive maintenance using Bosch production data with 1.18 million samples and 968 sensor features, constructing knowledge graphs encoding 3,000 constraints from ISA-95 and MASON ontologies. Experiments demonstrate 22% faster convergence, 41.3% model divergence reduction, and constraint violation thresholds where rho<0.05 maintains 90% optimal performance while rho>0.18 causes catastrophic failure. Our theoretical predictions match empirical observations with R^2>0.90 across convergence, privacy, and violation-performance relationships.

Abstract: Dimensionless learning is a data-driven framework for discovering dimensionless numbers and scaling laws from experimental measurements. This tutorial introduces the method, explaining how it transforms experimental data into compact physical laws that reveal compact dimensional invariance between variables. The approach combines classical dimensional analysis with modern machine learning techniques. Starting from measurements of physical quantities, the method identifies the fundamental ways to combine variables into dimensionless groups, then uses neural networks to discover which combinations best predict the experimental output. A key innovation is a regularization technique that encourages the learned coefficients to take simple, interpretable values like integers or half-integers, making the discovered laws both accurate and physically meaningful. We systematically investigate how measurement noise and discrete sampling affect the discovery process, demonstrating that the regularization approach provides robustness to experimental uncertainties. The method successfully handles cases with single or multiple dimensionless numbers, revealing how different but equivalent representations can capture the same underlying physics. Despite recent progress, key challenges remain, including managing the computational cost of identifying multiple dimensionless groups, understanding the influence of data characteristics, automating the selection of relevant input variables, and developing user-friendly tools for experimentalists. This tutorial serves as both an educational resource and a practical guide for researchers seeking to apply dimensionless learning to their experimental data.

Abstract: Thrombosis in rotary blood pumps arises from complex flow conditions that remain difficult to translate into reliable and interpretable risk predictions using existing computational models. This limitation reflects an incomplete understanding of how specific flow features contribute to thrombus initiation and growth. This study introduces an interpretable machine learning framework for spatial thrombosis assessment based directly on computational fluid dynamics-derived flow features. A logistic regression (LR) model combined with a structured feature-selection pipeline is used to derive a compact and physically interpretable feature set, including nonlinear feature combinations. The framework is trained using spatial risk patterns from a validated, macro-scale thrombosis model for two representative scenarios. The model reproduces the labeled risk distributions and identifies distinct sets of flow features associated with increased thrombosis risk. When applied to a centrifugal pump, despite training on a single axial pump operating point, the model predicts plausible thrombosis-prone regions. These results show that interpretable machine learning can link local flow features to thrombosis risk while remaining computationally efficient and mechanistically transparent. The low computational cost enables rapid thrombogenicity screening without repeated or costly simulations. The proposed framework complements physics-based thrombosis modeling and provides a methodological basis for integrating interpretable machine learning into CFD-driven thrombosis analysis and device design workflows.

Motivation: 术中低血压（IOH）具有显著的手术风险，但由于患者特异性差异，准确预测仍然具有挑战性。虽然测试时适应（TTA）为个性化预测提供了有前景的方法，但低血压事件的稀少性常常导致测试时训练不可靠。

Abstract: Intraoperative hypotension (IOH) poses significant surgical risks, but accurate prediction remains challenging due to patient-specific variability. While test-time adaptation (TTA) offers a promising approach for personalized prediction, the rarity of IOH events often leads to unreliable test-time training. To address this, we propose CSA-TTA, a novel Cross-Sample Augmented Test-Time Adaptation framework that enhances training by incorporating hypotension events from other individuals. Specifically, we first construct a cross-sample bank by segmenting historical data into hypotensive and non-hypotensive samples. Then, we introduce a coarse-to-fine retrieval strategy for building test-time training data: we initially apply K-Shape clustering to identify representative cluster centers and subsequently retrieve the top-K semantically similar samples based on the current patient signal. Additionally, we integrate both self-supervised masked reconstruction and retrospective sequence forecasting signals during training to enhance model adaptability to rapid and subtle intraoperative dynamics. We evaluate the proposed CSA-TTA on both the VitalDB dataset and a real-world in-hospital dataset by integrating it with state-of-the-art time series forecasting models, including TimesFM and UniTS. CSA-TTA consistently enhances performance across settings-for instance, on VitalDB, it improves Recall and F1 scores by +1.33% and +1.13%, respectively, under fine-tuning, and by +7.46% and +5.07% in zero-shot scenarios-demonstrating strong robustness and generalization.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: AdaGradSelect是一种针对小型语言模型的自适应参数高效微调方法，通过基于梯度选择要更新的Transformer块，在保持性能接近全微调的同时显著减少计算和内存开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统全微调LLMs成本高且内存需求大，而现有PEFT方法（如LoRA）将训练限制在有限子空间中，有时会降低性能。对于小型语言模型，效率提升更为重要，需要更有效的微调方法。

Method: AdaGradSelect基于梯度自适应选择要更新的Transformer块。它结合了基于Dirichlet的采样（考虑历史更新频率）和epsilon-greedy探索策略，早期探索不同块，后期聚焦最重要块。

Result: AdaGradSelect训练速度提升约12%，GPU内存使用减少35%，性能接近全微调。在GSM8K数据集上，平均比LoRA（rank 256）提升约3%，在MATH数据集上达到相似准确率。

Conclusion: AdaGradSelect为小型语言模型提供了比传统微调方法更有效和资源高效的替代方案，在保持性能的同时显著降低计算和内存成本。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) can perform many NLP tasks well, but fully fine-tuning them is expensive and requires a lot of memory. Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods such as LoRA reduce this cost by adding small low-rank updates to frozen model weights. However, these methods restrict the training to a limited subspace, which can sometimes reduce performance.
  For Small Language Models (SLMs), where efficiency gains matter even more, we introduce AdaGradSelect, an adaptive method that selects which transformer blocks to update based on gradients.
  Early observations showed that updating only the transformer blocks with the highest gradient norms can achieve performance close to full fine-tuning. Building on this insight, AdaGradSelect adaptively chooses which blocks to train. It uses a combination of Dirichlet-based sampling, which depends on how frequently blocks were updated in the past, and an epsilon-greedy exploration strategy. This lets the method explore different blocks in early training and gradually focus on the most important ones in later epochs.
  Experiments show that AdaGradSelect trains about 12 percent faster and uses 35 percent less GPU memory while delivering performance very close to full fine-tuning. On the GSM8K dataset, it outperforms LoRA (rank 256) by about 3 percent on average across models such as Qwen2.5-0.5B, LLaMA3.2-1B, and Phi4-mini-3.8B. It also achieves similar accuracy on the MATH dataset. Overall, AdaGradSelect provides a more effective and resource-efficient alternative to traditional fine-tuning methods.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种针对使用DPO训练的大语言模型的高效数据估值方法，利用DPO的数学结构简化了Shapley值的计算，解决了传统数据估值方法计算成本过高的问题。

Conclusion: DPO训练的大语言模型具有特殊的数学结构，能够实现高效的数据估值计算，解决了传统Shapley值计算的计算瓶颈问题，为数据所有者的决策制定和资源协作提供了实用工具。

Abstract: Data is a critical asset for training large language models (LLMs), alongside compute resources and skilled workers. While some training data is publicly available, substantial investment is required to generate proprietary datasets, such as human preference annotations or to curate new ones from existing sources. As larger datasets generally yield better model performance, two natural questions arise. First, how can data owners make informed decisions about curation strategies and data sources investment? Second, how can multiple data owners collaboratively pool their resources to train superior models while fairly distributing the benefits? This problem, data valuation, which is not specific to large language models, has been addressed by the machine learning community through the lens of cooperative game theory, with the Shapley value being the prevalent solution concept. However, computing Shapley values is notoriously expensive for data valuation, typically requiring numerous model retrainings, which can become prohibitive for large machine learning models. In this work, we demonstrate that this computational challenge is dramatically simplified for LLMs trained with Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). We show how the specific mathematical structure of DPO enables scalable Shapley value computation. We believe this observation unlocks many applications at the intersection of data valuation and large language models.

Conclusion: GNN混合孪生方法能够用少量数据增强物理模型，克服空间测量稀疏的限制，实现更准确可靠的模拟

Abstract: Simulating complex unsteady physical phenomena relies on detailed mathematical models, simulated for instance by using the Finite Element Method (FEM). However, these models often exhibit discrepancies from the reality due to unmodeled effects or simplifying assumptions. We refer to this gap as the ignorance model. While purely data-driven approaches attempt to learn full system behavior, they require large amounts of high-quality data across the entire spatial and temporal domain. In real-world scenarios, such information is unavailable, making full data-driven modeling unreliable. To overcome this limitation, we model of the ignorance component using a hybrid twin approach, instead of simulating phenomena from scratch. Since physics-based models approximate the overall behavior of the phenomena, the remaining ignorance is typically lower in complexity than the full physical response, therefore, it can be learned with significantly fewer data. A key difficulty, however, is that spatial measurements are sparse, also obtaining data measuring the same phenomenon for different spatial configurations is challenging in practice. Our contribution is to overcome this limitation by using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to represent the ignorance model. GNNs learn the spatial pattern of the missing physics even when the number of measurement locations is limited. This allows us to enrich the physics-based model with data-driven corrections without requiring dense spatial, temporal and parametric data. To showcase the performance of the proposed method, we evaluate this GNN-based hybrid twin on nonlinear heat transfer problems across different meshes, geometries, and load positions. Results show that the GNN successfully captures the ignorance and generalizes corrections across spatial configurations, improving simulation accuracy and interpretability, while minimizing data requirements.

Abstract: Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) are central to modeling complex systems across physical, biological, and engineering domains, yet traditional numerical methods often struggle with high-dimensional or complex problems. Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have emerged as an efficient alternative by embedding physics-based constraints into deep learning frameworks, but they face challenges in achieving high accuracy and handling complex boundary conditions. In this work, we extend the Time-Evolving Natural Gradient (TENG) framework to address Dirichlet boundary conditions, integrating natural gradient optimization with numerical time-stepping schemes, including Euler and Heun methods, to ensure both stability and accuracy. By incorporating boundary condition penalty terms into the loss function, the proposed approach enables precise enforcement of Dirichlet constraints. Experiments on the heat equation demonstrate the superior accuracy of the Heun method due to its second-order corrections and the computational efficiency of the Euler method for simpler scenarios. This work establishes a foundation for extending the framework to Neumann and mixed boundary conditions, as well as broader classes of PDEs, advancing the applicability of neural network-based solvers for real-world problems.

Abstract: Diffusion Policy (DP) excels in embodied control but suffers from high inference latency and computational cost due to multiple iterative denoising steps. The temporal complexity of embodied tasks demands a dynamic and adaptable computation mode. Static and lossy acceleration methods, such as quantization, fail to handle such dynamic embodied tasks, while speculative decoding offers a lossless and adaptive yet underexplored alternative for DP. However, it is non-trivial to address the following challenges: how to match the base model's denoising quality at lower cost under time-varying task difficulty in embodied settings, and how to dynamically and interactively adjust computation based on task difficulty in such environments. In this paper, we propose Temporal-aware Reinforcement-based Speculative Diffusion Policy (TS-DP), the first framework that enables speculative decoding for DP with temporal adaptivity. First, to handle dynamic environments where task difficulty varies over time, we distill a Transformer-based drafter to imitate the base model and replace its costly denoising calls. Second, an RL-based scheduler further adapts to time-varying task difficulty by adjusting speculative parameters to maintain accuracy while improving efficiency. Extensive experiments across diverse embodied environments demonstrate that TS-DP achieves up to 4.17 times faster inference with over 94% accepted drafts, reaching an inference frequency of 25 Hz and enabling real-time diffusion-based control without performance degradation.

Motivation: 传统t-SNE使用的高斯核缺乏数据依赖性且计算开销大，限制了其在分类生物序列分析中的可扩展性和有效性。虽然已有研究提出隔离核作为替代，但仍可能无法最优地捕捉序列相似性。

Method: 评估九种核函数在t-SNE中的应用，使用三种嵌入方法（One-Hot Encoding、Spike2Vec和minimizers），通过主观可视化和客观指标（邻域保持分数）进行比较，并在六个生物数据集上进行分类和聚类实验验证。

Abstract: Dimensionality reduction techniques are essential for visualizing and analyzing high-dimensional biological sequencing data. t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) is widely used for this purpose, traditionally employing the Gaussian kernel to compute pairwise similarities. However, the Gaussian kernel's lack of data-dependence and computational overhead limit its scalability and effectiveness for categorical biological sequences. Recent work proposed the isolation kernel as an alternative, yet it may not optimally capture sequence similarities. In this study, we comprehensively evaluate nine different kernel functions for t-SNE applied to molecular sequences, using three embedding methods: One-Hot Encoding, Spike2Vec, and minimizers. Through both subjective visualization and objective metrics (including neighborhood preservation scores), we demonstrate that the cosine similarity kernel in general outperforms other kernels, including Gaussian and isolation kernels, achieving superior runtime efficiency and better preservation of pairwise distances in low-dimensional space. We further validate our findings through extensive classification and clustering experiments across six diverse biological datasets (Spike7k, Host, ShortRead, Rabies, Genome, and Breast Cancer), employing multiple machine learning algorithms and evaluation metrics. Our results show that kernel selection significantly impacts not only visualization quality but also downstream analytical tasks, with the cosine similarity kernel providing the most robust performance across different data types and embedding strategies, making it particularly suitable for large-scale biological sequence analysis.

Abstract: Symbolic regression (SR) has emerged as a powerful method for uncovering interpretable mathematical relationships from data, offering a novel route to both scientific discovery and efficient empirical modelling. This article introduces the Special Issue on Symbolic Regression for the Physical Sciences, motivated by the Royal Society discussion meeting held in April 2025. The contributions collected here span applications from automated equation discovery and emergent-phenomena modelling to the construction of compact emulators for computationally expensive simulations.
  The introductory review outlines the conceptual foundations of SR, contrasts it with conventional regression approaches, and surveys its main use cases in the physical sciences, including the derivation of effective theories, empirical functional forms and surrogate models. We summarise methodological considerations such as search-space design, operator selection, complexity control, feature selection, and integration with modern AI approaches. We also highlight ongoing challenges, including scalability, robustness to noise, overfitting and computational complexity. Finally we emphasise emerging directions, particularly the incorporation of symmetry constraints, asymptotic behaviour and other theoretical information. Taken together, the papers in this Special Issue illustrate the accelerating progress of SR and its growing relevance across the physical sciences.

Motivation: 当前离散序列建模（如DNA、蛋白质、语言）存在三种主要扩散方法：离散空间扩散、欧几里得空间高斯扩散和单纯形扩散。这些方法具有不同的算法、理论结构和权衡取舍，缺乏统一的理论框架，使得实践者难以在不同方法间切换。

Abstract: To model discrete sequences such as DNA, proteins, and language using diffusion, practitioners must choose between three major methods: diffusion in discrete space, Gaussian diffusion in Euclidean space, or diffusion on the simplex. Despite their shared goal, these models have disparate algorithms, theoretical structures, and tradeoffs: discrete diffusion has the most natural domain, Gaussian diffusion has more mature algorithms, and diffusion on the simplex in principle combines the strengths of the other two but in practice suffers from a numerically unstable stochastic processes. Ideally we could see each of these models as instances of the same underlying framework, and enable practitioners to switch between models for downstream applications. However previous theories have only considered connections in special cases. Here we build a theory unifying all three methods of discrete diffusion as different parameterizations of the same underlying process: the Wright-Fisher population genetics model. In particular, we find simplicial and Gaussian diffusion as two large-population limits. Our theory formally connects the likelihoods and hyperparameters of these models and leverages decades of mathematical genetics literature to unlock stable simplicial diffusion. Finally, we relieve the practitioner of balancing model trade-offs by demonstrating it is possible to train a single model that can perform diffusion in any of these three domains at test time. Our experiments show that Wright-Fisher simplicial diffusion is more stable and outperforms previous simplicial diffusion models on conditional DNA generation. We also show that we can train models on multiple domains at once that are competitive with models trained on any individual domain.

Abstract: Generative models are often deployed to make decisions on behalf of users, such as vision-language models (VLMs) identifying which person in a room is a doctor to help visually impaired individuals. Yet, VLM decisions are influenced by the perceived demographic attributes of people in the input, which can lead to biased outcomes like failing to identify women as doctors. Moreover, when reducing bias leads to performance loss, users may have varying needs for balancing bias mitigation with overall model capabilities, highlighting the demand for methods that enable controllable bias reduction during inference. Activation steering is a popular approach for inference-time controllability that has shown potential in inducing safer behavior in large language models (LLMs). However, we observe that current steering methods struggle to correct biases, where equiprobable outcomes across demographic groups are required. To address this, we propose Direct Steering Optimization (DSO) which uses reinforcement learning to find linear transformations for steering activations, tailored to mitigate bias while maintaining control over model performance. We demonstrate that DSO achieves state-of-the-art trade-off between fairness and capabilities on both VLMs and LLMs, while offering practitioners inference-time control over the trade-off. Overall, our work highlights the benefit of designing steering strategies that are directly optimized to control model behavior, providing more effective bias intervention than methods that rely on pre-defined heuristics for controllability.

Abstract: Accurate taxonomic classification from DNA barcodes is a cornerstone of global biodiversity monitoring, yet fungi present extreme challenges due to sparse labelling and long-tailed taxa distributions. Conventional supervised learning methods often falter in this domain, struggling to generalize to unseen species and to capture the hierarchical nature of the data. To address these limitations, we introduce BarcodeMamba+, a foundation model for fungal barcode classification built on a powerful and efficient state-space model architecture. We employ a pretrain and fine-tune paradigm, which utilizes partially labelled data and we demonstrate this is substantially more effective than traditional fully-supervised methods in this data-sparse environment. During fine-tuning, we systematically integrate and evaluate a suite of enhancements--including hierarchical label smoothing, a weighted loss function, and a multi-head output layer from MycoAI--to specifically tackle the challenges of fungal taxonomy. Our experiments show that each of these components yields significant performance gains. On a challenging fungal classification benchmark with distinct taxonomic distribution shifts from the broad training set, our final model outperforms a range of existing methods across all taxonomic levels. Our work provides a powerful new tool for genomics-based biodiversity research and establishes an effective and scalable training paradigm for this challenging domain.

Abstract: There has been significant recent interest in understanding the capacity of Transformers for in-context learning (ICL), yet most theory focuses on supervised settings with explicitly labeled pairs. In practice, Transformers often perform well even when labels are sparse or absent, suggesting crucial structure within unlabeled contextual demonstrations. We introduce and study in-context semi-supervised learning (IC-SSL), where a small set of labeled examples is accompanied by many unlabeled points, and show that Transformers can leverage the unlabeled context to learn a robust, context-dependent representation. This representation enables accurate predictions and markedly improves performance in low-label regimes, offering foundational insights into how Transformers exploit unlabeled context for representation learning within the ICL framework.

Abstract: Deep neural networks achieve impressive performance but remain difficult to interpret and control. We present SALVE (Sparse Autoencoder-Latent Vector Editing), a unified "discover, validate, and control" framework that bridges mechanistic interpretability and model editing. Using an $\ell_1$-regularized autoencoder, we learn a sparse, model-native feature basis without supervision. We validate these features with Grad-FAM, a feature-level saliency mapping method that visually grounds latent features in input data. Leveraging the autoencoder's structure, we perform precise and permanent weight-space interventions, enabling continuous modulation of both class-defining and cross-class features. We further derive a critical suppression threshold, $α_{crit}$, quantifying each class's reliance on its dominant feature, supporting fine-grained robustness diagnostics. Our approach is validated on both convolutional (ResNet-18) and transformer-based (ViT-B/16) models, demonstrating consistent, interpretable control over their behavior. This work contributes a principled methodology for turning feature discovery into actionable model edits, advancing the development of transparent and controllable AI systems.

Method: 收集决策树研究文献，将每个报告的预测因子分配到受监管的数据类别（如健康数据、生物识别标识符、儿童数据、财务属性、位置轨迹和政府ID），然后将每个类别与欧盟和美国隐私法中的具体条款联系起来。

Result: 研究发现许多报告的预测因子属于受监管类别，其中医疗保健领域占比最大，不同行业存在明显差异。分析了流行程度、行业构成和时间模式，并总结了每个法规框架参考年份下的监管对齐时机。

Conclusion: 研究结果支持隐私保护方法和治理检查的需求，这些发现可以为超越决策树的机器学习实践提供信息。

Abstract: Decision-tree methods are widely used on structured tabular data and are valued for interpretability across many sectors. However, published studies often list the predictors they use (for example age, diagnosis codes, location). Privacy laws increasingly regulate such data types. We use published decision-tree papers as a proxy for real-world use of legally governed data. We compile a corpus of decision-tree studies and assign each reported predictor to a regulated data category (for example health data, biometric identifiers, children's data, financial attributes, location traces, and government IDs). We then link each category to specific excerpts in European Union and United States privacy laws. We find that many reported predictors fall into regulated categories, with the largest shares in healthcare and clear differences across industries. We analyze prevalence, industry composition, and temporal patterns, and summarize regulation-aligned timing using each framework's reference year. Our evidence supports privacy-preserving methods and governance checks, and can inform ML practice beyond decision trees.

TL;DR: 提出一种基于商品RFID的森林资产追踪方法，无需预先标记已知位置即可达到GPS级别的定位精度


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在森林环境中，商品RFID系统由于信号衰减、多径效应和环境变化导致标签定位困难。现有指纹识别方法需要预先在已知位置部署标签，这在某些应用场景中不可行。

Method: 使用高斯过程建模不同环境的RF信号响应特征，无需GPS或摄像头等额外传感器。提出加权对数似然方法将未知环境与预先建模的环境字典进行匹配。

Result: 能够达到GPS级别的定位精度，可同时追踪数十个野火响应资产，无需预先标记已知位置，成本远低于GPS系统。

Conclusion: 该方法为森林环境中的资产追踪提供了一种成本效益高、可扩展的解决方案，特别适用于野火响应等应用场景。

Abstract: This paper presents a novel, cost-effective, and scalable approach to track numerous assets distributed in forested environments using commodity Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) targeting wildfire response applications. Commodity RFID systems suffer from poor tag localization when dispersed in forested environments due to signal attenuation, multi-path effects and environmental variability. Current methods to address this issue via fingerprinting rely on dispersing tags at known locations {\em a priori}. In this paper, we address the case when it is not possible to tag known locations and show that it is possible to localize tags to accuracies comparable to global positioning systems (GPS) without such a constraint. For this, we propose Gaussian Process to model various environments solely based on RF signal response signatures and without the aid of additional sensors such as global positioning GPS or cameras, and match an unknown RF to the closest match in a model dictionary. We utilize a new weighted log-likelihood method to associate an unknown environment with the closest environment in a dictionary of previously modeled environments, which is a crucial step in being able to use our approach. Our results show that it is possible to achieve localization accuracies of the order of GPS, but with passive commodity RFID, which will allow the tracking of dozens of wildfire assets within the vicinity of mobile readers at-a-time simultaneously, does not require known positions to be tagged {\em a priori}, and can achieve localization at a fraction of the cost compared to GPS.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DR-RL是一种动态低秩强化学习框架，通过强化学习和在线矩阵扰动理论自适应优化大语言模型中多头自注意力的低秩分解，在保持准确性的同时显著减少计算量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统低秩近似方法通常采用静态秩假设，在不同输入上下文和硬件约束下缺乏灵活性，需要一种能够动态适应序列动态、层敏感性和计算限制的自适应方法。

Method: 提出基于强化学习的动态秩选择框架，将秩选择建模为序列策略优化问题，奖励函数平衡注意力保真度和计算延迟；采用在线矩阵扰动理论实现增量秩更新，避免推理时的全分解成本；结合轻量级Transformer策略网络和批量SVD操作。

Result: 实验表明DR-RL在保持与全秩注意力统计等效的下游准确性的同时，显著减少浮点运算（FLOPs），特别是在长序列（L>4096）场景下效果显著。

Conclusion: 该工作弥合了MHSA自适应效率与理论严谨性之间的差距，为资源受限深度学习中的启发式秩缩减技术提供了有原则、数学基础扎实的替代方案。

Abstract: We propose Dynamic Rank Reinforcement Learning (DR-RL), a novel framework that adaptively optimizes the low-rank factorization of Multi-Head Self-Attention (MHSA) in Large Language Models (LLMs) through the integration of reinforcement learning and online matrix perturbation theory. While traditional low-rank approximations often rely on static rank assumptions--limiting their flexibility across diverse input contexts--our method dynamically selects ranks based on real-time sequence dynamics, layer-specific sensitivities, and hardware constraints. The core innovation lies in an RL agent that formulates rank selection as a sequential policy optimization problem, where the reward function strictly balances attention fidelity against computational latency. Crucially, we employ online matrix perturbation bounds to enable incremental rank updates, thereby avoiding the prohibitive cost of full decomposition during inference. Furthermore, the integration of a lightweight Transformer-based policy network and batched Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) operations ensures scalable deployment on modern GPU architectures. Experiments demonstrate that DR-RL maintains downstream accuracy statistically equivalent to full-rank attention while significantly reducing Floating Point Operations (FLOPs), particularly in long-sequence regimes (L > 4096). This work bridges the gap between adaptive efficiency and theoretical rigor in MHSA, offering a principled, mathematically grounded alternative to heuristic rank reduction techniques in resource-constrained deep learning.

TL;DR: 提出一种高效查询算法，能从噪声oracle访问中恢复叠加特征方向和非退化响应函数，适用于任意叠加和一般响应函数


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 复杂机器学习模型通常通过线性表示编码特征，但这些特征以叠加形式存在，难以恢复。特别是在过完备机制（特征数大于维度）下，传统算法面临挑战

Method: 通过噪声oracle访问函数f，在傅里叶空间中迭代细化搜索空间来定位隐藏方向vi，算法能处理任意叠加和一般响应函数，仅要求不同特征方向不近似相同

Result: 开发出高效查询算法，能识别所有非退化响应的特征方向并重构函数f，相比先前结果适用于更一般的设置

Conclusion: 该算法为学习叠加特征提供了有效解决方案，突破了过完备机制下的算法挑战，具有广泛适用性

Abstract: It is widely believed that complex machine learning models generally encode features through linear representations, but these features exist in superposition, making them challenging to recover. We study the following fundamental setting for learning features in superposition from black-box query access: we are given query access to a function \[ f(x)=\sum_{i=1}^n a_i\,σ_i(v_i^\top x), \] where each unit vector $v_i$ encodes a feature direction and $σ_i:\mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ is an arbitrary response function and our goal is to recover the $v_i$ and the function $f$.
  In learning-theoretic terms, superposition refers to the overcomplete regime, when the number of features is larger than the underlying dimension (i.e. $n > d$), which has proven especially challenging for typical algorithmic approaches. Our main result is an efficient query algorithm that, from noisy oracle access to $f$, identifies all feature directions whose responses are non-degenerate and reconstructs the function $f$. Crucially, our algorithm works in a significantly more general setting than all related prior results -- we allow for essentially arbitrary superpositions, only requiring that $v_i, v_j$ are not nearly identical for $i \neq j$, and general response functions $σ_i$. At a high level, our algorithm introduces an approach for searching in Fourier space by iteratively refining the search space to locate the hidden directions $v_i$.

Method: 1) 引入灵活、高阶且计算成本低的有限差分格式；2) 提出Rollout损失函数，训练降阶模型在任意时间范围内做出准确预测。

Result: 在2D Burgers方程上验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法能够显著提升降阶模型在长时间预测中的性能，为复杂PDE求解提供更可靠的快速近似。

Abstract: Solving complex partial differential equations is vital in the physical sciences, but often requires computationally expensive numerical methods. Reduced-order models (ROMs) address this by exploiting dimensionality reduction to create fast approximations. While modern ROMs can solve parameterized families of PDEs, their predictive power degrades over long time horizons. We address this by (1) introducing a flexible, high-order, yet inexpensive finite-difference scheme and (2) proposing a Rollout loss that trains ROMs to make accurate predictions over arbitrary time horizons. We demonstrate our approach on the 2D Burgers equation.

Conclusion: 这项工作展示了硬件感知神经架构搜索在资源受限部署中的潜力，并提供了一个开源框架来自动化设计高效的FPGA加速模型。

Abstract: Neural Architecture Search is a powerful approach for automating model design, but existing methods struggle to accurately optimize for real hardware performance, often relying on proxy metrics such as bit operations. We present Surrogate Neural Architecture Codesign Package (SNAC-Pack), an integrated framework that automates the discovery and optimization of neural networks focusing on FPGA deployment. SNAC-Pack combines Neural Architecture Codesign's multi-stage search capabilities with the Resource Utilization and Latency Estimator, enabling multi-objective optimization across accuracy, FPGA resource utilization, and latency without requiring time-intensive synthesis for each candidate model. We demonstrate SNAC-Pack on a high energy physics jet classification task, achieving 63.84% accuracy with resource estimation. When synthesized on a Xilinx Virtex UltraScale+ VU13P FPGA, the SNAC-Pack model matches baseline accuracy while maintaining comparable resource utilization to models optimized using traditional BOPs metrics. This work demonstrates the potential of hardware-aware neural architecture search for resource-constrained deployments and provides an open-source framework for automating the design of efficient FPGA-accelerated models.

TL;DR: FTBSC-KGML是一个结合预训练-微调、空间变异感知和知识引导的机器学习框架，用于准确量化农业生态系统碳循环，通过利用迁移学习和空间异质性提高区域适应性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在决策相关尺度上准确且经济地量化农业生态系统碳循环对气候缓解和可持续农业至关重要。传统方法依赖位置无关的参数化和独立训练，未能充分利用迁移学习和空间异质性，限制了在变异显著区域的适用性。

Method: 提出FTBSC-KGML框架，结合预训练-微调过程、空间变异感知和知识引导机器学习。使用遥感GPP、气候和土壤协变量在多站点进行预训练，然后针对各州或站点进行微调，学习位置感知表示，同时保持可解释性。

Result: FTBSC-KGML相比纯全局模型具有更低的验证误差和更高的解释力一致性，能更好地捕捉跨州的空间变异性，在有限数据下提高局部准确性而不牺牲可解释性。

Conclusion: 该工作扩展了先前的SDSA-KGML框架，通过预训练-微调和空间变异感知的迁移学习方案，为农业生态系统碳循环量化提供了更准确、适应性更强的解决方案。

Abstract: Accurate and cost-effective quantification of the agroecosystem carbon cycle at decision-relevant scales is essential for climate mitigation and sustainable agriculture. However, both transfer learning and the exploitation of spatial variability in this field are challenging, as they involve heterogeneous data and complex cross-scale dependencies. Conventional approaches often rely on location-independent parameterizations and independent training, underutilizing transfer learning and spatial heterogeneity in the inputs, and limiting their applicability in regions with substantial variability. We propose FTBSC-KGML (Fine-Tuning-Based Site Calibration-Knowledge-Guided Machine Learning), a pretraining- and fine-tuning-based, spatial-variability-aware, and knowledge-guided machine learning framework that augments KGML-ag with a pretraining-fine-tuning process and site-specific parameters. Using a pretraining-fine-tuning process with remote-sensing GPP, climate, and soil covariates collected across multiple midwestern sites, FTBSC-KGML estimates land emissions while leveraging transfer learning and spatial heterogeneity. A key component is a spatial-heterogeneity-aware transfer-learning scheme, which is a globally pretrained model that is fine-tuned at each state or site to learn place-aware representations, thereby improving local accuracy under limited data without sacrificing interpretability. Empirically, FTBSC-KGML achieves lower validation error and greater consistency in explanatory power than a purely global model, thereby better capturing spatial variability across states. This work extends the prior SDSA-KGML framework.

Motivation: 热管微反应器适合偏远地区供电，但存在规模不经济问题，财务可行性不足，需要早期设计阶段就考虑经济与物理分析

Method: 使用随机样本训练高斯过程和多层感知机代理模型，然后部署在强化学习优化框架中，优化平准化电力成本，同时约束燃料寿命、停堆裕度、峰值热通量和棒积分峰值因子

Result: 运行维护成本和资本成本是平准化电力成本的主要贡献者，优化器巧妙调整设计参数，在满足约束条件下将平准化电力成本降低超过57%

Conclusion: 该方法有效整合技术经济考量，未来将进行燃料和热管性能与多目标优化的全面集成，以深入理解约束与成本性能的相互作用

Abstract: Microreactors, particularly heat-pipe microreactors (HPMRs), are compact, transportable, self-regulated power systems well-suited for access-challenged remote areas where costly fossil fuels dominate. However, they suffer from diseconomies of scale, and their financial viability remains unconvincing. One step in addressing this shortcoming is to design these reactors with comprehensive economic and physics analyses informing early-stage design iteration. In this work, we present a novel unifying geometric design optimization approach that accounts for techno-economic considerations. We start by generating random samples to train surrogate models, including Gaussian processes (GPs) and multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs). We then deploy these surrogates within a reinforcement learning (RL)-based optimization framework to optimize the levelized cost of electricity (LCOE), all the while imposing constraints on the fuel lifetime, shutdown margin (SDM), peak heat flux, and rod-integrated peaking factor. We study two cases: one in which the axial reflector cost is very high, and one in which it is inexpensive. We found that the operation and maintenance and capital costs are the primary contributors to the overall LCOE particularly the cost of the axial reflectors (for the first case) and the control drum materials. The optimizer cleverly changes the design parameters so as to minimize one of them while still satisfying the constraints, ultimately reducing the LCOE by more than 57% in both instances. A comprehensive integration of fuel and HP performance with multi-objective optimization is currently being pursued to fully understand the interaction between constraints and cost performance.

Abstract: Big Data has become central to modern applications in finance, insurance, and cybersecurity, enabling machine learning systems to perform large-scale risk assessments and fraud detection. However, the increasing dependence on automated analytics introduces important concerns about transparency, regulatory compliance, and trust. This paper examines how explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) can be integrated into Big Data analytics pipelines for fraud detection and risk management. We review key Big Data characteristics and survey major analytical tools, including distributed storage systems, streaming platforms, and advanced fraud detection models such as anomaly detectors, graph-based approaches, and ensemble classifiers. We also present a structured review of widely used XAI methods, including LIME, SHAP, counterfactual explanations, and attention mechanisms, and analyze their strengths and limitations when deployed at scale. Based on these findings, we identify key research gaps related to scalability, real-time processing, and explainability for graph and temporal models. To address these challenges, we outline a conceptual framework that integrates scalable Big Data infrastructure with context-aware explanation mechanisms and human feedback. The paper concludes with open research directions in scalable XAI, privacy-aware explanations, and standardized evaluation methods for explainable fraud detection systems.

Conclusion: CauStream为因果时空建模提供了理论基础，能够扩展到广泛的科学和环境应用中，在保持物理可解释性的同时提升预测性能

Abstract: Streamflow forecasting is crucial for water resource management and risk mitigation. While deep learning models have achieved strong predictive performance, they often overlook underlying physical processes, limiting interpretability and generalization. Recent causal learning approaches address these issues by integrating domain knowledge, yet they typically rely on fixed causal graphs that fail to adapt to data. We propose CauStream, a unified framework for causal spatiotemporal streamflow forecasting. CauSTream jointly learns (i) a runoff causal graph among meteorological forcings and (ii) a routing graph capturing dynamic dependencies across stations. We further establish identifiability conditions for these causal structures under a nonparametric setting. We evaluate CauSTream on three major U.S. river basins across three forecasting horizons. The model consistently outperforms prior state-of-the-art methods, with performance gaps widening at longer forecast windows, indicating stronger generalization to unseen conditions. Beyond forecasting, CauSTream also learns causal graphs that capture relationships among hydrological factors and stations. The inferred structures align closely with established domain knowledge, offering interpretable insights into watershed dynamics. CauSTream offers a principled foundation for causal spatiotemporal modeling, with the potential to extend to a wide range of scientific and environmental applications.

Abstract: In-context Learning (ICL) is the remarkable capability displayed by some machine learning models to learn from examples in a prompt, without any further weight updates. ICL had originally been thought to emerge from the self-attention mechanism in autoregressive transformer architectures. DeepOSets is a non-autoregressive, non-attention based neural architecture that combines set learning via the DeepSets architecture with operator learning via Deep Operator Networks (DeepONets). In a previous study, DeepOSets was shown to display ICL capabilities in supervised learning problems. In this paper, we show that the DeepOSets architecture, with the appropriate modifications, is a multi-operator in-context learner that can recover the solution operator of a new PDE, not seen during training, from example pairs of parameter and solution placed in a user prompt, without any weight updates. Furthermore, we show that DeepOSets is a universal uniform approximator over a class of continuous operators, which we believe is the first result of its kind in the literature of scientific machine learning. This means that a single DeepOSets architecture exists that approximates in-context any continuous operator in the class to any fixed desired degree accuracy, given an appropriate number of examples in the prompt. Experiments with Poisson and reaction-diffusion forward and inverse boundary-value problems demonstrate the ability of the proposed model to use in-context examples to predict accurately the solutions corresponding to parameter queries for PDEs not seen during training.

Motivation: 图像数据常包含人脸、车牌等隐私信息，需要在不泄露隐私的前提下保持数据对模型训练的有用性。当前业界标准的高斯模糊方法在实际应用中存在隐私风险。

Method: 比较了四种隐私保护算法：高斯模糊、像素化、像素化加噪声（DP-Pix）和裁剪。通过反转攻击和识别攻击评估隐私性，通过在模糊化数据上训练模型的表示质量评估效用性。

Result: 高斯模糊在实际低精度实现中最不隐私，容易受到反转攻击；像素化和像素化加噪声在适当粒度下能同时提供隐私保护和模型训练效用。

Conclusion: 业界标准的高斯模糊方法隐私保护不足，建议使用像素化或像素化加噪声方法，并开发了Privacy Blur软件包提供这些方法及参数建议。

Abstract: Image data collected in the wild often contains private information such as faces and license plates, and responsible data release must ensure that this information stays hidden. At the same time, released data should retain its usefulness for model-training. The standard method for private information obfuscation in images is Gaussian blurring. In this work, we show that practical implementations of Gaussian blurring are reversible enough to break privacy. We then take a closer look at the privacy-utility tradeoffs offered by three other obfuscation algorithms -- pixelization, pixelization and noise addition (DP-Pix), and cropping. Privacy is evaluated by reversal and discrimination attacks, while utility by the quality of the learnt representations when the model is trained on data with obfuscated faces. We show that the most popular industry-standard method, Gaussian blur is the least private of the four -- being susceptible to reversal attacks in its practical low-precision implementations. In contrast, pixelization and pixelization plus noise addition, when used at the right level of granularity, offer both privacy and utility for a number of computer vision tasks. We make our proposed methods together with suggested parameters available in a software package called Privacy Blur.

Motivation: 市场操纵越来越多地源自协调的社交媒体活动而非孤立交易，零售投资者、监管机构和经纪商需要能够连接在线叙事、协调模式与市场行为的工具。

Method: 开发AIMM框架，融合Reddit活动、机器人与协调指标以及OHLCV市场特征，使用parquet-native流水线和Streamlit仪表板，通过校准的合成社交特征匹配事件特征。

Result: 构建了包含33个标记股票日的AIMM-GT数据集，实现了前瞻性预测日志记录，AIMM在GME事件中提前22天发出预警，显示出初步的判别能力。

Conclusion: AIMM框架为社交媒体驱动的市场监控提供了初步工具，尽管标记数据集较小，但展示了早期预警能力，并开源代码、数据集架构和仪表板设计以支持进一步研究。

Abstract: Market manipulation now routinely originates from coordinated social media campaigns, not isolated trades. Retail investors, regulators, and brokerages need tools that connect online narratives and coordination patterns to market behavior. We present AIMM, an AI-driven framework that fuses Reddit activity, bot and coordination indicators, and OHLCV market features into a daily AIMM Manipulation Risk Score for each ticker.
  The system uses a parquet-native pipeline with a Streamlit dashboard that allows analysts to explore suspicious windows, inspect underlying posts and price action, and log model outputs over time. Due to Reddit API restrictions, we employ calibrated synthetic social features matching documented event characteristics; market data (OHLCV) uses real historical data from Yahoo Finance. This release makes three contributions. First, we build the AIMM Ground Truth dataset (AIMM-GT): 33 labeled ticker-days spanning eight equities, drawing from SEC enforcement actions, community-verified manipulation cases, and matched normal controls. Second, we implement forward-walk evaluation and prospective prediction logging for both retrospective and deployment-style assessment. Third, we analyze lead times and show that AIMM flagged GME 22 days before the January 2021 squeeze peak.
  The current labeled set is small (33 ticker-days, 3 positive events), but results show preliminary discriminative capability and early warnings for the GME incident. We release the code, dataset schema, and dashboard design to support research on social media-driven market surveillance.

Abstract: Learning the structure of directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) from observational data is a central problem in causal discovery, statistical signal processing, and machine learning. Under a linear Gaussian structural equation model (SEM) with equal noise variances, the problem is identifiable and we show that the ensemble precision matrix of the observations exhibits a distinctive structure that facilitates DAG recovery. Exploiting this property, we propose BUILD (Bottom-Up Inference of Linear DAGs), a deterministic stepwise algorithm that identifies leaf nodes and their parents, then prunes the leaves by removing incident edges to proceed to the next step, exactly reconstructing the DAG from the true precision matrix. In practice, precision matrices must be estimated from finite data, and ill-conditioning may lead to error accumulation across BUILD steps. As a mitigation strategy, we periodically re-estimate the precision matrix (with less variables as leaves are pruned), trading off runtime for enhanced robustness. Reproducible results on challenging synthetic benchmarks demonstrate that BUILD compares favorably to state-of-the-art DAG learning algorithms, while offering an explicit handle on complexity.

TL;DR: 论文首次揭示了机器遗忘在双视图设置下的隐私风险，提出DVIA攻击方法，证明攻击者通过查询原始模型和遗忘模型可以获得比单独查询任一模型更多的隐私信息。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机器遗忘技术虽然能保护请求遗忘的用户权利，但引入了新的隐私风险。先前研究主要关注已遗忘数据的隐私，而对保留数据的隐私风险研究不足。本文旨在填补这一空白，首次揭示机器遗忘在双视图设置下的隐私漏洞。

Method: 从信息论角度引入"隐私知识增益"概念，证明双视图设置能让攻击者获得更多信息。提出DVIA（双视图推理攻击）方法，通过黑盒查询两个模型，使用轻量级似然比推理模块提取保留数据的成员信息，无需训练攻击模型。

Result: 在不同数据集和模型架构上的实验验证了DVIA的有效性，并突显了双视图设置固有的隐私风险。攻击者通过查询两个模型能获得比单独查询任一模型更多的隐私信息。

Conclusion: 机器遗忘在双视图设置下会放大隐私泄露风险，保留数据面临新的威胁。DVIA攻击方法有效揭示了这一风险，为机器遗忘系统的隐私保护设计提供了重要启示。

Abstract: Machine unlearning is a newly popularized technique for removing specific training data from a trained model, enabling it to comply with data deletion requests. While it protects the rights of users requesting unlearning, it also introduces new privacy risks. Prior works have primarily focused on the privacy of data that has been unlearned, while the risks to retained data remain largely unexplored. To address this gap, we focus on the privacy risks of retained data and, for the first time, reveal the vulnerabilities introduced by machine unlearning under the dual-view setting, where an adversary can query both the original and the unlearned models. From an information-theoretic perspective, we introduce the concept of {privacy knowledge gain} and demonstrate that the dual-view setting allows adversaries to obtain more information than querying either model alone, thereby amplifying privacy leakage. To effectively demonstrate this threat, we propose DVIA, a Dual-View Inference Attack, which extracts membership information on retained data using black-box queries to both models. DVIA eliminates the need to train an attack model and employs a lightweight likelihood ratio inference module for efficient inference. Experiments across different datasets and model architectures validate the effectiveness of DVIA and highlight the privacy risks inherent in the dual-view setting.

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种基于图神经网络的多模态框架，通过分析手绘立方体草图来检测阿尔茨海默病，将手绘转换为图结构表示，并结合人口统计信息和神经心理学测试分数进行分类。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 阿尔茨海默病的早期和可及性检测仍是临床挑战，立方体复制任务能简单有效地评估视觉空间功能，但需要更系统化的分析方法。

Method: 将手绘立方体草图转换为图结构表示，提取几何和拓扑特征，使用图神经网络处理，并与年龄、教育程度、神经心理学测试分数等多模态特征进行后期融合。

Result: 图表示方法显著优于基于像素的卷积模型，多模态集成进一步提升了性能和对类别不平衡的鲁棒性，SHAP分析识别出特定的图基序和几何畸变作为关键预测因子。

Conclusion: 基于图的立方体复制分析为阿尔茨海默病筛查提供了一种可解释、非侵入性且可扩展的方法，与临床观察到的AD患者立方体绘制混乱现象一致。

Abstract: Early and accessible detection of Alzheimer's disease (AD) remains a critical clinical challenge, and cube-copying tasks offer a simple yet informative assessment of visuospatial function. This work proposes a multimodal framework that converts hand-drawn cube sketches into graph-structured representations capturing geometric and topological properties, and integrates these features with demographic information and neuropsychological test (NPT) scores for AD classification. Cube drawings are modeled as graphs with node features encoding spatial coordinates, local graphlet-based topology, and angular geometry, which are processed using graph neural networks and fused with age, education, and NPT features in a late-fusion model. Experimental results show that graph-based representations provide a strong unimodal baseline and substantially outperform pixel-based convolutional models, while multimodal integration further improves performance and robustness to class imbalance. SHAP-based interpretability analysis identifies specific graphlet motifs and geometric distortions as key predictors, closely aligning with clinical observations of disorganized cube drawings in AD. Together, these results establish graph-based analysis of cube copying as an interpretable, non-invasive, and scalable approach for Alzheimer's disease screening.

TL;DR: stMFG提出了一种多尺度交互融合图网络，通过层间跨视图注意力动态整合空间和基因特征，结合跨视图对比学习和空间约束，在空间转录组学中显著提升了空间域识别的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 空间转录组学能在原生组织环境中进行全基因组表达分析，但由于复杂的基因-空间相互作用，识别空间域仍然具有挑战性。现有方法通常单独处理空间和特征视图，仅在输出层面融合，这种"分别编码、后期融合"的范式限制了多尺度语义捕获和跨视图交互。

Method: stMFG是一种多尺度交互融合图网络，引入层间跨视图注意力机制，在每次卷积后动态整合空间和基因特征。模型结合跨视图对比学习和空间约束，以增强区分能力同时保持空间连续性。

Result: 在DLPFC和乳腺癌数据集上，stMFG优于现有最先进方法，在某些切片上实现了高达14%的ARI（调整兰德指数）提升。

Conclusion: stMFG通过层间跨视图融合机制有效解决了空间转录组学中空间域识别的挑战，为复杂基因-空间相互作用的建模提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Spatial transcriptomics enables genome-wide expression analysis within native tissue context, yet identifying spatial domains remains challenging due to complex gene-spatial interactions. Existing methods typically process spatial and feature views separately, fusing only at output level - an "encode-separately, fuse-late" paradigm that limits multi-scale semantic capture and cross-view interaction. Accordingly, stMFG is proposed, a multi-scale interactive fusion graph network that introduces layer-wise cross-view attention to dynamically integrate spatial and gene features after each convolution. The model combines cross-view contrastive learning with spatial constraints to enhance discriminability while maintaining spatial continuity. On DLPFC and breast cancer datasets, stMFG outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving up to 14% ARI improvement on certain slices.

TL;DR: 本文首次为基于排序的零阶优化算法建立了显式的非渐进查询复杂度界限，填补了理论空白。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于排序的零阶优化方法（如CMA-ES、自然进化策略等）在实践中广泛成功，但理论理解有限。现有分析仅提供渐进性见解，无法给出选择top-k方向的算法的显式收敛速率。

Method: 分析一个简单的基于排序的零阶算法，采用新颖的分析方法，避免传统的漂移和信息几何技术。

Result: 对于d维问题：强凸平滑函数达到Õ(dL/μ·log(dL/μδ)·log(1/ε))查询复杂度；非凸平滑函数达到O(dL/ε·log(1/ε))查询复杂度。这些结果以至少1-δ的概率成立。

Conclusion: 首次为基于排序的零阶优化建立了显式非渐进查询复杂度，为理解基于排序的启发式方法为何能实现高效零阶优化提供了新见解。

Abstract: Rank-based zeroth-order (ZO) optimization -- which relies only on the ordering of function evaluations -- offers strong robustness to noise and monotone transformations, and underlies many successful algorithms such as CMA-ES, natural evolution strategies, and rank-based genetic algorithms. Despite its widespread use, the theoretical understanding of rank-based ZO methods remains limited: existing analyses provide only asymptotic insights and do not yield explicit convergence rates for algorithms selecting the top-$k$ directions.
  This work closes this gap by analyzing a simple rank-based ZO algorithm and establishing the first \emph{explicit}, and \emph{non-asymptotic} query complexities. For a $d$-dimension problem, if the function is $L$-smooth and $μ$-strongly convex, the algorithm achieves $\widetilde{\mathcal O}\!\left(\frac{dL}μ\log\!\frac{dL}{μδ}\log\!\frac{1}{\varepsilon}\right)$ to find an $\varepsilon$-suboptimal solution, and for smooth nonconvex objectives it reaches $\mathcal O\!\left(\frac{dL}{\varepsilon}\log\!\frac{1}{\varepsilon}\right)$. Notation $\cO(\cdot)$ hides constant terms and $\widetilde{\mathcal O}(\cdot)$ hides extra $\log\log\frac{1}{\varepsilon}$ term. These query complexities hold with a probability at least $1-δ$ with $0<δ<1$. The analysis in this paper is novel and avoids classical drift and information-geometric techniques. Our analysis offers new insight into why rank-based heuristics lead to efficient ZO optimization.

Abstract: Predicting geohazard runout is critical for protecting lives, infrastructure and ecosystems. Rapid mass flows, including landslides and avalanches, cause several thousand deaths across a wide range of environments, often travelling many kilometres from their source. The wide range of source conditions and material properties governing these flows makes their runout difficult to anticipate, particularly for downstream communities that may be suddenly exposed to severe impacts. Accurately predicting runout at scale requires models that are both physically realistic and computationally efficient, yet existing approaches face a fundamental speed-realism trade-off. Here we train a machine learning model to predict geohazard runout across representative real world terrains. The model predicts both flow extent and deposit thickness with high accuracy and 100 to 10,000 times faster computation than numerical solvers. It is trained on over 100,000 numerical simulations across over 10,000 real world digital elevation model chips and reproduces key physical behaviours, including avulsion and deposition patterns, while generalizing across different flow types, sizes and landscapes. Our results demonstrate that neural emulation enables rapid, spatially resolved runout prediction across diverse real world terrains, opening new opportunities for disaster risk reduction and impact-based forecasting. These results highlight neural emulation as a promising pathway for extending physically realistic geohazard modelling to spatial and temporal scales relevant for large scale early warning systems.

TL;DR: 提出CFC框架，利用大语言模型进行图数据集的开放集分类，实现从粗到细的OOD检测与分类，无需真实标签信息。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法将OOD样本视为单一类别，但实际应用（如欺诈检测、医疗诊断）需要更深入了解OOD样本的可能标签。需要在不依赖真实标签的情况下扩展OOD检测到OOD分类。

Method: CFC框架包含三个组件：1) 粗分类器使用LLM提示进行OOD检测和异常标签生成；2) GNN细分类器利用粗分类器识别的OOD样本训练，增强OOD检测和ID分类；3) 通过LLM提示和后处理的OOD标签实现精细化OOD分类。

Result: CFC在图和文本领域的OOD检测性能比最先进方法提升10%，在图数据集上的OOD分类准确率达到70%。

Conclusion: CFC框架成功实现了无需真实标签的OOD分类，利用语义OOD实例提高了可解释性和实用性，为开放世界图神经网络部署提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Developing open-set classification methods capable of classifying in-distribution (ID) data while detecting out-of-distribution (OOD) samples is essential for deploying graph neural networks (GNNs) in open-world scenarios. Existing methods typically treat all OOD samples as a single class, despite real-world applications, especially high-stake settings such as fraud detection and medical diagnosis, demanding deeper insights into OOD samples, including their probable labels. This raises a critical question: can OOD detection be extended to OOD classification without true label information? To address this question, we propose a Coarse-to-Fine open-set Classification (CFC) framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) for graph datasets. CFC consists of three key components: a coarse classifier that uses LLM prompts for OOD detection and outlier label generation, a GNN-based fine classifier trained with OOD samples identified by the coarse classifier for enhanced OOD detection and ID classification, and refined OOD classification achieved through LLM prompts and post-processed OOD labels. Unlike methods that rely on synthetic or auxiliary OOD samples, CFC employs semantic OOD instances that are genuinely out-of-distribution based on their inherent meaning, improving interpretability and practical utility. Experimental results show that CFC improves OOD detection by ten percent over state-of-the-art methods on graph and text domains and achieves up to seventy percent accuracy in OOD classification on graph datasets.

Conclusion: SEAL算法通过锐度感知优化和表示相关性正则化，有效解决了联邦图学习中的数据异质性问题，提升了局部GNN模型的分类精度和泛化能力。

Abstract: One of many impediments to applying graph neural networks (GNNs) to large-scale real-world graph data is the challenge of centralized training, which requires aggregating data from different organizations, raising privacy concerns. Federated graph learning (FGL) addresses this by enabling collaborative GNN model training without sharing private data. However, a core challenge in FGL systems is the variation in local training data distributions among clients, known as the data heterogeneity problem. Most existing solutions suffer from two problems: (1) The typical optimizer based on empirical risk minimization tends to cause local models to fall into sharp valleys and weakens their generalization to out-of-distribution graph data. (2) The prevalent dimensional collapse in the learned representations of local graph data has an adverse impact on the classification capacity of the GNN model. To this end, we formulate a novel optimization objective that is aware of the sharpness (i.e., the curvature of the loss surface) of local GNN models. By minimizing the loss function and its sharpness simultaneously, we seek out model parameters in a flat region with uniformly low loss values, thus improving the generalization over heterogeneous data. By introducing a regularizer based on the correlation matrix of local representations, we relax the correlations of representations generated by individual local graph samples, so as to alleviate the dimensional collapse of the learned model. The proposed \textbf{S}harpness-aware f\textbf{E}derated gr\textbf{A}ph \textbf{L}earning (SEAL) algorithm can enhance the classification accuracy and generalization ability of local GNN models in federated graph learning. Experimental studies on several graph classification benchmarks show that SEAL consistently outperforms SOTA FGL baselines and provides gains for more participants.

Result: 在多个工业数据集上的实验表明，所提出的模型始终优于最先进的基线方法

Conclusion: SSLF模型通过结合二阶信息和锐度感知优化，有效解决了SLF模型的优化困难问题，提升了性能

Abstract: Second-order Latent Factor (SLF) model, a class of low-rank representation learning methods, has proven effective at extracting node-to-node interaction patterns from High-dimensional and Incomplete (HDI) data. However, its optimization is notoriously difficult due to its bilinear and non-convex nature. Sharpness-aware Minimization (SAM) has recently proposed to find flat local minima when minimizing non-convex objectives, thereby improving the generalization of representation-learning models. To address this challenge, we propose a Sharpness-aware SLF (SSLF) model. SSLF embodies two key ideas: (1) acquiring second-order information via Hessian-vector products; and (2) injecting a sharpness term into the curvature (Hessian) through the designed Hessian-vector products. Experiments on multiple industrial datasets demonstrate that the proposed model consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines.

Abstract: Current mainstream post-training quantization methods for large language models typically apply a uniform quantization strategy across all network layers, overlooking the substantial differences in algorithmic suitability among layers. To address this limitation, we propose CKA Guided Modular Quantization, a fine-tuning-free, plug-and-play framework for algorithmic heterogeneous quantization. Our method independently evaluates multiple PTQ algorithms on each layer and employs Linear Centered Kernel Alignment (CKA) as a metric to automatically select the optimal quantization strategy per layer. The individually optimized strategies are then integrated to construct a hybrid quantized model. Experiments demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms both uniform quantization baselines and state-of-the-art mixed-precision methods across mainstream LLMs including LLaMA and Qwen ,in terms of perplexity (PPL) and downstream task performance.

TL;DR: SRMU是一种新的激活编辑框架，通过特征感知和方向控制的扰动，在高度纠缠的数据分布下实现选择性知识遗忘，在保持模型整体效用的同时有效移除有害知识。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型在安全关键和受监管领域的应用增加，模型中保留的敏感或禁止知识带来了隐私泄露、监管不合规和潜在滥用的风险。现有遗忘技术假设遗忘集和保留集完全分离，但在实际应用中数据分布高度纠缠，导致现有方法效果不佳或损害模型效用。

Method: 提出选择性表征误导遗忘（SRMU）框架，采用结构化的误导向量和激活重要性映射，进行特征感知和方向控制的激活编辑扰动。与不加区分的权重扰动不同，SRMU选择性地抑制有害表征，同时保留良性表征的效用。

Result: 在WMDP基准测试中，SRMU在低和高纠缠配置下均实现了最先进的遗忘性能，且效用损失最小。在20-30%数据重叠的情况下仍保持有效，而现有基线方法失效。SRMU为安全驱动的模型治理提供了稳健基础。

Conclusion: SRMU为解决高度纠缠数据分布下的知识遗忘问题提供了有效方案，能够在保持模型整体效用的同时确保安全合规，适用于新兴的LLM应用中隐私合规和受控知识移除的需求。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly adopted in safety-critical and regulated sectors, the retention of sensitive or prohibited knowledge introduces escalating risks, ranging from privacy leakage to regulatory non-compliance to to potential misuse, and so on. Recent studies suggest that machine unlearning can help ensure deployed models comply with evolving legal, safety, and governance requirements. However, current unlearning techniques assume clean separation between forget and retain datasets, which is challenging in operational settings characterized by highly entangled distributions. In such scenarios, perturbation-based methods often degrade general model utility or fail to ensure safety. To address this, we propose Selective Representation Misdirection for Unlearning (SRMU), a novel principled activation-editing framework that enforces feature-aware and directionally controlled perturbations. Unlike indiscriminate model weights perturbations, SRMU employs a structured misdirection vector with an activation importance map. The goal is to allow SRMU selectively suppresses harmful representations while preserving the utility on benign ones. Experiments are conducted on the widely used WMDP benchmark across low- and high-entanglement configurations. Empirical results reveal that SRMU delivers state-of-the-art unlearning performance with minimal utility losses, and remains effective under 20-30\% overlap where existing baselines collapse. SRMU provides a robust foundation for safety-driven model governance, privacy compliance, and controlled knowledge removal in the emerging LLM-based applications. We release the replication package at https://figshare.com/s/d5931192a8824de26aff.

Abstract: Early prediction of battery cycle life is essential for accelerating battery research, manufacturing, and deployment. Although machine learning methods have shown encouraging results, progress is hindered by data scarcity and heterogeneity arising from diverse aging conditions. In other fields, foundation models (FMs) trained on diverse datasets have achieved broad generalization through transfer learning, but no FMs have been reported for battery cycle life prediction yet. Here we present the Pretrained Battery Transformer (PBT), the first FM for battery life prediction, developed through domain-knowledge-encoded mixture-of-expert layers. Validated on the largest public battery life database, PBT learns transferable representations from 13 lithium-ion battery (LIB) datasets, outperforming existing models by an average of 19.8%. With transfer learning, PBT achieves state-of-the-art performance across 15 diverse datasets encompassing various operating conditions, formation protocols, and chemistries of LIBs.

Abstract: Quantifying predictive uncertainty is essential for safe and trustworthy real-world AI deployment. Yet, fully nonparametric estimation of conditional distributions remains challenging for multivariate targets. We propose Tomographic Quantile Forests (TQF), a nonparametric, uncertainty-aware, tree-based regression model for multivariate targets. TQF learns conditional quantiles of directional projections $\mathbf{n}^{\top}\mathbf{y}$ as functions of the input $\mathbf{x}$ and the unit direction $\mathbf{n}$. At inference, it aggregates quantiles across many directions and reconstructs the multivariate conditional distribution by minimizing the sliced Wasserstein distance via an efficient alternating scheme with convex subproblems. Unlike classical directional-quantile approaches that typically produce only convex quantile regions and require training separate models for different directions, TQF covers all directions with a single model without imposing convexity restrictions. We evaluate TQF on synthetic and real-world datasets, and release the source code on GitHub.

Abstract: This work focuses on quantitative verification of fairness in tree ensembles. Unlike traditional verification approaches that merely return a single counterexample when the fairness is violated, quantitative verification estimates the ratio of all counterexamples and characterizes the regions where they occur, which is important information for diagnosing and mitigating bias. To date, quantitative verification has been explored almost exclusively for deep neural networks (DNNs). Representative methods, such as DeepGemini and FairQuant, all build on the core idea of Counterexample-Guided Abstraction Refinement, a generic framework that could be adapted to other model classes. We extended the framework into a model-agnostic form, but discovered two limitations: (i) it can provide only lower bounds, and (ii) its performance scales poorly. Exploiting the discrete structure of tree ensembles, our work proposes an efficient quantification technique that delivers any-time upper and lower bounds. Experiments on five widely used datasets demonstrate its effectiveness and efficiency. When applied to fairness testing, our quantification method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art testing techniques.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究面临两个主要问题：1) 水氮组合优化复杂度高且产量优化效果差；2) 轻度胁迫信号难以量化且反馈延迟，导致水氮动态调控不精准和资源利用效率低

Method: 提出嵌套双智能体强化学习(NDRL)方法：父智能体基于预期累积产量收益识别宏观灌溉施肥动作，减少无效探索；子智能体奖励函数包含量化的水分胁迫因子(WSF)和氮素胁迫因子(NSF)，使用混合概率分布动态优化每日策略

Result: 与最佳基线相比，模拟产量在2023和2024年均增加4.7%，灌溉水生产力分别提高5.6%和5.1%，氮素偏生产力分别提高6.3%和1.0%

Conclusion: NDRL方法推动了棉花灌溉和氮肥管理的发展，为解决农业资源管理的复杂性和精准性问题以及可持续农业发展提供了新思路

Abstract: Effective irrigation and nitrogen fertilization have a significant impact on crop yield. However, existing research faces two limitations: (1) the high complexity of optimizing water-nitrogen combinations during crop growth and poor yield optimization results; and (2) the difficulty in quantifying mild stress signals and the delayed feedback, which results in less precise dynamic regulation of water and nitrogen and lower resource utilization efficiency. To address these issues, we propose a Nested Dual-Agent Reinforcement Learning (NDRL) method. The parent agent in NDRL identifies promising macroscopic irrigation and fertilization actions based on projected cumulative yield benefits, reducing ineffective explorationwhile maintaining alignment between objectives and yield. The child agent's reward function incorporates quantified Water Stress Factor (WSF) and Nitrogen Stress Factor (NSF), and uses a mixed probability distribution to dynamically optimize daily strategies, thereby enhancing both yield and resource efficiency. We used field experiment data from 2023 and 2024 to calibrate and validate the Decision Support System for Agrotechnology Transfer (DSSAT) to simulate real-world conditions and interact with NDRL. Experimental results demonstrate that, compared to the best baseline, the simulated yield increased by 4.7% in both 2023 and 2024, the irrigation water productivity increased by 5.6% and 5.1% respectively, and the nitrogen partial factor productivity increased by 6.3% and 1.0% respectively. Our method advances the development of cotton irrigation and nitrogen fertilization, providing new ideas for addressing the complexity and precision issues in agricultural resource management and for sustainable agricultural development.

Abstract: Neural operators have emerged as powerful tools for learning mappings between function spaces, enabling efficient solutions to partial differential equations across varying inputs and domains. Despite the success, existing methods often struggle with non-periodic excitations, transient responses, and signals defined on irregular or non-Euclidean geometries. To address this, we propose a generalized operator learning framework based on a pole-residue decomposition enriched with exponential basis functions, enabling expressive modeling of aperiodic and decaying dynamics. Building on this formulation, we introduce the Geometric Laplace Neural Operator (GLNO), which embeds the Laplace spectral representation into the eigen-basis of the Laplace-Beltrami operator, extending operator learning to arbitrary Riemannian manifolds without requiring periodicity or uniform grids. We further design a grid-invariant network architecture (GLNONet) that realizes GLNO in practice. Extensive experiments on PDEs/ODEs and real-world datasets demonstrate our robust performance over other state-of-the-art models.

TL;DR: 提出一种多保真度延迟接受方案用于贝叶斯反问题，通过多保真度神经网络结合不同保真度的求解器预测，避免在线阶段的高保真度模拟，显著降低计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统贝叶斯反问题中的参数估计等任务计算成本高昂，特别是涉及偏微分方程时，有限元等全阶模型使得MCMC采样方法计算不可行。虽然数据驱动的代理模型可以减少评估成本，但生成高保真度数据本身就很昂贵。低保真度数据生成效率高，但单独使用会降低反问题求解精度。

Method: 提出多保真度延迟接受方案，扩展多级延迟接受框架。方法引入多保真度神经网络，结合不同保真度求解器的预测，高保真度评估仅限于离线训练阶段。在线阶段，通过评估粗求解器并将其输出传递给训练好的神经网络来获得似然评估，避免额外的高保真度模拟。该构造允许在层次结构中一致地整合异构粗求解器。

Result: 该方法提高了低保真度求解器的近似精度，导致更长的子链长度、更好的混合性和加速的后验推断。在两个基准反问题上展示了有效性：(i)稳态各向同性地下水流，(ii)非稳态反应扩散系统，获得了显著的计算节省。

Conclusion: 提出的多保真度延迟接受方案为贝叶斯反问题提供了一种灵活高效的计算框架，通过结合不同保真度的求解器和神经网络，在保持精度的同时大幅降低计算成本，特别适用于涉及偏微分方程的复杂物理模型。

Abstract: Inverse uncertainty quantification (UQ) tasks such as parameter estimation are computationally demanding whenever dealing with physics-based models, and typically require repeated evaluations of complex numerical solvers. When partial differential equations are involved, full-order models such as those based on the Finite Element Method can make traditional sampling approaches like Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) computationally infeasible. Although data-driven surrogate models may help reduce evaluation costs, their utility is often limited by the expense of generating high-fidelity data. In contrast, low-fidelity data can be produced more efficiently, although relying on them alone may degrade the accuracy of the inverse UQ solution.
  To address these challenges, we propose a Multi-Fidelity Delayed Acceptance scheme for Bayesian inverse problems. Extending the Multi-Level Delayed Acceptance framework, the method introduces multi-fidelity neural networks that combine the predictions of solvers of varying fidelity, with high fidelity evaluations restricted to an offline training stage. During the online phase, likelihood evaluations are obtained by evaluating the coarse solvers and passing their outputs to the trained neural networks, thereby avoiding additional high-fidelity simulations.
  This construction allows heterogeneous coarse solvers to be incorporated consistently within the hierarchy, providing greater flexibility than standard Multi-Level Delayed Acceptance. The proposed approach improves the approximation accuracy of the low fidelity solvers, leading to longer sub-chain lengths, better mixing, and accelerated posterior inference. The effectiveness of the strategy is demonstrated on two benchmark inverse problems involving (i) steady isotropic groundwater flow, (ii) an unsteady reaction-diffusion system, for which substantial computational savings are obtained.

Motivation: 多智能体系统虽然能通过协作决策提升预测任务性能，但缺乏有效的评估方法使得难以估计偏见风险，这在消费者金融等高风险领域尤其危险，因为偏见决策可能导致监管违规和财务损失。

Method: 开发多智能体预测系统的公平性评估方法，在金融表格数据领域使用大规模模拟，考察不同多智能体配置（包括不同的通信和协作机制）下的公平性指标。

Result: 研究发现金融决策中出现了无法追溯到单个智能体组件的涌现性偏见模式，表明多智能体系统可能表现出真正的集体行为。公平性风险在金融多智能体系统中是模型风险的重要组成部分，对信用评分和收入估计等任务有实际影响。

Conclusion: 多智能体决策系统必须作为整体实体进行评估，而不是通过对其组成组件的还原主义分析。公平性风险代表了模型风险的重要部分，需要系统性的评估方法。

Abstract: Multi-agent systems have demonstrated the ability to improve performance on a variety of predictive tasks by leveraging collaborative decision making. However, the lack of effective evaluation methodologies has made it difficult to estimate the risk of bias, making deployment of such systems unsafe in high stakes domains such as consumer finance, where biased decisions can translate directly into regulatory breaches and financial loss. To address this challenge, we need to develop fairness evaluation methodologies for multi-agent predictive systems and measure the fairness characteristics of these systems in the financial tabular domain. Examining fairness metrics using large-scale simulations across diverse multi-agent configurations, with varying communication and collaboration mechanisms, we reveal patterns of emergent bias in financial decision-making that cannot be traced to individual agent components, indicating that multi-agent systems may exhibit genuinely collective behaviors. Our findings highlight that fairness risks in financial multi-agent systems represent a significant component of model risk, with tangible impacts on tasks such as credit scoring and income estimation. We advocate that multi-agent decision systems must be evaluated as holistic entities rather than through reductionist analyses of their constituent components.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel methodology for detecting faults in wind turbine blades using com-putational learning techniques. The study evaluates two models: the first employs logistic regression, which outperformed neural networks, decision trees, and the naive Bayes method, demonstrating its effectiveness in identifying fault-related patterns. The second model leverages clustering and achieves superior performance in terms of precision and data segmentation. The results indicate that clustering may better capture the underlying data characteristics compared to supervised methods. The proposed methodology offers a new approach to early fault detection in wind turbine blades, highlighting the potential of integrating different computational learning techniques to enhance system reliability. The use of accessible tools like Orange Data Mining underscores the practical application of these advanced solutions within the wind energy sector. Future work will focus on combining these methods to improve detection accuracy further and extend the application of these techniques to other critical components in energy infrastructure.

TL;DR: 该研究将LDA主题模型的主题数量选择问题转化为离散黑盒优化问题，比较了四种优化方法在验证困惑度指标上的表现，发现摊销优化方法在样本和时间效率上显著优于传统进化算法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LDA主题模型中主题数量T的选择是一个关键设计决策，它直接影响模型的统计拟合度和可解释性。传统方法通常依赖经验规则或网格搜索，缺乏系统化的优化方法。

Method: 将主题数量选择问题形式化为离散黑盒优化问题，其中每次函数评估对应训练一个LDA模型并计算其验证困惑度。在固定评估预算下，比较了四种优化器：两种手工设计的进化方法（遗传算法GA和进化策略ES），以及两种学习的摊销方法（优先摊销黑盒优化PABBO和锐度感知黑盒优化SABBO）。

Result: 实验表明，虽然四种方法最终都能达到相似的困惑度水平，但摊销优化方法在样本和时间效率上显著更优。SABBO通常在一次评估后就能识别出接近最优的主题数量，PABBO在几次评估内就能找到有竞争力的配置，而GA和ES需要几乎用尽全部预算才能达到相同区域。

Conclusion: 摊销黑盒优化方法在LDA主题数量选择问题上表现出卓越的效率优势，特别是SABBO和PABBO能够以极少的评估次数找到高质量的解，这为模型超参数优化提供了更高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Choosing the number of topics $T$ in Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) is a key design decision that strongly affects both the statistical fit and interpretability of topic models. In this work, we formulate the selection of $T$ as a discrete black-box optimization problem, where each function evaluation corresponds to training an LDA model and measuring its validation perplexity. Under a fixed evaluation budget, we compare four families of optimizers: two hand-designed evolutionary methods - Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Evolution Strategy (ES) - and two learned, amortized approaches, Preferential Amortized Black-Box Optimization (PABBO) and Sharpness-Aware Black-Box Optimization (SABBO). Our experiments show that, while GA, ES, PABBO, and SABBO eventually reach a similar band of final perplexity, the amortized optimizers are substantially more sample- and time-efficient. SABBO typically identifies a near-optimal topic number after essentially a single evaluation, and PABBO finds competitive configurations within a few evaluations, whereas GA and ES require almost the full budget to approach the same region.

Abstract: The Internet of Things (IoT) is a concept by which objects find identity and can communicate with each other in a network. One of the applications of the IoT is in the field of medicine, which is called the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT). Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia (ALL) is a type of cancer categorized as a hematic disease. It usually begins in the bone marrow due to the overproduction of immature White Blood Cells (WBCs or leukocytes). Since it has a high rate of spread to other body organs, it is a fatal disease if not diagnosed and treated early. Therefore, for identifying cancerous (ALL) cells in medical diagnostic laboratories, blood, as well as bone marrow smears, are taken by pathologists. However, manual examinations face limitations due to human error risk and time-consuming procedures. So, to tackle the mentioned issues, methods based on Artificial Intelligence (AI), capable of identifying cancer from non-cancer tissue, seem vital. Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are the most efficient machine learning (ML) methods. These techniques employ multiple layers to extract higher-level features from the raw input. In this paper, a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is applied along with a new type of classifier, Higher Order Singular Value Decomposition (HOSVD), to categorize ALL and normal (healthy) cells from microscopic blood images. We employed the model on IoMT structure to identify leukemia quickly and safely. With the help of this new leukemia classification framework, patients and clinicians can have real-time communication. The model was implemented on the Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia Image Database (ALL-IDB2) and achieved an average accuracy of %98.88 in the test step.

Conclusion: 该方法可直接集成到标准量化工作流中，为边缘和嵌入式设备等资源受限场景提供端到端的整数推理能力。

Abstract: Quantised neural networks (QNNs) shrink models and reduce inference energy through low-bit arithmetic, yet most still depend on a running statistics batch normalisation (BN) layer, preventing true integer-only deployment. Prior attempts remove BN by parameter folding or tailored initialisation; while helpful, they rarely recover BN's stability and accuracy and often impose bespoke constraints. We present a BN-free, fully integer QNN trained via a progressive, layer-wise distillation scheme that slots into existing low-bit pipelines. Starting from a pretrained BN-enabled teacher, we use layer-wise targets and progressive compensation to train a student that performs inference exclusively with integer arithmetic and contains no BN operations. On ImageNet with AlexNet, the BN-free model attains competitive Top-1 accuracy under aggressive quantisation. The procedure integrates directly with standard quantisation workflows, enabling end-to-end integer-only inference for resource-constrained settings such as edge and embedded devices.

Conclusion: PLSCAN是一种无需参数选择的密度聚类算法，能够自动发现稳定的聚类结构，在探索性数据分析中具有实用价值。

Abstract: Clustering is a cornerstone of modern data analysis. Detecting clusters in exploratory data analyses (EDA) requires algorithms that make few assumptions about the data. Density-based clustering algorithms are particularly well-suited for EDA because they describe high-density regions, assuming only that a density exists. Applying density-based clustering algorithms in practice, however, requires selecting appropriate hyperparameters, which is difficult without prior knowledge of the data distribution. For example, DBSCAN requires selecting a density threshold, and HDBSCAN* relies on a minimum cluster size parameter. In this work, we propose Persistent Leaves Spatial Clustering for Applications with Noise (PLSCAN). This novel density-based clustering algorithm efficiently identifies all minimum cluster sizes for which HDBSCAN* produces stable (leaf) clusters. PLSCAN applies scale-space clustering principles and is equivalent to persistent homology on a novel metric space. We compare its performance to HDBSCAN* on several real-world datasets, demonstrating that it achieves a higher average ARI and is less sensitive to changes in the number of mutual reachability neighbours. Additionally, we compare PLSCAN's computational costs to k-Means, demonstrating competitive run-times on low-dimensional datasets. At higher dimensions, run times scale more similarly to HDBSCAN*.

Motivation: 展示广告系统中用户购买行为建模面临两大挑战：正样本稀疏性和用户行为随机性导致严重的类别不平衡和事件时间不规则。现有方法要么依赖手工"计数"特征忽略用户意图的细粒度时间演化，要么只提取直接序列信号而忽略有用的事件计数统计。

Method: 提出Abacus方法，通过自监督预训练预测用户事件的频率分布。进一步提出混合目标函数，将Abacus与序列学习目标统一，结合聚合统计的稳定性和序列建模的敏感性。

Conclusion: Abacus方法有效解决了展示广告中用户行为建模的挑战，通过自监督预训练预测事件频率分布，结合序列建模，显著提升了预测性能。

Abstract: Modeling user purchase behavior is a critical challenge in display advertising systems, necessary for real-time bidding. The difficulty arises from the sparsity of positive user events and the stochasticity of user actions, leading to severe class imbalance and irregular event timing. Predictive systems usually rely on hand-crafted "counter" features, overlooking the fine-grained temporal evolution of user intent. Meanwhile, current sequential models extract direct sequential signal, missing useful event-counting statistics. We enhance deep sequential models with self-supervised pretraining strategies for display advertising. Especially, we introduce Abacus, a novel approach of predicting the empirical frequency distribution of user events. We further propose a hybrid objective unifying Abacus with sequential learning objectives, combining stability of aggregated statistics with the sequence modeling sensitivity. Experiments on two real-world datasets show that Abacus pretraining outperforms existing methods accelerating downstream task convergence, while hybrid approach yields up to +6.1% AUC compared to the baselines.

Motivation: 现有偏好优化方法如RLHF（基于标量奖励）和NLHF（基于同时博弈均衡）在捕获复杂偏好结构方面存在局限，需要一种能更好处理序贯决策和推理时精炼的框架。

Method: 将偏好优化建模为序贯博弈：领导者策略承诺行动，跟随者策略根据领导者行动条件响应。将问题分解为跟随者的精炼问题和领导者对抗对手的优化问题。

Conclusion: SLHF框架在一致性、数据敏感性和处理非传递偏好鲁棒性方面具有优势，为偏好优化提供了新的序贯博弈视角，支持推理时精炼能力。

Abstract: We introduce Stackelberg Learning from Human Feedback (SLHF), a new framework for preference optimization. SLHF frames the alignment problem as a sequential-move game between two policies: a Leader, which commits to an action, and a Follower, which responds conditionally on the Leader's action. This approach decomposes preference optimization into a refinement problem for the Follower and an optimization problem against an adversary for the Leader. Unlike Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), which assigns scalar rewards to actions, or Nash Learning from Human Feedback (NLHF), which seeks a simultaneous-move equilibrium, SLHF leverages the asymmetry of sequential play to capture richer preference structures. The sequential design of SLHF naturally enables inference-time refinement, as the Follower learns to improve the Leader's actions, and these refinements can be leveraged through iterative sampling. We compare the solution concepts of SLHF, RLHF, and NLHF, and lay out key advantages in consistency, data sensitivity, and robustness to intransitive preferences. Experiments on large language models demonstrate that SLHF achieves strong alignment across diverse preference datasets, scales from 0.5B to 8B parameters, and yields inference-time refinements that transfer across model families without further fine-tuning.

Motivation: 边缘计算中基于深度学习的射频指纹识别模型在实际部署时面临关键挑战：当应用于具有不同硬件特性的接收器时，由于接收器变化引入的分布偏移，模型性能会显著下降。现有方法需要源域数据，但实际场景中源数据可能不可用。

Abstract: With the rapid proliferation of edge computing, Radio Frequency Fingerprint Identification (RFFI) has become increasingly important for secure device authentication. However, practical deployment of deep learning-based RFFI models is hindered by a critical challenge: their performance often degrades significantly when applied across receivers with different hardware characteristics due to distribution shifts introduced by receiver variation. To address this, we investigate the source-data-free cross-receiver RFFI (SCRFFI) problem, where a model pretrained on labeled signals from a source receiver must adapt to unlabeled signals from a target receiver, without access to any source-domain data during adaptation. We first formulate a novel constrained pseudo-labeling-based SCRFFI adaptation framework, and provide a theoretical analysis of its generalization performance. Our analysis highlights a key insight: the target-domain performance is highly sensitive to the quality of the pseudo-labels generated during adaptation. Motivated by this, we propose Momentum Soft pseudo-label Source Hypothesis Transfer (MS-SHOT), a new method for SCRFFI that incorporates momentum-center-guided soft pseudo-labeling and enforces global structural constraints to encourage confident and diverse predictions. Notably, MS-SHOT effectively addresses scenarios involving label shift or unknown, non-uniform class distributions in the target domain -- a significant limitation of prior methods. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that MS-SHOT consistently outperforms existing approaches in both accuracy and robustness, offering a practical and scalable solution for source-data-free cross-receiver adaptation in RFFI.

TL;DR: DataFlow是一个统一的LLM驱动数据准备框架，提供模块化、可组合的数据转换抽象和PyTorch风格API，包含近200个可重用操作符和六个领域通用管道，通过DataFlow-Agent实现自然语言到可执行管道的自动转换，在多个基准测试中显著提升LLM性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM数据准备实践主要依赖临时脚本和松散定义的工作流，缺乏原则性抽象、可复现性差，且对模型在环数据生成支持有限，无法满足高质量数据快速增长的需求。

Method: 提出DataFlow框架，采用系统级抽象实现模块化、可重用、可组合的数据转换，提供PyTorch风格管道构建API。包含近200个可重用操作符和六个领域通用管道（文本、数学推理、代码、Text-to-SQL、代理RAG、大规模知识提取）。引入DataFlow-Agent通过操作符合成、管道规划和迭代验证自动将自然语言规范转换为可执行管道。

Result: 在六个代表性用例中，DataFlow持续提升下游LLM性能：数学、代码和文本管道优于人工策划数据集和专用合成基线，Text-to-SQL执行准确率比SynSQL提高+3%，代码基准平均提升7%，MATH、GSM8K和AIME获得1-3分提升。统一的10K样本数据集使基础模型性能超过使用1M Infinity-Instruct数据训练的对应模型。

Conclusion: DataFlow为可靠、可复现、可扩展的LLM数据准备提供了实用高性能基础，建立了未来以数据为中心的AI开发的系统级基础。

Abstract: The rapidly growing demand for high-quality data in Large Language Models (LLMs) has intensified the need for scalable, reliable, and semantically rich data preparation pipelines. However, current practices remain dominated by ad-hoc scripts and loosely specified workflows, which lack principled abstractions, hinder reproducibility, and offer limited support for model-in-the-loop data generation. To address these challenges, we present DataFlow, a unified and extensible LLM-driven data preparation framework. DataFlow is designed with system-level abstractions that enable modular, reusable, and composable data transformations, and provides a PyTorch-style pipeline construction API for building debuggable and optimizable dataflows. The framework consists of nearly 200 reusable operators and six domain-general pipelines spanning text, mathematical reasoning, code, Text-to-SQL, agentic RAG, and large-scale knowledge extraction. To further improve usability, we introduce DataFlow-Agent, which automatically translates natural-language specifications into executable pipelines via operator synthesis, pipeline planning, and iterative verification. Across six representative use cases, DataFlow consistently improves downstream LLM performance. Our math, code, and text pipelines outperform curated human datasets and specialized synthetic baselines, achieving up to +3\% execution accuracy in Text-to-SQL over SynSQL, +7\% average improvements on code benchmarks, and 1--3 point gains on MATH, GSM8K, and AIME. Moreover, a unified 10K-sample dataset produced by DataFlow enables base models to surpass counterparts trained on 1M Infinity-Instruct data. These results demonstrate that DataFlow provides a practical and high-performance substrate for reliable, reproducible, and scalable LLM data preparation, and establishes a system-level foundation for future data-centric AI development.

Abstract: Text classification problems, such as gender classification from a blog, have been a well-matured research area that has been well studied using machine learning algorithms. It has several application domains in market analysis, customer recommendation, and recommendation systems. This study presents a comparative analysis of the widely used machine learning algorithms, namely Support Vector Machines (SVM), Naive Bayes (NB), Logistic Regression (LR), AdaBoost, XGBoost, and an SVM variant (SVM_R) with neuro-symbolic AI (NeSy). The paper also explores the effect of text representations such as TF-IDF, the Universal Sentence Encoder (USE), and RoBERTa.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CLARiTy是一个基于视觉Transformer的模型，用于胸部X光片的多标签分类和弱监督定位，通过类特定token和SegmentCAM模块实现精确的病理定位，在NIH ChestX-ray14数据集上取得了最先进的弱监督定位性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 胸部X光片解读面临多标签病理分类和空间定位的挑战，通常受限于区域级（密集）标注的稀缺性。需要一种能够同时处理不同标注粒度任务的解决方案。

Method: CLARiTy采用视觉Transformer架构，使用多个类特定token生成区分性注意力图，结合SegmentCAM模块进行前景分割和背景抑制（利用解剖先验知识）。使用ConvNeXtV2教师模型进行蒸馏训练，提高效率。

Result: 在NIH ChestX-ray14数据集上，CLARiTy-S-16-512在14种病理分类上取得竞争性性能，在8种病理的弱监督定位上达到最先进水平，比先前方法提升50.7%。特别是对小病理（如结节和肿块）有显著提升。低分辨率变体CLARiTy-S-16-224在保持高效率的同时也超越了基线方法。

Conclusion: CLARiTy超越了CNN-ViT混合方法，通过利用ViT自注意力获取全局上下文和类特定定位，并通过卷积背景抑制进行精炼，生成精确、降噪的热力图，在低资源环境下具有应用潜力。

Abstract: The interpretation of chest X-rays (CXRs) poses significant challenges, particularly in achieving accurate multi-label pathology classification and spatial localization. These tasks demand different levels of annotation granularity but are frequently constrained by the scarcity of region-level (dense) annotations. We introduce CLARiTy (Class Localizing and Attention Refining Image Transformer), a vision transformer-based model for joint multi-label classification and weakly-supervised localization of thoracic pathologies. CLARiTy employs multiple class-specific tokens to generate discriminative attention maps, and a SegmentCAM module for foreground segmentation and background suppression using explicit anatomical priors. Trained on image-level labels from the NIH ChestX-ray14 dataset, it leverages distillation from a ConvNeXtV2 teacher for efficiency. Evaluated on the official NIH split, the CLARiTy-S-16-512 (a configuration of CLARiTy), achieves competitive classification performance across 14 pathologies, and state-of-the-art weakly-supervised localization performance on 8 pathologies, outperforming prior methods by 50.7%. In particular, pronounced gains occur for small pathologies like nodules and masses. The lower-resolution variant of CLARiTy, CLARiTy-S-16-224, offers high efficiency while decisively surpassing baselines, thereby having the potential for use in low-resource settings. An ablation study confirms contributions of SegmentCAM, DINO pretraining, orthogonal class token loss, and attention pooling. CLARiTy advances beyond CNN-ViT hybrids by harnessing ViT self-attention for global context and class-specific localization, refined through convolutional background suppression for precise, noise-reduced heatmaps.

Abstract: In recent years, Predictive Process Mining (PPM) techniques based on artificial neural networks have evolved as a method for monitoring the future behavior of unfolding business processes and predicting Key Performance Indicators (KPIs). However, many PPM approaches often lack reproducibility, transparency in decision making, usability for incorporating novel datasets and benchmarking, making comparisons among different implementations very difficult. In this paper, we propose SPICE, a Python framework that reimplements three popular, existing baseline deep-learning-based methods for PPM in PyTorch, while designing a common base framework with rigorous configurability to enable reproducible and robust comparison of past and future modelling approaches. We compare SPICE to original reported metrics and with fair metrics on 11 datasets.

Abstract: In actuality, phishing attacks remain one of the most prevalent cybersecurity risks in existence today, with malevolent actors constantly changing their strategies to successfully trick users. This paper presents an AI model for a phishing detection system that uses an ensemble approach to combine character-level Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and LightGBM with engineered features. Our system uses a character-level CNN to extract sequential features after extracting 36 lexical, structural, and domain-based features from the URLs. On a test dataset of 19,873 URLs, the ensemble model achieves an accuracy of 99.819 percent, precision of 100 percent, recall of 99.635 percent, and ROC-AUC of 99.947 percent. Through a FastAPI-based service with an intuitive user interface, the suggested system has been utilised to offer real-time detection. In contrast, the results demonstrate that the suggested solution performs better than individual models; LightGBM contributes 40 percent and character-CNN contributes 60 percent to the final prediction. The suggested method maintains extremely low false positive rates while doing a good job of identifying contemporary phishing techniques.

Motivation: 之前的研究表明机器学习回归问题可以在随机函数理论框架下解决，最优核函数解析推导为多调和样条。但直接应用存在O(N^3)计算复杂度过高的问题，且当输入空间维度过高时原始理论假设失效。

Method: 提出级联架构，由多调和样条包构建，同时解决可扩展性问题，并为具有未知内在低维性的问题提供理论依据。提出了前向计算和端到端级联微分的高效矩阵程序。

Result: 级联架构能够同时解决计算可扩展性和高维输入空间问题，为具有未知内在低维性的回归问题提供了理论保证。

Conclusion: 提出的多调和样条包级联架构有效解决了先前方法在计算复杂度和高维输入空间方面的限制，为大规模回归问题提供了实用的解决方案。

Abstract: In a previous paper it was shown that a machine learning regression problem can be solved within the framework of random function theory, with the optimal kernel analytically derived from symmetry and indifference principles and coinciding with a polyharmonic spline. However, a direct application of that solution is limited by O(N^3) computational cost and by a breakdown of the original theoretical assumptions when the input space has excessive dimensionality. This paper proposes a cascade architecture built from packages of polyharmonic splines that simultaneously addresses scalability and is theoretically justified for problems with unknown intrinsic low dimensionality. Efficient matrix procedures are presented for forward computation and end-to-end differentiation through the cascade.

TL;DR: KOSS：基于卡尔曼最优选择的状态空间模型，通过将选择机制建模为潜在状态不确定性最小化，实现内容与上下文感知的闭环选择，在长序列建模任务中显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有选择性状态空间模型（如Mamba、Mamba-2）的选择机制缺乏理论依据，且无法支持基于潜在状态动态的上下文感知选择。需要建立理论支撑的选择机制，实现内容与上下文感知的动态信息传播。

Method: 提出KOSS模型，将选择机制形式化为潜在状态不确定性最小化问题，基于估计理论推导出由卡尔曼增益驱动的连续时间潜在状态更新。采用全局谱微分进行频域导数估计，结合分段扫描实现硬件高效处理。

Result: 在选择性复制任务中达到79%以上准确率（基线低于20%）；在9个长期预测基准上，MSE降低2.92-36.23%；在二次监视雷达跟踪案例中验证了在非规则间隔和噪声条件下的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: KOSS通过理论驱动的闭环选择机制实现了内容与上下文感知的动态信息传播，在序列建模任务中表现出优越的性能和稳定性，为选择性状态空间模型提供了理论支撑。

Abstract: Recent selective state space models (SSMs), such as Mamba and Mamba-2, have demonstrated strong performance in sequence modeling owing to input-dependent selection mechanisms. However, these mechanisms lack theoretical grounding and cannot support context-aware selection from latent state dynamics. To address these limitations, we propose KOSS, a Kalman-optimal Selective State Space model that formulates selection as latent state uncertainty minimization. Derived from estimation theory, KOSS adopts a continuous-time latent update driven by a Kalman gain that dynamically modulates information propagation based on content and context, enabling a closed-loop, context-aware selectivity mechanism. To ensure stable computation and near-linear scalability, KOSS employs global spectral differentiation for frequency-domain derivative estimation, along with a segment-wise scan for hardware-efficient processing. On a selective copying task with distractors, KOSS achieves over 79\% accuracy while baselines drop below 20\%, demonstrating robust context-aware selection. Furthermore, across nine long-term forecasting benchmarks, KOSS reduces MSE by 2.92--36.23\% and consistently outperforms state-of-the-art models in both accuracy and stability. To assess real-world applicability, a case study on secondary surveillance radar (SSR) tracking confirms KOSS's robustness under irregular intervals and noisy conditions and demonstrates its effectiveness in real-world applications. Finally, supplementary experiments verify Kalman gain convergence and the frequency response of spectral differentiation, providing theoretical support for the proposed closed-loop design.

Motivation: 印尼朝觐和副朝服务的快速数字化虽然便利了朝觐者，但也为通过虚假移动应用进行的数字欺诈开辟了途径。这些欺诈应用不仅造成经济损失，还通过收集敏感个人数据带来严重的隐私风险。本研究旨在解决这一关键问题。

Method: 使用包含官方注册应用和非官方应用的综合数据集，比较三种分类器：支持向量机(SVM)、随机森林(RF)和朴素贝叶斯(NB)。采用混合特征提取方法，结合应用描述的文本分析(TF-IDF)和敏感访问权限的元数据分析。

Abstract: The rapid digitalization of Hajj and Umrah services in Indonesia has significantly facilitated pilgrims but has concurrently opened avenues for digital fraud through counterfeit mobile applications. These fraudulent applications not only inflict financial losses but also pose severe privacy risks by harvesting sensitive personal data. This research aims to address this critical issue by implementing and evaluating machine learning algorithms to verify application authenticity automatically. Using a comprehensive dataset comprising both official applications registered with the Ministry of Religious Affairs and unofficial applications circulating on app stores, we compare the performance of three robust classifiers: Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF), and Na"ive Bayes (NB). The study utilizes a hybrid feature extraction methodology that combines Textual Analysis (TF-IDF) of application descriptions with Metadata Analysis of sensitive access permissions. The experimental results indicate that the SVM algorithm achieves the highest performance with an accuracy of 92.3%, a precision of 91.5%, and an F1-score of 92.0%. Detailed feature analysis reveals that specific keywords related to legality and high-risk permissions (e.g., READ PHONE STATE) are the most significant discriminators. This system is proposed as a proactive, scalable solution to enhance digital trust in the religious tourism sector, potentially serving as a prototype for a national verification system.

Motivation: GPT架构是当前最流行的语言建模设计，而能量基模型（EBM）将推理视为在能量景观上的动态过程。本文旨在通过最小修改将GPT与EBM框架统一起来，结合两者的优势。

Method: 提出eNeRgy-GPT（NRGPT）模型，将GPT设置与EBM框架统一。模型的推理步骤被概念化为在能量景观上对token的探索，在某些情况下这种探索会退化为梯度下降，但不一定产生最佳性能模型。

Result: 模型在简单语言（Shakespeare数据集）、代数ListOPS任务以及更丰富的OpenWebText语言建模任务上表现良好。同时观察到模型具有更强的抗过拟合能力，只在非常长的训练过程中才会出现过拟合。

Conclusion: 成功将GPT架构与能量基模型框架统一，提出的NRGPT模型在多个任务上表现优异，并展现出更好的泛化能力和抗过拟合特性，为语言建模提供了新的视角和方法。

Abstract: Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) architectures are the most popular design for language modeling. Energy-based modeling is a different paradigm that views inference as a dynamical process operating on an energy landscape. We propose a minimal modification of the GPT setting to unify it with the EBM framework. The inference step of our model, which we call eNeRgy-GPT (NRGPT), is conceptualized as an exploration of the tokens on the energy landscape. We prove, and verify empirically, that under certain circumstances this exploration becomes gradient descent, although they don't necessarily lead to the best performing models. We demonstrate that our model performs well for simple language (Shakespeare dataset), algebraic ListOPS tasks, and richer settings such as OpenWebText language modeling. We also observe that our models may be more resistant to overfitting, doing so only during very long training.

Motivation: 复杂系统（如大脑、细胞、气候、经济等）具有高维非线性动力学特性，传统建模方法难以处理。虽然信息技术带来了数据驱动方法，但时空数据的庞大和复杂性阻碍了传统降维、相空间重构和吸引子表征技术的应用。

Conclusion: 该框架为理解复杂动力系统提供了稳健途径，特别适用于传统建模不切实际但实验数据丰富的场景，为复杂系统分析提供了新的几何工具。

Abstract: A complex system comprises multiple interacting entities whose interdependencies form a unified whole, exhibiting emergent behaviours not present in individual components. Examples include the human brain, living cells, soft matter, Earth's climate, ecosystems, and the economy. These systems exhibit high-dimensional, non-linear dynamics, making their modelling, classification, and prediction particularly challenging. Advances in information technology have enabled data-driven approaches to studying such systems. However, the sheer volume and complexity of spatio-temporal data often hinder traditional methods like dimensionality reduction, phase-space reconstruction, and attractor characterisation. This paper introduces a geometric framework for analysing spatio-temporal data from complex systems, grounded in the theory of vector fields over discrete measure spaces. We propose a two-parameter family of metrics suitable for data analysis and machine learning applications. The framework supports time-dependent images, image gradients, and real- or vector-valued functions defined on graphs and simplicial complexes. We validate our approach using data from numerical simulations of biological and physical systems on flat and curved domains. Our results show that the proposed metrics, combined with multidimensional scaling, effectively address key analytical challenges. They enable dimensionality reduction, mode decomposition, phase-space reconstruction, and attractor characterisation. Our findings offer a robust pathway for understanding complex dynamical systems, especially in contexts where traditional modelling is impractical but abundant experimental data are available.

TL;DR: MEPIC是一个内存高效的KV缓存系统，通过分页对齐、块级重计算和RoPE融合等技术，实现跨位置、请求和批次的块级KV重用，显著减少HBM内存使用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代LLM应用（如深度研究助手、编码代理和RAG系统）需要反复处理包含共享文档或代码块的长提示历史，这给KV缓存带来巨大压力。现有的前缀缓存和位置无关缓存方法存在限制，导致即使许多请求重用相同内容，HBM内存节省也有限。

Method: 1. 将块KV对齐到分页存储；2. 将重计算从token级转移到块级，只有第一个块是请求特定的；3. 通过注意力内核中的RoPE融合移除位置编码；4. 使剩余块完全可共享。

Result: MEPIC在保持相当延迟和准确性的情况下，相比最先进的PIC技术，将HBM使用减少高达2倍；对于长提示，减少高达5倍，且无需任何模型更改。

Conclusion: MEPIC通过创新的内存优化技术，有效解决了LLM应用中KV缓存的内存效率问题，实现了跨位置、请求和批次的块级重用，显著提升了内存利用率。

Abstract: Modern LLM applications such as deep-research assistants, coding agents, and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems, repeatedly process long prompt histories containing shared document or code chunks, creating significant pressure on the Key Value (KV) cache, which must operate within limited memory while sustaining high throughput and low latency. Prefix caching partially alleviates some of these costs by reusing KV cache for previously processed tokens, but limited by strict prefix matching. Position-independent caching (PIC) enables chunk-level reuse at arbitrary positions, but requires selective recomputation and positional-encoding (PE) adjustments. However, because these operations vary across queries, KV for the same chunk diverges across requests. Moreover, without page alignment, chunk KV layouts diverge in memory, preventing page sharing. These issues result in only modest HBM savings even when many requests reuse the same content.
  We present MEPIC, a memory-efficient PIC system that enables chunk KV reuse across positions, requests, and batches. MEPIC aligns chunk KV to paged storage, shifts recomputation from token- to block-level so only the first block is request-specific, removes positional encodings via Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) fusion in the attention kernel, and makes remaining blocks fully shareable. These techniques eliminate most duplicate chunk KV in HBM, reducing usage by up to 2x over state-of-the-art PIC at comparable latency and accuracy, and up to 5x for long prompts, without any model changes.

TL;DR: TRC是一种基于递归迭代的神经控制架构，通过深度迭代而非参数数量来提升控制能力，在保持小参数规模（约1.5M）的同时实现接近最优的控制性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统神经网络控制器需要数百万甚至数十亿参数，这对于有严格功耗和延迟限制的嵌入式航空航天系统来说是不可行的。需要一种既能保持小参数规模又能实现高性能控制的方法。

Method: 提出Tiny Recursive Control (TRC)架构，基于"能力可以从迭代深度而非参数数量中涌现"的原则。使用紧凑网络（约1.5M参数）通过两级分层潜在结构重复应用，通过模拟轨迹和基于跟踪误差校正来细化控制序列。相同权重处理每个细化步骤，增加迭代只增加计算而不增加内存。

Result: 在非线性控制问题（包括振荡器稳定和带燃料约束的动力下降）上评估TRC。在所有领域都实现了接近最优的控制成本，在GPU上仅需毫秒级推理时间，内存使用低于10MB，比语言模型基线小两个数量级。

Conclusion: 递归推理（之前仅限于离散任务）可以有效地转移到连续控制合成中，为嵌入式系统提供了一种参数效率高、计算轻量的控制解决方案。

Abstract: Neural network controllers increasingly demand millions of parameters, and language model approaches push into the billions. For embedded aerospace systems with strict power and latency constraints, this scaling is prohibitive. We present Tiny Recursive Control (TRC), a neural architecture based on a counterintuitive principle: capacity can emerge from iteration depth rather than parameter count. TRC applies compact networks (approximately 1.5M parameters) repeatedly through a two-level hierarchical latent structure, refining control sequences by simulating trajectories and correcting based on tracking error. Because the same weights process every refinement step, adding iterations increases computation without increasing memory. We evaluate TRC on nonlinear control problems including oscillator stabilization and powered descent with fuel constraints. Across these domains, TRC achieves near-optimal control costs while requiring only millisecond-scale inference on GPU and under 10~MB memory, two orders of magnitude smaller than language model baselines. These results demonstrate that recursive reasoning, previously confined to discrete tasks, transfers effectively to continuous control synthesis.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RL训练的LLM智能体在需要主动探索的任务中表现不佳，难以从试错经验中高效适应。需要一种方法让智能体在测试时能主动探索环境并学习反馈。

Method: LaMer包含两个关键组件：1)跨回合训练框架，鼓励探索和长期奖励优化；2)通过反思进行上下文策略适应，让智能体从任务反馈信号中适应策略而无需梯度更新。

Result: 在Sokoban、MineSweeper和Webshop等多样化环境中，LaMer相比RL基线分别获得11%、14%和19%的性能提升，并且在更具挑战性或未见任务上表现出更好的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 元强化学习为语言智能体提供了诱导探索的原则性方法，通过学习探索策略实现对新颖环境更鲁棒的适应。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has enabled the training of large language model (LLM) agents to interact with the environment and to solve multi-turn long-horizon tasks. However, the RL-trained agents often struggle in tasks that require active exploration and fail to efficiently adapt from trial-and-error experiences. In this paper, we present LaMer, a general Meta-RL framework that enables LLM agents to actively explore and learn from the environment feedback at test time. LaMer consists of two key components: (i) a cross-episode training framework to encourage exploration and long-term rewards optimization; and (ii) in-context policy adaptation via reflection, allowing the agent to adapt their policy from task feedback signal without gradient update. Experiments across diverse environments show that LaMer significantly improves performance over RL baselines, with 11%, 14%, and 19% performance gains on Sokoban, MineSweeper and Webshop, respectively. Moreover, LaMer also demonstrates better generalization to more challenging or previously unseen tasks compared to the RL-trained agents. Overall, our results demonstrate that Meta-RL provides a principled approach to induce exploration in language agents, enabling more robust adaptation to novel environments through learned exploration strategies.

TL;DR: 本文提出知识转换（KT）方法，结合知识蒸馏、主动学习和因果推理，为在线边缘机器学习中未见数据生成伪标签，解决边缘设备持续学习中的标注难题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有边缘机器学习方法通常假设静态模型在中心训练后部署，无法有效处理未见数据。在线边缘机器学习允许模型直接在边缘设备上训练并持续更新，但面临如何为未来未见数据确定标签的关键挑战。

Method: 提出知识转换（KT）混合方法，结合知识蒸馏、主动学习和因果推理。KT在主动学习中充当预言机，将教师模型的知识转换为学生模型的伪标签，实现持续学习。

Result: 通过两种设置的模拟实验验证：1）使用不太稳定的教师模型；2）使用相对更稳定的教师模型。结果表明，当提供稳定的教师模型时，学生模型最终能达到预期最大性能。

Conclusion: KT方法在以下场景具有潜在优势：1）教师任务通用，现有预训练模型足以完成任务，无需从头训练教师模型；2）学生任务的标签难以获取或成本高昂。

Abstract: Edge machine learning (Edge ML) enables training ML models using the vast data distributed across network edges. However, many existing approaches assume static models trained centrally and then deployed, making them ineffective against unseen data. To address this, Online Edge ML allows models to be trained directly on edge devices and updated continuously with new data. This paper explores a key challenge of Online Edge ML: "How to determine labels for truly future, unseen data points". We propose Knowledge Transformation (KT), a hybrid method combining Knowledge Distillation, Active Learning, and causal reasoning. In short, KT acts as the oracle in active learning by transforming knowledge from a teacher model to generate pseudo-labels for training a student model. To verify the validity of the method, we conducted simulation experiments with two setups: (1) using a less stable teacher model and (2) a relatively more stable teacher model. Results indicate that when a stable teacher model is given, the student model can eventually reach its expected maximum performance. KT is potentially beneficial for scenarios that meet the following circumstances: (1) when the teacher's task is generic, which means existing pre-trained models might be adequate for its task, so there will be no need to train the teacher model from scratch; and/or (2) when the label for the student's task is difficult or expensive to acquire.

TL;DR: 本文提出通过智能任务排序来缓解持续学习中的灾难性遗忘问题，利用零样本评分算法确定最优任务顺序，并与传统方法结合提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 持续学习系统需要在整个生命周期中增量获取、更新和利用知识，但灾难性遗忘（学习新任务导致旧任务性能急剧下降）是主要挑战。现有方法大多关注模型内部机制，本文从任务排序角度探索缓解遗忘的新途径。

Method: 提出基于零样本评分算法的任务排序方法，灵感来自神经架构搜索（NAS）。通过智能确定任务呈现顺序来优化学习过程，并与传统持续学习方法（如基于回放、正则化、优化、表示和架构的方法）结合使用。

Result: 实验结果表明，智能任务排序能显著减少灾难性遗忘。当与传统持续学习策略结合时，能提供更好的性能和更强的抗遗忘鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 任务排序是缓解持续学习中灾难性遗忘的有效策略，为传统方法提供了有价值的补充。该方法还可应用于课程学习等其他领域，展示了任务顺序优化在机器学习中的广泛适用性。

Abstract: To cope with real-world dynamics, an intelligent system needs to incrementally acquire, update, and exploit knowledge throughout its lifetime. This ability, known as Continual learning, provides a foundation for AI systems to develop themselves adaptively. Catastrophic forgetting is a major challenge to the progress of Continual Learning approaches, where learning a new task usually results in a dramatic performance drop on previously learned ones. Many approaches have emerged to counteract the impact of CF. Most of the proposed approaches can be categorized into five classes: replay-based, regularization-based, optimization-based, representation-based, and architecture-based. In this work, we approach the problem from a different angle, specifically by considering the optimal sequencing of tasks as they are presented to the model. We investigate the role of task sequencing in mitigating CF and propose a method for determining the optimal task order. The proposed method leverages zero-shot scoring algorithms inspired by neural architecture search (NAS). Results demonstrate that intelligent task sequencing can substantially reduce CF. Moreover, when combined with traditional continual learning strategies, sequencing offers enhanced performance and robustness against forgetting. Additionally, the presented approaches can find applications in other fields, such as curriculum learning.

TL;DR: 研究分析《纽约时报》语料库训练的AI分类器中"blacks"标签的偏见问题，发现该标签部分作为"种族主义检测器"运作，但对现代种族议题表现不佳，揭示了新闻业采用AI工具时面临的历史偏见风险。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI技术广泛应用于新闻研究和新闻编辑室，这些基于历史数据训练的模型可能编码了过时的态度和刻板印象。本研究旨在调查《纽约时报》语料库训练的分类器中"blacks"标签的偏见问题，揭示AI工具在新闻业应用中可能复现历史偏见的风险。

Method: 使用《纽约时报》标注语料库训练多标签分类器，通过定量和定性方法分析"blacks"标签在训练语料中的使用情况，应用可解释AI方法探究该标签在分类器中编码的概念，并测试其在现代种族议题（如COVID-19反亚裔仇恨报道和BLM运动报道）上的表现。

Result: 研究发现"blacks"标签部分作为跨少数群体的"种族主义检测器"运作，但在现代种族议题上表现不佳：无法有效识别COVID-19时期的反亚裔仇恨报道，对BLM运动的报道处理也存在问题。这表明基于历史语料训练的模型可能无法适应现代语境。

Conclusion: 新闻编辑室在采用AI工作流工具时面临根本性张力：如何在利用AI效率的同时减少复现历史偏见的风险。案例研究表明，类似应用可能导致意外输出，影响故事发现、受众定位、摘要生成等多种用途，需要谨慎评估和干预。

Abstract: AI technologies have rapidly moved into business and research applications that involve large text corpora, including computational journalism research and newsroom settings. These models, trained on extant data from various sources, can be conceptualized as historical artifacts that encode decades-old attitudes and stereotypes. This paper investigates one such example trained on the broadly-used New York Times Annotated Corpus to create a multi-label classifier. Our use in research settings surfaced the concerning "blacks" thematic topic label. Through quantitative and qualitative means we investigate this label's use in the training corpus, what concepts it might be encoding in the trained classifier, and how those concepts impact our model use. Via the application of explainable AI methods, we find that the "blacks" label operates partially as a general "racism detector" across some minoritized groups. However, it performs poorly against expectations on modern examples such as COVID-19 era anti-Asian hate stories, and reporting on the Black Lives Matter movement. This case study of interrogating embedded biases in a model reveals how similar applications in newsroom settings can lead to unexpected outputs that could impact a wide variety of potential uses of any large language model-story discovery, audience targeting, summarization, etc. The fundamental tension this exposes for newsrooms is how to adopt AI-enabled workflow tools while reducing the risk of reproducing historical biases in news coverage.

*Andrew Wagenmaker,Perry Dong,Raymond Tsao,Chelsea Finn,Sergey Levine*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出PostBC方法，通过建模演示者的后验分布来改进预训练策略，为RL微调提供更好的初始化，相比标准行为克隆能显著提升微调性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前实践中，通常先在大规模演示数据集上预训练策略，然后通过RL微调提升性能。然而，虽然微调算法得到广泛研究，但如何确保预训练策略是RL微调的有效初始化却关注不足。标准行为克隆可能无法覆盖演示者的所有动作，影响后续RL微调效果。

Method: 提出后验行为克隆（PostBC）方法，不直接拟合观察到的演示动作，而是训练策略来建模演示者行为在演示数据集下的后验分布。这种方法仅需标准监督学习，可基于现代生成模型实现，确保覆盖演示者的动作同时保持与BC相当的预训练性能。

Result: 理论分析表明标准BC可能无法覆盖演示者动作，而PostBC能确保这种覆盖。在机器人控制基准测试和真实世界机器人操作任务中，PostBC相比标准BC能显著提升RL微调性能。

Conclusion: PostBC为RL微调提供了更有效的预训练初始化方法，通过建模演示者后验分布确保动作覆盖，在保持预训练性能的同时显著提升后续微调效果，可实际应用于机器人控制领域。

Abstract: Standard practice across domains from robotics to language is to first pretrain a policy on a large-scale demonstration dataset, and then finetune this policy, typically with reinforcement learning (RL), in order to improve performance on deployment domains. This finetuning step has proved critical in achieving human or super-human performance, yet while much attention has been given to developing more effective finetuning algorithms, little attention has been given to ensuring the pretrained policy is an effective initialization for RL finetuning. In this work we seek to understand how the pretrained policy affects finetuning performance, and how to pretrain policies in order to ensure they are effective initializations for finetuning. We first show theoretically that standard behavioral cloning (BC) -- which trains a policy to directly match the actions played by the demonstrator -- can fail to ensure coverage over the demonstrator's actions, a minimal condition necessary for effective RL finetuning. We then show that if, instead of exactly fitting the observed demonstrations, we train a policy to model the posterior distribution of the demonstrator's behavior given the demonstration dataset, we do obtain a policy that ensures coverage over the demonstrator's actions, enabling more effective finetuning. Furthermore, this policy -- which we refer to as the posterior behavioral cloning (PostBC) policy -- achieves this while ensuring pretrained performance is no worse than that of the BC policy. We then show that PostBC is practically implementable with modern generative models in robotic control domains -- relying only on standard supervised learning -- and leads to significantly improved RL finetuning performance on both realistic robotic control benchmarks and real-world robotic manipulation tasks, as compared to standard behavioral cloning.

TL;DR: 本文研究了强化学习可验证奖励（RLVR）框架中的探索-利用权衡问题，揭示了虚假奖励和熵最小化如何通过看似矛盾的机制提升大语言模型的数学推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 最近研究表明，RLVR可以通过两种看似矛盾的机制激发大语言模型的数学推理能力：虚假奖励（通过奖励与真实结果无关的结果来抑制利用）和熵最小化（通过推动模型产生更自信和确定性的输出来抑制探索）。这两种机制都能提升推理性能，但其背后的原理尚不清楚。

Method: 研究聚焦两个基本问题：(1)策略熵与性能的关系；(2)虚假奖励是否通过裁剪偏差和模型污染的相互作用产生收益。提出了奖励错配模型来解释虚假奖励在污染设置之外的性能提升。

Result: 结果显示，虚假奖励下的裁剪偏差会降低策略熵，导致更自信和确定性的输出，而单独的熵最小化不足以带来改进。奖励错配模型解释了虚假奖励如何在非污染设置中提升性能。

Conclusion: 研究阐明了虚假奖励获益的机制，为更有效的RLVR训练提供了原则。虚假奖励通过裁剪偏差降低策略熵，而熵最小化本身不足以提升性能，需要结合奖励错配机制来理解虚假奖励的增益效应。

Abstract: This paper examines the exploration-exploitation trade-off in reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR), a framework for improving the reasoning of Large Language Models (LLMs). Recent studies suggest that RLVR can elicit strong mathematical reasoning in LLMs through two seemingly paradoxical mechanisms: spurious rewards, which suppress exploitation by rewarding outcomes unrelated to the ground truth, and entropy minimization, which suppresses exploration by pushing the model toward more confident and deterministic outputs, highlighting a puzzling dynamic: both discouraging exploitation and discouraging exploration improve reasoning performance, yet the underlying principles that reconcile these effects remain poorly understood. We focus on two fundamental questions: (i) how policy entropy relates to performance, and (ii) whether spurious rewards yield gains, potentially through the interplay of clipping bias and model contamination. Our results show that clipping bias under spurious rewards reduces policy entropy, leading to more confident and deterministic outputs, while entropy minimization alone is insufficient for improvement. We further propose a reward-misalignment model explaining why spurious rewards can enhance performance beyond contaminated settings. Our findings clarify the mechanisms behind spurious-reward benefits and provide principles for more effective RLVR training.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有调度语言被锁定在特定编译器生态系统中，阻碍了公平比较、重用和跨框架评估。目前缺乏统一的接口来解耦调度规范与代码生成和测量。

Method: 引入XTC平台，提供通用API和可复现的测量框架，统一跨编译器的调度和性能评估。

Result: XTC实现了可移植的实验能力，加速了优化策略的研究。

Conclusion: XTC解决了编译器生态系统锁定问题，为AI算子高效调度提供了统一的实验和评估平台。

Abstract: Achieving high efficiency on AI operators demands precise control over computation and data movement. However, existing scheduling languages are locked into specific compiler ecosystems, preventing fair comparison, reuse, and evaluation across frameworks. No unified interface currently decouples scheduling specification from code generation and measurement. We introduce XTC, a platform that unifies scheduling and performance evaluation across compilers. With its common API and reproducible measurement framework, XTC enables portable experimentation and accelerates research on optimization strategies.

TL;DR: 本文首次推导出具有确定性设置时间的多服务器系统(M/M/k/Setup-Deterministic)中平均等待时间的上下界，并提出了MIST新分析方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代系统中服务器经常开关以降低运营成本，但设置时间会对排队性能产生严重影响。现有研究都假设设置时间服从指数分布，而实际设置时间接近确定性，指数假设会导致模型行为不现实并严重低估设置时间的危害。

Method: 提出名为"干预停止时间方法(MIST)"的新技术来分析随机时间积分，用于推导确定性设置时间多服务器系统的平均等待时间上下界。

Result: 首次获得了有限服务器系统设置时间下的闭式等待时间表征，上下界在乘法常数范围内相互接近，并基于这些界推导出简单准确的近似公式。

Conclusion: 该研究填补了多服务器系统确定性设置时间分析的理论空白，为设计既高效又性能良好的现代系统提供了理论基础。

Abstract: In many systems, servers do not turn on instantly; instead, a setup time must pass before a server can begin work. These "setup times" can wreak havoc on a system's queueing; this is especially true in modern systems, where servers are regularly turned on and off as a way to reduce operating costs (energy, labor, CO2, etc.). To design modern systems which are both efficient and performant, we need to understand how setup times affect queues.
  Unfortunately, despite successes in understanding setup in a single-server system, setup in a multiserver system remains poorly understood. To circumvent the main difficulty in analyzing multiserver setup, all existing results assume that setup times are memoryless, i.e. distributed Exponentially. However, in most practical settings, setup times are close to Deterministic, and the widely used Exponential-setup assumption leads to unrealistic model behavior and a dramatic underestimation of the true harm caused by setup times.
  This paper provides a comprehensive characterization of the average waiting time in a multiserver system with Deterministic setup times, the M/M/k/Setup-Deterministic. In particular, we derive upper and lower bounds on the average waiting time in this system, and show these bounds are within a multiplicative constant of each other. These bounds are the first closed-form characterization of waiting time in any finite-server system with setup times. Further, we demonstrate how to combine our upper and lower bounds to derive a simple and accurate approximation for the average waiting time. These results are all made possible via a new technique for analyzing random time integrals that we named the Method of Intervening Stopping Times, or MIST.
